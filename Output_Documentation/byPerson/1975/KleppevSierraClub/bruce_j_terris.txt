mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
rely
expressly
on
the
proposal
language
and
let
me
be
very
clear
about
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
for
major
federal
action.
your
honors,
there
have
already
been
dozens,
not
a
proposals
but
a
federal
actions
which
have
taken
place
since
nepa
without
an
adequate
regional,
environmental
impact
statement.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
a
matter
of
timing.
if
anything,
we
are
getting
too
late
in
the
process
not
too
early.
what
we
have
is
a
set
of
proposals,
some
of
which
have
already
been
acted
upon
and
minds
have
actually
been
opened.
we
have
in
addition
literally
hundreds
of
additional
proposals
which
are
coming
in
front
of
interior.
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
in
order
to
approve
any
of
those
proposals
to
take
action,
the
secretary
of
interior
has
to
have
at
that
time
a
comprehensive
regional
environmental
impact
statement.
now,
in
our
mind
that
is
expressly
under
section
102.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
exactly.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
exactly
your
honor.
now,
what
we
have
here
let
us
just
take,
we
can
take
any
one
mine
of
dozens
that
are
involved.
let
us
take
the
four
that
were
approved
by
the
secretary
after
this
court
lifted
the
injunction
in
january.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
went
ahead
and
approved
four
mines.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
are
among
i
hesitate
trying
to
tell
you
which
of
those
numbers
in
the
eastern
powder
river
basin
they
are
but
they
are
among
those
numbers.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
quite
right
your
honor.
and
he
approved
them.
now
in
approving
them
we
say,
that
in
taking
that
actions,
we
have
really
going
beyond
the
proposal.
we
have
actually
--
the
proposal
language
of
nepa
actually
requires
a
statement
on
an
earlier
stage.
we
have
really
going
beyond
that,
where
to
the
point
that
he
has
acted
and
minds
are
going
to
be
opened.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
now,
let
me
come
to
express
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
let
me
deal
with
that
expressly
your
honor.
this
is
the
document
and
it
is
the
document
that
my
brother
has
pointed
you.
that
document
is
not
in
this
case
and
i
will
tell
you
exactly
why.
it
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
district
court,
rendered
its
decision.
a
draft
of
this
document
was
in
existence
when
this
case
was
in
front
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
submitted
that
draft
as
well
as
the
draft
of
the
programmatic
statement
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
clerk
acting
for
the
court
wrote
them
a
letter
and
said
it
to
them,
why
have
you
given
us
this
document?
the
government
replied
for
your
information
it
is
irrelevant
to
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
they
are
not
let
me
go
one
step
further
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
let
me
be
clear
about
this.
remember
with
the
court
of
appeals
decided
here.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
a
final
determination
in
this
case.
it
remanded
the
case.
if
the
government's
position
is
today
which
i
think
maybe
it
is
from
my
brother’s
argument
that
this
statement,
now
is
relevant
and
does
satisfy
the
requirements
of
a
regional
statement,
then
i
submit
that
is
a
proper
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
let
me
then
go
back
to
step
your
honor.
our
argument
is
that
in
considering
a
proposal
and
in
taking
action,
the
federal
government
has
to
do
a
statement
which
is
regional
that
is
the
issue
of
law
okay,
okay--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but,
your
honor,
to
get
to
that
question
we
have
passed
the
question,
is
there
are
a
proposal
and
is
there
action?
then
the
question,
in
which
i
think
is
where
we
are
at
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
let
me,
let
me--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
has
there
been
regional
proposal?
well,
let
me
tell
you
exactly
what
there
has
been--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they,
i
think
in
our
view
there
has
been
a
regional
analysis
and
decisions
made
by
the
federal
government
and
let
me
be
very
precise
on
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
a
proposal,
you
see
it
is
action
i
really
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
has
been
regional
actions,
proposals
and
actions.
let
me
be
very
express
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
look
at
--
i
would
refer
you
to
the
finding
14
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
hold,
finds
as
a
fact,
it
is
in
the
petition,
it
is
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
of
the
government
your
honor
and
it
is
in
the
back.
the
district
court
finds
as
a
fact
that
the
government
is
attempting
to
control
development,
control
development
in
the
northern
great
plains
region,
that
finding
is
expressly
based
on
an
affidavit
of
secretary
morgan
that
they
have
taken
steps
namely,
the
northern
great
plains
resource
program
and
other
actions
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
14.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
says
they
are
not
part
of
a
plan
or
program
to
develop
or
encourage
development
but
our
attempts
to
control
development
by
individual
companies
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
policies
and
procedures
of
nepa.
now,
i
submit
to
you
that
if
he
is
controlling
development
in
the
northern
great
plains
region,
he
cannot
control
development
and
analyze
the
situation
on
a
project
by
project
basis.
let
me
come
back
to
justice
brennan
question--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
a
proposal,
i
suppose,
the
way
to
put
expressly
in
terms
of
this
finding
--yes,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
want
to
get
to
it.
i
want
to
put
it
in
terms
of
finding
14,
i
think
at
the
very
least
that
an
attempt
to
control
development
is
a
proposal
and
beyond
it,
it
is
an
attempt,
he
has
not
actually
proposed
that
he
may
do
that,
he
has
said
--
the
finding
is
he
is
attempting
to
do
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
quite
correct
your
honor.
now
the
question
in
this
case,
really
the
root
question
is.
can
the
government
attempt
to
control
development,
issue
dozens
of
mining
leases,
approve
rail
roads,
start
probably
the
largest
industrial
development
in
the
history
of
this
country
in
a
rural
area,
all
with
its
decisions,
can
it
do
that?
and
say,
yes
we
would
have
to
do
in
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
the
region,
if
we
did
planning,
but,
since
we
are
not
going
to
do
any
planning,
we
are
excused
from
it.
in
other
words
the
argument
is
the
less
we
do
under
nepa,
the
less
nepa
requires
us
to
do.
now,
nepa
three
separate
times
talks
about
federal
planning.
is
it
conceivable
that
the
congress
in
united
states
said,
that
if
you
are
controlling
development
and
issuing
leases
and
doing
all
this
things
that
is
simply
because
you
will
not
plan,
that
you
do
not
have
to
so
any
regional
analysis.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
am
saying
that,
i
am
asking
the
question
because
that
is
the
issue
in
the
case.
i
do
not
think
the
congress
has
said
that
either,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
rewrite
it
your
honor.
i
think
the
issue
is
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case
there
has
been
clearly
a
proposal
and
we
have
going
beyond
the
proposal.
now,
the
question
is,
when
you
have
a
proposal
--.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
you
are
attempting
to
control
development,
it
is
at
least
fair
to
say
you
are
proposing
to
control
development.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
do.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
is
more
than
a
proposal.
you
are
taking
action,
you
are
not
in
attempt
is
more
than
a
proposal,
it
is
an
action.
you
are
going
forward
with
doing
something.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
specific
studies
that
are
mentioned
in
finding
14
are
both
regional
studies
on
this
region.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
want
to---
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
let
me
be
clear
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
department
of
interior
has
sat
down
and
said
here
is
our
program
for
development
in
the
northern
great
plains,
i
do
not
believe
that
has
happened.
i
do
not
believe
they
are
planning.
the
question
your
honor
is
when
they
do
all
these
different
things
and
they
attempt
to
control
development,
i
think
the
finding
is
very
clear
that
is
what
they
are
doing
and
by
the
way,
their
finding
your
honor,
is
based
--
let
me
just
go
to
the
underlying
facts
on
which
their
finding
was
based.
secretary
morgan's
affidavit
says
that
the
department
has
taken
action
to
control
development
of
coal
on
a
national
basis
and
in
the
northern
great
plains.
now,
that
is
what
that
finding
is
based
on,
there
are
some
other
facts
too,
that
support
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
there
are
really
two
issues
in
this
case
and
they
are
really
sub
issues.
the
first
issue
is
do
you
have
to
do
a
regional
statement
at
all,
is
there
any
requirements
in
nepa
that
require
you
do
anything
more
then
look
at
the
specific
strip
mine
which
is
in
front
of
you
that
i
submit
to
you
your
honors.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but,
i
am
saying
your
honor,
but---
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
am
saying
that
they
both
had
a
regional
proposal
and
they
had
so
many
individual
proposals
that
they
have
to
be
even
separate
from
the
first
proposition,
they
have
to
be
analyzed
regionally.
let
me
go
back
to
justice
powell’s
point
because
it
seems
to
me
it
isolates
the
two
basic
questions
here,
one
is
do
you
ever
have
to
look
beyond
a
specific
topic
that
government
is
considering
at
that
moment,
that
is
the
first
issue
and
i
regard
that
as
the
basic
issue.
the
second
issue
is
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes
you
do
sometimes
have
to
then
what
should
the
size
of
the
region
be
here?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
that
is
correct
and
if
the
government's
position
had
ever
been
that
what
they
proposed
to
do
was
in
the
context
of
an
individual
project
to
look
at
the
entire
interrelationship
in
the
region
there
would
not
have
been
any
litigation.
the
government
position
from
the
start
and
is
still
is
today
that
they
do
not
have
to
look
beyond
a
specific
project.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
could
your
honor
and
there
is
a
procedural
question
which
was
argued
in
the
courts
below
which
has
not
been
argued
in
this
court
as
to
whether
procedurally,
the
way
we
should
have
proceeded,
instead
of
coming
in
and
isolating
this
basic
question
which
cuts
across
the
board
or
whether
we
should
have
literally
brought
separate
law
suits
against
every
single
environmental
impact
statement,
which
is
as
--
because
it
does
not
look
at
the
whole
region.
now,
that
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
is
a
basic
question
except
for
in
terms
for
judicial
economy.
i
think
if
we
had
ever
brought
one
lawsuit
after
another
of
that
kind,
it
would
have
been
thought
that
that
was
a
very
improper
way
for
us
to
proceed.
but
that
is
not
the
basic
issue
i
quite
agree,
if
your
honors
believed
that
the
way
for
us
to
proceed
in
the
future
is
to
attack
each
statement
separately
then
of
course
we
will
do
so.
but
i
think
the
basic
question
in
front
of
you.
is
it
not
that
procedural
one
that
whether
when
the
government
makes
clear
that
its
position
is
that
they
are
not
required
by
nepa
to
do
regional
statements
that
in
that
context,
they
do
not
have
to
look
beyond
an
individual
mine.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
interior
department
your
honor
and
the
interior
department
drew
the
line.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
let
me
be
very
clear
about
that.
the
line
we
want
is
the
department
of
interiors
line
and
let
me
go
back
to
the
map
that
was
given
to
you
because
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
let
me
go
back
–
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
they
do
in
one
sense
but
let
me
go
back
to
the
map
which
is
distributed
to
you.
if
you
look
on
the
left
hand
side
under
explanation
it
is
said,
there
is
a
line
there
that
says,
outline
of
the
northern
great
plains
coal
field.
now,
it
is
a
very
faint
line
in
the
map
that
you
will
see
it
winding
around
and
that
line
is
the
identical
line
which
is
in
our
map
in
the
brief,
which
is
the
northern
great
plains
resource
program
study
area,
the
area
that
they
have
chosen
to
control
development,
a
1975
water
study
of
the
interior
department,
statements
by
secretary
morgan,
that
you
had
to
do
study
of
this
area
in
order
to
control
and
coordinate
development,
statements
by
the
administrator
of
epa,
that
this
was
the
right
area,
statements
by
the
council
and
environmental
quality
that
this
was
the
right
area.
your
honor,
i
am
going
to
a
different
question
i
believe
when
i
go
to
this.
i
am
going
to
the
question
if
you
assume
that
we
have
met
the
statute
that
there
are
proposals.
then
i
am
going
to
the
question,
what
is
the
right
area
for
analysis?
and
what
i
am
saying
your
honors
is
i
agree
completely
that
the
department
of
interior
has
considerable
discretion
in
determining
what
is
the
proper
region.
what
i
am
suggesting
here
your
honors
is
that
they
have
repeatedly
over
and
over
and
over
again
said
the
right
region
for
environmental
analysis
under
nepa
is
the
identical
region
which
we
have
argued,
there
should
be
a
regional
analysis.
now,
that
is
not
a
coincidence
that
we
came
to
the
same
area,
the
reason
that
we
came
to
it
is
because
this
are
geological
facts.
the
government
has
submitted
a
brief
showing
there
are
lots
of
other
coal
in
the
united
states,
that
is
true.
but
they
are
not
in
the
same
geological
formation
and
the
department
of
the
interior
made
the
decision,
that
the
right
area,
the
right
geological
formation
was
this
one.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
to
justice
powell’s
question,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
is
really
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case,
i
want
to
explain
that.
if
this
is
the
right
region,
let
us
make
an
assumption
right
now
that
the
sub
regions
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
way
interior
describes
them,
that
the
sub
regions
are
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
honor,
that
leads
me
i
think
to
the
basic
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
believe
your
honor,
they
tend
to
be
subdivided
at
least
in
the
start,
different
regional
offices
and
different
offices
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
and
other
federal
agencies
that
are
in
the
field.
in
other
words,
there
is--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
your
honor.
let
me
explain
the
ramifications
of
what
we
are
now
dealing
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
brennan’s
earlier
question.
everybody
believes
your
honor
that
you
have
to
look
beyond
the
individual
project,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
that.
this
statement,
this
sub
regional
statement
makes
the
same
assumptions
that
we
do.
namely
you
cannot
look
at
a
mine
by
it
self,
you
have
to
take
a
region.
now,
they
have
taken
a
much
smaller
region
but
they
have
taken
a
region
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
great
length
how
one
federal
agency
after
another
epa,
cq,
interior,
all
the
other
line
agencies
that
deals
with
this
problem
have
all
agreed
that
you
cannot
look
at
individual
statements
by
themselves.
now,
the
government,
we
set
out
by
the
way
at
great
length
in
our
brief,
how
secretary
kleppe
has
essentially
agreed
with
our
position,
on
february,
on
january
26,
he
stated
that
he
had
made
a
determination,
it
is
on
appendix
to
our
briefs,
the
documents.
he
had
made
a
determination
that
indeed
you
did
have
to
do
regional
statements.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
said
its—
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
forum
was
your
honor,
that
when
he
makes
final
decision
at
least
on
big
issues,
he
has
what
is
called
is
a
program
decision
option
document.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
it
was
announced
through
a
press
conference
your
honor.
but,
the
document
is
in
the
back,
it
is
not
a
press
release,
it
is
the
actual
decision
document
that
he
signed.
it
took
them;
he
had
a
press
conference
in
and
he
released
it
to
the
press.
but
we
are
not
relying
on
a
simply
a
press
release.
now
he
then
told
the
senate
committee
the
same
thing
a
few
weeks
later
that
he
decided
to
do
sub
regional
statements.
he
has
done
one,
two
are
about
to
be
started
in
north
dakota
and
south
eastern
montana,
two
others
are
under
consideration
in
a
priority
list.
now,
at
least
we
believe
that
he
has
made
the
determination,
which
we
have
argued
for
from
the
beginning.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
one
more
issue
to
decide
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
basic
issue
although,
i
think
the
government
by
the
way
will
dispute
that
is
mode
even
on
the
point
i
have
just
been
making.
they
want
to
say
that
the
secretary
has
started
this
process
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart.
nepa
did
not
require
that
he
do
this
and
he
that
means
presumably
could
change
his
mind
at
any
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
are,
they
did
not
do
it
though
however,
before
nepa
was
on
the
books
that
is
of
course
why
need
help
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
mean
it
is
kind
of
environmental
analysis.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
with
all
respect
i
disagree
very
strongly.
i
think
the
history
of
nepa
shows
how
little
indeed
they
did
this
kind
of
thing
before
1970
and
that
what
nepa
has
done,
it
has
started
really
a
major
revolution
in
a
way
that
federal
agencies
proceed
in
terms
of
the
environment
and
i
this
is
a
constructive
step
along
that
line.
i
would
just
point
out
that
even
if
this
document
on
eastern
powder
river
basin
is
adequate
and
your
honors
say
that
is
the
right
region.
i
would
remind
you
that
there
had
been
no
such
statements
on
any
other
part
of
the
region,
that
at
least
four-fifth
of
the
region
has
not
been
analyzed
at
all
and,
that
is
what
they
are
just
beginning
to
do.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
not
only
you
do
not
have
to,
i
think
your
honor
it
will
be
improper
to.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
am
not
your
honor.[laughter]
i
remind
you
that
i
did
not
bring
this
pile
of
documents
in
front
of
you
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
is
relevant
except
for
the
fact
that
i
think
what
is
relevant
is
that
the
department
of
interior
has
decided.
yes,
indeed,
it
does
do
regional,
sub
regional
statements.
but,
it
does
not
intend
to
do
regional
statements
and
i
think
the
major
issue
you
have
fun
you
did
is
left.
the
major
issue
of
dispute
is
the
question
whether
we
are
correct
in
taking
interiors
on
lines
and
saying
they
yes
indeed
that
is
the
right
area.
because
i
do
not
think
we
have
a
major
dispute
with
interior,
on
the
question
of
whether
sub
regional
or
regional
statements
have
to
be
done.
i
do
think
we
have
a
dispute
with
the
department
of
justice
to
be
very
frank
about
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
quite
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
why
i
think
that
it
is
not
moot
in
any
kind--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
no,
no,
no
your
honor,
let
me--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
let
me
be
clear
about
it,
i
rely
on
interior's
new
found
policy
of
doing
sub
regional
statements,
has
confirming
our
view
and
that
of
vpa
and
ceq
that
regional
analysis
is
required
by
nepa.
in
other
words
i
think
that
is
the
court---
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
department
of
justice
says
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
quite
correct
your
honor.
but
secretary
kleppe
said
in
his
program
decision
option
document
i
think
it
is
very
clear
if
you
look
at
it,
that
t
nepa
required
these
actions
and
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
is
what
the
secretary
was
doing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
you
should
give
deference
to
that,
i
think
even
more
than
your
honor.
i
think
the
proper
interpreter
of
nepa,
the
one
that
congress
and
the
president
have
both
charge
with
interpreting
nepa
happen
to
be
epa
and
ceq,
now
i
do
--
i
think
that
interior
is
entitle
to
some
deference
too.
here,
i
think
there
is
a
coincidence
which
has
occurred
in
which
all
three
agencies
have
found
that
regional
analysis
is
required
by
the
act.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
am
not
sure
what
the
interior
thinks
your
honor.
let
me
say
what
i
think.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
nepa
that
in
order
to
carry
out
our
nepa
responsibilities,
we
are
going
to
do
a
sub
regional
statement,
i
think--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
but
i
want
to
be
clear
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
think
it
was
enough.
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
stated
–
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
but
you
did
not
say
that
a
contemplated
action
was
enough,
it
expressly
said
the
contrary.
it
said
although
it
thought
that
action
was
contemplated
it
was
going
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
in
order
to
be
determine
whether
the
federal
role,
in
other
words
the
district
court
was
going
to
determine
what
kinds
of
actions
really
were
going
to
be
taken.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
did
not
use
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
those
words
because
there
was
no
plan
or
program.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
but
it
said
that
that
is
all
they
could
find
now.
so,
it
was
contemplated.
therefore,
it
was
not
making
a
determination
that
are--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
did
not.
the
holding
is
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
your
honor
they
thought
they
that
the
issue
was
unclear
about
the
role
of
the
federal
government--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
at
that
point
your
honor,
it
was
contemplated.
i
think
by
the
way
that
is
a
very
conservative
view
with
of
the
facts
before
the
court
of
appeals
but
taking
that
conservative
view,
the
court
of
appeals
then
said,
we
are
remanding
to
the
district
court
to
determining
what
the
role
of
the
federal
government
actually
would
be.
now,
that
is
directly
consistent,
i
submit
was
scrap.
that
you
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
the
federal
government
was
really
going
to
take
these
kinds
of
actions.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
part,
you
are
right
your
honor.
but,
i
think
not
completely,
i
think
the
fact
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
have
to
change
at
least
one
part
of
that
statement.
the
each
individual
part
were
not
smaller
actions.
each
one
of
them
is
actually
a
huge
actions.
each
one
of
those
actions,
for
example
has,
in
a
government
i
think
conceives
this
that
each
one
of
those
is
a
major
federal
action
under
nepa.
so
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
in
a
situation
and
the
court
by
the
way
expressly
came
down
on
this
language
about
control
development.
we
are
controlling
development,
where
you
have
dozen
or
hundreds
of
actions,
where
now
it
turns
out
the
federal
government
itself
admits
they
have
to
do
regional
analysis.
that
in
that
kind
of
situation,
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
region
and
i
think--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
he
was
clearly
wrong
and
i
think
he
was
clearly
wrong
your
honor
on
a
proposition
that
i
think
the
federal
government
will
agree
with
me
because
they
are
each
individually
your
honor
actions
in
which
they
admit
they
have
to
do
environmental
impact
statements.
the
mines
were
talking
but
just
so
we
understand
what
were
talking
about,
each
one
of
these,
each
mine
is
among
the
largest
mines
in
united
states
it
has
each
one
of
the
mines
has
several
square
miles
of
area.
it
is
doubtful
according
to
the
federal
government
itself
that
these
lands
will
be
reclaimed
for
dozens
of
years
in
prompt
and
maybe
not
forever.
we
are
talking
about
power
plants
and
coal
gasification
plants
of
a
size
that
are
among
the
largest
in
the
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honor,
let
me
come
back
because
i
think
i
--
to
the
statute
because
obviously
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
once
we
decide
we
have
got
a
proposal
or
an
action,
that
triggers
the
environmental
impact
statement
requirement
and
i
have
argued
at
length
about
why
i
think
that
there
is
such
a
proposal
and
action.
in
fact,
there
are
many
of
them
and
that
they
are
tied
together
by
controlling
development.
now
then
the
question,
the
question
you
have
to
decide
that
is
what
should
be
the
scope
of
the
environmental
statement.
now,
i
submit
that
the
way
you
determine
that
is
to
look
to
the
five
factors
in
102
(2)(c)
you
look
to
what
area
you
have
to
examine
in
order
to
determine
the
environmental
impacts
and
the
alternatives
to
the
project.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
practical
question
that
one
is
dealing
with
at
that
point.
and,
ceq
has
said
the
way
you
look
at
that
giving
a
gloss
on
that
is
whether
there
was
an
inner
relationship,
the
three
adverbs
that
come
from
ceq
they
do
not
come
from
us.
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
right.
those
come
from
ceq
and
they
are
gloss
on
how
do
you
look
at
those
five
factors
and
analyze
them
when
you
have
interrelationships
between
projects.
now,
we
say
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
area
that
i
would
not
make
that
argument
your
honors,
simply
analogical
basis,
i
think
it
is
true
logically,
we
have
argued
link
in
our
brief
that
it
is
logically
true.
but
our
basic
proposition
is
they
decided
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
whole
region
to
analyze
those
five
factors.
you
will
see
in
our
brief
that
epa
said
you
had
to
do
that,
secretary
morgan
said
you
had
to
do
that,
the
northern
great
plains
resource
program
said
you
do
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
you
only
get
to
that
proposition
after
you
first
decided
whether
regional
analysis
has
to
be
done
at
all
and
then
you
get
to
that
proposition.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
he
was
arbitrary
in
the
light
of
his
own
and
other
federal
agency
prior
decisions
and
actions.
thank
you.
