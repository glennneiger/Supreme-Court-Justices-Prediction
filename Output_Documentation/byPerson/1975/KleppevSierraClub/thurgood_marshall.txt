mr.
randolph?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see
you
got
three
proposed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
of
them
is
in
your
area,
is
it
not?
one
is
in
the
powder?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
real
point
is
that
eventually
interior
is
going
to
have
to
broaden
its
area
and
file
a
report
broader
than
it
has
and
when
it
does
it
will
have
to
have
an
impact
statement,
all
in
the
future.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
know
what
statute
you
are
going
get
that
under?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
relying
on
the
nepa
act,
that
is
all
you
are
relying
on,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
are
not
under
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
that
interior
should
be
in
a
position
so
that
they
would
have
to
follow
the
statement
until
they
file
a
report
or
take
and
move
in
that
direction,
you
lose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
we
have
is
that
they
have
been
studying
it
and
that
is
all
you
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
interior
been
doing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
exactly,
the
way
they
are
doing
it,
that
instead
of
doing
it
piece
by
piece
they
should
do
it
all
in
a
region
then.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
have
it.
we
do
not
know
what
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
problem
that
seems
to
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
my
idea
of
a
proposal
is
not
yours.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
is
better
qualified
to
draw
the
lines
of
a
region
in
this
area,
the
interior
department
or
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
not
asking
us
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
is
stated,
their
line
is
the
powder
basin,
that
is
their
line.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
not
what
they
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
that
you
are
even
suggesting
--
