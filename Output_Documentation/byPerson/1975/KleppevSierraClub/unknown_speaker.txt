unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
had
the
impression
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
did
not
contrive
this
area
though,
that
they
found
this
area
in
a
lot
of
work
that
had
been
done
by
the
government
one
way
or
another
and
there
is
some
basis
for
--
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
attribute
this,
the
arbitrary
selection
to
them
or
to
the
government?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
that,
are
you
saying
that
the
area
they
described
is
one
that
they
defined
initially
without
any
reference
to
prior
government
tentative
proposal
or
tentative
planning
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
the
neighboring
state
of
utah
has
not
joined
you
in
your
briefs
has
it?
unknown
speaker
as
matter
of
fact,
it
is
one
of
the
brief
from
the
other
probably
from
the
other
side?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
their
experience
is
somewhat
different
than
yours?
unknown
speaker
what
will
you
do
with
the
language
of
the
statute?
well,
there
have
been
a
regional
federal
proposal?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
if
they
say
there
is
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
only
time
you
submit
an
impact
statement
is
when
the
federal
government
makes
a
report
on
a
proposal
and
there
has
not
been
a
report
on
a
proposal
on
a
regional
basis?
unknown
speaker
where
is
it?
that
is
what
i
asked
you,
where
is
the
report?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
suggest
the
case
go
forward?
have
a
law
suit
and
call
people
from
interior
department
and
ask
them
if
they
have
a
proposal
or
plan?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
not
think
before
under
the
statute
would
you
not
have
to
find
that
there
was
a
proposal
somewhere
for
a
regional
plan?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know,
but
until
you
find
that,
is
it
not
the
requirement
for
an
impact
state
limited
to
the
project
that
has
been
proposed?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
sufficient
if
all
i
have
in
mind
or
if
the
only
proposal
that
ever
has
been
made
is
for
a
project?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
statute
is
concerned
at
least
a
few,
just
limit
consideration
to
the
words
on
their
face,
before
they
trigger
an
impact
statement
there
has
to
be
a
recommendation
or
report
on
something,
and
it
goes
on
the
say
--
there
are
enough
proposals
for
legislation
in
other
major
federal
actions.
but
unless
we
can
say
that
something
or
the
court
could
say
that
something
constitutes
recommendational
report
on
one
of
those
things,
statute
does
not
call
for
impact
statements,
does
it?
in
other
words
what
is
major
federal
action
that
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
what
is
finding
of
the
district
court
quite
to
the
contrary,
that
there
was
no
--
that
the
only
proposal
there
was,
was
a
project
proposal?
unknown
speaker
or
did
the
court
of
appeals
set
that
aside,
find
it
was
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
one?
unknown
speaker
that
is
left
to
your
--
is
it
yes,
on
this
map,
left
to
the
powder
river
valley?
unknown
speaker
there
were
five
or
six?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
we
recently
had
an
extraordinary
increase
in
population
down
the
rock
springs
area?
unknown
speaker
was
that
attributable
to
a
coal
development
or
to
something
else?
unknown
speaker
some
was?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
how
many
projects
does
it
run.
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
any
attack
on
the
sufficiency
of
that
impact
statement?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
in
connection
with
each
of
those
proposals,
was
there
included
in
it,
the
report
there
on
an
impact
statement?
unknown
speaker
why
does
it
not
satisfy
--
unknown
speaker
are
the
four
leases
that
you
rely
on
also
irrelevant
that
--
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean,
you
can
talk
about
the
leases
unless
they
can
also
talk
about
what
they
did
as
a
condition
to
agreeing
to
the
leases?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
was
that
that
satisfies
the
requirement
for
the
regional
statement.
that
it
satisfies
the
requirements
of
the
statute
in
respect
to
these
four
leases?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
coming
from?
unknown
speaker
assuming
there
has
been
some
regional
proposal.
unknown
speaker
is
it
fair
enough
to
take?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
yes
or
no
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
the
words
of
the
statute
are
that
--
unknown
speaker
the
regional
proposal?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
try
to
get
to
it?
unknown
speaker
he
has
no
plan
or
program
to
develop
or
encourage
development?
unknown
speaker
some
proposal?
unknown
speaker
just
to
be
sure
i
understand.
you
are
saying
finding
14,
supports
your
view
that
there
is
program
for
regional
development.
now,
as
i
read
finding
14,
most
of
the
references
are
to
national
programs
of
one
kind
or
another
and
the
specific
language
you
talked
about
are
attempts
to
control
development
by
individual
companies?
unknown
speaker
the
first
one
is
on
a
national
basis
and
the
second
one
is
south
eastern
montana
and
north
eastern
wyoming.
unknown
speaker
which
is
different
from
the
region
you
described?
unknown
speaker
the
third
is
the
national
coal
leasing
policy
and
then
the
fourth
is
the
indian
lands
and
the
ngprp,
the
credit
group
of
different
thing,
is
this
your
strongest
finding
in
support
of
your
position
that
there
is
a
regional
program?
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position
that
the
action
that
has
been
taken
i
think
you
have
characterized
that
as
study
in
other
ways,
focuses
precisely
on
the
same
regional
area
that
you
are
recommending?
unknown
speaker
that
will
have
to
be
yes,
if
in
fact
the
interior
came
up
with
a
proposal
for
legislation
or
other
major
federal
action
on
a
regional
basis,
of
course
there
will
be
regional
impacts.
unknown
speaker
why
are
you
saying
they
did
do
that,
that
is
what
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you
just
what
we
have
been
telling
you
project
by
project.
but,
really
are
we
not
talking
about
difference
about
one
over
all
region
in
five
sub
region,
and
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
i
will
just
ask
one
question
about
it,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
are
the
five
sub
regional
impact
statements
are
all
prepared
in
the
same
office,
under
the
same
supervision?
are
they
working
entirely
autonomously?
unknown
speaker
does
it
satisfy
your
purpose.
if
we
had
the
five
sub
regional
statements
and
then
they
bound
them
all
together
in
one
great
huge
volume
with
a
long
introduction
sort
of
talking
about
the
things
that
overlap
them
among
the
three?
there
is
no
harm
in
having
the
five
sub
regional
statement
i
guess?
unknown
speaker
is
that
press
conference
or—
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
is
sort
of
an
administrative
interpretation
of
statute,
which
we
should
get
that
one?
unknown
speaker
now,
which
are
you
saying
that
they
say,
that
the
regional,
sub
region
statement
is
required
because
a
sub
regional
statement
is
the
natural
requirement
of
a
project
proposal?
unknown
speaker
or
are
you
saying
that
the
department
of
interior
had
said
they
have
a
sub
regional
proposal?
unknown
speaker
i
am
certainly
relying
on
secretary
kleppe's
decision,
now
did
he
say
they
have
a
regional
proposal
or
that
for
some
reason
or
another
we
are
going
to
do
a
sub
regional
statement?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
hold
a
comprehensive
major
federal
action
is
contemplated
in
the
northern
great
plains
and
therefore,
what,
do
you
think
that
is
enough
that
some
of
the
major
federal
action
is
contemplated?
unknown
speaker
well
it
went
on
from
there;
it
went
on
from
there
to
say
that
the
district
court's
contrary
conclusion
was
an
error
and
that
then
went
on
statute
in
order
further
proceedings
based
on
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
found
that
was
no
any
proposal,
any
regional
proposal?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
acted
there
was
a
--
court
of
appeals
seems
to
concede
there
was
not,
that
they
agreed
that
there
was
no
any
plan
or
proposal?
is
that
something
that
is
contemplated?
unknown
speaker
but
how
could
they
ever
say
that
up
to
that
very
moment
an
impact
statement
was
required?
unknown
speaker
why
should
they
not
have
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
it
was
very
clear
enough
that
it
was
only
contemplated.
unknown
speaker
one
thing
we
have
not
really
address,
you
said,
there
should
be
one
overall
regional
statement
instead
of
five
sub
regions,
why?
unknown
speaker
the
environmental
and
geographically
and
programmatically.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shea,
before
you
leave
that
point
that
judge
mckinnon
in
his
dissent
made
the
point
that
the
commitment
of
the
granting
of
approval
in
one
area
does
not
necessarily
involved
in
commitment
to
grant
approval
in
other
areas.
in
other
words,
he
took
the
position
of
these
five
regions
or
perhaps
even
individual
projects,
are
not
sufficiently
inter
dependent
to
require
any
one
overall
statements.
your
opponent
argues
that
we
need
one
statement
for
the
entire
area.
but
i
like
you
to
tell
me
is
whether
we
need
to
decide
that
issue
or
not?
you
understand
my
question;
do
we
have
to
agree
with
judge
mckinnon
on
the
point
that
the
entire
area
is
not
inter
dependent
in
order
to
agree
with
his
ultimate
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
we
agree
with
that
then
we
do
not
have
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it
maybe
that
if
one
project
necessarily
determines
the
shape
or
form
or
outcome
of
another
that
having
a
plan
for
this
project
necessarily
means
you
have
a
plan
for
the
other
one.
unknown
speaker
what
is
exactly
the
question?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
they
are
integrated?
unknown
speaker
certainly
no,
but
judge
mckinnon
apparently
thought
that
he
had
to
decide
if
you
want
you
can
do
it.
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand
(inaudible)
a
series
of
projects
were
wholly
unrelated,
if
the
interior
department
actually
had
a
plan
for
the
development
or
proposal
of
the
whole
area,
there
would
have
to
have
an
area
impact
statement?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
proposal.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
there
would
be
something
that
was
not
there
before
if
you
got
a
proposal?
unknown
speaker
before
in
your
area—
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
is
against
on
you
on
that.
unknown
speaker
on
they
say
over,
they
say
that
they
apparently
they
think
the
possibility
is
that
the
interior
department
has
gone
far
enough
along
the
line
and
towards
a
proposal
to
trigger
the
need
for
an
instance.
unknown
speaker
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
a
proposal
whether
you
call
it
a
program,
a
plan
or
i
think
the
language
was
or
nothing
at
all.
