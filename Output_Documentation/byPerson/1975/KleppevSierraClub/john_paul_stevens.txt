mr.
randolph,
it
is
true
thought,
is
it
not
that
in
a
challenge
to
a
particular
impact
statement
relating
to
a
particular
mining
lease,
the
argument
might
be
made
that
it
is
inadequate
because
it
does
not
sufficiently
discuss
regional
consequences?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
might
in
such
a
challenge
ask
for
the
same
thing
seems
to
be
asking
for
here?
