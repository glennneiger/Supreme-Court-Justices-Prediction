mr.
francis
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
that
finding
14
again.
that
is
on
page
98,
yes
in
the
petition
for
cert.
department
of
the
interior
has
taken
action
to
control
development
on
a
national
basis
and
they
have
with
their
programmatic
on
a
national
basis
and
their
leasing
policy
on
a
national
basis.
that
covers
the
whole
nation
including
the
northern
great
plains,
it
says
on
a
number
of
variable
thing
but
what
is
this
talking
about
is
you
will
get
down
to
the
end.
those
actions
however,
are
not
part
of
a
plan
or
program
to
develop
or
encourage
development
or
rather
attempts
to
control
development
by
individual
companies
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
policies
and
procedure
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
i
do
not
see
how
this
can
be
relied
on
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
government
of
the
interior
has
undertaken
to
control
development
of
the
region.
except
as
they
are
controlling
development
of
pursuant
to
a
leasing
program
which
applies
to
the
whole
nation.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
of
course
if
the
court
please,
there
has
been
no
change
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
interior,
initial
affidavit
which
was
put
in
by
secretary
morgan
set
out
that
we
completed
this
coal
programmatic
and
we
have
the
information
from
the
northern
great
plains
resources
program.
we
will
decide
possibly,
we
will
have
an
impact
statement
from
the
whole
region
that
possibly
the
purposes
of
nepa
will
be
better
served
by
preparing
an
impact
statement
on
an
individual
project
or
on
certain
sub
regions
or
on
the
basis
of
basin
boundaries
et
cetera.
and,
this
is
exactly
what
secretary
kleppe
is
saying
today.
now,
indeed,
of
course
the
studies
are
going
all
the
time
and
what
they
finally
decide
on
is
what
subject
they
will,
what
major
federal
action
they
will
decide
to
carry
forward.
now,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
if
it
will
to
return
to
the
statute
and
to
scrap
two
which
it
seems
to
me
says
that
the
statute
means
what
it
says.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
very
different
question
presented
on
what
is,
what
interior
is
compelled
to
do,
what
they
must
do
under
this
statute
and
what
they
find
it
wise
to
do.
now,
they
may
find
it
wise
to
prepare
particularly
regional
statements
rather
than
the
statement
on
a
particular
project.
incidentally,
i
think
all
the
secretary
has
said
heâ€™s
going
to
do
is
to,
is
he
thinks
prepare
a
couple
of
more
regional
statements.
i
believe
in
his
response
to
questions
put
to
him.
but
that
distinction
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
which
i
think
your
question
posed
and
suggested
and,
i
would
like
to
--
i
am
not
sure
that
these
matter
is
not
well
in
mind
from
the
questions
that
the
court
has
put.
but
looking
to
102
(2)
(c),
this
is
what
compulsory
and
all
that
is
compulsory
that
they
will
be
included
in
every
recommendation,
a
report
on
proposals
for
major
federal
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
human
environment
and
what
is
to
be
included,
the
environmental
impact
of
the
proposed
action,
any
adverse
environmental
effects
which
cannot
be
avoided
should
the
proposal
be
implemented.
alternatives
to
the
proposed
action,
any
irreversible
and
irretrievable
commitments
of
resources
which
would
be
involved
in
the
proposed
action
should
it
be
implemented.
now,
if
the
court
please
in
scrap
ii
if
i
understood
correctly,
the
tolling,
stitching,
the
court
said
that
if
we
want
to
determine
what
kind
of
an
impact
statement
is
to
be
prepared
we
must
first
define
accurately
what
the
proposed
major
federal
action
is,
and
secondly,
that
in
circumstances
such
as
exist
there
and
exist
here
where
the
proposals
where
by
private
companies
that
the
recommendation
of
the
proposal
for
major
federal
action
is
the
approval
of
those
applications
for
in
scrap
ii
in
failure
to
suspend
but
the
approval
of
those
actions.
now,
gentleman,
i
suggest
that
it
is
impossible
to
read
102
(2)
(c),
i
should
not
say
impossible
but
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
read
102
(2)
(c)
as
relating
to
something
other
than
a
specific
proposal.
the
approval
of
mining
lease,
but
how
you
can
read
this
as
saying,
that
it
covers
prior
action,
that
covers
applications
which
are
pending,
which
has
no
commitment
to
approve,
can
you
read
the
environmental
impact
of
the
proposed
action
as
saying
the
environmental
impact
of
all
prior
actions
and
all
applications
for
leases
and
for
rights
of
way,
for
mining
plants,
can
you
say
that
any
irreversible
and
irretrievable
commitment
of
resources
which
would
be
involved
in
the
proposed
action
that
you
can
read
in
to
that
all
the
actions
which
have
been
taken
in
the
way
of
leases
and
mining
plants
et
cetera
and
all
of
those
applications
which
are
pending
that
there
is
no
commitment
to
approve
which
may
or
may
not
be
approved.
i
suggest
the
court,
that
it
is
not
to
be
so
read.
now,
to
be
sure
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested
and
i
think
as
mr.
justice
stevens
suggested,
when
there
is
indeed
the
recommendation
of
a
proposal,
of
a
particular
mining
plant
for
instance,
well,
that
is
approved.
it
must
deal
with
the
situation
which
is
approved
if
this
adds
further
impact
on
the
environment
that
breaks
the
camels
back,
a
portion
you
got
to
look
at
what
the
circumstances
are
what
the
cumulative
effect
it
is,
and
if
it
is
claimed
that
impact
statements
is
inadequate,
it
can
be
claimed
that
it
is
inadequate,
because
it
does
not
give
consideration
to
the
cumulative
effects
but
may
i
say
again
that
this
does
not
mean
that
the
secretary
is
under
obligation.
he
may
do
it
because
it
is
the
wise
course,
it
is
the
most
desirable
way
of
managing
it
but
this
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
these
under
obligation
to
prepare
a
regional
impact
statement.
now,
he
would
be
under
an
obligation
of
preparing
regional
impact
statement,
if
that
constituted
if
a
plan
had
been,
if
he
had
a
plan,
which
involved
the
entire
region
that
he
was
carrying
in
effect
except
that
as
you
know
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts,
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
that
even
where
you
had
such
as
thing
as
two
phases
of
tea
tongs
(ph)
or
where
you
have
the
simply
utah
project,
if
part
authorized
by
the
congress,
if
part
of
that
has
independent
utility,
a
single
impact
statement
on
that
part
having
independent
utility
and
which
does
not
commit
you
to
go
forward
and
finish
the
entire
project,
can
be
supported
by
an
impact
statement
which
is
limited
to
that
part.
now,
therefore
i
would
submit
your
honors
and
i
did
have
the
feeling
that
this
was
brought
in
the
course
of
the
question.
then
you
have
got
to
find
a
proposal,
the
proposal
has
not
so
far
as
i
could
hear,
and
brought
your
attention
by
opposing
council
nor
by
the
court
below,
and
what
he
talked
about,
the
court
below
said
was
all
of
these
prior
approvals,
all
of
these
things
in
being,
all
of
the
applications
which
are
pending
and
the
studies
which
have
been
made,
that
these
indicate
that
interior
is
contemplating
control.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
really
fully
understand
your
question,
the
findings
of
the
district
court
is
that
there
is
no
planned
program
or
other
major
federal
action,
indeed.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
and
this
was
conceded
by
opposing
counsel.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
do
not
see
what
is
left
and
i
do
not
see
how
that
is
gotten
around.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
if
they
are
integrated,
certain.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
is
that
the
question?
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
think
that,
you
know
this
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
in
the
first
place
you
know,
there
is
a
finding
that
so
far
as
these
proposals
of
the
private
companies
are
concerned
that
they
are
not
being
constructed
or
carried
out
pursuant
to
any
integrated
plan,
and
also
that
the
plans
that
these
projects
of
the
individual
companies
are
not
integrated
or
interrelated.
now,
if
i
may
try
to
get
at
it
but,
if
i
do
not
think
i
have
been
responsive,
that
is
finding
31,
if
i
may
try
to
get
at
it
in
this
way,
if
the
court
pleases,
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
you
can
find
a
proposal,
unless
you
can
find
a
proposal,
there
is
no
basis
for
acquiring
an
impact
statement
and
the
way
they
sought
to
get
a
proposal
was
to
say
that
all
of
this
is
interrelated,
i
do
not
think
--
in
order
to
be
dependent
on
what
the
interrelation
was
the
fact
it
is
interrelated,
does
not
make
it
a
single
project.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
tests
which
have
been
made
by
the
courts
of
appeals
are
the
proper
tests.
that
is
if
you
go
forward
with
this
particular
proposal,
are
you
committed
to
something
greater
or
does
it
have
independent
utility.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
thought
what
judge
mckinnon
was
saying
was
that
there
is
no
any
kind
of
such
inter
relation
as
they
are
talking
about.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
right.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
really
not
on
90,000
square
miles
is
not
even
possible.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
oh,
but
that
is
a
very
different
manner,
that
is
a
very
different
manner.
it
might
be
that
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested
it
might
be
that
you
have
a
particular
proposal
which
if
you
carry
it
out,
you
are
committed
to
carrying
out
something
more.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that
raises
i
think
somewhat
difficult
questions.
i
would
be
dubious
about
that
because
does
that
plan
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
if
they
have
such
a
plan
with
that
to
remember,
it
is
not
just
there
must
be
a
proposal
from
major
federal
action
but
it
must
significantly
effect
the
environment.
so
that
you
would
have
to
find
not
only
that
it
was
a
proposal
for
major
federal
action
but
that
it
significantly
affected
the
environment.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
but
we
do
not
have
this,
obviously.
but
this
would
raise
--
you
know.
i
cannot
just--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
on
what?
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
what
they
say
is
all
the
actions
have
taken
place
in
the
past
and
all
of
the
pending
applications
which
may
or
may
not
be
approved
that,
this
in
our
view
accept
the
court
constitutes
major
federal
action
and
thus
it
goes
on
to
say.
thus,
i
do
not
know
how
it
follows--
.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
that
is
right.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
thus,
but
all
it
held
was
that
there
is
contemplation
that
they
contemplate
controlling.
it
is
the
next,
very
next
sentence
in
this,
justice
white.
they
contemplate
controlling
the
development
of
the
region.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
that
i
have
a
red
light.
