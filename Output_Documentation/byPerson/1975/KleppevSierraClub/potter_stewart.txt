justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
proceed
mr.
randolph.
as
was
pointed
out
in
another
case
during
the
argument
yesterday
in
the
language
of
the
102
(2)(c)
is
little
--
it
does
not
say
anything
about
filing
an
impact
statement
it
just
says,
it
shall
include
in
every
recommendation
or
report
on
proposals
for
legislation
and
other
major
federal
actions.
i
guess,
the
language
recommendation
or
report
on
proposals
for
qualifies
other
major
federal
actions
or
may
be
it
does
not
but
what
has
become,
--
my
question
is,
what
has
the
government
done
with
this
big
impact,
national
impact
statement?
it
has
filled
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
require,
that
it
had
to
be
done
with
it,
except
that
it
be
included
in
every
recommendation
or
report
on
proposals
for
legislation
or
other
major
federal
action
just
kind
of
language?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
now
a
proposal
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
report
on
proposal
for
major
federal
action.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
the
and
ought
to
be
an
or,
should
it
not?
legislation
or
major
federal
action?
justice
potter
stewart
environmentally?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
population
explosion
down
there
was
it
anticipated
and--
justice
potter
stewart
and
our
position
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
is
that
big
impact
statement
is
not
a
view,
does
that
relate
to
projects
in
wyoming?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
just
relate
to
just
one
project
as
you
have
defined
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
more
than
a
proposal?
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
know
that
the
red
light
sounds
to
be
very
brief
but,
is
it
not
correct
that
in
order
for
us
to
say
five
sub
regions
are
not
adequate
you
need
one
overall
region,
we
must
conclude
that
the
secretary
is
arbitrary
and
determining
that
five
radically,
is
not
the
stand
point?
