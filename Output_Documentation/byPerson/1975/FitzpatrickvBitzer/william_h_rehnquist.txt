justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
we
know
in
this
case
mr.
orth,
does
any
lower
court
ever
opined
on
the
question
of
whether
the
state's
violation
here
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
or
was
it
simply
a
violation
of
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
only
thing
that
district
court
ever
found
out
really
was
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
we
not
have
quite
a
different
question
if
the
underlying
offense
of
the
state
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
it
was
not?
then,
it
seems
to
me
then
you
get
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
can
not
only
provide
remedies,
but
can
really
expand
the
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
beyond
where
the
amendment's
own
language
left
them?
do
you
see
what
i
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
something
more
here.
i
mean,
are
there
violations
of
title
vii
which
would
not
be
violations
of
the
equal
protection
clause
by
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
congress
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
terms
of
federal
employment
simply
by
its
housekeeping
function,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
take
any
position
as
to
whether
the
flaw
found
in
the
state's
retirement
system
was
or
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
absence
of
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
though
ever
addressed
that
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
orth
are
you
familiar
with
our
case
of
geduldig
against
aiello,
it
was
decided
two
years
ago?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
probably
as
familiar
with
it
as
i
am
at
this
point.
do
you
think
that
congress
could
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
after
our
decision
in
geduldig
against
aiello
say
that
california
can
no
longer
have
the
kind
of
pension
or
healthcare
program
that
it
had
in
geduldig
under
its
section
5
power
and
give
anyone
who
is
deprived
of
pregnancy
benefits
under
such
a
program
and
right
of
action
against
the
state
of
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
are
the
limits
of
congressâ€™
power
then
to
go
outside
of
actual
discriminations
that
would
be
barred
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
and
enlarge
that
field
under
section
5?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
can
within
precision
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
is
said
under
section
5
that
we
think
it
is
fourteenth
amendment
right
for
every
employee
of
the
state
of
california
to
receive
a
minimum
wage
of
$10,000.00
a
year
and
any
california
employee
who
does
not
receive
that
wage
has
a
cause
of
action
of
federal
court
to
recover?
can
it
do
that
under
section
5?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
is
another
thing,
but
they
are
not
the
same,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
on
the
hypothesis
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
you
say
it
was,
but
which
certainly
it
seems
to
me
debatable
and
which
none
of
the
lower
courts
held?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
but
they
are
not
equal
protection
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
debating
that
with
you
at
all,
but
i
am
simply
suggesting
that
the
fact
it
may
be
a
demonstrable
violation
of
title
vii
does
not
make
it
necessary
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
unimplemented
by
title
vii.
look,
here
is
like
kahn
against
shevin.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
upholding
the
complaint
mr.
wallace,
you
mean
a
ruling
that
it
did
constitute
an
invidious
discrimination
under
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace
do
you
think
congress
could
now
say
that
under
the
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
california
could
not
employ
the
type
of
health
benefit
program
that
was
held
to
be
constitutional
in
geduldig?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
oregon
against
mitchell.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
kahn
against
shevin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wait
a
minute,
mr.
wallace.
you
said
the
state
failed
to
do
it,
but
under
a
title
vii
claim
there
is
no
room
for
justification.
under
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
there
is;
and
presumably
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim
has
never
really
been
tried
in
the
lower
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
all
that
clear,
he
is
being
sued
as
a
trustee,
is
not
he?
of
a
retirement
fund?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
does
not
the
retirement
fund
have
a
separate
existence
over
and
apart
from
the
state
treasury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
connecticut
were
to
have
a
turnpike
authority,
sell
public
bonds
and
trade
on
the
bond
market;
and
the
state
of
connecticut
would
pledge
its
full
faith
and
credit
behind
those
bonds.
does
that
mean
that
the
connecticut
turnpike
authority,
if
otherwise
suable,
could
claim
the
eleventh
amendment
as
a
defense
if
it
were
sued
by
a
private
citizen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
us
substitute
the
development
authority
for
the
turnpike
authority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
number
75-251
and
75-283,
fitzpatrick
against
bitzer
and
bitzer
against
mathews.
these
cases
are
here
because
we
granted
cross
petitions
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
cases
arose
out
of
a
complaint
on
behalf
of
retired
male
employees
of
the
state
of
connecticut
who
asserted
that,
that
state's
statutory
retirement
benefit
plan
discriminated
against
men.
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut
concluded
that
the
plan
did
violate
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
that
since
after
1972,
state
and
local
governments
were
subject
to
the
provisions
of
that
title.
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
prospective
relief
against
the
named
state
officials.
the
district
court,
however,
denied
plaintiff's
request
for
retroactive
benefits
and
for
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
court
agreed
with
a
district
court
that
the
plaintiff's
action
insofar
as
it
sought
retroactive
benefits
was
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
because
of
our
decision
in
edalman
against
george.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
attorney's
fees,
however,
since
in
it's
view
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
would
only
have
that
sort
of
an
ancillary
effect
on
the
state
treasury
of
the
kind
which
was
permitted
under
edalman.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
retroactive
benefits
and
affirm
it's
judgment
insofar
as
it
authorized
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
analysis
in
this
case
begins
in
our
view
where
the
brad
and
edalman
ended,
since
in
edalman,
we
concluded
that
there
was
no
congressional
authorization
to
sue
the
state
as
a
party
defendant
in
the
federal
courts.
here
on
the
contrary,
congress
clearly
did
authorize
such
actions
when
it
amended
title
7
in
1972
to
bring
state
and
local
governments
within
the
purview
of
that
title.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
in
part
on
commerce
clause
cases
from
this
court
which
we
find
not
to
be
controlling.
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
its
terms
imposes
substantive
limitations
on
the
authority
of
the
states
and
section
5
of
that
amendment
provides
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation,
the
provisions
of
this
article.
we
conclude
that
congress
in
exercising
its
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
have
properly
authorized
recovery
by
the
victims
of
discrimination,
prohibited
in
title
7
against
the
state
treasury
of
connecticut.
under
the
view
we
take,
since
congress
in
title
7
authorized
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
successful
plaintiffs,
that
portion
of
the
judgment
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
attorney's
fees
might
be
awarded
in
this
case
was
correct.
the
judgment
number
75-251
is
reversed,
the
judgment
75-283
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
