justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
should
have
been
evaluated
by
the
state
after
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
according
to
your
theory,
it
has
not
even
been
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
the
appendix
does
not
have
those
documents
reproduced,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
any
difference,
it
would
be
in
the
other
direction,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed,
mr.
wallace,
i
did
not
quite
apprehend
your
answer
to
my
brother
rehnquist's
inquiry
about
kahn
against
shevin.
justice
potter
stewart
that
gave
a
tax
benefit
to
women.
i
think
it
was
in
florida
to
widows
vis-à-vis
widowers.
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
could
be
a
violation
of
title
vii
and
vice
versa.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
the
fair
amount
of
treasury
when
the
state
is
the
plaintiff
and
loses,
are
not
you?
for
conventional
costs.
i
am
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
what
i
am
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
was
your
point.
i
thought
you
said
that
is
what
the
edelman
case
held.
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
my
brother
marshal’s
question
given
to
you.
