mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
complainants
in
this
case
are
present
and
former
male
employees
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
it
was
noted
yesterday
that
the
complaint
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix,
but
it
is
well
summarized
by
the
district
court
in
the
district
court
opinion,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
cross-petition,
state's
petition
in
this
case,
the
petition
in
75-283;
and
the
complaint
is
summarized
there
at
pages
6-a
and
especially
7-a.
in
essence,
what
the
complaint
was,
it
was
an
allegation
that
if
these
complainants
had
been
females
identically
situated,
they
would
be
enabled
to
retire
earlier,
or
they
would
receive
larger
retirement
benefits
than
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
state
law.
which,
in
our
view,
presents
a
classic
case
of
discrimination,
an
allegation
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
and
on
no
other
basis.
and
fully
comparable,
for
example,
to
the
complaint
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
preceding
case
argued
yesterday,
a
complaint
that
if
i
were
a
member
of
a
different
race,
i
would
not
have
been
fired.
and
this
complaint
was
upheld
by
the
district
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
state's
petition,
the
petition
75-283.
and
it
is
summarized
on
pages
6-a
and
7-a.
in
upholding
the
complaint,
the
district
court
specifically
found
on
page
12-a,
with
respect
to
the
portions
of
the
complaint
that
are
particularly
pertinent
to
the
claim
for
back
payments,
the
sort
of
disparity
that
existed
under
the
state
law,
and
i
will
refer
very
briefly
to
this.
the
plaintiff
matthews
is
now
entitled
to
a
monthly
retirement
payment
of
$923.10,
whereas
an
identically
situated
female
employee's
benefits
would
be
$935.63.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
title
vii
that
it
constituted
a
violation
of
title
vii.
and
the
plaintiff
covert
is
getting
a
monthly
benefit
of
$305.74,
where
an
identically
situated
female
would
get
$328.66.
this,
incidentally,
is
the
only
indication
before
us
of
the
magnitude
of
the
back
payments
that
would
be
involved.
the
difference
between
those
monthly
payments
for
a
period
going
back
certainly
no
further
than
the
effective
date
of
the
1972
amendments,
if
that
far.
now,
this
type
of
complaint
seems
to
us
to
be
very
dissimilar
to
the
situation
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
case
adverted
to
yesterday,
geduldig
against
aiello
in
417
u.s.
at
page
484.
there,
both
males
and
females
had
identical
coverage
for
the
disabilities
that
were
covered
by
the
insurance
program,
and
the
case
presented
the
more
complex
question
of
whether
the
failure
to
include
pregnancy
among
the
disabilities
covered,
constituted
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
and
in
holding
that
it
did
not,
the
court
pointed
out,
in
footnote
20
of
that
opinion,
the
dissenting
opinion
to
the
contrary,
this
case
is
thus
a
far
cry
from
cases
like
reed
v.
reed
and
frontiero
v.
richardson,
involving
discrimination
based
upon
gender
as
such.
the
california
insurance
program
does
not
exclude
anyone
from
benefit
eligibility
because
of
gender,
but
merely
removes
one
physical
condition,
pregnancy,
from
the
list
of
compensable
disabilities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
possibly
so,
but
that
would
present
a
katzenbach
v.
morgan
type
of
question,
which
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
or
oregon
against
mitchell
which,
in
my
view,
is
not
what
is
involved
here,
because
in
order
for
geduldig
to
be
comparable
to
this
case,
you
would
have
had
to
have
a
situation
in
geduldig
in
which
men
and
women
were
paid
differently
for
appendicitis,
even
though
they
were,
in
all
respects,
identically
situated
with
respect
to
the
contributions
they
had
made
to
the
retirement
program.
and
the
cases
adverted
to
in
that
footnote
20
seem
to
me
to
be
the
comparable
cases
here.
the
complaint
and
the
finding
here
fully
fit
the
test
which
this
court
set
forth
in
reed
against
reed,
by
providing
dissimilar
treatment
for
men
and
women
who
are
thus
similarly
situated.
the
challenged
section
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
kahn
against
shevin
was
a
different
situation.
but
the
case
that
seems
to
me
most
closely
in
point
is
frontiero
against
richardson,
the
next
case
i
was
about
to
advert
to,
in
which
the
issue
was
a
difference
in
the
payment
of
dependency
compensation,
a
fringe
benefit
very
comparable
to
retirement
compensation.
and
in
that
case,
while
there
was
some
disagreement
expressed
about
whether
it
was
an
appropriate
occasion
for
deciding
whether
sex
is
a
suspect
classification
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
eight
members
of
the
court
agreed
that
the
disparity
in
the
payment
of
the
fringe
benefit
compensation,
solely
on
the
basis
of
gender,
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
concept
inherent
in
the
fifth
amendment's
due
process
clause.
and
while
that
was,
of
course,
a
federal
case,
i
see
no
basis
for
believing
that
that
concept
of
equal
protection
is
broader
than
the
explicit
guarantee
of
equal
protection
as
well
as
due
process
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
constitution.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
at
least
a
prima
facie
case
of
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
been
shown
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
recall
the
facts
of
that
case
offhand.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
there
were
distinctions
drawn
there
on
the
basis
of
justifications
put
forward
by
the
state,
which
the
state
here
failed
to
do.
that
was
the
point
i
was
about
to
make.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
not
been
tried,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
and
i
am
looking
at
page
30-a
of
the
same
appendix,
the
defendants,
the
state
here,
did
not
appeal
from
the
court's
determination
that
the
retirement
act
violates
title
vii,
nor
from
the
injunction
against
future
payments
from
the
retirement
fund
or
from
other
state
moneys
under
the
retirement
system
in
a
manner
which
would
discriminate
against
man
on
the
basis
of
sex.
now,
that
it
was
open
to
the
state
to
argue
that
the
act,
as
applied,
was
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
there
the
disparity
in
payments
was
justifiable
and
not
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
the
katzenbach
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
but
it
was
open
to
the
state
to
argue
that
congress
exceeded
its
powers
under
title
vii,
that
it
was
an
improper
application
of
katzenbach
against
morgan,
that
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
violated,
that
congress
could
not
reach
this
under
the
commerce
power,
an
argument
similar
to
that
made
in
national
league
of
cities.
the
state
made
none
of
these
arguments,
it
is
left
standing
here,
a
prima
facie
showing
of
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
well
as
of
title
vii.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
this
procedural
posture,
the
state
has
chosen
to
argue
merely
that
congress
is
without
the
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
enforce,
through
a
back
pay
remedy,
the
provisions
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment;
a
prima
facie
violation
of
section
1,
since
the
state
has
given
us
no
basis
to
question
that
prima
facie
showing
in
this
case.
so
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
on
the
basis
of
the
state's
contentions,
the
case
can
be
entirely
answered
as
we
have
attempted
to
answer
it
in
our
brief,
by
reliance
on
the
power
of
congress
to
afford
a
remedy
of
this
sort
under
the
power
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
conferred
upon
it
by
section
5.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
the
answer
would
be
the
same.
so
long
as
congress
was
within
its
powers
under
section
5
to
prohibit
the
substantive
conduct
as
a
violation
of
equal
protection
as
interpreted
under
the
statute;
then,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
issue
really
is
the
same
whether
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
believe
you
would
not,
since
congress
was
purporting
to
act
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
1972
amendments,
which
extended
section
vii
to
the
states.
there
is
always
the
alternative
theory
that
it
was
exercising
the
commerce
power,
but
congress
believed
that
it
really
had
more
direct
authority
to
act
against
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
decide,
even
whether
it
was
a
prima
facie
showing
of
the
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
the
case
can
be
answered
entirely
by
reliance
on
the
congressional
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
without
facing
the
very
complex
and
difficult
question
that
this
court
has
never
answered,
about
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
or
non-constitutional
concepts
of
sovereign
immunity
prevent
congress
from
conferring
a
remedy
against
a
state
by
citizens
of
that
state,
not
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
issue
has
been
addressed
in
some
penetrating
historical
analysis
in
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
75-251
by
a
group
of
civil
rights
organizations,
and
i
commend
that
to
the
court's
attention,
if
any
of
the
justices
feel
i
need
to
comment
on
that
question.
and
i
should
add
that
two
very
interesting,
very
recently
published
law
review
articles
on
this
subject,
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
should
be
called
to
the
court's
attention.
one
is
in
the
december
1975
issue
of
columbia
law
review
by
john
e.
nowak,
called
the
scope
of
congressional
power
to
create
causes
of
action
against
state
governments
in
the
history
of
the
eleventh
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and
this
one
does
include
some
historical
analysis
of
the
power
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which
incidentally
is
supportive
of
our
position.
and
the
other
recent
publication
is
in
the
february
1976
harvard
law
review,
an
article
by
lawrence
h.
tribe,
called
intergovernmental
immunities
in
litigation,
taxation
and
regulation;
separation
of
powers
issues
in
controversies
about
federalism.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
recent
ones.
both
of
these
articles,
as
well
as
the
amicus
brief,
advocate
a
historical
analysis
which
is
essentially
similar
to
the
historical
analysis
set
forth
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
missouri
employees
case.
and
that
issue
will,
of
course,
be
before
the
court
soon
enough,
undoubtedly,
because
the
1974
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
did
explicitly
include
an
authorization
of
the
kind
of
suit
by
employees
against
state
and
local
government
employers,
that
the
court
held
in
the
missouri
case
was
not
authorized,
but
we
see
no
need
to
reach
it
here.
thank
you.
