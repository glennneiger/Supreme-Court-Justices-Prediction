mr.
sidney
d.
giber
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
my
brother,
paul
orth,
made
reference
to
the
fact
that,
as
he
expressed
it,
that
there
was
a
two-year
inexplicable
delay
by
the
state
to
act.
what
he
was
referring
to
is
that
at
the
approximate
time
the
plaintiffs
instituted
their
action.
the
sponsor,
or
one
of
the
sponsors
of
this
case,
the
connecticut
state
employees
association,
others
sought
to
have
the
state
retirement
act
amended.
it
was
not
amended
at
that
session
or
the
following
one.
i
had
--
let
us
say,
as
an
assistant
attorney
general
i
have
no,
shall
we
say,
cause
to
appear
before
the
legislature
to
advocate
passage
of
bills.
i
believe
that
the
state
retirement
commission
presented
the
bill,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
can
not
blame
the
state
or
say
that
the
state
is
acting
in
somewhat
bad
faith
when
the
legislature
fails
to
pass
a
bill.
that
perhaps,
among
other
things,
we
may
say
that
those
that
were
advocating
the
passage
of
the
bill
did
not
advocate
it
well,
perhaps
they
were
not
doing
their
jobs
as
lobbyists
well.
however,
the
mere
fact
that
the
legislature
had
the
bill
before
it,
or
had
a
bill
before
it,
does
not
constitute
an
action
of
bad
faith.
among
the
other
things
that
mr.
orth
said
yesterday
was
that
the
plaintiff
--
that
the
state
should
have
promptly
re-evaluated
its
employment
practices
upon
the
passage
of
the
amendment
of
title
vii
in
1972.
the
illusions
being
that,
i
guess
in
the
various
briefs,
that
the
state
will
do
nothing
until
it
is
forced
to
do
so
by
a
federal
court.
again,
they
do
not
take
the
practicalities
of
state
government
into
existence.
for
example,
let
us
say,
at
this
approximate
time,
when
they
are
saying
that
we
were
acting
in
bad
faith,
among
other
things
that
were
going
on
is,
for
example,
the
state
police
department
was
trying
to
remove
the
minimum
height
requirements
from
its
requirements
for
becoming
a
state
trooper.
and
we
were
opposed
by
the
same
organization
that
is
sponsoring
this
action,
and
we
had
to
go
all
the
way
to
the
state
supreme
court
before
we
could
accomplish
a
civil
libertarian
type
of
thing,
such
as
removing
the
minimum
educational
and
the
minimum
height
requirements
from
the
state
police
requirements.
we
feel
that
the
awarding
of
attorneys'
fees
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
understand
that
the
courts
may
issue
injunctions
against
state
officers.
but
we
also
believe
that
in
the
process,
the
federal
court
should
not
--
may
not
impose
a
monetary
award
against
the
state,
against
the
state's
own
consent.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
well,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
already
taken
care
of
costs;
but
i
do
not
believe
that
cost
includes
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
i
do
not
believe
that.
i
think
that
the
only
time
when
you
could
really
apply
costs
against
the
state
is,
let
us
say,
where
the
state
was
the
plaintiff
and
the
state
then
loses.
i
think
that
perhaps
should
be
the
time
when
the
state
would
pay
costs.
otherwise,
we
are
reaching
into
the
state
treasury
again.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
the
$20
shares,
the
entry
costs
and
so
forth.
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
already
said
that
costs
were
--
could
be
assessed
against
the
state,
and
i
am
trying
to
differentiate
and
to
say
that
the
costs
should
not
include
attorneys'
fees.
i
believe
that,
for
example,
in
edelman,
that
the
ancillary
object
would
be,
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
order
was
issued
against
the
chairman
of
the
state
retirement
commission,
telling
him
to
no
longer
pay
in
this
discriminatory
fashion,
and
that
it
was
incidental
to
the
order
that
it
requires
payments
from
the
state
treasury.
however,
because
it
is
a
future
payment,
and
something
that
the
legislature
can
make
provision
for,
it
is
something
that
can
be
handled.
it
is
when
we
get
things
such
as
back
pay
that
--
let
us
say,
the
state
cannot
very
well
handle
it,
or
cannot
in
a
practical
fashion
handle
it.
in
a
small
state
such
as
connecticut,
where
everything
is,
let
us
say,
so
tiny,
for
example,
in
our
little
office.
i
am
in
a
unit
of
men
that
represents
85
state
agencies,
and
we
get
an
overall
view
of
the
state
government,
and
we
see
that
the
difficulties
that
state
agencies
face
in
producing
money
at
times
that
they
need
it.
in
other
words,
there
comes
a
time
in
this
past
year
the
state
police
department
had
to
make
the
decision
that
it
could
not
purchase
a
certain
number
of
new
cruisers,
that
it
would
have
to
make
do
with
the
older
cruisers,
because
the
money
simply
was
not
there.
mr.
orth
suggested
yesterday
that
perhaps
a
remedy
would
be
to
provide
for
installment
plans,
or
for
payments
to
be
made
in
the
future.
i
think
that
chief
judge
clarie,
in
the
district
court
opinion,
very
wisely
said
he
was
going
to
leave
the
remedies
to
the
legislature,
and
that
he
would
not
attempt
to
enter
into
the
field
in
which
the
legislature
had
acted.
we
have
the
delicate
questions
of
individual
officers
of
the
state
who
are
being
sued
for
damages
and
whether
or
not
those
should
be
paid
by
the
state.
for
example,
we
have
a
statute
in
connecticut
that
says,
in
effect,
that
no
state
officer
or
employee
will
be
personally
liable
for
his
actions
unless
willful
or
wanton.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
obvious
that
if
action
were
brought
against
one
of
the
commissioners
and
his
action
were
not
willful
or
wanton,
the
payment
would
be
coming
from
the
state
treasury,
and
obviously
such
an
action
would
be
indeed
an
action
against
the
state.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes,
sir,
it
does,
but
it
requires
money
from
the
state
treasury
in
order
to
operate.
for
example,
at
the
present
moment,
the
state
has
agreed
to
pay
additional
funds
in
over
a
period
of
40
years
in
order
to
make
the
fund
actuarially
sound.
and
for
several
years
in
the
past,
the
money
that
the
state
has
been
compelled
to
pay
in
has
not
been
large
enough
to
keep
the
fund
actuarially
sound.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
i
am
trying
to
compare
that.
it
happens
that
one
of
my
client
agencies
is
the
connecticut
development
authority
and
does
issue
bonds.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
so
that
i
--
into
that
area
in
there.
i
think
that
once
the
state
guarantees
the
bonds,
that
perhaps
we
come
to
a
conclusion
that
this
is
not
really
a
separate
authority.
that
this
is
some
sort
of
a
conglomerate
existence.
for
example,
the
connecticut
development
authority
has
a
curious
statute
which
says
that,
the
statute
speaks
of
the
department
of
commerce,
and
then
it
says,
there
is
created
within
the
department
of
commerce
a
connecticut
development
authority.
so
very
clearly,
inside
the
department
of
commerce,
we
have
an
authority.
yet,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
authority
is
part
of
a
state
agency.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
well,
of
course,
let
us
say,
the
state,
in
its
statute,
has
guaranteed
that
it
would
not
change
the
statutes
during
the
terms
of
the
bond.
so
that
they
have
made
guarantees
that
are
satisfactory
to
the
bond
purchasers.
that
the
state
actually
stands
behind
them.
but
we
do
have
a
rather
curious
situation
going
on
with
this
authority,
and
it
bothers
me
at
almost
every
session.
i
believe
that
state
governments
need
sovereign
immunity
and
the
eleventh
amendment
for
very
practical
reasons.
and
that
is,
in
order
to
be
able
to
handle
our
physical
existence,
the
state
must
be
in
a
position
to
decide
when
it
is
waiving
sovereign
immunity.
for
example,
the
state
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
in
automobile
accident
cases.
the
statute
says
that
when
the
automobile
is
owned
by
the
state
of
connecticut
and
insured
by
the
state,
you
may
bring
an
action
directly.
so
that
where
we
get
time
to
get
ourselves
set
to
handle
the
problem,
then
we
may
safely
look
to
the
future
and,
let
us
say,
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
those
cases.
for
example,
we
have
waived
sovereign
immunity
as
concerns
certain
aspects
of
the
state
department
of
health,
and
the
statute
says
that
damages
may
be
paid
out
of
the
general
fund.
so
that
again
there
is
a
way
of
paying
once,
let
us
say,
the
state
has
been
found
liable.
but,
unless
there
is
a
way
of
paying,
and
somebody
says,
you
must
pay
money
or
court
says
to
the
retirement
authority,
to
the
retirement
commission
or
to
the
department
of
commerce.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes,
sir,
that
is
a
retrospective
effect,
and
it
has
been
something
that
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
well,
let
us
say,
under
my
theory,
it
is
discriminatory,
but
i
say
that
no
back
pay,
because
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
that
is
correct.
but,
from
this
day
forward
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
my
reason
is
that,
again
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
let
us
say,
we
have
to
have
--
we
can
get
ourselves
set
for
the
future;
but
we
cannot
handle
liability
for
the
past.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
what
was
that,
sir?
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
well,
i
believe
that
they
both
have
their
place
and
their
existence
in
--
we
say
in
statutory
construction,
when
you
have
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes
sir.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes,
sir.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
we
then
have
the
power
to,
let
us
say,
make
appropriations
for
it.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
no,
sir.
that
is
i
believe
twisting
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
the
edelman
case
holds
that
you
can
order
payments
in
the
future.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
but,
the
only
way
we
can
handle
payments
in
the
future
is
the
fact
that
we
have
in
the
future
the
power
to
tax
and
the
power
to
make
appropriations.
now,
when
you
begin
giving
us
retrospective
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
granted
that
that
is
--
that
we
will
be
paying
the
back
pay
in
the
future.
but
you
are
giving
us,
let
us
say,
untold
--
let
us
say,
a
possibility
of
tremendous
liability
that
perhaps
cannot
be
handled.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
let
me
express
it
this
way
that
where
the
state
has
not
acted.
it
does
not
have
the
ability
to
produce
the
funds
for
so
acting,
and
that
the
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
for
back
payments?
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
well,
i
think
it
presents
great
difficulty.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
yes,
sir,
because
it
requires
extra
funds.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
sir,
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
$20
a
piece.
we
do
not
know
what
the
total
amount
is
in
this
one,
i
did
attempt
to
--
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
i
believe
that
the
principle
is
the
same
though,
be
it
$1
or
$1
million
or
$1
billion.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
no.
i
say
that
this
court
does
not
have
the
authority
to
force
the
state
legislature
to
raise
it.
you
can
issue
an
order
to
tell
me
to
do
something
in
the
future,
and
as
an
incidental
of
that
order,
and
only
as
an
incidental
of
that
order,
can
it
have
a
monetary
effect.
mr.
sidney
d.
giber
i
believe
that
the
only
way
open
to
this
court
is
to
issue
an
order
to
the
state
official,
compelling
him
to
comply
or
to
do
his
duty
in
a
constitutional
sense,
and
that
if,
as
an
incident
of
that,
it
requires
that
money
be
paid,
then
it
can
be
--
it
must
be
done
in
that
fashion.
i
believe
that
the
ancillary
aspects
are
really
only
very
incidental,
and
that
the
intent
of
the
order
of
the
court
should
not
be
to
compel
the
states
to
pay
money,
but
the
intent
of
the
order
of
the
court
should
be
to
compel
the
official
to
do
his
duty.
charles
alan
wright
wrote
in
federal
courts,
the
second
edition,
the
1970
works,
that
he
thought
that
the
court
had
decided
that
--
the
young
court
was
fully
aware
of
the
possibility
of
holding
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
altered
or
limited
the
eleventh
amendment
and
had
expressly
chosen
not
to
do
so.
and
what
mr.
wright
was
trying
to
say
is
that
each
amendment
must
live
and
be
given
its
validity
within
its
own
sphere.
we
must
try
to
have
them
both
living
at
the
same
time
and
giving
effect
to
both
of
them.
and
it
is
a
delicate
balance
that
requires
each
case
to
be
analyzed
as
we
handle
each
one.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
mere
--
let
us
say,
rewriting
of
the
doctrine
of
the
young
case
would
necessarily
be
a
great
blow
for
liberty.
i
believe
that,
among
other
things
that
could
happen,
would
be
that
corporate
giants,
such
as
in
the
great
northern
life
and
reed
case,
might
claim
gigantic
tax
windfalls.
so
that
all
is
not
that
clear.
as
to
the
other
aspects
of
attorney’s
fees
in
there,
many
of
the
cases
are,
in
effect,
handled
by
the
attorney
general’s
office
in
connecticut.
we,
for
example,
handle
all
the
cases
that
come
before
the
commission
on
human
rights
and
opportunities.
and
the
fact
that
there
are,
let
us
say
--
i
am
trying
to
compare
the
eeoc
load
to
our
load;
and
we
do
a
great
deal
of
the
civil
rights
work
ourselves
under
our
own
commission
of
human
rights
and
opportunities,
and
therefore
there
is
not
the
great
need
for,
let
us
say,
the
payment
of
attorney’s
fees
that
my
opponents
would
make
appear
necessary.
thank
you.
