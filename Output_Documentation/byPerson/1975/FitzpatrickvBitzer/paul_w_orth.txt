mr.
paul
w.
orth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
eleventh
amendment
prohibits
a
federal
court
from
awarding
back
pay
monetary
relief
against
a
state
in
favor
of
employees
of
that
state
who
established
that
they
were
victims
of
discrimination
in
violation
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
as
amended
in
1972
to
include
states.
in
other
words,
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
empower
congress
to
authorize
equitable
monetary
awards
in
private
suits
against
the
state
for
employment
discrimination?
mr.
paul
w.
orth
this
case
did
start
out
your
honor
as
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
was
amended
than
to
become
a
title
vii
case.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
i
believe
i
do
your
honor.
essentially,
of
course
title
vii
is
an
extension
into
the
employment
area
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
your
honor,
i
consider
that
the
1972
amendments
to
title
vii
as
demonstrated
clearly
in
the
legislative
history
or
passed
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
title
vii,
correctly
yes,
that
was
passed
pursuant
to
the
commerce
clause
and
that
was
so
held
in
the
cases
involving
public
accommodations,
but
--
and
there
is
of
course
reference
in
the
statute
to
industries
affecting
commerce
and
as
our
brief
indicates,
the
1972
amendments,
title
vii
anyway
and
perhaps
the
72
amendments
seemed
to
be
founded
on
both
the
commerce
clause
and
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
oh!
yes
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
as
to
the
federal
government,
i
would
imagine
that
would
have
to
be
it
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
yes,
that
is
my
understanding
your
honor,
but
here
is
an
extension
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
from
private
industry
to
cover
a
governmental
employment
and
of
course
in
this
case
particularly
employment
by
the
state
of
connecticut
which
had
a
discriminatory
retirement
system.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
brought
originally
as
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
then
few
weeks
later,
we
filed
the
eeoc
complaint,
but
had
we
pursued
it
on
strictly
fourteenth
amendment
grounds,
that
position
would
have
been
there
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection
on
the
face
of
connecticut’s
retirement
laws?
mr.
paul
w.
orth
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
became
after
the
appropriate
time
and
the
appropriate
notice
to
sue
from
the
attorney
general,
this
became
a
title
vii
case
and
we
won
the
title
vii
case
and
the
state
did
not
appeal
and
it
was
in
effect
established
by
the
district
court
in
connecticut
that
connecticut’s
retirement
laws
did
discriminate
against
men.
in
other
words,
the
men
did
not
get
the
benefits
and
they
could
not
retire
at
the
same
age
as
women
and
that
this
not
only
of
course
violated
title
vii,
but
seem
to
violate
the
eeoc
guidelines
which
were
promulgated
about
two
weeks
after
the
1972
amendments
and
i
think
someone
important
to
establish
a
bit
of
the
chronology
here,
these
of
course
were
laws
of
the
state
of
connecticut
which
presumably
should
have
been
reevaluated
by
the
state
after
the
passage
of
the
1972
amendments.
this
did
not
--
mr.
paul
w.
orth
this
would
be
so
true,
your
honor,
but
nobody
had
tested
the
question
out.
what
i
am
getting
at
though
is
that
about
nine
months
after
the
law
was
changed,
my
clients
are
representatives
of
a
class
of
active
and
retired
male
state
employees
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
court
and
also
filed
the
eeoc
complaint
later
amended.
now,
the
--
mr.
paul
w.
orth
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
those
are
however
in
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
are
part
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
not
in
the
appendix,
no.
basically
there
is
no
factual
dispute
anymore
and
that
i
think
is
the
reason
for
that.
the
state
of
connecticut
in
effect
spent
two
wasted
years
in
terms
of
legislative
action
in
which
it
did
nothing
to
correct
the
discrimination
that
was
apparent
on
the
face
of
its
laws
and
in
october
of
1974,
excuse,
september
of
1974,
the
distinct
court
enjoined
the
state
officials
who
were
sued
from
continuing
to
administer
the
law
in
a
fashion
discriminatory
against
men.
the
problem
of
course
and
the
reason
why
we
are
here
is
in
the
process,
the
court
relying
on
the
eleventh
amendment
in
edelman
and
jordan
denied
a
recalculation
of
retroactive
retirement
benefits
which
i
am
for
shorthand
referring
to
as
back
pay
and
also
denied
attorney’s
fees
and
in
that
of
course,
we
submit
there
is
error
in
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
as
to
attorney’s
fees
only
and
i
will
be
addressing
most
of
my
argument
to
the
back
pay
question.
i
have
i
believe
already
mentioned
that
the
'72
amendments
were
adapted
after
extensive
legislative
hearings.
there
was
a
considerable
background
of
discrimination
in
governmental
employment,
perhaps
worst
than
in
the
private
sector.
there
seems
to
be
no
question
in
language
plus
the
intent
of
congress
that
congress
intended
to
make
a
state
employer
subject
to
the
same
obligations
as
private
employers
and
give
state
employees
access
to
all
the
remedies
under
title
vii
that
an
employee
of
private
industry
would
have.
now,
the
effective
nullification
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below
of
the
monetary
remedial
provisions
of
title
vii
in
the
state
context
to
me
cannot
be
squared
with
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
foremost
is
the
albemarle
versus
moody
case
about
a
year
ago
and
then
less
than
a
month
ago
the
case
of
franks
versus
bowman.
these
cases
demonstrate
in
various
forms,
two
forms
primarily,
first
back
pay
and
then
seniority,
the
importance
to
the
enforcement
of
title
vii
of
the
private
remedy
of
back
pay
of
seniority
and
that
these
remedies
are
part
of
a
complex
equitable
remedy.
there
is
no
cut
off
point
in
the
remedial
section
of
title
vii
between
monetary
damages
or
cause
of
action
from
monetary
damages
on
the
one
hand
and
an
injunction
which
was
obtained
here
on
the
other.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
albemarle
case
indicated
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
open
up
any
chasm
between
the
injunctive
and
the
monetary
aspects.
now,
having
said
that
in
the
private
context
and
congress
having
found
that
discrimination
in
governmental
employment
was
perhaps
more
institutionalized,
worse
than
in
private
employment.
it
seems
that
if
the
range
of
the
equitable
remedies
available
against
states
are
cut
down,
that
private
suits
to
enforce
state
employees
rights
are
likely
to
disappear.
it
is
certainly
apparent
and
it
was
congress’
intent
that
private
suits
would
be
a
prime
means
of
enforcing
the
law
and
that
the
resources
of
the
attorney
general
were
insufficient
to
take
care
of
all
these
cases.
furthermore,
it
was
apparent
that
congress
was
relying
as
has
had
to
be
the
case
in
the
civil
rights
area
for
a
century,
on
the
federal
courts
and
it
gave
the
federal
courts
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
yet
the
court
below
suggested
that
congress
could
and
both
of
this
areas
have
done
things
differently.
in
other
words,
that
reliance
could
have
been
had
on
the
attorney
general
alone
or
that
state
courts
might
be
available.
in
stressing,
as
both
albemarle
and
the
franks
cases
have
the
equitable
remedy,
a
remedy
that
is
not
like
damages,
not
subject
to
jury
trial,
that
is
part
of
a
complex
to
try
to
solve
on
a
case
by
case
basis
as
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
seems
fit.
the
congress
has
in
effect
solved
a
problem
of
federalism
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
doing
so,
a
couple
of
things
have
been
accomplished,
they
are
quite
vital.
first
of
all,
it
is
perhaps
most
appropriate
that
in
this
very
difficult
area
of
federalism,
federal
concern
that
congress
made
up
of
the
representatives
of
the
various
states
is
the
most
appropriate
forum
to
determine
what
remedy
rights
and
remedies
there
should
be
and
of
course
here,
congress
has
spoken
very
clearly
and
in
speaking
very
clearly
and
in
giving
the
district
courts
these
full
equitable
powers
not
only
to
issue
the
injunction,
but
to
order
other
affirmative
relief
etc.
as
the
recent
decisions
have
pointed
out,
the
congress
i
submit
has
allowed
the
lower
court
to
take
into
account
one
factor
that
might
be
inappropriate
concern
in
the
difficult
federal
equation
in
modern
times
and
that
is
this.
that
if
in
a
particular
case,
the
impact
on
the
federal
treasury
is
too
severe,
it
is
perhaps
something
that
could
be
taken
into
account
by
the
court
to
allow
payment
over
a
period
of
time,
not
award
full
back
pay,
do
something
other
than
might
be
done
in
the
private
sector
and
just
what
would
be
done
--
mr.
paul
w.
orth
yes,
your
honor,
somewhat;
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
pregnancy.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
i
would
believe
so
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
well,
the
limits
your
honor
are
very
hard
to
state
with
any
precision,
but
what
i
think
--
mr.
paul
w.
orth
but
i
think
what
i
would
mean
to
state
is
that
congress
cannot
in
effect
impair
the
effectiveness
of
the
administration
of
the
state
government
severely
impact
upon
the
state
treasury
and
various
things
that
would
substantially
destroy
the
states
and
impinge
perhaps
on
the
tenth
amendment
areas
of
reserved
rights
to
the
states.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
well,
can
it
do
it
under
the
commerce
clause
is
i
think
one
of
the
--
mr.
paul
w.
orth
they
are
not
the
same.
i
would
like
to
think
that
congress
can
go
further
under
section
5
and
under
the
commerce
clause,
particularly
your
honor
if
we
are
not
talking
minimum
wages,
but
something
much
more
fundamental
which
is
what
we
are
talking
there.
we
are
talking
equal
protection
which
happens
to
be
by
statute
in
the
context
of
equal
opportunity,
equal
protection
in
employment.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
excuse
me,
your
honor,
there
are
cited
in
the
lower
courts'
decision,
perhaps
i
was
not
clear
on
this
before,
there
are
several
cases
indicating
that
retirement
plans
are
violations
of
title
vii.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
but
they
are
not
fourteenth
amendment
cases,
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
well,
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
that
aspect
is
not
debatable.
really
the
fringe
benefits
are
part
of
title
vii.
the
guidelines
are
clear
enough.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
i
will
accept
that
your
honor.
nevertheless
here,
congress
acting
with
an
abundance
of
evidence
in
effect
has
implemented
equal
protection
rights
which
needed
protecting
and
what
is
happening
here
and
what
can
happen
here
and
what
i
suggest
did
happen
here
is
the
state
of
connecticut
and
you
cannot
point
to
one
individual
official
and
charge
bad
faith
on
one
official.
but
for
over
two
years,
the
state
of
connecticut
did
nothing
about
correcting
this
discrimination
until
a
lower
district
court
acted
and
then
the
state
of
connecticut
did
not
appeal.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
state
felt
it
had
a
strong
legal
position,
it
would
have
done
what
the
purpose
of
title
vii,
the
intent
of
congress
and
what
i
believe
the
recent
cases
of
the
court
state,
it
would
be
promptly
have
in
view
of
the
complaint
filed
by
the
plaintiff’s,
the
petitioners
here,
it
would
have
promptly
re-evaluated
this
aspect
of
its
employment
practices
and
done
something
about
it
or
at
least
in
view
of
the
situation
created
by
the
edelman
decision
as
read
by
some
courts,
we
have
the
danger
that
a
state
faced
with
this
sort
of
complaint
will
simply
do
nothing
about
it
until
a
federal
court
is
forced
to
act.
had
the
state
of
connecticut
acted
with
any
promptness
here
we
would
not
be
here.
our
prime
suit
was
to
get
this
practice
stopped.
the
back
pay
came
in
almost
incidentally
because
the
matter
went
on
for
so
long
after
the
institution
of
the
complaint
and
i
would
submit
unnecessarily
so.
now,
the
edelman
decision
which
i
just
referred
to
is
one
i
would
submit
is
not
applicable
because
it
did
not
concern
itself
with
eleventh
amendment.
it
did
not
have
the
situation
which
is
so
important
in
this
case
that
congress
specifically
included
states
in
the
legislative
pattern
and
in
doing
that,
i
think
there
was
a
recognition
that
this
sort
of
problem
is
a
problem
that
congress
can
most
appropriately
decide
and
then
congress
took
the
next
step
and
said
well
of
course
we
can
only
decide
on
a
broad
basis,
we
will
have
to
leave
it
as
it
has
always
been
the
case
in
discrimination
situation
for
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court
in
the
particular
situation
to
fashion
the
appropriate
relief
which
is
of
course
an
injunction
and
other
relief.
well
now
that
relief
just
does
not
appear
by
magic
on
the
date
of
an
injunctive
decree.
a
lot
of
hard
work,
a
lot
of
needed
incentive,
this
is
totally
aside
from
the
deterrence
upon
the
employer
has
to
go
into
this
sort
of
suit
that
is
before
you
today
and
other
suits.
i
might
mention
here
of
course
that
my
clients
at
least
had
the
benefit
of
some
sponsorship
in
a
class
situation,
but
there
are
going
to
be
lots
of
cases
of
individual
employment
discrimination
where
a
person
who
believes
he
or
she
is
the
victim
of
discrimination
by
the
state
employer
is
contemplating
enforcing
that
claim,
vindicating
this
interest
that
congress
has
given
the
highest
national
priority
to
and
yet
realizes
that
here
he
or
she
has
a
difficulty,
the
eleventh
amendment
problem,
the
edelman-jordan
problem
of
possibly
not
getting
back
pay,
possibly
not
getting
attorney’s
fees.
now,
if
enough
state
employees
make
enough
noise
and
band
together,
maybe
they
will
interest
the
attorney
general,
but
if
they
do
not,
a
lot
a
valid
claims
are
going
to
go
wanting
and
the
state
employer
is
going
to
be
able
to
postpone
as
i
submit
was
the
case
here,
postpone
the
day
of
reckoning
and
this
subverts
the
purpose
of
the
1972
amendments
and
it
seems
to
me,
it
undercuts
everything
this
court
had
said
recently
in
albemarle
and
the
case
like
franks
and
bowman.
furthermore,
in
edelman
there
was
a
distinction
drawn
which
i
hope
will
not
be
applicable
to
this
situation
between
prospective
and
retrospective
relief.
i
just
touched
upon
this
by
suggesting
that
if
there
is
some
cut
off
point,
it
should
not
be
at
the
time
of
the
decree,
but
some
point
further
back
in
time
when
the
employer,
the
employer
state
has
noticed
that
something
is
amiss
and
it
should
at
that
point
reevaluate
its
laws.
essentially
here
and
i
have
tried
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
tomorrow,
essentially,
if
it
please
the
court,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
finally
face
up
to
a
question
that
has
remained
unresolved
for
some
time
and
that
is
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
pro
tanto
limit
or
abrogate
the
earlier
eleventh
amendment
in
this
vital
area
of
civil
rights
where
the
rights
being
enforced
are
incompatible
with
whatever
the
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment
seem
to
be
whether
they
are
merely
to
protect
the
state
from
ordinary
commercial
debts
or
to
somehow
preserve
the
state’s
sovereignty.
the
post
civil
war
history
was
that
great
inroads
were
made
on
that
state
sovereignty.
this
was
the
intent
of
all
the
framers
and
proponents
of
the
reconstruction
amendments
and
the
reconstruction
legislation.
and
there
was
a
vast
transformation
worked
which
gave
much
more
power
to
congress
and
congress
of
course
then
passed
some
of
it
on
most
appropriately
to
the
federal
judiciary
and
this
situation,
now
if
the
lower
court
decision
is
to
stand
is
going
to
be
in
effect
reversed.
now,
i
think
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
w.
orth
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
again,
the
eleventh
amendment
and
what
it
appears
to
embody,
sovereign
immunity,
seemed
fundamentally
to
embody
the
idea
that
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
sovereign
would
do
right.
now,
here
the
sovereign,
the
state
of
connecticut,
is
saying,
for
one
reason
or
another,
we
have
engaged
in
discriminatory
conduct,
and
yet
there
is
nothing
we
need
to
do
about
it,
as
regards
to
the
past.
i
think
the
inaction
regarding
the
failure
of
the
legislature
to
do
anything
about
this
de
jure
discrimination,
the
face
of
its
retirement
laws,
illustrates
the
principle
that
perhaps
it
is
harder
in
governmental
employment
to
get
at
and
root
out
discrimination
than
in
private
industry,
because
it
is
hard
to
point
the
finger.
and
congress
recognized
this,
and
congress
tried
to
provide,
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
an
appropriate
exercise
of
its
power;
tried
to
provide
what
is
so
vital
in
the
civil
rights
area.
and
that
is
effective
remedies.
and
these
remedies
go,
and
have
an
equitable
aspect
that
not
only
concerns
the
future,
but
you
have
to
get
to
the
future.
and
you
get
to
the
future
by
attorney’s
fees
and
back
pay.
those
are
the
methods
to
eradicate
discrimination.
and
the
method
that
congress
has
chosen,
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
does
not
impinge
unduly
upon
federalism,
as
we
know
it
in
a
society,
and
as
we
should
know
it
in
a
society
committed
to
the
elimination
of
discrimination.
the
state
is
only
saying,
for
one
reason
or
another,
we
do
not
want
to
pay
money
for
the
past.
this
is,
in
effect,
a
license
to
slow
down
on
the
anti-discrimination
crusade.
and
it
is
a
license
to
other
states
to
do
nothing,
in
effect,
when
charged
with
a
discriminatory
employment
practice
until
a
federal
court
finally
is
forced,
usually
in
a
suit
by
a
private
litigant,
to
blow
the
whistle.
we
ask
the
court
not
to
allow
that
license.
the
impact
of
the,
call
it
retroactive,
the
monetary
relief
here,
which
i
say
is
not
really
retroactive
because
it
has
a
prospective
thrust.
but
that
impact
is
relatively
minimal
in
regard
or
in
comparison
with
the
impact
of
the
change
that
took
place
in
the
retirement
practices
once
the
district
court
issued
its
injunction.
i
thank
the
court.
