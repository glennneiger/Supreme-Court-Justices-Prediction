justice
thurgood
marshall
you
object
to
the
back
pay,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
retirement
system
in
connecticut
said
that
all
negroes
shall
get
one-half
of
the
others,
and
connecticut
would
not
pay,
would
it
not,
under
your
theory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
not
get
any
back
pay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
reason
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
have
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
eleventh
amendment
overrides
the
fourteenth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
eleventh
amendment
overrides
the
fourteenth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
the
way
down
to
the
point
of
whether
you
pay
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
the
court
could
say
you
cannot
do
it
anymore
in
the
future?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
that
not
make
you
put
out
some
money,
would
that
not
make
you
put
out
money?
how
could
we
make
you
put
out
that
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
eleventh
amendment
permits
this
court
to
say
that
in
the
future
you
shall
pay
equal
money.
but
that
we
cannot
say
that
in
the
past
you
have
to
make
up
for
it.
that
is
your
point,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
grant
back
pay
then,
would
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
title
vii
gave
you
that.
they
put
you
on
notice
when
title
vii
was
passed
--
legislature,
you
could
have
gotten
the
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
allege
that
the
state
does
not
have
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
difficulty!
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
difficult
for
these
people
to
live
on
the
money
they
are
getting
too.
i
do
not
think
difficulty
helps
you.
do
you
say
that
connecticut
can
raise
this
little
bit
of
money
whether
$20
a
piece,
or
something
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
do
not
know
whether
you
can
raise
it
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
are
cases
to
equalize
the
pay
between
teachersâ€™
salaries
in
several
states,
like
maryland,
costing
the
states
around
$6
million.
and
the
federal
court
said
that
is
it,
and
maryland
said
they
could
not
find
the
$6
million,
but
they
did.
