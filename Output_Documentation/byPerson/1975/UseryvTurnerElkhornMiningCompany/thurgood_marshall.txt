justice
thurgood
marshall
these
cases
are
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
both
appeals
stand
from
a
suit
brought
by
22
coal
mine
operators
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
certain
aspects
of
the
federal
coal
mine
health
and
safety
act
of
1969,
as
amended
by
the
black
lung
benefit
act
of
1972.
under
these
acts,
the
coal
mine
operators
are
required
to
compensate
certain
miners,
and
their
survivors
for
death
or
disability
caused
by
a
disease
commonly
known
as
black
lung
disease.
this
disease
is
caused
by
the
long-term
inhalation
of
coal
dust.
it
affects
a
high
percentage
of
american
coal
miners
with
severe
and
frequently
crippling
respiratory
impairment.
because
state
programs
were
considered
inadequate
to
compensate
miners
inflicted
with
black
lung
disease,
congress
provided
for
a
federal
program
of
compensation.
the
compensation
program
is
far
too
complicated
to
meet
permitted
detail,
all
descriptions
of
its
provisions,
or
the
operator's
many
challenges
to
its
provisions.
basically,
the
operator
has
challenged
the
provisions
requiring
them
to
provide
black
lung
benefits
in
two
respects.
first,
they
claim
that
the
program
violate
the
due
process
clause
insofar,
as
it
requires
them
to
compensate
former
employees
who
terminated
their
work
in
the
coal
mine
before
the
program
was
enacted.
the
district
court
rejected
this
claim
and
for
reasons
set
forth
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
that
the
due
process
clause
poses
no
bar
to
the
aspects
of
the
program.
the
operators
also
challenged
the
constitutionality
under
the
due
process
clause
of
analogous
provisions
governing
the
determination
of
which
miners
and
survivors
are
entitled
to
receive
benefits
under
the
program.
the
district
court
found
that
two
of
these
provisions
unconstitutionally
impaired
the
operator's
ability
to
train
them
against
claims
of
black
lung
benefits.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion,
this
aspect
of
this
court's
judgment
is
affirmed
in
part,
reversed
in
part,
and
vacated
in
part.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part,
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
joined.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
