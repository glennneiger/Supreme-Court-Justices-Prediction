unknown

(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
this
is
as
only
constitutional
argument,
irrationality
of
the
means
to
achieve
this?
unknown
speaker
the
rationality
is
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
so
you,
in
fact,
argue
that
you
are
being
deprived
of
your
property
without
due
process
of
law?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
government
is
relying
on
that
other
part
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
is
saying
that
the
government
is
taking
your
property
without
adequate
compensation?
you
are
not
relying
on
that,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
being
irrational
about
it.
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
irrationality
the
proposition,
this
is
a
question
to
you,
that
it
is
irrational
to
put
all
the
liability
in
one
place
where
it
may
be
derived
from
many
places,
the
responsibility,
the
fault?
unknown
speaker
one
used
to
hear
a
video
about
silicosis
in
miners.
is
that
a
generic
term
of
which
this
is
a
specifically
included
disease
or
is
that
something
else?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
the
top
of
page
26,
you
have
a
statement
that
97%
of
these
cases
have
been
administering
reviewed
themselves?
unknown
speaker
and
only
12
have
been
reviewed
so
far
by--
unknown
speaker
well,
the
national
workman’s
compensation
could
entirely
take
care
of
this
problem,
this
is
basically
reparations,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
this
is
part
of
the
legislation.
unknown
speaker
yes
but
future,
of
course,
ordinary
conventional
workman’s
compensation
can
take
care
of
it.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
that
aspect,
are
we?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is?
unknown
speaker
apply
the
fifth
annual
thing
now
being—
unknown
speaker
97%
of
all
determinations
being
appealed?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
particular
reason,
mr.
wallace,
why
it
takes
so
long
to
try
one
of
these
administrative
reviews?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
such
a
small
number.
unknown
speaker
if
the
states
pick
this
up
as
part
of
the
state
workman’s
compensation
system,
would
amendments
of
state
laws
be
required?
unknown
speaker
and
the
states
have
simply
not
amended
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
is
this
limited
to
a
few
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
i
mean
the
current
ones,
5,000-6,000
a
year
they
would
still
be
widespread
throughout
the
--
unknown
speaker
wallace,
did
i
understand
you
say
earlier
that
you
thought
it
would
be
relatively
few
claims
made
retroactively?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
the
retroactive
basis
here?
unknown
speaker
unless
this
precedes
to
be
a
matter
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act
and
he
must
have
made
his
claim
disability
after
the
effective
date.
that
is
the
way
i
understood
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
record
in
the
brief
to
an
employee
who
quit
being
a
coalminer
in
1920.
when
does
the
statute
of
limitation
run
as
to
him
exactly,
three
years
from
the
effective
date
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
does
these
irrebuttable
presumptions
operate
against
the
man
who
comes
in
with
a
claim
20,30,40
years
old
in
his
favor?
unknown
speaker
and
there
are,
according
to
the
briefs,
already
claims
being
filed,
as
my
brother
powell
says,
by
people
who
left
the
coal
mines
in
the
20s
or
in
the
30s
or
in
the
40s
and
the
benefits
run
not
only
to
these
people
if
they
are
alive
but
also
to
their
widows
and
children,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
this
allows
x-ray
evidence
as
exclusive
reason
for
disallowing
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
he
has
to
prove
any
of
that
when
he
sues
a
particular
operator
that
at
some
time
he
worked
for
that
operator.
unknown
speaker
had
he
worked
for
some
operator,
long
since
disappeared,
that
is
the
only
one,
he
could
not
recover
from
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
before
the
court
who
is
going
to
pay
for
this.
we
would
not
even
have
a
problem
if
the
good
lord
is
going
to
pay
for
this.
if
people
were
hurt,
who
is
going
to
pay?
unknown
speaker
we
know
it
is
not
industry-wide.
it
is
not
a
charge
on
the
industry
as
a
whole.
unknown
speaker
make
it
a
claim
against
the
particular
employer
when
that
employee
proves
was
only
a
desk
clerk,
never
exposed
to
any
of
these
conditions.
then,
he
left
that
employer
and
went
to
another
employer,
worked
for
him
for
30
years
and
was
exposed,
contracted
the
disease,
could
not
recover
if
the
second
employer
is
out
of
business,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
thinking
of
examples
like
this,
does
the
act
provide
for
this
sort
of
situation,
coal
is
a
depleting
product
obviously,
you
could
have
a
mining
company
that
20-25
years
ago
may
have
had
1,000
employees.
it
may
have
gradually
depleted
its
coal
and,
today,
may
have
50-100
employees.
is
it
not
possible
that
that
miner
might
have
more
claimants
than
it
has
employees
today?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
would
protect
that
company
from
being
put
out
of
business
by
claims
as
against
which
it
has
had
no
alternative
to
set
up
reserves
or
carry
insurance?
unknown
speaker
the
proposition
for
which,
by
traditional
due
process
standards,
no
recovery
might
be
had
in
some
of
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
the
government
takes
on
the
whole
financial
burden
for
the
first
three-and-a-half
years
or
a
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
that
itself
has
had
the
effect
of
minimizing
the
responsibility
--
unknown
speaker
the
accountants
who
handle
the
work
for
these
employers
do
not
set
up
reserves
to
take
this
into
account
on
the
present.
