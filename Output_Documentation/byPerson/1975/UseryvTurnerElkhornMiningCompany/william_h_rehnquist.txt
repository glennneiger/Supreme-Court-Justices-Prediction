justice

h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcmahan,
are
you
talking
now
about
those
who
were
employed
by
a
particular
mining
operator
and
who
are
presumed
to
have
contracted
the
disease
during
the
period
of
that
employment
although
their
symptoms
showed
much
later?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
do
not
see
what
is
irrational
about
it.
certainly,
the
retired
miners
are
getting
the
money.
i
take
it
your
contention
of
irrational
intents
from
who
is
based
on
the
source
of
the
money.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
just
suggesting
different
ways
congress
might
have
treated
it.
is
it
not
our
scope
of
inquiry
extremely
narrow
here
so
that
we
would
have
to
say,
in
effect,
that
congress
just
lost
its
head
when
it
passed
the
statute
in
order
to
hold
it
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
suspect
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
coal
mine
operators
now
in
the
classification
of
racial
minorities
and
aliens?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcmahan,
what
if
congress
had
said
“because
of
the
difficult
of
distinguishing
between
all
of
these
diseases,
any
former
coal
miner
who
comes
up
with
any
sort
of
a
respiratory
disease
is
going
to
have
to
be
compensated
by
his
former
employer,”
it
might
not
be
this
coal
mine
pneumoconiosis
but
there
is
some
substantial
chance
that
it
might
be,
and
we
are
going
to
resolve
doubts
in
favor
of
the
miner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
necessarily
because
these
people,
let
us
say,
were
employed
by
the
coalminers
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
there
is
medical
evidence
that
shows
that
pneumoconiosis
does
develop
in
people
so
employed
and
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
from
other
respiratory
diseases.
now,
you
are
resolving
many
doubts
against
the
coalminers
but
i
do
not
see
how
that
makes
it
irrational.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
it
may
be
one
thing
to
put
out
a
business
just
in
the
sense
of
not
being
able
to
carry
on
your
traditional
occupation
where
another
thing
to
be
put
out
of
business
by
having
a
large
indebtedness
which
you
are
unable
to
pay
settled
on
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
true
of
a
self
insurer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
justice
stewart’s
hypothetical
and
assume
that
instead
of
being
paid
by
all
the
corporations
whose
names
begin
with
the
first
13
letters
of
the
alphabet,
it
is
to
be
paid
by
all
corporations
who
have
a
net
worth
of
$1
billion
or
more.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
barely
rational
in
the
sense
that
these
people
are
probably
better
able
to
pay
than
just
every
corporation
in
the
country.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
certainly,
if
you
wanted
to
just
impose
a
surtax,
income
tax
on
all
such
corporations
of
10%
and,
ultimately,
use
pay
out
of
the
public
treasury
from
general
funds
compensation
to
coalminers.
there
would
not
be
much
anybody
could
do
about
it.
