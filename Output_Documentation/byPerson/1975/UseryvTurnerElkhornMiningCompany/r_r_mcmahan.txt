mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
raised
by
these
cross-appeals
is
one
of
the
constitutional
rationality
of
the
means
that
congress
has
chosen
to
achieve,
clearly,
the
legitimate
purposes
of
the
black
lung
benefits
provisions
of
the
coalmine
health
and
safety
act
of
1969.
the
coalmine
health
and
safety
act,
as
counsel
for
the
government
no
doubt
will
point
out
to
you
at
much
greater
length,
was
originally
conceived
and
enacted
to
redress
some
very
real
grievances
among
mineworkers.
it
was
designed
at
its
original
conception
to
deal
with
health
and
safety
aspects
of
mining,
to
control
dust
levels,
to
prevent
accidents.
later,
toward
the
end
of
congressional
consideration
of
the
legislation,
provisions
were
inserted
for
providing
economic
relief
to
disabled
retired
coalminers,
principally
in
the
southern
united
states.
then
at
the
very
end
of
the
consideration
of
the
act,
provisions
were
inserted
to
create
a
workman’s
compensation
program,
a
fairly
elaborate
three-part
program,
third
part
of
which
would
impose
liability
on
former
and
present
employers
of
retired
and
active
coal
mine
workers
suffering
from
occupational
disease,
a
single
occupational
disease
known
as
coal
worker’s
pneumoconiosis,
a
disease
which
is
caused
by
breathing
dust.
the
disease
actually
is
a
physiological
condition
that
develops
from
breathing
dust
at
certain
levels
in
certain
concentrations
over
given
periods
of
time.
the
more
dust
that
is
breathed,
the
longer
it
is
breathed,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
the
disease
will
develop.
this
appeal
arouse
out
of
a
suit
brought
by
22
mine
operators
in
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
legislation,
the
workman’s
compensation
provisions
of
the
legislation.
the
three-judge
court
in
the
easter
district
upheld
the
major
portions
of
the
law
against
plaintiff's
attack.
plaintiffs
challenged
to
their
validity
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
court,
however,
did
strike
down
two
presumptive
provisions
that
were
included
in
the
line.
i
will
describe
those
in
greater
detail.
that
is
why
these
cases
are
before
the
court
now
on
cross-appeal.
the
act
benefits
provisions
of
the
act,
which
is
all
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
today,
create
a
three-part
program,
the
first
part
ending
in
the
end
of
june
of
1973,
under
which
former
president
of
coal
mine
employees
could
apply
for
benefits
which
will
be
paid
by
the
federal
government
through
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
administered
by
the
social
security
administration.
the
six
months
following
the
end
of
that
program,
which
will
be
referred
to
here,
frequently,
as
the
part
b
program,
involved
a
dual
administration
of
claims
for
benefits
to
be
carried
out
by
the
department
of
labor
and
hew
jointly.
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
establishing
the
benefits
of
the
diagnostic
criteria,
the
medical
criteria,
for
determining
whether
a
miner
or
former
miner
has
the
disabling
occupational
disease,
the
act
was
designed
to
cover.
claimants
filing
within
that
time
would
be
paid
by
the
government
for
six
months
and,
thereafter,
by
a
former
employer
or
present
employer
or
a
coal
mine
operator.
the
crucial
part
of
this
legislation
and
the
part
that
plaintiffs
here
consider
constitutionally
objectionable
is
part
c
of
the
act
which
imposes
upon
mine
operators
the
former
employers
of
former
miners
and
the
present
employers
of
present
miners
the
obligation
to
pay
benefits
in
connection
with
this
single
occupational
disease.
plaintiffs
maintain
that
to
the
extent
that
this
portion
of
the
act
indiscriminately
imposes
liability
for
the
claims
of
former
employers
based
upon
employment
periods
that
had
terminated
long
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
legislation,
that
it
constitutes
a
completely
irrational
means
for
achieving
what
is
admittedly
the
legitimate
purpose
of
providing
economic
relief
to
a
large
population
of
elderly,
retired,
and
ill
coal
miners
and
their
survivors.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
i
am
talking
about
all
applicants
for
benefits
payable
by
a
former
employer
whose
employment
terminated
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
law
that
imposed
this
obligation.
it
must
be
recognized
in
this
case
that
this
is
not
a
typical
workman’s
compensation
law
that
imposes
liability
in
respect
of
occupational
disease
that
develops
after
an
employment
relationship
is
terminated
when
there
has
been
a
workman’s
compensation
law
in
effect
during
the
employment
relationship.
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
a
rational
legislative
program
because
an
employer,
if
he
knows
that
the
potential
liability
is
there,
can
insure
against
it
and
then
it
does
not
make
any
difference
if
the
work-related
disability
results
following
termination
of
the
employment.
that
is
not
the
case
here,
what
this
law
has
been
what
congress
has
done,
has
lost
sight
of
the
fact,
that
in
attempting
to
accomplish
two
purposes
here
through
the
use
of
workmen's
compensation
type
law,
they
have
chosen
a
completely
irrational
means
of
delivering
relief
to
former
retired
miners.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
yes,
my
contention
and
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
accept
that
the
only
question
of
rationality
here
is
whether
the
money
actually
reaches
the
miners.
i
think
that
the
means
has
to
be
examined
more
carefully
and
we
say
that
it
is
irrational
to
single
out
former
employers
to
deliver
what
is
really
economic
relief
as
a
result
of
disability
due
to
a
disease
which
no
one
knew
existed
in
the
united
states
at
the
time
these
men
were
employed,
and
that
has
been
recognized
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
being
a
national
obligation
and
recognized
as
being
a
moral
obligation
by
the
government.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
i
think
that
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
here
is
narrow
but
not
as
narrow
as
it
would
be
in
the
case
of
more
conventional
economic
regulatory
legislation.
i
think
that
the
means
chosen
by
congress
to
deliver
relief
to
these
former
and
retired
miners
in
this
instance,
deserve
a
closer
scrutiny
because
it
involves
a
suspect
imposition
of
new
rights
and
obligations
on
transactions
and
on
basis
of
conduct,
what
closed
in
the
past.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
it
is
suspect
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
laws
that
have
that
effect
are
suspect,
not
necessarily
unconstitutional
but
worthy
of
close
examination.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
no,
certainly
not,
but
coal
mine
operators
to
the
extent
that
they
are
now
being
held
responsible
to
pay
benefits
to
former
employers
in
connection
with
exposure
in
the
production
of
a
product
in
the
past
and
the
creation
of
a
disease
that
could
not
be
anticipated
and
could
not
be
passed
on
in
a
pricing
are
carved
out
as
a
class.
i
am
not--
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
it
is
due
process
and
equal
protection.
in
this
area
they
merge,
as
the
court
well
knows,
it
is
due
process
in
the
sense
that,
our
contention
is
that
a
workmen’s
compensation
law
is
an
irrational
means
no
matter
on
what
basis
it
is
analyzed.
it
is
an
irrational
means
for
delivering
benefits
to
persons
who
were
not
in
workforce
at
the
time
that
the
law
was
passed.
it
might
well
be
irrational
means
to
impose
this
economic
burden
on
the
industry
as
a
whole.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
no,
we
also
argue
that
carving
out
former
employers
within
the
industry
as
a
class
to
bear
the
burden
and,
to
bear
the
arbitrary
consequences
of
that
burden
will
have
competitive
consequences.
it
is
an
irrational
classification
because
this
court
--
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
that
is
our
argument
as
far
as
what
would
become
to
be
known
as
the
retroactive
provisions
of
the
(inaudible).
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
yes,
that
is
implicit
in
the
whole
irrationality
argument.
we
contend
that
the
irrationality
of
the
means
chosen
is
what
deprives
us
of
our
property.
no,
there
is
no
contention
that
we
are
suffering
any
other
deprivation
for
lack
of
due
process
but
a
definite
property
deprivation
has
occurred.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
no.
i
am
saying
that
we
are
suffering
a
deprivation
of
property
by
the
enforcement
against
us
of
irrational
legislation
and
discriminatory
--
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
the
crux
of
the
irrationality
of
the
workman’s
compensation
approach
to
trying
to
serve
these
two
different
ends
is
that
workman’s
compensation
law
cannot
rationally
function
to
spread
that
risk
when
you
are
dealing
with
former
employers.
now,
the
reason
that
is
irrational
and,
we
think,
unconstitutionally
irrational
as
a
means
is
that
it
will
have
an
impact
that
is
entirely
unwarranted
and
unnecessary
and
competitive
in
fact
on
present
mine
operators,
will
impose
economic
obligations
on
them
to
pay
very
large
benefits
in
respect
of
workforces
in
the
past
that
may
have
been
very
much
larger.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
i
think,
practically,
under
this
act
he
would
become
almost
immediately
liable
to
pay
benefits
to
all
of
them
because--
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
yes,
principally
because
anyone
who
has
been
in
the
workforce
that
long
could
qualify.
virtually,
anyone
could
qualify
under
the
act
for
benefits
and
the
act
attaches
liability
to
active
workforces
on
the
basis
of
the
present
employer
or
the
last
responsible
operators,
the
concept
of
the
act
for
whom
the
claimant
has
worked
for
a
cumulative
year.
there
is
a
second
major
basis
upon
which
we
object
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
it
applies
not
only
to
a
liability
imposed
for
paying
benefits
to
former
miners
but
to
the
present
miners
as
well.
and
that
is
the
elaborate
presumptions
and
limitations
on
medical
diagnosis
and
diagnostic
criteria
included
in
the
act
which
the
government
concedes,
this
is
one
area
where
we
agree
although
we
might
differ
as
to
the
extent,
concedes
as
over
inclusive
in
the
sense
that
through
the
operation
of
these
presumptions
and
the
adjudication
of
claims,
miners
who
suffer
from
non-work
related
disease,
as
respiratory
diseases,
and
who
are
not
actually,
totally,
physically
disabled
may
qualify
for
benefits.
now,
i
will
be
frank
that
the
legislative
history
here
is
voluminous
and
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
occupational
disease
arising
out
of
the
breathing
of
coal
dust
other
than
coal
worker’s
pneumoconiosis
was
subject
to
dispute.
we
believe
that
if
the
record
were
analyzed
and
if
the
proper
weight
were
given
to
all
of
the
expert
testimony
that
we
would
find
that
that
dispute
is
more
apparent
than
real.
it
is
a
matter
of
volume,
and
that
all
of
the
medical
experts
in
the
area
including,
principally,
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
and
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
defendants
here
agree
that
this
is
the
only
disease
arising
out
of
breathing
of
coal
dust
that
can
be
defined
as
occupationally
related
and
disabling,
but
there
is
evidence--
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
silicosis,
as
i
understand
it,
is
what
is
much
broader
form
of
physiological
condition
and
coal
worker’s
pneumoconiosis
until
the
50's
in
this
country
was
thought
to
be
silicosis.
there
is
a
condition
or
conditions
called
the
pneumoconiosis
which
develop
from
breathing
dust
of
various
sorts.
coal
worker’s
pneumoconiosis
is
an
expressly
identifiable
physiological
condition
arising
out
of
the
breathing
of
coal
dust
as
opposed
to
flax
dust
or
stone
dust.
the
presumptions
in
this
act
are
deemed
rebuttable
for
the
most
part.
there
is
one
that
the
lower
court
struck
down
which
creates
a
presumption
of
total
disability
from
a
complicated
form
of
the
disease,
and
the
court
found
that
an
irrational
presumption
because
the
act
expressly
set
up
determination,
required
determination
of
the
existence
of
the
disease
and
the
total
disability
from
it
as
two
separate
factors.
i
think
the
court
was
clearly
right
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
i,
however,
think
that
the
court
seriously
misapplied
the
law
and
misunderstood
the
impact
of
these
presumptions,
of
the
rebuttable
presumptions
which
are
primarily
responsible
for
the
over
inclusiveness
of
the
diagnostic
criteria
that
the
department
of
labor
is
forced
to
apply
in
its
adjudication
of
claims
and
it
results
in
many,
many
people,
we
believe,
being
paid
compensation
for
diseases
such
as
chronic
bronchitis
and
emphysema
which
exists
in
25%
of
the
general
population.
there
were
6%
of
the
social
security
disability
benefits
to
the
general
public
are
payable
with
respect
to
respirable
diseases.
it
was
believed
by
the
public
health
service,
by
the
government,
that
when
this
act
was
first
enacted
that
there
would
only
be
about
53,000
beneficiaries
and
that
that
would
cost
the
government
about
$120
million
a
year
and,
to
this
point,
there
have
now
been
500,000
people
found
eligible
for
benefits
and
it
is
costing
$1
billion
annually.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
paradox
resulting
from
an
epidemic
of
the
disease.
i
think
it
results
purely
from
the
inclusion
of
great
numbers
of
people
in
the
benefits
eligibility
criteria
who
simply
were
not
made
ill
by
coal
mining.
now,
this
court
has
struggled
in
recent
years
with
how
to
treat
presumptions
and
especially
irrebuttable
presumptions
and
especially
implicit
presumptions.
we
really
do
not
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
these
are
plain
evidentiary
presumptions.
the
question
is,
is
there
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
to
be
proved
to
establish
the
fact
to
be
presumed,
and
is
that
presumption,
the
fact
presumed
fairly
rebuttable.
we
claim
that
it
is
not
fairly
rebuttable.
that
they
are
not
fairly
rebuttable
in
this
case
because
the
congress
has
written
in
to
the
legislation
limitations
on
rebuttal
which
make
it
impossible
to
distinguish
non-work-related
respirable
diseases
from
this
single
work-related
disease.
now,
if
this
court
is
going
to--
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
i
think
that
you
put
your
finger
on
the
crucial
problem
here.
i
would
agree
with
you
completely
that
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
congress
to
pass
a
law
saying
that
all
coalminers,
past
or
present,
who
have
a
respirable
disease
regardless
of
whether
it
is
work-related
should
receive
benefits,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
within
the
authority
of
congress
to
say
that
all
such
persons
having
such
diseases
should
be
paid
by
coal
mine
operators.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
because
the
coal
mine
operators
would
then
certainly
be
singled
out
as
a
class
to
pay
benefits
to
substantial
numbers
of
persons
who
are
suffering
from
a
disease
that
they
would
have
regardless
of
their
employment,
and
it
would
be
just
as
rational
or
irrational
to
single
out
any
clients,
as
long
as
there
is
not
that
nexus.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
there,
you
have
changed
the
question
somewhat.
you
are
saying
if
there
is
a
possibility
that
their
disease
has
developed
out
of
coal
mining,
that
that
is
sufficient
to
attach
that
liability
through
presumptions.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
probably
a
reversal
of
what
legislative
presumptions
have
always
been
designed
to
do.
far
more
often,
except
in
cases
of
intent
or
subjective
indeterminable
questions,
presumptions
are
only
appropriate
when
they
are
used
to
forego
evidence
of
a
fact
that
is
clearly
inferable
and
for
administrative
convenience.
we
would
submit,
in
this
case,
that
if
the
court
should
only
find
that
the
evidence
is
50-50
on
whether
any
other
respirable
diseases
are
caused
by
coal
mining.
that
finding,
in
itself,
should
be
sufficient
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
appropriate
for
congress
to
proceed
by
presumptions
at
all
because
there
is
no
question,
the
government
will
admit
that
these
same
respirable
diseases
exist
in
non-mine
employees,
in
the
general
population
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
way
to
determine
actual
causation
and,
in
that
case,
it
would
seem
sensible
and
it
would
not
seem
to
impose
this
court’s
values
on
congress
at
all
to
simply
say
this
is
a
case
where,
instead
of
redefining
a
disease
in
a
way
that
no
doctor
would
accept
absent
the
compulsion
of
law,
simply
say
you
will
compensate
for
the
occupational
disease
and
those
which
may
or
may
not
be
compensable.
and
then,
we
believe
that
if
congress
is
forced
to
do
this
it
might
examine
more
carefully
the
legislative
means
it
chooses
to
achieve
that
in
and,
in
so
doing,
might,
we
hope,
discover
that
it
is
not
rational
to
impose
that
liability
on
former
employers
of
those
people,
that
it
might
more
rationally
be
imposed
on
industry
and
ultimately
on
the
consumer
of
the
product
or
that
it
might
more
rationally
be
paid
out
of
public
funds.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
r.
r.
mcmahan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
only
feel
compelled
to
clear
up
a
very
dangerous
and
mistaken
impression
that
counsel
for
the
government
has
left
you
with.
the
part
c
program,
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
is
not
just
a
compensation
program.
part
c
program
is
a
reparations
program.
this
business
about
the
three
years
statute
of
limitations
is
an
illusion.
it
is
an
illusion
for
substantial
numbers
of
these
former
miners’
claims
because
the
act
has
redefined
the
disease.
now
that
means,
in
effect,
that
a
man
could
have
had
emphysema
for
30
years.
he
could
have
quit
mining
in
the
40s.
he
could
have
been
diagnosed
as
having
emphysema
for
30
years,
but
he
can
come
in
and
qualify
for
benefits
under
this
act
because
the
three
years
run
from
discovery
of
the
disease
and,
suddenly,
his
emphysema
is
diagnosed,
under
this
act,
as
coal
worker’s
pneumoconiosis.
they
have
many,
many
claims
against
the
22
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
some
80%
so
far
are
from
people
who
have
not
worked
in
mining
for
years
and
years
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
law.
this
is
not
at
all
comparable
to
retrospective
rating
or
adjusting
your
insurance
rates
from
year
to
year
even,
if
you
happen
to
be
one
of
the
few
operators
in
one
of
the
few
states
that
allows
that
kind
of
a
compensation,
and
this
is
purely
reparations
and
we
believe
that
it
is
irrational
that
this
legislation
is
an
irrational
way
of
delivering
those
reparations.
thank
you.
