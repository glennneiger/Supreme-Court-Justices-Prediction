mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
before
the
court
issues
for
reexamination
on
plenary
review
which
were
decided
last
term
in
the
court’s
summary
affirmance
of
a
three-judge
court
decision
in
the
district
of
columbia,
in
a
case
called
national
independent
coal
operators
association
against
brennan.
the
chief
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
in
the
national
independent
coal
operators
association
case,
the
three-judge
district
court
exercised
pendant
jurisdiction
over
challenges
to
the
implementing
regulations
of
this
act,
as
well
as
the
statutory
challenges
and
upheld
both
the
statutory
provisions
at
issue
and
the
regulations.
and
that
judgment
was
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
three-judge
court
in
the
present
case
declined
to
exercise,
pending
jurisdiction
over
the
challenge
and
the
regulations.t
he
issues
with
respect
to
the
regulations
have
been
remitted
to
a
single
district
judge
and
are
presently
being
litigated
before
him,
and
reached
only
the
statutory
issues
and,
for
the
most
part,
upheld
the
act
although,
in
two
respects,
it
ruled
that
the
act
was
unconstitutional
subsequent
to
this
court’s
summary
affirmance
last
term.
in
a
way,
the
case
is
reminiscent
also
of
this
court’s
decision
last
term
in
weinberger
against
salfi
which
we
iterated
and
elaborated
upon
many
of
the
governing
principles
which
we
think
apply
here.
congress
was
faced
in
this
legislation
with
extensive
medical
and
other
evidence
developed
through
a
lengthy
series
of
hearings,
both
in
connection
with
the
1969
act
and
in
connection
with
the
1972
amendments,
which
were
concerned
only
with
the
compensation
aspects
of
the
program,
with
the
problems
of
respiratory
diseases
among
coalminers
and,
particularly,
pneumoconiosis
which
is
a
chronic
disease,
an
irreversible
disease
which,
in
its
later
stages,
becomes
progressive
and
inevitably
fatal.
it
is
true
that
congress
first
gave
attention
to
these
problems
in
the
1960s
and
found,
at
that
time,
the
state
workman’s
compensation
laws
were
grossly
inadequate
to
take
care
of
these
problems,
but
the
disease
was
not
entirely
unknown
until
that
time.
it
was
first
recognized
in
england
and
elsewhere
in
europe
in
the
1930s
that
the
hearings
pointed
out.
so,
i
do
take
exception
to
the
statement
that
no
coal
mine
operator
could
have
known
of
these
dangers
for
the
miners
and
it
came
to
be
recognized
in
the
medical
profession
in
this
country
in
the
1950s.
be
that
as
it
may,
it
was
in
the
late
1960s
and
again
in
the
early
70s
that
congress
attempted
to
find
a
legislative
solution
to
these
serious
problems.
and
in
doing
so,
congress
was
concerned,
first
of
all,
to
strike
a
proper
balance
of
the
burden
between
the
federal
treasury,
the
industry,
and
the
victims
of
this
disease
in
attempting
to
provide
for
the
very
large
backlog
of
cases
that
had
not
previously
been
provided
for.
we
have
summarized
some
of
the
results
of
the
balance
congress
struck
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
the
figures
at
the
top
and
the
hundreds
of
thousands
are
figures
that
have
been
brought
in
to
the
part
of
the
program
paid
for
entirely
from
the
federal
treasury
with
respect
to
the
compensation
claims.
352,000
of
these
claims
have
been
approved
out
of
the
550,000
applied
for.
then
you
get
down
in
the
second
paragraph
on
page
25
to
the
portion
of
the
prospective
burden
largely
which
congress
thought
fit
to
assigned
to
the
industry.
we
are
talking
about
70,000
claims
that
have
been
filed
thus
far
with
an
estimated
yearly
rate
to
come
of
5,000-6,000
claims
and,
of
the
70,000
claims
filed,
only
21.6%
have
been
approved
for
payment.
the
approvals
are
running
at
rates
slightly
above
20%.
many
of
them
are
claims
that
were
already
rejected
under
the
federally
financed
portion
of
the
program.congress
was
solicitous
toward
the
industry
and
particularly,
as
a
result
of
the
1972
amendments,
set
up
the
program
so
that
it
is
doubtful
if
any
truly
retroactive
claims
will
be
made
against
any
of
the
companies
because
of
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
and
the
extension
of
the
federally
financed
portion
of
the
program
to
three-and-a-half
years,
followed
then
by
a
half-year
transitional
program
partially
financed
by
the
federal
treasury.
we
have,
on
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief,
noted
that
retrospective
aspects
to
legislation
do
not
necessarily
invalidate
it,
far
from
it.
there
are
numerous
cases
cited
there
and
in
footnote
29
of
the
brief
in
which
the
court
has
upheld
retrospective
application
of
laws
in
appropriate
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
the
review
board.
well,
these
proceedings
can
be
lengthy.
it
was
anticipated
at
the
time
they
were
established
that
the
awards
would
not
be
contested
in
so
large
a
percentage
of
the
cases
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
congress
was
hopeful
in
enacting
this
legislation
that
it
would
be
temporary
legislation
that
state
workmen’s
compensation
laws
would
be
amended
to
make
adequate
provision
for
this
disease
and
that
a
federal
program
would
not
be
necessary.
that
is
not
happening,
your
honor,
far
from
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
the
former
miners,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
are
not
in
the
principle
challenge
here
although,
the
figures
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
referring
to
are
the
figures
from
part
c
of
the
program
which
has
just
taken
effect
quite
recently--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
part
that
is
financed
under
workman’s
compensation
insurance
by
the
former
employers--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
are
being
administratively
appealed.
now,
this
is
the
early
administration
of
the
act
at
a
time
when
the
constitutionality
has
not
been
authoritatively
settled
even
after
one
summary
affirmance
by
this
court
and
perhaps
there
would
not
be
quite
as
many
appeals
once
the
matter--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
none
that
i
could
give
you.
i
cannot
say
i
have
looked
into
that
question
with
any
depth.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
i
am
sure
they
are
progressing
now.
at
the
time
the
brief
was
written,
this
part
of
the
act
had
been
in
effect
a
relatively
short
time
and
the
jurisdiction
was
moving
over
to
the
department
of
labor
from--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
some
amendments
are
being
made
but
not
amendments
that
meet
the
federal
statutory
standard
that
would
remove
the
federal
program.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
it
is
quite
a
few
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
nationwide
program
when
the
miners,
they
may
have
moved
to
any
state
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
about
25
states
in
which
there
is
some
coal
mining
that
amounts
to
something.
i
have
not
really
looked
into
that
figure
but
i
get
an
affirmative
nod
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
truly
retroactive
basis--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
a
claim
that
against
the
former
employer
which
had
fully
ripened
before
enactment
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
when
the
disease
had
become
manifest.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
would
consider
it
a
completely
retroactive
claim
for
purposes
of
the
usual
labeling
a
tort
in
workman’s
compensation
laws
would
be
a
claim
by
a
former
employee
who
knew
he
had
the
disease
or
he
should
have
known
it,
that
the
symptoms
arouse
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
act.
that
is
when
the
claim
ripens.
there
is
a
long
time
between
contraction
of
this
disease
and
its
detection
and,
because
the
act
is
set
up
with
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
and
it
is
not
until
three-and-a-half
years
after
its
enactment
that
employer
liability
comes
into
the
picture--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
three
years
from
when
the
disease
becomes
manifest
to
him.
that
does
not
mean
a
medical
diagnosis
of
it
but
it
is
when
the
symptoms
become
manifest
that
he
would
know
he
had
the
disease
and
it
is
very
unlikely
that
he
would
have
that
long
incubation
period
if
he
did
not
expose
himself
to
coal
dust.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
presumptions
would
operate
if
he
spent
the
requisite
amount
of
time
in
the
mines,
but
the
presumptions
are
a
matter
of
evidentiary
proof
to
which
i
will
turn
in
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
act,
until
the
act’s
expiration
day
which
now
is
december
30,
1981.
it
may
be
amended.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
proof.
if
they
meet
the
standards
of
proof,
the
act
rewards
benefits
only
for
pneumoconiosis
as
defined
and
aided
by
statutory
presumptions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
the
exclusive
reason
if
the
claim
can
be
established
by
means
of
the
other
pertinent
evidence
which
there
is
an
opportunity
to
contest,
x-rays
have
proven
to
have
a
25%
error
rate
based
on
the
only
really
reliable
evidence
which
is
autopsy
evidence
as
to
this
disease.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
it
will
turn
to
the
presumptions
now,
congress
was
faced
with
the
problem
under
this
act
of
a
disease
that
is
difficult
to
prove
and
difficult
to
disprove
and
it
wanted
to
set
up
what
it
thought
would
be
a
fair
system
of
compromising
between
bringing
more
people
into
eligibility
than
an
ideal
system
might
bring,
make
eligible
for
the
benefits
if
proof
were
easier
and
denying
benefits
those
that
it
felt
needed
them
that
it
wanted
to
help.
and
so,
it
set
up
a
scheme
which
we
have
tried
to
summarize
briefly
on
pages
37
and
38
of
our
brief.
and,
let
me
talk,
first,
about
the
evidentiary
presumptions
which
are
the
ones
that
begin
in
the
bottom
of
page
37,
and
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
them
is
i
do
not
think
that
scheme
of
the
act
was
fully
understood
by
the
district
court
and
it
is
concerned
about
these
presumptions.
it
seem
to
overlook
or
fail
to
understand
that
section
422c
of
the
act
contains
a
proviso
that
is
applicable
to
any
claim
for
benefits
against
any
operator,
and
that
is
on
page
7a
of
the
appendix
to
the
consolidated
brief
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
that
proviso
says
that
no
benefits
shall
be
payable
by
any
operator
on
account
of
death
or
total
disability
due
to
pneumoconiosis
which
did
not
arise,
at
least
in
part,
out
of
employment
in
a
mine
during
the
period
when
it
was
operated
by
such
operator.
so
that
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
making
a
defense
to
any
of
these
claims
to
begin
with
by
showing
that
the
conditions
in
your
mind
were
such
that
pneumoconiosis
could
not
have
been
contracted
by
the
claimant
in
your
mind.
second,
the
court
seemed
to
overlook
that
these
evidentiary
presumptions
attach
only
after
the
elements
that
trigger
them
have
been
established
in
an
administrative
hearing
in
which
the
employer
is
free
to
participate
and
contest
the
existence
of
those
elements.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
failure
of
an
opportunity
for
the
employer
to
contest
any
of
these
matters.
now,
the
first
of
the
presumptions
applying,
as
we
summarize
it
on
page
38a
there,
a
miner
who
has
worked
in
the
mines
for
10
years
or
more
and
shows
that
he
has
contracted
pneumoconiosis,
and
that
proof
can
be
contested
as
to
whether
or
not
he
actually
has
that
disease,
and
that
is
the
disease
that
is
occupationally
related
only
to
work
in
the
coal
mines.
then,
there
is
a
rebuttable
presumption--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
can
be
contested
also.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
a
problem
under
the
current
act
and
congress
has
amendments
under
consideration
now.
they
may
change
the
whole
scheme
of
it
for
the
future.
they
are
considering
setting
up
and
industry-wide
fund.
there
have
been
hearings
held
this
year
on
that,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
regulations,
he
could
still
make
a
claim
for
liability
against
the
one
who
is
still
in
business.
the
question
of
who
is
liable
is
remitted
by
the
act
entirely
solutions
and
the
regulations
are
now
before
the
court.
the
only
thing
that
is
established
in
the
act
are
methods
of
showing
eligibility.
the
question
of
who
then
is
liable
to
pay
the
benefits
is
a
matter
that
has
been
worked
out
in
the
regulations
and
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
the
regulations--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
say,
the
last
one
that
you
worked
for
is
presumed
to
be
the
one
that
has
to
pay
if
you
worked
a
year
there
but
if
he
can
show
that
you
could
not
have
contracted
the
disease
in
his
mines
because
of
the
conditions
of
his
mines,
then
it
reverts
back
to
the
next
one
before
him,
if
i
understand
the
regulations.
as
i
say,
the
validity
of
the
regulations
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
congress
has
decided
that
eligibility
for
compensation
from
the
industry
can
be
established
this
way
and
who
in
the
industry
pays
has
been
worked
out
in
the
regulations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
it
is
he
particular
former
employer
singled
out
in
the
regulations.
but
these
provisions
that
are
at
issue
are
the
provisions
about
how
you
establish
eligibility
for
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
this
is
always
a
defense
to
the
award
of
benefits
against
a
particular
employer.
that
is
a
showing
that
he
could
not
have
contracted
pneumoconiosis
from
the
work
that
he
did
for
you.
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
possible,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
possible
an
instance
could
arise
in
which
a
company
would
be
put
out
of
business.
the
main
protection
against
it
is
the
fact
that
the
three-and-a-half
year
period
of
exclusive
federal
responsibility
was
set
up
to
take
care
of
the
backlog
of
former
employees,
the
principal
part
of
the
backlog,
and
it
would
have
had
to
be
a
very
rapid
reduction
in
a
company’s
employment
that
would
result
in
the
situation
that
you
are
mentioning,
and
this
problem
has
been
complained
of
by
the
industry
and
it
is
one
that
congress
considered.
and
one
may
agree
or
disagree
with
the
solution
that
congress
reached,
but
i
think
the
court’s
decisions
make
it
clear
that
putting
someone
out
of
business
for
an
appropriate
reason
in
the
public
interest
is
not
a
constitutional
violation.
that
is
exactly
what
ferguson
against
skrupa
was,
and
a
complaint
by
someone
who
was
in
the
debt
adjusting
business
that
a
new
state
statute
saying
that
only
lawyers
could
be
in
that
business
was
depriving
him
of
his
rightful
occupation
and
that
he
was
a
fine
outstanding
businessman
providing
a
service
to
the
community.
the
court
unanimously
held
that
that
is
a
legislative
concern
whether
it,
in
the
public,
interest
restrict
that
business
in
the
circumstances
that
concern
the
legislature.
so,
i
really
think
it
is
a
legislative
argument
rather
than
a
constitutional
one
that
some
companies
will
be
hurt
more
than
others.
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
argument
in
williamson
against
lee
optical
co.
that
competition
was
being
affected
between
the
makers
of
the
prescription
glasses
and
the
makers
of
ready-to-wear
glasses
by
applying
the
regulation
only
to
the
maker
of
prescription
glasses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
if
it
results
from
the
fact
that
it
was
through
working
for
you
that
these
injuries
were
incurred
through
your
profit-making
activities
it
is
a
permissible
legislative
judgment
that
that
burden
should
be
placed
on
a
company.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
then
another
legislative
solution
undoubtedly
will
be
found
for
such
examples,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
these
are
the
moment
highly
speculative
concerns.
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
our
support
by
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
points
out
quite
cogently,
beginning
on
page
13
of
that
brief
though
page
17,
that
the
economic
impact
thus
far
has
been
minimal
and
it
cites
hearings
in
1973
that
first
began
consideration
of
amendments
in
which
it
was
reported
that
all
of
the
companies
have
thus
far
been
enabled
to
provide
additional
workman’s
compensation
coverage
under
the
regular
workman’s
compensation
insurance,
and
the
increases
in
premiums
thus
far
have
been
noticed
in
the
case
of
kentucky,
non-existent
thus
far.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
largely.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
and
large,
it
has
and,
of
course,
the
industry
is
in
a
relatively
strong
economic
position
now,
as
is
pointed
out
in
quite
persuasively
in
a
footnote
in
the
same
brief.
that
is
footnote
37
on
page
16
of
that
brief,
dealing
with
the
recent
profits
of
some
of
the
plaintiffs
here,
footnote
37,
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
some
time
lag
involved
here
which
is
true
of
doing
business
under
any
workman’s
compensation
scheme
and
this
takes
us
back
to
the
retroactivity
argument
for
a
moment.
the
plaintiffs’
brief
in
this
court
is
premised
on
the
notion
that
in
order
for
a
program
to
be
fair,
it
must
apply
only
to
current
employees
so
that
while
they
are
doing
work
the
company
can
price
its
products
in
a
manner
that
will
cover
the
cost
of
compensating
them,
but
that
is
not
actually
the
way
workman’s
compensation
laws
work
in
the
economy
at
all.
the
fact
is,
insurance
rates
are
adjusted
after
claims
experience
will
cause
them
to
be
adjusted
upwards
and
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
undoubtedly,
they
set
up
reserves
as
best
they
can
to
anticipate
these
matters
but,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
they
have
a
large
number
of
workers
disabled
through
injury
and
the
employment
and
who
become
no
longer
employees,
it
is
only
in
the
following
year
that
what
is
known
in
the
industry
is
retrospective
rating
will
cause
an
increase
in
their
workman’s
compensation
premiums
and
any
impact
that
the
company
feels
comes
after
these
people
are
no
longer
employees.
there
is
no
extra
cost
that
the
company
had
to
pay
while
they
were
employees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
true
of
a
self
insurer
but
the
prevalent
practice
is
that
there
is
a
retrospective
effect
that
is
very
similar
to
the
effect
under
this
statute.
not
only
that,
but
the
argument
by
analogy
would
carry
over
to
increases
in
benefits
to
be
paid
to
former
employees
which
congress
enacts
periodically
because
of
the
severe
inflation
that
we
have
had
for
workers
who
have
been
disabled
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act.
this
program
has
an
automatic
escalator
feature.
it
says
that
the
compensation
shall
be
one-half
of
what
a
disabled
government
worker
grade
gs2
will
receive
that
goes
up
as
inflation
goes
up
and
this
is,
by
analogy,
the
same
argument
could
be
made
with
respect
to
any
of
these
increases.
the
retroactivity
argument
would
really
be
an
argument
that
would
freeze
the
benefits
to
be
paid
based
on
contributions
that
may
be
and
the
salaries
that
may
be
woefully
out
of
date
in
terms
of
the
living
cost
for
disabled
persons
and
that
it
is
common
place
to
have
these
increases
under
state
workman’s
compensation
laws.
they
are
not
even
challenged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
only
provision
that
has
been
referred
to
as
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause,
federal
legislation,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
basically
is
substantive
due
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
seems
to
me,
basically,
a
substantive
due
process
claim
of
the
kind
that
was
made
in
ferguson
against
skrupa
and
williamson
against
lee
optical
co.
an
unfair
burden
is
being
placed
on
particular
competitors
in
the
economy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
basically
think
that
the
arguments
are
legislative
arguments
even
if
some
of
the
premises
of
them
were
not
faulty
which
seems
to
me
they
are,
that
workmen’s
compensation
typically
has
retrospective
consequences
and
it
has
long
been
upheld
in
that
context
anyway.
but
even
if
the
premises
were
not
faulty,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
legislative
rather
than
a
constitutional
argument.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
better,
but
there
is
nothing
arbitrary
of
that
nature
involved
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
like
to
concede
away,
the
power
of
congress,
but
it
certainly
would
be
a
much
more
substantial
argument
in
that
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
be
under
that
provision,
under
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause
because
it
is
hard
to
see
any
other
provision
that
would
be
valid.
it
might
be
upheld
as
taxing
provision
and
i
do
not
say
it
is
necessarily
constitutionally
vulnerable
but,
here,
you
have
got
a
system
that
is
rationally
based
in
the
sense
that
it
is
compensation
for
a
work-related
disease
by
definition
and
the
only
people
who
can
possibly
be
liable
are
employers
who
subjected
the
claimant
to
the
risk
of
that
disease
and
adjustments
have
been
made
in
the
kind
of
medical
evidence
that
will
carry
various
kinds
of
weight
because
of
detailed
medical
testimony
before
a
congress
that
showed
that
certain
kinds
of
evidence
such
as
x-rays
are
not
in
themselves
reliable,
if
through
a
contested
other
tests,
it
can
be
proved
that
you
have
this
disease.
and,
there
is
an
opportunity
to
contest
all
these
other
kind
of
medical
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
might
be
less
arbitrary
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
may
be
a
valid
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
in
the
form
of
a
compensation
system,
but
this
is
not
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
a
permissible
legislative
means
of
taking
care
of
this
problem,
but
i
do
think
it
should
be
recognized
that
there
is
nothing
novel
in
workman’s
compensation
about
presumptions.
the
ordinary
rule
in
workman’s
compensation
is
that
if
you
can
show
the
injury,
it
is
presumed
that
it
arose
out
of
your
employment
and
it
is
up
to
the
employer
to
rebut
that.
and,
in
a
way,
the
first
of
the
evidentiary
presumptions
cuts
back
on
that
rule
by
saying
that
you
have
to
show
also
that
you
were
employed
for
10
years
in
the
coal
mine
in
order
for
that
presumption
to
come
into
force.
in
the
ordinary
workman’s
compensation
case,
all
you
would
have
to
show
is
that
you
had
the
injury
and
it
would
be
presumed
that
it
arose
out
of
your
employment
unless
that
were
rebutted.
there
is
nothing
that
novel
about
this
scheme
of
compensating
injured
employees.
