i
think
the
challenge
here
is
not
what
the
plaintiffs
get
but
rather
who
has
to
pay.
what
do
you
concede
to
be
the
provision
of
the
constitution
that
is
an
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
not
my
question,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think,
when
you
say
that,
that
is
really
an
invalid
constitutional
claim,
almost
a
frivolous
one?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
congress
here
had
set
up
these
benefits
and
the
same
presumptions
and
then
said
that
the
payments
to
be
made,
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
financially
responsible
for
paying
these
are
all
the
corporations
of
the
united
states
whose
corporate
names
begin
in
the
first
13
letters
of
the
alphabet.
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
take
my
hypothetical
case.
would
that
be
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
