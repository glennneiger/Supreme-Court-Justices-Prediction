mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
narrow.
it
is
whether
the
district
court
should
have
dismissed
the
united
states
complaint
for
determination
of
its
water
rights
and
those
of
its
indian
wards.
the
merits
of
the
federal
reserve
rights
doctrine
are
not
before
the
court.
this
is
a
question
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
basic
claim
is
for
stock
watering,
camp
sites,
the
preservation
of
streams,
waters
sources
for
wild
life.
the
demands,
the
total
demands
of
the
national
forest
for
water
in
that
context
are
relatively
now.
in
fact,
there
is
a
study
which
was
prepared
in
1969
for
the
use
of
the
public
land
law
review
commission
which
is
described
at
page
844,
of
a
(inaudible)
releases
casebook
on
water
law,
a
1974
edition
and
it
points
out
that
even
if
you
take
all
of
the
government's
federal
reserve
rights
as
of
1969
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
all
rights,
the
indian
rights,
well
the
entire
range
of
a
federal
reservations,
you
come
out
with
a
percentage
of
something
like
--
well
2.2
million
acre
feet
out
of
363
million
acre
feet
that
arise
in
the
11
western
states
where
most
of
the
water
comes
from
and
that
amounts
to
about
less
than
one
percent
of
the
total.
now,
i
should
say
in
candor
that
there
is
a
problem
about
shale
oil
because
if
shale
is
developed,
the
water
demands
are
going
to
be
high
in
the
shale
areas,
but
i
understand
the
federal
government
has
indicated
to
the
companies
that
will
exploit
that
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
get
their
own
appropriated
rights
under
state
procedures.
now,
returning
to
this
case
the
merits
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
that
is
right
your
honor.
although
there
is
a
reservation,
there
are
some
reservations,
navy
reservations
which
were
put
aside
as
shale
outlet
stations.
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
a
different
and
that
really
gets
astound
to
what
the
reserved
rights
doctrine
is
about.
i
might
as
well
state
it
very
briefly.
it
is
always
qualified
by
the
purpose
of
the
reservation
and
really
that
is
what
we
were
seeking
in
this
case
is
relatively
narrow.
what
our
complaint
asks
is
that
the
federal
court
determine
three
things
affirmatively
for
the
united
states.
number
one,
it
determined
the
purpose
of
the
various
federal
reservations
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint.
i
think
the
examination
of
that
complaint
which
is
set
forth
in
the
petition
for
cert
will
show
that
all
except
perhaps
two
of
the
claims
are
reserve
rights
claims.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
with
--
well
not
quite
your
honor.
if
we
were
made
a
party
in
the
mccarran
act
proceeding
before
we
filed
in
the
federal
suit
then
the
federal
--
the
state
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
the
eagle
county
and
division
five
make
that
go
there
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
with
one
exception,
i
must
state
the
exception.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
or
perhaps
qualifying
it
another
way
even
if
mccarran
waives
immunity
for
indian
rights
it
would
waive
it
only
in
federal
courts
because
i
suppose
--
well
mccarran
on
its
face
does
not
restrict
itself
to
state
courts,
state
or
federal.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
it
would
not
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
what,
that
it
is
--
that
it
would
apply
to
federal
courts
as
well?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
reach
indian
rights?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
i
do
have
authority
for
it.
perhaps
i
should
turn
to
it,
although
our
position
is
that
you
do
not
need
to
reach
it
in
this
case.
if
you
agree
with
our
contentions
(voice
over)
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
let
us
turn
to
it
now
because
it
is
extremely
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
part
of
the
argument.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right
which
is
not
much
different
than
any
other
plaintiff
who
has
a
choice
of
a
forum,
federal
or
state,
who
chooses
a
federal
forum.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
in
the
circumstances
here
because
none
of
the
considerations
of
the
abstention
doctrine
and
the
comity
doctrine
apply.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
you
have
come
--
the
closest
you
have
come
is
with
the
nuisance
litigation
involving
obscenity
in
cases
like,
i
think
hoffman
against
pursue
last
term
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
quasi
criminal
(voice
overlap)
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
this
is
quite
different
because
here
is
the
situation
in
which
you
have
traditional
concurrent
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
on
the
face
of
the
statute
no
preference
is
declared.
all
it
says
and
we
set
it
forth
in
brief
at
page
three,
i
mean,
the
operative
words,
the
crucial
words
are
simply
consent
is
here
by
given
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
in
any
suit
for
general
adjudication
of
water
rights
whether
administration
and
(inaudible)
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
simply
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
now
in
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
what
we
have
submitted
in
water
district
number
seven
are
only
the
claims
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
only
the
claims
on
the
dolores
river,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
map
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
because
the
dolores
river
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
those
are
the
only
ones
we
have
submitted
because
the
dolores
river
is
geographically
separate
from
the
tributaries
of
the
san
juan,
which
all
run
through
the
indian
reservations.
we
have
tried
to
put
all
our
claims
with
respect
to
the
tributaries
to
the
san
juan
in
one
proceeding.
the
dolores
is
geographically
separate.
the
only
claims
we
have
on
the
dolores,
which
runs
to
the
northwest,
are
claims
i
think
for
the
western
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
only
on
the
san
juan.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
all
we
brought.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
federal
claim,
the
complaint
is
for
all
of
the
tributaries
of
the
san
juan.
well,
perhaps
your
honors
ought
to
look
at
our
map
which
is
in
the
back
of
our
brief
there
is
a
--
well
we
wanted
to
show
to
you
indian
reservations
because
they
are
fairly
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
are
accepting
eagle
as
conclusive
on
the
right
of
the
state
courts
to
make
as
a
party.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
we
have
never
sought
it.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
was
subject
perhaps
to
an
argument
about
and
eagle.
subject
perhaps
to
an
argument
about
removal,
which
is
not
here
and
is
somewhat
complicated.
we
have
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
as
mr.
balcomb
has
explained
under
colorado
procedure
there
is
always
a
state
proceeding.
it
is
continuous
proceeding
month
by
month
and
the
water
division
five
explains
that
in
the
totality
you
get
to
a
total
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
every
month
there
is
a
new
set
of
new
claims.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
where
people
can
come
in
and
ask
for
new
permits,
permit
is
the
wrong
word
in
the
colorado
practice.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
it
precedes
our
joinder
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
in
a
sense
that
they
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
the
sense
there
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
difference
is
that
the
federal
court
has
now
obtained
jurisdiction
over
the
united
states.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
from
being
joined
as
a
defendant?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
language
is
limited
to
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
where
we
are
the
defendant.
that
is
all
it
refers
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
no.
what
it
says
is
that
the
united
states
when
a
party
to
such
suit
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waive
any
right
to
plead
that
state
laws
are
inapplicable
or
that
the
united
states
is
not
arraignable
thereto
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty.
we
do
not
claim
that
we
cannot
be
made
a
party
in
the
state
proceeding
under
sovereign
immunity.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
can
proceed
in
the
federal
court
for
the
affirmative
determination
of
our
claims.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
state
court
can
certainly
proceed
with
respect
to
determination
of
the
rights
of
the
non-federal
parties,
that
is
rights
of
parties
other
than
the
united
states.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
affirmative
claim
of
the
united
states
should
be
determined
in
the
federal
court
which
first
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
is
the
usual
situation
of
adjusting
the
relationship
between
two
courts
having
jurisdiction.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
let
me
use
an
illustrative
case
which
i
think
is
dispositive.
in
markham
against
allen,
which
was
a
suit
by
the
united
states
for
the
determination
of
its
claims
on
behalf
the
alien
property
custodian
to
the
estate
of
the
deceased
alien.
the
state
court
had
complete
jurisdiction
over
the
reese
(ph)
of
the
estate.
the
federal
government
sued
in
federal
court
for
determination
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
as
to
its
interest
that
property.
and
this
court
when
case
reached
it
noted
that
there
was
the
issue,
there
was
the
reese
in
both
courts
and
it
said
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
that
reese
could
be
determined
in
the
federal
court
even
though
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction.
well,
that
is
very
much
what
we
are
involved
with
here.
there
is
not
always
a
continuous
proceeding
going
on
in
the
colorado
courts
over
the
rivers
there,
but
at
the
same
time
we
were
suggesting
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
can
be
determined
in
the
federal
court
subject
to
later
integration
in
the
state
proceeding.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
what
would
happen
--
well
this
goes
into
colorado
procedure,
but
in
effect,
we
could
walk
into
the
--
after
the
federal
court
decrees
that
the
rights
that
we
are
concerned
with.
it
says
that
the
united
states
is
entitled
that
two
priorities
of
1868,
1875,
1932
with
respect
to
reservations
x,
y
and
z
in
the
indian
rights.
and
it
says
that
the
purposes
of
the
reservations
are
agriculture,
forestry
and
so
on
and
the
third
thing
it
says
that
you
get
so
many
acre
feet,
it
quantifies
them.
if
we
take
that
decree
in
our
hand
and
we
either
brought
into
the
colorado
court
which
is
most
likely
are
we
going
and
we
presented
and
say
tabulate
this
into
your
overall
base
in
adjudication.
now,
that
actually
has
happened.
there
is
a
case
which
is
mentioned
in
our
complaint,
the
morris
and
ditch
decree,
which
is
entered
in
1932
with
respect
to
some
indian
water
rights.
it
was
adjudicated
in
federal
court
long
before
mccarran
of
course.
when
the
process
of
tabulation
which
is
now
going
on
in
colorado
begun,
the
state
engineer
in
his
tentative
tabulation
included
that
federal
decree.
and
this
is
simply
an
application
of
the
general
rule
that
a
federal
decree
determining
in
personam
rights
is
to
be
given
full
faith
and
credit
in
a
state
proceeding
and
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
res
judicata
apply.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
that
instance
i
think
that
since
the
priority
of
filing
in
what
is
essentially
an
in
personam
proceeding
is
in
the
state
court,
there
would
be
a
substantial
ground
for
the
federal
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
on
the
ground
on
priority
of
filing.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
of
course
they
could.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
is
a
question
but
there
is
also
an
answer.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
the
answer
lies
in
what
senator
mccarran
himself
characterized
this
statute
as
doing.
in
eagle
county
there
is
a
quotation
of
it.
it
is
in
his
letter
to
senator
magnuson
in
the
report.
he
assured
the
senator,
he
assured
everybody
on
the
floor
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
permit
the
joinder
in
general
adjudications.
it
did
not
command
the
dismissal
of
affirmative
suits
by
the
united
states.
there
is
no
fall
out
from
the
statute
beyond
that.
now,
i
really
have
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
indian
rights
because
it
is
been
asserted
that
the
indian
rights
issue
was
adjudicated
in
the
eagle
county
case.
i
do
not
see
how
that
could
be
when
there
were
no
indian
rights
before
the
court,
where
no
claims
are
involving
indian
rights
at
all.
instead
the
rights
involved
concerned
non-indian
claims
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
--
since
the
question
was
not
before
the
court,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
can
be
said
to
fair
when
no
one
really
litigated
it.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
would
argue
that
since
the
issue
was
not
here
at
most
it
would
have
to
be
oversight
because
of
the
way
indian
rights
are
treated.
there
is
a
very
firm
rule
that
indian
state
jurisdiction
over
indian
rights
is
not
recognized
except
when
expressly
granted
by
congress
even
when
there
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
now,
there
is
a
case
called
united
states
against
minnesota,
which
involves,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
which
involves
a
statute
that
permitted
the
condemnation
under
state
law
of
indian
lrt
land
and
a
suit
to
condemn
was
brought
in
the
minnesota
state
courts
and
when
that
case
reached
this
court,
the
court
held
--
it
is
true
the
condemnation
proceeding
can
go
forward,
there
is
a
waiver
of
immunity
to
that
extent,
but
it
has
to
be
brought
in
a
federal
court.
now,
that
principle
is
well
known
to
the
congress.
you
will
not
find
a
word
in
the
statute.
you
will
not
find
a
word
in
a
legislative
history
by
any
of
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
indicating
that
they
thought
that
indian
rights
were
to
be
swept
into
the
state
courts
and
then
finally,
just
13
months
after
this
statute,
congress
passed
its
pl
280
which
sets
up
a
procedure
by
which
indian
rights
can
be
brought
before
the
state
courts
if
the
states
will
follow
that
the
method
set
forth
in
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
my
point.
there
was
a
reference
to
water
rights
your
honor.
they
expressly
excluded
water
rights
of
indians
for
which
the
united
states
is
trustee
and
it
is
13
months
later.
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
said
that
this
statute
where
nobody,
where
there
is
no
mention
of
it
somehow
swept
the
indian
rights
in.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
much
more.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
was
only
addressing
the
indian
rights
if
i
loose
the
others
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
no
question.
we
have
the
same
right
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
question
because
we
are
simply
asserting
affirmative
claims.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well
i
do
not
think
that
the
indian
rights
themselves
off
themselves
create
any
additional
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
no,
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
that.
our
argument
is
there
is
no
question
we
can
assert
non-indian
rights
in
federal
courts
simply
because
there
is
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
1345
and
under
1331.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
has
been
argued
that
if
you
are
going
to
adjudicate
a
stream
it
is
helpful
to
have
as
much
as
many
rights
as
possible
--
asserted
at
the
same
time.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
no,
i
am
stating
the
assertion.
but
in
fact
the
--
it
is
perfectly
possible
do
the
contract.
for
example
a
water
rights
proceeding
separates
two
kinds
of
claims,
one
can
be
an
affirmative
claim
in
saying
determine
my
priority
and
my
quantity
and
you
can
come
in
as
a
defendant
and
saying,
he
is
not
entitled
to
his
priority
and
his
quantity.
now,
the
plaintiff’s
side
of
it
does
not
have
to
be
adjudicated
all
at
one
time
as
division
five
recognized.
you
can
do
it
piecemeal
as
long
as
they
are
ultimately
integrated
in
the
totality
and
what
we
suggest
is
what
i
have
suggested
under
markham
v.
allen
that
doing
it
this
way
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
mccarran
amendment.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
mccarran
amendment
is
to
get
the
united
states
out
from
behind
sovereign
immunity
to
get
it
to
assert
its
claims.
we
are
doing
that.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
removal
provision
was
removed.
there
was
an
express
--
in
senator
mccarran’s
bill
there
was
an
express
reference
to
removable
which
would
have
permitted
the
united
states
to
remove
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
by
removal,
where
it
was
a
defendant,
that
is
right.
but
of
course
the
elimination
of
the
removal
provision
does
not
in
itself
indicate
that
the
united
states
could
not
be
a
plaintiff.
in
fact
this
is
recognized
in
a
one
extensive
discussion
of
removal
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
is
just
as
consistent.
i
think
to
say
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
there
are
circumstances
in
which
we
could
remove
if
we
otherwise
come
with
an
existing
statutes
governing
removable,
1441
(a)
and
that
may
have
been
in
congress’
mind
as
well,
we
have
not
got
it.
there
is
an
argument
for
removal,
which
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
but
it
essentially
is
that
when
united
states
is
asserting
federal
water
rights
claims
in
its
plaintiff
capacity,
it
has
made
the
defendant
a
general
adjudication
and
it
has
asked,
whether
your
federal
water
rights
claim
state
them
affirmatively.
it
is
really
an
involuntary
plaintiff.
well,
if
it
is
an
involuntary
plaintiff,
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
under
28
u.
s.
c.
1345
and
in
under
1331
with
respect
to
the
federal
claims.
that
is
removable
under
1441
(a).
i
mean
so
there
is
an
argument,
which
is
not
here.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
what
we
arguing
over
in
eagle
essentially
was
whether
the
statute
permitted
reserved
rights
of
a
non-indian
nature
to
be
adjudicated
under
mccarran.
now
that
is
over
with
and
we
know
that.
we
can
still
bring
our
claims
affirmatively
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
there
is
still,
after
the
federal
affirmative
adjudication
filing
the
removal,
we
still
come
back
to
the
state
court
with
our
decree.
we
indicate
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
but
neither
is
it
a
burden
on
the
state
court
system
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
mccarran
does
not
indicate
anything
about
the
affirmative
adjudication;
it
simply
makes
us
amenable
to
state,
to
suit
as
a
defendant.
and
of
course
if
you
--
well,
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
i
think
to
recognize
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
separate
out
in
the
state
court
proceedings
the
federal
claims
in
any
event.
what
is
happened
in
eagle
on
remand
is
interesting.
in
divisions
four,
five
and
six
the
cases
have
been
consolidated.
then
they
have
been
set
before
a
single
special
referee
and
they
will
be
reviewed
by
a
single
water
judge,
so
that
they
have
had
to
create
a
separate
federal
proceeding
inside
the
state
proceeding.
now
the
federal
suit
is
exactly
that.
it
is
what
is
going
on
now
in
the
pyramid
lake
case,
united
states
against
nevada
which
was
remanded
by
this
court
to
the
--
not
remanded
but
we
were
referred
to
the
district
court
to
bring
our
suit
there.
that
is
exactly
what
is
going
on
here
now.
now
the
federal
suit
does
that.
it
makes
it
possible
to
have
review
of
our
affirmative
claims
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
takes
care
of
the
indian
problem
because
the
federal
court,
in
an
affirmative
suit,
clearly
has
jurisdiction
over
the
indian
problems
and
it
is
possible
to
integrate
the
whole
thing,
the
whole
federal
decree
back
into
the
state
proceeding.
now
if
you
start
with
the
proposition
that
federal
--
that
since
1789
the
united
states
had
the
right
to
bring
its
affirmative
claims
in
federal
court
and
its
indian
claim
in
federal
court,
and
you
recognize
that
is
not
state
court
jurisdiction
over
the
indian
claims
in
any
event.
and
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
for
us
to
bring
these
claims
affirmatively
in
the
federal
tribunal
recognizing
that
we
will
ultimately
integrate
them
into
the
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
if
--
mccarran
act
is
the
spur
your
honor.
we
are,
in
effect,
in
the
position
of
one
who
can
be
--
it
is
told
either
bring
your
claims
out
affirmatively,
so
they
can
be
determined
and
adjudicated
and
quantified
or
you
will
be
brought
into
the
state
courts,
or
perhaps
the
federal
court
because
i
think
the
act
applies
both,
to
have
them
adjudicated.
so
what
we
have
done
here
is
to
get
up
off
our
chairs
and
affirmatively
assert
what
our
water
rights
are?
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
congress
certainly
could
if
it
affirmatively
chose
to
do
so.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
certainly
that
aspect
of
the
mccarran
act,
if
you
wish
to
reach,
it
does
have
to
be
decided
because
the
matter
is
of
tremendous
importance
to
the
indians.
now,
in
this
connection
as
one
final
point
to
be
made
aside
from
public
law
280
which
i
have
mentioned.
even
the
most
recent
full-scale
study
of
indian
water
rights
and
national
water
rights
channel,
the
national
water
commission
report
suggested
that
because
of
doubts
over
what
the
impact
of
mccarran
amendment
was
on
indian
rights,
that
really
the
indian
rights
ought
to
be
adjudicated
in
federal
court.
now
these
are
a
body
of
--
this
is
a
body
of
experts
which
is
listening
to
all
of
the
arguments
about
this
question,
and
that
body
concludes
that
the
indian
rights
should
be
adjudicated
in
a
federal
court,
even
if
other
rights
are
adjudicated
in
the
state
court.
because
of
the
indians
concern
over
being
subjected
to
state
court
jurisdiction
that
shows
two
things
not
only
the
indians
concern
but
also
the
fact
that
you
do
not
need
to
have
every
affirmative
claim
asserted
in
the
same
court
as
long
as
ultimately
for
purposes
of
administration.
all
of
the
adjudicated
rights,
the
affirmatively
adjudicated
rights
are
integrated
in
a
single
proceeding.
now
the
--
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
serve
any
purpose
to
argue
about
the
abstention
doctrine.
the
traditional
doctrine
just
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
we
are
not
dealing
with
uncertain
state
law,
which
is
what
abstention
is
about;
we
are
not
dealing
with
constitutional
questions;
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
attempt
to
review
a
state
administrative
determination.
so
we
can
put
abstention
aside.
now
that
leaves
us
with
comity
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
comity
doctrine
that
has
ever
been
extended
this
far.
you
would
have
to
find
that
somehow
mccarran
has
a
fallout
a
shadow
around
it
that
requires
that
the
united
states
not
be
allowed
to
sue
affirmatively.
thank
you
your
honor.
