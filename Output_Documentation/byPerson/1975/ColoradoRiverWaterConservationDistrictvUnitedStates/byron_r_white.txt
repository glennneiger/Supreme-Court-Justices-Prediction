justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
district
court
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
district
court
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
more
than
just
abstention
i
mean
that
has
made
dismissed
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
with
the
idea
that
any
federal
claims
to
water
rights
would
be
submitted
to
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
any
--
even
any
claims
that
were
controlled
by
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
the
defendants
in
the
eagle
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
eagle
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
new
one,
that
is
the
one
that
was
filed
after
the
federal
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
proceeding
that
was
going
on
before
the
federal
case
was
filed,
it
was
not
a
defendant.
it
could
have
been
gone
in
and
filed
its
claim,
but
it
was
not
a
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
united
states
has
another
claim
i
take
it
that
whatever
eagle
said
about
reserve
rights
and
submitting
them
to
a
state
court,
whatever
it
said
does
not
apply
to
whether
indian
water
right
is
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
that
special
problem
in
here
even
if
the
adjudicatory
rights,
even
if
certain
united
states
rights
should
be
submitted
to
the
state
courts,
united
states
says
that
the
indian
rights
should
not
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but
that
did
not
involve
indian
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
the
united
states
agreed
with
you
about
all
the
rights
except
indian
rights,
they
do
not
agree
with
you
about
indian
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
eagle
did
not
have
indian
rights
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
they
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
something
else
again,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
served
in
a
state
suit
soon
after
the
federal
court
suit
was
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
before
anything
substantial
happened
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
fort
dix
had
a
criminal
case
in
the
state
courts
and
this
is
civil,
but
you
have
the
mccarran
act,
wholly
aside
from
younger
against
harris,
i
think
cases
like
that,
you
have
got
the
mccarran
act
that
says
that
this
federal
government
should
litigated
its
interest
in
the
state
court
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask,
i
notice
that
you
recite
that
the
united
states
filed
--
in
filing
its
reserve
rights
included
national
forests?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
tell
me
how
you
--
i
take
it
what
they
are
saying
is
that
if
you
want
to
analogize
to
putting
something
to
beneficial
use
once
you
have
taken
something
from
the
public
domain
you
have
automatically
announced
your
intention
of
using
whatever
water
you
need
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
now
but
--
now
what
kind
of
a
water
right
do
you
claim
for
a
national
forest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
do
not
need
to
do
that
--
i
mean
that
is
a
--
i
take
it
that
you
do
not
have
any
cruel
with
the
idea
that
the
federal
government
in
national
forest
can
keep
state
--
keep
the
states
from
covering
up
the
national
forest
with
a
dam.
you
do
not
have
much,
i
am
not
sure
(voice
overlap)
but
what
i
want
to
know
--
go
ahead,
you
say
that
they
can
claim
to
maintain
the
level
of
the
flowing
streams?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
as
beneficial
use
of
water
is
concerned
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
they
do
not
--
is
that
not
a
consumptive
use
at
all
for
a
national
forest?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
under
--
i
suppose
on
a
navigable
streams
and
if
there
is
going
to
be
dam
it
is
going
to
be
approved
by
the
--
who
does
that
have
to
be
approved
by?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
federal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
they
would
have
to
do
that
even
without
a
water
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
if
there
was
some
proposal
to
divert
water
from
one
water
shed
to
another
and
lower
the
level
of
the
flowing
stream
through
a
national
forest
there,
there
might
be
a
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
even
the
government
would
have
the
nerve
to
go
in
and
say
that
because
we
removed
certain
property
from
the
public
domain
and
made
it
a
national
forest
we
intended
at
the
time
to
reserve
enough
water
to
develop
shale?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be,
that
is
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
shapiro
let
me
--
it
might
help
me
of
my
--
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
argument
i
take
it
even
if
you
had
been
served
as
a
defendant
in
a
state
adjudication
prior
to
beginning
of
the
federal
suit
and
even
if
you
had
filed
your
claims
as
eagle
said
you
had
to
do
in
that
litigation,
you
would
still
be
here
saying
you
could
file
in
the
federal
court
and
have
the
federal
court
adjudicate
the
three
questions
that
you
are
about
to
tell
us
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
another
--
justice
byron
r.
white
indian
water
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
have
the
right
that
you
say
that
mccarran
act
does
not
reach
indian
rights
at
all
and
that
the
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
to
adjudicate
indian
water
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
it
is
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
(voice
overlap)
you
do
not
have
any
--
you
do
not
have
any
superior
--
you
do
not
have
authority
for
that
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that
the
mccarran
act
did
not
intend
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
make
it
--
you
just
say
that
because
you
got
to
the
courthouse
first,
the
federal
court
can
go
ahead?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
even
though
nothing
had
happened
in
the
federal
court
of
substance?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
is
this
different
also
if
you
have
the
mccarran
act
which
states
a
preference
for
united
states
in
litigating
its
claims
in
a
comprehensive
proceeding
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
simply
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
now
had
been
named
as
a
--
in
a
federal
--
in
a
state
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
now
party
to
the
adjudication
in
water
district
number
seven
and
you
have
submitted
your
claims
except
for
your
indian
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
your
adjudicative
claims
under
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
why
are
those
the
only
ones
that
you
submitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
confine
it
to
the
dolores
then.
you
still
think
you
are
entitled
to
go
ahead
in
the
federal
court
in
the
dolores?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
file
them?
did
you
file
them?
are
your
federal
--
is
your
federal
court
case
only
on
the
san
juan?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
okay.
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
federal
suit
did
not
involve
indians
at
all
and
you
had
filed
your
suit
on
the
--
and
settle
your
rights
in
the
san
juan
basis
and
then
the
state
court
started
it
--
then
you
were
joined
in
the
state
proceeding.
you
would
be
making
exactly
the
same
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
maybe
because
you
cannot
really
adjudicate
the
indian
rights
without
knowing
what
the
other
rights
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
its
claim
litigated
in
the
federal
court
if
it
wanted
it
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
but
if
the
state
proceeding
is
going
on
it
certainly
indicated
that
maybe
if
there
some
preference
to
have
the
federal
government
go
ahead
and
adjudicate
its
right
in
the
state
court
rather
in
the
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
not
suggest
that
he
--
if
it
was
a
party
that
the
state
court
proceeding
that
it
could
then
successfully
file
and
prosecute
a
federal
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
here
arguing
if
there
had
never
been
a
suit
filed
against
the
united
states?
if
they
had
never
been
named
a
party
to
the
state
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
except
for
mccarran
does
a
--
does
a
suit
in
federal
court
might
could
and
should
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
belcamp
can
i
ask
you,
what
about
the
indian
tribes
and
indians
in
within
reservations
who
have
the
title
to
their
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction?
could
you
name
the
indian
tribes
and
individual
indians
as
defendants
in
your
state
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
you
named
them
as
dependents?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
do
you
think
that
by
binding
the
united
states
you
bind
the
tribes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
--
what
would
you
think
if
they
were
patented
their
property
inside
indian
reservations?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
bind
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
find
the
indians
who
own
some
property
and
own
some
water
in
connection,
well
they
think
they
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
was
do
you
bind
the
indians
by
serving
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
that
is
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
hope.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
hope.
