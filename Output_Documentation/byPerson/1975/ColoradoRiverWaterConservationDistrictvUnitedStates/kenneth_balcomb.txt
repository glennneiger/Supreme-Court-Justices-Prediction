mr.
kenneth
balcomb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
petitions
here
consolidated
arose
out
of
one
case
below
in
the
united
states
district
court.
some
of
the
petitioners
joining
in
all
of
the
petitions
here
and
some
separately
and
of
course
had
by
the
court
consolidated.
all
petitioners
involved
joined
in
the
opening
brief
here,
in
the
reply
brief
and
have
agreed
that
this
one
argument
will
surface
for
all.
at
appendix
d
in
the
petition
in
74-490,
the
last
page
41a
was
a
small
map
which
shows
a
large
portion
of
western
colorado
that
some
western
colorado,
west
of
continental
divide
and
was
intended
to
show
when
relief
water
division
number
7.
we
will
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
with
this
exception
we
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
xerox
copies
of
it
upon
which
we
have
roughly
superimposed
the
boundaries
of
water
division
four,
five
and
six
to
emphasize
and
illustrate
some
later
discussions.
the
entire
geographic
area
of
colorado,
west
of
the
continental
divide
is
tributary
to
the
colorado
river
and
this
of
course
includes
that
area
in
water
division
number
seven.
since
the
1971
decisions
in
this
court
in
eagle
county
in
water
division
number
five,
the
united
states
has
been
improving
upon
its
claims
of
all
nature
and
from
whatever
source
they
might
have
been
derived,
including
there
reserve
rights
in
water
divisions
four,
five
and
six
and
the
water
courts
in
those
divisions.
they
have
not,
however,
done
so
to
date
in
water
division
number
seven.
if
the
court
will
remember,
in
1969
the
colorado
legislature
abandoned
the
water
district
method
of
adjudication
of
water,
there
are
then
some
70
water
districts
and
established
seven
divisions
for
such
purpose.
each
division
embracing
for
practical
purposes,
major
water
sheds
or
major
tributary
water
sheds
to
a
major
river.
the
1969
act
in
pertinent
part
is
reproduced
as
appendix
c
at
page
42
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
74-949
which
is
made
by
the
state
of
colorado
and
others.
i
have
the
feeling
that
neither
in
1971
nor
to
date
as
the
solicitor
general’s
office
clearly
understand
the
present
adjudicatory
statute
in
colorado,
that
is
the
1969
act
because
it
went
into
affect
on
july
1,
1969,
the
water
course
rope
through
business
on
a
continuing
basis
as
contrast
to
the
previous
law
requiring
an
affirmative
action
of
opening
and
adjudication
in
a
particular
water
district.
so
the
united
states
could
have
filed
its
claims
in
middle
1969
in
water
division
seven
and
certainly
after
this
court's
decision
in
eagle
county
in
water
division
five,
could
have
been
expected
so
to
do.
instead
on
november
14,
1972,
united
states
filed
what
can
only
be
denominated
as
a
quiet
title
action
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado,
asserting
the
claims
of
the
united
states
as
to
waters
of
the
san
juan
river,
naming
almost
1000
other
users
and
unknown
number
of
unknown
persons.
the
claims
such
as
in
water
district
four,
five
and
six
are
varied
and
include
national
monuments,
forest,
appropriate
rights
under
state
law
and
finally
claims
on
behalf
of
the
southern
ute
and
mountain
ute
indian
reservations.
very
promptly
thereafter
in
december
of
1972
the
united
states
was
served
pursuant
to
the
mccarran
amendment
in
water
division
number
seven
proceedings
where
upon
they
filed
claims,
similar
nature
except
as
to
the
indian
claim,
the
indian
reservation
claims
as
to
there
rights
on
the
dolores
river
which
is
the
other
principal
tributary
arising
in
water
division
seven
to
the
colorado
river.
all
petitioners
here
moved
to
dismiss
the
federal
court
action
which
the
district
court
did
orally
from
the
bench,
referring
specifically
to
the
intent
of
mccarran
and
to
the
two
previous
unanimous
decisions
of
this
court
in
eagle
county
in
water
division
five.
the
district
court
found
that
it
should
apply
comity
and
abstention
because
colorado
had
a
well
defined
and
workable
system
relating
to
the
questions
at
hand
developed
over
100
years.
the
u.s.
had
been
served
and
under
mccarran
that
was
all
that
was
required,
a
point
i
think
that
was
admitted
on
monday
in
connection
with
the
pupfish
case
by
the
solicitor
general’s
office.
the
solution
to
be
granted
by
the
federal
court
would
be
piecemeal
only
and
would
result
in
a
duality
of
adjudication
within
one
water
division.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
sir?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
it
dismissed.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
well,
they
dismissed
i
believed
on
the
grounds
of
comity.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
yes
as
they
are
doing
in
four,
five
and
six.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
--
that
the
state
court
apply
federal
law.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
and
the
state
--
and
the
district
court
below
so
found
that
they
must
apply
federal
law.
in
affect,
they
followed
what
we
believe
the
rule
in
burford
that
a
state
regulatory
system
was
involved
and
it
was
up
to
the
state
to
see
that
regulation
was
proper,
but
the
real
basis
for
his
decision
was
the
impracticability
of
assuming
jurisdiction
and
his
complete
oral
opinion
is
set
forth
in
74-940
petition
at
17a.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
set
forth
in
the
petition,
in
that
same
petition
as
74-790
at
1a.
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
cannot
be
said
to
be
at
a
very
great
disparity
with
the
district
court
and
did
not
rule
that
jurisdiction
was
federal
or
was
exclusive
in
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court
for
that
matter,
but
substituted
in
its
own
opinion
a
disagreement
as
to
the
result
of
abstention
and
ignored
comity
entirely.
we
cannot
help,
but
feel
that
this
court
had
already
settled
this
problem
that
is
again
before
it.
the
government
has
brought
us
back
and
has
raised
additional
points
which
namely
attempt
to
re-argue
the
application
of
mccarran
to
the
federal
reserve
right
which
the
court
has
all
ready
ruled
upon,
effectively,
again,
attempted
to
--
again
raised
the
possibility
that
fair
treatment
will
not
be
accorded
them
in
the
state
court
which
this
court
has
all
ready
ruled
emphatically
on,
just
dismissed
that
problem
out
of
hand
and
are
using,
we
feel,
the
problem
of
the
separate
indian
reserved
water
rights
as
a
spring
board
to
take
all
federal
cases,
federal
reserve
rights
and
adjudicatory
rights
back
into
the
federal
court
or
this
court
effectively
dropped
them
out
off.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
defendant?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
in
the
sense
that
a
person
is
a
defendant
in
a
water
matter,
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
in
this
case?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no.
but
they
are
also
defendants
in
the
water
divisions
seven
case
pending
now
in
the
seventh
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that
is
correct.
but
our
point
is
that
they
are
having
putting
into
affect
in
water
division
seven
a
dual
system
of
adjudication.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
but
they
jumped
over
that
problem
themselves
when
they
filed
not
only
--
the
claim
was
for
the
two
indian
reservations,
but
the
whole
shooting
match,
including
adjudicatory
rights,
rights
they
acquired
under
state
law.
had
they
confined
themselves
to
indian
that
might
be
one
problem,
although
we
think
it
is
still
would
have
been
in
violation
of
mccarran,
but
they
did
not
do
that.
they
only
took
one
river.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
it
is
our
position
and
i
think
it
was
admitted
by
the
as
i
say
by
the
solicitor
general’s
office
at
the
pupfish
case
that
nevada
could
still
commence
an
action
under
mccarran
in
nevada
and
make
the
united
states
come
in
(voice
overlap)
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no,
but
they
could
still
come
in,
so
we
filed
an
action
now
in
water
division
seven
and
we
say
they
should
have
automatically
filed
all
their
claims
because
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
eagle.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
agree
but
in
--
if
they
do
not
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
do
not
think
eagle
excluded
indian
rights
either
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
the
united
states,
one
of
them
included
in
anticipating,
they
would
very
possibly
win
that
case
and
they
wanted
all
the
reserve
rights
covered
by
the
win
and
they
lost.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
court
of
--
the
point
here
we
believe
that
has
been
conclusively
decided
as
i
say
it
and
i
think
so
also
that
the
district
courts
in
its
oral
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disagree
with
that,
but
merely
said
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
abstained
and
as
i
say
ignored
the
problem
of
federal
state
relationship,
the
federalism
theory
that
is
recognized
in
comity.
we
disagree
with
the
conclusion
obviously
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
they
should
be
reversed
for
all
of
the
practical
considerations
used
by
the
district
court
and
he
used
that
word
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
comity
dictated
we
think.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
and
where
we
think
also
that
abstention
could
have
been
used
as
a
ground
and
of
course
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
no.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes,
but
we
have
a
specific
statute
here.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
do
you
state
regulatory
system
and
you
add
numerous
other
claimants
of
water
involved
and
a
very
complicated
situation
which
is
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
you
have
the
special
federal
statute
authorizing
the
state
court
to
proceed.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
had
not
been
serve
under
mccarran
and
i
think
a
very
similar
situation
in
far
as
this
is
concerned
within
specific
livestock
where
the
federal
court
stopped
this
action
and
let
the
state
court
proceed
and
it
was
an
adjudication
proceeding.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
it
was
approximately
the
15th
of
december
they
were
served
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
think
five
defendants
were
served
and
there
never
has
been
one
shred
of
evidence
taken
and
those
defendants
were
the
state
bodies,
the
parliament
part
of
which
were
named.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
believed
we
cited
it
at
page
27
of
our
opening
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
pardon
me,
page
20
(voice
overlap)
i
am
reading
across
the
wrong
line.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
as
a
doctrine
is
frowned
upon
and
in
this
particular
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
did
not
want
to
go
on
into
it
of
course
because
it
is
our
position
that
no
matter
what
the
federal
reserve
right
is,
it
should
have
been
adjudicated
in
the
state
court
and
as
soon
a
service
is
made
they
must
start
their
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
realizing
from
the
position
of
the
government
that
they
were
going
into
that
question,
we
then
attempted
that
to
revisit
in
our
reply
brief
a
little
bit
of
mccarran,
but
it
was
exhaustively
covered
as
the
court
will
remember
in
the
briefs
in
eagle
county,
all
of
the
legislative
history.
and
i
think
it
can
be
unquestionably
said
that
first
of
all
mr.
mccarran
was
concerned
very
much
about
indians
in
all
of
the
hearings.
they
were
held,
indians
not
appearing
on
every
page
were
certainly
considered
again
and
again
and
again
and
considered
to
be
included
by
the
justice
department,
by
the
department
of
interior,
by
the
omb
reporting
for
president,
everybody
and
we
have
made
citations
in
our
reply
brief
to
that
effect.
second
of
all,
when
they
--
we
believe
that
when
this
court
acted
on
the
cases
they
thought
that
indians
were
involved
in
the
federal
reserve
rights.
the
indians
themselves
thought
so
as
our
brief
would
indicate
because
in
the
1971,
what
i
call
kennedy
hearings,
but
they
were
concerning
various
indian
rights,
a
great
human
cry
was
made
about
the
fact
at
the
eagle
county
and
water
division
five
covered
the
indian
water
rights.
and
the
court
will
remember
that
the
--
some
of
the
indians
themselves
thought
so
because
they
filed
a
novel
piece
of
paper
in
a
big
red
binder
in
which
they
wanted
to
express
in
it
an
interest
in
the
case
and
suggested
this
court
had
no
jurisdiction
because
they
had
covered
indians
by
the
decision.
and
all
the
way
up
to
now,
up
to
the
last
hearings
the
indians
have
been
sure
that
they
were
covered
until
all
of
a
sudden
when
the
last
government
brief
and
amici
brief
for
the
indians
has
filed
here
and
they
raise
other
defenses
than
that.
we
did
not
want
as
i
say
that
is
the
government’s
defense
to
this
problem.
it
is
not
our
--
we
did
not
want
to
re-argue
mccarran.
we
did
not
think
it
was
necessary,
we
did
not
think
this
court
should
have
to
bother
with
it
again
and
we
think
this
is
merely
a
guise
to
try
to
get
the
adjudication
federal
reserve
rights
back
in
the
federal
court
if
they
can
beat
us
to
the
courthouse.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
we
have
no
cruel
with
that.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
are
claiming
the
aesthetic
value
of
flowing
streams,
the
right
to
control
head
gate
diversions
or
storage
of
water
on
national
forest
to
make
bypasses
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir
and
to
require
a
bypass
for
fishery
purposes,
for
aesthetic
purposes
and
all
of
that
of
a
certain
quantity.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
claim
those
to
be
beneficial
uses
under
federal
law.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
only
to
the
extent
that
might
create
a
little
evaporation
which
is
a
benefit
also.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
department
of
agriculture,
forest
service.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
you
have
to
get
a
special
use
permit.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that
is
correct,
but
not
--
many
structures
were
built
before
the
special
use
thing
came
into
existence
and
united
states
is
claiming
a
right
antedate
those
water
rights
(voice
overlap).
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir,
and
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
problems
that
they
are
having
in
a
lower
court
because
this
is
exactly
what
twin
lakes
is
doing
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
san
juan
county
of
denver
is
doing
in
colorado
springs
and
so
forth
and
the
forest,
they
are
litigating
this
in
the
lower
courts.
how
is
it
going
to
come
out,
i
do
not
know.
it
is
been
four
years
in
progress.
that
is
an
awful
lot
and
i
could
describe
to
you
the
print
out
that
the
forest
service
alone
filed
and
on
the
right
of
a
national
forest
was
approximately
an
inch
thick
and
i
do
not
know
how
many
rights
it
contains,
but
when
you
total
it
all
up
it
amounted
to
about
a
thousand
acre
feet
of
water
and
a
hundred
flow
--
a
second/feet
of
direct
flow
presently
in
use.
it
covers
up
variety
of
things
like
stock
watering
holes
and
the
like.
well,
as
i
indicated
we
would
like
to
see
the
district
court
judgment
reinstated
and
it
is
at
20a
in
our
petition
for
the
totality
of
the
reasons
expressed
under
abstention
or
by
comity
as
the
district
courts
said
which
i
think
also
is
very
similar
to
the
languages
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
opinions
in
the
eagle
county
and
darrell
(ph)
case.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
sir?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
if
i
may
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
declaratory
judgment?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
would
say
yes,
sir.
i
just
want
to
remark
on
just
two
to
three
minor
items
or
maybe
some
of
them
are
not
so
minor
because
they
are
important.
the
national
water
commission
recognized
that
eagle
and
water
division
five
covered
indian
water
rights
and
recommended
that
congress
do
something
about
the
problem.
the
justice
department
recognized
that
as
late
as
1955
and
suggested
to
the
indians
at
hearings
that
they
should
go
to
congress
and
get
something
done
about
the
problem.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
that
is
what
they
suggested.
and
major
indian
water
lawyers
have
recognized
that
eagle
county
and
darrell
(ph)
cover
the
situation
as
far
indian
water
rights
are
concerned
and
that
congress
should
do
something
about
it
and
congress
has
done
nothing.
and
we
submit
that
if
they
interpret
it
that
way
why
should
not
this
court
agree
with
them
when
i
think
it
did
in
the
first
place.
in
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
which
related
what
happened
to
the
removal
provision.
in
the
original
act
it
was
removed
at
the
request
of
the
justice
department,
and
now
the
justice
department
is
asking
congress
to
put
it
back
in,
because
almost
every
case
that
they
attempted
to
remove
was
filed
in
state
court
initially,
is
bounced
back
where
the
federal
court
and
one
was
just
bounced
back
to
the
state
court
by
the
new
mexico,
united
states
district
court
the
other
day.
there
is
a
copy
of
it
in
the
back
of
our
reply
brief.
the
shale
reservation;
the
two
different
problems
involved
here.
the
government
is
making
a
claim
for
water
supposedly
reserved
in
connection
to
the
naval
oil
shale
reservations.
and
that
is
the
only
one
of
the
federal
claims
that
has
not
yet
been
tried
below.
when
it
will
be
set
up,
i
do
not
know
and
it
does
represent
a
large
quantity
of
water.
there
was
some
attempt
made
in
connection
with
the
lease
of
tracts,
colorado
a
and
colorado
b
recently,
as
well
as
the
utah
tract
to
say
that
there
was
a
water
right
in
connection
with
them.
and
what
interior
finally
said
was
no,
it
is
just
like
an
oil
and
gas
well.
if
you
drill
your
own
gas
well
and
it
water
bong
on
public
lands,
it
bongs
to
us.
and
that
is
in
all
the
leases
and
that
is
the
way
they
interpreted
the
oil
shale
problems
out
on
the
regular
public
domain
where
the
only
limitation
was
a
right
to
file
claims.
i
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
relief
asked
by
the
government
in
the
complaint.
they
want
a
special
water
master
which
is
not
necessary;
they
want
a
special
administrator
to
control
the
stream
separate
and
apart
from
the
state
system,
and
they
want
every
single
property
owner
already
in
decree
to
be
enjoined
from
violating
the
federal
court
decree
when
do
we
all
ready
have
administrator
system,
a
set
up
to
take
care
of
that
problem.
now
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
made
myself
clear
about
the
proposition
that
the
water
judge
in
water
division
number
7
has
jurisdiction
over,
simultaneous
jurisdiction
over
both
the
san
juan
and
the
dolores
rivers.
and
that
everybody
on
both
the
san
juan
and
the
dolores
rivers
is
bound
by
whatever
he
finally
decides
in
connection
with
the
water
rights.
and
the
consequences
of
this
reflect
itself
as
this
court
is
aware,
at
lee
farriers
on
over
the
division
is
made
between
the
upper
basin
waters
and
the
lower
basin
waters.
so
it
becomes
very
important
to
bind
everyone
in
litigation.
i
might
add
that
the
and
maybe
counsel
is
not
aware
of
this
the
motion
for
decree
that
entered
in
federal
court
has
been
administered
by
the
state
engineer
of
colorado.
i
want
to
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
what
would
be
here
--
i
am
afraid
i
have
to
take
the
position
that
i
would
not
be
because
mccarran
would
not
be
applicable.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
might
be
going
right
ahead,
yes,
if
referring
and
one
of
the
justices
read
a
part
of
the
mccarran
amendment.
the
counsel,
he
calls
specifically
to
the
fact
that
the
united
states
is
not
amenable
thereto,
in
other
words
the
united
states
cannot
plead
that
it
is
not
amenable
thereto
on
account
of
its
sovereignty.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
the
word
sovereignty
because
if
they
are
waiving
that
which
is
one
of
the
strongest
principles,
they
certainly
can
--
would
be
talking
about
everybody,
as
i
view
the
matter.
i
want
to
also
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the,
without
taking
up
too
much
of
the
court’s
time,
within
the
reply
brief
at
page
28.
in
the
letter
that
came
down
from
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget
speaking
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
appears
in
the
archives
escorting
to
footnote,
referring
to
section
208,
the
italicized
language.
the
complaint
was
there
made
as
it
was
made
by
the
justice
department
and
by
interior
that
if
that
provision
was
left
in
the
appropriations
act,
national
parks,
indian
reservations,
power
installations,
military
and
atomic
energy
establishments
and
irrigation
projects
are
only
a
few
of
the
interest
that
would
be
affected
by
the
mccarran
amendment.
they
all
knew
what
was
intended
to
cover.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
believe
that
those
are
primary,
the
pueblos
in
new
mexico
and
most
those
cases
has
been
in
federal
court.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
in
my
state
--
our
state
proceeding?
there
are
only
two,
there
are
two
tribes
it
is
the
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
the
reservation
water
right.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
southern
utes
and
we
have
not
done
anything
except
served
the
united
states
and
ask
them
to
come
forward
and
lay
out
their
claims
like
anybody
else.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
they
have
the
title.
just
like
they
have
the
title
to
the
forest
and
title
to
the
military
reservations.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
if
they
had
some
patent
of
property
as
i
say
that
might
compare
to
the
pueblo
situation,
i
do
not
know
that
that
is
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
true
or
not.
but
if
it
is
true
the
government
has
to
name
them
too
in
their
complaint.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
our
preceding?
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
if
mccarran
is
applicable
you
bind
them
by
serving
united
states
your
honor,
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
indians
themselves
apparently
filled
by
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
yes
sir.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
the
last
thing
--
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
pardon
me.
mr.
kenneth
balcomb
i
hope.
the
last
thing
i
want
to
call
to
is
the
recitation,
everybody
has
recited
it
including
mr.
justice
douglas
in
eagle
county
and
everybody
seems
to
attempt
to
ignore
it
when
they
discuss
what
an
adjudication
is.
it
is
at
page
5
of
our
reply
brief;
it
comes
out
of
the
senate
report
on
the
mccarran
amendment,
and
it
says,
“leaving
part
of
a
doubt,
in
a
suit
wherein
it
is
necessary
to
adjudicate
all
of
the
rights
of
the
various
owners
on
a
given
stream.
this
is
so
because
unless
all
of
the
parties,
owning
or
in
the
process
of
requiring
water
rights
on
a
particular
stream,
can
be
joined
as
party’s
defendant.
any
subsequent
decree
would
be
of
little
value.”
in
other
words,
the
mccarran
amendment
would
be
out
of
the
window.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
