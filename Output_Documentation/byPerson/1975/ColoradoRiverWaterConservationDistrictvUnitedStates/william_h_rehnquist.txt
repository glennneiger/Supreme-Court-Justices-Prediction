but
in
the
eagle
the
government
was
the
defendant,
was
is
not
mr.
balcomb?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes
and
here
the
government
is
a
plaintiff
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
there
was
an
ongoing
base
in
adjudication
in
the
colorado
courts,
but
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
defendant
at
the
time
it
filed
its
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
not
cited
i
believe
our
opinion
last
term
in
the
hicks
against
miranda
where
the
court
held
that
the
comity
situation
of
federal
courts
deferring
to
state
constitutional
adjudications,
even
though
the
federal
court
proceeding
commenced
first
if
nothing
much
had
happen
in
the
federal
court
proceeding,
the
federal
court
should
still
defer
to
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
i
apologize.
i
did
not
realize
it.
justice
william
h.

mmr.
shapiro
the
merits
of
that
pupfish
claim
that
your
colleague
mr.
randolph
argued
on
monday
were
before
is
not
--
there
maybe
some
spill
over
at
least
in
the
minds
that
some
of
us
between
the
two.
i
notice
on
page
7
of
the
government’s
brief
that
the
government
asserts
apparently
a
reserved
reserve
right
of
water
claim
by
reason
of
the
reservation
of
the
san
juan
national
forest
which
is
i
recall
is
a
huge
area
in
southwestern
colorado.
now,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
government’s
reserve
right
claim
when
it
is
talking
simply
about
a
national
forest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
all
the
rights
it
claimed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
at
sub
paragraph
2
on
page
3
of
your
brief,
the
language
which
justice
brennan
was
just
referring
to,
shall
be
subject
to
the
judgments,
orders
and
decrees
of
a
court
having
jurisdiction
may
obtain
review
thereof.
that
does
not
indicate
that
you
can
exempt
yourself
from
that
if
you
have
filed
a
case
in
the
united
states
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
priority
in
time
at
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
win
here
on
this
case,
i
presume
colorado
water
lawyers
can
go
back
the
day
our
mandate
comes
down
and
join
the
united
states
as
parties
in
each
of
the
basin
adjudications
and
then
that
argument
that
you
just
made
would
not
be
available
to
you
in
a
subsequently
commenced
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
should
be
the
disposition
if
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
colorado
tomorrow
decides
to
file
a
case
in
the
district
court
--
the
federal
district
court
for
adjudication
of
the
governments’
rights
on
the
dolores
river?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
judge
fine
silver
should
dismiss
even
in
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
justice
douglas’
language
when
he
speaks
of
reserve
rights
and
mentions
the
indian
claims
involved
in
arizona
versus
california
suggests
that
he
did
not
see
any
difference
between
indian
claims
and
other
reserve
right
claims,
is
that
not
a
fair
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
certainly
is
not
a
holding
and
maybe
you
can
say
that
if
someone
had
asked
him
or
asked
the
other
people
to
join
the
opinion
are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
this
in
view
of
the
indian
rights
they
would
have
come
to
different
conclusion.
but
the
intimation
of
the
language
for
whatever
its
worth
is
that
there
is
no
difference
as
to
among
reserve
rights
for
purposes
in
the
mccarran
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
general
civil
procedure,
there
was
no
reference
specifically
to
water
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
certainly
wasted
a
lot
of
time
in
the
eagle
then.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
eagle
really
is
not
over
if
you
write
about
you
are
right
about
your
right
to
remove.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
not
be
been
settled
outside
at
the
state
court
system?
i
mean
that
is
no
burden
on
the
government
system.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
that
it
denies
to
the
state
court
system
the
right
to
do
the
adjudication,
which
one
might
fairly
say
the
mccarran
act
intended
to
be
done
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
old
candelaria
case
in
271
u.s.
says
that
you
have
--
the
only
way
to
bind
the
indians
is
by
serving
the
government,
i
believe.
it
is
not
res
judicata
in
a
later
action
by
the
government
on
behalf
of
the
indians
if
you
have
not
served
united
states
the
first
time.
