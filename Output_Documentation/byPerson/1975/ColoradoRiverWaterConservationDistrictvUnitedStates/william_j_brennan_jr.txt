justice

j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
are
you
suggesting
that
even
were
they
right
on
classical
abstention,
but
they
know
constitutional
questions,
but
even
on
that
basis,
so
there
was
no
reason
to
abstain,
nevertheless
comity
principles
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
comity
required
deference
to
the
state
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
if
--
i
gather
even
a
questionable
constitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing,
no
constitutional
question
to
be
avoided
by
abstention
here,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
there
would
be
federal
questions?
i
mean,
abstention
you
usually
abstain
to
that
state
question
to
be
decided
not
federal
question
and
reserve
rights
with
federal
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
would
say
trying
to
get
why
it
was
--
and
what
you
said
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
that
even
if
you
are
wrong
that
abstention
may
have
been,
at
least
comity
should
have
let
them
to
defer
to
the
state
court
procedures?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
precisely
as
in
mccarran
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
it
you
--
federal
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
procedural
joinder
in
that
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
a
pending
state
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
you
have
not
been
joined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
the
second
sentence
of
mccarran
act?
the
united
states
when
a
party
of
any
section
shall
one
begin
to
have
waive
any
right
to
proceed,
the
state
laws
are
inapplicable
and
united
states
is
not
amenable
thereto
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty
and
shall
be
subject
to
the
judgments,
orders
and
decrees
of
the
court
having
jurisdiction
and
so
forth.
without
regard
though,
the
fact
that
--
what
is
a
reenact
statute
would
suggest
that
your
position
is
different
in
respect
to
the
application
of
that
sentence,
if
you
started
your
proceeding
before
you
were
joined,
the
federal
proceeding
for
the
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
i
am
asking,
when
is
it
--
when
in
this
--
in
mccarran
act,
tells
you
that
your
position
is
any
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
may
the
state
court
proceed
simultaneously?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
the
united
states
may
not
proceed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
rule
on
priority
of
the
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
there
not
a
question
here
whether
in
the
mccarran
act
the
congress
has
already
that
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
federal
courts
suit
involves
more
than
indian
rights,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
much
more.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
you
suppose
without
the
indian
rights
you
cannot
succeed
with
this
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
well,
i
suppose
if
you
loose
the
indian
rights
and
you
lose
the
whole
works,
but
may
you
even
if
you
are
properly
in
the
federal
court
where
indian
rights
might
you
drag
in
everything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
no
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
is,
if
your
foreclosed
from
asserting
any
indian
rights
in
your
federal
court
suit
because
you
have
indian
rights
involved,
may
you
sweep
in
other
things
that
otherwise
you
could
not
bring
it
into
federal
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
i
have
made
myself
clear
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at.
you
are
wrong
in
the
non-indian
rights.
they
have
to
be
adjudicated
in
the
state
proceedings.
may
you
nevertheless
insist
that
the
federal
court
decide
the
non-indian
rights
because
you
are
proper
in
the
federal
courts
in
indian
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
also
have
to
announce
no.

district
versus
the
united
states.
section
28
u.s.c.
1345
provides
that
except
there,
as
otherwise
provided
by
act
of
congress,
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
to
all
civil
actions
commenced
by
the
united
states
in
federal
courts.
in
invoking
that
section,
the
united
states
filed
this
action
in
a
federal
district
court
in
colorado
for
adjudication
of
reserved
water
rights
in
state
waters,
an
action
which
the
united
states
brought
on
behalf
of
itself
and
certain
indian
tribes.
shortly
after
the
action
was
filed
and
before
any
proceedings
beyond
the
filing
of
the
complaint
had
occurred
in
the
federal
court,
one
of
the
defendants
made
the
united
states
a
party
to
a
state
court
proceeding
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
claims
asserted
in
the
federal
action
adjudicated
in
the
state
proceeding.
and
that
application
was
pursuant
to
another
federal
statute
known
as
the
mccarran
amendment
which
gives
the
consent
to
the
united
states,
the
state
jurisdiction
concurrent
with
federal
jurisdiction
over
controversies
involving
federal
water
rights.
and
thus
this
case
presents
the
question
whether,
under
the
mccarran
act,
this
action
falls
within
the
exception
to
1245
as
an
act
otherwise
provided
by
congress.
the
district
court
thought
so
and
dismissed
the
federal
suit
in
light
of
the
mccarran
act,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
the
dismissal.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
light
of
the
mccarran
amendment
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
reinstate
that
of
the
district
court.
