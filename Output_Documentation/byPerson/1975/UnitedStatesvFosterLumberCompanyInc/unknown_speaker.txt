mr.
smith,
i
understand
your
position.
you
think
the
language
is
perfectly
clear,
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not
that
the
tax
court
takes
a
different
view
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
language,
particularly
the
meaning
of
taxable
income
in
the
context
in
which
it
is
used.
unknown
speaker
so
it
cannot
be
all
that
clear,
can
it,
if
the
agency…
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
case
the
benefits
are
highly-pyramided,
are
they
not?
do
you
not
end
up
on
your
formulation,
finish
taxing
of
this
tax
payer
on
$35,000
it
never
ends
if
you
aggregate
these
three
years?
unknown
speaker
don’t
the,
mathematics
work
out
that
way
precisely?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true
that
that
$17,000
is
just
a
pure
coincidence?
unknown
speaker
or
to
put
it
in
a
different
way,
if
in
1968,
he
had
the
same
income
picture
as
he
in
fact
had
in
1966,
there
would
have
been
no
excess
loss?
unknown
speaker
that
is
putting
in
the
same
opinion
that
way…
unknown
speaker
are
you
trying
to
say
that
you
are
glad
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
that
question?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
if
you
are
glad
or
sorry
about
that
question,
but
i
just…
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
anyway
you
think
of
it
the
tax
--
it
is
even
though
the
rate
is
lower
and
they
are
sifting
up
capital
gains
and
the
taxable
income
against
to
which
the
25%
rate
is
applied
is
still
what
exceeds.
unknown
speaker
so
anyway
you
have
figured
the
tax,
the
taxable
income
exceeds
the
amount
of
the
loss?
unknown
speaker
carryback.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
mr.
smith
that
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
the
burr
under
the
saddle
is
judge
raum’s
decision
in
chartier.
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
service
endeavored
to
get
the
statute
clarified?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
been
seven
years
since
chartier…
unknown
speaker
but
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
that
was
an
incorrect
one?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
that
you
would
be
up
to
that
if
you
really
felt
stronger
about
that.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
the
principal
occupation
of
the
irs?
unknown
speaker
temporarily.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
as
a
matter
of
information,
have
any
new
briefs
been
filed
in
this
case
since…
unknown
speaker
29,
yeah,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
because
it
has
been
fully
absorbed
under
the
first,
under
that
position.
unknown
speaker
because
their
taxable
income
has
been
taxed
at
capital
gains,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baker
could
i
stop
you
for
a
minute
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
this
one
argument,
i
am
not
sure
i
do.
you
say
that
the
result
under
the
1939
code
is
not
clear.
they
say
it
clearly
would
have
gone
for
the
government
and
you
say
there
are
no
decisions,
but
do
you
not
rely
on
the
words,
to
which
such
laws
maybe
carried
to
support
your
position
and
is
it
not
correct
that
they
were
not
a
part
of
the
1939
statute,
therefore,
doesn't
it
follow
that
you
would
not
had
an
argument
under
the
language
of
1939
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
because
they
thought
it
was
very
simple.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith
on
the
very
point,
your
opponent
says
the
regulations
really
just
parrot
the
language
of
the
statute
that
there
are
no
examples
in
point,
nothing
really
clarifying
it.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
but,
then
the
regulations
really
do
not
add
anything
to
the
statute
in
my…
