justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
the
--
does
the
loss
--
is
a
loss
available
to
taxpayer
in
’66
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
apply
it
to
his
income,
and
your,
the
income
is
more
so
the
loss
is
all
used,
but
how
about
in
figuring
his
alternative
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
use
the
same
amount
of
capital
gain
as
you
--
as
he
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
what
the
quarrel
is.
i
just
want
to
know
from
you
just
from
my
own
information
whether
or
not
the
alternative
tax
is
figured
on
the
full
amount
of
the
capital
gain?
justice
byron
r.
white
$166,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
a
$166,000.00
or
the
$173,000.00
is
capital
gain.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
will
apply
the
$42,000.00
to
reduce
the
total
taxable
income
to
$131,000.00?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
say
that
the
$34,000.00
ought
to
reduce
the
amount
of
capital
gain?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
certainly
is
true
then
that
the
taxpayer
gets
no
benefit
whatsoever
from
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
reduced
the
amount
of
capital
gain,
he
would
get
some
benefit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
say
it
is
not
at
issue,
but
it
is
an
important
matter
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
you
are
saying,
we
must
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
taxpayer
gets
no
benefit
whatsoever
from
$34,000.00
of
his
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
all
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
he
does
not
get
any
benefit
from
this
$34,000.00,
you
say,
he
gets
no
tax
benefit
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
taxpayer
had
$15,000.00
for
the
capital
gain
in
’66,
and
the
same
loss
to
be
carried
back?
i
suppose
the
loss
carried
back
to
reduce
taxable
income
would
have
eaten
up
all
that
income,
it
would
have
eaten
up
all
of
the
loss,
i
mean,
it
would
eat
up
all
of
the
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
there
would
been
no
alternative
tax
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
my
example
there
would
have
been
--
the
taxpayer
could
not
have
just
carried
forward
that
part
of
the
--
carried
forward
the
part
of
the
loss
carry
back
that
was
not
eaten
up
by
ordinary
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
had
been
ordinary
income
of
five
and
capital
gain
of
fifteen,
the
carry
back
would
have
been
reduced
by
twenty?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
just
by
five?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
claim
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
losses
in
carryback
the
loss
and
deducted
against
ordinary
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
irrational?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
every
taxpayer
who
has
ordinary
income
can
use
his
loss
to
offset
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
year
that
it
is
just
carried
over
within
the
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
not
that
has
been
discriminated
against,
that
is
just
that
people
who
have
or
who
just
can
not
deduct
it
from
capital
gains,
just
as
case
is
in
the
same
year.
