mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit.
it
involves
an
application
of
section
172
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
which
permits
carry
back
and
carryover
of
net
operating
loss
deductions.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent
can
carry
back
a
$42,000.00
net
operating
loss
incurred
in
1968,
as
an
offset
against
its
1966
taxable
income
of
$174,000.00,
and
after
that
offset,
used
$35,000.00
of
that
loss
a
second
time
against
its
1967
taxable
income.
from
a
mathematical
and
statutory
standpoint,
we
submit
the
answer
to
this
question
is
plainly,
no.
the
$42
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
but
we
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
confident
they
will,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
we
think
it
is
a
way
which
is
supported
by
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
did
not
benefit
the
taxpayer
in
the
sense
it
did
not
reduce
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
did
not
reduce
its
tax
liability.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
disappeared
by
operation
of
the
statute
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
mr.
justice
powell.
we
submit
that
no
part
of
the
$42,000.00
loss
remains
for
offset
against
1967
income,
the
facts
are
stipulated
and
relatively
straightforward.
in
1966,
the
taxpayer
corporation
had
taxable
income
of
a
$174,000.00.
in
1968,
it
incurred
a
net
operating
loss
of
$42,000.00.
in
accordance
with
section
172
of
the
code,
the
respondent
carried
back
its
loss,
$42,000.00
loss
to
1966.
once
that
loss
arrived
back
in
1966,
the
respondent
had
to
re-compute
its
tax
liability
for
its
earlier
year
in
1966
as
if
that
loss
occurred
in
1966.
now,
it
had
to
re-compute
its
tax
liability
pursuant
to
the
code
under
two
different
methods.
one
is
the
so-called
“regular
method.”
section
11
provides
for
taxation
of
corporate
income
in
accordance
with
prescribed
rates.
now,
once
having
subtracted
$42,000.00
from
$174,000.00,
it
arrived
at
the
recomputed
taxable
income
of
$132,000.00.
if
the
tax
on
that,
on
the
regular
--
according
to
the
regular
method
was
$58,000.00.
it
then
engaged
in
an
alternative
tax
computation,
which
was
provided
for
corporations
pursuant
to
section
1201
(a)
of
the
code.
that
alternative
computation,
it
is
permitted
for
corporations,
which
have
net
long
--
net
long-term
capital
gain.
now,
its
computation
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at,
the
various
computations
at
page
four,
the
court
will
see
that
under
the
alternative
method,
the
respondent
subtracted
its
$42,000.00
loss
from
its
$174,000.00
of
taxable
income
and
again
had
recomputed
taxable
income
of
approximately
$132,000.00.
it
then
had
engaged
in
the
two-step
computation
pursuant
to
the
alternative
tax.
it
subtracted
its
capital
gain,
well,
essentially
for
short-term
--
for
shorthand
purposes
we
call,
its
long-term
capital
gains,
its
partial
tax-base
was
zero
or
negative
amount
and
then
it
added
it
to
that
a
flat
25%
tax
on
its
capital
gains,
the
tax
under
that
method,
“alternative
method,”
was
$41,000.00.
now,
pursuant
to
the
code,
the
taxpayer,
the
prescribed
tax
is
the
lower
amount
that
is
applicable.
now,
this
suit
involves
the
year
1967.
all
the
computations
i
have
described
thus
far
were
applicable
to
year
1966.
the
respondent
filed
a
refund
claim
for
that
year
and
that
is
the
year
it
sued,
asserting
that
even
though
its
$42,000.00
loss,
it
was
1968,
had
been
subtracted
from
its
taxable
income
of
$174,000.00
to
yield
a
recomputed
taxable
income
figure
of
a
$132,000.00,
it
claimed
that
$35,000.00
of
that
loss
was
still
available
to
offset
its
taxable
income
in
1967
which
amounted
to
about
$229,000.00.
now,
the
district
court
upheld
the
respondent’s
claim
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
so
holding
however,
the
eight
circuit
acknowledged
that
its
decision
was
contrary
to
the
applicable
treasury
regulations,
which
were
adopted
shortly
after
the
1954
codification.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
so
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
is
my
impression
that
the
government’s
position
has
uniformly
been
in
accordance
with
the
position
we
urge
here
and
i
might
add
also
that
the
commentaries
shortly
after
the
1954
coder
in
the
late
50s
and
early
60s
prior
to
the
tax
court’s
chartier
decision,
were
uniformly
in
support
of
the
government’s
reading
of
the
statutes.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
eight
circuit’s
decision
in
this
case,
there
were
two
circuits,
which
had
rejected
our
position.
however,
they
were
briefed
per
curiam
affirmances.
in
fact,
the
first
circuit
in
dismissing
the
government’s
appeal,
i
mean,
affirming
and
dismissing
the
government’s
position,
just
characterized
the
position
as
unimportant
and
seldom
occurring.
the
eight
circuit
here
frankly
acknowledged
that
it
was
influenced
by
the
cumulative
weight
of
these
two
adverse
circuit
decisions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
one
was
an
affirmance
of
the
tax
court
in
the
chartier
case
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
the
other
one
was
in
affirmance
of
a
district
court,
california
decision,
the
olympic
foundry
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
which
came
after
the
chartier
decision.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
which
the
united
states
district
court
relied
upon
the
tax
court
and
was
affirmed
per
curiam
by
ninth
circuit.
now,
shortly
after
within
about
three
months
of
this
decision,
the
fourth
circuit
issued
what
we
believe
is
a
well
considered
and
comprehensive
opinion
in
the
mutual
assurance
society
of
virginia
corporation
case,
in
which
the
government’s
position
was
squarely
upheld
as
conforming
with
the
statutory
definition
of
taxable
income.
shortly
after
that,
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
axelrod
case
rejected
an
individual
taxpayer's
similar
attempt
to
cumulate
and
pyramid
the
benefits
of
both
the
net
operating
loss
carried
back
provisions
and
the
alternative
tax
computations.
we
submit
a
resolution
of
this
issue
depends
upon
a
careful
analysis
of
the
applicable
statute,
which
is
section
172
of
the
1954
code,
specifically
subsection
(b)
(2).
the
pertinent
part
of
that
statute
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
the
top
of
page
18.
it
provides,
“the
portion
of
such
loss,
which
shall
be
carried
to
each
of
the
other
taxable
years,
shall
be
the
excess
if
any
of
the
amount
of
such
loss,
over
the
sum
of
the
taxable
income
for
each
of
the
prior
years
to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried.”
now,
the
term
“taxable
income”
in
the
statute
is
important.
that
is
a
technical
term,
which
is
elsewhere
defined
in
the
code
in
section
63
(a),
and
taxable
income
in
accordance
with
this
definition
means
gross
income
minus
the
deductions
allowed
by
this
chapter.
now,
here
the
19
--
taxpayer’s
1966
taxable
income
was
indisputably
a
$174,000.00.
its
1968
loss
$68,000.00
--
it
was
$42,000.00.
carrying
back
the
$42,000.00
loss
to
the
$174,000.00
of
taxable
income,
as
the
statute
prescribes,
in
our
view
demonstrates
that
there
was
no
statutory
excess
of
a
loss
over
taxable
income,
which
the
taxpayer
could
then
use
for
a
succeeding
year.
now,
the
eight
circuit
in
this
case,
in
grappling
with
this
admittedly
technical
problem,
said
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
plain
meaning
in
the
statutory
language
that
would
dispose
of
this
controversy.
the
court
then
engage
in
what
we
think
is
an
erroneous
groping
for
policy
considerations.
we
think
the
statutory
language
is
absolutely
plain
and
admits
of
no
other
rational
interpretation.
the
statute
prescribes
that
the
loss
be
netted
against
taxable
income.
here
the
taxable
income
was
$174,000.00,
the
loss
was
$42,000.00,
there
is
no
excess
to
carry
forward
to
the
year
1967.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
do
not
think
it
is
ambiguous
mr.
justice
powell,
and
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i,
well
i--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think,
i
think
that
is
correct
and
i
have
as
much
deference
for
the
tax
court
as
perhaps
anyone,
but
i
think
in
this
instance
they
misconstrued
what
we
think
is
plain
statutory
language,
which
demonstrates
that
our
interpretation
is
the
correct
interpretation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
do
not
think
the
eight
circuit
is
--
was
wrong,
but
i
think
in
looking
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
in
any
statutory
interpretation
case,
i
think
the
courts
necessarily
must
look
for
policy,
but
i
think
they
were
wrong
in
their
initial
premise,
that
the
statutory
language
had
no
plain
meaning
and
that
it
was
necessary
then
to
look
to
some
external
purpose.
these
are
detailed
statutes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
that
they
had
been
amended
constantly
since
1921
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
discern
any
particular
policy,
because
at
any
given
time
technical
amendments
are
introduced
which
alter
what
one
might
perceive
to
be
a
basic
policy.
to
us
--
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
statutory
historical
evidence
of
how
this
decision
should
come
out,
it
seems
to
us
that
section
122
(b)
of
the
1930
code
--
1939
code
is
instructive
in
the
sense
that
i
think
it
is
without
beyond
doubt
as
we
have
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
that
the
taxpayer’s
position
is
impossible
under
the
1939
code
because
the
phrase
upon
which
they
rely,
the
final
phase
of
the
statute
“to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried”
did
not
exist
in
the
1939
code.
and
when
congress
amended
the
net
operating
loss
carried
back
and
carryover
provisions
in
1954,
there
is
no
indication
that
172
(b)
(2)
was
meant
to
do
anything
different
than
it
had
done
under
the
1939
code.
there
were
number
of
changes
and
the
committee
reports
discuss
them
at
great
length,
the
span
of
years
was
enlarged
and
a
variety
of
things
were
accomplished,
but
this
basic
proposition
that
in
determining
how
much
of
a
loss
is
“available”
after
it
proceeds
back
was
always
to
be
a
netting
of
loss
against
taxable
income,
which
in
this
case
includes
all
income,
both
ordinary
income,
what
on
my
quote
ordinary
income
and
capital
gains
and
in
this
case,
that
amount
is
a
$174,000.00
and
the
$42,000.00
loss
simply
does
not
survive
past
that
computation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
is
the
loss
available
to
the
taxpayer
in
’66?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
in
figuring
his
alternative
tax
as
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
course,
if
you
--
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
computation
at
page
4
you
will
--
$42,000.00
is
offset
against
the
$174,000.00
of
taxable
income,
that
yields
taxable
income
of
under,
pursuant
to
section
63
(a),
of
approximately
$132,000.00.
now,
i
think
the
quarrel
between
the
parties
is
to
the
effect
that
it
--
it
contends
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
alternative
tax
is
figured
on
the
full
amount
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
$166,000.00
and
that
is,
25%
of
that
yields
to
the
tax
figure
for
that
year.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
be
possible
to
say
that
as
an
abstract
matter,
but
it
has
been
settled
that
that
is
not
to
be
the
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
gets
no
reduction
in
its
tax
liability,
although
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
but
the
weil
case
has
disposed
to
that
proposition
and
that
--
and
that
the
correctness
of
the
weil
issue
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
tax
in
fact,
the
very
tax
court
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
--
it
is
even
strictly
at
issue
mr.
justice
white,
because
for
purposes
of,
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
our
--
with
our
computation
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
gets
no
reduction
in
tax
liability,
that
is
right
and
essentially
that
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
might
if
the
figures
were
different
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
another
taxpayer
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
this
one
did
not
simply
because,
if
you
look
at
1967,
the
table
at
page
three
of
our
brief
you
will
see
that
there
is
a
large
amount
of
ordinary
income
and
a
large
amount
of
capital
gain,
so
there
would
not
be
any
benefit.
even
under
a
contra-weil
approach,
although
we
do
submit
--
so
we
do
submit
strictly
speaking
that
since
the
year
1967
it
is
at
issue
here
for
this
taxpayer,
the
correctness
of
weil
is
not
really
an
issue
in
this
case,
although
we
submit
that
it
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
reason
we
are
not
giving
him
credit
so
to
speak,
that
simply
by
operation
of
the
alternative
tax
computation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
now,
for
the
taxpayer
to
prevail
we
submit,
you
would
have
to
in
effect
merge
these
two
statues
1201
(a)
and
172,
and
we
submit
they
are
simply
not
to
be
merged.
now
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
may
be
true
as
a
legislative
matter,
but
we
submit
that
when
congress
used
the
term
“taxable
income”
in
section
172
(b)
(2),
it
very
specifically
rejected
the
notion
of
segmentation
of
these
two
kinds
of
--
of
taxable
income
into
its
component
parts
which
the
alternative
tax
computation
takes
into
account.
when
this
$42,000.00
loss
is
carried
back,
what
the
taxpayer
essentially
is
doing,
is
introducing
the
mechanics
of
the
alternative
tax
computation
with
its
segmented
approach,
that
is
its
partial
tax-base
plus
the
alternative
tax,
plus
the
25%
flat
tax
computation,
into
the
interest
deices
of
section
172
(b)
(2).
and
we
think
that
without
some
indication
from
congress,
because
the
statute
is
replete
with
modifications
to
the
basic
--
to
the
basic
concept
of
taxable
income,
and
there
is
no
modification
which
would
admit
the
segmented
computation
that
the
taxpayer
seeks
to
introduce.
there
are
only
two
statutorily
prescribed
computations;
one,
the
regular
tax
computation
and
two,
the
alternative
tax
computation.
what
the
taxpayer
is
trying
to
do
is
to
take
its
$42,000.00
loss
and
net
it
against
a
segmented
part
of
its
1966
taxable
income,
and
without
any
statutory
warrant
for
that
position,
we
submit
that
it
is
simply
not
acceptable
without
some
indication
by
congress
that
this
was
to
be
the
result.
now,
we
think
that
the
statute
does
pose
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
the
taxpayer’s
position,
and
as
a
result
it
has
to
construe
the
statute
in
accordance
what
we
believe
is
a
forced
and
no
natural
reading.
now,
looking
back
at
page
18
again
of
our
brief,
it
argues
that
the
phrase,
“to
which
such
loss
shall
be
--
to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried,”
modifies
the
phrase
taxable
income
as
well.
now,
that
was
essentially
the
gist
of
the
tax
court’s
holding
in
chartier
real
estate
company.
and
we
submit
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
saying
that
the
loss
of
$42,000.00
is
carried
back
against
only
the
$7,000.00,
which
represents
the
partial
tax-base
under
section
1201
(a).
there
is
no
support
in
the
legislative
history
to
that
approach
and
moreover
the
term,
“carry”
contrary
to
the
taxpayer’s
argument
and
the
taxpayer
--
and
the
tax
court’s
position
has
a
temporal
connotation
and
not
insofar
a
loss
is
carried
back
from
19
--
from
one
year
to
another,
from
1968
to
1966.
and
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
the
loss
is
carried
back
to
a
particular
type
of
income
in
1966,
it
is
carried
back
to
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
you
say
that
we
have
a
$42--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
have
been
no
alternative
tax
and
the
loss
would
have
eaten
up
all
of
the
income.
we
submit
that
essentially
the
alternative
tax
is
a
separate
statutory
system,
designed
by
congress
to
benefit
the
taxation
of
capital
gains
and
it
cannot
be
--
its
mechanics
cannot
be
imported
into
this
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
your
example
with
no
capital
gains,
the
regular
tax
computation
would
have
been
used
and
whatever
the
--
if
--
then
it
would
have
been
forty-two
less
fifteen
and
there
would
have
been
a
remaining
loss
available.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
essentially
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
we
submit.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
which
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
it
involves
section
172
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954,
which
permits
carrybacks
and
carryovers
of
net
operating
loss
deductions.
the
question
presented
is
whether
respondent,
a
corporation
can
carryback
a
$42,000
loss
it
incurred
in
1968
as
an
offset
against
its
1966
taxable
income
of
$174,000
and
thereby
reduce
its
taxable
income
to
$132,000
and
after
that
offset,
take
$35,000
of
that
$42,000
loss
and
use
it
as
an
offset
against
its
1967
taxable
income?
we
submit
that
from
a
mathematical
and
statutory
standpoint
the
answer
to
this
question
is
plainly
no.
$42,000
can
only
be
used
once
to
offset
the
$174,000
of
taxable
income
and
no
part
remains
for
further
use
as
an
offset
for
1967.
the
facts
are
fairly
straightforward
and
were
stipulated
to
the
district
court
and
can
be
summarized
as
follows:
in
1966,
respondent
had
taxable
income
of
$174,000.
in
1968,
it
had
a
loss,
ended
operating
loss
of
$42,000.
now,
pursuant
to
section
172,
respondent
carried
back
its
$42,000
loss
to
the
third
year
that
is
1966,
and
then
proceeded
to
compute
its
1966
tax
liability
as
if
that
$42,000
loss
was
incurred
in
that
earlier
year.
now,
the
code
for
corporations
prescribes
two
methods
of
taxation:
one
the
so-called
regular
method
under
section
11
of
the
code,
provides
for
regular
corporate
income
tax
rates,
and
in
this
case
that
regular
method
yielded
a
tax
liability
of
$58,000,
those
are
the
corporate
rates
on
a
$132,000
of
taxable
income,
which
was
$174,000
minus
$42,000.
now,
under
section
1201(a)
of
the
code,
respondent
was
required
to
compute
its
tax
under
the
alternative
tax
computation,
which
corporations
can
avail
themselves
off
when
they
have
capital
gains.
it
engaged
in
the
prescribed
computation,
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
4
under
the
alternative
method.
basically
it
is
a
two-step
approach.
it
took
its
$173,000
or
what
we
say
was
$174,000
essentially,
subtracted
the
$42,000
loss,
got
taxable
income
of
$132,000
and
then
what
it
had
to
do
was
to
subtract
out
its
capital
gains,
and
basically
the
step-one
operation
to
tax
yielded
zero
or
a
negative
number.
it
then
had
to
compute
the
capital
gain
segment,
the
step-two
part
of
the
partial
tax,
the
capital
gains
tax,
which
is
a
flat
25%
of
the
$166,000
of
what
the
statute
refers
to
as
long-term
capital
gain
over
short-term
capital
loss,
but
for
these
purposes,
we
simply
call
capital
gains,
and
it
got
a
tax
liability
of
$41,000.
now
under
the
code,
respondent
was
required
to
report
its
tax
liability
under
the
net
effect
yielded
to
the
lower
liability,
so
it
did
and
it
paid
taxes
of
$41,000
for
1966.
now,
this
suit
involves
the
year
1967.
respondent
filed
a
refund
claim
and
asserted
that
even
though
its
$42,000
loss
had
been
used
to
offset
its
taxable
income
in
its
entirety,
that
somehow
it
still
has
$35,000
of
this
loss
available
to
offset
income
in
1967.
respondent’s
claim
essentially
is
that
a
segmented
approach
is
the
proper
approach
and
that
is
that
the
$42,000
1968
loss
should
only
be
offset
against
its
$7,000
of
ordinary
income
and
that
yielded
$35,000
for
use
in
the
subsequent
year.
the
district
court
in
missouri
upheld
respondent’s
claim
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed.
in
so
holding,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
the
eighth
circuit
acknowledged
that
its
holding
was
contrary
to
the
treasury
regulations
which
have,
which
were
promulgated
shortly
after
the
1954
codification
and
have
existed
more
or
less
in
the
same
state
ever
since.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
was
just
getting
to
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
think
that
treasury
regulations
are
correct
and
we
think
the
tax
court
in
this
case
is
incorrect
as
i
will
attempt
to
demonstrate.
at
the
time
of
the
eight
circuit’s
decision,
the
first
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
indeed
rejected
the
government’s
position,
but
all
be
it
in
brief
per
curiam
affirmances.
in
fact,
the
first
circuit
characterized
this
question
as
unimportant
and
seldom
occurring
even
though
i
think
that
subsequent
developments
have
indicated
that
the
issue
is
important
and
frequently
occurring.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
told
the
court
that
there
are
about
$34
million
of
taxes
riding
on
this
issue
and
that
it
frequently
occurs
because
of
the
operation
of
the
alternative
tax
and
the
net
operating
loss
carryback.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
characterize
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
as
influenced
largely
by
the
cumulative
weight
of
two
appellate
decisions
rejecting
the
government’s
position.
but
thereafter,
and
in
fact,
within
three
or
four
months
after
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
fourth
circuit
rendered
its
decision
in
mutual
assurance
society
versus
commissioner,
which
we
submit
to
the
court
as
a
well
reasoned
and
proper
analysis
of
the
statutory
problem
here
and
thereafter
the
sixth
circuit
in
axelrod
versus
commissioner
upheld
the
commissioner’s
position
in
a
case
involving
an
individual
taxpayer,
but
its
opinion
largely
criticizes
the
tax
court’s
decision
in
chartier
real
estate
co.
and
speaks
approvingly
of
the
fourth
circuit’s
decision
in
mutual
assurance
co.
now,
the
resolution
of
this
problem
depends
upon
a
careful
analysis
of
the
applicable
statutory
provision
which
in
this
case
is
section
172(b)(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
we
have
set
out
the
pertinent
part
of
this
provision
at
top
of
page
18
of
our
brief.
the
statute
reads
the
portion
of
such
loss
which
shall
be
carried
to
each
of
the
other
taxable
years
shall
be
the
access
if
any
of
the
amount
of
such
loss
over
the
sum
of
the
taxable
income
for
each
of
the
prior
taxable
years
to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
submit
that
taxable
income
is
a
statutory
term
of
art
and
that
it
is
defined
in
section
63
of
the
code
which
we
have
set
forth
at
page
36
in
our
appendix
through
our
brief
on
the
merits
which
again
says
that
taxable
income
is
gross
income
minus
the
deductions
allowed
by
this
chapter.
now
in
1966,
the
respondent’s
taxable
income
was
$174,000.
carrying
back
that
loss
and
determining
the
excess
if
any
of
the
amount
of
such
loss
over
the
sum
of
the
taxable
income
for
1966,
demonstrates
in
our
view
that
that
loss
is
completely
absorbed
and
that
there
is
no
longer
any
part
of
it
available
for
use
in
a
subsequent
taxable
year.
now,
respondent
basically
does
not
dispute
the
definition
of
taxable
income
which
is
set
forth
very
plainly
in
the
code,
but
it
submits
that
because
it
used
the
alternative
tax
computation
in
the
early
year,
that
somehow
that
requires
a
different
result
in
this
case.
now,
we
submit
that
the
statutory
language
is
plain
and
that
disoperation
of
subtracting
$42,000
from
$174,000
in
yielding
a
$132,000
of
taxable
income
is
dictated
by
the
statute
and
that
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
any
further
modifications
from
the
statutory
term,
'taxable
income'.
indeed,
if
the
court
would
examine
section
172(d)
of
the
code,
you
will
find
that
there
are
basically
a
group
of
modifications
that
congress
has
prescribed
from
the
term
'taxable
income',
but
the
modification
that
respondent
seeks
to
engraft
on
the
code
is
not
here.
these
are
detailed
statutes
and
we
think
in
the
first
instance
that
the
language
has
to
be
employed
pretty
much
in
a
mechanical
sort
of
way
because
these
are
detailed
and
mechanical
statutes
designed
to
provide
limited
kinds
of
relief
for
averaging,
so
to
speak
and
alleviating
some
of
the
harsh
results
that
might
be
caused
by
annual
accounting
method
which
is
sort
of
bedrock
of
our
tax
system.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
we
think
and
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
set
forth
at
great
length
in
its
opinion,
we
think
that
the
tax
court’s
reading
of
the
statute
is
somewhat
forced
and
unnatural
because
it
would
require
the
insertion
--
if
you
bear
with
me,
i
am
looking
again
at
page
24
of
our
brief
which
sets
forth
the
statute
again
--
we
say
here
that
the
tax
court’s
construction
views
the
statute
as
if
it
read
the
sum
of
the
taxable
income
to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried
for
each
of
the
prior
years
to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried.
indeed
that,
the
phrase
to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried
would
have
to
be
repeated
twice
in
order
to
shore
up
the
tax
court’s
construction
or
as
we
would
submit
modification
of
the
statute.
but
as
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out,
even
if
you
were
to
say
that
loss
had
to
be
carried
back
against
taxable
income,
it
still
requires
some
substantial,
we
think
re-writing
of
the
statute.
you
would
have
to
say,
loss
carried
back
against
taxable
income
which
in
this
case
is
still
the
same
$174,000,
but
you
would
have
to
further
say,
but
only
to
the
extent
that
there
was
no
reduction
in
tax
liability
and
we
think
the
fact
that
there
was
a
reduction
in
tax
liability
here
for
1966,
this
as
a
function
of
congress’
attempt
to
impose
a
lesser
burden
on
long-term
capital
gains
and
we
think
this
is
basically
a
statutory
trade
off.
essentially,
you
either
get
the
alternative
tax
benefits
or
you
get
the
operating
loss
carried
back.
we
think
that
it
is
improper
for
the
tax
court
to
have
concluded
that
these
benefits
be
pyramided,
in
effect
cumulated,
if
you
will.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
do
not
think
so
because
i
think
that…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
there
may
be
confusion
over
tax
base
and
taxable
income
to
be
sure
there
is
a
tax
computation
on
a
$166,000,
but
it
is
at
a
markedly
lesser
rate
than
the
corporate
rate,
it
is
flat
25%,
this
is
an
enormous
benefit
and
this
produces
a
tax
liability
of
$41,000.
now,
otherwise
the
corporation
would
have
had
to
pay
$58,000
tax.
now,
in
this
particular
case
although
i
think
it
is
coincidental.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
graphic
that
the
very
“lost”
benefit
that
the
taxpayer
complains
of
that
is
the
loss
of
a
$35,000
loss,
which
in
effect
is
worth
$17,500
is
made
up
pretty
much
equally
by
the
difference
between
$58,000
and
$41,000
which
is
also
$17,000.
so
the
congress
basically
said
you
either
do
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
this
is
basically
a
statutory
trade
off.
we
do
not
think
that.
we
agree
that
there
is
the
loss
of
the
benefit
of
this
$35,000
loss.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
is,
but
i
think
it
is
a
helpful
gauge
in
this
case
because
essentially
corporations
generally
pay
a
tax
on
50%
of
their
taxable
income
and
in
this
particular
case
they
are
paying
a
tax
on
$25,000
of
a
larger
base.
but
we
think
that
essentially
you
cannot
sort
of
cumulate
these
benefits
and
we
think
that
the
statutory
language,
the
use
of
the
term
taxable
income,
signals
congress’
clear
intent
to
provide
this
kind
of
straight
mathematical
equation.
i
think
if
there
is
evidence
in
the
legislative
history,
here
i
think
i
commend
to
the
court
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit’s
exploration
of
the
history
of
the
statute,
which
indicated
that
this
result,
the
result
that
the
taxpayer
seeks
in
this
case,
would
not
have
been
available
under
section
122(d)
of
the
1939
code,
which
did
not
use
the
phrase
through
which
the
taxable
that
last
phrase,
to
the
prior
taxpayers
to
which
such
loss
may
be
carried.
it
simply
talked
about
over
net
income
of
the
intervening
year
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
reenacted
the
statute
without
any
attempt
to
buttress
without
--
it
is
the
committee
reports
are
totally
silent.
it
said
essentially
prior
law
is
reaffirmed
and
prior
law
under
the
old
statute
clearly
would
have
rejected
the
taxpayer’s
petition.
i
also
think
that
it
is
not
without
coincidence
that
shortly
after
the
1954
code
was
codified
and
before
the
tax
court
decided,
it
rendered
its
chartier
decision
that
the
commentary
was
uniformly
to
the
effect
that
there
could
be
situations
where
a
loss
would
be
“loss”
so
to
speak.
that
essentially
you
are
either
going
to
get
the
alternative
tax
computation
or
you
are
going
to
get
the
net
operating
loss
carried
back
and
then
after
chartier
came
down,
i
must
confess
that
i
have
looked
into
this
question
and
asked
the
people
of
internal
revenue
service,
they
received
a
lot
of
calls
from
private
tax
people
also
expressing
surprise
about
the
chartier
decision.
i
know
that
the
history
of
this
litigation
is
somewhat
dogged
from
the
commissioner’s
point
of
view,
we
have
sought
to
establish
a
conflict
of
decisions
and
we
have
succeeded,
but
it
basically
because
we
think
that
this
sort
of
--
there
are
approach
corresponds
to
legislative
history.
the
post
chartier
commentary
is
pretty
much
uniformly
in
our
favor
as
well
and
since
the
following
of
our
briefs
a
new
article
has
come
out
more
or
less
to
so
to
speak
the
balance,
a
critical,
the
only
critical
article
we
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
tax
lawyer,
which
is
the
publication
of
the
aba
section
on
taxation,
but
an
article
in
29
tax
lawyer
in
4,
1975
issue,
entitled
“net
operating
losses
and
capital
gains,
a
deceptive
combination”
and
that
again
supports
the
commissioner’s
view
that
you
cannot
cumulate
and
then
support
the
view
of
the
fourth
circuit,
that
you
cannot
cumulate
the
benefits
of
these
privileges.
i
think
it
is
also
useful
if
i
may
to
sort
of
try
to
go,
try
to
explore
for
a
moment
the
underpinnings
of
this
whole
net
operating
loss
deduction
and
to
demonstrate
as
i
think
can
be
done
that
the
fourth
circuit’s
approach
here
is
eminently
a
sound
one.
for
example,
what
the
net
operating
loss
carryback
deduction
is
attempting
to
do
is
to
in
effect
say,
okay,
this
$42,000
loss
occurred
in
1968,
but
we
are
going
to
pretend
as
if
it
occurred
in
1966.
let
us
assume
that
it
occurred
in
1966.
i
think
in
this
case,
it
is
absolutely
plain
that
what
would
happened
would
be
that
the
same
$41,000
of
tax
would
be
paid
by
the
taxpayer
and
that
there
would
be
no
net
operating
loss
carryover,
there
would
be
no
net
operating
loss
for
that
year.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly
and
to
the
extent
that…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
to
the
extent
that
there
have
been
complaints
about
timing
and
that
our
position
more
or
less
exact
rebates
accidents
of
timing
as
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out,
the
taxpayer’s
position
also
turns
on
the
timing
of
these
things.
i
think
the
fact
that…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
always…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
statutorily
prescribed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
in
this
sphere,
you
can
neither
be
glad
nor
sorry.
there
are
things
that
just
are
and
these
are
legislative
pronouncements
and
we
think
that
the
statutory
language
is
such
that
to
demonstrate
that
this
loss
is
no
longer
available
for
use
in
1967.
i
want
to
talk
a
little
--
i
just
want
to
mention
one
other
point
and
that
is
this
decision
in
weil
v.
commissioner
which
seems
to
have
been
of
some
--
covered
it
length
in
the
briefs
and
that
is,
that
the
tax
court
held
in
weil
that
when
you
use
the
alternative
tax
computation,
you
can
not
take
an
ordinary
loss
and
net
it
against
your
capital
gain
segment.
now,
while
that
is
an
independent
sort
of
rule,
we
think
that
its
existence
and
a
fact
that
it
is
never
been
questioned,
is
instructive
for
the
issue
here
and
that
is
simply
fair
as
a
situation,
where
deductions
are
lost,
so
to
speak,
they
cannot
be
used,
but
this
is
simply
a
fact
that
congress
is
giving
with
one
hand,
the
benefits
of
the
25%
flat
rate
and
taking
something
away
with
the
other.
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
has
never
been
questioned
since.
we
think
here
the
same
rationale
applies.
yes,
there
is
a
loss
of
the
benefit
of
the
deduction
that
might
otherwise
be
available,
but
we
do
not
think
that
tax
law
concerns
itself
with
what
might
otherwise
be
available.
these
are
the
facts.
these
are
the
configurations
of
income
and
the
statutory
network
has
to
be
applied
in
its
prescribed
manner
and
we
think
when
it
is
applied
in
its
prescribed
manner,
the
answer
is
simply
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
right
and
that
the
tax
court
in
chartier
real
estate
company
was
wrong.
i
do
not
have
anything
further
to
say
unless
there
are
other
questions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
figuring
the
alternative
tax,
the
taxable
incomes
--
yes,
yes…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
taxable
income
is
statutory
term
and
taxable
income
we
submit
no
matter
how
you
view
it,
how
you
ever
parse
it
in
this
case,
is
$132,000.
that
is
what
the
tax
base
is
$166,000,
but
the
taxpayer’s
taxable
income
in
this
case,
no
matter
what
net
that
has
applied
is
a
$132,000.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
i
have
nothing
further.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
the
burr
on
the
saddle
or
the
only
in
our
view
--
it
is
really
the
only
exposition
of
the
problem
rejecting
our
position
and
we
think
that
it
pretty
much
rely
its
stands
on
two
prongs:
one
is
extrapolation
of
the
statute
or
essentially
saying
that
the
loss
is
carried
back
to
taxable
income
and
that
taxable
income
is
only
that
ordinary
income
segment.
we
think
that
is
wrong
as
a
statutory
matter.
and
the
other
thing
that
judge
raum
relied
on
is
this
rationale
which
was
expressed
by
the
court
in
libson
shops
vresus
koehler.
but
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
this
is
not
the
net
operating
loss
carryback
and
carryforward
provisions
are
not
fluid
system
to
enable
the
taxpayer
to
sort
of
use
a
loss,
to
hunt
around
for
a
place
where
it
will
do
some
benefit.
in
fact,
the
three
years
back
and
five
years
forward
is
essentially
a
statutory
system
designed
to
say
well
at
some
point
we
are
going
to
cut
if
off
these
benefits
and
reassert
the
strictures,
however
harsh
they
maybe
of
the
annual
accounting
system.
we
think
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
policy
here,
it
has
to
be
a
squared
with
the
detailed
rules
that
congress
prescribe
and
i
refer
the
court
to
its
three
decisions
in
woolford
realty
co.,
lewyt
and
olympic
radio
and
rio
motors
where
the
court
more
or
less
said
that
these
things
are
detailed
rules
and
they
have
to
be
prescribed
with
their
detailed
verbiage
and
indeed
in
rio
motors
their
loss
carryover
was
denied
basically
because
of
timing
and
while
that
may
sadden
the
particular
taxpayer
--
we
think
that,
that
is
really
a
question
for
congress
to
address
itself
and
not
for
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
is
the
service
endeavored
to
get
the
statute
clarified,
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
although
the
statute
has
been…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
has
been
seven
years
since
chartier
and
i
would
tell
the
court
that
the
statute
has
undergone
revisions
both
in
69
and
only
yesterday,
but
there
have
been
revisions
of
lengthening
the
carryback
year,
and
again,
i
think
these
revisions
demonstrate
that
congress
works
on
these
problems
in
detail
and
it
has
made
certain
decisions
as
how
to
alter
these
things
and
it
is
never
suggested
that,
there
has
never
been
any
suggestion
in
the
congress
that
the
tax
court’s
decision
in
chartier
was
a
correct
exposition
of
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
congress
has
been
sound
though.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
my
principal
occupation
is
litigation,
but…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
not
the
principal
occupation
of
the
treasury
department
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
legislative
effort
to
solve
this
problem.
this
problem
unfortunately
has
to
be
solved
by
this
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
temporarily,
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
in
fact
the
only,
the
only
new
piece
of
information
that
i
have
given
to
the
court
today
which
is
not
in
our
brief
is
that
article.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
two
final
points
and
this
is
my
brother
mr.
baker
has
described
in
great
length
this
array
of
decisions
rejecting
the
government’s
position,
but
when
stripping
all
that
away,
the
only
decision
that
comes,
that
attempted
in
detail
to
come
to
grips
with
the
our
position
was
the
tax
court’s
original
chartier
decision.
first
circuit
affirmed
per
curiam,
the
ninth
circuit
in
olympic
foundry
affirmed
per
curiam
on
the
authority
of
the
first
circuit,
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
although
it
rendered
a
more
lengthy
opinion,
when
that
opinion
is
analyzed
in
depth
all
it
did
was
followed
the
other
circuits
because
it
was
impressed
with
the
cumulative
weight
of
the
decision.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
perhaps,
although
we
would
submit
that
all
of
these
courts
were
wrong,
including
the
initial
decision,
as
far
as
the
administrative
history
of
pre
chartier,
i
enquired
at
the
internal
revenue
service
and
they
do
not
have
any
information
about
what
was
being
done
before,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
since
the
regulations
as
promulgated
in
1954,
support
the
position
that
we
are
taking…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
disagree
in
the
sense
that
i
suppose
i
would
say
that
the
language
of
the
statute
in
our
view,
prescribes
the
very
mathematical
tests
that…
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
regulations
do
not
add
anything.
they
do
not
add
anything
other
than
the
statute,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
revenue
agents,
we
have
no
information
that
they
were
doing
anything,
but
following
the
line.
there
is
no
information
at
all.
as
far
as
the
internal
revenue
service
communicating
its
view
as
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
decision
in
chartier
and
the
appeal
by
the
government
in
the
litigation
that
follows
more
than
suffice
to
communicate
to
the
private
tax
bar
of
the
government’s
view
that
the
tax
court
was
wrong
in
chartier
and
that
those
other
circuits
were
wrong
as
well.
