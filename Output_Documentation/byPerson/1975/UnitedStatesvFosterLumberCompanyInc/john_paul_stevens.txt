mr.
baker,
the
government
argues
that
precisely
the
same
thing
in
essence
would
have
happened
if
the
loss
that
occurred
in
1966,
the
same
year
in
which
the
capital
gain
occurred.
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument
as
long
as
nine
years
(inaudible)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
for
a
different
year
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
it
not
come
down
then
to
what
do
we
really
think
the
words
that
congress
use
mean.
shouldn't
we
not
just
net
our
cast
to
just
read
the
language
as
carefully
as
we
can?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
baker,
this
is
precisely
the
same
irrationality
as
the
distinction
between
the
same
year
and
the
different
year
situation.
no
one
could
give
a
hypothetical
example
showing
that
that
is
equally
illogical
and
it
does
seem
awfully
illogical,
i
have
to
agreeâ€¦
justice
john
paul
stevens
...because
the
language
is
unclear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
are
arguing
policy
--
and
what
seems
arbitrary
and
now
you
can
make
precisely
strong
an
argument?
