justice
harry
a.
blackmun
when
you
used
the
term
a
second
time
it
has
to
be,
no,
does
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
opposition
will
disagree
with
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
this
connection,
has
the
government’s
position
on
this
issue
always
been
what
it
is
today?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
tax
court
has
been
consistent
through
the
years
on
this,
has
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
the
other
hand
the
eighth
circuit
had
a
consistent
holding
on
the
tax
court
in
elsewhere?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
perhaps
that
is
a
little
more
persuasive
than
treasury
regulations.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
see
if
i
have
this
straight.
your
position
is
that
the
irrationality
of
the
government’s
posture
is
that
the
one
purpose
they
take
capital
gains
into
account,
for
the
other
they
do
not.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
reminds
me
of
the
badly
drawn
will,
one
can
make
arguments
either
way
and
there
is
illogic
on
both,
each
side
of
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
under
that
statute.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
reviewed
by
the
full
court,
chartier
was
not
as
i
recall.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
in
any
event
they
are
different
judges,
they
are
not
all
judged
wrong?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
have
filed
a
dissent
in
this
case
and
that
dissent
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
mr.
justice
powell.
this
case
was
argued
twice
and
it
is
now
decided
here
by
a
vie
before
vote
on
the
theory
that
a
net
operating
loss
incurred
by
the
taxpayer
and
allowed
under
the
statutes
to
be
carried
back
was
absorbed
and
i
put
that
word
in
quotes
or
to
use
the
government's
term
completely
absorbed
by
a
capital
gain
in
the
carry
back
year,
even
though
the
loss
could
not
be
set
off
against
that
gain.
there
are
two
policies
at
work
here,
both
of
them
favor
the
taxpayer,
neither
of
them
favors
the
government
and
yet
the
court
by
and
now
a
margin
comes
out
in
favor
of
the
government.
the
first
policy
is
the
congressional
policy
of
separating
the
taxation
of
capital
gains
on
the
one
hand
and
the
taxation
of
ordinary
income,
that
the
policy
of
course
in
to
encourage
investment
and
the
formation
of
capital.
i
feel
that
the
court's
opinion
today
serves
to
put
capital
gain
and
ordinary
income
together
and
thus,
to
defeat
this
congressional
policy.
the
second
policy
is
the
very
existence
of
the
carry
back
and
carryover
provisions.
its
purpose
of
course
is
ameliorate
the
effect
of
spasmatic
income
to
eliminate
the
peaks
and
valleys
of
income
at
a
corporation
or
an
individual
for
that
matter
maybe
experienced
because
of
our
system
of
reporting
and
paying
taxes
on
an
annual
basis.
i
think
this
policy
is
also
defeated
when
the
taxpayer
over
the
period
in
question
is
taxed
on
more
than
his
economic
gain
realized
during
that
period.
this
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
have
the
capital
gain
in
1966
been
sustained
in
1967,
there
would
be
no
problem.
similarly,
if
the
net
ordinary
income
of
1967
had
been
sustained
in
1966,
there
would
be
no
problem,
but
because
there
was
a
capital
gain,
this
taxpayer
by
pure
happen
snaps,
losses
the
benefit
of
both
policies
that
congress
has
undertaken
to
effect.
the
court
i
think
also
ignores
and
rides
russia
out
over
an
unbroken
line
of
decisions
elsewhere
originating
in
a
tax
court
and
participated
in,
in
successive
cases
by
recognized
judges.
this,
as
the
court
had
just
stated
orally,
is
a
very
complicated
and
detailed
area
of
the
law
and
if
ever
there
is
a
place
where
the
expertise
of
a
tax
court
should
be
given
difference,
it
is
in
this
case.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
the
decisions
in
the
district
courts
and
then
the
courts
of
appeals.
this
is
another
illustration
where
the
government
by
its
persistence
and
its
power
in
tax
matters,
and
lose
in
one
court
of
appeals
and
lose
in
the
second
court
of
appeals,
and
lose
in
the
third
court
of
appeals,
but
finally
go
to
a
fourth
and
pick
the
divided
decision,
create
a
conflict,
and
the
case
brought
here
and
we
have
a
five
to
four
decision.
i
disagree
emphatically
with
the
court's
statement
that
the
law
here
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
the
very
fact
that
so
many
able
judges
in
the
tax
court
and
in
the
district
courts
and
in
the
courts
of
appeals
decided
the
other
way,
i
think
against
the
light
of
that
time
of
reasoning.
it
has
been
said
that
taxation
is
a
practical
matter.
i
think
we
ignore
the
light's
precept
of
those
words
in
this
decision.
the
result
for
me
is
a
distressing
one
and
i
think
it
is
totally
wrong
and
therefore
i
intercept
it.
