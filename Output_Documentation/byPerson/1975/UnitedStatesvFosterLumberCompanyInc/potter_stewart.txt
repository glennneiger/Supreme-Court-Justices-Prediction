you
stated
the
issue
in
a
loaded
way
--
justice

yes,
i
know
you
are.

they
were
what,
affirmances
of
the
tax
court?
justice

in
the

case?
justice

which
came
after
the

case?
justice

and
in
which
the
united

court
relied
upon

justice

but
he
would
even
if
following
your
theory
he
would
have
if
the
figures
were
different?
justice

i
mean
another

might

it
is
not

that
a

there
is
nothing
new
about
the
proposition
that
the
internal
revenue
code
has
all
sorts
of
classification
as
it
resulted
in
any
individual
case
in
fortuitous
of
impact?
the
very
fact
that
you
are
limited
for
example
in
your
carry
over

carry
year,
three
years
back
and
five
years
forward,
leads
to
fortuitous
results
for
taxpayers
who
either
have,
again
whether
if
their
timing
is
wrong?
justice

stewart
if
the
carry
years
do
not
cover
their
loss,
for
example
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
fairly
fortuitous
as
to
the
arbitrary
three-year
back
and
five-year
forward
results
and
sometime
an
fortuitous
impact?
justice

stewart
is
it
not
the
key
phrase
in
your
submission
at

taxable
income,
and
technical
meaning
of
that?
justice

and
ask
you
this,
and
i
see
if
you
are
glad
about
this
one.
is
it
correct
that
if
a
taxpayer
has
a
lower
tax
by
use
of
the
alternative
method
that
he
must
use
that
method?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
no
option.
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
one
was
what,
the
weil
case
point?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
section
172
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
as
amended
provides
that
a
net
operating
loss
experienced
by
a
corporate
tax
payer
in
one
year
may
be
carried
as
a
deduction
to
the
preceding
three
years
and
the
succeeding
five
years
to
offset
a
taxable
income
of
those
years.
the
entire
loss
must
be
carried
to
the
earliest
possible
year,
and
any
of
the
loss
that
is
not
absorbed
by
that
fi'
dent
had
had
ordinary
income
of
about
$7,000.00
and
capital
gain
of
about
$167,000.00.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
loss
carryover
is
absorbed
by
capital
gain
as
well
as
ordinary
income,
or
is
instead
limited
to
offsetting
only
ordinary
income.
the
taxpayer,
the
foster
lumber
company
filed
a
refund
suit
on
the
federal
district
court
challenging
the
commissioner's
disallowance
of
its
claim
that
the
$35,000.00
of
the
1968
loss
not
used
or
set
is
a
1966
ordinary
income
survived
to
reduce
its
1967
tax
liability.
the
trial
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
agreed
with
the
tax
payer
and
re-granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
circuit
conflict
on
a
recurring
question
of
a
statutory
interpretation
in
a
field
of
law
into
the
internal
revenue
code
of
continuing
importance.
as
even
this
short
statement
of
the
case
makes
evident,
the
issues
to
be
decided
involved
complicated
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
that
do
not
lend
themselves
to
intelligible
oral
discussion.
suffice
it
to
say
that
for
the
reasons
spelled
out
in
some
detail
and
a
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
have
concluded
that
the
government
is
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
the
code
in
this
case.
accordingly,
the
judgment
before
us
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
