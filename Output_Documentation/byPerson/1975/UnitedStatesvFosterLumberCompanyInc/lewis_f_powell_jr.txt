so
when
you
say
it
was
used,
you
are
saying
it
just
disappeared

mr.
smith,
you
are
saying
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
majority
of
the
tax
court
was
irrational
in
interpreting
language
that
at
least
to
me
it
seems
ambiguous?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

the
tax
court
at
least
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
at
least
presumptively
its
rational
on
tax
matters,
have
arrived

mr.

justice

approaching
mr.
justice
white's
point
from
a
different
angle,
if
you
view
this
result
in
terms
of
economic
reality,
the
way
it
works
out
with
me
is
that
this
taxpayer
net
economic
gain
over
the
three-year
period
was
$361,000.00,
what
the
government
is
proposing
to
do
is
to
tax
$396,000.00.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
reverse
of
the
coin
you
have
just
conceded
and
that
is
that
you
are
not
giving
the
taxpayer
a
credit
for
$35,000.00
of
loss,
in
effect
you
are
taxing
him?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
statutes
that
you
are
talking
about
involve
two
basic
tax
approaches.
capital
gains
are
quite
different
from
ordinary
income.
capital
gains
are
often,
perhaps
usually,
the
product
of
accretion
over
periods
of
years,
and
if
capital
formation
in
this
country
is
to
be
encouraged,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
25%
alternative
tax,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
you
are
arguing
is
counter
productive
to
the
basic
theory
of
a
capital
gains
tax?
justice

f.
powell,

mr.
baker,
before
you
go
on,
prior
to
chartier
in
the
1969,
i
think
you
said
the
government
had
not
undertaken
any
interpretation
of
this
language
in
any
official
way.
how
was
the
tax
law
enforced
prior
to
69
with
foster
lumber
company
had
been
permitted
by
practice
of
the
irs
to
have
carried
the
loss
back
as
you
now
proposed
to
do?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
same
yearâ€¦
