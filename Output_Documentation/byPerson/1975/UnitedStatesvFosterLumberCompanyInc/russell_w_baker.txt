mr.
russell
w.
baker
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
by
its
questions
has
indicated
that
it
understands
the
government’s
real
position
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
its
position,
and
that
is
to
repeat,
that
under
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
net
operating
loss
of
the
taxpayer
is
to
be
wasted.
put
in
numbers,
this
means
that
that
part
of
the
capital
gain
we
received
in
1966,
which
absorbed
the
loss,
is
really
taxed
at
a
73%
rate
in
this
manner.
25%
for
an
alternative
tax,
48%
by
reason
of
the
failure
to
allow
us
to
carry
it
against
ordinary
income
of
another
year,
disregarding
surtax
exemptions.
and
today
with
the
alternative
tax
rate
on
corporation
at
30%,
instead
of
the
25%
which
existed
in
the
late
60s,
that
rate
--
that
total
effective
rate
would
be
78%.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
i
believe
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
language
is
clear
you
are
obliged
to
ignore
the
policy.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
first
of
all
and
primarily,
we
rely
upon
the
same
analysis
used
by
the
tax
court,
and
that
is
the
sentence
in
question
is
capable
of
being
read
that
to
which
the
loss
may
be
carried,
modifies
taxable
income.
here
is
where
the
eight
circuit
below
agreed
with
the
tax
court.
it
said
either
reading
of
the
--
of
this
sentence
is
plausible,
to
use
its
exact
words,
this
phrase
could
modify
taxable
income
or
it
could
modify
the
years,
the
earlier
taxable
years.
and
if
there
were
no
doubt
about
this,
if
--
then
we
would
have
to
fall
back
on
alternative
arguments.
if
the
court
found
that
the
modified
phrase
did
not
modify
taxable
income
at
all,
we
would
have
had
alternative
arguments,
but
we
chose
to
place
our
argument
on
the
ground
used
by
the
tax
court
that
there
was
an
ambiguity.
the
tax
court
--
mr.
russell
w.
baker
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
tax
court
first
ruled
in
1969,
since
then
it
has
a
couple
of
more
cases,
involving
the
same
question,
and
as
late
as
last
year
it
said,
“we
remain
convinced
of
the
soundness
of
the
chartier
decision.”
that
decision
did
take
on,
unlike
almost
any
other
case
we
have,
did
take
on
both
prongs
of
this
problem.
the
taxpayer
is
first
asked
to
carry
back
his
loss
and
take
it
against
the
capital
gain,
thus
raising
problem,
which
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
white.
could
he
take
it
against
the
capital
gain?
the
tax
court
examined
the
alternative
tax
provisions
very
clearly
and
said
it
is
unmistakable,
you
cannot
do
it,
congress
has
just
said
so.
so
no,
the
answer
is
no,
you
cannot
take
it
there.
the
taxpayer’s
alternative
was
i
should
like
to
carry
the
loss
over
to
the
next
year
since
i
could
not
use
it
in
the
capital
gain
here.
the
tax
court
here
turned
to
the
loss
provisions
of
the
code
and
found
under
the
sentence
that
we
were
discussing,
that
he
could
carry
the
loss
on
to
the
next
year.
so
the
tax
court
had
both
--
both
things
before
it.
it
upheld
its
wild
option
that
it
cannot
reduce
the
capital
gain,
but
it
allowed
the
carry
over
to
the
next
year
and
did
not
therefore
require
the
taxpayer
to
waste
his
net
operating
loss.
now,
the
unusual
feature
of
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
government
will
readily
concede
to
this
court,
that
a
capital
gain
in
some
of
the
eight
possible
carry
years
will
not
affect
the
matter
at
all.
in
a
few
cases
like
ours,
where
the
capital
gain
comes
early
in
the
carry
period,
then
we
are
required
under
the
government’s
position
to
waste
our
loss,
but
if
the
capital
gain
is
delayed
far
enough
in
this
total
eight-year
period,
so
that
ordinary
income
can
accumulate
to
absorb
the
loss,
then
the
taxpayer
gets
both,
the
use
of
his
loss
and
the
favorable
capital
gains
rate.
so,
it
is
a
matter
of
timing
within
the
carry
period.
this
matter
of,
and
when
i
say
a
matter
of
timing,
i
am
talking
about
timing
within
the
eight
possible
carry
years.
the
discrimination
between
taxpayers
within
that
period
under
the
government’s
position
is
based
on
no
policy
whatever.
it
is
wholly
fortuitous,
the
order
in
which
--
mr.
russell
w.
baker
i
agree
with
your
comment
entirely
--
mr.
russell
w.
baker
i
agree
with
your
comment
entirely.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
certainly,
it
is.
i
do
not
claim
that
if
it
is
the
job
of
this
court
to
straighten
out
all
of
the
angles
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
as
you
say,
we
cannot
carry
a
loss
back
more
than
three-years,
or
we
cannot
carry
it
over
more
than
five-years.
the
reason
we
have
stressed
this,
as
the
courts
below
did
is,
if
the
court
finds
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
this
language
and
it
is
not
quite
clear
what
congress
was
doing,
then
it
is
in
order
for
the
court
to
look
to
the
consequences
in
order
to
select
between
competing
interpretations.
foster,
to
continue
this
line
of
thought
for
one
moment
more,
foster
must
in
this
ambiguous
area
waste
its
net
operating
loss.
but
if
it
has
a
competitor
across
the
street,
identical
in
every
respect
to
it,
except
one
and
that
is
that
its
capital
loss
came
one
year
later,
two
years
before
the
net
operating
loss,
that
competitor
gets
the
capital
gain
rate,
gets
to
use
its
net
operating
loss,
but
under
the
government’s
position
we
do
not.
again,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
this
is
commanded
by
congress,
we
have
to
live
with
it.
we
have
tried
to
assist
the
court
on
this
very
point
by
including
in
our
brief
at
page
25,
a
table
which
shows
the
consequences
of
the
government’s
position.
now,
this
is
not
a
table
with
assumed
specific
dollars
in
it.
it
is
just
a
plain
statement
of
what
happens
to
a
net
operating
loss
when
it
encounters
a
capital
gain
in
each
of
the
eight
carry
years.
and
it
states
the
government
what
happens
under
the
government’s
position
and
what
happens
under
our
position,
and
therefore,
we
hope
effectively,
points
up
the
point
we
are
trying
to
make
in
this
regard.
we
should
say
something
because
this
is
our
opportunity
to
reply
to
the
government’s
reply
brief.
mr.
justice
powell
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
the
--
that
the
amount
the
government
proposes
to
tax
us
on
in
the
period
is
$396,000.00,
instead
of
the
$361,000.00.
the
government
strenuously
contests
this
point
in
its
reply
brief.
at
page
eight,
they
say
and
i
read
from
the
government’s
reply
brief
at
page
eight,
“respondent
and
the
amicus
further
argue
that
the
government’s
position
with
tax
respondent
on
a
total
of
$396,000.00
for
the
three-year
period
’66–’68,
although
respondent’s
aggregate
income
for
the
period
was
$361,000.00.”
a
careful
analysis
of
the
figures
demonstrates
that
this
statement
is
simply
inaccurate.
our
response
is
our
statement
is
accurate.
the
government’s
error
is
plain
in
this
regard
and
as
pointed
up
by
the
statement
on
the
next
page,
page
nine,
where
the
statement
is
made
computing
the
tax,
and
it
is
underlined,
on
the
same
$132,000.00
of
taxable
income,
but
by
the
alternative
method
provided
in
section
1201,
produce
the
lower
tax
of
$41,000.00.
as
in
the
exchange
with
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it
was
brought
out
clearly
to
the
court
that
the
alternative
tax
was
on
the
total
$167,000.00
of
capital
gain.
the
government
in
its
point
one
and
its
reply
brief
says
the
statute
is
clear.
of
course,
if
the
statute
is
clear
and
the
congress
commands
us
to
do
as
the
government
indicates,
we
lose.
we
have
felt
that
our
ambiguity
in
the
statute
is
demonstrated
by
the
opinions
of
the
lower
court
and
that
the
consequences
we
have
pointed
out
are
important
and
should
be
considered
by
this
court.
the
fact
is
that
the
government
is
asking
for
such
an
unusual
out
of
the
ordinary
result
here
that
it
had
seemed
to
us
that
they
should
be
able
to
point
to
some
indication
by
congress,
that
it
knew,
it
was
enacting
the
result,
which
they
have
asked
for.
the
fact
is
that
over
the
years,
neither
congress
has
indicated
that
nor
more
importantly
has
the
internal
revenue
service
indicated
to
congress
that
it
was
taking
an
administrative
position
that
would
yield
such
a
result
as
they
ask
for
today.
and
this
problem
has
been
with
us
for
a
long
enough
time
for
a
some
kind
of
administrative
position
to
have
been
communicated
to
congress
on
this
point,
yet
i
think
there
is
none.
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
and
also
this
morning
states,
the
taxpayer
result
would
have
been
impossible
under
the
39
code.
we
do
not
agree.
we
think
our
result
could
have
been
possible
under
the
39
code
for
a
couple
of
reasons
if
not
more.
certainly
the
same
policy
factors
were
acting
under
the
39
code
as
are
acting
today.
the
merrill
case
cited
by
the
north
river
amicus
brief,
is
a
clear
indication
that
the
courts
could
have
easily
reached
our
result
under
the
39
code.
second
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
the
existence
of
the
treasury
regulation
under
the
39
code,
which
says,
net
operating
loss
is
available
except
to
the
extent
absorbed
by
the
taxable
income
of
earlier
years.
now,
the
word
“absorbed”
surely
has
some
overtone
of
usefully
applied.
congress
would
have
been
looking
at
that
regulation,
we
may
assume,
when
it
enacted
the
1954
internal
revenue
code,
at
which
time,
as
the
government’s
counsel
has
pointed
out,
this
whole
section
was
rewritten,
lots
more
was
done
to
it
than
merely
add
the
phrase
“to
which
the
loss
may
be
carried,”
which
has
so
emphasized.
it
would
be
entirely
within
the
realm
of
possibility
for
that
phrase
to
have
been
added
as
a
matter
of
clarification.
congress
could
have
well
felt
or
whatever
draftsman
was
acting
for
congress
could
have
well
felt,
that
he
was
simply
continuing
a
computational
rule
which
had
there
to
fore
existed.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
respondent
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
and
in
effect
the
views
of
the
tax
court
for
the
reasons
that
are
presented
in
our
brief
and
here
this
morning.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
real
position
to
us
is
this;
that
our
net
operating
loss
is
to
be
wasted
in
our
circumstances.
it
is
a
different
way
of
putting
it
than
we
have
been
charged
with
in
the
argument
which
was
just
concluded.
now,
i
mean
by
wasted
that
it
cannot
be
used
to
offset
income
in
another
year,
income
which
was
taxed
to
48%.
the
government
says
and
it
made
a
very
clear
statement
of
its
case
that
the
capital
gain
in
1966
on
which
we
paid
tax
is
deem
to
absorb
our
loss,
leaving
it
unavailable
for
use
in
the
following
year.
the
consequences
that
our
net
part
of
the
capital
gain
which
absorbed
loss,
we
pay
effectively
73%
in
taxes.
a
25%
capital
gains
tax
and
48%
by
not
being
able
to
use
the
loss
in
the
following
year.
now,
today
in
1976,
were
the
problem
to
arise,
the
alternative
tax
now
being
30%,
the
compounded
effect
desired
by
the
government
would
be
30
plus
48
or
78%.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
situation
is
what
i
often
call
the
same
year’s
situation
and
it
is
the
situation
where
a
deficit
in
ordinary
income
occurs
in
the
same
year
that
one
has
a
large
capital
gain
and
the
weil
case
which
has
been
much
mooted
in
arguments
before
this
court
says,
as
it
said
in
1954
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
been
uniformed
with
1956.
it
says
that,
"if
it
occurs
in
the
same
year,
the
one
does
not
offset
the
other.
the
full
capital
gain
must
be
taxed
under
the
alternative
method
and
there
is
no
reduction
offered
by
reason
of
the
deficit
in
ordinary
income."
now,
the
tax
court
has
looked
at
this
and
it
is
found
that
the
directions
in
the
alternative
tax
statute
on
this
very
point
are
unqualified
and
has
no
choice.
this
is
what
the
unqualified
directions
of
the
statute
say
and
therefore,
there
is
no
reduction
in
tax
there,
and
i
see
a
further
question
perhaps
on
your
face
or
in
your
mind
and
that
is,
in
such
case
is
there
a
net
operating
loss
to
be
carried
over
to
another
year.
the
answer
is
there
is
not
because
subsection
(c)
and
(d)
of
the
statute
tell
just
exactly
how
that
is
to
be
computed,
so
that
in
the
same
year
situation,
one
must
agree,
that
the
loss
disappears,
it
does
a
vanishing
act.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
policies
that
have
moved
congress
to
this
are
beyond
my
powers
to
detail
to
you,
but
may
i
say,
that
since
1918
when
the
prototype
of
the
net
operating
loss
statute
came
into
our
laws,
that
congress
has
ever
since
then
provided
a
different
method
of
calculating
the
loss
in
the
same
year
than
it
has
in
the
carry
year.
they
have
put
a
certain
threshold
on
taxpayers
which
taxpayers
must
need
in
order
to
have
in
net
operating
loss,
but
once
they
pass
that
threshold,
then
congress
has
always
provided
other
casts
in
the
carry
years
to
see
how
much
or
what
would
be
absorbed.
the
policy
implications
of
that,
i
cannot
explain.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
yes
and
that
is
of
course
the
task
of
the
court
in
this
case.
what
is
the
taxable
income
of
each
of
the
prior
taxably
years
to
which
such
loss
maybe
carried?
the
tax
court
found
that
to
which
such
loss
maybe
carried,
results
in
a
favorable
result
to
the
taxpayer
here
because
it
said,
it
modifies
taxable
income.
the
taxable
income
to
which
it
maybe
carried
and
in
that
case,
since
in
our
case,
the
loss
had
not
been
carried
against
our
capital
gain
at
$35,000
not
so
carried
was
available
for
a
carryover
to
another
year.
so,
of
course
it
is
the
interpretation
of
that
sentence
of
the
statute,
but
may
it
please
the
court,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
perhaps
a
little
more
than
an
exercise
in
a
merely
reading
a
sentence.
it
perhaps
requires
the
court
to
examine
the
consequences
of
these
interpretations.
if
it
finds
the
statute
at
all
ambiguous
to
determine
--
and
the
consequences
may
tell
the
court
some
significant
things
about
the
possible
intent
of
congress.
i
should
like
to
follow
the
government’s
argument
in
describing
the
chartier
case
which
is
the
one
which
started
this
all
off
in
1969.
it
maybe
noted
that
the
government
had
not
for
many
years
before
that
and
we
have
taken
an
administrative
position
on
this
point,
but
it
did
take
a
litigating
position
in
chartier.
consequently
the
tax
court
was
the
first
court
that
got
to
speak
on
the
problem.
there,
as
in
our
case,
the
taxpayer
had
a
loss
which
he
would
carry
to
a
year
that
had
ordinary
income
and
capital
gain
in
it.
the
loss
wiped
up
the
ordinary
income
but
then
there
was
some
still
left
and
in
his
first
petition,
the
taxpayer
said,
“may
i
take
this
against
the
capital
gain
in
computing
the
alternative
tax?”
the
tax
court
said,
“no”,
and
as
i
was
indicating
in
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
an
unqualified
direction
in
the
statute
to
that
affect.
the
taxpayer
then
said
“may
i
then
carryover
my
loss
to
the
next
year
and
use
it
to
reduce
the
ordinary
income
of
that
year
to
the
extent,
that
there
is
some?”
the
government
objected
but
over
that
objection,
the
tax
court
allowed
this
saying
that
the
statute,
the
law
statute,
permitted
this
treatment.
now,
the
chartier
court
is
the
only
court
which
has
had
two
petitions
before
it
at
the
same
time
which
it
was
confronted
with
both
of
these
questions.
it
answered
the
first
one
in
favor
of
the
government
and
the
second
one
for
the
taxpayer
and
it
is
the
second
one
that
the
government
today
wants
overturn
by
this
court.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
yes
your
honor,
the
weil
case,
it
is
--
one
could
say
it
is
the
weil
case
all
over
again,
but
one
also
could
say
it
was
the
first
time
that
a
court
said,
“weil
applies
in
the
carry
year,”
but
it
is
in
effect
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
law
doctrine
in
this
first
one.
we
should
like
the
court
to
take
note
of
certain
irrationalities
which
we
think
are
introduced
by
the
government’s
position.
the
government
has
to
admit
notwithstanding
its
argument
against
cumulating
benefits,
the
government
has
to
admit
that
in
many
cases,
a
taxpayer
may
use
his
net
operating
loss
fully
and
also
have
the
favorable
rate
on
the
capital
gain.
what
they
claim
is
that
in
a
few
cases
where
the
capital
gain
comes
early
in
the
prescribed
eight
year
period,
the
absorption
without
tax
benefit
may
take
place,
but
they
have
to
admit
that
if
the
capital
gain
comes
a
little
later
in
this
prescribed
eight
year
period,
giving
enough
time
for
ordinary
income
to
accumulate
in
the
first
year
or
two,
the
loss
will
be
applied
against
that
ordinary
income,
the
favorable
rate
will
be
available
on
the
capital
gains.
so,
it
is
really
a
matter
of
accident
within
the
prescribed
period
under
the
government’s
position.
they
would
treat
the
foster
class
of
taxpayers
in
a
fluctuating
fashion.
some
would
have
all
of
their
loss
allowed,
some
part
of
it,
some
get
none
of
their
loss
allowed.
what
this
means
to
someone
like
respondent
foster
lumber
company
is
that
according
to
the
government,
foster
lumber
must
waste
$35,000
of
its
net
operating
loss
because
its
capital
gain
occurred
in
the
first
of
the
possible
years
whereas
its
competitor
across
the
street,
identical
in
every
way
to
foster
lumber
company,
can
get
the
net
operating
loss
and
get
the
favorable
rate
on
its
taxable
gain
if
only
one
thing
is
different
and
that
is
if
the
loss
occurred
in
the
second
of
the
possible
--
that
the
capital
gain
occurred
in
the
second
or
later
of
the
possible
years.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
your
honor,
if
there
is
ordinary…
mr.
russell
w.
baker
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
not
quite
correct…
mr.
russell
w.
baker
that,
with
respect,
would
not
be
true
in
our
case.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
with
respect
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
there
are
cases
where
it
cannot
be
deducted
and
i
would
suggest
this
to
you
that
if
in
the
first
year
there
is
only
capital
gain,
the
tax
that
the
alternative
tax
right
and
in
the
next
year
then
there
is
ordinary
income,
the
loss
carries
back
as
absorbed
to
that
tax
benefit
and
under
the
government’s
position
cannot
be
used
in
the
second
year.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
yes,
under
their
position.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
yes.
they
say
that
absorbs
the
loss
and
our
position
is
it
does
not.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
that
would
be
one
way
of
putting
it
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
i
understand
that.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
that
is
certainly
a
way
of
putting
it
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
i
quite
agree
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
same
year
situation
is
also
illogical,
but
taxpayers
have
no
argument
there
under
the
tax
(voice
overlap)...
mr.
russell
w.
baker
...because
the
language
is
clear.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
you
could
indeed
mr.
justice
stevens
and
it
is
something
that
some
day
when
congress
has
time
to
think
about
things
like
that,
then
perhaps
it
will
take
care
of.
it
might
be
other
systems
on
the
point
we
are
making
and
if
there
is
any
question
in
the
court’s
mind
about
the
discrimination
between
taxpayers
of
the
foster
class
to
refer
the
court
again
to
the
table
on
page
25
of
our
brief.
this
tells
what
happens
to
the
taxpayers
in
a
way
that
exposition
can
hardly
do.
it
gives
a
general
overview
of
the
full
nine
year
period
involved,
not
with
numbers,
but
with
a
plain
statement
of
what
happens
to
a
net
operating
loss,
when
if
it
encounters
the
capital
gain
in
any
one
of
the
eight
carry
years.
it
states
the
government’s
position
and
our
position
for
each
year.
an
examination
of
that
table
will
show
that
the
government’s
position
gives
eight
different
results
in
the
carry
years
depending
upon
the
timing
of
the
capital
gain,
whereas
our
position
gives
a
consistent
result
in
all
eight
carry
years
regardless
of
the
year
in
which
the
capital
gain
falls.
now,
we
have
included
this
table
for
the
reason
that
if
this
court
discerns
that
one
interpretation
of
the
statute
gives
a
crazy
quilt
pattern
to
taxpayers
in
this
situation
and
another
interpretation
gives
rise
to
a
rational
pattern,
we
think
the
court
will
no
doubt
consider
those
results
in
selecting
between
the
two
interpretations.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
a
judgment
for
us
would
certainly
contribute
to
the
predictability
of
the
situation.
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
the
government
filed
a
reply
brief
just
before
the
hearing
last
year.
we
have
filed
nothing
in
writing.
it
was
brought
out
in
question
by
mr.
justice
stewart
with
regard
since
that
time.
i
should
therefore
like
to
comment
briefly,
on
certain
points,
on
the
points
made
in
that
reply
brief.
first,
the
government
there
said
as
it
has
said
again
today
that
the
statute
is
clear
and
that
policy
and
consequences
should
play
little,
if
any,
part.
now,
on
this
question
of
whether
the
government’s
reading
of
the
statute
is
plain
and
clear
as
it
insists,
we
think
reference
should
be
made
to
the
period
during
which
it
has
been
litigating
the
question
and
the
results
it
has
obtained.
perhaps
i
am
repeating
here,
but
i
think
it
is
worthy
of
emphasis
that
which
was
brought
out
on
a
question
by
the
court.
the
government
took
its
first
position
in
chartier
and
lost
in
1969
and
as
the
government
counsel
indicated,
it
had
fought
for
five
years
in
the
courts
of
this
country
to
get
a
conflicting
decision,
and
for
five
years
the
courts
continued
to
rule
without
a
dissenting
vote
that
the
language
was
either
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
or
was
at
least
ambiguous,
and
they
all
ruled
to
the
taxpayer.
not
until
the
mutual
assurance
case
was
handed
down
by
the
fourth
circuit
by
a
two
to
one
vote
that
it
obtained
the
conflicting
decision
that
enabled
the
case
to
be
brought
here.
in
view
of
that
history,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
accept
the
government’s
assertion
that
the
reading
of
this
statute
is
that
plain
and
clear.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
more
fair
to
say
that
we
are
in
an
area
of
genuine
dispute
and
we
can
look
not
only
at
the
tax
court
for
a
serious
opinion,
but
also
at
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
the
eighth
circuit.
the
eighth
circuit
found
both
readings
of
the
statute
to
be
equally
plausible,
but
it
selected
the
one
that
favored
the
taxpayer
because,
it
said,
“it
was
supported
by
the
basic
policy
considerations
underlying
sections
1201
and
172.”
we
think
the
court
should
realize
that
during
the
many
years
that
the
government
says
this
question
has
been
open,
the
government
never
before
chartier
took
a
public
position
on
it.
the
examples
in
its
regulations
carefully
avoid
the
problem.
the
regulations
are
in
effect
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
does
not
advance
the
inquiry
very
much.
the
examples
might
have
held,
but
there
is
no
example
in
the
regulations
which
helps
resolve
this
issue.
the
irs
never
published
a
ruling
on
this
point.
in
other
words,
it
never
communicated
to
congress
or
to
the
public,
any
intimation
of
a
view
that
losses
could
be
absorbed
by
taxed
capital
gains.
perhaps
this
is
why
congress
has
never
seen
fit
to
clarify
what
now
as
a
matter
of
controversy
before
this
court.
i
should
like
to
reply
now
to
the
government’s
assertion
that
the
taxpayer
would
not
have
prevailed
under
the
provisions
of
the
1939
code.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
if
i
knew
the
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
powell,
i
would
gladly
give
it
you.
i
imagine
that
the
practice
was
variable.
i
do
not
think
the
government
can
state
with
any
confidence
that
the
practice
was
uniformly
its
way.
for
example,
prior
to
1954
or
as
you
corrected
me
perhaps
1956,
the
date
of
the
weil
decision,
it
may
not
have
even
been
clear
to
taxpayers
that
they
could
not
deduct
it
from
their
capital
gain,
so
they
may
have
been
taking
it
there
until
the
weil
decision…
mr.
russell
w.
baker
in
the
same
year
until
that
came
about.
beyond
the
weil
decision,
i
do
not
know
what
taxpayers
were
doing.
i
think
it
is
normal
practice
for
accountants
and
tax
advisers
of
corporations
to
advice
their
corporations
where
there
is
doubt
about
a
matter
to
take
to
report
it
and
favorably
to
themselves.
the
government
did
say
with
respect
to
the
39
code,
had
a
similar
situation
risen
under
that
code,
the
taxpayer
would
have
lost.
that
in
1954,
when
the
code
section
was
rewritten,
the
addition
of
the
words
to
which
such
loss
maybe
carried,
they
admit
they
were
added
at
that
time,
but
they
say,
they
have
no
significance
because
the
committee
reports
did
not
bring
out
what
the
addition
of
these
words
was
intended
to
do.
we
do
not
see
any
basis
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
answer
to
the
last
question,
we
do
not
see
any
bases
for
the
government’s
assertion
that
the
taxpayer
would
not
have
prevailed
under
the
39
code.
there
is
no
decided
case
to
that
affect.
there
is
no
ruling
to
that
affect.
the
same
policy
factors
were
acting
then
as
now
and
there
is
a
case
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
north
river
insurance
company,
merrill
against
the
united
states
which
shows
how
the
term
'net
income',
the
term
used
instead
of
taxable
income
in
the
39
code,
could
have
been
construed
so
as
to
avoid
the
unnecessary
wasting
of
the
loss.
and
when
the
government
asserts
that
the
addition
in
1954,
the
very
words
relied
on
the
tax
court
are
of
no
significance
because
the
committee
reports
did
not
say
anything
about
it,
we
feel
that
hardly
need
to
reply.
surely
silence
in
the
committee
reports
cannot
properly
be
used
to
advance
that
argument.
we
have
analyzed
the
'54
rewrite
and
we
have
put
the
committee
report
side-by-side
with
them
and
we
find
at
least
two
conspicuous
changes
made
in
section
172
other
than
this
one,
which
were
not
commented
upon
committee
reports.
so,
i
do
not
think
the
government
should
attempt
to
make
too
much
out
of
a
decision
by
a
congressional
committee
to
comment
only
upon
those
changes
which
they
deem
of
general
importance
to
large
classes
of
taxpayers,
but
there
is
one
aspect
of
the
congressional
history
of
the
net
operating
loss
provision
which
we
would
like
to
remind
the
court
of.
during
the
early
new
deal
years,
there
was
no
net
operating
loss
provision.
the
government
needed
the
revenue
to
badly
to
have
one.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
that
is
one
way
of
putting
it
your
honor.
in
that
case
i
would
have
retreated
to
the
arguments
of
the
merrill
case,
case
which
i
cited
and
argue
of
the
policy
factors
in
the
construction
of
the
word
net
income
as
that
appeared
in
the
1939
code.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
the
revenue
act
in
1939
introduced
the
modern
net
operating
loss
provision
and
it
allowed
two
years
in
which
you
could
carry
a
loss.
if
you
could
not
get
your
loss
absorbed
in
those
two
years,
it
was
gone
forever.
since
then,
they
have
been
expanding
this
period.
we
think
that
has
significance.
there
is
only
one
reason
why
you
expand
the
period
for
using
losses
and
that
so
you
can
use
them,
so
they
will
not
die
and
be
wasted.
in
1942,
they
expanded
the
period
to
four
years.
in
1950,
they
expanded
the
period
to
six
years.
in
1954,
to
seven
years,
in
1958
to
eight
years
and
yesterday
when
the
president
signed
the
tax
bill,
they
had
by
the
1976
law
expanded
it
to
ten
years
for
the
carryover
of
a
net
operating
loss.
we
say
this
record
exhibits
a
great
and
increasing
concern
by
congress
that
net
operating
losses
be
used
and
not
be
wasted.
i
would
turn
now
to
a
point
which
can
strongly
affect
one’s
view
of
the
merits
of
this
case.
in
our
brief
we
showed
that
under
the
government’s
position,
foster
would
be
taxed
on
$396,000
over
the
three-year
period,
whereas
everyone
agrees
that
the
aggregate
taxable
income
for
the
period
is
$361,000.
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
says,
we
are
wrong
about
this.
foster
was
not
taxed
on
more
than
$361,000.
the
dispute
traces
to
one
computation,
the
alternative
tax
in
1966
was
25%
of
the
capital
gain
of
a
$167,000.
it
is
agreed
that
ordinary
income
was
erased
by
the
loss
carryback,
leaving
only
25%
capital
gains
tax
to
be
paid.
if
you
multiply
a
$167,000
by
25%,
you
get
the
tax
of
41,000
which
we
paid.
so,
we
say
that
$167,000
of
capital
gains
has
been
taxed.
the
government
reply
brief
says
otherwise.
it
says
computing
the
tax
on
a
$132,000
of
taxable
income
by
the
alternative
method,
produced
the
tax
of
$41,000.
is
that
true?
it
does
not
sound
right.
you
take
25%
of
$132,000
and
by
ordinary
arithmetic
take
that
yields
a
tax
in
the
neighborhood
of
$33,000.
so
the
$41,000
which
we
paid
is
the
25%
tax
on
a
$167,000
capital
gain,
as
we
argued.
to
say
that
it's
a
tax
on
a
$132,000
is
plainly
not
so.
the
government
brief
does
not
show
any
explanation,
metaphysical
or
otherwise
to
account
for
the
inaccuracy.
so,
we
submit
again
as
we
did
in
our
basic
brief,
that
fosters
have
been
taxed
on
$167,000
of
capital
gain
in
1966.
and
if
we
must
waste
our
loss
as
the
government
contends,
we
will
be
taxed
on
$396,000
over
the
three-year
period.
in
the
end,
the
government’s
attempt
to
force
a
wasting
of
loss
in
our
circumstances
is
based
more
than
anything
else
on
its
often
repeated
insistence
regarding
the
meaning
of
the
word
'carried',
as
it
appears
in
the
sentence
of
the
statute.
if
any
court
is
qualified
by
close
contact
with
the
internal
revenue
code
to
pass
upon
the
meaning
of
the
word
'carried'
that
should
be
the
tax
court.
we
have
mentioned
throughout
this
argument,
its
pioneer
decision
in
the
chartier
case
in
1969,
the
tax
court
has
adhered
to
its
reading
of
the
word
'carried'
in
subsequent
decisions.
as
recently
as
1974,
in
the
continental
equities
case,
it
declined
the
government’s
request
to
reconsider
chartier
and
said,
“we
remain
convinced
of
the
soundness
of
chartier
and
follow
it
in
this
case.”
may
it
please
the
court?
mr.
russell
w.
baker
i
believe,
not
to
my
knowledge
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
russell
w.
baker
that
is
correct
your
honor.
only
judge
raum
wrote
chartier
and
another
judge
wrote
continental
equities
and
the
other
cases
which
followed.
may
it
please
the
court;
respondent
asks
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
reasons
mentioned
in
our
brief
and
here
today.
