mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
enter
into
my
argument
proper,
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
comments
on
mrs.
de
rodon’s
introduction.
first
of
all,
in
the
matter
of
no
showing
of
eligibility,
the
fact
is
and
this
is
a
fact
in
both
these
cases
that
these
plaintiffs
are
completely
eligible
for
unconditional
licenses
as
engineers,
except
for
the
requirement
citizenship,
they
have
met
every
single
other
requirement
under
section
689
of
title
xx.
secondly,
the
matter
of
the
multiplicity
of
civil
rights
actions
in
puerto
rico,
i
think
that
is
a
wonderful
thing,
not
a
terrible
thing.
it
shows
i
think
her
statistics
show
and
prove
the
great
need
in
puerto
rico
for
the
statute.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
that
is
true.
in
any
case,
though
i
think
this
court
is
faced
with
a
constitutional
question
of
the
first
order,
the
effect
of
denying
--
of
accepting
the
commonwealth's
argument
in
this
case
is
to
deny
the
3
million
citizens
of
the
united
states'
resident
in
puerto
rico,
coverage
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
is
denial
against
violations
of
the
rights
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
only
it
will
have
to
be
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
as
a
federal
question,
yes.
well,
that
is
where
the
first
limitation
is
the
jurisdiction
of
amount
of
course.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
it
might
be.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
briefs
thinks
that
--
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
i
think,
i
could
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
raised
in
a
federal
question,
yes.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
of
course.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
no,
no.
the
court
is
faced
with
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
yeah,
but
the
scope
of
section
1983
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
i
understand
it,
it
does
not
apply
per
se
to
the
territories.
it
was
applied
to
territories
in
1874
through
section
1983.
the
main
contention
of
the
commonwealth
in
this
case
is
that
under
this
court’s
decision
in
district
of
columbia
versus
carter,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
section
1334.
they
try
to
raise
a
syllogism
in
this
case.
they
say
that
the
district
of
columbia
was
found
to
be
sui
generis
in
the
constitutional
scheme
and
that
puerto
rico
is
ejusdem
generis
in
the
constitutional
scheme.
they
say
under
the
carter,
the
civil
rights
act
was
found
not
to
apply,
therefore,
it
does
not
apply
in
puerto
rico.
i
think
this
is
a
false
syllogism.
in
carter,
this
court
was
also
faced
with
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
what
was
the
scope
of
section
1983?
in
trying
to
find
this
scope,
it
went
back
to
the
old
case
of
puerto
rico
versus
the
shell
company
where
it
stated
that
it
was
the
character
and
aim
of
a
statute
which
serves
to
define
the
terms
of
the
statute,
specifically
in
carter
the
scope
of
the
term
state
or
territory
and
the
court
asked,
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
1874
amendment
to
section
1983?
and
it
found
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
amended
the
civil
rights
act
to
extend
the
fourteenth
amendment
protection
to
the
territories
acting
under
article
4
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
territorial
power.
the
reasons
for
this,
that
is
like
reasons
for
congress
in
passing
this
amendment
were
that
it
had
experienced
certain
difficulty
in
controlling
what
were
then
far
flung
territories
and
congress
had
delegated
some
of
its
lawmaking
powers
to
territorial
legislators.
therefore,
these
two
factors
combined
to
make
the
territories
more
like
states
in
so
far
as
problems
of
civil
rights
jurisdiction
were
concerned.
therefore,
they
equated
territories
with
states
in
so
far
as
section
1983
was
concerned.
the
district
of
columbia
on
the
other
hand
in
that
case
was
found
to
be
under
the
direct
control
and
supervision
of
congress.
it
is
the
seat
of
national
government.
therefore,
the
reasons
that
congress
had
in
extending
fourteenth
amendment
protection
to
the
territories
did
not
exist
in
the
case
of
the
district
columbia.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
no,
on
the
contrary,
under
shell
company,
it
would
have
to
have
apply,
it
would
have
have
--
would
have
been
held
to
apply
had
the
issue
been
raised
to
pre
1952
puerto
rico.
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
that.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
my
contention
is
that
it
has
not.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
because
puerto
rico
in
1952
gained
a
certain
amount
of
autonomy
and
it
is
this
autonomy
which
has
made
it
more
like
a
state.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
well,
it
is
true
in
any
of
the
territories.
in
other
words,
congress
can
act
in
puerto
rico
under
article
4
and
correct
whatever
grievances
it
may
think
need
correcting.
this
is
both
before
and
after
1952.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
yes,
calero-toledo
recognized
or
that
in
amending
section
1983,
congress
was
acting
under
article
4,
but
except
in
that
same
footnote
it
states
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
that
case
to
decide
whether
it
was
the
fifth
or
fourteenth
amendment
which
applied
to
puerto
rico.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
yes,
for
the
purposes
of
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
as
each
of
these
appellate
statutes
is
treated
separately
and
differently
by
this
court.
so
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
if
i
may,
in
applying
shell
company
to
puerto
rico
at
the
present
time,
we
find
the
puerto
rico
is
autonomous
as
to
local
matters.
there
is
no
direct
control
as
a
practical
matter
right
now
by
congress.
there
is
no
day-to-day
supervision
the
way
there
is
here
in
the
district.
therefore,
puerto
rico
is
the
type
of
place
where
congress
wanted
section
1983
to
apply
when
it
amended
it.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
i
do
not
know
how
far
home
rule
goes
or
whether
there
are
any
actual
actions,
i
am
not
familiar
with
home
rule
at
all.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
yes,
but
still
there
is
a
question
that
this
is
the
seat
of
the
national
government.
it
is
a
place
created
by
the
constitution
itself.
i
do
not
think
that
puerto
rico
can
be
equated
with
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
constitutional
scheme.
they
both
may
be
unique,
but
it
is
a
different
type
of
uniqueness.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
the
committee
reports
to
public
law
600
specifically
so
stated.
they
stated
that
this
public
law
600
was
a
further
act
in
the
administration
of
territories
under
article
4
of
the
constitution.
so
the
question
is
whether
after
1952,
puerto
rico
became
any
different
as
regard
to
section
1983.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
i
was
going
to
say
it
was
more
like
a
state
than
it
is
like
the
old-time
territories.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
there
is
a
resident
commission
--
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
no
sir.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
because
the
constitution
so
provides.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
that
is
all
very
fine
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
yes,
as
long
as
the
commonwealth
government
does
not
start
impinging
on
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
is
as
far
as
they
can
go
and
that
is
how
far
as
any
state
can
go,
as
far
as
any
territory
go,
that
is
as
far
as
the
district
of
columbia
can
go.
i
do
not
think
puerto
rico
has
the
right
to
go
any
further
than
the
district
of
columbia
than
the
federal
government
or
than
any
other
state
or
territory?
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
your
honor,
the
language
problem
is
the
same
for
everybody
before
the
court,
both
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
second,
i
do
not
think
the
proper
solution
to
the
language
problem
would
be
to
say
that
there
are
no
more
civil
rights
in
puerto
rico.
the
solution
is
to
say,
well,
let
the
district
court
in
puerto
rico
conduct
its
proceedings
in
spanish.
now
it
is
my
contention,
the
contention
of
plaintiffs
in
this
case
that
after
1952,
if
anything
puerto
rico
became
more
like
a
state
than
anything
else.
i
should
point
out
that
since
1952,
not
a
single
federal
statute
that
had
been
held
to
apply
to
puerto
rico
before
1952
has
ever
been
held
inapplicable
to
post
1952
puerto
rico.
in
other
words,
to
hold
now
that
section
1983
does
not
apply
would
be
the
first
time
that
this
court
or
any
court
as
far
as
i
know
has
held
that
a
federal
statute
applicable
to
pre
1952
puerto
rico
is
inapplicable
to
post
1952
puerto
rico.
going
back
again,
also
to
the
shell
company
case,
we
have
to
find
--
we
have
to
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
in
1952
when
it
granted
puerto
rico
the
power
to
draft
its
constitution.
i
think
it
is
quite
evident
that
congress
was
very
concerned
that
the
constitutional
rights,
united
states
constitutional
rights
be
preserved
in
puerto
rico.
after
1952,
the
joint
resolution
approving
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico
provided
that
the
constitution
would
not
go
--
enter
into
effect
unless
it
conformed
with
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
section
2
of
the
federal
relations
act
which
was
continued
in
effect
by
public
law
600,
equates
puerto
rico
with
the
state
of
the
union
in
so
far
as
the
rights,
privileges,
immunities
of
its
citizens
are
concerned.
it
is
interesting
that
this
is
the
same
language
used
in
section
1983.
when
congress
was
studying
the
proposed
constitution,
it
required
an
amendment
to
the
proposed
article
7
to
the
effect
that
the
applicable
--
that
no
subsequent
amendment
to
the
puerto
rico
constitution
would
be
passed
that
did
not
conform
to
the
applicable
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
conference
report
to
senate,
3336
which
later
became
public
law
600,
stated
that
this
matter
that
is
that
the
proposed
puerto
rico
constitution
and
public
law
600
would
be
a
“fundamental
contribution
to
the
art
and
practice
of
the
government
and
administration
of
territories
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states.”
in
other
words,
public
law
600
in
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico
are
merely
a
further
step
in
the
administration
of
territories
under
article
4
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
finally,
on
this
point,
it
is
also
clear
from
the
legislative
history
surrounding
public
law
600
that
the
changes
brought
about
by
the
law
where
only
matters
of
“purely
local
concern,”
this
is
a
quote
from
the
committee
report
to
public
law
600.
so
in
concluding
on
this
point,
the
argument
of
the
commonwealth
that
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
advocated
its
responsibility
under
article
4
that
it
just
withdrew
section
1983
protection
from
post
1952
puerto
rico
is
contrary
to
all
the
legislative
history
surrounding
public
law
600.
now,
if
this
court
finds
that
puerto
rico
is
a
state
or
territory
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983,
then
the
substantive
matter
presented
to
the
court
or
in
this
case,
like
some
of
it
has
already
been
decided
by
the
case
of
in
re
griffiths,
nevertheless,
the
court,
i
mean,
commonwealth
is
arguing
that
it
is
entitled
to
a
broader
or
more
liberal
test
regarding
its
justification
for
the
discrimination
against
aliens.
i
should
point
out
that
the
discrimination
here
is
not
against
just
these
plaintiffs.
it
is
not
a
personal
discrimination.
it
is
an
across
the
board
discrimination.
the
justification
presented
by
or
the
reasons
why
the
commonwealth
thinks
it
should
be
entitled
to
a
broader
test
or
more
liberal
tests
is
first
of
all
because
of
its
special
position
or
rather
because
it
is
different
from
the
state
or
the
union
and
second
because
of
the
specific
factual
situation
existing
in
present
day
puerto
rico.
on
the
first
point,
the
position
of
the
commonwealth,
it
is
my
contention
that
constitutional
uniqueness
or
uniqueness
under
the
constitutional
scheme
or
in
the
constitutional
scheme
is
not
the
same
as
exemption
from
the
requirements
of
that
constitutional
scheme.
the
test
of
a
justification
should
not
be
the
position
of
the
governmental
authority
imposing
the
discrimination,
but
rather
the
effect
of
that
discrimination
on
the
person
being
discriminated
against.
the
aliens
in
this
case
do
not
care
whether,
i
do
not
know,
the
federal
government
or
a
territorial
government
or
the
government
of
something
called
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
that
is
denying
them
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
they
are
still
being
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
the
effect
is
that
they
are
being
denied
their
right
to
work,
to
exercise
a
profession
solely
because
they
are
aliens.
in
their
brief,
the
commonwealth
cites
or
refers
to
general
unemployment
figures
in
puerto
rico,
but
it
does
not
cite
what
it
should
cite
which
is
the
unemployment
figures
for
engineers
in
puerto
rico.
they
do
not
cite
general
per
capita
income,
i
mean,
they
do
cite
general
per
capita
figures,
they
do
not
cite
per
capita
income
figures
for
engineers.
the
reference
to
illegal
immigration
i
believe
is
completely
irrelevant.
no
showing
was
made
that
immigration
tends
to
be
among
professionals
or
engineers
or
any
a
thing
of
the
sort
and
i
am
sure
this
court
will
agree
that
no
such
showing
could
probably
be
madeparenthetically,
the
commonwealth
in
its
brief
seems
to
say
on
page
20
that
the
states
have
the
right
to
regulate
what
they
call
the
influx
of
aliens
through
their
boarders.
i
submit
that
this
is
incorrect,
going
back
at
least
as
far
as
hines
versus
davidowitz
in
1941.
on
a
matter
of
employment
or
engineers
in
puerto
rico
just
10
days
ago,
the
president
of
the
university
of
puerto
rico,
dr.
arturo
morales
carrion
was
quoted
in
an
interview
in
a
local
newspaper
to
the
effect
that
in
his
opinion
the
orientation
of
education
at
the
university
of
puerto
rico
should
change
from
what
it
has
been
in
the
future
and
is
now
from
liberal
arts
towards
sciences
and
engineering
because
puerto
rico
needs
people
trained
in
sciences
and
engineering.
there
is
a
lack
of
this
type
of
training
in
puerto
rico
and
the
whole
university
orientation
should
shift
toward
this
type
of
training.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
that
is
correct.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
that
needs
to
be
interpreted
--
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
that
is
right.
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
statute
section
689
applies
to
aliens.
it
says
if
you
are
an
alien,
you
cannot
get
a
license.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
either
you
are
an
alien
or
you
are
not
and
either
it
does
or
does
not
apply
to
aliens
and
it
says
it
does.
there
is
nothing
left
there
for
supreme
court
--
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
where
you
had
a
vague
statute.
nobody
knows
what
is
just
cause,
nobody
knew
then,
nobody
still
knows
what
just
cause
means?
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
the
co-compelling
state
interest
put
forth
by
the
commonwealth
here
boils
down
to
denial
of
employment
to
aliens
for
the
sole
reason
that
they
are
aliens.
this
is
abundantly
evident
in
the
committee
report
to
the
amendment
to
the
engineering
statute.
the
committee
reports
said
that
other
countries
have
requirements
similar
to
the
requirement
being
considered
in
this
amendment,
that
is
they
require
that
people
coming
to
work
in
these
other
countries
be
citizens
of
the
country
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
wants
to
conform
the
law
of
puerto
rico
to
the
law
of
these
other
countries.
that
is
the
only
reason
put
forth
in
the
committee
reports
on
the
amendment
for
the
amendment
itself.
the
matter
of
civil
code
responsibilities
were
used
by
the
commonwealth
in
their
brief
is
also
false
issue.
if
we
look
at
the
statute
we
find
that
aliens
who
receive
their
education
in
puerto
rico
are
entitled
to
unconditional
licenses.
yet
the
commonwealth
forgets
these
aliens
are
just
as
free
to
live
puerto
rico
as
our
aliens
who
have
studied
elsewhere.
the
same
is
true
as
to
united
states
citizens
who
have
received
their
educations
in
states
or
the
union.
they
also
are
entitled
to
unconditional
licenses.
the
statute
contemplates
reciprocity
agreements
between
puerto
rico
and
the
states
of
the
union.
these
united
states
citizens
from
other
states
are
just
as
free
to
live
puerto
rico
in
case
of
trouble
as
our
aliens
who
have
studied
elsewhere.
i
cite
the
case
of
empresas
capote
versus
superior
court
in
my
brief.
in
this
case,
there
involved
a
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
contractor
in
the
civil
code
chapters
concerning
civil
responsibility
for
construction
defects.
the
supreme
court
stated
--
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
stated
that
the
term
contractor
is
not
limited
to
professional
engineers
or
architects.
it
means
anybody
who
has
promised
to
produce
a
certain
result
or
to
render
a
certain
service
and
the
fact
is
that
in
puerto
rico
there
are
very
many
people
who
practice
the
professional
as
i
might
call
as
that
of
contractor,
that
is
they
put
up
buildings,
they
put
up
whole
buildings
and
they
are
not
engineers.
if
we
are
going
to
require
some
contractors
to
be
citizens
and
others
not,
i
understand
there
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
the
law,
excuse
me,
of
equal
protection.
in
summary,
if
i
may,
in
borrowing
the
abstention
question,
this
court
i
think
has
three
courses
open
to
it
in
this
case.
it
can
affirm
the
judgment
in
the
district
court,
state
that
section
1983
applies
and
that
is
the
fourteenth
amendment.
secondly,
it
can
state
that
only
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
puerto
rico.
however,
this
i
think
would
have
the
effect
of
equating
puerto
rico
with
an
old
time
territory,
subject
to
direct
control
by
congress
under
article
4
and
limited
then
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
do
not
think
that
even
the
commonwealth
would
have
agree
to
go
this
far
or
it
can
determine
that
neither
the
fifth
nor
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies.
this
i
think
would
result
in
i
think
intolerable
constitution
vacuum
in
puerto
rico
because
it
would
be
the
same
as
saying
that
puerto
rico
is
independent
country
which
is
not.
it
would
be
the
same
as
saying
that
u.s.
citizens
residing
in
puerto
rico
are
in
the
same
position
as
your
citizens
residing
in
say
france.
finally,
the
commonwealth
request
that
if
the
court
finds
that
section
1983
does
not
apply,
oh!
no
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
no
there
is
not.
all
this
was
raised
before
this
court.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
there
are
several
cases
in
the
district
court
that
are
already
decided
the
same
point
against
the
commonwealth.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
i
have
only
seen
the
one
with
white
cover.
mr.
max
ramirez
de
arellano
i
have
never
seen
the
gray
one
before,
i
do
not
know.
