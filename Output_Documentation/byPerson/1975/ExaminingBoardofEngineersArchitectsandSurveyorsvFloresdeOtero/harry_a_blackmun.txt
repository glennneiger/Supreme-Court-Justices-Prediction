justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
a
three-judge
district
court,
federal
district
court
in
puerto
rico.
a
statute
of
the
commonwealth
permits
only
united
states
citizens
to
receive
licenses
and
to
practice
privately
as
civil
engineers
there.
a
non-citizen
may
not
be
licensed
with
the
exception
that
he
may
enjoy
a
special
dispensation
on
a
temporary
basis
if
he
works
for
a
municipal
corporation
on
the
island.
the
plaintiffs
who
are
appellees
here
are
civil
engineers
who
are
aliens
but
who
are
legally
residing
in
puerto
rico
and
each
one
sued
the
examining
board
and
its
members,
and
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
basic
question
as
it
comes
to
us
is
one
of
jurisdiction
under
two
statutes
known
as
28
usc
13-433
and
42
usc
1983,
these
are
statutes
that
are
subject
to
much
litigation
these
days.
the
later
one
provides
that
every
person
who
under
color
of
any
statute
of
any
state
or
territory
deprives
another
of
a
constitutional
right,
shall
be
liable
and
so
forth,
and
the
issue
as
it's
presented
to
us
really
is
whether
puerto
rico
is
a
state
or
territory?
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
and
then
it
decided
that
the
citizenship
requirement
was
unconstitutional
and
it
ordered
the
applicants
to
be
licensed
as
civil
engineers
and
the
case
came
on
appeal
directly
here.
the
lengthy
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
district
court
indeed
did
have
jurisdiction
and
this
took
us
into
a
review
of
the
legal
history
of
the
commonwealth
and
a
study
of
the
extent
to
which
the
constitution
in
our
federal
statutes
apply
to
puerto
rico.
we
conclude
that
the
federal
district
court
on
the
island
before
puerto
rico
became
a
commonwealth
in
1952,
had
the
same
jurisdiction
to
enforce
rights
of
this
kind
as
did
federal
courts
in
the
several
states.
we
further
hold
that
congress
by
entering
into
the
compact
by
which
puerto
rico
assumed
commonwealth
status
did
not
intend
to
leave
the
protection
of
federal
rights
exclusively
to
local
puerto
rico
courts.
this
is
so
despite
the
the
fact
that
puerto
rico
occupies
a
unique
relationship
to
the
united
states,
and
it
makes
little
matter
for
our
disposition
whether
the
island
is
considered
a
territory
or
a
state
for
purposes
of
the
jurisdictional
issue.
and
then
we
further
hold
that
the
court
correctly
determined
that
abstention
was
unnecessary
here
in
regard
to
this
particular
statute.
finally,
we
hold
that
puerto
rico's
prohibition
of
an
aliens
engaging
in
the
private
practice
of
engineering
deprives
the
applicant's
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
in
laws
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983
and
that
this
is
so
whether
it
is
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
has
application.
the
justifications
advanced
by
puerto
rico
for
drawing
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens,
we
conclude
were
not
sufficient.
accordingly,
the
two
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
on
a
review
here
are
affirmed.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
disposition
of
this
case.
