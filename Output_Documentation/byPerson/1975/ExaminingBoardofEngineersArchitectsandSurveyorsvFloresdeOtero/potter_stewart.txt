stewart
but
you
do?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
concede
that
either
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
fifth
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
people
of
puerto
rico
and
that
the
net
result
is
the
same
whichever?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
also
embraces
the
concept
of
equal
protection?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
real
discussion
of
these
questions
in
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
reason
is
that
these
are
all
that
thrush
out
in
the
district
court
and
then
the
first
circuit
and
that
the
law
had
been
established
in
your
favor,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
i
forgot
that
you
are
responsible
for
this,
but
maybe
you
can
at
least
clarify.
i
have
before
me
two
copies
of
what
this
label
of
brief
for
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae,
both
seem
to
have
been
filed
on
november
29,
1975,
one
has
a
gray
color
and
one
has
a
white
color,
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so
which
is
the
corrected
copy
then?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
very
much.
