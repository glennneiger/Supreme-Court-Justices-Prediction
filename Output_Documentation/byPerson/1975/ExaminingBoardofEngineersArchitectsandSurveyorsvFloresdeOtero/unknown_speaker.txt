unknown

if
you
fail
on
the
first?
unknown
speaker
i
supposed
that
you
are
confined
to
puerto
rico
and
yet
i
supposed
we
have
to
think,
if
we
were
to
decide
in
your
favor,
the
possible
application
of
it
to
guam,
the
virgin
islands
and
others,
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
our
decision
in
the
bivens
case?
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
our
decision
in
the
bivens
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
wondered
that
was
the
case
in
which
we
dealt
with
the
possibility
in
the
district
of
columbia,
notwithstanding
1983
does
not
apply
to
the
district
columbia
course
because
it
is
not
a
state
or
territory
within
1983,
there
might
nevertheless
perhaps
be
an
action
for
alleged
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
in
the
federal
courts
of
the
district
without
reference
to
1983?
unknown
speaker
did
you
consider
that?
unknown
speaker
the
compact
of
1952,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
prior
to
1952
and
subsequent
to
1917
the
citizenship
was
granted,
do
you
think
1983
was
applicable
then?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
are
also
relying
in
part
on
the
compact?
unknown
speaker
and
i
am
just
trying
to
go
back
to
the
pre-compact
days
and
wonder
whether
the
situation
would
be
any
different
without
the
compact
to
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
but
we
already,
i
mean,
1983
is
inapplicable
at
puerto
rico?
there
is
not
any
other
source
of
jurisdiction
substantively
--
of
the
substantive
right
in
the
district
courts?
unknown
speaker
what
about
our
bivens
decision?
unknown
speaker
does
calero
help
you
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
your
submission
is
that
puerto
rico
remains
a
territory
within
the
meaning
of
1983,
even
the
commonwealth
act
i
gather,
constitutionally
has
its
source
in
the
authority
of
congress
to
regulate
the
territory?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
what
purpose
would
be
served
--
i
gather
this
statute
is
not
checked
in
before
your
supreme
court,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
would
it
serve
any
purpose
in
light
of
the
issue
that
has
involved
in
the
constitutional
issue
to
send
it
to
that
court?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
what
the
interpretation,
i
gather
to
satisfy
you
would
have
to
be
that
aliens
are
not
subject
to
the
--?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
way
can
we
construed
not
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
there
is
not
like
the
fornaris
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
not
a
jurisdiction
not
here?
unknown
speaker
then
was
it
not
a
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
under
1331.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
say
so
in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
it
was
clear?
