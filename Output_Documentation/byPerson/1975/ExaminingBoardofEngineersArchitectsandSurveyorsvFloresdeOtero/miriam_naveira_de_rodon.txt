ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
up
before
this
court
on
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
puerto
rico
which
in
a
divided
opinion
declared
unconstitutional
the
citizenship
requirement
of
section
689
of
title
xx
of
the
laws
of
puerto
rico
annotated.
the
pertinent
part
is
printed
in
italics
on
page
10a
in
following
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
appellees
are
resident
aliens
who
applied
to
the
examining
board
of
engineers
in
puerto
rico
for
registrations
as
licensed
engineer
even
though
--
and
even
though
they
were
non-citizens
they
did
not
attempt
to
establish
their
eligibility
under
section
689
by
demonstrating
that
they
had
studied
the
total
courses
in
puerto
rico.
the
examining
board
denied
them
the
application
and
appellees,
instead
of
availing
themselves
of
the
review
established
by
law
in
section
701,
immediately
repaired
to
the
federal
courts
and
applied
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
rights
1983
and
its
jurisdictional
counterpart
1343.
it
should
be
noted
that
section
689
has
never
been
construed
by
the
local
courts.
under
the
courts
of
puerto
rico
are
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
empowered
to
grant
all
remedies
which
can
be
granted
by
the
federal
courts
and
or
course
that
review
can
finally
be
granted
to
this
court.
appellees
are
at
present,
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
ascertain,
working
for
the
government
of
puerto
rico
or
its
municipalities
under
a
special
license
as
provided
by
section
689
of
that
very
same
law.
this
case
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico
and
it
has
great
significance
because
it
raises
two
very
important
issues
to
us.
whether
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
its
jurisdictional
counterpart,
section
1343
are
applicable
to
puerto
rico
and
second,
whether
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
from
passing
upon
the
interpretation
and
validity
of
a
statute
which
had
never
been
construed
by
the
commonwealth
courts.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
well,
neither
this
court
nor
the
circuit
court
nor
the
district
court
has
ever
found
it
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
or
the
fifth
amendment
is
applicable
since
it
found
that
the
fundamental
rights
of
the
constitution
are
applicable
to
the
people
of
puerto
rico
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
best
way
not
to
specify.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes
sir.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes
sir.
it
should
be
noted
that
at
present,
the
misuse
of
section
1983
and
its
jurisdictional
counterpart,
1343
in
the
federal
district
court
of
puerto
rico
has
literally
flooded
the
court
with
all
conceivable
types
of
cases
in
which
every
facet
of
government
action
and
decision
making,
whether
major
or
minor
is
being
questioned
to
the
point
where
there
is
a
real
question
as
to
who
is
really
running
the
government.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
i
believe
so
sir
because
in
puerto
rico,
the
civil
rights
actions
that
are
being
filed
are
not
being
filed,
let
us
say
like
in
the
prisoner’s
cases
or
in
racial
discrimination
cases
or
in
certain
definite
type
of
cases.
in
puerto
rico,
they
cover
every
government
facet.
for
example,
i
will
give
you
an
example.
the
removal
of
employees,
the
approval
of
probationary
periods,
the
transfer
of
employees,
the
disciplinary
actions
instead
of
going
through
the
administrative
processes
available
in
law,
they
will
repair
to
the
federal
court.
the
federal
court
will
assume
jurisdiction
and
there
will
be
a
trial
of
complete
--
this
thing
will
be
seen
in
the
federal
court.
if
the
government
announces
of
a
policy
that
it
plans
to
drill
oil
in
the
outlying
skirts
or
that
it
plans
to
mine
copper,
immediately
we
get
an
action
in
federal
courts
and
the
court
does
assume
jurisdiction
and
the
whole
procedure
goes
on.
and
i
think
that
if
one
examines
the
types
of
action
that
are
being
filed,
one
finds
that
there
is
definitely
a
difference
between
the
50
states
and
puerto
rico.a
ppellees
invoked
the
district
court’s
jurisdiction,
solely
on
the
basis
of
section
1343
and
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
we
submit
that
neither
apply
nor
were
intended
to
apply
to
puerto
rico.
our
arguments
are
based
on
the
carter
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
and
declared
the
neither
section
1983
or
it
jurisdictional
counterpart,
1343
were
applicable
to
the
district
court
of
columbia.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
commonwealth
as
well
as
in
the
case
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
determine
whether
a
statute
is
applicable,
one
must
examine
not
only
the
words,
but
also
the
context,
the
purpose
and
the
circumstances
in
which
the
words
are
being
used.
sections
1983
and
1343
have
their
roots
in
the
ku
klux
clan
act
of
1871
when
it
was
first
enacted
to
cover
just
dates.
it
was
not
until
1874,
when
the
substantive
measure,
that
is
when
1983
was
amended
to
include
territories.
no
such
amendment
was
made
to
the
jurisdictional
part.
it
was
in
1875
that
the
district
courts
got
general
jurisdictional
over
federal
questions
and
it
was
until
1898
that
the
united
states
acquired
puerto
rico
after
the
spanish-american
war.
ever
since
the
very
beginning,
in
the
insular
cases,
puerto
rico
has
been
considered
an
unincorporated
territory
not
intended
for
statehood
and
this
court
in
carter
said
when
expressing
its
view
on
the
territories
covered
by
section
1983
that
they
were
applicable
to
territories
in
a
transitory
nature
in
the
process
of
becoming
a
state.
in
1952,
the
people
of
puerto
rico
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
enter
into
a
compact
and
thereby
created
a
new
sovereign
entity
with
the
the
federal
political
structure,
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
now,
as
stated
in
carter,
the
section
1983
was
designed
to
apply
to
states
and
to
territories
which
were
in
the
process
of
becoming
a
state.
puerto
rico
is
neither.
furthermore,
the
conditions
upon
which
section
1983
had
intended
to
correct
whenever
present
in
puerto
rico,
the
courts
of
the
island
have
always
been
able
and
willing
to
vindicate
the
civil
rights
of
individuals
and
have
the
power
and
the
procedural
mechanisms
to
grant
all
remedies
that
may
be
granted
by
federal
courts.
we
submit
that
in
the
absence
of
a
more
definite
guidance
from
congress,
section
1983
and
1343
should
not
be
held
applicable
to
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico.
on
the
abstention
question,
we
think
that
this
court
in
calero-toledo
case
rendered
an
abstention
doctrine
which
was
quite
wide
and
liberal
for
the
commonwealth.
citing
from
the
wock
(ph)
and
hawk
opinion
it
stated,
“do
you
regard
to
the
statutes
of
the
commonwealth
under
its
compact
to
the
united
states
dictate
that
it
should
have
the
primary
opportunity
through
its
courts
to
determine
the
intended
scope
of
its
own
legislation
and
to
pass
upon
the
validity
of
that
legislation
under
its
own
as
well
as
under
the
constitution.”
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes,
of
course
the
only
alternative.
in
this
case
where
the
statute
and
question
has
never
been
construed
by
the
courts
of
commonwealth
and
where
it
may
very
well
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question,
abstention
with
it
would
be
very
appropriate.
section
689
does
not
contain
an
absolute
prohibition
against
non-citizens
obtaining
licenses.
what
is
meant
by
total
courses
has
never
been
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
and
could
very
well
be
interpreted
to
mean
courses
directly
related
to
the
peculiarities
of
a
poor,
overpopulated
small
tropical
island,
subject
to
such
tropical
hazards
as
earthquakes,
hurricanes
and
flash
floods.
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
has
been
reluctant
to
attribute
to
the
legislature
an
intention
to
pass
a
statute
raising
constitutional
problems,
especially
when
the
legislative
intent
is
not
clear
as
in
this
case
where
there
is
practically
no
legislative
history
to
go
upon.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico
contains
besides
a
general
equal
protection
clause,
a
specific
prohibition
against
discrimination
on
account
of
race,
color,
sex,
birth,
social
origin
or
condition
or
political
or
religious
ideas.
if
a
statute
does
not
measure
up
to
these
constitutional
principles
and
standards,
the
courts
do
not
have
to
reach
the
federal
constitutional
question.
as
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
calero-toledo
case,
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
puerto
rico
has
been
the
object
of
numerous
debates
in
international
forums,
especially
in
the
united
nation
where
the
creation
of
a
commonwealth
in
1952,
prompted
the
united
states
to
seize
transmitting
information
concerning
puerto
rico
under
article
73(c)
of
the
charter
which
deals
with
non-self
governing
territories,
thus
recognizing
that
a
new
sovereign
entity
had
been
created
within
the
constitutional
structure.
whether
puerto
rico
has
true
internal
self
government
is
debated
still
in
the
international
community,
especially
by
the
third
world.
thus,
that
this
be
so,
in
fact,
as
well
as
in
theory
is
important
to
both
the
united
states
and
puerto
rico.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
the
abstention
in
this
case
and
the
case
of
puerto
rico
is
especially
appropriate
and
in
accord
with
the
compact
between
the
united
states
and
puerto
rico
and
with
the
difference
that
this
court
has
always
shown
to
the
courts
of
the
commonwealth.
as
this
court
rightly
pointed
out
in
the
fornaris
case,
the
relations
of
the
federal
courts
to
puerto
rico
have
often
raised
delicate
problems.
this
is
especially
true
today,
when
the
misused
of
section
1983
and
1343
has
produced
a
fantastic
increase
in
a
number
of
cases
filed
in
the
courts
of
puerto
rico
and
has
led
to
an
ever
increasing
intervention
of
the
federal
judiciary
into
practically
all
aspects
of
governmental
functioning
and
even
minor
decision
making.
but
even
more
disturbing
than
all
this
is
the
fact
that
federal
juries
had
been
handing
down
incredibly
high
amounts
of
damages
in
cases
of
this
kind.
for
example,
they
awarded
$250,000.00
in
damages
in
a
case
involving
the
removal
of
a
local
government
employee
where
a
violation
of
due
process
was
alleged
based
on
a
federal
court’s
interpretation
of
a
local
statute
which
had
never
been
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico.
this
case
--
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
they
--
it
divided.
in
compensatory,
they
granted
a
$100,000.00
in
actual
damages
and
i
think
$150,000.00
in
punitive
damages.
this
case
is
actually
on
appeal
before
the
first
circuit.
it
should
be
borne
in
line
that
the
language
requirement
of
federal
jury
service
in
puerto
rico
makes
the
federal
jury
a
very
selective
one
for
a
large
portion
of
the
island's
inhabitants
are
not
sufficiently
bilingual
as
to
enable
them
to
qualify
for
jury
service,
spanish
being
the
native
tongue.
under
section
1983
and
1343
as
i
have
already
told
this
honorable
court,
some
purely
local
matters
are
taken
before
the
court
and
the
court
does
assume
jurisdiction.
all
these
cases
which
i
am
talking
about
are
normally
taken
directly
to
the
federal
courts
bypassing
the
administrative
procedures
available
and
the
local
courts.
we
even
have
the
situation
where
those
cases
which
are
pending,
applications
for
dismissal
are
made
and
people
repaired
to
the
federal
court.
no
allegation
is
made
that
the
administrative
or
local
procedures
are
inadequate.
it
is
just
that
they
prefer
the
federal
court.
the
congestion
of
the
court
calendar
that
has
not
sued
has
made
it
necessary
sometimes
to
set
cases
for
saturdays
and
for
after
5
o’clock
during
the
week.
we
have
had
cases
which
have
lasted
until
after
midnight.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes,
the
federal
court
proceedings
are
all
conducted
in
english.
the
local
court
proceedings
are
all
conducted
in
spanish
save
if
the
right
of
the
individual
before
the
court
would
be
put
in
jeopardy
then
they
are
carried
on
in
english.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
well,
the
federal
bar
in
puerto
rico
is
also
very
selective.
you
find
that
there
are
few
lawyers
who
practice
in
the
federal
bars
in
contrast
with
the
amount
of
lawyers
that
practice
in
the
local
bar
and
not
always
by
choice,
but
because
of
great
difficulty
in
the
language.
we
have
had
a
bill
pending
before
congress
to
try
to
remedy
that,
but
still
the
proceedings
have
to
be
conducted
in
english
and
this
especially,
if
the
court
will
pardon
me
the
digression,
this
is
especially
sad
in
the
case
where
you
have
a
criminal
or
a
person,
an
accused
person
before
the
court
who
speaks
no
english
and
you
have
to
have
translators
where
everybody
in
that
court
speaks
spanish,
yet
you
have
to
go
through
the
role
of
translating
something
that
everybody
understood
in
the
original
language
anyway.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
well,
i
think
that
as
the
test
is
that
you
should
analyze
the
situation
in
each
case
in
particular
and
find
out
if
the
same
situations
that
are
in
puerto
rico
would
be
in
guam
or
the
virgin
islands
in
order
to
determine
whether
they
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
we
are
and
the
decision
should
be
the
same.
that
would
have
--
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
excuse
me?
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes,
after
the
1952
act,
puerto
rico
has
the
only
commonwealth
position
within
the
federal
structure,
yes,
that
is
true.
there
is
none
other
like
it.
actually
--
yes?
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
excuse
me?
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
i
have
to
refresh
my
memory,
i
do
not.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
no,
i
did
not
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
i
would
like
to
finish
by
stating.
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware,
at
present
we
have
a
106
cases
filed
and
pending
against
commonwealth
officials
in
the
federal
courts
and
about
80
to
85
of
these
are
predicated
in
section
1983
and
1343.
these
cases
cover
as
i
told
you
not
just
a
few
phases,
but
ever
phase
of
government
action
that
could
be
imaginable.
i
think
the
commonwealth
is
advocating
that
the
invasion
into
the
commonwealth
governmental
functions
by
the
federal
judiciary
is
not
only
having
an
undesirable,
paralyzing
effect
on
government
officials
due
to
the
extraordinarily
high
awards
that
are
gotten
in
federal
courts,
but
it
is
also
causing
a
traumatic
damage
into
the
relations
of
puerto
rico
and
the
united
states.
and
i
think
that
as
this
court
has
already
indicated
in
the
wock
(ph)
and
hawk
and
the
calero-toledo
case
and
we
agree
the
doctrine
of
abstention
for
puerto
rico
should
be
liberally
construed
and
applied
and
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
the
district
court
should
have
abstained.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes,
in
1952.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
well,
1983
like
i
said
before,
the
conditions
which
it
was
intended
to
correct
whenever
present
--
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
well,
as
to
the
jurisdictional
because
1343
was
never
amended
to
include
territories,
it
just
included
states
and
that
was
approved
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
do
not
think
it
never
intended
to
cover
territories.
in
1875,
it
was
that
the
federal
district
courts
--
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
in
the
relations
act,
the
foraker
act,
and
the
jones
act
and
the
federal
relations
act
that
have
applied
puerto
rico
and
then
have
a
clause
concerning
the
district
courts
of
puerto
rico,
they
mentioned
that
the
district
court
of
puerto
rico
has
the
same
jurisdiction
as
courts
in
the
united
states,
but
if
territories
were
not
included
as
part
of
1343,
then
that
would
not
have
made
it
applicable,
they
would
have
to
go
on
under
the
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
told
by
the
solicitor
general
that
it
had
typographical
errors
and
that
is
why
they
had
it
printed
again.
i
asked
the
question
on
the
two
and
that
is
the
answer
the
solicitor
general
gave.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
i
think
it
is
the
gray
one
because
i
got
the
one
with
the
typographical
error
the
white
one
and
i
was
told
that
they
were
going
to
print
it
again.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
i
wanted
to
just
to
clarify
a
few
points.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
absolutely
clear.
the
commonwealth
courts
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
interpreting
what
is
meant
by
how
sturdy
the
total
course,
whether
this
means
to
have
gone
through
the
three
years
of
university
in
puerto
rico,
whether
these
are
topping
of
courses
necessary
to
practice
engineering
puerto
rico,
this
has
never
been
interpreted.
my
colleague
interpreted
to
me
the
whole
three
years
in
puerto
rico,
i
do
not
know
how
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
would
interpret
that
case
in
particular
whether
it
is
speaking
about
going
through
the
entire
university
or
just
some
specific
courses
which
would
qualify
the
alien
to
practice
law
in
puerto
rico
to
unique
circumstances
of
puerto
rico
itself.
i
would
also
like
to
clarify
that
we
are
not
alleging
or
contending
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
apply
to
puerto
rico
and
that
the
federal
constitutional
rights
are
not
applicable
to
individuals
in
puerto
rico.
we
are
just
contending
that
section
1983
and
1343
are
not
applicable
which
is
a
statutory
construction.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
i
think
specifically
puerto
rico
is
mentioning
1331
specifically
as
applicable
and
i
think
is.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
excuse
me?
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
they
did
not
allege
1331
in
the
lower
court.
possibly
there
could
have
been.
no.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
no.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
no,
they
did
not
make
any
allegations
except
1343
in
their
jurisdictional
basis
--
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
nothing.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
in
the
constitutionality,
i
mean
the
declaratory
judgment
in
the
constitution,
statute
was
one
of
the
complaints
--
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
no
and
these
people
are
working
with
the
government
so
i
really
do
not
know
how
much
damages
if
any,
could
be
--
if
it
is
$10,000.00
i
cannot
determine.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes,
it
does.
ms.
miriam
naveira
de
rodon
yes,
it
does
say
so.
thank
you
very
much.
