well,
they
have
independent
courts
just
as

does.
they
do
not

senators

congressmen
as
puerto

does
not.

are
certain
similarities,

they
not?

unique
than
the

of
columbia
as
compared
with
other
states?

does
not
have
representation
in
the
congress?

is
there
not
much
more
reason
for
puerto

to
maintain
autonomy
of
traditions
and
customs
and
culture
--

than
the
district

for
example?
