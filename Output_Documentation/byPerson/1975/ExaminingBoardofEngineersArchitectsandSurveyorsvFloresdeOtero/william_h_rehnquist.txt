justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
also
a
question
of
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
puerto
rico?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
different
then
from
the
50
states
of
the
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
those
compensatory
damages
or
punitive
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
de
rodon
let
me
asked
you
if
i
may
about
the
language
in
which
the
federal
court
proceedings
are
conducted
and
then
the
language
in
which
the
commonwealth
court
proceedings
are
conducted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
that
put
certainly
at
a
disadvantage
many
lawyers,
i
suppose
who
represent
clients
who
speak
only
spanish
and
who
are
brought
into
the
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
argument
you
were
making
a
moment
ago
suggest
that
there
was
some
constitutional
problem
if
congress
chose
to
exclude
the
puerto
rico
from
the
ambit
of
1983
or
1343?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
would
it
be
your
position
then
that
1983
would
not
have
applied
to
puerto
rico
up
until
1952,
but
afterwards
it
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
congress
not
--
when
did
congress
lose
its
general
authority
to
legislature
of
puerto
rico?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
is
it
not
governed
by
district
of
columbia
versus
carter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
that
certainly
one
of
the
tests
in
carter
was
the
fact
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
give
a
special
cause
of
action
in
federal
courts
to
people
whose
grievances
could
be
corrected
by
congress
itself
and
i
would
take
it
that
would
be
true
in
case
of
puerto
rico,
if
congress
has
still
has
general
legislative
authority?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
since
congress
granted
the
district
home
rule
a
year
ago
or
two
years
ago,
the
result
should
now
be
different
in
carter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
held
otherwise
in
carter,
at
least
the
courts
under
which
the
state
--
district
respondent
would
have
been
brought
via
federal
court
would
have
been
one
that
presented
no
language
problem,
now
i
certainly
concede
that
you
do
not
use
that
as
a
test
for
deciding
whether
the
statute
applies,
but
if
you
are
thinking
of
the
matter
as
rather
closely
balanced,
it
does
strike
me
that
the
federal
court
down
there
may
be
fairly
inhospitable
to
people
who
do
not
speak
the
language
in
which
it
is
conducted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
alleged
$10,000.00
in
dispute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
there
was
in
1331
jurisdiction?
