unknown
speaker
how
long
he
is
been
on
the
bench?
unknown
speaker
the
senate
could
be
confirm
now
for
the
present
vacancy
of
non-lawyers
if
they
wanted
to
--.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
just
said
he
did
not
have
to
go
two
trials
and
he
could
plead
guilty
and
go
right
up
and
have
this
de
novo
trial.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
had
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goss,
(inaudible)
since
78.
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
have
replaced
what
by
the
court--
unknown
speaker
this
is
constitution
amendment
is
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
exception
to
the
statement
you
just
made?
unknown
speaker
that
it
should
be.
unknown
speaker
but
they
could
not
be,
you
would
have
the
same
objection
to
those.
on
layman,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
apparently
the
kentucky
courts
accepted
this
in
a
state
habeas
proceeding,
accepted
this
issue
without
requiring
exhaustion
of
the
appellate
processes?
unknown
speaker
you
would
argue
that
a
court
minor
who
has
been
on
the
bench
for
six
months
to
be
competent
to
decide
what
evidence
was
admissible?
unknown
speaker
why
donâ€™t
you
stick
to
the
fact
that
in
the
magistrate's
court
those
questions
do
not
come
up?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
our
chedward
(ph)
helps
your
case?
unknown
speaker
this
case
when
it
was
back
in
the
kentucky,
your
highest
court
in
kentucky
was
just
reaffirmed
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
your
court
said
that
in
any
errors
except
the
one
that
is
at
issue
here
had
been
waived
or
at
least
not
pressed
in.
unknown
speaker
would
the
federal
habeas
still
be
open
in
this
case?
either
way
it
goes.
well,
let
us
assume
that
you
prevail
on
the
issue
here,
would
federal
habeas
still
be
available,
for
example,
the
challenge,
the
lack
of
a
jury
trial
or
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
well
what
kind
of
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
what
you
are
saying
is,
unless
it
were
a
deliberate
bypass,
it
would
be
open
in
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
as
the
case
comes
to
us;
i
take
it
--
we,
ought
to
judge
as
--
had
not
been
any
errors
before
the
magistrate?
unknown
speaker
and
in
any
event,
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
is
whether
there
is
jail
term,
the
conviction
that
is
not
an
issue
is
the
term,
it
is
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
not
if
judge
gilmore
has
anything
to
say
about
it,
i
take
it-
unknown
speaker
he
was
unhappy
with
your
confession
of
error,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
the
kentucky
as
i
understand
it
in
the
cities
with
20,000
or
more,
you
do
require
judges
in
the
misdemeanor
courts,
who
have
been
qualified
or
who
have
been
licensed
as
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
the
judges
whether
they
be
lawyers
or
layman
in
all
cities
in
kentucky
apply
the
same
state
law,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
other
than
convenience
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
smaller
and
the
largest
cities?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
judges
in
right
circuit?
unknown
speaker
but
the
appointment
of
the
trial
commissioner
will
be
by
a
district
judge
in
the
first
instances?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
though
if
he
appoints
to
layman,
the
layman
has
to
be
approved
by
the
chief
justice
in
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
defendant
has
no
money?
was
to
plead
guilty
in
appeal
and
get
a
trial
de
novo,
has
he
got
a
problem
on
his
hands,
how
about
is
there
some
fee
involved?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
costing?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
whether
there
are
any
substantial
barriers
to
his
hearing
a
constitutional
trial,
even
assuming
that
the
layman
is
incompetent.
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
no
right,
he
has
no
right
to
it.
