mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
the
appellees
today
is
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
require
that
a
defendant
who
is
accused
of
a
criminal
misdemeanor
charge
for
which
the
possible
punishment
is
imprisonment
that
-that
individual
need
not
be
tried
by
lawyer
judge,
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
mandate
that
kind
of
requirement.
now
the
tenth
amendment
of
our
federal
constitution,
the
states
have
the
right
to
establish
their
own
judicial
system
and
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
adopted
a
judicial
system
that
handles
misdemeanor
cases,
minor
criminal
misdemeanor
cases
and
in
part
that
criminal
misdemeanor
system
utilizes
non
lawyer
judges.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
tenth
amendment,
in
the
tenth
amendment
there
is
any
constitutional
compulsion
that
a
state
adopt
what
might
be
considered
an
ideal
system
of
the
administration
of
justice.
that
the
fact
that
a
judicial
system
has
lawyer
judges
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
are
good
judges,
whether
that
is
a
good
system
or
that
a
judicial
system
that
has
non-lawyer
judges
means
that
that
is
a
bad
judicial
system.
and
the
states,
the
state
of
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
in
part
adopted
a
system,
using
non
lawyer
judges.
the
issue
in
the
case,
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
judicial
power
was
constitutionally
exercised
by
judge
c.
b
russell,
it
was
not.
but
the
issue
is
whether
that
judicial
power
was
constitutionally
vested
and
we
believe
that
it
was.
we
believe
that
judicial
power
maybe
constitutionally
placed
with
a
non
lawyer,
well,
in
keeping
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
of
law.
court
proceedings
are
held
for
the
various
solemn
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
truth.
that
seems
to
be
the
very
heart
of
a
fair
trial
is
the
ascertainment
of
the
truth.
we
readily
agree
that
the
constitution
and
due
process
does
require
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal.
this
court
has
considered
several
times
what
is
necessary
for
there
to
be
a
fair
tribunal.
the
court
has
said
that
the
tribunal
should
be
unbiased,
that
the
tribunal
should
be
neutral
and
detached
tome,
ward,
moore
v.
demcy.
each
of
these
cases,
there
was
something
to
taint
the
tribunal
in
terms
of
his
biasness
or
his
neutrality
in
considering
the
case.
but
we
believe
that
a
non-lawyer
can
be
unbiased.
he
can
be
neutral,
and
he
can
be
detached.
this
unbiased,
neutral
and
detached
non-lawyer
judge
can
give
a
defendant
a
genuinely
fair
trial.
it
is
a
two
part
thing,
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal
and
we
do
not
feel
that
the
non-lawyer
judge
is
prohibited
by
that
status
from
being
a
fair
tribunal
and
that
status
neither
prevents
him
from
affording
one
accused
of
a
criminal
misdemeanor
a
fair
trial.
a
non-lawyer
judge
seems
can
look
at
a
case,
can
look
at
a
case
in
terms
of
ascertaining
the
truth
against
the
standard
that
is
required
in
a
criminal
case.
the
burden
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
believe
that
the
non-lawyer
judge
can
make
independent
judgments
of
the
truth.
there
is
no
real
probability.
we
feel
that
prejudice
will
result
in
a
case
that
is
handled
by
a
non
lawyer
judge.
there
is
no
nothing
to
show
that
non
lawyer
judges
convict
more
frequently
or
reversed
more
on
appeal
or
that
they
allow
matters
into
evidence
or
otherwise
handle
a
minor
criminal
misdemeanor
case.
in
a
fashion,
that
is
any
less
fair
than
one
handled
by
lawyer
judge.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
i
do
not
believe
that-
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
you
are
absolutely
your
honor.
there
are
i
would
say
probably
cases
where
they
maybe
would
come
up
but
you
are
absolutely
correct
that
we
are
looking
at
the
minor
criminal
offense.
we
are
talking
about
traffic
violations,
we
are
talking
about
other
violations
that,
that
more
than
likely
would
not
come
up
but
i
would
not
begin
to
say
that
the
non
lawyer
judge
would
necessarily
know
all
of
the
evidentiary
rules
that
a
lawyer
does.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
prevents
a
non-lawyer
judge
from
giving
the
man
a
fair
trail.
the
real
purpose
it
seems
for
due
process
in
a
criminal
case
is
to
give
the
accused
an
opportunity
to
defend
and
we
feel
that
when
you
do
have
a
tripartite
entity,
when
you
do
have
an
attorney
for
the
prosecution
and
you
have
an
attorney
for
the
defendant
that
these
two
attorneys
will
be
able
to
afford
the
individual
accused
of
the
opportunity
to
defend.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
the
right
to
a
lawyer
judge
is
required
by
sixth
amendment
and
specifically,
the
right
to
counsel
there
under.
but
we
believe
strongly
that
this
is
not
a
right
to
counsel
case.
the
rights
enumerated
in
the
sixth
amendment
give
the
tools
so
that
one
can
prepare
an
adequate
defense
in
a
court
of
law.
it
is
a
fundamental
right
to
one
accused
of
a
criminal
charge
to
make
a
defense.
due
process
says
that
he
must
have
the
opportunity
to
make
that
defense.
the
sixth
amendment
gives
those
standards
that
all
criminal
prosecutions
must
abide
by
in
order
to
give
that
defendant
the
opportunity
to
defend.
sure
he
has
the
right
to
be
informed
of
the
accusation.
he
has
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
against
him.
he
has
the
right
to
compulsory
process
for
witnesses
that
would
be
in
his
favor
and
he
does
have
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel.
but
the
rights
of
the
sixth
amendment,
basic
to
our
adversary
system
of
criminal
justice
do
not
have
as
a
part
of
that
bundle
of
rights
to
afford
an
accused,
the
opportunity
to
defend
be
right,
not
part
of
that
bundle
of
rights,
there
is
not
existing
the
right
a
lawyer
judge.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
this
our
belief
that
when
you
do
have
attorneys
who
are
advocating
both
sides
that
they
will
help
marshal
the
evidence,
they
will
overlook
the
proceedings
of
the
other
opposing
counsel.
they
do
and
can
require
that
there
be
a
regularity
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
would
certainly
believe
that
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
again
we
go
to
that
the
purpose
of
those
individual
setting
to
consider
those
types
of
matters
are
to
consider
the
ascertainment
of
the
truth
and
that
they
did
not
have
to
be
a
lawyer
judge
to
be
able
to
make
an
ascertainment
of
the
truth,
when
the
matters
are
presented
before
them,
they
can
fairly
and
impartially
decide
those
matters
as
they
are
marshaled
before
the
non
lawyer
judge.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
correct
and
that
individual
could
surely
make
a
fair
and
impartial
consideration
of
that
case
and
could
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
charges
that
he
would
need
to
consider
feel
very
strongly
that
that
type
of
proceeding
is
not
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
our
federal
constitution.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
i
would
only
say
that
i
think
that
it
recognizes
the
fact
that
there
are
matters
that
a
non
lawyer
judge
or
non
lawyer
individual
can
make.
here
in
that
case
of
course,
we
are
talking
about
clerks
and
they
were
making
determinations
of
probable
cause
for
warrants
on
municipal
offenses.
so
we
are
not
really
on
square
with
that
case
but
in
terms
of
reasoning
ability
that
we
are
because
it
is
a
recognition
that
non-lawyers
can
make
decisions.
jurors,
everyday
are
asked
to
make
just
significant
decision
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is
a
very
tremendous
burden
placed
upon
these
non
lawyer
individuals.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
as
it
was
presented
to
our
kentucky
court
of
appeals,
the
second
time
and
i
take
it
you
mean
when
it
was
remanded
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
they
had
not
been
presented,
yes
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
do
not
believe
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
addressed
itself
to
considering
that
kind
of
an
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
to
addressing
matters
that
are
not
the
judicial
errs
that
possibly
were
in
the
case.
here,
we
maybe
have
a
deliberate
bypass
i
think
that
is
probably-
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
think
that,
that
is
true.
we
argue
in
federal
habeas
corpus
cases.
however
that
those
matters
that
are
known
at
the
time
that
more
actions
are
taken,
that
these
do
need
to
be
raised
and
that
federal
habeas
corpus
is
no
substitute
for
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
as
the
case
has
been
framed
for
this
court,
i
think
that,
that
is
correct
because
those
have
truly
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
it
is
the
fact
that
imprisonment
was
the
punishment,
part
of
the
punishment
needed
in
this
case.
in
our
kentucky
system
and
nationwide,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
question
but
the
man
is
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
an
error
free
trial.
judges
who
are
lawyers
make
errors.
this
circuit
judge
who
considered
this
case,
the
habeas
corpus,
he
made
an
error
in
terms
of
the
whether
or
not
a
habeas
was
a
bailable
situation
in
the
state
and
it
is
not
a
bailable
situation.
and
the
court
of
appeals
brought
that
out
in
the
first
consideration
of
this
case.
so
there
are
errors
that
are
made
and
these
errors
are
made
by
lawyer
judges
and
non
lawyer
judges,
but
with
our
system
in
kentucky,
with
the
two-tier
system
we
presently
have,
with
the
courts
of
convenience,
the
police
courts
being
one
of
them,
we
have
also
the
general
jurisdictions
circuit
courts
and
attorneys
are
required
to
be
judges,
or
judges
are
required
to
be
attorneys
in
the
circuit
courts.
this
court
of
course,
had
the
occasion
our
two-tier
system
in
kentucky
in
colten
versus
kentucky
and
there
were
--
it
was
recognize
that
these
inferior
courts,
as
we
refer
to
them
in
the
commonwealth
that
they
are
designed
to
afford
the
speedier
and
less
costly
adjudications
and
that
if
the
individual
accused
is
unhappy
with
the
decision
that
is
occurred
in
the
inferior
court,
that
he
has
the
unconditional
right
to
take
an
appeal
although
it
is
not
really
an
appeal,
it
is
a
de
novo
consideration
to
the
circuit
court
where
a
judge
is
going
to
be
presiding.
there
is
no
record,
the
judgment
in
the
lower
court
is
not
considered.
it
does
not
get
into
the
case
at
all
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
in
our
state
system
your
honor?
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
that
is
what
this
is?
well,
this
was
the
initial,
this
case
really
evolves
from
the
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
circuit
court
after
court
of
appeals
and
of
course,
yes,
we
have
been
through
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
really
do
not
believe
so.
i
have
not
considered
as
to
whether
they
would
have
further
redress
in
our
state
court
system,
we
most
surely
had
this
case
before
our
highest
state
court.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
i
think
you
are
absolutely
correct,
he
was
quite
unhappy
with
the
developments
that
came
with
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes
sir,
i
think
that
is
the
very
fair
statement.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
absolutely.
we
are
talking
about
the
first
and
second
class
cities
as
our
constitution
breaks
down
by
population
size.
so
we
are
talking
about
those
cities
that
have
greater
than
20,000
people
in
them.
state
law
does
require
the
police
court
judge
in
the
first
and
second
class
cities
to
be
lawyers,
is
the
third
through
six
classes
of
cities.
all
the
way
from
less
than
20
down
to
less
than
1000
people
that
we
did
not
require.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
this
is
true.
the
criminal
law
is
all
applied
the
same
by
all
of
them
and
all
fifth
class
cities,
the
law
is
applied
the
same
in
all
of
the
fifth
class
states
that
exist
in
the
state.
this
is
the
very,
this
is
stated
in
the
section
of
our
constitution,
classifying
cities
in
section
156,
where
it
talks
about
that
all
of
the
cities
in
a
particular
class
that
their
organization
and
their
government
that
same
laws
will
apply
to
them.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
i
believe
that
there
very
much
is.
we
have
first
of
all,
the
consideration
that
obviously
as
an
outgrowth
of
that
smallness,
there
is
not
going
to
be
nearly
the
number
of
cases.
we
have
part
time
police
court
judges
in
the
smaller
cities
whereas
in
the
larger
cities
they
would
be
a
full
time
position.
in
a
small
city,
being
in
rural
parts
of
the
state,
the
police
court
judges,
they
know
the
people
in
that
small,
and
the
prosecutions
usually
are
not
that
vigorous
and
there
are
differences
in
handling
of
the
cases
in
a
smaller
class
of
city.
you
also
have
just
the
very,
very
important
factors
still
existing
in
kentucky
that
we
have
counties
in
the
commonwealth
kentucky
where
there
are
few
attorneys.
maybe
only
one
or
two,
or
maybe
only
four
or
five
existing
in
some
24
of
our
120
counties,
so
we
do
have
a
problem
that
i
think
that
you
recognize
in
argersinger,
that
we
still
have
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
although
the
situation
in
argersinger
and
as
far
as
the
distribution
of
attorneys
in
the
commonwealth
is
quite
different,
we
believe
in
this
case.
in
argersinger,
the
requirement
of
having
an
attorney
for
a
criminal
misdemeanor
case,
the
fact
that
that
attorney
would
come
from
a
first
class
city
and
drive
down
the
road
25
miles
to
a
class
of
city
maybe
a
fifth
or
sixth
class
city.
that
was
really
very
unimportant
as
long
as
that
man
helped
the
accused,
present
his
defense
but
we
are
talking
about
here
the
fact
that
as
our
state
has
liked
and
we
think
the
citizens
of
the
commonwealth
want
to
have
matters
handled
by
one
of
their
own
by
residence.
and
we
have
residential
requirement
for
police
court
judges,
so
it
is
not
the
shuttling
of
an
attorney
from
maybe
where
there
are
two
many
attorneys
in
louisville
kentucky,
for
example,
and
to
a
small
community
such
as
i
live
in
with
4000
people
and
less
than
10,000
people
in
the
entire
country,
only
fifty
miles
from
louisville.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
the
new
district
court
with
the
judicial
amendment,
it
will
be
patterned
after
the
districts,
the
judicial
districts
as
we
now
have
with
circuit
court
which
is
our
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
we
have
the
120
counties
in
the
commonwealth,
are
divided
up
now
in
55
judicial
circuits,
judicial
districts.
but
the
district
plan
is
to
be
placed
on
top
of
that,
so
have-
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
well,
the
judicial
amendment
specifies
that
each
county
shall
be
entitled
to
a
district
court
and
this
is
the
problem
we
get
into
at
least
problem
in
terms
of
the
way
this
case
has
been
franked,
is
that
we
do
have
multi-county
judicial
districts
and
there
will
be
multi-county
district
court
districts.
and
the
new
amendment
to
our
kentucky
constitution
would
say
that
each
county
is
entitled
to
a
district
court
and
in
the
county
in
which
the
district
court
judge
does
not
reside,
he
shall
appoint
a
trial
commissioner,
that
amendment
goes
on
--
that
section
of
the
new
amendment
goes
on
further
to
say
that
if
that
the
trial
commissioner
shall
be
an
attorney,
if
one
is
available
and
qualified
so
again
we
are
back
to
the
same
situation
much
as
we
find
ourself
before,
that
if
every
county
is
going
to
be
required
to
have
a
district
court
and
there
maybe
as
only
one
or
two
attorneys
in
the
entire
country.
one
of
these
is
probably
going
to
be
the
county
attorney,
one
of
them
is
going
to
be
possibly
involved
in
the
commonwealth
attorney’s
office
or
some
other
matter
such
that
he
could
not
be,
obviously
he
could
not
be
a
judge.
we
get
to
the-
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
the
district
judge
has
the
power
of
appointing
the
trial.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
there
are
lots
of
--
i
cannot
really
say
that,
there
are
so
many
things
that
i
have
not
been
addressed
with
this.
the
general
assembly
of
course
is
going
to
have
to
meet
and
put
some
flesh
on
these
bones
that
are
in
our
amendment
and
of
course
the
supreme,
our
new
state
supreme
court
chief
justice,
he
is
given
quite
a
little
bit
of
authority
and
he
has
a
lot
of
decision
making
to
make
in
the
next
couple
of
-
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
do
not
believe
so,
if
he
wants
to
plead
guilty,
he
can
that
he
will
go
right
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
cannot,
i
do
not
know,
if
it
costed
that
they
would
take
into
take
his
case
from
the
police
court.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
do
not
know
the
cost
figure
but
we
do
have
and
i
believe
that
the
statute,
26010
that
sets
up
the
police
courts,
it
gives
the
police
courts
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
circuit
court.
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
that
has
a
lawyer
judge.
i
believe
that
the
individual
who
is
accused
in
police
court,
he
can
ask
that
that
case
be
initially
brought
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
believe
that
he
does,
the
court-
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
i
believe
the
statute
is
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
i
believe-
mr.
robert
l.
chenoweth
i
can
not
really
tell
you
how
difficult
it
is
mr.
justice
white.
there
has
been
raised
the
equal
protection
argument
in
this
case
but
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
an
equal
protection
argument
in
this
case
which
in
part
we
have
talked
about
already
in
this
argument
and
that
is
that
our
classification
is
a
classification
of
cities
and
the
police
courts
are
incidental
to
that
constitutional
classification
of
cities.
all
individuals
who
proceed
through
a
court
in
a
particular
class
of
city
is
going
to
be
treated
--
have
the
same
situation.
is
going
to
be
treated
the
same,
he
is
going
to
be
faced
with
that
non
lawyer
judge
if
that
is
the
situation.
so,
we
have
i
think
here
clearly
a
situation
that
has
been
recognized
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
the
people.
it
does
not
necessarily
go
to
a
geographical
area,
at
least
not
in
looking
at
situations
as
we
have
here
which
is
and
has
to
be
recognized
as
being
significantly
different
than
the
situation
dealing
with
the
right
to
vote
for
example
where
you
do
not
necessarily
look
at
geography
but
everyone’s
vote
should
count
the
same
nationwide.
we
believe
again
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
explicitly
require
and
that
there
is
no
implicit
guarantee
that
an
individual
who
is
accused
of
a
criminal
misdemeanor
case
for
which
imprisonment
is
a
possibility
that
the
constitution
requires
that
that
case
be
heard
by
a
lawyer
judge.
we
believe
the
non-lawyer
judge
can
and
the
truth
and
fact
finding
adversary
process
that
he
can
make
a
fair
decision
and
if
he
is
not
biased
and
he
is
not
neutral
and
detached
that
he
will
in
keeping
with
the
due
process
have
afforded
a
fair
trial
in
a
fair
tribunal.
