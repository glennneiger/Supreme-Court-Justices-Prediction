justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
goss,
before
you
proceed
does
kentucky
require
a
law
degree
to
be
license
to
practice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
fairly
reasonable
in
terms
of
an
absolute
requirement
is
it
not
the
law
degree
that
did
not
last
quite
to
10
to
20
years.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
goss,
if
your
plaintiff
had
charged
only
with
misdemeanor
that
called
for
no
prison
sentence.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
your
client
which
i
just
--
the
third
time
say
with
some
traffic
violation
and
that
kentucky
law
authorized
the
revocation
of
his
license
and
issued
whether
he
would
be
convicted,
and
if
so,
this
license
would
be
revoked.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
you
would
draw
the
line
with
argersinger?.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
again
if
you
are
traveling
salesman
and
lost
your
driverâ€™s
license
that
the
sanction
might
be
very
much
more
serious
for
you
than
if
you
confined
in
the
jail
for
a
night
or
two.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
kentucky,
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
driver
