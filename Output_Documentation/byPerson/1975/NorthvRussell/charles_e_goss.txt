mr.
charles
e.
goss
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
charles
e.
goss
and
i
am
counsel
for
the
appellant.
my
client
want
to
know
what
is
under
sentence
of
30
days
of
imprisonment
in
the
harlan
county
jail
which
was
imposed
upon
him
by
one
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
judge
cb
russell,
who
is
the
judge
of
the
lynch
city
police
court,
lynch
harlan
county,
kentucky.
this
appeal
is
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
and
challenges
on
fourteenth
and
sixth
amendment
grounds,
the
constitutionality
of
certain
kentucky
statutes
which
empower
non-lawyer
judges
to
preside
in
criminal
cases
and
to
impose
sentences
of
imprisonment.
since
this
appeal
tests
the
competency
and
the
capacity
of
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
judge
russell
i
will
begin
by
discussing,
judge
russell’s
credentials,
his
qualifications
to
act
as
a
judge.
i
would
start
by
saying
that
judge
russell
is
not
a
lawyer.
he
is
a
coal
miner
and
he
has
had
absolutely
no
legal
training
or
whatever.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
your
honor,
at
the
time
the
appellant
was
tried,
judge
russell
had
been
on
the
bench
for
six
months,
in
the
small
fifth
class
city,
which
does
not
auger
for
very
much
experience
because
the
fact
that
they
do
not
have
a
very
heavy
caseload.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
it
is
a
part
time
job
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
much
like
the
some
of
the
states
in
this
country,
i
was
in
england
recently
and
did
a
very
brief
study
of
the
lay
judge
system
over
there.
and
i
found
that
the
lay
judge
system
in
england
is
quite
different
from
the
system
in
our
country
and
that
there
they
said
entitled
of
three
and
they
have
at
their
disposal
the
services
of
the
clark.
what
they
call
clark
and
he
is
a
gentlemen
who
really
makes
the
legal
decisions
and
the
man
who
advises
the
court
as
to
what
the
applications
of
the
law
ought
to
be
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
he
is
a
barrister
or
a
solicitor.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
should
--
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
certainly
hope
that
there
is
no
question
about
it
in
view—
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
emphasize
on
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
i
felt
that
it
was
important
to
this
argument
to
bring
in
to
the
focus,
the
lack
of
competency
and
capacity
to
this
particular
judge
at
being
rather
the
crux
jof
this
case.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
indeed
i
would.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
the
resource
that
i
have
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
is
true
mr.
chief
justice,
my
research
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
well,
i
would
suppose
that
if
that
situation
were
ever
confronted
the
senate,
the
senate
would
be
most
reluctant
to
confirm
a
man
who
was
untrained
in
the
law.
i
might
say
this
that
in
my
research
does
not
indicate
that
there
has
ever
been
in
the
history
of
this
court,
a
person
who
is
a
judge,
who
is
not
trained
in
the
law,
who
is
not
a
lawyer.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
your
honor,
i
am
not.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
there
are
many
variations
of
court
systems
in
the
different
states.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
was
very
interested
in
the
english
courts
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
way
that
they
are
put
together.
the
three
judges
over
there
are
lay
judges
often
they
sit
stipendiary
magistrates
or
trained
barristers
or
solicitors.
they
are
largely
a
blue
ribbon
jury
because
the
decisions
that
they
make
are
largely
factual
decision
rather
than
the
decisions
of
law,
although
they
do
apply
the
law
to
a
case
much
in
the
way
that
the
jury
does
in
this
country.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall
and
they
do
not
live
under
the
same
kind
of
constitution
that
we
live
under.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
what
i
mean
--
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways,
i
would
say
that
not
only
that
he
did
not
have
a
law
degree
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
would
say
also
that
he
did
not
have
possessed
sufficient
legal
knowledge.
subjectively
to
have
accorded
in
oath
his
constitutional
rights
is
substantive
and
procedural
constitutional
rights.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
all
the
legal
issues
would
be
involved
in
this
case.
there
were
legal
issues
that
were
brought
to
the
forefront
in
the
actual
trial
itself.
mr.
chief
justice.
lonnie
north
when
he
went
in
to
the
courtroom
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
demanded
a
trial
by
jury.
the
judge
retired
to
an
office
in
the
next
room
for
a
few
minutes.
first,
he
said
i
will
give
you
a
jury
trial
if
it
takes
me
all
night.
he
came
back
after
having
been
in
there
for
a
while
and
said
i
just
talked
to
the
city
prosecutor
and
he
tells
me
that
i
do
not
have
to
give
you
a
trial
by
jury.
i
am
going
to
try
you
myself
that
mr.
chief
justice
was
a
decision
of
law
in
which
he
erred
grievously.
and
that
was
one
of
the
most
elementary
propositions
in
kentucky
that
under
the
kentucky
constitution
section
11,
this
man
was
indeed
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
mr.
justice
powell,
it
does.
you
have
to
have
a
law
degree
and
you
have
to
pass
the
bar
examination
and
you
have
to
be
licensed.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
it
was
not
in
my
memory.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
other
legal
judgments
that
were
required
to
be
made
mr.
chief
justice
were
decisions
that
pertained
to
this
man’s
constitutional
rights.
he
was
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel
at
this
hearing
but
he
did
not
have
counsel.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
indeed
and
i
think
there
are
still—
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
think
they
are
still
making
that.
some
of
them
are
still
lying.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
false
assumption
according
to
our
recent
report
done
by
the
boston
university
law
school
many
judges
are
failing
to
implement
the
mandate
in
argersinger
v.
hamlin.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
reversal
on
that
ground
except
that
in
kentucky,
we
do
not
have
the
review
kind
of
process,
we
have
it
trial
de
novo
process
in
kentucky.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
depends.
mr.
chief
justice
on
your
view
of
the
matter.
we
read
and
took
to
heart
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ward
v.
monroeville
in
which
it
was
stated
that
nor
in
any
of
that
may
the
states
trial
court
procedure
redeem
constitutional
acceptable,
simply
because
as
state
eventually
offers
a
man
a
constitutional
trial.
petitioners
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
can
distinguish
biased
between
lack
of
competence
in
this
respect.
bias
usually
appertains
in
the
case,
only
case
by
case
basis
and
competent
pertains
across
the
board
in
every
case,
in
which
that
person
sits.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
if
i
had
my
choice
mr.
justice
rehnquist
between
a
biased
judge
and
a
judge
who
was
unfamiliar
with
the
law,
i
think
that
i
would
be
a
hard
put
to
make
the
decision.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
could
present
a
problem,
will
you?
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
might
say
it
too
then
ward
v.
monroeville,
mr.
chief
justice
that
was
a
case
that
involved
a
fine
only.
if
we
were
talking
about
a
right
which
is
considerably
more
fundamental
than
the
right
to
protect
your
money
and
the
right
to
protect
your
liberty.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
building
partisanship
with
the
judge,
yes
it
was
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
the
natural
bias
was
really
the
basis
upon
which
that
case
was
decided
but
there
is
a
broad
language
in
there,
broad
constitutional
language
which
would
indicate
that
a
man
need
not
go
through
a
chamber
proceeding
of
the
kind
that
lonnie
north
had
the
go
through,
in
order
to
find
himself
eventually
in
a
constitutional
court
and
the
court
which
is
able
by
training
an
experienced
and
presided
order
by
judge
capable
of
courting
him
his
rights.
this
judge
did
not
advise
lonnie
north
of
his
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
he
did
not
advise
him
of
his
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
comply
with
any
of
the
mandates
of
the
kentucky
criminal
code
of
procedure
with
respect
to
advising
him
of
his
vast
constitutional
rights.
because
it
says
specifically
that
every
accused
will
be
advised
to
his
right
to
a
trial
by
jury,
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
to
not
to
incriminate
himself,
of
his
right
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
him.
none
of
these
things
were
done
and
then
when
it
came
down
to
the
trial
process,
the
judge
says,
“i
am
going
to
try
you
myself”.
and
as
it
turned
out
only
one
witness
testify
and
that
was
the
arresting
officer
and
it
was
obvious
on
the
face
of
this
record
that
this
trial
contained
none
of
the
virtues
of
a
due
process
trial.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
we
need
to
prevail
on
the
fairness
for
this
particular
trial
and
we
need
to
prevail
on
the
fairness
of
the
trial
to
come
mr.
justice
white.
if
this
case
were
reversed
by
this
court
i
feel
certain
that
under
the
laws
of
kentucky
it
would
be
sent
back
to
kentucky
for
retrial
and
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
the
specter
or
the
probability
of
an
unfair
trial
and
a
court
presided
over
by
a
non-lawyer
judge
is
so
great.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
say
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
this
that
in
17
years
of
practice,
i
have
not
found
that
judge.
i
practiced
before
many
magistrates,
many
justices
of
the
peace
and
in
fact
that
have
been
in
on
bench
for
longer
periods
than
the
one
period
you
suggested
and
i
never
saw
one
yet.
that
was
able
to
conduct
a
fair
trial,
a
constitutional
trial
in
accordance
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
accordance
with
the
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
think
there
maybe
cases.
i
think
there
maybe
cases
non-imprisonment
cases.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
a
proper
training
perhaps,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
mean
if
he
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
on
that
one
restricted
point,
it
might
very
well
be
that
in
terms
of
one
particular
point
or
in
terms
of
performing
one
particular
service.
that
a
person
could
be
trained
to
adequately
perform
that
service
even
though
he
were
not
a
lawyer,
to
me
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
would
say
mr.
justice
white
that
a
criminal
trial
is
a
very,
very
complex
matter.
this
court
had
said
that
many,
many
times.
it
said
it
powell
v.
alabama
more
recently—
mr.
charles
e.
goss
it
depends
on
the
participants
in
the
trial.
i
would
say
that
the
trial
is
being
conducted
against
the
background
of
what
could
be
a
very
complicated
proceeding.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
mr.
justice
marshall
i
think
that
is
right
under
the
standard
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
articulate
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
disqualified.
thanks
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
if
that
had
been
the
case
mr.
justice
powell
i
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
would
regard
that
as
principally
a
civil
matter.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
he
would
draw
the
line
exactly
where
argersinger
drew
the
line
because
we
realize
to
understand
that
this
country,
there
are
over
50
million
traffic
cases,
i
heard
every
year
and
that
there
are
so
many
misdemeanors
on
the
books
that
never
really
result
in
imprisonment.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
would
say
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
situation
like
that.
that
the
trial
de
novo
procedure
might
be
adequate.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
as
i
see
this
line
of
questioning,
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
say
this.
the
other
trial
participants
in
a
criminal
case
are
lawyers.
i
think
that
the
trial
court
was
described
by
the
chief
justice
as
a
tripartite
consisting
of
three
elements.
the
trial
judge,
defense
counsel
and
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution.
it
is
our
contention
that
when
one
factor
of
this
tripartite
breaks
down,
then
for
all
practical
purposes,
you
are
dealing
with
a
non-constitutional
court.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice
i
used
that
--
.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
he
could
have
the
de
novo
procedure.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
without
going
through
a
trial.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
under
that
hypothetical
situation,
yes.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
if
i
said
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
said
it
in
error
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
this
one
was
not.
i
might
say
this
that
on
this
whole
issue
of
trial
de
novo,
there
are
some
things
involved
that
really
transcend
the
question
of
fair
trial
as
there
are
the
economic
disadvantages
to
a
man
having
to
go
for
two
trials
instead
of
one,
having
to
pay
a
lawyer
twice.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
but
there
has
to
be
an
appeal
that
lies
in
the
circuit
court
from
the
lower
court,
which
involves
activities
in
the
lower
court.
including
the
acquisition
of
a
judgment,
statement
of
cost
and
bringing
it
under
the
circuit
court
and
getting
a
bond
and
lodging
the
matter
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
he
can
do
it
all
in
one
stroke,
that
is
correct.
but
our
contention
is
and
our
question
is
why
should
he?
we
have
--
mr.
charles
e.
goss
mr.
justice
blackmun,
no.
that
is
not
an
available
procedure
under
the
laws.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
you
would
have
to
file
a
plea
of
some
kind,
there
would
have
to
be
a
judgment
of
conviction
whether
entered
on
a
plea
of
guilty
or
following
a
trial
before
the
de
novo
process
could
be
invoked.
with
respect
to
this
whole
idea
of
why
a
lawyer
as
opposed
to
a
layman,
i
think
if
one
starts
with
a
premise
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
two
of
the
most
fundamental
rights
that
we
enjoy
as
citizens.
one
being
the
right
of
the
fair
and
impartial
hearing
in
the
first
instance.
another,
the
right
to
affect
of
assistance
to
counsel
which
i
have
said
--
both
of
which
are
said
to
be
by
this
court,
very
valuable
fundamental
rights,
then
a
termination
must
be
made
as
to
what
is
the
best
way
to
protect
those
rights.
what
kind
of
a
judge
should
you
have
on
the
bench.
should
you
have
a
judge
who
is
familiar
with
the
rules,
should
he
know
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides?
but
judge
russell
did
not.
should
he
know
what
the
kentucky
rules
of
criminal
procedures
say
or
be
at
least
normally
familiar
with
him?
judge
russell
was
not.
he
was
asked
one
question
there
in
the
course
of
this
hearing,
if
he
knew
why
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
kentucky
were
important
in
the
administration
of
law.
his
response
was
very
curious.
he
said,
i
could
say
misrepresentation
of
justice.
i
do
not
know
what
that
means
except
that
it
means
that
he
really
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
do
not
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
exactly
what
he
meant.
i
think
he
was
trying
to
tell
us
that
he
did
not
really
know.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
he
certainly
did,
saying
that
he
did
not
agree
with
most
of
them.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
if
you
ask
rhetorically
of
why
not
lawyers,
why
not
have
lawyers
in
these
courts
then
i
think
you
really
reached
the
crux
of
this
case
in
terms
of
what
i
am
trying
to
put
across.
as
i
said
the
other
lawyer,
the
people
in
the
case,
the
other
three
parts
of
tripartite,
and
the
two
parts
are
lawyers.
why
not
the
judge
and
should
not
the
judge
be
the
best
trained
participant
in
that
criminal
process?
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
say
anything
about
counsel
having
to
be
a
licensed
lawyer
but
it
has
always
been
presumed
that
the
counsel
must
be
a
licensed
lawyer.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
there
are
some
in
this
judgment.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
there
is
some
suggestion
in
there
and
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
made
that
suggestion
in
the
amicus
brief
that
he
filed
with
court.
i
do
not
know
how
you
are
going
to
get
around
the
state
requirements
of
the
state
bar
associations—
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
is
right.
they
have
in
kentucky
also
but
to
us,
it
is
question,
do
you
adopt
the
objective
standards
or
do
you
adopt
some
subjective
standard.
do
you
put
the
benchmark
here
somewhere
and
you
say
this
man
has
to
be
at
least
be
able
to
read
and
write
his
own
name,
which
you
do
not
have
to
be
able
to
do
in
kentucky.
be

of
the
six

by

mr.
charles

constitutional
amendment.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
e.
goss
there
is
this
exception
that
if
they
are
not
available
within
the
community,
the
lawyers
with
which
to
staff
the
district
court
then
lay
person
maybe
called
upon,
assuming
that
they
are
properly
qualified
but
they
have
to
be
approved.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
they
have
to
be
approved
by
the
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
i
would.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
i
would
have
the
same
objection
and
it
certainly
would
not
be
an
objection,
it
would
be
hard
over
current
terms
of
implementation,
there
are
circuit
writing
judges
in
vast
states
in
the
union
that
could
be
utilized
into
situation
of
that
kind.
on
the
other
hand
if
you
adopt
some
subjective
standard
of
judicial
competency
such
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief,
then
you
get
on
the
question
of
probing
a
person's
knowledge.
you
have
to
ask
yourself
what
does
he
have
to
know?
how
do
we
find
out,
how
much
he
knows
and
what
kind
of
a
test
do
we
promulgate
to
determine
what
his
knowledge,
which
thus
would
be
a
very,
very
difficult
thing
to
implement.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
it
took
it
though
the
courts
of
kentucky.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
we
did
not
get
an
area
with
that
argument.
that
is
the
reason
why—
mr.
charles
e.
goss
yes,
that
is
true.
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
we
had
read
the
decision
of
ward
v.
monroeville
and
had
taken
it
to
heart.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
and
then
our
belief
that
this
man
was
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
in
the
first
instance,
we
took
the
harder
ground
which
led
us
to
this
court
today.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
it
was
a
harder
ground,
mr.
chief
justice
and
was
selected
and
that
to
us
it
accorded
the
kind
of
relief
that
ought
to
have
been
accorded
in
this
case.
to
assure
lonnie
north,
upon
re-trial,
he
would
be
tried
in
the
court
presided
over
by
a
competent
and
lawfully
trained
judge.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
mr.
justice
white,
that
would
be
a
very
interesting
question
in
view
of
the
trial
de
novo
in
kentucky,
i
am
not
just
not
that
familiar
with
that
particular
kind
of
practice,
i
wish
i
could
answer
your
question.
mr.
charles
e.
goss
that
is
correct.
the
appellate
processes
insofar
as
they
provide
for
trial
de
novo.
thank
you.
