justice
potter
stewart
if
i
cannot
pass
--
if
he
had
gone
to
harvard
college,
then
first
day's
class
and
gone
two
years
and
seven
months
to
the
harvard
law
school.
but
first
day’s
class
then
had
to
relieve
for
reasons
of
illness
and
never
resumed
the
practice
of
law
and
therefore
never
had
been
into
the
bar,
he
would
be
unqualified.
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
express
a
view
of
(inaudilbe),
in
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
argersinger
itself,
if
i
am
accurate
in
my
recollection
that
the
opinion
suggested
that
counsel
need
not
be
a
licensed
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
purposes
of
argersinger
requirement
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
not
right
in
my
understanding
that
in
many
states
those
formally
very
rigid
requirements
have
been
loosened
up
some
ward
at
least
to
allow
law
students
to
participate
in
defensive
indigent.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
could
you
measure
it
by
a
very
objective
standards
just
what
errors
did
he
make.
i
gather
in
this
case,
the
judge
made
three
or
four
or
more
very
egregious
and
self
evident
errors
and
so
obviously
this
conviction
if
my
understanding
is
correct,
i
understand
it
is
conceded,
then
this
conviction
should
have
been
vacated,
was
a
nullity
of
the
new
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
just
i
read
at
you,
you
insisted
on
not
bringing
up
that
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
obviously
did
not
get
anywhere
with
something
that
you
refused
to
embrace.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
chief
justice
has
just
indicated
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
in
this
case,
a
man
named
lonnie
north
was
held
into
a
kentucky
criminal
court
and
there
he
was
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
by
judge
c.
b.
russell.
judge
russell
is
a
coal
miner
without
any
legal
training
or
education
whatever.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
believe
that
a
trial
before
such
a
judge
that
results
in
the
imprisonment
of
the
defendant
is
constitutionally
intolerable.
it
deprives
the
accused
of
his
right
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
and
deprives
him
as
well
of
due
process
of
law.
beginning
with
the
capital
case
of
powell
against
alabama,
extending
through
the
felony
case
of
gideon
against
wainwright
and
culminating
in
the
misdemeanor
case
of
argersinger
against
hamlin.
the
court's
decisions
have
firmly
established
that
a
person
who
has
not
been
accorded
the
constitutional
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
cannot
be
sentenced
to
even
one
day
of
imprisonment.
but
the
essential
presupposition
of
this
basic
constitutional
right
is
that
the
judge
conducting
the
trial
will
be
able
to
understand
what
the
defendant's
lawyer
is
talking
about.
for
if
the
judge
himself
is
ignorant
of
the
law,
then
a
lawyer
for
the
defendant
will
be
able
to
do
little
or
nothing
to
prevent
an
unjust
conviction.
in
a
trial
before
such
a
judge,
the
constitutional
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
thus
becomes
a
hollow
mockery.
in
this
case
judge
russell
denied
a
motion
for
trial
by
jury,
although
under
kentucky
law
north
was
clearly
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
upon
request.
and
after
finding
north
guilty,
judge
russell
proceeded
to
impose
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
although
such
a
sentence
was
clearly
unauthorized
by
kentucky
law.
but
even
if
it
were
not
possible
to
demonstrate
in
a
particular
case
that
the
lay
judge
had
been
incompetent
or
the
trial
egregiously
unfair,
i
think
that
any
trial
before
a
wholly
untrained
lay
judge
that
results
in
the
defendant's
imprisonment
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
seems
to
say
that
these
constitutional
deficiencies
can
all
be
swept
under
the
rug
and
forgotten
because
the
convicted
defendant
may
have
a
trial
de
novo
before
a
qualified
judge.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
cannot
agree.
in
the
case
of
ward
against
village
of
monroeville,
the
court
made
clear
that
“the
state's
trial
court
procedure
cannot
be
deemed
constitutionally
acceptable,
simply
because
the
state
eventually
offers
a
defendant
an
impartial
adjudication.
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
neutral
and
detached
judge
in
the
first
instance.”
the
court
today
would
distinguish
the
ward
case
as
directed
at
the
need
for
independent,
neutral,
and
detached
judgment,
not
at
legal
training.
but
surely
there
can
be
no
meaningful
constitutional
difference
between
a
trial
that
is
fundamentally
unfair
because
of
the
judge's
possible
bias,
and
a
trial
that
is
fundamentally
unfair
because
of
the
judge's
ignorance
of
the
law.
at
runnymede
in
1215
king
john
pledged
to
his
barons
that
he
would
not
make
any
justiciaries,
constables,
sheriffs,
or
bailiffs,
but
from
those
who
understand
the
law
of
the
realm.
today,
more
than
750
years
later,
the
court
leaves
that
promise
unkept.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
i
respectfully
dissent.
