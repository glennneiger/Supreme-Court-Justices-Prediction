justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
all
you
need
to
prevail
on
is
the
fairness
of
theis
for
this
particular
trial.
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
any
trial
whatsoever
tried
by
a
non-lawyer
would
fail
to
be
a
due
process
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
yes,
you
say
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
it
would
not
so
it
does
not
make
any
difference
how
otherwise
well
trained,
a
person
was
--
suppose
that
one
of
the
judges
had
been
on
the
bench
for
20
or
30
years,
had
studied
the
law
he
just
was
not
they
--
he
just
had
never
been
admitted
to
practice.
but
he
was
a
very--
as
far
as
anybody
knows,
he
probably
knows
more
about
his
business
and
the
lawyers
that
appear
before
him.
and
you
would
suggest
that
your
fear
as
there
should
prevail
and
upset
any
conviction
before
a
judge
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
apparently,
you
would
say
that
were
true
no
matter
what
the
issue
in
any
case
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
ever
let
one
take
a
plea
of
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
proper
training,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
if
he
is
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
would
you
say
that
would
be
also
be
true
in
any
none
where
the
plea
is
not
guilty?
if
the
only
issue
in
a
case
happened
to
be
a
particular
kind
of
an
issue
like
whether
he
was
hurt
or
not
and
the
fellow
happened
to
be
a
doctor?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
goss,
in
a
criminal
trial
always
a
very,
very
complex
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
going
through
a
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
still
make
the
same
argument
even
if
he
had
a
lawyer
to
advise
him
to
plead
guilty
and
take
his
de
novo
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
that
you
would
let
him
plead
guilty
before
a
untrained
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
did
not
say
that.
you
said
that
perhaps
somebody
could
be
trained
to
take
pleas
of
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
one
was
not,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you.
suppose,
the
gentlemen
went
to
jail
after
being
convicted
in
this,
by
this
untrained
judge,
and
he
then
went
through
the,
went
to
federal
habeas
but
he
have
exhausted
his
state
remedies
if
had
appealed
up
to
the-
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you,
you
and
your
colleague
then
differ.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
there
is
not
that
he
would
have
to
either
be
tried
and
found
guilty
or
plead
guilty
and
then
my
question
is
which
apparently
do
not
know
as
to
how
difficult
it
is
for
him
to
get
--
financially
to
have
a
trial
de
novo.
