is
he
a
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
is
a
barrister
or
solicitor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goss,
your
discussion
of
qualification
in
some
of
the
colloquy
from
the
bench
suggests
almost
assuming
that
the
point
in
argument
from
the
beginning,
when
you
said
the
man
was
not
qualified
and
he
was
not
competent,
all
you
mean
is
he
was
not
legally,
he
did
not
have
the
law
degree.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
you
not
distinguish
biased
from
lack
of
competence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
not
think
bias
is
a
more
serious
infection
in
the
process
than
it
is
lack
of
confidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
will
tell
you.
i
would
not
be.
we
had
justices
of
the
peace
in
phoenix
where
i
practice,
who
did
not
require
a
law
degree
and
some
were
lawyers
and
some
were
laymen
and
i
think
many
members
of
the
bar
would
have
chosen
the
laymen
to
put
their
case
before
just
because
you
could
get
a
pretty
competent
laymen
for
the
salary
but
all
you
could
get
was
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
so
far
as
the
lawyers
were
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
think
it
would
present
a
problem
if
your
view
prevailed
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
some
of
the
most
celebrated
cases
in
the
anglo-saxon
tradition.
i
have
involved
extraordinary
able
counsel
like
lord
byron
in
the
divorce
trial
of
queen
caroline
before
the
house
of
lords,
brought
before
the
impeachment
of
warren
hastings
before
the
house
of
lords
in
a
situation
where
most
of
the
house
of
lords
were
not
judges,
have
they
not?
