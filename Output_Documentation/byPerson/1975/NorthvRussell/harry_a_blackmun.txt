justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
mr.
goss
there
is
no
any
question
here
about
the
clientâ€™s
qualification
of
judge
russell
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
why
i
wonder
why
you
emphasize
on,
so
it
seems
to
me
they
are
fairly
clear
that
he
was
not
qualified.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
might
be
a
little
bit
about
the
kentucky
system,
you
do
have
a
second
tier
and
the
de
novo
trial
that
is
available,
could
mr.
north
have
pleaded
guilty
and
then
demanded
a
jury
trial
in
the
second
tier
without
the
plea
standing
against
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
in
the
de
novo
procedure,
he
could
have
obtained
everything
the
lack
of
which
is
the
basis
of
your
complain
now.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
we
pass
judge
russell
entirely
in
this
case?
i
do
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
your
court.
i
wanted
de
novo
trial
in
the
regular
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
to
file
a
plea
of
some
kind.
