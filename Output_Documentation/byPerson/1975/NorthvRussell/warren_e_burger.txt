chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
arguments
next
in
north
against
russell.
mr.
goss,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
part
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
is
like
the
magistrates
and
the
justices
in
piece
and
some
others
in
england
for
example
and
in
some
states
in
this
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
take
the
same
position
about
in
appeals
court
judge,
judge
that
was
reviewing
convictions
on
appeal
if
he
was
not
a
trained
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
might
have
that
problem
here
someday.
there
is
no
requirement
that
any
member
of
this
court
be
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
then
say
the
court
was
incompetent
there
as
a
whole
or
just
that
one
man
was
disqualified,
one
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
usually
involved
in
determining
the
guilder
innocence
in
this
case
trying
to
apply
the
law
to
the
fact.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
any
presumably
well
trained,
legally
trained
judges
have
made
that
judgment,
also
and
times
passed,
recent
times
passed
have
they
not?
until
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
this
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
the
judgments
so
obtained
would
be
subject
to
reversal
on
that
ground
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
better,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
might
doubt
that
case
was
dealing
with
bias
of
building
a
partisanship
of
the
judge
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
of
his
conflicting
interest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
not
say
anything
about
that
the
judge
being
a
licensed
lawyer,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
did
it
helped
you
very
much,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
many
people
say
that
on
appellant
courts
including
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
would
not
take
you
here
is
distinguished
from
disposing
of
the
case
with
much
less
difficulty
for
everyone
involved.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
chenoweth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
senate
tried
the
samuel
chase
175
years
ago
more
or
less,
and
suppose
not
all
of
the
15
senators
--
26
senators
were
from
the
thirteen
states
were
lawyers,
was
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
coincidence,
the
presiding
officer
was
a
lawyer
but
the
vice
president
of
the
united
states
might
not
be
a
lawyer.
at
present,
the
vice
president
is
not,
and
the
executive
officer
or
judicial
officers
were
tried
in
the
senate
today.
presiding
officer
ruling
on
evidence
would
be
a
non
lawyer.
would
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
kentucky
law
and
perhaps
you
may
seem
this
incorrect,
under
kentucky
law,
is
there
any,
this
petitioner
if
he
fails
here,
that
challenge
or
have
reexamined
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
lack
of
a
jury
trial
or
lack
of
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing,
there
is
no
statutory
equivalent
of
habeas
corpus,
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
equivalent
to
the
federal
2255
for
reduction
of
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
to
announce
in
74-1409,
north

for
reasons

morning
and
the
