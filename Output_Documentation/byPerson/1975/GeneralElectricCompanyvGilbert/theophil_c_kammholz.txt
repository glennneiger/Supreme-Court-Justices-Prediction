mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
do
not
wish
to
appear
here
with
an
undue
lack
of
modesty
but
i
should
like
to
note
that
in
our
view,
the
articulation
of
eeoc
guideline
history
is
set
forth
fully
and
hopefully
effectively
in
the
general
electric
brief
in
this
case.
in
appellant's
brief
at
pages
12
to
15,
and
42
to
48
and
perhaps
i
should
note
at
this
point
also
that
we
do
not
agree
with
counsel
for
a
liberty
in
his
assertion
that
in
the
initial
views
of
the
commission,
pregnancy
exclusion
were
considered
as
discriminatory
but
nonetheless
permitted.
indeed,
the
history
of
the
eeoc
guidelines
and
opinions
demonstrates
precisely
the
contrary.
thus
in
1966,
the
general
counsel
of
eeoc,
charles
duncan
who
testified
at
the
trial
in
the
district
court
issued
an
opinion
letter
and
he
said
this,
in
page
43
of
our
brief,
“an
insurance
or
other
benefit
plan
may
simply
exclude
maternity
as
a
covered
risk
and
such
an
exclusion
would
not
in
our
view
be
discriminatory.”
his
testimony
also
noted
that
in
1966,
the
eeoc
had
carefully
considered
all
of
the
aspects
of
exclusion
had
considered
what
little
legislative
history
there
was.
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
underlying
title
vii.
and
consciously
and
deliberately
viewing
that
history,
the
commission
was
at
the
view
that
the
maternity
benefits
were
in
effect
sui
generis
and
could
properly
be
excluded.
now,
the
relevance
of
this
history—
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
what
i
am
dealing
with
here
is
a
broad
context
of
disability,
yes.
including
maternity
disability
payments
which
are
at
issue
in
this
case
and
i—
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
for
the
purposes
of
this?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
i
should
note
that
there
is
not
involve
in
this
case
the
payment
of
hospital
surgical
coverage.
this
is
not
in
dispute.
we
are
dealing
only
with
income
maintenance
on
account
of
pregnancy
and
child
birth.
specifically,
the
general
electric
plan
provides
for
a
60%
income
maintenance
after
the
first
eight
days
for
a
maximum
of
$150.00
in
earnings
and
for
a
maximum
period
of
26
weeks,
pregnancy,
child
birth
disabilities
excluded.
the
record
also
shows
in
our
case
that
on
the
american
industrial
scene
at
the
time
of
trial,
approximately
40%
of
the
american
industrial
work
force
was
covered
by
one
form
or
another
of
insurance.
virtually
all
of
those
plans
limited
applicable
maternity
leave,
income
maintenance
to
six
weeks,
a
few
exceptions.
now,
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
problem
that
cuts
across
all
of
these
plans
and
if
the
court
should
find
that
there
may
be
no
differentiation,
then
each
and
every
one
of
these
plans
would
be
subject
to
attack
on
the
theory
that
there
is
as
different
treatment
for
maternity
benefits
and
illness
and
sickness
otherwise.
the
other
60%
of
the
american
work
force
is
not
covered
by
disability
plans
and
there
is
one
who
has
been
active
on
the
scene
over
the
many
years.
it
is
my
view
and
i
represent
to
the
court
that
there
would
be
a
serious
inhibiting
impact
on
other
employers
to
get
involved
in
the
first
place.
because
this
is
not
a
social
welfare
program
applicable
to
all.
we
are
talking
about
a
private
plan
paid
entirely
in
our
case
by
an
employer
and
the
question
is,
must
these
benefits
be
equated.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
put
into
focus
the
history
of
the
ge
plan.
it
was
adapted
in
1950.
it
is
now
financed
entirely
by
employer
contributions.
the
underlying
reason
for
the
pregnancy
disability
exclusion
is
shown
in
the
record.
ge
concluded
that
for
a
number
of
reasons
it
would
be
appropriate
not
to
cover
this
kind
of
income
maintenance.
thus,
under
ge’s
experience,
40%
of
females
who
leave
the
job
because
of
pregnancy
do
not
return.
this
contrast
with
a
return
well
up
in
the
90
percentile
range
for
sickness
and
accident,
absence
otherwise.
so,
to
pay
income
maintenance
would
in
effect
be
providing
a
form
of
severance
pay.
secondly,
the
ge
experience
indicated
that
the
median
absence
for
a
sickness
and
accident
generally
was
two
weeks,
for
maternity,
13
weeks.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
none
whatever,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
indeed
not.
the
record
is
undisputed
that
as
to
those
who
leave
on
a
temporary
disability
and
return,
everybody
comes
back
for
all
practical
purposes.
and
as
to
the
more
serious
kind,
the
return
rate
is
still
well
up
into
the
90%
range.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
in
rough
figures
perhaps
half
of
the
ge
employees
are
covered
by
collective
bargaining
agreements.
the
others
are
not,
the
salaried
not
basically.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
it
has
been
at
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
not
during
the
last
bargaining.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
not
during
the
negotiations
of
three
years
ago.
the
contracts
are
open
again
this
spring.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
fits
into
the
non-pre-textual
aspect.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
this
is
our
position
precisely.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
somewhat
less?
(voice
overlap)
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
would
be
much
concerned
about
that
your
honor,
as
bordering
on
the
pretext.
we
are
not
taking
here
the
view
that
business
considerations,
they
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
exception
is
applicable.
we
are
saying
simply
that
for
a
sound
and
solid
business
reasons,
this
exclusion
was
written
into
the
law.
and
if
i
may,
there
are
other
several
aspects
to
this.
next,
the
practice
of
the
insurance
industry
has
been
to
exclude
coverage
for
this
kind
of
risk.
the
theory
of
sickness
and
accident
coverage
is
to
protect
against
the
unexpected,
the
unforeseen.
pregnancy,
child
birth
can
be
planned
indeed
in
society
today
as
the
new
york
times
noted
last
week
where
we
were
practically
at
the
point
of
a
contraceptive
society
where
all
children
are
planned.
the
medical
record
shows
that
pregnancy
is
indeed
a
voluntary
condition,
that
contraceptive
methods
are
for
all
practical
purposes,
a
100%
effective,
that
abortion
is
legal,
that
in
the
early
stages
as
referenced
by
one
of
the
medical
experts,
it
is
an
in
and
out
noon
hour
treatment
at
menstrual
extraction.
the
techniques,
the
pill
for
example,
according
to
another
medical
expert
is
virtually
fail-safe
yet
according
to
the
record,
one
incidence
of
pregnancy
in
100
years
of
exposure
to
intercourse.
now,
beyond
these
considerations,
ge’s
actual
experience
in
terms
of
cost
in
1970
show
that
the
average
cost
for
female
absence
with
no
income
maintenance
included,
ran
$82.00
a
year
as
contrasted
with
$42.00
a
year
for
males.
the
next
year,
the
cost
range
was
from
$112.00
for
females
to
$62.00
for
males.
the
actuarial
testimony
at
trial
showed
that
the
average
of
insurance
plans
in
effect
in
this
country
at
the
time
of
trial
result
in
a
payment
of
170%
of
premium
cost
attributable
to
females.
that
with
a
six-week
pregnancy
income
maintenance
program
this
would
increase
by
roughly
1/3
to
230%
and
that
for
equated
coverage
no
matter
how
long
the
absence,
the
percentile
cost
would
rise
to
somewhere
between
300%
and
330%
of
the
cost
of
male
coverage.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
your
honor
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
noncontributory.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
is
self-insured
in
the
sense
that
there
is
an
initial
premium
paid
for
the
handling
by
the
insurance
company.
it
is
insurance
nonetheless
but
it
is
self-covering.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
which
is
precisely
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
percentage
of
a
170
currently.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
170%
of
the
male
cost.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
70%
more,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
mr.
charles
has
handed
me
a
note
here
--
well,
this
is
the
information
i
reference—no,
we
did
not
get
into
the
life
insurance
area.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
i
will.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
among
others
your
honor.[laughter]
i
should
like
to
note
in
passing
that
a
number
of
amici
have
covered
the
cost
aspect
in
some
depth.
the
experience
of
celanese
corporation,
for
example,
american
telephone
and
telephone
company
and
the
bell
systems
all
supporting
the
statistical
figures
that
i
have
noticed
here
in
reference
and
it
is
interesting
also
that
in
geduldig,
the
state
of
california’s
experience
indicated
that
an
inclusion
and
inclusion
of
income
maintenance
would
result
in
a
15%
rise
in
cost.
well,
may
i
leave
the
business
justification
for
ge’s
policy
and
touch
briefly
on
geduldig.
geduldig
arose
in
a
context
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
has
been
suggested,
indeed
argued
in
brief
by
opposing
counsel
that
for
some
reason
title
vii
should
be
dealt
differently,
dealt
with
differently
than
a
fourteenth
amendment
question.
there
is
nothing
in
the
decided
cases
to
suggest
this,
if
the
court
please.
that
congress
as
had
been
noted
in
the
prior
case
and
as
i
agree,
could
adopt
legislation
which
would
impose
the
kind
of
coverage
to
which
we
are
objecting
here.
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
congress
did
not.
the
legislative
history
is
very
brief
indeed
on
the
inclusion
of
sex
and
i
do
not
want
to
burden
the
court
with
it
but
you
may
recall
that
representative
howard
smith
of
virginia
was
the
original
author
of
the
sex
inclusion
and
everyone
of
the
members
of
the
congress
who
voted
for
that
inclusion
ultimately
voted
against
title
vii.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes
your
honor,
of
the
male
members.[laughter]
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well,
i
suppose,
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
terms
of
the
wage
approach
we
are
dealing
with
the
sex
stereotype.
we
are
dealing
with
all
women.
but
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
pregnancy-maternity,
we
are
dealing
only
with
some
women,
some
other
time
in
the
work
force.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
is
irrelevant
if
we
do
not
get
beyond
the
no-discrimination
because
of
gender
under
ilo.
we
stress
it
here
to
evidence
the,
well
to
negate
any
claim
of
pre-textual
motivation
and
to
establish
that
this
was
done
in
good
faith
and
on
the
basis
of
sound
business
considerations.
but
underlying
all
of
this,
our
position
is
that
the
congress
never
intended
this
kind
of
a
result
that
it
was
far
from
--
.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
your
honor.
but
not
this
cost--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
precisely,
because
pregnancy
is
unique.
it
is
sui
generis.
and
the
exclusion
here
does
not
exclude
men
or
women
from
a
risk
so
as
to
result
in
discrimination.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
the
several
of
the
amici
deal
with
this
as
far
as
our
record
is
concerned,
mr.
chief
justice
the
answer
is
no.
now,
with
regard
to
the
disparity
point
that
you
touched
on,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
equal
pay
act,
which
was
referenced
in
the
earlier
discussion
permits
payment
of
premiums
which
will
produce
different
results,
male
versus
female.
it
is
one
or
the
other.
an
employer
may
pay
the
same
premium
rate
and
even
though
this
results
in
different
benefits,
it
is
perfectly
legal
and
proper
under
epa.
the
office
of
federal
contract
compliance
and
the
department
of
labor
in
administering
the
provisions
of
executive
order
11246,
the
contract
with
government
executive
order,
since
it
is
in
section
has
permitted
precisely
this
kind
of
application,
same
amount
of
premium.
that
is
fine,
even
though
the
benefits
that
result
are
disparate.
in
1973
and
i
should
like
to
note
particularly
that
the
solicitor
referred
to
this
in
his
brief,
in
1973,
proposal
was
made
for
a
change
in
the
ofcc
guidelines.
but
that
has
been
on
the
back
burner
so
to
speak,
ever
since
that
time
and
there
have
been
statements
from
ofcc
whether
we
should
await
and
the
final
adjudication
of
this
question
in
the
court.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
by
cross
reference,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
collective
agreements
provide
that
the
provisions
of
the
plan
--
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
cross
reference
includes
general
electric’s
insurance
plan.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
had
been
changed,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
this
has
not
been
changed.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
at
least
in
recent
years.
it
goes
back
at
least
14,
15
years
that
it
has
been
entirely
company
financed.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well,
in
adverse
decision
here
would
of
course
obliterate
whatever
might
happen
at
the
collective
arena
and
not
particularly,
no.
i
think
in
short,
some
do
and
some
do
not,
this
is
true
in
plans
across
the
land
but
the
significance
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here
today
is
the
impacting
on
not
only
plans
in
existence
but
those
that
have
never
come
to
fruition
and
which
well,
might
not.
thank
you
very
much.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
little
time
i
have
left.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
if
i
may
very
briefly
touch
on
several
points
here.
the
counsel
for
respondent
failed
to
note
that
the
ge
job
evaluation
manual
relating
to
rates
for
men
and
women,
applied
only
to
a
ge
plant
in
erie,
new
york,
and
this
manual
was
prepared
in
1937.
the
gerard
swope
dialogue
to
which
attention
has
been
called
occurred
in
1931.
these
of
course
were
different
times.
counsel
noted
i
believe
that
the
average
rate
of
earnings
for
females
in
the
country
is
approximately
60%
that
of
males.
at
general
electric
as
the
record
shows
that
rate
is
75%
and
general
electric
has
never
had
an
equal
pay
charge
sustained
against
it
in
terms
of
discrimination
in
rates
of
employment.
counsel
noted
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
she
characterizes
as
chicken
feed.
well,
the
record
without
dispute
shows
that
the
cost
to
american
industry
at
the
time
of
trial
for
the
40%
of
the
workforce
covered
by
plants,
with
no
regard
to
the
other
60%,
would
run
at
the
time
of
trial
at
the
rate
of
one
billion,
three
hundred
and
fifty-three
million
dollars
a
year,
and
of
course
with
inflation
that
figure
would
be
higher
today.
in
the
counsel’s
brief
there
is
considerable
reference
to
ge’s
alleged
discriminatory
attitude.
i
think
that
contention
was
obliterated
here
in
the
oral
argument
by
counsel’s
statement
that
ge
provides
to
cradle
to
grave
protection,
and
may
i
note
this
is
for
men
and
women
with
the
sole
exception
of
pregnancy-related
disabilities
and
with
that
kind
of
protection
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
i
suggest
that
ge
has
a
discriminatory
attitude
toward
women
generally.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
i
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
congress’
power.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
this
is
the
underlying
question,
your
honor
or
to
put
in
differently,
when
the
congress
in
1964
enacted
title
vii,
did
it
contemplate
the
obliteration
of
the
pregnancy
disability
differences
that
existed
in
virtually
every
insurance
plan
in
effect
on
the
american
industrial
scene
and
i
think
apropos
of
the
root
question
here
is
the
fact
the
eeoc,
not
until
1972
articulated
this
point
of
view
from
the
beginnings,
although
the
act
was
enacted
in
’64,
it
was
not
effective
until
june,
'65,
but
from
the
early
days,
as
i
noted
yesterday,
the
opinions
of
the
eeoc’s
general
counsel,
the
view
was
this
kind
of
an
exclusion
was
not
discriminatory
because
pregnancy
and
disabilities
related
were
sui
generis,
and
not
until
’72
did
the
complete
about
face
occurred.
and
we
suggest
to
you,
if
the
court
please
that
this
being
a
non-contemporaneous
determination
by
the
commission,
it
is
not
entitled
to
deference,
as
your
dissent,
mr.
justice
stevens,
suggested
in
spogus
in
the
seventh
circuit.
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
i
am
going
full
circle
now
that
the
folks
with
whom
you
spend
your
evening
last
night
have
the
right
to
do
it.
we
say
simply
they
have
not
done
it
and
with
a
matter
of
this
impact
on
the
american
industrial
scene,
we
say
simply
that
they
are
the
one
who
ought
to
do
it.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
they
could
have
said
precisely
that.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
agree,
but
i
note
again
that
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
from
1966
until
1972
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
this
is
’76,
but
the
congress
has
not
changed
the
law?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
well,
here
again
we
are
going
full
circle
and
it
gets
back
to
the
matter
of
legislative
content.
one
final
note
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
am
aware
of
none,
your
honor.
but
this
leads
to
another
point
which
i
think
is
relevant
and
which
i
would
like
to
touch
on.
the
legislative
history
of
equal
rights
amendment
deals
with
this
problem.
indeed
in
our
main
brief
we
have
documented
the
in-depth
that
legislative
history.
the
majority
report
of
the
senate
commission
of
the
judiciary
era
had
this
to
say;
equality
does
not
mean
seamless.
as
a
result
the
resolution,
this
is
the
era
resolution,
would
not
prohibit
reasonable
classifications
based
on
characteristics
that
are
unique
to
one
sex
and
in
the
legislative
debate,
congresswoman
griffiths
who
i
noted
was
quoted
in
the
star
last
night,
had
this
to
say;
era
would
not
affect
laws
dealing
with
a
physical
characteristic
unique
to
one
sex,
such
as
childbearing,
sperm
donation,
or
criminal
acts
capable
of
being
committed
by
members
of
only
one
sex.
so
i
suggest
in
terms
of
what
the
thinking
maybe
in
the
halls
of
congress,
this
distinction
has
been
kept
in
mind
and
there
is
thorough
awareness
of
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
on
reargument
as
it
was
the
issue
last
january,
is
whether
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disabilities
from
an
employer’s
disability
income
protection
plan
is
violative
of
the
effects
proscription
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
general
electric
in
its
comprehensive
insurance
program
has
an
income
protection
plan
in
affect
since
prior
to
1950
which
provides
benefits
to
employees
who
on
account
of
sickness
or
accident
nonoccupational
incurred
are
absent
from
work.
the
benefits
continue
for
a
maximum
of
26
weeks
and
commence
on
the
eighth
day
in
the
event
of
sickness
first
day
in
the
even
of
accident,
the
maximum
the
60%
of
earnings
with
a
saving
of
$150
per
week.
this
plan
incidentally
dovetails
with
a
long
term
disability
plan
for
the
catastrophic
kind
of
accident
or
illness.
the
plan
excludes
pregnancy
related
disabilities
and
the
reasons,
the
historical
reasons
therefore
and
which
apply
today
can
be
summarized
in
this
fashion.
sickness
and
accident
involves
the
unforeseen,
the
unexpected.
pregnancy
basically
is
a
planned
event,
neither
sickness
nor
accident.
at
general
electric,
the
return
rate
of
employees
absent
because
of
sickness
or
illness
is
in
the
90%
plus
percentile
except
for
pregnancy
where
the
return
rate
is
about
40%.
so,
in
essence
to
provide
this
kind
of
disability
payment
for
pregnancy
disability
would
be
providing
a
kind
of
severance
pay
to
women
only.
additionally
and
the
statistics
are
basically
the
same
at
general
electric
as
across
the
land
under
insurance
plans,
the
cost
of
sna
coverage
for
females
on
the
industrial
theme
where
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disability
runs
about
a
170%
of
male
cause
or
to
put
in
another
way,
for
everyone
$100
expended
for
male
sna
coverage
a
$170
is
expended
for
female
coverage.
if
as
the
undisputed
actuarial
testimony
of
the
trial
indicates.
if
this
pregnancy
exclusion
were
extended
to
six
weeks
coverage,
the
percentage
total
will
run
about
210%
or
$210
expended
for
every
female
on
the
average
is
contrasted
with
the
male
and
if
there
were
unlimited
sealing
on
pregnancy
disability
coverage,
the
total
would
run
between
300%
and
330%.
again
at
trail
the
undisputed
testimony
indicated,
that
to
strike
down,
the
kind
of
elimination
that
we’re
talking
about
here
would
add
annually
to
the
plans
currently
and
affecting
the
country
$1
billion
and
353
million
in
cost.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no
sealing
as
contrasted
with
any
other
sickness
or
illness.
under
ge
for
example,
26
weeks
of
coverage.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
perhaps
the
characterization
is
inaccurate,
but
it
would
be
in
the
same
category
as
other
benefits
under
the
plan.
currently
the
coverage
of
sna
applies
to
perhaps
40%
of
the
american
industrial
workforce
according
to
the
record
and
we
are
talking
only
about
those
plans
because
there
is
no
requirement
that
general
electric
or
any
other
employer
impose
a
plan
with
or
without
pregnancy
disability.
now,
of
the
40%
plan
coverage
the
record
again
demonstrates
that
only
40%
of
those
plans,
40%
of
the
40%
provide
some
kind
of
maternity,
pregnancy
disability
coverage
and
all
goes
to
without
exception
the
sealing
on
it
is
six
weeks.
now,
if
the
eoc
is
right
in
this
situation,
that
six
week
sealing
falls
by
the
wayside,
there
can
be
no
distinction
as
to
total
amount
available
and
this
is
one
of
the
difficult
cost
implications
that
give
rise
to
deep
concern.
in
the
insurance
industry
practice
with
respect
to
individual
insurance
policies,
sna
policies
is
a
very
simple
one,
it
excludes
pregnancy
related
disabilities.
on
the
simple
theory,
that
if
such
an
individual
plan
were
available
to
females,
the
insurance
would
be
procured
after
marriage
or
when
a
pregnancy
was
planned
and
this
would
obliterate
the
underlying
concept
of
what
insurance
in
this
area
is
all
about,
protect
against
the
unforeseen,
the
unplanned,
the
unexpected.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
under
individual
policies.
yes.
with
respect
to
group
coverage
this
is
not
the
case
your
honor,
there
are
as
i
noted
the
40%
of
the
policies
in
effect
provide
some
kind
of
pregnancy
disability
coverage;
the
general
standard
is
six
weeks.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
generally
speaking,
no.
it
is
a
practical
matter
and
i
don’t
want
to
do
come
with
record
here
with
a
cosmetic
surgery
for
example,
where
there
is
no
coverage
under
the
ge
policy
with
respect
to
the
hospital,
surgical
aspect
of
it.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
for
cosmetic
surgery
as
far
as
hospital,
medical
expense
is
concerned,
there’s
coverage
for
the
in
and
out
of
the
hospital
but
with
respect
to
cosmetic
surgery
this
runs
a
day
to
two,
the
heavy
cost
is
what
the
physicians
charge,
the
surgeons
charge
in
that
regard.
the
decision
for
exclusion
of
this
kind
of
coverage
is
as
i
noted,
further
buckers
by
the
unique
nature
of
pregnancy.
essentially
it’s
a
voluntary
thing
as
the
record
gain
points
out
without
dispute
and
this
is
an
expert
for
union
testified,
it
would
be
a
strange
commentary
indeed
if
the
survival
of
the
human
race
depended
upon
sickness.
contraception
in
the
society
which
new
york
times
recently
characterized,
is
one
having
reached
almost
a
100%
level
of
contracepted
control
of
birth,
is
such
that
it’s
the
plan
pregnancy
that
almost
invariably
applies.
to
equate
then,
the
pregnancy
related
situation
with
sickness
and
accident
generally
would
be
a
non-secretors
and
now
we
come
to
geduldig
v.
aiello,
this
courts
decision
in
1974
in
the
california
insurance
case
where
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
held
that
pregnancy
is
unique
and
that
there
was
invoked
not
a
situation
of
dissimilar
treatment,
a
person
similarly
situated
but
rather
the
dealing
with
a
unique
situation
a
sui
generous
situation
pregnancy
with
respect
to
which
there
can
be
no
discrimination
these
are
the
males.
i
should
like
to
comeback
to
geduldig
in
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
touch
now
on
why
we
are
here,
whether
the
congress
in
1964
in
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
contemplated,
the
obliteration
of
this
kind
of
exclusion.
your
honor
is
recall,
i
am
sure
that
the
sex
proscription
surface
for
the
first
time
in
the
house
of
representatives.
the
day
before
the
house
adopted
title
vii.
ironically
the
sex
amendment
came
about
as
the
result
of
the
proposal
by
representative
howard
smith
of
virginia
who
was
an
opponent
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
finally
all
of
the
male
representatives
who
voted
for
the
sex
amendment
ultimately
voted
against
title
vii.
the
legislative
history
is
very
sparse
indeed
as
a
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
in
willingham
and
if
i
may,
i
think
i
can
put
him
focus
more
precisely
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
here
by
giving
this
quote,
last
year
willingham
in
a
sex
plus
case
a
hair-length
case
the
court
said,
“we
find
the
legislative
history
regarding
sex
discrimination
in
conclusive
at
best”
and
may
i
say
this
appears
at
page
13
of
our
supplemental
brief
dated
september
15,
1976.
we
find
the
legislative
history
regarding
sex
discrimination
inconclusive
with
best
and
drop
at
one
conclusion
and
that
by
way
of
negative
inference,
without
more
extensive
consideration
congress
and
all
probability
did
not
intend
for
its
proscription
of
sexual
discrimination
to
have
significant
and
sweeping
implications.
we
should
not
therefore
extend
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
situations
of
questionable
application
without
some
stronger
congressional
mandate.
upon
the
adoption
of
title
vii,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
beginning
in
1965
and
continuing
for
six-and-one-half
years
articulated
the
precise
view
that
we
are
espousing
here
this
morning.
the
view
that
because
pregnancy
is
different,
the
prescriptions
of
title
vii
on
the
sex
subject,
we
are
not
intended
to
reach
pregnancy
exclusions.
now,
i
submit
to
that
contemporaneous
interpretation
by
eeoc
should
be
given
great
wait
and
the
change
which
occurred
in
1972
with
180
degree
reversal
in
the
agency
abuse
should
be
ignored
to
put
it
another
way,
we
suggest
that
they
were
right
in
the
first
place.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no
indeed
not,
the
parties
could
so
bargain
indeed
is,
i
am
sure
you
will
here
from
my
distinguished
opponent.
the
union
has
asked
for
such
a
change
during
the
course
of
bargaining
over
the
years
and
the
union
of
course
has
asked
for
many
other
things
their
demands
have
been
innovative,
to
say
the
least.
now
i
think
clearly
this
is
a
matter
for
collective
bargaining,
the
parties
elect
to
distribute
a
larger
portion
of
the
benefit
dollar
to
this
area,
they
could
so
do,
but
this
would
be
on
the
basis
of
consideration
as
to
what
is
appropriate
in
terms
of
dividing
the
benefit
dollar.
if
i
may
return
briefly
now
to
geduldig
v.
aiello,
footnote
20
in
that
decision
which
articulates
the
sui
generous
nature
of
pregnancy
and
pregnancy
related
disabilities.
this
is
been
a
subject
of
great
deal
of
consideration
and
writing
not
only
by
the
courts
but
in
the
law
schools
and
very
recently
also
arthur
larson
a
former
under
secretary
of
commerce
and
now
against
be
duke
professor
of
law
at
duke
university
has
published
book
not
available
at
the
time
but
the
original
argument
in
which
he
expresses
--
i
think
expresses
very
subsequently,
the
consideration
that
are
involved
here,
as
he
puts
it
a
supreme
court
adoption
of
the
eeoc
rule,
would
on
the
strength
of
a
statute
aimed
and
not
at
social
or
private
insurance
reform
but
at
employment
discrimination
change
all
this,
rearrange
insurance
priorities
in
categories
and
markedly
order
the
allocation
of
the
limited
resources
available
for
wage
loss,
hospital
and
medical
benefits.
a
way
from
both
the
creators
and
the
beneficiaries
of
those
plans,
very
often
the
view
is
suggested
that
in
smoke-filled
rooms
decisions
are
made
which
discriminate.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
collective
bargaining
and
in
decision
making
on
the
part
of
management
in
an
organized
operations;
what
is
the
appropriate
allocation
of
the
benefit
dollar
indeed
the,
how
does
one
divide
the
pie
if
you
will
in
terms
of
the
fringe
benefits,
wage
increases,
cost
of
living
adjustment,
etcetera.
these
decisions
are
arrived
at
in
this
sector
as
a
result
of
careful
consideration,
no
effort
at
discrimination
but
a
desire
to
do
what
is
best
for
the
largest
number
and
professor
larson
points
out
the
ultimate
decision
here,
the
non-extension
of
pregnancy
benefits
to
women
really
relates
to
the
family
unit.
there
is
a
father
for
every
child,
the
head
of
the
household
perhaps
and
it
is
the
allocation
of
that
money
to
apply
for
the
greatest
benefits
for
all
involved,
it
is
the
underlying
decision
and
because
the
family
unit
is
in
the
majority
obviously
any
decision
that
can
be
characterized
discriminatory.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
no,
this
is
hammered
out
on
a
case
by
case,
contract
by
contract
basis.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
in
this
incidence,
in
this
case?
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
oh,
sure
this
demand
has
been
made
over
the
years,
along
with
many
other
demands
as
i
noted
the
union
is
most
likely
--
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
they
have
participated
in
these
decisions
because
ultimately
the
panoply
what
is
asked
for
is
so
broad
and
all
encompassing,
it
is
what
is
finally
hammered
out
is
what
really
counts
and
with
respect
to
what
is
finally
hammered
out
the
union
signature
is
on
the
line.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
precisely.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
might
have
add
finally
that
under
the
equal
pay
act
and
under
executive
order
11246,
the
rule
of
the
eeoc
here
ascribes
for
is
not
recognized,
equal
contributions
under
benefit
plans
are
surprise
and
may
i
note
again
that
with
respect
to
pregnancy
disability,
it
is
not
only
a
matter
of
equal
contributions
but
the
amount
that
goes
to
females
very
substantially
exceeds
that
which
is
available
to
males.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
suspect
the
argument
would
surface
very
swift
that
either
this
was
discriminatory,
i
should
add
that
earlier
this
year
and
again
not
available
at
the
time
of
the
original
argument.
the
new
york
state
department
of
the
insurance
issued
an
in
depth
report
on
insurance
cost,
we
have
logged
it
with
a
court,
it
is
available
here
and
it
demonstrate
several
things.
number
one,
it
supports
clearly
and
precisely
the
position
initially
articulated
that,
female
cost
is
much
higher.
this
report
finds.
it
notes
also
for
example
that
because
of
the
longer
life
of
females
on
the
average,
pension
cost,
annuity
cost
is
run
about
25%
higher
for
females
and
for
males.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes
your
honor.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
washington
v.
davis
was
a
race
case.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
but
this
court
has
never
held
sex
as
a
suspect
classification.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes,
we
think
that
footnote
20
clearly
points
out
that
there
is
no
sex
discrimination
in
our
case.
therefore
the
reach
of
washington
v.
davis
simply
could
not
apply
and
again
i
know
we
suggest
as
i
am
sure
is
in
the
minds
of
your
honors
the
proposition
that
sex
is
not
inherently
suspect.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
it
does
not
if
you
agree
with
our
initial
concept,
there
is
no
discrimination
involved.
thank
you.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
think
sickle
cell
anemia
would
be
in
a
different
category
from
what
i
know
about
the
medical
writings
on
this
subject.
this
is
a
disease
suffered
only
by
blacks.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
one
but
i
think
the
same
answer
would
apply.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
oh,
i
think
it
could.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
i
will
give
the
short
answer,
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
by
blacks.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
could
not.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
because
we
are
dealing
on
the
one
hand
with
race
and
on
the
other
with
sex.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
the
court
has,
your
honor...
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
in
the
light
of
legislative
history,
title
vii
i
suggest
the
identical
rules
should
apply.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
that
is
the
underlying
position
that
its
childbirth
pregnancy
is
a
natural
thing,
medical
testimony
on
the
record
indicated
that
in
most
instances,
it
contributes
to
the
well
being
of
the
mother,
its
not
a
disease
as
dr.
hilger
pointed
out
because
it
would
be
said
indeed,
if
we
all
survived
on
the
basis
of
sickness,
it
is
a
sui
generous
unique,
different
onto
itself
kind
of
condition.
thank
you.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
in
my
view
we
have
--
there
is
no
prima
facie
burden.
we
establish
a
rational
relationship,
we
establish
the
sex
aspect
of
it
and
there
is
no
burden
approve
on
us.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
several
very
quick
comments
and
i
should
like
to
address
the
observations
of
counsel
regarding
what
happens
with
collective
bargaining
people.
members
of
the
court
in
the
real
world
out
there,
you
do
not
take
it
away
and
the
reference
is
inappropriate.
secondly,
as
we
note
in
the
supplemental
brief
dated
september
15,
1976,
the
position
of
deputy
solicitor
general
lawrence
wallace,
when
he
appeared
before
you
in
oral
argument
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer
seems
rather
clearly
to
embrace
the
view
of
aiello,
which
we
have
articulated
here
this
morning.
he
says
the
–
well,
i’m
not
going
to
bore
you
with
reading
what
we
quote
but
on
pages
8
to
9
of
this
supplemental
brief
we
note
what
the
solicitor’s
office
says
there
and
i
suggest
it’s
quite
different
from
what
we
heard
here
this
morning.
finally,
a
very
brief
reference,
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
sickle
cell
anemia,
this
is
an
area
that
we
have
not
covered
in
any
of
our
briefs
and
i
should
like
to
note
again
that
pregnancy
is
the
only
physical
condition
which
is
unique
to
one
sex
and
as
i
understand
the
sickle
cell
situation
it’s
in
an
opposite
because
most
blacks
are
immune
to
it.
finally
it’s
sickness
as
i
understand
it
and
not
a
unique
condition
like
pregnancy.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
yes
mr.
theophil
c.
kammholz
thank
you.
