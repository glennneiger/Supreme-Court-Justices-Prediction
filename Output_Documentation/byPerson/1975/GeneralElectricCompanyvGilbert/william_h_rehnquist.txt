justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
respondent
to
me
is
a
--
a
consolidated
cases
where
women
employed
by
general
electric
in
a
plant
at
salem,
virginia,
which
is
located
over
in
the
shenandoah
valley,
they
brought
this
class
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
asserting
that
the
disability
benefits
program
which
ge
had
established
for
its
employees
discriminated
against
women
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
ge's
program
provided
payments
to
employees
who
are
totally
disabled
as
a
result
of
non-occupational
sickness
or
accident,
but
it
did
not
provide
coverage
for
employees
whose
disabilities
are
pregnancy
related.
in
this
exclusion,
it
was
challenged
in
this
lawsuit.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
respondent,
the
plaintiff
and
held
that
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disability
constituted
sex
discrimination
in
violation
of
title
vii.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari
in
order
to
consider
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
concluding
that
petitioner's
program
violated
title
vii.
for
the
reason
set
forth
and
an
opinion
which
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
following
our
decision
three
terms
ago
in
the
case
of
geduldig
against
aiello,
which
dealt
with
the
validity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
similar
plan,
we
now
hold
that
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disabilities
from
a
program
such
as
petitioner's
does
not
in
itself
demonstrates
sex
discrimination
in
violation
of
title
vii.
and
since
respondent
did
not
otherwise
show
that
the
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disabilities
had
a
just
proportion
of
the
fact
on
one
sex
as
compared
with
the
other,
we
conclude
that
respondents
are
not
entitled
for
the
release
they
seek.

justice
stewart
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed

opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.

filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
