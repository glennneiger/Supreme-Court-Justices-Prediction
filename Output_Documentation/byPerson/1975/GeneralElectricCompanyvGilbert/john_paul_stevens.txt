mr.
kammholz,
while
you
are
interrupted,
let
me
just
get
a
thought
that
has
been
troubling
me
up
in
my
mind.
here
the
burden
of
your
argument
on
cost
is
to
eliminate
what
your
opponents
contend
as
a
discriminatory
feature
or
your
plan
would
impose
a
cost
on
your
client
that
would
have
--
may
be
15%
or
20%
whatever
it
is,
to
make
everything
equal
in
their
terms.
is
it
not
fair
to
assume
that
eliminating
the
wage
differential
that
the
statute
required,
i
think
we
must
assume
there
was
a
wage
differential
before
the
statute
was
passed,
imposed
a
comparable
cost
on
the
company,
on
industry
generally?
and
how
is
this
really
different
in
overall
policy
terms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
cost
feature
really
is
irrelevant
to
the
basic
dispute,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask,
the
fifty-one
day
figure,
is
that
including
the
pregnancy
disability
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
included
the
pregnancy
disability
what
would
it
comparative
figures
be,
does
the
record
show?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
you
add
the
forty-two
to
the
fifty-one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
other
legislation
that
requires
equal
pay
for
equal
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
had
a
wholly
male
workforce,
some
would
be
paid
more
than
others
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that
would
be
the
higher
paying
jobs
than
others
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
a
wholly
female
workforce
the
same
thing
would
be
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
plenty
of
legislation
requiring
equal
pay
for
equal
work,
so
i
do
not
really
see
the
point
of
what
you
are
--
