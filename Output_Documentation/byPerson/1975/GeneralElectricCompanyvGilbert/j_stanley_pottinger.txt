mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
your
honor,
i
have
not
addressed
the
rules
specifically.
it
was
my
understanding
that
we
were
permitted
to
argue
amicus
and
by
letter
to
the
clerk
and
the
court
we
are
grated
that
permission.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
certainly
it
is,
if
not
by
direction
by
indirection,
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we
have
presented
today
is
the
following
fact
situation
against
which
title
vii
must
be
measured.
we
have
a
disability
plan
by
general
electric
which
seeks
to
cover
virtually
all
disabilities
for
men
and
women
except
one.
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
the
voluntariness
of
pregnancy.
let
us
examine
for
a
moment
however
the
coverage
of
voluntary
as
well
as
involuntary
disabilities
for
men
virtually
every
disability
including
voluntary
disabilities
as
they
affect
men
are
covered
by
this
plan
that
includes
everything
from
cosmetic
surgery
as
noted
to
suicide
to
felonies
or
the
results
of
felonies
to
voluntary
sports
activities
to
falling
of
ladders.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes
it
is.
there
is
no
distinction
in
other
words
as
to
voluntariness
or
involuntariness
in
this
plan
with
the
exception
and
therefore
i
think
to
say
that
the
plan
is
misdirected
toward
voluntariness
of
pregnancy
is
purely
misleading.
the
purpose
of
title
vii
however
is
to
provide
equal
opportunity
in
the
job
market
by
excluding
in
various
forms
of
discrimination
including
sex
and
we
believe
that
given
the
legislative
history
and
interpretations
of
the
court,
clearly
two
different
theories
would
sustain
a
prima
facie
case
of
sex
discrimination
in
this
case.
first,
the
exclusion
in
this
particular
case
is
not
neutral
on
its
face.
it
does
single
out
a
condition
which
is
so
inextricably
sex-linked
to
women
that
it
is
tantamount
to
a
policy
of
excluding
women
from
this
otherwise
total
coverage.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
have
been
calling
geduldig
v
aiello.
i
am
not
sure
that’s
right
either.
we
are
on
footnote
20,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
because
that
was
based
on
a
fourteenth
amendment
theory
not
on
a
statutory
theory,
we
think
that
that’s
persuasive
distinction
and
that
this
court
itself
is
recognized
in
washington
v.
davis.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes,
definitely.
i
would
like
to
address
that
same
issue
in
this
case
if
i
may.
the
actuarial
issue
in
aiello
however
was
set
in
the
context
of
estate
social
welfare
program
where
the
court
found
that
it
was
rational.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
believe
that
aiello
said
that
under
those
circumstances
it
was
rational
to
conclude
that
it
was
not
sex
discrimination.
yet
under
title
vii,
this
court
also
found
in
a
very
similar
situation
that
it
is
rational
under
griggs.
the
griggs
case
made
it
clear
that
if
there
is
an
impact,
the
consequences,
predictable
consequences
of
a
policy
of
exclusion,
if
it
falls
on
a
protected
class,
here
women,
does
cost
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
believe
that
it
was
talking
more
broadly,
was
it
not
about--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
the
holding
did
but
(voice
overlap)
and
with
race
griggs
has
been
cited
however
as
president
both
for
sex
cases
in
as
in
your
question
and
more
broadly
it
has
been
properly
cited
as
president
for
any
device
or
selection
activity
or
exclusion
activity
not
just
from
hiring
but
device
or
employment
device
or
standard
or
criteria,
which
excludes
or
has
an
adverse
impact
on
a
protected
class.
i
think
it
goes
beyond
hiring.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
think
that
this
holding
does
apply
beyond
the
issue
of
hiring;
it
is
what
i
am
saying.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
understand
that
the
facts
make
the
holding
applicable
in
that
case
to
hiring
but
the
principle
stated
by
the
court
in
griggs
clearly
goes
to
the
issue
of
what
constituted
discrimination
in
hiring.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
there
is
not.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
that’s
correct
and
a
progeny
of
griggs
however,
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
only
a
gloss;
it
seems
to
me
that
both
eeoc
practice,
administrative
guidelines
and
the
deference
that
we
pay
to
those
and
this
courts
decision
in
griggs
are
also--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
yes
it
is.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
pardon
me,
guidelines
in
this
particular
case.
however,
the
court
has
held
that
deference
should
be
paid
to
the
guidelines
and
we
think
that
that
is
sensible.
either
under
a
theory
which
would
state
that
there
is
an
inextricable
relationship
between
race
and
the
exclusionary
factor
or
sex
in
the
exclusionary
factor,
for
instance,
sickle
cell
anemia
or
under
the
impact
theory
of
griggs.
in
either
case,
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out.
now,
i
notice
the
counselor
concedes
before
you
today
that
if
sickle
cell
anemia
were
before
the
court
that
could
not
be
excluded,
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
logical
or
rational
distinction
under
title
vii
not
under
aiello,
not
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
under
title
vii
between
an
exclusion
of
sickle
cell
anemia,
which
we
admit
could
not
lawfully
take
place
and
the
exclusion
of
sex
related
practices
or
disabilities
such
as
pregnancy,
i
fail
to
see
the
distinction.
therefore,
we
are
faced
with
only
two
defenses
or
rather
arguments
in
defense.
one
is
aiello
which
we
have
just
–
i
have
attempted
the
deal
with
here.
the
other
is
the
business
necessity
or
cost
factor
and
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
particular
case,
cost
cannot
be
a
controlling
factor
in
this
decision.
first
of
all,
in
the
courts
below
general
electric
refused
to
present
a
business
necessity
defense
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
presented
cost
factors
not
for
purposes
of
showing
that
the
cost
would
be
too
high
and
indeed
the
admission
that
40%
of
those
industries
that
do
provide
these
benefits
have
not
gone
broke,
have
not
shut
down
their
plans.
it
seems
to
me
to
give
the
light
to
the
theory
that
it
ever
could
be
too
high.
so
the
business
necessity
defense
is
not
even
presented
to
the
court.
however,
it
comes
in
the
back
door
right
now
it
seems
to
me
by
arguing
in
this
fashion
by
raising
the
horrors
of
cost.
yet
clearly
we
do
not
need
to
find
at
this
program
in
order
to
be
sustained,
must
provide
a
cost
that
would
literally
shut
down
the
plant.
that
is
not
an
issue;
it’s
a
red
herring
here.
as
for
the
notion
that
the
six
weeks
coverage
would
have
to
be
extended
clearly
what
we
are
talking
about
and
what
counsel
for
–-
appellate
is
talking
about
is
a
coverage
that
arises
from
sickness
or
involuntary
disability
arising
after
in
normal
pregnancy.
no
one
is
suggesting,
and
not
is
the
counsel
for
general
electric
suggesting
that
there
would
be
up
to
26
weeks
of
benefits
for
a
normal
pregnancy.
yet
under
the
general
electric
plan
even
an
involuntary
illness,
an
unpredictable
illness
that
is
pregnancy
related
would
not
be
covered
at
all
much
less
would
have
been
covered
on
a
basis
that
is
similar
to
that
which
men
have
under
the
disability
program.
they
are
excluding
both
the
voluntary,
if
you
will,
aspects
of
pregnancy
and
the
normal
aspects
and
the
involuntary
or
abnormal
aspects
of
pregnancy
alike.
yet
it
presents
no
cost
figures
whatsoever
on
how
often
abnormalities
will
arise
and
how
much
they
would
cost,
instead
it
refers
to
industry
wide
figures
that
we
would
submit
or
in
opposite
to
the
problems
faced
by
ge
or
indeed
by
the
40%
of
companies
that
have
done
this
successfully.
there
are
ways,
in
fact,
dealing
with
the
cost
issue.
the
courts
have
held
that
cost
itself
is
not
a
defense
to
discrimination
where
a
case
is
made
out
and
we
agree
with
that
and
we
also
agree
that
the
cost
factors
could
be
raised
only
in
the
event
that
a
business
necessity
defense
could
be
raised
and
again
that
is
not
either
been
tendered
before
this
court
this
morning
or
in
either
of
the
courts
below
despite
ample
opportunity
to
do
so.
what
we
are
faced
with
is
a
situation
where
general
electric
has
provided,
has
such
provide
an
umbrella
of
coverage
and
yet
it
has
plucked
out
one
single
activity
from
that
umbrella
and
placed
it
in
the
rain.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
an
activity
which
is
not
or
rather
a
disability
which
is
not
been
shown
to
be
more
expansive,
for
instance,
than
one
that
males
face
and
indeed
the
record
will
indicate
that
in
the
insurance
area
as
opposed
to
disability
coverage,
men
in
ge
costs
to
the
company
much
more
than
women.
the
insurance
program
cost
them
more
if
we
were
to
find
that
respiratory
diseases
or
heart
disease
or
other
specific
diseases
were
actuarially
defined
and
the
company
wanted
to
take
those
into
account
to
keep
the
integrity
of
cost
factors
at
a
minimum,
that
would
be
another
issue
but
that
is
not
what
they
propose
to
do
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
once
the
company
undertakes
as
general
electric
has
to
create
a
broad
umbrella
of
coverage.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
that
is
correct.
however,
i
think
that
counsel’s
use
of
the
170%
figure
is
itself
a
bid
of
a
red
herring.
the
male
coverage
figures
that
he
presents
are
not
related
directly
to
the
cost
factors
that
would
arise
in
ge
on
a
comparative
basis
with
pregnancy
that
was
normally
judged
as
opposed
to
this
26
or
open
ended
judgment.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
no,
i
think
the
cost
could
make
a
difference
but
clearly
in
this
case,
it
does
not
make
a
difference
and
has
not
--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
i
would
use
the
(inaudible)
test
that
states
that
in
a
business
necessity
way,
if
the
safety
or
efficiency
of
the
company
were
at
stake--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
and
if
it
was
interposed
which
it
was
not
interposed
in
this
case
even
though—
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
as
i
believe
it
is
703
(g)
or
(j)
i
believe.
the
statute
allows
for
what
amounts
to
a
business
necessity
result
or
rather
argument
but
may
i
simply
say
that
with
regard
to
the
cost
factor,
the
business
necessity
defense
itself
makes
clear
that
only
if
it’s
necessary
to
--
only
if
the
one
cost
interposed
is
necessary
and
would
result
in
disabling
of
the
company,
would
this
factor
arise.
here,
there
are
other
ways
in
which
the
company
could
cover
normal
and
even
abnormal
pregnancies
without
the
necessity
for
eliminating
this
entire
program.
it
could,
for
instance,
reduce
the
amount
of
payments,
elsewhere
it
could,
for
instance,
eliminate
coverage
that
runs
across
sex
line
such
as
respiratory
diseases
arising
from
smoking
in
men
and
women
alike.
it
could
reduce
the
amount
of
payment
in
terms
of
the
time
it
pays.
it
could
take
any
number
of
innovative
approaches
to
cover--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
well,
i
think
that
in
light
of
as
long
as
this
court
sits,
and
as
long
as
this
court
is
able
to
recognize,
it
will.
if
it
does
recognize
that
this
form
of
discrimination,
can
it
go
forward,
i
think
they
are
realistic.
i
think
in
the
absence
of
the
rule--
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
it
seems
to
me
that
if
–
yes,
i
think
so,
if
the
company
can
show
that
the
absence
of
such
a
reduction
is
to
close
down
the
plant
or
otherwise
disable
the
company,
i
would
say
that
that’s
a
possibility
that’s
reasonable
and
what’s
i’m
saying
further
is
that
is,
in
fact,
in
law
the
only
basis
upon
which
the
company
can
go
either
to
court
or
to
the
union
in
the
collective
bargaining
system
and
say
we
must
make
a
change
in
order
to
accommodate
pregnancy
disability
programs.
in
the
absence
of
showing
that
high
standard
of
need,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chances
are
not
great
but
on
the
other
hand
they
need
not
be
great
because
the
company
will
not
be
faced
with
the
disabling
cost
factor.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
thank
you.
