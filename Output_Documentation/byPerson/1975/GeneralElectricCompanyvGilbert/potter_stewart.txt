or
unless
the
statute
--
unless
he
is
contractually
bound?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kammholz,
what
we
are
ultimately
concerned
with
in
this
case,
i
think
you
would
agree
is
the
problem
of
statutory
construction?
justice
potter
stewart
the
interpretation
of
the
law
enacted
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
not
with
question
of
congress’
constitutional
power
or
with
any
constitutional
renovation,
but
simply
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
you
would
agree
as
a
matter
of
power,
i
suppose
that
congress
could
provide,
if
it
were
so
minded
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
explicitly
provide
that
no
employer
in
interstate
commerce
shall
discriminate
between
the
sexes
in
his
employment
practices
as
congress
has
provided
in
this
act
and
then
to
go
on
to
say
explicitly,
and
this
means
that
if
an
employer
in
interstate
commerce
has
a
disability
benefits
program,
the
employer
shall
not
exclude
the
disability
of
women
occasioned
by
their
pregnancy.
would
you
have
any
doubt
of
congress’
power
to
enact
such
as
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
question
is
here
whether
the
law
enacted
by
congress
as
construed
by
the
commission
is
equivalent
to
the
enactment
that
i
had
just
hypothesized,
would
you
say
that
is
the
basic
question
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
been
any
proposed
legislation
to
make
this
specific
as
a
matter
of
law
in
the
wake
of
the
good
geduldig
case,
particularly?
