ms.
ruth
weyand
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
ruth
weyand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
unlike
the
liberty
mutual
case
preceding
it,
as
attorneys
for
the
plaintiffs,
we
elected
and
made
a
deliberate
choice
to
make
as
full
a
record
as
we
possibly
could
to
approve
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
evidence
that
to
fail,
to
maintain
the
income
of
women
who
were
disabled
by
childbirth
or
complication
of
pregnancy
was
in
fact
discrimination
because
of
sex
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
we
went
into
and
introduced
the
full
history
of
the
plan.
we
gave
and
we
produced
annual
reports
of
general
electric
going
back
to
1928.
the
plan
was
voluntarily
instituted
as
part
of
a
large
insurance
program,
including
life
insurance
in
1925.
we
have
speeches
in
the
record
of
gerard
swope
who
was
then
president
of
ge,
who
explained
that
the
whole
life
insurance
program
was
not
offered
to
women
because
they
did
not
understand
the
responsibilities
of
life,
they
just
got
married
and
had
children.
we
have
that
from
his
biographer,
we
have
it
from
his
speech
at
annals
of
the
american
academy.
ms.
ruth
weyand
yes,
yes,
i
am
bringing
it
down
to
date.
however,
we
went
through
what
they
said
in
the
annual
reports
and
speeches
of
o&d
young
and
later
presidents
and
so
on
and
came
down
to
date.
the
plan
as
it
stands,
as
it
stood,
in
1950
when
the
union
first
became
the
bargaining
agent,
which
was
not
the
beginning
of
the
plan,
but
was
the
first
year
in
which
the
international
year
of
electrical
radio
and
machine
workers
bargained,
it
was
the
first
year
in
which
any
union
in
the
united
states
was
accepted
as
a
bargaining
representative
with
regard
to
fringe
benefits.
you
may
remember
the
inman
steel
cases
cited
here.
it
was
decided
in
1948
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
as
to
the
fringe
benefit
issue,
there
were
other
issues
on
non-communist
affidavit
in
the
case,
which
were
reviewed
here,
but
in
the
fringe
benefit,
that
was
the
first
year.
and
the
international
union
at
that
time
pointed
out
to
ge
that
this
exclusion
of
women
who
were
disabled
by
childbirth
in
pregnancy
was
discriminatory
as
to
women,
that
general
motors
one
of
the
large
competitors
of
ge,
did
pay
for
six
weeks
and
other
many
companies
paid,
and
this
demand
was
repeated
at
the
bargaining
table
down
to
through
the
years.
and
ge
keeps
--
refused
to
discuss
the
cost
of
this
item
with
the
iue.
we
have
a
decision
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
second
circuit,
in
1969
which
is
cited
in
our
record,
where
we
have
in
the
record
where
we
asked
about
maternity,
company
said
that
is
the
most
costly
item.
the
union
says
what
does
it
cost?
ge
says
we
do
not
bargain
cost,
we
bargain
level
of
benefits.
we
do
what
is
right,
and
we
have
the
minutes
down
through
the
years
where
that
has
been
the
position
of
ge.
in
the
last
round
of
negotiations,
which
occurred
after
this
suit
was
begun,
and
the
evident
record
--
what
happened
there
is
in
the
record,
ge
gave
the
union
an
indemnity
agreement
going
back
to
the
preceding
two
agreements.
the
idr
(ph)
position
was
that
as
a
matter
of
law
we
were
entitled
to
this
and
there
was
no
need
to
disrupt
commerce
by
a
strike
or
anything
to
get
it,
so
--
and
ge
recognized
it
would
be
settled
by
the
courts.
there
is
no
element
of
estoppel
about
the
union
acquiescing
in
this.
it
was
understood
at
the
bargaining
table
we
were
trying
it
out
in
court,
we
thought
we
had
a
right
to
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
case
was
--
this
suit
was
instituted
in
the
court
below
prior
to
the
guidelines.
and
the
eeoc,
from
the
very
beginning
taken
the
position
and
since
first
annual
report
which
is
cited
in
our
record
that
discrimination
because
of
pregnancy
was
discrimination
because
of
sex
and
had
issued
decisions
prior
to
the
guidelines
holding
that
failure
to
pay
disability
benefits
and
this
case
was
filed
on
march
15,
1972
in
the
federal
district
court
in
virginia,
prior
to
the
issuance
of
guidelines.
the
plan
itself
discriminates
a
regard
to
pregnancy
not
only
by
failing
to
pay
any
benefits
for
normal
childbirth,
any
benefits
for
any
complication
of
childbirth,
but
it
also
discontinues
all
coverage
when
a
woman
leaves
the
plant
because
of
pregnancy.
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here,
emma
furch,
left
the
plant
because
of
a
miscarriage
and
went
home
from
the
hospital.
she
had
a
pulmonary
embolism.
her
doctor
certified
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
pregnancy.
ge
accepted
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
pregnancy,
pulled
out
some
fine
language
of
the
plan,
which
i
am
a
little
bit
embarrassed,
i
did
not
have
in
my
complaint,
i
did
not
realize
there
was
fine
language,
you
canceled
the
whole
plan,
but
they
do
cancel
the
whole
disability
coverage,
and
the
examination
by
judge
marriage
(ph)
is
very
clear
here
and
the
company
admits
that
if
a
male
goes
off
on
a
holiday
or
vacation
and
he
has
an
automobile
accident
two
days
later
and
gets
disabled
he
is
covered,
but
a
woman
leaves
a
plant
because
of
pregnancy,
she
is
not
covered
until
she
returns
to
work
for
anything
not
even
related
to
pregnancy.
the
coverage
here
of
the
plan
for
males
is
all-inclusive.
gerard
swope
on
ge’s
annual
reports
coming
right
down
past
1966,
we
have
1969
one,
1970
and
1972
ones
in,
explains
ge's
theory
that
it
increases
productivity
if
employees
do
not
have
to
worry
about
any
of
certitude
of
life
which
they
may
not
be
able
to
meet.
and
gerard
swope
had
been
president
of
ge
international
before
he
became
president
of
ge
usa,
and
he
tells
in
his
speeches
how
he
had
been
impressed
at
the
higher
productivity
of
the
european
worker,
italy,
germany
and
so
on
because
they
had
the
full
social
security
coverage.
but
he
did
not
want
social
security
coverage
from
government.
he
distrusted
politicians.
he
thought
they
had
always
upped
the
benefits.
he
thought
companies
should
introduce
it
and
that
the
consumer,
their
dollar
benefit
to
the
marketplace
would
determine
how
much
you
could
pay
for
benefit.
you
would
not
run-up
the
cost
like
a
politician
to
get
elected
on
promise
of
an
increase
in
social
security.
and
so
he
instituted
a
cradle
to
grave
plan
that
followed
what
they
had
in
europe.
it
covers
old
age,
covers
supplements
on
employment
insurance,
it
supplements
workman’s
compensation,
it
supplements
--
supplements
social
security,
it
supplements
military
benefits,
it
supplements
everything
that
happens
from
cradle
to
grave
except
when
a
woman
has
a
baby.
it
covers
all
the
expenses
of
a
male
who
has
a
baby.
it
covers
the
hospital
medical
expenses
of
a
woman
too,
but
in
the
record
the
number
of
males
that
had
babies
is
one
in
one-third
times
that
of
the
females.
at
the
rate
we
have
find
it
costs
to
have
babies
today,
i
find
in
cases
i
have
been
trying
around
the
country,
in
steinberg
the
personnel
director
said
$850.00
in
rochester,
combined
hospital
and
medical.
it
cost
$850.00
and
you
took
the
figures
on
the
one
in
one-third
more
babies
per
male
in
the
record
here
in
1972,
you
could
pay
the
women
disability
for
six
weeks
and
the
company
would
still
save
money
on
the
maternity
cost
of
women
here,
you
sit
down
and
you
get
the
figures
on
because
of
increase
cost
to
males.
so,
the
company
has
never
offered
any
figures
as
to
what
disability
will
cost.
ge
has
offered
figures
what
it
thinks
it
is
going
to
cost
all
of
industry
that
we
are
not
here
trying
that,
we
do
not
know
what
other
industry
does.
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
own
actuary
said,
and
it
is
in
the
record,
ge
exhibit
13,
we
cite
in
our
briefs
60%
of
the
women
covered
by
disability
plans
are
today
covered
for
an
average
of
six
weeks
on
disability.
and
the
record
here
is
that
and
ge’s
own
position
is
that
99%
of
the
women
have
only
a
normal
childbirth.
their
figures
in
their
brief
is
one-tenth
to
two-tenth
of
1%
of
women
have
complications,.
it
is
the
way
they
read
the
record,
which
means
99%
of
the
women
have
a
normal
childbirth
and
all
of
the
evidence,
the
findings
of
the
court
below
that
normal
childbirth
is
disabling
for
not
more
than
six
weeks.
as
a
fact,
ge's
medical,
dr.
wilbanks
testified
that
most
women
could
return
in
two
weeks.
he
had
interns
that
did,
that
they
were
back
doing
their
housework,
that
normal
women
where
today
that
social
economic
conditions
are
so
increased
that
there
has
been
change
in
the
whole
physical
structure
of
the
women
in
the
way
they
respond
to
childbirth
and
the
time
with
which
their
organs
respond
because
of
the
increased
medical
and
socio
economic
conditions
and
so
on.
so
we
have
a
very
full
record
here
on
which
the
court
below
found
that
this
was
discriminatory.
it
was
motivated
by
discriminatory
attitude
towards
women,
it
was
discriminatory.
there
are
21
different
findings
where
discriminatory
was
deprived,
voluntarily
to
females
not
to
man,
they
play
--
pay
for
voluntary
hair
transplants,
they
pay
for
voluntary
trick
knees,
they
pay
for
voluntary
cosmetic,
they
maintain
--
disability
meant
they
maintain
income
for
everything
that
happens
to
a
man.
after
i
went
through
and
asked
about
emphysema
and
alcoholism,
alcohol
cures
and
drug,
they
kept
saying
--
i
have
asked
them
have
you
ever
paid
if
you
have
paid
once,
is
it
your
practice
to
pay,
if
it
is
not
your
practice
to
pay
why
did
you
pay
them
and
not
here?
everyone,
that
we
have
paid
everyone
and
i
have
finally
got
grievances,
is
there
anything
a
man
was
ever
disabled
for
that
you
did
not
pay
for,
no.
in
collective
bargaining,
the
first
round,
they
in
1966,
the
first
post
civil
rights
act,
bargaining
session,
ge
claimed
that
the
majority
of
the
women
did
not
return
and
that
was
their
statement
of
why
to
the
union,
they
did
not
think
it
was
appropriate
to
include
sickness
and
accident
benefits.
they
did
not
make
any
such
claim
in
1969
and
the
record
here
shows
that
the
majority
of
women
do
return.
in
fact,
even
though
the
company
in
the
record
here
and
their
findings,
up
until
may
of
1973
required
women
to
go
on
mandatory
leave
three-months,
in
most
of
his
plants,
before
expected
due
date
and
remain
out
two-months
after,
a
five-months
time
which
forces
many
women
to
look
for
other
jobs.
like
in
turner,
they
had
to
look
for
other
jobs,
you
may
recall
the
woman
in
turner
out
of
employment
that
had
gotten
clerical
job,
even
with
all
of
that
60%
of
the
women
came
back
and
’60,
’70
and
’71,
40%
did
not.
the
turnover
rate
in
the
record
is
40%
failure
turnover.
i
want
to
turn
my
attention
now
of
giving
you
the
facts,
the
basic
facts
here,
to
geduldig
versus
aiello
and
its
impact
on
this
case.
title
vii
has
much
broader
language.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
question
of
statutory
construction.
in
the
language
in
title
vii
with
which
we
are
concerned
is
very,
very
broad.
i
want
to
turn
my
attention
just
for
a
moment
to
the
language
under
which
we
--
this
court
must
determine,
which
the
courts
below
determined
that
the
guidelines
were
proper.
we
have
a
decision
by
the
eeoc
in
this
case
which
the
courts
below
gave
deference
to
and
which
seven
courts
of
appeals,
fifteen
district
court
judges
have
indicated
there
is
no
un-reversed
decision
of
any
court,
twenty-four
states,
mvp
agencies,
four
highest
courts
of
states
have
said
it
constitutes
sex
discrimination
not
to
pay
sickness
and
accident
benefits
under
similar
state
statutes.
the
language
703
(a),
the
congress
made
it
unlawful,
in
a1
to
discriminate
with
respect
to
compensation,
terms,
conditions
or
privileges
of
employment.
and
in
2,
to
limit,
segregate,
or
classify
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
--
tend
to
deprive
or
adversely
affect,
you
hardly
get
broader
language
than
that.
the
eeoc,
when
it
came
to
dealing
with
what
to
do
with
pregnancy
and
it
mentions
it
in
its
first
annual
reports,
first
annual
report,
tells
of
having
found
that
discrimination
because
of
pregnancy
is
discrimination.
it
says
the
prohibition
against
sex
discrimination
is
especially
difficult
to
apply
with
respect
to
female
employees
who
become
pregnant.
in
all
other
questions
involving
sex
discrimination,
the
underlying
principle
is
essentially
equality
of
treatment.
then
it
says,
the
commission
decided
to
carry
out
the
congressional
policy
of
providing
truly
equal
employment
opportunities,
including
career
opportunities
for
women,
policies
would
have
to
be
devised
which
afforded
female
employees
reasonable
job
protection
during
periods
of
pregnancy.
during
1975,
there
were
thirty-seven
million
working
--
women
working
in
united
states.
ge's
exhibit
13,
the
same
exhibit
shows
60%
of
the
women
covered
by
disability
benefits
have
coverage
for
six
weeks
shows
that
40%
of
the
pregnant
women
in
the
united
states
were
in
jobs
outside
their
home
and
gained
full
employment
in
1968.
studies
of
why
women
have
low
wage
rates,
why
they
have
four
jobs,
have
focused
on
the
lack
of
continuity
of
employment.
and
although
this
court
in
cleveland
board
of
education
versus
la
fleur
dealt
with
state
action
on
the
due
process
basis,
that
does
not
apply
to
private
employers
and
unless
--
unless
it
is
sex
discrimination,
under
title
vii,
the
employer
may
discharge
a
woman
the
minute
she
gets
pregnant.
there
is
nothing
to
protect
her.
this
court
had
repeatedly
said
that
an
employer
can
fire
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
unless
there
is
statute,
said
it
in
the
jones
and
laufman
(ph)
case.
unless
--
ms.
ruth
weyand
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
now,
i
must
say
that
the
unions
over
the
years
and
our
union
with
ge
has
gotten
protection
with
ge
on
everything
except
sickness
and
accident,
it
is
over
the
years,
it
in
the
contract,
it
is
in
our
form,
we
treat
them
as
illness.
arbitrators
have
regularly,
when
the
issue
has
come
up
and
there
is
no
contract
provision
that
makes
it
different
have
treated
them
the
same
as
any
other
temporary
disability.
they
have
done
it,
we
have
the
cases,
and
have
said
it
sex
discrimination
not
to.
but
a
woman,
as
the
court
in
cheekwood
said,
you
just
take
the
highlight
of
title
vii,
if
you
say
when
a
woman
comes
in
for
a
job,
we
think
you
are
going
to
get
pregnant
one
of
these
days,
therefore,
we
do
not
hire
you.
ms.
ruth
weyand
is
not
this
case,
but
if
you
look
at
it
--
if
it
is
--
if
you
think
honestly,
in
a
many,
many
career
jobs
where
they
say
--
ms.
ruth
weyand
there
are
many
career
jobs
where
you
do
not
hire
them
because
you
ask
them,
as
they
do
in
wet
seal,
in
wet
seal
they
ask
the
women,
do
you
expect
to
have
babies,
are
you
using
birth
control,
the
first
charged
filed
in
wet
seal
raised
the
issue
at
the
outset,
what
are
your
plans
for
a
family?
now,
this
is
what
women
meet
when
they
go
get
a
job.
now,
is
that
employer,
if
he
finds
out
they
plan
to
have
babies
discriminating
against
them
because
they
are
women
or
because
they
are
going
to
be
out
of
work
for
a
short
period
of
time?
this
issue
is
one
that
comes
right
down
in
each
case
when
come
to
it.
now,
if
you
can
--
if
it
is
not
sex
discrimination,
let
us
take
the
woman
who
is
pregnant
in
the
plant.
the
employer
says
we
do
not
think
we
ought
to
have
pregnant
women
in
the
plant.
we
do
not
like
the
way
they
look.
we
think
other
workers
are
worried
about
them.
now,
if
he
can
send
them
home
unless
this
act
protects
him,
unless
that
is
sex
discrimination
under
this
statute
or
tends
to
deprive
them
of
jobs
because
i
think
it
tends
to
deprive
them
of
opportunities,
no
question
in
all
the
administrative
agencies,
all
the
courts.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
subject
of
discrimination
because
of
pregnancy
has
listed
thousands
of
charges
in
the
first
year
of
the
eeoc,
we
had
the
contention
yesterday
it
is
was
sort
of
a
fluke
that
it
got
in
actually.
there
was
no
record
--
vote
in
either
the
house
or
the
senate.
there
is
no
record
that
the
people
who
voted
against
the
act
voted
for
the
amendment.
there
is
no
roll
call
vote
in
either
house
or
senate.
but
the
first
year
of
the
eeoc,
this
annual
report
shows
there
were
three
thousand
charges
of
discrimination
because
of
black,
and
two
thousand
charges
because
of
sex,
and
the
bulk
of
these
charges
revolve
around
pregnancy
and
the
annual
reports
to
congress
have
regularly
reported,
if
a
woman,
she
losses
her
seniority.
now,
if
it
is
not
discrimination
because
of
pregnancy
because
of
the
sex,
they
can
take
seniority
away.
this
is
no
way
to
say
they
take
it
away
because
she
is
pregnant,
that
has
been
the
practice
in
many
plants.
they
send
them
home
which
means
they
have
to
go
out
of
their
jobs,
and
the
studies
show
that
in
getting
a
job
and
your
seniority
is
all
important
in
your
continuous
work
history.
employers
in
this
country
place
nothing
as
much
on
as
someone
comes
in
through
a
recommendation,
have
you
had
a
continuous
work
history?
the
woman,
the
reason
she
has
not
had
a
continuous
work
history
in
this
country
in
many,
many
instances
is
because
there
was
no
protection
against
her
losing
her
job.
she
had
no
right
to
come
back
because
employers
said,
well,
you
were
pregnant
and
we
could
--
we
do
not
have
to,
we
can
discharge
you
when
you
are
pregnant,
we
could
deprive
you
of
seniority.
unless
it
is
sex
discrimination
within
the
statute,
there
does
not
exist
that
protection
and
that
has
been
the
basic
problem
of
women.
women
get
60%
of
the
wages
of
man
in
this
country
today.
ge,
when
it
comes
to
the
cost
here
you
look
at
these
benefits
--
these,
we
have
in
our
brief,
the
average
number
of
days
a
man
was
off
because
of
disability
in
’70
was
forty-eight
days,
women
fifty-one
and
for
his
forty-eight
days,
he
got
a
third,
again
as
much
as
the
women
got,
he
got
around
$600.00
and
she
got
around
$400.00,
the
exact
figures
are
in
here
because
his
wage
rate
is
so
much
higher,
we
have
in
the
record
that
43%
percent
of
the
women
working
for
ge
got
less
than
the
janitor.
now
these
rates
--
ms.
ruth
weyand
no,
these
are
the
disability
claims
that
were
--
ms.
ruth
weyand
well,
the
--
you
do
not
if
they
would
be
the
same
women
or
not,
if
you
average
the
number
of
women.
if
the
findings
of
the
court
below
are
correct
and
that
all
the
evidence,
then
the
average
time
they
are
going
to
be
off
is
six
weeks
that
is
forty-two
days.
ms.
ruth
weyand
it
would
not
be
the
same
ones,
if
you
are
averaging
the
number
off.
now,
you
just
do
not
know
to
what
extent,
women
who
had
forty-two
days
might
also
have
another
day,
you
do
not
know
on
terms
of
frequency
or
so
on.
now
the
figures,
i
remember
i
have
looked
up
the
figures,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
during
the
oral
argument
in
cleveland
versus
la
fleur,
asked
why
did
days
of
respiratory
lose
compare
with
other
lose
and
the
figures
which
are
in
the
record
here
and
which
were
secured
for
the
purpose
of
studying
by
the
agencies,
the
eeoc,
the
women’s
commission,
there
were
1.2
days
lost
in
1968
because
of
respiratory
conditions
while
other
catastrophes,
eight-tenths
of
a
day,
taken
all
the
women
in
labor
force
lost
time
because
of
pregnancy.
so,
when
these
agencies,
eeoc,
begun
considering
how
you
deal
with
this
serious
problem
of
women
being
disrupted,
their
whole
continuity
of
employment,
their
seniority
being
disrupted
by
pregnancy,
they
look
to
see
when
men’s
life
are
disrupted
by
disabilities
is
it
the
same
amount
of
time,
how
comparable
is
it?
and
they
have
found
in
terms
of
what
happens
to
men
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
time
that
it
was
an
entirely
comparable
thing,
except
that
the
consequences
did
not
happen
to
men.
they
are,
the
men
have
four
times
as
many
heart
attacks.
the
recent
studies
which
deal
with
the
difference
of
life-expectancy
with
the
difference
of
disability
shows
that
men
--
the
disparity
between
men
and
women
in
length
of
life
has
been
increasing
because
there
are
books
all
written
on
why
a
women
living
longer
than
men,
and
of
course
here
this
same
program
covers
life
insurance.
now,
to
get
back
to
aiello
this
court
there
was
dealing
with
a
social
welfare
program.
it
was
dealing
with
the
power
of
a
sovereign
state
to
determine
what
kind
of
a
fund
to
setup
and
run,
to
take
care
of
problems
in
its
state,
and
it
held
there
that
it
could
make
a
judgment
--
that
it
could
cover
certain
disabilities
and
not
cover
others.
they
had
by
the
time
the
case
got
here
covered
complications
which
our
record
shows
the
complications
of
pregnancy
are
very
often
due
solely
to
a
pre-existing
diabetes
condition,
thyroid
condition
or
something
and
the
increase
would
be
occur,
the
same
complication
would
occur
when
a
man
gains
weight.
there
is
nothing
about
pregnancy
except
the
weight
gain
that
caused
half
of
the
complications
of
pregnancy
in
those
cases.
the
state
of
california
covered
all
of
those.
it
did
not
cover
normal
childbirth,
which
again
our
medical
evidence
shows
really
is
not
different
as
a
medical
problem.
there
are
medical
procedures
in
connection
with
normal
childbirth
that
parallel.
they
go
to
the
hospital.
they
have
an
episiotomy,
which
involves
surgery.
they
have
stitches
and
so
on.
it
is
really
not
different
from
any
other
disability.
but
in
aiello,
this
court
was
not
concerned
with
an
employment
situation.
we
are
here
concerned
with
an
employment
situation.
we
are
also
concerned
with
the
power
of
an
agency
of
government,
which
has
been
vested
with
the
authority
to
solve
these
various
serious
problems
which
is
facing
the
nation
today
of
the
number
of
women,
of
the
thirty-seven
million
women
i
have
told
you
were
working
in
the
labor
force,
twenty-four
million
of
those
women
worked
from
dire
economic
necessity.
they
have
no
source
of
support
of
over
four-thousand
dollars
from
her
husband
or
anybody
else.
and
the
studies
have
shown
that
these
women
when
they
are
put
out,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
a
case
of
economic
necessity,
cheryl
steam
(ph),
when
ge
put
her
on
mandatory
unpaid
leave,
was
forced
to
go
on
welfare
and
before
she
got
her
welfare
check,
her
electricity
was
cut-off,
she
got
no
oil,
she
was
waiting
for
the
birth
of
a
child
in
an
unheated,
unlighted
house
with
no
refrigeration.
and
this
is
not
an
unusual
situation
in
that
the
figures,
and
i
have
got
them
in
there
in
the
footnote,
forty-four
thousand
unborn
fetuses
received
aid
under
the
afdc
program
in
1973.
and
this
type
of
thing
is
what
happens
to
women
and
they
are
competing
with
men
for
jobs
in
terms
of
what
happens
to
them
during
the
period
there,
they
are
disabled.
if
during
the
period
they
are
disabled,
they
are
not
able
to
maintain
income,
continuity
of
employment.
they
have
to
go
look
for
another
job,
as
in
turner,
she
went
and
got
clerical
jobs
during
unemployment.
in
stromberg-carlson,
cases
i
tried
melse,
and
the
company
said
you
go
on
mandatory
leave
because
we
have
put
you
on
mandatory
leave,
they
nevertheless
certified
her
as
able
for
other
jobs
and
she
went
to
look
for
other
jobs.
if
you
want
to
take
another
job,
if
you
are
an
honest
women,
you
want
to
job,
they
are
going
to
have
to
say,
is
it
going
to
permanent
or
not,
you
change
jobs?
the
problem
of
what
happens
to
women,
and
85%
of
the
married
women
in
this
country
have
babies,
they
have
two
babies.
they
worked
on
an
average
of
twenty-five
years,
the
six-week
to
reach
babies
are
very
slight
cost
in
the
industry.
here
the
cost
that
ge,
it
has
not
put
any
figures,
but
you
can
take
the
figures
we
have
here
on,
it
is
less
than
$10.00
a
day
for
a
woman
on
the
last
year
you
had
on
disability.
men
was
twelve,
thirteen
because
of
a
higher
pay
rate,
if
you
take
that
that
is
$70.00
a
week,
for
six
weeks
it
is
$420.00.
if
you
take
these
and
multiply
it
by
all
the
women
that
are
pregnant,
and
multiply
it,
it
comes
to
--
for
six-weeks
it
comes
to
million
dollars.
they
have
spent
$200
million
on
their
life
--
on
their
insurance
program
in
1972.
when
we
negotiate
wage
increases,
we
negotiated
ten-cent
wage
increase,
that
for
300,000
employees
is
$3
billion
a
year.
this
is
chicken-feed
compared
to
talk
about
a
million
eleven,
a
million
one-hundred
thousand,
a
million
five-hundred
thousand,
just
chicken-feed.
in
fact,
i
think
the
reason
that
you
have
this
array
of
ten
amicus
briefs
with
all
of
industry
lined
up
here
in
one
side
and
everybody
else
cio
in
the
state
of
new
york
have
--
any
a
national
education,
aciu
our
side,
is
the
industry
is
not
concerned
about
the
chicken-feed
of
paying
this
little
bit.
it
is
concerned
women
ceased
to
be
that
new
cheap
force
of
labor
in
this
country
which
they
save
a
$140
billion
a
year
if
they
were
paid
the
same
rate
as
women.
there
are
thirty-seven
million
women
in
the
labor
force,
they
get
60%
of
the
wages
than
men,
if
you
take
that
thirty-seven
and
take
the
difference
between
the
wage
rates
you
up
the
whole
labor
--
not
that
they
are
in
cheap,
the
lower
paid
jobs,
and
the
men
quite
not
have
something
if
your
dollar
drifts
away,
but
if
they
were
to
make
that
up
there
would
be
a
$140
billion
a
year
more
wages
paid
in
this
country.
and
this
--
this
matter
of
making
women
transient
workers
--
ms.
ruth
weyand
if
it
is
equal,
it
has
to
be
on
the
same
job
--
ms.
ruth
weyand
oh
yes,
there
is
no
question
about
--
ms.
ruth
weyand
that
is
right.
ms.
ruth
weyand
that
is
absolutely
correct.
ms.
ruth
weyand
but
the
women
do
not
go
into
those
jobs
of
great
deal
here,
at
ge.
ge
here
has
--
traditionally
did
not
pay
women
equally.
it
had
a
job
evaluation
system.
when
you
evaluate
a
job
you
put
the
same
number
of
points
on
male
job
and
a
female
job
and
the
book
said,
when
you
pay
two-thirds
of
the
rate
for
the
same
number
of
points
to
women
that
you
pay
for
men,
and
thus
saying
they
had
forty-three
percent
as
jobs,
the
women
get
the
lower
pay
jobs.
i
was
saying
when
i
was
mentioning
before
that
when
i
said
a
hundred
and
forty
billion
more,
of
course
it
would
not
be
the
same
jobs.
the
women
have
gone
--
had
to
go
into
the
lower
paid
jobs
because
the
companies
are
able
to
say
you
do
not
have
a
continuous
work
history.
you
have
been
off
having
a
baby.
you
would
not
have
a
continuous
work
history
probably
in
all
probability
because
you
will
probably
have
a
baby
and
it
will
interrupt
your
work
history.
and
this
is
the
problem
that
the
agencies
has
have
to
deal
with,
and
the
reason
i
see
this
is
a
different
problem
than
aiello
versus
geduldig,
can
the
agency,
which
have
been
vested
with
congress
with
the
power
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
sex
discrimination,
deal
with
pregnancy,
and
treat
is
as
all
the
doctors
say
is
actually
not
different
than
any
other
disability.
in
terms
of
medical
terms,
it
is
no
different
than
an
epidectomy.
it
is
like
a
caesarian
operation,
very
like
a
gallbladder,
the
men
have
it
and
the
women
has
one
this
one
there
should
be
no
difference,
here
are
the
medical
evidence
from
the
distinguished
doctors
in
this
record
and
their
findings,
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
making
a
difference
in
terms
of
employment,
in
terms
of
disability.
ge’s
plan
purports
to
protect
you
to
income
during
disability.
these
are
the
plans
purport
to
protect
you
for
income
during
disability.
there
is
no,
the
finding
of
both
the
courts
below
is
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
making
a
difference.
they
have
found
that
pregnancy
discriminations
are
unique
characteristic
of
women
and
to
discriminate
because
of
it
is
a
discrimination
because
of
sex.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
ruth
weyand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
which
has
been
raised
as
to
the
relationship
of
collective
bargaining
to
the
issue
of
inclusion
or
exclusion.
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
law,
has
recognized
in
cases
involving
a
collective
bargaining
agreements,
which
discriminate
because
of
race
as
far
way
before
the
enactment
of
title
vii
that
in
steele
v.
louisville
&
nashville
that
union
sometime
do
under
in
discriminatory
contracts
and
if
they
violate
their
constitutional
duty
when
they
do
so.
more
recently
under
title
vii,
title
vii
is
directed
at
the
fact
that
both
of
them
regards
to
race
and
sex.
many
unions
have
not
and
dealing
with
employers
acted
in
a
nondiscriminatory
matter
and
the
existence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
no
excuse.
furthermore
as
the
record
here
shows,
since
the
time
that
fringe
benefits
became
by
law
a
bargaining
subject
with
the
inman
(ph)
v.
nlrb
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
1948
with
affirmed
on
another
point
here.
next
bargaining
session,
the
first
one
with
the
iue
between
ge
and
the
iue
was
in
1950,
the
record
here
shows
with
that
dispute
at
1950,
the
union
point
it
out,
the
general
motors
paid
six
weeks
which
is
usually
enough
to
take
care
of
it
in
fact
with
changing
medical
practices,
many
other
women
get
back
in
less
time,
we
have
two
first
witness
in
our
case.
from
tyler,
texas

certified
back
in
four
weeks,
ge
would
not
take

went
back
in
four
weeks,
another
witness
here
six
weeks
and
my
estimation
on
cost
is
not
the
companies
that
now
pay
six
weeks
if
they
begin
letting
employees
comeback
when
they
are
physically
certified
back,
they
are
going
to
have
a
reduction
in
cost
not
the
increase
in
cost.
but
the
iue
went
to
the
employer.
1950,
1955,
1960,
1963,
1966
repeatedly
and
asked
if
they
bargain
and
included
the
six
weeks
benefit
which
is
traditional,
which
is
present
in
40%
of
the
industry
in
fact
daily
the
companies
actuary,
i
think
is
that
a
60%
of
the
industry
pay
six
weeks
benefits.
ms.
ruth
weyand
no,
i
do
not,
we
have
cases,
i
have
pending
case
against
ge,
i
just
want
to
say
cost
wise.
ms.
ruth
weyand
they
would
not
because,
we
think
that
the
individual
who
has
a
complication,
she
really
has
a
disease,
no
question
illness,
she
needs
the
more
and
that
it
is
discriminatory
to
limit
this
one
area,
the
six
weeks
no
question
about
it
but
i
was
just
saying
in
terms
of
the
union’s
effort
here
over
the
years
to
get
something
for
these
women,
and
they
union
has
wanted
to
spend,
the
union
of
course
in
the
last
rounds
of
negotiations
is
asked
that
it
be
treated
the
exactly
the
same
you
have
record
here
that
there
be
no
limit
whatsoever
that
it,
not
only
go
on
for
26
weeks,
but
it
go
on
under
the
permanent.
we
have
the
iue
is
a
plaintiff
has
suit
against
general
motors
involving
the
six
weeks
time
which
i
mention
is
in
has
file
and
had
finding
to
that
is
discriminatory.
but
i
just
wanted
to
say
if
the
union
has
tried
to
get
this
and
there
is
an
assumption
that
it
seems
to
be
employed
in
some
peoples
minds
that
the
union
asks
for
something
like
this,
the
company
is
going
to
willing
to
give
it
and
that
this
demands
was
on
the
bargaining
table
during
the
long
strike.
there
are
certain
things
companies
have
principles
about,
ge
had
a
principal
about
job
posting
for
years
and
years,
it
has
recently
changed
because
of
title
vii
they
brought
a
new
plant
had
a
job
posting
agreement,
we
had
a
15
week
strike
when
they
took
it
out
that
plant.
ge
has
a
principle
about
not
paying
sickness
and
acts
and
benefits,
now
it
pays
for
everything
and
i
am
afraid
the
record,
the
answer
to
the
question
may
not
have
made
it
clear
it
pays
for
the
time
that
a
man
is
disable
by
cosmetic
surgery.
mr.
kammholz
was
nearly
making
the
point;
they
do
not
pay
the
medical
expense
so
any.
there
is
not
a
single
thing
that
a
man
gets
disabled
by
that
ge
does
not
cover
fully,
but
ge
and
it
appears
in
this
record
with
the
testimony
and
the
testimony
insurance,
it
is
firmly
other
view
that
when
you
pay
disability
benefits
for
pregnancy,
you
are
not
paying
for
the
period
a
woman
is
disabled,
its
figures
are
not
based
on
the
period
it
is
disable,
this
court
upset
a
statute
that
has
a
six
weeks,
the
turner
versus
utah,
it
had
a
six
weeks
returns
date
as
against.
we
all
know
the
people
are
able
to
comeback
earlier
then
that
and
the
cleveland
versus
lafleur,
you
are
agreed
they
can
back
in.
ms.
ruth
weyand
government,
but
you
took
judicial
notice
to
the
fact
that
many
women
are
not
physically
disabled
for
six
weeks
and
ge
has
never
pretended
here,
there
are
doctor,
the
medical
testimony,
there
doctor,
dr.
hellegers,
dr.
forest,
no
dispute,
that
most
women,
in
fact
the
numerical
majority
come
out
the
hospital
in
two
or
three
days
now
and
within
two
weeks
their
doctor,
dr.
wilbury
(ph)
said
11
days
for,
in
terms
of
tired
time
or
the
time
she
went
to
labour
until
she
was
back
on
the
job.
testimony
of
both
their
doctor
--
now
two
weeks
today
is
the
majority
of
women
are
back
at
home
doing
their
homework,
taking
care
of
the
children
which
is
harder
work
from
job
in
the
office.
that
the
medical
position
has
changed
and
i
have
cited
the
point
but
the
reason
there
actuary
when
he
figures
this
billion,
he
figures
that
every
women
under
a
13
week
plan
is
going
to
be
out
13
weeks.
every
women
under
26
week
plan
is
going
to
be
out
23
weeks,
every
women
under
a
52
weeks
is
going
to
be
out
30
weeks
and
he
says
why
not
because
they
are
disable,
they
have
a
never
made
a
pretenses
because
of
disable
because
women
malinger,
they
are
there
--
and
you
will
find
in
the
finding
here,
that
court
found
they
do
not
malinger
but
their
actuary
explain
insurance
position
of
why
this
is
it
not
covered
by
insurance,
is
that
women
have
a
natural
desire
to
take
it
easy.
they
may
have
heard
to
someone
had
a
miscarriage
and
therefore
they
are
going
to
want
to
sit
at
home
and
they
have
a
natural
desire
after
the
child
is
born
to
stay
home
with
it.
now
if
you
knew
these
women,
that
have
to
have
that
paycheck,
they
do
not
want
to
sit
home,
they
want
a
babysitter
their
who
establishes
the
routine
the
day
they
come
back
and
they
want
that
check
to
pay
it
because
it
got
it
get
back.
there
are
37
million
women
working
in
the
united
states
today
and
it
is
the
figures,
department
of
labor
as
of
april,
the
last
figures
came
out
in
july
of
1976
for
the
quarter
ending
april
1975,
21
million
women
either
were
single,
divorced,
widowed
or
had
husband
who
made
less
than
$7000.
also
one
out
of
ten
babies
is
born
to
a
women
who
is
single,
divorced
or
widow.
one
out
of
ten
babies,
this
is
a
the
largest
poor
group
in
this
country
are
the
women,
the
figures
in
here
with
imple
justice.
these
women,
this
matter
of
sheryl
stein
(ph)
here,
when
she
did
not
have
her
check,
had
go
on
welfare,
her
light,
or
heat
was
turned
up.
one
of
the
plaintiff
you
testify
without
dispute,
she
lived
in
a
country
area,
she
had
to
walk
two
miles
with
a
two-year-old
daughter,
her
husband
had
left
her
to
get
food
because
she
got
on
welfare,
she
waited
the
birth
of
a
child
to
unlighted,
un-eated
health
and
ge
is
a
stereotype.
well
they
did
not
think
anything
what
happened,
the
record
showed
she
was
a
married
women,
in
their
view
she
has
a
husband
who
is
going
to
take
care
of
it.
the
testimony
here
on
the
amount
of
time
that
women
are
going
to
be
off
and
why
ge
does
not
pay
this
is
that
women
are
going
to
malinger
and
abuse
it.
their
whole
figure
is
on
the
cost,
now
if
you
take
the
six
weeks
which
sister
mr.
belly
says
that
the
record
that
shows
that
he
said
that
60%
of
the
women
are
covered
for
six
weeks
and
another
one
under
actuary
figured
how
much
it
cost
to
cover
the
women
in
this
country
for
six
weeks.
he
said,
he
deducted
the
amount
of
a
present
cost
based
on
it
and
he
deducted
cost
$225
million
to
cover
60%
of
the
women
for
six
weeks
which
is
what
is
covered.
it
will
only
cost
$150
million
for
every
company
in
united
states
to
make
up
that
other
40%.
if
60%
cost
$225
million
another
40%
is
only
a
$115
million
and
that
is
in
six
week.
the
figures
ge
based
on
and
ges
positions
at
the
bargaining
table
is
that
the
women
want
to
stay
home
and
they
are
going
to
malinger
and
that
has
never
tried
to
count
out.
he
refused
the
figure,
we
asked
for
figures
on
how
many
his
record
are
women
returning,
it
refused
the
find
them,
it
did
not
provide
it,
never
provided
any
figure
on
its
return
rate,
the
number
of
weeks
or
days
that
women
were
out,
it
did
and
i
think
there
was
a
slight
statement,
i
am
sure
mr.
kammholz
did
not
mean
to
state,
that
there
was
a
return
rate
of
40%,
the
return
rate
is
60%
at
ge
on
their
figures
on,
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
record.
ge
and
its
objection
seem
derogatory
why
it
did
not
want
to
provide
me
the
figures
i
wanted
on
the
expense
pregnancy
so
on.
you
know
40%
turnover
rate
for
males
and
females,
40%
turnover
each
year,
now
with
that
turnover
rate,
the
fact
that
40%
of
the
women
can
come
back
is
no
different
then
the
man
may
have
come
back
from
a
injury
or
something,
or
sickness
but
he
is
not
going
to
be
late
before
there
are
anymore
chance
that
he
will
weeks,
months
later
than
these
but
ge
and
many
companies
have
this
position
and
they
get
a
position
that
women
are
going
to
maligner.
now
it
may
be
this
is
because
and
they
have
no
evidence
on
it,
they
(inaudible)
their
actuary
why
when
explains
in
the
whole
insurance
business,
they
do
not
covered
them
in
individual
policies
based
on
the
affected
women
are
going
to
want
to
stay
home
before
and
after
they
are
going
to
maligner,
this
is
an
abuse.
is
they
are
not
subject
to
the
same
controls
but
occurred
in
case
of
a
man
and
man
would
not
stay
out
when
he
is
sick
or
injured
because
he
wants
a
merit
increase,
he
wants
a
promotion,
he
is
going
to
get
back
as
fast
as
he
should,
but
this
does
not
work
with
women.
this
is
straight
sex
stereotyping
right
down
the
line,
the
straight
stereotyping
is
that
we
were
not
concerned
about
sheryl
stein
because
the
record
shows
she
was
married,
it
is
a
stereotype
that
is
contrary
to
the
fact
united
states
has
being
existent
life
today
and
it
goes
much
further
than
merely
pregnancy
because
this
attitude
shakes
the
practices
of
the
companies.
the
payment
of
sickness
enacts
that
benefits
the
american
industry
does
not
serve
as
benefit
welfare
system
entirely,
ge
did
not
put
it
in
with
that
in
mind,
put
it
in
because
this
whole
sickness
actually
says
we
get
productivity,
people
are
not
going
to
worry
about
what
is
going
to
happen
to
them
in
the
future.
this
is
part
of
compensation,
it
says
and
it
uses
this
as
a
control
lever
on
when
a
person
goes
out
and
when
they
comeback,
60%
of
their
wages
a
man,
a
women
who
have
their
budget
geared
and
these
are
not
high
pay,
they
are
the
figures
of
the
time
here,
we
got
the
figures
here
on
the
hourly
rate
it
was
6000
a
year
for
a
women,
7000
or
8000
for
a
man
on
the
average.
now,
a
lot
of
them
get
less
than
even
females
marry
to
ge
males,
you
have
trouble
raising
your
family
and
making
a
budget
on
these
kind
of
figures
today.
they
work
just
a
last
minute
until
the
drop
the
men
that
even
have
a
sang,
because
they
got
it,
they
do
not
want
a
60%,
they
want
a
100%
and
they
get
back
as
soon
as
they
can
and
supervisor
does
not
want
to
put
them
out
if
they
can
find
anything
else
for
them
to
do.
the
chairman
of
our
ge
board
broke
an
arm
and
i
was
asking
about,
do
they
put
people
on
light
work
oh,
yes
i
was
tool
and
die
maker
they
did
not
say
send
me
home
on
sickness
and
they
had
me
answering
a
phone,
they
find
late
light
work
from,
they
have
not
found
light
work
for
women,
they
send
them
home
without
any
pay,
there
is
not
to
disincentive
to
the
management
to
send
a
person
home
if
they
have
to
pay
sickness
and
accidents
benefits.
they
want
to
send
women
home
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
show.
the
court
below
i
must
say,
it
is
said
the
title
vii
intended
that
employment
relations
be
sexblind
as
well
as
colorblind
and
while
there
has
been
remarks
about
how
sex
got
into
the
title
vii,
here
in
1972
when
congress,
for
the
first
time,
provided
enforcement
powers
it
said
that
sex
discrimination
is
of
the
same
concern
as
race
discrimination
and
the
courts
have
agreed
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
two.
i
have
a
promise
to
say
so
i
will
divide
my
time
with
the
assistant
attorney
general.
i
do
want
to
ask
leave
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
because
friday,
i
was
served
with
the
reply
brief
which
very,
very
seriously
mistakes
the
record
in
a
number
of
respects
and
i
do
not
have
time
at
the
oral
argument
to
answre
them
i
will
go
of
course
limited
to
just
put
incorrect
to
the
record
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court
i
would
like
to
ask
leave.
ms.
ruth
weyand
thank
you.
ms.
ruth
weyand
i
am
very
much
regret
that
but
that’s
going
to
be
limited
to
answering
inaccurate
facts
which
was
stated
in
the
reply
brief
which
i
do
think
this
court
should
be
put
straight
on
several
inaccuracy.
i
regret
the
length
of
the
brief--
ms.
ruth
weyand
oh
no,
it
will
be
5
to
10
pages,
i
can
assure
you.
it
is
just
going
to
answer,
but
straight
and
accurate
facts
i
don’t
again
to
re
brief
another.
ms.
ruth
weyand
i
regret
that
you
have
not
found
the
brief
helpful.
the
problem
is
that
if
i
may
make
a
little
bit
of
an
excuse
that
this
is
the
first
case
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
anything
like
this
aspect
of
title
vii.
it
was
a
case
of
first
impression
in
the
lower
courts.
after
we
develop
the
law
you
can
focus.
now,
the
points
which
i
have
not
dealt
with
here
that
are
very
important
but
because
it
is
new,
we
have
not
focused.
we
have
four
courts
of
appeals
now
gone
our
way
and
18
district
judges
but
each
one
of
them
emphasized
what’s
that
completely
different.
now,
the
courts
below,
here
the
finding
of
the
eeoc
was
that
there
is
an
impact,
the
eeoc
finding
set
out
in
the
back
of
the
petition
for
certiorari;
there
is
an
impact
on
this
class
because
of
the
nine
in
coverage.
the
court
of
appeals
here
emphasized
all
women
as
a
class;
lose
compensation
because
they
would
have
to
buy
their
own
as
a
class.
they
did
not
focus
on
an
individual
woman
who
was
pregnant.
they
said
all
women
were
denied
compensation,
and
two
or
three
of
the
other
courts
posted
(inaudible)
on
all
women
denied
compensation.
that
at
first
looks
at
the
irrelevance
of
the
difference
between
the
disabilities
they
pay
for
and
the
ones
they
don’t.
uniformly,
the
courts
have
held
that
cost
is
completely
irrelevant
and
we
think
it
is
here.
i
am
sorry.
