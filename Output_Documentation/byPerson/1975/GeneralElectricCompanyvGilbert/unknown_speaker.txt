unknown
speaker
the
maternity
benefits,
do
you
equate
maternity
benefits
with
pregnancy
disability?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
maternity
benefits
and
pregnancy
disability
payments
under
disability
insurance
policy
are
synonymous?
unknown
speaker
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammholz,
are
there
other
disabilities
for
which
your
experience
indicates
that
at
least
40
or
more
percentile
do
not
return
after
they
acquire
the
disability?
unknown
speaker
none
like
heart
attacks
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
has
this
plan
been
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
over
the
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
has
the
plan
been
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining
negotiating
in
the
bargaining
itself?
unknown
speaker
and
has
the
plan
been
amended
at
all
over
the
years
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining
contracts.
unknown
speaker
not
during
the
last
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammholz,
did
you
deal
with
the
problem
of
return
by
conditioning
the
availability
of
benefits
on
actual
return
for
a
specific
period
of
time
or
something
like
that?
i
am
a
little
puzzled
as
to
where
your
argument
fits
in
to
the
statutory
scheme.
i
do
not
see
how
it
shows
it,
it
is
either
nondiscriminatory
or
whether
it
is
an
affirmative
defense
within
the
–
contemplated
by
the
statutes.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
take
the
same
position
that
the
counsel
in
the
prior
case
did
that
there
is
no
discrimination
unless
it
is
a
pretext?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
would
not
violate
the
statute
if
you
said
in
words,
we
would
rather
pay
the
female
employees
somewhat
less,
does
that
avoid
a
violation
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
or
just
–
they
will
have
lesser
benefits
for
female.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you
say
that
under
the
existing
system
with
the
present
pregnancy
exception,
this
plan
which
is
totally
financed
by
the
company
as
i
understand
it—
unknown
speaker
noncontributory?mr.
unknown
speaker
under
this
plan,
the
company
and
it
is
self-insured,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
under
the
existing
plan
with
the
present
exemptions
that
women
as
a
class
gets
substantially
higher
percentage
of
the
total
benefits
than
do
men
as
a
class
within
a
party?
unknown
speaker
what
were
the
percentages?
unknown
speaker
170,
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
70%
more
than
the
male--
unknown
speaker
as
of
the
--
of
the
male
members
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
would
you
not,
that
congress
did
intend
to
impose
some
cost
on
industry
in
order
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
because
you
say
this
is
not
a
sex
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
earlier
you
were
asked
whether
this
particular
plan
had
been
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
and
my
question
is,
i
think
you
said
it
had
been?
unknown
speaker
did
those
negotiations
ever
result
in
the
incorporation
of
any
provision
respecting
this
pregnancy
disability
plan
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect?
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
this
case?
unknown
speaker
not
in
that
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
understand
the
unlimited
coverage
for
pregnancy
disability
to
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
not
unlimited,
that’s
limited
to
26
weeks.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammholz,
let
me
be
sure
about
this?
the
insurance
industry
then
excludes
all
pregnancy
related
disabilities,
even
those
that
are
complication
of
normal
pregnancy,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
medical
condition
that
is
generally
eliminated?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
coverage
under
ge
policy
for
cosmetic
surgery.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammholz.
unknown
speaker
would
there
by
any
impediment
that
you
can
suggest
to
having
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
parties,
general
electric
and
its
bargaining
agents
provide
for
all
these
things
explicitly
another
which
are
giving
the
respondents
everything
seeking
in
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammholz,
does
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
entire
workforce
have
a
position
on
how
this
money
should
be
distributed?
unknown
speaker
haven’t
they
have
made
a
demand
that
these
benefits
be
included?
unknown
speaker
well
is
not
that
the
position
of
a
union?
unknown
speaker
aren't
they
the
one
who
are
most
directly
interested
in
the
proper
allocation
throughout
the
workforce.
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
me
the
argument
you
are
making
was
that
what
you
are
doing
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
workforce
as
a
whole
but…
unknown
speaker
but
the
union
takes
the
contrary
position.
unknown
speaker
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provided
for
larger
contributions
from
women
employees
based
on
actuarial
studies,
would
that
violate
any
federal
statute
or
eeo
regulation
that
you
know.
in
other
words
it
supposed
to
the
effort
was
to
make
the
people
who
are
benefited
bare
the
cost.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammholz,
you
have
not
mentioned
an
innovating
decisions
since
you
last
argued
here,
washington
against
davis.
unknown
speaker
i
wanted
what
you
have
to
say
about
that.
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
treats
race
satisfies
the
same.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
am
talking
about
this
as
a
statutory
case
has
been.
unknown
speaker
but
that
really
does
not
have
much
do
with
this
statutory.
unknown
speaker
gentlemen
before
you
sit
down
let
me
ask
you
to
help
me
a
little
bit.
could
a
plan
such
as
ges
exclude
generally
sickle
cell
anemia?
unknown
speaker
could
it
exclude
such
a
disease
as
pemphigus,
which
as
i
understand
that
is
more
observant
among
jewish
people
and
others.
unknown
speaker
could
it
exclude
circumcision?
unknown
speaker
it
put
that
in
a
same
category
as
pregnancy.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kammholz,
i
did
not
hear
the
answer,
could
you
telling,
what
was
you
answer
with
respect
to
sickle
cell
anemia.
you
said
it
was
a
disease
that
can
only
be
separate
by
blacks.
unknown
speaker
but
therefore
it
could
be
excluded
or
could
it
not…
unknown
speaker
could
not
be
excluded.
but
why
do
you
have
come
to
different
conclusion
on
pregnancy
which
can
only
be
separated
by…
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
statute
draw
different
mean
sex
discrimination
and
race
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
in
statutory
cases
sex
to
be
a
suspect
classification.
but
those
are
constitutional
cases,
under
the
statute
it
is…
unknown
speaker
so
is
it,
one
is
an
illness,
the
other
is
not.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
told
us.
unknown
speaker
one
last
question,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
your
definition?
unknown
speaker
very
well
mr.
kammholz.
ms.
weyand.
unknown
speaker
ms.
weyand,
would
you
consider
that
a
six
week
benefit
would
comply
with
the
statute
if
all
other
illnesses
had
a
benefited
up
to
26
weeks.
unknown
speaker
they
would
not
have
solved
their
problems.
unknown
speaker
but
that
allow
them
government.
unknown
speaker
you
may
respond
to
the
reply
brief.
unknown
speaker
ms.
weyand,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
you
are
asking
to
file
another
brief;
you
have
already
filed
two,
haven’t
you?
250
pages
total,
do
you
expect
that
we
can
absorb
the
energy
that
you
like
us
to?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
file
another
100
pages?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question
then.
our
rule
as
the
brief
says
a
concise
statement
of
the
case
yet
you
have
61
pages
of
fax.
unknown
speaker
very
well
ms.
weyand.
mr.
attorney
general.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pottinger,
do
you
interpret
our
rule
to
permit
in
a
case
like
this
that
government
would
argue
amicus
without
an
order
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
if
--
is
that
the
government’s
interpretation
of
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
now
that’s
covered
for
women
too.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
in
light
of
the
geduldig
case?
i
never
knew
how
to
pronounce
the
respondent
aiello?
unknown
speaker
not
alone
footnote
20;
the
whole
judgment
and
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
what
actuarial
elements
of
important
factor
in
that
holding?
unknown
speaker
that
case
held
that
the
pregnancy
exclusion
was
not
on
sex
discriminations.
now
that’s
what
this
statute
forbids,
it
is
sex
discrimination.
aiello
said
it
that
was
not
one,
now
what’s
it--
unknown
speaker
well
griggs
was
talking
about
testing;
it
was
not
talking
about
this
type
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
the
holding
of
griggs
dealt
with
testing.
unknown
speaker
when
you
properly
cited
then
you
mean
that
it’s
proper
to
cite
a
case
for
something
other
than
its
holding?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
a
holding
then.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
about
impact
or
effect
in
the
statute,
is
it
there?
unknown
speaker
the
only
place
that
appears
is
a
gloss
that’s
put
on
the
statute
or
the
way
the
statute
is
construed
by
the
eeoc
and
by
this
court
in
griggs.
unknown
speaker
is
the
eeoc
authorized
to
issue
regulation?
unknown
speaker
and
not
just
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
when
you
said
men
cost
more,
did
you
mean
in
the
life
insurance
program
as
oppose
to
medical?
unknown
speaker
but
your
basic
position
is
that
the
cost
really
doesn’t
make
any
difference
anyway?
unknown
speaker
when
would
cost
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
a
matter
of
bankrupting
the
company
and
if
a
business
necessity
defenses
interposed.
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
statutory
basis
for
business
necessity
defense?
unknown
speaker
how
(voice
overlap)
you
think
those
alternative
proposals
are
in
the
face
of
the
realities
of
collective
bargaining?
if
there’s
going
to
be
any
reduction
in
the
benefits?
unknown
speaker
it
can’t.
i
am
talking
about
the
realities
of
collective
bargaining
--
do
you
think
union
is
going
to
agree
to
reduction
in
the
benefits
that
you
already
have?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
mr.
kammholz.
unknown
speaker
the
conditions
that
are
more
seen
more
frequently
on
one
sex
than
another...
unknown
speaker
it
sum
to
80
or
90%
to
10%,
20%
ratio.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
