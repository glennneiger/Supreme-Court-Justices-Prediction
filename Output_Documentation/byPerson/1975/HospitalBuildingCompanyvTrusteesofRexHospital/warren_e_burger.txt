we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning,
a
number
74-1452,
hospital
building
company
against
the
trustees
of
rex
hospital.
mr.
train,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
do
understood
fully
what
you
have
in
mind
when
you
said
that
one
of
the
patient
goes
to
a
hospital,
the
dominant,
i
think
was
the
word
you
used,
that
dominant
relationship
is
a
personal
one
with
doctors
and
nurses.
now
when
a
person
consults
and
therefore
these
other
peripheral
matters
such
as
bandages,
sheets
and
bill
of
cases
are
presumably
not
pretty
very
relevant.
now,
when
a
person
goes
to
a
lawyer
is
the
relationship
between
the
client
and
the
lawyer
less
a
personal
relationship
than
with
the
doctor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
usually
involve
financing,
that
was
the
link
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
dominant
relationship
in
parallel
that
you
were
making
or
that
i
am
making,
the
dominant
relationship
is
still
a
very
personal
one
between
a
client
and
lawyer
to
whether
he
is
dealing
with
title
search,
whether
without
the
connection
with
financing
of
the
purchase.
i
am
just
a
little
puzzled
why
you
put
some
of
some
emphasis
on
personal
relationship
aspect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
these
cases
are
not
from
afar,
and
perhaps
even
below
increases
in
lot
of
other
areas
i
am
not
sure
how
important
it
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
ambiguously
he
did
not
indicate
whether
he
thought
the
findings
of
fact
were
erroneous
or
whether
he
thought
the
evaluation
of
the
legal
aspects
were
erroneous.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-1452
hospital
building
company
against
the
trustees
of
rex
hospital
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
