unknown
speaker
but
it
still
compares
to
small
hospital?
unknown
speaker
you
say,
tripling
the
number
of
beds.
if
it
had
2,
it
would
want
6,
that
is
still
triple,
would
that
be
tripling?
unknown
speaker
mr.
train,
let
me
ask
you,
perhaps
the
record
clearly
discloses
this.
your
client
is
a
profit
hospital,
for
profit
hospital?
unknown
speaker
is
it
owned
by
a
group
of
physicians
at
all?
unknown
speaker
is
this
restricted
to
specified
physicians?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
speaking
of
the
three
hospitals
competing
and
then
usually
a
profit
hospital
is
restricted
in
its
admission
policies
to
patients
of
those
physicians
who
own
it.
unknown
speaker
whether
your
complaint
shows
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
train,
somewhere
you
comment
on
the
oregon
medical
society
cases
as
you
go
along--
unknown
speaker
we
have
changed
since
25
years
--
since
that
case
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
justice
jackson
wrote
the
oregon
medical
society
a
decision
too,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you
not
say
in
the
oregon
medical
society
case
if
you
are
right
that
although
admittedly
they
were
not
many
interstate
context,
there
were
some
and
if
interstate
commerce
feels
the
effect,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
if
the
conspiracy
charged
is
local?
unknown
speaker
mr.
train,
for
pure
curiosity;
are
there
many
fore
profit
hospitals
in
the
southeast?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
are
they
increasing
in
number
or
decreasing?
unknown
speaker
i
was
wondering
whether
you,
you
think
in
view
of
the
arguments
you
make
that
the
sherman
act
has
substantially
the
same
coverage
with
respect
to
in
commerce
and
effect
on
commerce
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
has.
or
putting
it
differently,
can
you
think
of
any
business,
any
local
business
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
sherman
act
on
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
try
to
think
of
one
fair
labor
standards
act,
window
washers
of
an
office
building
are
for
example.
unknown
speaker
they
are.
they
have
been
so
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
they
would
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
a
small
town
with
three
restaurants
in
it
and
two
of
them
decided
they
were
going
to
fix
prices
to
put
them
out
of
business,
they
would
clearly
be
covered--
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
the
restaurants
in
question,
instead
of
purchasing
$112,000.00
in
interstate
commerce,
purchased
$12,000.00.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
and
upon
how
large
percentage
the
$12,000.00
was
of
the
restaurants
total
purchases?
unknown
speaker
not
only
--
no
bright
land
but
no
land
at
all.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
know
there
is
provision
on
the
robinson
patman
act
that
exempts
hospital
or
at
least
has
a
different
provision
with
respect
to
the
purchase
of
products
by
not
for
profit
hospitals.
does
it
not
necessarily
imply
that
the
hospital
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
when
the
purchases
drugs
at
a
lower
price
than
perhaps
a
wholesaler
pays?
unknown
speaker
i
realize
that
but
i
am
suggesting
congress
in
enacting
that
must
have
made
some
assumption
with
respect
to
the
transactions
engaged
in
that
hospital.
unknown
speaker
the
only
one
the
drugs
come
from
out-of-state
but
--
unknown
speaker
there
must
be
an
out
of
state
conspirator
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
to
have
an
out
of
state
conspirator.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bolze,
is
not
that
difference
between
the
oregon
medical
case
in
this,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
finding
of
no
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
whereas
here
we
have
a
complaint
with
no
trial
yet
being
held
and
there
is
an
allegation
of
an
adverse
effect
namely
that
there
would
be
a
lesser
flow
of
goods
and
there
would
be
if
the
hospitals
were
permitted
to
expand.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
i
just
go
in
to
the
question
of
whether
oregon
medical
controls.
there
you
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
found
and
decided
by
the
supreme
court
not
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
no
adverse
effect.
here
you
have
an
allegation
of
adverse
effect,
so
are
not
the
cases
different.
unknown
speaker
the
allegation
that
must
be
taking
as
true
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
different,
are
you
saying
that
adverse
effect
is
not
sufficient.
i
am
just
directing
my
question
to
the
point
that
oregon
medical
does
not
really
disposed
at
this
case.
we
have
question
that
whether
these
allegation
are
sufficient
i
understand
your
argument
here.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
it
was
not
sufficient
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
according
to
the
findings
of
any
adverse
effect
at
all.
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
any
difference
if
the
payment
were
made
by
travelers
on
the
rolling?
unknown
speaker
why
you
are
putting
an
emphasis
on
bluecross
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
that
some
of
us
said
in
this
solicitor
general's
brief
is
just
factually
inaccurate?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
the
madison's
view
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
butler
against
the
united
states
in
favor
of
hamilton's
view
i
think
was
not
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
this
general
welfare
clause
is
limited
to
the
areas
in
which
congress
had
an
independent
source
of
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
give
them
the
power
to
spend
for
any
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
specifically
limited
--
unknown
speaker
we
go
back
again
to
this
business
of
medicare
payments.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
complaint
alleges
that
a
substantial
number
of
persons
hospitalized
in
nevada
area
come
from
outside
the
state.
if
then
they
get
their
medicare
payments
to
north
carolina
bluecross,
is
there
any
aspect
of
interstate
commerce
with
respect
to
those
patients?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
argument
but
it
is
still
in
the
complaint,
is
it
not?
i
read
a
substantial
number
of
persons
coming
to
the
raleigh
area
for
treatment
of
the
medical
of
surgical
hospital
there,
reside
in
the
states
other
than
the
state
of
north
carolina.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
dollar
amount
is
irrelevant.
i
wonder
what
your
view
is
on
third
circuit
case
involving
the
philadelphia
hospitals
which
i
recall
involve
the
curtailment
of
the
number
of
hospitals
in
the
market.
would
you
say
that
their
case
was
correctly
decided?
if
so
how
do
you
reconcile
that
would
with
the
argument
you
just
made?
unknown
speaker
there
are
two
differences,
one
there
are
more
hospitals
and
two,
you
close
down
instead
of
preventing
expansion?
unknown
speaker
if
were
in
one
state,
you
would
say
the
case
would
have
been
decided
differently?
unknown
speaker
then
you
do
not
rely
on
two
state
points.
the
points
you
rely
on
are,
one
the
difference
in
the
number
of
the
hospitals
and
two
the
difference
between
expansion
and
curtailment?
unknown
speaker
you
know
100
hundred
hospital,
what
effect
on
interstate
commerce
is
relevant,
other
than
purchases
of
supply
across
state
line?
unknown
speaker
the
difference
is
entirely
in
the
dollar
value
of
the
two
situations?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
competition
in
the
providing
of
hospital
services
--
unknown
speaker
rather
the
completion
in
selling
goods
and
services
to
hospital?
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
is
a
deminimous
effect
here,
and
there
is
a
significant
there.
that
is
your
difference?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
theory.
the
differences
between
the
substantial
effect
there
and
the
deminimous
effect
here.
you
do
not
contend
no
effect
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
only
effect
in
other
cases
is
an
effect
on
flow
of
goods.
that
it
seems
to
me
you
have
acknowledged
that,
if
that
effect
is
substantial
than
the
sherman
act
jurisdiction
and
the
difference,
as
i
understand
you
is
that
here
you
are
contending
the
effect
is
deminimous.
where
is
there
something
i
am
missing?
unknown
speaker
we
is
this
your
position
again?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
critical
that
there
were
two
state
involve
there.
i
do
not
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
either
it
is
critical
or
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
your
reference
to
justice
black
i
think
he
dissented
in
the
oregon
medical
case.
unknown
speaker
can
we
read
justice
black's
opinion
in
the
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
the
oregon
case
in
full
in
two
lines.
mr.
justice
black
is
of
the
opinion
of
the
judgment
below
is
clearly
erroneous.
the
judgment
below
is
clearly
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
