what
was
the
basis
of
congress'
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction
to
adopt
this
pervasive
regulation
of
the
delivery
of
hospital
services?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talked
about
pervasive
regulation
of
the
health
care,
are
you
relying
primarily
on
the
social
security
act
provisions
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
does
not
depend
on
the
commerce
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
asking
you
a
moment
ago
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
of
those
depend
on
the
commerce
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
with
respect
to
drugs,
is
it
not
more
or
less
of
a
kind
of
continuous
flow
which
would
distinguish
it
from
the
initial
purchase
of
a
bed
and
then
replacing
it
15
years
later
or
replacing
a
chair
in
the
same
way.
