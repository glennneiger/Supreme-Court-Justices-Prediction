mr.
john
k.
train
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
of
law
presented
here
in
this
case
is
whether
a
conspiracy
between
two
business
competitors
to
take
over
and
dominate
a
market
to
the
exclusion
of
the
third
competitor
is
actionable
under
the
sherman
act.
specifically,
whether
the
traditional
interstate
commerce
test
for
sherman
act
jurisdiction
are
met
by
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
business
in
question
is
the
delivery
of
hospital
services.
the
geographical
market
in
question
is
wake
county,
raleigh,
north
carolina.
petitioner
hospital
building
co.
or
hbc
owns
and
operates
mary
elizabeth
hospital
in
raleigh.
the
named
conspirators
are
essentially
the
two
competing
hospitals
in
raleigh,
rex
hospital
and
wake
hospital,
and
various
persons
associated
with
or
acting
for
them.
the
conspiracy
alleged
is
that
these
two
competitors
and
the
other
conspirators
which
have
been
referred
to
in
our
brief
as
the
raleigh
group
have
conspired
to
allocate
the
market
for
hospital
services
in
terms
of
customers
and
of
output
in
raleigh
to
fix
prices
for
hospital
services
and
to
foreclose
effective
competition
by
hbc
in
that
market.
this,
we
submit
to
the
court
is
no
second
rate
conspiracy
as
the
fourth
circuit
majority
opinion
appeared
to
assume.
in
order
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
conspiracy,
the
raleigh
group
has
undertaken
among
other
actions
to
prevent
expansion
through
relocation
and
construction
of
an
entirely
new
facility
by
hbc
from
an
old
49
bed
hospital
to
a
new
149
bed
hospital,
a
tripling
of
capacity
and
ability
to
compete.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
its
size
in
comparison
with
other
hospitals.
we
have
before
us
only
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
size
of
the
market
is
not
in
the
record,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
before
this
court--
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
that,
i
understand
that
your
honor.
the
basic
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
complaint
alleges
facts
sufficient
to
meet
either
or
both
of
the
two
test
for
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
act.
the
in-commerce
test
and
the
affecting
commerce
test.
the
competition
restrained
by
the
conspiracy
is
real.
hospitals,
whether
government
owned,
nonprofit
or
proprietary
profit
making
such
as
hbc,
compete
to
serve
patients
who
pay
for
treatment
there
or
for
whom
payment
is
made
by
third
parties.
this
is
what
the
complaint
refers
to
as
paid
hospital
business.
such
competition
is
of
the
price
and
price
equivalent
variety
such
as
lower
rates
and
charges,
the
inclusion
of
additional
services
in
basic
rates
and
also
of
the
non
--priced
variety.
more
modern
and
pleasant
facilities,
larger
stance,
more
extensive
and
modern
equipment,
just
as
in
other
businesses,
hospitals
compete
by
offering
better
services
and
facilities,
lower
prices
or
both.
the
provision
of
hospital
services,
the
business
of
operating
a
hospital,
involves
much
more
than
placing
a
bed
in
a
building
and
hiring
a
staff.
the
hospital
business
is
not
just
a
local
business.
hospital
services
cannot
be
provided
by
hbc
or
by
any
hospital
without
a
continuing
and
substantial
flow
of
drugs,
equipment
and
supplies.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
no,
the
record
show
that
it
is
owned
by
chartered
medical
corporation
which
is
a
regional
group
or
chain
if
you
will,
of
hospitals
and
nursing
homes
located
in
macon,
georgia.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
your
honor,
again
i
emphasize,
we
are
dealing
solely
with
the
complaint
since
the
case
was
dismissed
on
a
motion
under
12
(b)
(6).
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that,
i
am
sure
it
has
stay
of
rules
and
regulations
like
so
many
of
them
do.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
your
honor
--
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
your
honor,
physicians
do
not
own
this
hospital.
this
is
owned
by
a
profit
making
corporation.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
patients
who
are
subject
to
admission
to
a
profit
making
hospital
are
necessarily
restricted
to
those
of
the
physicians
who
own
it.
i
believe
and
again
i
am
talking
outside
the
record
because
we
do
not
have
a
record.
but
i
believe
their
limitation
is
that
they
must
be
admitted
by
members
of
a
staff
there
and
i
believe
that
typically
the
staff
is
wider
than
just
those
paid
physicians
who
might
own
it.
in
any
event,
as
i
say,
this
hospital
is
not
owned
by
physicians
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
restrictions
on
admissions
to
this
particular
hospital
or
for
that
matter,
the
other
two
hospitals
insofar
as
this
record
shows.
hospitals,
of
course,
as
we
have
stated
that
do
not
exist
in
vacuum,
they
have
to
purchase
goods
and
supplies
just
like
any
other
business.
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
a
substantial
amount
of
hbc's
purchases
of
these
supplies
are
purchased
from
out-of-state
vendors.
and
further,
that
80%
of
the
supplies
of
hbc
are
purchased
pursuant
to
nationwide
supply
contracts
which
are
negotiated
by
hbc's
out-of-state
parent
corporation,
charter
medical
in
macon,
georgia.
a
hospital,
likewise,
cannot
function
without
management
and
administration.
hbc
purchases
and
receives
management
services
from
its
out-of-state
parent.
hospital
services
cannot
be
furnished
unless
they
are
paid
for
and
today,
that
means
receipts
of
payments
from
third
party
payors,
both
private
insurance
carriers
and
governmental
programs.
almost
95%
of
hbc's
billings
are
to
third
party
payors
and
the
source
of
such
payments
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
is
located
outside
the
state
of
north
carolina.
in
short,
interstate
commerce
is
at
the
heart
of
the
operation
of
any
hospital.
and
in
particular,
is
at
the
heart
of
the
operation
of
mary
elizabeth
by
hbc.
drugs,
supplies,
equipment
and
other
goods
are
purchased
in
the
interstate
commerce
as
ingredients
of
the
ultimate
product,
hospital
services,
which
is
purchased
by
patients,
the
consumers.
in
turn,
bills
are
rendered
to
and
payments
received
from
out-of-state
financial
sources.
hbc
as
the
operator
of
the
hospital
and
the
furnisher
of
hospital
services
is
at
the
center
of,
and
is
an
integral
and
essential
connector
between
these
flows
of
goods
and
payments
in
interstate
commerce.
in
these
circumstances,
we
submit
that
any
conspiracy
to
restrain
competition
by
hbc
in
a
limited
market
where
there
are
only
three
competitors,
hbc
being
one.
in
the
furnishing
of
hospital
services
is
actionable
in
federal
courts
under
both
the
effects
commerce
test
and
the
in
commerce
test
for
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
act.
we
will
discuss
first,
the
effects
commerce
test.
we
respectfully
submit
that
a
conclusion
adverse
to
that
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
compelled
by
this
court's
consistent
application
of
the
effects
commerce
test
to
find
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
act
with
respect
to
so
called
local
conspiracies.
in
such
cases
as
southeastern
underwriters,
women's
sports
wear
and
most
recently
goldfarb,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
designation
of
a
particular
business
as
local
or
intrastate
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
business
or
conspiracy
to
restrain
it
is
subject
to
the
sherman
act.
southeastern
underwriters
in
particular
teaches
us
that
the
distinction
between
what
has
been
called
local
and
what
intrastate
is
a
type
of
mechanical
criterion
which
this
court
has
not
deemed
controlling
in
the
measurement
of
federal
power.
not
withstanding
this
admonition,
the
fourth
circuit
majority
like
the
district
court
in
the
st.
bernard
parish
case
cited
in
our
brief
which
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit
dealing
with
the
same
issue.
the
fourth
circuit
was
mesmerized
by
its
focus
on
the
supposedly
local
nature
of
the
hospital
business.
as
already
noted,
this
characterization
is
a
misconception.
the
essence
of
the
hospital
business
is
the
interstate
flow
to,
through
and
from
it,
of
goods,
bills
and
payments.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
i
would
be
pleased
to
comment
on
that
case
right
now
your
honor
in
the
supreme
court
opinion.
the
reference
is
to
the
few
contacts
with
interstate
commerce
as
consisting
of
payments
made
from
the
oregon
medical
society
association
arrangement
of
the
insurance
for
hospital
payments
from
oregon
to
other
states
where
patients
covered
by
the
oregon
arrangements
had
gone
to
other
states.
the
supreme
court
characterized
those
i
believe
as
fortuitous
and
sporadic,
i
believe
was
another
word
that
the
supreme
court
there
used.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
well,
i
believe,
i
can
state
my
place
that
i
think
they
have,
i
do
not
believe
that
case
is
authority
in
support
of
the
fourth
circuits
opinion
here
since
as
i
say
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
in
commenting
on
the
interstate
commerce
involvement
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
substantial.
there
was
not
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
here,
and
as
opposed
to
sporadic
and
infrequent
payments
across
state
lines,
we
allege
a
continuing
flow
of
such
payments.
i
am
referring
if
your
honor
please,
to
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
that
case
and
not
to
the
district
court
opinion.
the
question
is
not
of
characterization
of
something
as
local
or
intrastate,
the
question
is
whether
interstate
commerce
is
affected.
as
mr.
justice
jackson
said
in
women's
sports
wear,
it
is
interstate
commerce
that
feels
the
pinch,
it
does
not
matter
how
locally
operation
which
applies
the
squeeze.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
he
did
indeed
your
honor
and
as
i
have
just
said,
i
think
that
can
be
squarely
rationalized
with
our
position
here.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
because
our
position
is
not,
your
honor
that
every
conspiracy
or
every
effect
on
interstate
commerce
is
actionable.
i
think
the
cases
have
made
it
clear
that
the
effect
must
be
what
the
case
is
being
substantial.
this
court
has
measured
that
quantitatively,
it
has
measured
it
qualitatively.
in
the
oregon
medical
society
case,
i
think
we
have
a
case
where
according
to
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
jackson,
there
were
just
no
substantial
effects
on
interstate
commerce.
the
fourth
circuit's
majority
opinion,
may
it
please
the
court,
states
the
effect
on
commerce
test,
and
the
words
that
have
been
used
before
by
this
court
and
others.
but
then
it
reads
it
out
of
existence
as
we
see
it
by
engrafting
upon
it
three
additional
conditions
not
previously
deemed
to
be
a
part
of
that
test.
first,
according
to
the
fourth
circuit
majority
opinion,
the
aim
or
object
of
the
conspiracy
whether
it
is
"directed
at"
a
supposedly
local
activity
is
an
element
in
determining
the
substantiality
of
the
effect
on
commerce.
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
act
is
not,
we
submit,
a
function
of
intent,
but
rather
a
function
of
impact.
intent
maybe
relevant
in
a
limited
sense
to
show
the
probable
effect
of
an
act,
but
where
the
effect
is
clear,
intent,
we
submit,
is
not
relevant
to
determine
the
substantiality
of
that
effect
under
the
sherman
act.
in
addition,
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
described
a
conspiracy
directed
not
just
at
hbc,
not
just
at
an
expansion
of
the
hospital
but
at
an
entire
market.
the
goal
of
the
conspirators
being
to
control
and
allocate
all
of
the
paid
hospital
business
in
the
raleigh
area.
this
does
not
just
keep
hbc
from
competing,
we
respectfully
submit,
it
keeps
everyone
from
competing.
it
denies
entry
to
all
potential
interest.
second,
the
fourth
circuit's
majority
opinion,
finds
the
complaint
defective
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
act,
because
there
is
no
showing
that
out
of
state
suppliers
or
payors
will
go
out
of
business.
we
submit
that
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
effect
on
the
flow
of
commerce,
not
whether
there
is
an
effect
on
out
of
state
links
or
originatives
of
that
flow.
in
goldfarb
for
example,
this
court
rejected
the
argument
that
there
was
no
showing
that
purchasers
were
discouraged
and
no
showing
that
somehow
the
out
of
state
lenders
were
affected
anti-competitively
by
the
conspiracy
there
found
to
be
actionable.
finally,
in
seeking
to
verbalize
a
formula
for
application
of
the
sherman
act,
the
fourth
circuit
majority,
engrafted
a
monopoly
power
requirement
on
the
essential
jurisdictional
allegations.
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
of
course,
is
designed
to
reach
restraint
prior
to
the
development
of
monopoly
power.
this
court
has
never
required
the
existence
of
any
competitive
power
sufficient
to
drive
a
competitor
out
of
business
before
finding
the
sherman
act
applicable
or
rather
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
applicable.
section
2
of
course,
deals
with
monopolies.
again
may
it
please
the
court,
even
accepting
the
fourth
circuit
vision
of
the
true
test
here.
the
power
alleged
on
the
part
of
the
conspirators
here,
the
power
to
allocate
the
market
among
themselves,
the
power
to
fix
prices,
and
crucially
the
power
to
exclude
hbc
from
the
market,
represents
precisely
the
danger
congress
sought
to
guard
against
in
its
enactment
of
the
sherman
act.
substantiality
is
a
requirement
which
this
court
has
found
to
be
satisfied
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively.
it
is
certainly
satisfied
quantitatively
if
a
not
insubstantial
amount
of
interstate
commerce
is
affected.
the
quantitative
standard,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
satisfied
in
this
case.
the
conspiracy
here
has
operated
to
restrain
a
tripling
in
size
of
a
business
through
its
relocation
and
reconstruction
in
a
new
facility,
and
perhaps
mr.
justice
blackmun,
this
gets
to
your
question
as
to
the
size
of
the
quantity
of
what
is
involved
here.
in
1972,
this
business
purchased
approximately
$112,000.00
in
supplies
and
equipment
on
a
regular
and
continuing,
not
a
time
basis.
and
a
substantial
amount
of
that
was
purchased
from
out
of
state
sources.
such
purchases,
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint,
would
increase
substantially
after
expansion.
hbc
purchased
$36,000.00
worth
of
management
services
from
its
out
of
state
parent.
that
payment
is
based
on
a
gross
revenues
formula
and
likewise
these
purchases
of
management
services
would
increase
substantially
upon
expansion.
a
substantial
flow
of
capital,
at
least
4
million
dollars,
communications
and
services
in
interstate
commerce
will
result
from
the
relocation
and
the
reconstruction
in
a
new
facility
of
mary
elizabeth.
finally,
revenues
are
received
in
substantial
amounts
by
hbc
from
out
of
state
payment
sources.
more
patients
would
be
served
by
relocated
and
expanded
hospital
and
thus,
more
revenues
received
from
out
of
state
payment
sources.
the
quantitative
effects
on
interstate
commerce
here
are
both
present
and
potential.
but
equally
as
real
in
each
case,
present
effects
lie
in
the
immediate
prevention
of
an
expansion
of
the
flow
of
commerce.
the
goods
and
the
services
which
would
have
been
purchased
by
an
expanded
and
relocated
hbc,
the
capital
and
additional
revenues
which
would
have
flowed
to
hbc
from
out
of
state;
the
potential
effect
is
the
terminal
choking
off
of
all
activity
of
the
conspiracy's
ultimate
goal,
the
exclusion
of
hbc
from
the
market
is
achieved.
perhaps
one
of
the
problems,
we
have
had
in
articulating
the
effect
on
commerce
of
the
conspiracy
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
conspiracy
has
blocked
an
attempt
to
expand,
relocate
and
thus,
trouble
the
capacity
of
hbc.
we
are
therefore
forced
to
talk
about
what
might
have
been
and
we
hope
what
will
be
in
the
future.
in
these
circumstances,
the
fact
that
this
action
unquestionably
falls
within
the
line
for
sherman
act
jurisdiction
that
has
been
drawn
by
this
court
as
best
demonstrated
perhaps
by
turning
the
situation
around.
if
this
case
alleged
the
existence
of
a
149
bed
hospital
and
had
the
defendants
combined
and
conspired
to
eliminate
that
hospital
as
a
competitor
for
hospital
services
in
the
raleigh
area,
and
to
reduce
by
two
thirds,
its
ability
to
do
business,
and
if
the
reduction
in
hbc's
business
resulted
then
in
a
significant
decrease,
a
measurable
decrease,
in
the
flow
of
goods,
supplies,
credit,
reimbursements
and
so
on
from
out
of
state
to
hbc,
then
i
think
the
lower
courts
would
have
had
less
difficulty
in
seeing
that
this
substantially
effects
commerce
test
for
application
of
the
sherman
act
had
been
met.
we
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
there
is
no
functional
or
legal
difference
for
purposes
of
application
of
the
sherman
act
between
a
conspiracy
which
prevents
expansion
and
entry
of
a
business
competitor
and
one
which
results
in
contraction.
therefore,
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
being
both
obvious
and
we
believe
substantial,
the
conspiracy
causing
these
effects
is
actionable
under
the
sherman
act.
the
quantity
or
extent
of
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce
is
not
alone
determinative
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
this
court
has
observed
just
last
term
in
the
goldfarb
case
that
where
there
is
an
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
no
specific
magnitude
of
the
effect
need
be
proven.
as
we
have
discussed,
the
impact
here
is
sufficiently
certain
of
measurement
as
to
satisfy
the
quantitative
requirements
of
the
effects
commerce
test.
in
addition,
the
activities
here
in
question
without
regard
to
the
specific
magnitude
of
interstate
commerce
affected
by
them
have
effects
which
the
congress
surely
must
have
intended
to
prevent
by
enactment
of
the
sherman
act.
the
allegations
of
that
complaint
present
a
picture
of
perhaps
the
classic
restraint
of
trade.
two
competitors
undertake
to
control
and
divide
a
market
to
the
exclusion
of
the
third.
the
third
infused
with
management
and
capital
by
an
out
of
state
source
undertakes
to
become
an
effective
competitor.
by
the
actions
taken
pursuant
to
a
non
competitive
arrangement,
this
initiative
is
thwarted.
in
this
case
we
submit,
what
we
have
is
not
only
the
stifling
of
existing
competition,
the
stifling
of
an
existing
competitor,
but
what
we
have
is
the
denial
of
effective
entry
to
a
new
entrant
into
the
market
through
the
erection
of
artificial
barriers
around
that
market.
in
such
a
case,
purchasers
and
consumers
in
that
market
are
denied
and
deprived
of
the
advantages
of
free
competition
and
the
sherman
act
maybe
invoked
against
the
conspirators.
we
believe
the
jurisdiction
is
also
present
here
under
the
in-
commerce
test.
hbc
operates
in
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce
and
any
competitive
restraints
on
its
activities
thus
impact
directly
on
interstate
commerce.
in
the
american
building
maintenance
industries
decision
in
1975,
this
court
has
stated
that
to
be
in-commerce,
a
corporation
must
itself
be
directly
engaged
in
the
production,
distribution
or
acquisition
of
goods
or
services
in
interstate
commerce.
hbc
as
a
purchaser
of
a
substantial
amount
of
goods
and
services
in
interstate
commerce;
management
services
essential
to
the
functioning
of
hbc
and
of
its
provision
of
hospital
services
come
from
outside
the
state
of
north
carolina.
the
goods
and
management
services
purchased
by
hbc
for
its
operations
which
are
essential
part
of
those
operations
are
purchased
on
a
continuing
and
regularly
recurring
basis.
in
all
cases,
these
goods,
these
services,
purchased
in
interstate
commerce
originating
outside
the
state
of
north
carolina
are
essential
ingredients
of
the
product;
medical,
surgical
hospital
services
which
has
been
purchased
by
the
consumer.
we
have
touched
previously
upon
the
interstate
system
of
payments,
what
we
refer
to
as
the
nationwide
payment
system
which
today
exist
for
the
purchase
of
health
care
in
general
and
hospital
services
in
particular.
in
determining
whether
hbc
as
an
interstate
commerce,
it
is
particularly
appropriate
to
consider
this
developing
nationwide
system.
the
existence,
we
respectfully
submit,
of
a
nationwide
payment
system
establishes
that
those
participating
in
it
are
in
interstate
commerce.
finally,
the
series
of
federal
statutes
which
by
their
own
terms
or
through
decisions
of
this
court
have
specific
application
to
hospitals,
demonstrates
the
strong
federal
interest
in
the
furnishing
of
hospital
services
in
this
country
today.
we
do
not
argue
that
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
act
is
conclusively
presumed
if
the
activities
in
question
are
regulated
under
federal
statutes.
we
do
say
however,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
activities
in
question
are
the
subject
of
other
federal
regulation,
their
supposedly
local
character
is
diminished.
the
pervasive
regulation
of
health
care
services
in
this
country
today
demonstrates
the
major
federal
concern
in
this
area
and
offers
a
strong
indication
that
delivery
of
health
care
services
is
not
solely
a
matter
of
local
concern.
certainly,
the
pervasive
federal
regulation
of
delivery
of
hospital
services
is
inconsistent
with
the
finding
below
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
provision
of
hospital
services
are
a
purely
local
activity.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause
your
honor.
and
as
the
courts
have
pointed
out
when
the
congress
undertakes
to
regulate
pursuant
to
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
it
leaves,
it
has
one
of
two
ways
in
which
to
go
in
which
to
determine
whether
specific
activities
are
subject
to
the
regulatory
system
set
up.
one
is
where
congress
itself
makes
the
finding.
the
other
is
where
congress
leaves
it
to
the
court
to
make
a
finding.
and
the
sherman
act
of
course,
is
the
latter
type
of
statute.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
i
think
there
are
a
fair
number.
our
client
owns
several
and
i
do
know
of
other
companies
in
that
area
there.
there
is
a
substantial
number
of
fore
profit,
i
would
suppose
perhaps
as
many
in
the
southeast
since
that
is
a
newly
developing
part
of
the
country
as
almost
anywhere.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
i
believe
they,
in
fairness
i
could
say
they
are
increasing
a
little
bit
but
i
believe
it
is
probably
also
fair
to
say
the
economy
has
been
such
that
nobody
is
doing
much
anything
right
now.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
we
are
not
talking
so
much
about
health
care
as
such
although
we
are
relying
on
social
security,
we
are
also
--
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
excuse
me,
i
mean,
i
do
not
mean
to
say
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
i
was
thinking
of
fair
labor
standards
act.
i
was
thinking
of
occupational
safety
and
health
act.
i
was
thinking
of
the
wage
acts.
i
was
not
thinking
of
hill
burton
nor
was
i
thinking
of
the
social
security--
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
it
is
the
general
welfare
clause
but
again,
we
think
the
point
is
that
the
enactment
of
such
laws
under
any
source
of
power
for
the
congress
demonstrates
there
is
a
strong
federal
interest
in
the
provision
of
hospital
services
and
--
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
we
certainly
do
not
rely
on
that,
for
the
argument
we
make.
i
would
like
to
make
that
very
clear,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
your
honor--
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
you
say
are?
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
your
honor,
i
think
you
would,
i
think
our
position
is
you
would
have
to
have
an
analysis
of
the
market
and
see
what
sort
of
facts
were
being
alleged
with
respect
to
a
particular
occupation,
for
example,
with
respect
to
window
washers
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
had
a
case
involving
a
sherman
act
complaint
respecting
a
conspiracy
window
washers
just
like
you
had
complaints
in
which
courts
have
upheld
with
respect
to
employing
plasterers
and
with
respect
to
journeymen
or
rather
wholesale
plumbers,
you
would
have
to
see
whether
there
was
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
absolutely.
if
the
allegations
with
respect
to
substantial
effect
were
there.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
no,
not
necessarily
clearly.
i
think
you
would
have
to
again
make
an
analysis
as
the
ninth
circuit
court,
for
example,
did
in
paige
versus
worke
(ph)
and
you
would
have
to
find
what
was
the
nature
of
the
interstate
commerce
purchases,
how
important
they
were,
whether
they
were
a
continuing
part
of
the
business
of
this
business
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
as
i
recall
that
the
lowest
amount
that
i
recall
seeing
with
respect
to
quantitative,
the
quantitative
aspect
of
purchases
as
the
recent
seventh
circuit
decision
as
to
which
certiorari
was
earlier
denied
the
finest
p.
ernst
case
where
there
were
some
statement
that
this
contractor
who
had
been,
i
believe
indicted
under
the
sherman
act,
had
purchased
some
$10,000.00
or
rather
have
received
some
$10,000.00
from
hud
in
connection
with
the
building
project.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
of
the
restaurant's
total
purchases
and
also
of
the
total
purchases
with
respect
to
the
market.
mr.
john
k.
train
iii
i
believe
that
is
certainly
true
in
particularized
case
by
case
determination
based
on
a
pragmatic
economic
judgment
and
we
believe
that
here
the
pragmatic
judgment
is
the
congress
would
have
intended
to
protect
a
market
from
the
elimination
of
one
out
of
three
competitors.
