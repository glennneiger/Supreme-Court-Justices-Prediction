justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
know
what?
i
do
not
see
that
bears
on
your
case
at
all.
i
can
see
that
you
have
an
argument
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
or
under
the
occupational
health
and
safety
act,
but
the
spending
power
does
not
depend
on
interstate
commerce.
congress
can
expand
for
whatever
purpose
it
chooses
regardless
whether
it
bases
any
jurisdiction
on
commerce.
and
the
fact
that
it
may
choose
to
spend,
i
would
not
think
it
does
not
advance
or
detract
the
contention
of
its
jurisdiction--
