this
is
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioner
hospital
brought
a
sherman
act
action
alleging
that
the
respondents
had
conspired
to
block
the
expansion
and
relocation
of
the
petitioner's
hospital
for
purposes
of
monopolizing
the
business
of
providing
hospital
services
in
raleigh
north
carolina.
in
order
to
establish
the
requisite
nexus
within
the
state
commerce
the
petitioner
alleged
that
a
substantial
portion
of
its
medicine
and
supplies
came
from
out
of
state,
a
large
portion
of
its
revenues
came
from
out
of
state
insurance
companies.
the
brand
expansion
will
largely
financed
through
out
of
state
lenders
and
that
all
these
interstate
involvements
were
being
adversely
affected
by
the
respondent's
conduct.
nevertheless,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
on
the
pleadings
on
the
ground
that
the
provision
of
hospital
services
is
essentially
a
local
business
and
respondent's
conduct
only
indirectly
and
insubstantially
affected
interstate
commerce.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
we
reverse.
while
there
may
have
been
no
allegations
that
respondent
intended
to
affect
interstate
commerce
and
no
allegations
that
the
alleged
conduct
affected
market
price
or
forced
petitioners
out
of
state
suppliers
to
go
out
of
business.
our
decisions
indicate
that
the
requisite
nexus
with
interstate
commerce
under
the
sherman
act
is
established
as
long
as
the
conduct
in
question
as
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
the
complaint
in
this
case
fairly
read,
adequately
alleges
such
an
effect,
and
therefore
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
