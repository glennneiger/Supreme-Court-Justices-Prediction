mr.
ray
s.
bolze
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
submit
that
in
the
sherman
act
jurisdictional
issue,
we
should
again
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case.
my
client
is
rex
hospital,
a
non
--profit
public
hospital
in
raleigh
north
carolina
as
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
product
market
here
is
the
provision
of
hospital
services
in
raleigh
and
that
is
also
the
geographic
market,
raleigh
north
carolina.
the
provision
of
hospital
services
as
i
think
almost
everyone
knows
is
essentially
such
things
as
the
provision
of
a
hospital
room,
the
provision
of
nurses'
services,
the
provision
of
an
operating
room,
a
place
where
the
doctor
can
come
and
serve
the
patient,
provision
of
meals
to
you
while
you
are
in
the
hospital,
provisions
of
linens
on
your
bed,
all
these
various
factors.
and
it
is
true
that
at
one
time
or
other,
the
bed
that
you
are
lying
as
a
patient
for
a
week
in
the
hospital
may
have
come
from
interstate
commerce.
the
surgical
equipment
used
by
the
doctor
when
he
operates
upon
you
may
at
one
time
have
been
purchased
in
interstate
commerce
or
from
a
local
wholesaler
who
purchased
it
in
interstate
commerce.
and
that
the
medicines
and
drugs
administered
to
you
in
the
hospital,
may
at
one
time
have
come
from
a
manufacturer
or
a
shipper
in
interstate
commerce.
but
we
submit
in
virtually
every
walk
of
life,
this
is
the
case
indeed,
i
would
submit
that
in
virtually
every
interstate
transaction,
it
is
eventually
consummated
in
a
local
purchase
or
a
local
delivery
of
a
service.
that
does
not
mean
that
since
you
are
the
ultimate
recipient
on
that
chain,
you
become
a
part
of
interstate
commerce
for
sherman
act
regulations.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
your
honor,
my
first
answer
to
that
of
course
is
number
one,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
robinson
patman
act
but
the
sherman
act
and
it
is--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
and
i
have
not
checked
the
legislative
history
of
that
part
of
the
robinson
patman
act
but
i
would
submit
and
we
do
not
contend
here
that
hospitals
could
not
conspire
in
such
a
way
as
to
common
in
the
sherman
act
and
petitioner
makes
the
argument
here
that
this
is
a
constitutional
question.
can
hospitals
ever
come
in
under
sherman
act
and
we
do
not
argue
that,
we
take
the
same
position
as
was
stated
in
the
goldfarb
case
and
was
stated
in
the
yellow
cab
case
that
there
maybe
occasions
when
legal
services
or
taxicab
services
that
local
activities
could
be
of
such
a
nature
that
they
could
restrain
trade
under
the
sherman
act
and
i
would
submit
that
in
congress
in
running
a
robinson
patman
act
and
putting
that
statement
in
was
not
saying
that
hospitals
are
always
into
the
sherman
act,
you
have
to
look
at
the
individual
restraint,
which
is
what
we
are
doing
here.
so
i
do
not
think
that
that
does
get
to
our
question.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
or,
or
your
honor
if
the
hospital
as
is
in
most
of
these
supreme
court
cases,
if
the
hospital
conspires
with
the
out
of
state
drug
company,
such
as
to
frankfurt
distilleries
case,
such
that
you
have
a
restraint
on
that
interstate
flow
of
goods,
not
a
indirect
restraint,
a
direct
restraint
and
the
eight
circuit
and
the
bensinger
case
talked
about
the
amount
of
money
that
was
exact
issue.
i
think
there
was
only
several
thousand
dollars
involved
but
it
was
a
piece
of
machinery
coming
from
out
of
state
to
be
installed
in
a
local
restaurant
but
the
restraint
was
on
the
price
of
that
piece
of
machinery.
clearly
was
interstate
transaction
and
the
restraint
applied
to
therefore
was
sherman
act.
we
do
not
here
have
an
alleged
conspiracy
between
the
defendants
here
enrollee
and
these
out-of-state
suppliers'
drugs.
so
it
i
think
that
is
the
question
we
must
deal
with
the
restraint
here
alleged
and
whether
or
not
it
is
sufficient
to
be
considered
a
restraint
of
interstate
competition
as
an
--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
your
honor
i
do
not
think
your
perhaps
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
excuse
me.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
no
your
honor,
you
do
not
need
to
have
one
but
i
think
if
you
do
not
have
one
as
in
goldfarb,
this
local
activity
being
restrained
must
be
an
intrical
and
necessary
part
of
this
interstate
commerce
and
i
submit
ours
is
not
that
case
and
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
get
to
now
because
these
local
activities
such
as
the
purchase
of
goods
and
drugs
by
rex
hospital,
the
receipt
of
--
not
by
rex
hospital
by
plaintiff
and
the
receipt
of
a
products
used
at
the
hospital.
these
are
not
like
goldfarb;
these
are
not
the
dominant
ingredients
of
hospital
services.
i
submit
that
anyone
who
has
been
to
a
hospital
will
tell
you
that
the
dominant
ingredient
is
the
doctors
and
the
nurses.
those
facilities
provided
to
the
patient,
the
dominant
ingredient
is
not
the
drugs
which
came
in
at
one
time
or
the
bed
that
you
are
lying
upon.
now
this
is
the
distinction
between
this
and
goldfarb.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes
it
would
be
your
honor.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
at
one
time,
yes
it
did.
and
the
book--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes
your
honor.
and
the
chair
you
are
sitting
at
one
time
may
have
come
in
into
interstate
commerce.
i
mean
this
every
walk
of
life
has
this
connection
your
honor.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
certainly,
it
is
a
legislature.
there
are
so
many
thousand
dollars
worth
of
drugs
that
are
purchased
each
year
and
come
in
to
the
hospital.
whether
they
are
purchased
from
an
out-of-state
supplier
or
from
local
supplier
is
not
clear.
i
submit
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
says
they
all
came
from
out-of-state.
that
is
not
correct
but
yes
there
would
a
flow
of
drugs
every
year
to
the
hospital.
there
is
a
flow
of
food
every
year
to
the
hospital
which
comes
in
out
of
state
but
we
say
these
are
incidental
and
the
yellow
cab
case,
there
was
taxicabs,
3000
taxicabs
did
not
come
from
chicago.
but
yet
that
the
one
alleged
restraint
there
was
considered
to
be
intrastate
and
oregon
medical,
it
was
found
in
the
lower
court
and
by
the
supreme
court
that
there
were
complete
conspiracy
of
this
oregon
statewide
insurance,
medical
insurance
and
a
conspiracy
that
the
statewide
insurance
plan
would
not
compete
with
the
local
county
insurance
plan.
this
was
i
think
was
count
three,
the
only
count
that
the
district
court
went
off
and
then
said
there
was
no
interstate
commerce
and
it
was
found
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
by
justice
jackson
that
these
statewide
insurance
plans
did
not
make
payments
on
their
policies
across
state
lines
because
they
had
patients
who
belonged
to
this
insurance
plan
going
to
other
states
and
getting
medical
care
so
there
was
a
continuous
flow
of
there
also.
that
that
--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
exactly.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
that
is
the
allegation
here
your
honor
but
we
are
taking
that
allegation
as
true
that
that
restraint
is
not
sufficient
and
i
submit
your
honor--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes,
but
an
adverse
effect
on
a
delay
and
expansion
of
a
hospital
by
four
months,
by
91
beds
and
therefore
there
would
be
some
delay
in
drugs
coming
in
to
that
--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes,
but
i
would
say
your
honor
on
count
three
in
oregon
medical
which
one
i
am
discussing,
the
first
two
counts
the
district
court
found,
there
was
no
restraint
or
trait
on
the
facts.
so
we
do
not
get
interstate
commerce
on
the
third
count,
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
not
sufficient
for
interstate
purposes
and
that
supreme
court
upheld
it
on
that
finding.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
the
supreme
court
said
that
these
flow
of
goods
across
state
lines
which
would
be
restrain,
was
not
sufficient,
it
was
sporadic
and
incidental.
my
point
there
your
honor
is
--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
no,
your
honor.
your
honor
i
would
refer
to
your
statement
in
goldfarb
at
the
end
where
you
said
that
this
is
not
a
finding
that
every
legal
service
might
or
might
not
come
in
under
sherman
act.
we
deal
here
with
the
facts
in
that
case
which
was
that
the
price
fixing
on
legal
fees
for
a
title
search
was
an
intrical
part
of
an
interstate
transaction
between
mortgagees,
55%
of
which
were
in
the
dc.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes
your
honor
and
55%
of
the
mortgages
in
that
case
came
from
dc
in
the
fairfax
county
which
is
substantial
and
this
court
found
that
without
that,
the
mortgagees
said
we
will
not
grant
the
mortgage
unless
the
title
search
is
made
on
the
title
search
of
what
was
being
price
fixed.
so
it
is
a
direct
link
and
it
is
an
intrical
part.
i
think
that
is
in
line
with
the
frankfort
with
the
mandeville
farms
case,
direct
link.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
if
i
put
that
much
emphasis
on
the
personal
relationship,
i
am
talking
about
the
provision
of
hospital
services
which
includes
i
mean
the
primary
service
you
get
in
a
hospital,
i
think
it
is
a
service
provided
the
room,
the
nurses,
the
doctors,
the
use
of
that
operating
room.
it
is
not
the
same
effect
as
what
you
get
when
you
are
going
to
a
drugstore
to
buy
drugs.
you
are
not
going
into
a
hospital
primarily
to
buy
drugs;
you
are
going
primarily
for
hospital
service.
i
am
not
--
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
there
is
no
fine
line
in
this
court
has
said
it
many
times.
but
i
think
this
is
primarily
a
local
service
we
dealing
with
here
and
the
restraint
we
are
talking
about
is
a
restraint
on
local
competition.
this
court
recognized
in
yellow
cab,
interstate
commerce
is
not
intensely
practical
concept
drawn
from
a
normal
and
accepted
course
of
business.
you
must
look
at
the
common
understanding
in
the
community
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
facts
alleged,
the
restrain
alleged
is
interstate
or
intrastate
commerce.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
on
these
insurance
payments,
the
revenues
that
come
across
state
line.
petitioner's
hospital
does
receive
its
income
as
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint,
over
56%
of
it
from
insurance
companies,
primarily
bluecross
and
also
from
medicare
and
medicaid.
solicitor
general's
brief
states,
that
therefore
that
makes
95%
of
revenues
and
they
all
come
across
state
lines.
that
is
not
the
case.
that
is
an
error
in
that
brief.
number
one,
bluecross
payments
to
petitioner's
hospital,
the
vast
majority
in
their
own
hospital
comes
from
bluecross
in
north
carolina
just
like
most
states,
they
have
their
own
intrastate
bluecross.
so
it
is
not
an
interstate
transaction.
i
am
sure
they
receive
some
payments
from
insurance
companies
across
state
lines
but
not
majority.
secondly,
as
the
medicaid
and
medicare,
solicitor
general's
brief
is
misread.
there
also
as
it
is
clear
from
the
federation
of
american
hospital
brief
filed
and
in
our
brief.
medicaid
and
medicare
is
federal
funding,
it
is
paid
through
a
carriers
and
intermediaries
and
in
the
state
north
carolina,
it
is
paid
through
bluecross
of
north
carolina
when
petitioner's
hospital
has
treated
a
patient
that
qualifies
for,
medicare
payment.
the
hospital
submits
its
statement
to
bluecross
in
north
carolina,
the
intermediary
and
that
is
where
they
get
their
payment
for
medicare,
they
do
not
make
a
direct
submission
to
washington
dc.
here
again,
this
is
the
distinction
again
between
goldfarb
which
has
a
direct
relationship
from
outside
the
state
into
the
state,
we
do
not
have
that
here.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
no,
only
because
bluecross
in
north
carolina
is
the
intermediary
for
medicare,
if
it
was
some
other
insurance
company
in
north
caroline,
i
do
not
think
it
would
make
any
difference.
my
argument
is
still
the
same,
it
is
not
a
direct
link
between
the
hospitals
in
washington
dc.
i
would
not
care
who
made
it,
it
so
happens
that
intermediary
is
bluecross,
and
it
could
be
travelers.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes,
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
both
petitioner
itself,
it
is
--
they
just
make
the
statement,
they
have
these
receipts
of
payments
on
medicare
and
bluecross
but
it
so
happens
they
do
not
come
across
state
lines.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
they
received
some
insurance
payments
in
interstate
but
the
vast
majority
did
not.
furthermore,
in
this
medicaid
and
medicare,
it
is
federal
funding
on
a
general
welfare
clause
and
we
are
concerned
about
this
argument
because
first
of
all,
in
that
statute,
setting
up
medicaid
and
medicare,
the
amendment
of
the
social
security
act.
the
act
specifically
states
that
nothing
in
this
sub-chapter
shall
be
construed
to
authorize
any
federal
officer
or
employee
to
exercise
any
supervision
or
control
over
the
practice
in
medicine
or
the
manner
in
which
medical
services
are
provided,
stated
in
42usc
section
1395,
yet
what
petition
would
argue
here
by
all
these
connections
with
medicaid
and
medicare
is
that
since
they
receive
this
federal
funding
and
had
communication
involving
the
federal
funding.
we
should
take
these
contacts
with
the
federal
government
on
a
general
welfare
clause
and
use
those
to
we
submit
expenditures
to
extend
the
sherman
act
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
i
submit
that
is
far
reaching
and
furthermore
it
was
--
i
noticed
in
the
federal
list
papers,
madison's
papers
number
41
and
45,
it
discusses
the
general
welfare
clause
and
the
argument
that
was
made
by
opponents
to
the
constitution
that
the
grant
in
the
first
clause
about
general
welfare
and
the
common
defense.
people
were
saying
that
that
meant
federal
government
could
do
virtually
anything.
and
madison
specifically
said
there
that
that
language,
the
same
language
that
was
in
the
articles
of
confederation
that
they
could
provide
for
the
general
welfare
and
certainly
did
mean
they
could
do
anything.
in
fact
and
as
it
says
there,
the
clauses
following
thereafter,
the
specific
grants
of
power,
such
as
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
specifically
qualify
the
powers
of
general
welfare.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
i
do
not
it
was
rejected
on
this
question
to
the
general
welfare
clause
your
honor,
clearly
you
cannot
expand
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
this
court
has
never
interpreted
the
grant
of
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
congress
as
being
as
broad
as
their
power
of
funding
on
a
general
welfare
clause
which
is
what
is
being
argued
here.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
no
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
he
makes
very
clear
that
in
reading
the
power
to
the
federal
congress,
you
cannot
say
that
the
general
welfare
clause
gives
them
power
to
do
anything,
to
regulate
commerce.
you
have
to
look
at
the
specific
grants.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
but
not
to
control
intrastate
commerce.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
your
honor,
first
there
is
some
allegation
of,
some
treatment
of
patients
from
outside
the
state
and
this
brief
before
the
supreme
court
petitioner
apparently
has
dropped
that
as
one
of
its
arguments
but
be
that
is
not
may
--
i
am
sure
their
hospital
treats
some
patients
from
outside
the
state
and
they
might
received
medicare.
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
however
--
whatever
the
number
those
inpatients
are
and
even
if
they
do
use
medicaid
or
medicare,
that
still
is
an
incidental
contact,
it
certainly
would
not
be
nearly
as
substantial
connection
as
in
yellow
cab
where
you
have
the
transfer
of
interstate
travelers
to
their
local
homes.
so
i
would
submit
even
though
they
treat
some
patients
that
came
from
outside
that
state.
number
one,
petitioner
is
essentially
in
this
court
dropped
that
argument
and
secondly
i
submit
under
the
case
under
the
case
law
--.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes
your
honor,
still
on
the
complaint.
and
i
am
willing
to
go
with
that
that
they
do
treat
patients
coming
from
outside
the
state
and
i
am
submitting
under
the
case
law,
that
is
not
considered
as
sufficient
restraint
because
the
restraint
we
are
alleging
here
and
that
is
what
i
want
to
get
to
next,
what
is
the
language
in
the
apex
hosiery.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
dollar
amount,
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
a
local
restraint.
restraints
interstate
commercial
competition,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
dollar
amount,
we
are
talking
about
the
effect.
and
this
is
pointed
out
nowhere
more
clearly
than
the
apex
hosiery
decision
which
--
and
i
would
like
to
just
quote
a
couple
lines
from
in
this.
"it
was
in
this
sense
a
preventing
restraint
on
commercial
competition
that
congress
exercised
all
the
power
it
possessed
in
the
sherman
act."
further
quoting
on
justice
stone
opinion,
"the
supreme
court
has
never
applied
the
sherman
act
in
any
case
whether
or
not
involving
labor
organization
unless
the
court
was
of
the
opinion
of
there
was
some
form
of
restraint
upon
commercial
competition
in
the
marketing
of
goods
and
services."
restraints
upon
commercial
competition
have
been
condemn
only
when
their
purpose
or
effect
was
to
raise
or
fix
market
price,
it
is
this
sense
that
it
is
said,
that
the
restraints
actual
or
intended
prohibited
by
the
sherman
act
are
only
those
which
are
so
substantial
as
to
affect
market
prices.
i
submit
your
honor
that
is
what
the
test
of
the
substantiality
in
interstate
area
is.
not
a
measure
of
dollars
or
cents
but
a
measure
--
this
i
think
what
the
judge
craven
in
his
majority
opinion
was
talking
about
below
that
does
the
local
intrastate
restraint
have
an
effect
of
restraining
commercial
competition
in
interstate
commerce,
not
whether
it
delayed
$10,000.00
worth
of
goods
coming
into
the
state.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
you
honor
your
reconcile
it.
i
reconcile
the
same
way
that
the
judge
craven
did
below
when
talking
there
as
you
were
in
doctors
hospital
case
with
the
restraint
which
would
effectively
close
down
100
hospitals
in
two
state
area.
you
are
talking
about
interstate
commerce
i
do
not
even
think
that
is
an
effect
test,
that
is
an
inflow
test.
i
think
it
was
clearly
distinguish
by
judge
craven.
i
think
it
is
a
certainly
not
this
case.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
well,
there
is
one
third
of
very
important,
when
those
hospitals
alleged
and
restrained,
were
in
two
state,
philadelphia
and
denver
or
pennsylvania
and
denver.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
no,
sir
i
do
not
say
because
we
are
a
100
hospitals
involved.
here
we
talking
--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
your
honor,
i
would
not
rely
on
all
three.
i
submit
under
the
language
of
this
court.
the
test
in
each
sherman
act
cases
one
of
degree.
you
have
to
look
at
there.
i
would
look
all
three
of
those
issues.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
well,
i
think
closing
100
hundred
hospitals
compared
to
a
four
month
delay
in
the
expansion
of
91
bed
hospital
is
just
vastly
different,
as
to
its
effect
it
could
have
on
the
commercial
competition.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
i
say
you
can
look
at
the
dollar
value
your
honor
to
say
whether
or
not
it
would
have
substantial
effect
on
competition.
but
i
say
you
cannot
just
look
and
say
what
is
the
dollar
amount.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
i
say
that
the
effect
could
be
such
as
to
cause
a
suppression
in
the
commercial
competition
with
those
goods
and
services
because
there
are
so
many
coming
in.
so,
it
is
yes,
you
can
look
at
the
dollar
amount
and
cannot
object
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
i
contend
there
be
some
effect
on
the
flow
of
goods,
i
contend
there
to
be
no
effect
on
as
far
as
restraining
trade.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
no,
i
guess
there
is
--
i
feel
the
fact
that
the
defendant
there
was
operating
in
a
two
state
market
and
it
was
confirmed
with
100
hospitals.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
well,
i
do
not
think
i
am
your
honor
with
all
do
respect.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
you
honor,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
a
question
of
degree
in
each
case
and
i
think
there
it
was
critical.
i
would
have
to
look
at
three
tests
there.
i
do
not
think
you
can
look
at
just
the
dollar
amount.
your
honor
i
did
want
to
get
into
this
comparison
to
other
statutes,
fair
labor
standard
act
and
national
labor
relation
act.
i
would
submit
first
as
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
banty
brothers
translation
of
an
implication
drawn
from
the
special
aspects
of
one
statute
to
a
totally
difference
statute
as
treacherous
business.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
fair
labor
standard
act,
civil
right
act,
national
labor
relations
act
were
drawn
up
as
this
court
has
found
in
numerous
cases
including
marilyn
v.
worts
(ph)
fair
labor
standard
act
was
drawn
up
those
statutes
in
such
a
way
that
congress
made
a
decision
that
as
class
of
activities,
these
payments
of
substandard
wages
and
class
of
activities
could
as
a
whole
have
an
effect
in
interstate
commerce.
the
congress
did
not
find
that
in
the
sherman
act.
the
sherman
act
does
not
state
that
it
applies
to
any
local
restraint,
if
the
parties
involved
have
some
connection
with
the
interstate
commerce.
the
restraint
itself
must
be
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
powell,
i
think
put
it
very
clearly
in
(inaudible),
the
jurisdictional
inquiry
under
the
general
prohibitions
like
these
acts
and
section
one
of
the
sherman
act
turning
as
it
does
on
circumstances
presented
in
each
case
requiring
a
particularized
judicial
determination,
differ
significantly
from
that
requirement.
the
congress
itself
has
defined
the
specific
persons
and
activities
that
effect
commerce,
and
therefore
required
federal
regulation
comparing
yellow
cab
to
the
flsa
cases.
of
course,
the
language
of
this
statute
does
vary
too
which
is
in
our
brief.
i
would
submit
under
civil
rights
act.
if
you
so
much
just
treat
one
interstate
patients,
you
come
under
that
statue.
that
is
not
the
test
under
sherman
act.
finally,
i
would
get
back
to
the
quotes
in
yellow
cab
and
goldfarb,
we
are
not
arguing
that
a
hospital
can
in
no
way
conspire
such
as
the
restraint
interstate
state
trade.
we
are
saying
in
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
sherman
act
must
be
looked
at
in
each
case,
there
is
not
restraint
of
interstate
competition.
now,
this
does
not
leave
petitioner
without
some
relief.
north
carolina
like
most
states
has
a
mini
sherman
act.
in
fact,
its
language
is
identical
to
the
sherman
act
except
that
is
says
restraints
of
north
carolina
trade
rather
than
restrains
of
interstate
trade.
it
has
a
trouble
damage
provision
providing
people
with
suits.
they
can
go
into
state
court.
so
they
are
not
left
without
a
recourse.
now
referring
or
keeping
in
mind,
the
tremendous
increase
in
antitrust
cases
in
the
federal
courts,
i
think
there
were
457
antitrust
cases
in
the
federal
courts
in
1963
and
1400
in
67
and
1975
of
which
1375
were
non-government
civil
cases
like
these.
keeping
that
in
mind
and
the
fact
that
the
states
courts
and
state
statutes
are
there
and
are
being
used
for
more
and
more
each
day
and
the
aba
antitrust
general
each
year
puts
out
all
the
state
cases.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
that
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
just
because
of
that,
there
in
fact,
there
are
state
statutes
very
similar
to
there.
i
refer
back
to
the
language
of
chief
justice
hughes
in
jones
and
laughlin.
undoubtedly,
the
scope
of
this
power
must
be
considered
in
light
of
our
dual
system
of
government,
it
may
not
be
extended
so
as
to
embrace
effects
upon
interstate
commerce.
so,
indirect
and
remote
and
to
embrace
them,
if
you
have
a
complex
society
which
would
obliterate
and
set
up
a
completely
centralized
government.
the
question
is
necessarily
one
of
degree
and
there
is
a
question
of
degree
in
this
case.
i
would
submit
also
in
south
east
underwriters
case
which
is
quoted
quite
a
bit.
justice
black
after
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
in
enacting
the
sherman
act,
congress
went
to
its
entire
reach
on
the
constitutional
powers,
stated
right
there
after
about
our
dual
system
of
state
federal
and
referred
to
a
quote
by
senator
sherman
in
enacting
the
sherman
act
as
fallows;
it
is
to
arm
the
federal
courts
with
the
limits
of
their
constitutional
power
that
they
may
cooperate
with
the
state
courts
in
checking,
curbing
and
controlling
the
most
dangerous
combination
that
now
threaten
the
business
property
and
treat
the
people
of
united
states.
in
conclusion,
we
submit
the
subject
matter
test
under
the
sherman
act
is
one
of
degree,
based
on
each
fact
in
each
case.
there
is
no
clear
line
we,
submit
in
such
an
area,
the
lower
court
must
make
that
initial
decision
and
if
it
makes
that
decision
based
on
the
guidelines
set
down
by
this
court,
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
here
did.
in
his
decision--
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
he
may
have
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
if
he
dissented
on
all
three
accounts,
yes.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes
your
honor,
but
in
concludes
we
do
fear
on
these
type
of
cases
unless
--
since
no
clear
line
and
no
clear
rule
can
be
laid
down.
you
must
put
some
control
in
the
hands
of
the
lower
court.
it
applies
the
rules
correctly
as
we
think
it
did
here.
applied
the
guidelines,
unless
it
clearly
erroneous,
it
should
be
upheld.
it
was
upheld
here
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
also
by
fourth
circuit
en
banc
decision
which
we
feel
applied
your
rules
correctly
under
your
cases
and
it
should
be
upheld.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ray
s.
bolze
yes,
your
honor
i
take
it,
as
i
said,
i
was
quoting
south
east
underwriters
because
it
is
a
strong
case
for
sherman
act
enforcement
does
have
this
statement.
it
still
has
dual
system
and
it
does
quote
from
senator
sherman
about
the
dual
system,
and
that
is
the
purpose
that
i
was
quoting.
thank
you
your
honor.
