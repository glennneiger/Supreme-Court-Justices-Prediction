justice
byron
r.
white
this
does
not
bring
you
down
to
the
gulf
does
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
cover
--
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
the
contention
between
you
and
louisiana
is
where
the
line
begins
at
the
upper
end
of
the
lake,
there
is
no
map
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
exhibit
number,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
is
the
only
map
there
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
masters
map
to
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
instead
of
this
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
according
to
the
contention
the
two
states
are
not
in
contention
to
south
of
that,
justice
byron
r.
white
until
you
get
to
that
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
depends
on
how
long
your
baseline
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
tried
to
change,
if
you
had
a
fairly
long
baseline
it
would
not
make
much
difference
which
way
to
--
what
direction
the
river
was
running
when
it
run
into
the?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
claim
your
baseline
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
show
me
again
where
do
you
claim
your
historic
baseline.
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
to
the
right
of
that
is
a
man-made?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
louisiana?s,
where
is
the
louisiana?s?
justice
byron
r.
white
coastline,
baseline,
which
--
to
apply
the
median
principle?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
where
is
louisiana?s
baseline,
according
to
the
master.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
not
much
of
a,
so
how
long
is
the
masters
baseline?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
applying
the
equidistant
principle
out
in
the
gulf,
where
is
he
measuring
from?
just
the
two
ends
of
the
jetty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
when
was
the
last
addition
to
the
jetties
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
far
apart
are
the
jetties?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
shipping
channel
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
it
according
to
your
view,
jetties
are
all
located
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
texas.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
median
line
principle,
equidistant
median
line
principle
apply
only
when
there
is
not
only
a
dispute
between
two
states
or
countries
but
only
when
the
line,
you
can
not
say
the
line
is
ever
been
definitely
established
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume,
just
to
get
my
question
straight.
let
us
assume
that
when
texas
came
in
to
the
union,
there
was
a
language
used
or
at
least
there
would
be
no
question
whatsoever
what
the
boundary
line
was.
from
what
point
you
would
measure
and
what
angle
you
went
out
into
the
gulf
on,
let
us
assume
that
it
was
absolutely
clear
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
would
building
the
jetties
then
change
that
boundary?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
answer
it
no,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
you
would
have
answered
it
yes,
that
texas?
argument
about
what
its
historic
boundary
was
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
put
it
again.
the
master
establishes
what
the
line
is
now,
now
suppose
the
jetties
are
extended
next
year
on
a
different
angle
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
boundary
change
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
agree,
if
there
had
been
a
judicial
finding
of
what
the
boundary
was
or
where
it
started
in
1900
it
would
not
have
been
changed
by
the
building
of
the
jetties?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
fluctuate
depending
upon
what?
justice
white
(inaudible)
the
baseline
that
you
lay
out
in
the
coast,
to
start
with
do
you
think
it
has
to
be
the
same
coastline
that
was
recognized
as
part
of
louisiana?s
coastline
in
the
past
cases?
justice
white
(inaudible)
justice
white
(inaudible)
prior
case
in
this
court
that
louisiana?s
boundaries
went
three
miles
out
from
the
jetty?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
there
is
oil
development,
if
they
were
drilling
on
the
seabed
within
the
arc
that
the
united
states
though
belonged
to
louisiana
under
a
prior
case,
it
might
now
be
determined
it
belonged
to
texas?
