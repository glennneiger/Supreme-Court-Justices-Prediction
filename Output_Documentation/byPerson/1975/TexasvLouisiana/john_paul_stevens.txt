justice
john
paul
stevens
--
prior
to
1948
when
the
boundary
was
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river,
as
to
how
you
would
get
from
shore
to
three
leagues
out,
what
angle
would
be
appropriate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
asking
if
the
party
is
in
agreement
as
to
what
the
line
would
have
been
prior
or
1848.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
the
median
principle
operate
from
the
west
bank
of
the
river,
that
is
what
i
was
in
fact
not
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
my
question
a
little
differently.
if
the
line,
had
it
originated
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
instead
of
in
the
middle
of
the
river,
would
it
have
been
parallel
under
that
principle
to
a
line
which
originated
in
the
middle
of
the
river?
