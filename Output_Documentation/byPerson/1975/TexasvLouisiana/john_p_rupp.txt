mr.
john
p.
rupp
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
longer
any
dispute
between
the
parties
here
that
the
boundary
between
texas
and
louisiana
and
the
gulf.
it
must
be
constructed
by
reference
to
the
median
line
or
equidistant
principle
contained
in
article
xii
of
geneva
conventions.
that
is
that
the
boundary
must
be
aligned
that
is
at
all
points
equidistant
from
the
coastlines
of
the
two
states.
the
dispute
relates
instead
to
the
coastline
for
purposes
of
application
of
the
median
line
principle.
texas?
basic
position
is
that
the
relevant
coastline
is
the
coastline
that
existed
in
1845
when
it
was
admitted
to
the
union.
in
support
of
that
position,
texas
has
contended
first
that
the
congressional
resolution
annexing
texas,
recognized
that
texas
had
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
both
lateral
and
offshore
boundaries,
that
had
congress
undertaken
to
fix
that
boundary
as
of
1845,
it
would
have
used
the
equidistant
or
median
line
principle
and
it
would
have
applied
that
principle
to
the
1845
coastline.
and
finally
that
even
though
congress
did
not
fix
the
lateral
boundary
in
1845
or
thereafter,
the
boundary
nevertheless
remanded
inquit
and
neither
post
1845
evulsive
changes
in
the
coastline,
nor
post
1845
changes
in
domestic
and
international
law
can
operate
to
affect
the
position
of
a
lateral
boundary
which
has
remained
in
some
sense
established
since
1845.
we
believe
that
the
special
master
properly
rejected
texas?
positions
and
that
all
three
of
the
contentions
made
by
texas
in
support
of
that
position,
are
demonstrably
unsupportable.
the
operative
language
of
texas
relies
upon
in
support
of
its
argument
that
it
has
had
for
the
last
140
years,
a
lateral
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
appears
at
page
7
of
our
brief,
and
it
was
referred
to
by
my
brother
a
moment
ago.
that
language
which
is
taken
from
the
texas
boundary
act
reads
as
follows
describing
the
seaward
boundary
of
the
state
of
texas,
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river
and
running
west
along
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
land
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande.
in
united
states
versus
louisiana,
decided
by
this
court
in
1960,
this
court
held
that
the
language
to
which
i
have
just
referred
is
sufficiently
precise
to
sustain
texas?
claim
to
an
offshore
grant
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
extending
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
three
leagues
from
land.
at
the
same
time
however
the
court
recognized
in
that
case
that
at
the
time
of
texas?
annexation,
congress
paid
little
attention
to
the
location
or
existence
of
any
offshore
boundaries
for
the
state
of
texas.
as
the
special
master
noted,
congress
paid
no
attention
at
all
to
the
location
of
lateral
boundaries.
the
consuming
interests
at
that
time
were
instead
the
question
of
slavery,
the
debt
that
has
been
accrued
by
the
republic
of
texas,
and
our
deteriorating
relations
with
mexico.
texas
has
pointed
to
nothing
in
the
available
legislative
history
that
add
to
the
language
to
which
i
have
referred,
and
i
think
that
the
special
master,
we
submit
that
the
special
master
was
correct
in
concluding
that
it
is
impossible
on
the
basis
of
operative
language
upon
which
texas
relies
to
construct
the
lateral
boundary.
as
the
special
master
noted,
the
problem
is
getting
from
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
to
a
point
three
leagues
into
the
gulf,
and
i
am
quoting,?no
meridian
is
chosen,
no
angle
of
departure
from
the
coast
is
referred
to,
nor
is
any
point
in
the
gulf
three
leagues
from
land
specified.?
given
a
total
lack
of
relevant
language
in
the
statute,
there
is
no
indication
of
how
or
where
a
lateral
boundary
was
to
be
constructed.
what
the
special
master
was
confronted
with
then,
was
a
holding
by
this
court
that
texas?
offshore
boundary,
the
breadth
of
texas?
grant
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
extended
three
leagues
in
to
the
gulf.
the
instruments
upon
which
it
relied
in
arguing
that
it
had
an
inquit
lateral
boundary,
and
that
the
responsibility
of
the
special
master
was
simply
to
divine
that
boundary,
is
that
the
language
the
relevant
language
provides
no
clue
whatever
to
how
that
boundary
was
to
be
constructed.
events
occurring
since
1845
also
demonstrate
the
weakness
of
texas?
position.
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
if
i
may
to
a
diagram
that
appears
as
an
appendix
to
the
special
masters?
report.
although
texas
contends
that
it
has
had
for
the
last
140
years
an
inquit
boundary
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
you
will
note
from
the
map
that
when
texas
undertook
to
define
that
boundary
by
statue,
it
fixed
a
lateral
boundary
which
bears
no
relation
to
the
lateral
boundary
it
says
has
existed
for
the
last
140
years.
the
median
line
that
texas
from
the
1845
shoreline
that
texas
now
suggests
ought
to
be
regarded
to
this
court,
or
adopted
by
this
court
as
its
lateral
boundary
is
marked
as
green
line
number
one,
on
the
special
masters
map.
the
texas
statutory
line
is
green
line
number
three.
the
principles
used
to
construct
line
number
three
and
the
principles
that
texas
now
relies
upon
in
constructing
line
number
one
are
not
the
same
and
not
surprisingly
then
the
lines
bear
little
relation
to
one
another.
the
second
link
in
texas?
argument
in
support
of
its
proposed
boundary
line
we
believe
is
no
stronger
than
the
first,
and
that
is
even
if
lateral
boundaries
were
not
defined
at
the
time
of
texas?
annexation
or
subsequently,
had
the
united
states?
congress
undertaken
to
define
the
lateral
boundary
as
of
1845,
it
would
have
used
the
median
line
or
the
equal
distant
principle
and
it
would
have
applied
that
principle
to
the
1845
coastline.
we
dealt
with
this
contention
at
some
length
in
pages
14
through
18
of
our
brief.
let
me
only
say
here
that
although
the
median
line
or
equidistant
distant
principle
is
today
recognized
as
the
governing
principle
and
the
fixing
of
lateral
boundaries
between
adjacent
states
that
was
not
true
in
the
1800s.
the
instances
referred
to
by
texas
at
pages
25
through
28
of
its
brief
are
not
instances
in
which
the
median
distant
principle
was
used
to
delimit
areas
in
the
marginal
sea,
with
one
exception
and
that
is
the
(inaudible)
case.
but
that
case
did
not
apply
the
median
line
or
equal
distant
principle
for
which
texas
contends
here
and
which
beyond
the
state
of
louisiana
agrees
the
proper
principle.
the
court
in
that
case
used
the
right
angle
principle
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
there
are
two
ways
under
the
geneva
convention?s
to
delimit?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
wish
i
could
answer
that
question
yes
or
no?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well
i
think
the
answer
is
no
and
the
reason
that
it
is
no
is
that
this
court
has
held?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
do
not
think
that
follows.
let
me
backup
for
one
moment,
this
court
held
in
united
states
versus
texas,
that
texas
did
not
have
a
recognizable
claim
to
lands
offshore.
recognized
however
in
united
states
versus
california,
that
texas
and
other
gulf
states
might
nonetheless,
and
california,
might
nonetheless
exercise
some
police
powers
in
those
areas.
now,
the
historic
element
of
this
case
comes
into
the
picture
only
because
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
congress
permitted
states
to
exercise
one
or
two
options.
either
the
three
league
option
if
based
upon
historic
events,
or
an
unconditional
three
geographic
mile
grant.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
our
position
is
that
it
would
not,
once
it
is
fixed
in
the
decree
of
this
court
it
would
not.
i
should
add
however,
that
the
parties
have?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
problem
is,
i
cannot
answer
yes
or
no?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
problem
is
that
we
are
talking
about
a
controversy
which
has
relevance
only
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
it
is
the
united
states?
position
that
a
decree
in
this
court
now
establishing
lateral
boundaries
between
texas
and
louisiana
and
lands
retained
by
the
united
states
under
the
submerged
lands
act
will
finally
fix
the
boundaries.
we
believe
further
however
that
the
coordinates
of
a
line
ought
to
be
incorporated
in
an
agreement
between
the
parties
and
presented
to
the
congress
so
that
any
potential
ambiguity
is
removed.
this
is
the
first
case
that
presents
to
this
court
under
the
submerged
lands
act
the
question
of
lateral
boundaries.
those
boundaries
normally
under
international
law
will
continue
to
fluctuate
until
fixed
by
agreement
and
possibly
by
judicial
decree,
although
that
has
not
been
settled
yet.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
it
depends
upon
both
natural
changes
in
the
coastline
as
well
as
evulsive
changes.
now
the
change?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
i
included
man-made
changes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
man-made
changes
and
normally
evulsive
and
the
geneva
conventions
specifically
include
harbor
works
that
form
an
integrated
part
of
the
harbor
network
as
part
of
the
coastline.
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
jetty
on
the
east
forms
part
of
louisiana?s
coastline.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
for
you
to
hold
now
for
purposes
of
the
lateral
boundary
dispute
with
which
we
are
now
presented
that
texas?
jurisdiction
cuts
the
eastern
jetty
and
extends
eastward
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
from
the
natural
mouth
of
the
sabine,
we
regard
as
wholly
inconsistent
without
prior
holding.
it
is
clearly
inconsistent
with
the
governing
legal
principles
under
the
geneva
convention
which
this
court
has
applied
to
cases
such
as
this
arising
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
united
states
versus
california
when
this
court
was
presented
with
the
duty
of
determining
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
inland
waters,
this
court
referred
to
the
geneva
conventions.
this
court
incorporated
evulsive
man-made
changes
in
determining
the
location
extent
of
california?s
inland
waters.
in
united
states
versus
louisiana,
the
last
case
involving
these
two
states
in
this
court,
again
the
court
held
that
man-made
changes,
harbor
works,
affected
the
location
of
the
boundary.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
right
i
am
sorry.
it
did
not?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no
that
is
not,
that
is
right,
it
did
not.
what
the
court
held
in
that
case
of
course
was
that
for
purposes
of
measuring
the
three
mile
limit
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
eastern
jetty
was
part
of
louisiana?s
coastline
and
that
louisiana
could
use
an
arc
extending
three
miles
from
the
eastern
jetty.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
it
is
relevant?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
it
is
not
conclusive,
no,
no,
it
is
not
conclusive.
this
court
has
not
held,
as
i
just
indicated,
has
not
confronted
a
case
involving
an
issue
of
the
location
of
a
lateral
boundary
between
two
states
offshore.
we
believe
that
that
logic
of
the
prior
opinions
leads
to
the
result
that
was
reached
here,
recommended
here
by
the
special
master.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
exactly,
that
is
correct,
that
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
seas
and
the
coastline
to
be
used
for
the
present
purposes
should
be
the
same.
