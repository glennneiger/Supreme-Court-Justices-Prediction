justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
attorney
general,
is
there
a
counterpart
of
that
map
in
our
papers?
it
looks
different
from
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask,
is
there
a
counterpart
of
it
here?
i
cannot
see
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
in
our
papers
that
i
can
look
at
rather
than
try
to
get
from
here
and
i
cannot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
one
of
the
(inaudible)
argument
that
will
pass
that
point,
is
there
a
map
in
the
briefs
or
in
the
report
that
shows
the
upper
end
of
the
lake?
justice
jr.
and
louisiana?s
position
was
that
you
then
go
see
what
three
miles
from?
