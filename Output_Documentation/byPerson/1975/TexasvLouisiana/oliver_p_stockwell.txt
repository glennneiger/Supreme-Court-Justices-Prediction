mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
not
try
to
duplicate
the
argument
that
has
just
been
made.
there
is
one
thing
though
that
i
want
to
clear
up.
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
white,
when
we
argued
the
last
texas
boundary
case
asked
mr.
mcdaniel?s
about
the
effect
of
that
judgment
on
the
offshore
boundary.
and
mr.
mcdaniel?s
said,
this
is
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
that
is
correct,
it
does
not
affect
united
states.
i
do
not
think
because
as
to
united
states,
the
three-league
limit
only
comes
as
far
as
our
historic
boundary,
and
congress
has
not
consented
for
us
to
extend
it
here
anymore
than
they
have
consented
for
us
to
extend
it
up
here
north
of
the
32nd
degree
of
latitude.
so
we
have
no
contrary,
so
mr.
mcdaniel
was
saying
that
in
the
extension
of
1848
it
really
did
not
affect
the
offshore
boundary.
i
think
in
this
case,
one
of
the
salient
facts
that
as
i
see
is
the
fact
that
the
jetty
starts
on
the
coast
of
louisiana
and
it
extends
out
in
the
gulf,
so
it
is
an
extension
of
the
coastline
of
louisiana.
and
the
master
actually
determined
that
the
jetties
were
part
of
the
river
to
some
extent,
because
he
said
that
in
the
expert
testimony
was
put
in
justified
the
fact
that
you
could
say
that
was
an
extension
of
the
river
mouth.
but
he
said
he
did
not
have
to
hold
it
on
that
basis
because
on
geneva
convention,
it
would
be
the
coast
of
louisiana
to
the
end
of
the
jetties.
and
they
have
the
low
water
mark
at
the
end
of
the
jetties
which
about
1800
feet
approximately
what
mr.
hill
said,
and
that
was
a
baseline,
which
is
a
baseline
for
measuring
the
territorial
sea
of
the
united
states.
and
in
under
article
xii
of
the
convention,
it
is
measured
from
that
baseline,
so
i
think
that
the
master
was
absolutely
correct
in
taking
the
modern
coastline
since
you
had
never
had
a
boundary
established,
it
was
maybe
incorrect
boundary,
but
the
texas
never
had
recognized
any
boundary.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
the
record
would
demonstrate
that
all
of
these
parties
have
treated,
more
or
less
down
the
center
of
the
jetties
as
being
the
boundary
between
texas
and
louisiana.
now,
of
course,
we
disagree
about
the
fact
that
their
median
line
is
correct,
because
the
special
master
in
his
report
said
that
there
was
not
enough
of
the
louisiana
coastline
of
1845
to
justify
the
median
line
that
texas
was
suggesting.
so
we
take
issue
on
that.
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
i
would
like
to
cover
before
i
get
into
that
is
this
north,
as
it
comes
into
the
sabine
river.
the
sabine
river
comes
in
the
sabine
lake,
there
is
no
dispute
over
the
fact
that
that
is
three
hours,
texas
in
their
brief
admit
that
when
they
were
admitted
in
the
union
1845
that
their
boundary
was
on
the
western
most
branch
of
the
sabine.
so
at
that
time
there
is
no
question
about
where
their
boundary
was,
there
is
no
question
about
the
channel
that
was
used.
now
in
1838,
which
was
before
texas
was
admitted,
the
united
states
surveyed
this
land
for
the
purposes
of
issuing
patents
and
made
townships
out
of
it.
and
they
surveyed
it
to
the
west
branch
of
the
sabine
river,
and
they
let
louisiana
select
that
land
under
the
swap
lands
act.
now
the
only
reason
louisiana
could
select
it
was
that
united
states
treated
that
as
being
in
louisiana,
and
then
louisiana
patent
that
land
out
to
individuals
who
owned
it
today
and
pay
taxes
in
(inaudible).
now
one
of
the
important
things
as
far
as
louisiana
is
concerned
is
that
the
same
surveyor
held
all
of
these
channels
were
navigable,
so
that
meant
that
louisiana
owned
the
beds
of
those
navigable
streams.
now
what
the
master
has
done,
he
admits
that
these
islands
were
patented
to
louisiana
and
patented
out
by
louisiana,
but
yet
he
says
that
they
are
now
going
to
be
in
texas,
so
that
means
that
louisiana
has
given
up
these
navigable
waters
and
also
they
have
given
up
this
taxes
on
this
private
properties.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
over
three
miles,
about
three
and
a
half
miles
i
think.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
yes
sir.
our
position
was
we
had
a
statute
too,
that
defines
our
boundary,
and
it
commenced
at
the
head
of
the
jetties
and
took
a
line
across
the
jetties
and
went
due
south.
and
the
united
states
line,
this
was
median
line
based
on
the
line
across
the
jetties
and
after
the
master
decided
that
was
a
proper
line
we
have
accepted
it,
so
we
do
not
allege
the
line,
and
we
were
alleging
to
the
time.
so
the
master
in
making
this
determination
about
these
operands
about
the
right
channel,
said
something
about
the
amount
of
water
that
came
through.
but
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
see,
how
the
master
could
put
the
land
that
was
already
determined
to
be
in
louisiana
over
to
into
texas.
and
that
is
going
to
be
the
effect
of
this
decree.
it
is
going
to
affect
title
to
a
lot
of
property,
since
it
came
through
the
swamp
land
grants
to
louisiana
and
was
patented
out
by
louisiana,
i
am
talking
about
over
a
hundred
years
ago.
so,
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
to?
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
well,
i
think
the
only
reason
that
louisiana
could
get
the
swamp
lands
was
it
had
to
be
in
louisiana.
in
other
words
they
were
entitled
as
you
know
to
select
overflow
lands
in
that
porters,
and
they
did
that
they
made
these
selections
and
then
they
issued
patents
to
individuals.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
well,
i
think
that
might
be
a
legal
question.
i
mean,
i
do
not
know,
maybe
some
prescriptive
period.
but
anyway
the
master
admits
this
was
all
patented
to
louisiana,
and
there
is
no
question
of
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
louisiana,
because
right
now,
they
would
be
in
texas
and
louisiana.
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
same
issue
arose
right
north
of
that
orange
texas,
what
they
call
it
aniurous,
and
they
had
two
channels.
and
the
department
of
interior
determined
that
the
western-most
channel
was
the
channel
to
be
used
because
that
was
the
channel
on
the
west
bank
at
which
the
texas
boundary
was.
now
that
is
the
whole
position
we
take
is
that
the
channel
on
which
the
west
bank
of
texas
boundary
was,
west
bank
of
texas
boundary
is
the
channel
to
be
used
and
the
line
was
only
moved
to
the
middle
of
that
channel.
thank
you.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
yes
mr.
blackmun,
of
course
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
louisiana
had
title
to
these
beds
or
these
streams
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
recognized
that
the
boundary
is
extended
to
this
west
part.
now
the
united
states
could
not
take
that
away
and
give
it
to
texas
and
as
1848
act,
that
same
issue
came
up
in
mississippi
versus
louisiana.
and
the
court
held
that
once
the
state
had
territory,
the
congress
could
not
take
it
and
give
it
to
another
state.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
from
the
end
of
the
jetty,
because
that
determines?
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
that
is
correct,
under
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
that
is
correct
sir.
in
other
words
they
say
that
--
in
other
word
if
you
adopt
that
theory
they
get
the
whole,
they
get
both
of
the
jetties.
therefore
we
would
not
be
able
to
use
the
jetties
to
determine
our
territory
--
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
well
it
might
be,
yes.
i
mean
if
the
court
would
hold
that
the
texas
boundary
extends
to
where
they
say
it
is,
it
would
put
part
of
what
louisiana
has
already
been
awarded
into
texas.
and
of
course
one
of
the
things
justice
is,
that
the
fact
that
i
think
the
court
started
out
to
have
some
uniformity
to
the
coastline
and
through
these
various
issue
like
based
under
the
convention.
and
what
they
will
do
here
if
this
was
not
followed
would
be
creating
a
real
anomaly
as
far
as
this
area
around
these
jetties
is
concerned.
thank
you
sir.
