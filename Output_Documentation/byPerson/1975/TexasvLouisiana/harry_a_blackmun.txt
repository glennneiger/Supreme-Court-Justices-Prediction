justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
before
you
get
to
that,
as
i
understand
there
is
no
dispute
of
the
area
of
the
river
now
between
30
and
32.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
latitude
and
you
referred
to
12
maps
that
had
been
agreed
upon,
and
apparently
are
to
be
deposited
with
the
land
departments
of
each
state.
do
you
expect
us
to
incorporate
those
maps
in
our
decree
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
expect
us
to
incorporate
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
what
the
only
controversy
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
how
are
we
to
incorporate
them
in
the
decree
if
they
are
not
here?
or
are
they
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
going
to
submit
incorporation
language,
or
do
we
have
to
work
it
out
ourselves?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
what
the
issues
are,
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
that
two
degree
area
up
there,
and
i
am
trying
to
pin
you
down
as
to
whether
you
have
language
that
will
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
enable
us
to
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
degree
area
and
i
just
wanted
to
confirm?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
on
your
theory
had
the
river
come
in
to
the
gulf,
directly
due
east,
then
the
median
line
would
also
go
directly
due
east?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
the
two
shoulders
had
been
north
and
south
of
one
another,
at
the
point
of
the
mouth
of
the
river,
is
not
my
question
then
to
a
possibel
answer.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)on
your
theory
of
--
what
part
of
the
eastern
jetty
be
in
louisiana
and
part
in
texas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
eastern
jetty
attached
itself
to
what
is
conceded
as
louisiana
land
at
the
mouth
of
the
river?
i
take
it,
it
does
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
land
most
end
of
the
jetty.
to
what
does
it
attach,
the
eastern
jetty?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then
part
of
it
is
in
louisiana?
no?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
do
not
care
whom
it
belongs,
i
want
to
know
is
it
in
louisiana,
any
part
of
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
it
attaches
to
louisiana?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
let
us
forget
about
ownership.
at
the
point
of
attachment
it
is
certainly
is
in
louisiana,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
how
far
out
is
it
in
louisiana?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
am
not
interested
in
ownership,
i
am
interested
in
location.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
missouri
river
is
full
of
instances
where
property
on
the
other
side
belongs
to
the
state
on
the
other
side
of
the
river.
so
that
the
fact
that
the
island
might
be
louisiana
territory,
but
yet
beyond
the
west
side
of
the
line
is
not
conclusive
i
suppose.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
went
three
miles
seaward
from
the
end
of
that
jetty,
or
from
the
middle,
from
the
line
between
two
jetties
or
from
the
end
of
the
jetty?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you
started
on
the
north?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
as
between
the
united
states
and
louisiana,
that
arc
divided
the
rights
to
the
seabed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
under
submerged
lands
act.
now
texas?
position
in
this
case
would
mean
that
part
of
that
property
was
in
that
arc
would
belong
to
the
state
of
texas?
