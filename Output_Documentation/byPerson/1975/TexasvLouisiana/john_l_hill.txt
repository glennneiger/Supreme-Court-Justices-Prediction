mr.
john
l.
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
major
unresolved
issue
before
us
is
which
of
two
proposed
lateral
boundary
lines
should
be
adopted
by
the
court
in
its
final
decree.
that
would
in
the
court?s
judgment
properly
fix
the
gulfward
extension
of
the
lateral
boundary,
between
the
states
of
louisiana,
the
states
of
texas
and
the
united
states.
now,
during
the
trial
before
the
master
in
new
orleans,
which
constitutes
almost
1200
pages
of
testimony
and
large
number
of
exhibits,
there
were
many
lateral
lines
that
were
in
contention
and
that
were
proposed
about
parties.
but
the
only
two
lines
that
are
still
viable
and
in
contention
are
the
texas
so-called
middle
line
or
median
line,
which
begins
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine,
the
natural
mouth
of
the
river
sabine
and
extends
gulfward
three
-
leagues
on
a
middle
line
or
median
line
principle.
which
we
believe
to
be
the
only
correct
and
equitable
line
that
will
fairly
divide
the
territorial
sea
between
these
two
states
which
is
all
we
seek
to
do,
which
is
all
we
can
seek
to
do
here
is
just
fairly
divide
this
territory.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
neither.
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
do
not
speak
of
it
as
an
agreement.
we
speak
of
it
as
the
ascertainment
on
the
ground
of
the
facts
and
legal
principles
that
this
court
has
already
enunciated
in
your
first
opinion.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
we
do,
with
the
only
controversy
left
down
to
the
natural
mouth
of
the
river,
involves
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
they
are
in
the
exhibits
if
it
pleases
the
court.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir,
we
would
be
happy
to
do
so.
we
think
that
the
proper
decree,
since
the
court?s
proper
decree
here
should
be
that
the
lateral
gulfward
extension
shall
be
a
middle
line
or
median
line,
extending
from
mouth
of
the
gulf
that
would
be
sent
back
for
that
principle,
and
we
have
plotted
at
the
coastline.
we
think
the
proper
coastline
is
the
historic
coastline
as
we
say.
but
i
think
the
proper
decree
would
be
for
us
to
do
that,
and
at
the
same
time
you
settle
the
middle
pass
issue
for
us.
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
hill
we
do.
we
have
co-ordinance,
we
have
fixed
position
all
through
the
geographic
middle
of
the
sabine
river.
we
have
worked
very
hard
to
do
that,
and
we
have
produced
a
result
that
we
believe
comports
with
justice
stewart?s
opinion,
justice
whites?
opinion,
in
the
first
ground
of
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir,
but
we
are
alright
in
that
we
could?
mr.
john
l.
hill
clearly.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
sir,
well
we
certainly
have
the
help
in
the
record
and
i
do
not
think
that
presents
any
difficulty
at
all.
we
do,
and
i
do
not
intend
to
dwell
on
the
middle
pass
issue.
i
think
so
clearly
in
favor
of
the
master's
recommendation
that
the
middle
pass
be
used
as
the
northern
end
of
sabine
lake
that
unless
you
have
some
questions
about
it,
i
do
not
intend
to
take
any
of
my
time
with
it.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
it
is
different
in
this
respect
and
i
should
like
to
explain
it
if
i
may?
mr.
john
l.
hill
there
is
to
this
extent.
this
is
an
exact
reproduction?
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
hill
so
the
difference
between
what
is
before
the
court
on
the
exhibit
and
what
is
in
the
masters?
exhibit
here
besides
from
the
obvious
enlargement,
is
the
louisiana
arc.
and
the
fact
that
the
only
two
lines,
we
have
put
on
this
map
are
the
lines
still
in
contention.
you
will
notice
on
the
master's
exhibit,
there
are
many
other
lines,
and
no
use
clogging
this
discussion
with
lines
that
everyone
has
abandoned.
the
only
reason
for
putting
the
arc
in
your
previous
decrees,
you
have
decreed
that
louisiana
is
entitled
to
measure
the
breadth.
mr.
john
l.
hill
if
you
could
justice
brennan,
if
you
will
refer
to
the
masters
exhibit
but
ignore
all
of
the
lines
that
are
on
it.
except
what
is
designated
i
believe
line
number
one,
the
texas
median
line,
and
the
us
line
which
is
line
number
five.
it
is
otherwise
the
same
with
the
exception
of
drawing
the
louisiana
arc,
and
we
did
that
solely
to
refresh
the
memory
of
the
court,
a
one
unique
feature
of
this
controversy.
that
is
a
previous
decree
of
this
court
have
said
that
louisiana
may
measure
the
breadth.
it
is
a
very
important
point
in
this
case,
which
was
overlooked
by
the
masters,
consistently
overlooked
by
the
united
states
and
louisiana.
your
decree
states
that
louisiana
may
measure
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
from
that
jetty,
that
decision
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
the
lateral
boundary
would
be
in
their
territorial
sea
or
in
our
territorial
sea.
but
we
want
to
put
it
in
here
so
you
can
see
that
the
louisiana
territorial
sea
is
rather
unusual
and
that
it
comes
on
an
arc
and
then
joins
in
there,
three
miles
lines,
which
of
course
they
are
taking
under
the
unconditional
grant
of
the
submerged
land
act.
they
are
taking
three
miles
which
they
try
to
take
a
historic
three
leagues.
it
was
rejected
by
this
court,
we
tried
to
take
historic
three-league
and
it
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
so
you
have
a
state
on
the
one
hand
with
a
three-league
grant
already
established
by
this
court,
and
louisiana
on
the
other
hand
with
a
three
mile
grant,
but
allowing
them
to
measure
that
three
mile
grant
from
the
eastern
edge
of
the
jetty,
under
the
geneva
convention,
holding
that
that
was
a
part
of
their
coastline.
so
that
actually
they
a
have
a
territorial
sea
on
breadth,
that
is
very
unusual
looking
animal,
as
a
result
of
those
two
cases.
so,
that
is
what
this
map
is
for,
i
hope
it
will
be
useful
as
we
go
along
in
our
discussion.
mr.
john
l.
hill
not
in
the
briefs,
if
it
please
the
court,
but
there
is
an
exhibit
if
you
will
go
back
to
our
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
not
in
the
briefs,
in
only
the
exceptions
to
the
masters
report,
justice
white.
but
there
is
a
map
we
have
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
believe
that
it
is
5a.
i
beg
your
pardon.
we
did
file
a
brief
reply
to
the
exception
filed
by
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
mr.
york
now
showed
me
that
on
page
four
of
that
brief
there
is
a
description
of
the
middle
pass,
the
west
pass
and
the
east
pass.
if
i
may
refer
you
to
that,
it
is
a
very
short
brief,
it
is
showed
on
page
four.
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
only
one
in
the
briefs,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
l.
hill
not
attached
to
as
an
exhibit
to
his
report.
there
is
in
the
record,
yes
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
justice
blackmun
has
a
larger
exhibit
that
he
is
referring
to
justice
stewart.
now,
the
only
significant
as
long
as
we
are
on
that
point
and
the
court
is
not
expressing
an
interest
in
it,
a
middle
pass
is
clearly
the
proper
pass,
the
mark
geographic
middle
of
the
river
at
that
point.
the
only
reason
louisiana
ever
contended
that
the
west
past
should
be
used
was
because
louisiana
owns
some
island,
they
claim
to
own
some
island,
west
for
the
middle
pass.
the
court
properly,
master
properly
found
that
is
totally
immaterial
to
the
question
of
where
the
geographic
middle
of
the
river
is,
whether
there
is
some
island
west
of
it
or
east
of
it.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
that
is
correct.
and
then
the
middle
pass
i
think
clearly
is
going
to
be
statement
of
this
court.
so
we
come
on
down
then
to
the
major
issue
in
dispute
which
gives
us
about
12,000
acres
of
offshore
lands
that
are
in
dispute,
and
the
area
that
the
united
states
is
affected
by
are
here
beyond
the
louisiana
arc,
some
7500
acres
in
the
little
triangle
here,
that
is
in
dispute,
that
you
can
get
down
to
what
the
lawsuit
is
about.
that
is
texas's
position,
that
texas
has
had,
a
lateral
boundary,
a
three
marine
league
seaward
in
to
the
gulf
and
is
now
a
contested
area
ever
since
the
1845-49
period.
i
am
sure
the
court
knows
why,
and
this
title
's
litigation
we
refer
to
the
1845-49
period
is
related
to
texas.
i
will
pick
that
up
in
a
little
while
there
is
a
very
good
reason
for
it.
as
most
everyone
is
written
on
this
subject,
to
read
this
that
we
would
deed
it,
this
little
flavor
from
the
united
states
government,
from
the
west
bank
to
the
middle
of
the
river
in
1848,
had
the
same
standing
historically
by
the
very
terms
of
the
submerged
land
act
as
our
original
historic
grants.
so
when
i
speak
of
1845-49
that
is
why
i
am
using
that
term.
the
united
states
and
stanley
agrees
with
the
position
that
i
just
stated.
they
agree
that
texas
had
a
historic
three
league
lateral
boundary,
and
they
conceived
this
in
their
briefs,
they
argue
with
the
fact
that
it
was
not
precisely
delimited.
we
will
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
the
position
of
course,
our
basic
position
is
based
on
a
number
of
historic
items
and
this
has
been
so
well
documented
in
your
previous
cases
that
to
get
a
little
bit
of
posing
on
the
court
to
go
over
all
of
it,
i
will
try
to
hurriedly
do
so.
of
course,
first
the
united
states,
a
party
to
this
litigation
and
the
state
of
texas,
a
party
to
this
litigation,
entered
a
stipulation
that
appears
at
394
us
1
which
was
the
third
chapter
of
the
second
united
states
versus
louisiana
case.
and
this
is
what
it
said.
the
united
states
has
accepted
texas
three-league
boundary
opposite
the
western
half
of
sabine
pass.
not
as
a
boundary
as
it
existed
when
the
state
came
into
the
union
in
1845,
but
as
one
approved
by
congress
before
the
passage
of
the
submerged
land
act,
and
as
such
equally
entitled
to
recognition
under
section
2(b)
of
the
act.
the
land
identified
in
the
stipulation
as
the
land
to
be
recognized
as
texas
historic
offshore
boundary
includes
the
1849
extension,
but
the
united
states
reserves
the
effectives
of
that
extension
as
against
the
claims
for
example,
as
might
be
asserted
by
louisiana.
alight,
that
reservation
which
carried
out,
louisiana
made
a
context
of
it,
and
that
is
what
the
original
opinion
in
this
case
dealt
with
as
to
whether
it
was
valid
against
louisiana?s
claim.
and
this
court
held
that
it
was,
that
is
already
decreed
law
by
this
court
in
the
face
of
louisiana?s
contest,
you
rejected
their
claim
of
the
west
bank
and
judicially
decreed
texas
historic
boundary
to
which
the
state
of
texas
and
the
united
states
had
already
agreed.
so
louisiana?s
contest
has
been
rejected,
and
the
stipulation
of
united
states
is
still
binding
on
them.
now
that
historic
boundary
of
course
is
based
on
a
lot
of
historic
documents,
again
as
so
hurriedly
because
it
is
so
much
a
part
of
the
previous
cases.
our
1836
texas
boundary
act
was
the
fundamental
historic
document
that
from
and
after
the
passage
of
this
act,
passed
when
we
were
an
independent
nation
and
a
republic,
the
civil
and
political
jurisdiction
of
this
republic
(b)
and
is
hereby
declared
to
the
extent
of
the
following
boundaries
to
with,
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river
and
running
west
along
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
land
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
so
forth.
when
congress
annexed
us
as
a
state
in
1845,
this
mind
you
was
the
territory
that
the
republic
of
texas
considered
that
it
was
properly
included
within
its
boundaries,
and
rightfully
belonging
to
the
republic.
that
beginning
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
sabine,
three
leagues
gulfward
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
rio
grande.
what
did
congress
say
when
they
annexed
us?
that
congress
does
consent
that
the
territory
properly
included
within
and
rightfully
belonging
to
the
republic
of
texas
maybe
erected
into
a
new
state.
it
did
say,
subject
to
the
adjustment
by
this
government
of
all
questions
of
boundary
that
may
arise
with
other
government,
you
will
remember
the
history
that
the
united
states
was
concerned
about
where
the
western
boundary
of
our
state
would
be,
where
the
boundary
would
be
with
mexico,
and
they
wanted
to
press
every
claim
that
texas
rightfully
had
against
all
contestants
and
participants,
and
that
is
why
that
language
was
used,
there
was
never
any
contest
over
our
eastern
boundary.
never,
the
only
contest
that
is
ever
reasoned
about
is
louisiana's
rejected
claim
that
we
did
not
own
half
of
the
sabine
river.
we
came
along
to
the
treaty
that
we
then
entered
into
with
mexico
following
this
series
of
events.
the
language
and
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
said,
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
republic
shall
commence
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
three
leagues
from
land
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
and
from
that
and
so
forth.
three
leagues
river,
there
can
be
no
question
any
longer
about
the
fact
that
we
had
our
historic
boundary
and
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
that
boundary
included
a
lateral
boundary,
whether
or
not
congress
said,
when
it
said
beginning
at
the
middle
of
the
river
sabine
and
to
line
three
leagues,
the
mere
fact
that
it
did
not
stake
it
out
by
some
call
or
some
precise
delimitation.
we
believe
that
does
not
defeat
the
fact
that
texas
had
and
had
to
have
a
historic
lateral
boundary
connecting
that
beginning
point
and
that
ending
point
at
that
time.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes.
and
you
do
remember,
of
course,
i
did
not
read
it,
but
did
not
think
it
is
necessary
when
they
moved
our
line
over
the
united
states
and
1848
congressional
act
consenting
to
the
extension
of
the
line.
it
also
said
one
half
of
the
sabine
river
from
its
mouth.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
is
our
position
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
longer
any
dispute
in
this
case,
it
is
the
only
proper
way
to
construct
a
lateral
boundary
is
by
use
of
the
so-called
median
principle.
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
west
bank
of
the
river,
that
was
still
a
contended
far
line,
which
it
is
not,
you
simply
step
out
and
adopt
the
same
so-called
shalowitz
(ph)
principle.
really
the
way
a
median
line
is
drawn
as
you
go
out
to
sea
and
you
find
a
place
that
is
close
to
where
you
are
shooting
far.
and
you
shoot
to
the
nearest
point
on
each
shore
that
you
are
nearest
to,
and
that
is
your
beginning
point.
and
you
step
in
on
an
arbitrary
kind
of
ad
hoc
basis
so
that
you
keep
that
line
all
the
way
to
its
connecting
point
where
every
point
on
that
line
is
no
closer
to
one
coast
than
it
is
to
the
other,
and
of
course,
the
obvious
reason
is,
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
equitably
divide
the
seabed,
and
that
is
the
only
kind
of
line
that
does
it.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
but
that
would
not
be
very
much
different,
say
academically
if
that
is
what
we
are
deciding
about
in
this
case,
we
would
not
have
very
much
to
talk
about
it.
because
the
principle
of
the
line
would
be
the
same.
it
would
just
have
a
different
connecting
point
that
some
maybe
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
west
of
it.
but
you
project
the
line
exactly
under
the
same
principles,
that
we
have
spoken
of
as
the
middle
line
back
at
the
time
texas
was
annexed.
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
but
the
only
concept
of
any
of
so-called
middle
line
or
median
line
is
that
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
to
divide
the
path
fairly,
that
is
all
it
is
about.
you
trying
to
go
haywire,
you
are
trying
to
do
equity
to
both
sides.
no
one
denies
that
the
texas
line
shown
on
this
map
does
that,
no
one.
the
line
is
proper,
it
connects
to
our
historic
middle
and
it
divides
it
in
it
an
equitable
way.
when
you
take
the
united
states
line
which
is
now
been
joined
in
by
louisiana,
you
use
the
jetties
which
were
not
developed
on
median
principle
lines
at
all.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
equity
of
dividing
a
seabed,
they
were
built
by
the
united
states
core
of
engineer
for
the
purpose
of
the
united
states
government
in
navigation.
they
do
not
even
purport
to
follow
a
median
line.
and
when
you
move
down
and
start
at
that
position,
you
destroy
the
principles
of
median
principle
because
you
have
such
narrow
baselines.
it
is
meaningless.
if
you
take
two
small
baselines
to
construct
a
median
principle
out
of
that,
you
might
as
well
just
draw
a
straight
line.
it
is
going
to
come
out
substantially
the
same.
so,
unfairness
is
injected
into
this
case
by
the
use
of
man-made
jetties
constructed
by
the
united
states
corps
of
engineers
in
1880
when
they
were
begun
as
to
our
historical
boundary
was
already
recognized,
which
did
equity
to
everyone,
and
now
we
are
put
in
the
position
that
we
are
being
said
that
we
have
given
up
part
of
our
entitlement
because
in
some
way,
we
have
acquiesced,
we
have
acquiesced
says
the
master,
as
his
primary
basis.
the
state
of
texas
is
acquiesced
in
giving
up
this
valuable
land
that
would
be
ours
under
that
principle
because
we
have
acquiesced
in
moving
our
boundary
line
down
the
jetty
to
the
mouth.
how
ridiculous
can
you
get.
it
is
an
aversive
change,
nothing
which
we
participated.
it
was
begun
in
1888,
totally
financed
by
the
united
states
government.
the
only
reason
for
building
it
was,
that
there
were
still
building
up
at
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river
and
placing
a
bar
by
the
navigation
and
it
would
get
it
out
further
into
sea,
the
silt
would
not
impair
navigation.
they
worked
on
it
till
1936,
what
were
we
doing,
acquiescing
every
several
years,
as
they
added
a
little
but
more
on
to
it,
it
is
ridiculous.
we
have
not
consented
the
for
changing
of
our
boundary.
mr.
john
l.
hill
not
necessarily
due
east
justice
blackmun,
because
you
do
not
measure
a
median
line
from
the
channel
of
the
river
and
extend
the
channel
of
the
river
out.
you
use
the
coastline
or
the
baseline,
the
proper
baseline.
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
would
still
go
to
the
--
still
in
establishing
the
middle
line
as
that
river
point,
you
would
establish
it
not
by
reference
to
the
channel
or
the
fallback
so-called
of
the
river,
you
would
establish
the
middle
line
by
reference
to
the
coastal,
the
coastline.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir.
particularly
if
the
coastline
was
more
or
less
regular
and
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
claims
that
louisiana
and
texas
had
a
substantially
irregular
coastline,
as
coastlines
go.
and
what
is
happening
here
is
after
they
cannot
sustain
the
acquiescence
and
prescription
because
the
evidence
is
weak,
the
law
is
weak,
you
do
not
take
something
away
from
someone
on
acquiescence
on
a
small
25
year
period
which
is
all
they
are
talking
about
on
the
basis
that
some
shrimpers
had
given
affidavit
that
they
got
arrested
about
for
fishing
license
in
a
certain
area.
that
is
just
weak
as
water
and
it
would
not
hold,
and
there
is
not
enough
evidence
here,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
if
you
are
going
to
apply
prescription
and
acquiescence
which
you
do
not
even
favor
as
a
rule,
you
are
slow
to
do
it
in
a
boundary
involving
water,
much
slower
than
in
land.
and
i
just
do
not
know
of
a
case
where
you
take
this
kind
of
evidence
that
has
been
presented
here
over
that
short
period
of
time
and
ignore
all
of
the
other
documentation
and
history
and
case
law
here
and
just
overwrite
it
on
some
basis,
that
prescription
we
have
agreed
that
the
mouth
of
that
river
could
be
shifted
down.
now
losing
on
that
point,
we
get
into
a
--
united
states
takes
the
position
and
the
master
agreed
that
since
congress
did
not
more
accurately
delimit
our
lateral
boundary
line
back
in
those
historic
times.
that
it
must
be
discarded
in
favor
of
a
modern
line
which
we
take
into
account
these
modern
jetties.
now,
we
have
said
out
in
our
briefs,
please
remember
that
we
have
a
pre-trial
brief,
a
post-submission
brief,
as
well
as
our
brief
in
support
of
our
exceptions.
all
of
which
we
would
commend
because
we
have
shortened
our
brief
down
on
our
exceptions,
and
some
of
our
evidence
on
this
inchoate
line
principle
are
in
the
previous
briefs.
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
historic
coastline.
mr.
john
l.
hill
in
this
particular
map
it
is
right
here.
it
would
actually
favor
texas
to
use
the
present
modern
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
right
here,
your
honor,
where
these
lines
are.
that
is
the
historic
coastline
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
these
were
results
of
evulsive
changes
that
came
about
by
building
the
jetties.
i
wish
we
could
use
them,
we
would
move
our
line
eastward
if
we
could
but
it
is
wrong,
it
is
legally
wrong
to
use
it.
it
is
not
equity
to
louisiana,
it
is
not
haywire,
it
is
the
wrong
principle.
the
right
principle
is
the
historic
shoreline
because
you
have
already
decreed
it
for
texas,
you
have
already
told
us
that
that
was
the
baseline.
mr.
john
l.
hill
baseline?
mr.
john
l.
hill
right
here,
we
took
these
lines
from
the
decree
that
was
already
placed
in
the?
mr.
john
l.
hill
at
the
eastern,
that
the
mouth
or
head
are
permanent
of
the
eastern
jetty.
mr.
john
l.
hill
down
here.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
the
master?s
baseline
is
all
about
six
miles,
because
the
jetty
comes
out
3.1,
into
the
water,
from
the
natural
mouth.
and
the
reason,
the
basic
fallacy
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
exactly,
he
might
as
well
have
saved
his
time.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
mean
once
he
got
us
out
to
the
end
to
the
end
of
the
jetties,
where
the
jetties
with
which
he
had
such
great
affection,
there
was
no
need.
i
mean
the
median
line
principle
went
out
the
window.
so,
it
was
simply
because,
the
anomaly
here
is
that
you
have
given
louisiana
the
right
to
measure
her
territorial
sea,
the
breadth
of
it
from
the
east
jetty.
but
you
have
not
given
her,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
lateral
boundaries,
that
just
simply
had
to
do
with
your
interpretation
of
the
geneva
convention
that
since
harbor
work
were
part
of
a
coastline
for
purposes
of
delimiting
the
sea
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
1936,
and
we
are
supposed
to
somehow
acquiest
in
these
man-made
evulsive
jetties?
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
about
half
a
mile.
mr.
john
l.
hill
am
i
wrong
in
there,
i
stand
corrected,
i
do
not
know
the
answer.
i
have
seen
them
many
times.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir.
you
see
it
is
a
fallacy.
they
talk
in
terms
of
the
eastern
jetty
being
owned
some
way
by
someone.
no
one
owns
the
eastern
jetty,
it
is
united
states
government.
louisiana
speaks
that
they
own
this
land,
this
seabed
from
the
texas
median
line
to
the
jetty,
not
at
all.
you
have
not
decreed
who
owns
that,
you
have
simply
decreed
how
to
measure
the
territorial
sea.
the
only
thing
that
can
determine
who
owns
it
is
for
you
to
fix
the
lateral
boundary,
that
is
what
is
going
to
determine
who
owns
it.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
question
about
it,
no
question
about
it.
and
they
can
alter
our
boundary,
by
that.county
unilateral
act
that
to
which
we
have
absolutely
--
not
only
not
acquiest
in
1947,
we
established
our
own
statutory
lines
by?
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
am
sorry
i
am
not
catching
your
question?
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
eastern
jetty
attaches
to
the
shoreline
of
louisiana.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no.
the
jetty
belongs
to
the
united
states?
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
do
not
think
it
is.
unless
you
want
to
quibble
about
the?
mr.
john
l.
hill
if
you
want
to
say
that
the
attachment
at
the
shoreline,
that
louisiana
owns
that
shoreline
to
where
it
attaches,
yes.
but
they
do
not
own
the
jetties.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
john
l.
hill
not
any
at
all.
not
any
point
from
there
is
it
in
louisiana,
you
have
not
decreed
the
jetty
or
any
part
of
the
jetty
to
be
owned
by
any
state,
by
either
state,
nor
could
you,
it
is
owned
by
the
unites
states
government,
it
paid
for
it
and
erected
it.
the
only
significance
you
have
ever
attached
to
it
is
you
gave
the
eastern?
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
is
not
located
then
in
louisiana,
it
would
be
located
in
areas
that
are
properly
--
let
us
say
that
over
which
texas
will
properly
have
jurisdiction
when
this
case
enters
the
proper
decree.
when
this
court
entered
the
proper
decree
to
say
that
this
territory
is
within
our
proper
territorial
sea,
then
the
jetty
will
be
in
an
area
over
which
we
properly
and
legally
held
offshore
jurisdiction.
there
is
something
less
than
full
ownership
even
in
that
area
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
first
united
states
versus
california
case.
but
even
when
us
versus
california
was
decided,
you
recognized
that
the
states
had
some
jurisdiction
left,
you
recognized
that
jurisdiction
was
bounded
by
lateral
boundary,
you
said
so
in
the
decree
of
us
versus
california
and
us
versus
texas.
you
can
not
wipe
out
what
has
already
been
done
by
the
court.
thank
you.
