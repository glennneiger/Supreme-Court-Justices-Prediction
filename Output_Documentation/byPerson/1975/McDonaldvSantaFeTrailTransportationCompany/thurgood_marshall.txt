in
the
second
case,
mcdonald
against
the
santa
fe
trail
transportation
company
is
from
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioners
in
this
case,
two
white
employees
of
the
santa
fe
trail
transportation
company
were
fired
after
being
charged
with
involvement
in
the
theft
of
property
entrusted
to
the
company,
but
a
similarly
charged
negro
employee
was
not
fired,
alleging
that
their
firing
was
racially
motivated
and
that
the
union
acquiesced
in
the
racially
discriminating
firing,
petitioners
brought
this
action
in
the
southern
district
of
texas
under
title
7
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
64
and
42
united
states
code,
section
1981.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
on
the
pleadings,
holding
that
1981
does
not
protect
white
persons
from
racial
discrimination
in
private
employment
and
that
petitioners
have
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
under
title
7.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
first,
that
title
7
prohibits
racial
discrimination
in
private
employment
against
white
persons
as
well
as
non-whites.
and
that
the
facts
alleged
by
petitioner
were
adequate
under
mcdonald
douglas
corporation
against
green,
to
state
a
claim
of
such
racial
discrimination.
crime
or
other
misconduct
against
an
employer
may
be
legitimate
basis
for
discharge
but
it
cannot
be
used
as
a
pretext
for
racial
discrimination.
secondly
we
hold
that
1981
also
applies
to
racial
discrimination
in
private
employment
against
white
persons
as
well
as
non-whites.
we
find
this
conclusion
be
required
not
only
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
also
by
the
legislative
history.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
