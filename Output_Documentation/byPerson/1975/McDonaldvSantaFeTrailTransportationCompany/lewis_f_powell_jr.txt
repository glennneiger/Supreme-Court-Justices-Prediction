looking
at
the
paragraph
that
precedes

this
is
paragraph
b
on

that
all
three
of
these

that
with
your
arguments?

would
like
to

a
hypothetical
to
you

in

you

proposition
you

me
say

me
put
this
case.

of
whom
were
negro
and
50
were
whites.
all
100
went
on
a
sit-down
strike
and
undertook
jointly
and
said
that
they
will
break
up
all
the
machinery
in
the
plant.
management
then
said
this
is
a
great
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
all

negro
employees,

management
fired

50
negro
employees,
retained
the
50
white.
is
it
your
position
that
title
vii
would
not
apply?
