mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
here
seek
and
have
sought
redress
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
under
section
1981
of
42
united
states
code,
the
codification
of
the
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
for
private
racial
discrimination
in
employment.
in
all
substantial
respects
there
is
no
particular
difference
in
this
case
than
in
the
legion
numbers
of
cases
that
is
presently
pending
in
the
federal
district
courts
around
the
country
except
that
in
this
case
the
petitioners
who
seek
to
redress
the
grievance
of
private
discrimination
based
on
race
in
their
employment
are
white.
basically,
the
two
petitioners,
mr.
mcdonald
and
mr.
laird
were
accused
by
their
employer
santa
fe
of
misappropriating
company
property.
along
with
them
stood
accused
a
black
co-worker.
as
result
of
the
accusations,
the
two
petitioners
were
discharged,
their
black
co-worker
was
not.
because
disparate
disciplinary
treatment
so
often
smacks
of
illegal
motive
in
a
racial
context,
the
petitioners
concluded
that
they
have
been
discriminated
against
because
of
their
race
and
accordingly
instituted
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
state
--
southern
district
of
texas,
alleging
that
the
race
was
a
factor
in
their
discharge.
more
clearly
stated,
the
petitioners
concluded
and
urge
that,
but
for
the
immutable
characteristic
of
the
color
of
their
skin
that
they
would
have
received
the
favored
treatment
accorded
to
their
black
co-worker.
in
many
respects
this
is
no
different
than
a
fact
situation
recently
before
the
court
in
franks
versus
bowman
where
it
would
be
one
way
of
describing
the
circumstances
in
that
case
would
be
to
say
that
the
black
employees
had
been
excluded
from
the
over
the
road
driving
classification.
another
way
would
have
been
to
say
that
the
white
employees
of
bowman
transportation
were
accorded
the
preference
and
this
is
precisely
and
only
what
these
petitioners
have
alleged.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
cause
of
action,
stating
that
a
white
employee
charged
with
misappropriating
company
property
and
dismissed
cannot
complain
of
racial
discrimination
where
a
similarly
charged
black
employee
is
not
dismissed.
it
also
dismissed,
stating
that
section
1981
confers
no
actionable
rights
upon
a
white
person.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed,
adopting
an
apparent
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
petitioners
had
failed
to
deny
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
of
the
misappropriation
on
their
complaint.
none
of
the
respondents
--
neither
of
the
respondents
and
none
of
the
amicus
have
seriously
disputed
that
title
vii
embraces
by
its
language,
discrimination
against
white
persons.
this
is
supported
by
all
of
the
many
of
the
eeoc
decisions
which
are
entitled
the
great
deference
as
the
body
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
act.
it
is
supported
by
the
language
in
griggs
v.
duke
power
company
wherein
the
court
stated
that
preferences,
whether
for
majority
or
minority
are
all
the
congress
intended
to
prescribe
and
it
is
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
assuming
then
that
title
vii
may
be
invoked
by
white
persons,
we
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
these
petitioners
have
stated
the
claim
under
which
relief
can
be
granted.
for
the
purposes
of
this
consideration,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
court
consider
the
color
of
the
petitioner’s
skin,
but
only
whether
racial
motivation
was
a
factor
or
race
was
a
factor
in
the
framework
of
section
703
(a)
(1)
in
their
discharge
or
in
the
discipline
accorded
them.
that
of
course
is
the
gravamen
of
any
title
vii
or
section
1981
employment
discrimination
complaint.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
well,
the
gravamen
of
racial
disparity
would
not
be
present
so,
if
their
were
disparate
--
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
i
have
thought
about
a
lot
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
could
have
been,
no
sir.
we
do
not
--
it
is
important
that
we
point
out,
we
do
not
urge
that
any
employer
is
without
the
right
to
discipline
within
his
discretion,
those
who
commit
unlawful
acts
and
those
who
commit
wrongdoings
within
the
employment
of
their
employer.
however,
what
we
do
urge
is
that
when
an
employer
discharges
employees
for
such
wrongdoings
that
the
criteria
for
such
discharges
must
be
evenly
applied.
that
is
not
to
say
that
you
cannot
discipline
a
black
person
differently
than
a
white
person.
it
is
to
say
that
the
reason
for
the
different
discipline
cannot
be
founded
or
even
touched
by
a
racial
factor.
there
maybe
no
racial
motivation
between
the
difference
in
discipline
accorded
to
the
different
races.
in
any
event
the
petitioners
did
allege
that
the
difference
in
discipline
accorded
them
was
because
of
their
race
and
we
are
told
in
mcdonnell
douglas
versus
green
as
well
as
other
cases
that
an
injured
party,
black
or
white
will
make
such
an
allegation
has
stated
the
claim
under
title
vii.
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
are
accused
of
a
theft
should
be
no
impediment
to
such
a
holding.
clearly
there
was
no
impediment
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green
case
where
the
--
was
the
respondent
in
that
case
mr.
green
was
a
convicted
misdemeanant
and
here
all
we
have
is
mere
allegations
of
a
wrongdoing.
the
fifth
circuit
seem
to
bottom
its
affirmation
on
the
fact
that
the
district
court
had
observed
that
the
petitioners
had
not
denied
in
their
complaint
that
they
were
guilty
of
misappropriation
as
alleged.
it
appears
to
me
to
be
a
fundamental
error
in
the
proposition
that
the
fifth
circuit
bottomed
its
decision
on
and
that
is
for
one
the
petition
on
its
face
says
that
the
petitioners
were
discharged
without
cause,
and
therefore,
whatever
reasons
were
ascribed,
even
though
they
suggest
they
were
protectoral
reasons,
but
whatever
the
reason
that
had
been
advanced
is
denied
by
the
pleading.
secondly,
in
assuming
arguendo
that
they
had
failed
to
deny
the
truth
of
the
allegation
or
the
reason
advanced
for
the
discharge
on
their
complaint,
it
really
would
make
no
difference
at
all.
the
petitioners
alleged
and
the
district
court
considered
in
dismissing,
pursuant
to
rule
12
(b)
(6)
that
the
three
parties,
that
is
the
two
petitioners
and
mr.
jackson,
their
black
co-worker
were
equally
charged
and
equally
culpable
when
it
dismissed
the
decision,
the
petition.
the
court
has
again
reiterated
in
a
recent
decision,
treating
and
touching
on
this
case
that
given
the
same
opportunity,
it
would
hold
the
same
way
that
the
failure
to
deny
the
allegations
of
misappropriation
take
a
complainant,
black
or
white,
out
of
the
embrace
of
title
vii
and
we
submit
that
is
simply
wrong.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
well,
not
precisely,
but
it
is
analogous.
the
argument
of
the
persons
receiving
the
more
severe
punishment
would
be
that,
were
i
of
a
different
color,
i
would
be
getting
to
preferred
or
shorter
sentence
and
no,
to
the
second
part
of
your
question,
these
were
simply
mere
bare
bones
allegations.
yes
sir,
--
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
it
was
--
well,
no.
there
was
non-advanced
by
the
company
in
the
sense
that
perhaps
the
employee
had
--
well
no
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
well,
in
this
particular
instance,
it
was
a
dismissal
under
rule
12
(b)
(6),
there
was
never
any
testimony
taken.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
and
race
was
not
advanced
as
a
reason
for
the
discharge.
it
was
simply
that
they
had
not
been
accorded
to
preferred
treatment
or
alternatively
they
have
been
treated
differently
and
because
of
the
disparate
treatment
they
could
only
conclude
that
race
was
a
factor
and
that
is
impermissible
under
703
(a)
(1).
they
were
entitled
to
make
that
showing.
they
were,
for
example
in
mcdonnell
douglas
this
court
carefully
articulated
the
proper
allocations
and
burdens
of
proof.
had
the
case
not
been
dismissed
pursuant
to
rule
12
(b)
(6),
petitioners
would
have
gone
forward
with
their
proof
that
they
were
discharged
and
their
similarly
situated
black
employee
was
not
discharged,
then
the
company
would
properly
have
advanced,
they
stole,
for
example,
and
the
burden
would
then
and
this
is
where
the
court
took
the
next
step
in
mcdonnell
douglas
would
allow
the
petitioners
to
show
that
for
example
in
this
case
the
reason
for
the
discharge
advanced
was
protectoral
and
the
cover
up
and
to
a
preferred
treatment
which
is
violative
of
703
(j)
and
prohibited
significant
to
that
type
of
showing
would
be
that
the
black
was
equally
culpable,
that
the
company
knew
of
the
equal
culpability
and
retained
the
black
employee
while
discharging
the
white.
that
the
book
--
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
i
can
answer
that
question
for
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
on
page
94
of
the
appendix,
the
court
says,
“i
am
considering
these
men
equally
charged
and
equally
culpable
and
i
am
dismissing.”
there
may
well
be
ameliorating
circumstances,
but
not
in
the
court's
eye.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
that
--
if
well,
yes.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
it
would
be
a
matter
of
the
mind
--
of
what
was
in
the
mind
the
person
discharging
them
and
whether
race
was
a
factor
in
the
decision
not
to
discharge.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
well,
it
never
became
--
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
i
understand.
there
never
was
a
criterion
in
this
case.
in
any
event
we
submit
that
discrimination,
this
discrimination
did
not
occur
against
a
backdrop
of
a
pattern
of
discrimination
work
for
hundreds
of
years
against
white
persons.
we
do
submit
that
the
racial
preference
granted
in
this
case,
a
minority
violates
the
standards
set
down
in
griggs
versus
duke
power
and
we
further
submit
that
the
allegation
of
theft
is
no
impediment
to
the
entitlement
of
the
petitioners
to
make
their
proof.
we
then
turn
to
an
inquiry
regarding
section
1981.
we
may
not
stop
with
title
vii
because
quite
candidly
the
petitioners
in
this
instance
may
have
a
timely
filing
problem
under
title
vii.
they
do
not
have
a
problem
in
the
fifth
circuit,
but
we
are
advised
of
the
guy
versus
robinson
mayer
decision
in
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
presently
pending
on
petition
in
this
court.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
mr.
chief
justice,
he
was
addressing
it
to
counsel,
i
assumed
for
both
sides.
i
did
not
represent
the
petitioner
in
the
lower
courts,
the
petitioners.
there
was
not
adequate
briefing,
but
it
was
asked
to
both
parties
by
my
recollection
of
the
reading
of
the
record.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
i
would
think
so
and
it
would
be
--
it
would
make
the
prima
facieness
of
our
case
until
such
time
as,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
company
came
forward
and
showed
that
there
might
be
differences
that
one
person,
that
the
black
man
had
stolen
$1.24
and
the
white
petitioners
had
stolen
a
million
dollars
worth
of
goods.
but
the
petition
was
dismissed
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
equally
charged
and
equally
culpable
and
had
similar
work
records
which
is
precisely
what
caused
the
petitioners
to
conclude
that
race
was
a
factor
in
their
discharge.
in
any
event,
if
i
may,
with
regard
to
section
1981
because
it
maybe
very
vital
to
these
petitioners
if
remand
occurred,
we
would
ask
of
the
court
to
consider
the
briefs
and
the
amicus
which
have
abundantly
demonstrated
that
the
legislative
history,
if
not
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
itself,
thus
indeed
embrace
white
persons.
the
problem
producing
language
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens,
we
submit
and
we
believe
have
adequately
addressed,
is
a
quantitative
yardstick
by
which
the
rights
of
all
citizens
must
be
measured.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
ambiguous.
in
addition,
the
legislative
history,
if
the
court
felt
it
was
ambiguous,
plainly
supports
the
propositions
that
we
advance
that
white
persons
may
state
a
claim
under
section
1981.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
it
was
under
the
power
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
but
re-codified
subsequent,
two
years
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
must
reflect
their
thinking
of
the
quality
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
remain
constitutional,
to
give
it
an
all
black
construction
makes
it
fly
in
the
face
in
my
opinion.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
well,
and
also
the
protection
of
the
abolitionist
who
were
suffering
at
the
hands
of
their
anti-abolitionist
white
neighbors
were
directly
spoken
to
and
protected
by
the
thirteenth
amendment
in
its
history.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
that
it
would
be
misconstrued.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
i
could
not
agree
more
and
to
give
it
in
all
black
construction
flies
in
the
face
of
fourteenth
amendment.
my
time
is
running
short
and
i
am
trying
to
reserve
some
of
it.
i
can
see
or
fathom
no
compelling
state
or
governmental,
in
this
case,
interest
in
giving
a
construction
to
section
1981
that
would
exclude
white
persons.
beyond
that
i
would
ask
the
court
not
be
troubled
by
the
absence
of
a
background
of
racial
discrimination
against
whites.
it
is
perhaps
too
a
simple
statement
to
make,
but
simply
true
that
had
the
petitioners
here
had
been
black,
neither
of
the
lower
c
courts
would
have
had
any
trouble
finding
a
cause
of
action.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
first,
i
would
like
to
make
the
observation
that
the
petitioners
have
simply
never
been
convicted
of
any
crime,
theft
or
otherwise.
there
has
been
an
allegation
that
there
were
26
cans
of
anti
freeze
misappropriated
and
i
remind
the
court
that
in
the
mcdonnell
case,
the
green,
we
had
a
convicted
confessed
misdemeanant,
so
i
simply
reject
mr.
dixie’s
proposition
plus
if
we
talk
of
flood
gates
then
a
criteria
is
created
where
the
mere
allegation
of
wrongdoing
constitutes
the
basis
for
discharge
without
the
embrace
of
title
vii
or
1981,
it
is
likely
the
10
years
of
ameliorating
judicial
interpretation
of
title
vii
will
go
out
the
window.
this
is
precisely
what
happened
in
the
hundreds
of
cases
upon
which
title
vii
claims
were
based.
mr.
dixie
asks
for
reasons
why
we
should
have
1981
and
why
we
should
only
worry
about
two
people
here.
one
of
the
reasons
is
precisely
that
these
petitioners
and
in
particular
mr.
laird,
he
never
filed
a
title
vii
charge
at
the
eeoc,
so
it
is
all
together
possible
depending
on
constructions
placed
on
his
failure
to
file
that
1981
is
his
only
avenue
of
relief.
furthermore,
many
hypotheticals
have
been
tossed
around.
if
it
turned
out
for
example
that
this
employer
had
less
than
15
employees,
1981
is
a
necessary
vehicle
for
redeeming
discrimination
if
it
occurs
whether
preferences
are
for
the
majority
or
minority.
we
have
heard
much
of
the
legislative
history.
i
do
not
intend
to
burden
the
court
overly,
but
i
cannot
resist
reading
from
the
brief
of
the
respondent
prepared
by
me.
mr.
henry
m.
rosenblum
thank
you.
