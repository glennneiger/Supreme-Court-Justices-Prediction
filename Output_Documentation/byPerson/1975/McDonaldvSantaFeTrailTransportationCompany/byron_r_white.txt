justice

are
you
defending
the
right

justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
the
--
you
disown
the

justice

what
would
you
say
if
an
employer
found
his
business
falling
off,
he
did
not
have
any
–
he
was
not
presented
–
he
did
not
–
he
was
not
organized
and
he
is
going
to
have
to
cut
down
10
employees
and
he
discharged
10
white
employees
and
they
brought
a
suit
alleging
that
they
were
discharged
because
of
their
race?
justice

what
about
1981?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
agree
that
both
titles,
at
least
title
vii
protects
the
whites
as
well
as
the
black?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
black
were
the
plaintiff
here
making
the
same
allegations
as
the
white
person
is
making
here,
you
would
be
arguing
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
are
you
going
to
1981?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
decide
that
white
citizens
generally
have
a
certain
right
and
then
a
certain
white
citizen
is
denied
it,
why
does
he
not
have
a
cause
of
action?
