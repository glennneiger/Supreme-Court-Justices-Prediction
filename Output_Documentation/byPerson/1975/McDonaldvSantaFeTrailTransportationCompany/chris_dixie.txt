mr.
chris
dixie
if
the
court
please,
both
lower
courts
assumed
that
the
two
people
--
the
three
people
who
were
guilty
of
theft
and
he
had
gone
into
various
allegations
in
pretrial
hearings
and
it
was
before
the
district
court
that
the
theft
concerned
60
cases
of
anti-freeze
then
in
transit
in
the
possession
of
a
common
carrier,
that
is
a
crime
under
state
law
of
felony
and
it
is
also
a
crime
under
federal
law.
both
courts
held
that
if
it
is
serious
crime
it
is
outside
of
the
purview
of
title
vii.
i
would
like
to
refer
this
court
to
a
line
of
cases
by
the
lower
courts
that
hold
that
the
under
national
labor
relations
act
if
serious
theft
on
the
job
is
involved,
the
entire
case
is
outside
of
the
purview
even
if
the
discharge
was
motivated
by
prohibited
reasons.
please
see
nlrb
vs.
magnuson,
523
federal
second
643
which
collates
the
decisions
seven
circuits
to
the
same
effect.
i
mention
this
point
because
in
one
if
the
briefs,
that
is
the
rejected
brief,
the
point
is
made
that
you
do
the
same
thing
under
this
statute
that
we
do
under
the
labor
act
because
it
was
model
for
this
statute,
title
vii
and
i
want
the
court
to
please
examine
this
line
of
cases.
the
theory
of
the
lower
courts
is
that
when
you
get
down
to
the
question
of
serious
theft
on
the
job,
it
does
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
it
also
demeans
the
court
to
reinstate
and
provide
back
pay
for
someone
who
is
demonstrated
to
be
guilty
of
that
kind
of
conduct.
so
here
the
court
must
decide,
i
think
whether
in
your
judgment
it
is
necessary
to
provide
equality
in
punishment
for
serious
theft
on
the
job
as
a
means
of
defective
enforcement
of
title
vii
or
whether
as
was
done
under
the
labor
act,
you
leave
theft
outside
the
purview
of
the
statute.
now,
that
is
what
this
court
did
in
the
ancient
case
of
fansteel
which
was
cited
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
versus
green.
in
fansteel,
the
sit-down
strikers
were
not
reinstated,
even
though
mini
sit-down
strikers
were
reinstated.
the
supreme
court
said
that
kind
of
conduct
puts
them
beyond
the
purview
of
the
statute
and
that
is
what
we
think
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
under
1981,
we
joined
issue
with
the
other
parties.
we
say
that
the
face
of
the
statute
does
not
accommodate
this
case.
mr.
chris
dixie
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
have
an
ideal
cause
of
action.
no
one
has
disputed
in
this
case
that
title
vii
applies
and
protects
to
white
people.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
does.
white
people
can
file
charges
before
eeoc.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
get
to.
i
might
say
that
white
people
can
even
intervene
in
appending
proceeding
under
title
vii
in
federal
court.
mr.
chris
dixie
right.
i
am
not
only
agreeing
to
it,
but
i
protest
in
the
implication
to
the
contrary
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
chris
dixie
certainly.
all
races,
colors,
national
origins,
religions
and
sexes
have
a
cause
of
action
under
title
vii
and
in
case
there
is
a
misunderstanding
in
the
public
and
i
think
there
may
be,
this
seems
to
be
an
ideal
occasion
for
the
court
to
speak
loud
and
clear
on
that
subject.
i
must
say
to
you
that
a
lot
of
misfortune
has
been
visited
upon
white
workers
under
title
vii
without
their
presence
before
the
court.
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that,
but
the
remedy
for
that
is
not
to
stretch
1981.
it
is
to
point
out
the
fact
that
they
have
ideal
protection
under
title
vii
in
the
same
forum
and
under
the
same
substantive
and
procedural
rules.
please
let
me
go
to
19
--
mr.
chris
dixie
right
now.
your
honor
the
1886
act
as
it
was
passed
provided,
first,
all
persons
born
here
are
citizens
and
second
all
citizens
shall
posses
certain
rights
to
the
same
degree
as
white
citizens.
now,
is
it
not
interesting
that
no
one
on
the
other
side,
no
brief
comes
to
grip
with
that
phrase
the
same
rights
as
are
enjoyed
by
white
citizens.
now,
in
making
that
language,
congress
thus
established
the
rights
possessed
by
white
citizens
as
the
yardstick
for
measuring
the
rights
of
all
citizens.
and
this
case
does
not
fit
the
statute
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
require
the
court
to
say
now
that
we
are
going
to
take
the
yardstick
of
black
citizens
in
a
single
isolated
episode
of
theft
to
provide
a
converse
or
reciprocal
cause
of
action
for
white
people.
now,
the
legislative
history
does
not
require
that
or
does
not
even
permit
it
as
we
see
it.
now,
do
not
confuse
jones
versus
alfred
mayer.
in
that
case
the
face
of
the
statute
supported
the
plaintiffs
and
the
inquiry
of
the
court
was
whether
there
was
something
in
the
legislative
history
that
required
the
court
to
go
contrary
to
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
in
this
case
the
face
of
the
statute
supports
the
respondent
and
the
burden
is
heavier.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
i
think
all
persons
--
mr.
chris
dixie
all
persons,
yes.
i
really
think
so.
mr.
chris
dixie
i
think
that
is
right
and
the
statute
even
covers
white
aliens
because
alien
which
is
a
disability
that
congress
wanted
to
overcome,
but
the
ultimate
thing
we
must
get
to
in
this
case
if
we
are
going
to
be
true
to
what
that
reconstruction
congress
enacted
is
the
adoption
of
a
yardstick
of
white
citizens'
rights
whatever
they
are
and
the
granting
of
those
rights
to
all
citizens
and
that
is
the
place
where
the
statute
does
not
fit
the
case
and
vice
versa.
mr.
chris
dixie
they
are
not
asking
for
the
rights
of
white
citizens
in
this
case.
they
would
have
such
an
insurmountable
burden
of
proof
there
that
it
would
be
futile
to
file
such
a
case.
while
these
plaintiffs
are
not
asking
for
the
rights
of
white
citizens,
these
plaintiffs
are
asking
for
the
rights
of
black
citizens
and
they
are
asking
the
court
to
perform
plastic
surgery
upon
the
statute
and
do
something
that
the
reconstruction
congress
did
not
do
and
they
ask
this
they
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
that
is
not
what
is
involved
here
your
honor.
in
the
post
slavery
period,
in
the
implementation
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
congress
was
interested
in
elevating
and
protecting
the
position
of
freedmen.
they
were
not
interested
in
protecting
the
rights
of
white
people.
it
is
not
incumbent
on
congress
to
come
up
with
a
solution
that
is
perfectly
rectangular
or
perfectly
square
in
every
situation.
the
congress
may
address
itself
to
the
evil
at
hand
and
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
cite
williamson
versus
lee
optical
company,
the
1955
term
of
court,
348
u.s.
483
which
collated
all
the
cases
up
to
that
time
and
has
been
cited
many
times
by
this
court
for
the
proposition
that
congress
may
address
itself
to
the
evil
that
it
perceives
and
that
congress
understood
that
the
white
population
had
their
feet
on
the
necks
of
the
black
population
and
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
to
elevate
all
non-whites,
if
you
please,
to
the
status
of
whites
in
each
state,
whatever
that
status
was.
and
so
in
asking
for
this
plastic
surgery,
they
do
not
give,
they
do
not
reach,
i
do
not
believe
the
legislative
history,
but
i
am
not
going
to
burden
you
with
that
except
to
say
to
your
honors
that
the
legislative
history
after
the
bill
took
its
final
form,
not
the
early
stages
of
it,
made
a
clear
demonstration
that
the
senators
and
the
congressmen
understood
the
structure
and
thrust
of
this
statute
is
to
provide
relief
for
the
freedmen
and
to
deprived
people
and
elevate
them
to
the
level
of
white
citizens.
they
understood
that
and
they
articulated
that.
president
johnson
said
that
in
his
veto
message
and
senator
trumbull,
the
principal
sponsor
of
the
bill
said
that,
after
president
johnson
vetoed.
president
johnson
said
this
thing
is
discriminatory.
senator
trumbull
said
with
what
truth
can
this
be
said
of
a
bill
which
declares
that
the
civil
rights
and
punishments
of
all
races,
including
of
course
the
colored
shall
be
the
same
as
those
of
the
white
persons.
he
did
not
say
that
this
gives
a
cause
of
action
to
white
people
too.
now,
the
last
thing
i
want
to
say
that
the
court
because
and
i
have
observed
(voice
overlap).
mr.
chris
dixie
no,
that
is
not
my
position
because
there
are
lots
of
white
people
as
we
speak.
white
people
under
the
statute
mean
something
else.
for
example,
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
mexican-americans
can
reach
under
this
statute.
there
is
a
very,
very
lengthy
law
review
article
in
63,
colorado
--
california
law
review
demonstrating
why
they
are
an
unidentifiable
ethnic
group.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
can
who
ever
make
out
a
claim
your
honor?
mr.
chris
dixie
a
straight
caucasian,
well,
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
a
straight
caucasian
is,
but
i
believe
that
theoretically
he
could.
i
just
believe
he
would
have
a
terrible
burden
of
proof
at
that
question
while
theoretically
penetrating
is
not
a
very
serious
practical
problem
your
honor,
but
there
are
other
groups
who
are
put
upon
in
this
nation
who
could
possibly
invoke
the
rights
of
non-whites
,but
in
every
case
they
must
reach
for
the
yardstick
of
white
people.
now,
no
one
in
this
case
has
given
the
court
any
reason
why
you
should
perform
this
plastic
surgery.
title
vii
is
entirely
adequate
in
the
employment
field.
no
one
has
said
what
is
the
use
of
doing
this,
except
the
brief
filed
by
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
and
upon
my
word
they
say
right
in
there
what
we
are
worried
about
and
that
is
that
this
kind
of
a
cause
of
action
invested
in
white
persons
under
1981
becomes
a
useful
tool
to
contest
against
affirmative
action
programs
which
might
be
undertaken
in
the
implementation
of
title
vii
and
if
that
red
light
does
not
go
on,
i
will
give
you
an
illustration.
in
griggs
versus
duke
power
company
this
court
held
that
tests
which
disproportionedally
effect
affect
black
people,
are
not
lawful
unless
they
are
job
related.
but
if
they
are
job
related
the
test
can
be
as
difficult.
i
mean
if
they
do
not
disproportion
--
yes
if
they
are
job
related
they
can
be
as
difficult
as
they
need
to
be.
let
us
suppose
an
employer
determines
that
his
tests
are
not
lawful
and
it
gets
rid
of
him,
he
transfers
blacks
to
other
departments
,he
gives
some
plant-wide
seniority
for
a
remedial
purpose
and
he
has
complied
with
title
vii.
what
stops
a
white
worker
from
suing
under
1981
to
say
that
they
have
applied
a
different
standard
to
a
black
than
they
do
to
me?
that
black
did
not
have
to
pass
that
test.
that
black
now
has
plant-wide
seniority
and
i
have
been
fighting
for
20
years
to
get
plant-wide
seniority.
mr.
chris
dixie
certainly,
but
if
he
wants
to
--
mr.
chris
dixie
if
he
wants
to
stay
away
from
the
equity
court
and
if
he
wants
to
invoke
a
jury,
he
will
sue
under
1981
and
he
will
present
issues
of
fact
for
the
determination
of
a
jury
in
a
different
forum
under
a
different
statute
of
limitations
your
honor
and
have
jury
pass
upon
whether
or
not
that
test
which
was
discarded
by
the
employer
was
in
fact
job
related
or
not
job
related.
well,
my
time
is
up.
in
other
words,
it
may
be
appealing
to
perform
this
plastic
surgery,
but
it
might
lead
to
trouble.
i
think
it
will
and
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
that.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes
your
honor.
mr.
chris
dixie
on
the
job?
mr.
chris
dixie
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
and
your
honor
cited
defense
to
your
case
no
matter
picked
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
where
the
lower
courts
got
it.
mr.
chris
dixie
no.
i
really
believe
that
that
practice
would
be
wide
spread
enough
to
where
a
court
would
have
to
make
a
further
choice,
but
this
is
an
isolated
case
of
a
single
theft.
this
is
one
stealing
of
60
cases
of
heavy
freeze.
the
chief
justice
asked
the
question
earlier
your
honor,
would
be
people
in
the
penitentiary
be
able
to
complain
that
habitually
whites
get
shorter
sentences
than
blacks.
i
think
that
they
really
should
be
allow
that,
but
this
is
not
a
case
of
habitually
complain
of
habitual
practice.
this
is
an
isolated
case
and
--
mr.
chris
dixie
absolutely
not
your
honor.
mr.
chris
dixie
why
of
course,
a
crime
committed
on
the
job
is
a
sui
generis
situation.
that
is
not
a
part
of
condition
of
employment
to
be
able
to
demand
an
equal
punishment
after
you
have
stolen
seriously
from
the
employer,
my
position
is
limited
and
so
are
the
authorities
are
cited,
then
limited
to
the
question
of
serious
crime.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
right,
serious
crime
and
i
do
not
think
you
are
going
to
damage
title
vii
by
accepting
that.
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
think
you
are
going
to
help
either
title
vii
or
the
deprived
races
by
getting
the
courts
into
the
question
of
adjudicating
individual
punishments
without
any
pattern
or
practice
conduct,
individual
punishment
for
serious
crime.
thank
you.
