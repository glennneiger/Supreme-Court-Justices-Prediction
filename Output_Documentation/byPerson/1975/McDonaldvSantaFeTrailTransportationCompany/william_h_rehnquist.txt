justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question
mr.
niebank,
if
i
may,
about
the
paragraph
of
the
complaint
that
justice
stevens
just
asked
you
about.
supposing
that
the
employer
has
a
policy
that
anybody
it
believes
to
be
guilty
of
a
felony
is
to
be
fired
and
it
concludes
with
respect
to
these
three
employees
that
the
two
whites
were
guilty
of
first
degree
burglary
and
the
black
was
guilty
of
second
degree
burglary,
but
decides
that
because
the
black
is
a
black,
we
would
not
fire
him.
now,
they
are
not
equally
culpable
and
yet
that
is
a
decision
based
on
race,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
are
pleading
under
the
federal
rules,
mr.
niebank,
not
under
cheddies
(ph)
rules?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dixie,
is
it
your
submission
that
no
white
person
can
make
out
a
cause
of
action
under
this
section
even
though
he
asserts
he
was
denied
the
rights
accorded
to
white
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
straight
caucasian?
can
he
ever
make
out
a
claim
simply
showing
that
he
is
not
being
given
the
rights
that
“white
people
are
being
given?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
straight
caucasian
or
not
so
straight
caucasian?[laughter]
