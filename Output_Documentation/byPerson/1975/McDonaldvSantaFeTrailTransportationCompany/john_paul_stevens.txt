mr.
niebank,
is
that
a
fair
reading
if
they
allege
in
words,
the
defendant
imposed
the
more
severe
disciplinary
sanction
against
them
because
of
their
race?
caucasian
then
against
their
negro
counterpart,
is
it
not
a
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
they
were
not
precisely
equally
culpable,
would
in
not
still
state
a
cause
of
action
at
least
under
classic
terms,
if
they
allege
that
race
was
a
factor
in
the
decision
and
they
do
allege
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
essential
ingredient
of
a
cause
of
action
that
they
really
like,
i
say
is
equal
culpability
an
essential
ingredient
to
the
cause
of
action
or
is
it
merely
enough
to
allege
that
race
was
a
factor
in
the
discharge
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
that
does
not
answer
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dixie,
can
i
test
that
proposition
with
you
sir?
supposing
a
community
had
an
ordinance.
it
said
white
citizen
shall
be
permitted
to
ride
in
the
front
of
the
bus,
black
citizens
shall
not
be
permitted
to
ride
in
the
front
of
the
bus
and
neither
shall
people
named
dixie.
now
would
mr.
dixie
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
he
was
white?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
would
be
conceivable
for
a
white
person
to
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
right
mr.
dixie
involved
here
is
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
on
account
of
race
which
most
whites
had
in
1866,
but
maybe
some
whites
do
not
have?
