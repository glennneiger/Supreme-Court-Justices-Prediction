chief
justice
warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-260
mcdonald
against
santa
fe.
mr.
rosenblum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
point
of
view
is
this
something
like
prisoners
who
are
all
in
the
same
prison,
but
people
of
one
race
complaining
that
they
were
habitually
given
sentences
twice
as
long
as
the
other
on
the
count
of
race,
where
there
is
no
argument
about
the
fact
that
they
belong
in
confinement,
but
they
have
received
disparate
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
the
guilt
of
the
innocents
from
your
point
of
view
does
not
enter
into
this
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
now,
what
the
district
judge
said
at
page
94
to
which
you
refer
to
is,
in
parenthesis
he
wrote,
(this
court
assumes
for
purposes
for
present
purposes
that
the
negro
employee
had
a
similar
work
record
and
a
similar
degree
of
culpability
in
the
offense)
and
then
he
goes
on,
this
point
has
received
inadequate
attention
in
the
pleadings
filed
by
the
parties
and
has
not
been
briefed
to
whom
is
the
judge
directing
that
observation,
to
your
pleadings
and
brief
or
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
clearly
statements
that
he
is
proceeding
on
an
assumption
that
they
were
equally
culpable
and
by
implication,
at
least
quite
clear
implication
that
there
are
no
extenuating
circumstances
for
one
or
the
other
would
appear
to
make
the
briefing,
the
lack
of
adequate
briefing
irrelevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
rosenblum.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
niebank.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
district
judge
read
it
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
you
make
that
wash,
you
have
got
to
say
this
does
not
allege
a
racial
discriminatory
motivation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
reference
there
was
to
this
complaint
that
you
have
been
reading
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
we
have
to
read
the
complaint
and
determine
whether
that
is
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
most
favorably
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
suggest
as
a
hypothesis
that
they
needed
to
allege
here
to
survive
the
motion
which
is
not
alleged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
surely
can
you
not
read
this
complaint
fairly
as
stating
they
engaged
in
a
giant
enterprise
as
mr.
justice
powell
has
just
pointed
out,
that
they
all
did
the
same
thing
(voice
overlap)
in
detail.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
only
in
the
allegation
stages
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
is
it
not?
the
issue
is
joined
and
you
are
ready
to
go
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
niebank.
mr.
dixie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rosenblum
you
have
anything
that
you
left?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright
we
will
read
it.
your
time
is
up
now
thank
you
mister
rosenblum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
