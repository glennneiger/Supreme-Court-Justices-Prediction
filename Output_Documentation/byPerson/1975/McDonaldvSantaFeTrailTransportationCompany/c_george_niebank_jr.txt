mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
case
has
proceeded
from
the
district
court
through
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court,
it
has
taken
on
a
false,
we
believe,
factual
facade.
as
you
have
heard
the
way
it
is
presented
to
you
is
that
there
were
two
whites
and
a
black
who
were
similarly
situated.
they
talk
about
equally
culpable.
i
invite
your
attention
if
i
may
to
page
38
of
the
printed
appendix
which
includes
paragraph
six
of
the
second
amended
complaint
filed
by
the
petitioners
in
the
district
court.
you
will
notice
there
that
the
petitioners
allege
that
there
was
an
investigation.
they
next
go
on
to
allege
that
as
a
result
of
that
investigation,
they
were
discharged,
but
their
black
co-worker,
mr.
jackson
was
not.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
complain
and
after
all
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
this
was
the
complaint
which
was
dismissed,
that
complaint
does
not
allege
that
these
three
men
were
similarly
situated.
it
does
not
allege
that
they
were
equally
culpable.
as
a
consequence,
it
does
no
more
than
draw
a
conclusion
that
as
a
result
of
an
investigation,
they
were
discharged
and
the
black
man
was
not,
but
we
have
not
the
slightest
knowledge
based
on
this
complaint.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
that
is
a
conclusion,
but
you
do
not
know,
they
do
not
allege
sir
that
jackson,
the
black
man
was
equally
culpable
and
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
they
allege
that,
but
they
do
not
--
the
case
as
been
presented
is
that
they
were
equally
culpable
and
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
well,
the
way
the
case
has
been
presented
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
well,
yes.
the
--
is
equally
culpable
important
or
essential,
i
believe
it
probably
is.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
he
assumed
that,
as
your
honor
was
talking
with
mr.
rosenblum,
you
read
that
portion
of
what
he
assumed
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
were
equally
culpable.
now,
what
i
am
suggesting
here
this
afternoon
is
that
that
is
the
beginning
of
where
this
case
started
to
acquire
this
mistaken
factual
veneer
that
there
was
in
fact
discrimination.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
yes.
(voice
overlap)
well,
i
am
defending
the
result
mr.
justice.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
i
will
go
on
to
that
in
a
moment.
i
am
saying
that
there
was
this
--
there
is
this
disparity
between
the
way
the
case
is
presented
in
the
way
it
was
actually
pleaded.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
it
is
a
certainly
a
decision
affected
by
race
and
as
i
get
to
in
a
moment,
we
will
would
turn
to
it
right
now.
the
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
but
the
unspoken
conclusion
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
the
unspoken
conclusion
is
that
there
were
all
three
found
guilty
and
in
a
fact
that
is
not
alleged,
but
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
that
is
what
they
alleged,
yes.
now,
as
was
averted
to
earlier
in
a
subsequent
case
judge
beau
(ph)
had
an
occasion
to
comment
on
his
decision
in
mcdonald
and
laird,
in
spiess
v.
c.
itoh
&
company
was
decided
on
the
29th
of
january
and
in
that
case
he
is
talking
about
laird
and
mcdonald.
he
said
in
that
case
this
court
could
find
no
allegation
of
racial
discrimination
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
now,
that
is
(inaudible).
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
well,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
this
complaint
was
granted,
i
think
it
is
incumbent
on
this
court
to
take
a
look
at
the
complaint.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
construed
most
favorably
to
the
petitioners,
correct.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
well,
i
believe
they
should
have
or
should
be
required
to
allege
that
they
were
equally
culpable
and
this
is
an
order
to
sustain
the
conclusion
that
there
was
desperate
disciplinary
treatment.
that
they
were
--
the
black
man
was
just
a
guilty
as
they
were,
but
he
was
not
fired
and
they
were.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
well,
the
fact
(voice
overlap)
the
point
that
came
up
before
was
that
they
were
charged
jointly
with
this
theft.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
that
is
the
point
at
which
they
have
got
to
file
a
complaint
which
states
a
cause
of
action
and
the
courts
below
found
that
they
did
not
and
i
think
properly
so.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice,
but
still
given
notice
to
pleading
we
are
entitled
i
believe
to
a
more
specificity
than
they
have
here.
if
however,
you
go
ahead
and
assume
as
the
district
court
did
that
they
were
in
fact
similarly
situated,
still
we
believe
that
the
court
properly
dismissed
the
claim
for
failure
to
state
--
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
under
title
vii
because
and
here
i
would
refer
the
court
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
could
not
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
did.
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
now
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint,
no
we
said
that
we
denied
that
jackson
was
even
charged
like
we
denied
that
laird
was
discharged
for
his
participation
in
the
theft.
we
said
in
our
answer
that
he
was
discharged
because
he
was
a
poor
supervisor
and
he
had
violated
company
rules,
but
--
mr.
c.
george
niebank,
jr.
except
that
they
were
still
required
in
the
district
court
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
in
their
complaint
even
though
we
had
filed
the
answer.
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
rule
12
(b)
(6).
now,
if
you
assume
that
they
were
in
fact
similarly
situated,
still
we
believe
that
the
complaint
was
properly
dismissed.
here
referring
to
mcdonnell
douglas
against
green
where
they
talk
about
the
essentials
of
a
cause
of
action
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
the
plaintiffs
or
the
petitioners
in
this
case
to
the
--
when
they
alleged
that
they
have
been
discharged
for
theft,
they
in
a
fact
met
the
burden
which
might
otherwise
be
placed
upon
us
of
coming
back
with
our
answer
and
saying
they
were
just
dismissed
for
theft
and
then
the
burden
would
shift
back
to
them,
even
though
we
had
answered
the
fact,
answer
to
that
effect.
they
met
our
burden
and
then
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
allege
something
more
and
that
something
might
have
been
a
pattern
in
practice,
pretext,
they
at
one
point
did
allege
pattern
in
practice,
but
they
abandoned
that
when
it
became
obvious
that
they
could
never
make
it
stick.
and
you
have
heard
some
talk
today
about
pretext?
well,
that
is
an
afterthought
because
they
never
alleged
pretext
in
their
complaint
that
the
theft
was
a
pretext,
discharged
them
because
of
their
race.
also
i
want
to
emphasize
that
our
action
in
this
case
grew
out
of
an
exercise
of
managementâ€™s
discretion
in
discipline.
a
management
must
have
considerable
degree
of
discretion
in
administering
discipline
the
same
way
courts
do
in
administering
sentences
in
criminal
cases.
what
the
petitioners
would
have
this
court
do
is
say
that
there
must
be
a
uniform
sentence
no
matter
what
when
you
have
got
three
people
involved
in
the
same
transaction.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
not
so.
that
management
has
a
right
to
be
lenient,
if
it
chooses
and
that
it
would
not
thereby
run
afoul
of
the
law.
i
would
like
to
touch
very
briefly
on
the
1981
point
which
the
court
below
held
that
whites
are
not
entitled
to
claim
that
relief.
and
there
it
seems
to
me
that
the
parties
of
not
starting
at
the
right
point.
i
think
you
have
to
start
with
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
which
of
course
was
to
--
the
purpose
of
which
to
us
to
abolish
slavery.
and
section
1981
being
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
was
intended
to
implement
that
and
if
you
read
it,
all
persons
shall
enjoy
the
same
rights
are
white
citizens.
if
you
read
it
to
mean
all
white
shall
have
the
same
rights
as
white
citizens
i
submit
that
that
is
redundant.
now,
there
is
legislative
history
of
course
on
both
sides
and
the
courts
are
divided,
but
we
believe
that
the
best
reading
is
one
which
would
restrict
1981
relief
to
blacks
and
other
minorities.
if
1981
is
read
to
confer
or
to
require
or
to
confer
cause
of
action
on
whites
then
you
are
going
to
open
the
gates
to
suits
such
as
the
sears,
roebuck
case,
hollander
v.
sears,
roebuck
in
which
sears
set
up
a
summer
internship
program
for
the
benefit
of
blacks,
a
young
white
man
applied
and
was
of
course
rejected,
so
he
sued.
now,
that
will
have
a
very
serious
impact
on
the
affirmative
action
programs
which
are
the
policy
of
the
united
states
intended
to
assist
the
black
men
and
other
minorities.
thank
you.
