mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
the
central
issue
in
the
case
is
both
basic
and
uncomplicated
and
that
is
should
a
person,
any
person
who
alleges
that
he
or
she
has
been
a
victim
of
racial
discrimination
in
employment
have
an
opportunity
to
have
those
allegations
be
heard
and
tested
in
the
atmosphere
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
we
think
the
answer
to
this
question
is
yes,
both
as
to
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
section
1981.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
courts
below
have
misunderstood,
particularly
in
light
of
the
question
raced
by
mr.
justice
powell
--mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
allegation,
the
mere
facial
allegation
of
some
form
of
wrongdoing
in
this
case,
theft
could
supersede
an
allegation
of
racial
discrimination.
simply
put,
we
believe
that
mcdonnell
douglas
and
the
griggs
decision
make
clear
that
that
particular
allegation
must
be
tested
beyond
the
phase
of
the
pleadings.
that
to
rely
upon
it
outside
the
pleadings
and
indeed
there
was
no
summary
judgment
motion
in
this
case
is
a
mistake
because
it
assumes
a
burden
that
should
be
shifted
at
least
in
some
evidentiary
fashion
to
the
employer.
in
the
mcdonnell
case,
mcdonnell
douglas
case,
the
court
set
a
four-prong
test
in
that
case
stating
that
if
a
person
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination
by
being
a
member
of
a
minority
group,
by
having
been
qualified
for
the
job,
but
rejected
and
by
having
others
accepted
for
the
position,
the
burden
did
shift
and
in
some
evidentiary
fashion
those
allegations
would
have
to
be
tested.
we
believe
that
the
same
essential
ingredients
are
in
this
case,
even
though
the
complainants
were
white
because
in
this
particular
case
they
have
met
the
burden
of
the
first
test
of
mcdonnell
douglas
by
indicating
that
not
only
was
racial
discrimination
practiced,
but
that
three
people,
two
of
which
were
white
one
of
which
is
black
similarly
situated
were
indeed
of
equal
culpability
on
the
face
of
the
pleadings.
now,
we
would
concur
with
the
implication
of
justice
marshall’s
question
that
should
upon
an
evidentiary
hearing,
facts
be
developed
that
would
indicate
a
greater
culpability
or
a
different
culpability
on
the
part
of
the
white
complainants
as
opposed
to
the
black
that
those
factors,
assuming
they
were
not
racial
in
nature,
ought
to
be
able
to
be
controlling
factors,
we
do
not
disagree
with
that.
but
on
the
course
of
the
pleadings,
on
the
face
of
the
pleadings,
those
allegations
simply
do
not
appear
and
to
dismiss
the
case
entirely
simply
because
of
an
alleged
lack
of
standing
and
we
believe
makes
a
gross
error
and
is
a
basic
misconstruction
of
griggs
and
mcdonnell
douglas.
with
regard
to
the
1981
claim,
it
is
our
view
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
in
answer
to
the
questions
presented
here
is
an
inadequate
basis
for
the
statute
and
that
the
reenactment
of
the
statute
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
impart
a
sense
of
equal
protection
concept
and
which
is
not
a
racially
preferential
concept
into
the
statute
itself.
the
thirteenth
amendment
on
the
face
of
it
is
not
a
racially
preferential
statute
as
senator
trumbull
said
when,
who
is
one
of
the
authors
of
the
statute.
the
statute
was
passed
to
protect
those
who
needed
the
benefits
of
it
and
clearly
in
1866,
that
was
the
black
race
and
to
protect
freedmen
after
that
through
the
passage
of
the
1866
statute.
but
never
on
the
face
of
the
statute
nor
in
the
legislative
history
surrounding
its
passage
did
the
debate
supposed
that
it
was
only
for
black
persons.
indeed
there
is
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
that
made
clear
that
in
eliminating
all
badges
of
slavery
and
in
insuring
no
involuntary
servitude,
there
were
effects
of
the
institution
of
slavery
that
might
spill
over
to
adversely
affect
whites
and
thereby
protect
them.
in
other
words,
the
statement
was
made
that
all
discrimination
between
blacks
and
whites
should
be
eliminated
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
thirteenth
amendment.
this
position
was
also
adopted,
i
think
to
a
lesser
extent
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1897
case
in
which
the
court
stated
that
the
implications
of
equal
protection
clause
in
fourteenth
amendment
had
a
gloss
on
the
1981
statute.
we
think
in
other
words,
that
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
has
misconstrued
the
nature
of
the
allegation
of
theft
at
too
early
stage,
at
least
before
it
could
be
clearly
developed
in
evidentiary
hearing.
in
effect,
what
the
court
has
also
done
and
this
is
partially
known
to
as
out
of
having
the
benefit
of
respondent's
briefings
is
virtually
to
invite
us
to
believe
that
racial
discrimination
did
play
a
part
in
this
case.
for
in
the
case,
not
only
do
the
allegations
make
clear
that
the
complainants
in
this
case
and
mr.
jackson,
the
black
were
equally
culpable
as
a
matter
of
allegation,
but
that
in
addition
to
that
they
were
no
other
factors
presented.
in
addition
to
that,
in
the
respondent's
brief
they
acknowledged
at
page
4
that
by
definition
it,
in
this
case
affirm
of
an
action,
involves
at
least
some
measure
of
preference
for
advantage
for
blacks
and
other
racial
minorities
in
connection
with
employment
decisions.
and
they
go
on
at
least
in
a
hypothetical
fashion
to
suggest
that
as
an
abstract
idea
perhaps
every
employment
or
personnel
decision
should
be
colorblind,
but
this
is
a
practical
world
and
few
parts
of
it
are
more
practical
than
employment
decisions.
we
submit
that
absolute
racial
equality
under
every
conceivable
circumstance
would
be
counter
productive.
and
finally
at
page
16
they
invite
us
to
assume
racial
discrimination
may
have
played
a
factor
further,
by
saying
that
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
local
manager
had
been
influenced
to
some
slight
degree
by
mr.
jackson’s
race,
perhaps
thinking
to
himself
“jackson
is
black,
all
things
considered
will
give
him
a
break,”
we
cannot
believe
that
we
thus
run
afoul
of
the
intent
of
congress
expressed
in
title
vii.
but
to
assume
that
those
positions,
if
indeed
they
were
developed
upon
an
evidentiary
hearing,
to
bear
out
those
positions
would
indeed
to
be
assume
that
the
statement
by
the
court
in
griggs
was
wrong
in
which
the
court
said
that
discriminatory
preference
for
any
group,
minority
or
majority,
is
precisely
and
only
what
the
congress
has
proscribed.
so,
our
strong
belief
is
that
the
case
does
not
reach
the
questions
of
what
constitutes
affirmative
action,
especially
since
it
compares
individuals
in
this
particular
case,
not
groups
or
classes
of
protected
persons.
but
in
that
context
an
evidentiary
hearing
must
be
granted
in
order
to
develop
those
facts.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
stanley
pottinger
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
absent
that
the
complaint
was
properly
dismissed.

even
if
