justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
civil
rights
does
the
government
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
i
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
were
to
decide
that
we
would
not
parse
search
warrants
in
civil
proceedings
the
way
we
did
in
aguilar
and
spinelli
in
criminal
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
okay,
aguilar
and
spinelli
were
direct
appeals
in
criminal
proceedings
and
there
the
court
went
into
some
details
as
to
whether
the
affidavit
properly
supported
the
issue
in
civil
warrant.
they
were
criminal
cases.
what
if
we
were
to
decide
in
this
case
that
in
a
civil
proceeding,
we
would
not
go
behind
the
warrant.
we
would
say
it
is
a
--
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
sufficiently
complied
with
when
you
have
taken
your
evidence
before
a
neutral
magistrate
and
we
will
not
worry
about
whether
the
affidavit
was
sufficient
in
the
light
of
the
criminal
holdings
in
aguilar
and
spinelli?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
put
it
the
other
way
around
and
say
that
where
you
are
going
to
impose
criminal
sanctions
on
a
citizen,
you
will
hold
the
government
to
a
higher
standard
than
when
you
are
simply
trying
to
collect
back
taxes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
the
evidence
was
illegally
obtained,
i
take
it
there
has
been
no
trial
of
the
action
that
the
government
might
bring
against
your
client,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
i
meant
is
the
action
--
that
there
–
any
action
that
the
government
seeks
to
bring
against
your
client
yet
been
tried?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
the
--
did
the
government
have
an
opportunity
to
proffer
its
evidence
and
so
forth
at
the
trial
or
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
--
it
does
not
have
to
have
been
on
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
for
the
matter
to
have
gone
off
on
a
motion
to
suppress
or
the
effective
granting
of
a
motion
to
suppress
rather
than
a
full
trial
on
the
merits.
what
i
am
interested
in
is
do
we
know
from
this
record
precisely
what
evidence
it
was
that
the
government
would
have
used
against
you
and
how
do
you
relate
that
particular
evidence
to
the
unlawful
search
and
seizure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
computations
are
not
“evidence”
in
the
normal
understanding
of
the
word,
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
something
as
derived
from
figures
that
were
obtained
from
the
los
angeles
police
department,
i
do
not
think
of
“figures”
being
admissible
in
trial
on
the
ordinary
evidentiary
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
proposed
to
introduce
this
money
at
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
certificate
of
assessments
and
payments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
certainly
did
not
seize
that
from
your
client,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
there
about
the
certificate
of
assessments
and
payments
which
is
the
only
thing
that
was
in
evidence
that
was
illegally
seized?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
well
then
your
--
does
a
third
step
really
in
your
reasoning,
first,
the
los
angeles
police
seized
something
illegally
from
your
client,
then
the
federal
officials
got
a
hold
of
it,
but
they
did
not
used
that
itself
or
they
used
that
in
--
simply
to
make
the
--
to
compile
the
information
in
the
evidence
they
actually
did
seek
to
use.
so
you
got
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
as
well
as
i
would
rather
than
a
direct
use
of
evidence
illegally
seized?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
not
be
more
to
his
own
advantage
though
to
see
that
the
evidence
was
obtained
illegally,
if
his
responsibility
is
primarily
criminal
rather
than
civil?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
say
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
strike
you
as
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
that
a
warrant
should
issue
on
that
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
does
it
strike
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
talking,
well,
you
have
--
as
an
advocate,
i
have
no
right
to
talk
to
you
personally,
i
do
not
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
disposition
of
the
tax
claim?
