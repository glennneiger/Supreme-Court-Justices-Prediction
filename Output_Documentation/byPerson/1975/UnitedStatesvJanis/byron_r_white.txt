justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
suppose
the
federal
tax
people
were
told
or
otherwise
knew
that
the
information
that
was
being
presented
to
it
had
been
obtained
by
patently
illegal
search
and
seizure,
i
know
you
suggest
that
as
a
general
rule
he
should
avoid
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
what
about
in
the
individual
case
where
the
officer
knows,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
they
were
--
even
if
they
were
going
to
say
that
he
would
exclude
evidence
on
the
facts
i
posed,
that
is
not
the
case
here,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
putting
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
necessary
--
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
it,
you
would
say
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
a
civil
context?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
not
suggest
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
only
to
protect
against
--
justice
byron
r.
white
against
--
only
to
protect
criminal
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
even
if
you
could
not
get
a
--
exclude
evidence
in
the
civil
case,
you
could
sue
for
damages,
if
there
had
been
an
illegal
search
or
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
extent
you
argue
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply
to
civil
cases
generally
at
this
juncture
in
our
experience,
do
you
understand
that
you
are
in
a
--
not,
they
are
courts
of
appeals
cases
to
the
contrary
other
than
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
fairly
general
view
in
the
courts
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
i
under
--
what
is
the
--
what
do
you
understand
that
would
be
the
basis
for
the
courts
of
appeals
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
civil
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
shows
from
our
prior
cases
rather
than
a
--
than
reflect
what
the
experience
in
that
circuit
maybe
with
respect
to
the
performance
or
behavior
of
the
internal
revenue
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
tax
cases,
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
thought
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
suarez
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
that
the
--
that
you
may
not
base
assessment
which
you
make
on
illegally
obtained
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
court
of
appeals?
