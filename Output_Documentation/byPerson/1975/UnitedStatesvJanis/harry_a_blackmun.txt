justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
frequently
do
we
have
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
the
irs
is
using
material
so
obtained
from
state
or
local
authorities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
bork,
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
there
any
income
tax
aspect
to
mr.
janis’
problems?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yeah,
i
gather
so,
but
i
am
asking
is
there
any
income
tax
assessment
levied
against
him
that
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
the
object
is
also
to
collect
income
taxes
from
a
very
lucrative
source
as
far
as
narcotics
are
concerned?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
irs
might
well
be
criticized
as
being
less
than
diligent
if
it
did
not
pursue
narcotics
income,
might
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
los
angeles
police
department?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
they
decide
for
the
taxpayer
on
the
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
a
search
warrant
was
issued
by
a
los
angeles
state
judge
and
pursuant
to
that
warrant
the
local
police
seized
from
respondent
janis
about
$5,000
in
cash
and
some
wagering
records.
the
police
then
advised
the
federal
internal
revenue
service
that
janis
had
been
arrested
for
bookmaking
activity.
the
service,
in
its
turn,
calculated
what
his
income
might
have
been
based
upon
the
evidence
so
seized
and
assessed
wagering
excise
taxes
against
him
and
levied
upon
the
cash
in
partial
satisfaction.
later
in
the
state
criminal
proceeding
the
california
court
found
the
affidavit
that
had
supported
the
search
warrant
to
be
defective
and
it
quashed
the
warrant
and
ordered
the
seized
items
returned
to
mr.
janis
except
for
the
cash
that
had
been
levied
upon
in
the
meantime
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
janis
then
filed
a
claim
for
refund
and
brought
the
present
civil
suit.
in
this
federal
tax
suit,
janis
also
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
that
had
been
seized
by
the
los
angeles
police.
the
federal
district
court
granted
that
motion
on
the
ground
that
the
assessment
was
based,
in
large
part,
if
not
completely,
on
evidence
that
had
procured
in
violation
of
janis’s
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
now
this,
of
course,
precisely
poses
the
issue
of
the
application
of
the
so-called
exclusionary
rule
under
the
circumstances.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
evidence,
in
question,
was
obtained
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
issued
on
the
state
side
and
later
decided
in
the
state
criminal
proceeding
that
the
underlying
warrant
was
defective.
meanwhile,
the
evidence
was
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
authorities
and
the
tax
was
assessed.
the
question
is
whether
the
invalidity
of
the
state
warrant
removes
the
evidence
from
the
federal
authority
so
far
as
the
imposition
of
a
federal
tax
is
concerned.
we
hold
that
the
exclusionary
rule,
which
is
judicially
created,
should
not
be
extended
to
forbid
the
use
in
the
civil
proceeding
of
one
sovereign
of
evidence
seized
by
a
criminal
law
enforcement
agent
of
another
sovereign.
we
reach
this
conclusion
because
the
likelihood
of
deterring
law
enforcement
conduct,
through
an
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
this
situation,
is
not
sufficient
to
outweigh
the
cost
to
society
that
the
exclusionary
rule
imposes.
the
prime,
if
not
the
sole
purpose
of
the
rule,
is
to
deter
future
unlawful
police
conduct.
we
feel
that
even
assuming
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
deterrent,
its
use
in
situations,
where
it
is
now
applied,
must
be
deemed
to
suffice
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
any
additional
marginal
deterrence
provided
by
its
extension
in
a
case
like
this
one
does
not
outweigh
the
societal
cost
of
excluding
concededly
relevant
evidence
from
the
federal
trial.
thus,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
