chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
janis.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
might
have
some
effect
i
suppose
on
the
activities
under
the
informant’s
statutes
where
people
secretly
inform,
give
information
that
leads
to
tax
liabilities,
is
that
possible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suggesting
there
is
a
possibility
that
when
a
tax
assessment
or
deficiency
claim
is
based
upon
an
informant’s
information,
this
case
would
perhaps
have
some
implication
that
the
court
must
inquire
or
someone
must
inquire
into
how
the
informant
got
his
information
that
he
passed
on
to
the
internal
revenue,
is
that
possible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
holding
of
the
--
what
we
have
before
us,
essentially
the
district
court
holding,
suppose
the
irs
had
come
to
this
information
by
reading
in
the
los
angeles
times
an
account
of
the
motion
to
suppress
in
the
state
courts
and
then
proceeding
from
that
information
conducted
an
investigation,
does
this
holding
insulate
the
government
or
would
it
be
subject
to
the
same
challenge
that
your
friend
is
making?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
that
knowledge
has
become
public
property
by
virtue
of
being
reported
in
a
newspaper,
account
of
the
motion
to
suppress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
this
--
that
in
the
legendary
language
of
justice
cardozo,
is
the
blunder
of
the
magistrate
not
the
blunder
of
the
constable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
whatever
camara
may
have
or
may
not
have
into
that,
has
that
not
been
swallowed
up
by
harris
and
calandra
and
the
other
cases
you
refer
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sturman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
that
effect
the
basic
proposition
that
is
presented
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
in
fact
the
basic
issue
in
more
--
in
sharper
relief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
walder
case,
followed
by
the
harris
case
for
example?
those
are
both
criminal
cases,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
evidence
even
though
concededly
obtained
initially
in
violation,
nevertheless
was
admissible
in
the
criminal
case
for
impeachment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
interest
does
a
policeman
in
los
angeles
have
in
seeing
that
the
federal
government
gets
its
proper
tax
revenues?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
different
from
yours
or
mine
to
see
that
everybody
pays
his
fair
share
of
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
way
they
got
to
al
capone
back
40
years
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
that
anymore,
let
us
say,
saying
$89,000.00
in
taxes
is
always
painful,
whether
you
are
a
legitimate
businessman
or
part
of
the
mafia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
gives
a
straight
fire,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
internal
revenue
service
deter
or
influence
the
conduct
of
the
los
angeles
police?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
bureau
of
narcotics
might
say
that
the
los
angeles
police,
if
you
contend
you
are
using
getting
defective
warrants
we
are
not
going
to
cooperate
with
you
on
the
narcotics
traffic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
(inaudible).
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you,
mr.
sturman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-958,
united
sates
against
janis
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
