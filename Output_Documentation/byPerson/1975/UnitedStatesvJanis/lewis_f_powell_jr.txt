justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
would
you
have
a
different
case
if
the
internal
revenue
service
agents
had
seized
this
records
and
this
money
directly
themselves
by
a
warrantless
search?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
sturman,
can
i
go
back
a
moment
to
the
statements
you
have
made
some
time
ago.
as
i
understood
you,
you
expressed
the
view
that
you
are
not
taking
what
might
be
called
a
per
se
position.
you
were
not
saying
that
all
illegally
obtained
evidence
must
be
excluded
so
far
as
irs
is
concerned
or
stating
affirmatively
you
were
suggesting
that
the
irs
under
some
circumstances
could
use
illegally
obtained
evidence.
would
you
suggest
some
examples
of
when
that
would
be
proper
in
your
judgment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
in
this
case
that
the
los
angeles
policeman
had
not
tipped
the
irs,
but
the
irs
had
discovered
the
fact
that
this
evidence
was
available
through
its
own
independent
sources
and
had
gone
to
the
la
police,
i
think
that
question
was
put
to
you
earlier,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i
still
cannot
quite
visualize
a
specific
case
that
you
would
agree
that
the
irs
made
properly
use
the
illegally
seized
evidence,
seized
illegally
by
as
you
say
an
officer
of
either
the
state
or
federal
government?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
you
are
saying
that
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
independent
of
the
illegally
seized
evidence
to
support
their
assessment,
their
assessment
would
stand?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
would
be
true
in
any
case
involving
the
exclusion
of
illegally
seized
evidence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
in
the
end
you
are
standing
on
--
on
a
view
that
if
the
government
has
to
rely
on
illegally
seized
evidence
in
every
case
that
would
not
be
permissible
under
the
constitution?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
alright.
