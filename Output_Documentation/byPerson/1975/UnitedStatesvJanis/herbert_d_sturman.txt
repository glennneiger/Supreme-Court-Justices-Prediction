mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
commencing
with
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
thing
which
i
believe
is
in
doubt
right
now
and
that
is,
the
solicitor
referred
to
this
case
as
being
decided
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
record
is
very
clear
that
the
plaintiff
had
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
this
case.
that
motion
was
denied
in
april
of
1972.
in
february
of
1973,
this
case
came
to
trial
in
the
federal
district
court.
all
parties
had
an
opportunity
to
present
any
evidence
that
they
desired.
accordingly,
although
the
case
was
tried
on
stipulated
facts
and
exhibits
which
were
submitted
by
stipulation,
all
parties
were
represented,
all
parties
were
in
the
position
to
submit
any
additional
evidence
that
the
parties
had.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
it
would
affect
the
basic
proposition
because
the
government
has
chosen
to
rely
solely
on
its
certificate
of
assessment.
it
has
not
sought
to
introduce
any
other
additional
evidence,
any
untainted
evidence.
it
is
not
thought
to
put
anyone
on
the
stand
who
could
attest
to
the
fact
that
perhaps
the
plaintiff
was
a
bookmaker,
that
perhaps
the
plaintiff
was
engaged
in
bookmaking
activities.
it
relies
solely
upon
a
certificate
of
assessment,
which
in
turn
is
based
solely
upon
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
taxpayer’s
fourth
amendment
right.
and
i
think
it
is
significant
because
as
a
former
government
counsel,
i
know
that
had
i
tried
that
case,
i
might
have
put
a
lot
more
evidence
into
the
record
and
try
to
put
evidence
into
the
record,
but
here
we
have
a
naked
certificate
of
assessment.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
it
does
put
the
basic
issue
into
relief
very
clearly.
the
government’s
position
appears
to
be
that
number
one;
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied
in
a
civil
case
and
primarily
that
the
rule
should
not
be
applied
because
it
will
not
constitute
a
deterrent.
additionally,
as
mentioned
in
the
government’s
brief,
the
government
contends
that
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
exclusionary
rule
maybe
applied,
the
federal
tax
assessment
retains
its
presumption
of
validity
and
as
such
the
taxpayer
has
a
further
burden
in
order
to
rebut
this
presumption
of
validity.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
solicitor
general,
i
believe
that
deterrence
argument
is
really
here
in
this
case.
our
record
establishes
that
the
los
angeles
police
officer
who
had
arrested
the
taxpayer
had
contacted
the
internal
revenue
service
as
a
matter
of
his
policy,
as
a
matter
of
police
procedure.
he
testified
that
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
he
said
it
was
his
police
procedure,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
his
police
procedure.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
it
is
not
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
police
department.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
your
honor
raises
an
interesting
question
which
is
precisely
what
happened
in
the
suarez
case
in
the
tax
court.
the
internal
revenue
service
obtained
the
information
in
that
case
from
the
newspaper.
the
newspaper
article
was
printed.
the
internal
revenue
service
then
went
to
see
the
police
department
and
the
tax
court
in
suarez
held
that
since
the
proposed
assessment
was
based
solely
upon
illegally
obtained
evidence,
the
assessment
was
stripped
off
its
presumption
of
validity,
therefore,
the
government
had
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
untainted
evidence
in
order
to
establish
the
assessment.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
not
my
position,
your
honor.
our
case
is
based
on
a
very
careful
record
and
our
record
clearly
establishes
that
the
assessment
was
based
solely
upon
illegally
obtained
evidence.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
the
government
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
conceded
that
the
evidence
was
illegally
obtained.
now,
the
government
has
taken
somewhat
of
a
lesser
conciliatory
position.
however,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
thing
that
chief
justice
stated
about
that
and
that
is
that
the
blunder
of
the
magistrate
is
what
we
have
here
as
opposed
to
the
blunder
of
the
law
enforcement
official.
i
do
not
think
we
have
that
at
all.
if
you
read
that
affidavit
that
the
law
enforcement
official
submitted,
the
affidavit
clearly
shows
that
that
law
enforcement
official
was
familiar
with
the
aguilar
case,
because
he
details
with
particularity
the
credibility
of
his
informant,
but
he
has
nothing
in
there
with
respect
to
the
underlying
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
the
informant’s
tip.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
then
what
your
honor
is
suggesting
is
a
different
standard
for
the
admissibility
of
evidence
in
a
civil
case
as
opposed
to
a
criminal
case.
but
i
think
that
what
you
would
be
doing
here
is
you
would
say
that
the
fourth
amendment,
you
would
be
giving
a
criminal
greater
dignity
than
a
civil
taxpayer.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
it
is
the
same
fourth
amendment
applying
to
all
people.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
now,
i
would
assume
that
if
you
have
a
violation
of
a
person’s
fourth
amendment
rights
that
that
violation
should
be
the
same
whether
it
is
--
rights
are
violated,
whether
it
be
for
criminal
purposes
or
whether
it
be
for
civil
purposes.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
i
believe,
your
honor,
they
were.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
for
impeachment
purposes,
yes
your
honor.
but
there
is
a
difference
between
impeachment
purposes
and
taking
that
evidence
and
using
that
evidence
as
the
sole
basis
for
a
civil
tax
assessment.
a
civil
tax
assessment
can
have
the
same
effect
as
a
threat
of
incarceration
or
actual
incarceration.
the
government
has
very
powerful
tools
in
the
levying
procedure
and
in
the
assessment
procedure.
but
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
this
case,
i
really
think
that
the
potential
effects
could
be
catastrophic
and
here
is
why.
the
court
in
essence
would
be
giving
a
license
to
all
law
enforcement
officials
to
violate
constitutional
rights
where
a
crime
which
would
give
rise
to
tax
liability
is
involved
and
a
law
enforcement
official
knowing
that
his
evidence,
although
insufficient
for
a
criminal
prosecution,
may
nevertheless
be
used
for
civil
tax
liability,
may
very
well
go
after
that
evidence
and
if
the
object
of
the
rule
is
to
deter,
we
wanted
to
deter
that
type
of
conduct.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
well,
your
honor
he
has
a
very
close
interest.
he
has
a
close
interest
for
several
reasons.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
he
has
--
his
interest
is
to
prevent
crime,
which
is
a
commendable
interest.
however,
there
are
many
ways
of
skinning
a
cat
and
one
of
the
ways
of
preventing
crime
is
through
the
use
of
the
civil
processes
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
i
did
not
say
that,
your
honor.
that
was
a
criminal
case,
i
believe.
i
am
talking
about
the
threat
of
a
civil
tax
assessment,
of
a
jeopardy
assessment,
of
a
levy,
of
a
seizure
of
property.
this
is
a
very,
very
powerful
governmental
weapon
and
these
law
enforcement
officials
know
it
and
in
fact
the
federal
government
knows
it.
the
federal
government
has
all
these
task
forces
today,
coordinating
with
local
law
enforcement
agencies.
for
example,
the
bureau
of
narcotics
coordinates
with
police
officers
throughout
the
united
states
and
as
part
of
that
coordination,
the
internal
revenue
service
is
involved
because
of
the
narcotics
tax.
so
there
is
a
very
close
cooperation
between
state
and
federal
agencies.
the
object
is
to
prevent
crime
and
one
of
the
ways
of
preventing
crime
is
through
the
use
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
the
object
is
to
collect
income
taxes
and
the
collection
process
is
commendable,
but
the
collection
process
can
be
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
irs
should
pursue
narcotics
income.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
irs
should
pursue
a
bookmaker’s
income,
but
let
us
look
at
what
we
really
have
in
this
case.
we
have
a
situation
where
a
taxpayer’s
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
a
governmental
agency,
not
the
united
states
of
america,
but
a
local
governmental
agency.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
the
los
angeles
police
department.
alright,
now
we
have
the
internal
revenue
service
as
a
result
of
this
violation,
imposing
tax
liability
against
the
taxpayer
and
the
internal
revenue
service
is
saying
that
even
though
our
evidence
is
based
--
is
illegally
obtained
under
the
fourth
amendment,
which
apparently
was
conceded
in
petitioner’s
brief
and
now
i
am
not
so
sure,
even
though
it
was
illegally
obtained,
even
if
the
court
were
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
nevertheless,
there
is
superior
burden
which
attaches
to
a
civil
tax
assessment.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
there
--
the
evidence
was
obtained
by
the
los
angeles
police
department.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
yes.
this
case
right
here.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
we
are
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
what
is
happening
here
is,
we
as
the
plaintiff
have
sued
for
approximately
a
$5,000.00
refund.
the
internal
revenue
service
as
a
matter
of
policy
has
denied
our
claim
for
refund
and
has
also
filed
a
counter
claim
wherein
it
is
seeking
to
collect
approximately
$85,000.00
with
interest.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
precisely
the
first
point
i
made
when
i
stood
up
here
and
wanted
to
correct
something
for
the
record
that
this
was
not
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
alright.
we
know
exactly
what
evidence
is
involved.
the
evidence
that
was
involved
is
approximately
$5,000.00
in
cash
which
the
government
seized.
the
further
evidence
is
bookmaking
markers,
bookmaking
paraphernalia
upon
which
the
government
made
its
determination
that
the
taxpayer
was
engaged
in
bookmaking
activities
for
a
five-day
period
and
they
arrived
at
his
daily
gross
for
that
five-day
period.
they
then
discussed
with
the
los
angeles
police
department
a
period
of
surveillance
and
they
made
a
determination
that
the
taxpayer
had
been
engaged
in
bookmaking
activities
for
a
77-day
period
and
they
averaged
out
his
daily
gross
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
excise
tax,
which
is
a
percentage
of
the
gross
volume
of
activities.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
an
excise
tax
based
on
bookmaking
activities.
all
evidence
that
the
taxpayer
was
a
bookmaker
was
illegally
obtained
evidence.
all
evidence
of
bookmaking
activities
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
taxpayer’s
fourth
amendment
rights.
so
we
have
a
naked
assessment,
derived
that
from
figures
which
the
revenue
service
got
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
who
would
had
obtained
though
that
information
as
a
result
of
a
defective
search
warrant.
am
i
being
responsive
to
your
question
your
honor?
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
they
have
got
money
plus
they
had
notations
as
to
--
in
order
to
determine
the
volume
of
bookmaking.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
no.
they
proposed
to
introduce
and
they
did
introduce
what
is
found
on
the
last
page
of
the
appendix
and
that
is
the
only
piece
of
evidence
offered
by
the
government
other
than
the
evidence,
which
was
stipulated
to
in
the
pre-trial
conference
order.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
no.
the
certificate
of
assessment
and
payments
is
really
the
government’s
bill
so
to
speak.
it
is
what
they
contend
that
the
taxpayer
owes.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
it
is
the
--
this
--
the
information
contained
on
this
certificate
of
assessment
and
payments
are
derived
from
completely
as
a
result
of
the
search
which
violated
the
taxpayer’s
fourth
amendment
right.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
what
the
government
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
the
suarez
case,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
suarez
case
says
we
have
to
weigh
on
the
one
hand
the
tax
collection
process
and
on
the
other
hand
we
have
to
weigh
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals.
in
the
suarez
case
in
the
tax
court,
which
is
basically
a
pro-government
court
found
that
the
tax
collection
procedure
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
alright,
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
they
did
decide
for
the
taxpayer
and
they
found
that
the
constitutional
rights
were
paramount.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
well,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
there
may
very
well
be
situations
where
the
internal
revenue
service
has
on
its
own
sufficient
evidence
and
that
there
is
also
other
evidence
which
is
illegally
obtained
and
the
use
of
the
illegally
obtained
evidence
would
not
sufficiently
taint
the
assessment.
but
i
would
suggest
that
on
this
record,
the
entire
assessment
is
based
solely
upon
illegally
obtained
evidence.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
in
my
view,
no
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
it
would
not
make
a
difference.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
your
honor,
perhaps
i
was
not
responsive
to
your
question.
i
do
no
think
the
irs
should
be
able
to
use
any
illegal
evidence,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
a
portion
of
the
assessment
is
predicated
upon
illegally
obtained
evidence
and
a
sufficient
portion
of
the
assessment
is
predicated
on
other
evidence,
then
the
assessment
should
stand
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
and
that
is
--
that
is
precisely
the
position.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
there
is
one
further
thing
and
that
is,
illegally
obtained
evidence
in
a
civil
case
will
have
a
much
more
detrimental
effect
against
the
victim
than
if
it
were
to
get
into
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
and
the
reason
being
because
of
the
difference
of
burdens
of
proof.
in
a
criminal
case,
the
government
has
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
here
the
government
has
a
presumption
of
validity
in
its
assessment
and
it
only
has
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
so
the
admission
of
the
illegally
obtained
evidence
is
more
detrimental
to
the
civil
litigant
than
it
is
to
the
criminal
litigant
because
of
the
different
standards
in
burden
of
proof.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
it
is
painful,
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
correct,
but
the
point
is
pain
as
a
consequence
of
one
governmental
agency
using
illegally
obtained
evidence
from
another
governmental
agency
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
very
easily.
how
can
we
deter
because
as
i
mentioned
before
we
have
the
task
force.
we
have
the
closed
governmental
cooperation
and
the
los
angeles
police
works
very
closely
with
the
bureau
of
narcotics.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
no,
the
bureau
of
narcotics
may
say
that
the
los
angeles
police
get
them
under
any
circumstances
and
this
may
seem
harsh,
but
the
bureau
of
narcotics
are
comprised
of
people
who
want
to
stop
the
narcotics
traffic
and
often
times
the
ends
justify
the
means
and
law
enforcement
official’s
conduct
should
be
deterred
and
one
of
the
ways
of
deterring
that
is
by
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case.
because
if
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
applied,
then
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
every
law
enforcement
official
who
is
involved
in
preventing
crime
which
will
give
rise
to
tax
producing
--
involves
tax
producing
conduct
“go
out
to
get
his
evidence
under
any
circumstances.”
he
will
get
the
evidence
for
the
simple
reason
that
if
he
cannot
use
that
evidence
at
his
level
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
the
evidence
may
be
turned
over
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
so
he
will
be
in
essence
accomplishing
indirectly
what
he
cannot
accomplish
directly.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
of
course,
it
would
be
to
his
advantage,
but
there
are
situations
where
the
evidence
is
difficult
to
come
by.
for
example,
in
this
affidavit
that
we
have
here,
we
do
not
have
a
blunder
by
a
magistrate.
we
have
a
blunder
by
a
police
officer
who
detailed
very
carefully
what
the
actions
--
the
reliability
of
the
informant,
but
had
no
reference
whatsoever
as
to
what
the
underlying
basis
of
the
tip
was
or
maybe
there
was
no
underlying
basis,
maybe
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
was
engaged
in
bookmaking
activities
was
casually
overheard
in
the
neighborhood
bar.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
that
is
pointed
out
in
spinelli.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
you
see,
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
are
you
talking
to
me
personally
or
as
an
advocate?
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
here
is
what
i
think
we
have
here.
we
have
a
situation
where
you
have
the
initial
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
evidence
was
illegally
obtained.
the
next
question
is,
if
it
is
illegally
obtained,
should
it
be
excluded
because
of
the
deterrent
effect
and
the
final
question
is
we
exclude
it
in
criminal
cases,
should
we
exclude
it
in
civil
cases?
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
no
matter
what
the
views
of
the
various
justices
are,
if
the
evidence
is
illegally
obtained
in
the
first
place,
it
is
got
to
be
excluded,
assuming
a
deterrent
effect
can
be
found.
and
i
think
that
the
area
of
reform,
so
to
speak,
and
i
am
now
getting
exactly
back
to
your
question,
is
on
whether
or
not,
the
evidence
was
initially
illegally
obtained
in
the
first
place.
it
was
clearly
illegally
obtained
under
aguilar.
it
was
clearly
illegally
obtained
under
spinelli,
but
i
cannot
control
the
eight
members
of
this
court
as
to
whether
it
is
clearly
illegally
obtained
today.
thank
you,
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
there
are
--
there
are
several
others.
there
is
of
course
this
case
and
in
addition
to
that
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
pardon
me.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
this
came
from
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
there
is
a
--
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
well,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
in
the
tax
court
itself?
mr.
herbert
d.
sturman
i
do
not
know
that.
i
would
believe
it
would
have
to
be
because
the
--
i
think
it
is
a
full
panel
of
the
tax
court
that
had
heard
that
case.
so
it
would
be
followed
in
the
tax
court.
there
are,
however,
other
circuit
courts
that
have
gone
along
with
our
argue
--
the
contentions
advanced
by
the
taxpayer
today
and
there
are
numerous
other
opinions.
there
is
only
one
case
which
really
creates
a
conflict
and
that
is
compton
versus
united
states.
thank
you,
your
honor.
