mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
upon
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court’s
grant
of
summary
judgment
against
the
united
states
and
did
so
on
the
basis
of
the
district
court’s
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
without
any
opinion
of
its
own.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
respondent,
both
upon
his
suit
for
a
refund
of
taxes
collected
under
assey
and
also
upon
the
government’s
counterclaim
for
the
unpaid
balance
of
the
assessment.
now,
the
facts
underlying
this
suit
are
very
simple.
the
los
angeles
police
department
prepared
an
affidavit,
somewhat
lengthy
design
to
show
a
probable
cause
for
a
search
and
obtained
from
a
municipal
court
judge
a
warrant
directing
a
search
for
a
bookmaking
paraphernalia
and
in
the
search
that
ensued,
respondent
and
one
morris
levine
were
arrested
and
certain
property,
including
a
$4,940.00
in
cash
were
seized.
shortly
after
that
occurred,
the
los
angeles
police
officer
notified
a
revenue
agent
of
the
internal
revenue
service
of
the
arrest
and
of
the
seizure.
there
is
a
federal
tax
of
course
on
wages
and
since
respondent
and
levine
had
filed
no
tax
returns
for
the
period
in
question,
the
internal
revenue
service
checked
the
wagering
records
and
calculated
the
number
of
days,
the
surveillance
of
respondent
levine
suggested
that
the
--
indicated
that
the
wagering
activity
had
gone
on,
that
indicated
a
period
of
77
days.
working
with
that
information,
the
service
made
an
assessment
against
respondent
levine
of
about
$89,000.00
plus
interest.
and
pursuant
to
that
assessment,
the
internal
revenue
service
levied
upon
the
cash
seized
by
the
los
angeles
police
in
partial
satisfaction
of
respondent’s
tax
liability.
the
state
prosecution
for
respondent
levine
for
illegal
gambling
found
that
when
the
same
municipal
court
judge
who
had
issued
the
warrant
granted
a
motion
to
quash
it
on
the
ground
that
the
supporting
affidavit
was
inadequate
to
show
the
reliability
of
the
information
passed
on
by
the
informants,
although
it
was
adequate
to
show
--
indicate
the
reliability
of
the
informants
themselves.
two
years
later,
respondent
began
this
tax
refund
suit
and
as
i
have
said,
the
government
counterclaimed
for
the
unpaid
balance
of
the
assessment.
now,
the
cases
hold
that
a
taxpayer
claiming
a
refund
or
opposing
a
collection
suit
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
real
tax
liability.
respondent
presented
no
evidence
upon
that
issue,
whatever.
he
relied
exclusively
upon
a
motion
to
suppress
the
tax
assessment
on
the
ground
that
the
information
upon
which
the
assessment
was
based
had
been
illegally
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
district
court
accepted
that
theory
and
suppressed
the
assessment
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
as
i
say
per
curiam
and
without
opinion.
i
think
the
legal
theory
underlying
these
decisions
below
is
an
extraordinary
one
or
rather
it
must
be
an
extraordinary
one
because
it
is
not
articulated
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
beyond
the
statement
that
the
government’s
assessment
grew
out
of
knowledge
that
was
ultimately
held
to
have
been
obtained
by
a
search
warrant
that
did
not
meet
fourth
amendment
standards,
a
warrant
obtained
by
the
los
angeles
police.
how
that
fact
connects
with
this
tax
litigation
is
nowhere
explained
and
i
will
attempt
to
show
that
there
is
no
adequate
connection.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
court
below
without
analysis
or
argument
had
fashioned
a
sweeping
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
when
i
say
without
argument,
i
mean
without
argument
by
the
court.
this
extension
amounts
to
a
new
rule
that
not
only
may
evidence
be
excluded
from
judicial
proceedings,
but
that
the
government
maybe
required
to
forgo
its
civil
rights,
if
it
knew
of
its
civil
rights,
only
because
some
other
government
obtained
information
under
a
warrant
subsequently
held
to
be
inadequate.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
right
to
the
collection
of
taxes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
meant,
its
right
in
the
civil
litigation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
suppose
it
would
be
if
they
have
given
the
information
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
i
do
not
think
it
would
apply
in
this
situation
where
the
information
was
given
to
the
los
angeles
police
department
for
a
criminal
investigation,
at
least
not
that
i
know
of.
there
is
certainly
no
--
nothing
in
this
record
to
at
least
suggest
any
such
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
suppose
it
is
possible
mr.
chief
justice.
i
suppose
in
the
case
of
an
informant
speaking
directly
to
internal
revenue
service
and
the
internal
revenue
service
would
verify
the
information
in
some
other
way
before
they
could
collect
the
taxes.
no,
i
think
you
are
right
you
are
right.
they
might
make
an
assessment
on
the
basis
of
that
information
which
could
be
hearsay
even
as
a
grand
jury’s
indictment
could
be
based
on
hearsay
and
if
the
assessment
were
resulted
in
the
collection,
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
one
might,
mr.
justice
powell.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
respondent’s
brief
here,
that
if
this
evidence,
if
this
assessment
is
not
suppressed,
internal
revenue
agents
will
be
free
to
break
into
homes
and
offices.
i
find
that
suggestion
mildly
humorous
because
i
do
not
think
the
internal
revenue
services
have
such
intention
or
perhaps
indeed
capacity.
but
i
will
suggest
in
the
course
of
this
argument
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
extend
the
exclusionary
rule
to
civil
litigation.
but
the
basis
for
that
suggestion
essentially
is
that
in
the
world
as
we
know
it
and
as
the
court
observe
it,
illegal
searches
and
seizures
primarily
occur
in
connection
with
criminal
investigation
and
there
just
is
not
much
evidence
of
or
any
perhaps
evidence
of
illegal
search
and
seizure
in
civil
matters.
should
that
become
common
by
the
internal
revenue
service
or
any
other
agency
of
government,
then
i
suppose
the
time
would
have
come
to
consider
the
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
that
class
of
cases.
but
as
the
matter
stand
now,
we
have
nothing
like
that
and
it
would
be
a
different
case
as
you
suggest.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
only
thing
in
the
record
on
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
the
statement
by
the
police
officer
here
that
when
it
was
a
large
bookmaking
operation,
he
generally
passed
the
--
notified
the
internal
revenue
service,
for
the
smaller
one
he
did
not.
he
said
that
was
not
a
departmental
policy
and
he
supposed
that
some
other
officers
would
not
notify
the
irs,
but
he
would.
as
a
nationwide
matter,
i
frankly
do
not
know
the
frequency
with
which
it
occurs.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
the
issue
is
always
an
issue
of
general
deterrence
and
not
an
issue
of,
are
we
upset
about
this
case
because
this
court
has
recognized
it
is
too
late
to
repair
the
privacy
or
interest
of
the
individual
raising
the
case.
all
that
can
be
done
is
to
deter
the
police
for
the
future.
if
there
were
a
common
pattern
and
practice
by
which
police
in
any
city
or
police
generally
conducted
unconstitutional
raids
for
the
purpose
of
handing
the
information
over
to
the
irs,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
kind
of
case
altogether
and
we
would
have
to
consider
at
that
point
the
fashioning
of
an
exclusionary
rule
when
the
internal
revenue
service
attempted
to
benefit
by
that
kind
of
a
practice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
not
at
all
the
case
here.
i
was
--
this
case
is
a
case
in
which
so
far
that
all
the
facts
indicate,
the
los
angeles
police
department
acted
in
the
utmost
good
faith,
obtained
a
warrant
and
the
internal
revenue
service
acted
in
the
utmost
good
faith
and
i
will
suggest
indeed
in
a
moment
that
i
think
it
is
probably
unlikely
that
the
--
the
evidence
should
have
been
excluded
even
in
the
state
trial,
much
less
in
the
internal
revenue’s
proceedings.
the
crucial
element
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
will
suggest
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
when
a
warrant
has
been
obtained,
when
the
primary
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
has
been
carried
out
to
force
or
to
urge
that
they
will
get
the
police
before
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
and
when
they
make
a
good
faith
and
bona
fide
effort
to
show
a
probable
cause
and
later
it
is
said
that
there
is
a
procedural
defect,
indeed
on
the
--
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
magistrate,
if
he
had
asked
in
this
case,
something
did
not
satisfy
him,
it
is
quite
likely
the
information
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
is
one
way
to
decide
this
case.
as
i
look
at
this
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
anything,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
district
court
merely
had
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
as
i
look
at
this
case,
there
are
so
many
ways
it
could
be
decided.
and
i
suggest
that
they
are
always,
it
could
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
government,
that
i
would
urge
upon
you
a
variety
of
ways
to
cut
this
case
for
a
decision.
one
of
them
of
course
is
the
one
i
have
just
mentioned,
because
the
crucial
element
in
the
exclusionary
rule
is
the
factor
of
deterrence.
is
there
a
realistic
judgment
that
excluding
evidence
in
a
particular
class
of
cases
will
actually
deter
police
officials
or
others
from
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
or
force
them
before
magistrates?
now,
i
think
deterrence
is
not
usually
applied,
the
people
who
have
acted
in
complete
good
faith
and
turned
out
to
be
mistaken
in
a
close
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
would,
mr.
chief
justice
would
be
subject
to
the
same
challenge
that
my
brother
is
making
here.
i
think
this
is
an
extraordinary
sweeping
ruling
which
says
i
think
that
if
the
government’s
knowledge
can
be
traced
back
through
how
many
--
however
many
links
to
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
have
that
knowledge.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
it
were
not
the
view
of
the
court
below
and
of
my
brother
here
that
the
government
would
be
foreclosed
in
such
a
case,
then
i
think
it
would
be
relevantly
unimportant
that
the
government
was
told
by
a
los
angeles
police
officer
because
the
government
could
have
leaned
of
it
easily
later
through
the
proceedings
in
the
municipal
court.
i
think
it
is
a
very
sweeping
rule
that
is
being
--
is
being
urged
upon
us.
i
suppose
i
could
distinguish
the
case
you
put,
but
in
honesty,
i
think
the
rational
below
really
says
that
if
the
knowledge
derives
from
the
illegal,
illegally
seized
evidence,
it
may
not
be
used.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
think
it
has
been
suggested,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
those
other,
particularly
judicial
integrity
interests,
run
just
about
parallel
with
deterrence,
so
that
the
analysis
turns
out
to
be
much
the
same
and
indeed
if
judicial
integrity
meant
that
evidence
of
this
sort
could
not
be
used
in
this
tax
litigation,
then
i
would
really
suppose
that
you
would
have
to
overrule
harris
against
new
york,
calandra,
peltier
because
those
are
all
cases
in
which
evidence
of
this
sort
gets
used
in
some
way
and
if
judicial
integrity
means
that
under
no
circumstances
may
anything
happen
because
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
true,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
walder.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
but
i
do
recall
that
it
was
the
same
as
walder
or
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
alright
[laughter]
in
any
event
i
think
this
rule,
one
of
which
i
urge
that
when
a
warrant
has
been
sought
in
good
faith
with
a
good
faith
attempt
to
show
a
probable
cause,
that
there
are
ought
not
to
be
exclusion,
but
obviously
go
beyond
this
case.
we
go
to
criminal
cases
and
there
is
a
basis
for
decisions,
a
decision
like
that.
for
example,
aguilar
against
texas
notes
that
a
magistrate’s
mistake
is
not
to
be
taken
as
seriously
as
a
police
officer’s
mistake
when
he
acts
without
a
warrant
and
there
is
the
observation
in
peltier
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct,
then
evidence
obtained
from
a
search
should
be
suppressed
only
if
it
can
be
said
that
the
law
enforcement
officer
had
knowledge
or
maybe
properly
be
charged
with
knowledge
that
the
search
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
is
certainly
much
of
what
is
involved
here
mr.
chief
justice.
we
had
a
police
officer
make
a
good
faith
attempt
to
put
as
much
information
as
he
could
and
a
magistrate
accepted
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
there
had
been
no
warrant?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
in
this
case
i
was
just
offering
one.
i
would
indeed
because
i
think
there
is
no
deterrence
here,
but
i
think
i
was
offering
one
way
to
cut
the
case.
the
other
way
to
cut
the
case
is
that
this
is
a
civil
litigation
and
for
the
reasons
i
have
discussed
earlier,
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
extend
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
civil
litigation
when
we
know
that
in
this
class
of
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
is
anything
to
deter.
and
in
calandra
of
course
it
is
noted
that
the
standing
requirement
is
premised
on
the
recognition
that
the
need
for
deterrence
enhance
the
rationale
for
excluding
the
evidence
are
strongest
where
the
government’s
unlawful
conduct
would
result
in
the
imposition
of
a
criminal
sanction.
now,
it
maybe
that
camara
against
municipal
court
comes
close
to
saying
that
exclusionary
rule
or
that
warrants
can
be
required
in
civil
cases,
however,
that
of
course
resulted
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
have
suggested
earlier
that
indeed
if
one
began
to
see
a
pattern
of
unlawful
searched
and
seizures
in
the
enforcement
of
civil
liability,
that
it
might
become
necessary
to
consider
the
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
civil
cases,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
is
ahead
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
just
suggesting
that
there
is
a
suggestion
in
camara
that
even
if
it
were
a
purely
civil
case,
a
warrant
might
be
required
in
that
context
and
i
was
merely
suggesting
that
i
am
not
trying
to
draw
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
will
try
to
strengthen
the
observation.
the
warrant
can
be
required
in
that
context,
but
that
was
a
criminal
prosecution,
the
opinion
also
noted.
so
that
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
direct
holding
that
the
exclusionary
rule
or
warrant
requirement
might
always
be
in
--
used
in
civil
cases,
but
i
am
willing
to
recognize
the
possibility
that
in
a
variety
of
kinds
of
civil
cases,
if
you
get
unlawful
searches
and
seizures,
as
a
pattern,
one
might
extend
the
exclusionary
rule
to
that
kind
of
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
do
not
need
the
exclusionary
rule
at
present
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
suggesting
because
we
have
no
pattern
of
unlawful
searches
and
seizures
to
enforce
civil
liability.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
at
all,
if
i
did
i
misspoke.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
but
here,
if
we
are
taking
about
deterrence
realistically,
it
seems
to
be
bad
enough
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
los
angeles
police
behavior
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
a
little
short
of
ludicrous
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
internal
revenue
service
in
this
case.
i
cannot
imagine
what
it
is
that
the
internal
revenue
service
was
expected
to
do
differently
in
the
future.
i
cannot
imagine
what
behavior
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
to
be
modified.
the
only
result
here
is
that
respondent
escapes
paying
taxes
that
other
people
in
respondent’s
position
must
pay.
the
deterrent
rationale
here
has
reached
a
vanishing
point.
there
is
one
aspect
of
respondent’s
brief
not
discussed
in
ours
and
i
should
mention
it
briefly.
he
raises
a
fifth
amendment
point
at
the
end
of
his
brief.
the
argument
being
apparently
that
for
respondent
to
meet
his
burden
of
proof
to
establish
his
tax
liability,
he
would
have
to
incriminate
himself
because
if
they
are
short
of
saying
he
was
not
engaged
in
bookmaking,
he
would
have
to
say
i
was
engaged
in
bookmaking,
but
it
did
not
make
that
much
money.
in
the
first
place
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
this
question
here
is
a
pending.
decision
below
is
entirely
about
the
fact
that
the
government
learned
of
the
respondent’s
activities
because
of
a
search
later
held
to
be
unlawful
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
this
case,
the
statute
of
limitations
both
federal
and
state
have
run.
this
case
goes
back
for
trial.
i
do
not
think
there
is
no
possibility,
respondent
can
incriminate
himself.
he
was
arrested
on
november
30,
1968.
the
longest
california
statute
is
three
years,
federal
statute
is
five.
indeed
it
is
not
shown
that
he
meets
the
other
requirements
of
the
federal
statute.
and
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
insofar
as
this
is
a
generalizable
problem
and
not
really
a
problem
relating
to
this
respondent,
the
tax
court
makes
irregular
practice
of
deferring
civil
litigation
until
either
the
criminal
trial,
if
there
is
one
has
been
held
and
those
proceedings
are
closed
or
until
the
statute
of
limitations
is
run
so
that
the
taxpayer
is
not
put
to
the
choice
of
incriminating
himself
or
giving
up
his
money.
and
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
iannelli
case,
iannelli
against
long,
487
f.2d
317
at
318
has
specifically
authorized
this
practice
and
indeed
said
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
if
a
district
court
refused
to
put
a
civil
litigation
over,
so
that
the
respondent
will
not
be
put
to
that
kind
of
a
choice.
i
do
not
think
that
is
in
the
case
here,
but
respondent
has
raised
it
and
i
thought
i
would
mention
it.
so
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
this
is
a
judicial
practice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
not
written
down.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
of
the
tax
court,
i
gather
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
third
circuit
said,
the
district
court
was
understandably
--
no
it
is
not.
it
just
does
not
discuss
the
tax
court
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
the
third
circuit’s
direction
to
district
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
and
he
says
the
proceedings
should
be
deferred
until
the
conclusion
of
the
related
criminal
proceedings
or
until
a
running
of
all
applicable
statute
limitations
and
if
that
is
refused
and
it
is
arbitrary
it
will
be
cured
by
the
appellate
court.
so
i
think
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
issue
in
this
case
and
i
mentioned
that
merely
to
meet
a
point
raised
by
the
respondent.
well,
for
the
reasons
i
have
discussed,
the
united
states
ask
that
this
case
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
trial.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
this
is
entirely
an
excise
tax
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
there
is
none
now
that
i
know
of.
that
is
the
--
if
a
question
was
one
levied,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
the
interest
split.
our
brief
discusses
that
and
i
think
there
is
a
split
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
the
--
some
of
them,
as
our
brief
suggests,
have
invoked
the
dictum
in
silverthorne,
that
the
essence
of
that
provision
is
that
--
not
that
evidence
shall
not
--
so
acquired
shall
not
be
used
before
the
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
these
are
not
entirely
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
tax
cases
and
furthermore
there
is
no
practice
the
suarez
case
for
example
which
is
cited
in
footnote
14,
at
page
37
of
our
brief,
is
a
case
involving
–
it
is
a
tax
case,
but
it
was
a
police
raid
and
it
was
not
a
--
it
was
not
quite
this
case
in
that
sense,
but
it
was
not
a
case
of
the
internal
revenue
service
formatting
the
raid
or
carrying
on
itself
and
there
was
no
indication
that
we
are
tired
of
an
internal
revenue
service
practice,
none
of
that
at
all.
i
think
these
are
cases
which
are
badly
reasoned
and
the
--
in
the
same
footnote,
we
gave
the
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
go
the
other
way
and
i
think
the
--
about
a
recent
cases.
i
should
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
wish
to
clarify
one
point.
the
government
thought
that
a
summary
judgment
had
been
entered
here
because
on
pages
10a
and
11a
of
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
have
reproduced
the
district
court’s
order
which
enters
judgment.
the
government
had
not
thought
that
there
was
a
trial
because
that
the
records
shows
only
a
discussion
of
the
legal
point
and
we
thought
that
the
respondent
had
had
not
have
an
opportunity
to
put
in
his
evidence.
now,
the
district
court
does
refer
to
this
on
page
9a
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
as
a
trial
and
if
respondent
were
correct
about
--
is
correct
about
this
and
if
we
should
prevail
here,
then
the
proper
disposition
would
be
to
remand
for
the
entry
of
a
judgment
for
the
united
states.
but
i
think
the
situation
is
ambiguous
and
should
the
government
prevail,
i
think
the
remand
should
be
for
a
disposition
by
the
trial
court.
let
the
trial
court
decide
whether
or
not
respondent
had
a
chance
to
put
his
evidence
in.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
of
the
tax
claim,
precisely
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
if
there
are
no
questions,
that
concludes
our
presentation
mr.
chief
justice.
