justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
are
you
asking
for
here
only
damages,
any
other
kind
of
relief?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mean
there
is
an
absolute
immunity
defense
available
to
him
under
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
for
this
prosecutor
it
would
be
an
absolute
immunity,
would
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
it.
what
is
a
quasi-judicial
immunity,
let
us
say
an
absolute
immunity,
is
that
your
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
farrell,
if
i
understood
you
to
suggest
your
colloquy
of
mr.
justice
white
that
where
the
prosecutor
to
bribe
a
witness
to
give
a
certain
testimony,
he
might
be
subject
to
a
suit
for
damages?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
tell
me
then,
but
i
gather
what
is
relied
on
here
are
the
judicial
immunity
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
suppose
a
judge
takes
money
and
this
actually
happened
as
you
know,
to
sell
decisions,
he
is
immune,
is
he
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
he
is
immune
from
damages
for
having
said?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
in
any
event
you
would
make
a
distinction
between
the
absolute
immunity
for
a
judge
who
sells
a
decision
and
which
is
absolute
and
would
suggest
it
may
not
be
absolute
in
the
case
of
prosecutor
who
bribes
a
witness
to
give
certain
testimonies,
is
that
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
know,
but
what
about
in
terms
of
absolute
immunity?
i
thought
you
said
to
justice
white
earlier
there
would
be
an
absolute
immunity
for
the
prosecutor
who
bribed
the
witness
to
get
testimony?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
proving
that,
do
i
get
to
be
put
to
jail
by
that
witness?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
solicitor
general
i
gather
that
the
question
i
put
to
mr.
(inaudible)
a
judge
himself
a
decision
would
have
the
absolute
immunity,
would
he
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
i
mean
from
the
damage
suit.
do
you
agree
with
him
that
perhaps
one
prosecutor
who
bribes
the
witness,
would
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
carries
the
absolute
immunity
even
to
that
prosecutor?
