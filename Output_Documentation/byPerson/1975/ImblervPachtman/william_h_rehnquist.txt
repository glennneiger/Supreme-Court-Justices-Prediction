justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
also
have
opinions
going
the
other
way,
do
we
not,
from
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nonetheless
you
know
you
can
weigh
the
opinions
the
way
you
want,
but
what
you
have
is
seven
justices
of
the
supreme
court
unanimously
finding
against
your
client
on
this
point.
one
single
federal
district
judge
upsetting
the
thing
and
three
judges
of
the
ninth
circuit
affirming?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
know
what
the
vote
was
in
our
conference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
the
test?
is
that
how
you
find
out
what
the
vote
was
in
our
conference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
not
just
good
faith
be
pretty
much
a
question
for
the
jury
in
every
case
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
under
review,
subjective
state
of
mind?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you
would
have
a
jury
issue
under
your
view
of
what
should
be
the
rule
in
almost
every
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
should
think
that
is
the
last
quotation
you
would
want
to
make
in
support
of
your
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
has
had
his
preliminary
hearing
where?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
the
respondent
bound
by
that
proceeding?
he
was
not
a
party
to
it,
was
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
use
this
testimony
against
him
then
i
presume,
but
if
he
is
not
a
party,
i
would
think
he
would
not
be
bound?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
district
judge
has
been
reversed
no
less
than
three
times
by
this
court
since
i
have
been
a
member
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
not
good
faith
almost
always
a
question
for
the
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
would
not
eliminate
any
case
really
by
your
pre-trial
hearing,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
mentioned
that
about
three
times
during
your
argument
mr.
hanson.
are
you
suggesting
that
these
would
not
be
subject
to
the
normal
standards
of
pre-trial
hearings
and
the
right
of
jury
trial,
uncontested
issues
of
the
fact
that
we
would
just
carve
out
some
exception
to
the
federal
rules
and
civil
procedure
for
these
kind
of
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay
now.
you
say
outside
of
a
discretionary
act.
now,
supposing
i
am
a
prosecutor.
during
the
trial
i
am
confronted
with
the
defense
counsel’s
demand
for
brady
material
and
i
make
the
best
judgment
i
can.
i
act
in
good
faith.
i
turn
out
to
be
wrong,
the
appellate
court
reverses
me.
now,
is
that
a
discretionary
act
on
my
part?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
even
the
knowing
use
of
perjured
testimony,
you
can
end
up
with
the
finding
to
that
effect
on
the
basis
if
hindsight,
but
the
question
in
the
eyes
of
a
prosecutor
maybe,
is
this
witness
lying
or
is
he
not?
can
i
consistently
with
my
constitutional
requirements
put
him
on
the
stand?
those
things
do
not
always
look
black
and
white
at
the
time
they
happen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
upheld
the
prosecutor’s
position
on
the
basis
of
that
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
case
of
a
prosecutor,
you
have
some
corrective
devices
available
other
than
a
1983
action,
do
you
not?
you
have
the
supervision
of
the
trial
judge,
your
right
of
appeal
in
the
criminal
case
and
your
right
to
habeas
corpus
which
you
took
advantage
of
here.
that
does
not
give
you
money
damages,
but
it
does
offer
you
a
root
by
which
you
can
correct
the
alleged
prosecutorial
misconduct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
really
has
never
been
acquitted
by
a
jury,
has
he?
the
state
just
decided
not
to
retry
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
privately
retained
defense
counsel
an
agent
of
the
state
for
purposes
of
1983?.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
familiar
with
the
ninth
circuit’s
holding
in
ronan
against
robichaud?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
a
case
where
the
prosecutor
had
apparently
collaborator,
who
was
alleged
he
collaborated
kind
of
third
degree
methods
in
interrogating
a
witness,
would
you
extend
absolute
immunity
that
far?
