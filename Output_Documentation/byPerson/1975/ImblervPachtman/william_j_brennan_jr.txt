justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
farrell,
i
am
curious.
all
of
the
briefs
including
the
amicus
briefs
cite
any
number
or
federal
court
decisions
largely
of
course
appeal,
that
address
this
question
of
prosecutorial
immunity
on
the
1983,
but
none
of
you
seems
to
accept
one
of
them
and
cites
in
arguing
the
case,
refers
to
any
state
cases
that
deal
with
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
have
been
some
decisions
of
state
courts
that
1983
actions
are
maintainable
in
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
not
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
us
to
have
a
survey
of
what
the
state
decisions
are
on
the
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
state
law
generally,
do
you
know?
i
know
there
are
couple
of
citations
to
pierson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
generally,
you
do
not
cite
anything
to
support
it,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
should
you
help
us
find
it,
you
are
referring
this
to
us
and
having
us
look
at
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
notice
a
number
of
these
cases
cited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
be
interested
in
what
is
happening
in
illinois,
in
new
york,
in
new
jersey
and
other
places
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
circuit
was
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
farrell,
only
damages
are
requested
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
declaratory
and
injunctive
reliefs
are
requested,
is
your
theory
of
immunity
still
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
there
has
always
been
attention
between
state
courts,
i
can
say
from
personal
experience
in
federal
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
nothing
new
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest
on
the
issue
that
we
are
dealing
with
today.
i
do
not
see
that
an
attention
helps
us
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
so
called
an
investigative
function,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
at
least
three
circuits
have
thought
there
was
a
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
solicitor
general,
i
know
that
your
brief
has
given
us
a
rather
comprehensive
review
of
all
the
federal
court
decisions
addressed
in
this
question,
but
you
made
no
reference
to
lower
or
any
state
court
decisions,
is
there
any
reason
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
is
a
good
deal
of
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
familiar
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
not
let
me
hold?
