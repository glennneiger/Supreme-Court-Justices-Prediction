mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
is
interested
in
this
case
because
the
outcome
of
it
will
quite
likely
affect
the
scope
of
the
immunity
for
federal
prosecutors
and
may
in
some
sense
control
it.
i
think
the
main
points
have
been
well
canvassed
by
counsel.
the
problem
of
harassment
that
may
occur
to
a
prosecutor
i
think
is
illustrated
in
some
ways
by
this
case
because
we
have
seven
judges
in
the
california
supreme
court
who
thought
the
conduct
here
did
not
deny
the
petitioner
his
constitutional
rights
and
we
have
two
federal
courts
who
thought
it
did
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
when
judges
differ
that
substantially
about
the
nature
of
this
conduct
and
what
it
did
to
petitioner’s
rights.
it
is
fair
to
say
that
nobody
can
be
confident
of
the
outcome
of
the
jury
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
was
not
going
to
the
merits
in
the
sense
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
meant
to
imply
that
either
court
was
right
or
wrong.
i
have
been
merely
illustrating
the
degree
of
uncertainty
that
exists
in
all
of
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
meant
to
go
that
point
mr.
chief
justice
because
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
sure
there
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
in
that
case
i
will
not
pursue
the
point.
i
was
trying
to
put
it
somewhat
differently,
but
it
is
not
what
my
main
point,
in
any
event
i
will
pass
it.
what
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
the
conceptual
framework
of
the
absolute
immunity
and
the
qualified
immunity
and
why
i
think
this
particular
process
requires
an
absolute
immunity.
petitioner’s
counsel
objected
to
this
being
called
a
quasi-judicial
immunity
because
the
prosecutor
is
an
executive
branch
officer,
but
i
think
there
is
no
anomaly
there.
the
categorization
does
not
come
from
the
equation
of
which
branch
of
government
you
are
employed
by.
it
comes
from
the
process
in
which
you
are
engaged,
the
nature
of
the
process
in
which
one
is
engaged.
this
happens
to
be
executive
branch
employee
who
is
intimately
involved
in
a
judicial
process
and
it
is
the
appropriate
immunity
for
--
is
shaped
by
the
needs
of
the
process
and
i
think
that
is
why
this
is
called
the
quasi-judicial
immunity
and
that
is
why
that
absolute
immunity
which
adheres
to
judges
has
properly
been
held
to
adhere
to
prosecutors
in
yaselli
against
goff.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
see
mr.
justice
marshall
that
should
a
defense
counsel
suborn
in
perjury
that
he
would
be
liable
to
anyone
in
a
damage
action.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
assume
he
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
assume
he
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
people
engaged
in
this
process
are
–-
pardon
me.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
no,
no.
the
question
was
in
general.
can
the
defense
counsel
be
regarded
as
performing
a
quasi-judicial
function
and
within
the
terminology
which
we
are
using
now,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
now
of
course
there
would
be
not
state
action.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
under
the
1983.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
something
of
that
sort.
we
are
saying
that
this
nature
of
the
process
defines
the
immunity
of
the
judge
and
of
the
prosecutor
and
indeed
that
the
prosecutor’s
immunity
is
symmetrical
with
the
judge’s
immunity.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
not
sure
it
is
state
action
mr.
chief
justice.
i
had
not
addressed
the
question
of
the
state
action
of
a
public
defender.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
them.
it
is
merely
a
question
whether
this
idea
of
quasi-judicial
aspect
covered
defense
counsel
as
well,
i
think
as
a
general
concept
it
does,
but
i
think
that
is
nothing
do
with
this
case
and
the
point
i
wish
to
make
here
is
that
i
think
the
immunity
which
a
prosecutor
has
is
symmetrical
with
that
which
the
judge
has
because
they
are
both
essential
to
the
judicial
process.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
ended
on
the
note
that
the
immunity
was
defined
by
the
process
and
for
that
reason
that
the
prosecutor’s
immunity
was
appropriate
of
the
same
size
as
the
judge’s
immunity
and
that
would
mean
that
a
case
parallel
to
this
would
be
the
case
of
a
judge
who
was
reversed
for
misconduct
of
the
trial
during
which
he
had
denied
a
litigant
his
constitutional
rights.
i
take
it
that
pierson
against
ray
and
yaselli
against
goff
--
pierson
against
ray
means
that
that
judgment
nevertheless
would
have
absolute
immunity.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
correct.
the
judge
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
with
malice.
we
also
have
indicted
judges
from
time
to
time
and
so
that
would
be
analog
to
this
case
and
i
think
if
that
judge
would
have
an
absolute
immunity
as
indeed
i
think
he
would
from
a
damage
suit
i
think
so
a
prosecutor
should,
then
i
think
the
perception
or
the
difference
is
between
the
governor’s
decision
making
range
and
what
is
at
stake
here
is
what
the
counsel
difference
between
this
case
and
pierson
against
ray
and
the
case
of
scheuer
against
rhodes
and
the
greatest
difference
which
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
from
the
damage
suit
i
believe
yes
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
willing
to
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
great
deal
of
what
prosecutor
does,
it
is
done
outside
of
the
courtroom
and
i
do
not
really
see
that
in
the
performance
of
his
prosecutorial
function
that
makes
that
much
difference
whether
he
happens
to
be
standing
on
the
hall
or
in
his
office
or
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
may
be.
there
has
been
a
doctrine
of
absolute
immunity
for
other
executive
officers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
but
i
think
that
scheuer
indicates
and
wood
against
strickland
indicates
some
difference
and
i
am
suggesting
for
executive
officers
at
least
in
the
state
context
and
i
am
suggesting
that
difference
between
that
case
in
pierson
against
ray
or
yaselli
against
goff
is
justified
by
the
difference
in
the
process
and
one
of
those
differences
as
is,
as
we
said
in
the
scheuer
opinion,
i
am
quoting
from
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
that
where
they
not
judicial
review
in
the
damage
suit,
there
would
be
no
way
to
test
the
governor’s
performance
in
a
courtroom
and
defy
another
state
governor
would
be
the
constitution
and
not
the
constitution
by
the
supreme
law.
that
is
not
true
here.
a
prosecutor’s
behavior
is
testable
in
the
courtroom
before
the
jury,
it
is
testable
on
appeal,
it
is
testable
on
collateral
attack
and
indeed
it
is
testable
ultimately
if
one
gets
to
that
stage
upon
a
petition
for
commutation
of
sentence
or
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
believe
i
am
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
are
cases
that
i
think
we
need
not
reach
for
purposes
of
this
case
in
which
a
prosecutor
does
what
is
regarded
as
essentially
a
police
function,
as
in
directing
a
raid
or
interrogating
a
witness
and
it
is
possible
to
draw
that
line.
i
would
be
hesitant
to
draw
it
very
easily
because
the
connection
between
what
he
is
going
to
do
in
the
courtroom
and
what
he
does
outside
the
courtroom
is
so
close.
there
may
be
cases
in
which
that
line
can
be
drawn.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
there
may
be.
i
do
not
think
we
need
to
address
that
distinction
for
the
purposes
of
today’s
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
becomes
a
qualified
immunity
i
believe.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
is
the
executive.
i
mean,
a
governor
who
directs
an
executive
officer?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
to
prosecute
that
would
be
somewhat
difficult
case
because
at
that
point
the
governor
i
take
it
is
exercising
his
function
to
make
sure
the
laws
are
executed
in
the
sense.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
is
acting
like
a
prosecutor.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
i
think
is
true,
but
we
are
talking
about
a
governor
calling
out
the
national
guard.
we
are
talking
about
the
situation
in
which
there
is
no
way
to
get
judicial
review
of
that
action,
if
there
is
not
a
1983
suit
available.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
i
believe
true
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
is
quite
true
mr.
chief
justice.
it
may
be
that
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
was
somewhat
tempered
by
my
knowledge
that
the
attorney
general
can
direct
prosecution.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
the
federal
system
and
our
interest
is
of
course
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
may,
will
be.
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
state.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
i
think
also
it
is
true
that
judicial
process
that
we
are
trying
to
protect
with
this
kind
of
immunity
is
a
more
vulnerable
process.
it
is
quite
true
that
prosecutors
have
to
bring
many
cases
and
they
have
antipathy
from
many
defendants
and
there
are
categories
of
defendants
who
if
they
were
able
to
sue
would
do
their
best
to
bring
the
process
to
a
halt
or
at
least
the
damage
of
the
process
by
bringing
actions.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
we
did
not
justice
brennan
because
we
think
at
least
as
to
the
federal
prosecutor’s
immunity
it
is
governed
by
federal
law.
now,
perhaps
i
do
not
know
if
these
gentlemen
wish
to
file
the
brief,
i
thought
you
were
asking
about
this
morning.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
shall
i
ask
this
gentlemen
if
they
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
is
interested
more
than
1983.
he
is
interested
in
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
we
have
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
alright
i
think.
(voice
overlap)
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
prosecutor
has
to
establish
his
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
unanimous
jury.
should
he
be
reversed
on
appeal
for
having
done
something
or
be
attacked
collaterally,
he
will
be
sued
under
a
standard
by
which
a
majority
of
the
jury
may
hold
him
liable
on
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
i
think
that
is
bound
to
have
a
deterred
effect
as
the
prosecutor
decides
whether
or
not
to
go
forward
with
the
case.
and
finally,
i
think
it
may
be
worth
noting
that
i
think
it
is
true
that
some
courts
would
be
a
little
loathe
in
a
close
case
to
decide
if
the
defendant
had
been
denied
his
constitutional
rights
by
a
prosecutor
if
that
court
knew
that
by
doing
so
he
was
exposing
the
prosecutor
to
a
lawsuit
for
damages.
it
is
not
all
clear
that
removing
the
absolute
immunity
would
help
the
defendants.
it
might
in
fact
hurt
some
defendants
on
their
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
in
any
event
for
these
reasons
we
think
the
absolute
immunity
which
a
court
has,
a
judge
has,
and
a
juror
has
properly
belongs
to
a
prosecutor
as
well.
there
are
other
sanctions,
other
safeguards
in
the
judicial
process
not
available
elsewhere
and
for
that
reason
we
thank
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
