justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
in
this
case,
you
have
a
finding
by
a
court,
a
competent
court,
in
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
that
is
your
case,
what
do
you
want
to
extend
it
beyond
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
point
i
assume
is
that
where
there
has
been
a
finding
in
a
court
on
a
habeas
corpus
that
the
conduct
was
thus
and
so
that
at
least
entitles
you
to
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
are
not
abandoning
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
also
said
that
even
if
the
actual
malicious
immunity
was
there,
you
do
not
want
to
adapt
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
sure
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
were
not
there,
how
do
you
know
what
judge
traynor
had?
i
assume
when
you
have
passed
all
the
judgment
on
that
you
argued
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
yours
is
all
based
on
reading
opinion
that
brought
this
conclusion
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
point
is
i
do
not
think
you
need
to
characterize
a
judge’s
actions
in
order
to
win
your
lawsuit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
absolute
if
he
is
found
perjury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
he
is
a
prosecutor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
crime,
is
that
a
crime
in
california?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
be
convicted
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
could
not
be
liable
in
civil
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
if
he
is
convicted
of
it,
would
he
then
be
liable
in
a
civil
action?.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
person
that
can
do
that
in
california
is
upon
perjury
get
away
with
it
is
a
prosecutor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
else?
that
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
even
outside
the
courtroom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
the
so?
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
nitpicking
as
to
whether
man
voluntarily
put
himself
in
an
insane
asylum
or
already
he
was
thrown
in,
is
that
not
nitpicking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
am
saying
is
you
get
into
the
mugs
and
i
did
not
know
the
mugs
were
for
photos?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
or
are
you
going
to
give
up
your
absolute
immunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
would
not
open
that
up.
this
case
would
be
limited
as
i
see
the
facts,
a
fact
where
a
federal
district
court
has
held
an
habeas
corpus,
does
do
and
the
court
of
appeal
affirmed
and
this
court
has
denied
certiorari?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
be
limited
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
understood
(voice
overlap)
are
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
not
what
the
county
really
emphasizes
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
county
would
have
some
money
to
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
know
the
habeas
was
going
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
could
tell
him,
could
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
might?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
telling
me
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
would
not
normally
get
in
touch
with
the
office
that
prosecuted
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
committee
prosecutor’s
office,
the
office
that
prosecuted
the
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
actual
trial
of
the
case,
i
still
have
not
got
it
clear
in
my
mind
the
difference
between
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
as
to
who
is
a
quasi-judicial
officer.
this
is
during
the
trial
in
asking
questions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
is
he
a
quasi-judicial
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
is
no
difference.
he
also
is
a
quasi
judicial
officer?
