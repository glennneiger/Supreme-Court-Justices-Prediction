justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
sometime
after
petitioner's
conviction
of
murder,
the
california
prosecuting
attorney,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
reveals
a
newly
discovered
evidence,
relying
in
part
on
this
evidence,
the
petition
of
ultimately
one
is
released
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
he
thereafter
brought
this
section
1983
action,
alleging
that
respondent
in
the
prosecution
had
used
false
testimony
and
also
has
suppressed
material
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
district
court,
held
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
absolutely
immune
from
a
suit
for
damages
under
section
1983
for
action
taken
within
the
scope
of
his
prosecutorial
duties.
under
the
common
law
a
prosecutor
alone
has
enjoyed
complete
immunity
from
suits
for
malicious
prosecution.
it
also
has
settled
out
that
a
judge
is
immune
from
section
1983
damage
claims,
based
on
action
taken
within
the
scope
of
his
judicial
periods.
the
same
considerations
of
public
policy
that
underlie
these
rules,
apply
to
1983
suite
against
a
prosecutor.
although
the
immunity
doctrine
leaves
the
wrong
criminal
defender,
without
civil
redress,
a
different
rule
would
deceive
a
broader
public
interest.
allying
such
suits
would
prevent
the
vigorous
and
fearless
performance
of
the
prosecutor's
duties
that
is
essential
to
the
proper
functioning
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
had
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
