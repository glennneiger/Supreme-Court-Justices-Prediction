mr.
hanson,
excuse
me
chief
justice.
mr.
hanson,
all
the
merits
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
may
have
something
to
do
with
this
case?
the
primary
and
cardinal
question
here
is
the
extent
of
the
immunity,
if
any,
of
prosecutors,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
know
that
you
took
a
back
up
position
that
even
though
there
might
be
immunity
in
the
normal
situation,
at
least
there
should
be
an
exemption
when
a
federal
court
has
found
that
there
are
correct
and
that
there
was
a
knowing
used
of
perjured
testimony,
but
the
first
and
basic
question
is
the
immunity
of
the
prosecutor,
quite
a
part
from
the
merits
of
this
case,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
what
provision
in
the
sixth
amendment
are
you
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
the
prosecutor
is
an
executive.
there
is
no
gain
in
saying
that?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
executive
branch?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
attorney
general
of
california
have
any
power
or
jurisdiction
over
the
local
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
--
you
started
to
say
earlier
that
the
quasi-judicial
has
two
meanings.
you
never
were
able
to
elaborate
or
finish
that
because
i
think
you
were
interrupted?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
us
what
your
concept
was
at
the
first
meeting,
a
first
meeting
somebody
like
a
magistrate
or
somebody,
at
least
at
that
time
performs
what
seem
to
be
judicial
functions
and
duties?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
first
one.
justice
potter
stewart
supporting
personnel
in
the
courtroom?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
he
was
a
public
defender,
publicly
paid?
justice
potter
stewart
the
analog
would
be
a
judge
who
had
done
so
deliberately
and
intentionally
and
knowingly?
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
because
of
ignorance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
they,
do
those
decisions
say
that
he
then
has
the
immunity
of
a
policeman
or
he
has
no
immunity
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
the
immunity
of
a
policeman
if
he
is
acting
like
a
policeman?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
the
cases
say?
i
believe
so.
but
the
one
thing
i
want
to
stress
here
is
that
in
this
case,
unlike
the
case
of
a
governor
or
school
official,
the
prosecutorâ€™s
action
is
subject
to
repeated
review
and
repeated
collateral
attack
which
would
not
be
true
if
the
governor
in
scheuer
against
rhodes,
will
not
be
true
if
the
school
officials
in
wood
against
strickland
were
not
for
their
not
having
absolute
immunity.
it
has
been
mentioned
that
besides
the
other
safeguards
for
the
defendant,
there
are
sanctions
available
against
a
prosecutor
which
are
not
available
against
the
governor
such
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
decisions
would
be
construing
1983.
the
only
reason
we
have
this
case
is
because
it
involves
a
federal
question
of
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
any
state
can
do
whatever
he
wants
about
this
it
is
a
matter
of
its
own
state
tort
law?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
true
in
1983?
