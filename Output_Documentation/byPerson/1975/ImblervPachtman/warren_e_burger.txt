chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-5435,
imbler
against
pachtman.
mr.
hanson
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
recall
correctly
that
this
case
came
before
the
california
supreme
court
twice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three
times?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
was
it
not
--
was
it
treated
to
in
any
degree
at
all
in
the
final
disposition
by
the
california
supreme
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
justice
traynor
write
both
of
the
opinions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
two
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
case
that
have
decided
this
issue
against
the
theory
that
you
are
arguing
have
put
it
on
the
basis
that
not
of
the
risk
of
having
a
damage
verdict,
but
against
the
dangers
and
the
risks
involved
in
having
a
prosecutor
spend
his
time
defending
the
suits
instead
of
carrying
out
his
function
of
prosecuting
cases,
is
that
not
the
choice
that
has
been
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
then
apparently
equate
prosecutors
and
all
other
executive
officers
as
being
on
the
same
level?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
a
governor
calling
up
the
national
guard
is
exercising
a
quasi-judicial
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
might
be
more
of
them
if
you
prevail
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
chief
justice
traynor
ignored
what
you
say
is
the
heart
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
their
functions
are
quasi-judicial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
easy
for
us
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
to
retry
a
man
after
10
or
12
years
following
the
alleged
murder,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
in
a
federal
case
necessarily?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you.
mr.
farrell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
now
of
the
witness
whose
testimony
is
alleged
to
have
been
presented
improperly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
goes
to
the
merits,
however,
does
it
not,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
does
not
go
to
the
main
issue
of
the
risk
of
harassment
of
prosecutors
in
the
diversion
of
their
time
from
their
basic
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
we
say
that
the
public
defender
is
paid
by
the
public,
are
you
sure
that
that
makes
that
state
action
in
light
of
your
definition
that
it
is
not
the
category
or
class
in
which
we
put
in
the
function
that
he
performs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
do
not
need
to
worry
about
the
defense
counsel
here
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
oâ€™clock
mr.
solicitor
general.
[lunch
break]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
true
that
in
most
of
the
states,
neither
the
governor
of
the
state
nor
the
attorney
general
has
any
final
control
over
the
actions
of
a
prosecutor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mthe
governor
can
remove
or
suspend
the
prosecutor
temporarily
for
clause,
but
overwhelmingly
the
prosecutor
elected
in
a
particular
jurisdiction
is
autonomous.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
federal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-5435
imbler
v.
pachtman
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
