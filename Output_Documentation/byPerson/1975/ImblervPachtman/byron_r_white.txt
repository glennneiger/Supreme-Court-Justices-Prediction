justice
byron
r.
white
were
the
acts
involved
in
this
case
for
the
prosecutor
arguably
criminal
under
california
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
knowing
use
of
perjured
testimony,
if
that
is
a
crime
under
california
law,
then
prosecutor
is
exposed
to
criminal
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
is
it
clear
that
the
knowing
use
of
perjured
testimony
is
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
damage
suit
under
california
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
this
prosecutor
be
sued
for
what
he
did
under
the
california
law
for
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently
then
the
question
of
immunity
under
california
law
is
not
settled?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
not
a
suit
against
the
sovereign.
this
is
the
suit
against
the
prosecutor
personally?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
under
california
law
there
is
a
damage
remedy
against
this
prosecutor
if
you
can
show
he
knowingly
used
perjured
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
out
of
state
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
suing
the
prosecutor?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
under
the
california
statutes
or
the
california
common
law
that
a
prosecutor
is
absolutely
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
prosecutor,
you
say
he
is
protected
if
he
is
suborns
perjury,
if
he
bribes
the
witness
to
testify
in
a
certain
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
is
absolutely
immune
under
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
he
is
not
immune
from
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
what
if
he
is
in
the
courtroom,
what
if
he
is
cross-examining
the
witness
and
he
just
loses
his
temper
and
he
goes
and
punches
the
witness
in
the
nose?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
is
not
just
within
the
normal
balance
of
prosecutorial
behavior?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now
the
same
prosecutor
though,
the
same
prosecutor
puts
a
witness
on
the
stand
knowing
he
is
perjuring
himself.
he
knows
it.
now,
and
upon
proof
of
that
the
conviction
is
going
to
be
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
is
a
deprivation
of
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
within
the
normal
bounds
of
prosecutorial
conduct
to
put
on
the
stand
knowing
perjured
testimony
any
more
than
punching
the
fellow
in
the
nose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
did
not
say
that
is
normal.
is
it
within
the
bounds
of
a
prosecutorial
behavior?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
threaten
the
witness,
you
either
testify
this
way
or
i
will
prosecute
your
mother
or
your
brother
or
somebody,
what
about
that?
then
you
ask
the
question
in
the
courtroom
and
the
witness
responds
exactly
the
way
you
told
him
to
respond
under
this
threat.
now
is
the
prosecutor
absolutely
immune?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
he
brings
--
there
is
lawsuit
going
afterwards
for
convicting
me
from
using
false
testimony,
a
knowing
use
of
false
testimony
which
was
obtained
by
a
threat
issued
by
the
prosecutor?
now
that
is
a
1983
suit,
precisely
this
kind
of
a
suit
and
the
plea
is
of
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
then
that
we
really
should
divide
prosecutorial
behavior
in
the
various
categories,
at
least
two,
some
that
are
really
part
of
the
prosecutorial
acts
and
some
are
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
someone
else
pays
the
prosecutor
to
bring
the
prosecution
and
the
prosecutor
says
well
have
to
give
me
some
testimony
too.
so
he
is
paid
to
bring
the
prosecution
and
he
carries
it
out
in
the
courtroom
giving
what
he
knows
is
absolutely
false
testimony,
again,
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
taking
of
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
taking
the
money
resulted
in
his
bringing
the
prosecution
resulted
in
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
(voice
overlap)
somebody
damage,
he
will
not
be
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
mr.
solicitor
general
the
decision
the
court
affirmed
in
goff
v.
yaselli
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
saw
no
difference
between
judges
and
other
executive
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
yaselli
has
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
to
executive
officer
who
directs
a
prosecutor
to
prosecute?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
acting
like
the
prosecutor?
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
the
prosecutor
is
acting
like
a
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
if
they
can,
it
often
happens
in
the
states
they
nevertheless
listen?
justice
byron
r.
white
pierson
against
ray
and
those
cases
called
on
the
historic
privilege
under
common
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
so
the
question
is
that
--
that
may
be
common
law
may
be
of
some
relevance
in
the
various
states?
