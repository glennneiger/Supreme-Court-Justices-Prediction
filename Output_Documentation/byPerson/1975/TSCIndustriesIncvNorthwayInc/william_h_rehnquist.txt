it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
maybe
one
common
element.
although,
perhaps
you
may
not
see
it
the
way
between
the
prior
case
and
yours
and
that
is
–
an
inquiry
perhaps
is
to
–
what
is
the
question
of
fact
and
what
is
the
question
of
law.
is
there
any
generally
accepted
standard
in
the
courts
of
appeal
or
in
this
court
as
to
whether
a
question
of
materiality
such
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
passed
on
here
is
generally
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
mclaren’s
holding
was
in
a
fact
that
it
was
reasonably
debatable
so
he
denied
summary
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
this
if
i
may
mr.
reese
on
the
same
kind
of
fact
law
distinction,
is
it
not
that
the
average
juror
probably
in
his
good
position
to
evaluate
what
is
the
first
thing
that
will
come
to
a
stockholder’s
mind
as
the
average
lawyer
or
the
average
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
that
is
so,
would
not
materiality
normally
be
a
question
of
fact
for
the
finder
of
fact
rather
than
the
question
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
regard
that
that
is
an
entirely
convincing
answer
because
certainly
in
a
typical
negligence
case
or
typical
common
law
fraud
case,
you
can
have
a
stipulated
documents,
admitted
facts
and
it
still
regard
as
a
question
for
the
trial
of
fact
was
the
man
negligent?
was
it
material?
was
it
misleading?
why
should
not
the
same
principles
obtain
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
questions
of
fraud
in
a
fraud
case
to
the
jury
thinking
that
properly
charged
as
they
should
be,
they
will
be
able
to
make
the
assessment
for
themselves.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
getting
back
to
mills
for
a
moment
mr.
reese
i
sent
forth
and
i
noticed
that
at
least
as
i
read
footnote
four
on
page
381
of
justice
harlan’s
opinion,
he
says
that
the
respondents
asked
the
court
to
review
the
conclusion
of
the
lower
courts
that
a
proxy
statement
was
misleading
and
a
material
effect
but
this
court
refused
to
pass
on
it
because
it
was
not
raised
by
the
petitioner.
is
that
consistent
with
your
answer
earlier
that
the
court
must
have
decided
that
the
statement
was
materialism
matter
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
court
did
not
review
that
holding
in
mills.
