justice
byron
r.

there
was
this
significant
propensity
test
which
the
court
of
appeals
have
rejected.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
thought
that
they
suggested
a
significant
propensity
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
they
did
not
embrace,
they
might
have
test
this
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
agreed
with
whatever
it
is
the
sec
proposes,
assume
we
agreed
with
it
and
that
it
is
different
than
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
uses.
what
would
we
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
vacate
and
remand,
we
used
the
right
test
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
says
that
under
any
test
including
its
test,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
used
the
wrong
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
opposed
the
standard
which
you
just
recited.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
at
least
purported
to
follow
that
rule
that
you
stated
from
mills.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
thought
they
were
differing
whether
they
were
or
not.
but
at
least
they
thought
they
were
differing
with
the
second
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
different
with
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
answer
that
a
defensive
no
causation
would
never
work?
if
someone
said
that
look
i
just
did
not,
let
us
say
the
defendant
said
i
am
going
to
prove
that
there
was
no
reliance,
no
causation;
the
judge
should
say
that
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
trial
courts?
do
you
know
what
they
say
in
that
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
if
it
rejects
the
statement
that
a
reasonable
man
would
attach
importance?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
attach.
that
is
the
word
that
they
disagree
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
they
embrace
is
that
if
a
reasonable
man
might
have
or
would
there
be
a
significant
propensity
that
a
reasonable
man
would,
not
that
he
would
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
at
least
that
is
only
a
difference
i
see
in
the
test
they
propose
and
the
test
that
they
reject.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
district
judge
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
we
just
do
not
want;
just
think
judges
are
making
mistakes.
