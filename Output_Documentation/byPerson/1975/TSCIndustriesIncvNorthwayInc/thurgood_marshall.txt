justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
third
case,
74-1471,
tsc
industries
versus
northway
is
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit.
the
dispute
in
this
case
centers
about
the
acquisition
of
tsc
industries
by
national
industries.
shareholder
approval
of
the
acquisition
was
secured
to
use
of
a
joint
proxy
statement
issued
by
tsc
and
national.
northway,
a
tsc
shareholder
brought
this
suit
against
tsc
and
national
claiming
among
other
things
that
the
joint
proxy
statement
was
materially
misleading
in
violation
of
section
14a
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
section
rule
14a-9
promulgated
there
under.
northway's
claim
insofar
as
it
concerns
us
was
that
the
proxy
statement
of
certain
material
facts
relating
to
the
degree
of
national's
control
over
tsc
at
the
time
the
statement
was
issued,
and
the
favorability
of
the
terms
to
the
proposed
transaction
to
tsc
shareholders.
northway
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
on
the
issue
of
tsc's
and
national's
liability.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
certain
omissions
of
the
facts
in
the
proxy
statement
were
material
as
a
matter
of
law
and
did
not
waive
as
therefore
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
we
granted
certiorari
to
clarify
the
definition
of
was
the
material
fact
under
rule
14a-9.
a
fact
is
material
in
our
view
if
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
a
reasonable
shareholder
would
consider
it
important
in
deciding
how
to
vote.
under
that
standard
the
alleged
omission
in
this
case
were
not
as
far
as
the
record
reveals,
materially
misleading
as
a
matter
of
law
and
northway
was
not
entitled
to
summary
judgment.
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
decision
on
this
case.
