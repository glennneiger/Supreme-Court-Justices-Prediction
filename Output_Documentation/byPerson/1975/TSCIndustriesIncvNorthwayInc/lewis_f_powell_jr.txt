justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
see
any
difference
between
the
standard
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
proposed
by
judge
finley
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
i
recall
it,
presented
a
question
before
this
court
largely
as
a
factual
issue
whereas
the
question
that
we
took
the
case
to
the
side
as
stated
in
petition
related
to
the
proper
standard.
what
you
are
telling
us
now
is
that
it
really
does
not
matter
which
of
these
formulations
we
adopt
suppose
you
can
say
you
are
entitled
to
affirmance
of
the
judgment
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
adopted
the
formulation
of
the
second
circuit,
your
position
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
should
be
affirmed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
adopting
that
standardâ€”

mills
was
i
thought
was
dealing
not
with
the
question
of
materiality
but
with
the
question
of
causation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
purported
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
two
as
my
brother
rehnquist
just
pointed
out
footnote

and

of
