mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
not
try
to
maintain
the
level
of
interest
or
even
to
make
comparisons
with
respect
to
the
very
challenging
patent
case,
the
court
has
just
heard.
although
i
will
admit
my
colleagues
and
i
have
thought
of
several
ways
in
which
it
might
be
done.
i
would
also
state
that
i
have
made
arrangements
with
the
marshal
to
reserve
approximately
ten
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
case
began
in
1969,
on
december
4th
in
the
afternoon
preceding
the
december
5,
1969.
stockholder’s
meetings
of
tsc
industries,
inc.
and
national
industries,
inc.
that
was
a
swap
of
the
assets
of
tsc
for
securities
of
national
industries
which
were
passed
through
the
holders
of
the
tsc
stock.
the
issue
now,
before
this
court
is
whether
on
the
summary
judgment
record
and
under
the
limitations
of
rule
56
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
seventh
circuit
could
properly
find
that
the
omission
of
four
factual
matters
from
the
80
page
proxy
statement
was
so
serious,
so
important,
as
to
make
the
entire
proxy
statement
violative
of
rule
14a-9.
14a-9
is
a
rule
promulgated
by
the
sec
which
prohibits
the
making
of
a
misleading
or
false
statement
of
a
material
fact
and
likewise
--
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
is
rather
well
understood
and
i
think
a
question
of
materiality
is
a
question
of
fact.
it
may
become
a
question
of
law
when
the
court
finds
that
all
reasonable
men
would
agree
on
whether
a
matter
is
so
important
or
not..
and,
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
seventh
circuit
decided
these
various
questions
on
the
summary
judgment
record.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
that
is
true.
judge
mclaren
found
that
certain
important
facts
were
missing
as
to
some
matters,
he
found
that
key
facts
were
hopelessly
in
dispute
as
to
other
matters
and
therefore
he
concluded
that
the
requisite
summary
judgment
finding
could
not
be
made.
that
is
that
there
were
no
material
disputed
issues
of
fact.
he
could
not
make
such
a
finding
and
therefore
he
concluded
he
could
not
give
plaintiff
its
partial
summary
judgment
on
issue
of
liability.
plaintiff
sought
that
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
liability
solely
on
the
basis
of
rule
14
or
rather
section
14
of
the
1934
act
in
the
sec
proxy
rules
promulgated
there
under.
now,
you
are
right
mr.
justice,
i
did
not
think
of
that
connection,
but
primarily
i
think
because
the
various
courts
of
appeals
who
have
considered
the
issue
have
so
decided
it.
we
cited
a
number
of
cases
to
that
effect.
one
of
which
is
the
johns
hopkins
case,
another
which
is
rogen
against
ilikon.
when
this
case
was
filed,
the
complaint
charged
that
this
was
a
steal.
that
national
industries
inclusion
with
tsc
directors
dominated
by
national
industries
and
had
conspired
together
to
sell
off
this
valuable
business
of
tsc
at
a
grossly
inadequate
price.
however,
there
was
no
motion
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case
filed
the
day
before
the
shareholder’s
meetings.
after
two
and
a
half
years
of
discovery,
apparently,
no
fraud
could
be
found
and
established
and
the
plaintiff,
a
private
holding
company
called
northway,
inc.,
filed
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
the
issue
of
liability
only,
predicated
entirely
on
omissions
from
the
proxy
statement
with
a
single
exception
no
longer
material
here
and
charged
it
under
the
proxy
rule,
as
the
proxy
statement
was
rendered
faintly
defective
because
of
these
omissions.
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
so
did
the
district
court,
that
all
of
the
required
disclosures
had
been
made.
so
the
case
was
considered
below
on
the
question
whether
the
omissions
were
of
such
magnitude
and
such
seriousness
as
to
render
the
proxy
statement
disclosures
actually
made
on
the
required
matters
false
or
misleading.
once
again,
reference
to
rule
14a-9.
these
alleged
omissions,
serious
omissions
which
really
fell
in
to
two
areas.
one
area
related
to
the
alleged
control
which
plaintiff
said
national
had
over
tsc
and
its
influence
over
tsc
in
1969.
the
other
related
to
an
alleged
manipulation
of
prices
of
the
common
stock
of
national
industries
which
by
the
way
was
not
involved
in
the
transaction
at
all
of
the
national
securities
that
were
given
to
the
tsc
holders
where
the
national
series
b
preferred
stock
and
national
warrants.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
in
deciding
the
case
followed
almost
religiously
the
position
of
an
sec
amicus
brief
filed
with
it.
they
followed
religiously
on
the
omissions.
they
did
not
follow
the
plaintiff’s
claim
that
there
was
a
failure
to
properly
report
control
or
a
change
in
control
but
they
did
say
that
four
omissions
are
serious.
the
circuit
still
found
within
some
finding,
i
think
the
circuit
discovered
that
it
had
to
redefine
materiality
and
depart
from
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
mills
and
the
holdings
of
other
circuits
such
as
the
second
and
fifth.
and
they
went
ahead
and
defined
materiality
by
reference
to
relevancy
of
a
factual
matter
saying
that
it
was
sufficient
as
a
required
disclosure
even
if
it
was
relevant
only
for
some
stockholders.
now,
it
is
our
position
and
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
deciding
cases
support
the
position
that
rule
14
a
9
which
is
the
catch
all
is
violated
only
when
the
omitted
fact
itself
is
material
and
its
omission
makes
the
disclosures
in
the
proxy
statement
itself
false
or
misleading
in
a
material
respect.
there
are
certain
key
facts
which
we
refer
to
in
our
reply
brief
in
which
we
believe
put
this
case
in
a
context
which
makes
it
much
easier
to
analyze.
admittedly,
an
80
page
proxy
statement
is
not
an
easy
document
to
digest
or
to
analyze.
it
is
reproduced
in
full
text
in
the
appendix.
we
have
20
copies
which
do
not
meet
the
court’s
pending
rule
but
which
were
printed
for
the
shareholders
in
’69
which
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
deposit
with
the
clerk
in
the
interest
of
avoiding
eyes
drain
for
the
justices
and
their
clerks.
but,
let
us
go
back
to
the
transaction
and
see
what
actually
happened.
unlike
the
finding
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
counter
the
position
of
the
respondent
here,
this
transaction
was
actually
determined
and
defined
by
blancke
noyes.
blancke
noyes
was
an
old
tsc
director.
his
history
with
tsc
had
edited
by
several
years.
the
first
interest
that
national
industries
ever
had
in
i
think
february
of
’69.
he
is
a
partner
in
a
prestigious
investment
banking
firm
and
was
is
an
investment
banker
of
ability
himself.
both
he
and
his
wife
were
stockholders
in
tsc.
it
was
his
firm
and
he
who
analyzed
proposed
transaction
as
outlined
by
national
industries
and
its
proposal
and
said
it
was
not
good
enough.
he
made
a
counter
proposal
which
national
industries
accepted
without
further
discussion.
and
it
was
his
counter
proposal
which
became
the
exchange
ratio
in
the
transaction.
it
was
his
firm
that
handled
a
195,000-share
public
offering
in
the
spring
of
1969
and
it
was
his
firm
in
the
fall
of
that
year
that
handled
the
review
of
the
transaction
at
the
request
of
tsc
and
for
the
benefit
of
tsc
directors
and
shareholders.
now,
how
was
the
transaction
adopted
by
this
court?
once
again,
we
find
that
total
absence
of
influence
by
national
industries,
national
had
five
directors
on
this
board.none
of
those
directors
voted
on
the
october
16th
meeting,
the
three
who
were
present
abstained.
the
transaction
and
the
resolutions
in
respect
of
it
were
adopted
by
the
vote
of
four
independent
disinterested
directors,
none
of
whom
had
any
connection
with
national
here
i
refer
to
mr.
noyes,
mr.
schaeffer
who
was
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
company,
in
fact
although
not
in
title,
and
directors
deforrest
and
charthman
(ph).
now,
what
is
the
context
in
which
these
so
called
omissions
must
be
viewed?
these
ones
that
were
so
serious
that
they
should
allow
the
transaction
to
be
upset.
first
of
all,
it
is
clear
that
national
industries
was
not
in
control
of
tsc
in
the
fall
of
1969.
the
district
court
said
that
national’s
alleged
control
was
not
established.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
therefore,
on
this
summary
judgment
record,
we
say
it
is
clear
cut
that
national
is
not
in
control
of
tsc.
secondly,
the
terms
of
exchange
were
determined
not
by
national
but
by
blancke
noyes,
the
investment
banker
and
tsc
director.
certainly,
the
transaction
itself
as
far
as
tsc
is
concerned
is
initiated
as
a
result
of
resolutions
adopted
after
the
report
of
mr.
noyes
is
received
both
in
writing
and
orally
by
his
fellow
directors
at
tsc
with
all
the
national
nominees
abstaining.
now,
what
is
in
the
proxy
statement?
well,
at
appendix
267,
you
will
find
that
it
is
prominently
and
plainly
disclosed
that
national
owned
34%
of
the
tsc
stock.
that
five
of
the
ten
directors
were
national’s
nominees.
who
these
five
persons
were
and
what
their
jobs
were
at
national
industries
is
also
prominently
and
plainly
disclosed.
the
two
of
the
omissions
which
the
court
below
said
has
a
matter
of
law
on
the
summary
judgment
record
were
so
serious
that
reasonable
matter
would
not
differ
on
their
importance
related
to
the
titles
of
stanley
yarmuth
and
charles
simonelli.
yarmuth
was
the
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
national
industries
and
simonelli
was
the
director
and
executive
vice
president
of
national.
they
became
directors
of
tsc.
when
first
elected,
there
were
four
national
directors
out
of
a
total
board
of
ten.
and
yarmuth
became
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
simonelli
became
the
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
at
tsc.
yarmuth’s
position
is
chairman
of
the
board
as
per
the
bylaws
chief
executive
officer.
on
the
record
here,
it
is
plain
that
he
never
functioned
as
such.
his
affidavit
and
the
testimony
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
did
not
even
know
he
was
the
“chief
executive
officer”
until
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed
and
discovery
had
begun.
as
to
simonelli,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
transaction
was
one
in
which
the
executive
committee
of
this
board
had
no
part
whatever.
so,
his
title
as
chairman
of
an
executive
committee
on
which
he
and
yarmuth
served
along
with
a
majority
of
three
old
tsc
directors
could
not
be
very
important
to
anyone.
yet,
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
at
the
urging
of
the
sec’s
lawyers,
the
seventh
circuits
had
in
disagreement
with
the
district
judge
who
analyze
this
record
carefully
said
was
so
serious,
so
material,
so
important
that
the
proxy
statement
thereby
violated
the
basic
proxy
rule
as
to
omitted
material.
now,
we
think
that
the
seventh
circuit
arrived
at
its
misconstruction
of
14
a
9
fundamentally
in
three
steps.
first
of
all,
they
said
correctly,
we
submit
that
the
alleged
control
of
tsc
by
national
was
not
established
on
the
summary
judgment
records,
point
one.
then
they
said
that
certain
facts
are
persuasive
indicators,
and
the
phrases
there
is
persuasive
indicators
of
control.
then
they
concluded
that
the
proxy
statement
should
have
disclosed
those
suggestive
facts
which
indicated
a
“substantial
likelihood
of
control”.
in
brief,
we
suggested
the
court
that
what
they
did
was
to
confuse
suggestive
facts,
soft
information
with
the
kind
of
hard
information
which
the
legislative
history
and
the
sec’s
own
rules
tell
us
is
to
be
sought,
printed
and
understood
in
a
proxy
statement.
proxy
statements
are
supposed
to
tell
the
facts
the
way
they
are.
facts
which
are
known,
facts
which
are
ascertainable
not
matter
which
is
suggestive
of
a
fact
when
the
ultimate
fact
control
has
already
been
postulated
by
the
court
as
being
not
established
on
the
summary
judgment
record.
this
is
the
kind
and
quality
of
nitpicking,
frankly—
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
mr.
justice,
we
did
not
make
a
cross
motion.
the
reason
we
did
not
is
evident
from
judge
mclaren’s
order
in
memorandum
opinion.
there
are
frankly,
some
undisposed,
undecided,
unresolved
important
factual
questions
in
this
record
today.
there
are
questions
on
which
despite
the
fact
that
counsel
for
both
sides
are
here
in
full
battle
array,
nobody
can
answer
with
accuracy
and
completeness.
so,
we
do
not
feel
we
are
entitled
of
the
summary
judgment
and
we
certainly
submit
they
were
not.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
they
were
in
disagreement
with
judge
mclaren.
and
the
reason
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
confusing
set
of
holdings
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
gave
the
sec’s
amicus
brief
a
whole
lot
more
credit
than
it
was
due.
it
was
prepared
by
the
commission’s
lawyers
who
knew
the
least
of
all
about
the
review
of
proxy
statements.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
well,
commission
did
not
really
propose
a
test
in
its
amicus
brief
below.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
oh,
it
does
here
and
as
i
read
it—
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
that
is
true.
well
mr.
justice
white,
if
you
can
tell
exactly
what
it
is
that
the
sec
brief
in
this
court
says
this
test
should
be,
you
will
have
succeeded
where
all
of
my
colleagues
have
tried
and
failed
because
we
cannot
make
sense
out
of
it.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
they
do
suggest
significant
propensity
and
they
changed
the
wording
of
justice
harlan
in
the
famous
mills
opinion
just
a
little
bit.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
and
they
do
not
embrace
the
relevancy
idea
that
the
seventh
circuit
as
follows
and
said
relevancy
for
some
was
enough.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
i
think
you
ought
to
--
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
i
think
what
the
court
would
probably
do
would
be
to
use
these
four
omissions
as
examples
of
things
which
are
not
material
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
summary
judgment
record,
announced
a
correct
test,
and
remands
so
that
the
district
court
could
go
ahead
with
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
yes
and
the
commission
speaks
for
the
fourth—
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
the
commission
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
speaks
for
the
fourth
term.
they
speak
to
us
in
october
of
1975
and
they
tell
us
in
their
comprehensive
release
on
materiality
which
we
cite
and
quote
at
some
length
what
their
rules
are
and
what
they
follow
and
yet
their
lawyers
file
briefs
in
this
court
but
they
do
not
even
mention
that
release.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
i
think
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
confusion
that
you
have
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
confusion
evident
from
the
amicus
brief
of
the
sec
here
is
a
good
enough
for
reason
to
show
you
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
use
very
strong
language
in
formulating
your
test
of
materiality
or
your
materiality
standard
and
stated
in
such
terms
that
commission
lawyers,
plaintiff’s
lawyers,
we,
will
all
understand
you,
merely
reversing
and
remanding
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
say
it
right
when
they
said
relevancy
for
some
is
enough
will
not
do
the
trick.
i
think
frankly
some
judicial
leadership
is
called
for
here
and
we
are
hopeful
this
court
will
provide
it.
we
know
it
is
needed.
it
has
never
been
decided.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
just
a
very
limited
matter
to
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
to
say
first
of
all
that
i
think
we
deal
effectively
with
this
matter
of
the
hornblower
opinion
in
our
reply
brief
in
which
we
point
out
to
court
that
in
refrain
to
a
substantial
premium
over
current
market
values,
the
hornblower
firm
and
noyes
referred
to
a
premium
measured
by
market
prices
at
the
time,
the
exchange
ratio
was
determined
in
early
october
and
the
premium
was
certainly
there.
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
that
there
was
a
premium
of
22%
for
one
class
of
stock
and
17%
for
another
or
19%
and
17%.
secondly,
i
think
that
in
the
discussion,
insufficient
attention
has
been
given
to
the
sec
definitional
effort
in
their
brief.
admittedly,
as
the
justices
had
brought
out,
they
do
espouse
essentially
a
mills
test
at
page
4.
but
look
at
page
14,
there
they
say
they
reject
the
restatement
of
torts
test
which
is
essentially
the
same
thing
as
the
mills
test.
that
is
why
it
was
not
in
there
for
to
be
coy
or
facetious,
that
i
suggest
it
so
strongly
to
the
court
that
that
brief
be
read
with
great
care
because
it
needs
itself
coming
around
the
corner.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
if
you
go
to
page
14
of
the
sec
brief,
you
will
find
them
saying
that
they
reject
the
idea
that
the
test
of
materiality
which
the
gerstle
opinion,
the
smallwood
opinion,
the
lewis
case
and
others
have
adhered
to,
that
is
whether
or
not
a
reasonable
man
would
attach
importance
to
it
in
determining
his
choice
of
action
or
transaction—
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
i
read
--
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
let
me
suggest
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
i
am
hopeful
that
this
court
will
announce
the
standard
of
materiality
on
which
the
members
of
the
court
and
the
members
of
the
bar
can
agree
as
to
its
meaning,
whatever
your
standard
may
be.
you
are
well
able
to
phrase
and
assemble
one
for
yourselves.
i
do
not
purport
to
suggest
that
to
you.
but
i
do
suggest
that
you
got
to
stick
with
the
reasonable
shareholder
test.
and
that
you
got
to
be
extremely
careful
in
allowing
the
courts
of
appeals
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
law
that
certain
facts
are
so
critical
as
to
warrant
upsetting
an
entire
80
page
proxy
statement.
and
that
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
in
rejecting
item
after
item
after
item,
the
judgments
made
by
the
district
judge
who
went
over
this
record
with
great
care.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
on
those
nitpicking
items,
yes
your
honor
we
would.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
judges
makes
mistakes.
lawyers
make
mistakes
but
i
think
the
number
of
mistakes
made
in
this
area
can
be
substantially
diminished
once
this
court
lays
down
a
test
of
materiality
in
plain
language
that
we
can
all
read
and
perhaps
even
use
as
a
nitpicking
omissions
in
this
case
as
illustrations
of
that
which
is
not
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
n.
morency,
jr.
we
will
leave
20
copies
of
the
proxy
statement
in
full
print
with
the
clerk
mr.
chief
justice.
