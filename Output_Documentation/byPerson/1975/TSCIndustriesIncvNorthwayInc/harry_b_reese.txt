mr.
harry
b.
reese
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
questions
raised
by
the
court
during
mr.
morency’s
argument
require
for
background
perhaps
somewhat
for
exploration
of
what
these
for
admitted
documentary
uncontroverted
facts
omitted
from
the
proxy
statement
are
and
what
their
importance
maybe
in
the
decisional
process
of
the
ordinary
average
and
reasonable
shareholder.
what
is
the
first
question
which
comes
to
mind
to
a
shareholder
when
he
is
invited
to
accept
or
reject
an
exchange
of
securities?
how
will
the
value
of
my
investment
be
affected?
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
certainly
agree
and
we
believe
that
he
should
be
afforded
the
opportunity
to
make
the
decision,
to
make
the
judgments
about
whether
this
is
a
good
deal,
the
underlying
statutory
policy
as
explained
by
this
court
unanimously
in
mills
is
not
to
substitute
a
judicial
appraisal
of
the
mergers
merits
for
the
shareholder’s
actual
informed
vote.
i
think
it
is
perhaps
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
shareholder
has
the
right
to
be
wrong
to
turn
down
a
bad
deal.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
think
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
identified
in
the
course
of
the
last
argument,
matter
of
law
is
used
in
two
distinct
and
very
different
senses.
there
is
first,
the
question
of
fact,
the
question
of
what
happened,
what
occurred?
yes,
and
we
say
that
when
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
that
reasonable
minds
cannot
differ,
that
is
a
matter
of
law.
we
also
say
it
is
a
matter
of
law
when
it
is
a
question
of
law
as
here
when
there
is
no
dispute
about
what
happened.
the
facts
are
admitted,
the
question
is
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
perhaps,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
can
suggest
that
when
we
commit
a
question
of
that
kind
to
a
jury
in
a
negligence
case,
we
are
saying
our
highest
expectations
in
this
field
of
behavior
is
the
normal
behavior
of
reasonable
people.
that
is
not
the
expectation
under
the
securities
laws.
the
morales
of
the
market
place,
the
generally
accepted
standards
of
ordinary
man
had
led
us
into
a
debacle
which
led—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
the
certain
kinds
of
question
of
fraud,
common
law
deceit
are
ordinarily
submitted
to
juries.
when
we
impose
a
higher
standard,
an
equitable
standard
imposed
upon
a
fiduciary
requiring
disclosure
of
all
material
information
and
all
conflicts
of
interest,
the
question
is
decided
by
the
judge
under
traditional
equitable
principles.
the
point,
i
think
your
honor
is
perhaps
demonstrated
most
clearly
by
precedent
whether
a
fact
is
material,
is
insignificant
part
or
question
of
law
if
indeed
summary
judgment
could
never
be
granted
on
the
question
of
materiality,
then
this
court’s
unanimous
decision
in
mills
would
not
have
been
handed
down.
there
the
court
did
indeed
direct
the
entry
of
summary
judgment
on
question
of
nondisclosure
in
a
proxy
statement.
the
mills
case
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
there
is
not
the
need
for
a
revision
of
principles
which
this
court
laid
down
clearly
six
years
ago
which
it
reconfirmed
without
question
in
the
subsequent
decision
in
affiliated
ute
citizens
versus
united
states
and
i
think
that
the
question
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
well,
what
i
hoped
to
lead
in
to
was
the
question
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
decisions
in
this
case
and
its
relationship
with
for
example
the
gerstle
opinion
which
used
somewhat
different
phrasing.
in
the
first
place,
if
i
may
before
addressing
that
particular
question,
i
would
note
that
there
are
in
the
record
here,
and
in
the
briefs
offered
a
variety
of
tests
or
standards
or
measures
for
evaluation
of
materiality.
the
government
in
this
situation
has
not
i
think,
and
this
is
in
partial
response
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
has
not
adopted
the
test
that
was
rejected
by
the
seventh
circuit.
there
is
a
critical
difference.
the
government
is
speaking
of
a
significant
propensity
to
affect
the
judgment
of
a
reasonable
shareholder.
the
test,
the
significant
propensity
test
which
the
seventh
circuit
was
rejecting
was
a
significant
propensity
to
change
the
outcome
of
the
vote.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
that
court’s
experience
with
these
questions
and
the
arguments
which
were
presented
which
the
court
was
addressing
in
the
terms
in
which
those
arguments
were
made.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
in
cases
where
there
is
an
issue
of
what
occurred,
an
issue
of
fact
in
the
historic
sense,
perhaps,
that
formulation
would
be
inappropriate
instruction
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
along
with
the
determination
of
what
occurred.
but,
i
think
it
serves
both
as
a
guide
to
lower
courts.
and
in
appropriate
cases
where
there
are
fact
issues
for
instructions
to
a
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
seventh
circuit
had
been
reversed
in
mills;
judge
swygert
was
a
member
of
that
panel.
the
reason
for
reversal
was
that
panel’s
holding
that
liability
was
not
established
without
a
factual
determination
of
the
probability
that
a
truthful
proxy
statement
would
have
produced
a
different
result.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes
i
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
this
ground,
there
is
a
difference
between
this
courts
scouring
the
record
to
determine
whether
the
facts
omitted
from
the
proxy
statement
and
found
to
be
established
without
genuine
controversy
in
the
lower
courts,
whether
those
facts
were
properly
found
and
existed
without
genuine
controversy.
this
court
declined
to
consider
that
question
but
this
court
did
directly
address
the
question
of
what
is
the
test?
what
is
the
standard?
that
was
an
essential
step
in
the
court’s
concluding
that
the
seventh
circuit
erred
in
denying
summary
judgment
and
in
this
court’s
remanding
the
case
with
the
direction
that
summary
judgment
must
be
entered.
the
court
was
laying
down
if
you
will,
a
formula
saying
these
are
the
elements
that
must
be
established
to
impose
liability
in
a
proxy
case.
one
of
those
elements
is
the
omission
of
facts
which
are
material
in
the
sense
that
they
might
have
been
considered
important
to
a
reasonable
shareholder.
this
propensity,
excuse
me—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
this
court
made
that
determination.
i
was
quoting
the
language
of
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion
for—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
oh
in
that
case—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes,
yes.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
that
is
right.
a
standard
which
requires
and
i
can
take
it
directly
from
the
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes,
they
were
careful
to
put
aside
any
possibility
of
a
requirement
of
a
showing
an
independent
proof
of
reliance
or
causation
or
probability.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
think,
perhaps
although
judge
finley
in
the
gerstle
case
had
granted
summary
judgment
even
though
he
chose
to
state
it
somewhat
differently.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
think
yes..
i
think
that
is
clear.
what
they
were
principally
rejecting
your
honor
was
the
argument
which
was
presented,
advanced
in
terms
of
significant
propensity.
that
those
were
that
phrase
was
used
as
the
catch
phrase
and
the
building
block
for
an
argument,
you
had
to
look
to
whether
the
case
would
--
vote
would
have
come
out
the
other
way.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
any
of
the
tests,
the
standards,
the
phrasings
of
materiality
which
have
been
offered
except
one
which
plainly
invites
this
court
simply
to
overrule
mills
on
page
14
of
petitioner’s
reply
brief.
they
asked
this
court
to
announce
a
standard
that
imposes
a
heavy
burden,
this
is
at
the
top
of
page
14
to
show
that
the
fact
omitted,
because
of
its
obvious
significance
almost
certainly
would
have
turned
the
shareholder’s
vote
the
other
way.
that
is
almost
precisely
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
mills.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes
we
do
your
honor.
it
is
a
significant
propensity
to
affect
the
judgment
of
the
reasonable
shareholder.
we
think
that
it
is
for
all
practical
purposes
and
decision
of
concrete
cases
the
equivalent
of
this
court’s
formulation
in
mills.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
do
not.
i
do
not
rather
the—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
must
confess
mr.
justice
powell
that
i
think
that
that
distinction
between
wood
and
mite
is
in
indeed
gossamer
as
both
courts
considered
that
it
might
be.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes
mr.
justice
powell,
i
might
say
of
course,
we
took
that
position
in
opposition
to
certiorari
from
the
beginning.
we
think
that
the
facts
uncontradicted,
admitted,
established
are
so
obviously
important
under
the
circumstances
that
they
are
beyond
the
reach
of
any
nice
adjustment,
refinement
in—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes
mr.
justice
powell,
with
these
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
with
this
specific
understanding,
which
i
think
was
plainly
understood
by
the
author
of
the
gerstle
opinion
who
chose
to
use
“would”
that
is
that
“would”
does
not
introduce
an
element
of
probability
which
must
be
determined
at
a
trial.
that
was
the
concern
that
judge
swygert
had
with
the
use
of
“would”,
footnote
13
in
judge
swygert’s
opinion
becomes
very
refined
on
that
question
and
that
it
makes
it
plain
that
what
he
is
concerned
about
is
the
possible
connotation
that
“would”
means
or
has
to
be
a
trial
of
the
probability,
mills
directly
rejected
that.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
but
the—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes,
but
i
believe
that
the
basic
question
confronting
this
court
was
not
to
write
an
essay
on
causation
but
to
determine
what
elements
were
necessary
to
make
a
case
of
liability.
and
the
court
expressly
said,
it
is
not
necessary
and
would
be
destructive
of
the
statutory
purpose.
and
the
congressional
purpose
would
substitute
a
judicial
appraisal
of
the
merits
for
the
shareholders
actual
and
informed
vote,
if
that
requirement
were
imposed.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
believe
under
in
cases
where
a
selling
document
is
broadcasted
to
the
public
at
large
in
the
light
of
a
statutory
policy
requiring
full
disclosure
seeking
to
encourage
reliance,
i
think
in
practice
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
if
i
may
answer
this
court
has
not
confronted
the
question
as
yet
which
has
been
decided
in
a
number
of
circuits—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
there
is
some
authority
that
if
they
do
not
need
the
votes,
if
they
have
enough
votes,
half
the
vote,
half
the
shares
so
they
can
put
it
through
without
a
proxy
statement.
there
is
some
authority
that
in
that
situation,
the
proxy
statement
will
not
have
any
cause
or
relationship
with
the
merger
that
has
been
expressed
and
rejected
in
the
second
circuit
in
the
(inaudible).
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
am
sorry.
perhaps,
i
did
not
make
the
factual
premise..
it
is
the
situation
where
the
defendant
has
their
shares.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes.
that
in
no
situations
where
the
defendant
already
has
the
votes
and
does
not
need
any
proxy
votes
then
causation
will
bar
any
civil
action.
there
is
authority
to
that
effect,
yes.
it
is
minority.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
should
have
made
plainer
mr.
justice
white,
i
apologize.
there
is
a
whole
line
of
cases
which
says
that
if
the
proxy
statement
did
not
authorize
the
action
which
caused
the
injury
of
which
the
plaintiff
complains,
there
is
no
cause
or
relationship.
if
the
proxy
statement
merely
failed
to
reveal
some
prior
wrong
doing,
which
is
not
the
subject
of
the
proxy
vote,
there
is
no
cause
or
relationship.
the
four
admitted
facts
were
not
speaking
to
the
question
of
the
basis
of
the
district
court’s
decision.
and
whether
the
district
court
denied
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
it
found
that
there
were
factual
issues.
the
grounds
on
which
the
district
court
chose
not
to
grant
summary
judgment,
i
think
a
careful
reading
will
disclose
do
not
rest
on
a
general
proposition
that
there
are
genuine
issues
of
material
fact.
first,
there
is
the
substantial
premium
over
current
market
values
represented
by
the
securities
being
offered
to
the
tsc
shareholders.
he
found
that
that
violation
did
not
warrant
summary
judgment
because
he
said
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
corrected
value
of
the
warrants
and
mr.
noyes
opinion
fully
explained,
said
those
warrants
were
not
worth
the
$5.00
and
a
quarter
market
value
that
was
listed
in
the
proxy
statement.
it
was
his
opinion
that
with
the
issuance
of
six
times
as
many
warrants,
$3
million
and
instead
of
less
than
half
a
million,
there
would
be
a
substantial
decline
to
$3.50.
that
decline
abolished
any
substantial
premium
and
we
asserted
that
half
the
opinion
had
been
presented.
the
good
news
had
been
presented,
the
bad
news
had
been
held
back.
judge
mclaren
rejected
that
ground
because
he
said
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
revised
warrant
value
would
substantially
destroy
the
premium.
we,
i
think
we
are
at
fault
in
not
making
it
clear
that
all
that
was
required
was
simple
arithmetic
as
applied
to
the
exchange
ratio
plugging
in
the
market
values.
when
it
came
to
the
madison
national
purchases
of
$260,000.00
shares
of
national
common
stock
during
the
two
year
period
for
which
the
market
values
are
nicely
set
forth
conveniently
in
the
proxy
statement,
when
edward
merkle
was
on
the
payroll
of
national
receiving
$12,000.00
a
year
for
one
day
a
month,
$1,000.00
a
day
for
such
services
as
the
tsc
board
might
call
upon
him
to
perform.
the
reason
for
denial
of
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
on
that
ground
was
as
matter
of
law.
he
said
there
is
no
necessity
for
disclosure
here
unless
there
was
collusion,
unless
national
and
mr.
merkle
for
madison
got
together
and
agreed
that
they
should
do
this.
we
took
the
position
which
we
again
perhaps,
failed
to
make
clear
that
whether
mr.
merkle
was
acting
in
consultation
with
national
officers
or
purely
unilateral,
his
actions
were
called
in
to
question
by
his
relationships
with
national
as
an
employee
and
there
was
a
duty
to
disclose
regardless
of
whether
a
substantive
violation
of
some
other
provision,
some
provision
forbidding
market
rigging
was
involved
or
not.
we
were
not
saying
that
the
purchasers
were
unlawful
in
themselves.
we
were
simply
saying
that
they
should
be
disclosed
and
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
the
preferred
shares
were—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
would
have
to
add
it
up;
the
shares
were
selling
in
at
about
12
so
i
guess
that
would
be
about
$2500.00.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
if
the
market
with
the
elimination
of
the
premium
would
have
been
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
the
value
of
the
warrant
was
five
and
a
quarter
as
less
than
the
proxy
statement,
mr.
noyes
said
that
value
will
not
hold
that
market
price
is
not
a
fair
indicator
of
the
value
of
that
warrants.
he
will
in
fact
receive
that
will
drop
to
350.
mr.
noyes
was
right.
it
did
drop
to
350.
within—
mr.
harry
b.
reese
yes
your
honor?
mr.
harry
b.
reese
the
warrants
are
worth
about
$2.00,
they
are
up
with
the
recent
market
search.
the
b
preferred
is
worth
about
$14.00.
the
national
common
into
which
the
b
preferred
is
convertible
at
a
discount
three
quarters
of
a
share
of
common
is
most
recently,
i
believe,
quoted
at
$11.00.
i
should
explain
your
honor
that
those
are
all
outside
the
record.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
the
theoretical
loss,
the
client
in
a
sense,
i
do
not
mean
to
evade
the
question,
the
suit
is
derivative.
the
particular
loss
to
northway
would,
i
am
sorry
your
honor
i
cannot
answer
it
directly
because
we
had
not
tried
the
damage
question.
but
the
--
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
would
think
substantially
more
your
honor.
our
expert
has
analyzed
the
value
of
tsc
and
its
shares
and
the
value
of
the
national
securities
that
were
received,
he
has
concluded
that
the
tsc
securities
were
undervalued
and
depressed
after
national
obtained
control
and
that
their
true
value
was
not
$12.00
or
$13.00
but
perhaps,
somewhere
in
the
20s,
so
we
would
be
talking
about
a
matter
of
$10.00
or
more
per
share.
mr.
harry
b.
reese
i
think
that
is
probably
a
grand
description
for
a
family,
personal
corporation
of
a
retired
businessman
established
simply
as
a
part
of
his
state
planning
and
to
handle
his
personal
investments.
the
grounds
of
judge
mclaren’s
opinion,
if
i
may
resume
and
try
to
put
that
one
to
rest,
he
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
no
duty
to
disclose
unless
there
was
in
fact
manipulation
and
that
is
not
a
determination
and
adjudication
as
to
a
question
of
fact
but
as
to
what
the
law
requires.
my
time
has
expired.
