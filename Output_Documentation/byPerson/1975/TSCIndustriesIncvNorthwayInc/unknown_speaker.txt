mr.
morency,
you
refer
to
a
couple
as
to
the
summary
judgment
record.
is
it
all
you
have
to
maintain
i
suppose,
is
that
your
opponents
were
not
entitled
to
have
summary
judgment
granted?
do
you
go
further
and
contend
that
on
the
summary
judgment
record
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
summary
judgment
or
that
it
was
a
fact
question
that
should
have
been
resolved
by
trial
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
accept
the
test
that
the
commission
proposed,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
did
not
but
it
does
here.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
what
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
suggests
in
their
amicus
brief
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
let
us
see
what
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
says
here.
to
the
contrary
it
believes,
and
i
guess
the
commission
believed,
that
mills
announced
the
following
criterion
for
determining
when
facts
submitted
from
the
proxy
statement
or
material,
whether
the
omitted
facts
have
a
significant
propensity
to
affect
the
judgment
of
a
reasonable
shareholder
in
deciding
how
to
vote.
now,
do
you
accept
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reese,
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question
i
was
going
to
put
but
i
will
put
it
more
specifically.
do
you
perceive
any
distinction
at
all
between
the
standard
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
proposed
by
the
sec?
unknown
speaker
that
materiality
and
causation
kind
of
come
together
and
end
up
to
be
very
much
the
same
question?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
to
be
in
cases
like
mills
and
associated
(inaudible),
so
long
as
one
does
not
have
to
show
actual
reliance
of
any
kind,
then
materiality
and
causation
are
very
much
the
same
thing
right?
unknown
speaker
it
might
have
been.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
were
one
who
voted
for
it
and
your
votes
were
critical
in
passing?
unknown
speaker
in
general,
are
there
some
district
courts
or
some
courts
of
appeals
that
say
that
causation
is
a
relevant
issue
in
trials
of
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
plaintiff
sues
and
the
defendant
says
well,
look
now,
that
plaintiff
just
was
never
hurt
by
this.
it
is
not
an
individual
question.
it
is
a
question
of
causation
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
respondent
owned
200
shares
if
i
recall,
what
is
the
market
value
of
those
shares
at
the
time
of
the
merger?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
shares
that
your
client
own.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
market
value
of
the
securities
obtaining
value
of
client,
say
a
month
or
a
year
later?
unknown
speaker
leave
that
elimination
of
premium.
i
am
talking
now
about
the
securities
your
client
received
in
the
merger.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
--
unknown
speaker
what
are
their
worth
today
on
the
market?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
take
the
current
market
of
these
securities
today
as
compared
to
the
market
pre-merger
of
the
whole
stock,
what
is
the
theoretical
loss
to
your
client
if
you
sold
that
today?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
holding
corporation?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
thank
you(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
none,
none
your
honor.
