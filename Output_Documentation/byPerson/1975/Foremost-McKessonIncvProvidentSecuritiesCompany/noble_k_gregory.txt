mr.
noble
k.
gregory
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
with
emphasizing
a
factual
point,
although
it
is
not
crucial
to
the
main
argument,
but
it
came
up
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
in
this
case,
at
least
from
the
so-called
kern
county
argument.
provident
was
never
a
fiduciary
of
this
corporation,
foremost-mckesson.
it
was
only
a
creditor.
all
it
had
acquired
were
convertible
debentures
which
are
covered
by
section
16
(b)
because
of
their
convertible
nature,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
that
a
person
coming
under
16
(b)
as
a
beneficial
owner
technically
is
not
always
a
fiduciary,
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
it.
the
relationship
is
very
clearly
pointed
out
in
many
of
the
cases
of
a
convertible
debenture
owner
is
that
of
a
creditor
and
all
they
had
was
the
information
after
they
became
a
credit
that
a
creditor
normally
would
have.
now,
they
had
knowledge
of
their
own
assets
of
course,
but
that
was
not
knowledge
that
they
received
as
a
result
of
the
relationship,
which
brings
me
to
what
i
think
is
the
key
provision
in
section
16
(b).
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
unfair
use
of
information
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
a
beneficial
owner
that
is
more
than
a
10%
stockholder,
director
or
officer
by
reason
of
his
relationship
to
the
issuer.
i
think
that
is
the
key
to
interpreting
the
so-called
proviso
or
exemption
that
the
section
16
(b)
shall
not
be
construed
to
cover
any
transaction
were
such
beneficial
owner,
that
is
the
more
than
10%
stockholder,
was
not
such
both
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
the
sale.
now,
foremost
attempts
to
make
a
great
deal
of
statement
in
the
reliance
electric
case
that
there
is
no
legislative
history
of
the
proviso,
and
that
is
correct.
there
is
very
legislative
history
of
the
proviso,
but
it
even
goes
so
far
as
to
take
that
out
of
context
because
what
the
opinion
says
that
although
there
may
be,
i
am
not
putting,
i
am
paraphrasing,
no
legislative
history
of
the
proviso,
nonetheless
that
does
not
justify
the
parting
from
the
clear
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
will
read
what
the
court
said
so
i
would
not
unfairly
paraphrase
it.
“the
proviso
cannot
be
disregarded
simply
on
the
ground
that
it
may
be
inconsistent
with
our
assessment,
the
court’s
assessment
of
the
wholesome
purposes
of
the
act.”
now,
more
important
that,
as
i
suggest,
it
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
nobody
could
deny
it,
and
this
purpose
clause,
i
think,
exemplifies
that
legislative
history
and
it
is
helpful
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
the
case
at
bar.
both
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
gone
into
it
at
length
and
i
would
not
go
into
the
detail,
but
i
think
i
can
clearly
state
with
confidence
that
it
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
use
of
the
inside
information
by
one
who
is
a
substantial
stockholder
before,
and
i
emphasize
there
the
before,
he
had
made
a
purchase
or
an
acquisition
or
before
with
the
intent
to
sell
at
a
quick
profit.
now,
i
realize
that
it
took
the
intent
language
out
of
the
statute
and
put
in
a
rule
of
thumb,
but
the
point
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
is
still
in
its
purpose
clause
which
was
added
when
it
took
out
the
rule
and
put
in
the
rule
of
thumb,
or
before
he
sold
at
a
high
price
with
the
expectation
of
making
a
quick
repurchase
at
a
lower
price,
both
of
these,
as
the
seventh
circuit
points
out,
are
one
ends
of
a
swing
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
a
short-swing
transaction.
it
shows,
in
other
words,
that
the
aim
of
section
16
(b)
was
to
discourage
large
stockholders,
and
i
am
only
talking
for
the
moment
about
stockholders,
from
making
quick
profits
by
entering
into
the
short-swing
transaction
because
of
inside
information
received
by
reasons
of
their
relationship
to
the
corporation.
that
is
the
proviso
which
was
interpreted
in
kern
county
land,
and
i
will
not
paraphrase
that
and
i
will
try
not
to.
in
kern
county
land,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
aim
of
that
statute
is
the
misuse
of
information
obtained
after
the
acquisition
of
substantial
stockholdings,
not
purchases
“based
on
inside
information
obtained
from
stockholdings
that
did
not
yet
exist.”
now,
that
is
the
situation
here.
certainly,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
provident
had
knowledge
of
its
own
assets,
but
it
did
not
have
that
knowledge
as
a
result
of
any
relationship
to
foremost.
now,
mr.
moskin
in
his
brief
before
the
court
of
chambers
on
the
tail
of
hearts,
i
should
say,
and
any
statute
does
not
apply
to
everything.
there
are
always
situations
where
it
is
not
going
to
apply.
that
was
recognized
clearly
in
reliance.
it
is
recognized
by
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court.
obviously,
the
statute
never
applies
if
a
stockholder
never
gets
more
than
9%.
he
can
speculate
all
he
wants
as
far
as
16
(b)
is
concerned,
as
long
as
he
never
gets
more
than
9%
or
he
can
wait
for
the
six
months.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
he
can
do
and
some
of
the
things
he
can
do
under
the
statute
and
under
the
purpose
is,
acquire
information,
not
as
a
result
of
his
relationship
to
the
corporation,
but
for
a
(inaudible).
there
were
provisions
in
the,
and
i
think
that
again
goes
back
to
the
legislative
history,
their
original
provisions
or
early
provisions
would
have
prohibited
that
because
he
might
have
a
relationship
not
to
the
corporation
by
stockholding,
but
by
some
other
relations,
and
get
the
inside
information
and
make
a
killing
and,
of
course,
there
are
remedies
for
that.
congress
did
not
stop
the
16
(b),
but
16
(b)
cannot
be
made
into
a
device
to
solve
all
problems
of
inside
information
or
the
misuse
them.
it
is
only
designed
by
its
very
terms
and
its
purpose
to
prevent
the
unfair
use
of
the
inside
information
arising
by
reason
of
the
relationship
with
the
corporation
to
the
person
making
the
short-swing
transaction.
i
think
i
would
like
to
go
on
now
to
the
other
ground,
but
i
would
like
first
to
make
one
point
which
i
think
should
be
made.
mr.
moskin
keeps
making
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
i
did
not
argue
this
point
strenuously
in
the
ninth
circuit.
he
says
we
did
not
make
it.
we
made
it,
but
we
did
not
urge
it
orally.
the
reason,
i
think,
is
obvious.
we
had
a
conflict
with
the
second
circuit
if
we
went
on
that
ground,
and
although,
i
am
highly
honored
to
be
arguing
the
case
here,
my
client
is
less
than
happy
of
the
expense..
i,
naturally,
tried
to
win
on
the
ground
which
i
thought
would
end
the
case.
but
the
potential
for
speculative
abuse
point
is
the
main
argument
that
i
have
made
in
the
ninth
circuit
and,
that
based
on
the
kern
county
land
case
i
think
fits
this
case
very
well.
it
does
not
fit
to
a
t,
it
is
not
a
white
horse
case.
there
never
are
any,
but
there
are
two
facts
that
both
the
ninth
circuit
in
rejecting
it
and
mr.
moskin
tends
to
brush
over.
the
most
important
one
is
the
one
i
started
with,
this
lack
of
any
fiduciary
relationship.
this
was
not
stock.
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
treats
provident
as
a
stockholder.
now,
as
i
say,
i
do
not
deny
that
16
(b)
applies
because
of
the
convertible
nature,
but
that
is
the
only
reason
it
applies
not
because
provident
went
out
to
buy
stock.
provident
went
out
to
sell
assets
as
a
part
of
the
liquidation.
the
corporation
was
going
into
liquidation.
the
sole
purpose
of
this
transaction,
as
far
as
provident
was
concerned
and
this
is
an
objective
fact,
was
to
liquidate
this
corporation
to
avoid
tax
consequences
and
this
was
a
legitimate
method
of
complying
with
the
tax
laws.
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
heirs
of
the
crocker
estate,
your
honor.
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
i
do
not
recall
the
name.
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
bother
to
check
who
the
particular
stockholders
were,
but
they
were
all
heirs
and
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you.
it
may
be
in
the
record,
i
am
just
not
sure,
but
they
were
heirs
of
the
crocker
estate
and
formed
a
family
corporation
to
hold
certain
assets
of
the
crocker
family
and
they
found
tax
problems
and
they
wanted
to
liquidate.
now,
their
desire
to
liquidate
was
to
sell
the
assets
and
they
hired
dillon
reed
to
find
somebody
that
would
buy
the
assets
and
the
only
people
that
were
satisfactory
were
foremost
and
they
thought
they
had
an
arrangement
with
foremost
whereby
they
could
avoid
any
problems.
other
problems
arose,
if
they
had
carried
it
out
as
they
originally
designed,
unfortunately
they
did
not,
they
would
have
no
16
(b)
problem.
i
would
like
to
mention
too
that
although
there
is
an
agenda
in
which
at
the
bottom
is
a
mention
of
16
(b),
the
impression
i
am
sure
mr.
moskin
did
not
intend
to
give,
that
this
was
all
designed
to
get
around
16
(b)
is
not
borne
out
by
the
record.
all
it
was
is
that
apparently,
somebody
mentioned
there
might
be
a
16
(b)
problem.
the
case
came
up
on
summary
judgment
so
we
do
not
have
a
full
detail
of
that.
now,
the
other
point
is,
again,
the
convertible
debentures.
that
was
the
condition
to
the
whole
agreement
to
sell
the
assets
to
foremost,
and
i
am
not
trying
to
be
a
picayune
in
calling
it
a
sale
of
assets.
i
realize
that,
under
one
possible
normal
construction
of
any
sale
of
assets
for
a
stock
it
is
a
technical
purchase,
but
that
is
the
whole
point
i
believe
occurred
that
where
you
have
something
that
technically
may
be
a
purchase
if
it
is
not
within
the
potential
for
speculative
abuse,
then
you
look
at
the
realistic
transaction.
now,
the
day
after
the
agreement
to
sell,
the
corporation
went
into
liquidation
and
a
corporation
in
liquidation
does
not
normally
engage
in
speculation
and,
under
california
law,
it
is
not
permitted
to
engage
in
speculation.
the
liquidation
of
the
corporation
was
never
a
stockholder
of
foremost.
and,
as
a
debenture
holder,
provident
was
only
a
creditor,
as
i
said.
there
was,
as
the
district
court
pointed
out
and
i
should
say
this
is
the
ground
on
which
the
district
court
decided
the
case,
that
it
was
not
a
potential
for
speculative
abuse,
foremost
made
no
claim
in
the
trial
court,
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
that
provident
derived
inside
information
profit
or
advantage
“from
its
all
but
monetary
status
as
an
insider
of
foremost.”
foremost
claims
that
provident
had
inside
information,
i
think
i
covered
that,
it
was
inside
information
that
had
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
was
selling
it.
now,
even
if
the
information
as
its
own
assets
could
have
given
provident
an
opportunity,
it
was
not
an
opportunity
that
arose
out
of
the
stockholdings.
justice
powell,
i
think,
asked
about
the
other
ground
that
was
considered
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
point
there,
again,
we
must
look
at
this
case
in
view
of
the
facts
and
the
purposes
and
i
think,
as
kern
county
applies,
the
agreement
was
very
clear
that
the
time
and
date
of
sale
was
after
the,
i
believe
it
was
october
28
was
to
be
the
date
of
sale,
i
think
this
date
is
wrong,
and
before
that,
more
than
half
of
these
debentures
were
distributed
to
the
stockholders
of
provident.
now,
there
are
cases
of
both
ways.
there
are
cases
that
mr.
moskin
relies
on
that
you
disregard
all,
but
the
contract
controls,
but
i
submit
if
we
follow
the
teaching
of
kern
county
that
you
look
at
the
transaction
realistically
where
there
is
no
potential
for
speculative
abuse
and
you
also
look
at
it
technically
from
the
contract
law
point
of
view,
there
was
no
sale
until
all
of
these
conditions
had
passed.
now,
there
are
two
other
arguments.
neither
one
of
which,
i
think
mr.
moskin
misspoke
himself,
he
said
the
ninth
circuit
passed
on
and
neither
the
trial
court
nor
the
ninth
circuit
passed
on
the
other
two
arguments.
i
think
they
are
perhaps
not
ones
that
this
court
does
not
want
to
pass
on,
but
i
do
want
to
mention
that
there
are
questions
of
whether
this
comes
within
the
exception
for
a
liquidating
agent
under
california
law
when
this
liquidation
plan
was
adapted.
the
directors
became
liquidating
agents.
they
held
the
stock
only
for
the
beneficiaries.
in
addition,
under
california
law
once
they
passed
a
dividend
which
they
did
in
distributing
dividend
the
debentures
in
foremost
evolved
upon
the
beneficiaries
and
there
was
no
beneficial
interest.
those
are
matters
primarily
of
california
law.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
and
i
hope
they
never
have
to.
i
think
that
the
other
arguments
are
sufficient
and
i
suggest
that
this
court
should
follow
the
clear
learning
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
clear
purpose
of
this
statute
and
if
so,
they
will
find
that
this
does
not
come
within
section
16
(b).
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
the
conditions
were
inexistent
until
the
actual
transfer
of
the
debentures
under
the
underwriting,
your
honor
because
there
was
that
condition.
it
has
provided
the
expressed
date.
this
would
be
the
date
of
sale
and
until
that
time,
the
underwriting
could
be
set
aside
for
various
conditions
and
prior
to
that
time,
over
half
the
stock
or
over
half
the
debentures
were
distributed
to
the
individuals.
as
you
may
recall,
originally,
all
of
the
debentures
--
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
i
believe
24
was
when
--
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
that
is
correct.
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
that
is
correct,
and
then
the
sale
actually
took
place
on,
i
believe
it
was,
the
31st.
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
yes,
sir?
mr.
noble
k.
gregory
i
would
say
involuntary
in
one
term.
that
was
an
involuntary
conversion.
there
was
a
voluntary
aspect
to
that
case.
there
was
an
option
agreement
which
was
completely
voluntary
in
the
same
sense
that
this
was
voluntary.
they
did
not
even
have
to
enter
into
it.
once
they
entered
into
it,
of
course,
they
were
bound
by
it,
but
the
only
involuntary
thing
that
occidental
could
not
do
anything
about
this
was
the
conversion,
but
this
court
had
two
sales
in
the
kern
county
case.
one
was
the
conversion
and
the
other
was
the
option
agreement
which
was
entered
into
willingly,
but
under
the
duress
of
the
commercial
transaction.
but,
i
could
hardly
call
that
involuntary
any
more
than
mr.
moskin
seems
to
think
that
we
are
claiming
that
provident
involuntarily
sold
its
assets.
it
did
not
involuntarily
sell
its
assets
and
in
the
sense
that
it
could
have
not
taken
this
offer
and
not
liquidate
it,
it
was
voluntary,
but
the
form
of
the
transaction
was
not
the
one
it
chose.
it
was
the
one
that
it
had
to
accept
under
the
exigencies
of
the
moment,
your
honor,
which
i
think
are
equally
applicable
to
the
kern
case
and
this
case.
mr.
noble
