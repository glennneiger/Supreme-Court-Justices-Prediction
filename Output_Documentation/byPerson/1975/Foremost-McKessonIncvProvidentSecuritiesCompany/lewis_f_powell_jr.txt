justice

f.

mr.
moskin,
i
suppose
you
are
coming
to
this,
but
why
do
you
think
the
statute
through
the
proviso
draws
a
distinction
between
a
10%
holder
and
an
officer
and
a
director?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
statute
does
make
a
distinction
between
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
the
security
holder
on
the
hand,
the
officer
and
director
on
the
other?
it
does
only
in
respect
to
the
proviso.
i
think,
for
example,
earlier
where
the
statute
talks
about
the
purpose,
it
is
kind
of
a
preamble
in
16
(b)
which
says
“for
the
purpose
of
preventing
any
unfair
use
of
information
which
may
have
been
obtained
by
such
beneficial
owner,
director,
or
officer
by
reason
of
his
relationship
to
the
issuer,
etcetera.”
now,
there
is
no
distinction
made
there
and
there
is
no
distinction
made
in
respect
of
reporting.
the
reporting
requirements
in
16
(a)
apply
without
difference
to
an
officer,
director,
and
10%
stockholder.
that
reporting
is
required
the
moment
one
becomes
a
10%
stockholder
or
rather
within
10
days
thereafter.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
but
the
basic
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
reach
people
who
have
inside
information.
now,
tell
me
as
a
practical
matter
how
a
10%
stockholder
who
does
not
have
a
representative
on
the
board
obtains
inside
information
lawfully?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
moskin,
if
you
were
counsel
to
a
corporation
that
had
a
10%
stockholder
not
represented
on
the
board,
would
you
advise
the
corporation
to
make
any
information
available
to
that
10%
stockholder
that
was
not
available
to
all
stockholders?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
in
light
of
10
(b)
(5)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
a
different
question
entirely
though,
is
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
that
is
the
question
before
us
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
see.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
moskin,
i
know
your
time
is
running
short,
but
i
am
interested
in
the
date
of
sale
question
in
this
case.
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on
that
before
you
conclude.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
really
not
suggesting
that
the
market
out,
as
you
call
it,
is
meaningless,
are
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
testified
as
to
your
experience
and
now
i
will
testify
as
to
mine.
i
have
seen
them
exercised.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
your
answer
is
that
although
they
are
valid
conditions
to
the
obligation
of
the
underwriters
to
buy
and
although
the
underwriting
agreement
states
that
the
date
of
purchase
shall
be
the
28th,
that
because
these
conditions
are
extremely
unlikely
to
happen,
nevertheless,
the
sale
occurred
on
october
21?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gregory.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
rely
on
kern
county.
my
recollection
is
that
the
issue
there
was
involved
with
sale
and
that
was
an
involuntary
sale
resulting
from
a
merger?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
was
a
result
of
a
negotiation
between
the
parties,
was
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
not
the
merger
in
kern
county?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
alright.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
section
16
b
of
the
security
exchange
act
of
1934
allows
a
corporation
to
recover
profit,
realized
by
an
officer,
director,
beneficial
owner
of
more
than
10%
of
its
shares,
where
that
has
been
a
purchase
and
the
sale
of
its
shares
within
a
six
months
period.
we
took
this
case
to
determine
the
meaning
of
an
exemptive
provision,
which
specifies
that
the
statute
does
not
cover
any
transaction
where
the
beneficial
owner
was
not
such
both
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
the
sale
of
the
shares
involved.
as
the
facts
of
this
case
are
too
complex
for
oral
summary,
i
will
announce
only
our
decision.
we
conclude
in
view
of
the
language
of
the
exemptive
provision,
that
a
beneficial
owner
is
accountable
for
profits
in
a
purchase
sale
sequence,
only
if
he
was
such
an
owner,
before
the
purchase
as
well
as,
at
the
time
of
the
sale.
as
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
not
a
beneficial
owner
before
the
purchase.
the
subsequent
sale
within
six
months,
is
not
subject
to
section
16b.
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
same
view.
accordingly
we
affirm
this
judgment.
mr.
justice
white
joins
in
all
but
part
4
c
of
a
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
