mr.
morton
moskin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
arises
under
section
16
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
a
holder
of
more
than
10%
that
is
to
say,
a
beneficial
owner
of
more
than
10%
of
the
equity
securities
of
petitioner,
within
six
months
of
that
purchase
which
made
respondent
such
an
equity
owner,
sold
certain
of
those
equity
securities
and
realized
a
profit
thereby.
nevertheless,
it
found
that
there
was
no
liability
under
the
statute
because
it
concluded
that
the
transaction
by
which
respondent
became
a
10%
beneficiary
was
not
one
that
met
the
requirements
of
a
section
16
(b)
purchase.
to
come
to
that
conclusion,
it
relied
upon
a
proviso
in
section
16
(b)
which
provides
that
the
subsection
shall
not
be
construed
to
cover
any
transaction
where
such
beneficial
owner
was
not
such,
both
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
and
sale
or
the
sale
and
purchase
of
the
security
involved.
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
contrary
to
all
of
the
preexisting
authority,
particularly
that
of
the
second
and
eighth
circuits
and
the
stella
case
was
the
case
which
we
contend
is
the
--
was
and
should
remain
the
prevailing
authority
on
the
point.
the
key
facts
all
arose
in
a
two-month
period
in
september
and
october
of
1969.
on
september
25
in
1969,
petitioner
and
respondent
entered
into
an
agreement.
i
should
pause
to
note
that
the
statute
provides
that
a
purchase
is
defined
to
include
an
agreement
to
purchase
and
a
sale
is
defined
to
include
an
agreement
to
sell.
the
agreement
was
one
by
which
respondent
would
exchange
some
$54
million
of
its
assets,
roughly
two-thirds
of
this
personal
holding
company’s
assets,
in
exchange
for
$4.25
million
in
cash
and
just
under
$50
million
of
debentures
which
were
immediately
convertible
into
common
stock
of
foremost-mckesson.
on
the
13th
of
october,
two
days
before
the
closing
under
that
agreement,
the
shareholders
of
provident
met
informally
to
consider
what
their
agenda
described
as
the
section
16
(b)
problem.
they
went
on
two
days
later
to
close
this
transaction
and
acquired
at
that
point
in
time
$40
million
of
immediately
convertible
debentures.
five
days
later,
another
$7.5
million
of
these
convertible
debentures
were
delivered
pursuant
to
adjustments
in
the
closing
price
under
the
agreement.
the
next
day,
on
october
21,
respondent
entered
into
agreement
along
with
petitioner
and
dillon,
read
&
company
on
behalf
of
an
underwriting
group
to
sell
$25
million
of
these
convertible
debentures
and
the
closing
under
that
underwriting
agreement
took
place
on
october
28.
the
respondent
would
undoubtedly
stress
two
additional
facts
and
i
would
like
to
put
those
before
the
bench
at
this
time
as
well.
they
argued
that
on
october
13,
the
day
when
the
shareholders
informally
met
to
consider
the
“section
16
(b)
problem,”
the
board
of
provident
also
adapted
a
so-called
liquidating
dividend,
one
which
did
not
fix
any
specified
date
for
the
liquidating
dividend
and
which
was
subject
to
various
contingencies
and
other
legal
requirements,
including
the
fact
that,
under
california
law,
debtors
and
others
with
claims
against
the
company
would
have
to
be
satisfied
before
any
liquidation
could
take
place.
the
second
point
which
perhaps
they
will
stress
or
emphasize
or
report
to
you
is
that
on
october
24,
between
the
date
underwriting
agreement
was
signed
and
the
date
it
was
closed,
there
was
distribution
of
2,225,0000
face
amount
of
these
debentures
to
shareholders
of
provident,
and
we
concede
--
mr.
morton
moskin
yes,
your
honor
and
we
concede
that
had
that
liquidating
distribution
taken
place
before
the
21st
there
would
not
be
section
16
(b)
liability.
we
concede
that
on
the
authority
of
the
reliance
electric
case.
now
then,
this
case
began
when
respondent
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
federal
district
court
because
it
wished
to
liquidate
and
dissolve.
that
court
on
what
it
considered
equitable
considerations
found
for
respondent.
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
affirmed,
but
in
the
process
rejected
all
of
the
arguments
that
had
been
made
by
the
respondent
and
they
said,
among
other
things,
that
there
was
sufficient
cooperation
between
the
parties
prior
to
the
purchase
such
as,
it
could
give
rise
to
the
possibility
of
obtaining
inside
information
at
that
point
in
time.
they
also
said
that
between
the
purchase
date
and
the
sale
date
that
there
was
an
opportunity
to
engage
in
speculative
abuse
and
they
went
on
to
add,
that
it
was
the
very
kind
of
speculative
abuse
with
which
the
statute
was
designed
to
cope.
i
would
like
to
just
stress
a
few
brief
factual
items
in
the
appendix
on
the
first
of
those
two
points,
the
pre-purchase
cooperation
because
provident’s
brief
at
page
38
states
that
it
is
undisputed
that
negotiations
only
involve
in
evaluation
of
provident's
assets.
not
only
is
there
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that,
but
there
is,
indeed
items
or
there
are
not
any
items
in
the
record
to
support
the
contrary
inference.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
page
a41
in
the
record
where
mr.
haskel
(ph)
of
dillon,
read,
appearing
before
the
department
of
corporations
of
california
on
the
25th
of
september,
points
out
that
provident
had
hired
dillon,
read
the
previous
september
to
explore
possibilities
and
that
they
went
into
a
great
detail
with
a
number
of
these
companies
and
“examined”
all
of
these
companies.
they
then
settled
upon
foremost
as
the
most
likely
participant
in
a
transaction
to
provide
liquidity
to
its
shareholders
and
on
a46
they
go
on
to
say,
mr.
haskel
does,
that
we
think
the
deal
is
fair
because
quality
of
the
securities
that
we
are
getting,
that
is
to
say
petitioners’
securities,
is
of
sufficient
quality
and
condition
where
we
think
that
they
represent
a
fair
marketable
security
for
the
provident
shareholders.
and
then
on
a74
the
chief
executive
officer
of
provident
observes
in
an
affidavit
that
when
the
foremost
partnership,
if
you
will,
or
deal
had
been
decided
as
the
most
promising,
“there
followed
throughout
the
late
summer
and
early
fall
intense
negotiations
between
foremost
and
provident.”
mr.
morton
moskin
that
last
was
an
affidavit
at
page
a74,
mr.
dillon
warren’s
affidavit.
the
ninth
circuit
relied,
i
think,
on
two
things.
first,
it
purported
to
find
legislative
history
to
support
its
conclusion
in
respect
to
the
proviso.
there
are
a
number
of
answers
to
this
contention.
perhaps
the
most
compelling
is
that
this
court
in
reliance
electric
said
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
explain
the
proviso.
moreover,
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
stella
case
found
any
legislative
history
that
bore
on
the
explanation
of
the
proviso
back
in
1956
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
which
has
submitted
amicus
briefs
to
this
court
in
reliance
and
earlier
to
the
second
circuit
court
in
stella,
found
some
scratch
of
legislative
history
to
the
contrary
to
support
petitioners’
contention
here.
in
addition
to
which,
the
dissent
in
the
stella
case
by
judge
hanks
(ph)
was
one
that
conceded
that
there
was
no
applicable
legislative
history
in
respect
to
the
proviso.
it
is
an
interesting
point
to
note
that
judge
hanks
in
his
dissent
concluded
that
the
principal
reason
for
his
judgment
that
the
proviso
required
that
there
would
be
a
purchase
subsequent
to
becoming
a
10%
stockholder
was
of
that,
in
his
mind,
was
clearly
required
in
respective
directors
and
officers,
a
position
that
mr.
chief
justice
burger
found
in
error
three
years
later
when
he
sat
and
decided
in
the
second
circuit
for
unanimous
court,
in
the
case
of
adler
against
klawans.
moreover,
judge
wallace
himself
in
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think,
was
a
little
inconsistent
on
this
legislative
history
point
because
when
he
came
to
consider
the
meaning
of
“at
the
time
of
purchase”
and
“at
the
time
of
sale,”
he
decided
that
in
respect
to
the
sale,
“sale”
meant
“simultaneously
with”
rather
than
‘prior
to.”
therefore,
he
looked
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute
rather
than
to
the
legislative
history
to
define
the
same
words,
both
at
the
time
of
purchase
and
sale,
differently
in
respect
to
the
purchase
and
in
respect
to
the
sale.
it
is
also
interesting
that
neither
provident
nor
gulf
&
western,
in
the
case
that
was
decided
last
week
in
the
seventh
circuit,
saw
fit
to
urge
the
point
about
this
proviso
and
the
meaning
of
both
at
the
time
of
purchase
and
sale.
it
was
never
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit
by
either
party
and
in
the
gulf
&
western
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
it
was
only
after
the
provident
case
was
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
supplementary
papers
were
submitted
by
the
gulf
&
western
and
consequently,
by
allis-chalmers
to
support
the
then
novel
theory
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and,
incidentally,
the
seventh
circuit
has
found
still
another
view
of
the
meaning
of
these
words
both
at
the
time
of
purchase
and
sale,
a
meaning
which
i
suggest
and
believe
is
at
odds
with
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
the
reliance
electric
case.
staying
for
a
moment
with
the
legislative
history,
i
would
like
to
elude
to
footnote
13
in
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
blue
chip
where
it
is
said
of
another
party,
but
i
think
equally
applicable
in
respect
to
provident
that
they
seek
reinsertion
of
language
into
the
act
that
congress
had
before
it,
but
deleted
prior
to
passage,
that
is
the
very
end
of
footnote
13
in
blue
chip.
so,
we
have
in
respect
of
legislative
history
something
that
gulf
&
western
and
provident
emphasized
different
aspects
of
the
alleged
legislative
history
in
respect
of
and
that
neither
the
ninth
nor
the
seventh
circuit
agreed
on
as
to
what
it
might
be.
the
second
reason
that
the
ninth
circuit
found,
that
there
was
no
liability
in
this
case,
was
based
upon
some
language
in
this
court’s
decision
in
kern
county.
the
language
was
that
they
could
not
have
been
inside
information
obtained
from
substantial
stock
holdings
that
did
not
yet
exist.
the
second
circuit
in
american
standard
against
crane
said,
and
i
trust
and
hope
that
they
are
correct,
that
the
kern
county
decision
was
sui
generis
to
a
defensive
merger
situation.
in
any
event,
there
is
ample
reason
in
the
statute
to
conclude
that
in
a
factual
situation,
such
as
ours
at
least,
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
there
would
be
substantial
stock
holdings
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
or
neither
at
the
time
of
a
purchase
or
a
sale.
you
remember,
earlier,
i
spoke
about
the
statute
defining
contract
to
buy
and
a
contract
to
sell
as
including
purchases
and
sales
and
surely,
a
director
or
an
officer
could
buy
himself
a
contract
without
ever
obtaining
an
equity
position
and
still
liability
would
attach
under
the
statute.
mr.
morton
moskin
the
statute
defines
directors,
officers,
and
10%
beneficial
owners
as
fiduciaries.
it
makes
--
mr.
morton
moskin
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
morton
moskin
i
am
not,
your
honor.
i
am
simply,
in
all
candor,
trying
to
protect
my
flank.
i
think
that
if
you
chose
to
go
that
route,
you
could
still
find
for
petitioner
in
this
case.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
appropriate
way
to
go.
mr.
morton
moskin
i
believe
you
are
absolutely
correct
and
i
agree
with
that
conclusion.
i
think,
hopefully,
it
has
been
established
that
in
this
case
there
was
at
least
an
ambiguity
in
what
the
key
statutory
words
mean.
that
being
so,
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
to
consider
the
results
of
the
alternative
constructions.
and
i
suggest
that
the
one
that
best
carries
out
rather
than
defeats
the
statutory
purposes
is
the
one
that
should
be
adapted.
i
would
like
to
offer
a
few
illustrations.
under
the
ninth
and
seventh
circuit
views,
if
within
six
months
there
was
a
purchase
of
50%
of
the
stock
of
an
issuer
and
all
of
it
was
sold
within
that
time
at
a
profit,
there
will
be
no
liability.
similarly,
if
9.9%
of
the
stock
had
been
acquired
and
then
an
addition
40%
had
been
acquired
and
then
all
of
it
had
been
sold
within
the
same
six-month
period,
again,
there
will
be
no
liability.
and
yet,
if
you
added
one
share
before
the
sale,
there
would
be
liability
for
the
profit
of
that
one
share.
mr.
morton
moskin
that
is
true.
the
statute
is
arbitrary.
it
is
designed
to
deter
and
i
think
the
purposes
of
deterrence,
the
court
--
the
congress,
as
a
matter
of
fact
concluded
that
they
had
to
evaluate
on
the
one
hand
the
beneficial
purposes
of
the
statute
and
also
on
the
other,
the
beneficial
purposes
of
long-term
investments
and
concluded
that
a
six-month
cut
off
would
be
appropriate
to
meet
both
of
those
countervailing
objectives.
in
each
of
these
cases
that
i
have
postulated,
the
director
or
officer
would
be
liable,
at
least
under
the
doctrine
of
adler
against
klawans.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
bought
stock,
60
days
later
became
a
director,
and
then
within
six
months
of
the
purchase
sold
the
shares
and
the
second
circuit
found
liability
should
attach
because
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
that
case
mr.
chief
justice
burger
wrote
that
“at
some
moment
before
making
a
sale
of
stock,
the
insider
was
in
an
official
position
which
he
could
have
used
to
influence
the
sale
price.”
that
brings
me
to
what
i
think
is
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
this
statute,
to
with
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
acquire
this
information
before
or
after
the
initial
transaction
so
long
as
it
exists
prior
to
the
closing
transaction,
the
second
of
the
two
transactions.
and
there
is
again
--
authority
as
legion
to
support
that
view.
not
only
the
adler
against
klawans
case,
but
i
think
that
in
kern
county
this
court
looked
to,
at
least
examined
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
possibility
of
abuse
between
the
date
of
the
purchase
and
the
date
of
the
sale.
i
think,
if
you
consider
the
language
in
adler
and
other
places
to
the
effect
that
the
theory
here
is
the
director,
officer
or
the
beneficial
holder
is
a
fiduciary
and
look
to
common
law
concepts,
it
should
not
matter
whether
the
fiduciary
abuses
this
trust
before
or
after
he
becomes
a
fiduciary
so
long
as
the
abuse
of
trust
has
taken
place
prior
to
the
point
when
the
sale
occurred
and
the
profit
was
realized.
mr.
morton
moskin
i
think
the
statute
draws
that
distinction,
mr.
justice
powell,
because
there
is
some
difference
between
a
holder
of
something
under
10%,
be
it
1
or
8
or
9
and
the
congress
said
10,
and
a
director
or
officer.
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
once
you
get
to
10%,
and
at
one
point
it
was
5%
that
they
were
talking
about,
that
you
have
the
potential
to
control
for
manipulation
that
justifies
your
being
treated
the
same
as
a
director
or
officer.
now,
reliance
electric
made
it
quite
clear
that
this
means
that
in
a
step-up
or
step-down
transaction
that
there
cannot
be
a
liability
attached
if
the
transaction
is
structured
in
an
appropriate
way
so
that
one
--
i
will
put
it
this
way,
if
this
purchase
here
had
been
9.9%
in
one
transaction
and
then
some
additional
amount
in
the
second
transaction,
this
proviso
would
only
catch
the
profit
on
the
second
transaction.
just
as
in
reliance,
this
court
found
that
the
profit
was
only
caught
on
the
step-down
transaction
that
got
you
from,
whatever
it
was,
12.something
to
9.9.
mr.
morton
moskin
absolutely.
mr.
morton
moskin
well,
i
would
answer
that
in
several
ways.
one,
the
statutory
history
suggest
that
one
need
not
be
a
director
or
officer
when
he
owns
as
much
as
10%
of
a
public
company
to
control
the
election
of
directors
and
officers,
to
manipulate
the
behavior
of
the
management
in
a
way
that
would
be
down
to
his
benefit.
in
addition
to
that,
the
ninth
circuit
court
found
the
potential
perspective
of
abuse
in
this
very
case
both
before,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
respect
to
the
intense
negotiations
and
the
cooperation
between
the
parties
and
subsequent
when
it
said
the
assets
in
the
provident
passed
on
to
foremost,
included
a
large
bundle
of
real
estate
and
some
relatively
illiquid
securities.
that
real
estate
was
such
that
it
could
have
required,
and
provident
would
have
known
this
better
than
anybody
else,
substantial
expenditures
of
cash
to
develop
that
property.
so
that,
they
might
have
learned
in
these
negotiations
that
foremost
would
not
pay
a
dividend
next
time
because
it
needed
to
preserve
the
cash
so
that
it
could
proceed
to
develop
these
properties.
what
provident
was
doing
here
was
protecting
itself
against
a
market
risk.
the
--
mr.
morton
moskin
would
you
have
had
to?
no,
you
would
not
have
had
to,
but
the
statute
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
“would
have
had
to.”
it
speaks
in
terms
of
possibilities,
potentials,
and
presumptions.
mr.
morton
moskin
if
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
assets
that
were
transferred
from
provident
to
foremost.
mr.
morton
moskin
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
morton
moskin
not
at
this
point
in
time,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
mr.
morton
moskin
not
in
light,
but
i
would
however,
and
have
any
number
of
times
advised
a
client
in
that
position
that
he
had
better
not
sell
within
six
months
of
that
purchase
because
if
he
did,
it
was
my
opinion
and
remains
my
opinion
that
he
would
be
liable
for
any
profit
he
realized..
mr.
morton
moskin
a
different
question.
mr.
morton
moskin
it
is
indeed.
mr.
morton
moskin
i
am
not
alone
in
contending
that
a
construction
other
than
the
one
for
which
i
contend
would
destroy
the
effectiveness
of
the
statute.
i
think,
i
hope
i
have
given
you
some
examples
to
demonstrate
that.
mr.
morton
moskin
i
think
you
are
alluding
to
the
fact
that
the
negotiations
resulted
in
securities
rather
than
cash
being
transferred
in
exchange
for
the
assets.
to
that
extent,
that
is
true.
the
transaction
was,
nevertheless,
100%
voluntary.
there
was
no
gun
to
the
head
of
the
respondent.
it
was
free
to
enter
into
this
contract
or
not
as
it
saw
fit
and
moreover,
it
was
free
to
wait
six
months
before
it
sold.
and,
as
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
the
bershad
case,
the
responsibility
under
this
statute
rests
with
the
fiduciary
to
structure
the
transaction
in
a
way
to
avoid
the
prohibitions
of
the
statute
because
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
statute
requires
that
one
do
that.
mr.
morton
moskin
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
will
look
at
the
statutory
language,
the
statutory
language
in
respect
of
the
profit
says
the
profit
shall
inure
to
and
be
recoverable
by
the
issuer.
it
has
been
written
and
suggested,
and
you
will
find
a
reference
to
it
in
the
american
standard
case,
that
that
word
“inure”
was
intended
to
create
a
constructive
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
issuer
and
that
ties
right
in
with
my
contention
that
this
is
a
presumed
fiduciary
relationship
to
which
the
statute
addresses
itself.
if
you
look
at
the
alternatives,
perhaps
you
are
suggesting
that
this
may
be
a
windfall
profit
to
the
issuer,
if
that
be
so
the
alternative
is
to
permit
speculation
in
inside
information
within
a
six-month
period
by
statutory
insiders
with
impunity
unless
one
can
meet
the
evidentiary
standards
of
rule
10
(b)
(5).
mr.
morton
moskin
let
me
say
this
that
all
of
the
history
of
the
cases
under
the
statute
says
that
one
presumes
the
misuse
of
inside
information
except
in
the
so-called
unorthodox
transaction.
the
unorthodox
transaction
test
goes
not
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
profit
or
whether
or
not
there
was
an
abuse,
but
the
courts
have
said
“we
will
look
to
the
definition
of
purchase
and
sale
in
an
unorthodox
transaction”
and
conclude
in
two
categories,
i
believe,
of
cases
and
i
have
analyzed
them
that
we
may
not,
under
the
pragmatic
theory,
find
a
purchase
or
a
sale.
those
categories
are,
one,
an
involuntary
transaction
such
as
you
had
in
kern
and,
two,
a
situation
where,
in
effect,
the
economic
equivalent
of
what
you
had
before
is
essentially
that
which
you
had
later
such
as
mr.
justice
stewart’s
decision
in
ferraiolo
against
newman
in
the
sixth
circuit.
moreover,
blau
against
lehman
is
another
case
where,
simply,
there
was
a
transfer
of
corporate
securities
from
one
subsidiary
to
another
subsidiary
and
the
court,
i
think,
properly
concluded
that
there
was
no
change
in
a
general
sense
of
the
term,
and
therefore,
that
was
not
said
to
be
a
purchase.
but,
here,
we
have
a
clear
purchase
and
a
clear
sale
and
i
submit
that
all
of
the
cases
say
that
that
is
where
your
inquiry
ends
in
respect
of
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
potential
for
misuse
of
inside
information.
mr.
morton
moskin
it
is
not
unreasonable,
but
i
am
suggesting
it
is
clearly
within
the
statute
because
it
is
clearly
a
purchase
and
clearly
a
sale.
and
moreover,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
refer
to
some
language
that
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
wrote
again
in
blue
chip
and
simply
substitute
stella
for
the
word
birnbaum
and
16
(b)
for
10
(b).
the
long-standing
acceptance
by
the
courts
coupled
with
congress’
failure
to
reject
stella’s
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
wording
of
16
(b),
then
i
will
line
the
words
that
deal
what
10
(b)
meant,
argue
significantly
in
favor
of
acceptance
of
the
birnbaum,
excuse
me,
stella
rule
by
this
court
citing
blau
against
lehman
which,
in
fact,
was
a
section
16
(b)
case.
there
is
a
long-standing
settled
acceptance
of
the
law
on
this
point.
mr.
morton
moskin
it
was
the
sale.
mr.
morton
moskin
the
second
circuit
has
decided
this
question
at
least
three
times.
perine
against
norton
is
one.
stella
is
another.
newmark
against
rko
is
the
third.
mr.
morton
moskin
do
i
need
more?
mr.
morton
moskin
yes,
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
morton
moskin
well,
we
did
until
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
morton
moskin
yes.
mr.
morton
moskin
i
will
do
that
now,
your
honor.
the
underwriting
agreement
was
an
agreement
to
sell.
on
october
21st
when
that
agreement
was
executed,
all
of
respondents’
rights
and
obligations
were
fixed.
the
profit
was
locked
insofar
as
it
was
concerned.
to
be
sure
there
was
a
condition,
a
market
out
as
it
were
that
it
is
standard
in
underwriting
agreements
from
beginning
of
time
and
which
never
almost
is
used
and
which
would
have
given
the
underwriters
a
right
in
an
extreme
circumstance
in
that
six
or
seven-day
period
not
to
continue
the
transaction,
not
to
close
it.
but,
if
agreement
to
purchase
and
agreement
to
sell
is
to
mean
anything,
and
in
the
context
of
the
statutory
definition
of
purchase
and
sale,
it
would
be
a
very
simple
matter
indeed
for
a
lot
of
meaningless
conditions
to
be
inserted
into
a
contract
and
to
ignore
the
whole
intent
of
the
statute.
mr.
morton
moskin
it
is
meaningless
in
99.4%
of
the
cases
when
underwriting
agreements
are
signed.
mr.
morton
moskin
well,
that
is
the
0.6%
that
i
was
describing,
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
morton
moskin
that
is
my
answer.
mr.
morton
moskin
and
i
must
say,
it
was
also
judge
wallace’s
answer
in
the
ninth
circuit.
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
before
i
conclude
to
refer
also
to
rule
16
(b)
(2)
which
was
adapted
in
1935
in
response
to
an
article
in
the
virginia
law
review
by
mr.
eustace
sullivan
in
which
he
pointed
out
that,
as
he
read
it
then
contemporaneously
with
the
adaption
of
the
statute,
the
construction
for
which
i
contend
was
required
and
it
would
have
prevented
underwriters
from
acquiring
securities
and
distributing
them
in
an
underwriting
unless
the
exemption
would
provide
it,
and
the
sec
obviously
agreed
with
that
construction
of
the
statute
and
under
any
number
of
cases
with
which
this
court
is
familiar,
an
agency
that
is
charged
with
administering
a
statute,
its
views
are
entitled
to
the
special
weight
under
an
ambiguous
situation
such
as
this.
may
i
spend
a
moment
on
the
seventh
circuit
decision?
i
take
it
the
silence
is
yes
and
i
would
proceed
to
do
so.
mr.
morton
moskin
i
will
do
that
if
i
may.
i
said
a
while
back
that
it
rejects
the
teaching
of
reliance
as
well
as
its
analysis
because
it
says
that
a
closing
transaction
in
a
sale
first-purchase
later
is
caught
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
that
second
transaction
the
beneficial
owner
may
own
9.9
or
less
of
the
stock.
i
believe
that
to
be
squarely
in
the
teeth
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
reliance
electric.
thank
you.
