justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
that
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
a
director
or
someone
separately
defined
as
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
say
in
a
factual
situation
such
as
ours,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
ought
to
have
a
number
of
case
by
case
analysis
of
these
things?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
certainly
does
not
seem
what
congress
had
in
mind.
they
wanted
a
flat
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
if
the
sale
were
deferred
so
that
it
took
place
in
seven
months
rather
than
six,
there
would
be
no
liability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
asking
us
to
resolve
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
it
is
unreasonable
for
us
to
ask
ourselves
in
this
situation
what
you
want
covered,
but
which
your
opponent
does
not,
is
there
a
potential
for
abuse,
even
though
if
it
were
clearly
within
the
statute
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
congressional
presumption
would
cover
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
stella
was
the
other
end
of
the
six-month
period,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
the
reasoning
that
judge
kaufman
used
at
any
rate
was
applicable
to
the
other
end
of
the
six-months,
but
you
have
got
an
eighth
circuit
case.
do
you
have
any
more
court
of
appeals
authorities
in
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
have
besides
a
second
and
the
eighth
circuit,
granted
that
the
eight
circuit
as
well
as
the
second
is
a
very
respectable
court?
