justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lynch,
could
i
ask
--
you
say
that
he
has
to
be
told
the
substance
of
the
crime
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
this
lawyer
tells
them
that
if
the
jury
finds
a
-
that
you
are
mentally
competent,
and
b
-
that
you
stabbed
this
lady
44
times,
they
will
find
you
guilty,
would
that
not
be
substantially
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
as
you
admit
that
all
you
have
to
tell
them
is
the
substance
of
the
crime.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
confessed
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
yes.
the
only
thing
that
the
judge
found
was,
he
was
not
aware
of
this
concept
to
intent
which
may
mean
that
he
thought,
well
i
did
really
mean
to
kill
her,
but
that
would
not
be
a
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
between
that
and
telling
him
the
specific
legal
elements
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
suggestion
about
the
intelligence
of
the
accused
may
not
cut
the
other
way.
is
it
not
possible
that
the
more
ignorant
the
man
the
more
important
that
is
that
they
have
the
advise
of
counsel
on
which
to
rely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
here
you
do
have
two
trained
counsels
who
in
effect
made
the
decision
for
him.
so
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
and
made
it
in
intelligent
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
not
at
the
level
of
one
competent
to
stay
in
trial,
it
is
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1965,
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder.
as
a
result
of
a
plea
bargain,
he
plead
guilty
to
a
charge
of
second-degree
murder.
before
entering
his
plea,
he
was
not
informed
by
anyone.
the
prosecutor,
the
new
york
state
trial
judge
or
his
appointed
council
that
an
intent
to
cause
death
was
an
element
of
the
offense
of
second
degree
murder.
for
that
reason
in
a
collateral
attack
on
his
conviction,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
new
york
held
that
his
plea
was
not
an
intelligent
and
voluntary
admission
of
guilt
and
therefore
that
his
conviction
did
not
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirements
of
due
process.
accordingly,
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
issued
which
means
that
he
must
be
given
an
opportunity
by
the
new
york
state
court
to
enter
a
new
plea.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court.
we
granted
certiorari
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
now
affirm
that
judgment.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
joins
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
which
he
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
