unknown
speaker
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
you
read
this
is
in
fact
a
holding
that
the
omission
to
mention
any
element
means
a
guilty
plea
must
be
vacated.
unknown
speaker
there
were
very
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
state
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
error,
and
then
it
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
prevails,
then
what
do
we
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
we
tell
them
the
standards
of
your
right.
we
read
it
as
you
have
suggested
it
should
be
read.
we
say
“no”
there
is
no
per
se
rule;
it’s
totally
or
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
do
we
do
send
it
back
and
let
them
apply
the
rule
as
we
tell
him.
unknown
speaker
if
we
say
it
is
totally
rule
then
we
have
to
apply
the
rule,
said
it?
unknown
speaker
do
we
usually
do
that?
unknown
speaker
were
those
all
of
the
circumstances
as
far
as
he
was
concerned?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
(inaudible)
did
you
stab
a
lady
44
times?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
think
somebody
asking
when
they
ask
him
when
he
said
yes.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
think
mr.
lynch
the
lawyers,
the
two
of
them,
should
have
said
to
him:
“now,
look
young
fellow
second-degree
is
the
plea
that
they
are
asking
you
to
--
let
me
tell
you
what
that
is
all
about
that
involves
intent,
it
involves
this,
it
involves
that,
it
involves
the
other
one.
now
on
this
case,
44
stab
wounds
are
enough
to
establish
intent.
the
jury
could
find
the
intent
on
the
basis
of
that.
now
there
you
are,
that
is
all
the
thing,
how
do
you
want
to
plea
of
them.
you
can
get
from
20
years
to
life.”
is
that
what
they
should
have
done?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
judge
port’s
initial
findings,
it
suggested
that
is
exactly
what
they
said
to
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
mr.
lynch,
but
what
judge
port
did
in
his
initial
opinion,
layout
the
things
that
he
found
had
been
done
at
the
plea
hearing
by
every
one
concerned
the
lawyers,
the
accused,
and
the
judge.
there
are
the
couple
of
paragraphs.
unknown
speaker
i
miss
the
word
intent
i
agree,
but
he
talks
about
what
the
lawyers
did,
he
lays
down
of,
as
i
read
that
on
the
taking
of
the
plea,
the
court
made
a
special
effort
to
emphasize
the
defend
the
gravity
and
importance
to
this
change
of
plea.
the
court
asked
the
defendant
while
he
understood
that
he
was
accused
to
killing
the
victim.
did
the
plea
of
guilty
was
the
same
as
being
convicted
after
jury
trial
and
it
would
be
sentenced
to
prison.
defendant
answered
in
affirmative
to
each
of
these
questions.
unknown
speaker
then
they
ask
him
in
addition
if
he
fully
understood
what
he
was
doing
and
if
he
was
doing
this
voluntarily
and
upon
the
advise
of
counsel.
the
defendant
again
responded
in
the
affirmative
where
other
defendants
mother
and
two
brothers
were
present
with
him
in
the
court
room
and
he
change
this
plea
to
guilty.
as
of
that
is
separate
list
to
what
judge
port
found
on
the
basis
only
the
papers
had
occurred
at
the
taking
of
the
plea.
unknown
speaker
so
even,
if
there
are
some
suggestions
what
i
have
just
read
to
you
that
the
usual
intent
had
been
discus
between
counsels
that
the
after
hearing
the
lawyers
the
judge
concluded
now
he
was
wrong
--.
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
quite
possible
to
read
that
testimony
that
was
confusing
intent
and
pre-meditation,
is
not?
he
testified
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
he
did
have
to
intent
to
kill
her.
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
you
just
that
we
are
not
to
make
these
decisions
on
the
cold
record
when
a
judge
who
actually
had
him
before
him.
unknown
speaker
ask
the
questions
they
heard
his
answers
and
that
