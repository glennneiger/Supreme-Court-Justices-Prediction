mr.
joel
lewittes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
granting
of
a
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
state
prisoners
by
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
northern
district
to
new
york.
wherein,
the
district
court
vacated
a
1965
plea
of
guilty
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
relater,
that
is
the
responded
here,
was
not
informally
advised
of
each
legal
element
of
the
crime
to
which
he
pleaded,
where
the
plea
was
otherwise
unassailable
and
where
the
responded
admitted
the
act
charged.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed
to
that
opinion,
the
granting
of
the
writ.
turning
to
the
facts
for
a
moment,
the
crime
was
committed
on
the
night
of
april
6,
1965,
where
upon
mrs.
ada
francisco,
a
widower,
who
owned
the
farm
where
the
respondent
was
working,
was
brutally
murdered
in
her
home
in
fulton
county
which
is
an
up
state
rural
community
in
new
york
state
by
an
assailant
who
stabbed
her
more
than
40
times.
the
respondent
morgan
was
convicted
of
that
murder
which
occurred
while
he
was
working
on
the
victim’s
farm.
mr.
morgan
at
that
time
was
18
years
old
and
the
record
varies
as
to
his
intelligent
“from
a
range
of
40
to
75”.
it
is
noteworthy
as
we
will
refer
to
later
on
that
at
the
time
of
sentence
there
was
psychiatric
report
on
the
basis
of
the
psychiatric
examination
of
the
utica
state
hospital
that
the
defendant,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
was
competent
to
stay
in
trial,
was
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges,
and
would
able
to
assist
in
the
defense.
the
underlying
altercation
which
resulted
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
here,
was
no
doubt
the
fact
that
the
respondent
originally
was
a
resident
of
the
rome
state
hospital
which
a
division
of
the
new
york
state
mental
hygiene
department
for
young
defectives,
mental
defectives.
apparently
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
he
was
there
as
patient,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
and
apparently
his
record
was
good
enough
so
that
he
was
released
out
to
various
farms
and
particularly
in
this
case
to
the
farm
of
the
decedent
where
he
worked.
and
apparently
his
will,
there
was
a
rule
on
the
part
of
the
rome
state
hospital
that
those
that
were
released
would
have
to
be
home
by
10
o’clock
at
night,
each
night,
and
the
respondent
violated
those
rules
and
mrs.
francisco,
the
decedent,
told
the
respondent
that
he
must
not
to
do
that
again.
he
must
not
violate
the
rules
but
yet
he
did,
and
she
said,
“well,
i
am
going
to
have
to
tell
the
people
of
rome
state
hospital.”
and
the
respondent
fearing
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
returned
to
the
state
hospital
sat
according
to
the
record
bruited
about
it,
and
decided
that
he
was
going
to
leave.
he
went
up
to
mrs.
francisco’s
room
with
a
hunting
knife
in
his
hand.
it
was
not
a
pocket
knife
as
the
record
reveals;
it
is
was
a
hunting
knife
5
inches
long,
went
into
the
room,
awakened
her.
the
decedent
screamed
and
thereupon
the
respondent
stabbed
her
approximately
44
times.
he
ran
away
with
a
small
some
of
money,
fled
in
the
decedent’s
car,
drove
about
a
hundred
miles
away
was
involved
in
a
head
on
collusion
with
another
car,
and
was
taken
into
the
hospital
whereupon
he
was
arrested
based
upon
the
description
of
the
respondent
that
they
were
looking
for
him.
they
did
find
the
hunting
knife
in
the
car
and
confessions
were
made,
the
record
shows.
he
was
arraigned
about
nine
days
afterwards
to
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
at
which
time
the
judge
at
the
arraignment
proceeding
assigned
to
him
two
counsel,
two
lawyers.
the
indictment,
murder
one,
was
read
to
him
in
open
court.
he
was
advised
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
have
the
right
to
subpoena
witnesses,
on
his
behalf
to
produce
any
evidence,
necessary
for
the
defense.
the
attorney’s
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment
requested
that
the
respondent
be
examined
psychiatrically.
this
was
granted
by
the
court.
the
attorney’s
also
informed
the
court
that
they
would
moved
at
that
time
to
obtained
copies
of
various
statements
made
by
the
respondent
to
the
police
into
the
district
attorney’s
office.
that
was
on
april
of
1965,
on
june
8,
1965
respondent
in
fact
pleaded
guilty
to
murder
on
the
second-degree
upon
the
recommendation
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
request
of
the
respondent.
defense
counsel
was
present
at
that
time,
those
were
members
of
the
family.
the
trial
court
was
quite
aware
of
the
limited
intelligence
of
the
respondent
and
the
record
shows,
the
plea
minutes
too
demonstrate,
the
solitude
taken
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
that
is
way
statute
read
in
1965.
it
has
subsequently
had
been
changed
your
honor,
but
at
that
time,
murder
in
the
first
degree
required
premeditation
and
deliberation
with
intent,
a
murder
in
a
second
just
required
an
intent
to
affect
the
design
to
kill.
the
respondent
at
the
time
of
plea,
admitted
he
had
consulted
with
his
attorney
and
that
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
go
on
the
prison,
and
seven
days
later,
the
sentence
was
imposed
and
ended
termed
25
years
to
life.
the
actual
minimum
amount
under
the
statute
for
murder
in
the
second
degree
at
that
time
was
20
years
to
life.
there
was
a
plea
for
leniency
on
the
part
of
the
defense
and
before
passing
sentence,
the
court
did
note
as
it
is
required
and
was
required
of
that
time
in
new
york
state
that
prior
to
sentence,
the
trial
judge
must
have
before
he
may
present
his
report
in
a
social
history
report,
and
he
did
have
the
report
of
the
psychiatrist.
it
is
noteworthy
as
well
that
at
the
time
of
sentence
there
was
no
surprised
or
disappointment
either
by
defense
counsel
or
by
the
respondent
when
the
sentence
was
pronounced.
well,
all
was
quite
for
five
years,
and
five
years
after
the
conviction,
coram
nobis
application
was
commenced
by
this
respondent,
and
for
the
first
time,
he
now
alleged
this
his
plea
was
involuntary
because
he
was
unaware
of
the
consequences
of
the
plea,
and
he
was
unaware
that
intent
was
an
element
of
murder
in
the
second-degree.
supreme
court
in
fulton
county
denied
the
writ
without
a
hearing.
it
determined
that
indeed
it
was
voluntary
that
he
did
have
counsel
that
he
had
spoken
to
counsel
about
it,
and
it
was
voluntarily
and
knowingly
made.
the
state
coram
nobis
denial
was
affirmed
unanimously
without
opinion
by
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
in
new
york
state
and
leave
to
appeal
was
denied
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
on
july
6,
1972.
then
following
the
procedure
that
is
quite
familiar
in
my
office,
the
state
inmate
then
proceeded
by
way
of
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
it
was
time
in
the
district
court,
in
northern
district
of
new
york.
and
he
raised
the
same
issues
that
he
raised
in
the
state
coram
nobis
proceeding,
they
had
failed
to
ascertain,
the
trial
court
failed
test
ascertain
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea
and
that
he
was
not
told
with
the
elements
of
the
crime
to
which
he
pleaded
where
the
consequences
of
it.
the
district
court
denied
the
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
not
unlike
the
decision
in
coram
nobis
that
actually
tracked
the
decision
of
the
state
coram
nobis
within
state
court
termination,
and
district
court
held
that
the
plea
was
indeed
voluntary.
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
was
granted
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
they
reversed
or
remanded
on
they
say
without
any
request
for
opposition
by
the
state
to
put
in
opposition
papers
on
the
certificate
of
a
probable
cause
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
was
not
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
did
not
know
at
that
time.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
believe
that
it
does.
i
may
say
this
is
in
all
candor,
however,
that
when
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
is
granted,
we
did
move
for
rehearing
of
that
which
is
denied.
the
second
circuit
reversal
and
remand
was
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
be
held
in
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
allegation
is
raise
of
the
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
application.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
can
say
justice
brennan
that
there
is
no
hard
and
fast
rule.
i
usually
find
my
experience
is
that
where
the
relater
is
defended
by
counsel
as
opposed
to
pro
se,
when
he
is
defended
by
counsel,
we
do
get
notice
of
it.
but
usually
in
the
pro
se
applications
it
is
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
the
pro
se
clerk,
and
then
so
the
judges
and
we
do
not
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
in
the
second
circuit
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
very
often
we
do
not
get
any
notice
of
it
until
the
denial
or
the
commission
so
proceed.
mr.
joel
lewittes
not
when
it
comes
to
certificate
of
probable
cause
in
most
cases.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
they
usually
remand
it.
mr.
joel
lewittes
oh
i
am
sorry,
i
am
sorry.
they
do
grant
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
then,
we
are
--
counsels
then
usually
assigned
if
there
is
no
counsel
at
that
time
and
then
the
appeal
proceeds
normally.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
do.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
find
no
disagreement
with
the
statements
at
all.
my
disagreement
is
with
the
application
thereafter,
in
spite
of
that
statement
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
--
the
district
court
when
on
and
did
formulate
the
per
se
rule.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
not
in
agreement.
on
page
8a
of
the
appendix,
and
this
is
to
the
petitions,
the
court
cites
the
statement
mccarthy
and
then
says,
based
on
upon
the
foregoing,
i
hold
this
is
a
matter
of
law,
that
petitioner
plead
guilty
was
not
intelligently
and
knowingly
entered.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
spite
of
the
general
statement
at
the
beginning
of
the
decision,
it
is
clear
indeed
and
it
is
seem
also
in
light
of
the
fact
in
the
remand
order
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
holding
was
indeed
that
this
was
a
per
se
rule
that
but
for
that
it
would
have
been
voluntary.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
case.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
i
might
be,
because
if
read
that
i
hold
is
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
petitioner’s
plead
guilty
was
not
intelligently
or
knowingly
entered
and
was
therefore
involuntary.
i
still
would
fear
that
mere
fact,
rather
than
the
use
of
the
word
law,
still
could
render
a
guilty
plea
involuntary.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
there
was
this
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
basis
of
the
remand
where
the
relater,
the
respondent
here,
did
testified
the,
two
defense
counsel
testified
the
district
attorney
testified,
and
although
technically
not
made
part
of
the
rule
52a,
conclusions
of
law
and
findings
of
fact.
the
court
did
note
that
indeed
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
but
did
hold
as
mentioned
moment
ago
that
a
mere
fact
in
essence
that
the
element
was
not
of
the
crime,
was
not
told
to
this
respondent,
the
plea
was
involuntarily
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
district
court
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
have
assumed,
they
read
out
a
harmless
error
here.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
that
is
the
way
we
read
this
decision
and
that
is
the
evil
of
this
decision
we
feel.
now,
that
the
decision
itself
from
the
district
court
is
quite
odd,
it
seems
to
me,
particularly
when
they
commence
their
discussion
of
the
law
citing
boykin
against
alabama,
and
they
claim
it
is
not
applicable
to
the
instant
case
because
boykin
is
not
retroactive.
and
yet,
they
rely
upon
the
mccarthy
case
which
was
held
not
to
be
retroactive,
and
the
halliday
decision
in
this
court,
and
yet
they
have
based
their
reliance
upon
the
mccarthy
against
the
united
states
which
was,
of
course,
decided
under
the
supervisory
powers
of
this
court.
so
that
it
is
a
strange
decision
even
on
that
basis.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
i
think
the
opposite
was
truly
--
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
he
was
very
much
influenced
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
joel
lewittes
in
my
judgment,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
if
we
look
at
page
8a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
says
there
that
citing
mccarthy
can
not
be
truly
voluntary
unless
the
defendant
possess
and
understanding
of
the
law
relation
of
the
facts.
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
do
not.
mr.
joel
lewittes
very
much
serves,
and
i
believe
that
the
fear
that
justice
harlan
related
in
boykin
case
in
his
dissent
that
rule
11
was
--
excuse
me.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
the
court
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
i
would
make
this
argument
even
if
it
were
post
boykin
because
i
think
that
we
can
not
isolate
one
single
element
and
say,
and
fashion
a
per
se
rule,
and
i
think
the
court
decisions
in
brady
and
mcmann
against
richardson,
and
in
the
output
case
tell
us
that
we
have
to
look
at
all
the
relevant
circumstances.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
boykin
rule
when
there
is
no
factual
basis
for
the
plea
in
conjunction
with
not
understanding
the
nature
of
the
plea
plus
the
fact
that
it
must
be
intelligently
and
knowingly
made.
so
what
i
am
saying
in
essence
is
that
it
must
be
a
voluntary
statement,
it
must
be
consensual.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
think
if
we
set
it
that
way
we
have
a
problem,
because
it
we
can
not
communicate
to
the
defendant
in
essence
the
element
of
the
crime
without
formally
using
the
statutory
phrase.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct!
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
it
does
not,
except
that
i
think
--
except
that
i
think
many
of
cases
that
have
followed
boykin
assumed,
some
of
the
cases
assumed
that
they
are
constitutional
requirements,
although
that
flow
out
of
boykin
through
mccarthy.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
there
was
no
record
at
all
on
the
boykin
case.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
think
that
in
itself
would
change
my
view,
because
if
the
motivation
behind
the
plea
was,
for
example,
that
he
--
and
there
are
several
reasons
why
one
pleads
guilty,
but
one
maybe
that
he
still
felt
that
he
wants
a
shorter
sentence
and
sentences
are
very
important
motivation
or
perhaps
the
most
important
motivation.
i
think
that
even
if
he
did
not
understand
the
element
but
he
understood
that
he
would
get
a
lower
sentence
and
there
would
be
less
penalty
imposed
and
he
pleaded
because
of
that,
i
do
not
believe
the
guilty
plea
would
be
infirm.
mr.
joel
lewittes
he
could
have
had
a
mandatory
sentence
of
life
on
a
murder
one
conviction
at
that
time.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
a
maximum
was
life
but
the
minimum
was
20
years.
he
received
25
here
to
life.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
believe
they
do.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
believe
it
as
well,
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
was
the
assessment
of
his
counsel,
but
that
would
be
the
problem
if
he
had
to
go
trial
but
no
jury
would
believe
that
there
was
no
intent
here.
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
would
be
appear
to
be
and
more
--
yes,
it
would
and
i
am
disturbed
by
that
for
many
reasons,
because
i
think
that
the
rule
11
goes
some
extent
to
the
tools
to
be
used
by
a
judge.
these
are
tools
in
ascertaining
voluntariness.
they
do
not
necessarily
go
to
voluntariness
itself.
but
this
case
of
all
cases
we
believe,
it
is
a
perfect
example
not
to
have
any
per
se
rule.
this
was
the
case
where
the
man
was
very
happy
to
get
away
of
what
he
did
sentence
wise.
he
entered
the
room
with
a
knife
and
the
multiple
stab
wounds,
and
to
omit
a
per
se
rule
here
would
not
only
to
substantial
harm
as
far
as
criminal
administration
is
concerned.
but
i
should
like
to
tell
the
court
and
i
am
sure
we
are
all
aware
that
there
hardly
a
guilty
plea
entered
or
has
been
entered,
where
the
legal
elements
would
necessarily
toll
to
the
defendant.
so
i
can
imagine
the
plethora
of
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
will
succeed
after
this.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
we
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
and
this
is
one
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
we
--
i
think
you
could
reverse,
just
plain
reverse.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
i
think
you
do.
in
the
case
where
there
was
evidentiary
hearing
and
the,
i
think
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
ends
and
the
fact
that
they
relater
waited
five
years
before
he
suddenly
discover
this.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
