justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
i
ask
a
question?
in
your
brief
and
in
your
petition,
as
i
understand
it,
you
take
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
second
circuit
adopted
per
se
rule.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do.
and
yet
if
i
am
reading
the
district
court’s
opinion
correctly,
on
page
6a
of
your
petition
for
a
writ,
bottom
of
page
6a,
the
judge
under
caption
entitled
the
law
cites
black
in
the
first
sentence
and
then
says,
“the
standard
to
be
applied
to
the
plea
of
guilty
herein
is
whether
under
all
of
the
circumstances,
the
petitioner
made
a
reason
choice
voluntarily
after
proper
advise
and
with
a
full
understanding
of
the
consequences”.
do
you
find
any
fault
with
that
statement
of
standard?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
the
district
court
may
have
decided
the
facts
incorrectly
but
court
said
and
stated
the
rule
correctly
as
you
just
conceded,
so
they
would
be
no
precedent
against
you,
would
it?
