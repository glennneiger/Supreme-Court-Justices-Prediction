we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1529

any
procedure
comparable
to
an
order
to
show
cause
directed
to
your
office,
why
release
should
not
be
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
relying
on
the
mccarthy
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
give
me
your
view
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
new
york
state
county
has,
in
the
way
of
a
counterpart,
rule
11
of
the
federal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
inherent
the
applying
rule
11
as
a
judicially
constructed
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
maximum,
but
he
could
not
get
under
new
york
law,
life.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
suggest
now
or
at
least
i
got
an
inference
that
was
44
stab
wounds
the
intent
element
is
really
not
an
element
in
the
case,
that
any
trier,
in
fact,
could
reasonably
assume
that
if
you
stab
somebody
44
times
you
intended
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
impact
to
this
holding
now
that
all
the
state
courts
and
the
second
circuit
are
bound
by
rule
11?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
that
have
passed
on
this
event.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pretty
good
record
made.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
satisfied
--
he
was
satisfied
for
a
while
with
his
sentence
but
not
after
a
while.

mr.
joseph
e.
lynch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
that
(inaudible)
circumstances
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
second
circuit
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
explain
the
court
relying
on
rule
11
in
the
mccarthy
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mccarthy
decided
in
the
opinion,
it
is
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
crucial
elements
of
those
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
starting
i
suppose
with
the
fact
that
he
had
counsel
or
you
would
concede
that
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
to
inquire
whether
this
was
experience
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
its
passes
those
two
tests
here?
chief

e.
burger
first
time
or
the
second
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
did
that
twice;
he
did
that
twice.
first
time
he
came
up
black
and
the
next
time
he
came
up
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
probably
showed
that
this
man
stabbed
the
victim
44
times
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
pretty
important
the
element
of
intent
is
it
not?
you
have
already
conceded.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hold
in
the
appraisal
of
a
defendant
and
his
lawyers
as
to
how
he
should
plea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
concede
that
without
the
any
doubt
as
you
apparently
have
that
the
state
could
make
a
case
of
intent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
how
is
the
degree
of
his
understanding
of
this,
a
layman’s
understanding
of
this,
assuming
of
perfectly
average
intelligent
person
not
a
subnormal
as
he
is,
what
would
that
have
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
realistic
matter
such
a
person,
a
layman,
on
that
kind
of
an
issue,
depend
almost
entirely
on
his
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
effects
would
be
more
subtle
than
whether
44
stab
wounds
afford
a
basis
for
an
inference
of
intent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
analogy,
the
court
might
have
reached
that
conclusion
very
properly,
if
this
young
fellow
had
been
pleading
guilty
to
conspiracy
given
all
the
other
facts.
but
when
his
pleading
becomes
something
very
much
less
subtle
than
conspiracy,
doesn’t
the
explanation
–isn’t
the
explanation
to
be
tailored
to
the
nature
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
sentence
would
reduce
to
20
years,
would
that
wash
this
case
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
you
get
25
instead
of
20
years,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the

74-1529
henderson
against
