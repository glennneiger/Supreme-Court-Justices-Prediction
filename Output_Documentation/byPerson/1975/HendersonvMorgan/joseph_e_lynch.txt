mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
sitting
on
the
court
room
the
portion
of
the
last
two
days
i
have
instruct
by
what
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
significant
difference
between
this
law
suit
and
the
cases
i
have
heard
and
i
suppose
when
it
the
cases
it
come
here.
in
those
cases,
the
party’s
are
in
disagreement
about
what
the
law
is.
there
is
no
such
disagreement
here.
we
all
recognize
that
under
our
system
of
justice
are
probably
under
any
unlike
system
of
justice
or
a
plea
of
guilt
to
a
crime
to
be
valid
and
must
be
intelligent
act.
it
must
be
done
by
a
person
who
realizes
his
significance
in
quite
consequences
of
that
act.
both
parties
also
agree
that
when
the
question
is
whether
a
particular
plea
meets
that
standard
that
the
judge
charge
with
the
determinate
question
was
looking
all
of
the
circumstances
that
surround
the
plea.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
in
this
case,
very
definitely
your
honor,
if
i
may
explain.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
no,
i
do
not
think
that
this
case
stands
for
proposition
as
counsel
has
suggested
that
this
means
that
every
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
the
opinion
says
that
the
plea
must
be
voluntary.
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
this,
vis-a-vis
kercheval
and
machibroda,
the
plea
must
be
voluntary,
that
in
deciding
whether
it
is
voluntary
the
court
can
and
must
look
at
the
circumstances
it
is
surrounded,
and
i
say
that
that
is
what
they
did
here.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
would
be
pertinent
very
definitely
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
conduct
of
the
defense
counsel
here.
they
did
certainly
as
good
a
job
as
i
could
have
done
and
well
that
may
not
be
a
very
adequate
standard.
it
compels
me
to
say
that
they
did
a
good
job.
i
think
the
other
circumstances
that
are
included
here
and
that
were
before
the
court
and
which
i
say
that
the
court
must
have
taken
into
consideration
was
the
age
of
the
accused,
the
fact
that
prior
to
this
particular
problem
he
had
had
no
serious
crushes
with
the
law
and,
therefore,
was
not
presumably
familiar
as
harden
criminals
are
familiar
with
the
judicial
process,
and
of
course,
very
importantly
the
diminished
intellectual
quotient
of
the
accused.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
it
certainly
suggests
that
the
second
circuit
thought
it
was
important,
but
that
does
not
mean
i
believe
that
in
deciding
this
case
judge
port
looked
only
at
that
issue.
you
see,
i
think
where
the
parties
part
company
here
and
where
the
disagreement
arises
is
that
petitioners
says
to
this
court
that
there
was
only
one
factor
that
decided
the
outcome
of
this
case,
namely
the
effect
that
this
young
man
did
not
known
that
intent
was
an
element
of
the
crime.
and
let
me
say,
so
i
do
not
forget
it
parenthetically,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
there
is
all
kinds
of
intent
in
this
case.
if
this
went
to
a
jury,
a
jury
clearly
could
have
found
to
intent
in
the
number
of
wounds.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
because
in
judge
port’s
original
decision
there
had
been
no
evidentiary
hearing.
after
the
second
circuit
decision,
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing.
for
the
first
time
the
judge
saw
this
young
man;
he
heard
testimony
not
only
from
this
young
man
but
from
the
other
people,
and
it
is
this
type
of
thing
that
creates
the
additional
circumstances
which
i
contend
he
took
in
the
consideration.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
oh
no!
that
is
true.
well,
he
does
not
say
that
he
does
--
he
did
acceptance
so
far
as
he
says
i
am
going
to
apply
the
totally
of
circumstance
rule.
when
he
talks
about
the
law
that
he
is
going
to
apply,
he
says
that
he
is
going
to
use
the
very
standard
that
the
petitioners
says,
he
should
use.
you
see
what
the
petitioner
says
here
as
i
understand
his
argument
and
i
am
reading
his
brief.
everything
he
says
is
premised
in
one
simple
conclusion
and
that
conclusion
is
that
since
the
opinion
talks
about
nothing
except
intent
of
necessity,
it
must
be
only
intent
that
dictated
the
decision.
now,
i
think
that
is
logically
wrong
and
unpersuasive
when
the
court
says
“i
am
not
going
just
consider
this
on
the
element
of
intent
but
i
am
going
to
look
at
all
of
the
surroundings
circumstances”.
i
think
it
is
also
significant
when
those
circumstances
are
as
important
and
as
significant
as
they
are
here
and,
of
course,
i
am
thinking
about
the
intellectual
level
of
this
young
man
particular.
really
that
premise
that
if
it
is
not
cited,
it
is
not
considered,
i
suppose
has
a
corollary
that
it
is
says
that
if
you
are
writing
decisions,
you
must
put
in
the
decision
what
you
consider
to
be
significant,
because
if
you
do
not
it
will
be
assumed
that
you
have
not
considered
it.
and
that
--
well,
i
think
the
premises
are
illogical,
i
think
that
corollary
is
potentially
catastrophic,
and
i
would
assume
it
makes
the
writing
of
opinions
even
more
chancy
than
i
suppose
they
are
without
that
corollary.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
under
the
federal
rules
as
i
understand
them
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes,
i
think
you
may
assumed
that
i
would
like
to
have
you
also
assume
what
i
think
is
a
valid
assumption
that
when
a
judge
says
i
am
going
to
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
circumstances
that
is
what
he
does.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
he
wrote
solely
in
terms
of
intent.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
the
second
intent.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
well,
you
see
i
find
difficulty
accepting
that
your
honor,
because
--
well,
stop
and
think
a
second,
isn’t
in
any
adversary
proceeding
isn’t
one
of
the
most
significant
things
that
takes
place
throughout
the
preceding,
is
it
not
the
presence
of
the
witnesses,
the
appearance,
the
impression
they
create,
their
integrity,
their
ability
to
honestly
recall
and
relate.
that
is
present
in
every
preceding,
and
it
was
present
here,
and
it
is
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
this
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
decision
rest
only
on
the
element
of
intent
overlooks
the
facts
that
this
judge
saw
these
witnesses,
came
to
the
conclusion
as
to
what
their
are
testimony
was
and
to
what
the
facts
were
and
fact
that
he
entered
in
the
decision
that
he
rendered
here.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
no,
if
i
may
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
time
there
was
no
hearing.
all
he
had
in
front
of
him
on
the
first
occasion
were
papers.
on
the
second
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
true.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
conceded,
and
the
issue
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
vital,
if
it
went
to
a
jury
for
determination.
there
is
no
question
they
could
have
found
intent
here.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
as
i
understand
the
issue
here,
it
is
not
whether
he
had
they
intent
but
it
is
whether
he
knew
that
the
state
had
to
prove
he
had
the
intent.
he
says
that
he
did
not
--
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
different
proposition.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
no
question.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
does
that
not
really
go
to
the
very
question
we
are
trying
to
resolve
whether
the
plea
is
voluntary
and
intelligent.
in
other
words,
how
can
a
person
make
an
intelligent
decision
as
to
what
he
should
do
under
these
circumstances,
if
he
does
not
know
that
one
of
the
problems
that
the
people
face
here
is
that
they
must
prove
that
he
had
intent?
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes,
but
you
see
here
your
honor,
the
counsel
quite
candidly
admitted
that
--
and
i
do
not
denigrate
them
for
this;
one
counsel
said
that
he
had
not
told
this
to
the
--
not
told
the
accused
that
intent
was
an
element
of
this
matter,
and
the
other
counsel
said
that
he
thought
of
what
he
could
not
be
sure
and
accused
himself
testified
that
he
had
never
been
told.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
agree
with
that.
i
would
not
dwell
on
it,
particularly,
whereas
here
my
client
had
very
limited
ability
to
understand.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
i
--
well,
i
might
not
dwell
on
it.
i
think
i
have
to
tell
it
to
him.
so
that
there
maybe
some
inconsistency
in
saying
that
an
accused
who
is
at
some
place
between
an
idiot
and
a
moron,
must
be
told
the
--
i
must
saying
he
has
to
be
told
the
elements
of
crime;
i
think
he
has
to
be
told
the
substance
of
the
crime,
and
i
think,
that
was
not
told
to
him
here,
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
circumstances
that
resolved
in
this
decision.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
well,
that
is
true
and
we
are
not
saying
in
this
preceding
that
he
was
not
capable
of
understanding.
in
fact,
the
irony
of
this
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
yes.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
technically
true,
but
i
think
it
would
be
practically
sufficient
because
i
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
but
you
see
that
they
did
not
tell
them
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
well,
you
see
that
is
what
i
am
really
saying.
perhaps
my
answer
to
your
original
question
was
they
will
conceive
what
the
--
what
i
am
saying
here
is
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
the
plea
must
be
an
intelligent
plea.
now,
they
will
obviously
assume
that
the
person
making
that
plea
has
some
knowledge.
i
mean
that,
mr.
morgan
were
from
another
planet
and
you
know
came
down
and
was
charged
and
had
no
knowledge
of
our
society
or
our
rules
whatsoever.
i
think
that
that
we
would
have
to
impart
some
knowledge
to
him.
now
the
question
turns,
what
kind
of
knowledge
must
you
impart
for
the
plea
to
be
an
intelligent
act?
and
what
i
suggest
is
that
what
you
must
tell
in
accused
for
his
plea
to
be
an
intelligent
act
is
the
substance
--
the
essential
substance
of
the
crime
of
with
which
he
is
charged.
now
i
do
not
wish
to
get
into
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
well,
let
me
explain.
there
are
number
of
cases
as
i
am
sure
your
honors
aware
where
pleas
have
been
set
aside
because
the
accused
did
not
understand
the
nature
what
he
was
doing.
now,
these
have
tended
to
fall
and
may
exclusively
fall
under
the
conspiracy
area.
the
courts
have
said
in
those
matters,
because
the
accused
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing;
he
did
not
know
in
effect
what
a
conspiracy
was,
we
are
not
going
to
accept
his
plea
and
we
are
going
to
send
it
back
for
re-pleading.
i
take
those
cases
to
mean
that
for
an
accused
to
plead
intelligently
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
requirements
of
due
process,
he
must
know
the
essential
substance
of
the
crime.
the
essential
substance
of
conspiracy,
i
take
it,
is
that
two
or
more
people
get
together
to
commit
a
crime.
the
essential
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
well,
it
maybe
more
subtle,
in
fact
the
petitioner
has
suggested
that
the
conspiracy
cases
that
have
set
aside
plea
should
be
considered
--
he
does
not
phrase
it
this
way,
but
i
gather
a
short
of
an
aberration
in
this
system
that
those
are
complex
cases,
and
therefore,
it
can
be
understood
only
in
that
light.
i
prefer
to
think
of
them
as
i
think
that
they
are,
not
an
aberration
but
an
actual
practical
example
of
the
principle
of
the
rule
which
says
that
he
accused
must
know.
now,
a
conspiracy
case
complex
as
it
may
or
it
may
not
be.
the
plea
to
such
a
charge
may
not
necessarily
have
to
be
set
aside
because
the
accused
is
not
told.
in
fact,
as
i
recall,
i
think
it
is
the,
i
want
to
say
podell
case,
the
podell
case.
there
the
case
went
through
partly
to
trial.
the
accused
was
an
attorney,
pleaded
guilty
and
then
moved
to
separate
plea
aside
and
a
grounds
he
did
not
--
not
that
he
did
not
understand
but
to
be
was
not
told
the
element
of
conspiracy
and
the
court
had
no
problems
that
will
--
this
is
as
sophisticated
and
intelligent
man
and
he
does
not
need
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
think
it
is
to
be
tailored
to
the
nature
of
the
accused,
because
i
think
that
a
sophisticated
accused
may
need
no
explanation.
certainly
the
attorney
example
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
he
requires
no
explanation.
the
unsophisticated
or
the
mentally
deficient,
i
think
need
a
lot
more.
if
the
standard
is
a
complexity
of
the
crime,
does
not
that
necessarily
pre
suppose
that
you
make
a
list
of
the
crimes
in
terms
in
order
complexity,
and
that
seems
to
me
like
an
unworkerable
judicial
rule.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
would
accept
that.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
let
me
say
quite
candidly
that
they
made
the
decision,
i
am
sure
that
i
would
assume
suggest
if
you
made.
there’s
no
way
through
there.
but
the
issue
really
is
not
what
they
did
what
was
right
or
wrong,
but
whether
this
was
an
intelligent
plea.
now,
there
are
problems
both
ways,
i
mean,
do
you
have
a
young
man
of
very
limited
intellectual
ability
and
i
suppose
it
can
be
said
well
with
such
a
person
is
not
really
unwise
to
say
you
must
tell
him
in
great
detail
what
the
substance
of
the
crime
is.
on
the
other
hand,
this
has
been
pointed
out,
he
has
been
found
able
to
stay
in
trial.
he
is
able
to
understand
apparently
enough
to
go
to
trial
and
it
is
seems
to
me
that
the
due
process
provisions
of
our
constitution
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
it
his
plea
is
to
be
an
intelligent
one,
it
has
to
be
made
on
a
basis
of
some
knowledge.
he
is
not
just
a
chip
in
a
whirlwind
of
legal
knowledge
here.
he
has
to
make
an
intelligent
decision
of
his
own
and
he
has
to
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
think
that
he
should
have
gone
on
and
if
he
had
answer
such
question—
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
would
not
consider
that
giving
him
information
he
need
it
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
because
the—when
i
talk
of
substance
of
the
crime
you
honor.
i
am
talking
about
the
element
without
which
the
crime
would
not
be
the
same.
now,
when
you
are
talking
about
murder
second,
the
very
thing
that
is
distinguishes
it
from
the
lesser
degrees
of
homicide
is
the
intent
to
cause
the
death.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
think
that
that
is
the
least
they
should
have
done
yet.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
no.
you
see,
i
would
hope
that
court
not
go
off
on
the
original
decision.
the
original
decision
was
decided
and
papers
submitted
solely
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
in
so
far
is
that
was
contained
in
the
court
records.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
reason
at
decision
was
different
on
second
occasion
in
my
judgment.
its
ironically
enough
the
presence
of
the
defense
counsel
testifying
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
think,
it
is
very
possible
that
if
those
counsel
would
not
have
not
been
present
and
if
the
court
had
not
have
enough
opportunity
see
the
witnesses,
it
would
come
into
different—different
results.
the
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
i
think,
that
after
hearing
not
only
the
lawyers
but
of
course
the
accused
himself,
the
court
had
a
complete
picture
of
what
--
not
only
what
went
on,
that
was
in
the
records
originally.
but
he
could
better
understand
the
intellectual
deficiency
of
the
accused
and
could
recognize
as
i
think
he
did
recognized
based
upon
at
deficiency,
that
he
accused
did
not
know
that
intent
was
an
element.
and
it
is,
you
know,
it
is
very
well
for
us
to
say
that
he
should
have
known,
i
mean
that
intent
was
so
obvious,
and
it
is
obvious
here
but
this
young
man
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
he
not
intent
to
kill
this
one.
now,
you
know,
let
me
find
it
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
possible
--
there
is
one
possible
explanation
of
the
testimony
your
honor,
that
is
true.
i
think,
it
is
also
possible
to
interpret
that
testimony
to
mean,
that
he
actually
believe
he
did
not
intent.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
was
he
said.
and
when
you
are
dealing
--
now
at
this
we
are
perfectly
rational
human
being,
normal
human
being,
i
would
agree
that
that
is
testimony
is
incredible
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
am
not
sure
is
not
incredible
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
person
of
this—of
this
intellectual
level
or
lack
of
that,
really.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
he
was
competent
found
to
be
competent,
and
i
can
say
candidly
that
i
was
surprise
in
my
discussion
with
them
at
the
level
of
his
understanding
at
that
time.
i
think
that
if
have
been
told
that
intent
was
element
of
the
crime,
i
am
sure
he
could
have
understood
it
and
he
says
we
would
not
plea
that
if
had
them
so
told.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
feel
that
there
is
clearly
a
question
of
fact,
like
what
i
have
cited
the
brady
case
with
the
proposition
that
to
question
of
voluntariness
of
the
guilty
plea
is
always
a
question
of
fact
and
it
obviously
only
the
judge
it
sees
the
witness
and
hears
the
testimonies
in
a
position
to
make
that
judgment.
i
would
ask
that
you
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
unless
you
have
any
other
question
out.
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
well,
it
might
watch
the
case
all
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
do
anything
with
your
principle
your
honor.
you
see
the
--
mr.
joseph
e.
lynch
well,
actually
i
am
not
sure
he
is
even
complaining
about
that.
honestly,
i
have
just
been
advised
that
he
is
on
the
street
on
parole.
you
see,
i
do
not
think
this
stands
for
the
proposition
in
this
decision
that
there
has
to
be
a
legalistic
mechanistic
formalistic
recitation
of
every
element
of
the
crime
to
an
accused.
at
the
very
most
this
decision
stands
for
the
proposition.
if
you
say
he
did
consider
another
single
thing,
at
the
very
most
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
person
is
charged
with
murder
in
second
degree,
he
must
know
that
intent
is
an
element
of
that
crime,
and
that
he
must
not
--
that
that
information
may
not
come
to
him
from
the
horrendous
nature
of
the
crime.
it
has
got
come
to
him
by
someone
who
is
in
a
position
that
to
tell
him
this
is
the
element.
that
is
the
only
element
that
was
talked
about
here.
there
are
cases
as
the
court
realizes
where
people
for
example
have
been
found
guilty
of
postal
robbery
and
they
attempt
to
set
--
and
not
found
guilty,
pleaded
guilty
of
postal
robbery.
they
attempt
to
set
the
plea
aside
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
explained
to
them
that
to
commit
this
crime,
you
will
have
to
have
to
put
life
in
danger,
you
have
to
use
a
dangerous
weapon
and
put
life
in
danger,
and
there
are
certain
presumptions
as
to
whether
a
weapon
is
dangerous,
whether
ti
is
loaded
or
not.
the
court
had
no
problem
with
that
they
said
no,
you
do
not
have
to
know
all
that,
you
do
not
have
to
be
told
all
that,
but
that
i
take
its
different
when
you
are
talking
the
element
of
intent
in
a
murder
second
charge.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors
