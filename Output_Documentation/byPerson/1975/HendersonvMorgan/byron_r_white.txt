justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
the
court
has
held
anytime
you
fail
do
advise
a
person
of
an
element
of
the
crime
that
it
automatically
means
that
the
plea
not
voluntary.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
would
be
making
the
same
arguments
this
was
post
boykin
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
--
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
the
district
court
said
that
this
is
a
pre
boykin
case
and
to
be
judge
by
pre
boykin
standards.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
not
say
that
it
is
never
a
violation
of
the
boykin
rule
to
put
on
the
record
reasonable
--
and
make
a
reasonable
showing
on
the
record
that
if
plea
is
intelligent
and
voluntary
to
--
you
would
not
say
it
is
never
a
violation
that
rule
to
fail
to
informing
of
an
element
of
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
of
that
but
how
about
not
knowing
an
element
of
the
crime
that
is
your
pleading
guilty
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
is
the
boykin
rule
before,
i
gather
to
think
it
would
be
true.
you
do
not
--
i
guess
you
think
the
rule
is
the
same
after
than
as
before
boykin.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
boykin
is
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
if
boykin
made
though
--
was
it
the
requirement
of
having
on
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
suppose
you
believe
after
boykin
or
before
or
suppose
you
agree
that
it
is
been
shown
that
the
defendant
was
actually
ignorant
of
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
to
which
she
was
pleading
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
can
say
that
is
just
the
other
side
of
the
--
but
requiring
on
guilty
plea
--
you
are
supposed
to
put
on
the
record
if
the
elements
that
go
to
guilty
plea.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
under
boykin
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
boykin,
and
so
may
we
assume
that
the
judge
put
up
record
the
elements
that
he
relied
on
in
overturning
the
guilty
plea?
he
was
supposed
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
