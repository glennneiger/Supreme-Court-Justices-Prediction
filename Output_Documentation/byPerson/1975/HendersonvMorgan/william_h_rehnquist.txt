justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewittes,
does
the
new
york
make
what
i
think
of
as
a
customary
distinction
between
the
first-degree
murder
and
the
second-degree
murder
that
first
degree
would
require
a
predisposition
as
well
as
intent,
while
at
second-degree
intent
would
be
sufficient
without
predisposition
or
premeditation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
not
orally
argued.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
significant
number
of
occasions
grant
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
but
not
decide
the
case,
set
it
down
for
oral
argument
after
granting
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
they
grant
a
certificate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
this
would
be
the
extraordinary
procedure,
the
one
followed
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
read
that
district
court’s
opinions,
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
was
reading
out
any
possibility
of
harmless
error
in
a
situation
like
this,
i
would
think
where
the
defendant
had
stabbed
the
victim
40
times.
whether
he
knew
as
a
matter
of
law
that
intent
had
to
be
proved
or
not,
might
be
fairly
in
material
since
i
would
think
that
jury
confronted
with
that
evidence
would
virtually
inevitably
conclude
that
there
was
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
think
there
is
some
possibility
that
judge
port
(ph)
may
not
have
been
internally
persuaded
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lynch,
judge
port
originally
found
that
it
had
been
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
plea,
and
then
the
second
circuit
reversed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
at
page
10
that
very
short
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
or
at
page
10a
of
your
petition.
all
they
say
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
issues
raised
by
the
petitioner
including
whether
at
the
time
of
his
entry
of
his
guilty
plea,
he
was
aware
that
intent
was
essential
element
of
the
crime.
now,
does
that
not
suggest
that
the
second
circuit
thought
that
fact
might
have
been
dispositive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
let
me
interruption
you
and
then
go
ahead
and
answer
as
much.
judge
port
originally
found
that
to
be
voluntary
and
advised,
it
goes
up
to
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
says
take
it
back
and
consider
whether
he
knew
intent
was
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
and
whether
was
advised
to
the
scope
there
punishment.
it
goes
back
to
judge
port..
judge
port
says
he
was
advised
to
the
scope
of
the
punishment.
he
did
not
know
that
intent
was
an
element
of
a
crime
and
judge
port
releases
him.
now,
to
judge
port,
that
was
dispositive
what
the
second
circuit
said
about
to
intent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
does
not
say
he
did
though.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
that
not
one
of
the
things
that
counsel
would
just
pretty
well
write
off
in
assessing
the
defense
of
this
kind
of
a
case
when
you
stabbed
44
times,
you
do
not
dwell
with
any
great
length
in
your
client
on
how
we
are
going
to
disprove
the
element
of
intent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
he
was
found
capable
of
standing
trial;
that
decision
was
never
challenge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
that
does
it
mean?
he
did
not
intent
not
only
at
the
first
stab
wound
but
at
the
44th
to
kill
her.
