justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
true
in
flower
too,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
civilians
can
certainly
come
on
the
fort
dix
without
being
stopped
at
a
guard
gate
or
anything
like
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
did
not
he
retained
that
power
and
in
fort
sam,
houston
in
flower
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
not
argue
just
the
opposite
though
that
since
the
shopping
center
is
in
many
respects
private,
it
may
be
able
to
limit
an
invitation
in
a
way
that
the
government
which
is
not
private
in
any
respect
can?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
love
that
case
be
argued
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
army?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
e2
mr.
kairys,
which
side
is
the
base
well
in
--
which
side
is
this
wrightstown?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
near
left
side
is
the
base?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
--
but
those
are
two
different
arguments.
one
is
to
say
that
the
position
really
has
not
been
maintained
at
all
and
it
is
just
kind
of
a
screen
that
the
defense
department
really
does
not
follow
this
position
of
neutrality,
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
the
position
even
if
maintained
is
not
a
legitimate
or
compelling
government
interest
which
would
justify
what
the
army
tried
to
do
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
argument
that
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
to
make
yet,
you
can
agree
with
it
or
disagree
with
it,
but
i
thought
that
was
the
governmentâ€™s
position
that
on
base
military
personnel
in
uniform
are
to
be
divorced
from
active
political
participation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
agree
that
there
is
--
that
that
is
a
legitimate
principle
i
take
it,
if
you
are
just
arguing
about
whether
it
is
applicable
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
their
are
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
one
thing
for
an
individual
perhaps
in
fatigues,
perhaps
in
uniform
to
go
into
the
px,
buy
a
copy
of
newsweek
or
time
and
go
back
to
his
bunk
or
back
to
the
day
room
and
read
what
it
has
to
say
and
quite
another
thing
to
get
an
assemblage
of
two
or
three
thousand
people
in
the
parking
lot
and
have
a
political
address?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
divorce
between
military
in
uniform
and
political?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
their
argument
i
take
it
is
that
their
neutrality
requires
that
the
type
of
active
political
rally
not
be
held
on
the
military
base
and
that
nobody
of
any
party
can
hold
that
kind.
they
usually
--
it
is
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
a
form
of
neutrality.
you
are
saying
that
because
your
man
does
not
have
access
to
the
other
materials
that
come
on
in
quite
a
different
way,
it
is
not
neutrality
but
it
is
really,
but
it
is
just
not
neutrality
that
is
not
completely
fair
to
your
man?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
court
has
always
treated
differently
rallies
and
parades
which
are
subject
to
fairly
rigorous
time,
place
restriction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
state
could
impose
the
same
kind
of
restrictions
on
selling
magazines
on
a
newsstand?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
not
you
have
some
of
the
same
problems
you
had
with
the
hatch
act
if
you
know
your
colonel
is
going
and
your
major
is
going
and
they
are
supporting
this
candidate,
there
is
a
certain
compulsion
on
you
to
show
up
to,
is
not
it,
particularly
if
they
mention
it
to
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
do
not
you
think
if
the
government
can
ban
that
sort
of
compulsion
in
the
hatch
act
for
civil
servants
that
can
follow
this
procedure
here?
