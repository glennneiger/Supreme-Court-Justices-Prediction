take

mr.

who
is
in
the
building,
i
believe
he
is
not
in
the

not
be
necessary

maintain
you
seats
gentlemen
and
we
will

mr.
--
we

74-848
greer
against
spock
next.
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
i
recall
correctly
flowers
put
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
public
street,
in
fact
going
through
that
base
rather
than
the
part
of
the
base.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
barely
meant
that
the
base
there
was
divided
into
two
parts
by
a
public
highway
that
went
through
some
major
portion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
be
it
takes
a
sound
of
order
back
to
the
historical
aspect,
but
is
there
some
history
that
during
the
civil
war
commanders
who
favored
lincoln
gave
special
treatment
to
campaigners
who
came
on
the
bases
and
out
into
army
camps
even
in
the
field
at
the
time
they
were
setting
up
arrangements
for
the
balloting
of
soldiers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
kairys.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
it
is
because
it
looks
like
a
company
town
of
an
older
case,
it
is
a
company
town?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
would
not
satisfy
you
though
if
your
client
were
permitted
to
make
a
speech
out
in
the
streets
subject
to
all
traffic
hazards
of
the
whole
town?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
got
your
response
clear
on
the
parade
matter
that
justice
white
was
inquiring
about.
if
doctor
spock
wanted
to
run
a
parade
down
there
with
torch
lights
and
the
usual
political
parade,
is
it
your
view
that
the
military
commander
could
not
refuse
such
a
parade
permit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
agree
that
the
commander
of
the
base
could
exclude
them
all
for
all
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
let
me
pursue
hypothetical
that
justice
white
was
giving
you,
suppose
we
had
some
city
in
the
country
that
had
problems
such
as
we
had
in
little
rock
about
20
years
ago
and
a
101st
airborne
division
was
ordered
to
stand
ready
to
fly
out
to
that
city
and
see
that
federal
law
was
enforced
and
so
a
senator
from
that
state
asks
the
base
commander
for
permission
to
come
on
the
base
and
explain
to
the
soldiers
why
they
should
not
have
any
part
of
it
or
to
explain
anything
that
he
wants
to
explain.
do
you
think
the
commander
has
got
to
allow
that
senator
to
come
on
the
base?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
us
say
that
the
senator
simply
says
he
wants
to
come
on
the
base
and
discuss
the
problem.
you
do
not
know
what
he
is
going
to
say
after
the
gets
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
--
now
you
are
receding
from
your
suggestion
that
if
this
source
seeds
of
disobedience
that
it
could
be
precluded?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
do?
stop
the
senator
in
the
middle
of
his
speech?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
not
a
prior
restrain,
if
you
stop
him
in
the
middle,
prior
restrain
to
the
second
half
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
already
doing
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
you
do
not
think
that
is
prior
restraint?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
want
to
tap
the
audience,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
not
spread
equally
over
the
55
square
miles
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
that
is
your
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
welcome.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general
we
will
let
you
complete
your
argument
before
we
recess
for
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
difference
would
it
make
if
the
topography
and
the
color
of
the
highway
pavement
and
the
quality
of
the
sidewalks
and
the
kinds
of
houses
were
exactly
the
same
before
you
got
on
the
base
and
after
you
have
got
there?
(voice
overlap)
just
the
difference
that
soldiers
exclusively
occupy
the
base?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
indeed
some
bases
do
have
a
sentry
box
there
and
they
have
a
fence
around
them,
but
i
take
it
from
the
arguments
made
that
the
same
arguments
would
be
advanced
if
there
was
a
ten
foot
wall
and
two
sentries
at
the
gate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-848
greer,
the
commander
of
fort
dix
against
spock
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
