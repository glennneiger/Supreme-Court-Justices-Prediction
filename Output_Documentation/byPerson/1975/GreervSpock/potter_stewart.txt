justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
not
you
concede
that
if
he
does
in
certain
areas
of
the
base
allow
access
to
the
public,
he
has
to
allow
access
to
every
member,
the
public
who
is
not
misbehaving
or
showing
something?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
to
allow
access
to
doctor
spock?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
is
the
way
he
is
put
it
was
not
i
believe
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
different
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
been
addressing
your
self
up
to
now
primarily
to
regulation
210-26
2a,
have
not
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you
did.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you
did
but
it
was
your
purpose
to
separate
the
two
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
--
the
speaker
in
the
case
you
gave
was
the
incumbent
vice
president,
was
not
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
remembers
a
great
many
occasions
when
an
incumbent
president
spoke
only
and
almost
only
at
military
bases
for
the
last
year
so
of
his
incumbency.
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
commander
in
chief
and
i
suppose
he
could
change
any
regulations
that
might
be
made
at
fort
dix
or
anywhere
else,
could
not
he?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
reason
of
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
fort
dix
military
reservation
is
a
united
states
army
post,
located
in
central
new
jersey.
its
primary
mission
is
to
provide
basic
combat
training
for
newly
inducted
army
personnel.
fort
dix
has
a
regulation
that
prohibits
partisan
political
speeches
and
demonstrations
on
the
base.
this
regulation
has
historically
been
rigorously
and
consistently
enforced.
fort
dix
also
has
a
regulation
that
prohibits
the
distribution
of
handbills
on
the
base
without
the
previous
approval
of
the
military
authorities.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
both
of
these
regulations
are
constitutionally
invalid,
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
judgment.
as
to
the
first
regulation,
what
the
record
shows
is
a
considered
fort
dix
policy
objectively
and
evenhandedly
applied
of
keeping
official
military
activities
there
wholly
free
of
entanglement
with
partisan
political
campaigns
of
any
kind.
under
such
a
policy
members
of
the
armed
forces
stationed
at
fort
dix
are
wholly
free
as
individuals
to
attend
political
rallies,
out
of
uniform
and
off
the
base.
but
the
military
as
such
is
insulated
from
both
the
reality
and
the
appearance
of
acting
as
a
handmaiden
for
partisan
political
causes
or
candidates.
this
policy
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
american
constitutional
tradition
of
a
politically
neutral
military
establishment
under
civilian
control.
it
is
a
policy
that
has
been
reflected
in
numerous
laws
and
military
regulations
throughout
our
history.
and
it
is
a
policy
that
the
military
authorities
at
fort
dix
were
constitutionally
free
to
pursue.
as
to
the
second
regulation
regarding
the
distribution
of
handbills,
it
is
possible
of
course
that
this
regulation
might
in
the
future
be
applied
irrationally,
invidiously,
or
arbitrarily,
but
none
of
the
respondents
in
the
present
case
even
submitted
any
material
for
review.
they
were
excluded
from
fort
dix
because
they
had
previously
distributed
literature
there
without
even
attempting
to
obtain
approval
for
the
distribution.
this
case,
therefore,
simply
does
not
raise
any
question
of
unconstitutional
application
of
that
regulation
to
any
specific
situation.
for
the
reasons
i
have
summarized
and
the
additional
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
a
written
opinion
of
the
court,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
joined
and
in
a
part
of
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
illustrated
dissenting
opinion,
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
