mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
that
court
held
that
the
petitioners,
one
of
them
was
the
commander
of
fort
dixon,
new
jersey
is
required
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution,
to
permit
political
campaign
speeches
by
respondents
and
the
distribution
of
literature
in
areas
of
fort
dixon,
that
are
open
to
the
civilian
public.
a
preliminary
injunction
was
entered
in
this
case
requiring
that
of
the
commander.
this
court
refused
to
stay
by
a
vote
of
five
to
four,
i
believe
and
now
a
permanent
injunction
has
been
entered.
respondent
spock
and
hobson
have
been
denied
permission
to
hold
a
political
rally
on
the
base
under
fort
dix
regulation
210-26
which
i
will
describe
in
a
moment
and
the
other
four
respondents
were
barred
from
the
base
for
the
unauthorized
distribution
of
literature
under
fort
dix
regulation
210-27.
the
content
of
the
particular
literatures
is
not
before
us,
is
not
in
the
record,
is
not
an
issue.
our
respondents
were
barred
because
they
refused
to
seek
prior
written
approval.
i
think
it
will
facilitate
discussion
if
i
take
up
the
two
issues
separately
and
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
issue
of
political
speech
and
campaign
rallies
on
a
military
base.
the
regulation
at
this
issue
is
printed
in
page
six
of
our
brief,
it
is
fort
dix
regulation
210-26,
paragraph
2
(a)
and
it
states
simply
that
demonstrations,
picketing,
sit-ins,
protest
marches,
political
speeches
and
similar
activities
are
prohibited
and
will
not
be
conducted
on
the
fort
dixon
military
reservation.
the
only
part
of
that
regulation
which
is
at
issue
here
is
the
part
that
applies
to
and
prohibits
political
speech
--
political
speeches,
not
the
political
speech
in
the
informal
sense
but
a
formal
political
speech.
respondents
i
think
in
their
brief
and
their
argument
and
indeed
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
discussed
that
regulation
as
if
it
were
subject
to
the
same
analysis
as
the
ordinance
of
a
city
council
applying
to
civilians
within
that
city
and
i
have
no
trouble
in
agreeing
if
that
were
the
case,
if
this
were
on
a
special
context,
indeed
the
ordinance,
such
an
ordinance
would
be
unconstitutional
on
first
amendment.
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
military
base
devoted
to
the
training
of
soldiers,
and
it
is
never
been
held
i
think,
or
it
is
never
been
suggested.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
first
amendment
converts
a
military
base
into
a
hyde
park
for
the
convenience
of
those
who
wish
to
make
political
campaign
speeches.
the
fact
that
fort
dix
has
and
it
does
have
some
streets
and
parking
lots,
i
do
not
think
it
makes
a
wide
open
forum
for
a
partisan
political
rallies
and
i
should
note
here
that
the
difference
from
the
civilian
context
is
marked
by
the
fact
and
i
think
it
is
undoubted
that
the
commander
of
fort
dix
has
the
lawful
power
to
exclude
all
civilians
from
the
base.
i
take
that
that
is
true
from
cafeteria
workers
against
mcelroy,
i
take
it
that
is
true
from
18
u.s.c.
1382
and
indeed
i
think
that
to
be
true
because
of
i
think
it
is
conceded
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
true
in
flower
also.
i
think
flower
is
a
different
case
in
a
variety
of
reasons
i
am
going
to
come
to.
one
i
think;
one
reason,
one
point
of
difference
it
seems
to
me
is
that
street
was
indistinguishable
from
any
other
civilian
street
indeed
continued
straight
through
from
the
city
in
the
way
that
is
not
true
at
fort
dix,
but
i
think
there
are
other
reasons
that
the
flower
does
not
govern
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
i
think
that
street
was
indistinguishable
from
the
any
other
public
street
with
shops
and
civilians
are
and
so
forth.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true
and
i
think
the
court
said
that
their
the
military
had
abandoned
control
of
that
street,
i
think
definitely
in
fort
dix
that
is
not
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
can.
now
the
commander
i
think
retains
the
lawful
power
to
change
that
at
any
time.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
i
thought
that
flower
had
announced
that
they
--
if
they
--
principle
so
broad
as
to
say
that
if
the
commander
let
civilians
on
the
base
then
he
must
let
them
on
base
for
all
purposes.
that
is
that
any
access
means
all
access.
then
i
would
without
hesitation
ask
this
court
to
modify
or
reverse
or
overrule
flower.
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
read
that
broadly.
one
reason
i
think
is
that
this
court
thought
that
street
had
been
abandoned.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
abandonment
here
for
reasons
i
will
go
into
and
secondly
10
days
after
flower
in
the
lloyd
corporation
against
tanner
case,
this
court
discussed
the
fact
that
a
shopping
center
which
allowed
civilians
or
shoppers
or
people
enter
freely
nevertheless
did
not
extend
the
full
invitation
for
all
purposes.
now,
i
would
take
it
that
if
a
shopping
center
is
capable
of
limiting
the
scope
of
the
invitation,
so
is
to
exclude
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
leafleting,
then
a
fortiori
a
military
base
has
at
least
the
same
powers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
your
honor,
you
are
referring
to
the
state
action
difference,
i
think
there
may
be
that
difference.
on
the
other
hand
in
logan
valley
plaza,
state
action
was
seen
and
in
that
section
of
lloyd
corporation
against
tanner
which
discusses
the
ability
of
a
shopping
center
to
extend
an
invitation
which
is
limited
in
the
scope,
they
are
not
dealing
with
the
state
action
problem.
so
that
i
think
that
aspect
of
that
opinion
is
fully
applicable
here.
but
in
any
event,
i
take
it
as
a
premise
that
it
is
un-denied
that
the
commander
of
this
base
could
exclude
all
civilians.
i
take
it
also
as
a
premise
that
some
deference
is
due
to
the
judgment
of
the
military
commander,
indeed
that
deference
is
expressed
in
18
u.s.c.
1382
is
to
what
activities
harm
the
function
of
the
military.
the
fact
that
there
are
open
spaces
here
and
streets,
i
think
in
no
way
conforms
this
case
to
cases
involving
the
civilian
context
as
hague
against
cio
speaks
of
the
streets
in
time
and
memorial
being
used
as
places
for
discussion
and
exchange
of
political
ideas
and
it
is
that
tradition
that
use
that
makes
them
a
public
forum
and
some
sense.
in
lehman
against
shaker
heights,
this
court
quoted
the
words
of
lord
dunedin
who
said
and
i
think
it
is
perfectly
applicable
here,
the
truth
is
that
open
spaces
and
public
places
differ
very
much
in
their
character.
and
before
you
can
say
whether
a
certain
thing
can
be
done
on
a
certain
place,
you
have
to
know
the
history
of
the
particular
place.
the
history
of
military
bases
in
this
country
has
been
uniform.
campaign
speeches
have
not
been
given
on
them.
that
has
been
something
that
has
never
been
allowed.
so
far
as
i
know
dr.
spock
is
the
first
candidate
for
a
national
public
office
or
indeed
for
any
public
office
who
has
attempted
to
give
a
political
speech
on
a
base.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
mean
as
opposed
to
a
candidate,
an
issue
speech?
mr.
justice
white
the
regulation
at
fort
dix
i
take
it
would
cover
that
because
it
would
be
a
political
speech,
i
take
it
--
i
am
not
sure
that
they
mean
partisan
political
speech
by
that,
and
it
might
be
an
issue
political
speech
as
well.
but
that
of
course
is
not
what
is
before
us
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
yes
i
am
and
i
would
have
thought
that
that
was
clear
from
the
tradition
of
this
country
in
that
the
law
was
clear
to
that
effect
and
indeed
it
seems
to
me
there
are
only
really
two
arguments
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
respondents
against
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
it
were
discriminatory
you
mean
mr.
justice
white
i
should
have,
no
i
would
not
be
here.
this
is
a
non-discriminatory
regulation
designed
for
very
good
purposes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
author
--
i
might
at
the
outside
authorize
the
filing
of
a
brief
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
court
of
appeals'
argument
rest
upon
two
prepositions
both
of
which
i
think
that
it
demonstrably
falls.
the
first
is
and
i
quote,
“if
the
reservation
is
open
to
all
the
rest
of
the
public,
there
is
no
basis
for
holding
that
it
maybe
closed
selectively
to
political
candidates
or
to
distributors
of
unapproved
literature.”
now,
since
it
conceded
that
the
base
commander
could
seal
a
base
to
all
civilians
that
argument
merely
asserts
that
if
the
commander
allows
any
access
by
civilians
he
is
constitutionally
required
to
allow
all
access.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
he
has
to
allow
access
to
every
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
allow
access
to
doctor
--
doctor
spock
has
complete
access
to
the
base
at
any
base
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
am
talking
about
doctor
spock
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
political
campaign
speech.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
access
for
all
purposes
perhaps
should
be
there.
if
you
allow
access
for
any
purposes
the
court
seems
to
be
saying
he
must
allow
access
for
all
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
bork
now,
that
proposition
i
think
if
it
were
true
it
would
force
every
commander
to
choose
between
sealing
his
base
tight
or
allowing
it
to
become
hyde
park,
a
forum
for
political
discussion
and
indeed
if
that
proposition
were
true,
i
take
at
this
court
would
face
much
the
same
choice
because
this
court
has
limited
access,
political
banners
and
campaign
speeches
may
not
be
made
in
this
building
or
on
this
premises,
although
access
is
allowed
to
the
public.
so
i
take
it
that
if
that
proposition
were
generally
true,
this
court
would
put
in
the
same
choice
of
excluding
the
public
or
allowing
political
speech
at
least
when
it
did
not
interfere
with
a
particular
session
of
the
court.
any
of
those
choices
be
quite
wrong
and
it
be
quite
wrong
i
think
for
reasons
that
parallel
the
reasons
of
forcing
such
a
choice
upon
the
military
would
be
quite
wrong.
and
as
i
have
mentioned
also
the
court
of
appeals'
proposition
that
access
for
any
purposes,
access
were
all
purposes,
seems
to
me
also
to
be
contradicted
by
the
later
opinion
in
lloyd
corporation
against
tanner.
it
is
a
simple
non
sequitur
and
i
think
there
must
be
some
other
policy
reason
one
would
have
to
search
for.
now,
the
only
other
argument
worth
mentioning
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
a
wide
range
of
newspapers
and
magazines
are
permitted
on
the
base
and
the
troops
are
allowed
to
listen
to
radio
and
television
without
restrictions
or
after
the
hours
and
the
court
notes
that
sometimes
minor
party
candidates
do
not
get
as
much
as
media
coverage
and
they
do
not
have
much
money
to
buy
media
coverage
as
more
popular
or
better
known
candidates
do,
and
therefore,
must
make
do
with
face
to
face
campaigning.
now,
the
court
concludes
from
that,
that
the
minor
party
candidate
is
harmed
because
he
needs
to
get
on
the
base,
the
face
to
face
campaigning
all
over
the
rest
of
the
nation
to
engage
in,
whereas
major
party
candidates
are
reported
in
the
new
york
times
or
any
of
the
magazines
or
on
television.
and
the
court
concludes
this
remarkable
analysis
by
referring
to
the
fort
dix
policy
therefore
has
“a
feigned
neutrality
that
serves
no
discernable
military
purpose”
and
i
would
like
to
raise
several
objections
to
that
although
there
are
more
than
several
that
could
be
made.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
raise
the
objection
or
like
to
point
out
that
the
statement
that
there
is
no
discernable
military
policy
is
simply
wrong.
in
fact
there
is
a
crucial
military
policy
and
that
policy
is
the
traditional
safeguard
in
this
nation
of
the
separation
of
the
military
establishment
from
our
political
processes.
it
is
not
a
question
of
will
these
people
passing
out
leaflets
or
making
speeches
interfere
with
the
training
exercise,
of
course
that
can
be
prevented
and
it
is
not
a
question
of
will
political
opinions
reach
the
soldiers,
they
reach
in
all
kinds
of
ways.
soldiers
are
citizens
and
they
get
opinions
through
the
media
from
each
other
from
civilians
outside
in
a
variety
ways.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
well,
if
the
leaflets
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
sense
that
the
mail
is
not
covered.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
you
can
hand
them
out
if
you
get
prior
approval
and
prior
approval
the
regulation
says
will
be
granted.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
not
a
good
objection
to
this
policy
to
say
that
the
military
has
not
expanded
the
policy
to
cover
censorship
of
the
mails.
the
military
has
been
quite
reasonable
about
these
policies
and
it
has
not
attempted
to
censor
or
cut
things
out.
it
has
tried
to
impose
minimal
regulations.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
imagine
it
might
be
mr.
justice
marshall.
but
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
fact
that
they
have
not
tried
to
censor
the
mails
is
not
a
reason
to
object
to
their
attempt
to
make
sure
that
leaflets
are
not
distributed
which
pose
a
clear
danger
as
they
say
to
discipline,
morale
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
they
do
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
could
they?
i
do
not
believe
so.
they
do
have
a
regulation
that
says
if
they
attend
political
--
partisan
political
meetings
off-base
they
should
not,
they
must
not
attended
in
uniform
which
is
--
which
points
out
the
clear
symbolic
line
that
the
military
is
trying
to
draw
between
military
activity
and
political
activity.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
not
--
i
think
the
american
soldier.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
white
and
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
prevent
him
from
hearing
any
ideas.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
might
say
that
the
fact
that
the
military
allows
all
of
these
things
and
it
is
so
wide
open,
it
seems
to
me
not
an
argument
against
that
narrow
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
it
is
simply
this;
it
is
always
been
understood
that
there
is
this
separation
between
the
military
and
the
political
process.
it
is
understood
that
you
are
also
a
citizen,
but
when
you
come
on
the
base,
at
that
point
you
leave
organized
partisan
political
activity
behind
you.
it
is
not
part
of
your
military
life
and
i
think
that
is
largely
a
symbolic
difference,
but
it
is
a
crucial
symbolic
difference.
it
separates
in
the
minds
of
the
soldiers.
he
knows
when
he
is
in
his
unit;
he
is
not
a
political
animal.
he
may
have
his
opinion,
but
right
now
he
is
being
a
military
commander.
that
has
been
a
tradition
to
the
american
politics
and
american
military
life,
throughout
most
of
the
history
of
this
republic
and
i
think
it
is
a
crucial
tradition.
it
is
crucial
for
two
reasons,
it
is
crucial
for
two
--
in
two
aspects.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
i
think
we
are
dealing
and
we
must
in
this
area
with
differences
of
the
degree
which
in
some
point
becomes
so
large
that
they
become
differences
in
kind
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
soldier
listening
to
a
radio,
reading
a
speech,
talking
in
the
barracks,
going
to
a
rally
also.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
let
me
(inaudible).
the
first
three
examples
is
reached
as
in
individual
and
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
rallying
soldiers
on
a
base
where
they
perceive
themselves
as
soldiers
and
subjecting
them
to
political
exhortation.
that
i
think
encourages
a
blurring
of
the
distinction
between
the
military
and
the
civilian
and
regular
political
process
and
that
is
the
distinction
i
think
we
would
be
in
very
bad
shape
if
we
blurred.
of
course
it
requires
drawing
lines.
the
military
here
has
drawn
the
line
as
far
back
as
they
can
and
allowed
as
much
as
they
can
which
i
think
ought
not
to
be
turned
against
them.
i
think
it
is
commendable
if
they
have
drawn
the
line
and
the
regulation
as
narrowly
as
they
have.
if
we
want
to
blur
this
distinction
so
that
troops
are
subjected
to
political
speeches
on
base
gathering
crowds
on
base,
we
then
begin
to
teach
them
that
political
ideas
properly
mixed
with
military
enclaves,
military
functions.
that
seems
to
be
a
very
bad
idea.
it
may
affect
ultimately
their
performance
of
their
military
duties.
it
may
affect
their
attitude
towards
their
superiors
or
towards
their
juniors.
there
will
be
times
in
this
country
again
i
am
sure
of
enormous
unrest
and
great
descent
of
civil
disobedience.
one
thing
we
ought
to
preserve
is
the
idea
that
the
military
does
not
take
part
in
that
as
military,
so
that
we
do
not
get
military
disobedience
in
the
name
of
political
ideas.
the
other
thing
about
that
that
one
ought
to
mention,
we
live
in
quiet
times
now.
but
if
political
speeches
and
campaign
rallies
can
be
held
on
the
base
by
civilians
i
do
not
see
how
troops
can
be
kept
from
holding
their
own
political
rallies
and
campaign
speeches
on
the
base.
there
may
be
times
and
conditions
in
this
country
in
which
they
will
be
a
military
view
point
or
at
least
you
encourage
the
formation
of
a
military
view
point,
if
you
allow
that
kind
of
thing.
and
i
think
that
would
be
very
bad
for
american
politics
if
there
were
a
military
political
view
point.
what
this
regulation
has
designed
to
implement
narrowly
and
carefully
is
a
tradition
that
prevents
a
politicized
military
and
a
tradition
that
prevents
militarized
politics
and
that
is
what
i
think
is
at
stake
here
and
i
think
the
fact
that
so
many
other
sources
of
information
are
open
to
the
troops
is
not
a
reason
to
question
this
policy.
now,
the
statement
that
this
is
a
feigned
neutrality,
i
think
--
i
mean,
i
hope
i
have
shown
that
there
is
a
discernable,
indeed
a
crucial
military
policy
that
is
served
by
these
regulations,
but
i
should
like
to
address
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
been
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
got
drawn
--
i
got
drawn
into
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
to
the
leafleting
as
well.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
at
the
out
set
that
was
the
--
it
was
my
purpose
and
i
have
been
addressing
this,
although
i
think
the
leafleting
regulation
is
close
to
it.
but
i
wanted
to
say
one
of
the
thing
about
the
statement
that
this
is
a
feigned
neutrality.
it
is
a
real
neutrality
and
if
there
is
a
disadvantage
in
getting
media,
proportional
media
coverage
by
these
candidates
financially
disadvantaged
candidates
have
no
greater
first
amendment
rights
than
other
candidates.
the
constitution
does
not
require
the
commander
at
fort
dix
to
make
his
troops
available
as
compensation
for
a
candidate’s
inability
to
buy
ads
or
to
attract
the
new
york
times
or
the
attention
of
nbc.
if
indeed
that
were
the
constitution
which
the
third
circuit
appears
to
think
it
is,
i
would
suppose
that
it
would
be
true
that
the
commander
could
close
his
base
to
all
civilians
except
minor
party
candidates
because
he
would
be
required
to
use
his
base
as
a
reservoir
to
compensate
disadvantaged
candidates.
now,
there
are
more
objections
to
it
but
i
trust
or
i
have
shown
at
least
that
the
policy
is
real
and
that
the
neutrality
is
not
feigned
but
real.
now,
the
leafleting
regulation
is
really
here
on
its
face
in
effect
because
we
have
no
example
of
the
leaflets.
they
have
not
--
not
in
evidence
because
they
were
not
submitted
for
approval,
but
i
should
say
that
the
way
this
operates
is
the
leaflets
are
or
any
matter
would
be
passed
out
as
presented
to
the
base
commander,
he
is
directed
by
the
regulations
that
he
is
to
allow
distribution
unless
he
makes
a
finding,
unless
he
makes
finding
supported
by
evidence
that
he
can
state,
there
would
be
a
clear
danger
to
morale
and
discipline
on
his
base.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
so.
it
would
--
i
believe
so
but
i
--
if
i
am
wrong
i
will
correct
my
self
later.
if
he
makes
such
a
finding,
he
must
forward
it
by
telephonic
communication
to
a
higher
echelon
indeed
to
army
headquarters
so
that
if
they
can
decide
and
impose
a
uniformed
national
policy
on
this.
so
that
we
do
not
have
base
commanders
doing
aberrational
things
and
he
is
specifically
instructed
to
whether
he
likes
the
literature
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
he
is
specifically
instructed
that
it
does
not
matter
for
literature
is
critical
of
u.s.
policies
or
officials
and
it
does
not
matter
even
if
it
is
unfairly
critical.
all
he
may
judge
is
whether
it
poses
a
clear
danger
to
the
discipline
and
good
order
and
morale
of
the
troops.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
indeed
there
--
indeed
there
have
been
violations
of
this
tradition
throughout
our
history
and
i
think
those
were
examples
of
it
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
to
say
that
a
tradition
has
been
violated,
i
do
not
think
means
that
it
is
not
important,
not
crucial
and
not
worth
trying
to
preserve.
indeed
congress,
in
a
number
of
statues
i
think,
cited
at
page
26
of
our
--
well,
it
is
not
26,
but
cited
in
our
brief
has
attempted
to
--
page
36
of
our
brief,
we
list
some
statutes
in
which
congress
has
tried
to
shore
up
this
tradition
and
it
maybe
precisely
because
of
knowledge
that
in
the
past
some
violations
and
breaches
in
that
tradition
have
occurred.
i
was
--
my
attention
was
called
just
yesterday
to
a
letter
by
the
president
lincoln
to
general
hooker
when
he
appoint
him
in
his
command
in
which
he
said
i
am
appointing
you,
there
is
some
things
about
you
i
like
and
some
things
about
you
i
do
not
like,
he
said,
but
you
do
keep
--
he
was
a
very
straight
forward
president
and
he
said,
but
you
do
keep
your
military
duties
and
politics
separate
and
that
i
like.
so
i
think
that
this
has
been
a
tradition
and
a
safeguard
that
we
have
tried
to
insist
upon,
that
has
been
violated
from
time
to
time,
but
i
think
that
is
only
all
the
more
reason
to
try
to
insist
upon
it
now
and
continue
to
insist
upon
it.
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
burger
may
i
please
the
court.
there
is
just
a
few
matters
i
would
like
to
clear
up.
there
has
been
repeated
reference
to
the
army
times
which
appears
in
the
second
part
of
the
exhibit,
plaintiff's
exhibit
on
e3
and
the
censorship
by
the
base
or
something
of
that
sort,
i
think
it
should
be
made
perfectly
clear
that
the
army
times
is
a
civilian
publication;
it
is
not
published
by
the
army.
the
army
has
no
control
over
it.
that
ad
could
appear
in
the
new
york
times
and
come
on
the
base
as
well.
as
to
the
other
points
i
wish
to
touch
upon,
this
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
candidates
cannot
get
at
the
soldiers
because
they
are
confined
to
the
base.
the
truth
is
only
the
trainees
are
confined
to
the
base
for
the
first
four
weeks
of
their
training
which
means
that
there
are
three
weekends
total
denied
to
respondents
in
their
efforts
to
reach
these
gentleman
off
the
base.
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
the
fact
that
coming
on
to
the
base
was
an
attempt
to
appeal
to
soldiers
as
soldiers
and
i
think
that
is
crucial,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
first
volume
of
the
appendix
in
several
places,
but
particularly
at
page
178
where
mr.
hardy
testifies,
the
reason
he
wants
to
get
back
on
to
leaflet,
it
says
there
are
troops
in
both
thailand
and
the
gulf
of
tonkin
which
could
be
easily
reintroduced
into
some
act
of
role
there.
so
anti-war
activity
among
gis
is
still
in
my
opinion
and
in
the
opinion
of
resistance,
an
important
aspect
of
our
work
and
something
we
need
to
continue.
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
leaf
letting
in
this
speech
was
aimed
at
these
people
not
because
they
were
on
enclave
of
citizens.
they
could
not
reach,
but
because
they
were
soldiers
whom
they
wish
to
influence
in
their
attitudes
towards
the
war.
now,
i
suppose
i
should
say
something
about
flower
since
it
has
been
discussed
repeatedly.
the
picture,
e2
which
we
have
been
asked
to
look
at
is
entirely
different
from
the
picture
i
recall
seeing
of
a
new
braunfels
avenue.
you
can
see
an
obvious
line
where
the
town
stops.
there
is
an
ordinary
civilian
community
with
cleaners
and
laundries
and
pizza
houses
and
so
forth
there
and
suddenly
all
of
that
community
activity
stops
and
you
are
clearly
on
a
military
base.
so
it
is
not
indistinguishable
from
the
community.
it
is
--
there
is
a
clear
line.
here
mr.
kairys
says
quite
correctly
that
there
was
no
abandonment
in
this
case.
military
jurisdiction
over
even
traffic
violations
is
complete
and
any
case
goes
to
u.s.
magistrate
not
necessary
to
u.s.
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
it
will
make
any
difference
mr.
chief
justice
because
all
of
the
policy
reasons
would
apply
and
that
is
why
i
do
not
believe
in
this
expanded
reading
regarding
of
the
flower
case
because
if
that
is
what
flower
really
meant
then
it
really
is
a
trivial
point.
i
cannot
believe
that
it
is.
it
becomes
a
trivial
point
in
that
all
the
military
need
to
spend
the
additional
money
to
put
a
sentry
at
the
post
and
say
show
me
your
pass
or
get
a
pass.
what
that
has
to
do
with
political
campaign
rallies
on
the
base,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
see
the
nexus
between
spending
the
money
to
close
the
base
in
that
sense
and
the
first
amendment
question
and
the
separation
of
military
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
take
it
so,
because
if
the
point
is
that
the
base
commander
much
used
his
troops
to
compensate
doctor
spock
or
other
minor
party
candidates
whose
inability
to
get
a
good
a
news
rating
then
i
think
it
would
not
matter
whether
there
is
a
wall
or
whether
the
base
is
open
and
i
would
point
once
more
to
lloyd
corporation
against
tanner
and
indeed
the
grayned
against
the
city
of
rockford
which
said
that
even
a
public
sidewalk
could
be
denied
for
use
for
some
purposes
because
of
the
interest
in
running
schools.
i
think
the
interest
here
in
the
separation
of
the
military
and
the
political
is
clearly
of
that
caliber
and
furthermore
it
is
not
a
public
sidewalk,
it
is
military
base
which
by
tradition
in
this
country
has
been
closed
to
this
kind
of
activity.
