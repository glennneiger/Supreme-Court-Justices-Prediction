i
suppose
mr.
kairys
there
is
one
distinction
between
flowers
in
this
case,
that
one
was
not
plenary
argument.
it
was
a
summary
disposal,
was
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
you
just
said
there
was
not
any
difference
between
flower
case
and
this
one
and
you
are
already
saying
that
(voice
overlap)
that
distinction
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
automobile
that
is
turning
right
i
need
to
–
is
that
–
is
the
highway
at
that
point
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
in
the
base
or
is
that
a
state
highway?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
is
my
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
other
words
there
are
state
roads
that
go
through
the
base
which
are
not
under
the
control
of
the
military
that
was
(voice
overlap).
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
remember
it,
that
has
been
open
to
the
base
many
times.
there
are
countless
streets
like
that,
are
it
not?
