lest
to
have
a
problem,
a
little
problem
which
is
one
point.
you
could
mail
these
leaflets
and
that
is
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
were
mailed
there
is
no
restriction
against
that,
if
they
were
mailed
it
each
soldier
on
the
base?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
cannot
--
but
you
can
hand
them
out.
now
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
not
get
prior
approval
of
the
mailing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
do,
i
imagine
that
would
be
litigated
in
it
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whose
jurisdiction
of
the
roads
on
the
traffic
violations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
military
has
at
least
the
mentality?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
state
thing
is
they
have
state
signs
and
that
is
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
the
state
has.
justice
thurgood
marshall

you
help
me
with
one
point
--
this
is
not
the
general
army
regulation,
this
is
a
regulation
of
fort
dix
you
are
talking
about,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
where
does
quonset
come
in
to
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
an
unimportant
fact
and
it
was
not
correct.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
in
this
case,
you
can
mail
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can
mail
this
leaflet?
justice
thurgood
marshall

can
mail
all
the
leaflets?

are
arguing
equal
protection
there?
