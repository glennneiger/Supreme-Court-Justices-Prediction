justice

what
about
a
–
say
a
charter
against
a
city
or
some
initiative
or
referendum
matter,
a
speech
in
support
or
an
opposition
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
think
you
are
positing
--
but
you
are
justifying
the
regulation
on
the
grounds
that
particular
kinds
of
speech
just
do
not
fit
in
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
i
suppose,
that
you
--
but
you
are
saying
the
regulation
forbids
all
political
speech,
which
is
not
sovereign?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
not
be
here
i
suppose
if
it
just
to
prohibit
at
some
kinds
of
political
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
base
forbids
soldier
stationed
there
from
attending
political
meetings
off
the
base?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
well
could
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
is
not
the
–
is
not
the
–
it
is
the
way
--
their
worry
is
how
the
military
would
look
to
the
public
rather
than
any
danger
to
the
soldier?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
do
not
let
him
go
off
to
the
base
and
attend
any
political
meeting
he
wants
to
attend?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
listen
the
the
radio
all
he
wants
to
and
read
all
the
magazines
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
then
--
what
is
the
reason
then
for
the
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
said
while
they
are
sitting
there
on
the
base
and
they
are
free
to
listen
to
political
speeches
on
the
radio
or
on
television
and
sit
around
in
their
uniforms
and
read
the
magazines,
read
speeches?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
wanted
to
have
--
uphold
a
parade
on
one
of
those
state
streets
--
state
roads?
whom
do
you
the
ask
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
along
the
state
–
it
is
a
state
highway
though
–
state
58
where
it
goes
through
the
base?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
--
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
wants
to
use
that
easement
for
a
parade?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
state
has
that
is
subject
to
military
requirements?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
the
highway
right
away
is
a
--
is
beyond
parking
lines
or
the
sides
walk
on
part
of
the
right
a
way
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
just
like
a
--
but
it
could
be
or
in
some
cities
the
part
of
the
curb
areas
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
coming
on
the
base
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
speech
that
attacks
military
policy
and
is
aimed
at
urging
soldiers
not
to
fight
in
a
particular
battle
or
particular
war?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
am
talking
about
whether
that
is
the
kind
of
a
speech
that
commander
could
exclude
from
the
base?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
asked
you,
i
asked
you
whether
he
could
exclude
that
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
well
that
the
united
states'
position
is
that
you
ought
to
also
be
able
to
exclude
political
speech
generally
because
political
speech
is
inconsistent,
that
kind
of
political
activity
is
inconsistent
with
the
military
posture?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
--
they
say
--
but
they
just
say
political
speech
generally?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
neutral
--
that
neutral
as
to
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
really
want
to
do
is
reach
the
soldiers
i
take
it
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
coming
on
the
base
at
least
you
really
are
saying
we
want
to
come
in
and
appeal
the
soldiers
as
soldiers?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
that
is
one
thing
that
the
other
candidates
that
have
access
to
the
media
are
not
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
are
making
the
general
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
talking
about
the
press
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
talking
about
the
press
and
i
suppose
that
your
candidate
can
buy
an
ad
in
the
papers
that
are
distributed
on
the
post.
you
cannot
say
that
--
that
--
you
cannot
say
you
cannot
afford
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
talking
about
the
poor
candidate
is
not
being
able
use
the
media
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
buy
it
in
newspapers
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
you
can
mail
all
the
leaflets.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
--
you
have
not
met
the
government
on
its
own
ground
yet.
you
talk
this
discrimination
and
non-neutrality,
but
you
have
not
really
faced
up
to
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
of
substance
to
the
government’s
position
if
there
is
some
consistency
between
overt
political
activity
in
uniform
on
a
base
and
being
a
soldier?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
--
i
suppose
you
would
--
would
you
say
that
you
had
a
case
on
with
respect
to
this
fort
if
adjacent
to
the
military
property
there
was
a
stadium
that
was
at
free
of
charge
you
can
hold
meetings
in,
based
on
private
property
and
any
military
man
was
completely
free
to
come
to
that
if
he
wanted
to
as
long
as
--
and
he
--
