mr.
david
kairys
mr.
chief
justice
burger
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
with
a
few
facts
about
the
base,
particularly
regarding
the
questions
that
were
asked
by
the
court
of
solicitor
general.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
note
anyway
in
which
the
solicitor
general
actually
distinguishes
this
base
or
these
areas
that
first
amendment
rights
were
granted
in
this
case
from
either
the
areas
at
fort
sam
houston
involved
in
the
flower
or
from
the
usual
kinds
of
civilian
streets.
they
say
that
it
is
distinguishable
and
i
still
do
not
see
the
specific
way
that
they
distinguish
it.
regarding
the
question
of
mr.
chief
justice
burger
burger,
there
are
also
highways,
state
roads
and
county
roads
that
go
completely
across
the
base
and
the
one
involving
several
the
respondents
here
in
the
wrightstown
road
exit
which
is
pictured
in
appendix,
volume
2
at
page
e2
is
certainly
indistinguishable
from
the
city.
you
cannot
even
figure
out
on
that
picture
where
base
starts
and
where
the
city
ends.
it
seems
to
me
i
have
never
seen
fort
sam
houston,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
picture
of
what
this
court
seem
to
describe
in
that
case.
mr.
david
kairys
no,
i
am
saying
that
the
base
is
--
the
road
goes
right
through
the
city
and
right
through
the
base
exactly
as
in
flower
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
indistinguishable
from
a
city
street.
mr.
david
kairys
no.
i
am
referring
to
the
sidewalk
on
that
street.
mr.
david
kairys
the
photographer
is
on
the
base
and
the
wrightstown
is
in
beyond
--
do
you
see
the
railroad
crossing,
the
crossed
white
fence
at
the
top
of
a
post
where
the
railroad
comes,
right
next
to
that
there
is
two
small
mounds,
this
is
in
the
testimony
regarding
this
picture,
there
is
two
small
mounds
on
either
side
of
the
street
that
indicate
that
you
are
entering
the
base.
mr.
david
kairys
the
home,
the
street
where
that
railroad
crossing
is,
beyond
that
railroad
crossing
is
wrightstown,
new
jersey
in
the
background
of
the
picture
towards
the
photographer
closer
to
the
picture
is
the
base
from
then
and
then
--
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
in
wrightstown.
mr.
david
kairys
the
two
cleaners
are
in
wrightstown,
they
are
just
before
the
entrance
to
the
base.
it
is
a
really
matter
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
of
about
five
feet
from
the
commercial
district
of
wrightstown
to
the
beginning
of
the
base.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
all
wrightstown,
yes
sir.
the
two
civilians
on
the
base,
on
this
side,
the
photographer
side
of
the
railroad
crossing
are
respondents
ginaven
and
misch
actually
handing
leaflets
to
two
soldiers
just
prior
to
their
arrest.
this
was
taken
actually
just
prior
to
their
actual
arrest.
mr.
david
kairys
oh!
yes,
procedurally,
yes.
are
you
referring
some
distinction
between
the
particular
area
the
base
involved
there
and
the
one
here?
mr.
david
kairys
yes
sir,
i
was
limiting
myself,
i
am
sorry,
i
should
have
been
clear.
i
was
limiting
myself
to
the
description
of
the
actual
areas
involved
that
they
are
the
same
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
base
was
abandoned
in
any
kind
of
sense
of
abandoning
control
was
the
solicitor
general
says
in
flower.
it
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
flower
was
arrested,
their
twice
by
military
authorities
that
indeed
the
military
exercised
control
over
that
area.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
a
civilian
vehicle
--
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
on
the
base,
but
it
is
a
state
road
that
goes
right
through
the
base.
mr.
david
kairys
yes
sir.
mr.
david
kairys
absolutely,
the
state
retained
easements
over
those
roads
when
the
land
was
ceded
to
the
military.
mr.
david
kairys
there
are.
the
colonel
also
and
the
provost
marshal
testified
that
there
were
ten
such
an
entrances
similar
to
this
that
are
wholly
open
to
the
public
merely
marked
that
you
are
entering
the
base.
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
exhibit
e4,
that
is
taken
on
new
jersey
route
68
which
is
another
state
road
that
goes
entirely
cross
the
base
and
it
marks
the
base
as
it
does
at
the
other
one
and
there
is
a
sign
on
the
gate
there
that
says
“visitors
welcome”.
mr.
david
kairys
they
are
patrolled
by
the
military.
mr.
david
kairys
no.
mr.
david
kairys
within
the
base?
you
are
referring
to
the
--
mr.
david
kairys
you
would
have
to
ask
the
military
authorities.
mr.
david
kairys
the
only
thing
that
state
has
is
an
easement
across
the
base.
mr.
david
kairys
well
i
know
if
it
is
ever
happened,
but
the
military
proclaims
its
control
over
those
roads
entirely
and
it
does
close
them,
for
instance
if
there
is
a
demonstration
or
other
activity
at
mcguire
air
force
base
which
is
down
the
road,
the
military
will
entirely
close
new
jersey
route
68.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
kairys
then
the
states
seems
to
exceed
to
that.
mr.
david
kairys
as
i
understand
the
military
does.
mr.
david
kairys
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
the
jurisdiction
ends
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
base
on
any
of
the
roads.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct.
they
are
definitely
patrolled
by
the
military
in
any
traffic
violations
or
process
by
the
military.
mr.
david
kairys
courts?
mr.
david
kairys
no
sir.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
kairys
you
mean
numbers
on
the
road?
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct
and
the
state
has
ceded
all
other
authority
over
to
the
military
regarding
this
roads.
and
the
military
--
mr.
david
kairys
i
do
not
know.
but
the
military
exercises
effective
control
over
the
sidewalks
--
mr.
david
kairys
it
is
possible.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
david
kairys
if
you
get
it
from
the
military.
mr.
david
kairys
yes,
i
believe
they
will
take
you
to
a
magistrate
if
it
is
anything
serious.
yes.
in
any
violations
of
law
they
report
to
the
u.s.
attorney
in
that
area.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
it
seems
to
me
that,
first
of
all
parades
were
not
included
or
no
demonstrations
in
this
particular
case,
but
they
are
protected
forms
of
speech.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
have
to
undergo
the
same
kind
of
analysis
that
we
have
urged
the
court
to
take
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
government
interest
involved
under
the
test
that
this
court
has
prescribed
over
and
over
again
and
see
if
that
is
an
important
or
substantial
interest
to
see
if
it
is
unrelated
to
suppression
of
speech
and
if
the
restrictions
of
speech
are
no
greater
than
our
essential
to
further
into
that
interest
and
if
not
then
the
first
amendment
rights
should
be
allowed,
i
believe.
i
think
that
is
what
the
solicitor
general
fails
to
do
in
this
case
at
all
is
to
subject
this
base
to
that
kind
of
analysis,
rather
than
go
through
the
analysis
and
point
to
some
specific
military
interest,
any
kind
of
concrete
interest.
what
the
government
has
done
essentially
is
to
create
a
kind
of
false
dichotomy
that
has
a
little
bit
emotional
appeal,
they
say
it
is
a
question
of
a
military
base
rather
than
street
sidewalks
and
parks.
well,
these
are
streets,
sidewalks
and
parks
and
they
are
open
to
the
public.
people
can
go
on
there
for
reason
they
please
or
for
no
reason
at
all.
there
is
no
limit
on
that.
mr.
david
kairys
i
do,
certainly.
but
i
think
implicit
in
the
difference,
say
between
a
decision
in
hague
v.
cio
and
the
decision
in
davis
v.
massachusetts
is
that
power
to
exclude
all
does
not
necessarily
include
the
lesser
power
to
exclude
some
or
to
exclude
based
on
content.
i
mean,
that
is
essentially,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
solicitor
general
is
saying
is
that
we
go
back
to
davis
v.
massachusetts
where
the
only
question
is
property
rights
and
if
you
have
--
since
you
have
the
right
to
totally
exclude
someone
from
your
property,
you
also
have
the
lesser
right
to
partially
exclude,
to
selectively
exclude
or
to
exclude
certain
purposes.
it
seems
to
me
that
was
overruled
in
hague
and
since
then
once
something
is
open
to
the
public,
people
are
allowed
to
come
on
and
talk
for
any
reason.
the
provost
marshal
testify
that
the
sight
of
a
civilian
talking
to
a
few
soldiers
in
front
of
the
px
or
in
front
of
the
cafeteria
were
so
common
and
that
it
would
not
even
be
noticed.
there
is
no
question
of
them
going
up
and
checking
and
asking
what
that
person
is
saying
at
all?
mr.
david
kairys
well,
you
termed
that
whether
that
could
be
punished
afterward?
mr.
david
kairys
i
think
--
well,
i
do
not
think
under
the
guise
of
that
danger
he
could
exclude
all
speeches
and
that
is
really
the
question?
mr.
david
kairys
yes.
mr.
david
kairys
but
they
offered
no
evidence
or
argument
about
these
particular
speakers.
the
content
of
what
they
are
going
to
say
at
the
fort
--
mr.
david
kairys
well,
the
then
that
gets
--
it
gets
to
the
neutrality
point
which
i
think
is
a
separate
point.
i
think
what
they
are
saying
is
that
the
only
kind
of
favoritism
that
makes
any
difference
to
the
solicitor
general
is
favoritism
as
to
who
speaks
person
to
person,
that
one
form
of
speech.
they
want
to
eliminate
favoritism
as
to
one
form
of
speech.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
really
the
relevant
concern.
when
you
have
partisan
--
mr.
david
kairys
excuse
me.
mr.
david
kairys
as
to
that
one
form
of
speech,
they
are
neutral.
they
are
wrong
when
they
say
doctor
spock
is
the
first
one
that
gave
a
political
speech,
the
first
one
was
former
vice
president
agnew
who
gave
a
speech
in
--
at
quonset
naval
base
in
rhode
island.
permission
to
give
that
speech
was
granted
three
days
after
they
had
made
an
argument,
the
military
had
made
an
argument
based
on
neutrality,
the
exact
icon
that
they
make
here
in
which
they
opposed
in
court,
they
made
this
argument
opposing
also
doctor
spock
in
the
same
respondents
in
this
case
who
sought
access
to
that
same
base.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct
and
he
gave
a
political
speech
--
mr.
david
kairys
yes.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct.
i
think
this
sort
of
neutrality
that
obviously
does
not
really
mean
much
to
the
department
of
defense.
it
is
three
days
after
they
argued
in
court,
they
could
grant
permission
for
a
political
candidate
to
make
a
political
speech.
it
obviously
does
not
mean
anything
to
them.
mr.
david
kairys
we
are
saying
both.
i
am
saying
even
if
putting
aside
what
they
did
at
quonset
naval
base,
that
they
are
trying
to
maintain
a
kind
of
neutrality
around
one
form
of
speech.
they
are
saying
that
as
to
face
to
face
speech,
we
are
going
to
be
totally
neutral.
of
course
it
is
a
pretty
expensive
brand
of
neutrality
because
it
means
that
the
only
candidates
who
can
get
information
to
the
voters
and
there
is
22,000
voters
at
fort
dix,
the
only
candidates
who
could
do
that
are
the
ones
who
can
afford
to
hire
the
mass
media
to
get
their
message
across.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
kairys
i
was
just
responding
to
the
statement
made
by
the
solicitor
general
that
doctor
spock
was
the
first
candidate
ever
to
do
a
campaign
speech
on
a
base,
that
is
all.
mr.
david
kairys
it
is
just
factually,
it
was
not
correct
that
former
vice
president
agnew
had
been
the
first
one.
mr.
david
kairys
okay.
mr.
david
kairys
yes!
mr.
david
kairys
well,
certainly
if
it
gets
to
the
point
of
urging
insubordination,
failure
to
follow
orders,
yes.
i
think
that
would
also
--
that
could
involve
protected
speech
and
the
circumstances
of
any
such
case,
all
of
the
circumstances
would
have
to
be
included
in
the
same
analysis.
mr.
david
kairys
i
would
apply
myself
a
clear
and
present
danger
standard
to
statements
like
that
by
a
civilian,
certainly
by
a
civilian
candidate
for
president
and
if
there
were
no
clear
and
present
danger
of
unlawful
activities
or
of
violence
or
something
like
that
then
i
would
say
it
is
protected.
mr.
david
kairys
if
he
gets
to
the
point
of
urging
disobedience
of
orders
then
i
think
it
is
no
longer
protected.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
i
think
--
i
think
soldiers
like
other
citizens
should
have
all
first
amendments
rights
that
they
can
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
their
status
as
soldier.
this
court
has
said
that
as
to
prisoners
and
that
if
there
is
a
political
controversy
going
on
in
the
country
or
in
a
particular
area
about
an
issue
that
people
should
be
able
to
talk
to
them
and
if
they
should
be
able
receive
that
information
--
mr.
david
kairys
i
am
saying
if
you
urge
insubordination,
i
could
see
situations
where
if
you
urge
violation
of
orders
that
that
could
--
that
that
is
no
longer
protected.
mr.
david
kairys
yes,
that
is
--
i
thought
--
there
is
tradition
in
the
history,
if
they
mean
anything
is
that
that
is
what
you
do
that
you
do
not
impose
a
prior
restrain
on
speech.
mr.
david
kairys
i
thought
you
meant
by
the
middle
(voice
overlap)
he
was
already
doing
it.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
at
the
point
he
already
does
it
then
you
stop
him.
mr.
david
kairys
no,
if
he
is
already
committed
a
crime,
no.
mr.
david
kairys
yes.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
effectively
banning
the
time
when
any
candidate
could
come
out,
well
i
think
it
--
mr.
david
kairys
i
would
subject
that
to
the
same
analysis
if
there
is
no
substantial
--
mr.
david
kairys
i
understand.
well,
if
there
is
no
substantial
concrete
military
interest
in
this
unrelated
to
suppression
of
freedom
of
expression
which
and
i
think
this
would
have
a
presumption
that
is
related
to
some
--
to
me
it
would,
that
is
related
to
suppression
of
expression
and
if
there
is
no
such
interest
then
it
would
not
be
valid.
i
would
subject
it
to
the
repeated
analysis
that
this
court
has
handed
down.
i
think
it
is
important
in
considering
all
the
claims
of
the
military
in
this
case
that
they
have
not
really
pointed
to
any
specific
interest
and
it
is
pretty
evident
from
one
quote,
a
very
brief
quote
from
their
brief
that
i
just
like
to
read,
this
is
at
page
39.
we
do
not
in
anyway
deprecate
the
value
of
freedom
of
speech
by
observing
that
certain
candidates
might
express
fuse
that
could
undermine
the
morale,
obedience
and
discipline
of
members
of
the
military
and
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
mights
and
coulds
and
the
whole
thing
is
framed
as
an
observation.
mr.
david
kairys
the
question
of
whether
they
could
come
to
one
of
these
rallies
which
first
of
all
are
held
on
off
duty
times,
the
rally
in
this
case
was
held
on
a
saturday,
an
off-duty
time,
the
question
of
whether
they
can
come
in
uniform
or
not
which
i
would
probably
agree
with
them
on
is
a
separate
question.
mr.
david
kairys
i
wholly
agree
with
neutrality
of
the
military
as
a
principle.
i
think
that
is
extremely
important,
but
i
do
not
think
they
are
neutral
when
they
allow
one
branch,
one
group
of
candidates,
the
major
party
candidates
to
have
this
total
barrage
of
access
with
one
form
of
speech,
the
mass
media
and
then
deny
something
which
i
believe
that
all
civilians
are
entitled
to
on
the
base
since
it
is
opened
and
there
is
no
contravening
military
interest.
they
denied
the
right
to
face
to
face
speech.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
first
of
all
colonel
olsen
indicated
that
he
saw
no
problem
with
people
talking
about
the
campaign.
it
happened
all
the
time.
and
further
--
i
mean
they
stand
around
and
they
do
talk
about
the
campaign,
groups
of
soldiers.
they
also
allow
events
that
have
5,000
civilians.
they
allow
a
rock
concert
out
on
a
ball
field
with
5,000
people
--
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct,
but
it
certainly
indicates
that
you
cannot
say
as
the
court
of
appeals
says
you
cannot
really
find
per
se
the
possibility
of
disruption
and
then
i
think
that
is
a
separated
issue,
but
the
neutrality
issue
it
seems
to
me
is
a
feigned
neutrality
as
the
court
of
appeals
said.
they
are
maintaining
a
neutrality
as
to
one
form
of
speech
when
the
real
question
in
terms
of
neutrality
is
overall
neutrality.
i
mean
how
can
they
seriously
say
that
the
military
is
being
neutral
at
fort
dix
when
this
ad
at
page
e3
of
appendix
2,
this
ad
urging
the
re-election
of
president
nixon
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
this
case
was
in
army
times,
the
most
predominant
newspaper
on
the
base.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
not
neutrality.
mr.
david
kairys
no,
irregardless
of
whether
they
could
afford
it
or
not,
it
is
simply
is
not
neutrality.
neutrality
to
me
should
refer
to
all
forms
of
speech.
if
you
are
going
to
let
one
group
candidates
get
exposure,
to
me
exposure
is
the
issue.
if
one
group
can
get
exposure
on
the
base
by
one
form,
then
you
are
no
longer
neutral.
neutrality
is
out
of
the
question
and
the
question
becomes,
is
it
appropriate
or
is
there
any
reason
why
should
not
allow
other
candidates
to
use
this
other
form.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
right.
mr.
david
kairys
no,
i
am
not
asking
that.
i
am
saying
that
if
civilians
generally
have
the
right
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights
on
the
base
which
i
believe
they
do
because
the
base
is
open
and
because
there
is
no
specific
concrete
military
interest
that
competes
with
it.
these
are
open
areas,
street,
sidewalks
and
parks.
there
is
no
nearby
courthouse,
there
is
no
nearby
jail
or
anything
like
that.
that
once
civilians
generally
have
the
right
to
exercise
that
right
and
once
you
allow
other
parties,
the
majority
parties
to
come
on
in
some
form
to
get
exposure,
there
is
no
reason
not
to
allow
these
candidates
to
exercise
that
face
to
face
right.
and
no
reason
based
in
neutrality
or
disruption
or
anything
else.
i
think
if
i
can
get
back
just
to
the
--
briefly
to
the
--
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
kairys
they
do.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
if
you
read
--
mr.
david
kairys
well,
if
you
read
president
nixon’s
ad
i
think
it
is
pretty
well
pitched
towards
soldiers.
if
you
read
this
ad,
page
e3,
appendix
2.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
co
--
well,
i
am
saying
that
they
use
--
mr.
david
kairys
they
cannot
buy
an
ad
in
army
times.
that
is
censors
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
kairys
yes,
they
can
buy
an
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
that
is
an
ex
--
there
is
22,000
soldiers.
mr.
david
kairys
yes
we
do.
the
question
is
even
if
you
have
some
alternative
that
i
believe
is
not
sufficiently
affected,
but
even
of
you
have
some
alternative
what
is
the
government
interest?
it
seems
to
me
the
burden
should
be
there,
what
is
the
government
interest
in
not
allowing
them
do
the
face
to
face
speech?
mr.
david
kairys
i
think
the
uniform
issue
is
a
separate
issue.
if
they
want
to
prohibit
any
military
personnel
from
viewing
any
political
event
in
uniform
as
they
have
done
then
there
is
a
question
that
there
could
be
a
question.
i
do
not
think
there
is
to
whether
that
is
valid
or
not,
but
that
is
a
separate
issue
is
to
whether
they
could
come
on
and
if
they
stand
there
and
they
read
that
ad
in
uniform,
i
mean,
any
one
can
can
on
newspaper
say,
that
army
times
which
is
sanctioned
by
the
post
and
is
censored
by
the
post
authorities,
a
proven
ad
like
that
--
mr.
david
kairys
but
they
are
not.
most
of
them
were
restricted
to
the
base.
that
is
in
the
testimony
of
the
provost
marshal.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
they
are
hardly
captive,
it
is
55
square
miles.
i
mean
they
can
choose
to
come
to
the
rally
or
not.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
this
area
that
this
rally
was
held
was
on
a
parking
lot
adjacent
to
it
a
movie
theater.
there
are
six
different
movie
theaters
on
the
base.
it
was
one
of
six
movie
theaters.
it
was
called
theater
five.
now,
there
is
certainly
no
aspect
of
a
captive
audience,
this
is
an
outside
area,
it
is
literally
55
square
miles
and
no
one
had
to
attend
this.
mr.
david
kairys
i
do
not
see
that
that
--
no.
i
do
not
any
more
than
there
is
a
compulsion
say
to
back
president
nixon.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
i
do
not
consider
going
to
a
rally
and
hearing
someone
speak
participation
and
even
the
military’s
own
regulation
itself
says
that
common
sense
shall
apply
to
that
regulation.
i
do
not
consider
that
participation.
i
would
just
like
to
come
back
to
that
quote
briefly
if
i
can.
is
my
time
up?
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
my
five
minutes,
okay.
mr.
david
kairys
i
think
the
case
hinges
in
addition
to
this
neutrality
question
on
whether
civilians
generally
have
the
right
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights
on
these
portions
to
the
base
and
that
again
i
would
subject
to
the
court’s
usual
analysis
and
an
observation
that
views
might
be
expressed
that
could
undermine,
it
is
hardly
sufficient
as
a
military
--
as
a
government
interest
to
override
interest
in
freedom
of
speech.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
allows
that
kind
of
observation
to
be
held
sufficient
to
impose
a
prior
restraint,
that
is
a
serious
problem
and
they
have
done
exactly
within
the
quote,
they
said
they
did
not
want
to
do
it,
they
deprecated
the
value
of
freedom
of
speech.
i
just
like
to
briefly
address
then
the
second
issue
concerning
the
prior
restraint
on
leaflets.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
court
agrees
that
civilians
do
have
the
right
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights
on
these
areas
because
they
are
essentially
public
street,
sidewalks
and
parks
and
because
there
is
no
military
interest
to
do
otherwise,
then
the
carl
area
right
of
being
free
of
a
prior
restraint
as
to
content,
it
seems
to
me
would
follow
and
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
actually
concede
that.
so
if
the
court
accepts
that
analysis
it
seems
that
there
is
no
problem
as
to
the
second
point.
thank
you.
mr.
david
kairys
well,
it
defines
them
as
in
a
negative
way,
it
defines
them
as
any
area
not
marked
restricted
and
they
are
prominently
marked
and
then
there
is
testimony
that
does
define
them.
the
barracks
are
restricted
and
so
no
one
went
near
them
and
we
accepted
their
definition
of
restrict,
we
never
challenge
anything
they
said
in
that
regard
and
we
never
sought
to
go
inside
of
any
building.
mr.
david
kairys
that
is
correct.
the
barracks
were
though.
mr.
david
kairys
the
residential
areas
--
at
least
the
way
i
consider
them
are
where
--
there
is
a
whole
row
of
houses,
almost
like
a
settlement
where
families
live.
the
barracks
are
where
the
troops
are
billeted
in.
mr.
david
kairys
and
probably
the
officers.
mr.
david
kairys
that
was
limited
as
the
result
of
a
--
the
order
as
to
the
specific
rally
limited
the
areas
in
a
more
defined
way
and
it
is
said
where
leaf
letters
could
go
and
where
they
could
not
and
that
is
exactly
where
the
rally
would
be
and
that
was
arrived
at
by
negotiation
between
counsel.
thank
you.
