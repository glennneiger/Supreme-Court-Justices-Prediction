mr.
joel
m.
gora
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
to
the
disclosure
provisions
of
the
challenged
legislation
and
in
that
argument,
i
occupy
i
think
a
unique
role
in
this
preceding
in
that,
these
are
provisions
that
we
do
not
challenge
as
inherently
are
invalid.
in
fact,
we
think
as
professor
winter
indicated
that
disclosure
provisions
properly
and
carefully
drawn
to
focus
on
the
problems
that
generated
this
legislation,
provide
the
proper
solution.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
they
do,
but
unfortunately,
justice
brennan
they
do
much
more
than
that.
by
virtue
of
their
sweep
in
terms
of
the
coverage
and
in
terms
of
the
depth
of
reporting,
they
go
well
beyond
in
our
submission,
the
valid
area
of
regulation
supported
by
governmental
interests.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
yes
sir,
i
do
mr.
chief
justice,
both
of
the
amounts
in
terms
of
the
threshold
of
reporting
and
the
scope
in
terms
of
who
is
covered.
this
statute
requires
that
all
political
committees
must
keep
a
detailed
and
exact
account
of
the
identification
that
is
a
statutory
term,
it
means
name
and
residence
address,
the
identification
of
each
person
who
contributes
in
excess
of
$10.00
a
year.
that
is
a
virtual
monitoring
of
everyone
who
makes
a
political
contribution
in
the
united
states.
similarly,
all
candidates
and
political
committees,
whether
they
be
the
committee
to
re-elect
the
president
or
a
local
small
minority
party
in
california,
all
political
committees
for
all
offices
have
to
file
reports,
disclosing
the
identity
of
their
contributors
in
excess
of
$100.00
a
year.
and
finally,
any
citizen
who
on
his
own
spends
more
than
$100.00
a
year
on
federal
politics,
independent
of
any
candidate,
just
goes
and
prints
out
some
leaflets
attacking
his
local
member
of
congress,
must
register
and
file
reports
with
this
commission,
indicating
the
source
and
nature
of
his
expenditures.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
the
penalty
for
non-compliance
with
the
disclosure
reporting
requirements
is
i
believe
a
1-year
in
jail
and
i
believe
it
is
a
thousand
dollars
fine.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
a
hundred
dollar
independent
expenditure
contribution.
if
i
for
example,
run
an
ad
in
the
village
voice
in
new
york
or
some
comparable
paper,
spend
$125.00
on
it
saying
defeat
so
and
so,
vote
for
so
and
so,
i
have
to
file
a
detailed
report
with
the
commission,
giving
the
source
of
my
money,
how
it
was
spent
and
so
forth.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
striking
independent
--
the
disclosure
requirements
independent
speech
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
yes,
i
think
we
would.
i
think
if
this
court
were
to
indicate
that
the
statute
reached
too
deeply
in
terms
of
the
threshold
and
swept
too
widely
in
terms
of
the
reach,
yes,
we
would
be
--
that
is
our
position,
that
it
is
not
properly
focused
to
those
interests
that
the
government
can
properly
require
disclosure
for.
the
problem
is
that
the
government
interests
and
associational
privacy
have
run
up
against
each
other
in
this
area.
depending
on
where
congress
draws
the
line,
will
determine
for
example
for
a
smaller,
unpopular
party
whether
they
in
their
adherence
are
going
to
be
essentially
free
from
government
harassment
or
have
to
expose
their
contributors.
but
even
for
the
contributor
to
a
major
--
the
democrats
or
the
republicans
the
$125.00
contributor,
where
the
threshold
is
drawn
is
going
to
determined
whether
his
name
might
go
on
an
enemies
list
or
not
and
we
suggest
that
we
are
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
i
think
in
principle
there
is
no
difference.
however,
i
think
that
the
disclosure
of
one's
political
activities
at
whatever
volume
is
presumptively
invalid,
but
have
the
volume
of
the
large
contribution,
countervailing
government
interest
in
informing
the
electorate
of
those
individuals
who
make
large
contributions
in
preventing
corruption,
those
countervailing
interests
come
into
play.
so
that
that
is
how
i
would
make
the
distinction
between
the
interest
in
knowing
in
breaching
the
privacy
of
the
$125.00
contributor
and
the
interest
in
breaching
the
political
privacy
of
the
$125,000.00
contributor.
that
is
how
i
would
draw
the
line
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
it
would
depend
on
how
the
court
choose
to
approach
that
remedy.
there
is
a
severability
section
in
the
disclosure
provision
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
you
mean
in
terms
of
this
present
statute?
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
that
would
depend
justice
stewart
on
the
remedy
that
this
court
choose
to
employ.
now,
in
terms
of
dealing
with
sweeping
and
over
broad
statutes,
one
remedy,
the
potent
medicine
is
to
invalidate
on
its
face.
i
am
not
sure
that
necessary
here.
section
454
of
the
act
has
in
effect
the
severability
section,
which
reads
if
any
provision
of
this
title
or
the
application
thereof
to
any
person
or
circumstance
is
held
invalid,
the
rest
of
the
act
stands.
this
court
would
determine,
for
example,
that
the
failure
to
make
distinctions
between
the
two
major
parties
and
all
the
others
small
minors
parties
in
terms
of
disclosure
warranted
invalidating
the
statute.
i
assume
a
ruling
of
that
kind
would
leave
the
regular
disclosure
provisions
in
effect.
it
might
be
more
difficult
for
the
court
to
make
a
separation
out
in
terms
of
the
threshold,
so
i
would
grant
that,
but
i
think
that
the
statute
itself
obviously
contains
vaince
for
separating
out
major
and
minor
parties.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
technically,
justice
marshall
since
1910,
practically
since
april
7th
1972.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
pardon
me?
mr.
joel
m.
gora
just
has
not
been
challenged
that
we
are
aware
of
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
first
amendment
association
and
political
privacy
arguments
that
we
are
making
here.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
justice
white,
the
bulk
of
them
do.
the
count
varies,
you
get
a
different
figure
in
each
of
the
briefs
on
the
other
side.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
i
think
not
necessarily.
i
think
there
are
two
differences.
we
argue
the
minor
party
point
and
the
threshold
point.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
state
level,
the
level
of
spending
for
any
comparable
race,
a
state
senate
seat,
a
state
assembly
seat,
the
governorâ€™s
seat
is
probably
on
the
whole
much
lower
than
the
level
of
spending
in
any
comparable
congressional
or
presidential
race.
i
doubt
that
there
are
very
many
state
representative
races
that
spend
70
or
80
or
hundred
thousand
dollars,
so
that
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
yes,
i
am
suggesting
that
it
might
be
shown,
that
since
the
average
that
is
spent,
let
us
say
in
a
house
race
in
a
state,
in
assembly
race
is
$20,000.00
that
this
court
might
find
that
threshold
disclosure
there
might
have
to
be
lower
than
it
is
in
the
case
where
the
spending
limits
in
a
congressional
race
id
$100,00.00.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
at
all.
i
am
trying
to
respond
to
your
concern
about
the
effect
of
the
decision
that
we
seek
on
state
law
and
i
am
suggesting
that
in
terms
of
thresholds,
the
difference
between
federal
elections
and
state
elections
is
such
that
it
would
not
necessarily
be
controlling
and
i
would
say
the
same
thing
about
the
problem
of
minority
parties.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
i
think
the
basis
is
to
look
for
the
purpose
of
disclosure.
the
primary
purposed
that
has
been
advances
for
it
is
the
preventing
of
corruption
and
improper
influence
on
governmental
officials.
i
think
this
court
could
in
a
constitutional
way
require
that
the
disclosure
provisions
be
geared
to
the
level
at
which
improper
influence
can
be
brought
to
bear
by
virtue
of
a
contribution.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
i
think
justice
brennan,
i
do
not
think
it
is
this
court
obligation
to
pinpoint
that
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
no.
i
think
that
this
court
should
require
the
congress
to
look
at
these
problems
and
to
draw
some
lines.
i
have
looked
at
a
good
chunk
of
the
alleged
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
there,
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
the
minority
party
point,
but
there
lines
in
the
other
section
of
this
act,
regrettably
lines
which
discriminating
against
minority
party
and
the
threshold
problem
which
is
a
little
harder
to
make
distinctions
on,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
problem
is
that
congress
seemed
to
me,
to
my
study
of
the
legislative
history
to
be
essentially
indifferent
to
these
problems.
and
i
think
what
we
would
request
of
this
court
is
that
congress
be
required
to
think
about
these
things,
to
think
about
whether
you
really
want
to
require
the
public
identification
of
the
$125,000.00
contributor
to
the
small
party
or
even
to
the
presidential
party.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
one
would
certainly
hope
so,
but
i
think
that
as
i
said
there
are
basis
in
the
statute
justice
rehnquist
for
validating
the
application
to
smaller
and
minor
parties.
the
threshold
problem
presents
a
different
one
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
yes,
that
is
our
essential
submission
that
in
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
again
the
point
i
think
has
to
be
attempted
to
be
drawn
in
reference
to
the
purpose
of
having
disclosure.
if
the
purpose
is
not
just
promiscuous
to
find
out
whether
your
neighbor
gives
125
bucks
to
the
local
congressional
candidate,
there
is
a
presumption
that
is
one's
politics
are
one's
own
business.
that
is
why
when
the
purpose
is
in
terms
of
the
prevention
of
corruption
then
this
court
and
the
congress
must
ask
whether
the
disclosure
levels
are
drawn
to
meet
that
purpose,
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
precisely
our
point.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
our
point
--
mr.
joel
m.
gora
that
is
the
argument.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
well,
i
think
it
certainly
might.
i
mean,
they
are
cost
of
living
adjustments
in
the
statute,
but
again,
i
think
that
the
major
point
we
are
trying
to
make
is
that
this
court
has
to
require
the
congress
to
think
about
these
problems,
to
think
about
these
line
drawn
problems,
both
in
terms
of
the
threshold
of
reporting,
the
$10.00
record
keeping
and
the
$100.00
from
the
reporting
end
in
terms
of
the
application
to
minor
parties.
finally,
let
me
just
turn
for
a
moment
to
section
434
(e).
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
questions,
that
section
requires
that
any
private
citizen
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
candidate,
political
committees,
not
making
contribution
to
a
candidate
or
political
committee
wants
to
get
involved
in
political
activity,
wants
to
condemn
his
local
congressman
and
run
off
some
leaflets
and
spend
more
than
$100.00
doing
it,
that
person
has
to
register
with
the
federal
election
commission
and
supply
the
reports
required
of
political
committees.
we
think
that
provision
is
virtually
impossible
to
justify.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
flatly
in
contravention
of
the
principles
in
the
talley
case
where
this
court
protected
the
right
of
political
speech
and
unanimity
and
we
think
it
is
also
in
conflict
with
the
principles
of
the
thomas
case
where
this
court
rejected
the
application
of
just
a
mere
registration
requirement
upon
giving
a
speech.
section
434
(e)
runs
afoul
of
both
of
those
decisions.
and
let
me
finally
if
i
might,
in
terms
of
the
discrimination
against
small
and
minor
parties
that
this
disclosure
statute
involves,
it
has
been
our
contention
that
congress
simply
failed
to
consider
what
alternatives
were
available
to
deal
with
the
valid
interest
served
by
disclosure.
the
same
act
which
did
draw
a
sharp
and
unconstitutional
distinctions
when
it
came
to
dispersing
the
benefit
of
public
financing,
for
example,
to
know
such
distinctions
in
imposing
the
burdens
on
association
entailed
in
reporting
and
disclosure.
instead,
congress
indiscriminately
cast
a
net
across
the
entire
range
of
political
association,
that
is
manifest
by
contributions
to
a
party
without
regard
to
the
very
widely
varying
interest
at
stake.
analytically
this
court
found
such
an
approach
insufficient
in
robell
and
the
other
communist
membership
cases
and
we
would
submit
that
it
should
find
that
approach
insufficient
here.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
no,
we
have
not.
section
608
(e)
is
a
flat
ceiling
on
the
speech
of
persons
completely
unconnected
to
any
political
candidate
or
committee.
in
a
statute
with
a
lot
of
unconstitutionality,
we
submit
that
that
stands
out.
mr.
joel
m.
gora
that
is
our
submission,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
