mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
indicated,
i
will
begin
by
outlining
the
problems
that
congress
was
dealing
within
this
statute
and
then
rather
briefly
showing
how
the
particular
solution
selected
accomplished
those
objectives
and
then
i
will
discuss
in
some
detail,
the
reporting
in
disclosure
provisions.
mr.
cox
will
then
follow
and
discuss
the
contribution
and
expenditures
limitations.
since
early
in
this
century,
there
has
been,
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
autoworkers
case,
a
long
series
of
congressional
efforts
calculated
to
avoid
the
deleterious
influences
on
federal
elections,
resulting
from
use
of
money
by
those
who
exercise
control
over
large
aggregations
of
capital.
congress
first
faced
this
problem
back
in
1907
by
enacting
a
statute
prohibiting
certain
contributions
by
corporations
in
connection
with
elections.
in
the
autoworkers
case,
this
court
traced
it
at
some
length.
the
history
of
the
congressional
regulation
of
this
problem
what
it
described
as
series
of
acts
to
protect
the
political
process
from
what
congress
deemed
to
be
the
corroding
effect
of
money,
employed
in
elections
by
aggregated
power.
unfortunately
however,
as
these
statutes
were
enacted,
they
proved
to
have
so
many
loopholes
that
they
were
virtually
ineffective
in
doing
anything
about
the
problem.
and
beginning
in
1960’s,
in
the
late
1960’s,
congress
held
a
series
of
detailed
hearings,
exploring
all
aspects
of
the
problem.
these
culminated
in
a
1971
act,
the
initial
federal
elections
campaign
act
and
was
followed
by
the
present
amendment
in
1954.
now,
this
statute
therefore,
is
not
something
that
came
out
of
the
blue.
it
represents
the
result
of
many,
many
years
of
study,
three
quarters
of
a
century
by
the
congress,
the
body
that
is
particularly
expert
in
knowing
the
problems,
resulting
from
the
use
of
money,
the
corrupting
effect
of
money
on
federal
elections
and
congress
has
studied
the
problem,
has
recognized
that
when
things
do
not
work,
changes
are
necessary
and
congress
has
been
willing
to
change
in
this
area
and
to
try
the
devise
a
scheme
that
will
once
and
for
all,
we
hope
put
an
end
to
this
problem.
the
present
statute
of
course
is
a
direct
out
growth
of
the
disclosures
of
the
1972
campaign.
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
any
detail
with
that
sorry
and
sordid
story.
it
is
set
out
in
the
record.
it
is
a
matter
of
public
knowledge.
the
huge
campaign
contributions,
the
gifts
for
people
who
wanted
to
be
ambassadors,
the
campaign,
specific
large
contributions
in
connection
with
anticipated
favorable
government
actions
such
as
the
milk
producers,
a
large
number
of
corporate
officials
who
were
convicted
and
many
whom
pleaded
guilty
to
illegal
campaign
contributions
and
the
evidence
that
developed
of
the
vast
increase
in
the
cost
of
campaigns
in
this
country.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
sporadic
in
the
sense
that
congress
was
not
constantly
looking
at
the
problem,
but
over
a
number
of
times,
there
are
a
large
numbers
of
statutes
over
the
years
in
1900,
starting
in
1907
and
1910,
in
the
middle
of
the
second
decade,
the
corrupt
practices
act
of
1925.
gradually
over
the
years,
congress
realized
that
what
it
had
done
up
to
then
was
not
enough
to
solve
the
problem
and
looked
at
the
situation
and
devised
what
appeared
to
be
more
and
more
comprehensive
regulatory
things.
it
expanded
the
type
of
controls
that
extended
during
war,
the
prohibition
on
gifts
from
corporations
to
unions,
as
problems
developed
congress
studied
them.
but
my
point
is
that
over
a
long
period
of
time,
congress
has
considered
these
problems,
studied
them
and
devised
schemes
to
deal
with
what
it
perceived
to
be
an
increasingly
serious
evil
in
the
body
politic,
the
corruption
of
federal
elections
by
the
use
of
money
and
the
cost
of
these
campaigns
has
risen
at
the
staggering
rate.
it
is
really
the
staggering
rate
and
at
page
35
of
mr.
cox’s
brief,
there
is
a
chart
which
shows
the
increase
in
campaign
cost
reflected
to
show
increases
in
a
consumer
price
index.
and
what
it
shows
is
over
a
20-year
period,
from
1952,
the
1972,
after
adjustments
to
reflect
increases
in
the
cost
of
living,
the
cost
of
congressional
races
increased
more
than
300%
and
over
the
10-year
period,
1962
to
1972,
the
cost
of
presidential
races
with
the
similar
adjustment
increased
more
than
450%.
and
by
1972,
it
was
estimated
that
the
total
cost
of
elections
in
this
country
exceeded
approximately
$400
million.
now,
what
is
the
consequence
of
this
escalating
cost?
it
is
a
vicious
circle
because
when
one
candidate
sees
another
candidate
spending
more
and
more,
he
feels
impelled
to
spend
more
and
more.
as
the
cost
of
these
campaigns
increase,
the
candidates
naturally
turn
to
where
the
money
is,
the
easiest
source
of
money,
those
are
the
wealthy
interests.
once
a
wealthy
interest
gives
a
campaign
contribution,
his
competitors,
other
businessmen
also
feel
obliged
to
give
because
they
are
concerned
that
if
they
do
not
give,
either
they
will
be
discriminated
against
by
government
officials
or
their
competitors
will
gain
an
advantage
as
result
for
these
contributions.
and
thus,
the
candidates
as
result
of
this
thing
feel
more
and
more
obligated
to
the
sources,
the
large
sources
of
campaign
contribution.
and
it
is
not
surprising
with
this
history,
that
by
the
early
1970’s,
there
was
a
tremendous
feeling
in
this
country
that
you
could
not
trust
the
government,
a
lack
of
electric
confidence
in
our
government
officials,
the
notion
that
somehow
people
could
be
bought.
if
you
gave
enough
money,
people
could
be
bought
and
conversely
correspondingly
really,
the
average
man
who
was
not
very
affluent,
who
did
have
access
to
all
these
sources,
he
believed
that
it
was
rather
feel
for
him
to
try
to
play
an
active
role
in
the
campaign.
for
one
thing
if
you
want
to
run
through
office,
he
knew
he
could
not
raise
these
sources
money
and
secondly
if
he
wanted
to
try
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may
not
be
quite
as
simple
mr.
justice,
but
i
do
think
it
is
a
very
serious
problem.
as
a
good
example,
i
think
of
this
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
in
many
campaigns
in
recent
years
the
same
interests
have
contributed
to
two
candidates
who
running
against
each
other.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
that
hardly
suggests
that
they
have
a
strong
commitment
to
one
candidate.
those
people
are
obviously
hopeful
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
perhaps
and
perhaps
not,
but
with
this
exception
mr.
justice
that
both
of
these
people,
whoever
is
the
victorious
is
likely
to
feel
the
sense
of
obligation
to
the
person
who
gave
him
this
contribution.
that
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sorry?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
assume
so.
i
suspect
perhaps
some
people
in
the
congress
are
aware
of
this
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
influenced
them
to
require
both
limits
on
contributions
and
disclosure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that
i
do
not
think
was
the
problem
that
concerned
congress
in
this
legislation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
limits
would
apply,
if
it
--
well,
it
would
depend
whether
this
--
they
may
not
apply
because
that
would
not
be,
i
do
not
think
a
contribution
directed
to
the
influencing
the
election
or
nomination
of
the
particular
candidate.
i
do
not
think
that
it
will
be
anything
in
the
statute
prohibiting
that
kind
of
a
sponsorship
of
a
public
forum.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
those
would
be
valid
motivations,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that
has
to
be
weighed
against
the
judgment
of
congress
that
overall,
overall
the
evils
resulting
from
the
substantial
increase
in
campaign
spending
and
the
giving
of
large
contributions,
that
these
evils
are
as
such
as
to
require
some
regulation
to
try
to
stop
this
increasing
spiral
of
campaign
cost
and
try
to
restore
public
confidence.
i
think
it
is
important
element
that
the
lack
of
public
confidence,
if
the
public
believes,
if
the
public
believes
that
large
contributions
have
a
corrupting
effect
upon
electoral
process
and
upon
government
and
the
record
here
contains
a
lot
of
evidence
to
that
effect.
that
is
a
valid
consideration
for
congress
to
take
into
account.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
let
me
if
i
may
--
that
is
a
$100.00
disclosure
limit,
that
is
the
small
contributes
a
thousand
dollars.
our
answer
to
that
is
the
disclosure
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
he
can
give
up
to
a
thousand,
he
can
give
up
to
a
thousand,
but
more
than
--
if
he
gives
more
than
a
hundred,
that
has
to
be
disclosed.
our
answer
to
that
is
disclosure
serves
two
important
objectives.
one,
which
i
think
our
opponents
have
recognized,
is
that
it
does
serve
an
informing
function.
it
tells
the
electoral
whose
backing
whom.
it
shows
who
their
friends
are
and
this
is
an
important
element
because
in
making
the
choice,
when
the
electorate
makes
the
choice
it
should
know
who
is
behind
whom
in
these
cases.
indeed,
i
dispose
a
rather
simple
hypothetical.
suppose
you
have
a
keen
congressional
race
in
which
both
candidates
are
urging
that
they
are
dedicated
to
improving
in
cleaning
up
the
environment
and
this
is
keenly
contested
thing,
each
one
accuses
the
other
of
not
being
sympathetic
to
the
environment.
i
think
it
would
be
highly
significant
to
the
voters
in
this
district,
if
they
knew
that
a
large
number
officials
of
several
of
the
firms
in
this
district
that
were
accused
of
being
the
leading
polluters
had
all
contributed
to
one
of
the
candidates,
that
would
be
very
significant.
now,
let
me
add
one
other
thing
on
the
$100.00
amount
which
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
extent
that
section
610
permits
it.
that
is,
they
have
to
have
a
separate
independent
fund
from
which
contributions
are
made.
all
of
these
activities
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
think
so.
once
it
gets
into
the
separate
fund,
but
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
not
sure
mr.
justice
that
all
of
those
contributions
would
be
permitted
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
pipefitters
case,
the
fund,
the
independent
fund
cannot
be
under
the
control
of
the
either
the
corporation
or
the
union.
it
is
has
to
be
an
independent
fund
and
i
do
not
know
how
many
of
those
contributions
that
you
refer
to,
would
in
fact
be
permitted
under
the
statute.
my
other
answer
is
that
perhaps,
perhaps
at
some
point
congress
will
feel
it
necessary
to
close
and
cut
down
on
the
corporate
and
union
contributions
that
are
now
permitted
under
610,
but
that
it
seems
to
me
is
another
matter.
the
fact
that
it
is
permitted
under
that
particular
provision,
i
do
not
think
is
a
reason
for
saying
that
congress
cannot
act
under
this
statute
as
it
has.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
problems
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
is
a
problem
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so
and
that
is
an
issue
that
initially,
i
suppose
the
federal
election
commission
will
have
the
resolve.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
610.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
we
have
to
kind
of
pause
this
two
together
and
see
how
you
fit
them
together.
congress
did
not
intend.
i
do
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
terms,
but
it
maybe
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
in
terms
610
which
is
an
old
statute,
was
not
enacted
with
this
in
mind,
but
there
will
be
problems
of
the
extent
to
which
the
limitations
of
this
statute
would
apply
to
those
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
it
would
because
a
problem
may
come
up
whether
a
particular
fund
of
a
cooperation
or
union
can
make
a
sizable
contribution.
under
the
statute
normally,
this
would
be
put
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
could
give
an
advisory
opinion
on
it.
but
let
me
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
do
not
say
they
are
free
to
give
what
they
want
to
it.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
these
special
funds
have
been
locked
in,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
or
subjected
to
the
limitations
of
the
statute.
now,
there
is
a
provision
saying
that
political
committees
may
give
up
$5,000.00.
that
applies
not
only
to
--
if
these
funds
are
political
committee
--
i
am
not
suggesting
mr.
justice
that
congress
is
barred
in
anyway
from
imposing
the
limits
upon
cooperations.
the
only
question
is
whether
congress
in
this
statute,
whether
congress
in
this
statute
has
not
tied
the
knot
and
closed
the
ends
as
effectively
as
it
perhaps
it
might
have.
i
do
not
think
that
congress
can
be
faulted
because
in
dealing
with
what
it
perceived
as
the
general
problem
of
large
corporations,
it
did
not
specifically
say
a
no
union
fund
or
no
cooperation
fund
may
exceed
these
limitations.
i
think
congress
left
it
somewhat
unclear
because
of
the
question
whether
these
funds
would
be
committees
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
perhaps
i
misspoke
myself
and
did
not
make
myself
clear.
this
provisions
apply
not
only
to
individuals,
but
to
unions
into
corporations.
congress
has
not
said
that
corporations
and
unions
are
to
be
treated
differently
from
individuals
with
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
perhaps,
segregated
funds,
but
then
again
all
that
congress,
all
that
has
happened
in
this
situation
is
congress
has
not
gone
as
far
as
it
might
gone
in
this
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
not
mr.
justice
because
there
has
been
as
far
as
i
know
no
ruling
on
that,
thus
far.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
difficult
question
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
that
i
would
be
rotten
to
take
a
position
on,
but
i
think
the
normal
practice,
the
way
the
commission
functions
is
if
they
were
a
question,
a
request
would
be
made
to
the
agency
for
an
advisory
opinion.
if
i
may
come
back
to
the
disclosure
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
is
some
quite,
i
would
have
to
say
some
doubt
that
because
o
do
not
--
let
me
say
this,
if
i
may
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
think
nearly
as
clear
as
the
statement
in
amicus
brief
suggests
that
corporations
and
unions
as
a
practical
matter
may
make
unlimited
contributions
in
the
course
of
campaigns
through
the
use
of
these
funds.
if
i
may
returned
again
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
will
not
because
under
the
statute
and
the
statute
explicitly
provides
that
anyone
who
is
a
candidate
for
office
can
ask
for
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
federal
election
commission
which
the
commission
is
required
to
answer
and
if
he
gets
that
opinion,
it
is
presumed
that
if
he
acts
in
reliance
on
this
opinion,
he
has
acted
in
accordance
with
law.
so,
people
are
not
left
wholly
at
large
to
worry
about
it.
they
can
get
an
advisory
ruling
and
the
commission
has
already
given
20
to
30
advisory
rulings
on
these
topics.
so,
there
is
not
in
this
case
the
danger
of
somebody
going
to
jail
without
being
able
to
get
some
advice.
they
can
get
advice
from
the
expert
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
in
much
the
same
way
that
anyone
who
is
subject
to
a
regulatory
statute
has
problems
about
whether
or
not
he
has
violated
the
statute.
but,
again
that
is
not
a
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
is
faced
in
this
case
because
the
time
to
really
decide
that
question
i
would
suppose
is
if
and
when
someone
is
charged
with
having
violated
the
statute
by
making
that
kind
of
a
contribution.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
too
can
play
a
role
in
a
election.
they
can
play
a
role
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
struck
down
disclosure
requirements
are
cases
in
which
one
of
two
things
have
happened.
either
this
been
a
clear
evidence
that
disclosure
will
produce
harassment
or
chills
such
as
in
some
of
the
naacp
cases.
in
naacp,
we
have
a
battle
where
they
put
in
uncontroverted
evidence
with
respect
to
the
adverse
effects
that
resulted
from
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
again
there
were
not.
let
me
come
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
equation,
all
cases
in
which
there
was
no
showing
of
any
substantial
compelling
state
interest.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
is
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
slam
with
respect
to
the
possible
harassment
of
disclosure.
there
were
three
minor
instances
in
which
there
was
a
slight
suggestion
and
our
position
to
that
five
representatives
of
minority
parties
indicated
that
as
far
as
they
could
tell,
there
was
no
indication
either
the
people
would
refused
to
contribute,
if
they
were
disclosed
or
that
anyone
whose
disclosure
had
been
made
public,
his
contribution
had
been
disclosed,
was
in
fact
subject
to
any
harassment.
these
minority
parties
play
an
important
role.
they
can
affect
the
influence
of
an
election
by
drawing
votes
away
from
one
to
the
other.
at
page
179,
in
footnote
210
of
this
blue
brief
filed
by
the
center
for
public
financing
of
elections
and
others,
they
give
three
indications,
three
examples
of
the
so
called
stalking
horse
phenomenon
in
which
a
political
party
sponsors
a
minority
candidate
in
the
hope
of
drawing
votes
away
from
the
opponent.
that
is
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
one
other
thing
about
these
disclosure
provisions
which
think
is
very
important
to
remember.
on
its
face
one
might
say,
“well,
who
cares
about
a
$100.00
contribution.”
a
$100.00
contribution
is
not
going
to
corrupt
anyone
and
why
set
the
limit
this
low?
the
answer
i
think
is
two-fold.
first,
this
is
a
very
useful
method
for
enforcing
the
statute
because
and
particularly
where
the
overall
limit
is
$1,000.00,
a
contribution
of
a
hundred
cannot
said
to
be
in
substantial,
but
equally
or
perhaps
more
important
is
the
problem
of
culminating
of
combining
contributions.
if
you
have
a
large
number
of
people
who
are
a
affiliated,
who
do
combine
contributions
again
in
this
blue
brief
on
page
174,
an
example
is
cited
how
a
senator
on
one
day,
in
his
senatorial
campaign
received
247
individual
contributions
totaling
$28,000.00
from
the
employees
of
one
single
corporation.
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
the
kind
of
information
that
is
very
useful
to
the
electors.
they
like
to
know
if
a
large
group
of
affiliated
people
have
a
sufficient
community
of
interest
that
they
all
favor
a
candidate,
that
is
again
the
same
kind
of
thing
as
the
general
disclosure
of
who
is
backing
the
candidate.
that
is
the
sort
information
that
people
would
like
to
have.
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
in
fact,
if
the
amicus
brief
is
correct
that
this
is
not
a
political
committee,
but,
again
mr.
justice
i
think
the
answer
is
that
perhaps
if
it
should
turnout
that
this
device
of
the
contributions
by
independent
funds
is
another
technique
that
has
been
used
to
evade
these
statutory
provisions
as
we
have
these
mobile
committees
in
the
past,
congress
may
at
some
future
date
see
fit
once
again
to
amend
the
federal
election
campaign
laws
to
close
that
loophole
if
it
is
prove
to
be
loophole.
but
our
point
is
that
the
presence
statute
is
a
reasonable
effort
made
by
congress
to
deal
with
this
problem
and
that
why
we
think
there
is
a
very
little,
if
any,
chilling
effect
to
whatever
extent
there
maybe
some
slide
show
we
think
that
is
more
than
off
set
by
the
very
strong
compelling
governmental
interest
in
trying
to
protect
the
integrity
of
federal
elections.
a
compelling
interest
which
we
think
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
justifies
any
possibly
slight
showing
effect
that
these
provisions
may
have
upon
the
exercise
of
that
most
fundamental
of
all
our
rights,
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
theory
is
that
and
the
record
indicates
that
large
contributions
have
been
made
on
both
sides
of
the
allied.
i
think
congress
was
not
concerned
that
the
large
contributions
will
favor
in
one
side
of
the
other.
congress
was
concerned
that
the
large
contributions
were
having
a
corrupting
effect
on
the
electoral
process.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
i
would
say
that
this
is
--
to
us
this
is
not
speech.
this
is
money.
money
obviously
called
as
important
connection
with
speech,
but
it
seems
to
me
what
congress
was
concerned
here
was
not
with
attempting
to
in
anyway
limit
total
speech
limit
conduct.
congress
was
concerned
here
with
the
effect,
the
effect
that
these
large
contributions
no
matter
what
the
political
persuasion
of
the
recipient,
with
the
effect
these
large
contributions
would
have
upon
the
whole
process.
and
i
think
congress
as
this
court's
decisions
have
made
clear,
going
way
back
to
burroughs
and
cannon
(ph)
in
1934,
congress
has
the
power
to
deal
with
the
corruption
that
results
from
this
infusion
of
money.
and
i
do
not
think
that.
congress
was
attempting
to
say
that,
well,
there
is
too
much
speech
here
and
what
we
going
to
do
is
cut
down
the
amount
of
speech.
congress
was
saying
there
too
much
money
being
spent
and
the
money
has
bad
effects
and
we
are
going
to
try
to
cut
down
the
amount
of
money.
now,
to
some
extent
to
be
sure,
to
some
extent
cutting
down
the
money
is
going
to
cut
down
on
the
volume
necessarily
of
speech,
but
it
seems
to
me
this
is
an
incidental
effect.
the
main
trust
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
of
course
not
mr.
justice.
i
am
suggesting,
i
am
suggesting
that
in
this
area
when
we
doing
with
this
kind
of
a
restriction,
when
we
are
dealing
with
this
kind
of
a
restriction
that
the
compelling
interest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
or
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
our
basic.
if
i
may
we
rephrase
it
slightly,
any
adverse
impact
upon
first
amendment
rights
is
overridden
by
the
compelling
government
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
money
affects
speech,
but
i
would
not
agree
that
money
is
the
same
thing
as
speech
because
not
every
contribution
that
is
made
to
a
political
candidate
is
used
for
speech.
they
maybe
used
for
many
things
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
if
it
is
rather
difficult
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
specific
bribery,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
purchasing
a
vote
in
the
crude
sense,
if
it
is
bribery.
but
there
are
other
subtle
influences
that
work
which
may
not
come
to
the
purchase
of
a
vote,
but
which
may
nevertheless
have
the
same
effect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
question
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
protection
to
these
interests.
as
we
see
the
issue
it
is
whether
whatever
adverse
impact
the
statute
has
on
the
exercise
of
those
rights
is
outweighed
by
what
we
deem
to
be
the
clearly
compelling
government
interest
underlying
the
legislation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
cox
will
i
think
be
discussing
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
do
not
--
but
of
course
not
mr.
justice.
what
i
was
suggesting
is
that
this
court
in
a
number
of
its
decisions
has
recognized
the
key
role
that
elections
play
in
our
democracy
and
i
was
suggesting
that
what
congress
was
doing
in
this
statute
was
attempting
to
protect
the
integrity
of
that
right
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
whole
electoral
process.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
the
statute
does
at
least
we
think
congress
is
attempting
to
do
--
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
restraints
upon
first
amendment
rights,
you
have
spectrum.
you
have
the
immediate
prohibition
that
someone
cannot
speak,
cannot
publish
then
you
begin
to
shift
over
and
it
is
seems
to
me
as
the
impact
upon
first
amendment
rights
becomes
less
direct
and
more
incidental,
you
can
give
greater
weight
i
would
think
to
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
in
imposing
those
limitations.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sure
you
are
and
i
hope
you
would
resolve
it
the
way
congress
has
resolved
it.
