mr.
brice
m.
clagett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant’s
position
is;
first,
that
any
mechanism
for
direct
federal
funding
of
political
parties
and
candidates
is
unconstitutional
and
second
that
the
particular
mechanism
congress
has
chosen,
embraces
a
number
of
unconstitutional
discriminations
among
particular
candidates
and
parties.
with
the
court’s
indulgence,
i
will
reverse
the
order
of
our
briefs
and
discuss
the
second
question
first.
i
begin
with
chapter
95
which
provides
for
general
election
federal
subsidies
for
some,
but
not
all
presidential
candidates.
the
basic
device
of
course
is
the
distinction
between
major
parties,
which
one
more
than
25%
of
the
vote
in
the
prior
election.
minor
parties
which
won
between
5%
and
25%
and
so
called
new
parties
which
are
they
really
are
new
or
else
are
old
won
less
than
5%
at
the
prior
election.
major
party
candidates
are
wholly
relieved
of
the
need
to
seek
private
contributions.
they
are
furnished
their
entire
expenditure
limit
$20
million
at
the
outset
of
the
campaign.
minor
parties,
if
there
are
any
which
they
would
not
be
in
1976,
receive
a
prorata
share,
dependent
on
the
ratio
of
their
prior
vote
to
the
average
vote
of
the
major
parties.
new
parties
receive
nothing,
but
if
they
win
over
5%
of
the
vote
in
the
in
the
current
election,
they
purportedly
can
receive
post
election
funding,
though
we
shall
see
that,
that
alleged
entitlement
is
almost
completely
illusory.
independent
candidates
not
identified
with
the
party,
receive
nothing
at
any
stage,
no
matter
what
their
vote
is.
a
most
serious
problem
with
this
scheme
is
the
treatment
of
new
parties.
we
think
the
5%
threshold
first,
although
this
is
not
the
most
serious
objection,
is
too
high.
it
is
much
more
onerous
than
the
nominally
similar
threshold
sustained
for
ballot
access
in
jeness
versus
fortson
because
that
scheme
allowed
petition
signed
by
persons
who
at
the
prior
election
have
voted
for
other
parties.
since
this
is
clearly
a
prior
vote
qualification
it
requires
that
the
member
of
the
5%
not
have
voted
for
anyone
else
and
not
to
stay
at
home.
the
jeness
court
relied
heavily
on
the
open
aspects
of
the
5%
that
anyone
could
sign
the
petition
even
if
he
just
voted
in
a
primary
two
weeks
before
that
for
another
party
and
in
jeness
you
upheld
that
5%
figure
with
strong
intimations
that
were
not
for
those
open
features
not
present
here,
5%
would
be
too
high.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
not
if
it
is
a
major
candidate,
justice
brennan
then
he
gets
his
full
20
million
and
he
has
to
promise
and
address
that
he
would
not
take
any
private
contributions.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
think
practical
answer
would
be
that
he
would
know,
he
is
not
the
major
party
candidate
who
qualifies
until
after
the
convention
and
surely
by
the
time
the
convention
or
immediately
thereafter
he
would
make
his
decision
which
route
he
is
going.
if
he
is
a
minor
party
candidate,
he
just
has
to
agree
not
to
take
any
contributions
that
would
put
him
over
to
the
limit
and
it
says
in
addition
to
whatever
public
funds
he
gets.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
primary
expenses
well
that
chapter
96
which
i
like
to
deal
with
separately
if
i
might.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that
is
matching
funds
and
the
issues
are
quite
different.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
the
5%
requirement
involved
in
this
statute
is
very
much
like
the
5%
requirement
which
you
are
unable
to
accept
in
storer
versus
brown,
very
much
like
it
functionally.
it
is
relevant
here
by
the
way
i
think
that
42
states
for
ballot
access
have
1%
or
less
as
a
petition
requirement.
the
other
side
is
relied
for
other
purposes
on
state
practice
and
the
general
state
practice
is
that
1%
is
about
the
maximum
which
is
thought
reasonable
to
require
on
petitions
for
ballot
access.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
two
factors
maybe
comparable
by
analysis.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
ten
or
fewer.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir.
the
most
egregious
discrimination
in
chapter
95
is
that
no
way
is
provided
for
new
parties
to
qualify
by
petition
at
all.
they
are
excluded
entirely
on
the
basis
of
prior
vote
performance.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
again
that
throughout,
i
will
be
using
new
parties
in
the
sense
the
statute
does,
that
party
could
be
a
hundred
years
old
and
still
be
a
new
party.
in
view
of
the
dead
hand
of
the
prior
election
in
wholly
excluding
new
parties,
the
reliance
of
appellees
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
indeed
on
jeness
versus
fortson,
we
think
is
completely
misplaced
because
the
statute
upheld
in
that
case
permitted
a
petition
requirement,
the
5%
there
was
a
petition
5%,
not
a
prior
vote
5%.
indeed
every
one
of
the
ballot
access
cases
involved
a
petition
alternative
route
to
get
on
the
ballot,
instead
of
being
limited
or
excluded
on
the
basis
of
prior
vote
statistics.
some
of
those
means
you
have
held
too
onerous,
and
some
of
them
you
have
held
reasonable,
but
in
everyone
of
the
cases
there
was
a
route.
here
there
is
not
route,
no
way.
if
a
party
one
year
after
the
1976
election
or
three
years
after
the
1976
election
comes
into
existence,
there
will
be
no
way
it
can
receive
prior
pre-election
funding
in
the
1980
election.
appellees
have
failed
to
suggest
any
reason
whatever,
like
qualification
for
federal
funds
by
a
petition
could
not
and
should
not
have
been
incorporated
in
chapter
95.
such
a
readily
available
mechanism
while
solving
all
constitutional
problems,
would
have
provided
a
new
party
with
some
means
to
qualify.
it
will
avoid
that
the
plain
irrationality
of
making
illegibility
for
these
subsidies
depend
entirely
on
four-year
old
election
statistics
when
conditions
may
have
been
totally
different.
post
election
funding
which
the
statute
purports
to
provide
is
no
solution.
obviously,
funds
provided
after
the
election
is
over
are
off
no
use
whatever
to
a
party
in
trying
to
win
the
election
or
to
make
the
substantial
impact
on
it.
moreover,
if
that
were
enough,
this
theoretical
entitlement
to
post
election
funding
is
rendered
almost
completely
illusory
by
the
provision
that
it
can
be
used
only
to
repay
loans,
which
is
what
the
statutes
says.
the
result
will
be
that
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
a
new
party’s
expenditures,
if
any,
will
be
reimbursable,
even
though
the
party
otherwise
qualifies.
no
reason
has
ever
been
suggested
to
our
knowledge
why
that
restriction
could
not
have
been
omitted
and
new
party
is
allowed
to
recover
post
election
funding,
if
they
qualify
by
five
or
some
other
percent,
could
recover
subsidies
equivalent
to
the
amount
of
their
expenditures,
not
of
their
expenditures
made
through
loans,
then
they
could
have
used
that
money
for
their
general
party
purposes
or
to
prepare
for
the
next
election.
they
at
least
would
have
gotten
something
that
might
do
them
some
good
in
the
future,
even
though
it
would
not
do
them
any
good
in
the
current
election.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
the
libertarian
party,
the
conservative
party
of
new
york.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no
sir
that
is
a
part
of
the
national
republican
party
which
is
a
major
party.[laughter]
if
we
had
congressional
public
financing,
it
might
well
qualify
and
the
appellees
are
trying
to
get
that
too.
senator
metcalf's
amicus
brief
points
out
entirely
accurately
that
this
incredible
restriction
that
you
can
only
get
post
election
funding
to
pay
back
loans
that
you
have
made
that
you
have
incurred,
that
this
restriction
penalizes
new
parties
for
having
been
able
to
raise
contributions
rather
than
make
expenditures
on
credit.
whereas
for
major
parties
under
chapter
96,
major
party
candidates
of
the
primary
stage
are
rewarded
for
getting
contributions,
just
makes
no
sense
to
us,
unless
the
purpose
is
discriminatory,
certain
the
result
is.
this
system,
especially
when
coupled
with
the
expenditure
and
contribution
limits,
leaves
new
parties
far
worse
off
than
they
are
now.
they
are
declared
unworthy,
if
federal
funding
because
of
their
modest
support,
but
simultaneously
they
are
denied
the
right
to
try
to
increase
that
support
by
seeking
large
contributions
to
pay
for
heightened
campaign
activity.
in
fact,
in
presidential
general
elections
since
the
major
parties
are
fully
subsidized.
the
contribution
limits
apply
only
to
minor
and
new
parties
and
independent
candidates.
only
they
must
bear
the
burden
of
those
limitations
and
must
incur
the
large
cost
of
trying
to
raise
small
contributions.
the
contribution
limits
of
the
presidential
election,
the
general
election
stage
have
no
effect
whatever
on
the
major
parties.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no,
justice
white,
it
would
not.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
the
expenditure
limits
are
bit
academic
as
a
part
to
minor
parties
at
least
at
the
presidential
level.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
the
contributions
limits
are
by
no
means
are
academic,
but
even
if
minor
parties
were
free
to
raise
large
contributions,
they
would
still
have
to
raise
money
privately
while
the
major
parties
were
being
subsidized
by
the
federal
government
and
we
know
of
a
no
rational
basis
for
that
discrimination,
certainly
not
at
the
5%
prior
vote
threshold
level.
possibly
at
a
1%
current
petition
threshold
level
maybe.
we
are
not
saying
there
is
no
threshold
that
might
not
be
constitutional,
excuse
me,
that
might
be
constitutional.
appellees
answer
to
all
these
discriminations
as
the
third
parties
and
independents
are
benefited
by
the
expenditure
limitation
since
they
will
now
be
able
to
spend
more
in
relation
to
major
party
spending,
but
you
cannot
spend
money
if
you
cannot
raise
it
and
nobody
gives
it
to
you.
even
besides
that,
a
minor
party
is
not
concerned
with
what
a
major
party
spends.
it
is
sole
interest
is
being
able
to
raise
and
spend
itself
enough
to
wage
a
viable
campaign
thus
for
someone
like
the
appellant
libertarian
party,
i
can
assure
you
that
it
does
not
feel
fortunate
because
the
democrats
and
republicans
are
now
limited
to
$20
million
each
when
it
is
cut
off
from
every
reasonable
sources
of
funds
to
wage
any
kind
of
campaign
that
could
get
itself
better
known
and
maybe
gradually
over
a
process
of
years
make
some
progress
towards
becoming
a
major
party,
which
is
of
course
it
is
objective.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
do
not
believe
the
libertarian
candidate
for
president
this
year
believes
he
will
elected,
but
it
is
not
only
an
issue
campaign.
i
think
any
party
of
this
nature
will
be
looking
ahead
down
the
road
to
future
elections,
maybe
eight
years
from
now,
maybe
12
years
from
now.
that
is
a
party
of
the
kind
of
libertarian
party’s
nature.
now,
there
are
other
kinds
of
third
parties
which
would
be
also
new
parties
under
the
statute.
the
american
independent
party
would
have
been
a
new
party
in
1968
and
would
have
been
completely
shut
out
from
campaign
financing.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no
sir,
it
would
have
been
a
new
party
in
1856
and
that
is
where
it
would
have
had
its
throat
cut.[laughter]
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
precisely.
one
bizarre
result
of
this
statute
is
that
if
a
third
party
ever
does
manage
to
qualify
for
federal
funds,
its
life
will
be
unnaturally
and
artificially
prolonged.
if
these
provisions
have
been
in
effect
in
1972,
john
schmitz
would
have
received
more
than
$6
million
in
federal
general
election
subsidies
on
the
basis
of
george
wallace’s
election
day
performance
in
1968.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir,
but
third
parties
typically
arise
we
think
and
george
wallace's
1968
candidacy
is
maybe
not
wholly
typical,
but
it
is
not
wholly
a
typical
either.
they
typically
arise
either
to
give
some
outlet
to
a
transient
wave
of
popular
sentiment
or
is
the
vehicle
of
a
particular
candidate
which
was
certainly
true
of
wallace
in
1968.
john
schmitz
just
did
not
have
the
capacity
to
draw
that
kind
of
vote.
if
a
party
of
that
sort
makes
a
substantial
impact
in
one
election,
then
the
usual
consequence
is
that
it
goes
on
to
higher
things
or
else
the
other
party
is
adjusted
and
it
is
absorbed
back
into
one
of
the
major
parties.
but
artificial
preservation
of
third
parties
whose
time
has
passed
is
an
inevitable
result
of
basing
federal
subsidies
on
prior
election
performance.
i
must
say
something
about
chapter
96,
the
matching
grant
provision.
the
subsidy
amount
that
candidates
can
receive
under
matching
grounds
is
made
wholly
dependent
on
the
private
contributions
that
candidate
has
raised,
that
is
it
is
a
wealth
criterion,
similar
to
one
you
struck
down
in
bullock
versus
carter
and
lubin
versus
panish.
surely
what
should
matter
is
the
number
of
contributors
to
or
supporters
of
a
candidate.
instead
a
single
contributor
can
command
the
matching
firms
checked
off
by
250
of
his
fellow
citizens
on
their
tax
returns.
the
entire
scheme
rewards
the
candidate
who
gets
into
the
race
earliest,
who
can
command
the
largest
number
of
$250
contributors
and
who
is
supported
by
a
special
interests,
which
can
easily
help
him
meet
the
20-state
requirement.
a
candidate
who
comes
in
at
the
later
stage,
perhaps
in
response
to
some
new
development
or
some
newly
perceived
political
issue
is
heavily
disadvantaged.
the
provision
is
in
fact
working
exactly
in
this
way.
that
is
demonstrated
by
the
figures
on
page
52
of
our
reply
brief,
showing
what
the
presidential
candidates
have
raised
to
date
and
what
they
have
on
hand.
it
is
apparent
from
those
figures
that
the
great
bulk
of
available
federal
funds
is
likely
to
go
to
only
two
of
the
twelve
present
candidates,
governor
wallace
and
senator
jackson.
most
of
the
others
even
though
have
raised
substantial
private
funds,
have
dissipated
almost
all
of
them
before
the
campaign
for
votes
even
begins.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
52.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
--
have
dissipated
almost
all
the
funds
they
raised,
you
can
see
that
by
the
right
hand
column
showing
what
they
have
on
hand,
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
raise
more
small
contributions.
most
of
these
candidates
will
be
so
crippled
for
funds
that
whatever
federal
matching
grounds
they
receive
will
not
prevent
them
from
being
driven
out
of
the
race
at
very
early
stage.
this
legislation
has
made
money
more
important
in
campaigning
than
it
was
before,
not
less
important
as
it
allegedly
was
supposed
to
do.
those
problems
are
compounded
by
the
fact
that
the
mechanism
for
dispersing
the
matching
grounds
is
so
fraught
with
uncertainty
and
so
dependent
on
diaphanous
prophesies
that
have
to
made
long
before
they
can
be
made,
that
the
results
maybe
unfair
or
random
in
the
extreme.
we
set
out
some
of
these
problems
at
pages
70
through
73
of
our
reply
brief.
the
day
after
that
brief
was
filed,
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
treasury,
testifying
before
the
federal
election
commission,
confirmed
everyone
of
those
concerns
we
had
expressed
and
added
some
new
ones.
we
have
lodged
this
testimony
with
the
court.
it
is
now
clear
after
his
testimony
that
funds
maybe
inadequate
to
pay
all
the
candidates
who
qualify
and
that
what
funds
are
made
available
will
depend
on
guesses
as
to
what
third
parties
may
enter
the
ultimate
general
action
campaign
and
what
their
election
day
performance
might
be,
this
in
december
or
january
and
there
is
a
distinct
possibility
that
all
the
available
funds
will
be
exhausted
by
the
first
two
candidates
who
qualify,
wallace
and
jackson,
thus
discriminating
against
those
who
qualify
thereafter.
finally,
the
difficult
decisions
that
must
be
made
by
a
partisan
political
appointee.
president
ford,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
going
to
decide
how
much
money
president
ford
and
mr.
reagan
get
for
the
new
hampshire
primary,
that
is
a
curious
litigate
for
forum.
there
are
other
discriminations
that
i
have
not
even
been
able
to
touch
on
like
the
exclusion
of
appellant
mccarthy
solely
on
the
ground
that
he
is
an
independent
rather
than
affiliated
with
a
political
party
from
any
subsidies
at
any
stage.
we
think
that
some
problems
of
this
nature,
whether
the
same
ones
or
other
ones
will
be
present
in
any
kind
of
federal
subsidy
scheme
that
is
formulated.
any
such
scheme
will
establish
some
parties
by
favoring
them
over
others,
just
as
this
scheme
establishes
the
two
existing
major
parties.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
in
abington
school
district
versus
schempp,
the
most
effective
way
to
establish
any
institution
is
to
finance
it.
such
political
establishments,
we
think,
cannot
be
squared
with
freedom
of
speech
of
association
or
with
the
general
welfare
or
indeed
with
the
provisions
of
articles
1
and
2
which
contemplate
free
elections
in
this
country.
most
of
these
objections
would
not
apply
to
a
genuine
check
off
scheme,
whereby
each
citizen
would
designate
party
or
a
candidate
to
receive
the
sum
he
checked
off.
there
is
nothing
impractical
about
a
scheme
like
that
as
we
have
shown
in
our
reply
brief.
if
there
is
anyone
for
federal
involvement
in
the
campaign
funding
mechanism
at
all,
such
a
method
would
plainly
be
less
intrusive
mean.
thank
you.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
mr.
cutler’s
last
point
was
that
the
check
off
was
impractical
because
designations
are
key
to
the
april
15
income
tax
date.
the
answer
to
that
is
found
in
our
brief.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
there
need
be.
you
could
have
a
check
off,
which
was
made
by
a
separate
form
immediately
after
the
nominating
conventions
for
example
or
something
of
that
nature
and
that
could
apply
for
all
the
four
years.
you
would
not
have
a
$1.00
check
off
every
year,
but
a
$4.00
check
off
say
immediately
after
the
conventions
and
election
years.
it
is
perfectly
practical
simple
system
which
would
avoid
all
this
business
of
congresses
deciding
who
gets
the
money
and
when
and
what
basis.
it
would
maybe
mean
that
the
government
was
acting
as
a
simple
conduit
for
money
that
went
from
the
taxpayers.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor.
we
definitely
have
a
first
amendment
argument
as
well
as
a
fifth
amendment
argument
here.
if
you
consider
for
example
your
decision
in
international
machinists
association
versus
street
where
you
held
that
it
violated
first
amendment
freedom
of
speech
for
a
labor
union
with
the
union-shop
contract
to
spend
members'
dues
to
support
political
candidacies
with
which
some
members
disagreed.
just
here,
tax
funding
is
used
to
pay
candidates
without
reference
to
which
candidates,
the
taxpayer
wishes
to
support.
appellees'
argument
that
the
check
off
is
voluntary
is
wholly
beside
the
point.
a
taxpayer
not
checking
off
does
not
have
his
taxes
reduced.
the
money
for
the
fund
comes
out
of
the
general
treasury
and
thus
is
involuntarily
contributed
by
all
taxpayers.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no
because
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no,
the
check
off
is
illusory
that
is
my
whole
point
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
it
is
just
like
a
general
appropriation.
it
is
just
like
the
appropriation
out
of
its
general
funds
that
the
labor
union
made
in
the
street
case
and
what
made
that
unconstitutional
was
that
money
was
being
used
to
support
some
and
not
all
political
speech,
without
regard
to
what
political
speech
the
people’s
money
it
was
wished
to
support.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor
and
the
street
decision
made
the
same
distinction.
it
said
we
are
not
saying
that
in
labor
union
cannot
dues
and
do
lots
of
things
with
which
individual
union
members
disagree.
the
one
thing
it
cannot
do,
you
held
was
to
subsidize
political
speech
with
which
some
members
disagreed
to
support
political
candidates
with
which
some
members
disagreed.
you
said
that
was
different.
that
posed
a
first
amendment
problem.
we
think
exactly
the
same
analysis
applies
here.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
not
at
all
justice
white.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no
sir.
this
was
dues
that
i
was
talking
about.
just
as
here
we
are
talking
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that
is
absolutely
correct,
just
as
here
the
collection
of
taxes
as
the
force
of
all
behind
it
and
the
check
off
is
academic
because
the
money
comes
out
of
the
general
treasury.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
the
people
who
have
not
checked
off,
have
not
consented
to
that
and
it
is
their
money
that
is
really
being
used,
that
is
my
point.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
he
has
consented.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
he
has
consented,
there
is
no
question.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that
is
correct.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
along
the
lines
i
have
indicated
if
it
resulted
still
in
the
money
being
paid
out
pursuant
to
an
allocation
by
a
congress,
we
would
still
have
at
least
the
discrimination
point
and
perhaps
more.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
one
final
word
on
this
credit
point
that
mr.
cutler
mentioned.
the
exemption
of
loans
from
the
contribution
definition
or
rather
from
the
contribution
limits
for
post
election
funding
applies
only
to
bank
loans
and
banks
are
not
going
to
lend
money
to
new
or
minor
political
parties
without
a
guarantee
and
the
contribution
limit
does
apply
to
the
guarantee.
therefore,
the
remedy
mr.
cutler
suggests
is
utterly
illusory.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
we
do
not
believe
there
can
be
a
non
discriminatory
system.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no
way,
but
this
certainly
is
not
is
one
that
comes
closest
to
it.
i
can
think
of
a
lot
less
discriminatory
ones
than
this.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir
and
one
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
indeed
and
one
reason
i
suggest
that
is
that
in
ripen
society
case,
the
dc
circuit
just
a
couple
of
weeks
after
it
decided
this
case,
said
that
this
very
public
financing
scheme
probably
turned
all
political
party
activities
in
to
state
action
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
--
for
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
purposes.
and
in
cousins
v.
wigoda
and
the
o’brien
versus
brown,
you
expressed
great
concern
that
political
parties
have
some
substantial
measure
of
control
over
their
own
affairs.
this
would
destroy
all
that.
that
is
one
of
the
several
reasons
why
do
we
believe
that
yes
it
is
per
se
unconstitutional.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir.
this
part
of
the
case
presents
the
questions
whether
congress
may
establish
to
administer
and
enforce
the
federal
action
law
with
the
complete
panoply
of
powers
appropriate
to
that
end.
an
agency
which
is
neither
part
of
the
executive
branch
nor
an
independent
agency,
but
rather
an
alter
ego
of
congress
itself
which
the
commission
has
conceded
to
be.
no
one,
i
think
denies
that
the
question
is
substantial
and
indeed
serious.
certainly
congress'
normal
function
in
our
constitutional
scheme
is
the
pass
laws,
not
to
administer
or
enforce
them.
it
is
urged
at
the
outset
that
these
questions
are
not
ripe
for
decision
and
that
we
have
no
standing
to
raise
them.
i
turn
then
first
to
rightness.
insofar
as
we
attack
the
method
of
appointment
of
the
commission,
it
is
right
to
exist
is
constituted.
we
are
talking
of
course
about
appointments
which
were
made
many
months
ago.
the
commission
is
so
appointed
as
in
full
operation.
everyday
it
is
taking
actions
which
have
vast
impact
on
the
political
process.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
not
at
all,
i
submit
justice
rehnquist.
the
appellants
are
all
members
of
the
class
which
have
a
right
to
seek
advisory
opinions.
as
political
candidates
and
parties
and
committees,
they
are
directly
impacted
by
the
commission’s
rules
and
regulations.
the
commission
has
done
things
that
effect
them
directly
and
which
harm
them.
just
two
or
three
examples,
as
challengers
which
most
of
these
appellants
are
and
as
parties
an
interest
supporting
challengers,
these
plaintiffs
are
drastically
injured,
not
by
what
the
commission
did
ironically
in
the
office
account
rule,
but
in
congress’
veto
of
that
rule
which
the
commission
passed.
the
commission
passed
the
rule
which
would
to
some
slight
modest
extent
had
mitigated
incumbent
advantages,
and
therefore,
benefited
the
appellants
and
congress
used
the
legislative
veto
on
it.
so
the
result
of
the
establishment
of
the
commission
as
a
legislative
agency
and
subject
to
the
legislative
veto
is
that
appellants
were
injured.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
they
were
injured
by
the
establishment
of
the
commission,
by
the
vesting
of
enforcement
and
interpretation
parallel
to
this
statute,
in
an
agency
which
could
not
insist
on
its
own
rule,
but
which
was
subject
to
congress'
legislative
veto.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
what
we
challenge
is
the
commission
as
a
legislative
agency.
it
is
made
in
legislative
agency
by
several
things,
but
essentially
by
two
things.
first,
the
appointment
powers,
second,
the
legislative
veto.
in
this
particular
instance
it
was
the
legislative
veto
that
was
the
more
conspicuous
element
of
legislative
control.
this
is
not
the
only
thing
the
commission
has
done
that
hurts
appellants.
the
advisory
opinion,
subjecting
lawyers
and
accountant’s
fees
to
the
expenditure
limits
which
came
down
about
ten
days
ago
i
believe
and
which
we
have
lodged
with
the
court,
was
as
the
two
dissenting
commissioners
said
terribly
hostile
to
the
interest
of
new
comers
and
challengers
to
the
political
scene,
who
have
greater
burdens
in
trying
to
figure
out
what
this
legislation
means
and
to
comply
with
it
than
incumbents
do.
this
advisory
opinion
expressly
injured
challengers
directly
in
that
sense.
senator
mccarthy,
the
commission
has
tried
to
audit
him.
they
have
threatened
him
with
the
use
of
their
civil
enforcement
power.
they
backed
off
a
bit
after
this
litigations
terminated
query
whether
they
will
continue
backing
off
on
that.
certainly
he
believes
that
he
is
directly
injured
by
attempts
to
audit
him
to
find
out
the
identity
of
his
contributors
down
as
low
as
$100.00
and
so
on.
the
disclosure
regulations
which
there
is
just
a
notice
so
far
and
they
have
not
been
formerly
adopted
yet,
the
great
burdensomeness
of
those
of
those
regulations,
what
a
number
of
observers
have
called
the
almost
incredible
complexity
and
the
new
conditions,
the
new
requirements
that
the
commission
is
planning
on
top
of
the
statutory
requirements.
for
example
keeping
photostats
of
every
check
which
there
is
nothing
about
in
the
statute.
these
similarly
impact
directly
on
appellant's
to
the
extent
that
they
have
to
file
reports
which
they
almost
all
of
them
do.
they
have
filed
them
and
they
injure
appellants
certainly
insofar
as
they
are
challengers
and
new
comers.
it
emerges
clearly
from
the
statutory
scheme
that
the
law
is
to
be
administered
and
enforced
primarily
by
the
commission
itself
through
a
whole
spectrum
of
powers.
statements
of
general
policy,
both
interpretative
and
substantive
rule
making,
advisory
opinions,
entertaining
complaints,
conducting
investigations
and
audits,
holding
hearings
on
complaints
and
undertaking
conciliation
procedures,
that
battery
of
powers
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
should
be
sufficient
to
compel
the
compliance
with
the
commission's
view
of
the
law.
resort
to
a
civil
enforcement
proceeding
or
they
are
brought
by
the
commission
itself
or
by
the
attorney
general
at
its
direction
should
rarely
be
necessary.
the
bulk
of
these
powers
have
already
been
exercised.
the
commission
has
made
rules.
it
has
issued
advisory
opinions.
it
is
administering
the
federal
subsidy
provisions,
certifications
and
what
not.
it
has
also
investigated
complaints,
and
conducted
audits
and
it
has
we
are
informed,
procured
compliance
with
its
views,
through
conciliations
proceedings
in
at
least
50
cases
so
far.
those
proceedings
are
secret,
so
they
are
not
announced
to
the
public,
but
were
told
there
have
been
at
least
50
of
it
that
have
been
brought
to
conclusion
so
far.
the
commission
is
even
exercised
the
power
of
which
the
commission’s
counsel
tells
you,
the
commission
does
possess,
that
is
the
power
to
issue
rules
governing
both
the
meaning
and
the
administration
of
the
expenditure
and
contribution
limits.
i
confess
to
a
lively
curiosity
as
to
what
precious
spritzer
is
going
to
tell
you
about
that.
but
as
to
all
the
powers
except
for
rule
making
and
bringing
enforcement
proceedings,
the
commission
and
its
counsel
are
in
agreement
that
they
apply
to
the
expenditure
and
contribution
limits
as
well
as
to
the
disclosure
provisions.
in
any
event,
congress
gave
the
commission
all
of
its
powers.
those
exercised
and
those
few
such
as
the
power
to
disqualify
a
candidate
which
are
yet
un-exercised
and
the
issue
here
is
the
facial
constitutionality
of
legislation
which
does
that
when
the
depository
of
power
is
an
arm
of
congress.
can
congress
validly
set
up
this
sort
of
agency
with
all
these
statutory
powers
by
this
method
of
appointment
and
subject
to
this
legislative
veto
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
separation
of
powers,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
that
is
a
standing
question
and
as
to
our
standing,
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
had
no
problem
with
it.
the
citizen
or
taxpayer
analogy
we
think
it
certainly
wrong.
i
have
mentioned
the
number
of
aspects
where
we
have
been
hurt
by
specific
things
that
the
commission
does,
but
even
beyond
that,
separation
of
powers
was
not
put
into
the
constitution
for
the
benefit
of
federal
office
holders.
it
was
put
there
to
avoid
tyranny
that
is
what
madison
said.
he
said
if
the
legislature
determines
the
powers
the
honors
and
the
emoluments
of
the
office,
we
should
be
insecure
if
they
were
to
designate
the
officer
also.
now,
we
think
this
case
is
just
like
glidden
company
versus
zdanok.
there,
the
litigant
was
held
to
have
standing
to
raise
the
article
three
question
because
the
court
held
that
the
article
3
provisions
were
put
in
there,
at
least
to
impart
for
the
benefit
of
litigants.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
we
think
the
commission
harms
this
by
existing
in
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
and
exercising
regulatory
control
over
us
which
it
is
doing
everyday.
we
have
had
to
file
reports
with
them.
we
are
subject
to
their
opinions.
we
are
subject
to
their
rules.
if
we
do
something
they
do
not
like
they
will
take
us
through
this
conciliation
proceedings
and
if
we
do
not
knuckle
under
them
then
they
will
take
this
to
the
court
or
have
someone
else
do
so.
now,
it
is
particularly
poignant
i
think
on
that
point
that
although
far
from
necessary
to
our
standing
that
appellants
represent
primarily
challengers
and
new
comers
to
the
political
process
and
we
say
that
by
having
these
laws
administered
by
a
legislative
agency,
congress
has
deliberately
retained
enormous
discretion,
power
and
control
over
the
enforcement
and
administration
of
these
statutes
which
turn
so
sharply
on
the
comparative
fairness
and
equity
as
between
challengers
on
the
one
hand
and
incumbents
on
the
other.
one
side
has
retained
the
power
not
only
to
set,
but
to
administer
and
enforce
the
rules
of
the
political
game.
as
challengers
are
newcomers,
we
think
we
have
to
have
standing
to
question
that
and
we
do
not
think
it
goes
anywhere
near
as
far
as
standing
in
great
many
of
your
cases.
as
to
the
merits,
once
the
commission
is
conceded
to
be
a
legislative
agency
which
can
do
nothing
that
congress
could
not
do
itself,
how
can
its
appointment
and
powers
and
the
legislative
veto
possibly
be
justified?
the
commission's
answer
is
that
there
is
something
special
about
political
campaigns
which
makes
regulation
of
them
different
from
every
other
subject
to
federal
law.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
who
appoints
the
membership
–
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
who
appoints
the
membership
plus
the
legislative
veto.
there
is
ancillary
things,
for
example,
the
oversight
of
budget
functions
which
congressman
hayes
has
so
vividly
said
is
going
to
be
used
of
the
hell,
but
that
is
some
to
some
extent
at
least
prove
any
further
plaintiff.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
and
all
six
are
confirmed
by
both
houses?
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
exactly.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
exactly.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
excuse
me?
either
house,
yes,
justice
rehnquist
either
house.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
we
think
it
would
then
be
an
executive
agency,
but
the
legislative
veto
would
be
bad.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
oh!
yes,
we
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
there
has
been
a
great
deal
written
about
that
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
am
sort
of
a
purest
about
it.
i
think
they
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
because
congress
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
the
president
cannot
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
could
not
require
what?
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that
is
correct.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
but
the
president
can,
the
president
is
entitled
to
participate
in
the
making
of
new
law.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
that
does
not
post
in
executive
legislative
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
--
problem
in
any
of
that,
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
justice
rehnquist,
the
legislative
veto
can
arise
in
a
great
number
of
different
contexts.
for
example,
in
the
executive
agreement
context
which
so
much
has
been
written
about,
there
it
is
a
question
of
whether
congress
is
unduly
intruding
into
the
foreign
affairs
power.
there
is
no
question
of
that
sort
here.
in
some
circumstances,
it
can
arise
when
congress
is
essentially
making
new
law,
or
passing
new
statutes
and
there
it
has
to
have
the
concurrence
of
the
president.
here
you
have
the
legislative
veto
added
to
the
appointment
mechanism
and
we
think
that
those
two
things
put
together,
clearly
make
this
commission
an
arm
of
congress,
a
legislative
agency.
now,
all
parties
are
agreed
as
to
that.
the
question
then
becomes,
can
a
legislative
agency,
can
an
arm
of
congress
perform
the
functions,
exercise
the
powers
which
congress
has
been
given
here?
could
congress
perform
these
functions
directly
and
if
not,
can
it
perform
them
through
its
controlled
agent?
in
other
words,
you
do
not,
to
resolve
this
case,
have
to
hold
that
the
legislative
veto
either
as
a
general
proposition
or
even
in
this
one
manifestation
is
itself
unconstitutional.
the
legislative
veto
comes
in
as
one
of
those
facts
of
life
which
make
the
commission
an
arm
of
congress
and
the
question
becomes
whether
the
power,
whether
an
arm
of
congress
can
do
this.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
they
are
executive
functions.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
but
it
cannot.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
alright,
the
advisory
opinion
on
attorneys'
and
accountants'
fees.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
it
could
have
done
it
by
regulation,
we
assume
it
will.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
it
will
all
depend
on
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
oh
yes!
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
they
asked
to
audit
senator
mccarthy’s
records.
senator
mccarthy
said,
“i
object!”
they
wrote
back
and
this
is
on
appendix
to
our
brief,
our
first
brief,
not
the
reply
brief.
they
wrote
back
a
letter
which
is
attached
there,
it
is
page
b
1
and
b
2,
the
very
last
page
of
our
first
brief,
in
which
they
send,
the
act
assigned
civil
jurisdiction
to
the
commission
of
all
apparent
violations
of
the
act
and
of
and
then
it
goes
and
lists
the
expenditure
and
contribution
limits
and
we
have
a
right
to
conduct
audits
and
so
forth
and
we
are
charged
to
correct
any
apparent
violations
by
informal
methods
of
conciliation
and
if
that
does
not
work,
we
can
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
to
enforce
compliance
with
criminal
statutes,
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
indeed,
i
am.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
indeed.
we
see
no
reason
why
congress
directly
or
through
an
agent
can
go
around
investigating
alleged
violations
of
the
election
law
any
more
than
the
account
of
the
thrust
law
for
purpose
and
enforcements.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
except
for
the
legislative
purposes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
and
that
is
--
yes
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
the
statutory
language
gives
the
commission
power
to
do
those
things,
some
of
which
it
is
done,
some
of
which
it
has
not
done.
we
think
that
it
is--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
we
think
the
former,
your
honor.
you
can
consider
not
only
those
powers
which
the
commission
has
exercised,
but
those
which
it
has.
it
has
exercise
most
of
them.
there
are
only
two
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
think
that
was
in
the
subsidy
section,
was
it
not?
we
think
that
all
you
need
is
the
statute.
all
you
need
is
the
statute,
the
powers
which
are
given
and
the
qualities
that
make
it
a
legislative
agency
all
are
plain
and
set
forth
in
the
statute.
the
only
reason
i
have
dwelt
to
any
extent
on
what
the
commission
has
done
is
that
rightness
in
standing
had
been
raised
as
issues.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
have
to
put
that
in
the
fourth
category
mr.
chief
justice
and
say
that
if
something
that
no
one
can
do,
whether
the
executive,
the
legislator
or
the
judiciary
and
i
think
powell
versus
mccormack
stands
for
that
proposition.
it
addressed
to
the
later
stage
of
the
stage
of
exclusion,
but
if
you
can
exclude
a
member
when
he
comes
for
the
house
with
the
qualifications
and
the
credentials
i
do
not
see
how
either
congress
or
anyone
else
could
strike
him
off
the
ballot.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no,
i
do
not
think
that
saves
it
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
power
which
the
constitutional
convention
is
quite
clear.
it
should
not
be
exercised
by
anyone.
all
the
comments
of
the
framers
which
are
set
out
at
such
great
length
in
powell
versus
mccormack
to
the
effect
that
it
must
be
the
people
who
chose
their
representatives
and
if
there
to
be
any
limitations
on
who
can
become
representatives,
it
must
be
the
constitution
itself
which
imposes
them
and
no
others,
no
others
can
sneak
in
there
in
any
way
whatsoever.
madison
and
hamilton
were
both
crystal
clear
about
that
and
it
is
all
set
forth
in
powell
versus
mccormack
and
we
think
it
follows
necessarily
from
that
that
the
disqualification
power
is
on
constitutional.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
there
is
no
question
that
the
house
of
course
can
exclude
him
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
--
after
he
is
elected.
the
question
then
becomes
whether
one
branch
and
if
so
which
one
could
anticipate
that
and
say
we
do
not
want
you
cluttering
up
the
ballot
when
you
are
sure
to
be
excluded
when
you
show
up.
i
have
not
--
i
cannot
say
--
i
thought
exhaustively
about
that
question.
but
the
answer
that
immediately
suggests
itself
for
me,
is
that
that
should
be
left
to
the
house
at
the
time
he
shows
up.
that
it
is
to
that
house
that
the
enforcement
of
those
constitutional
qualifications
have
been
given
and
for
anyone
else
to
take
him
off
the
ballot
would
be
to
make
someone
other
than
the
house,
the
judge
of
the
qualification
of
its
own
members.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
our
residential
requirement
is
one
of
the
constitutional
requirements
i
believe.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
the
state
can
certainly
keep
him
off
the
ballot,
and
i
assume
would
do
so.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
your
honor.
oh!
yes,
of
course
i
know
yes,
the
governor
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
think
in
pursuant
of
its
power
to
regulate
the
time,
place
and
manner
of
elections,
congress
could
certainly
set
up
some
mechanism
to
be
administered
by
someone
other
than
itself
to
make
sure
the
people
like
that
did
not
get
on
the
ballot.
there
is
no
question
that
the
power
--
that
the
federal
power
--
congressional
power
over
elections
is
very
broad,
but
it
is
a
legislative
power.
it
is
to
be
exercised
by
a
law
and
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
saying
that
the
congress
can
legislate
broadly
on
the
subject
on
one
hand
and
saying
that
it
can
retain
to
itself
the
enforcement
within
the
administration
power.
that
is
what
wrong
with
the
statute
and
the
disclosure
provisions
do
not
have
anything
to
do
in
our
submission
with
the
information
gathering
function
on
the
ground
that
they
are
justified
under.
appellees
themselves
and
mr.
friedman
this
morning
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
legislative
oversight
is
not
the
reason
for
the
disclosure
provisions.
the
reason
for
the
disclosure
provisions
are
first
to
inform
the
public
and
second
to
enforce
the
contribution
and
expenditure
limits
and
to
call
everything
that
the
commission
does
in
the
way
of
enforcing
the
disclosure
provisions,
mere
information
gathering
is
just
we
think
completely
spacious,
they
are
just
administering
those
as
just
as
bad
as
administering
the
expenditure
and
contribution
limits
directly.
