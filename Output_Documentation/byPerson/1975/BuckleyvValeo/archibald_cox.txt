mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
so
i
come
late
in
the
argument.
i
cannot
resist
saying
just
a
word
in
recognition
of
the
importance
and
weight
of
the
responsibility
that
rests
upon
this
court
in
this
case.
judging
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
even
when
there
are
few
are
issues,
less
complicated
issues
and
there
are
here,
is
always
a
solemn
occasion,
but
here
the
issues
are
of
even
greater
magnitude,
indeed
of
a
magnitude
greater
than
any
of
those
in
any
federal
legislation
i
can
think
of
in
several
decades,
except
perhaps
the
civil
rights
acts
of
the
1960’s
and
certainly
none
go
any
closer
to
the
heart
of
our
political
and
governmental
system.
the
attack
i
would
emphasize,
is
leveled
not
only
at
the
conclusions
of
the
congress
and
the
president
of
the
united
states,
but
in
substance
it
is
leveled
at
the
conclusions
of
a
majority
of
the
state
legislatures
and
we
must
take
it
that
much
of
this
represents
the
conclusions
of
their
people.
there
are
44
states
that
have
disclosure
statutes
in
one
form
or
another.
there
are
37
states
that
put
limits
on
expenditures,
many
of
them
going
back
a
number
of
decades
and
there
10
states
that
have
been
adopted
public
financing.
so,
that
in
addition
to
the
weight
of
the
judgment
of
the
congress
and
the
president
to
sign
the
legislation,
there
is
this
added
problem
of
the
state
legislature.
now
of
course
if
it
is
the
court's
responsibility
the
whole
the
act
unconstitutional,
it
will
do
it
as
this
court
always
has,
but
i
submit
that
those
are
considerations
that
should
be
weighed
in
the
balance.
my
argument
is
directed
to
the
proposition
that
ceilings
upon
contributions
and
expenditures
are
consistent
with
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
both
as
a
back
did
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
as
applied
to
any
situation
ripe
for
adjudication.
it
is
important
at
the
outset
to
be
clear
about
exactly
what
the
ceilings
on
contributions
and
expenditures
do
and
do
not
do.
the
act
deals
with
conduct,
the
giving
and
spending
of
money.
the
conduct
is
speech
related,
i
acknowledge
and
indeed
emphasize
because
money
buys
the
facilities
of
best
communications
and
leveraging
the
money
available
for
political
campaigns,
available
for
spending
may
of
course
to
some
degree
reduce
the
amount
that
is
spent
for
mass
communication.
but
even
so
the
conduct
to
speech
related,
i
emphasize
that
it
is
conduct
and
not
speech.
the
feca
does
not
prohibit,
punish
or
attached
liability
to
utterance,
communication
or
publication
except
in
the
very
limited
sense
that
in
the
case
of
expenditures
one
may
have
to
look
at
the
publication
to
see
whether
it
urges
the
election
or
defeat
of
candidates.
so,
it
will
be
evidence
as
to
purpose,
but
in
no
other
sense
--
mr.
archibald
cox
608
(e).
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
but
there
is
no
attempt
under
608
(e)
or
anywhere
else
to
censure
directly
or
indirectly
the
ideas
expressed
or
the
verbal
or
pictorial
form
communication.
equally
apart,
the
public
injuries
at
which
the
act
is
directed
are
the
consequences,
not
of
speech,
but
of
conduct.
congress
was
not
saying
that
there
is
too
much
speech.
the
dangerous
thoughts
were
being
expressed,
that
the
wrong
people
were
expressing
or
that
they
were
expressing
them
in
dangerous
ways.
congress
was
concerned
with
what
we
call
the
arms
race
political
expenditures.
with
the
pressure
to
raise
vast
financial
resources,
the
corrosive
influence
of
obligations
to
big
contributors
upon
the
conduct
of
government,
with
the
laws
of
public
confidence
in
the
honor
and
integrity
of
government
when
money
spent
plays
too
big
a
role.
and
with
the
political
inequalities
resulting
not
from
the
volume
of
speech,
but
from
the
need
to
raise
money
and
the
indebtedness
to
those
who
provide
big
money
and
i
think
those
two
characteristics
of
the
statute
fix
the
applicable
first
amendment
principles,
although
i
do
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
they
render
the
first
amendment
irrelevant.
when
the
governments
attempts
to
deal
with
speech
directly
then
a
case
for
regulations
has
to
be
made
wholly
or
in
partly
at
least
in
terms
of
the
danger,
the
danger
of
the
consequences
of
the
ideas.
mills
in
alabama’s
are
very
good
example.
the
alabama
statute
forbade
last
minute
newspaper
editorials
on
election
day.
the
only
conceivable
justification
was
that
the
ideas
expressed
would
have
somehow
have
too
much
impact
upon
the
public
and
it
was
quite
right
for
the
court
to
reply
as
it
did
in
that
case,
no
test
of
reasonableness
can
save
such
as
state
law.
the
reason
is
that
censorship
concerned
for
the
ideas
expressed
may
suppress
the
information
or
criticism
essential
to
self
government.
it
carries
danger
of
discrimination
among
ideas
or
speakers
and
there
is
sometimes
have
been
said,
it
carries
the
seeds
of
an
official
ideology.
and,
of
course
in
such
cases
there
is
little
or
perhaps
no
room
for
balancing
because
the
very
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
as
james
madison
said
“is
to
withhold
the
censorial
power
from
government
and
retain
it
in
the
people.”
the
cases
that
illustrate
this
proposition
are
the
case
of
the
pentagon
papers,
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
miami
herald
against
tornillo
and
the
red
lion
broadcasting
case.
i
want
to
make
clear
--
plain
that
we
are
not
quarreling
with
those
cases
and
we
have
no
need
to
invoke
any
of
them
in
our
support.
cases
like
the
present
which
involves
the
regulation
of
speech
related
conduct
because
of
the
public
injury
done
by
the
conduct,
quite
apart
from
the
speech
call
for
an
entirely
difference
step.
such
a
law
carries
few
with
any
of
peculiar
risk
of
censorship.
it
does
not
suppress
criticism,
ideas
or
information.
it
rests
no
discrimination.
it
carries
no
seeds
of
official
ideology.
balancing
in
such
cases
is
appropriate
and
has
often
been
sustained
by
the
court.
weinberger
and
hayes
is
an
admirable
example.
they
are
the
conduct,
a
duty
to
testify
was
of
grave
public
important
just
as
it
has
to
giving
evidence
by
all
of
us
is
grave
public
importance.
it
was
argued
that
regulating
the
conduct
imposing
that
duty
would
tend
to
chill
or
deter
of
the
flow
of
information
to
the
public.
both
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
the
principle
dissenting
opinion
as
i
read
them,
i
agreed
that
the
test
was
rather
the
consequential
effect
upon
the
flow
of
speech
was
justified
by
the
public
interest
served
by
imposing
the
duty
to
testify.
the
draft
card
burning
case,
united
state
against
the
o'brien
is
another
example.
after
observing
that
the
possession
of
the
draft
card
contributed
to
the
effective
administration
of
the
selective
service
laws,
the
court
observed
the
case
at
bar
is
therefore
unlike
one
where
the
alleged
governmental
interest
in
regulating
conduct
rises
in
some
measure
because
the
communication
itself
thought
to
be
harmful
and
the
court
will
recall
that
it
is
went
on
to
speak
of
the
need
for
balancing
and
to
hold
that
the
public
purposes,
if
compelling
or
paramount
were
sufficient
to
justify
the
purely
consequential
and
in
that
sense
coincidental
impact
upon
speech.
i
hold
this
part
so
important
that
i
want
to
take
one
last
example
to
elaborate.
the
appellants
and
the
solicitor
general
assert
that
limiting
the
money
spent
to
publish
a
newspaper
would
violet
first
amendment
and
they
are
like
in
this
case
to
the
case
of
the
newspaper.
i
submit
that
they
both
speak
too
indiscriminately.
a
limitation
on
the
publishers’
expenditures
would
violate
the
first
amendment
if
it
is
rested
upon
some
notion
that
the
columns
were
too
long,
the
editorials
were
to
frequent,
the
circulation
was
too
wide.
there
were
too
many
additions
or
something
of
that
kind,
but
consider.
during
the
war
time
shortage,
congress
certainly
could
limit
the
money
that
could
be
spent
to
buy
newsprint
even
though
the
consequence
was
to
reduce
the
circulation
of
the
paper
or
the
number
of
editions.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
yes,
but
we
say
this
statute
does
limit
even
handedly.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
to
agree
that
because
the
dangers
that
the
statute
is
directed
to
operate
in
the
area
of
political
campaigns,
the
only
speech
that
is
consequentially
effective
is
political
speech.
i
cannot
dispute
that.
i
would
simply
say
that
again
was
not
based
on
a
congressional
judgment
as
to
something
desirable
or
undesirable
about
political
speech
and
certainly
contained
no
kind
of
discrimination
between
different
political
ideas
or
parties
or
candidates.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
was
thinking
of
kind
in
terms
of
ideas
mr.
justice.
you
are
quite
right.
it
will
bear
of
course
on
the
least
personal
forms
of
speech.
well,
it
does
not
bear
on
an
individual's
personal
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we
have
the
same
idea.
i
may
have
misspoken
myself
and
i
think
that
does
in
a
very
real
sense
help
this
up.
but
i
would
say
that
this
kind
of
discrimination
justice
rehnquist
is
coincidental
or
consequential
and
it
is
not
the
sort
of
selectivity
or
undesirability
that
would
be
enough
to
make
a
different
test
applicable.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would.
i
would
agree
to
two
things
that
if
they
are
set
so
low
as
really
not
to
allow
any
use
of
the
mass
media
that
would
present
a
very
different
case
in
the
one
here.
i
would
agree
too
that
if
they
were
set
very,
very
low
they
might
then
discriminate
against
challengers
to
incumbents,
but
on
both
points
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
record
is
very
clear
that
that
it
is
not
the
consequence
of
the
statute.
in
terms
of
the
expenditure
ceilings
it
is
quite
clear
and
the
figures
are
all
in
our
brief,
that
the
ceilings
are
very
close
to
those
which
have
governed
in
political
campaigns
in
the
past.
for
example
in
1972
and
1974
lumping
the
whole
2000
candidates
for
the
house
together,
97%
spent
less
than
the
ceiling.
there
is
now
suggestion
that
there
was
inadequate
speech
in
those
97%
of
the
campaigns.
even
in
the
case
of
presidential
elections,
the
figure
is
very
close
to
the
average
amount
spent
by
the
two
candidates
in
1968.
it
is
a
little
bit
above
the
amount
--
a
little
bit
below
the
amount
spent
by
senator
mcgovern
in
1972.
it
is
way
below
the
amount
spent
by
his
opponent,
but
it
is
higher
than
we
spend
in
any
previous
campaign
so
that
we
say
that
it
is
closely
related
to
what
took
place
in
the
past.
that
one
has
to
conclude
that
congress
had
a
solid
basis
for
judging
that
this
would
not
seriously
curtail
the
volume
of
political
speech.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
speaking
of
overall
limits
on
expenditures.
mr.
archibald
cox
disclosure,
i
did
not
in
my
answer
have
that
in
mind.
i
do
not
think
the
limit
on
disclosure,
that
there
is
any
reason
to
suppose
that
will
affect
the
volume
of
speech
at
all,
not
just
like
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
constitutional
argument
is
stronger
in
a
case
of
requiring
the
disclosure
--
mr.
archibald
cox
because
there
is
more
danger
of
the
million
dollar
contribution
being
corrupted
and
there
is
more
reason
for
the
public
to
wish
to
know
who
is
giving
a
million
dollars
to
a
political
campaign.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
greater
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
the
change
in
balance,
if
any,
is
on
the
justification,
not
on
the
invasion.
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
there
is
very
little
--
there
is
no
showing
of
any
deterrent
effect
that
disclosure.
these
laws
have
been
on
the
books
for
a
very
long
time.
of
course
if
one
could
contribute,
especially
if
it
is
a
group
of
corporate
executives
that
are
contributing
they
rather
contribute
before
the
disclosure
law
becomes
effective
than
after
as
one
of
the
justices
find
it
out,
that
does
not
show
they
would
not
contribute
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
speaking
justice
powell
in
terms
of
the
general
impact
and
i
will
agree
that
you
can
think
of
cases
were
the
only
way
in
which
a
man
could
win
was
by
having
to
spend
enormous
sums
of
money
himself
because
everything
else
was
staked
against
him
and
i
was
thinking
of
the
generality,
i
got
into
it
by
attempting
to
grab
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question,
that
if
the
overall
limit
on
spending
were
very,
very
low
than
the
man
who
has
recognition
to
begin
with,
of
course,
would
have
an
advantage.
the
point
i
was
seeking
to
make
was
that
the
ceilings
here
are
not
that
low
and
i
think
that
again
is
shown
by
experience
and
of
course
the
burden
of
showing
is
not
those
defending
the
statute,
it
is
on
those
attacking.
but
if
you
look
at
the
ceilings,
on
the
basis
of
the
1974
election,
it
seems
that
they
give
ample
chance
to
challengers
to
gain
recognition.
and
second
that
taking
the
act
as
a
whole,
they
hurt
incumbents
who
probably
have
the
greater
money
raising
capacity
more
than
challengers.
let
me
give
just
a
few
things.
i
pointed
out
a
moment
before
that
only
3%
of
all
the
candidates
in
house
races,
it
is
little
less
than
3%
exceeded
the
ceilings
in
1972,
1974
even
after
1972
was
adjusted
for
inflation.
of
the
forty
successful
challengers
in
1974,
only
one
exceeded
the
ceilings.
of
the
28
challenger
winners
in
close
races,
that
is
where
the
winner
got
less
than
55%
of
the
vote,
the
average
spent
was
only
$95,000.00
out
of
an
overall
ceiling
of
a
$168,000.00
for
the
combined
primary
and
general
election.
of
the
candidates
in
close
races
in
both
primary
and
general
election,
in
1974,
only
459
exceeded
the
combined
ceiling.
so,
there
really
is
very
little
ground
for
arguing,
that
these
ceiling
which
really
check
the
sky
rocketing
increase
rather
than
cut
anything
very
much
back,
particularly
in
the
congressional
races
do
not
allow
adequate
opportunity
to
become
known
and
i
can
find
no
basis
for
arguing
that
on
the
whole
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
they
fail,
they
discriminate
against
challengers.
i
think
if
they
do
anything
they
hurt
incumbents
more
than
challenger.
mr.
archibald
cox
did
congress
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
am
not
able
to
say
that
it
did,
i
think
one
most
assume
that
many
members
of
the
staff
and
others
did
study
these
things
and
i
am
informed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
perhaps
i
have
a
moment
after
lunch
in
which
i
could
answer
your
question
justice
blackmun.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
yes,
after
considerable
discussion.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
these
were
men
who
had
run
in
many,
many
races,
sometimes
most
recently
as
winners,
but
i
have
no
doubt
many
of
them
sometimes
disclose.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
all
435
favor
incumbents
entirely.
i
recognize
the
point.
i
recognize
too
that
this
is
a
first
amendment
case
and
that
the
judgment
perhaps
requires
somewhat
closest
scrutiny,
but
i
would
think
that
the
court
should
simply
act
as
a
legislative
body,
i
have
--
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct
and
indeed
i
think
the
history
shows
much
either
way.
it
is
shows
that
the
incumbents
are
hurt
more
because
they
nearly
always
spend
more
both
when
there
successful
and
unsuccessful
and
this
we
draw
from
the
figures
on
the
close
races.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
recognize
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
no
question
that
the
incumbents
have
advantages
sometimes
the
disadvantages,
but
they
are
likely
through
name
recognition
to
be
advantages.
my
proposition
is
that
this
statute
does
not
make
challengers
any
worse
off
in
that
respect
than
they
were
before.
now,
some
have
mellifluous
voices
and
others
do
not.
they
are
all
kinds
of
injustices
in
the
world.
i
say
this
statute
does
not
make
it
any
worse
and
we
developed
that
in
some
length
in
our
brief.
i
would
add
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
most
that
is
contended,
is
that
on
the
average
as
i
understand
it
because
the
word
generally
is
included
in
the
heading
in
the
brief
that
on
the
average
they
contend
statistically
somewhat
more
incumbents
may
benefit
and
challengers
be
hurt
than
the
other
way
around.
but
one
does
not
make
a
case
of
unconstitutional
discrimination
by
that
kind
of
statistical
average.
furthermore,
all
it
seems
to
me
say
is
that
challengers
gain
more
from
the
pernicious
practices
and
incumbents
and
we
would
say
that
the
pernicious
practices
are
the
evils,
congress
were
meeting
or
was
meeting
are
such
that
they
justifies
certainly
any
chance
differentiation
between
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
certainly
say
that
--
yes
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
had
to
confess
to
justice
brennan
my
ignorance
on
one
point,
but
is
now
been
relieved
mr.
justice.
an
analysis
of
the
relationship
between
possible
spending
ceilings
and
past
experience
based,
of
course,
on
72
rather
than
74
because
74
had
not
happened,
it
was
submitted
to
the
congressional
committees
chiefly
by
common
cause
and
it
was
essentially
the
same
kind
of
analysis
that
i
made.
if
you
care
for
the
references,
you
will
find
it
in
the
hearings
on
h-7612,
93rd
congress,
first
session
which
was
in
october
and
november
1973,
and
similarly
on
hearings
on
s-1103
at
the
same
congress
and
the
same
session.
at
that
time,
i
may
say,
and
then
i
would
like
to
go
on,
the
common
cause
representatives
were
arguing
that
care
must
be
taken
not
to
set
the
ceilings
too
low
and
the
quotations
that
my
friend
has
referred
to,
complaining
that
if
the
ceiling
was
too
low,
it
would
discriminate
against
challenges.
it
was
during
a
time
when
much
lower
ceilings
were
being
discussed
than
appear
in
the
statute.
now,
i
would
like,
during
the
moments
remaining
to
me,
to
address
myself
to
section
608
(e)
of
the
statute
which
has
been
mentioned
several
times
this
morning,
that
is
the
section
which
deals
with
the
so
called
independent
expenditures.
if
an
expenditure,
a
spending
of
money
in
the
loose
sense,
is
requested
by
a
candidate
or
his
committee
or
is
otherwise
made
with
his
authority,
then
it
is
a
contribution
and
counts
against
this
overall
ceilings.
if
the
spending
is
done
without
any
kind
of
authority
from
the
candidate
than
it
falls
under
section
608
(e)
and
if
it
exceeds
$1,000.00,
it
would
be
unlawful.
to
put
the
discussion
of
that
section
in
context,
may
i
first
recall
portions
that
i
will
have
to
leave
to
my
brief,
having
stated
as
we
did,
the
applicable
constitutional
principle
this
morning,
then
of
course
a
complete
exposition
would
call
first
three
showings
i
did
seek
to
show
that
adequate
opportunities
were
to
remain.
second,
that
the
purposes
of
this
legislation
where
indeed
compelling,
the
purposes
as
we
see
them
are
first,
to
protect
the
honor
and
integrity
of
government
operations
in
both
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
against
the
corrosive
influence
of
large
contributions,
the
pressure
to
raise
large
money
and
the
resulting
sense
of
indebtedness
which
of
course
does
not
affect
every
contribution,
but
there
appear
to
have
been
too
many
of
that
character.
its
concern
with
the
public’s
confidence
in
its
government
against
the
appearance
of
things
when
government
favors,
follow
such
large
contributions
and
its
concern
with
giving
the
small
donor
an
equal
voice
with
the
large
donor,
not
in
speaking,
but
in
opportunity
to
reach
that
candidate,
the
large
donor
money.
now,
we
say
that
section
608
(e),
the
limit
on
independent
expenditures
is
essential
to
the
effectuation
of
those
purposes.
very
briefly,
if
there
were
no
such
provision
in
the
statute,
then
instead
of
making
a
contribution
of
5,
10
or
$50,000.00,
someone
would
just
spend
it,
take
over
all
a
candidate’s
advertising
in
lawrence,
massachusetts
or
take
over
the
broadcasting
of
film
clips
of
his
previous
speeches
or
his
television
spot
and
surely
in
this
aspect
of
608
(e),
it
is
essentially
like
a
contribution,
it
is
money
that
a
person
who
spends
it
is
putting
out.
he
is
not
putting
out
his
own
words
or
his
own
ideas.
he
is
not
engaged
in
personal
activity.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
ad
and
of
course
that
is
not
in
support
of
a
candidate,
we
both
understand
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
would
not
be
affected
at
all.
it
would
depend
how
much
the
individuals
contributed
to
its
composition,
quite
practically.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
under
the
first
amendment
of
course.
i
do
not
say
anything.
i
would
it
was
entitled
to
less
protection
than
it
is
when
you
yourself
compose
the
ad
or
make
the
speech.
i
have
a
lesser
role
if
i
used
to
have
a
lesser
role
when
i
signed
the
brief
as
solicitor
general
that
mr.
spritzer
had
written
then
when
i
wrote
a
brief
myself
and
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
something
of
a
lining.
now,
i
am
not
making
anything
turn
on
that
except
by
assertion
that
in
the
case
where
the
individual
has
no
personal
participation,
it
is
just
like
a
contribution,
then
i
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
these
cases
shade
indistinguishably
one
into
another
and
i
cannot
draw
an
intelligible
line.
indeed,
my
essential
proposition
is
that
an
intelligible
line
cannot
be
drawn
and
that
the
reason
congress
included
608
(e)
as
it
did,
was
that
it
decided
that
the
most
sensible
line
was
between
personal
participation
in
campaigning
or
in
speaking,
in
doing
things
yourselves
in
personal
services
and
spending
money
and
it
drew
the
line
there
because
there
was
no
other
very
satisfactory
way
of
doing
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
well,
i
think
where
it
is
truly
personal
services,
that
is
distinguishable
from
spending
money.
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
make
something
turn
between
truly
personal
services
in
speaking
and
putting
up
money.
i
agree
that
they
shade
one
into
the
other
and
that
the
question
is
where
is
the
most
satisfactory
place
to
draw
a
line
and
i
suggest
that
the
most
satisfactory
place
to
draw
the
line
which
congress
considered
very
carefully
was
between
allowing
people
to
do
things
themselves
and
allowing,
and
seeking
to
spend
more
than
$1,000.00,
also
really
more
than
$1,500.00
because
you
get
$500.00
in
incidental
expenses
if
you
do
it
yourself
and
i
am
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
the
most
daily
claim.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
the
clearest
[laughter]
i
would
make
--
i
would
make
if
i
may
just
two
further
sentences.
first,
i
would
say
that
in
fact
individuals
do
not,
just
a
matter
of
observation,
spend
large
sums
of
money,
broadcasting
their
own
speeches,
putting
their
own
writings
in
newspapers
and
second,
the
reason
i
emphasize
my
agreement
with
the
proposition
that
the
line
can
hardly
be
drawn
between
personal
involvement
in
a
paid
advertisement
that
no
real
personal
involvement
in
the
paid
advertisement,
the
reason
i
stress
that
is
that
they
chose
the
importance
of
section
608
(e)
to
the
whole
plan,
that
this
would
be
as
the
court
below
recognize
an
exceedingly
serious
loophole.
i
do
not
think
it
would
render
the
whole
plan
inoperable,
but
it
would
be
an
exceedingly
serious
loophole
which
would
raise
the
whole
pressure
over
again,
but
i
express
just
one
last
thought
on
this
point
mr.
chief
justice.
i
point
out
that
there
is
no
plaintiff
here
who
alleges
that
he
or
she
desires
to
spend
money
publicizing
his
or
her
own
speech
and
that
this
most
extreme
application
of
608
(e)
might
well
be
treated
as
hypothetical,
not
properly
before
the
court
and
the
argument
of
overbreadth
could
and
i
think
should
be
rejected
on
the
ground
that
through
most
of
its
application,
section
608
(e)
is
like
the
restriction
on
contributions,
and
that
therefore,
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth
does
not
apply
and
the
particular
cases
can
be
dealt
with
if
and
when
they
ever
arise.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
to
say
any
citizen
may
ask
the
federal
elections
commission
for
a
ruling
on
that
part
and
will
be
protected
in
following
the
ruling.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
not
think
that
the
commission
has
and
it
would
any
occasion
to
answer
that
question.
the
question
that
would
be
put
to
it
would
be
whether
the
speech
with
sufficient
clarity
identified
a
candidate
and
whether
it
urged
nomination
or
election
that
i
suppose
in
this
sense,
if
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
as
section
591
(b)
on
page
37
of
the
statute,
defines
a
candidate
is
an
individual
who
seeks
nomination
for
election
and
so
forth.
so
it
involves
some
seeking
on
the
part
of
the
person.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
there
is
a
question,
what
seeking
means
and
i
am
not
aware
of
that
interpretation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
know
nothing
beyond
the
statue
on
this
point.
if
i
would
take
it
that
someone
who
is
disclaiming
concerned
who
says
they
would
not
accept
the
nomination
is
not
a
candidate
whatever
the
newspaper
say.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
confess
that
i
do
not
recall
the
facts
of
1916
election
well
enough
to
say
that.[laughter]
i
would
--
1924,
i
can
speak
to
when
calvin
collin
said,
“i
do
not
choose
to
run,”
i
suppose
he
was
not
seeking
the
nomination,
although
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
do
not
deny
that
cases
could
be
put
that
are
close
to
line
on
this
point
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
statute
that
could
possibly
avoid
that
question.
the
same
problem
has
come
up
in
deciding
whose
names
must
go
on
primaries
and
election
list.
i
just
have
to
imagine
that
anyone
seriously
risking
prosecution
under
608
(e)
because
of
they
are
writing
a
letter,
urging
that
so
and
so
who
is
not
yet
a
candidate
ought
to
run
or
something
like
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
a
certain
--
i
am
referred
and
i
do
not
want
to
take
the
court’s
time
to
be
enlightened
on
my
ignorance
for
which
i
apologize,
i
think
if
you
will
read
591
(b)
and
with
care,
you
will
find
that
it
throws
more
light
than
i
have
been
able
to
give
on
this
question.
i
am
sorry
to
espouse.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you
would
have
no
statutory
right
to
it.
i
am
not
sure
if
the
commission
will
refuse
it.
