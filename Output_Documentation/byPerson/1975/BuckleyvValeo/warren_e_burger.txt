we
will
hear
arguments
today
in

against
valeo
and
the
others.
counsel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief

but
it
would
make
a
difference
i
suppose
if
some
candidate
was
thinking
about
it
and
with
one
course
of
action
he
might
be
subject
to
a
criminal
charge
or
other
sanctions
and
with
the
other
course
of
action
he
would
be
in
clear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gora.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
relate
that
to
the
amounts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
your
argument
mr.
gora,
to
be
that
there
is
no
valid
rational
public
interest
in
flushing
out
in
publicizing
the
names
of
$100.00
contributors
or
$101.00
contributors,
none
that
can
be
justified
constitutionally,
but
that
there
is
indeed
a
real
public
interest
in
knowing
about
$10,000.00
or
a
$100,000.00
or
$500,000.00,
is
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
cannot
pick
the
point
where
the
line
should
be
drawn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
must
mean
in
there
that
the
public
interest
in
knowing
about
the
large
one
is
that
$10,000.00
or
$100,000.00
or
$500,000.00
might
conceivably
buy
something
improperly,
but
that
$100.00
or
$125.00
could
not
conceivably
buy
anything
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
these
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
buy
much
radio
time;
it
does
not
buy
much
newspaper
space
and
certainly
not
much
influence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
gora.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three
quarters
of
the
century
of
study
of
this
problem
by
the
congress,
you
suggested
that
was
sustained
study
or
sporadic
study?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
analyze
that
a
little
bit?
you
made
this
a
very
broad
general
statement.
would
you
see
any
corrupt
or
improper
motive
if
a
very
wealthy
man
said
that
he
would
put
up
a
half
million
dollars
or
a
million,
whatever
it
takes
for
a
series
of
three
national
television
debates
between
two
candidates
or
within
a
state
if
it
is
senatorial
race.
now,
he
is
contributing
to
both
sides,
is
he
not,
when
he
finances
that?
anything
improper
in
that?
could
that
be
explained
by
a
dedication
to
the
first
amendment
idea
that
the
issues
should
be
debated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
another
occasion
and
the
situation
you
hypothesized
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
a
man
giving
$10,000.00
to
each
of
the
two
major
party
candidates
perhaps
just
wants
to
make
sure
that
one
of
two
men
that
he
regards
as
responsible
will
be
elected
and
the
third
party
candidate
will
not
be
elected.
those
are
all
valid
motivations,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
took
the
argument
of
your
friends
to
mean
that,
yes,
indeed
there
is
a
public
interest
in
limiting
expenditures,
but
that
when
balanced
against
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
small
contributor,
the
first
amendment
rights
shall
prevail
over
$100.00
limit.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
limit
of
it,
the
limit
that
you
can
give
out
having
his
name
flushed
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
experts
on
this
these
subject,
i
suppose
some
people
will
have
to
act
at
their
peril
in
deciding
what
to
do
without
being
sure
whether
they
will
or
not
go
to
the
jail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
does
not
ask
for
the
opinion
and
simply
gets
the
opinion
of
his
own
lawyer
one
way
and
that
turns
off
to
be
wrong,
he
has
got
problems
i
suppose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cox
would
not
the
limits
that
is
the
disclosure
limits,
the
$100.00
limit,
the
$1,000.00,
the
expenditure
limit
could
not
they
be
so
low
or
if
they
were
cast
so
low,
do
you
agree
that
they
might
then
impinge
on
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
your
answer
give
some
weight
to
the
incumbents
on
a
lot
of
ability
and
assets
that
challenger
do
not
have,
namely
large
office
staffs
and
branch
offices
out
in
the
district
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
news,
news
worthiness
to
what
they
do
that
the
challengers
do
not
always
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.

well
then
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
were
the
whole
area
is
foggy
than
the
land
drawing
should
be
left
to
the
congress?
chief

at
1
o’clock.

mr.

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.

were
you
suggesting
in
polite
way
that
this
was
cosmetic
legislation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clagett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
this
party
of
the
kind
you
have
just
described
is
waging
an
issue
campaign
without
any
real
hope
through
electing
its

necessarily?
chief

mr.

chief

warren
e.

mr.
cutler,
refresh
my
memory
if
you
can
on
the
largest
percentage
of
vote
that
any
third
party
has
ever
received
in
our
history?
chief

warren
e.

well
third,
went
after
the
first
two
in
any
particular
election?[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
next
nearest
to
mr.
theodore
roosevelt
support
the
senator
lafollette
back
in
the
20’s?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cutler,
if
the
first
amendment
violation
is
found
to
exist,
determined
to
exist,
does
it
make
any
difference
then
whether
it
operates
against
small
and
new
parties
or
for
them
or
against
or
for
the
major
parties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
cutler.
(inaudible)
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
of
those
problems
would
have
been
resolved,
would
they
not
largely,
if
not
all,
if
the
check
off
had
been
to
add
a
dollar
to
the
taxpayer’s
bill
and
then
give
that
money
to
this
general
fund?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
clagett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
now
proceed
to
your
argument
chief
and
then
on
the
third
point
mr.
clagett?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying
the
enforcement
proceeding
function
is
exclusively
an
executive
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
classify
the
power
to
strike
the
candidate
from
the
ballot
in
which
of
the
three
categories,
say
that
falls?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
do
not
think
that
judicial
review
saves
it
any,
the
initial
power
of
arrest
with
the
commission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
about
a
candidate
who
demonstratively
not
eligible
to
be
a
candidate?
this
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
for
an
office
which
requires
that.
you
say
no
branch
of
the
government
will
have
any
power
to
take
him
of
the
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
he
is
elected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
would
be
like
the
candidates
who
were
refused
to
their
seats
because
they
held
commission
as
generals
or
in
one
case
they
held
the
commission
as
the
united
states
attorney
with
the
same
kind
of
mechanism?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
answer
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
answer
to
that
is
the
absence
of
the
veto
power
also,
i
thought
it
coupled
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
not
this
commission
undertaken
to
do
or
something
to
senator
mccarthy
already?
it
made
demands
on
him
of
some
kind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
only
the
question
that
senator
mccarthy
could
raise,
just
the
power
of
the
commission
to
ask
him
some
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
per
curiam
opinion
and
judgment
to
announce
on
behalf
of
the
court
in
buckley
against
valeo,
75-436
and
75-437.
the
question
before
the
court
in
these
cases
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act
of
1971
as
amended
in
1974.
the
federal
election
campaign
act
governs
financial
aspects
of
campaigns
for
federal
offices.
it
limits
contribution
to
candidates
and
committees.
it
limits
expenditures
relative
to
a
clearly
identified
candidate.
it
limits
expenditures
by
a
candidate
from
his
personal
or
family
funds.
it
restricts
overall
general
election
and
primary
campaign
expenditures.
it
requires
political
committees
to
keep
detailed
records
of
contributions
and
expenditures
including
the
names
and
addresses
of
each
individual
contributor
in
excess
of
$10
and
the
name,
address,
occupation
and
principal
place
of
business
of
all
contributors
contributing
in
excessive
$100.
political
committees
must
file
quarterly
reports
with
the
federal
election
commission,
disclosing
the
source
of
every
contribution
exceeding
$100
and
the
recipient
and
purpose
of
every
expenditure
in
excess
of
$100.
every
individual
or
group
other
than
a
candidate
or
political
committee
making
contributions
or
expenditures
in
excess
of
$100,
other
than
by
contribution
to
a
political
committee
or
candidate
must
file
a
statement
with
the
commission.
the
act
creates
an
eight-member
commission
with
record
keeping,
disclosure
and
investigatory
functions
and
with
rule
making,
adjudicatory,
and
enforcement
powers.
the
commission
consists
of
two
members
appointed
by
the
president
pro
tempore
of
the
senate,
two
by
the
speaker
of
the
house,
and
two
by
the
president
of
the
united
states,
all
subject
to
confirmation
by
both
houses
of
the
congress.
the
secretary
of
the
senate
and
the
clerk
of
the
house
are
ex
officio
nonvoting
members
of
the
commission.
subtitle
h
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
amended
in
1974,
provides
for
public
financing
of
presidential
nominating
conventions
and
general
elections
and
primary
campaigns
from
a
fund
created
by
an
optional
checkoff
system
under
which
each
tax
payer
may
on
filing
his
or
her
tax
return,
indicate
approval
of
placing
$1
of
general
tax
revenue
into
the
fund
for
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
resulting
amount
is
allocated
for
the

in

and
their

are
entitled
to
funding
for
nominating
conventions
and
general
election
campaigns.
minor
parties
and

receive
a
percentage

receive

primary

by

who
receives
more
than
$5,000
from
private
sources,
counting
only
the
first
$250
of
each
contribution,
in
each
of
20
states,
is
eligible
for
matching
public
funds.
the
appellants
in
these
cases
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
these
statutory
provisions
on
various
constitutional
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
certified
questions
from
the
district
court,
sustained
in
all
but
one
of
the
statutory
provisions.
the
three-judge
district
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
subtitle
h.
i
am
authorized
to
announce
on
behalf
of
the
court
the
following
judgment.
the
court
holds
that
this
litigation
presents
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy
since
the
complaint
discloses
that
at
least
some
of
the
appellants
have
a
sufficient
personal
stake
in
the
determination
of
the
constitutional
validity
of
each
of
the
challenge
provisions,
specifically
now
as
to
the
contribution
and
expenditure
limitations.
the
court
holds
that
the
act's
contribution
provisions
are
constitutional
as
appropriate
legislative
measures
to
deal
with
the
reality
and
appearance
of
improper
influence
stemming
from
the
dependence
of
candidates
on
large
campaign
contributions.
the
court
holds
that
the
contribution
limits
do
not
directly
impinge
upon
the
rights
of
individual
citizens
and
candidates
to
engage
in
political
debate
and
discussion.
the
court
holds
that
the
expenditure
provisions,
the
expenditure
limitations
are
violative
of
first
amendment
guarantees
and
they
are
unconstitutional.
those
provisions
place
substantial
and
direct
restrictions
on
the
ability
of
candidates,
of
citizens,
and
associations
to
engage
in
political
expression
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
as
to
the
disclosure
provisions,
the
court
holds
as
follows.
the
act's
disclosure
and
record
keeping
provisions
are
a
constitutional
exercise
of
legislative
power.
they
serve
substantial
governmental
and
public
interests.
it
was
reasonable
for
the
congress
to
conclude
that
disclosure
of
contributions
informs
the
public
and
serves
a
legitimate
governmental
and
public
interest
in
relation
to
the
political
processes.
the
disclosure
provisions
challenged
in
this
case
are
not
overbroad
insofar
as
they
apply
to
contributions
to
minor
parties
and
independent
candidates.
congress,
the
court
holds,
could
appropriately
conclude
that
a
blanket
exemption
for
minor
parties
was
not
warranted.
minor
parties,
however,
will
be
free
to
show
the
reasonable
probability
that
the
compelled
disclosure
required
by
the
act
as
to
contributors'
names
will
subject
them
to
threats
or
harassment
as
a
result
of
such
disclosure.
as
narrowly
construed
by
the
court’s
holding
today,
the
act's
provisions
for
disclosure
by
those
who
make
independent
contributions
and
expenditures
is
also
held
constitutional.
in
construing
the
provision,
the
court
limits
it's
application
to
narrow
and
precise
circumstances,
when
contributions
are
either
earmarked
for
political
purposes
or
have
been
authorized
or
requested
by
a
candidate
or
by
his
agent
to
be
made
to
some
person
other
than
a
candidate
or
a
political
committee
and
when
expenditures
are
made
for
a
communication
that
expressly
advocates
the
election
or
defeat
of
a
clearly
identified
candidate.
as
construed,
this
provision
is
not
unconstitutionally
vague
nor
does
it
not
constitute
an
unlawful
prior
restraint.
the
court
holds
that
the
particular
dollar
thresholds,
selected
by
the
congress
are
related
to
the
goals
of
the
act
and
constitute
line
drawing
of
a
kind
that
is
within
legislative
power.
application
of
the
record
keeping
and
disclosure
requirements
to
contributions
of
$10
and
$100
is
held
not
overbroad
on
this
record.
as
to
public
financing
provisions,
the
court
holds
subtitle
h
of
the
internal
revenue
code
constitutional
because
congress
under
the
general
welfare
clause
has
power
to
decide
what
expenditures
will
promote
the
general
welfare.
subtitle
h
is
held
a
permissible
congressional
choice
as
a
means
to
reform
the
electoral
processes.
the
court
holds
also
that
the
subtitle,
subtitle
h
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
rather
it
represents
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
use
public
money
to
facilitate
and
enlarge
the
public
discussion
and
participation
in
the
electoral
processes.
being
less
burdensome
than
ballot
access
regulations
and
having
been
enacted
in
furtherance
of
governmental
and
public
interests
considered
vital,
subtitle
h
does
not
invidiously
discriminate
against
minor
and
new
parties
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
finally,
the
court’s
invalidation
of
the
spending
limit
provisions
of
the
act
does
not
render
subtitle
h
unconstitutional.
that
subtitle
is
severable
from
those
provisions.
as
to
the
federal
election
commission,
the
court
holds
that
the
commission's
composition
as
to
all,
but
it's
investigatory
and
informative
powers,
violates
article
ii,
section
2,
clause
2
of
the
constitution
to
the
extent
that
a
majority
of
the
voting
members
of
the
commission
are
appointed
by
the
president
pro
tempore
of
the
senate
and
the
speaker
of
the
house.
therefore,
although
the
commission's
past
acts
are
by
the
court’s
holding
accorded
de
facto
validity
and
a
stay
is
granted,
permitting
the
