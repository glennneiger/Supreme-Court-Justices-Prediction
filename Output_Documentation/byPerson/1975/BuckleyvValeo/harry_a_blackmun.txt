justice
harry
a.
blackmun
which
is
to
say
the
definition
of
years
in
relation
to
the
election
not
as
an
account?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
it?
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
limits
would
apply?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
we
have
some
more
time.
following
to
what
justice
stewart
indicated,
it
seems
to
me
in
a
distinct
sense
that
one
of
your
problems
is
to
joist
with
this
suggestion
that
money
is
speech
and
i
think
part
of
the
argument
of
your
opponents
is
very
forceful
in
that
respect.
it
does
produce
speech.
now;
all
of
us
of
course
recognize
that
there
is
a
profound
and
disturbing
problem
that
has
existed.
i
suppose
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
and
does
the
statute
do
it
effectively
without
unduly
violating
the
first
amendment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
i
think
it
is
unnecessary
really
for
your
side
of
the
case
to
impress
upon
this
court
that
there
is
a
problem.
i
think
we
are
aware
of
this
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cox
that
the
legislative
history
show
that
the
kind
of
analysis
you
just
given
us?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
congress
make
the
kind
of
analysis
in
fixing
these
limits
that
you
just
been
suggesting?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
just
wondered
whether
the
legislative
history
reveal
that
kind
of
analysis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
gather
mr.
cox
that
advisory
opinions
are
not
available
to
any
citizen,
only
to
candidates
and
protocol
committees,
are
they
not?
i
cannot
go
to
the
federal
election
commission
and
ask
them,
if
john
jones
has
risen
to
candidate?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
other
side
of
that
coin
of
course
is
that
governor
wallace
did
a
lot
of
noise
and
was
heard
four
years
before?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
go
so
far
as
to
a
residential
requirement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
do
you
think
anyone
that
no
branch
of
government
have
government
could
enforce
that
except
the
house
itself
to
which
the
person
is
elected?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
succeeded
in
doing
so
in
one
of
the
carolina
last
time,
did
it
not?
