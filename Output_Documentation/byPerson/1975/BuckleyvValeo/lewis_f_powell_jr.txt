justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
the
penalty
for
failure
to
comply?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
for
a
citizen
who
fails
to
report
a
hundred
dollar
contribution?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
going
to
leave
the
hypothetical
that
you
just
put?
if
you
are,
i
beg
to
leave
it.
i
would
like
to
ask
this
question.
as
i
understand
it
that
cooperation
and
unions
are
exempted
from
the
spending
and
contribution
requirements
of
this
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
is
any
limitation
on
that
fund?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
right,
the
union
and
the
cooperation
as
the
case
maybe
has
the
authority
on
the
610
to
organize
that
fund
and
they
solicit
the
money
for
the
fund
from
stockholders,
employees
and
union
members.
now,
you
are
talking
about
the
corrosive
or
corroding
effect
of
large
concentrations
of
wealth.
how
do
you
explain
the
exception
of
cooperations
and
unions
from
this
act?
i
think
the
brief
filed
by
your
colleague,
the
attorney
general
stated
in
a
footnote
on
page
31
that
in
the
1974
congressional
elections,
unions
spent
$4.3
million,
corporations
$1.6
million,
medical
association
$1.5
million
and
so
on?
what
about
those
concentration
of
corroding
wealth?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
i
do
not
want
to
deter
you
from
proceeding,
but
i
would
like
to
invite
your
attention
to
a
statement
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
attorney
general
as
amicus.
on
page
74,
the
brief
says,
flatly
that
corporations
and
unions
can
accept
and
spend
the
funds
without
limit,
supporting
or
advocating
the
defeat
of
candidates.
now,
of
course
the
brief
could
be
wrong
as
i
think
you
suggest,
but
i
wanted
to
call
that
to
your
attention,
at
page
74
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
takes
issue
with
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
cox,
i
as
understood
you,
you
express
the
view
that
a
challenger
is
not
disadvantaged
by
this
act.
may
i
put
this
hypothetical
to
you?
suppose
the
challenger
is
in
a
district
from
which
the
member
of
congress
has
said
say
for
10
or
15
years
and
therefore
is
very
well
known.
assume
further
that
the
entire
media
in
that
district
supports
the
incumbent.
would
you
think
he
would
have
much
of
a
chance,
i
realize
that
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances,
but
(voice
overlap)
disadvantage.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
cox,
before
you
sit
down
may
i
ask
this
question?
section
608
(e)
limits
citizens
in
what
they
may
stand,
advocating
the
election
or
defeat
and
i
think
the
language
is
a
clearly
identified
candidate.
does
the
act
give
any
assistance
as
to
how
one
determines
who
is
a
clearly
identified
candidate
or
does
the
citizen
act
it
is
parallel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
take
the
present
situation.
suppose
that
question
was
put
to
the
commission
today
in
this
forum,
as
of
today,
who
are
candidates
for
president
in
1976,
what
could
the
commission
say
that
would
be
accurate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
cox,
before
the
republican
convention
in
1916,
charles
evans
hughes,
i
take
it
was
not
a
candidate,
but
suppose
citizens
had
been
spending
large
amounts
of
money
promoting
him,
indeed
some
people
did,
would
this
act
apply
to
him?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
about
1952,
up
to
a
point
adlai
stevenson
was
very
shy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
winter.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
while
you
are
in
this
subject,
is
there
any
limitation,
assuming
that
the
committee
limitation
applies
to
unions
and
corporations
on
the
number
of
committees
that
a
union
or
a
corporation
could
organize?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
cannot
run
under
the
pipe
fitters,
is
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
could
probably
have
a
committee
at
a
minimum
for
each
subsidiary
corporation
and
each
local
union?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
winter,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
happens
to
excess
contributions.
take
a
congressman,
he
is
limited
to
$70,000.00.
suppose
its
contribution
has
totaled
$100,000.00,
what
would
he
do
with
that
$30,000.00?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
his
office
account?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
he
gave
it
to
the
body
for
constituents?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
happens
to
the
appellant
who
loses,
who
has
$30,000.00
in
excess?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
he
give
a
party
for
his
clients?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
clagett
one
final
question.
you
are
not
saying
as
i
understand
your
position
that
public
financing
by
the
government,
rather
the
general
treasury
for
example
is
invalid
per
se,
you
are
saying
it
is
invalid
when
it
is
discriminatory?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
oh!
you
do
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no
way?
