mr.

from
reading
the
briefs
from
the
other

with
all
their
figures
and
all
these
things
you
have
been
throwing
at
us
for
the
last
half
hour,
where
are
we
going
to
put
them
all
in
the
computer?
justice

in
the
first
place,
we
do
not
have
one.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.

how
long
have
we
had
disclosure
and
political
contributions
in
this
country?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
say,
they
have
been
there
all
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
been
there
all
the
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
you
get
to
figure,
will
it
go
up
each
year,
go
up
with
the
cost
of
living?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
please
may
back
up
a
minute
on
your
disclosure
point,
the
$100.00
point?
you
are
talking
about
two
parties,
what
about
the
third
and
unhappy
and
unlighted
and
crusade
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
board
is
disclosing
those
names
and
this
court
said,
that
they
do
not
have
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
they
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
you
say
the
statute
is
basically
unconstitutional
and
all
you
bring
us
is
what
the
commission
has
done.
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
it
is
spatially
unconstitutional
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
we
free
to
interpret
that
without
considering
what
the
commission
has
tried
to
do
or
do
we
have
to
be
bound
by
what
the
commission
has
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
included
that
statement
of
the
commission
and
all
in
some
memorandum
i
saw
the
other
day.
you
also
referred
us
to
new
york
times
or
do
you
want
us
to
consider
that
too,
while
we
are
at
it?
