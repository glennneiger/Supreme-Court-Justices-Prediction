mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
brought
on
january
2nd
of
this
year,
first
business
day
after
the
effective
date
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act
amendments
of
1974,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
the
feca.
it
is
about
a
declaratory
judgment
of
unconstitutionality
and
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
major
provisions
of
that
law,
the
1971,
federal
election
campaign
act
in
subtitle
h
of
the
internal
revenue
code
as
amended
by
the
feca
amendments.
pursuant
to
the
expedited
review
provisions,
the
case
was
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
after
a
remand
to
the
district
court
for
fact
finding,
a
framing
of
the
constitutional
issues
and
a
re-certification
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
three-judge
district
court
considering
always
subtitle
h,
rendered
their
opinions
on
august
15.
the
majority
below
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
every
major
provision
of
the
law,
but
one
and
that
provision
was
not
appealed
and
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
allocation
of
argument
for
both
sides
will
be
as
follows.
i
will
discuss
the
statutory
limits
on
campaign
expenditures
by
political
parties,
committees
and
candidates,
limits
on
contribution
to
political
candidates
and
limits
on
independent
expenditures.
my
colleague
mr.
gora
will
discuss
the
challenge
to
the
act's
disclosure
provisions
and
this
afternoon,
mr.
clagett
will
argue
the
unconstitutionality
of
federal
subsidies
to
political
candidates
and
parties
and
of
the
federal
election
commission.
for
the
appellees,
mr.
friedman
will
discuss
general
principles
and
the
disclosure
provisions.
mr.
cox
will
discuss
the
limits
on
expenditures
and
contributions.
in
the
afternoon,
mr.
cutler
will
discuss
subtitle
h
and
mr.
spritzer,
the
constitutional
alibi
of
the
federal
election
commission.
let
me
briefly
describe
the
statutory
provisions
relevant
to
my
portion
of
argument.
candidates
for
all
federal
offices
are
limited
by
section
608
in
the
amounts
they
may
spend
for
purposes
of
influencing
on
election.
national
committee
and
state
committees
of
a
political
party,
may
make
expenditures
on
behalf
of
candidates
which
are
in
addition
to
the
candidate's
expenditures.
section
608
(e)
prohibits
expenditures
independent
of
the
candidate
in
excess
of
$1,000.00
so
long
is
they
are
relative
to
a
truly
identified
candidate
and
advocating
the
election
or
defeat
of
such
candidate.
the
statute
also
limits
contributions
to
candidates.
no
person
may
contribute
in
access
of
$1,000.00
to
any
candidates
for
federal
office
and
political
committees
registered
for
6
months,
which
have
received
contributions
for
more
than
50
persons
and
have
contributed
to
5
or
more
candidates
for
federal
office
may
make
contributions
to
individual
candidates
up
to
$5,000.00
each?
candidates
may
expend
personal
funds
or
the
funds
of
their
immediate
family
up
to
$50,000.00
in
the
case
of
a
candidate
for
president,
$35,000.00
in
the
case
of
a
candidate
for
the
senate
and
$25,000.00
in
the
case
of
a
candidate
for
the
house.
certain
incidental
out
of
pocket
expenses
incurred
by
volunteers
in
excess
of
$500.00
would
constitute
a
contribution.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
no,
most
of
the
limitations
apply
to
primary
or
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
races
for
the
nomination
and
then
also
for
the
general
election
and
in
some
cases
they
are
different
limits,
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
primary
or
general
election.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
you
mean,
justice
stewart.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
believe,
608
--
well,
certainly
the
limits
on
expenditures
apply
to
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
the
limits
on
expenditures
apply
to
each
separate
election
and
it
is
not
annual.
the
limits
are
independent
expenditures
in
a
year,
so
that
is
just
the
annual
expenditure.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
i
think
my
answer
is
not
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
it
is
not
slightly
annual
as
i
understand
that
the
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes,
i
am
not
sure
it
makes
any
different,
sir.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
that
is
certainly
true,
but
the
definition
of
expenditure
is
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
an
election
and
that
is
a
factual
determination
to
be
made
in
each
case
as
to
which
election
the
particular
expenditure
was
designed
to,
you
know,
was
intended
to
influence.
so,
that
conceivably
under
the
act,
i
take
it
that
expenditures
prior
to
a
primary,
prior
to
a
nomination
can
be
said
by
the
feca,
by
the
commission,
or
by
a
court
interpreting
it,
to
in
fact,
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
general
election.
one
of
the
principles
duties
of
the
federal
election
commission
will
be
to
allocate
to
make
a
determination
which
expenditures
in
particular
cases
are
for
the
purpose
of
which
election.
the
parties
disagree
as
to
the
extent
of
congressional
power
to
regulate
political
communication
under
the
first
amendment,
but
they
all
agreed
on
one
thing,
which
is
that
a
statute
which
intrudes
in
a
delicate
area
of
this
matter
must
be
non-discriminatory
on
its
face.
for
if
it
were
not
the
state
would
be
able
to
regulate
the
unpopular
and
in
effect
regulate
the
content
of
speech.
i
want
to
confront
directly
in
detail
the
contention
that
the
feca
is
not
facially
discriminatory,
for
there
are
several
theory
cases
official
unconstitutionality.
section
608
limits
contributions
to
and
expenditures
by
candidates
as
defined
in
section
591,
essentially
if
anything
of
value,
given
or
employed
to
influence
a
federal
election.
title
39,
u.s.c.,
section
3210
which
is
on
page
81
of
our
volume
3
of
the
appendix,
that
sub-section
e
and
f
explicitly
makes
explicit
exceptions
to
the
definitions
of
contribution
and
expenditures.
what
the
exceptions
are,
are
funds
used
in
preparing
materials
to
be
sent
out
under
the
frank
as
well
as
the
postal
value
of
sending
it
out.
section
3210
(a)
(3)
defines
the
kinds
of
materials
that
maybe
sent
out
under
the
frank.
that
describes
a
variety
of
relevant
materials
which
clearly
influence
elections.
but
most
particularly,
it
includes
“discussions
of
proposed
or
pending
legislation
or
governmental
actions
and
the
positions
of
the
members
of
congress
on
and
arguments
for
or
against
such
matters.”
the
only
limitation
is
that
frank
cannot
be
used
within
28
days
in
election.
now,
since
the
presentation
of
arguments
for
and
against
actions
by
congress
obviously
influence
elections.
the
effect
is
that
section
608
limits
all
contributions
to
or
expenditures
by
challengers
for
purposes
of
mailings
which
debate
governmental
issues,
while
leaving
totally
unregulated
and
unlimited
private
contributions
to
incumbents
to
prepare
materials
which
is
then
send
out
in
unlimited
amounts
at
government
expense.
no
party
to
this
litigations
so
far
as
i
know
disagrees
with
this
interpretation
of
the
statute.
indeed,
even
in
the
propose
regulations
of
the
federal
elections
commission
relating
to
office
accounts,
the
commission
was
at
pains
not
to
treat
funds
supporting
the
activities
describe
in
section
3210
as
either
contributions
or
expenditures.
the
issue
we
raise
is
not
whether
a
congressman
should
be
able
to
communicate
with
their
constituents.
the
issue
is
whether
congress
under
the
first
amendment
made
by
law,
limit
the
ability
of
challengers
to
communicate
with
the
very
same
constituents
without
similarly
limiting
itself.
of
course,
public
officials
need
to
communicate
with
voters,
but
so
do
challengers
and
if
private
contributions
to
challengers
for
use
in
mailing
are
to
be
limited,
since
they
may
corrupt
or
give
the
wealthy
an
unequal
voice,
then
contributions
to
incumbents
for
the
same
purpose
should
also
be
limited.
the
situation
this
statute
establishes
permits
an
incumbent
congressman
say
in
plausible
hypothetical,
to
accept
$40,000.00
from
a
source,
any
source,
which
can
then
be
used
to
prepare
and
it
does
not
have
to
be
disclosed,
which
can
then
be
used
to
prepare
materials.
you
can
give
the
money,you
can
hire
an
advertising
firm
to
prepare
materials
which
can
then
be
sent
out
under
the
frank.
so
that
an
incumbent
congressman
might
except,
give
an
advertising
agency
say
$35,000.00
to
prepare
materials,
send
out
a
150,000
copies
of
something,
which
i
suppose
is
worth
maybe
around
$15,000.00,
none
of
which
accounts
either
as
a
contribution
or
an
expenditure.
if
the
challenger
were
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing,
with
matters
debating
the
pros
and
cons
of
governmental
action,
it
would
all
be
subject
to
the
limits
and
indeed,
in
the
hypothetical
i
have
given,
a
challenger
in
the
house
would
have
used
that
well
over
half
the
expenditure
limit
and
that
is
before
he
has
hired
his
lawyer
and
his
accountant
to
help
them
comply
with
the
statute.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
think
it
is
both,
justice
stewart.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
fifth
amendment
attack
in
that
it
is
an
invidious
discrimination,
but
it
is
also
a
first
amendment
attacking
in
that
it
clearly
regulates
content.
it
permits
more
speech,
greater
speech
by
incumbents
than
by
challengers.
i
think
it
is
almost
exactly
the
case
that
the
court
decided
in
police
department
against
mosley,
involving
a
statute
that
prohibited
all
picketing,
but
picketing
by
a
labor
organization.
so,
i
think
that
the
attack
goes
on
both
grounds.
now,
if
that
is
not
a
facial
discrimination
then
these
words
have
lost
their
meaning.
it
is
not
a
minor
exception.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
i
find
it
difficult,
justice
stewart
though
to
see
why
a
statute
which
prohibits
the
speech
of
some,
but
not
others
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
that
is
content
in
a
very
real,
very,
very
real
sense
and
not
only
that
the
first
amendment
at
the
core
is
the
protection
of
those
outside
the
government.
this
smacks
very
much
of
the
repression
of
political
opponents
in
that
people
outside
the
government
are
not
allowed
to
speak
as
much
as
people
in
and
i
think
that
is
--
if
the
court
finds
the
statute
does
that,
it
is
a
clear
violation
of
first
amendment.
it
is
not
a
minor
exception.
it
involves
millions
and
millions
of
dollars.
more
money
is
found
in
the
frank
by
congressman
then
spent
by
all
congressional
challengers
and
all
campaign
activities.
in
october
1974
on
the
eve
of
the
congressional
election
the
congress
which
past
section
608,
set
out
almost
$22
million
pieces
of
frank
mail
and
the
budget
for
1976,
includes
$46
million
for
use
of
the
frank.
challengers
to
congressional
incumbents
in
1974
spent
only
slightly
$20
million
on
everything.
let
me
make
it
clear,
we
claim
no
misused
of
the
frank.
we
do
not
say,
3210
is
unconstitutional.
it
serves
legitimate
official
purposes,
separating
the
proper
use
of
the
frank
from
the
improper
use
is
simply
intractable.
it
would
make
every
mailing
of
the
frank
a
constitutional
issue.
but
the
frank
does
influence
elections
and
as
stipulated
by
the
parties
and
found
by
the
district
court,
it
is
heaviest
use
is
just
prior
to
election.
attempts
in
congress
by
senator
scott
to
have
the
mailing
privileges
given
to
a
challenger,
given
to
all
candidates
for
federal
office
had
been
defeated.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
frank
cannot
be
using
this
word
or
that
you
cannot
limit
challengers
in
responding
without
even
giving
them
franking
privileges
or
limiting
congress'
own
use
of
it.
we
do
not
abandon
by
means
all
of
the
the
contentions,
but
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
these
provisions
are
unconstitutional
for
these
reasons,
that
would
dispose
of
both
contributions
and
expenditures
under
608
and
the
other
constitutional
issues
can
be
left
to
another
day.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes,
sir.
not,
yes
sir,
the
presidency
might
be
different
because
it
is
penalty
mail,
but
i
would
submit
that
it
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
penalty
mail
situation,
sir
is
precisely
the
same.
the
president
also
has
mailing
privileges
which
are
very
similar
to
those
which
incumbent
congressman
have.
i
would
think
that
it
would
clearly
--
that
the
theory
would
clearly
fit
within
that
and
although
3210
does
not
explicitly
make
the
same
kind
of
explicit
exception
to
fit
to
the
591
definitions,
the
case
there
is
exactly
the
same.
the
president
is
permitted
to
send
out
mailings
like
that.
the
statute,
i
should
say
that
basically
this
argument
i
think
is
applicable
to
all
of
the
many
resources
which
are
available
to
incumbents
which
they
can
vote
themselves
at
will
and
which
are
detailed
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
papers
of
the
party
and
i
will
not
go
into
it.
i
emphasized
3210
because
it
did
have
that
explicit
statutory
language.
the
feca
also
and
this
applies
to
all
federal
races,
officially
discriminates
against
independent
candidates
for
office
by
permitting
party
committees
to
support
their
candidates
over
and
above
the
candidate
expenditure
limit.
candidate
such
as
senator
mccarthy
who
wish
to
demonstrate
their
independence
from
traditional
political
alliances
can
do
so
only
at
the
price
of
having
less
power
to
communicate
with
voters.
no
matter
how
often
the
word
watergate
is
repeated,
it
really
offers
no
valid
explanation
much
less
justification.
forth,
although
the
statute
was
passed
in
the
midst
of
rhetoric
about
reducing
the
influence
of
wealth
and
politics,
in
fact
increases
the
advantage
of
wealthy
candidates.
the
less
wealthy
candidate
is
prohibited
from
rising
seed
money
or
contributions
for
other
purposes
in
amounts
over
a
$1,000.00.
the
wealthy
candidate
on
the
other
hand
can
support
his
campaign
from
personal
funds,
including
large
early
initial
loans
to
the
campaign
which
can
later
be
repaid.
no
reason
which
would
stand
the
scrutiny
has
been
given
to
justify
giving
the
wealthy
disadvantage
in
communication
with
the
voters.
fifth,
we
also
claim
to
this
facial
discrimination
for
the
statute
to
permit
large
contributions
by
political
committees
which
have
been
registered
for
six
months.
they
are
permitted
to
spend
five
times
as
much
other
kinds
of
committees
and
we
believe
that
provision
necessarily
will
help
groups
which
have
permanent
organization,
which
have
continuous
professional
contact,
namely
organized
interest
groups.
ideological
groups
are
less
well
knit.
their
members
are
dispersed.
they
are
not
in
continuous
professional
contact.
they
tend
to
be
generated
by
campaign
activities
which
will
occur
too
late
for
compliance
for
the
six
months
requirement
and
they
tend
to
call
it
less
only
in
response
to
unanticipated
events.
it
is
certainly
true
that
more
ideological
organizations
such
as
the
national
committee
for
an
effective
congress
or
the
conservative
victory
fund
will
continue
to
exist.
they
will,
however,
be
limited
by
the
$5,000.00
limit
and
will
be
less
able
to
proliferate
the
number
of
six
months
committees
in
existence.
organized
interest
groups,
at
least
those
with
a
geographic
basis,
which
can
organize
horizontally
are
able
to
proliferate
committees
and
that
is
why
it
seems
to
us
that
is
very
clear
that
the
practice
of
this
industry
which
have
been
heavily
relied
upon
in
the
court
below
can
continue

contrary
to
the
rhetoric
which
accompany
passage
of
the
feca,
the
statute
in
particular
favors
the
use
of
corporate
and
union
money
for
political
activities.
both
are
permitted
to
spend
statutorily
unlimited
sums
to
raise
money
for
so
called

to
finance
six-month
political
committees.
union
or
corporate
money
is
thus
spent
to
raise
money
and
that
money
is
distributed
without
reference
to
the
wishes
to
the
donors.
in
effect
to
some
extent,
the
feca
reformed
the
problem
of
legal
corporate
contributions
when
making
them
less
necessary.

has
been
very
sharp
increase
in

with
no
visible
increase
in

i
should
say
that
the
change
statute
made
was
to
include
corporations
with
government
contracts
in
their
provisions
permitting
corporations
to
setup

the

the
record
indicates,
for
example,
in
1972
that
attorney
general
kelly
may
well
have
been
able
to
raise,
wage
a
stronger
race
against
senator
griffin,
had
he
been
able
to
obtain
a
level
of
campaign
spending,
enabling
him
to
focus
the
voters
attention
more
on
economic
issues
in
which
he
was
thought
to
be
strong,
rather
than
on
the
raging
busing
controversy
where
he
was
thought
to
be

in
that
kind
of
situation
the
busing
was
a
controversial

of
any
activities
of
senator
griffin
could
be
overcome

senator
kelly,

appellees
believe
these
propositions
are
common
sense
propositions.
we
do
not
think
there
is
speculation
at
all.
indeed,
they
are
now
the
law
of
the
feca,
according
to
a
ruling
of
commission.
in
an
advisory
ruling,
involving
senator
benson,
the
commission
explicitly
relied
on
the
fact
that
an
incumbent's
exposure
is
the
equivalent
of
substantial
campaign
expenditures.
senator
benson
has
announced
that
he
intends
to
run
in
both
the
texas
presidential
and
senatorial
primaries.
the
commission,
fearful
that
his
combined
expenditures
will
influence
each
of
these
simultaneous
campaigns,
ruled
that
senator
benson
may
only
spend
the
amount
permissible
for
the
senate
primary,
all
together.
his
major
anticipated
adversary
in
the
presidential
primary,
governor
wallas
was
less
free
to
out
spend
him
two
to
one
since
presidential
primary
candidates
can
spend
twice
the
senate
limit.
in
handing
down
this
ruling,
the
commission
said
“within
texas,
the
reduced
presidential
primary
expenditure
limitation
applicable
to
senator
benson
are
compensated
for
by
the
fact
that
he
is
already
the
senator
from
texas
and
thus
within
texas
begins
with
the
significant
exposure
advantage
over
his
rivals.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
the
point
i
am
making,
justice
rehnquist
is
at
while
the
commission
in
this
court
is
claiming
that
kind
of
proposition
as
speculation
and
would
not
justify
the
court
holding
expenditures
limits
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
i
have
said.
now,
the
point
is
that
they
themselves
are
relaying
on
that
proposition
to
make
decisions
below.
i
am
not
arguing
whether
the
ruling
was
correct
or
incorrect.
i
am
just
arguing
that
it
is
a
well-known
proposition
known
to
everyone.
so,
well
known
that
commission
relied
on
it
and
had
no
problems
whatsoever.
i
think
these
propositions
are
as
much
common
sense
propositions
as
the
proposition
that
equal
space
statute
say
in
tornillo,
made
detroit
newspapers
from
printing
controversial
editorials.
i
think
every
first
amendment
of
this
court
involves
judgments
as
to
the
factual
impact
of
the
statute.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
am
only
asking
you
to
take
the
rationale
of
the
consideration.
i
am
not
asking
you
to
address
yourself
to
the
merits
of
whether
governor
wallas
and
other
presidential
aspirants
should
be
able
to
outspend
senator
benson
two
to
one.
i
think
the
merits
of
that
are
irrelevant
to
the
argument
here,
except
insofar
as
they
demonstrate
the
belief
of
those,
the
widespread
belief
that
exposure
is
the
equivalent
of
substantial
campaign
expenditures.
they
are
also
relevant
i
might
say
to
show
the
kind
of
deep
intrusion
the
statute
makes
in
that
the
commission
will
be
asked
time
and
again
to
address
the
question,
how
much
will
this
candidate
be
able
to
speak
in
election
and
how
much
will
another.
i
am
not
sure,
i
am
being
responsive
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
similar
disadvantages
are
visited
upon
challengers
by
the
limits
on
contributions.
incumbents
are
as
we
described
in
our
papers,
large
advantages
in
raising
contributions
under
the
statute
because
of
mailing
list
they
develop
from
the
frank
and
the
like.
indeed,
although
one
might
have
anticipated
that
fundraising
would
be
more
difficult,
the
figures
show
that
by
september
30th
of
this
year,
incumbent
senators
up
the
next
time
have
already
raised
over
$2
million.
at
a
corresponding
time
in
1974,
they
have
raised
less
than
a
million-and-a-half.
so,
they
are
not
having
any
trouble
raising
it
because
they
have
all
of
this
time
to
raise
it
which
challengers
do
not
and
time
is
critical
when
you
are
raising
small
contributions.
there
is
one
argument;
well,
the
argument
that
the
statute
helps
challengers
because
offsets
the
superior
fund
raising
ability
of
incumbents
seems
to
us
to
be
an
error.
the
greatest
differential
in
funds
is
in
those
races
in
which
the
challengers
simply
as
little
or
no
plausible
chance
of
election.
the
limits
in
those
circumstances
have
little
impact
because
the
outcome
is
certain
and
because
spending
is
often
less
than
the
limits.
the
impact
in
those
races
which
are
competitive,
however,
will
be
drastic,
but
those
races
are
the
very
races
in
which
the
differential
in
funds
is
leased.
in
1974,
in
the
house,
if
you
take
all
the
races
in
which
the
challenger
did
raise
70,000
or
more,
the
amount
raised
by
all
such
challengers
in
fact
substantially
exceeded
the
amounts
raised
by
the
incumbents
is
they
faced.
the
limits
already
have
an
effect
on
those
races
where
equality
is
greatest
at
the
present
moment.
the
burden
of
the
feca
rest
full
heavily
on
those
challenging
the
status
quo
by
impairing
the
ability
of
challengers
both
to
raise
and
spend
money.
this
legislation
makes
it
acutely
difficult
for
them
to
overcome
the
exposure,
incumbents
already
enjoy.
i
do
not
think
there
could
be
any
question
about
this.
if
they
were
five
restaurants
in
the
town
and
someone
was
about
to
open
a
new
one,
an
ordinance
severely
limiting
the
amount
of
newspaper
advertising
restaurants
might
buy,
would
be
recognized
for
what
it
is,
an
attempt
by
the
existing
restaurants
to
freeze
out
new
comers.
i
do
not
make
claim
of
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
drive
out
and
to
freeze
out
new
comers.
i
do
claim,
however,
that
the
effect
will
be
to
do
that.
i
think
the
record
demonstrates
these
propositions.
the
vast
majority
of
congressional
challengers
in
the
last
two
elections
have
spent
over
what
are
now
the
feca
limits,
if
appropriate
adjustments
were
made
for
inflation.
senator
mccarthy's
1968
new
hampshire
campaign,
which
seemed
hopeless
in
the
beginning,
which
was
widely
reported
as
a
campaign
run
mostly
by
volunteers
was
in
fact
a
very
heavily
monied
campaign,
one
of
the
most
money
campaigns
up
to
date.
senator
mccarthy
spent
$12.00
per
vote
received
as
against
$.077
spent
in
the
general
election
by
richard
nixon
that
it
--
and
it
adjusted
for
inflation,
that
is
around
$18.00.
if
his
spending
had
been
otherwise,
the
outcome
would
been
otherwise
and
had
been
limited,
the
outcome
would
been
otherwise
and
the
efforts
of
his
many
volunteer
supporters,
who
are
also
helped
by
the
heavy
spending
would
have
been
for
naught.
the
same
is
true
of
the
reliance
of
challengers
on
large
contributions.
again,
the
mccarthy
campaign
in
1968
is
detailed
in
the
record,
as
is
senator
buckley's
1970
campaign
in
which
the
landlords
and
the
phone
company
would
not
even
talk
to
him,
unless
he
came
up
with
certified
checks
for
$36,000.00.
his
beginning
efforts
were
financed
through
a
large
loan
which
the
feca
would
outlaw.
the
record
also
demonstrates
beyond
any
question
that
senator
mcgovern's
campaign
would
have
floundered
if
the
feca
had
been
in
effect.
from
the
beginning
of
his
campaign,
until
the
new
hampshire
primary,
until
three
days
after
the
new
hampshire
primary,
senator
mcgovern
would
have
lost
$636,882.00
in
contributions.
since
direct
mail
techniques
in
which
he
was
relying
heavily,
required
the
much
of
the
return
--
the
much
of
the
contributions
of
the
return
on
contributions
be
plowed
back
in,
these
large
contributions
had
to
be
critical
to
his
early
efforts.
the
answer
to
the
question
is
this
law
that
reform
a
claims
to
be
is
clearly
no,
quite
apart
from
its
discriminatory
effect.
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
stated
ends
and
the
means
adopted.
in
fact,
there
are
remedies
which
are
available,
are
readily
available
with
greater
efficacy
and
had
considerably
less
impact
on
first
amendment
values.
the
record
demonstrates
something
about
the
effectiveness
of
disclosure.
in
going
to
the
record,
it
appears
in
1972
that
large,
large
numbers
of
the
large
contributions
and
the
suspicious
contributions
which
led
to
the
passage
of
the
feca
were
passed
before
the
disclosure
provisions
were
in
effect
or
after
the
election
when
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
go
before
the
record.
the
appellees
state
that
153
contributors
give
$20
million
to
the
nixon
campaign.
from
the
source
they
sighted,
we
calculate
that
$16
million
of
that
was
given
before
april
7,
1972.
all
parties
have
agreed
and
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
effective
disclosure
before
that
date.
indeed
on
april
5th
and
april
6th
$5.5
million
was
raised
and
a
total
of
20
million
was
raised
by
the
nixon
campaign
before
the
disclosure
date.

mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
the
figures
that
i
have
been
throwing
at
you
were
justice
marshall
need
to
go
in
a
computer.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
--if
this
statute
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
that
made
my
answer
to
the
question
easy.
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
the
figures
that
are
there,
are
fairly
clear
in
their
import
and
there
is
another
factor
which
i
think
is
critical,
that
is,
if
the
statute
is
upheld,
you
lose
the
controller
group.
you
will
never
again
have
high
spending
challengers
to
look
to,
to
see
whether
this
high
spending
is
necessary
for
them
to
defeat
incumbents.
once
the
statute
is
in
effect
and
running,
there
will
be
no
more
figures
before
any
court
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
what
effect
the
statute
is
having.
these
are
the
only
figures
that
ever
going
to
be
available
to
make
a
thorough
judgment
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
law.
the
only
figures
you
will
have
from
now
on
would
be
incumbency
rate.
you
will
never
know
whether
high
spending
challenge
--
whether
high
spending
is
necessary
to
challengers
or
not.
the
figures
i
am
discussing
right
now,
demonstrate
in
their
totality,
only
that
large
contributors
and
contributors
with
improper
motives
fear
disclosure
to
the
voters.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
think
that
is
very
likely
true
in
a
large
number
of
cases.
i
would
think
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
best
way
--
i
of
course
cannot
give
an
equivocal
answer
that
they
would
not
have
contributed,
but
april
7th
is
a
very,
very
early
day
and
contributions,
large
contributions
after
an
election
are
too
late
for
disclosure
and
particularly
in
election
like
1972
where
there
was
little
doubt
about
the
outcome,
it
seems
to
me,
strongly
suggest
a
powerful
desire
to
avoid
disclosure.
now,
whether
they
would
given
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
i
suspect
the
milk
people
probably
would
not
have.
i
suspect
in
the
case
of
the
ambassadorships,
they
probably
would
not
have,
but
disclosure
does
have
one
virtue
that
no
other
remedy
has
and
that
is
it
leaves
it
to
the
voter.
even
if
they
did
continue
to
give,
the
voter
would
be
able
to
decide
in
each
case
whether
he
--
whether
that
voter
thought
that
a
particular
candidate
was
going
to
be
overly
beholden
to,
if
you
want
to
call
them
special
interest,
was
receiving
to
many
large
contributions
from
a
particular
source,
whether
people
will
continue
to
give
after
effective
disclosure
depends
on
what
the
voters
think
and
that
is
the
way
it
should
be
in
a
democratic
system.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
is
impermissible
for
congress
to
attempt
to
bring
about
these
remedies
by
lowering
the
level
of
political
communication
when
disclosure
is
available
and
when
other
remedies
are
also
available.
remedy
such
as
prohibitions
on
large
late
contributions
which
is
certainly
a
viable
remedy,
it
responds
to
everything
that
was
cited
in
support
of
the
feca
and
it
is
not
in
the
statute.
i
think
that,
while
congress
in
deciding
to
have
disclosure,
has
considerable
discretion
in
determining
what
kind
of
disclosure
and
when,
but
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
really
try,
that
they
can
remedy
this
by
stopping
essentially
political
speech.
certainly
limits
on
candidates
expenditures,
justice
rehnquist
cannot
be
justified
by
any
theory
that
the
feca,
any
evil
the
feca
claims
the
remedy,
certainly
limits
on
independent
expenditure,
it
seems
to
me
cannot
be
justified
that
way.
the
problem
has
to
be,
if
there
is
a
problem
in
equality
argument
and
in
the
argument
that
the
candidates,
once
they
assumed
office,
will
be
overly
beholden
and
obligated
to
certain
contributors.
in
the
case
of
the
equality
argument
i
think
it
is
demonstrated
in
the
record
that
you
cannot
bring
about
equality
without
producing
more
inequality,
either
that
or
silence
itself.
that
the
challengers,
people
are
challenging
the
status
quo,
rely
heavily
on
money
and
you
have
to
freeze
them
out
in
the
name
of
equality
and
that
is
wrongs.
second,
equality
is
an
impermissible
goal
in
any
event
because
the
danger
sought
to
be
remedied
when
you
try
to
reduce
equality,
inequality
in
political
voice,
the
dangers
stems
from
the
communicative
nature
of
the
act
itself.
it
is
not
like
o'brien
where
you
had
a
congressional
purpose
unrelated
to
free
speech.
it
is
like
tucker
and
other
cases
where
the
danger
was
perceived
in
communicative
act.
so,
it
seems,
as
for
the
obligation
of
candidates,
i
think
candidates
are
obligated
to
their
voters.
they
want
votes,
they
do
not
want
money.
they
need
money
to
communicate
with
the
voters
and
i
think
their
ultimate
obligation
is
to
them
and
i
think
if
there
was
effective
disclosure,
they
will
not
become
overly
burdened
with
obligations.
i
might
also
say,
if
you
speculate
for
a
moment
about
when
obligations
are
most
likely
to
be
created,
it
would
not
be
in
the
case
of
safe
seats,
it
is
only
in
the
case
of
close
or
highly
competitive
seats.
that
is
where
people
do
need
money
to
run
effective
campaigns,
but
those
are
also
cases
in
which
the
person
has
to
be
the
most
fearful
of
what
the
voters
thinks
has
to
be
the
most
sensitive
to
voters'
wishes.
when
you
are
dealing
with
safe
seats,
large
contributions
do
create
real
dangers,
but
the
remedy
for
that
is
to
be
sure
that
the
candidate
receiving
the
contributions,
makes
expenditures
only
for
voter
persuasion
and
is
not
permitted
as
the
present
statute
does
--
permits
him,
to
use
campaign
funds
for
a
variety
of
non-speech
purposes.
by
regulating
expenditures
you
can
solve
the
obligation
problem
in
safe
seats.
now,
virtually
a
large
numbers
of
the
large
contributions
or
improper
contributions
described
in
the
appendix
were
made
well
before
april
7th
or
after
the
election.
this
statute
violates
i
think
the
coherent
and
established
case
law
in
this
court.
it
seems
to
me
in
the
new
york
times
against.
sullivan,
tornillo,
mills,
o’brien,
red
lion
and
letter
carriers
are
not
inconsistent.
the
principle
of
non-interference
in
political
communication
in
every
case
is
consistent
with
the
outcome
in
those
decisions.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
statute,
there
is
no
way,
that
this
statute
can
be
viewed
other
than
as
an
attempt
to
regulate
political
communication,
indeed
to
regulate
the
content
of
political
communication
by
intricate
web
of
statutory
and
administrative
rulings
which
redirect
and
re-channel
political
speech
as
well
as
limit
it.
the
greatest
campaign
reform
law
ever
enacted
was
the
first
amendment,
relying
the
proposition
that
good
speech
will
drive
out
bad
and
all
appellants
ask
is,
the
court
enforce
that.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
just
briefly
clear
up
one
part
point
of
confusion,
found
on
one
of
our
appendix
page
39.
it
alleged
that
steward
mott
desires
to
make
independent
expenditures
on
behalf
of
a
candidate
in
excess
of
$1,000.00
and
the
other
candidates
who
are
plaintiffs,
appellants
here
make
allegations
that
they
wish
to
have
people
make
such
expenditures
on
their
behalf.
let
me
also
address
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
section
610
in
the
segregated
funds.
i
must
confess
that
we
see
vagueness
there
as
else
where
and
we
are
not
able
to
endorse
the
attorney
general’s
flat
position
that
unions
and
corporations
may
spend
unlimited
amounts
from
segregated
funds.
i
do
not
think
in
any
sense
that
even
if
it
is
read
to
mean
that
they
must
spend
through
six-month
political
committees,
the
statute
still
gives
them
relatively
far
more
power
than
they
had
previously.
they
are
permitted,
first
under
pipe
fitters,
the
unions
and
the
corporations
clearly
control
the
dispersal
of
the
funds.
that
is
the
explicit
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan’s
decision,
i
believe
it
was,
is
that
we
hold,
at
page
384,
we
hold
that
such
a
fund
must
be
separate
from
the
sponsoring
union
only
in
the
sense
that
there
must
be
strict
segregation
of
its
moneys
from
union
dues
and
assessments.
and
i
take
it
that
continues
now,
otherwise
it
would
violate,
if
the
union
or
corporation
did
not
control
the
funds,
it
violate
the
probation
on
earmarking,
so
that
they
do
control
the
funds.
now,
they
are
permitted
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
we
say
no
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
no,
i
would
think
that
it
would
have
to
--
i
would
think
that
the
fec
would
have
the
rule
by
theater
or
however
they
do
it.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
would
certainly
think
that
is
true,
yes
and
where
you
have
interest
like
the
daily
interest
on
a
county
basis,
that
can
be
done
horizontally
across
the
country.
there
is
three
reasons
why
unions
and
corporations
have
great
power
under
statute
relative
to
other
groups.
the
first
is
that
they
can
engage
in
unlimited
spending
to
raise
money
for
the
segregated
funds.
as
far
as
we
can
tell
from
a
statute
they
are
permitted
to
spend
as
much
as
they
want
from
their
treasuries
to
raise
money
from
a
members,
employees
and
stockholders.
second
they
can
spend
unlimited
funds
to
communicate
with
employee,
members
and
stockholders
and
this
alleged
or
is
believed
of
great
value
because
communications
with
those
people
necessarily
reach
large
numbers
of
other
voters.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
think
it
does
and
it
fits
in
two
ways.
one,
i
think
it
is
facial
discrimination
and
a
regulation
of
content.
here
we
have
almost
exactly
the
situation
faced
by
the
court
in
mosley
where
there
is
a
general
probation
on
a
certain
kind
of
a
speech
with
an
exception
made
for
labor
organizations.
secondly,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
shows
beyond
any
question
that
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
the
ends
that
are
used
to
justify
the
statute
and
the
means
employed.
this
record,
this
appendix
is
thick
with
contributions
by
business
and
union
interests
which
the
statute
is
alleged
to
diminish,
whose
influence
the
statute
was
supposed
to
stop
and
indeed
the
allegation
is
made
over
and
over
again,
that
the
prime
source
of
corruption
or
improper
obligation
comes
from
organized
economic
interest
groups.
i
think
if
we
show
that
in
fact
under
the
statute
and
i
think
we
shown,
convincingly,
that
under
the
statute
that
those
groups
have
more
power
relative
--
relatively
more
power
because
of
the
limitation
placed
on
other
groups
and
the
freedom
left
to
them,
i
think
we
have
shown
its
unconstitutionality.
the
third
way
in
which
they
are
made
relatively
more
powerful
is
that
the
six-month
political
committee
provision
is
really
tailored
to
their
use
for
purposes
i
have
explained
before
and
allows
them
to
spend
five
times
as
much
as
other
kinds
of
committees
and
individuals.
there
is
nothing
anywhere
that
i
know
off
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
suggesting
in
anyway
that
any
justification
for
those
provisions
and
that
have
to
do
with
the
asserted
justifications
for
the
statute.
now,
reference
has
been
made
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
limits,
i
think
when
the
court
addresses
the
legislative
history
or
finds
it,
it
is
quite
simple,
they
kept
going
down.
from
the
original
proposals,
they
got
lower
and
lower
and
indeed
we
are
in
some
disagreement
with
mr.
cox’s
description
of
the
situation
and
i
believe
it
was
november,
1973
when
common
clause
testified
before
congress.
i
am
reading
from
mr.
gardner’s
testimony.
the
bill
passed
by
the
senate
would
allow
candidates
for
the
house
to
spend
$90,000.00
in
primary
races
and
another
$90,000.00
in
the
general
election.
some
have
advocated
expenditure
limits
substantially
lower
than
those
contained
in
that
bill,
35,
000;
42,500;
50,
000
are
among
the
figures
which
have
been
mentioned
as
preferable.
common
clause
considers
that
any
substantial
reduction
of
the
figures
in
s-372
which
was
90,000
in
both
elections,
would
virtually
guarantee
a
permanent
re-election
of
incumbent
members
of
congress.
now,
of
course
they
did
reduce
the
limits
after
that
and
in
fact
it
would
not
adjust
for
inflation,
the
limits
of
the
senate
bill
at
that
time
were
a
$100,800.00
for
each
election.
so
there
was
a
various
substantial
reduction
after
that.
the
legislative
history
in
the
senate,
repeatedly,
floor
managers
and
the
like
in
the
senate
stated
that
the
house
could
write
their
ticket
to
the
senate
or
not
review
what
the
house
was
doing.
now,
i
think
it
is
clear
in
our
brief
what
our
objections
to
their
statistical
figures
and
in
particular
the
comparison
with
the
overall
combined
limit
in
that
the
statute
in
no
way
permits
candidates
to
aggregate.
you
have
to
spend
to
influence
a
particular
election
and
comparison
--
comparing
previous
spending
with
an
overall
combine
limit,
comparing
that
with
previous
spending
by
candidates
who
had
one
serious
race,
simply
does
not
make
any
sense.
i
might
also
say,
suppose
it
does
not
for
a
challengers,
suppose
it
is
as
even
handed,
no
one
really
denies
that
it
is
not
going
to
affect
the
outcome
of
elections.
no
one
really
plans
that
is
not
going
to
have
an
impact.
indeed
the
whole
reason
was
to
reduce
the
amount
of
political
speech
in
which
people
were
engaging.
that
seems
to
me
clearly
the
party
will
affect
the
outcome
of
elections.
it
does
not
matter
who
is
affected,
it
is
still
a
first
amendment
problem.
the
public
will
suffer
because
of
this
expose
to
less
and
less
information,
less
and
less
the
debate,
the
less
participatory
activities
by
volunteers
and
the
like.
virtually,
all
the
evils
that
have
been
suggested
in
this
court,
in
no
real
sense
call
for
limitations
on
candidate
expenditures.
the
ones
we
have
now
because
it
costs
so
much
to
raise
large
contributions,
really
induce
candidates
to
try
and
raise
contributions
in
as
high
amount
as
they
possibly
can
because
they
save
that
much
on
fund
raising.
also,
there
is
no
reason
certainly
to
limit
campaigns,
the
amount
campaigns
can
spend
whether
or
not
they
are
raising
in
a
large
contributions.
this
statute
limits
--
would
have
put
limits
on
the
campaign
of
a
candidate
like
ramsey
clark
who
has
announced,
who
did
announce
that
he
would
not
spend
over
--
would
not
receive
contributions
over
a
$100.00.
now,
i
have
not
heard
anything
today
which
would
call
for
limits
on
expenditures,
extraordinary
spending
provisions
for
state
and
national
party
committees,
distinctions
between
kinds
of
committees
which
permit
greater
freedom
to
some
than
to
others
and
indeed,
i
would
think
that
if
congress
was
serious
about
what
it
was
claiming
it
was
doing
or
if
it
had
sought
and
considered
a
far
simpler
law,
it
might
have
had
a
better
solution,
not
just
the
better
one
but
one
more
constitutional.
a
law
that
restricted
total
contributions
of
individuals,
to
candidates
or
committees
to
say
something
like
a
total
of
$35,000.00
in
an
election
year
and
adequate
disclosure
provisions
for
timely
notice
of
large
contributions,
would
prevent
corruption,
bring
about
a
quality
at
least
as
much
as
the
feca
and
yet
would
not
have
the
same
stringent
impact
on
challengers,
to
incumbents
or
other
candidates.
we
do
not
say
it
is
a
constitutional,
but
of
all
the
major
constitutional
issues
in
this
court,
all
but
one,
disappear
with
a
law
of
that
kind.
nothing
demonstrated
in
congress
or
in
the
record
here
calls
for
either
the
complexities
or
the
intrusiveness
of
the
feca.
we
filed
this
amicus
attack
is
for
the
extend
of
our
challenge,
but
this
complex
network
of
intricate
distinction
is
just
wholly
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
itself
is
a
signal
that
more
loopholes
more,
more
inequalities
are
being
created.
i
think
that
608
(e)
demonstrates
the
intrusiveness
of
this
law.
the
idea
that
a
law
putting
almost
a
flat
ban
on
the
purchase
of
political
advertising
by
individuals,
can
be
called
a
loophole-closing
provision.
it
is
not
only
contrary
to
the
major
trust
court’s
decisions
for
years,
but
demonstrates
just
how
intrusive
this
statute
is
on
the
free
political
debate
in
this
country.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
think
in
florida
--
florida
i
believe
has
one.
yes.
most
of
the
state
laws
as
i
understand
it,
the
florida
law
is
the
stringent,
most
of
the
state
laws
resemble
the
prior
federal
law
which
was
not
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well
no,
it
had
limit
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
but
not
effective
limitation.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
so
that
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
understand
florida
that
--
i
think
--
i
believe
and
i
might
be
wrong,
but
the
florida
provision
i
believe
gives
the
candidate
a
veto
on
expenditures.
i
am
not
sure
that.
it
is
similar
to
the
–
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
right.
i
think
that
is
right,
but
i
could
be
wrong.
i
think
that
the
extent
of
pebble
in
first
amendment
law
is
nowhere
better
demonstrated
in
the
arguments
and
briefs
presented
here.
every
time
the
appellees
put
their
first
minute
positions
in
the
form
of
a
generalization,
it
is
just
foreign
to
established
notions
of
freedom
of
expression.
instead
of
a
robust,
uninhibited
debate,
they
draw
analogies
between
oral
arguments
in
courts
with
equal
page
links
and
equal
time
for
argument
and
explicit
call
for
a
drastic
application,
i
would
think
of
something
like
red-line
to
the
whole
political
process.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
have
trouble.
i
think
that
congress
because
of
watergate,
was
under
enormous
political
pressure
to
do
something.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
your
honor
our
opinion
i
gather
is
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
--
draw
inference,
is
that
they
were
under
pressure
to
do
something
and
as
one
unidentified
congressman
was
alleged
to
have
said
and
was
quoted
in
the
papers,
any
time
they
could
vote
for
reform
and
freeze
out,
vote
for
what
was
called
reform
and
freeze
out
opponents
at
the
same
time,
there
was
only
one
thing
they
could
do
and
i
am
being
pushed
to
make
an
argument,
i
think
i
--
but
that
is
our
opinion.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
the
elimination
of
corruption?
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
no,
i
accept
that
as
a
proper
goal.
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
can
point
to
explicit
provisions.
they
reduced
the
statute
of
limit,
dropped
the
statue
of
limitations
by
two
years
for
watergate
related
crimes.
they
passed
the
provision
explicitly
permitting
them
to
spend
their
excess
campaign
funds
for
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
no
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
think
arguably
the
limits
on
contributions
does
seem
to
move
in
that
direction.
expenditures
absolutely,
i
think
that
does
move
any
direction
of
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
for
what
they
were
trying
to
do?
i
think
that
both
of
those
provisions
badly
damage
challengers
to
incumbents
and
i
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well,
they
are
under
a
lot
of
political
pressure
to
do
something
and
this
was
the
most
palatable
thing
that
could
be
done.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well
if
so,
it
is
something
that
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
should
look
at
because
it
is
a
cosmetic
that
involves
asset
and
is
given
only
to
challengers.
i
suspect,
i
see
very
few
limits
in
here
on
things
that
might
lead
to
corruption.
for
instance,
they
can
take
unlimited,
undisclosed
funds
for
office
accounts
and
for
preparing
materials
to
send
out
under
the
fact.
that
is
simply
inconsistent
with
a
desire
to
eliminate
corruption.
it
is
just
totally
inconsistent
with
it,
quite
apart
from
the
discriminatory
effect
against
challengers.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
well
he
can
do
several
things.
he
can
put
it
in
an
office
account
--
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
yes
or
he
can
--
the
statute
explicitly
says
he
can
use
it
for
any
lawful
purpose,
to
any
lawful
purposes
for
the
ward.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
that
is
the
way
we
read
it
sir.
mr.
ralph
k.
winter,
jr.
i
do
not
--
it
does
not
say
what
he
