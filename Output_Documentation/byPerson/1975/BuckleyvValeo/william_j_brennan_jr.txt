justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
is
that
provisions
do
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
and
to
that
extent
suppose
the
provision
go
to
far
and
strike
them
to
that
extent,
would
you
then
be
satisfied
towards
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both
aspects
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
we
should
pick
out
$1,000.00
or
500
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
if
the
fact
so
then
the
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
questions
is
that
there
is
anything
left
and
we
have
to
strike
it
down
facially
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
it
does
not
care
about
the
contribution
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
victor
hopes
that
the
donor
does
not
care
about
or
the
other
donor
hopes
that
the
victorious
candidate
does
care
about
the
donorsâ€™
contribution,
is
elusive?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
any
limitation
say
on
contributions
to
a
particular
candidate,
out
of
the
segregated
union
or
corporate
funds
apply
to
those
funds,
does
it,
pipefitters
is
the
610?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
remember.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
see
anything
in
610
itself
would
subject
contributions
on
those
segregated
funds
to
the
limitation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suggest
in
the
first
instance
the
commission
would
have
to
determine
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
suggested
to
me
earlier
namely
whether
or
not
these
segregated
funds
are
to
be
treated
as
political
committees
as
a
question
in
the
first
instance
to
be
decided
by
the
commission.
so,
i
take
it
we
do
not
reach
that
question
in
this
case
for
the
purpose
of
deciding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
suggested
that
there
could
not
be
until
after
the
commission
had
in
the
first
instance
decided
whether
or
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman
could
that
corporation
have
set-up
a
segregated
fund
and
solicited
or
set-up
a
desk
in
the
front
office
and
said
anyone
who
wants
to
contribute,
contribute
it
and
247
came
along,
made
contributions
totaling
$28,025.00
and
then
under
the
attorney
general's
suggestion
i
gather
that
could
have
been
spend
by
that
fund
anyway
they
want
it
without
any
disclosures
of
the
names
of
those
247?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
are
suggesting
that
the
issue
it
is
not
a
personal
remedy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
i
thought
you
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
first
amendment
problem,
that
any
first
amendment
rights
are
overridden
by
compelling
the
governmental
interest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
basic
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
even
as
to
a
candidate
not
formally
declared
to
be
such,
the
commission
might
find
him
nevertheless
a
candidate?
i
want
an
advice
or
the
opinion
for
purposes
of
608
(e)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
a
formal
declaration
that
he
is
a
candidate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
as
i
read
the
newspapers
and
listen
to
this
news,
television
news
reports
and
so
forth,
some
individuals
who
say
they
are
not
yet
decided
whether
they
are
candidates
or
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
clagett
i
know
this
is
not
--
i
just
to
get
it.
if
one
is
a
presidential
candidate,
elects
to
take
public
funding,
he
cannot
take
private
contributions,
can
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
any
is
contributed
what
happens
what
happens
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
address
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
not
be
that
separate
mr.
clagett,
but
there
of
course
the
remedy
was
for
the
attack
of
the
union
member
to
get
it
back.
here,
he
may
check
off
or
not
as
he
pleases,
but
it
does
not
get
his
dollar
back.
those
in
the
general
treasury
is
taxed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
is
all
the
members
of
the
presidential
appointees,
but
either
house
could
veto
now
and
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
just
the
legislative
veto
itself
renders
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
scheme
on
constitution.
