mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
mr.
clagett
has
not
invested
much
of
his
oral
argument
in
his
arguments
as
to
the
power
of
the
federal
government
under
the
general
welfare
clause
to
provide
for
public
financing
of
election
campaigns
and
since
he
has
not
devoted
much
time
to
his
argument
that
any
such
plan
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
which
he
moves
by
implication
over
into
the
free
speech
section
of
the
first
amendment.
i
shall
concentrate,
as
he
did,
on
the
alleged
discriminatory
effects
of
this
particular
proposed
public
financing
plan
against
the
smaller
parties.
i
would
like
to
first
stress
that
the
appellants
show
little
proof
of
injury
to
them
to
support
their
claim
that
these
provisions
should
be
voided
before
they
have
had
a
chance
to
work
in
a
single
election.
of
the
twelve
plaintiffs
in
this
action,
only
four
assert
any
interest
in
the
public
financing
of
presidential
campaigns.
one
is
eugene
mccarthy
whose
claim
is
wholly
academic
as
to
discrimination
because
he
has
testified
on
deposition
in
this
case,
that
he
would
have
not
accepted
public
financing
even
if
he
was
eligible.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
this
were
an
attack
on
any
public
financing,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
yes.
but
the
attack
at
least
on
the
discrimination
front
is
an
attack
that
the
public
financing
provided
to
the
so
called
major
parties
is
a
discrimination
against
him.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
say
he
presents
no
case
to
you
that
he
is
being
discriminated
against
by
reason
of
the
5%
provision
or
the
money
before
or
money
after
provisions
when
he
says
i
would
not
take
it
anyway,
if
it
were
offered.
the
same
is
true
of
course
of
his
party,
his
committee
for
a
constitutional
presidency
which
is
a
second
plaintiff.
the
same
is
true
of
the
libertarian
party
which
testified
on
deposition
that
it
would
not
accept
public
financing
if
offered
and
in
the
case
of
the
fourth
plaintiff,
the
conservative
party
of
new
york
has
never
nominated
a
presidential
candidate
who
was
not
also
a
candidate
of
the
major
party
and
thus
entitled
to
the
full
allotment.
and
no
other
political
party
or
any
present
aspirant
for
their
76
nominations
is
before
you
in
this
case,
although
the
socialist
workers
party
has
filed
an
amicus
brief.
so
most
of
the
fascinating
hypotheticals
which
fill
appellant’s
briefs
and
our
replies
what
would
have
happen
in
1856,
mr.
justice
stewart,
whether
the
equal
amounts
for
the
first
and
second
parties
are
unfair
as
between
the
two
of
them
or
vis-a-vis
third
party,
what
would
have
happen
of,
bull
moose,
eugene
debs,
we
say
or
just
at
the
moment
at
least
fascinating
hypotheticals
for
the
political
huts
totally
that
can
justly
and
should
better
be
left
for
another
day.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
depends
on
how
you
define
third
party
mr.
chief
justice.
if
you
define
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
if
you
say
after
the
first
two
in
any
particular
election
and
if
you
ignore
some
of
the
very
early
elections
in
the
1832
period
and
there
abouts,
i
suppose
the
largest
percentage
would
be
the
percentage
compiled
by
bull
moose,
by
mr.
roosevelt
when
he
was
running
in
1912,
which
i
believe
is
of
the
order
of
29%
to
30%.
the
reason
i
asked
about
how
you
define
the
third
party
is
there
are
several
other
new
parties
running
for
the
first
time
in
a
new
election
that
did
much
better
than
that.
there
are
some
if
i
can
find
my
reference
for
a
moment
such
as
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
have
not.
senator
lafollette,
got
about
9%
i
believe.
all
of
these
figures
are
--
well,
i
believe
they
are
in
the
joint
appendix
at
about
pages
34
and
35
of
volume
2
(a),
but
there
are
candidates
of
course
like
mr.
fremont,
the
republican
candidate
in
1956,
who
finished
as
the
second
candidate
in
that
year.
there
are
candidates
like
governor
wallace
in
1968
who
got
i
believe
something
like
12
½%
to
13
½
%
of
the
total
vote.
indeed
there
are
in
the
36
elections,
since
1832,
defining
small
parties
as
parties
coming
on
the
scene
for
the
first
time
or
too
small
parties.
there
are
ten
examples
in
that
table
i
referred
you
to.
it
is
pages
35
to
42
of
volume
2
(a),
ten
examples
in
36
elections
of
candidates
who
achieved
better
than
5%
so
it
is
a
no
sense
an
impossible
dream.
the
appellant’s
focus
on
the
5%
floor
based
on
votes
in
the
preceding
election
as
a
condition
of
pre-election
financing
and
based
on
votes
in
the
current
election
as
a
condition
of
post
election
financing
as
their
principal
claim
of
discrimination.
and
i
would
like
to
deal
with
that
first
from
the
standpoint
of
the
floor
itself
and
second
as
from
the
standpoint
of
the
alleged
discrimination
between
pre-election
and
post-election
financing.
these
provisions
are
attacked
as
showing
a
studied
congressional
disregard
for
the
third
parties,
but
to
the
contrary
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
that
congress
took
great
care
neither
to
favor
nor
to
disfavor
the
smaller
parties
and
it
fixed
on
the
5%
floor
and
the
other
objectively
measurable
features
of
this
plan
in
a
careful
effort
that
it
was
found
in
belief
that
it
was
following
the
guidance
of
this
court.
the
original
public
financing
measures,
you
may
recall
was
enacted
in
1966.
it
set
a
floor
of
7%
based
entirely
on
results
in
the
preceding
election.
nothing
whatever
was
provided
based
on
results
in
the
current
election.
that
law
was
suspended
by
congress
the
following
year.
in
the
next
year,
in
1968,
you
decided
williams
against
rhodes
and
in
1971,
you
decided
jeness
against
fortson
and
it
was
based
on
the
guidelines
provided
by
those
two
opinions
that
congress
in
1971,
just
a
few
months
later
enacted
the
fore
runner
of
chapter
95.
and,
the
5%
figure
was
taken
directly
as
i
said
from
jeness,
based
on
the
holding
that
before
providing
access
to
the
credit
ballot,
a
state
can
reasonably
require
a
showing
of
a
significant
modicum
of
support
and
that
5%
was
a
reasonable
flow
for
that
purpose.
and
if
you
look
at
the
report
of
the
senate
rules
committee,
proposing
that
legislation,
you
will
see
it
refers
specifically
to
jeness
and
to
williams
against
rhodes
that
it
specifically
recognizes
the
constitutional
right
of
a
minor
party
to
grow
into
a
major
political
force
and
that
it
correctly,
we
believe
said
quoting
jeness,
that
it’s
bill
did
not
freeze
the
political
status
quo.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
see
a
distinction,
justice
rehnquist,
between
the
preparation
or
between
a
standard
for
qualification
to
be
on
the
printed
ballot
perhaps
and
qualification
to
receive
federal
financing,
but
i
do
not
see
any
other
distinction
between
the
constitutional
standards
applicable
to
the
state
and
those
applicable
to
the
federal
government
or
the
need
that
either
is
trying
to
serve
in
disposing
of
frivolous
candidacies
and
doing
its
best
to
see
that
the
election
itself
does
not
suffer
from
splintering
and
serves
the
idea
of
a
two-party
system
as
long
as
it
does
not
favor
two
particular
parties.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
if
i
would
define
it
and
precisely
the
way
i
believe
the
this
court
defined
it
in
storer
against
brown,
in
american
party
against
white
and
in
others
of
state
ballot
and
state
primary
financing
cases
in
which
you
held
that
one
of
the
legitimate
public
aims
of
the
government
would
be
to
foster
some
stability
in
the
political
process
by
having
the
ultimate
election
at
least
be
one
that
was
not
an
opportunity
to
continue
the
sort
of
intra
party
fights
that
had
going
on
during
primaries
and
during
the
preparatory
process,
so
that
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
election
could
come
as
close
as
possible
to
reflecting
the
views
of
a
majority.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
i
do
not
see
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
sense
that
the
same
interest,
if
it
is
applicable
at
the
state
level
is
infinitely
more
applicable
at
the
national
level,
considering
that
many
responsibilities
on
the
national
government
and
the
interest
that
must
exist
at
the
national
level
to
not
to
have
the
problems
of
many
splinter
parties
none
of
which
has
a
majority
and
not
to
have
a
president
elected
either
by
a
plurality
or
perhaps
even
by
a
minority
of
the
electorate.
appellants
have
argued
that
the
5%
figure
upheld
in
jeness
was
less
restrictive
because
it
was
a
figure
for
a
petition
that
could
include
voters
who
had
voted
for
other
candidates
in
the
preceding
election
or
who
had
signed
other
petitions.
but
the
5%
in
this
floor
may
well
be
a
less
onerous
requirement
because
it
is
5%
of
a
much
smaller
universe.
it
is
5%
of
the
60%
or
70%
of
the
electorate
at
votes
which
is
something
in
the
national
scale
of
the
order
of
4
million
people,
rather
than
5%
of
those
registered
as
eligible
to
vote
which
must
be
well
over
5
million
because
the
number
of
eligible,
when
i
say
--
i
will
correct
myself,
not
eligible
to
vote,
registered
to
vote,
because
of
the
number
of
eligible
voters
in
1976
is
estimated
to
be
something
of
the
order
of
150
million
people
of
whom
or
probably
well
over
100
million
will
actually
be
registered.
appellants
have
not
proven
as
the
court
said
in
jeness
that
one
5%
goal
as
any
significantly
harder
to
reach
than
the
other
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
this
one
satisfies
not
only
the
test
of
jeness,
but
also
the
test
of
storer
against
brown
which
also
was
5%
of
the
votes
cast
in
the
preceding
election,
although
it
was
on
petition
basis,
but
the
court
had
trouble
with
that
level
in
storer
against
brown
not
because
it
was
5%
of
the
voters
in
the
preceding
election,
but
because
excluded
from
that
universe
or
any
people
who
had
voted
in
the
primaries,
something
that
does
not
happen
here.
we
would
also
say
that
even
if
congress
was
constitutionally
wrong
in
setting
a
5%
floor
of
votes
as
a
condition
for
public
financing
that
would
not
require
the
chapter
to
be
invalidated
in
its
entirely.
when
a
statue
discriminates
unconstitutionally
because
of
under
inclusion,
the
court
need
not
declare
that
statue
a
nullity,
but
can
extend
the
coverage
of
the
statute
to
those
who
are
grieved
by
the
exclusion
if
that
would
better
effectuate
the
legislative
purpose
and
of
course
you
did
that
last
term
in
weinberger
against
wiesenfield
in
which
you
found
it
was
unconstitutional
to
bar
social
security
coverage
for
widowers
while
giving
it
to
widows.
you
did
not
declare
it
unconstitutional
to
pay
widows,
instead
you
took
care
of
it
on
an
under
inclusion
basis
by
saying
that
widowers
also
had
to
be
paid.
applying
the
same
theory
here,
we
say
it
would
consist,
that
certainly
be
more
consistent
with
the
congressional
intent
rather
than
to
strike
down
the
entire
public
financing
scheme
to
extend
public
financing
on
a
proportional
basis
to
parties
or
to
candidates
who
garnered
less
than
5%
of
the
votes
in
the
preceding
election.
next,
the
attack
is
on
any
floor
based
on
results
in
the
preceding
election
because
it
bars
the
candidates
of
parties
falling
below
that
floor
as
well
as
candidates
of
no
parties
or
of
new
parties
from
receiving
any
public
financing
before
the
election.
they
have
not
suggested
anymore
workable
method
of
proving
before
an
election
and
then
a
significant
modicum
of
support.
the
latest
idea
that
mr.
clagett
has
put
forth
signatures
of
5%
of
the
eligible
voters
on
a
petition,
as
in
the
case
of
jeness,
we
would
say
is
highly
impractical
and
certainly
whether
or
not
congress
could
have
chosen
that
method.
one,
it
is
entitled
to
have
rejected
it.
5%
of
the
registered
voters
in
georgia
was
88,000
voters.
5%
of
the
registered
voters
in
the
united
states
as
i
indicated
earlier
is
probably
well
over
5
million
voters.
for
a
candidate
to
compile
into
the
fec
election
commission
have
to
verify
some
5
million
signatures,
voters
in
40
to
50
states
raises
enough
questions
about
cost
and
feasibility
and
jeness
according
to
the
stipulation
in
that
case
at
page
87
on
file
of
the
court,
the
cost
to
georgia
of
verifying
the
88,000
signatures
was
approximately
a
dollar
for
signature.
that
cost
was
something
like
75
to
$80,000.00
for
each
of
the
two
petitions
that
the
court
has
reasoned
that
georgia
had
recently
cleared
in
that
case.
moreover,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
the
appellants
have
failed
to
show
that
the
inability
of
those
who
fail
the
5%
test
to
obtain
pre-election
financing,
disadvantages
them
in
any
way.
of
course,
pre-election
money
would
be
better
than
post
election
money,
but
even
before
the
advent
of
major
party
financing
--
of
public
financing
i
am
sorry,
the
major
party
candidates
were
able
to
raise
pre-election
money
to
a
vastly
greater
extent
than
the
smaller
party
candidates.
and
chapter
95
is
not
going
to
change
that
differential
to
the
detriment
of
the
smaller
candidates.
in
1972,
the
republican
candidate
raise
nearly
$60
million
privately,
most
of
it
before
the
election.
the
democratic
candidate
nearly
$39
million
privately,
most
of
it
before
the
election.
even
if
you
applied
retroactively
the
rule
of
the
new
statute
against
contributions
in
excess
of
$1,000.00
and
eliminated
all
of
those
excesses
from
the
1972
figures,
each
candidate
raised
well
over
$24
million
dollars.
all
of
the
minor
party,
presidential
candidates
combined,
raise
approximately
$1
million.
1%
of
the
100
million
that
the
major
party
candidates
raised,
if
you
ignore
the
$1,00.00
ceiling
and
2%
of
what
they
raised
if
you
apply
the
$1,00.00
ceiling.
so
we
would
say
to
you
that
in
1976,
at
least
if
you
look
at
the
1972
figures,
the
small
party
candidates
and
any
no
party
candidates
certainly
are
not
going
to
be
worse
off
vis-a-vis
the
major
party
candidates
in
terms
of
pre-election
funding
because
of
chapter
95.
in
fact,
if
you
take
into
account,
the
ceilings
on
contributions
and
the
ceilings
on
expenditures,
it
looks
as
if
they
would
very
likely
be
better
off.
and
at
the
very
least
as
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
they
have
not
proven
any
real
danger
that
they
are
going
to
be
worse
off.
next,
i
would
like
to
come
to
mr.
clagett’s
point
about
the
constitutionally
required
alternative
means
for
pre-election
financing.
leaving
aside
the
distinction
between
pre-election
and
post
election
financing,
of
course,
an
alternative
means
is
provided
in
the
statute
because
a
party
which
does
achieve
the
5%
level
in
the
current
election
will
receive
post
election
money
and
i
will
get
to
mr.
clagett’s
,point
about
the
lone
distinction
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would
suppose
not
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
not
apprehend
the
argument
about
discrimination
in
the
statute
to
be
a
first
amendment
argument.
i
understand
it
to
be
a
fifth
amendment
argument.
they
are
only
first
amendment
argument
against
public
financing
is
one
which
mr.
clagett
did
not
really
address
him
self
to
in
the
oral
argument.
both
of
us
have
discussed
it
extensively
in
our
briefs.
that
is
the
claim
that
it
somehow
violates
the
establishment
language
of
the
religion
clause
of
the
first
amendment
which
he
would
move
by
osmosis
into
the
speech
and
assembly
portion
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
i
would
certainly
agree
justice
white
that
any
public
financing
scheme
or
ballot
access
scheme
which
discriminated
unfairly
against
minor
parties
or
new
parties
would
be
unconstitutional,
perhaps
it
is
just
as
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
as
under
the
fifth
amendment,
but
the
essence
of
the
showing
would
be
a
showing
of
discrimination.
and
absent
the
showing
of
discrimination,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
power
to
provide
for
the
public
welfare
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
we
are
saying
there
no
unconstitutionally
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
at
the
very
least,
there
is
recognition
of
the
differences
between
the
larger
parties
and
the
fringe
parties
just
as
there
was
recognition
of
those
differences
in
jeness
against
fortson.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would
go
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
phrase
that
sometimes
(voice
overlap)
yes,[laughter]
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes.
i
would
like
to
come
back
though
to
the
alternative
means
that
have
been
provided
for
pre-election
financing.
first,
just
as
the
court
in
jeness
found
that
this
was
one
of
the
alternative
means
there,
an
individual
aspirant
for
the
presidency,
instead
of
competing
for
the
nomination
of
a
minor
party
or
going
it
alone,
could
as
plaintiff
mccartney
did
in
1968,
compete
for
the
nomination
of
a
major
party
and
if
he
succeeds,
he
would
have
of
course
get
the
full
entitlement
of
the
funds.
if
he
prefers
the
nomination
of
the
minor
non
qualifying
party,
chapter
95
permits
its
candidate
as
well
as
those
who
are
entitled
to
some
public
financing,
but
less
than
the
full
allotment
to
continue
to
raise
private
contributions,
while
it
requires
those
who
qualify
and
except
the
full
20
million
not
to
raise
any
private
contributions.
so
that
any
small
party
or
no
party
candidate
will
demonstrate
sufficient
strength,
will
be
free
to
raise
pre-election
funds
commensurate
with
that
strength
and
as
was
noted
a
few
moments
ago,
george
wallace
did
precisely
that
in
1968.
he
raised
almost
$7
million
which
was
12
½
%
of
what
all
presidential
candidates
raised
at
a
time
when
he
accounted
for
13
½%
of
the
total
presidential
vote
and
certainly
a
lot
of
that
strength
was
visible
before
the
election
and
that
is
why
he
was
able
to
raise
the
money.
more
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
have
to
admit
justice
stewart
that
is
a
question
i
have
not
thought
of
that
any
candidate
would
have
money
spend
it
matching
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
no,
but
i
would
think
his
funds
are
his
funds
if
he
was
running
in
the
primary
and
that
they
would
be
available
to
him
thereafter
and
certainly
he
could
thereafter
running
as
an
independent
and
having
run
as
an
independent,
he
might
make
himself
eligible
for
funds
in
the
next
election.
i
would
like
to
deal
very
briefly
if
i
could
with
the
point
that
post
election
financing
is
illusory
because
it
can
only
be
used
to
repay
loans.
well,
of
course,
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
raise
money
before
the
election
on
a
contingent
loan
basis.
many,
many
contributions
so
called
are
given
in
the
form
of
loans
to
be
repaid,
if
the
candidate
is
in
a
position
to
repay
those
loans.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
loan,
a
contribution
includes
a
loan
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--
except
for
this
particular
purpose
of
defining
what
a
recipient
of
post
election
public
financing
can
spend.
he
may
repay,
use
some
of
that
money
to
repay
a
loan
and
that
loan
is
excluded
from
the
definition
of
contribution
for
that
purpose.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
right.
i
would
like
to
go
very
briefly
to
plaintiff
mccarthy
who
says
that
he
can
never
be
entitled
to
this
public
financing
he
sustains
because
he
is
not
a
party
candidate.
the
answer
to
that
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
is
there
is
no
definition
of
party
in
this
portion
of
the
statute.
he
has
a
committee
for
a
constitutional
candidacy,
i
believe
it
is
called
mccarthy
1976.
that
committee
could
very
well
be
defined
as
a
party
and
the
fec
is
holding
rule
making
proceedings
considering
that
very
issue
right
now.
i
have
not
had
time
to
get
to
the
less
restrictive
means
of
the
voucher
plan
and
the
tax
return
check
off.
i
would
like
to
discuss
them
if
i
could
just
vary
briefly.
the
voucher
plan
has
a
number
of
difficulties
of
which
the
most
significant
is
the
danger
of
block
trading
of
vouchers,
vouchers
would
be
like
money
people
could
buy
them.
they
would
also
be
very
high
administrative
cost
in
dealing
with
vouchers
worth
only
$1
or
$2
that
cost
in
collecting
those,
might
very
well
turn
out
to
be
more
than
what
they
would
be
worth
in
the
end.
so
far
as
the
check
off
for
a
candidate
of
your
choice
is
concerned,
since
the
check
offs
are
keyed
to
the
four
tax
dates,
it
is
not
even
clear
on
the
last
of
those
dates
april
15,
1976
who
the
candidates
are
really
going
to
be.
moreover,
congress
wanted
and
i
think,
again
this
was
a
legitimate
congressional
purpose
to
have
equal
allotments
of
funds
to
any
party
that
got
over
25%
in
order
as
much
as
possible
to
balance
things
out
for
a
two
or
three
party
race
in
the
next
election
and
a
candidate
of
your
choice
check
off
provision
could
not
be
accommodated
to
that
sort
of
a
system.
lastly
there
is
to
matching
suggestion
which
is
not
advocated
by
appellants
because
they
object
to
matching
on
other
grounds,
but
it
is
suggested
by
the
attorney
general
and
matching,
we
submit
suitable
as
it
maybe
for
the
primary
period
is
wholly
unsuitable
for
the
regular
election
for
the
very
same
reason
i
have
mentioned
earlier,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
for
legitimate
interest
of
either
the
federal
government
of
the
state
government
in
trying
to
develop
some
kind
of
a
majority
choice
at
federal
election.
so
a
proliferation
of
many,
many
candidates
in
the
final
election
is
something
congress,
we
say,
could
constitutionally
prefer
not
to
encourage.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
primary
system,
the
matching
for
primaries,
we
will
have
to
rely
on
our
briefs
for
most
of
that,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
not
a
single
plaintiff
before
it
who
intends
to
enter
the
primaries
or
who
has
pleaded
that
he
intends
to
do
that.
of
all
the
hypothetical
issues
raised
in
this
case,
all
put
before
you
by
non
plaintiffs
or
involving
non
plaintiffs,
the
one
least
related
to
these
particular
plaintiffs
is
entering
a
national
primary.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
certainly
the
appellants
have
raised
first
amendment
issues
which
i
did
not
cover,
namely
these
establishment
clause
issues.
that
aside,
we
would
argue
it
is
essentially
a
fifth
amendment
rather
than
a
first
amendment
question.
thank
you
very
much.
