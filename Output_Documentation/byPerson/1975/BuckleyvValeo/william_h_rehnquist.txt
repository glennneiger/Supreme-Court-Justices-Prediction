justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
winter,
how
much
can
we
get
into
a
particular
ruling
like
that.
i
mean,
senator
benson
is
not
a
party
here,
governor
wallas
is
not
a
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
tornillo
we
were
discussing
the
language
of
the
statute
as
such
as
applied
by
the
florida
courts
and
here
you
are
asking
us
to
take
into
a
considerations
a
ruling
by
the
commission
in
a
particular
controversy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
winter
is
it
your
contention
that
these
people
would
not
have
contributed,
had
they
had
to
do
so
under
a
disclosure
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
basis
for
it?
it
does
not
seem
to
me
it
is
proved
by
showing
that
because
they
could
contribute
without
any
disclosure
before
april
7th,
they
choose
to
do
that
rather
than
to
contribute
after
april
7th?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
congress
has
apparently
decided
otherwise
in
this
case?
they
have
said
that
they
do
not
want
people
to
appear
to
beholden,
even
though
the
voters
knowing
that
they
appear
to
be
beholden
would
nonetheless
elect
them.
it
that
an
impermissible
judgment
for
congress
to
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
leave
that
point,
if
we
say
$100.00
is
too
low
a
threshold,
we
would
surely
have
to
articulate
some
basis
for
our
reasoning
as
to
why
$100.00
is
too
low,
but
some
other
figure
would
be
acceptable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
should
we
include
that
in
our
opinion
that
the
congress
ought
to
think
more
carefully
about
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
should
think
if
there
is
a
problem
in
requiring
someone
who
spends
$100.00
to
disclose
it,
there
would
be
even
more
of
a
problem
in
flatly
prohibiting
a
person
from
spending
over
$1,000.00?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman
before
you
go
on,
if
your
answer
to
justice
powell
is
right,
it
is
certainly
stands
the
cases
of
this
court
on
the
subject
down
their
head
because
the
thought
had
been
that
you
could
do
to
--
you
could
prohibit
contributions
from
corporations
and
labor
unions
in
a
way
that
you
could
not
prohibit
them
from
individuals
and
now
if
you
are
right,
congress
comes
a
long
and
says
we
are
prohibiting
individual
contributions,
but
corporations
and
labor
unions
are
free
to
give
what
they
want
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
history
of
our
cases
has
been
first
to
sustain
corporate
limitations
with
the
thought
that
you
probably
would
have
a
great
deal
more
difficulty
with
individuals
and
then
to
say,
well,
you
can
treat
unions
the
same
what
you
do
corporations,
still
intimating
that
you
would
have
a
great
deal
more
difficulty
with
individuals.
and
now
you
say,
congress
has
come
along
and
stood
the
things
on
it
his
head
that
individuals
are
limited,
but
corporations
and
union
are
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
segregated
funds
are
to
be
treated
differently?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
a
reason
just
before
you
were
questioned
by
my
brother
stewart
and
brennan,
you
said
that
you
thought
the
chilling
effect
here
was
justified
by
the
interest
in
the
most
fundamental
of
all
our
rights,
the
right
to
vote.
is
it
your
position
that
the
united
states
constitution
places
the
right
to
vote
in
a
position
superior
to
the
right
to
speak
or
publish?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happens
mr.
cox,
we
have
to
limit
it
even
handedly,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
limits
the
amount
of
money
that
can
be
spent
on
political
contributions
or
on
608
(e),
the
amount
that
can
be
spent
for
individual
expressions
in
support
of
a
candidate,
but
it
does
not
limit
any
other
kind
of
expenditure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cox,
i
notice
that
distinction
in
your
brief
too.
how
about
the
ad
that
was
bought
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
well,
would
that
be
under
your
definition
of
personal
activity
or
that
just
be
money?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
i
need
the
ad.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
my
act
in
just
signing
an
ad
that
someone
else
has
prepared,
does
not
have
the
same
first
amendment
protection
as
if
i
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
ticket
that
is
carrying
a
placard
that
someone
else
wrote.
i
mean,
is
he
pretty
well
down
to
bottom
of
the
first
amendment
values?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
they
could
--
if
there
is
no
intelligible
line
to
be
drawn
then
presumably
under
your
analysis,
they
could
equally
well
have
forbidden
the
expenditure
of
more
than
a
certain
number
of
hours
of
personal
service?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
make
something
turn
on
the
point
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
this
fit
into
your
constitutional
argument?
you
say
that
unions
and
corporations
have
great
power,
but
that
by
itself
does
not
demonstrate
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
of
the
appellant
mr.
clagett
is
a
new
party
as
defined
in
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
has
no
standing
for
that
reason
to
complaint
that
somebody
else
has
get
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
he
cannot
attack
that
because
he
would
be
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cutler,
do
you
think
that
perhaps
the
state
might
have
more
latitude
than
congress
since
the
state
that
is
responsible
for
the
physical
preparation
of
the
ballot
and
the
limitation
somehow
of
the
size
of
the
ballot,
whereas
presumably
congress
does
not
face
exactly
that
problem
doling
out
money?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
interest
is
congress
pursuing
in
as
you
say
making
sure
that
thing
does
not
splinter?
i
mean,
how
would
you
define
that,
is
it
a
legitimate
or
desirable
goal
on
the
part
(inaudible)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
see
no
distinction
the
state's
role
and
congress'
role
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cutler,
in
view
of
your
contentions
about
standing,
it
becomes
fairly
important
whether
this
public
financing
question
is
regarded
as
a
first
amendment
question
or
a
fifth
amendment
question,
does
it
not,
because
ordinarily
we
would
not
apply
overbreadth
if
we
just
to
have
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
would
think
mr.
clagett
that
if
you
were
to
be
able
to
challenge
that
without
the
commission
ever
having
done
anything
to
any
of
your
clients,
you
would
have
to
validate
virtually
a
taxpayerâ€™s
action
for
the
federal
government
which
this
court
has
never
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
not
injured
not
by
the
action
of
the
commission,
but
by
congress'
action
over
turning
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
that
stems
from
the
availability
of
the
veto
and
not
the
composition
of
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
facial
constitutionality,
now
what
does
that
mean
outside
of
the
first
amendment
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
there
is
no
need
for
the
person
challenging
the
commission
to
have
been
affected
or
be
in
a
controversy
with
that
if
he
challenges
the
separation
of
powers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
he
had
a
case
decided
against
him
on
the
merits
by
the
court,
including
a
judge
of
who
may
complain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
my
question
really
is
not
so
much
to
suggest
that
you
do
not
have
an
actual
case
or
controversy,
but
why
do
you
refer
to
it
as
a
facial
attack?
if
in
the
fact
the
commission
has
harmed
you,
why
do
you
need
to
talk
about
the
facial
on
constitutionality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
is
not
--
congress
is
one
house,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
if
you
are
right
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
right
all
the
associate
justices
of
this
court
would
apparently
still
be
making
$39,000.00
a
year,
would
they
not?
i
mean,
all
the
federal
salary
act
provides
for
one
house
veto?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
glidden
against
zdanok?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
spritzer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
glidden
against
zdanok?
there
the
claim
was
it
not
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
made
an
improper
decision
for
other
reason,
but
there
was
judge
who
was
sitting
on
it
who
had
no
business
sitting
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
with
the
cases
like
united
states
against
musgrave
where
they
said
the
original
court
of
claims
could
not
be
ask
to
do
what
it
did?
that
was
a
litigant
challenging,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
there
was
no
question
in
musgrave
that
the
judges
of
then
court
acclaims
met
the
statutory
qualification,
but
this
court
held
that
was
not
enough,
there
was
constitutional
problem?
