mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
your
honors.
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
at
mr.
cutler’s
request
to
provide
an
item
of
information
in
response
to
a
question
asked
earlier
i
think
by
justice
stewart.
he
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
section
9038
(b)
(3)
which
deals
with
matter
of
unexpanded
primary
matching
funds
and
it
does
require
that
they
be
returned.
i
propose
of
course
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
commission
and
of
the
powers
that
has
been
accorded
it
by
the
legislation.
and
we
do
think
as
justice
rehnquist’s
questions
have
highlighted
that
there
is
a
question
of
standing
with
respect
to
this
part
of
the
case
which
does
lie
at
the
threshold
and
does
have
to
be
addressed
here.
by
and
large
appellants
accept
the
view
that
if
this
commission
had
been
appointed,
all
of
its
members
by
the
president,
that
it
would
be
able
to
exercise
the
powers
that
have
been
accorded
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
maybe
an
exemption,
excuse
me
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
did
your
honor,
but
i
think
at
least
the
fundamental
objection
to
this
commission’s
legitimacy
is
they
put
it
into
it
having
particular
powers
and
i
shall
come
to
this
veto,
legislative
veto
point
also.
i
think
their
fundamental
concern
is
the
claim
that
this
violates
the
president’s
constitutional
prerogatives
to
appoint
officers
of
the
united
states.
and
our
point
as
to
that
is
that
it
is
hard
to
see
how
appellants
have
standing
to
act
here
as
the
president’s
champion
because
this
is
a
question
which
goes
solely
to
the
allocation
of
the
appointed
power
within
the
federal
establishment.
there
is
no
question
here,
that
all
of
these
commissioners
meet
the
statutory
qualifications
and
when
mr.
clagett
says
that
commission
is
engaging
in
various
forms
of
regulation
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
supports
an
attack
upon
the
legitimacy
of
the
commission
because
the
allocation
of
the
appointive
power
is
between
the
president
and
the
congress
is
not
designed
for
the
protection
of
the
public
at
large
or
taxpayers
or
of
citizens
and
of
course
there
is
remedy
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
insofar,
your
honor
is
they
are
claiming
that
any
action
by
the
commission
violates
a
power
that
an
agency
can
exercise
or
that
the
commission
has
gone
beyond
the
statute,
i
fully
agree.
insofar
as
the
challengers
bait
solely
on
the
proposition
that
the
appointments
were
made
by
the
president,
i
think
we
have
a
quite
different
question.
a
question
much
like
ex-parte
letter
in
which
a
member
of
the
bar
sought
to
challenge
a
justice
of
this
court
on
the
ground
that
appointive
process
was
defective.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh!
i
have
question
for
a
moment
your
honor
that
this
commission
has
functions
to
perform
and
if
any
of
the
actions
which
it
takes
or
orders
it
issues
or
regulations
which
it
should
promulgates
are
unconstitutional
for
reasons
apart
from
the
question
as
to
the
allocation
of
the
appointive
power
that
they
can
be
raised.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
can
raise
any
question
going
to
the
constitutionality
of
action
taken
by
the
commission
which
effects
him.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
quite
so
and
i
think
the
court
was
at
pains
to
point
out
in
glidden
that
the
provision
for
life
tenure
is
for
the
benefit
of
litigants
and
that
that
was
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
standing
that
the
a
party
is
required
only
to
raise
his
own
interests
and
not
a
claim
that
somebody
else's
prerogatives
have
been
impinged.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i
think
the
litigant
could
challenge
just
as
he
could
challenge
the
failure
of
a
judge
to
have
life
tenure
in
glidden,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
but
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
commissioners
here
meet
the
statutory
qualifications.
the
sole
claim
is
that
by
adopting
the
method
of
appointment
that
it
did,
congress
impinged
on
executive
prerogatives.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
certainly
do
not
stand,
though
i
think
it
is
essential
to
raise
it
since
it
is
a
jurisdictional
question
on
the
standing
question
alone
and
indeed
there
are
three
propositions
that
i
hope
to
develop
in
my
remaining
time.
the
first
proposition
is
that
article
2,
section
2,
clause
2,
the
section
of
the
constitution
dealing
with
the
appointment
power
is
not
preclusive
of
congressional
authority
to
make
appointments
to
offices
where
it
appears
that
the
function
of
those
officers
is
substantially
related
to
a
constitutional
responsibility
of
the
congress.
the
second
proposition
we
hope
to
develop
is
that
the
congress
has
unique
and
pervasive
responsibilities
which
are
not
confined
solely
to
passage
of
legislation
in
relation
to
the
federal
electoral
process.
and
that
leads
us
to
the
third
proposition,
that
the
powers
which
have
been
accorded
to
this
commission
that
an
examination
of
them
shows
that
they
are
substantially
related
or
incidental
to
those
constitutional
responsibilities
of
the
congress.
it
is
true
of
course
that
article
2
does
provide
for
appointment
of
officers
of
the
united
states
by
the
president.
it
then
does
go
on,
however,
in
the
but
clause
with
which
your
honors
are
familiar
to
state
that
congress
made
by
law
vest
the
appointment
of
such
inferior
officers
as
they
think
proper
in
the
president
alone
in
the
courts
of
law
or
in
the
heads
of
departments.
and
we
think
it
is
fairly
implicit
in
that
section,
at
least
when
it
is
read
in
the
light
of
constitutional
history
and
practice
and
the
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
that
though
congress
is
not
expressly
granted
the
same
power
--
