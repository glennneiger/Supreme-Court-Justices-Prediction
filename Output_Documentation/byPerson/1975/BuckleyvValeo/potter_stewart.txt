justice
potter
stewart
some
of
these
limitations
are
annually,
you
can
spend
that
much
in
any
one
year,
is
that
true
of
all
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
to
specific
by
the
general
explanation
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
am
correct
in
my
understanding
that
some
of
them
do
permit
annual
expenditures
or
contributions
of
that
amount?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
am
just
asking
a
question?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
have
a
federal
election
every
two
years?
justice
potter
stewart
the
presidential
every
four
and
congressional
every
two?
justice
potter
stewart
still
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
year.
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
geared
to
federal
election?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
in
anytime
during
the
federal
election
years.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
--
are
you
directing
yourself
to
the
fifth
amendment
attack
or
first
amendment
attack
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
does
not
have
much
to
do
with
discrimination
as
such
does
it?
the
fifth
amendment
does,
of
course?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
advice
is
directed
to
the
content,
it
certainly
does.
justice
potter
stewart
well
accept
for
it
is
being
very
awkward
and
unwieldy
perhaps
and
maybe
impractical
to
sweep
so
broadly,
how
constitutionally
does
it
differ?
how
constitutionally
it
is
a
greater
violation
of
john
jone's
rights
to
private
associational
confidentiality,
if
his
$125.00
expenditures
needs
to
be
recorded?
how
is
that
a
greater
violation
than
it
is
of
mr.
mott’s
or
mr.
stone's
rights,
if
as
you
concede
congress
could
enact
a
statutory
provision,
requiring
that
he
make
a
disclosure
of
his
million
dollar
contribution.
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
other
question
now
that
interrupted
you.
you
said
you
be
quite
satisfied
if
the
--
with
what
would
be
left
after
the
court
accepted
your
position
and
struck
down
these
disclosure
provisions,
what
would
be
left
vis-a-vis
disclosure,
nothing,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
would
you
say
you
would
be
quite
satisfied
with
what
would
be
left
with
respect
to
the
disclosure
requirements
after
we
struck
down
that
you
tell
us
we
should
strike
down,
that
is
after
we
have
held
that
the
constitution
makes
it
impermissible.
there
were
be
nothing
left
with
respect
to
any
disclosure
requirements,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gora,
i
guess
i
missed
something
and
perhaps
i
did.
i
think
neither
you
nor
mr.
winter
specifically
separated
and
identified
section
608
(e)
for
special
attention,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
it
is
not
you
painted
with
a
very
simple
brush,
it
a
much,
it
is
considerably
more
subtle
than
though
you
describe
it
to
us,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
people
often
make
contributions
to
a
candidate
who
expresses
the
donors
views.
they
do
not
go
out
and
buy
them,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
as
simple
at
least,
through
a
little
more
subtle
than
you
describe,
you
would
conceived
that,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
is
the
same
amount
of
money,
it
is
the
same
as
though
that
donor
made
no
contribution
at
all,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
mr.
friedman
maybe
mistakenly
that
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
the
limitations
of
the
present
statute
would
extend
to
the
kind
of
committees
permitted
under
our
pipefitters
construction
of
section
610.
the
question
being
whether
or
not
they
would
be
so
called
“committees”
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
is
their
difference?
is
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
the
applicability
of
the
existing
statute
to
the
kind
of
organizations
that
my
brother
powell
was
referring
to?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
would
there
be
committees
on
the
existing
limitation
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
footnote
in
another
brief,
that
i
cannot
locate
at
the
moment,
takes
issue
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
mr.
friedman
is
in
that
brief
that
i
have
now
located
the
footnote
to
which
i
earlier
referred,
it
is
footnote
124
on
page
107
and
the
accompanying
text,
that
takes
issue
with
the
government'
amicus
brief
on
pages
36
and
37
in
the
accompanying
footnotes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
speech
and
speeches
money
whether
to
be
buying
television
or
radio
time
or
newspaper
advertising
or
even
buying
pencils
and
papers
and
microphones,
that
is
certainly
clear,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
insofar
as
it
used
to
buy
people
to
vote,
that
is
covered
by
other
criminal
statutes,
so
were
obviously
not
talking
about
the
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
tried
by
other
and
older
criminals’
statutes
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
purchasing
of
votes
given
--
justice

and
the
question
is
whether
those
so
called
subtle
influences
are
influences
protected
by
the
constitution
of
the

states,
specifically
amendment
one
there
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
again,
just
phrase
down
mr.
friedman.
you
did
not
precisely
separately
discuss
section
608
(e),
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
only
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
608
(e),
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
limit
only
a
certain
kind
of
political
speech,
now,
whether
not
that
maybe
helpful
to
you,

if
he
wants
to
understand
section

(e),
he

justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
you
said
that
you
would
agree
or
you
would
believe
that
if
the
limits
were
set
lower
that
there
could
be
a
point
where
they
were
i
permissively
low
as
a
constitutional
matter,
is
that
your
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
limits
on
what
contribution
and
expenditures
be
low
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
disclosure?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
which
would
be
just
as
constitutional,
would
it
not,
in
your
submission
to
require
disclosure
of
a
$1.00
contributor
as
it
would
be
a
million
dollar
contributor,
so
far
as
the
constitution
goes?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
there
is
a
greater
invasion
with
respect
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
invasion
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
large
contributor
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
winter,
we
were
told
by
mr.
cox
and
perhaps
others
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
individual
50
states
have
analogs,
statutory
analogs
to
the
disclosure
provisions
of
this
legislation
and
to
the
limitations,
provisions
of
this
legislation
both
upon
contributions
and
expenditures.
do
you
know
--
are
there
any
state
analogs
to
608
(e)?
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
disclosure
primarily
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
limitation?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
said
that
you
know
of
at
least
one
state
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
to
the
predecessor
of
608
(e)?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
matching
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
different.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
for
ballot
position,
ballot
access?
justice
potter
stewart
has
nothing
to
do
with
financing
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
extent
that
the
states
do
publicly
finance
their
elections?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
republican
party
of
mississippi?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
republican
party
under
the
statute
had
been
a
new
party
in
1860,
when
abraham
lincoln
first
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
he
would
never
have
got
in
1865,
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
of
your
reply
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
differentiation?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
mr.--
are
you
directing
yourself
mr.
cutler
to
the
situation
where
a
candidate
runs
in
let
us
say
democratic
party
primaries
in
the
various
states?
well,
some
runs
well
and
some
runs
badly
in
others
and
then
at
the
democratic
national
convention
he
is
not
nominated
and
then
that
same
man
decides
to
run
as
a
no
party
person,
an
independent
person,
what
happens
to
the
matching
funds
that
he
has
collected
as
a
primary
candidate
if
they
are
unexpended?
justice
potter
stewart
money
spent
(inaudible)
speculative
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
this
is
taking
us
back
to
the
subject
to
this
morning.
are
these
limitations
on
contributions
and
on
expenditures,
contributions
particularly,
do
they
cover
loans
or
do
they
deal
with
loans?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does.
justice
potter
stewart
just
for
that
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
clagett,
this
constitutionally
equivalence
simply
to
in
appropriation
by
a
congress
from
the
general
funds
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
stands
for
this
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
the
check
off
really
constitutionally
have
to
do
with
this?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
one
of
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
not
the
essence
of
majoritarian
government,
mr.
clagett
to
have
congress
appropriate
money
for
variety
of
different
purposes
that
many
taxpayers
think
is
quite
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
i
understand
from
your
brief
at
least
that
you
say
that
even
assuming
there
could
be
a
non
discriminatory
system,
it
is
nonetheless
unconstitutional,
violative
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
beside
and
before
you
get
that
you
say
what
is
considered
to
be
a
legislative
agency?
you
say
it
is
a
legislative
agency.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
its
membership,
because
of
who
appoints
its
member
or
majority
with
this
membership?
justice
potter
stewart
functions
which
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
plenary
of
the
majority
of
its
members
are
appointed
by
the
congress
to
ex-officio
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
agents
of
congress
are
members?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
four
others
out
of
the
total
of
eight
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
six
voting
numbers
are
appointed
by
the
congress,
that
is
one
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
then
the
other
reason
you
said
is,
it
is
because
congress
has
an
absolute
veto
of
everything,
anything
it
does?
justice
potter
stewart
anything
important
it
does?
justice
potter
stewart
about
the
candidate
presidency
who
is
not
a
native
born
citizen
of
the
united
states,
natural
born,
excuse
me,
natural
born
citizens?
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
commission
is
doing
something
to
restrict
anyone
of
these
plaintiffs,
indeed
then
surely
the
plaintiffs
have
standing
to
attack
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
commission
and
they
are
not
being
champions
of
the
president,
they
are
being
champions
self-appointed,
if
you
will,
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
this
court
have
not
done
anything
to
that?
