justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
out
before
the
senate
and
house
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
something
else
about
the
case,
about
the
presidency
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
states
have
disclosure
provisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
the
bulk
of
those
be
vulnerable
in
your
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
constitutionally
the
state
case
will
come
out
differently
that
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
should
pick
out
some
figures
and
some
threshold
figures
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
the
congress
decided
what
the
amendments
are
going
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
apparently
thought
that
this
would
be
enough
money
for
anybody
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
difference
that
you
might
give
to
a
congressional
judgment
in
how
much
money
it
might
be
appropriate,
it
may
not
be
the
same
if
when
we
are
talking
about
how
much
incumbents
thought
can
challengers
might
need.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
apparently
is
what
you
already
given
that
they
saw
in
history,
incumbents
would
not
do
any
better
than
challengers?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
least
and
intelligible?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
winter,
what
do
you
suggest
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
this
statute?
i
understand
perfectly
well
what
you
think.
whatever
it
was
trying
to
do
was
unconstitutional.
what
do
you
think
it
was
trying
to
do?
i
suppose
we
must
accept
the
--
what
on
its
face
it
seems
it
was
trying
to
do.
it
was
aimed
at
limiting
corruption,
i
supposed.
do
you
say
it
was
aimed
at
something
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
explaining
why
--
tell
me
what
do
you
it
was
trying
to
do
if
it
was
not
trying
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
probably
do
not
have
to
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
do
not
know
i
think
it
--
do
you
accept
the
goal
that
the
congress
was
aiming
at
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
time
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
not
need
--
you
say
congress
was
not
really
seriously
attempting
to
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
limitations
on
expenditures
or
contributions
you
would
not
accept
those
as
any
serious
effort
by
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
through
court
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
alternative
suggestions
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
expenditure
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
they
have
resisted.
the
incumbents
were
just
riding
themselves
into
a
permanent
seat,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
cure
your
problems
if
the
minor
parties
or
the
new
parties
were
not
subject
to
the
contribution
limits?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
expenditure?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
contribution
limits?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
fifth
amendment
had
question
take
on
a
different
aspect
if
you
are
in
the
voting
--
in
election
area
in
terms
of
what
you
have
to
--
what
the
government
might
have
to
show?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
saying
that
there
is
discrimination
that
is
testified,
you
are
saying
that
no
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
some
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
there
is
discrimination
and
you
say
there
is
reason
enough
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
street
suggest
that
a
labor
union
could
not
solicit
from
its
members
contributions
for
political
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
did
it
suggest
that
if
it
did
solicit
for
political
purposes
it
can
only
spend
it
for
the
particular
candidates
that
individual
contributors
designated?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
the
dues
that
law
required
them
to
collect?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
not
just
some
voluntary
item.
it
was
--
because
the
force
of
law
was
behind
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
certainly
has
not
consented
to
the
legality
use
for
political
--
to
subsidize
political
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
person
who
checks
it
off,
however,
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
consented.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
other
people
complain
because
there
had
not
been
a
check
off,
this
would
be
in
the
general
fund.
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
elseâ€™s
taxes
are
being
reduced?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
insofar
as
it
relates
to
enforcement?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
if
it
where
an
executive
agency,
but
the
congress
retained
the
power
to
veto
a
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
answer?
what
do
you
say
the
answer
should
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
the
congress
gives
an
agency
power
to
strike
out
the
statute
by
a
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
congress
says
we
want
you
to
submit
it
to
us
first
to
see
if
it
really
conforms
with
our
legislative
intent?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
the
president
and
the
president
cannot
require
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
president
could
not
require
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
independent
agency
could
not
require
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
submit
some
regulation
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
our
rules,
maybe
the
rules
of
procedure
of
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judicial
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
legislative
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
give
me
one
example
of
what
has
the
commission
done
to
you
specifically,
which
in
so
doing
represents
a
legislative
rather
than
an
executive
function,
whereas
in
executive
function
or
the
legislative
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
name
me
one,
name
me
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
that
would
be
no
difference
in
a
regulation,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
really
--
so
you
put
that
in
a
same
category
as
the
congress
retaining
the
power
to
pass
on
a
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
no
worse
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
any
closer
to
sort
of
an
enforcement
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
that
has
not
done
any
of
these
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
investigative,
the
enforcement
investigative
functions?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
legislative
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
a
claim
mr.
spritzer
of
saying
that
this
is
a
legislative
body
that
can
do
some
things,
but
it
has
many
jurisdiction
to
perform
some
of
the
functions
that
are
assigned
to
it
and
some
of
the
functions
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
perform?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
being
exercise
against
these
plaintiffs?
