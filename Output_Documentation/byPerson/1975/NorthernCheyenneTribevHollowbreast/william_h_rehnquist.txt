justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
congress
could,
in
the
68
act
it
simply
it
said
that
we
are
giving
the
reserve
mineral
rights
to
the
tribe
and
if
that
is
a
taking
the
allottees
can
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
or
sue
in
the
district
court.
i
take
it
congress
would
have
had
that
part
of
the
fact
that
they
provided
that
the
68
act
would
be
void
if
interest
had
actually
vested,
suggest
that
congress
is
perhaps
more
concerned
in
that
case
than
it
might
have
been
in
others
as
to
whether
there
had
are
been
a
vesting.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
had
retroactive
application
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
also
if
congress
proceeded
to
simply
take
it
from
the
allottees,
the
allottees
remedy
is
only
to
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
for
compensation
as
i
understand
the
law
that
they
cannot
say
that
the
act
would
have
not
effect.
