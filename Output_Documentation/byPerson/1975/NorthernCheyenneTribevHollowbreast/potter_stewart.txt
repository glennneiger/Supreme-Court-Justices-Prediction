adverse
to
your
position.
justice
potter

but
the
interior
department
clearly
agreed
to
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
chestnut
you
gave
us
the
specific
legislative
history
of
the
1926
act
and
pointed
out
the
petition
beginning
on
page
56
of
the
appendix,
addressed
to
senator
walsh
and
the
later
reluctance
in
somewhat
grudging
agreement
of
the
bia
and
the
interior
department
to
the
allotment,
the
last
allotment
made
in
1926.
what
is
the
specific
history
of
the
1968
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
by
the
tribe.
justice
potter
stewart
whole
national
policy
had
changed
vis-Ã -vis
the
indians,
had
it
not?
for
many
years,
beginning
on
the
1880s
i
guess
enough
through
1926-1930,
the
whole
thrust
had
been
to
break
up
the
tribes
to
turn
indians
into
people
under
white
farmers
and
then
beginning
in
about
1930,
there
is
a
180
degree
change
in
the
whole
thrust
was
to
preserve
the
tribes
and
not
to
try
to
immigrate
indians
into
white
society.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
not
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
1968
legislation
reflected
the
then
current
philosophy
as
the
best
way
to
treat
with
indians,
i.e.
by
preserving
their
tribes,
their
tribal
ownership,
their
tribal
organization,
their
tribal
governments
and
their
tribal
property
by
an
stark
contrast
of
what
had
been
the
policy
of
the
united
states
for
some
50
years
beginning
in
the
1880s,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
did
not
mean
is
that
right
i
mean
is
that
that
correct?
we
do
not
argue
that
what
is
right
and
wrong.

last
vestige
of
it
that
it
was
changing
then.
justice
potter
stewart
and
much
more
limited
in
allotment
and
much
more
grudging
one
on
the
part
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
the
one
phase
that
is
absent
is
the
one
that
we
brothers
on
the
other
side
emphasized
in
the
all
of
these
other
cases
and
in
most
of
this
other
similar
phraseology,
there
is
always
that
reservation
unless
otherwise
provided
by
active
congress
and
that
is
absent
here.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
really
that
the
key
in
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
be
in
a
much
more
comfortable
position
however
would
not
you,
if
that
language
were
in
this
1926
act,
unless
otherwise
provided
by
active
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
the
68
amendment
is
not
unconstitutional
because
by
its
very
term,
it
is
inoperative,
is
it
not,
if
the
court
should
decide
that
there
was
a
property
interest
created
in
1926?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
it
would
be
viably
null
and
void.
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
61
amendment
do,
had
to
do
with
the
timber,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
soul
inquiry
in
this
case
is
what
congress
did
or
did
not
do
in
1926,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
one
of
the
1868.
justice
potter
stewart
the
battle
of
the
little
bighorn
was
1878
or
76?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
i
am
asking
you
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
battle
of
the
little
bighorn
was
when?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
northern
cheyenne
were
involved
in
that,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
a
few
miles
west
of
where
this
reservation
is.
justice
potter
stewart
very
close
and
very
near.

tongue
river
get
in
here?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
those
figures
evolve?
you
have
told
us
--
you
said
at
the
beginning
that
tribe
self
already
has
62%
of
these
minerals,
and
the
individual
allottees,
even
if
you
are
right,
38%
only,
i
that
right?
and
how
does
that
come
about?
justice
potter
stewart
only
38%
of
the
surface
was
ever
allotted
to
them.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
representation?
