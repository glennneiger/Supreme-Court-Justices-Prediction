white
what
did
the
most
recent
act
do?
it
did
more
than
just
to
extend
the
time,
did
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
possibility
that
the
allottee
would
ever
have
a
unified
ownership
is
eliminated
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
this
is
--
this
goes
farther
than
just
insuring
that
the
mineral
interest
will
be
utilized
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
mineral
interests
were
fully
developed
in
the
next
25
years,
the
tribe
would
still
own
the
mineral
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
congress
could
have
the
power
to
change
it
back
now?
suppose
you
prevail
in
this
case,
could
congress
next
year
change
it
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
patents
were
issued
as
of
the
allottees?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
up
to
25
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
long
does
the
trust
last?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think
the
congress
could
extend
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
difference
between
that
in
this
mineral
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
restrain
still
remain.
