mr.
steven
chestnut
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
steven
chestnut,
counsel
for
petitioner,
the
northern
cheyenne
tribe.
there
is
one
issue
before
the
court.
that
issue
arises
from
the
fact
that
in
1926
congress
enacted
a
statute,
the
northern
cheyenne
allotment
act,
which
made
limited
allotments
of
surface
land
on
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation,
withheld
minerals
under
those
allotted
surface
lands
from
allotment
and
announced
a
plan
to
transfer
those
minerals
50
years
in
the
future.
in
1968,
congress
amended
that
statutory
provision
to
withdraw
the
aspect
of
the
statute
which
announced
the
plan
to
make
a
future
transfer
of
minerals
and
instead
left
the
minerals
in
the
perpetual
ownership
of
the
tribe.
precise
issue
before
this
court
is
did
the
1926
statutory
plan
for
the
future
transfer
of
minerals,
endow
the
allottees
or
their
heirs
or
devisees
with
a
vested
right
to
the
consummation
of
that
future
transfer.
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
i
think
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
i
think
the
statute
actually
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
no,
it
did
not
use
the
word
plan,
that’s
true
your
honor.
mr.
steven
chestnut
that
is
right.
the
statute
used
the
term
that
the
mineral
shall
become
the
property
of
the
allottees
in
50
years,
right.
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
it
can
be
taken
as
a
term
of
in
futuro
and
i
think
that
when
you
take
it
with
the
following
word
‘become’,
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
intent
was
that
the
property
right
would
come
into
existence
in
50
years.
moreover
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
no,
i
think
it
has
a
--
it
connotes
the
concept
of
future,
a
future
event
and
i
think
moreover
that
the
circumstances
giving
rise
to
the
act
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
the
subsequent
administrate
execution
of
the
act,
more
or
less
contemporaneous
with
its
enactment
subsequent
to,
but
contemporaneous
clearly
show
that
the
full
understanding
of
the
statute,
by
the
administrators
charged
with
the
duty
of
enforcing
it
and
by
the
legislators
who
enacted
it,
was
that
no
property
right
was
then
being
created
and
i
will
go
into
that
into
my
argument.
i
think
moreover
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
giving
rise
to
the
enactment
namely
the
request
by
the
northern
cheyennes
themselves
that
they
receive
in
allotment
act,
clearly
shows
that
the
northern
cheyennes
themselves
neither
desired
nor
expected
that
they
would
be
acquiring
a
property
right
to
the
minerals
with
the
enactment
of
that
act.
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
the
justice
department
at
the
trial
court
level,
district
court,
represented
one
of
the
named
respondents
in
the
case,
one
of
the
defendants.
mr.
steven
chestnut
adverse
to
our
position,
yes.
that
representation
continued
through
the
ninth
circuit.
subsequently
mr.
littlebird
who
was
the
client
of
justice
department,
based
on
his
experience
on
the
reservation,
concluded
that
it
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
northern
cheyennes
for
tribal
ownership
of
all
the
minerals
and
requested
a
discontinuance
of
their
representation
because
of
that.
mr.
steven
chestnut
interior
department
supports
us
entirely
and
believes
not
only
the
congress
had
the
power
to
enact
the
1968
amendment
but
moreover
that
its
enactment
is
vital
to
the
future
survival
of
this
indian
tribe
and
this
unique
group
of
people.
our
position
of
course
is
that
the
1926
statute
created
no
vested
rights
in
that
future
distribution
and
that
congress
retained
inherent
continuing
power
to
amend
that
aspect
of
the
allotment
act.
looking
particularly
to
the
four
constituent
elements
of
the
legislative
and
administrative
process
giving
rise
and
surrounding
this
enactment,
one
finds,
i
think
complete
support
for
our
position
that
no
property
right
was
presently
transferred
at
that
time.
firstly,
the
circumstances
giving
rise
to
the
enactment
shows
that
the
federal
allotment
policy
itself
commenced
more
or
less
in
the
end
of
the
1870s
was
formalized
in
1887
with
the
enactment
of
the
general
allotment
act
and
the
basic
theory
was
that
the
solution
to
the
indian
problem
would
be
to
divide
up
tribal
ownership
into
individual
ownership.
and
pursuant
to
that
policy
individualized
allotment
acts
were
enacted
for
a
host
of
reservations.
the
brother
reservations
of
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation,
the
state
of
montana
received
allotment
act
very
early
under
that
policy,
the
fort
belknap
reservation
in
1888,
the
flathead
reservation
in
1904,
the
crow
reservation
in
1904,
the
blackfeet
reservation
in
1907
and
the
fort
peck
reservation
in
1908.
yet
by
1926
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation
was
not
yet
allotted
in
any
sense
and
had
received
no
allotment
statute.
the
reasons
for
this
arose
from
two
factors,
one,
the
view
of
the
administrator
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
administering
indian
affairs,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
that
the
northern
cheyenne
people
themselves
and
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation
physically
was
not
be
suitable
for
allotment.
the
other
factor
was
that
by
the
early
1920s,
a
severe
reassessment
of
the
allotment
policy
was
underway
and
in
fact
there
was
substantial
public
and
official
skepticism
about
the
utility
of
the
allotment
policy.
in
particular,
the
department
of
interior
felt
that
the
northern
cheyenne
people
were
backward
or
have
a
long
history
of
resistance
to
the
white
civilization
and
were
not
suitable
for
the
“civilizing
benefits”
of
allotment.
moreover
the
department
felt
that
the
reservation
itself
was
not
physically
suitable
for
allotment
because
it
was
a
grazing
reservation
and
the
allotment
theory
was
really
a
farming
theory.
so
there
was
substantial
official
resistance
to
allotting
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation.
this
coupled
with
the
emergence
in
the
1920s
of
the
critical
reassessment
of
the
allotment
policy
made
for
offer
great
resistance
within
the
government
to
allotting
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation.
in
fact,
the
1926
allotment
act
that
was
enacted
for
the
northern
cheyennes
was
the
last
original
allotment
act
ever
enacted
by
congress.
moreover,
these
circumstances
gave
rise
to
unique
allotment
act,
an
act
far
more
limited
than
any
other
allotment
act
which
congress
had
ever
enacted.
the
typical
pattern
for
an
allotment
act
in
all
of
these
other
montana
reservations
and
the
osage
reservations
and
throughout
the
country
was
basically
a
substantial
distribution
of
the
entire
corpus
of
tribal
property.
provisions
were
made
for
ailing
ability
of
distributive
property
and
as
a
result
i
might
add
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
official
reassessment
of
the
allotment
policy,
90
million
acres
of
indian
lands
were
lost
from
indian
ownership
and
in
fact
today
in
the
state
of
montana
if
one
looks
around
one
will
find
that
these
allotted
reservations
are
substantially
either
in
white
ownership
on
in
white
use.
however,
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation,
because
of
the
unique
allotment
act,
is
in
98%
indian
ownership,
is
in
99%
indian
use,
85%
of
the
population
of
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation
is
northern
cheyenne
and
this
is
directly
traceable
to
the
unique
and
limited
nature
of
that
allotment
act.
in
any
event,
the
northern
cheyennes
wanted,
they
were
concerned
that
their
reservation
rested
only
on
an
executive
order
and
that
they
therefore,
the
tribe
as
a
whole
therefore,
did
not
have
a
vested
confirmed
property
interest
in
that
reservation.
so
they
wanted
a
congressional
enactment
which
would
confirm
tribal
ownership
of
that
executive
order
reservation.
secondly,
they
wanted
limited
allotments,
so
that
they
have
a
plot
of
land
on
which
they
could
build
homes.
those
were
the
two
central
functions
of
the
allotment
act.
the
third
function
was
to
make
sure
that
the
natural
resources
of
that
reservation
remained
in
tribal
ownership,
to
be
developed
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people.
the
allotment
plan
itself,
the
allotment
statute
announced
what
i
maintain
as
a
plan,
a
statutory
plan
to
transfer
the
mineral
interest
under
allotted
lands
at
the
end
of
50
years
on
the
theory
that
the
50
year
period
would
be
adequate
for
development
of
that
mineral
resource.
it
turned
out
because
of
external
facts
that
the
mineral
wealth
of
the
reservation
was
not
developable
within
that
50
year
period
and
in
1968
congress
amended
the
act
to
implement
the
central
intent
of
the
1926
congress
that
the
mineral
wealth
of
the
reservation
inure
to
the
benefit
of
all
the
people.
in
any
event,
in
february
of
1925,
the
people
themselves
submitted
a
petition
to
congress
requesting
the
enactment
of
the
allotment
act.
the
petition
was
submitted
to
their
senator,
senator
thomas
walsh
and
the
petition
was
very
short,
it
is
at
page
56
of
the
appendix.
it
was
signed
by
490
members
of
the
tribe
which
according
to
my
conservative
calculation
was
58%
of
the
adult
membership
of
the
tribe
at
that
time.
the
cover
letter
that
submitted
this
petition
indicated
that
absolutely
no
opposition
had
been
received,
had
been
indicated
on
the
reservation
to
the
concept
of
this
petition
and
the
petition
is
very
short,
in
three
paragraphs.
the
first
paragraph
says
that
the
people
want
an
allotment
of
tillable
farm
land.
the
second
paragraph
which
is
crucial
to
the
resolution
of
this
case
says
that
these
people
want
the
following
“to
reserve
all
mineral,
timber
and
coal
lands
for
the
benefit
of
the
northern
cheyenne
indian
tribe
said
tribe
to
have
absolute
control
of
same.”
that
event
and
that
petition
is
what
kicked
off
the
legislative
process
for
the
formulation
of
an
act
which
i
submit,
petitioners
submit,
conforms
to
this
expressed
desires
and
expectations
of
the
people
on
the
reservations.
mr.
steven
chestnut
i
did
not
hear
the
last
part
of
the
question
sir.
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
i
think
that
what
congress
did
in
the
statute
was
in
two
places
in
unprecedented
fashion,
make
very
broad
reservations
of
power
over
the
entire
allotment
plan
and
the
statute.
other
allotment
acts
like
the
crow
allotment
act
and
these
other
montana
allotment
act
and
the
osage
allotment
act
which
basically
were
massive
assault
on
the
tribal
system,
had
very
specific
reservations
of
power.
and
i
think
the
question
maybe
directed
to
an
argument
advanced
by
respondents
that
the
northern
cheyenne
did
not
have
a
specific
reservation
of
power.
the
northern
cheyenne
had
an
overall
or
encompassing
reservation
of
power
which
i
submit
was
in
complete
conformity
with
the
central
intent
of
congress
which
was
that
we
are
relinquishing
trust
responsibility,
we
are
not
taking
part
of
this
reservation
apart,
we
are
maintaining
the
federal
control
and
we
are
doing
a
very
little
limited
thing.
now
with
high
insight,
it
might
have
been
good
to
enumerate
every
aspect,
the
federal
control
that
was
being
retained
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
those
things
are
hard
to
do.
so
i
guess
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
i
think
--
perhaps
this
will
be
responsive.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
law.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
not
have
to
reserve
any
particular
power
to
alter
executory
unconsummated
aspects
of
that
statute.
it
is
a
matter
of
law
and
i
think
congress
was
operating
in
1926
on
the
basis
of
a
body
of
decisions
of
this
court
interpreting
allotment
for
legislation,
which
established
that
congress
has
inherent
authority
to
alter
allotment
distributions.
in
fact,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
crow
allotment
act,
in
a
supplement
to
the
crow
allotment
act,
the
1920
provision,
there
was
a
debate
on
the
floor
of
congress
about
whether
or
not
it
was
necessary
for
congress
to
specifically
reserve
a
power
to
extend
a
period
of
the
minerals
reservation,
and
the
statement
on
the
floor
of
congress
in
connection
with
that
precise
question
was
it
is
not
necessary.
we
have
inherent
authority
to
do
that
and
i
think
that
is
completely
supported
by
the
cases.
mr.
steven
chestnut
yes.
i
will
do
that
right
now.
the
respondents
argue
that
by
extending
or
perpetuating
the
tribal
ownership
of
minerals,
the
mineral
state
in
the
tribe
is
thereby
subjected
to
state
taxation
under
a
separate
federal
statute
and
that
that
constitutes
a
divestment
of
tribal
property
in
favor
of
the
state.
there
are
number
of
answers
to
that
which
i
have
set
forth
in
the
reply
brief,
but
i
will
try
to
recall
the
basic
ones.
number
one,
that
is
really
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
did
respondents
have
a
vested
property
right
which
congress
could
not
take
away?
respondents
by
this
argument
tried
to
bootstrap
themselves
basically
into
this
standing
of
the
tribe
and
say
that
the
tribe
is
losing
some
kind
of
vested
property
right.
really
it
is
outside
the
issues
in
this
case,
it
is
inappropriate
argument,
the
basic
question
here
is
did
the
1968
amendment
take
away
some
vested
property
right
of
respondents?
secondly,
the
tax
statute,
which
is
25
u.s.c.
section
398c,
which,
respondents
argue,
would
subject
this
tribal
state
to
state
taxation,
is
in
fact
not
applicable
to
this
indian
reservation.
that
statute
is
applicable
purely
to
executive
order
reservations
and
under
a
decision
of
this
court,
british-american
case,
which
i
believe
was
decided
in
1939,
it
was
held
that
an
indian
reservation
which
would
base
initially
an
executive
order
and
subsequently
receive
congressional
--
congressionally
conformed
by
statute
is
not
an
executive
order
reservation
within
the
meaning
of
that
tax
statute.
thirdly,
i
think
the
argument
of
respondents
is
really
inherently
circular.
if
they
are
contending
that
the
tax
statute
398c
subjects
the
tribal
mineral
state
to
taxation
during
this
perpetuated
ownership
period,
and
that
that
was
a
taking,
then
certainly
that
statue
was
a
taking
when
it
was
enacted
in
1927.
that
tax
statute
was
enacted
in
1927
after
tribal
title
in
the
entire
reservation
was
confirmed
by
congress;
the
tribe
had
a
whole
lot
of
vested
property
right
at
that
point.
therefore,
if
the
statute
by
taxing
tribal
lands
as
a
taking,
it
was
a
taking
at
that
point
and
that
theory
is
not
applicable
either.
moreover,
the
northern
cheyenne
act
itself,
the
allotment
act
specifically
provides
that
leasing
of
tribal
minerals
would
be
conducted
under
1938
statute,
this
was
incorporated
in
a
subsequent
amendment,
and
that,
we
submit,
makes
this
1927
statute
inapplicable.
there
are
other
arguments
which
i
will
not
go
through
but
we
have
made
them
all
in
our
reply
brief.
the
petition
of
the
northern
cheyenne
people
was
submitted
in
1924
and
the
legislative
process,
we
submit,
conformed
completely
to
the
expressed
desires
and
hopes
of
the
people.
the
department
of
interior
grudgingly
responded
with
an
allotment
bill
which
was
very
limited
as
i
have
indicated
uniquely
limited,
specifically
reserved
minerals
from
allotment
and
specifically
allotted
only
surface
lands
for
agricultural
and
farming
purposes.
and
finally,
upon
enactment
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
the
final
form
of
the
act,
the
house’s
response
over
the
bill,
representative
levitt
indicated
that
the
act
--
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
make
allotments
so
that
the
individual
northern
cheyennes
could
“have
permanent
homes
and
develop
their
own
farms.”
moreover
he
indicated
that
the
act
“offers
a
means
for
the
development
of
any
mineral
resources
such
as
oil
which
is
maybe
discovered
on
the
reservation
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.”
lastly,
he
indicated
that
the
act
“gives
the
indians
the
fullest
possible
benefit
of
their
natural
resources.”
the
50
year
provision
was
a
provision,
there
is
no
explicit
mention
of
the
genesis
of
that
50
year
provision
in
the
legislative
record,
but
i
think
the
fair
reading
of
the
entire
legislative
history
is
that
the
purpose
of
that
provision
was
to
ultimately
unify
title
after
the
mineral
reserve
was
developed.
finally
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
the
1968
act
which
was
the
amendment
at
issue
in
this
case,
extended
tribal
ownership
in
perpetually.
it
eliminated
other
provision
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
that
is
correct,
and
this
was
based
--
the
initial
version
of
the
act
in
fact
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
the
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
that
is
correct.
now,
the
reason
that
it
was
made
a
perpetual
extension
was
because
the
department
of
interior
pointed
out
to
congress
that
the
essential
purpose
of
this
amendment
was
to
fulfill
the
1926
intent
and
to
provide
for
full
development
of
the
mineral
wealth
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
as
a
result,
they
indicated
that
there
was
--
the
intent
of
congress
was
not
to
transfer
anything
of
substantial
value
to
the
allottees.
it
pointed
out
moreover
that
after
a
full
development
--
if
a
full
development
period
were
allowed
by
that
point
in
time
the
airship
situation
on
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation,
which
is
already
somewhat
complicated,
17%
of
the
respondent
class
is
neither
northern
cheyenne
and
in
some
cases
not
indian.
that
if
the
reservation
were
extended
for
an
additional
finite
period
of
time,
50
years
or
100
years,
the
airship
situation
would
be
impossible.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
nothing
of
value
was
intended
to
be
transferred
at
that
point,
there
was
really
no
utility
in
imposing
upon
the
department
of
interior
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
tremendous
problem
of
sorting
out
the
airship
difficulties.
so
that
was
the
genesis
of
the
perpetual
extension.
in
short
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
absolutely,
yes.
it
would
be
tribal
property
and
the
congress
has
complete
authority
to
provide
for
distribution
of
tribal
property
to
tribal
members
under
its
plenary
authority.
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
this
act
immediately
after
its
enactment.
the
allotments
will
consummated
after
1926,
between
1926
and
1934
by
the
issuance
of
allotment
patents.
these
patents
made
a
blanket
reservation
of
all
minerals
and
natural
resources
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
it
contained
no
mention
of
the
50
year
transfer,
no
covenant
to
make
a
50
year
transfer.
in
short,
there
was
no
basis
from
the
document
itself
for
the
northern
cheyennes,
to
believe
and
in
fact
they
did
not
believe
or
expect
or
hope
for
that
they
would
be
acquiring
a
property
interest
in
these
minerals.
thus,
as
a
result
of
the
enactment
of
the
1926
act
and
the
issuance
of
the
patents,
what
did
the
allottees
have
in
the
way
of
indicia
of
property
in
this
mineral
resource.
plainly
and
simply,
all
they
had
was
a
statute
which
announced
the
plan
to,
in
the
future,
create
a
property
interest.
they
had
no
power
to
transfer
that
future
property,
that
future
interest,
whatever
it
may
be.
they
had
no
power
to
profit
from
it
directly
by
their
own
transactions.no
power
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
that
future
provision
in
the
statute.
moreover,
they
had
no
physical
control.
they
had
no
power
of
enjoyment.
the
1926
act
lodged
leasing
authority
over
the
entire
mineral
resource
in
the
tribal
council
and
provided
that
all
proceeds
of
mineral
development
on
the
reservation
would
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
northern
cheyenne
people
as
a
whole,
would
be
deposited
in
the
united
states
treasury,
and
would
be
expended
for
the
benefit
of
the
northern
cheyennes
as
congress
might
deem
expedient.
lastly,
this
future
interest
that
these
allottees,
this
expectancy
that
these
allottees
had
after
1926
was
subject
to
the
tribe’s
complete
power
to
exhaust
that
reserve
and
moreover,
to
the
statutory
provision
which
said
that
the
proceeds
of
such
development
of
that
reserve
would
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
tribe.
so,
it
is
not
possible
to
identify
any
conventional
index
of
property
arising
from
either
the
1926
act
or
the
allotment
patents
issued
subsequently.
moving
now
to
the
strict
legal
question
of
what
the
state
of
the
law
with
regard
to
the
power
of
congress
to
alter
executory
unconsummated
portions,
of
statutory
plans
for
the
distribution
of
tribal
property
to
tribal
members,
the
decisions
of
this
court
starting
most
prominently
in
1912
with
the
decision
gritts
versus
fisher
and
then
a
whole
string
of
decisions
up
to
the
recent
decision
of
united
states
versus
jim
in
1972
consistently
and
uniformly
reaffirm
that
the
statutory
plan
which
contemplates
a
future
distribution
is
amendable,
alterable,
repealable
by
congress
in
light
of
changing
conditions
and
the
best
interest
of
the
indians.
that
power,
in
those
cases,
is
founded
on
this
court’s
perception
that
it
is
crucial
to
congress’s
historic
and
constitutional
function
to
serve
indians
and
indian
property,
that
congress
maintain
authority
over
the
tribal
property
of
tribal
indians.
and
furthermore
that
that
authority
is
essential
for
the
implementation
of
federal
policy.
it
is
found
that
on
the
notion,
a
legal
notion
that
no
right,
no
individual
right
in
tribal
property
arises
until
the
tribal
property
is
actually
distributed.
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
i
think
that
is
the
point
which
the
ninth
circuit
seized
upon
and
which
respondents
argue
that
congress’s
formulation
of
the
1968
amendment
indicates
some
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
congress.
i
think
that
first
of
all,
that
particular
uncertainty
at
that
point
does
not
completely
mesh
with
congress’s
prior
view
of
the
statute
and
this
legislative
statute.
in
1961,
congress
amended
this
allotment
act
to
make
very
substantial
encumbrances
upon
this
expectancy
of
the
allottees.
first
of
all,
it
provided
that
the
tribe
could
enter
into
minerals
leases
which
would
extend
indefinitely.
in
effect
it
took
away
the
right,
assuming
there
was
a
right,
in
these
allottees
to
themselves
transact
independently
of
the
tribe
with
respect
to
this
future
interest.
secondly,
the
statute
added
the
term
‘devisees’
to
the
class
of
future
beneficiaries
of
this
mineral
right.
it
provided
--
the
original
act
provided
that
the
future
interest
will
be
transferred
to
the
allottees
or
their
heirs,
in
1961
congress
said
the
allottees,
their
heirs
or
devisees.
in
1961,
therefore,
in
the
case
of
an
original
allottee
who
had
died
prior
to
1961
and
asked
to
whom
they
had
been
ascertained
an
existing
heirs.
those
heirs
by
that
1961
amendment
were
supplanted
by
devisees,
my
point
being
that
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
absolutely,
yes.
moreover
the
1961
statute
specifically
said
that
any
prior
transfers
of
that
future
interest
by
the
allottees
or
their
heirs
was
null
and
void,
and
that
any
future
transfers
within
the
remainder
in
50
year
period
would
be
null
and
void.
my
point
is
that
the
conservatism
in
1968
was
not
evident
in
1961
and
i
think
the
basic
reason
for
the
conservatism
was
a
concern
that
an
awareness
that
this
mineral
reserve
was
quite
valuable
and
a
concern
that
united
states
not
in
fact
be
subjected
to
this
kinds
of
claims
of
damages
which
you
refered
to
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
was
a
concern
to
absolutely
eliminate
any
possibility
that
the
united
states
would
be
liable
in
damages
and
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
felt
it
had
the
power
to
do
it
but
out
of,
what
i
would
consider
excessive
and
inconsistent
concern,
it
incorporated
this
very
unusual
provision.
finally,
i
would
like
to
make
the
point
that
this
exercise
in
1968
of
congress’s
inherent
power
to
amend
this
statutory
provision
was
--
in
the
facts
involved
here
was
entirely
--
and
proves
the
premise
on
which
it
is
based,
which
is
that
congress
needs
that
power.
by
1968,
the
coal
reserve
on
this
reservation
had
been
undeveloped.
the
reservation
was
in
the
poverty
stricken
state,
the
northern
cheyenne
culture
was
intact,
the
people
were
still
speaking
northern
cheyenne,
they
still
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
reservation
was
still
a
home
land
for
a
unique
fragile
culture.
suddenly
the
coal
became
commercially
desirable,
the
entire
reservation
is
underlaying
with
it.
but
shortly
53%
of
that
reserve
would
be
lost
through
this
plan.
in
that
instance,
individual
allottees
who
were
lucky
enough
to
rest
atop
valuable
coal
would
become
rich
and
other
allottees,
members
of
the
tribe
who
were
not
that
lucky
would
stay
poor.
there
would
be
haves
and
have
not
on
reservation.
moreover,
the
ownership
situation
would
have
been
fractionated
into
an
impossible
situation
with
this
complicated
airship
problem.
there
would
be
impossible
marketing
conditions,
there
would
be
absentee
ownership.
you
would
have
in
--
37%
of
this
class
consist
of
people
who
do
not
live
on
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation.
the
respondents
include
people
in
honolulu,
in
san
francisco,
in
seattle,
in
florida,
in
bayonne,
new
jersey.
these
people,
under
this
statutory
plan,
would
be
making
decisions
regarding
strip
mining
of
a
substantial
portion
of
this
reservation.
finally,
the
minority,
the
impact
of
such
development
were
likely
to
make
the
northern
cheyennes
a
minority
in
their
own
homeland
and
devastate
this
virgin
reservation
which
had
absolutely
no
industrial
development.
congress
acted
n
1968
to
prevent
to
lodge
in
the
tribal
council
which
after
all
is
the
representative
of
all
the
people
and
moreover
which
has
pursued
this
1968
legislation
since
1966
and
has
for
a
10
year
period
through
five
administrations
on
this
reservation
democratically
elected
by
all
the
people
and
here
to
the
notion
that
it
is
crucial
to
the
survival
of
these
people
that
the
tribal
council
and
the
people
as
a
whole
have
control
of
this
resource.
in
light
of
those
circumstances
congress
amended
the
act,
i
think
this
proves
the
fundamental
soundness
of
what
we
submit
as
an
established
legal
principle
that
congress
must
have
and
does
have
that
inherent
authority
to
alter
plans
for
future
distribution.
thank
you.
mr.
steven
chestnut
the
specific
history
of
the
1968
legislation
is
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
congress
became
aware
that
suddenly
this
coal
reserve
was
for
the
first
time
commercially
developable,
that
the
tribe
was
going
to
lose
control
of
it
in
a
short
eight
years,
that
there
would
be
a
situation
of
desperate
wealth
on
the
reservation
as
a
result
you
would
have
people
remaining
in
intense
poverty
and
people
suddenly
becoming
rich.
i
think
it
probably
--
it
is
not
explicit
in
the
legislative
history,
the
point
i
am
going
to
make
now,
but
i
think,
no,
that
is
explicit,
what
i
have
just
stated
is
explicit.
mr.
steven
chestnut
yes.
this
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
by
the
tribe
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
wanted
to
spread
the
benefits
of
any
mineral
development
equally
among
all
members
of
the
tribe.
mr.
steven
chestnut
yes.
mr.
steven
chestnut
that
is
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
not
completely.
i
do
not
think
it
is
accurate
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
it
is
not
completely
correct
in
reference
to
the
northern
cheyenne
act
of
1926
which
was
i
think
not
a
product
of
what
had
previously
been
the
view
that
tribal
ownership
should
be
distributed
as
we
pointed
out
i
think
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
absolutely,
and
in
fact,
it
was
the
last
vestige
of
it
and
the
act
itself
daze
the
earmarks
of
the
fact
that
this
was
far
different
and
that
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
absolutely,
in
any
attempt
to
compare
this
act
and
draw
inferences
about
this
act
with
respect
to
other
prior
allotment
acts
which
had
the
effect
of
taking
a
reservation
and
taking
it
apart,
and
distributing
and
--
mr.
steven
chestnut
absolutely,
and
providing
for
competency
provision
and
then
taking
the
tribal
treasury
and
distributing
it
is
totally
unsound.
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
i
would
like
to
comment
on
that
if
i
may.
mr.
steven
chestnut
well,
i
have
looked
very
carefully
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
genesis
of
those
phrases
in
other
act
in
particular
the
osage
act
has
a
phrase.
one
will
find
and
this
is
detailed
in
the
reply
brief,
one
will
find
that
that
proviso
was
ultimately
included
and
left
out
of
the
osage
act.
the
osage
act
was
enacted
in
1906,
it
has
a
proviso
of
the
sort
you
are
thinking.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
shows
that
the
proviso
only
applied
to
a
portion
in
fact,
to
the
coal
reserve.
in
any
event,
congress
subsequently
extended
that
coal
ownership
in
1921
to
a
date
certain
without
reserving
any
further
power
to
extend
it
further.
nevertheless,
in
1929,
congress
came
along
and
extended
it
to
yet
another
date
certain
and
this
time
re-introduced
a
proviso
that
it
was
incorporating
reserve
power.
in
the
crow
act,
there
was
specific
statement
on
the
floor
of
the
house
in
reference
to
this
proviso
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
preserve
what
was
really
congress’s
inherent
power,
and
i
think
the
history
of
the
formulation
of
the
crow
act
shows
that
the
proviso
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
an
inherent
power
but
arose
from
a
disagreement
between
the
house
and
the
senate
of
whether
the
25
years
or
50
years
was
the
right
initial
period.
it
arose
from
a
compromise
not
over
a
generic
inherent
power
of
congress
but
over
whether
or
not
the
initial
period
should
be
25
years
or
50
years.
i
think
that
those
provisions
on
their
face
maybe
impressive
but
when
you
go
behind
them,
when
you
take
a
look
at
the
actual
legislative
history
which
gave
rise
to
their
creation
and
when
you
take
a
look
at
the
basic
act
that
they
arise
and
then
compared
to
the
basic
act
of
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation,
you
can
give
no
real
credence
to
that
provision.
it
is
ludicrous
frankly
to
think
that
congress
intended
to
relinquish
thrust
the
responsibility
in
its
enactment
of
the
northern
cheyenne
allotment
act
which
it
did
not
relinquish
in
taking
apart
these
other
reservations
clearly.
mr.
steven
chestnut
i
think
my
respondents
would
not
have
the
argument
that
they
seem
to
rely
so
heavily
on
but
i
emphasize
that
i
think
it
is
not
a
sound
argument.
