mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
this
real
issue
here
gentlemen,
i
believe,
is
he
is
the
indian
of
citizen
or
is
he
not?
are
we
going
to
permit
him
to
own
property
or
are
we
not?
i
thought
the
issue
was
settled
by
this
high
court
way
back
in
1912,
in
choate
versus
trapp
and
there
has
been
at
least
eight
more
decisions
from
that
time
confirming
that
same
position.
it
is
the
respondent’s
position
and
they,
i
might
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact,
owned
only
38%
of
the
surface
of
the
entire
reservation,
the
tribal
corporation
already
owned
68%
of
the
minerals.
the
allottees
have
a
mere
38%
left,
but
i
am
going
to
direct
the
courts
attention
to
the
treaty
of
1868,
which
i
think
is
the
first
indicia
of
governmental
intent
as
to
what
the
allottees
would
seek
to
take
in
the
treaty
which
was
entered
into
under
threat
of
force
of
arms,
because
martial
law
had
been
declared.
colonel
chivington
slaughtered
the
northern
cheyenne
men,
women
and
children
at
sand
creek,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
northern
cheyenne
and
arapaho
retaliated.
in
1865,
martial
law
was
declared
and
under
threat
of
force
of
arms
the
treaty
of
1868
was
entered
into
by
the
tribe
with
the
government.
under
that
original
treaty,
the
cheyenne,
to
induce
them
to
lay
down
their
arms,
were
promised
a
permanent
reservation
and
the
allottees
were
promise
threats
of
land
in
the
amount
of
320
acres.
after
that
another
slaughter
took
place.
a
bare
three
months
after
that
treaty
was
proclaimed
to
be
the
law
of
the
land,
the
cheyenne
and
the
sioux
were
again
slaughtered
men,
women
and
children.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
yes
sir.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
i
am
speaking
of
the
battle
of
washita.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
battle
washita,
it
followed
the
--
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
1876.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
june
25th,
1876.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
yes
sir,
but
that
came
after
the
slaughter
of
washita
came
three
months
following
the
proclamation
of
the
treaty
and
they
had
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
select
their
lands,
and
it
was
after
that,
that
colonel
custer
then
went
to
the
black
hills
on
that
expedition,
which
final
resulted
in
the
battle
of
the
bighorn
in
1876.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
yes
sir.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
yes
sir.
now,
in
their
original
1868
treaty,
the
indians
were
promise
a
choice
of
three
places.
one
was
in
oklahoma,
one
was
elsewhere,
but
one
was
in
the
south
eastern
tip
on
montana,
on
the
yellowstone,
on
otter
creek
at
crow
agency.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
the
tongue
river
is
on
the
cheyenne
reservation
your
honor
at
presently
and
i
believe
it
was
also
mentioned
there.
but
the
fact
remains
that
this
was
the
original
governmental
intent
to
vest
the
indians,
the
individual
indians
which
tracts
of
land
in
the
amount
of
320
acres.
then
in
1926
came
the
act,
giving
them
only
180
acres.
finally,
the
government
said
by
executive
order,
president
chester
a.
arthur
gave
them
a
reservation.
this
was
enlarged
by
president
mckinley
in
1900.
finally,
in
1926
came
the
allotment
act.
now
congress
said,
well,
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
320
but
i
will
tell
you
what
we
will
do
we
would
give
you
180
acres
and
they
did
so
under
that
act.
it
is
the
respondents’
position
that
they
were
entitled
to
320,
but
in
the
event
that
the
treaty
had
no
significance
whatsoever
and
that
is
what
petitioner
alleges,
he
wants
this
court
to
ignore
completely
the
1868
treaty,
which
was
the
first
time
the
northern
cheyenne
had
seeded
any
lands
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
here
they
laid
down
their
arms
and
seeded
over
51
million
210
thousand
acres
in
return
for
these
promises
which
were
never
kept.
this
is
shocking
gentlemen.
the
1926
act
at
least
gave
them
half
of
what
they
promised.
now,
the
tribe
says,
the
tribal
corporation
with
62%
of
the
mineral
says,
well,
we
still
do
not
have
enough.
so
the
united
states
of
america
and
acts
the
1968
amendment
to
the
1926
act
and
says
now,
we
gave
you
the
minerals
not
for
50
years
but
in
perpetually,
that
should
certainly
give
you
enough
time
to
remove
all
the
minerals.
i
have
always
been
talk,
you
revert
the
principle,
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
made
right
in
practice,
if
it
is
wrong
in
principle.
and
there
is
no
way
that
the
petitioner
can
convince
me
and
i
certainly
hope
cannot
convince
this
court
that
this
is
justice.
if
it
were
remain
minerals,
i
certainly
wanted
to
divide
it
among
someone
else
and
my
clients
do
not
want
their
minerals
divide
it
among
the
tribe
who
had
already
have
62%.
there
are
certain
rules
that
can
--
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
because
the
original
surface
of
the
reservation
was
divided
that
way.
when
the
allottees
were
given
their
allotments
--
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lewis
e.
brueggemann
yes
sir.
there
are
certain
rules
of
construction,
i
think
this
court
will
concede
that
are
applicable
to
both
treaties,
statutes
and
executive
orders
and
one
of
those
is
that
they
must
be
construed
in
in
pari
materia.
in
another
words,
the
court
must
consider
all
this
things,
the
treaty,
the
statute,
the
executive
orders
because
they
all
involved
the
same
subject
matter
and
it
is
certainly
the
individual
and
not
the
tribal
corporation
that
is
in
most
need
of
the
protection
of
this
court.
in
any
contract,
it
is
the
words
of
the
contract
itself
that
govern
and
not
what
may
have
preceded
or
what
might
have
been
as
petitioner
would
have
this
court
believe.
he
says
the
policy
of
congress
was
in
a
flux,
about
to
change,
i
do
not
see
that
this
is
material
at
all.
it
was
not
changed.
the
policy
of
the
congress
at
that
time
had
been
the
same.
especially
where
the
cheyenne
were
concerned
from
the
treaty
of
1868
until
the
enactment
of
the
1926
act
itself,
and
that
was
to
give
the
allottees
an
undisputable
fee
title
of
the
state.
the
1926
act
excluding
and
ignoring
the
treaty
as
petitioner
would
have
this
court
do
says
that
the
tribe
is
to
have
the
minerals
for
50
years.
well
the
tribe
sat
on
their
rights
for
50
years
and
did
nothing
and
did
not
dig
out
these
minerals.
and
it
says,
at
the
end
of
50
years
that
the
minerals
shall
become
the
property
of
the
allottees,
heir
and
devisees.
well,
he
wants
it
now.
it
is
this
year,
he
is
been
waiting
for,
he
wants
it
now.
there
was
no
qualifying
phrase
as
there
were
in
five
other
allotment
acts
that
all
preceded
the
northern
cheyenne
allotment
act..
starting
in
1902
or
06,
all
the
way
up
until
the
1926
act,
five
prior
acts
and
petitioner
would
have
this
court
believe
that
the
congress
just
dropped
the
phrase.
he
just
forgot
or
he
added
at
some
play
else
when
he
makes
reference
to
not
allotted
lands
but
un-allotted
lands,
tribal
lands,
yes.
united
states
retains
plenary
power
over
tribal
lands,
but
he
did
not
say
that
about
allotted
lands,
and
here
i
think
is
the
crucial
salian
point.
this
is
where
the
congress
can
be
said
to
have
intended
just
as
the
government
intended
in
the
original
1868
treaty
to
convey
to
the
indian,
his
minerals.
the
indian
has
been
kept
gentlemen,
a
psychological
cripple
for
many-many
years.
he
now
wants
to
determine
where
he
is
going
and
when,
and
if
you
reverse
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
is
clearly
indicate
that
choate
versus
trapp
is
controlling,
you
will
set
the
indian
back
200
years.
thank
you.
