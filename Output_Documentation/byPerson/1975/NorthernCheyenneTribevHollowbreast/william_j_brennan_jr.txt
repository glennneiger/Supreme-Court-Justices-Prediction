jr.
the
other
case
northern
cheyenne
tribe
versus
hollowbreast
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
1926
northern
cheyenne
allotment
act,
reserved
coal
and
other
mineral
deposits
underlying
lands
on
the
reservation
allotted
to
the
indians,
reserved
those
mineral
deposits
for
tribe's
benefits,
but
provided
that
50
years
from
the
effective
date
of
that
act
which
would
be
in
this
year
1946,
the
minerals
would
become
the
property
of
the
respective
allottees.
in
1968,
however,
when
of
these
coal
deposits
became
very
valuable,
congress
amended
the
1926
act
to
give
the
tribe
the
right
to
the
minerals
in
perpetuity
and
a
question
arose
whether
the
original
1926
act
had
given
the
allottees
a
vested
interest,
which
congress
without
paying
just
compensation
could
not
deprive
them
as
it
sought
to
do
by
the
1968
amendments.
the
district
court
in
this
held
that
the
allottees
had
not
been
given
any
vested
interest
by
the
1926
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
and
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
