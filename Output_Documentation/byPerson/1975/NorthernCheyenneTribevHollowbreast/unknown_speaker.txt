i
gather
justice
agreed
with
your
position
initially,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
chestnut
if
you
were
representing
the
other
side
and
wanted
to
be
sure
that
they
had
a
vested
interest,
would
you
have
drawn
the
statute
any
differently?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
drawn
the
statute
any
differently?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
i
do
not
get
an
answer
of
my
question.
unknown
speaker
somewhere
along
the
line,
would
you
comment
on
your
oppositionâ€™s
argument
about
state
tax
results?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bunch,
do
you
concede
that
during
this
period
the
federal
government
could
have
arranged
lease
or
however
you
want
to
call
it,
for
the
removal
of
the
coal
and
substantially
depleted
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
your
arguments
about
vesting?
unknown
speaker
so
the
reminder
interest
subject
to
complete
depletion.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
much
of
an
interest,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
vesture
of
any
of
remainder
interest
of
wasting
asset
that
you
find
out
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
any
remainder
interest
or
reversionary
interest
in
wasting
asset
maybe
valueless
or
may
not
be
but
that
does
not
affect
the
legal
validity
of
the
interest,
does
it?
