mr.
steven
l.
bunch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
as
stated
in
this
case
is
whether
the
1926
allotment
act
conferred
a
vested
remainder
type
interest
in
the
allottees
and
their
heirs.
if
the
26
act
did
create
such
an
interest
then
of
course
the
68
amendment
is
unconstitutional
as
a
divestment
of
that
interest
without
compensating
for
it.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
well,
the
way
it
causes
was
it
where
it
was
if
they
found
it
to
have
a
vested
interest
which
would
have
make
the
government
liability
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
right.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
that
is
why
the
section
2
i
believe
of
the
68
act
was
put
in
there,
which
specifically
required
the
tribe
to
bring
this
suit
and
required
title
in
the
minerals.
we
submit
that
like
--
since
congress
was
so
concerned
that
they
specifically
mandated
this
lawsuit
to
make
sure
they
were
going
to
get
stuck
with
this
judgment.
in
the
case
that
they
were
pretty
concerned
that
they
were
stepping
beyond
their
lawful
powers
in
passing
the
68
amendment
and
i
feel
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
viewing
congress’s
intent
in
passing
the
68
amendment.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
that
is
not
before
the
court;
it
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
the
61
amendment
did
not
divest
the
allottees
of
their
interest.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
there
are
several
of
them
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
right.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
not
if
they
were
to
give
the
allottees
their
royalties,
i
presume
once
their
state
became
possessory.
i
assume
there
would
be
analogies
to
remainderman
in
a
life
of
estate,
a
situation
or
estate
for
terms
of
years
and
that
once
the
remainderman’s
interest
that
attach
that
they
would
have
to
get
the
royalties
from
the
development.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
right,
but
there
are
constitutional
problems
under
the
61
act
in
broadening
the
class
of
people
who
are
eligible
and
included,
i
believe
devisees,
the
other
ones
had
to
do.
and
to
that
extent,
there
are
constitutional
problems
with
the
61
act.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
well,
i
am
not
really
that
familiar
with
the
history
of
the
61
amendment,
however
the
68
amendment
was
considerable
concern
with
the
prospect
of
divesting
this
interest.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
concern
was
there
and
the
problem
of
broadening
the
class
of
beneficiaries
in
61
act
or
not.
so
i
really
cannot
comment
on
the
congressional
intent
of
the
61
amendment.
in
any
way
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
right,
right.
that
was
they
intended
in
that
shall
become
property
of
language
in
section
3
of
the
allotment
act.
we
feel
that
this
did
not
create
a
vested
remainder
type
interest
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
it
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
26
act
which
i
have
outlined
in
pages
33
through
35
of
my
brief,
and
if
this
legislative
history
indicates
the
congress
knowingly
intended
to
currently
vest
the
remainder
interest
in
the
allottees
and
their
heirs,
our
construction
of
this
language
is
that
it
permitted
a
currently
vesting
but
delayed
possession
of
the
mineral
state.
we
feel
this
is
soul
because
most
of
the
congressional
considerations
of
this
bill
took
place
in
the
senate
committee
on
indian
affairs
and
they
substantially
re-wrote
the
bill
and
we
feel
that
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
bill
as
it
went
into
this
committee
and
as
it
emerged
from
the
committee
you
can
get
an
idea
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
with
this
bill.
as
the
allotment
of
the
minerals
went
into
this
committee
it
provided
that
they
will
not
quote
only
the
surface.
now
this
only
the
surface
language
could
be
intended
to
as
the
congressional
intent
that
they
intended
to
allot
only
the
surface
presently
and
that
they
intended
to
delay
allotting
the
minerals
that
led
--
they
intended
to
delay
any
vesting
of
the
minerals.
however,
the
committee
specifically
rejected
that
language
and
they
gave
this
remainder
type
interest
to
the
allottees
in
equivocal
terms.
there
were
no
contingencies
apart
from
the
passage
of
the
50
year
term
and
that
--
it
is
not
really
the
contingency
as
such
as
i
understand
and
anyway
they
rejected
the
language
which
would
be
fairly
strong
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
position
and
rejected
that
and
gave
the
allottees
their
interest
in
unequivocal
terms.
also
i
will
point
out
that
the
grant
to
the
allottees
heir
is
mandatory.
as
was
mentioned
earlier
the
language
says
“shall
become”
and
this
has
been
interpreted
to
be
mandatory
language
and
was
not
leaving
the
grant
to
the
discretion
of
congress.
i
submit
that
the
term
shall
being
a
future
tense
term
refers
to
the
shall
--
the
possession
being
future
tense
not
the
vesting
being
future
tense.
also,
it
is
interesting
to
compare
the
northern
cheyenne
allotment
act
with
other
allotment
acts
as
was
mentioned
earlier,
when
congress
choose
to
extend
--
to
reserve
the
power
to
extend
tribal
ownership,
they
specifically
did
so,
they
expressly
included
provisions
in
the
grant
of
the
minerals
and
said,
the
minerals
will
be
held
by
the
tribe
for
x
number
of
the
years
then
passed
to
the
allottees
but
they
always
include
the
all
important
proviso
unless
otherwise
provided
by
congress.
it
is
for
the
crow
reservation,
the
fort
belknap
reservation,
blackfeet
reservation,
the
osage
reservation,
the
standing
rock
reservation
and
cheyenne
river.
standing
rock
and
cheyenne
river
are
one
reservation;
the
standing
rock
and
cheyenne
river
reservation,
and
all
these
allotment
acts
were
passed
prior
to
the
26
allotment
act
period
issue.
thus
this
unless
provided
otherwise
that
congress
had
become
a
standard
form
proviso,
whenever
interior
or
whoever
is
drafting
these
bills,
wanted
to
reserve
this
power,
they
just
included
this
clause
in
the
statute.
however,
they
did
not
do
it
in
this
instance.
and
we
submit
that
this
indicates
a
congressional
wish
not
to
reserve
this
power
and
not
to
delay
the
ordinary
vesting
process.
and
according
to
the
ordinary
vesting
process
in
allotment
acts,
the
allottees’
rights
and
interest
in
that
allotment
vest
when
he
files
his
allotment
application
in
the
bureaus
of
indian
affairs
office,
and
since
the
remainder
interest
in
the
mineral
state
was
allotted
as
of
that
time,
the
rights
of
the
allottee
to
his
remainder
interest
in
the
mineral
state
vested
when
he
filed
his
application
in
the
local
bia
office
in
lame
deer
or
pro-agency
or
wherever
he
filed.
the
timing
of
the
vesting
is
according
to
this
court’s
decisions
in
arenas
versus
us,
raymond
bear
hill
and
allotment
rights
in
fort
belknap,
san
juan
county.
also,
in
the
petitioners’
reply
brief,
they
bring
up
the
point
that
many
of
our
authorities
regarding
the
allottees
vesting
of
the
rights
have
to
do
with
overriding
executive
discretion
and
not
congressional
statute.
however,
there
are
several
of
these
decisions
which
do
override
their
congressional
statute
which
intent
to
abrogate
the
allotment
rights.
for
instance,
the
allotment
rights
in
the
fort
belknap
decision
was
the
department
of
the
interior
decision
in
which
the
indian
allottee
had
filed
application
for
allotment.
the
trust
allotment
had
not
been
issued
and
the
wheeler-howard
act
took
effect,
the
wheeler-howard
act
said
no
more
allotment
--
we
will
have
no
more
allotment
of
tribal
land
therefore
this
was
congressional
statute
which
said
there
would
be
no
more
allotments
issued..
however,
department
of
interior
said
he
had
filed
his
application
prior
to
that
time,
so
despite
this
provision,
the
wheeler-howard
act,
we
are
going
to
issue
the
trust
patent
in
any
way.
also,
raymond
bear
hill
was
factually
similar
situation
in
which
he
had
filed
his
allotment
application,
there
was
a
--
and
within
the
pathway
identical,
the
one
here
at
issues
was
said
that
tribe
get
the
minerals,
and
the
department
of
interior
said,
well
he
filed
his
application
before,
this
act
of
the
fed
reserve
(ph)
in
the
minerals
of
the
tribe,
therefore,
they
would
issues
the
trust
patent,
giving
the
minerals
to
raymond
bear
hill.
also,
the
allotment
rights
in
the
san
juan
county
is
very
similar.
also
the
petitioner
claims
that
there
are
broad
reservations
of
power
in
the
1926
allotment
act
it
maybe
helpful
given
in
these
context
they
actually
set
out
in
its
entirety
at
the
beginning
of
the
appendix
to
examine
the
sections,
as
i
mentioned
each
section
and
discuss
each
section.
the
first
reservation
of
power
is
a
very
broad
reservation
of
power,
well,
we
would
also
like
to
mention
that
on
the
normal
period
of
vesting
that
the
vesting
on
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation
would
have
had
taken
place
by
1934
between
1926
and
34
because
of
wheeler-howard
act.
in
june
of
34
did
terminate
the
allotment
rights
where
we
have
no
exact
dates
on
when
these
rights
vested,
it
would
have
had
been
in
that
period.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
oh
yes.
during
the
50
year
period,
the
government
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
the
allottees
would
have
taken
whatever
is
left
over.
during
the
50
year
period,
the
tribe
could
exploit
the
coal
and
in
theory
they
could
lose
nothing
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
right.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
well,
that
is
not
the
way
it
turned
out.
it
is
possible
that
they
could
have
taken
nothing
by
it
but
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
right,
any
oil
interest
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
that
nullifies
the
interest
as
such.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
right!
anyway,
the
first
reservation
of
power,
the
petitioner,
claims
allows
the
--
before
i
mention
this
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
that
a
specific
reservation
of
power
here
is
necessary
that
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
interior
thought,
it
was
necessary
to
include
this
unless
provided
by
the
congress
proviso
when
all
you
have
the
statutes.
if
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
more
surplus
each,
in
fact
interior
came
back
time
and
time
again
and
it
included,
would
indicate
that
it
was
necessary
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
originally
trust
patents.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
the
trust
patent
was
issued
as
soon
as
the
application
was
approved.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
25
years
as
the
conventional
period
that
has
been
extended.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
the
line
of
cases
dealing
with
that
indicate
that,
that
is
not
a
property
right
at
such
but
that
is
a
personal
attribute
of
worth
ship,
tiger
versus
western
investment,
the
lead
case
on
that
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
well
choate
versus
trapp
is
the
case
that
we
have
relied
on
extensively,
and
in
that
case
the
trust
allotments
were
issued
with
a,
i
believer,
25
year
of
tax
exemption.
however,
prior
to
the
expeditation
of
the
tax
exemption
congress
passed
the
statute
reputing
the
federal
tax
exemption.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
the
tax
exemption
is
a
property
right
and
congress
cannot
divest
that
property
right
in
a
trust
allotment
by
subsequent
legislation,
and
in
that
discussion
they
specifically
reconcile
tiger
versus
western
investment.
it
said
tiger
is
a
different
phase;
it
does
not
deal
with
property
rights.
the
restrain
on
alienation
was
included
those
because
many
of
this
indians
were
just
fresh
and
new
in
that
tribal
existence.
they
had
no
concept
of
white
man
ways
of
doing
business
and
serving
minerals
states
and
the
surface
states
in
all
of
that
sort
of
thing.
and
so
they
put
this
restrain
on
alienation
there
in
order
to
keep
them
from
being
taken
advantage
of.
also
it
hopes
that
it
is
settle
down
during
that
25
year
period
and
then
become
farmers
and
that
whole
approach
of
this
restrain
on
alienation
in
the
long
one
of
this
cases
which
i
have
cited,
is
that
the
restrain
on
the
alienation
is
simply
not
considered
a
property
right
but,
it
is
enacting
the
worth
ship,
it
is
a
personal
status.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
on
some
of
the
land,
it
does.
they
can
apply
for
the
fee
patent,
and
get
the
fee
patent
issue,
but
much
of
the
land
is
still
trust.
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
no,
that
is
one
place,
we
disagree.
as
i
mention
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
steven
l.
bunch
well,
i
go
to
part
of
the
section
which
courts
and
member
of
authorities
would
disagree
with
that
including,
felix
cohen
and
this
court
in
a
number
of
its
decisions,
and
matter
of
a
fact,
there
was
a
statement
in
choate
which
specifically
disagrees
with
that.
alright!
on
top
of
page
23,
the
atoka
agreement
was
a
contract
and
the
court
specifically
says
the
question
here
is
whether
the
parties
of
the
contract
whether
they
have
right
under
the
statute.
there
has
been
numerous
cases
of
this
court
that
have
also
held
that
it
was
statutory
rights
and
property
rights,
it
is
not
the
contract
like
case.
but
anyway,
the
section
1
language,
it
says
that
subject
to
the
management
control
of
congress,
we
submit
a
simply
statement.
this
was
the
initial
recognition
by
congress
of
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation.
thus
we
submit
that
they
should
be
interpreted
that
congress
is
saying,
we
recognize
the
northern
cheyenne
reservation
as
a
legitimate
reservation
and
we
are
going
to
assume
our
normal
guardianship
duties
on
this
reservation?.
and
the
statement
of
normal
guardianship
duties
is
what
this
management
and
control
language
mean
on
the
section
1.
also
i
would
remind
you
that
this
is
an
allotment
act
and
the
very
purpose
of
an
allotment
act
is
to
vest
individual
rights
and
real
property
in
individual
indians.
and
if
you
take
the
opening
proviso
this
management
and
control
language
is
opening
proviso
of
in
allotment
act
which
does
not
specific
to
minerals,
it
could
be
it
is
a
power
to
aggregate
otherwise
vested
rights
could
be
use
to
divest
any
right
on
that
reservation.
so
you
would
have
congress
in
a
curious
position
of
beginning
in
allotment
act
with
proviso
which
could
destroy
the
very
purpose
of
the
act.
and
i
submit
that
you
should
not
impute
such
a
skids
away
legislative
design
on
congress
without
more
convincing
evidence
which
is
the
statute
does
not
present.
there
is
also
a
management
in
control
language
listed
in
section
3
which
is
right
at
the
very
end
of
section
3,
and,
however
i
would,
report,
submit
to
the
court
and
this
does
not
reach
the
allotment
minerals
insured
issued.
the
only
minerals
insured
issues
are
the
minerals
underlying
the
allotment
land,
not
underlying
the
tribal
land.
the
court
in
section
3
says
that
the
management
and
the
control
is
limited
to
allotted
lands
or
tribal
land
and
since
to
remained
your
interest
in
the
tribal
state
was
allotted,
it
is
not
subject
to
that
section
3
management
control
language.
this
was
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinions
and
conclusion
on
this
matter
and
i
submit
it
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
