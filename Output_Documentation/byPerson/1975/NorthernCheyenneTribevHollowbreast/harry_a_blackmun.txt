first
mr.
chestnut,
a
good
deal
depends
on
how
you
word
the
question
when
you
say
that
all
that
was
done
in
1926
was
to
announce
a
plan,
you
pretty
much
answered
the
question
in
your
favor,
do
not
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
you
ask
the
question,
if
you
put
it
in
terms
of
what
the
statute
actually
said
then
the
question
becomes
at
least
a
question,
at
least
a
difficult
question,
does
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
statute
did
not
say,
we
hereby
announce
a
plan.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
used
the
word
‘become’.
