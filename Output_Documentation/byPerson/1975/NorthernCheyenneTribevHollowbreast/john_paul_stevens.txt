do
you
think
that
intent
is
of
greater
weight
than
the
intent
in
1961.
i
think
they
made
quite
a
point
at
the
fact
that
the
1961
statute
is
equally
inconsistent
with
your
interpretation
of
the
1926
act.
should
we
consider
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
it
is
relevant
evidence
of
congressional
intent
in
1926?
and
if
not,
why
is
the
intent
in
1968
any
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
for
one
thing
it
specifically
operates
as
i
recall
it,
the
allottees
to
grant
--
that
is
the
tribe
to
grand
leases
of
duration
greater
than
50
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
is
that
consistent
with
the
ownership
in
the
allottees
after
that
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
it
this
way.
do
you
construe
the
61
act
as
consistent
with
your
interpretation
of
the
26
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thrust
of
my
question
is
not
to
get
into
a
debate
about
61
act,
but
i
am
just
wondering
the
extent
to
which
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
either
the
61
act
or
the
68
act
when
we
were
trying
to
identify
the
congressional
intent
in
1926.
