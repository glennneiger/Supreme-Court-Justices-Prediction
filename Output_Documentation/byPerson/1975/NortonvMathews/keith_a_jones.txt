mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
takes
the
position
in
this
case
that
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
appeal.
our
contentions
in
this
regard
may
be
summarized
by
the
following
five
points.
first,
the
appellant’s
individual
claim
for
relief
did
not
require
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
district
court.
second,
the
district
court
lacked
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
class
designated
by
the
appellant.
third,
although
the
district
court
may
have
possessed
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
a
far
more
narrowly
defined
class
of
claimants,
a
suit
on
behalf
of
that
class
would
not
be
cognizable
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
fourth,
even
if
such
a
class
action
were
cognizable
under
the
rules,
the
class
would
nevertheless
been
unable
to
assert
a
substantial
claim
for
an
injunctive
relief,
and
therefore,
under
no
circumstances
would
a
three-judge
court
have
been
required
to
hear
that
case.
and
fifth
and
finally,
since
the
three-judge
court
was
not
required,
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal.
i
will
now
elaborate
on
these
points.
i
begin
the
analysis
by
distinguishing
between
the
appellant's
individual
claim
and
the
claim
for
class
relief.
i
will
first
take
up
the
jurisdictional
aspects
of
appellant’s
individual
claim
for
relief
and
then
discuss
the
implications
of
his
request
for
certification
of
the
action
as
a
class
action.
the
appellant’s
suit
on
his
own
behalf
was
brought
to
review
a
decision
of
the
secretary
denying
him
child’s
insurance
benefits.
as
such,
that
suit
was
governed
by
the
second
sentence
of
section
205
(h)
of
the
social
security
act.
that
sentence
provides
in
essence,
“no
decision
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
court
except
as
provided
by
section
205
(g)
of
the
act.
in
turn,
section
205
(g)
requires
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
by
restricting
the
district
court’s
jurisdiction
to
the
review
of
final
decisions
made
by
the
secretary
after
a
hearing
and
within
60
days
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
now,
it
is
conceded
here
that
the
appellant
did
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
and
the
district
court
concededly
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
his
claim.
our
contention
however,
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
an
appellant’s
request
for
individual
injunctive
relief.
section
205
(g)
as
it
has
been
made
clear,
confers
on
the
district
court’s
power
only
to
and
i
quote
from
the
statute
“enter
a
judgment
affirming,
reversing
or
modifying
the
decision
of
the
secretary.”
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
if
his
argument
is
that
a
reversal
of
a
denial
of
benefits
on
the
grounds
that
the
statutory
classification
is
unconstitutional
is
in
fact
an
injunction
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
may
have
the
same
consequences
as
an
injunction
as
to
the
individual
plaintiff,
but
it
certainly
is
not
an
injunction
in
the
sense
that
section
2282
of
the
judicial
code
refers
to
injunctions.
it
does
not
disrupt
the
operation
of
the
act
in
its
entirety
as
to
all
persons
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
a
question
that
i
was
going
to
reserve
until
i
reached
the
discussion
of
the
class
action
aspects.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
district
judges
in
that
court
might
disagree,
but
it
is
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
if
a
district
court
or
a
court
of
appeals
exercising
purely
legal
and
non-equitable
powers,
holds
a
statute
unconstitutional,
that
is
the
law
for
that
district
or
that
court
appeals,
that
circuit.
nevertheless,
that
has
never
been
considered
to
be
the
kind
of
injunctive
relief
that
requires
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
did
not
think
that
that
was
right.
i
thought
that
if
what
was
being
sought
was
merely
the
provision
of
benefits
to
an
individual
claimant,
that
is
the
equivalent
of
a
reversal
of
the
denial
of
benefits
to
him
than
(voice
overlap)
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
not.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
he
has
not
stated
that
yet.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
then,
that
kind
of
injunctive
--
i
guess
the
frank
answer
is
that
i
am
not
sure
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
the
argument
is
that
even
though,
as
in
lucas,
for
example,
it
may
be
a
reversal,
nevertheless,
it
is
a
reversal
that
is
equivalent
to
an
injunction.
i
mean,
that
--
one
of
these
cases
(voice
overlap)
mr.
keith
a.
jones
as
to
this
individual.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
injunction
that
prevents
the
secretary
from
--
and
a
decision
by
the
district
court
reversing
the
denial
of
benefits
as
in
lucas
is
not
the
kind
of
decision
that
disrupts
the
operation
of
the
act
as
to
other
parties.
our
point
here
is
that,
as
to
the
individual
and
i
am
only
now
discussing
the
individual
aspect
to
the
case,
there
was
no
power
to
grant
injunctive
relief.
all
that
the
court
could
do
was
reverse
the
decision
of
the
secretary
and
that
reversal
is
not
the
kind
of
injunctive
disruption
with
the
operation
of
the
act
that
warrants
the
convening
or
requires
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
it
would
be
more
accurately
and
that
will.
when
there
is
only
one
plaintiff
involved,
really
it
seems
to
me,
we
are
in
a
large
part
playing
with
words
because
whether
it
is
more
closely
analogizable
to
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction
or
a
simple
reversal
of
the
denial
of
benefits,
the
effect
is
the
same.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
is
to
construe
any
request
to
reverse
a
decision
of
an
administrative
agency
on
the
ground
that
it
is
the
application
of
an
unconstitutional
statutory
provision,
the
court
construes
every
such
request
as
a
request
for
a
three-judge
court
injunction.
a
jurisdiction
of
three-judge
courts
is
going
to
be
enormously
expanded.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
although
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
a
district
in
effect
has
a
review
of
authority
over
administrative
agency.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
reverses
the
decision
of
the
secretary,
denying
the
benefits.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
a
kind
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
although
within
the
framework
of
article
iii,
since
the
administrative
agency
is
not
a
court,
it
is,
of
course,
original
jurisdiction
for
those
purposes.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
am
not
sure
what
the
review
provisions
with
regard
to
other
administrative
agencies
is.
i
would
suspect
that
this
is
not
an
extraordinary
form
of
granting
traditional
view,
that
it
is
relatively
common
to
provide
for
a
review
by
reversal,
but
i
am
not
positive
to
that.
but
it
summarizes
that
our
position
as
to
the
individual
claimant.
first,
we
believed
that
there
is
no
injunctive
authority
as
such
because
the
statute
does
not
embrace
it.
secondly,
that
if
the
statute
does,
in
fact,
embrace
such
injunctive
authority
and
nevertheless
injunctive
relief
would
always
be
inappropriate
as
to
an
individual
claimant
because
an
individual
claimant
always
has
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
in
the
form
of
a
reversal
of
denial
of
benefits.
an
individual
claimant
never
needs
an
injunction.
the
opposing
counsel
suggested
that
he
might
need
preliminary
injunctive
relief.
i
would
make
two
comments
with
regard
to
that.
first,
such
preliminary
relief
would
be
no
more
appropriate
here
than
it
was
in
samson
against
kennedy,
excuse
me,
samson
against
murray,
where
it
was
held
that
the
back
pay
act
prevents
injunctive
relief
on
behalf
of
the
individual
federal
employees
who
are
seeking
to
avoid
dismissal.
and
secondly,
as
opposing
counsel
has
conceded,
preliminary
relief
of
that
kind
is
not
the
kind
of
relief
that
would
entitle
the
claimant
to
a
three-judge
district
court.
therefore,
it
is
our
review
that
if
the
appellant
is
to
prevail
in
this
case,
he
must
establish
that
the
class
action
was
appropriate,
that
a
three-judge
court
was
required,
if
at
all,
and
we
think
not,
only
if
a
class
action
was
appropriate.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
certainly
not.
he
could
not
be
held
in
contempt
by
the
district
court
if
he
refused
to
obey
its
order.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear.
i
would
think
that
anyone
seeking
to
hold
the
secretary
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
obey
the
decision
would
have
a
very
difficult
role.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
you
probably
could
get
a
mandamus
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
probably
get
a
mandamus
order
and
enforcing
the
order
if
the
secretary
refuses
to
obey
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
congress
of
course
assumed
that
the
secretary
would
abide
by
final
decisions
of
the
courts
and
determined
that
it
would
be
unseemly
and
inappropriate
and
unnecessary
to
subject
the
secretary
to
coercive
orders.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
fair
method
of
interpreting
the
statute
to
attribute
that
fate
to
the
secretary.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
excuse
me
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
is
like
remanded
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
then
pays
the
benefits.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
the
government
does
not
appeal.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
payments
were
simply
made.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
let
me
turn
now
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
class
relief.
we
begin
with
the
fundamental
proposition
that
the
district
may
entertain
a
class
action
only
if
it
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
of
the
individual
members
of
the
class.
now,
appellant
contends
here
that
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
of
the
class
existed
here
under
the
mandamus
statute
or
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
we
answer,
that
contention,
i
believe
in
full
in
pages
13
through
18
of
our
brief
in
this
case,
not
only
summarize
our
points
with
regards
to
that
aspect
of
the
case.
we
point
out
there
that
first,
this
court
in
salfi
rejected
that
contention.
the
court
held
that
section
205
(h)
of
the
statute,
third
sentence
of
that
provision,
forecloses
all
non-social
security
act
sources
of
jurisdiction.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
salfi
decision
is
plainly
correct
because
it
effectuates
the
clear
congressional
intention
of
restricting
social
security
suits
to
cases
in
which
the
claimant
has
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies
as
provided
by
section
205
(g).
and
third,
we
point
out
that
if
the
appellant’s
position
with
respect
to
the
mandamus
statute
were
accepted,
that
would
lead
to
results
so
anomalous
as
to
be
untenable
because
it
would
provide
for
jurisdiction
only
as
to
those
persons
as
whose
claims
were
the
least
right
for
adjudication.
accordingly,
for
all
these
reasons,
the
only
source,
the
only
possible
source
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
the
class
was
section
205
(g),
but
the
jurisdiction
conferred
by
section
205
(g)
clearly
did
not
extend
to
the
claims
of
the
class
designated
by
the
appellant.
section
205
(g)
confers
jurisdiction,
only
over
suits
brought
to
review
a
final
decision
of
the
secretary,
after
a
hearing,
made
within
60
days
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
the
appellant
in
his
complaint
and
the
district
court
in
its
opinion,
defined
the
class
far
more
broadly
to
include
and
i
quote
here
from
the
district
court
opinion,
“all
of
those
persons
otherwise
eligible
for
child’s
insurance
benefits
who
cannot
qualify
for
such
benefits
solely
because
they
cannot
meet
the
requirement
that
they
would
be
living
with
or
supported
by
their
father
on
the
date
of
his
death.”
that
class
embraces
many
individuals
who
had
no
right
to
sue
in
their
own
behalf
under
section
205
(g)
and
the
district
court
plainly
had
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
of
that
class.
thus,
our
position
is
that
here
as
in
salfi,
the
designation
of
a
class
and
a
complaint
was
plainly
deficient.
the
complaint
contained
no
allegations
that
the
class
members
and
i
here
quote
from
the
salfi
opinion,
“have
even
filed
an
application
with
the
secretary,
much
less
that
he
has
rendered
any
decision,
final
or
otherwise.”
for
the
government,
this
is
probably
the
most
important
single
point
in
this
case.
the
government’s
primary
interest
is
in
obtaining
a
re-affirmance
of
the
salfi
holding
that
the
district
courts
in
social
security
cases
may
not
award
class
relief
to
individuals
who
do
not
themselves
have
a
right
to
bring
suit
under
section
205
(g).
problems
faced
by
the
social
security
administration
in
administering
very
broad
and
loosely
defined
classes,
a
relief
as
to
such
classes,
i
mean,
in
some
cases,
be
literally
insurmountable.
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
awarding
benefits
to
such
class
and
it
should
be
awarded.
in
propriety
of
the
class
designation
and
salfi
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
we
think
that
it
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter
here
as
well.
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
class
that
the
appellant
sought
to
represent,
and
therefore,
was
without
power
to
consider
any
request
on
behalf
of
that
class
by
the
injunctive
relief
or
otherwise.
it
follows
that
the
three-judge
court
was
not
required
to
be
convened
and
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
now,
with
that
said,
as
i
understand
the
appellant’s
argument
here,
he
seems
to
contend
that
the
district
court,
in
fact,
had
jurisdiction
over
a
more
narrowly
defined
class
of
claimants
and
that
the
proper
remedy,
although
he
does
not
expressly
so
state,
maybe
to
vacate
the
decision
below
and
remand
it
for
recertification
of
the
class.
i
would
to
take
some
time
to
explore
the
ramifications
of
that
suggestion.
it
is
true
that
it
is
a
purely
technical
matter.
section
205
(g)
does
appear
to
leave
some
room
for
possible
jointer
of
a
very
narrow
class
of
plaintiffs.
it
permits
the
district
courts
to
review
the
decisions
of
the
secretary,
final
decisions
to
the
secretary,
rendered
after
hearing
within
60
days
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
thus
appellant’s
redefined
class
would
presumably
be
those
applicants
for
child’s
insurance
benefits
whose
applications
were
denied
on
the
same
basis,
the
same
grounds
as
the
appellant’s
request
within
60
days
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
appellant's
complaint.
i
would
make
two
points
with
regard
to
such
a
class.
first,
it
is
very
unlikely
that
the
certification
of
such
a
class
would
be
permissible
under
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
this
is
so
for
two
reasons.
first,
rule
23
(a)
(1)
requires
the
class
to
be
so
numerous
as
to
make
jointer
of
individual
plaintiffs
impracticable.
this
requirement
is
not
likely
to
be
met
by
appellant’s
class.
indeed,
the
appellant
may
be
the
only
member
of
this
class
and
if
there
are
any
other
members,
they
are
very
likely
to
be
few
in
number.
second,
rule
23
(a)
(3)
requires
that
the
individual
plaintiff’s
claim
be
typical
of
those
with
the
class.
that
is
not
the
case
here
and
it
is
not
likely
ever
to
be
the
case
or
very
likely
to
be
the
case
in
the
social
security
context.
most
suits
are
for
review,
and
this
is
true
of
appellant’s
suit
here,
may
or
will
turn
upon
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
secretary’s
factual
findings
were
based.
the
appellant,
for
example,
contested
the
secretary’s
finding
that
his
father
had
not
been
living
with
or
supporting
him
at
the
time
of
death.
similar
factual
claims
might
be
made
by
every
disappointed
claimant
that
the
appellant
seeks
to
represent.
he
has
abandoned
it
here,
but
that
does
not
bear
upon
the
question
of
whether
his
class
was
properly
certifiable
under
rule
23
(a)
(3)
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
have
thought
that
since
the
district
court
could
not
issue,
in
our
view,
an
injunction
against
the
statute
on
behalf
of
the
individual
that
only
if
the
certification
of
the
class
was
proper,
would
there
be
any
substantial
claim
for
injunctive
relief
that
would
have
warranted
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
suggestion
of
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
contraries
that
if
you
did
that,
if
you
follow
that
procedure,
you
would
find
that
there
would
be
no
class
that
could
be
certified.
therefore
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
cannot
be
positive,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
have
no
serious
principle
objection
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
if
the
procedure
was
to
require
the
single-judge
district
court
to
make
all
of
these
determinations
ab
initio
before
convening
to
the
three-judge
court,
that
that
would
be
a
perfectly
appropriate
method
of
dealing
with
these
cases.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
my
next
point
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
that
is
quite
alright,
but
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
that
if
you
surmount
all
of
these
hurdles
as
to
the
certification
of
the
class,
nevertheless
injunctive
relief
is
not
appropriate
as
to
that
class.
what
you
would
have
is
a
class
of
handful
of
applicants
for
social
security
benefits.
all
of
them
had
two
claims.
one,
that
the
secretary
erred
in
finding
that
their
father
had
not
contributed
to
their
support
or
lived
with
them
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
secondly,
that
if
the
secretary’s
findings
were
correct,
the
statute
was
nevertheless
unconstitutional
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
you
had
(voice
overlap)
mr.
keith
a.
jones
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
therefore,
the
decision
of
the
secretary
in
all
of
those
cases
should
be
reversed.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
mr.
justice
white,
that
of
course
is
the
result
in
any
case
in
which
the
decision
is
reversed.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but,
it
is
not
an
order
that
is
not
be
enforced
in
the
same
sense
an
injunctive
order
is,
that
is
it
is
not
subject
to
enforcement
in
the
same
method
as
an
injunctive
order.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
there
are
two
possibilities.
i
guess,
one
would
be
that
a
person
who
had
not
substantial
claim
to
have
satisfied
those
statutory
prerequisites
would
nevertheless
bring
a
suit
for
review
or
secondly,
a
person
might
abandon
whatever
substantial
claim
he
might
have.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
bur,
the
consequence
of
amalgamating
all
of
these
individuals
and
there
may
not
be
many
of
them,
in
a
single
class,
would
be
in
effect,
if
that
approach
is
followed,
to
require
those
individuals
to
waive
whatever
factual
claims
they
might
have.
at
any
rate,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
how
old
those
factual
claims
are
going
to
be
litigated
in
this
multi-plaintiff
suit
for
review
of
the
secretary’s
decisions.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
do
not
think
that
he
is
so
limited
and
if
so,
that
would
be
a
further
constriction
of
the
class
and
i
am
not
sure
that
he
would
find
--
if
you
had
any
members
in
the
class
to
begin
with,
you
would
have
even
fewer
now,
i
suspect.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
what
i
was
suggesting,
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
there
are
general
principles
that
might
lead
the
district
court
to
reach
that
determination,
but
furthermore
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
points
out,
even
if
you
surmount
all
those
hurdles
and
certify
a
class
composed
of
this
small
handful
of
plaintiffs,
nevertheless,
injunctive
relief
as
such
is
not
necessary
because
a
reversal
of
the
denial
of
benefits
is
appropriate
as
to
each
and
everyone
of
the
individual
claimants.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
the
court
would
have
erred
in
assuming
jurisdiction
in
jimenez.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
it
would
the
law
of
that
case
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
secretary
is
going
to
accept
it
as
the
rule
of
law
that
is
applicable
in
cases
affecting
other
applicants
for
those
benefits.
in
short,
to
summarize
very
briefly,
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
and
we
ask
that
the
appeal
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
authored.
he
wrote
it.
he
was
the
author
of
it.
he
did
not
order
it,
i
don’t
think.[laughter]
the
class
that
we
are
requesting
in
this
case
is
the
same
class
that
was
found
in
--
well,
i
will
call
it
jimenez
ii
to
be
a
fair
and
probably
defined
class,
consists
of
people
who
would
only
be
contesting
this
one
constitutional
basis.
it
consists
of
people
who
have
filed
applications
for
benefits.
it
consists
of
people
who
have
met
the
exhaustion
requirements
of
205
(g).
as
mr.
justice
stevens’
suggestion,
what
we
would
call
jimenez
ii,
the
class
could
be
tolled
by
the
filing
of
the
initial
complaint
so
that
there
would
be
a
broad
number
of
people
in
the
class.
i
personally
have
five
clients
who
i
think
would
be
in
the
class
right
now.
it
is
a
significant
thing.
if
there
is
a
factual
issue
as
to
numerousity,
the
best
place
for
that
to
be
decided
is
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
incidentally,
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
this
court's
salfi
opinion
when
it
first
encountered
this
case.
it
think
that
it
is
only
fair
that
the
district
court,
if
we
went
on
the
merits,
they
got
another
chance
to
comply
with
salfi
and
was
not
able
to
do
so
and
salfi
was
a
surprise
in
many
ways.
i
think
that
this
court’s
decision
as
to
retroactivity
and
so
forth
are
such
that
the
district
court
deserves
a
second
chance
to
define
and
use
the
correct
words
in
its
class
definition.
i
have
nothing
further.
