justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
am
i
correct
in
understanding,
i
suppose
it
is
obvious,
the
district
court
here
is
exercising
original
jurisdiction
rather
than
an
appellant
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
the
word
“reverse”
is
somewhat
unusual
for
a
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
order,
when
it
is
changed
is
--
the
district
court
does
not
in
effect
enter
an
order
for
the
secretary.
it
orders
the
secretary
to
do
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
other
than
this
statute,
does
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction
to
reverse
orders?
is
it
not
after
traditional
ways
in
which
a
district
court
exercise
original
jurisdiction
when
it
orders
somebody
to
do
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
why
do
you
assume
the
first
issue
would
be
in
every
one
of
those
cases?
is
it
not
possible
that
the
class
could
be
composed
of
persons
who
would
admit
they
were
not
supported
by
their
father
and
live
with
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
just
one
another
point.
if
your
basic
argument
is
correct,
am
i
right
in
believing
that
this
court
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
jimenez
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
just
be
an
advisory
opinion?
