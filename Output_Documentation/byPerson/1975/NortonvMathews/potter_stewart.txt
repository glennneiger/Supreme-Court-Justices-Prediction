that
does
involve
the
basic
jurisdictional
question
of
this
court
and
presumably
that
could
be
done
by
a
single-judge
federal
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
holding
were
as
my
brother
rehnquist
suggests
that
the
statutory
provision
upon
which
the
secretary
relied
was
unconstitutional,
then
i
suppose
there
would
still
be
a
direct
appeal
of
this
court
under
the
other
statutory
provision,
1252,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
of
course
in
this
case,
the
holding
was
the
opposite
way
on
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
a
lot
of
these
doubts
you
are
suggesting
pretty
well
resolved
in
the
salfi
opinion?
i
have
not
got
it
before
me,
but
did
the
salfi
opinion
not
say
just
that,
that
this
is
the
method
by
which
congress
has
chosen
that
the
secretary’s
decision
be
reviewed
and
a
decision
such
as
this
is
a
decision
of
the
secretary
and
not
of
the
congress,
of
the
secretary
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
readings
to
that
test?[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
does
a
three-judge
court
would
be
required
to
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
been
suggested
that
if
an
individual
claimant
appeals
the
secretary’s
decision,
after
having
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies,
ask
for
a
review
of
that
in
a
district
court
upon
the
ground
that
the
statutory
provision
upon
which
the
secretary
relied
in
denying
the
claim
is
an
unconstitutional
provision
that
that
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
requesting
a
district
court
to
enjoin
that
statutory
provision,
and
therefore,
a
three-judge
court
is
required.
that
is
what
i
understood,
the
answer
of
your
brother
to
be
to
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
functional
equivalent
of
an
injunction,
he
seem
to
phrase
it,
but
that
is
what
i
understood
he
was
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
or
for
everybody
in
that
judicial
district
until
it
is
reserved
or
stayed,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
all
the
effect
that
an
injunction
could
have?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
answer
would
be
yes
to
the
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
what
constitution
was
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
saying
that
that
statute
should
be
very
narrowly
construed?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
interrupted
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
just
curious.
let
us
assume
a
reversal
by
the
district
court.
just
let
us
say,
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
then
is
that
the
end
of
the
matter?
does
the
district
court
just
enter
a
judgment,
granting
the
claimant
what
he
has
asked
or
does
he
go
back
to
the
secretary
for
a
new
proceeding
consistent
with
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
does
the
secretary
then
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
secretary
issue
an
order?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
result
of
the
district
court’s
order?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
it
is
not
important.
