justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
third
case
64-6212
norton
v.
mathews
in
its
way
is
a
companion
case
to
mathews
against
mathews
against
lucas
just
announced.
it
comes
to
us
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
federal
court
for
the
district
of
maryland.
the
issue
on
the
merits
is
the
same
as
in
the
lucas
case,
this
however
is
a
class
action.
injunctive
relief
and
the
three-judge
district
court
were
requested
and
that
court
was
convened.
it
affirmed
the
statutory
ruling
of
the
single
judge
and
ruled
in
favor
of
the
secretary
on
a
constitutional
claim.
a
summary
judgment
was
thus
granted
for
the
secretary.
the
case
however
contains
a
jurisdictional
question
as
to
whether
a
three-judge
court
was
properly
convened
when
injunctive
relief
was
requested.
and
thus
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
a
direct
appeal
under
a
certain
statute,
and
we
need
not
go
into
the
detail
as
to
this,
where
we
hold
that
since
the
decision
today
in
the
lucas
case,
renders
the
merits
of
the
present
one,
a
decided
issue
in
favor
of
the
appellee
and
thus
one
no
longer
substantial
in
the
jurisdictional
sense.
it
is
unnecessary
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
question.
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
therefore
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
