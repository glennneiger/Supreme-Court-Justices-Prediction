mr.
c.
christopher
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
all
parties
to
this
case
and
the
next
case,
matthews
v.
lucas
have
discussed
the
following
matter
and
we
agreed
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
during
the
norton
hour,
we
discuss
jurisdictional
issues
and
during
the
lucas
hour,
we
discussed
the
merits
and
we
will,
if
there
is
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
fine.
thank
you.
in
1969,
gregory
norton
jr.
then
aged
5-years
old,
applied
for
child
insurance
benefits
with
the
social
security
administration.
title
2
of
the
social
security
act,
allows
children
whose
fathers
have
become
disabled,
have
reached
a
certain
age
or
who
have
died
and
whose
fathers
worked
and
were
covered
by
social
security
employment
for
a
requisite
number
of
quarters,
to
receive
death
benefits,
at
least
death
benefits
in
the
norton
case,
upon
the
death.
gregory
norton
applied
for
these
benefits.
he
applied
for
the
benefits
after
his
father
was
killed
in
the
vietnam
war
and
gregory
is
illegitimate.
his
mother
and
his
father
were
not
married.
now,
the
act
is
so
structured,
now
i
will
just
on
this
briefly
because
it
is
not
totally
relevant
to
the
jurisdictional
argument,
but
the
act
is
so
structured
that
most
other
children
who
were
applying
for
child
insurance
benefits
have
to,
in
addition
to
several
not
very
controversial
prerequisites,
have
to
establish
that
they
indeed
are
the
son
or
the
daughter
of
the
wage
earner
i.e.
he
has
to
establish
paternity.
now,
gregory
norton’s
class
have
to
establish
another
fact.
they
also
have
to
establish
in
addition
to
paternity,
that
they
were
either
living
with
or
supported
by
the
deceased
wage
earner
at
the
time
he
died.
gregory
norton
filed
the
cause
of
action
in
the
federal
district
court
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
on
the
fifth
amendment
equal
protection
concepts
of
that
provision.
a
suit
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
maryland.
in
that
suit,
there
were
various
jurisdictional
basis
asserted,
28
u.s.c
1331,
apa
jurisdiction,
mandamus
jurisdiction,
1361
and
also
jurisdiction
under
the
statutory
review
procedures,
42
u.s.c
405
(g).
the
suit
was
also
classed,
stated
to
be
a
class
action.
the
united
states
district
court
in
its
initial
opinion,
held
in
its
opinion
that
a
class
was
to
be
certified,
but
on
the
merits
that
ruled
against
the
norton
claim
by
three
to
nothing
vote,
in
a
three-judge
district
court.
an
appeal
was
then
taken
from
that
adverse
decision
to
this
court.
this
court,
shortly
after
this
court
decided
the
jimenez
case,
jimenez
v.
weinberger,
remanded
this
case
back
to
the
three-judge
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
jimenez
case.
on
remand,
the
three-judge
court,
this
time
by
2
to
1
vote
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutory
provision
that
gregory
norton
was
attacking.
an
appeal
was
then
brought
again
to
this
court
and
that
is
where
we
are
today.
incidentally,
there
is
another
issue
that
has
now
been
waived
by
gregory
norton
and
that
is
an
issue
that
he
indeed
was,
in
fact
in
the
court,
and
therefore,
met
the
prerequisite
of
the
act.
that
decision
was
decided
adversely
to
gregory
norton.
he
waives
the
--
he
has
not
appealed
that
issue.
his
only
issue
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
the
jurisdictional
issues,
is
whether
or
not
the
act
is
constitutional.
because
if
it
is
not,
then
he
does
not
have
to
establish
that
he
was
either
supported
by
or
resided
with
his
deceased
wage
earner
father.
this
case
can
only
come
to
this
court,
if
it
comes
from
a
properly
convened
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
maryland.
we
are
alleging
jurisdiction
in
this
court
now,
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c
1253.
that
statute
requires
in
turn
that
a
review
can
only
be
had
from
decisions
properly
convened
three-judge
district
court
granting
or
denying
injunctive
relief.
accordingly,
we
are
properly
here,
as
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
properly
had
the
power
to
issue
an
injunctive
relief
and
the
kind
of
injunctive
relief
that
would
seek
to
stop
enforcement
of
the
statute.
this
we
contend,
it
did
have
the
power
to
do
and
this
basically
was
the
core
argument
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case.
we
have
two
major
routes
by
which
this
think
this
court
--
to
either
one
of
which
this
court,
could
get
to
the
final
solution
that
there
indeed
is
injunctive
power
in
the
district
court.
one
route
is
by
looking
at
section
205
(g)
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
42
u.s.c
section
405
(g)
and
that
is
the
provision
of
the
act
which
was
highlighted
in
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
weinberger
v.
salfi.
and
by
looking
at
that
statute
itself
and
getting
it
from
the
words
of
that
statute
or
from
how
that
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
general
statutory
interpretation
rules
should
apply
in
this
situation
or
secondly,
if
205
(g)
cannot
do
it
by
itself,
we
contended
the
apa
who
gives
the
power
to
--
for
a
federal
district
court,
if
not
given
the
power
explicitly
by
the
statutory
review
statute
to
issue
injunctive
relief,
sort
of
as
an
ancillary
remedy
to
what
is
provided
by
the
statutory
review
section.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
true.
that
s
true.
i
hope
to
be
able
to
point
that
out
today.
first,
the
general
presumption
which
seems
to
run
throughout
the
cases
of
this
court
that
were
decided
this
century,
is
that
barring
an
explicit
declaration
by
congress
to
the
contrary,
there
is
a
general
presumption
of
reviewability.
now
also,
i
think
that
cases
can
be
read
to
establish,
there
is
a
general
presumption
that
a
district
court
which
is
an
equity
court
has
brought
equitable
powers.
now,
admittedly
each
case
that
has
been
decided
thus
far
deals
with
a
specific
agency
and
it
is
where
they
expected,
the
words
of
each
statutory
review,
provision
for
each
of
the
agency
are
not
the
same
as
being
counted
on
in
this
case.
accordingly,
i
admit
that
there
is
no
case
right
on
point.
but,
there
are
many
cases
which
seemed
not
to
be
limited
in
any
way
and
accordingly
would
be
applicable
to
this
situation.
so
basically,
we
are
beginning
our
argument
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
general
presumption
that
the
court
of
equity,
which
the
united
states
district
court
is
now,
with
the
combination
of
law
and
equity,
can
grant
all
relief
that
is
necessary
to
make
the
parties
whole,
unless
the
congress
specifically
said
that
they
cannot.
205
(g)
of
the
social
security
act,
as
is
pertinent
to
this
case,
merely
says
the
following
that
the
district
court
after
certain
prerequisites
have
been
met
which
gregory
norton
has
met
in
this
case,
the
district
court
should
have
the
power
to
affirm,
modify
or
reverse
the
decision
of
the
secretary
and
we
contend
that
there
is
nothing
in
those
three
words
which
in
any
way
indicates
a
congressional
intent
to
negate
injunctive
relief
in
this
case.
if
anything,
perhaps
the
word
“reversal”
could
be
read
to
include
the
power
to
issue
reverse
by
an
injunctive
relief
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
okay.
i
will
move
on
to
that
point
right
now,
your
honor.
if
we
look
at
how
the
act
works
and
how
impractically
the
needs
of
the
people
litigating
in
this
area,
the
needs
of
claimants
who
are
attempting
to
obtain
social
security
benefits,
we
see
on
two
different
levels
that
there
are
very
many
practical
needs
as
to
why
a
claimant
actually
does
need
injunctive
relief
as
opposed
to
any
other
kind
of
relief.
now,
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
those
needs
and
imagine
what
the
congress
must
have
imagined
and
indeed,
the
congress
has
not
said
very
much
on
this
issue.
we
are
basically
not
working
with
any
explicit
statutory
history.
we
look
at
the
needs
for
injunctive
relief
that
i
would
submit
the
congress
could
no
way
have
intended
to
not
allow
an
equity
court
to
issue
injunctive
relief.
first
of
all
on
the
individual
basis,
now
look
at
this
on
an
individual
basis
and
on
the
class
wide
basis.
on
individual
basis,
when
an
individual
claimant
receives
the
benefit,
there
is
no
necessary
guarantee
that
he
is
going
to
be
paid
that
benefit
in
a
prompt
fashion.
indeed,
there
may
be
cases
when
that
individual
may
want
to
be
able
to
get
benefits
before
a
final
judgment
is
issued
i.e.
he
may
want
to
apply
to
a
court
for
preliminary
injunction
or
something
such
as
that
to
give
benefits
before
the
district
court
has
finally
decided
the
ultimate
merits
of
the
case.
here
is
an
example
where
that
could
be
very
helpful.
in
this
lucas
case
for
instance,
the
oldest
of
lucas’
daughter,
was
past
the
age
of
18,
she
is
now
past
the
age
of
18,
you
cannot
get
these
benefits
if
you
are
past
18,
unless
you
are
still
on
school.
now,
in
her
case,
she
could
not
still
be
in
school
unless
she
had
the
money
not
to
have
to
work.
so
in
many
individual
cases,
there
may
be
have
instances
in
which
the
prerequisites
of
a
preliminary
injunction
have
been
met
by
an
individual
parting
and
for
instance
in
this
situation
where
you
have
someone
who
has
strong
need
for
the
benefits
it
could
very
clearly
be
a
situation
in
which
they
could
establish
the
various
equities
and
so
forth
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction.
that
would
be
one
kind
of
an
injunctive
relief,
but
admittedly,
that
would
be
the
kind
of
injunctive
relief
you
need
in
order
to
have
a
three-judge
court.
that
would
not
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
then
the
government
would
have
to
come
in
and
fight
against
the
preliminary
injunction
motion
and
they
would
balance
the
equities
in
that
situation,
and
either
win
or
they
lose
or
if
the
decision
was
issued
favorably
to
the
individual
claimant,
the
way
normal
cases
work,
that
claimant
gets
the
fruits
of
their
victory
at
that
point,
unless
the
other
side
comes
in
and
requests
a
stay,
pending
appeal.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
indeed,
that
is
the
case.
for
instance,
one
another
case,
it
was
here
on
summary
affirmance
is
griffin
v.
richardson.
in
that
case,
the
three-judge
court
held
another
provision
in
social
security
act
unconstitutional,
violating
the
illegitimate
children’s
rights.
the
government
came
in
and
asked
for
a
stay,
pending
appeal.
they
said
that
$50
million
is
going
to
have
to
be
paid
out.
that
is
too
much.
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
does.
the
three-judge
court
unanimously
denied
their
request
for
a
stay,
pending
appeal
and
mr.
justice
burger,
you
affirmed
that
denial.
the
benefits
were
paid
out
by
the
social
security
administration
or
at
least
the
process
was
begun
before
this
court
summarily
affirmed
that
decision.
now,
that
is
just
one
situation
and
each
case
would
have
to
be
decided
on
its
own
individual
merits.
i
think
that
it
is
even
more.
there
are
more
important
reasons
than
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
indeed,
you
would
have
to
show
a
strong
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
indeed,
you
would
have
to
make
a
strong
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits.
the
irreparable
harm
would
have
to
be
significant.
the
public
interest
would
have
to
be
in
one’s
favor
and
it
would
have
to
not
be
of
significant
harm
to
the
government.
i
am
assuming
that
those
could
be
met.
we
are
talking
now
about
why
injunctions
are
needed
and
we
cannot
specifically
talk
about
this
case
or
that
case.
we
lost
below
in
this
case.
we
are
in
no
position
to
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
this
is
correct.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
right
now,
i
am
saying
--
i
am
about
to
go
to
the
policy
reasons
that
the
congress
would
have
had
to
go
through
themselves.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct.
that
is
my
argument
and
when
the
language
says
nothing,
we
try
to
look
to
other
reasons
as
to
what
the
congress
might
mean
and
now,
looking
at
these
various
actual
needs,
the
claimants
might
have,
i
think
that
this
helps
expose
some
of
the
reasons
why
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
preclude
injunctive
relief.
the
most
important
aspect
of
any
case
such
as
this
is
an
attempt
to
make
everyone
whole
who
has
suffered
under
an
unconstitutional
provision,
in
this
case,
the
social
security
act,
there
is
a
need
for
a
proper
perspective
enforcement
or
un-enforcement
as
the
case
may
be
in
this
situation
of
the
illegal
provision
of
the
act,
there
is
a
need
for
retroactive
benefits
to
be
paid
or
at
least
the
court
would
be
asked
for
that.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
with
respect
to
retroactive
benefits,
i
am
talking
about
the
parties,
the
named
the
plaintiffs
in
litigation
as
well
as
the
class.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
who
have
applied
for
benefits,
who
have
been
denied
by
benefits
solely
because
of
this
specific
provision
that
the
rest
of
the
class
is
litigating
and
who
have
filed
their
requests
for
benefits
or
their
appeal
to
the
district
court
no
later
than
60
days
or
perhaps
we
would
contend
later
on
if
there
is
a
tolling
effect
and
that
gregory
norton
in
fact
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations
for
this
class.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
correct
and
we
do
not
ask
for
anything
broader
than
a
class
that
would
be
defined
as
you
just
define
it.
without
injunction
relief,
there
is
really
nothing
that
can
be
done
in
terms
of
making
everyone
whole.
the
act
itself
is
now
structured
so
that
the
individual
claimant
can
be
made
whole,
but
there
is
nothing
which
makes
everyone
whole.
all
those
illegitimate
children
in
this
case
have
applied
for
benefits,
but
have
been
denied
benefits
because
they
could
not
meet
the
specific
requirements
of
the
act
that
are
being
challenged
in
this
case.
i
think
that
congress
--
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
congress
would
have
wanted
to
preclude
any
district
court
for
making
the
whole
class
whole
after
a
court
had
decided
that
the
provision
under
which
the
whole
class
was
denied
benefits
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
what
would
be
you
are
saying
is
another
word
other
than
injunction,
that
would
be
used
to
define
what
the
district
court
would
do,
and
that
would
be
setting
aside.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
the
court
also
say
that
the
whole
class
of
claimants
should
be
awarded
benefits
in
the
same
manner.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
i
would
have
no
difficult
--
the
word
“set
aside”
i
do
not
believe
in
the
statute
just
as
the
word
injunction
is
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
correct
and
that
is
why
lucas
is
here.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
the
problems
that
i
have
with
getting
relief
and
making
the
class
whole
is
by
something
not
called
injunction,
but
instead
called
setting
aside
of
the
decisions
of
the
secretary
for
a
whole
class
are
as
follows.
there
is
often
a
need
to
assure
some
degree
of
promptness
in
what
the
social
security
administration
does.
the
social
security
does
not
necessarily
act
as
promptly
as
perhaps
they
ought
to
act.
an
injunction
is
something
which
enables
people
to
act
a
bit
more
promptly
and
it
enables
the
attorneys
for
the
people
who
have
gotten
and
received
a
favorable
order
to
assure
that
a
prompt
action
would
be
carried
out.
also,
i
think
that
many
times,
their
classifications
are
needed.
the
secretary
does
not
willfully
disobey
orders,
but
sometimes
there
is
an
ambiguity
as
to
what
an
order
means.
experience
has
at
least
shown
me
that
if
you
have
an
injunction
which
is
ordering
anybody
to
do
something,
that
much
more
readily
assures
prompt
resolution
of
any
ambiguity
that
may
arise.
another
factor
which
would
compel
that
there
would
be
an
injunction
rather
than
to
say
just
to
setting
aside
or
nothing
at
all
is,
that
with
something,
it
is
--
it
would
be
termed
just
setting
aside
the
decision
of
the
class.
you
in
effect
are
assuming
that
the
secretary
is
lost
and
the
claimant
class
as
one,
are
giving
the
secretary
a
stay,
pending,
an
automatic
stay,
pending
appeal.
i
do
not
think
congress
would
have
intended
that
the
secretary
necessarily
gets
an
automatic
stay,
pending
appeal.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
i
am
not
--
it
seems
to
be
the
primary
method
by
which
the
secretary’s
decisions
are
to
be
reviewed.
i
have
argued
my
brief
that
there
can
be
other
methods
also.
for
instance,
we
are
talking
about
the
act,
205
(h)
talks
about
decisions
of
the
secretary.
there
could
be
a
very
good
argument
that
this
is
not
a
decision
of
the
secretary
that
we
are
challenging,
but
it
is
a
decision
of
the
congress
deciding
johnson
v.
robinson.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
let
me
say
this.
it
appears
as
if
--
i
read
salfi
ad
nauseum,
it
does
not
seem
to
have
anything
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
salfi
does
not
indicate
in
any
way
except
with
one
slight
exception
which
i
will
touch
upon,
that
for
instance,
there
is
no
way
in
which
you
can
get
injunctive
relief.
salfi
did
not
need
to
decide
that
issue
because
salfi
had
a
different
circumstance.
salfi
says
nothing
that,
for
instance,
part
of
the
apa,
section
703
to
704
of
the
apa,
give
ancillary
power
to
issue
injunctive
relief.
salfi
does
not
touch
upon
that.
i
do
not
think,
even
if
we
assume
that
205
(g)
is
the
only
way
that
we
get
review
on
this
case,
that
does
not
preclude
injunctive
relief
because
that
does
not
preclude
relying
upon
the
ancillary
apa
remedial
powers.
there
is
nothing
in
salfi
and
there
is
nothing
in
205
(g)
or
205
(h)
which
in
any
way
precludes
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
and,
there
is
a
language
in
205
(h)
which
says,
“in
order
to
get
a
review
under
this
social
security
provision,
you
have
to
follow
all
portions
of
the
act”
and
by
the
class
that
i
have
suggested,
they
defined
that
the
class
by
definition
would
have
followed
all
portions
of
the
act.
we
are
exhausting,
which
is
one
if
the
things
that
salfi
requires.
we
will
file
applications
which
salfi
requires.
i
can
see
nothing
inconsistent
with
what
we
are
asserting
here
and
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
enough.
i
am
talking
about
these
hypotheticals
merely
to
try
to
spell
the
notion
that
congress
could
have
intended
there
to
be
no
injunction
power
at
all.
these
hypotheticals
are
not
necessarily
in
this
case,
but
what
you
said
is
correct.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
i
think
that
it
amounts
to
injunction
if
there
is
the
same
bite
that
order
would
have
which
an
injunction
has
which
means
that
something
has
to
begin
happening
now
or
payments
have
to
start
to
be
made
now
and
payments
would
have
to
be
made
to
the
whole
class.
if
that
is
what
the
setting
aside
entails
and
implies,
i
think
it
is
tantamount
to
an
injunction.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
i
presume,
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested
this,
and
it
would
seem
that
if
you
use
the
word
“set
aside”
and
treated
them
like
an
injunction,
there
are
cases
that
this
court
established
that
you
have
to
then
have
a
three-judge
court.
we
do
not
know.
you
generally
look
at
what
the
remedy
does
as
opposed
to
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
you
are
saying
that
an
individual
ordered
to
set
aside
a
case
would
not
in
effect
stop
the
enforcement
of
an
act.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
i
understand
your
point
and
i
would
agree
with
that
point.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
quite
probable.
my
suggestion
would
be
that
that
would
be
that
that
would
be
tantamount
to
injunction.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
your
honor,
i
think
if
pressed
to
my
hardest
argument,
i
would
say
that
reverse
includes
to
give
injunctive
relief
or
that
kind
of
--
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
pressed
to
that
point.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
reversal
was
tantamount
to
an
injunction
and
operated
like
an
injunction
and
restrained
enforcement
of
the
statute,
a
three-judge
court
would
be
required.
this
a
unique
way
of
approaching
it
and
i
had
approached
it
on
a
traditional
ways
which
would
make
a
little
clearer
as
to
what
was
happening,
and
therefore,
whether
a
three-judge
court
is
necessary
or
not.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
if
that
is
possible.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
the
class
that
we
ask
would
be
defined
practically
in
the
same
term
as
the
class
that
was
requested
and
granted
in
the
jimenez
ii
case,
which
mr.
justice
stevens
authored
for
the
seventh
circuit
quite
recently.
it
would
be
composed
of
people
whose
sole
issue
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
authored.
he
wrote
an
opinion
in
a
case
called
jimenez
v.
weinberger
which
was
the
same
jimenez
case
as
this
court
had
a
couple
of
years
ago,
but
on
remand,
it
is
coming
back
up
again.
