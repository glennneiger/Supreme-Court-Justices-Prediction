justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
order
to
get
in
under
the
apa,
you
have
to
show
that
the
statutory
remedy
otherwise
provided
is
inadequate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
not
though
that
perhaps
the
more
accurate
question
to
ask
is
whether
the
injunctive
authority
that
is
as
you
say
is
generally
available
to
the
district
courts.
is
there
any
way
necessary
to
carry
out
where
the
statute
–
what
this
statute
requires
the
district
court
to
do.
i
mean,
can
it
not
fully
accomplish
what
the
congress
has
intended
that
it
do,
by
simply
setting
aside
the
decision
of
the
secretary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
i
presume
you
are
speaking
with
respect
to
people
who
are
parties
to
the
litigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
class
consisting
of
people
who
had
made
claims
to
the
secretary
and
who
had
made
them
within
60
days?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
even
if
they
had
not
applied
for
benefits
within
60
days,
if
they
would
be
members
of
a
class,
i
suppose
the
class
member
filing
might
be
tantamount
to
a
filing
for
them,
but
at
least
the
class
could
not
embrace
people
whose
claims
had
been
denied
by
the
secretary
more
than
60
days
before
the
class
member
filed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
the
court
not
make
that
whole
class
whole
simply
by
setting
aside
the
order
of
the
secretary
with
respect
to
each
member
of
the
class?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
an
injunction
says
to
the
secretary
as
i
conceive
it,
“this
provision
is
unconstitutional
and
you
are
barred
from
enforcing
it.”
now,
it
might
be
enforceable
only
by
people
who
are
parties
of
this
action,
but
setting
aside,
at
least
i
would
read
405
which
would
say,
“your
order
in
this
case
is
invalid
because
it
relied
on
an
unconstitutional
section
of
the
statute,
therefore,
this
claimant
should
be
awarded
benefits.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
if
the
class
were
uniformed,
properly
a
class,
the
court
could
say
that
the
awards
in
each
of
the
cases
are
set
aside?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
think
that
the
congress
then
show
us
this
particular
language,
affirming,
modifying
or
reversing
the
order
of
the
secretary
as
the
method
by
which
the
secretary’s
decisions
would
be
judicially
reviewed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
in
turn
is
set
aside
is
probably
unfortunate.
i
think
reverse
which
is
the
statutory
line,
would
accommodate
the
same
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
in
a
declaratory
judgment,
expressing
that
a
precise
same
proposition
of
law,
it
does
not
require
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
were
going
to
analogize
the
reversing
because
the
section
was
unconstitutional
to
some
other
form
of
more
traditional
relief
than
that
contemplated
in
405,
could
you
not
just
as
easily
analogize
it
to
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
a
single
district
judge
not
--
supposing,
a
plaintiff
in
the
position
of
an
appellant
here,
files
the
claim,
asks
that
it
is
moved
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
all
those
whose
claims
were
denied
within
the
past
60
days
by
the
secretary
for
the
same
reason
is
his
was.
could
he
not
then,
without
necessarily
asking
for
injunctive
relief,
simply
say
he
wants
all
of
those
actions
of
the
secretary
set
aside?
