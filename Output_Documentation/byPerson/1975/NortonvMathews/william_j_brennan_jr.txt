justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
i
gather
this
is
an
argument
that
there
is
this
equity
power
of
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
affirm,
reverse
or
modify
in
no
way
reduced
that
power
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
curtail,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
not
--
you
are
not
making
an
argument
that
one
may
construe,
affirm,
modify
or
reverse,
although
you
did
say
earlier
something
about
a
reversal
might
in
some
instances,
tantamount
to
injunction,
but
this
is
not
an
argument
and
that
any
of
those
words
should
be
interpreted
as
embracing
that
power?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
do
not
understand.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
power
that
one
usually
has
in
an
equity
court
has
not
in
any
way
has
been
curtailed
by
the
language
used
in
405
(g)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
you
saying
reversed
is
tantamount
to
what?
