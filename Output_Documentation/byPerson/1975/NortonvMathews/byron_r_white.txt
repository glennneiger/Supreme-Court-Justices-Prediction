justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
going
with
salfi
--
you
are
not
suggesting
though
that
the
district
court
would
have,
prior
to
enjoying
the
operation
of
the
act
of
congress,
generally
against
anybody
is
not
enough
for
you
to
say
that
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
judicial
review
provisions
for
the
court
to
in
effect
enjoin
the
operation
--
to
set
aside
the
award
or
to
set
aside
the
denial
of
the
award
on
the
ground
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional?
you
are
enjoining
the
operation
of
the
statute
to
that
extent.
is
that
not
enough,
that
is
all
that
you
need
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
do
you
think
that
the
setting
aside
a
judgment
of
the
secretary
on
the
ground
that
he
acted
under
is
unconstitutional,
does
that
amount
to
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
it
imply?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
secretary
acts
under
a
statute
and
says
that
your
claim
is
erroneous
because
the
statute
bars
it
and
the
court
says,
“that
statute
is
on
the
constitution,
you
cannot
bar
them
for
that
reason.
your
order
is
set
aside.”
now,
the
act
of
congress
--
the
court
is
refusing
to
apply
an
act
of
congress
in
that
particular
case.
i
take
it.
and
he
is
telling
the
secretary
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean,
the
statute
says
in
an
injunction
restraining
the
enforcement
or
the
operation
of
the
statute
as
well
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
at
least
it
might
(inaudible)
with
respect
to
the
entire
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
thought
that
in
a
typical
three-judge
court
situation
that
--
you
need
is
a
three-judge
court
just,
even
though
you
only
challenge
the
application
of
the
statute
in
a
particular
case,
duncan
v.
walker?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
i
would
go
into
court
to
enjoin
and
claim
that
as
applied
to
me,
to
this
set
of
facts,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
it
may
be
quite
constitutional
like
any
other
circumstance
known
to
man,
but
in
this
situation,
it
is
unconstitutional.
now,
does
that
require
a
three-judge
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
and
he
wants
an
injunction
against
its
application
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
true
even
if
you
declare
(inaudible)
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
is
not
really
involved.
is
this
any
different
from
the
duncan
v.
walker
situation
where
this
statute
has
just
not
been
permitted
to
be
applied
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
secretary's
decision
goes
out
--
the
secretary’s
decision
goes
out
the
window
and
may
not
be
enforced
because
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
mr.
jones,
if
the
secretary
says,
“well,
it
is
a
fine
decision,”
i
am
just
not
going
to
enforce
it
and
i
am
just
--
somebody
will
have
to
do
something
to
me
pretty
bad
about
that
decision.
was
he
in
trouble
with
the
district
court
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
he
could
get
--
you
think
the
person
then
could
get
any
more
relief
from
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
go
back
and
get
a
(voice

ordering
him
to
obey?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
another
head
of
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
enforced?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
plaintiff
did
here?
