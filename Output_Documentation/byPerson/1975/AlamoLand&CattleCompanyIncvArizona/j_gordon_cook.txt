mr.
j.
gordon
cook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sure
you
recognize
the
basic
proposition
at
issue
herein
which
is
simply
whether
or
not
allowing
a
lessee
of
arizona
school
trust
land
to
share
in
condemnation
proceeds
except
as
to
the
value
of
improvement
violates
the
trust.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
below,
when
it
reversed
the
district
court,
recognized
this
by
saying
that
provision,
referring
to
the
fifth
amendment,
would
guarantee
to
alamo
the
right
to
compensation
if
they
had
obtained
from
arizona
a
property
right
superior
or
equal
to
the
trust.
so,
it
really
turns
upon
an
interpretation
of
the
trust
and
turns
upon
whether
or
not
the
trust
did
permit
a
property
right
to
be
created
in
the
lessee.
when
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
trust,
i
submit,
you
find
as
justice
rehnquist
said
in
the
lassen
case,
the
act
to
silent.
he
said
there
concerning
whether
or
not
a
special
rule
created
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
as
to
condemnation
should
be
allowed
on
the
face
of
the
trust.
the
act’s
silence
obligates
us
to
examine
its
provisions.
my
opponent
puts
a
lot
of
reliance
upon
lassen,
but
i
say
that
lassen
is
not
contrary
to
my
position.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
what
happened
in
lassen
was
the
arizona
supreme
court,
for
some
reason,
not
following
a
recognized
arizona
statutory
principles
as
to
condemnation
in
school
trust
lands,
in
lassen,
in
footnote
11,
there
is
an
explanation
of
arizona
condemnation
law.
the
arizona
condemnation
law
does
say
that
when
a
right
of
way
is
taken
as
to
the
actual
land
taken,
i
am
not
now
talking
about
any
severed
damages
to
the
remainder,
that
that
right
of
way,
the
agency
must
pay
for
that
land.
now,
the
arizona
supreme
court
as
to
school
trust
lands
did
not
follow
it.
there
is
no
really
good
reason
why
it
did
not
follow
it
because
it
was
against
the
arizona
law,
and
they
said
as
to
the
school
trust
lands,
well,
we
think
that
because
there
is
a
benefit
to
the
remainder
not
taken
that
is
offset
by
whatever
is
taken
for
the
right
of
way.
that
is
not
what
arizona
law
is,
and
so
i
am
saying
that
all
lassen
amounts
to
is
that
it
says
that
the
regular
rules
of
condemnation
law
are
applicable
to
school
trust,
and
that
is
all
i
urge
upon
you,
is
application
of
the
regular
rules
of
condemnation
law.
i
refer
in
part
to
a
quotation
from
lassen
at
87
supreme
court,
page
584,
it
referring
to
the
enabling
act,
intended
instead
that
arizona
would
use
the
general
powers
of
sale
and
lease,
given
to
it
by
the
act
to
accumulate
funds
with
which
it
could
support
the
schools.
i
submit
to
you
that
if
we
consider
those
general
powers,
there
is
no
evidence
below
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
general
powers
simply
because
the
state
of
arizona
in
the
lease
did
not
insert
a
condemnation
clause.
now,
by
condemnation
clause,
i
mean
the
clause
that
says
that
upon
the
taking
of
the
land
by
condemnation,
only
the
landlord
gets
the
proceeds.
now,
this,
by
congress
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
precisely.
that
is
exactly
the
major
point
of
my
argument.
i
would
like
to
first
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
no,
not
at
the
time.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
it
could.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir.
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
a
firm
policy.
i
think
it
should
depend
upon
the
exigencies
of
the
circumstance
and
where
the
land
is
located,
how
leasable
it
is.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
precisely.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir.
i
would
like
to,
first
to
discuss
two
cases
that
your
court,
when
certiorari
was
granted,
handled
together,
and
that
is
the
fuller
case
and
incidentally,
mr.
fuller
is
the
president
of
the
alamo
land
and
cattle
corporation
and
these
are
adjoining
properties
developed
almost
at
the
same
time.
so
here
we
are
again,
except
you
have
a
different
lawyer
on
behalf
of
alamo
than
the
one
representing
mr.
fuller.
the
fuller
case
and
the
almota
case
were
both
taken
by
your
court
at
the
same
time,
and
both
of
those
recognized
general
principles
that
i
submit
did
protect
one
other
than
the
owner
of
the
land.
now,
in
fuller
you
had
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
in
determining
the
value
of
fee
land
taken
by
the
federal
government,
whether
any
increase
in
value
of
that
land
by
virtue
of
its
use
with
taylor
grazing
land
was
something
that
could
be
compensable
and
in
the
almota
case,
there
was
some
dissent
in
that
case
too.
the
question
was
whether
as
to
a
railroad
siding,
the
jury
or
trier
of
fact
upon
condemnation
could
consider
a
non-legally
enforced
expectancy
of
renewal
which
was
going
on
for
some
number
of
scores
of
years
and
the
majority
held
it
could.
i
do
not
wish
to
predicate
my
case
upon
whatever
arguments
you
had
between
you,
as
to
the
majority
in
the
dissent
in
that
particular
case
because
here,
alamo’s
right
was
more
than
a
mere
expectancy.
here
alamo
had
a
right,
which
i
have
shown
by
two
arizona
cases
to
sue
one
who
would
upon
renewal
of
the
lease,
be
awarded
the
releasing
privileges.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
that
is
what
all
the
evidence
below
was
about
and
that
simply
means
that
the
use
is
a
higher
use,
and
therefore,
more
rent
and
upon
reclassification,
there
is
also
a
preferred
right
of
renewal
to
a
lessee.
for
example,
if
it
is
determined
the
land
is
suitable
for
agricultural
purposes
and
there
was
substantial
evidence
below
it
was
not,
then
it
would
be
reclassified
to
agriculture.
if
it
was
then
reclassified
to
commercial
purposes.
what
the
trial
below
all
about
was
how
many
years
would
it
be
until
the
land
would
be
reclassified
for
commercial
purposes.
the
evidence
being
that
but
for
the
dam,
the
nearest
paved
road
was
30
miles
away,
the
land
is,
you
can
see
on
a
map
that
i
referred
to
in
the
statement
of
facts,
some
70
or
80
miles
from
the
nearest
big
city,
it
is
truly
isolated
remote
arizona
land
and
there
was
no
evidence
below,
i
submit
to
show
that
but
for
reclassification,
alamo
would
not
have
continued
in
possession.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir
and
i
did
not
even
argue
below
that
upon
reclassification,
again
there
was
a
preferred
renewal
right
of
alamo
to
continue
to
lease
for
commercial
purposes
which
has
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
the
state
land
commissioner.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
he
testified
and
he
did
not
say
anything
at
all
to
the
contrary
along
this
issue.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
whenever
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
so
what
i
was
trying
to
say,
gentlemen,
when
you
consider
the
two
cases
that
i
referred
to,
the
fuller
case
and
the
almota
case,
they
do
recognize
that
one,
not
the
owner
does
have
fifth
amendment
rights
upon
condemnation.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
the
fuller
case,
even
though
the
taylor
grazing
permits
were
only
for
periods
of
one
year,
it
did
not
say
that
just
because
it
is
only
a
one-year
right,
and
because
that
is
that
the
women
can
preace
to
the
government
that
for
that
reason,
there
could
not
be
any
condemnation
rights
in
the
lessee.
instead,
you
examine
the
taylor
grazing
act
and
instead,
you
said,
that
act
specifically
said
that
nothing
should
create
any
right,
title,
interest
or
estate
in
and
to
the
lands.
no
such
wording
exists
in
the
arizona
enabling
act.
it
does
not
say
there
cannot
be
created
any
right,
title,
interest
or
estate
in
the
lands.
all
the
provision
say
is
if
the
land
is
disposed
of
by
the
state,
which
did
not
happen
here,
state
did
not
dispose
of
the
land,
it
is
done
so
at
the
appraised
value
and
if
there
is
a
contrary
disposition,
there
is
a
breach
of
the
trust
and
it
becomes
null
and
void.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
congressional
record
and
i
have
examined
it
and
you
will
find
nothing
helpful
and
probably
the
best
part
of
a
congressional
record
and
the
only
part
i
can
find
that
has
any
bearing
is
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
decision
in
lassen
which
refers
to
the
senate
record
and
there
what
they
were
talking
about
was
some
abuses,
where
some
of
this
land
was
given
by
the
federal
government
by
enabling
act
to
the
state,
and
the
politicians
found
ways
that
would
make
watergate
seem
like
kindergarten
to
get
those
lands
back
into
their
hands
for
not
really
fair
prices
and
there
was
a
great
converse
--
i
am
sorry,
in
appendix
to
the
senate
report
referred
to
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
decision
of
lassen
that
went
into
some
of
the
abuses
in
the
new
mexico
tall
timber
cases.
and
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind,
when
it
was
saying,
if
the
state
sells
land,
it
should
be
at
this
fair
appraised
value.
they
did
not
say
anything
about
condemnation.
they
did
not
talk
about
condemnation.
now,
let
me
ask
a
question
of
you
gentlemen
if
i
can,
i
have
got
some
time
to
go,
i
notice,
it
is
3
o'clock,
do
we
adjourn
now
or
do
i
continue?
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes,
i
just
--
i
saw
it
through
the
paper.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
thank
you.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
spend
just
a
minute
briefly
revealing
what
i
said
yesterday.
my
position
yesterday
was
that
the
lassen
case
is
not
opposite
to
my
client's
position
and
i
seize
upon
wording
in
the
lassen
case
that
refers
to
general
powers
of
sale
and
lease
given
to
the
state
by
the
act
and
my
proposition
is
that
it
was
for
the
state
to
decide
whether
it
should
or
should
not
insert
a
condemnation
clause.
i
point
out
that
there
was
no
evidence
below
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
acted
unreasonably
in
inserting
or
not
inserting
a
condemnation
clause.
i
distinguish
the
fuller
case,
which
i
mention
is
a
companion
case
almost,
because
there
the
taylor
act
specifically
said
that
nothing
shall
“create
any
right,
title,
interest
or
state
into
the
lands.”
meaning
therefore,
upon
condemnation
by
the
federal
government,
it
would
not
have
to
pay
for
any
right
to
the
fee
lands
because
of
any
increase
in
value,
because
of
the
right
to
use
a
taylor
grazing
lands,
but
there
is
no
such
wording
in
the
enabling
act
that
would
prohibit
arizona
by
not
inserting
a
condemnation
clause
from
creating
a
right
to
the
lessees.
i
realize
that
lassen
says,
“we
must
nevertheless
conclude
that
the
purposes
of
congress
require
that
the
act's
designated
beneficiaries,
derive
the
full
benefit
of
the
grant,”
but
there
is
no
testimony
below
that
they
did
not.
there
is
no
testimony
below
that
one
way
or
the
other,
it
was
not
necessary
to
insert
a
condemnation
clause
in
order
to
lease.
i
remind
you
of
the
fact
that
statistics
show
that
there
is
a
lot
of
remote
land
in
arizona,
that
there
is
a
lot
of
federal
land
in
arizona.
of
the
72
million
acres
of
land
in
arizona
and
i
get
this
from
the
61st
annual
report
of
the
arizona
land
department,
of
the
72
million
plus
acres,
only
11,500,000
are
privately
owned,
51
million
is
federally
owned,
9
million
plus
is
owned
by
the
state
and
in
these
remote
areas,
as
the
testimony
show,
often
there
is
not
a
lot
of
fee
ownership
land.
now,
by
the
fuller
case
you
have
already
said
that
upon
condemnation
the
taylor
grazing
increment
in
value
is
not
compensable.
so
i
say
and
i
ask
you
to
realize
that
if
you
say
that
there
is
no
compensation
allowed
for
the
lessee's
interest,
then
a
very
valuable
tool
on
financing
maybe
lost
and
i
am
backed
up
by
that
by
the
amici
curiae
brief
of
different
banks
and
by
the
fact
that
new
mexico
takes
a
position
by
amici
curiae
brief
in
opposition
to
that
of
arizona.
i
would
turn
then
to
analyzation
of
the
lease
because
the
court
of
appeals
below,
when
it
decided
that
there
was
no
property
right
created
in
alamo,
said
it
was
not
then
necessary
to
discuss
the
lease
provisions,
it
is
now.
there
is
nothing
in
the
lease
that
prevents
my
client’s
position.
my
opponent
seizes
upon
the
word
“vested”
but
that
simply
means
that
the
right
of
the
lessee
is
subject
to
no
contingencies
and
we
discussed
yesterday
of
the
fact
that
here,
in
the
event
there
is
reclassification,
the
lessee
could
be
ousted
from
possession.
now,
i
have
cited
a
myriad
of
cases
in
my
briefs,
particularly
in
the
reply
brief
on
pages
5
and
11
that
i
think
are
without
contradiction
that
say
that
just
because
the
landlord
could
terminate
the
lease,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
tenant
does
not
have
a
compensable
interest
upon
condemnation.
that
is
merely
an
evidentiary
factor
to
be
considered
and
there
is
no
law
that
decides
to
the
contrary.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
i
think
by
necessity,
since
the
lease
came
in
evidence
that
was
already
constructed
by
judge
craig.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
it
was
merely
left
open
in
the
ninth
circuit
because
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
since
it
interpreted
the
enabling
act
and
not
create
a
property
right,
there
was
therefore,
no
fifth
amendment
compensation
to
my
clients
and
they
therefore,
did
not
have
to
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
lease
precluded
the
rights.
but
i
submit
that
judge
craig
did
because
the
lease
came
in
evidence
and
we
argued
that
below.
i
think
you
can
properly
pass
upon
the
lease
at
this
level.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
it
said,
it
did
not
have
to
reach
it,
but
the
trial
court
did.
it
was
at
issue.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
i
must
confess,
i
have
not
researched
that
specific
question
as
to
whether
you
do
or
you
do
not.
i
thought
you
could
pass
upon
it
because
the
district
court
did
and
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
no
sir.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
no
sir.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
well,
that
was
my
second
part.
the
primary
basis
is
that
the
land
had
added
value
in
conjunction
with
the
use
with
alamo’s
fee
land.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
it
said
it
in
the
appraisal.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
the
appraisal
contained
a
statement
and
i
believe
it
is
on
page
21
of
the
appendix
and
i
refer
to
that.
it
said
that
consequently
the
market
value
of
this
river,
dead
land
is
inseparable
from
the
usefulness
in
connection
with
the
dry
grazing
areas
on
both
sides
of
the
river
which
dessert
areas
are
useful
only
when
water
or
livestock
control
and
dependable
forge
can
relied
upon.
and
below,
mr.
davis
at
the
transcript
on
page
86
and
87
said,
and
that
was
alamo’s
appraiser,
as
i
understand
the
statement,
he
gave
consideration
to
the
fact
that
the
state
lease
land
is
a
part
of
an
operating
unit
and
has
value
because
it
serves
as
part
of
that
unit
with
the
dependable
irrigated
forge
and
page
21
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
that
was
the
testimony
below.
mr.
davis
said,
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
worth
$40,000.00
to
$50,000.00.
this
is
remote
land.
it
is
really
in
timbuktu,
without
the
damage,
30
miles
from
the
nearest
paved
road
that
has
no
value
at
all
except
for
the
grazing
purposes
and
what
the
position
below
was,
is
that
when
there
is
dependable
pasture
land
that
is
irrigated
with
a
water
supply
like
alamo
had,
you
are
then
not
depended
upon
the
lack
of
rain
fall
in
arizona
and
depended
upon
having
to
sell
your
cattle
because
there
is
no
feed
upon
the
dessert.
you
can
then
take
your
cattle
into
the
pasture
land
and
keep
them
until
we
get
more
rain
and
you
can
then
utilize
the
taylor
grazing
and
state
lease
grazing.
that
was
the
testimony
below
and
that
is
why
the
appraiser
for
the
government
said
what
he
said.
now,
i
submit
that
his
conclusion
was
wrong.
he
said,
“well,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
get
it
all,”
but
i
submit
to
you
that
is
basic
evidentiary
law
that
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
thank
you.
so
in
considering
the
proposition,
i
would
refer
you
to
wording
in
the
nebraska
case
where
it
said,
there
was
nothing
in
the
nebraska
act
and
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
arizona
act
that
would
assume
to
say
the
state
is
harmless
in
a
situation
condemnation
from
a
diminution
in
the
market
value
of
the
state's
right
to
the
creation
of
a
lease
hold.
now,
all
of
the
cases
that
to
my
knowledge
in
the
west
had
interpreted
these
enabling
acts,
all
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
property
right
upon
condemnation
of
the
lessee
and
this
had
been
going
on
for
years
and
i
have
set
forth
that
authority
in
my
reply
brief
and
i
mentioned
one
quote
from
an
oklahoma
case,
“the
fact
that
land
is
always
for
sale
or
lease,
renders
the
right
to
buy
it
at
the
appraisal
or
to
release
a
valuable
one.”
if
we
turn
to
basic
agency
law
and
trust
law,
i
submit
upon
a
hypothetical
situation.
let
us
just
presume
this
would
be
a
trust
or
a
living
trust
or
trust
by
will
and
at
the
terms
of
the
trust
were
such
as
are
often
found
that
gives
the
lessee,
i
am
sorry
the
trustee
the
full
discretion
to
decide
the
terms
of
a
contract
or
the
terms
of
a
lease.
it
is
basic
agency
law
that
the
authority
to
lease
means
in
usual
or
reasonable
manner.
i
have
set
forth
that
law
in
my
reply
brief
on
page
5.
it
is
basic
trust
law,
when
you
are
dealing
with
how
the
trustee
has
exercised
his
authority.
i
am
not
dealing
with
an
accounting
situation
now
that
when
he
exercises
his
authority,
it
does
presume
to
be
reasonable
until
there
is
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
there
was
no
evidence
below
that
arizona
acted
unreasonably
in
not
inserting
the
condemnation
clause.
there
was
no
evidence
below,
whether
or
not
the
insertion
or
lack
of
insertion
or
such
a
clause
was
necessary
in
order
to
lease.
so
that
this
is
not
anything
to
show
that
arizona
acted
unreasonably
under
those
circumstances
so
i
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
did
not
file
one
on
the
merits,
just
at
the
petition
stage
and
it
raised
the
point
that
has
not
been
raised
here
and
that
is
a
challenge
to
the
method
of
valuation.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
what
they
really
said
in
their
brief
was
that
they
submitted
--
they
agree
that
there
was
a
compensable
right
in
the
lessee,
but
they
wanted
to
utilize
a
short-term
lease
method
evaluation
and
this
came
from
a
long
standing
battle
between
the
united
states
and
new
mexico
and
that
is
why
new
mexico
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes
sir,
but
they
were
talking
about
valuation
of
the
lessee’s
interest
and
they
used
the
short-term
lease
method
evaluation
where
you
try
to
show
that
the
rents
in
fact
are
cheaper
than
the
reasonable
rental
value.
we
used
a
different
method
of
valuation
below
that
their
support
for
the
record
--
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
it
was
not
challenged.
there
was
not
any
challenge
below
to
our
method
of
valuation.
the
challenge
below
was
simply
not
that
our
method
was
wrong
and
giving
the
lessee
what
it
got.
challenge
below
was
simply
that
the
lessee
in
any
event
could
get
nothing,
except
the
value
of
its
improvements
that
was
some
$3000.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
no
sir,
the
united
states
did
not
--
at
the
trial
do
anything,
but
sit
there
and
observe.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
not
--
well,
i
just
mentioned
that
because
justice
white
had
mentioned
the
governments
amicus
curiae
brief.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
i
was
pointing
out
in
this
particular
case,
they
had
no
interest.
if
i
can
just
reserve
a
couple
of
three
minutes,
i
like
to.
mr.
j.
gordon
cook
yes.
i
will
try
to
be
very
brief
and
i
think
i
can
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
posed
here.
the
lassen
decision
below
refers
to
an
arizona
supreme
court
decision
that
compares
the
enabling
act,
section
28
with
arizona’s
constitution.
the
citation
is
181
pacific
second
336
and
it
shows
that
they
are
the
same.
there
are
a
couple
of
minor
distinctions
that
are
not
at
issue
herein.
there
is
an
excellent
annotation
that
appears
at
1
alr
3rd
that
is
entitled
condemnation
property
state
law
and
that
particular
annotation
refers
to
a
decision
of
your
court
in
the
polson
case
which
provides
that
in
determining
a
fifth
amendment
question,
you
can
interpret
the
state
law
and
that
appears
in
the
annotation
on
page
481.
arizona
has
consistently,
by
its
statutes
interpreted
this
right
as
being
a
property
right.
in
fact
arizona
in
the
statute
referred
to
in
both
my
briefs,
the
reply
at
page
10
also
in
a
situation
where
there
was
a
condemnation
for
the
purpose
of
parks,
specifically
said,
the
lessee’s
right
was
“a
property
right.”
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
asked
whether
or
not
there
were
any
decisions
of
enabling
acts
of
other
states,
there
are.
there
is
new
mexico,
in
the
chavez
case
cited
in
my
briefs,
specifically
interpreted
the
renewal
rights
under
school
trust
lands
to
be
compensable.
the
same
thing
as
true
in
oklahoma.
you
can
find
that
in
pages
6
to
10
of
my
reply
brief.
wyoming
is
interpreted
as
a
property
right.
that
has
been
a
consistent
interpretation
in
the
west.
on
pages
5
and
11
of
my
reply
brief,
i
set
forth
a
myriad
of
cases
that
say,
that
although
the
landlord
could
terminate
the
lease,
the
lessee
is
still
has
a
compensable
property
right.
i
would
like
to
mention
the
questions
relative
to
the
appraisal
of
the
government.
on
page
21
of
the
appendix
under
the
section,
highest
and
best
use,
you
can
see
from
reading
that
that
the
appraiser
of
the
united
states
is
referring
to
the
highest
and
best
use
as
grazing.
later
on
he
speculates
about
residential,
but
that
is
what
he
says
as
a
highest
and
best
use
under
that
particular
heading.
and
may
i
say
the
whole
trial
below
was
on
one
issue
and
that
was
when
would
the
property
be
reclassified
for
residential
purposes
and
it
was
determined
that
alamo
would
stand
till
that
happen
and
that
was
by
judge
craig,
determined
to
be
for
26
years,
that
is
what
it
was
all
about
below
and
there
was
no
opposition
to
that
particular
testimony.
and
i
close
by
saying
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions
of
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
nothing
except
left
to
speculation
as
to
whether
or
not,
without
--
with
the
condemnation
clause,
you
would
loose
a
source
of
lessees
and
i
say
the
question
is
real
because
that
is
why
new
mexico
supported
the
petition
and
that
is
also
why
the
banks
supported
the
petition.
and
even
though
you
cannot
have
free
bidding
because
the
state
does
set
the
lease
price,
we
do
not
what
will
happen
as
to
whether
or
not
you
will
loose
the
source
of
lessees
and
i
think
that
is
why
throughout
the
years
in
the
west,
none
of
these
states
have
tried
to
interpret
and
insert
a
condemnation
clause
in
release.
thank
you.
