justice
potter
stewart
as
policy
of
including,
in
each
lease,
such
a
provision?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
say,
the
policy
to
which
my
brother
rehnquist
was
referring
to
was
a
policy,
though
i
understood
you
answer
to
his
question,
that
the
policy
that
you
agree
that
arizona
could
follow
would
be
to
put
a
provision
in
its
leases,
a
so
called
condemnation
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
brother
rehnquistâ€™s
question?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
policy
that
you
and
he
were
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
that
you
both
agree
that
such
a
provision
could
have
been
put
in
and
could,
in
the
future,
be
put
in
to
any
lease?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
except,
if
there
were
a
reclassification,
now
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
thought
that
the
evidence
would
allow
at
least
two
ten-year
renewals
before
any
possibility
of
reclassification?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
function
of
reclassification?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
did
not
fully
understand
of
the
record,
who
does
the
reclassifying
and
when
and
what
triggers
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
probably
not
very
relevant
to
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
but
i
was
just
curious?
justice
potter
stewart
united
states
is
not
so
much
the
overseer,
it
is
the
grantor
of
the
trust,
the
trustor?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
grantor
generally
to
complain,
the
grantor
and/or
the
beneficiaries
to
complain
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
the
trust
provisions
are
not
being
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
it
now
leads
us
to
the
position
of
arizona
in
the
lassen
case
(inaudible).
