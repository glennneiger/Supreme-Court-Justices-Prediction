justice
william
h.
rehnquist
arizona
would
have
been
free
to
adopt
such
a
policy
(voice
overlap)
saying
that
it
wanted
to,
you
are
just
saying
it
did
not
have
to
under
the
terms
of
the
enabling
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cook,
would
it
not
be
likely
if
we
were
to
decide
in
your
favor
on
the
enabling
act
question
and
to
say
that
the
enabling
act
does
not
require
arizona
to
put
a
condemnation
clause,
that
we
would
send
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
or
perhaps
to
judge
craig
in
the
district
court
for
determination
as
to
what
in
fact,
the
construction
of
the
lease
was
under
arizona
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was
left
open
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
ninth
circuit
did
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
not
for
the
appraiser
to
decide
on.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
concern
does
the
government
have
with
the
method
of
valuation
when
it
stipulated
to
the
amount
recoverable
as
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
mr.
gulatto
that
you
win
your
argument
on
the
enabling
act
here
and
the
case
goes
back
and
the
arizona
land
department
continues
to
hold
auctions
for
these
kind
of
leases,
but
inserts
a
condemnation
clause,
because
we
say
that
they
have
to.
your
bidding
in
that
case
is
going
to
be
lower
because
of
the
condemnation
clause
and
without
the
condemnation
clause,
as
if
you
have
taken
away
one
of
the
elements
of
value
in
the
land,
if
you
told
the
lessee
that
he
will
not
get
anything
in
the
event
of
condemnation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
is
a
public,
open
public
bidding
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
is
there
no
competition
then
at
all
in
the
bidding
for
the
land?
i
mean,
can
someone
bid
so
much
break
for
year
and
someone
else
come
in
and
bid
something
more
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
well
then,
would
not
an
appraiser
appraising
the
market
value
of
the
land
for
lease
purposes
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
was
a
condemnation
clause
in
the
lease
and
value
it
at
a
lower
figure
for
that
reason,
because
you
have
taken
away
one
of
the
elements
of
value
that
would
be
in
the
lease?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
do
not
think
an
appraiser
in
deciding
--
appraising
two
identical
parcels,
one
with
a
condemnation
clause
and
one
without
it,
would
make
any
distinction
in
the
value?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
in
effect
that
you
do
not
need
the
enabling
act
to
reach
the
result
you
want
to
reach.
it
is
already
reached
by
the
provisions
of
the
lease
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
rejected
by
judge
craig
and
not
passed
on
by
the
ninth
circuit?
