the
value
of
the
land
was
stipulated
too
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
stipulation
was
based
on
an
appraisal?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
appraisal
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
it
was
based
on
the,
part
of
one
piece
was
based
on
the
value
of
the
land
for
grazing
purposes
and
the
other
included
that
valuation
on
recreational
--
for
the
highest
use
was
one
piece
was
recreation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
--
both
for
grazing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
based
on
a
unit
basis
that
this
land
would
run
so
many
cattle?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
for
the
appraisal?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
you
argue,
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
appraisal
was
based
on,
that
is
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
say?
and
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
appraisal
would
have
been
different
if
the
appraisal
occurred
at
the
expiration
of
the
lease
which
had
no
renewal
on
it?
let
us
assume
the
land
--
this
was
not
leased
and
was
not
located
--
it
was
not
leased
to
somebody
who
owned
the
adjoining
land,
would
the
appraisal
been
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
(inaudible)
conclusion.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
file
an
amicus
brief
on
the
merits
or
just
a
petition
stage?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
position
was
something
you
--
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
that
that
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
enabling
act,
there
should
not
be
a
remand,
they
say
there
should
be,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
united
states
stipulated
to
the
valuation,
did
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
enabling
act,
is
that
issue
still
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
has
never
intervened
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
the
government
has
an
interest
in
--
it
is
just
probably
a
general
interest
is
how
to
value
lesseeâ€™s
interest
that
in
other
cases
they
may
have
to
pay
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
except
to
the
enabling
act,
would
you
agree
that
under
the
petty
case,
there
is
a
compensable
interest
in
the
lessee?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
enabling
act
here
or
let
us
assume
we
rule
against
you
on
the
enabling
act
point,
would
you
agree
that
this
amount
of
money
that
was
paid
in
the
court
of
the
united
states
should
be
divided
between
the
lessee
and
the
lessor?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
there
is
a
compensable
interest
in
the
lessee
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
those
rights
were
determined
in
the
district
court
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
issue
is
still
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
before
you
reach
it.
do
you
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
--
you
think
the
issue
before
us
turns
around,
turns
on
what
you
call
the
enabling
act.
now,
that
was
repeated,
however,
there
was
a
state
statute
too
by
the
arizona
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
claiming
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
arizona
statutes
creating
a
compensable
interest
and
the
lessee
is
forbidden?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
do
not
plead,
but
do
you
think
it
forbids
it?
it
forbids
creating
a
compensable
interest
in
the
lessee
by
a
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
it
is
still
is
a
state
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
think
that
is
sort
of
--
what
my
real
question
is,
is
this
issue
a
matter
of
state
or
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
state
repeated
in
this
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
question
is,
and
the
court
of
appeals
tells
us
that
the
arizona
constitution
forbids
creating
a
compensable
interest
in
the
lessee,
is
it
not
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
but
then
you
also
are
saying
the
arizona
constitution
forbids
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
think
that
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
disagree
with
court
of
appeals
on
construing
a
state
statute
or
state
constitution?
you
would
be
happy
if
we
did
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
this
is
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
suppose
we
have
to
get
at
the
state
constitution
has
to
mean
what
the
enabling
act
means?
