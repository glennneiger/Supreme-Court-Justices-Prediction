justice
lewis
f.
powell,

as
i
understand
what
you
have
said,
it
is
your
view
that
there
is
no
compensable
value
in
the
lease,
whether
the
transaction
is
a
sale
or
condemnation
and
that
that
results
from
the
enabling
act
without
regard
to
arizona
law?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
a
straight
sale
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
us
put
arizona
law
aside
for
the
moment.
do
you
construe
the
act
itself
as
preventing
any
compensable
interest
in
a
valid
lease
whether
it
is
a
sale
rather
than
a
condemnation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
have
already
agreed
that
in
a
private
transaction
the
full
value
of
land
subject
to
a
lease,
would
take
into
account
the
value
of
the
unexpired
term
of
the
lease?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
cite
any
authority
in
your
brief
dealing
with
the
question
of
a
full
--
of
a
sale
and
the
value
that
is
recoverable
under
those
circumstances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
were
allowing
the
state
statutes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
is
no
case
under
the
enabling
act
itself
which
says
that
there
is
no
compensable
value
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
to
a
lease
on
a
straight
sale?
