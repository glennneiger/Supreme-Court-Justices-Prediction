mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
more
that
i
read
the
lassen
case
and
the
enabling
act,
the
more
difficult
i
find
it
to
reconcile
petitioner's
arguments
with
these
provisions
of
the
act
and
provisions
of
the
lassen
case.
without
going
into
a
great
deal
of
detail,
i
think
that
from
a
general
reading
of
the
lassen
case,
it
can
be
easily
detected
that
arizona’s
restrictions
on
the
use
of
their
enabling
act
lands
are
much
stricter
than
they
are
in
practically
in
any
other
state
and
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
lands
were
being
diverted
to
private
use
and
the
moneys
derived
there
from
were
being
be
used
for
other
purpose,
for
private
advantage.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
without
the
restrictions
on
the
enabling
act,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
general
condemnation
law,
both
federal
and
at
the
state
level
that
lessee
has
a
compensable
interest
in
property
being
condemned
without
a
condemnation
clause.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
if
there
is
a
compensable
interest
in
the
lessee
then
it
would
have
to
be
determined
based
on
the
relative
rights
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
they
were
determined
--
i
do
not
agree
with
the
determination
at
the
district
court
level
because
they
misapplied
the
law
and
this
was
the
final
argument
in
my
brief.
i
raised
it
in
the
final
argument
of
my
brief,
i
raised
at
the
trial
court,
and
i
raised
it
at
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
that
issue
is
still
open,
but
i
think
it
is
open
more
as
a
matter
of
law
than
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
the
position
is
that
in
the
event
that
the
lessee
has
a
compensable
interest,
that
it
can
only
be
determined
based
on
the
actual
life
of
the
present
lease
and
you
cannot
speculate
on
a
renewal
and
this
is
consistent
with
all
the
cases
we
have
cited.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
we
put,
i
put
a
multiple
dollar
value
on
it.
there
were
two
or
three
different
ways
you
could
arrive
at
a
value
and
these
were
what
we
argued
to
the
court
below,
trial
court
and
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
these
are
set
forth
in
my
brief.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
if
you
go
on
just
the
actual,
on
the
basis
of
the
life
of
the
lease,
then
it
comes
to
$19000
as
opposed
to
$57000
for
a
26-year
term.
if
you
go
on
a
basis
of
the
highest
sale
of
any
cattle
unit
on
a
state
lease
land,
it
comes
down
to
approximately
$6000
and
i
have
set
that
forth
in
my
brief
and
this
is
the
testimony
that
was
elicited
from
mr.
davis
on
cross
examination.
i
like
to
point
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
right.
the
arizona
legislature
enacted.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
that
is
constitutional.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
i
do
not
think
the
arizona
statutes
create
a
compensable
interest
on
the
lessee.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
think
the
provision
is
in
the
state
constitution
and
it
is
practically
a
re-script
of
the
enabling
act.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
yes.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
the
enabling
act
restrictions
are
imposed
by
congress,
so
therefore
it
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
if
you
come
back
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
that
is
correct,
but
they
also
say
that
the
enabling
act
forbids
it,
that
we
were
not
ever
authorized
to
do
it.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well
i
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
think
that
if
an
interpretation
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
suppose.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
think
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
enabling
act
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
now,
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
state
constitution,
i
think
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
just
so
it
is
consistent
with
the
--
or
not
in
our
position
to
any
federal
statute
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
think
that
the
restrictions
placed
on
the
use
of
the
trust
lands
by
congress
can
be
tightened,
but
they
cannot
be
loosened.
in
other
words,
the
state
can
make
a
more
restrictive
use
of
the
trust,
but
they
cannot
make
a
less
restrictive
of
use
of
the
trust.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
yes.
when
you
look
at
the
conclusion
of
the
lassen
case,
this
court
held
that
arizona
could
go
ahead
without
complying
with
the
action
procedures
on
a
direct
sale
of
land
to
a
condemning
authority
as
long
as
it
used
the
standard
which
nearly
reproduces
the
result
of
the
auction.
now,
under
the
enabling
act
and
under
the
state
constitution,
the
only
way
that
land
is
sold
out
of
the
trust
is
for
it
to
be
put
up
for
public
auction,
first
of
all
to
be
appraised,
to
be
advertised
for
ten
weeks,
to
be
put
up
for
public
auction
and
to
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
at
not
less
than
the
appraised
value
and
on
the
distribution
of
the
proceeds,
the
entire
value
of
the
land
goes
to
the
trust
and
the
lessee
only
gets
the
value
of
the
improvements
and
i
would
like
to
disagree
with
mr.
cook.
an
examination
of
the
enabling
act
shows
that
the
restrictions
that
were
placed
on
the
trust
that
says
that
the
trust
can
only
be
used
for
the
purposes
set
forth
and
that
it
cannot
be
sold
or
leased
for
any
purpose
in
consistent
with
the
trust
unless
the
trust
is
fully
compensated,
except
that
it
authorizes
the
legislature
to
lease
the
land
for
various
purposes,
for
grazing,
agricultural,
domestic
and
commercial
and
in
commercial
this
has
a
rather
broad
definition
of
any
use,
not
otherwise
set
forth,
for
mining
purposes,
for
oil
and
gas
exploration
and
leasing.
and
also
it
states,
in
the
same
provision,
that
the
legislature
is
authorized
to
protect
the
lessee
for
the
value
of
his
improvements
and
on
the
sale
of
the
property,
the
lessee
shall
be
paid
by
either
the
succeeding
lessee
or
the
succeeding
purchaser.
so
the
enabling
act
does
address
itself
to
what
the
lessee
is
entitled
to
on
the
sale
of
property.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
if
you
are
looking
at
this
case
we
are
in
grazing,
the
method
for
determining
grazing
rentals
of
land
is
set
forth
by
statute
in
arizona
revised
statutes
37255
i
believe,
285,
it
is
set
forth
to
my
brief.
it
says
statutory
determination
based
on
the
percentage
of
the
price
of
cattle,
multiplied
by
the
number
of
the
sections
carrying
capacity.
in
other
words,
the
price
that
arizona
gets
for
the
rental
as
a
minimum
price
based
in
the
economic
return
to
the
rancher
for
what
he
gets
from
the
cattle,
he
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
oh,
not
on
the
determination
of
the
rental
value
of
the
land
or
on
the
leasing.
if
land
comes
up
for
a
lease
that
has
not
been
leased
before,
what
the
state
land
commissioner
does
is
he
reviews
the
application
to
see
who
can
make
the
more
successful
use
of
the
land
that
will
result
in
the
best
return
to
the
trust.
every
decision
that
the
land
commissioner
makes
is
ultimately
directed
towards
what
is
the
best
interest
of
the
trust
and
how
are
we
going
to
be
able
to
produce
the
most
revenue,
not
what
lessee
is
going
to
be
able
to
make
the
best
profit
of
the
land
and
with
this
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
no,
what
is
done
first
is
the
value
of
the
land,
the
market
value
of
the
land
for
lease
purposes
is
made
by
appraisal
and
the
land
is
not
leased
for
less
than
that
appraisal.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
do
not
think,
from
what
i
know
of
the
demand
for
state
leases
that
this
really
makes
any
difference,
would
make
any
difference
in
the
rental
value
at
all,
especially
of
grazing
leases.
now,
you
see
on
a
commercial
lease
or
on
an
agricultural
lease,
the
lessee
is
protected
for
the
value
of
his
improvements
and
he
will
be
paid
or
those,
in
any
event
if
the
land
is
sold
or
leased
to
someone
else,
and
for
another
lessee
to
come
in
and
pay
for
those
improvements
really
makes
it
quite
burdensome
once
a
land
is
developed.
so
i
do
not
think
it
is
really
going
to
affect
the
market
value
of
the
land
at
all.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
no.
when
you
look
at
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
lease
whether
or
not
you
have
the
hardcore
condemnation
clause
that
mr.
cook
is
referring
to,
when
you
have
a
provision
that
the
land
can
be
reclassified
to
another
purpose
and
under
that
event,
the
lessee
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
release
the
land
under
those
circumstances.
he
has
a
preference,
but
still
the
best
interest
of
the
trust
is
going
to
be
served
rather
than
the
lessee’s
interest,
when
you
look
to
fact
that
the
lease
provides
that
nothing
in
the
lease
shall
create
a
vested
interest.
now,
i
think
extending
this
out
to
include
the
language
that
was
used
under
the
taylor
trust
is
sort
of
hallow
argument.
i
think
that
what
we
are
looking
at
is
we
are
looking
at
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
say
to
the
lessee,
“look,
you
do
not
have
any
rights
in
this
land.
all
we
are
doing
is
giving
it
to
you
to
lease
in
order
to
accommodate
the
administrative
function
that
is
going
to
be
longer
than
for
a
term
of
a
month
to
month
or
year
to
year.
we
will
give
the
ten
year
lease,
but
subject
to
these
conditions
where;
one,
we
can
relinquish
it
to
united
states;
two,
we
can
end
up
granting
easements
for
multiple
purposes
across
the
land;
three,
that
it
can
be
reclassified
and
four,
you
have
no
vested
interest.”
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
take
all
these
together,
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
saying
in
effect,
look
you
do
not
have
any
rights
and
the
lease
can
be
terminated.
it
can
be
terminated
on
30
days.
suppose
we
come
across
a
parcel
of
land
that
the
state
wants
or
the
united
states
wants
that
it
is
under
grazing
lease
and
they
want
it
to
develop
in
reference
to
a
recreational
purpose
and
we
will
say
the
park
service,
if
there
is
a
demand
for
that
land
for
other
than
grazing,
then
the
highest
and
best
use
is
not
being
served
and
we
go
to
a
reclassification
and
in
that
event,
the
lease
is
terminated.
the
lessee
does
not
have
any
greater
rights
in
the
30
days,
right
to
continue
occupancy.
i
really
do
not
see
that
the
length
of
lease
has
any
bearing
on
his
rights
when
you
look
at
the
specific
terms
of
a
lease.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
that
was
one
of
my
arguments
below
and
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
i
am
making
here.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
that
is
right.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
cook
said
that
the
highest
and
best
use
of
this
land
was
determined
by
the
appraiser
to
be
grazing
on
page
20.
on
page
30
of
the
abstract
at
the
beginning
paragraph
referring
to
parcel
304,
the
appraiser
and
the
only
appraiser
that
we
have
determined
that
the
recreational
oriented
home
site
would
be
the
best
market
and
on
page
32
at
the
bottom
paragraph
with
reference
to
parcel
305,
the
appraiser
determined
that
major
value
of
this
section
is
its
residential
ranch
headquarters,
speculative
recreational
value,
and
reliably
predictable
multiple
usefulness.
now,
none
of
these
highest
and
best
use
values
are
based
on
a
grazing
value.
the
value
of
the
land
is
separate
and
apart
and
in
federal
condemnation
law,
what
the
appraisal
function
is,
is
first
to
determine
what
partial
is,
what
is
its
highest
and
best
use
and
the
value
of
that
particular
parcel.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
that
is
right.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
okay.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
support
that
holding.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
support
that
holding
because
the
enabling
act
provides
that
the
land
was
granted
to
the
state
of
arizona
in
trust
for
the
use
of
the
common
schools
and
it
says
disposition
of
any
of
the
lands
or
any
of
the
money’s
or
thing
of
value
directly
or
indirectly
divided
from
the
lands,
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
deemed
to
be
breech
of
the
trust.”
therefore,
what
we
can
do
with
the
land
was
limited.
the
method
that
we
can
dispose
of
the
land,
namely
through
the
auction
procedures
and
the
sale
and
the
appraisal
is
restricted.
the
use
to
which
we
can
put
the
money
after
the
land
is
sold
is
restricted.
the
only
thing
we
can
do
is
put
it
in
the
trust
fund
and
use
the
revenues
from
that
trust
fund
for
the
support
of
the
common
schools.
it
also
says
that
no
mortgage
or
other
in
encumbrance
of
the
said
lands
or
any
part
thereof
shall
be
valid
in
favor
of
any
person
for
any
purpose
under
any
circumstances
whatsoever.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
as
direct
a
statement,
saying
that
a
mortgage
is
invalid
against
state
lands
is
possibly
can
be
written.
now,
arizona
has
recognized
that
a
lessee
may
need
money
in
order
to
develop
land,
and
therefore,
the
legislature
has
authorized
the
mortgage
of
the
lessee’s
rights
which
ends
up
letting
the
value
of
the
improvements
be
leased
and
upon
the
sale
of
the
--
or
on
a
default
of
the
mortgage,
the
mortgage
company
can
foreclose
on
the
lease
and
the
lessee’s
interest,
but
it
never,
the
statute
involved,
never
permits
the
state
land
to
be
prejudiced
because
if
you
do
let
state
lands
be
sold
to
satisfy
a
mortgage
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
that
is
right.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
that
is
right.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
yes,
and
i
think
that
this
is
--
the
argument
is
supported
by
the
language
in
the
lassen
case
and
also
in
the
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
that
is
right.
now,
when
you
look
at
the
u.s
v.
ervin,
it
says
words
more
clearly
designed
to
create
a
definite
and
specific
trust
could
hardly
have
been
chosen.
this
was
cited
in
the
lassen
case.
i
think
that
this
supports
the
conclusion
and
the
position
of
the
state
with
reference
to
the
compensable
interest.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
yes.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
if
there
is
a
straight
sale,
there
is
no
possibility
under
arizona
law
or
under
the
enabling
act
for
the
lessee
to
participate
in
the
value
of
the
land
award,
or
the
value
of
the
purchase
price.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
when
the
act
speaks
in
terms
of
that,
“no
land
shall
be
sold
except
for
the
full
appraised
value
and
that
the
trust
has
to
be
compensated
for
the
full
appraised
value
of
the
land,”
i
think,
yes,
that
the
enabling
act
prohibits
the
lessee
from
participating
in
the
value
--
in
the
proceeds
of
a
sale.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
yes
and
of
course
taking
into
consideration,
the
specific
terms
of
the
lease
and
whether
or
not
there
was
a
condemnation
clause,
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
private,
that
this
land
can
be
dealt
with
as
private
land
because
of
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
enabling
act
and
by
the
state
constitution.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
the
authority
that
i
cite
is
the
state
statutes.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
and
the
constitution
and
the
enabling
act
and
i
do
not
have
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
well,
you
can
go
to
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
you
can
go
to
the
nebraska
case
which
the
trial
court
relied
on
and
which
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished
and
in
that
case
the
eight
circuit
determined
that
under
the
nebraska
enabling
act,
the
lessee
had
a
right
to
participate
in
the
award.
however,
when
you
look
at
the
terms
of
the
nebraska
enabling
act,
the
enabling
act
just
made
a
direct
grant
to
the
state
and
there
were
no
restrictions
on
the
use
or
disposal
of
lands.
and
therefore,
under
the
nebraska
enabling
act,
that
decision
seems
correct
and
consistent
with
the
general
condemnation
law
on
the
lessee’s
rights.
however,
when
you
look
at
the
restrictions
that
arizona
has
under
its
enabling
act,
i
do
not
think
that
the
two
cases
can
be
reconciled.
so,
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished
the
case
and
i
think
rightly
so.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
in
imposing
the
restrictions,
was
that
there
was
a
dissipation
of
the
trust
without
having
the
revenues
generated
from
the
sale
of
the
land
going
to
the
trust
fund
for
the
use
of
the
beneficiaries.
that
is
what
they
were
trying,
exactly
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
by
imposing
these
restrictions.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
not
at
all
and
i
have
cited
the
nebraska
enabling
act
and
at
that
portion,
i
believe
it
is
section
7
in
my
brief
and
it
just
grants
the
land
to
the
state.
it
is
interesting
thought
that
a
trust
concept
relying
on
the
lassen
case
was
imposed
by
the
nebraska
district
court,
even
after
the
lassen
case
came
down
and
said
well,
these
are
trust
lands
and
the
federal
government
has
to
pay
for
rights
way
over
the
trust
lands
which
they
had
not
been
doing
before.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
oh!
i
totally
disagree
with
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
disagree
with
the
whole
concept
or
the
whole
concept
of
the
us
solicitors,
especially
when
you
considered
that
from
the
onset
of
this
case
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
attorney
is
supposed
to
be
the
ultimate
overseer
of
the
trust
and
we
endeavored
to
get
the
support
of
the
us
attorney
in
the
case
and
the
phoenix
office
at
least
agreed
with
us
and
went
along
with
the
concept
that
the
lessee
had
no
compensable
interest
and
the
first,
i
was
aware
that
the
united
states
was
taking
different
position
was
when
they
filed
this
brief.
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
suppose,
so
we
have
a
great
difference
of
opinion
there,
but
i
think
if
the
united
states
is
the
ultimate
overseer
of
the
trust
and
their
ultimate
responsibility
is
to
be
an
advocate
on
behalf
of
the
trust,
i
do
not
see
that
this
position
is
really
consistent
with
the
best
interest
of
the
trust.
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
analyzing
and
seeing
a
conflict
between
those
two
cases
as
correct.
i
think
what
you
have
to
do
is
you
have
to
look
at
each
trust
responsibility
and
determine
what
the
responsibility
is.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
also
under
the
enabling
act,
the
us
attorney
has
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
the
trust
provisions.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
so
they
can
come
in
anytime
in
arizona
as
violating
the
trust
provisions,
they
can
come
and
take
over.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
suppose.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
so
it
would
create
a
situation
i
suppose
that
if
the
united
states
had
come
in
and
attempted
to
defend
the
trust
in
this
type
of
an
action
where
it
is
a
federal
condemnation,
it
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
stating
a
claim
because
it
would
be
the
united
states
suing
the
united
states
and
in
other
words
they
withdraw
lands
for
a
particular
purpose
under
the
administration
of
the
state,
but
still
under
the
control
of
the
united
states
and
congress
and
they
are
suing
to
condemn
them
for
another
purpose
and
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
worked
out
administratively.
mr.
peter
c.
gulatto
i
think
so.
we
find
ourselves
fighting
each
other
a
lot.
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
this
remark.
if
we
are
going
to
nearly
reproduce
the
result
to
the
auction
as
lassen
prescribes
that
we
must
do
if
we
are
going
to
have
sales
other
than
at
public
auction.
in
order
for
this
court
to
not
establish
a
dual
standard
in
the
distribution
of
state
funds,
i
think
the
only
solution
is
to
determine
that
just
as
in
a
sale
of
public
lands
through
the
auction
procedures
that
the
state
and
the
trust
must
derive
the
full
benefit
of
the
sale
of
the
lands
and
i
think
to
conclude
that
a
lessee
has
a
compensable
interest
in,
only
in
a
condemnation
case
and
not
at
under
any
other
circumstance,
really
does
not
make
a
uniform
consistent
application
in
the
trust
and
does
not
constitute,
what
i
would
say,
results
in
the
trust
being
compensated
for
the
full
appraised
value
of
land
taken
out
of
the
trust.
thank
you.
