(inaudible)
what
the
law
is
in
the
ninth
circuit
with
respect
to
this
or
the
other
circuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
gulatto,
i
take
it
then
you
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general,
when
he
says
in
his
amicus
curiae
briefs,
submitted
in
connection
with
the
petition
for
cert
that
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
two
decisions,
that
is
the
nebraska
case
and
the
one
below
here,
represent
a
conflict
and
approach
to
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
presented
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
the
sg
is
the
superior
of
the
phoenix
office?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
concerns
lands
that
were
held
by
the
state
of
arizona
in
trust
for
common
school
purposes,
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
new
mexico-arizona
enabling
act
of
1910
and
what
prompted
the
lawsuit
was
the
united
states'
condemnation
of
some
of
the
state
trust
lands
in
connection
with
the
flood
control
of
the
dam
and
reservoir.
at
the
time
of
the
condemnation,
the
lands
were
under
lease
from
the
state
to
private
parties,
and
the
issue
is
as
to
allocation
of
the
condemnation
proceeds.
the
district
court
awarded
the
arizona
a
certain
portion
of
the
proceeds
for
its
interest
in
fee,
and
then
awarded
the
lessee
another
portion
for
the
improvements
on
the
land
and
the
remainder
for
its
leasehold
interest.
on
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
approved
the
allocation
for
the
improvements,
but
it
held
that
under
the
enabling
act,
the
state,
as
trustee,
had
no
power
whatsoever
to
grant
a
compensable
leasehold
interest,
and
therefore,
that
the
lessee
at
the
condemnation
took
nothing
beyond
the
value
of
the
improvements.
in
other
words,
all
the
rest
went
to
the
state,
as
trustee.
we
find
ourselves
in
disagreement
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
judgment
accordingly
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
usually,
the
fifth
amendment
protects
the
outstanding
leasehold
interest
and
makes
the
holder
of
that
interest
entitled
to
just
compensation
when
it
is
taken
upon
condemnation.
we
note,
however,
that
it
maybe
that
under
state
law
the
lessee
could
not
posses
a
compensable
leasehold
interest
upon
federal
condemnation.
there
are
other
questions
in
the
case
as
to
value
and
as
to
the
basic
validity
of
the
interest,
and
all
of
these
questions
remain
open
on
remand.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
in
which
mr.
brennan
has
joined,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
