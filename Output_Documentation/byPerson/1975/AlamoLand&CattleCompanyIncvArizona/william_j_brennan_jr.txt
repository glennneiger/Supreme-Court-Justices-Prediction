justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
put
a
dollar
value
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
less
than
the
$57000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
suppose
the
enabling
act
does
not
as
you
say
it
does
include
a
prohibition,
but
the
state
constitution
does,
what
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
here
they
may
in
fact,
if
the
state
constitution
that
made
them
more
restrictive,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
decided
was,
that
under
the
enabling
act,
arizonaâ€™s
trustee
had
no
power
to
grand
a
compensable
interest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
these
arguments
you
now
have
been
making
do
not
address
that
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
--
you
support
that
holding,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
in
the
face
of
those
provisions
of
the
enabling
act,
the
state
could
not
do
any
different
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
whether
if
it
tried
to
give
a
compensatory
property
right
to
lessee,
it
could
not
because
of
the
enabling
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
of
course
you
go
on
and
say
in
any
event,
anything
that
the
state
did
do,
whether
by
constitutional
or
statutory
provision,
it
is
preferably
consistent
with
the
prohibition
against
granting
a
compensable
property?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
nebraska
act
did
not
have
any
counterpart
of
section
28
of
the
arizona?
