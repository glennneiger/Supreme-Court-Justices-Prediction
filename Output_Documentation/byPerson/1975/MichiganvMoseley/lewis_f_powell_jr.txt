justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
your
position
here
today
be
different
if
there
had
been
probable
cause
for
the
arrest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
make
precisely
the
same
argument,
would
you
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
issue
on
which
the
michigan
supreme
court
or
the
appellate
court
decided
this
case
and
the
issue
presented
to
us
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
illegality
of
the
arrest.
that
is
an
issue
that
was
not
addressed
by
that
court.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
i
have
understood
your
argument
this
afternoon,
it
has
been
based
almost
exclusively
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
line
of
argument.
i
had
read
the
decision
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
as
laying
down
a
per
se
rule
relying
on
the
language
accorded
from
miranda.
would
you
elaborate
on
what
i
just
said?
do
you
support
the
per
se
rule
the
michigan
court
laid
down
or
do
you
agree
that
it
lay
down
the
per
se
rule?
