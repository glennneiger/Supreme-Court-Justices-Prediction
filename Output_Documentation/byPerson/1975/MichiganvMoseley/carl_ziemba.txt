mr.
carl
ziemba
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
semantic
problem
rather
than
a
legal
one
or
perhaps
it
comes
to
the
same
thing,
since
real
law
deals
with
nothing
but
words.
i
think
that
the
semantic
problem
initially
starts
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
“quit.”
now,
mark
twain
once
told
us
that,
quitting
smoking
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
do.
i
have
done
it
hundreds
of
times
and
apparently
this
is
what
the
detroit
police
department
and
the
wayne
county
prosecutor
says.
miranda
says,
true
enough,
when
an
accused
under
custodial
interrogation
exercises
his
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
remain
silent,
that
election
by
him
must
be
honored
and
all
questioning
must
cease
which
means
to
my
mind,
all
questioning
must
quit.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
not
forever.
mr.
carl
ziemba
true,
true,
true.
but
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
meant
in
miranda
that
the
police
are
to
quit
questioning
for
five
minutes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
no
but
the
language
is
there,
the
questioning
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
not
the
statement
that
the
questioning
must
cease,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
my
point
which
really
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
under
that
that
definition,
yes,
yes.
if
it
was
dicta
for
this
court
to
say
that
when
an
accused
under
custodial
interrogation,
he
elects
to
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
silence
and
it
must
be
honored
and
the
police
must
cease
questioning,
if
that
is
dicta,
i
am
relying
on
that.
and
i
think
that
this
court
meant
that
the
police
are
not
to
cease
for
five
minutes,
that
the
police
cannot
then
decide
how
long
they
will
cease
questioning
the
accused.
when
a
court
issues
an
injunction
to
a
man
to
stop
beating
his
wife
in
a
divorce
case,
the
court
does
not
mean
stop
for
five
minutes.
the
court
means
what
it
says,
stop.
if
indeed,
according
to
further
dicta
in
miranda
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
would
like
to
elevate
it
to
more
than
just
a
side
bar
comment.
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
true,
that
is
true
and
then
of
course
this
court
in
santobello,
when
confronted
with
a
situation
where
one
prosecutor
made
a
promise
to
a
criminal
defendant
regarding
his
plea
and
other
indistinct
prosecutor
appeared
with
that
same
defendant
in
open
court
that
the
promise
of
the
first
out
of
court
prosecutor
would
be
binding
on
the
in
court
prosecutor.
this
court
saying
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
but
this
court
said,
if
responsibility
could
be
evaded
that
way,
the
prosecution
would
have
designed
another
deceptive
contrivance
akin
to
those
we
condemned
in
mooney
versus
holohan
and
which
is
the
point
of
the
respondent
here.
if
the
strictures
of
miranda
can
be
avoided
by
the
simple
expedient
of
taking
the
accused
and
just
shuttling
him,
to
sending
him
from
one
police
officer
to
another
and
requiring
him
as
the
prosecutor
suggested,
each
and
every
time
a
police
officer
undertakes
the
question,
you
must
once
again
say,
i
want
to
remain
silent
under
my
privilege,
under
the
fifth
amendment,
then
eventually
you
are
going
to
overcome
and
over
bear
the
will
of
this
person
not
to
answer
questions.
if
indeed,
custodial
questioning
by
police
in
an
incommunicado
situation,
such
as
we
had
here,
is
inherently
coercive
and
if
you
allow
an
accused
the
opportunity
to
say
no,
i
do
not
want
to
answer
any
question
and
you
keep
coming
back
at
it
by
the
same
police
officer
or
other
police
officers
of
the
same
department,
propounding
questions
to
him,
are
you
not
further
exerting
upon
him
coercive
questions?
i
think
you
are.
mr.
carl
ziemba
none,
whatever
and
i
think
the
case
at
bar,
is
the
most
beautiful
illustration
of
that
principle
that
one
could
hope
to
find
for
this
reason.
you
have
the
arrest
of
the
respondent
here
on
the
basis
of
an
anonymous
telephone
call
without
a
warrant.
cowie
received
two
or
three
days
before
the
arrest,
he
could
not
be
sure,
a
telephone
call
from
a
person
he
had
never
heard
on
the
telephone
before
whose
name
he
did
not
get
and
did
not
know
at
all
and
this
person
said
that
the
respondent
was
mixed
up
or
involved
in
these
robberies
on
the
southeast
side
of
detroit
and
cowie
said
the
man
mentioned
the
blue
goose
bar
and
the
white
tower
restaurant
and
the
place
where
the
deceased
in
the
deceased
in
this
case
was
killed
and
cowie
went
out
picked
the
respondent
up
and
brought
him
downtown.
and
cowie
said,
i
questioned
him
only
on
blue
goose
because
i
learned
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
white
tower
and
then
cowie
turned
him
over,
turned
him
over
to
hill
for
further
questioning
in
the
leroy
williams
matter.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
think
so.
mr.
carl
ziemba
and
cowie
mentioned
the
white
tower
robbery.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
now,
if
hill
had
not
been
successful
in
the
leroy
williams
case,
how
many
other
police
officers
could
then
have
taken
the
respondent
and
questioned
him
about
the
other
crimes
occurring
in
the
south
east
area
of
detroit,
if
you
allow
one,
why
not
twenty?
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
think
it
would
be
more
rote
certainly,
but
in
principle
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
difference
at
all
because
mr.
chief
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
in
my
mind,
in
this
case
the
totality
of
circumstances
would
mean
the
completely
--
the
arrest
without
any
probable
cause
whatever
of
the
respondent.
the
failure
of
cowie
after
having
taken
the
respondent
downtown
to
conform
to
the
michigan
statute
which
requires
the
production
of
an
arrested
person
under
felony
before
a
judicial
officer
without
unnecessary
delay.
we
have
a
parallel
to
the
federal
rule
5
requirement
and
this
was
not
done
and
cowie
admitted
that
there
was
absolutely
no
physical
obstacle
to
his
taking
the
respondent
before
some
judicial
officer
of
the
court
which
is
located
just
across
the
street
from
the
detroit
police
headquarter.
instead
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
true
and
precisely
cowie
said,
i
did
not
take
him
over
because
i
did
not
think
i
had
enough.
further,
the
prosecutor
speaks
about
the
non-coercive
aspect
of
the
second
interrogation
of
the
respondent.
now,
further
dicta
in
miranda
seems
to
indicate
that
once
an
accused
has
exercised
his
right
under
the
fifth,
not
to
answer
any
questions,
there
might
be
a
waiver.
a
valid
subsequent
waiver,
but
the
mere
ritualistic
incantation
of
the
miranda
warnings
follow
thereby
by
a
confession,
in
and
of
itself,
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
waiver,
for
the
reason
that
if
there
were
no
confession,
there
would
be
no
question.
because
we
have
a
confession
we
are
confronted
with
the
problem
of
the
voluntariness
and
of
the
confession
and
of
the
coerce
submissions.
this
court,
according
to
dicta,
in
miranda,
states
that
if
indeed
there
is
a
confession
under
these
circumstances,
no
matter
what
the
testimony
of
the
police
is,
it
is
consistent
with
an
involuntary
statement
and
consistent
with
the
will
of
the
accused
being
overborne
by
the
procedures.
now,
you
had
in
this
particular
case
this
additional
factor
that
hill
when
he
approached
the
respondent
and
read
of
and
gave
him
the
miranda
warnings,
immediately
stated
to
the
respondent,
anthony
smith
has
confessed
and
he
puts
you
on
the
trigger,
you
are
the
shooter.
mr.
carl
ziemba
[laughter]
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
would
have
yelled
in
the
either
case.
mr.
carl
ziemba
louder,
yes.
[laughter]
i
would
point
to
another
additional
circumstance.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
am
sorry
sir?
mr.
carl
ziemba
this
is
the
respondent’s
position
that
cowie
had
a
duty
and
obligation
to
inform
hill
that
he,
cowie
had
advised
the
respondent
of
his
miranda
rights
and
that
the
respondent
had
elected
under
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
remain
silent.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
definitely.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
i
think
there
you
might
say
that
an
intervening
event
or
series
of
events,
both
the
causal
chain
between
the
first
interrogations
that
continued
custodial
retention
of
the
respondent
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
and
going
back
to
his
home
and
telling
father
or
mother
what
happened,
an
18-year-old
boy.
mr.
carl
ziemba
just
on
those
facts,
very
likely
i
would
not.
very
likely,
i
would
not.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
for
this
reason.
that
the
inherently
coercive
atmosphere
of
a
custodial
interrogation
continued
and
in
my
opinion
was
made
worse
by
the
fact
that
here
you
have
this,
let
us
assume,
an
18-year-old
boy
in
incommunicado
interrogation
by
a
police
officer
on
such
a
serious
charge
of
robbery,
your
honor,
he
is
frightened.
he
is
apprehensive.
there
is
nobody
there
to
advice
him
and
the
officers
says
it
is
my
obligation
to
inform
you,
young
man,
that
if
you
do
not
want
to
answer
any
questions,
you
have
the
perfect
right
to
remain
silent
and
i
will
honor
that
and
the
response
is,
oh!
my
heavens!
great!
i
do
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
about
any
robberies
and
he
is
relaxed
and
another
police
officer
comes
and
you
know
how
stern
police
officers
can
look
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
and
he
takes
him
down
and
says,
now
i
going
to
question
about
murder
sir.
not
only
that,
the
first
thing
he
does,
not
to
ask,
do
you
want
to
waive
your
rights?
he
does
not
ask
that
at
all.
he
does
not
ask,
do
you
want
an
attorney?
no,
the
first
thing
he
says,
anthony
smith
has
confessed
and
you
are
the
trigger
man.
now,
what
have
he
got
to
say
about
that.
that
is
in
effect
what
happened
and
do
we
not
have
the
situation
that
we
had
in
bram
versus
the
united
states
where
this
court
said,
what
do
you
expect
an
individual
to
in
those
circumstances
when
the
police
officer
comes
and
says,
look
this
is
what
we
have,
somebody
has
confessed
or
somebody
has
fully
incriminated
you
(voice
overlap).
it
calls
for
an
answer
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
think
so.
according
to
the
dicta
of
miranda
again,
because
this
court
has
said
that
when
an
accused
exercises
his
right
to
counsel,
he
says
i
want
counsel,
no
questioning
shall
continue
until
counsel
comes.
and
of
course,
there
are
those
cases
in
lower
courts,
well,
fahey
for
instance,
i
think
is
on
point,
where
incriminating
evidence
was
presented
to
a
defendant
and
were
not
for
that
incriminating
evidence,
he
would
not
have
confessed.
i
think
that
the
only
way
that
we
are
going
to
--
if
indeed,
if
indeed
there
is
merit
to
the
rule
that
the
police
must
warn
a
suspect
in
custodial
interrogation
that
he
has
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
if
we
give
the
right
to
the
accused
to
remain
silent,
the
only
way
that
we
can
make
that
right
meaningful
is
to
require
the
police
to
absolutely
desist
from
any
further
questioning
of
that
defendant
before
he
is
presented
to
a
judicial
officer,
so
that
the
judicial
officer
may
say,
“sir,
you
are
charged
or
at
least
accused
of
a
very
serious
crime.
you
have
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
an
appointment
of
counsel,
if
you
have
no
money
for
counsel,
do
you
want
an
attorney?”
i
remember
when
i
was
on
the
same
staff
of
the
wayne
county
prosecutor’s
office
a
number
of
years
ago,
i
happened
to
be
the
senior
man
in
the
office
this
afternoon,
two
homicide
detectives
brought
a
middle-aged
man
in
for
me
to
take
his
formal
statement
on
a
homicide
he
had
done
and
his
paramour
common-law-wife
and
i
started
out
by
giving
him
his
rights.
and
i
said,
“sir,
you
are
a
citizen
of
this
country.
if
you
want
a
lawyer,
if
you
do
not
have
money,
i
will
go
across
the
street
and
have
a
judge
appoint
one
for
you,
do
you
want
one?”
he
said,
no.
but
i
was
not
convinced
with
his
answer
that
he
was
telling
me
what
he
really
felt
in
his
heart.
and
i
said,
“mr.
smith,
if
that
was
his
name,
we
will
leave
the
room
for
give
minutes
and
you
think
about
it
and
tell
me.”
and
so
we
did,
the
court
stenographer
and
the
two
detectives
and
i,
when
we
came
back
in,
i
said,
“sir,
have
you
made
up
your
mind?”
and
he
was
looking
out
the
window
and
he
turned
his
face
toward
me
and
he
said,
“are
you
sure,
i
will
not
get
beat
up,
if
i
ask
for
an
attorney?”
it
is
my
opinion
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
read
off
from
a
form
to
a
person
who
is
in
custody.
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
you
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer
if
you
do
not
have
money
for
a
lawyer,
the
court
will
appoint,
any
time
you
want
to
interrupt
the
questioning
you
may
–-
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
what
is
that
mr.
justice?
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
carl
ziemba
why
is
it
barred
by
miranda?
mr.
carl
ziemba
because
its
purpose
and
its
design
is
to
overbear
the
will
of
the
defendant
who
has
already
stated
that
he
wants
to
exercise
his
counsel
constitutional
right
to
remain
silent.
it
is
calculated
to
throw
the
fight
of
heaven
into
his
whole
so
that
he
will
confess
or
at
least
to
make
some
incriminating
statements.
and
if
we
permit
that
mr.
justice,
if
the
man
says,
i
do
not
want
to
say
anything,
then
five
minutes
later
the
same
police
officer
comes
back
and
says
not
only
do
we
have
your
rob
partner,
but
we
have
an
eyewitness
who
says
that
you
pulled
the
trigger
and
the
things
mount,
the
things
mount.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
the
record
indicates
that
in
all
likelihood,
the
second
police
officer
hill,
did
not
have
a
confession
from
anthony
smith.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
and
this
was
robbery
connected
homicide.
mr.
carl
ziemba
but
it
was
a
felony
murder
as
we
call
it
in
michigan
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
do
not
think
that.
mr.
carl
ziemba
and
again,
we
get
–-
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
i
still
think
that
there
is
that
danger
that
we
will
open
the
door
to
all
sort
of
subterfuge.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
but
mr.
justice,
i
do
pray
you
to
consider
that
we
here
are
speaking
as
---
mr.
carl
ziemba
if
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
my
answer
is
that
we
are
discussing
this
thing
as
trained
lawyers.
we
may
know
the
semantic
differences
between
answering
question
about
robberies,
answering
questions
about
homicide,
but
here
you
have
an
18-year-old
boy
who
i
think
when
he
said,
i
do
not
want
to
answer
the
questions
is
in
effect
saying,
i
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
right
you
say,
i
have
to
remain
silent.
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
fair
for
us
to
hold
this
18-year-old
untrained
in
legal
distinctions
to
a
precise
liberal
interpretation
of
his
answer.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
no.
mr.
carl
ziemba
absolutely
not.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that
if
we
can
deter
that
the
statement
made
by
the
accused
is
indeed
voluntary,
is
something
that
he
decided
without
any
pressuring,
any
coercion
to
make,
then,
yes,
it
is
voluntary.
but
when
we
speak
of
totality
of
circumstances,
i
think
we
have
to
look
that
at
number
one,
arrested
with
utterly
no
probable
cause.
number
two,
not
taken
before
a
judicial
officer
as
required
by
the
michigan
statute
equivalent
to
rule
5.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
of
course
that
has
been
a
disappointment
to
me
because
all
of
these
grounds
were
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
behalf
of
the
respondent.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
certainly
hope
so.
certainly,
i
would
not
want
because
all
of
these
grounds
separately
and
together
were
presented
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
trial
court
also.
in
other
words,
these
very
things
which
i
advance
to
this
court,
the
arrest
without
probable
cause
of
violation
of
the
michigan
equivalent
of
rule
5
(a).
you
might
say
the
trickery
involved
and
this
bram
versus
united
states
sort
of
situation,
all
of
these
were
preserved
from
the
trial
level
onwards.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes?
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
not,
no
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
in
terms
of
being
beaten
out
or
sweat
it
out
of
him,
no.
mr.
carl
ziemba
this
is
true
mr.
justice
i
do
not
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
well
i
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
true.
what
i
did
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
present
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
brown
versus
illinois
argument.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
would,
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
it
was
not
addressed
by
the
court.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes,
yes,
i
will
agree
with
that,
but
i
make
the
further
point
that
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
should
decide
--
well,
the
point
surely
is
that
after
the
second
miranda
warnings
were
given,
the
question
is
did
the
respondent
waive
his
right
to
remain
silent?
is
that
not
the
operative
question?
and
i
think
we
cannot
decide
that
unless
we
examine
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
arrest
without
probable
cause
is
a
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
well.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
can
because
we
have
the
same
provision
in
the
michigan
constitution
of
1963
as
we
have
in
the
fifth
constitution
of
the
federal
constitution,
certainly.
mr.
carl
ziemba
in
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
really
did
not
touch
upon,
i
predicated
my
entire
argument
on
the
federal
constitution
i
must
admit
that.
i
did
not
mention
the
equivalent
provision
of
the
michigan
constitution
of
1963,
although
i
could
have
and
i
may
assure
this
court
that
every
opportunity
in
the
future,
i
shall.[laughter]
mr.
carl
ziemba
that
is
right.
that
is
true
mr.
justice.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
do
agree
that
the
opinion
can
be
interpreted
as
a
per
se
rule.
i
do
think
that
it
is
a
good
rule
to
adapt,
a
per
se
rule.
the
miranda
decision
seems
to
set
forth,
if
it
is
in
dicta.
the
per
se
rules
that
if
the
warnings
are
not
given,
we
are
not
going
to
examine
into
the
knowledge
of
the
accused
if
the
warnings
are
not
given,
the
confession
goes
down
and
we
are
going
to
make
it
and
i
think
miranda
also
said
per
se.
if
a
man
asks
for
an
attorney
and
the
questioning
continues,
the
confession
goes
on
and
i
think
that
it
will
be
well
for
us
to
adapt
the
rule,
per
se.
once
an
accused
under
custodial
interrogation
exercises
his
right
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
remain
silent,
the
police
must
stop
questioning
and
any
violation
of
that
rule,
that
is
any
coming
back
to
that
defendant
between
before
some
judicial
process
intervenes
such
as
his
arraignment
in
court
or
even
his
just
presentation
in
court
so
that
he
may
be
advised
by
the
court
of
his
rights.
it
completely
taints
--
the
confession
was
unconstitutional
and
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
but
certainly
he
may
be
questioned
of
it.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
with
killing
the
prisoner?
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
about
killing
the
prisoner,
certainly.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no,
i
did
not
say
indefinitely
mr.
justice.
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
feel
some
intervening
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
said
until
some
intervening
judicial.
in
other
words,
we
would
not
be
faced
with
this
situation
if
the
first
detective
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
this
is
my
point
mr.
justice.
we
would
not
be
here
if
the
first
detective
cowie
had
after
booking
the
respondent
walked
him
over
to
the
court
building
across
the
street
and
presented
him
to
some
judge
and
have
the
judge
say,
young
man
you
have
these
rights,
do
you
want
an
attorney
and
if
the
respondent
had
consulted
with
an
attorney
or
if
after
cowie
determined
that,
he
had
nothing
to
hold
the
respondent
for
and
having
arrested
him
for
these
particular
crimes
on
which
he
had
nothing
to
hold,
had
released
him,
we
would
not
be
here,
you
see.
mr.
carl
ziemba
then
i
would
say
it
is
a
new
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
no.
mr.
carl
ziemba
well,
of
course
in
justice
marshall’s
hypothesis,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
prisoner
wining
his
freedom.
he
is
in
prison
as
i
understand
your
hypothesis.
he
cannot
walk
home,
you
see,
after
having
been
questioned
about
the
first
offense,
but
our
respondent
could
have
and
he
should
have
walked
home
after
refusing
to
answer
any
questions
because
the
detective
who
arrested
him
had
absolutely
nothing
to
hold
him
for.
mr.
carl
ziemba
my
answer
is
that
it
is
a
difficult
question
for
the
reason
that
we
have
this
added,
we
have
this
added
factor
that
a
prisoner
in
state's
prison,
i
take
it
you
mean
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
carl
ziemba
if
mosley
had
been
taken
back
to
lockup
and
had
murdered
somebody?
mr.
carl
ziemba
i
really
do
not
know.
i
really
do
no
know
the
answer
to
that
one.
mr.
carl
ziemba
about
the
second
murder?
mr.
carl
ziemba
can
he
go
back
to
his
first
one?
let
us
put
it
his
way,
certainly,
i
think
you
will
agree
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
mosley
had
been
questioned
about
the
first
and
had
been
locked
up
and
had
murdered
somebody
before
the
first
detective
questioned
him
and
told
the
first
detective,
i
do
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
about
any
killings,
certainly,
he
could
not
be
then
questioned
about
the
killing
inside
the
jail.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes.
mr.
carl
ziemba
yes
and
i
would
answer
that
of
the
top
my
head
that
question
could
with
propriety
ensue
on
the
second
killing,
but
after
exercise
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
on
the
first
offense.
the
police
officers
could
not
go
back
to
that
interrogation.
any
further
questions?
mr.
carl
ziemba
thank
you.
