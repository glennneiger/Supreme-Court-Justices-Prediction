justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
reject
the
per
se
rule
which
you
said
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
has
adapted,
would
we
not
ordinarily
simply
tell
michigan
court
of
appeals
that
was
not
a
proper
standard
for
reversing
on
the
federal
constitution
and
then
let
them
make
an
assessment
as
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
just
dicta
that
you
are
quoting
from
miranda,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
that
had
not
in
fact
happened
to
miranda?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
it
was
dicta,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that
definition
of
dicta
was
any
observation
by
the
court
made
that
was
not
necessary
for
decision
on
the
particular
facts
before
it?
well,
(voice
overlap)
99.5%
of
the
miranda
opinion
is
dicta?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
concede
then
that
you
are
relying
on
dicta?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
decision,
was
it,
that
the
totality
of
circumstances
indicated
involuntary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
presumably
if
we
reversed
on
your
opponents
point,
they
would
still
be
open
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
khalil,
when
you
say
totality
of
circumstances,
you
mean
totality
of
circumstances
as
to
whether
the
miranda
rights
have
been
waived
and
not
totality
of
circumstances
as
to
whether
the
confession
is
involuntary
under
pre-miranda
instead?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
there
be
an
infringement
of
one's
miranda
rights
that
is
in
the
language
of
justice
stewart,
sufficiently
gross,
so
that
it
would
require
exclusion
of
a
confession
under
miranda,
but
nonetheless,
the
statement
would
be
voluntary
under
the
pre-miranda
holdings
of
this
court?
