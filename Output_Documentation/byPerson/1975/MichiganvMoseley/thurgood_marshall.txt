justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
reason
for
doing
this
twice,
giving
him
the
miranda
warnings
twice,
what
was
the
reason
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
not
know?
it
was
on
the
same
police
department,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
in
the
same
building,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
come
to
different
floor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
moving
him
around
from
place
to
place
and
then
all
of
the
sudden
you
give
him
another
warning?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
knew
that
when
he
was
taken
from
fourth
floor
to
the
ninth
floor,
did
he
say
he
did
not
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
they
have
moved
him
around?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
they
gave
him
miranda
warning,
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
miranda
about
taking
from
place
to
place
and
giving
the
warnings
every
time
they
took
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
of
course
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
a
little
bit
about
that
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
remember
that.
that
was
state
and
federal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
all
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
question
to
me
as
to
why
you
gave
the
same
warning
twice,
the
same
interrogating
or
agency
gave
him
the
same
warning
twice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
if
you
thought
he
was
going
to
change
his
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
you
have
given
six
of
them,
would
that
not
be
penalizing
him?
you
should
live
him
alone
after
the
first
one
as
i
read
miranda?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
read
miranda?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
he
had
not
done
that,
you
would
not
have
any
case,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
would
you
please
not
characterize
what
i
am
thinking?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
westover
was
the
state
court
prosecutors
and
the
federal
prosecutors,
that
is
entirely
different,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
do
not
see
any
difference
in
the
state
and
federal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
westover
was
deliberately
(inaudible)
opinion
that
one
was
federal
and
one
was
state.
i
am
not
familiar
with
westover.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
the
best
way
to
remember
a
case
is
to
lose
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
the
point
that
one
was
federal
and
one
was
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
because
he
did
not
have
anything
to
hold
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
khalil
says
that
when
he
was
there
the
second
time
with
the
second
officer,
if
he
had
not
given
the
miranda
ruling,
he
would
be
yelling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
be
your
answer
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
what
was
the
second
man
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
second
officer
who
questioned
him,
what
was
he
to
do?
he
could
not
question
him
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ziemba,
i
got
those
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ziemba
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
mind
getting
this
for
a
minute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
officer
that
was
questioning
him
and
he
says,
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
any
robbery,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
same
officer
comes
back
five
minutes
later.
he
goes
out
the
room
and
comes
back.
he
says,
oh!
by
the
way,
your
co-conspirator
says
you
are
the
one
that
had
the
gun,
does
that
make
you
change
your
mind?
he
says,
oh!
yes,
i
will
not
talk
now,
is
that
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
going
back
to
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
worried
me
considerably.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
the
officer
comes
back
and
says,
your
co-conspirator
says
you
were
the
guy
with
the
gun.
do
you
have
anything
to
say?
that
is
not
really
a
question,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
is
it
barred
by
miranda?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
can
you
not
argue
all
of
this
as
being
contrary
to
the
law
and
constitution
of
the
state
of
michigan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
when
you
get
back,
if
you
go
back
that
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
argued
the
whole
thing
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
so
far
as
this
man
who
is
in
prison,
like
this
man
as
being
held
said
i
will
not
talk
and
he
cannot
be
questioned
in
the
next
day,
he
kills
another
inmate,
that
he
cannot
be
questioned
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
he
has
claimed
his
miranda
rulings
today,
yesterday
and
he
says
i
refuse
to
talk
and
the
next
day,
he
kills
a
prisoner?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
is
charged
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
cannot
be
questioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
he
be
questioned?
you
said
this
goes
on
indefinitely?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
it
applied
to
other
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
no
judicial
like
here
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
my
case
it
was,
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
this
prisoner?
i
am
talking
about
mosley?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
ask
you
one
thing.
if
we
should
agree
with
you
and
remand
it
and
the
michigan
court
says
that
this
violates
michigan
law,
that
would
be
alright?
