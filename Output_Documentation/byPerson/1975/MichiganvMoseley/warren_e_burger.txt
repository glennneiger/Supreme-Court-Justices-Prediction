chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-653,
michigan
against
mosley.
mr.
khalil,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
he
had
any
doubt
about
whether
the
warning
had
been
given
or
what
had
proceeded,
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
the
prudent
thing
was
to
give
the
warning
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
some
impression
to
what
you
said
earlier
that
you
had
in
mind
a
remand
to
reconsider
under
the
totality
of
the
evidence
approach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ziemba.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
referring
an
injunction
with
something
like
a
side
bar
comment
in
the
miranda
opinion
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
harris
against
new
york,
we
indicated
that
we
were
separating
the
dicta
from
the
substantive
aspects
of
the
holding,
did
we
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
not
on
the
miranda
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
makes
no
difference
if
the
subject
matter
of
the
conversation
is
totally
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
indicate
in
the
last
paragraph
of
your
brief,
if
you
stand
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
rule
then
there
might
be
quite
a
different
approach
if
there
were
ten
such
or
even
five
such
episodes
in
sequence
as
compared
with
two,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
that
not
what
the
totality
of
circumstances
means?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
after
the
interrogation
on
the
robbery
had
been
concluded
by
detective
number
one
and
he
concluded
that
he
did
not
have
enough
to
hold
him
or
send
him
across
the
street
for
the
preliminary
hearing,
but
excused
him
and
he
went
on
home
and
then
the
second
detective
came
along
and
said
i
wanted
to
talk
to
that
man
before
he
left
that,
but
he
is
gone
so
they
send
the
police
car
on
to
his
home,
pick
him
up,
and
bring
him
down.
now,
i
assume
you
would
agree
that
they
must
give
him
a
miranda
warning
then,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
warning
that
was
two
or
three
hours
or
a
number
of
hours
old,
would
not
carryover?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
intervention,
you
mean
going
outside
the
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
this
hypothetical
case
that
i
am
suggesting,
in
case
it
might
help
clear
some
of
these
things
up.
he
comes
back
to
the
station
house
and
then
from
that
point
on,
everything
that
occurred
was
just
exactly
as
it
occurred
in
this
case.
do
you
think
you
would
have
the
kind
of
case
or
any
kind
of
a
case
here
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
put
your
whole
case
or
large
part
of
your
case
on
the
absence
of
the
intervening
breaking
the
chain
of
events?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
a
plain
murder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
a
plain
murder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
suggest
that
that
would
bar
him
forever
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
from
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
ten
minutes
later,
before
they
released
him,
if
they
were
going
to
release
him
for
lack
of
evidence,
suppose
he
said
i
have
changed
my
mind.
i
think
maybe
you
give
me
a
break
if
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
and
so
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
whole
story,
anything
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
khalil,
you
have
eight
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
stewart
has
the
opinion
to
announce
in
michigan
against
moseley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
