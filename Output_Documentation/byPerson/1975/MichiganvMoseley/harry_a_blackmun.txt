justice
harry
a.
blackmun
unless
there
is
the
state
that
will
penalize
for
overdoing
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
follow
through
at
this
point.
brown
against
illinois
is
a
little
different
than
this
case
in
the
sense
that
there
as
i
recall,
the
arrest
was
concededly
an
illegal
one.
if
you
should
prevail
on
the
argument
you
made
so
far,
do
you
think
we
should
nevertheless
remand
the
case
for
determination
of
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
arrest
and
hence
the
implication
of
brown
and
wong
sun?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
would
be
content
with
that
kind
--?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
every
state
has
a
different
name?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
his
custody
continues
unbroken?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
justice
marshall’s
question
and
i
wish
you
would
answer
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
what
is
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question?
