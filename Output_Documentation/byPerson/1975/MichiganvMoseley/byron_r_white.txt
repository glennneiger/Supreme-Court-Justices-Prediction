justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
agreement
i
take
it
would
be
the
same
whatever
he
knew?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
not
critical,
you
do
not
think
that
is
a
critical
fact
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
should
we
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
second
officer
knew
that
he
had
declined
to
answer
and
he
had
decided
to
exercise
his
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
has
authority
in
detroit
to
prescribe
the
police
investigating
procedures?
is
it
the
city
government
or
the
city
council
or
the
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
has
no
authority
or
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
attorney
general’s’
office
has
no
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
a
case
like
this,
it
is
the
local
prosecutor’s
office
has
the
authority
to
handle
the
appellate
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
attorney
general
has
no
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
to
bringing
the
case
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
the
defendant
said
was
though
was
that
he
do
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
about
any
robberies?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
was
still
a
homicide.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
he
is
asking
about
some
crime
that
was
not
connected
with
the
robbery
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
maybe
but
it
is
somewhat
of
an
exaggeration
of
what
the
defendant
claimed
when
he
said
i
do
not
want
to
answer
the
questions
about
robberies.
it
is
a
little
exaggeration
to
say,
he
said
that
he
did
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
in
your
case
to
say,
he
refused
to
answer
any
more
questions
about
robberies
and
the
police
came
back
and
asked
him
about
a
robbery?
that
is
assuming
you
still
got
the
cases
before
us,
has
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
that
you
are
but
you
did
not
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
totality
of
it
all?
