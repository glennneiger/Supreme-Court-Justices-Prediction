justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
mr.
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
hill
knew
about
the
earlier
interrogation
by
cowie?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
show
whether
or
not
he
knew
that
mosley
had
been
interrogated
by
cowie?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
hill’s
testimony
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
direct
contact
as
i
understand
it
between
cowie
and
hill?
cowie
finished
about
4
p.m.
and
mosley
was
in
the
turn
somewhere
and
then
it
was
not
until
about
6
p.m.
that
he
was
taken
to
the
ninth-floor
and
interrogated
by
hill,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
know
that
--
about
the
earlier
interrogation
and
he
did
know
that
mosley
had
refused
to
discuss
the
robberies?
justice
potter
stewart
he
denied
any
implications?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might,
it
might.
in
any
event,
you
do
not
know
what
might
matter
or
not,
but
in
any
event
you
say,
the
record
is
clear
that
hill
testified
at
least
that
he
did
not
that
know
that
mosley
had
exercised
his
right
to
remain
silent
in
the
earlier
interrogation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
a
walker
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
case
in
michigan,
the
walker
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
walker
case
is
a
michigan
case,
not
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
ours
is
walker.
justice
potter
stewart
very
good.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
mean
not
forever
obviously?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
if
he
is
released,
a
year
later
and
apprehended
on
some
separate
crime
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
questioned
him
on
blue
goose
which
was
the
name
of
the
café
where
the
robberies
had
been?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
responsible
for
white
tower?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
what
you
are
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ziemba?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
your
contention
in
this
case,
is
it,
that
his
confession
was
an
involuntary
confession
under
the
due
process
standard
that
existed
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
up
until
1966,
when
miranda
case
was
decided,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
it
is
involuntary
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
in
terms
of
any
of
the
decisions
decided
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
no?
justice
potter
stewart
totality,
but
not
totality
to
show
that
it
was
an
involuntary
confession
under
the
due
process
standard.
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
made
it
inadmissible
is
your
claim
because
of
the
involuntary
or
because
of
the
warrantless
arrest
without
probable
cause
because
of
the
violation
of
the
michigan
equivalent
of
rule
5
and
because
of
the
trickery,
but
that
totality
did
not
make
it
an
involuntary
confession
as
i
understand
your
claim
under
the
due
process
standard
of
pre-miranda
constitutional
status?
justice
potter
stewart
despite
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
of
my
colleagues
that
if
we
should
decide
this
case
against
you,
there
might
well
still
be
open
--
it
might
well
be
said
what
this
court
should
do
would
be
to
remand
it
to
the
michigan
appellate
court
to
consider
the
other
claims
that
you
made
there
that
it
did
not
consider?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
hope
you
did
not
that
opportunity
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
then
if
a
murder
had
been
committed,
then
that
would
justice
marshall’s
hypothetical
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
truly
he
could
be
apprehended
and
questioned
about
that
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
answer
is
pretty
clear,
is
it
not?
as
a
practical
matter,
it
should
not
be
difficult.
of
course,
he
could
be
questioned
about
it,
could
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
hypothetical
question,
this
was
a
later
killing
after
the
interrogation,
that
is
what
makes
it
wholly
different
from
the
present
case?
justice
potter
stewart
your
point,
a
gross
deliberate
violation
of
the
letter
and
spirit
of
miranda
than
the
confession
should
be
inadmissible
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
in
fact
involuntary,
in
fact
and
in
law
involuntary
under
old
due
process
standard?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
miranda
case
was
not
decided
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
you
cite
the
cases
so
holding
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
those
cases
as
you
say
that
they
are
typified
by
refusing
to
take
no
as
an
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
there
is
not
a
holding
that
they
were
involuntary
confessions
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
a
way
of
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
michigan.
the
respondent,
richard
moseley,
was
arrested
in
detroit,
michigan
on
the
early
afternoon
of
april
8,
1971,
in
connection
with
robberies
that
had
recently
occurred
at
blue
goose
bar
and
the
white
tower
restaurant
on
that
city's
lower
east
side.
the
arresting
officer,
detective
james
cowie
of
the
armed
robbery
section
of
the
detroit
police
department,
brought
mosley
to
the
robbery
and
breaking
and
entering
bureau
of
the
police
department,
which
was
located
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
departmental
headquarters
building.
the
officer
advised
mosley
of
his
rights
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
miranda
against
arizona,
and
he
had
him
read
and
sign
the
department's
constitutional
rights
notification
certificate.
after
filling
out
the
necessary
arrest
papers,
officer
cowie
began
questioning
mosley
about
the
robbery
of
the
white
tower
restaurant.
when
mosley
said
he
did
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
about
the
robberies,
cowie
promptly
ceased
the
interrogation.
at
no
time
during
the
questioning
did
mosley
indicate
a
desire
to
consult
with
a
lawyer,
and
there
is
no
claim
that
the
procedures
followed
to
this
point
did
not
fully
comply
with
the
strictures
of
the
miranda
opinion.
mosley
was
then
taken
to
a
ninth-floor
cell
block.
shortly
after
6
o’clock
in
the
evening,
detective
hill
of
the
detroit
police
department
homicide
bureau
brought
mosley
from
the
cell
block
to
the
fifth-floor
office
of
the
homicide
bureau
for
questioning
about
the
fatal
shooting
of
a
man
named
leroy
williams.
williams
had
been
killed
in
january
of
1971,
during
a
holdup
attempt
outside
the
101
ranch
bar
in
detroit.
mosley
had
not
been
arrested
on
this
charge
nor
interrogated
about
it
by
detective
cowie.
before
questioning
mosley
about
this
homicide,
detective
hill
carefully
advised
him
of
his
so-called
miranda
rights.
mosley
read
the
notification
form
both
silently
and
aloud,
and
detective
hill
then
read
and
explained
the
warnings
to
him
and
had
him
sign
the
form.
mosley
at
first
denied
any
involvement
in
the
williams
murder,
but
after
the
officer
told
him
that
and
accomplice
had
confessed
to
participating
in
the
killing,
and
had
named
him
moseley
as
the
trigger
man,
mosley
made
a
statement
implicating
himself
in
the
homicide.
the
interrogation
by
detective
hill
lasted
approximately
15
minutes,
and
at
no
time
during
its
course
did
mosley
ask
to
consult
with
a
lawyer
or
indicate
that
he
did
not
want
to
discuss
the
homicide.
in
short,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
procedures
followed
during
detective
hill's
interrogation
of
mosley,
standing
alone,
did
not
fully
comply
with
the
strictures
of
the
miranda
opinion.
moseley
was
subsequently
charged
with
first
degree
murder.
before
the
trial,
he
moved
to
suppress
his
incriminating
statement
on
a
number
of
grounds,
among
them
a
claim
that
under
the
doctrine
of
the
miranda
case,
it
was
constitutionally
impermissible
for
detective
hill
to
question
him
about
the
williams
murder
after
he
had
told
detective
cowie
that
he
did
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
about
the
robberies.
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
after
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
the
incriminating
statement
was
subsequently
introduced
in
evidence
against
mosley
at
his
trial.
the
jury
convicted
mosley
of
first-degree
murder,
and
the
court
imposed
a
mandatory
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
on
appeal
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
mosley
renewed
his
previous
objections
to
the
use
of
his
incriminating
statement
in
evidence.
the
appellate
court
reversed
the
judgment
of
conviction,
holding
that
detective
hill's
interrogation
of
mosley
had
been
a
per
se
violation
of
the
miranda
doctrine.
accordingly,
without
reaching
mosley's
other
contentions,
the
court
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
with
instructions
that
mosley's
statement
be
suppressed
as
evidence.
after
a
further
appeal
was
denied
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
the
state
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
here
and
we
granted
the
petition
because
of
the
important
constitutional
questions
presented.
for
the
reasons
elaborated
in
some
details
in
the
court’s
written
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
admission
in
evidence
of
mosley's
incriminating
statement
did
not
violate
the
principles
of
miranda
versus
arizona.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
separated
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
