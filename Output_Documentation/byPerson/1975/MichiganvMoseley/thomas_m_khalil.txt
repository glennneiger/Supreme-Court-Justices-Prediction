mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
to
this
court,
the
question
of
whether
miranda
versus
arizona
and
westover
versus
united
states
precludes
any
good
faith
non-coercive
interrogation,
subsequent
to
a
defendant’s
exercise
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
an
additional
question
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
is
whether
or
not
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
remain
silent
relative
to
one
crime,
per
se
precludes
any
subsequent
interrogation
relative
to
a
separate
and
distinct
crime.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
arise
out
of
the
first-degree
murder
of
a
man
by
the
name
of
leroy
williams.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
mr.
richard
bert
mosley
was
arrested
on
april
8,
1971
at
about
1:05
in
the
afternoon.
he
was
arrested
in
connection
with
some
unrelated
robberies,
that
is
to
say
robberies
unrelated
to
the
murder
for
which
he
was
convicted.
the
arresting
officer
in
this
case,
detective
sergeant
james
cowie,
initially
interviewed
the
defendant
in
this
case
for
about
20
minutes.
that
interview
was
undertaken
after
a
full
advise
of
rights
was
given
to
the
respondent
and
after
a
waiver
of
those
rights
was
obtained.
after
detective
cowie
began
to
interrogate
the
defendant
in
this
case,
mr.
cowie
began
asking
mr.
mosley
about
the
white
tower
robbery,
one
of
the
robberies
for
which
he
was
arrested.
at
that
point
in
time,
mr.
mosley
said
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
any
robberies.
detective
cowie
immediately
terminated
the
question
and
did
not
see
the
defendant
again,
except
to
tell
him
that
he
would
be
questioned
later
by
detective
sergeant
hill
of
the
homicide
section.
mr.
mosley
was
then
taken
to
the
ninth-floor
lockup
area
at
about
4
o’clock
in
the
afternoon.
during
this
time,
detective
sergeant
hill
of
the
detroit
homicide
section
had
been
talking
with
an
accomplice
in
the
leroy
williams
murder,
a
man
by
the
name
of
anthony
smith.
mr.
smith
at
about
4
o’clock
or
so
made
certain
statements
to
mr.
hill,
implicating
mr.
mosley
as
the
shooter
in
the
leroy
william
slaying.
detective
hill
thereafter
at
about
06:25
in
the
evening
took
mr.
mosley
from
the
ninth-floor
lockup
area
and
took
him
down
to
the
fifth-floor
homicide
section.at
that
point
in
time,
detective
hill
gave
mr.
mosley
his
rights
in
explicit
detail,
specifically
mr.
hill
had
the
defendant
mosley
read
his
rights
to
himself
then
detective
hill
had
mr.
mosley
read
the
rights
out
loud
so
that
detective
hill
could
ascertain
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
defendant
could
read.
detective
hill
then
read
the
miranda
rights
back
to
mr.
mosley,
explaining
in
detail
all
of
the
points
contained
on
that
document.
at
that
point,
mr.
mosley
testified
that
he
fully
understood
his
rights
and
in
fact
he
signed
the
rights
form,
informing
him
that
he
had
been
informed
of
his
rights.
defendant
mosley
testified
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
well,
your
honor
in
this
case,
i
think
that
detective
hill
did
not
know
that
mr.
mosley
had
earlier
exercised
any
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
it
was
in
a
different
floor,
your
honor.
it
was
in
the
same
building,
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
because
it
was
a
different
bureau,
your
honor,
investigating
the
crime.
it
was
the
homicide
section.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
not
at
all,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
defendant
in
this
case
testified
that
knew
he
was
not
being
taken
place
to
place.
the
defendant
in
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
exactly
where
they
took
them
here.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
they
took
them
to
the
lockup
area,
your
honor
and
brought
them
back
them
for
further
interrogation.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
because
detective
hill
was
going
to
interrogate
him
on
the
leroy
williams
murder
and
under
the
doctrine
enunciated
by
this
court
in
miranda
versus
arizona,
the
rights
were
prerequisite
to
any
interrogation.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
in
the
companion
case
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
in
the
companion
case,
your
honor,
there
is
discussion
of
that
particular
point.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
westover
versus
united
states.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
this
case,
we
do
not
feel
that
it
makes
a
difference.
what
should
make
a
difference
in
this
case
is
what
the
circumstances
in
this
particular
case
show.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
was
a
change
in
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
state
in
this
case
should
be
commended
for
the
reasonable
efforts
of
the
law
enforcement
personnel
that
are
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
well,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
way
that
we
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
not
the
way
we
read
miranda,
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
way
that
the
majority
of
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states
that
have
addressed
that
precise
question
read
miranda.
there
is
nothing
in
miranda
in
our
opinion
that
would
adapt
a
per
se
rule
in
every
case.
that
basically
is
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
and
that
is
what
we
assert
in
this
court
was
error.
rather
the
test
should
have
been
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
did
the
defendant
in
fact
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive
his
rights
under
miranda
versus
arizona.
that
is
to
say,
did
he
understand
those
rights
and
did
he
waive
those
rights.
now,
in
the
test
that
we
proposed
and
in
the
test
that
we
think
has
been
the
rule
since
miranda,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
must
be
considered
in
any
given
case
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
act
that
he
had
been
questioned
earlier
is
merely
one
of
the
circumstances
to
be
considered.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
khalil,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
yes,
your
honor,
the
record
indicates
that
detective
hill
did
not
know
that
mr.
mosley
had
exercised
his
right
to
remain
silent
relative
to
the
robberies.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
yes,
your
honor.
he
knew
that
detective
cowie
had
interrogated
him
and
according
to
hill,
he
had
understood
that
mosley
had
denied
implications
“in
any
robberies.”
he
did
not
know
that
he
exercised
his
right
to
remain
silent.
i
might
note,
your
honor,
that
initially
mr.
mosley
did
not
remain
silent.
he
signed
the
waiver
rights
form
in
this
case
and
only
later
waived
those
rights.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
hill’s
testimony
and
it
is
also
mr.
cowie’s
testimony
that
he
did
not
tell
detective
hill
about
the
prior
exercise.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
he
was
taken
to
the
fifth-floor
from
the
ninth
and
interrogated
by
hill.
that
is
correct,
but
there
was
some
contact
between
hill
and
cowie.
in
fact,
detective
hill
discovered
the
presence
of
mr.
mosley
in
the
headquarters
building
from
lieutenant
dam
(ph)
who
was
then
on
duty
and
from
detective
cowie.
however,
there
was
no
elaborate
discussion
as
to
what
had
occurred
between
cowie
and
mosley.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
he
did
not
know
that
specifically,
your
honor.
he
knew
that,
as
far
as
detective
hill
knew,
mr.
mosley
had
declined
or
denied
any
implication
in
the
robberies.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
he
had
remained
silent
earlier
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
well,
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the
record
is
clear
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
earlier
exercised
his
rights,
but
it
does
not
matter
for
purposes
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
what
detective
hill
did
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
not
necessarily
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
the
fact
that
detective
hill
did
not
know,
i
think
goes
to
the
fact
that
it
was
bona
fide
investigation.
it
was
a
good
faith
police
effort
by
detective
hill
in
approaching
defendant
in
this
case.
now,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
did
not
even
reach
that
issue.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
court
intended
under
miranda
versus
arizona
to
hold
that
the
mere
approaching
of
a
defendant
a
second
time
was
per
se
coercive
and
i
would
submit
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
could
in
any
way
be
substantiated
or
justified.
that
the
only
way
that
this
case
could
have
been
reversed
and
indeed
was
reversed
was
based
on
the
per
se
rule
which
as
i
indicated
is
contrary
to
the
majorities
of
the
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states,
both
state
and
federal.
now,
it
is
our
position
here
that
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
should
have
done
was
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
interrogations
here
and
indeed
look
at
the
waivers
in
this
case.
now,
the
waivers
here
razor
clean.
there
is
no
tenable
argument
that
could
be
made
that
these
waivers
were
not
knowingly,
intelligently
and
voluntarily
made.
now,
no
questioning
whatever
occurred
in
this
case
prior
to
obtaining
of
a
waiver
by
either
detective
cowie
or
detective
hill.
that
is
to
say
there
was
no
coercion
used,
no
trickery
used,
nothing
along
that
vein
in
order
to
get
a
waiver
in
this
case.
the
waivers
were
constitutionally
procured
in
this
case
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
fact
the
confession
was
constitutionally
procured
in
this
case.
now,
i
might
point
out
for
the
court’s
reference
that
our
assertion
as
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
should
be
the
test
in
this
case,
is
apparently
agreed
upon
by
the
respondent
here.
now,
at
pages
21
and
31
of
his
brief
and
at
page
44
in
the
conclusion
of
his
brief,
the
respondent
indicates
that
indeed
the
inquiry
that
this
court
should
make
is
whether
or
not
under
the
totality
of
circumstances,
whether
respondent
mosley
under
all
of
the
circumstances
knowing
and
voluntarily
and
intelligently
waived
his
rights.
now,
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
arguing
to
this
court.
now,
we
do
not
feel
that
we
are
contending
for
a
new
rule
here
in
this
court.
it
is
our
position
that
has
always
been
the
rule
since
miranda.
that
in
fact,
any
new
rule
here
is
the
rule
that
has
been
promulgated
by
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
we
submit
that
that
rule
ought
not
to
stand
in
this
particular
case
nor
in
any
other
case
arising
under
these
same
facts.
now,
it
cannot
be
disputed
here
that
mr.
mosley
was
twice
given
his
rights,
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
in
their
opinion
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
disputed
on
this
record.
there
were
as
i
mentioned
two
clean
waivers
of
rights.
there
was
not
coercion
in
this
case.
there
were
no
threats
made
to
the
defendant
in
order
to
get
him
to
waive.
there
was
no
attempt
in
this
case
to
subvert
his
previous
exercise
of
the
right
to
remain
silent.
there
was
no
long
incarceration
here.
this
case
was
a
new
investigation
being
handled
by
a
separate
bureau,
in
charge
of
by
a
separate
police
officer,
sergeant
hill,
and
in
fact,
the
interrogation
initially
i
point
out,
was
only
twenty
minutes
in
length,
only
covered
a
few
preliminary
questions.
now,
the
many
courts
that
have
considered
this
question,
both
state
and
federal
courts,
have
adapted
the
rule
that
we
are
contending
for
in
this
case.
that
is
to
say
that
as
long
as
any
subsequent
inquiry
respects
the
rights
preciously
asserted
in
the
subsequent
inquiries
undertaken
for
good
faith
reasons,
there
is
no
reason
or
whatever
to
hold
the
fact
that
the
man
exercised
his
right
previously
should
taint
any
subsequent
voluntarily
waiver
of
rights.
that
is
what
we
are
saying
in
this
particular
case,
that
the
rights
were
knowingly
waived
previously
than
they
were
exercised
relative
to
robberies.
in
the
second
case,
there
was
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
here
and
the
confession
was
voluntarily
made.
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
badgering
here.
there
was
no
harassing
as
mr.
justice
marshall
has
inclined
to
believe.
there
was
no
institutionalized
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
my
apologies,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
but
there
was
in
any
event
no
bureaucratic
harassment
in
this
case.
there
was
not
systematic
attempt
to
break
down
the
exercise
of
his
right
previously
exercised.
in
fact,
as
i
indicated,
mr.
hill
did
not
know
of
that
previous
exercise.
i
think
that
goes
to
the
good
faith
of
his
activities
in
this
case.
now,
we
feel
in
this
case
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
erred
by
adapting
the
per
se
rule
and
holding
the
confession
should
have
been
suppressed.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
on
the
circumstances
in
this
case
to
hold
the
confession
to
have
been
voluntarily
and
intelligently
entered
into
and
tendered
into
evidence.
now
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
no,
your
honor.
everything
that
would
be
available
to
a
michigan
court
is
available
to
this
court.
what
i
think
i
suggested,
your
honor
or
attempted
to
suggest,
was
that
defense
counsel
in
this
case
agreed
with
us
that
totality
of
circumstances
should
have
been
the
test
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
should
be
the
test
here,
although
his
conclusions
are
somewhat
different
from
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
well,
your
honor,
i
know
that
this
court
in
brown
versus
illinois,
decided
last
term,
decided
the
issue
rather
than
submit
it
back
to
the
trial
court,
that
this
court
will
have
before
all
of
the
facts
that
will
be
available
to
the
michigan
court.
and
i
think
that
given
this
case
your
honor,
it
would
be
importance
of
this
case
and
the
importance
of
this
issue
to
all
of
the
state
and
federal
courts,
not
only
the
michigan
court,
that
this
court
ought
to
instruct
lower
courts
on
what
the
feeling
is
of
this
court
in
this
area
and
i
think
that,
especially
the
michigan
court
in
this
case
needs
some
instruction
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
enough
facts
are
present
here
that
this
court
could
determine
whether
or
not
the
arrest
was
valid,
if
it
so
desired.
however,
the
fact
remains
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
only
addressed
one
issue
in
this
case
and
that
was
the
miranda
issue.
it
is
our
position
that
impliedly
that
meant
that
the
arrest
was
lawful
here.
what
we
would
ask
this
court
to
do,
would
be
to
reverse
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
relative
to
the
confession
and
send
it
back
to
the
michigan
court
for
proceedings
not
in
consistent
with
that
opinion.
i
think
under
that
particular
remand,
the
defendant
would
be
allowed
to
raise
any
other
grounds
that
he
might
feel
he
was
entitled
to.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
we
would
be
content,
your
honor,
with
the
reversal
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and
with
some
instructive
language
relative
to
the
confession
in
what
miranda
intended
in
cases
such
as
this
one.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
a
walker
hearing,
your
honor,
is
the
counterpart
of
the
jackson
v.
deno
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
the
walker
hearing
is
a
jackson
v.
deno
hearing
to
determine
the
admissibility
and
voluntariness
of
a
confession.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
it
is
people
versus
walker.
it
is
a
michigan
case,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
now,
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
miranda
did
not
preclude
subsequent
interrogation
relative
to
even
the
same
case
that
instead
as
i
indicated
the
circumstances
of
the
waiver
and
the
confession
have
to
be
looked
to
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
but
in
any
event,
this
case
is
not
a
case
of
continuing
or
incessant
interrogation.
this
case,
indeed
is
a
case,
wherein
the
interrogations,
one
by
cowie
and
one
by
hill,
involved
separate,
unrelated,
distinct
crimes
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
was
specifically
allowed
for
in
the
companion
case,
the
miranda,
westover
versus
united
states.
now,
this
was
a
different
crime.
there
was
a
different
interrogator
and
may
i
say
i
feel
that
it
was
a
different
place,
the
interrogation
taking
place
in
the
fifth-floor
rather
than
the
fourth
and
those
circumstances
more
importantly
appearing
to
the
defendant
because
he
testified
that
he
understood
that
the
second
inquiry
was
a
homicide
inquiry
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
would
be
merely
a
form
over
substance
rule
that
would
require
that
the
second
authority
come
from
the
federal
jurisdiction
as
opposed
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
not
at
all,
your
honor,
i
think
the
critical
question
is
to
look
at
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
in
a
particular
case
and
i
think
that
is
what
this
court
did
in
westover
because
in
westover,
even
westover
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
you
argued
that
case
as
i
remember.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
but
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
ipso
facto
that
should
not
determine
what
the
outcome
in
a
given
case
is.
i
say
that
it
is
a
merely
a
formal
distinction
as
to
whether
one
authority
is
a
federal
authority
or
a
state
authority.
i
can
visualize
certain
cases
arising,
for
example
in
our
jurisdiction,
wherein
one
police
agency
may
come
into
a
case,
wherein
say
the
detroit
police
department
is
holding
a
particular
suspect
and
to
say
that
simply
because
they
may
be
from
the
same
agency
that
per
se
precludes
any
interrogation.
i
submit
that
westover
does
not
go
that
far.
i
think
that
in
westover,
this
court
recognized
that
the
questioning
there
which
went
over
fourteen
hours
and
was
without
miranda
rights,
could
result
in
a
voluntary
confession
to
the
fbi,
who
was
the
second
interrogating
authority
as
long
as
miranda
rights
were
given
and
as
long
as
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
given
an
opportunity
to
exercise
those
rights.
now,
if
that
is
the
case,
i
submit
that
in
this
case
wherein
we
have
only
a
short
20-minute
interrogation
wherein
the
defendant’s
rights
were
honored,
in
fact,
they
saw
that
they
worked,
he
exercised
the
right
to
remain
silent
relative
to
the
robberies,
questioning
ceased.
that
in
this
case,
with
that
short
interrogation,
a
respect
of
rights,
a
valid
giving
of
miranda
warnings,
that
should
not
taint
per
se
the
subsequent
confession
in
this
case,
given
to
detective
hill.
that
is
our
position
as
far
as
westover
goes
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
it
supports
the
position
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
yes,
your
honor,
the
city
government.
the
detroit
police
department
prescribes
procedures
to
be
followed
by
its
officers
in
a
given
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
no,
in
the
city
there
are
state
statutes,
your
honor,
that
guide
the
city
police
in
certain
areas.
for
example,
in
the
area
of
arrest
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
a
direct
hand
in
it,
your
honor.
we
have
the
detroit
police
department.
we
have
the
wayne
county
sheriff’s
department
and
we
have
the
michigan
state
police.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
the
wayne
county
prosecutor’s
office.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
yes,
he
does,
your
honor.
the
state
attorney
general,
are
you
speaking
about
this
particular
case
coming
into
this
case?
the
attorney
general
has
the
authority
in
the
state
of
michigan
to
enter
any
case
as
the
attorney
of
record
on
behalf
of
the
people.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
he
may
displace
us,
if
he
so
chose
to
do
so,
but
in
this
particular
case
he
did
not
do
that.
now,
as
indicated,
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
confession
was
voluntarily
made
and
knowingly
and
intelligently
made,
we
would
ask
this
court
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
reverse
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
on
the
confession
issue
and
hold
that
indeed
miranda
versus
arizona
did
not
preclude
any
subsequent
interrogation
for
good
faith
purposes.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
i
think
from
the
examples
that
had
been
given
in
this
particular
case,
some
of
the
answers
that
had
been
given
by
the
respondent
to
them,
indicating
that
some
of
the
answers
are
very
difficult,
i
think
that
the
court
can
see
what
a
pandora’s
box
would
be
introduced
in
this
case,
should
the
per
se
rule
stand.
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
on
that
basis
why
so
many
states
and
so
many
federal
jurisdictions
in
this
country
have
rejected
that
rule.
it
is
not
a
workable
rule.
that
the
more
workable
rule
is
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
and
many
of
the
examples
given
by
counsel
for
the
respondent
are
examples
of
bad
faith
of
the
police.
for
example,
a
failure
to
take
no
for
an
answer
and
coming
back
ten
times
to
a
particular
defendant
to
get
him
to
waive
his
rights
under
the
constitution,
i
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
due
process
clause
will
take
care
of
those
situations.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
have
no
objection
with
what
the
michigan
court
does
based
on
the
michigan
constitution,
but
we
are
here
today
because
the
michigan
court
took
it
upon
itself
to
interpret
the
federal
constitution
more
strictly
than
this
court
itself
has
ever
interpreted
that
document.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
i
think
there
could
be
your
honor.
i
think
that
a
certain
behavior
by
the
police
department,
for
example,
overreaching,
overbearing
incessant
questioning,
badgering
of
a
defendant
and
obtaining
a
waiver
of
rights
might
result
in
a
violation
of
miranda.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
cases
are
legion
and
we
have
them
i
believe
all
cited
--
mr.
thomas
m.
khalil
that
is
correct.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
approach
by
the
police
telling
mr.
mosley,
your
rob
partners
has
confessed,
come
on
and
waive
your
rights.
in
this
particular
case,
no
questioning
whatever
was
undertaken
by
the
detective
hill,
until
a
waiver
of
rights
was
obtained,
and
thereafter,
mr.
mosley
was
confronted
with
his
confession
and
i
think
in
the
words
of
mr.
mosley,
the
reason
he
confessed
in
this
case
was
because
he
got
scared
because
of
that
involvement
put
on
him
by
mr.
smith.
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
the
issue
of
the
arrest
has
been
raised
in
this
particular
case.
it
has
been
our
position
all
through
these
proceedings
that
the
arrest
was
valid.
there
are
additional
factors
which
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
not
pointed
out
to
the
court.
i
will
not
take
up
the
court’s
time
with
those
factors
necessarily
except
to
say
that
the
information
that
detective
hill
got
from
anthony
smith,
at
that
particular
point
in
time
probable
cause
existed
to
arrest
mr.
mosley
for
the
murder
of
leroy
williams
and
i
think
that
this
court
under
the
analysis
undertaken
in
brown
versus
illinois,
could
very
well
find
that
indeed
the
confession
was
not
violative
of
miranda.
it
was
not
the
result
of
any
illegal
arrest,
even
assuming
that
the
arrest
were
unlawful
in
the
first
instance,
any
taint
would
have
sufficiently
attenuated
and
would
have
made
the
confession
proper
in
this
case.
i
just
like
to
say
that
in
this
particular
matter,
i
do
not
think
that
there
could
ever
be
a
case
presented
to
this
court
in
which
the
waivers
that
around
this
record,
the
waivers
that
had
been
introduced
in
court
and
the
conduct
of
these
officers
that
are
on
the
record
here
could
be
anymore
admirable
than
is
here.
the
waivers
are
crystal
clear,
razor
clean.
the
behavior
of
detective
hill,
i
think
is
without
question,
that
of
an
officer
showing
respect
for
miranda.
the
question
came
from
the
bench
earlier
as
why
the
rights
were
given
twice.
i
think
that
the
reason
could
be.
if
we
hearken
back
to
miranda
itself,
i
think
that
miranda
in
this
case
has
taught
the
police
officers
to
give
the
rights.
those
rights
were
fully
complied
with
here
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
