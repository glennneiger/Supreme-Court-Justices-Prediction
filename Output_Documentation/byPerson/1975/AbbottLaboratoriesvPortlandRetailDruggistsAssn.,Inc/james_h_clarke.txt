mr.
james
h.
clarke
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
case
is
before
you
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
reversed
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
petitioners,
which
had
been
entered
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
district
court.
the
action
is
one
for
trouble
damages
and
injunctive
relief
for
price
discrimination
brought
by
an
association,
a
retail
druggist,
against
drug
manufacturers.
one
of
the
classes
of
allegedly
unlawful
discriminatory
sales
are
to
non-profit
hospitals.
the
petitioners
pleaded,
as
a
defense,
the
nonprofit
institution
act,
which
exempts
from
the
robinson-patman
act,
all
purchases
of
supplies
for
their
own
use
by
non-profit
hospitals
and
certain
other
non-profit
institutions.
it
was
the
respondents’
theory
which
has
never
changed
and
has
been
stated
in
this
court
that
the
exemption
is
limited
as
a
matter
law
to
purchases
of
drugs
that
are
physically
consumed
on
hospital
premises,
and
therefore
cannot
be
competitively
supplied
by
retailers.
the
district
court
disagreed.
it
held
it
all
drug
users
engaged
in
by
the
non-profit
hospitals
as
shown
by
the
record
where
the
own
use
of
the
hospital
and
granted
summary
judgment.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
as
to
the
non-profit
status
of
the
thirteen
general
service
hospitals
whose
affairs
are
before
you
today,
but
limited
the
exemption
to
inpatient
and
emergency
room
use.
it
agreed
that
all
of
the
rejected
drug
uses
by
the
non-profit
hospitals
serve
the
public
and
are
proper
hospital
functions,
that
it
held
that
in
those
cases
the
hospital
was
not
the
consumer
and
these
drugs
were
purchased
for
its
purchasers
use
instead
of
its
own.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
this
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
sale
your
honor.
there
is
no
contention
by
the
petitioners
on
one
hand
that
a
hospital
can
setup
a
retail
drugstore
and
stock
it
with
13c
(ph)
merchandise.
on
the
other
hand,
when
a
customer
comes
in
who,
as
a
matter
of
need,
emergency,
or
for
some
other
reason,
finds
it
inconvenient
or
retail
drugstore
is
unavailable,
we
say
that
the
hospital
is
performing
a
hospital
function,
even
though
in
those
cases
there
is
no
associated
hospital
service
of
a
distinct
kind.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
the
refilling
of
take
home
prescriptions
is
one
of
the
three
of
the
so-called
minor
categories
of
business
that
are
involved
in
this
lawsuit.
in
that
case,
it
could
still
be
a
matter
of
convenience
or
a
matter
of
extending
hospital
services
or
hospital
has
the
pharmacy
prescription
and
as
a
matter
of
convenience
they
will
on
occasion
come
back.
most
of
the
hospitals
according
to
this
record
do
not
fill
or
refill
take
home
prescriptions.
there
are
three
or
four
that
will
do
it.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
believe
so
sir.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
well
that
is
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
you
can.
there
is
an
additional
analysis
which
we
think
supports
our
position
in
this
area.
we
think
that
when
a
hospital
--
when
a
sick
person
gets
a
hospital
drug
and
uses
it,
consumes
it,
which
is
all
the
drugs
happen
to
do.
he
is
obviously
using
the
drug.
that
is
what
the
drug
is
for,
it
is
been
prescribed
for
him
to
make
him
well,
he
is
using
it.
it
is
our
position
that
when
the
hospital
dispenses
the
drug
to
him
as
part
of
its
institutional
functions,
it
is
also
using
the
drug
because
that
is
all
hospital
use
drugs
for.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
they
dispense
drug;
they
charge
for
them
and
they
make
net
profits.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
they
make
net
profits.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
right.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
never
been
the
position
of
the
petitioners.
our
position
has
been
that
the
dispensing
has
to
be
associated
or
should
be
associated,
in
some
way,
with
the
hospital
functions.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
no,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
would
not
disagree
with
that
and
if
this
were
an
appropriate
thing
for
hospitals
to
do
at
any
given
point
in
time.
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
a
very
possible
conclusion.
now
as
the
court
is
aware
the
record
shows
that
each
hospital
has
a
pharmacy.
it
is
an
integrated
department
of
the
hospital.
it
achieves
net
revenues
and
those
net
revenues
are
devoted
to
institutional
purposes
namely
the
financing
of
non-revenue
producing
departments.
the
principle
drug
use
is
for
dispensing
to
in-patients.
the
record
shows
that
some
90%
or
more
of
all
of
these
hospital
drug
purchases
are
used
that
way
and
the
dispute
is
over
the
remaining
10%.
the
bulk
of
this
10%
is
used
in
three
established
distributional
practices.
the
first
is
the
take
home
drugs
that
we
referred
to
before.
these
are
drugs
that
are
prescribed
by
the
doctor
in
amounts
that
are
determined
by
the
doctor
and
they
are
regarded
as
a
continuation
of
the
hospitals
medication.
probably
the
most
hotly
debated
area
before
this
court
is
a
net
of
outpatient
care.
outpatients
fall
into
two
classes
according
to
this
record.
there
are
the
traditional
outpatient
clinics
of
which
there
are
half
a
dozen
important
associated
with
the
hospitals
as
a
hospital
function
which
cater
primarily
to
the
poor.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
these
are,
i
believe
that
a
manual
hospital
has
a
sort
of
a
campus
type
arrangement,
so
it
would
not
necessarily
be
in
the
same
building.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
the
clinics
that
i
am
now
referring
to
are
not.
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
in
the
lower
courts
had
to
do
with
the
kaiser
medical
care
–
best
kaiser
hospital,
which
the
hospital
for
an
hmo.
they
had
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
correct
sir,
but
they
have
separated
clinics.
the
importance
of
outpatient
care
is
not
however
limited
to
the
clinics
that
conventionally
have
served
the
poor.
as
i
think
is
apparent
from
the
american
hospital
association
brief,
which
i
will
not
repeat,
this
is
a
rapidly
expanding
area
of
hospital
service.
it
is
one
which
promotes
the
public
interest
by
reducing
hospital
cost
and
reducing
the
incidents
of
inpatient
care
by
emphasizing
the
incidents
of
outpatient
care.
then
the
third
primary
category
that
was
excluded
is
staff
sales,
the
pharmacy
privilege
which
is
accorded
by
the
hospitals
to
those
who
work
for
them
and
those
who
practice
medicine
in
association
with
them.
this
is
regarded
by
the
institutions
as
a
benefit
to
the
institution
something
that
promotes
its
operations,
it
is
an
important
employee
fringe
benefit,
it
is
negotiated
for
in
some
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
the
institutions
have
and
it
is
a
subject
of
the
fliers
and
publicity
that
they
give
their
employees
when
they
come
to
work.
the
only
difference
--
excuse
me.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
the
question
is
not
your
honor,
whether
the
hospitals
should
be
selling
these
drugs
in
these
ways.
the
question
is
whether
they
are
performing
appropriate
hospital
function
when
they
do.
in
the
case
of
the
pharmacy
privilege,
the
record
shows
we
believe
that
this
is
an
integral
part
of
the
association
of
people
and
resources
and
materials
which
this
hospitals
--
which
constitutes
this
hospital,
that
aids
its
operation.
and
it
is
our
theory
that
the
exemption
extends
to
all
drug
uses
that
aid
or
promote
the
operations
of
a
hospital
and
that
this
is
the
scope
of
this
statutory
exemption.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
think
that
so
far
as
his
patients
who
are
hospitalized
there
is
no
problem
as
there
is
in
any
other
case.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
but
if
the
question
is
whether
the
surgeon
should
be
allowed
to
supply
his
office
patients
with
drugs
purchased
from
the
hospital
pharmacy,
which
i
--
if
i
am
correctly
construing
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
this
is
again,
one
of
the
minor
categories.
the
record
shows
that
some,
not
all,
but
some
of
the
hospitals
will
sell
drugs
to
a
doctor
for
his
office
use,
usually
injectables
or
specialty
items
which
are
not
available
in
the
general
retail
market.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
not
if
the
hospital
does
not
sell
the
walk-in
patients.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
if
does,
well
then
he
would
be
like
any
other
walk-in
patient.
now
with
respect
to
walk-in
patients
the
record
is
very
clear
that
there
are
only
two
of
these
hospitals
that
make
any
walk-in
sales
on
a
non-discourage
basis.
there
are
two
hospitals
which
are
located
in
areas
of
particular
need.
one
is
next
to
a
retirement
home
and
the
other
is
in
an
area
of
elderly
and
poor
people,
and
the
administrators
of
those
hospitals
said
that
they
will
fill
walk-in
business
for
those
two
categories
in
those
two
cases.
other
than
that
the
record
we
think
is
quite
clear
that
the
hospitals
do
not
want
walk-in
business,
they
do
not
regard
themselves
as
being
in
that
business,
and
the
incidence
of
walk-in
sales
is
negligible
far
less
than
1%
of
total
sales.
we
think
that
the
court
should
consider
in
this
case,
in
light
of
the
statutory
language,
which
is
unlimited,
it
does
not
seek
to
define
or
limit
the
phrase
use.
the
hospitals
are
institutions
for
the
treatment
of
the
sick
and
the
injured.
this
is
why
they
exist.
and
we
say
that
it
is
the
institutional
use
of
their
drugs
when
they
are
dispensed
for
the
use
of
the
sick
and
the
injured.
it
is
a
functional
term.
the
importance
of
drug
therapy
is
also
developed
in
the
briefs.
one
of
the
keys
to
the
expansion
of
outpatient
services,
which
reduces
the
exorbitant
cost
of
inpatient
services
has
been
drug
therapy,
which
is
received
by
hospital
outpatients.
all
of
these
outpatients
are
registered
hospital
patients
and
they
are
all
receiving
hospital
services.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
agree.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
all.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
my
powers
of
imagination
or
inventiveness
are
perhaps
limited
and
there
might
be
other
categories
that
could
be
suggested.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
beside
the
general
retail
store,
but
that
is
the
obvious
limitation.
i
do
think
that
the
court
can
approach
it
from
the
other
end
and
say
that
everything
is
hospital
use
which
assists,
or
aids,
or
is
associated
with
its
institutional
operations.
now,
that
is
a
broad
definition.
it
is
where
we
begin.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
the
difference,
as
i
see,
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
straight
commercial
retail
operation
of
a
kind
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to.
there
is
no
association
of
hospital
activities
as
such
with
the
sale
and
that
is
a
possible
ground
of
distinction.
but
i
think,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there
are
categories
of
drug
use
in
this
case,
which
are
not
associated
with
the
actual
performance
of
other
hospital
services.
i
am
thinking
particularly
of
supplying
injectables
to
doctor’s
offices
and
supplying
walk-ins
that
come
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
need
drugs.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
do
not
exclude
those.
i
say
that
under
those
circumstances
the
sale
of
the
drug
is
itself
a
hospital
use
because
it
relates
directly
to
the
hospital
function
as
a
community
medical
resource.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
would
say
well
--
i
am
not
anxious
to
build
fences
around
this
exemption
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
have
excluded
that
from
the
exemption
because
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
which
i
have
tried
to
explain.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
well
that
isolated
kind
of
sale
would
have
no
connection.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
correct
and
the
record
shows
that
the
policies
of
the
hospitals
are
to
discourage
walk-in
business.
the
record
shows
that
the
volume
of
this
walk-in
business
is
negligible.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
no
sir
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
record
shows
that
the
walk-in
business
which
does
occur
is
associated
with
the
hospital
function,
that
is
usually
in
cases
of
special
need.
therefore,
there
is
an
association
with
the
hospital’s
community
responsibility
and
therefore
there
is
a
sufficient
nexus
with
the
hospital
operation
to
justify
it.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
think
it
would
not
--
excuse
me.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
no
sir.
i
am
afraid
i
did
not
follow
your
question.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
no,
it
is
in
the
emergency
room
which
is
a
special
service.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
--
the
emergency
room
usually
have
their
own
little
supply
of
drugs
which
they
dispense
to
somebody
who
is
brought
in
and
after
an
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
am
talking
about
--
let
us
take
the
example
of
emmanuel
hospital,
which
is
located
in
the
black
district
to
portland.
drugstore
is
closed
early
in
the
day,
it
is
a
rough
neighborhood
and
somebody
has
to
get
a
prescription
filled,
so
they
come
to
the
hospital
pharmacy,
and
yes,
emmanuel
will
sell
that
walk-in
customer
and
they
do
not
know
whether
she
is
a
patient
of
the
staff
of
not.
that
is
correct.
the
other
way
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
we,
our
position
does
not
go
that
far.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
obviously,
it
would
do
so
if
the
court
put
an
offense
all
around
it.
it
is
our
position
that
the
walk-in
customer
can
properly
be
served
in
these
cases
of
emergency
or
need.
it
is
also
our
position
that
there
has
to
be
a
certain
flexibility
in
this
statute.
the
pharmacist,
when
the
person
comes
in,
has
to
be
able
to
exercise
some
kind
of
judgment.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
whether
that
would
cover
the
range
of
circumstances
in
which
those
sales
would
occur
i
cannot
speculate.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
it
would
be
an
artificial
kind
of
a
limitation.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
this
is
the
point,
this
statute
represents
a
congressional
decision
that
was
in
the
area
of
the
statute.
this
will
happen.
this
statute
does
not
say
one
word
about
limiting
the
use
of
supplies
in
non-competitive
ways,
which
is
the
net
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
the
effective
apha’s
brief
and
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
it
is
our
position
that
there
must
be
a
nexus
between
the
dispensing
of
the
drug
and
the
operation
of
the
hospital.
and
if
there
is
that
nexus
it
does
not
matter
what
the
circumstances
or
what
kind
of
dispensing
is
involved.
this
is
the
fence
you
build
around.
it
must
be
related
in
some
way
to
the
hospital’s
operations,
it
must
assist
the
hospital’s
function
in
treating
the
sick
and
the
injured,
but
that
within
that
admittedly
broad
category.
there
are
going
to
be
many
kinds
of
drug
dispensing
and
the
statute
contemplates,
because
it
is
an
exemption
statute
that
from
time
to
time
there
will
be
an
impingement
on
somebody
else’s
business.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
would
say
if
they
were
at
the
hospital
for
diagnosis
and
they
are
under
the
care
of
the
hospital,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
do
not
think
that
at
this
stage
of
hospital
development
that
it
necessarily
is,
no.
i
do
think
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
think
that
it
has
to
include
not
exclude,
the
exemption
has
to
include
the
casual
walk-in
customer
who
is
there
for
whom
the
hospital
is
providing
a
resource
that
the
customer
needs.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
mr.
justice,
we
do
not
say
that
the
hospitals
have
an
unlimited
discretion
to
define
their
own
functions.
these
functions
are
changing.
they
are
changed
by
the
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
the
hospital’s
discretion?
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
think
that
there
is
an
area
within
which
you
can
say
that
certain
kinds
of
activities
are
appropriate
and
certain
kinds
are
not.
at
this
point
i
would
not
say
that
opening
a
retail
drug
stores
a
proper
function
of
a
non-profit
hospital
but
20
years
from
now
it
might
be.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
if
these
were
appropriate
and
proper
hospital
functions,
yes
sir,
they
would
be.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
they
will
--
that
is
correct
sir.
i
will
reserve
--
excuse
me.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
about
one
third
of
one
percent.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
the
general
pattern
mr.
justice
powell
is
that
the
outpatient
services
are
performed
at
the
central
institution,
however,
around
the
country
the
system
of
satellite
clinics
is
developing
an
important
one
that
has
developed
was
the
kaiser
organization
which
of
course
is
not
before
us.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
could
--
they
either
are
or
they
are
being
projected.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
my
understanding
sir.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
means
that
if
they
are
registered
on
the
books
of
the
hospital
as
hospital
patients
just
as
of
an
inpatient
is
registered
when
he
comes
in.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
i
believe
not.
the
way
this
is
done
at
emanuel
which
is
the
outstanding
example
in
portland,
because
it
is
so
much
larger
and
more
comprehensive
than
the
other,
is
that
at
least
at
the
traditional
outpatient
clinics
they
gave
the
patient
a
card
and
he
shows
that
card
to
the
pharmacy
when
he
comes
in.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
correct.
and
the
employee
will
have
a
card
that
identifies
him.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
in
that
particular
case.
now
i
do
not
know
how
this
is
handled
in
the
other
institutions.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
it
does
not
show
a
percentage.
there
are
only
three
or
four
of
the
hospitals
which
will
refill
take
home
prescriptions
and
i
believe
that
one
of
them
--
in
one
or
two
of
them
that
they
did
estimate
the
volume
of
it
and
the
volume
was
quite
low
as
i
recall
it,
25
or
30
a
week
or
20
a
week
or
something
of
that
kind
in
one
of
the
larger
ones,
but
there
is
no
hard
information
about
the
actual
volume
of
refill
business.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
patient
does
any
distance
from
the
hospital
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
go
to
a
retail
or
drugstore
anyway.
this
would
happen
only
in
these
--
tend
to
happen
only
in
these
cases
where
the
hospital
pharmacy
is
convenient.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
james
h.
clarke
no
sir,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
lists
are
identical.
if
they
are
not,
the
printer’s
error
--
mr.
james
h.
clarke
no
sir.
