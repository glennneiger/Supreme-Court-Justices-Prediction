we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
abbott
laboratories
against
portland
retail
druggist.
mr.
clarke
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
laying
aside
all
of
the
others
categories
that
are
involved,
when
a
hospital
sells
to
a
customer
who
walks
in
off
the
street,
are
they
forming
a
hospital
function
or
a
drugstore
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
eight
circuit
opinion
were
narrowed
to
survive
that
emergency
situation
were
accepted
from
their
ban,
would
that
satisfy
your
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
as
you
said
that
the
hospitals
try
to
discourage
the
1%,
apparently
you
use
that
figure,
the
1%
of
those
who
come
in
off
the
street
to
buy.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
has
rather
firmly
discouraged
that
kind
of
business.
if
that
were
not
so,
we
were
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
item
with
that
not
put
a
premium
on
every
hospital
in
effect
to
open
on
pharmacy,
right
within
their
own
establishment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
asking
you
about
a
tendency.
you
cannot
control
all
the
hospitals,
no
one
can.
but
if
there
were
no
limitation
on
hospitals
right
to
sell
to
walk-in
customers,
the
same
kind
of
customers
who
come
in
to
a
drugstore,
the
traditional
drugstore,
would
that
not
encourage
hospitals
to
expand
their
pharmacy
operations
and
actually
seek
walk-in
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
if
defense
were
that
the
hospital
pharmacy
could
not
sell
the
walk-in
patients
before
9
in
the
morning
or
after
9
o’clock
at
night.
another
is
that
they
--
i
guess
i
have
it
reversed
--
that
they
could
not
sell
to
walk-in
customers
from
9
a.m.
to
9
p.m.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
an
artificial
when
that
is
approximately
the
business
hours
of
the
ordinary
pharmacy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
about
the
language
that
justice
stewart
read
to
you,
for
their
own
use
unless
you
give
this
expansive
reading
to
the
term
“their
use.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
mean
that
they
could
always
sell
aspirin
and
bufferin
to
anyone
who
had
a
pain.
then
would
you
say
that
that
is
the
function
of
the
hospital
embraced
in
the
language
“for
their
own
use”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
talking
about
walk-in
patients.
that
is
the
subject,
the
frame.
are
you
saying
that
under
this
language
it
is
a
hospital
function
to
sell
an
aspirin
or
similar
materials
to
any
person
who
has
a
pain
who
walks
in
off
the
street.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
you
should
have
no
objection
to
a
court
construing
that
language
has
not
including
the
casual
walk-in
customer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tilbury,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
quarrel
with
the
hospital
filling
a
prescription
or
refilling
or
selling
a
non-prescription
item
after
normal
business
hours
to
meet
an
emergency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
our
business
or
even
the
court
of
appeals
to
undertake
to
prescribed
forms
and
mechanisms
but
from
your
close
association
as
both
of
you
gentlemen
have
had
with
this
case.
would
it
be
difficult
in
your
view
to
set
up
a
procedure
and
a
mechanism
to
take
care
of
some
kind
of
a
certification
as
to
particular
after
our
sales
for
an
emergency
that
would
define
what
the
emergency
law
is.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
a
different
term.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
talking
about
within
the
framework
that
we
have
here.
you,
i
take
it,
then
would
not
object
to
walk-in
service,
walk-in
customers
or
emergencies
after
normal
business
hours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
was
asking
a
question
on
the
framework
of
our
entire
dialogue
here.
i
ask,
in
fact,
i
purposed
the
question,
do
you
think
that
is
a
proper
hospital
function?
i
repeat
it.
is
it
a
proper
hospital
function
in
this
framework?
the
only
reason
that
we
are
all
here
is
if
sales
are
made
to
walk-in
customers
after
regular
business
hours
and
for
some
declared
emergency
situation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap).
is
it,
for
their
own
use,
to
sell
after
regular
business
hours
to
meet
an
emergency
for
outpatient?
is
it
“for
there
own
use”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
that
not
overlook
the
modern
trend,
when
i
say
modern
it
is
pertaining
30
or
40
years
ago
to
keep
people
out
of
hospital
if
they
can
and
be
--
to
get
them
out
of
the
hospital
as
quickly
as
possible
after
surgery
or
other
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
just
are
not
enough
hospital,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
result
there,
after
the
delivery
of
the
baby
they
are
having
the
mother
and
child
go
home
sometimes
in
24
hours,
after
surgery
that
is
formerly
was
two
or
three
weeks.
they
now
send
them
home
in
two
or
three
days
or
even
less.
now
are
you
going
to
cut
the
hospitals
or
are
you
going
to
have
the
trend
that
is
going
to
lengthen
in
the
hospital
stay
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
comes
under
two.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
this
in
a
practical,
so
that
it
makes
a
better
question.
30
years
ago
or
more,
an
appendectomy
or
herniotomy
meant
two
weeks
at
least
in
the
hospital.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
he
using
it,
if
they
give
it
to
him
before
he
leaves?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
before
he
leaves
for
consumption
at
home,
for
consumption
whenever
he
needs
it,
under
instructions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
want
them
to
perform
your
client’s
function,
that
is
the
essence
of
it,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
the
cases
is
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
correctly
translate
your
obligation
means
that
this
court
should
not
reverse
the
court
of

on
this
record,
that
we
might
affirm
them
on
this

not
