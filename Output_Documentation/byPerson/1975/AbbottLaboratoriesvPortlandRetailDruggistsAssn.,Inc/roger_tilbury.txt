mr.
roger
tilbury
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
i
would
like
to
answer
judge
powell’s
question
that
he
just
presented
as
to
the
ratio
of
refills.
there
is
any
record
evidence
that
in
so
far
as
kaiser
is
concerned
the
ratio
was
approximately
40%.
now
the
other
hospitals
do
not
assign
a
new
number
to
a
refill
and
for
this
reason
it
is
difficult
to
know
and
there
records
are
incomplete
they
sometimes
will
assign
a
letter
after
the
number,
but
we
think
it
is
substantially
larger
than
the
defendants
so
far
have
conceded.
mr.
roger
tilbury
in
a
way
your
honor
that
is
true.
however,
the
other
hospitals
are
patterning
themselves
to
a
degree
after
kaiser
and
we
can
see
that
if
this
court
should
sustained
the
position
that
mr.
clarke
wishes
that
they
are
soon
going
to
embark
upon
the
same
type
of
program.
it
is
true
as
you
point
up
that
the
night
circuit
did
send
that
back
for
a
reexamination
insofar
as
kaiser,
but
the
matter
of
developing
this
clinics
which
are
considerably
removed
incidentally
in
the
case
of
kaiser,
some
of
them
are
up
to
10
and
12
miles
away
from
the
hospital,
will
be
the
way
in
which
they
are
definitely
trending
the
goal.
mr.
roger
tilbury
well
i
would
certainly
agree,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor
since
you
have
mentioned
that
point,
i
would
like
to
say
that
much
of
what
mr.
clarke
has
said
seems
to
us
to
be
irrelevant
for
the
very
reason
that
the
issues
that
he
assigned
in
his
true
briefs,
this
petition
and
all
the
way
through
his
primary
brief,
do
not
deal
with
the
category
of
walk-in,
say,
do
not
deal
with
refills,
and
they
do
not
deal
with
the
category
of
office
use
by
doctors.
the
only
three
things
that
he
has
assigned,
as
you
recall,
deal
specifically
with
the
employee
and
the
staff
position
sales
and
with
the
take
home
sales
to
a
patient
on
his
way
out
and
to
the
matter
of
outpatients.
these
are
the
only
things
that
seems
to
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
i
am
not
so
sure;
i
can
not
tell
for
certain
exactly
what
he
has
said.
he
has
mentioned
the
factor
of
outpatients
and
he
is
--
but
i
am
not
entirely
sure
as
to
what
position
he
is
taking
about.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
tilbury
he
would
be
billed
at
the
hospital.
some
of
the
doctors,
however,
i
think
almost
all
of
the
doctors
at
kaiser
clinic
in
portland
practice
only
at
the
clinic,
and
it
is
only
in
a
rare
situation
that
they
would
refer
anyone
to
the
primary
hospitals.
they
operate
truly
in
the
case
of
kaiser
and
this
is
really
tending
to
be
true
in
other
cases
as
well
as
drugstores
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
a
few
blocks
of
many
of
them.
they
have
doctors
that
are
there
who
are
technically,
in
a
real
sense
of
the
word,
employees
of
the
kaiser
foundation
although
they
have
their
own
separate
corporation
called
permanente
services
i
might
add,
and
in
the
sense
that
their
connection
with
the
hospital
is
rather
tenuous
one
except
that
they
are
all
technically
under
the
kaiser
blanket.
mr.
roger
tilbury
not
at
all
your
honor.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
hospital.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no
at
all
your
honor.
we
have
never
objected
to
any
sales
by
the
hospitals
of
any
kinds.
as
a
matter
off
act
we
would
not
object,
i
do
not
think
we
can,
since
we
also
believe
in
free
enterprise,
if
they
wanted
to
conduct
the
retail
store.
they
can
conduct
any
type
of
operations
--
excuse
me.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir.
the
only
thing
we
are
saying
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
not
at
all
your
honor.
we
certainly
do
not
wanted
to
deprive
anyone
who
needs
medication
and
getting
a
medication.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no
sir.
there
is
a
distinction
and
i
hope
i
am
making
it.
mr.
roger
tilbury
i
am
sorry
if
i
am
not
making
it
clear
your
honor,
and
i
will
try
to
make
it
clear.
we
do
not
object
to
any
type
of
sale
that
the
hospital
wishes
to
make
but
we
do
say
that
the
congress
when
it
passed
13c
limited
the
exemption
to
their
supplies
for
their
own
use
and
in
the
case
mentioned
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
no
sir,
unless
that
patient
happened
to
be
a
hospitalized
patient
and
unless
he
uses
at
any
emergency
room
on
the
premises
in
other
words.
and
this
has
always
been
the
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
well
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
correct
that
it
should
be
limited
to
a
use
on
the
hospital
premises
by
a
patient
or
somebody
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir,
we
concede.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir,
we
think
it
is.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no
sir,
just
the
first
two
your
honor.
mr.
roger
tilbury
that
is
correct
for
the
reason
your
honor
--[laughter]
mr.
roger
tilbury
for
the
reason
that
it
is
not
used
on
the
premises,
it
is
not
use
under
the
hospital
supervision,
the
individuals
has
no
connection
with
the
hospital
once
he
leaves
the
hospital,
and
the
reports
indicated
despite
what
mr.
clarke
has
said
that
this
was
not
intended
to
encompass
the
whirl,
that
congress
did
intend
to
restrict
it
to
a
situation
where
it
was
intended
to
be
used
on
the
premises
and
for
that
particular
function.
mr.
roger
tilbury
we
will
all
agree
that
that
is
a
desire,
yes.
mr.
roger
tilbury
certainly
that
is
true.
and
i
do
not
think
they
are
not
enough
drugstores
either
your
honors
at
the
present
time.
mr.
roger
tilbury
in
a
way
they
may
--
as
i
again
repeat
your
honor.
we
do
not
object
anything
that
can
do
to
alleviate
the
plight
of
the
patient
whatever
that
maybe
and
if
they
wish
to
sell
in
any
way
emergency
times
or
whatever
that
is
fine.
but
we
think
the
congress
meant
what
is
said
when
the
exemption
was
not
at
unlimited
one.
if
they
had
meant
strictly
that
it
applies
to
all
non-profit
institutions
they
could
have
set
it
that
way,
but
they
did
not.
they
specifically
said
purchases
of
their
supplies
for
their
own
use.
now
as
you
well
know
the
words
are
construed
with
regards
to
their
normal
usage.
the
congress
is
not
presumed
to
use
superfluous
words.
those
words
have
a
meaning
and
the
word
“use”
has
always
meant
consumption
by
the
individual
using
it.
it
does
not
mean
a
resale.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
rather
strangely,
mr.
clarke
seems
to
be
a
cross
purposes
with
its
own
client
lilly,
because
for
mr.
debose
(ph)
for
example,
told
the
congress
during
the
extensive
hearing
which
agree
with
our
interpretation
by
congress
in
1967
and
68
extending
over
a
thousand
pages
that
that
was
what
it
meant.
it
meant
a
use
within
the
institution
itself
and
mr.
debose
(ph)
who
used
to
be
in
charge,
manager
of
the
portland
office
for
lilly
told
congress
that
in
general
i
think
we
can
say
that
the
furnishing
of
drugs
to
outpatients
or
to
patients
off
the
street
probably
results
in
a
competitive
inequity
to
the
retailer.
and
for
years
lilly
has
required
all
of
the
hospitals
that
buy
from
it
before
they
can
acquire
their
goods
at
a
preferential
price
to
sign
an
agreement
that
the
particular
institution
will
“use
the
products
only
for
its
own
use
within
the
institution
and
not
for
resale.”
now
at
some
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
well
i
would
again
say
since
it
defines
it
in
terms
of
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir,
i
would
interpret
lilly’s
agreement
to
mean
that
it
has
to
be
used
at
the
hospital.
if
it
is
used
as
the
hospital
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
alright,
then
i
would
say
it
is
a
proper
hospital
use.
mr.
roger
tilbury
i
can
hardly
speak
for
them
but
i
would
think
so.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no
sir,
no
i
do
not
disagree
with.
if
it
is
used
--
excuse
me.
mr.
roger
tilbury
regardless
your
honor
of
whether
they
call
it.
whatever
they
call
it,
if
it
is
used
at
the
hospital,
under
hospital
doctors,
on
the
premises,
for
consumption
their,
then
this
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
congress
intended.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir,
if
it
is
used
at
the
hospital.
mr.
roger
tilbury
my
own
position
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so,
because
the
point
of
consumption
is
no
longer
at
the
hospital.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
incidently
that
is
not
a
difficult
thing,
because
once
he
leaves
the
hospital,
the
hospital
rules
and
the
oregon
statutes
and
the
statutes
in
every
state
that
i
am
aware
of
requires
that
he
would
be
given
a
prescription
number.
they
actually
will
repackage
it
in
those
situations
or
there
are
supposed
to
under
the
state
law
and
they
do
i
think,
and
assigned
a
number
at
the
point
he
leaves
the
hospital,
because
it
is
no
longer
under
the
hospital
control
or
supervision,
and
when
they
came
to
congress
and
asked
for
this
they
talked
in
terms
of
the
need
and
extending
the
care
to
the
needy
patient.
this
was
the
thing
that
was
stressed.
now
the
hospital
is
not
providing
care
when
the
individual
is
no
longer
at
the
hospital.
by
definition
he
cannot
be
extended
the
care
of
the
hospital
if
he
is
not
at
the
hospital
and
this
is
our
position
and
i
think
this
is
what
congress
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes
sir.
mr.
roger
tilbury
i
think
it
is;
i
think
it
is.
mr.
roger
tilbury
well
your
honor
my
difficulty
is
this
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
well
i
do
not
visualize
it
as
such
perhaps
your
honor
may
disagree
with
me,
but
the
fact
is
that
what
is
an
inpatient
and
an
outpatient
is
a
matter
of
definition
and
there
is
considerable
disagreement
among
hospital
administrators
as
to
what
that
term
means.
but
i
think
when
congress
spoke
in
terms
of
care
and
supervision
and
for
their
own
use,
they
were
speaking
in
terms
of
the
hospital,
because
they
not
only
said
the
word
“their”
once,
they
used
the
word
twice
and
of
course,
they
use
the
terms
supplies
for
their
own
use.
and,
use
has
always,
as
far
as
i
know,
since
wycliffe
in
1388
said
that
that
means
consumption;
it
does
not
mean
that
you
resell
it
to
somebody
else
for
their
use.
we
are
talking
about
two
entirely
distinct
things
at
that
point.
and
at
the
point
that
the
hospital
has
no
more
control
over
it
in
the
case
that
justice
blackmun
mentioned
where
the
drugs
are
taken
home
for
consumption
at
the
point
it
leaves
the
hospital.
there
is
no
more
supervision
at
that
point.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
tilbury
at
the
point
he
leaves
the
hospital,
the
hospital
is
no
longer
using
it,
the
former
patient
is
using
it.
and
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
there.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
they
give
it
to
him
before
he
leaves
for
consumption
at
the
hospital,
yes.
mr.
roger
tilbury
it
is
not
the
used
by
the
hospital
and
i
think
we
have
to
use
the
language
that
congress
itself
used,
and
the
congressional
committee
said
that
at
the
point
it
leaves
the
hospital,
that
it
is
no
longer
the
hospital
is
using
it,
it
is
the
private
individual,
because
there
is
no
control
over
that
at
the
point
it
leaves
the
hospital.
mr.
roger
tilbury
well,
of
course,
that
is
true
in
the
sense
that
the
hospital,
a
corporation,
does
not
imbibe
and
use
the
drugs,
no.
but,
at
the
point
that
the
hospital
ceases
to
have
any
control
or
what
happens
to
those
drugs,
and
we
have
had
many
cases
where
we
found
that
they
have
not
only
given
them
a
medication
for
a
couple
of
days,
but
they
have
given
a
medication
for
six
months,
and
longer.
and
at
that
point,
incidently,
we
have
also
in
the
record
cases
where
they
have
actually
pour
sales
on
people
who
did
not
want
the
drugs
at
the
time
they
left
the
hospital,
but
found
it
on
their
bills,
and
when
they
protested,
they
were
not
able
to
have
it
removed
in
certain
cases.
and
incidentally,
the
quantum
of
the
use
is
not
the
one
percent
or
the
one-third
of
one
percent.
we
have
evidence
in
the
records
showing
that
in
the
case
of
kaiser,
it
is
well
over
400,000
prescriptions.
mr.
roger
tilbury
all
right,
in
the
case
of
saint
vincent’s
and
other
one
231,000
over
the
space
at
about
five
and
a
half
years.
in
the
case
of
good
samaritan,
it
is
roughly,
54
a
day,
these
are
not
minimal
things.
he
is
trying
apparently
to
argue
de
minimis
again,
although
at
various
times,
he
disavows
a
de
minimis
a
defense
here.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
they
do,
quite
often,
and
another
problem
is
that
they
charge
a
differential
price
to
their
in-patient
as
against
people
that
are
coming
off
the
street.
they
do
not
pass
along
the
savings
and
cost,
we
have
found
many
times
the
in-patient,
he
is
charged,
sometimes,
considerably
more
even
than
an
individual
that
went
to
the
corner
drugstore
to
buy.
but
then,
having
that
leverage,
plus
not
being
taxed,
which
they
are
not,
then
they
are
able
to
slash
the
market
considerably,
at
the
other
hand,
by
selling
the
drop
in
type
people,
people
having
no
connection
with
the
hospital.
now,
was
this
the
intent
of
congress
to
literally
destroy
the
corner
drugstore,
because
they
make
no
mistake
about
it.
i
do
not
exaggerate,
that
is
precisely
what
has
occurred
in
portland
and
will
occur
nationwide
and
does
occur.
this
sort
of
thing
is
a
real
source
of
danger.
i
do
not
think
that
there
was
the
intent
by
congress
to
upset
the
traditional
patterns
of
distribution
which
had
evolved
over
so
many
years.
we
say
this,
sure
the
hospital
perform
a
function
and
a
very
good
function.
fine,
let
us
preserve
them,
but
at
the
same
time
do
not
destroy
the
alternative
which
all
of
us
have
had
up
until
now.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
say
that;
i
say,
they
can
not.
mr.
roger
tilbury
i
say
this
that
if
they
decided
to
add
like
corner
drugstore,
they
should
pay
the
same
price.
mr.
roger
tilbury
only
that.
mr.
roger
tilbury
well,
13c
give
them
an
exemption
as
you
know,
for
certain
purposes.
now,
at
the
point,
it
is
no
longer
for
their
use
then
we
say
the
robinson-patman
act
applies,
and
that
they
should
freak
with
equality,
the
drugstores
and
the
hospitals.
if
the
hospital
conducts
its
operation
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
a
corner
drugstore,
and
they
are.
they
are
indistinguishable
in
many
cases,
and
it
is
not
limited
strictly
to
kaiser.
anyone
can
come
in
and
incidentally
the
amount
of
these,
we
have
found
we
have
triple
affidavits
in
the
file
saying
and
showing
that
it
is
very
easy
to
purchase
at
some
of
these
hospitals,
even
though
their
administrators
later
have
disavowed
it.
but
we
have
investigators
that
have
been
able
to
buy
them
with
complete
impunity,
and
not
have
it
questioned
at
all.
and
this
sort
of
this
sort
of
thing
is
going
to
happen
and
will
occur
with
greater
frequency,
unless
in
some
way,
this
court
says
that
that
law
means
what
it
says.
and
it
was
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
tilbury
i
do
not
feel
that
that
is
a
competitive
impact,
if
it
is
consumed
on
the
hospital
premises
by
an
inpatient.
mr.
roger
tilbury
may
i
--
excuse
me,
may
i
qualify
that.
i
do
not
say
that
there
would
be
a
competitive
effect
insofar
as
our
clients
are
concerned.
there
would
be
an
impact,
insofar,
as
a
profit
hospital
that
might
be
two
blocks
away.
so
in
this
regard,
the
law
was
changed.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
sir,
that
is
true,
but
i
did
want
to
point
out
that
that
change
did
take
place
because
of
13c,
because
now,
even
though
competition
is
affected,
they
may
discriminate
in
price,
in
favor
of
a
nonprofit
hospital,
even
though
it
may
have
rather
devastating
effects
to
a
profit
hospital.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
tilbury
it
clarified
the
law,
it
permitted
them
to
make
sales
within
the
hospital
because
congress
felt
in
1938
that
that
was
illegal.
both
the
senate
and
the
house
committees
and
also
the
letter
which
is
quoted
in
both
of
those
reports
from
the
men
who
then
headed
the
hospital
bureau
supplies
and
who
was
the
more
or
less,
the
(inaudible)
of
this
particular
bit
of
legislation.
mr.
roger
tilbury
if
in
light
of
the
present
case
law
that
is
true.
in
light
of
the
case
laws,
it
was
in
1938
congress
felt
that
that
was
an
illegal
operation.
now
i
am
willing
to
concede
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
that
could
be
a
primary
line,
yes
sir
mr.
roger
tilbury
that
is
true.
i
would
concede
it.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
certainly
correct
that
that
effect
also
took
place,
yes.
but
congress
certainly
felt
it
was
serving
a
function
in
passing
13c.
well,
congress
felt
it
was
illegal
at
that
point,
and
the
senate
committee
said
so,
and
so
did
the,
as
manufacture
said
it
had
now
made
it
illegal.
so,
this
change
was
brought
about
by
13c,
and
it
clarified
the
situation
of
the
in
hospital
use
as
well.
so
that
there
is
--
i
concede
it,
and
in
light
of
the
case
law
now
i
would
concede
that
probably,
even
then,
perhaps,
it
was
unnecessary
if
the
case
law
had
developed
to
the
point
that
it
now
had,
but
that
was
something
that
congress
was
not
in
the
position
to
forecast
accurately.
now,
again,
why
i
return
to
the
words
of
the
stature
which
i
think,
basically,
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
the
word
“supplies”
also
means
something
other
than
resale.
a
supply
wagon
in
the
days
of
old
vestment
supplies
went
through
a
particular
fort
or
a
particular
city
or
something
of
that
kind.
it
did
not
mean
the
things
that
were
going
to
be
sold
in
a
vendor’s
cart
from
door
to
door.
these
are
not
supplies,
and
“use”
means
--
and
certainly
under
all
of
the
use
taxes
in
every
sate
i
can
think
of,
that
at
the
point
something
is
resold
and
of
course,
this
is
the
astro
(ph)
case,
which
this
court
decided
in
1882,
when
you
talked
about
a
resale,
that
is
no
longer
a
“use”,
it
is
simply
supplying
something
to
be
used
by
somebody
else.
and
when
congress
stressed
the
word
“their”
twice,
their
supplies,
and
i
noticed
this
seems
to
be
dropped
occasionally,
from
the
petitioner’s
brief,
“their
supplies
for
their
own
use”,
that
word
“their”
used
twice,
certainly,
meant
the
hospital.
it
did
not
mean
the
private
consumption
of
somebody
off
the
premises
having
no
connection
with
the
hospital.
and
particularly,
when
they
went
to
congress
and
said,
“we
needed
to
take
care
of
the
needy
sick”,
with
any
institution.
mr.
roger
tilbury
well,
i
suppose
that
is
an
interesting
thought.
mr.
roger
tilbury
well,
they
can
do
it
for
experimental
purposes.
i
could
conceive
of
that,
but
that
is
about
the
only
exception.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no.
mr.
roger
tilbury
well,
i
do
not
interpret
it
that
way.
mr.
roger
tilbury
no,
i
would
not
so
limit
it.
i
think
in
the
case
of
that
by
the
patients
in
the
hospital,
that
is
certainly
a
permissible
thing.
no
question
about
it.
now,
i
might
say,
also,
that
at
the
very
least,
and
of
course
i
do
not
need
to
argue
extensively
the
point
that
this
was
decided
on
a
summary
judgment.
it
was
decided
at
the
early
stage
i
have
ever
seen
a
case
resolved
in
the
sense
that
we
had
no
meaningful
discovery,
we
were
not
permitted
to
ask
any
interrogatories,
no
motion
to
produce
what
is
permitted
to
us,
we
were
not
permitted
to
ask
the
depositions
or
take
the
depositions
of
a
single
one
of
any
of
the
petitioner’s
employees.
the
only
thing
we
were
permitted
to
ask
was
to
pose
a
few
of
the
hospital
people,
and
we
were
greatly
limited
there.
mr.
roger
tilbury
pardon
me.
mr.
roger
tilbury
did
i
win?
mr.
roger
tilbury
well
--
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
that
is
true,
but
in
the
lower
court
--
yeah,
sure.
in
the
lower
court,
we
had
to
go
with
a
very
handicapped
situation,
and
we
still
think
that
the
quantum
of
this
discrimination,
he
is
now
insisting,
it
is
like
one-third
of
one
percent.
we
think,
it
is
more
like
40%,
if
the
truth
emerges,
and
we
certainly
hope
that
it
does.
but
i
can
never
recall
a
case
in
my
own
experience
where
it
is
been
resolved
with
so
little
discovery.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
sir,
i
would
be
pleased
about
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
tilbury
that
is
true,
and
i
did
not,
yet
that
is
very
true.
now,
i
might
say
this,
our
target
is
not
the
entire
drug
industry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
will
notice,
we
have
only
sued
12
defendants
which
is
probably
enough
to
keep
me
talking
but
nevertheless,
only
11
of
these
actually,
because
one
is
a
holding
company.
there
are
many
drug
companies
in
this
field
including,
i
thought
lilly,
because
lilly
has
this
agreement
which
do
not
make
this
dichotomy
at
all.
they
do
recognize
the
law
and
do
have
a
unitary
price
insofar,
as
you
have
a
competitive
situation.
now,
this
case,
this
court
has
said
in
the
standard
oil
case
and
many
others,
in
the
robinson-patman
case
that
competitors
where
you
get
a
competitive
impact
should
start
from
the
same
plane,
and
that
is
all
we
ask.
we
asked
that
if
they
want
to
act
like
drugstores,
then
give
us
the
same
break.
please
let
us
acquire
the
same
drugs
and
then
let
the
consumer
make
the
choice.
if
he
prefers
a
hospital
to
us,
fine,
that
is
his
privilege,
but
i
do
not
think
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
race,
and
that
is
what
competition,
i
guess,
fundamentally
is,
that
one
competitor
should
start
off
10
yards
behind
the
rest
of
the
competitor.
and
that
is
what
where
we
are.
some
of
the
degree
of
competition
here
is
astounding.
i
believe
it
was
far
in
excess
of
anything
i
would
have
ever
imagined.
sometimes,
we
are
being
charged
five
times
what
the
hospital
is.
now,
if
the
drugstore,
and
i
say
this
quite
literally,
is
to
survive
then
they
must
be
given
a
chance
to
compete
on
fair
and
equal
terms.
they
are
not
being
given
that
chance
now,
and
they
have
challenged
me
on
the
numbers.
the
fact
is,
they
are
not
211
as
he
stated
in
his
required
brief,
in
portland,
at
the
present
time,
there
are
152.
and
if
you
want
to
go
strictly
at
the
city,
in
portland
itself,
there
are
only
64
within
the
city
limits,
for
a
city
of
450,000.
they
are
used
to
be
as
a
123
more
within
the
tri-county
area
as
our
map
in
the
back
of
our
exhibit
shows.
these
are
real
dangers,
we
thank
the
drugstores
as
part
of
the
american
scene
too,
but
it
will
no
longer
be
that.
mr.
roger
tilbury
at
the
present
time,
within
the
city
of
portland,
if
you
exclude
the
change,
your
honor,
there
are
64.
mr.
roger
tilbury
the
change
would
add,
within
the
city
limit
itself,
i
think
a
number
17
or
so,
something
like
that.
mr.
roger
tilbury
yes,
sir
and
not
--
that
is
kind
of
each
individual
retail
outlet,
even
though
it
maybe
part
of
a
chain,
but
this
is
a
problem,
and
it
is
really
as
i
mentioned,
just
in
passing
that
23
new
ones
have
opened.
well,
those
23
are
not
all
community
pharmacies
and
in
this
sense,
1971,
only
seven
of
those
are
what
we
normally
described
as
drugstores.
the
others
are
clinics,
there
are
nursing
homes,
there
are
things
of
this
kind,
which
--
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
