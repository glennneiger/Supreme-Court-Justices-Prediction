justice

what
about
this
refilling
prescription
in
hospital
by
former
patient
of
the
hospital
that
has
been
given
a
prescription
while
in
the
hospital
and
he
constantly
gets
it
refilled
at
the
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
exclude
those
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
suppose
that
the
hospital
is
on
one
side
of
the
street
and
it
has
established
a
retail
drugstore
on
the
other
side
of
the
street,
but
it
sells
drugs
to
walk-in
customers
in
both
places,
you
would
say
the
retail
drugstore
is
out
of
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
you
have
excluded
from
the
exemption
retail
drugstore.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
just
a
walk-in
customer,
who
is
never
been
in
the
hospital
before
who
is
not
about
to
be
again,
comes
in
to
buy
some
drugs.
he
does
not
want
to
cross
the
street
to
retail
drugstore
and
you
sell
it
to
him
out
of
the
drug
dispensary
in
the
hospital,
and
if
he
is
not
or
never
been
a
patient
in
the
hospital,
as
far
as
you
know
he
is
not
a
patient
of
anybody
on
the
staff
of
the
hospital,
you
just
sell
it
to
him.
now
is
that
--
what
connection
does
that
have
to
some
institutional
service
of
the
hospital?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
one
of
the
categories
mentioned
in
the
court’s
opinion
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
brought
the
case.
now
i
want
to
know
whether
you
think
we
should
agree
with
the
court
below
or
on
item
8
in
their
opinion
namely,
“walk-in
customers”.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
already
have
allowed
that,
did
they
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
know
they
excluded
from
the
exemption
of
the
dispensing
of
drugs
in
emergency
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
excluded
that
from
the
--
they
included
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
talking
about
some
other
kind
of
an
emergency.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
outpatients
include
the
outpatient
clinics.
does
it
not
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
the
outpatient
clinic
or
the
clinic
where
the
hospital
operates
a
clinic
for
the
public,
i
take
it,
the
doctors
are
hospital
agents
or
employees,
and
anyway
the
bill
the
patient
get
from
the
hospital.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
a
--
if
one
of
those
outpatients
in
an
outpatient
clinic
is
suddenly
hospitalized
and
is
there
a
week
and
then
he
is
discharged
but
still
an
outpatient
he
will
just
get
periodic
bills
from
the
hospital.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
an
instance,
how
about
a
(inaudible)
where
the
hospital
sells
in
the
hospital
or
in
the
clinic.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
hospital
in
their
premises?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
if
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
comes
under
two,
it
is
not
a
an
emergency
clinic;
it
is
not
an
emergency
clinic.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
to
that
is
within
the
exemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
not
broader
than
one
or
two.
well
that
is
what
i
assumed.
