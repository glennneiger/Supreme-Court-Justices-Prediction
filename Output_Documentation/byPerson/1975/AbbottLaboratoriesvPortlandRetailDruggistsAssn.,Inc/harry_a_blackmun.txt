justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
in
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
as
a
matter
of
their
own
self
imposed
policy
to
sell
drugs
to
their
own
employees
and
their
employees
families
that
had
cost
a
low
price
they
can
continue
to
do
so,
however,
this
case
is
decided,
can
they
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
a
surgeon
who
happens
to
practice
in
the
hospital
with
respect
to
his
office
patients?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
question
is
not
directed
to
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
that
was
one
of
the
categories
at
issue
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
take
that
one
step
further.
if
dr.
smith,
who
is
on
the
staff,
so
to
speak,
of
a
particular
hospital,
gives
an
office
prescription,
is
that
patient,
under
this
record,
free
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
have
it
filled
with
the
hospital
pharmacy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
it
does?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
just
said
for
consumption
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
the
prescription
given
to
an
inpatient
for
100
tablets
whatever
it
is
and
when
he
is
discharged
tomorrow
he
has
90
of
them
left
and
takes
them
home,
still
alright
under
the
robinson-patman
act?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
hospital
then,
on
your
theory,
would
have
to
purge
that
between
the
10
that
were
consumed
while
an
inpatient
and
the
90
that
he
took
home?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
going
back
to
the
clinic
case
an
outpatient
of
the
hospital
clinic
is
operated
on
the
hospital
premises
and
comes
in
regularly
for
shots
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
at
the
hospital.
now
you
say
apparently
that
that
is
within
the
exemption.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
that
is
certainly
broader
than
number
two
just
an
emergency.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
is
though,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
the
secondary
line
that
there
will
still
be
a
question
of
competition
for
clients
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
between
manufacturers.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
13c
would
serve
in
that
respect
in
any
event.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
portland
drugstores,
you
are
talking
about,
have
changed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
and
if
we
add
the
change?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
the
assignee
of
some
60
commercial
pharmacies
in
portland,
oregon,
and
it
brought
this
antitrust
action
against
abbott
laboratories
and
the
11
other
pharmaceutical
manufacturers.
the
charge
was
that
by
selling
drugs
to
hospitals,
each
of
which
has
a
pharmacy,
at
prices
lower
than
the
manufacturers
charge
other
retail
druggists
in
the
portland
area,
the
manufacturers
violated
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
act
makes
it
unlawful
for
one
engaged
in
commerce
to
discriminate
in
price
between
purchasers
of
like
commodities
where
the
effect
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
there
is
however
another
statute
called
the
nonprofit
institutions
act,
which
excludes
from
the
robinson-patman
act,
purchases
by
nonprofit
hospitals
of
their
supplies
for
their
own
use.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
hospitals
involved
were
nonprofit
and
that
all
their
drug
purchases
were
for
their
own
use
within
the
meaning
of
the
nonprofit
institutions
act.
it
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
manufacturers.
on
appeal,
the
ninth
circuit
vacated
and
remanded
concluding
that
a
hospital's
pharmaceuticals
are
purchased
for
its
own
use
only
where
dispensations
are
to
inpatients
and
to
emergency
facility
patients.
we
take
an
immediate
view.
we
hold
that
the
nonprofit
institutions
act
does
not
exempt
all
of
the
hospital's
drug
purchases
but
that
the
exempting
language
must
be
construed
as
applying
to
what
reasonably
may
be
regarded
as
use
by
the
hospital
in
the
sense
that
the
use
is
a
part
of
and
promotes
the
hospital's
intended
institutional
operation
in
the
care
of
its
patients.
when
we
apply
this
standard,
we
hold
that
drug
purchases
by
a
nonprofit
hospital
are
exempt
as
being
for
the
hospital's
own
use.
if
the
drugs
are
dispensed
to
the
inpatient
for
use
in
his
treatment
at
the
hospital,
or
to
the
emergency
facility
patient
for
use
there,
or
to
the
outpatient
for
personal
use
on
the
premises,
or
to
the
inpatient,
or
emergency
facility
patient,
upon
his
discharge,
and
to
the
outpatient
for
off-premises
personal
use,
provided
that
these
take-home
dispensations
are
for
a
limited
and
reasonable
time,
also
to
the
hospital
employee
or
student
for
personal
use,
or
the
use
of
his
dependent,
and
to
the
physician
staff
member
for
his
personal
use
or
the
use
of
his
dependent.
we
hold
that
purchases
for
the
following
types
are
not
exempt
since
they
are
not
for
the
hospital's
own
use;
to
the
former
patient,
by
way
of
a
renewal
or
refill,
or
to
non-dependents
of
the
employee
or
student
or
physician
staff
member,
or
to
the
walk-in
customer.
now
this
disposition
of
course
creates
some
possible
problems
for
the
hospital
pharmacy.
what
it
may
do
is
not
to
dispense
drugs
to
any
situation
outside
the
exemption,
or
it
can
establish
a
record-keeping
procedure
segregating
the
nonexempt
from
the
exempt
use.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
that
has
been
filed
by
the
clerk
today.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
marshall
while
joining
the
opinion
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
