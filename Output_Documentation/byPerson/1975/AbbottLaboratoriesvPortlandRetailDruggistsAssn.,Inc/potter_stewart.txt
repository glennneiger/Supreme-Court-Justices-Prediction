justice
potter
stewart
mr.
clarke,
this
case
process
down
despite
all
the
weight
and
breadths
and
lengths
length
of
the
brief
to
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
“for
their
own
use,”
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
read,
it
can
be
read
broadly
to
include,
i
suppose,
certainly
the
situation
that
the
chief
justice
referred
to,
the
hospital
pharmacy
selling
to
somebody
who
comes
in
off
the
street
in
an
emergency
or
otherwise,
because
that
is
for
the
use
of
the
hospital
and
the
profit
is
for
the
use
of
the
hospital.
justice
potter
stewart
that
can
be
read
broadly
certainly
and
to
the
extent
that
you
can
read
the
phrase
right
out
of
the
statute,
can
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
sell
drugs
to
make
money
and
they
do
make
money.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
the
sale
of
the
drugs
is
for
their
own
use.
justice
potter
stewart
the
profit
is
for
their
own
use.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
there
is
no
limit
on
this.
this
phrase
read
that
way
would
not
impose
any
limitation
at
all,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
with
hospital
patients?
justice
potter
stewart
because
a
hospital
can
define
its
function,
it
can
say
we
are
going
into
the
retail
pharmacy
business
as
one
of
our
functions.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
clarke
before
you
sit,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
on
the
front
of
your
brief
and
on
the
inside
cover
of
your
brief
are
listed
several
petitioners
in
this
case.
i
think
those
lists
are
not
identical.
may
i
ask,
are
there
any
other
petitioners?
justice
potter
stewart
specifically
may
i
ask
is
american
(ph)
company
a
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
when
you
say
you
would
not
object
you
can
see
that
that
would
be,
the
purchase
of
those
drugs
would
have
been
purchased
by
the
hospital
for
their
own
use?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
insist
on
that
limitation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
literally,
as
my
brother
rehnquist
says,
then
all
it
would
be
--
then
the
only
supplies
actually
used
by
hospital
would
be
things
like
furniture
and
so
on,
but
in
the
area
of
drugs,
would
just
be
for
their
own
experiment
corporate
use.
justice
potter
stewart
for
corporate
consumption.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
individual
retail
outlets?
