are
they
all
physically
located
within
the
hospitals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
are
not
wholly
miles
apart
from
the
hospital?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
diverged
on
another
ground
by
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
then
by
your
definitions
the
hospital
presumed
by
determines
its
own
function,
and
if
it
decides
that
that
function
should
be
performed
out
on
the
series
of
retail
outlets
of
separated
from
the
hospital
you
would
still
say
that
by
selling
buffering
and
aspirin
in
those
outlets
it
is
performing
a
function
which
their
customer
need.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
yet
to
hear
for
you
any
place
where
you
would
limit
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
kaiser
had
a
different
kind
of
operation
now
than
the
other
hospitals,
and
then
its
summary
judgement
was
reversed
on
a
much
broader
ground
about
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
lawsuit
has
got
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
they
exist,
i
presume.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
reading,
use
by
the
hospital
than
use
in
the
hospital.
i
mean,
there
is
no
use
by
the
hospital
in
the
sense
that
the
hospital
as
an
institution
does
not
itself
take
any
drug,
it
is
patient
that
take
drug.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
kaiser
is
not
here
in
any
capacity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
what
the
economic
impact
of
hospital
sales
is
on
the
drugs
--
to
the
hospital
pharmacies
under
sale
the
drugstores.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
be
more
precise,
that
has
to
mean
for
the
use
of
the
hospitalâ€™s
own
patients.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
because
if
you
are
talking
about
the
use
of
the
hospital,
the
hospital
does
not
use
the
drug.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
not
what
you
are
arguing
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
to
cross
petition
to
bring
before
us
any
problem
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
summary
judgment
hearing
in
the
district
court,
i
would
think.
