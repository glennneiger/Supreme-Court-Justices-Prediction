justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
devoted
a
bit
of
your
argument
to
a
problem
that
involves,
as
i
understand
and
what
you
said,
less
than
one
percent
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
one
third
of
one
percent,
may
we
come
back
to
what
seems
to
me
to
be
more
substantial,
i
have
in
mind
at
the
moment,
outpatient
operations.
you
said
there
were
two
categories
of
those:
the
traditional
outpatients
departments
that
save
for
the
most
part
indigents;
and
secondly
a
newer
type
of
outpatient
department
that
save
that
probably
generally
primarily
to
relieve
the
threatened
of
inpatient
service
for
which
facilities
are
inadequate.
now
are
they
--
are
both
of
these
functions
performed
from
the
same
outpatient
facilities,
or
do
you
have
different
type
of
facilities
for
the
two?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
satellites
in
two
of
the
12
hospitals,
i
thought
you
said
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
basically
the
same
facilities
save
both
types
of
patients?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right
and
you
said,
as
i
understood
it
that
outpatients
are
registered.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
when
a
prescription
is
issued
to
a
registered
outpatient,
does
a
prescription
show
on
its
face
that
the
patient
is
a
registered
patient,
so
that
the
pharmacist
can
distinguish
between
the
registered
outpatient
and
the
walk-in
non-patient.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
identifies
him
as
a
registered
outpatient.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
outpatients
who
are
registered
cannot
be
identified.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
it
is
basically
possible
to
devise
means
to
identify
a
registered
patient.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
another
question
i
want
to
ask
relates
to
renewals
of
prescription
for
inpatients.
you
said
that
this
ordinarily
occurred
at
the
time
of
a
discharge,
prescription
being
provided
for
the
patient
to
take
home
with
him
or
her.
does
the
record
show
a
percentage
of
renewals
that
occur
or
have
occurred
according
to
this
record
subsequent
to
discharge
at
the
hospital,
in
other
words
repetitive
renewals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
tilbury.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
draw
the
line
that
whether
or
not
the
drugs
were
consumed
on
the
premises
of
the
hospital.
suppose
there
were
no
section
13c
at
all,
would
there
be
any
competition
with
respect
to
drugs
consumed
on
the
premises
of
the
hospital?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
alright.
so
that,
with
respect
to
the
drugs,
would
you
think
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
involves
only
your
clients.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
terms
of
the
interest,
you
represent
your
clients.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
purpose
that
section13c
said
in
light
of
your
view
of
the
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
says
no
adverse
effect
on
competition
resulting
from
drugs
consumed
within
the
hospitals,
you
never
get
to
13c,
do
you?
