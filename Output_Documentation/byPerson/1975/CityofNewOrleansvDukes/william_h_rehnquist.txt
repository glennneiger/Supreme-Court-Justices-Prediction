mr.
loeffelholz,
will
all
that
really
is
involved
on
this
jurisdictional
place
whether
you
should
come
here
by
appeal
or
by
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
are
we
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
state?s
interest
is
compelling
when
you
are
simply
dealing
with
ordinary
economic
legislation?
i
thought
that
the
test
you
read
earlier
is
that
if
any
set
of
facts
can
be
conceived,
even
hypothetically,
that
would
justify
the
legislature?s
action;
the
law
will
be
sustained.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
we
weigh
any
interest
in
this
court
in
connection
with
legislation?
is
that
not
the
job
for
the
legislature
of
the
city
council
to
pick
out
an
interest
and
support
it?
what
if
they
wanted
to
give
lucky
dogs
a
monopoly
in
the
vieux
carre?
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
determine
what
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
what
the
object
sought
is
in
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
just
wanted
one
hotdog
peddler
of
vieux
carre?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
city
council
sits
down
and
decides
?we
do
not
want
five
well-behaved
hotdog
vendors;
we
want
one
well-behaved
hotdog
vendor.?
is
there
anything
unconstitutional
about
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
constitutional
requirement?
who
owns
the
astrodome
in
new
orleans?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
superdome.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
state
of
louisiana
have
to
have
public
bidding
on
its
concessions
there
or
can
it
just
pick
somebody
out
and
say
?the
superdome
can
only
accommodate
one
concessionary.
you
are
it.?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
there
were
not,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
would
there
be
requirement
for
public
bidding?
