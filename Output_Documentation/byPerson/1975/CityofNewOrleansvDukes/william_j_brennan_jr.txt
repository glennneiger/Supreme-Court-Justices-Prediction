and
our
rationality
test
did
not
say
the
exception
in
the
illinois
statute
in
morey
and
doud.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have
gotten
out
of
syllabus,
i
gather,
that
even
though
it
did
not
there,
the
grandfather
clause
here
is
saved
by
the
rationality
test,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
here
you
have,
i
gather,
a
hotdog
vendor,
lucky
something
of
that,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
lucky
dogs,
and
they
have
been
doing
business
in
the
french
quarter
for
eight
years
or
more,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
over
eight
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
this
particular
appellee
has
been
a
competitor
of
lucky
dogs
for
only
two
years,
right?
justice
william

morey
and
doud
says
that
kind
of
monopoly
could
not
withstand
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
only
one
allowed
to
sell
without
license
whenever
they
were
involved,
i
have
forgotten,
was
american
express
co.
justice

by
name,
american
express.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
the
ordinance
say
of
anybody
except
lucky
dogs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
vendor,
no
matter
what
he
sells
in
the
french
quarter,
i
gather,
who
has
been
selling
over
eight
years
can
continue
its
selling.
it
is
only
vendors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
but
that
distinction
there,
i
gather,
is
street
vendors
no
matter
what
they
sell,
and
would,
if
they
were
selling
over
eight
years
i
gather,
be
allowed
to
continue
selling.
is
that
right?

what
is
her

she
does
not
sell
ice

justice
william

brennan,

lucky
dogs,
they
have
more
than
one
of
these
carts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
it
a
corporation
or
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

likely
to
be
quite
a
long
time
that
that
has
legislative
monopoly,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
what
about
this
other

vendor?
