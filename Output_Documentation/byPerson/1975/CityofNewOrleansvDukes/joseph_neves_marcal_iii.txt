mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
begin
by
pointing
out
that
when
you
consider
the
legislative
history
to
this
permit
law,
it
takes
on
an
entirely
different
aspect
as
presented
by
the
city.
this
is
not
simply
an
identification
of
a
public
interest
sending
out
of
bids,
obtaining
people
to
bid
on
a
lucky
draw
push
cart
or
whatever
maybe
that
particular
interest.
this
legislative
history,
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out
and
outline
in
my
brief,
is
nothing
but
an
indication
to
me
of
what
i
would,
in
best
terms,
describe
as
legislative
chicanery
and
i
follow
this
permit
ordinance
through
other
controversies,
and
if
i
can
backup
and
demonstrate
first
to
the
court,
as
i
have
tried
to
touch
in
my
brief,
where
the
city
of
new
orleans
is
doing
something
other
than
it
would
pretend
in
this
situation.
that
is,
preserve
the
charm
and
beauty
of
vieux
carre.
firstly,
the
city
of
new
orleans
long
ago,
in
1942,
treated
with
its
permit
ordinance
in
a
legitimate
effort
to
regulate
peddlers
on
the
street
and
people
who
generally
go
about
the
streets
of
new
orleans
hawking
their
wares
or
attempting
to
sell
their
wares.
it
was
not
about
until
around
1970,
as
i
treat
in
my
brief,
that
the
city
first
began
to
regulate
such
things
as
religious
activity,
benevolence,
and
education
amid
the
streets
of
the
vieux
carre.
it
is
no
coincidence
that
at
the
same
time
that
the
city
took
upon
itself
to
legislate
and
actually
prohibit
religious
activity
on
the
streets
of
vieux
carre
which
precipitated
a
case
before
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
which
i
did
handle
and
was
successful
in
denouncing
that
particular
ordinance
as
it
restricted
religious
activity.
but
they
also
took
upon
themselves
to
begin
to
create
--
first,
they
created
exemptions.
they
said
?generally,
all
permits
are
banned
from
the
french
quarter
except
the
following
exemptions?,
and
this
is
where
they
began
their
scheme,
the
discriminatory
scheme.
now,
whether
or
not
that
was
correct
or
not,
i
am
not
going
to
deal
with
it
at
this
time.
that
is
not
the
issue
here,
but
i
am
giving
the
court,
hopefully,
an
idea
of
the
background
reiterating
this
background.
they
said
?all
permits
are
banned
with
the
exception
of
the
following:?
paragraph
5
which
is
the
important
and
crucial
paragraph
dealing
with
hot
tamale
pushcarts,
and
hot
tamale
and
hotdog
pushcarts,
and
alike.
they
were
satisfied
with
this
for
a
time.
now,
at
the
time
that
they
passed
this
ordinance,
which
is
in
the
latter
part
of
the
1971,
nancy
dukes
was
operating
her
pushcart
selling
food,
stuffs,
hotdogs,
cotton
candy,
confections
and
alike
on
the
street.
she
was
selling
hotdogs.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
is
a
term
of
a
phrase,
justice
stewart,
which
i
feel
is
unfortunate.
i
did
not
supervise
the
confection
of
that
document,
but
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
but
that
is
what
the
record
shows
undoubtedly.
it
does.
my
understanding
and
appreciation
was
that
she
was
selling
hotdogs
among
other
things.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
not
as
far
as
the
record
and
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
the
record,
my
understanding,
it
was
before
the
lower
court
judge
gordon
and
he
did
consider
that
and
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
it
is
inarticulately
termed
and
that
is
the
only
explanation
i
can
offer
this
court.
it
is
inarticulately
and
within
confection
was
hotdog.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
was
responsible
for
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
there
was
no
stipulation
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
it
obtained
it
from
my
brief.
i
handled
the
brief
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
my
understanding
based
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
oral
argument.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
is
correct,
apparently
so,
because
that
was
my
understanding.
i
did
not
represent
ms.
dukes
before
the
lower
court,
and
that
was
my
understanding
based
upon
the
records
and
documents
i
had
in
my
file.
there
are
several
statements
contained
in
the
record
indicating
this
to
me
and
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
was
the
material
facts
submitted
by
the
city
in
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
submitted
to
the
lower
court,
the
district
court.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
the
reading
of
the
record
and
the
stipulations,
it
left
me
with
the
conclusion
that
she
was
selling
hotdogs
among
other
foodstuffs.
she
does
not
concentrate.
she
never
has
and
never
suggested
that
she
sold
merely
hotdogs;
she
sold
other
foodstuffs,
and,
thus,
she
has
the
two-prong
attack.
unfortunately,
the
first
attack,
that
is
the
discriminatory
treatment
as
to
the
other
exemptions
was
the
only
attack
contained
in
the
original
complaint,
subsequent
in
an
amendment
compliant
with
the
amendments
brought
on
by
city
council
that
was
indicated
that
the
grandfather
clause
was
also
objectionable
and,
of
course,
there
were
also
statements
of
material
facts
contained
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
no,
they
only
sell
hotdogs.
my
client
sells
foodstuffs
generally
which,
again,
inarticulately
termed
in
the
stipulation.
as
i
said,
i
had
no
supervision
over
the
confection
of
the
lower
court
pleadings.
i
was
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
it
was
my
understanding
from
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
stuck
with
it.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
certainly
hope
i
can.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
would
think
that
those
sugar-based
foodstuffs
that
would
be
generally
sold.
i
have
relied
heavily
on
foodstuffs
in
arguing
this.
by
the
way,
there
was
no
indication
that,
to
my
knowledge
before
the
fifth
circuit,
of
an
objection
to
the
statement
--
throughout
my
brief
before
the
fifth
circuit
that
we
were
dealing
with
hotdogs
and
it
only
comes
before
your
honors
now.
i
think
this
issue
could
have
been
pointed
out
before
the
fifth
circuit,
at
least,
by
my
brother
opponent,
if
i
make
it
back
to
what
i
consider
it
as
a
treatment
of
the
facts
in
this
case
as
it
relates
to
the
law.
first,
the
city
dealt
with
its
exemptions
and
they
said
all
permits
are
banned
with
the
following
exemptions,
and
paragraph
5
was
the
exemption
which
dealt
with
the
hot
tamale
and
hotdog
pushcart.
they
said
you
could
obtain
a
permit
to
do
this
in
the
french
quarter
area.
well,
low
and
behold,
my
client
acting
under
the
assumption
that
they
have
authority
not
only
to
sell
hotdogs,
they
took
it
upon
themselves,
other
foodstuffs,
but
they
were
selling
hotdogs
at
the
time
of
her
arrest.
one
of
her
employees,
in
january
of
1972,
was
arrested
for
selling
hotdogs
and
foodstuffs
in
the
vieux
carre.
in
the
face
of
this
very
specific
paragraph
5
exemption
from
the
general
ban
in
the
french
quarter.
and,
of
course,
this
made
it
very
wary.
as
indicated
in
the
record,
these
charges
were
ultimately
dismissed.
subsequent
to
that,
in
april
of
1972,
there
appears
the
grandfather
clause
which
says
that
all
persons
as
of
january
of
1972
--
it
was
retroactive
though
passed
in
april
of
?72.
all
persons
prior
to
january
of
?72
who
have
not
operated
in
the
vieux
carre
area
for
more
than
eight
years
cannot
obtain
any
permits
aside
from
the
fact
that
they
did
create
some
exempt.
they
still
had
the
exemptions
there.
now,
this
lawsuit
was
filed
in
august
of
1972.
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
city
again
amended
its
statute
and
deleted
paragraph
5,
the
hotdog
and
hot
tamale
pushcart
exemption.
i
submit
that
that
is
an
indication
that
they
had
a
particular
specific
design
as
to
hotdog
and
hot
tamale
pushcart.
they
wanted
to
favor
them
very
specifically.
now,
why
did
they
not
do
the
same
thing
for
the
flower
vendors
in
the
quarter?
they
are
exempted.
i
think
that
is
in
paragraph
4
below
by
paragraph
45
or
35
or
something
like
this.
no,
they
concentrated
on
the
hotdog
and
the
hot
tamale
pushcart
exemption,
because
obviously
they
saw
the
conflict
there
that
we
could
not,
at
one
hand,
grant
them
an
exemption
but
then,
on
the
other
hand,
take
it
away
with
the
eight-year
grandfather
clause.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
is
correct.
i
do
not
understand
the
question,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
to
the
mention
of
foodstuffs
and
hotdogs
in
the
lower
court,
the
statement
of
material
facts
at
page
78
of
appendix
volume
1,
submitted
by
the
city,
indicates
in
a
statement
made
by
then
attorney
representing
ms.
dukes,
okla
jones,
that
plaintiff
nancy
dukes
does
business
under
her
name
with
louisiana
concession,
and
is
engaged
in
sale
and
distribution
of
foodstuffs,
drinks,
confections,
and
novelties.
and,
at
page
84
of
the
same
volume
1--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
and
at
page
84,
mr.
loeffelholz,
then
still
representing
the
city,
indicated
the
same
thing
in
a
separate
statement
of
material
facts
that
plaintiff
nancy
dukes
was
engaged
in
the
sale
and
distribution
of
foodstuff
drinks
and
confections
and
novelties.
i
submit
that
hotdogs
are
within
foodstuffs.
further,
i
also
submit
that
whether
or
not
--
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
submit
that
it
was
a
point
of
reference
by
judge
goldberg
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
i
submit
that,
ultimately,
it
is
irrelevant
to
these
issues
in
so
far
as
we
have
an
unconstitutional
statute
which,
i
submit,
not
only
is
unconstitutional
in
its
application,
but
also
on
its
face
getting
to
the
statute
itself
and,
aside
from
the
arguments
on
jurisdiction
which
i
have
submitted
in
brief
form
and
i
would
not
dwell
on
that
particular
issue.
the
unusual
character
of
this
discrimination
created,
while
it
does
not
make
it
subject
to
the
language
of
the
court
cited
in
naacp
versus
button
or
any
such
cases
where
they
are
dealing
with
the
elective
franchise,
those
very,
very
fundamental
rights.
nevertheless,
i
submit
that
the
language
of
morey
versus
doud,
and
nothing
is
taken
away
from
morey
by
mcgowan
as
i
submit.
i
argue
to
the
court
that
there
must
be
some
relationship
between
t
object
sought
in
this
statute
and
the
discrimination
created
by
the
statute.
it
is
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
the
object
is
stated
by
the
city
on
appeal,
justice
rehnquist,
i.e.,
to
preserve
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
it
is
beyond
myself
to
understand.
i
do
not
understand
how
eight
years,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
spreading
the
mustard
on
hotdog
somehow,
rather,
is
going
to
contribute
more
to
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre
than
merely
one
year
or
a
year-and-a
half
of
doing
the
exact
same
thing
on
the
part
of
mrs.
dukes.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
very
well
if
that
is
what
they
wanted,
what
they
could
have
done,
which
they
did
not
do
and
this
statute
does
not
do,
they
could
have
set
standards
of
behavior
for
hotdog
salesmen,
which
promote
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
a
regulation
and
that
opportunity
would
be
given
to
all
individuals
to
apply
for
that
position
to
be
the
one
well-behaved
hotdog
vendor.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
it
is
the
superdome.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
it
is
owned
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
there
is
a
great
deal
of
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
complied
with
louisiana
law,
but
my
understanding
is
that
there
is
a
requirement
for
public
bidding
in
louisiana
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
think
that
the
operation
that
morey
versus
doud,
mcgowan,
and
the
language
of
this
court
consistently
reiterate
and
would
come
into
play,
that
when
you
seek
to
regulate
someone
the
right
to
earn
a
living
which
is
certainly
one
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
granted
to
each
individual
citizen
of
this
country,
you
must
base
your
discriminatory
scheme
upon
some
rational
basis
which
promotes
what
you
are
trying
to
protect,
your
public
interest
created.
and,
i
do
not
think
that
any
ordinance,
any
city
council,
any
state
legislature
can
simply
decide
that
it
is
going
to
favor
one
man
over
another
person
for
no
other
reason
other
than
it
decides
to
favor
him.
now,
i
suspect
that
the
city
council,
i
feel
that
the
city
council,
only
had
one
purpose
and
it
was
not
to
promote
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
it
was
simply
to
favor
lucky
dogs.
and,
i
point
to
the
legislative
history
behind
this
particular
ordinance.
it
does
not
speak
of
a
deliberation
about
what
is
the
public
interest
in
the
vieux
carre,
what
should
we
do
about
this
problem?
it
is
taken
for
granted
by
myself
that
it
is
one
of
the
interests
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
to
protect
the
vieux
carre.
however,
the
manner
in
which
they
proceed,
that
is
simply
saying
?well,
if
you
have
been
for
eight
years
it
is
alright,
you
can
continue
to
be
there.?
now,
how
that
promotes,
how
that
can
be
made
to
promote
in
anyone?s
mind
that
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre
is
beyond
me?
there
are
no
standards
as
to
the
design
and
the
decor
of
these
pushcarts
or
the
hotdogs,
what
type
of
hotdogs,
what
grade
of
hotdogs?
there
are
no
standards
of
behaviour
for
the
hotdog
salesman.
there
are
not
even
minimal
health
standards
applicable
to
the
sale
of
hotdogs,
which
somehow
or
rather
would
promote
the
charm
and
view
of
the
vieux
carre.
there
is
none
of
this.
all
we
have
is
a
rather
colored
legislative
history,
which
i
detailed
in
my
brief
before
this
court
and
before
the
fifth
circuit,
which
i
might
add,
your
honors,
was
not
mentioned
before
the
lower
court
in
any
detail
whatsoever.
the
first
time
that
united
states
court
of
any
moment
had
before
it
the
legislative
history
was
before
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal.
before
the
lower
court,
and
i
did
not
represent
this
lady
before
the
lower
court,
there
was
not
one
mention
of
the
legislative
history.
there
was
not
one
detail
on
how
this
particular
ordinance
evolved
into
its
present
state.
there
was
no
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
the
issues
now,
i
would
submit
that
the
legislative
history
is
very
important
to
the
court?s
consideration
because
i
think
it,
in
and
of
itself,
belies
the
statement
that
this
particular
ordinance
promotes
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
there
was
nothing
in
that
ordinance.
if
anything,
there
was
something,
there
was
a
damming
trend
apparent
in
the
ordinances
to
simply
get
rid
of
what
the
city
of
new
orleans
considers
undesirables.
in
one
case,
they
thought
it
was
the
hare
krishna
people
going
about
the
vieux
carre.
in
another
instance,
it
happens
to
be
the
flower
people.
all
of
these
exemptions
did
not
come
about
merely
because
the
city
of
new
orleans
decided
that
these
exemptions
promote
the
charm
and
beauty.
each
one
of
them
practically
has
a
story
behind
it.
the
ice
cream
vendor.
a
story
of
litigation,
the
flower
salesman
had
a
long
history
of
litigation
behind
him.
this
is
not
such
a
thoughtful
objective
consideration
of
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
i
only
point
that
out
because
much
is
made
of
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
i
think
the
legislative
history
belies
that
besides
the
act
itself.
there
were
no
standards
set,
there
was
no
reasonable
relationship
between
the
discrimination,
i.e.,
if
you
have
been
there
for
eight
years
you
can
sell
hotdogs
but
you
cannot
if
you
have
been
any
less.
and,
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre,
how
is
it
promoted?
being
a
lifelong
resident
of
the
city
of
new
orleans,
i
can
say,
as
i
have
stated
in
the
brief,
that
these
hotdog
pushcarts
in
no
way
contribute
to
the
charm
and
beauty.
i
think
that
much
was
made
in
the
appendices
provided
by
myself
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
city
of
new
orleans,
attached
to
its
brief,
of
the
character
of
these
pushcarts.
they
do
not
lend
it
to
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre,
which
is
that
most
of
the
architecture
goes
back
to
the
1700s
and
the
1800s
as
new
orleans
was
then.
it
has
been
preserved.
and
then,
we
have
what
subsequently
followed
and
what
i
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
the
city
expanded
the
operation
of
this
ordinance
as
grandfather
clause,
not
only
it
went
beyond
the
vieux
carre
area,
it
went
to
the
central
business
district.
now,
as
it
stands,
though
it
was
not
the
case
when
this
case
was
decided
in
the
lower
court,
and
i
point
this
out
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
bogus
suggestion
made
by
the
city
that
this
promotes
the
charm
and
beauty.
now,
the
grandfather
clause
operates
not
only
in
the
vieux
carre,
but
over
the
central
business
district
which
has
no
relationship.
there
is
nothing
charming
or
beautiful
about
concrete
and
asphalt.
and
the
city
continues
to
do
things
in
past
ordinances
subsequent
to
this
which
really
contradict
their
position
here
taken
today,
and
i
think
the
court
should
be
apprised
of
that.
now,
she
cannot
even
sell,
ms.
dukes
cannot
even
sell
in
the
central
business
district.
now,
there
might
be
a
different
reason
for
that.
i
do
not
know.
who
knows,
why?
but
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
that
is
in
the
record.
i
cited
those
particular
ordinances
and
put
them
in
my
appendix.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
stated
in
the
brief,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
she
is
not
in
there
though
it
is
not
in
the
record
because
at
the
time
she
could
have
possibly
gone
into
the
central
business
district,
but
i
point
this
out
simply
to
reiterate
the
point
that
this
is
not
a
serious
position
taken
by
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
somehow
or
rather
allowing
a
hotdog
salesman
to
be
in
any
place
in
the
city
simply
because
he
has
been
there
eight
years
which
just
happens
to
coincide
with
the
fact
that
there
is
no
one
who
has
been
there
longer
than
eight
years
who
was
selling
hotdogs
or
any
other
thing.
that
does
not
somehow
aid
to
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
i
mean,
they
first
said
the
reason
for
this
legislation
and,
i
would
submit,
that
they
are
not
making
a
suit
to
fit
a
man.
they
are
taking
a
man,
that
is
lucky
dogs,
and
having
him
fit
the
law.
and,
it
is
an
afterthought,
and
that
is
all
that
this
is.
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
bear-face
monopoly,
and
it
is
not
like
the
situation
of
ladue
cited
by
my
brother
opponent.
in
so
far
as
there,
you
had
a
situation
of
a
creation
of
monopoly,
a
statewide
monopoly
for
the
transit
system,
granted
there
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
to
maintain
a
transit
system,
which
was
reliable,
which
could
be
controlled
by
state
agency.
in
that
situation,
undoubtedly,
they
were
bids
put
out.
somebody
had
to
qualify
for
that
position
or
whatever.
there
were
qualifications
and
there
were
standards
set.
here,
we
do
not
have
any
of
that.
all
of
a
sudden,
in
the
middle
of
april
of
1972,
they
passed
a
law
retroactive
to,
january
of
?72,
and
said
?everybody
who
was
here
for
beyond
eight
years
passed,
in
going
back
to
january
of
1972,
can
stay
here.
and,
ms.
dukes,
you
have
only
been
here
for
two
years
and
you
cannot
stay
here.?
that
is
irrational.
to
allow
these
people
to
do
this
would
allow
them
to
run
rush
shot
over
other
individuals
of
the
callow
of
mrs.
dukes
who
obviously,
i
think
the
court
can
take
notice,
is
not
financially
well
here
and
is
a
small
person
as
opposed
to
lucky
dogs.
and
i
would
say,
as
to
monopolies,
they
are
generally
created
only
after
an
interest
is
established,
an
interest
which,
here,
protection
of
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre,
but
still
you
can
not
--
though
you
can
establish
a
monopoly,
you
still
cannot
get
away
from
the
language
of
morey
v.
doud
and
mcgowan.
you
have
to
establish
some
rational
relationship
between
the
discrimination
and
the
particular
purpose
of
the
law.
there
has
to
be
some
supportive
facts
that
support
this
discrimination.
and,
here,
we
find
none,
except
that
it
is
suppose
to
support
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
using
some
of
the
language
of
judge
goldberg,
it
is
inconceivable
to
me,
how
favoring
a
venerable
hotdog
vendor
with
the
skins
of
eight
seasons
over
one
with
merely
the
skins
of
two
seasons,
somehow
or
other
promotes
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
it
does
not
and
i
would
also
submit,
as
i
have
touched
upon
before,
that
the
statute
itself,
and
i
reiterate,
establishes
a
monopoly
for
a
lucky
business,
that
is
lucky
dogs.
it
gives
no
opportunity
to
anyone
else
to
provide
a
hotdog
which
is
better,
able
to
promote
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
if
you
would
assume
that
a
hotdog
can
somehow
or
other
promotes
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre.
and
also,
it
creates
a
close
class.
there
is
no
possibility,
as
pointed
out
by
judge
goldberg,
though
it
usually,
in
the
morey
v.
doud
situation
you
had
there
someone
who
was
identified
in
the
act.
as
judge
goldberg
pointed
out
in
his
decision
before
the
fifth
circuit,
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
the
only
person
who
could
possibly
qualify
for
this
would
be
lucky
dogs,
mean
that
there
was
just
nobody
else
who
could
possibly
ever
qualify
for
this.
and,
judge
goldberg
took
notice
of
this
in
his
decision
in
the
footnote.
and
i
submit,
and
as
i
pointed
out
before,
there
is
nothing
which
one
could
assume,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
that
a
hotdog
can
do
for
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
person
who
is
selling
it
has
been
there
eight
years
selling
it.
we
are
not
talking
about
as
an
eslin
case
out
of
florida,
which
i
cited
for
your
consideration,
the
situation
of
favoring
doctors,
such
as
doctors
who
would
seek
to
be
licensing,
and
exempt
these
doctors
from
the
operation
of
the
licensing
law
on
the
basis
that
they
have
been
practicing
for
four
years.
we
are
not
dealing
with
doctors.
we
are
dealing
with
what
has
generally
been
considered
that
a
transient
vendor
who
was
selling
hotdogs
on
the
street
corners
of
new
orleans.
and,
there
is
nothing
so
qualifying
about
continually
putting
transient
vendors
in
the
street
for
eight
years,
which
would
justify
this
type
of
discrimination
and
go
into
and
violate
and
deny
nancy
dukes
her
right
to
earn
a
living,
which
was
one
of
the
established
constitutional
rights
and
privileges.
it
has
been
established
in
coryell
versus
corfield,
cited
with
approval
in
shapiro
v.
thompson,
and
noted
by
this
court.
the
right
to
earn
a
living
is
something
you
simply
cannot
take
away
from
a
person,
and
this
is
what
this
statute
does
without
any
rational
basis
whatsoever.
if
you
really
look
at
it
--
and
i
submit
further,
and
again
in
a
repetition,
there
was
nothing
so
unique
about
selling
hotdogs
for
eight
years
that
could
somehow
or
other
contribute
more
to
the
charm
and
beauty
of
the
vieux
carre
than
one
selling
it
for
merely
two
years.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
but
it
is
my
knowledge
and
i
have
it
reasonable
sources
that
her
pushcart
was
painted
over.
it
had
a
flower
arrangement
of
something
on
the
side
of
it
and
it
was,
now,
been
i
think
dismantled
that
she
is
trying
to
go
onto
another
business,
though
certainly,
she
would
like
to
get
back
in
vieux
carre.
it
is
a
very
lucrative
area
and,
certainly,
she
would
be
subject
to
any
reasonable
regulations,
if
this
statute
is
declared
unconstitutional.
now,
of
course,
that
does
not
really
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
no,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
and
i
know
of
nothing
as
to
the
distinctiveness
of
her
rig
as
opposed
to
lucky
dogs.
a
lucky
dogs
is
a
tin
arrangement
which
is
supposedly
resembling,
as
i
think
you
have
pictures
of
it
in
the
appendices.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
well,
i
think
they
are
subject
to
reasonable
regulations
and
that
they
must
move
on
and
not
interfere
with
the
flow
of
traffic.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
you
could
simply
eliminate
them
from
the
streets
in
favor
of
one
person
that
had
been
there
merely
for
eight
years
on
--
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
would
think
so,
if
they
desired,
but
you
cannot
have
this
type
of
discriminatory
scheme.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
subject
to
certain
regulations,
i
would
think
reasonable
regulations.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
again,
i
would
begin
with
the
right
which
is
regulated,
the
right
to
earn
a
living,
whether
that
is
reasonable,
whether
that
promotes
the
purposes.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
correct.
mr.
joseph
neves
marcal
iii
i
would
think
that
some
regulations
that
people
cannot
comply,
which
have
a
reasonable,
which
have
a
basis
--
excuse
me
--
there
are
regulations
that
certainly
can
be
supported,
can
be
substantiated
insofar
as
they
have
some
rational
connexity
with
the
desired
purpose.
that
is,
it
is
not
in
the
interest
of
the
vieux
carre
to
have
any
pushcarts,
i.e.,
we
are
going
to
phase
them
out
over
a
period
of
time.
i
could
speculate
all
sorts
of
regulations
and
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
do
that.
thank
you,
your
honor.
