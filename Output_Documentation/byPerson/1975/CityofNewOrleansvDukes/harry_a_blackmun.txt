justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
you
feel
morey
against
doud
has
no
application
here
at
all.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
did
not
cite
it
in
your
brief.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
did
in
your
jurisdictional
statement,
but
i
do
not
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
do
not
recall
this
in
your
brief
at
all.
so
i
assumed
you
felt
it
had
no
application.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
everything
you
say,
would
it
not
be
applicable
as
applicable
if
not
more
so
if
these
street
peddlers
were
all
eliminated,
and
you
had
no
grandfather
clause?
is
this
not
the
crux
of
your
problem?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
limit
on
the
number
of
the
carts
for
lucky
dogs
within
125?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
mention
that
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
oral
argument
or
any
agreement
that,
at
that
time
nancy
dukes
was
selling
hotdogs?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
did
the
court
of
appeals
get
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
your
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
mistaken?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
was
obtained
from
your
brief.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
record
does
show
she
sells
something
more
than
hotdogs.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
ordinance
is
not
--
that
was
replaced
by
the
present
ordinance.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
excuse
me.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
kind
of
vendor?s
wagon
did
she
have?
i
do
not
find
any
photographs
of
hers
as
i
do
of
the
others.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
nothing
was
made
out
of
rig
she
was
using.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
they
are
in
the
record,
but
we
have
them
out
here
in
front
of
a
building,
sometimes
it
gets
in
the
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
you
eliminate
them
entirely?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
could
eliminate
them
step
by
step,
could
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we
are
going
to
eventually
phase
out
all
pushcart
dealers.
we
are
going
to
start
with
the
ones
who
have
been
in
business
the
least,
the
shortest
length
of
time,
in
order
to
minimize
the
upset
and,
this
year,
these
people
will
go
out
of
business
and
the
next
year,
some
other
people.
finally,
in
five
years,
everyone
is
going
to
be
out
of
business.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
are
getting
into
a
substantive
argument
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
the
state
could
not
put
you
out
of
business.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
that
she
was
doing
confections,
was
she
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
her
case
any
better
or
worse
whether
she
did
or
did
not
sell
hotdogs?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
far
as
this
ordinance
is
concerned?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
although
she
has
been
eight
years,
a
vendor,
whether
or
not
she
sells
hotdogs.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
then
you
stick
on
compelling
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
go
that
far
and
you
think
you
have
to
go
that
far.
