justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is,
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
dukes
had
gone
into
business
in
the
latin
quarter
at
precisely
the
same
time
that
lucky
dogs
went
into
business
and
that
both
conducted
business
in
substantially
the
same
manner.
would
the
city
council
of
new
orleans
have
had
authority
to
decide
which
one
of
those
two
vendors
should
remain
in
business?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
that
the
grandfather
clause
aspect
of
this
case
really
is
immaterial
to
your
position
in
theory.
