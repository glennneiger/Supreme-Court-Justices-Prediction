mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
issue
presented
by
this
matter
is
one
of
jurisdiction.
we
are
here
before
this
court
today
under
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.
1254
subparagraph
2,
which
comes
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal.
the
original
case
being
heard
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
on
an
attack
upon
one
of
our
city
ordinances
regulating
street
vendors
and
hawkers
in
the
historical
district
known
as
the
vieux
carre
or
french
quarters
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
that
particular
ordinance
holds
and
provides
that
holders
or
permits
not
valid
for
eight
previous
years
may
not
receive
or
apply
for
and
get
another
permit
for
the
coming
year,
what
we
would
commonly
call
a
grandfather
clause.
the
district
court
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
held
in
our
favor.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
after
placing
us
on
their
summary
calendar,
reversed
holding
that
the
ordinance?s
grandfather
clause
was
unconstitutional
as
applied.
we
filed
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
under
1254-2.
now
under
1254-2,
a
municipal
ordinance
that
is
well
established
by
this
time,
it
can
be
considered
as
a
statute
because
1254-2
merely
provides
for
direct
appeal
from
a
court
of
appeals
judgment,
which
holds
a
state
statute
invalid.
the
jurisprudence
over
the
years
has
established
one
other
requirement.
this
requirement
being
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
a
final
judgment,
and
what
is
?final?
has
indeed
been
an
elusive
question
down
through
the
jurisprudence.
most
recently,
after
my
brief
was
filed,
this
court
in
doran
versus
salem
inn,
inc.did
recognize
the
fact
that
this
question
is
indeed
a
hard
question.
all
of
the
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
mainly
cox,
mtm
versus
baxley,
north
dakota
board
versus
snyder
drugs,
and
miami
herald
versus
tornillo
seem
to
distill
it
down
to
one
question,
if
the
court
of
appeals
does
finally
determine
the
constitutional
question
before
it,
and
therefore,
the
question
will
not
survive
the
remand
and
the
remand
has
no
material
effect
on
the
federal
constitutional
issue,
then
for
purposes
of
1254-2,
direct
appeal
to
this
honorable
court
that
is
a
final
judgment.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
we
would
also
submit
that
the
city
of
el
paso
case
would
allow
you
to
treat
this
matter
as
a
matter
on
certiorari
as
well.
but
at
any
rate,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
did
finally
determine
that
the
grandfather
clause
is
unconstitutional
as
it
appears
in
that
particular
city
ordinance.
the
only
thing
left
for
the
district
court
to
decide
is
whether
that
particular
provision
of
the
city
ordinance
is
severable
from
the
ordinance?s
general
preclusion
of
hotdog
pushcart
vendors
in
the
french
quarter.
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
ordinance
does
create
some
form
of
statutory
discrimination
that
is
well
established
and
conceded.
however,
not
all
statutory
discriminations
are
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
this
court
has
taught
in
many,
many
cases.
states
are
afforded
wide
latitude
in
the
area
of
regulation
of
their
streets
under
their
police
power,
and
presumption
of
validity
must
be
presumed
at
the
time
of
the
legislative
enactment.
to
be
unconstitutional,
there
must
be
some
form
of
invidious
discrimination
based
upon
some
totally
arbitrary
ground
which
bears
no
rational
relation
to
the
legitimate
government
and
sought
by
the
legislation.
the
case
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
upon
heavily
in
its
decision
was
morey
versus
doud,
and
morey
versus
doud
which
was
in
1957
sometime
ago
set
forth
four
distinct
requirements
to
be
looked
into
before
a
statute
is
held
unconstitutional.
it
starts
out
by
stating
a
proposition
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
take
from
the
state
the
power
to
classify
in
the
adaption
of
police
laws,
but
admits
of
the
exercise
of
a
wide
scope
of
discretion
in
that
regard
and
avoids
what
is
done
only
when
it
was
without
any
reasonable
basis
and,
therefore,
arbitrary.
the
second
criteria
established
by
morey
is
that
the
classification,
having
some
reasonable
basis,
does
not
offend
against
the
fourteenth
amendment
merely
because
it
is
not
made
with
some
mathematical
nicety
or
because,
in
practice,
it
results
in
some
form
of
inequality.
the
third
criteria
is
that
when
the
classification
in
such
law
is
called
in
question,
if
any
state
of
facts,
and
this
is
important,
can
reasonably
be
conceived
that
would
sustain
it,
the
existence
of
that
state
effects
at
the
time
the
law
was
enacted
must
be
assumed.
the
legislative
body
--
we
are
talking
about
judicial
restraint
at
this
point,
the
legislative
bodies
which
is
the
embodiment
of
the
whole
entire
city
of
new
orleans,
the
council?s
judgment
must
be
presumed
to
have
been
valid
at
the
time
that
the
ordinance
was
enacted.
so,
what
we
come
down
to
actually
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
feel
that
it
has
application
and
that
it
is
the
guiding
principle.
it
sets
forth
very
succinctly
what
the
legion
of
cases
seemed
to
all
be
saying
in
different
ways.
it
sets
out
the
requirements
which
we
must
investigate
and
the
investigation
we
must
proceed
upon
very
succinctly
in
1-2-3-4
terms.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
mentioned
it,
i
believe.
i
did
not
cite
it.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
i
feel
that
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
it
may
have
application
in
the
area
of
the
equal
protection
argument,
and
i
feel
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
rightly
so
looked
at
those
requirements
as
expressed
in
morey
versus
doud,
but
their
interpretation
of
it
strongly
differs
from
ours.
what
we
must
do,
therefore,
in
the
area
of
equal
protection
arguments
is
weigh
the
society?s
interests,
and
the
society
is
you
and
we
and
everyone
else,
against
the
particular
individual?s
interest
to
see
if
the
societal
interest
is
compelling,
and
this
is
important
again
and,
therefore,
predominant
over
the
individual?s
rights
and
privileges.
if
the
state?s
interest
is
compelling,
then
the
legislation
will
and
must
be
upheld.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
the
mcgowan
test
mr.
chief
justice;
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
should
control.
as
far
as
our
argument
is
concerned,
we
hope
it
controls,
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
you
pointed
out,
economic
legislation,
which
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
we
have
a
french
quarter
of
new
orleans
and
we
have
an
area
that
must
be
regulated
in
some
way,
shape,
or
form
and
the
way
that
it
is
chosen
to
be
regulated
definitely
deals
upon
economics
and
finance.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
that
is
what
it
boils
down
to,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
is
correct.
and
as
far
as
--
if
i
may
return
for
just
a
second
to
answer
mr.
justice
rehnquist?s
question
on
the
economic
legislation,
we
do
have
economic
legislation
here.
we
do
not
have
individual
fundamental
rights
per
se
in
question.
the
levy
versus
louisiana,
palmer
versus
thompson,
san
antonio
school
district
versus
rodriguez,
and
legions
of
cases
all
held
that
there
are
no
constitutional
guarantees
and
rights
to
financial
and
economic
equality,
only
that
all
persons
similarly
circumstanced
be
treated
alike.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
lucky
dogs,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
22
years.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
no,
sir,
that
is
not
correct.
this
particular
appellee
is
not
a
competitor
of
lucky
dogs.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
it
has
been
doing
business
for
about
two
years,
but
if
you
would
look
at
volume
1
of
the
appendix,
page
80
and
81,
which
is
all
the
district
court
had
before
it
when
it
decided
and
the
fifth
circuit
had
before
it
as
well.
this
is
the
entire
record.
the
sworn
affidavit,
sworn
affidavit
of
mrs.
dukes
and
her
only
employee,
mr.
frank
b.
silliker,
state
that
their
only
business,
and
i
go
to
the
middle
of
the
first
paragraph
of
mr.
silliker?s
affidavit
on
page
80,
their
only
business,
which
business
consists
of
selling
drinks,
confections,
and
novelties.
it
does
not
mention
hotdogs.
it
mentions
cold
drinks,
confections,
meaning,
i
would
imagine,
candy,
and
novelties
such
as,
i
guess,
stuffed
animals,
horns
with
buttons,
whatever.
it
does
not
mention
hotdogs
and
that
is
significant
because
in
the
french
quarter
of
new
orleans,
over
so
many
years,
the
hotdog
peddler,
peddlers,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
have
been
distilled
out
to
this
one
company
and
i
would
say
that
the
factual
determination
contained
in
these
affidavits
certainly
would
not
put
mrs.
dukes
and
mr.
silliker
on
the
same
footing
or
on
the
same
class
as
lucky
dogs.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct
and
it
is
the
fifth
circuit
in
their
decision
at
footnote
--
on
page
709
footnote
2,
the
fifth
circuit
itself
says
that
?dukes
appears
no
longer
seriously
to
press
for
an
original
attack
on
discrimination
between
vendors
of
different
types
of
goods.
in
any
case,
we
have
no
difficulty
in
concluding
that
such
an
equal
protection
claim
on
dukes?
part
could
not
withstand
analysis.?
and
they
cite
mcgowan,
and
this
is
all
we
are
saying
in
the
instant
matter
that
mrs.
dukes
is
not
within
the
same
protective
class.
she
is
not
similarly
circumstanced
as
one
of
the
only
two
people
who
do
qualify
under
the
ordinance
of
grandfather
clause.
now,
the
economic
legislation
argument
is
important.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
feel,
was
designed
to
protect
those
fundamental
and
personal
rights
and
not
economic
interests
and
privileges.
the
reason
behind
this
statute
or
any
other
statue
must
deal
with
the
policy
of
the
government
and,
with
this
in
mind,
the
weighing
test,
which
i
have
stated
before,
let
us
see
what
interest
the
city
of
new
orleans
has
in
this
legislation
and
if
that
interest
is
indeed
compelling
enough
to
overcome
the
incidental
discrimination
which
is
imposed.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
no,
sir,
there
is
not
as
long
as
the
interest
of
the
council
was
rationally
guided
and
it,
thus,
further
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well
i
would
submit,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
you
pointed
out,
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
judiciary
to
determine
that.
i
listened
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct,
but
i
believe
that
morey
versus
doud
stated
that
that
type
of
unregulated
monopoly
could
not
withstand
it.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
and
lucky
dogs
is
absolutely
not
mentioned
in
that
ordinance
and
there
is
a
very
good
reason
for
that
because
of
the
fact
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
yes,
sir,
there
is
one
other
person.
his
name
is
--
his
name
escapes
me,
but
it
is
an
ice
cream
vendor
in
the
jackson
square
area
who
had
been
there
for
some
20,
some
odd
years.
he
was
the
only
other
person
which
was
saved
by
the
ordinance,
and
i--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
overall
scheme,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct,
except
there
is
a
general
preclusion
of
all
vendors
in
the
french
quarter
except
certain
classes
of
vendors
as
the
ordinance
so
states.
i
will
admit
that
the
ordinance
may
be
inartfully
drawn
but
not
so
inartfully
drawn
as
to
render
it
unconstitutional.
certainly,
there
are
certain
vendors,
i
believe,
provided
for
in
the
ordinance
of
other
than
hotdogs
and
hotdogs,
actually,
is
not
provided
in
the
ordinance,
and
i
think
you
have
to
read
both
closes
at
the
same
paragraph
of
the
ordinance
to
show,
just
as
you
stated,
that
if
you
have
been
there
for
more
than
eight
years
you
cannot
steady.
if
you
have
not,
you
will
not
be
allowed
in
that
area,
and
now
the
central
business
district
which
encompasses
the
french
quarter
as
well.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
as
far
as
i
know,
she
does
not.
i
do
not
know.
confections
may
be
ice
cream.
it
depends
upon
your
interpretation.
factually,
i
do
not
know.
at
any
rate,
the
weighing
process
must
be
had
here
and,
as
i
started
to
point
out
before
when
the
city
council
passed
this
ordinance,
we
must
under
morey
versus
doud
as
it
teaches
us,
we
must
presume
that
their
rationale
was
valid
and
invoke
that
presumption
at
the
time
the
ordinance
was
passed.
the
reason
behind
the
ordinance
is
very
clear;
it
is
crystal
clear
really.
the
historic
district
or
the
french
quarter
is
the
oldest
historic
district
continually
in
existence
that
i
am
able
to
discover
in
this
country.
it
is
260
years
old.
it
has
been
the
same
since
its
beginning.
it
has
not
changed
appreciably
other
than
i
would
imagine
paving
of
streets
etcetera,
but
it
has
not
changed
appreciably,
and
it
is
the
quaint
unique
very
delicate
mixture
of
both
residential
and
economic
interests
in
that
area
which
make
it
the
heart
of
the
city.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
louisiana
provides
for
the
establishment
of
vieux
carre
commission,
which
governs
the
exterior
of
all
buildings,
streets,
etcetera
in
that
french
quarter
and
you
cannot
change
it
by
law.
it
is
that
important.
it
is
the
heart;
the
economic
heartthrob
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
is
the
french
quarter.
the
whole
city
surrounds
the
french
quarter.
hotel
and
motel
construction
in
the
french
quarter
is
a
good
indication
of
real
estate
values
and
is
a
good
indication
of
the
economic
conditions
and
important
contribution.
this
area
makes
to
the
city
of
new
orleans
tax
base.
the
areas
close
to
the
city?s
employment
and
entertainment
centers
as
well
and
many
small
businesses
are
established
there
to
cater
to
the
needs
of
local
residents
who
live
there
as
well
as
the
tourist
who
flow
there
and
citizen
alike
by
the
thousands
daily.
so,
we
have
a
fairly
unique
situation
as
much
you
can
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
to
the
georgetown
area
of
washington
and
what
it
does
for
the
city
of
washington
d.c.
and,
the
single
most
important
factor
in
the
french
quarter?s
economy
is
its
retailing.
a
large
number
of
the
mini
antique
shops,
gift
stores,
theaters,
restaurants,
nationally
famous
bars,
restaurants,
etcetera
are
centered
here.
and,
support
for
these
establishes
comes
mainly
from
tourists
and
citizens
who
are
charmed
by
this
historic
district.
so,
we
are
talking
about
not
only
favoring
someone
over
someone
else;
we
are
talking
about
national
historic
preservation,
and
we
have
a
vested
interest
in
this
national
historic
preservation.
if
that
is
not
a
valid
and
compelling
interest,
we
do
not
know
what
is
and
when
the
fifth
circuit
declined
to
even
balance
the
test
and
said
it
is
enough
that
the
constitutional
infirmities
that
they
saw
overcame
any
balancing
necessary.
i
believe
they
erred
gravely,
because
this
area
is
the
most
important
area
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
the
city
definitely,
therefore,
has
a
valid
propelling
interest
in
maintaining
the
french
quarter?s
physical,
social,
and
economic
potential.
preservation
and
protection
to
be
of
any
significance
at
all
must
encompass
both
the
physical
and
functional
elements
of
the
french
quarter
that
contribute
to
its
identity
and
environmental
unity.
you
cannot
just
say
like,
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
you
pointed
out,
we
will
let
the
buildings
stay
the
same
and
leave
everything
else
unregulated,
because
if
you
did
that
then
people
would
probably
come
there,
both
citizen
and
tourist
alike,
and
say,
?well,
the
building
sure
are
pretty,
but
i
am
being
troubled
and
hustled
and
jostled
on
the
street
by
so
many
street
peddlers
or
whatever,?
that
they
would
not
come
back.
and,
it
would
begin
to
deteriorate.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
this
is
the
crux
of
our
problem,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
as
i
would
state,
that
it
may
well
be
in
the
regulatory
scheme
of
things
that
after
lucky
dogs
and
this
other
fellow
failed
to
qualify,
go
out
of
business
or
whatever,
there
will
be
no
peddlers
in
the
french
quarter
on
the
streets,
which
we
maintain
we
can
constitutionally
regulate.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
believe
they
have
about
17
or
18.
they
definitely
have
more
than
one.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
yes,
sir,
it
is
a
corporation.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
it
has
been
there
22
years
and
you
are
correct
when
you
say
it
may
be
a
legislative
monopoly
in
so
far
as
hotdog
peddlers
are
concerned.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
he
may
be
out
of
business.
he
is
an
individual
in
the
jackson
square
area
who
sells
ice
cream,
very
colorful
individual
inside.
people
seek
him
out
to
photograph,
etcetera.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
no,
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
is
no
limit.
again,
this
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
seemed
to
be
saying
when
they
talked
about
--
excuse
me
--
in
their
decision
that
the
city
may
well
regulate
in
another
way
than
that
which
was
accomplished,
such
as
limiting
the
number,
the
size,
the
way
they
looked,
etcetera,
but,
this
is
the
judicial
legislation
and
we
feel
strongly
that
the
presumption
of
the
city
council
must
override
that
judicial
legislation,
and
judicial
restraint
should
be
practiced
in
this
particular
matter.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
mr.
justice
powell,
under
this
ordinance
obviously
it
would
make
no
difference,
but
under
the
hypothetical
--
i
think,
possibly
under
the
ladue
decision
if
it
was,
and
in
the
decisions
that
float
from
the
laude,
if
it
was
determined
in
the
legislative
body?s
wisdom
that
the
maintenance
of
one
individual
over
another
would
further
the
industry
and
that
the
competition
would
kill
the
industry,
then
i
believe
that
that
was
a
legitimate
and
valid
and
rationally
guided
decision,
and
it
certainly
would
be
within
their
power
under
those
cases
to
favor
one
over
the
other.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here
but,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
believe
we
could
validly
enact
such
type
of
legislation.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
in
theory,
it
is.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
la
ladue.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
it
is
ladue
local
lines
versus
bi-state
and
nebbia
versus
new
york
are
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
simply
stated,
therefore,
when
a
weighing
process
is
involved
affecting
the
long
range
economic
welfare
of
an
entire
city
and
in
the
shape
of
the
nation
cities
are
in
today,
we
will
all
recognize
that
we
must
give
some
form
of
judicial
recognition
to
the
legislature?s
wisdom
in
this
area,
because
cities
today
are
in
bad
financial
shape.
and
so,
we
must
weigh
the
city?s
interest
as
opposed
to
the
short
range
desires
of
one
individual
and,
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
city
council
which
is
the
representative
of
the
people
must,
in
this
matter,
be
given
wide
latitude
and
liberal
construction
unless
it
is
patently
offensive
to
the
notions
of
equal
protection
and
fair
play
which,
we
submit,
it
is
not.
i
would
reserve
any
further
time
i
have
for
rebuttal
if
necessary.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
lunch
and
break,
the
question
was
put
to
me
or
to
mr.
marcal,
i
cannot
remember
exactly
which
one
of
us,
as
to
why
or
was
it
pointed
out
to
the
fifth
circuit
that
lucky
dogs,
that
nancy
dukes
was
not
a
hotdog
salesman.
i
would
draw
your
attention
to
volume
2
of
our
appendix
at
page
16
which
is
a
reproduction
of
my
brief
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
bottom
paragraph
does
so
point
out
the
fact
that
nancy
dukes
was
not
a
hotdog
peddler
in
the
french
quarter.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
confections.
and,
it
was
our
understanding
at
the
time
of
the
attack
originally,
when
it
was
brought
in
1972,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
was
that
this
was
an
attack
by
a
vendor
of
different
forms
or
different
types
of
foodstuffs
or
different
types
of
things.
she
made
the
contention
orally
that
she
was
going
to
sell
sandwiches,
etcetera,
and
nothing
about
hotdogs,
and
we
are
talking
about
semantics
but
nothing
particularly
about
hotdogs
per
se
and
i
think
we
can
see
by
the
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
believe
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
believe,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
may
be
in
this
respect,
because
we
maintain
that
she
is
not
within
that
protected
class
that
she
claim
she
carries
the
banner
for,
a
hotdog
salesman.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
it
depends.
as
it
stands
today,
maybe
it
does
in
the
certain
respect,
but
she
claims
to
be
within
a
class
of
people
who
was
favored
because
they
were
there
eight
years,
and
she
has
only
been
there
two
and,
therefore,
she
says
she
is
discriminated
against.
this
is
where
the
fifth
circuit
started,
in
the
very
first
sentence
of
its
opinion,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
under
the
faulty
premise
that
she
was
one
hotdog
vendor
and
then
it
goes
on
in
the
same
paragraph
and
the
next
paragraph
to
state
that
lucky
dogs
--
it
implies
that
lucky
dogs
had
been
there
only
eight
years.
and,
these
two
factors
combined
must
be
the
reason
that
the
city
council
sought
to
favor
the
one
over
the
other
when,
in
fact,
the
facts
do
belie
that.
the
facts
are
strong,
in
her
own
sworn
affidavit,
she
sells
confections,
novelties,
and
cold
drinks.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
in
her
affidavit,
she
does
not
say
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct
because
the
contention
she
made
to
the
district
court
by
her
counsel,
which
i
was
compelled
to
answer,
was
that
she
wanted
to
go
there
and
sell.
she
did
not
vend.
this
was
the
reason
that
her
vendor
was
arrested,
because
the
hotdog
was
accepted
and
he
was
not
selling
hotdogs.
at
that
particular
time,
there
was
no
eight-year
--
hotdogs
were
accepted,
they
could
be
in
there
and
there
was
no
eight-year
grandfather
clause.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
believe
the
overall
regulatory
scheme
shall
be,
in
the
future
years,
to
eliminate
all
transient
vendors,
street
peddlers,
and
hawkers.
and,
this
is
one
of
the
steps
in
that
scheme.
but
there
is
no
restriction
on
the
number
that
lucky
dogs
can
have,
is
there?
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
there
is
no
restriction
at
the
present
time.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
that
is
correct.
however,
i
would
respectfully
point
out
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
do
not
believe
they
could
under
the
ordinance
as
it
now
stands.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
because,
i
think,
the
policy
behind
the
ordinance
is
clear.
i
think
it
is
seeking
to
regulate
vendors
and
eventually
eliminate
all
of
them.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
as
it
is
written,
you
may
be
correct.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
as
far
as
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
maybe
under
the
ordinance
as
it
stands,
but
--
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
that
is
correct
but
we
also
have
to
look
at
the
intention
of
the
city
council
as
well.
now,
since
this
suit
has
been
filed
in
1972,
lucky
dogs
has
not
done
any
of
the
things
that
you
have
suggested
that
it
might
under
the
ordinance,
okay?
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
well,
that
may
be
because
the
case
is
in
court
and
it
may
not
be
because
they
were
under
no
restraint.
at
any
rate,
when
his
client
was
arrested,
he
was
not
selling
hotdogs
which
is
the
only
thing
he
could
sell
and,
therefore,
he
was
arrested.
the
court
of
appeals?
opinion,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
begins
from
the
two
faulty
premises
and
flows
there
from
the
entire
tenor
of
the
opinion
except
for
those
couple
of
paragraphs.
and,
the
question
of
grandfather
clause
is,
in
this
case,
illustrative
of
the
desire
not
to
favor
any
particular
business
but
to
maintain
only
those
features
which,
over
the
years,
have
become
landmarks
in
the
area
of
the
city
of
new
orleans,
over
260
years,
not
to
suggest
that
lucky
dogs
has
been
there
that
long,
but
all
of
the
features,
that
some
total
of
the
functional
and
physical
part
of
the
french
quarter.
it
is
this
entire
area
of
the
city
which
is
intentionally
preserved
and
not
individual
establishments,
and
such
intent
must,
must
be
viewed
in
its
entirety
and
not
as
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did,
dissected
into
each
of
its
incidental
side
efforts.
therefore,
we
urge
this
honorable
court
to
consider
such
action
on
the
part
of
the
city
that
it
is
representing
a
legitimate
and
compelling
governmental
interest
and
the
presumption,
therefore,
should
be
applied
as
the
case
law
states.
and
judicial
restraint,
which
is
exactly
the
point
as
well,
should
be
invoked
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
should
be
overturned
and
the
district
court?s
opinion
reinstated.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
would
stress
compelling
interest.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
joel
p.
loeffelholz
i
believe
that,
in
this
court,
we
must
go
that
far.
thank
you.
