all
right,
thank
you.

your
brother
on
the
other
side
has
pointed
to
an
affidavit
in
this
record
indicating
that
your
client
was
not
in
direct
competition
of
lucky
dogs,
that
her
pushcarts
indeed
did
not
sell
hotdogs.
justice

that
is
what
the
record
shows.
justice

therefore,
so
far
as
judge
goldberg?s
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
states,
and
it
does
state
in
the
first
sentence
that
your
client
maintained
a
pushcart
business
in
the
vieux
carre
of
new
orleans
selling
hotdogs,
drinks,
confections,
and
novelties.
he
has
simply
mistaken
so
far
as
the
record
goes,
when
it
says
hotdogs,
has
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
in
the
record
does
it
show?
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
part
of
the
record
to
which,
bearing
on
this,
to
which
we
have
been
directed
is
the
affidavit
to
which
your
brother
directed
us.
now,
if
there
anything
else
in
the
record
indicating
otherwise,
please,
i
would
be
interested
in
knowing.

you
will
have
opportunity
at

justice

well,
i
have
in
mind
counsel
the
very
first
proposition
stated
in
nebbia
against
new
york
leading
case
cited
by
your
brother
states
no
more
than
a
well-established
law
in
any
area.
i
read
it
as
a
basis
for
attacking
a
discriminatory
regulation.
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
party
complaining
must
show
that
he
himself
is
adversely
affected
by
it.
now
perhaps,
as
