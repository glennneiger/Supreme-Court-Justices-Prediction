justice
stewart
your
brother
cited
to
us
a
couple
of
cases
which
he
says
are
cases
of
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
i
think,
one
in
238
us
and
another
in
192
us,
in
which
he
says
the
court
has
entered
money
judgments
against
the
state,
but
i
suppose
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
the
state
suing
on
its
own
behalf
and
not
on
behalf
of
its
citizens.
justice
stewart
that
is
in
238
us,
is
it?
