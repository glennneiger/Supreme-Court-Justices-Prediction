justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
sure
it
would
be
that.
i
admit
that
they
would
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
justice
white
that
the
money
would
never
end
up
in
their
pocket.
it
would
either
end
up
in
new
jersey’s
or
pennsylvania’s
pockets.
justice
white
you
do
not
pay
the
tax
to
one
or
the
other
jurisdiction.
justice
white
at
any
event,
even
if
you
cannot
get
the
money
you
want
to
stay
in
court
and
have
the
law
invalidated.
justice
white
but
nevertheless,
the
claim
here
is
that
the
constitution
prevents
new
jersey
from
imposing
the
tax
in
this
case.
justice
white
suppose
that
we
had
granted
originally
the
motion
for
leave
to
file,
could
you
not
be
making
much
the
same
argument
to
support
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
if
you
had
made
one?
justice
white
no,
just
for
judgment
in
your
favor
on
the
grounds
that
maybe
they
have
got
standing
but
they
are
just
not
entitled
to
the
judgment.
justice
white
that
it
is
a
cause
of
action.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
if
your
paper,
whatever
you
filed,
you
would
not
objectively
construe
to
include
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
it
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
really.
justice
white
you
have
not
filed
an
answer.
justice
white
because
there
has
not
been
a
complaint
file.
justice
white
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
area
in
the
between
denying
motion
for
leave
to
file
and
a
full
blown
trial
of
the
merits.
do
you
think
there
is
any
room
for
holding
that
they
have
never
seen
a
cause
of
action?
justice
white
to
dismiss
the
case?
justice
white
you
might
file
an
answer
and
that
is
the
decision
of
the
court.
justice
white
i
do
not
suppose
you
can
say
what
new
jersey
would
do
if
pennsylvania
decided
that
it
would
not
give
a
credit.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
could
say
there
is
one
thing
it
would
not
do,
and
that
is
to
tax
everybody
or
would
a
possibility?
you
would
just
quit
exempting
new
jersey-ites
so
that
pennsylvania
would
then
give
the
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
need
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
need
an
injunction
to
force
new
hampshire
not
to
enforce
its
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
far
as
the
future
is
concerned
the
harm
to
maine
will
not
occur
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
case
under
new
hampshire
statute
if
maine
did
not
give
a
credit
for
the
new
hampshire
tax?
would
under
your
present
law
you
continue
to
collect
the
ax
from
people
working
in
new
hampshire,
but
who
are
residents
of
maine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
do
not
know
(voice
overlap).
that
is
not
my
question.
under
the
law
as
it
was
written,
would
have
--
it
had
been
collected?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
it
may
be
that
--
it
may
be
that
if
maine
eliminated
the
credit
maybe
new
hampshire
would
change
its
law,
but
under
the
law
as
it
was
written,
the
tax
would
still
be
payable?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
have
done
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
repealing
the
credit
would
not
have
knocked
the
new
hampshire
tax
into
a
cold
tab
(ph)?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
as
far
as
new
hampshire
that
you
are
just
saying
it
would
have
been
declared
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
new
hampshire
did
not
recognize
that
fact
by
any
provision
in
this
law
that
said
that
their
tax
is
contingent
upon
another
state
granting
a
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
say
that
double
taxation
is
perfectly
illegal
and
then
say
that
if
maine
had
repealed
its
credit
in
1970
it
would
have
blown
your
tax
out
of
the
water
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
do
not
know
that
--
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
new
hampshire
will
certainly
be
entitled
the
tax
income
earned
in
--
within
the
state
even
if
maine
tax
it
also?
that
is
what
--
