mr.
benson
d.
scotch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
come
here
to
talk
about
the
seriousness
and
the
dignity
of
the
complaint
of
the
three
plaintiff
states
against
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
i
originally
had
planned
before
hearing
the
earlier
argument
to
dwell
principally
on
the
question
of
retroactivity,
for
i
think
no
other
question
raises
the
equities
between
the
plaintiff
states
and
new
hampshire
better
than
the
question
of
retroactivity.
in
approaching
this
particular
equities
question,
it
seems
to
be
we
fall
back
immediately
on
this
court's
own
declarations
in
retroactivity
cases.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
at
the
time
new
hampshire
adapted
its
commuter's
income
tax
case,
tax,
ward
against
maryland
had
been
decided
by
some
90
years
previous.
some
56
years
ago
in
this
very
room,
travis
was
argued.
since
that
time
-
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
in
this
building,
your
honor.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
the
point
is
that
as
far
as
the
[laughter]
as
far
as
the
case
is
concerned,
certainly
new
hampshire
knew
what
they
were
doing.
the
books
have
not
changed,
the
buildings
may
have.
there
has
been
virtually
nothing
since
travis
and
the
date
of
the
adoption
of
the
commuter's
income
tax,
that
would
have
given
any
suggestion
to
new
hampshire
that
that
tax
could
have
have
been
constitutional.
i
think
this
is
very
vital.
in
the
second
lemon
against
kutrzman
case,
this
court
raised
the
question
of
whether
decisions
of
the
court
that
are
first
impression
that
declare
new
principles
of
laws
should
be
retroactively
applied.
i
submit
that
at
the
time
the
commuter's
income
tax
was
adapted
certainly
no
case
of
first
impression
or
any
impression
had
been
decided
by
this
court
or
even
submitted
to
this
court
that
would
have
given
them
any
comfort
in
the
adaption
of
their
commuter's
income
tax
case.
very
important
in
the
question
of
retroactivity
and
in
the
question
of
equities
is
the
subject
of
reliance.
i
think
it
is
inherent
in
the
number
of
the
questions
that
the
justices
have
presented
both
in
the
earlier
argument
and
this
argument.
in
the
normal
reliance
situation,
when
in
lemon
against
kutrzman
in
the
second
decision,
the
court
speaks
of
the
hard
facts
upon
which
people
rely.
people
must
rely,
making
their
decisions.
obviously
the
court
is
speaking
of
two
classes
of
people.
one
class
is
the
law
giver,
the
other
class
is
the
reliance’s
interest
and
in
each
of
the
cases
that
the
court
has
decided
in
the
retroactivity
area,
there
has
been
a
separation
or
bifurcation
of
the
law
giving
interest,
either
the
legislators
and
the
courts
on
the
one
hand
and
upon
those
who
are
rely
on
the
other
hand,
thus
for
example
in
lemon
against
kutrzman,
it
was
the
non-public
schools
that
were
reliance
interest.
certainly
they
did
not
create
the
laws
in
which
they
had
to
make
their
decisions.
same
thing
in
chevron
(ph)
against
houston
or
in
the
frequent
criminal
retroactivity
cases
that
come
before
this
court,
most
recently
in
the
peltier
case,
obviously
the
considerations
that
apply
were
those
who
are
forced
to
rely
to
make
their
day-to-day
judgments,
cannot
make
them
on
the
basis
of
shaping
their
own
law,
they
are
put
in
a
bind.
essentially,
the
retroactivity
cases
in
my
way
of
thinking,
allocated,
divide
among
two
interest
parties,
both
of
which
are
essentially
innocent
insofar
as
being
able
to
frame
and
shape
the
law.
in
the
case
of
new
hampshire
adapting
a
commuter's
income
tax
case,
we
have
a
very,
very
different
situation.
as
will
appear
in
the
record
and
i
would
not
repeat
what
is
already
in
the
record,
at
the
time
and
prior
to
the
time
that
new
hampshire
adapted
this
tax,
they
were
very
on
very
good
notice
from
task
force
prepared
for
the
governor
that
they
were
grave
questions
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
commuter's
income
tax
case.
mr.
hemp's
(ph)
opinion
which
is
also
in
the
record,
points
out
how
cleverly
the
bill
was
drafted.
it
separates
those
who
might
complain,
but
will
be
unable
to
complain
because
they
have
no
standing
from
those
who
are
the
real
targets,
namely
the
states.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
it
appears
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
that
if
the
three
surrounding
states
did
not
have
tax
credits,
the
commuter's
income
tax
of
new
hampshire
never
would
have
been
adapted.
the
most
important
retroactivity-equities
question
that
i
think
the
court
ought
to
consider
and
that
i
want
to
address
is
the
preposition
raised
by
this
court
in
linkletter.
will
the
rule
whose
retroactive
application
is
sought
tend
to
further
or
retard
the
effectiveness
of
the
rule
and
i
would
submit
in
this
case,
the
court
essentially
is
balancing
the
legitimate
interest
and
we
conceive
they
are
legitimate
interests
on
the
part
of
the
states
to
experiment
with
new
types
taxation
that
fit
new
social
and
political
and
economic
conditions
within
the
country.
balance
that
interest
on
the
one
hand
with
what
i
think
is
an
equally
serious
interest
to
deter
what
we
refer
to
in
our
brief
is
taxable
predatory
taxation
or
tax
adventurism
or
the
like.
it
is
very,
very
important
we
feel
to
consider
those
interests
as
being
very
equal
interest,
to
try
to
develop
policies
that
will
mediate
between
those
interests.
i
would
submit
that
if
a
state
acts
with
full
knowledge
of
the
consequences
and
with
full
knowledge
of
the
potential
impediments
in
a
statute
and
if
that
state
later
is
not
compelled
to
face
the
consequences
of
what
it
has
done,
then
i
would
see
no
reason
why
any
state
should
not
adapt
borderline
legislation
or
perhaps
legislation
that
goes
well
over
the
border.
there
are
no
sanctions.
it
takes
three
or
possibly
five
years
for
these
cases
to
wind
their
way
though
the
courts.
there
would
be
no
sanction
or
whatsoever.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
no,
your
honor.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
in
our
case,
it
is
distinguished
from
the
previous
case
to
be
heard
today,
your
honor.
this
tax
already
has
been
declared
invalid
by
this
court.
this
is
not
the
situation
that
i
think
pennsylvania
point
they
allude
to,
their
argument
try
to
suggest
would
develop,
if
the
court
took
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
it
is
not
a
very
common
situation
where
a
legislative
history
has
developed,
reflecting
a
direct
intent
to
act
against
the
treasury
of
a
sister
state
and
where
indeed
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
unless
the
tax
laws
of
the
second
state
were
not
susceptible
to
this
treatment,
the
tax
would
not
be
adapted
at
all.
i
think
this
would
not
be
a
large
case
finding
decision
in
that
sense.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
i
would
simply
urge,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
the
case
of
the
three
plaintiff
states
here
represented,
we
did
not
come
directly
to
the
court.
we
bided
our
time
in
austin
against
new
hampshire
and
it
was
a
long
time
and
costly
time.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
we
appeared
as
an
--
as
an
amicus
curiae
and
yes
we
did,
we
participated
directly.
we
felt
that
was
the
proper
route
to
go,
not
alone
in
terms
of
the
limited
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
but
in
terms
of
giving
new
hampshire
the
opportunity
through
their
court
system
or
through
their
legislators
to
recant
and
they
did
not
do
so.
we
feel
at
this
point
that
the
tax
having
been
declared
unconstitutional,
this
is
not
a
case
finding
decision.
this
is
a
very
unusual
set
of
circumstances
and
we
feel
that
we
have
gone
to
court
in
the
right
order,
starting
with
the
state
where
we
ought
to
have
started
and
in
that
sense
it
is
not
comparable
at
all
to
the
condition
of
the
suit
by
pennsylvania
against
new
jersey.
not
to
cast
any
suggestion
about
the
merits
of
their
original
action,
but
we
felt
differently
at
the
time
and
we
so
conducted
ourselves.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
a
point
that
has
been
raised
in
several
connections
by
the
justices
and
that
is
what
i
call
“the
so-called
litigation
question.”
why
should
not
the
states
repeal
their
credits?
i
wanna
draw
a
clear
distinction
between
cases
like
massachusetts
against
missouri
or
texas
against
florida,
where
we
are
dealing
with
death
taxes.
the
income
tax
credit
is
not
only
a
fact
of
life
today,
virtually
throughout
the
country,
but
in
this
particular
instance
our
failure
to
grant
the
credit
would
have
meant
effective
double
taxation
to
our
own
citizens
and
i
would
simply
urge
that
in
economic
realities
of
an
income
tax,
particularly
in
today’s
economic
conditions
where
wages
in
our
particular
part
of
the
country
are
not
high,
doubling
the
income
tax
of
our
own
citizens
in
order
to
re-dress
the
wrong
committed
by
new
hampshire
did
not
come
to
us
as
a
really
viable
alternative.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
i
believe
they
have
a
credit
for
their
own
citizens,
but
i
believe
the
outcome
is
as
conceded
earlier
in
arguments
where
new
hampshire
--
where
--
i
am
sorry,
where
pennsylvania
made
reference
to
the
possible
double
taxation
suggests
and
together
with
new
hampshire’s
own
brief
in
this
matter
suggest
that
there
would
be
no
falling
away
of
the
new
hampshire
tax
in
the
event
that
we
dropped
our
credits.
all
that
would
fall
away
is
that
entirely
hypothetical
tax
that
was
imposed
upon
citizens
of
new
hampshire
who
worked
in
vermont
and
the
other
two
states,
that
never
could
be
applied
because
of
the
way
it
was
drafted.
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
our
dropping
of
our
tax
credit
would
directly
involve
double
taxation
unless
of
course
as
suggested
by
the
court
in
the
oral
argument,
unless
of
course
new
hampshire
chose
at
that
point
to
drop
it
is
commuter's
income
tax,
that
is
a
completely
speculative
matter.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
no,
your
honor.
even
in
the
area
of
death
taxes,
we
found
out
in
texas
against
florida,
where
the
viable
claims
are
mutually
exclusive,
this
court
will
take
jurisdiction.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
-
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
that
is
right.
they
were
mutually
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
what
i
am
suggesting
in
answer
to
the
argument
volenti
non
fit
injuria,
is
that
we
as
a
state
need
to
consider
the
injuria,
what
or
what
kind
of
injury
are
we
visiting
upon
our
citizens.
must
we
be
compelled
to
take
the
corrective
steps,
where
there
has
been
harm,
deliberate
harm
as
will
appear
on
the
statutory
history
of
this
act,
i
think
talking
of
old
common
law
doctrine,
that
it
was
clear
common
law
doctrine,
that
mitigation
of
damages
need
not
be
taken
where
the
mitigation
itself
would
be
unreasonable
or
would
cause
undue
harm
to
others.
in
fact,
i
think
our
old
common
law
case
is
going
back
to
the
17th
century
make
clear
the
right
for
example,
of
the
lord
of
the
matter,
the
defendant
servant,
i
would
suggest
an
equal
preposition
in
our
case
that
the
states
have
not
only
the
right
to
defend
their
citizens
and
the
ability
of
the
citizens
to
continue
to
work,
but
probably
a
duty
to
do
so,
i
would
submit
it
would
have
been
a
number
of
years
before
new
hampshire
could
have
practically
considered
the
repeal
of
its
commuter's
income
tax.
talking
of
our
own
proprietary
interest,
i
think
it
would
be
demonstrable
from
masters
appointed
in
this
case
to
show
that
the
incomes
of
many
of
our
commuters
are
at
such
a
level
that
the
doubling
of
their
income
taxation
would
make
it
economically
inconsequential
for
them
to
continue
working.
many
of
our
people
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
well,
that
is
what
we
are
--
i
believe
and
of
course
this
is
a
matter
we
can
submit
further,
written
document,
i
believe
the
tax
is
written
in
such
a
way
that
the
benefit
of
our
--
the
benefits
uphold
of
our
dropping
of
our
credit,
our
credit
would
not
accrue
to
our
own
citizens.
well,
that
is
a
technical
matter.
i
believe
we
are
right
on
it
and
we
will
leave
it
to
new
hampshire,
perhaps
to
declare
whether
that
is
correct
or
not.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
well,
we
--
we
in
vermont
of
course
have
our
own
very
strong
views
on
new
hampshire
(voice
overlap)
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
i
would
like
finally
if
i
may
to
address
a
remark
or
two
about
massachusetts
against
missouri.
i
find
there
is
a
very
expanse
if
it
not
a
profligate
reliance
upon
massachusetts
against
missouri.
that
was
a
very
simple
case
as
i
read
the
case.
all
the
court
is
saying
in
massachusetts
against
missouri
is
that
massachusetts
has
not
stated
a
cause
of
action.
this
was
a
case
of
rival,
but
mutually,
allegedly
mutually
exclusive
claims.
now,
it
turned
out
not
to
be
mutually
exclusive.
there
was
no
allegation
in
massachusetts'
papers
in
massachusetts
against
missouri,
that
the
missouri
tax
was
discriminatory
or
that
in
any
way
the
tax
violated
any
precepts
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
their
papers
before
this
court.
in
fact,
the
sole
allegation
that
attorney
general
deaver
(ph)
really
is
able
to
level
in
massachusetts
against
missouri
that
the
courts
of
missouri
will
not
hear
massachusetts’
claim
against
the
trustees
of
trust.
the
attorney
general
of
missouri
was
able
to
give
that
vitali
by
stating
in
open
court
that
of
course
the
courts
of
missouri
would
hear
a
claim
by
massachusetts
against
the
trustees
and
that
is
all
that
massachusetts
against
missouri
decides.
we
are
not
claiming
mutual
exclusivity.
we
are
claiming
in
effect
a
direct
harm
to
the
interest
of
our
state,
a
calculated
harm
and
if
you
will,
harm
that
in
terms
in
common
law
analogies,
it
is
very
similar
to
a
direct
common
law
tort,
although
we
have
not
so
alleged
and
perhaps
that
states
the
case
a
little
strongly.
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
find
in
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
against
missouri
that
would
lend
to
the
general
preposition
that
tax
cases
that
are
otherwise
justiciable
may
not
come
before
this
court
in
original
jurisdiction.
it
seems
to
me,
if
we
make
out
a
claim
that
the
three
plaintiff
states
were
in
fact
the
targets,
perhaps
some
of
this
questions
go
to
fact
finding
that
could
occur
after
a
master
is
appointed,
but
we
feel,
frankly
they
are
adequately
stated
on
the
record
submitted
with
our
papers.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
on
that
type
of
theory
and
not
a
mutually
exclusive
theory,
there
is
no
reason
why
this
court,
what
not
to
on
general
principles
of
equity
and
common
law
take
original
jurisdiction
of
this
case
in
the
manner
in
which
water
diversion
cases
or
pollution
cases
are
taken.
for
in
that
sense
when
we
consider
direct
injury,
there
really
is
a
very
little
distinction
between
those
classes
of
cases.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
our
answer
would
be,
we
would
hope
of
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
not
from
the
state
of
new
hampshire
[laughter]
we
would
certainly
so
argue.
we
would
also
of
course
rely
upon
the
ability
of
the
court
as
demonstrated
in
--
as
demonstrated
time
and
again
to
exercise
what
is
inherently
is
equity
jurisdiction
and
of
course
we
would
argue
that
as
an
equitable
matter,
a
jury
would
be
an
appropriate.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
our
answer
in
that
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
would
be
that
i
believe
where
a
jury
is
called,
the
question
of
liability
is
at
issue.
what
we
would
argue
and
reply
to
that
is
that
the
question
of
liability,
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax
at
any
rate
is
the
question
which
already
has
been
disposed
of
by
this
court.
all
that
is
left
to
do
is
to
add
up
a
bill.
how
much
in
fact
has
new
hampshire
diverted,
assuming
arguendo
that
our
diversion
argument
will
prevail,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
on
the
narrow
question
of
adding
up
the
tally
and
perhaps
adding
up
the
interest
which
we
hope
also
would
be
added,
that
is
not
only
an
appropriate
to
require
a
jury,
but
that
is
a
jury
with
essentially
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
that
is
exactly
and
that
again
mr.
justice
rehnquist
reinforces
the
fact
that
essentially
we
are
invoking
your
equity
jurisdiction.
the
basic
question
of
liability
in
our
view
already
has
been
determined
by
this
court
in
a
prior
proceeding
and
the
proceeding
which
from
our
point
view
was
the
proper
one
that
have
brought
and
in
which
we
participated.
i
would
like
if
i
might
in
my
remaining
time
to
refer
to
an
issue
that
raised
in
the
other
argument
that
is
not
explicitly
raised
by
new
hampshire,
but
i
think
as
a
penumbra
matter
it
may
certain
be
brought
up
in
connection
with
our
case
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
the
individuals
would
be
necessary
parties
if
this
court
would
take
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
suggest
an
answer
to
that
that
all
three
states
have
maintained
their
rights
against
their
individual
tax
payers
and
if
following
our
successful
prosecution
of
this
case
in
original
jurisdiction,
any
tax
payer
of
the
state
of
vermont
would
have
appeared
in
new
hampshire
court,
claiming
the
same
types
of
damages,
our
answer
would
be
and
although
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
us
to
appear
as
parties,
we
certainly
would
apply
to
appear
as
amicus.
our
approach
would
be
in
that
case
to
suggest
to
the
trial
court
of
new
hampshire
that
no
claim
remains.
any
recovery
that
might
be
garnered
by
a
citizen
of
vermont
in
a
court
of
new
hampshire
would
be
matched
by
a
contrary
claim
by
vermont
against
that
citizen
based
upon
a
revocation
of
the
credit.
of
course
that
is
a
moot
issue
if
we
have
already
received
that
credit
money
directly
back
from
new
hampshire.
i
guess
in
short
the
answer
would
be
no
claim
remains
after
our
successful
prosecution
of
this
case
in
this
court.
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
that
would
be
your
honor,
damnum
absque
injuria.
there
has
been
no
harm,
but
the
--
mr.
benson
d.
scotch
not
if
he
has
been
given
full
credit
by
the
state
of
vermont
made
in
massachusetts.
he
may
have
been
harmed
initially,
but
certainly
any
money
that
he
would
recover
would
be
double
recovery
for
him.
he
has
been
granted
a
credit.
if
he
gets
another
payment
from
new
hampshire
he
has
been
doubly
been
enriched.
we
certainly
would
not
tolerate
that
and
we
would
state
in
court
that
we
would
appear
in
new
hampshire
in
some
appropriate
forum
to
bar
that
claim.
we
just
do
not
think
that
is
a
viable
possibility
in
the
courts
of
new
hampshire.
in
conclusion,
i
simply
would
say
that,
although
we
recognize
the
fierce
independent
spirit
that
seems
to
be
apparent
today,
particularly
in
our
region
of
the
country,
that
spirit
ought
to
be
guided
under
the
mantle
of
the
constitution
and
not
contrary
to
it
or
around
it.
that
the
main
point
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
court
is
that
if
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case,
to
look
at
the
intention
of
the
legislature,
to
see
if
any
intentional
wrong
and
intentional
harm
was
meant
at
the
time
they
adapted
their
statute
and
in
fact
effectuated,
then
i
can
imagine
any
such
case
ever
being
brought
to
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
