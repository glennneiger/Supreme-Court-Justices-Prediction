mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
have
to
confess
that
with
the
arguments
that
have
gone
before
me,
i
am
certainly
in
a
position
of
being
last,
i
hope
i
shall
not
to
be
found
to
be
least,
but
to
pass
up
any
discussion
whatsoever
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
way
that
case
arose,
i
think
is
very
familiar
to
the
court.
i
had
intended
to
do
to
outline
the
fundamental
basis
of
our
objection
to
this
motion
for
leave
to
file
which
is
that
this
court
must
in
any
such
case
a
find
a
basis
upon
an
actual
controversy
in
order
to
obtain
or
to
allow
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
be
invoked.
we
insist
that
there
is
no
such
controversy
presented
upon
the
complaint
sought
to
be
filed.
the
basis
upon
which
we
say
that
is
the
case
is
that
in
the
cases
of
texas
v.
florida
and
massachusetts
v.
missouri,
a
standard
was
set
out
in
which
the
plaintiff
seeking
--
a
plaintiff
state
seeking
to
invoke
this
original
jurisdiction
must
have
suffered
wrong
through
the
action
of
the
defendant
state
furnishing
ground
for
judicial
redress
or
that
plaintiff
must
be
asserting
a
right
against
a
defendant
state
of
susceptible
of
enforcement.
the
facts
alleged
in
this
complaint,
demonstrate
neither
in
either
an
injury
in
fact
to
the
plaintiff
sovereign
states,
nor
that
the
circumstance
which
they
assign
as
an
injury
is
in
any
way
caused
by
an
action
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
if
i
may
illustrate.
if
the
injury
assigned
is
the
lost
of
tax
revenue,
the
complaint
failed
to
show
that
new
hampshire
is
the
cause
of
it
since
the
immediate
cause
of
the
plaintiff’s
failure
to
collect
the
funds
is
in
their
own
credit
provisions
and
by
which
waive
the
collection
of
those
funds
voluntarily
and
within
their
own
unfetted
discretion.
the
first
requirement
of
a
justiciable
controversy
between
the
states
namely
that
of
an
injury
caused
by
the
plaintiff
state
was
applied
in
the
case
of
massachusetts
v.
missouri
and
the
court
held
there
that
since
the
plaintiff
had
full
constitutional
power
to
tax,
the
subject
matter,
no
intransigence
of
the
defendant
state
missouri
whether
in
the
form
of
improper
legislation
or
capricious
administration
of
proper
legislation
would
result
in
an
injury
to
the
plaintiff.
and
simply
put,
the
court
said,
look
missouri
has
a
statute
on
the
books
which
massachusetts
thinks
ought
to
be
construed
so
as
to
allow
massachusetts
the
unfettered
right
to
tax.
the
court
said,
okay,
if
that
is
what
massachusetts
thinks
let
them
go
into
missouri
and
challenge
the
state
of
missouri
to
prove
that
to
its
court.
the
problem
there
was
that
missouri
seem
to
be
inclined
to
administer
its
statute
in
a
way
which
massachusetts
did
not
agree
with.
the
problem
there
was
that
this
court
found
that
either
state
could
proceed
in
an
exhaustive
manner
to
assert
and
collect
the
tax
that
it
felt
to
be
due
under
it
is
own
statute.
that
is
still
a
situation
in
this
case.
if
the
plaintiff
states
think
they
are
entitled
to
the
money,
they
have
unfetted
power
to
collect
it
and
they
have
had
that
power
since
the
beginning
of
the
cause
in
question.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
believe
sir
your
addressing
the
question
that
came
up
before
and
that
is
if
during
the
existence
of
the
new
hampshire
tax,
maine
had
dissolved
the
credit,
would
new
hampshire
still
assert
the
tax
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
as
the
law
was
written,
your
honor,
yes
that
is
correct.
we
did
not
have
entirely
a
so
called
“sponge
tax.”
it
was
not
self
destructing
in
the
sense
that
the
credit
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
the
significance
of
that
i
think
is
this.
although
it
may
be
said
that
that
would
constitute
a
ground
for
either
the
austin
case
to
have
proceeded
or
this
case
to
proceed,
i
think
the
--
in
the
context
of
an
equity
consideration
of
this
case,
what
to
show
is
that
the
only
thing
that
the
plaintiff
states
had
to
do
in
order
to
really
throw
new
hampshire’s
case
into
a
cold
tab
(ph)
back
in
1970,
was
to
repeal
that
credit.
now
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
keep
in
mind,
sir,
that
the
new
hampshire
court
rendered
its
decision
upon
a
finding
of
no
substantial
injury
in
fact.
that
was
the
only
thing
they
decided.
they
did
accept
jurisdiction
of
the
case
on
the
theory
that
they
would
allow
standing
to
any
tax
payer
to
raise
just
about
any
question
at
all,
but
they
find
that
they
were
not
entitled
really
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue
because
they
were
not
injured.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
well,
i
think
it
would
your
honor,
in
the
court.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
as
the
case
would
have
appeared
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
am
saying
--
the
possibility
is
very
real,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
something
which
has
to
be
considered.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
effect
is
one
which
has
to
be
considered
and
to
some
extent
they
are
hypothetical,
but
i
think
it
is
a
very
certain
hypothetical
and
given
the
way
that
new
hampshire
supreme
court
decided
the
case.
in
summing
up
my
discussion
of
massachusetts
v.
missouri,
i
think
it
is
very
easy
to
read
that
case
as
being
dispositive
of
this
case
simply
because
the
analogy
is
direct.
here
the
plaintiffs
have
the
full
power
to
tax
irrespective
of
the
validity
of
any
new
hampshire
statute
and
the
rules
were
entirely
the
product
of
their
own
forbearance
in
the
form
of
this
tax
credit.
now,
this
court
held
in
austin
that
devoidity
of
the
new
hampshire
statute
may
not
turn
upon
the
configuration
of
the
statutes
of
another
state,
namely
maine.
well,
just
so
the
power
of
the
plaintiff
states
to
have
wholly
prevented
their
losses
and
to
recoup
those
losses
now
for
that
matter,
in
no
way
depend
upon
the
configuration
of
new
hampshire
statutes.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
curry
v.
mccanless,
travis
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
right,
well,
in
the
sense
that
--
yes
i
have,
i
would
say
they
have
the
power,
that
they
have
the
right,
i
think
it
is
in
a
legal
sense
the
same
thing
whether
it
would
be
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
correct,
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
is,
in
the
sense
of
an
equitable
consideration
of
the
plaintiffs’
rights
now
to
come
back
against
new
hampshire
to
recover
the
money,
the
fact
that
they
could
have
taken
action
in
1970,
which
would
have
literally
blown
our
statute
out
of
the
water,
constitutionally,
is
now
should
be
held
against
them
with
respect
to
their
right
to
claim.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
from
the
standpoint
of
maine
alone,
i
am
assuming
now
that
the
--
let
us
assume
for
instance
the
shape
of
the
carter
case.
two
states
have
broad-base
income
taxes
and
one
of
them
reaches
non-residence,
the
other
does
not.
the
one
in
which
the
non-residents
are
reached
is
sued
on
the
theory
that
that
is
unconstitutional.
the
holding
of
course
is
that
it
is
not
even
though
it
results
in
double
taxation
and
even
though
the
state
in
which
they
reside
does
not
grant
a
credit.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
if
both
states
have
constitutional
provisions
your
honor,
double
taxation
does
not
present
any
automatic
constitutional
conflict.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
if
maine
has
repealed
it
is
tax
credit
originally
or
for
that
matter
administratively
denied
it
to
persons
earning
an
income
in
new
hampshire
on
the
theory
that
the
new
hampshire
tax
is
not
a
valid
tax,
therefore,
it
does
not
exist,
therefore
no
credit.
either
of
those
two
theories,
that
would
have
enhanced,
excuse
me
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that
was
--
if
you
want
to
characterize
them
as
tender
mercies
your
honor,
yes,
it
is
true,
they
would
be
in
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
thing
that
prevents
them
from
maintaining
the
action
here
is
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
question
is
whether
it
actually
has
an
argument
with
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
your
honor.
the
state
of
maine
was
never
a
tax
payer
to
new
hampshire.
the
new
hampshire
statute
never
had
any
application
whatsoever
to
the
state
of
maine
as
a
sovereign.
it
created
no
rights
in
behalf
of
the
state
of
maine,
massachusetts,
or
vermont
and
created
no
liabilities
upon
them.
they
simply
ignored
them.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
in
a
way
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
think
it
is
sufficient.
that
is
why
i
said
i
think
given
only
that
finding
alone
i
think
massachusetts
v.
missouri
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
i
think
the
--
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
dissent
really
comes
home
in
an
analysis
of
this
case
simply
because
any
injury
that
the
three
states
who
are
now
plaintiffs
and
have
sustained
is
caused
as
a
matter
of
congeniality
is
entirely
attributable
to
to
the
existence
of
those
tax
credits
which
they
were
no
ways
required
constitutionally
to
maintain.
i
think
in
terms
of
an
equitable
analysis
of
the
case,
they
should
have
been
involved
in
this
case
from
the
beginning.
i
notice
my
brother
argued
that
they
felt
that
the
proper
procedure
was
to
remain
in
the
wings,
but
to
ask
them
to
take
part
and
aid
the
austin
plaintiffs
in
raising
their
constitutional
question.
if
that
so
then
where
were
they
in
the
context
of
raising
their
arguments
with
respect
to
recovery
of
funds
then.
i
see
a
considerable
element
of
the
equitable
doctrine
of
laches
applying
here.
a
court
of
equity
which
this
court
has
held
itself
to
be
when
considering
original
actions
is
very
reluctant
and
should
be
very
reluctant
to
award
damages
to
a
plaintiff
to
allow
a
recovery
against
a
defendant
when
the
plaintiff
has
an
effect
side
on
his
hands
and
allow
the
injury
to
magnify
many
fold.
that
is
the
essence
of
my
argument
in
saying
that
if
they
had
simply
taken
the
action
in
1970
and
had
the
courage
of
their
convictions
to
do
so,
this
case
would
have
had
an
entirely
different
configuration
in
a
new
hampshire
supreme
court
and
the
analysis
and
the
theory
upon
which
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
held
the
tax
to
be
valid
could
not
have
been
made
because
it
is
simply
was
not
true.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
new
hampshire
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
no
substantial
injury
in
fact.
if
maine
had
repealed
the
tax
credit,
they
are
clearly
would
have
been,
there
would
have
been
double
taxation.
i
admitted
this
much
in
my
argument
before
this
court
in
austin
last
spring.
simply
put,
we
think
the
claims
here
are
not
mutually
exclusive
in
the
sense
of
texas
v.
florida.
they
are
rather
precisely
analogous
to
that
in
mass.
v.
missouri.
the
second
basis
upon
which
a
controversy
can
be
maintained
here
is
that
there
is
a
right
susceptible
of
judicial
enforcement.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
austin
decision
create
a
right
in
someone
to
a
money
judgment
on
the
theory
that
taxes
have
been
collected
improperly,
that
supposed
right
does
not
tenure
to
the
plaintiffs
sovereign
states.
now,
these
states
were
of
course
not
tax
payers
to
new
hampshire.
as
i
said
before
they
were
in
--
the
statute
in
new
hampshire
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
three
plaintiff
states
here.
now,
the
principles
upon
which
the
austin
case
turn,
that
is
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
did
not
operate
to
the
benefit
of
sovereign
states.
since
there
not
persons
within
the
meaning
of
that
provision.
now,
if
the
right
asserted
here
inheres
in
anyone
it
inheres
in
the
former
tax
payers
to
new
hampshire
who
are
citizens
of
the
three
plaintiff
states.
now,
if
the
state
may
not
hold
forth
in
this
court
in
such
bulk
litigation
of
private
claims
is
settled
beyond
question.
in
new
hampshire
v.
louisiana,
illinois
v.
michigan,
a
long
line
of
cases,
this
court
has
denied
a
state
the
right
to
litigate
claims
on
behalf
of
private
citizens
in
particular.
in
oklahoma
v.
cook,
court
held
that
a
state
is
barred
from
litigating
claims
on
behalf
of
citizens
where
the
interest
of
the
states
arises
solely
as
a
result
of
a
statute
of
the
plaintiff
state.
simply
put
that
means
that
the
court
was
saying
that
a
state
may
not
legislate
its
way
into
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
that
we
submitted
is
what
the
three
plaintiff
states
have
done
in
affect
with
their
tax
credit
provisions.
now,
the
plaintiff’s
attempted
reliance
upon
the
missouri
v.
illinois
and
arizona
v.
california
lines
of
cases
is
misplaced
we
suggest.
firstly,
these
are
uniformly
instances
in
which
the
remedy
of
injunction
was
appropriate
to
halt
the
action
or
activity
of
the
defendant
state.
that
remedy
is
simply
inappropriate
here
since
the
tax
was
effectively
halted
by
austin
case
which
arose
through
conventional
appellate
channels.
furthermore,
the
notion
of
enjoining
state
action
that
--
state
taxation
excuse
me,
by
application
to
the
federal
judiciary
is
the
evil
redress
and
eliminated
by
the
federal
anti-tax
injunction
statute.
any
resort
to
this
court
on
the
theory
of
missouri
v.
illinois
for
an
injunction
is
clearly
in
contravention
of
the
--
at
least
the
spirit
of
that
statute
is
not
the
substance
of
it.
now,
i
would
mention
in
reply
to
a
contention
that
the
action
taken
by
new
hampshire
was
directed
at
the
treasuries
of
the
three
states
and
not
a
good
faith
effort
to
--
if
you
will
experiment
in
valid
state
taxation,
i
think
that
is
a
first
placed
question
that
comes
upon
the
merits
of
case
which
is
not
before
the
bar
now.
secondly,
it
is
in
large
measure
an
issue
of
fact
which
would,
if
the
cases
allowed
to
be
filed,
require
reference
to
a
master.
and
third,
it
simply
does
not
hold
water.
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
said,
he
has
trouble
seeing
the
state
of
new
hampshire
as
being
rascal
in
this
situation.
quite
obviously
so
do
i.
i
think
the
merits
of
the
case
of
are
something
which
need
not
be
considered
now
and
more
appropriately
should
not
be
considered
now
because
when
the
question
is
one
of
jurisdiction,
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
fatal
to
a
case
no
matter
how
strong
the
case
may
be
on
the
merits.
the
third
point,
i
would
like
to
raise
is
that
the
former
tax
payers
of
new
hampshire
are
necessary
parties
to
this
action.
this
issue
had
been
raised
in
the
prior
case
and
discussed.
i
would
like
to
amplify
it
only
to
the
point
of
saying
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
assumes
a
very
credible
element
and
that
is
that
in
the
chain
between
a
recovery
against
new
hampshire
by
a
tax
payer,
assuming
he
has
the
right
on
the
merits
to
that
recovery,
from
there
to
that
tax
payers’
obligation
to
return
that
money
to
his
own
state
on
the
theory
that
a
credit
was
improperly
allowed,
there
is
an
assumption
that
there
is
a
direct
equation
there.
there
is
nothing
in
this
complaint
which
goes
to
prove
that
assumption
is
correct.
it
assumes
that
the
tax
payers
who
are
also
citizens
of
those
three
plaintiff
states
have
no
right
whatsoever
to
interpose
between
a
recovery
from
new
hampshire,
assuming
the
tax
payers
were
the
ones
to
recover
and
the
obligation
to
return
it
to
their
own
states.
if
the
theory
of
the
plaintiffs
advanced
in
this
complaint
is
true,
that
result
would
be
reached
without
their
interest
being
represented,
without
any
opportunity
for
those
plaintiffs
to
even
present
such
a
claim,
if
you
will,
or
set
off
or
however
you
want
to
characterize
it.
there
are
certain
retroactive
problems
which
may
arise
in
this
connection.
the
point
is
that
this
assumption
is
made
in
the
compliant.
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
tax
payers
themselves
to
be
heard
on
that
matter
if
the
case
proceeds
on
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
if
on
the
other
hand
one
considers
“alright
let
us
bring
those
plaintiffs
in,”
then
on
the
holding
of
california
v.
southern
pacific
company
in
157
u.s.,
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
defeated,
ousted
if
you
will,
because
the
presence
of
citizens
of
the
plaintiff
states
is
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
if
they
are
necessary
parties,
they
are
also
fatal
parties.
i
submit
that
this
equation
which
is
the
basis
of
this
complaint
and
is
precisely
that
watershed
point
upon
which
the
plaintiff
states
assert
their
right
to
the
money
is
something
which
cannot
be
assumed
over
the
backs
of
the
tax
payers
themselves
who
are
the
only
ones
that
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
now,
this
court
applies
in
consideration
of
original
actions,
the
accepted
doctrines
of
common
law
and
equity,
system
of
jurisprudence
as
much
as
held
in
texas
v.
florida.
again
to
simplify
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
laches,
the
plaintiffs
assert
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
was
in
bad
faith
when
it
enacted
the
commuter's
income
tax.
we
say
to
the
extent
the
plaintiffs
claim
that
new
hampshire
should
have
known
that
the
tax
scheme
was
unconstitutional,
so
too
the
plaintiffs
are
also
bound
to
have
analyzed
and
known
that
law
and
should
have
responded
from
the
beginning
in
a
matter
consistent
with
their
convictions.
i
think
it
is
patently
obvious
that
the
great
part,
if
not
all
of
the
injury
which
they
have
now
sustained
are
claimed
to
have
sustained
could
have
been
obviated
by
action
taken
in
the
original
configuration
of
the
cases
that
came
before
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
it
is
also
more
likely
the
case
that
that
same
action
can
still
be
taken.
i
would
point
out
that
this
case
--
that
this
court
in
austin
remanded
the
austin
case
to
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
at
last
check
that
case
was
still
before
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
and
there
has
been
no
action
taken
one
way
or
the
other.
there
has
been
no
request
for
any
action
to
be
taken
by
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
but
it
is
still
an
open
case
in
that
regard.
any
comment
by
me
would
be
obviously
speculation
as
to
what
the
plaintiffs
might
want
to
do
if
they
were
compelled
to
go
into
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
but
i
certainly
see
no
constitutional
bar
from
--
to
them
doing
so.
i
think
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
is
an
available
forum.
i
think
a
class
action
is
certainly
an
available
remedy.
all
of
this
seems
to
add
up
to
one
simple
point.
the
entire
claim
that
these
three
states
bring
is
based
upon
this
connection
between
their
own
tax
payers
and
their
right
to
the
funds.
that
was
entirely
within
their
control
and
i
think
they
should
be
now
barred
from
this
court
for
a
number
of
reasons,
some
of
which
are
purely
jurisdiction,
some
of
which
are
equitable,
but
they
all
come
down
to
the
same
point.
it
is
not
too
late
to
come
back
and
try
to
unwind
the
situation
which
could
have
been
avoided
with
continuities.
thank
you
very
much.
