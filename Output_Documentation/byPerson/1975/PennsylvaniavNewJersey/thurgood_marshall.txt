justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
saying
that
maine
and
the
other
states
have
the
right
to
put
a
double
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah,
but
you
sort
of
put
right
in
quotes,
do
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
say
that,
you
have
raised
the
second
point,
how
does
that
prevent
them
from
maintaining
their
action
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
when
i
read
the
constitution,
it
says
that
the
state
of
maine
does
not
have
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire,
if
it
has
got
an
argument
with
the
state
of
new
hampshire?
