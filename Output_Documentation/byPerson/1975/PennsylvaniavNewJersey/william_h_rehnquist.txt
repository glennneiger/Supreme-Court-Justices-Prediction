justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
case,
then
is
different
from
maine
in
massachusetts
that,
in
your
case,
it
has
not
been
established
that
the
new
jersey
tax
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
standing
does
pennsylvania
have
to
challenge
the
new
jersey
tax
insofar
as
it
bears
on
pennsylvania
citizens?
in
austin,
the
challenge
was
by
individual
taxpayers
claiming
violation
of
privileges
and
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
acting
as
a
withholder
and
as
a
conduit
of
the
money
at
least.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
do
that
in
the
case
where
the
other
defendant
is
a
state
under
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ex
parte
young
does
not
involve
any
judgments
of
any
kind
against
the
state.
it
is
an
injunction
against
state
officials.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
not
preclude
a
suit
where
the
state
is
really
not
suing
in
the
classical
boundary
sense
or
water
diversion
sense
but,
instead,
really
on
behalf
of
its
own
citizens
in
a
parens
patriae
capacity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
does
not
say
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
nonetheless,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
a
group
of
citizens
of
pennsylvania
could
not
get
together
and
sue
new
jersey
in
the
federal
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
new
jersey.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
are
two
reasons
where
citizens
of
pennsylvania
cannot
sue
the
state
of
new
jersey.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
certainly
should
not,
under
our
regular
jurisdiction,
simply
allow
that
to
be
circumvented
in
a
dressed-up
original
action
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
pennsylvania
should
succeed
in
its
efforts
in
this
court
to
get
the
money
back,
could
new
jersey
plead
the
judgment
of
this
court
in
an
action
by
individual
taxpayers
of
pennsylvania
seeking
to
recover
moneys
as
were
done
by
the
individual
taxpayers
in
austin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
want
money
too,
do
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
want
money
not
to
go
back
to
the
individuals
who
paid
the
new
jersey
tax
but
you
want
money
to
go
into
the
coffers
of
the
pennsylvania
state
treasury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then,
why
when
the
individual
taxpayer
comes
and
sues
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
says
“your
tax
was
unconstitutional,”
and
new
jersey
says
“we
have
already
paid
money
into
the
general
fund
of
pennsylvania,”
why
should
he
not
be
able
to
answer
and
says
“fine,
that
is
great
for
the
state
of
pennsylvania
but
this
came
out
of
my
pocket
and
i
got
to
get
it
right
to
get
it
back
in
my
pocket”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
we
foreclose
individual
taxpayers
who
were
not
parties
to
this
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
a
rather
unique
version
of
collateral
estoppel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
in
austin
the
individual
taxpayers
got
the
money
back?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
underlying
hypothesis,
as
i
understand
it,
in
massachusetts
v.
missouri
was
that
each
of
the
states
could
tax
the
particular
estate
consistently
with
the
constitution.
here,
i
take
it,
pennsylvania
takes
the
position
that
new
jersey
cannot
consistently
with
the
constitution
impose
this
tax
on
citizens
of
pennsylvania.
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
massachusetts
v.
missouri
then
turned
on
the
concept
of
the
bar
of
double
taxation
or
the
claim
that
those
two
states
could
not
tax
the
same
estate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
that
it
kind
of
transfered
all
disputes
about
the
authority
of
the
states
to
levy
taxes
under
interstate
commerce
from
other
courts
to
this
court
under
its
original
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
this
can
be
viewed
as
a
fight
between
states,
what
interstate
commerce
taxation
problem
cannot
be?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
we
presumably
would
have
not
just
new
jersey
against
pennsylvania
but
we
would
have
to
join
new
york
and
delaware
and
maryland
so
that
everybody
could
be
heard
from.
justice
rehnquist
are
you
being
animus
against
pennsylvania
as
a
sovereign
entity
rather
than
just
to
decide
to
collect
as
much
money
as
possible?
justice
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
pennsylvania
has
had
within
its
own
power
at
all
times
to
prevent
that
injury.
how
about
the
old
common
law
maxim
of
volenti
non
fit
injuria
that
if
you
have
it
within
your
own
power
to
prevent
the
harm,
you
cannot
come
to
court
and
complain
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
any
of
recovery
the
individuals
got
the
nullity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
all
that
as
quite
as
clear
as
you
make
it
sound?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
room
has
only
been
here
for
about
40
years.[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
the
building
has
only
been
here
for
about
--[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
a
part
of
presumably
the
law
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
that
and
you
say
you
have
got
a
strong
case
here
under
that
because
of
that
fact,
but
if
we
start
taking
these
cases,
we
are
going
to
have
to
entertain
arguments
that
are
presumably
a
good
deal
less
persuasive
than
yours,
once
we
let
the
cases
in
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
put
an
answer
in
any
of
that
litigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really,
your
distinction
between
death
taxes
double
and
income
tax
double
is
really
boils
down
to
nothing
more
than
the
idea
that
dead
people
cannot
vote,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
read
curtis
against
lozer,
two
years
ago
where
we
said
that
if
you
are
going
to
award
damages,
you
must
have
a
jury
in
the
federal
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
that
is
not
traditional
damage,
that
is
more
of
an
accounting
type?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
under
your
submission,
a
vermont
commuter
into
new
hampshire
was
unconstitutionally
required
to
pay
taxes
by
new
hampshire?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
sure
thinks
there
is
harm
i
would
imagine?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
to
be
double
taxation,
is
it
not
automatic
indication
of
unconstitutional
(voice
overlap)
