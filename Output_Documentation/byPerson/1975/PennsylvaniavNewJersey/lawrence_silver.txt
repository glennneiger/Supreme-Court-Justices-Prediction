mr.
lawrence
silver
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
silver
i
am
aware
of
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think
in
order
to
fully
understand
the
issues
relating
to
that,
some
explanation
has
to
be
made
of
the
underlying
tax
statute
that
would
be
brief
as
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
silver
the
statute
similar
to
the
one
declaring
constitutional
in
austin
v.
new
hampshire.
mr.
lawrence
silver
of
course,
the
pennsylvania
in
1971
passed
the
domestic
income
tax
and,
in
response
to
that,
new
jersey
passed
its
commuter’s
tax
known
as
the
transportation
benefits
tax
act.
it
taxes
both
pennsylvania
citizens
who
cross
over
to
new
jersey
and
new
jersey
citizens
who
cross
to
pennsylvania,
but
immediately
exempts
those
persons
and,
in
fact,
even
does
not
require
the
filing
of
a
return.
the
issue,
therefore,
is
whether
or
not
that
statute
falls
squarely
within
the
holding
in
austin,
and
we
think
it
does.
the
issue
before
the
court
raised
by
new
jersey’s
motion,
our
position,
is
whether
pennsylvania,
as
a
state,
has
standing
to
sue
first
for
declaration
that
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
the
injunctive
relief
which
should
follow
and,
the
second
issue,
whether
or
not
has
standing
to
seek
the
retroactive
application
of
such
determination
and
an
accounting
and
repayment
for
the
funds
collected
by
new
jersey.
mr.
lawrence
silver
there
is
no
court
declaration
as
to
that.
we
have
two
aspects.
we
have
a
first
hurdle
to
get
over.
they
already
have
the
austin
case,
which
we
do
not.
in
the
first
instance,
we
would
ask
the
court
first
to
take
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
or
is
not
constitutional.
i
might
add
that
i
hope
to
explore
the
issue
to
be
so
clear
as
to
really
require
summary
disposition
of
that
matter
by
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
silver
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
assert
several
issues
standing
as
to
our
first
count.
the
first
issue
and
i
think
the
most
important
one
is
that,
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
the
commerce
clause,
what
keeps
the
nation
together
is
the
privileges
and
the
immunities
clause,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
pennsylvania
as
a
state
suffers
a
trespass
against
it
when
its
citizens’
privileges
and
immunities
are
violated.
the
support
for
that
proposition,
first,
i
think
is
in
ward
v.
maryland.
also,
in
footnote
5,
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
in
austin
where
james
madison
requested
information
on
what
is
to
prevent
the
trespassers
of
one
state
against
another
state.
the
answer
was
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
that
pennsylvania
has
been
independently
harmed
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
its
citizens
and
i
might
add,
in
support
of
that
proposition,
this
court’s
opinion
in
travers
v.
towne
and
yale
manufacturing
company,
there,
there
was
a
corporation
whose
act
was
nothing
more
than
withholding
the
money
of
its
employees.
this
court
permitted
that
corporation
to
assert
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
its
employees.
now,
pennsylvania,
i
would
like
to
add--
mr.
lawrence
silver
yes,
but
it
did
not
allege
that
its
privilege
and
immunities
were
being
violated
but
that
its
employees’
privileges
and
immunities
were
violated,
and
their
standing
to
raise
that
was
sustained
by
this
court.
i
would
add
also,
i
think
the
answer
is
contained
in
mr.
justice
marshall’s
opinion
at
6-62
in
which
it
is
said
that
the
issue
that
privileges
and
immunities,
in
terms
of
maintaining
peace
between
the
states
that
the
constitution
seeks
to
establish
is
such
an
important
issue
that
it
has
a
high
degree
of
judicial
inquiry.
that
is
language
that
i
believe
to
be
the
converse
in
terms
of
the
required
level
of
standing.
now,
pennsylvania
also
asserts
its
interest
parens
patriae
to
represent
its
citizens,
stand
in
the
shoes
of
its
citizens
to
seek
a
declaration
that
a
statute
of
a
sister
state
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
lawrence
silver
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
in
pennsylvania
v.
west
virginia,
west
virginia
passed
a
statute
which
said
that
before
you
export
natural
gas
to
any
other
state,
you
must
ensure
that
the
demands
of
west
virginia
are
first
satisfied.
pennsylvania,
by
its
self
as
well
as
in
behalf
of
its
citizens’
parens
patriae
together
with
ohio,
commenced
original
actions
in
this
court
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
statute
was
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
and
this
court
permitted
pennsylvania
in
that
case
to
seek
a
declaration
that
a
sister
state
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
question
that
you
raise
in
addition
to
the
one
that
i
think
i
have
tried
to
answer
is
the
other
aspect
and
that
is
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
eleventh
amendment
only
precludes,
as
i
understand
it,
money
judgments
as
against
a
sister
state
except
the
area
under
the
exceptions
of
ex
parte
young
but
that
only--
mr.
lawrence
silver
an
injunction,
but
i
would
assert,
first
of
all,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
only
preclude
suits
against
states
but
only
suits
by
individuals
against
states.
mr.
lawrence
silver
your
honor,
i
think
that
first
of
all,
as
i
have
said,
that
the
trespass
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
as
to
its
citizens
is
an
independent
and
separate
trespass
in
pennsylvania,
as
i
think
the
opinion
in
austin
supports
that
proposition.
mr.
lawrence
silver
i
agree,
not
in
a
clear
language
but
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
this
court’s
treatment
of
it
would
certainly
support
that
proposition.
in
addition,
i
do
not
think
that
the
eleventh
amendment
comes
up
in
the
new
hampshire
v.
louisiana
where
the
state
is
really
not
acting
in
its
sovereign
capacity
but
seeks
an
avoidance
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
there
cannot
be
an
assertion
that
pennsylvania
is
trying
to
walk
around
the
eleventh
amendment
by
some
act
of
an
assignment
of
bond
claims
as
there
was
in
new
hampshire
v.
louisiana.
mr.
lawrence
silver
for
two
reasons,
first
of
all,
they
may
be
able
to
sue
an
officer.
mr.
lawrence
silver
but
that
is
an
eleventh
amendment
problem.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
resolves
the
eleventh
amendment
problems,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
it
does
not
resolve
the
problem
created
for
those
people
under
28
usc
1341,
the
anti-tax
injunction
statute,
which
precludes
a
citizen
from
utilizing
the
federal
courts
to
enjoin
a
tax
in
federal
courts
unless
there
is
a
plain
speedy
remedy.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
silver
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
dressed-up
original
action
in
a
sense
that
28
usc
1341
specifically
limits
its
operations
to
the
district
courts
implying,
i
think,
the
congressional
intent
that
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
states,
that
the
state
may
clearly
go
to
this
court,
that
to
suggest
that
it
is
an
enron
to
stand
the
jurisdiction
of
this
courts
on
its
head
and
that
this
is
the
perfectly
proper
place
to
go
because
pennsylvania,
as
i
intend
to
demonstrate
in
the
argument,
has
suffered
an
injury
in
addition
to
the
injury
suffered
by
its
citizens.
mr.
lawrence
silver
okay,
i
would
assert
also
that
i
think
that
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
in
terms
of
once
the
court
reaches
the
issue,
new
jersey
has
conceded
with
one
exception,
that
their
statute
is
precisely
similar
to
the
statute
declared
by
this
court
to
be
unconstitutional
in
austin,
except
with
one
aspect
and
that
aspect
is
that
the
use
of
the
money
is
to
go
to
transportation
purposes.
this
court
in
a
long
line
of
opinions
has
said
that
there
are
really
two
aspects
to
any
tax.
the
first
aspect
is
the
imposition.
the
second
aspect
is
the
use.
and,
the
court
has
often
said
that
whatever
the
use
is,
if
the
use
is
improper,
we
would
enjoin
the
use
but
an
improper
use
will
not
declare
unconstitutional,
a
proper
tax
and,
likewise,
i
would
assert
that
the
only
assertion
by
new
jersey
to
distinguish
their
act
is
one
that
is
really
relevant.
going
back
to
the
issue
of
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
terms
of
the
retroactive
relief
that
we
seek,
the
pennsylvania
gave
a
tax
credit,
it
does
give
a
tax
credit,
to
all
of
its
citizens
who
pay
income
tax
to
another
state,
i
might
add
that
every
state
which
surrounds
pennsylvania,
has
domestic
income
tax
with
the
exception
of
new
jersey.
this
is
a
tax
credit,
your
honor.
now,
we
do
provide
for
a
tax
credit
as
to
all
states.
i
think
that
pennsylvania
has
within
its
constitutional
powers,
as
was
stated
by
justice
marshall
in
austin,
has
the
power
and
the
authority
to
grant
such
a
tax
credit.
the
fact
that
its
tax
credit
also
creates
harm
for
it
does
not
preclude
it
from
complaining
for
one
retroactive
relief
and
the
money
judgment
in
this
court.
yes,
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
lawrence
silver
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
silver
i
think
so,
your
honor.
if
a
state
has
the
power
to
do
something,
it
need
not
release
that
right
and
power
to
accommodate
the
unconstitutional
acts
of
a
sister
state.
if
pennsylvania
has
the
right
to
act
properly
in
this
way
and
does
act
within
its
power,
and
by
the
exercise
of
its
proper
power,
is
harmed
by
the
constitutional
acts
of
another
state,
i
think
that
it
does
create
a
controversy.
pennsylvania
need
not
accommodate
or
surrender
its
proper
right
to
accommodate
the
unconstitutional
acts
of
a
sister
state.
now,
the
alternative
that
pennsylvania
could
do,
pennsylvania
could
amend
its
statute
and
say
“we
will
give
you
a
tax
credit
for
every
state
except
new
jersey
because
we
think
their
statute
is
unconstitutional.”
that
is
the
very
type
of
conduct
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
was
designed
to
prohibit
retaliatory
actions
by
one
state
against
another
state
and,
in
fact,
i
would
even
suggest
there
is
a
possibility
that
if
we
passed
such
a
tax
exemption
exempting
only
new
jersey
citizens,
that
pennsylvania
would
also
be
in
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
if
not
of
the
equal
protection
clause
by
singling
out
new
jersey
but
until
new
jersey
statute
is
declared
unconstitutional,
pennsylvania
has
of
course
the
right
to
give
such
a
tax
credit.
that
it
may
be
harmed
as
a
consequence
does
give
it
the
right
to
complain
in
a
court.
now,
the
reasons
for
the
retroactive
application
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
but
new
jersey
was
unnoticed
certainly
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act,
certainly
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
austin
case,
and
certainly
at
the
time,
this
court
issued
its
austin
decision
and
it
is
a
constitutional
tort
feaser.
it
should
not
be
permitted
to
maintain
the
benefit
that
it
has
achieved
by
reason
of
its
unconstitutional
acts
and,
therefore,
we
would
assert
that
it
is
not
only
within
the
power
but
the
proper
power
of
this
court
to
say
to
new
jersey
“you
have
unconstitutionally
collected
a
tax
and
you
may
not
be
able
to
keep
that
tax.”
to
do
otherwise
were
to
basically
encourage
states
to
come
so
close
to
violating
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
that
if
they
are
wrong,
they
get
to
keep
the
bounty
which,
in
pennsylvania’s
case
at
this
point,
is
approximately
$29
million.
i
would
say
that—
mr.
lawrence
silver
your
honor,
they
took
a
tax
credit
in
pennsylvania
for
which
they
were
relieved
of
tax
liability
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
lawrence
silver
whether
it
is
a
taxable
income
is
not
an
easy
question,
but
we
would
assert
that
it
would
require
an
amendment
of
the
prior
return
because
the
prior
return
would
show
a
tax
credit.
mr.
lawrence
silver
we
should
hope
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
lawrence
silver
i
should
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
silver
because
first
of
all,
the
judgment
of
this
court,
if
we
would
get
all
the
relief
that
we
request,
would
first
have
to
determine
pennsylvania’s
prior
right
to
the
tax
moneys.
mr.
lawrence
silver
and
that
judgment,
therefore--
mr.
lawrence
silver
certainly.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
it
is
the
coffers
of
the
pennsylvania
state
treasury
which
effectively
has
been
diverted
to
new
jersey.
mr.
lawrence
silver
as
i
said,
i
think
the
judgment
of
this
court
would
determine
that
pennsylvania
has,
since
the
funds
were
diverted
from
it
and
the
judgment
of
this
court
would
have
to
make
that
determination
in
order
for
us
to
be
successful,
that
that
judgment
could
be
pleaded
that
the
individual
taxpayers
do
not
have
the
right
following
a
judgment
of
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
silver
i
guess
this
is
the
notion
of
i
think
collateral
estoppel,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
is
right.
i
am
sorry.
i
think
you
are
right.
it
is
not
collateral
estoppel.
i
think
you
are
right,
mr.
justice
white,
and
that
is
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
the
money
and
that
this
court
would
determine
that
pennsylvania’s
right
for
security.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
is
correct.
that
was
the
point
of
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
dissent
in
austin.
mr.
lawrence
silver
that
remains
to
be
seen,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
did
occur.
i
will
allow--
mr.
lawrence
silver
certainly.
we
certainly
want,
first,
the
prospective
relief
to
enjoin
the
statute,
and
i
just
might
add
that
if
this
court
would
grant
leave
at
least
as
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
easier
issue
as
to
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
we
would
file
then
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
to
enjoin
possible
retroactive
question
after
january
1
of
this
year
because,
at
that
time,
again
the
returns
will
start
being
filed
for
the
tax
year
of
1974.
in
order
to
avoid
a
much
more
difficult
collection
problem
that
already
exists,
i
would
file
at
that
time
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
now,
i
think
the
question,
although
i
really
have
not
addressed
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
those
terms
in
your
request
that
i
address
myself
to
massachusetts
v.
missouri
has
really
been
answered
in
the
dialog
between
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
mr.
justice
white,
and
myself
in
that
the
question
in
massachusetts
v.
missouri
was
the
mutual
exclusiveness
of
the
claims
and
what
i
think
we
have
been
talking
about
is
whether
or
not
the
claims
of
the
taxpayers
and
the
claims
of
pennsylvania
are
mutually
exclusive.
we
claim
that
they
are,
that
since
the
moneys
were
diverted
from
the
treasury
of
pennsylvania
and,
in
fact,
if
the
court
is
going
to
have
retroactive
relief
in
terms
that
the
pennsylvania
taxpayers
just
the
administrative
problem
of
returning
it
to
60,000
pennsylvania
taxpayers
over
a
period
of
three
years,
would
be
much
easier
to
serve
than
pennsylvania’s
attempt
to
collect
that
money,
if
the
money
went
to
the
pocket
from
which
it
was
taken,
and
that
is
pennsylvania
treasury.
and
really,
what
the
issue
involved
in
massachusetts
v.
missouri
is
an
issue
relating
to
mutual
exclusiveness,
and
what
i
think
the
court’s
decision
in
that
case
was
that
the
issue
between
the
states
could
not
be
resolved
by
this
court
because
both
courts,
although
could
come
up
with
inconsistent
judgments,
those
inconsistent
judgments
were
not
necessarily
mutually
exclusive.
the
only
other
question
that
is
raised,
i
believe,
by
new
jersey’s
brief
that
i
wish
to
deal
with
is
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
court
can
give
a
money
judgment,
and
i
think
that
it
has
in
the
case
of
virginia
v.
west
virginia
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
it
is
at
38-202
and
has
ordered
the
judicial
sale
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
a
possible
judgment
in
south
dakota
v.
north
carolina
at
192-286.
also,
i
think
this
court
has
always
been
troubled
i
believe
over
its
ability
to
execute
judgments
in
original
actions
and
i
think,
i
would
refer
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
griffin
v.
thompson
which
mr.
justice
daniels
said
at
43
us
244
that
there
is
an
inherent
power
in
every
court
to
exercise
and
execute
upon
its
judgments
and,
frankly,
i
think
he
says
without
this
power,
courts
would
be
wholly
impotent
and
useless
and
that
this
court
has
the
power
under
its
original
jurisdiction
to
establish
whatever
necessary
common
law
requirements
are
to
effectuate
the
judgment,
and
i
think
the
assertion
that
there
is
an
ability
to
effectuate
this
court’s
judgment
is
a
red
herring
case.
let
us
get
the
judgment
i
think
and
then
worry
about
how
to
execute
it.
i
think
there
is
an
argument
that
new
jersey’s
public
officials
who
have
to
obey
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states
would
have
to,
under
their
oath,
obey
the
judgment
of
this
court.
i
would
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
silver
your
honor,
just
very
briefly
i,
during
lunch
or
recess,
would
like
to
further
amplify
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
remark
or
questions
to
me.
there
is
no
doubt
that
new
jersey
did
consult
with
pennsylvania
and
extended
certain
courtesies,
but
i
think
this
court
should
know
that,
first
of
all,
their
tax
is
almost
a
mirror
image
of
ours.
in
fact,
some
of
our
embarrassment,
the
same
typographical
and
grammatical
errors
that
appear
on
our
act
also
appears
in
new
jersey’s
act.
i
think
it
is
essential
and
important
to
know
that
every
single
time,
we
have
changed
the
rate,
which
has
only
been
two
times
that
initially
it
was
2.3%
and
new
jersey
had
it
at
2.3%
and
when
we
changed
it
to
2%
new
jersey
immediately
changed
theirs
too
and
that
i
think,
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
target
here
has
been
pennsylvania
and
not
its
citizens
and
truly,
in
support
of
this
position,
i
would
rely
on
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
dissenting
opinion.
one
of
the
reasons,
one
might
ask
is
why
has
not
a
citizen
attacked
it?
because,
if
he
attacks
the
statute
and
he
is
successful,
he
pays
the
same
amount
of
money
in
pennsylvania
by
reason
of
what
new
jersey
has
done
in
terms
of
retaliation
and
it
is
pennsylvania’s
treasury
that
is
being
harmed
by
this
statute.
mr.
lawrence
silver
well,
your
honor,
this
statute
does
not
tax
all
non-residents
and
that
is
a
point
that
i
think
should
be
emphasized.
this
tax
statute
says
the
commissioner
of
transportation
shall
select
a
border
state
which
has
a
critical
transportation
problem
and,
under
this
statute,
they
did
not
pick
delaware
or
new
york.
they
only
picked
pennsylvania
and
the
rate
is
the
exact
same
rate
as
pennsylvania’s
rate.
it
is,
and
it
was
enacted
right
after
our
tax
was
acted.
so,
it
is
a
rate
by
new
jersey,
a
courtesy,
i
agree
but
nonetheless
a
rate
upon
the
treasury.
a
courteous
rate,
but
nonetheless
an
unconstitutional
one.
and
although
we
might
have
gotten
into
intellectual
discussions
about
parens
patriae,
etcetera,
the
primary
argument
which
i
had
in
my
brief
and
relied
on
it
on
perhaps
more
academic
arguments
but
i
think
arguments
that
are
meritorious,
but
i
think
the
easier
argument
is
pennsylvania
is
the
real
party
harmed.
mr.
lawrence
silver
well,
it
might
be,
but
new
jersey’s
courts
could
very
easily
adapt
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
position
in
his
dissent
and
say
“you
have
no
standing
because
you
have
no
injury,
because
if
you
win,
you
lose
because
you
pay
the
money.”
mr.
lawrence
silver
yes,
your
honor,
in
three
years
or
so
when
the
retroactive
relief
we
would
be
seeking
would
be
many
more
millions
of
dollars
than
it
is
already,
and
i
might
add,
we
have
waited
three
years
and
i
think
the
answer
is
really
contained
in
mr.
justice
brennan’s
statement,
there
has
been
substantial
efforts
to
get
new
jersey
to
pass
an
income
tax,
and
i
concede
that
if
they
tax
their
citizens
the
same
way
they
are
taxing
our
citizens,
we
would
not
have
the
same
constitutional
underpinnings
for
this
argument.
it
became
abundantly
clear
in
july,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
new
jersey
was
not
going
to
pass
an
income
tax,
and
in
august
we
filed
our
action.
and,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
i
just
may
say
one
more
point,
this
is
not
a
subtle
attempt
to
utilize
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
vindicate
what
is
essentially
a
private
right.
this
is
not
an
attempt
like
in
new
hampshire
v.
louisiana
to
take
an
assignment
of
bonds
but
it
is
an
attempt
to
rectify
and
to
protect
pennsylvania’s
fisc.
it
is
a
direct
interference
with
pennsylvania’s
interest.
now,
to
do
that,
they
must
assert
its
unconstitutionality
and,
upon
that,
must
be
the
infringement
to
its
citizens
or
the
infringement,
as
i
have
suggested,
to
itself.
mr.
lawrence
silver
i
think
that
the
kind
of
harm
we
could
prevent
is
in
the
nature
i
think
of
the
last
clear
chance
rather
than
if
you
have
the
constitutional
power
to
do
something
properly
and
you
would
exercise
that
power
within
your
right
to
avoid
the
unconstitutional
acts
of
another.
i
think
that
new
jersey
has
relied
on
what
is
a
floodgates
argument,
that
if
the
court
opens
itself
up
to
this
case
there
will
be
a
floodgate
problem.
i
think
not,
if
you
grant
all
of
the
relief
that
we
request
and
even
if
you
grant
part
of
the
relief,
but
i
think
the
issue
that
we
have
said
is
that
what
must
be
prevented
is
for
a
state
to
enact
a
statute
which
so
clearly
comes
close
to
constitutional
violations,
that
all
we
ask
is
that
if
a
state
does
violate
the
constitution
that
it
pay
back
the
money
that
it
has
improperly
got,
that
is
not
a
penalty
but
that
is
a
substantial
deterrent
that
states
should
and
i
ensure
you
will
consider
in
the
enactment
of
legislation
in
the
future,
and
by
granting
that
relief
states
will
steer
clear
of
the
kind
of
constitutional
violations
that
have
been
suffered
in
this
case.
i
would
just
respond
to
one
matter
that
came
up
in
argument
before
lunch.
i
think
that
the
matter
that
their
brief
in
opposition
can
be
treated
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
think
that
the
arguments
can
be
resolved
on
the
merits
at
the
present
posture
on
the
legal
issues.
certainly,
regardless
of
what
new
jersey
would
do
in
terms
of
an
answer,
we
would
file
a
motion
for
file
for
summary
judgment
or
an
alternative
judgment
on
the
pleadings
of
waiting
their
answer,
but
the
issue
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
tax
is
a
legal
question.
this
court
can
look
at
the
statutes
without
any
reference
to
any
facts.
the
statue
is
clearly
there.
the
only
argument
i
just
would,
not
reiterate
but
just,
remind
that
i
made
is
the
fact
that
new
jersey
may
use
this
tax
for
transportation
purposes
does,
if
the
taking
is
wrongful
to
begin
with,
the
use
does
not
save
it
even
if
the
use
were
as
a
donation
to
the
fisc
of
pennsylvania,
as
meritorious
as
pennsylvania
would
find
that
to
be,
we
would
still
say
that
such
a
meritorious
use,
a
donation
to
our
treasury
would
not
save
the
unconstitutional
taking.
thank
you.
