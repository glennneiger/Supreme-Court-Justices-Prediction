mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
well
mr.
justices
may
i
please
the
court.
i
will
certainly
try
to
and
much
of
our
thunder,
frankly
has
been
stolen
in
many
respects.
the
facts
in
this
case
really
are
not
in
dispute.
the
action
of
the
plaintiff
states
is
in
the
sovereign
and
proprietary
capacities
to
recover
funds
diverted
by
the
unconstitutional
new
hampshire
income
tax.
this
tax
was
imposed
in
1970.
it
was
challenged
in
1971
by
maine's
citizens,
with
strong
support
from
the
state
of
maine.
it
was
held
unconstitutional
in
march.
it
is
violative
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
as
we
see
it,
the
essential
ultimate
question
is,
“whether
or
not
new
hampshire
should
benefit
from
such
unconstitutional
conduct
with
this
unconstitutional
tax
scheme,
by
retaining
the
proceeds
of
that
scheme
which
amount
to
some
$13.5
million
which
were
diverted
from
the
plaintiffs’
treasuries.
we
say
that
the
plaintiffs
are
the
appropriate
parties.
we
say
they
were
hurt,
as
was
intended
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
for
the
individual
tax
payers
to
bring
this
action,
or
to
bring
an
action,
assuming
they
can
get
over
standing
issue,
assuming
they
can
show
some
injury
would
be
as
has
been
said
earlier
“repetitious
or
be
costly.”
any
damages
that
were
awarded
would
have
to
be
turned
over
to
the
plaintiff
states
so
there
would
be
absolutely
no
incentive
for
them
to
do
it.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
i
think
a
class
action
might
be
available,
but
again
they
would
run
into
the
same
problem
withstanding
that
class
wouldn’t
be
hurt.
the
party
that
is
hurt
is
massachusetts,
maine
and
vermont.
they
bore
the
burden.
their
treasuries
did
not
receive
money,
they
would
otherwise
have
received
had
it
been
not
for
this
unconstitutional
tax.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
well,
in
reference
to
the
possibility
of
retaliation,
the
cases
of
this
court
have
emphasized,
several
times
and
as
recently
as
austin
against
the
policy
of
retaliation.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
there
is
no
other
way
that
i
am
aware
of
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
well,
if
we
were
to
change
our
law
that
would
mean,
to
amend
the
law,
and
not
to
give
the
tax
credit.
that
in
effect
could
be
retaliation
against
our
residents
who
work
in
new
hampshire
and
we
then
would
not
be
retaliating
against
our
residents
who
may
have
worked
in
39
other
states
where
we
give
tax
credits.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
i
am
sure
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
we
submit
that
the
states
here
are
not
stand-ins
for
the
individual
tax
payers,
that
they
are
suing
in
their
own
right,
that
under
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution,
that
the
supreme
court
is
the
proper
forum,
that
this
section
contemplated
that
one
state
should
not
be
compelled
to
go
into
the
jurisdiction
of
another
state
to
seek
a
solution.
therefore,
the
new
hampshire
courts
or
administrative
agencies
are
not
the
appropriate
forum
and
in
reference
to
that
retaliation,
we
feel
that
the
decisions
are
clear,
that
the
policy
is
against
it,
that
the
state
of
maine
should
not
try
to
visit
--
double
sense
on
its
own
tax
payers
just
to
retaliate
for
what
was
apparently
gonna
be
a
short
lived
illegal
tax
scheme.
this
court
--
the
plaintiff
states
again
did
not
--
the
fact
that
they
did
not
retaliate,
it
is
suggested
by
new
hampshire
that
we
should
be
barred.
we
submit
that
type
of
argument
really
does
not
wash.
in
texas
versus
florida,
306
u.s.
where
one
state
threatens
to
deprive
the
other
of
its
lawful
taxes,
this
creates
an
appropriate
basis
for
action
by
this
court.
in
essence
we
are
saying
that,
again
and
much
of
it
is
just
reiterating
what
has
been
said
before,
we
are
the
real
party
and
interest,
we
have
been
hurt.
the
individual
tax
payers
really
would
not
hurt
to
any
major
degree
and
if
they
did
recover,
they
would
have
to
turn
the
money
over
to
us.
and
again,
this
is
an
action
between
states.
this
is
the
appropriate
forum.
any
recovery
the
individuals
got
would
be
a
nullity.
the
plaintiff
states
could
not
have
avoided
it
without
risking
violating
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
themselves
or
the
equal
protection
class.
and
to
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
well,
then
their
tax
returns
would
have
to
be
amended
to
reflect
that
there
was
no
payment
to
another
state.
so
then
the
payment
would
have
to
made
to
maine,
massachusetts
and
vermont.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
i
believe
it
is,
mr.
justice.
to
refuse
to
allow
us
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
well,
we
need
an
injunction
to
get
an
accounting.
we
need
an
injunction
because
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
well,
they
could
do
it
on
their
own,
but
at
present
they
sent
out
a
notice
right
after
this
--
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
the
result
of
austin
was,
they
instructed
their
employers
and
their
states
to
stop
withholding
taxes
after
march
19.
however,
they
instructed
those
people
to
continue
to
make
payments
for
money
that
was
collected
prior
to
march
19.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
just
to
the
extent
that
the
money
that
was
collected
prior
to
austin,
they
are
going
to
requite
returns
to
be
made
next
year
as
i
understand
it,
on
moneys
that
are
characterized
already
as
unconstitutionally
taken
from
our
citizens.
mr.
joseph
e.
brennan
correct,
mr.
justice.
to
refuse
to
allow
us
to
file
a
complaint
based
on
these
facts
would
encourage
petty
retaliatory
action
in
the
future.
it
will
encourage
states
to
adapt
tax
laws
of
dubious
legality
in
the
knowledge
that
they
may
be
able
to
return
their
ill-gotten
gains.
on
the
other
hand
to
accept
this
complaint
would
further
the
policies
of
non-retaliation
long
articulated
by
this
court.
it
will
would
place
the
states
on
notice
that
they
must
develop
their
taxing
schemes
with
great
care.
finally,
the
court
should
not
adapt
the
rule
which
might
encourage
some
states
beset
by
immediate
physical
crisis
to
give
less
than
careful
care
in
adopting
tax
laws
which
may
be
unconstitutional.
so
we
will
urge
you
very
respectfully
to
permit
the
plaintiff
states
to
file
a
complaint.
mr.
scotch
from
vermont
has
the
other
15
minutes.
thank
you.
