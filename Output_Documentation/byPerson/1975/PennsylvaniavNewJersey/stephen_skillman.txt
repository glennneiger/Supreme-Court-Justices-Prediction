mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
an
original
action.
the
sole
issue
properly
before
the
court,
therefore,
is
whether
the
court
has
original
jurisdiction
over
this
matter.
it
is
the
position
of
new
jersey
briefly
stated
that
this
matter
does
not
lie
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court
because
the
state
of
pennsylvania
has
no
cause
of
action
against
new
jersey.
its
brief,
in
support
of
the
motion
for
leave
to
file,
relies
exclusively
upon
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
article
4
section
2
of
the
constitution.
it
is
clear
that
these
clauses
offer
protection
only
to
individuals,
in
this
case
individual
taxpayers,
and
not
the
states.
if
anyone’s
rights
under
these
clauses
have
been
violated,
it
is
the
pennsylvania
residents
who
have
paid
the
new
jersey
commuter
benefits
tax
and
not
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
nor
may
the
commonwealth
pursue
this
matter
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
as
parens
patriae.
it
has
been
suggested
by
counsel
for
pennsylvania
that
if
there
has
been
some
type
of
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
pennsylvania
that
there
has,
therefore,
been
a
trespass
of
some
sort
upon
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
no
cases
are
cited
for
this
proposition
and
its
consequences
would
be
rather
breathtaking.
this
court
has
had
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
interstate
tax
cases
coming
forth
through
the
years
not
only
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
but
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
of
course,
most
frequently
in
the
business
context,
under
the
commerce
clause.
if
this
case
comes
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court
because
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizens
of
pennsylvania
and,
therefore,
a
trespass
upon
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
how
all
the
rest
of
the
interstate
tax
cases
involving
not
just
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
but
also
the
protection
clause
and
commerce
clause
would
not
also
come
within
the
court’s
original
jurisdiction
and
greatly
expand
that
jurisdiction.
now,
there
also
is
a
significant
eleventh
amendment
aspect
to
the
attempt
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
to
bring
this
case
as
an
original
action
insofar
as
they
seek
a
judgment
for
money
damages
against
the
state
of
new
jersey.
it
is
clear
that,
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
individual
pennsylvania
taxpayers
could
not
bring
suit
in
federal
district
court
for
the
collection
of
any
retroactive
tax
benefits.
it,
therefore,
should
be
equally
clear
that
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
cannot
dress
this
matter
up
as
an
original
action
and
circumvent
the
bar
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
seek
a
money
judgment
against
the
state
of
new
jersey.
it
was
essentially
for
these
reasons.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
the
main
precedent
on
that
particular
point
is
the
case
of
virginia
v.
west
virginia
where,
at
the
time,
the
state
of
west
virginia
was
established.
there
was
an
allocation
between
the
two
states
of
the
then
existing
bonded
indebtedness
of
the
state
of
virginia.
clearly,
a
cause
of
action
of
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
court
did
recognize
that
a
money
judgment
might
be
entered
under
those
extraordinary
circumstances.
here,
however
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
believe
that
is
the
latter
of
the
two
cases
in
238.
the
other
case
is
the
south
dakota
v.
north
carolina
case
where
i
believe
over
a
sharp
dissent,
south
dakota
was
permitted
to
take
an
assignment
by
way
of
gift
of
a
bonded
indebtedness
between
certain
of
its
citizens
and
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
to
sue
under
that
but,
again,
it
was
at
the
point
that
the
completed
gift
was
made
it
was
an
obligation
between
the
state
and
the
other
state.
here,
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
clear
that
the
obligation,
if
any,
is
an
obligation
that
would
run
between
the
taxpayers
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
and
the
state
of
new
jersey.
so,
that
extraordinary
form
of
relief
is
not
available
here.
new
jersey
relies
very
heavily,
as
indicated
in
its
brief,
upon
massachusetts
v.
missouri
where
the
court
found
that
the
interstate
tax
conflict
involved
there
did
not
fall
within
its
original
jurisdiction.
the
court
specifically
held
that
no
justiciable
controversy
was
presented
by
massachusetts’
contention
that
the
missouri
taxing
authorities
had
improperly
refused
to
exempt
the
assets
of
the
estate
of
a
massachusetts
domiciliary
from
the
missouri
taxes,
a
very
similar
situation
to
the
one
we
have
here
where
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
is
claiming
that
notwithstanding
the
credit
provisions
of
its
own
laws
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
should
not
have
enacted
a
statute
which
would
bring
those
credit
provisions
in
to
play.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
under
the
travers
and
chaffer
case
that
two
states
could
impose
a
tax
upon
the
same
income,
and
i
think
what
the
court
was
referring
to
there
in
terms
of
legal
mutual
exclusivity
was
one
where
the
constitution
bars
double
taxation.
here,
we
have
not
constitutional
bar
against
double
taxation.
we
have
an
argument
that
there
may
be
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
by
virtue
of
the
imposition
of
new
jersey’s
tax
because
of
the
particular
tax
structure
of
new
jersey
but
no
inherent
or
intrinsic
constitutional
bar
against
double
taxation,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
main
response
to
it.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
partly
on
that,
and
also
i
think
that
the
opinion
also
should
be
read
partly
as
an
attempt
to
explain
what
the
court
had
held
only
a
few
months
before
in
texas
v.
florida
where
they
had
entertained
an
original
action
in
a
case
involving
five
different
states
seeking
to
tax
the
estate
of
a
single
dissident,
and
i
think
that
the
mutual
exclusivity
also
was
meant
to
deal
with
that
problem
and
to
try
and
limit
the
parameters
of
that
rather
unusual
case
which
justice
frankfurter
in
dissenting
had
expressed
fear
might
greatly
expand
the
number
of
original
actions
being
brought
before
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
green,
i
think
is
the
name.
it
is
the
name
that
comes
to
mind.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
certainly
pennsylvania’s
claim,
yes.
it
is
true
and
recognized
that
the
constitutional
claims
which
pennsylvania
seeks
to
advance
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
would,
if
sustained
by
this
court,
result
in
an
increase
in
the
tax
revenues
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
but
this
would
be
equally
true
in
almost
any
case
in
which
a
state
taxation
provision
were
declared
invalid
because
credits
and
deductions
for
taxes
paid
to
other
taxing
authorities
are
so
common
place
in
the
taxing
schemes
of
all
states
that
this
would
be
a
very
frequently
consequence
of
any
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
of
a
tax.
so,
again,
if
this
is
a
foundation
for
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
proceeding
directly
against
the
state
of
new
jersey,
the
same
jurisdictional
principle
would
extend
to
the
great
majority
of
interstate
tax
disputes
that
come
before
the
court,
that
have
come
before
the
court,
through
the
years
and
with
a
few
unusual
exceptions
of
massachusetts
v.
missouri
and
texas
v.
florida
have
been
brought
by
the
individual
taxpayers
who
claim
that
their
individual
constitutional
rights
had
been
violated.
now,
while
pennsylvania’s
proposed
complaint
only
mentions
the
equal
protection
and
privileges
and
immunities
clauses,
their
supporting
brief
refers
to
the
water
diversion
and
escheat
cases
where
the
court
has
fashioned
what
is
called
a
federal
common
law
in
its
role
as
arbitrar
of
interstate
disputes.
the
short
answer
to
pennsylvania’s
reliance
upon
those
cases,
i
think
i
have
already
given,
and
that
is
that
neither
austin
v.
new
hampshire
nor
any
other
state
tax
case
with
a
possible
exception
of
texas
v.
florida
has
been
decided
on
that
type
of
a
basis.
however,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
these
cases
were
the
appropriate
jurisdictional
framework
for
resolving
this
matter,
we
would
ask
that
the
mater
on
its
merits
also
be
treated
as
an
interstate
dispute
to
be
resolved
in
accordance
with
principles
of
federal
common
law.
in
other
words—
mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
if
i
may
upon
the
presentation
and
argument
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
i
think
that
the
most
salient
feature
of
that
presentation
is
that
the
commonwealth
relies
upon
the
water
diversion,
escheat
cases
and
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
fashioned
a
general
federal
common
law
in
its
role
as
arbitrar
between
the
states
in
the
federal
system.
however,
having
established,
as
they
conceive
it,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
under
these
cases
they
then
abandon
them
and
on
the
merits
instead
of
relying
upon
principles
comparable
to
those
in
the
water
diversion
cases
or
asking
the
court
to
fashion
principles
similar
to
those
in
the
water
diversion
or
escheat
cases.
on
the
merits,
they
then
turn
around
and
ask
the
court
to
consider
this
case
as
one
involving
denial
of
constitutional
rights
of
individual
taxpayers
of
the
commonwealth.
the
state
of
new
jersey
would
have
no
objection
to
the
court
entertaining
under
its
original
jurisdiction,
this
matter
under
principles
comparable
to
those
that
have
been
fashioned
in
the
water
diversion
or
escheat
case.
it
would
require
rewriting
of
a
good
deal
of
constitutional
history
since
these
cases
have
previously,
with
one
or
two
exceptions,
been
considered
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
and
equal
protection
and
commerce
clause
as
applicable
to
taxpayers,
but
new
jersey
would
have
no
objection
to
this
area
of
interstate
tax
disputes
being
reconsidered
under
those
principles
and
under
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
stephen
skillman
at
least
to
the
extent
that
those
cases
properly
may
be
viewed
as
involving
a
fight
between
the
states
as
distinguished
from
essentially
fights
between
taxpayers
which,
again,
goes
back
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
that
is
the
problem
that
the
commonwealth
has
and
it
is
seeking
to
proceed
in
that
fashion.
all
we
are
saying
at
this
point
is
that
we
are
asking
them
to
be
consistent.
if
they
are
asking
the
court
to
entertain
original
jurisdiction
under
the
analogy
of
these
other
cases,
then
we
would
ask
that
the
merits
also
be
considered
under
the
analogy
of
those
cases
and
we
would
urge
that
if
the
case
were
so
considered,
and
i
am
stating
this
in
a
hypothetical
really
justices,
that
if
the
case
were
considered,
the
state
of
new
jersey
would
have
a
very
persuasive
case.
there
is
a
tremendous
outflow
of
money
from
new
jersey
residents
to
the
states
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
in
a
very
small
inflow
of
money
under
the
statutes
that
are
under
the
statute
that
is
involved
in
this
case
and
in
the
comparable
statute
that
is
applicable
to
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
are
no
such
taxes
comparable
to
those
involved
here
applicable
to
delaware
and
maryland.
there
is
a
comparable
tax
under
a
different
tax
statute
applicable
to
the
state
of
new
york.
so,
it
would
be
a
case
involving
certainly
the
states
of
pennsylvania
and
new
york.
mr.
stephen
skillman
on
the
jurisdictional
point?
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
this
plaintiff
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action?
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
i
definitely
we
would
be
making
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
is
a
brief
in
opposition
to
their
motion
for
leave
to
file,
but
i
do
not
think—
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
have
not
filed
an
answer.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
right.
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
has
not
been
acted
upon.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
would
certainly
depend
on
what
the
court
said
as
to
pennsylvania’s
status.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
that
we
would
give
a
series
of
responses
in
the
disjunctive.
i
think
that
the
first
response
we
would
give
would
be
comparable
to
the
one
that
we
have
already
have
given.
mr.
stephen
skillman
pennsylvania
has
no
cause
of
action.
i
think
that
we
would
have
to,
in
order
to
cover
ourselves
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
also
argue
on
the
merits
and
distinguish
the
new
jersey
situation
from
the
new
hampshire
situation
involved
in
austin
just
on
the
contingency
that
the
court
might—
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
once
the
court
recognize
that
pennsylvania
has
standing
to
raise
the
constitutional
contentions
of
its
taxpayers
or,
if
i
put
it
in
a
different
way,
if
this
case
were
brought
in
what
we
could
conceive
to
be
the
proper
forum
that
there
are
a
number
of
factual
issues
that
would
need
development.
mr.
stephen
skillman
one
is
how
new
jersey
goes
about
funding
the
interstate
transportation
projects
that
it
does
fund
with
the
revenues
derived
from
this
tax.
the
court
recognized
in
toomer
versus
witsell
that
differential
tax
burden
upon
residents
and
non-residents
in
a
given
tax
is
not
per
se
intrinsically,
automatically
unconstitutional,
rather
if
there
is
some
reasonable
basis
for
it,
some
reasonable
basis
for
it,
some
reasonable
justification
for
the
disparity,
it
may
be
upheld.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
think
there
is
room
for
that.
i
understood
the
inquiry
to
be
what
our
response
would
be
if
the
court
were
to
grant
leave
to
file
and
ask
us
to
address
the
merits
but
not
indicate
any
ruling
on
the
standing
question.
mr.
stephen
skillman
as
long
as
we
were
able
to
reserve
the
right
to
speak
to
the
merits
should
that
motion
be
denied.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes
but,
as
i
say,
i
think
we
would
cover
that
in
the
disjunctive,
first
of
all,
as
to
pennsylvania’s
claim
of
its
own
which
i
think
would
be
saying
essentially
the
same
things
we
are
saying
now
but--
mr.
stephen
skillman
and
we
would
have
a
number
of
factual
issues.
first
of
all,
as
to
the
allocation
of
the
revenues.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
it
is
still
trying.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
they
may
eventually
come
and
it
would
be
a
very—
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
new
jersey
would
certainly
have
to
reconsider
its
position
on
this
tax
very
substantially.
mr.
stephen
skillman
new
jersey
has
been
striving
for
the
enactment
of
an
income
tax
for
a
long
time,
so
it
would
be
highly
speculative
as
to
what
the
consequence
of
that
would
be.
as
to
pennsylvania’s
granting
of
the
credit
in
this
situation,
and
i
do
not
want
to
go
into
the
merits
further
than
i
really
should
but
i
should
just
note,
that
this
was
not
something
that
new
jersey
conjured
up
in
the
middle
of
night
and
did
without
consultation
with
pennsylvania
before
this
tax
was
enacted,
and
it
was
enacted
right
on
the
same
time
that
pennsylvania
enacted
its
income
tax.
there
were
discussions
in
a
conference
between
the
governors
of
the
respective
states,
their
personal
counsel,
and
the
attorney
generals
of
those
states.
so
this
is
not,
at
least
it
was
not
initially,
the
type
of
conflict
or
attempt
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
raid
pennsylvania
tax
revenues
that
might
have
been
portrayed
and,
again,
that
would
be
another
area
that
factually
would
have
to
be
explored
if
the
court
were
to
reject
our
contention
that
pennsylvania
does
not
have
standing
to
pursue
this
matter
on
behalf
of
its
taxpayers.
thank
you.
