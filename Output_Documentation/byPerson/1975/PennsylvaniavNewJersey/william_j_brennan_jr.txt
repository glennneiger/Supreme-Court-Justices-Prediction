justice
jr.
while
counting,
mr.
skillman,
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
and
we
were
to
grant
the
motion
for
leave
to
file,
what
follows
in
this
case?
what
kind
of
an
answer
can
you
give
us
that
you
have
not
already
given
us
in
resisting
the
motion
for
leave
to
file?
justice
jr.
the
bottom
line
is
the
motion
is
granted.
let
us
say
that
is
the
only
line.
that
is
all
we
do.
justice
jr.
just
an
order,
then
what
happens?
justice
jr.
at
least
with
all
the
arguments
below,
would
there
be
any
role
for
a
master
to
play,
for
example,
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
jr.
you
would?
justice
jr.
can
you
suggest
what
they
are?
justice
jr.
and
it
would
be
only
if
you
lost
out
on
all
those
motions,
after
all
the
pleadings
and
then
we
get
to
the
point
where
we
have
to
decide
what
point
of
action.
justice
jr.
new
jersey
still
does
not
have
an
income
tax,
does
it?
justice
jr.
it
is
trying
awfully
hard,
but
rather
unsuccessful.
justice
jr.
well
i
gather
that
would
be
as
to
earnings
up
to
march
19?
