harry
a.

mr.
silver,
somewhere
in
your
argument,
would
you
refer
to
massachusetts
against
missouri?
this
is
heavily
relied
upon
by
new
jersey
and
not
cited
in
your
brief.
i
want
to
be
sure,
i
know
your
answer
to
that.
it
does
not
have
to
be
now.
whenever
you
get
to
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
part
of
the
individual
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
eat
into
that
bounty?
can
they
get
it
back?
justice
blackmun
if
they
kept
their
tax
back
in
new
jersey,
is
that
not
tax
come
in
pennsylvania
when
they
get
it
back.
justice
blackmun
there
will
be
the
statute
of
limitations
all
over
that.
justice
blackmun
it
was
the
hetty
brown
estate
or
something.
hetty-somebody,
was
it
not?
hetty
green?
justice
blackmun
could
you
not
change
your
law?
justice
blackmun
i
am
just
arguing
my
dissent
and
i
was
alone
so
[laughter]
do
not
be
concerned
about
it.
justice
blackmun
what
was
the
result
of
austin?
justice
blackmun
mr.
scotch,
i
do
not
follow
you
on
the
doubling
of
the
tax.
i
thought
new
hampshire
had
a
credit
for
that,
am
i
in
error?
justice
blackmun
well,
what
is
the
real
reason
in
texas
against
florida
that
the
combined
asserted
tax
by
all
of
the
states
exceeded
the
--
justice
blackmun
--timely
--
timely
this
court
took
jurisdiction?
justice
blackmun
it
is
a
long,
slow
road,
even
there?
justice
blackmun
i
guess
my
problem
and
i
would
not
repeat
it
anymore,
i
fail
to
see
the
doubling
of
the
tax
and
it
is
certainly
was
not
true
in
austin
against
new
hampshire?
justice
blackmun
again
my
difficulty
basically
is
to
see
--
to
conclude
that
new
hampshire
was
such
a
rascal
always?
