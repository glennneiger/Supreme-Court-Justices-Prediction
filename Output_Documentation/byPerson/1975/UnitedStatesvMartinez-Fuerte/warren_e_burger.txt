chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
74-1560,
united
states
against
martinez-fuerte
and
75-5387,
a
consolidated
case.
mr.
bennett
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bennett
as
it
goes
you
would
agree
that
precisely
at
the
border
all
of
the
things
that
we
have
done
here
could
be
done.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
issue
is
the
distance,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
statements
a
few
minutes
ago
mr.
bennett,
you
said
something
to
the
effect
that
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
car
have
been
recently
in
mexico
or
had
come
from
mexico.
now,
suppose
there
were
something
to
indicate
that
had
probably
just
been
in
mexico
what
effect
would
you
say
that
would
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
suppose
on
field
or
somewhere
on
the
car
was
a
sticker
about
some
rodeo
that
had
just
been
completed
the
day
before
with
as
an
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
that
sticker
was
a
bright
orange
which
the
toll
guards
could
recognize
at
any
distance
of
100
feet
more
or
less.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
pursue
that
though.
suppose
on
every
car
that
came
by
the
precise
border,
a
great,
large
bunch,
piece
papers,
because
your
hand
would
be
pasted
on
the
windshield
and
the
law
would
require,
regulations
would
require
you
to
keep
that
on
your
car
for
48
hours
after
you
come
across
the
border
from
mexico,
every
car
that
pass
the
border,
anything
that
unconstitutional
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
then
route
these
cars
with
the
orange
sticker
on
them
for
inspection,
65
miles
north
of
the
border?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
get
back
to
orange,
bright
orange
sticker
the
color
of
this
pen,
with
that
bright
orange
sticker
then
you
say
as
far
as
your
concern
there
would
be
no
constitutional
barrier
to
stopping
every
car
that
carried
that
sticker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
48
hours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
if
after
48
hours
the
driver
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
take
it
off,
which
on
my
hypothetical
regulation,
you
would
be
permitted
to
do.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
bennett.
mr.
evans.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
you
agree
with
mr.
bennett
that
if
there
is
something
to
indicate
the
car
has
just
come
from
mexico
that
there
is
suspicion
that
would
support
a
stop?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
people
cross
the
border
on
foot.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
one
of
the
factors
is
time.
there
was
a
period
shown
by
one
of
the
records
in
one
of
the
cases
here
where
they
stopped
every
car
crossing
the
border
and
it
became
an
international
incident
with
mexico
protesting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
employers
on
the
american
side
protest
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
anywhere
show
any
current
estimate
as
to
the
number
of
illegal
aliens
in
the
country.
some
of
your
prior
cases
have
reflected
the
ten
or
eleven
million
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
evans.
mr.
sevilla?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
was
the
illegal
passenger
in
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel
you
should
read
some
the
petitions
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
you
would
find
that
your
statement
is
not
supportive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
referred
to
something
about
this
committee
which
had
not
met
for
seven
years
and
it
is
now
going
to
meet.
is
that
to
consider
the
legislation
that
relates
to
making
it
a
criminal
act
to
employ
an
illegal
alien
knowingly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
has
not
anything
to
do
with
the
fences
on
the
other
deficiencies
in
our
boarder
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
evans
you
have
just
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
evans.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
