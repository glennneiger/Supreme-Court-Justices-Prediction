mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
involve
four
separate
prosecutions
in
addition
to
the
one
involving
mr.
sifuentes
involving
a
stop
at
the
sarita
checkpoint
in
texas.
there
were
three
separate
cases
growing
out
of
three
stops
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
which
is
the
same
checkpoint
that
was
involved
in
last
year’s
ortiz
decision.
like
the
sarita
checkpoint
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
is
60
or
more
miles
from
the
--
air
miles
from
the
border.
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
as
you
will
probably
recall
as
on
interstate
five
between
san
diego
and
los
angeles.
each
of
them
is
operated
essentially
around
the
clock
except
where
weather
or
manpower
prohibits
or
in
the
case
of
san
clemente
if
the
traffic
gets
too
heavy
to
be
controlled
protectively.
and,
in
each
of
the
cases
here
each
of
the
four
cases,
illegal
aliens
were
discovered
riding
in
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
vehicles
that
were
stopped.
in
one
of
the
cases
involved
from
the
san
clemente
checkpoint,
the
officers
after
discovering
the
illegal
aliens
in
the
passenger
compartment
searched
the
trunk
of
the
automobile
and
found
additional
aliens.
the
broad
issue
in
all
four
of
these
cases
is
whether
border
patrol
officers
may
lawfully
stop
north
bound
vehicles
at
a
fix
checkpoint
in
the
border
area
for
the
limited
purpose
of
inquiring
about
the
citizenship
and
immigration
status
of
the
visible
occupants
in
the
absence
of
an
articulated
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
cars
carrying
aliens
who
maybe
illegally
in
the
country.
the
texas
case
and
the
california
case
is
different
two
respects,
first
with
respect
to
operating
procedure.
the
sarita
checkpoint
as
mr.
bennett
mentioned
is
customarily
operated
by
stopping
for
this
limited
inquiry
almost
everyone
who
passes
with
the
exception
of
local
residents
or
other
persons
who
the
officer
recognizes,
and
those
persons
are
simply
waived
through.
at
san
clemente
by
contrast
a
very
small
proportion
of
these
passing
vehicles
were
actually
stopped
for
inquiry.
the
figures
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
the
parker
(ph)
case
which
you
remember
was
a
consolidated
proceeding
in
the
southern
district
of
california
concerning
all
the
checkpoints
there,
estimated
that
roughly
3%
of
the
vehicles
then
were
being
stopped.
the
current
figures
including
the
figures
under
the
warrant
that
i
will
mention
in
a
moment
during
the
period
that
is
involved
here
san
clemente
indicated
the
percentage
was
even
smaller
perhaps
one-half
of
one
percent.
at
san
clemente
unlike
the
other
checkpoints
in
the
border
patrol’s
network,
the
point
officer
that
is
the
officer
who
stands
observing
traffic
as
it
approaches
does
not
ordinarily
question
the
occupants
of
the
vehicle
because
of
the
heavy
traffic
when
a
vehicle
is
to
be
stopped
for
inquiry
as
referred
off
the
highway
to
a
secondary
area
where
other
officers
make
the
inquiries.
sarita,
like
most
of
the
checkpoints
aside
from
san
clemente
as
operated
differently,
the
officers
on
the
point
generally
makes
the
stop,
and
ask
any
questions
that
he
wants
to
ask
right
in
there.
and
the
only
time
a
person
is
referred
over
to
side
of
the
highway
is
if
the
suspicious
circumstances
warrant
further
inquiry.
the
other
difference
aside
from
operating
procedure
is
that
the
stops
at
san
clemente
were
authorized
by
a
warrant
issued
by
a
federal
magistrate
upon
showing
of
area
type
probable
cause.
there
is
no
warrant
for
the
stops
at
the
sarita
checkpoint.
in
our
view,
these
differences
between
the
two
checkpoints
should
not
produce
different
results
but
they
do
account
for
somewhat
different
arguments
addressed
to
the
two
checkpoints.
the
analytical
framework
for
these
cases,
we
think
is
drawn
from
this
court’s
decision
last
time
in
brignoni-ponce
which
also
involved
border
patrol
stops
for
inquiry
but
which
involves
stops
on
roving
patrol.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
all
the
parties
agree
that
a
checkpoint
stop
and
an
inquiry
procedure
is
although
a
seizure
under
the
forth
amendment
something
like
a
street
encounter
involving
a
brief
detention,
shorter
traditional
arrest
and
that
is
therefore
to
be
tested
under
the
general
reasonableness
requirement
of
the
forth
amendment.
and
i
think
it
is
also
fair
to
say
that
the
parties
agree
that
the
reasonableness,
the
test
of
the
reasonableness
depends
upon
a
balance
between
the
law
and
enforcement
need
to
conduct
the
particular
activity
on
the
one
hand
and
the
nature
and
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
on
the
other
hand.
the
court
in
brignoni-ponce
concluded
on
the
basis
of
precisely
such
a
balance
that
it
was
not
reasonable
to
conduct
roving
patrol
stops
in
the
absence
of
articulable
suspicion
focused
on
the
particular
vehicle
to
be
stopped.
and
the
real
question
here
again,
i
think
everyone
agrees
is
whether
the
analysis
in
brignoni-ponce
at
least
to
a
different
result
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
without
probable
cause
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
originally
there
were
four
elements
to
the
border
patrol’s
traffic
checking
operation.
all
of
which
grew
out
of
the
statute
which
authorized
them
to
make
stops
and
searches
within
a
hundred
miles
from
the
border
looking
for
aliens
and
that
what
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
what
left
and
it
is
we
think,
at
once
the
single
most
important
aspect
of
the
traffic
checking
program
and
also
but
far
the
least
intrusive
aspect.
in
our
view
the
court’s
analysis
leads
to
a
different
result
in
this
case
because
as
i
just
indicated
i
think
the
stops
involved
in
a
checkpoint
stopping
and
inquiry
procedure
is
substantially
less
intrusive
and
substantially
more
essential
to
the
effective
control
of
illegal
immigration.
as,
we
read
the
decision
in
brignoni-ponce,
the
decision
turned
essentially
on
two
controlling
considerations.
first
the
court
perceive
that
the
roving
patrol
authority
sought,
it
would
permit
border
patrol
officers
to
engage
in
unlimited
stops
anywhere
within
a
one
hundred
mile
zone
anywhere
within
a
zone
100
miles
from
the
mexican
border
which
itself
is
2,000
miles
long;
day
or
night
on
city
streets,
dessert
roads,
and
busy
highways.
every
motorist
anywhere
within
the
zone
would
be
potentially
a
subject
to
limitless
interference.
second,
the
court
can
put
it
in
the
nature
of
the
illegal
alien
traffic
was
such
that
it
tends
to
generate
articulable
grounds
for
identifying
violators
and
that
the
requirement
of
reasonable
suspicion
for
roving
patrol
stops
will
allow
the
government
an
adequate
opportunity
to
carry
out
its
objective
of
protecting
the
public
interest.
the
court
in
short
and
so
stated,
was
not
convinced
that
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
required
the
degree
of
interference
with
lawful
traffic
that
we
believe
would
be
the
occasion
by
the
authority
that
is
sought
in
brignoni-ponce.
well,
neither
of
these
considerations
is
applicable
here.
the
authority
sought
for
checkpoint
officers
would
give
them
no
roving
mandate
to
move
about
this
zone
of
one
hundred
miles
from
the
border
to
stop
any
car
that
they
happen
to
see.
strategically,
each
of
the
checkpoints
is
located
at
--
first
of
all
it
is
a
fixed
location,
it
is
not
ordinarily
mobile
some
of
them
do
move
from
one
to
another
location
but
essentially
the
same
road
and
not
--
there
is
no
roving
aspect
to
it.
the
officer
has
no
discretion
on
its
own
to
decide
where
cars
to
be
stopped
or
(inaudible).
there
is
no
authority
to
pursue
a
car
except
one
that
goes
through
a
checkpoint
without
stopping.
there
is
no
interference
here
with
city
traffic,
there
is
very
little
interference
with
community
traffic.
each
of
this
checkpoints
is
placed
strategically
almost
by
a
self-limiting
process
in
a
place
where
the
least
amount
of
interference
with
local
traffic
would
be
required
in
order
to
check
what
the
border
patrol
considers
to
be
an
essential
route
to
ensure
that
no
--
to
try
to
ensure
that
none
of
the
passing
cars
contain
aliens
who
do
not
belonging
the
country.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
by
and
large,
they
are
determined
by
relatively
high-level
border
patrol
officials
in
the
field.
there
are
nine
sectors
that
the
border
patrol
has
in
the
southwest
area
and
ordinarily
the
chief
patrol
agent
of
the
sector
will
determine
location
of
the
checkpoint.
if
it
is
a
major
checkpoint
it
is
not
established
without
consultation
with
higher
officials,
either
in
washington
or
in
the
regional
office.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
it
has
been
in
operation
for
at
least
35
years.
it
was
not
always
exactly
where
it
is,
it
was
at
a
point
--
it
was
further,
i
think
further
south
but
it
is
been
at
its
present
location
for
somewhat
shorter
time,
but
there
is
always,
in
fact
always
been
a
checkpoint
if
that
location
since
around
1940.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
on
other
the
roads?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
because
other
roads
are
covered
as
well,
at
least
that
is
the
aim
of
the
of
the
border
patrol
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
by
the
checkpoints,
by
the
checkpoints.
the
aim
is
to
cover
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
three
major
roads
leading
out
of
the
border
in
that
area.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
are
essentially
three
roads
out
and
there
are
checkpoints.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
same
is
true,
i
should
add
of
the
california
areas.
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
is
on
the
major
interstate
highway
but
there
are
also
checkpoints
on
the
routes
that
might
be
used
to
avoid
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
in
short
on
this
question
of
the
scope
of
the
discretion
given
the
officers
to
initiate
encounters,
the
degree
of
the
potential
interference
with
lawful
traffic
that
would
be
occasioned
by
permitting
these
stops
at
checkpoints
is
substantially
reduced
over
that,
that
the
court
thought
would
be
involved
in
roving
patrol
situation.
it
is
true
that
the
officer
would
retain
discretion
at
the
checkpoint
particularly
at
checkpoints
where
the
traffic
is
heavy
as
at
san
clemente
to
select
certain
cars
for
the
inquiry
but
there
is
no
discretion
as
there
was
in
ortiz
to
select
cars
for
search
randomly.
of
course
a
car
could
be
searched
if
probable
cause
developed
but
there
is
no
authority
claimed
here
to
make
that
kind
of
invasion.
there
is
in
effect
no
substantial
invasion
of
privacy
which
is
what
the
court
referred
to
in
ortiz
is
being
involved
in
a
search
of
a
vehicle’s
trunk.
brignoni
recognized
that
the
intrusion
occasioned
by
a
stop
and
inquiry
is
minimal,
it
is
modest.
what
was
significant
in
brignoni
was
the
extent
of
the
potential
interference
of
the
lawful
traffic
and
not
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
which
is
not
trivial,
it
is
certainly
very
limited.
moreover,
i
should
mention
although
i
do
not
know
if
this
is
necessarily
controlling
but
it
adds
to
the
nature
of
the
kind
of
interference
that
is
involved
that
i
think
most
people
would
feel
somewhat
less
frightened
or
less
concerned
about
stopping
at
a
regular
checkpoint
where
their
floodlights
have
slipped.
it
is
on
a
--
usually
on
a
fairly
large
highway,
there
are
other
people
traveling
through.
there
is
no
one
is
being
pulled
over
to
the
side
of
the
road
by
a
flashing
red
light
from
behind
with
the
siren.
and,
to
a
certain
extent
i
think
that
minimizes
the
--
it
might
otherwise
be
viewed
to
some
peoples
as
the
offensive
aspect
of
the
operation.
but
even
more
important
in
our
view
is
not
the
intrusiveness
which
we
think
--
i
think
it
is
incontestable
as
relatively
slight
but
the
controlling
consideration
in
our
view
is
that
the
checkpoint
officer
unlike
a
roving
patrol
officer
simply
is
seldom
in
a
position
because
of
the
nature
of
the
operation
to
observe
a
vehicle
for
a
long
enough
period
or
close
enough
before
a
stop
to
see
suspicious
signs
suggesting
illegal
activity.
a
roving
patrol
officer
can
follow
a
vehicle
for
as
long
as
he
believed
is
necessary
or
to
determine
whether
to
make
a
stop
on
the
basis
of
articulated
suspicion.
but
a
checkpoint
officer
has
only
a
brief
second
or
two
look
at
an
oncoming
car
and
the
decision
simply
cannot,
in
most
instances,
be
made
that
there
something
is
suspicious
about
the
car.
and
i
should
mention,
i
think
it
is
quite
significant
that
our
california
respondents
concede
this
in
their
brief.
they
say
that
in
a
second
or
two
available
to
an
officer
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
be
able
to
find
anything
about
a
car
that
would
rise
the
a
level
of
reasonable
suspicion.
now,
at
most
of
these
checkpoints,
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
stops
are
made
on
everybody.
at
san
clemente
there
is
a
very
strong
effort
to
avoid
interference
with
the
many
thousand
of
cars
that
pass
through
the
checkpoint
and
the
effort
is
made
there
to
select
out
those
who
seem
to
be
somehow
well
worthy
of
--
excuse
me
--
of
further
inquiry.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
about
midway,
and
it
is
has
been
the
baca
court
found
that
it
was
at
the
point
of
lowest
traffic
volume
anywhere
on
that
road
between
the
two
cities.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
absolutely
and
by
far
the
highest
traffic
density
of
any
of
the
border
patrol
checkpoints.
the
effort
is
made
there
to
try
to
select
out
those
that
warrant
inquiry.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
it
is
to
a
limited
extent
but
the
officers,
by
the
nature
of
things,
do
not
want
to
waste
their
time
and
do
not
want
waste
the
time
of
travelers
and
their
effort
is
to
try
to
identify
which
cars
for
one
reason
or
another
looks
suspicious
to
them.
now,
to
stay
that
it
does
not
mean
that
there
necessarily
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
that
it
may
not
rise
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
is
right.
they
are
trained
and
many
of
them
are
very
experienced
and
they
tend
to
call
the
six
sense.
i
think
in
most
instances
it
could
be
articulated.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
it
is
necessary
enters
into
it.
i
do
not
think
--
the
record
shows
in
the
baca
case
that
that
is
not
a
controlling
consideration
in
any
case
but
i
think
it
would
the
front
common
sense
to
say
that
–
if
they
are
looking
for
illegal
mexican
aliens.
they
should
ignore
the
facial
features
of
the
occupants
of
the
vehicle.
but
the
effort
is
made
to
separate
out
the
ones,
in
their
experience,
lead
them
to
think
maybe
there
is
something
wrong
with
that
car.
sometimes
it
is
articulable
sometimes
may
not
be,
i
suspected
the
most
instances
if
they
were
force
to
articulate,
they
can
articulate
it.
but
first
of
all
i
am
not
sure
that
would
rise
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion,
certainly
it
would
not
rise
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
interpreted
that
phrase.
and
there
is
a
sense,
i
suppose,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
sixth
sense
that
the
officers
claim
to
be
exercising
that
they
can
just
tell
but
they
can
just
tell
but
they
can
not
tell
why
they
referred
all
this,
it
is
part
of
we
are
wanted
further
inquiry.
and,
i
think
it
also
should
be
said
that
although
that
randomness
is
placed
less
a
part
of
these
checkpoints
just
because
of
the
volume
traffic
and
there
is
a
sense
that
there
ought
to
be
some
risk
to
any
even
in
the
most
well
disguised
operation.
there
ought
to
be
some
risk
of
apprehension
and
detection
there
and
to
a
certain
extent
i
suppose
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
randomness
that
goes
into
the
stops
and
particularly
if
the
traffic
is
light
then
they
stop
a
higher
proportion
of
the
cars
and
even
though
they
might
not
believe
that
the
particular
car
they
are
stopping
is
suspicious.
now
at
the
other
checkpoints
as
i
have
said
the
practice
has
been
stopped
virtually
all
the
cars
that
come
by
are
baring
a
little
bit
with
the
traffic
and
as
i
have
said
that
anybody
is
recognizable
as
a
local
resident
or
someone
who
eventually
travels
the
area
is
obviously
not
going
to
be
stopped.
the
point
is
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
checkpoint
operation
is
just
not,
this
is
not
a
situation
like
it
was
in
brignoni,
this
is
--
if
a
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
is
imposed
on
checkpoint
stops,
it
means
that
the
government
will
not
have
an
adequate
ability
to
enforce
the
law
at
this
checkpoints.
they
will
not
be
able
to
carry
out
the
responsibilities
and
protect
the
public
interest.
and
i
think
then
the
lightly
consequence
of
a
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
would
be
that
the
checkpoints
will
have
to
be
closed
out
because
they
simply
could
not
be
operated
in
any
effective
way.
now,
one
of
the
amicus
brief
suggest
that
the
border
patrol
has
not
tried
to
using
spotter
vehicles
on
either
side
or
spotters
of
some
sort
to
alert
checkpoint
officer
if
something
suspicious
maybe
coming
up
but
i
really
wonder
if
that
is
less
intrusive,
i
mean
if
you
can
picture
a
line
of
border
patrol
vehicles
waiting
a
mile
down
the
road
from
the
checkpoint
and
falling
into
place
behind
each
approaching
vehicle
and
looking
at
it
and
seeing
whether
suspicious
then
alerting
the
officer
to
stop
it.
it
is
seems
to
me
that
is
much
more
intrusive
than
a
brief
stop
with
a
question
or
two
about
the
citizenship
of
the
occupants
than
the
risk
to
have
a
car
riding
along
side
of
you
for
a
mile,
i
think
that
would
offend
most
people
a
lot
more
than
a
stop.
and,
what
is
the
magic
of
a
stop,
i
do
not
know
what
it
is,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
itself
but
in
opinion
that
i
believe
judge
hufstedler
(ph)
that
was
on
the
panel
that
diverting
a
car
slowing
it
down
to
a
short
for
–
to
a
slow
speed
is
not
a
constitutional
violation
of
any
sort.
the
name
of
that
case
is
united
states
against
evans
quite
appropriately.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
what
happened
was
it
was
one
of
these
--
it
was
a
checkpoint
like
in
sarita
except
that
it
was
set
up
so
that
the
cars
would
come
off
slightly
off
the
road
and
slightly
and
pass
by
the
officer.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
at
a
slow
rate
of
speed,
i
mean
they
are
told
these
signs
generally
say
slow
and
there
are
traffic
columns
and
he
approached
in
this
vehicle
at
a
relatively
slow
rate
of
speed
and
the
officer
waved
them
on
and
as
he
went
through
the
officer
looked
down
and
saw
a
human
being
were
two
lying
on
the
floor
board
at
the
back
seat.
he
gave
a
chase
and
stopped
the
car
and
the
defendants
argument
was,
you
had
no
right
to
be
where
you
were
when
you
saw
these
person
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
car
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
hold
and
as
the
matter
of
the
fact
the
court
of
appeals
panel
in
this
case
reaffirmed
the
holding
that
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
in
diverting
cars
to
a
position
where
officers
can
see
inside
of
them
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
that
was
probable
cause
probably
but
yes
they
said
that
might
well
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion.
his
argument
was
--
he
conceded
we
had
sufficient
cause
to
make
the
stop
after
the
officer
saw
the
person
at
the
back
seat,
he
argue
that
he
was
in
the
position
that
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
united
states
against
evans
which
cited
in
our
brief
and
it
is
also
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we
conclude
from
all
of
these
that
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated
that
the
stops
at
checkpoints
ought
to
be
permitted
under
the
reasonableness
test
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
absence
of
an
articulated
particularized
suspicion
focused
on
the
vehicle
to
be
stopped.
both
the
fifth
and
the
tenth
circuits
so
held,
the
ninth
circuits
of
course
has
ruled
against
us
on
this
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
are
no
established
fixed
checkpoints
that
i
know
off.
i
think
there
is
some
traffic
checking
that
goes
on
in
the
northern
--
at
the
canadian
border
areas
but
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
am
talking
about
inland.
now,
there
is
some
traffic
checking
inland
too,
although,
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
nothing
approaching
what
goes
on,
on
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
there
are
some
decisions
out
of
other
circuits
bearing
on
some
of
these
issues.
there
was
a
second
circuit
decision
involving
a
check
of
a
board
by
a
border
patrol
officer
of
a
bus
coming
from
the
canadian
border
area
where
he
found
a
person
we
took
off
the
bus
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
if
there
was
a
petition
i
did
not
work
on
the
opposition.
i
do
not
remember
generally
if
the
petition
is
being
filed.
we
lost
the
case
and
i
cannot
see
why
anybody
would
petition
certainly
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
now,
we
recognized
that
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
a
prior
judicial
judgment
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
a
particular
operation.
they
will
bear
upon
the
reasonableness
balance
itself,
although,
we
think
that
it
is
that
the
nature
of
the
stops
are
sufficiently
non-intrusive
and
the
need
for
them
is
sufficiently
great.
but,
there
is
no
need
to
worry
about
the
non-existence
or
existence
of
a
warrant.
we
recognized
this
relevance
and
our
view
to
start
with
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
warrant
in
the
context
of
fix
checkpoints.
first
because
the
intrusion
is
so
relatively
innocuous
that
the
procedure
just
does
not
present
the
kind
of
dangers
that
the
warrant
procedures
are
designed
to
protect
against.
this
is
not
a
search
at
least
not
without
probable
cause.
there
is
no
electronic
eavesdropping
here,
i
mean
this
relatively
trivial.
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
asked
earlier
if
there
was
anything
in
the
record
indicate
the
average
length
of
the
stops.
there
is
something
in
the
record
that
the
average
length
of
the
stops
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
was
three
to
five
minutes
that
which
appears
in
the
application
for
the
warrant,
although
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
so
indicate
that
were
told
that
the
checks
–
the
stops
at
most
of
the
checkpoints
consume
total
less
than
a
minute
but
as
a
way
of
gauging
how
long
for
routine
inquires
no
longer
than
about
five
seconds
per
occupant.
so,
if
you
take
the
time
that
he
sees
the
checkpoint
from
the
time
he
leaves,
if
there
is
even
three
or
four
people
in
the
car
that
is
likely
to
be
less
than
a
minute
unless
something
suspicious
arises
that
warrants
further
investigation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
now
the
ones
who
are
referred
off
the
highway
at
san
clemente
because
of
the
referral
of
the
highway
take
a
little
longer
than
the
other
checkpoints
do.
it
may
take
three
to
five
minutes
of
the
checkpoints
if
someone
is
for
some
reason
gives
rise
to
suspicion
but
at
san
clemente
the
initial
inquiries
made
by
an
officer
at
the
secondary
area
and
so
there
is
a
necessary
referral
and
it
takes
a
little
bit
longer
but
it
not
a
very
long
delay.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
is
substantially
longer,
i
do
not
think
it
substantially
more
intrusive
in
any
event.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
it
is
longer
than
at
san
clemente
but
i
should
indicate
that
of
the
99
or
more
percent
of
the
cars
are
not
stopped
at
san
clemente
inquiry
at
least
to
some
dispute
and
it
is
continued
from
the
last
terms
cases
about
whether
the
vehicles
are
actually
stopped.
we
are
told
that
they
are
waived
through
unless
they
are
going
to
be
referred
over
unless
they
are
curious
sometimes
they
will
stop
at
the
stop
sign
even
though
the
officers
is
waving
them
on
the
stop
but
even
if
they
were
stopped
their
stop
is
instantaneous.
i
mean
the
district
court
in
baca
pleading
that
is
not
even
as
a
traffic
light
stop.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
if
that,
not
only
they
are
going
to
extract
money
from
you
at
the
checkpoint.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
well,
second
reason
why
we
think
warrants
would
be
unnecessary
in
the
context
of
a
checkpoint
stops
is
that
the
stationary
nature
and
regularized
procedure
of
the
operation
makes
it
in
a
sense
unnecessary
to
have
repeated
renewals
of
warrants
for
one
particular
checkpoint,
which
is
the
procedure
that
was
followed
for
sometime
at
san
clemente
and
many
other
checkpoints
in
the
ninth
circuit
after
the
ninth
circuit
rule
that
we
cannot
operate
them
without
warrants.
unlike
a
roving
patrol
which
in
case
i
assume
would
be
essentially
unique.
a
checkpoint
does
not
change
substantially
from
day
to
day
even
from
year
to
year
and
in
our
view
judicial
scrutiny
can
most
appropriately
awake
on
occasion
an
adversary
criminal
proceeding
where
the
reasonableness
of
its
operation
can
be
determine.
and
once
determined
one
way
or
the
other,
there
is
an
opportunity
for
appeal
by
the
either
side
and
that
is
the
ultimate
resolution
of
that
checkpoint
would
stand.
i
mean
that
would
be
the
end
of
anything
you
know
that
checkpoint
was
reasonable
without
concluding
other
people
from
challenging
it
or
you
would
know
that
it
was
unreasonable
in
which
case
the
government
would
have
no
choice
but
to
close
it
down.
but
it
is
a
single
spot
it
is
not
a
unique
special
situation
requiring
the
advance
approval
of
a
judge
because
each
time
it
becomes
the
judge
for
approval,
and
the
judge
says
(inaudible)
this
last
week,
no
reason
to
go
through
this
all
again.
i
think
that
minimizes
at
least
the
need
for
a
warrant
of
the
kind
that
mr.
justice
powell
suggested
in
the
concurring
opinion
on
almeida-sanchez.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
and
sifuentes
was
a
texas
case
and
no
warrant.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
there
was
a
warrant
and
as
i
say
the
warrants
in
ninth
circuit
were
obtained
because
the
ninth
circuit
ruled,
we
could
not
operate
the
checkpoints
without
warrants
and
so
we
began
seeking
warrants
and
they
were
granted,
generally
without
to
much
difficulty
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
moreover
the
warrant
procedure
in
the
context
of
the
checkpoints
we
think
has
substantial
problems
of
workability,
and
again
in
this
very
central
aspect
of
our
case
i
think
the
california
respondents
--
although
they
are
not
--
well
the
california
respondents
in
effect
concede
that
the
beyond
workable
or
at
least
it
would
be
very
difficult.
they
say
there
is
a
price
to
be
paid
but
i
think
it
enters
into
the
question
whether
indeed
it
should
be
paid.
first
of
all
there
is
a
problem
of
coordination,
all
of
these
checkpoints
are
--
almost
all
of
these
checkpoints
are
correlated
with
others
that
are
nearby
as
i
was
responding
to
mr.
justice
marshall
before.
a
checkpoint
does
not
stand
on
its
own
it
is
coordinated
with
other
checkpoints
in
the
area
so
that
there
is
no
easy
way
for
a
personal
intent
on
violating
the
immigration
laws
of
avoiding
detection.
it
does
not
always
work
but
that
is
the
aim
and
if
one
magistrate
says
the
checkpoint
a
is
okay
but
the
other
magistrate
says
checkpoint
b
is
no
good
well
that
is
just
like
having
no
checkpoint
at
all
because
everybody
is
going
to
up
where
checkpoint
b
is
located.
the
second
thing
is
the
need
for
flexibility.
the
checkpoints
we
have
here
do
not
face
this
problem
because
these
are
permanent
checkpoint
in
a
sense
they
are
operated
roughly
around
the
clock
all
of
year
and
there
is
no
question
about
their
operation
except
where
weather
is
bad
or
manpower
is
short.
but
there
are
other
checkpoints
that
can
not
be
operated
all
the
time
or
there
is
no
need
to
operate
them
all
the
time
and
experience
has
shown
that
border
patrol
agents,
the
supervisory
officials
need
just
have
that
flexibility
to
establish
a
checkpoint
that
perhaps
has
not
been
used
regularly.
but
the
effect
of
the
warrant
requirement
because
you
have
to
know
well
in
advance
whether
you
are
going
to
use
it,
maybe
to
limit
the
use
of
checkpoints
only
the
major
ones
which
would
in
a
long
run
serve
very
little
purpose
because
the
secondary
routes
would
then
become
flooded.
and
third,
i
think
i
mentioned
just
a
second
ago
in
this
context,
there
is
no
established
procedure
for
appellant
review
over
a
denial
of
a
warrant
and
the
government
would
have
little
recourse
if
a
magistrate
or
judge
refused
to
grant
a
warrant
and
that
happened
to
us
during
the
period
of
the
warrant
procedure
in
the
ninth
circuit.
we
had
several
warrants
denied
and
we
were
unable
to
do
anything
about
the
checkpoint
have
to
be
shut
down.
of
course
if
the
ruling
would
occur
in
an
adversary
proceeding
there
will
be
no
question
about
review.
well,
if
we
are
wrong
about
the
need
for
a
warrant
and
we
need
one
that
would
affect
only
the
texas
case.
we
can
only
operate
these
checkpoints
with
warrants
the
texas
case
is
looser
but
the
san
clemente
stops
were
authorized
in
advanced
by
a
warrant.
precisely
i
think
of
the
sort
that
was
envisioned
by
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
on
almeida
sanchez.
we
think
it
was
superfluous,
but
there
was
a
prior
judicial
approval
of
the
very
operation
that
led
to
the
stops
and
inquiries
and
subsequent
arrest
in
these
cases
in
california.
and,
we
think
this
represents
an
additional
basis
for
concluding
the
stops
here
was
reasonable.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
and
our
california
respondents
would
give
the
warrant
no
weight
because
in
their
view
it
is
unlawfully
broad,
but
their
argument
has
that
kind
of
catch-22
flavor
about
it
because
they
argue
on
the
one
hand
that
you
need
reasonable
suspicion
to
make
a
stop
and
if
you
do
not
have
reasonable
suspicion
then
it
sis
essential
that
you
have
a
warrant?
but
then
they
say,
in
order
to
get
a
warrant
you
have
to
have
probable
cause.
what
this
is
really
saying
i
think
is
as
the
court
stated
in
wyman
against
james,
a
warrant
is
just
out
of
place
here
but
if
we
have
lost
that
point
the
warrant
is
in
place
here,
this
is
the
only
kind
of
warrant
that
can
be
issued.
it
requires
an
analysis
and
a
weighing
of
the
basic
agency
decision
to
conduct
the
checkpoint.
now,
mr.
justice
powell’s
suggestion
in
this
concurring
opinion
on
almeida-sanchez
was
for
a
warrant
that
would
authorize
roving
patrol
searches
over
a
precisely
the
kind
of
area
that
was
involved
in
brignoni-ponce
although
a
magistrate
would
in
advance
limit
the
area.
and
the
four
dissenting
justices
although
disagreeing
as
to
the
need
for
the
warrant
agreed
that
would
be
consistent
with
fourth
amendment
requirements.
this
warrant
is
substantially
more
limited
authorizing
only
stops
and
not
searches
and
limited
only
to
a
specific
location
and
not
to
any
roving
extended
aspects.
it
is
true
that
the
focus
of
a
warrant
of
this
sort
is
necessarily
less
precise
than
it
would
be
the
case
for
more
conventional
crime
but
the
special
problems
of
enforcement
in
this
respect
is
they
are
detailed
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion.
we
think
justifies
an
unconventional
solution
and
in
this
context
i
think
we
can,
one
can
say
that
a
warrant
is
sufficiently
precise
if
it
identifies
the
place
where
the
operation
is
to
take
place,
remembering
it
all
times
here
that
we
are
talking
about
stops
and
brief
inquiries.
that
it
identifies
the
purpose
and
the
scope
of
the
operation.
and
then,
it
is
narrowly
as
it
is
feasible
it
limits
the
class
of
vehicles
to
be
subjected
to
it
in
this
case,
the
class
of
northbound
vehicles
in
interstate
state
five
which
is
not
a
very
narrow
class,
but
it
is
as
narrow
as
it
is
feasible.
in
any
event
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
figure
of
10
million
which
i
think
is
an
accurate
reflection
of
the
number
of
vehicles
that
pass
that
point
annually
although
the
checkpoint
is
operated
only
about
60%
of
the
time
or
perhaps
a
little
bit
less
and
the
figures
would
indicate
that
only
something
less
than
half
of
that
actually
pass
through
during
a
period
where
the
checkpoint
is
in
operation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
is
a
close
in
the
sense
that
it
is
somewhat
general,
but
it
is
not
close
in
the
sense
of
what
is
being
authorized.
there
is
no
search
being
authorized
here,
no
books
and
papers
are
being
rummaged
through.
this
is
a
very
limited
operation
as
i
indicated
there.
most
of
the
people
are
not
even
affected
substantially;
they
just
go
right
through.
even
if
they
do
make
a
brief
pleading
stop
and
the
small
proportions
who
are
subjected
to
a
stop
at
secondary
for
inquiry
are
not
subjected
any
substantial
invasion
to
their
privacy.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
ordinarily
is
but
there
are
manpower
shortages
or
whatever
that
sometimes
preclude
its
operation
around
the
clock.
i
think
if
there
were
no
manpower
problems
and
if
the
weather
stayed
good
at
all
times
and
the
traffic
never
got
heavy
as
it
does
frequently
at
that
point
they
would
operate
around
the
clock.
they
would
like
too,
that
is
their
aim
but
there
are
various
reasons
why
it
can
not
always
be
done.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
is
but
you
see
to
a
certain
extent
mr.
justice
blackmun
it
is
deterrent
and
shutting
it
down
for
a
few
hours
is
not
going
to
decrease
substantially
its
deterrent
value,
because
the
persons
who
are
intend
to
travel
that
way
illegally
do
not
know
necessarily
when
it
is
down.
now,
i
think
a
brief
reflects
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
developed
in
the
consolidated
proceeding
in
the
southern
district
of
california
that
there
were
scouting
operation,
there
were
what
the
court
have
held
load
houses
where
illegal
aliens
are
kept
until
the
check
--
until
the
scout
is
told,
has
called
back
and
say
the
checkpoint
is
down.
but
there
are
in
a
ways
of
meeting
that
problem
too
and
they
would
frequently
open
the
checkpoint
unexpectedly
after
shutting
it
down
and
catch
as
the
record
indicates
an
enormous
number
of
people
who
are
trying
to
get
through
at
that
point.
it
has
been
referred
to
by
the
border
patrol
people
that
i
have
talked
to,
it
is
really
a
game.
i
mean
it
is
like
a
chess
game,
they
are
trying
to
out
guest
their
adversary
in
effect.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
if
there
was
a
reason
to
believe
that
a
vehicle
had
just
crossed
the
border.
you
have
what
would
amount
to
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
border
search.
the
example
that
you
are
posing
to
mr.
bennett
may
not
be
a
realistic
one
mr.
chief
justice
because
if
the
car
came
through
at
a
point
where
officers
could
put
a
sticker
on
it,
it
has
been
subjected
to
an
inspection.
we
do
not
have
any
problem
with
people
to
come
through
whether
they
can
be
inspected
that
that
car
has
been
subjected
to
the
scrutiny
that
ordinarily
goes
with
coming
into
this
country.
it
is
the
people,
it
is
the
cars
that
do
not
come
through,
now
those
cars
are
usually
runs
on
this
side
of
the
border
and
their
left
in
remote
areas
where
people
who
cross
the
border
in
remote
areas
to
drive
away
and
those
cars
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
illegally,
that
is
right,
pedestrially
(ph).
do
you
know,
if
we
were
in
position
to
put
a
sticker
on
the
car
we
would
need
to
search
it
later,
because
we
already
inspected
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
in
that
event
as
i
say
if
that
were
a
problem,
if
that
were
to
be
done,
if
it
were
clear,
there
was
as
the
ninth
circuit
rules
themselves
hold.
if
there
is
a
reasonable
certainty
that
you
got
a
personal
or
vehicle
containing
things
or
persons
who
have
just
crossed
the
border
you
can
conduct
what
amounts
to
a
border
search
wherever
you
find
them.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
record
is
little
stale
at
this
point.
the
baca
hearing
at
the
district
court
in
california,
the
estimate
was
somewhat
less
than
a
million
but
their
recent
estimates
that
have
been
given
in
testimony
by
commissioner
chapman
of
the
immigration
nationalization
service
to
congress
has
indicated
that
the
current
estimate
is
closer
to
six
to
eight
million.
and
as
you
indicate
there
have
been
various
estimates
and
some
put
as
high
as
twelve
million
of
some
of
those
figures
are
reflected
in
a
report
that
the
house
judiciary
committee
made
recently
with
respect
to
legislation
dealing
with
making
it
the
crime
to
knowingly
higher
illegal
aliens.
i
would
like
to
reserve
if
i
may,
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
will
make
it
brief.
it
is
quite
misleading
to
say
that
99.9%
of
the
vehicles
are
contained
no
aliens.
99.8%
of
them
are
not
referred
over
for
--
about
99%
of
them
are
not
referred
over
for
secondary
inspection,
of
those
that
are
the
figures
under
the
warrant
at
issue
here
show
that
21%
were
in
fact
found
with
illegal
aliens
in
it.
mr.
chief
justice
on
the
status
of
the
legislation
what
used
to
be
h.r.
982,
and
the
house
has
now
been
made
up
into
a
clean
bill
called
h.r.
8713
which
was
reported
to
the
house
by
the
judiciary
committee
on
september
24,
1975
in
its
report
number
94-506.
the
senate
has
been
one
of
the
stumbling
blocks
in
this
legislation
in
the
past.
senator
eastland,
the
chairman
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee
has
recently
introduced
own
version
of
the
bill,
it
is
s3074
which,
at
section
12
and
13,
make
it
unlawful
to
knowingly
employ
illegal
aliens,
although
the
bill,
as
submitted
by
senator
eastland,
does
not
have
criminal
penalties
it
has
a
civil
penalties
structure.
