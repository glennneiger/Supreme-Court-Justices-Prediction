does

your

mr.
bennett,
you
have
mentioned
emphasized
as
i
understand
your
argument
the
intrusion
of
the
stop.
suppose
instead
of
stopping
your
client
he
have
been
brought
down
to
a
speed
let
us
say
at
five
miles
an
hour
and
he
also
had
detected
the
presence
of
these
individuals
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
back
area.
would
that
be
a
constitutional
violation?
justice

do
you
think
it

draw
a
distinction
between
a

mr.
sevilla,
i
take
if
from
what
you
have
said,
if
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
you
represented
the
non-mexican
who
had
been
subjected
only
to
the
fleeting
stop.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
the
answer
to
my
question
is
that
if
you
represented
a
non-mexican
who
had
been
stopped
for
five
seconds,
you
would
make
the
same
constitutional
argument.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no
you
--
perhaps
i
have
not
stated
the
question
correctly.
i
am
assuming
a
case
in
which
the
only
intrusion
to
use
you
with
is
a
five
seconds
detention
then
you
waved
on,
this
is
your
client,
he
is
a
non-mexican,
he
was
waved
on,
he
was
going
60
miles
an
hour
as
you
said,
he
was
brought
to
the
stop
for
five
seconds,
he
asked
you
to
represent
him.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
you
are
making
here
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
you
are
saying
in
fact
that
the
constitutional
intrusion
is
that
initial
five
second
stop
that
gives
out
officer
an
opportunity
to
take
a
look.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand.

in
74-1560
united
states
against
martinez
and
75-5387
sifuentes
against
the
united
states.
again,
we
have
two
cases
that
present
the
same
issue.
the
problem
here
arises
from
aliens
to
enter
the
united
states
illegally,
primarily
from
mexico.
the
border
with
mexico
is
almost
2000
miles
long.
there
are
several
million
aliens
illegally
in
the
country
most
of
whom
crossed
the
mexican
border
surreptitiously.
they
have
void
lawful
ports
of
entry,
cross
on
foot
at
various
points
and
rendezvous
smugglers
to
transport
them
inland.
the
border
patrol
conducts
three
kinds
of
inland
traffic
checking
operations,
roving
patrols,
temporary
checkpoints
and
permanently
located
checkpoints.
we
are
concerned
today
with
the
operation
of
two
permanent
checkpoints,
one
located
on
a
principal
highway
in
california
and
the
other
on
important
highway
in
texas.
the
defendants
in
these
cases
were
stopped
for
questioning
and
aliens
were
found
in
both
vehicles.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
prohibition
against
searches
and
seizures
was
violated
by
routine
checkpoint
stops
of
vehicles
on
a
public
highway
for
the
questioning
of
occupants.
these
stops
are
made
where
there
is
neither
probable
cause
nor
any
reasonable
suspicion
in
a
legal
sense
for
leaving
the
vehicles
contain
illegal
aliens.
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
involved
in
one
of
these
cases
during
an
eight
day
period
in
1974,
146,000
vehicles
passed
the
checkpoint,
all
were
slowed
to
a
few
miles
per
hour
to
allow
for
a
fleeting
visual
inspection.
820
vehicles
were
selected
and
referred
to
a
secondary
area
for
routine
questioning
as
to
citizenship.
of
the
820
vehicles
so
selected,
171
were
found
to
be
transporting
a
total
of
725
deportable
aliens.
the
questioning
that
occurs
usually
takes
no
more
than
three
to
five
minutes.
the
stopping
of
motorist
on
highways
for
various
inquiries,
license
checks,
weight
limit
inspections,
fruit
and
vegetable
inspections
and
alike
is
familiar
to
all
motorists.
we
hold
that
stops
for
brief
questioning
routinely
conducted
at
an
official
checkpoint
wholly
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
the
intrusion
on
privacy
and
the
limitation
on
freedom
of
movement
in
these
situations
are
minimal.
the
public
interest
and
the
need
for
this
widest
law
enforcement
technique
on
the
other
hand
have
been
demonstrated
abundantly
by
the
records
in
these
cases.
accordingly
we
reverse
number
74-1560,
here
from
the
court
of
appeal
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
affirm
75-5387
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
concurred.
