justice
potter
stewart
you
are
stopped
and
then
what
happens?
then
each
car
stopped
except
those
whose
occupants
are
recognized
as
local
residents.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
it
is
a
stop
and
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
of
whom,
of
the
driver
--
and
all
the
occupants?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
that
record
that
shows
the
average
length
of
the
stop?
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
your
record.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
how
many
cars
or
what
percentage
of
the
cars
that
are
stopped
or
taken
over
to
the
secondary?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
there
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
they
make
a
one
stop
out
of
twenty?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
what
were
the
facts
in
your
case?
i
am
sure
you
are
going
to
get
to
them.
justice
potter
stewart
by
early
morning
hours
what
time
of
the
day?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
checkpoint
operates
24
hours
a
day?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
lying
down
as
if
asleep,
i
think
the
record
shows.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
decided
last
term?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
slow
down
if
i
understand,
my
brother
powellâ€™s
question.
in
your
case
it
would
have
eventuated
ultimately
in
a
stop
and
then
an
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
a
slow
down
and
just
go
through
little
bit
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
last
term
in
those
two
cases
brignoni-ponce
and
what
was
the
other,
ortiz
or
one
(inaudible)
ortiz?
it
was
settled
that
there
could
not
be
a
stop
even
for
interrogation
by
a
roving
patrol
except
upon
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
potter
stewart
but
further
settled
that
there
could
not
be
a
stop
and
search
at
a
fixed
checkpoint,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
without
the
ordinary
probable
cause
or
for
a
search
or
consents.
so,
this
is
the
soul
remaining
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happened
to
that
case?
is
that
all
--
slow
down
or
slow
speed
and
went
on?
justice
potter
stewart
at
a
slow
rate
of
speed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
from
what
they
see
there
might
arise
a
reasonable
suspicion.
is
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
was
holding?
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
potter
stewart
evans.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
would
be
the
only
three
circuits
involved,
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
checkpoints
in
the
northern
part
of
our
country?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
of
course
the
border
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
these
three
circuits
at
a
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case
here,
what
happened?
it
is
pending
or?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
i
am
thinking
about
another
similar
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
that
statistical
data
and
those
statistical
data
in
the
san
clemente
record,
because
you
keep
saying
repeating
in
your
briefs
that
the
stop
here
involves
no
more
intrusion
and
certainly
no
more
time
than
a
stop
for
a
traffic
light
or
a
stop
sign
which
is
we
know
as
matter
of
generally
seconds
less
than
a
minute.
and,
yet
the
indication
is
that
the
average
stop
is
from
three
to
five
minutes
which
is
considerably
longer,
but
do
i
understand
that
three
to
five
minute
trade
is
of
those
that
are
put
over
into
called
secondary.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
substantially
longer
than
a
stop
sign
or
a
traffic
light?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
inquiring
about
the
length
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
more
like
a
toll
booth
stop.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
again
like
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
although,
in
this
sifuentes
there
was
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
martinez-fuerte,
the
current
case?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
still
lost
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
several
million
people
a
year
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
some
on
the
same
people,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
pretty
close
to
it,
general
law
in
it,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
does
that
happen
to
every
car?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
does
that
with
every
car?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
so-called
fleeting
stop.
justice
potter
stewart
about
one
out
of
twenty?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
probably
would
not
be
in
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
kind
of
case
would
you
have?
justice
potter
stewart
all
you
would
have
is
a
plaintiff's
case.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
would
have
a
plaintiff's
case
under
beavins?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
is
a
constitutional
permissible
intrusion
walking
down
the
street
and
stopping
any
passerby
and
asking
for
his
identification?
is
that
what
happened
here
at
this
checkpoint?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
to
slow
them
down
to
ask
the
question,
do
they
not?
