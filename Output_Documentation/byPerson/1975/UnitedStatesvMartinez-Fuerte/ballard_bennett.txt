mr.
ballard
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
of
rodolfo
sifuentes
in
which
i
am
court
appointed
counsel
involved
the
question
of
whether
the
border
patrol
can
stop
a
vehicle
at
a
permanent
checkpoint
many
miles
from
the
border
for
the
purposes
of
interrogating
its
occupant
and
visually
searching
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
without
cause
or
suspicion
of
any
kind
and
also
without
a
warrant
of
any
nature.
now
the
martinez-fuerte
case
involves
the
same
question
except
in
that
case
the
checkpoint
was
operating
under
some
nature
of
a
warrant,
a
warrant
of
some
kind.
however,
the
government
may
intend
that
they
have
a
right
to
operate
these
checkpoints
to
make
these
stops
and
inflict
these
intrusions
upon
the
people
passing
without
a
warrant
and
the
fact
that
they
did
have
a
warrant
or
did
not
have
a
warrant
is
not
controlling
and
that
is
their
initial
argument
anyway.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
your
honor,
there
is
no
argument
about
that
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor.
this
could
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir.
my
checkpoint
was
approximately
70
miles
from
the
border
and
as
i
recall
and
the
checkpoint
that
i
have
in
my
case
is
near
sarita,
texas
and
you
probably
do
not
know
where
sarita,
texas
is
but
it
is
in
the
ranch
country
of
south
of
houston
between
houston
and
brownsville.
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
is
about
65
five
miles
from
the
border.
in
between
both
the
checkpoint
and
the
border
in
both
of
those
areas
there
large
metropolitan
establishment
of
course
they
have
got
san
diego
and
california
and
then
the
lower
rio
grande
valley
which
what
they
call
this
are.
we
have
a
strain
of
towns.
i
believe
we
have
got
about
320,000
people
that
live
in
this
area
between
the
border
itself
and
the
checkpoint.
mr.
ballard
bennett
your
honor,
i
would
guess
brownville
to
be
about
80,000
people.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir,
it
certainly
is.
the
highway
77
on
which
the
checkpoint
is
located
originates
in
brownville.
it
goes
from
brownsville
through
san
benito,
through
harlingen,
through
raymondville.
now,
the
rest
of
the
other
valley
cities
are
off
back
to
the
west
and
the
roads
constantly
feed
into
this
highway
77.
now
when
it
gets
to
raymondville,
a
few
miles
outside
then
it
hits
the
ranch
country
and
the
valley
is
not
really
a
valley,
it
is
an
alluvial
belt
and
they
have
a
very
great
deal
of
agriculture,
it
is
highly
intense
cultivation
of
raw
crops.
but
when
you
get
in
to
this
country
where
they
have
the
checkpoint
located,
it
is
in
the
ranch
country.
the
king
ranch
is
on
both
sides,
but
it
is
not
right
there
where
the
checkpoint
is
but
the
king
ranch
is
broken
up
into
various
divisions.
and,
there
is
one
--
several
divisions
to
the
north
and
there
is
at
least
one
or
two
to
the
south.
and,
it
is
in
a
remote
area.
now,
the
valley
is
like
a
three-neck
bottle
and
i
am
speaking
of
course
of
the
rio
grande
valley.
there
are
only
three
ways
to
get
out
of
there
by
automobile
going
north.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
the
area
that
i
am
talking
about,
this
area
where
they
have
a
lot
of
farming
and
a
lot
of
people
about
320,000
or
so,
it
consist
generally
of
four
counties.
three
counties
starting
down
at
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
and
going
up
northwest,
the
river
runs
in
a
northwest
direction.
there
would
be
three
counties
running
along
there
and
then
one
county
sits
on
top
of
cameron
county,
which
is
right
at
the
coast.
mr.
ballard
bennett
north
of
there.
now
highway
77
runs
through
cameron
county,
it
runs
through
kennedy
county,
excuse
me;
one
is
at
willacy
county
which
is
the
next
county
up.
and
then,
it
goes
on
up
into
kennedy
county
and
this
checkpoint
is
about
8/10
of
the
way
up
into
kennedy
county.
kennedy
county
is
a
huge
county
it
has
got
about
1500
square
miles
in
it.
so,
there
is
really
no
connection
between
this
checkpoint
and
the
border.
the
traffic
coming
by
there
comes
out
of
the
valley
and
there
is
no
assurance
or
whatsoever
that
any
of
these
cars
have
recently
come
across
the
border.
we
maintain
that
there
is
no
substantial
extension
between
that
stop
by
roving
patrol
and
it
stop
at
a
checkpoint.
we
feel
that
the
reasoning
of
the
brignoni-ponce
case
should
be
controlling
and
should
be
extended
to
the
checkpoint
stop.
it
is
our
contention
that
these
intrusions
can
be
characterized
and
it
is
sort
of
a
three-pronged
attack.
first
there
would
be
the
stop
itself,
now,
at
sarita,
every
car
coming
down
that
road
except
people
containing
the
local
inhabitants
are
stopped.
now,
whether
you
call
that
taking
a
man
to
custody,
a
short
of
traditional
arrest,
or
whether
you
call
it
a
seizure
or
however
you
characterize
it.
the
fact
remains
that
once
you
come
within
the
site
of
that
checkpoint
then
you
were
in
the
custody
of
the
border
patrol
agent
on
duty.
mr.
ballard
bennett
that
is
right.
mr.
ballard
bennett
the
first
thing
that
happens
is
the
agent
approaches
close
enough
to
the
car
to
be
able
to
see
down
in
that
car.
he
does
that
deliberately
for
that
purpose.
and
the
third
thing
is
an
interrogation.
mr.
ballard
bennett
all
the
occupants
and
the
driver.
now,
this
interrogation
is
open
ended.
it
can
be
simply
“are
you
all
united
states
citizens?”
“yes,
we
are
all
united
states
citizens”
or
there
is
no
regulations,
it
is
completely
in
the
discretions
of
the
border
patrol
officer
and
he
can
ask
you
why,
you
say
you
are
united
states
citizen,
“where
were
you
born?”
“well,
i
was
born
in
so
and
so.”
“where
are
you
living
now?
how
long
have
you
lived
there?
what
is
your
occupation?
where
are
you
going?
why
are
you
going
there?”
you
see,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
man’s
citizenship,
practical
anything
that
he
has
done
could
be
pertinent.
mr.
ballard
bennett
not
in
my
record.
mr.
ballard
bennett
the
only
people
that
would
know
that
would
be
the
border
patrol
and
they
did
not
offer
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
that
is
the
point,
your
honor.
that
stop,
when
you
are
stopped
you
are
there
and,
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
in
the
terry
case
in
his
concurring
opinion
was
talking
about
up
in
cleveland
when
they
ask
you
about
a
crime.
you
do
not
have
to
answer,
you
can
walk
away.
well,
you
do
not
walk
away
from
these
checkpoints.
these
men
are
there,
they
have
got
guns.
you
are
there
until
they
tell
you,
you
can
leave.
mr.
ballard
bennett
if
he
did
not
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir,
i
believe
they
would
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
they
would
just
take
you,
bring
you
back
and
question
you
about
your,
why
did
you
run
through
there
or
why
did
not
you
stop.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
i
think
he
--
the
officer
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
no
sir.
i
just
rely
on
what
i
know
is
in
common
sense,
the
officer
would
tell
him
that
it
was
his
abundance
and
he
would
keep
him
there
and
interrogate
him.
now,
whether
he
would
eventually
charge
him
with
an
offense,
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
know
that
he
would
not
continue
running
down
the
road
which
he
would
probably
what
he
wanted
to
do
when
he
started
out
on
his
trip.
people
coming
out
of
the
valley
if
they
get
far
enough
north
and
passed
this
checkpoint
or
going
a
substantial
distance
and
it
can
be
anticipated
that
they
would
like
to
get
on
their
way,
and
when
you
are
stopped
you
have
the
--
you
are
facing
the
possibility
of
being
detained
for
some
time
if
they
wanted
to
take
you
over
to
secondary
and
question.
that
is
what
happened
in
the
sifuentes
case.
mr.
ballard
bennett
your
honor
not
in
my
case
it
does.
now,
the
same
committee
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
--
is
operated
in
somewhat
different
fashion
some
time.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
the
facts
in
my
case
were
that
the
defendant
came
up
to
this
checkpoint
at
the
early
morning
hours.
they
stopped
him
on
a
routine
basis.
mr.
ballard
bennett
two,
three,
or
four
in
the
morning.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir,
it
does
unless
they
have
to
close
it
down
for
fall
or
some
reason,
but
it
tries
to
operate
24
hours
a
day.
and,
the
officer
walked
out
and
walked
up
to
the
car
and
started
talking
with
the
driver.
as
he
got
close
to
the
car
he
looked
down
and
in
the
--
lying
down
on
the
front
seat
was
one
man
and
on
the
back
seat
lying
down
were
three
men.
he
could
not
see
these
men
at
all
until
he
got
ride
on
it,
but
he
had
an
understanding
off
to
decide
observing
the
traffic
passing
by.
he
would
not
have
seen
the
three
men
lying
down
on
the
seat.
mr.
ballard
bennett
right,
yes
sir.
so
he
asked
him
--
first
of
all
he
determined
that
the
driver
was
an
american
citizen
which
he
was.
the
driver
was
may
(inaudible)
in
town
i
believe,
he
has
lived
there
all
his
life.
and
next,
he
asked
these
aliens
and
he
did
not
get
satisfactory
response
from
them.
so
he
took
the
driver
and
the
aliens
to
what
they
call
secondary.
the
aliens
were
taken
into
van
which
i
believe
is
shown
in
the
photograph
that
the
government
has
attached
into
their
brief
and
the
driver
was
separated
and
taken
off
and
interrogated
at
another
place
separate
from
the
aliens.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well
sir,
that
is
--
when
you
say
probably
just
been
you
mean
he
just
come
to
record
on
the
border
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
any
sticker
or
anything
like
that
could
not
be
observed
your
honor
until
after
the
stop
has
been
made.
if
there
was
some
indication
and
then
they
just
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
i
could
answer
in
this
way
but
i
think
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
stop
people
if
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
may
have
been
committing
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir.
i
do
not
know,
they
were
just
coming
from
mexico
is
very
sufficient
to--
mr.
ballard
bennett
no
sir,
i
do
not
see
anything
unconstitutional
in
and
off
hand.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
yes
certainly
i
think
they
could
put,
they
--
the
theory
that
you
might
be
going
on
is
that
there
is
a
continuation
of
a
border
search.
now,
of
course,
they
have
border
searchers
up
in
saint
louis
because
that
is
better
than
having
to
stop
and
go
through
every
thing,
and
what
is
the
device
of
this
checkpoint
is
and
what
we
are
complaining
of
is
that
they
are
stopping
all
of
these
people
who
do
not
have
any
relation
to
the
problem
that
they
are
searching.
they
are
the
ones
that
get
the
stack.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well
now,
you
should
for
a
period
of
time
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
how
would
you
--
would
they
stop
and
look
on
the
date
of
the
sticker
and
put
the
time
and
they
stop
and
look
at
that?
mr.
ballard
bennett
i
would
say
that
that
--
i
really
often
do
not
have
seen
any
strong
objection
on
constitutional
ground.
it
would
be
infinitely
preferable
to
stopping
everybody
that
happens
to
come
by
with
this
point
and
on
the
chance
that
they
might
have
come
from
the
border,
which
one
of
their
indication
that
the,
chances
are
that
they
probably
did
not
come
from
the
border,
and
i
think
that
reasoning
it
on
a
consent
basis
if
you
want
to
cross
the
boarder
you
have
to
consent
to
this
reasonable
regulation.
i
feel
that
a
constitutional
justification
might
be
made
in
that
common
tips.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir
it
does.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
ballard
bennett
i
do
not
necessarily
think
that
it
does,
i
have
been
through
three
of
those
in
the
last
few
years.
one
of
them
was
obviously
reported
to
be
a
driver’s
license
check,
they
had
state
what
you
called
state
troopers,
a
department
of
public
safety
men
standing
on
each
side
and
they
had
apparently
a
checklist
and
they
look
and
they
ask
you
for
your
driver
license.
they
want
to
see
your
windshield
work,
they
watch
your
lights.
the
two
others
were
obviously
subdiffuses
that
they
were
using
just
to
stop
you,
so
they
could
look
at
you
for
some
reason.
in
fact
in
one
of
them
i
was
fumbling
around
in
my
pocket
book
trying
to
find
my
driver’s
license
which
i
could
never
find
when
i
need
it,
and
the
men
said
oh,
well
forget
it
and
turned
around
and
walked
off
and
went
back
to
the
next
car.
now,
i
would
say
that
is
obviously
unconstitutional
but
there
is
one
big
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
to
stop
you
as
a
sugdiffused
like
i
do
not
see
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes,
i
think
that
a
fairly
legitimately
checking
your
driver’s
license
and
making
an
administrative
check
of
your
car,
i
see
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
no
but
it
is
--
the
idea
is
to
see
if
people
have
committed
crimes
and
here
is
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
sir,
it
is
and
they
will
give
you
a
ticket
presumably
if
you
do
not
have
it
and
sometimes
you
will
have
it
and
do
not
have
it
on
you
and
they
will
give
you
a
ticket
then
you
have
to
go
show
up
and
they
will
dismiss
the
charge.
mr.
ballard
bennett
the
constitutional
distinction
as
i
say
it
your
honor
is
these
checkpoints
have
been
here
for
now
on
a
20
or
30
years.
the
people
who
lived
down
in
the
valley
have
been
going
thorough
there
every
time
that
they
want
to
leave
this
country.
and
these
drivers’
license
things
are
done
on
a
routine
basis
and
they
are
not
near
as
likely
to
be
oppressive.
these
checkpoints,
as
i
said
in
a
brief,
they
are
(inaudible)
devices.
you
are
down
there
and
you
have
got
to
go
through
down
and
let
them
look
at
you.
mr.
ballard
bennett
yes
surely,
i
think
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief
i
think
you
can
put
up
roadblocks
in
the
case
of
an
emergency,
in
an
exigent
situation.
i
think
society
has
that
power
to
protect
itself
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
ballard
bennett
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
ballard
bennett
i
would
say
that
they
could
not
put
up
roadblocks
just
on
a
belief
that
they
might
save
up
some
person
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
they
can
check
in
the
driver’s
license
situation
the
only
way
they
have
of
saying
if
you
are
driving
without
a
driver’s
license
is
to
ask
when
you
are
driving
if
you
have
got
a
driver’s
license,
but
that
is
not
the
only
way
they
can
act
with
the
smugglers
or
the
illegal
agents
your
honor.
mr.

bennett
no
sir,
it
surely
not
part
of
my
case
because
my
man
had
aliens
that
were
prosecuted
and
sentenced.
mr.
ballard
bennett
one
of
my
points
is
that
they
could
be
used
for
other
purposes.
mr.
ballard
bennett
in
this
instance,
no
sir.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well,
that
gets
into
a
gray
area,
i
would
say,
i
do
not
think
stopping
a
man
and
taking
him
to
custody
is
a
gray
area
but
i
feel
that
he
is
and
there
again
it
is
just
what
the
court
wants
to
let
the
federal
officials
how
far
they
want
to
let
them
intrude
and
internalize.
mr.
ballard
bennett
i
think
you
might
your
honor
but
--
mr.
ballard
bennett
that
is
right.
mr.
ballard
bennett
well
why
not
put
them
in
places
where
they
are
going
to
slow
down
anyway.
i
have
run
across,
i
believe,
cases
where
they
were
dealing
in
oklahoma
where
they
have
an
expressway
that
they
have
to
stop
and
pay
a
toll
on
and
they
have
a
border
patrol
agent
sitting
there,
watching
them
as
they
go
through.
i
do
not
think
that
is
unconstitutional.
i
have
gone
over
my
time
and.
thank
you
court.
