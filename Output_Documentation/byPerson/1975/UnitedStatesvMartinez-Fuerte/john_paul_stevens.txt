mr.
bennett
if
in
your
case
where
you
rummaged
for
your
driver’s
license
and
they
were
not
really
looking
for
driver’s
licenses.
you
said
it
is
obviously
unconstitutional,
suppose
that
they
had
been
inform
that
a
bank
robber
was
to
be
found
in
that
area
and
they
are
just
checking
cars
for
the
suspect,
would
that
make
it
--
would
that
be
permissible
or
impermissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
it
be
an
emergency
if
the
crime
had
been
committed
months
before
but
they
just
had
reason
to
believe
that
perhaps
the
suspect
was
in
the
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
cannot
do
it
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
on
the
belief
they
might
find
people
without
driver’s
licenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
two
questions
if
i
may
very
briefly.
as
first,
as
i
understand
your
theory
it
applies
to
just
the
slow
down
when
we
talked
about
a
stop
that
even
they
just
slow
them
down
at
10
miles
an
hour
to
look
in
the
car
without
any
reasons
for
separating
the
out
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
it
lesser,
they
look
in
the
windows
both
times
whether
they
stop
or
not,
i
mean
you
do
not
rely
on
the
conversation
aspect
of
the
stop
it
is
just
believe
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
they
are
slowing
down
slow
enough
to
look
in
as
the
same
as
a
stop
to
look
at?
under
your
theory
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
under
in
your
theory
do
i
correctly
conclude
that
the
random
stop
that
mr.
bennett
discussed
to
ask
if
there
were
a
driver’s
license
in
the
operator’s
possession
to
be
equally
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
your
statement
just
now
as
once
they
have
intruded,
so
you
want
to
give
them
the
first
bait.
are
there
alternatives
to
keep
the
mouth
in
the
first
place?
