how
large
is
brownville
itself?
unknown

and
that
is
south
of
the
checkpoint
here
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
part
of
your
case
here
mr.
bennett,
is
it,
that
these
stops
were
pretextual,
similar
to
your
experiences
as
second
time
you
--
unknown
speaker
well,
in
your
case
in
any
event
they
always
find
that
was
what
they
were
probably
looking
for?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
your
point
that
they
are
now
being
used
for
other
purposes.
unknown
speaker

there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion.
unknown
speaker
but
including
of
other
things,
the
complexion
i
suppose
of
the
driver.
unknown
speaker
i
think
just
to
think
that
no
lawyer
in
the
world
who
would
take
a
case
like
that
is
something
broad.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
client
wanted
you
to
bring
1983
damage
against
the
officer
for
delaying
him
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
