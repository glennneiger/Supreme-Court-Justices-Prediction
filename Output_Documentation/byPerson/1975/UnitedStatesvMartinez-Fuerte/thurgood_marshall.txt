a
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
were
talking
about
just
being
rolled
on
the
side
but
once
he
does
stop
them,
i
mean
once
he
sees
illegal
aliens
or
what
appeared
to
be
illegal
aliens
or
for
some
reason
by
lying
down
on
the
floor
and
send
them
on
secondary,
the
only
complaint
there
is
the
stop.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
stop
him
for
a
red
light.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
police
officer
could
stand
at
the
stop
sign
and
look
in
to
your
car
and
it
will
be
nothing
real
wrong
with
it.
justice

all
contraband
he
could
operate
accordingly,
could
not
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
is
to
lock
you
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
point
is
the
stop
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
you
are
objecting
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
object
to
the
guard
looking
in
the
car,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
see
somebody
laying
down
in
the
back
of
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
that
is
what
he
did
see,
did
not
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
texas
case
he
saw
three
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
had
to
do
something
