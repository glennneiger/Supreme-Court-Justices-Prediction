mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
i
first
say
that
we
here
on
direct
appeal
--
we
were
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
direct
appeal.
notice
of
appeal
was
timely
filed
and
the
last
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
constitutes
a
grant
of
a
new
trial,
rendering
unnecessary
any
consideration
of
the
motions
concerning
the
trial
court’s
arguments,
concerning
the
trial
court's
denial
of
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
the
alleged
ineffectiveness
of
her
trial
counsel,
so
we
were
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
may
it
please
the
court,
perhaps
at
the
outset
because
there
seems
to
be
such
a
striking
difference,
i
think
it
will
emerge
that
there
is
such
as
striking
difference
between
the
perceptions
of
this
case
that
i
have
and
that
my
brother
has,
but
i
should
state
our
general
view
of
the
case
and
the
general
principles
and
propositions
that
we
urge
upon
the
court,
but
i
will
fully
intent
to
very
particularly
get
into
the
record.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
as
i
understand
it,
counsel
at
that
time
had
saved
the
appeal
of
rights
and
when
substitute
counsel
did
take
over
the
appeal
and
made
the
brady
point
a
subject
of
the
appeal,
by
that
time,
there
was
the
delay
--
the
time
begin
the
run
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
that
that
was
sometime
after
the
trial
and
by
that
time
i
am
frankly,
i
am
surprised
that
there
is
a
question
about
this
because
i
simply
assumed
that
we
are
all
agreed
that
we
are
on
the
court
of
appeals
on
direct
appeal
on
the
brady
point
and
on
the
in
effectiveness
point
with
regard
to
the
motion
after
trial
than
based
on
in
effectiveness
of
counsel,
but
the
brady
point
as
i
understand
it
was
definitely
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
no,
we
were
not
trial
counsel.
now,
generally
speaking
then,
respondent’s
submission
to
the
court
today
is
that
the
knowing
possession,
the
conscious
possession
of
evidence
which
on
the
basis
of
perfectly
clear
precedent
was
admissible
at
that
trial
on
the
basis
of
the
knowing
possession
of
clearly
admissible
evidence,
readily
recognizable
as
important
to
the
issues
as
relevant
to
the
issues,
readily
recognizable
as
having
significant
prohibitive
value
and
as
destructive
to
the
prosecutor’s
case,
prohibitive
value
for
the
defense.
that
in
such
a
case,
the
defendant
is
presumptively
entitled
to
that
evidence,
and
that
any
nondisclosure
of
that
evidence
in
the
case
of
knowing
possession
as
i
say,
i
think
the
record
will
bear
out
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
and
then
i
will
proceed
--
yes?
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
and
i
will
then
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
i
am
sorry?
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes
there
--
the
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
it
(voice
overlap)
kept
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
in
this
way.
the
defendant
never
--
the
defendant
through
counsel
never
asked
the
prosecutor
specifically
for
this
evidence,
but
the
prosecutor
was
aware
of
the
fact,
through
pre-trial
investigation,
was
aware
of
the
fact
and
had
conscious
possession
of
this
evidence,
made
the
deliberate
choice,
knowing
of
its
relevance,
knowing
of
the
high
degree
of
prohibitive
value,
made
the
deliberate
choice
to
withhold
it.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
i
do
not
know
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
the
prosecutor
did
not
prevent,
but
the
prosecutor
withheld
and
that
the
withholding
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
no.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
found
in
the
prosecutor’s
file,
by
looking
in
that
file
himself
some
four
months
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
no
or
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
indicate
that
this
prosecutor
behaving
the
way
he
had
with
respect
to
this
evidence
would
have
disclosed
it.
i
see
nothing
in
this
record
to
justify,
conceding
to
this
prosecutor
the
sufficient
degree
of
good
faith,
that
he
would
have
disclosed
this.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
i
do
not
believe
i
said
that
the
prosecutor
concealed.
the
prosecutor,
if
it
pleases
your
honor,
did
not
disclose
this
evidence
to
the
defense.
he
made
the
conscious,
deliberate
choice
not
to
disclose
this
evidence
which,
again,
i
submit
the
record
will
show
and
the
nature
of
the
case
will
show
he
had
to
recognize
was
palpably
relevant,
would
have
been
very
helpful
to
the
defense
and
was
hurtful
to
his
case.
now,
the
question
really
becomes
whether
the
government
in
possession
of
exculpatory
evidence
should
be
excused
because
it
is
otherwise
available
or
because
there
no
request.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
if
it
were
highly
material,
in
any
event
it
is
not
this
case,
but
if
it
were
highly
material,
it
would
provide
the
defense
with
a
lead
to
probative
evidence,
then
yes
i
think
the
government
then
is
in
possession
of
exculpatory
material
and
would
be
obliged
to
disclose
it.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
i
do
not
know
how
far
your
honors,
question
would
take
this.
i
think
in
this
case
we
have;
what
in
fact
we
have
and
what
the
court,
i
am
asking
court
to
rule
on
is
something
physical
in
the
file
of
the
prosecutor.
that
he
was
consciously
possessed
of
and
the
court
needs
only
to
speak
to
the
specific
point.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
your
honor
and
my
question
would
be
why
not?
what
is
the
burden
on
the
government?
how
is
the
government
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
well,
our
submission
is
that
the
government
is
knowingly
possessed
of
material
which
is
helpful
to
the
defense,
there
is
an
obligation
to
disclose
that
information.
this
is
not
in
adversarial
point
at
this
stage
of
the
government
through
its
investigation.
if
the
government
through
its
preparation
for
trial
comes
across
something
helpful
to
the
defense,
there
is
nothing
to
justify
it.
it
does
not
hurt
the
government,
it
is
administratively
simple.
there
is
nothing
to
justify
the
government
withholding
that
from
the
citizen.
the
citizen
is
not
an
enemy.
the
citizen
is
not
an
adversary
with
respect
to
the
investigation
of
that
crime.
there
maybe
problems
with
disclosing
material
adverse,
that
is
the
governments’
case
against
the
defendant
which
we
deal
with
in
a
separate
system
of
rules,
but
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
this
case,
your
honor,
in
this
situation,
there
was
extent
a
decision
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
flatly
held
at
this
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
before
you
know
it,
a
decision,
the
government
mentioned
the
later
case,
but
the
earlier
case
--
the
earlier
case
is
evans,
the
later
case
burks.
burks
simply
applies
the
1960
case
which
states
flatly,
any
evidence
tending
to
show
the
kind
of
person
decedent
might
have
been
is
admissible.
all
the
arguments
made
against
admissibility,
i
am
sure,
were
made
to
the
court
in
that
case.
the
court
flatly
rejected
the
position
that
either
evidence
of
specific
acts
of
violence
or
reputation,
opinion
evidence
was
admissible
unless
the
defendant
knew
about
it.
it
expressly
rejected
that
position.
it
is
a
square
holding.
it
could
not
be
plainer.
it
rehearses
all
of
the
arguments.
the
objective
occurrence
in
issue
and
not
the
subjective
belief
is
the
important
thing.
yes?
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
i
do
not
really
know
because
they
have
not
had
presented
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
but
not
after
having
had
the
benefit
of
argument
by
both
sides
and
gaining
a
full
appreciation
for
the
problem.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
if
they
have
the
case
argued
and
it
was
not
argued
too,
but
in
any
case,
in
any
event
your
honor,
even
if
they
are
now
believe
that,
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
this
evidence
was
admissible
and
if
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
well,
of
course
our
submission
is
as
i
have
said
that
the
negligence
of
the
defense
does
not
excuse
the
failure
of
the
government
to
disclose.
the
prosecutor
and
the
government
should
be
charged
with
knowing.
we
admit
that
this
evidence
was
admissible
because
there
was
a
case
on
the
books
which
quoted
from
an
earlier
case,
the
griffin
case,
which
as
i
have
said,
if
they
are
read,
they
are
flat
holdings
that
this
evidence
is
admissible.
that
these
cases
touch
upon
this
very
nerve
center,
this
question
of
whether
or
not
a
defendant
must
know
about
this
evidence.
it
is
a
flat
holding
that
specific
acts
of
violence
are
admissible,
irrespective
of
the
knowledge
of
the
defendant
and
at
that
time
this
evidence
was
clearly
admissible
and
the
later
case
which
the
government
mentioned
solved
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
your
honor
there
was
a
conviction
for
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
and
the
1971
conviction
as
the
court’s
file
in
this
case
will
show
was
for
assault.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
so
our
position
would
be
then
that
if
we
go
to
the
record
of
this
case,
the
record
will
demonstrate
the
prosecutor
was
knowingly
possessed
of
evidence
that
as
an
experienced
prosecutor,
he
must
have
realized
and
i
think
the
court
will
conclude,
he
knew
full
well
was
prohibitive
for
the
defense
and
hurtful
of
his
case.
at
the
very
beginning,
now
the
government
suggests
that
maybe
the
prosecutor
does
not
know
a
thing
about
the
crux
of
the
defense
or
the
theory
of
the
defense,
six
months
before
the
trial
at
a
bail
hearing,
the
defense
attorney
stood
before
the
judge
and
said
we
have
a
very
real
issue
here
of
self
defense.
there
were
screams,
when
these
people
were
found,
he
was
trying
to
kill
her.
the
government
responded
to
that.
the
government
knew
six
months
before
the
trial
that
it
was
facing
a
fight
on
a
question
of
self
defense.
the
government
tells
us
or
the
prosecutors
tells
us
that
there
were
several
conferences,
both
before
and
after
the
bail
hearing
with
--
between
prosecutor
and
defense
attorney
where
they
discussed
the
issues
in
the
case
and
very
specifically,
they
discussed
the
character
of
sewell.
the
prosecutor
offered
the
characterization
he
was
not
a
pillar
of
the
community.
now,
i
think
that
very
clearly
shows
again
that
he
knew
he
was
in
a
fight
on
a
question
of
the
character
of
the
victim
in
this
death
case.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
he
could
have.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
no,
he
did
not.
but,
the
prosecutor
knew
he
had
rep
cheat
and
nor
he
did
not
tender
it
to
the
defense
counsel
and
it
was
a
perfectly
simple
thing
to
do
and
if
he
was
not
simply
stone
walling,
if
he
was
not
simply
saying
i
will
wait
this
out,
hope
he
does
not
ask
for
it,
i
hope
he
never
finds
it,
it
may
never
be
discovered
in
my
file.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
because
the
question
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
i
am
sorry.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
because
the
question
here
is
the
fairness
of
the
trial
and
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
rights
of
this
defendant
are
protected
and
if
it
turns
out
that
she
has
been
whipsawed
by
suppression
by
the
government
and
negligence
by
the
defense,
the
result
should
not
be
if
they
cancel
out.
this
is
not
a
matter
last
clear
chance.
i
reject
the
notion
that
this
is
something
like
a
negligence
case.
this
is
a
question
of
the
constitutional
duty
of
the
government
to
tender
exculpatory
material
and
i
simply
fail
to
see
any
good
reason
why
it
should
not
tender
that
favorable
material.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
your
honor,
if
the
government
through
its
resources
has
developed
this
evidence,
it
turns
out
that
some
of
it
is
favorable
to
the
accused
in
the
case,
what
is
it
about
that
situation?
i
fail
to
see
what
is
there
about
that
situation
that
would
require
the
government
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
i
agree
with
that
completely.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
not
in
the
sense
that
he
felt
that
he
did
not
want
that
evidence
nor
in
the
sense
that
he
was
sand
bagging
as
the
government
suggested
that
he
will
wait
until
after
the
trial
to
raise
it.
he
did
it
because
he
made
a
very
serious
error
of
judgment
which
constitutes
in
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel.
he
made
the
decision
because
he
was
told
something
that
he
believed
to
be
true
with
respect
to
its
admissibility.
but
he
did
not
decide
that
he
did
not
want
that.
now,
had
he
had
a
quickly
investigate
it
earlier
and
he
had
perhaps
mentioned
something
to
the
government,
that
might
have
produced
--
might
have
provoked
this
prosecutor
to
disclose
it,
but
the
record
does
not
even
established
that.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
and
discovered
the
same
evidence
under
the
same
circumstances,
a
prosecutor
knowing
that
he
had
it.
yes,
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
the
--
may
i
speak
first
whether
or
not
that
is
correct?
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
the
government
has
put
into
the
file
and
that
file
is
available
to
the
court,
it
is
file
in
this
case.
a
certificate
of
conviction
april,
1971,
a
guilty
plead
to
assault.
now,
there
was
a
charge,
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
assault
with
the
brick,
carrying
a
prohibited
weapon
knife
and
a
uniform
narcotics
act
violation.
now,
our
position
is
that
this
entire
record
constitutes
on
the
one
hand
actual
evidence
itself,
admissible
evidence
showing
specific
acts
of
violence
under
the
evans
case,
secondly,
it
provides
an
excellent
lead
to
the
defense
attorney
with
respect
to
opinion
in
reputation
evidence
and
thirdly,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
admissible
as
the
burks
case
shows.
the
burks
case,
let
me
just
quickly
say,
involved
the
conviction
for
cruelty
to
a
child,
that
was
the
only
conviction
and
the
court
ruled
that
the
defense
could
show
that
the
victim
caused
the
death
of
the
child.
so
here,
the
defendant
could
show
not
merely
the
convictions,
but
also
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
this
bargained
plea
--
it
would
be
open
to
the
defense
to
show
the
actual
circumstances
of
the
assault
with
the
brick,
of
the
assault
with
razor,
carrying,
well
there
was
a
conviction
for
assault
with
the
razor,
but
the
carrying
of
the
brick
and
the
prohibited
weapon
knife
presumably
the
same
bowie
knife.
now,
the
record
further
more
as
i
have
said
this
prosecutor
knew
then
he
was
in
a
fight,
he
knew
that
he
had
a
knife
issue,
he
knew
that
he
had
a
character
issue,
he
came
to
possess
a
record
with
this
rich
promise
for
the
defendant
as
far
exculpatory
evidence
was
concerned,
and
he
had
to
then
decide
whether
or
not
under
the
brady
rule,
he
had
to
disclose
that.
he
made
the
conscious
decision,
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
it
was
one
of
callous
indifference,
he
made
the
conscious
decision
not
to
disclose
that
evidence.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
well,
we
do
know
that
he
has
admitted
to
having
heard
this
fact
--
the
defense
in
the
case,
the
whole
crux
of
the
defense
was
to
be
the
self
defense.
we
know
that
he
was
thinking
of
a
tough
fight
in
a
murder
case
and
we
know
then
that
he
must
have
deliberately
sought
and
obtained
this
criminal
record.
now,
was
he
simply
somehow
errorly
innocent
about
whether
or
not
that
might
hurt
his
case,
if
it
came
before
a
jury?
did
he
not
have
conscious
thought
to
whether
or
not
this
was
admissible
in
evidence
and
if
he
did,
did
he
do
any
research
and
should
not
the
government
be
charged
with
knowing
that
this
case
held
this
is
was
flatly
admissible.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
very
definitely
he
is
and
having
failed
to
do
within
this
case,
there
is
an
affect
of
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
well,
that
of
course
would
destroy
the
old
notion
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
well,
i
do
not
--
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
my
view
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
it
is
the
view
of
the
american
bar
association
in
its
promulgated
standards
and
it
is
the
view
of
the
now
leading
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
says
prompt
investigation
of
factual
material
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
your
honor
and
magnan
as
i
understand
it
invited
the
various
localities
and
jurisdictions
to
begin
formulating
specific
principles
which
is
what
has
happened
in
the
caster.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
well,
the
record
of
the
case,
the
transcript
of
the
case
and
all
of
the
references
--
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
no,
your
honor.
i
must
disagree
with
that.
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
prosecutor
thought
this
evidence
was
inadmissible.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
at
this
time
under
the
evans
case
and
the
griffin
case
was
that
this
evidence
was
admissible
and
that
was
immediately
available
to
the
prosecutor
and
i
simply
cannot
believe
that
a
prosecutor
trying
a
murder
case
was
unaware
of
those
cases.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
and
i
think
the
record
there
is
that
out.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
and
furthermore,
you
see
what
has
happened
in
this
case,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
there
was
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
well
we
all
know
that
it
was
sewell’s
knife.
the
jury
knew
nothing
of
the
sort.
now,
as
i
have
said,
he
knew,
we
had
the
prosecutor
who
knew
we
had
a
knife
issue
and
in
the
pre-trial,
he
conceded
to
the
defense
attorney,
well,
it
looks
like
you
are
right,
it
is
sewell’s
knife
you
will
see
that
on
page
848
of
the
appendix.
the
first
witness
that
he
called
in
the
case
was
sewell’s
wife,
the
victim.
he
asked
her
did
your
husband
carry
a
bowie?
“no
never!”
and
he
took
pains
to
have
it
demonstrate
to
the
jury
the
length
of
the
knife
that
he
did
carry,
indicating
that
it
was
merely
a
penknife
and
it
was
a
penknife
that
was
found
in
his
pocket.
this
prosecutor
having
conceded
prior
to
trial,
not
only
they
had
a
knife
issue,
but
apparently
he
was
going
the
other
way,
then
went
into
the
trial,
having
concealed
some
very
eloquent
evidence
as
to
knife
carrying
from
the
defense,
went
to
the
trial
and
then
developed
for
the
jury
evidence
from
which
they
certainly
must
have
concluded,
taking
the
invitation
of
the
prosecutor
that
this
knife
was
not
taken
into
that
room
by
sewell.
he
then
asked
the
desk
clerk,
“did
observe
any
weapon?”
and
that
the
desk
clerk
said
“no”.
now,
these
were
the
first
two
witnesses.
then
later
in
the
trial,
he
brings
in
another
person
who
was
in
the
motel,
griffin,
brings
him
from
the
lock
up,
asks
him
some
very
brief
questions,
one
of
which
was
whether
or
not
you
observed
the
weapon
and
he
said
“yes
he
had.”
and,
then
he
also
asked
him
another
question
with
respect
to
the
position
on
the
knife
and
proceeded
to
discredit
his
testimony
on
that.
the
only
evidence
before
the
jury
in
other
words
that
sewell
the
victim
carried
a
knife
was
from
a
witness
discredited
by
the
prosecutor.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
so
this
was
a
prosecutor
who
over
played
his
adversarial
role.
he
knew
he
had
evidence
as
i
have
said
an
excellent
characterization
was
that
he
simply
stone
walled.
now,
that
is
what
is
the
result
is
going
to
be
if
you
follow
the
suggestion
of
the
government
here
today.
if
this
court
does
not
take
the
opportunity
to
announce
a
rule,
as
a
matter
of
firm
policy
that
anything
consciously
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecution
which
is
readily
recognizable
as
relevant
to
the
defense
and
hurtful
to
the
prosecution
that
that
must
be
turned
over
to
the
defense.
what
you
are
going
to
get
is
a
prosecution
and
doing
precisely
what
the
united
states
attorney
did,
waving
and
hoping
that
the
defense
will
miss
the
boat
and
then
arguing
contributory
negligence
or
arguing
should
the
defense
have
to
help
itself,
and
i
submit
that
that
is
an
excess
of
any
adversary
concept.
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
rule
or
would
submit
to
you
that
the
rule
that
we
ask
you
to
follow
today
is
as
i
have
said
administratively
feasible.
there
is
no
hurt
to
the
government
in
having
to
comply
with
this
rule.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
your
honor,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
with
difference,
an
invalid
behavioral
assumption.
i
think
prosecutors
and
defense
attorneys
will
both
try
to
win
cases.
i
think
that
defense
attorney
with
the
limitation
of
resources
and
time
and
astuteness
will
do
its
best
to
uncover
evidence.
and
i
think
you
can
--
i
think
we
count
on
that.
in
any
event
if
you
suspect
that
the
defense
attorney
will
seat
back,
waiting
then
until
after
trial
to
raise
the
brady
point,
the
answer
is
very
simple.
had
the
prosecutor
combed
his
file
before
trial
and
if
there
is
anything
remotely
helpful,
disclose
it.
it
sounds
the
problem
perfectly
for
the
government,
and
there
is
no
way
it
seems
to
me
that
will
impose
if
we
require
that
impose
any
undue
burden
on
the
government.
and
in
fairness,
it
should
be
required.
why
again
should
the
government
be
allowed
do
withhold
the
exculpatory
material?
so
this
was
i
think
is
clear
from
the
case
law
admissible.
i
think
when
you
fully
consider
the
issues
in
the
case
and
what
was
going
through,
it
had
to
be
going
through
the
mind
of
this
prosecutor,
he
was
talking
about
this
issues
with
the
defense
that
he
knowingly
withheld
admissible,
helpful
evidence
that
he
was
callously
indifferent
and
that
if
the
defense
had
had
this
issue
or
had
had
this
evidence,
it
would
have
change
fundamentally
the
whole
character
of
this
trial.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
five
to
20
years,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
and
at
this
point
the
defendant
has
served,
has
credit
for
three
years.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
he
was
an
appointed
counsel,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes.
mr.
edwin
j.
bradley
yes,
--
no
a
private
practitioner.
