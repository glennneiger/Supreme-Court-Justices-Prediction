justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
was
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
direct
appeal
from
the
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
nothing
turns
on
the
nature
of
the
newly
discovered
evidence
for
purposes
of
amending
or
denying
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
or
for
a
new
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
is
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
posture
of
an
attack
on
the
judgment
of
conviction
or
a
claim
that
the
trial
judge
erred
in
denying
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
a
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
--
forget
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
can
defense
counsel
simply
obtain
by
discovery
of
the
wrap
sheet
on
the
decedent
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
are
saying
in
effect,
he
could
have
gotten
it
by
means
other
than
going
to
the
prosecutor
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
it
was
not
in
the
exclusive
province
of
the
prosecutor
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
it
is
different
than
saying,
he
could
have
gone
to
the
prosecutor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
focused
defense
request,
you
mean
something
more
than
than
just
a
request
for
“brady
material?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
defendant
probably
does
not
know
any
more
or
probably
knows
less
about
what
is
in
prosecutor’s
file
and
the
prosecutor
does
and
they
both
know
what
kinds
of
evidence
would
be
relevant,
do
not
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
grant
of
new
trial
you
should
get
after
judgment
of
conviction
is
reversed,
is
it
not?
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
direct
appeal,
this
case
is
where
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
sent
back
for
another
ground?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bradley?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
use
a
couple
unto
your
expression
conscious
possession
which
suggests
almost
the
presence
of
a
physical
document
in
the
file.
is
your
view
of
the
law
that
that
confine?
i
mean,
what
if
the
prosecutor
may
have
heard
from
a
witness
something
that
is
favorable
to
the
defendant.
he
never
made
any
notes
of
it,
it
is
not
in
his
file.
does
he
consciously
possess
in
your
use
of
that
word
that
bit
of
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
not
just
open
files,
but
it
is
full
divulgence
of
all
conversations
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
may
have
had
with
witnesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
know
about
the
man
state
of
mind?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
not
the
defense
counsel
be
charged
with
precisely
the
same
thing,
he
is
the
member
of
the
bar?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
so
mr.
bradley?
in
all
walks
of
life,
except
apparently
in
your
view
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
principals
are
charged
with
the
acts
of
their
agents?
now,
why
should
the
defendant
here
be
charged
with
the
action
of
her
agent
who
is
her
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
certainly
water
it
down
some
from
your
rather
wide
ranging
views?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
court
has
spoken
on
the
subject
and
defined
it
has
it
not
in
magnan
and
terlep?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
recall
magnan
saying
anything
about
that
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
