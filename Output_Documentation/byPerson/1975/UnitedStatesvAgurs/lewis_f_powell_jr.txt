justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
not
true
that
four
judges
of
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
disagree
with
what
you
just
said
about
the
law
in
that
second?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
opinion
by
the
four
judges
who
would
have
granted
en
banc
consideration
of
the
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
saying
they
may
have
had
different
view
as
they
had
the
case
argued?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
can
you
say
in
light
of
the
doubt
that
certainly
exists
as
evidenced
by
the
opinion
of
four
of
the
judges
that
the
prosecutor
deliberately
withheld
information
which
he
and
counsel
for
the
defendant
both
thought
as
the
four
judges
did
that
the
evidence
was
inadmissible?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bradley?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
place
such
emphasis
on
what
you
characterize
as
a
callous
and
deliberate
withholding
this
information.
you
are
aware
i
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
judgment
you
are
sustaining
here
today,
expressly
said
after
commenting
on
what
the
prosecutor
did,
that
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
prosecution
engaged
in
deliberate
suppression.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
note
nine,
so
you
--
what
you
are
really
doing
is
making
an
argumentation
based
on
semis.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
puts
it
beyond
your
argument,
is
not
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
rule
certainly
was
not
settled
across
the
country
as
it
(voice
overlap)
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
are
charging
with
callous
and
deliberate
withholding
of
evidence
relevant
to
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand.
