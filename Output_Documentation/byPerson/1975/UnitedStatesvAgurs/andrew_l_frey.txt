mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
to
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
had
ordered
a
new
trial.
on
the
afternoon
of
september
of
24,
1971,
respondent
and
the
decedent
james
sewell
checked
into
a
northwest
washington
tourist
home,
registering
as
man
and
wife.
about
15
minutes
later,
three
employees
of
the
tourist
home
heard
screams
emanating
from
the
room
occupied
by
sewell
and
respondent.
upon
forcing
open
the
door
of
the
room,
they
discovered
its
two
occupants
on
the
bed,
sewell
lying
on
top
of
respondent
and
both
holding
onto
a
knife.
there
was
testimony
showing
that
respondent’s
hand
was
on
the
handle
of
the
knife
and
sewell’s
on
the
blade.
after
two
were
separated,
police
and
an
ambulance
were
called.
sewell
was
taken
to
a
nearby
hospital
where
he
died.
respondent
in
the
meanwhile
had
slipped
out
of
the
tourist
home
in
the
confusion
and
disappeared.
the
evidence
showed
that
sewell
had
had
some
$345.00
in
cash
on
his
purse
about
two
hours
before
the
fatal
incident,
which
money
was
not
found
on
his
person
or
in
the
room
after
the
stabbing.
an
autopsy
of
sewell
revealed
that
he
had
been
stabbed
numerous
times
in
the
chest,
abdomen
and
back
with
a
knife,
including
a
stab
wound
of
three-and-half
to
four
inches
in
depth
into
the
heart
and
another
that
entered
just
above
the
navel
and
penetrated
about
five-and-half
inches
into
the
liver.
there
were
also
cuts
on
the
palms
of
sewell’s
hands
of
a
kind,
according
to
the
medical
examiner,
that
might
be
received
one
trying
to
defend
himself
from
a
knife
attack.
respondent
turned
herself
into
the
police
the
next
day
at
which
time
a
physical
examination
of
her
disclosed
no
cuts,
wounds
or
bruises
on
her
person.
the
prosecution’s
theory
at
trial
was
that
sewell
had
gone
to
the
bathroom,
down
the
hall,
and
upon
return
to
the
room
had
found
respondent
riffling
through
his
clothing.
in
the
ensuing
dispute,
respondent
took
the
knife
and
repeatedly
stabbed
sewell
causing
his
death.
the
defense
contended
that
respondent,
who
did
not
testify
as
to
what
had
transpired,
may
have
acted
in
self
defense.
counsel
based
his
argument
to
this
effect
on
the
fact
that
it
was
respondent’s
screams
that
the
motel
employees
had
heard
and
the
fact
that
when
they
broke
into
their
room,
sewell
was
lying
on
top
of
the
respondent.
the
jury
found
respondent
guilty
of
second
degree
murder.
in
the
course
of
preparing
for
trial,
respondent’s
trial
counsel
had
interviewed
a
witness
who
advised
them
that
he
believed
that
sewell
had
been
arrested
a
number
of
times
and
possibly
convicted
for
assault
with
a
knife.
after
consulting
with
another
attorney
who
was
a
former
teacher
of
criminal
law
and
an
experienced
practitioner,
counsel
concluded
that
any
criminal
record
sewell
may
have
had
would
have
been
inadmissible
in
evidence
in
support
of
respondent’s
claim
of
self
defense
because
it
was
not
known
to
respondent.
he,
therefore,
made
no
further
effort
to
discover
or
use
information
on
this
subject.
as
some
three
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
he
so
stated
in
his
affidavit
in
this
case.
some
three
months
after
respondent
was
convicted,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
a
case
called
united
states
against
burkes
in
which
it
stated
in
dictum
that
evidence
of
prior
specific
acts
of
violence
by
a
deceased
would
be
admissible
in
a
homicide
case
to
support
a
claim
of
self
defense,
even
if
not
known
to
the
defendant.
when
counsel
learned
of
this
decision,
he
checked
the
prosecutor’s
case
file
and
found
that
it
did
contain
sewell’s
criminal
record
which
consisted
of
two
misdemeanor
convictions
in
1963;
one
for
carrying
a
knife
and
one
for
simple
assault
with
a
knife,
this
was
eight
years
before
the
homicide,
and
another
misdemeanor
conviction
in
1971
for
carrying
a
knife.
he
there
upon
brought
this
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
a
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence
which
has
led
us
here
today.
the
district
court
denied
respondent’s
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
basis
of
alleged
prosecutorial
suppression
of
the
evidence
of
sewell’s
criminal
record
and
subsequently
also
denied
a
second
motion
for
new
trial,
based
upon
the
allege
ineffectiveness
of
respondent’s
trial
counsel
in
pursuing
this
matter.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
while
it
expressly
refused
to
find
that
the
prosecutor
had
engaged
in
deliberate
suppression,
it
concluded
that
the
element
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
in
the
absence
of
a
defense
request
for
the
non-disclosed
evidence
in
this
case,
were
much
less
significant
in
assessing
a
new
trial
motion
than
the
materiality
of
the
undisclosed
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
yes
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
direct
appeal.
when
this
matter
came
out
it
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing.
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
denied.
it
was
then
--
the
trial
counsel
then
moved
to
have
himself
remove
as
counsel,
a
new
counsel
was
appointed
and
was
re-amended
i
believe
to
the
district
court
for
a
second
hearing
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
point,
but
i
believe
it
was
on
direct
appeal
rather
than
collateral
attack.
i
do
not
think
it
would
really
make
any
difference
though
to
the
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure,
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
later,
yes.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
new
trial
is
required
whenever,
irrespective
of
the
blame
worthiness
of
the
prosecutor’s
conduct,
the
undisclosed
evidence
might
have
led
the
jury
to
entertain
a
reasonable
doubt
about
a
defendant’s
guilt.
it
concluded
that
this
evidence
came
within
that
category
and
thus
a
new
trial
was
required.
in
so
ruling,
the
court
was
essentially
following
the
precedent
established
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
nearly
ten
years
earlier
in
the
decisions
in
levine
against
katzenbach
and
levine
against
clark,
from
which
the
chief
justice,
then
a
circuit
judge
vigorously
dissented.
in
the
view
of
the
majority
of
those
cases,
the
absence
of
a
defense
request
and
the
lack
of
defense
diligence
in
discovering
evidence,
subsequently
claim
to
justify
a
new
trial
are
factors
to
be
given
little
or
no
weight
in
deciding
the
new
trial
motion.
the
mere
fact
that
the
prosecutor
possessed
evidence
that
might
have
been
helpful
to
the
defense
was
alone
sufficient
to
require
a
new
trial.
the
dissent
effectively
expressed
the
contrary
view,
which
is
our
view,
that
those
factors
are
critical,
that
is
prosecutorial
breach
of
duty
and
defense
diligence
and
that
their
abandonment
is
difficult
to
justify
either
in
logic
or
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
such
a
ruling
upon
the
fabric
of
our
adversarial
system.
at
the
heart
of
this
and
like
cases
in
our
view,
there
is
the
need
to
choose
between
these
two
analytical
models,
the
one
propounded
by
chief
judge
basil
on
eleventh,
the
clear
tendency
of
which
is
to
impel
the
government
toward
an
open
files
policy
in
criminal
cases
and
the
one
upon
which
the
chief
justice’s
dissent
was
grounded,
which
seeks
to
define
a
duty
of
disclosure
within
the
context
of
the
adversarial
system.
now,
before
turning
to
further
discussion
of
these
analytical
models,
let
me
stress
the
salient
facts
of
this
case,
which
in
our
view
conclusively
demonstrate
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeal’s
decision.
first,
the
defense
knew
that
sewell
probably
had
a
criminal
record,
but
it
chose
not
to
pin
down
the
details
of
it.
this
was
not
evidence
within
the
prosecutor’s
exclusive
possession.
it
was
equally
available
to
the
defense.
they
simply
had
to
subpoena
the
police
department
to
get
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
will
if
the
court
wishes
at
the
conclusion
of
my
argument.
we
have
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
she
relies
on
it.
she
relies
on
it
in
our
replied
brief,
we
have
addressed
it.
we
think
that
it
is
a
proper
issue
before
the
court
that
it
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
and
we
urge
this
court
to
decide
it
and
we
have
discussed
why
even--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
not
decided
below.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
presented
below.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
presented,
but
it
was
not
decided.
and
the
reason
that
we
are
urging
this
court
to
decide
it
is
two-fold.
one
is
that
this
homicide
occurred
in
1971
and
this
case
has
been
going
a
very
long
time
without
resolution
and
secondly,
it
is
really
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
or
nondisclosure
and
i
think
that
the
two
issues
are
sufficiently
interrelated
that
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
consider
both
aspects
in
reaching
its
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
advised
that
certainly
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
tried,
i
mean,
there
is
a
privacy
act
in
illinios
law
and
i
do
not
know
that
it
would
apply
to
a
deceased,
but
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
and
i
believe
all
that
was
necessary
was
a
subpoena
to
the
police
department.
in
this
case,
although
it
was
necessary,
surely
it
was
a
request
to
the
prosecutors
any
information.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
making
both
points,
although
i
think
they
both
have
telling
effect
in
the
same
direction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
i
am
also
--
i
am
making,
although
i
realize
there
is
now
finding
on
this
issue,
i
am
simply
making
a
pragmatic
assessment.
i
mean,
had
they
gone
to
the
prosecutor
and
asked
this,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
it
would
not
have
been
given.
prosecutors
frequently,
voluntarily
disclose
information
that
is
requested
of
him.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
got
it
from
the
prosecutor
afterwards.
they
could
have
gotten
from
either
the
prosecutor
or
the
police
department
i
think
before
trial.
now,
the
second
point
is
that
both
the
defense
and
the
prosecution
believe
that
the
record
was
not
admissible
in
evidence.
thus,
even
if
the
prosecutor
had
disclosed
the
record
to
the
defense,
it
would
not
have
been
used
at
the
trial.
now,
thirdly,
this
view
of
inadmissibility
was
quite
reasonable
at
the
time.
it
was
only
as
the
result
of
a
dictum
in
a
case
decided
three
months
later
that
it
appeared
likely
that
such
evidence
might
have
been
held
admissible.
and
indeed
today,
i
think
six
judges
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
indicated
in
their
opinions,
on
our
petition
for
re-hearing
that
they
would
probably
view
this
evidence
as
inadmissible
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
the
local
court
has
stated
that
such
evidence
would
be
inadmissible
if
not
known
to
the
defense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
asked
them
to
and
--
i
cannot
answer.
they
were
four
votes
for
re-hearing
en
banc.
but,
we
needed
five
(inaudible)
to
secure.
now,
finally,
even
if
the
defense
had
known
of
the
evidence
and
of
its
admissibility,
there
were
good
tactical
reasons
not
to
use
it
and
these
are
addressed
in
a
last
section
of
our
brief
and
respondent
has
not
really
answered
them.
the
evidence
would
have
tended
to
show
sewell’s
familiarity
with
a
knife,
and
therefore,
enhance
the
implausibility
that
respondent
could
have
--
had
he
attacked
her
first
succeeded
in
inflicting
such
grievous
wounds
upon
him
and
escaping
totally
unscathed
herself.
now,
if
a
new
trial
is
going
to
be
required
on
the
basis
of
evidence
such
as
this,
we
think
there
is
a
very
little
left
to
any
principal
of
finality
of
judgments
in
criminal
cases.
turning
to
the
analytical
framework;
in
our
view
cases
like
this
can
and
should
be
approached
analytically
in
much
the
same
manner
as
any
motion
for
a
new
trial
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence.
the
first
ingredient
in
every
such
case
is
the
question
whether
the
evidence
is
in
fact
properly
characterized
as
newly
discovered.
it
is
uniformly
been
held
that
evidence
known
to
the
defendant
or
discoverable
in
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
cannot
supply
the
basis
for
a
new
trial.
there
is
no
reason
to
depart
from
that
simply
because
of
brady
claim
was
involved.
indeed,
it
is
highly
inappropriate
to
do
so
because
the
heart
of
the
brady
claim
relates
to
evidence
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
government.
now,
let
us
assume,
however,
that
at
the
evidence
of
sewell’s
criminal
record
can
properly
somehow
be
treated
as
newly
discovered
or
that
the
requirement
of
new
discovery
can
be
dispensed
with,
court
must
next
consider
in
any
new
trial
motion
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence,
what
the
proper
standard
is
for
assessing
the
sufficiency
of
the
particular
piece
of
evidence
to
warrant
a
new
trial.
now,
ordinarily
when
the
evidence
is
simply
uncovered
and
it
was
unknown
to
anyone
prior
to
the
trial,
the
standard
is
whether
the
evidence
would
probably
result
in
a
different
verdict
on
re-trial,
this
is
an
ancient
and
nearly
uniformly
followed
standard.
that
standard
fully
accounts
for
the
balance
that
we
have
struck
in
our
system
between
the
undeniably
important
interest
that
convictions
of
innocent
persons
not
to
be
permitted
to
stand,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
interest
in
the
finality
of
judgment
survive
that
after
fair
trials.
no
one
seriously
suggests
that
respondent
can
meet
that
standard
in
this
case.
if
she
is
to
get
a
new
trial
therefore,
it
is
not
because
of
concern
that
she
maybe
innocent,
but
because
of
other
policies.
now,
to
sharpen
the
focus,
the
question
is
what
bearing
does
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
possessed
the
particular
piece
of
evidence
in
question
here,
have
on
the
standard
to
be
applied,
in
determining
whether
the
evidence
supports
a
new
trial?
the
court
of
appeals
plainly
believed
that
that
fact
alone
sufficed
to
justify
a
new
trial
in
the
most
generous
possible
standard,
that
is
whether
the
evidence
might
have
affect
of
the
jury’s
verdict.
we
say
that
that
fact
standing
alone
has
no
effect,
that
further
questions
must
be
asked,
that
is
did
the
prosecutor’s
failure
to
disclose
constitute
a
breach
of
duty
on
his
part?
only
if
that
question
can
be
answered
affirmatively,
is
there
any
justification
to
depart
from
the
normal
standards
for
awarding
new
trials
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence,
because
only
then
can
it
be
said
that
the
trial
that
did
take
place
was
in
effect
with
unfairness
and
only
then
can
it
be
thought
that
the
award
of
a
new
trial
might
serve
a
useful
function
in
shaping
future
prosecutorial
behavior.
now,
this
analysis
that
i
am
propounding,
some
of
the
commentators
have
suggested
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
certain
language
in
this
court’s
decision
in
brady
against
maryland.
specifically
what
the
court
said
in
summarizing
its
holding
was
that
the
suppression
by
the
prosecution
of
evidence
favorable
to
an
accused
upon
request
violates
due
process,
when
the
evidence
is
materialized
to
guilt
or
punishment
and
here
are
the
important
words,
“irrespective
of
the
good
faith
or
bad
faith
of
the
prosecution.”
now,
in
levine
against
clark,
the
majority
took
the
view
that
that
language
meant
that
the
more
generous
standard
of
awarding
a
new
trial
as
not
to
turn
on
prosecutorial
misconduct,
but
simply
to
turn
on
consideration
of
whether
the
evidence
might
have
helped
the
defendant,
had
not
been
introduced
at
the
original
trial
and
we
think
that
is
incorrect.
first
of
all,
the
language
applies
only
when
there
is
a
defense
request.
the
defense
request
in
some
sense
maybe
viewed
as
taking
the
place
off
or
imposing
an
additional
duty
on
the
prosecutor,
and
therefore,
relieving
the
court
of
the
obligation
to
make
a
determination
about
his
subjective
state
of
mind.
in
any
event,
we
think
what
that
language
means
is
that
you
judge
the
prosecutor’s
conduct
not
by
having
to
find
subjective
bad
faith,
not
by
having
to
find
willful
misconduct,
but
by
looking
at
the
known
facts
and
determining
whether
objectively
viewed,
those
facts
show
a
departure
from
his
duties.
this
is
the
same
standard
that
is
used
in
conventional
negligence
law.
it
is
still
requires
that
he
had
a
duty
to
disclose.
if
he
had
no
duty
to
disclose
that
he
breached,
it
is
simply
pointless
to
award
new
trials
by
virtue
of
what
turns
out
then
to
be
a
wholly
fortuitous
fact
that
he
had
the
piece
of
paper
in
his
file
that
contained
this
evidence.
now,
if
we
agree
thus
far
that
the
prosecutor
must
have
breached
the
duty
of
disclosure,
we
next
suggest
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
meaningfully
specific
defense
request
is
a
central
importance
in
defining
the
prosecutor’s
duty
of
disclosure.
now,
let
us
be
clear
about
what
i
am
contending
here.
if
the
prosecutor
has
willfully
suppressed
evidence,
acted
with
mens
rea,
a
request
would
be
unnecessary.
moreover
as
judge
friendly
has
indicated
in
the
keogh
case
and
has
come
to
be
generally
accepted
in
the
second
circuit
and
a
number
of
other
courts,
if
the
evidences
of
such
obvious
exculpatory
value
that
it
could
not
have
escaped
the
prosecutor’s
attention
even
without
a
request,
then,
there
would
be
justification
in
those
circumstances
for
awarding
a
new
trial,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
request.
the
case
is
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
9-a
of
the
petition,
in
footnote
10,
are
such
cases.
in
the
hibler
case,
the
prosecutor
misrepresented
the
testimony
that
would
be
given
in
proposing
a
stipulation,
although
he
knew
that
the
person
would
not
testify
as
he
proposed
in
the
stipulation.
in
baldi,
the
prosecutor
failed
to
disclose
to
the
defendant
ballistics
evidence
indicating,
a
finger
print
evidence
indicating
strongly
that
the
defendant
was
not
guilty.
in
meers
against
wilkins
which
mr.
justice
marshall
wrote
when
he
was
on
the
second
circuit,
two
eye
witnesses
known
to
the
prosecution
and
not
known
to
the
defense
had
failed
to
identify
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor
had
not
disclosed
that.
in
pool,
it
was
a
rape
case
and
there
was
evidence,
medical
evidence
that
in
fact
the
complainant
had
not
had
sexual
intercourse.
now,
when
we
are
talking
about
that
kind
of
evidence,
we
do
not
doubt
that
the
prosecutor
has
a
duty
of
disclosure
to
the
defense
even
in
the
absence
of
a
request.
although,
if
the
defense
already
knew
about
the
evidence,
we
do
doubt
that
a
new
trial
would
be
required.
but
most
situations
do
not
involve
that.
as
judge
friendly
said
in
keogh,
that
is
the
rare
case
when
the
prosecutor
acts
with
that
kind
of
gross
negligence
or
callous
disregard
for
fair
play.
the
normal
case
is
a
case
like
this
in
which
the
prosecutor
who
naturally
is
an
adversary
looking
at
the
file
from
a
certain
prospective
who
is
not
familiar
--
he
does
not
know
what
the
defense
knows,
he
does
not
know
what
the
defense
is
going
to
be.
he
does
not
know
what
information
is
likely
to
be
important
to
a
defendant
and
what
information
is
likely
to
be
of
no
interest
at
all.
in
that
situation,
it
is
awfully
easy
for
him
to
make
a
mistake,
for
him
to
fail
to
appreciate
the
exculpatory
utility
of
a
piece
of
information
in
his
file,
unless
he
has
had
the
benefit
of
a
focused
defense
request
which
calls
his
attention
to
that
kind
of
information,
which
therefore
elevates
his
duty
to
examine
that
kind
of
information
with
care
to
look
at
it
from
the
prospective
of
a
defendant
and
to
see
whether
so
viewed,
he
can
perceive
its
utility
to
the
defense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
our
firm
position
on
this
is
that
a
request
for
all
brady
material,
all
exculpatory
material
is
the
equivalent
of
no
request.
all
that
does
is
--
say
the
prosecutor
please
obey
your
constitutional
or
other
obligations.
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
perform
the
function
that
a
request
is
to
perform
which
is
to
call
the
prosecutor’s
attention
to
certain
kinds
of
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
not
necessarily
true.
first
of
all,
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
knows
whether
it
is
in
the
file
or
not
is
not
relevant.
he
can
ask
for
if
it
is
not
in
the
file,
a
prosecutor
would
not
produce
it.
but
i
think
in
most
cases,
the
defendant
can
anticipate.
i
know
it
has
been
suggested
how
can
the
defendant
know
what
is
in
the
prosecution’s
file.
in
our
view,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
think
to
think
about
civil
litigation
and
think
about
a
lawyer
of
minimum
of
competence
preparing
a
series
of
written
interrogatories
for
a
witness
and
you
will
see
that
it
is
quite
easy.
i
mean
this
case
is
a
perfect
example.
if
the
defense
wanted
sewell’s
criminal
record
in
order
to
show
that
he
was
the
aggressor,
it
was
a
very
simple
thing
for
them
to
ask
for
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
it
was
--
the
trial
is
in
july,
the
burks
decision
was
in
october.
trial
counsel
read
about
the
burks
decision
in
november
of
1971
and
it
was
in
a
few
days
thereafter,
went
down
to
the
us
attorney’s
office
and
prosecutor
showed
him
the
file.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
before
the
--
about
two
or
three
months
before
the
trial.
he
looked
into
it
to
the
extent
of
determining,
i
think
probably
correctly
from
this
consultation
that
it
would
not
be
admissible.
as
it
turned
out,
this
particular
panel
had
said
on
a
direct
appeal
over
refusal
to
admit
the
evidence
might
have
reversed
the
conviction,
but
i
do
not
think
that
even
represents
majority
sentiment
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
in
any
event,
i
think
that
is
an
important
point,
not
so
much
in
this
case,
where
there
was
no
request,
but
in
terms
of
understanding
the
general
analysis
that
to
ask
defendant
simply
to
request
to
all
brady
material
is
a
formality.
i
mean,
if
that
is
all
it
amounts
to,
then
i
think
we
might
as
well
forget
about
having
a
request
for
acquiring
because
it
would
simply
be
unfair
to
those
--
it
is
inconceivable
that
there
would
be
any
reason
for
a
defendant
not
to
ask
in
that
fashion.
what
the
defendant
has
to
do
is
call
to
the
attention
of
the
prosecutor
that
he
is
interested
in
certain
kinds
of
information.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
i
think
if
you
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
clear.
the
requirement
to
turn
over
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
is
required
--
well,
the
constitutional
standard
which
this
court
has
expressed
is
in
terms
of
evidence
that
is
requested
by
the
defense
that
it
is
favorable
and
that
is
material.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
case
is
perfect
example.
he
knew
about
--
he
had
in
file
a
criminal
record
of
the
decedent
which
is
something
that
as
a
matter
of
routine
trial
preparation
he
requires
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
favorable
because
it
would
have
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
do
challenge
that
finding
in
part
three
of
our
brief.
what
we
are
not
challenging
is
that
it
was
admissible.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
right,
which
was
already
in
evidence
that
he
was
carrying
a
knife
on
the
particular
occasion,
but
let
me
point
to
another
example.
in
levine
case,
the
evidence
that
the
prosecutor
had
was
a
statement
from
a
witness
equally
available
to
the
defense
that
he
did
not
remember
something,
which
the
prosecutor
--
the
prosecutor
was
not
planning
to
use
this
witness
to
prove
the
point.
yet,
the
court
said
and
as
it
often
does
that
well
had
the
defendant
had
this
which
he
could
have
gotten
by
simply
going
and
asking
the
witness
the
same
questions,
had
the
defendant
have
this
why
he
might
have
changed
his
defense
strategy,
he
might
have
been
able
to
utilize
this
non-recollection
of
a
particular
event
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
if
there
were
brady
request
in
levine,
for
instance,
for
any
evidence
in
the
prosecution’s
position
that
a
witness
had
not
recollected
certain
transactions
and
it
is
not
as
difficult.
i
think
if
you
think
about
it
is
not
as
difficult
as
you
might
suppose
for
a
lawyer
to
come
up
with
a
focused
request.
he
knows
what
the
issues
are.
he
has
talked
to
his
client.
his
client
has
told
him
what
actually
happen,
that
is
what
his
client
knows.
often
his
client
has
considerable
involvement
in
the
events,
but
not
under
the
defense
culpable
involvement.
i
do
not
think
it
is
insurmountable.
now,
obviously
if
the
nature
of
the
information
is
such
that
the
prosecutor
can
appreciate
that
the
defense
could
not
possibly
realize
that
it
existed,
that
would
go
into
the
mix
in
determining
whether
the
prosecutor
had
comported
with
his
duties.
it
is
not
important
so
much
how
the
duties
are
defined
as
that
we
clearly
recognize
at
the
outset
the
principle
that
there
must
be
a
breach
of
duty.
however,
the
court
ultimately
chooses
to
define
that
duty,
whether
it
be
more
stringently
than
it
has
in
moore
and
brady.
there
must
be
a
breach
of
duty
before
a
new
a
trial
can
be
awarded
on
this
ground.
i
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
just
one
or
two
things
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
on
the
claim
that
this
evidence
was
admissible,
the
evans
case
was
completely
distinguishable.
what
was
held
in
evans
was
the
testimony
that
the
deceased
became
violent
when
drunk
as
he
was
at
the
time
of
his
death
was
admissible
to
show
his
character
for
violence.
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
the
question
here
is
how
do
you
show
character
for
violence?
can
you
show
character
for
violence
by
isolated
specific
acts?
i
wonder
if
the
defendant
or
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
taking
the
same
view
if
we
were
trying
to
show
that
the
defendant
was
the
aggressor
by
means
of
one
or
perhaps
it
is
two
--
that
is
not
what
the
opinions
indicate,
simple
assault
convictions.
in
any
event,
we
have
discussed
that
at
pages
6
to
9
of
our
brief
and
i
think
it
is
plain
that
the
evidence
was
inadmissible
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
the
time
or
certainly
was
not
plainly
admissible.
now,
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
argument
to
the
district
court
and
there
is
not
basis
for
assuming
that
he
was
lying,
he
explained
to
the
district
court,
this
is
at
page
148
of
the
appendix,
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
which
indicated
to
the
prosecution
that
the
record
of
the
decedent
was
in
anyway
favorable
or
usable
by
the
defense
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
would
say
quite
frankly
to
the
court
that
the
government’s
position
prior
to
burks
was
that
the
prior
record
of
the
decedent
was
not
admissible
in
evidence
unless
the
defendant
herself
knew
about
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
four
months
after
-
it
was
decided
three
months
after
in
october
1971.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
after
the
trial
and
conviction
in
this
case
and
even
in
burks,
it
was
burks
who
was
victim
and
i
believed
it
was
clearly
wrong
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
evan
case
was
10
years
earlier,
but
in
hayes
which
is
the
tenth
circuit
case
which
we
cite,
they
approved
evans.
they
say
if
the
defendant
did
not
know
about
it,
it
is
not
admissible.
if
the
defendant
did
know
about
it
is
admissible
not
because
it
tends
to
prove
a
propensity
for
violence
on
the
part
of
the
deceased,
but
because
of
the
subjective
state
of
mind
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
right.
i
know
the
red
light
is
on.
there
is
one
case
that
i
feel
obliged
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention.
it
was
not
discussed
in
our
briefs
and
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
griffin
which
was
in
336
u.s.
i
do
not
think
it
is
been
cited
by
either
party.
it
was
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion.
griffin
was
a
capital
case
and
in
the
last
footnote
in
justice
murphy's
dissenting
opinion
will
show
why
it
is
not
opposite
to
this.
