how
come
that
breached
up
to
this
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
said
it
should
not
be
kept
from
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap),
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
kept
from
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
never
asked
for
it.
it
was
not
denied
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
the
prosecutor
get
this
from,
this
information?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
same
--
the
defense
counsel
had
got
it
the
same
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
was
the
prosecutor
preventing
him
from
getting
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
he
asked
for
it,
did
he
give
it
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
the
defense
counsel
get
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
prosecutor
would
have
let
him
have
it.
now,
what
is
that
now
that
they
say
that
if
you
did
asked
for
it
early,
you
would
have
gotten
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bradley,
suppose
it
was
a
newspaper
clipping
that
this
man
had
been
convicted
of
having
a
knife,
that
is
all
the
prosecutor
had,
would
he
be
obliged
to
give
that
to
the
defense
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is,
is
there
anyway
further
you
go
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
said
that
the
defense
counsel
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
not
the
defense
counsel
say
you
got
any
reps
sheet
on
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
he
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
you
know,
defense
counsel
would
do
a
little
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
government
should
do
a
little
something.
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
why
you
take
position
that
the
government
should
do
everything
and
defense
counsel
is
excused
from
doing
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
getting
in
middle
there
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
could
better
understand
your
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
in
an
adversary
proceeding
defense
counsel
should
make
a
little
bit
of
investigation
of
his
own
case,
just
a
little
bit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
this
case
he
did
know
that
this
man
was
a
dangerous
man,
he
was
told
of
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
let
it
drop
deliberately,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bradley?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
counsel
just
sits
around
and
waits
four
months
later
and
then
goes
and
gets
material
(inaudible)
free?
