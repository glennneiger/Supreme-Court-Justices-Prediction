justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bradley,
before
you
get
too
deeply
into
this
case,
i
am
still
little
troubled
by
the
procedure
because
i
did
not
think
your
client
--
i
know
do
not
know
you
were
then
the
counsel
or
not,
discovered
this
evidence
until
almost
four
months
after
the
trial
was
over.
so
how
could
it
have
been
a
direct
appeal,
reversed
on
this
ground?
justice
john
paul
stevens
bradley
--
it
is
clearly
admissible
was
this
prior
evidence,
evidence
of
acts
of
violence?
is
evidence
of
possession
of
a
knife
and
evidence
of
an
act
of
violence,
is
that
not
the
holding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
actually
possession
of
knives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bradley?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
through,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
am
clear
on
the
admissibility
point.
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
record
showed
that
he
was
arrested
for
assault
and
pleaded
guilty
to
possession
of
the
knife.
now,
if
that
is
a
correct
understanding
of
the
record,
is
it
your
position
that
the
arrest,
that
information
would
also
been
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
75-491,
the
agurs
case,
the
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia.
three
months
after
a
jury
found
the
respondent
guilty
of
murdering
a
man
named
sewell,
respondent’s
lawyer
learned
that
sewell
had
a
criminal
record
which
if
it
had
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
jury,
might
have
supported
the
argument
that
respondent
had
killed
sewell
in
self
defense.
respondent
therefore
moved
for
a
new
trial
claiming
that
the
failure
of
the
prosecutor
voluntarily
to
provide
defense
counsel
with
sewell’s
prior
criminal
record
deprived
the
respondent
of
a
fair
trial.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reversed
holding
in
substance
that
the
information
might
have
affected
the
jury’s
appraisal
of
the
case.
this
court
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
we
know
that
this
not
a
case
in
which
there
is
any
claim
that
the
conviction
rests
on
perjured
testimony
or
that
the
prosecutor
failed
to
respond
to
a
specific
request
for
information.
in
a
case
such
as
this
in
which
the
only
claimed
breach
of
duty
by
the
prosecutor
was
a
failure
to
volunteer
exculpatory
information
to
the
defendant.
we
hold
that
material
information
must
be
delivered
by
the
prosecutor
to
the
defense,
but
that
the
test
of
materiality
is
whether
such
information
gives
rise
to
a
reasonable
doubt
about
the
guilt
of
the
defendant
that
would
not
otherwise
exist.
since
the
district
judge
in
this
case
made
it
clear
that
he
had
no
doubt
about
respondent’s
guilt
and
that
sewell’s
prior
criminal
record
was
merely
cumulative
of
information
already
disclosed
by
the
record,
he
properly
denied
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
reinstate
the
conviction.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joins.
