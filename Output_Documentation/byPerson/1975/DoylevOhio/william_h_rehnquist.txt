justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
client
is
free
and
you
are
free
to
argue
to
the
jury
that
no
inference
should
be
drawn
or
that
it
is
such
a
debatable
inference
that
he
may,
well
has
just
been
following
his
miranda
warning.
why
converted
it
into
a
question
of
law
rather
than
simply
something
that
the
jury
should
evaluate
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
you
are
penalizing?
i
mean
you
are
letting
a
lot
of
statements
made
by
the
defendant
to
a
third-party
at
the
trial,
you
do
not
regard
those
as
penalizing,
do
you?
