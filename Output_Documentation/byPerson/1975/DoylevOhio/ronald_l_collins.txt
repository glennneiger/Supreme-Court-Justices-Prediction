mr.
ronald
l.
collins
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
thought
that
we
had
complied
with
the
rule.
that
is
what
we
offer.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
your
honor,
i
had
expected
that
since
the
petitioners
had
come
in
here
in
the
form
of
a
popper
that
we
could
have
replied
in
kind
if
we
had
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
excuse
me?
[laughing]
excuse
me,
no.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
no,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court?
my
name
is
ronald
l.
collins.
i
am
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
tuscarawas
county,
ohio.
i
wish
to
deal
a
little
bit
with
the
facts
in
this
case
and
then
i
wish
to
stress
five
points
in
argument
for
clarification
and
amplification
of
the
written
brief
which
we
have
provided
the
court.
before
we
get
into
those
matters,
i
do
have
one
thing
to
indicate
to
the
court
less
the
court
please
on
do
emphasis
on
the
matters
as
brought
to
the
attention
of
court
by
mr.
willis,
the
defendant’s
being
sentenced
to
20-40
years
in
penitentiary.
as
the
court
is
aware
in
the
case
of
downey
versus
perini
which
has
been
sent
back
to
the
sixth
circuit
into
ohio
for
further
determination.
ohio
has
retroactively
changed
its
penalties
in
marijuana
cases
and
this
will
apply
to
these
defendants.
as
mr.
willis
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
facts
here
are
relatively
simple.
i
think
they
are
complicated
only
by
the
disbelieved
testimony
of
the
petitioners
to
the
defendants
below
and
that
they
are
very
important
facts
are
very
important
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
they
are
important
in
light
of
mr.
willis’s
concession
here
that
inconsistency
turns
this
case
and
that
ramirez
is
such
a
case.
we
contend
it
is
but
a
short
step
and
perhaps
even
backwards
from
ramirez
to
our
case.
in
the
facts
of
our
case,
on
april
28,
1973,
the
informant
notified
in
multi-county
narcotics
bureau,
which
is
the
local
bureau
in
our
county,
tuscarawas
county,
ohio
that
he
had
set
up
a
deal
with
one
of
the
defendants,
mr.
jefferson
doyle
to
purchase
a
quantity
of
marijuana
from
him.
the
deal
was
for
10
pounds
of
marijuana,
of
course
it
is
sackful
as
it
turned
out.
the
price
is
to
be
$175
a
pound
or
$1750
for
the
10
pounds.
the
bureau
had
trouble
getting
this
amount
of
money
and
on
the
short
notice
that
they
had,
however,
they
did
get
some
amount
of
it
$1520
or
$1540
as
i
recall
and
had
some
part
of
that
money
photocopied
so
that
they
had
the
serial
numbers.
the
informant
was
searched
so
that
they
found
no
drugs
on
him
and
the
surveillance
team,
in
fact
several
surveillance
teams
were
set
up
to
watch
the
informant
as
he
went
to
his
rendezvous.
the
photocopied
money
or
–
some
of
the
money
was
photocopied
and
all
was
what
given
to
him
including
the
photocopied
money
and
he
set
off
for
his
rendezvous
with
the
petitioners,
the
defendants
below.
the
exchange
was
made.
the
informant
gave
the
defendants
his
money
and
the
defendants
gave
the
informant
the
marijuana.
later,
after
search
warrant,
the
money
including
that
which
was
photocopied
was
found
in
the
rented
–
the
locked
rented
car
of
the
petitioners
bowled
up
under
the
floor
mat,
the
passenger
side
of
that
car.
had
trial
and
the
trial
testimony
of
the
defendants
they
testified
for
in
their
own
behalf
in
separate
trials
and
each
other’s
behalf
as
witnesses
in
the
separate
trials.
their
testimony
essentially
was
that
they
were
involved
in
this
matter
but
it
was
only
of
the
defendants,
mr.
doyle
who
wanted
to
buy
marijuana
not
to
sell
it
and
that
it
was
the
informant
who
i
might
pointed
out,
the
evidence
showed
knew
he
was
under
surveillance
at
the
time
this
rendezvous
took
place
was
framing.
the
informant
was
framing
by
the
defendants
that
the
marijuana
was
his
10
pounds
not
the
defendant’s.
that
the
money
--
how
did
they
explain
the
money
?well,
apparently
it
had
been
thrown
in
the
window
and
to
the
backseat
at
the
time
that
they
turned
down
the
deal
to
purchase
the
marijuana,
according
to
their
story.
then
it
was
their
testimonies
that
day
after
they
left
this
rendezvous,
they
discovered
this
money
in
the
backseat
and
think
scared,
not
knowing
what
to
do,
they
hid
it
under
the
floor
mat,
yes
they
did
hide
it.
and
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
well,
it
is
going
to
be
the
contention
as
i
get
to
it
in
my
argument
of
the
state
that
in
considering
the
question
of
consistency
or
inconsistency
was
the
silence
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
the
court
must
consider
the
nature
of
the
trial
testimony
and
what
i
am
saying
forth
here
is
the
nature
of
the
trial
testimony.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
petitioners
also
went
on
to
testify
in
their
part
of
their
case
that
they
were
trying
and
they
were
chasing
this
informant
after
they
found
that
money
to
find
out
what
is
going
on.
maybe
some
10
or
15,
20
minutes
and
after
they
had
driven
around
several
blocks,
say,
they
went
in
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
and
my
question
is,
where
they
perhaps
wanting
to
know
what
had
happened
to
the
other
$400
that
they
had
won
and
since
they
had
indicated
in
their
testimony
that
they
did
count
the
money.
at
this
point,
they
were
picked
up
and
they
did
not
talk
to
law
enforcement
officers
who
did
pick
them
up
who
had
found
out
about
this
through
the
informant
going
to
the
sheriff’s
department
and
later
a
radio
communication
telling
them
–
telling
the
other
officers
of
what
had
happen.
at
the
trial,
the
prosecutor
cross-examined
on
the
silence
of
the
defendants
at
the
time
they
were
arrested.
that
is
clear.
now,
in
argument,
i
would
like
to
stress
five
points.
first,
it
has
been
mentioned
what
is
being
penalized
by
the
persecutor’s
cross
examination.
i
want
to
deal
with
exactly
what
is
being
penalized.
second,
how
the
silence
of
the
defendants
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
became
meaningful
conduct
not
just
silence.
third,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
purpose
of
the
prosecutor’s
questions.
fourth,
the
inapplicability
of
miranda
and
fifth,
some
due
process
considerations--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
i
will
if
you
have
a
question,
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
i
think
not
because
--
i
think
that
the
preliminary
hearing
goes
along
with
the
same
kind
of
point
that
we
contend,
obtain
that
trial.
in
other
words,
that
the
prosecution
could
make
no
use
of
the
silence
of
the
defendants
in
their
case
and
chief
and
this
certainly
could
not
be
brought
up.
only
side
of
the
case
presented
preliminary
hearing,
the
states
case.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
occasions
since
the
defendants
did
not
take
a
stand
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
there
is
no
occasion
for
this
issue
to
come
up.
the
warning
that
the
court
gave
is
very
similar
to
the
warning
which
police
officers
given
to
miranda.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
yes,
in
particular
–
and
given
that
particular
fact
–
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
this
particular
trials
testimony.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
absolutely.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
i
said
that
it
is
not
in
the
case
that
they
took
a
stand.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
it
is
not
in
the
preliminary
hearing,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
well
that
absolutely
would
be
an
error.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
well
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
no.
i
do
not
think
griffin
applies
to
this
type
of
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
yes,
in
that
case
griffin
would
have
some
application.
i
think
what
makes
griffin
have
no
application
in
our
own
particular
case
is
the
fact
that
the
defendants
took
a
stand.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
that
is
correct.
i
think
miranda
compels
that.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
absolutely.
not
as
evidence
of
guilt
but
evidence
for
impeaching
purposes
that
his
story
--
the
stories
that
they
are
telling,
exculpatory
stories
are
layer
fabrications.
the
first
point
in
the
argument
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
about
penalizing
and
mr.
willis
and
the
petitioners
would
contend
that
the
state
and
by
the
questions
and
cross
examination,
that
the
state
was
penalizing
the
defendants
for
their
exercises
that
are
constitutional
privilege.
we
contend
that
if
there
is
any
penalty
at
all
that
there
was
not
a
penalty
for
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
privilege.
the
penalty
was
for
they
are
taking
the
stand
and
giving
this
fabrication,
this
fabricated
exculpatory
story.
if
they
had
not
taken
the
stand,
the
prosecution
could
not
have
said
a
thing
about
the
silence,
their
silence
at
the
time
of
their
arrest.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
no.
i
do
not
think
that
needs
to
be
done.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
i
am
arguing
that
when
the
trial
testimony
turns
out
to
be
inconsistent
with
silence
that
the
miranda
warning
means
nothing.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
no.
none
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
yes,
talking
is
inconsistent
with
silence.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
no.
i
think
the
court
–
the
trial
court
has
got
the
view,
it
is
factual
matter,
listened
to
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
which
exculpates
him
and
determine
whether
the
nature
of
that
testimony
is
such
as
it
would
cough
or
something
other
than
silence.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
yes.
i
would
point
out
the
hale
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
i
understand
that
but
i
am
talking
about
the
fact
pattern
in
the
hale
case
where
--
and
i
think
it
is
a
closed
case
but
the
factors
that
were
brought
out
in
that
trial
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
i
argued
that
in
the
written
brief.
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
well,
hale
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
well
i
am
not
saying
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
no.
i
think
it
has
to
be
due
process
and
i
think
due
process
considerations
would
come
down
on
our
side.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
ronald
l.
collins
well,
i
view
hale
as
not
reaching
the
constitutional
question
at
all
and
either
constitutional
question
on
due
process
or
fifth
amendment
and
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
case.
i
do
not
think
hale
was
at
fifth
amendment
case.
if
that
was
anything,
it
was
a
due
process
case
and
that
is
the
same
thing
i
think
this
is.
the
second
point
is
a
related
point
and
that
is
in
light
of
the
trial
testimony
of
the
defendants,
their
silence
at
the
time
of
their
arrest
became
conduct,
because
here
they
are
with
this
marked
money,
this
photocopied
money
in
their
car.
they
have
all
these
things
that
they
have
testified
to
and
then
which
were
set
out
in
detail,
and
i
do
not
want
to
dwell
on
the
facts
anymore,
which
made
them,
--
this
conduct
made
them
voiceless
in
the
presence
of
the
realities
that
they
were
facing.
a
third
point
is
related
to
this
as
well
that
the
prosecutor
asked
about,
and
this
has
been
a
question
before,
asked
about
the
defendant’s
silence
not
to
show
guilt
but
to
show
that
they
were
lying
on
the
witness
stand.
i
think
the
fourth
point
i
would
like
to
stress
here
is,
in
my
view,
miranda
has
no
proper
application
to
either
hale
or
to
this
case.
the
warnings
in
hale
and
in
this
case
were
given.
they
were
heeded.
the
defendants
said
nothing.
i
contend
that
there
is
a
different
line
of
cases
here,
entirely
separate
from
miranda.
raffel
versus
united
state,
grunewald
versus
united
state,
harris
versus
new
york
and
united
state
versus
hale.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
throughout
the
appellate
argument
at
this
case,
state
has
relied
on
the
language
in
harris.
i
think
the
prosecution
does
have
a
right
to
rely
on
the
language
in
harris,
some
of
which
shows
that
miranda
does
not
apply.
the
court
at
page
224
in
harris
had
said
some
comments
in
the
miranda
opinion
can
indeed
be
read
as
indicating
a
bar
to
use
of
an
uncounseled
statement
for
any
purpose.
the
discussion
of
that
issue
was
not
at
all
necessary
to
the
court’s
holding
and
cannot
be
regarded
to
this
controlling.
miranda
barred
the
prosecution
for
making
its
case
with
statements
of
an
accused
made
while
in
custody
prior
to
having
or
effectively
waiving
counsel.
it
does
not
follow
from
miranda
that
evidence
inadmissible
against
an
accused
in
the
prosecution’s
case
in
chief
is
barred
for
all
purposes
provided
of
course
that
the
trustworthiness
of
that
evidence
satisfies
legal
standards.
i
think
the
miranda
rationale
is
important
here
that
of
deterring
improper
police
conduct
and
getting
rid
of
coercion.
here,
the
conduct
of
the
police
was
entirely
proper.
they
gave
the
miranda
warnings.
it
was
no
compulsion,
no
element
of
compulsion
or
coercion
at
all.
the
petitioners,
the
defendants
made
their
free
choice
to
take
the
witness
stand
at
trial.
they
made
the
free
choice
to
remain
silent
at
the
time
of
their
arrest.
and
so
that
is
an
additional
reason
why
i
think
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
question
here.
there
is
no
element
of
compulsion.
there
is
no
compelling
at
all.
due
process
in
the
constitution
in
my
opinion
amount
to
fairness,
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
fair
about
presenting
a
lopsided
version
of
truth
to
the
jury.
i
think
that
the
defendants
in
this
case,
petitioners
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
tell
their
story
to
the
jury
on
impeded
by
being
impeached
by
things
which
would
go
directly
to
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
fabrication
or
not.
was
there
a
recent
fabrication
after
these
defendants
had
listened
to
the
state’s
case
throughout
the
preliminary
hearings,
throughout
discovery
procedures
and
trial
twice,
two
separate
trials?
i
think
the
jury
had
a
right
to
weigh
the
credibility
of
the
defendants
and
i
think
that
the
proper
--
the
prosecution
had
properly
used
the
silence
given
the
facts
and
the
nature
of
the
defendant’s
testimony
as
impeachment
as
showing
that
this
was
a
recent
fabrication
that
they
did
not
have
a
story
at
the
time
they
were
arrested
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
at
trial
they
do
have
a
story.
there
should
be
a
full
and
not
just
a
selective
development
with
the
recent
fabrication
and
credibility
issues.
thank
you.
