something
as
a
premise,
mr.
willis,
the
idea
that
the
silence
is
incriminating,
you
say
that
he
is
not
obliged
to
answer
because
this
tends
to
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
he
has
a
right
to
reserve
totally
any
statement
about
his
defense
until
he
is
in
open
court
with
his
counsel?

mr.
justice
jackson’s
often
quoted
observation
that
if
a
lawyer
has
called
in
any
lawyer
worthy
assault
will
tell
his
client
to
say
nothing
whatever.
in
the
miranda
opinion,
chief
justice
warren,
he
recalled
and
added
at
some
points
in
his
discussion
of
the
setting
that
we
are
talking
about
and
it
goes
on
to
say
it
can
be
assumed
that
in
such
circumstances,
that
is
when
a
lawyer
is
called
in
and
the
client
tells
the
lawyer
he
is
innocent
and
can
exculpate
himself,
his
statement
goes
on.
a
lawyer
would
advise
his
client
to
talk
freely
to
police
in
order
to
clear
himself.
certainly,
some
inconsistency
between
those
two
observations
of
the
two
justices?

either
one
is
a
ruling
of

but

observation.

(inaudible)
how
the
police
facts
relate
to
the
legal
constitutional
claims
presented
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.

claimed
not
all
silence
–
silence
may
not
be
used
to
impeach
under
all
circumstances
but
under
some
circumstances
and
that
this
is
one
of
the
cases
where
it
maybe
so
used.
chief

mr.
willis.
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
mr.
willis.
i
am
not
sure
whether
you
conceded
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens
that
in
some
circumstances
silence
might
have
a
probative
value
but
take
this
hypothetical
case.
a
setting
of
the
same
as
you
have
here
except
that
the
charge
is
inflicting
serious
injury
while
driving
an
automobile
under
the
influence
of
liquor.
three
men
in
the
car
and
at
a
point
after
insignificant
preliminaries,
the
policeman
turns
to
the
driver
who
has
furnished
his
driver’s
license
and
shown
that
he
is
the
owner
of
the
car,
you
are
now
under
arrest
for
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
liquor.
and
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
and
then
he
goes
along
with
the
usual
warning.
and
the
owner
of
the
car
makes
no
response.
then
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
he
appears
with
the
lawyer
and
makes
no
statement,
no
preliminary
response
at
all.
then
at
the
trial,
his
defense
says
he
was
not
driving
the
car
at
all.
he
was
sleeping
in
the
backseat
and
the
other
two
passengers
were
--
the
other
two
men
who
were
in
the
front
seat
and
one
of
them
driving.
would
you
say
that
the
silence
in
these
two
first
circumstances
or
either
of
them
is
inconsistent
with
innocence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.

case
is
