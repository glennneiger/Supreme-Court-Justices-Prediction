do
you
draw
the
distinction
between
instances
that
exist
at
the
time
of
arrest
when
the
miranda
warnings
are
given
and
those
that
exist
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
took
the
stand,
did
he
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
election
not
contested
by
or
offer
any
explanation
of
his
original
silence,
at
the
preliminary
hearing
it
was
a
trial
tactic
as
lawyers
would
perhaps
say.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
state
of
ohio
so
in
progress
that
it
can
not
afford
to
print
briefs
filed
in
the
united
states
supreme
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
complied
with
the
rule,
my
question
is
directed
that
to
the
fact
that
the
great
state
of
ohio
comes
to
our
court
with
a
that
has
not
printed,
whereas
most
people
who
do
appear
here
manage
to
find
the
means
to
print
their
briefs
and
it
just
puzzles
me.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
a
certain
right
to
do
it
under
the
rules
and
i
understand
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
these
two
criminal
cases,
involving
identical
circumstances
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio.
when
the
defendants
were
arrested,
they
were
given
the
customary
miranda
warnings.
these
included
advice
that
they
had
the
right
to
remain
silent,
that
anything
they
said
could
be
used
against
them
and
that
and
they
had
a
right
to
counsel
before
submitting
to
interrogation.
at
that
trial,
the
defendants
took
the
stand
and
offered
for
the
first
time
a
novel
explanation
of
their
conduct.
if
believed,
this
explanation
would
clear
them
of
criminality.
on
cross
examination,
the
prosecutor
pressed
defendants
as
to
why
they
had
not
advised
the
police
at
the
time
of
arrest
of
exculpatory
facts.
the
inference
sought
to
be
drawn
by
the
prosecutor,
was
that
defendant's
silence
at
the
time
of
arrest
indicated
that,
their
present
story
was
a
fabrication.
the
trial
court
allowed
the
cross
examination,
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction.
we
now
reverse.
when
as
required
by
law
an
arrested
person
is
advised
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
we
think
it
fundamentally
unfair
and
a
denial
of
due
process
to
allow
the
arrested
person's
silence
to
be
used
to
impeach
exculpatory
testimony
offered
at
the
trial.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
