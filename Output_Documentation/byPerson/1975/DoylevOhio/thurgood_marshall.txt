at
one
case,
once
you
lose
your
emotions
to
suppress
your
dead
pigeon
anyhow
so
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
did
not
make
a
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
ohio
did
not
make
a
(inaudible),
oh
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
the
prosecutor
argued
to
the
jury
that
he
did
not
talk
to
its
preliminary

justice
thurgood
marshall
the
question
is
why

justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the

is
that
you
hear
by

that
if
you
make
any
statements,
it
will
be
used
against
you
if
you
take
the
stand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
not
what
you

arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
are
arguing
is
once
he
takes
the
stand,
this
miranda
ruling
means
nothing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
once
he
takes
the
stand
and
testifies,
that
is
inconsistent,
is
it
not,
with
silence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
talking
is
inconsistent
with
silence,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
have
to
tell
him
that
that
if
you
test
--
whatever
you
tell
us,
we
will
use
against
you
if
he
takes
the
stand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
that
any
testimony
to
exculpatory
testimony
of
the
defendant,
they
would
not
justify
you
and
use
the
miranda?
