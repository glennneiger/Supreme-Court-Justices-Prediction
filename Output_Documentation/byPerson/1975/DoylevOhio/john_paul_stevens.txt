do
you
think
there
is
any
inconsistency
between
the
defendantâ€™s
silence
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
his
testimony
of
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
that
the
court
--
assuming
the
court
should
disagree
with
you
on
the
question
whether
there
is
inconsistency
or
not,
would
your
position
then
fail?
please
turn
on
the
question
whether
or
not
there
is
inconsistency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
could
ever
be
a
case
in
which
silence
would
be
inconsistent
with
trial
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
inconsistency
between
silence
at
his
later
trial
testimony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
the
officer
cannot
really
know
what
the
man
is
going
to
testify
to
later.
so
why
would
he
has
to
give
him
that
warning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
warning
about
your
silence
maybe
used
against
you.
did
you
say
your
silence
maybe
used
against
you
if
you
testify
later
in
a
way
inconsistent
with
silence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
circumstance,
so
which
would
be
permissible
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
question
on
the
facts.
it
was
the
defense
theory
at
the
trial
of
the
informant
had
framed
the
defendants
as
i
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
part
of
the
theory
that
the
arresting
officers
were
parties
to
the
frame?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is,
why
do
you
think
there
is
the
same
degree
of
inconsistency
between
failing
to
take
the
stand
at
the
preliminary
hearing
on
advice
of
counsel
and
the
failure
to
make
a
volunteered
statement
at
the
time
of
arrest?
