what
if
the
government
had
used
his
silence
on
each
side
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
griffin?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
why
not
--
if
the
defendant
was
silent
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
suppose
that
they
have
put
somebody
on
stand
and
said
well
he
did
not
take
the
stands
and
explain
anything,
it
is
preliminary
hearing
or
at
any
other
time
that
he
felt,
on
their
side
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let
us
suppose,
the
government
does
that
on
their
direct
side
of
the
case
and
then
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
they
impeach
him
or
they
ask
him
the
same
questions
about
his
preliminary
hearing.
were
you
silent
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
did
you
have
brief
explaining
this?
and
he
says
no.
now
you
say
that
is
permissible
but
using
it
on
their
side
of
the
case
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
suggesting
that
--
or
is
this
silent
just
for
impeachment
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
substantive
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hale
is
an
evidentiary
opinion,
just
the
fact
saying
this
testimony
was
not
inconsistent,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
were
applied
to
the
state,
what
would
you
say
the
constitutional
basis
would
be
for
applying
it
to
the
state?
due
process
that
just
silence
is
does
not
any
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
certainly
would
not
be
a
fifth
amendment
matter,
would
it?
