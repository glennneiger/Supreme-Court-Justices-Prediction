mr.
james
r.
willis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
jefferson
doyle
and
richard
wood,
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
were
convicted
and
sentenced
to
serve
penal
terms
of
20-40
years
for
the
sale
of
marijuana.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
consider
among
other
things,
the
question
left
unanswered
in
us
versus
hale
that
is
the
whether
constitution
prohibits
the
persecution
from
showing
that
one
who
had
been
advised
of
his
right
of
silence
end
up
his
right
of
counsel,
properly
subjects
himself
to
questions
designed
to
show
he
availed
himself
of
such
rights.
also
involved
here
are
serious
questions
as
to
whether
an
accused
can
be
asked
why
he
failed
to
disclose
his
defense
at
the
preliminary
hearing
where
he
appeared
with
counsel,
and
whether
a
defense
witness
arrested
and
charged
with
same
offense
can
be
asked
comparable
questions.
these
include
why
they
did
not
consent
to
a
search
of
the
car.
then
there
is
the
further
fact
that
these
points
where
vigorously
argued
to
the
jury.
the
relevant
facts
are
not
in
serious
dispute.
doyle
and
wood
were
arrested
shortly
after
they
had
been
seen
emerging
from
a
parking
lot.
an
informer
had
preceded
them;
he
was
carrying
a
10
pound
bag
of
marijuana
which
he
indicated
had
been
purchased
from
the
petitioners.
their
defense
was
that
they
had
been
framed.
the
fact
shows
that
they
had
driven
about
the
city,
according
to
their
defense,
in
search
of
the
person
who
had
framed
them
and
they
were
stopped
and
arrested
by
the
local
police
who
were
aided
by
the
sheriff’s
department.
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
viewed
the
asking
of
the
assailed
questions
as
properly
designed
to
test
credibility.
the
related
arguments
were
approved
on
the
basis
of
this
determination.
in
a
nutshell,
we
contend
here
that
to
the
extent,
raffel
may
have
somehow
survived
as
a
viable
concept,
this
court’s
decision
in
johnson,
grunewald
and
griffin
may
have
even
been
invigorated
by
harris.
this
court’s
decisions
in
miranda
and
hale,
certainly
when
viewed
in
tandem,
mandate
that
raffel
should
be
expressly
relegated
to
the
archives
of
antiquity.
the
state
and
the
government,
in
its
amicus
brief,
would
have
this
court
declare
in
spite
of
the
clear
and
ambiguous
thrust
of
miranda
and
griffin
that
the
failure
of
an
accused
base
on
his
right
of
silence
and
to
counsel
to
reveal
the
details
of
his
defense
during
police
interrogation
is
a
factor
that
bears
on
creditability.
while
it
is
doubtless
truth
that
the
grunewald,
hale
conclusion
that
mere
silence
is
not
inconsistent
with
innocence
is
a
valid
premise.
it
is
also
true
that
a
request
to
consult
with
counsel
should
not
create
a
negative
force
against
the
believability
of
exculpatory
defense
as
was
the
case
here.
raffel
of
course
held
that
it
was
proper
to
show
at
a
subsequent
trial
that
the
accused
did
not
testify
at
his
first
trial.
for
me,
it
is
most
difficult
to
square
raffel
with
the
griffin
principle
that
one
cannot
be
penalized
for
not
having
testified
and
the
elementary
fairness
concept
expressed
in
johnson
makes
the
fact
that
the
miranda
warnings
were
given
these
petitioners
a
most
crucial
consideration.
the
same
as
true
of
grunewald
as
it
is
hard
to
see
how
this
court’s
supervisory
powers
of
the
lower
federal
courts
could
possibly
be
more
sensitive
to
the
rights
of
an
accused
to
a
fair
trial
then
it
is
to
constitution
itself.
as
counsel
reads
hale
absent
a
on
a
duty
to
speak
and
absent
a
threshold
inconsistency
between
a
failure
to
do
so
and
later
exculpatory
testimony,
proof
of
silence,
lacks
a
significance
probative
value
and
should
be
excluded.
here
of
course,
as
was
the
case
in
grunewald,
the
focus
on
doyle
and
wood
following
their
arrest
was
so
intense
that
it
was
natural
for
them
to
feel
they
were
being
questioned
solely
for
the
purpose
of
providing
evidence
that
could
be
uses
against
them.
indeed,
there
is
simply
no
basis
in
this
record
even
for
the
strained
hope
by
them
that
the
revelation
of
their
defense
to
the
police
during
interrogation
could
have
possibly
resulted
in
their
arrest
--
in
their
release.
raffel,
of
course,
was
based
on
an
assumption
rejected
in
grunewald
and
again
in
hale
that
silence
is
inconsistent
with
a
later
exculpatory
defense.
but
as
the
court
has
recognized,
and
i
think
it
is
salient
here
that
there
is
simply
no
proof
that
an
innocent
person
would
tend
to
make
an
exculpatory
statement
whereas
the
guilty
person
will
remain
silent.
we
contend
that
it
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
rule
which
permits
the
conversion
of
one’s
permissible
use
of
fifth
amendments
shield
into
evidence
of
guilt.
this,
of
course,
is
the
point
made
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
grunewald
which,
we
contend,
was
adapted
in
griffin
and
certainly
impeachment
tends
to
demonstrate
it
is
untruth
by
implication
which
was
a
point
made
in
one
of
the
concurring
opinions
in
miranda.
the
interesting
aspect
of
this
case,
of
course,
lies
in
the
fact
that
in
ohio
there
were
decisions
which
had
expressly
excluded
the
ability
of
the
prosecutor
to
comment
on
the
failure
of
a
person
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
indicated
that
this
of
course
was
improper
and
then
no
amount
of
instruction
could
cure
of
this
fault
on
the
part
of
state.
there
were
decisions
which
indicated
it
was
impermissible
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
one
did
not
reveal
his
defense
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
again,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
take
into
position
that
any
instruction
was
insufficient
and
then
there
was
the
stevens
case
out
of
ohio
which
indicated
that
it
was
impermissible
to
argue
to
the
jury
that
at
a
point
of
arrest
would
have
been
a
good
time
for
the
defendant
to
have
revealed
his
exculpatory
defense.
there
was
a
statute
in
ohio
which
was
of
course
applicable
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
and
that
statute
expressly
provided
that
when
an
accused
person
appeared
at
a
preliminary
hearing
without
counsel,
he
should
be
expressly
advised
that
the
he
need
not
make
any
statement
and
the
failure
to
make
a
statement
could
not
be
used
against
him
at
the
time
of
trial.
thus,
we
have
the
anomalous
situation
where
one
appears
with
counsel
and
he
is
of
course
of
penalized
because
he
did
not
reveal
his
defense
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
to
put
the
issue
in
its
proper
context,
i
think,
that
a
slight
emphasis
should
be
given
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
mr.
wood
and
mr.
doyle.
the
point
of
course
is
that
doyle
was
tried
--
wood
was
tried
first,
doyle
appeared
as
a
witness
in
the
wood
case.
doyle
was
tried
and
wood
appeared
as
a
witness.
so
that
we
do
have
a
sophisticated
aspect
of
some
of
the
questions
which
deal
with
whether
or
not
the
same
standards
applied
to
a
witness
who
appears
testifying
in
the
defense
of
a
co-defendant
or
whether
or
not
the
fifth
amendments
right
of
silence
which
also
was
given
to
him
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
is
to
be
exposed
to
the
jury
to
impeach
his
credibility
when
he
appears
as
a
witness.
the
trial
court
in
ruling
on
emotion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
a
post
trial
indicated
that
different
rules
applied.
we
contend
that
the
rights
have
not
been
given
to
both
these
defendants
and
both
having
indicated
that
they
desired
to
rely
on
their
rights
and
they
wanted
to
consult
with
an
attorney,
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
he
appears
at
the
post
trial
--
whether
he
appears
at
the
trial
post
indictment.
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
he
appears
as
a
witness
or
as
a
defendant
that
the
implications
are
exactly
the
same.
in
this
case,
when
doyle
and
wood
were
stopped,
the
officer
indicated,
and
it
is
a
fact
that
he
told
them
they
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
they
have
right
to
consult
an
attorney.
both
indicated
that
they
wanted
to
consult
an
attorney.
later,
they
came
to
the
incarceration
area
and
indicated
to
wood,
you
do
not
have
any
objections
to
us
searching
your
car.
he
said
i
want
to
consult
with
an
attorney
about
that
and
that
was
his
evidence
on
the
point,
and
doyle
of
course
gave
comparable
indications.
then,
of
course,
the
state
then
went
to
the
problem
of
getting
a
search
warrant
and
they
located
in
the
car
some
money
and
of
course
they
were
asked
at
the
trial,
why
did
you
not
consent
to
the
search
of
the
car
and
why
was
it
that
you
did
not
reveal
this
frame
defense
to
the
police
on
the
night
of
the
arrest?
why,
when
you
appeared
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
did
you
not
reveal
the
contents
of
your
defense?
and
the
question
about
the
counsel
was
brought
before
by
questions
asked
of
one
of
the
petitioners
is
why
did
you
not
relate
the
essence
of
your
defense
and
he
indicated
that
i
wanted
to
consult
with
an
attorney.
so
while
you
appeared
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
you
had
an
attorney
at
that
time,
did
you
not?
and
he
said
yes.
and
why
did
you
not
tell
the
judge
at
that
preliminary
hearing
that
you
have
been
framed
and
would
that
not
have
been
a
wonderful
time
to
have
revealed
to
the
judge
that
you
have
been
framed.
and
all
these
questions
of
course
were
asked
over
objections.
the
only
instruction
given
to
court
related
to
the
testimony
of
one
who
appeared
on
as
rebuttal
witness
in
the
wood
trial,
he
was
asked
on
the
rebuttal
that
mr.
wood,
at
anytime,
protests
his
innocence.
and
we
again
objected
and
the
court
indicated
that
--
did
mr.
doyle
at
anytime
protests
his
innocent.
doyle
testifying
as
a
witness
in
the
wood
trial,
and
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
that
went
to
impeach
the
credibility
of
mr.
doyle
who
had
appeared
as
a
witness
on
behalf
of
mr.
wood.
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
r.
willis
do
i
see
any
inconsistency?
mr.
james
r.
willis
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
see
none.
i
feel
that
the
constitution
having
as
interpreted
by
miranda
having
conferred
upon
the
accused,
the
absolute
right
to
remain
silent,
i
see
no
inconsistency
between
that
and
the
position
taken
by
this
court
in
the
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
would
say
so,
in
the
line
of
harris
versus
new
york,
the
position
taken
by
the
court
there
of
course
related
to
inconsistent
statements,
which
were
at
variance
with
the
later
defense.
i
think,
although
i
am
not
in
agreement
necessarily
with
harris,
but
given
harris,
i
do
not
think
that
this
case
would
turn
on
that
point
because
here
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
would
suppose
so.
using
the
third
circuit’s
case
of
usl,
the
bird
case,
whatever
it
is,
there
the
indication
was
that
the
man
was
arrested
and
at
sometimes
after
a
person
had
been
killed
and
later
he
was
charged
with
a
murder
and
his
defense
was
accident
and
he
was
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not
why
he
had
not
reported
the
fact
that
he
had
accidentally
injured
someone.
i
think
in
that
instance,
at
least
i
could
live
with
that
opinion.
and
there
is
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
in
ramirez
whether
person
testified
a
trial
that
he
was
coerced
in
selling
the
contraband.
i
think
there,
i
can
see
how
he
might
have
been
under
some
duty
to
speak,
and
i
think
that
is
the
point,
absent
a
duty
to
speak.
i
have
problems
with
it
and
i
have
even
greater
problems
when
the
man
has
given
the
miranda
warning
which
is
to
the
effect
that
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent.
and
i
think
that
he
certainly
can
rely
on
that.
and
there
is
an
old
opinion
rendered
by
in
the
sixth
circuit
i
think
it
is
the
mccarthy
and
it
is
probably
back
in
the
20s.
and
the
point
there
was
made
that
if
a
person
could
be
penalized
for
exercising
his
right
of
silence
that
you
have
to
change
the
warning
to
read
that
anything
that
you
say
can
be
used
against
you
and
if
you
do
not
say
anything
that
can
be
used
against
you
too.
and
i
think
that
makes
sense.
it
just
seems
that
there
is
something
wrong
to
tell
a
man
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
you
have
the
right
to
consult
with
an
attorney.
and
he
says
very
good,
i
want
to
exercise
those
rights.
and
then
later,
he
is
penalized
for
having
done
so.
i
just
cannot
reconcile
that
with
the
position
taken
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
johnson
not
can
i
take
it
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
inconsistency,
but
i
do
not
accept
that
the
premise
that
silence
is
necessarily
–
mr.
james
r.
willis
well
the
court
said
he
must
be
warned
in
miranda,
and
i
am
relying
on
that.
this
court
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
but
i
am
not
agreeing
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
admit
that
some
of
the
decisions
tend
to
suggest
that
this
is
the
case.
again,
the
third
circuit
current
opinion
in
bird
and
ramirez’s
decision
out
of
the
out
fifth
circuit
tends
to
say
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
silence
is
inconsistent
with
innocence
and
with
later
exculpatory
testimony
and
for
that
reason
is
admissible.
but
i
think
for
that
reason,
this
court
ought
to
articulate
standard
under
which
all
of
us
can
live.
and
i
believe
that
is
one
of
the
real
problems
that
confronts
defense
council.
we
recall,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
jackson
in
watts
versus
indiana
indicated
that
any
lawyer,
worth
his
so,
will
advice
his
client
not
to
make
any
statement
on
any
circumstance.
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
i
think
this
position,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
any
defendant
who
does
not
testify
goes
against
the
grant.
and
certainly
if
you
cannot
penalize
him
for
not
testifying
to
a
jury
in
open
court,
why
should
you
penalize
him
because
he
does
not
desire
to
risk
distortion
by
the
police
officers
as
to
what
he
might
have
said
when
questioned
on
the
public
highway.
and
for
that
reason
and
because
the
drift
as
i
apprehend
from
the
court’s
decisions
is
that
he
has
this
right
to
remain
silent,
why
should
he
be
penalized?
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
i
do
not
say
he
is
being
penalized
but
i
think
he
properly
subjects
himself
to
a
testimony
that
tends
to
prove
him
guilty
when
it
is
provided
by
others.
but
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
says
he
does
not
have
to
provide
any
testimony
himself
which
is
incriminating,
and
this
is
at
least
the
thrust
to
the
position
i
am
trying
to
defend.
certainly,
i
do
not
see
how
one
can
conclude
that
because
a
person
is
told
he
can
remain
silent
and
he
decides
to
remain
silent,
that
he
must
be
guilty
and
that
this
has
some
evidentiary
value
insofar
as
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
is
concerned.
mr.
james
r.
willis
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
--
i
am
not
necessarily
saying
that
if
i
am
then
i
am
not
--
what
i
am
trying
to
say,
i
am
not
saying
very
well.
what
i
am
really
trying
to
say
is
that
this
court,
as
indicated
in
miranda
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
he
has
to
be
told
of
this,
and
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
and
he
has
to
be
told
of
this.
now
that
seems
to
me
that
there
is
something
basically
unfair
to
then
turn
that
around
and
penalize
him
by
exposing
to
the
jury
that
he
elected
to
remain
silent
when
he
had
an
option
which
would
have
permitted
him
to
waive
these
constitutional
rights
and
reveal
to
this
police
officers,
possibly
in
some
secret
session
or
in
present
of
five
or
six
other
police
officers
who
may
very
well
distort
what
he
has
to
say.
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
reveal
his
defense
in
an
open
court
where
it
can
be
fully
evaluated.
mr.
james
r.
willis
that
is
it.
that
is
precisely
the
point.
i
feel
that
he
has
no
duty
to
speak
when
interrogated
by
the
police
officers
and
i
think
this
court
has
made
that
point
very
clear.
and
this
is
the
point
that
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
made
in
johnson
when
the
particular
defendant
was
told
by
the
court
that
he
could
refuse
to
answer
questions
based
on
his
right
on
this
fifth
amendment
rights.
and
then
later,
the
prosecutor
was
able
to
argue
that
the
man
had
exercised
his
right
of
silence.
certainly,
something
fundamentally
wrong
to
penalize
a
person
for
having
exercised
the
right
that
you
extended
to
him,
and
this
is
the
point
upon
which
i
place
my
basic
emphasis.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes,
and
i
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
this
is
the
point
i
was
going
to
make.
i
think
that
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
warren,
of
course,
was
dicta
and
it
certainly
--
i
do
not
agree
with
that
particular
statement
and
i
feel
that
as
counsel
for
a
person
who
is
on
the
accusation
that
i
have
the
choice
of
giving
him
the
advice
which
i
considered
to
be
consistent
with
the
client’s
best
interest.
i
think
that
that
is
traditionally
the
role
that
defense
counsel
has
to
bear
when
he
assumes
the
obligation
of
defending
one
accused
to
crime.
i
see
nothing
improper
in
indicating
to
a
person
against
whom
there
is
a
raid,
some
suspicious
circumstances
that
he
should
exercise
his
right
to
reserve
as
the
court
has
indicated
his
right
to
defend
against
these
judges
in
open
court.
particularly,
when
the
likelihood
that
if
he
were
to
make
all
sorts
of
exculpatory
statement
is
not
going
to
result
in
this
illusion
elision
in
any
way.
in
any
event
are
void
the
problem
going
to
trial
then
having
the
issue
decided
by
a
jury.
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes.
in
this
case
i
do
because
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
man
appeared
with
counsel
and
certainly,
if
he
retains
counsel,
you
ought
to
follow
counsel’s
advice.a
nd
at
that
point,
we
can
assume
that
the
counsel
had
evaluated
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
in
this
particular
case,
he
conducted
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
which
had
been
defeated
and
the
likelihood
was
good
that
the
man
was
going
to
get
indicted
by
the
grand
jury.
also,
we
had
the
state
statute
which
expressly
indicated
that
if
a
person
had
appeared
without
counsel,
the
court
had
to
advice
them
that
they
need
not
make
any
statements
and
their
failure
to
make
any
statements
could
not
be
used
against
them
at
the
time
of
trial.
so,
are
we
to
say
that
counsel
cannot
give
the
same
advice
to
his
clients
that
the
court
would
be
required
to
give
within
he
appeared
without
counsel?
i
hope
that
answers
the
court’s
question.
mr.
james
r.
willis
at
the
trial,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
i
would
not
certainly
call
it
mr.
justice,
a
trial
tactic
although
it
probably
results
in
being
just
that.
the
point
was
it
would
have
been
futile
for
him
to
have
testified
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
burden
there
is
only
a
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
person
was
implicated
in
some
crime
and
is
then
up
to
the
grand
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
should
be
indicted.
so
the
likelihood
of
him
forestalling
this
situation
at
that
point
was
too
remote
for
him
to
even
involve
himself
in
trying
to
explain
his
particular
defense
at
that
time.
mr.
james
r.
willis
in
simple
--
oh
yeah,
so
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned,
yes.
i
would
like
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
--
yes?
mr.
james
r.
willis
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
r.
willis
not
precisely.
no
i
do
not
--
i
would
say
no.
that
was
not
a
part
of
the
defense.
the
point
was
that
the
particularly
informants
had
already
been
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
and
he
had
been
brought
back
and
was
out
on
bail
pending
a
habeas
corpus
ruling
and
he
sought
out
this
officers
that
he
happen
to
try
to
do
something
to
help
himself.
he
admitted
this
much.
mr.
james
r.
willis
and
we
were
concerned
that
he
was
trying
to
get
these
people
to
go
penitentiary
in
his
place.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
innocence
and
i
would
like
to
correct
any
impression
that
i
may
have
given.
i
did
not
concede
that
there
were
any
circumstances
in
which
silence
could
be
inconsistent
with
innocence.
i
indicated
that
there
were
some
cases,
burt
versus
new
jersey
and
ramirez
where
the
court
took
the
position
that
in
those
circumstances,
it
was
inconsistent
with
innocence.
i
said
i
could
see
how
the
court
came
to
that
conclusion
although
i
do
not
agree
with
it,
but
i
am
indicating
that
this
case
is
not
even
--
does
not
fall
in
that
field.
this
is
different
case
in
its
entirety.
my
position
is
that
silence
can
never,
following
the
warnings
that
that
eliminates
any
duties
or
impose
that
the
accused
might
otherwise
have
to
explain
incriminating
circumstances
and
that
he
has
a
right
to
rely
on
the
warnings
given
to
him
by
miranda,
and
that
would
apply
across
the
board
in
all
cases.
that
is
the
position
i
have
attempted
to
assert
here.
certainly,
if
these
defendants
had
the
right
to
remain
silent,
then
the
police
did
not
have
the
right
to
create
any
evidence
out
of
their
exercise
of
the
right
to
remain
silent.
i
feel
that
this
court’s
decision
in
hale
ought
to
be
applied
full
strength
to
the
facts
in
the
factual
pattern
involved
here.
certainly,
we
have
to
concern
ourselves
about
them
asking
these
petitioners
about
consenting
to
the
search
of
the
car.
i
feel
that
they
do
not
have
to
consent
to
the
search
of
the
car
or
ask
mr.
wood
about
this.
he
was
the
lesser
of
the
car
and
he
indicated
i
want
to
discuss
that
with
my
attorney.
now,
how
can
you
then
torture
that
legitimately
in
the
light
of
grunewald
and
these
other
cases
than
to
some
evidence
that
can
be
used
against
these
particular
petitioners?
i
feel
that
the
court
ought
to
follow
the
suggestion
made
by
mr.
justice
black
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
grunewald
and
ought
to
eliminate
raffel
from
the
books
of
this
court
as
a
viable
opinion.
thank
you.
