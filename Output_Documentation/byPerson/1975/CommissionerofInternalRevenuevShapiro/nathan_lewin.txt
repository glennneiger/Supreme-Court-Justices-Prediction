mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
as
matters
develop
subsequent
to
mr.
shapiro’s
return
to
israel,
it
is
true
that
that
factor
was
dropped
out
of
the
case.
he
is
now
on
bail.
mr.
nathan
lewin
at
the
time,
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
the
case
that
was
the
basis
that
we
were
relying
on
to
establish
irreparable
injury.
however,
we
think
that
if
we
were
back
in
the
district
court
today,
we
could
demonstrate
irreparable
injury
from
the
fact
that
i
think
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
which
is
that
all
of
these
man’s
assets
in
the
united
states
are
presently
being
held
by
the
internal
revenue
service
which
means
that
he
is
not
able
to
pay
counsel
to
litigate
the
tax
claim
that
he
suffers
the
same
kind
of
irreparable
injury
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
held,
for
example,
in
the
village
case
which
we
cite
an
hour
brief
and
the
sherman
case,
third
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
have
both
held
that
jeopardy
assessments
which
essentially
forfeit
a
man’s
entire
assets,
deprive
him
of
the
possibility
of
living
during
that
period
of
time,
do
constitute
irreparable
injury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
representation
that
we
made
to
the
district
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
he
may
bail
because
a
relative
came
forward
at
the
last
moment
and
posted
in
apartment
as
security,
a
relative
who
had
no
legal
obligation
to
mr.
shapiro,
but
simply
out
of
a
family
feeling
rather
than
seeing
him
in
jail
for
an
extended
period.
i
might
point
out
in
that
regard.
mr.
baum
has
said
that
he
had
an
urgent
appointment
for
criminal
prosecution
in
israel.
in
fact,
he
has
not
even
been
put
to
trial
by
this
date
in
israel.
he
is
out
on
bail
this
entire
period
of
time.
and
if
indeed,
i
might
say
in
that
regard,
if
indeed
the
united
states
thought
that
mr.
shapiro
had
some
evidence
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
kind
of
conduct
that
they
allege
at
the
last
minute
at
the
eleventh
hour
in
the
civil
proceeding,
we
submit
they
could
very
usually
have
asked
the
israeli
authorities
to
defer
any
extradition
so
that
they
could
institute
criminal
narcotics
proceedings
against
him.
that
was
not
done
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
it
is
not
done
is
a
factor
that
this
court
ought
to
consider
in
determining
the
question
of
good
or
bad
faith
or
whether
there
is
at
least
enough
of
a
colorable
or
enough
ground
for
questioning
good
faith
to
have
a
district
court
look
into
this
issue.
now
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
your
honor.
i
think
we
are
arguing
in
affirmance
because
the
court
–
what
i
think…
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
the
court
of
appeals
has
remanded
for
further
considerations
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
for
further
proceedings.
now,
if
subsequent
developments
in
the
course
of
litigation
are
such
that
the
further
proceedings
warrant,
either
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
to
allege
a
different
form
of
irreparable
injury,
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
do
that.
we
certainly
think
we
are
entitled
to
a
remand
and
that
is
what
is
before
the
court
at
the
present
time.
the
government
is
asking
for
an
affirmance,
essentially
a
recessive
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
an
affirmance
of
the
dismissal.
we
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
on
various
issues.
and
i
think
that
what
the
government
overlooks
is
that
there
are
three
different
issues
in
this
case,
which
should
be
available
to
us
in
the
district
court.
one
is
the
procedural
issue,
which
i
think
i
almost
understood
mr.
baum
to
concede
is
an
appropriate
issue
if
raised
by
the
pleadings
and
if
properly
presented
to
the
district
court.
now,
we
said
in
a
complaint,
and
it
is
very
clear
on
the
complaint,
that
there
was
no
notice
or
demand
before
the
seizure
of
these
assets
on
december
6,
that
appears
at
paragraph
18
which
is
page
11
of
the
appendix.
now,
mr.
baum
says
--
affidavit
subsequently
submitted
to
the
district
courts
says
that
this
notice
was
set
out
and
in
fact,
he
says,
“there
is
a
copy
of
that
that
appears
in
our
brief
in
pages
12a
to
13a.”
we
pointed
out
in
that
hearing
in
the
district
court
that
that
affidavit
was
the
taxpayer’s
copy
to
which
mr.
baum
responds
as
the
trial
counsel
date
in
the
district
court,
well,
that
was
just
simply
produced
from
the
computer
records.
well,
the
interesting
thing
which
i
do
not
think
comes
out
quite
clearly
on
the
photo
stat
in
the
brief,
is
that
the
copy
has
a
jagged
edge,
at
least
the
copy
that
we
received,
which
certainly
makes
it
look
as
if
it
was
torn
off
from
some
other
copies.
these
forms
is
i
have
seen
them,
as
the
taxpayer
have
several
copies
that
you
can
tear
off
the
top.
the
taxpayer
tears
off
the
top,
keeps
it,
sends
back
the
second
copy.
it
looks
to
me
if
we
would
have
a
hearing
that
we
might
very
well
develop
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
in
its
records
the
physical
copy
that
should
have
been
sent
to
mr.
shapiro
and
never
was.
now,
if
in
fact
that
is
true,
then
there
was
no
proper
jeopardy
assessment
under
section
6861
and
the
introductory
language
to
the
anti-injunction
act
which
says,
“accept
for
section
6213a,
there
may
not
be
an
injunction.”
it
would
apply
because
the
exception
would
apply.
6213a
says
that
the
only
time
that
you
can
fail
to
follow
the
procedure
in
6213a
is
with
a
proper
jeopardy
assessment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
of
the
complaint
alleges
though
raises
those
issues
and
they
are
not
answered
by
the
government’s
pleadings
or
indeed
we
submit
by
any
subsequent
submission.
we
are
not
disputing
the
procedural
question
of
whether
the
court
may
look
to
maybe
the
subsequent
hearing.
the
government
has
lodged
the
hearing.
we
certainly
do
not
want
pirate
(ph)
victory
in
this
court.
we
are
not
interested
in
coming
here
and
taking
the
court’s
time
to
get
a
rule
that
says
well,
if
the
government
files
what
it
filed
in
that
subsequent
hearing,
the
case
is
over.
we
think
that
that
is
not
true.
in
fact,
i
think
that
what
the
facts
develop
really
is
that
the
basis
for
the
government’s
claim
that
the
taxpayer
was
unnoticed
was
a
notice
of
deficiency
served
on
him
at
12:20
pm
on
the
date
that
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
the
judge
said,
“i
will
be
reconvene
court
at
3:00
pm
on
friday
afternoon,
december
21.
at
12:20
pm,
we
received
as
counsel,
copies
of
this
notice
of
deficiency
which
for
the
first
time
said,
“this
man
is,
in
the
government’s
view,
a
dealer
in
narcotics.”
the
government
rather
extraordinarily
says,
“in
light
of
that
with
mr.
shapiro
being
in
new
york,
being
of
the
orthodox
jewish
faith,
unable
to
come
to
washington
to
appear
at
a
hearing
in
response
to
that,”
his
counsel
came
into
court
saying
that
mr.
shapiro
was
called
on
the
phone
and
denies
this.
the
government
says
in
its
brief,
“the
only
thing
that
the
respondent
did
was
have
one
of
his
counsel
tell
the
district
court
the
respondent
had
advised
another
of
his
counsel
that
the
commissioner’s
determination
of
income
from
narcotics
dealings
was
false.”
well,
that
is
all
that
he
could
do
in
the
two
hours
and
forty
minutes
that
he
had
before
the
district
judge
turned
around
and
said
that
the
case
is
dismissed.
thereafter,
mr.
shapiro
filed
a
verified
petition
in
the
tax
court
in
which
he
denied
being
a
narcotics
dealer.
thereafter,
at
the
hearing
which
mr.
baum
refers
to,
he
filed
an
extended
petition
in
the
district
court
which
said,
“i
am
not
a
narcotics
dealer.”
indeed.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked,
“what
would
happen
if
the
taxpayer
came
back
with
an
affidavit
or
a
document
that
established
where
he
had
received
the
funds.”
that
is
exactly
what
mr.
shapiro
did
in
the
hearing
in
the
district
court,
the
record
of
which
has
been
lodged
with
this
court.
we
filed
an
affidavit
from
a
resident
of
switzerland
who
had
described
in
detail
that
she
had
held
cash
from
mr.
shapiro
while
he
was
in
switzerland
and
that
she
sent
it
over
to
the
united
states.
all
of
that
is
in
the
record
in
the
district
court.
it
is
referred
to
in
that
transcript
that
has
been
lodged
with
the
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
if
he
had
it
in
switzerland
before
he
came
here,
i
think
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
she
had
it
in
1970
before
he
arrived
in
the
united
states
and
she
had
it
at
that
time
and
he
then
came
to
the
united
states
and
she
sent
it
to
him
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
your
honor.
our
view
is
that
if
we
are
entitled
to
something
other
than
merely
arbitrary
action
on
the
part
of
the
government,
there
has
to
be
some
minimal
showing
before
the
government
can
seize
a
man’s
entire
assets.
mr.
justice
brennan
spoke
with
the
probable
cause
hearing.
the
fourth
amendment
says,
“you
cannot
seize
a
man’s
papers
or
effects
without
probable
cause
when
you
got
criminal
allegations
against
him.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
this
court’s
rulings,
whether
it
is
fuentes
and
shevin
or
substantial
other
cases
have
said
that
there
has
to
be
a
meaningful
hearing
attached
to
that
and
only
in
extraordinary
circumstances
may
the
hearing
follow
the
seizure.
now,
we
are
not
challenging
the
fact
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
authority
in
appropriate
circumstances
to
take
the
extraordinary
step
of
a
jeopardy
assessment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
we
did.
we
said
--
our
basic
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
one
that
we
argued
there
and
i
think
we
argued
in
the
district
court,
was
a
variety
of
constitutional
arguments.
one
was,
i
guess
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
referred
to,
the
government
on
the
one
hand
excluding
a
man
for
the
country
and
on
the
other
hand,
seizing
all
of
his
assets.
but
if
what
you
mean
by
these
constitutional
arguments
is
the
fact
that
there
should
be
some
minimal
showing
on
the
part
of
the
government,
i
think
we
did
raise
that
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
but
pursuant
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
what
the
united
states
certainly
was
doing
and
we
----
let
me
correct
that
if
i
might.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
the
result
of
the
treaty
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
was
to
keep
him
from
being
able
to
litigate
the
tax
claim.
true,
it
was
fulfilling
a
treaty
obligation,
but
there
were
times
it
seems
to
us
when
the
government
maybe
has
to
make
a
hard
choice
and
it
does,
so
i
suppose
in
all
extradition
cases.
if
it
fulfills
a
treaty
obligation,
it
may
end
up
in
some
circumstances
in
a
position
where
it
is
more
difficult
for
it
to
collect
a
tax
liability
and
we
did
raise
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
although
that
is
not
been
no
how.
we
think
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
sustained
on
the
very
narrow
grounds
that
the
court
of
appeals
took.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
our
broad
constitutional
argument
and
rule
4.
they
simply
said,
“there
is
enough
here
for
a
remand
to
the
district
court.”
but,
we
did
argue
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
continue
to
think
that
it
is
right
that
if
the
government
puts
a
man
in
a
position
where
he
cannot
litigate
the
tax
claim,
particularly
when
that
claim
is
based
as
it
is
here
on
an
allegation
that
he
committed
a
criminal
conduct,
which
is
really
very
hard
to
fight
in
absentia,
they
may
not
at
the
same
time
seek
to
forfeit
all
of
his
assets
on
that
tax
claim.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
would.
but,
we
think
that
the
difficulty
with
the
government’s
theory
and
the
government’s
approach
in
this
case
is
that,
if
the
government
is
able
to
use
an
allegation
of
criminal
violation
as
a
basis
for
a
jeopardy
assessment
and
then
cut
off
all
litigation
of
the
basis
for
that
kind
of
a
claim
by
citing
the
anti-injunction
act,
it
opens
up
the
door
for
the
internal
revenue
service
to
become
the
prosecutor
of
all
kinds
of
criminal
offenses
because
clearly,
most
criminal
offenses
in
the
united
states
are
committed
for
private
gain
and
if
so,
the
fruit
of
that
criminal
offense
is
taxable.
i
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
any
question.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
he
did.
mr.
nathan
lewin
his
own
affidavit.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
am
sorry.
it
is
in
the
record
of
the
district
court.
that
affidavit
was
filed
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
there
was
an
earlier
affidavit.
there
was
an
earlier
affidavit
which
was
filed
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
allegations
of
criminality
that
were
made.
you
see
the
difficulty
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is.
there
is
an
affidavit
on
pages
20
to
21
of
the
appendix.
and,
it
does
say
in
paragraph
4,
“before
arriving
in
the
united
states,
i
had
made
successful
investments
in
europe
and
had
funds
at
that
time,
part
of
which
i
brought
with
me
and
the
other
portions
of
which
were
brought
to
me
after
i
arrived
in
the
united
states.
i
can
establish
this
fact
by
documentation
and
by
the
testimony
of
witnesses
and
would
be
prepared
to
do
so
in
a
bona
fide
inquiry
into
my
tax
obligations.”
of
course,
that
did
not
refer
to
narcotics
allegation
because
there
were
no
narcotics
allegation
made
at
that
point.
mr.
shapiro
was
not
alleged
to
be
a
narcotics
dealer
at
that
point.
it
was
only
at
the
eleventh
hour
before
the
district
court
was
about
to
rule
that
that
allegation
was
made.
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
kind
of
allegation
that
the
subsequent
affidavit
was
filed
in
the
later
hearing.
now,
i
think
i
pointed
out
that
as
to
procedure,
i
think
that
is
one
issue
that
has
open
in
the
district
court.
the
second
issue
which
we
believe
is
open
in
the
district
court
is
simply
the
question
of
good
faith
and
i
think
that
this
court’s
decisions
on
enochs
and
in
bob
jones
make
it
clear
that
that
is
a
legitimate
issue
that
can
be
raised
even
under
the
anti-injunction
act.
in
enochs,
this
court
said,
page
7
of
370
u.s.,
to
require
more
than
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government
would
unduly
interfere
with
the
objective
of
protecting
the
collector
from
suing.
so
implicit
in
that
was
that
good
faith
was
an
element
of
what
the
collector
of
internal
revenue
had
to
establish.
the
same
thing
was
true
with
language
in
bob
jones.
i
think
at
page
740,
the
court
said,
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
position,
the
position
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
does
not
represent
a
good
faith
effort
to
enforce
the
technical
requirements
of
the
tax
laws.
again,
there
has
to
be
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
commissioner.
now,
we
are
not
in
a
position
where
we
are
simply
a
taxpayer
who
has
gone
through
a
tax
audit,
the
usual
procedure
with
the
internal
revenue
service
and
then
comes
in
at
the
last
minute
and
says,
“well,
you
are
proceeding
in
bad
faith.
there
are
substantial
indicia
simply
from
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
this
jeopardy
assessment
was
not
a
good
faith
collection
of
revenue
measure.”
the
waiting
until
the
last
minute
and
i
think
if
the
government
tries
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
what
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
what
i
am
referring
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
internal
revenue
service
was
attempting
to
use
an
assessment
as
a
basis
for
prosecuting
or
harassing
what
the
government
believed
to
be
someone
who
violated
a
criminal
law.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
government’s
good
faith
effort
has
to
be
to
collect
revenue.
that
is
what
it
has
to
be.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
with
all
deference,
i
think
not
so
if
the
government’s
whole
claim
is
based
on
an
allegation
of
criminality
which
should
be
pursued
by
other
agencies
of
the
government.
otherwise,
every
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
i
think
that,
i
guess
al
capone,
the
government
could
not
try
to
use
a
jeopardy
assessment
as
a
substitute
for
a
criminal
prosecution
and
i
think
that
that
is
what
is
being
done
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
it
may
pursue
the
tax
liability
and
i
think
that
it
may
pursue
it
jointly.
but
here,
it
is
in
a
peculiar
position
of
having
a
man
who
they
know
is
going
to
be
extradited.
the
government
says,
“well,
we
just
found
that
out.”
i
think
its
own
answers
to
the
interrogatory
show
that
they
knew
it
back
in
october
of
1973,
two
months
before
they
levied
the
jeopardy
assessment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
because
i
think
that
the
government
that
he
would
have
no
possible
way
of
defending
himself
against
what
i
believe
would
have
been
insubstantial
allegations
or
what
he
believed
to
be
insubstantial
allegations
of
criminality.
if
the
government
proceeds
against
someone
before
he
is
about
to
be
extradited
and
seizes
his
assets
and
indeed
the
inference
is
here
are
that
the
government
procedure
in
a
way
in
which
it
supposed
that
he
might
not
even
learn
about
it
until
after
he
was
out
of
the
country.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
the
bottom
wrong,
the
fact
out
of
which
the
alleged
tax
liability
arose
was
alleged
criminal
act?
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
what
the
court
of
appeals…
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
did
not
mean
to
do
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
did
is
it
gave
us
a
day
in
court
and
i
think
that
the
only
things
that
i
am
trying
to
do
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
what
i
want
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
i
am
trying
to
do
here.
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
i
think
we
have
a
statutory
argument
and
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
we
have
a
constitutional
argument
as
well.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
what
your
honor
is
referring
to
is
that
if
the
internal
revenue
service
acted
on
the
basis
of
what
might
be
arbitrary
and
excessive
procedures,
then
we
are
entitled
to
proceed
in
the
district
court
under
the
procedures
that
lucia
and
pizzarello
set
out,
then
i
would
like
to
proceed
directly
to
that
point.
those
are
two
cases
which
the
court
of
appeals
applied.
one
of
which
was
decided,
i
might
say,
by
unanimous
en
banc
fifth
circuit,
that
is
14
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit,
there
was
a
separate
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
which
in
fact
we
have
got
further
than
the
majority
opinion
with
lucia.
and,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
lucia
was
that
if
the
government’s
jeopardy
assessment
is
alleged
to
be
arbitrary
and
excessive,
then
the
government
must
at
least
come
forward
with
something
other
than
then
mere
protestations
of
good
faith
and
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
in
lucia
that
it
was
not
sufficient
if
the
government
simply
said,
“well,
we
made
a
projection
out
of
this
man’s
wagering
proceeds
that
he
could
have
made
so
and
so
much
money
over
the
course
of
the
year.
we
think
our
case,
and
the
same
thing
was
true
in
pizzarello,
both
of
which
involved
admitted
gamblers
whose
assets
or
who
was
the
subject
of
a
seizure
as
to
which
the
proceeds
of
their
gambling
for
a
definite
period
of
time
was
known
for
one
day
or
for
three
days
and
the
government
made
a
projection
from
that.
in
this
case,
we
think
it
follows
a
fortiori
from
lucia
and
pizzarello
because
in
this
case,
mr.
shapiro
denied
under
oath
that
he
had
ever
been
engaged
in
the
illegal
activity.
one
does
not
even
reach
the
question
of
projection.
in
fact,
if
one
looks
at
what
the
government
relied
in
the
later
hearing
before
the
district
court,
they
did
rely
on
a
projection
precisely
like
that
that
was
involved
in
lucia
and
pizzarello
and
which
the
courts
of
appeals
in
those
cases
held
would
be
inadequate.
in
this
case,
the
government
is
asking
a
projection
to
be
applied
to
the
kind
of
conduct
which
i
would
think
this
court
could
almost
take
judicial
notice
would
not
be
as
regular
and
repeated
as
it
would
be
in
the
case
of
one
who
is
writing
a
book
making
establishment
who
has
regular
daily
customers.
at
most,
what
the
affidavit
which
appears
in
our
brief
and
which
was
filed
by
the
government
in
that
hearing
shows
was
that
on
several
isolated
occasions,
they
believed
that
the
money
that
mr.
shapiro
received
were
proceeds
of
hashish
sales.
so,
we
have
here
the
denial
of
the
illegal
activity,
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
projection.
we
submit
that
both
those
things
together
certainly
warranted
the
court
of
appeals
and
saying
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
day
in
court
in
which
what
the
government
used
as
a
basis
for
its
claim
would
come
forward
in
court,
what
our
client
said
in
response
to
that
would
come
forward
in
the
court
and
the
court
would
then
make
a
finding.
it
is
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
left
vague
what
the
contours
of
that
finding
would
be
and
the
judge
has
given
--
the
trial
judge
has
given
substantial
discretion
to
proceed
under
such
standards
as
he
might
think
appropriate
to
this
particular
case.
but
we
do
not
think
that
that
on
anyway
undermines
the
bottom
line
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
which
is
really
that,
a
complaint
of
this
kind
which
alleges
procedural
deficiencies,
alleges
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government,
raising
constitutional
questions
and
alleges
that
the
basis
for
the
jeopardy
assessment
which
is
arbitrary,
excessive
and
beyond
the
constitutional
power,
therefore,
the
internal
revenue
service
warrants
a
full
hearing
in
the
district
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
certainly,
on
behalf
of
the
respondent,
i
would
consent
if
the
government
consents
to
the
court
considering
what
happened
in
the
district
court
subsequent
to
that
time,
simply
because
from
our
client’s
point
of
view,
we
think
it
is
important
to
get
them
out
of
resolve.
now,
we
think
that
the
entire
record
that
is
before
the
district
court
should
be
before
this
court.
i
know
the
transcript
is
here.
i
must
submit,
i
am
not
sure
whether
those
two
affidavits
have
been
filed,
but
i
will
check
that
with
the
clerk
and
file
them.
but,
if
the
government
has
filed
and
lodged
that
these
are
the
documents
and
we
both
discussed
them
on
the
briefs,
we
certainly
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
what
happened
subsequent
to
that
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and,
mr.
justice
white,
if
we
had
filed
in
response
to
that
what
we
filed
in
the
district
court
in
response
to
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
and
i
should
point
out
in
that
regard
that
what
the
district
said
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
is
that
there
should
be
discovery
so
that
our
view
is
that
there
should
be
further
proceedings.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
am
sorry
in
that
regard.
but
in
other
words,
the
district
court
has
said,
the
district
court
has
now
said
that
there
will
be
further
proceedings
and
it
has
ordered
us
to
proceed
with
discovery.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
the
court
would
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
but,
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
except
that
there
has
been
no
subsequent
appealable
order,
i
suppose.
the
court
of
appeals
might
consider
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
considering
without
an
appealable
order.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
suppose
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
our
feeling
is
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
as
it
appears,
there
is
reason
for
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
and
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment
remanding
it
was
correct
that
there
should
be
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
right.
that
is
our
position.
it
supports
the
correctness
of
that
conclusion.
