justice
byron

white
where
would
this
showing
be
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
district
court,
so
you
do
not
--
you
say
that
it
is
proper
to
file
this
suit
and
it
is
just
in
face
of
the
anti-injunction
act
and
that
one
or
the
other,
the
party
is
going
to
show
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
he
had
his
company
locked
up
and
he
cannot
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that
you
would
assume
it
because
(inaudible)
and
he
would
go
forward
in
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
ought
to
show
something
if
you
are
going
to
hold
this
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
but
you
say
that
the
–
you
are
mostly
dismissed
and
said,
“dismiss
this
case
because
in
fact
the
taxpayer
has
given
his
burden.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
fact
that
if
there
be
any
burden
at
all,
it
would
be
--
if
he
only
knows
as
if
you
have
seized
his
property
and
he
says,
“i
do
not
know
any
tax
and
i
have
no
idea
why
the
government
thinks
i
owe
some
tax.”
now,
maybe
if
the
government
comes
in
and
says
so
or
says
something,
maybe
then
he
has
some
burden
i
do
not
know
of.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
were
not
required
in
order
to
get
relief
to
file
what
you
filed
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
your
position
of
sitting
on
it
until
the
tax
court
acts
and
you
say
you
do
not
have
to
prove
anything
until
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
originally,
the
district
court
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
fortiori
if
you
had
filed
something
more
than
just
your
motion.
it
would
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
have
decided
in
your
favor
on
this
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
has
to
do
is
something
a
way
beyond
the
court
of
appeals
and
these
things
that
were
not
resolved
there
and
are
not
before
us
now
as
far
as
i
can
see?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
that
is
what
you
want
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
want
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
it
because
you
have
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
it
because
you
have
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
the
argument
is
forced
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lewin,
mr.
powell
and
maybe
others
have
asked
your
predecessor
just
what
we
have
here
to
review
in
this
case.
do
we
--
we
granted
certiorari
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
remanding
to
the
district
court
and
should
we
assume
that
that
is
all
we
have
and
all
we
know
and
wholly
disregard
what
has
subsequently
taken
place
in
the
district
court
or
do
we
have
something
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
agreeable
to
approach
the
case
by
asking
if
the
government
had
filed
immediately
in
answer
to
the
complaint
what
it
has
now
filed
in
the
district
court,
whether
or
not
then
it
would
be
justified
in
holding
your
client’s
property
pending
the
complete
hearing
the
tax
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
take
it
that
your
answer
to
me,
that
if
we
look
at
the
record
and
if
we
were
willing
to
undertake
it
and
we
would
say,
“well,
the
government
has
filed
all
that
it
would
ever
need
to
file
to
satisfy
any
kind
of
the
enochs’
burden,
therefore,
if
we
decided
that,
we
would
say
that
the
district
court
was
right
in
dismissing
the
case.
that
is
what
your
answer
means
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
i
know
we
may
not
come
to
that
conclusion,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
say
we
ought
to
--
arguably
if
you
--
we
should
never
undertake
then
arguably
we
really
should
say
that
we
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
this
judgment
on
the
basis
of
what
is
happened
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
be
as
much
there
as
it
is
here?[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
concerns
what
showing
a
tax
payer
must
make
to
escape
the
bar,
the
anti-injunction
act
and
recover
his
property
which
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
seized
pursuant
to
a
jeopardy
assessment,
pending
for
hearing
in
the
tax
court.
the
district
court
in
this
case
dismissed
the
tax
payers
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
ordering
for
the
proceedings
of
the
district
court.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
are
unresolved
questions
that
the
district
court
should
address
and
the
hence
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
filed
an
opinion
which
states
our
reasons
at
a
much
greater
length.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
has
been
joined
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
