mr.
baum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
presents
once
again
the
problem
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
in
its
preceding
two
terms
namely,
injunctions
against
the
assessment
and
collection
of
taxes
and
the
prohibition
against
such
injunctions
which
is
contained
in
section
7421
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
court
dealt
with
it
two
years
ago
in
bob
jones
university
and
americans
united.
it
dealt
with
it
several
years
earlier
in
williams
packing,
and
briefly
again
last
term
in
american
friends
service
committee.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
very
same
day
on
which
this
court
announced
its
opinions
in
bob
jones
university
and
americans
united,
reversed
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
dismissing
this
complaint
for
injunction
and
held
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
a
hearing
at
which
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
would
be
required
to
make
a
factual
submission
as
to
the
basis
for
the
tax
assessment
here
involved
and
in
which
the
respondent
taxpayer
would
be
permitted
discovery.
the
commission
has
sought
rehearing
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
opinions
in
bob
jones
university
and
americans
united,
but
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
modify
its
decision
and
accordingly,
we
sought
and
obtained
certiorari.
the
controversy
arises
in
the
following
circumstances.
mr.
shapiro
is
a
citizen
of
israel
who
came
to
the
united
states
in
1970.
at
some
time
in
that
year
or
shortly
thereafter,
he
was
indicted
in
israel
for
security
fraud
and
the
government
of
israel
requested
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
permit
his
extradition.
the
question
of
his
extradition
was
litigated
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
both
courts
held
that
mr.
shapiro
was
extraditable
and
ordered
his
surrender.
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
with
this
court.
while
that
petition
was
pending,
mr.
shapiro
negotiated
an
agreement
with
the
state
of
israel
under
which
he
would
withdraw
his
petition
and
would
surrender
for
extradition,
if
the
state
of
israel
would
allow
him
to
remain
here
until
his
then
unborn
child
was
born
and
we
would
allow
him
to
remain
on
bail
until
his
trial
in
israel.
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
from
that
extradition
was
then
withdrawn
and
mr.
shapiro
was
scheduled
to
surrender
for
extradition
on
december
9th
1973.
on
december
6
of
that
year,
three
days
earlier,
the
commissioner,
upon
learning
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
that
this
extradition
was
to
take
place,
and
pursuing
an
investigation
which
had
begun
in
september
’73,
issued
a
jeopardy
assessment
against
mr.
shapiro
for
income
taxes
amounting
to
approximately
$7,000.00
for
the
year
1970
and
$85,000.00
for
the
year
1971
and
levied
on
some
bank
accounts
maintained
by
mr.
shapiro
which
represented
some,
but
not
all
of
his
property.
this
of
course
was
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
had
mr.
shapiro
been
allowed
to
depart,
the
bank
accounts
would
have
also
departed
and
there
would
have
been
no
funds
available
to
the
united
states
to
collect
taxes
which
it
believed
to
be
due.
at
this
point,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
point
out
the
procedure
for
these
assessments.
normally,
in
income
tax
cases,
the
commissioner,
if
he
determines
a
deficiency
is
due
from
a
taxpayer,
must
under
the
code
issue
a
statutory
notice
of
deficiency,
which
provides
that
within
90
days
thereafter,
the
tax
payer
may
file
a
petition
for
review
in
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states.
this
is
the
procedure
described
in
section
6212
and
6213
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
appear
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
if
he
does
not
follow
that
procedure,
that
statute
expressly
provides
that
he
may
be
enjoined.
but,
section
6213
contains
an
express
exception,
namely
for
a
jeopardy
assessment
under
section
6861.
that
section
provides
that
if
the
commissioner
believes
that
the
assessment
or
collection
of
a
deficiency
may
be
in
jeopardy,
he
shall,
not
withstanding
the
provisions
of
section
6213,
immediately
assess
such
deficiency.
if
he
does
this
before
a
notice
of
deficiency
has
been
issued,
the
statute
further
provides
that
he
must
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
within
60
days
of
that
assessment.
thus,
in
jeopardy
assessments,
the
procedure
is
essentially
reversed.
the
assessment
comes
first
and
the
notice
of
deficiency
comes
second.
mr.
baum
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
baum
he
is
in
israel
now,
your
honor.
mr.
baum
he
has
not
been
tried
as
far
as
we
are
aware.
mr.
baum
he
is
free
on
bond.
this
was
represented
in
a
district
court
by
counsel
for
mr.
shapiro.
section
6861
also
provides
that
notice
and
demand
for
payment
shall
be
made
by
the
commissioner
in
a
case
of
a
jeopardy
assessment,
without
waiting
the
ten
days
which
we
have
found
to
exist
in
other
statutes.
the
taxpayer
has
raised
a
point
in
brief
and
he
raised
it
below
that
mr.
shapiro
never
did
receive
notice.
this
is
contradicted,
however,
by
an
affidavit
of
the
revenue
service
center
official
who
is
responsible
for
the
mailing
of
the
notice
and
a
copy
of
that
affidavit
is
printed
at
pages
and
10a
and
11a
of
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
baum
after
the
decision
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
baum
i
would
like
to
say
in
response
to
that,
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
proceedings
in
a
district
court
were
dismissed
before
any
question
was
raised
about
the
non-receipt
of
the
notice.
the
non-receipt
of
notice
came
in
the
subsequent
proceedings
and
it
has
placed
an
issue
by
counsel
before
the
court
now.
mr.
baum
part
of
my
best
recollection
is,
your
honor.
mr.
baum
if
that
were
all
to
be
litigated,
we
would
not
be
here,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
baum
we
think
we
have
established
it.
mr.
baum
yes,
your
honor.
but,
under
the
internal
revenue
code
however
--
mr.
baum
there
are
numerous
decisions,
mr.
justice
marshall,
which
hold
that
in
a
case
of
internal
revenue
notices,
there
is
no
statutory
requirement
that
they
would
be
received.
it
is
efficient
if
there
is
proof
that
they
have
been
sent.
this
has
happened
in
a
number
of
times
in
a
tax
court
because
of
the
statutory
notices
and
we
submit
that
we
have
established
in
a
usual
fashion
and
under
the
fashion
required
by
the
federal
rules
that
it
was
mailed
in
due
course.
indeed,
a
copy
of
the
notice
appears
in
the
taxpayer’s
brief
at
the
following
pages,
12a
and
13a.
and
the
taxpayer
however
says,
“the
form
says,
taxpayer’s
copy.”
it
says
taxpayer’s
copy
because
he
has
failed
to
take
into
account
the
computerization
of
the
revenue
service,
the
revenue
service
file
copy
is
a
piece
of
magnetic
tape,
and
the
only
way
the
service
can
reproduce
a
document
is
to
push
the
appropriate
button
if
that
would
be
the
device
on
the
machine
and
it
will
print
out
on
the
form
which
has
printed
on
a
taxpayer’s
copy
because
they
do
not
make
copies
for
themselves,
they
have
the
permanent
magnetic
tape.
in
accordance
with
the
prescribed
procedure,
the
commissioner
issued
a
statutory
notice
of
deficiency
to
this
taxpayer
within
15
days,
not
60,
but
within
15
days
on
december
21,
1973.
and
shortly
thereafter,
on
january
3,
1974,
mr.
shapiro
filed
his
petition
in
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states.
that
petition
is
still
pending
and
is
awaiting
trial
and
that
is
a
factor
which
distinguishes
this
case
from
your
prior
decisions
where
there
was
no
tax
court
petition
pending.
in
a
meantime
however,
he
filed
this
action
for
an
injunction
on
december
13th
in
a
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
seeking
to
have
the
levies
removed
and
also
seeking
to
have
his
extraditions
stayed.
the
latter
part
has
been
disposed
off
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
no
longer
before
this
court,
that
is
the
extradition
and
it
was
after
that
that
he
departed
and
returned
to
israel.
after
hearings
before
the
district
court
in
december
1973
and
after
a
copy
of
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
filed
with
court,
it
dismissed
the
action
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
on
the
authority
of
your
decision
in
williams
packing
company.
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
that
dismissal
was
incorrect
because
the
court
should
have
held
a
hearing
at
which
the
commissioner
would
be
required
to
come
forward
with
a
factual
submission
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
the
assessment.
it
also
held
--
mr.
baum
i
think
your
honor
has
asked
me
two
questions
and
i
would
like
to
answer
them.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
indicate
exactly
what
procedure.
in
fact,
in
conclusion
of
its
opinion
appearing
on
16a
of
our
petition
for
certiorari,
it
says
that
the
district
court
is
not
required
to
explore
the
matter
and
precisely
the
same
manner
as
in
lucia
and
pizzarello,
each
case
is
different
and
should
be
considered
on
its
particular
facts,
which
frankly
i
must
admit,
leaves
us
very
little
guidance.
on
the
second
point,
it
is
exactly
what
happened
in
a
district
court
while
we
were
considering
and
filing
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
proceeding
that
illuminates
it
because
the
district
court
has
imposed
a
much
more
onerous
burden
on
us
than
possibly
even
the
court
of
appeals
contemplated,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
baum
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
baum
you
could
call
it
that,
your
honor,
yes.
but,
i
do
not
know
what
a
probably
cause
hearing
is
in
a
tax
context.
mr.
baum
and
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
if
your
honor
please,
require
that
the
taxpayer,
the
plaintiff
must
establish
by
some
means
that
there
has
been
some
taint
of
illegality
in
this
assessment.
instead,
the
whole
burden
has
been
placed
upon
the
government
to
justify
its
action
by
the
mere
filing
of
an
injunction
complaint.
mr.
baum
not
at
all,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
taxpayer
had
met
the
other
test
of
williams
packing
namely
the
equity
of
jurisdiction
test.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
error
on
both
counts.
this
court
said
in
williams
packing
and
in
bob
jones
university
that
injunctions
restraining
the
assessment
and
collections
of
taxes
might
not
issue
unless
the
taxpayer
can
prove
that
it
is
clear
that
under
no
circumstances
would
the
government
prevail.
in
my
humble
opinion,
that
goes
way
beyond
a
probable
cause
requirement.
it
also
of
course
reiterated
the
necessity
for
requirement
of
equity
jurisdiction.
and,
this
is
nothing,
but
a
recognition
as
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
danger
of
a
wave
of
injunction
suits
flooding
the
courts
and
delaying
the
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
baum
he
says
that,
your
honor,
but
the
notice
of
deficiency
which
was
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
states
that
for
the
year
1970,
he
had
$18,000.00
in
unexplained
bank
deposits.
under
numerous
decisions
of
which
one
might
be
o’dwyer
versus
commissioner,
that
is
sufficient
to
carry
the
commissioner’s
burden
of
showing
that
there
may
be
a
tax
liability
and
that
the
burden
is
then
on
the
taxpayer
to
show
that
those,
that
$18,000.00
in
this
case,
does
not
represent
taxable
income.
as
to
year
1971,
the
notice
of
deficiency
stated
expressly
that
he
had
$137,000.00
from
narcotics
transactions
in
taxable
income
and
a
tax
was
imposed
accordingly
for
the
year
1971.
now,
i
submit
that
is
a
–
certainly,
he
was
not
completely
uninformed
as
to
the
basis
for
the
commissioner’s
action.
indeed,
he
was
put
on
ample
notice
of
the
basis
for
it.
in
fact,
the
commissioner
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
says
that
the
district
court
should
obtain
some
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
tax
was
arbitrary
or
excessive.
in
other
words,
the
commissioner
is
the
one
who
is
on
trial,
and
all
we
had
before
the
district
court
was
an
affidavit,
accompanying
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
which
says,
“i
had
no
taxable
income
for
1970
and
my
1971
tax
return
was
correct.”
that
is
far
from
showing
that
the
commissioner
acted
wholly,
irrationally,
arbitrarily
or
in
any
capricious
manner.
the
court
does
not
only
ignore
that
the
fact
–
or
the
two-fold
test
at
williams
packing
company
and
the
fact
a
simple
denial
is
not
sufficient
to
carry
the
burden
would
have
posed
on
a
taxpayer.
but,
it
assumed
that
there
was
a
lack
of
good
faith.
for
lack
of
good
faith
and
the
necessity
for
speed
here
which
gave
rise
to
the
accusation
of
lack
of
good
faith
was
of
course
as
i
said
earlier,
the
question
of
imminent
departure.
and,
nothing
in
any
decision
of
this
court
supports
the
view
that
there
should
be
a
heavier
burden
on
a
tax
--
on
the
commission
when
the
taxpayer
brings
an
injunction
suit,
then
there
should
be
--
if
he
bought
a
refund
suit
or
filed
a
petition
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
baum
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
as
to
that
branch
of
the
case.
of
course,
that
would
not
affect
the
narcotics
transactions.
mr.
baum
no
it
would
not
your
honor.
what
is
most
serious
to
us
about
this
case
(voice
overlap)
mr.
baum
if
what
i
think
allow
the
court
some
basis
for
coming
in
and
saying,
“now
mr.
commissioner,
it
is
incumbent
upon
you
to
examine
the
--
to
acquaintance
us
with
the
facts
underlying
this
case.”
mr.
baum
that
is
correct.
mr.
baum
in
the
district
court.
mr.
baum
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
baum
i
doubt
that
it
would,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
some
of
the
government’s
evidence
was
based
upon
confidential
informants
that
would
not
have
been
(voice
overlap)
mr.
baum
well,
i
submit
that
is
what
we
did
when
we
filed
a
notice
of
deficiency
on
the
21st
of
december
1973.
mr.
baum
well,
i
do
not
think
that
changes
it,
your
honor.
it
had
before
on
motion
to
dismiss
other
materials
even
though
that
was
the
procedural
framework
in
which
the
issue
arose.
because
essentially,
if
your
honor
please
what
the
court
has
done,
is
not
only
inverted
the
burden
of
proof,
but
it
has
changed
the
forum
for
the
resolution
of
tax
disputes.
if
this
decision
stands,
any
taxpayer
can
ignore
his
right
to
go
to
the
tax
court,
can
ignore
the
proper
possibly
of
refund
suits
and
file
an
action
for
an
injunction
with
a
general
denial
that
he
owes
any
money.
and,
he
is
then
in
the
position
of
letting
the
commissioner
come
forward
and
produce
the
evidence
which
stays
the
assessment
having
the
court
decide
whether
that
evidence
is
sufficient
and
possibly
deciding
the
whole
merits
of
the
controversy
in
advance.
mr.
baum
that
is
correct.
mr.
baum
he
cannot
get
it.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
baum
but
if
your
honor
please,
this
has
been
in
existence
since
1924
and
we
have
been
using
this
statute
in
a
direct
statutory
purpose
as
contained
in
the
statute
is
to
shorten
the
time
and,
that
is
why
the
60-day
period
for
giving
a
statutory
notice
of
deficiency,
allowing
him
to
go
to
the
tack,
but
we
may
not
sell
the
property,
we
can
only
hold
it
and
having
accelerated
the
whole
statutory
scheme,
that
is
what
the
congress
and
which
has
been
upheld
many,
many
times.
there
is
no
problem
on
that
and
if
he
had
made
some
showing,
some
substantial
showing
that
there
was
a
wholly
arbitrary
tax
here
or
something
just
based
upon
retribution
as
might
be
his
claim,
then
i
would
understand
the
point.
but,
i
see
nothing
when
a
straight
forward
tax
assessment
is
made
based
upon
alleged
items
of
income
and
where
you
are
immediately
at
issue
as
to
whether
those
items
of
income
are
true,
incorrect
or
not
as
we
are
in
thousands
of
tax
cases
every
year.
mr.
baum
that
is
correct.
mr.
baum
but
then
in
every
jeopardy
case,
your
honor,
we
would
have
been
accused
of
seizing
a
man’s
property
and
proceeding
without
any
basis
for
him
to
challenge
and
he
would
then
get
an
immediate
trial
--
mr.
baum
well,
i
think
what
happened
here
discloses
it.
that
is
not
quite
true,
your
honor.
we
filed
an
affidavit
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
says,
“that
is
wholly
insufficient.
we
want
you
to
bring
in
your
confidential
informants.”
mr.
baum
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
baum
well,
that
as
i
submit
what
we
did,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
baum
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
which
was
in
accordance
with
this
court’s
holdings
and
the
rules
provide
that
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
court
may
consider
affidavits
in
and
other
materials
in
deciding
the
motion.
mr.
baum
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
baum
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
baum
that
is
a
very
anomalous
situation,
your
honor.
we
have
lodged
with
this
court
the
proceedings
subsequent
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
we
are
in
the
position
of
the
district
court
refusing
to
await
our
filing
of
a
petition
for
search
--
for
written
certiorari.
the
district
court
ordered
us
to
proceed
and
we
had
to
do
something
and
we
would
not
willing
to
be
in
contempt
to
the
district
court.
so,
we
are
in
a
position
of
having
been
proceeding
in
two
courts
at
once.
i
have
never
had
that
experience
before.
mr.
baum
it
could,
your
honor,
because
we
submit
that
there
is
no
longer
any
showing
of
irreparable
(voice
overlap)
mr.
baum
well,
of
course,
we
would
prefer
that
you
look
at
what
you
granted
certiorari
to
consider
because
we
think
that
it
is
a
misapplication
of
your
honor's
opinion
of
two
years
ago.
mr.
baum
that
is
correct.
the
affidavit
on
the
subsequent
proceedings,
that
is
correct.
we
were
compelled
to
do
that.
we
think
that
went
far
beyond
the
requirements
of
any
of
the
cases.
in
williams
packing,
as
this
court
knows,
the
taxpayer
came
in
and
said,
“i
do
not
owe
the
tax”
and
this
court
said,
“we
are
sorry,
that
does
not
get
you
an
injunction,
pursue
your
remedies
and
we
do
not
have
the
problem
here.”
the
trouble
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
americans
united
of
no
problem
of
a
tax
liability.
we
have
a
real
tax
liability
which
is
before
the
tax
court
and
the
tax
court
is
in
a
position
to
decide
it
as
it
does
everyday
and
this
court
would
then
be
in
a
position
to
review
it
if
it
so
desired
at
a
later
date.
but,
we
are
not
in
a
position
of
sitting
on
the
man’s
property
for
an
indefinite
period
and
keeping
it.
mr.
baum
until
the
taxpayer
has
come
forward
with
some
showing
that
this
assessment
is
made
out
of
whole
cloth.
that
is,
i
submit,
what
the
burden
is
in
this
case
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
taxpayer
by
any
remote
stretch
of
the
imagination,
by
a
mere
general
denial
that
he
owes
any
tax
has
made
that
showing.
mr.
baum
i
doubt
that,
your
honor,
because
the
district
judge
said
the
affidavit
was
wholly
insufficient.
of
course,
he
had
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
mr.
baum
the
district
court
originally
dismissed
in
(voice
overlap)
of
williams
packing,
yes
your
honor
he
did
and
--
mr.
baum
well,
he
did
not
think
it
made
any
difference
at
that
point
and
his
mind
has
been
changed,
at
least
for
the
time
being.
mr.
baum
well,
i
hardly
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
government
is
forcing
him
out
of
the
country.
it
is
his
home
government
that
was
requesting
his
presence
for
an
urgent
appointment
with
a
criminal
court
there.
mr.
baum
lastly
if
i
may,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
rely
on
two
decisions
namely
pizzarello
and
lucia,
pizzarello
in
the
second
circuit
and
lucia
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
both
of
those,
i
think
illustrate
the
point
that
possibly
you
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
white
were
making.
these
are
the
extremes.
in
pizzarello,
on
the
basis
of
three
day's
transactions,
we
projected
a
wagering
tax
for
a
five-year
period
in
a
face
of
an
indictment
for
two
months.
in
lucia,
we
did
it
for
over
four
years
on
a
basis
of
a
one
day's
transaction.
i
might
add
in
pizzarello
that
there
was
the
additional
factor
that
the
evidence
was
obtained
by
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
thank
you,
your
honor.
