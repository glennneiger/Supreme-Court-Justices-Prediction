justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
what
stage
of
the
proceeding
was
that
affidavit
filed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
--
one
thing
that
kind
of
raises
some
problems
for
me
about
the
case
is
that,
are
we
entitled
to
consider
in
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
proceedings
that
transpired
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
both
the
contention
and
the
response
occurred
in
the
post
court
of
appeals
hearing
in
the
district
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
mr.
baum
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
any
precise
civil
procedure
type
of
thing
in
mind?
would
it
have
been
enough
if
the
government
had
filed
an
answer
to
the
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
are
in
the
context
with
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
here
i
take
it.
an
action
was
filed
seeking
injunctive
relief
and
that
would
be
governed
whether
or
not
by
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
rules
of
simple
procedure
do
not
necessarily
supplant
whatever
may
have
been
said
in
enochs.
conceivably,
enochs
may
mean
that
the
government
has
to
file
an
answer
in
a
case
like
that,
but
do
you
know
of
any
provision
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
talks
about
a
probable
cause
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
not
mr.
shapiroâ€™s
contention
here
that
all
of
a
sudden
this
just
came
like
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
and
if
the
government
did
not
tell
him
why
they
were
after
him,
he
had
no
way
of
evaluating
their
claim
or
arguing
that
it
was
baseless?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
some
of
the
problem
that
is
followed
here
have
been
saved
if
the
government
simply
filed
an
answer
to
the
complaint
for
an
injunction
outlining
in
very
tough
form
the
basis
for
the
imposition
of
the
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
the
pleadings
we
have
now
you
do
not
answer
in
great
detail
as
to
what
witnesses
will
testify.
do
you
just
answer
the
same
way
that
you
allege
in
a
complaint?
you
can
be
fairly
a
cursive
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
but
procedurally,
in
a
district
court,
instead
of
answering,
you
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
indeed,
you
can
enforce
the
commissioner
to
come
forward
by
discovery
under
the
court
of
appeals
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
long
before
he
could
on
the
tax
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
says
in
effect
that
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
claim.
if
you
had
answered
the
test
might
well
be
that
unless
the
claimant
can
obtain
the
judgment
for
motion
of
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
the
thing
should
be
dismissed,
but
you
did
not
even
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rather
than
pursuing
a
kind
of
13,
a
dinner
(ph)
thing,
we
really
have
to
review
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
do
we
not?
there
may
be
issues
that
it
did
not
reach,
but
i
would
think
that
we
would
not
reach
them
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewin,
did
you
raise
any
constitutional
issue
like
this
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
in
good
faith.
you
mean
that
the
government,
if
all
the
facts
were
brought
out
really
did
not
even
have
a
colorable
claim
of
tax
liability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
no
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
does
not
really
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
government
had
at
least
a
colorable
claim
of
tax
liability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it
had
a
colorable
claim
for
revenue,
that
is
the
end
of
the
question,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
then
if
they
levied
against
the
al
capone,
for
income
tax
violation,
actually
he
was
guilty
of
an
awful
lot
of
other
things
worst
than
income
tax
violation,
al
could
have
come
in
and
got
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that
if
there
is
criminal
liability,
the
government
must
prosecute
a
criminally
even
though
if
there
is
a
tax
liability
conjointly,
it
cannot
pursue
the
tax
liability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
vary
what
i
take
you
concede
to
be
the
general
rule
that
the
government
can
proceed
both
criminally
and
to
collect
taxes
at
the
same
time,
the
fact
that
he
is
just
about
to
be
extradited?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
charge
--
the
basis
of
the
assessment
was
tax
liability,
not
criminality?
