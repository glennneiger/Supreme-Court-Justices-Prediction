bring
me
up
to
date
on
the
facts
about
mr.
shapiro.
is
he
back
in
his
country?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
he
been
tried
over
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
he
free
on
bond
over
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
baum
about
(voice

that
paragraph
5
it
does
not
--
may
i
properly
draw
the
influence
from
this
that
they
are
talking
about
a
probable
cause
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
probable
cause
hearing.
the
commissioner
has
to
come
up
with
some
showing
from
which
an
inference
of
probable
cause
to
levy
the
tax,
maybe
inferred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
all
to
the
end
argument,
we
ought
to
look
at
all
this
i
gather
is
your
submission,
only
to
see
whether
the
remand
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
should
be
sustained
or
reversed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suggest,
i
think
you
answer
to
justice
whiteâ€™s
(inaudible)
inconsistent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
everything
has
happened
since
you
say
only
supports
that
conclusion
of
court
of
appeals
