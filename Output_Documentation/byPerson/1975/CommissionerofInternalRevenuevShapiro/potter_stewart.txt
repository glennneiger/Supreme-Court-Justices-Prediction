by
the
time
he
filed
his
complaint
in
the
district
court
and
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
all
he
knew
was
that
he
was
scheduled
to
be
deported
or
rather
extradited
in
a
very
short
time
and
that
the
united
states
government
had
seized
all
of
his
assets
in
the
united
states
and
he
knew
nothing
else,
is
that
not
right?
that
is
what
his
complaint
said.
justice

stewart
so,
it
would
then
be
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
file
something
as
a
pleading
in
that
court
to
allow
the
district
court
to
apply
the
very
test
that
this
court
has
established
in
the
enochs
case.
otherwise,
the
court
would
find
it
absolutely
impossible
to
do
what
this
court
has
told
it
has
to
do
it,
that
is
to
apply
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
it
would
be
incumbent
on
you
to
file
a
pleading
in
a
court,
which
is
--
well,
that
is
what
is
incumbent
upon
any
defendant
in
any
court
anywhere
when
he
is
sued.
there
is
no
discrimination
against
you
at
all.
