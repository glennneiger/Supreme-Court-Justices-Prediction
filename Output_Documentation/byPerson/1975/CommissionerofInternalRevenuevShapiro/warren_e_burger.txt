mr.
baum,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
instead
of
responding
as
he
did
in
the
conclusion
terms,
he
had
submitted
a
certified
copy
of
a
final
decree
of
his
grandmother’s
estate
showing
that
at
the
time
of
these
deposits
inherited
precisely
or
substantially
that
amount,
would
you
say
that
would
have
carried
the
taxpayer’s
burden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
would
not
affect
--
it
would
not
with
finality
determine
all
of
the
tax
aspects
either,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
burden
would
it
have
on
the
jeopardy
assessment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
the
condition
to
the
continued
impoundment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
right
now,
i
have
been
waiting
to
get
your
reaction
to
it,
somewhat
to
point
that
justice
powell
was
pursuing.
i
read
the
last
paragraph
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
17a
of
the
cert
petition
as
indicating
that
the
irreparable
injury
which
seems
to
be
the
fulcrum
was
that
if
he
did
not
get
this
money,
he
would
not
be
able
to
put
a
bond
when
he
was
extradited
to
israel
and
that
it
was
the
incarceration.
shapiro,
the
opinions
says
that
after
extradition,
shapiro
will
be
incarcerated,
an
incarceration
that
will
cause
irreparable
injury
for
which
he
has
no
remedy
at
law
and
so,
the
court
of
appeals
then
decided.
now,
that
was
a
premise
that
had
some
flaws
in
it,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
fulcrum
of
this
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
evidence
is
there
in
this
record
that
these
constitute
his
entire
assets
since
he
has
now
apparently
been
able
to
make
bail
in
israel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
does
not
remove
it
automatically
from
the
category
of
taxable
income,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
she
say
how
long
she
held
it
and
what
she
was
holding
it
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
those
are
the
kind
of
issues
you
try
out
in
the
law
suit
on
tax
liability
and
not
the
way
you
are
trying
them
out
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
general
credit?
what
if
he
had
a
general
creditor
of
the
same
amounts
that
are
involved
here
who
use
the
typical
attachment
processes
that
apply
to
a
departing
debtor,
would
your
situation
be
much
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said,
the
government
excluding
him
from
the
country,
at
the
same
time
they
are
seizing
all
of
his
assets,
was
the
united
states
excluding
him
from
the
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
israel
plucking
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
united
states
was
fulfilling
a
treaty
obligation,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
he
won
all
this
money
at
the
races
instead
of
that
criminal
conduct,
it
still
would
be
a
subject
to
tax,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
mr.
shapiro
file
any
affidavit
that
corresponds
to
and
dovetails
the
affidavit
of
the
lady
in
switzerland
who
said
that
she
held
his
cash
for
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
own
affidavit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
in
the
record
before
us
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it
is
not
even
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice
warren
e.

and
opinions
