justice

f.
powell,

mr.
baum.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
do
not
think
you
filed
a
definitive
affidavit
until
after
the
decision
(voice
overlap)
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
prompts
me
to
ask
a
question
i
think
was
alluded
to
by
one
of
the
other
justices
earlier,
what
is
before
us?
we
granted
certiorari
from
the
decision
and
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
your
brief
and
i
think
the
brief
of
the
opponent
tell
us
about
what
happened
subsequently
and
you
have
been
speaking
a
good
deal
of
what
happens
subsequently.
is
anything
before
us
beyond
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this?
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
judgment
on
the
two
tests
laid
down
in
enochs.
one
of
them
was
irreparable
injury
because
the
taxpayer
was
not
able
to
obtain
bond
and
would
be
imprisoned
in
israel.
the
district
court
proceeding
that
followed
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
revealed
that
the
taxpayer
is
out
on
bail.
so
now,
there
is
no
irreparable
injury.
does
that
dispose
the
case
under
the
enochs?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
good
under
enochs
and
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
brings
me
back
to
my
question.
what
do
we
look
at
with
what
you
say
on
your
briefs
or
we
grant
a
certiorari
to
consider?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
had
filed
the
affidavit
initially,
that
was
ultimately
filed
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
you
probably
would
not
be
here
today,
would
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
it
is
in
light
of
that
decision
i
would
assume?
