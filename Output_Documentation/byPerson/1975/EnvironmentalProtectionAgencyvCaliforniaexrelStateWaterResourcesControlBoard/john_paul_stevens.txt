mr.
gorton,
may
i
go
back
to
my
prior
point
just
where
you
are
now.
it
would
not
however
free
the
federal
agency
from
the
requirement
of
complying
with
the
applicable
effluent
limitation
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
reproduced
anything
than
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
what,
of
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
the
california
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
requested,
what
is
the
word
requirement
mean
in
313?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
i
see,
you
are
saying,
you
argue
requirement
means
substantive
limitation
in
313
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
means
the
same
thing
in
506?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
your
response
to
the
402
(c)
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
more
basic
402
argument
that
state
and
federal
permits
under
the
statute
standard
fall
together.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
like
hear
why.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
great
big
part
of
their
argument
is
so
far
as
i
have
heard
you
have
not
redirected
the
authority.
