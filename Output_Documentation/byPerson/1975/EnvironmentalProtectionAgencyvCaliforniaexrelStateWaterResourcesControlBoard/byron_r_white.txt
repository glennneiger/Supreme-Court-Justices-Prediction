justice
byron
r.
white
first
two
cases,
i
have
for
74-220
hancock,
the
attorney
general
of
kentucky
against
train,
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
74-1435,
environmental
protection
agency
against
california
state
water
resources
control
board.
these
cases
are
related
one
to
the
other
and
they
arise
under
recent
amendments
to
the
clean
air
act
and
to
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
the
issue
in
both
cases
is
whether
federal
installations
and
facilities
must
not
only
comply
with
pollution
standards
set
by
a
state
plan
that
has
been
approved
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
but
whether
the
facilities
must
also
secure
a
permit
which
the
state
plan
requires.
in
the
hancock
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
it
was
not
sufficiently
clear
how
the
clean
air
act
that
the
federal
installations
must
secure
permits
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
arrived
at
just
a
contrary
conclusion
under
the
federal
water
act.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
affirm
his
judgment
and
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
reverse
its
judgment.
the
reasons
for
our
conclusions
are
set
out
in
rather
long
opinions
which
we
have
filed
today.
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
dissent
for
the
reasons
stated
by
the
respective
courts
of
appeals.
