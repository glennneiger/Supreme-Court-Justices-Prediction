mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
presents
the
same
issue
as
the
last
case
with
respect
to
the
need
of
federal
instrumentalities
to
obtain
state
permits,
except
it
arises
under
the
1972
amendments
to
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
the
operative
language
is
the
same
except
for
the
addition
of
six
words
that
i
will
come
to
later.
section
313
of
the
water
act
like
section
118
of
the
air
act
requires
that
federal
instrumentalities
comply
with
the
state
requirements
respecting
control
and
abatement
of
pollution
to
the
same
extent
that
any
person
is
subject
to
such
requirements.
because
of
some
differences
between
the
statutes
however,
i
would
like
briefly
to
outline
to
the
court,
the
regulatory
scheme
under
the
water
act.
prior
to
1972,
the
federal
program
for
the
control
of
water
pollution
was
based
mainly
upon
the
development
by
the
states
of
what
are
called
water
quality
standards.
that
is
a
general
standard
as
to
the
level
of
pollutants
that
would
be
permissible
within
water
and
the
federal
enforcement
role
was
rather
limited.
the
1972
amendments
marked
a
dramatic
shift
in
the
emphasis
and
the
method
by
which
water
pollution
was
to
be
controlled.
instead
of
stressing
primarily
the
quality
of
the
water
generally,
the
act
decided
to
deal
with
what
is
called
point
source
pollution,
the
specific
individual,
the
specific
firm
that
is
polluting
and
the
focus
was
on
what
i
call
technology-based
limitations.
that
is
trying
to
devise
the
best
technology
possible
in
order
to
reduce
the
pollutants
that
each
particular
point
source
makes.
and
this
particular
technique,
the
control
of
the
point
source
pollutants
was
to
be
accomplished
through
a
permit
system.
so
that
this
case
is
unlike
the
other
case
and
that,
in
the
other
case
there
was
no
reference
at
all
to
anything
about
permits.
in
this
case
there
is
an
explicit
scheme
for
permits.
now,
what
the
statute
does
is
it
requires
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
develop
nationwide
standards,
standards
for
effluent
limitations
for
point
source
pollutants
in
various
industries,
it
is
on
industry
by
industry
basis
and
for
example,
they
might
have
a
standard
that
for
cement
plant,
the
cement
plant
cannot
discharge
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
phosphate
for
each
hundred
tons
of
cement
produced.
it
is
that
kind
of
thing
to
determine
the
maximum
permissible
pollutants
from
each
particular
source.
and
it
is
made
illegal
under
section
301
of
the
act
for
any
person
to
discharge
pollutants
into
any
navigable
waters
except
in
compliance
with
the
effluent
limitations
that
the
federal
agency
has
developed
for
the
particular
sources
except
in
compliance
with
the
general
water
quality
standards
that
the
federal
government
and
the
states
have
developed
and
except
in
compliance
with
the
permit
provisions
of
section
402
which
has
created
something
called
the
national
pollutant
discharge
elimination
system.
and
under
that
system,
epa
has
undertaken
decisions
required
to
issue
permits
to
an
individual
discharges
as
long
as
those
discharges
meet
the
standards
it
has
provided
for
effluent
dischargers.
and
to
date,
it
is
issued
more
than
30,000
of
these
permits.
that
is,
the
federal
agency
has
issued
more
than
30,000
of
these
permits.
the
act
further
provides
however
that
a
state
may
itself
submit
a
plan
under
which
it
will
issue
permits
and
if
the
state’s
permit
plan
needs
a
large
variety
of
specified
conditions
in
the
statute
as
well
as
meeting
the
general
standards
then
the
administrator
of
the
epa
is
directed
to
approve
it
and
once
he
approves
it
that
under
the
statute
automatically
terminates
his
authority
to
continue
to
issue
permits.
and,
thus
far
the
administrator
of
the
epa
has
approved
27
different
state
plans
for
state
issuance
of
permits.
the
epa
has
issued
rather
detailed
regulations
governing
the
state
to
permit
plans.
and
one
of
those
regulations
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
that
plans
that
he
approves
for
state
permit
programs
do
not
cover
agencies
and
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government.
this
case
arose
out
of
these
facts.
the
states
of
california
and
washington
submitted
to
the
epa
their
plans
for
a
programed
permit.
epa
approved
those
plans
but
indicated
in
each
instance
that
the
plan
did
not
cover
permits
for
federal
facilities
and
that
the
administrator
would
therefore
continue
to
issue
permits
for
federal
facilities.
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute
the
states
then
took
this
ruling
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
which
held
that
under
this
statute
the
administrator
has
no
authority
to
deny
the
states
the
right
to
issue
permits
for
federal
facilities.
the
arguments
that
i
have
just
made
under
the
clean
air
act
are,
we
think
equally
applicable
to
this
statute.
section
313,
obviously
was
modeled
upon
section
118.
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
like
that
of
section
118,
again
reflects
repeated
emphasis
that
what
the
federal
authorities
ought
to
comply
with
are
the
state
emissions
standards,
the
substantive
things,
the
effluent
limitations,
same
requirements.
there
is
nothing
in
this
history
like
that
under
the
clean
air
act
that
indicates
congress
was
intending
to
require
federal
facilities
to
obtain
state
permits.
now,
there
is
one
distinction
between
the
language
of
section
313
and
the
language
of
118,
which
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
states
of
california
and
washington
argue
calls
for
different
result.
this
is
a
provision
which
where
after
the
statute
says
that
they
shall
comply
with
state
and
federal
requirements
to
the
same
extent
as
any
other
person.
it
then
adds
the
phrase
including
the
payment
of
reasonable
service
charges.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
makes
it
a
strong
--
there
is
a
suggestion,
there
is
a
suggestion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
kentucky’s
case.
and
also
the
suggestion
that
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
us
in
the
kentucky
case,
it
could
go
the
other
way
in
this
case.
the
argument
is
made
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
hold
it
there
is
no
authority
to
acquire
permits
under
the
clean
air
act.
now,
the
argument
is
that
the
words,
including
the
payment
of
reasonable
service
charges
refers
to
charges
that
the
state
might
impose
for
issuing
permits
and
that
since
a
permit
might
be
viewed
in
the
nature
of
attacks,
congress
inserted
this
provision,
in
order
to
make
it
clear
that
the
federal
facilities
could
pay
for
the
state
permits.
we
think
to
the
contrary
that
what
this
refers
to
is
to
make
it
clear
that
the
federal
facilities
will
have
to
comply
with
any
state
requirements
relating
of
treatment
of
waste
materials.
in
this
statute
there
are
number
of
provisions
which
provide
for
vast
federal
funding
and
research
into
the
development
of
adequate
local
waste
treatment
facilities.
and
the
charges
for
those
facilities
are
naturally
extensive
and
we
think
what
congress
intended
in
this
provision
was
that
if
a
state
should
conclude
as
part
of
its
plan,
that
waste
material
would
have
to
be
processed
through
a
local
treatment
facility,
that
the
federal
instrumentalities
would
have
to
comply
with
that
and
they
would
have
to
pay
reasonable
charges
therefore,
not
any
charge
is
the
state,
surfeit
to
impose
but
reasonable
charges.
i
am
told
that
the
fees
for
permits
are
relatively
modest.
an
average
permit
fee
may
sometimes
be
$25.00
to
$50.00
and
state
of
washington
which
is
the
respondent
here
makes
no
charge
for
a
permit
fees
and
it
seems
most
unlikely
that
congress
was
concerned
about
that.
much
more
probable
in
the
light
of
this
whole
statute
it
seems
to
us
is
that
congress
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
in
complying
with
the
federal
standards,
in
complying,
i
am
sorry,
in
complying
with
the
state
standards
federal
facilities
would,
if
the
state
required
compliance
and
going
through
the
local
waste
treatment
plants
would
have
to
do
that.
now,
here
again,
and
under
this
statute
as
under
the
clean
air
act,
there
are
number
of
provisions
within
the
statute
itself,
which
we
think
are
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
congress
intended
to
require
the
federal
facilities
to
get
the
state
permits,
which
once
again
as
i
just
mentioned
and
that
is
why
i
want
to
repeat
it,
require
him
to
get
the
state
permit
means,
the
state
can
tell
him
how
to
operate.
for
example,
there
are
several
provisions
which
authorize
the
states
to
adopt
certain
procedures
and
certain
standards
except
with
respect
to
point
sources
of
pollution
owned
or
operated
by
the
united
states.
one
example
is
section
308
which
provides
and
requires
that
permits
to
be
approvable
must
have
detailed
provisions
governing,
monitoring,
inspection
and
entry
on
to
plants,
obviously
designed
to
ensure
that
there
is
compliance
with
the
substantive
standards
contained
in
the
permits.
the
statute
however
explicitly
provides
that
the
state
standards
are
not
applicable
to
government
facilities.
now,
once
again
it
seems
rather
unlikely
to
us
that
if
congress
intended
to
give
the
states
the
authority
to
require
federal
facilities,
to
obtain
permits
and
then
turned
around
and
said
to
the
states,
you
have
got
to
have
in
your
plans
adequate
provisions
for
monitoring
and
inspection
to
make
sure
that
your
permit
holders
are
complying
with
these
standards,
and
at
the
same
time
would
have
said,
but
you
cannot
do
this
with
respect
to
federal
facilities.
it
is
all
part
of
the
same
thing.
if
the
inspection
and
monitoring
is
that
important
for
compliance
and
if
the
federal
facilities
were
intended
to
have
to
get
state
permits
it
seems
clear
to
us,
congress
would
have
said
and
the
federal
facilities
also
are
subject
to
these
inspection
requirements
but
congress
did
not.
there
is
a
similar
thing
with
respect
to
so-called
new
sources
of
pollution
and
the
statute
is
explicit
that
the
united
states
must
meet
the
new
sources.
once
again,
the
environmental
protection
agency
may
authorize
the
states
to
apply
and
enforce
their
own
standards
of
performance
for
new
sources,
if
they
equal
the
federal
standards
except
for
new
sources
owned
or
operated
by
the
united
states.
here
too,
we
think
it
most
unlikely
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
require
and
authorize
the
states
to
issue
permits
for
federal
facilities
it
would
have
denied
the
states
the
authority
to
enforce
those
permits
against
federal
facilities
where
the
very
standards
sought
to
be
enforced
of
those
contained
in
the
permits.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
a
number
of
other
examples
and
instances
in
which
the
whole
statutory
scheme,
the
use
of
the
language,
the
way
it
structured
the
various
provisions
seem
to
us
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
when
it
used
these
general
words
to
comply
with
the
requirements
respecting
pollution
of
states,
federal
and
local
sources
that
congress
intended
thereby
to
give
the
states
in
effect
what
amounts
to
a
veto
power
over
the
operation
of
federal
facilities,
usually
on
federal
land
within
the
state
unless,
the
state
decides
that
it
wishes
to
authorize
the
federal
facilities
so
to
operate.
once
again,
as
in
the
clean
air
act
we
think
something
much
more
explicit
and
specific
is
required
than
what
we
have
in
either
this
language
or
in
this
legislative
history
which
--
i
reiterate
again,
indicates
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
the
effluent
limitations
and
not
the
procedures
that
the
state
might
device
in
order
to
achieve
compliance
with
those
requirements
by
the
private
firms
and
people
within
the
state.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
let
me
just
briefly
allude
to
the
argument
that
mr.
gorton
has
made
with
reference
to
section
505
(f)
6
and
what
that
says
that
in
effect
a
citizen
suit
maybe
brought
against
a
federal
instrumentality
which
is
alleged
to
be
violating
an
effluent
standard
or
limitation
and
then
it
says
that
an
effluent
standing
or
limitation
includes
a
permit
or
condition
thereof
issued
under
402
of
the
act
which
is
in
effect
under
the
act
including
a
requirement
applicable
by
reason
of
section
313
of
the
act.
we
think
that
the
requirement
applicable
by
reason
of
section
313
of
the
act
refers
to
is
a
substantive
standard
imposed
in
a
federal
permit.
not
in
the
state
permit
in
a
federal
permit
that
has
been
issued
to
a
federal
facility.
i
would
like
to
also
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice.
but
it
does
come
back
to
that
but
my
point
they
say
that
the
fact
that
there
is
reference
to
a
requirement
of
313
in
505
f
6
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
conclude
one
way
or
the
other
it
is
easy
what
they
say
is
the
fact
as
a
reference
to
requirement
on
the
313
necessarily
indicates
that
313
requirements
includes
the
state
permit
system.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
say
as
it
means
as
substantive
requirement
either
in
a
--
it
means
a
substantive
requirement
in
a
federal
permit
mr.
justice.
that
is
our
point
that
if
they
are
right
if
it
is
--
it
could
mean
more
of
two
things.
it
could
not
mean
the
substantive
requirement
in
a
permit
because
we
say
the
states
have
no
authority
to
require
permits
for
federal
facilities.
but
we
do
say
it
means
the
same
substantive
requirement
which
may
be
included
in
a
federal
permit
that
has
been
issued
to
a
federal
facility.
if
i
may
just
refer
briefly
to
one
point
you
made
earlier
as
to
whether
the
permit
program
under
section
402
is
a
mandatory
program.
the
environmental
protection
agency
takes
the
position
that
it
is.
that
they
have
to
have
a
permit
program
that
is
the
whole
scheme
of
the
statute
to
control
point
source
pollution
by
a
program
of
permits.
first
to
be
issued
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
then
if
a
satisfactory
state
permit
program
is
included
by
the
state.
now,
the
suggestion
is
made
of
that
because
the
statute
requires
and
terminates
the
authority
of
the
administrator
to
issue
federal
permits
once
he
approves
a
state
permit
program.
if
he
approves
a
state
permit
program
that
means
one
of
two
things,
either
that
is
entire
authority
to
issue
permits
to
federal
facilities
as
terminated
or
as
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
brief
that
somehow
when
he
gets
rid
of
his
authority
to
issue
permits,
that
means
somehow
the
states
get.
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
we
are
correct
in
our
position
that
there
is
no
authority
under
this
statute
for
the
states
to
compel
federal
instrumentalities
to
obtain
permits,
that
when
the
administrator
approves
a
state
plan
which
provides
for
the
state
issuance
of
permits
necessarily,
he
cannot
approve
the
plan
insofar
as
it
purports
to
give
the
states
authority
to
issue
permits
for
federal
facilities.
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
permits
that
and
we
think
inherit
in
the
whole
concept
is
when
he
approves
a
plan,
all
that
he
can
approve
and
all
that
he
loses
authority
to
issue
is
with
respect
to
those
portions
of
the
state
plan
that
are
valid
and
if
the
state
plan
is
invalid
as
he
held
in
his
regulation
and
as
he
held
in
these
two
cases.
if
it
is
invalid
because
under
the
statute
the
state
cannot
require
a
federal
instrumentality
to
obtain
a
permit,
then
necessarily
his
approval
of
the
state
plan
does
not
touch
upon
that
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
think
they
have
to
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
our
answer
to
that
is
that
the
authority
to
issue
permits
does
not
stand
from
313,
it
stems
from
402.
all
that
313
does
is
state
that
the
federal
facilities
must
comply
with
the
substantive
requirements
of
state
and
federal
law.
however
those
requirements
were
imposed.
whether
they
are
imposed
under
a
state
program,
whether
the
state
has
some
sort
of
a
regulatory
scheme
that
does
not
matter
as
long
as
the
state
imposes
substantive
requirements,
313
requires
that
the
federal
instrumentality
is
comply.
but
there
is
nothing
in
313
that
speaks
of
permits.
the
whole
argument
is
whether
the
word
requirements
in
313
covers
permits.
but
313
does
not
authorize
any
issuance
of
permits.
the
permits
are
issued
by
the
federal
system
under
--
by
the
administrator
under
402
if
the
administrator
delegates
to
the
states,
the
authority
to
issue
such
permits
then
they
have
that
authority
under
402.
but
you
look
to
402
only
to
see
who
can
issue
permits?
but
the
authority
to
issue
permits
and
the
requirement
that
there
be
compliance
with
the
substantive
standards
either
in
the
permits
or
else
where
is
what
317
does.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
would
not
have
--
no,
because
under
402
the
only
state
plan
is
a
state
plan
for
a
permit.
now
he
could
have
approved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
is
right.
the
only
state
because
--
and
then
the
federal
permit
plan
would
continue
in
operation,
that
is
what
we
have
and
23
states
have
not
submitted
and
do
not
have
any
state,
any
federally
delegated,
federally
approved
permit
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
state
could
not
impose
other
requirements.
but
a
state
might
have
a
permit
plan
which
is
very
different
from
the
federal
standards
which
it
would
apply
within
the
state
but
nevertheless
there
would
still
be
the
federal
permit
plan.
the
only
way
that
the
state
can
oust
the
epa
plan
which
is
in
operation
is
if
it
submits
a
plan
which
epa
approves.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
epa
would
have
to
disapprove
that
plan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
its
entirety.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
different—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
the
statute
is
different
because
one
of
the
key
elements
of
this
is
a
permit
plan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it
seems
to
us
its
–
there
has
been
a
suggestion
here
that
somehow
because
you
have
a
permit
plan
generally,
that
necessarily
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
impose
that
same
kind
of
permits
issued
by
the
states
upon
the
federal
authorities
and
the
state
authority.
it
seems
to
us
it
is
a
very
different
thing
i
like
to
conclude
on
this
note.
between
saying
that
the
federal
instrumentalities
have
to
comply
with
the
substantive
requirements
that
the
state
has
imposed
which
is
what
congress
has
done
section
370
and
to
take
the
next
and
to
us
a
very
large
step
of
saying
and
it
is
the
states,
it
is
the
states
and
not
the
federal
government
that
can
require
the
federal
instrumentalities
to
do
that.
we
do
not
think
congress
has
gone
that
far
in
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
they
negotiate,
they
do
it
they
can
announce
it
for
a
particular,
they
can
come
in
and
talk
and
they
could
say
for
a
particular
point,
you
cannot
throw
into
the
water
more
than
ten
gallons
chlorine
a
day.
they
can
come
in,
they
talk
to
these
people,
they
can
work
the
thing
out
and
then
the
federal
people
would
be
required
to
comply
with
that.
we
do
not
accept
this
notion
that
the
only
way
you
can
have
meaningful
effluent
standards
is
through
a
state
permit
program.
