justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
government
does
not
have
to
follow
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
that
says
that
federal
government
has
to
follow
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
the
solicitor
general’s
point
is
that
if
you
want
to
subject
the
federal
government
to
permit,
you
have
to
say
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
practically?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
included
permits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
could
feel,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
to
give
up
a
certain
point.
because
i
understand
the
government’s
point,
they
are
willing
to
go
along
with
everything
but
this
permit
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
be
it
impossible
for
the
state
to
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)--
difficult.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
more
difficult
for
you
to
track
that
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
just
wants
the
federal
government
to
say
we
are
bound
by
you
to
the
state
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
next
step
is
by
permit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
will
not
settle
for
less?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
walston,
suppose
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
says
that
you
must
not
discharge
more
than
one
point
million
whatever
it
is,
certain
kind
of
liquid
into
a
stream,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
federal
government
has
got
to
abide
with
it,
right?
well
now,
i
suppose
the
state
says,
you
cannot
discharge
more
than
one
point
blank
the
same
figure,
can
also
get
a
permit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
benefit
of
the
permit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
once
the
federal
government
said,
you
go
ahead
and
tell
me
how
much
i
can
do,
right?.
is
that
okay
without
a
permit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
federal
government
says
we
have
got
plant
x,
you
tell
us
how
much
we
can
discharge
and
we
will
buy
it
back
but
we
will
not
give
you
–
we
will
not
apply
for
a
permit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
they
said
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
they
still
have
to
get
a
permit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
we
do
not
agree
with
you
on
what
313
means
and
that
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
before
we
get
to
all
of
that,
you
lose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
you
lose?
