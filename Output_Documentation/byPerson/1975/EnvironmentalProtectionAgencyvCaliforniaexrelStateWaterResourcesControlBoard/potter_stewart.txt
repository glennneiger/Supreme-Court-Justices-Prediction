did
you
say
that
they
think
this
--
that
language
calls
in
leads
to
a
different
result
in
this
case
or
rather
just
makes
it
a
stronger
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
stronger
case
than
kentuckyâ€™s
case.--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
vice
versa,
very
well,
yes,
if
the
court
could
agree
with
you,
we
should
agree
with
you
--.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
point
is
that,
under
any
consistent
reading
of
the
statutory
language
and
the
administrator
too
would
lose
any
authority
to
issue
permits.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
basic
402
argument,
which
i
understand.
i
think
you
are
beginning
to
explain
a
specific
and
more
limited
argument
with
respect
to
402
(c)
a
few
minutes
ago
when
we
interrupted
you
with
question
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
that
language,
can
you
tell
us
where
the
language
is?
justice
potter
stewart
where
in
the
papers
filed,
in
the
briefs
served.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
has
specific
reference
to
402
(c)?
