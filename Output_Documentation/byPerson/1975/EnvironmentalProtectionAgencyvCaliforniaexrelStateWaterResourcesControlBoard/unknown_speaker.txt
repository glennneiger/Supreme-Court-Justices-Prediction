the
less.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walston
can
i
ask
the
question
about
the
federal
permit
program?
as
i
read
402
(a),
the
whole
federal
permit
program
is
permissive
rather
than
mandatory.
do
you
understand
that
the
federal
government
is
required
to
issue
permits
rather
than
for
example
setting
general
limitations
which
must
be
provided
across
the
board?
unknown
speaker
that
everything
must
be
done
on
a
permit
by
permit
basis?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
it
quite
says
that
mr.
gorton,
i
do
not
so
read
it
maybe
that
is
the
way
it
is
generally
understood.
where
do
we
find
that?
unknown
speaker
we
will
find
that
in
the
papers
--
unknown
speaker
it
says,
except
that
it
is
in
compliance
with
this
section
in
section
402
among
other
section.
unknown
speaker
the
discharge
is
unlawful.
but
what
is
it
that
says
one
is
not
in
compliance
with
402
if
there
has
been
no
permit
program
instituted?
the
permit
program
provided
by,
specified
in
402
is
permissive
as
what
i
am
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
and
as
the
federal
permit
program.
unknown
speaker
i
could
not
read
that
i
just
suggest
this
is
possibility
to
allow
a
specific
permit
of
greater
discharge
than
the
limitation
would
normally
authorized.
unknown
speaker
so
well,
just
to
get
my
thought
out
so
that
you
can
address
would
it
not
be
consistent
with
the
scheme
of
the
act
for
the
federal
government
have
a
general
effluent
limitation.
and
then
some
permits
which
are
more
liberal.
unknown
speaker
then
would
it
not
follow
that
the
abandonment
or
suspension
of
a
federal
permit
program
within
a
given
state
would
not
remove
all
federal
control
over
discharges
within
that
state.
unknown
speaker
the
limitations
would
still
apply
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
just
to
get
my
last
question
so
i
understand
this.
do
you
understand
that
the
federal
government
would
have
the
authority
to
disapprove
of
a
state
permit
program
on
the
ground
that
it
was
too
severe?
unknown
speaker
(voice

unknown
speaker
is
this
color,
whatever
the
color
is,
funny
color.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman
that
depends
on
that
if
you
answer
the
case
when
you
say
that,
that
depends
on
how
you
read
313
does
it
not?
and
it
is
never
really
decided.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
you
said
mr.
friedman;
would
the
administrator
approve
a
state
plan
that
did
not
have
a
permit
system?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
the
state
does
not
have
a
permit
system
their
plan
will
be
disapproved?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
a
state
submits
a
plan
that
has
only
substantive
standards
and
had
no
permit
system,
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
in
its
entirety?
unknown
speaker
so
in
that
respect,
this
statute
is
different
from
the
federal
statute,
different
from
the
air
legislation
--
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
require
that
state
plans
have
permits.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman
can
i
just
ask
one
question,
is
there
anyway
for
a
state
to
articulate
a
substantive
requirement
except
through
a
permit?
