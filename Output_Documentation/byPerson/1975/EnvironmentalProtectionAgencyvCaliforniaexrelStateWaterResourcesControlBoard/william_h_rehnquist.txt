they
are
willing
to
supply
the
information.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
federal
facilities
in
california
have
been
unwilling
to
comply
with
or
substantially
comply
with
that
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
a
practical
matter
that
is
california
up
to
now
have
been
able
to
get
the
kind
of
information
you
say
that
it
is
essential
for
it
to
get
in
order
to
evolve
these
effluent
limitation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
are
suggesting
mr.
walston
is
that
the
state
substantive
regulation
do
not
simply
exist
as
a
body
of
common
law
that
can
be
plucked
out
and
applied
to
a
particular
individual
by
the
epa
but
rather
that
they
are
developed
in
the
permit
application
procedure
almost
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
