mr.
roderick
walston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
general
argues
in
this
case
that
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
kentucky
case.
however,
in
one
fundamental
respect
our
case
is
very
different
from
the
kentucky
case
and
that
is
that
our
case
has
a
specific
permit
provision
in
section
402
of
the
water
act
that
is
applicable
to
all
dischargers.
thus
there
is
expressed
authority
in
the
water
act
for
states
and
the
administrator
himself
issue
permits
to
discharges
and
that
--
as
that
authorities
found
in
section
402
of
the
water
act
and
thus
the
only
issue
on
the
court
is
whether
the
states
have
authority
to
apply
this
permits
to
federal
dischargers.
so
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
this
case
and
the
kentucky
case
in
that
respect.
and
the
administrator
argues
that
section
313
which
imposes
an
obligation
on
federal
dischargers
to
comply
with
all
the
requirements
under
the
act
does
not
include
permits
under
section
402.
now,
that
result
would
lead
to
a
very
illogical
result
especially
as
applied
to
the
administrator’s
case.
for
the
administrator
concedes
that
federal
dischargers
have
to
comply
with
permits
which
he,
the
administrator
himself
issues
in
states
where
he
operates
his
own
npdes
permit
program.
well,
what
is
the
source
that
obligation,
where
does
the
administrator
himself
get
authority
to
issue
permits
to
federal
dischargers.
that
authority
has
to
be
found
in
section
313
of
the
water
act
because
that
is
the
only
provision
in
the
water
act
that
defines
the
obligation
of
federal
dischargers
under
the
act.
and
that
section
specifically
provides
that
federal
dischargers
must
comply
with
both
state
requirements
and
federal
requirements.
and
therefore
the
word
requirements
in
313
must
include
section
402
permits
or
otherwise
the
administrator
himself
would
lack
authority
to
issue
permits
to
federal
dischargers.
and
under
that
result
of
course
federal
dischargers
would
be
entirely
exempt
from
the
402
permit
provisions
of
the
act
and
the
administrator
himself
in
this
case
has
conceded
that
that
is
not
the
result
to
be
implied
that
congress
indeed
intended
for
federal
dischargers
to
comply
with
the
402
permit
program.
and
thus
the
administrator’s
position
results
in
a
very
difficult
dilemma
which
the
administrator
has
yet
failed
to
address
in
this
case.
either
the
word
requirement
includes
section
402
permits
or
it
does
not.
and
if
it
does,
it
must
include
permits
issued
by
the
states
and
if
it
does
not,
the
administrator
himself
lacks
authority
to
issue
permits
to
federal
dischargers.
now,
the
court
asked
a
number
of
questions
in
the
kentucky
case
that
i
think
are
partially
applicable
at
least
to
the
issues
in
this
court,
in
this
case.
first,
justice
burger,
marshall
and
blackmun
asked
the
question
of
why
does
the
state
have
authority
or
need
authority
to
issue
permits
to
federal
dischargers?
well,
the
answer
in
our
case
is
that
the
permit
process
itself
is
the
very
process
by
which
an
effluent
limitation
is
developed
with
respect
to
a
federal
discharger.
the
permit
process
is
the
process
which
enables
the
state
to
get
the
necessary
information
it
needs
to
define
the
effluent
limitation
to
be
imposed
on
the
discharger
himself.
there
is
a
number
of
questions
that
have
to
be
asked
of
these
dischargers
and
we
have
to
get
answers
from
them,
for
instance,
what
are
the
--
mr.
roderick
walston
pardon
me.
mr.
roderick
walston
well,
they
are
not
willing
to
supply
the
information
that
the
state
necessarily
requests.
for
instance,
california
has
an
administrative
procedural
process
which
requires
all
dischargers
to
come
to
the
state
to
undergo
cross-examination
to
offer
documentary
data
and
so
forth.
that
i
suppose
would
be
classified
as
a
procedural
requirement
under
the
administrator’s
view.
mr.
roderick
walston
as
practical
matter
they
have
not.
as
a
practical
matter
the
federal
dischargers
in
california
have
historically
complied
with
state
administrative
procedural
requirements.
they
have
gone
to
the
states
or
to
the
state
of
california
and
they
have
got
permits
from
the
state
of
california.
and
thus
the
administrative
practice
in
california
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
position,
the
theoretical
position
being
advanced
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
federal
dischargers
in
california
have
in
fact
complied
with
the
procedural
requirements
of
california.
obviously
if
they
were
not
required
to
so
comply
as
the
solicitor
general
says
they
need
not
comply
then
california
could
not
get
the
information
that
it
has
historically
obtained
through
the
administrative
permit
process.
there
is
a
second
answer
to
the
argument
or
the
question
which
was
posed
by
the
various
justices
and
that
is
this,
the
administrator
himself
cannot
issue
permits
to
federal
dischargers
once
he
approves
a
state
program
by
virtue
of
section
402
(c)
of
the
water
act.
that
provision
requires
the
administrator
to
suspend
his
permit
issuing
authority
in
the
entire
state
after
he
approves
the
state
program.
thus,
if
the
administrator
himself
cannot
issue
these
permits
then
nobody
can
according
to
solicitor
general’s
position
in
this
case.
mr.
roderick
walston
i
think
that
is
a
probably
a
correct
statement
of
law
your
honor.
but
i
do
not
think
the
question
is
really
applicable
here.
section
313
of
the
water
act
constitutes
a
clear
waiver
of
federal
immunity
from
state
regulation.
it
specifically
provides
that
federal
dischargers
have
to
comply
with
state
and
local
requirements.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
this
language
obligates
federal
dischargers
to
comply
with
state
of
limitations.
so
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
or
federal
immunity
in
this
case,
all
we
are
talking
about
is
the
extent
or
the
scope
of
the
waiver.
as
i
say,
it
seems
to
me
implicit
in
the
concept
that
the
state
has
the
authority
to
issue
effluent
limitations
to
assume
they
are
from
--
the
state
has
the
authority
to
issue
the
permit
which
contains
those
limitations.
mr.
roderick
walston
pardon
me.
mr.
roderick
walston
section
313
--
mr.
roderick
walston
well
we
think
that
congress
said
that
in
section
313
(voice
overlap)
pardon
me.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes.
and
we
think
that
congress
spelled
that
out
in
section
313.
congress
said
--
mr.
roderick
walston
well,
if
it
must
have
included
permits
because
this
is
the
only
--
section
313
is
the
only
authority
that
the
administrator
himself
has
to
issue
permits
the
federal
dischargers.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes.
and
we
feel
that
that
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
the
state
to
actually
develop
it.
mr.
roderick
walston
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
mr.
roderick
walston
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
state
to
develop
an
effective,
meaningful
limitation,
effluent
limitation
unless
it
--
somehow
had
the
authority
to
engage
the
--
mr.
roderick
walston
well,
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
impossible,
i
suppose
that
is
true
but
it
is
certainly
very
difficult.
i
think
that
is
true.
of
course,
the
state
could
shoot
in
the
dark
--
mr.
roderick
walston
yes,
i
suppose
that
is
true.
in
other
words
the
state
could
--
mr.
roderick
walston
yes.
maybe
it
is
very
difficult
--
mr.
roderick
walston
pardon
me.
mr.
roderick
walston
we
do
not
think
--
we
will
not
settle
for
less
because
we
do
not
think
congress
settled
for
less.
we
do
not
see
a
distinction
between
the
permit
process
and
the
effluent
limitation
that
is
contained
in
the
permit.
i
suppose
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
marshall
that
the
state
could
certainly
shoot
in
the
dark,
it
could
throw
out
some
effluent
limitations
based
on
very
poor
data
that
federal
discharger
himself
might
voluntarily
submit.
but
we
would
not
have
any
insurance
that
that
is
a
very
meaningful
effluent
limitation.
we
cannot
do
that,
we
cannot
form
an
effective
meaningful
limitation
unless
we
have
got
the
federal
discharger
in
there
to
find
out
for
example,
how
long
it
is
going
to
take
him
to
solve
his
water
pollution
problems.
in
others,
what
kind
of
schedule
of
compliance
for
example,
has
to
be
built
into
the
--
the
federal
permit
--
mr.
roderick
walston
that
is
precisely
correct
and
that
is
the
whole
concept
justice
rehnquist
to
the
permit
system
in
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
the
permit
system
enables
the
states
or
the
administrators,
the
case
maybe
to
develop
effluent
limitations
that
are
applicable
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
permit
by
permit
basis
to
each
individual
discharger.
the
state
cannot
develop
a
broad
effluent
limitation
that
is
broadly
applicable
to
everybody.
it
has
to
develop
a
limitation
by
looking
at
the
exigencies
of
the
specific
particular
discharge.
and,
the
solicitor
general’s
position
would
not
allow
the
states
to
do
that.
next,
justice
powell
asked
the
question
of
whether
the
states
could
prevent
federal
dischargers
actually
from
operating.
could
the
states
for
instance
shut
down
fort
knox?
well,
there
are
two
answers
there.
first
of
all,
section
313
of
the
water
act
specifically
authorizes
the
president
to
exempt
a
federal
effluent
source
if
he
deems
that
exemption
to
be
in
a
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states.
and
thus,
the
president
could
simply
say,
you
cannot
shut
down
fort
knox,
state
of
kentucky,
simply
because
i
exempt
fort
knox.
mr.
roderick
walston
i
suppose
hypothetically
that
if
the
state
refused
to
issue
a
permit
the
discharger
then
could
not
operate.
i
suppose
that
is
true.
as
a
practical
matter
the
states
do
not
that.
they
issue
the
permit
and
then
impose
the
effluent
limitations
in
the
permit
itself.
so,
the
effluent
limitations
are
the
conditions,
which
the
discharger
must
meet
and
this
leads
into
the
second
response
to
that
question
and
i
think
justice
rehnquist
appreciated
this
response.
we
get
the
same
result
even
under
the
administrator’s
view
of
this
case.
for
he
concedes
that
federal
discharger
have
to
comply
with
state
effluent
limitations.
well,
it
is
the
effluent
limitation
that
defines
the
specific
nature
of
the
obligation
on
the
federal
discharger,
the
permit
itself
is
little
more
than
a
certification
that
the
dischargers
are
complying
with
those
limitations.
but
if
the
effluent
limitations
that
tells
the
discharger
what
steps
he
must
take
to
correct
water
pollution,
to
stop
polluting
the
water
and
when
he
must
take
these
steps.
and
so
hypothetically,
i
suppose
a
state
could
develop
such
a
stringent
effluent
limitation
justice
powell
that
the
practical
effect
would
be
to
shut
down
the
federal
facility.
mr.
roderick
walston
the
administrator
concedes
that
--.
mr.
roderick
walston
the
state
says
that?
mr.
roderick
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
walston
the
permit
enables
the
states
to
make
that
determination
about
the
1.1
figure
that
the
federal
discharger
has
to
live
with.
if
the
state
cannot
issue
the
permit
and
engage
in
the
administrative
process
that
leads
to
the
issuance
of
the
permit,
it
may
not
know
whether
the
1.1
figure
is
correct
or
whether
1.2
figure
would
be
correct
or
whether
the
figure
should
be
five
or
three
or
two
or
whatever.
mr.
roderick
walston
i
did
not
quite
appreciate
the
question.
mr.
roderick
walston
well,
certainly
the
federal
government
in
that
case,
the
federal
discharger
has
to
comply
and
live
with
that
particular
limitation.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes.
they
agree
with
that.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes
under
section
313
--
mr.
roderick
walston
well,
section
313
of
the
water
act
requires
that.
section
313
requires
federal
dischargers
to
comply
with
state
requirements
respecting
control
and
abatement
of
pollution.
mr.
roderick
walston
it
is
not
only
that
is
it.
it
means
that
the
federal
dischargers
themselves
are
completely
exempt
from
section
402
permit
provisions.
and
the
administrators,
this
is
the
--
mr.
roderick
walston
well,
we
lose
the
administrator,
the
administrator
loses
his
own
authority
to
issue
permits.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
mr.
roderick
walston
precisely.
mr.
roderick
walston
the
402
(c)
requires
the
administrator
to
suspend
the
issuance
of
permits
in
to
a
state
once
he
suspend
his
issuance
of
permits
in
that
particular
state
once
he
approves
the
state
program.
and
thus,
under
that
result
the
administrator
once
he
approves
the
state
program
does
not
have
authority
to
issue
permits
to
anybody.
federal
dischargers
or
anybody,
so
what
i
am
saying
is
that
once
the
administrator
approves
a
state
permit
program
he
does
not
have
any
authority
to
issue
permits
to
federal
dischargers
under
the
language
of
the
act.
well,
that
leads
the
result
into
the
--
mr.
roderick
walston
yes,
it
is
in
the
section
402
(c)
of
the
--
mr.
roderick
walston
page
--
california’s
brief,
page
11.
mr.
roderick
walston
and
along
these
lines,
i
would
like
to
confirm
that
result,
justice
stewart
by
quoting
the
senate
and
house
report
which
describe
the
effect
of
section
402
©.
now
listen
carefully,
this
is
the
house
report
now
page
854
of
the
one
legislative
history
volumes,
“upon
approval
of
the
state
program,
the
administrator
would
suspend
the
issuance
of
permits
for
dischargers
in
to
the
waters
of
that
state”
that
is
the
house
report.
the
senate
report
mr.
roderick
walston
and
the
senate
report
and
we
did
quote
the
senate
report
in
our
brief
page
10
at
footnote
10,
states
as
follows,
“therefore
the
bill
provides
that
after
a
states
submits
a
program
which
meets
the
criteria
established
by
the
administrator
pursuant
to
regulations,
the
administrator
shall
suspend
his
activity
in
such
state
under
the
federal
permit
program.
thus,
once
the
administrator
approves
the
state
program
he
loses
the
authority
to
issue
permits
that
any
discharger
federal
or
otherwise
and
that
he
has
no
authority
to
issue
permits
to
federal
dischargers
once
he
approves
the
state
program”.
mr.
roderick
walston
we
believe
that
section
402
is
mandatory
as
quite
the
federal
dischargers
by
virtue
of
section
of
313.
mr.
roderick
walston
yes,
that
is
correct.
thank
you
your
honor.
