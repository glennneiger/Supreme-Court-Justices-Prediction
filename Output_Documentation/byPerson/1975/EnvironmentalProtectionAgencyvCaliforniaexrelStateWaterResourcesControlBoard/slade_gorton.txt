mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
basic
answer
to
your
last
question
is
that
there
are
of
course
a
number
of
sections
of
this
act
which
are
of
great
importance.
the
one
which
answers
your
last
questions
is
section
301
which
is
the
prohibitory
section
of
the
act.
that
says
thou
shall
not
without
a
permit.
this
means
--
mr.
slade
gorton
all
right,
section
301
(a)
except—
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
not
sure
but
301
is
quoted
in
full
in
any
of
the
briefs
that
maybe
in
ours.
mr.
slade
gorton
right,
the
discharge
in
a
pollutant.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
federal
permit
program
is
a
--
thus
it
is
true
that
the
federal
program
says
that
the
second
line
of
section
402
says
that
the
administrator
may
issue
a
permit
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
this
is
why
we
have—
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
the
scheme
of
the
program.
we
have
certain
goals
set
out
in
the
statute
for
1977,
others
for
1985.
those
goals
are
not
met
by
the
conditions
of
the
permits
which
are
issued
today.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
because
the
state
under
section
510
has
the
right
to
impose
more
stringent
limitations
than
does
the
federal
government
itself.
that
state
authority
is
specifically
not
only
preserved
but
perhaps
as
you
may
say
created
by
section
510.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
the
federal
government
would
not
have
the
authority
to
disapprove
because
of
510.
we
must
meet
nine
qualifications
under
section
402
(b)
to
be
authorized
to
have
a
permit
program.
when
we
have
met
those
nine
qualifications,
we
are
entitled
to
manage
our
own
permit
program
but
that
permit
program
and
our
effluent
limitations
maybe
more
respective
than
those
which
the
epa
administrator
had
operated
under
section
402
(a).
this
is
consistent,
i
would
like
to
go
back
if
i
can
and
walk
through
several
sections
of
the
statute
and
just
a
bit
of
history.
up
in
the
1970
of
course
as
the
solicitor
and
we
agree.
only
the
states
could
issue
permits
in
water
pollution
control
matters.
in
1970,
the
president
discovered
the
1899
refuse
act
and
the
core
of
engineers
begin
to
issue
permits
to
water
polluters.
this
of
course
created
a
duplicatory
and
relatively
wasteful
system
besides
having
the
core
of
engineers
involved
in
it.
which
it
was
one
of
the
principal
designs
of
the
1972
act
to
cure,
it
wanted
to
get
rid
of
that
duplicatory
system.
so
the
permit
system
in
402
first
says,
under
402
(a)
epa
issues
permits.
second,
it
says
in
section
402
(b)
and
this
was
expected
and
it
is
explicitly
listed
in
the
sponsor’s
remarks
about
the
act.
that
as
soon
as
the
states
met
federal
qualifications.
the
epa
must
approve
the
state
plan.
not
may
at
one
point
it
did
say
may.
but
as
the
act
that
was
passed,
it
said
must
approve
the
states
plans
and
under
402
(c)
must
promptly
suspend
the
issuance
of
its
own
permits.
now,
402,
we
all
agree
it
contains
no
exemptions
for
federal
agencies.
but
during
the
course
of
the
passage
of
that
act
through
congress
at
one
point
it
did
contain
an
exemption
for
federal
agencies
from
one
relatively
limited
element
of
section
402.
but
that
was
not
only
taken
out
by
the
conference
committee
but
the
conference
committee
report
shows
that
it
was
taken
out
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
should
not
have
that
specific
exemption.
section
301
refers
to
persons,
the
prohibition
of
section
301
refers
to
persons
and
as
the
basic
prohibitory
section
of
the
act.
but
federal
agencies
are
not
included
within
the
definition
of
persons
in
section
502,
subsection
5.
so
if
it
were
not
for
section
313,
epa
could
not
issue
permits
to
federal
entities.
and
of
course,
neither
could
states.
section
313
as
my
colleague
from
california
has
already
said
is
the
reason
epa
can
issue
permits
as
well
the
states.
and
it
lands
them
directly
together.
it
says
federal
agencies
are
to
comply
with
federal
and
state
requirements
respecting
control
of
the
abatement
of
pollution
to
the
same
extent
that
any
person
is
subject
to
such
requirements.
so
the
federal
agencies
seek
402
(a)
permits
or
402
(b)
permits
by
a
reason
of
exactly
the
same
authority.
and
if
the
word
“requirements”
in
the
statute
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
broad
enough
to
include
procedural
matters,
i.e.
state
permits
under
402
(b)
it
is
not
broad
enough
to
include
federal
procedural
requirement
or
permits
under
402
(a).
the
authority
of
the
epa
and
the
states
are
identical.
now
not
only
is
this
a
wrong
and
absurd
result
because
it
would
free
federal
agencies
from
any
obligations
to
secure
any
permits
at
all
and
because
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
requirements
has
to
be
totally
distorted
for
you
to
come
to
that
kind
of
answer.
it
is
also
wrong-
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
right.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
right.
this
part
of
the
distinction
would
still
theoretically
exist
but
neither
we
nor
epa
makes
the
claim
of
course,
that
epa
does
no
want
make
claim
that
federal
entities
are
free
from
the
permit,
its
own
permit
requirements.
but
there
is
another
matter
which
helps
in
this
connection
as
well.
and
this
may
answer
directly
your
question.
if
you
go
to
section
505
f6,
505
f6
or
505
is
the
so
called
citizen
suit
provision
of
the
statute
which
means
that
if
epa
does
not
do
its
job
and
the
state
does
not
do
its
job.
a
citizen
can
come
in
and
bring
a
lawsuit
in
order
to
enforce
the
act.
under
that,
an
effluent
limitation,
i.e.
the
substance
that
the
solicitor
is
talking
about
is
defined
in
505
f6
as
a
section
402
permit.
that
is
to
say
there
is
no
distinction
between
substance
and
procedure.
and
then
in
parenthesis
which
is
also
includes
a
section
313
requirement.
right
back
to
the
very
word
which
the
solicitor
claims
does
not
include
permits.
effluent
limitations
permits
requirements,
all
fall
within
the
same
category
mr.
slade
gorton
page
19
of—
mr.
slade
gorton
it
will
be
on
page
19
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
this
is
the
california
brief.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
it
is
probably
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
as
well.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
of
the
gray.
mr.
slade
gorton
right
and
let
me
read
it.
section
505
describes
“an
effluent
standard
or
limitation”
as
including
“a
permit
or
condition
there
of
issued
under
section
402
of
this
act
which
is
in
effect
under
this
act
(including
a
requirement
applicable
by
reason
of
section
313
of
this
act)”.
and
the
only
answer
the
solicitor
has
to
that
proposition
is
that
the
first
five
subsections
of
that
subsection
are
not
requirements
and
that
therefore
this
does
not
mean
anything.
but
first
five
subsections
are
not
included
in
the
parenthetical
expression.
it
is
a
known
secret
or
even
so
much
as
to
argue
that
point.
mr.
slade
gorton
no
states,
your
honor.
this
is
not
like
the
air
case.
this
is
not
like
the
air
case—
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
this
is
not
that
kind;
there
are
27
states
as
the
solicitor
general
says
which
have
qualified
to
operate
their
own
permit
system.
but
in
the
other
23,
the
administrator
continues
to
operate
a
permit
system.
this
is
the
current
number.
now,
the
united
states
claims
that
because
federal
agencies
are
expressly
exempted
from
state
procedures
enforcing
new
source
standards
by
the
terms
of
306
(c)
of
the
act
and
because
federal
agencies
are
expressly
exempted
from
state
procedures
for
inspection
monitoring
and
entry
with
respect
to
point
sources
within
the
state
by
the
terms
of
308
(c)
an
exemption
from
the
state
permit
programs
authorized
by
section
402
(b)
has
got
to
be
implied.
now
there
are
two
reasons
why
this
is
not
so.
the
first
is,
because
each
of
those
exemptions
not
to
mention
another
in
401
(a)
which
is
irrelevant
to
this
argument
and
the
original
house
version
which
was
right
in
section
402
itself
and
which
removed
by
the
conference
committee.
each
of
these
shows
graphically
that
the
congress
know
perfectly
well
how
to
exempt
federal
agencies
from
specific
water
control
act
programs
when
it
wished
to
do
so.
not
only
did
it
not
do
so,
in
either
section
402
or
313
it
even
expunged
the
partial
exemption
which
originally
appeared
in
section
402
in
the
house
version,
and
the
legislative
history,
which
we
shall
find
noted
on
page
30
of
the
california
brief,
expressly
shows
that
the
conference
committee
knew
exactly
what
it
was
doing
in
taking
out
that
particular
exemption.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
in
the
case
of
306
(c)
and
308
(c)
these
were
fragmented
and
limited
programs.
306
(c)
applied
or
section
306
applies
only
to
new
source
standards,
that
is
a
new
factory
or
your
new
installation.
and
section
308
creates
a
way
in
which
there
will
be
inspection
and
monitoring
a
procedural
matter.
i
think
essentially
as
opposed
to
substantive
requirements.
and
this
of
course
is
exactly
the
point.
what
the
congress
decided
was
that
the
state
wanted
to
do
a
half
baked
job.
and
only
control
new
sources
or
perhaps
only
to
have
an
independent
inspection
system
not
related
to
any
substantive
requirements
whatsoever.
congress
was
not
to
let
the
states
do
that
to
federal
agencies
and
that
is
why
they
were
exempted.
they
wanted
to
encourage
the
states
to
take
over
the
whole
program.
this
is
the
point
of
the
entire
act.
so
a
state
can
have
a
program
for
new
sources
only.
it
can
have
an
inspection
program
only
but
without
having
a
full.
402
(b)
permit
system,
but
it
cannot
enforce
that
against
the
federal
government
because
epa
and
that
same
state
will
still
be
operating
a
permit
program
under
402
(a)
and
that
congress
did
not
want
this
kind
of
duplicatory
system.
but
once
the
state
took
its
responsibilities
under
402
(b)
then
federal
agencies
fall
within
it
because
under
the
expressed
terms
of
section
402
(b),
we
must
have
elements
of
a
new
source
program
under
306
and
an
inspection
and
monitoring
system
covered
by
section
308.
and
at
that
point
of
course
the
federal
agencies
must
secure
state
permits
as
well
as
abide
by
state
substantive
standards.
and
so
this
act
is
completely
consistent
throughout.
just
as
the
state
cannot
require
federal
agencies
to
abide
by
fragmented
states
program
and
to
create
a
dual
or
duplicatory
system
while
epa
is
still
issuing
permits
under
section
402
(a),
so
epa
cannot
create
a
dual
or
parallel
permit
program
like
harping
federal
agencies
out
of
the
state
permit
program
under
402
(b).
with
all
of
the
confusion
which
is
automatically
going
to
attend
upon
a
federal
permit
program
to
enforce
state
standards.
this
is
what
section
402
(c)
says,
it
said
what
section
313
says
and
is
what
they
mean.
and
the
very
case
which
the
solicitor
general
is
making
takes
him
right
out
of
court
himself
along
with
us.
thank
you.
