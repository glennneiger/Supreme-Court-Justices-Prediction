not
adult
theater,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
no
question
about
ambiguity
about
what
an
adult
theater
is
because
i
understand,
it
was
agreed
that
you
didn’t
let
minors
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
(inaudible)
did?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
impression
that
you
excluded
everyone
but
adults?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
ergo
is
an
adult
theater?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
a
theater
that
does
more
paying
customers.
if
they
exclude
paying
customers,
there
must
be
some
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
this
way,
is
in
fact
that
the
theater
itself
restricts
itself
to
minor
a
piece
of
evidence
that
can
be
considered
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
an
adult
theater?
