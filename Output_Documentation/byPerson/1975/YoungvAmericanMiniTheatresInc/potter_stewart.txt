the
category
of
regulated
uses
had
been
one
that
was
part
of
the
detroit
zoning
pattern
for
many
years,
hasn’t
it
been?
justice
potter
stewart
pool
halls
and
shoeshine
parlors
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
contrast
with
the
neighborhood
patronage?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
that
was
--
later
after
this,
after
this
judgment
--
after
the
district
court’s
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
court
of
appeals,
in
other
words,
a
fortiori
this,
the
other
one
would
be
invalidated
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
you
this
mrs.
reilly,
is
there
any
claim
or
any
showing
in
this
case
that
the
effect
of
this
zoning
ordinance
is
ultimately
to
limit
--
put
a
limit
on
the
absolute
number
of
these
theaters
and
bookstores
in
the
city
of
detroit?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
the
purpose
is
dispersal.
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
there
any
claim
that
the
effect
is
to,
actually
limit
the
number
of
them
in
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
right
but
my
question
was,
whether
the
effect
was
to
make
this
ordinance
tantamount
to
the
one
that
my
brother
rehnquist
hypothesized.
i
put
an
absolute
limit
on
the
number
of
these
two
kinds
of
establishments,
there
is
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
no.
i
know
there’s
no
ceiling
in
words
in
the
ordinance,
but
my
question
was
whether
the
--
there’s
any
claim
that
that
was
--
in
fact
what
the
ordinance
succeeded
in
doing.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
perhaps
it’s
going
to
be
made.
justice
potter
stewart
waived?
mrs.
reilly,
the
1000-foot
can’t
be
waived?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
both?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
reilly,
the
waiver
of
the
51%
waiver
provision,
does
that
apply
to
the
1000-foot
as
well
as
the
500
feet
residential.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
waivable?
justice
potter
stewart
--by
the
immediate
residents?
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
fact
it
could
--
that
waiver,
applies
to
what,
the
51%?
justice
potter
stewart
but
applicable
only
to
the
adult
business?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
definition
of
the
zoning
ordinance,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
the
--
i’m
looking
at
the
ordinance
on
page
81
of
this
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
page
beginning
on
page
80?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
doesn’t
say
anything
there
about
--
there
is
nothing
in
that
definition
or
that
definition
certainly
is
not
confined
to
a
theater
that
does
not
admit
minors
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
in
quite
different
language,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
theater
that
did
not
admit
minors
would
not
be
an
adult
theater
within
this
per
se,
under
this
ordinance,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
does
your
argument
go?
in
other
words,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
a
city
could
zone
a
portion
of
it’s
areas
as
residents
“a”
for
a
single
occupancy
residential
units
and
thereby
exclude
from
such
an
area,
grocery
stores,
pool
halls,
shoeshine
parlor,
parlors,
barbershops,
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
it
--
your
claim,
if
taken
to
its
logical
stream
would
be
that
it
could
not
exclude
from
such
an
area
any
bookstore?
justice
potter
stewart
or
movie
picture
theater?
justice
potter
stewart
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
traditional?
justice
potter
stewart
why
does
a
status
quo
have
to
be
frozen
terms
of
land
use
and
planning?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
isn’t
that
--
why
isn’t
that
a
violation
in
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
you
say
that
a
single
family
residential
zone
is
sustainable
if
it
excludes
pool
halls
and
theaters
from
it
for
example?
what’s
the
interest
that
supports
that?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
reilly,
i
have,
it
we
can
get
it
straight
on
page
86
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
there
is
that
whereas
beside
all
--
on
the
third
and
fourth
paragraphs.
it
said,
“whereas
adult
motion
pictures
theaters,
adult
mini
motion
picture
theaters,
adult
bookstores
and
group,
and
cabarets
are
not
permitted
in
b1,
b2,
or
b3
zone
districts,
and
are
only
permitted
with
the
approval
of
city
plan
commission
in
b4,
b5
and
b6.
i
take
it
in
what
you
say,
i
heard
that
no
theaters
are
permitted
in
b1,
b2,
and
b3?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
this
is
true
but
it’s
also
--
this
recital
is
true
but
it’s
also
true
of
all
theaters.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
court
today
holds
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
do
not
prevent
the
city
of
detroit,
michigan
from
using
a
system
of
prior
restrains
and
criminal
sanctions
to
enforce
restrictions
on
the
geographic
location
of
motion
picture
theaters
that
exhibit
certain
types
of
films.
i
dissent
from
this
what
i
consider
to
be
drastic
departure
from
established
principles
of
first
amendment
law
and
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
subscribed
to
the
written
dissent
i
have
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
this
case
does
not
involve
a
simple
zoning
ordinance
and
it
does
not
involve
a
regulation
of
obscene
expression
or
any
other
kind
of
speech
that
is
entitled
to
less
than
the
full
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
what
this
case
does
involve
is
the
constitutional
permissibility
of
selective
interference
with
protected
speech
whose
content
is
thought
to
produce
distasteful
effects.
it
is
elementary
that
a
prime
function
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
guard
against
exactly
that
kind
of
governmental
interference.
the
fact
that
the
offensive
speech
here
may
not
address
important
topics,
ideas
of
social
and
political
significance
in
the
court's
terminology,
does
not
mean
that
it
is
less
worthy
of
constitutional
protection.
wholly
neutral
futilities
come
under
the
protection
of
free
speech
as
fully
as
do
kieth's
(ph)
poems
of
john
don's
(ph)
sermons.
the
court
is
undoubtedly
sympathetic
as
i
am
to
the
well-intentioned
efforts
of
detroit
to
clean
up
it's
streets
and
prevent
the
proliferation
of
skid
rows.
but
it
is
in
those
instances
where
a
protected
speech
rates
most
unpleasantly
against
the
sensibilities
that
judicial
vigilance
must
be
at
it's
height.
the
court
must
never
forget
that
the
consequences
of
rigorously
enforcing
the
guarantees
of
the
first
amendment
are
frequently
unpleasant.
much
speech
that
seems
to
be
of
little
or
no
value
will
enter
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
threatening
the
quality
of
our
social
discourse
and
more
generally
the
serenity
of
our
lives,
but
that
is
the
price
to
be
paid
for
constitutional
freedom.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
today
in
this
case
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshal
and
i
have
joined.
