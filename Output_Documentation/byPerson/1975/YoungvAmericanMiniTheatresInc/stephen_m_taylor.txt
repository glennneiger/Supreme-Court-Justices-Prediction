mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
ordinance
in
question,
the
ordinance
before
the
court
is
a
zoning
ordinance.
at
least
it
is
termed
that
whatever
the
label
given
to
a
regulation
whether
it
be
zoning,
whether
it
be
licensing,
the
regulation
is
subject
to
strict
standards
of
judicial
scrutiny
where
it
impinges
upon
a
fundamental
right.
now,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
zoning
ordinance
here
impinges
upon
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
for
that
reason,
we
have
attacked
that
the
ordinance
had
a
number
of
grounds
and
if
i
might
turn
to
the
question,
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
powell
directed
with
regard
to
the
question
of
vagueness.
if
we
may
look
at
the
ordinance
for
a
second,
the
questions
of
vagueness
arises
in
three
contexts.
first
with
regard
to
the
definition
of
the
materials
per
se
so
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
the
question
of
vagueness,
your
honor?
i
don’t
believe
it
was
raised
but
the
court
didn’t
decide
on
that
issue.
however
this
court
can
look
at
it,
all
of
the
various
issues
independently
and
make
its
own
determination.
and
that
is
the
reason
that
we
have
raised
it
continually
through
the
court.
however,
getting
back
to
the
point
of
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
lower
court.
i
don’t
believe
however
that
it
was
decided
on
the
issue
and
it
clearly
was
not
decided
on
that
issue
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
was
decided
on
equal
protection
basis.
now
again,
with
regard
to
the
definitions
of
an
adult
bookstore
per
se,
the
term
is
defined
as
a
bookstore
having
a
substantial
or
significant
portion
of
its
stock
in
trade
what
is
substantial
or
significant
portion,
how
does
one
measure
that
kind
of
term
if
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
well,
of
course
we’re
dealing
with
an
adult
theater
but
assuming
that
we
were
talking
about
an
adult
bookstore,
yes,
it
probably
would
identify
itself
as
an
adult
bookstore.
however,
taking
the
ordinances
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
your
honor,
i
would
beg
to
differ
with
you
on
this
basis
taking
the
definition
as
it
stands
that
could
apply
to
virtually
to
any
kind
of
a
bookstore
selling
any
kind
of
a
material
because
we
don’t
know
where
the
line
is
to
be
drawn.
that
is
to
say,
if
in
the
area
of
first
amendment
rights,
precision
of
regulation
is
a
touchstone,
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
at
what
point
a
bookstore
passes
that
line
from
adult
to
non-adult.
so,
though
it
may
be
true,
some
bookstores
advertised
themselves
as
adult
bookstores
as
that
term
is
used,
whatever
that
term
means
this
nevertheless
could
apply
potentially
to
any
kind
of
a
bookstore.
on
the
same
basis,
if
we
take
a
look
at
the
definition
of
a
motion
picture
theater
and
enclosed
building
used
for
presenting
material,
well,
that
doesn’t
tell
us
whether
as
one
film
for
two
hours,
it
doesn’t
tell
us
whether
that
is
one
film
for
one
week
or
for
six
weeks,
or
six
films
for
shall
we
say
two
weeks
a
piece.
in
other
words,
again
we
have
the
same
problem.
we
don’t
know
at
what
point
that
line
is
drawn.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
pardon?
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
but
on
the
same
basis
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
if
that
be
the
basis
that
the
city
stands
and
we
don’t
know
that,
then
we
can
simply
say
that
any
r-rated
film
as
rated
by
motion
pictures
association
would
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that
would
be
correct
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that
is
correct
as
in
so
far
as
the
nortown
theatre
goes,
that
would
be
correct.
however
again
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
pardon?
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes,
your
honor.
would
you
mind
if
i
direct
you
to
page
to
66?
if
that
is
the
appendix
or
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
i
believe
that’s
a
different
ordinance
your
honor.
80?
that
is
the
licensing
ordinance
for
adult
theaters.
same
definition,
that
would
be
correct,
right.
used
for
presenting
material.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that’s
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that’s
the
point
we
don’t
know
at
what
point
a
theater
becomes
an
adult
theater
in
accordance
with
this
definition.
now,
if
might
turn
to
the
definition
of
the
material
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
your
honor,
we
don’t
know,
that’s
the
problem.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that’s
correct.
it
doesn’t
define
it
in
those
terms.
that
would
be
correct.
it
doesn’t
say
that
a
theater
which
does
not
admit
minors
thereby
is
an
adult
theater,
if
that’s
what
your
honor
is
getting
at,
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that
may
be
true
your
honor.
possibly
because
the
material
is
not
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
again,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
because
there
are
many
theaters
which
based
upon
a
particular
movie
which
would
come
to
that
particular
theater
at
a
particular
time
would
exclude
minors
and
we
don’t
know
whether
that
theatre
then
would
be
an
adult
theater.
now
if
i
might
turn
to
the
definition
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
no,
your
honor.
we
are
claiming
that
it
is
vague
as
applied
to
my
client,
if
not
in
this
context,
then
in
another
context
which
i
was
just
getting
to.
and
also
not
only
as
applied
that
is
written,
not
only
to
this
particular
theater
but
to
all
theaters
similarly
situate.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
again,
we
have
stipulated
(voice
overlap)
that
we
do
show
materials
of
sexual
in
nature,
so
if
that
be
the
definition,
which
is
what
we
will
get
into
in
a
moment,
yes.
this
ordinance
then
would
apply
to
the
nortown
theatre.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
i
am
also
asserting
that
it’s
vague
both
as
to
apply
to
my
client
and
to
other
uses.
now,
if
i
might
get
into
the
next
point,
the
ordinance
defines
the
term,
the
material,
as
material
distinguished
or
characterized
by
an
emphasis
on
the
matter
and
then
goes
into
the
definition
of
the
particular
matter.
what
i
point
out
to
the
court,
again,
we
have
the
same
problem.
we
don’t
know
at
what
point
the
material
is
distinguished
or
characterized
by
an
emphasis
upon.
what
specifically
or
what
does
that
mean?
how
much
of
the
material?
what
percentage
of
the
material
has
to
be
of
a
sexual
nature
and
anatomical
content
if
you
like
before
it
passes
that
line
between
non-adult
and
adult?
so
then
we
have
again,
the
same
problem
with
vagueness.
now,
if
i
might
turn
to
the
next
position
that
we’ve
taken
and
that
is
on
a
question
or
overbreadth.
now,
as
we
have
said,
it’s
our
position
that
the
ordinance
is
vague
as
far
as
those
definitions
go,
but
might
i
point
out
the
court
with
regard
to
the
definition
as
to
specific
sexual
conduct
or
specific
anatomical
area
that
this
ordinance
applies
to,
it
is
quite
specific.
however,
it
defines
that
material
in
those,
in
that
context
in
a
way
which
clearly,
it
goes
beyond
the
restraints
on
expression,
that
is
to
say
an
obscenity.
the
ordinance
we
far
beyond
permissible
restraints
on
obscenity,
and
this
is
conceded
by
the
petitioners
in
this
matter.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
not
only
does
it
go
beyond
permissible
restraints
on
obscenity,
but
it
differentiates
between
materials
which
are,
between
protective
materials
which
are
adults
and
which
are
not
adult.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
your
honor
i
think
that
would
depend
upon
the
interest
asserted
by
the
city
of
detroit.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
my
answer
to
the
court
would
be
no,
based
upon
the
definition
laid
out
here
by
this
ordinance
and
the
way
this
ordinance
is
written.
i
would
suppose,
and
i
have
to
speak
to
your
honor
of
the
top
of
my
head
in
the
sense
that
that
is
not
the
question
that’s
before
the
court.
it
may
be
possible
for
the
city
to
do
exactly
what
your
honor
is
saying.
but
they
can’t
do
it
in
this
way
and
that
is
not
the
intent
of
this
ordinance
or
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
this
ordinance.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes
sir,
you’re
right.
i
understand
the
hypothetical
question
and
i
think
the
city
would
have
a
difficult
time
justifying
that
kind
of
an
ordinance
unless
there
was
some
indication
of
an
actual
thrusting
or
viewing
upon
children.
in
other
words,
some
indication
that
there
was
some
of
the
material
reaching
the
children,
simply
to
say
which
in
essence
is
exactly
what
the
city
is
saying.
this
i
think
is
where
one
of
the
basic
questions
of
the
essence
--
the
question
of
overbreadth,
the
question
of
justification,
the
interest
asserted
by
the
city.
what
are
those
interests
that
the
city
asserts?
the
city
asserts
in
interests
in
protecting
its
neighborhoods
and
preserving
its
--
the
values
if
you
like,
community
living,
all
of
which
simply
asserted
in
the
abstract
are
fine.
and
there
is,
without
a
doubt
an
interest
and
the
city
has
a
valid
interest
in
that.
but
let’s
take
a
look
for
a
moment
if
we
can
from
the
abstraction
of
the
interest
to
the
concrete
basis
for
the
interests.
the
city
of
detroit
has
said
as
a
basis
and
has
filed
many
affidavits
by
a
professor.
they
have
said
that
there
are
certain
characteristics
which
because
of
their
very
nature
cause
serious
deleterious
effects.
yet,
they
never
mentioned
what
those
specific
effects
are.
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court,
this
ordinance
takes
effect
that
the
inception
of
the
operation
of
the
theater
or
the
bookstore,
that
is
to
say,
there
is
no
theater
or
bookstore
showing
adult
materials,
they
have
to
request
--
a
bookstore
or
theater
has
to
request
a
waiver
in
essence
in
the
case
of
the
nortown,
a
waiver
of
the
standards
in
order
to
operate
as
an
adult
theater.
the
city
of
detroit
said
that
there
are
certain
interests,
there
is
a
basis
for
this
interest
and
they
submit
affidavits
upon
which
they
base
their
interests.
and
if
we
looked
at
the
affidavits,
what
they
really
say
is,
the
people
object
to
the
materials
coming
into
their
area.
they
have
a
concept
in
their
minds,
a
pre-existing
notion
in
their
minds,
if
you
like,
that
they
don’t
like
the
material
because
they
don’t
like
it,
they
view
the
area
as
going
down
they
thereby
sell
their
property
or
they
don’t
take
care
of
their
property.
the
property
goes
down
and
brings
another
people
and
don’t
keep
it
up.
now
this
is
no
more
than
what
this
court
has
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
your
honor,
on
the
contrary,
there
is
an
affidavit
submitted
by,
i
believe
it’s
mr.
ravitz
who’s
a
professor
which
is
the
basis
of
the
ordinances
--
this
is
the
basis.
this
is
what
the
city
says.
we
based
our
ordinance
on
this.
and
what
does
that
ordinance
say?
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
in
his
affidavit
he
said
specifically
that
whether
it’s
true
or
not,
that
the
property
is
going
down,
people
will
act
as
if
it’s
going
down,
as
if
there
is
an
effect
upon
in
the
neighborhood
which
is
deleterious.
and
therefore,
since
they
will
act,
then
that
will
be
in
fact
the
truth.
and
this
is
the
point
which
we’re
making
to
the
court.
all
that
the
city
is
saying
on
this
record
is
that
what
this
court
has
called
an
undifferentiated
fear
or
apprehension
of
harm
at
sometime
in
the
future
as
a
basis
for
these
ordinances,
what
the
city
is
doing.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
there
is
virtually
no
reason,
no
basis,
no
rationale.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that
is
my
understanding
and
is
my
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
other
theaters
are
not
permitted
in
b1,
2
and
3.
and
adult
business
and
adult
theaters
are
not
permitted
in
b3,
4,
5
and
6
though
other
theaters
are.
so
there
is
of
difference
based
upon
the
kind
of
the
material
intended
to
be
disseminated.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
no,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
our
theater
or
any
theater
or
bookstore
should
be
treated
no
differently
than
in
any
other
theater
or
bookstore.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
there
may
be
a
difference
there
your
honor,
but
the
difference
is
that
a
pool
hall
is
not
in
of
itself
protected,
for
instance
the
theaters,
i
might
have
point
to
the
court
that
you
can’t
show
a
film
without
a
motion
picture
theater.
if
you
stop
the
operation
of
the
theater,
you
stop
the
operation
--
you
stop
the
showing,
not
only
of
a
particular
film,
but
virtually
all
films
which
will
be
shown
at
that
theater.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
the
city
may
be
able
to
do
that
but
would
have
to
come
up
with
a
concrete
justification
which
would
be
i
might
have
more
than
merely
that
the
city
doesn’t
like
the
people
who
come
to
the
theater
because
they
assume
something
is
going
on
the
theater,
which
is
exactly
what
counsel
has
come
up
with,
recently,
just
now,
in
this
interest.
they
assume
that
the
people
are
sexually
excited
and
therefore,
to
say
this
kind
of
thing
we
don’t
want
in
our
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
your
honor,
one,
there
has
been
no
independent
evidence,
no
showing
that
adult
bookstores
and
adult
theaters,
in
and
of
themselves
causes
problems.
there
is
virtually
nothing
on
the
record.
moreover,
what
the
city
has
said
is
that,
there
are
massage
parlors
which
caused
these
problems.
as
the
city
has
just
said,
yet
you
will
note
that
massage
parlors
are
not
included
in
the
regulated
uses.
so,
there
is
something
other
than
prostitution
which
is
involved.
yes,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes
your
honor,
as
i
understand
that
there
is
no
question
that
raised
by
the
city
that
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
we,
by
way
i
referred
to
my
client’s
theater
your
honor
is
apparently
within
a
1000
feet
of
two
other
regulated
uses.
the
record
does
not
disclose
whether
or
not
--
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
apparently,
the
one
that
has
to
go
out
of
business
is
the
third
one.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
yes,
your
honor.
that
apparently
is
us.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
no.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
unlike
the
theater
owned
by
nortown,
respondent
nortown,
we
had
not
been
an
operational
theater
prior
to
the
time
of
the
promulgation
of
the
amended
ordinance.
nortown
apparently
had
been
a
theater
for
some
40
years
and
then
changed
policy
subsequent
to
the
ordinance
being
passed.
we
were
incipient
theater,
if
the
court
will,
having
passed
all
of
the
preliminary
test
and
then
the
ordinance
was
promulgated
and
we
were
denied
the
certificate
of
occupancy.
mr.
stephen
m.
taylor
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
neither
of
the
theaters
involved
in
this
case
is
in
such
a
generally
outlawed
zoning
area.
so,
it’s
simply
a
