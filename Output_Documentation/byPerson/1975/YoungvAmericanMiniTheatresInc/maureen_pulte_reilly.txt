ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
for
the
record,
i
am
maureen
reilly,
assistant
corporation
counsel
for
the
city
of
detroit,
representing
coleman
a.
young,
mayor
of
detroit,
and
the
department
heads
who
petitioners
in
this
matter.
the
court
is
asked
this
morning
to
review
a
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
by
two
to
one
decision
invalidated
amendments
to
the
city’s
zoning
and
licensing
laws
regulating
adult
businesses.
this
case
is
now
before
the
court
approximately
eight
years
after
the
first
--
the
problem
first
became
apparent
in
the
city
of
detroit.
in
1969,
there
were
only
two
of
these
new
uses,
land
uses
within
the
city
--
two
adult
bookstores,
two
adult
theaters
and
relatively
few
topless
go-go
bars.
within
a
period
of
three
years,
that
number
had
changed
so
that
there
were
18
adult
theaters,
21
adult
bookstores
and
70
topless
bars.
reports
from
the
detroit
police
department
indicated
that
these
businesses
had
clustered
together
along
the
main
arteries
of
the
city
of
detroit
and
were
immediately
adjacent
to
or
backed
up
to
neighborhoods,
residential
neighborhoods
which
were
zoned
residential.
based
on
the
complaints
received
by
a
number
of
families,
residents
and
businessmen
whose
businesses
served
those
families,
the
mayor
recommended
changes
in
the
city’s
zoning
and
licensing
laws.
the
changes
that
were
adopted
were
these:
the
adult
businesses
were
now
designated
as
regulated
uses.
these
were
uses
which
had
been
determined
by
the
council
to
be
businesses,
which
had
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
surrounding
neighborhood,
which
caused
a
downgrading
in
property
values
and
the
deterioration
of
the
neighborhood
generally.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor.
the
idea,
the
concept
of
regulated
uses
so
far
as
i
know
was
a
new
concept
of
inverse
zoning
adopted
by
the
city
in
1962.
the
city
found
out
that
certain
uses
when
clustered
together
caused
the
downgrading
of
a
neighborhood.
the
uses
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
motels,
bars,
those
businesses
which
cater
to
transient-
type
patrons
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that’s
right,
your
honor.
it
seemed
only
proper
that
the
adult
businesses
be
included
in
the
regulated
use
category
because
they
follow
the
same
pattern.
they
cluster
together,
they
drew
patrons
who
are
not
members
of
the
immediate
neighborhood
but
from
the
surrounding
community
and
had
operational
characteristics
which
set
them
apart
from
other
types
of
theaters
and
bookstores.
these
theaters
and
bookstores
which
offered
a
substantial
portion
of
their
stock
and
trade
or
they
films
were
sexually
stimulating
on
the
spot.
it
was
not
like
a
drugstore
that
would
offer
pill
and
you
go
home
and
five
hours
later
you
feel
sexually
stimulated,
whether
you
walked
in
to
the
theater,
and
watched
the
film
on
the
screen
or
you
walked
in
to
the
bookstore
and
review
the
material
there,
the
immediate
reaction
was
sexual
stimulation.
i
think
this
court
can
almost
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
when
these
persons
left
the
store
not
only
the
residents
were
aware
of
how
they
may
have
been
sexually
stimulated
but
prostitutes
were
aware
of
it.
and
prostitutes
began
coming
into
these
areas.
it’s
a
matter
of
record
in
the
city
of
detroit
that
in
these
areas
where
the
adult
businesses
clustered,
so-called
massage
parlors
opened.
we
have
padlocked
12
massage
parlors
within
the
last
few
years,
all
of
them
in
the
area
of
the
adult
businesses.
i
called
the
massage
parlors
but
in
fact
they
were
fronts
for
houses
of
prostitution.
this
is
one
of
the
adverse
effects
which
is
caused
by
the
adult
businesses
particularly
when
they
cluster
together.
and
this
is
one
of
the
adverse
effects
that
the
families
are
concerned
about
when
they
send
the
women
and
the
children
and
some
of
the
men
who
are
concerned
to
the
business
area
which
includes
these
adult
businesses.
in
1972,
when
we
passed
the
ordinances,
there
was
no
immediate
reaction.
the
people
generally
seemed
to
favor
the
ordinances.
early
in
1973,
we
had
our
first
test
of
the
ordinances.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
american
mini
theatres
inc.
and
nortown
theatre
inc.
both
opened
adult
theaters
in
the
city
of
detroit
in
violation
of
the
city’s
zoning
regulations.
both
were
within
1000
feet
of
two
other
regulated
uses.
in
fact,
the
nortown
was
within
1000
feet,
of
i
believe,
seven
other
regulated
uses;
neither
adult
business,
the
respondents
--
neither
of
the
respondents
sought
to
obtain
a
waiver
by
the
neighboring
community.
now
i
recognize
that
the
provision
in
the
ordinance,
in
the
zoning
ordinance
requiring
the
consent
of
51%
of
the
persons
living
or
doing
business
within
500
feet
of
the
location
of
the
adult
business
is
not
directly
before
the
court
today.
but
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
indirectly,
the
provision
is
before
the
court.
if
this
court
accepts
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
the
city
may
not
regulate
adult
businesses,
because
by
definition,
it
refers
to
the
content
of
the
material
disseminated
therein,
then
all
of
the
city’s
regulations
dealing
with
adult
businesses
will
be
wiped
out.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
we
took
no
appeal,
your
honor.
we
amended
the
ordinance
to
correct
the
deficiency,
pouring
it
out
by
the
trial
court.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
when
i
say
that
that
provision
is
indirectly
before
the
court,
i
say
that
because
it
includes
the
same
definition
and
would
be
wiped
out,
if
the
court
refuse
to
allow
the
provision
that
is
directly
before
the
court
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that
is
correct
your
honor,
the
other
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
this
provision
was
needed
by
council
and
considered
by
council
because
it
took
into
consideration
the
aspect
of
protecting
the
families,
the
youth
in
the
neighborhood.
and
that’s
why
i
ask
this
court
not
to
ignore
it
because
the
package
was
presented
to
council
as
one
package
to
accomplish
two
ends,
two
avoid
clustering
in
the
neighborhoods
in
the
business
area
that
served
the
neighborhood,
and
to
ensure
the
businessman
in
the
zoned
business
district
and
the
residents
that
they
would
continue
to
have
a
voice
in
the
kind
of
neighborhood
that
they
lived
in,
and
to
ensure
their
commitment
to
the
neighborhood.
and
this
provision,
the
51
consent
provision
has
to
be
at
least
considered
by
the
court
in
the
total
picture
that
we’re
trying
to
present
to
the
court
today.
the
respondents
in
this
matter,
the
two
adult
theaters,
who
by
the
way
admit
that
they
are
adult
theaters
in
their
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
state
unequivocally
that
no
minor
were
permitted,
brought
the
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
contending
that
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
were
being
violated.
i’m
sure
this
court
is
aware
that
the
district
court
reversed
the
rule
that
provision
relating
to
the
51%
consent
was
ruled
unconstitutional
because
the
court
said
it
was
too
restrictive
to
accomplish
the
legitimate
interest
sought
to
be
accomplished
by
the
city.
the
reason
being
that
the
ordinance
dealt
with
a
particular
residential
unit
when
the
court
said,
we
had
shown
that
we
were
attempting
to
protect
the
neighborhood
and
obviously
a
single
residential
unit
is
not
a
neighborhood.
so
that
ordinance
was
stricken
because
it
was
more
restrictive
that
necessary
to
accomplish
our
purpose.
the
other
provision
of
the
zoning
law
relating
to
the
1000-foot
restriction
was
upheld
as
being
a
legitimate
way
of
protecting
the
city’s
interest,
in
allowing
the
neighborhoods
to
remain
stable
and
to
protect
them
in
providing
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
neighborhood
and
the
business
people
would
continue
to
live
in
the
neighborhood
and
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
if
i
understand
you
correctly
your
honor,
you
are
asking
that
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
correct.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that’s
correct.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes
your
honor,
there
is
the
waiver.
both
provisions
may
be
waived.
the
1000-foot
provision
may
be
waived
by
the
--
what
was
the
city
planning
commission
under
our
new
organization.
it’s
a
different
department,
by
the
waiver
still
is
allowed.
and
the
51%
consent
waiver
is
still
continued
under
the
500-foot
restriction.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
well
at
least
it
was
ayrie
[laughter]
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
i
would
have
to
characterize
it
as
a
first
amendment
case
because
of
the
issues
raised.
it
is
the
petitioners’
position
however
that
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
o’brien
would
be
controlling
and
we
are
asking
this
court
not
to
apply
an
absolutist
viewpoint
on
first
amendment
rights
to
this
case.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor,
it’s
our
position
that
even
though
we
look
to
the
content
of
the
material
to
define
the
type
of
business,
which
is
causing
the
deleterious
effects,
the
regulations
are
not
directed
toward
the
content
of
the
material.
they
are
directed
towards
the
location
of
commercial
operations
in
order
to
avoid
clustering
and
the
adverse
effects
which
results
from
a
clustering
and
to
avoid
locating
these
kinds
of
businesses
in
neighborhoods
where
we
are
concerned
about
family
values.
so,
in
this
sense,
i’m
saying,
yes
first
amendment
must
be
considered.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
it’s
a
simple
matter
of
going
to
the
community
and
economic
development
department
in
the
city
of
detroit.
and
filing
an
application
or
stating
where
he
wishes
to
locate
and
he
will
be
advised
by
that
department
of
any
other
regulated
uses
within
1000
feet
of
the
proposed
location.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
your
honor,
the
class
“d”
cabarets
are
licensed
both
by
the
state
and
by
the
city.
motion
pictures
theaters
have
traditionally
been
licensed
within
the
city
of
detroit
and
adult
theaters
are
subject
to
the
same
licensing
provisions
as
the
non-adult
theaters.
bookstores
have
not
traditionally
been
licensed
in
the
city
and
the
adult
bookstores
are
not
licensed,
so
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
no,
the
bookstore,
like
any
other
commercial
operation
must
have
a
certificate
of
occupancy
which
is
required
in
order
to
check
out
the
health
regulations.
going
back
to
one
of
the
points
raised
by
one
of
the
justices,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
first
amendment
rights,
if
this
is
a
first
amendment
case,
i
say
yes,
but
i
am
asking
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
that
this
court
apply
the
traditional
balancing
of
interest
test
to
the
case
at
the
bar.
in
many
cases
decided
by
this
court
recently,
the
court
has
looked
to
the
content
of
the
material.
i
get
the
impression
from
the
fort
dix
case
that
was
announced
today,
that
the
court
said,
it
is
political
material,
but
under
the
circumstances
considering
the
interest
of
the
state
in
protecting
the
military
atmosphere
in
a
camp
devoted
entirely
to
military
purposes
and
balancing
that
with
the
interest
of
the
person
who
seek
to
disseminate
their
political
views.
the
balancing
results
in
a
favorable
position
on
behalf
of
the
state,
that
the
state’s
interest
is
more
important
under
this
situation.
this
balancing
of
interest
has
been
applied
in
the
ginsberg
versus
new
york
case
where
the
court
said,
“material
may
not
be
obscene
as
to
adults
but
may
be
regulated
as
to
minors,”
specific
material
dealing
with
sexual
conduct
if
appealing
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
minors,
it
may
be
separated
and
regulated,
even
though
it
is
not
obscene
and
cannot
be
totally
prohibited.
the
material
which
we
are
discussing
in
the
case
at
bar
in
specifically
defined
and
relates
to
specific
sexual
conduct.
the
definitions
are
quite
explicit.
in
fact,
when
the
ordinance
was
presented
to
city
council,
our
council
president
asked,
if
it
was
permissible
to
discuss
it
at
the
table
considering
our
anti-pornography
ordinances.
we
are
dealing
with
a
definition
including
specific
sexual
conduct
and
specific
sexual
areas
of
the
body,
not
general
ideas
relating
to
feelings,
political,
social,
economic,
so
on.
the
definitions
are
clearly
tied
into
specific
sexual
conduct
in
anatomical
areas.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that
is
correct,
your
honor
we
are
not
implying
that
the
material
is
obscene
because
we
recognize
this
court’s
decision
that
no
material
is
technically
pornographic
until
it
has
been
found
to
be
so
by
a
judicial
adversary
hearing.
the
problem
is,
that
there
is
a
great
amount
of
material
which
may
or
may
not
be
obscene,
which
maybe
hard
core,
soft
core
or
whatever,
but
it
is
all
sexually
stimulating
and
it
all
--
if
that
type
of
material
is
offered
in
a
business
we
have
the
adverse
effects
existing
from
these
types
of
businesses
whether
or
not
the
material
is
determined
to
be
obscene
legally.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that’s
the
key
to
this
case
that
we
are
not
saying
the
material
itself
is
offensive.
we
are
saying
that
the
operation
of
these
types
of
businesses
causes
adverse
effects
which
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
the
neighboring
citizens
whether
they
be
residents
or
businessmen.
if
we
said
only
the
material
is
offensive,
we
would
have
no
right
to
prohibit
the
sale
or
dissemination
of
that
material
without
a
judicial
adversary
hearing
because
this
court
in
miller
rule
that
only
obscene
material
may
be
directly
prohibited,
and
then
only
after
a
judicial
adversary
hearing.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
no
your
honor
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
i
do
not
recall
that
that
claim
has
been
made
at
any
time.
the
claim
has
been
made
that
we
don’t
know
where
to
locate
and
i
said
at
the
district
court
level,
i
wasn’t
about
to
point
out
the
places
where
they
might
locate.
but
the
zoning
law
is
written
in
such
a
way
that
they
may
locate
anywhere
where
similar
uses
may
locate
in
business
zoned
districts
if
they’re
not
within
a
thousand
feet
of
two
other
regulated
uses.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
there
is
no
absolute
limit.
no
sealing
on
the
number
of
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
i
do
not
believe
that
claim
was
made
at
any
point.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
it
may
be
made
now,
that’s
why
i
was
carefully
answering
that.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes?
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
way,
all
the
regulated
uses
are
subject
to
the
1000-foot
restriction.
public
entertainments,
many
of
the
public
entertainments
in
the
city
of
detroit
are
also
subject
to
the
500-foot
restriction.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
in
terms
of
location,
no,
except
that
i
have
to
point
out
that
the
adult
businesses
are
now
subject
our
amended
ordinance
to
the
51%
consent
provision
that
the
adult
businesses
may
not
locate
within
500
feet
of
a
residentially
zoned
district.
the
other
regulated
uses
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
no,
well
--
you’re
asking
if
they’re
being
treated
the
same.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
and
i’m
saying
the
barrens
under
a
different
law
are
also
subject
to
that
1000-foot
provision.
i’m
sorry
the
51%
consent
provision.
all
the
regulated
uses
are
subject
to
the
1000-foot
provision.
the
additional
requirement
that
they
not
locate
within
500
feet
of
a
residentially-zoned
district
applies
only
to
bars
and
the
adult
businesses
with
the
regulated
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
it
can
be
waived.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
by
the
successor
the
city
planning
commission
upon
the
showing
of
certain
facts
basically
that
it
will
not
adversely
affect
the
neighborhood.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
no.
let
me
briefly
explain
it
to
clarify
it.
the
amendments
to
the
zoning
ordinance
involved
two
provisions
relating
to
adult
businesses.
the
adult
businesses
were
categorized
as
regulated
uses.
all
regulated
uses
are
subject
to
the
1000-foot
provision.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that
is
it
may
be
waived
by
the
city
planning
commission
upon
us
showing
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
no,
that
is
a
separate
restriction
which
only
applies
to
bars,
adult
businesses
which
we
consider
to
be
entertainment
and
certain
other
types
of
entertainment
in
the
city.
those
are
listed
in
section
5-2-1
in
ordinance
743
(g).
so,
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
the
51%
consent
of
the
surrounding
neighborhood
applies
to
the
500-foot
restriction
that
an
adult
business
may
not
locate
within
500
feet
(voice
overlap).
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
adult
businesses,
bars
and
certain
public
entertainments
listed
in
section
5-2-1.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
i
believe
theaters
may
be
permitted
in
b3
zones
and
those
zones
have
become
less
restrictive,
the
b4,
b5
and
b6.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
within
the
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
or
even
i
flew
over
the
cuckoo
nest.
it
is
only
those
that
come
within
our
specific
definition.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
all
moving
pictures
theaters
are
licensed,
yes.
all
licensed
in
the
same
way,
the
same
kind
of
restrictions.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
it
is
very
definitely
directed
to
preserve
property
vales.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
provide
a
suitable
atmosphere
for
the
raising
of
children,
yes.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that’s
correct
your
honor,
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
--
i’m
sorry.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
well,
of
course
it’s
our
position
that
the
ordinances
are
quite
specific.
we
have
had
to
use
relative
terms
in
the
definition
of
the
bookstores
because
it’s
extremely
difficult
to
say
if
a
store
has
89%
of
its
stock
in
trade
to
be
adult,
but
that
makes
it
adult,
i’m
sorry,
that
does
not
make
it
adult
but
90%
would
make
it
adult.
so
we
used
a
relative
term
substantial,
that
word
has
been
used
time
and
again
by
this
court.
in
fact,
i
think
it’s
used
in
u.s.
versus
o’brien
talking
about
substantial
or
compelling
governmental
interests.
even
though
the
term
is
relative,
it
is
not
vague.
this
court
has
looked
at
many
relative
terms
at
or
near
a
courthouse,
interfere
with
the
administration
of
justice,
or
such
as
that
were
discussed
in
cameron
versus
louisiana
--
the
cameron
case,
cox
versus
louisiana.
and
this
court
has
said
that
you
cannot
always
have
mathematical
certainty.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
well,
the
department
which
now
controls
the
zoning
ordinances,
the
community
and
economic
development
administration
would
make
that
determination.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
your
honor,
under
our
michigan
court
rules,
a
person
may
go
into
court
and
within
four
days,
have
a
decision
of
an
administrative
body
reviewed
and
if
there’s
not
substantial
evidence,
again,
the
words
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
to
support
that
determination,
the
court
may
interfere
with
the
administrative
decision
and
overturn
it.
there
is
a
review
body.
our
board
of
zoning
appeals
reviews
all
decisions
that
are
protested
which
are
made
by
the
community
and
economic
development
department.
so
there
is
an
in-house
review
available
in
the
administration
of
the
city
and
there
is
court
review
available
on
four-days
notice.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
under
the
zoning
law,
if
a
use,
say
an
adult
use
and
then
seizes
to
be
in
an
adults
use
for
six
months,
then
it
ceases
to
have
the
restrictions
upon
it
or
the
benefits
if
it’s
a
non-conforming
adult
use
say,
which
was
existing
before
our
ordinance
and
it
closed
down
for
six
months
or
changed
it’s
fair
for
six
months,
then
it
would
no
longer
be
considered
an
adult
use
and
no
longer
be
considered
a
non-conforming
use.
and
if
then
wished
to
become
an
adult
business,
it
would
have
to
go
through
whatever
the
rules
are
applicable
to
starting
a
brand
new
business.
there
is
a
six-month
time
period
on
it.
i’d
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
thank
you
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
take
the
remaining
moments
to
respond
to
some
of
the
comments
made
by
counsel
for
respondents.
in
response
to
one
of
the
questions
by
one
of
the
justices,
i
was
given
the
impression
and
i’m
fearful
maybe
some
of
the
judges
were
that
--
the
adult
businesses
may
not
locate
in
the
same
business
districts
as
other
non-adult
businesses
of
the
similar
type.
that
is
not
so,
the
adult
theaters
may
locate
in
zones
b4,
b5,
and
b6,
just
as
a
non-adult
theater
may
locate
on
those
zones
unless
they
are
faced
with
the
restrictions,
the
1000-foot
restriction
or
the
500-foot
restriction.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that
is
correct,
yes.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
two
regulated
uses
which
included
other
than
the
adult
businesses.
the
second
point
is
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
only
if
it’s
subject
to
the
two
restrictions
that
i
mentioned
the
1000-foot
or
the
500-foot.
otherwise,
are
treated
the
same
as
a
regular
theater.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
the
point
has
also
been
raised
by
counsel
in
oral
argument
and
in
his
brief
that
we
did
not
zone
massage
parlors.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
rather
obvious.
massage
parlors
are
legitimate
business
operations
as
our
health
clubs,
spas
and
so
on.
it
is
only
when
they’re
fronts
for
prostitution
that
they
create
a
problem
and
we
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
massage
parlors
--
the
legitimate
massage
parlors
have
not
created
the
problem
that
pool
halls,
bars
and
so
on
have
created.
it’s
only
those
massage
parlors
which
are
fronting
as
houses
of
prostitution
which
have
created
the
problem
and
clearly
we
do
not
intend
to
zone
them.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
we
padlocked
them
and
put
them
out
of
business
entirely.
one
of
the
justices
raised
the
question
whether
it
would
be
feasible
to
limit
all
theaters
under
the
500-foot
and
the
1000-foot
restriction.
our
problem
with
that
is,
that
we
feel
that
if
we
did
that,
then
the
non-adult
theaters
would
claim
that
the
ordinance
applied
to
them
was
over
broad
because
there
are
no
adverse
effects
from
their
operation.
therefore,
they
should
not
be
restricted.
they
would
claim
first
amendment
rights
and
claim
that
the
city’s
ordinance
unnecessarily
restricted
their
location
and
their
operation
and
so
we
have
not
included
all
theaters.
we
won’t
include
it
under
the
ordinances
only
those
theaters
which
have
been
shown
to
cause
deleterious
effects
in
the
neighborhood.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
theater
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
if
it
creates
a
nuisance
in
the
neighborhood,
then
the
nuisance
maybe
enjoined.
whatever
the
operational
effects
caused
by
the
large
theater
are,
then
the
city
might
go
into
court
and
ask
that
those
operational
effects
as
to
congestion
of
traffic
and
so
on
be
enjoined
as
to
that
specific
theater
and
those
specific
operational
characteristics.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
no
your
honor,
that
relates
to
a
specific
nuisance
problem.
there
is
a
law
in
the
city
of
detroit
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
(voice
overlap)
and
the
parking
problem
is
treated
by
ordinance
in
the
city.
there
are
requirements
as
to
the
number
of
parking
spaces
which
must
be
made
available
for
a
theater
having
a
certain
number
of
seats.
but
that
applies
to
all
theaters
regardless
of
the
content.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
yes,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
--
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
pulte
reilly
that’s
correct.
it
did
not
go
far
enough
to
explain
that
it
does
include
all
theaters.
thank
you,
our
honors.
