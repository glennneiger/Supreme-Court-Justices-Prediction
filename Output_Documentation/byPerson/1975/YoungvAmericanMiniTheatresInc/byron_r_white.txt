that
provision
that
you
--
that
policy
is
not
directly
before
that
court,
and
was
invalidated
by
the
district
court
and
you
took
no
appeals,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
one
other
question
now
that
you’re
interrupted.
on
a
1000-foot
part
of
the
ordinance,
i
take
it,
it
means
that
the
entrepreneur
must
know
not
only
what
he
is
doing
he
has
to
know
what
other
people
within
that
radius
are
doing.
he
has
to
determine
that
they
are
regulated
uses
before
he
can
undertake
operations,
is
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
even
without
regulation
that
these
kinds
of
establishments
would
have
to
have
to
have
license
of
some
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
any
other
type
--
i
take
it,
any
other
kind
of
a
theater
could
be
located
right
next
to
a
residential
zone
or
two
theaters
could
be
located
right
next
to
each
other
if
they
are
in
this
category?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
could
be
right
up
against
the
residential
zone?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
could
be
next
to
each
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
moving
picture
theaters
are
licensed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
not
claiming
the
ordinance
is
vague
as
applied
to
your
clients,
you
are
in
effect
making
an
overbreadth
analysis,
and
you
claim
standing
to
assert
to
claim
some
other
business
establishments?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
we
doubt
about
the
fact
that
this
ordinance
applies
to
the
businesses
operated
by
your
clients?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
are
really
asserting
that
it’s
vague
as
applied
to
other
uses
different
from
those
put
on
by
your
own
clients?
justice
byron
r.
