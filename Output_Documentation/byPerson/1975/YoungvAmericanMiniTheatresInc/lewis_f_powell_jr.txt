justice
lewis
f.
powell,

are
there
adult
businesses
regulated
exactly
in
the
same
way
that
some
of
the
other
restricted
uses
are
regulated
such
as
bars
and
motels
and
pawnshops
and
the
like?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
terms
of
the
1000-foot
restriction,
there
is
no
distinction
made
in
terms
of
location?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
not
before
us,
so
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
maybe,
we
didn’t
give
you
enough
--
very
much
time
to
argue
what
you
have
in
mind.
i
do
wish
you’ve
reached
the
charge
that
this
ordinance
is
vague
and
overbroad,
for
example
a
language
with
respect
to
bookstores
refers
to
stores
that
have
a
substantial
or
significant
part
of
their
stock
in
trade
within
this
scope
of
the
definition,
what
response
do
you
make
to
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
would
you
determine
substantiality
with
respect
to
a
particular
store?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
provision
for
an
administrative
hearing
to
make
the
determination?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
she
decided
below?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
tell
me
this,
is
your
theater
located
in
one
of
the
districts
were
adult
theaters
maybe
located?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
my
next
question
is,
are
you
within
the
1000
feet
of
another
adult
theater?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
happens?
do
all
three
have
to
go
out
of
business?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
mean,
is
that
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
though
you’ve
been
established
before
the
ordinance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
we
have
theater
in
either
of
these
cases
located
in
an
area
where
adult
theaters
may
not
be
located
under
the
ordinance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
suppose
--
i
gather
these
1000
or
500-foot
limitations
apply
only
to
theaters,
defined
as
adult?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
you
didn’t
have
the
limitation,
but
rather
that
1000
and
500-foot
limitation
should
apply
to
all
theaters?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wouldn’t
it
be
here,
would
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
say
that
that
would
notwithstanding
the
first
amendment
provisions,
that
kind
of
zoning
would
be
all
right?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
though
there
are
no
other
businesses,
even
though
no
other
businesses
are
in
the
area?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
you
say
it
again?
theaters
have
to
be
without
regard
to
whether
they’re
adult
theaters
or
not.
no
two
theaters
can
be
close
within
a
1000
feet
to
each
other
nor
closer
than
500
feet
to
a
residential
district?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
problem
then
without
the
first
amendment
--
