is
it
your
position
that

may
not
be

can
it

be

then
no
differentiations
on
the
basic
kind.
supposing
for
example
in
the
neighborhood
next
to
an
elementary
school,
the
city
permitted
a
theater
to
show
nothing
but
walt
disney
cartoons,
if
it
granted
that
permission,
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
it
must
therefore
also
grant
permission
to
show
anything
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
youâ€™re
saying
its
okay
to
look
at
the
content
only
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
juveniles,
but
there
is
no
such
showing
made
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
that
you
could
avoid
the
advertising
outside
the
theater
that
would
attract

justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
case
of
young
against
mini
theaters,
the
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
a
zoning
ordinance
is
adopted
by
the
city
of
detroit,
differentiates
between
motion
picture
theaters
which
exhibits
sexually
explicit
adult
movies
and
those
which
do
not.
an
adult
theater
is
defined
as
one
which
presents
material
distinguished
or
characterized
by
an
emphasis
on
matter
depicting
or
describing
specified
sexual
activities
or
specified
anatomical
areas
which
are
defined
in
some
detail
in
the
ordinances.
adult
theaters
may
not
be
located
within
one
thousand
feet
of
any
two
other
regulated
uses
which,
it's
a
term
which
includes
not
only
adult
theaters,
but
also
adult
bookstores
and
certain
other
types
of
commercial
establishments
or
within
a
five
hundred
feet
of
a
residential
area.
the
two
--
the
owners
of
two
adult
theaters
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
eastern
district
of
michigan,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinances
on
three
principle
grants.
first;
that
the
ordinances
are
so
vague
that
they
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
second;
that
they
are
prior
restraints
on
constitutionally
protected
communication,
and
therefore,
violate
the
first
amendment,
and
third;
that
the
classification
of
theaters
on
the
basis
of
the
content
of
their
exhibition
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
rejected
each
of
these
arguments.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
with
one
judge
dissenting
held
the
ordinance
as
invalid,
primarily
on
equal
protection
grounds.
we
read
first
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
ordinances
are
not
vague
as
applied
to
the
two
theater
owners
who
brought
this
action
and
that
these
two
plaintiffs
may
not
assert
the
possible
vagueness
of
the
ordinances
as
applied
to
situations
or
parties
not
before
the
court.
we
also
hold
that
the
zoning
requirement
which
restricts
the
location
of
adult
theaters,
but
which
does
not
limit
either
the
number
of
such
theaters
or
the
availability
to
the
public
of
the
kind
of
motion
pictures
which
they
exhibit
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
finally,
after
reviewing
situations
in
which
the
content
of
a
communication
determines
whether
it
is
constitutionally
protected
or
whether
even
if
protected
it
may
give
rise
to
liability
for
defamation
or
as
in
the
area
of
commercial
speech
may
have
a
lesser
degree
of
constitutional
protection.
and
after
noting
that
all
members
of
the
court
agree
that
sexually
explicit
material
maybe
limited
in
it's
distribution
to
adults.
we
hold
that
the
city's
interest
in
preserving
the
character
of
it's
neighborhood
justifies
the
zoning
ordinances
which
place
these
theaters
in
a
different
classification
than
other
motion
picture
theaters.
mr.
justice
powell
has
joined
in
parts
one
and
two
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
stating
separate
views
with
respect
to
the
third
issue.
and
mr.
justice
stewart
will
announce
the
dissenting
opinion.
