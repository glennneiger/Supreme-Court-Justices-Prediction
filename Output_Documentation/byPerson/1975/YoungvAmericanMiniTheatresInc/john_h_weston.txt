mr.
john
h.
weston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
critical
it
seems
to
recall
in
this
case
at
all
times
that
notwithstanding
the
suggestion
and
possible
implication
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
earlier
in
my
colleague’s
argument
that
we
are
dealing
here
only
with
speech
which
is
presumptively
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
the
definitions
under
this
ordinance
are
not
the
merely
definitions
nor
it
there
any
question
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
material
which
has
previously
been
found
under
procedural
safeguards
to
be
obscene.
so
we
are
dealing
here
with
absolutely
presumptively
protected
speech
and
we
resist
and
resent
the
attempt
on
the
part
of
petitioners
to
try
to
deal
with
disseminators,
and
places
or
dissemination
of
presumptively
protected
constitutional
speech,
in
the
same
fashion
as
with
pool
halls,
with
grocery
stores,
with
flophouses,
with
billiard
parlors,
and
the
like.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no
your
honor,
not
at
all.
mr.
john
h.
weston
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
right
of
this
municipality
or
any
municipality
to
be
able
to
zone
in
traditional
way
and
in
fact
detroit,
this
has
been
pointed
out,
does
have
the
traditional
zoning
breakdown.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
i
suppose
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
would
say
there
is
nothing
required
about
that
of
course
your
honor.
but
in
this
case,
we
have,
where
detroit
has
previously
zoned
in
the
commercial,
residential
and
industrial
areas.
and
what
we’re
suggesting
is
that,
there
can
be
no
discrimination,
no
regulation
of
theaters
in
terms
of
--
in
the
name
of
zoning
on
the
basis
of
content
where
the
content
unquestionably
at
the
time
of
the
zoning
is
entitled
to
presumptive
constitutional
protection.
it’s
that
which
we
are
resisting.
if
the
city
wishes
to
say,
within
consistent
zoning
policies
that
no
theaters
may
be
located
in
a
particular
zone
or
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
there
may
be
other
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
because
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
is
a
new
inability
constitutionally
on
the
part
of
the
municipality
or
other
form
of
government
to
discriminate
against
theaters
on
the
basis
of
content
where
that
material
is
entitled
to
presumptive
protection
consideration
as
these
materials
are.
no
theater
is
one
thing,
just
as,
might
have
and
has
been
said
many
time
by
this
court
that
there
may
well
be
instances
where
to
picketing
may
be
undertaken
or
may
well
be
instances
where
there
are
no
speech
which
may
be
tolerated
under
circumstances.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well
it
seem
your
honor,
in
particularly
in
light
of
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
the
belle
terre
case
that
there
are
interests
which
are
supportable
constitutionally
in
our
municipal
areas
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
i
suppose
the
language
of
the
court
is
clear
to
preserve
a
certain
environment,
a
healthy
environment,
a
protective
environment
for
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
potentially
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
that
the
term
zoning
and
concepts
inherent
in
zoning
is
superimposed
on
some
sort
of
scheme,
no
more
confers
talismanic
community
from
constitutional
scrutiny
than
any
other
such
device
which
has
ever
been
before
this
court.
simply
because
the
word
zoning
is
utilize
does
not
end
the
question
and
the
use
of
the
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
that
may
well
be
the
case,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
and
because
of
the
deference
which
this
court
has
traditionally
given
to
certain
governmental
entities
in
terms
of
being
able
to
control
their
own
destinies,
subject
to
a
strict
analysis
of
constitutional
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
your
honor,
firstly
--
excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
weston
your
honor,
it
may
be
under
some
circumstances
which
are
not
present
in
this
case
and
which
are
not
present
in
the
record
which
we
have
before
us,
that
there
may
be
a
specific
entity,
a
specific
entity,
a
specific
theater,
a
specific
work
which
in
light
of
the
legitimate
and
compelling
interest
of
the
city
may
in
fact
be
regulated
as
under
any
form
of
speech
where
appropriate
specific
particular
questions
are
raised
with
regard
to
it.
there
is
nothing
unconstitutional
for
example
about
denying
to
a
particular
group
the
right
to
seek
a
forum
under
certain
circumstances.
there
may
well
be
a
particular
case.
we
do
not
have
this
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
weston
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
in
that
case
your
honor,
certainly
the
question
of
equal
protection
in
light
of
first
amendment
activities
making
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
content
would
be
vastly
deluded.
i’m
not
prepared
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
would
think
not
frankly.
there
might
well
be
if
they
were
certain
uses
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
your
honor,
that’s
what
i’m
trying
to
suggest
in
terms
of
the
reluc
--
the
refusal
them
of
the
city
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
content.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no
your
honor,
you
see
that’s
the
area
which
i’m
reluctant
to
concede
and
will
not
concede.
there
may
be
of
other
and
separate
first
amendment
problems
raised
by
an
attempt
to
exclude
theaters
wherefore
example
other
businesses
were
permitted.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
your
honor.
in
that
sense
that
would
eliminate
the
content
based
equal
protection
discrimination
of
which
we
complain
most
strongly.
it
would
not
necessarily
eliminate
that
fact
that
there
may
well
be
able
to
be
under
the
zoning
laws,
97
gas
stations
which
are
allowed
to
proliferate
near
one
another
within
1000
feet.
mr.
john
h.
weston
without
that
same
compelling
to
the
first
amendment,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
there
were
some
implicit
there
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
court
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
court
was
very
specific
in
that
in
noting
that
it
was
not
a
fundamental
right
involved
there
and
the
consequently
the
strict
scrutiny
test
was
not
required.
in
this
case
though,
it
is
conceded
by
all
parties
that
this
is
an
ordinance
which
directly
on
its
face
purports
to
regulate
first
amendment
activities,
for
on
the
basis
of
content
that
involves
the
fundamental
situation
and
consequently
the
strict
scrutiny
test
must
be
applied
and
it
is
our
position
and
in
this
sense,
we
differ
some
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
course
we
agree
that
the
discrimination,
the
distinctions
that
are
made
in
these
ordinances
cannot
stand
on
equal
protections.
however,
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
because
we
do
not
concede
that
the
city
of
detroit
has
a
legitimate
of
no
less
compelling
interest
in
the
ordinance
and
the
purposes
of
the
ordinances
which
they
have
set
up.
now,
let
me
be
very
clear
about
that.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
city
of
detroit
does
not
have
legitimate
interest
in
trying
to
maintain
nice
neighborhoods
and
a
fine
place
in
which
for
the
citizens
to
live
and
maintain
property
values
and
a
lovely
area
for
children
in
which
to
be
raised.
but
that’s
like
analyzing
an
ordinance
in
terms
of
the
interest
by
saying
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
do
good.
it
appears
that
we
must
be
more
precise
in
our
analysis
of
what
the
ordinance
is
and
looking
at
it
with
more
precision.
we
submit
that
the
purpose
of
that
ordinance
is
to
prevent
clustering
of
adult
theaters
based
on
question
of
content
on
the
basis
of
the
undifferentiated
fears
of
some
people
or
some
dominant
interest
in
the
community
that
bad
things
will
happen
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
where
the
speech
is
protected
justice
stevens,
it
is
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
certainly,
as
an
abstract
proposition,
i
would
agree
with
that
100%.
and
clearly,
it
appears
to
me
that
those
issues
justice
stevens
were
really
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
the
in
the
recent
erznoznik
decision
versus
city
of
jacksonville,
where
we
cannot
condition
necessarily,
that
which
is
fit
for
adults
on
that
which
is
fit
for
juveniles.
and
absence
some
greater
compelling
interest
and
demonstrated
need
which
we
do
not
have
in
this
case.
it
would
be,
it
isn’t
simply
not
possible
to
say
as
petitioners
have
tried
to
assert
that
this
case
is
based
on
a
desired
to
protect
juveniles,
that
theaters
are
by
definition
adult,
they
are
by
definition
and
either
commercial
or
industrial
areas,
this
is
not
an
area
simply
where
children
are
involved.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
city
wishes
to
assert
that
there
are
somehow
something
wrong
with
exterior
advertising
or
whatever
may
be
there
that
children
cannot
avoid
based
on
some
real
record
which
we
do
not
have
in
this
case.
then,
less
intrusive
regulation
on
first
amendment
rights
may
be
adopted
to
protect
against
those
specific,
not
generalized,
not
undifferentiated
fears
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
your
honor,
i’m
not
saying
that
at
all.
i’m
saying
that
as
a
general
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
what
i’m
suggesting
is
this,
i
recognize
for
example
that
the
erznoznik
opinion
is
limited
to
some
extent
in
that
obscene
material
on
the
outside
of
a
billboard
or
for
example
material
which
might
not
be
obscene
for
adults
but
which
perhaps
might
be
harmful
matter
for
juveniles.
stronger
material
than
was
involved
in
erznoznik
might
be
by
appropriate
legislation
or
zoning
limited
so
that
it
could
not
be
exposed
to
juveniles
in
this
600-foot
circumstance
from
schools.
what
i’m
saying
however
is
that
content
of
a
theater,
content
of
films
or
books
sold
in
the
theater
or
bookstore
which
are
not
exposed
to
juveniles
which
are
not
present
in
this
factual
circumstance
such
as
you
said,
in
the
absence
of
a
very
specific
record
which
i
really
frankly
cannot
even
imagine,
may
not
be
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
content.
that
is
the
position
which
we
assert.
mr.
john
h.
weston
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
flat
assertion
that
the
court
has
made,
i
would
say
that
there
would
simply
have
to
be
a
stronger
showing
that
theaters
exhibiting
western
somehow
attract
more
horses
i
suppose,
let
alone
anything
else
then
--
mr.
john
h.
weston
your
honor,
it
would
appear
that
in
the
absence
of
a
compelling
state
interest,
in
the
preservation
of
the
streets,
anymore
than
an
interest
which
this
court
has
ruled
insubstantial
to
prohibit
the
distribution
of
hand
bills
in
the
name
of
littering
which
simply
not
be
appropriate
to
justify
discriminating
against
presumptively
protected
disseminators
of
speech
or
dissemination
of
presumptively
protected
speech
on
the
basis
of
conduct.
and
i
would,
without
question
exhort
this
court
not
to
remove
that
bulwark
in
the
american
constitution.
mr.
john
h.
weston
yes,
i
understand
your
honor.
again,
i
would
certainly,
again
--
without
talking
about
discriminatory
enforcement
making
on
it’s
face,
that
certainly
becomes
much
more
like
o’brien
where
the
ordinance
involved
is
not
--
ordinance
or
statute
is
not
seeking
directly
to
limit
first
amendment
rights
and
i
think
at
that
point,
then
the
counsel’s
o’brien
analysis
would
obtain
whereas
in
this
case,
it
seems
totally
misplaced
whatsoever.
thank
you.
