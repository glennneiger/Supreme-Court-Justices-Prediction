mrs.
reilly,
does
the
amended
ordinance
now
within
500
feet
of
a
residentially
zoned
district
continue
that
waiver,
provision
of
51%?
unknown
speaker
because
as
i
understand,
the
initial
ordinance
had
--
it
could
not
be
located
within
500
feet
of
a
residential
unit
unless
the
provision
was
waived
by
the
consent
of
some
51%
of
the
persons
living
or
doing
business
within
500
feet.
unknown
speaker
i
have
amended
it
to
really
can’t
be
within
the
500
feet
of
a
residentially
zoned
district.
unknown
speaker
but
may
there
also
be
the
waiver
by
consent
of
51%?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
reilly,
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
reilly,
--
unknown
speaker
--
do
you
characterize
this
case
as
a
first
amendment
case
or
something
else?
unknown
speaker
are
you
trying
to
bring
in
some
place
exceptions?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
or
have
you
suggested
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
these
restrictions
is
to
maintain
property
values,
like
zoning
sometimes
is
aimed
at?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
reilly,
how
permanent
is
the
classification?
in
other
words,
if
a
movie
shows
theater
shows
one
adult
theater
--
adult
performance
or
bookstore
has,
for
a
period
of
time,
an
inventory
of
adult
books,
is
it
then
permanently
prohibited
use
or
whatever
the
proper
term
is,
or
does
it
change
as
the
operation
changes?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
case
that
an
adult
theater
may
be
located
in
any
zone
in
which
a
non-adult
theater
is
located?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
in
detroit,
they
have
six;
is
it
business
zones,
b1
to
b6?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance
that
says
that
or
it
recites
that
adult
theaters
are
not
permitted
in
the
b1,
b2
or
b3
zones?
unknown
speaker
although
other
theaters
are?
unknown
speaker
you
would
think
that
general
provision
would
fall
if
you
win
this
case?
i
mean
not
just
the
500
or
1000-foot
--
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
should
answer
my
question
yes,
so
your
kind
of
theater,
your
kind
of
bookstore,
should
be
able
to
be
located
in
any
zone
in
which
a
an
ordinary
theater?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
consequences
of
having
the
commercial
establishments
say
are
--
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
can
have
a
b1,
b2,
b3
and
b4.
in
some
areas
you
can
have
pool
halls,
but
in
that
area
or
in
grocery
stores,
but
in
that
area,
you
could
have
secondhand
automobile
dealer?
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
consequences
and
the
characteristics
of
the
business.
unknown
speaker
now
what
if
one
theater
has
a
different
consequence
than
another?
it
may
be
because
of
its
content
that
it
has
a
different,
let’s
us
just
posit
that
one
kind
of
a
theater
has
a
different
impact
than
another.
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
say
that
the
one
could
be
--
that
neither
could
be
excluded
from
the
district?
unknown
speaker
a
non-adult
beside
--
with
an
adult
theater?
unknown
speaker
1000-foot
distance
has
to
between
two
adult
theaters?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
are
there
some
areas
in
which
adult
theaters
may
not
locate
that
other
theaters
may?
unknown
speaker
so
far
as
general
zoning
goes?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
pool
halls,
and
shoeshine
parlors,
and
motels
and
hotels
are
presumptively
legitimate
operations
too?
unknown
speaker
we
padlocked
them.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
a
theater
if
its
large
enough
can
cause,
it
might
be
considered
adverse
effects
in
the
neighborhood
by
bringing
a
lot
of
traffic
and
a
lot
of
noisy
people
late
at
night,
isn’t
that
true?
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
non-neighborhood
people?
unknown
speaker
for
instance
that’s
the
reason
you
exclude
from
residence
“a”
districts
and
from
commercial
b1
and
2
and
3,
all
theaters.
there’s
effect.
