justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
concededly
i
take
it,
mrs.
reilly,
some
of
the
material
sold
would
not
be
barred
or
could
not
be
barred
by
the
state
under
the
miller
case
and
the
paris
adult
theater.
that
you
can’t
call
this
simply
of
the
city
of
detroit’s
effort
to
deal
with
something
could
be
thought
to
be
obscene?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don’t
you
think
that
your
case
would
be
in
a
somewhat
weaker
position
if
the
detroit
city
council
simply
said,
“we
don’t
like
this
kind
of
material,
and
so
we’re
going
to
limit
the
number
of
outlets
that
is
put
it
straight
on
a
straight
content
basis,”
rather
than
as
i
understand,
they
did
say,
“we
don’t
like
the
consequences
that
come
in
the
way
of
places
that
sell
this
material.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taylor,
do
you
think
that
the
city
of
detroit
could
have
said
in
an
ordinance
that
regulated
uses
such
as
those
conducted
by
your
client
and
pool
halls
and
the
other
regulated
could
not
be
established
within
600
feet
of
an
elementary
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
they
had
asserted
the
interest
that
they
don’t
want
elementary
schools
students
coming
and
going
from
the
school
to
be
exposed
to
those
kind
of
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
realize
that.
i
was
asking
you
a
hypothetical
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
should
a
pool
hall
under
your
constitutional
theory
be
able
to
be
located
at
any
zoning
district
where
a
grocery
store
can
be
located?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
it
the
city
says,
pool
halls
and
adult
theaters
produce
exactly
the
same
consequences,
attract
adults
kind
of
a
c-d
class
of
adults
in
the
eyes
of
the
city
and
we
simply
want
to
confine
them
or
limit
their
closeness
of
which
they’re
located
together?
why
can’t
the
city
do
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record.
isn’t
there
that
prostitution
tends
to
follow
these
types
of
operations
and
that
the
city
was
concerned
not
about
just
the
content
of
what
was
being
shown
but
about
the
attendant
consequences
when
the
neighborhood
took
on
these
characteristics.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weston,
supposing
then
instead
that
the
detroit,
this
were
dodge
city
and
there
the
50
years,
they
enacted
an
ordinance
that
no
movie
showing
western
films
could
be
within
a
1000
foot
--
feet
of
another
one
because
the
cowboys
came
in
on
horses.
and
they
just
couldn’t
accommodate
all
the
horses
if
the
theaters
were
too
close
together.
now,
would
you
say
there
is
something
wrong
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
it
was
that
kind
of
a
showing?
