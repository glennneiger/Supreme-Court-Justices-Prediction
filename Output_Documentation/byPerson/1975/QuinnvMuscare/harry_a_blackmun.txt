(inaudible)
that
the
grooming
code
is
constitutional,
what
would
be
the
occasion
for
a
hearing
on
remand?
justice
harry
a.

even
if
the
grooming
code
--
justice
harry
a.

open
type
hearing,
at
least?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
what
my
brother
white
is
trying
to
find
out?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
arnett
against
kennedy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
argument
that
has
to
do
with
the
deprival
of
pay
until
after
the
hearing
and
i
am
asking
whether
the
factual
situation
in
arnett
against
kennedy
was
not
precisely
the
same
in
this
respect
as
in
this
case?
