justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
respondent
contends
here,
does
he
not,
that
even
though
the
facts
surrounding
the
gas
masks
incident
maybe
undisputed.
he
should
at
least
have
had
a
hearing
in
order
to
argue
whether
a
penalty
should
be
imposed,
in
effect
argue
a
mitigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
understand
the
respondents
to
have
ever
made
the
contention
that
a
29-day
suspension
for
a
violation
of
this
regulation,
assuming
that
procedural
due
process
was
complied
with
and
assuming
that
the
regulation
is
valid,
is
some
sort
of
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
or
so
arbitrary
that
the
punishment
itself
would
violate
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
quinlan.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
looking
at
page
nine
of
the
appendix,
it
appears
that
respondent
did
request
backpay
as
a
part
of
his
claim
for
relief
in
the
district
court
because
he
was
not
given
a
pre-suspension
hearing.
i
suppose
that
element
of
his
claim
would
survive
regardless
of
the
amendment
of
the
regulations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably,
if
all
he
sought
was
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
these
regulations
and
you
changed
the
regulations,
the
injunctive
issue
may
well
be
moot,
but
if
he
seeks
backpay
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
the
injunction
that
claim
survive
i
would
think,
even
though
you
changed
the
regulation,
so
that
injunctive
relief
would
be
no
longer
appropriate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ms.
hirshman
there
is
no
proviso
in
the
regulation
is
that
you
are
exempt
from
it
if
your
self-contained
breathing
apparatus
fits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
not
the
avail
--
the
remedies
available
on
the
later
hearings
at
least
serve
to
factually
distinguish
this
case
from
goss
which
the
seventh
circuit
relied
on.
here,
your
man
can
get
backpay
and
he
can
get
expungement
whereas
i
take
it
in
goss
there
was
no
way
that
a
later
hearing
could
have
restored
the
school
children
to
the
days
they
missed
in
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
and
an
element
about
mitigation
here,
it
seems
to
me
along
the
lines
of
justice
whiteâ€™s
question.
even
if
you
are
right
about
the
constitutional
claim
about
pre-suspension
hearing,
what
you
are
asking
for
now
is
in
effect
on
award
of
two
years
backpay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
he
go
back
to
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
okay,
you
are
asking
for
29
days,
$1,400.00
backpay
whereas
for
all
we
know
if
you
had
gone
for
the
post-suspension
hearing,
you
might
have
won
and
15
days
after
the
suspension
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
you
might
have
been
reinstated.
how
do
you
know
that
that
is
not
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
okay,
so
the
statute
does
not
affirmatively
grant
you
the
right.
what
about
the
procedures
of
the
civil
service
commission?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
their
calendar
was
such
you
could
have
not
been
heard?
