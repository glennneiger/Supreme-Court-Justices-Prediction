we
will
hear
our
arguments
first
this
morning
in
75-130,
robert
quinn
against
muscare.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
in
the
civil
service.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
suppose
he
had
taken
that
route,
asked
for
a
review
and
they
sustained
his
position,
would
he
have
received
the
backpay
for
whatever
the
period
had
elapsed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
that
is
asking
for
the
--
or
is
there
anything
that
he
is
asking
for
that
he
could
not
have
got
conceivably
by
the
administrative
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
hirshman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
speaking
of
the
classroom
episode?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
free
to
ask
for
what
would
be
the
equivalent
of
bill
of
particulars?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
emphasize
to
us
paragraph
three
that
is
his
affidavit,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
precise
that
the
chief
instructed
him
to
shave
his
beard
off
and
that
he
declined
to
do
so.
now,
what
could
a
notice
tell
you
about
that
his
affidavit
did
not
show?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
possibility
that
the
administration
of
the
fire
department
is
concerned
that
if
they
let
muscare
have
a
small
mustache
the
next
thing
they
will
have
is
a
man
who
wants
a
little
bit
longer
one
and
somebody
else
a
little
longer?
is
this
not
a
matter
on
which
administration
of
the
--
an
organization
like
this
has
to
have
some
regulations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
do
with
his
â€“
with
the
matter
of
obeying
orders
when
his
order
to
dispense
with
the
beard,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
75-130,
quinn
against
muscare.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
grant
of
certiorari
to
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
mr.
