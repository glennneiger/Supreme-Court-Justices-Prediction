mr.
william
r.
quinlan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fundamental
issues
presented
for
review
here
are,
one,
whether
in
suspensions
of
none
probationary
state
and
local
governmental
employees
for
a
cause,
due
process
requires
a
hearing
before
the
suspension
become
effective.
secondly,
is
due
process
satisfied
by
a
co-suspension
hearing
where,
in
the
event
the
charges
against
the
employee
are
disallowed,
he
is
awarded
backpay
and
the
suspension
is
deleted
from
the
employee’s
service
record.
additionally
because
of
the
context
in
which
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
there
is
a
collateral
issue.
that
is
whether
or
not
the
municipal
fire
departments
can
constitutionally
promulgate
rules
requiring
as
firefighters
to
limit
the
amount
and
location
of
their
facial
hair
for
among
other
reasons
to
ensure
the
efficient
operation
of
gas
masks
that
firefighters
are
required
to
wear.
the
facts
are
basically
as
follows.
the
respondent
francis
muscare,
a
lieutenant
in
the
chicago
fire
department
has
been
a
firefighter
with
the
chicago
fire
department
since
1955.
the
chicago
fire
department
as
i
alluded
to
earlier
has
a
rule
511.33,
limiting
the
amount
of
facial
hair
that
maybe
worn
by
firefighters
to
at
most
a
small
mustache
and
precisely
limited
sideburns
with
no
beard.
but
from
october
1973,
until
the
trial
of
this
cause
in
march
1974,
lieutenant
muscare
wore
a
goatee.
in
fact,
some
three
years
before,
muscare
had
worn
the
same
sort
of
beard.
at
that
time
he
had
been
ordered
to
shave
it
off,
but
refused.
in
consequence
at
a
uniform
inspection,
the
superior
officers
declined
to
inspect
him.
he
then
brought
himself
in
to
compliance
by
shaving.
the
following
year,
mr.
muscare
again
grew
a
beard.
this
time
he
was
summoned
before
departmental
board,
consisting
of
two
fire
chiefs
and
an
instructor
in
the
fire
academy
in
the
use
of
safety
masks.
at
that
hearing
he
was
told
to
shave
off
the
beard
again
and
again
lieutenant
muscare
reluctantly
complied.
however,
in
december
1973,
when
lieutenant
muscare
appeared
with
his
squad
at
chicago
fire
department
academy
for
instruction
in
a
two-day
course
in
the
use
of
self-contained
breathing
apparatus
which
were
safety
masks,
he
was
again
wearing
a
beard.
the
instructor
was
firefighter,
leonard
johnson.
later
at
the
trial,
johnson
testified
that
during
the
class,
he
informed
muscare
on
the
basis
of
the
instruction
material
that
he
had
been
provided
with
and
his
experience
that
facial
hair
should
not
be
worn
with
safety
mask.
muscare
disputed
this
and
contented
that
new
york
and
boston
permitted
firefighters
to
wear
long
hair
and
beards.
each
member
of
the
class
was
expected
to
put
the
apparatus
on,
charge
it
and
test
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
getting
a
good
facial
fit.
johnson
stated
that
by
watching
a
firefighter
try
on
the
mask,
he
could
tell
whether
he
succeeded
in
attaining
a
tight
facial
seal.
but
muscare
failed
to
test
the
apparatus
in
the
class
at
fire
academy.
i
might
indicate
from
the
record,
it
is
not
clear
whether
a
lieutenant
would
be
required
to
do
so
since
he
was
dealing
with
the
firefighter
as
an
instructor.
however,
he
did
not
in
fact
try
on
the
mask.
on
the
second
day
of
class,
each
student
was
expected
to
walk
up
five
floors
of
the
fire
academy
building
and
then
back
down
to
the
first
floor
with
the
gas
mask
on,
sealed
and
functioning,
muscare
did
not.
instructor
johnson
stated
at
the
trial
that
he
did
not
know
whether
muscare
while
wearing
his
beard
could
get
a
good
seal
on
the
mask
because
muscare
did
not
put
the
mask
on
and
a
gas
mask
can
be
tested
only
by
a
man
putting
it
on.
in
due
course,
instructor
johnson
reported
muscare’s
conduct
in
the
class
to
the
drill
master.
muscare
was
soon
in
the
same
month,
december
1973,
warned
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
continue
working
unless
he
shaved
off
his
beard.
a
few
days
later,
muscare
was
advised
that
charges
had
been
filed
against
him
with
the
administrative
authorities
of
the
fire
department.
because
of
the
fortuitous
circumstances,
the
superior
with
authority
to
impose
a
penalty
was
taken
ill
with
appendicitis,
no
further
action
was
taken
for
more
than
two
months.
then
a
suspension
of
29
days
was
issued
on
february
of
1974
to
muscare
and
he
was
notified
in
person
by
three
superior
officers
who
came
to
his
fire
station
and
informed
him
that
he
was
suspended,
effective
immediately.
a
letter
subsequently
followed
on
march
4,
1974
from
the
chief
of
personnel,
chief
brown,
indicated
that
he
was
charged
of
violation
of
three
rules.
the
first
rule
was
the
failure
to
conform
to
the
grooming
code.
the
second
rule
was
his
violation
of
conduct
unbecoming
a
firefighter
and
the
third
violation
was
his
disobedience
of
a
direct
and
lawful
order.
muscare
did
not
ask,
exercised
his
statutory
right
provided
for
under
the
illinois
statute,
chapter
24,
section
18-1
to
a
hearing
before
the
civil
service
commission.
the
civil
service
commission
is
empowered,
and
in
the
event
it
finds
the
suspension
unwarranted,
that
the
employee
would
be
entitled
to
backpay
for
the
period
of
the
suspension
and
erasure
of
the
suspension
from
his
employment.
from
an
adverse
determination
of
the
commission,
the
employee
has
a
statutory
right
to
judicial
review
with
the
right
of
further
appeal
to
the
higher
court.
muscare
failed
to
exhaust
these
remedies.
instead
of
exhausting
his
administrative
remedies
before
the
civil
service
commission,
muscare
filed
the
instant
lawsuit
under
43
u.s.c.
1983
on
march
11.
the
basic
thrust
of
the
complaint
dealt
with
--
asked
for
declaratory
injunctive
relief
on
the
grounds
that
the
grooming
code
of
the
fire
department
infringed
upon
his
constitutional
rights
and
the
other
two
violations
that
he
had
been
charged
with,
were
both
vague,
and
therefore,
overly
broad
and
unconstitutional.
he
also
indicated
that
he
did
receive
due
process
of
law
in
the
imposition
of
this
penalty.
the
district
court
denied
both
a
temporary
and
permanent
injunction,
upheld
the
validity
of
the
no-beard
rule,
indicating
that
muscare
had
been
afforded
due
process
and
entered
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
department.
primarily
the
court
did
not
look
to
any
of
the
other
two
reasons
that
had
been
alleged
for
the
basis
of
this
grooming
code,
one
of
which
was
the
fire
department
was
a
paramilitary
organization
and
as
such
required
discipline
and
to
that
grooming
code
was
appropriate
in
a
uniformed
force.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
was
primarily
not
the
thrust
of
the
argument
before
the
district
court.
it
came
out
on
a
preliminary
injunction
and
motions
were
filed
in
support
in
opposition
to
the
preliminary
injunction.
he
determined
that
the
facial
or
the
grooming
code
of
the
department
was
rationally
related
to
safety
measures,
although
other
arguments
had
been
made
for.
the
issue
was
raised
on
a
motion
for
reconsideration
and
due
process
issues
were
also
raised.
he
then
indicated
that
his
judgment
presumed
that
the
due
process
was
satisfactorily
to
comply
with
the
constitution
and
accordingly
the
judgment,
i
would
say,
was
based
both
upon
those
grounds.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no
sir.
that
is
quite
correct.
on
appeal,
the
attention
focused
then
on
the
due
process
issue
as
opposed
to
the
validity
of
the
grooming
code.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
finding
that
no
hearing
of
any
kind
was
afforded
to
the
appellant
prior
to
his
suspension
and
that
post-suspension
review
provided
by
state
statute
would
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
due
process.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
determine
whether
a
trial
type
proceeding
was
essential
to
due
process.
in
order,
the
court
deemed
it
necessary
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
fire
department’s
no-beard
rule.
the
court
here
granted
certiorari
on
march
14,
1975.
as
we
view
the
issues,
there
are
several
considerations
that
we
believe
ought
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
resolving
this
question.
initially,
in
a
governmental
type
of
employment
situation,
the
argument
is
raised,
whether
it
is
a
property
interest
or
some
liberty
interest
violated
before
due
process
applies.
we
believe
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
dealing
with
governmental
employees,
that
any
property
interest
in
the
job
is
determined
by
a
state
statute
or
by
contract.
here
we
have
a
state
statute
which
provides
for
a
non-probationary
employee
to
receive
certain
rights.
one
of
these
rights
is
a
hearing,
if
he
is
suspended
from
more
than
5
days
subsequent
to
the
suspension
with
a
period
from
one
to
five
days,
no
hearing
is
provided.
for
any
procedure
for
a
suspension
beyond
five
days,
then
there
is
a
full
blown
hearing
required
before
the
sanction
can
be
imposed.
he
is
entitled
to
counsel,
notice
of
written
charges
and
subpoena
powers
available
both
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
to
the
individual.
so
in
this
context
it
is
our
argument
that
the
property
right
of
the
individual
is
determined
by
the
statute.
once
the
property
right
is
determined
by
the
statute,
the
question
then
becomes
what
is
necessary
to
accomplish
due
process
of
law
in
that
context
as
we
view
the
case.
under
our
interpretation
of
the
cases
of
this
court,
particularly
arnett
versus
kennedy,
it
is
not
required
that
the
individual
have
a
pretrial
or
pre-suspension
hearing.
arnett
as
the
court
will
recall,
was
a
termination
case.
this
is
a
suspension
case
and
under
these
circumstances
we
believe
that
the
right
to
a
hearing
subsequent
to
the
imposition
of
a
suspension
of
more
than
five
days
is
adequate
due
process
under
these
circumstances.
on
the
five-day
position,
with
one
to
five
days,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
the
legislature
has
recognized
this
as
not
involving
a
property
right
at
all.
that
this
would
be
reviewable
only
on
the
basis
of
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
by
writ
of
mandamus
or
perhaps
by
filing
a
1983
action
in
united
states
district
court
to
review
whether
the
action
taken
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
post
trial
hearing
or
the
post
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
contention
was
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process
on
the
basis
of
goss
versus
lopez
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
court
did
not
answer
that
question.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
he
indicated
that
he
was
entitled
to
some
right
to
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
about
whether
--
one
of
his
contents
is
about
whether
or
not
the
29-day
suspension
was
a
severe
suspension
under
the
circumstances
also
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
as
to
his
wearing
of
the
goatee?
no
there
was
not.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
there
was
a
factual
dispute
in
relation
to
whether
or
not
one
could
get
a
close
fit
or
a
tight
fit,
even
if
he
had
facial
hair.
it
was
admitted
by
the
expert
that
testified
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
chicago
as
well
as
by
the
drill
instructor
that
it
was
theoretically
possible
that
such
an
individual
could
obtain
a
good
or
secure
fit.
this
could
not
be
determined,
however,
without
the
individual
trying
on
the
masks.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
i
think
it
is
two-fold
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
white.
first
of
all,
it
was
upheld
at
the
district
court
level
as
being
a
general
rule
of
regulation
and
as
a
general
rule
it
could
be
applied
uniformly
even
though
in
specific
instances,
it
might
not
in
fact
cause
any
danger
or
safety
problem.
it
was
generic
and
uniform
rule.
so
i
think
that
on
that
ground
that
that
would
be
the
basis
of
doing
it.
second
of
all,
i
think
you
are
absolutely
correct.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
now
suggest
that
whether
or
not
the
right
to
wear
hair
or
hair
style
or
facial
beards
is
of
constitutional
dimension
in
dealing
with
police
and
fire
departments.
there
is
obviously
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
state
for
limiting
facial
hair.
so
in
the
first
point
it
was
general
rule
that
the
court
found
that
was
based
upon
a
rational
related
basis,
namely
safety
and
the
expert
did
testify
that
in
his
judgment,
facial
hair
would
cause
difficulties
in
getting
a
secure
fit
on
the
mask.
however,
he
indicated
that
because
of
the
structure
of
individual
faces,
because
of
the
differences
in
the
dental
structure,
chins
etcetera,
that
in
a
particular
instance
it
might
not
in
fact
cause
the
problem.
but
as
a
general
rule
it
was
his
opinion
that
facial
hair
would
prevent
or
could
prevent
a
close
or
tight
fit
on
the
gas
masks.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
he
does.
he
argues
for
a
pre-suspension
hearing.
there
is
a
post-suspension
hearing
procedure
provided
for
by
a
statute
that
he
did
not
avail
himself
of.
so
that
that
could
have
been
reviewed
at
that
time.
it
would
have
been
within
the
propriety
of
the
civil
service
commission
to
either
remove
it
completely
or
lower
it,
if
it
did
not
believe
that
was
the
appropriate
suspension
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
there
is
no
formalized
procedure
mr.
justice
white.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
have
these
opportunities
on
other
occasions.
he
once
went
before
departmental
review
board
to
argue
the
position.
it
was
rejected
by
the
departmental
review
board.
from
time
to
time
these
types
of
matters
have
been
matters
which
are
discussed
within
the
department
and
it
possible
to
secure
a
meeting
with
the
member
who
would
be
in
the
position
to
warrant
or
to
issue
that
particular
penalty.
this
divorced
the
record.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
support
that,
but
as
a
practical
matter
these
sources
have
been
available,
but
it
is
not
a
matter
of
procedure
nor
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
your
honor
we
consider
both
issues
to
be
before
you.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
this
court
of
course
has
the
power
to
review
the
facial
grooming
code
of
the
fire
department
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
it.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
if
the
court
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals'
requirement
was
correct,
there
was
a
due
process
hearing
necessary?
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
should
because
that
issue
then
would
remain
open
because
even
if
he
were
to
receive
a
hearing
or
this
court
will
require
a
pre-suspension
hearing,
the
entire
issue
then
comes
back
to
the
one
that
was
ruled
upon
on
the
district
court
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
rule
was
constitutional.
if
it
were
unconstitutional,
of
course,
then
whether
or
not
he
had
a
hearing
would
somewhat
irrelevant.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
we
did
make
that
point
that
your
honor,
yes,
that
he
had
the
choice
to
secure
administrative
remedies
under
the
state
procedures
and
he
did
not
do
so.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
occasion
for
hearing
on
remand?
the
basis,
if
this
court
were
to
assume
that
the
court
of
appeals
appropriately
interpreted
goss
versus
lopez
and
arnett
versus
kennedy,
then
of
course
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
that
you
cannot
impose
penalty
of
even
one
day
for
a
suspension
without
a
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
even
if
the
grooming
code
was
constitutional.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
but
we
suggest
that
avenue
was
open
to
him
by
seeking
a
review
before
the
civil
service
commission
which
he
did
not
avail
of.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
would
be
an
issue
and
that
would
be
one
of
the
things,
of
course,
if
he
had
employed
the
procedure
on
a
civil
service
commission.
civil
service
commission
would
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
suspension,
the
propriety
of
the
suspension
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
i
do
not
understand
him
to
make
argument.
as
i
understand
him,
their
argument,
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
that
he
was
entitled
to
offer
evidence
in
mitigation
to
determine
what
might
be
an
appropriate
penalty
and
that
perhaps
he
might
have
an
argument
that
in
his
case
he
could
wear
the
mask
or
that
he
was
advised
by
counsel
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
accordingly
these
might
be
grounds
upon
which
the
department
would
determine
that
such
a
suspension
was
unduly
severe.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
is
correct,
to
shave
off
the
beard.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
was
ordered
to
put
on
the
mask.
as
i
indicated
earlier
to
one
of
the
justices,
there
would
be
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
firefighter
could
direct
a
lieutenant
to
do
so.
normally,
they
will
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
it
was
a
masks
drill,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no
sir,
he
did
not
at
that
time.
he
indicated
that
he
subsequently
put
it
on.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no
sir,
that
is
not
the
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
he
probably
would
have
to
have
the
support
of
the
drill
master
under
such
circumstances.
normally,
they
participate
in
the
drill
and
it
takes
place
and
it
just
goes
forward.
in
this
instance
the
lieutenant
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no
sir.
he
was
notified
of
the
suspension.
he
was
notified
first
by
chief
morgan
that
unless
he
shaved
his
beard,
he
could
not
continue
to
serve
in
the
fire
service
and
a
couple
of
days
later
he
was
notified
that
charges
had
been
tendered
to
chief
fire
marshal
foley
who
was
the
only
one
authorized
to
impose
any
sanction
whatsoever.
chief
morgan
could
not
impose
any
sanction
under
the
rules
of
the
fire
department.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
is
not
clear.
the
charges
basically
as
i
understand
them,
again
as
it
holds
the
record
was
on
the
basis
of
failure
and
shave
off
the
goatee
on
--
after
receiving
a
direct
order
to
do
so.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
letter
from
the
chief
of
personnel
enumerated
the
three
regulations
for
which
he
was
in
violation
of,
one
of
which,
there
was
the
dress
code
which
specifically
provides
for
a
limited
wearing
of
side
burns,
a
mustache
that
cannot
go
beyond
the
lips
and
the
no-wearing
face
hair
on
the
chin
or
beard.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
the
direct,
the
lawful
one,
no,
it
did
not
specifically
specify.
there
were
no
specifications,
they
were
generic
charges.
they
would
evolve
obviously
from
the
situation
where
he
refused
the
order
of
chief
morgan
to
shave
off
the
goatee
and
then
this
would
conduct
--
constitute
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer.
under
the
state
law
of
illinois
any
of
the
charges,
if
sufficient,
would
be
grounds
for
the
suspension.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
it
might
be
if
you
are
getting
into
a
situation
when
you
are
talking
about
an
emergency
type
of
situation
because
of
the
context
in
which
it
takes
place
that
it
might
be
immediately
necessary
to
summarily
remove
somebody
from
that
position
as
a
firefighter
such
as
a
refuse
an
order
to
enter
a
building
or
refuse
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
it
is.
he
would
have
an
opportunity
if
he
chose
to
seek
review
of
that,
to
have
that
set
forth
on
the
basis
of
the
various
charges.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice
he
would
have
and
also
the
disciplinary
sanction
would
have
been
expunged
from
his
record,
so
that
he
would
have
been
right
back
where
he
started
with
as
having
never
been
disciplined.
the
only
problem
i
have
to
candidly
point
out
to
the
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
in
my
judgment,
quite
honestly
not.
however,
he
is
saying
that
he
has
a
right
before
any
sanction
is
imposed
to
a
hearing
because
the
fact
of
loss
wages
and
because
of
the
interference
with
his
alleged
property
right.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
he
could
have
raised
that
issue
at
that
time
and
the
propriety
of
that
would
have
been
reviewed.
i
probably
would
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
i
am
just
going
to
say
they
probably
would
not
have
decided
on
a
constitutional
basis,
but
have
--
would
have
reviewed
it
as
whether
or
not
it
was
a
reasonable
regulation
of
the
department.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
but
he
could
raise
the
constitutional
challenge
on
appeals
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
that
is
the
correct,
so
that
after
whatever
determination
the
civil
service
commission
made,
he
would
be
entitled
to
employ
judicial
review
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
your
honor
it
has.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
it
is
our
judgment,
it
does
affect
the
posture
of
this
case
because
that
this
was
a
voluntary
change
on
the
part
of
the
--
now
personnel
board
which
has
supplanted
the
civil
service
commission
and
the
fire
department.
the
basis
of
it
was
that
case
was
in
conflict
with
the
koppel
case
which
upheld
basically
the
review
after
more
than
five-day
suspension
plus
then
we
had
the
case
here,
quinn
versus
muscare
that
held
that
you
had
to
have
hearing
for
even
one-day.
accordingly
to
avoid
any
problem
with
issues
of
backpay
or
things
to
that
nature,
the
department
personnel
chose
to
adopt
a
regulation,
authorizing
review
for
suspensions
even
of
a
day
or
more.
it
breaks
down
into
three
different
categories.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
doubt
that
very
much.
the
procedure
has
not
a
long
inventory
of
experience,
but
this
is
like
any
personnel
procedure
that
is
adopted.
it
seems
that
once
you
take
a
step
forward,
if
it
seems
to
work
appropriately
and
is
more
satisfactory
to
the
personnel,
it
would
continue
to
persist.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
i
think
it
is
important
on
two-fold
basis.
one
of
which
is
the
aspect
whether
or
not
the
burden
would
be
on
the
employees
to
seek
review.
under
our
current
rules
and
regulations
for
anything
under
five-days,
he
must
file
a
written
notice
within
24
hours
with
the
department
asking
for
a
hearing.
he
has
a
hearing
then
before
a
departmental
officer.
if
he
concurs
in
the
original
judgment
that
is
certified
to
the
personnel
board
that
then
imposes
it,
but
if
he
writes
the
letter,
the
sanction
is
not
imposed
for
24
hours.
if
it
is
more
than
five
days,
he
then
has
24
hours
to
ask
for
review
by
the
civil
service
commission.
then
it
is
up
to
the
civil
service
commission
to
sustain
the
finding
of
the
department
or
the
individual
department.
if
it
is
obviously
for
more
than
30
days
between
five
and
30,
it
is
the
personal
board
that
would
determine
whether
the
department’s
action
is
appropriate,
he
has
to
request
it.
on
the
other
hand
if
it
is
more
than
30
days
then
changes
must
be
brought
against
him
officially
with
the
personnel
board
and
that
is
a
full
trial
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
if
you
were
to
hold
that
the
due
process
requirements
require
a
pre-trial
suspension
then
i
think
you
are
correct.
we
would
then
be
in
a
situation
where
we
had
suspended
him
inappropriately
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
backpay
for
that
period
time,
i
think
you
are
correct
sir.
i
would
like
to
save
whatever
little
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
just
quickly,
your
honor,
i
just
like
to
note
the
two
things.
one,
the
reasons
for
the
29
days
as
observed
on
page
134
of
the
abstract
where
of
this
severity
of
the
sanction
was
given
because
the
fact
has
occurred
before
and
he
had
not
shaved
the
beard
off
at
the
interim.
page
105,
the
abstract
indicates
that
chief
fire
marshall
foley
never
indicated
that
he
would
not
take
sanctions.
one
of
their
observations
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
i
think
we
do
have
to
have
some
minimal
guides
in
terms
to
standards
in
what
due
process
requires,
when
we
are
talking
about
applying
sanctions
to
some
40,000
employees
and
the
city
decides,
the
city
of
chicago.
finally,
in
its
order
on
page
161
of
the
abstract,
the
court
of
appeals
indicates
that
he
was
warned,
that
he
could
not
continue
as
a
firefighter.
i
do
not
think
that
whether
he
was
actually
warned,
he
could
not
continue
as
a
firefighter
or
not
is
of
any
real
substantial
dimension.
he
was
told
that
he
was
to
shave
off
his
beard
and
the
charges
had
been
filed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no.
we
adapted
the
rules
as
a
matter
of
--
if
we
continue
the
rules,
it
would
be
a
matter
employer
or
employee
relation.
we
are
not
saying
that
there
of
constitutional
dimension.
we
did
have
those
two
court
decisions
which
required
us
to
do
something
in
the
interim.
