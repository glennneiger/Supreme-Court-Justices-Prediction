justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
my
brother
rehnquist
is
trying
to
say
the
preliminary,
the
temporary
restraining
order,
the
preliminary
injunction,
all
along
are
gone
as
of
right
now,
is
that
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
all
you
have
now
is
what
you
could
get
from
the
commission.
i
think
that
is
his
point.
that
is
what
he
is
trying
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
is
he
asking
other
than
backpay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
for
the
future
that
he
might
get
in
trouble
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
get
that
from
the
commission?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
you
can
though.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
we
agree
that
it
is
possible
that
they
might
perhaps
under
some
circumstances
unknown
to
you
get
relief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.[laughter]
