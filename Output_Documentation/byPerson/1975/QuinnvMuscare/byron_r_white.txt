was
it
ever
indicated
below,
what
the
hearing
was
supposed
to
be
directed
at
or
what
was
the
need
for
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
pre-suspension
hearing
that
was
claimed.
what
would
be
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
what
would
the
hearing
direct
itself
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
ask
about
the
court,
about
the
party,
how
about
the
--
the
one
who
is
claiming
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
just
say
--
well,
i
will
put
it
in
another
way,
was
there
any
factual
dispute
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
other
factual
dispute
for
that
matter?

question
though
unless
you
say
that
there
is
some
limits
on
the
right
of
the
fire
department
to
prevent
beards?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
opportunity
at
all
before
the
suspension
takes
effect
for
him
to
write
a
letter
or
to
say
anything
at
all
to
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
charged
that
--
and
he
was
served
with
the
charges,
i
take
it
before
his
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
were
the
charges
that
were
made
against?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
what
did
letter
from
a
chief
of
personnel
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
say
that
he
was
in
violation
of
those
regulations,
did
it
mention
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
disobedience
of
orders?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
how
about
those
later
two
matters.
that
did
it
indicate
--
did
the
letter
indicate
what
those
charges
consisted
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
due
process
question
is
any
different
if
you
are
suspended
for
disobedience
to
an
order
than
when
you
are
suspended
for
disobeying
the
hair
code
or
if
you
are
charged
with
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
based
on
your
record
that
you
have
suspended
or
the
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
without
being
any
indication
what
the
conduct
was?
that
is
a
little
bit
different
than
saying
you
wore
a
mustache,
it
was
too
harsh?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
as
to
what
kind
of
hearing
you
had
to
have
before
suspension?
forget
what
kind
of
a
hearing
you
might
be
entitled
to
ultimately
--
whether
it
better
not
to
say
it
has
given
you
a
specific
notice
for
the
charges
and
said
if
you
have
anything
to
say
about
this,
write
us
a
letter
and
you
have
three
days
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
ask
--
what
i
ask
you
is
that
with
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
i
want
your
contention
is
--
i
want
to
know
what
your
contention
is,
what
kind
of
a
hearing
were
you
--
do
you
claim
you
were
entitled
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
what
is
your
contention
as
to
what
to
constitution
entitles
you
to
with
respect
to
a
pre-suspension
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
not
just
sum
up
one,
two
three,
what
your
claim
is
under
the
constitution.
what
kind
of
hearing
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
under
the
constitution?
one,
two,
three,
would
written
notice
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
an
opportunity
to
respond
in
writing
is
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
we
not
talk
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
here
to
say
that
constitution
entitles
you
to
an
oral
hearing
before
the
suspension
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
say
he
was
entitled
to
call
any
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
--
we
are
talking
about
this
case.
now,
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to,
would
have
been
entitled
to
call
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
general,
but
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
administrative
hearings
still
open
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
succeeded
in
whatever
it
was
you
wanted
to
present
that
hearing
you
would
get
backpay
to
the
initiation
of
the
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
you
think
there
are
factual
issues
and
some
real
substantive
content
that
a
hearing
might
have.
why
should
anyone
face
up
to
a
constitutional
issue
until
you
have
gone
to
taken
advantage
of
your
administrative
remedy
and
if
you
succeed,
you
will
be
reinstated
with
backpay,
which
is
all
we
could
do
for
your
client
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
have
then
gone
ahead
and
taken
your
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
you
wanted
more
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
you
were
not
immediately
put
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
did
you
not
pursue
your
administrative
remedies?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
would
have
gotten
an
adequate
notice
in
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless
you
might
have
won?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
we
decide
the
constitutionality
of
that
procedure
until
you
have
been
actually
deprived?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
way
we
can
--
the
only
judicial
remedy
that
can
be
is
to
give
you
--
is
to
reinstatement
with
backpay,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
if
you
do
not
want
a
new
(voice
overlap)
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
still
need
to
â€“
you
still
want
some
backpay
though?
