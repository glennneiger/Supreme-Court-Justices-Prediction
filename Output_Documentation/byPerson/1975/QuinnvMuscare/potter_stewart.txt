justice
potter
stewart
did
the
district
court
focus
on
the
procedural
due
process
question
that
became
the
foundation
of
court
of
appeals’
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
very
much
discussion
of
the
question
of
procedural
due
process
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
district
court
level,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
one
question
would
be
whether,
even
assuming
it
is
valid
regulation,
this
hair
mustache
and
goatee
regulation,
whether
or
not
a
29-day
suspension
was
too
harsh
a
penalty?
that
would
be
one
of
the
questions
to
be
inquired
into
at
any
hearing,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
can
it
involve
his
good
faith
belief
that
it
was
an
invalid
regulation
or
maybe
simply
might
involve
a
good
many
of
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
that
is
the
separate
question
that
is
just
--
by
my
brother
powell
as
to
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
claim
that
he
disobeyed
an
order
to
put
it
on
at
that
time?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
teacher,
the
instructor
was
a
firefighter
as
you
said
this
petitioner
is
or
this
respondent
was
a
lieutenant
and
there
would
be
some
question
about
the
power
of
a
firefighter
to
give
an
order
to
a
lieutenant,
even
in
the
environment
of
a
school?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
just
going
to
ask
if
there
was,
there
would
have
been
judicial
review
of
the
civil
service?
justice
potter
stewart
ms.
hirshman,
just
before
you
sit
down,
i
as
stated
add
to
your
problems
but
i
am
having
a
problem.
in
colloquy
with
my
brother
marshal,
you
explained
that
the
reason
that
you
were
here
and
the
reason
that
you
could
get
more
relief
here
than
you
could
have
in
the
administrative
proceedings
was
that
that
this
is
a
situation
that
is
capable
of
repetition
and
yet
evading
review.
and
yet
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
think
you
told
mr.
justice
blackmun
earlier,
the
rules
have
now
been
changed
and
they
have
been
changed
in
a
way
that
would
fully,
as
i
understand
it
fully
satisfy
your
constitutional
claim
and
there
is
in
no
indication
that
they
are
ever
going
to
be
changed
back?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand,
but
they
are
--
not
every
case
in
which
you
had
a
change
of
the
rules
of
the
game
and
that
wholly
satisfies
your
constitutional
claim
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
--
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
have
the
rules
–
have
these
rules
been
applied
to
your
clients
case
you
would
be
fully
satisfied
constitutionally,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
in
addition
to
these
rules
do
you
claim
the
constitution
requires?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
there
was
not
any
criminal
conduct
alleged
and
there
was
no
--
you
did
not
have
any
alibi
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
asking,
your
client,
he
would
have
faired,
he
would
have
had
everything
(voice
overlap),
would
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
you
are
a
careful
lawyer,
you
had
every
answer,
i
will
say
that.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
point
i
gather
is
that
you
agree
with
your
--
the
counsel
--
your
adversary
counsel
that
this
case
is
here
for
decision
and
should
be
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
nothing
moot
about
it?
