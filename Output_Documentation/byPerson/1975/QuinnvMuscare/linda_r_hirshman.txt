ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
linda
hirshman
and
i
represent
respondent
lieutenant
francis
muscare
in
this
action.
in
light
of
your
questions
of
mr.
quinlan,
i
think
would
like
to
begin
with
the
issue
of
what
a
hearing
might
have
consisted
of,
had
respondent
been
allowed
or
provided
with
even
the
most
rudimentary
hearing
prior
to
his
29-day
suspension.
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
that
respondent
was
suspended
from
his
employment
for
29
days,
based
on
three
violations
or
alleged
violations
of
three
chicago
fire
department
rules
and
regulations,
the
rule
prescribing
proper
personal
appearance,
the
rule
forbidding
disobedience
of
orders
and
the
rule
forbidding
conduct
unbecoming
a
member
or
employee
of
the
chicago
fire
department.
at
no
time
until
the
hearing
in
federal
court
on
his
constitutional
claims,
did
respondent
find
out
from
petitioner
what
underlying
facts
were
involved
in
their
charges
against
him?
however,
based
on
these
charges
alone,
obviously
there
are
several
levels
at
which
respondent
could
have
utilized
a
prior
hearing.
first
of
all,
on
the
question
of
proper
personal
appearance;
on
the
bare
facts
at
issue
here,
what
you
have
is
the
administration
taking
a
look
at
respondent
and
making
their
determination
without
ever
finding
out
from
him
for
example
whether
his
self-contained
breathing
apparatus
fits
which
he
testified
without
rebuttal
at
trial,
it
did
with
no
problem
at
drill
in
fighting
fires.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
mnow,
that
really
speaks
to
the
fact
that
of
the
city
--
the
petitioner
adhered
so
tenaciously
to
the
fact
that
the
only
justification
for
the
regulation
was
the
safe
use
of
the
self-contained
breathing
apparatus
and
indeed
we
would
go
to
mitigation,
if
not
to
the
substantive
violation.
the
fire
commissioner
has
a
range
of
penalties
which
he
can
impose
for
violation
of
the
range
of
rules
involved
in
the
fire
department
rules
and
regulations
of
which
respondent
was
accused
of
violating
three.
he
could
have
chosen
a
reprimand.
he
could
have
chosen
as
acting
chief
fire
marshal
foley
did
initially
in
december
to
do
nothing
to
respondent.
furthermore,
respondent
had
numerous
things
to
say
on
the
subject
of
disobedience
of
orders.
disobedience
of
orders
is
a
classic
factual
issue,
involving
questions
of
the
authority
to
give
the
order
which
we
saw
--
discussed
here
just
a
moment
ago.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
pardon
me?
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
either
classroom
episode
or
--
we
do
not
know
mr.
chief
justice
because
all
we
got
was
a
letter
that
said
disobedience
of
orders.
we
never
found
out
any
factual
basis,
what
orders
were
disobeyed,
who
gave
them?
whether
the
respondent
properly
heard
them,
whether
the
person
was
authorized
to
give
respondent
an
order
and
so
forth.
all
things
of
which
you
should
have
properly
been
notified
and
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
before
he
was
suspended
for
29
days.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no,
mr.
chief
justice
because
essentially
what
he
had
was,
a
chief
in
december
said
to
him,
he
did
not
say
to
him
you
cannot
continue
working
for
the
fire
department
if
you
continue
to
wear
your
goatee,
that
is
not
what
he
said.
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
which
is
there
or
--
i
am
sorry,
respondent’s
affidavit
which
is
the
only
place
where
there
is
any
evidence
about
the
encounter
between
chief
morgan
and
respondent
muscare.
you
will
see
that
it
is
not
what
chief
morgan
said.
he
said
something
like,
shave
the
beard
and
your
working
under
charges.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
in
the
appendix,
at
page
19,
paragraph
of
the
affidavit
three,
petitioner
never
brought
chief
morgan
to
testify
at
the
hearing
on
preliminary
injunction
and
so
respondent’s
affidavit
stands
on
rebuttal
on
the
subject
of
the
conversation
at
any
rate.
working
under
charges
is
in
a
sense
part
of
ongoing
employment
situation
and
very
different
from,
you
cannot
go
on
working
for?
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
that
is
certainly
would
have
been
a
great
improvement
to
over
what
they
did
do.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
mr.
justice
white,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
said
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
we
have
been
living
with
the
change
procedures
in
the
city
of
chicago
now
for
eight
months.
they
involve
a
notice
of
the
charges
against
you
and
24
hours
to
go
a
hearing
before,
depending
on
the
length
of
the
suspension,
on
the
internal
officer
or
the
personnel
board.
that
seems
to
be
working
satisfactorily
and
meets
the
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
this
is
a
pre-suspension
hearing
procedure
that
has
been
initiated.
my
position
would
--
was
through
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no,
your
honor
we
are
not
asking
for
a
open
type
hearing.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
we
are
not.
we
are
asking
for
effective
notice
--
well,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
particularly
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
arnett
versus
kennedy,
procedures
involving
notice
of
the
charges,
notice
of
the
material
underlying
the
charges,
the
opportunity
to
respond
orally
or
in
writing
i
think
depending
on
the
kind
of
charge
that
is
alleged
and
an
opportunity
for
a
decision.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
the
seventh
circuit
was
not
specific
and
we
have
a
graduated
procedure,
either
a
hearing
officer
or
the
personnel
board
which
is
presently
excellent.
we
are
not
asking
for
this
court
to
affirm
a
neutral
hearing
examiner.
that
is
not
what
is
at
issue
here.
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
city
did
nothing
before
they
suspended
lieutenant
muscare
so
that
we
would
have
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
written
notice,
and
including
the
underlying
facts.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i
think
it
depends
on
what
the
notice
consists
of
mr.
justice
white
because
some
kinds
of
things
are
susceptible
to
written
presentations.
other
kinds
of
things
for
example,
whether
or
not
lieutenant
muscare
got
a
good
fit
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
alright,
i
think
that
this
case
ought
to
have
involved
an
ability
to
appear
in
person.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i
am
asking
you
to
affirm
a
circuit
court
opinion
that
says
that
this
was
not
enough
and
we
will
work
out
what
is
enough
as
we
get
it
on
a
case
basis,
but
i
would
say
that
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
question,
a
disputed
question
of
fact
in,
for
example
in
mitigation
issue
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
man's
safety
masks
fit.
he
ought
to
have
been
given
a
moment
in
front
of
someone
with
the
authority
to
make
a
decision
about
the
severity
of
his
suspension
to
show
them
it
is
a
very
simple
test
that
he
gets
a
vacuum
seal
on
his
face
mask.
the
question
of
disobedience
of
orders
is
a
very
large
one
and
the
question
of
conduct
unbecoming
a
member
or
employee
of
the
fire
department
is
a
very
large
one
and
i
think
that
depending
on
what
the
specifics
of
the
charges
were
would
depend
on
how
much
of
a
hearing
he
would
be
asking
for.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i
think
it
varies
as
you
have
said
of
a
due
process
(voice
overlap)
situation.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
before
he
suspended
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
disobedience
of
orders
might
have
involved
incidence
in
which
calling
of
witnesses
would
be
very
pertinent.
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
notice
was
so
inadequate
that
we
cannot
really
speak
to
what
the
hearing
would
have
to
consist
of
until
we
had
a
decent
notice
of
what
the
charges
were.
so
i
think
yes.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
as
it
turns
out
that
was
not
what
acting
chief
fire
marshal
foley
had
in
mind
when
he
decided
to
suspend
lieutenant
muscare
for
29
days.
i
think
chief
fire
marshal
foley
had
in
mind
two
earlier
incidences
that
chief
foley
had
not
been
present
at,
but
that
he
just
heard
about,
when
he
determined
that
29-day
was
that
proper
suspension
length
for
lieutenant
muscare.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
there
is
a
testimony
to
that
effect
at
page
134.
answer:
this
particular
person
involved
to
have
been
involved
in
this
argument
about
hair
and
about
the
beard
prior
to
this
affair
had
complied
by
shaving
it
off.
now,
was
the
second
time
around.
now,
lieutenant
muscare
did
not
have
notice
that
acting
chief
fire
marshal
foley
had
in
his
mind
his
concept
of
what
had
gone
before
in
lieutenant
muscare’s
career,
never
had
a
chance
to
answer
him
anything
about
it
when
he
found
three
fire
marshals
entering
his
duty
station
and
telling
him
to
turn
in
his
badge
that
he
was
being
suspended
for
29-day
period,
involving
a
loss
a
$1,400.00
in
pay
for
him
and
essentially
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that,
and
by
the
way
just
as
in
a
side,
we
have
made
that
contention
that
due
process
was
violated
in
the
suspension
procedures
from
the
very
outset
of
this
litigation
and
that
is
contained
in
the
complaint
and
we
have
consistently
litigated
the
issue
and
there
is
a
substantial
testimony
in
the
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes,
there
is
no
time
when
on
administrative
hearing.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes,
the
problem
with
the
hearing
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
is
not
guaranteed
at
any
time
relative
to
the
suspension
that
is
at
stake.
there
is
no
guarantee
of
promptness
in
the
statute
whatsoever.
statute
is
silent
about
the
timing
of
the
later
hearing,
but
in
addition
to
that
at
the
later
hearing
under
the
existing
law,
lieutenant
muscare
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
suspension
was
wrongful,
based
on
a
letter
which
had
nothing,
but
three
rule
numbers
on
it
and
with
that
kind
of
notice,
without
ever
hearing
it,
as
it
turned
out,
we
have
found
out
in
the
trial
in
federal
court,
what
chief
foley
or
part
of
what
chief
foley
had
in
his
mind,
but
without
ever
hearing
that
and
nothing,
but
that
letter
under
the
illinois
law
his
later
hearing,
he
has
to
go
to
the
later
hearing
and
disprove
for
example
conduct
unbecoming
a
member
employee
of
the
chicago
fire
department
without
ever
knowing
what
underlay
those
charges.
and
so
the
later
hearing
is
obviously
insufficient
under
any
circumstances
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
is
no
issue
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
here.
first
of
all,
because
we
are
suing
under
1983
and
secondly
because
as
this
court
recently
pointed
out
in
matthews
versus
aldrich
where
you
have
a
claim
that
your
right
to
a
prior
hearing
has
been
violated,
then
you
do
not
have
to
exhaust
in
order
to
bring
your
constitutional
claim.
so
i
think
that
the
paucity
of
--
the
real
lack
of
value
of
the
later
hearing
is
illustrated
by
all
of
these
things.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
the
loss
of
the
pay
for
30
days
for
an
adult
--
he
was
working
and
earning,
relying
on
the
salaries
is
a
serious
deprivation
and
i
do
not
think
that
back
--
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
so
readily
distinguish
the
issue
on
the
grounds
that
you
could
always
get
backpay
because
as
this
court
has
noted
that
backpay
does
not
necessarily
make
up
for
the
taking
away
of
the
property
without
prior
procedures.
in
schneider
(ph),
the
woman
might
have
gotten
her
wages
back
in
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
my
understanding
of
arnett
versus
kennedy
is
that
three
of
the
justices
who
ruled
on
arnett
versus
kennedy
held
that
the
federal
employee
should
have
been
given
an
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
his
discharge
and
that
two
of
the
justices
held
that
the
very
protective
procedures
in
arnett
versus
kennedy
were
sufficient
to
satisfy
--
to
constitute
an
accommodation
of
competing
interests
and
that
three
of
you,
directed
yourselves
to
the
property
issue
and
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no,
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
in
arnett
versus
kennedy,
the
federal
employee
had
three
days
advanced
notice
of
the
pending
adverse
action
against
him.
he
had
an
opportunity
to
submit
affidavits
and
to
appear
orally.
he
had
a
copy
of
the
charges
and
the
material
underlying
the
charges.
he
had
a
really
substantially
protective
procedure
before
the
deprivation
was
imposed
and
my
understanding
of
this
court’s
recent
writing
in
boehning,
that
is
the
proper
pronunciation
versus
indiana
state
employees
association
is
that
the
question
of
--
that
arnett
did
not
determine
that
a
public
employee
could
be
suspended
or
discharged
without
any
prior
procedure.
indeed
this
case
stands
in
the
most
--
the
greatest
contrast
to
arnett
versus
kennedy
because
for
every
protective
procedure
in
arnett,
there
is
a
complete
void
of
protective
procedures
here.
in
place
of
30-days
advanced
notice,
fire
marshals
walked
into
lieutenant
muscare’s
fire
station
and
told
him
to
turn
in
his
badge.
in
place
of
a
copy
of
the
material
that
the
discharge
was
based
on,
lieutenant
muscare
did
not
find
out
even
what
chief
foley
had
in
his
mind
until
we
went
to
federal
court
on
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
actions
against
him.
so
that
if
arnett
represent
what
is
acceptable,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
represents
what
is
not
acceptable,
it
is
so
devoid.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
mr.
justice
white
when
we
sued
initially
in
district
court,
it
was
only
a
few
days
after
lieutenant
muscare
was
suspended.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
right,
but
there
is
--
unlike
the
preliminary
--
we
went
and
asked
for
temporary
restraining
order
and
then
for
preliminary
injunction
and
unlike
that
immediate
relief
what
we
were
looking
for
is
an
injunction
against
the
continued
imposition
of
the
suspension
against
lieutenant
muscare.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
if
they
had
immediately
put
him
back
then
the
damage
issue
would
be
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
first
of
all,
we
did
not
have
an
adequate
notice.
all
we
have
is
what
happened
to
come
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
we
would
have
to
go
to
a
hearing
at
which
we
bore
the
burden
of
truth
for
that
ever
having
had
adequate
prior
notice.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i
suppose,
but
we
still
have
that
option
available
to
us
and
then
we
can
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
the
deprivation
has
taken
place.
the
deprivation
is
the
deprivation
that
took
place
at
the
moment
of
the
suspension
was
(voice
overlap).
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
and
to
expunge
the
evidence
of
this
suspension
from
his
file.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
but
the
--
we
would
have
had
to
go
a
hearing
and
dispute
the
substance
after
improper
procedures
had
been
used
and
the
improper
procedures
are
such
that
they
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
effectively
to
dispute
the
substance.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
oh!
no,
he
was
only
suspended
for
29
days.
it
is
29
days
backpay.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
there
is
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
you
could
get
a
hearing
let
alone
a
decision
within
15
days.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
at
all,
your
honor.
we
had
a
several
valid
and
serious
constitutional
claims
against
the
suspension
which
was
being
levied
against
respondent.
we
were
asking
for
immediate
relief
in
the
form
of
a
temporary
restraining
order.
it
was
our
judgment
at
that
time
and
it
is
absolutely
devoid
the
record
and
so
i
really
cannot
speak
to
the
tardiness
of
the
civil
service
commission.
you
can
see
that
in
the
statute
that
there
is
no
guarantee
of
immediacy.
we
went
for
temporary
restraining
order
which
is
the
fastest
kind
of
relief
to
get
the
man
reinstated
on
the
grounds
that
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
repeatedly
this
court
has
ruled
that
1983
does
not
require
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
particularly
not
where
the
administrative
remedies
are
so
inadequate
as
they
are
here
and
indeed
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes,
that
is
certainly
is
true.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
they
are
--
we
are
talking
about
a
couple
of
things..
first
of
all
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
we
are
asking
for
expungement
of
the
man’s
record
and
we
are
also
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
procedures
which
were
used
to
suspend
him
are
unconstitutional.
procedures
which
in
their
reply
brief
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
i
would
certainly
never
represent
that
my
client
might
get
in
trouble
again
but
your
honor
the
continued
maintenance
of
the
summary
suspension
procedures
are
inherently
capable
of
repetition
by
the
basis
of
a
review
because
they
apply
only
to
short
suspensions
and
by
the
time
you
get
an
appeal,
particularly
to
the
supreme
court,
the
suspension
time
is
over.
any
suspension
of
more
than
30
days
calls
into
play
the
protective
procedures
of
the
illinois
statute
so
that
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
a
prior
hearing?
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
i
think
that
you
run
into
a
de
minimis
situation
there.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
there
are
suspensions
or
temporary
deprivation,
so
short
and
so
brief
in
their
nature
in
effect
that
you
might
have
a
de
minimis
situation
in
which
case
the
due
process
protections
would
not
attach.
now,
this
was
a
wage,
an
earning,
a
fairly
decent
living
so
that
you
might
think
that
even
a
week’s
pay
deprivation
would
be
serious
enough
to
call
the
due
process
cause
into
play.
but
i
think
that
you
could
argue
that
five
days
was
de
minimis.
although
in
goss
versus
lopez,
this
court
held
that
ten
days
was
not
de
minimis.
so,
but
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
draw
the
line
at
some
very
short
period.
yes.
by
selecting
29
days
for
lieutenant
muscare’s
suspension,
the
fire
department
suspended
him
for
the
longest
possible
time
without
according
him
the
statutory
protections
available
under
illinois
law
for
suspensions
of
over
30
days,
they
are
substantial
protective
prior
procedures
but
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
and
i
am
--
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
were
not
under
the
statute
entitled
to
do
as
they
did.
however,
they
have
contented
that
they
are
undertaking
with
regard
to
lieutenant
muscare
was
somehow
and
done
in
great
good
faith
and
the
greatest
of
tolerance
and
i
think
that
selection
of
29
days
which
has
no
calendar
or
any
kind
of
inherent
integrity
to
suspend
him
on
when
any
suspension
of
over
30
days
would
have
called
very
different
procedures
into
play
is
an
indication
of
their
desire
to
be
as
summary
as
possible
with
him.
at
that
time,
the
really
peculiar
thing
about
it
is
that
chief
morgan
had,
according
to
the
record
told
acting
chief
fire
marshal
foley
about
lieutenant
muscare,
something
about
him
we
do
not
know
what,
in
december
and
chief
foley
had
determined
that
he
would
not
suspend
lieutenant
muscare
in
december.
lieutenant
muscare
worked
through
his
job
fighting
fires
and
wearing
his
mask
according
to
his
un-rebutted
testimony
without
incident.
two-and-a-half
months
later,
acting
chief
fire
marshal
foley
changed
his
mind
and
said
that
--
decided
that
he
would
suspend
lieutenant
muscare.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
your
honor,
it
is
--
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
is
not
confronted
with
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
on
the
issue
of
the
personal
appearance
rule.
the
personal
appearance
where
the
petitioner
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes.
the
petitioner
has
argued
that
the
personal
appearance
rule
is
constitutional.
they
dropped
these
proceedings.
they
have
contended
that
it
is
justified
by
safety.
we
think
it
is
--
the
amicus
curie
have
pointed
out
in
their
brief
that
the
safety
justification
simply
is
not
supported
by
the
facts
in
the
record..
but
in
any
case
that
the
procedures
used
in
this
case
with
this
permanent
public
employee
are
so
arbitrary
that
they
represent
a
level
that
is
below
even
in
most
rudimentary
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause
and
that
they
cannot
be
sustained
and
accordingly
we
would
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
well,
there
is.
in
petitioner's
reply
brief,
they
specifically
represent
that
the
rules
were
changed
only
for
purposes
of
complying
with
the
seventh
circuit’s
decision
in
this
case
last
may
and
that
they
could
not
say
whether
that
they
had
it
done
it
specifically
for
that
purpose
that
they
waiting
for
this
court
to
make
a
determination,
that
they
could
not
say
whether
or
not
they
were
going
to
change
them
back.
so
we
have
an
indication
from
the
very
people
that
were
responsible
for
the
change
that
they
are
seriously
considering
changing
them
back.
in
addition
to
the
--
they
specifically
say
in
their
brief
on
page
12,
reply
brief
on
page
12,
at
least
until
the
issues
raised
had
been
settled
by
this
court,
this
procedural
change
was
adopted
as
interim
measure.
so,
we
have
that
and
of
course
we
are
making
a
constitutional
claim
and
we
are
asking
for
backpay
and
for
expungement
of
his
file,
and
you
know,
42
u.s.c.
1983
does
provide
that
we
are
properly
in
the
federal
courts.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
we
have
only
started
living
with
the
new
rules,
so
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
on
the
whole,
although
we
never
--
we
--
again
you
know
since
we
do
not
know
what
was
involved,
since
we
had
got
such
an
inadequate
notice,
we
do
not
know
what
we
would
have
needed
because
we
never
found
out
exactly
what
it
was
that
the
fire
department
had
in
mind,
but
in
any
case
--
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
i
think
it
varies
from
case
--
from
one
fact
situation
to
another
as
i
pointed
out
the
--
there
might
be
a
situation
in
which
for
example,
a
criminal
conduct
was
alleged
in
which
the
person
might
want
to
bring
an
alibi
witness
or
something
like
that.
so
i
think
that
it
really
it
is
--
as
this
court
has
so
many
times
ruled
that
should
be
flexible.
i
think
these
are
a
very
good
start.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
no.
that
is
right.
i
think
that
lieutenant
muscare
would
have
faired
just
fine
over
this
regulation.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
in
so
far
as
i
can
judge
from
the
notice
that
i
got.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
how
can
i
do
that?
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes.
i
am
asking
for
29
days
backpay
and
for
expungement
of
his
record
as
this
kind
of
thing
is,
you
know,
permanent
civil
servant’s
record
is
very
significant
to
it.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
not
necessarily.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
they
have
the
power
to
issue
those
remedies,
but
we
would
be
going
on
a
substantive
issue
with
inadequate
notice
and
bearing
a
burden
of
proof.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
r.
hirshman
thank
you
your
honor.
