justice
lewis
f.
powell,

exactly
what
issue
do
you
consider
to
be
before
us
on
this
appeal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
due
process
issue
and
the
substantive
validity
of
the
beard
regulation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals,
the
case
was
remanded
for
a
due
process
hearing
then
that
would
be
the
only
issue
we
need
to
address
here,
i
take
it,
if
the
court
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you
think
we
should
go
ahead
and
address
the
substantive
due
process
issue
that
was
not
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
respondent
did
not
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
are
you
making
that
point?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
urge
that
in
this
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
you
are
presenting
three
issues?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
addition
to
having
a
beard
that
appeared
to
violate
the
regulation,
the
respondent
declined
to
obey
an
express
order,
did
he
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
thought
the
order
was
to
put
the
gas
mask
on
and
he
refused
to
do
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
was
a
mask
drill,
was
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
he
did
not
put
the
mask
on?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
ms.
hirshman,
may
i
interrupt
just
a
minute,
please
maâ€™am.
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
in
effect
the
illinois
statute
allows
suspension
for
up
to
30
days
without
a
hearing.
let
us
assume
the
statute
required
a
hearing
if
the
suspension
exceeded
five
days,
would
that
be
valid
in
your
opinion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
no
hearing
at
all,
but
if
the
suspension
were
only
for
five
days?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
five
days
would
probably
be
alright?
