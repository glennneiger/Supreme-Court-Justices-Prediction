justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
what
you
just
said
about
the
issue
that
would
have
been
presented
to
the
arbitrator
had
there
been
arbitration.
it
would
not
have
been
as
i
understand,
whether
the
contract
prohibited
the
strike,
but
whether
assuming
the
contract
prohibited
the
strike,
the
strike
could
go
forward?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
the
issue
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
union
defeat
the
injunction
then
by
saying,
we
concede
your
interpretation
of
the
contract,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
arbitrable
issue.
we
agree
that
it
prohibits
what
we
are
doing,
but
we
are
going
to
do
it
anyway.
then
what
would
you
have
an
injunction
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
i
am
still
troubled
by
trying
to
understand
precisely
what
issue
would
be
arbitrated.
if
the
union
conceded
that
the
no
strike
clause
was
applicable
and
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
well,
maybe
you
would
arbitrate
the
issue
of
remedy,
but
if
you
have
entered
a
boys
market
injunction,
pending
the
arbitration
and
everybody
is
at
work,
what
issue
could
there
be
with
respect
to
remedy?
there
is
no
issue
as
to
liability
because
they
concede
the
clause
applies.
what
issue
as
to
remedy
would
be
presented?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
been
enjoined.
you
have
gotten
the
relief,
you
asked
for
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
24
hours
notice
and
you
ran
into
a
court
and
got
your
injunction
before
anybody
left
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
have
conceded
under
my
hypothesis.
so
what
is
the
need
for
an
injunction
in
aid
of
arbitration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
should
the
court
do,
vacate
the
injunction
and
then
they
could
go
on
strike.
i
have
a
terrible
difficulty
understanding
precisely
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
theory
of
the
relief
would
be
your
enjoining
of
breach
of
contract.
you
are
not
getting
an
injunction
in
aid
of
arbitration.
would
that
not
be
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
your
position
is
that
you
are
entitled
to
an
injunction
against
the
strike
and
breach
of
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
case
is
turn
on
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause
rather
than
the
scope
of
the
no
strike
clause?
i
do
not
think
you
finally
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
another
question.
i
think
i
understand
your
position,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
if
the
matter
had
been
submitted
to
arbitration
while
the
strike
was
pending
and
while
the
arbitration
was
still
in
process,
the
union
had
said
to
the
company,
the
men
will
stay
out
and
strike
unless
you
withdraw
the
arbitration.
then
i
would
say.
i
would
assume
you
would
say
it
will
be
appropriate
to
issue
the
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
supposing
instead
of
that,
you
would
let
the
arbitration
process
run
to
a
conclusion.
there
have
been
a
word
against
you.
could
you
then
have
kept
your
men
out
without
there
being
an
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
let
the
arbitration
process
run
its
course
and
an
award
had
been
entered
saying
the
company
is
correct
that
no
strike
clause
applies,
would
the
injunction
then
have
been
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
you
say
they
should
come
out?
i
understand
they
have
to.
