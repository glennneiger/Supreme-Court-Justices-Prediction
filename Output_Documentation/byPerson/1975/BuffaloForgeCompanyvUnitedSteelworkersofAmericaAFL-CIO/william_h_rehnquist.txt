justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
is
the
no
strike
clause
here
had
been
absolutely
plain
on
its
face,
so
that
it
was
clear
the
union
was
breaching
it
by
engaging
in
this
sympathy
strike.
would
your
case
be
stronger
or
weaker
for
the
issuance
of
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
effect
that
any
strike
that
is
a
breach
of
contract
in
effect
whether
it
is
a
breach
of
the
unionâ€™s
no
strike
clause
can
be
enjoined?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
the
arbitration
proceed
here
as
you
envision
it?
the
union
has
presumably
enjoin
from
striking
and
then
you
go
to
arbitration
as
to
whether
or
not
they
have
the
right
to
engage
in
the
strike.
what
sort
of
remedy
could
the
arbitrator
prescribe
in
that
situation,
where
you
are
talking
about
a
kind
of
conduct
that
has
never
taken
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
union
has
never
gone
on
strike,
why
would
there
be
any
back
to
work
order,
if
the
union
is
enjoined
from
strike?
