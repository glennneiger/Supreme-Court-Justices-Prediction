(a),
i
think
(inaudible)
in
the
petition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
taking
is
there
or
is
there
not
a
determination
either
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
article
26
does
not
reach,
does
not
make
arbitrable
this
dispute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
no
such
holding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
was
such
a
holding,
would
you
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
then
i
gather
that
as
an
interpretation
of
the
clause
which
we
are
not
likely
to
review
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
that
the
court
did
not
decide
it
or
it
did
not
reach
dispute?
did
it
decide
that
it
did
reach
the
dispute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
decide
that
as
am
initial
question
in
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
it
mean
in
18
(a)
in
the
very
first
sentence
in
the
district
court
opinion,
“the
boys
market
standards
do
not
apply
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
arbitrable
grievance
between
the
parties.”
now,
is
that
or
is
it
not
an
interpretation
of
section
26
as
for
the
reach
of
the
obligation
to
arbitrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
conceding
that
though
mr.
cohen,
the
court
properly
stated
i
thought
at
17
(a),
the
third
thing
that
the
court
must
find
that
both
parties
are
contractually
bound
to
arbitrate
the
underlying
grievance
with
the
cause
of
strike
which
is
what
boys
market
said
and
i
do
not
know
why
that
sentence
is
not
to
be
read
as
an
interpretation
of
26
that
this
dispute
is
not
made
arbitrable
by
paragraph
26,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
paragraph
25?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
within
the
reach
of
the
arbitration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
cohen,
i
take
it
the
parties
could
have
written
a
provision
for
arbitration
which
would
have
reached
this
far
as
situation,
could
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
has
been
done,
but
in
case
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
every
arbitration
clause
is
limited
to
matters
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you
say
whatever
may
have
been
the
case,
these
parties
would
not
agree
to
an
arbitration
clause
which
reached
this
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
i
be
correct
in
suggesting
that
the
arbitration
trilogy,
all
had
as
a
basic
underpinning.
now,
that
rather
than
resorting
to
strikes
and
other
economic
combat
wetness,
the
notion
was
we
should
encourage
arbitrations
so
that
production
will
continue
while
his
grievances
are
resolved
in
arbitration,
would
that
be
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
what?
when
you
get
around
the
boys
market,
assuming
we
have
a
situation
here,
in
which
as
you
have
conceded
as
i
understand
it,
the
employer
had
made
the
grievance
of
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
i
say.
suppose
he
had
then
it
would
you
say
be
arbitrable
under
the
clause.
nevertheless,
you
suggest
that
norris-laguardia
prohibits
an
injunction
in
this
situation
against
the
strike
because
the
very
issue
to
be
decided
in
arbitration
is
whether
the
strike
is
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
well,
that
makes
the
underpinning
of
the
steel
workers
trilogy
meaningless
in
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
are
going
right
on
with
the
interrupted
production,
that
is
what
the
effect
of
the
strike
is
while
arbitration
is
going
on,
but
all
you
wind
up
with
the
strike,
they
say
is
lawful
or
unlawful
and
if
the
arbitrator
decides
it
is
unlawful
as
i
understand
you,
there
would
be
nothing
that
the
employer
could
do
about
it.
at
that
juncture
he
could
not
get
an
injunction
even
then
if
you
want
to
continue
with
it,
could
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
could
he?
suppose
you
continue
the
strike.
the
arbitration
is
completed
and
the
arbitrator
concludes
that
it
was
a
violation
of
contract,
if
they
review
that,
can
the
employer
can
at
that
juncture
get
an
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
you
is
that
this
very
thing
is
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
employer
had
made
it
such
by
filing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
creates
the
grievance,
of
course,
the
strike
created
a
grievance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
very
issue,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yet
have
the
grievance
created
by
the
strike
could
have
been
made
arbitrable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
he
continue
that
is
not
on
the
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance
after
it
has
been
made
arbitrable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
arbitration
as
a
means
of
continuing
production
does
not
accomplish
that
in
this
case
is
you
suggest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
reason
that
that
was
a
method
of
continuing
production?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
that
is
the
whole
point,
but
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
you
was
on
the
premise
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
this
very
strike
could
have
been
made
a
grievance
by
the
employer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
then
it
would
have
had
to
go
to
arbitration
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
yet
you
are
suggesting
that
while
arbitration
would
and
you
would
then
have
to
participate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nevertheless,
you
could
continue
the
strike
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
not
withstanding
the
arbitration,
there
is
an
interruption
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
whole
idea
of
boys
market
is
that
production
continues
while
arbitration
goes
on
and
what
you
are
saying
is
production
in
this
situation
does
not
have
to
continue,
the
strike
can
go
on
while
arbitration
proceeds
and
if
the
employer
has
any
right
to
enjoin
it.
it
has
to
be,
he
has
the
wait
until
the
arbitrator
finds
in
his
favor,
that
the
strike
is
illegal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
you
should
prevail
on
that
ground
here
that
we
never
reach
the
thing
you
and
i
have
been
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

out
mr.
cohen

opinion,
