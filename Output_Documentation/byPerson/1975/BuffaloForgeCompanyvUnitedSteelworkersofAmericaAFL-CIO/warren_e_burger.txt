we
will
resume
at
1
o’clock.[lunch
break]
mr.
cohen,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
no
underlining
of
the
arbitration
clause
here
even
in
a
symbolic
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
because
you
are
saying
there
is
nothing
to
arbitrate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen,
to
pursue
justice
white’s
question
about
scope
of
arbitration
clauses,
could
you
have
a
valid
arbitration
clause
that
provided
that
if
any
strike
or
lock-out
occurred
during
the
pendency
of
the
arbitration,
the
arbitration
board
could
impose
and
asses
a
fine
of
$1,000.00
a
day
on
the
offending
party,
could
that
be
enforceable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
other
question.
was
the
union
undertaking
to
exercise
economic
coercion
on
the
employer
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
their
own
benefit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
answer
mr.
justice
white
when
he
asked
you
if
that
was
the
meaning
of
that
clause
was
open
to
arbitration?
i
think
he
asked
you
that
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
strike
would
go
on
in
the
meantime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
a
purpose
in
arbitration
if
that
were
the
issue
raised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
separate
that
from
the
fact
of
the
strike
when
you
concede
there
would
be
the
right
to
arbitrate
the
question
of
their
right
to
strike?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
your
position.
you
want
to
make
them
two
distinct
problems.
what
i
am
probing
at
is
how
are
they
two
distinct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
