mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
while
significant,
will
not
i
am
afraid,
be
stimulating
to
the
court
as
the
issues
case
argued
just
prior
this
or
in
the
case
argued
yesterday,
but
i
will
do
my
best.
the
company
is
a
manufacturer
in
buffalo,
new
york
and
in
1974,
the
steel
workers
union
was
certified
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
the
company’s
office
employees.
at
the
same
time,
the
union
was
also
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
the
company’s
factory
workers
and
had
been
for
many,
many
years.
the
factory
workers
have
been
covered
by
collective
bargaining
contracts
between
the
steel
workers
and
the
company
going
back
into
the
late
1940s
and
early
1950s.
those
contracts,
among
other
terms
and
conditions,
contained
broad
no
strike
clauses,
two
in
fact,
a
very
broad
definition
of
what
matters
to
be
resolved
through
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
and
at
the
time
of
the
instant
dispute,
contained
provisions
allowing
both
union
and
the
employer
to
use
the
grievance
procedure
to
resolve
items
of
policy
or
general
contract
interpretation
issues.
in
the
latter
part
of
1974,
the
steel
workers
in
the
midst
of
bargaining
the
first
contract
for
the
office
and
technical
workers
set
up
picket
lines
around
the
company’s
premises
in
the
buffalo,
new
york
area
and
conducted
a
strike
against
the
buffalo
forge
company.
the
office
workers
and
the
factory
workers
worked
in
the
same
buildings
with
the
offices
generally
being
in
the
front
and
the
factory
area
being
in
the
back,
but
used
common
entrances.
the
pickets
were
set
up
at
these
entrances
and
at
all
other
places
surrounding
the
company’s
premises.
four
days
later,
that
is
four
days
after
the
picketing
was
established
the
respondent
steel
workers
directed
the
local
union
officers
of
the
factory
local
unions
to
honor
the
office-worker
picket
lines
which
the
steel
workers
had
established
and
to
instruct
the
employees
who
were
members
of
the
factory
workers
local
unions
and
members
of
the
steel
workers
to
also
respect
those
office-worker
picket
lines.
that
afternoon,
the
company
having
heard
of
a
work
stoppage
plan,
fired
of
a
telegram
to
the
steel
workers,
protesting
that
the
rumored
work
stoppage
will
be
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause,
contained
in
the
factory
worker
contract
and
offered
to
immediately
arbitrate
or
go
to
arbitration
over
any
issue
which
had
caused
this
potential
work
stop.
that
telegram
was
ignored
and
the
work
stoppage
commenced
the
very
next
morning.
the
company
attempted
to
obtain
injunctive
relief
under
the
theory
of
boys
markets
from
the
federal
district
court.
its
application
for
temporary
restraining
order
and
the
preliminary
injunction
were
denied,
essentially
on
the
theory
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
decision
in
the
amstar
case
interpreting
this
court’s
decision
in
boys
market
as
having
no
application
to
any
breach
of
contract
strike,
save
the
one
situation
where
the
strike
is
triggered
by
an
ongoing
or
live
grievance
between
the
union
and
employer
party
to
the
contract.
an
appeal
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
resulted
in
affirmance
of
the
district
court’s
decision
on
essentially
the
same
grounds
that
i
have
just
summarized.
the
strike,
even
if
it
were
a
breach
of
contract,
had
to
be
literally
over
or
triggered
by
some
ongoing
live
grievance
between
the
contracting
parties.
it
is
our
position
generally,
stated
at
the
outset,
that
the
requested
relief
falls
squarely
in
the
pathway
of
this
court’s
decisions
in
boys
markets,
in
gateway
coal,
as
well
as
those
decisions
while
they
involved
damage
actions,
also
indicate
the
court’s
intention
and
purpose
of
finding
ways
to
meaningfully
enforce
both
the
no
strike
clause
as
well
as
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract.
this
is
not
as
a
matter
of
premise,
this
is
not
the
first
time
this
court
has
considered
a
sympathy
strike
situation.
the
case
is
build
as
one
which
is
the
first
sympathy
strike
case
to
appear
before
this
court,
but
it
is
not.
one
week
after
this
court’s
decision
in
sinclair,
majority
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
in
yellow
transit
systems
versus
teamsters,
a
case
very
simply
which
involved
a
union
and
an
employer
of
an
ongoing
collective
bargaining
relationship.
the
union
advised
the
employers
in
that
case
that
it
was
going
the
set
about
organizing
the
company’s
office
workforce.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yellow
transit
systems
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
it
is
it
in
the
reply
brief
as
also
mentioned
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
yellow
transit
systems
is
mentioned
on
page
2
or
page
3,
excuse
me
of
the
reply
brief
and
on
several
pages
of
the
respondent’s
brief,
in
particular
page
9
of
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
the
significance
of
that
old
case
since
the
court
will
recall
that
the
reversal
was
a
one
word
that
majority
opinion
citing
the
court’s
decision
in
sinclair
was
in
our
view
the
concurring
opinion,
the
special
concurring
opinion
written
by
justice
brennan
and
in
which
the
other
dissenters
in
sinclair
joined,
in
which
the
concurring
justices
said
that
the
only
reason
they
were
concurring
in
the
result
was
because
there
was
no
agreement
between
the
parties
to
arbitrate
any
dispute.
there
was
no
clause
in
the
contract
providing
for
any
internal
arbitration
over
any
dispute
between
the
parties.
so
this
is
not
the
first
sympathy
strike
case
that
has
come
before
this
court.
as
you
might
suspect,
your
honors,
we
have
put
it
in
a
formula,
that
is
if
teamsters
versus
yellow
transit
is
to
sinclair
as
monongahela,
the
fourth
circuit
case
is
to
boys
market
than
the
extension,
i
would
say
extension,
it
is
just
the
redundancy,
that
is
our
position
in
buffalo
forge
claiming
that
we
were
entitled
to
an
injunction,
has
the
same
relationship
to
boys
market
as
monongahela
as
to
boys
market
and
as
we
think
the
concurring
opinion
in
teamsters
versus
yellow
transit
has
to
the
original
sinclair
decision.
the
respondents
claim
that
only
the
narrow
holding
of
this
court’s
decision
in
boys
markets
applies
and
that
is
continuation
of
the
requirement
that
the
strike
must
be
literally
over
a
live
grievance.
its
position
in
our
view
is
essentially
that
norris-laguardia
is
more
than
alive
and
well.
it
is
the
dominant
theme
of
federal
regulation
of
labor
management
relationships.
we
could
not
disagree
more
and
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
establish
that
norris-laguardia
does
not
invariably
bar
injunctive
relief,
for
example,
the
unlawful
strike.
legislative
history
referred
to
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
our
main
brief
indicate
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
bar
injunctions
against
unlawful
strikes.
is
this
strike
in
the
buffalo
forge
case
unlawful?
it
is
our
contention
that
by
resorting
to
strike,
given
the
contract
terms,
that
by
resorting
to
strike
without
first
arbitrating
the
disputed
right
of
the
union
to
engage
in
conduct
prohibited
by
the
contract
that
it
violated
its
duty
to
arbitrate
which
it
had
freely
given
in
the
contract,
violated
its
duty
to
arbitrate
without
irrigating
to
itself
the
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
especially
in
this
case
because
a
dispute
arose
the
day
before
the
work
stoppage
when
the
union
directed
its
local
unions
to
respect
the
picket
lines
and
the
company
disputed
the
union’s
right
to
issue
such
an
instruction.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
the
issue
would
have
been,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
union’s
directive,
the
steel
workers’
directives
to
their
local
union
officials
and
members
to
honor
the
office-workers
picket
lines
was
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause
of
that
contract
and
that
the
arbitrator
was
empowered
to
determine
the
union’s
disagreement
with
the
company’s
position,
that
is
whether
the
strike,
the
orders
and
the
ensuing
work
stoppage
were
in
fact
a
violation
of
the
no
strike
pledges
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
neither
concluded
that
the
arbitration
clause
went
to
the
issue
of
aribitrability
of
the
issue
that
i
have
just
described
to
justice
stevens.
there
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
they
said
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
arbitrable
dispute
which
would
permit
the
granting
of
an
injunction
since
it
would
not
be
an
aid
of
the
arbitration
processes.
the
theory
espoused
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
only
if
the
strike
is
triggered
by
a
live
grievance
can
it
be
said
that
an
injunction
is
appropriate
because
the
union
is
trying
to
evade
or
avoid
its
obligation
to
arbitrary.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
oh!
very
much
so.
in
fact
this
court
has
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
in
the
appendix
--
well,
in
the
appendix
on
page
16,
there
is
the
no
strike
clause
and
on
page
17
paragraph
26
of
the
agreement,
there
is
the
definition
of
arbitrable
grievance
and
any
dispute
or
any
trouble
of
any
kind
arising
in
the
plant,
there
was
in
the
district
court’s
decision
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
there
is
no
such
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
there
is
a
statement
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that
the
arbitration
clause
did
not
cover
this
dispute,
then
in
no
way
could
an
injunction
be
in
aid
of
the
arbitration
process.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
it
did
not
decide
that
either.
it
decided
that
looking
at
the
district
court’s
decision
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
you
do
not.
in
fact,
i
think
in
reading
respondent’s
brief
that
there
is
an
essentially
an
acknowledgment
that
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
a
no
strike
clause
is
arbitrable.
footnote
6,
among
other
things
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
goes
on
at
great
length
about
the
issues
of
fact
and
issues
of
fact
in
law
that
arise
under
contracts.
under
contract
such
as
this
one,
this
is
the
footnote
6
of
the
respondent’s
brief,
i
guess
it
is
buff-colored,
and
many
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
applying
the
principles
of
the
trilogy
are
to
the
effect
that
a
disputed
application
or
disputed
exception
to
a
no
strike
clause
is
presumptively
arbitrable.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
would
say
it
would
be
stronger,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
it
is
very
important
the
court
understand
the
company’s
position
in
this
case.
a
contract
which
contains
the
most
--
of
we
had
in
a
buffalo
forge
contract,
no
arbitration
provisions
whatsoever,
only
a
clause
which
among
the,
in
addition
of
the
language
already
expressed
said
and
further
more
there
shall
be
no
sympathy
strike
whatsoever.
if
the
injunction
in
this
case
is
not
an
assistance
to
the
arbitration
process
by
which
the
parties
voluntary
agree
that
any
dispute
that
they
had
as
defined
in
the
agreement
would
be
resolved
by
arbitration
without
resort
to
301
litigation,
then
there
is
no
injunction.
and
so
we
are
not
here
asking
this
court
to
adapt
what
i
regard
as
a
very
substantial
expansion
of
boys
market
that
a
mere
request
of
the
employer
given
a
clear
no
strike
pledge
that
all
the
court
has
to
do
is
make
a
determination
whether
the
contract
has
been
violated
and
if
so
enforce
the
no
strike
clause.
that
was
never
as
far
as
i
know
has
been
the
policy
of
this
court.
it
is
not
the
policy,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reach
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
so,
a
simple
enforcement
of
the
no
strike
clause
is
not
what
is
at
issue,
at
least
it
is
not
the
main
issue
that
the
petitioner
is
raising
in
this
case.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
absent
in
arbitration
clause.
if
mr.
justice
stewart
is
saying
that
there
really
is
no
issue
of
fact
for
an
arbitrator,
no
decision
for
an
arbitrator
to
render,
it
is
our
contention
of
course
that
the
court
should
be
making
no
determinations
of
facts
aside
from
determining
whether
the
arbitration
process
is
broad
enough
in
scope
to
cover
the
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
once
it
makes
a
determination
that
the
clause
certainly
is
broad
enough,
applying
the
presumptions
of
the
trilogy,
its
business
is
finished
and
what
the
respondent
is
in
effect
saying
to
us
is
that
we
have
as
the
union,
we
have
a
right
to
strike
for
a
while.
we
have
a
right
to
strike
while
the
arbitration
process
that
we
have
committed
ourself
to
is
being
administered.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
then
you
would
get
an
injunction
because
the
union
stipulation
in
court
is
still
not
what
we
should
be
doing
of
course
is
enforcing
a
no
strike
clause
without
any
enforcement
of
the
arbitration
process.
we
should
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
most
certainly
it
should
be
for
remedy.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
in
fact
mr.
justice
white
your
decision
in
drake
bakeries
fits
buffalo
forge
to
a
tee.
we
have
in
drake
bakeries
a
requirement
that
arbitration
rather
than
the
federal
courts
would
have
made
the
determination
of
liability
as
well
as
damages
and
in
the
drake
bakeries
decision
you
commented,
speaking
for
the
majority
that
there
was
another
case
that
came
of
the
second
circuit,
in
which
there
was
as
broad
an
arbitration
clause
as
the
one
you
were
dealing
with
in
drake
and
that
was
markel
electric.
and
writing
so
many
briefs
in
this
case
one
has,
i
have
had
to
find,
dig
deeper
and
deeper
for
my
own
enjoyment
in
presenting
this
argument
and
i
had
to
smile
when
i
noticed
the
quotation
of
the
markel
electric
case
because
it
was
my
life
partner
edward
flirty
who
negotiated
both
the
original
markel
electric
contract
in
the
original
buffalo
forge
contract
which
had
identical
descriptions
of
arbitrable
grievance
that
you
will
find
in
paragraph
26
of
the
current
contract.
so
that
arbitration
must
be
used
both
for
determination
of
liability
and
for
determination
of
any
penalties,
if
there
are
any
to
be
paid.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
injunction
as
well
as
damages.
the
fifth
circuit
for
example
in
the
decision
involving
u.s.
steel
and
the
mine
workers
made
it
quite
clear
that
if
an
arbitrator
issued
a
back
to
work
order
as
part
of
the
arbitration
process,
that
that
court
would
enforce
the
arbitrator’s
award
or
by
having
it
confirmed
at
the
employer’s
request.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
if
the
injunction
occurred
before
a
strike
took
place?
i
must
have
misunderstood
the
fact
proposition.
the
problem
here
is
that
in
many,
many
cases,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
employer
or
the
union
is
about
to
do
something,
for
example
closing
down
a
plant
because
of
adverse
economic
conditions
or
the
employer
is
going
to
change
the
hours
of
work,
it
is
usually
not
a
surprise
to
the
union,
there
are
opportunities
to
utilize
grievance
procedure,
there
are
opportunities
to
attempt
the
resolve
the
matter
in
advance.
as
indicated
by
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
union
is
not
likely
to
give
the
employer
advance
notice
of
its
intentions
to
engage
in
a
sympathy
strike.
in
this
case,
in
fact,
we
had
only
but
a
few
hours
notice
of
the
rumored
strike
plan.
but
all
the
employer
was
able
to
do
was
to
fire
of
its
telegram
saying
if
there
is
some
problem,
we
are
willing
to
arbitrate
it
and
besides
you
are
violating
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
have
to
under
the
circumstances
appeal
to
federal
district
court
for
expeditious
relief.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
the
union
is
not
on
strike
at
this
time.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
but
the
strike
started
that
was
stopped
by
the
injunction?
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
there
will
only
be
the
academic
question
of
whether
the
union
is
threatened
conduct
was
a
violation.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
upon
the
concession,
there
would
be
none.
i
would
not
see
what
the
need
would
be
in
aid
of
the
arbitration
process?
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
if
we
appeared
before,
let
us
say
we
have
a
threatened
strike,
a
sympathy
strike
and
if
in
response
to
that,
the
employer
appeared
before
a
federal
district
court
judge
with
the
appropriate
papers
and
the
union
appeared
and
said
there
is
no
issue
for
arbitration;
we
agree
the
employers’
right,
if
we
did
strike
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract
and
the
judge
looked
at
me
and
said,
mr.
cohen
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
if
the
union
were
despite
that
exchange
in
front
of
federal
district
court
judge
going
to
resume
picketing
a
day
or
two
later,
then
i
imagine
i
get
rather
expeditious
relief
from
the
federal
district
court
judge
in
view
of
that
assurance
that
the
union
was
expressing
to
the
district
court
judge
if
there
was
no
reason
for
the
strike.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
if
the
union
agreed
that
a
strike
would
violate
the
contract,
yet
it
insisted
on
its
right
to
strike
anyway,
then
i
would
say
the
court
would
be
within
its
rights
under
the
guidelines
of
boys
market
to
issue
the
injunction
because
the
union
does
not
mean
what
it
says,
if
it
is
insisting
that
a
strike
would
breach
the
contract
and
has
right
to
breach
the
agreement.
there
is
still
a
dispute
between
the
employer
and
the
union
as
to
whether
the
no
strike
clause
applies
to
the
union’s
threatened
or
actual
conduct
and
that
should
be
resolved
by
an
arbitrator
and
the
status
quo
in
the
fact
situation
you
mention,
should
be
maintained
while
the
parties
expeditiously
decide
whether
a
strike
would
be
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
what
remedy
if
any
the
arbitrator
will
allow.
if
i
tell
you
that
there
is
no
violation
of
a
no
strike
clause,
yet
i
insist
on
my
right
to
strike
anyway,
then
there
is
obviously
a
continuing
dispute
between
the
parties
about
whether
you
can
strike
despite
the
existence
of
a
man
against
strike
contained
in
the
agreement.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
the
union
has
disputed
that.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
currently
so.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
it
is
not
an
interpretation
of
paragraph
26.
it
is
a
literal
interpretation
of
this
court’s
decision
in
boys
markets
that
there
was
no
arbitrable
grievance
which
was
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
complete
opinion
as
well
as
the
court
of
appeals
decision
shows
us
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
did
not
find
that
there
was
no
arbitrable
dispute,
but
that
there
was
no
arbitrable
dispute
which
would
support
an
injunction.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
believe
that
is
the
meaning
of
that
sentence.
i
know
that
that
the
respondent
has
argued
that
that
is
a
finding
of
fact,
but
if
that
is
a
finding
of
fact,
it
flies
in
the
face
of
every
decision
whether
it
is
a
damage
action
or
and
injunction
action
issued
by
this
court
and
it
is
not
a
proper
interpretation
of
what
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
have
decided.
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
reserve
whatever
few
moments
i
have
left
for
a
rebuttal.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
respondent
union’s
position
that
no
boys
market
injunction
is
proper
here
for
two
separate
discreet
reasons.
number
one
this
was
not
a
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance
and
number
two,
there
was
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
mr.
justice
brennan,
what
we
mean
by
that
is
that
the
dispute
between
the
united
steel
workers
of
america
and
the
buffalo
forge
company
which
lead
to
the
sympathy
strike
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
term
or
condition
of
employment
which
was
subject
to
the
grievance
arbitration
machinery
of
section
26.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
i
would
say
yes
to
that,
but
i
do
not
want
to
mislead
the
court
down
the
line.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
to
strike
itself,
albeit
not
over
an
arbitrable
grievance,
creates
an
independent
arbitrable
grievance.
the
answer
to
the
latter
question
is
yes,
under
the
no
strike
provision
of
the
contract.
a
grievance
ultimately
is
presented
which
is
available
to
the
arbitrator,
but
we
want
to
emphasize
that
the
company,
while
invoking
the
pro-arbitration
policy
of
section
301
never
even
invoked
the
arbitration
procedure.
they
never
even
filed
a
grievance
alleging
that
the
strike
itself
and
here
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
legality
of
the
strike
itself
was
in
fact
a
breach
of
the
no
strike
clause.
we
do
not
think
that
is
the
touchstone.
the
touchstone
we
maintain
is
that
one
has
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
threshold
question.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
the
case
here
before
us
follows
in
our
analysis
strictly
along
the
lines
of
the
boys
markets
decision
of
this
court.
in
boys
markets,
the
parties
had
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
included
a
provision
that
the
adjustment
of
all
grievances,
all
disputes
concerning
the
meaning,
application
or
interpretation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
resolved
through
final
and
binding
arbitration.
in
the
face
of
that
particular
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
once
again
mr.
justice
white,
it
depends
on
the
language
of
the
contract.
in
this
contract
for
example,
it
is
clear
that
the
employer
had
a
right
to
file
a
grievance
claiming
that
the
union
strike
was
in
breach
of
a
no
strike
clause.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
with
whom?
he
would
physically
file
it
with
the
union.
that
is
right
and
then
there
is
a
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
then
call
out
a
grievance
and
then
the
procedure
which
would
then
be
triggered
would
follow
up
to
including
final
and
binding
arbitration.
in
any
event,
in
boys
markets,
the
employer
contracted
out
certain
work
which
the
union
maintained
constituted
a
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
it
was
work
which
the
union
claimed
under
the
contract
belonged
to
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
the
union
did
not
file
a
grievance.
union
did
not
file
the
grievance
arbitration
machinery
and
instead
went
out
on
strike
in
support
of
its
position
that
that
work
had
to
be
reassigned
to
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
in
the
face
of
that
strike,
the
employer
sought
an
injunction
and
this
court
was
confronted
with
the
possible
dilemma
of
on
the
one
hand
a
norris-laguardia
seemingly
absolute
ban
on
enjoining
any
strikes
and
on
the
other
hand
the
pro-arbitration
policy
as
set
forth
in
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
and
this
court
concluded
that
it
was
possible
to
accommodate
those
two
competing
and
conflicting
policies
by
writing
a
very
narrow
and
limited
intrusion
upon
the
norris-laguardia
ban
and
that
intrusion
was
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
injunction
where
the
vindication
of
the
arbitration
policy
was
at
stake.
more
particularly,
for
example
in
boys
market
what
this
meant
was
essentially
that
if
the
union
had
succeeded
in
bringing
to
bear
enough
economic
pressure
on
the
employer,
so
that
the
employer
would
capitulate
and
given
to
the
union’s
demands
by
reassigning
the
work,
the
consequence
of
that
action
by
the
union
would
have
been
to
undermine
the
entire
arbitration
process
said
this
court
in
boys
market
because
in
essence
it
would
have
taken
away
the
jurisdiction
of
the
arbitrator
and
transferred
it
into
the
industrial
warfare
that
the
whole
policy
and
procedure
of
section
301
was
designed
to
avoid.
so
said
this
court,
we
will
in
order
to
vindicate
section
301,
set
forth
certain
various
specific
requirements
and
those
requirements
of
course
petitioner
has
referred
to
as
being
literal
requirements.
we
submit
they
are
both
literal
and
they
also
capture
the
very
underlying
purpose
and
intent
of
boys
market,
namely
that
although
there
is
no
general
federal
anti-strike
policy,
and
therefore,
norris-laguardia
should
prevail
said
this
court
in
boys
market
even
where
there
is
a
breach
of
a
private
contract
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
some
additional
compelling
public
consideration
is
present.
now,
that
additional
compelling
public
consideration
was
present
said
this
court
in
boys
markets
because
the
strike
was
designed
to
undermine
and
indeed
was
undermining
arbitration
and
the
court
determined
it
would
vindicate
arbitration
by
doing
two
things:
one,
compelling
the
parties
to
in
effect
go
back
to
arbitration
and
two,
enjoining
the
strike
at
that
time.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
clearly
our
position.
our
position
and
i
think
if
you
focus
on
the
contrast
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
that
is
not
so.
what
we
are
saying
is
basically
as
follows.
that
as
contrasted
from
boys
markets
where
the
strike
was
in
fact
designed
to
obtain
capitulation
over
an
arbitrable
grievance,
over
a
term
or
condition
of
employment
about
which
the
parties
were
disputing
and
which
the
parties
had
agreed
to
submit
to
an
arbitrator
for
his
final
and
binding
decision,
that
is
boys
market.
now,
as
contrasted
from
the
situation
here,
the
union
was
out
on
strike.
there
was
no
dispute
between
the
union
and
the
employer
as
to
any
time
or
condition
of
employment
for
any
of
the
production
and
maintenance
employees.
there
was
nothing
the
employer
could
do
unlike
in
boys
market
which
would
constitute
a
concession
that
would
have
resolved
that
problem.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
imagine
that
is
possible.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
do
not
think
they,
i
think
what
they
have
written.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
correct.
some
go
beyond
that.
you
had
one
in
gateway
coal
where
we
talked
about
local
trouble
at
the
plant
as
well
as
that.
the
problem
is
though,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
when
you
are
striking
in
a
sympathy
strike
situation
there
is
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
correct
and
this
was
not
a
strength
over
an
arbitrable
grievance
in
the
district
court.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
absolutely,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
that
has
been
red
herring
in
a
sense
mr.
justice
white.
we
clearly
agree
that
and
we
agree
that
if
the
company
had
filed
the
grievance,
they
were
clearly
entitled
to
arbitration
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
no
strike
clause
had
been
breached.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
correct.
we
would
say
that
and
our
support
would
be
norris-laguardia
act
mr.
justice
white.
the
key
core
evil
that
norris-laguardia
was
designed
to
get
rid
of
was
the
enjoining
of
what
might
be
lawful
strikes
and
this
is
the
exact
posture
in
the
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
normally
not,
but
it
even
goes
farther
than
that.
let
us
look
for
example
at
boys
market.
in
boys
markets
when
this
court
ordered
the
parties
in
effect
by
remand
into
the
district
court
to
send
that
dispute
as
to
contracting
out
to
arbitration
and
at
the
same
time
enjoining
the
strike,
the
court
did
not
go
on
to
say
and
by
the
way
mr.
employer,
reinstate
that
status
quo,
turn
that
work
back
and
give
it
back
to
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
right.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
right
and
of
course
that
is
not
only
arbitration
law.
that
is
really
basically
consistent
with
the
whole
industrial
relations
reality
which
is
to
say
the
employer
acts
and
the
union
reacts
and
management
has
certain
prerogatives
and
that
is
how
it
functions.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
that
problem
is
clearly
not
here
before
us.
i
would
say
that
the
parties
have
the
opportunity.
this
court
has
held
for
example,
you
can
waive
the
right
to
strike.
we
acknowledge
if
you
have
a
clear
and
unequivocal
waiver
of
a
sympathy
strike,
you
can
do
that.
i
think
the
parties
could
in
their
collective
bargaining
relationship
reach
agreements
which
would
constitute
all
kinds
of
waivers
that
might
give
protections
to
either
one
or
both
of
the
parties
beyond
that
which
the
law
would
otherwise
entitle
them
to.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
absolutely.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
--
no
i
think
--
but
i
think
i
would
like
to
couch
it
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
would
like
to
couch
it
in
these
terms.
the
union
was
engaged
in
what
is
protected
strike
activity
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
unless
and
until
there
is
a
clear
and
unequivocal
waiver
as
contained
in
the
no
strike
clause
and
there
is
a
very
substantial
question
insofar
as
the
merits
are
concerned
here
as
to
whether
or
not
this
language,
this
just
general
statement
that
there
will
be
no
strike
in
fact
would
constitute
a
waiver
of
that
basic
fundamental
protected
right.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
said
that
--
of
course,
and
it
was
open
to
arbitration
right
here
your
honor.
in
other
words,
let
us
suppose
that
this
company
not
only
invoked
the
name
of
arbitration
as
they
are
doing
before
this
court,
but
they
actually
filed
a
grievance.
they
had
an
absolute
right
to
file
a
grievance
contending
that
that
strike
was
in
breach
of
the
no
strike
clause.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
the
strike
would
go
on
in
the
meantime
and
unless
and
until
a
strike
is
in
fact
declared
unlawful
then
we
say
that
the
core
purpose
of
norris-laguardia
demands
that
no
injunction
issue
unless
and
until
that
has
been
determined.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
if
you
are
not
striking,
i
think
you
have
to
keep
coming
back
to
the
threshold
question,
are
you
striking
over
an
arbitrable
grievance?
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
and
we
submit
that
is
the
situation
here,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
there
is,
therefore,
nothing
to
vindicate
in
terms
of
the
arbitration
policy.
the
union
was
not
trying
to
extract
any
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
because
basically,
we
are
talking
about
two
distinct
problems.
one
problem
is
when
you
strike
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
let
us
go
back
for
a
second
to
the
boys
market
analysis.
your
insistence
was
that
in
order
to
reach
an
appropriate
accommodation
that
would
not
intrude
improperly
on
norris-laguardia,
you
have
to
make
sure
that
the
strike
itself
was
over
an
arbitrable
grievance.
if
it
is
not
over
an
arbitrable
grievance
then
you
are
not
vindicating
arbitration
and
you
are
left
with
one
thing
and
one
thing
only.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
is
entitled
to
a
specific
enforcement
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
no
strike
commitment.
to
which
--
the
answer
to
that
of
course
is
norris-laguardia
precludes
that.
an
effort
was
made
to
repeal
norris-laguardia
in
section
301
of
taft-hartley
and
it
was
rejected.
so
that
you
have
to
address
in
each
one
of
these
instances
the
threshold
question,
is
that
a
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance
which
could,
in
other
words,
if
the
union
had
committed
itself
to
resolve
a
particular
problem
through
that
process
then
enjoining
the
strike
is
not
an
independent
basis.
the
injunction
just
follows
naturally
from
the
separate
public
concern
about
making
the
arbitration
policy
work.
you
do
not
have
that
here
we
maintain.
there
is
nothing
here
to
be
vindicated.
if
the
employer
had
filed
a
grievance,
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
grievance
would
not
have
been
processed
though
the
arbitration.
the
employer
acknowledges
that
in
a
sense.
the
employer’s
petition
and
all
of
its
brief
have
said
what
we
want
is
an
injunction
pending
arbitration.
we
know,
we
have
committed
ourselves
to
arbitrate
that
issue.
we
think
in
the
interim,
we
are
entitled
to
injunction,
even
though
of
course,
the
strike
still
may
be
lawful.
on
the
one
hand,
they
take
as
a
given
that
the
strike
is
unlawful,
but
on
the
other
hand
they
acknowledge
they
have
to
go
to
arbitration
and
get
a
result
from
an
arbitrator
before
they
are
in
a
position
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
would
be
right
if
we
focus
on
what
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
say
he
could
have.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
we
go
back
to
the
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
if
the
strike
itself
is
over
an
arbitrable
grievance,
there
is
no
question
that
the
boys
market
rationale
would
apply
a
fortiori
and
in
fact
an
injunction
would
be
proper.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
no
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
the
strike
itself
is
creating
a
grievance.
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
any
meaning
or
interpretation
or
application
of
the
contract.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
the
strike
created
the
grievance,
but
the
strike
itself
was
an
over
arbitrable
grievance
and
there
is
nothing
that
need
be
vindicated
here.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
the
petition
has
acknowledged
that
read
literally
at
least
this
is
not
a
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance.
what
the
petitioner
is
arguing
is
that
one
should
expand
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
could
have
been
made
arbitrable.
we
are
not
questioning
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
there
could
come
a
circumstance,
but
i
do
not
think
that
if
you
just
had
a
non-arbitrable
grievance,
let
us
suppose
you
had
excluded
from
the
arbitration
provision
a
certain
kind
of
a
dispute,
a
contracting
out
dispute
and
there
was
a
no
strike
clause
and
you
went
to
arbitration.
well,
first
of
all
if
the
union
went
out
on
strike
in
those
certain
circumstances,
it
would
not
be
an
arbitrable
grievance,
although
it
might
constitute
a
breach
of
the
no
strike
clause.
there
is
the
number
of
variables
that
you
can
have
as
to
whether
or
not
the
actual
strike
itself
is
over
an
arbitrable
grievance.
but
the
crucial
aspect
is
as
we
see
that
the
boys
market
decision
focused
on
that
essential
pre-requisite
because
absent
that
the
separate
independent
vindication
of
arbitration
was
not
present.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
the
whole
trilogy,
now
the
whole
purpose
of
the
trilogy
was
to
give
an
impetus
to
the
agreements
reached
by
the
parties
as
to
how
they
would
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
right,
but
if
they
did
not
reach
an
agreement,
in
other
words,
there
is
nothing
in
the
trilogy
that
suggests,
although
arbitration
is
the
preferred
method
that
the
parties
are
precluded
from
agreeing
certain
subjects
will
not
be
subject
to
arbitration
or
that
you
cannot
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
right.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
absolutely.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
am
saying
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
am
saying
that
at
that
stage,
with
a
final
and
binding
arbitration
award
once
again
a
court
would
be
faced
with
balancing
the
competing
policies
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
on
the
one
hand
and
301
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
in
this
instance,
that
is
clear.
in
this
instance,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
you
got
to
have,
you
got
two
deficiencies,
not
only
do
you
not
have
a
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance,
but
you
have
not
even
got
a
finding
that
the
strike
itself
is
in
breach
of
contract
and
at
that
stage
then
you
are
running
head
long
into
the
norris-laguardia
problem
of
curing
the
evil
that
was
there,
namely
you
may
be
enjoining
what
is
the
lawful
strike.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no.
mr.
justice
white,
my
understanding
is
the
courts
below
did
not
reach
that
question.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
think
that
is
correct
because
under
our
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
because
i
think
there
is
a
very
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case,
the
strike
itself
is
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
think
that
is
the
correct
legal
analysis
that
they
would
come
out
the
same
way.
all
i
am
suggesting
it
the
fact
that
they
did
not
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
breach
at
all
is
a
separate
independent
argument
we
have
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
no
injunction
should
issue
because
what
you
are
talking
about
here
is
the
situation
where
we
have
protected
a
protected
sympathy
strike
unless
and
until
there
is
a
clear
and
unequivocal
waiver.
now,
the
circuits
that
i
have
look
at
that
question
for
example
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
we
cited
the
gary
hobart
case
and
the
hyster
case
have
looked
for
very
clear
and
unmistakable
language
and
in
some
instances
have
said
that
the
general
language
of
a
no
strike
clause
does
not
suffice
to
bring
it
within
this
waiver
doctrine
and
they
have
looked
to
the
bargaining
history
of
the
parties
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
when
they
have
reached
an
agreement
that
there
would
be
no
strike,
that
the
union
had
in
effect
agreed
that
it
was
foregoing
protected
nlra
rights
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
actually
gary
hobart
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
posture
and
hyster
came
up
in
the
posture
of
the
injunction.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes,
we
would
because
then
we
have
a
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance
and
then
we
have
the
interference
that
boys
market
was
designed
to
avoid
in
that
kind
of
an
accommodation.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
excuse
me
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
once
again
at
that
stage,
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
enter
into
this
balancing
process
between
the
norris-laguardia
on
one
hand
and
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
we
do
not
have
any
strong
position
in
that
regard.
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
only
circuit
that
has
looked
at
that
problem
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
recently
concluded
that
they
would
find
that
an
injunction
would
be
appropriate
in
that
situation.
it
is
the
only
court
that
i
know
that
has
looked
at
that
question.
we
think
it
is
something
that
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
once
again
the
enforceable
arbitration
award
that
does
not
answer
the
question
of
enjoining
a
strike
which
has
a
norris-laguardia
overtone
to
it,
even
though
in
fact,
that
is
what
is
happening
and
that
would
be
the
argument
of
course
against
the
proposition
that
you
could.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
we
are
not
saying
that
at
all
mr.
justice
white
because
my
exchange
with
mr.
justice
stevens
was
that
as
long
as
you
have
a
strike
over
in
arbitrable
grievance
then
and
in
fact
that
strike
is
in
breach
and
then
boys
market
applies
an
injunction
can
issue.
a
fortiori
if
not
only
did
send
them
to
arbitration,
but
the
arbitrator
ruled
against
the
union
and
the
union
kept
striking,
boys
market
likewise
would
apply,
but
i
was
addressing
a
separate
question.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
i
did
not
say
that
was
the
case.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
what
i
said
was
that
if
you
have
a
situation
where
the
strike
itself
was
not
over
and
arbitrable
grievance,
but
that
eventually
you
get
an
arbitration
award
and
the
question
is
if
the
union
in
the
face
of
that
arbitration
award
continues
to
strike
then
i
am
saying
the
court
is
called
upon
to
make
an
independent
analysis
and
it
is
different
than
boys
market
to
the
extent
that
you
never
had
a
strike
over
an
underlying
grievance.
that
is
the
difference.
now,
whether
or
not
that
should
tip
the
balance
and
allow
the
strike
to
continue
all
i
am
saying
is
that
it
is
not
this
case
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
correct
and
we
said
our
basic
proposition
was
in
the
name
of
invoking
arbitration
to
its
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
we
have
not
contemplated
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
i
do
not
know
what
the
company’s
position
was
insofar
as
their
failing
to
file
a
grievance.
it
appeared
to
us
that
they
were
awaiting
for
the
union
to
file
a
grievance,
requesting
some
advisory
opinion
from
an
arbitrator
as
to
the
legality
of
our
going
out
on
strike,
that
appeared
to
me
what
counsel
was
saying
to
the
court
this
morning
in
the
face
of
the
whole
structure
and
system
of
arbitration
which
that
of
course
is
not
how
it
functions.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
you
will
notice,
however,
that
refers
back
to
our
problem
that
in
fact
never
got
before
the
court.
if
you
look
at
paragraph
13
of
the
complaint
at
page
6,
you
will
see
what
happened.
what
happened
mr.
justice
stewart
is
essentially
this.
the
petitioner
recognized
that
he
was
coming
in
for
an
injunction
in
circumstances
that
could
not
satisfy
boys
market.
they
could
not
satisfy
boys
market
because
the
union
strike
was
not
over
an
arbitrable
grievance.
so
the
employer
tried
to
create
an
arbitrable
grievance
by
saying
there
was
activity
going
on
at
the
plant
which
was
in
fact
arbitrable
under
the
contract
and
that
the
union
was
actually
striking
over
that
arbitrable
dispute.
it
involved
the
question
of
whether
truck
drivers
should
handle
certain
kind
of
work.
that
is
referred
to
particularly
in
paragraph,
i
think
i
told
you
the
right
paragraphs
of
the
complaint.
what
happen
in
district
court
though
was
that
the
court
found
that
the
sole
underlying
cause
of
this
strike
was
the
sympathy
action
of
the
union
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
company’s
assertion
that
the
underlying
cause
of
the
strike
was
in
fact
an
arbitrable
grievance
which
would
have
triggered
boys
market.
now,
that
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court
was
never
appealed
to
the
circuit
and
stands
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
still
do
not
think
that
is
what
was
being
referred
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
was
referring
to
the
core
question
of
do
you
have
a
strike
over
an
arbitrable
grievance
and
the
court
finds
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes
sir.
the
strike,
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
strike
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
absolutely.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
no,
i
am
sorry.
that
has
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
question
of
whether
the
underlying
cause
of
the
strike
was
an
arbitrable
grievance.
that
is
what
the
court
was
addressing
itself
to.
they
had
taken
as
a
given
the
proposition
that
there
was
an
arbitrable
grievance
down
the
line,
but
they
were
focusing
on
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
what
was
the
strike
over?
they
were
focusing
on
what
was
the
strike
over
and
the
strike
was
a
sympathy
strike
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
the
terms
or
condition
of
employment
of
the
production
and
maintenance
employees.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
well,
it
would
be
a
grievance,
but
it
would
not
be
an
arbitrable
grievance
under
the
language
of
the
agreement.
thank
you.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
your
honor,
there
is
some
nonsense
that
is
being
discussed
at
this
point
about
whether
the
employee
ever
precipitated
the
filing
of
a
grievance.
as
i
mentioned
in
the
opening
argument,
as
soon
as
the
employer
learned
of
some
kind
of
a
strike
plan,
it
immediately
fired
of
a
telegram
to
the
union
which
is
in
the
adjoined
appendix,
complaining
about
the
report
and
offering
to
go
to
arbitration
over
any
dispute
which
would
cause
this
and
that
is
in
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
on
page
23.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
we
thought
we
had
in
the
telegram
as
well
as
when
we
came
before
the
district
judge
and
immediately
announced
our
position
was
two-fold.
one
we
thought
the
strike
had
been
caused
because
of
this
dispute
involving
truck
driving
assignments
and
also
using
the
line
of
cases
that
identify
as
the
monongahela
type
of
case
felt
that
the
over
a
grievance
should
not
be
interpreted
literally
that
as
long
the
strike
involved
in
arbitrable
matter
that
an
injunction
should
lie.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
you
can
go
into
court
and
ask
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
that
is
true.
in
monongahela
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
yes
but
there
are
cases
where
the
employer
has
–-
well,
i
am
trying
to
answer
this
quickly
because
it
is
obviously
bothering
the
justices.
first,
if
the
employer
need
not
have
any
right
under
the
contract
to
require
the
union
to
arbitrate,
that
is
even
if
the
employer
has
no
right
to
compel
the
union
to
arbitrate
the
issue
of
the
no
strike
breach,
we
should
be
entitled,
the
employer
should
be
entitled
to
get
an
injunction
simply
because
the
union
has
a
right
to
have
the
matter
arbitrated,
i
am
referring
to
monongahela
line
of
cases
where
the
employer
had
no
right
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
has
no
right
to
initiate
it
and
the
question
of
who
has
the
right
to
initiate
is
irrelevant
we
contend.
it
is
a
question
whether
out
of
the
contract
there
is
an
arbitrable
dispute.
now,
if
i
could
make
one
comment
about
an
issue
that
is
obviously
troubling
several
of
the
justices
--
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
--
and
i
will.
if
in
boys
market
the
union
had
said
to
the
employer
and
to
the
court,
not
only
do
we
have
no
right
to
compel
the
employer
to
have
bargaining
employees
stock
the
shelves
versus
vendor’s
employees,
we
agree
that
if
we
struck
for
that
result,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract.
now,
if
that
issue
had
presented
to
the
court
in
boys
market
where
the
union
strike
was
simply
to
force
the
employee
to
exercise
discretion
on
behalf
of
the
bargaining
unit,
i
suggest
that
you
would
have
still
made
the
same
decision
in
boys
market
that
you
eventually
did.
mr.
jeremy
v.
cohen
thank
you.
