justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
the
arbitration
clause
did
not
reach
the
stand
of
the
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
kind
of
a
dispute
was
not
arbitrable?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
if
it
is
not
a
live
grievance
though,
it
is
un-arbitrable,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
does
the
clause,
the
arbitration
clause
appear
in
the
record
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
also
for
remedy,
it
is
not
just
to
settle
factual
disputes?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
cannot
concede
yourself
out
of
arbitration,
can
you
if
you
have
other
party
to
the
promise
insists
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
in
this
case,
however,
that
you
got
here
that
the
union
says
that
their
conduct
did
not
violate
the
no
strike
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
still
dispute
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
under
a
contract,
the
employer
has
some
objections
to
what
the
union
is
doing,
like
it
is
striking
when
it
should
not
be
striking
in
violation
of
the
no
strike
clause
and
suppose
on
the
face
of
the
arbitration
clause,
it
says,
it
covers
all
disputes
or
at
least
it
all
covers
all
disputes
about
interpretation
of
contract,
the
union
says
we
are
striking,
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
strike
that
is
covered
by
the
clause.
the
employer
said
yes
it
is
and
so
they
have
a
dispute
over
the
meaning
of
the
no
strike
clause.
how
does
that
ever
get
to
arbitration?
can
the
employer
request
a
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
whom
will
he
file
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
call
out
a
grievance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
agree
that
whether
or
not
the
union’s
conduct
violated
the
no
strike
clause
was
arbitrable
under
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
grievance
had
been
filed
and
the
employer
had
said
by
the
way,
while
this
grievance
is
pending
for
decision,
you
must
not
strike,
you
would
say
we
are
going
to
strike
until
and
unless
the
arbitrator
tells
us
not
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
an
arbitrator
normally
have
any
power
to
control
the
conduct
to
pending
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
an
employer
discharge
just
someone
and
there
is
a
grievance
filed
over
it
and
it
goes
to
arbitration,
pending
arbitration,
the
fellow
stays
fired
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
unless
the
employer
voluntarily
takes
him
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes
but
we
do
not
have
--
the
courts
below
said
even
if
it
is
in
--
did
they
not
say
even
if
this
is
in
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
that
we
must
assume
that
they
would
come
out
the
same
way
even
if
it
had
been
a
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
we
should
judge
this
case
on
the
assumption
this
was
not
a
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
courts
below
said
they
would
come
out,
i
think
they
said
that
they
would
have
come
up
the
same
way
even
if
the
strike
was
not
a
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
other
enforceable
arbitration
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
in
the
boys
market
case,
you
could
enjoin
the
strike
until
the
arbitration
was
over,
but
you
could
not
afterwards?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
concentrate
on
the
legality
of
the
strike
then
and
then
say
that
whatever
the
arbitrator
says
the
union
can
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
like
to
go
and
take
a
position
on
it
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
have
--
to
the
extent
you
have
an
easy
case,
you
even
got
an
easier
one
or
a
less
hard
one,
however
you
want
to
put
it
because
the
employer
here,
he
had
the
right
to
arbitrate
and
could
arbitrate.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wanted
to
get
the
legality
of
the
strike
adjudicated
or
get
the
strike
stopped
in
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
ever
filing,
even
if
he
could
have
gotten
an
injunction
if
he
had
filed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
move
to
dismiss
for
kind
of
exhausting
the
arbitration
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
exactly
dispositive,
i
do
not
think.
you
use
that
in
the
union
and
if
you
have
any
grievance
with
me,
let
us
arbitrate.
that
is
what
you
said.
that
is
what
your
complaint
says,
that
you
were
completely
willing
at
any
time
to
arbitrate
any
grievance
the
union
had
with
it.
the
question
is
if
they
were
striking,
they
were
not
crossing
the
picket
line,
you
had
a
grievance
with
them,
did
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ever
ask
them
to
arbitrate
that
grievance,
that
particular
grievance
not
some
other
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
usually
do.
when
you
ask
the
moment,
you
send
somebody
a
letter
or
communicate
with
them
and
say,
i
have
a
grievance
with
you
and
you
get
no
response
whatsoever
to
exhaust
the
contractual
remedies
then
you
ask
them
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
both
the
arbitration,
if
there
is
an
established
board
you
file
it
with
the
board.
if
there
is
not
you
ask
the
other
party
to
name
whatever
you
have
to
do
to
set
up
your
arbitration
panel?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
that
is
where
it
would
follow?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
it
arose
when
the
respondent
union
called
a
strike
in
support
of
certain
sister
unions
involved
in
negotiations
with
the
same
employer.
the
employer
claims
that
the
strike
was
in
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause
contained
in
the
contract
between
the
company
and
the
union.
on
the
other
hand,
the
union
said
that
sympathy
strikes
weren’t
reached
by
the
no-strike
clause.
the
contract
also
contained
arbitration
provision,
admittedly
reaching
the
issue
whether
a
sympathy
strike
did
violate
the
promise
of
the
union,
not
to
strike.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
a
federal
court
may
issue
an
injunction
against
a
strike,
pending
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
as
to
whether
the
union
has
breached
it's
promise
not
to
strike
by
calling
a
sympathy
strike.
court
of
appeals
said
that
federal
court
had
no
such
power
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
stated
in
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
debars
the
issue
of
some
injunction,
pending
arbitration
of
the
issue
that
i
have
described.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
he
is
joined
by
justices
brennan,
marshall
and
powell.
