mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
counsel
as
to
the
single
question
that
we
are
faced
with
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
subject
wild
horse
act
exceeds
the
powers
of
congress
under
the
property
on
the
commerce
clauses
and
we
are
in
basic
agreement
i
think
with
him
on
the
factual
recitation
that
he
gave
with
one
or
two
minor
exceptions
which
i
think
i
must
first
address.
the
common
misconception
among
people
who
have
not
lived
in
the
west
or
the
southwest
and
had
to
do
with
the
ranching
industry
was
expressed
by
counsel
here
this
afternoon
in
the
argument,
drawing
the
distinction
as
he
did
between
the
blm
land,
public
domain
and
the
fee
land.
these
burros,
if
your
honors
may
please,
were
found
on
kelley
stephenson’s
ranch.
he,
for
19
years
have
been
a
rancher
in
new
mexico
in
this
particular
area,
where
he
had,
as
you
will
see
from
page
81
of
the
appendix
on
the
plot,
where
he
had
a
relatively
small
ranch
for
that
area
which
consisted
of
these
8000
acres
of
blm
land,
but
combined
with
that
was
about
3000
acres
of
his
own
private
deeded
fee
land
and
another
1000
acres
of
state
leased
land,
that
comprises
his
ranch.
as
you
will
see,
it
bounded
on
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct.
yes.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
his
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct,
except
that,
this
record
also
contains
the
testimony
of
kelley
stephenson
about
these
burros
in
general
from
which
i
think
you
might
well
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
think
he
did
not
testify
and
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
these
particular
burros
that,
that
was
true.
what
he
did
say
was
that
during
the
19
years
he
had
been
there,
he
had
known
some
eight
or
10
of
these
wild
animals.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
no
sir,
he
did
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
we
will
admit
that
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
admit
that
they
were
wrong
because
of
the
statement
i
was
about
to
make
about
the
testimony
in
the
record
from
which
i
think
the
three-judge
court
might
well
have
drawn
a
reasonable
inference
that
these
were
the
donkeys
that
have
been
seen
in
the
past
back
up
on
the
foot
hills
on
his
fee
land.
if
you
will
start
--
i
think
it
is
at
about
47
on
the
record
where
he
talks
about
having
seen
wild
donkeys
over
to
the
east
in
the
foot
hills
on
his
fee
land.
he
said
that
is
mostly
where
they
run
because
that
is
the
better
land
and
that
is
where
they
stay.
on
these
particular
ones,
the
first
time
they
were
seen
was
at
the
taylor
well
that
was
spoken
off
and
that
was
in
fact
on
blm
land
and
they
were
seized
by
the
livestock
board
there.
i
think
counsel
has
adequately
set
forth
the
facts
in
response
to
some
questions
propounded
to
him
about
his
having
first
made
a
complaint
to
the
blm
people
about
the
molestation
of
his
cattle
by
these
donkeys
and
his
unsuccessful
attempt
to
do
something
about
it
through
blm,
which
necessitated
his
then
going
of
course
to
the
state
authorities
under
our
state
estray
laws
for
relief
which
he
got.
because
in
accordance
with
our
state
laws,
they
picked
them
up
and
sold
them
at
the
public
auction
as
they
have
done
i
suppose
since
the
statehood
in
new
mexico,
a
practice
that
is
common
throughout
the
western
states.
the
point
has
already
been
made
about
the
extension
of
this
act
onto
private
land.
it
covers
not
only
public
land.
it
specifically
covers
private
land
in
several
particulars.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
do
it
because
this
whole
controversy
arose
out
of
more
than
just
these
19
donkeys.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
but
at
page
66
of
the
appendix,
you
will
find
a
part
of
a
series
of
correspondence
between
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
mr.
lee
garner,
who
is
the
director
of
livestock
board
pointing
up
the
real
controversy,
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
is
having
with
the
federal
government,
particularly
to
blm
with
respect
to
the
wild-horse
act.
in
the
very
first
paragraph
he
points
out
what
the
state's
position
is
with
respect
to
these
animals
that
are
found
running
either
on
private
land
or
on
public
domain.
he
claims
ownership
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
of
all
of
them.
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case
notwithstanding
what
government
counsel
has
to
say
about
the
narrow
limited
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
no
sir.
i
am
not
concerned
particularly
with
respect
to
these
limited
numbers
of
animals.
i
am
concerned
with
the
act
itself
and
so
was
my
declaratory
judgment
complaint
and
that
was
the
basis
i
think
of
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
federal
court
who
struck
it
down.
it
was
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
power
given
by
the
constitution
to
congress
under
either
the
property
or
the
commerce
clauses
to
regulate
as
they
did
here
completely
and
absolutely
the
control
and
in
effect
for
all
practical
purposes,
indeed
the
ownership
of
animals.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
indeed
our
contention
and
has
been
throughout
and
was
the
in
effect
the
holding
of
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
new
mexico.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
well,
of
course,
i
think
the
record
does
disclose
an
actual
conflict
between
the
state
government
and
the
federal
government
in
this
area,
including
the
letter
i
just
made
reference
to
mr.
garners,
as
to
who
has
the
jurisdiction
and
the
right
to
regulate
and
control
these
wild
animals.
the
state
contends
that
it
does.
now,
it
is
true
that
these
allegations
in
those
particular
paragraphs
are
limited
to
that
factual
setting,
but
that
was
simply
background
material
to
point
up
what
the
controversy
was
which
we
think
is
justiciable
concerning
which
we
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
entire
act.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
the
united
states
contends
that
and
we
deny
that
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
do
contend
that.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
no
sir.
i
think
not.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
well,
because
i
think
you
must,
well
of
course,
perhaps
it
would
be
what
you
must
look
at
to
determine
that
question
is
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
constitutional
authority.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
extends
to
private
land.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
we
do,
your
honor.
that
is
a
part
of
the
case.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
let
me
point
up
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
we
think,
we
have
had
shown
that
here,
if
your
honor
please,
in
that
under
state
law,
we
went
in
under
our
estray
laws
and
we
took
possession
of
these
animals
while
they
were
on
the
public
domain,
animals
that
we
admitted
were
unbranded
and
unclaimed,
and
therefore,
fit
the
definition
under
section
2
of
this
act
as
wild
burros
and
we
sold
them
in
violation
of
the
specific
penalty
provision,
mr.
lee
garner
did
as
the
director
of
the
livestock
board,
thereby
subjecting
himself
to
the
$2000.00
fine
and
imprisonment
for
violation
of
section
8
of
the
act.
we
think
that
does
make
a
justiciable
controversy
with
respect
to
the
act's
validity.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
i
am
not
sure
i
am
following
here.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
well,
we
think
that
it
is
in
the
sense
that
the
three-judge
federal
court
had
before
it
evidence
from
which
and
i
mentioned
this
a
moment
ago,
i
think
they
could
reasonably
have
inferred
that
these
animals
were
at
one
time
on
his
fee
land
and
may
have
gotten
over
on
the
public
domain
at
the
time
they
were
noticed,
at
the
time
they
were
picked
up,
that
is
where
they
were.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
point
i
was
going
make
about
how
this
act
has
been
extended
to
cover
private
land
by
looking
at
the
difference
between
the
definition
in
the
act
itself
as
to
what
is
a
wild
horse
or
a
wild
burro
and
the
regulations
which
have
been
promulgated
by
the
secretaries
under
it.
the
definition
of
the
act
is
in
section
2
(b)
“all
unbranded
and
unclaimed
horses
and
burros
on
public
lands
of
the
united
states,”
but
the
definition
contained
in
4710.05
of
the
secretaries
regulations
promulgated
under
that
go
a
great
deal
further.
they
say
that
it
means
“all
unbranded
non-claimed
horses
and
burros
and
their
offspring
that
have
used
public
lands
on
or
after
december
15,
1971
or,”
and
this
is
an
important
phrase,
“or
that
do
use
these
lands
as
all
or
part
of
their
habitat”
and
i
am
saying
to
you
that
these
animals
on
this
record
fit
within
that
last
category.
that
they
are
animals
that
were
on
his
ranch
presumably
on
his
fee
land
that
came
on
to
the
federal
land
that
could
well
have
gone
back
to
his
fee
land.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct.
yes,
it
is
true.
now,
the
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
true.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
true.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
that
is
true
where
you
are
talking
about
horses
or
burros
or
elk
or
deer,
or
whatever,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
indeed,
that
is
our
position.
we
think
that
the
state
would
certainly
have
that
authority
under
the
decided
cases
of
this
court
respecting
ownership
of
game
animals.
we
think
that
is
true.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
anyone
can
own
game,
the
state
does.
that
is
what
this
court
held
in
geer.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
i
mean
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
they
exercise
all
of
the
rights
of
ownership
that
we
know
of.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
geer
was
not
the
first
case.
geer
came
down
80
years
ago.
twenty
years
before
that
there
was
the
virginia
case
that
is
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
the
deer
--
that
is
here.
deer
and
elk
--
yes
sir.
well,
i
think
neither
of
them
involved
wild
animals.
geer
involved
the
grass,
ruffled
grass,
and
quail
and
so
forth,
but
that
was
indeed
the
holding
of
the
geer
case.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes,
but
they
said
this
about
it
and
i
am
glad
you
brought
it
up
because
they
say
it
is
a
legal
fiction
expressive
in
a
legal
shorthand
of
the
importance
to
its
people
that
a
state
have
the
power
to
preserve
and
regulate
the
exportation
of
an
important
resource.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
it
is
the
people
of
the
state
in
accordance
with
the
decision
in
geer
--
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
and
lacoste
which
came
along
later
and
in
toomer?
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
because
i
think
the
act
is
unconstitutional
and
void
as
violative
of
the
tenth
amendment
in
that,
there
is
no
power
given
to
the
congress
by
our
constitution
either
under
the
property
clause
or
the
commerce
clause
to
regulate
animals
which
we
own.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
the
state?
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
indeed
think
that
the
state
has
that
right.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir,
on
wild
animals.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
that
is
an
incompletely
different
category
because
there
you
dealing
with
the
different
categorization
of
federal
land.
you
are
dealing
with
lands
that
have
an
effect
been
withdrawn
either
by
act
of
congress
or
by
session
from
the
state
of
federal
land.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
definitely
the
situation
is
different.
there
in
most
instances
you
have
the
consent
of
the
state
to
the
regulation
by
the
federal
government
of
the
animals
on
the
national
parks.
it
is
a
completely
different
situation.
mr.
george
t.
harris,
jr.
the
migratory
game
act,
if
i
can
address
that
for
just
a
moment,
involves
or
did
involve
basically
the
same
argument
that
we
got
here
with
our
donkey
case.
way
back
in
1914,
i
think
was
the
first
federal
court
decision
that
came
out
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
u.s.
against
shauver
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
that
involved
a
1913
federal
act
called
the
migratory
bird
act
and
the
federal
court
there
in
shauver
struck
it
down
as
violative
of
the
constitution
and
incidentally
both
the
property
clauses
and
the
commerce
clauses
were
relied
upon
by
the
government
for
their
authority
to
pass
that
migratory
bird
act.
that
case
was
not
appealed
and
that
decision
was
not
looked
up
by
this
court.
a
year
later
in
the
state
of
kansas,
another
federal
district
court
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
they
said
that
the
property
clause
and
the
commerce
clause
is
no
authority
to
congress
to
pass
a
migratory
bird
act
and
they
did
it
on
the
basis
of
ownership
of
game.
then
in
1916,
just
a
year
after
that,
there
was
a
treaty
entered
into
between
great
britain
and
united
states,
involving
the
protection
of
migratory
waterfowl
between
canada
and
united
states
and
mexico.
that
was
a
treaty
and
following
that,
congress
passed
another
act
called
the
migratory
bird
treaty
act
which
was
the
subject
of
the
litigation
in
missouri
against
holland
in
1920
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
congress
did
have
authority
to
pass
that,
but
it
was
the
treaty
making
authority
which
gave
it
to
them.
it
was
not
the
property
clause
which
has
been
rejected
in
these
two
earlier
federal
court
cases
nor
it
was
the
commerce
clause,
it
was
the
treaty
power.
that
is
not
involved
in
our
case.
we
do
not
have
migratory
fowls.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
three-judge
federal
court
so
held
and
that
we
are
not
talking
about
a
migratory
situation
with
these
animals.
they
tend
to
stay
in
one
area.
they
do
not
migrate
from
state
to
state
and
certainly
not
from
country
to
country
as
do
the
waterfowl.
i
think
those
cases
support
our
view
in
this
case.
i
think
the
two
earlier
federal
district
court
cases
are
exactly,
the
theory
that
we
are
asserting
to
this
court
in
this
case.
that
the
property
clause
and
the
commerce
clause
do
not
give
congress
authority
to
regulate
in
area
that
has
since
statehood,
since
the
nationhood,
has
belonged
exclusively
to
the
states,
that
is
a
right
to
manage
their
game
animals.
now,
i
have
not
touched
the
commerce
clause
nor
was
that
discussed
i
think
at
length
at
all
for
that
matter
by
a
counsel
for
the
government.
the
commerce
clause
as
the
lower
court
also
found
that
is
embodied
in
its
opinion
here,
was
not
relied
upon
by
a
congress
in
this
case.
there
are
no
congressional
findings
at
all
with
reference
to
it.
it
is
not
mentioned
anywhere
in
the
act.
there
is
not
anything
in
this
record
and
incidentally
the
federal
governments
had
the
right
to
make
a
record
and
to
put
on
evidence
in
this
case
and
they
declined
to
do
so.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
or
anywhere
in
this
record
as
to
any
burdens
of
any
kind
that
would
be
imposed
upon
interstate
commerce
in
this
case
with
respect
to
these
animals.
that
simply
is
not
in
the
case
and
the
lower
court
so
held
that
the
commerce
clause
was
not
involved.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
act
itself
expressly
bases
its
provisions
upon
the
property
clause
by
simply
saying
and
this
i
think
is
a
novel
theory
that
these
animals
are
a
part
of
the
land
that
is
the
fallacy,
the
false
premise
upon
which
the
whole
argument
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
based
and
it
is
asserted
in
a
very
short
sentence
on
page
9
of
the
government's
reply
brief
where
they
say
“these
animals
are
part
of
the
public
domain.”
they
base
their
whole
property
clause
argument
upon
the
fact
that
these
animals
are
part
of
the
land.
every
case
that
they
cite
in
their
brief
pertains
to
situations
where
either
number
one,
the
case
is
concerned
with
a
disposition
or
some
control
of
the
lands
itself
or
something
that
is
related
directly
to
it
and
a
part
of
it,
the
ashwander
case,
tv
authority
case,
concerned
government
bans
on
electrical
energy.
they
fell
in
that
category
of
cases
in
their
briefs
are
they
fell
in
the
category
of
protecting
the
government's
land
against
damage
and
no
one
has
any
quarrel
with
it.
certainly
the
government
has
the
right
to
do
so,
but
all
their
cases
are
directed
to
that
proposition.
they
do
not
cite
a
case
nor
have
we
found
one
which
stands
for
this
new
and
novel
proposition
that
wild
animals
are
a
part
of
the
federal
soil,
and
therefore,
under
our
property
clause,
we
have
the
right
to
the
exclusive
regulation
and
the
management
and
the
ownership
of
them.
we
think
that
the
federal
court
was
right
and
it
is
willing
any
reversal
of
that
is
going
to
have,
i
think
a
catastrophic
effect
with
respect
to
all
50
of
the
states
as
to
their
game
regulation
provisions
and
certainly
to
the
western
states
where
as
here,
nevada
who
is
represented
here
at
the
counsel
table
today.
there
are
some
86%
of
the
lands
within
its
state
boundaries
that
belongs
to
the
federal
government
and
in
my
state
where
more
than
a
third
of
it
does
are
or
alaska
where
90
plus
%
of
it
does.
it
is
going
to
have
a
staggered
effect
upon
not
only
the
game
management
in
all
those
states,
but
a
tremendous
economic
impact
upon
the
cattle
in
the
ranching
industries
in
all
those
states
and
particularly
the
western
states
whereas
here
as
suggestion
was
made
by
counsel,
all
they
got
to
do
is
put
a
little
drift
fence
across
the
middle
of
their
ranch
and
protect
their
fee
lands
from
these
donkeys
and
that
just
is
not
a
practical
solution
to
the
problem.
there
being
no
constitutional
authority
to
congress
under
either
these
clauses,
we
think
that
the
lower
court's
judgment
must
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
