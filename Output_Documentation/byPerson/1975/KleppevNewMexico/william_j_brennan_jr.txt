purchase
to
what
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
was
trying
to
find
and
get
at
is,
do
they
dispose
them
and
kill
them
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
federal
act
is
to
preserve
those
species?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
on
that
first
paragraph
you
referred
us
to
page
66
that
the
state
has
ownership
of
these
animals
and
whether
they
are
on
federal
land
or
on
private
land
or
on
state
land
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
federal
government
has
no
power
regulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
your
premise
as
i
understood
it
that
the
state
owned
fee
land,
the
state
is
the
owner
of
these
animals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
premise
is
that,
that
being
true,
the
federal
government
has
absolutely
no
power
whatsoever
under
the
commerce
clause
or
the
property
clause
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
enact
this
statute
as
applied
to
animals
owned
by
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
would
not
matter
whether
the
issue
that
was
there
and
factually
it
is
true
here
that
they
were
on
private
land,
the
public
land
or
only
on
one
or
the
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
that
is
true
then
you
win
the
case?
