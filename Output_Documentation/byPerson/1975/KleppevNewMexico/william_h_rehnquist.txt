justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
evidence
of
eating
the
protein
blocks
came
in
without
objection,
presumably
the
complaint
is
deemed
amended,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
are
not
here
urging
that
the
senate
committee's
view
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
law,
are
you,
that
the
burros
anywhere
in
new
mexico
are
owned
“by
the
people
at
large?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
estimated
life
of
a
burro?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
a
burro
that
had
been
turned
in
the
depression
as
a
mere
infant
would
now
be
about
40
or
45?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
still
--
is
it
not
still
consistent
with
your
idea
that
by
time
he
complained
and
the
new
mexico
people
actually
came
to
get
them,
they
were
then
on
public
land?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
the
district
court
is
wrong
in
that
sense
that
justice
stevens
quoted
to
mr.
randolph?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harris,
if
you
will
turn
to
your
complaint,
the
appendix
at
page
7
where
you
have
paragraphs
six,
seven,
eight
all
refer
to
what
happened
to
kelley
stephenson
on
or
about
the
20th
day
of
january
1974,
on
these
particular
burros.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
that
you
really
do
not
have
the
standing
to
challenge
the
whole
sweep
of
the
act
unless
you
can
point
a
factual
situation
such
as
this
where
there
has
been
an
actual
conflict,
and
where
someone
has
actually
been
harmed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
leave
that
mr.
harris,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
i
suppose
it
is
not
enough
for
the
state
of
new
mexico
or
for
its
livestock
board
simply
do
not
want
to
have
something
adjudicated.
in
order
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
full
sweep
of
a
federal
statute,
you
got
to
show
that
it
has
a
direct
and
immediate
impact
on
you
and
somewhere
at
least
on
some
of
your
clients.
you
cannot
just
say
that
we
disagree
with
the
theory
on
which
the
statute
is
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
certainly
get
an
adjudication
on
what
law
governs
that
factual
situation.
my
question
is
whether
you
can
go
beyond
that
and
say
“and
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
provisions
of
the
law
that
are
not
relevant
to
what
lee
garner
did
or
these
nineteen
burros
but
we
want
them
decide
it
to?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
instance,
the
taking
of
burros
on
private
land
or
either
claimed
by
the
united
states
government
that
it
may
regulate
who
may
take
and
who
may
not
take
burros
from
concededly
fee
land,
not
lease
land,
not
public
land,
but
fee
land.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
really
is
not
raised
by
what
happened
to
kelley
stephenson?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
did
not
have
to
rely
on
that
regulation?
