justice

there
were
more
than
19
burros
in
that
part
of
new
mexico,
i
would
assume?
justice

like
in
to
the
effect
that
the
two
million
in
the
country
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

is
there
anything
in
the
lease
mr.
stephenson
had
that
touches
on
the
subject,
mentioned

in
that
connection,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
government
fenced
in
say
10,000
acres
of
its
own
land
with
fences
so
high
that
the
burros
could
not
leap
it
or
get
out
of
it,
would
the
state
have
authority
in
your
view
that
the
state
owns
these
burros
to
compel
the
government
to
take
the
fence
down
out
or
at
least
allow
the
burros
to
leave?
