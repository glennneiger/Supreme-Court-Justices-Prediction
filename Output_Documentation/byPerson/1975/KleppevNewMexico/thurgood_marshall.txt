justice

the
kleppe
case
involves
the
constitutionality
under
the
property
clause
of
the
wild
roaming
horses
and
burros
act.
the
act
designed
to
protect
“all
unbranded
and
unclaimed
horses
and
burros
on
public
lands
of
the
united
states"
from
"capture,
branding,
harassment,
or
death,".
appellees,
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
its
livestock
board
entered
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states
and
removed
19
unbranded
and
unclaimed
burros.
when
the
secretary
of
the
interior
demanded
their
return,
appellees
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
court
for
the
district
of
new
mexico
for
injunctive
relief
and
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional.
a
three-judge
district
court
held
the
act
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
its
enforcement.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
in
our
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
find
that
the
property
clause
gave
congress
power
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states.
this
clause
is
given
an
expansive
reading
for
the
power
of
the
public
lands
does
entrusted
to
congress
is
without
limitation.
we
find
that
congress
can
plead
power
over
these
lands
including
the
power
to
regulate
and
protect
the
wildlife.
contrary
to
appellees
contentions
the
act
does
not
impermissibly
intrude
upon
the
state's
sovereignty.
rather
federal
legislation
and
property
clause
necessarily
under
the
supremacy
clause,
overrides
any
conflicting
state
laws.
we
need
not
and
do
not
address
here
the
question
of
act's
permissible
reach
under
the
property
clause
over
federally
protected
burros
that
stray
on
to
private
lands.
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
district
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceeding
to
be
consistent
with
this
opinion.
