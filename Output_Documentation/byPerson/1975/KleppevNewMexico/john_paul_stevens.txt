mr.
randolph,
i
may
have
missed
it,
but
have
you
discussed
your
theory
of
how
the
government
has
the
power
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
burros
while
they
are
on
private
land?
i
thought
you
said
earlier
in
your
argument
that
they
were
not
burros
on
private
land,
but
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
it
completely
irrelevant,
the
question
that
they
are
getting
on
private
lands?
do
you
contend
the
united
states
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
you
do
not
argue
that
the
united
states
has
the
power
to
regulate
the
burros
when
they
are
on
private
land?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
first
or
second
sentence
of
the
three-judge
court
opinion,
they
say
these
burros
were
wondering
on
private
land.
do
you
say
that
finding
is
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
that
i
understand.
are
you
saying
that
finding
is
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then
we
must
assume
that
these
19
burros
were
on
private
lands
and
that
is
what
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
private
lands
when
the
man
made
his
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
so
found
that
you
contest
that
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
we
must
assume
for
purposes
of
decision
that
they
had
been
on
private
land?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
while
they
were
on
his
private
land,
do
you
contend
that
the
united
states
had
jurisdiction
over
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
controversy
involved
here
began
when
a
new
mexico
rancher,
kelley
stephenson
discovered
several
unbranded
and
unclaimed
burros
wondering
on
his
private
land
and
you
concede
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
were
suggesting
that
when
we
decide
this
case,
we
need
not
to
tell
a
rancher
who
finds
burros
on
his
own
private
lands
whether
he
should
follow
the
federal
procedure,
calling
the
federal
people
or
call
for
the
state
procedure
following
a
state
procedure,
that
is
a
question
we
will
save
for
some
other
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
makes
a
difference.
he
violates
federal
law,
if
he
does
that
and
then
we
do
not
tell
him
whether
that
is
constitutional
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
so
i
have
it
in
mind,
you
brought
a
three-judge
court
complaint
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
whole
statute
is
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
about
the
16
animals
and
all
the
rest,
really
goes
to
your
standing
to
attack
the
entire
statute
just
rather
than,
you
are
not
appealing
a
condemnation
or
anything
like
that?
