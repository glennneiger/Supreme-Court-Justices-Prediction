mr.
randolph
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
mexico,
declaring
the
wild
free-roaming
horses
&
burros
act
of
1971
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
the
secretary
of
interior
from
enforcing
that
act.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
congress
had
authority
under
the
constitution
to
pass
that
federal
legislation.
the
suit
was
begun
in
this
case
by
the
state
of
new
mexico,
its
livestock
board
and
director
and
one
private
individual
on
march
of
1974.
the
complaint
alleged
facts
relating
to
a
particular
incident
involving
19
burros
which
i
deal
with
shortly.
more
generally,
the
complaint
charged
that
the
federal
act
was
interfering
with
the
new
mexico
livestock
board’s
administration
of
their
estray
law,
estray
meaning
a
stray
domestic
animal.
that
as
a
result
of
that
interference,
the
state
of
new
mexico
was
being
deprived
of
constitutional
rights
and
then
numbers
were
enumerated,
including
the
tenth
amendment.
that
congress
had
no
authority
to
pass
this
piece
of
federal
legislation,
because
the
complainant
alleged,
the
animals
in
question,
the
wild
horses
and
burros
were
not
damaging
or
molesting,
i
think
the
term
is
used
in
this
complaint,
the
federal
land,
and
also
because
of
the
particular
burros
in
question
were
nonmigratory.
the
act,
i
should
give
a
short
description
of,
deals
with
as
the
title
indicates
wild
free-roaming
horses
and
burros
found
on
federal
land.
the
statute
defines
these
animals
as
all
unclaimed
and
unbranded
horses
and
burros
on
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states.
the
statute
further
defines
public
lands
to
mean
only
those
federal
lands
administered
by
the
bureau
of
land
management
of
the
department
of
interior
and
the
forest
service
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
that
is
not
an
insubstantial
quantitative
acreage.
about
300
million
acres
is
encompassed
within
the
administration
of
those
two
federal
agencies.
however
--
mr.
randolph
however,
the
forest
service
only
has
about
5%
of
all
the
wild
burros
comprised
on
these
two
areas
of
land,
95%
is
controlled
of
the
burros
and
wild
horses
are
on
blm
land.
mr.
randolph
blm,
yes.
the
act
directs
the
secretaries
to
manage
and
protect
--
mr.
randolph
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
of
how
many
burros
are
on
private
land
or
how
many
horses.
i
suppose
one
would
have
to,
first
of
all,
take
a
population
count,
but
this
only
deals
with
wild
--
mr.
randolph
sorry.
mr.
randolph
i
suppose
if
they
are
your
burro
and
they
are
your
horse.
mr.
randolph
it
does
for
a
wild
horse
or
wild
burro,
which
is
defined
as
an
unclaimed
or
unbranded
wild
horse
or
burro
on
public
land.
if
that
animal
strays
on
to
private
land,
the
act
provides
that
the
owner
of
the
private
land
may
call
either
the
blm
or
an
agent
of
the
secretary
of
the
agriculture,
and
ask
that
the
animal
be
removed,
in
which
case
the
particular
federal
officer
must
remove
the
animal.
section
4
of
the
act
provides
though,
however,
in
no
case
shall
the
individual
kill
the
animal
that
strays
onto
the
land.
mr.
randolph
(inaudible)
federal
criminal.
mr.
randolph
well,
the
act
provides
that
it
deals
with
the
wild
horses
and
burros
that
are
an
integral
part
of
the
federal
public
land.
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
randolph
i
do
not
--
i
realize
that.
i
do
not
think
that
that
means
that
simply
because
an
animal
sets
foot
on
federal
public
land
that
he
becomes
an
integral
part
of
it,
but
before
i
get
too
deeply
into
this
let
me
just
make
one
point.
that
issue
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
these
burros
that
were
taken
in
this
litigation
or
involved
in
this
litigation
were
first
of
all
found
on
federal
land
when
they
were
seized.
the
complaint
filed
by
the
state
of
new
mexico,
by
the
state
livestock
board
and
by
the
private
individual,
does
not
make
any
allegations
relating
to
the
question
whether
these
burros
were
on
private
land
or
not
on
private
land.
it
does
not
make
a
point
of
that,
but
so
far
as
the
evidence
shows,
the
burros
were
totally
on
public
land.
there
is
a
statement
on
page
4
of
the
appellee’s
brief
that
says
the
record
indicates
that
these
burros
spend
a
majority
of
time
on
private
land.
the
reference
in
the
brief
is
to
i
believe
at
page
46
and
48,
support
for
that
statement
in
the
record.
mr.
randolph
well,
there
is
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
they
damage
--
they
do
not
damage
the
public
land,
therefore
--
mr.
randolph
the
lessee's
property,
the
lessee
of
public
land
i
would
suppose.
mr.
randolph
well,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
maybe
i
will
give
a
factual
statement.
mr.
randolph
there
is
evidence
that
these
burros
were
eating
protein
blocks,
but
let
me
say
that
that
is
not
mr.
justice
white
a
usual
practice
for
all
the
grazing
--
within
taylor
grazing
act.
i
think
the
bureau
of
land
management
at
least
has
informed
me
that
supplemental
feeding
is
something
that
is
frowned
upon
usually.
you
are
not
supposed
to
--
as
well
salt,
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
because
the
burros
and
horses
then
tend
to
browse
more
than
they
otherwise
would
which
is
damaging
to
public
land
in
a
way
that
it
would
otherwise
not.
well,
that
is
active
or
not,
i
do
not
know.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
burros
that
were
involved
here
were
seized
from
one
mr.
kelley
stephenson’s
ranch
in
new
mexico,
in
the
south
central
part
of
new
mexico,
and
the
case
arose
as
follows:
while
mr.
stephenson,
a
new
mexico
cattle
rancher,
was
visiting
blm
offices
and
dropped
by
to
talk
to
a
number
blm
officials,
he
was
told
by
them
that
they
had
seen
25
burros
around
an
area
called
taylor
well.
now,
taylor
well
is
on
federal
land
and
taylor
well
is
a
joint
watering
spot
for
this
particular
rancher
and
another
rancher.
mr.
stephenson,
the
rancher
in
question
here,
had
a
six-month
permit
to
graze
about
40
head
of
cattle
as
a
winter
pasture
in
this
particular
area.
that
was
the
first,
apparently
mr.
stephenson
knew
about
the
burros
around
taylor
well.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
he
was
surprised
because
although
he
had
been
in
the
area
for
29
years
and
had
seen
burros
in
the
foothills
to
the
east,
he
had
never
seen
them
around
this
particular
well.
at
that
point,
as
far
as
mr.
stephenson
knew,
the
burros
and
the
cows
were
getting
along,
there
was
no
harm,
whether
they
are
eating
his
protein
blocks
or
not.
the
bureau
of
land
management
certainly
did
not
know,
at
least
all
they
have
was
a
photograph
of
the
burros
standing
around
the
well.
now,
mr.
stephenson
returned
to
his
ranch
and
confirmed
the
presence
of
the
burros,
but
rather
than
calling
up
the
bureau
of
land
management,
after
he
allegedly,
as
the
complaint
says
found
that
the
burros
were
molesting
the
cows,
rather
than
doing
that,
he
called
the
new
mexico
livestock
board.
now,
mr.
justice
white,
you
mentioned
the
problem
of
the
burros
perhaps
interfering
with
the
cows.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
regulations
that
the
bureau
of
land
management
has
promulgated
under
the
wild
horses
and
burros
act.
mr.
randolph
they
were
interfering
with
property
and
the
cows
are
the
ranch’s
property.
mr.
randolph
they
were
eating
protein
blocks.
mr.
randolph
that
was
it;
they
were
eating
his
protein
blocks.
but
if
they
were
in
--
but
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
are
that
they
were
molesting
his
cattle,
i
do
not
know
whether
the
complaint
even
talks
about
protein
blocks
or
salt
blocks
or
whatever;
the
complaint
says
that
they
were
molesting
his
cattle.
the
regulations
of
--
mr.
randolph
i
would
not
characterize
that
as
molesting.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
direct
physical
contact
which
is
i
think
what
he
was
claiming
and
pushing
them
aside
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
--
mr.
randolph
i
do
not
question
the
relevance
of
that.
i
am
saying
that
the
argument
and
the
contention
was
not
based
on
that
particular
fact
and
i
do
not
think
the
case
rests
on
it
in
one
way
or
the
another.
i
do
not
think
the
constitutionality
of
this
act
rests
on
whether
these
burros
were
eating
protein
blocks
or
not.
mr.
randolph
in
this
case,
they
were
found
on
public
property.
mr.
randolph
constitutionality
of
one
provision
of
this
act
which
is
not
a
question.
you
may
turn
on
that
question
but
that
is
not
an
issue
that
the
district
court
dealt
with
in
any
way.
in
any
event,
there
is
a
regulation
as
i
was
going
to
say
from
the
bureau
of
land
management
that
provides
the
problem
animals
shall
be
removed
from
an
area
if
they
interfere
with
wildlife
or
if
they
interfere
with
livestock
or
they
interfere
with
individuals.
but
rather
than
asking
the
bureau
of
land
management
after
the
rancher
returned,
the
rancher
called
in
the
new
mexico
livestock
board
which
is
composed
of
seven
individuals
who
according
to
state
statute
must
adequately
represent
the
livestock
industry
in
the
state
and
also
must
be
engaged
in
the
livestock
business.
mr.
randolph
there
was
an
allegation;
the
testimony
is
as
follows
on
that
question.
i
asked
the
bureau
of
land
management
official,
what
they
do
if
the
cows
and
donkeys
do
not
get
along.
he
said
and
i
think
i
am
quoting
this
almost
exactly,
if
the
cows
interfere
with
the
burros,
the
cows
have
to
go.
that
is
in
the
appendix.
the
new
mexico
livestock
--
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
but
he
is
--
mr.
stephenson
is
not
a
private
landowner
as
far
as
this
land
is
concerned.
the
closest
piece
of
mr.
stephenson’s
private
land
--
mr.
randolph
yes,
he
is
permitee
under
the
taylor
act,
having
a
six-month
grazing
permit
using
this
area
for
40
head
of
cattle
for
winter
pasture.
on
the
map,
that
is
included
in
the
appendix,
the
closest
piece
of
property
to
the
area
where
the
burros
were
seized,
that
is
in
private
ownership.
mr.
stephenson’s
ownership
is
two-and-a-half
miles
away
from
the
taylor
well.
the
quadrants
on
that
map
are
each
one
a
square
mile.
that
is
in
the
appendix.
the
new
mexico
livestock
board
has
said
administers,
what
they
call
the
state
estray
law
and
this
law
provides
that
any
horse
or
burro
running
at
large
on
the
public
or
private
land
of
the
state,
in
the
state
is
considered
an
estray,
a
stray
domestic
animal.
apparently
obviously,
the
new
mexico
livestock
board
construes
public
land
as
including
not
only
state
land,
but
also
federal
land
and
the
act
provides,
the
new
mexico
act
provides
that
a
person
having
knowledge
of
that
estrays,
may
upon
getting
the
authorization
of
the
livestock
board,
simply
round
them
up
so
long
as
he
shifts
them
to
the
nearest
railroad
depot
for
turning
over
to
an
official
with
the
new
mexico
livestock
board.
another
way
that
estrays
can
be
impounded
is
by
the
livestock
board
itself
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
now,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
something
that
i
discovered
only
in
preparation
for
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
new
mexico
estray
law
was
amended
after
the
decision
in
this
case.
the
definition
of
what
is
an
estray
was
changed
from,
“instead
of
any
horse,
burro,
mule,
etcetera,
running
at
large
on
public
or
private
lands”
it
was
changed
to
“any
livestock
or
buffalo
found
running
at
large
on
public
or
private
lands.”
we
do
not
think
that
changes
the
outcome
of
the
case
at
all.
obviously
there
is
--
mr.
randolph
after
they
get
them
they
are
supposed
to
be
disposed
of
according
to
the
directions
of
the
livestock
board.
in
this
case,
the
19
burros
were
seized
and
impounded
and
then
taken
by
truck
to
roswell,
i
hope
i
pronounced
that
correctly,
new
mexico
and
sold
at
the
public
auction.
the
proceeds
of
the
sale,
the
amount
of
the
sale
was
not
shown
in
the
record,
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
are
paid
to
the
new
mexico
livestock
board.
one
of
the
appellees
in
this
case,
appellee
foster
purchased
three
of
the
burros.
the
records
does
not
show
who
purchased
the
other
16.
mr.
randolph
well,
the
record
does
not
show
what
the
other
sixteen
were
purchased
for
and
--
mr.
randolph
well,
they
could
be
used
for
dog
food,
they
could
be
use
fertilizer,
they
could
be
use
as
pets,
and
they
could
be
used
for
donkey
basketball
teams.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
and
as
a
result
of
that
because
of
their
protection,
the
united
states
through
the
united
states
attorney’s
office,
when
it
found
out
about
the
burros,
demanded
their
return
from
the
new
mexico
livestock
board.
they
did
not
discover
this
until
after
the
sale
had
taken
place
which
was
one
week
in
february
at
1974,
after
the
burros
were
rounded
up.
when
the
united
states
demanded
return
of
the
burros,
this
suit
followed.
now,
our
principal
argument
in
this
case
is
that
the
act
is
a
valid
exercise
of
congress’
power
under
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution.
that
provides
the
congress
shall
have
power
to
make
all
needful
rules
and
regulations
respecting
the
territory
or
other
property
belonging
to
the
united
states.
congress
did
not
legislate,
however,
on
the
basis
that
these
animals,
roaming
the
federal
lands,
were
owned
by
the
united
states.
the
senate
report
specifically
says
that
these
animals
are
owned
by
no
one
individual,
but
they
are
owned
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
at
large
and
we
do
not
make
that
claim
in
this
case.
rather
our
claim
is
and
our
argument
that
the
regulation,
the
regulatory
authority
over
these
animals
is
derived
from
congress'
power
to
make
needful
rules
as
the
constitution
says,
respecting
the
federal
public
land.
mr.
randolph
we
do
not
press
that
contention
one
way
or
the
other
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
say,
regardless,
the
congress
legislates
in
great
many
ways
and
legislates
with
respect
to
great
many
things,
they
do
not
own
and
we
say
that
federal
government
does
not
own.
we
say
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
these
burros
are
owned,
if
they
are
on
federal
public
land
or
a
part
of
it
and
congress
can
legislate.
that
is
hardly
a
new
startling
proposition
and
one
of
the
cases
that
--
mr.
randolph
well,
we
think
it
is
from
the
necessary
proper
clause
that
there
are
areas
and
i
suppose
the
stephenson
ranch
is
just
one
indication,
where
--
which
comprises
about
8000
acres
of
federal
land
that
he
has
the
rights
to
accept
the
permit
to
graze
there
and
interspersed,
there
are
few
thousand
acres
of
private
land
and
state
land.
we
think
congress
in
order
to
preserve
these
animals
on
the
public
domain
could
protect
them
the
moment
--
from
being
shot,
the
moment
they
stepped
off
into
a
parcel
that
was
not
part
of
the
public
domain.
of
course
the
animal,
a
farmer
or
the
rancher
can
protect
against
that
i
suppose
by
fencing
his
property,
if
he
wishes
them
not
to
cross
there.
mr.
randolph
the
–
well
with
respect
to
--
if
the
state
does
that
with
the
respect
to
state
land,
and
state
does
that
with
the
respect
of
federal
land
as
well,
we
think
it
is
a
different
question
because
we
are
deriving
not,
federal
government
is
deriving
its
power
from
the
fact
of
ownership
of
the
public
land,
whereas
the
state
in
the
cases
like
geer
and
others
is
dealing
with
a
kind
of
a
general
police
power
to
provide
the
health
and
welfare
of
its
citizens.
mr.
randolph
well,
i
was
going
to
speak
to
that
right
directly
mr.
justice
white
which
deals
with
the
power
of
an
individual
over
his
land
and
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
authority
that
is
being
suggested
here
by
congress,
that
is
being
put
forth
in
the
wild
horses
and
burros
act
is
hardly
a
new
startling
proposition.
one
of
the
cases
that
has
been
cited
by
the
appellee
is
geer
versus
connecticut
and
if
you
read
geer,
the
court
points
out
that
as
far
back
as
the
sixth
century
in
the
ancient
rome,
in
the
institutes
of
justinian,
it
was
recognized
that
a
landowner
has
the
right
to
prevent
others
from
killing
game
on
his
land
and
that
is
what
congress
has,
as
far
as
the
part
of
the
act
is
at
issue
here,
provided.
mr.
randolph
yes,
they
are
feral.
mr.
randolph
a
feral
animal
usually
refers
to
an
animal
that
--
mr.
randolph
usually
one
that
had
been
domesticated
is
a
feral
animal.
mr.
randolph
it
means
wild,
but
it
usually
is
used
to
refer
to
one
that
had
prior
--
previously
been
domesticated,
but
beside
from
that,
and
we
think
the
proposition;
that
congress
can
control
these
animals
on
the
federal
land
is
hardly
open
to
doubt.
congress
could
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
case
called
light
versus
the
united
states
that
prevent
anyone
from
coming
onto
the
public
land
at
all.
it
could
build
a
fence
around
all
300,000,000
acres
of
the
public
domain.
it
could
charge
anybody
coming
on
there
with
trespassing,
it
has
that
authority.
we
think
it
also
could
provide
a
gatekeeper
that
says
if
you
come
on
to
the
public
land,
you
shall
not
kill
the
animals
that
are
there.
if
congress
can
do
that
and
i
think
that
is
clear
from
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
we
think
it
has
the
lesser
power
to
say
that
if
you
come
on,
do
not
destroy
the
animals
that
are
using
the
public
domain
and
have
used
it
for
hundreds
of
years.
do
not
destroy
them,
do
not
molest
them,
do
not
harass
them,
do
not
capture
them,
and
take
them
away.
that
is
all
this
act
does.
the
district
court’s
opinion
states
that
congress
could
not
protect
the
wild
horses
and
the
wild
burros
because
they
were
damaging
the
federal
public
land,
it
is
the
way
the
district
court
put
it.
we
find
this
rather
strange
proposition.
it
would
mean
that
if
they
are
damaging
the
federal
public
land,
then
congress
could
protect
them
or
if
they
were
benefiting
the
federal
public
land
i
suppose
then
congress
could
destroy
them.
that
we
submit
really
does
not
make
very
much
sense
and
certainly
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
intend
we
think,
the
property
clause
to
be
read
that
way.
now,
i
notice
that
in
the
--
because
i
pointed
out
the
complaint
of
the
appellees
suggested
that
congress
could
not
legislate
because
these
animals
do
not
damage
the
federal
land.
now,
they
argue
in
their
brief
that
congress’
legislation
is
unconstitutional
because
these
animals
do
in
fact
damage
the
public
land.
the
statute
that
is
in
question
here
was
enacted
by
congress
we
think
in
a
great
tradition
of
the
property
clause.
congress
found
that
these
animals
were
components
of
the
federal
land
and
that
is
the
fact
that
could
not
be
disputed.
the
animals,
at
least
these
equine
animals,
were
found
on
the
north
america
continent
as
long
as
millions
of
years
ago.
they
disappeared
ten
thousand
years
ago
and
were
reintroduced,
congress
and
studies
that
were
before
congress,
show
by
spanish
conquistadors
in
the
early
16th
century.
they
have
been
roaming
the
western
plains
ever
since,
but
one
thing
that
we
do
not
argue
and
the
congress
did
not
labor
under
the
illusion
that
they
were
protecting
an
endangered
species.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
evidence
shows
that
these
wild
horses
and
burros
are
not
really
separate
species
from
domestic
animals
at
all.
there
is
some
contrary
evidence
before
congress,
i
do
not
think
that
these
committee
reports
credited
that.
mr.
randolph
we
think
so
or
any
other
animal
for
that
matter
or
stray
cats
for
that
matter
i
suppose
as
they
came
on
to
the
federal
land.
i
think
congress
said
in
the
taylor
grazing
act,
here
use
our
land
to
graze
cattle.
we
want
our
land
to
be
used
by
cattle.
all
they
said
in
this
act
is
“and
we
also
want
our
land
to
be
used
by
horses
and
burros”
and
they
wanted
an
interfere
with
that.
mr.
randolph
well,
that
would
only
be
true
if
the
burros
were
taking
up
or
the
horses
were
taking
up
and
grazing
in
an
area
where
the
cattle
would
otherwise
graze
in,
but
the
proportions
of
that,
we
are
talking,
the
latest
count
was
40,000
horses
and
i
believe
10,000
burros
in
a
report
that
congress
on
the
federal
public
land,
over
300,000,000
acres,
so
we
are
not
--
mr.
randolph
most
of
them
are
in
nevada,
most
of
the
horses
are
in
nevada,
but
in
the
state
of
new
mexico,
the
census
was
a
total
of
approximately
a
104
burros
on
the
federal
public
lands
and
64
of
them
were
claimed
by
individuals.
the
claims
are
still
being
processed.
they
claimed
that
they
owned
them
and
they
had
just
been
set
out.
if
their
claims
are
accepted,
they
have
to
pay
a
trespass
fee
to
let
the
animals
back.
the
congress
also
found
that
as
i
said
that
these
were
not
special
species
that
most
probably
they
have
escape
has
been
turned
out
within
the
last
century
or
even
during
the
depression
when
farmers
and
ranchers
pulled
up
stakes
and
left
for
the
cities.
mr.
randolph
they
can
live
as
long
as
60
years.
they
live
very,
very
long.
there
is
a
place
in
england
i
think
that
has
an
old
age
burro
at
home
or
something,
but
i
do
not
know.
one
of
the
things
that
congress
was
startled
about
is
that
not
only
studies
have
been
done
on
that
on
the
burros
and
on
there
lifespan
--
mr.
randolph
it
will
be
alive
today,
that
is
right
[laughter]
mr.
randolph
sorry?
mr.
randolph
and
i
lost.[laughter]
mr.
randolph
these
burros
were
not.
these
burros
were
not
found
on
private
land.
the
only
--
there
is
two
pieces
of
testimony
in
this
record.
one
is
the
rancher
said,
we
have
shown
a
map
of
this
area
and
he
said,
they
are
all
over
the
public
--
they
are
all
over
that
area.
well,
part
of
that
area
has
interspersed
private
land.
the
other
thing
he
says
is
cattle
are
free
to
roam
all
over
the
area
and
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
this
record,
but
i
like
to
get
just
one
other
point
out.
mr.
randolph
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
it
is.
mr.
randolph
we
do
not
think
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
nobody
has
claimed
it.
nobody
has
briefed
it.
nobody
has
argued
it.
it
has
not
been
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
in
part
of
the
complaint.
the
facts
underlying
the
case
do
not
show
that
if
it
ever
came
up
then
i
think
it
might
be
a
proper
issue.
we
would
claim
it
is.
mr.
randolph
section
4.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
mr.
randolph
and
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
i
said
this
was
the
legislation,
we
think
in
a
great
tradition.
the
congress
close
--
the
bill
has
originated
from
committees
are
off
the
property
clause.
the
bills
originated
from
committees
and
congress
that
are
composed
in
nearly
all
western
representatives
of
western
state.
this
is
unusual
legislation
and
passed
unanimously.
the
notion
that
it
upsets
a
great
tradition
of
the
state
is
rather
surprising
i
think.
if
there
is
a
tradition
of
controlling
these
animals,
it
is
the
tradition
of
the
indian
tribes
and
the
united
states
calvary
remount
service
controlling
the
animals,
not
the
traditional
state
control.
the
governor
of
nevada,
i
find
that
the
amicus
briefs
by
state
of
nevada
filed
here,
the
governor
of
nevada
wrote
a
letter
that
the
both
houses
of
congress
supporting
this
particular
piece
of
legislation.
the
--
mr.
randolph
well,
on
private
land,
i
think
there
is.
i
think
it
has
to
be
related
to
the
public
land.
if
they
live
all
they
lives
on
and
stepped
--
mr.
randolph
(inaudible)
mr.
randolph
i
do
not
think
so.
i
am
not
sure
depending
upon
the
state.
mr.
randolph
they
do.
mr.
randolph
traditionally,
the
federal
public
land,
the
game
in
the
federal
public
land
is
controlled
by
the
state
game
laws
while
the
habitat
is
managed
by
the
federal
government.
that
is
only
because
of
the
federal
government
is
letting
the
usual
customary
traditional
course
to
take
place.
mr.
randolph
no,
not
at
all.
the
federal
government
could
and
in
fact
has
with
respect
to
wild
life
refuges
and
with
respect
to
the
bird
sanctuaries
said
that
state
game
laws
shall
not
apply.
these
animals
shall
not
be
killed
at
any
time.
the
mule
deer
in
the
area
that
we
are
talking
about
here
in
the
federal
land
in
new
mexico,
the
quail
can
still
only
be
shot
i
would
suppose
if
someone
gets
a
state
hunting
license
and
goes
out
there.
mr.
randolph
no,
what
i
was
responding
to
is
the
contention
that
they
spend
the
majority
of
their
time
on
federal
or
on
private
land
and
also
the
contention
that
this
particular
rancher
saw
these
burros
on
private
land.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record.
they
may
have
wondered
--
mr.
randolph
no.
mr.
randolph
no,
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood
it.
they
were
--
it
is
not
disputed
in
this
record
that
these
burros
were
on
public
land
when
they
were
seized,
they
were
on
public
land,
when
they
were
discovered.
mr.
randolph
they
may
have
been
on
private
land
when
they
were
found.
mr.
randolph
no,
i
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
randolph
at
sometime,
but
how
long,
what
majority
is
--
what
amount
of
time
and
when?
mr.
randolph
we
would
contend
that
he
could
not
shoot
them
while
they
--
if
they
walked
across
by
the
--
mr.
randolph
that
is
right,
but
that
is
not
issue
now
we
think.
they
were
found
on
federal
public
land,
they
were
discovered
on
federal
public
land.
how
much
time
they
spent
on
the
piece
of
private
property
and
they
were
taken
from
federal
public
land
by
state
agents,
who
came
along
without
any
permission
from
the
bureau
of
land
management.
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
if
that
--
i
thought
it
said
on
public
lands.
mr.
randolph
if
there
was
a
period
after
that,
i
would
say
that
that
is
clearly
erroneous
and
not
supported
by
the
record.
he
found
these
burros;
he
discovered
these
burros
when
he
visited
bureau
of
land
management
office
where
they
showed
them
a
picture
of
them
around
the
taylor
well
which
is
all
in
federal
public
property.
mr.
randolph
yes,
how
much
time
they
spent
on
any
private
land
within
his
--
that
was
owned
by
him
or
any
body
else
i
suppose
is
not
shown
by
the
record.
for
all
i
know,
that
statement
they
were
found
on,
i
think
they
were
referred
to
his
private
land?
mr.
randolph
no,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
way
really
to
tell
the
difference
between
one
or
the
other,
at
least
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
randolph
according
to
and
surprisingly
enough,
according
to
the
bureau
of
land
management
on
the
federal
lands
of
new
mexico,
there
is
a
total
of
about
a
100
burros,
wild
burros,
that
is
all
and
out
of
them,
64
are
claimed
by
private
individuals
as
having
owned
them
even
though
they
maybe
unbranded,
so
very
few
in
new
mexico.
mr.
randolph
there
were
two
million
horses
at
one
time
within
the
western
plains
of
the
united
states.
those
numbers
dwindled.
the
congress
found
it
down
to
the
20,000
by
1971.
mr.
randolph
this
particular
permanent
is
not
in
the
record;
it
is
not
in
the
record.
now,
i
have
asked
the
bureau
of
land
management.
the
only
thing
so
as
far
as
i
am
aware
is
that
there
are
regulations
now
in
the
works
that
would
say
that
if
a
rancher
leasing
taylor
grazing
act
land
from
the
government
to
graze,
violates
the
wild-horses
act
that
his
lease
can
be
canceled.
so
far
as
i
am
aware
now,
that
is
not
written
into
his
permit.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
if
it
ever
comes
up
and
the
only
way
it
will
come
up
is
if
--
if
a
rancher
--
i
might
say
that
practice
of
having
animals
going
to
private
land,
wait
until
you
get
some
official
person
to
remove
them
is
a
traditional
practice
in
the
west.
if
you
look
at
the
new
mexico
estray
law,
even
a
private
landowner
in
new
mexico
cannot
say
he
sees
a
stray
animal
that
comes
onto
his
land,
he
cannot
take
the
gun
out
and
shoot
it.
he
is
prohibited
from
doing
that.
he
has
got
to
call
up
the
new
mexico
livestock,
would
not
get
their
permission
to
come
out
and
take
it
away
which
is
precisely
what
the
federal
act
does.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
i
do
not
think
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
