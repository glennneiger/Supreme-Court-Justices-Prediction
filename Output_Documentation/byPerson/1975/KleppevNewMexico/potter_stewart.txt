justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
the
private
land?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
its
practical
effect,
if
a
private
land
owner
sees
a
wild
burro
on
his
land
who
has
been,
in
his
opinion,
damaging
his
own
crops
and
his
own
stock
and
depriving
his
own
stock
of
food
and
all
these
other
things
that
are
alleged
in
the
amicus
brief,
and
just
decides
to
pick-up
his
rifle
and
shoot
him
and
there
is
no
proof
that
that
burro
has
ever
been
on
public
land?
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
the
other
hand
if
it
can
be
proved
that
burro
had
ever
set
foot
on
public
land,
then
what?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
not
flora,
these
are
fauna?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
allegation
that
he
first
asked
the
federal
authorities
to
please
remove
these?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
law,
the
private
landowner
could
have
requested
or
if
the
private
landowner
had
requested
the
federal
authorities
to
remove
the
burros,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
federal
authorities
to
do
so,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
permitee
under
the
taylor
act?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
so
called
feral
animal’s
though?
is
it
claimed
that
these
are
feral
animals?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
just
horses
and
donkeys
that
have
run
off
from
some
rancher’s
property?
justice
potter
stewart
feral
animals
are
wild
animals,
an
indigenous
wild
undomesticated
animal?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
i
may
remember
(inaudible)
feral,
wild?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
for
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
must
have
drawn
the
straws
for
this
case.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
statute
do
purport
to
control
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
people
can
do
to
burros
and
the
wild
horses
that
is
on
private
land?
justice
potter
stewart
now
before
us
and
all
we
have
now
is
the
basic
power
of
congress
to
enact
this
legislation
generally?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
in
mind
the
statement
that
--
which
justice
stevens
is
referring,
the
first
sentence
of
the
second
paragraph,
of
the
opinion
on
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
is
in
common
and
also
on
public
land,
but
he
was
referring
to
the
clause
that
comes
before
the
comment?
justice
potter
stewart
wondering
on
his
private
land
that
is
what
it
says
and
that
is
the
clause
to
which
mr.
justice
stevens
is
referring.
justice
potter
stewart
toomer
against
witsell
said
that
was
a
legal
fiction?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
on
a
national
park?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
read
differently
for
that
kind
of
land?
