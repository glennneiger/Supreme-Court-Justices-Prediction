justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
asking
if
the
law
covers
private
land,
and
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
support
for
the
statement
that
they
interfere
with
the
lessee's
property
on
public
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
the
lessee
(inaudible)
supplemental
feeding
that
he
puts
and
brings
on
the
public
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
just
say
that
wherever
you
are
grazing
cattle
on
the
public
land,
you
carry
salt
under
the
land.
you
frequently
carry
on
supplemental
feeding
on
to
the
land,
and
you
find
out
that
some
wild
burros
are
eating
up
your
supplemental
feeding.
now,
is
there
some
evidence
to
that
effect
in
this
record
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
say
anything
about
interfere
with
the
cows.
i
asked
you,
whether
they
are
eating
up
some
property
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
evidence
that
they
were
in
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
usual
or
not,
they
were
eating
up
his
protein
blocks?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
found
on
private
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
apparently,
you
would
think
it
would
make
no
difference
because
they
were
found
on
private
property
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
on
private
land
is
any
different
with
respect
to
these
burros
than
it
is
with
respect
to
deer
and
an
elk
insofar
as
the
state
purports
to
tell
a
landowner
do
not
shoot
elk
out
of
season
or
do
not
shoot
deer
out
of
season,
even
if
you
find
them
on
your
own
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
landowner
is
free
to
shoot
game
on
his
own
land
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
suppose
under
the
property
clause
of
the
united
states
could
condition
a
taylor
grazing
lease
on
the
lessees
not
shooting
burros
or
seizing
burros,
(inaudible)
off
its
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
this
land
i
suppose
would
be
taylor
grazing
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
common
way
of
referring
to
your
ranch?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
found
on
your
ranch,
you
do
not
know
whether
it
was
found
on
the
taylor
grazing
land
or
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
all
it
says
whether
they
--
when
the
first
found
them,
they
were
--
did
he
ever
find
them
on
his
fee
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
those
burros
he
never
knew
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whatsoever
that
these
burros
were
ever
found
on
his
fee
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
suggest
that
this
case
raises
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
issue
--
what
the
complaint
was
about
was
that
this
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
these
19
burros
were
taken
from
public
land
and
sold?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
does
not
the
united
states
say
that
whoever
owns
the
burros,
in
one
of
their
answers
anyway,
is
whoever
owns
the
burros,
the
united
states
can
certainly
keep
people
from
taking
the
burros
from
the
public
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
deny
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we
agree
with
the
united
states
on
that
issue,
would
we
need
to
go
any
further?
let
us
assume
we
agree
to
the
united
states
that
whoever
owns
the
burros,
the
united
states
may
present
their
being
taken
from
the
public
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
--
would
the
case
be
over
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
they
well
--
that
maybe
so,
but
the
act
also
covers
burros
on
private
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
that
adjudicated
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
justice
stevens
says,
it
is
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
suggested
or
asked
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
--
you
have
same
answer
--
do
you
have
the
same
answer
for
deer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that,
that
really
means
that
the
state
owns
them
whether
they
are
owners
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
that
they
are
not
owned
by
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
something
more
and
that
the
state
has
power
to
regulate
the
hunting
or
killing
of
them?
i
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
you
mean
to
actually
own
the
animals
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
authority
for
the
fact
that
the
state
owns
the
animals
rather
than
just
having
the
power
to
regulate
the
taking
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
wild
animals
--
that
these
are
wild
animals
--
