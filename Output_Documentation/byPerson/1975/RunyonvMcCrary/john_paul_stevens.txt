mr.
brown,
before
you
get
started
again,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understood
one
point
about
your
reply
brief
and
the
question
of
the
elimination
of
the
language
trying
to
seek
out
the
attention
of
congress
in
1866,
the
elimination
of
the
language
of
the
other
civil
rights
claim.
as
i
understood,
your
position
it
is
that
you
acknowledge
that
the
elimination
of
that
language
evidences
an
intent
not
to
have
the
statute
apply
to
state
operated
integrated
schools?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
leaves
open
the
question
whether
it
applies
to
privately
operated
schools?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
do
you
think
it
is
probable
that
congress
would
have
first
legislated
against
private
discrimination
and
secondly
reserved
the
question
of
public
integration?
i
am
just
trying
to
get
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
to
summarize
it
once
more,
what
you
are
saying,
i
understand
the
point
that
the
deliberation
over
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
focused
on
the
state
action
and
therefore
that
problem
might
have
been
reserved,
but
you
must
be
saying
if
you
understand
it
correctly
that
if
we
use
the
phrase
“badge
of
slavery.”
that
private
discrimination
in
school
--
the
discrimination
in
private
schools
would
be
badge
of
slavery
but
discrimination
in
a
public
operated
schools
would
not
be
a
badge
of
slavery
within
the
thirteenth
amendment
framework?
