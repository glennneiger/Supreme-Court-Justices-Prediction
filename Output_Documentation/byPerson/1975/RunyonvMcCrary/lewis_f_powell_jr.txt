justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
light
of
your
comment
that
you
have
construe
1981
as
applying
only
to
racial
discrimination,
does
that
suggest
that
you
disagree
with
counsel
for
petitioner
who
stated
here
15-20
minutes
ago
that
if
you
prevail,
the
principle
would
apply
to
all
girls’
schools
and
all
boys’
schools?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
your
view
of
1981
does
not
embrace
whites
or
the
rights
of
whites?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
it
would
not
apply
in
your
view
to
all
boys’
school
and
all
girls’
school,
so
that
the
opposite
sex
would
have
a
contractual
right
to
enter?
