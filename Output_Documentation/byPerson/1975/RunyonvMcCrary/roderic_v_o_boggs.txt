mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
additional
issues
which
i
would
like
to
address
this
afternoon.
the
first
concern
is
the
award
of
attorney’s
fees
in
this
case
are
the
district
court
which
is
subsequently
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
second
involves
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
to
be
applied
to
a
1981
action
brought
in
the
state
of
virginia.
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
applied
a
two-year
personal
injury
statute
of
limitations
and
petitioners
seek
to
apply
the
five-year
statute
of
limitation.
turning
first
to
the
question
of
attorney’s
fees,
we
submit
that
there
are
two
bases
under
which
attorney’s
fees
could
appropriately
be
supported
as
an
award
in
this
case.
the
first
involves
the
application
of
the
bad
faith
exception
of
the
american
rule
and
the
second
involves
a
finding
of
an
explicit
statutory
authorization
to
award
fees
of
the
section
1988
of
42
u.s.
code.
before
discussing
the
attorney
fee
issue,
however,
in
detail
with
these
theories,
i
would
like
to
note
briefly
the
matter
in
which
the
attorney
fee
question
was
raised
in
the
course
of
this
litigation.
we
take
it
is
quite
important
to
note
that
in
this
case
the
district
court
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
awarded
$2,000.00
in
attorney’s
fees
without
however
hearing
argument
on
this
question
and
without
making
any
specific
findings
as
to
the
basis
for
the
awarded
fees.
it
is
also
of
course,
important
to
note
that
case
arose
before
this
court’s
decision
in
alyeska.
on
appeal,
only
the
private
attorney
general
theory
was
brief
and
argued.
subsequently
in
the
fourth
circuit’s
opinion
on
this
case,
the
private
attorney
general
theory
was
held
in
applicable
and
by
4:3
margin
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
no
bad
faith
was
present
on
the
record
before.
i
would
think
possibly
important
to
the
court
was
the
absence
of
any
findings
of
bad
faith,
it
made
explicitly
by
the
district
court.
we
would
note
however
that
the
general
pattern
which
has
been
seen
in
cases
considered
by
circuit
courts
since
this
court’s
decision
in
alyeska
has
seen
remand
to
district
courts
and
circumstances
where
the
private
attorney
general
theory
had
been
utilized
to
award
fees,
but
no
basis
for
bad
faith
had
been
explicitly
recognized
and
discussed
by
courts
of
appeals.
we
would
therefore
suggest
that
at
a
minimum
in
this
case
based
on
the
record,
a
remand
would
be
necessary
and
should
this
court
be
unable
to
agree
with
our
conclusions
in
the
record
that
bad
faith
is
amply
been
made
out
before
the
district
court.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
i
would
like
to
turn
now
specifically
to
the
question
of
bad
faith
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
bad
faith
in
this
case
is
constituted
not
by
the
defense
by
the
schools
of
what
they
believe
to
be
their
constitutional
rights
to
refuse
admission
to
black
students,
but
more
by
the
matter
in
which
they
have
asserted
this
defense.
specifically
by
the
repeated
denials
under
oath
of
having
it
refused
to
admit
these
children
on
the
basis
of
their
race,
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
it
quite
important
in
considering
this
question
in
finding
and
stating
that
they
believe
faults
of
perception
and
memory
could
have
accounted
for
the
testimony
that
was
given
on
several
occasions
by
the
defendant’s
witnesses.
we,
however,
submit
that
a
review
of
a
record
of
this
case
will
show
that
there
is
no
question
of
perception
or
memory
in
the
conduct
of
the
defendants.
quite
the
contrary
is
true
in
the
case
of
the
gonzales
children
and
the
fairfax-brewster
school
in
particular.
there
was
testimony
by
three
members
of
the
staff
of
that
school
that
they
remember
fully
the
circumstances
under
which
colin
gonzales
applied.
they
remembered
that
he
had
been
rejected
not
because
of
his
race
because
they
claimed
there
was
no
policy
of
racial
discrimination.
but
rather
they
claimed
that
he
was
rejected
because
he
had
not
had
sufficient
pre-school
experience.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
that
is
witnesses
but
it
is
also
--
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
the
parties
i
think
in
this
instances
mark
the
same,
three
individuals
involved
where
the
directors,
in
fact,
constitute
the
administration
entirely
at
the
school.
we
would
submit
your
honor
that
this
testimony
under
oath
cannot
be
accounted
for
on
the
basis
of
perception
in
memory
and
in
fact
can
only
be
seen
as
a
deliberate
attempt
find
the
defendant
to
deceive
the
court
and
to
protract
this
litigation.
it
must
be
remembered
that
as
a
result
of
that
testimony
or
result
of
that
position
--
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
no,
we
would
disagree
with
that
your
honor,
there
certainly
is
--
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
they
asserted
a
constitutional
--
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
absolutely.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
they
did
assert
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
we
do
not
submit
that
there
is
any
bad
faith
in
their
assertion
of
a
constitutional
right.
the
bad
faith
in
this
case
comes
not
from
the
constitutional
defense
but
the
manner
in
which
they
denied
the
underlying
facts
of
discrimination
under
oath
and
in
a
way
which
cannot
possibly
in
our
judgment
be
caught
by
failures
of
perception
in
memory.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
was
ample
case
authority
from
this
court
and
from
the
circuits
which
distinguish
quite
clearly
between
litigation
and
conduct
to
giving
this
ingenious
testimony.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
i
do
not
believe
you
could
take
two,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
did
review
this
record
without
th
benefit
of
findings
from
the
district
court.
the
district
court
has,
you
pointed
out
initially,
made
and
reached
its
conclusions,
we
believe,
on
the
basis
of
the
private
attorney
general
theory
made
no
findings
to
the
credibility
at
this
point
in
explicit
sense.
however,
we
would
note
that
in
commenting
on
this
testimony
of
three
witnesses,
the
three
administrator
people
from
the
fairfax-brewster
school,
the
district
court
explicitly
found
that
the
court
rejects
this
testimony
as
unbelievable
and
finds
that
the
reason
for
the
rejection
was
because
colin
gonzalez
was
black.
in
other
words,
we
are
saying
that
this
court
in
fact
that
make
quite
clear
in
the
case
of
hall
v.
cole
several
years
ago,
that
in
determining
and
looking
at
bad
faith,
we
must
distinguish
between
deceptive
litigation
conducts
and
the
putting
forward
of
a
constitutional
defense
of
some
kind.
that
distinction,
we
think
is
very
clear
in
this
case
and
if
you
review
the
record
carefully
i
think
we
submit
you
will
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
we
but
there
is
a
distinction
here.
we
are
not
questioning
the
right
of
either
of
these
schools
to
make
constitutional
defense.
we
have
claimed
though
that
they
have
not
done
just
that.
they
have
extended
this
litigation
unduly,
put
us
through
a
necessity
of
interrogatories,
a
two-day
trial
on
the
question
of
discrimination
itself,
not
the
constitutional
aspect
to
the
case
and
required
us
beyond
that
to
pursue
this
question
of
credibility
onto
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
fact,
if
listen
to
argument
of
counsel
for
the
schools
this
morning,
i
would
submit
the
question
of
credibility
and
still
being
argued
to
some
extent
by
them.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
well,
i
think
if
this
court
is
not
convinced
the
way
we
are,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
appropriate
courts
would
be
to
send
this
case
back
to
the
trial
court.
after
all,
bad
faith,
as
in
many
cases,
we
cite
some
of
them
make
it
clear,
when
bad
faith
is
an
issue,
the
court
relies
heavily
upon
trial
court
decision,
in
fact
the
cases
has
made
clear
that
in
the
absence
of
clearly
erroneous
judgments
by
the
trial
court,
a
finding
of
bad
faith
must
be
sustained
on
appeal.
the
problem
here
is
simply
that
that
was
not
made.
we
suggest
the
record
leads
to
that
conclusion.
there
was
obviously
difference
of
opinion
on
that
question,
and
if
this
court
disagrees
with
us,
we
think
of
remand
on
that
question
would
be
required.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
oh
yes,
it
was
decided
at
the
initial
court
of
appeals.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
almost
simultaneously.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
there
was
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
i
am
not
sure
it
was
based
on
alyeska.
it
was
before
alyeska
but
during
that
time
the
petition
was
pending,
alyeska
was
handed
down
and
for
that
reason
the
three
judges
in
dissent
who
would
raise
the
private
attorney
general
theory
withdrew
that
aspect
of
their
opinion
but
maintained
their
position
in
regard
to
bad
faith.
i
would
also
suggest
your
honor
that
in
looking
at
bad
faith,
this
court
has,
at
least
on
one
occasion,
made
it
clear
that
it
is
particularly
sensitive
to
questions
of
bad
faith
and
matters
of
racial
discrimination.
and
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
its
decision
in
newman
versus
piggy
park
enterprises
where
the
court
in
the
footnote,
footnote
5,
i
believe,
specifically
cited
as
an
example
of
bad
faith,
the
raising
of
a
defense
regarding
the
denial
of
discrimination
which
was
subsequently
withdrawn
prior
to
trial
and
cited
that
is
an
example
of
vexatious
litigation
tactics.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
that
is
right.
i
think
that
this
court
does
not
agree
with
our
interpretation
of
that
which
in
our
judgment
is
in
a
fortiori
situation.
in
other
words,
maintaining
a
vexatious
defense
even
to
trial,
the
proper
courses
of
remand
on
that
issue.
the
second
theory
which
we
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
justifies
the
award
of
attorney’s
fees
in
this
case.
this
is
found
in
the
examination
of
section
1988
of
42
u.s.
code,
the
section
was
originally
the
third
section
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act.
we
submit
that
1988
provides
for
this
court
the
specific
legislative
guidance
which
after
alyeska
appears
to
be
required
in
order
to
find
the
authority
to
grant
attorney’s
fees
absent
one
of
the
generally
recognized
exceptions
to
the
american
rule.
as
this
court,
i
believe
is
familiar
from
its
decisions
in
other
case
dealing
with
1988,
the
language
of
that
provisions
speaks
in
terms
of
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
in
civil
rights
cases
being
exercise
in
conformity
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
so
far
as
such
laws
are
suitable
to
carrying
the
same
into
effect.
to
the
extent
that
those
laws
are
not
fully
adapted,
the
court
may
then
look
to
state
laws
modified
by
common
law
as
long
as
it
is
consistent
with
the
federal
law.
we
believe
that
this
section
provides
an
explicit
invitation
to
seek
remedies
to
make
fully
effective
to
the
1866
act,
and
in
fact
other
civil
rights
provisions
of
chapter
21
of
42
u.s.c.
we
would
also
like
to
submit
and
state
that
this
court
has
recognized
the
ability
that
it
possesses
to
apply
the
1866
act,
section
1988
to
draw
a
confederal
law
to
make
fully
whole
victims
of
discrimination
in
determining
appropriate
relief
and
remedies.
and
we
would
cite
for
that
proposition
the
case
of
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
in
which
the
court
and
i
quote
stated
“as
we
read
section
1988,
both
federal
and
state
rules
on
damages
may
be
utilize
whichever
best
serves
the
policies
expressed
in
the
federal
statute.”
we,
therefore,
suggest
that
it
is
inappropriate
course
for
this
court
to
follow
to
draw
upon
the
private
attorney
general
provisions
of
later
inactive
statutes
which
allow
for
the
award
of
attorney’s
fees
in
civil
rights
cases.
we
think,
no
less
is
required
to
fully
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act.
finally,
your
honors
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
question
of
the
statute
limitations
that
had
been
applied
in
this
case.
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
applied
in
this
case,
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
which
is
taken
from
the
personal
injury
provisions
of
virginia
code
section
8-24.
this
section
which
had
first
been
applied
in
1972
in
the
case
of
almond
versus
kent,
that
being
a
1983
action
involving
a
suit
in
which
a
citizen
had
been
beaten
allegedly
by
the
police
was
in
fact
a
personal
injury
case,
a
physical
injury
case
as
well
as
the
constitutional
case.
the
court
in
that
instance
was
choosing
between
the
application
of
the
two-year
limit
for
personal
injuries
and
a
one-year
limit
based
on
transitory
torts.
it
chose
in
a
way
that
was
quite
helpful
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
a
the
two-year
limit.
subsequently,
the
logic
applied
in
that
case
to
1983
action
has
been
applied
to
section
1981
and
1982
actions.
although
of
course
they
do
not
involved
necessarily
and
normally
do
not
involved
explicit
physical
injury.
we
submit
that
the
classification
--
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
no,
we
absolutely
agree
with
that
your
honor.
we
think
that
is
one
reason
--
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
precisely
that
is
exactly
the
reason
why
we
think
neither
1981
nor
1982
nor
1983
action
should
be
equated
for
purposes
of
analogy
with
the
physical
personal
injury.
we
would
state
here
parenthetically
that
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
virginia,
law
application
within
the
state
of
virginia,
that
two-year
limit
to
the
best
of
our
ability
to
research
the
question
is
only
applied
to
the
cases
of
physical
bodily
injury
and
there
is
no
case
that
has
been
cited
to
us
in
opposing
briefs
or
that
we
have
been
able
to
research
which
applies
any
place
except
in
the
area
of
civil
rights.
now,
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
think
that
in
searching
for
the
most
analogous
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
of
course
the
federal
courts
are
obliged
to
take
and
federal
statutes
are
silent
on
that
question.
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
second
section
of
that
virginia
statute,
which
specifies
that
in
personal
actions
for
which
no
limit
is
otherwise
prescribed,
a
five-year
limit
should
be
adapted
if
the
cause
of
action
is
found
to
survive
and
a
one-year
limit
is
to
be
applied
if
the
cause
does
not
survive.
we
would,
applying
that
analysis,
suggest
that
a
five-year
statute
is
dictated
our
virtual
effect
that
even
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
almond
versus
kent
in
the
first
instance,
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
federal
right
under
1983,
and
we
would
suggest
under
1981
and
1982
as
well,
would
survive
on
the
basis
of
generally
accepted
federal
principles.
because
of
that
your
honor,
we
suggest
that
the
appropriate
resolution
of
this
case
on
the
statute
of
limitations
is
to
hold
that
for
purposes
of
analogy
in
the
state
of
virginia,
the
five-year
statute
of
limitations
is
the
appropriate
one
to
be
applied.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
boggs
that
is
right.
the
way
this
issue
arises
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
gonzalez
family
the
parents
were
not
entitled
to
rule,
not
able
to
bring
this
case,
because
statute
limitations
has
barred
them,
and
they
filed
the
suit
three-and-a-half
years
approximately
after
the
cause
of
action
arose.
mr.
roderic
v.
o.
