mr.
geo
s.
leonard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
george
leonard.
i
represent
an
intervenor
on
the
district
court
by
the
name
of
the
southern
independent
school
association,
approximately
375
schools
and
approximately
175,000
children.
the
factual
discussions
which
the
court
has
heard
up
to
this
point
do
not
affect
this
particular
intervenor.
we
stipulated
with
mr.
brown
in
the
lower
court
that
these
schools
do
in
fact,
without
any
question,
discriminate
against
negroes
because
of
their
color.
and
exactly
the
same
sets
that
a
black
school
may
discriminate
against
whites
because
of
his
color
or
a
chinese
or
a
french
school
or
any
other
kind
of
school.
we
do
it.
we
have
stipulated
that
the
majority
of
the
schools
represented
by
this
particular
association
actually
have
that
particular
limitation
on
their
admission.
so
the
factual
question
of
whether
we
do
or
do
not
is
not
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
intervenor
is
concerned.
the
issue
as
it
was
stated
by
both
the
majority
and
minority
in
the
fourth
circuit,
we
believe
to
be
too
narrow.
they
said
the
issue
was,
is
an
otherwise
qualified
black
child
entitled
to
be
admitted
to
any
school
of
his
choice,
a
private
school.
the
actual
issue
in
this
case
is
much
broader
than
that.
it
comes
up
under
1981
and
involves
the
first
amendment
and
the
freedom
of
association.
the
actual
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
any
child
of
any
color
may
attend
any
school
of
his
choice.
if
he
is
a
boy,
may
he
attend
the
girls’
school?
if
he
is
a
jew,
may
he
attend
the
catholic
school?
if
he
is
a
chinese,
may
he
attend
the
school
for
mexican-americans?
the
question
is
truly
and
about
as
broad
as
this
court
sought
to
be
back
in
the
pierce
case.
namely
just
how
far
do
the
options
of
a
parent
go
in
trying
to
decide
what
kind
of
education
that
child
will
have?
now
i
hold
no
brief
here.
this
intervenor
does
not
make
any
claim
that
its
parents
are
right
and
other
parents
are
wrong.
that
white
children
alone
should
gather
and
all
other
should
be
mixed.
we
stand
for
the
proposition
and
we
claim
it
before
this
court
and
we
have
claimed
that
before
courts
below
that
every
parent
with
a
school
child
in
this
country
may
select
a
school
that
that
parent
believes,
given
some
basic
mathematical
and
reading
ability,
that
that
parent
believes
will
develop
the
child
into
the
kind
of
person
that
the
parent
wants
it
to
be.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
well,
as
i
said,
there
is
a
minimum
requirement.
this
court
had,
not
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
in
i
think
of
a
very
illustrative
case
held
that
the
use
of
poisonous
snakes
in
religious
--
well,
it
does
have
an
analogy
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
stop
and
think
of
at
this
way,
how
far
must
religion
be
allowed
to
go?
how
far
must
race
be
allowed
to
go?
there
was
a
zionist
church
and
school
in
illinois
many,
many
years
ago
and
they
taught
that
the
earth
was
flat
and
the
question
was
whether
they
could
so
teach?
at
that
time,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
upheld.
since
then,
this
court
has
issued
its
holdings
on
the
question
of
evolution
cannot
be
stopped
by
a
state.
the
teacher
must
be
allowed
to
teach
evolution.
certain
basic
mathematics,
we
have
in
the
rodriguez
opinion
from
this
court
for
example,
the
question
of
whether
education
itself
is
not
a
constitutional
right
but
there
is
some
sort
of
amorphous
beginning
of
education,
probably
the
ability
to
read
and
write
and
do
simple
sums
which
every
child
is
entitled
to.
if
a
school
does
not
provide
that,
i
think
it
would
be
completely
and
utterly
proper
for
the
state
to
say
we
will
not
qualify
you,
we
will
not
justify
you.
but
if
you
give
them
the
basic
education
then
what
you
give
them
in
addition
to
that
whether
it
is
religious
training,
whether
it
is
training
for
home
economics
for
girls
in
the
girls
school,
whether
it
is
bricklaying
for
boys
in
the
boys
school,
it
makes
no
difference
provided
that
the
fundamental
education
at
the
core
is
given.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
you
are
quite
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
if
they
said
so,
what
i
am
trying
to
address
myself
to
at
this
moment
is
exactly
that
point.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
this
point
was
made
in
point
five
of
the
brief
of
this
intervenor.
it
has
never
been
answered
by
any
responding
brief.
i
do
not
believe
it
can
be
answered
and
it
goes
directly
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question.
if
a
person
wants
an
integrated
education,
public,
private
or
otherwise,
is
he
entitled
to
get
it?
and
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
if
we
had
schools
which
we
was
so
located
in
the
united
states
for
the
child
who
could
not
get
into
them
could
not
be
educated,
i
think
we
would
have
a
very
difficult
case
on
our
hands.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
no,
i
do
not
go
that
far
at
all.
i
do
feel
that
there
is
some
fundamental
type
of
education
that
every
child
in
the
united
states
is
entitled
to.
how
far
does
it
go?
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
how
far
can
the
state
go?
for
example,
some
states
have
passed
laws;
i
believe
wisconsin
is
one
of
them,
that
every
private
school
in
the
state
must
be
integrated.
let
us
take
that
as
an
example.
suppose
they
have
a
law
which
says
that
every
private
school
in
the
state
must
be
racially
integrated
but
not
otherwise,
would
that
be
valid?
i
really
do
not
know
the
answer
because
it
is
not
the
case
which
arises
on
the
facts
on
this
record.
i
think
it
is
a
very
difficult
question
to
raise
as
to
whether
you
can
take
one
particular
form
of
discrimination
and
say
that
you
cannot
have
like
the
teaching
of
germany.
the
court
will
recall,
you
had
a
decision
many
years
ago
in
burgos
(ph)
when
the
state
of
iowa
tried
to
prevent
the
teaching
of
german
in
schools,
because
of
world
war
i
presume,
and
this
court
held
that
you
could
not
prevent
that
type
of
teaching.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
as
a
matter
of
fact,
yes;
i
do
believe
it
is
good
law
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
that
there
are
certain
things
of
a
fundamentally
academic
nature
which
a
state
cannot
take
away.
now,
if
we
look
at
the
yoder
decision
for
example,
the
state
insisted
that
these
children
go
on
beyond
a
certain
degree
of
time
and
this
court
held
that
when
they
were
returned
to
the
mennonite
community,
the
amish
community
there,
they
did
in
fact
received
equivalent
instruction.
now
it
might
be
amish
instruction,
it
might
be
mennonite
instruction
but
it
was
equivalent
instruction
so
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
state
could
not
take
the
position
that
education
shall
be
vest
itself.
it
is
like
the
pregnancy
case,
you
cannot
fix
an
absolute
line
and
say
above
or
below
that
is
valid
unless
there
is
a
good
reason
for
it.
now,
i
think
the
german;
there
would
be
no
good
reason
for.
german
is
a
fairly
well
used
language.
evolution,
this
court
held,
there
was
no
good
reason
to
stop
its
teaching.
now
we
come
down
to
the
question
of
whether
a
child
is
entitled
to
an
integrated
education.
250,000
black
children
in
the
united
states
attend
private
schools,
quarter
of
a
million
of
them.
how
many
attend
all
black
schools?
i
do
not
know.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
yes
your
honor.
it
is
in
sedalia,
north
carolina.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
the
academy
of
sedalia,
north
carolina,
very
good
one
it
is
too.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
is
a
100%
black
school.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
well,
like
the
gentleman
who
we
were
with
up
this
morning,
i
do
not
know
what
exclusion
means
that
nobody
makes
an
application?
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
alright,
then
the
black
muslim
--
i
think
the
black
muslim
schools
would
do
for
that.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
not
as
of
a
month
ago.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
as
of
today,
they
now
have
one
white
member
i
believe.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
the
black
muslim
movement,
but
they
do
have
schools
and
those
--
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
hmm?
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
i
do
not
know.
all
i
know
is
--
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
you
mean
non-religious?
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
i
do
not
really
know
that
i
can.
the
eleven
schools
in
mississippi
that
were
all
black
that
we
talked
about
in
the
case
down
there,
were
i
believe
parochial
schools.
i
believe
the
ones
that
were
spoken
off
in
philadelphia,
in
the
lemon
brief
were
again
parochial
school.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
i
can
imagine
that
your
honor
because
they
do
seem
to
attend.
i
cannot
say
that
i
am
in
favor
of
it,
but
they
do.
i
think
that
any
child
who
goes
into
a
school
which
is
99.9%
of
a
different
color
is
really
expressing
something.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
i
believe
there
is.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
come
to
if
i
may,
if
i
find
the
time
your
honor
is
that
the
decisions
in
this
country,
and
i
may
say
frankly
of
this
court,
have
divided
discrimination
into
malign
and
benign.
i
believe
that
the
word
of
this
court
in
one
case
was
invidious
discrimination
and
another
case
was
benevolent.
mr.
justice
white
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
took
a
case
and
note,
i
think
it
was
in
wheeler
versus
barrera
and
mr.
justice
douglas
did
as
well
that
the
decision
in
that
case
which
gave
government
funding
to
parochial
schools,
which
is
essentially
a
total
denial
of
the
situation
which
existed
in
the
tuition
grant
cases.
in
this
particular
court
in
which
tuition
grants
cases
by
the
states
were
denied
white
schools.
are
these
forms
of
discrimination
on
the
same
level,
they
arise
from
essentially
the
same
thing,
if
you
read
--
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
i
am
sorry.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
well,
i
do
not.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
we
do
not.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
the
bob
jones
university
situation
which
you
had
before
you
–-
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
and
the
dave
christian
situations
are
the
ones
where
the
exclusion
of
other
colors
has
done
for
religious
grounds.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
that
is
no
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
the
question
is
whether
just
the
parent
has
the
right
any
way.
so
if
i
may
come
back
for
the
moment.
we
have
an
amicus
in
this
case
by
the
name
of
the
council
for
american
private
education.
it
claims
to
represent
90%
of
all
the
private
schools
in
the
united
states.
those
90%
of
private
schools
in
the
united
states
are,
according
to
that
brief,
totally
integrated.
we
have
16,000
private
schools
roughly
speaking
in
the
united
states.
90%
of
all
children
attend
integrated
public
schools,
10%
of
all
children
in
the
united
states
attend
private
schools.
of
the
10%
of
the
private
schools,
90%
go
to
religious
schools.
i
do
not
know
whether
they
are
integrated
or
not
in
a
racial
sense.
they
are
certainly
integrated
in
a
religious
sense.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
i
do
not
believe
that
a
practicing
roman
catholic
would
make
a
good
jewish
rabbi
and
there
are
schools
for
both.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
religiously,
they
are
very
definitely
segregated.
they
maybe
i
think
--
i
believe
the
catholic
church
takes
the
position
is
totally
integrated
racially.
of
the
10%
of
children
that
go
to
private
schools,
90%
of
them
go
to
religious
schools,
10%
go
to
everything
else
there
is.
now
we
have
indian
schools,
we
have
chinese
schools,
we
have
black
schools,
we
have
french
schools,
and
we
have
german
schools.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
if
i
may
to
the
list
which
we
put
into
the
record
appearing
at
page
168
of
the
appendix.
now,
we
just
took
the
33,000
names
in
the
tax
exempt
lists
and
picked
out
the
first
hundred
we
came
to,
which
apparently
would
definitely
educational
organizations
catering
to
one
particular
ethnic
religious
or
other
type
of
group.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
page
168
of
the
appendix.
in
short
gentlemen,
99%
of
all
schools
in
the
united
states
are
totally
integrated
in
a
racial
sense.
1%
is
not
and
that
is
divided
up
into
every
form
that
you
can
think
of.
yet
there
are
enough
of
these
schools,
one
place
or
another
that
every
single
parent
still
has
some
control
over
the
education
of
a
child.
if
she
believes
in
a
particular
type
of
association
she
can
find
it.
i
have
already
broached
on
the
subject
of
the
division
between
the
courts
which
is
growing.
the
second
circuit
was
very
frank
about.
in
the
whites
and
jackson
case
they
said,
let
everybody
know
we
used
a
double
standard
for
determining
state
action.
if
it
is
religious
discrimination,
we
do
not
find
state
action,
if
it
is
racial
discrimination,
we
do
find
state
action.
in
the
workama
(ph)
case
which
was
just
reversed
two
weeks
ago
in
the
third
circuit,
they
held
that
as
long
as
the
city
of
philadelphia
maintained
the
co-educational
high
schools,
it
could
maintain
a
public
boys’
high
school
and
girls’
high
school.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
none
whatever
as
far
as
i
know,
it
was
never
raised
as
a
question
below,
and
as
far
as
i
know
even
the
tax
exemption
have
been
taken
away
from
these
particular
schools.
so
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is,
in
every
type
of
discrimination
involved
and
discrimination
at
one
time
was
a
good
word.
when
i
stand
here
to
use
it,
i
do
not
mean
that
this
is
necessarily
a
horrible
thing
in
a
country
which
is
essentially
a
pluralistic
country.
the
discrimination
between
the
subjects,
between
people,
between
the
meals
you
eat,
between
the
types
of
things
you
drink,
the
words
you
use,
and
the
people
you
associate
with.
inevitably
there
is
discrimination
in
virtually
every
element
of
life.
now
when
we
come
down
to
the
question
of
putting
a
child
in
school,
if
that
child
is
black,
he
can
go
to
an
integrated
school,
a
black
school
or
a
public
school
which
is
always
integrated.
if
he
happens
to
be
spanish
surname,
there
are
whole
series
of
private
schools
which
he
can
attend
or
he
can
attend
an
integrated
school
or
he
can
attend
a
public
school.
there
is
still
a
virtual
choice
for
a
parent
in
this
country
to
find
the
school.
now,
there
may
exist
situations
where
the
only
school
in
a
given
area,
the
only
school
there
is
within
reachable
area
is
a
one
particular
type.
in
that
case,
you
have
a
different
problem.
the
whole
question
of
reasonableness
is
gone.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
right.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
correct.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
those
are
the
only
two
issues?
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
but
you
see
19
–-
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
precisely.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
we
have
two
questions
really.
first,
1981
and
if
that
answers
it,
we
have
nothing
more.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
second,
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
1981
cannot
override.
mr.
geo
s.
leonard
so
that
if
the
right
exist
under
either
to
have
these
schools
--
sorry,
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
