mr.
louis
koutoulakos
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices,
i
represent
the
bobbe's
school
which
is
mr.
and
mrs.
runyon
operating.
i
will
limit
my
argument
to
the
narrow
areas
of
what
i
considered
the
crucial
issue
in
this
case
and
if
necessary
we
will
rebut
on
the
point
of
statute
of
limitations
on
the
right
of
attorney’s
fees.
now
first,
let
me
touch
on
the
facts
a
little
bit
as
to
the
reason
why
we
are
here.
the
bobbe’s
school
is
a
small
school
in
arlington,
virginia
and
in
fairfax,
virginia.
it
is
like
the
only
line
that
operates
a
private
school.
it
has
been
stipulated
in
the
facts
that
here
at
the
school
is
not
supported
in
anyway
by
any
federal
or
state
money
and
it
depends
entirely
on
the
support
upon
the
student
enrolment.
insofar
as
the
bobbe’s
school
is
concerned
--
now
this
case
was
consolidated
with
the
brewster
school
--
but
insofar
as
the
bobbe’s
school
is
concerned,
mr.
and
mrs.
mccrary
and
mr.
and
mrs.
gonzales
testified
and
of
course
this
is
unrebutted
that
as
a
result
of
a
telephone
call,
it
is
by
both
parties,
one
in
69
and
one
in
71
or
2
as
i
recall.
and
no
further
contact
and
no
formal
application,
as
a
result
of
a
telephone
call,
it
brought
into
play
the
section
1981,
the
civil
rights
act
that
we
are
now
hereon.
and
the
court
upon
hearing
evidence
--
and
there
is
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
in
the
dissent
found
in
the
greenough,
but
what
i
am
going
to
say
that
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
made
out
a
case.
it
certainly
did
not
rebut
the
fact
that
there
are
selected
standards
of
exclusion
by
our
school.
there
is
no
evidence
contrary
to
that.
i
think
that
all
the
evidence
is
clear
that
no
one
would
be
admitted
on
the
basis
of
a
phone
call.
there
has
to
be
a
formal
application
and
certain
admission
policies
that
are
necessary,
such
as
the
medical
examination
or
personal
interview
with
the
parent
and
based
on
that,
then
it
is
determined
as
to
whether
not
the
person
is
to
be
admitted.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
bedrock
or
what
the
plaintiffs
are
relied
upon
to
be
here
is
the
jones
case.
first,
starting
off
with
section
1981,
i
just
quote
it
briefly,
it
says
that,
“all
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
in
every
state
and
territory
to
make
an
enforce
contracts,
to
sue,
be
parties,
give
evidence,
and
to
the
full
and
equal
benefit
of
all
laws
and
proceedings
for
the
security
of
persons
and
property
as
it
enjoyed
by
white
citizens.”
now,
i
will
jump
to
the
jones
case,
because
as
i
said
that
seems
to
be
the
foundation
of
private
discrimination
and
really
that
is
what
i
think
we
are
hereon.
now,
first
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
make
this
observation.
being
of
great
heritage,
it
is
not
a
question
whether
i
agree
or
do
not
agree
with
respective
policies.
i
am
here
as
mr.
justice
marshall
used
to
in
the
old
days,
support
individual
rights
and
his
battle
to
eliminate
abuses.
well,
i
am
here
in
support
of
an
individual
right
of
a
citizen
in
this
country
or
any
person
in
this
country,
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
right
to
freely
choose
his
associates.
now
the
jones
case
says
that
private
discrimination,
at
least
in
contract
matters,
is
barred
by
the
constitution.
now,
without
getting
in
the
place
whether
i
agree
or
do
not
agree
with
that
decision,
i
do
not
want
to
say
that
that
decision
can
be
distinguished.
first,
if
we
get
to
the
1883
civil
rights
cases,
i
think
in
those
cases,
this
honorable
court,
there
determined
that
congress
is
limited
as
to
what
it
can
do
under
certain
basic
rights
that
transcend
and
militate
against
the
rights
of
congress
or
any
other
political
body
to
regulate
against.
and
i
am
talking
about
the
freedom
of
association.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
at
the
crossroads
and
i
have
tried
to
read
and
i
am
not
certainly
the
smartest
man
in
the
world
nor
the
most
brilliant
legal
author,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
just
plain
common
sense
at
least
to
me
that
conclusion
that
this
country
is
based
on
two
things
and
it
separates
us
from
other
nations
and
that
is
the
most
basic
thing
as
the
right
to
be
the
left
alone.
the
right
of
individual
freedom,
which
of
course,
incorporates
with
it
and
i
think
that
it
is
protected
by
the
bill
of
rights,
but
i
think
this
right
transcends
the
bill
of
rights.
i
think
it
is
a
god-given
right
to
be
left
alone
and
to
be
free
and
as
the
pierce
and
the
yoder
and
the
meyer
cases
indicated
with
reference
to
private
schools
and
the
right
of
an
education
there
is
certainly
no
constitutional
right
on
education.
this
court
has
held
that
once
a
state
steps
in
and
provides
in
the
education,
then
due
process
requires
that
all
people
be
treated
alike
independent
to
color
and
i
certainly
subscribe
to
that.
but
we
are
talking
about
public
schools,
when
we
get
into
the
area
of
private
schools
i
think
all
the
cases
that
i
have
read
from
this
court,
and
i
do
not
know
i
want
to
take
your
time
citing,
but
in
the
end
they
all
point
to
the
fact
that
private
schools
do
have
a
right
to
exist
regardless
of
their
discriminatory
policies,
and
i
think
they
have
got
that
right.
i
think
anymore
than
i
have
the
right
to
invite
whoever
i
want
to
in
my
home
and
the
argument
would
be,
well,
this
is
a
private
school
however,
it
does
require
a
certain
amount
of
touch
with
the
public,
is
that
not
sufficient
to
bring
it
within
any
ambit
of
the
meyer
case,
and
i
say
no.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well
because
i
think
as
the
dissent
pointed
out
in
this
case,
in
the
runyon
case
that
this
right
of
association
is
personal
situations
that
come
into
play
in
the
private
school,
and
i
think
parents,
if
the
parent
has
the
right,
as
this
court
said
in
the
pierce
case,
to
select
a
school
on
the
education
for
its
children,
then
i
say
that
this
is
a
concomitant
right
on
the
private
school
to
select
the
student
it
wants
to
educate,
and
i
feel
that
that
right
has
to
be
a
fundamentally
protected
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
of
contract,
if
the
jones
case
is
accepted
to
its
fullest
analysis,
then
it
gives
the
right
to
a
group
that
no
other
group
can
have
in
this
country.
it
gives
a
unilateral
right
to
force
a
contract
when
that
violates
and
emasculates
all
the
rules
of
contract
and
at
least
i
have
been
introduced
to
both
in
law
school
and
since
my
active
career
as
a
practitioner.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
contract
right
that
they
are
talking
about
at
1981
dealt
with
of
course
the
eliminating
the
shackles
of
slavery
and
should
have
been,
there
is
no
argument
on
that.
and
that
is
all
we
are
talking
about
because
the
blacks
did
not
have
a
right
to
contract
and
as
a
result
of
that
that
they
were
submitted
to
the
humiliation
that
those
folks
had
to
go
through,
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
they
certainly
are
not
talking
about
and
i
do
not
believe
they
intended
to
talk
about
the
fact
that
a
private
school
like
a
private
individual
is
mandate
to
accept
the
contract
by
somebody
they
do
not
want
to
accept
the
contract
with,
anymore
than
i
can
be
forced
to
accept
the
contract
or
anybody
else
because
contracts
require
mutuality.
if
we
are
going
to
get
into
the
(inaudible),
legalities
and
explanations
of
rights
and
duties
and
if
we
are
going
to
get
in
to
contractual
rights,
whether
it
would
be
wilson
or
anybody
else,
whatever
it
may
be,
i
have
never
seen
in
any
legislation,
any
contract
forced
upon
an
individual,
lacks
in
the
mutuality
of
the
minds
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
being
done
here.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
exactly.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well
now,
we
are
assuming
as
we
are
here
that
this
is
purely
private
school.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
my
answer
is
no,
and
if
it
is
and
this
area
goes
to
my
views
i
may
disagree
with
it.
i
say
they
have
got
that
right.
it
is
a
absolute
right
that
every
single
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
no,
i
say
no,
it
does
not
apply
with
that
because
in
citing
the
civil
rights
case
of
1883,
we
bring
them
forward.
the
constitution
cannot
reach
private
discrimination,
it
is
just
that
simple.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
maybe
in
the
pure
sense
it
would,
but
in
the
sense
of
a
right
and
a
duty
that
the
contract
would
bring
into
play
then
i
say
that
that
statute
cannot
do
that
because
it
cannot
force
a
person
to
undergo
a
contract
he
does
not
wish
to.
and
i
think
that
has
been
fundamental
in
all
our
cases.
there
is
actually
no
decision
that
i
have
seen
anywhere,
and
of
course
i
could
not
possibly,
that
says,
you
mr.
koutoulakos
must
be
mandated
to
accept
the
contract
whether
you
want
it
or
not.
that
is
exactly
what
the
interpretation
of
1981
would
have
to
do,
and
i
say,
no,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
offer
has
to
come
from
the
other
way.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
exactly,
exactly
correct
like
you
invite
a
guest
in
your
home
and
that
is
exactly
the
predicate
that
i
am
operating
your
honor.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
but
he
also
has
the
right
to
refuse
it.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
of
course,
depending
on
whether
he
have
any
federal
involvement
or
state
involvement,
absent
that
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
he
has
got
the
right
absent
what
the
criteria
have
been
as
set
out
in
prior
court
precedents,
he
has
that
right.
it
might
not
be
a
nice
right;
it
maybe
something
that
we
do
not
want
to
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
that
is
a
statute
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
that
is
right
and
i
say
it
does
not.
i
say
there
has
been
some
rather
interesting
decisions
even
flowing
from
that
decision.
and
i
certainly
do
not
want
to
presumptuous.
i
said
earlier,
i
disagree
with
it;
i
will
say
it
again
i
disagree,
but
anyone
can
be
distinguished
but
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
except
for
one
thing.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
statute
that
owes
its
existence
to
the
post
revolutionary
days,
and
a
hard
reading
of
a
both
the
debates
and
the
decision,
and
i
just
got
have
to
believe
that
this
court
was
just
as
conversant
with
the
debate
in
those
days,
back
in
1983
when
they
came
down
hard
with
that
decision
as
they
are
today.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
the
1883
civil
rights
decision.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
i
understand
that
but
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
that
literally
--
i
just
do
not
go
on
with
that
argument.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
if
that
is
a
decision.
i
do
not
go
along
with
the
decision.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well
yes,
but
you
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
right
but
you
are
talking
about
a
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
but
you
are
talking
about
the
voting
right
now.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
that
is
right.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
of
course
they
must
have
made
that
argument
with
tongue-in-cheek
that
deals
with
voting
right.
certainly
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you
on
that
view.
it
is
a
little
different
proposition
than
private
school.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
the
state
action
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
i
would
assume
so
but
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
i
would
hope
so
but
some
schools
do
not.
i
would
say
that
they
probably
did.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
are
you
talking
about
the
school
that
i
represent?
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well,
you
know
the
private
schools
in
virginia,
at
least
this
one
is
not
regulated
other
than
having
a
certificate,
and
that
is
the
only
type
of
thing
that
they
have
to
meet.
yes,
they
do
pay
taxes.
i
did
not
realize
you
were
referring
to
my
--
yes,
they
do
pay
taxes.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
for
health
reasons
or
fire
prevention
reasons
that
type
of
thing.
we
have
a
very
comprehensive
public
school
statutory
scheme
in
virginia.
it
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
world,
and
that
is
why
i
come
down
art
on
the
right
of
a
private
school
at
least
in
our
state
to
do
as
it
chooses
because
i
probably
thought
that
was
great.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
i
am
not
saying
that
the
state
law
does,
what
i
said
is
that
insofar
as
a
private
individual
is
concerned,
and
i
am
of
course
taking
the
position
of
private
school,
that
is
purely
private
school
as
it
has
the
same
rights,
and
that
is
a
right
that
is
the
personal
right,
that
is
a
god-given
right
for
you
to
live
with,
and
that
is
what
i
think
what
separates
the
democracy
from
other
nations.
that
right
to
choose
your
associates,
who
do
you
want
to
bring
in
your
home
and
to
do
as
you
see
fit
personally
as
long
as
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
it
is
a
home
in
the
sense
that
is
a
private
establishment
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
about
155
in
that
area.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
they
run
up
to
the
second
grade.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
and
second
grade,
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
boys
and
girls.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
about
155.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
in
that
–-
well,
yes
i
would
say
generally.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
both
half
day
and
all
day
and
they
do
have
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
and
it
is
a
very
fine
school,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
man
that
runs
it
used
to
be
and
his
wife
used
to
be
(inaudible).
they
are
both
fine
people
and
love
children
and
let
me
make
this
observation.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
since
the
late
50s.
they
never
had
an
opportunity
to
reject
or
admit,
because
no
black
person
had
ever
applied.
once
they
did
apply,
we
have
admitted
them
and
i
think
they
are
two
or
three
presently
in
the
school
now,
so
that
is
not
the
question.
the
question
that
we
come
down
hard
on
this
is
the
individual
right
of
a
private
citizen
just
like
a
private
school
to
insist
on
who
they
wish
or
do
not
wish
to
give
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
now
there
are,
yes,
because
since
the
decision
came
down,
they
did
apply.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
but
it
was
none
--
at
that
time
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
that
is
the
question,
yes,
that
is
at
least
before
this
court
and
we
take
the
position
that
is
private
school,
it
can.
it
got
a
freedom
of
choice.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
that
is
the
issue;
that
is
squarely
the
issue.
no
questions.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
no,
not
at
all.
no,
because
we
still
take
the
position
and
i
say
regardless
of
my
personal
views,
i
take
the
position
that
we
have
got
that
right
as
an
individual.
we
have
got
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
right
of
association,
and
i
remember
what
justice
brandeis
said
in
a
dissent.
and
he
said,
one
of
the
great
rights
we
have
in
this
country,
and
he
consist
that
the
highest
right
was
the
right
to
be
left
alone
without
getting
so
much
government
regulation,
governmental
interference
and
everything
and
when
that
falls
short
i
guess,
it
devolves
upon
the
courts,
when
they
see
abuses,
and
i
certainly
do
not
argue
that
too
much,
but
i
think
sometimes
we
have
extended
ourselves
in
the
areas
that
belong
to
the
legislature.
i
do
not
believe
we
can
legislate
or
rather
we
can
by
judicial
precedent
do
away
with
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
that
is
right,
but
the
interpretation
of
statute
if
–-
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
i
like
the
dissent
and
i
guess
it
seems
like
i
am
mostly
on
dissent
side
that
the
honorable
justice
white
and
justice
harlan
had,
and
i
think
that
pretty
well
covers
it,
just
like
there
is
a
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
1982.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
but
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
no,
we
are
talking
about
private
discrimination
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
well
1980
--
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
yes
it
does
but
i
am
saying
though
that
the
justices
went
into
the
history
of
private
and
non-private
discrimination
and
its
application.
now
that
set
out
the
dissent
was
brilliant.
i
like
it
very
much.
well,
in
any
event,
i
do
take
the
position
and
there
is
a
recent
case
that
the
cook
case
that
came
up
from
alabama,
the
federal
court
distinguishes
even
the
decision
of
jones
and
comes
down
very
hard
at
least
on
the
argument
that
i
am
trying
to
make.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
981
is
what
is
discussed
in
the
cook
case.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
1982.
mr.
louis
koutoulakos
that
is
all
it
is
and
it
is
exactly
right
that
1981
only
comes
in
by
illusion,
you
are
absolutely
correct
and
i
would
like
to
leave
it
with
that
and
leave
1981
exactly,
i
would
like
to
argue.
now
i
am
only
going
to
touch
briefly
on
the
fact
that
i
think
the
court
was
correct
in
the
statute
of
limitations
application
and
attorney’s
fees
i
think
absent
--
of
course
the
general
was
rather
clear,
in
this
country
any
how
absent
any
contractual,
any
contract
between
the
parties
or
any
statutory
amended,
the
attorney’s
fees
are
not
awarded.
and
in
this
case,
i
certainly
agree
with
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
is
certainly
no
bad
faith
and
as
the
dissent
again,
the
plaintiff,
i
am
repeating
myself,
indicated,
there
is
a
serious
question
in
their
mind,
and
it
was
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
the
case
was
proved
because
we
certainly
do
have
selective
admissibility
standards
that
logically
met
that
test,
it
just
was
overlooked
and
at
least
it
brought
the
issue
head
on
to
this
honorable
court
to
be
decided.
and
with
reference
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
think
that
is
rather
clear
state
law
applies
into
the
statute
was
the
applicable
one.
thank
you.
