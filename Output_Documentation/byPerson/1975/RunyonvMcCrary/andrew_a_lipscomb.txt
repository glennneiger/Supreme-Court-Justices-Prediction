mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
point
out
that
the
fairfax-brewster
school
that
i
represent
has
been
in
operation
to
more
than
20
years.
it
is
a
small
school
than
the
school
here
in
question
tha
had
177
pupils.
it
is
a
private
school
that
receives
no
public
funds
or
resistance
of
any
kind.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
boys
and
girls,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
from
pre-kindergarten
up
through
the
sixth
grade.
it
has
a
plan
or
purposes
of
exclusiveness
that
practice
selectivity
on
the
admission
of
pupils
on
the
basis
of
such
criteria
as
rareness,
previous
school
records,
age,
mental,
physical
and
emotional
maturity,
intelligence
and
achievement
potential.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
it
has
always
had
non-white
pupils,
many
orientals,
natives
of
asia,
india.
it
now,
as
a
result
of
the
position
below,
it
now,
on
my
advice,
has
been
accepting
all
negro
applicants
and
leaning
over
backwards
to
accept
them
even
when
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
whether
they
are
qualified.
it
has
rejected
--
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
your
honor,
it
is
a
problem
getting
back
into
court
again
on
this
and
we
do
not
want
to
get
back
in
the
court
again
on
it
and
we
believe
in
being
careful.
the
school
rejects
all
unqualified
applicants
including
whites.
in
its
enrolment
contract
it
reserves
the
right
to
accept
or
deny
the
application
of
any
child
for
any
reason
whatever.
it
does
not
advertise
in
newspapers,
magazines,
on
radio
or
television.
it
carries
an
advertisement
in
the
yellow
pages
of
the
telephone
book,
which
states
that
it
is
a
private
school.
most
of
the
parents
learn
about
the
school
from
other
parents.
in
may
1969,
the
gonzales
applied
for
admission
of
their
child
of
the
summer
camp.
their
main
purposed
being
to
get
the
child
on
the
camp,
getting
accustomed
to
the
environment,
so
that
he
could
continue
school
in
the
fall
on
the
first
grade.
and
it
was
the
negroes
ever
to
apply
in
the
school.
they
were
given
an
application
to
fill
out
and
returned
but
failed
to
provide
records
of
its
previous
educations
as
required.
and
the
only
previous
training
that
the
child
was
in,
the
day
nursery
school
which
did
not
provide
kindergarten
training
including
the
reading
and
numbers
writing,
which
was
required
by
fairfax-brewster
for
admission
to
its
first
grade.
the
child
was
rejected
while
a
letter
dated
may
16,
this
action
was
filed
three
years
and
seven
months
later.
mr.
gonzales
testified
that
when
he
got
the
rejection
notice
he
called
the
school,
he
talked
to
a
person
identified
as
captain
reece
(ph)
who
said
the
school
is
not
integrated.
captain
reece
denied
having
made
the
call,
having
had
the
conversation.
there
was
no
collaboration
of
that
call.
and
mrs.
bryant
(ph)
who
turned
out
to
be
a
neighbor
of
the
gonzales
and
also
of
the
mccrarys
who
are
plaintiffs
in
the
other
action
here,
testified
that
she
had
telephoned
the
school
in
january
of
1972
and
upon
inquiry
had
been
told
by
a
woman
or
man,
she
was
not
sure
that
she
could
not
remember
which,
that
the
school
did
not
admit
negro
children.
there
was
no
collaboration
of
that
conversation.
the
witnesses
for
the
school
denied
that
the
school
a
policy
of
not
accepting
negroes.
mrs.
gonzales
testified
that
at
all
times,
there
was
a
public
school
available
for
her
child.
about
a
week
after
rejection
by
fairfax-brewster
and
her
inquiry
at
bobbe’s
school,
the
child
was
immediately
accepted
to
another
private
school
in
the
area
where
he
stayed
for
two
years
and
it
went
to
a
private
parochial
school
for
two
years.
a
month
before
the
trial,
the
family
moved
out
of
the
county
and
the
child
was
attending
public
school
in
that
new
county
at
the
time
of
trial.
district
court
found
that,
as
a
fact
that
the
gonzales
child
had
been
rejected
because
of
his
race
stating
that
the
school
could
have
given
him
an
examination,
even
though
he
had
not
abide
that
the
educational
--
did
not
have
the
background
they
had
required.
it
also
found
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
school
not
to
accept
negroes.
there
was
no
finding
or
conclusion
or
even
any
implication
of
bad
faith,
perjury
or
untruthfulness
under
oath
as
to
any.
the
court
concluded
that
school
had
violates
section
1981,
it
avoid
compensatory
damages
on
behalf
of
the
child
and
attorney’s
fees
to
the
plaintiffs.
it
had
previously
ruled
that
the
claim
of
the
parents
was
barred
by
the
virginia’s
two-year
statute
of
limitations
which
is
expressly
made
applicable
to
every
action
for
personal
injuries.
it
also
ordered
a
permanent
injunction
enjoining
fairfax-brewster
from
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
color
in
its
admissions
policies.
we
contend
first
that
section
1981
does
not
prohibit
or
in
anyway
affect
the
right
of
private
schools
to
reject
applicants
because
of
race.
first
because
it
was
clearly
the
intent
of
the
39th
congress
when
they
enacted
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
from
which
section
1981
as
well
as
section
1982
is
derived,
that
the
act
should
be
construed,
that
the
act
should
not
be
construed,
it
seems
their
clearly
expressed
intent
during
the
legislative
debates
that
the
act
should
not
been
construed
to
require
white
children
and
black
children
to
attend
the
same
schools.
the
bill
was
introduced
in
the
house
by
congressman
wilson,
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee,
co-author
of
the
bill
and
its
floor
manager
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
members
of
39th
congress
did
not
mean
by
the
terms
civil
rights,
what
that
term
may
mean
today.
wilson
said
or
rather
asked,
what
do
these
terms
mean
in
speaking
of
civil
rights
and
immunities?
what
do
these
terms
mean?
do
they
mean
that
in
all
things
civil,
social,
political,
all
citizens
without
distinction
of
race
or
colors
shall
be
equal?
by
no
means
can
they
be
so
construed.
do
they
mean
that
all
citizens
shall
vote
in
the
sovereign
states?
no,
he
said.
then
he
went
on
to
say,
nor
do
they
mean
that
all
citizens
shall
sit
on
the
juries
or
that
children
shall
attend
the
same
schools.
these
are
not
civil
rights
or
immunities.
wilson
defines
civil
rights,
as
the
absolute
rights
of
individuals,
the
natural
rights
of
man,
the
right
of
personal
security,
the
right
of
personal
liberty
and
the
right
to
acquire
and
enjoy
property.
though
he
said
but
a
great
fundamental
right
which
ti
was
the
object
of
the
bill
to
protect.
and
he
said
--
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
perhaps
not,
if
they
did
--
i
do
not
think
those
cases
apply
to
schools
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
i
do
not
recall
--
i
do
not
believe
your
honor
that
they
apply
to
school.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
that
is
not
what
these
men
intended.
that
was
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
the
supreme
court
later
–-
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
your
honor,
i
am
talking
about
the
intent
of
congress.
they
could
have
been
wrong.
the
question
is
what
did
this
bill
mean?
what
was
their
intent?
they
intent
was
that
it
would
not
apply.
and
that
i
think
is
what
this
court
has
to
consider
in
construing
and
interpreting
this
law.
now,
he
said,
this
bill
merely
affirms
the
existing
law.
we
are
following
the
constitution.
we
are
reducing
to
statute
form,
the
spirit
of
the
constitution.
we
are
establishing
no
new
right,
declaring
no
new
principle.
it
is
not
the
object
to
this
bill
to
establish
new
right
but
to
protect
and
enforce
those
which
already
belong
to
every
citizen.
if
the
court
please,
it
understand
the
act
that
is
helpful
to
look
at
its
historical
context
and
the
mischief
was
intended
to
remedy.
the
thirteenth
amendment
abolishing
slavery
was
the
law
of
the
land.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
was
--
when
the
bill
was
introduced
in
the
39th
congress,
it
contained
a
clause
declaring
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
in
civil
rights
or
immunities
among
the
inhabitants
of
any
state
or
territory
of
united
states
on
account
of
race,
color
or
previous
conditions
slavery.
in
both
houses,
this
clause
create
consternation,
there
were
an
intense
objections
to
it,
and
they
were
tied
in,
the
objections
were
tied
often
to
the
problem
of
schools
and
whether
this
language
could
be
construed,
so
as
to
require
the
white
children
and
the
negro
children
to
attend
the
same
school.
in
fact,
the
objections
were
so
strong
that
eventually
congress
and
wilson
in
order
to
obtain
passage
of
this
bill
amended
the
bill
to
delete
that
clause.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
your
honor,
they
did
not
distinguish,
i
think
they
were
talking,
but
they
were
concerned
with
the
idea
that
the
objected
to
was
the
children
attending
the
same
school.
they
did
not
distinguish,
did
not
differentiate
between
public
and
private.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
that
may
be
true.
there
were
some
of
the
south
i
know,
and
i
say
that
they
did
not
distinguish
and
they
make
no
distinction.
now,
i
did
not
--
when
the
plaintiffs
below
filed
the
supplemental
brief
about
a
week
ago
and
it
squared
me
to
some
additional
research.
i
found
some
statements
made
by
senator
trumbull
in
the
42nd
congress,
second
session
in
connection
with
the
supplemental
civil
rights
then
introduced
by
senator
schuyler,
which
would
have
prohibited
racial
discrimination
in
all
common
schools
and
other
public
institutions
of
learning.
senator
trumbull’s
remarks
are
extremely
interesting
and
revealing.
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
open.
this
is
the
42nd
congress,
second
session
at
page
3189
he
said,
may
i
say
your
honors,
if
that
senator
trumbull
with
the
chairman
of
judicially
committee,
he
was
the
chief
sponsor
of
the
bill
on
the
senate
side;
he
was
the
co-author
of
the
bill.
at
page
3189
of
the
congressional
law
stated
that
the
right
to
go
to
school
is
not
a
civil
right
and
never
was,
it
is
a
privilege.
the
senator
may
try;
i
deny
his
right
as
a
member
of
congress
to
force
anybody
into
a
school
or
to
force
anybody
to
take
anybody
into
a
school.
at
page
3190
he
said,
why
so
we
passed
years
ago
a
civil
rights
bill
confirming
upon
the
colored
people
all
the
civil
rights
which
white
people
have
and
they
have
them
to
the
same
extent.
at
page
3191,
he
made
remarks
which
i
will
not
read
here
but
refer
the
court
to.
at
page
3426
he
said,
i
do
not
believe
in
legislation
forcing
member
of
the
same
school
or
undertaking
to
control
how
they
should
go
to
school
by
act
of
congress.
it
was
the
idea
mr.
justice
stewart
that
they
are
requiring
children
of
the
two
races
to
go
to
school
they
objected
to.
they
considered
schools
and
education
to
be
within
the
domain
of
the
states
and
not
a
civil
right
at
all.
so
therefore,
they
did
not
consider
that
going
to
school,
or
the
requirement
of
going
to
the
same
schools
was
comprehended
within
the
language
right
to
make
enforced
contracts
which
is
contained
in
section
1981
that
mr.
justice
stewart
questioned
my
koutoulakos
with.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
well
your
honor,
it
is
a
property
right.
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
attend
public
school
is
a
property
right
and
so
that
we
can
get
under
section
1982.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
your
honor,
when
the
congress
enacted
that
language
and
they
selected
that
language,
of
course,
they
were
trying
--
the
mischief
they
were
seeking
to
correct
or
is
the
reenactment,
in
effect,
the
reenactment
of
the
slave
codes
or
new
black
codes
which
simply
continued
the
disabilities
that
the
slaves
had
had
before
the
abolition
of
slavery.
the
disability
to
make
it
enter
into
contracts,
to
own
property,
to
acquire
it.
so
they
were
seeking
to
eliminate
those
disabilities
and
that
is
what
they
meant
when
they
said
to
make
enforced
contracts.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
i
do
not
think
they
would.
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
--
i
really
think
not.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
which
they
had
any
intention
would
be
comprehended
in
the
clause.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
conceivably
your
honor
and
i
would
not
quarrel
with
that,
but
i
wanted
to
move
if
i
might
to
the
thirteenth
amendment
very
briefly
and
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
virtually
identical
in
language,
are
really
quite
different
in
scope,
and
that
is
because
the
subject
matter
of
two
amendments
is
so
vastly
different.
the
fourteenth
amendment
contains
those
magnificent
generalities
and
great
ideas
and
concepts
like
equal
protection
of
the
law,
due
process,
the
thirteenth
amendment.
those
ideas
are
capable
of
growth
and
wealth.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
now
taking
the
thirteenth
amendment
your
honor,
it
is
a
(inaudible)
subject
matter.
it
cannot
grow.
it
abolished
slavery.
that
was
the
end
of
slavery;
110
years
ago
it
abolished
slavery.
that
was
the
end.
that
could
be
both
for
the
growth
or
development,
the
incidents
of
slavery
that
existed
then
cannot
be
added
to
or
enlarged
under
thirteenth
amendment
and
to
do
so
--
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
no,
i
mean
to
say
they
could
be
--
the
authority
of
congress
to
enact
appropriate
legislation
could
not
enlarge
the
incidents
and
add
to
them
to
those
that
existed
and
which
were
abolished
when
slavery
was
abolished.
that
is
what
i
meant.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
i
do
not
know
about
the
word
vestiges
your
honor.
the
vestiges
is
very
--
the
incidents
i
would
accept
your
honor,
but
vestiges
and
badges
are
very
loose,
very
modular
term.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
that
they
might
enforce
the
abolition
of
slavery
by
appropriate
legislation
and
not
go
beyond
slavery
itself
in
voluntary
service
and
necessary
incidents
that
were
understood
by
the
people
at
that
time
to
be
part
slavery.
discrimination
for
example
was
not
regarded
by
the
people
at
that
time
as
an
incident
of
slavery.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
yes,
your
honor,
they
did
mean
that.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
yes,
they
did
mean
that
your
honor.
i
think
therefore
that
so
construed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
is
quite
proper.
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
--
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
mr.
lipscomb
if
you
are
contemplating
reserving
any
time
for
rebuttal,
you
are
now
in
your
last
five
minutes.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
i
do
not
think
i
am
going
to
be
able
to
reserve
any
time.
mr.
andrew
a.
lipscomb
that
private
schools
and
public
schools
are
quite
different.
private
schools
have
not
yet
been
held
to
be
a
public
accommodation
along
with
inns,
common
carriers,
theaters
and
similar
places
of
amusement
and
restaurants.
no
reasonable
member
of
the
public
would
expect
that
he
could
demand
admission
into
a
private
school
and
force
his
way
in
simply
because
they
carried
an
advertisement
in
the

lawyers
are

in

they
may
have
their
cards
in
martindale-hubbell,
but
i
do
not
think
they
can
be
compelled
to
accept
clients
they
do
not
want
except
those
unusual
situations
where
they
are
appointed
to
represent
a
person
that
has
not
been
attorney

about
private
schools,
they
may
do
things
that
public
schools
may
not.
they
may
provide
the
religious
instruction.
they
may
propagate
a
sectarian
viewpoint
and
they
do
many
things
including
discipline
that
the
public
schools
are
inhibited
from
doing.
now,
not
like
private
clubs,
private
schools
are
different
form
or
mode
of
private
association
or
private
club.
the
relationships
are
personal
and
intimate.
the
management
provides
the
expertise,
the
professional
staff
and
the
facilities
in
which
the
children
associate
with
the
teachers
and
other
children
and
where
parents
also
get
into
the
act.
parents
who
place
their
children
in
private
schools
undergo
great
sacrifice
to
do
it.
thank
you.
