justice
potter
stewart
except
the
statute
says
that
all
persons
should
have
the
right
but
to
make
and
enforce
contracts?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
you
say
is
certainly
correct
as
i
remember
my
contract
from
law
school
except
that
if
a
school,
your
client,
says
we
will
never
ever
make
any
offered
to
anybody
at
the
negro
race.
so
nobody
in
the
negro
race
will
ever
have
an
opportunity
of
accepting.
is
that
not
depriving
everybody
in
the
negro
race
of
his
right
to
make
a
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
well
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
was
talking
about
the
application
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
was
trying
--
my
questioning
went
to
the
wording
of
the
statute.
i
have
a
right
to
make
a
contract
under
this
statute,
same
right
as
all
white
citizens
and
let
us
say
the
whole
world
said
disagree
that
i
would
never
during
my
whole
lifetime
have
an
offer
and
therefore
i
could
never
accept,
i
could
never
make
a
contract.
would
that
not
deprive
me
on
my
right
to
make
contracts?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
suppose
the
matter
of
contract
law,
and
your
client
would
make
the
offer
and
the
applicant
would
make
the
acceptance
or
is
it
the
other
way?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
a
statute;
that
is
on
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
statue
that
certainly
he
has
unless
there
is
state
action
or
state
involvement,
but
there
is
a
statute
covering
the
chief
justice’s
question,
title
vii,
and
there
is
a
statute
here,
and
the
question
is,
does
it
apply
this
to
situation?
that
is
the
only
question.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
koutoulakos,
could
you
tell
us
a
little
about
the
school,
how
many
students
are
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
grades?
justice
potter
stewart
just
kindergarten,
first
grade
and
second
grade?
justice
potter
stewart
boys
and
girls?
justice
potter
stewart
about
155?
justice
potter
stewart
all
drawn
from
the
immediate
area?
justice
potter
stewart
all
day
long
a
half
day?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
is
the
school
been
in
existence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
thought
it
was
the
question.
you
say
there
are
in
fact
negro
students?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
at
the
time
of
this
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is,
whether
the
school
can
practice
a
policy
and
complete
racial
exclusion.
that
was
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
point
is
that
the
legislature
acted
here
when
we
have
statute
to
construe,
that
is
the
only
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
different
statutory
provision;
that
was
section
1982.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
1981.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
different
language
and
maybe
a
different
history.
justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly
you
would
agree
that
it
has
different
language.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
think
you
would,
because
i
think
it
might
help
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
arose
under
section
1982.
this
is
quite
a
different
section,
worded
quite
differently.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
jones
against
mayer
was
19
–-
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
all
it
is
got
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
the
pupils
are
boys
and
girls?
justice
potter
stewart
in
what
classes
or
grades?
justice
potter
stewart
you
better
be
careful
with
that
advice.
justice
potter
stewart
you
better
be
a
little
careful
with
that
advice
and
otherwise
too.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
were
they
talking,
do
you
think,
about
public
schools
or
private
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
in
many
parts
of
the
country,
there
were
not
public
schools
in
those
days.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
statutory
entitlement
in
those
states
and
i
supposed
that
includes
now
all
the
50
states
where
there
is
an
absolute
statutory
right
to
go
to
a
public
school,
but
it
is
only
by
reason
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
confront
itself
to
restrictions
upon
the
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
could
be
retained
as
they
were
in
the
black
codes?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
congress
had
the
power
under
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
eliminate
the
vestiges
of
slavery?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
think
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment
did
mean
then?
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
about
the
ability
to
leave
a
capacity
to
own
property?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
make
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
leonard,
do
you
rely
on
your
argument
on
the
religion
either
of
the
two
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
am
not
sure.
i
wonder
if
you
could
just
answer
my
question
so
i
will
be
sure
i
follow
you
right.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
rely
in
your
argument
on
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
do
not?
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
i
think
it
does
because
of
this
religious
school
but
you
do
not
represent
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
asked.
that
is
what
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
different.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
that
is
no
part
of
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
mean
they
are
integrated
in
a
religious
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
are
segregated
religious
schools
and
not
integrated
religiously.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
leonard.
is
it
not
the
only
issue
in
this
case,
well
at
least
the
first
issue
in
this
case,
whether
this
federal
statute
–-
justice
potter
stewart
--
prohibits
the
policies
–-
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
your
schools
follow?
and
secondly,
if
it
does,
is
the
statute
constitutional
as
so
applied?
there
are
the
two
issues,
are
they
not?
and
the
only
two,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
question
of
philosophy
or
policy
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
construe
it
a
certain
way,
then
it
is
a
matter
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
applied,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
that
is
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
been
settled;
the
question
is
whether
it
was
well-settled?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
involved
1982.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
argued
last
week
--
but
in
any
event
it
is
your
--
as
i
understand
it
--
it
is
your
submission
and
your
understanding
that
you
are
parting
to
us
that
whoever
may
be
the
permissible
plaintiff
under
the
section
1981,
the
only
cause
of
action
that
can
be
stated
under
1981
is
one
of
racial
discrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
of
any
case,
anywhere
that
has
construed
section
1981
to
be
applicable
in
anything
except
to
racial
discrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
oh
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
not
been
limited
just
to
negroes?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it
has
been
held
to
applicable
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
people
of
spanish
ancestry.
justice
potter
stewart
as
congressman
ben
who
proposed
the
amendment
of
this
legislation
was
at
the
same
time
a
member
of
that
committee
that
was
actively
engaged
in
drafting
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
in
fact
between
1865
and
1870
public
schools
systems
in
all
of
the
states?
justice
potter
stewart
in
some
of
the
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
massachusetts
as
we
all
know
is
one
of
the
very
first
states
to
adapt
the
public
school
system
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
am
i
not
correct
in
understanding
that
not
all
of
the
states
had
public
school
systems
in
the
1860s,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
least
three
of
the
seven
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
they
were
far
from
convinced
that
the
district
court
was
right
and
its
finding
was
a
fact.
in
other
words,
if
they
were
far
from
convinced
that
your
opponents
were
correct
in
the
factual
assertion
of
the
defense
that
they
made.
now,
that
certainly
detracts
from
any
instance
of
bad
faith,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
alyeska
was
decided
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
how
long?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
petition
for
rehearing
of
any
kind
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
based
on
alyeska?
justice
potter
stewart
court
vindicated
far
from
being
withdrawn
prior
to
trial,
it
is
still
been
asserted
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
neither
is
1983,
well,
it
might
have
been
that
case
had
involved
personal
injuries.
the
cause
of
action
is
a
violation
of
federal
constitution
or
statutory
laws,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
physical
injuries
are
only
part
of
that
cause
of
action?
justice
potter
stewart
this
goes
just
to
the
damages
in
just
in
one
of
the
cases,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
just
one
of
the
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
these
cases
are
here
by
the
reason
of
the
grant
of
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
principal
issue
presented
by
these
consolidated
cases
is
whether
a
federal
law,
namely
section
1981
of
volume
42
of
the
united
states
code,
prohibits
commercially
operated
private
schools
from
excluding
qualified
children
solely
because
they
are
negroes.
that
law
in
pertinent
part
reads
as
follows.
“all
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
in
every
state
and
territory
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens.”
the
respondents
in
number
75-62,
michael
mccrary
and
colin
gonzales
are
negro
children.
by
their
parents,
they
filed
a
class
action
against
the
petitioners
in
that
case.
russell
and
katheryne
runyon,
who
are
the
proprietors
of
bobbe's
private
school
in
arlington,
virginia.
their
complaint
alleged
that
they
had
been
prevented
from
attending
the
school
because
of
the
petitioners'
policy
of
denying
admission
to
negroes,
in
violation
of
section
1981.
they
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
and
monetary
damages.
on
the
same
day,
colin
gonzales,
the
respondent
in
no.
75-66,
filed
a
similar
complaint
by
his
parents
against
the
petitioner
in
that
case,
fairfax-brewster
school
located
in
fairfax
county,
virginia.
the
petitioner
in
no.
75-278,
the
southern
independent
school
association,
sought
and
was
granted
permission
to
intervene
as
a
party
defendant
in
the
suit
against
the
runyons.
that
organization
is
a
nonprofit
association,
composed
of
six
state
private
school
associations,
and
represents
395
private
schools.
it
is
stipulated
that
many
of
these
schools
deny
admission
to
negroes.
the
suits
were
consolidated
for
trial.
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
which
were
left
undisturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
were
as
follows.
bobbe's
school
opened
in
1958
and
grew
from
an
initial
enrollment
of
five
students
to
200
students
in
1972.
a
day
camp
was
begun
in
1967
and
has
averaged
100
children
per
year.
the
fairfax-brewster
school
commenced
operations
in
1955
and
opened
a
summer
day
camp
in
1956.
a
total
of
223
students
were
enrolled
at
the
school
during
the
1972-1973
academic
year,
and
236
attended
the
day
camp
in
the
summer
of
1972.
neither
school
has
ever
accepted
a
negro
child
for
any
of
its
programs.
in
response
to
a
mailed
brochure
addressed
"resident"
and
an
advertisement
in
the
"yellow
pages"
of
the
telephone
directory,
mr.
and
mrs.
gonzales
telephoned
and
then
visited
the
fairfax-brewster
school
in
may
of
1969.
after
the
visit,
they
submitted
an
application
for
their
son
colin's
admission
to
the
day
camp.
the
school
responded
with
a
formal
letter,
which
stated
that
the
school
was
"unable
to
accommodate
colin's
application."
mr.
gonzales
telephoned
the
school.
fairfax-brewster's
chairman
of
the
board
explained
that
the
reason
for
colin's
rejection
was
that
the
school
was
not
integrated.
mr.
gonzales
then
telephoned
bobbe's
school,
from
which
the
family
had
also
received
in
the
mail
a
brochure
addressed
simply
to
“resident.”
in
response
to
a
question
concerning
that
school's
admissions
policies,
he
was
told
that
only
members
of
the
caucasian
race
were
accepted.
in
august
of
1972,
mrs.
mccrary
telephoned
bobbe's
school
in
response
to
an
advertisement
in
the
telephone
book.
she
inquired
about
nursery
school
facilities
for
her
son,
michael.
she
also
asked
if
the
school
was
integrated.
the
answer
was
no.
upon
these
facts,
the
district
court
found
that
the
fairfax-brewster
school
had
rejected
colin
gonzales'
application
on
account
of
his
race
and
that
bobbe's
school
had
denied
both
children
admission
on
racial
grounds.
the
court
held
that
section
1981
makes
illegal,
the
schools'
racially
discriminatory
admissions
policies.
it
therefore
enjoined
fairfax-brewster
school
and
bobbe's
school
and
the
member
schools
of
the
southern
independent
school
association
from
discriminating
against
applicants
for
admission
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
court
awarded
compensatory
relief
to
mr.
and
mrs.
mccrary,
michael
mccrary,
and
colin
gonzales,
but
the
court
held
that
the
damages
claim
of
mr.
and
mrs.
gonzales
was
barred
by
virginia's
two-year
statute
of
limitations
for
personal
injury
actions,
"borrowed"
for
section
1981
suits
filed
in
that
state.
finally,
the
court
assessed
attorneys'
fees
for
$1,000
against
each
of
the
two
schools.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
sitting
en
banc,
affirmed
the
district
court's
grant
of
equitable
and
compensatory
relief
and
its
ruling
as
to
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations,
but
reversed
its
award
of
attorneys'
fees.
we
granted
the
petitions
for
certiorari
filed
by
the
fairfax-brewster
school
and
that's
case
number
75-66;
bobbe's
school
in
number
75-62;
and
the
southern
independent
school
association
number
75-278,
to
consider
whether
section
1981
prevents
private
schools
of
this
kind
from
discriminating
racially
among
applicants.
we
also
granted
the
cross-petition
of
michael
mccrary,
colin
gonzales,
and
their
parents,
in
number
75-306
to
determine
the
attorneys'
fees
and
statute
of
limitations
issues.
it
is
perhaps
worth
noting
that
some
of
the
questions
that
these
cases
do
not
present.
they
do
not
present
any
question
of
the
right
of
a
private
social
organization
to
limit
its
membership
on
racial
grounds
or
any
other
grounds.
they
do
not
present
any
question
of
the
right
of
a
private
school
to
limit
its
student
body
to
boys,
to
girls,
or
to
adherence
of
a
particular
religious
faith.
they
do
not
even
present
the
application
of
section
1981
to
private
sectarian
schools
that
practice
racial
exclusion
on
religious
grounds.
rather,
these
cases
present
only
two
basic
questions.
whether
section
1981
prohibits
private,
commercially
operated,
nonsectarian
schools
from
denying
admission
to
prospective
students
solely
because
they
are
negroes,
and,
if
so,
whether
that
federal
law
is
constitutional
as
so
applied.
it
is
now
well
established
that
section
1981
enacted
under
the
power
conferred
upon
congress
by
section
2
of
the
thirteenth
amendment,
prohibits
racial
discrimination
in
the
making
and
enforcement
of
private
contracts
and
we
think
it
is
apparent
that
the
racial
exclusion
practiced
by
the
fairfax-brewster
school
and
bobbe's
private
school
amounts
to
a
classic
violation
of
section
1981.
the
parents
of
colin
gonzales
and
michael
mccrary
sought
to
enter
into
contractual
relationships
with
bobbe's
school
for
educational
services.
colin
gonzales'
parents
sought
to
enter
into
a
similar
relationship
with
the
fairfax-brewster
school.
under
these
contractual
relationships,
the
schools
would
have
received
payments
for
services
rendered,
and
the
prospective
students
would
have
received
instruction
in
return
for
those
payments.
the
educational
services
of
bobbe's
private
school
and
the
fairfax-brewster
school
were
advertised
and
offered
to
members
of
the
general
public,but
neither
school
offered
services
on
an
equal
basis
to
white
and
nonwhite
students.
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
"there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
trial
judge's
factual
determinations
that
colin
gonzales
and
michael
mccrary
were
denied
admission
to
the
schools
because
of
their
race.
"the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
section
1981
was
thereby
violated
follows,
we
think
inexorably,
from
the
language
of
that
statute,
as
construed
in
our
previous
cases.
the
question
remains
whether
section
1981
as
applied,
violates
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
free
association
and
privacy,
or
a
parent's
right
to
direct
the
education
of
his
children.
in
a
series
of
decisions,
the
court
has
recognized
a
first
amendment
right
to
engage
in
association
for
the
advancement
of
beliefs
and
ideas.
from
this
principle
it
may
be
assumed
that
parents
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
send
their
children
to
educational
institutions
that
promote
the
belief
that
racial
segregation
is
desirable,
and
that
the
children
have
an
equal
right
to
attend
such
institutions.
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
practice
of
excluding
racial
minorities
from
such
institutions
is
also
protected
by
the
same
principle
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
"there
is
no
showing
that
discontinuance
of
the
discriminatory
admission
practices
would
inhibit
in
any
way
the
teaching
in
these
schools
of
any
ideas
or
dogma.
"in
meyer
against
nebraska,
good
many
years
ago,
the
court
held
that
the
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
includes
the
right
to
send
one's
children
to
a
private
school
that
offers
specialized
training,
in
that
case,
instruction
in
the
german
language
and
that
doctrine
was
expanded
in
the
later
case
of
pierce
against
society
of
sisters
and
much
more
recent
case
of
wisconsin
against
yoder.
it
is
clear
that
the
present
application
of
section
1981
infringes
no
such
constitutional
right
as
was
recognized
in
those
cases.
no
challenge
is
made
to
the
petitioner's
right
to
operate
their
private
schools
or
the
right
of
parents
to
send
their
children
to
a
particular
private
school
rather
than
to
a
public
school
nor
do
these
cases
involve
a
challenge
to
the
subject
matter
which
is
taught
at
any
private
school.
thus,
the
fairfax-brewster
school
and
bobbe's
private
school
and
members
of
the
intervenor
association
remain
free
to
inculcate
whatever
values
and
standards
they
think
desirable.
the
court
has
held
that
in
some
situations
the
constitution
confers
a
right
of
privacy.
while
the
application
of
section
1981to
the
conduct
at
issue
here
does
not
represent
governmental
intrusion
into
the
privacy
of
the
home
or
a
similarly
intimate
setting,
it
does
implicate
parental
interests.
these
interests
are
related
to
in
a
cogent
kind
of
way
to
the
to
the
pro-creative
rights
protected
in
such
cases
as
roe
against
wade
and
griswold
against
connecticut.
but
the
court
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
while
parents
do
have
a
constitutional
right
to
send
their
children
to
private
schools
and
a
constitutional
right
to
select
private
schools
that
offer
specialized
instruction.
they
have
no
constitutional
right
to
provide
their
children
with
private
school
education
unfettered
by
reasonable
government
regulation.
for
these
and
other
reasons,
spelled
out
in
some
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
enforcement
of
section
1981
in
these
cases
will
not
work
a
deprivation
of
any
constitutional
right
of
the
defendant
schools,
of
the
intervenors
or
of
their
pupils
or
patrons.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
disposition
of
the
subsidiary
issues
involving
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
award
of
attorney
fees.
for
the
reasons
i
have
summarized
which
are
elaborated
at
considerable
length
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
all
respects
affirmed.
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens
while
joining
the
court's
opinion
have
each
filed
concurring
opinions.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
has
been
joined
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
