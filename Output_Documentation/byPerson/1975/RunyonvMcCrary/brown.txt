mr.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
be
presenting
the
argument
in
the
three
cases
in
which
the
plaintiffs
below
are
the
respondents,
those
are
number
75-62,
75-66
and
75-278.
my
co-counsel
mr.
boggs
will
present
argument
in
the
case
in
which
the
plaintiffs
below
are
the
petitioners,
that
is
number
75-306,
the
case
--
the
evasions
are
about
a
proceeding
pertaining
to
the
matter
of
attorney’s
fees
and
the
applicable
statute
limitations
in
this
case.
in
my
argument
concerning
the
question
of
whether
private
schools
may
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
the
matter
really
resolves
itself
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
just
indicated
to
two
essential
problems.
one,
whether
42
u.s.c.
1981
applies
as
a
matter
statutory
construction
to
the
kinds
of
contracts
that
are
at
issue
in
this
proceeding;
and
secondly,
whether
as
if
it
does
apply,
it
is
a
constitutional
application
of
the
statute
or
in
other
words,
is
there
some
kind
of
proscription
in
the
first
amendment
which
restricts
the
applications
in
this
instance.
with
respect
to
the
first
issue
of
the
statute,
this
court
has
indicated
previously
of
course
that
the
two
provisions
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act
should
be
read
in
a
literal
way.
that
was
a
plain
holding
in
jones
v.
mayer
and
it
is
been
holding
in
the
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
and
tillman
versus
wheaton-haven
recreation
association
and
indeed
it
is
the
essence
of
the
holding
and
johnson
versus
railway
express
agency.
those
are
the
four
cases
in
which
the
court
has
previously
passed
on
the
1866
civil
rights
act.
the
claim
words
of
course
of
section
1981
are
easy
to
understand.
they
are
simply
that
all
persons
shall
have
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
as
white
citizens.
the
term
making
enforce
contracts
is
the
key
expression.
it
has
been
suggested
earlier
that
this
should
not
be
in
expansive
term
or
term
that
has
an
expanded
meaning
as
perhaps
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
construed,
it
does
not
need
to
have
an
expanding
meeting.
it
is
clear
what
it
said;
it
refers
to
contracts
of
all
kinds
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
a
contract
of
a
type
that
might
have
been
foreseen
or
contemplated
by
the
congress
in
1866
or
not.
now
there
obviously
are
some
limitations
when
you
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
first
amendment
might
limit
it,
but
for
the
moment
we
are
talking
about
the
literal
application
of
section
1981.
mr.
brown
the
different
language
in
1982
--
the
language
which
exists
in
1981
was
added
in
1870
your
honor
as
a
result
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1870
which
designed
to
encompass
within
the
protection
of
1981
non-citizens
or
aliens.
mr.
brown
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
brown
i
am
not
certain
about
that
your
honor
but
that
i
think
it
is
you
are
referring
to
with
respect
of
different
introductory
line
--
mr.
brown
well,
your
honor,
if
you
are
suggesting
that
--
if
i
understand
you,
you
are
suggesting
that
1981
requires
state
action
--
mr.
brown
well,
one
yard
of
a
clean
slate
because
there
are
several
decisions
which
we
are
building
on;
and
secondly,
this
court
has
examined
that
legislative
history.
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
writing
the
decision
in
tillman
versus
wheaton-haven
referred
for
example
to
the
fact
that
in
the
1870
act,
congress
reenacted
the
section
which
is
now
in
section
1981
in
verbatim
and
it
also
in
another
section
said
we
are
hereby
adapting
and
reenacting
all
of
the
1866
act.
now,
it
is
been
--
mr.
brown
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
so
there
has
been
an
argument
as
to
whether
the
codifiers
of
revised
statutes
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
failing
to
make
that
back
reference
to
the
1866
statute.
mr.
brown
i
am
not
sure
if
i
can
answer
that
your
honor.
i
am
not
certain
--
mr.
brown
the
1981
was
reenacted
in
section
16
of
the
1870
act
in
a
verbatim
form
and
then
the
section
18
--
mr.
brown
well,
with
slight
modifications
because
--
mr.
brown
oh
yes!
in
section
18,
yes.
mr.
brown
i
am
not
sure
if
i
can
answer
that
your
honor.
i
am
not
certain.
mr.
brown
well,
i
think
the
rule;
the
general
construction
to
this
approach
that
this
court
has
taken
is
that
you
look
behind
the
revised
statutes
to
do
the
original
enactment.
mr.
brown
well,
i
cannot
respond
to
this
your
honor,
i
am
not
certain
to
this.
i
did
not
anticipate
this
line
of
questioning
because
i
thought
the
issue
had
been
well
settled
by
the
opinions
in
the
tillman
and
johnson
versus
railway
express
case.
mr.
brown
oh![laughter]
mr.
brown
yes
your
honor,
i
realize
that.
well,
if
i
might
proceed
the
--
as
far
as
the
application
of
section
1981
as
we
say
we
think
that
to
the
contracts
that
are
involved
here,
we
do
think
that
the
matter
has
been
settled
by
jones
and
tillman
and
johnson
cases
and
we
think
that
it
would
be
a
surprising
development
indeed
if
it
were
not
well-settled
that
the
statute
does
apply
here.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
by
the
schools
here
in
their
arguments
before
the
court
that
this
involves
a
coercion
making
of
a
contract.
it
is
a
matter
of
prohibiting
the
person
who
offers
to
make
the
contract
from
conditioning
on
the
ground
of
race.
this
court
however
in
upholding
the
1964
is
civil
rights
act,
for
example,
made
it
very
clear
that
a
person
has
no
constitutional
right
to
discriminate
when
congress
has
said
that
patrons
of
a
business
establishment
or
another
type
of
establishment
may
not
be
selected
on
the
basis
of
race
that
this
is
not
depriving
individual
of
any
constitutional
rights,
rights
of
due
process
or
property
or
liberty.
there
is
no
deprivation
of
fifth
amendment
rights
by
congress
enacting
this
type
of
statute.
the
argument
has
also
been
made
here
in
the
brief
by
fairfax-brewster
school
and
it
has
been
repeated
again
today
that
in
enacting
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
congress
did
not
intend
or
that
there
is
legislative
history
which
would
indicate
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
act
to
cover
private
schools.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
erroneous
reading
of
the
legislative
history.
we
have
discuss
this
in
a
--
this
orange
reply
brief
that
we
filed
in
the
case
where
this
issues
had
been
raised,
and
we
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
a
clause
that
had
been
included
in
the
original
bill
which
prohibited
that
said
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
in
civil
rights.
some
of
the
persons
or
principally
congressman
ben,
for
example,
of
ohio,
who
objected
to
this
language
and
there
were
many
others
who
argued
that
this
would
have
the
effect
of
interfering
with
various
state
segregation
laws,
that
the
state
imposed
segregation
of
schools,
juries
etcetera,
that
they
had
at
that
time.
he
and
others
felt
that
--
that
is
congressman
ben
and
others
felt
that
the
matter
of
discriminatory
state
action
should
be
dealt
with
in
another
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
indeed
at
that
time,
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
then
being
drafted.
and
so
consequently,
when
this
language
that
is
been
referred
to
by
the
counsel
for
fairfax-brewster
was
the
statements
that
were
being
made
by
congressman
wilson
where
he
said
we
do
not
intend
this
amendment
to
apply
to
schools.
they
were
really
saying
they
did
not
think
the
proponents
of
the
1866
act
did
not
--
they
were
trying
to
save
it
from
these
attacks,
and
we
are
trying
to
say
we
do
not
intend
this
act
to
nullify
state
discrimination
laws.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
they
had
any
reference,
any
intention
to
have
their
language
refer
to
private
schools.
they
were
trying
to
say
that,
as
i
say,
ultimately
they
agreed
in
the
amendment
that
congressman
ben
was
proposed
which
then
eliminated
this
no
discrimination
in
civil
rights
clause.
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
added
by
the
1866
act
enacted
in
its
present
form,
and
there
has
been
no
--
there
is
really
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
of
history
as
to
exactly
what
kind
of
contracts
congress
really
had
in
mind.
it
is
a
very
generalized
language,
the
legislative
history
itself,
it
takes
up
many
pages
of
the
congressional
globe
of
that
era,
but
it
released
very
little
evidence,
it
provided
very
little
evidence
of
exactly
what
congress
was
talking
about.
however,
this
court
has
held
and
other
courts
have
held
that
this
phrase,
“giving
blacks
the
same
right
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
as
white
citizens”,
that
this
language
is
broad
enough
to
cover
employment
contracts
that
it
will
cover
contracts
concerning
the
admission
to
amusement
parks
or
admission
tickets
to
amusement
parks.
another
case
has
held
that
it
covers
the
guest
privileges
to
private
swimming
club.
i
am
referring
now
to
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
been
held
and
this
is
significant
here
that
this
statutory
term
covers
a
privately
owned
barber
trade
school.
it
was
held
to
cover
a
privately
owned
law
school,
the
purchase
of
insurance
policy,
the
admissions
to
--
mr.
brown
well,
1981
has
been
applied
to
cover
--
mr.
brown
if
you
just
said
spanish-speaking,
i
would
not
think
that
1981
proscribed
it.
now,
where
spanish-speaking
takes
on
a
racial
--
it
is
made
and
used
in
a
racial
context,
it
has
been
held
to
apply
and
indeed
there
was
a
case
precisely
like
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
involving
in
a
tavern
in
oregon
that
prohibited
spanish
from
being
spoken
there.
this
was
used
as
a
basis
for
primarily,
the
owner
argued,
for
memorizing
the
chances
of
racial
antagonisms
between
mexican-american
and
caucasian-americans.
and
when
the
spanish-speaking
--
there
was
spanish
spoken
by
mexican-americans,
the
court
held
this
constituted
racial
discrimination
when
they
were
excluded
from
the
tavern
as
a
result.
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is,
in
answer
to
your
question,
that
when
1981
only
applies
to
racial
discrimination
in
its
present
form;
that
is
all.
it
does
not
cover
any
other
kind
of
discrimination.
mr.
brown
well,
it
is
seems
to
me
that
it
will
be
arguable
but
then
it
became
within
the
proscription
of
1981.
mr.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
brown
no
sir,
not
on
the
question
we
are
talking
about
here,
the
question
of
construction
of
this
statute.
the
statute
was
enacted
pursuant
to
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
aside
from
this
question
that
your
honors
heard,
argued
last
week
in
the
mcdonald
case
that
involved
the
question
whether
whites
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1981.
this
does
not
proscribe
anything
but
racial
discrimination
so
as
far
as
any
of
the
cases
indicate
or
the
legislative
history
would
indicate.
mr.
brown
i
do
not
know
that.
i
cannot
give
you
that
answer
your
honor,
that
was
being
mcdonald
case.
mr.
brown
yes
sir,
no
question
about
that
in
my
view.
mr.
brown
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
do
not
believe
that
case
has
been
litigated.
it
certainly
the
issue
has
been
presented
here
whether
somebody
would
bring
a
case
proposing
such
a
theory,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
brown
no,
i
do
not
know
of
any
case.
it
was
a
question
at
one
time
as
to
whether
it
covered
aliens,
i
believe,
mexican-americans,
but
i
think
that
was
resolved.
i
think
some
case
has
been
brought
asserting
the
right
of
women
but
i
do
not
think
it
has
been
successful
that
is
asserting
that
women
have
a
cause
of
action
for
sex
discrimination,
but
i
do
know
--
i
cannot
tell
you
what
happened
to
it.
mr.
brown
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
brown
1981?
mr.
brown
blacks
and
–-
mr.
brown
yes.
yes,
i
am
pretty
certain
that
is.
mr.
brown
well,
yes.
mr.
brown
well,
it
comes
from
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
i
suppose
--
mr.
brown
well,
it
sounds
like
i
am
being
asked
the
kind
of
questions
that
are
involving
mcdonald
case
but
i
cannot
--
mr.
brown
i
think
--
mr.
brown
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
brown
not
according
to
my
understanding
of
johnson,
and
i
am
stating.
if
i
might
go
on
your
honors
to
the
what
i
think
is
really
the
crucial
question
in
this
case
--
mr.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
brown
your
honor,
the
fact
was
that
in
a
historical
context
it
happened
concurrently
because
at
the
same
time,
the
1866
act
was
in
congress.
i
think
the
code
of
the
committee
of
reconstruction,
a
joint
committee
of
congress
was
actively
engaged
in
drafting
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
i
think
it
is
my
view
from
reading
the
legislative
history
and
i
have
read
a
fair
amount
of
it
that
they
were
really
sort
of
compartmentalizing
what
they
were
doing
that
they
intended
to
reach
private
discrimination
with
the
thirteenth
amendment
or
with
the
1866
act,
and
that
they
intended
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
cover
state
discrimination
or
state
action.
mr.
brown
he
was
the
principal
voice
on
it;
he
was
the
principal
voice
on
it.
just
one
more
thing
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
on
the
question
of
trying
to
discern
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
schools.
if
you
read
brown
versus
board
of
education,
again
the
court
kind
of
threw
up
its
hand
at
that
point,
after
having
been
deluged
with
extensive
briefs
on
this
whole
question.
what
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
fourteenth
amendment?
in
fact,
the
court
issued
these
special
questions
to
the
litigants
and
saying
what
did
congress
intend
that
it
intended
to
cover
schools?
and
the
court
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
intent
of
congress
of
that
period,
very
difficult
to
discern
if
not
impossible.
therefore,
we
have
to
resort
to
contemporary
landmarks
at
this
time
in
trying
to
find
out
whether
we
think
it
is
permissible
or
not,
that
it
is
state
imposed
discrimination
in
schools.
but
my
only
point
is
that
this
court
in
a
sense
has
already
held
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
discern
these
of
the
schools
in
that
period.
mr.
brown
yes.
i
think
that
is
the
way
you
have
to
read
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
brown
i
do
not
know
whether
they
were
all
in
on
all
the
state
your
honor.
there
was
public
school
system,
of
course.
mr.
brown
yes,
and
they
were
mostly,
i
guess
in
most
instances
operated
on
a
segregated
basis,
and
this
was
what
some
of
the
conservatives
in
the
congress
at
that
time
were
objecting
to
about
this
language
in
the
1866
act
which
--
mr.
brown
no,
i
do
not
really
know.
i
mean,
i
have
not
seen
any
clear
evidence
or
survey
at
this
whole
case.
mr.
brown
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
brown
yes
sir.
now,
the
next
facet
of
the
constitutional
argument
is
the
one
i
eluded
to
earlier
which
is
i
think
what
is
really
involved
here.
there
have
been
references
made
by
opposing
counsel
to
right
of
association
and
the
freedom
of
persons
to
express
their
beliefs
and
right
to
privacy
and
so
forth,
which
i
do
not
think
quite
hit
the
real
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proper
term
was,
an
appropriate
term,
let
us
say,
an
aped
term
was
used
by
professor
louis
henkin,
and
we
do
not
refer
to
this
in
our
brief
but
there
is
an
interesting
article
by
professor
louis
henkin
at
74
columbia
law
review,
at
page
1410
in
which
he
refers
to
autonomy
as
being
an
accurate,
perhaps
description
of
what
this
court
has
talked
about
in
some
of
its
privacy
cases
that
what
we
really
are
talking
about
here
perhaps
is
the
matter
of
familiar
autonomy.
i
am
saying
this
because
i
wanted
to
make
clear,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
frame
of
reference
for
the
court
in
its
analysis
of
the
issue.
the
cases
from
which
the
right
of
privacy
flows
which
have
been
the
basis
for
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
as
it
has
been
explicated
by
the
court
of
course
are
griswold
versus
connecticut,
eisenstadt
v.
baird,
stanley
versus
georgia,
and
roe
v.
wade.
those
are
the
basically
the
privacy
cases,
they
deal
with
such
matters
as
marriage,
procreation,
contraception
what
are
essentially
family
relationships,
but
they
are
not
all
really
privacy,
they
do
not
involve
a
necessarily
an
invasion
of
privacy
so
much
as
they
involve
the
state’s
interference
with
the
ability
to
act
freely,
and
according
to
one’s
own
personal
dictates.
now,
added
to
that
line
of
cases
are
the
other
two
cases
which
the
court
has
frequently
referred
to
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters
and
meyer
versus
nebraska.
pierce
versus
society
of
sisters
of
course
was
a
situation
where
the
state
had
said
that
in
effect
private
schools
could
not
exist;
all
persons
had
to
send
their
children
to
public
schools.
and
meyer
versus
nebraska
of
course
was
an
attempt
to
restrict
the
teaching
of
foreign
languages
in
private
schools.
and
those
cases
are
the
essence
sort
of
basis
i
should
say
of
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
right
to
liberty
of
the
persons
to
direct
the
education
in
upbringing
of
their
own
children.
now,
we
do
not,
in
any
way,
dispute
this
that
this
right
exists,
we
could
not.
however
in
the
case
of
the
norwood
versus
harrison
mr.
chief
justice
burger
writing
the
opinion
referred
to
the
pierce
case
for
example
and
at
page
461
of
the
court’s
opinion
in
norwood.
the
opinion
says,
as
mr.
justice
white
observed
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
yoder,
pierce
held
simply
that
while
a
state
may
posit
educational
standards,
it
may
not
preempt
the
educational
process
by
requiring
children
to
attend
public
schools.
and
that
is
exactly
the
point
in
pierce
and
in
meyer
versus
nebraska
the
court
said
very
clearly
that
the
state
through
its
police
powers
has
a
right
to
posit
educational
standards
and
other
kinds
of
regulations
that
are
necessary
to
control
the
manner
in
which
schools
are
operated.
now
parents
do
not
have
complete
autonomy
in
how
they
raise
their
children.
this
is
and
its
well
ingrained
at
our
legal
system
today.
compulsory
school
laws
have
been
upheld
everywhere
that
they
have
been
challenged.
parents
have
objected
to
compulsory
school
laws
on
religious
and
constitutional
grounds,
but
they
have
never
been
successfully
challenged
that
is
such
laws.
mr.
brown
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
the
other
case
which
is
an
important
one
to
bear
in
mind
is
prince
versus
massachusetts
where
a
person
used
a
child
for
the
purpose
of
selling
religious
tracks
and
the
state
of
massachusetts
prosecuted
the
parent
on
the
ground
that
it
is
the
violation
of
the
state
child
labor
law
and
this
court
held
that
notwithstanding
the
very
sacred
right,
if
you
will,
of
the
parent
to
control
the
child’s
activity
and
to
particularly
there
where
the
child
was
being
used
in
a
religious
way
or
as
an
expression
of
religious
belief
that
notwithstanding
the
importance
in
the
high
priority
given
these
rights,
the
state
still
had
a
legitimate
interest
and
the
right
to
control
a
child’s
upbringing
and
interfere
--
i
do
not
mean
totally
upbringing
but
to
require
the
parent
to
abide
by
the
child
labor
laws.
the
court
said
that
the
state
had
has
a
wide
range
of
power
for
limiting
parental
freedom
and
authority
and
things
affecting
the
child’s
welfare
and
this
includes
to
some
extents,
matters
of
conscience
and
religious
conviction.
so
we
submit
that
notwithstanding
the
expressions
of
conscience,
the
expressions
of
that
we
have
heard
here
about
beliefs
and
segregated
education
is
the
superiority
form
of
education
that
the
state
here
may
legitimately
in
a
constitutional
sense
tell
parents
that
if
you
are
going
to
send
your
child
to
school
and
you
will
require
to
by
the
compulsory
education
laws,
they
have
to
go
to
schools
under
the
conditions
that
we,
state
have
found
to
be
most
appropriate
in
a
democratic
society.
i
would
just,
in
closing,
would
like
to
add
one
word
and
that
is
that
--
i
think
it
is
very
significant
that
we
have
in
this
case
the
support
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
and
also
the
counsel
for
american
private
education,
the
national
association
of
independent
schools
and
the
southern
association
of
independent
schools.
this
comprises
the
majority
of
the
educational
industry,
if
you
will
in
the
united
states
and
they
have
a
saying
to
this
court
that
they
do
not
believe
that
the
court’s
affirmance
of
the
courts
below
would
interfere
with
the
way
they
operate
the
schools
whether
they
will
interfere,
it
will
interfere
with
the
right
of
parents
who
send
their
children
to
those
schools
to
control
the
education
of
their
children
unduly.
thank
you.
