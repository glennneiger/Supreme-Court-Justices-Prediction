justice
thurgood
marshall
you
also
disagree
with
smith
against
allwright,
do
you
not?
the
exact
same
argument
was
made
that
the
primary
in
texas
was
right
because
the
white
people
wanted
it
white
and
they
had
the
right
to
do
it.
nobody
could
do
anything
to
do
about
their
right
to
associate
with
whom
they
want
to
associate.
this
court
just
ignored
that
argument
completely.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
decision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
talking
about
smith
against
allwright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
smith
against
allwright
says
he
do
not
have
that
unlimited
right
to
associate
with
only
whom
he
wants
to
associate
with.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
you
do
not
go
along
with
the
decision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
decision
is
saying
you
could
not
ban
negroes
from
voting
in
the
primary
in
texas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
clearly.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
civil
rights
cases
said
to
the
contrary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
right
that
they
said
it
was
a
right
to
assemble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
right
to
be
together.
it
was
just
like
a
country
club.
i
can
remember
the
(inaudible)
yesterday.
it
was
just
a
perfect
little
private
manner,
you
could
do
whatever
you
please,
and
this
caught
just
right
up
to
end.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
there
is
no
state
action
in
it
at
all?
it
is
completely
financed.
i
guess
the
buildings
are
all
completely
financed
by
private
people
and
i
assume
they
pay
taxes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
they
pay
taxes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
school
pays
property
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
meet
the
requirements
of
the
virginia
educational
laws?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
have
a
certificate
and
they
are
not
periodically
examined
by
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
law
does
not
give
the
right
to
refuse
negroes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
no
home.
a
school
is
not
a
home?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
a
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
both
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah
i
have
seen
the
presents.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
then
they
caught
nearest
to
that
to,
the
supreme
court
in
100
in
ex
parte
virginia,
strauder
versus
virginia
and
virginia
against
rives
did
not
understand
that
at
all,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
closer
than
you
were?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
juries,
that
is
what
you
said.
it
did
not
apply
to
juries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
the
supreme
court,
in
that
time,
did
not
quite
understand
well?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
they
said
they
did
have
a
right
to
juries?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
private
“all
black”
school
that
excludes
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
negro
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
does
not
--
it
excludes
white
students?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
any
applied
or
not?
i
asked
you
one
that
excluded.
that
is
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
wrong,
as
of
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
as
of
today,
you
are
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
church
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
church
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
talking
about?
it
is
a
religious
school.
can
you
give
me
any
private
negroes
academy
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
non-religious,
private
school
that
excludes
anybody
on
the
grounds
of
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
imagine
a
white
student
applying
to
an
all-negro
school
in
mississippi?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i
am
objecting
to
you
sir
is
comparing
your
school
with
the
average
negro
private
school;
there
is
no
comparison?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
first
case
against
segregated
school
was
in
boston,
massachusetts
in
1850s,
roberts
against
the
city
of
boston?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
segregate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
really
do
not
know
the
answer
of
that
your
honor.
if
i
might
proceed
to
as
i
said
what
seems
to
me
the
second
crucial
question
in
the
case
namely,
whether
there
is
any
white,
a
reason
for
exempting
privately-owned
schools,
non-public
schools
from
the
thrust
of
section
1981?
it
seems
to
me
this
breaks
down
into
two
facets.
the
first
--
in
a
two
identifiable
points
here.
the
first
one,
it
seems
to
me,
concerns
the
matter
of
whether
there
is
an
institutional
privacy
that
these
schools
can
assert?
and
then
secondly,
whether
there
is
a
right
of
privacy,
a
personal
privacy
that
the
parents
can
assert
on
the
behalf
of
their
children
or
on
behalf
of
their
--
that
is
an
expression
of
their
right
to
raise
and
control
the
education
of
their
children
the
way
they
wish
too.
with
respect
to
the
institutional
privacy
and
the
reason
i
break
it
down
is
because
in
the
sense
of
courts
they
come
out
--
it
seems
to
me
they
come
from
two
different
frames
of
the
law,
of
course
two
different
lines
of
decisions,
on
the
question
to
the
institutional
privacy
and
whether
the
schools
are
in
fact
selective
and
are,
therefore,
in
position
to
ascertain
this
privacy
and
a
right
of
exclusion.
i
would
point
out
first
of
all
as
the
record
shows
that
the
schools,
both
of
these
schools
advertised
in
the
yellow
pages,
the
phone
book,
that
goes
to
defendant’s
schools.
they
have
open
enrolments,
they
solicit
patrons,
and
enrolments
in
the
community
where
they
are
located,
and
i
would
say
in
additions,
the
record
does
not
show
anything
to
the
contrary
so
far
as
these
schools
that
are
represented
by
the
southern
independent
schools
association.
indeed
it
is
well-known
that
the
reason
these
schools
exist
and
are
able
to
continue
in
existence
is
because
they
track
and
solicit
or
their
enrolments
are
open,
i
should
say,
to
everyone
in
communities
where
there
was
court
ordered
desegregation
of
schools
and
that
they
have
become
and
they
have
perpetuated
because
they
have
a
constant
in-flow
of
white
students.
so
as
far
as
we
know
they
are
open
to
all
white
persons
in
the
community.
the
court
in
the
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
and
in
tillman
versus
wheaton-haven
recreation
association
says
it
had
a
much
more
difficult
question
before
it,
it
seems
to
me
in
this
regard,
because
there
you
were
concerned
with
neighborhood
swimming
pools,
recreation
associations
which
really
conform
much
more
closely
to
the
conventional
concept
of
what
is
a
private
institution.
but
the
court
held
in
sullivan
case
and
it
held
in
the
tillman
case
that
those
two
associations
were
not
“truly
private”
because
they
had
no
plan
or
purpose
of
exclusiveness.
they
were
open
to
every
white
person
in
the
areas
they
served.
they
would
be
no
selective
element
other
than
race.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
language
really
covers
the
schools.
they
have
no
plan
or
purpose
of
exclusiveness
any
of
these
schools,
then
they
are
open
to
everyone
in
the
communities
or
the
areas
that
they
serve
and
race
is
the
only
factor
that
constitutes
an
absolute
bar.
now
of
course
they
do
have
other
selective
characteristics
but
then
so
did
the
swimming
pools
in
the
sullivan
and
tillman
cases.
the
memberships
in
those
schools,
those
associations
were
subject
to
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
and
they
had
various
other
kinds
of
geographic
and
financial
qualifications,
but
race
became
the
absolute
bar.
now,
again
with
respect
to
schools,
government
regulations
of
schools
is
a
very
common
thing,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
mentioned
earlier
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
there
are
state
regulations
that
have
been
in
existence
for
years
that
govern
such
matters
as
curriculum
teacher
qualifications
and
various
others
in
academic
standards,
and
so
forth.
now
the
other
very
important
and
very
significant
thing
is
that
in
1972
congress,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
congress
amended
title
vii
of
the
fair
employment
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
the
1964
to
apply
them
to
private
schools.
there
had
originally
been
exemption
for
educational
institutions
in
title
vii.
the
congress
repealed
that
in
1972
and
made
title
vii
applicable
to
private
schools.
now
it
would
certainly
be
in
congress,
in
the
extreme
for
the
court
to
say
that
these
schools
could
apply
racial
criteria
in
their
selection
of
students,
but
the
congress
at
the
same
time
said
that
they
may
not
use
race
as
a
criteria
in
selecting
faculty.
if
any
school
has
15
or
more
employees,
they
are
subject
to
title
vii
of
civil
rights
act.
that
is
an
important
to
consideration
to
be
borne
in
mind
and
in
considering
the
issue
here,
it
seems
to
me.
i
would
also
point
out
that
and
this
we
have
in
our
brief,
there
are
16
states
that
have
non-discrimination
education
laws.
16
states
that
have
adapted
laws
which
prohibit
discrimination
in
admissions
policies.
many
of
these,
a
number
of
these
are
modeled,
are
fashioned
after
a
model
law
that
has
been
promulgated
by
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws.
so
obviously
it
would
be
a
surprise
to
the
persons
who
drafted
those
laws
and
legislatures
that
have
been
enacted
them
for
the
court
to
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
somehow
prohibit
schools
from
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race.t
hat
would
of
course
be
--
that,
of
course,
would
be
the
effect
of
a
holding
against
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
now,
so
it
seems
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
be
interested
in
your
bad
faith
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
had
difficulty
in
finding
a
bad
faith
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
is
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
about
the
bad
faith
of
the
parties?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
basically
there
was
certain
a
constitutional
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
they
assert
a
first
amendment
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
suppose
to
remember
the
constitutional
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
they
did
assert
a
constitutional
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
is
pretty
hard
to
find
any
bad
faith
when
you
are
asserting
a
constitutional
right,
is
it
not?
