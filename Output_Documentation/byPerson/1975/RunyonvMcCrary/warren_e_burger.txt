chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-62,
runyon
against
mccrary
and
the
related
and
consolidated
cases.
mr.
koutoulakos,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
invite
the
offer,
is
that
your
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
suppose
a
man
is
running
in
contracting
business
and
he
puts
an
ad
in
the
paper
saying
that
he
needs
seven
bricklayers
and
five
plumbers
and
what
not.
he
is
then
inviting
applications,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
yes!
but
he
is
inviting
applications?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
he
announce
or
practice
a
universal
refusal
to
employ
any
person
of
a
particular
race,
where
would
he
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
building
an
interstate
highway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
you
have
done
since
this
lawsuit
started
is
not
relevant
to
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lipscomb.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
now
have
other
than
white
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o’clock.
mr.
lipscomb,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
the
issue
of
contract
come
up
with
respect
to
public
school
attendance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
setting
mr.
lipscomb,
would
sophisticated
people
such
as
you
would
have
in
the
congress,
including
lawyers
speak
of
the
right
to
attend
the
public
school
in
contract
terms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
might
conceivably
do
that
with
respect
to
higher
education
on
that
day
that
is
colleges
and
universities
where
you
pay
a
large
tuition
or
you
have
admission
requirements,
conceivably
that
would
be
embraced
in
terms
of
contract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
leonard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
of
the
appendix
is
that
on
mr.
leonard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
leonard.
mr.
brown,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brown
you
answer
a
hypothetical
question
referring
to
school.
suppose
a
particular
community,
a
diplomatic
community
in
washington
establishes
a
school
on
property
not
covered
by
diplomatic
community
and
the
requirement
for
admission
to
the
school
is
that
one
or
both
of
the
parents
be
nationals
of
the
spanish-speaking
country
and
this
will
be
obviously
the
diplomatic
community’s
means
of
preserving
the
culture
and
the
background
of
their
children.
do
you
think
1981
reaches
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
assuming
you
have
an
application
of
some
person
who
does
not
fit
that
category
and
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
assume
further
that
the
claim
is
made
that
in
operative
effect
this
excluded
over
racial
groups.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
mean
in
all
of
the
states
that
they
were
segregated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
states
that
do
not
permit
an
equivalent
education
by
private
tutors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
brown.
mr.
boggs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
about
two
other
federal
courts
have
already
passed
on
this
issue,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-62,
runyon
against
mccrary
and
three
related
cases
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
