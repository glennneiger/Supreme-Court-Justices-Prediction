justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
any
difficult
that
an
employer
says,
we
should
have,
as
a
private
employer,
the
right
to
choose
whom
he
wants
to
as
his
employee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
certainly
some
limitations
on
that
though?
i
mean,
could
the
state
then
require
accreditation
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
the
state
not
or
this
case,
congress
if
indeed
congress
did
say
so,
free
to
say
that
just
as
important
as
reading
and
writing
arithmetic
is
learning
in
an
integrated
environment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
will
not
distract
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
concede
that
even
though
a
parent
might
want
education
for
his
children
which
was
totally
deficient
in
the
three
i’s.
the
state
can
tell
that
parent,
no,
you
may
not
acquire
that
kind
of
education
even
in
a
private
school,
do
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
some
a
question
of
what
the
child
is
entitled
to,
it
is
the
question
of
what
limits
the
state
can
put
on
the
choice
of
the
parents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
is
still
good
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponents
were
rely
here
at
all
on
state
action
in
effect
saying
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
think
that
–-
mr.
brown,
do
you
not
think
there
might
be
some
significance
to
the
difference
in
the
introductory
language
between
1981
and
1982,
one
saying,
all
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
as
1981
does
and
1982
starting
with
different
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
senator
stewart
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
senator
stewart
of
nevada
was
the
one
who
introduced
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
he
not
thrusting
basically
at
a
fourteenth
amendment
type
of
right
rather
a
thirteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
that
would
be
on
a
clean
slate
that
might
be
a
very
logical
inference
where
you
would
not
get
that
sort
of
inference
from
1982
based
as
it
was
held
of
in
jones
on
the
thirteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
to
the
revised
statute
of
1875
because
they
contain
a
particular
provision
that
they
are
the
law
and
they
supersede
the
one
as
a
repealer
section
and
repeals
all
other
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
johnson
not
say
it
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
piece
of
legislation?
did
johnson
versus
rea
not
say
it
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
piece
of
legislation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
a
constitution
holding
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
it
cannot
be
(inaudible)
effect
of
a
constitutional
holding
against
the
plaintiffs?
i
suppose,
it
would
be
possible
for
the
court
to
decide
that
1981
did
not
reach
this
which
would
have
no
constitutional
implications
at
all?
