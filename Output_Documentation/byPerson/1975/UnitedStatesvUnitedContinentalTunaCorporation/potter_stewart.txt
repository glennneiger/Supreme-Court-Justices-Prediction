there
was
not
a
statutory
definition
of
the
term,
“public
vessel,”
why
did
congress
use
such
a
phrase,
it
is
not
--
there
had
been
a
development
of
definition
in
the
case
law,
in
the
admiralty
law?
justice
potter
stewart
generally
it
does
not
say
--
it
does
not
say
military
vessel
or
naval
vessel
or
anything
that
would
be
more
familiar,
a
public
vessel
does
not
certainly
have
very
much
of
a
common
name,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was,
where
did
the
phrase,
“public
vessel”
come
from?
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
have
any
case
law
meaning,
does
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
exactly,
quite
a
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
not
draw
a
definition,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
this?
by
implication
then,
a
public
vessel
is
any
vessel
owned
or
operated
by
the
united
states
is
not
a
merchant
vessel.
justice
potter
stewart
between
you
get
into
ambiguous
situations,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
cruise
ships
or
cargo
ships
chartered
by
the
navy
or
the
army
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
passenger
ships,
not
cruise
ships,
passenger
ships.
merchant
freighters?
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
vessel
would
that
be?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
concede,
i
think
you
have
in
your
brief,
mr.
kopp,
that
taking
the
language
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
as
amended
in
1960,
without
reference
to
any
other
legislation,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
correct
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
in
context
with
its
legislative
history.
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
least
one
other
limitation
of
importance
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
the
other
provision
that
at
least
in
time
of
war,
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
the
unreviewable
power
to
stay
all
proceedings.
justice
potter
stewart
your
definition
is
self-defining,
it
is
a
bootstrap
definition,
any
vessel
owned
and
operated
by
the
united
states
is
presumptively
owned
and
operated
for
the
interest
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
the
prime
example
of
a
merchant
vessel,
it
may
be
an
example
owned
by
the
united
states,
that
is
not
a
public
vessel.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
suggested
that
if
there
was
a
chartered
troop
carrier
here
and
that
it
had
been
involved
in
this
accident,
the
suit
would
have
had
been
under
the
suits
in
admiralty,
could
have
been.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
was
not
much
a
bearable
charter.
justice
potter
stewart
and
would
need
--
no
need
to
be
no
reciprocity?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
if
it
is
a
destroyer
that
was
escorting
the
ship
and
gets
in
the
accident,
there
must
be
reciprocity.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kopp,
if
you
are
correct
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
why
would
any
plaintiff
ever
proceed
under
the
public
vessels
act
rather
than
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
mr.
maclaughlin,
i
have
called
you
by
your—and
that
is
the,
that
is
the
same
kind
of
situation
mentioned
by
mr.
kopp,
you
cannot
think
of
anything
else,
any
other
possible
reason.
justice
potter
stewart
before
these
amendments,
there
were
certain
kinds
of
cases
that
did
not
fall
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
or
the
public
vessels
act,
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
there
were,
and
that
the
congress
was
aiming
at
curing
that--
justice
potter
stewart
but
those
cases
were
--
cases
before
1960
that
did
not
fall
under
either
one
of
those
acts
could
still
be
brought
under
some,
in
some
other
court,
could
be
brought
in
under
a
federal
tort
claim
or
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
potter
stewart
but
some
courts
held
that
they
could?
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
contract
can--
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
because
of
some
lack
of
authorization
to
bring
suit
or
what
is
because
there
was
not
any
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
there
is
something
in
these
amendments
that
would
indicate
that
a
suit
that
fell
outside
those
acts
before
the
amendment,
but
now
falls
within
one
of
the
other
or
both
of
them,
could
not
be
brought
in
court
of
claims
or
in
the
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
same
possibilities
there
was
before--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that,
let
as
assume
that
that
is
perfectly
clear,
but
what
if
you—what
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
the,
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
true
that
you
could
not
bring
it
in
the
court
of
claims?
