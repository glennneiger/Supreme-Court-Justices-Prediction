as

and

in

that

a

it
has
the
labor

everything
else
that

had

the
court

did

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
arises
out
of
the
collision
that
see
between
the
united
states
naval
destroyer
and
respondentâ€™s
fishing
vessel.
respondent,
a
philippine
corporation
brought
suit
against
united
states
for
damages
under
the
public
vessels
act
and
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
the
public
vessels
act
authorizes
suit
against
the
united
states
for
damages
caused
by
public
vessel
of
the
united
states,
but
the
public
vessels
act
contains
a
reciprocity
provision
that
bars
suit
by
a
foreign
national
unless
his
government
allows
the
united
states
nationals
to
sue
in
its
court
under
similar
circumstances.
on
the
united
states'
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
the
california
held
that
this
suit
could
be
brought
only
under
the
public
vessels
act
since
the
naval
destroyer
involved
was
indeed
a
public
vessel.
the
district
court
further
held
that
the
suit
was
barred
by
the
reciprocity
provision.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
suit
could
also
be
brought
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
which
contains
no
reciprocity
provision.
it
is
undisputed,
but
before
1960
suits
for
damages
caused
by
public
vessels
could
not
be
brought
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
however,
that
the
1960
amendment
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
had
the
effect
of
expanding
the
act
to
encompass
these
suits.
we
disagree.
the
amendment
in
question
did
not
explicitly
authorize
suits
previously
governed
by
the
public
vessel
act
to
be
brought
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
free
from
the
reciprocity
provisions
and
other
restrictive
provisions
of
the
public
vessel
act.
and
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
amendment
was
not
intended
to
accomplish
that
result.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
