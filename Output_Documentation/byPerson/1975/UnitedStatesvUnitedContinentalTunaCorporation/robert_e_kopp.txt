mr.
robert
e.
kopp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
congress
in
1960,
when
it
amended
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
repealed
by
implication
the
public
vessels
act
of
1925.
these
suits
in
admiralty
act,
in
general
expresses
the
consent
of
the
united
states
to
be
sued
in
admiralty.
the
public
vessels
act
however
contains
specific
requirements,
which
pertain
only
to
suits
involving
public
vessels.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
when
you
have
a
public
vessel
that
is
in
involved,
the
conditions
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
only
have
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
statutory
definition.
one
of
the
problems
in
the
litigation
is
what
is
the
effect
of
the
absence
of
no-definition
and
the
question
of
drawing
the
line
as
to
what
is
a
public
vessel
or
what
is
not
a
public
vessel.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
in
this
case,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
we
a
public
vessel
that
is
involved.
this
particular
case
arouse
as
the
result
of
a
collision
which
occurred
off
the
coast
of
california,
between
the
navy
destroyer
and
a
fishing
vessel
owned
by
the
respondent,
a
philippine
corporation.
although
i
might
add,
that
this
philippine
corporation,
in
turn
was
owned
by
american
stockholders.
the
collision
occurred
and
the
fishing
vessel,
according
to
the
compliant,
was
sunk,
the
respondent
then
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
alleging
jurisdiction
under
both
the
suits
and
admiralty
act
and
the
public
vessels
act.
the
government
moved
for
summary
judgment,
in
our
motion
we
argued
that
this
was
a
case
arising
under
the
public
vessels
act.
it
involved
a
pubic
vessel,
therefore
the
suit
had
to
satisfy
the
conditions
of
the
public
vessels
act,
which
included
a
requirement
of
a
showing
of
reciprocity
in
suits
by
for
national.
the
reciprocity
have
not
been
met
here
and
therefore
we
argued
that
the
suit
should
be
dismissed.
the
district
court
agreed
and
entered
summary
judgment
for
the
united
states,
the
court
of
appeals
however
reversed.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
as
it
currently
stands,
as
a
result
of
1960
amendment,
expresses
generally
the
consent
of
the
united
states
to
be
sued
in
admiralty.
no
longer
when
you
have
a
public
vessel
that
is
involved
although
prior
to
1960
you
had
to
do
so,
you
have
to
meet
the
specific
requirements
of
the
public
vessels
act.
accordingly,
the
court
found
that
since
the
general
conditions
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
had
been
satisfied,
that
the
suit
could
proceed
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
no,
prior
to
1960,
you
had
suits
involving
merchant
vessels,
which
could
be
brought
only
under
these
suits
in
admiralty
act.
suits
involving
public
vessels,
which
could
be
brought
only
under
the
public
vessels
act,
and
one
of
the
problems
in
this
particular
area,
which
i
will
get
to
in
discussing
the
legislative
history,
is
that
you
had
cases
that
did
not
fit
into
either
category.
where
there
was
not
a
public
vessel
involved,
there
was
not
a
merchant
vessel
involved,
and
it
was
very
difficult
if
you
had
a
contract
suit
because
this
means
you
had
to
sue
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
it
you
were
suing--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
because
the
public
vessels
act,
there
was
a
distinction
setup
between
a
public
vessel
act
--
between
public
vessel
and
a
merchant
vessel,
there
was
basic
--
there
was
a
basic
distinction
and
that
a
merchant
vessel
was
to
be
distinguished
from
a
public
vessel.
you
could
have
one
or
the
other,
this
was
a
rigid
dichotomy
that
was
set
out
and
you
could
not
in
fact
have
a
situation
where
you
had
a
suit
that
involved,
what
you
would
call
a
public
vessel
that
would
also
fall
into
the
merchant
vessel
category,
the
law
due
to
a
rigid
dichotomy.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
that
was
the
construction
of
the
statute,
but
that
was
done
explicitly
by
the
congress.
the
congress,
when
it
passed
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
in
fact,
intended
to
draw
a
rigid
dichotomy,
it
intended
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
to
deal
only
with
merchant
vessel
suits.
the
public
vessels
act
was
passed
five-years
later,
and
it
contained
additional
requirements
that
congress
felt
necessary
for
suits
involving
public
vessels
such
as
government
warships
for
instance.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
well,
in--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
well,
what
happened
was
that
shortly
before
these
two
statues
were
passed,
congress
decided,
or
this
court
decided
a
case
the
lake
monroe,
which
involved
a
statute
--
the
shipping
act,
whereby
congress
had
said
that
the
merchant
vessels
owned
by
the
united
states
were
subject
to
all
the
ordinary
rules
of
admiralty.
so
that
you
had
a
decision
of
this
court,
dealing
specifically
with
the
concept
of
merchant
vessels
that
said
that
merchant
vessels
of
the
united
states
could
be
sued
and
were
in
fact
subject
to
all
the
usual
admiralty
procedures.
so
in
reaction
to
this
decision,
the
congress
passed
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
and
the
congress
had
before
it
this
specific
situation
of
a
merchant
vessel
and
it
dealt
with
that
specific
situation.
there
was--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
there
was
in
fact
a
movement
in
the
congress
in
1920
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
to
cover
all
vessels
owned
by
the
united
states.
but
that
was
initially
defeated
because
the
congress
felt
that
there
were
further
problems,
if
you
had
suits
involving
warships
that
had
to
be
dealt
with,
and
there
was
a
need
for
time
to
think
about
these
particular
problems.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
the
phrase--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
no,
the
phrase
that
produced
the
case
was
really
was
not
public
vessel
but
was
merchant
vessel.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
that
is
right,
and
i
think
what
happened
was
that
back
in
1920,
everybody
had
in
mind
the
idea
that
all
vessels
of
the
united
states
were
in
one
sense
public
vessels.
but
there
was
this
fixed
judicial
construction
of
what
was
a
merchant
vessel,
so
the
congress
drew
the
definition
or
drew
the
line--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
it
did
because
it
confined
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
only
to
merchant
vessels.
and
then--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right
you
had--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
now
the
government’s--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
well,
actually
what
happened
was--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right
you
had
some
very
difficult
situations
that
arose
as
to
what
was
a
merchant
vessel
or
what
was
a
public
vessel.
and
this
led
to
a
very
difficult
problem
for
litigants
because
it
was
all
right
to
them
if
they
had
a
suit,
if
they
could
show
that
their
suit
involved
a
merchant
or
that
involved
a
public
vessel,
because
then
they
were
guaranteed
to
be
able
to
bring
suit
in
the
district
court.
but
there
were
some
very
difficult
problems
in
drawing
the
line,
there
was
some
cases
where
you
had
a
situation
where
a
court
might
very
well
say
this
suit
did
not
involve
a
public
vessel,
this
suit
did
not
involve
a
merchant
vessel,
therefore
it
does
not
fall
under
either
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
or
the
public
vessels
act.
and
if
you
had
a
contract--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
well,
take
for
instance
the
situation
of
a
privately
owned
vessel,
which
is
chartered
by
the
government
and
used
by
the
government
to
carry
war
materials.
now,
this
is
a
situation
that
would
not
involve
a
case
to
be
brought
under
the
public
vessels
act
because
you
had
a
privately
owned
vessel,
so
the
public
vessels
act
was
out.
now,
according
to
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
by
judge
vernon
hand
(ph),
this
also
involved
the
case
where
you
did
not
have
a
merchant
vessel
because
the
ship
was
not
being
operated
to
carry
merchant
cargo,
who
is
being
operated
to
carry
public
cargo,
war
material.
so,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
calmar
steamship
case,
this
particular
situation
fell
under
neither
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
nor
the
public
vessels
act.
therefore
the
court
said
since
you
had
a
contract
claim
that
was
involved
and
since
your
contract
claim
was
for
more
than
$10,000.00,
this
suit
could
be
brought
only
in
the
court
of
claims.
now
that
second
circuit
decision
was
in
fact
reversed
by
this
court,
but
the
example
of
the
second
circuit
decision
was
fresh
on
the
minds
of
the
drafters
in
congress
of
the
1960
amendment,
and
the
calmar
steamship
case
was
in
fact
one
of
the
situations
that
they
attempted
to
deal
with
in
the
1960
amendment.
now
the
1960
amendment
was
passed
by
congress
because
of
this
very
problem
demonstrated
by
the
calmar
case,
where
you
had
cases
that
did
not
fall
into
the
category
of
public
vessels
or
merchant
vessels,
and
they
could
very
well
fall
into
the
court
of
claims.
and
what
congress
did
to
deal
with
this
problem
in
1960,
it
did
two
things;
it
eliminated
the
old
distinction
that
you
had
between
merchant
vessels
and
public
vessels,
because
this
distinction
could
throw
some
cases
out
of
either
classification.
secondly,
congress
wanted
to
make
it
very
clear
that
all
miscellaneous
type
of
cases,
all
cases
that
were
hard
to
classify
but
were
in
admiralty,
would
fall
into
the
district
courts.
so
this
led
to
the
1960
amendments
and
the
specific
language,
which
we
now
have
before
this
court.
the
congress
amended
the
language
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
in
742
to
come
to
its
present
meaning,
which
is
set
forth
on
page
three,
in
cases
where
if
such
vessel
were
privately
owned
or
operated
or
if
such
cargo
were
privately
owned
or
possessed,
now
here
is
what
was
added
in
1960,
“or
if
a
private
person
or
property
were
involved,
a
proceeding
in
admiralty
could
be
maintained.”
the
1960
amendment
added
the
language,
“or
if
a
private
person
or
property
were
involved,”
it
also
subtracted
former
language
in
that
section
which
had
included
a
proviso
that,
that
section
apply
--
only
were
merchant
vessels
were
involved.
so
you
eliminated,
the
congress
eliminated
the
old
distinction
between
merchant
vessels
and
public
vessels.
further
the
congress
in
this
--
or
if
a
private
person
or
property
language
added
language
to
the
act
that
was
in
fact
as
broad
as
the
scope
of
the
entire
admiralty
jurisdiction,
and
it
did
this
to
make
it
clear
that
all
admiralty
cases
against
the
united
states
would
now
come
into
the
district
courts.
you
could
no
longer
have
the
problem
of
cases
falling
into
the
court
of
claims.
now,
the
respondent
argues
that
this
change
had
the
consequence
of
arising
the
public
vessels
act.
the
public
vessels
act
prior
to
this
time
clearly
applied
only
to
public
vessels
and
the
respondent
now
contends
that
because
its
situation,
of
situation
involving
the
public
vessel,
is
a
situation
where
if
a
private
person
or
property
were
involved,
a
proceeding
could
be
maintained,
that
now
it
could
maintain
its
action
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
but
congress
did
not
feel
it
necessary,
when
it
was
amending
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
in
1960
to
mention
the
public
vessels
act
for
a
very
particular
reason.
and
that
was
because
the
public
vessels
act
in
section
782
contains
language,
which
in
effect
makes
it
clear
that
when
there
is
any
conflict
between
the
public
vessels
act
and
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
the
public
vessels
act
must
prevail.
now,
this
particular
language
is
the
language
that
set
out
at
the
bottom
of
page
four
of
our
brief,
in
section
782
of
the
public
vessels
act.
section
782,
in
the
very
last
sentence
provides
such
suits,
now
those
are
suits
set
out
in
section
781
above
for
damages
caused
by
a
public
vessel
of
the
united
states.
such
suits
shall
be
subject
to
and
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
chapter
20
of
this
title,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
or
any
amendment
thereof
insofar
as
the
same
are
not
inconsistent
here
with.
in
other
words,
we
have
in
section
782
a
specific
provision
that
declares
that
in
the
event
of
any
conflict
between
the
two
statutes,
the
terms
of
the
public
vessels
act
must
prevail.
thus,
in
1960
congress
felt
no
need
to
include
any
expressed
guarantees,
the
public
vessels
act
was
not
being
repealed
because
it
could
rest
confidently
upon
this
language
in
section
782
to
prevent
this
result.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
if
the
language
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
is
read
in
isolation
and
by
itself.
but
we
would
submit
that
if
that
language
is
read
in
context,
and
in
context
with
the
public
vessels
act
--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
and
also
in
context
with
its
legislative
history,
a
totally
different
result
is
reached
because
we
have
this
very
provision
that
reconciles
the
two
statutes.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
okay,
in
this
particular
case,
the
public
vessels
act
contains
a
reciprocity
requirement
in
section
785,
it
provides
no
suits,
and
this
is
at
the
top
of
page
five,
no
suit
may
be
brought
under
section
781
to
790
of
this
title.
that
actually
means
under
this
act,
that
is
the
way
it
was
in
the
original
statutes,
by
a
national
--of
any
foreign
government
unless
it
shall
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court.
that
said
government
under
similar
circumstances
allows
nationals
of
the
united
states
to
sue
in
its
court.
now,
one
could
in
fact
read
that
provision
as
not
creating
a
conflict
with
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
but
it’s
plain
meaning
and
intent
is
that
obviously
congress
felt
that
if
you
had
a
suit
involving
a
public
vessel
of
the
united
states,
and
a
foreign
national
were
involved,
a
foreign
national
could
not
bring
that
suit
unless
he
could
meet
a
showing
of
reciprocity.
and
it
certainly
inconsistent
with
that
interpretation
of
section
785,
to
then
turn
around
and
say
that
the
foreign
national
however
could
bring
suit
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
the
congress
would
in
fact
be
giving
foreign
nationals
a
more
favored
status
than
they
would
be
giving
their
own
citizens,
because
american
citizens
in
suits
involving
public
vessels
would
have
to
sue
under
the
public
vessels
act.
so
that
is
why
we
say
there
is
a
conflict,
it
is
not
a
strictly
--
it
is
not
a
conflict
that
is
inherent
as
a
matter
of
linguistics,
but
i
think
in
terms
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutes,
the
conflict
is
quite
obvious.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
now
the
public
vessels
act
was
enacted
because
there
were
certain
requirements
that
congress
felt
really
were
essential
in
suits
involving
public
vessels,
and
there
are
only
a
handful
of
such
requirements.
perhaps
the
one
that
was
most
in
the
forefront
of
the
congress
at
the
time
that
it
was
enacting
the
public
vessels
act
was
a
provision,
which
is
now
in
section
784
of
the
public
vessels
act
that
is
not
in
our
brief.
section
784,
which
provides
that
subpoenas
may
not
be
issued
to
the
members
of
the
crew
of
a
public
vessel
without
the
consent
of
the
captain
or
the
secretary
of
the
department
concerned.
this
was
a
condition
that
the
congress
felt
was
unique
to
public
vessels
and
it
was
very
important
to
have
that
in
there
because
if
you
had
a
suit
involving
a
warship,
it
would
be
intolerable
to
permit
the
vessel
to
be
tied
up
at
a
dock
while
its
crew
members
were
off
testifying
in
court,
so
that
is
why
we
have
section
784.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
in
1944
that
provision
was
enacted
and
it
gives
the
secretary
the
automatic
right
to
require
a
stay
of
all
proceedings
under
the
public
vessels
act.
these
provisions
would
as
a
practical
matter
be
totally
voided
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
would
permit
anybody
to
bring
a
suit
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
today
instead
of
the
public
vessels
act.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
a
public
vessel,
we
would
submit
means
a
vessel
that
is
owned
by
the
united
states
and
operated
solely
for
governmental
purpose.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
would
be.
this
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
situation
for
instance
where
you
have
the
united
states
which
charters
a
vessel
but
with
a
private
crew,
and
that
crew
remains
in
control
of
the
vessel
throughout
the
voyage.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
if
the
united
states
in
fact
has
a
bareboat
charter,
a
charter
where
it
requires
ownership
for
the
purpose
of
the
voyage.
government
ownership
is
a
prerequisite--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
the
equivalent
of
ownership.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right.
this--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right
and
it
is
a
public
vessel,
but
it
is
not
a
merchant
vessel,
a
vessel
has
been
operated
for
higher
--
the
typical
situation
involving
a
merchant
vessel
is
a
situation
that
arises
where
the
government
to
develop
the
merchant
marine
has
to
build
and
own
a
freighter,
for
instance,
because
there
is
not
simply
enough
capacity
in
the
private
industry
to
do
so.
so
the
government
builds
this
freighter,
it
has
title
to
the
freighter
and
then
it
lets
it
out
to
government
contractors
who
use
it
in
ordinary
commercial
intercourse,
now
that
is
the
prime
example
of
a
merchant
vessel.
but--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
it
is
not
a
public
vessel,
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
if
it
was
operated
as
a
troop
transport
for
instance
--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
if
it
was
in
fact
owned
and
operated
by
the
united
states,
as
opposed
to
a
government
contract,
i
would
say
that
would
be
a
public
vessel.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
no,
because
it
would
not
be
operated
for
private
profit,
it
would
be
operated
for
the
public
interest.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
i
am
not
saying
that
drawing
the
line
today
between
merchant
vessel
and
public
vessel
is
a
totally
automatic
thing.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
the
1960
amendment
was
not
enacted
because
of
the
problem
of
drawing
the
distinction
per
se
between
public
vessels
and
merchant
vessels,
rather
it
was
drawn
because
you
could
have
cases
where
you
had
neither
a
public
vessel
nor
a
merchant
vessel.
see,
the
public
vessel-merchant
vessel
distinction
could
throw
some
cases
into
the
court
of
claims,
and
that
was
why
the
1960
amendment
was
enacted.
now
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
it
would
depend
on
how
the
government
had
chartered.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
okay
then,
it
would
be
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
and
that
is--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
there
would
need
to
be
no
reciprocity,
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
that
is
right,
this
is
the
holding
go
the
calmer
steamship
case
in
this
court,
where
a
court
was
faced
with
this
very
similar
problem.
a
private
vessel
transporting
troops
and
war
material
and
manned
by
a
private
crew,
and
the
court
there
in
effect
said
that
the
consequence
of
our
holding
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
merchant
vessel
would
be
to
throw
this
suit
into
the
court
of
claims.
therefore,
because
we
do
not
think
the
court
of
claims
is
properly
an
admiralty
court,
we
are
going
to
conclude
essentially
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
we
have
a
merchant
vessel
involved
in
this
situation,
and
therefore,
the
plaintiff
could
bring
suit
in
the
district
court
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
and
it
was
because
of
a
problem
as
was
presented
by
the
calmer
case
that
the
1960
amendment
was
enacted.
now,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
any
way
that
congress
intended
to
repeal
the
public
vessels
act.
congress
was
concerned
with
this
very
specific
problem
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims,
in
relation
to
the
district
courts,
the
public
vessels
act
was
not
amended
in
any
way.
in
the
legislative
history,
there
is
absolutely
no
discussion
at
all
that
the
terms
of
the
public
vessels
act
are
onerous
or
unjust.
when
we
think
of
congress
was
going
about
repealing
the
public
vessels
act,
at
the
very
least
there
would
be
some
discussion
along
those
lines.
there
is
no
discussion
of
any
of
the
differences
between
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
the
public
vessels
act.
again,
if
congress
were
rationally
going
to
go
about
repealing
the
two
statutes,
it
would
expect
at
least
the
bare
minimum
of
discussion
for
instance
as
to
why
it
is
unjust
to
have
a
reciprocity
requirement.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
well,
our
position
is
not
just
that
because
we
say
that
on
the
face
of
the
statutes,
when
they
are
read
in
context--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
because
of
the
existence
of
another
statute,
which
indicates
how,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
should
be
read
and
silenced.
and
of
course,
we
have
in
this--
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
there
is
absolutely
no
intent
at
all
reflected
in
that
legislative
history
to
repeal
the
public
vessels
act.
we
have
here
really
a
classic
case
of
repeal
by
implication
or
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
congress
without
thinking
about
the
public
vessels
act,
just
simply
--
and
not
amended
in
any
way
simply
repealed
it.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
well
is
it
in
fact
a
repealer,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
reason
is
because
the
public
vessels
act
consists
of
a
series
of
extra
conditions,
more
onerous
conditions,
that
congress
has
imposed
upon
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
for
suits
involving
public
vessels
so
that
no
plaintiff
today
given
his
choice
between
the
two
statutes
is
going
to
sue
under
the
public
vessels
act.
he
is
always
going
to
sue
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
because
the
public
vessels
act
for
him
simply
means
more
trouble,
for
instance
the
rules
on
interest
are
less
favorable.
mr.
robert
e.
kopp
but
no
one--
no
litigant
in
the
right
mind
will
ever
choose
to
apply
the
public
vessels
act
because
they
have
available
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
which
is
a
more
favorable
statute.
now
there
is
one
situation
where
the
public
vessels
act
is
in
fact
more
favorable
to
litigants
and
that
is
in
the
area
of
venue.
the
public
vessels
act
and
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
both
provide
that
when
you
have
a
suit
that
is
brought
in
the
district
where
the
vessel
could
be
found
you
have
to
bring
suit
in
that
district.
if
the
vessel
cannot
be
found
then
you
can
bring
the
suit
in
the
district
where
the
plaintiff
has
his
place
of
business
or
residence,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
then
stops
there
but
the
public
vessels
act
goes
on
to
say,
if
the
suit—if
the
vessel
cannot
be
found
or
if
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
his
place
of
residence
then
you
can
bring
suit
in
any
court.
and
--
so
in
a
situation
where
the
vessel
cannot
be
found
and
the
plaintiff
has
not
place
and
residence,
he
might
be
able
to
get
venue
under
the
public
vessels
act
but
not
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
but
that
is
not
a
very
real
distinction
because
why
would
congress
have
set
up
a
statutory
scheme
that
turns
for
instance
on
where
you
could
find
venue.
further,
virtually
all
public
vessels
at
some
point
within
a
two-year
period
return
to
the
united
states
and
can
be
found
within
the
united
states,
so
that
this
little
distinction
really,
is
meaningless.
