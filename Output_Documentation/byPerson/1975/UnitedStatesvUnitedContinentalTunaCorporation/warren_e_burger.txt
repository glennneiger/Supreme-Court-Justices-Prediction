we
will
hear
arguments
first
this

continental
tuna
corporation.
mr.
kopp,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
mr.
kopp.
mr.
maclaughlin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
a
different
analogy
mr.
maclaughlin,
i
thought
they
were
just
opposing
the
position
of
an
american
national
damaged
by
a
philippine
ship
and
comparing
his
right
to
sue
in
philippine
courts,
is
that
not
the
way
he
argued?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--is
it
not
that
the
heart
of
the
reciprocity
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
fact
that
our
statute
is
unfair
in
some
respect,
does
that
make
it
totally
vulnerable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
there
is
something
inherently
unfair
about
the
statute,
which
provides
that
foreign
nationals
can
sue
in
the
american
courts
under
cover,
if
the
nation
of
that
foreign
national
extends
the
same
right
to
american
citizens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
heart
of
a
reciprocity
statute
always,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
does
not
address
itself
to
the
reciprocity
issue,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

main
brief.
