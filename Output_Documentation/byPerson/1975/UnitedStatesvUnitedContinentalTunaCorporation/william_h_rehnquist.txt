justice
william
h.
rehnquist
prior
to
1960,
mr.
kopp,
as
i
understand
it
an
action
could
be
brought
against
a
government
owned
merchant
vessel
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
would
that
have
been
a
public
vessel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
could
you
not
sue
under
the
suits
of
an
admiralty
act,
if
you
were
suing
the
united
states
owned
merchant
vessel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
public
vessels
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
really,
your
argument
at
best
is
by
analogy
there,
is
it
not.
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right,
the
public
vessels
act
remains
as
a
source
of
authority
for
bringing
suits,
did
just
another
statute
has
been
expanded
to
overlap
with
it
a
great
deal,
maybe
you
have
got
argument
by
analogy
but
it
is
not
a
repealer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
still
there
and
it
could
apply
to
his
case
if
he
chose
to
have
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
doubt
that
would
have
been
the
result
before
the
1960
amendment
is
it?
