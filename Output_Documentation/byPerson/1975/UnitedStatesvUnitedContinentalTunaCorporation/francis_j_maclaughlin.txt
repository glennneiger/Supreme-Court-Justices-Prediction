mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
discussion
of
this
case
by
asking
the
court
to
consider
in
practical
terms,
the
significance
of
this
decision
in
what
the
government
is
asking
as
to
hold.
now,
if
the
role
of
tortfeasor,
an
innocent
victim
in
this
collision
were
reversed,
that
is
if
the
philippine
vessel
had
been
negligent
and
if
were
the
government’s
vessel
which
were
damaged
or
sunk,
the
government’s
remedies
are
quite
clear.
and
there
is
no
question
at
all
about
what
they
could
have
that
philippine
vessel
arrested
and
sold
interim
if
necessary
in
order
to
satisfy
their
damage
claim.
also
they
could
commence
an
in
personam
action
against
the
philippine
owner
here
in
the
courts
of
our
country,
as
the
government
has
done
in
the
past,
and
it
has
standing
to
do
it
in
the
courts
of
the
philippines
or
in
any
other
civilized
nation
which
follows
the
general
maritime
law.
now,
that
would
be
the
situation
where
the
government
has
been
damaged,
but
in
this
case,
it
is
the
philippine
ship
owner
who
has
been
damaged
and
it
is
the
government
we
allege
which
has
been
negligent.
what
the
government
in
effect
is
saying
in
this
lawsuit
as
i
understand
their
position,
is
that
liability
or
rising
from
ship
collisions
in
these
circumstances
should
be
a
one-way
street.
if
the
government
has
been
damaged
it
has
a
right
to
recover,
but
if
a
philippine
ship
owner
has
been
unfortunate
enough
to
have
suffered
damage
as
a
result
of
a
collision,
he
has
no
right
to
sue--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
sure
i
listened
closely
enough
to
answer
your
question,
but--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well,
that
is
the
way
the
statue
is
worded,
and
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting
is
unfair
about
it.
because
here
is
this
portal
philippine
ship
owner
and
the
united
states
can
sue
him,
they
can
sell
his
vessel
interim
to
pay
their
damage
claim,
but
the
government
says
he
has
no
claim
against
them.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
no,
your
honor.
i
do
want
to
discuss
the
statute
itself
by
i
started
out
by
asking
the
court
to
consider
the
case
in
terms
of
practical,
equitable
considerations.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
a
result,
which
deprives
a
philippine
ship
owner
of
his
right
to
recover
his
damages
from
the
government,
is
basically
unfair.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
no
question
at
all.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
that
is
the
way
it
has
operated
forever--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
it
is
exactly
the
opposite--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
mr.
chief
justice
white.
they
are
construed
liberally,
liberally
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
that
is
correct
and
several
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
and
this
court
itself--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well
that
is
correct
but
the
waiver
once
made
by
congress
is
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
claimants.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well
these
are
really
reverse
sides
of
the
same
coin,
the
government
says
we
cannot
be
sued
unless
we
have
consented
to
be
sued,
and
this
consent
is
liberally
construed
under
the
cases
as
we
read
them.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well,
if
the
same
right
were
extended
to
american
citizens
there,
there
would
be
nothing
unfair
about
it.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well
that
is
the
way
the
statute
is
phrased,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
unfair
is
how
about
the
individual
philippine
citizen
who
can
be
sued
in
his
own
country
by
the
united
states,
or
he
can
be
sued
here
to
satisfy
their
damage
claim.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
is
unfair
to
deny
equal
rights
to
him
as
against
the
united
states.
now
there
may
well
be
god
reasons,
in
fact
i
am
persuaded
that
there
are
to
deny
the
philippine
government
or
any
government
which
refuses
to
submit
to
sue,
to
deny
them
the
right
to
recover
from
the
united
states.
but
it
is
basically
unfair
to
deny
an
individual
citizen,
who
is
subject
to
the
united
states’
claim,
equal
and
reciprocal
rights
under
the
law.
now,
we
believe
that
congress,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
we
believe
that
congress
by
this
act
as
amended
in
1960
has
abolished
the
pre-existing
distinction,
which
existed
between
public
vessels
and
merchant
vessels.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
recites
according
to
the
senate
report,
that
a
substantial
portion
of
a
jurisdictional
uncertainty
in
this
area
is
attributable
to
the
confusion
in
establishing
whether
a
vessel
is
a
merchant
vessel
or
a
public
vessel.
and
the
courts
in
the
late
40's
and
early
50's
had
tremendous
difficulty
trying
to
decide
what
were
public
vessels
and
what
were
merchant
vessels
and
was
there
a
gap
between
them.
and
the
senate
and
the
house
looked
at
this
confusion
and
their
report
reflects
that
they
were
concerned
about
it.
and
at
the
bottom
or
after
reciting
a
number
of
these
cases,
the
senate
report
reflects
what
the
senate
wanted
to
do
about
it,
and
it
says
that
the
decisive
question
in
a
lawsuit
should
as
far
as
possible
be
its
merits
and
not
assert
here
technical
problems
of
procedure.
so
this
was
the
senate’s
attitude
and
this
was
a
house’s
attitude
when
it
considered
the
1960
amendment.
we
know
that
they
were
upset
about
the
confusion,
we
know
that
they
were
upset
about
the
technical
disposition
of
cases
and
that
they
desire
these
cases
to
be
heard
against
government
on
their
merits.
now
the
statute,
which
they
adopted,
is
perfectly
plain,
it
eliminated
the
old
restriction
concerning
merchant
vessels
so
that
the
statute
as
now
worded
applies
generally
to
all
types
of
vessels.
and
so
the
statute
on
its
face
is
plain.
the
government
says
that
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
intent
we
will
see
that
congress
really
intended
after
all
to
preserve
the
public
vessels
distinction
and
to
separate
out
from
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
damage
caused
by
public
vessels.
but
the
legislative
history
is
completely
silent
on
that.
the
government
has
been
unable
to
show
or
to
invite
our
attention
to
any
portion
of
the
legislative
history,
which
would
show
that.
indeed,
if
i
may
say
so,
or
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
this
court’s
earlier
decision
in
amell
versus
united
states,
which
was
decided
in
1966,
shortly
after
this
act
was
amended.
the
court
stated
in
that
case
that
the
old
distinction
was
abolished,
and
the
government’s
brief
in
that
case
which
is
a
part
of
the
records
of
this
court
is
here
before
me,
and
if
i
may
quote
from
page
19,
the
government
at
that
time
reviewed
these
jurisdictional
problems
and
then
said,
the
same
problem
that
congress
in
the
1960
act
to
abolish
the
distinction
between
public
and
merchant
government
vessels
which
had
caused
uncertainty
and
led
to
frequent
misfilings.
so
this
was
a
position
of
the
government
in
1965
when
this
issue
was
last
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
no,
it
does
not.
it
addresses
itself
to
the
meaning
and
interpretation
and
purpose
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
is
amended
in
1960
abolished
the
merchant-public
vessel
distinction
and
now
encompasses
claims
caused
by
any
type
of
vessel.
i
am
suggesting,
in
fact
i
am
inviting
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
was
precisely
the
government’s
position
when
it
presented
its
brief
to
the
court
in
connection
with
the
amell
case.
now,
the
government
council
has
made
an
argument
here
this
morning
which
i
did
not
see
in
his
brief,
although
it
may
well
be
there,
and
he
has
invited
our
attention
to
this
sentence
which
appears
in
section
782
of
the
public
vessels
act.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
i
am
on
page
four
of
the
petitioner’s
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
sentence
to
which
council
invited
our
attention
reads,
such
suit
shall
be
subject
to
and
proceed
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
20
of
this
title,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
or
any
amendment
thereof,
insofar
as
the
same
are
not
consistent
here
with.
i
think
what
council
has
suggested,
or
what
he
means
to
suggest,
is
that
this
sentence
means
that
when
there
is
an
overlap
of
between
the
acts
that
the
claimant
must
proceed
under
the
public
vessels
act.
now,
i
do
not
read
it
that
way,
i
think
what
this
says
is
that
when
the
claimant
is
proceeding
under
the
public
vessels
act,
the
procedure
then
will
be
as
specified
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
except
where
the
public
vessels
act
otherwise
provides.
it
does
not
say
that
a
claimant
must
proceed
in
the
event
of
an
overlap
of
jurisdiction.
it
does
not
say
that
a
claimant
must
proceed
under
the
public
vessels
act
or
that
in
that
event
the
public
vessels
act
supersedes
the
provisions
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
i
think
such
suits
refer
to
suits,
which
are
brought
under
the
public
vessels
act.
and
in
this
saying,
that
when
a
claimant
sues
under
the
public
vessels
act,
that
claim
will
be
heard
in
accordance
with
the
public
vessels
act
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
except
when
these
provisions
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
are
inconsistent.
in
other
words,
it
is
prescribing
a
procedure
to
be
followed
when
a
claim
is
made
under
the
public
vessels
act,
but
it
does
not
say,
i
respectfully
submit,
it
does
not
say
that
a
claimant
must
proceed
under
this
act.
and
it
does
not
say,
that
in
the
event
of
dual
coverage
under
the
acts,
that
the
public
vessels
act
supersedes
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
is
the
one,
which
the
court
of
appeals
suggested,
and
that
is
that
the
venue
provisions
are
slightly
different
in
a
particular
case,
it
might
well
be
that
a
claimant
could
not
secure
venue
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
but
could
do
so
under
the
public
vessels
act.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
no,
i
cannot
and
that
is
the
only
situation
that
i
can
think
of.
we
have
an
alternative
theory
of
recovery,
which
we
have
presented
to
the
district
court
and
to
the
court
of
appeal,
and
if
for
some
reason
this
court
decides
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeal
on
the
suits
in
admiralty
issue,
we
would
respectfully
request
that
it
consider
our
claim
under
the
public
vessels
act.
and
in
particular,
we
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
admiralty
doctrine,
under
which
a
ship
owner’s
nationality
is
determined
according
to
the
nationality
of
the
real
or
beneficial
owner
of
the
company.
we
look
through
the
technical
state
of
incorporation
and
it
is
only
right
in
this
day
and
age
that
we
do
so
because
many
ship
owners
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere
incorporate
and
register
vessels
under
flags
of
convenience
and
you
cannot
tell
anything
about
their
nationality.
and
they
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
escape
from
liabilities,
which
are
rightfully
imposed
or
would
be
imposed
against
them
in
their
own
country.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
a
basis
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
did
not
rule
upon
our
alternative
theory.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
there
was
real
question
as
to
whether
or
not--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
i
take
it.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
well,
the
courts
were
in
conflict
on
that
issue
because
there
was
a
real
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
vessel
caused
claim
would
lie
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
or
under
any
other
act.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
i
think
most
of
them
held
that
they
could
not,
so
that
if
a
claimant--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
that
is
right.
so
that
if
a
claimant
unfortunately
could
not
bring
himself
within
the
definition
of
a
public
vessel
nor
within
the
definition
of
a
merchant
vessel
he
had
no
remedy.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
i
think
the
courts
construed
it
as
a
lack
of
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
government
just--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
no.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
no,
i
take
not,
because
the
language
adopted
in
1960
is
far
broader,
it
says
that
if
where
if
a
vessel
were
privately
owned,
a
proceeding--
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
it
could
not,
because
the
federal
tort
claims
act
contains
a
provision,
which
says
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
then
it
will
not
lie
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
francis
j.
maclaughlin
i
am
not
aware
of
the
rule
with
respect
to
that
court.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
be
happy
to
try
to
answer
any
further
questions
of
the
court
but
if
there
are
none
i
have
nothing
further.
