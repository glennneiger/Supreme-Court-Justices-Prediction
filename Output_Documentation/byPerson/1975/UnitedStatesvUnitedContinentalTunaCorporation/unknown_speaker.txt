[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
excuse
me
i
do
not
want
to
interrupt
you.
unknown
speaker
and
your
emphasis
is
on
the
insofar
as
i
seem
are
not
inconsistently
with?
unknown
speaker
well
what
is
the
inconsistency?
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the,
mr.
kopp,
to
your
colloquial
with
mr.
justice
stewart.
what
is
your
submission
as
to
the
limit
of
public
vessel?
unknown
speaker
as
for
example,
a
coastguard
dredge,
that
dredge
is
a
harbor.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
public
vessel.
unknown
speaker
but
even
in
cases
i
gathered
chartered
vessels,
you
may
have
a
public
vessel,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
with
ownership,
but
on
a
bareboat
charter
would
it
have
to
be--
unknown
speaker
and
the
united
states
would
have
to
provide
its
own
crew?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
you
may
read
the
statute
different
from
what
it
says
on
its
face
just
because
of
congressional
silence
and
the
existence
of
other
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
have
just
said,
i
said
on
the
face
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
you
read
them,
you
do
not
read
the
words
the
way
they
appear
to
read
because
of
the
existence
of
another
statute
and
silence.
unknown
speaker
well
the
legislative
history
you
are
referring
to
is
silence.
unknown
speaker
that
was
clearly
true
before
1960--
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
need
expressed
waivers
by
congress,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
the
waiver
here
is,
with
respect
to
all
kinds
of
government
vessels.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
a
sovereign,
is
it
a
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well
the
fact
was
provocative
and
the
emphasis
to
the
first
few
words,
such
suits
shall
be
subject
to--.
