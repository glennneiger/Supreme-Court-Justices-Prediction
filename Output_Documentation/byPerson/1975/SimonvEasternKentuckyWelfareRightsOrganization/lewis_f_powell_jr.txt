justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
plaintiffs
are
indigents
and
their
organizations.
they
brought
this
class
action
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue.
they
attack
the
validity
of
the
irs
revenue
ruling
that
extends
favorable
tax
treatment
to
non
profit
hospitals
that
generally
serve
the
community.
ruling
entitles
donors
to
take
tax
deductions
on
gifts
to
these
hospitals.
the
ruling
applies,
even
though
indigents
are
not
served.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
validity
of
the
tax
ruling,
but
we
do
not
reach
the
merits
and
we
conclude
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
allege
a
case
or
controversy
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
although
they
do
allege
denial
of
hospital
services,
because
of
their
indigency
they
failed
to
name
any
hospital
as
a
defendant,
the
only
defendants
are
treasury
officials.
nor
does
it
complaint
aver
that
the
hospitals
that
denied
the
service
were
dependent
upon
tax
deductible
contributions.
thus
it
is
wholly
speculative,
so
far
as
the
complaint
shows,
whether
the
tax
rulings
bears
any
relation
to
denial
of
the
service.
we
conclude,
therefore,
that
respondents
failed
to
establish
their
standing
to
bring
this
suit.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is,
therefore,
vacated
and
the
case
remanded.
mr.
justice
stewart
filed
a
concurrent
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
joins.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
decisions
of
the
case.
