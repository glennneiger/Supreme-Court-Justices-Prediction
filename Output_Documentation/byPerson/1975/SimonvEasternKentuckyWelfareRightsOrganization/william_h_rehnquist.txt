justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
rose,
may
i
ask
you
a
kind
of
a
preliminary
question
as
to
how
you
plan
to
structure
your
argument?
are
you
going
to
discuss
a
standing
at
the
anti-injunction
act
and
sovereign
immunity
at
the
latter
part
of
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about,
you
say
very
little
in
your
reply
brief
about
our
decision
last
spring
in
warth
against
seldin.
now,
do
you
not
think
that
has
some
bearing
on
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yours
is
kind
of
a
house-of-jack
bill
type
of
causation.
the
same
is
warth
as
i
see
it,
where
it
is
not
just
a
direct
causation,
but
it
is,
if
(a)
had
not
done
this,
then
(b)
would
have
done
this,
then
(c)
would
have
done
that
and
my
people
would
have
been
okay.
it
is
a
fairly
attenuated
kind
of
standing,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
statute
intended
to
confer
any
discreet
rights
on
your
clients?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
--
go
ahead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
entertained
an
action
of
this
kind
where
is
that
the
claimed
beneficiaries
of
a
tax
deduction
as
attenuated
in
situation
as
yours?
what
is
the
closest
case
and
point
from
this
court
which
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
immunity
and
the
anti-injunction
act,
you
have
come
to
those?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
do
not
rely
on
scan,
well,
then
you
simply
rely
on
larson?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
not
a
case
in
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
hospitals
were
parties
to
this
action
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
the
government
ever
move
to
dismiss
the
action
on
the
basis
of
failure
to
join
indispensable
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
now
that-that
--
that
is
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
district
court
had
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
would
that
have
had
financial
consequences
to
hospitals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
from
the
indispensable
parties’
point
of
view,
the
only
answer
that
would
have
been
to
enjoin
to
every
single
hospital
that
pays
taxes
in
the
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
if,
if
it
turns
on
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question,
then
if
the
ruling
would
have
changed
the
liability
of
some
hospital,
would
your
answer
then
be
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
can
the
commissioner
or
the
secretary
be
sued
in
any
one
of
the
ninety-three
judicial
districts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
know,
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
litigation
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
i
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bob
jones
came
up
out
of
the
fourth
circuit,
did
he
not?
