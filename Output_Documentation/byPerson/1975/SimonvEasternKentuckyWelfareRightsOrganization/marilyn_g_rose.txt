ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
marilyn
rose.
i
represent
the
plaintiffs,
petitioners
in
number
74-1110
and
respondents
in
number
74-1124.
this
case
involves
the
legality
of
a
revenue
ruling,
issued
by
the
internal
revenue
service
in
1969.
this
revenue
ruling
removed
the
long
standing,
decades
old,
free
service
requirement,
which
had
always
been
required
of
charitable
hospitals.
there
was
no
notice
given
to
anyone
when
this
ruling
issued.
there
was
no
opportunity
given
to
anyone,
to
public
at
large
or
affected
persons
to
comment
upon
it
or
to
participate
in
its
development.
the
ruling
on
its
face
relied
solely
upon
statements
in
treatise
writer
for
the
law
of
trust
that
health
per
se
is
charitable.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
well,
when
the
internal
revenue
service
issues
revenue
rulings,
they
give
no
notice
and
opportunity
for
comment.
one
of
the
issues
is
should
this
have
been
a
revenue
ruling?
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
yes.
there
were
three
substantive
violations
which
plaintiffs
charge
from
defendants.
first
and
foremost,
plaintiffs
charge
that
defendants
exceeded
their
statutory
authority
and
in
affect
amended
the
internal
revenue
code
when
they
permitted
hospitals
as
charitable
institutions
to
limit
themselves
to
serving
only
the
paying
public.
if
the
court
decides
this
issue
against
plaintiffs,
then
our
second
issue
is
that
this
indeed,
though
it
was
called
a
revenue
ruling,
which
should
not
have
been
a
revenue
ruling,
it
was
a
substantive
rule
and
defendants
were
required
to
proceed
in
accordance
with
section
553
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the,
a
third
violation,
and
this
again
is
if
the
court
rejects
both
our
internal
revenue
code
and
553
arguments,
is
that
nevertheless
there
was
a
violation
of
section
706
of
the
apa
that
this
ruling
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
the
defendants
would
have
to
have
considered
factors
which
they
did
not
consider
in
the
face
of
the
ruling.
and
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
indicated,
there
are
jurisdictional
issues
which
the
defendants
have
raised.
we
believe
these
jurisdictional
issues
can
be
best
considered
and
understood
in
context
of
the
substantive
issues,
and
for
that
reason
we
will
address
the
substantive
issues
first.
section
501
(c)
(3)
and
170
of
the
internal
revenue
code
has
never
accorded
hospitals
tax-exempt
status
or
deduction
to
the
donors
to
hospitals.
unlike
educational
and
religious
institutions
which
have
their
own
independent
basis,
hospitals
have
had
to
qualify
as
charitable
institutions.
for
decades,
the
irs
has
required
that
these
charitable
hospitals
provide
either
service
exclusively
to
the
poor
or
may
provide
service
to
all
persons
in
the
community,
rich
and
poor
alike,
but
they
may
not
exclude
the
poor.
this
is
the
consistent
position
of
every
tax
court
and
federal
court
that
has
considered
the
issue
in
the
past
thirty-three
years.
there
is
no
case
the
defendants
have
cited
where
a
hospital
has
been
accorded
501
(c)
(3)
status,
without
there
being
a
finding
that
a
hospital
gave
free
service.
this
indeed
is
a
similar
position
that
irs
takes
for
all
other
organizations,
which
are
eligible
for
these
statutory
benefits,
solely
by
virtue
of
being
charitable.
every
ruling
which
is
cited
in
the
defendant’s
brief,
every
ruling
which
is
cited
in
the
amicus
--
american
hospital
association’s
brief,
and
every
ruling
which
we
have
found
and
this
goes
to
date
till
1975,
requires
that
institutions
which
are
solely
charitable
as
distinct
from
being
charitable
and
educational
or
religious
or
societies
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children,
also
must
serve
all
persons
in
the
community
rich
and
poor
alike.
this
is
also
the
position
of
all
state
charitable
cases
or
virtually
all
state
charitable
cases.
the
defendants
relied
simply
on
a
30-year
old
statement
from
scott
on
trust.
in
1939
as
of
1967,
the
scott
treatise
states
that
health
is
charitable
per
se,
but
all
the
cases
that
professor
scott
cites,
the
tax
cases
and
charitable
trust
cases,
also
have
this
rich
and
poor
alike
requirement.
indeed
the
general
law
of
charitable
trust
going
back
to
england
and
more
ancient
times
has
always
considered
that
there
are
four
heads
of
the
charity.
charity
is
either
for
the
relief
of
the
poor,
educational,
religious,
or
there
is
a
fourth
head,
and
this
fourth
head
of
things
beneficial
to
the
community,
but
things
beneficial
to
the
community
must
provide
service
to
all
persons
of
the
community,
again
rich
and
poor
alike.
this
beneficial
to
the
community
does
not
permit
that
the
exclusion
of
the
poor.
the
defendants
argue
that
the
treasury
regulation,
which
issued
in
1959,
permitted
them
to
make
this
change;
that
is
absolutely
untrue.
the
treasury
regulation,
which
issued
in
1959,
is
an
expansion
statement
on
what
is
the
law
on
charitable,
but
it
was
brought
in
to
include
new
purposes
such
as
combating
discrimination,
juvenile
delinquency.
but
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
ruling
of
the
1959
regulation
nor
is
there
anything
in
its
published
history
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
change
and
charitable
organizations
may
serve
only
the
paying
public.
in
1969,
the
american
hospital
association
appealed
to
congress
to
make
a
change
and
give
hospitals
independent
status.
this
change
was
rejected,
it
was
in
the
house
bill.
the
senate
finance
committee
in
october
of
1969,
considered
the
issue
and
the
senate
finance
committee
deleted
the
house
amendment.
the
statement
for
deleting
this
house
amendment
took
into
account
the
fact
that
three
weeks
earlier,
the
internal
revenue
service
had
issued
to
revenue
ruling
that
is
issue
in
this
case.
but
the
senate
finance
committee
stated
flatly
that
they
were
removing
this
provision,
that
the
revenue
ruling
in
issue
in
this
case
did
not
conform
to
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
they
want
to
consider
the
proposal
in
context
that
is
implications
on
health
legislation.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
congress
need
not
conform
the
statute
to
an
administrative
action,
but
administrators
are
bound
to
conform
their
actions
to
a
legislative
enactment.
the
court
below
recognized
the
judicial,
administrative
and
legislative
history
are
discussed,
but
they
went
further.
they
said
that
this
need
not
always
be
the
case,
that
defendants
could
take
into
account
socio-economic
changes.
they
also
made
a
statement,
that
the
so-called
requirement
of
emergency
service
in
the
revenue
ruling,
maybe
of
greater
beneficial
value
to
the
poor
than
general
hospital
services,
including
in-patient
here.
that
--
those
socio-economic
findings
are
legally
infirm.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
revenue
ruling
to
indicate
whatsoever
that
any
of
these
matters
were
taken
into
account
by
defendants.
the
appellate
counsel
in
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
below,
and
in
the
supreme
court,
is
making
this
proffering,
this
argument,
but
that
is
--
should
be
rejected
as
the
court
of
appeal’s
decision
should
be
rejected.
i
think
there
are
many
cases
of
this
court
that
have
stated
flatly,
that
the
post-talk
rationalization
of
appellate
counsel
cannot
substitute
for
the
reason
that
the
administrative
agency
used.
and
the
administrative
agency
used
solely
scott
on
trust,
and
scott
in
trust
has
said
the
same
thing,
i
had
this
one
sentence
upon
which
they
rely
since
1939.
and
in
1939
and
through
the
1940s,
and
through
the
1950s,
and
through
the
1960s,
ye,
in
the
summer
of
1969
internal
revenue
service
was
still
going
at
the
hospitals
that
refused
to
serve
the
poor
and
poor
have
to
be
served.
it
is
also
factually
infirm
because
of
the
limitations
of
time,
i
will
not
go
into
all
the
details.
our
brief
in
chief,
and
the
brief
of
the
american
public
health
association
extensively
discussed
as
why
it
is
factually
infirm.
in
some,
hew,
which
is
the
health
expert
agency
in
this
country
finds
there
are
over
twenty-three
million
people
in
this
country
with
incomes
of
below
the
poverty
guidelines,
and
at
that
time
the
poverty
guidelines
was
something
like
$4,400
a
year
for
a
family
of
four.
that
these
upwards
of
twenty-three
million
people
have
neither
private
not
public
health
insurance,
and
when
we
say
that
we
are
including
medicaid;
medicaid
is
a
very
limited
program
in
terms
of
eligibility
for
income
and
services,
it
does
not
take
care
of
the
poor.
the
health
policy
of
the
united
states
has
continued
to
require
the
free
service
be
given.
the
halliburton
program
of
hew
requires
a
free
service
be
given.
title
xvi
of
the
new
health
planning
act,
december
1974,
congress
specifically
said
that
until
there
is
--
there
will
be
a
national,
or
if
there
will
be
national
health
insurance
program
there
is
still
a
need
to
serve
everyone
of
the
community
to
serve
the
poor.
the
defendants
have
made
a
large
argument
that
this
ruling
does
not
deprive
from
the
service
to
the
poor
that
there
is
an
emergency
room
requirement
in
the
ruling.
we
disagree
in
several
respects.
first,
they
argue
as
if
the
emergency
room
has
now
become
like
a
private
doctor’s
office.
general
physician
services
do
not
exist
in
emergency
room.
the
ruling,
secondly
on
its
face
talks
not
about
general
emergency
room
services,
it
talks
about
a
dire
emergency
and
that
a
hospital
cannot
turn
away
somebody
in
a
dire
emergency.
and
thirdly,
there
is
no
requirement
that
people
not
be
charged.
the
most
they
can
say
for
this
ruling
is
that
people
will
not
be
required
to
put
up
money
upfront
to
pay
a
pre-service
admission
if
they
come
into
an
emergency
room,
they
are
in
a
dire
emergency,
maybe
bleeding
to
death,
there
is
no
free
service
requirement.
turning
now
to
our
section
553
of
the
apa
argument,
which
this
court
need
not
reach
if
they
accept
our
primary
argument.
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
deny
that
it
is
an
agency
subject
to
553
and
it
cannot
make
such
a
denial.
it
says
this
ruling
was
interpretive.
we
say
that
the
internal
revenue
service
is
mislabeling
this
ruling.
this
ruling
on
its
face
has
to
be
substantive.
in
our
principal
brief,
we
have
come
up
with
what
i
would
call
a
functional
test,
that
the
lower
federal
courts
have
increasing
in
recent
areas
looked
behind
the
label
and
have
said,
is
the
rule
a
policy
of
an
agency,
general
long
standing,
is
it
a
revision
of
a
long
standing
rule.
is
there
a
need
for
an
agency
to
expedite
--
to
educate
itself?
what
is
the
impact
upon
an
industry?
what
is
the
impact
upon
the
public?
in
everyone
of
these
cases,
here
is
a
major
revision
done
without
notice,
without
an
opportunity
for
comment
by
an
agency
that
knows
virtually
nothing
about
healthcare,
ignoring
what
the
healthcare
agency
of
united
states
is
doing,
let
alone
what
organizations
like
the
american
public
health
association
would
do.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
well
i
do
not
think,
i
would
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
do
not
know
if
this
court
knows
more
about
it
but
--
and
i
also
do
not
know
if
the
court
of
appeals
might
know
more
about
it,
but
these
on
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
they
made
findings,
they
made
findings
without
a
record.
they
have
reached
out
and
sustained
this
ruling
in
the
same
way
as
if
there
was
an
attack
on
congressional
statute
for
being
unconstitutional.
the
fact
is
this
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
looked
simply
as
to
what
reason
that
was
used
by
the
agency,
scott
on
trust.
if
they
did
not
looked
at
that,
they
have
reached
out
and
made
socio-economic
analysis,
they
were
going
beyond
their
power
and
or
their
--
so,
with
all
this
court
i
think
what
this
argument
has
to
determine
is
that
this
is
the
kind
of
thing,
there
should
have
been
hearing
on.
the
alternatively
if
the
court
finds
--
feels
a
definitial
test
is
the
proper
one,
an
interpretive
rule
is
one
that
is
limited
to
determination
of
congressional
purpose.
a
substantive
rule
is
one
which
augments
congressional
purpose
and
goes
beyond
the
statute,
it
goes
outside
the
statute.
in
this
test
too,
this
is
a
substantive
rule.
i
will
not
go
into
our
alternative
section
706
of
the
apa
argument.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
only
way
the
defendants
feel
that
the
ruling
could
be
sustained
is
they
had
to
make
the
socio-economic
argument.
it
is
not
on
the
rule
--
it
is
not
on
the
face
of
the
rule.
the
agency
did
not
consider
it,
and
therefore,
all
relevant
were
not
conceded
and
as
citizens
to
preserve
over
to
the
park
all
over
again.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
jurisdictional
arguments
that
defendants
have
proffered.
defendants
have
not
come
up
with
what
is
a
variety
of
jurisdictional
barriers
to
plaintiffs
sustaining
--
maintaining
this
cause.
their
first
argument
is
an
attack
upon
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
in
abbot
laboratories
and
all
other
cases
like
it.
it
is
an
attack
upon
the
presumptive
reviewability
of
agency
action.
i
do
not
think
that
the
irs
intended
to
attack
that
for
any
other
agency
of
government,
but
itself.
it
says
it
is
somehow
different,
but
it
has
proffered
no
justification
for
making
the
internal
revenue
service
different
from
any
other
governmental
agency.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
yes,
and
i
will
--
if
you
like
i
will
turn
to
warth
v.
seldin
now,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
warth
v.
seldin
of
course
raises
the
question
of
standing
to
sue.
plaintiffs
are
poor
people
who
were
denied
healthcare,
denied
admission
to
hospitals
by
hospitals,
which
have
been
given
501
(c)
(3)
status.
and
(voice
overlap)
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
disagree.
in
warth
v.
seldin,
in
this
court
found
that
the
defendants
there
were
not
responsible
for
the
inability
of
those
people
to
find
housing
in
penfield,
it
was
the
marketplace
that
was
at
fault.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
federal
statute,
the
charitable
provision
of
the
code,
which
is
intended
by
congress
to
meliorate
the
conditions
of
the
marketplace,
and
what
plaintiffs
have
said
is,
government
you
have
aggravated
our
rights
under
that
statute,
it
is
very
different.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
oh!
yes,
absolutely.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
i
think
the
whole
history
of
the
reason
for
the
charitable
provision
of
the
code,
just
as
the
charity
in
the
charitable
trust
--
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
in
fact,
the
defendants
in
their
treasury
regulation,
when
they
start
off
to
finding
what
is
charitable,
they
say
principally
for
the
relief
of
the
poor.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
from
this
court,
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
from
this
court,
there
are
lower
courts
--
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
yes,
the
whole
--
in
1930s
there
is
a
house
report
on
the
reason
for
the
charitable
provisions
of
the
code,
it
is
to
lessen
the
burdens
of
government.
this
is
a
classic
statement.
it
goes
back
to
the
charitable
law
of
charitable
trust
where
the
reason,
it
goes
back
1601,
that
charitable
trust
started
was
to
take
care
of
certain
things
for
that
the
government,
otherwise
it
will
be
obligated
to
do
and
the
hear
of
the
poor
was
always
the
primary
consideration.
i
think
our
plaintiffs
are
clearly
within
the
zone
of
interest.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
well,
if,
truly
--
well,
your
honor,
if
the
--

well,

we

ms.
marilyn
g.

well,
let
me
turn
this
around
--
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
we
presume
that
when
the
--
all
through
the
years
the
internal
revenue
service
required
service
to
the
poor
and
hospitals
would
deem
to
be
charitable,
that
they
were
obeying
the
law,
the
entire
internal
revenue
code
--

if
they
wanted
to
be
tax
--
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
if
hospitals
wanted
to
lose
their
tax
exemption,
but
--
but
that
is
mere
--
that
is
a
great
degree
of
speculation.
there
were
thirty
--
there
are
thirty-five
hundred
hospitals
--
ms.
marilyn

mr.
justice
white,
hospitals
are
tax-exempt,
they
not
--
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
well,
your
honor,
may
i
state
several
different
responses
to
that.
first,
they
would
not
only
lose
the
power
of
how
it
be
tax-exempt,
but
they
would
lose
the
contributions
to
them,
and
60%
of
the
construction
money
going
into
hospitals
today
is
from
charitable
donations.
the
american
hospital
association
goes
up
to
the
hill,
they
make
the
statement.
it
is
in
--
the
appendix,
the
speech
of
the
testimony
of
the
american
hospital
association
that
charitable
contributions
to
hospitals
are
what
keeps
hospitals
going.
it
makes
the
marginal
difference.
further,
as
amicus
of
jackson
county,
missouri,
has
pointed
out
in
its
brief
that
states
follow
what
the
federal
government
does.
and
if
a
hospital
decided
it
would
rather
not
serve
the
poor,
it
could
not
be
--
it
would
lose
its
tax-exemption,
it
would
be
paying
thousands
--
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
taxes
every
year
on
the
property
on
which
it
sits.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
okay,
okay.
the
standing
and
basically
is
--
the
proposition
is
that
poor,
and
i
think
in
way,
i
have
probably
answered
most
of
the
standing
argument.
we
think
warth
v.
seldin
is
not
pertinent.
we
think
because
this
particular
provision
was
designed
to
meliorate
the
conditions
of
the
poor
and
it
is
the
obligation
of
that
statute
that
hospitals
are
not
about
to
give
up
their
tax-exempt
status.
and
three,
the
other,
the
last
argument
the
government
raised,
well,
i
think
they
raised
at
first
is
this
is
prosecutorial
and
this
is
not
prosecutorial,
we
are
not
seeking
the
prosecution
of
anybody.
we
are
seeking
a
revocation
of
a
ruling
and
the
order
of
the
district
court
with
which
we
would
like
reinstated
is
that
this
ruling
was
invalid,
hospitals
have
to
give
free
service
and
that
the
notification
be
made
to
the
public.
the
internal
revenue
service
publishes
its
cumulative
bulletin,
and
if
hospitals
in
the
future
did
not
want
to
give
free
service,
they
could
elect
to
be
pulled-off
that
list,
but
until
they
are
pulled-off
the
list,
the
public
relies
--
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
we
--
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
declaratory
judgment
provision
are
not
pertinent.
this
is
not
a
case
involving
the
assessment
of
collection
of
taxes
of
either
the
poor
people
themselves
or
of
anybody
else.
there
is
no
other
alternative
for
these
people.
it
is
not
a
refund
suit.
this
is
not
like
americans,
united
trying
to
protect
their
contributors.
this
has
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
assessment.
and
sovereign
immunity,
we
believe
has
long
been
overruled
in
most
respects,
the
government
is
arguing
it
that
under
larson,
this
case
is
one
exceeding
statutory
authority
and
this
is
clearly
what
the
case
is
about.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
no
we
have
the
alternatives,
if
you
dwell
on
larson,
if
you
find
for
some
reason
that
the
larson
does
not
apply
them
we
are
relying
on
scamwel
(ph)
--
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
no,
the,
it
is
the
court
below,
but
basically
we
are
saying
that
for
cases
that
are
apa
cases,
sovereign
immunity
no
longer
exists.
this
does
not
mean
there
is
not
a
sovereign
immunity
argument
on
property
cases,
damage
cases,
property
held
in
the
name
of
the
united
states,
there
is
a
still
sovereign
immunity
argument,
it
just
does
not
exist
anymore,
or
abbott
laboratories,
parlow
(ph),
collins,
and
data
processing
are
all
overruled.
i
think
will
save,
thank
you.
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
my
time
is
up?
ms.
marilyn
g.
rose
may
i
make
one
statement
of
fact.
there
are
over
twelve-thousand
lawsuits
that
are
brought
every
year
involving
revenue
rulings
by
--
on
refund
and
deficiency
situations,
and
that
is
where
uncertainty
may
lay
if
there
is
uncertainty.
the
half
a
dozen
suits
in
five
years
do
not
brace
uncertainty.
