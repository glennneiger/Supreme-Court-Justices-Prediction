mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
simply
is
that
published
revenue
rulings,
such
as
the
revenue
ruling
at
issue
here,
do
not
present
any
issue
for
a
federal
court
to
review
and
in
that
holding
to
the
contrary
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
erroneous.
and
before
discussing
in
detail,
the
various
jurisdictional
barriers
that
we
think
exist
in
this
suit,
i
think
it
would
be
important
for
the
court
to
have
before
it
what
the
essential
nature
of
a
revenue
ruling
is.
because
in
our
view
that
essential
nature
demonstrates
that
the
jurisdictional
holding
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
this
case
would
require
the
federal
courts
to
render
judgments
in
the
most
abstract
contexts.
now,
each
year
the
internal
revenue
service,
pursuant
to
its
statutory
authority
under
section
7805
of
the
code,
issues
some
forty-thousand
advanced
letter
rulings.
these
advanced
letter
rulings
set
forth
its
opinion
of
the
federal
tax
consequences
of
specific
proposed
transactions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
those
are
private.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
few
of
those
are
later
published
anonymously.
and
of
those
forty-thousand
the
service
selects
and
edits
several
hundred
for
publication
in
its
internal
revenue
bulletin,
in
a
more
abstract
and
anonymous
form.
now,
the
introduction
to
the
internal
revenue
bulletin
on
the
first
page
has
long
stated
that
such
rulings
do
not
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
but
are
informational
in
character
only
and
represent
the
conclusion
of
the
service
as
the
application
of
the
tax
law
to
what
is
often
an
abbreviated
set
of
facts.
now,
this
court
in
the
dixon
case
and
many
other
cases
has
underscored
and
ratified
that
statement
in
a
cumulative
bulletin
that
these
rulings
are
simply
guidelines
for
irs
personnel
and
to
educate
the
public
general,
and
it
had
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
every
two
weeks
the
internal
revenue
service
i
think
publishes
a,
something
called
the
internal
revenue
bulletin,
and
then
every
six
months
or
so
those
are
bound
in
what
is
known
a
cumulative
bulletin,
and
those
are
distributed
to
people,
officers
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
people
generally
who
are
interested
in
the
development
of
the
tax
law.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
private
tax
lawyers
can
subscribe,
exactly
and
indeed
anyone
can
subscribe
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
now,
these
rulings
contribute
to
have
a
salutary
aim.
they
contribute
to
uniformity
of
interpretation
because
as
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware,
it
would
be
unfortunate
of
it
two
revenue
agents
in
different
districts
were
to
apply
the
tax
lax
law
according
to
their
best
likes
but
coming
out
with
a
different
results
on
what
is
an
identical
set
of
facts.
so
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
we
try
our
best,
the
internal
revenue
service
tries
its
best,
but
often
mistakes
are
made.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
and
that
these
internal
--
-this
revenue
rulings
are
an
attempt
to
mitigate
and
minimize
those
unfortunate
instances.
in
any
event,
these
revenue
rulings,
these
contribute
to
uniformity
of
interpretation
and
in
our
view
contribute
to
the
stability
of
the
tax
law
by
reducing
controversies
between
the
internal
revenue
service
and
taxpayers
because
as
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware,
taxpayers,
many
taxpayers
do
not
like
to
litigate
with
the
internal
revenue
service.
they
would
prefer
to
have
an
advance
notice
of
what
its
position
might
be
on
a
particular
set
of
facts,
and
this
educational
program
increases
stability
and
reduces
litigation
and
the
intended
burdens
on
the
federal
courts.
now,
the
format
of
the
ruling,
of
a
revenue
ruling
is
essentially
a
statement
of
facts
and
it
is
often
abbreviated
with
a
brief
conclusion
as
to
what
the
federal
tax
consequences
of
those
facts
are.
and
the
important
thing
is
that
the
internal
revenue
service
does
abbreviate
a
revenue
--
the
facts
in
publishing
a
revenue
ruling,
because
when
a
taxpayer
makes
a
submission
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
he
makes
a
submission
with
a
voluminous
statement
of
facts.
but
the
internal
revenue
service
when
it
--
if
it
may
select
this
particular
letter
ruling
for
publication,
it
will
boil
this
down
and
essentially
present
the
statement
of
facts
which
is
designed
to
illustrate
a
particular
legal
principle
that
it
feels
as
of
general
interest.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
so,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
courts,
of
course
this
get
into
the
argument
about
notice
and
hearing
requirements,
but
they
are
not
binding
on
the
courts.
in
fact
there
are
scores
of
cases
which
hold
that
it
is
simply
a
statement
of
what
the
internal
revenue
service
thinks
the
law
is.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh!
absolutely,
that
is
a
higher
from
of
tax
life,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
that
is
revenue
ruling
69-545.
now,
this
ruling
itself
demonstrates
the
hypothetical
quality
of
what
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
--
or
hypothetical
quality
of
the
relief
they
are
seeking,
because
as
the
court
can
readily
see
in
perusing
this
revenue
ruling,
it
sets
forth
two
polar
situations,
situation
one
and
situation
two
dealing
with
two
hospitals,
hospital
(a)
and
hospital
(b).
hospital
(a)
there
are
variety
of
facts
in
connection
with
--
hospital
(a)
has
an
open
board
of
trustees.
it
gives
open
staff
privileges.
it
is
involved
in
research
and
educational
activities.
it
maintains
a
full-time
emergency
room
and
no
one
requiring
emergency
care
is
denied
treatment.
to
the
contrary,
hospital
(b)
is
almost
proprietary
in
nature.
it
is
owned
by
a
small
group
of
doctors.
they
limit
the
staff
of
privileges
to
people
they
know
and
they
comprise
the
medical
committee
generally
to
keep
out
qualified
physicians,
so
etcetera-etcetera
and
it
does
not
have
--
it
maintains
an
emergency
room,
but
basically
to
treat
the
patients
of
its
own
doctors.
now,
these
two
polar
examples
were
designed
to
educate
the
public
generally
and
hospital
administrators
as
to
clear-cut
situations.
hospital
(a)
is
a
situation,
if
you
like
hospital
(a),
you
will
be
--
you
will
be
fairly
certain
of
exemption,
but
of
course
the
ruling
does
conclude
that
you
cannot
be
certain
of
that
itself.
you
have
got
to
yourself
submit
an
application
for
exemption
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
if
you
like
hospital
(b),
which
is
a
polar
example
of
hospital
that
does
not
seem
to
provide
any
community
benefits.
it
seems
to
be
run
pretty
much
strictly
for
the
private
inurnment
of
its
owner-doctors.
in
those
situation
--
in
that
situation
you
are
not
going
to
get
a
tax
exempt
status.
now,
the
important
thing,
which
we
emphasize,
is
that
the
ruling
does
not
even
begin
to
attempt
to
deal
with
the
hundreds
of
gradations
in
between
hospital
(a)
and
hospital
(b).
hospital
(a)
assuming
for
a
moment
that
--
that
it
does
not
treat
people
--
that
does
not
give
free
care
to
the
indigents
on
a
broad
scale,
although
let
us
say
it
dropped
its
emergency
room
requirement
--
emergency
room
completely
for
let
us
say
the
particular
example
that
it
may
be
engaged
in
treating
cancer
patients
or
a
particular
kind
of
decease.
under
those
circumstances
an
emergency
room
would
be
relatively
--
would
be
superfluous
because
such
a
hospital
would
rarely
have
need
for
an
emergency
room
or
for
example
a
consortium
of
hospitals
in
a
particularly
community
could
get
together
and
one
could
say,
we
will
have
the
emergency
room,
you
have
the
nursing
school,
and
the
third
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
was
a
substantial
event,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
do
not
--
i
am
not
sure
that
is
right,
because
although
the
plaintiffs
cite
many
cases
for
the
preposition
that
the
pre-care
requirement
was
an
absolute
requirement,
there
is
no
reported
decision
and
i
have
found
one
and
there
is
no
instance
that
i
know
about
the
internal
revenue
service
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
even
assuming
that
was
the
case,
that
there
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
now,
it
seems
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
--
it
was
the
understanding
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
although
quite
frankly,
i
think
if
the
decisions
that
the
plaintiffs
cite
of
the
court
of
appeals
indicate
that
there
really
is,
there
was
no
instance
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
revoked
the
tax
exemption
of
a
hospital
solely
because
they
denied
free
care
to
the
indigent.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right,
the
deductibility
of
contributions,
or
the
state
tax
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
yes,
they
do.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
now,
given
the
fact
that
this
ruling
that
is
under
challenge
here
just
presents
these
two
hypothetical
polar
examples,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
that
if
a
particular
hospital
decided
that
it
did
not
need
an
emergency
room
for
a
particular
--
for
particular
reason
because
of
its
own
mode
of
operation,
it
would
not
necessarily
have
been
denied
of
tax
exemption
by
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
that
to
us
demonstrates
the
hypothetical
quality
of
this
suit
because
this
ruling
came
up,
or
was
published
on
an
abbreviated
set
of
facts.
hospital
(a)
indeed
no
other
hospital
is
before
this
court
to
present
its
own
set
of
facts,
and
indeed
each
hospital
continues
to
remain
free
to
litigate
its
own
right
through
exemption
on
its
own
facts.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
hospitals
were
parties
to
this
action
at
all,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
to
us
this
demonstrates
an
important
point
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
we
do
not
regard
the
hospital
as
an
indispensable
party
within
the
technical
meaning
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
simply
because
--
well,
i
do
not
think
--
i
think
that
if
a
hospital
had
been
joined
as
a
party,
then
i
think
we
would
essentially
be
faced
here
with
whether
a
particular
--
that
particular
hospital’s
exemption
should
be
--
should
continue
to
stand
on.
i
think
the
important
thing--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
only
person
that
might
get
hurt
--
the
only
entity
that
might
get
hurt
is
the
hospital
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
makes
them
an
indispensable
--
it
makes
them
an
indispensable
party,
but
the
jointer
of
one,
two,
three
or
indeed
a
dozen
hospitals
would
not
--
would
not
solve
the
tag
--
would
not
create
a
broad
rule,
which
would
be
applicable
to
the
hospitals
generally
because
each
hospital
continues
to
remain
free
to
litigate
its
own
right
to
an
exemption
on
its
own
particular
facts.
and
to
us
that
demonstrates
that
this
suit
really
is
tantamount
to
asking
a
federal
court
to
render
an
advisory
opinion,
because
if
federal
court
says
the
emergency
room
requirement
is
no
good,
reinstate
the
old
ruling,
what
would
left
--
what
essentially
you
are
left
with
is
a
pronouncement
which
has
no
pertinence
to
any
particular
hospital
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
essentially,
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
a
concrete
case,
which
wants
a
decision
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
did
you
say?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
filed
the
motion,
essentially
the
position
that
we
advance
here
was
advanced
in
the
lower
courts,
we
moved
to
dismiss
for
a
lack
of
standing,
for
because
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
state
cause
of
action
for
that
this
suit
comes
within
tax
exemption
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
that
is
not
appropriate
for
judicial
resolution.
essentially
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
and
the
district
court
denied
the
motions
to
--
the
motion
to
dismiss
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
and
the
district
court
--
essentially
the
district
court
decided
that
it
had
jurisdiction,
held
the
ruling
invalid,
and
granted
broad
--
you
know
the
broad
declaratory
relief
that
the
plaintiffs
seek.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction,
but
held
the
ruling
to
be
valid.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
may
had
have
financial
consequences
to
some
hospitals,
but
it
is
entirely
unclear
as
to
how
many.
if
any
hospitals
would
have
--
would
have
had
--
would
have
been
--
would
have
suffered
detriment.
the
point
is
that
each
hospital
continues
to
remain
free
to
litigate
its
own,
its
own
right
to
a
tax
exemption.
indeed
in
hospital
(a)
in
this
case,
as
the
ruling
demonstrates,
was
involved
in
education
and
research
activities.
it
may
well
be
that
if
it
decided
to
drop
its
emergency
room,
as
i
have
said
for
one
reason
or
another
for
because
it
was
inappropriate
to
its
activities,
it
still
would
have
a
right
to
an
exemption
and
it
could
have
pressed
its
case
before
the
commissioner
and
before
a
federal
court,
either
the
tax
court
or
a
district
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
and
that
to
us
demonstrates,
you
know,
the
hypothetical
and
abstract
quality
of
this
suit.
it
does
not
attempt
to
solve
anything
of
general
import,
and
a
revenue
ruling
does
not
attempt
to
solve
anything
of
general
import.
it
simply
a
published
statement
on
abbreviated
facts
of
the
internal
revenue
service,
boiled
down
which
attempts
to
educate
the
public
about
general
internal
revenue
service
positions.
now,
i
think
the
point
about
joining
every
hospital
in
the
country
is
important
because
essentially
congress
has
the
determined
that
the
tax
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
is
limited
to
deficiency
suits
and
refund
suits.
and
the
reason
for
that
essentially,
is
because
the
court’s
cannot
decide
cases,
much
less
tax
cases,
on
anything
but
a
full
presentation
of
all
the
facts.
here
we
have
an
abbreviated
set
of
facts,
and
essentially
for
a
court
to
render
judgment
about
hospital
(a)
and
other
similarly
situated
hospitals
may
not
in
fact
very
many
if
any
hospitals
at
all.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
this
letter
is
declared
out,
it
change
--
i
do
not
--
it
change,
it
seems
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
not
change
a
tax
liability
of
any
hospital.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly,
this
is
really
an,
you
know,
a
request
for
an
abstract
decision
on
an
abstract
set
of
facts.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
my
answer
would
not
be
different,
simply
because
as
we
have
point
out
at
great
length
in
our
brief,
we
do
not
think
that
third
parties
--
we
do
not
think
that
the
internal
revenue
code
confers
a
private
right
of
action
on
non-taxpayers
to
contest
the
tax
liability
of
any
particular
--
of
any
particular
person.
and
i
think
that
is
important
here
because
i
think
essentially
that
is
what
--
that
is
what
is
lurking
behind
this
suit.
the
plaintiffs
have
said
that
this
suit
essentially,
simply
involves
the
editing
and
the
rewriting
of
a
revenue
ruling
of
general
application
and
they
trust
the
system
to
alter
hospital
conduct.
now,
we
--
taking
that
at
face
value
i
think
that
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
really
makes
this
an
abstract
case.
simple
because
of
the
internal
--
if
they
are
not
interested
in
internal
revenue
enforcement,
with
respect
to
any
particular
hospital
or
group
of
hospitals,
then
essentially
they
are
asking
the
federal
courts
to
rewrite
revenue
rulings
which
are
the
province
--
which
is
the
province
of
the
commissioner
where
there
may
be
no
effect
at
all,
or
they
proffer
interest
in
that
effect.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
not
let
--
that
is
right,
we
do
not
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
anymore
than
(a)
cannot
litigate
the
propriety
of
a
ruling
given
to
(b)
if
he
does
like
(b)
if
he
thinks
(b)
is
a
competitor
of
his,
if
he
thinks
that
for
one
abstract
reason
or
another
that
the
ruling
was
incorrect.
the
internal
revenue
simply
does
not
confer
private
rights
of
action
on
citizens
generally
to
challenge
the
packs
consequences
that
the
internal
revenue
service
conferred
on
a
private
party.
i
think
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
absolutely
well
settled.
i
think
that
the
court
if
there
is
a
decision,
which
is
in
point
on
this
--
of
this
court,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
louisiana
versus
mcadoo,
which
the
plaintiffs
here
had
dismissed
as
overruled.
that
decision
has
not
been
overruled,
there
the
state
of
louisiana,
which
was
itself
engaged
in
the
production
of
sugar,
brought
a
suit
against
the
--
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
in
this
court
in
an
original
action
to
force
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
increase
the
quotas,
the
duties
on
imported
sugar.
it
as
a
producer
of
domestic
sugar
felt
pampered
and
fina
--
that
--
that,
those
rulings
were
operated
to
its
financial
determent,
and
the
court
simply
said
that
that
kind
of
action,
it
dismissed
it
without
considering
the
merits,
would
operate
and
disturb
the
whole
revenue
system
of
the
government,
and
that
the
court’s
role
in
such
a
case
would
be
to
interfere
with
the
very
function
of
government.
and
if
another
decision
which
we
think
is
virtually
on
point
is
the
dorsheimer
case
which
was
rendered
by
this
court
over
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
answer
is
yes,
but
the
--
but
that
has
been
a
decision
of
congress
to
confer
this,
the
power
to
administer
the
tax
laws
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
and
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
simple
letter
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
i
have
found
by
member
of
congress
elicited
a
very
prompt
response.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely,
and
they
can
enact
legislation.
and
if
particular
public
officials
have
acted
in
a
way
that
the
congress
thinks
is
improper,
the
congress
can
seek
to
call
in
before
investigating
committees,
indeed
you
know
recent
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
do
that,
in
fact
the
present
incumbent
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
been
before
congress
some
twenty-nine
times
in
the
last
year.
congress
has
exhibited
a
very
detailed
interest
in
both
substantive
tax
law
and
in
the
administration
of
the
revenue
laws.
it
seems
to
us
there
was
just
some
things
that
the
courts
do
not
get
into,
and
one
of
them
is
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws
as
the
commissioner
sees
fit.
this
to
us
dates
back
to
the
second
congress
when
--
when
in
1792,
congress
enacted
a
provision
saying
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shall
enact,
shall
direct
the
collection
of
taxes,
which
were
then
internal
taxes,
as
he
shall
judge
best.
and
that
the
present
code
follows
through
on
that,
grants
a
number
wide
discretionary
powers
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
his
delegate,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
to
publish
rules,
make
assessments,
bring
civil
actions
and
those
--
that
authority
is
explicitly
and
solely
conferred
in
these
public
officials.
the
internal
revenue
code
does
not
confer
any
private
rights
of
action
in
those
--
in
those
cases.
and
indeed,
as
i
was
saying,
the
dorsheimer
case,
it
seems
to
us
is
another
case,
which
a
hundred
years
ago
this
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
a
collector
of
the
internal
revenue
and
they
--
and
two
informants
brought
a
suit
against
the
united
states
urging
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
improperly
waived
the
penalty
in
a
particular
liquor
tax
violation
case.
and
they
were
indeed
hurt
because
at
that
time,
they
had
it
then,
they
had
an
existing
right
to
a
--
to
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
proceeds
of
the
penalty.
they
felt
that
they
should
--
that
penalty
should
have
been
enforced
and
they
would
have
gotten
more
money
and
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
very
hard
to
know
how
that
case
went
off.
the
court
simply
said
with
respect
to
the
digression
of
the
commission
--
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
it
was
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
in
matter
and
trusted
to
him
alone,
and
from
which
there
could
be
no
appeal.
i
suppose
the
court
said
that
there
really
was
not
the
case
for
the
court
to
consider.
this
was
something
that
congress
had
given
this
public
official
sole
discretion
to
do
and
you
cannot
appeal
from
that
sort
of
thing.
and
today
and
indeed
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
for
discretion
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
settle
cases.
if
a
case
is
settled
and
some
third
party
does
not
like
the
way
it
was
settled,
there
is
no
course
of
action
to
come
into
the
federal
courts
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
exactly.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
these
particular
public
officials,
they
may
make
mistakes
from
time
to
time,
but
the
presumption
is
that
they
are
upgrading
sincerely
in
accordance
with
their
best
likes.
the
tax
law
is
hard,
but
the
internal
revenue
service
is
staffed
by
people
who
have
a
good
deal
of
expertise
in
this
matter
and
the
courts
are
not
going
to
second
guess
them
in
this
context.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
course.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
the
internal
revenue
service
reserves
the
right
to
revoke
something
retroactively
and
it
generally
only
does
it
when
there
is
an
omission
of
the
material
fact,
but
he
can
do
in
this
court
and
dixon
and
american
automobile
association
has
said
that
he
can
do
it.
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
brings
up
another
point
about
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
can
be
tested
in
the
charitable
--
yes,
as
the
court
have
indicated
in
bob
jones.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
of
course
the
public
has
a
right
to
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
commissioner.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely,
in
the
same
way
that
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
if
somebody
feels
somebody
is
involved
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
contacts
the
general
counsel
of
the
labor
board
and
he
disagrees,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter.
you
cannot
sue
to
compel
the
general
counsel
of
the
labor
board
or
the
federal
trade
commission
or
may
other
agencies
and
ask
them
to
commence
proceedings
against
private
parties.
congress
has
vested
discretion
in
these
officials
alone
to
enforce
those
statutes.
i
want
to
mention
one
other
thing,
and
sort
of
as
a
concomitant
to
what
my
discussion
with
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
that
is
these
injunction
--
the
--
the
difficulties
engendered
by
this
kind
of
injunctive
actions
could
sue
in
this
case
are
illustrated
by
what
happened
after
the
district
court’s
judgment
came
down.
the
district
court
voided
the
revenue
ruling
and
enjoined
the
commissioner
from
taking
any
action
consistent
with
it
then
of
course
the
government
appealed.
of
course,
during
that
--
of
course
during
that
time,
too
many
hospitals
were
anxious
to
have
their
tax
status
clarified.
contributors
who
are
anxious
to
have
their
deductions
clarified.
municipal
bond
issues
were
pending
as
to
whether
exempt
--
hospitals
were
tax
exempt.
the
government
applied
for
a
stay
to
the
district
court
of
its
decision
in
order
to
allow
at
least
until
the
matter
was
resolved
throughout
the
courts
to
have
its
policy
continued
to
be
extent.
the
district
court
denied
the
stay,
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
stay.
essentially
for
six
or
eight
months
the
matter
was
in
complete
limbo.
the
commissioner
had
no
idea
how
to
enforce
the
law
at
all
and
it
seems
to
us
that
really
demonstrates
how
these
injunctive
actions
undermine
the
whole
very
salutary
nature
of
the
revenue
--
published
revenue
ruling
program
which
is
to
educate
the
public
and
if
the
public
is
in
disarray,
does
not
know
what
the
answer
is
going
to
be,
and
the
commissioner
is
time
being
by
court
orders
in
a
normal
case
where
a
ruling
is
once
--
if
let
us
say
a
ruling
is
approved
by
a
district
court
as
it
was
ultimately
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
let
us
say
for
one
reason
or
the
another
the
commissioner
wants
to
modify
it
as
he
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
so
simply
because
he
has
--
you
know
the
internal
revenue
district
office
is
there,
so
i
would
think
that
he
could
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
is
probably
right
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
yes,
bob
jones
came
up
through
the
district
courts,
yes.
right,
the
point
i
was
--
the
final
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
was
essentially
if
a
ruling
were
approved
and
the
commissioner
wanted
to
modify
it
in
some
way,
presumably
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
that
approved
it
by
an
injunctive
order
to
get
permission
to
modify
it
otherwise
he
would
be
in
contempt
to
that
court
order.
the
tax
law
simply
cannot
be
administered
that
way,
we
submit,
and
[laughter]
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
reasons
we
have
set
forth
probably
at
two
greater
length
than
our
brief
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
an
entry
of
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
