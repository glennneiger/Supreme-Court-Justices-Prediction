justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
would
that
be
in
existent
or
without
the
letter
from
the
revenue
service,
would
these
hospitals
have
served
the
poor?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
hospitalâ€™s
exemption
have
been
revoked
for
failing
to
serve
the
poor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
that
have
helped
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
saying
--
you
are
saying
that
the
modification
of
the
rule
permits
the
exemption
despite
the
failure
to
serve
charities?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
these
hospitals
have
not
served
charities,
they
are,
under
the
prior
rule,
their
letters
would
have
been
revoked?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
not
required
to
do
it?
they
were
not
required
under
the
law
to
do
it?
it
is
just
if
they
wanted
to
be
a
tax
exempt,
they
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
not
break
any
law
if
they
did
not
serve
the
poor?
justice
byron
r.
white
upon
whose
side
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
days
when
the
profit
and
loss
statements
of
hospitals
looks
like
different
than
they
used
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
thought
you
ought
to
be
making
the
standing
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
smith,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
issuance
of
this
revenue
ruling,
it
was
not
a
rather
substantial
event?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
day
before
the
law
was
not
that
hospital
like
that.
hospital
in
type
(a)
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
the
case
is
though,
even
assuming
that
that
was
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
revenue
service
at
the
moment
it
issued
that
ruling
was
then
applying
the
revenue
laws
completely
different
than
it
had
before.
now,
you
are
arguing
the
case
on
that
basis,
are
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
is
it
is
not
a
case
of
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
state
has
cause
of
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
filed
motions
to
dismiss,
basically?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
filed
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
let
them
into
any
suit
at
anything
with
respect
to
whether
a
hospital
was
exempt
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
this
particular
group
or
poor
people
generally
who
would
like
free
service
cannot
litigate,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned,
the
exemption
or
non-exemption
of
hospitals?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
anybody,
can
any
person
that
you
know
of
challenge
the,
an
exemption
letter?
i
am
sure
if
you
cancel
one,
the
fellow
who
letter
has
canceled
can
litigate
with
you,
but
how
about
the
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
you
want
to
grant
an
exemption
letter,
whether
it
conforms
to
the
statute
or
not
you
are
home
free?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
yes
or
no,
is
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
instead
audit
somebody
and
allow
the
depreciation
deduction
and
nobody
can
really
challenge
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
not
came
out
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
say
that
again
[laughter]
