j.
brennan,
jr.
but
supposed
the
gun
was
stamped
“manufacturing
company,”
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
had
been
manufactured
in
connecticut?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
reich,
the
ruling
in
title
iv
with
which
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
is
precisely
the
words
in
(inaudible)
that
were
entitled
for
when
tot
was
decided,
is
that
not
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
certainly,
the
court
in
tot
apparently
with
the
agreement
of
the
government
has
said
reciting
what
had
happened
in
lower
courts,
both
courts,
it
held
that
the
offense
created
by
the
act
is
confined
to
receipt
of
the
firearms
or
ammunitions
as
a
part
of
interstate
transportation
does
not
extend
to
the
receipt
which
is
your
argument
here
in
an
interstate
transaction,
of
such
articles
which
had
some
prior
time
have
been
transported
into
the
state,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
should
we
do
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
congress
was
not
aware
of
or
ignored?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
most
apparently,
your
predecessors
in
the
solicitor
general’s
office
did.
it
was
calling
in
the
court
in
that
opinion,
i
was
not
here
then.
it
says
that
the
government
agrees
that
this
construction
is
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
put
your
hand
here
that
those
words
do
not
to
reach
what
we
now
heard
and
furthermore,
in
both
courts,
the
fact
that
you
have
two
courts
of
appeals,
both
courts
below
held
exactly
what
it
said,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
that
congress
would
have
been
aware
of
two
courts
of
appeals,
the
language
is
not
plus
the
opinions
of
the
chief
law
enforcement
agency
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
know
that
congress
is
not
aware
of
a
lot
of
things
that
happen
around
here,
that
is
quite
obvious?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
usually
the
way
we
treat
these
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
know,
but
do
we
not
presume
that
congress
keeps
itself
familiar
with
what
things
that
we
say
around
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
an
issue
of
statutory
construction,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
frequently
do
we
review
which
is
the
statutory
construction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
(inaudible)
boys
market,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
often
outside
the
situations
like
boys
market
have
we
ever
done
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
name
of
that?
