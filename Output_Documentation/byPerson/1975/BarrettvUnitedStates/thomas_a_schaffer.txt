mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
thomas
a.
schaffer.
i
am
from
cincinnati,
ohio
and
i
am
the
attorney
for
petitioner,
mr.
pearl
barrett
in
his
action.
the
question
that
is
presented
before
the
court
this
morning
is
a
simple
one
and
a
single
one
and
it
involves
whether
or
not
title
xviii
of
the
united
states
code,
section
922
(h)
applies
to
the
petitioner,
mr.
barrett
who
purchased
a
firearm
in
a
purely
intrastate
transaction
and
was
not
himself
personally
involved
in
any
manner
with
the
intrastate
transportation
of
that
weapon.
the
facts
are
basically
undisputed
and
they
are
as
follows.
on
the
april
1,
1972,
mr.
barrett
purchased
a
smith
&
wesson
32-caliber
pistol
from
one
larry
d.
bates,
the
owner
and
operator
of
the
western
auto
store
in
louisville,
kentucky.
petitioner
later
that
day
was
stopped
for
a
traffic
offense
in
a
leslie
county,
kentucky,
the
surrounding
county.
the
police
at
the
time
they
apprehended
mr.
barrett
searched
his
vehicle
and
discovered
the
weapon
lying
on
the
floor
on
a
passenger
side.
some
time
prior
to
this
occurrence,
mr.
barrett
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
of
housebreaking
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
so
he
was
a
convicted
felon
as
described
by
section
922
(h)
and
as
that
section
prohibits,
he
was
allegedly
forbidden
to
possess
that
weapon
being
under
the
disability
of
a
prior
felony.
he
was
subsequently
charged
under
section
922
(h)
and
he
was
tried
in
unites
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
at
jackson,
was
convicted
on
may
24,
1973.
he
then
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
sitting
in
cincinnati,
ohio
and
that
court
affirmed
the
conviction
on
october
18,
1974.
the
government
at
page
27
of
their
brief
in
referring
to
the
differences
between
the
statute
that
we
have
here
today
which
is
922
(h)
part
of
title
iv
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
and
title
vii
which
was
passed
subsequent
to
title
iv
state
in
their
brief
“that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
to
produce
this
topsy-turvy
result
when
it
enacted
these
related
provisions
as
different
titles
of
the
same
act.”
petitioner
contends
today
that
indeed
congress
did
intend
to
produce
different
results
with
title
iv
and
title
vii.
title
iv
or
section
922
(h),
that
section
with
which
we
are
concerned
today
covers
in
part
the
receiving
of
any
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
intrastate
or
foreign
commerce.
while
title
vii
which
was
passed
subsequent
to
title
iv
states
that
it
is
prohibited
to
receive,
possess,
or
transport
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
any
firearm.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
note
the
difference
in
position
of
the
word
“firearm”
in
those
phrases.
we
feel
that
this
is
an
important
distinction
between
the
acts
and
as
we
go
farther
into
the
argument
and
bring
out
the
legislative
history,
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
recognize
that
congress
in
placing
that
word
behind
the
modifying
words
is
the
difference
in
the
statutes
and
it
is
this
difference
that
we
feel
controls
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
no
sir,
that
is
not
our
contention
at
all.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
your
honor,
that
is
not
part
of
my
argument,
but
i
contend
that
that
is
most
likely
what
title
vii
of
the
gun
control
act
has
done.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
would
say
that
congress
has
certain
limitations
as
case
history
is
developed,
but
in
this
instance,
if
a
gun
can
be
determined
to
have
affected
commerce
as
the
cases
have
reported
in
the
title
vii
situations,
i
feel
that
that
congress
does
have
that
power.
but
we
do
not
have
that
question
here
and
we
are
not
raising
a
question
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
govern
such
activity.
we
are
merely
stating
that
in
this
act
or
this
statute
under
which
petitioner
has
been
charged,
the
government
through
congress
did
not
prohibit
intrastate
sales.
it
merely
spoke
of
interstate
sales
and
we
feel
that
because
we
have
a
purely
intrastate
transaction
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
to
be
covered
under
title
iv.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
no
sir,
he
is
not.
he
is
out
on
parole.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir.
he
spent,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
approximately
a
year
and
eight
months
in
the
federal
penitentiary
in
texarkana.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
no
sir,
the
full
extent
of
his
sentence
has
not
been
served,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
would
think
that
that
would
make
it
a
bit
more
clear,
but
i
feel
the
congress
has
adequately
covered
the
situation
with
title
vii
when
they
placed
the
word
firearm
after
the
modifying
words
of
receiving,
possession,
or
transporting
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
“any
firearm”.
i
feel
that
that
phraseology
does
cover
any
firearm
which
at
anytime
in
the
past
has
been
transported
in
interstate
commerce
and
i
feel
the
congress
must
have
determined
that
there
was
a
deficiency
in
title
iv,
otherwise,
they
would
have
not
passed
title
vii.
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
there
would
be
a
redundancy
in
the
statutes,
but
i
do
not
feel
that
is
the
case.
i
feel
that
congress
recognized
that
there
was
a
loophole
in
title
iv
and
sometime
after
the
passage
of
title
vii,
they
passed
vii
to
amend
that
loophole.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
senator
long
who
was
one
of
the
sponsors
of
title
vii
proposed
an
amendment
on
the
floor
trying
to
close
the
problem
that
they
had
had
with
title
iv
and
it
was
his
contention
that
he
wanted
to
tie
up
title
iv
in
such
a
way
that
no
felon
at
any
time
might
possess
a
weapon.
in
response
to
a
question
from
senator
dodd
from
the
floor,
that
question
being
“senator
long
is
this
amendment
a
substitute
for
title
iv?”
senator
long
answered
that
indeed
it
was
not
a
substitute
for
title
iv,
rather
it
was
an
addition
thereto.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
existing
legislation
was
obviously
not
strong
enough
at
that
time,
otherwise
senator
long
would
not
have
proposed
this
amendment
to
cover
any
felon
possessing
any
weapon.
there
must
have
been
something
that
congress
saw
and
indeed
we
contend
that
there
is
something,
a
loophole
here,
but
there
must
have
been
something
that
congress
saw
that
would
have
encourage
them
to
pass
title
vii
to
cover
up
the
problems
that
they
have
been
having
with
title
iv.
indeed
in
house
report
1577
on
section
922
(h),
prior
to
its
passage,
the
house
report
stated
that
the
principle
purpose
of
title
iv
of
the
gun
control
act
was
“to
strengthen
federal
controls
over
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
in
firearms
and
the
history
of
that
bill
provided
that
what
the
government
was
attempting
to
establish
was
a
more
effective
licensing
system
with
respect
to
those
people
who
deal
in
firearms.
the
act
was
intended
to
limit
lawful
transactions
to
those
between
federal
licensees,
those
people
whom
the
government
had
given
permission
to
sell
firearms
or,
and
this
is
a
quote
from
the
congressional
record
at
page
14773,
the
act
that
is
section
922
would
limit
those
lawful
transactions
to
those
between
federal
licensees
or
to
those
persons
who
reside
in
the
same
state.
so
here
it
is
from
the
people
who
were
passing
the
bill,
words
from
their
own
mouth
saying,
we
are
not
attempting
to
legislate
intrastate
sales
between
people
who
live
in
the
same
state,
rather
we
are
trying
to
establish
government
regulation
over
the
firearms
dealers,
those
persons
to
whom
we
will
grant
licenses.
title
iv
was
passed
as
a
responsive
measure
to
the
national
concern
over
the
sale
and
the
transportation
of
firearms
across
state
lines.
the
people
of
this
country
had
spoken
to
congress,
had
told
them
of
the
need
to
curtail
this
activity
where
one
person
could
live
in
the
state
of
michigan,
go
into
the
state
of
ohio,
purchase
a
weapon,
and
then
go
back
into
the
state
of
michigan.
the
purpose
for
this
is
obviously
because
the
state
of
michigan
is
going
to
have
tougher
gun
laws
than
the
state
of
ohio.
it
is
easier
for
a
person
to
go
from
one
state
which
has
tough
laws
into
another
state.
in
addition,
congress
was
attempting
to
cut
off
the
mail
order
supply
of
guns
which
i
am
sure
the
court
is
aware
has
become
a
very
grievous
problem.
but
again,
we
are
talking
with
dealing
in
guns
and
persons
buying
guns
out
of
state.
gun
trafficking
is
what
section
922
attempted
to
curtail,
not
gun
possession.
house
bill
17735
or
section
922
(h)
as
we
have
here
was
passed
and
was
put
into
effect
by
congress
to
eliminate
this
interstate
or
across
state
line
trafficking
in
guns.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
key
in
this
situation
where
we
do
not
have
an
interstate
transaction,
also
quoted
from
house
report
1577
at
page
4415,
“the
congressman
stated
that
so
long
as
the
last
step
in
the
transaction
is
intrastate,
the
shipment
would
not
be
prohibited
by
federal
law.”
we
feel
this
is
the
crux
of
the
case
before
the
court
this
morning.
congress
did
not
intend,
house
of
representatives
did
not
intend
that
section
922
(h)
would
cover
intrastate
sales.
indeed
the
senate
concurred
in
that.
senator
tidings
who
was
one
of
the
major
sponsors
of
the
bill
felt
that
the
people
who
were
to
be
affected
by
922
(h)
were
“the
juveniles,
felons,
and
fugitives”
who
today
can
with
total
immunity
and
impunity
obtain
guns
by
mail
or
by
crossing
into
state
lines,
crossing
over
state
lines
into
neighboring
states
which
have
lax
or
no
gun
laws
at
all,
purchase
a
weapon
and
then
return
to
their
own
state.
here
we
are
talking
about
what
i
have
been
speaking
of
early
what
the
house
was
concerned
with.
that
is
the
felon
who
may
cross
a
state
line,
purchase
a
weapon
and
return
to
his
own
state.
that
is
a
different
situation
than
what
is
before
the
court
this
morning.
any
over-the-counter
sale,
according
to
senator
tidings,
was
to
be
prohibited
except
as
senator
tidings
said
in
the
buyer’s
home
state.
it
is
important
i
feel
to
define
the
word
buyer
and
what
senator
tidings
had
in
my
mind.
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
does
not
indicate
that
there
is
any
restriction
or
qualification
as
to
the
definition
of
buyer.
now,
in
other
parts
of
the
act,
they
have
defined
the
terms,
they
have
spoken
of
felons
and
fugitives
and
juveniles,
but
as
to
the
word
buyer,
there
has
been
no
distinction
or
qualification
as
used
in
this
meaning.
so
we
contend
that
if
senator
tidings
felt
that
a
citizen
could
buy
a
gun
in
his
home
state,
they
qualify
under
the
definition
of
buyer,
that
citizen
must
also
have
included
those
persons
under
disability
that
being
felons,
fugitives,
and
juveniles.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
your
honor,
it
has
been
my
experience
that
if
there
is
confusion
then
we
should
look
behind
the
plain
meanings
of
the
words
and
into
the
legislative
history.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
excuse
me
for
misunderstanding
your
question.
i
would
agree
with
you
then
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
would
control.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir,
i
did
agree
you
that
had
those
words
been
even
placed
in
the
statute,
it
would
have
made
it
more
clear
to
me.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
more
clear
and
i
cannot
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
that
would
be
entirely
determinative
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
but
for
myself
having
been
involved
in
the
case
for
over
two
years
now,
i
would
have
to
say
that
that
would
make
it
more
clear
to
me.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
believe
that
receive
indicates
receiving
in
interstate
commerce
transaction.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
i
think
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
was
to
regulate
those
persons
who
will
order
a
substantial
amount
of
guns
from
a
mail
order
house,
say
in
new
york
to
sell
in
ohio.
now,
indeed
they
are
buying
the
guns,
but
they
are
also
receiving
the
guns
in
a
shipment,
so
that
they
may
sell
on
themselves
and
their
home
state
and
that
as
i
see
it
that
is
gun
trafficking
and
that
is
what
i
believe
the
act
was
intended
to
prohibit
or
at
least
regulate
to
a
certain
extent.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
believe
that
the
congress
is
concerned
with
the
local
purchases
and
i
feel
that
congress,
once
they
passed
title
iv,
realized
that
they
were
not
effectively
prohibiting
or
controlling
local
purchases,
so
they
then
passed
title
vii
which
does
control
local
purchases.
i
would
agree
with
you
honor
that
congress
should
and
has
stepped
into
the
area
purely
intrastate
sales,
but
it
is
our
contention
they
did
not
do
so
in
this
act
and
i
feel
that
the
legislative
history,
the
words
of
the
senators
and
congressmen
as
to
why
they
were
passing
this
bill
indicates
that
it
was
their
purpose
to
control
the
trafficking
first
and
sometimes
subsequent
to
controlling
the
trafficking,
they
then
sought
to
control
the
possessions
of
intrastate
sales
or
possessions
that
occurred
from
intrastate
sales.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
the
ultimate
purpose
was
to
do
exactly
that.
my
reading
of
the
history
of
922
indicates
or
title
iv,
in
its
entirety
indicates
that
even
though
that
was
the
ultimate
purpose,
that
was
not
the
spoken
purpose
of
this
act.
time
after
time,
the
senators
and
the
congressmen
spoke
concerning
this
act
with
gun
trafficking
and
i
do
not
feel
that
intrastate
sales
fits
within
the
definition
of
gun
trafficking.
i
think
this
is
the
problem
that
occurred,
and
again
i
would
say
that
this
is
what
they
realized
after
they
passed
the
act
that
even
though
their
ultimate
purpose
was
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
felons
or
fugitives
or
juveniles,
they
had
not
accomplished
that
with
title
iv
and
i
would
simply
state
that
had
they
done
so
or
had
they
felt
they
had
done
so,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
pass
title
vii.
and
even
though
i
would
personally
agree
with
everything
that
they
did
in
title
vii
and
what
their
ultimate
consideration
was
in
title
iv,
i
respectfully
contend
that
they
did
not
accomplish
what
they
intended
to
do
with
title
iv
and
they
found
sooner
after
that
they
had
to
add
to
title
iv
and
control
purely
possessory
crimes
within
state
borders.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
sir,
i
think
that
it
is
distinguishable
in
that
the
identity
of
the
drugs
is
what
congress
was
intending
to
protect
in
the
sullivan
case
and
with
the
legislation
passed
to
cover
misbranding
of
drugs.
in
the
sullivan
set
of
facts,
we
have
a
package
of
drugs
which
passes
across
state
lines
and
is
labeled
brand
“x,”
if
you
will,
if
then
a
pharmacist
may
take
that
package
and
label
it
brand
“y,”
the
consumer
is
purchasing
something
which
he
has
been
misinformed
on.
i
would
agree
that
congress
certainly
has
the
power
to
protect
the
consumer
at
that
point,
but
i
also
feel
that
in
gun
situation,
we
do
not
have
quite
that
same
set
of
facts.
there
is
no
misinformation.
when
a
person
buys
a
gun,
the
act
of
buying
the
gun
itself,
he
may
end
up
shooting
himself
with
it
is
not
personally
harmful
to
him.
he
knows
what
he
is
purchasing
when
he
buys
it.
the
government
does
not
have
to
protect
his
intelligence
or
his
awareness
at
that
point.
with
misbranding
of
drugs
they
do.
they
have
taken
upon
themselves
to
protect
the
ultimate
consumer
for
misinformation
and
i
do
not
feel
that
is
what
we
have
in
the
gun
case.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
no
sir,
that
is
not
specifically
what
my
argument
is.
i
had
first
thought
that
that
might
be
what
i
would
attack,
but
looking
into
the
history
of
the
law,
that
is
not
point
of
contention
that
we
have
this
morning.
i
do
not
feel
that
what
the
government
has
done
is
in
and
off
itself
a
tenuous
or
an
arbitrary
decision
to
regulate
the
sale
of
guns.
i
just
feel
that
the
statute
under
which
mr.
barrett
was
charged
is
not
exactly
what
congress
intended
to
do.
it
is
not
worded
specifically
enough.
it
does
not
cover
the
transaction
that
is
involved
today.
i
would
say
that
we
are
here
to
argue
against
title
vii.
i
might
take
that
position
that
you
have
just
indicated
that
the
interstate
commerce
nexus
is
too
tenuous,
but
that
is
not
point
here
this
morning
and
i
do
not
really
feel
that
–-
quite
honestly
i
feel
that
title
vii
is
worded
in
such
a
way
and
according
to
the
case,
i
feel
that
it
would
stand
constitutional
attack
and
i
am
not
here
to
do
that.
i
am
not
here
to
attack
the
commerce
clause's
extension
into
the
interstate
sale
of
guns.
so
i
feel
that
even
though
sullivan
talks
about
that,
i
would
agree
with
what
was
said
in
sullivan,
but
i
would
distinguish
it
in
that
we
are
talking
about
a
different
type
of
product
which
is
being
shipped
interstate
and
we
are
talking
about
a
different
reason
for
regulation
by
the
federal
government.
there
have
been,
as
i
am
sure
the
court
is
aware,
a
number
of
cases
which
have
come
from
the
circuits
regarding
the
interpretation
of
title
iv
and
i
have
cited
these
in
my
brief.
i
have
cited,
there
appears
to
be
a
split
as
to
what
the
circuits
feel
and
there
has
not
been
up
until
this
point
a
great
deal
of
law
from
the
supreme
court
because
the
cases
have
not
come
before
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
believe
that
if
we
accept
the
government’s
position,
the
only
thing
that
mr.
barrett
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
buy
a
gun,
purchased
in
the
state
of
kentucky.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes.
(voice
overlap)
i
am
sorry.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir.
if
we
accept
the
government’s
position,
i
feel
that
is
the
only
thing
that
he
could
have
done
to
protect
himself
and
the
question
you
raise
is
a
good
one,
how
would
a
purchaser
know
where
a
gun
is
manufactured
and
is
it
that
raising
too
much
of
a
burden
on
a
citizen
to
ask
not
only
may,
i
purchase
the
gun,
but
from
where
did
it
come?
i
do
not
feel
that
--
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
would
say
that
if
we
were
to
accept
the
government’s
position
then
the
person
purchasing
the
weapon
would
be
knows
that
he
is
committing
or
violating
a
federal
law.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir,
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
again
if
we
accept
the
government’s
position
that
is
in
essence
the
crime
or
the
act
which
is
being
prohibited
by
the
statute
as
they
see
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
through
this
--
the
record
indicates
that
the
seller
of
the
gun
never
presented
that
form
to
him.
he
never
had
the
form
in
front
of
him.
he
never
made
any
statements
as
to
whether
he
was
a
convicted
felon.
however,
he
did
state
on
cross-examination
and
had
he
been
asked
that,
had
he
been
asked
if
he
were
a
convicted
felon,
he
would
have
answered
yes,
but
he
was
never
given
the
opportunity.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
yes
sir,
i
think
what
happen
was
that
he
knew
the
seller
of
the
gun.
this
is
was
his
hometown
and
he
had
known
this
person
for
sometime
and
i
believe
that
what
happened
was
he
went
in
and
he
placed
half
of
the
money
down
for
the
gun,
picked
up
the
gun
and
said
i
will
be
back
on
monday
to
pay
the
rest
of
the
money.
now,
i
think
what
the
seller
might
have
been
thinking,
although
it
is
not
indicated
in
the
record,
is
it
might
have
occurred
to
him
over
the
weekend
that
he
failed
to
give
him
the
form,
but
when
he
returned
on
monday,
he
might
ask
him
at
that
time
to
fill
it
out,
but
we
do
not
have
any
problem
here
as
we
have
in
some
of
the
cases
in
the
circuit
where
he
made
a
false
statement.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
he
did
not
say.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
did
not
represent
him
at
the
trial
court
and
he
did
not
say.
i
might
say
though
that
the
cases
that
i
have
handled
from
the
state
of
kentucky,
people
have
come
out
and
said
on
the
stand
that
everyone
owns
a
gun
in
kentucky.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
something
like
that.
this
court
has
spoken
as
i
am
sure
the
bench
is
aware
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
bass,
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
that
is
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
the
only
case
law
that
has
come
down
and
i
will
admit
that
that
was
not
form
of
dicta.
it
was
not
the
holding
of
the
case.
that
case
concerns
as
i
am
sure
the
bench
is
aware
with
title
vii,
it
was
concerned
with
section
1202
and
in
that
opinion,
mr.
justice
marshall
stated
that
he
felt
that
section
1202
or
title
vii
was
significantly
broader
in
reach
than
title
iv
and
he
felt
that
by
reading
section
1202
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
it
a
broader
interpretation,
he
felt
that
that
preserved
the
significant
difference
between
the
receipt
offenses
of
title
iv
and
title
vii
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
contend
today
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
receipt
offenses.
one,
it
concerns
intrastate
receipt
that
is
title
vii
whereas
title
iv
concerns
itself
only
with
interstate
receipt.
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
the
case
huddleston
versus
the
united
states
which
is
cited
by
respondent
stated
that
he
felt
that
from
the
outset
it
was
apparent
to
him
anyway
that
the
focus
of
the
federal
law
that
being
section
922
was
the
federally
licensed
firearms
dealer,
the
trafficker,
the
seller.
that
is
the
person
or
those
are
the
people
to
whom
section
922
was
to
apply.
mr.
justice
blackmun
went
on
to
say
that
he
felt
the
intent
of
the
act
was
to
force
the
dealers
in
certain
circumstances
not
to
sell,
to
prohibit
them
from
selling
to
certain
individuals,
so
again,
the
focus
is
here
on
the
dealer
and
not
the
buyer
that
is
section
922.
petitioner,
were
he
charged
under
title
vii,
i
contend
this
quite
strongly
would
not
have
the
argument
that
we
have
made
today.
i
feel
that
title
vii
does
cover
intrastate
sales.
title
iv
as
i
hope
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
this
morning,
title
iv
was
enacted
to
control
the
business
of
selling
guns.
title
iv
went
into
great
detail
about
licensing
provisions,
regulations
as
to
license,
licensees
or
sellers
of
guns.
they
went
into
strict
rules
as
to
whom
the
licensee
might
sell
these
guns.
it
dealt
specifically
with
intrastate
transactions.
it
talked
about
mail
order
guns.
it
talked
about
going
across
across
state
line
to
purchase
a
weapon.
mr.
thomas
a.
schaffer
i
believe
922
(a).
i
believe
that
is
the
section
your
honor.
that
concerns
itself
with
dealers
and
the
section
is
subsequent
to
2
(a)
i
believe
(b)
(c)
and
(d)
deals
specifically
with
the
regulations
on
the
licensed
seller.
petitioner,
we
contend
this
morning,
if
there
was
indeed
a
loophole
in
title
iv,
that
although
congress
intended
ultimately
to
control
intrastate
transactions,
it
did
not
do
so
with
title
iv
and
we
would
point
out
that
had
there
not
been
a
loophole,
there
would
not
have
been
a
reason
for
title
vii
which
is
passed
some
time
after
title
iv.
we
contend
then
the
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
reversed
on
this
basis.
he
purchased
the
gun
in
his
home
state
of
kentucky.
he
purchased
it
in
his
hometown.
he
did
not
live
the
state
of
kentucky.
he
was
caught
within
the
state
of
kentucky
with
that
weapon
and
other
than
the
fact
that
the
gun
itself
was
manufactured
out
side
of
the
state
of
kentucky,
there
is
no
other
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention
this
morning.
