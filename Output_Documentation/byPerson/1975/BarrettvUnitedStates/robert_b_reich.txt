mr.
robert
b.
reich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
question
before
this
court
this
morning
concerns
the
scope
of
section
922
(h)
of
the
gun
control
act.
section
922
(h)
is
set
out
at
page
11(a)
of
our
appendix.
it
provides
in
pertinent
parts
that
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
person
and
then
there
are
four
categories.
the
first
category
is
who
is
under
indictment
for
or
who
has
been
convicted
in
any
court
of
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
term
exceeding
one
year.
that
latter
category
of
person
whom
i
shall
refer
to
as
a
convicted
felon,
who
is
a
fugitive
from
justice,
who
is
unlawful
user
or
addicted
to
marijuana
or
any
depressant
or
stimulant
drug
or
a
narcotic
drug,
who
has
been
adjudicated
as
a
matter
of
de
facto
or
who
as
been
committed
to
any
mental
institution.
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
someone
falling
within
any
of
these
categories
to
receive
any
firearm
or
ammunition
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
the
meaning
of
that
provision
we
submit
is
clear.
once
it
is
established
that
a
firearm
is
a
firearm
that
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce
then
federal
jurisdiction
is
established.
there
is
no
indication
from
the
language
that
congress
intended
to
limit
its
scope
to
those
instances
where
the
interstate
shipment
or
transportation
immediately
precedes
the
receipt.
indeed
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
no,
mr.
justice
brennan
we
do
not.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
apologize.
we
do
not
perceive
any
difficulties
with
it
that
way.
indeed
in
huddleston
against
united
states,
this
court
in
construing
section
922
(a)
(6)
held
that
that
provision
does
apply
to
an
intrastate,
wholly
intrastate
redemption
at
a
pawn
broker
shop
where
there
had
been
absolutely
no
contention
that
the
firearm
had
ever
been
shipped
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
government
could
indeed
have
prosecuted
them
under
title
vii.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
none
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
have
absolutely
no
idea.
the
u.s.
attorney,
assistant
u.s.
attorney
obviously
assumed
that
the
prosecution
could
be
brought
under
either
provision.
but
had
the
government
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
bass
opinion
we
would
contend
mr.
justice
stewart,
did
not
authoritatively
construe
title
iv
which
was
to
become
section
922
(h)
as
being
limited
to
direct
interstate
receipts
and
if
you
enable
me
to
get
to
the
bass
opinion
in
just
one
moment,
i
would
like
to
state
that
had
the
government
intended
to
limit
the
scope
of
section
922
(h)
to
direct
interstate
receipts
as
petitioner
urges,
it
presumably,
in
the
gun
control
act,
would
have
use
language
to
that
effect,
such
as
section
922
(j)
which
you
find
on
page
12(a)
of
our
appendix
which
states
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
receive
a
stolen
firearm
which
is
moving
as
or
which
is
a
part
of
or
which
constitutes
interstate
commerce
or
section
922
(k)
which
is
also
on
page
12(a)
of
our
appendix
which
states
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
receive
in
commerce
any
firearm
which
has
had
the
importers
or
manufacturer’s
serial
number
removed.
i
think
it
is
very
indicative
that
congress
rather
than
employ
these
standard
phrases
which
is
a
part
over
which
it
constitutes
or
which
is
moving
as
or
a
firearm
in
commerce
chose
instead
to
provide
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
convicted
felon
or
other
category
of
potentially
irresponsible
person
to
receive
a
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
the
structure
of
the
gun
control
act
confirms
our
reading
of
the
plain
language.
the
gun
control
act
is
a
comprehensive
scheme
whose
provisions
reveal
a
common
design
to
keep
firearms
from
coming
into
a
state
and
falling
into
the
hands
of
convicted
felons
or
other
categories
of
potentially
irresponsible
persons.
now,
to
this
end,
licensees,
all
interstate
shipments
of
firearms
must
be
channeled
through
licensees.
once
a
firearm
has
reached
a
state,
come
into
a
state,
the
licensee
is
prohibited
in
an
intrastate
transaction
from
selling
or
otherwise
transferring
of
firearm
to
a
convicted
felon
or
an
indictee,
a
fugitive,
or
any
other
category
of
potentially
irresponsible
person,
that
is
an
intrastate
transaction.
also,
in
an
intrastate
transaction
a
purchaser
must
attest
truthfully
that
he
is
not
a
convicted
felon
and
that
he
is
not
also
an
indictee,
a
fugitive,
or
other
category
potentially
irresponsible
person.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
man
who
sold
this
gun
should
have
found
out.
now,
section
22
(d)
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
he
was
not
guilty
of
knowingly
selling
a
firearm
to
a
convicted
felon
as
922
(d)
provides
because
he
did
not
follow
the
required
procedure
and
have
the
purchaser
fill
out
a
treasury
form
4477.
so
he
is
perhaps
guilty.
in
fact,
he
is
guilty
of
violating
the
treasury
regulations
requiring
a
dealer
to
have
a
purchaser
fill
out
this
form
so
that
the
dealer
can
know
whether
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
he
was
warned.
he
was
not
indicted
nor
was
he
prosecuted.
he
was
warned
that
if
this
happened
again,
however,
he
would
be.
but
the
dealer
also
with
an
intrastate
transaction
according
to
the
gun
control
act
has
to
keep
careful
records
of
all
the
people
to
whom
he
sells.
yes
sir?
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
all
these
provisions
are
being
enforced.
now,
the
one
instance
in
this
case
where
the
dealer
had
violated
the
regulation
in
terms
of
not
finding
out
specifically
whether
this
man
was
a
convicted
felon
in
that
intrastate
transaction
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
i
would
say
that
it
is
not
alright.
were
the
u.s.
assistant
attorney
in
charge
of
this
case,
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
indictment
of
this
dealer.
unfortunately,
in
terms
of
prosecutorial
discretion,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
or
the
u.s.
attorney
did
not
follow
through
on
that,
but
did
give
the
dealer
a
warning.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
i
simply
am
not
aware
or
not
sure
of
that
answer
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
if
is
not
a
criminal
offense
to
violate
this
treasury
regulations
he
would
not
have
been
prosecuted.
i
am
assuming
from
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
for
the
sake
of
the
question
that
it
would
be
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
my
point
is
that
all
of
these
provisions,
including
a
provision
that
requires
that
a
purchaser
attest
truthfully,
certify
truthfully
in
an
intrastate
transaction
that
he
is
not
a
convicted
felon.
all
of
them
have
the
common
purpose
of
keeping
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
a
convicted
felon,
even
in
an
intrastate
transaction
and
it
is
the
government’s
submission
that
section
922
(h),
our
reading
of
section
922
(h)
makes
that
an
integral
part
of
this
comprehensive
scheme
because
it
deters
directly
that
which
the
rest
of
those
provisions
i
indicated
seek
to
deter
indirectly.
now,
petitioner’s
construction
of
section
922
(h)
would
create
a
major
gap
in
this
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
because
it
would
enable
a
convicted
felon
to
receive
a
firearm
as
in
the
instant
case
through
the
inadvertence
or
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
dealer
who
simply
neglected
to
find
out
whether
he
was
a
convicted
felon
or
to
the
simple
expedient
of
getting
a
friend
or
a
relative
or
somebody
else
to
get
it
for
him.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
dealer
was
questioned
on
the
stand.
he
indicated
that
he
had
known
the
buyer,
petitioner
for
five
years,
had
absolutely
no
idea
that
he
was
a
convicted
felon
and
because
it
was
saturday
night,
he
was
going
to
have
petitioner
come
back
and
fill
out
the
forms
monday
morning.
he
just
simply
did
not
feel
that
it
was
important.
he
thought
it
was
a
mere
formality
because
he
had
known
the
guy.
but
this
is
an
example
of
how
through
this
kind
of
carelessness
the
entire
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
of
the
gun
control
act
can
be
undermined.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
if
he
had
filled
it
out
and
if
the
dealer
had
looked
at
it,
we
would
not
have
this
case,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
conceivable
mr.
justice.
what
is
also
possible,
in
fact,
even
more
conceivable
is
that
a
convicted
felon
or
a
fugitive
or
a
narcotics
addict
who
wants
to
obtain
a
firearm,
but
who
wants
to
avoid
all
these
prophylactic
rules
need
only
under
petitioner’s
construction
get
his
friend
or
relative
or
somebody
on
the
street
to
go
and
get
it
for
him.
now,
it
seems
to
us
very
unlikely
that
congress
in
enacting
the
gun
control
act
with
all
these
measures
designed
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
convicted
felons,
even
with
an
intrastate
transaction
would
have
created
such
a
major
gap
in
the
scheme.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
under
section
922
(g)
which
i
believe
is
set
out
at
page
10
(a)
of
our
appendix,
under
922
(g),
a
convicted
felon
or
other
category
of
potentially
irresponsible
person
is
barred
from
shipping
or
transporting
a
gun
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
read
in
conjunction
with
section
2
(b)
of
title
xviii
which
makes
one
punishable
as
a
principal,
if
he
causes
an
act
to
be
committed,
section
922
(g)
would
indeed
bar
a
convicted
felon
or
other
category
potentially
irresponsible
person
from
ordering
or
soliciting
a
gun
across
a
state
line.
in
fact
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
absolutely
right
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
prosecution,
if
the
gun
happened
to
be
on
the
shelf,
in
fact
in
the
instant
case,
the
firearm
just
happened
to
be
the
last
one
in
the
dealer’s
stock.
if
it
happens
to
be
on
the
shelf
under
petitioner’s
construction,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
act.
if
the
dealer
has
to
order
it
for
him
under
922
(g)
as
i
already
indicated,
there
is
indeed
a
violation
of
the
act
and
it
is
improbable
that
congress
intended
that
an
offense
under
the
gun
control
act
would
turn
upon
the
vagaries
of
a
dealer’s
inventory
in
such
a
way.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
scienter
is
left
out
of
the
statute
at
922
(h),
it
is
left
out
of
--
scienter
enters
into
one
or
two
other
provisions
where
convicted
felons
or
other
individuals
are
prohibited
for
instance
from
knowingly
receiving
as
to
one
firearm,
but
you
are
correct
that
scienter
does
not
enter
into
section
922
(h).
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
correct.
section
922
(h)
puts
the
burden
directly
upon
the
convicted
felon.
it
puts
him
on
notice
that
if
he
receives
a
firearm
that
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
he
is
liable.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
he
could
be
fairly
well
sure
that
he
would
not
be
violating
the
statute,
however,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
although
manufactured
in
connecticut,
the
firearm
had
traveled
outside
the
state
at
some
point
in
its
history.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
violate
the
statute
because
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
indicate
only
that
it
is
illegal
to
receive
a
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce
and
presumably
that
means
across
a
state
boundary.
i
think
it
would
make
the
act
somewhat
unworkable
to
extend
interstate
commerce
to
mean
any
order
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
was
a
finding
in
the
senate
report.
in
fact,
at
the
beginning
of
the
senate
report,
there
were
series
of
findings
that
did
not
make
their
way
into
the
final
draft
for
reason
i
do
not
quite
understand,
often
findings
in
final
reports
of
the
senate
or
congress
simply
do
not
find
their
way
into
final
drafts,
but
that
senate
finding
is
i
think
quite
indicative.
it
states
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
no,
but
it
is
indicative,
i
think
it
is
congressional
intent
as
to
whether
congress
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
that
may
be
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history,
however,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
it
might
be
indicative
that
the
senate
did
find
and
declare
that
the
ease
with
which
any
person
can
acquire
firearms,
including
criminals,
narcotics
addicts,
mental
defectives,
is
significant
factor
in
the
prevalence
of
lawlessness.
my
point
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
not
that
there
was
a
specific
finding
that
congress
intended
to
encompass
intrastate
transactions.
perhaps
because
congress
felt
that
it
was
very
clear
from
the
structure
of
the
act
and
as
this
court
held
in
huddleston,
many
provisions
of
the
act
already
pertain
to
intrastate
transactions.
the
finding
to
which
i
was
referring
is
merely
a
general
broad
finding
that
congress
was
concerned
with
keeping
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
convicted
felons
and
not
limiting
itself
only
to
interstate
transactions.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
mr.
justice
brennan
to
be
to
be
sure
when
congress
enacted
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
as
you
point
out,
it
must
have
been
aware
to
some
extent
of
the
court’s
holding
in
tot
striking
down
the
presumption
that
was
struck
down
from
section
2
(f)
of
the
federal
firearms
act
which
is
the
predecessor.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
we
would
contend
that
given
(a)
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase
to
receive
any
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce
plus
(b)
the
fact
that
in
1943
in
the
tot
case,
this
court
did
not
really
focus
upon
the
question
of
the
scope
of
section
2
(f)
but
merely
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
i
was
not
alive
then[laughter]
mr.
robert
b.
reich
it
did
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
indeed.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
we
are
saying
that
congress
given
the
fact
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
there
is
absolutely
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
there
is
absolutely
not
indication
in
any
of
the
legislation
history
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
department
of
justice
i
assume
participated
in
write-up
sessions.
however,
your
honor
i
would
point
out
that
as
this
court
has
held
repeatedly,
it
would
require
very
persuasive
circumstances
in
developing
congressional
silence,
including
a
reenactment
of
a
statute
to
debar
the
court
from
re-examining
its
own
doctrines.
now,
the
department
of
justice,
the
government
has
reassessed
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
it
is.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example
if
i
may
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
i
have
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
girouard
against
the
united
states
in
which
this
court
has
construed
the
naturalization
act.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
girouard
against
the
united
states.
it
is
at
328
u.s.
61
in
which
this
court
re-construed
the
naturalization
act
which
had
been
recently
reenacted
by
congress
and
that
is
after
the
court
had
construed
the
same
language
three
times
before,
nevertheless
that
court
held
that
congress
when
it
reacted
the
naturalization
oath
provision
in
the
naturalization
act
simply
could
not
have
paid
much
attention
to
the
court’s
three
prior
holdings
and
we
do
not
have
the
situation
here
where
the
court
merely
assumed
or
relied
upon
two
lower
courts
or
relied
upon
the
government’s
representation.
in
girouard
we
have
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
i
do
not
think
i
would
want
to
do
that.
i
think
i
would
stick
with
girouard,
zuber
against
allen
and
other
instances
in
which
it
is
clear
that
this
court
has
looked
upon
past
pronouncements,
a
pass
construction
as
being
simply
implausible
and
because
of
its
implausibility,
particularly
here,
because
congress
may
never
have
focused
upon
a
relatively
implausible
construction,
granted,
one
that
the
government
is
in
part
responsible
for,
i
may
add
that
the
government
has
of
course
reassessed
its
position
with
regard
to
the
scope
of
the
language
in
section
2
(f)
and
it
decided
that
it
was
simply
wrong
that
congress
would
not
have
used
the
broad
statement,
the
broad
language
to
receive
any
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported,
even
in
1938,
had
it
not
meant
to
encompass
any
transaction
in
a
firearm?
mr.
robert
b.
reich
after
perez,
after
this
court’s
opinion
on
perez
that
is
i
think
an
open
question.
i
would
say
that
as
this
court
noted
in
huddleston
mr.
justice,
there
are
many
parts
of
the
act,
the
gun
control
act
where
the
gun
itself
has
never
necessarily
been
involved
in
interstate
commerce
where
the
act
was
held
to
be
completely
constitutional,
as
that
provision
i
pointed
out
before
the
922
(a)
(6)
governing
a
redemption
from
a
pawnshop.
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
right
now
because
we
do
have
a
statute
in
which
congress
has
clearly
stated
that
what
is
unlawful
is
to
receipt
of
any
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
the
gap
to
which
i
referred
was
the
ease
with
which
a
convicted
felon
or
any
other
category
could
simply
receive
a
gun
through
either
the
inadvertence
of
a
dealer
or
by
the
simple
experience
of
getting
a
third
party,
a
friend
or
relative
to
get
for
them.
now,
mr.
justice
powell,
you
point
out
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
ninth
--
under
1202
(a)
for
categories
that
are
not
included
within
922,
where
there
is
not
an
overlap
between
those
two
provisions,
all
those
individuals
according
to
the
construction
that
a
plurality
of
this
court
gave
to
section
9
1202
(a)
in
bass,
there
would
be
no
gap
because
they
would
be
prohibited
from
receiving
a
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
or
possessing,
that
is
right,
but
as
to
fugitives
or
indictees
or
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
--
addicts
or
even
as
to
ammunition,
i
think
it
is
important
area
where
the
statutes
do
not
overlap
has
to
do
with
ammunition.
ammunition
is
covered
in
title
iv
which
became
the
gun
control
act
922
(h),
but
is
not
included
within
1202
(a),
so
therefore,
even
under
petitioner’s
construction
any
adjudicated
narcotics
addict,
to
a
fugitive
or
an
indictee
can
with
impunity
get
somebody
to
get
a
gun
for
him,
get
ammunition
for
him,
even
a
convicted
felon
can
with
impunity
get
someone
to
get
ammunition
for
him.
we
think
congress
simply
did
not
intend
to
create
this
gap,
especially
when
used
such
plain
language.
i
might
also
say
that
whatever
congress
intended,
in
1938,
with
regard
to
that
language,
given
the
structure
of
the
gun
control
act
in
1968,
given
all
the
prophylactic
measures
which
i
have
mentioned
that
are
geared
toward
keeping
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
convicted
felons
or
other
categories
of
potentially
irresponsible
persons
and
also
given
that
congress
must
have
been
aware
in
1968
of
its
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
to
enact
legislation
that
govern
interstate
transactions.
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
congress
used
this
language
and
gave
it,
its
common
sense
meaning
that
is
that
it
covers
the
receipt
of
any
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
one
more
thing,
petitioner's
construction
922
(h)
would
also
relegate
section
922
(h)
to
a
near
redundancy
with
that
provision
i
mentioned
before,
section
922
(g)
which
already
prohibits
a
convicted
felon
or
other
category
of
potentially
irresponsible
person
from
shipping,
transporting,
or
causing
to
be
shipped
or
transported
in
an
interstate
transaction
of
firearm,
so
that
under
petitioner’s
construction
922
(h)
would
have
an
independent
force
and
effect
only
in
those
very
unique
circumstances
where
the
interstate
shipment
has
not
been
solicited
in
any
way
by
the
convicted
felon.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes
sir,
i
mentioned
before
mr.
justice
stewart
that
read
in
conjunction
with
section
2
(b)
of
title
xviii
which
makes
one
punishable
as
a
principle
who
causes
it
to
be
doing
that,
922
(g)
would
have
a
scope
that
would
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
2
(b).
so
therefore,
section
922
(h)
under
petition’s
construction
as
i
said
would
be
limited
to
the
very
rare
circumstance
where
the
interstate
shipment
had
not
been
solicited.
we
think
a
very
implausible
that
congress
intended
to
assign
section
922
(a)
with
such
an
absurdly
insignificant
role
in
this
comprehensive
scheme.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
the
legislative
history
as
we
–-
mr.
robert
b.
reich
i
remember
your
honor
that
one
of
the
senate
reports
did
cite
those
studies
indicating
the
increase
in
hand
guns,
but
i
just
do
not
remember
which
report
it
was.
