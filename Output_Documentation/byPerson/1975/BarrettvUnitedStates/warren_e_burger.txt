chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
74-5566,
barrett
against
the
united
states.
mr.
schaffer
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
that
congress
has
no
power
to
forbid
the
possession
of
a
firearm
shipped
at
any
time
in
the
past
in
those
terms
in
interstate
commerce,
the
prohibition
being
limited
to
certain
categories,
including
convicted
felons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
say
that
the
congress
could
do
it,
but
they
did
not
do
it
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
coming
to
the
language,
you
have
said
that
congress
has
the
powers
to
prohibit
a
felon
from
possessing
or
receiving
a
firearm
that
has
at
anytime
in
the
past
been
received
--
been
shipped
in
interstate
commerce.
you
conceded
they
have
power
to
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
the
statute
does
not
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
words
would
you
--
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
in
that
last
paragraph
of
section
(h)
to
receive
any
firearm
or
ammunition
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
with
the
word
which
has
ever
before,
would
that
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
colloquy
among
senators
or
representatives
explaining
or
undertaking
to
explain
the
bill
is
in
conflict
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
which
is
to
prevail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
try
my
question
again.
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
plain
and
clear
and
unambiguous,
but
some
senators
and
congressmen
expressed
the
different
view
of
what
they
thought
it
meant
which
then
controls
the
language
or
the
views
of
two
or
three
senators?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
this
statute
has
to
receive
any
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
this
is
where
it
is
shipped
at
sometime
in
interstate
commerce
and
you
have
indicated
at
least
tentatively,
i
thought
that
if
the
statute
had
inserted
the
words
which
has
ever
before
been
shipped
or
which
was
previously
shipped
then
you
would
not
be
here,
that
is
what
i
thought
you
had
conceded?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
clear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
was
not
the
objectives
of
congress
to
keep
the
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
individuals,
just
a
given
person
who
fall
within
the
statute,
that
has
had
prior
criminal
conviction
or
categories?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
in
mind
the
case
of
united
states
against
sullivan
involving
misbranded
drugs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
black
writing
that
opinion
says
it
really
did
not
make
any
difference
that
these
drugs
had
come
to
rest
in
the
state
and
have
been
on
the
shelf
for
six
months
before.
does
that
have
some
implication
on
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
my
question
at
what
seemed
to
be
your
argument
that
the
interstate
relationship
was
too
tenuous
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
section
of
922
are
you
talking
about
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
reich.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
would
not
have
the
case
if
both
of
them
non-violated
the
act
by
selling
it
notwithstanding
the
disclosure
of
the
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
had
that
in
mind
that
the
statute
might
well
have
been
written
with
an
insert,
known
to
him
to
have
been
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
or
knowingly
receiving?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
scienter
factor
was
left
out
of
the
statute,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
puts
the
burden
on
the
purchaser
who
wants
to
be
careful
i
suppose
on
your
theory
of
the
case,
to
inquire
whether
it
is
manufactured
in
kentucky
or
elsewhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
mean
that
when
you
take
justice
brennan’s
illustration
a
while
ago
that
if
a
man
in
hartford,
nevada
“pistol”
manufactured
it
in
new
heaven,
connecticut,
he
would
not
be
violating
a
statute,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
has
not
legislated
in
this
area
or
i
will
put
it
as
a
question.
could
they
have
legislated
in
this
area
if
they
did
not
have
the
interstate
aspect
in
the
statute?
if
the
they
have
simply
said
that
it
was
unlawful
for
a
felon
to
receive
any
firearm
or
ammunition.
would
there
be
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
one
of
the
congressional
reports,
perhaps
it
was
not
on
this
statute,
maybe
you
can
enlighten
me,
committee
of
congress
made
a
finding
that
the
possession
of
hand
guns
had
increased
in
the
last
25
or
30
years,
seven
or
eight
times
the
rate
of
increase
of
population,
is
that
any
of
those
reports
cited
in
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
recall
it?
i
am
speaking
to
the
speaking
point.
it
was
enormous
increase
in
the
proliferation
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
an
opinion
for
announcement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
