justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
concede
that
congress
could
make
it
an
offense
to
buy
a
pistol
that
had
been
in
the
state
of
kentucky
for
10
years
if
10
years
previously
that
had
been
shipped
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
think
there
is
any
problem
as
to
congress’
authority
to
do
something
like
i
described?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
think
the
word
“receive”
in
the
statute
means?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
broader
term
than
“buy,”
is
it
not?
i
mean,
i
receive
something
from
you
if
you
hand
it
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schaffer,
if
your
client
had
wanted
to
avoid
violating
the
statute
as
the
government
construes
it,
what
steps
could
he
have
taken
to
advice
himself
as
to
whether
or
not
the
gun
he
sought
to
purchase
was
prohibited?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
did
not
have
to
buy
a
gun
manufactured
in
kentucky?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
criminal
offense
to
violate
the
treasury
regulations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
would
he
had
been
prosecuted
for,
if
it
is
not
a
criminal
offense
to
violate
the
treasury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
moved
down
in
interstate
train
from
hartford
to
new
heaven?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
on
page
13(a)
mr.
reich
of
your
brief
where
you
set
out
18
u.s.c.
appendix
1201
which
i
believe
is
the
introductory
section
of
title
vii
that
congress
passed
later
and
there
you
have
a
kind
of
finding
that
you
have
in
many
recent
acts
of
congress
that
congress
finds
and
declares
that
the
receipt,
possession
etcetera
is
a
burden
on
commerce.
in
other
words,
our
finding
for
the
purposes
of
that
legislation
in
its
entirety
that
these
particular
intrastate
acts
do
burden
interstate
commerce
and
then
you
have
section
1202
which
does
clearly
regardless
of
immediate
shipment
of
interstate
commerce,
make
it
unlawful
for
a
felon
to
purchase
a
gun
and
then
you
go
back
to
the
act
that
this
man
was
prosecuted
under.
now,
is
there
not
any
sort
of
generalized
finding
such
as
there
was
on
1201
that
congress
uses
what
it
wants
to
embrace
a
lot
of
intrastate
transactions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
entitled
to
the
same
degree
of
weight
as
if
it
had
made
its
way
as
you
put
it
into
the
legislation?
