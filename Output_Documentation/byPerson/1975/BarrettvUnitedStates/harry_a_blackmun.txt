justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
this
record
show
whether
he
filled
out
a
form
44773
when
he
purchased
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
he
advised
that
at
western
auto
store,
he
received
no
form?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
was
his
explanation
for
having
a
loaded
gun
in
the
automobile
so
soon
after
purchase?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
explanation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
difference
does
it
make?
we
are
talking
about
the
felon
anyway,
are
we
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
reich.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
suggest
to
you.
suppose
he
went
in
to
see
his
old
friend,
the
dealer
and
said,
i
want
a
particular
model,
but
the
dealer
did
not
have
it.
he
said,
order
it
for
me
and
so
he
ordered
it
from
south
carolina,
then
would
he
be
subject
to
prosecution,
clearly?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
to
bring
out
as
the
fact
that
just
the
accident
of
having
the
gun
on
the
show
or
not
having
at
all
in
the
shelf,
on
your
oppositionâ€™s
theory,
it
would
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
the
prosecutor
is
capable
of
prosecution
or
not.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
as
74-5566
barrett
against
the
united
states.
it
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
raises
the
issue
whether
a
provision
of
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
which
is
section
922
(h)
of
title
18
of
the
code,
making
it
unlawful
for
a
convicted
felon
to
receive
any
firearm
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
commerce
has
application
to
a
convicted
felon's
intrastate
purchase
from
a
local
retail
dealer
of
a
firearm
that
previously,
but
independently
had
been
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
petitioner
barrett
in
1967
was
convicted
of
a
felony
in
a
kentucky
state
court.
five
years
later,
he
purchased
32-caliber
smith
&
wesson
revolver
from
a
western
auto
store
in
booneville,
kentucky,
where
he
lived.
the
weapon
had
been
manufactured
in
massachusetts
and
then
shipped
to
a
distributor
in
north
carolina
and
then
received
by
the
kentucky
dealer
from
the
north
carolina
distributor.
barrett
bought
it
off
the
shelf
from
the
booneville
store.
after
the
revolver
fully
loaded
was
discovered
in
barrett's
possession
as
he
was
arrested
by
a
county
sheriff
for
driving
while
intoxicated.
barrett
was
charged
with
the
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
the
federal
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
statute's
interstate
requirements
was
satisfied
if
the
firearm
at
sometime
in
the
past
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
irrespective
of
the
defendant's
non-involvement
personally
in
that
transportation
across
the
state
line,
the
verdict
of
guilty
was
returned
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
by
divided
vote
affirmed.
because
this
holding
seemed
to
conflict
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
in
another
case,
we
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
interstate
issue.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
statute
does
indeed
apply
to
a
convicted
felon's
intrastate
purchase
of
a
firearm
that
previously,
but
independently
of
the
felon's
receipt
had
been
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
white
while
joining
the
opinion
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion
and
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
