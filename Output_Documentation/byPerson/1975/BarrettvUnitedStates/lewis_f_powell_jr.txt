could
the
government
have
prosecuted
this
defendant
under
title
vii?
justice
lewis

is
there
any
explanation
why
he
did
not
in
light
of
a
previous
interpretation
of
that
section
in

powell,

you
said
that
there
would
be
gap,
a
serious
gap
in
the
legislation
regulating
gun
control
if
we
accepted
the
interpretation
of
922
as
suggested
by
the
defendant.
the
statutes
do
cover
different
situations
to
some
extent,
fugitives
from
justice
and
drug
addicts
are
covered
by
922
and
not
by
title
vii,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
there
were
some
other
gaps,
would
you
mind
clarifying
that
or
repeat
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
unique
to
922
or
would
that
not
also
apply
under
--
justice

f.

or
possessing?
