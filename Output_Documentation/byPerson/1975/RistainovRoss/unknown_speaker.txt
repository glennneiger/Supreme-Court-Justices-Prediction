(inaudible)
to
the
panel
not
individually
members
of
the

the
question
were
put
to
the
panel—
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
against
the
people
who
were
charged
with
the
killing
or
assaulting
the
policeman,
that
could
be
one
of
the
general,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
did
the,
did
the
offense
get
a
great
deal
of
publicity?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
would
foreclose
you
from
acting
that
should
only
be
hunched
only
be
perspective.

footnote
four
of
that.
unknown

what
about
footnote
five?
on
the
next
page.
unknown
speaker
so
that,
in
this
case
whether
it
non-statutory
additional,
and-
unknown
speaker
did
the
clerk
answers
these
questions?
unknown
speaker
not
the
judge?
unknown

and
never
counsel?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
--
panel
is
very
large,
does
that
differ
by—
unknown
speaker
how
long
did
he
serve
as
juror?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
showed
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
you
know
what
the
term
for
petty
jurors
is?
unknown
speaker
--is
there
in
this
county?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
have
a
41
or
42
of
your
brief,
anybody
else
has
got
that?
unknown
speaker
how
about
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
only
when
the
victim
was
white
or
of
the
different
race?
unknown
speaker
the
court
is
now
adjourned
we
will
resume
tomorrow
morning
in
10
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
mr.
west
what
is
that,
the
new
statute
and
would
any
defendant
ask
for
it?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
and
whether
or
not
there
are
any
witnesses,
you
do
no
have
to
suggest
--
unknown
speaker
the
witnesses
are
going
to
be?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
scope
of
the
constitutional,
a
rule
should
be?
unknown
speaker
our
constitutionally
entitled
to
the
question?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the
defendant
is
not
a
member
of
the
minority
group?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
racial.
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
--
suppose
the
defendant
is
not
a
member
of
the
minority
he
asks
for
that
the
jury
be
interrogated
about
racial
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
saying
--
unknown
speaker
so,
you
really,
so
you
say
it
is
not
limited
to
where
the
defendant
is
a
member
of
the
minority
group?
unknown
speaker
now
where
does
it
stop.
any
defendant
at
any
time,
i
take
it
then
could
be
constitutionally
entitled
to
have
the
jury
interrogated
about
racial
prejudice,
if
he
ask
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
then
the
judge
has
to
be
acquainted,
because
what
may
develop
during
the
trial
as
to
the
identity
of
the
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
might
be
maybe
a
white
accused
but
to
maybe,
you
have
a
black
witness?
unknown
speaker
but
the
judge
and
defense
counsel
has
first
to
tell
the
judge,
listen
and
then
the
judge
has
to
make
a
preliminary
determination,
as
i
understand
your
brief.
that
questions
jurors
who
may
have
prejudices?
unknown
speaker
but
the
defense
counsel
has
a
burden?
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
you
limit
the
right
to
a
member
of
the
minority?
i
suppose
you
would
say
any
defendant,
white
or
black.
unknown
speaker
could
have
the
instruction,
but
how
about
the
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
but
the
defense
can
not
get
it
by
asking
for
it
because
i
understand
what
you
brief
says
you
do
not
quote
the
full
statute.
but
the
judge
has
to
be
satisfied
that
some
jurors
may
have
prejudices?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
i
am
getting
at
it
is
i
understand
that
statute.
there
is
a
burden
on
the
defense.
persuade
the
judge
that
this
is
a
situation
and
this
trial
will
involve
situations
where
jurors
may
have
prejudices.
unknown
speaker
and,
until
he
persuades
him
of
that,
the
judge
has
no
duties.
i
understand
it
to
permit
these
questions.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
all
of
you
would
say
--
to
persuade
the
judge,
you
would
say
you
would
not
have
to
show
any
more
other
than
the
witness,
as
black?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
you
have
to
show.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
to
show
anymore,
i
take
it
you
question
the
constitutionality
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
almost
a
per
se
rule
then?
as
i
understand
you,
all
you
have
to
say,
the
judges,
the
defense
is
going
to
have
a
black
witness
and
then
he
must
permit
the
questions
unknown
speaker
when
they
ask
of
the.
on
that
basis
you
says,
i
do
not
know
what
you
would
not
say
that
as
long
as
the
jury
is
mixed,
you
must
ask
the
jury
this
question
because
witnesses
are
either
going
to
be
white
or
black.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
limit
it
to
violent
crime?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
are
taking
the
position
here
that
it
should
be
limited
to
violent
crime.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
demonstrations
convictions
for
disturbing
the
peace
to
those
who
have
no
violent
overtones
and
yet
certainly
during
the
60’s,
there
were
occasional
racial
implications
of
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
satisfy
as
your
personal
preferences.
unknown
speaker
this
new
statute.
apparently
the
new
statute
is
not
limited
to
a
cases
of
prosecutions
from
violent
crime,
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
i
also
understand
that
as
you
told
us
earlier
that
it
is
a
per
se
rule.
once
you
say
we
have
a
black
witness
or
you
suggest
it
to
justice
white,
if
you
have
a
mixed
jury,
black
and
white,
are
then,
automatically
the
judge
has
to
ask
the
question.
he
has
not
discretion.
unknown
speaker
or
you
would
want
him
to
ask
him
without
a
request
from
defense
counsel?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
west,
you
continue
to
talk
in
terms
of
racial
prejudice
there
can
be
all
sorts
of
prejudice,
disassociated
with
reyes,
it
was
not
down
any
years
ago
that
a
republican
in
mississippi
but
not
the
most
popular
fellow,
or
today,
a
member
of
the
irish
republican
army
might
find
himself
unwelcome
in
some
communities,
would
you
extend
the
constitutional
rule
to
any
situation
in
which
arguably
there
might
be
prejudice
against
particular
defendant
or
a
particular
witness
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
get
that
one?
unknown
speaker
you
said
reversal
or
you
meant
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
has
a
procedure
been
developed
for
the
administration
of
the
statute
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
you,
i
think
in
an
answer
to
this
question,
we
were
told
that
the
statute
itself
is
not
here
in
the
papers,
but
is
it
paraphrased
anywhere
or
described—
