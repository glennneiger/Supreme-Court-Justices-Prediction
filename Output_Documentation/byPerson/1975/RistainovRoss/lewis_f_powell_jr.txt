justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
here
on
the
certiorari
from
the
united
states
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
respondent,
a
negro,
was
prosecuted
in
the
massachusetts's
state
court
for
a
violent
crime
against
a
white
security
guard.
the
trial
judge
questioned
veniremen
on
voir
dire
as
to
general
bias
or
prejudice
but
declined
to
put
a
question
specifically
addressed
to
racial
prejudice.
following
conviction
and
affirmance
in
the
state
courts,
respondent
was
granted
relief
by
a
district
court
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
relying
on
our
decision
in
ham
against
south
carolina
but
ham
does
not
hold
that
the
constitution
requires
in
every
criminal
case,
involving
parties
or
witnesses
of
different
races
that
specific
questions
as
to
racial
prejudice,
be
asked
of
venireman.
ham
involved
a
highly
inflammatory
situation,
where
the
defendant
claimed
he
had
been
framed
on
account
of
his
race.
we
view
the
circumstances,
in
this
case,
including
the
care
exercised
by
the
massachusetts
trial
court
in
seeking
an
impartial
jury
to
be
quite
different
from
ham.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
filed
a
statement
concurring
in
the
result,
mr.
justice
marshall
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
