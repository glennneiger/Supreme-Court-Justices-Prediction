justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
statutory
to
i
think
which
came
as
a
surprise
to
me
coming
from
a
western
state
but
we
will
take
a
day
or
two
to
making
a
jury--
are
there
just
so
many
questions
that
are
put
in
their
prescribing
a
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
smith,
what
does
general
prejudice
means,
is
that
a
term
under
massachusetts
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
that
the
juror
raises
his
hand?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
but
in
the
case
of
one
juror,
we
know
he
said
that
he
was
racially
prejudiced.
do
we
have
any
indication
of
what
those
of
whom
you
described
as
being
excused
for
general
prejudice’s
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mrs.
smith,
you-you
kind
of
tried
to
have
both,
both
pieces
of
the
cake,
don’t
you.
because
earlier
you
say
that
by
vacating
and
not
reversing
we
indicated
that
we
didn’t
think
this
was
directly
applicable.
and
yet
know
you
say
that
because
vacated
a
kind
of
inconsistent
consequence
follows
or
that
that
the
first
circuit’s
view
of
inconsistent
consequence
followed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
suggest
there
is
a
possibility
perhaps
that
is
embraced
neither
by
your
view
nor
by
that
of
the
first
circuit,
and
that
is
that
when
we
have
these
holes
we
just
frequently
vacate
without
perhaps,
quite
that
much
fine-tuning
as
is
to
the
result.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
what
has
been
the
attitude
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
treating
voir
dire,
does
that
encourage
trial
judges
to
go
outside
of
the
statutory
questions,
or
does
it
leave
it
completely
up
to
their
discretion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about,
how
about
before
that
for
purposes
of
retroactivity
analysis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
witness
being
black,
say
in
a
white
community?
or
being
white
in
a
largely
black
community?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
have
those,
say
a
white
defendant
in
a
largely
white
community
but
the
white
defendant
proposes
to
call
a
black
witness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
an
absolute
rule
as
you
suggest,
then
it
isn’t
just
limited
to
cases
of
black
defendants.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
west,
i
wrote
ham
and
we
did
not
approve
those
cases.
we
sighted
them
and
we
made
it
quite
clear
in
ham
that
the
principle
was
based
on
equal
protection
clause
and
the
racial
implications
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
then
would
you
explain
our
rejection
of
the
voir
dire
request
with
respect
to
beers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
so
limiting,
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
say
that
the
case
itself
stands
for
anything
more
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
the
language
it
says
that
referring
to
all
and
read
it,
it
says
the
courts
opinion
relied
upon
a
number
of
state
court
holdings
throughout
the
country,
to
the
same
effect.
but,
it
was
not
expressed
and
grounded
upon
any
constitutional
requirement.
now,
i
take
it
at
some
of
the
state
cases
were
grounded
in
a
constitutional
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
aldrich
could
not
possibly
have
itself
have
approved
those
cases
because
it
did
not
rest
on
the
constitutional
ground.
