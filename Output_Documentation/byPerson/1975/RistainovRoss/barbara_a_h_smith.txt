ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barbara
a.
h.
smith,
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
i
represent
the
petitioners
theodore
ristaino
and
frank
hall
in
this
case.
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
began
in
june
of
1970,
when
james
ross
and
two
co-defendants
were
brought
to
trial
in
the
superior
court
of
massachusetts,
upon
indictments
charging
armed
robbery,
assault
and
battery
with
a
dangerous
weapon
and
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
prior
to
trial,
counsel
for
the
defendant
james
ross
as
well
as
counsel
for
the
co-defendants
requested
that
the
trial
judge
impose
certain
questions
to
the
perspective
jurors
upon
voir
dire.
one
of
the
seven
questions
proposed
by
council
for
ross
touched
upon
the
issue
of
possible
racial
bias.
the
question
was,
are
there
any
of
you
who
would
believe
that
a
white
person
is
more
likely
to
tell
the
truth
than
a
black
person.
the
trial
judge
declined
to
pose
any
of
these
questions.
following
trial
at
which
the
defendants
did
not
testify
or
offer
a
defense,
they
were
convicted.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
a
general
question
as
to
this,
whether
the
jurors
were
sensible
of
any
bias
or
prejudice
was
propounded
to
the
jurors.
this
was
coupled
with
instructions
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
first
question
to
be
posed
by
the
jury.
that
is
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
is
as
opposed
to
the
ham
case,
did
not
simply
say,
i
have
the
clerk
answer
the
question,
are
you
sensible
to
any
bias
or
prejudice
but
in
an
effort
to
focus
their
attention
on
what
this
question
meant,
he
did
explain
the
instructions
as
this
panel
of
voir
dire.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
on
pages
thirteen,
beginning
on
page
twelve
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
and
thirteen
and
set
out.
the
entire
voir
dire
procedure
is
set
out
in
the
appendix.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
as
a
whole,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
you
honor.
and
anything
additional
is
left
within
the
digression
of
the
trial
judge.
i
may
continue
with
procedural
history.
following
conviction,
the
supreme
judicial
court
affirmed
that
conviction,
ross
then
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
course
raising
the
issue
of
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
ask
a
proposed
question.
on
january
22nd
1973
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
summarily
vacated
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
ham
versus
south
carolina,
which
this
court
decided
five
days
previously.
upon
remand
the
supreme
judicial
court
addressed
the
issue
of
whether
the
ham
decision
required
reversal
on
that
ground
that
the
trial
judge
refused
to
ask
perspective
jurors
questions
concerning
possible
racial
prejudice,
and
again
they
affirmed.
ross
then
filed
the
second
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
with
justice’s
marshall,
brennan
and
douglas
dissenting.
in
january
of
1974,
ross
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court,
in
district
of
massachusetts.
in
june
of
1974,
the
court
ordered
that
the
writ
shall
issue,
based
upon
the
theory
of
the
trial
judge
to
ask
the
proposed
questions.
the
respondent
below
ristaino
appealed
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
visiting
judge
moore
from
the
second
circuit
dissenting.
a
petition
for
certiorari
on
behalf
of
ristaino
was
then
filed
in
this
court
and
granted
in
may
of
1975.
the
principle
issue
in
this
case
involves
the
conflicting
interpretations,
accorded
this
court’s
decision
in
ham
versus
south
carolina
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and
the
federal
district
court
and
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
these
interpretations
involved
the
scope
and
the
applicability
of
the
ham
decision,
and
a
resulting
retroactive
or
prospective
application
to
be
accorded
at
that
decision
even
in
fact
the
federal
court’s
interpretation
is
correct.
on
remand,
supreme
court
of
massachusetts,
considered
this
case
in
the
light
of
the
ham
decision
and
held
this
to
the
scope
with
the
ham
decision.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
ham
case
announced
a
new
broad
constitutional
principle
requiring
the
questions
designed
to
discover
possible
racial
prejudice,
be
put
to
perspective
jurors
in
all
state
criminal
trials
when
the
defendant
is
black.
such
questions
are
constitutionally
required
only
when
the
defendant
is
a
special
target
for
racial
prejudice.
as
to
complying
with
fundamental
fairness
the
court
found
that
the
judges
questions
and
the
instructions
to
the
perspective
jurors,
were
under
the
circumstances
of
the
ross
case,
commensurate
with
fourteenth
amendment
requirements.
however,
the
federal
district
court
held
that
the
petitioner
ross
had
a
constitutional
right
to
have
the
issue
of
racial
prejudice
specifically
call
to
the
attention
of
the
perspective
jurors
on
the
voir
dire
examination,
and
on
that
basis
ordered
that
the
writ
issue.
the
first
circuit
held
in
substance
that
where
the
defendant
is
black
and
charged
with
a
violent
crime
against
a
white,
in
this
particular
case
a
security
officer,
failure
to
ask
specific
questions
is
error
of
constitutional
dimension
requiring
release
of
a
convicted
defendant.
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
supreme
judicial
court’s
interpretations
of
the
scope
of
ham
is
correct
for
following
reasons.
in
ham
this
court
was
presented
with
a
very
novel
fact
pattern.
jean
ham
was
a
young,
bearded,
black
civil
rights
activist,
he
was
well
known
in
the
community
from
south
carolina,
he
was
well
known
for
his
civil
rights
activities.
his
sole
defense
was
that
he
had
been
framed,
and
that
law
enforcement
officers
were
out
to
get
him
because
of
his
civil
rights
activities.
thus,
the
court
was
presented
a
case
in
which
race
was
a
consideration,
in
which
the
credibility
of
dark
defendant
was
directly
pitted
against
the
white
law
enforcement
officers
who
he
maintain
were
out
to
get
him
and
framing
him.
within
this
factual
framework,
the
trial
judge
in
ham,
refused
to
pose
the
questions
requested.
and
nor
did
he
give
any
instructions
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
general
question,
as
to
bias
or
prejudice.
now
the
majority
opinion
in
ham
utilized
very
specific
language,
this
court
held
in
this
case
under
the
facts
shown
by
this
record,
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
required
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
have
the
jurors
interrogated
on
the
issue
of
racial
bias.
petitioners
suggest
that
this
language
is
not
to
be
dismissed
as
mere
common
judicial
locutions,
as
did
the
federal
district
court.
but
this
court
meant
what
exactly
what
it
said,
that
the
court
traditionally
uses
such
words
of
limitation
when
they
are
rendering
a
decision
which
is
required
by
the
particular
fact
pattern
presented
to
them,
when
they
are
rendering
a
decision
solely
within
the
confines
of
the
due
process
clause,
fundamental
fairness.
we
would
suggest
that
this
court
neither
held
nor
suggested
that
the
constitution
conferred
a
right
in
every
case
to
have
this
specific
question
address
the
possible
racial
prejudice
put
to
perspective
jurors
we
further
suggest
that
by
basing
its
decision
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
rather
than
the
six
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
jury
as
urged
by
petitioner
ham
in
his
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
the
brief
to
this
court.
that
the
court
indicated
its
intention
to
limit
its
decision
to
cases
involving
special
circumstances,
as
did
the
case
in
ham.
finally,
we
would
suggest
that
this
court’s
action
on
ross’
initial
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
indicates
that
its
rule
in
ham
was
in
fact
limited
to
a
particular
fact
pattern,
and
that
no
new
per
se
constitutional
rule
was
there
in
announced.
for
this
court
vacated
the
ross
decision
and
remanded,
it
did
not
reverse
outright,
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
vacation
was
made
so
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
could
reconsider
the
fact
pattern
in
ross
within
light
of
ham.
petitioners
therefore
suggest
that
the
scope
of
the
ham
decision
is
limited
to
those
cases
involving
circumstances
with
the
probability
of
prejudice.
it
is
not
sufficient
to
mention
to
require
a
deviation
from
the
normal
voir
dire
procedure,
which
is
traditionally
left
within
the
digression
of
the
trial
judge.
we
would
suggest
that
the
voir
dire
procedure
employed
in
this
case
complied
with
fundamental
fairness,
as
required
by
the
due
process
clause.
in
course
of
the
discussion
between
counsel
and
the
trial
judge
as
to
whether
this
questions
would
be
asked.
the
trial
judge
asked
the
counsel
for
a
co-defendant
whether
there
was
anything
peculiar
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
response
was
no,
just
as
the
victim
is
white
and
the
defendants
are
black.
counsel
for
ross
brought
no
peculiar
or
special
circumstances
with
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
further,
the
trial
judge
indicated
he
would
give
preliminary
instructions
on
the
meaning
of
the
first
question
to
be
asked
by
the
clerk.
in
substance
then
instruction
was
that
each
of
the
jurors
must
remember
they
were
under
oath,
that
they
had
an
absolute
duty
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
based
upon
the
evidence
heard
in
the
courtroom,
not
on
any
extraneous
factors,
no
bias,
or
prejudice
of
any
kind.
that
the
clerk
in
asking
the
first
question
would
be
given
an
opportunity
to
inform
the
court
if
you
cannot
or
if
you
serious
doubt
that
you
can
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict.
he
directed
them
to
examine
all
aspects
of
the
case,
quoting;
everything
you
know
about
the
case,
both
in
the
courtroom
from
what
i
have
said.
if
any
doubt,
you
have
the
duty
to
inform
the
court
by
standing
or
raising
your
hand.
the
defendants
were
then
asked
to
stand,
so
clearly
the
jurors
were
aware
that
they
were
in
fact
black.
in
fact,
a
number
of
jurors
did
raise
their
hands
and
indicate
their
inability
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
one
for
admitted
racial
prejudice,
two
for
general
prejudice,
seven
for
previously
formed
opinion,
seven
because
their
relationship
with
law
enforcement
authorities,
and
one
because
of
employment
at
the
university
where
the
crime
originally
occurred.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
general
prejudice?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
question
is
are
you
conscious
of
any
bias
or
prejudice?
not
general,
no.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
and
then
is
question--
approaches
the
bench
and
states
to
the
judge
the
reason
he
feels
that
he
could
not
render
an
impartial
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor.
the
language
was
vague,
just
that
i
know
enough
about
this
case
i
couldn’t
mender
an
impartial
verdict,
something
to
that
effect.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would.
in
a
further
effort
to—
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
there
was
no
allegation
in
this
case
of
any
extensive
free
trial
publicity;
nothing
in
the
record
indicates
that
it
was
an
extraordinary
case
in
any
way.
and
one
further
effort
to
keep
the
element
of
racial
prejudice
from
the
jurors,
the
trial
judge
declined
to
use
the
muslim
names
of
the
two
co-defendants
of
james
ross.
therefore
i
submit
that
the
procedure
employed
in
this
case
complied
with
fundamental
fairness,
that
ham
requires
nothing
more
than
that
the
jurors
attentions
are
focused
on
the
possibility
of
bias
or
prejudice.
therefore,
if
the
voir
dire
proceeding
complied
with
fundamental
fairness,
the
court
below
erred
in
vacating
the
state
conviction
absent
of
demonstration
of
actual
likelihood
of
prejudice;
flowing
from
the
trial
judge’s
refusal
to
ask
the
proposed
questions.
this
case
came
in
the
federal
court
collateral
review
of
a
state
court
conviction
pursuant
to
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
therefore,
the
actual
likelihood
of
prejudice
must
be
demonstrated.
those
cases,
which
have
held
to
the
contrary,
would
suggest
involved
in
every
instance
circumstances,
which
were
such
as
to
create
a
serious
probability
of
unfairness.
in
the
instant
case
no
such
circumstances
have
been
demonstrated,
and
the
petitioners
submit
that
it
was
error
for
the
federal
court
to
void
the
state
conviction,
merely
upon
speculation
or
the
mere
possibility
of
prejudice
flowing
from
the
refusal
to
ask
this
one
question.
if
however,
the
ham
case
did
enunciate
a
new
broad
constitutional
mandate
or
per
se
rule,
requiring
that
questions
specifically
address
to
racial
prejudice
be
posed
in
every
instance
in
which
the
defendant
is
black.
the
question
of
the
prospective
or
retrospective
application
to
be
accorded
that
rule
must
be
answered.
we
submit
that
the
first
circuit’s
resolution
of
this
question
is
without
support.
as
i
stated
early,
or
the
first
circuit
held
it
by
vacating
and
remanding
the
ross
case
for
reconsideration,
this
court
impliedly
held
the
rule
of
ham
to
retroactive.
we
suggest
that
the
only
inference
to
be
drawn
from
this
court’s
action
is
that
ham
was
limited
to
its
facts
and
would
require
a
case
by
case
examination
based
on
that
particular
fact
or
pattern
involved.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
believe
that
is
consistent
with
what
i
have
said
before,
your
honor.
i
think
what
your
court,
this
court’s
action
in
vacating
indicates
was
limit
to
the
particular
fact
pattern.
the
first
circuit
inferred
that
one,
the
court
had
enunciated
across
the
board
per
se
rule
and
by
vacating
held
this
new
rule
to
be
retroactive.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
under
that
circumstance
and,
your
honor,
i
would
still
say
that
there
is
little
support
for
the
first
circuit’s
determination
that
you
were
making
a
ruling
on
retroactivity,
by
your
action
in
your
first
petition.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
right,
your
honor,
that
is
my
position.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think—
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
true,
your
honor.
if
there
is
a
new
rule
to
announce
in
this
case,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
a
procedural
rule
only.
that
is
not
a
rule
designed
to
guarantee
that
defendant
has
specifically
enumerated
constitutional
right.
there
was
not
a
rule
based
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
jury,
but
it
is
designed
only
to
expand
the
voir
dire
procedure
which
is
not
in
self
constitutionally
required.
therefore
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
granting
more
extensive
application
to
a
rule
enunciated
in
ham,
if
in
fact
the
rule
was
so
enunciated,
then
given
to
those
decisions,
which
did
in
fact
rest
upon
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
jury.
and
therefore
the
decision
on
this
question
falls
within
the
cases
of
de
stefano
versus
wood,
holding
duncan
versus
louisiana,
and
bloom
versus
illinois
granting
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
serious
criminal
contempt
to
be
prospective
only.
and
daniel
versus
louisiana,
holding
the
terry
versus
louisiana,
was
not
to
be
applied
retroactively
to
convictions
obtained
by
jurors
and
panel
prior
to
the
date
of
that
decision.
first
instance
we
suggest
that
the
purpose
behind
the
taylor
rule
and
the
de
stefano
rule
or
duncan
rule,
goes
no
further
than
the
rule
announced
in
ham.
in
taylor,
the
court
stated
its
purpose
was
to
prevent
arbitrariness,
repression
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution.
there
is
nothing
--no
greater
purpose
founded
for
the
rule
in
ham
case.
second,
the
reliance
factor
is
equally
as
great
as
in
the
both
cited
cases.
the
sole
proposer
of
this
rule
is
found
in
aldridge
versus
united
states,
which
was
decided
solely
within
this
court’s
jurisdiction
over
the
lower
federal
courts
over
44
years
ago.
since
that
time
there
has
been
no
indication
that
the
constitution
mandated
the
interjection
of
racial
prejudice
issue
into
a
procedure
traditionally
resting
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
since
these
cases
have
a
reason,
it
has
indicated
to
the
courts
that
the
better
practice
is
to
allow
the
question
to
be
put
if
the
defendant
so
requests.
however,
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
before
that
it
was
traditionally
very
limited
to
the
three
specified
questions
that
are
set
out
in
my
briefs.
that
it
was
a
rare,
very
rare
instance
when
the
trial
judge
went
outside
of
that.
and
then
only
when
shown
that
particular
circumstances
involved
in
the
case
required
that
these
questions
be
asked.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
are
set
out
page
12
of
my
brief,
whether
he
was
related
to
either
party
or
has
any
interest
in
the
case,
or
has
expressed
or
formed
an
opinion,
or
sensible
of
any
bias
or
prejudice.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
a
additional
question
that
the
trial
judge
did
agree
to
put
in
this
case,
at
the
request
of
counsel,
because
the
victim
had
been
a
white
security
guard,
he
did
agree
to
ask
the
jurors,
if
they
were
involved
with
law
enforcement
authorities.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
because
of
the
circumstances
of
having
a
quasi
-
law
enforcement,
official
being
--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
clerk
answered
questions,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
never
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
oh
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes
he
is,
first
in
this
case
he
gave
the
general
instructions
and,
rather
specific
instructions
as
to
the
duty
of
the
jurors.
then
the
clerk
reads
the
questions,
then
if
a
juror
wants
to
respond
he
raises
his
hand
and
comes
up
to
the
bench
for
a
bench
conference
with
the
judge.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
to
my
knowledge,
it
is
always
the
clerk
who
does
it.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
differs,
in
this
case
some
of
the
panels
were
rather
small
because
it
was,
at
least
i
believe
five
panels
questioned.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
i
don’t
believe
he
would
not.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
believe
it—
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
it
shows
that
some
of
the
jurors
had
said
on
previous
cases.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
and
in
a
number
of
instances
they
were
then
excused
because
they
have
been
locked
up
and
it
is
a
lock
up
situation
in
this
case.
i
can't
say
definitely
how
long?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
your
honor,
i
don’t.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
don't
know
in
this
county
what
the
terms.
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
other
point,
and
that
is
the
effect
that
the
retroactive
application
would
be
substantial
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
commonwealth.
and
in
fact
the
chief
justice
himself
stayed
in
the
case
of
commonwealth
versus
lumley
that
it
would
be
calamitous
indeed.
thank
you.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
address
the
court
on
the
new
statute
to
which
is
mr.
west
is
referred
too.
that
statute
requires
that
the
trial
judge
make
a
determination,
whether
the
circumstances
of
the
case
require
that
the
questions
be
posed.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
pardon
me?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
not
to
my
knowledge.
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
mr.
west
i
believe,
has
referred
to
it
in
his
brief.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
would
be
very
happy
to
send
the
copy,
i
will
and
give
that
to
you
now
if
you
like.
that
was
the
only
further
comment.
