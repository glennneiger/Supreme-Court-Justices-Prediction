mr.
michael
g.
west
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
michael
west,
and
by
appointment
of
this
court
i
represent
the
respondent
james
ross
jr.,
in
these
proceedings.
if
i
may
before
formal
argument,
there
are
two
misprints
in
my
brief
and
i
would
like
to
bring
those
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
first
is
on
page
four,
under
the
statement
of
the
case,
where
it
indicates
that
james
ross
was
convicted
and
received
terms,
it
said
of
18
to
20
years
in
this
state
prison,
actually
it
was
18
to
30
years.
and
lastly
on
page
42,
and
that
is
the
second
line,
i
refer
to
chapter
234
section
228,
it
is
actually
section
28.
mr.
michael
g.
west
your
honor,
this
brief
was
printed
by
authority
of
the
court
by
your
own
printers.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
g.
west
since
apparently
is
this
court’s
practice
when
presented
with
a
case
dealing
with
both
retroactivity
and
the
application
of
a
constitutional
principle,
and
to
deal
with
the
retroactivity
issue
first,
i
shall
do
that
in
my
argument
dealing
with
the
retrospective
application
of
ham
versus
south
carolina
to
the
ross
situation.
the
test
stated
by
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
is
found
in
stovall
versus
deno,
and
that
sets
out
a
three-prong
test.
setting
out
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
standards,
the
effect
upon
the
reliance
of
the
old
standards,
and
the
effect
upon
the
administration
of
justice.
believe
this
test
was
further
clarified
in
the
desist
versus
the
united
states.
in
that
the
three-prong,
of
the
three-prong
test.
the
first
prong,
and
that
is
the
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
new
rule
is
to
be
given
foremost
importance.
and
then
in
william
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
said
that
if
the
major
purpose
of
the
constitutional
rule
goes
to
the
truth
finding
function
and
substantially
affects
the
accuracy
of
the
guilty
verdicts.
then
with
the
rule
be
given
complete
retroactive
application,
without
regard
to
the
effect
on
the
administration
justice
or
the
good
faith
reliance
by
the
court
below.
now
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
the
issue
of
retroactivity
of
ham
was
never
raised
by
the
commonwealth,
in
either
the
second
supreme
judicial
court
case
after
remand
by
this
court,
or
by
the
first
circuit
in
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
based
on
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
it
was
raised
in
the
first
circuit
only
as
a
side
and
never
briefed
by
the
commonwealth.
i
think
what
this
indicates,
is
that
the
commonwealth
first
of
all
assumed
retroactivity
of
the
ham
case
and
second
i
think
it
dilutes
their
claim
of
the
calamitous
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice.
because
that
issue
was
never
raised,
never
briefed
in
any
of
the
court
except
this
one.
in
fact
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
the
commonwealth
in
the
recent
case
of
commonwealth
versus
lumley,
states
that
they
believe
the
limited
rule
announced
by
ham
is
to
be
given
complete
retroactive
application.
ross
believes
that
the
denial
of
the
impartial
jury
or
even
the
likelihood
of
an
impartial
jury
or
the
denial
of
an
impartial
jury,
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
truth-finding
function.
and
so
effects
the
accuracy
of
guilty
verdicts
that
ham
should
be
given
complete
retrospective
application.
the
commonwealth
relies
on
two
cases
in
this
regard;
one
is
daniels
versus
louisiana
and
the
second
is
de
stefano
versus
woods,
to
establish
the
argument
that
ham
is
not
the
be
give
retrospective
application.
now
the
question
presented
in
daniels
was
the
retrospective
application
of
taylor
versus
louisiana.
this
court
denied
retroactive
application
of
taylor,
saying
that
until
taylor
no
cases
held
that
the
exclusion
of
women
from
a
jury
deprive
the
defendant
of
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
trial.
that
is
not
true
here,
there
was
no
previous
case?
this
court
said
that
reliance
on
past
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
hoyt
versus
florida,
precluded
retroactive
application.
here
there
is
no
previous
decision
to
the
contrary,
in
fact
the
previous
decision
to
ham,
aldridge
versus
united
states,
was
in
support
of
the
ross
claim.
they
also
say—you
also
said
in
taylor
that
the
substantial
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
and
it
would
cause
enormous
burdens
for
the
state.
the
commonwealth
in
its
brief
on
page
nine
says
that
therefore
the
retroactive
application
of
the
ham
case
would
require
reversal
of
every
case
in
the
commonwealth,
involving
a
defendant
who
is
a
member
of
the
minority
class.
that
is
not
just
correct.
in
this
regard,
the
first
circuit
decision
in
ross
is
much
narrower
than
the
commonwealth
asserts.
first,
it
only
applies
to
black
defendants.
second,
only
black
defendants
who
are
convicted
of
a
violent
crime,
and
third
it
only
applies
to
jury
trials.
fourth,
it
only
provides
for
a
application
where
the
judge
or
the
clerk
asks
questions,
it
is
not
where
a
counsel
does.
it
is
my
research
that
approximately
in
those
effects,
approximately
17
states.
and
only
when
the
defendant's
counsel
has
submitted
a
question
as
to
racial
prejudice,
and
the
court
had
denied
that
question.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well
it
doesn’t
say
that,
but
certainly
that
is
the
ross
case,
and
only
of
a
violent
crime.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well
that
in
fact
is
the
ross
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
only
witness
against
ross
was
no
the
victim,
he
could
not
identify
ross
at
all,
it
was
only
a
white
gas
station
attendant
who
was
the
witness
against
ross.
and
so
i
think
the
first
circuit
decision
would
certainly
apply
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well
i
think
that
would
still
apply,
your
honor.
i
think
decisions
of
your
court
have
indicated
that
the
color
of
the
petitioner
does
not
affect
the
decision
whether
to
allow
or
not
to
allow
the
questions
to
be
asked
or
challenge
to
the
jury,
such
as
in
peters
versus
kiff.
mr.
michael
g.
west
no,
you
are
right,
your
honor.
but
it
would
certainly
be
limited
to
in
this
first
circuit
to
violent
crimes,
they
feel
that
the
--
mr.
michael
g.
west
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
g.
west
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court,
good
morning.
just
prior
to
yesterday’s
recess,
i
was
discussing
this
court’s
decision
in
daniels
versus
louisiana.
which
held
taylor
versus
louisiana
not
retroactive
and
in
particular,
that
part
of
the
daniels
case
dealing
with
the
effect
upon
the
criminal
justice
system.
if
taylor
were
held
to
be
retroactive.
ross’s
contention
is
that
the
retroactive
application
of
ham,
no
doubt
will
some
effect
on
the
criminal
justice
system
within
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
but
not
the
calamitous
effect,
urged
on
this
court
by
the
commonwealth.
we
also
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
in
ross
does
not
have
the
wide
ramification
suggested
by
the
commonwealth.
yesterday,
i
mentioned
the
couple
of
those
limitations,
but
one
that
i
would
like
to
mention
now
and
what
triggers
the
ross
doctrine
in
asking
questions
as
to
racial
prejudice
is
that
the
defense
counsel
must
submit
questions
to
the
trial
judge
to
ask
the
perspective
jurors.
failure
to
do
that
and
failure
of
the
trial
judge
to
refuse
those
questions,
or
similar
questions
to
the
same
effect,
will
not
bring
the
doctrine
in
ham
or
ross
into
existence.
also,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
order
to
challenge
one’s
conviction
based
upon
the
ham
case,
a
criminal
defendant
probably
would
still
have
to
be
in
jail.
there
has
been
--
36
months
have
pass
since
the
ham
decision.
presumably,
all
states
except
massachusetts
has
followed
the
ham
decision
and
even
in
massachusetts,
in
the
second
ross
decision,
the
supreme
judicial
court
although
affirming
ross’s
conviction
said
that
in
future
cases,
it
is
good
policy
to
ask
these
questions
as
to
racial
prejudice,
although
not
constitutionally
required.
and
in
addition,
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
has
twice,
since
the
second
ross
decision
in
may
of
1973
revise
the
statute
upon
which
this
suit
is
predicated
to
for
now
provide
that
the
trial
judge
must
ask
or
shall
ask,
questions
as
to
racial
prejudice
to
the
perspective
jurors.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
in
addition,
it
appears
that
the
statute
says
and
it
is
on
page
42
of
my
brief.
mr.
michael
g.
west
no.
mr.
michael
g.
west
no.
only
if
the
court
believes
that
this
possible
pre-conceived
opinions
towards
the
credibility
of
certain
classes
of
persons,
they
do
not
limit
it
to
racial
prejudice.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
i
think
that
it
is
at
least
--
mr.
michael
g.
west
certainly,
defendants
of
racial
minority
are
clearly
covered
in
my
opinion.
also,
i
would
take
the
position
of
the
dissent
in
the
ham
case
and
that
is
that
questions
that
arises
to
a
serious
nature
of
prejudices
should
also
be
included
such
as
the
beard
in
the
ham
case.
such
as
someone’s
religious
preference.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
it
depends
on
the
case
your
honor.
for
example,
if
the
case
involved
capital
punishment?
i
think
that
it
would
be
constitutionally
required
to
ask.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
mr.
michael
g.
west
i
think
in
that
case,
it
is
up
to
the
trial
judge
to
find
out
if
there
is
any
possible
racial
prejudice
in
that
case.
for
example.
mr.
michael
g.
west
the
victims
or
the
defendant,
or
the
witness
--
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
i
answered
it
yesterday
for
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
michael
g.
west
if
he
asks
for
it
and
if
the
nature
of
the
case,
at
all
suggests
that
the
question
of
black
and
white
is
part
of
that
case.
either
if
the
defendant
or
the
victim
or
a
witness
is
of
another
racial
minority.
i
think
in
those
cases,
it
is
constitutionally
required.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right
and
if
failure
of
the
defense
counsel
to
submit
any
questions,
automatically
does
not
trigger
either
the
ham
doctrine
apparently,
or
the
ross
doctrine
of
the
first
circuit.
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right,
and
that
is
exactly
the
ross
case
because
there
were
not
only
one
question
submitted
by
ross
but
co-counsel
or
co-defendants
counsel
submitted
approximately
30
questions.
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes,
and
in
fact
i
think
there
is
a
further
burden,
not
only
to
submit
that
and
to
convince
the
judge
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
prejudice,
but
in
ross
case,
i
think
the
judge
was
sort
of
convinced
of
that,
that
they
maybe
some
prejudice
except
he
felt
that
asking
these
questions
would
not
be
helpful.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
mr.
michael
g.
west
i
would
think
so
your
honor
and
i
think
the—
mr.
michael
g.
west
that
is
right
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
doing
here
because
these—
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
i
think
those
questions
are
constitutionally
required
particularly
however
in
cases
of
violent
crimes.
at
the
moment,
i
am
prepared
to
limit
the
--
my
per
se
rule
to
violent
crime
because
those
apparently
are
crimes
in
which
racial
prejudice
most
stands
out.
mr.
michael
g.
west
i
do
not
believe
so
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
in
the
appendix
either.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
first
of
all,
the
first
circuit
limited
to
violent
crimes.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
my
personal
preference
would
be
for
all
crimes.
but,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
i
think
i
would
limit
to
violent
crimes
because
those
have
the
most
potential
for
racial
prejudice.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
as
i
said,
my
personal
preference
would
be
to
have
it
for
all
crimes
such
as
the
ham
case
was
certainly
not
a
violent
crime.
mr.
michael
g.
west
possession
of
marijuana.
mr.
michael
g.
west
which
statute
your
honor?
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
it
is
not.
it
does
not
satisfy
me
however
because
in
reading
the
new
statute,
it
has
to
be
triggered
by
the
judge,
meaning
the
judge
has
to
be
persuaded
that
there
are
some
factors.
and,
i
would
like
to
take
that
discretion
from
the
judge
and
trigger
this
question.
mr.
michael
g.
west
no,
he
has
to
ask
the
question
if
defense
counsel
requests
it.
mr.
michael
g.
west
no,
no,
no.
i
would
limit
that
to
only
when
defense
counsel
asked
those
questions.
i
think
that
is
the
strategy
decision
of
defense
counsel
whether
to
inject
that
issue
into
the
trial.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes,
in
my
opinion
it
would.
mr.
michael
g.
west
i
think
those
technical
witnesses
have
severe
impacts
on
juries,
and
i
would
certainly
include
that
type
of
a
witness
in
my
discussion.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
i
think
certainly—i
would
even
do
it
in
that
case
because
the
birth
certificate
may
well
be
a
crucial
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes.
i
understand
that.
mr.
michael
g.
west
i
think
i
am
and
i
think
that
in
issues
of
racial
prejudice
when
must
paint
with
a
broad
brush
because
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
purpose
behind
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
stop
invidious
discrimination,
and
i
think
that
when
you
give
judge's
discretion
in
this
area,
you
wind
up
with
cases
like
the
ross
case,
limited
to
special
circumstances
or
when
one
is
the
special
target
for
racial
prejudice.
and,
i
think
that
i
would
rather
air
on
the
side
of
the
being
broader
in
this
area,
than
being
limited
and
restricted
as
i
think
the
supreme
judicial
court
was.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
i
cannot
be
sure.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes,
i
would.
and,
the
decision
of
yours
in
ham
approves
those
state
cases
upon
which
all
which
relied.
and,
some
of
the
state
cases
deal
with
of—i
remember
one
of
them
dealt
with
a
political
party,
the
no-nothing-party.
i
think
it
was
people
versus
reyes.
although,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
name
of
the
case
and
that
case
was
approved
by
this
court,
which
included
that
that
one
must
ask
questions
as
to
prejudice
against.
mr.
michael
g.
west
although
as
i
recall
in
your
decision
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
said
that
you
relied
on
ham,
and
all
those
state
cases
upon
which
ham
relied.
and,
i
took
that
as
you
approved
the
ore
reaffirm
aldrich
and
you
also
reaffirmed
those
state
cases
upon
which
aldrich
relied.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
i
think
that
what
you
were
saying
was
that
the
beer
controversy
did
not
rise
to
a
serious
level.
that
did
not
rise
to
a
constitutional
right.
although,
certainly
the
one
has
to
raise
it
but
very
careful
to
limit
it
to
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
g.
west
well,
it
was
just
from
your
language
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
i
assumed
that
you
were
affirming
those
state
cases.
in
fact,
i
am
trying
to
find
that
--
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes,
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
g.
west
yes,
except
the
language
that
i
have
quoted
in
some
papers
in
front
of
me.
it
says
that
the
aldrich
conviction
relied
on
--
the
ham
conviction
was
relying
on
the
firmly
established
precedented
aldrich,
and
the
numerous
state
cases
upon
which
it
rely.
and,
i
took
that
to
mean
that—
mr.
michael
g.
west
it
was
from
the
ham
case
itself.
if
i
can
have
a
moment
later
on,
if
you
would
like,
i
could
find
the
exact
language,
your
honor.
if
i
can
continue?
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
impact
on
the
criminal
justice
system
to
massachusetts
or
the
good
faith
reliance
on
prior
precedent
because
the
issue
in
ham
goes
precisely
to
the
truth
finding
function
of
the
jury
and
errand
the
suspect,
ross’s
conviction
and
therefore
according
to
the
william’s
case,
would
invoke
the
retrospective
application
of
ham,
without
regard
to
good
faith
reliance
and
effect
on
the
criminal
justice
system.
we
are
here
dealing
not
with
an
exclusion
of
evidence
case
or
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
case,
which
this
court
has
generally
not
held
to
be
retroactive.
but,
we
are
dealing
with
the
case
which
shows
the
possibility,
the
probability,
the
likelihood
that
the
ross
jury
acted
in
arbitrary
way,
not
based
upon
the
evidence
and
but
rather
based
upon
the
race
of
mr.
ross,
and
the
conviction
resulted
there
from.
the
purpose
of
applying
ham
retroactively
would
be
to
guarantee
an
accused
a
totally
fair
and
impartial
tribunal,
and,
to
protect
the
integrity
and
dignity
of
the
judicial
process,
from
any
hint
of
bias
or
prejudice.
ross
was
not
afforded
either
of
these
protections.
the
duty
that
the
court’s
of
the
commonwealth
to
massachusetts
owes
the
james
ross
jr.
requires
no
less.
if
i
can
move
on
to
the
issue
of
the
applicability
of
ham
to
ross,
ham
as
you
know,
was
a
case
involving
the
possession
of
marijuana.
the
trial
judge
was
asked
two
question
to
ask
the
perspective
jurors
two
questions,
he
refused
to
do
so.
and,
ask
only
those
general
questions
provided
in
the
south
carolina
statute.
this
court
said
that
the
missing
element
in
the
ham
decision
was
that
the
court
did
not
focus
the
attention
of
the
perspective
jurors
as
to
any
racial
prejudice
they
might
entertain.
and,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
is
also
the
missing
element
in
the
ross
case.
the
ham
case
and
the
ross
case
are
most
similar.
each
involved
the
black
defendant.
in
each
the
principal
witness
was
a
police
officer
or
quasi
police
official.
in
the
ross
case,
he
was
a
security
officer,
dressed
in
the
boston
patrolman’s
uniform,
patrolling
boston
university.
in
order
to
be
found
guilty,
both
ham
and
ross
needed
the
unanimous
verdict.
each
final
jury
was
composed
of
10
whites
and
2
blacks.
the
statutes
upon
which
each
state
operates
is
almost
identical,
asking
the
same
questions.
the
procedure
in
each
state
is
the
same.
so,
even
wide
discretion
to
the
trial
judge.
and
in
each
case,
two
jurors
were
excused
because
of
racial
prejudice,
in
the
ham
case
and
the
ross
case.
and
finally,
each
question
that
was
presented
to
this
court
for
decision
in
the
cert
petitions
filed
by
ross
and
ham
were
almost
identical.
aldrich
was
a
case
whose
facts
are
strikingly
similar
to
ross.
the
ham
case
relied
i
think
heavily
on
aldrich
and
affirmed
aldrich,
and
i
think
the
significance
of
the
ham
case
was
that
it
reaffirmed
aldrich
and
gave
it
explicit
constitutional
underpinnings.
ross
asserts
that
the
trial
judge
failure
to
ask
specific
questions
as
to
racial
prejudice
is
not
only
constitutional
error,
but
requires
reversal
without
the
need
to
show
actual
prejudice.
it
is
twistic
logic
as
the
commonwealth
asserts
that
on
the
one
hand,
ross
was
not
entitled
to
have
these
questions
asked.
but
on
the
other
hand,
he
must
show
actual
prejudice.
one
wonders
how
a
criminal
defendant
can
show
actual
prejudice
without
being
able
to
ask
questions
of
perspective
jurors.
mr.
michael
g.
west
i
meant
the
reversal
of
this
conviction
and
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
can
the
commonwealth
assure
james
ross,
that
any
error
here
was
harmless
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt?
can
the
commonwealth
assure
this
court
that
not
one
of
the
jurors
chosen,
harbored
any
prejudice
against
ross
because
of
his
race?
we
can
not,
especially
because
of
the
conclusions,
reached
by
the
kerner
commission
and
the
recent
events
concerning
racial
segregation
and
integration
in
boston,
even
if
one
the
12
jurors
were
prejudiced
against
ross,
his
right
to
a
fair
trial
was
impaired.
seemingly
in
recognition
of
the
difficulty
of
criminal
defendants
to
show
actual
prejudice,
this
court
on
several
occasions
has
dispensed
with
this
requirement.
in
aldrich,
and
in
ham,
in
peter
versus
kiff,
the
court
said
more
over,
if
there
is
no
showing
of
actual
bias
in
the
tribunal,
this
court
has
held,
due
process
is
denied
by
circumstances
that
create
the
likelihood
or
the
appearance
of
bias.
same
result
in
taylor
versus
louisiana,
the
defendant
there
did
not
allege
that
the
failure
to
have
woman
on
the
jury
was
actually
prejudicial.
in
conclusion
and
summary,
although
massachusetts
abolished
slavery
in
1783,
racism
is
still
part
of
american
life.
so
much
so
that
the
kerner
commission
report
stated
1968
that
race
prejudice
has
shaped
our
history
decisively
in
the
past,
and
now
threatens
to
do
so
again.
one
cannot
doubt
the
validity
of
that
part
of
the
kerner
commission
report.
certainly,
this
court
in
both
aldrich
and
ham
have
recognized
that
problem
and
ross
asked
that
you
do
so
again.
failure
to
afford
james
ross,
a
new
trial
after
struggling
for
over
5
years,
and
7
appellate
hearings
is
as
stated
so
eloquently
by
mr.
justice
marshall
to
see
this
court’s
decision
in
ham
versus
south
carolina
still
born,
and
to
write
an
epitaph
for
those
essential
demands
of
fairness,
recognized
by
this
court
over
40
years
ago
in
aldrich.
thank
you.
