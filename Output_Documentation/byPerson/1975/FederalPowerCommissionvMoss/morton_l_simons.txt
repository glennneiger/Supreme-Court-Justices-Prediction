mr.
morton
l.
simons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
the
government
has
rather
studiously
avoided
saying
just
what
it
is,
that
is
supposed
to
be
looked
at
in
an
abandonment
case.
he
says
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
defines
it
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
when
it
must
be
done,
but
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
interpret
this
section
of
the
act,
section
7
(b),
the
prohibition
against
abandonment
of
service
without
commission
approval,
without
an
understanding
of
what
is
intended
by
that
section
and
this
courts
sunray
decision
in
364
us,
does
go
to
what
the
policies
of
that
section
were.
what
essentially
they
are
intended
to
do
is
to
do
at
the
time
of
abandonment,
contemporaneous
with
abandonment,
not
an
advanced
license,
but
contemporaneous
with
abandonment
to
make
a
determination
of
one
of
two
things.
whether
the
supply
is
depleted
or
whether
abandonment
maybe
permitted
by
public
convenience
and
necessity,
which
historically
has
meant
is
there
is
still
a
continuing
public
need
for
this
service.
if
there
is
a
continuing
public
need
for
the
service
at
the
time
the
abandonment
is
proposed,
then
abandonment
is
not
granted.
counsel
for
the
government
is
simply
wrong,
when
he
says
the
commission
has
flip-flopped
all
over
the
place
on
this.
there
is
not
a
single
case
that
the
government
cites,
where
they
have
ever
allowed
pregranted
abandonment.
and,
with
reference
to
limited
term
certificates
and
pregranted
abandonment,
i
do
not
think
it
is
useful
to
wander
down
that
semantic
pathway,
but
there
is
conceptually
a
distinction
between
the
two.
a
limited
term
certificate
is
appropriate
where
the
seller
only
has
a
limited
commodity
to
sell.
as
for
example,
where
he
is
committed
his
gas
to
someone
else,
he
sold
it
in
interstate
commerce,
the
interstate
sale
is
not
to
commence
for
two
years,
he
therefore,
can
make
a
sale
for
the
two
years,
until
the
other
sales
starts.
a
limited
term
certificate
would
be
appropriate.
indeed,
it
might
even
be
mandatory,
since
he
would
have
not
more
than
a
two
years
supply
to
show,
but
when
you
come
to
abandonment,
one
service
has
been
started,
the
question
is
does
the
public
still
need
the
service
at
that
point
in
time.
what
was
new
about
what
the
commission
did
here?
it
decided
that
regulation
in
its
normal
traditional
sense
was
chasing
gas
away
from
the
interstate
market.
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thinking
that
was
involved
in
the
small
producer
exemption
case
that
came
to
this
court
in
texaco
v.
fpc,
a
year
ago
this
past
june.
indeed
the
two
cases,
the
small
producer
case
and
the
optional
procedure
case,
the
optional
regulation
case
march
through
the
courts
one
behind
the
other.
in
the
small
producer
case,
the
commission’s
rule
was
adopted
in
1971.
the
commission’s
rule
here
was
adopted
in
august
’72.
the
small
producer
rule
was
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
december
1972
and
we
briefed
the
case
in
the
court
below
against
that
background.
then
this
court
granted
certiorari.
we
argued
the
case
below.
this
court
in
june
of
1974,
unanimously
held
that
the
small
producer
exemption
had
to
be
set
aside.
the
mere
fact
that
the
commission
found
that
regulation
was
having
a
discouraging
effect
than
that
if
you
had
partial
deregulation,
you
might
encourage
new
supply.
it
was
a
consideration
for
congress.
it
was
not
one
that
could
be
made
by
the
commission.
the
commission
then
submitted
to
the
court
below,
this
court’s
decision
in
texaco
and
its
contemporary
decision
in
mobil
and
that
court
in
a
very
careful
decision,
drew
some
very
important
distinctions
in
finding
that
two
of
the
three
major
parts
of
the
rule,
the
optional
regulation
rule,
valid
and
the
third
one,
the
so-called
pregranted
abandonment
invalid.
i
want
to
discuss
just
very
briefly
what
the
three
are
to
explain
why
i
think
it
is
that
the
court
made
the
distinction.
there
were
three
parts
to
optional
regulation.
the
commission
had
said
just
in
reasonable
levels.
these
were
at
maximum
levels
that
could
be
charged.
at
the
time
of
the
1972
rule,
the
dominant
price
was
the
26
cent
level
that
this
court
ultimately
sustained
in
the
mobil
case
in
june
of
’74.
the
commission
said,
“we
want
to
permit
sales
at
above
the
just
and
reasonable
level.”
those
of
us
who
are
opposing
it,
argued,
that
the
commission
lack
power
to
do
that
because
it
was
deviating
from
its
own
just
and
reasonable
standard.
the
second
thing
the
commission
wanted
to
do;
it
wanted
to
permit
escalations
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
if
it
was
over
twenty-year
period
and
there
was
a
provision
for
it,
2
cent
increase
each
year.
it
wanted
to
grant
approval
to
that.
it
wanted
to
grant
approval
at
the
outset
to
that.
and,
the
third
thing
it
wanted
to
do;
it
wanted
to
grant
pregranted
abandonment.
if
it
had
a
ten-year
contract
it
wanted
to
grant
the
7
(b)
abandonment
at
the
very
time
that
it
authorized
the
sale
to
commence,
prior
even
the
commencement
of
the
sale.
it
wanted
to
do
everything
it
wants.
when
the
rule
was
still
before
the
commission,
the
commission
retrenched
somewhat
and
it
conceded
that
it
could
not
insulate
the
rate
and
the
service
from
review
by
subsequent
commissions
during
the
term
of
the
sale.
it
would
still
remain
subject
to
section
5
review
as
to
its
justness
and
reasonable
on
initiation
of
an
investigation
by
any
subsequent
commission
during
the
term.
with
respect
to
the
rate
increases,
the
court
below
made
clear
that
while
the
commission
could
say
that
it
was
approving
them
at
the
outset,
the
producer
who
received
the
certificate
would
have
to
file
for
the
increases
and
if
the
commission
in
effect
in
office,
at
the
time
those
firing
were
made
so
determined,
it
could
suspend
those
increases
and
follow
the
normal
procedure
under
section
4
(c)
and
4
(d)
of
the
act,
putting
the
burden
back
on
the
applicant
of
justifying
the
increase.
with
those
interpretations
and
with
this
determination
also
that
the
initial
price
had
to
at
least,
take
into
account
cost
data.
the
court
was
able
to
sustain
the
first
two
parts;
a
price
in
excess
of
the
just
and
reasonable
ceiling
and
the
escalations
during
the
term.
when
it
came
to
the
third
part
and
i
think
this
is
really
what
is
crucial,
if
pregranted
abandonment
were
permitted,
if
the
commission
in
1973
said,
“we
are
going
to
authorize
abandonment
in
1980,”
when
the
commission
in
1980
came
to
look
at
this,
it
would
have
nothing
to
do.
its
hands
would
be
tied.
it
would
be
totally
unprecedented.
now,
section
7
(b)
is
just
your
standard
ordinary
everyday
abandonment
type
provision.
it
came
out
of
parallel
provisions
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
is
similar
to
provisions
and
other
regulatory
statutes
and
what
is
involved?
what
indeed
the
sunray
decision?
in
sunray
i,
the
first
of
the
two
decisions
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit,
its
1956
decision,
which
the
government
relied
so
heavily
on,
that
court
stated,
“no
single
factor
in
the
commission's
duty
to
protect
the
public
can
be
more
important
to
the
public
than
the
continuity
of
the
service
furnished
and
the
court
went
on
to
note
that
without
that
power,
all
of
the
other
commission's
powers
fell
apart
if
the
producer
can
abandon.
now,
i
think
that
the
difficulty
and
the
real
dispute
between
ourselves
and
the
government
is
a
question
of
what
is
abandonment
supposed
to
do
and
how
does
this
limited
term
concept
fit
in
it?it
is
our
position
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
pregranted
abandonment.
that
a
pregranted
abandonment
is
different
from
a
limited
term
certificate.
that
a
limited
term
certificate
is
available
only
in
very
rare,
very
special
circumstances.
the
government
itself
cites
only
one
case
in
footnote
10
of
its
brief
and
that
again
is
the
case
where
a
seller
has
sold
its
gas
already,
the
buyer
is
not
ready
to
take
it,
it
wants
to
make
a
sell,
pending
its
original
sale
until
such
--
mr.
morton
l.
simons
at
the
end
of
8th
year?
mr.
morton
l.
simons
obviously,
you
have
to
come
in
before
the
time
is
due
and
i
think
that
there
is
some
period
of
time;
a
year,
18
months,
maybe
two
years.
the
difficulty
i
have
and
it
goes
in
part
to
what
the
commission
says.
of
course,
commission
projections
as
to
the
future
are
to
be
respected.
well,
that
is
what
all
you
can
do.
i
think
that
the
commission
is
entitled
to
estimate
for
a
year
ahead
or
year-and-a-half
ahead,
as
long
as
it
takes
to
run
the
proceeding.
i
think
by
the
time
you
get
to
three
years
or
five
years,
it
is
unreasonable
because
there
is
no
need
to
run
your
proceeding
that
much
in
advance
of
the
date
that
the
abandonment
is
proposed.
it
is
simply
a
question
of
what
is
sensible
under
the
circumstances.
now,
i
think
the
key
is
the
contemporaneous
determination.
contemporaneous
does
not
mean
the
same
day.
there
can
be
a
lap
over
of
let
us
say
a
year.
some
reasonable
time,
but
contemporaneous
determination
was
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
sunray
and
what
it
was
concerned
about,
it
did
not
want
an
advance
license
to
permit
abandonment.
obviously,
the
permission
to
abandonment
has
to
be
granted
at
some
point
before
the
actual
abandonment,
but
not
an
advance
license.
now,
counsel
for
the
government
has
stated
that
the
alternative
is
to
loose
the
gas
all
together
without
pregranted
abandonment.
that
unless
pregranted
abandonment
is
permitted,
the
gas
will
never
be
dedicated
to
the
interstate
market.
but
what
this
is
essentially
saying
is
that
the
producer
does
not
want
to
be
regulated
in
whole,
if
part
of
what
regulation
is
all
about
is
taken
off,
he
may
be
wiling
to
play.
it
is
a
difficult
problem.
certainly,
it
is
a
difficult
policy
problem,
but
it
is
a
policy
problem
that
was
resolved
by
congress.
and,
it
was
a
policy
problem
that
was
answered
by
this
court,
interpreting
the
congressional
intent
in
the
catco
case
back,
atlantic
refining
versus
public
service
commission
360
us.
there
the
producers
said,
“we
would
not
sell,
unless
we
get
our
price”
and
the
courts
--
the
commission
originally
said,
“your
price
is
too
high.”
the
applicant
said,
“we
will
not
sell
at
all,
unless
we
get
our
price.”
there
will
be
a
deprivation
of
gas
to
the
interstate
market,
so
the
commission
said,
“alright,
you
could
have
your
price.”
this
court
said,
“no,
that
is
not
lawful.
that
permits
an
unlawful
price
to
be
exacted.”
the
producer
cannot
condition
his
entry
into
the
market
upon
his
getting
the
higher
price
and
use
that
as
a
justification
for
the
commission
giving
him
an
unjust
price.
it
said
the
only
thing
that
the
commission
can
do
in
those
circumstances
is
to
authorize
service,
but
conditioned
at
the
reasonable
level.
mr.
morton
l.
simons
correct,
no
question
about
that
and
we
go
back
of
course
to
the
dilemma
that
mr.
justice
white
recognized
for
unanimous
court
in
texaco,
a
little
over
a
year
ago.
it
may
well
be,
there
are
certainly
arguments
made
that
regulation
is
counterproductive
in
a
time
of
shortage.
it
maybe
that
it
is
not.
it
maybe
that
is
when
you
need
it
most,
but
even
if
we
assume
that
it
is
counterproductive,
even
if
we
assume
that
it
chases
gas
away
from
the
interstate
market,
the
determination
is
one
to
be
made
in
congress.
counsel
refers
to
a
bill
that
apparently
was
approved
yesterday
by
house
commerce
committee,
addressing
itself
to
some
of
these
emergency
problems.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
bill,
but
i
do
say
that
is
the
forum
where
it
ought
to
be
handled.
it
ought
not
to
be
handled
by
the
commission
saying,
the
producers
do
not
like
regulation,
so
we
will
peal
off
a
few
of
the
more
egregious
layers
of
regulations,
the
parts
they
like
the
least
and
see
if
this
will
coax
them
to
play.
that
is
the
determination
that
congress
ought
to
make.
now,
the
decision
below,
judge
rob's
(ph)
decision
was
very
carefully
drafted.
he
analyzed
what
was
involved,
what
was
not
involved.
we
were
unhappy
with
the
parts
of
his
decision
that
sustained
the
commission.
we
think
it
would
have
been
better
really
to
throw
out
the
whole
of
the
optional
procedure.
but
certainly
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
the
matters
before
him
were
not
carefully
considered
in
light
of
this
court’s
decision,
including
its
two
most
recent,
in
texaco
and
mobil.
now,
there
is
one
other
thing
and
that
is
the
whole
thrust,
both
of
the
small
producer
case
that
this
court
set
aside
a
year
ago
of
this
optional
regulation
that
is
before
the
court
in
part
now,
has
been
the
commission’s
theory
that
if
it
does
these
various
things,
if
it
makes
regulation
easier,
there
will
be
more
gas
forthcoming.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
and
we
have
had
now
three
years
of
history,
under
optional
regulation,
there
has
not
been
more
gas
forthcoming.
in
the
first
two
quarters
of
this
year,
which
is
the
most
recent
period
for
which
the
commission
has
made
data
available,
there
have
been
no
proceedings
under
the
optional
procedure.
it
is
a
procedure
that
as
not
worked
and
it
is
not
working.
there
are
reasons
for
it,
but
certainly
whether
there
is
pregranted
abandonment
in
it
or
not,
no
important
commission
program,
no
important
public
interest
is
being
affected
because
in
fact,
there
are
no
sales
being
made
pursuant
to
this
program.
the
commission
itself
has
indicated
in
a
series
of
recent
orders
that
it
has
grave
doubts
about
the
validity
of
pregranted
abandonment
of
even
what
it
calls
limited
certificates
and
it
makes
a
distinction
between
limited
terms
certificates
and
pregranted
abandonment
and
it
has
increasingly
declined
to
issue
certificates
for
limited
term
certificates
or
to
give
pregranted
abandonment.
the
short
answer
your
honors,
i
think
is
simply
this.
the
abandonment
provision
is
an
important
protection
to
the
public.
once
service
is
commenced,
the
public
becomes
dependent
on
that
service.
it
is
an
incident
of
regulation.
it
is
an
incident
of
regulations
that
obviously
the
regulated
company
likes
less
well
than
if
it
were
not
there.
yet,
it
is
required
to
protect
the
public.
the
proper
determination
should
be
made
by
the
commission
in
office
at
the
time
the
abandonment
is
proposed
or
immediately
before
the
time
the
abandonment
is
proposed.
the
statute
should
not
be
changed
by
administrative
interpretation
of
federal
power
commission.
and,
the
federal
power
commission,
except
for
footnote
10,
the
one
limited
case
we
spoke
about
has
cited
no
other
case,
when
it
would
be
appropriate
to
grant
pregranted
abandonment.
if
it
wants
the
footnote
10-type
exception,
where
gas
has
already
been
sold
to
a,
to
start
two
years
hands
on,
it
has
some
gas
to
sell
to
b
during
that
intervening
period.
it
can
draft
a
rule
far
tighter,
far
more
carefully
than
the
broad
gauge
rule
it
rafted
here
and
that
the
court
below,
very
properly
set
aside.
thank
you
very
much.
