mr.
simons,
when
you
say
a
pregranted
abandonment
simply
is
not
available,
would
you
include
in
that
say
a
determination
by
the
commission
at
the
end
of
the
8th
year
or
a
10th
year
limited
certificate
or
say
unlimited,
so
that
abandonment
will
be
permitted
at
the
end
of
10
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
producer
can
and
choose
to
stay
out
of
the
interstate
market?
