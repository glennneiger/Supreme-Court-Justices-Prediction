the
producer
gets
the
limited
certificate
and
can
abandon
at
the
end
of
the
term,
but
does
it
abandon
without
complying
with
some
procedure,
as
you
suggested
earlier,
there
is
still
a
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

in
other
words,
if
you
got
a
ten-year
certificate
and
it
is
permitted
to
abandon
at
the
end
of
ten
years
and
come
at
the
end
of
ten
years
and
that
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
he
goes
out
for
the
sales
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
both
opinions
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
inherent
argument
in
sunray,
however,
was
that
the
commission
decided
not
to
do
that
and
insisted
that
producers
take
an
unlimited
certificate,
either
they
took
the
unlimited
the
certificate
or
they
do
not
get
the
certificate?
justice

this
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
involves
a
recently
promulgated
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
establishing
an
optional
procedure
for
certificating
new
producer
sales
of
natural
gas,
adopted
by
the
commission
to
stimulate
domestic
exploration
and
development
of
new
natural
gas
reserves.
among
another
provisions,
this
order
authorizes
the
federal
power
commission
when
certificating
new
gas
production
to
authorize
the
producer
to
abandon
the
sale
at
the
end
of
the
contract
term.
in
other
words,
it’s
a
pregranted
abandonment
authorization
under
which
the
producer,
when
the
contract
expires,
is
free
to
discontinue
deliveries
to
the
original
purchaser
without
having
to
demonstrate
at
the
end
of
the
contract
term
of
that
abandonment
comports
with
the
public
convenience
or
necessity.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
provision
was
without
the
authority
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
provide.
we
disagree.
for
reasons
expressed
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court,
we
hold
that
the
federal
power
commission
properly
can’t
determined
at
the
time
of
certification,
and
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
or
necessity
justifies
the
issuance
of
the
certificate
allowing
discontinuance
of
service
at
a
future
date
without
need
for
further
proceedings.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
powell,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
