mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
one
portion
of
a
federal
power
commission
order
entered
in
1972,
which
established
an
optional
procedure
for
the
certification
of
new
sales
of
natural
gas
by
producers
to
interstate
pipelines.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
upheld
the
order
in
every
respect,
except
one.
it
ruled
that
the
commission
has
no
authority
under
the
natural
gas
act
to
authorize
the
future
termination
of
a
sale
of
natural
gas
at
the
same
time
that
it
authorizes
the
sale
to
commence.
this
court
granted
the
commission’s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
validity
of
this
advanced
termination
issue,
which
the
commission
refer
to
in
its
order
as
pregranted
abandonment
authority.
the
court
simultaneously
denied
a
cross
petition
by
the
respondents
here
seeking
to
raise
the
remaining
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment.
although
this
single
feature
of
the
order
is
before
the
court,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
outline
very
briefly
the
problems
at
the
optional
procedure
program
was
designed
to
meet
and
the
solutions
that
the
commission
devised.
like
several
other
recent
orders
that
have
been
before
the
court,
by
the
power
commission,
this
is
one
of
a
number
of
efforts
that
the
commission
has
undertaken
in
order
to
fulfill
its
responsibility
to
assure
an
adequate
supply
of
gas
to
an
interstate
market
that
has
been
increasingly
in
critical
shortage
of
supply.
the
commission
focused
here
on
a
particular
set
of
problems,
resulting
principally
from
the
lengthy
rate
review
proceedings
that
had
been
endemic
ever
since
almost
the
commission
began
regulating
producer
sales.
these
lengthy
procedures
resulted
in
rate
uncertainties
that
the
commission
determined
were
impeding
the
willingness
of
producers
to
undertake
new
exploration
and
development
of
gas
reserves.
even
under
the
area
rate
proceedings,
the
commission’s
rate
review
function
had
seemed
interminable
and
even
after
they
were
concluded,
there
were
lengthy
and
very
complex
traditional
review
proceedings,
two
of
which
this
court
--
reached
this
court.
the
rates
collected
by
the
producers
during
this
entire
period
were
under
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
collected
subject
to
the
possibility
of
refund
if
the
rates
were
ultimately
determined
to
be
in
excess
of
the
level
found
to
be
just
and
reasonable
and
producers
as
a
consequence
were
unsure
that
the
funds
they
had
already
collected
were
really
there.
so,
whether
they
would
have
to
be
refunded
nor
could
they
accurately
predict
how
much
they
could
expect
to
receive
as
a
return
on
investments,
because
there
was
no
assurance
what
the
rate
was
likely
to
be
in
the
future.
all
that
they
knew
for
sure
is
the
commission
stated
in
its
order
here
was
that
once
that
they
started
deliveries
to
the
interstate
market,
they
could
not
stop,
unless
they
were
able
to
persuade
the
commission
that
the
public
interest
permitted
the
abandonment
of
this
service.
with
the
availability
of
the
existing
capital
and
with
the
prospective
rate
of
return
on
their
investment
unsure
and
with
the
prospect
of
an
indefinite
commitment
to
an
interstate
market
which
were
unsettled
prices,
the
commission
found
that
producers
naturally
attended
to
act
cautiously
before
embarking
upon
new
exploration
and
development
and
before
committing
new
acreage
to
the
interstate
market.
the
order
here
was
designed
to
meet
these
problems
by
making
available
to
producers
an
alternative
to
the
area
rate
procedure
and
in
the
effect
giving
them
the
ability
to
establish
rates
with
certainty
over
the
life
of
their
contracts.
first,
the
procedure
permitted
the
producers
to
file
for
the
commission’s
approval,
contracts
for
the
sale
of
new
gas
to
interstate
pipelines
at
initial
rates
and
at
fixed
incremental
rates
provided
for
in
the
contract
above
the
applicable
area
ceiling
level.
second,
the
commission
indicated
that
it
would
then
conduct
in
a
single
proceeding
and
promptly
consider
and
resolve,
whether
the
sale
was
one
that
should
be
certificated
as
consistent
with
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
section
7
and
would
also
consider
and
determine
whether
it
could
approve
as
just
and
reasonable,
both
the
initial
rate
in
the
contract,
as
well
every
fixed
increment
in
the
contract.
third,
if
the
commission
issued
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
and
approved
the
rates
specified
in
the
contract,
including
these
increments,
the
producer
was
to
be
free
to
collect
them
without
risk
of
refund.
the
commission
undertook
to
the
extent
that
it
could
to
assure
the
certainty
of
the
rates
that
it
had
approved
for
the
life
of
the
contract.
fourth,
and
really
the
only
directly
pertinent
aspect
of
the
order,
as
far
as
this
case
goes,
is
that
the
commission
indicated
that
it
would
be
willing
to
consider
in
the
same
single
proceeding
at
which
it
would
consider
certification
and
approval
of
the
rates.
it
would
be
willing
to
consider
request
by
the
producer
for
authority
in
advance,
to
terminate
service
to
the
pipeline
at
the
end
of
the
contract
term.
this
is
the
feature
that
the
court
--
that
the
commission
titled
pregranted
abandonment.
the
theory
was
that
some
otherwise
unavailable
gas
might
be
attracted
to
the
interstate
market
if
the
producers
were
given
advance
assurance
that
at
the
end
of
the
contract
term,
he
would
be
free
to
discontinue
deliveries
without
having
to
demonstrate,
again,
at
the
end
of
the
term
that
discontinuance
was
consistent
with
the
public
interest
at
that
time.
these
benefits
of
the
optional
procedure
were
not
without
a
quid
pro
quo
because
the
producers
was
required
to
live
with
the
rates
set
in
the
contract.
he
had
to
waive
his
right,
which
he
ordinarily
would
have
under
section
4
of
the
act
to
file
notice
of
rate
changes
for
the
life
of
the
contract.
he
also
had
to
waive
his
right
to
receive,
under
certain
applicable
area
rate
orders,
to
receive
contingent
escalations
of
price
for
existing
sales
of
flowing
gas
or
other
purchasers.
and
finally,
the
contract
could
contain
no
indefinite
pricing
clause,
that
is
one
that
referred
to
a
variable
standard,
such
as
what
is
common
in
many
contracts,
an
area
rate
clause,
which
says
that
the
rate
provided
for
in
this
contract
will
reflect
the
maximum
allowed
by
the
commission
under
the
applicable
area
rate.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
make
clear
what
pregranted
abandonment
feature
of
the
order
is
not.
respondents’
contentions
here
are
bottomed
on
the
assumption,
which
is
made
repeatedly
in
their
brief
that
this
aspect
of
the
order
amounts
to
a
form
of
deregulation.
that
is
simply
not
so.
the
commission
has
not
relinquished
its
control
over
the
termination
of
service,
nor
has
it
in
any
way
indicated
that
it
is
prepared
to
abandon
these
explicit
statutory
standards,
governing
the
termination
of
service.
on
the
contrary,
the
commission’s
order
indicates
unambiguously
that
future
termination
will
not
be
authorized,
unless
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
proposed
termination
will
be
consistent
with
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity,
which
is
the
standard
under
section
7
(b)
of
the
act.
this
is
not
deregulation.
a
good
example
of
what
is
deregulation
is
contained
in
a
bill
pending
before
congress,
which
i
even
told
was
approved
by
the
full
house
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
hr9464
approved,
i
am
told
only
yesterday
by
the
committee,
which
is
a
design
to
assure
the
availability
of
adequate
supplies
of
natural
gas
during
this
winter
and
the
following
winter
and
it
would
permit
certain
sales
of
natural
gas
to
be
made
without
commission
rate
regulation
in
a
limited
class
of
cases.
and,
section
6
of
this
bill
provides
that
the
abandonment
provisions
of
section
7
shall
not
apply
to
those
sales.
the
effect
of
that
bill
if
it
is
enacted
will
be
to
allow
the
producer
consistent
with
his
contract
obligations
to
terminate
the
sale
of
natural
gas
at
his
will
and
whenever
he
wishes
without
need
for
any
commission
approval,
that
is
deregulation.
the
order
here
would
have
no
such
effect,
because
the
commission
would
retain
full
authority
and
full
control
over
both
whether
and
when
termination
would
take
place.
there
is
another
point
i
would
like
emphasize,
which
is
that
the
order
in
this
case
is
not
an
order,
granting
an
authority
to
terminate
service
at
any
point.
the
order
here
is
simply
the
establishment
of
a
procedure,
by
which
the
commission
has
indicated
its
willingness
to
consider
applications
for
such
authority.
the
issue
is
consequently
quite
abstract.
it
is
not
whether
the
commission
will
regulate,
but
rather
when
and
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
establishment
of
a
procedure,
rather
than
with
the
grant
of
any
authority,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
respondents
have
very
heavy
burden
of
demonstrating
that
in
no
conceivable
circumstances
could
the
commission
ever
authorize
termination
of
service
at
the
same
time
that
it
authorizes
a
certification.
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
held
precisely
that.
that
is
that
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
this
could
be
ever
be
done.
in
its
view,
section
7
(b)
requires
that
any
authorization
to
terminate
service
be
granted
at
the
time
roughly,
when
the
termination
is
proposed.
there
is
an
irony
to
that
holding.
until
twenty
years
ago
that
was
in
fact
the
commission’s
position,
with
respect
to
section
7
(b).
the
issue
was
first
litigated
in
court,
in
mid
1950s
in
a
series
of
sunray
of
cases,
one
of
which
ultimately
reached
this
court,
as
i
will
mention
in
a
moment,
a
producer
in
the
sunray
litigation
has
sought
a
certificate
for
sales
of
natural
gas
to
a
pipeline
and
had
asked
the
commission
to
limit
the
certificate
to
the
duration
of
the
underlying
contract
term.
the
commission
issued
a
certificate,
but
the
client
issued
it
with
the
limitation
requested,
on
the
ground
that
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
here,
that
it
cannot
do
so
except
in
a
separate
proceeding,
commenced
under
section
7
(b)
and
at
the
time
of
the
termination.
well,
that
went
to
the
tenth
circuit,
which
ruled
that
the
commission
was
in
error.
it
held
that
so
long
as
the
commission
exercised
its
statutory
control
over
the
termination,
it
could
do
so
at
the
time
of
certification,
as
well
as
at
the
time
of
the
termination.
it
also
ruled,
however,
that
because
the
producers
had
not
demonstrated
a
reason
why
he
should
be
allowed
to
terminate,
the
commission’s
order
should
be
affirmed
anyway
and
what
followed
was
a
petition
for
a
certiorari
by
the
producer,
asking
that
the
case
be
sent
back
to
the
commission
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
this
new
holding
that
it
has
authority
that
it
thought
it
had
not.
commission
filed
a
response
in
this
court
saying
that
on
further
study
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
agreed
with
the
legal
holding
of
the
court
and
it
did
not
object
to
the
proposed
disposition
of
the
case,
which
the
court
in
a
per
curiam
opinion,
in
fact
did.
a
few
years
later,
there
was
a
second
round
of
sunray
litigation,
which
did
reach
this
court,
on
the
merits.
again
the
same
producer,
but
different
set
of
sales.
he
sought
again
a
limited
term
certificate
and
again
the
commission
tendered
an
unlimited
certificate,
this
time
acknowledging
its
authority
to
grant
a
limited
term
certificate,
but
finding
that
there
had
not
been
showing
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
be
served
by
doing
so.
on
review,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed,
holding
that
while
the
commission
has
authority
and
acknowledges
that
it
has
authority
to
grant
a
certificate,
which
would
expire
of
its
own
force,
it
is
not
required
t
do
so
in
the
absence
of
adequate
showings.
and
this
court,
subsequently
grant
a
certiorari
and
affirmed
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
reported
at
364
us.
and,
while
the
only
question
presented
in
the
case
was
whether
the
commission
could
properly
issue
an
unlimited
certificate,
when
one
of
limited
duration
was
applied
for,
the
court’s
opinion,
as
well
as
the
dissenting
opinions
plainly
presupposed
that
the
commission
had
authority
under
the
statute
to
grant
limited
terms
certificates.
the
question
was
whether
it
also
had
the
authority
not
to.
and
this
court’s
opinion
quite
pointedly
stated
at
page
157,
that
there
was
no
contention
that
the
commission
was,
and
i
am
quoting,
“again
indulging
in
the
erroneous
notion
that
it
had
no
power
to
issue
a
limited
term
certificate.”
the
court
cited
at
that
point
the
tenth
circuit’s
opinion
in
the
first
round
of
the
sunray
litigation,
which
in
fact
established
that
the
commission
had
the
power.
the
court’s
holding,
as
i
read
it
in
the
second
sunray
opinion
here,
was
that
the
commission
could
properly
decline
the
issue
of
limited
term
certificate,
if
it
did
so
with
the
recognition
that
it
had
authority
to
grant
one.
respondents
have
made
no
effort
in
their
brief
to
distinguish
between
the
limited
term
certificates
that
were
involved
in
the
sunray
litigation
and
the
so-called
pregranted
abandonment
authority
that
is
involved
here
and
there
is
not
any
distinction
between
them
anyway.
in
either
case,
the
commission
simultaneously
authorizes
the
commencement
of
a
sale
and
the
future
termination
of
the
sale
at
the
date
certain
without
need
for
additional
and
subsequent
commission
approval
at
the
end
of
the
term.
nor
do
respondents
even
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
this
court’s
statement
in
this
sunray
opinion,
concerning
the
power
to
issue
the
limited
terms
certificate,
much
less
did
they
attempt
to
explain
why
there
is
not
a
full
answer
to
their
contentions
here.
they
prefer
to
ignore
that
aspect
of
the
sunray
opinion
and
to
focus
on
language
elsewhere
in
the
opinion
from
which
they
seem
to
draw
some
comfort,
unduly
i
think
and
that
was
also
the
court
of
appeals
error.
the
language
relied
upon
by
both
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
respondents
relates
only
to
the
dangers
that
the
court
perceived
from
a
holding
that
the
commission
work
was
compelled
to
grant
a
limited
certificate
merely
because
it
was
requested
by
the
applicant.
the
order
here
does
not
have
any
of
those
dangers
and
that
language,
it
seems
to
me,
totally
inapplicable.
the
commission
has
made
clear
that
it
would
not
automatically
grant
abandonment
authority
on
a
producer's
request,
but
require
a
showing
that
the
public
interest
would
thereby
be
served
and
as
we
indicate
in
footnote
9
of
our
brief,
at
pages
17
to
18,
the
commission
has
in
fact
rejected
such
requests
precisely
because
no
such
showing
was
made.
in
light
of
this
history,
it
seems
to
us
the
case
is
very
simple.
the
short
of
it
is
that
section
7
(b)
simply
does
not
address
the
question
of
when
the
commission
may
properly
authorize
the
termination
of
service.
it
is
designed
as
the
legislative
history
reflects
merely
to
ensure
that
the
commission
has
control
over
the
termination.
it
leaves
to
the
commission
to
question
of
when
that
control
is
going
to
be
exercised.
the
respondent's
contention
that
the
commission
cannot
possibly
foresee
at
the
time
of
certification
what
the
public
interest
will
be
at
the
time
of
termination,
really
rests
on
a
faulty
premise
that
the
only
proper
inquiry
for
the
commission
is
whether
the
public
would
need
to
gas
at
a
date
after
the
proposed
termination.
well,
that
is
just
no
right.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
forecloses
the
commission
from
considering
as
one
element
of
the
public
--
of
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
there
is
no
additional
procedure.
that
is
the
same
as
it
was
--
it
is
the
same
as
it
would
have
been
in
sunray
if
the
request
of
certificate
had
been
granted.
mr.

mr.

evans

is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
well,
it
would
be,
but
it
would
be
by
the
commission’s
choice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right
and
indeed
the
commission
can
do
so
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
i
think
that
is
suggested
by
the
opinions
in
sunray.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right,
not
only
the
majority
opinion,
but
also
the
dissenting
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
precisely
and
the
same
as
through
here.
if
an
applicant
applies
for
pregranted
abandonment,
the
so-called
in
this
context
and
the
commission
decides
that
a
showing
has
not
been
made,
as
in
fact
the
case
cited
in
the
footnote
i
mentioned
did,
it
is
up
to
him.
he
can
take
it
without
the
pregranted
abandonment
or
he
can
reject
it.
it
is
his
option.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
is
--
well
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes
--
well,
prior
the
sunray,
the
court’s
opinion
i
think
in
sunray,
points
at
that
there
were
a
couple
of
instances
in
its
early
history
when
it
was
granted
without
discussion.
somewhere
--
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
limited
--
limited
in
duration.
the
cases
are
cited
in
the
footnote
in
the
sunray
opinion
and
i
looked
at
them.
there
was
no
discussion
and
i
do
not
know
what
happened
between
that
early
history
and
the
subsequent
time
when
the
commission
decided
that
it
did
not
have
that
authority,
but
that
issue
was
again
is
flip
flopped
all
through
the
history.
originally,
they
thought
they
had
it
apparently,
then
they
changed
their
minds
and
thought
they
did
not
have
authority
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
wrong,
exactly.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
whether
it
was
a
holding
or
not.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
think
you
could
characterize
it
as
a
holding,
because
i
think,
as
i
said
what
the
court
was
holding
is
that
the
commission
could
refuse
to
grant
a
limited
certificate,
but
only
if
it
did
so
with
the
recognition
that
it
had
authority
to
do
so,
that
it
had
authority
to
grant
a
limited
certificate.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
exactly,
it
rests
on
that
assumption.
i
was
saying
that
the
respondents
here
suggest
that
the
only
inquiry
that
is
proper
at
the
time
of
the
certification
what
the
public's
need
for
the
gas
will
be
at
the
conclusion
of
the
contract.
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
to
support
that.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
commission
cannot
take
into
account
at
the
time
of
certification,
as
one
element
of
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity,
what
the
need
for
the
gas
will
be
during
the
period
between
certification
and
the
period
at
which
termination
is
proposed.
where
the
commission
determines
that
a
particular
sale
would
not
be
made
unless
advance
authority
is
granted,
it
seems
to
me
proper
for
it
to
consider
whether
the
need
for
the
gas
in
the
interim
is
sufficient
to
justify
giving
this
producer
the
advance
assurance
he
requests.
the
alternative
would
to
loose
the
gas
all
together,
assuming
that
the
commission’s
finding
is
correct
and
of
course
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
in
which
case
the
public
would
have
the
gas
both
during
and
after
the
period.
it
is
not
our
position
that
reads
section
7
(b)
as
a
separate
protection
out
of
the
act.
it
is
really
respondents,
because
without,
on
their
theory
the
limitations
upon
what
the
commission
can
properly
consider
mean
that
the
gas
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
be
attracted,
at
which
point
section
7
(b)
is
never
brought
into
effect,
because
there
is
never
any
gas
for
it
to
be
terminated.
in
any
event,
respondents’
speculation
about
what
the
commission
might
and
might
not
do
with
the
authority
that
it
asserts
and
how
it
might
not
exercise
it,
really
are
totally
premature.
the
commission
has
never
given
such
authority
under
this
order
and
has
denied
it
on
a
couple
of
occasions
and
the
proper
time,
it
seems
to
us
to
consider
whether
it
has
correctly
applied
the
statutory
standards,
is
in
a
concrete
case,
when
it
has
attempted
to
do
so.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
have
just
one
thought.
mr.
simons
has
relied
very
heavily
on
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
texaco
case,
small
producers
case
and
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
there
were
really
two
questions
before
the
court
in
texaco.
one
was
whether
it
was
proper
for
the
power
commission
to
engage
in
indirect
regulation
of
small
producers,
if
it
could
assure
just
and
reasonable
rates
through
that
process
and
the
attack
was
made
on
that
plan
on
the
ground
that
it
was
deregulation,
it
is
for
congress.
the
court
held
that
it
would
be
proper
if
the
commission
adequately
indicated
in
its
order
that
it
was
going
to
apply
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
question
that
the
order
in
this
case
applies
and
intends
to
apply
to
just
and
reasonable,
that
means
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
standards
of
this
statute.
there
are
no
similar
question
about
the
validity
of
the
order.
