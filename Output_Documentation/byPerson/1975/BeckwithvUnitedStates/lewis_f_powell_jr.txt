mr.

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
emphasizing
the
tax
nature
of
this
case,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
local
sheriff
had
dropped
in
to
this
residence
at
8
o’clock
in
the
morning
investigating
for
burglary?
and
the
petitioner
had
been
guest
in
the
house
and
the
sheriff
said
i
am
trying
to
find
out
who
committed
this
burglary
and
i
would
like
to
know
where
you
were
in
the
night
of
the
burglary.
he
gave
no
miranda
warnings.
i
suppose
he
did
say
what
was
said
in
this
case.
of
course,
nobody
has
to
speak.
we
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent.
that
will
be
a
non-tax
situation.
would
you
feel
that
is
different?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
case,
i
put
there
was
certainly
no
custody.
there
was
no
custodial
interrogation
but
you
view
this
case
as
involving
custodial
interrogation
because
it
is
a
tax
case.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
other
point
that
is
relevant
to
whether
or
not
this
was
custodial?
