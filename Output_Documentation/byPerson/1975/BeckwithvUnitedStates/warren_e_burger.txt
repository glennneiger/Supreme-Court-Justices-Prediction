we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
beckwith
against
the
united
states.
mr.
gill.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o’clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gill
you
may
continue.
you
have
27
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
that
affect
the
merits
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
he
might
just
blurt
out
the
truth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what
you
said,
if
anything
that
he
disclosed
is
not
supported
by
the
government’s
case
in
chief,
perhaps
it
is
not
all
that
relevant
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
not
have
to
read
all
those
statements
in
light
of
the
fact
so
the
miranda
case
that
it
was
a
police
station
and
they
all
relate
to
those
facts.
those
are
not
general
philosophical
observations
and
opinion,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
theory
then,
one
might
claim
that
if
a
policeman
stops
you
on
the
street
with
regard
your
walking
and
begins
to
ask
you
some
questions
that
you
are
unaccustomed
to
talking
to
a
policeman
in
a
uniform
with
a
badge
and
a
gun,
therefore,
although
miranda
warnings
must
apply
before
the
policeman
can
have
any
conversation
with
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
other
cases
but
you
are
taking
some
language
that
related
to
a
police
station
and
taking
it
out
of
context.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
author
of
the
opinion
talking
about?
it
was
talking
about
a
case
in
which
the
man
was
in
the
police
station,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
not
out
of
context
when
you
are
taking
out
of
a
police
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
crampton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,

the
case
is
submitted.
