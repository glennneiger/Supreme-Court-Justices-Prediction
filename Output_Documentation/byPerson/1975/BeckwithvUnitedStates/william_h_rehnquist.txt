well,
an
absent
of
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
which
prohibits
compulsory
self-incrimination,
i
presume
society
has
an
interest
in
seeing
guilty
defendants
incriminate
themselves
so
long
as
it
is
voluntary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly,
the
man
has
it
within
his
power
to
say
i
do
not
remember,
i
do
not
know?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
specifically,
i
think
the
holding
there
might
have
been
the
explicit
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
does
not
begin
constitutionally
until
there
is
an
indictment
or
other
charge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
think
it
affected.
i
do
not
think
it
had
much
to
do
with
the
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
always
critical
if
something
happen
to
hurt
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
always
a
critical
moment
if
at
that
moment
something
happens
to
prejudice
to.
