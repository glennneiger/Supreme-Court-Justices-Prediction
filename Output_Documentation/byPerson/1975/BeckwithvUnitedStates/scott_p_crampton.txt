mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
briefly
certain
facts
that
we
believe
to
be
salient
here.
first
the
age
is
44
years
of
age.
he
was
a
manager
of
a
liquor
store.
he
was
the
secretary
treasurer
of
the
corporation.
he
had
stipulated
taxable
income
that
he
had
spent
of
$24,600.00
while
his
return
had
reported
$10,000.00.
counsel
speaks
of
the
complexity
of
the
tax
laws.
i
do
not
think
that
complexity
really
is
pertinent
here.
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
$24,000.00
of
income
that
he
could
spend.
they
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
cash
on
hand
in
various
periods
of
time
beginning
of
each
year.
i
do
not
think
it
is
unreasonable
to
ask
a
person
whether
he
had
$300.00
or
$400.00
on
hand
at
any
given
time
or
whether
he
had
$10,000.00
or
$15,000.00
on
hand.
they
asked
him
if
he
had
any
inheritances,
any
gifts
and
he
said
he
did
not.
as
far
as
the
meeting
itself
was
concerned,
he
went
upstairs
to
finish
dressing
after
he
knew
who
was
here
to
visit
him.
the
agents
exhibited
their
badges
and
their
credentials.
he
was
given
the
customary
internal
revenue
service
warning
which
advised
him
that
the
agents
could
not
compel
answers
to
information
that
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
and
that
his
answers
might
be
use
against
him
in
a
criminal
proceeding
and
furthermore
and
quite
significant
i
believe,
he
was
told
that
he
could
have
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
before
responding
and
he
admitted
in
his
own
testimony
that
he
did
have
an
attorney
accountant
that
it
prepared
his
returns
so
that
he
knew
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
have
that
man
in
prison.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
the
significant
part,
this
court
please
was
that
he
had
an
attorney.
he
was
told
he
can
bring
him
in
and
he
elected
not
to.
i
mean
i
do
not
think
that
to
me
takes
away
from
a
compulsion—
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
it
shows
that
the
agents
and
the
internal
revenue
service
position
was
to
in
effect
comply
with
the
least
philosophy
of
miranda
and
let
this
people
know
they
could
do
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
it
is
not
but
i
am
saying
we
did
it.
i
think
it
was—
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well
the
significance
as
i
say
i
think
is
that
he
had
the
counsel
and
he
did
not
elect
to
bring
him
in.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
another
thing
is
he
testified
at
the
trial
he
had
understood
the
warning
and
he
also
said
that
he
was
asked
by
the
agents
to
read
the
warning
out
loud
and
then
he
did
that.
the
agents
described
the
interview
as
friendly
and
the
defense
counsel
agreed
in
his
argument
to
the
court
that
it
was
friendly
and
the
defendant
in
his
own
testimony
referred
to
the
parties
as
cracking
jokes
and
laughing.
they
later
went
to
the
liquor
store
to
obtain
some
records.
they
went
in
separate
cars.
i
think
there
was
a
45-minute
interval
there
and
at
that
time
he
delivered
the
books
and
records
after
again
being
told
that
he
did
not
have
to
do
so.
the
defendant
also
said
that
he
chose
not
to
answer
certain
questions
that
were
asked
to
him
and
and
that
he
was
not
pressed
by
the
agents
for
his
answer.
after
hearing
the
testimony
of
the
two
agents
and
the
petitioner
here,
the
district
court
found
he
is
entitled
to
it,
the
miranda
warning
when
the
court
finds
as
a
fact
that
there
were
custodial
circumstances.
i
have
to
find
a
situation
that
required
it
and
i
find
on
this
record
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
such
situation.
then
later
he
went
on
he
said
he
knew
he
could
have
a
lawyer
and
he
knew
that
he
did
not
have
to
say
anything
to
them.
and
finally,
i
find
from
the
evidence
and
it
is
uncontradicted
that
his
basic
rights
were
in
fact
explained
to
him.
when
the
case
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
court
said
in
part
there
is
no
claim
that
beckwith
mental
condition
or
education
were
so
limited
that
he
was
particularly
susceptible
to
interrogation.
the
entire
interview
was
free
of
coercion.
it
was
also
noted
by
the
circuit
court
that
the
defendant
was
complaining
at
the
meeting
he
was
so
friendly
that
he
was
deceived
into
believing
that
he
was
not
incriminating
himself.
the
defendant
apparently
contends
that
this
was
a
criminal
case
from
the
outset
and
that
he
should
have
had
the
full
miranda
warnings.
as
we
understand
his
position,
he
wants
to
extend
miranda
far
beyond
the
custodial
circumstances
considered
in
that
opinion.
at
the
outset,
we
dispute
his
basic
premise
that
the
case
was
criminal
from
the
outset.
the
case
originated
from
information
furnished
by
an
informant.
in
1972,
the
internal
revenue
service
initially
screened
132
allegations
of
fraud.
only
8,000
of
these
were
actually
resulted
in
an
investigation
and
out
of
the
8,000
only
prosecution
was
not
recommended
in
7,000.
thus,
seven
out
of
eight
cases
ended
up
as
civil
matters.
the
actual
prosecutions
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
1,000.
taxpayer’s
brief
even
says
that
seven
out
of
eight
cases
were
not
prosecuted
so
that
when
this
case
started,
no
one
could
say
this
was
going
to
be
a
criminal
case
at
the
outset.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
do
not
think
it
would
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
got
several
arguments.
but
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
the
taxpayer
was
not
as
in
the
same
situation
as
one
who
was
under
arrest.
the
self-incrimination
clause
as
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
the
miranda
court
found
the
compulsion
to
exist
from
the
custodial
circumstances.
here,
as
i
say,
the
district
court
found
none
and
as
we
read
this
court’s
opinion
in
schneckloth
versus
bustamonte,
the
miranda
warnings
do
not
reach
an
investigative
questioning
of
a
person
not
in
custody.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
the
record
does
not
say
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
they
were
there
three
hours
is
some
indication
that
there
was
an
extended
discussion
alright.
but
i
did
not
see
anything
in
the
record
of
that
type
of
testimony.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
this
man
said
he
started
work
at
7:30
and
he
knew
when
the
man
went
to
the
liquor
store
apparently
and
so
he
was
there
to
meet
him.
taxpayer
argues
that
the
interview
with
the
internal
revenue’s
agent
had
a
psychological
coercive
effect
upon
the
taxpayer.
but
as
the
chief
justice
i
think
has
already
indicated
that
same
thing
could
be
said
of
the
police
officer
who
stops
the
nervous
housewife.
she
certainly
does
not
have
to
--
he
does
not
have
to
give
her
a
miranda
warning
before
asking
to
see
the
driver’s
license.
the
defendant
talks
of
a
warning
needed
when
the
case
reaches
the
accusatory
stage
and
since
only
one
case
out
of
132
ripens
into
an
indictment,
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
when
such
a
nebulous
test
would
be
applied.
it
seems
to
us
that
short
of
a
reference
of
the
case
from
the
internal
revenue
service
to
the
department
of
justice,
the
question
ends
where
to
draw
the
line
and
we
think
that
this
court
has
drawn
on
appropriate
line
when
they
talk
about
the
custodial
circumstances.
this
is
a
rule
adapted
in
10
out
of
the
11
circuit.
all
but
the
seventh,
this
counsel
has
noted.
the
defendant
argues
to
the
contrary
but
his
basic
authorities
are
some
law
review
articles
and
articles
and
case
notes
and
we
submit
that
the
reasoning
of
the
various
circuit
courts
that
have
considered
this
is
by
far
more
persuasive.
finally,
if
a
warning
is
deemed
to
be
necessary,
it
seems
that
the
one
given
here
was
sufficient.
it
warned
him
of
possible
criminal
consequences
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
incriminate
himself
and
that
he
could
have
an
attorney.
it
felt
short
of
the
miranda
warning
in
two
regards,
one
with
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
second
the
right
to
an
appointed
attorney.
we
submit
in
tax
cases
that
the
law
requires
records
to
be
kept
and
returns
to
be
filed
and
if
taxpayers
could
always
remain
silent,
the
self-assessment
system
would
be
seriously
undermined.
it
also
seems
clear
that
there
is
no
need
to
offer
appointed
counsel
at
the
time
of
each
investigation.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
to
my
knowledge
they
still
give
just
a
warning
that
was
given
here.
apparently,
there
was
some
conflict
throughout
the
country
as
to
what
was
being
done.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
internal
revenue
service
issued
this
requirement
and
as
far
as
i
know
one
is
still
in
effect
and
they
are
still
using
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
seventh
circuit
really
stands
alone
in
requiring
internal
revenue
service
to
go
that
far.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
read
about
it
in
the
papers.
it
is
some
report
that
may
be
saying
that
a
lot
of
people
have
difficulties
with
the
examinations
by
the
internal
revenue
service
i
guess.
i
do
not
really
think
that
is
very
new
or
very
important.
everybody
knows
that
but
the
way
to
avoid
that
is
to—
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
apparently,
some
group
has
been
working
for
several
years
in
building
a
report
that
was
to
be,
i
think,
discussed
with
the
internal
revenue
service
to
see
if
changes
could
be
made
somewhere
along
in
their
administration.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes,
there
were
several
commissioners
of
internal
revenue
rolled
in
and
saying
that
they
thought
that
the
publicity
given
had
not
been
a
fair
appraisal
of
but
i
do
remember
that.
