thurgood
marshall
mr.
crampton,
if
these
agents
gave
him
that
usual
feel
that
you
tell
me
this
so
i
can
get
it
some
other
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
glad
to
see
some
government
officers
that
work
at
8
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning.
they
get
up
that
early
all
the
time.
you
know
you
could
be
waking
the
man
up
and
dragging
him
in
the
room.
