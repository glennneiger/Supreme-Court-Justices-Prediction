mr.
john
g.

jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
represent
alvin
beckwith,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
we
are
here
seeking
a
reversal
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
affirmance
of
his
conviction
on
one
count
of
attempting
to
evade
and
deceit
federal
income
taxes.
we
feel
that
the
trial
court
should
have
been
reversed
or
should
be
reversed
because
it
committed
error
in
denying
the
petitioner’s
pre-trial
motion
to
suppress
statements
made
to
special
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
at
a
crucial
august
2,
1972
interview
which
provided
the
entire
starting
point
for
the
net
worth
or
expenditure
circumstantial
evidence,
theory
of
prosecution
and
without
which
we
believe
the
prosecution
below
would
not
have
been
able
to
proceed.
the
facts
brought
out
at
that
pre-trial
motion
to
suppress,
the
trial
took
place
on
a
stipulated
record
after
denial
of
the
motion
to
suppress
took
the
form
of
the
testimony
of
two
special
agents
of
the
intelligence
division,
the
criminal
division
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
those
agents
testified
that
in
march
of
1972,
they
received
a
tip
from
an
informant
that
mr.
beckwith,
the
petitioner
was
not
reporting
all
of
his
income
taxes.
during
the
next
three
months,
they
testified,
they
did
a
considerable
amount
of
investigation
into
his
background,
into
his
family,
and
indeed
into
specific
transactions.
on
august
2,
1972,
unannounced
at
8
a.m.
in
the
morning,
they
arrived
at
the
home
of
a
friend
in
silver
spring,
maryland
where
the
petitioner
was
staying.
the
petitioner
had
to
finish
dressing
and
when
he
went
into
the
dining
room
for
three
hours,
between
8
a.m.
and
11
a.m.,
prior
to
questioning,
the
agents
read
to
him
from
a
card
certain
advice
of
rights
which
is
concededly
short
of
the
warnings
required
by
miranda
versus
arizona
if
that
case
is
held
to
apply
to
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
you
honor.(lunch
break)
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
was
to
the
point
where
i
had
mentioned
that
limited
warnings
had
been
given
to
petitioner.
during
the
next
three
hours,
the
agents
questioned
him
about
a
number
of
things
which
significantly
are
incorporated
into
stipulation
number
two
which
made
up
the
starting
point
for
the
net
worth
prosecution.
sources
of
possible
nontaxable
income
during
the
year
1971,
cash
on
hands
going
all
the
way
back,
i
believe
in
1965
or
at
least
1967
and
other
items
through
which
they
buttoned
down
the
starting
point
for
the
prosecution.
the
agents
testified
that
his
liquor
store
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
to
opened
at
10:30
and
the
petitioner
sent
the
person
with
whom
he
was
staying
who
was
also
an
employee
at
the
liquor
store
to
open
the
store.
thereafter,
after
the
interview,
he
went
and
produced
certain
records
from
the
liquor
store
to
the
agents
without
any
warrant
or
summons.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
44
years
of
age.
he
had
a
ninth
grade
education.
he
knew
very
little
about
tax
returns
and
this
was
corroborated
by
the
observations
of
the
agents
during
their
testimony.
he
testified
that
he
had
never
filed
or
prepared
an
income
tax
return
his
entire
life—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
in
the
waiver
context
your
honor,
it
shows
what
needed
for
warnings
there
are
because
indeed
there
was
absolutely
no
knowing
waiver.
this
case
is
perhaps
a
graphic
illustration.
this
person
testified
h
had
no
idea
he
was
incriminating
himself.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
our
position
your
honor,
of
course
is
that
the
situation
was
coercive
from
a
legal
and
psychological
point
of
view.
i
say
this
in
the
context
of
emphasizing
the
need
for
counsel,
the
need
for
an
effective
warning
as
he
was
right
to
remain
silent.
i
do
not
know
if
the
truth
or
the
non-truth
of
it
is
significant
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
this
particular
type
of
statements
that
were
being
elicited
from
him
though
was
specifically
recognized
by
this
court
in
holland
versus
united
states
to
be
probably
unreliable
or
in
many
cases.
point
number
five
of
the
holland
opinion
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
says,
in
this
type
of
an
interview,
a
taxpayer
is
more
often
concerned
with
a
quick
settlement
or
a
placating
the
agents
than
reliability.
if
i
could
pick
up
that
question
your
honor,
what
one
of
us
here
including
myself
could
go
back
four
or
five
years
and
tell
how
much
cash
we
had
on
hand
with
reliability?
i
think
there
was
a
great
potential
for
unreliability
here.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
there
could
be
arguments
made
as
a
matter
of
weight
but
again,
as
this
court
recognized
in
holland,
the
government
agents
can
pick
and
choose
among
the
good
and
the
bad
and
used
them
against
him
as
part
of
admissions
of
trial.
a
very
incriminating,
i
think
especially
in
this
situation.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
did
not
recall
the
word
criminal
being
used
by
the
agents.
they
testified,
they
told
him
one
of
their
functions
was
to
investigate
criminal
tax
fraud,
the
possibility
of
criminal
tax
fraud.
he
also
testified.
he
did
not
think
he
had
incriminated
himself
at
all
during
the
three-hour
interview.
we
feel
that
the
decision
below
and
the
requirement
of
actual
physical
restraint
and
custody
is
improper
for
miranda
purposes,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
we
feel
in
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
indeed
a
criminal
case.
at
the
beginning
of
his
oral
opinion,
the
district
judge
which
has
found
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
1b,
he
found
in
fact,
it
was
criminal
from
the
very
beginning
and
his
finding
we
feel
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
there
were
approximately
three
months
of
investigation
of
the
petitioner
prior
to
the
interview.
we
feel
it
is
supported
by
what
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
for
the
district
of
columbia
issued
in
the
form
of
a
press
release.
at
the
time
of
indictment,
they
said
petitioner
was
the
subject
of
legal
harassment
by
virtue
of
the
prosecution
of
the
tax
laws
against
those
who
they
felt
were
involved
in
narcotic
underworld
activity.
the
obvious
implication
we
feel
being
unprovable
narcotic
activity
and
we
point
out
that
petitioner
has
no
record
for
such
activity.
also,
the
arrest
was
affected
by
the
combined
forces
of
internal
revenue
agents
and
the
bureau
of
narcotic
and
dangerous
drug
agents.
we
also
feel
that
in
addition
to
being
clearly
a
criminal
case
at
the
time
of
the
interview,
this
was
indeed
a
critical
stage.
we
have
already
made
reference
to
holland
versus
united
states.
that
court
recognizes
and
this
type
of
prosecution.
the
starting
point
is
crucial
to
the
government.
in
fact
without
it,
i
do
not
think
they
have
any
case
and
i
think
it
has
been
virtually
conceded
throughout
the
court
so
far
that
they
need
that
starting
point
which
came
entirely
out
of
petitioner’s
own
mouth.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
of
the
specific
language;
i
know
that
was
in
the
line-up
area.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
said
critical,
i
think
and
perhaps
in
miranda
terms
and
the
values
that
miranda
sought
to
protect
against
specifically
the
fifth
amendment
value.
and
maybe,
i
am
using
critical,
if
you
take
that
as
a
term
of
art
that
was
dealt
within
kirby
versus
illinois
with
respect
to
counsel.
but
for
this
prosecution,
this
type
of
prosecution,
i
feel
it
was
indeed
critical.
we
feel
--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
and
your
honor,
i
think
this
was
not
just
one
bit
of
evidence.
this
was
the
whole
starting
point
which
is
totally
necessary
to
this
entirely
circumstantial
type
of
prosecution.
we
feel
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuits
requirement
of
the
necessity
for
a
finding
of
physical
restraint
is
particularly
inappropriate
for
a
tax
prosecution.
we
focused
on
the
language
which
at
least
four
times
was
repeated
in
miranda.
it
said
“custody
or
otherwise
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
action
in
any
significant
way.”
we
say
custody
is
inappropriate
for
tax
case
because
arrest
or
the
taking
a
person
into
physical
restraint
by
the
government
is
a
matter
that
is
foreign
to
the
tax
prosecution
in
most
cases.
we
have
quoted
the
law
review
commentators
who
say,
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
tax
prosecutions
knows
that
arrest
does
not
have
much
significance
if
it
happens
at
all.
usually,
the
experience
i
submit
is
that
the
tax
violator
first
comes
into
physical
restraint
or
custody
when
these
appellate
remedies
are
exhausted
and
he
surrenders
to
the
marshals.
this
is
so
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it
is
not
a
crime
of
violence;
the
government
does
not
have
any
interest
in
getting
the
man
off
the
street
for
the
protection
of
others.
once
the
agents
have
come
to
look
at
its
returns,
the
crime
is
not
likely
to
be
repeated.
there
is
not
much
possibility
of
flight
because
of
the
business
connected
geographically
orientated
type
of
business
activity
often
associated
with
income
tax.
and
the
investigations
take
a
long
time
as
exhibited
by
this
case
and
focused
for
a
long
time.
also,
identity
is
not
an
issue
at
all
in
a
tax
violation.
the
terms
in
miranda,
the
police
do
not
when
they
are
making
there
general
on
the
scene
fast
moving
investigation
have
to
give
warnings
to
the
people
they
talk
to.
i
think
it
is
directed
when
you
analyze
it
towards
who
committed
the
crime.
in
the
average
criminal
context,
a
crime
is
reported
in
the
law
enforcement
officers
to
go
out
to
find
out
who
did
it
and
who
is
responsible,
let
us
bring
him
to
justice.
in
a
tax
prosecution,
it
is
different.
you
know
who
did
it.
his
name
is
at
the
bottom-line
of
the
return.
there
is
no
question,
identity
is
immediately
apparent
so
there
is
no
need
for
a
fast
moving
investigation.
it
could
be
inhibited
by
the
warnings,
we
ask
to
attach
in
the
criminal
context
here.
in
this
case,
the
crime
was
reported
three
or
four
month
before
in
march
of
1972.
they
knew
the
existence
of
the
crime,
there
was
no
question
of
identity,
they
knew
where
to
go,
they
knew
who
to
talk
to,
they
were
building
a
case.
we
feel
the
formal
accusatory
stage,
perhaps
not
as
formal
as
an
indictment
but
virtual
or
punitive,
this
man
was
a
defendant,
he
was
not
accused
and
we
asked
for
the
accuse’
right
to
self-incrimination
just
in
the
same
sense
that
miranda
sought
to
protect
it.
now,
we
recognize
of
course
that
coercion
is
necessary
for
fifth
amendment
violation
and
for
requirements
for
these
prophylactic
miranda
type
warnings
to
ensure
voluntary
waiver
to
ensure
that
the
person’s
right
to
refrain
from
compelling
himself
is
not
trampled
upon.
we
feel
that
during
a
tax
investigation,
there
are
such
legal
and
psychological
pressures
at
play
that
a
taxpayer
is
coerced
to
speak
that
in
the
language
of
miranda
his
freedom
of
action,
freedom
of
choice
is
significantly
restraint.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
case
must
be
viewed
against
the
repetitive
experience
of
a
person.
he
knows
without
specific
request
that
every
april
15th
or
more
often
during
the
year,
he
has
to
tell
himself.
talked
to
the
internal
revenue
to
his
pecuniary
detriment,
pay
his
taxes
as
a
civil
obligation
as
a
responsible
citizen.
and
he
does
that
and
most
people
in
the
united
states
do
that
without
compulsion.
we
submit
there
is
a
heightened
compulsion
when
the
representative
of
the
internal
revenue
commissioner
actually
visits
your
home
to
talk
to
you.
he
is
there
for
some
where
we
used
to
telling
on
ourselves.
most
significant,
i
feel,
for
purposes
of
miranda
requirements
is
the
fact
of
the
complexity
of
the
tax
laws.
you
take
the
internal
revenue
code
and
just
look
at
it.
take
the
regulations
that
are
authorized
by
that
code
which
set
up
civil
obligations
and
look
at
it.
it
is
a
morass
of
complexity
to
the
average
citizen.
it
is
i
submit
complex
to
the
average
attorney
who
is
not
an
expert
in
tax
law.
we—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well
it
would
depend
on
a
few
more
circumstances,
i
think
your
honor.
just
as
you
have
given
it
yes,
because
the
person,
i
think
you
said
a
burglary
in
your
hypothetical
mr.
justice
powell.
the
person
who
is
confronted
to
answer
questions
about
a
burglary,
he
has
an
orientation
if
he
is
of
average
intelligence.
now,
i
know
there
are
legal
technicalities
as
was
evidenced
by
the
escobedo
case
where
he
said,
i
did
not
do
it,
you
did
it,
and
exhibited
some
knowledge.
but
generally
speaking,
the
person
or
the
citizen
under
investigation
for
an
average
on
the
street
crime
has
a
familiarity.
there
is
just
no
starting
point.
this
is
the
great
unknown
in
the
tax.
it
is
so
complex
and
terribly
frightening
to
the
taxpayer
because
it
is
so
unknown.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
main
points.
the
subject
matter.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
the
combination
and
confusion
in
the
mind
of
taxpayers
as
to
his
civil
obligations
and
his
criminal
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
decline
to
incriminate
himself.
and
another
point,
theories
that
i
will
develop
throughout
my
argument
but
if
i
could—
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
significant.
miranda
quoted
a
different
place
is
the
concern
and
the
need
for
these
warnings
in
the
following
language.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
defendant
was
thrust
into
an
unfamiliar
atmosphere.
the
tax
laws
as
subject
matter
of
the
tax
laws
we
submit
is
a
terribly
unfamiliar
atmosphere.
miranda
in
other
point
uses
an
individual
swept
from
familiar
surroundings.
now
maybe
the
dining
room
of
that
friend’s
home
was
nothing
like
the
back
room
of
the
police
station.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
think
they
are,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
a
policy—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
i
think
miranda
itself
sought
not
to
include
that.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
though.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
respectfully
submit,
i
am
not
your
honor
because
it
was
this
concern
with
being
swept
away
from
any
focal
point
in
which
to
make
an
intelligent
choice.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
if
you
analyze
it
just
from
its
facts,
i
agree
your
honor
but
i
think
--
for
purposes
of
my
presentation
here,
i
think
it
is
a
good
analogy.
the
complexity
of
the
subject
matter
has
put
this
person
into
an
unfamiliar
atmosphere
the
equivalent
we
feel
of
a
police
station.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
in
many
cases,
yes
your
honor.
however,
the
distinction
is
this.
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
jeopardized
in
the
way
it
is
here.
the
transfer
has
been
made
or
there
was
no
transfer
in
this
case
as
when
unusual
case
and
the
defendant
was
a
target
initiated
with
the
special
agents.
his
fifth
amendment
rights
are
in
jeopardy.
i
do
not
think
this
court
in
miranda
sought
to
protect
people
who
are
not
likely
to
be
charged
in
a
criminal
case
and
convict
themselves
out
of
their
own
mouth
interrogation
of
their
fifth
amendment
right
to
refrain
from
self-incrimination.
what
is
different
here
is
these
agents
were
at
the
time
of
the
interview
building
a
case
against
the
petitioner
in
order
to
convict
him.
and
therefore
the
heightened
need
for
warnings.
yes,
your
honor,
some
of
my
arguments
to
apply
in
the
civil
context.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
he
was
given
a
warming
that
might
be
appropriate
to
give
a
non-target
defendant
summoned
before
the
grand
jury.
it
is
the
difference
between
the
defendant
privilege
in
a
criminal
case
and
the
witness
privilege,
this
is
why
i
make
and
emphasize.
this
was
a
criminal
case
being
built
against
mr.
beckwith.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
your
honor,
under
miranda—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
take
issue
with
whether
or
not
there
was
an
effective
advice
of
the
right
to
counsel.
he
was
told,
i
advice
you
further
that
you
may
if
you
wish
to
seek
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
before
responding.
i
admit
this
has
some
superficial
appeal
when
the
government
argues.
he
was
effectively
warned
but
when
you
think
of
it
in
terms
of
a
close
analysis
of
the
requirements
that
the
court
set
down
in
miranda
and
against
this
situation
the
jeopardy
was
in,
i
think
you
can
see
that
advice.
i
advise
you
further
you
may
if
you
wish
to
seek
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
before
responding.
it
sounds
when
you
analyze
it
like
he
might
make
one
phone
call.
miranda
made
it
clear
that—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
he
had
the
right
to
be
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
attorney
with
him
during
questioning.
this
takes
on
heightened
importance
because
the
agent
here
had
his
tax
return
there
for
him
to
go
over.
in
effect—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
do
not
know
if
he
mentioned
it
at
first.
he
was
not
told
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
i
think
he
was
not
effectively
told
of
his
right
to
consult
with
an
attorney.
it
was
watered
down.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes
i
am,
your
honor.
the
government—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
that
was
not
developed
on
the
record
below.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well
your
honor,
no
i
think
we
are
in
a
situation
where
a
person
is
being
investigated
for
not
paying
his
taxes.
i
think
a
legitimate
inference
is
that
the
taxes
are
not
being
paid
because
he
do
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
them.
the
government’s
argument
that
tax
cases
are
present
where
there
is
a
lot
of
money
involved,
i
do
not
think
holds
up
because
there
is
that
distinct
possibility.
people
are
not
paying
their
taxes
because
they
do
not
have
funds.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
millionaires
are
advised
as
well.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
if
i
could
point
out
two
more
factors
which
we
feel
enter
into
the
coercive
atmosphere
here.
first,
the
government’s
brief
at
page
32
indicates
this
quite
succinctly.
they
say
indeed,
the
petitioner
had
to
answer
the
agent’s
questions
any
way
ultimately
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
as
long
as
it
would
not
incriminate
him.
the
seventh
circuit
which
has
on
these
specific
warnings
in
judge
stevens’
opinion
in
oliver
versus
the
united
states
found
that
full
miranda
warnings
had
to
be
given
in
the
statement
thus
had
to
be
suppressed.
it
has
held
that
there
is
confusion
here
between
his
civil
obligations
and
his
rights
in
a
criminal
case.
this
is
precisely
the
point.
the
person
thinks
he
has
a
compulsion.
there
are
specific
internal
revenue
code
provisions
compelling
him
to
provide
records,
make
statements,
and
give
anything
the
secretary
wants
in
the
way
of
information.
he
does
not
know
unless
he
is
effectively
warned
and
he
cannot
make
an
intelligent
decision.
secondly,
from
the
point
view
of
coercion,
there
is
a
compulsion.
he
is
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
whirlpool
we
submit
the
agents
of
their
seeking
information.
he
knows
that
if
he
does
not
talk
to
them,
he
will
be
subjected
to
a
full
scale
audit.
what
form
does
this
take?
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
but
a
criminal
case—
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
you
might
generally
speaking.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
however,
when
these
agents
visit
him
to
interrogate
him
or
asking
questions
and
they
are
building
a
criminal
case
against
him,
he
is
under
a
compulsion
that
derives
from
the
fact
that
he
knows
he
will
be
subjected
to
a
full
scale
audit.
socially
embarrassing
when
contacts
are
made
with
your
clients,
your
friends,
your
customers,
and
your
creditors
potentially
because
the
taxpayer
in
almost
all
matters
has
the
burden
of
proof
potentially
very
expensive,
if
those
agents
are
dissatisfied
and
they
assess
the
deficiency.
these
pressures
we
feel
are
at
his
mind
and
this
is
what
has
been
recognized
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
on
a
whole,
the
analysis
is
that
there
are
such
pressures
both
from
a
civil
legal
point
of
view,
confusion,
complexity,
that
the
taxpayer
must
be
warned
of
the
full
rights
under
miranda
or
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
think
it
is
pointed
out,
if
this
court
takes
note
of
two
cases,
malloy
versus
hogan
and
holland
versus
the
united
states.
under
the
warning
that
was
given
here,
how
could
a
person
in
petition
circumstances,
a
ninth
grade
dropout
ever
know
that
incriminate
yourself
had
the
broad
meaning
of
malloy
versus
hogan.
how
could
he
know
that
by
telling
him
how
much
cash
he
had
on
hand
a
few
years
back
could
incriminate
him
in
the
complex-type
of
prosecution
that
was
being
built
against
him?
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
mention
one
more
thing
--
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
well,
i
think
perhaps
there
never
could
be
a
fully
intelligent
waiver
counsel
without
--
however,
if
you
were
told
your
honor
of
the
absolute
right
to
remain
silent,
that
could
potentially
have
had
much
more
meaning
and
had
heightened
necessity
because
of
these
factors
i
point
out.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
your
honor
that
is
intervened
between
the
submissions
of
briefs
here.
i
found
out
about
it
5
o’clock
friday.
united
states
government
organization,
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
has
done
a
very
exhaustive
study
of
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws,
i
have
not
reviewed
it.
i
have
seen
a
summary
of
it.
i
feel
contained
therein
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
support
for
petitioner’s
argument
here.
i
do
not
think
the
case
should
stand
or
fall
on
that
but
i
call
of
its
existence
as
not
quite
in
final
form.
all
of
the
recommendations
have
not
been
made
but
i
think
this
court
should
be
aware
of
his
existence
in
the
same
type
the
miranda
court
looked
at
certain
reports
in
the
area
miranda
was
concerned
with.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
your
honor?
mr.
john
g.
gill,
jr.
it
is
not
available
generally
at
the
report
in
itself.
summaries
are
available
at
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
20-21
elf
street

i
believe
it
is.
thank
you.
