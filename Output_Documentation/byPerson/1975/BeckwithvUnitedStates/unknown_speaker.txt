did
we
not
hold
that
kirby
against
illinois
that
the
critical
stage
did
not
begin
until
there
was
an
indictment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gill
are
you
drawing
any
distinction
between
a
call
by
an
ordinary
revenue
agent
if
i
may
so
describe
him
and
a
special
agent
in
the
intelligence
division?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
entire
argument
though
is
directed
to
a
tax
consultation.
is
there
not
as
much
fear
and
trembling
when
the
first
agent
shows
up
and
so
there
is
one
the
second
one?
unknown
speaker
what
specifically
--
what
prejudice
did
he
suffer
by
the
so-called
defects
in
the
warnings
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
specifically,
what
i
like
to
have
you
answer
is
what
was
he
entitled
to
that
he
did
not
get
by
way
of
specific
questions
here?
unknown
speaker
one
is
the
fact
he
was
not
told
he
could
remain
silent.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
he
was
told
he
could
have
counsel.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
other
given
--
what
other
right
was
he
entitled
to
be
told
about
but
he
did
not
get?
unknown
speaker
any
other
rights?
unknown
speaker
any
other
rights?
unknown
speaker
your
not
making
any
claim
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney,
if
he
or
to
be
told
he
could
have
an
attorney
if
he
could
not
afford
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
claim
of
indigency
here?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
paid
appeal,
is
it
not?
is
not
this
is
a
paid
appeal?
unknown
speaker
but
no
claim
of
indigency
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
in
a
true
miranda
situation
in
a
conventional
plain
of
a
miranda
situation
where
person
is
in
custody
in
a
police
station
being
interrogated
by
the
police.
the
duty
of
the
police
to
warn
him
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
state
expense
if
he
cannot
afford
one
is
certainly
not
predicated
upon
a
preliminary
finding
of
indigency
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
is
an
absolute
duty
under
the
miranda
case?
unknown
speaker
precisely.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
fact
of
life
that
every
taxpayer
is
confronted
with
constantly?
unknown
speaker
do
you
need
a
warning
just
before
you
sign
your
tax
return?
unknown
speaker
so
you
might
be
incriminating
yourself?
unknown
speaker
like
many
people
do
incriminate
themselves
when
they
sign
their
tax
returns
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
available?
unknown
speaker
what
you
found
out
about
friday
evening?
unknown
speaker
so
general
crampton
you
say
you
think
that
is
quite
significant?
you
are
not
implying
that
you
think
that
was
constitutionally
necessary,
are
you?
that
warning?
unknown
speaker
well
then
why
is
it
significant?
unknown
speaker
well
then
are
you
implying
that
had
that
statement
not
been
made
to
him
there
would
have
been
a
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
well
then
why
is
it
significant?
unknown
speaker
well
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
implying
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
comply
with
the
philosophy
of
miranda
and
i
did
not
understand
your
argument
to
be
that.
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
do
not
see
why
it
is
significant
if
i
may
say
so?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
crampton,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
is
the
routine
used
today
by
special
agents.
do
they
give
miranda
warnings
now
in
consultations
before
they
start
now?
unknown
speaker
and
the
build
up
of
the
seventh
circuit
line
of
cases
has
not
changed
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
administrative
development
that
mr.
gill
told
us
about
friday
evening?
unknown
speaker
why
was
it
news
in
the
papers?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
letters
to
the
editor
criticizing
one
newspaperâ€™s
treatment
of
it
too
were
they
not
from
the
head
of
the
administrative
procedure
commission
and
from
the
former
commission
of
internal
revenue?
