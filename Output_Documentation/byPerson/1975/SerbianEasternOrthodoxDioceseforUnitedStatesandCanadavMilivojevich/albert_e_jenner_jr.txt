mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
first
time
i
am
on
church
case.
a
review
of
a
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
in
our
petition
we
charge
that
that
decision
of
that
court
violated
the
first
amendment,
the
separation
of
church
and
the
state
provisions
and
the
right
of
free
exercise
of
religion.
may
i
say
that,
mr.
justice
walter
schaefer
did
not
participate
in
that
decision,
having
excused
himself
because
of
the
fact
that
his
son-in-law
is
one
of
the
partners
in
our
firm?
now,
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
in
this
case
and
i
will
have
to
recite
some
basic
facts,
i
know
the
court
has
studied
the
briefs,
but
to
put
the
two
issues
in
perspective
that
is
the
issue
of
the
suspension,
demotion,
a
removal
and
then
defrockment
of
the
bishop
dionisije
as
to
one
and
secondly
the
reorganization
of
the
diocese
and
to
three
dioceses
relating
to
organizational
matters,
the
discipline
of
the
bishop
dionisije,
the
discipline
area
as
distinguished
from
organization
area.
now,
the
illinois
supreme
court
construed
the
constitutions
of
the
church,
the
mother
church,
the
serbian
orthodox
church
and
of
the
diocese
of
the
united
states
and
canada
and
construed
the
penal
code,
various
regulations
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church,
the
mother
church
which
by
the
way
all
courts
have
said
we
have
considered
this
matter,
including
the
illinois
supreme
court
as
a
true
hierarchical
church
and
i
will
spend
no
time
on
that
unless
that
issue
is
raised
in
the
reply
argument.
in
construing
those
internal
regulations
and
the
constitution,
the
illinois
supreme
court
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
not
and
that
is
included
in
the
briefs
that
we
have
filed
to
which
i
will
point,
i
hope
during
the
course
of
my
argument.
in
that
result
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
having
looked
into
the
regulations,
looked
into
and
construed
them
differently
from
the
way
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
which
is
the
highest
diocese
authority
in
the
serbian
orthodox
church
and
held
that
the
defrockment
of
bishop
dionisije,
his
suspension
in
may
1963,
his
demotion
or
removal
as
a
bishop
of
the
diocese
in
the
summer
of
1963
was
arbitrary
action
within
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
gonzalez
case
of
which
you,
mr.
justice
brennan
were
the
author
on
behalf
of
the
full
court.
so
that
the
net
result
of
the
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
to
restore
as
a
bishop
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church,
this
suspended,
removed,
and
defrocked
person
and
as
to
the
reorganization
of
the
diocese
that
the
court
just
says
out
of
hand
without
citing
any
authority
whatsoever,
not
a
single
authority,
that
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
may,
despite
the
fact
that
is
the
highest
body
in
the
church
and
despite
the
fact
that
only
it
and
only
it
might
create
dioceses
and
only
it
may
end
the
diocese,
only
it
may
reorganize
the
diocese,
that
is
article
16
of
the
church
constitution
that
that
was
improper
action.
now
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
and
only
it
as
your
honor
has
stated,
that
is
absolutely
right,
the
only
body
in
this
orthodox
church.
it
is
one
of
14
great
worldwide
orthodox
churches
and
only
--
the
constitution
provides,
the
constitution
of
the
diocese
which
is
introduced
here
as
a
matter
that
must
be
discussed,
writes
expressly
that
only
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
which
is
the
same
position
of
the
college
of
cardinals
in
my
church
and
the
catholic
church,
those
two
highest
diocese
authorities
may
only
appoint
bishops,
they
remove
bishops
and
it
may
only
appoint
diocesan
bishops
for
a
particular
diocese
in
the
congregation
or
parishes
where
people
in
that
diocese
have
no
say
with
respect
to
the
appointment
of
those
particular
bishops.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
precisely,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
is
exactly
the
way
we
have
diocesan
bishop.
now,
so
the
basic
law
in
this
case,
i
have
a
little
trouble
arguing
this
case
because
it
seemed
so
simple
to
me
and
i
do
not
want
to
over
simplify
my
argument.
watson
versus
jones,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1871,
the
first
defended
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
this
subject
matter
and
that
court
after
a
very
deep
analysis
of
the
issues
and
the
first
amendment
said
in
substance,
i
have
the
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
you
are
correct
that
watson
did
not
refer
to
the
first
amendment.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
i
said
that,
then
i
am
sorry.
i
meant
to
say
that
watson
v.
jones
set
down
the
principles.
later
on
this
court,
in
the
kreshik
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporated
the
first
amendment
to
make
it
applicable
to
the
state
courts
and
to
the
state
legislators
and
forgive
me
for
that
misstatement
that
was
an
oversight
on
my
part.
civil
courts,
said
this
court
in
watson
v.
jones,
are
limited
to
accepting
the
decision
of
the
highest
adjudicative
authorities
in
a
hierarchical
church
and
may
not
inquire
into
the
decisions
made
by
those
authorities
and
once
made,
they
must
be
accepted
by
the
civil
courts
in
gonzales
which
came
along
at
a
later
point.
there
was
this
statement
in
the
opinion,
in
affirming
and
adapting
and
reaffirming
watson
v.
jones,
the
court
said
that
this
was
true
except
possibly
was
the
dictum,
if
there
are
elements
of
fraud,
collusion,
or
arbitrariness
involved
in
the
decisions
of
the
highest
body
of
the
church.
this
court
also
said
that
that
had
very
narrow
reach.
there
was
no
occasion
and
the
court
did
not
apply
that
particular
doctrine
or
gloss
upon
watson
v.
jones
in
that
particular
case
nor
has
this
court
done
it
any
other
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
dictum.
it
has
been
repeated,
but
repeated
as
dictum
from
time
to
time
in
the
cases
this
court
has
determined,
always
going
back
in
every
decision
of
this
court
to
watson
v.
jones
as
the
basic
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
i
would
if
your
honor
pleases.
i
would
via
this
opinion,
that
if
there
is
absolute
fraud
and
absolute
collusion,
then
i
would
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
court
had
not
exercised
--
the
church
authority
had
not
exercise
in
any
respect
the
rights
and
privileges
of
decision
on
the
merits
that
it
had.
it
was
engaged
in
a
fraud,
and
therefore,
was
not
functioning
as
a
decision
body.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
court,
in
my
judgment,
if
your
honor
pleases,
would
be
entitled
to
sit
and
hear
whether
there
had
been
fraud
to
the
extent
that
the
church
body
was
not
sitting
and
exercising
its
rights
and
judgments
as
a
church
body.
so,
it
had
not
performed
judicially.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
your
honor
pleases,
my
answer
to
that
is
of
quite
affirmative
no.
i
thought
your
inquiry
with
respect
to
fraud
or
collusion
was
fraud
or
collusion
in
the
decision
body
itself
among
its
members.
that
is,
they
were
not
actually
exercising
their
judicial
function
within
the
rules
of
the
church
itself.
if
there
is
a
fraud
on
the
body
itself
that
in
my
judgment
does
not
afford
the
civil
courts
to
undertake
to
inquire
into
the
matter.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
very
difficult
and
i
think
that
your
honor,
let
us
put
the
figure
on
it,
it
really
never
would
occur
and
that
is
why
i
have
trouble
with
that
fraud,
collusion
and
arbitrariness
exception.
i
certainly
do
not
(inaudible)
in
reading
all
the
cases,
all
the
judgments
of
your
honors
and
comments
in
the
larger
articles,
zalman
(ph)
and
stokes
(ph)
and
the
others,
i
do
not
see
any
possible
way
in
which
that
can
function
in
the
light
of
watson
v.
jones
and
the
court’s
repeated
affirmance
of
the
principles
of
watson
v.
jones.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
have
to
say
on
my
own,
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
not
to
say
that
there
be
some
measure,
possibly
of
relief.
but
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
we
in
america
are
thinking
in
terms
of
our
own
due
process,
our
own
procedures
and
we
are
inclined
to
impose
or
not
necessarily
impose,
but
we
think
in
that
fashion
and
when
we
are
looking
at
allegations,
whereas
we
are
really
not
permitted
to
do
that
under
watson
v.
jones
and
if
--
these
cases
usually
come
up
in
property
cases,
involving
property.
this
case
involves
property
only
in
the
sense
that
the
original
complaint
filed
in
this
case
by
bishop
dionisije
and
his
followers
sought
to
enjoin
those
loyal
to
the
mother
church
from
occupying
the
seat
in
libertyville,
illinois
and
some
other
properties.
this
is
not
a
property
case
in
the
sense
of
title
to
property.
no
one
is
seeking
any
title
or
trying
to
grab
property
as
is
stated
in
the
(inaudible)
fashion
in
the
answering
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
bishop
firmilian,
as
i
recall
the
facts
if
your
honor
pleases.
bishop
firmilian,
now
bishop
firmilian,
he
was
then
a
cleric
not
a
bishop,
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
holy
assembly
or
by
the
holy
synod
which
is
executive
arm
of
the
holy
assembly
as
the
administrator,
pending
disposition
of
the
proceedings
with
respect
to
bishop
dionisije,
he
being
suspended
in
that
particular
time
and
as
alleged
in
that
complaint,
he
had
written
a
letter
to
the
bank,
holding
one
of
the
bank
accounts,
requesting
that
bank
not
honor
checks
drawn
by
bishop
dionisije
and
his
assistants
and
followers.
in
that
sense,
money
was
involved.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
a
form
of
property,
yes.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
sir?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
not
think
they
would
come
in
the
arbitrariness
provision
announced
in
the
gonzalez
case.
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
has
the
authority
as
dose
the
college
of
cardinals
in
the
catholic
faith
to
grant
that
hearing
or
not
as
it
sees
as
fit.
the
due
process
concepts
of,
we
in
this
great
country,
tend
to
make
us
feel
all
that
very
same
arbitrariness.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
precisely
my
position
and
i
believe
that
is
precisely
the
position
this
court
took
in
watson
versus
jones
which
it
has
been
a
great
care
to
affirm
very
affirmatively
every
time
this
issue
has
come
before
this
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
only
if,
with
what,
this
clause
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
civil
court
inquires
into
whether
or
not
the
appropriate
judicial
authority
in
the
tiers
of
hierarchy
interpreted
its
church
laws,
that
those
church
regulations
and
matters
of
that
character.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
if
it
did.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
said
in
watson
v.
jones
and
other
cases
that
your
honors
have
decided
that
they
generally
are
conflicting.
it
is
amazing.
the
canons
conflict,
the
penal
codes
conflict,
various
ecumenicals
are
held
and
they
reach
various
decisions.
let
us
say
the
bishops
just
assemble
and
calling
on
the
spirit
of
the
good
lord,
reached
the
conclusion.
that
the
bishop
dionisije
should
be
discharged,
that
is
it.
they
exercised
in
the
wrong
spiritual
good
faith,
reached
their
decision
in
this
particular
arch
of
church
and
they
have
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
all
the
civil
court
can
do
is
to
look
to
see
if
the
judicial
body,
having
the
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
a
particular
matter
of
organization
or
a
particular
matter
of
jurisdiction
has
exercised
that
judgment.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
as
to
fraud.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice,
the
reason
i
am
thinking
here
is,
there
are
different
judicial
bodies
in
this
church,
but
they
are
in
tiers.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
it
is
only
the
highest
judicial
body
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops,
sometimes
called
the
bishops'
council
are
comparable
to
the
college
of
cardinals.
there
was
not
any
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
alright.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
closest
i
can
get
to
that
is
the
kedroff
case,
involving
the
occupation
of
the
cathedral
in
new
york
city
in
which
there
were
two
contesting
groups.
one
was
for
members
of
the
russian
orthodox
church
in
america,
organized
under
a
new
york
statute
and
the
other
was
the
russian
patriarch
appointed
by
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
of
the
russian
orthodox
church,
so
there
were
two
contestants
as
who
was
the
patriarch.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
was
absolutely
clear
and
this
court
so
held
that
was
absolutely
clear.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that,
but
i
do
not
doubt
from
what
my
reading
of
law
in
this
area
that
other
religious
would
have
started
that
way
as
well.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
oh
no
clearly,
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
not.
civil
courts
must
accept
the
decision
of
the
highest
body
of
that
particular
church
and
thus
not
reviewable.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
way
of
putting
it.
they
might
not
necessarily
have
followed
him
literally.
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
has
the
same
privilege
that
this
court
has.
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
case.
it
is
not
required
to
decide
it
right.
there
are
allowances
for
error
and
their
allowances
for
error
in
the
case
of
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
insofar
as
any
inquiry
of
a
civil
court
is
concerned.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
would
concede
that
the
civil
court
has
a
right
to
look
into
the
case
sufficiently
only
to
see
whether
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
in
this
case,
in
its
recital
and
the
judgment
or
otherwise
considered
and
construed
its
own
rules,
regulations
and
constitutions
and
if
it
construed
them
for
“x”
result,
that
was
inimical
and
hurtful
to
the
bishop
or
the
person
who
is
under
the
trial.
on
the
other
hand,
the
civil
courts
in
the
united
states
cannot
say,
well,
your
decision
as
to
your
construction
of
your
statutes
was
wrong.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
they
could
do
that.
when
you
use
the
word
arbitrary,
are
you
meaning
arbitrary
in
the
american
sense
or
are
you
saying
arbitrary
in
the
sense
here
in
the
serbian
church
sense?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
think
under
watson
v.
jones
and
even
under
gonzalez
that
that
would
be
binding
upon
a
civil
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
give
no
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
the
general
principle.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
suppose
because
that
is
all
we
can
do
i
suppose
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
not
think
he
gave
in.
as
far
as
arbitrariness
is
concerned
in
the
sense
that
we
now
already
consider
arbitrariness,
there
is
no
moment
and
i
think
the
arbitrariness
should
certainly
be
stricken
from
it.
as
to
fraud
and
collusion,
where
there
is
--
where
the
deciding
body
as
i
said
earlier
becomes
so
bribed
or
it
gauges
under
conspiracy
of
some
particular
kind
that
body
is
not
interpreting
its
own
laws.
that
body
is
not
making
a
decision
based
upon
the
church
authorities.
now,
that
is
what
i
think
he
meant
with
respect
to
fraud
in
conclusion.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
no
court,
the
illinois
appellate
court,
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
found
expressly
that
there
was
no
fraud,
collusion
or
arbitrariness.
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
that
in
its
interpretation
of
the
rules,
regulations
and
constitutional
laws
of
the
church
that
in
its
opinion,
by
way
it
interpreted
those
laws,
that
the
holy
assembly
bishops
did
not
follow
those
laws,
and
therefore,
it
did
not
follow
them
as
the
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
am
exactly
saying
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
address
either
fraud
or
collusion.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
there
is
no
issue
of
fraud
or
collusion.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
you
address
it,
if
i
may
suggest
your
honor
only
to
the
extent
that
you
say
that
it
is
not
arbitrary
in
this
case
for
the
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
the
court
said
the
only
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
you
have
to
stay
out
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
so
many
times,
you
have
to
stay
out
of
this
religious
thinking
and
may
i
just
say
one
word
to
my
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
he
may
have
said
that
in
other
case.
i
ask
you,
your
honors
to
direct
your,
you
will
i
know,
direct
your
attention
to
all
the
issues
in
this
case,
but
article
16,
turning
to
the
reorganization
of
the
diocese,
article
16
of
the
constitution
provides
expressly
that
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
may
create
diocese,
it
may
reorganize
dioceses,
it
may
end
dioceses.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
my
position
if
your
honor
pleases
and
i
think
well
supported
by
the
cases
and
especially
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
save
what
little
time
i
have
left.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
thank
you,
if
your
honors
please.
one,
the
american-canadian
diocese
is
still
a
part
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church.
it
is
not
a
separate
diocese.
when
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
reorganized
the
american-canadian
diocese
because
it
was
becoming
so
large
and
so
difficult
to
administer
as
bishop
dionisije
himself
pleaded
to
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops.
instead
of
signing
more
bishops
over,
they
divided
the
diocese
into
three
parts.
the
very
three
parts
of
bishop
dionisije
had
organized
as
an
episcopal
divisions
and
in
doing
so,
in
the
order,
the
final
boundaries
of
the
newly
established
diocese's
revision
of
the
existing
church
constitution
for
this
territory
in
conformity
with
a
newly
created
situation
and
all
other
questions
relative
to
the
clear
ecclesiastical
organization
of
these
dioceses
shall
be
studied
by
the
church
national
convention
here
with
the
bishops
in
charge
and
there
are
motions
submitted
for
final
decision
of
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops.
so
what
these
holy
men
did,
exercising
sound
judgment
that
will
create
three
dioceses
here
to
afford
better
administration.
you
decide
as
stated
in
this
order
exactly
what
the
boundaries
of
those
three
dioceses
will
be.
you
review
the
constitution
of
the
canadian-american
diocese
and
recommend
revisions
of
that
constitution
to
apply
to
all
three
of
the
dioceses.
that
is
what
these
people
in
yugoslavia,
these
holy
men
said,
“you
are
over
in
america.
we
have
trouble
understanding
quite
what
your
laws
are,
but
you
do
it
and
that
is
what
was
done.”
now
secondly,
the
illinois
supreme
court,
the
illinois
appellate
court,
every
trial
court
that
had
considered
this
matter
has
said
that
the
effort
of
mr.
sullivan’s
clients,
mr.
sullivan,
a
distinguished
illinois
lawyer
to
withdraw
the
dioceses
from
the
article
structure
was
invalid
and
that
this
diocese
is
still
there
pending
the
ultimate
disposition.
now,
litigation
pending
for
13
years,
the
ultimate
decision
of
affirming
the
creation
of
the
three
dioceses
as
a
reorganization
administratively.
now
lastly,
this
diocese
never
had
complete
autonomy.
the
constitution
itself
says
for
administrative
purposes
since
the
american-canadian
dioceses
and
half
a
dozen
others
outside
of
yugoslavia
are
mentioned
in
the
article
to
which
mr.
sullivan
refers,
they
have
to
have
special
provisions
because
we
do
not
have,
it
is
not
the
dioceses
that
are
in
yugoslavia
and
we
are
close
to
them,
we
may
administer
them,
we
give
you
a
large
measure
of
administrative
independence,
but
that
constitution
provides
expressly
and
the
constitution
of
the
diocese
provides
expressly
that
all
decisions
of
the
church
councils
here
must
go
to
the
bishop
and
be
approved
by
the
bishop
and
he
in
turn
submit
them
to
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
for
ultimate
approval.
and
all
decisions
with
respect
the
this
diocese
and
its
administration,
if
the
bishop
disagrees,
then
those
decisions
made
by
the
sabors
and
the
councils
do
not
go
into
effect
until
he
agrees
or
until
its
submitted
to
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
and
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
approve.
so
you
have
this
analogous
situation
in
the
moment
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
few
more
words,
the
holy
assembly
of
bishop
being
placed
in
this
position
with
schismatic
seeking
to
withdraw
from
the
church
and
those
holy
men
in
belgrade
are
holding
the
american-canadian
diocese
as
unit,
pending
disposition
to
this
litigation,
commenced
by
the
schismatic
in
the
summer
of
1963
and
they
having
appointed
now
bishop
firmilian
as
the
administrator,
pending
the
disposition
to
this
litigation
with
the
holy
assembly
in
the
hopeful
deference
to
this
court
and
to
all
other
courts
until
it
is
finally
decided.
it
is
a
sort
of
a
morphacy
(ph)
that
the
diocese
is
a
whole
exist
pending
this
litigation.
the
division
of
the
diocese
also
exists
to
bring
eventually
the
council
of
the
diocese
and
then
it
says
council,
it
does
not
say
there
in
that
order
that
you
shall
call
sabors
in
each
of
the
three
dioceses,
you
shall
call
a
council
for
the
whole
diocese,
report
back
to
us
how
you
need
this
constitution
revised
so
that
this
may
all
be
settled
and
you
may
go
on
administering
with
three
bishops
instead
of
one
bishop.
thank
you,
your
honors.
