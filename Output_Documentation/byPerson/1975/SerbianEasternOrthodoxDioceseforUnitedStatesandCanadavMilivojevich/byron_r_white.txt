justice
byron
r.
white
can
the
--
is
the
court
free
to
disregard
church
decisions
about
that
initial
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
only
it
may
create
bishops,
is
it
not
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
you
are
not
part
of
a
hierarchical
church?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
you
are
not
part
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
church,
to
the
extent
that
the
serbian
church
is
hierarchical,
you
are
not
part
of
that
hierarchy
you
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
if
you
present
--
you
assert
that
that
is
your
claim,
we
are
just
not
part
of
that
hierarchy.
now,
let
us
assume
however
that
the
highest
church
court
in
that
hierarchical
church,
which
you
agree
is
hierarchical
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
highest
church
court
addresses
this
very
question
and
decides
that
you
are
part
of
the
hierarchy?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
they
decided
that
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
the
courts
must
as
a
threshold
issue
address
itself
to
and
can
completely
get
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
hierarchical
structure
and
to
what
extent
it
is?
that
is
the
decision
of
the
church
court
on
whether
it
is
hierarchical
or
not
is
not
claimable?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sound
like
it,
is
it
not?
i
just
wonder
to
what
extent
a
civil
court
is
free
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
a
hierarchical
church
that
this
particular
part
of
the
church
is
part
of
the
hierarchy?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
outset
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
that
issue
was
open
to
some
extent
anyway
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
the
jurisdictional
question
per
se
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
is
that
the
issue
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
you
are
part
of
the
hierarchy
or
not
or
are
you
relying
mostly
on
what
you
are
talking
there
at
the
end
of
your
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
was
arbitrary
or
fraudulent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
that
you
were
one
of
the,
let
us
assume
that
this
diocese
was
one
of
those
diocese
within
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
even,
no
matter
how
arbitrary
the
decision
might
have
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
passage
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
opinion
that
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to.
it
says
that
on
appendix
25,
“plaintiffs
argue
and
defendant
bishop
dionisije
does
not
dispute
that
the
serbian
orthodox
church
is
a
hierarchical
and
episcopal
church.
moreover,
the
parties
agree
that
in
cases
involving
hierarchical
churches
is
the
decision
of
the
proper
church
tribunals
on
questions
of
discipline,
and
so
on
are
accepted
as
conclusive.
all
parties
maintain
the
sole
limitation
as
the
narrowest
kind
for
fraud,
collusion,
or
arbitrariness.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
goes
on
and
decides
in
your
favor
within
that
narrow
exception.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
in
you
petition
for
certiorari,
do
you
challenge
that
recitation
that
i
just
read
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
are
accepting
--
we
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
this
diocese
is
part
of
a
hierarchical
church?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
make
--
you
have
not
challenged
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
this
statement
that
i
read
you?
