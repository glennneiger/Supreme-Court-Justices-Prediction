but
what
constant,
if
any,
do
you
give
to
justice
brandeis
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
collusion
or
arbitrariness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
generally,
that
preceded
the
principle
which
you
have
been
insisting
upon
the
decisions
of
the
proper
church,
tribunals
and
matters
purely
ecclesiastical
or
affecting
civil
rights
or
accepted
litigation
before
the
secular
courts
is
conclusive
because
the
parties
of
interest
made
themselves
by
contract
real-like,
that
is
the
general
principle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
introduced
it
with
in
the
absence
of
fraud,
collusion,
or
arbitrariness.
what
content
did
he
mean
by
that
principle,
do
you
suppose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
exactly
that
mr.
justice
stewart
just
suggested,
none?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
like
hull,
mccollum-hull
said
we
had
not
have
any
occasion
to
define
fraud,
collusion,
or
arbitrariness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
we
do
not
have
to
address
that
hearing
either?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
goes
so
far
as
you
just
suggested
that
at
least
arbitrariness
is
meaningless
and
mr.
justice
brandeis'
dictum,
but
certainly
there
is
no
issue
either
of
fraud
or
collusion
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
arbitrariness?
do
we
not
have
to
address
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
do
that,
we
have
to
give
it
a
definition,
do
we
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
get
to
my

the
plaintiffs
argue
and
defendant
does
not
dispute
that
the
serbian
orthodox
church
is
a
hierarchical
and
episcopal
church.
moreover,
the
parties
agree
that
in
cases
involved
in
hierarchical
churches
and
decisions
of
the
proper
church
in
dealing
with
questions
of
discipline
placed
with
ecclesiastical
rule,
no
affecting
civil
rights
are
accepted
as
conclusive
in
this
case
before
these
civil
courts.
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
do
we
not
have
to
take
it
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
goes
on
to
say
all
parties
maintain
at
the
sole
limitation
on
this
rule.
civil
courts
may
entertain
the
narrowest
kind
of
review
that
carries
on
the
decision
of
the
church
generally
it
is
claimed
to
have
resulted
from
fraud,
collusion,
or
arbitrariness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

who
addressed
them
out?
the
trial

the

justice

well
you
(voice

justice
william

you
did

did
you?

oh
did
you,
i
beg
your
pardon?

my

did

this
case
is
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
presents
an
issue
of
church
and
state
in
a
different
context.
in
1963,
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
in
the
holy
synod
of
the
mother
church
of
the
serbian
orthodox
face
has
its
sea
in
belgrade,
yugoslavia,
suspended
and
ultimately
removed
respondent,
the
dionisije,
as
bishop
of
the
american
canadian
diocese
of
that
church
and
appointed
the
bishop
firmilian
as
administrator
of
the
diocese
which
the
mother
church
then
re-organized
into
three
diocese.
in
1964,
the
holy
assembly
the
holy
synod,
they
brought
respondent
as
a
bishop
and
a
cleric
of
the
mother
church.
in
this
civil
action
brought
by
him
and
others
in
illinois
circuit
court,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
held
that
the
proceedings
of
the
mother
church,
respecting
him,
were
procedurally
and
substantively
defective
under
the
internal
regulations
of
the
mother
church
and
were,
therefore,
arbitrary
and
invalid.
and
the
state
supreme
court
also
invalidated
diocesan
reorganization
into
three
dioceses.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
the
actions
of
illinois
supreme
court,
constituted
improper
judicial
interference
with
decisions
of
the
highest
authorities
of
a
hierarchical
church
in
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
we
hold
that
the
inquires
made
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
matters
of
the
ecclesiastical
cognizance
and
quality
and
court's
actions
pursuant
thereto
did
indeed
contravene
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
therefore
reverse.
mr.
justice
white
joining
the
court's
opinion
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined
by
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
dissenting
opinion.
