justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
it
is
dictum?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jenner,
i
take
it
it
is
your
position
that
the
civil
court
may
go
into
a
determination
of
what
is
the
highest
juridical
body
in
the
church?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
this
has
been
held
and
this
is
clear
and
i
think
is
this
not
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewartâ€™s
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jenner,
if
you
are
right
in
that
we
can
go
no
further
than
to
identify
which
is
the
top
decision-maker
for
the
church
and
having
decided
that
and
say
that
is
really
not
at
issue
here
at
any
time,
having
decided
that,
there
is
nothing
then
left
i
would
think
of
the
case
from
your
approach,
except
disagreement
with
the
illinois
supreme
court's
definition,
if
that
is
what
it
was,
of
arbitrariness?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
got
to
the
argument
so
far
that
this
is
not
a
case
involving
an
hierarchical
church?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
living
thought,
i
know.
