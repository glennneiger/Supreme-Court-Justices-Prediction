justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sullivan
would
you
comment
on
the
point
they
make
at
the
end
of
their
reply
brief
that
their
action
really
rested
on
his
conduct
after
may
10,
1963
in
refusing
to
participate
and
so
forth?
is
that
a
sufficient
basis
for
their
action?
do
you
understand
the
point
i
am
saying?
