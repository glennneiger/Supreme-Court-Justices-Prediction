justice
william
h.
rehnquist
watson
is
not
touching
on
the
first
amendment
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
just
said
it
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
were
simply
an
allegation
of
fraud?
would
the
court
be
entitled
to
sit
and
hear
and
decide
whether
or
not
there
has
been
fraud?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
do
you
apply
that
to
a
practical
case?
so
supposing
the
argument
is
that
the
council
of
bishops
was
deceived
because
one
of
the
people
whom
they
have
heard
had
made
a
false
statement
to
it.
now,
is
that
enough
allegation
of
fraud
to
entitle
the
court
to
review
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
ultimately
made
should
be
reviewed
by
the
civil
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
your
client
in
its
original
complaint
had
requested
some
sort
of
an
injunction
against
a
bank
where
there
was
some
money
tied
up?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
a
form
of
property
strictly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
really
boils
down
to
saying
that
your
client,
the
diocese
comes
into
court
and
presents
an
injunction
and
the
circuit
judge
of
lake
county
just
has
to
sign
it,
no
matter
what
sort
of
defense
the
party
might
raise.
if
the
bishop
wants
an
injunction
they
get
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
is
unclear
though
to
the
court?
what
if
there
are
conflicting
decisions
within
the
church,
the
canonical
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
there
is
a
question
under
church
law
as
to
whether
the
council
of
bishops
say
that
traineo
(ph)
convention
had
the
authority
to
do
this.
can
the
civil
court
decide
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
does
it
decide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
it
decide
what
judicial
body
has
that
jurisdiction,
supposing
there
are
two
different
judicial
bodies
in
the
church?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
concede
at
all
in
response
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
that
the
civil
court
has
the
power
to
see
whether
the
bishops
follow
the
rules
of
the
club,
as
he
put
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
bishop’s
court
said
we
know
this
is
what
our
canon
law
requires,
but
we
are
not
going
to
follow
the
canon
law,
we
are
just
going
to
do
something
we
know
is
arbitrary,
but
it
is
up
to
us
and
that
is
what
we
are
going
to
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
when
you
say
that
the
diocese
had
the
choice
of
keeping
its
own
property,
i
suppose
mr.
jenner’s
argument
is
that
whether
or
not
that
was
the
diocese's
own
property,
it
is
something
that
has
to
be
decided
by
the
church
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
contending
that
the
american-canadian
diocese
is
a
separate
juridical
entity,
not
just
a
branch
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
serbian
eastern
orthodox
church
and
council
of
bishops
decide
that
the
lutheran
church
in
america
is
a
part
of
the
hierarchy
of
the
serbian
eastern
orthodox
and
the
serbian
eastern
orthodox
church
goes
to
court
and
says
we
want
to
take
over
the
following
lutheran
churches,
would
a
court
be
entitled
to
inquire
into
that
point?
