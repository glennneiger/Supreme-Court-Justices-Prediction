you
talked
a
bit
about
what
might
happen
if
there
were
fraud.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
were
crystal
clear
under
the
church
law,
the
constitution,
that
the
governing
body
before
it
could
remove
or
defrock
a
bishop
had
to
afford
him
what
we
call
a
due
process
hearing
and
assume
further
that
it
were
equally
clear,
undisputed
that
no
such
hearing
had
been
provided,
would
you
think
that
would
come
under
the
arbitrariness
exception
in
gonzalez?

my
assumption
was
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
church
law
required
a
due
process
hearing,
not
the
united
states
constitution?

along
that
same
line
of
inquiry,
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
do
not
question
the
basic
jurisdiction
of
the
mother
church
in
belgrade
to
remove
the
american
bishop.
you
do
question
and
i
understand
to
be
the
issue
here,
the
way
in
which
it
exercised
that
jurisdiction,
you
said
that
if
it
had
acted
properly,
it
had
the
authority
under
church
law
to
remove
the
american
bishop?
