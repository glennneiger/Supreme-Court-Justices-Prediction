we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
75-292,
the
serbian
eastern
orthodox
diocese
against
milivojevich.
mr.
jenner
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
distinguished
in
any
way
between
fraud
and
collusion
on
one
hand
and
arbitrariness
on
the
other
as
to
the
reach
of
judicial
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
hypothetical.
suppose
the
determination
dismissal,
defrockment
was
for
a
basis
that
would
not
be
tolerated
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
internally
in
all
matters?
let
us
say
for
example
with
the
particular
priest
or
bishop
had
exercised
his
first
amendment
rights
within
the
framework
of
this
country
in
a
way
that
was
unacceptable
to
the
hierarchy
and
they
dismissed
him
on
that
ground,
is
that
reviewable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
judicial
function
is
to
see
whether
the
particular
church
followed
the
rules
of
the
club
when
they
acted.
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
is
a
little
bit
like
the
difference
between
the
corporation
and
the
partnership.
it
is
not
just
something
a
part
of
an
mythology.
it
is
a
world
of
honor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
the
midwest
group
appoint
its
own
bishops?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
bishops
currently?
does
belgrade
appoint
the
bishop?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
have
any
bishops
been
appointed
in
these
three
categories
now,
these
three
geographical
areas
other
than
belgrade
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
is
who
has
been
appointing
the
bishops
lately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
sounds
something
like
hierarchical,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
1963,
has
any
bishop
been
appointed
in
this
diocese?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
again,
i
thought
i
got
this
before,
what
was
the
source
of
this
appointment,
belgrade
or
chicago?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
1963?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
bishop
is
now
holding
office
got
his
authority
out
of
belgrade?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
why
do
you
not
declare
it
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jenner,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
75-292,
serbian
eastern
orthodox
diocese
against
milivojevich
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
