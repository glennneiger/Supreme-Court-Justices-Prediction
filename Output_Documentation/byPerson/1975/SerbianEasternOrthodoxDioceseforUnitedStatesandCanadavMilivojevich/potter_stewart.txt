justice
potter
stewart
that
is
why
this
respondent
diocesan
bishop
became
a
diocesan
bishop,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
really,
truly
under
your
understanding
of
that
exception
to
the
rule,
fraud
or
collusion
or
arbitrariness,
it
is
--
particularly
fraud
or
collusion,
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
case
in
the
real
word,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
would
you
think
that
if
you
could
absolutely
prove
that
the
decision
makers
in
the
church
have
been
bribed
to
reach
the
decision,
they
did
and
reached
it
for
that
reason
that
that
would
come
within
the
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
is
that
the
college
of
cardinals
are
the
equivalent
of
council
of
bishops
here,
could
say,
that
is
very
clear
in
the
language
of
church
law
and
we
decided
in
this
court,
in
a
case
that
that
means
no
hearing
at
all
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
they
would
have
the
exclusive
power
to
decide
what
that
meant
and
by
their
action
they
would
have
decided
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
--
i
gather
my
brother
rehnquistâ€™s
question
is
what
if
two
groups
exist
and
each
one
claims
it
is
the
highest
judicial
body
in
that
particular
church
and
one
defrocks
the
bishop
and
the
other
says,
no
you
will
not
defrock,
instead
of
that
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
medal,
you
have
been
such
a
good
bishop.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
what
does
the
court
then
do?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
rather
pretty
clear
who
the
original
and
legitimate
one
was,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
way
the
episcopalian
church
begin
in
this
country,
did
it
not,
by
a
renegade
bishop
from
the
church
of
england?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event
that
is
you
say
not
an
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
it
was
arbitrary?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
you
are
right
in
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
right,
who
will
appoint
the
successor
of
the
respondent
bishop
here?
justice
potter
stewart
but
without
reference
to
the
assembly
of
bishops
in
belgrade?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
are
saying
--
it
sounds
like
you
are
saying
one
or
two
things.
one,
the
serbian
interest
may
be
hierarchical
church,
but
we
are
not
part
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
may
be
one
of
your
arguments.
the
other
one
apparently
is
that
it
just
is
not
hierarchical?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
to
the
church
i
suppose?
justice
potter
stewart
since
1963,
your
relationship
to
the
church
in
yugoslavia
is
more
or
less
the
same
as
the
episcopal
church
of
the
united
states
as
to
the
church
of
england,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
hierarchical,
but
one
is
not
part
of
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
they
have
the
same
root?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
question
the
validity
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
separate
church
members?
