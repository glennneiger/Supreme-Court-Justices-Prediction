mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
divide
my
opening
remarks
into
three
general
areas.
one,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
division
question.
secondly,
the
hierarchical
question
which
has
been
used
in
this
case
and
then
thirdly,
the
disciplinary
proceedings
against
bishop
dionisije,
briefly,
as
to
all
three
of
them.
first
of
all,
we
see
the
issues
in
this
case
as
far
as
this
diocese
is
concerned
as
a
serbian
corporate
diocese
really
congregational
in
nature
which
established
a
constitutional
relationship
with
the
serbian
orthodox
church
in
belgrade,
yugoslavia
and
if
i
refer
to
the
serbian
eastern
orthodox
church
of
yugoslavia
from
time
to
time
as
belgrade,
i
intend
any
no
more
disrespect
in
that
regard
than
when
i
refer
to
my
own
church
as
well.
so
if
i
inadvertently
use
that
term,
please
i
am
not,
your
honors,
intending
any
disrespect.
under
the
terms
of
the
relationship
which
existed
between
the
american
canadian
diocese
and
the
belgrade
church,
the
belgrade
church
was
provided
the
spiritual
leader.
the
american,
canadian
diocese,
however,
was
as
to
its
administrative,
legislative
and
property
was
and
according
from
the
constitution
which
is
approved
by
the
belgrade
church,
have
full
administrative
freedom
was
to
independently
rule
and
regulate.
now,
i
quote
from
what
the
belgrade
church
when
it
approved
that
constitution,
we
hope
that
you
have
“complete
autonomous
administrative
freedom.”
it
is
the
only
diocese
in
the
serbian
orthodox
church
which
owns
its
property
free
and
clear
of
any
interest
by
the
serbian
orthodox
church.
its
congregations,
each
have
a
constitution
and
the
diocese
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
the
property
of
the
congregations.
the
american-canadian
diocese
controlled
itself
by
means
of
a
church
national
assembly,
composed
of
some
of
the
clergyman
and
representatives
in
the
various
congregations
which
they
have
from
time
to
time
called
it
sabor
(ph),
and
it
and
only
alone
could
amend
the
constitution.
it
is
found
in
the
serbian
church
constitution,
not
in
article
14,
which
says
these
are
the
diocese
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church
and
then
lists
all
the
dioceses
in
yugoslavia,
but
it
is
in
found
in
article
15
(a)
or
it
was
found,
it
has
not
been
found
since
may
10,
1963,
but
prior
to
that
date,
article
15
of
the
serbian
church
constitution
said,
in
addition
to
those
dioceses
in
a
hierarchical
respect
is,
sub
paragraph
8,
the
american
canadian
dioceses
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
canada.
in
1963,
the
belgrade
church,
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops,
acting
within
its
authority
removed,
the
american,
amended
article
15
(a)
and
since
then
the
american
canadian
dioceses
has
never
appeared
in
this
constitution.
in
its
place
it
put
three
new
dioceses
that
were
west,
midwest,
and
eastern.
it
also
at
the
same
time,
in
effect,
attempted
to
distribute
the
property
of
the
three
dioceses
and
place
three
spiritual
leaders.
what
was
the
dioceses
to
do?
two
alternatives;
they
could
go
along
with
it
or
they
could
insist
upon
maintaining
their
own
existence,
their
own
integrity
and
their
own
property.
they
chose
the
latter.
the
representations
have
been
made.
there
are
no
assets
concerned
here.
there
are
three
large
pieces
of
real
estate,
one
which
is,
just
as
there
are
incidentally
three
new
dioceses,
one
lying
in
the
east
in
pennsylvania,
called
shadeland
and
i
cannot
recall
how
many
acres,
but
it
has
become
a
cultural
center
who
serves
in
that
area
as
an
old
folks
home.
the
real
estate
in
libertyville,
illinois
in
lake
county
which
has
a
cemetery,
the
king
peter
lies
there,
it
has
been
there,
it
under
the
reorganized
plan
is
to
become
the
home
of
the
midwest
diocese
and
thirdly,
there
is
a
piece
of
substantial
real
estate
in
california
owned
by
the
diocese
which
they
have
accumulated
over
the
years.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir,
the
constitution
of
the
american-canadian
diocese
makes
it
quite
explicit
and
quite
clear
that
the
diocese
owns,
i
may
not
be
able
to
quote
it
accurately,
owns
its
own
property
and
it
is
without
rights
of
anyone
else
in
it
and
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
in
the
sense
of
having
its
own
existence,
in
the
sense
of
autonomously
regulating
itself,
in
the
sense
of
having
its
own
church
national
sabor,
in
the
sense
that
really
it
existed
when
it
had
--
as
found
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
i
do
disagree
with
all
of
it
sir,
but
i
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
well,
let
me
address
myself
to
the
hierarchical
aspects.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
in
agreement
with
that
completely
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
okay.
let
me
address
to
the
hierarchical
distinction
mr.
justice
in
that
and
really
it
is
in
rebuttable
to
what
mr.
jenner
has
said.
now
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
oh!
who
was
it
mr.
justice
holmes
who
said
a
word
is
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
(voice
overlap)
living
right.
alright,
we
do
not
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
well,
it
is
a
world
of
theology
and
it
is
from
a
different
discipline
than
ours
and
our
discipline
is
jurisprudence.
now,
we
have
learned
clergyman
describe
what
hierarchical
meant
and
we
cited
part
of
it
in
our
record
and
what
they
said
was,
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
ascendancy
of
a
bishop,
priest,
and
deacon.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
it
could
not
before
may
10,
1963
when
then,
prior
to
the
date
that
they
attempted
to
divide
this.
prior
to
the
date
that
they
took
us
out
of
there
constitution,
it
had
agreed
with
belgrade
that
belgrade
would
appoint
its
spiritual
leader,
that
is
to
say
its
bishop.
but
once
they
took
us
out
of
their
constitution
in
a
perfect
way
to
amend
this
out,
we
could
not
amend
ourselves
up
because
they
had
to
approve
any
amendments
of
our
constitution,
but
they
lacked
the
ability
to
amend
our
constitution.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
to
the
american
canadian
diocese?
belgrade
does
not
because
the
american-canadian
diocese
does
not
exist
in
the
belgrade
constitution.
it
has
been
removed
since
may
of
1963.
they
have
three
difference
dioceses
there.
they
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
that
will
be
up
to
the
members
of
the
church
national
assembly
or
sabors.
those
members
of
the
illinois
religious
corporation
which
are
the
congregations
that
supported
when
they
meet
in
their
every
three
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
i
think
they
could
choose,
if
they
want
it,
they
could
choose
a
serbian
bishop.
i
think
it
is
up
to
them
to
decide
who
they
will
look
to
now
for
spiritual
leadership
because
their
administrative
leadership
and
their
property
and
their
legislative
authority
has
always
been
intent
and
they
had
it
in
a
smaller
form
when
they
look
to
the
russian
orthodox
bishop
for
guidance
prior
to
1921.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
in
the
three
new
dioceses,
your
honor?
no
sir,
those
are
three
new
dioceses
which
belgrade
has
a
perfect
legal
right
to
have,
but
they
certainly
are
not
successors
to
the
american-canadian
diocese.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
to
the
three
diocese
represented
by
mr.
jenner,
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
of
belgrade,
yugoslavia.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
in
the
religious
sense,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
religious
sense
is
defined
by
the
religious
men
that
they
are
hierarchical
because
they
all
say
hierarchical
refers
to
the
flow
of
sanctifying
grace
from
bishop
to
priest
to
layman,
but
what
i
think
is
causing
some
confusion
in
the
case,
now
mr.
jenner
compared
to
roman
catholic
church
and
i
am
quite
familiar
with
that
and
they
make
us
sort
of
file
in
here.
this
diocese
has
never
been
like
the
roman
catholic
church
diocese
where
the
real
estate
is
owned
by
the
catholic
bishop
of
chicago
and
he
absolutely
has
an
obligation
to
respond
to
rome.
this
is
the
most
unique
diocese
in
the
serbian
orthodox
church
and
to
say
that
this
is
wholly
and
flatly
hierarchical
is
to
ignore
the
clear
provisions
of
the
constitution
in
the
practices
over
the
years.
how
do
you
explain
that
it
is
no
longer
--
that
they
were
never
found
in
article
14
of
their
constitution?
the
relationship
has
always
been
one
of
independence
over
here
in
america
as
far
as
administration
and
control
of
the
property
is
concerned
and
we
look
to
belgrade
after
the
russians
finally
found
this
too
cumbersome
to
carry
far
the
appointment
of
the
bishop.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
article
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir,
i
hope
i
am
not
misleading
you.
without
any
doubt,
those
dioceses
in
the
serbian
orthodox
church
found
in
article
14
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church
are
hierarchical
and
are
strictly
hierarchical
and
are
as
hierarchical
as
the
amicus
here,
the
catholic
archbishop
of
chicago.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir,
we
are
not.
we
are
in
fifteen.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
today?
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
but
we
have
our
church,
whatever
church
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
since
they
threw
out
us
out,
since
they
amended
us
out,
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
i
am
not
too
sure
of
that
relationship,
but
it
is
one
of
respect.
it
sounds
close.
they
threw
us
out.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
there
is
no
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
i
agree.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
i
do
not
believe
they
have
ever,
unless
it
is
quite
that
in
that
manner.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
let
us
assume
that
they
have
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
i
do
not
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
church
court
as
far
as
it
affects
property
rights
need
be
enforced
by
a
civil
court
of
this
country
as
long
as
the
civil
court
of
this
country
can
pick
up
the
constitutions
that
regulate
the
relationship
between
the
two
parties
and
make
the
decision
without
finding
themselves
in
a
doctrinal
snare.
if
you
can
find
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
mr.
justice,
i
hope
it
does.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
well,
i
think
it
must
be
able
to
ask
the
person
who
comes
looking
to
a
civil
court
for
enforcement.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
well
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
i
think
anyone
making
application
to
a
court
for
civil
court
enforcement
of
a
decision
must
one;
demonstrate
that
we
have
jurisdiction
and
they
must
be
able
to
demonstrate
it.
they
are
going
to
get
civil
court
enforcement
by
neutral
principles
of
law
and
you
said
that
in
the
hull,
the
states
better
set
it
up
that
way
and
the
churches
better
get
it
together
that
way.
i
think
then
they
would
have
to
demonstrate
it
is
a
matter
over
which
we
have
jurisdiction
and
then
they
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
good
basis
for
their
opinion.
whereupon
i
think
the
defense
--
let
us
say
they
make
the
prima
facie
and
there
may
be
some
other
elements
that
they
have
to
prove,
then
i
think
the
defense
is
available
for
someone
to
come
in
and
say
that
decision
is
absolutely
fraudulent,
that
that
position
was
obtained
by
the
collusion
of
three
ex-lutheran
members.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
i
am
not
too
sure.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
the
hierarchical
aspects,
we
are
called
the
hierarchal
blanket
drawn
over
the
issues
by
the
petitioners.
i
believe
we
--
our
diocese
is
not
the
strictly
roman
catholic
hierarchical
diocese
so
that
the
class
3
watson
and
jones
or
paragraph
3
of
watson
and
jones
hierarchical
rule
does
not
apply
to
our
diocese
because
there
are
in
existence
clear,
easily
read
constitutions
which
involved
no
doctrinal
disputes
by
which
this
question
can
be
resolved.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
article
14
inside
yugoslavia?
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
if
they
sought
civil
court
enforcement
of
it
and
we
thought
we
could
put
up
a
defense
of
fraud,
collusion,
or
arbitrariness,
yes
sir,
then
we
would
be
here.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
but
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
right
of
the
holy
assembly
in
that
case
because
there
is
not
another
diocese
in
the
serbian
orthodox
church,
it
has
a
constitution.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir?
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
the
american
canadian
diocese?
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no,
libertyville.
they
have
a
vicar
bishop
in
addition
to
bishop
dionisije
who
was
elected,
i
should
say
nominated
by
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops.
he
was
consecrated
in
the
usual
orthodox
manner
by
laying
on
of
hands
of
orthodox
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir,
now
you
are
talking
about
the
american-canadian
diocese.
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
maybe
i
have
confused
it.
the
american-canadian
dioceses
of
libertyville
which
we
represent
and
the
congregations
which
have
remained
faithful
to
libertyville
and
recognized
bishop
dionisije
as
a
bishop,
these
are
the
ones
i
am
talking
about,
they
elected
a
vicar
bishop
who
serves
under
bishop
dionisije
in,
i
think
it
was
1963
or
1964,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
year,
they
nominated
him
really
and
then
he
was
ordained
by
other
orthodox
bishops
which
as
far
as
their
concern
makes
ecumenical,
takes
a
laying
of
hand
of
two
orthodox
bishops
to
make
him
an
orthodox
bishop.
now,
he
serves
as
vicar
bishop
under
bishop
dionisije
in
the
american-canadian
dioceses.
now,
as
to
the
three
new
dioceses,
those
bishops
have
been
appointed
by
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops,
actually
four
because
one
passed
away
and
they
have
not
filled
in
the
spot,
so
they
made
four
appointments
of
bishop
to
their
three
dioceses
in
america.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir.
they
have
certain
right
to
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
we
cannot
--
you
see
when
you
talk
about
the
american-canadian
bishop
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church,
if
we
pick
up
their
constitution
we
cannot
find
it
in
the
constitution
because
they
wrote
out
us
out
and
they
had
an
absolute
right
to
write
us
out
and
one
of
our
complaints
about
justice,
the
illinios
supreme
court’s
opinion
was
they
got
down
to
the
end
of
opinion,
they
said
yes,
these
people
had
used
the
word
repudiation
because
all
of
the
sudden
we
are
talking
contract
law,
but
these
parties
have
split
apart,
but
i
find
that
there
is
an
underlying
religious
unanimity
that
exists,
and
therefore,
i
am
not
going
to
give
the
natural
effect
to
their
acts
that
i
would
if
the
were
voluntary
association,
a
club
or
a
union
and
we
feel
--

mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
we
felt
all
issues
necessary
do
justice
are
before
the
court.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
we
filed.
it
was
known
as
a
conditional
cross-petition.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
and
an
issue
arose
because
we
came
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
i
do
not
know
it
was
allowed.
it
was
not
specifically
allowed
mr.
justice.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir,
it
was
not
denied
either.
all
they
said
was
certiorari
granted
and
we
felt
all
issues
necessary.
we
wonder
whether
or
not
that
one
will
make
a
footnote
on
federal
practice
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
we
did
raise
that
issue.
we
felt
that
the
court
went
as
far
as
it
did.
now,
i
would
like
to
move
to
bishop
dionisije
briefly.
bishop
dionisije,
a
member
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church
elevated
to
bishop.
in
1961,
they
adapted
a
penal
code,
penal
procedures.
as
an
incident,
in
our
view,
to
their
efforts
to
--
no
matter
what
their
motives
were,
to
proceed
against
bishop
dionisije,
they
sought
first
of
all
to
suspend
him,
take
the
first
step
in
the
penal
proceedings,
then
the
second
step
they
appointed
an
administrator
who
was
just
to
keep
the
place
from
burning
down
while
they
proceeded
with
the
penal
proceedings.
practically,
there
was
a
great
stir
in
the
country
among
the
people
because
of
the
division
of
the
dioceses
and
the
sabor
i
think
was
(inaudible)
in
council
fired
off
telegrams
to
belgrade
and
said,
“look,
give
bishop
dionisije
a
trial.
if
he
is
guilty,
he
is
guilty.
if
he
is
innocent,
he
is
innocent.
let
us
take
care
of
that
issue.”
but
as
far
as
this
division
question
is
concerned
we
are
going
to
move
this
sabor
forward
and
we
want
to
find
out,
we
are
going
to
present
this
to
the
congregations
who
are
still
with
us
and
by
the
way,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
congregations
can
come
and
congregatons
can
go.
we
have
no
interest
in
their
property.
there
is
anything
much
we
can
do
about
it.
we
feel
belgrade
acted
with
a
great
deal
of
haste.
a
great
many
charges
and
accusations
were
thrown
back
and
forth,
heresy,
heretic,
systematic
and
were
thrown
by
both
sides,
a
great
deal
of
mud,
back
and
forth.
investigating
commission
whose
obligation
it
was
to
come
over
and
follow
the
rules
of
penal
procedure
completely
and
totally
ignored
the
rules.
they
would
not
show
him
the
charges.
they
have
issued
findings
of
his
guilt
and
as
soon
as
they
talked
with
him,
they
knew
very
well
what
the
outcome,
the
result
would
be.
the
sum
in
substance
of
it
was
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes,
i
understand
the
point.
i
have
two
answers
to
that
and
perhaps
the
most
important
answer
is,
earlier
in
the
brief
they
say,
“aha!
the
court
gave
this
case
a
trial
de
novo.
they
could
not
do
that.
the
bishop
dionisije’s
faction
retried
his
guilt
or
innocence
before
the
court
and
then
immediately
in
their
brief
they
come
back
and
say,
but
notwithstanding
that,
there
was
still
plenty
to
convict
him
on.”
but
let
me
answer
the
second
part
of
that
question.
his
conduct
after
made
attempt,
when
he
failed
to
recognize
the
division,
since
every
court
has
held
that
the
division
was
illegal,
i
would
find
it
rather
unconscionable
to
support
a
judgment
against
him
because
he
was
right.
i
know
it
makes
a
tough
situation.
had
they
followed
the
rules,
and
strictly
adhered
to
the
rules,
i
think
their
judgment
would
be
entitled
to
enforcement
by
this
court.
but
as
it
stands
now
since
they
did
not
follow
the
rules,
i
think
this
court
has
to
say,
i
am
sorry
we
are
not
going
to
enforce
it.
now,
you
are
not
reinstating
him
as
a
bishop
because
there
is
no
desk
in
the
holy
assembly
of
bishops
meeting
the
hall
for
the
serbian,
for
the
bishop
of
the
american-canadian
diocese.
it
is
gone.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir,
in
the
context
by
which
i
have
attempted
to
explain
it
that
they
looked
to
belgrade
for
the
spiritual
leadership,
but
thy
have
always
had
it
--
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
no
sir,
we
have
not.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
absolutely,
subject
to
the
problem
and
really
we
have
the
bishop
dionisije
issue
here
and
no
matter
what
the
court
sees
fit
to
do
on
the
bishop
dionisije
issue,
the
integrity
and
the
fact
that
we
have
been
thrown
out
of
the
serbian
orthodox
church
still
remains
and
whether
this
--
a
civil
court
sees
fit
to
enforce
that
decision
of
belgrade
regarding
disciplinary
proceedings
against
bishop
dionisije
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
illinois
religious
corporation
still
exists
and
it
may
now
have
to
look
to
somebody
else
for
spiritual
direction.
now,
it
has
already
been
recognized
by
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
who
is
known
as
the
judge
of
the
patriarch
of
the
orthodox
church,
it
is
also
recognized
by
other
orthodox
clergy
and
this
may
be
evolutionary
sort
of
thing.
mr.
leo
j.
sullivan,
iii
and
that
by
the
way
i
warn
you
it
is
not
in
the
record.
that
is
something
just
occurred
within
the
last
six
weeks
or
so,
the
recognition
by
the
patriarch
of
alexandria.
would
that
be
all
mr.
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
you?
thank
you.
