but
that
is
even
assuming
the
court
of
appeals
was
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
argue
generally
as
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
rely
on
babcock?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about,
mr.
cohen,
if
you
--
let
me
begin
my
question
by
saying
this.
all
part
of
this
problem,
all
logan
valley
and
lloyd
against
tanner
all
stems
back
to
the
marsh
against
alabama.
justice
potter
stewart
the
old
fashioned
kind
of
company
town.
what
if
you
had
a
company
town
here,
a
marsh
against
alabama,
would
you
still
think
nothing
--
this
is
not
a
constitutional
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
company
town
and
the
company
was
the
employer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
like
marsh
against
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
still
be
no
more
than
a
statutory
case,
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
have
a
pure
company
town
situation
then
the
hypothesis
is
that
the
company
is
the
equivalent
of
government?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
theoretical
underpinning
of
marsh
against
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
more
room
for
alternatives,
is
there?
there
might
be
room
for
time
and
place
regulation,
but
beyond
that
there
is
not
any
room
for
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
it
even
involve
labor
dispute?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it
did.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
tanner
that
did
not
involve
labor
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
a
part
victory
for
you.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
two
factors
as
i
understand
it.
first
of
all,
two
factors
that
distinguish
this
from
babcock
&
wilcox,
first,
that
this
was
quasi
public
property.
justice
potter
stewart
and
secondly,
that
this
was
not
an
organizational
picketing,
but
rather
consumer
picketing?
justice
potter
stewart
by
employees.
those
two
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
distinguishes
this
case
from
babcock
&
wilcox?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
be
a
fair
question
to
ask
you
that
is
it
the
board’s
position,
is
it
your
position
on
behalf
of
the
board
that
babcock
&
wilcox
applies
only
to
organizational
picketing
if
you
had
an
employer
such
as
was
involved
in
that
case
without
--
whose
property
was
private
property,
but
the
picketing
was
of
the
nature
that
we
find
in
this
case,
would
the
board
say
that
was
a
different
case
from
babcock
&
wilcox?
justice
potter
stewart
you
understand
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
assume
the
property
were
the
same
as
in
babcock
&
wilcox.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
picketing
was
as
in
this
case,
then
what
rule
would
the
board
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
law
on
the
board
which
really
means,
if
you
parse
it
down,
that
your
second
factor
is
not
a
distinguishing
factor,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
in
the
light
of
the
present
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
constitution,
does
it
not,
that
gets
you
anywhere
except
against
governmental
action?
justice
potter
stewart
until
and
unless
mr.
hudgens
here
could
be
equated
with
government,
there
are
not
rights
at
all
under
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
nevertheless
mr.
hudgens
can
be
equated
with
a
company
town
in
marsh
against
alabama,
there
is
no
need
to
talk
about
anything
under
the
constitution
because
it
simply
is
inapplicable?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
do
not
understand.
that
is
what
i
did
not,
frankly,
understand
about
tanner
and
of
course,
the
court’s
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
one
really
has
to
start
with
the
constitution
as
the
given?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
that
logan
valley
had
created
some
intermediate
twilight
zone
kind
of
a
situation?
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
joined
the
logan
valley
opinion
if
i
understood
it
that
way.
i
thought
he
equated
it
with
marsh
against
alabama.
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
logan
valley.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
faced
with.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
hudgens
case,
which
is
74-773,
we
have
before
us
a
grant
of
a
write
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
this
case,
a
group
of
labor
union
members
who
engaged
in
peaceful
primary
picketing
within
the
confines
of
a
privately
owned
shopping
center
were
threatened
by
an
agent
of
the
owner
of
the
shopping
center
with
arrest
for
criminal
trespass
if
they
did
not
leave.
the
question
presented
the
basic
issue
is
whether
this
threat
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
national
labor
relations
board
concluded
that
it
did
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
agreed.
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
the
seemingly
important
questions
of
federal
law
involved.
the
rather
lengthy
history
of
this
litigation,
involving
two
trips
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
two
proceedings
in
the
labor
board,
has
been
a
history
of
shifting
positions
on
the
part
of
the
litigants,
the
board,
and
the
court
of
appeals.
it
been
a
history
of
considerable
confusion
in
short,
confusion
engendered
at
least
in
part
by
decisions
of
this
court
that
intervened
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case
the
most
basic
question
is
whether
the
respective
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties
are
to
be
decided
under
the
criteria
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
alone
or
under
a
first
amendment
standard
or
under
some
combination
of
the
two.
for
the
reasons
spelled
out
in
detail
in
the
court’s
written
opinion,
we
hold
that
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
free
expression
has
no
part
to
play
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
is,
involving
picketing
on
private
property.
accordingly,
the
judgment
before
us
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
directions
to
remand
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
so
that
the
case
may
be
there
considered
under
the
statutory
criteria
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
alone.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
statement
concurring
only
in
the
judgment,
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
has
been
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
