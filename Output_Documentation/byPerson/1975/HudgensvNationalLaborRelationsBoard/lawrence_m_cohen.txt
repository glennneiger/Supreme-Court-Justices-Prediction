mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
when
in
a
case
arising
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
do
non-employees
have
the
right
to
picket
on
private
property,
in
this
case,
the
private
property
of
a
modern
shopping
center.
to
resolve
this
question,
four
decisions
of
this
court
must
be
reconciled.
we
have,
first
of
all,
the
babcock
&
wilcox
decision
of
the
court
in
1956
which
was
a
case
arising
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
held
that
non-employees
do
not
have
a
right
to
come
on
private
property
to
engage
in
organizational
activities,
except
where
there
are
no
other
reasonable
alternatives
available.
the
second
case
is
a
constitutional
case,
arising
under
the
first
amendment,
the
logan
valley
case
in
1968.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
a
union
may
picket
on
a
private
property
of
a
shopping
center
where
the
center
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
public
property,
where
the
picketing
is
directly
related
to
the
use
to
which
the
center
is
being
put,
and
where
there
are
no
other
reasonable
alternatives
or
opportunities
for
the
pickets
to
convey
their
message
to
the
intended
audience.
the
third
case
that
has
to
be
reconciled,
two
cases
actually,
they
were
decided
at
the
same
day
in
1972.
first,
the
lloyd
case
which
also
arose
under
the
first
amendment
and
not
the
labor
act
where
the
court
held
that
vietnam
protesters
could
not
enter
upon
the
private
property
of
a
shopping
center
to
handbill
because
the
handbills
were
not
related
to
the
functions
of
the
center,
there
were
other
alternatives
available,
and
the
center
was
not
the
functional
equivalent
of
public
property.
finally,
decided
the
same
day
as
lloyd,
there
was
the
central
hardware
versus
labor
board
case
which
arose
under
the
act
and
not
the
constitution,
as
does
this
case,
in
which
this
court
held
that
non-employees
organizers
on
the
parking
lot
of
a
large
retail
store
were
subject
to
the
babcock
&wilcox
test
that
they
had
no
right
of
entry
unless
there
was
an
absence
of
other
reasonable
alternatives.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
like
babcock,
like
central
hardware
that
arises
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
not
the
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
the
union
representing
the
pickets
involved
filed
a
charge
against
hudgens,
the
owner
of
the
center
and
under
the
labor
act,
any
employer
can
be
subject
to
a
charge.
the
board
found
that
the
employer’s
conduct,
that
hudgens
being
an
employer,
not
necessarily
employer
of
the
pickets,
but
nevertheless
being
an
employer,
had
committed
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
by
excluding
the
pickets
and
that
that
conduct
interfered
with
the
pickets’
right
for
self-organization
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
it
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
the
position
that
the
union
has
taken
in
this
place
would
support
that
reasoning.
the
board’s
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
board
would
take
the
position,
as
i
understand
it
depends
in
the
board’s
mind,
really
on
the
type
of
the
property
that
is
involved.
the
board
says
the
distinguishing
feature
in
this
case
from
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
am
saying
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct
and
if
my
client,
to
use
justice
rehnquist’s
example,
had
a
large
shopping
center,
then
the
board
would
make
the
identical
argument
it
was
making
here
today.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
they
would
take
the
position
that
if
this
were
a
large
shopping
center
quasi
public
property
that
the
pickets
would
have
the
right
to
come
onto
that
property
because
that
would
be
the
best
location,
if
you
will,
where
the
pickets
could
engage
in
their
conduct
and
there
would
be
no
need,
unless
if
there
was
some
other
reasonably
attractive
public
place,
that
if
there
was
a
nearest
quasi
public
place,
the
pickets
would
have
a
right
to
picket
there
even
if
it
was
an
employer
of
some
other
business.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
what
the
board
has
done
here.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
the
board
--
let
me
try.
excuse
me.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
as
i
understand
the
board’s
argument,
it
turns
on
what
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
what
type
of
property
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct
and
the
board
says
that
the
difference
between
the
central
hardware
case
and
this
case
is
the
type
of
property
that
is
involved.
if
you
have
what
the
board
says
is
quasi
public
property,
property
that
is
a
functional
equivalent
of
municipal
property,
and
they
would
put
any
large
shopping
center
in
that
category,
that
according
to
the
board,
you
do
not
have
a
section
7
case,
you
have
a
constitutional
case
and
if
you
have
a
constitutional
case,
you
first
look
to
whether
there
is
a
direct
relationship
involved
and,
second,
you
look
to
whether
there
is
some
public
site
available.
if
there
is
no
public
site
available
and
there
is
a
direct
relationship,
then
the
pickets
have
the
right
to
come
onto
the
property.
the
case
turns,
in
other
words,
on
whether
you
have
a
large
shopping
center
such
as
we
have
here
where
you
have
a
small
shopping
center
as
the
board
have
in
the
nickels
case
or
a
large
single-standing
store
such
as
central
hardware,
in
those
cases,
the
board
says
you
do
not
have
quasi
public
property
and
there
is
no
right
to
come
on
unless
you
can
meet
the
babcock
&
wilcox
burden
which
is
essentially
our
position.
the
union
takes
an
opposite
point.
the
union
says
“we
agree
with
you.
it
is
not
a
question
here
of
whether
you
have
a
large
center
or
a
small
center
and
in
any
case,
the
constitution
does
not
apply.”
that
is
so
far,
we
and
the
union
are
in
agreement.
where
the
union
parts
company
is
that
babcock
only
applies
to
organizational
cases,
central
hardware
only
applies
to
organizational
cases.
we
are
picketing.
the
pickets
have
an
absolute
right
to
come
on
as
long
as
they
have
engaged
in
peaceful
primary
picketing.
that
is
the
union’s
position.
let
me,
perhaps
--
excuse
me.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
where
ever
they
picket
as
long
as
they
are
in
primary
picketing,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
on
whose
ever
property
it
is.
there
is
an
absolute
right
according
to
the
union,
as
i
read
their
brief,
to
always
engage
in
peaceful
primary
picketing
even
if
it
is
on
private
property.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
they
cite
for
that
the
steel-workers
case
which
involves
section
8
(b)
(4)
question
of
whether
where
a
union
was
picketing
on
a
private
property
of
a
railroad
company
that
appealed
to
the
railroad’s
employees,
that
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
as
a
secondary
boycott
and
this
court
held
it
was
not
a
secondary
boycott.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
was
a
common
site,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
let
me
briefly
cite
the
facts
in
this
case,
to
put
it
in
some
perspective
of
these
arguments
i
have
been
discussing.
the
facts
are
generally
not
in
dispute.
scott
hudgens
owns
and
operates
what
is
called
the
north
dekalb
shopping
center.
it
is
located
in
suburban
residential
area
of
atlanta.
it
is
a
modern
shopping
center.
it
resembles
very
much
the
center
that
this
court
discussed
in
the
tanner
case.
entry
is
from
five
different
entrances.
three
are
side
streets,
primarily
residential
streets.
full
stop
was
required
before
entering
the
center.
two
others
off
of
a
highway,
shortly
after
a
stop
light.
they
require
a
slow
turn
into
the
center.
at
each
entrance
there
is
a
public
right
of
way
and
there
is
undisputed
testimony
in
the
record
that
pickets
could
have
picketed
on
it
right
away,
safely
and
with
their
picket
signs
legible
to
anyone
passing
by.
after
you
go
into
the
center,
it
is
at
page
141
of
the
appendix,
you
cross
a
large
parking
lot
and
then
reach
an
enclosed
mall
building.
there
is
a
10-foot
wide
sidewalk
surrounding
the
mall
building
and
four
entrances
into
the
main
mall
building
from
the
sidewalk.
85-90%
of
the
customers
of
the
tenant
stores
use
one
of
those
four
entrances.
there
are
also
some
small
entrances
into
individual
stores.
a
considerable
investment
has
been
made
in
the
mall
to
make
it
attractive
to
shoppers,
the
mall
building.
it
is
carpeted.
there
is
piped
in
music,
benches,
fountains,
drinking
fountains,
temperature
controls,
and
carousel
for
children.
the
center
has
pet
regulations,
dress
regulations,
parking
regulations,
security
regulations
which
it
enforces.
the
center
is
closed
at
certain
times
of
the
day
to
anybody
coming
through.
there
is
also
a
long-established
and
uniformly
enforced
policy
that
no
one
has
disputed
here,
of
forbidding
any
commercial
activity
on
the
mall
except
at
least
mall
booth's
kiosk
which
are
at
leased
out
and
handled
like
any
other
tenant
store.
in
fact,
the
center
here
involved
was
before
this
court
in
a
case
in
1974
called
steffel
v.
thompson
which
involve
the
center’s
exclusion
of
vietnam
war
protesters.
it
came
up
in
a
procedural
question
rather
on
the
merits,
but
that
was
the
identical
center
and
the
identical
policy
we
have
here
today.
the
present
controversy
arose
when
employees
of
one
of
a
warehouse
owned
by
one
of
the
tenants
of
the
center,
butler
shoe
co.,
went
on
strike
in
january
1971.
the
tenants
were
not
--
the
pickets
who
then
resulted
from
that
strike.
the
picketing
occurred
on
all
the
nine
butler
locations
in
the
atlantic
area,
including
the
one
at
the
center
and
at
the
warehouse.
pickets
were
not
employed
by
butler
in
the
center.
they
never
sold
shoes.
they
had
no
contact
with
anyone
in
the
center.
their
only
contact
with
butler
was
the
fact
they
were
employed
by
butler
at
another
location
in
atlanta.
there
was
no
dispute
involving
the
center.
the
center
employees
were
unorganized
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
organize
them
here.
the
manager
of
the
shopping
center
saw
the
pickets
waiting
to
picket
at
the
butler
store
inside
the
center
sitting
on
one
of
the
benches.
before
the
butler
store
opened,
he
told
them
they
had
to
leave.
they
left.
they
came
back
a
half
hour
later,
picketed
for
about
30
minutes
with
a
sign
saying
“butler
warehouse
was
on
strike.”
they
marched
up
and
down
in
a
corner
store
where
the
butler
was
located.
sometimes
they
were
four
abreast,
sometimes
only
two
abreast.
after
about
half
an
hour
went
by,
the
manager
saw
them.
he
went
up
to
them,
told
them
to
leave,
and
said
if
they
did
not
leave
they
would
be
arrested
on
the
georgia
criminal
trespass
law.
the
pickets
left.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
approximately
500-feet
from
the
mall
building
and
then
the
pickets
were
inside
approximately
15-feet
from
the
entrance.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
if
the
picketing
were
put
out
in
the
right
of
way,
yes,
they
would
have
been
500
feet
away.
the
customers
would
have
seen
them
as
they
entered
the
shopping
center.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well
certainly,
in
the
union’s
opinion,
that
is
correct,
yes.
the
union
will
say
it
was
diluted
because
of
the
distance
involved.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
would
not.
the
board
found
a
violation
here.
after
the
case
then
went
to
the
fifth
circuit.
there
was
a
remand
as
a
result
of
central
hardware
and
lloyd.
the
board
heard
the
case
again,
found
another
violation,
but
on
a
different
theory
all
together
which
i
will
discuss
and
then
the
case
was
in
turn
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
which
enforced
the
board’s
order,
but
on
a
third
theory
all
together.
so
let
me
turn,
if
i
could,
to
the
different
theories
that
have
been
advanced
to
this
court,
there
are
four
or
five
of
them,
and
try
and
explain
where
i
think
the
parties
differ.
first,
there
are
the
positions
of
the
board
in
its
initial
decision
and
which
is
really
advocated
here
today,
and
that
is
the
constitutional
test.
what
the
board
says
is
that
where
you
have
a
large
shopping
center,
quasi
public
property,
then
central
hardware
and
babcock
are
irrelevant.
that
those
cases
only
apply
when
you
have
a
single-standing
store
or
something
that
is
not
a
functional
equivalent.
and,
where
you
have
a
large
shopping
center,
then
you
apply
a
constitutional
test.
under
the
board’s
constitutional
test,
it
differs
from
the
statutory
test.
the
constitutional
test,
as
the
board
would
apply
it
and
say,
first,
do
you
have
a
direct
relationship
and
they
would
answer
that
by
saying
“yes,
as
the
pickets
at
butler.”
and,
second,
if
you
do
have
a
direct
relationship,
then
the
burden
is
on
the
employer,
not
on
the
union
as
it
would
be
under
babcock,
the
statutory
test,
it
is
on
the
employer
to
show
that
there
is
no
public
place,
not
just
reasonable
alternative
but
public
place,
for
the
union
to
engage
in
its
picket.
if
the
employer
cannot
show
that,
then
the
union
has
the
right
to
picket
on
the
shopping
center,
if
it
is
a
large
quasi
public
piece
of
public
piece
of
property.
second,
there
is
the
approach,
and
this
is
a
different
approach,
of
the
union.
as
i
said,
they
agree
with
us
that
that
constitutional
test
has
no
bearing
here,
but
they
would
say
that
central
hardware
and
babcock
apply
only
to
organizational
situations
that
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
picketing
situation,
a
primary
picketing
situation,
then
the
union
has
an
absolute
right
to
come
onto
private
property,
engage
in
peaceful
primary
picketing.
now,
this
position
has
not
been
accepted
by
the
board.
it
is
rejected
in
both
this
case
and
nickels
case,
and
it
is
also
reject
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
peddie
building
case
which
involved
picketing
on
industrial
park.
there
is
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
really
a
blend
of
these
two
tests
and
was
urged
in
this
court
by
the
amicus
chamber
of
commerce.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
neither
the
statutory
test
nor
the
constitutional
test
provide
the
answer
and
we
need
something
in
between.
so,
they
agreed
except
that
there
ought
to
be
a
test
of
direct
relationship
and
they
agreed
there
ought
to
be
a
test
of
alternatives,
but
it
was
not
clear
whether
they
were
applying
the
test
of
alternatives
that
the
board
proposes
or
the
test
of
alternatives
of
babcock.
in
any
case,
what
they
said
was
alternatives
were
met
here
because
there
was
no
real
alternative
for
picketing
inside
the
mall.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
they
did.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
they
said
“we
are
not
following
the
board’s
argument.”
the
board,
in
fact,
advanced
a
fourth
argument,
a
republic
aviation
employee
test
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
there
is
certainly
an
effective
argument
that
they
should
have
remanded
it
if
they
applied
a
new
test,
and
this
court
said
that
on
occasion,
but
we
have
not
argued
that
here
because
we
think
the
test
of
that
the
court
of
appeals
propose
was
the
wrong
test
too.
so,
we
have
not
argued
that
it
is
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
the
board
has
advanced
a
wrong
test
and
it
is
a
new
test
no
one
has
argued,
none
of
the
parties
have
argued,
the
board,
the
union,
and
us
did
not
argue
it,
it
was
a
proposal
only
by
amicus
that
the
proper
resolution
would
have
been
to
send
it
back
to
the
board
to
apply
that
test,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct,
which
we
do
not
agree
with.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
why
we
are
here
today,
and
that
is
why
we
have
argued
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes.
we
say
the
board
was
wrong,
the
union
was
wrong
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
we
take
a
fourth
position
and
our
position
is
that
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
statutory
case
whether
it
is
picketing
or
organizational
activity
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
already
babcock.
babcock
applies
to
section
7.
where
you
have
a
section
7
case,
it
is
organizational
and
we
got
us
the
type
of
property
involved,
we
think
the
lesson
of
central
hardware
is
you
apply
the
statute.
the
statute
is
babcock
&
wilcox.
you
look
to
whether
there
is
any
reasonable
alternative
to
the
picketing.
if
there
is
not,
as
we
say
there
is
not
here
then
there
is
no
violation
to
the
labor
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
say
if
the
case
arose
under
the
constitution
and
you
had
a
company
town,
then
you
would
have
a
different
result
all
together.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
that
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
see,
then
i
think
what
you
have
is
you
apply
babcock,
but
you
find
no
alternative.
it
is
a
grossingers
(ph)
case.
like
the
grossingers
was
a
resort
hotel.
employees
tried
to
organize
in
the
hotel.
the
second
circuit
got
the
case
and
said
in
that
situation,
the
employees
had
never
left
grossingers.
they
never
had
a
chance
to
go
out
and
see
anybody
else.
they
are
isolated
there.
there
is
no
real
alternative
to
the
union
with
the
coming
onto
the
private
property
to
organize,
and
we
say
the
same
thing
would
be
true
with
picketing.
there
is
no
real
alternative.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
but
the
statutory
test
and
the
constitutional
test
would
yield
the
same
results.
i
say
you
apply
a
statutory
test,
yes,
but
that
statutory
test
and
the
constitutional
test
would
both
determine
in
that
situation
there
is
no
alternative
so
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
picket
or
engage
in
organizational
activity.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
it
is.
let
me
put
it
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
i
said
the
test
is
different,
but
it
would
yield
the
same
results.
now,
the
test
under
the
constitution
asked
for
a
direct
relationship
and
it
imposes
alternatives.
i
say
the
board
is
arguing
that
alternative
test
is
different
from
the
statutory
test.
we
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
that.
we
think
the
test
of
alternatives
under
the
statute
is
not
any
different
than
the
test
of
alternatives
which
is
applied
in
lloyd
and
implied
in
logan
valley.
it
is
not
a
more
stringent
test
as
the
board
proposes,
but
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
question
because,
in
our
view
what
you
are
dealing
with
is
strictly
a
statutory
test
as
long
as
the
union
has
filed
charges
under
the
labor
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
in
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct,
yes,
but
i
am
saying
if
the
union
decides.
it
is
a
question
here.
we
are
not
going
to
proceed
on
the
constitution.
we
are
going
to
file
a
charge
in
the
labor
act.
this
court
said
in
central
hardware,
the
labor
act
may
be
broad
or
may
be
less.
in
that
situation,
a
good
labor
act
gives
you
the
same
protection
except
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
perhaps
because
under
that
situation,
there
is
no
alternative.
you
do
cannot
leave
the
babcock
&
wilcox
test.
so,
you
end
up
with
the
same
result.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
do
not
differ
with
the
board
in
their
proposition
that
an
employer
that
someone
besides
an
employer
of
the
individuals
involved
could
violate
the
law.
i
mean,
there
have
been
cases
that
the
board
has
held
that
say
someone
who
comes
and
pickets,
another
employer
joins
a
picket
line,
he
is
not
employed
by
the
company's
picketing,
that
employer
takes
action
against
him.
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
i
would
not
part
with
the
board
as
far
as
the
employer
involved.
i
think
it
is
a
stronger
case
plus
the
fact
that
you
do
not
have
that
hudgens
is
involved,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
it
turns
out.
i
think
what
it
turns
out,
under
the
statute,
is
whether
there
has
been
an
interference
with
employee
rights.
and,
there
is
not
an
interference
with
employee
rights,
if
the
employees
have
other
alternatives
available,
then
you
look
to
the
employer’s
property
rights.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes.
i
wanted
to
first
cover,
if
i
could,
briefly
why
we
think
the
board’s
position
and
the
union’s
position
are
wrong
and
why
we
think
either
a
test
of
quasi
public
property
or
as
opposed
to
purely
private
property
which
is
the
board’s
approach
or
picketing
as
opposed
to
organizational
rights,
neither
of
those
provide
a
proper
dichotomy
for
resolving
this
dispute.
the
board’s
position,
we
think,
is
wrong
mostly
because
it
would
give
you
an
illogical
situation.
you
have
someone
who
had
a
large
private
store
like
central
hardware,
someone
who
had
a
small
shopping
center
like
the
board
had
in
the
nickels
case,
a
discount
store,
an
industrial
park.
all
those
employers
would
have
one
rule
and
someone
who
is
in
a
large
shopping
center
such
as
lloyd
or
logan
valley,
presumably,
or
the
dekalb
center
here
would
have
a
different
rule,
but
you
have
one
rule
for
large
centers
one
rule
for
small
centers.
now,
that
is
not
what
we
think
the
act
has
intended.
there
is
not
a
demarcation
in
the
act
that
one
type
of
employer
would
be
able
to
insulate
himself
from
the
same
activities
that
the
other
employer
would
be
subjected
to.
that,
if
there
is
anything
to
be
learned
from
lloyd,
it
is
its
size,
openness,
being
clustered
with
other
stores
in
a
modern
shopping
center
do
not
make
the
difference.
it
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
lloyd,
that
the
fact
an
employer
makes
use
of
one
particular
place
for
his
retail
business,
one
situs,
and
be
a
larger
store
than
some
other
store,
that
that
is
not
what
determines
constitutional
rights
and
it
is
not
what
determines
rights
under
the
act.
i
think,
in
addition
to
the
fact,
that,
in
our
view,
central
hardware
did
not
restrict
itself
only
to
certain
types
of
locations.
central
hardware
said
that
the
difference
of
logan
valley
from
central
hardware
was
that
logan
valley
was
not
a
section
7
case
and
logan
valley
was
a
section
7
case
and
that
would
apply
equally
well
to
large
shopping
centers
as
well
as
small.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
logan
valley
was
not
a
section
7
case.
logan
valley
was
a
constitutional
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
it
did.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
it
did.
it
involved
labor
picketing
but
was
not
a
section7.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
this
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
of
course.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
of
course,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
have
not
asked
for
that
because
it
is
really
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
think
you
would
come
up
with
the
same
result.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
i
think
there
is
where
it
erred.
let
me
say
this,
i
think
further
on
the
constitution,
the
board
argues
that
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
then
i
think
you
would
reach
the
result
i
wished.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
let
me
just
make
that
on
the
constitutional
argument
because
this
is
one
of
the
arguments
the
board
advances.
it
said
“look,
you
cannot
have
a
different
test
under
the
constitution
than
you
would
have
on
the
statute.”
therefore,
the
test
that
we
apply
under
the
statute
has
got
to
be
the
same
as
the
constitutional
test,
it
has
got
to
be
the
narrower
test
because
otherwise
you
would
have
conflict.
i
think
the
first
question
you
have
is
can
state
courts
have
any
jurisdiction
at
all
in
this
area?
that
is
a
question
this
court
has
never
answered.
the
state
courts,
you
may
never
have
a
constitutional
case
like
logan
valley
if,
in
fact,
the
state
courts
are
preempted.
that
was
the
point
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
logan
valley
did
not
meet
the
preemption
question
because
it
had
not
been
presented
in
the
court
below.
so,
the
only
justice
who
met
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
who
said
that
he
felt
it
was
preempted.
now,
it
came
up
again
in
the
tanner
case
and,
again,
the
court
did
not
answer
the
question
because
they
found
the
writ
had
been
probably
granted,
although
there
was
a
separate
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
and
a
separate
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
again,
on
the
preemption
question.
now,
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
said
that
they
were
preempted.
they
could
not
give
a
declaratory
judgment
and
that
is
a
question
that
is
before
this
court
on
separate
petition
for
cert
that
has
not
been
ruled
on.
but
there
is
a,
first
of
all,
question
that
we
have
as
to
whether
the
state
courts
are
preempted,
and
even
if
they
are,
whether
you
have
a
conflict.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
he
could
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
why
that
area
may
not
be
preempted
as
you
said
in
(inaudible),
mr.
justice
white,
and
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
tanner
because
it
may
be
a
no-law
area.
so
that
if
you
have
a
conflict
we
would
say
“because
if
you
want
to
avoid
a
no-law
area
that
may
just
be
the
price
to
pay
in
order
to
provide
a
remedy
for
a
wrong.”
let
me
turn,
if
i
could,
quickly
to
the
union’s
argument
and
then
to
why
we
think
the
babcock
test
is
met.
the
right
to
picket,
we
submit,
even
primary
picketing,
even
for
peaceful
purpose
is
not
an
absolute
right.
that
right
has
been
restricted
by
the
act,
restricted
by
state
law
under
certain
circumstances.
the
union
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
engage
in
primary
picketing.
it
has
that
right
only
if
it
meets
other
conflicting
purposes
and
competing
purposes
under
the
act.
the
union’s
argument
that
it
would
have
an
absolute
right
to
appropriate
private
property
to
picket
whenever
it
does
would
also
lead
to
illogical
results.
it
means
the
union
could
come
on
to
private
property
and
picket
to
obtain
recognition,
to
give
you
an
illustration,
but
it
could
not
come
out
to
that
same
private
property
to
sign
up
people
to
an
authorization
cards
to
hold
a
board
election.
so,
what
you
would
have
is
a
case
where
a
union
could
proceed
to
coerce
an
employer
by
recognitional
picketing
as
it
would
have,
under
the
union’s
view,
an
absolute
right
to
do
so,
but
cannot
come
on
to
the
property
to
proceed
or
paint
of
board
election
which
is
the
preferred
course
of
conduct
as
this
court
said
in
lyndon,
as
this
court
said
in
gissel
packing.
taking
that
point
of
view,
which
is
what
we
contend,
then
we
think
the
question
really
is
has
the
union
exhausted
any
other
alternatives
to
communicating
its
message
besides
picketing?
that
that
has
got
to
be
approach,
like
the
babcock
&
wilcox.
well,
those
alternatives
here,
and
there
was
no
evidence
put
on,
the
union
did
not
even
tried
any
alternative?
the
only
evidence
that
was
put
out
by
us
as
to
what
alternatives
that
have
been
used
by
the
shopping
center
to
bring
people
into
the
center
to
conduct
business
with
butler
and
the
other
tenants.
they
consisted
of
newspaper,
radio,
television,
and
all
the
different
techniques
that
the
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
applied
instead
of
alternatives
to
communicating
with
employers.
for
example,
in
central
hardware
when
that
case
was
remanded
back
to
the
board,
one
of
the
things
they
looked
to
had
the
union
tried
--
remand
at
the
court
of
appeals,
was
had
the
union
tried
newspapers?
had
it
tried
radio
and
television?
to
just
appeal
to
those
employees
who
worked
at
the
central
hardware
store.
well,
that
is
an
effective
alternative
to
appeal
to
the
people
working
at
the
central
hardware
store.
it
is
also
an
effective
alternative
to
reaching
the
potential
customers
of
the
department
store.
the
department
store,
in
fact
has
a
larger
audience.
so
if
it
is
effective
to
reach
a
smaller
group,
why
is
it
not
effective
for
reaching
a
larger
group?
no
one
is
ever
answered
that
question.
no
one
is
answering
the
question
of
why
the
union
could
not
have
picketed
on
the
right
of
way
here.
there
was
question
as
to
the
witness
at
page
141
of
the
record,
could
the
union
safely
picket
on
the
right
of
way?
witnesses,
“absolutely.”
could
someone
read
the
picket
sign?
he
said,
“easily,”
never
rebutted
in
the
record,
and
yet
everyone
said
“that
is
just
not
a
correct
place
because
it
is
too
far
away.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
do
not,
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
specter
that
has
been
raised
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
because
i
think
this
is
a
red
herring
in
the
case.
everyone
kept
saying
if
you
picket
at
a
common
place
where
there
are
many
tenants,
you
are
going
to
always
have
secondary
problems.
the
interesting
case
that
just
came
up
was
the
whiter
service
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
but
you
have
more
dry
dock.
you
have
general
building
trade
which
specifically
provide
guidelines
on
how
to
(inaudible)
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
my
client
would
not,
but
many
clients
would
and
i
think
the
illustrative
case
is
the
whiter
service
case,
i
think.
there,
you
had
a
tenant
of
a
large
building.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
but
it
would
not
be
as
disruptive
as
picketing
on
the
enclosed
30-foot
wide
isle.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
would
not
cause,
we
think,
as
much
loss
of
potential
business,
if
you
will.
i
mean,
that
is
really
what
we
are
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
that
may
be.
our
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
disrupts
the
one
store.
it
is
in
an
area
that
is
really
tantamount
almost
to
a
shopping
area.
it
is
almost
an
extension
of
the
store
itself.
there,
it
is
more
disruptive,
we
believe,
than
it
would
be
picketing
on
the
public
right
of
way.
we
cannot
restrict
the
public
right
of
way.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
not
part
of
our
case.
that
has
been
advanced
by
some
of
the
parties.
we
have
not
really
contended
that.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
have
said
that
is
not
really
relevant
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
have
not
argued
that
it
is
connected
because
i
think
that
the
difference
is
whether
it
is
connected
because
it
arose
at
a
different
sites.
the
chamber
as
argued
here
as
an
amicus
in
our
sides
that
it
is
not
connected
because
it
arose
at
a
different
place
than
where
the
pickets
are.
and,
if
you
say
anything
that
is
directed
at
a
customer
at
a
shopping
center,
any
consumer
picketing
on
a
shopping
center
at
a
store
is
related
then
everything
is
related.
no
one
is
even
going
to
picket
for
some
purpose
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
anybody
on
the
shopping
center.
so,
the
directly
related
test
is
a
persiflage,
and
i
think
that
is
correct.
that
is
why
we
have
not
contended
any
direct
relationship
test
because
that
is
not
pertinent
to
a
statutory
situation.
there,
it
is
only
babcock.
babcock
does
not
require
that
it
be
directly
related.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
am
not
arguing
that,
yes.
actually,
that
has
been
argued
in
other
parts.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
argue
the
position
that
the
chamber
adapted
that
if
there
is
a
directly
related
test,
probably
it
may
not
have
been
met
here.
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
argue
with
the
same
vigor
that
they
have
argued
because
i
think
it
is
a
position
that
we
do
not
have
to
really
urge
in
our
situation.
i
think
it
is
very
hard
to
make
it
out
if
it
is
not
directly
related.
i
would
agree
with
you
there.
unless
there
are
some
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
presume
that
is
a
possibility,
but
first
of
all,
it
was
never
tried
here,
we
do
not
know
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
there
was
a
sufficient
public
place
with
the
pickets
to
stand
with
their
picket
signs
that
would
not
have
caused
any
traffic
hazard.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
was
off
the
public
highway.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
why
i
am
saying
i
think
the
record
here
would
not
indicate
that.
i
suppose
the
picket
could
spill
over
into
the
highway
and
there
might
be
a
problem
there.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
radio,
television
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
test
is
not
one
of
expense.
this
is,
i
think,
where
the
board
and
the
union
are
incorrect.
they
say
“it
will
be
expensive
or
it
would
be
less
convenient
or
would
not
be
as
effective.”
the
babcock
test
is
not
whether
you
have
a
most
effective
or
most
convenient
or
the
most
reasonable
place.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
you
have
any
other
reasonable
alternative
and
here
there
were
other
reasonable
alternatives
just
like
there
was
for
communicating
with
the
organizing
purposes
of
the
employees.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
oh,
sure.
if
it
turned
out
that
the
expense
here
was
so
prohibited,
the
union
could
not
possibly
undertake
it.
yes,
that
would
not
be
a
reasonable
alternative,
but
the
testimony
should
be
opposite.
we
put
out
an
expert
witness
in
this
case.
a
man
who
was
well
versed
in
advertising
and
he
said
that
“if
i
had
so
many
dollars
to
spend,
how
much
i
would
pay
for
a
hypothetical
pickets
to
reach
the
nine
stores
in
the
atlanta
area
which
is
being
picketed
that
radio,
television,
mailings,
newspapers,
all
these
were
both
more
effective
and
less
costly.”
so,
the
evidence
here
was
that
it
was
a
reasonable
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
the
board
has
not
addressed
babcock
and
the
only
case,
in
identical
situation,
in
nickels
where
the
board
did
never
put
out
any
evidence.
it
was
a
small
shopping
center.
the
only
difference
is
it
is
a
small
shopping
center.
the
board
argued
logan.
it
got
to
the
trials
that
the
board
of
administrative
law
judge
filed
logan.
it
got
to
the
board.
the
board
said
“well,
that
is
not
logan.
that
is
really
a
babcock
test.”
they
dismissed
the
charge
because
they
said
the
general
counsel
had
not
carry
his
burden
of
proof.
and
the
only
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
was
that
one
was
a
small
shopping
center
and
one
was
a
large
shopping
center.
they
both
picketed.
the
only
difference
between
peddie
building
and
this
case
is
where
the
board
applied
babcock
and
when
the
board
filed
a
babcock
violation,
the
third
circuit
reversed
because
there
was
an
industrial
privacy
to
the
shopping
center,
both
picketing.
so
that
we
would
say
the
result
of
the
third
circuit
reached
in
peddie
and
the
result
the
board
reached
in
nickels
would
be
equally
applicable
here.
you
apply
babcock.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
union
has
attempted
to
exercise
regional
alternatives,
the
charge
ought
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
answer,
i
think,
to
the
question
that
was
asked
to
mr.
gold
is
that
this
court
nor
the
board
nor
the
courts
of
appeals
have
never
held
what
mr.
gold
now
seeks
which
is
the
proposition
that
a
union
has
an
absolute
right
to
picket
at
the
entrance
to
the
struck
plant.
if
the
union
was
engaged
with
secondary
activities
that
congress
cited,
they
could
be
relegated
to
reserve
gate.
there
was
a
contrary
actually
“no
strike”
clause.
they
could
be
relegated
not
to
have
a
right
to
picket
at
the
struck
plant.
i
think
the
cases
that
are
illustrative
and
the
answer
also
to
some
of
the
hypotheticals
asked
to
mr.
come
are
two
board
decisions
which
came
out
after
lloyd,
after
central
hardware,
and
dealt
with
the
precise
type
of
question
we
have
here
in
the
nickels
case
and
in
the
visceglia
(ph)
case.
in
the
nickels
case,
you
have
a
small
shop
with
five
stores.
they
were
contiguous
stores.
there
was
a
parking
lot.
the
union
came
onto
the
parking
lot
of
the
stores
and
picketed
20-feet
away
from
the
entrance
to
one
of
the
five
stores
to
protest
unfair
labor
practices
that
have
been
filed
against
one
of
the
employers.
the
board
in
its
decision
said
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
they
are
cited
in
by
brief,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
nickels
is
the
first
one
as
reported
at
200
nlrb
1130
and
the
board
in
its
decision
said
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
visceglia
dba
peddie
buildings,
and
that
is
reported
at
203
nlrb
27
and
there
has
been
enforcement
denied
by
third
circuit.
they
are
both
cited,
i
believe,
in
our
principle
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
visceglia.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
v.
enforcement
denied,
and
enforcement
was
denied
because,
if
i
could
explain
the
facts
in
the
nickels
case,
the
board
in
applying
the
picketing
situation
involving
a
store
or
a
small
shopping
center
said
that,
as
i
understand
it
in
central
hardware,
this
is
the
administrative
law
judge
in
his
opinion
which
was
adapted
by
the
board,
“the
employer
may
violate
section
81
by
denying
a
union
the
right
to
engage
in
organizational
activities
on
private
property
and
that
encompassed
picketing
here
they
said.
that
result
will
follow
only
if
the
facts
are
shown
and
meet
the
criteria
annunciated
in
babcock
&
wilcox.
as
the
general
counsel
offered
no
evidence
that
would
bring
the
case
within
babcock
&
wilcox
criteria,
it
files
the
complaint
must
be
dismissed.”
in
visceglia,
you
had
an
employer
located
in
a
big
industrial
park.
the
union
came
onto
the
private
roads
of
the
industrial
park.
it
was
an
economic
strike
against
that
employer.
it
picketed
at
the
entrance
to
that
employer’s
plant.
the
board
concluded
it
was
a
babcock
&
wilcox
case.
it
said,
in
so
many
words,
“for
the
reasons
expressed
in
central
hardware,
we
find
the
principles
of
babcock
&
wilcox
rather
than
logan
valley
are
applicable.”
the
board
found
the
babcock
test
had
been
met
for
many
of
the
reasons
that
mr.
gold
had
indicated,
but
the
third
circuit
reversed
that
that
is
not
babcock
&
wilcox.
there
are
other
reasonable
alternatives.
the
board
did
not
consider
them
besides
picketing,
and
therefore,
we
dismissed
the
complaint.
we
found
we
deny
enforcement
because
the
babcock
&
wilcox
test
have
been
met.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
i
think
he
would
disagree
with
both
of
them
because
he
said
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
picket.
the
point
i
want
to
make
in
response
to
mr.
gold
is
that
his
position
has
been
one
that
has
never
been
accepted
by
any
court.
the
steel-workers
case
only
said
that
it
was
not
an
8
(b)
(4)
secondary
boycott
violation.
it
is
all
the
court
says.
we
do
not
even
have
to
consider
whether
there
was
violence
here.
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law
for
other
provisions
of
the
act.
it
is
not
a
matter
for
8
(b)
(4).
so,
the
answer
i
think
is
that
picketing
is
one
means
of
communication.
it
is
not
the
only
means
of
communication.
it
may
be
more
effective
in
the
union’s
mind.
it
may
be
more
persuasive
in
many
ways,
but
it
is
not
under
a
babcock
analysis
which
is
what
the
board
has
been
applying,
what
we
would
apply
in
these
cases.
it
is
not
the
only
answer.
the
only
difference
between
the
nickels
case
and
the
visceglia
case
and
the
cases
at
bar
is
the
fact
that
those
are
smaller
properties.
they
differed
in
size.
they
differed
because
they
were
not
clustered
in
a
shopping
center.
they
differed
in
degree
of
openness.
but
this
court
in
lloyd
made
it
clear
that
is
a
question
of
degree.
it
is
not
a
question
of
principle.
there
is
no
difference
between
those
cases
and
these
cases
on
fundamental
principles
of
law.
and,
i
think
that
is
the
point
we
make
here
today,
that
babcock
must
apply
to
all
types
of
property
cutting
across
the
line
because
it
is
a
section
7
case
that
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
under
lloyd,
that
that
is
a
different
question
all
together
and
when
you
apply
babcock,
you
look
to
the
question
of
all
types
of
communication
not
merely
just
a
question
of
whether
you
can
picket
at
the
struck
plant.
thank
you.
