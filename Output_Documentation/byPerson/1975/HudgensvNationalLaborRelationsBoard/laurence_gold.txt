mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner’s
argument,
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
babcock
&
wilcox
test
which
we
have
been
discussing
applies
across
the
board,
no
matter
how
one
would
denominate
the
property
for
constitutional
purposes,
whether
it
would
be
a
purely
private
or
the
intermediate
public-private
type
of
property
at
issue
in
logan
valley
and
lloyd
at
least
in
the
constitutional
context
that
those
cases
arose
or
the
purely
public-private
property,
if
i
can
call
it
that,
of
marsh
and
of
other
cases
like
that
and
to
begin,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
was
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
participated
in
that
case,
but
as
you
can
appreciate
it,
we
tried
to
learn
from
the
subsequent
decisions
and
the
lesson
that
i
believe
has
to
be
drawn
from
the
majority
opinion
is
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
in
lloyd
versus
tanner,
the
majority
opinion
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
read
fully,
as
i
read
logan
valley,
it
equated
the
situation
in
marsh
and
the
situation
that
was
before
the
court
at
that
time.
i
can
only
read
the
majority
opinion,
however,
in
lloyd
to
reach
a
different
result
and
that
is
why
there
is
a
very
interesting
recent
case
which
judge
tuttle
wrote
the
opinion
which
the
petitioner
cites
in
his
reply
brief
at
519
migrant
workers,
it
is
in
519
fed
2
and
judge
tuttle
carves
up
the
area
into
three
different
categories
of
this
type
and
holds
that
in
that
case,
the
company
town
is
not
completely
dead
as
we
have
thought
but
there
was
one
in
existence.
this
is
not
a
rule
i
would
argue
for.
i
only
say
that
that
is
my
understanding
of
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
white,
of
marsh
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
show
that
the
message
that
you
are
communicating
is
one
which
is
directly
related
to
the
store
in
front
of
which
you
are
standing
or
to
the
general
shopping
center
area.
i
would
assume
that
after
lloyd,
if
antiwar
protesters
had
appeared
in
chickasaw
and
if
chickasaw
was
still
a
company
town
that
they
would
have
had
a
first
amendment
right
to
distribute
their
handbills
in
chickasaw
just
the
way
the
jehovah’s
witness
did.
but
my
understanding
of
lloyd
is
that
lloyd
does
not
overrule
logan
valley,
but
rather
states
that
the
property
is
not
as
fully
dedicated
to
the
public
and
that
there
are
first
amendment
rights
which
are
recognized,
but
they
are
narrower.
you
have
to
have
speech
which
is
directly
related
to
the
functions
and
purposes
of
the
shopping
center
and
that
is
why
i
think
that,
as
i
understand
the
constitutional
purposes,
there
are
three
different
types
of
property
that
we
are
discussing
at
least
functionally
and
when
we
discuss
them
in
terms
of
first
amendment
rights.
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
we
accept
--
mr.
laurence
gold
it
saved
it
as
an
open
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
disagree
with
that.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
mr.
justice
white,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
lloyd
was
inconsistent
with
logan.
i
meant
to
imply
that
there
is
language
in
logan
which
would
have
indicated
that
the
question
saved
in
logan
would
receive
an
affirmative
answer
when
it
was
posed.
that
was
not
the
case
when
the
question
was
finally
posed.
so
now,
i
was
saying
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
understand
there
to
be
a
difference
between
a
company
town
and
a
shopping
center
such
as
logan
or
lloyd
for
first
amendment
purposes.
the
question
before
us
here
is
whether
there
are
three
types
of
property
or
more
when
we
are
dealing
with
section
7
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
our
view
of
the
case
is
that
we
start
by
answering
the
petitioner
on
his
own
premise
which
is
that
all
these
types
of
property
are
the
same.
the
factory
in
babcock
&
wilcox
and
the
shopping
center
in
this
case
and
in
logan
and
central
hardware
and
lloyd.
and,
our
view
is
that
babcock
&
wilcox
teach
us
that
in
a
situation
in
which
entree
is
sought
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
with
employees
about
whether
or
not
they
should
become
organized.
the
act
is
centrally
neutral
as
to
where
the
activity
takes
place
and
that
the
basic
point
of
babcock
&
wilcox
is
that
the
property
rights
are
not
absolute.
the
national
labor
relations
act
enacts
its
own
system
which
displaces
private
rights
and
on
occasion,
that
it
has
also
had
been
a
lesson
of
republic
aviation.
it
is
the
lesson
of
such
cases
as
linn
and
letter
carriers
versus
austin
when
you
talk
about
the
rights
of
reputation,
and
that
what
was
necessary
was
to
draw
the
fair
inferences
out
of
the
statute
as
to
when
private
property
would
be
displaced.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
we
have
two
basic
points
that
i
would
make
on
the
alternatives.
first,
as
i
was
coming
to,
here
we
deal
not
with
organizing
activity
of
the
type
that
was
at
stake
in
babcock
&
wilcox,
but
with
picketing
in
support
of
an
economic
strike
at
the
strike
employer’s
facility.
now,
we
know
from
what
this
court
has
said
and
from
what
section
7
says
that
congress
did
not
merely
give
a
right
to
picket
somewhere.
it
had
in
mind
that
employers
could
continue
to
operate
when
they
were
faced
with
a
strike
and
that
unions
would
have
the
countervailing
weapon
of
peaceful
non-obstructive
picketing
at
the
location
in
which
they
would
attempt
to
convince
those
who
were
approaching
the
situs
to
buy
or
sell
or
otherwise
contribute
to
the
day-to-day
activities
of
the
employer
that
they
should
not
do
so.
and,
this
is
the
balance
that
the
act
strikes
and
it
is
our
view
first
of
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
a
right
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that,
just
as
this
court
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
at
the
business
situs,
in
the
words
of
the
steel-workers
case,
at
the
entrance
to
the
strike
facility.
that
is
where
you
have
a
fair
chance
to
employ
this
countervailing
method,
not
somewhere
far
away
whereas
even
mr.
come
acknowledged,
if
i
understood
his
answer
to
your
question,
i
believe
the
message
is
diffused
with
somebody
going
by
with
his
windows
rolled
up
in
atlanta
if
it
is
hot
or
cold
because
it
is
air
conditioned
most
probably
if
it
is
hot,
but
so
that
he
has
some
chance
to
see
the
sign,
see
what
the
message
is,
and
make
a
determination
whether
he
is
going
to
shop
at
butler’s
or
he
is
not
going
to
shop
at
butler’s.
we
think
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that
is
the
classic
confrontation
and
struggle
in
the
economic
strike,
and
we
think
that
the
fair
reading
of
cases
such
as
the
steel-workers
case
is
that
this
particular
place
is
the
preferred
place
at
which
to
carry
on
that
activity.
and
we
think
from
cases
like
american
ship
and
from
insurance
agents
that
it
is
not
for
the
board
of
a
court
to
say
that
there
may
be
some
other
way
to
do
it,
that
the
union
does
not
need
this
right,
that
the
employer
ought
to
be
safeguarded
from
it.
we
think
that
is
the
place,
and
we
think
the
inquiry
is,
is
this
the
entrance
way?
we
think
that
that
is
a
functional
question.
is
this
is
a
place
at
the
site
where
you
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
get
your
message
to
the
employer?
and
so
our
first
answer,
as
i
have
tried
to
indicate,
is
that
we
believe
that
in
this
circumstance,
you
do
not
apply
babcock
&
wilcox
which
dealt
with
quite
a
different
phenomenon
and
where
you
have
a
different
statutory
matrix
and
you
draw
different
inferences
from
the
statute,
but
you
deal
with
a
particular
section
7,
right,
that
we
have
here
at
stake.
we
think
congress
has
spoken
with
specificity.
we
think
that
the
only
way
for
congress’
will
to
be
carried
out
is
to
say
that
property
rights
give
way
to
the
extent
that
it
is
necessary
to
allow
people
to
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
reach
those
who
are
approaching
the
site.
now,
the
second
and
perhaps
even
more
long-winded
answer
i
would
have
to
the
question
you
asked,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
to
say
that
this
court
has
never
had
the
opportunity
since
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case
in
351
u.s.
to
say
what
reasonable
alternative
means
are.
mr.
cohen
says
that
as
long
as
it
is
theoretically
possible
with
the
expenditure
of
almost
infinite
resources,
at
least
from
the
union
point
of
view,
to
reach
people
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
it
is
our
point
of
view
that
the
basic
lesson
of
babcock
&
wilcox
is
that
you
reach
an
accommodation
which
works
the
least
destruction
to
the
rights.
as
we
understand
the
statute
in
this
situation
as
opposed
to
babcock
&
wilcox
situation,
the
statute
is
in
neutral
on
where
this
activity
takes
place.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
and
we
do
not
think
that
we
can
be
stripped
of
our
right
to
picket
in
support
of
our
economic
strike
at
that
site
and
we
do
not
think
that
we
can
be
relegated
to
taking
out
advertisements
and
so
on,
if
we
could
afford
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right,
and
i
would
point
out,
again,
only
if
i
understood
him
correctly
because
i
am
not
positive
i
did
and
i
know
he
will
have
rebuttal
time
and
will
speak
for
himself,
i
understood
him
to
admit
that
the
message
is
defused.
it
is
not
the
same
if
one
is
500,000
feet
away
at
a
place
where
vehicles
are
entering
and
so
on,
especially
where
you
have
60
stores
and
all
the
other
facts
that
are
here.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
clearly,
i
think
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
clearly,
i
think
we
have
the
right
to
picket
on
the
front
and
if
customers
were
also
entering
in
the
back
and
if
you
had
the
same
type
of
factual
situation
here
if
they
were
driving
on
to
this
lot
and
we
could
not
reach
them,
i
would
give
precisely
the
same
answer.
that
is
my
position.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
it
would
be
an
improper
and
unfair
definition
of
what
the
entrance
way
is
to
say
that
the
only
place
they
could
picket
would
be
out
where
the
cars
driving
off
the
public
street
with
all
the
problems.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right
and
there
are
walkways
around
the
store
as
people
exit
from
their
cars
and
walk
to
the
entrance
ways,
and
i
think
that
is
the
entrance
way.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
that
that
is
the
question
that
is
here.
i
do
not
think
we
know.
that
is
why
we
are
here.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
this
is
--
mr.
laurence
gold
it
is
an
in
hype
verb,
but
we
draw
the
understanding
out
of
this
court’s
opinions,
most
particularly
steel-workers
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
was
saying
that
section
7
gives
the
right
to
strike
and
picket
and
that
congress
had
certain
things
in
mind
when
it
granted
that
right
and
as
this
court
has
recognized,
one
of
the
things
it
had
in
mind
was
that
the
picketing
would
take
place
at
the
entrance
to
the
struck
site.
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
steel-workers.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
apologize
if
i
was
not
clear,
but
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
there
is
anything
in
hype
verb
in
the
statute
saying
the
statute
was
enacted
against
the
background
of
the
certain
understanding
and
that
has
been
the
understanding
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as
the
steel-workers
case.
mr.
laurence
gold
excuse
me.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
would
be
the
position
that
i
would
argue
for,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
support
of
an
economic
strike.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
and,
in
other
words,
i
am
seeking
to
answer
the
petitioner’s
argument
on
all
fours.
the
petitioner
argues
that
you
do
not
draw
the
line
between
different
types
of
property
but
have
on
test.
i
am
saying,
very
well,
we
accept
that,
that
we
are
drawing
fair
inferences
from
the
statute
and
in
light
of
steel-workers
and
the
other
cases,
we
think
this
is
the
fairest
inference.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
a
right
to
get
into
the
store.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
because
i
do
not
think
that
i
could
stand
up
here
with
a
straight
face
and
say
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
that
that
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
i
think
that
that
has
been
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
take
it
that
eventually
one
could
argue
to
go
inside
the
manager’s
office
or
anywhere
else.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
fair
inference.
i
do
think
that
the
fair
inference
is
that
the
employer
cannot,
by
its
property
rights,
cut
off
your
right
to
appeal
to
the
customers
to
use
this
one
weapon
that
congress
gave
you.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
on
your
own
property.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
this
instance,
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
would
not
ask
to
go
inside
the
door.
i
do
not
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
given
all
the
changes
that
i
--
mr.
laurence
gold
not
completely.
mr.
laurence
gold
on
the
chenray
point,
i
would
say
that
i
would
hope
that
the
least
that
would
come
out
of
this
case
would
be
that
the
court
would
articulate
the
standard
that
we
have
stated
and
remanded
for
a
determination.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
i
apologize
that
i
never
got
to
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
