unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
board
said.
unknown
speaker
how
far
away
that
the
public
highway
was
mentioned?
public
highway,
the
testimony
was
approx
--
unknown
speaker
it
had
a
right
of
way
that
you
said
they
could
have
picketed.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
it
is
the
only
chance
that
the
customers
headed
for
the
butler
store
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
have
been
as
effective
picketing,
i
gather,
addressed
the
consumers
as
it
was
picketing
in
front
of
the
stores.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
cut
that?
unknown
speaker
would
charity
not
require
it
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
facts,
mr.
cohen,
but
i
thought
you
said
that
this
public
right
of
way
was
off
the
public
highway,
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
so
would
you
quite,
would
you
at
that
spot,
the
traffic
problem
which
chief
justice
--
unknown
speaker
the
expense
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
reasonableness
of
the
alternatives?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
are
you
asking
affirmance
here
on
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
on
the
board’s
reasoning?
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
any
chenray
(ph)
problem
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
basis,
in
fact,
is
any
different
from
the
board’s?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
you
could
back
it
and
then
you
could
appraise
it
there?
unknown
speaker
you
are
now
telling
us
that
because
you
now
like
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
consider
the
cases
of
the
board
had
already
--
unknown
speaker
at
least
to
do
this
kind
of
picketing
at
the
business
situs?
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
argument
you
just
completed,
we
would
never
get
to
the
alternative?
unknown
speaker
it
finds
the
right
to
specify
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
to
picket
at
the
business
site?
unknown
speaker
or
even
to
move
away
500-feet
where
mr.
cohen
suggests
--
unknown
speaker
so
how
about
that
seers
roebuck
example?
you
are
familiar
with
that
store.
unknown
speaker
it
is
with
gordon
and
taylor.
you
know
how
you
have
to
get
in
there.
it
is
all
on
private
property.
you
go
up
ramps
and
you
park
and
i
gather,
as
many
people
come
in
from
the
parking
lot
which
is
elevated
into
the
upper
floors
as
coming
from
the
front
of
the
store.
how
about
that,
could
they
picket
up
there?
unknown
speaker
i
remember
that
gordon
and
taylor
you
are
a
block
away?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
--
unknown
speaker
after
you,
sir.
unknown
speaker
your
time
has
run
out,
but
there
is
just
one
question
that
i
would
like
to
ask
you.
do
you
support
affirmance
on
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
the
answer
is
no,
not
completely.
unknown
speaker
secondly,
then
what
do
you
do
with
the
chenray
point?
unknown
speaker
so
we
agree
we
will
have
to
remand
it,
would
we
not?
unknown
speaker
are
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
first
one?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
what
was
the
second
one?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
first
word?
unknown
speaker
v?
unknown
speaker
listening
to
mr.
gold,
he
would
have
disagreed
with
at
least
the
first
case,
would
he
not?
