mr.
cohen,
let
me
ask
you,
why
does
this
case
arise
under
the
national
labor
relations
act?
your
client,
the
petitioner,
did
not
employ
any
of
these
people.
they
had
no
dispute
whatever
with
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
then
arise
under
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
board’s
reasoning
carry
over
so
far
that
if
you
did
not
have
a
shopping
center,
but
had
a
simple
street
and
your
client
had
a
place
on
side
of
the
street
with
a
parking
lot
and
another
business
had
a
place
across
the
street
without
a
parking
lot
and
the
employees
of
the
place
across
the
street
wanted
to
organize
in
that
place,
but
they
could
not
find
any
access,
so
they
said
your
client’s
parking
lot
was
the
nearest
place
they
could
make
contact.
now,
do
you
think
the
board
will
say
that
your
client,
even
though
he
had
no
connection
whatever
with
either
the
employer
or
the
employees
that
were
in
the
dispute,
would
have
violated
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
argument
would
it
make
in
the
example
i
gave
you
where
it
was
simply
an
entirely
independent
business
premise
across
the
street
with
a
parking
lot?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
sounds
like
an
amalgamation
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
national
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
whose
ever
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
case
do
they
cite
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
position,
mr.
cohen,
how
do
you
reason
through
under
the
statutory
language
how
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
where
the
employer
does
not
employ
any
of
these
people
and
the
dispute
is
basically
between
one
of
his
tenants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
logan
valley
came
up
from
a
state
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
come.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
instead
of
the
shopping
center
situation
that
the
record
here
shows,
you
had
an
employer
on
one
side
of
the
street,
another
employer
on
the
other,
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
and
the
union
wanted
organizational
picket
on
the
employer
on
the
south
side
of
the
street,
but
there
was
no
real
access
there.
the
employer
on
the
north
side
of
the
street
had
a
parking
lot.
would
the
board
say
that
the
union
could,
in
fact,
conscript
that
employer’s
property
in
order
to
make
its
representation
to
the
employees
of
the
employer
of
the
south
side
of
the
street?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why,
for
purposes
of
the
act
as
opposed
to
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
my
hypothesis,
both
employers
would
be
important
in
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
you
have
found
that
hudgens
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
butler
unless
butler
told
hudgens,
in
effect,
“get
out
there
and
stop
those
people?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
a
much
different
fact
situation
than
this
though,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
makes
you
think
this
is
a
quasi
public?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
of
logan
valley
do
you
think
is
left
after
the
lloyd
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
the
right
to
strike
or
rather
to
picket
at
a
particular
site
was
itself
defined
in
the
statute.
where
is
that
definition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
section
and
what
language
are
you
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
it.
you
said
that
it
was
defined
in
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
not
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
