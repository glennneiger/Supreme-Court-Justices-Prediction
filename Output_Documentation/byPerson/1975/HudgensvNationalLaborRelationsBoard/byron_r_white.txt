justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
argument.
it
would
not
be
that
it
seems
that
your
client
was
not
subject
to
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
it
is
subject.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
you
did
not
think
the
board
was
holding
the
employer
as
having
been
able
to
predict
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
say
“sure,
you
are
an
employer
but
you
just
have
a
violation
of
the
act?”
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
where
ever
they
picket?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
upheld
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
ground,
do
you
think
that
the
board
knew
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
remand
or
did
they
themselves
applied
the
due
test
instead
of
send
it
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
what
the
court
should
do
with
respect
to
administrating?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
the
board
was
wrong
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
or
do
you
say
that
the
--
could
not
the
test
for
an
alternative
practice
be
different
than
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
i
thought
you
were
arguing?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
get
to
what
you
think
those
are
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
logan
valley
is
not
a
section
7
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
not
very
much
interested
in
having
this
court
say
“well,
there
was
not
any
violation
of
the
act
here
because
under
the
act,
you
can
only
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
these
circumstances
if
so
or
so,
and
that
these
facts
do
not
amount
to
unfair
labor
practice,
but
nevertheless,
if
you
wanted
to,
you
could
go
into
court
and
get
relief
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
make
that
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
us
to
in
effect,
decide
both
of
the
questions
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
thought
it
was
an
equated
what
it
thought
was
the
constitutional
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
very
happy,
i
suppose,
if
the
court
said
the
board
misunderstood
the
constitutional
test
and
then
the
constitutional
test
is
narrower
than
the
board
thought
it
was
and
it
is
no
broader
than
the
labor
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
happy?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
way
this
particular
employer
could
ever
get
before
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
could
not
possibly
ever
find
out
whether
the
behavior
is
protected
or
prohibited?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
might
run
into
a
secondary
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
like
you
were
ready
for
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
are
implying
with
complaint
more
of
consumer
picketing
at
the
interest
of
the
entire
shopping
center
than
picketing
in
a
single-employer
establishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
weekend
the
shopping
center
would
be
on
the
picket
backs
then,
i
suppose,
because
they
are
interfering
with
everybody’s
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
not
be
disruptive?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
will
be
causing
a
potential
loss
of
business
in
one
store?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
it
is,
then
how
do
you
say
that
is
so
disruptive?
you
said
it
disrupts
only
one
store?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
part
of
your
case
that
this
picketing
was
not
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
shopping
center?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
concede
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
how
you
think
it
was.
if
you
think
it
was
connected,
how
is
it
connected
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
certainly
related
for
constitutional
purposes.
how
about
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
issue
is
certainly
in
the
constitutional
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
constitutional
purposes,
will
this
be
related
under
lloyd,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
also
that,
for
consumer
picketing
purposes,
there
were
alternatives
to
having
a
public
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
namely,
you
mean
what,
the
press,
radio?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
board
concedes
or
has
it
even
indicated
how
the
case
would
come
out
under
a
straight
test
of
babcock?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
you
have
got
a
free-standing
store
on
the
fence
on
a
public
street
and
it
has
a
parking
lot
for
the
customers
behind.
customers
may
enter
from
their
cars
and
go
in
the
back
door,
they
can
go
in
off
the
street
and
the
employees
in
that
store
strike,
and
they
picket.
what
is
the
rule
with
respect,
they
picket
on
public
street
i
take
it,
may
they
go
onto
the
parking
lot
and
picket
right
in
front
of
the
back
door?
what
are
the
rules
of
the
board
with
respect
to
that?
is
that
a
babcock
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
there
is
a
gated
parking
lot
on
the
public
street
and
the
employees
could
just
as
well
picket
on
the
public
street,
but
they
say
“no,
it
is
much
more
effective
if
we
come
right
into
the
back
door
on
the
employer’s
parking
lot.”
now,
what
is
the
board’s
rule
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
care
about
the
answer.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
rule
that
would
apply?
what
would
be
the
test,
the
standard?
you
say
it
is
not
a
babcock
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
so
you
would
say
--
you
do
say
that
even
though
if
the
employer’s
own
employees
picketing
that
they
may
not
use
his
property
to
picket
him
and
the
consumer
picket
except
in
conformity
with
babcock.
if,
under
babcock,
they
have
other
reasonable
ways
of
doing
it,
they
cannot
go
on
his
property
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
come,
with
the
babcock
in
these
circumstances,
did
the
board
indicate
whether
that
test
would
be
satisfied
here
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rule
was
that
or
is
it
the
babcock
rule,
if
there
are
other
reasonable
means
of
getting
the
message
across,
private
property
rights
need
not
give
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
said
property
rights.
i
will
leave
off
the
word
“private,”
property
rights
need
not
give
way.
now,
i
just
ask
you.
if
that
test
were
to
apply
here,
would
there
be
other
reasonable
means
of
communication
or
not
and
what
is
wrong
with
applying
that
test
in
a
situation
like
this,
if
there
are
other
reasonable
means
of
doing
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
there
were
other
reasonable
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
constitutional
right
were
measured
that
way?
what
if
that
was
a
constitutional
rule,
that
property
rights
need
not
give
way
to
picketing
if
there
are
other
reasonable
means
of
getting
the
message
across?
what
if
that
were
the
constitutional
rule,
would
you
suggest
section
7
ought
to
go
further?
i
mean
--
yes,
section
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
chenray
says
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
invent
a
new
rule
and
then
make
the
fact
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
mean
we
ought
to
create
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
rule,
not
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
rule
is
not
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
say
lloyd
created
a
different
rule
than
logan?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
logan
saved
those
situations
where
it
might
be
said
that
the
activities
of
being
engaged
in
were
not
related
to
the
uses
to
which
the
shopping
center
was
dedicated?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
not
purport
to
say
that
the
logan
rationale
would
apply
where
the
activity
was
not
related?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
is
different
between
that
and
lloyd?
lloyd
deals
with
it,
but
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
lloyd?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you;
a
single
hardware
store
with
a
parking
lot
behind
it,
fronting
on
the
public
street,
entrances
in
front
and
back,
is
it
your
position
that
the
union
would
have
the
right
to
picket
the
back
door
as
well
as
the
front?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
employer’s
parking
lot?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
cases
in
this
one?
i
had
not
realized
that
you
could
picket
on
the
employer’s
own
property
if
there
was
some
alternative
place
to
picket?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
arguing
would
get
you
in
the
store
too,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
is
it
just
on
the
employer’s
property,
just
picket
inside
his
front
door?
it
is
most
accurate,
most
effective
way
of
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
standing
up
here
with
a
straight
face
just
outside
the
door.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
only
a
glass
door
between
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
your
own
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
the
employer’s
property
rights
must
give
way
if
it
means
that
that
gives
you
an
effective
way
of
operating?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
go
inside
the
door
too.
