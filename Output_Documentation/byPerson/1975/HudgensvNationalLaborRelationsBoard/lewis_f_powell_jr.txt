justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
come,
pursuing
the
discussion
you
and
mr.
justice
stewart
have
been
having,
assume
in
this
case
that
there
were
no
union
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer
with
respect
to
the
warehouse
employees
and
assume
further
that
the
union
was
attempting
to
organize
the
warehouse
employees.
would
your
position
be
the
same
with
respect
to
picketing
at
the
shopping
center
of
one
of
the
retail
of
this
employer?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
compatible
with
your
responses
to
mr.
justice
stewart?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
come,
just
one
more
question
before
we
leave
this
line
of
thinking.
as
i
understand
your
position,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
activity
at
the
warehouse
was
organizational
activity
or
a
dispute
as
to
wages
and
working
conditions
where
a
union
already
had
a
contract?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
on
site
why
the
organization
was
directed
against
the
employees
of
the
store.
here,
you
have
an
organizational
effort
at
one
location.
suppose
the
organization
there
had
been
in
seattle,
washington
with
the
same
employer.
could
the
union
have
posted
pickets
in
front
of
the
store
in
atlanta,
georgia
where,
with
respect
to
which,
there
was
no
union
organizational
activity
in
a
shopping
center?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
type
of
picketing
would
have
been
valid
on
the
parking
lot
of
central
hardware?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
draw
the
basic
distinction
between
organizational
activity
and
picketing
directed
toward
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
towards
the
customers
of
the
store?
