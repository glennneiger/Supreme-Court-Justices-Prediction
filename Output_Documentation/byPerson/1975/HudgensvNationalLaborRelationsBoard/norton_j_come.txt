mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principle
of
babcock
as
we
see
it
is
that
in
striking
a
balance
between
property
rights
and
employee
rights
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
accommodation
between
the
two
must
be
obtained
with
as
little
distraction
of
one
as
is
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
the
other.
now,
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
babcock
which
involved
non-employee
union
representatives
seeking
access
to
the
wholly
private
property
to
solicit
employees
to
join
the
union,
the
court
concluded
that
non-employees
could
be
excluded
except
where
it
could
be
shown
that
there
were
no
other
reasonable
means
of
reaching
the
employees.
we
submit
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
different,
and
therefore,
the
accommodation
for
purposes
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
could
properly
be
different.
a
property
is
not
wholly
private,
but
has
assumed,
as
this
court
used
the
phrase
in
central
hardware,
to
some
significant
degree,
a
functional
attributes
of
public
property
devoted
to
public
use.
secondly,
access
is
sought
by
employees
and
their
purpose
is
not
to
solicit
for
union
membership,
but
to
appeal
through
peaceful
picketing
to
customers
of
their
employer’s
retail
store
to
withhold
patronage
from
that
store
in
support
of
a
lawful
economic
strike
that
they
have
against
their
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
know
of
no
case
that
has
risen
before
the
board
presenting
that,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
two
situations
are
distinguishable.
mr.
norton
j.
come
first
of
all,
i
think
that,
for
purposes
of
the
act,
in
the
situation
that
you
are
positing
unlike
here
where
you
have
a
closer
interrelationship
between
the
shopping
center
owner
and
the
store
owner,
this
was
not
explored
in
this
case
because
the
party
stipulated
that
hudgens
was
an
employer
and
that
was
as
far
as
the
matter
went.
however,
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
however,
if
it
were
necessary
to
dispose
of
this
case,
findings
could
have
been
made
that
hudgens,
in
view
of
its
relationship
to
butler,
not
only
brought
butler
onto
this
center
in
terms
of
the
lease.
the
rent
that
hudgens
was
paid
was
dependent
upon
the
revenue
of
the
butler
store.
it
could
be
found
that
hudgens
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
butler
and
under
the
statutory
definition
of
employer
under
the
act,
it
includes
anyone
who
is
acting
as
an
agent
of
an
employer
either
directly
or
indirectly.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
act
also
has
a
very
liberal
definition
of
agency
which
says
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
has
not
been
any
specific
direction
or
authorization
is
not
controlling.
i
think
that
you
could
have
found
a
parent
authority
or
at
least
ratification
of
the
hudgens.
all
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
i
think
that
the
two
situations,
a
hypothetical
and
this
case,
are
factually
distinguishable
and
in
an
appropriate
case,
i
would
feel
confident
that
the
board
would
draw
the
distinction
that
i
am
drawing.
now,
turning
to
the
factors
that
i
have
mentioned
at
the
outset,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
situation
where
a
hudgens’
property
interest
is
substantially
attenuated.
the
shopping
center
is
the
kind
of
property
to
which
the
first
amendment
would
accord
a
broad
right
of
access.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
by
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
really
know
the
answer
to
that
because
i
think
that
you
do
have
the
factor
that
the
property
is
different.
in
one
case,
it
is
wholly
private
and
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
understand.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
the
property
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
nickel’s
case
that
was
alluded
to
by
my
adversary
would
indicate
that,
in
that
case,
the
board
would
have
applied
babcock.
i
am
not
so
sure
that
a
more
careful
thought
that
that
is
necessarily
correct,
but
for
the
moment,
that
is
the
state
of
the
board’s
law.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
not.
the
logic
of
that
would
lead
to
that
conclusion.
however
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
however,
i
must
point
out
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
board,
perhaps
more
than
usual,
is
feeling
its
way
because
its
view
of
this
has
had
to
be
refocused
considerably
in
the
light
of
this
court’s
decisions
in
central
hardware
and
lloyd
which
are
only
about
three
years
away.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
because
i
think
it
was.
as
i
understood
his
question,
he
gave
me
a
situation
where
it
was
purely
private
property
and
not
quasi
public.
i
think
that
on
quasi
public,
a
constitutional
test
is
very,
very
relevant
to
determining
the
proper
balance
for
section
7
purposes.
there
may
be
situations,
and
i
think
central
hardware
and
babcock
show
the
situation,
where
section
7
may
give
broader
rights
than
the
constitution
would
provide,
but
i
submit
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
say
that
section
7
would
ever
accord
less
protection
than
the
constitution
would
afford,
given
an
employer-employee
relationship.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
would
say,
yes,
i
do
not
think
that
it
makes
a
difference.
i
think
the
logan
valley
shows
you
that
because
in
logan
valley,
it
was
a
straight
organizational.
the
union
did
not
represent
anybody
in
the
store
that
they
were
a
vandalized
market,
but
nonetheless
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
as
i
understand
the
scope
of
the
protection
for
mutual
aide
protection
of
section
7
gives,
fellow
employees
have
a
right
to
appeal
--
employees
in
one
segment
have
the
right
to
appeal
to
fellow
employees
working
in
other
places
of
the
same
employer.
i
think
that
this
makes
it
a
much
easier
case,
however,
and
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
to
answer
the
case
of
the
purely
stranger
organizing
that
your
honor
posits
because
i
think
that
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
statute
which
regulates
organizational
picketing
might
enter
into
the
picture
and
impose
some
restraints
that
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
babcock
test
and
i
think
you
have
to
make
an
accommodation
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
reason
i
am
hesitating
is
that
i
do
not
know
of
a
case
that
exactly
presents
that
situation.
the
only
ones
that
i
am
familiar
with
are
situations
where
there
is
either
a
public
sidewalk
where
you
can
picket
or
there
is
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes?
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
depend
upon,
as
it
is
here,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
wholly
public
area
where
that
activity
can
be
reasonably
carried
on.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say,
in
that
sort
of
a
situation,
you
would
probably
find
that
the
public
places
would
afford
an
adequate
opportunity,
but
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
whether
they
do
or
do
not.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
that
situation,
it
would
be
the
babcock
test
because
that
is
not
quasi
public
property.
that
is
private
property.
mr.
norton
j.
come
except
that
where
picketing
is
involved
the
question
is
also
whether
there
is
an
alternative
public
facility
where
that
activity
can
be
carried
on.
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference
as
to
the
kind
of
activity
that
you
are
engaging
in,
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
this
case
because
here
we
have
quasi
public
property
and
lloyd,
we
submit,
makes
it
clear
that
the
constitution
would
have
given
these
employees
the
right
to
engage
in
peaceful
picketing
at
the
shopping
center
in
front
of
butler’s
place
of
business.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
petitioner’s
counsel,
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
stewart,
indicated
that
there
could
well
be
concurrence
between
the
constitution
and
the
statute
if
this
were
a
pure
company
town
such
as
we
had
in
marsh
against
alabama.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
logical
reason
why
there
cannot
be
such
concurrence
when
we
have
quasi
public
property.
the
difference
is,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
logan
and
in
lloyd,
where
you
have
quasi
public
property,
you
have
to
satisfy
two
conditions.
one,
you
have
to
show
that
the
activity
is
directly
related,
in
its
purpose
to
the
use
of
the
shopping
center
and
there
was
no
other
reasonable
opportunity
for
the
pickets
to
convey
their
message
to
their
intended
audience.
if
this
were
a
pure
company
town,
you
would
not
have
to
meet
those
tests.
now,
let
us
show
how
those
tests
are
met
on
the
facts
here.
although
the
underlying
contract
dispute
involved
butler’s
warehouse
employees,
they
were
engaging
in
what
would
normally
be
privileged
as
legitimate
primary
activity
in
carrying
their
dispute
to
their
employers
in
retail
store
and
seeking
the
aid
of
their
fellow
employees
working
there
and
of
the
store’s
customers.
to
be
sure,
hudgens’
own
title
to
the
property,
but
as
this
court
recognized
in
steel-workers,
the
fact
that
title
may
reside
in
a
third
party
does
not
necessarily
impair
the
legitimacy
of
otherwise,
primary
activity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
true,
but
in
a
sense
though
it
was
a
more
difficult
case
in
that
it
was
truly
private
property.
it
was
the
carrier
plant
and
it
was
the
railroad
entrance
to
that
plant
which
serviced
other
plants
that
was
on
property
owned
by
the
railroad.
here,
we
have
quasi
public
property.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
quasi
public
because,
in
all
material
respects,
it
is
like
the
shopping
center
in
logan
valley.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
quite
a
bit
of
it
is
left.
it
has
been
narrowed,
but
only
in
the
sense
that
you
have
to
meet
the
two
conditions
of
relatedness
and
a
showing
that
there
was
no
other
adequate
opportunity
for
conveying
the
picket’s
message.
i
think
that
the
court,
when
you
read
central
hardware
and
tanner
together,
draws
the
distinction
that
i
am
drawing
between
purely
private
property
and
a
shopping
center
such
as
we
have
here
in
lloyd
and
in
logan
valley.
the
store
picketing
was
directly
related
to
the
use
of
the
shopping
center
in
that
the
center
was
designed
to
attract
customers
to
the
stores
and
the
principal
purpose
of
the
pickets
was
to
induce
customers
to
withhold
their
patronage
from
the
butler
store
pending
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
with
butler
which
butler,
as
the
employer
of
most
of
these
employees,
the
warehouse
and
the
retail
stores,
was
in
a
position
to
resolve.
in
lloyd,
by
contrast,
the
message
on
the
handbills
which
protested
the
vietnam
war
was,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
directed
to
all
members
of
the
public
not
solely
to
the
patrons
of
lloyd
center
or
any
of
its
operations.
respondents
could
have
distributed
these
handbills
on
any
public
street
or
any
public
sidewalk,
in
any
public
park,
or
in
any
public
building
in
the
city
of
portland.
that
is
not
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
we
have
a
relatedness
that
would
satisfy
the
lloyd
and
the
logan
valley
tests.
secondly,
picketing
at
the
entrances
to
the
butler
stores
afforded
the
only
reasonable
means
of
conveying
the
picket’s
message
to
their
intended
audience.
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
this
is
not
an
organizational
campaign
where
it
is
often
times
relatively
easy
to
find
out
who
the
employees
are
and
appeal
to
them
at
their
homes.
you
are
appealing
here
to
the
patrons
of
butler
stores
whose
identity
is
not
readily
apparent
until
they
appear
at
the
store.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
you
can
talk
about
babcock
on
sever
levels.
you
can
talk
of
it
broadly
as
an
accommodation
which
i
alluded
to
at
the
outset.
you
can
talk
of
it
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
babcock
and
when
you
talk
of
it
in
those
terms,
it
does
not
fit
this
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
but
we
do
not
have
pure
private
property
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
there
are
no
other
reasonable
means
of
reaching
the
potential
customers
of
the
butler
store
that
you
are
not
trying
to
bring
to
the
store,
but
to
turn
away
from
the
store.
you
have
to
have
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
what
would
be
wrong
with
what
it
is
that
you
would
be
ending
up
with
a
lesser
right
under
section
7
than
the
constitution
would
give
you
on
this
particular
property,
and
i
submit
that
that
would
make
a
vindication
of
the
right
to
picket
and
strike
dependent
upon
whether
you
brought
suit
in
a
federal
court
or
you
brought
a
charge
before
the
labor
board.
i
submit
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
the
board
would
be
right
if
it
were
to
extend
it
further.
section
7
can
go
further
than
the
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
not
reasonable
to
say
that
it
goes
less
than
the
constitution
would
go,
particularly
in
the
situation
here
where
you
have
the
basic
rights
that
section
7
seeks
to
protect,
the
right
to
engage
in
a
peaceful
strike
and
peaceful
picketing
in
support
of
that
right.
section
7
and
the
board’s
procedures
were
uniquely
designed
to
deal
with
that
problem
and
to
force
employees
to
go
to
the
federal
courts
and
to
seek
vindication
under
the
constitution
would
put
the
law
back
to
where
it
was
before
the
wagner
act
was
enacted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
there
is
a
middle
situation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
had
problems
too,
but
i
think
we
have
to
start
with
tanner
as
a
given
and
having
that
as
a
given
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
but
this
court
interpreted
the
constitution
in
tanner
and
i
think
ended
up
with
a
middle
situation
which
although
is
not
as
much
state
action
as
a
company
town
in
marsh
against
alabama,
is
enough
state
action
to
invoke
the
constitutional
protections
provided
you
can
satisfy
the
relatedness
and
the
inability
to
make
the
appeal
on
public
property
test
and
we
believe
that
on
the
facts
here
the
board
has
satisfied
those
tests.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
on
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
that
the
board’s
reasoning
is
not
a
model
of
clarity
here,
but
i
think
that
there
is
enough
in
the
board’s
opinion
to
indicate
that
although
they
expressed
themselves
perhaps
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
because
i
think
that
the
board’s
opinion
indicates
that,
although
it
said
it
was
applying
babcock,
it
recognized
that
a
different
balance
was
called
for
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
if
the
board
had
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion,
i
am
quite
sure
of
it,
the
board
would
have
embraced
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
know
that
that
is
the
general
rule,
but
there
are
exceptions
and
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
those
that
fits
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
are
some,
your
honor,
particularly
where
what
you
have
here
really
is
an
interpretation
of
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
and
this
court
is
certainly
in
the
best
position
to
make
that
interpretation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
is
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
if
you
interpret
the
lloyd
and
central
hardware
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
the
board
has
made
adequate
fact
findings
to
fit
within
that
rule.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
law
develops
that
way.
the
board
learns
from
the
courts
of
appeals
and
from
this
court.
thank
you.
