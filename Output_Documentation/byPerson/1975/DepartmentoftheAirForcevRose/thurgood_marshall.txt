and
all
what
could
beat
him

been?
justice
thurgood

say
that
a
cadet
was
found
smoking
marijuana
in
the
basement
room
in
barrack
c,
there
is
nothing
identified
in

would
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
not
think
we

we
are
talking
about?

not
know
what

am
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
have
to
take
your
word
that
there
might
be
something
which
you
do
not
know
anything
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
give
me
one
example
i
might
be
able
to
understand
what
they
are
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall

whose
testimony
is
that
that

specifically
mention
the
group
that
the
man

justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
that
they
said
an
air
force
cadet
did
something?
how
could
i
rely
on
it?
how
could
i
rely
on
anybody’s
rumor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
won't
we
have
a
better
case
if
the
district
judge
looked
at
it
in
camera,
took
out
what
he
thought
should
be
taken
out
and
then
we
look
at
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.

about
are
those
that
are
in
this
--
on
a
man’s
office,
are
those
the
ones
you
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
it
be
a
personnel
file?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
it
involves
personnel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
the
record
of
all
of
the
guys
that
have
been
brought
up,
not
any
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
personnel
file
there
on
joe
black?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
joe
black
has
a
personnel
file
some
place
else
in
the
academy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
only
for
one
year?
justice
thurgood

they
are
not
available
to
the
general

after
that?
justice
