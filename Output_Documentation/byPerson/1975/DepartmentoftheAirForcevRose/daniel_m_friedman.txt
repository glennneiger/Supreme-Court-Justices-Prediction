mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
i
would
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
is
convenient
for
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.[lunch
break]
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
here
in
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
requires
the
disclosures
of
summaries
of
proceedings
conducted
at
the
air
force
academy
by
so
called
honor
and
ethics
board
or
committees.
these
summaries
contain
the
results
and
the
disposition
of
proceedings
conducted
by
cadet
groups
of
the
academy
for
the
enforcement
of
the
honor
code
and
the
honor
code
is
the
principal
issue
in
the
case
and
as
we
refer
to
it
the
proceedings
under
the
ethics
code
are
relatively
infrequent.
the
government
contends
that
these
summaries
are
exempted
from
disclosure
by
two
exemptions
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
exemption
6,
which
covers
personnel
and
medical
files
and
similar
files,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
and
exemption
2
which
covers
matters
related
solely
to
the
internal
personal
rules
and
procedures
of
an
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
legislative
history
does
indicate
that
in
that
phrase
congress
did
intend
there
to
be
a
balancing.
but
i
would
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
on
the
one
side
of
the
equation,
it
is
probably
the
more
accurately
might
be
phrased
as
the
interested
public
because
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
any
person
can
get
information
but
it
is
not
required
for
him
to
show
his
need
for
it.
i
think
it
is
a
general
public
interest.
but
in
considering
the
public
interest,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
information
is
sought.
but
may
i
just
add
by
way
a
preliminary
thing
that
our
first
submission
is
that
under
this
exemption,
you
never
reach
that
issue
because
as
i
shall
develop,
we
think
that
personnel
and
medical
files
are
protected
against
disclosure
without
regard
to
making
that
showing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
our
submission
mr.
justice.
that
is
our
submission.
and
then
we
go
on
to
say
but
in
any
event
in
this
case,
there
was
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion.
now
the
honor
code
of
the
air
force
academy
states
we
will
not
lie,
steal
or
cheat,
or
tolerate
among
us
any
one
who
does.
the
code
therefore
has
two
elements.
first,
the
substantive
development,
the
ban
on
lying,
cheating,
or
stealing
and
secondly,
the
toleration
clause,
and
what
this
means
is
that
the
code
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
cadets.
not
only
to
observe
these
requirements
themselves
but
to
report
anybody
who
fails
to
comply
and
in
many
instances,
of
course
what
you
have
is
a
cadet
report
that
he
saw
another
cadet
cheating
who
did
was
lying
or
doing
something
dishonest.
the
code
was
actually
created
by
the
cadet
core
and
it
is
the
cadet
core
that
administers
it
and
enforces
it.
if
a
violation
is
reported
to
someone
known
as
an
honor
representative
and
what
they
do
is
each
squadron
of
the
cadet
core
appoints
two
honor
representatives,
they
elect
them
in
fact
so
that
you
have
80
honor
representatives
whose
basic
responsibility
is
to
administer
the
code.
if
an
honor
violation
is
reported,
an
investigation
is
conducted
by
a
group
of
three
honor
representatives.
at
this
investigation,
they
take
statements
from
witnesses,
talk
to
the
cadet
involved.
if
his
result
of
this
investigation
it
appears
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
honor
code,
then
a
formal
proceeding
is
instituted.
a
board
of
eight
cadets
is
appointed
and
this
board
which
is
called
an
honor
board
or
an
honor
committee
then
conducts
a
hearing
at
which
the
cadet
appears
as
well
as
any
witnesses
the
cadet
wishes
to
call.
sworn
testimony
is
not
taken.
the
cadet
is
informed
that
he
has
the
right
to
make
a
statement
or
to
remain
silent
and
he
is
also
informed
that
he
has
the
right
to
call
any
witnesses
he
wishes.
there
is
no
cross-examination
and
counsel
is
not
permitted
to
be
present
at
the
hearing,
although
the
cadet
is
given
the
opportunity
prior
to
the
hearing
to
consult
with
legal
counsel
and
the
staff
judge
advocate's
office
at
the
air
force
academy.
this
procedure
that
i
have
mentioned
of
course
is
fully
consistent
with
the
basic
concept
that
this
code
is
administered
by
the
cadets
and
for
the
cadets.
now
if
at
the
conclusion
of
a
hearing,
the
committee
finds
the
cadet
guilty
of
the
alleged
violations
and
it
has
to
be
a
unanimous
finding,
the
cadet
normally
is
expected
to
resign
from
the
academy.
if
on
the
other
hand
they
either
find
the
cadet
not
guilty
or
they
find
him
guilty
but
with
something
called
discretion
which
means
that
despite
the
violation,
they
feel
it
is
appropriate
for
him
to
continue
at
the
academy
than
he
returns
to
the
student
body.
the
hearing
is
kept
confidential.
the
only
people
admitted
are
members
and
involved
and
a
certain
number
of
cadets
plus
those
officers
at
the
air
force
academy
who
are
directly
involved
in
conducting
the
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
proceedings
are
not
transcribed
mr.
justice.
there
is
a
man
called
a
recorder
who
makes
notes.
but
the
proceedings
are
not
transcribed
and
the
people
are
warned
at
the
hearing,
admonished
is
perhaps
a
better
word
that
the
proceedings
are
confidential
for
obvious
reasons
because
when
a
man’s
honor
is
at
stake
it
should
be
kept
confidential.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
only
in
the
sense
that
the
written
statements
are
taken.
only
in
the
sense
that
the
written
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know
what
goes
into
the
file
in
that
sense,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
only
difference
mr.
justice
is
this
and
if
i
may
come
just
to
that
in
a
minute
because
i
think
i
should
explain
what
happens.
there
is
no
transcript
taken.
and
the
record
shows
that
the
honor
committee
of
the
honor
board
does
not
either
makes
a
verbatim
or
summarized
transcript.
the
only
records
as
an
affidavit
in
the
record
states
are
brief
one
page
summaries
of
what
happened
and
these
summaries
state
what
was
found
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
prepared
by
the
recorder
of
the
board.
now
these
summaries
in
turn
are
then
distributed
to
each
of
the
cadet
squadrons.
there
are
40
squadrons
and
a
copy
of
the
summary
is
distributed
to
each
squadron.
if
the
man
is
found
guilty,
the
man’s
name
is
included.
if
the
man
is
either
found
not
guilty
or
there
is
discretion,
the
man’s
name
is
deleted
and
it
might
be
shown
as
cadet
x
and
cadet
y
or
something
like
that.
these
summaries
are
then
placed
upon
the
bulletin
board
in
each
squadron
in
a
file
which
says
on
the
top
of
it
“honor
case
summary
for
official
use
only.”
now
the
reason
these
–-
one
other
thing
in
the
case
of
either
not
guilty
or
discretion,
not
all
of
the
summaries
are
distributed
but
only
those
that
it
is
felt
by
the
board
of
the
honor
people
would
be
appropriate
as
illustrative
cases.
the
reason
they
are
distributed
to
each
of
the
40
squadrons
and
discussed
with
the
honor
representatives
in
the
squadron
is
that
the
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
the
code
lies
with
the
cadet
core
and
therefore
it
is
essential
to
the
cadet
core
to
know
the
decisions
of
this
honor
boards.
to
know
what
kind
of
conduct
was
deemed
to
violate
the
code,
what
kind
of
conduct
was
deemed
not
to
violate
the
code
and
what
kind
of
conduct
was
deemed
to
violate
the
order
but
excused.
so
i
think
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
the
summaries
are
in
effect
the
end-product
of
the
honor
board
proceedings.
they
are
in
actuality
the
only
record
of
the
proceedings
of
the
board
and
of
its
action.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
for
each
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
each
has
its
own
bulletin
board.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
40
copies
plus
a
few
additional
to
various
of
the
departments
that
should
have
these
information.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
generally,
until
the
end
of
the
academic
year.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
they
are
destroyed.
but
in
addition
to
that
there
is
a
master
file
which
is
kept
for
a
lengthy
period.
in
other
words,
in
the
office
of
someone
who
is
called
the
commandant’s
executive
for
honor
and
ethics
there
is
a
file
of
these
summaries
which
he
maintained.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
gain
access
to
the
summaries.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
names
deleted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect,
as
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
said
was
that
if
recognized
that
even
with
these
names
eliminated
there
was
a
great
danger
that
this
might
be
down
to
the
cadet’s
detriment
because
of
dredging
up
all
things
but
that
went
on
and
said
but
eliminate
the
names
and
maybe
you
can
eliminate
other
identifying
material
and
with
those
eliminations
we
hope
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
district
judge,
which
it
seems
to
us,
it
is
basically
inconsistent
with
the
court’s
previous
recognition
at
several
points
in
its
opinion
that
even
elimination
of
these
details
will
not
be
enough.
and
that
of
course
was
the
basis,
one
of
the
major
basis
on
which
the
air
force
refused
to
make
these
materials
available
because
they
said
three
points
in
the
record,
it
set
forth
in
various
affidavits
and
letters.
they
said
that
even
with
this
material
being
eliminated,
nevertheless
this
could
jag
the
memories
of
people
who
years
ago
had
remembered
something
and
this
could
be
down
to
a
cadet’s
detriment
for
the
rest
of
his
career.
and
that
is
the
basic
reason
we
have
taken
the
case
to
this
court
because
we
think
it
is
not
important
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
there
is
nothing
for
sure
but
all
i
can
say
is
this
indications,
they
say
that
in
the
record
and
i
was
advised
that
that
is
in
fact
the
general
practice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
honor
code
itself
i
would
think
mr.
justice
plus
the
fact
that
i
assume
the
cadets,
most
of
the
cadets
at
least
are
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
honor
code
and
the
importance
of
the
honor
code
and
the
importance
of
preserving
its
confidentiality.
i
suppose
a
cadet
could
do
that,
one
would
hope
that
a
cadet
would
not
do
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
well,
it
is
repeatedly.
it
is
repeatedly
urged
upon
them
and
stressed
that
this
is
for
official
use
only
and
that
the
material
is
confidential.
i
thought
that
the
chief
justice's
question
was
suggesting
you
might
have
a
bad
apple
in
the
barrel
who
would
go
out
and
take
copies
and
distribute
them.
it
is
possible
certainly
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
it
is
unlikely
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
has
been
no
experience
along
that
line
at
the
air
force
academy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
are
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
his
connection.
if
you
cut
out
all
of
the
identifying
details,
there
would
not
be
much
left
with
it.
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
is
involved
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
even
that
if
there
was
a
room
around
at
the
academy.
but
you
might
have
a
very
different
situation.
suppose
what
it
reported
was
that
a
cadet
in
a
thirteenth
squadron
or
whatever
it
is
called,
cheated
at
his
examination
in
mathematics
four,
before
in
captain
so
and
so's
class,
then
it
seems
to
me,
this
might
be
enough
to
the
small
group
of
people
connected
with
the
academy
to
someone
say,
“oh
that
is
the
fellow
who
did
it.
i
remember
that
story.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
the
problem
we
are
having
something
is
that
itself
would
breach
the
very
confidentiality
of
the
documents
to
have
something
because
the
whole
purpose
to
which
we
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
more
than
my
word
mr.
justice.
it
is
statements
by
two
officers
at
the
air
force
academy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
assistant
to
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
court
of
appeals.
if
i
may
refer
you
mr.
justice
to
page
11(a)
and
12(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
where
the
court
of
appeals
in
dealing
with
these
problems
stated
that
a
persons
privacy
may
be
as
effectively
infringed
by
reviving
dormant
memories
as
by
imparting
new
information.
for
example,
a
senior
officer
and
an
ex-cadet
might
upon
reading
a
summary
or
a
reference
to
it
realize
for
the
first
time
that
a
man
under
his
command
had
once
been
the
subject
of
academy
discipline.
it
would
be
called
comfort
to
the
junior
officer
to
be
told
that
his
chief
had
always
known
this
fact
anyhow.
although
he
had
long
forgotten
it
or
it
never
made
the
ultimate
connection
among
various
bits
of
knowledge
until
the
article
junk
has
recollected.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
nothing
in
that
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
what
they
are
seeking
mr.
justice.
they
are
seeking
these
summaries
with
as
they
described
it
the
names
and
identifying
details
deleted
while
to
make
the
document
effective,
to
make
the
document
effective
so
that
it
will
show
nothing
that
would
permit
the
identity
of
the
cadet
to
be
discerned
that
would
in
effect
eliminate
all
of
the
stuff.
if
they
want
to
find
out
they
say
is
to
find
out
precisely
how
this
code
in
application
has
dealt
with
these
concepts
of
lying,
cheating,
and
stealing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
might
have
a
better
case
but
we
do
not
think
that
is
what
the
statute
requires.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
court
does
know
mr.
justice
on
the
basis
of
these
affidavits
explaining
how
and
why
the
release
of
this
information
would
and
could
have
a
very
serious
consequence
upon
the
future
careers
of
these
cadets.
that
is
when
we
are
talking
about
personal
privacy;
it
seems
to
me
the
essence
of
it
is
to
protect
the
publication
of
this
information.
this
is
privacy.
these
are
men,
some
of
them
many
years
ago
when
they
were
relatively
young
got
into
a
strike.
they
did
something
bad.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
could
be
15
or
20
years
ago.
the
air
force
academy
started
1955.
so
this
is
a
man
who
is
now
in
the
middle
of
his
career
and
suddenly
something
like
this
comes
out
or
junior
officer
to
have
them
two
or
three
years
ago,
perhaps.
and
at
that
point,
it
was
all
taken
care
of.
but
it
was
forgiven
and
lo
and
behold,
it
is
suddenly
brought
up
again.
that
is
the
problem.
that
is
the
problem
that
we
are
dealing
with.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
about
4200
roughly
a
thousand
a
class.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
in
the
case
of
guilty,
each
of
these
summaries
would
be
distributed
and
placed
on
the
bulletin
board
in
each
of
the
squadrons.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
does
not
purport
to
do
that
but
i
think
the
essence
of
the
honor
code
is
that
you
will
behave
as
an
honorable
individual
that
you
normally
would
not
disclose.
we
cannot
be
sure.
we
cannot
be
sure
that
some
years
later,
someone
will
not
disclose
this
but
it
seems
to
us
that
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
this
system.
but
we
are
concerned
about
is
making
public
information
that
would
jog
old
memories
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
could
lead
people
who
had
long
since
forgotten
about
this
to
recall
it
to
memory.
and
that
is
the
thing
that
is
concerning.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know
i
suspect
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
would
not
mr.
justice.
it
would
not
be
put
in
his
personnel
file
but
it
would
be
put
in
the
general
reading
file,
the
general
file
of
all
of
these
things.
but
we
do
not
think
the
fact
that
the
individual
that
is
not
in
his
201
file
necessary
means
it
is
not
a
personnel
file
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
let
me
if
i
may
get
to
our
first
legal
occupant
which
is
these
are
personnel
files
and
that
the
statute
does
not
require
a
showing
that
the
disclosure
of
either
personnel
or
medical
files
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
even
though
as
i
have
indicated
to
justice
powell,
this
material
is
not
in
included
in
the
technical
personnel
file,
we
think
it
is
part
of
the
personnel
file
because
it
deals
with
the
conduct
of
discipline
of
the
activities
of
an
individual.
this
is
the
record.
this
is
the
only
record
of
this
man’s
behavior.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
presumably
if
he
is
found
not
guilty
or
discretion,
i
suppose
it
should
not
have
any
but
i
just
do
not
know
because
this
is
all
again
kept
confidential
within
the
air
force
academy,
i
just
do
not
know.
now,
the
language
that
i
have
referred
to
is
personnel
and
medical
files
and
other
files,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
similar
file,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
somewhat.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
which
we
have
discussed
at
considerable
length
in
our
reply
brief
indicates
that
the
first
bill
that
really,
there
were
number
of
early
bills
but
there
were
two
basic
bills
in
the
88th
and
89th
congress
which
culminated
the
freedom
of
information.
the
first
bill
had
no
provision
at
all
exempting
personnel
files,
medical
files,
or
similar
files
and
it
apparently
was
on
the
assumption
that
most
of
these
files
were
protected
by
other
statutes.
but
if
the
hearings
on
these
bill
there
was
complaint
by
a
number
of
witnesses
that
they
were
vast
quantities
of
government
files
which
contained
a
lot
of
personal
information
and
that
should
be
protected
and
they
specifically
referred
to
personnel
files
and
medical
files.
and
following
that
hearing
the
senate
added
an
amendment
to
the
bill
which
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
of
our
reply
brief.
and
as
originally
drafted,
the
amendment
provided
an
exemption
for
personnel
files,
medical
files,
and
similar
matter
the
disclosure
of
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwanted
invasion
of
personnel
privacy
and
the
committee
report
on
that
bill
stated
that
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
7,
in
an
effort
to
indicate
the
types
of
records
which
should
not
be
generally
available
to
the
public,
the
bill
lists
personnel
and
medical
files.
and
since
that
would
be
impossible
to
name
all
such
files,
the
exemption
contains
the
wording
and
similar
records
the
disclosure
of
which
would
be
constant
and
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
now,
we
think
in
the
light
of
that
committee
report
and
the
language
as
originally
drafted,
congress
intended
the
disclosure
requirement
to
modify
only
similar
matter
and
to
provide
an
unqualified
immunity
for
personal
file,
personnel
files,
and
medical
files.
when
congress
finally
enacted
the
freedom
of
information
act,
they
changed
that
language
to
the
present
language
in
the
bill
and
what
they
did
was
eliminate
the
commas,
combined
personnel
and
medical
files
into
one
category
and
substitute
for
the
word
similar
matter,
the
word
similar
files.
again,
the
legislative
history
that
we
have
quoted
shows
that
congress
wished
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
personnel
and
medical
files.
and
we
do
not
think
this
change
in
language
was
intended
to
make
any
change
in
the
basic
design
the
basic
purpose
which
led
to
the
insertion
of
this
provision
in
order
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
personnel
files
and
medical
files.
congress
in
effect
made
a
judgment
that
the
disclosure
of
personnel
and
medical
files
necessarily
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
and
then
went
ahead
and
recognized,
there
were
other
files
which
contained
similar
damaging
material
and
it
therefore
provided
an
additional
exemption
for
those
of
the
similar
files
whose
disclosure
would
have
this
serious
impact
upon
personal
privacy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
on
the
predecessor
bill,
yes
mr.
justice
but
may
i
refer
you
to
page
9,
the
material
we
have
quoted
in
the
middle
of
the
page
which
is
the
report
on
the
final
bill
which
in
discussing
the
general
purposes
of
the
act
pointed
out
that
while
they
were
enacting
a
broad
philosophy
of
freedom
of
information,
it
was
necessary
to
protect
certain
equally
important
rights
of
privacy
with
respect
to
certain
information
in
government
files
such
a
medical
and
personnel
records.
so
we
think
once
again,
this
reflects
the
basic
congressional
intent
and
philosophy
to
protect
the
privacy
of
personnel
and
medical
files.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
and
the
significance
of
the
distinction
is
that
if
they
are
personnel
files
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
responsiveness,
our
analysis
of
the
statute
that
that
is
enough,
that
is
enough
to
prove
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
congress
itself
has
made
the
judgments
to
personnel
and
medical
files
and
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
of
course
if
the
respondents
are
right,
if
the
respondents
are
right
that
you
have
to
make
the
showing
with
respect
to
the
disclosure
of
personnel
files,
you
would
also
by
the
same
token
have
to
make
the
disclosure
with
respect
to
medical
files
and
of
course,
there
is
a
well
recognized
privilege
for
communications
between
patient
to
doctor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
it
is
the
summaries
contained
in
the
file
in
the
honor
executive’s
office
and
it
is
the
same
material
that
has
been
distributed
to
the
squadron.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
it
more
than
just
involves
personnel.
it
deals
with
the
individual
cadet
involved,
it
is
the
record.
it
is
the
only
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
it
is
individual
records.
it
is
the
records
relating
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
there
is
no
personnel
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
does
but
that
in
terms
of
the
basic
policy
of
exemption
6,
we
think
that
congress
did
intend
this
kind
of
material
to
be
treated
as
a
personnel
file
because
its
disclosure
would
have
this
adverse
impact.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
but
nevertheless,
nevertheless
there
is
file
in
the
academy
which
contains
these
summaries
relating
to
the
individual
cadets
and
it
seems
to
us
this
deals
with
personnel.
this
is
the
only
record.
this
is
the
only
record
showing
what
has
happened
to
this
man
in
terms
of
his
honor
board.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
within
the
definition
of
exemption
6,
yes.
within
the
definition
of
exemption
6,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
will
not
be
a
copy
of
the
summary
in
that
file.
now
i
would
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
but
i
would
assume
so
mr.
chief
justice
because
once
the
man
has
been
found
not
guilty
or
once
discretion
has
been
exercised,
as
far
as
the
air
force
is
concerned,
he
has
a
clean
slate
and
they
do
not
want
this
to
follow.
indeed,
the
danger
is
that
the
concern
is
that
years
later,
this
thing
will
suddenly
be
dredged
up
and
that
is
all
spelled
out.
the
concern
is
all
spelled
out
as
i
indicated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
various
items
in
the
record
and
we
believe
that
that
shows
that
even
if
this
is
viewed
as
similar
file,
nevertheless
the
effect
of
disclosing
it,
would
constitute
a
clear
invasion
of
personnel
files.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
are
relying.
i
am
sorry
if
i
gave
the
wrong
impression
mr.
justice.
we
are
relying
on
exemption
2,
and
we
have
discussed
the
exemption
2
both
in
our
main
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief.
we
think
these
are
also
covered
by
exemption
2,
but
exemption
6
has
been
the
major
focus
of
this
litigation
in
this
court
and
that
is
why
i
have
dealt
with
it
in
the
oral
argument?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
a
concern
as
indicated
in
the
record
that
the
essence
of
this
is
confidentiality
and
the
toleration
clause
in
particular
under
which
cadets
feel
obligated
and
do
report
violations,
they
might
be
very
reluctant
to
report
violations,
if
all
of
this
stuff
came
out,
i
mean
i
think
the
code
operates
the
basic
rationale,
the
basic
procedure
and
method
on
which
the
code
operates
is
that
it
is
being
kept
confidential.
this
is
a
matter
within
the
cadet
core,
this
is
not
going
to
be
made
public.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
expect
my
time
might
have
expired
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
thank
you.
well,
i
have
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
very
briefly.
first
with
reference
to
what
happens
to
these
summaries
whether
they
are
available
for
member
of
the
public
to
see.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
page
187
of
the
record,
where
an
affidavit
of
general
galligan
was
a
commandant
of
cadets.
he
states
in
the
middle
of
the
page
of
this
case
summary
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
187
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
which
is
an
affidavit
by
general
galligan
who
is
the
commandant
of
cadets
at
the
air
force
academy
in
the
middle
of
page
he
says,
these
cases,
summaries,
and
records
are
not
handled
indiscriminately
at
the
united
states
air
force
academy.
and
he
says
the
sole
purpose
in
providing
copies
to
the
cadet
squadron
faculty
departments,
mission
elements
to
provide
guidance
and
instruction.
so
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
from
this
that
these
things
are
not
generally
thrown
around
the
academy
that
anybody
who
happens
to
walk
in
can
see
what
is
going
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mission?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
way
things
are.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
far
as
segregating
out
disclosable
and
non-disclosable
things.
i
think
with
certain
matters
it
did
but
where
you
have
a
situation,
whereas
we
claim
the
whole
file
is
non-disclosable,
we
do
not
think
the
amendment
says.
and
then
if
i
may
just
say
one
thing
in
closing.
mr.
parker
referred
to
the
purposes
of
exemption
6
which
was
to
protect
against
disclosure
of
intimate
details
of
a
person's
life,
that
he
would
not
want
to
have
disclosed,
we
say
that
is
precisely
what
making
public
these
summaries
would
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
have
no
question
mr.
justice.
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief.
we
have
no
question
that
a
court
could
examine
something
in
camera
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
personnel
file
or
medical
file
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
if
the
court
would
have
hold
that
these
are
not
personnel
files
but
is
something
else
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
i
do
not
think
under
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
argument
as
i
understand
that
mr.
justice,
the
argument
as
i
understand
is
not
that
the
court
should
examine
it
in
camera
to
determine
if
it
is
a
personnel
file
but
to
examine
it
in
camera
to
see
whether
or
not
by
excising
certain
material,
it
can
now
be
safely
disclosed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
i
think
if
they
find
that
it
is
a
personnel
file,
i
think
that
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry
because
they
would
take
it
one
step
beyond
and
say
it
can
be
senate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
well,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
that
these
are
if
not
personnel;
similar
files
that
court
of
appeals
so
treated.
then
he
would
have
the
further
step
i
suppose
of
determining
whether
the
disclosure
of
this
material
would
result
in
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
there
is
a
citation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
there
is
a
citation
in

daniel

our
brief
i
know.
yes,
it
is

of
the

you.
