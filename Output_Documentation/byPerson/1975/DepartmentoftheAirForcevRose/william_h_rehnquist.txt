does
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
modifies
only
the
similar
files?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
balancing
on
the
other
side,
under
the
unwarranted
clause,
do
you
look
at
the
courtâ€™s
conception
of
the
importance
of
the
need
that
is
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs.
i
mean,
if
it
were
just
idle,
if
someone
came
in
and
admitted
that
was
just
idle
curiosity
and
not
to
write
a
law
review
article,
would
that
perhaps
require
a
different
outcome
in
one
case
and
another
under
the
unwarranted
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
read
the
unwarranted
language
as
modifying
personnel
and
medical
files
too
as
well
as
similar
files?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
give
the
answer
you
did
to
justice
brennan.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
are
wrong
on
that
point,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
congress
has
given
a
flat
exemption
to
personnel
files.
and
that
the
fact
that
personnel
files
might
have
been
publicized
in
some
other
way
gives
no
indication
that
congress
would
want
the
exemption
to
be
less
applicable
in
that
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
they
really
said
was
that
the
privacy
act
would
not
prohibit
being
made
available.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
1974
provision
that
you
are
relying
on
in
your
brief?
