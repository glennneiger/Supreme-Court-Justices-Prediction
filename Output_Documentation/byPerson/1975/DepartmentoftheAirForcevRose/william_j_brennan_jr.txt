the
united
states
air
force
academy
has
an
honor
code.
under
that
code,
cadets
pledge
that
they
will
not
lie,
steal,
or
cheat,
or
tolerate
among
their
numbers
anyone
who
does.
now
that
code
is
administered
by
an
honor
committee
composed
of
academy
cadets.
alleged
violations
of
the
code
are
adjudicated
by
that
committee
and
the
consequences
for
a
cadet
found
guilty
of
the
violation
can
be
very
serious
indeed.
there
is
also
an
ethics
code,
violations
of
which
are
breaches
of
conduct,
less
serious
than
honor
code
violations
and
that
code
too
is
cadet
administered.
records
are
prepared
and
retained
by
both
the
honor
code
and
ethics
code
committees,
respecting
the
adjudication
of
violations
they
hear,
in
honor
code
violations,
for
example,
the
case
summaries,
usually
only
a
page
are
prepared
and
posted
on
40
squadron
bulleting
boards
throughout
the
academy,
but
with
except
in
cases
of
guilt
findings
of
serious
offenses
with
the
names
of
the
cadets
involved
deleted
and
alike
distribution
is
made
of
ethics
code
summaries.
confidentiality
of
these
summaries
was
maintained
by
academy
custom
and
practice
in
the
sense
that
cadets
generally
are
instructed
not
to
read
them,
except
when
they
seek
guidance
as
to
the
conduct
that
falls
within
or
without
the
codes.
now
this
case
arose
when
the
respondents
who
are
students
or
were,
when
the
case
was
brought,
students
at
new
york
university
law
school
and
editors
of
its
law
review,
sought
access
to
both
honor
and
ethics
code
summaries
for
personal
references
or
other
identifying
information
deleted
however.
in
connection
with
their
law
review
article
on
the
subject
of
disciplinary
procedures
and
systems
at
the
military
service
academies
generally,
because
i
gather
both
the
naval
academy
at
annapolis
and
the
military
academy
at
west
point
also
function
under
honor
codes.
but
when
the
academy,
the
air
force
academy
that
is,
and
the
department
of
the
air
force
denied
access,
the
respondents
brought
this
action
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
and
the
air
force
defended
the
action
on
the
ground
that
the
exemption
or
rather
that
the
summaries
were
exempt
from
disclosure,
are
specific
exemptions
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
itself,
namely
exemption
2
that
exempts
matters
related
solely
to
the
internal
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency
or
under
exemption
6
that
exempts
personal
and
medical
files
and
similar
files,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
and
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
new
york
dismissed
the
suit,
holding
that
indeed
exemption
2
did
exempt
the
summaries
from
disclosure
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
exemption
2
did
not
exempt
the
summaries
from
disclosure
and
then
turned
to
exemption
6,
and
held
that
exemption
6,
at
least
in
respect
of
the
determination
required
by
that
exemption,
namely
whether
a
disclosure
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
of
the
cadets
or
the
subjects
of
the
summaries,
required
that
the
summaries
be
turned
over
to
the
district
court
for
in
camera
inspection,
and
that
the
air
force
cooperate
with
the
judge
in
redacting
the
summaries
so
as
to
delete
personal
references
and
all
other
identifying
information
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
in
camera
procedure,
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
will
further
the
statutory
goal
of
exemption
6,
which
enacts
a
workable
compromise
between
individual
rights
and
preservation
of
public
rights
to
government
information.
these
limited
statutory
exemptions
can’t
obscure
the
basic
policy
that
disclosure,
not
secrecy,
is
the
dominant
objective
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
the
public
does
have
a
substantial
concern
with
the
air
force
academy’s
administration
of
disciplinary
procedures
that
affect
the
training
of
air
force
officers
and
their
military
careers.
