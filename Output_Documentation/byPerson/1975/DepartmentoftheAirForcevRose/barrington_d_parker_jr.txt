mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
deputy
solicitor
general
has
indicated,
this
case
presents
for
the
court’s
consideration,
the
scope
of
two
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
exemption,
exemption
6
relating
to
personnel
and
medical
files
and
similar
files,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
constitute
a
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
an
exemption
2
which
pertains
to
matters
related
solely
to
the
internal
personnel
rules
and
practices
of
an
agency.
the
documents
sought
are
case
abstracts
of
adjudications
by
the
air
force
academy’s
honor
and
ethics
code
committees.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is.
these
abstracts
are
sought
with
all
names
as
well
as
all
other
identifying
references
deleted.
the
documents
will
be
used
in
connection
with
the
study
of
due
process
at
the
nation
service
academy
as
being
conducted
under
the
auspices
of
the
new
york
university
law
review.
now
the
documents
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
the
plaintiff
is
a
former
member
of
the
nyu
law
review.
the
other
two
respondents
are
former
editors-in-chief
of
the
review.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
mean
in
connection
with
there,
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
work
was
being
done
in
connection
with
there
work
for
the
review.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
unfamiliar
with
that
disclaimer,
yes
sir.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
understand
that.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
no
sir,
they
were
at
the
time
at
various
stages
during
administrative
proceedings.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
pardon
me.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
documents
have
been
sought
for
the
sole
purpose
of
determining
the
substantive
content
of
the
academy’s
honor
and
ethics
code
as
the
code
has
been
applied
on
a
case
by
case
basis
at
the
academy.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
no
sir,
there
is
not.
all
of
the
empirical
source
material
to
back
up
the
moment
the
study
has
been
published
but
pursuant
to
an
arrangement
with
the
new
york
university
law
school,
all
of
the
empirical
source
material
which
reflects
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
man
hours
of
work
and
investigation
and
interviews
and
so
forth
will
be
made,
will
be
collected
and
maintained
at
the
new
york
university
law
school.
and
anyone
who
is
interested
in
the
documents
substantiating
the
underlying
certain
conclusions
in
the
study
and
refer
to
the
source
material
which
will
be
on
file.
if
these
case
abstracts
are
produced
and
to
the
extent
they
are,
they
will
be
on
file
there.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
there
is
discussion
of,
that
was
one
of
the
major
problems
and
in
terms
of
the
timing
of
the
publication
of
the
study
they
had
to
publish
it
before
the
adjudicative
process
had
ended.
but
i
would
also
like
to
stress
that
of
course
there
is
no
standing
requirement
under
this
act
documents
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--
are
to
be
made
available
to
any
person.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
the
second
circuit
solicited
views
on
that
question
and
both
our
responses
and
the
responses
of
the
government
are
part
of
the
record
and
neither
of
us
believe
that
the
controversy
was
moot.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
there
was
a
continuing
interest
on
the
part
of
the
respondents
in
these
documents.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
primary
focus
of
the
act
is
public
access
to
information.
in
connection
with
this
exemption,
i
believe
there
is
support
in
the
legislative
history
for
the
approach
that
the
reasons
for
which
documents
are
sought
may
be
considered
but
the
primary
focus
there
is,
this
is
with
respect
to
exemption
6,
i
believe
is
simply
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
and
if
so,
how
great?
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
unwarranted
language
is
designed
to
authorize
the
court
to
look
at
the
seriousness
of
the
likelihood
that
somebody’s
privacy
will
be
invaded
and
as
i
will
explain
in
a
moment
your
honor,
i
think
in
connection
with
the
disclosure
of
these
abstracts,
there
is
no
reasonable
probability
that
anybody’s
privacy
will
be
invaded.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
that
the
reasons
for
which
documents
are
sought
given
the
scheme
and
the
philosophy
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
are
secondary
and
even
tertiary
considerations.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
believe
mr.
justice.
i
certainly
do
not
believe
and
i
would
not
concede
that
there
is
a
realistic
kind
of
invasion
of
personnel
privacy
when
we
are
talking
about
disclosing
documents
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
they
did.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
there
concern.
the
substantive
case
abstracts
which
are
sought
would
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
something
documenting
the
substantive
content
of
the
honor
code
to
show
what
fact
patterns
or
what
conduct
has
been
thought
to
consider
to
amount
to
lying,
cheating,
stealing,
or
tolerating.
i
would
like
to
stress
that
the
case
abstracts
in
an
unedited
form
which
include
the
names
and
salient
facts
are
posted
in
40
different
locations
around
the
academy
and
they
are
available
for
inspection
and
discussion
among
thousands
of
cadets
and
also
the
employees
or
administration
at
least
and
the
faculty
of
the
academy.
and
i
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
because
of
any
air
force
regulation,
cadets
are
prescribed
and
talking
about
these
matters
among
themselves
or
among
non-academy
air
force
officers
later.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
pardon
me.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
that
they
opposed
it?
yes
sir,
but
they
are
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
they
are
not.
that
is
correct.
they
are
not
available.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case.
it
is
my
understanding
on
the
record
here
that
the
case
files
which
are
collected
in
the
master
binder
are
available
for
review
by
the
cadets
at
any
time.
so
you
have
there
really
a
historical
collection
of
these
abstracts.
not
simply
for
one
year.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
any
cadet
i
believe
who
is
interested
in
what
and
how
the
academy
has
functioned
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
after
one
year?
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
changes
the
case
at
all.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
oh!
that
is
correct.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
they
are
available
to
cadets
generally
when
they
are
posted
that
is
why
they
are
posted.
the
facts
of
the
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
believe
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
has
indicated
that
these
bulletin
boards
are
not
available
to
the
public
generally
and
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what
that
means?
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
it
means
they
are
unavailable
to
the
public
period
or
at
any
time.
i
am
just
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
am
just
puzzled
as
to
what
that
means.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
the
record
supports
that
and
i
did
not
so
read
that
statement.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
no
and
by
the
same
token
there
is
no
indication
of
the
other
way.
now,
these
honor
and
ethics
abstracts
are
not
personnel
files.
the
air
force
has
its
own
regulations
sharply
distinguished
between
medical
and
personnel
files
on
the
one
hand
and
files
similar
to
personnel
files
on
the
other
hand
and
state
that
files
relating
to
disciplinary
matters
are
to
be
considered
similar
files
and
are
to
be
disclosed
so
long
as
there
is
no
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
it
could.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
we
insist
that
the
fact
that
these
case
abstracts
might
initially
have
been
contained
in
a
file
which
was
labeled
a
personnel
file.
it
is
not
dispositive
in
view
of
the
wide
intra-agency
distribution
that
takes
place
thereafter.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
presumably.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
unless
that
separation
is
made,
the
texture
of
b(6)
becomes
completely
open
ended,
because
you
are
then
talking
about
a
situation
where
theoretically
a
relationship
with
personal
matters
can
make
any
document
such
as
the
ones
here
which
are
widely
disseminated
for
instructive
and
didactic
purposes.
a
personnel
file
and
i
just
do
not
believe
that
is
what
congress
intended
when
it
acted
exemption
two
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
would
tend
to
support
me
on
that.
i
think
when
we
talk
about
a
personnel
file
as
the
term
is
generally
used,
we
talk
about
the
file
that
is
maintained
in
the
personnel
office
of
an
employer
or
an
agency
and
its
other
file
that
contains
an
employee’s
application,
his
attendance
record,
the
results
of
a
civil
service
exam
or
something
or
information
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
when
congress
enacted
exemption
6,
it
was
concerned
with
protecting
intimate
information
about
an
individual
which
could
be
correlated
with
that
individual.
now,
once
you
open
up
the
file
and
take
documents
out
and
start
and
post
them,
i
think
that
consideration
has
been
vitiated.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
qualification
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy,
modifies
personnel
files,
medical
files
as
well
as
similar
files.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
that
is
a
hypothetical
question
and
that
would
be
correct
your
honor.
but
let
me
stress
that
the
legislative
history
of
exemption
6,
if
we
are
focusing
not
on
earlier
versions
or
earlier
drafts
or
comments
and
earlier
versions
but
the
final
house
and
senate
reports,
indicate
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
per
se
exemption
for
medical
and
personnel
files.
we
quote
from
the
legislative
history
on
page
13
to
14
of
our
brief
but
congress
said
and
i
think
that
their
intent
is
stated
here
quite
clearly
that
while
the
exemption
is
intended
to
cover
detailed
records
on
an
individual
which
can
be
identified
as
applying
to
that
individual,
the
exemption
not
any
particular
clause
in
the
exemption
but
the
exemption
itself
does
not
apply
to
the
factual
matters
such
as
the
facts
concerning
the
awards
of
a
pension
or
benefit
or
as
to
statistical
type
information.
so
what
congress
and
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
that
the
senate
report,
the
final
senate
report
reaches
precisely
the
same
conclusion.
the
senate
report
indicates
that
while
highly
personal
health
welfare
or
selective
service
records
would
be
generally
non-available,
factual
matters
for
example
reward
again
of
a
pension
or
benefit
should
be
disclosed.
now,
under
the
government's
per
se
approach
here
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
would
admit
that
much
hard
showing
would
be
required
to
a
medical
file
but
by
the
same
token,
there
could
be
valuable
statistical
or
factional
information
in
medical
files
which
could
and
should
be
disclosed
and
that
disclosure
would
involve
no
invasion
of
personal
privacy
and
is
certainly
would
not
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
a
clearly
unwarranted
one.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
suppose
for
example
someone
was
interested
in
the
geographical
radius
from
which
people
came
to
a
particular
public
health
service
hospital.
now
that
is
a
medical
file.
that
is
information
which
i
think
could
and
should
be
disclosed
and
would
not
compromise
anyone’s
personnel
privacy.
and
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
1974
amendments,
congress
squarely
recognized
not
to
a
kind
of
a
situation
and
said
we
do
not
intend
the
per
se
exemption
for
any
of
these
sub-sections
under
b
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
we
want
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
under
the
government’s
approach,
once
it
is
labeled
medical
file,
you
cannot
get
in
it
regardless
of
whether
it
cannot
be
disclosed
regardless
of
whether
is
considered
confidential
or
not.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
think,
i
might
have
some
problems
with
divulging
that
cadet
john
smith
had
mumps
at
age
12
but
it
might
be
very
useful
to
know
that
5%
of
the
cadets
at
the
academy
never
had
mumps
or
information
of
that
type.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
no,
we
do
not.
but
let
me.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
direct
your
honor's
attention
to
the
privacy
act
of
1974
which
specifically
says
that
statistical
and
factual
information
can
be
disclosed
from
personnel
files,
once
written
assurances
are
given
that
the
information
is
to
be
used
for
scientific
scholarly
purposes
and
after
identifying
names
and
references
are
dealt.
so
here
we
have
congress
in
1974
looking
at
a
problem
which
i
suggest
was
quite
similar
to
the
one
which
we
are
facing
and
they
said
let
us
let
this
factual
information
be
made
available.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
these
sanitized
case
summaries
are
neutral
information.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well
that
is
possible
but
your
honor
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
analysis
that
the
district
court
can
and
sure
undertake
in
connection
with
its
in
camera
review
and
they
can
ask
those
some
questions
and
sit
down
with
the
academy
and
see
if
those
associations
could
be
made
and
on
the
facts
that
you
just
put
to
me
that
is
likely
to
be
the
kind
of
summary
that
will
not
be
disclosed.
but
we
are
talking
about
whether
a
cadet
was
asked
to
resign
for
cribbing
in
1957.
that
is
the
kind
of
summary
from
which
those
associations
would
be
for
all
intents
and
purposes
impractical.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
case
presents
any
particular
burden
or
any
particular
complexity
in
that
regard,
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
1974
amendments
add
a
segregable
records
provision
and
in
camera
review
provision
which
provides
in
camera
review
with
respect
to
all
provides
that
a
district
court
may
conduct
such
a
review
with
respect
to
all
the
exemptions
and
in
addition
it
says
that
when
you
have
segregable
records
or
disclosable
records
mixed
with
none
disclosed
for
ones
or
non
disclosable
portions
of
the
records,
they
should
be
looked
at
in
the
essentially
factual
or
produce
some
more
materials
that
should
be
disclosed.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir
and
that
is
what
congress
said
and
authorized.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
no,
i
was
not
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
amendments.
i
was
talking
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
as
it
was
initially
passed.
congress
said
that
essentially,
statistical
or
factual
information
in
personnel
files
could
be
disclosed.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
on
that,
i
believe.

--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
emphasized
the
file
such
as
those
maintained
by
hew
and
the
veterans
administration
which
are
essentially
personal
in
nature
and
legislative
history
of
exemption
6
indicates
that
when
congress
decided
that
essentially
factual
information
could
be
disclosable
from
files
that
had
precisely
those
files
in
mind
and
we
cite
this
history
in
our
brief.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes
sir
i
believe
we
do.
in
any
event,
it
is
a
5(a)(a)
--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
this
case
pertains
exclusively
to
the
air
force
academy.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
all
of
the
service
academies
have
a
toleration
clause
but
the
other
elements
are
essentially
the
same.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
no,
the
study
involved
all
of
the
service
academy.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
the
record
herein
–-
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
finally
like
to
suggest
that
under
the
procedures
set
forth
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
no
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy
is
likely
to
occur.
now
as
we
said,
we
requested
these
files
with
all
names
as
well
as
all
other
identifying
references
deleted.
the
district
court
initially
held
that
the
disclosure
of
these
files
would
involve
no
clearly
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
petitioners
had
not
proved
the
exemption
applied
to
the
summaries
and
remanded
to
case
for
an
in
camera
inspection.
if
the
summaries
could
be
successfully
redacted
or
sanitized
then
they
are
to
be
produced.
if
they
could
not
be
or
the
to
the
extent
they
could
not
be
then
they
were
not
required
to
be
produced,
and
i
would
like
to
finally
emphasize
that
this
procedure
as
authorized
by
the
second
circuit
is
fully
consistent
with
the
act
and
with
its
amendments
and
it
forecloses
any
reasonable
possibility
that
there
would
be
an
invasion
of
the
personal
privacy.
