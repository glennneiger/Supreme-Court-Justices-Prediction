unknown
speaker
are
there
proceedings
that
are
transcribed?
unknown
speaker
at
that
stage
mr.
friedman,
is
there
any
file
or
some
kind
collected?
unknown
speaker
what
goes
into
the
file?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
a
difference
when
the
result
is
guilt
as
against
either
innocence
or
with
discretion?
unknown
speaker
prepared
by
whom,
the
recorder?
unknown
speaker
how
do
i
get
40
copies
one
for
each
of
the
40
squadrons?
unknown
speaker
and
does
each
have
its
own
bulletin
board?
unknown
speaker
and
so
what
then
are
distributed
throughout
the
academy
are
40
copies?
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
posted
for
how
long?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
happens
to
them?
unknown
speaker
and
this
suit
was
to
gain
access
to
the
master
file?
unknown
speaker
but
with
the
names
included?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
law
should
be
in
camera
proceedings
to
see
if
there
should
be
further
reduction.
unknown
speaker
and
eliminate
other
identifiable
material
in
camera
proceeding
conducted
by
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
may
i
get
back
to
justice,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
for
sure
all
40
copies
at
the
end
of
the
school
year
of
each
of
these
summaries
is
collected
and
destroyed?
unknown
speaker
are
the
cadets
not
committed
in
some
way
to
keep
knowledge
of
these
things
to
themselves
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
two
officers
in
the
air
force
academy?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
how
many
cadets
are
there
at
the
air
force
academy?
unknown
speaker
and
do
i
understand
that
all
4200
would
know
the
name
and
circumstances
of
an
honor
code
violation
where
the
individual
is
found
guilty?
unknown
speaker
so
they
are
4200
people
who
know
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
does
the
honor
code
purport
to
impose
an
oath
of
confidentiality
forever
on
graduates
of
the
academy?
unknown
speaker
since
i
have
uninterrupted
you,
did
the
military
say
they
still
have
things
called
201
files?
unknown
speaker
will
this
summary
be
contained
in
an
individual’s
201
file,
if
he
happens
not
to
have
been
found
guilty
but
said
in
one
of
these
discretionary
cases?
unknown
speaker
that
may
not
be
important
but
that
were
similar?
unknown
speaker
well
that
may
be
important.
unknown
speaker
the
committee
report
from
which
you
read
was
on
a
predecessor
bill,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
are
you
arguing
that
these
summaries
without
more
or
personal
files?
unknown
speaker
and
then
alternatively,
that
if
they
are
not,
in
any
way,
they
are
similar
files?
unknown
speaker
because
that
implies
that
personnel
files,
they
are
files,
the
discloser
of
which
would
constitute
clearly
unwarranted
invasion?
unknown
speaker
you
read
this
really
personnel
or
medical
files
and
similar
files
to
disclose
which
also
would
constitute
those?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
but
that
sounds
a
little
bit
bootstrapy.
how
do
you
define
personnel
file
or
rephrase
it
to
include
this
within
it?
i
mean,
it
is
not
in
a
man’s
201
file
and
if
you
were
to
presumably
go
through
the
man’s
file
entirely,
you
would
not
find
this
in
it?
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
about
civil
service
commission
records
of
adverse
action
proceedings
or
summary
court
martial
proceedings
would
those
all
be
personnel
files
under
your
definition?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
i
am
still
not
clear.
i
understand
there
is
a
central
file
but
where
the
officer
remains
in
the
service,
let
us
say
he
is
on
duty
in
the
european
theater,
there
is
a
personnel
file
there
whatever
its
number
would
be.
will
there
be
a
copy
of
this
summary
in
that?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
do
i
understand
now
that
the
government
no
longer
is
relying
on
exemption
2?
unknown
speaker
is
their
any
concern
that
if
you
continue
to
lose
this
case
as
the
government
has
lost
it
as
for
the
honor
code
system
is
destined
for
destruction?
unknown
speaker
case
abstracts,
mr.
parker
that
is
synonymously
summaries
as
mr.
friedman
has
used
the
word.
unknown
speaker
mr.
parker,
under
auspices?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
auspices,
i
take
it
--
unknown
speaker
all
right.
your
use
of
the
word
auspices
confused
me
a
little
bit
because
in
his
published
--
unknown
speaker
it
does
state,
the
publication
does
not
indicate
adoption
reviews
expressed
herein
by
nyu,
the
new
york
university
school
of
law,
the
new
york
university
law
review
or
its
editors.
unknown
speaker
and
just
so
we
understand
what
the
word
auspices
mean.
unknown
speaker
the
complainants
are
not
officers
of
the
law
review
presently
are
they?
unknown
speaker
is
mr.
pedowitz
still
a
party?
unknown
speaker
is
mr.
pedowitz
still
a
party?
unknown
speaker
is
their
any
question
of
mootness
in
this
case?
nobody
has
mentioned
it
in
the
briefs
that
i
saw
but
you
just
said
that,
it
certainly
suggest
there
might
be?
unknown
speaker
but
the
study
has
been
published,
has
it
not?
unknown
speaker
without
obviously,
any
reliance
on
these
documents.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
standing.
i
am
talking
about
mootness.
unknown
speaker
mootness
not
standing.
these
requests
were
made
for
the
purpose
of
the
study,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
you
continue
to
walk
the
information
i
take
it
that
is
sufficient
to
give
you
a
stand
to
go
into
court
under
the
freedom
of
information
act?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
an
allegation
anywhere
that
you
continue
to
want
it
after
the
study
was
completed?
unknown
speaker
but
then
there
is
a
term
unwarranted.
it
indicates
that
they
thought
they
were
some
kinds
of
intrusions
that
would
be
warranted
and
some
that
would
not
be
warranted.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wonder
mr.
parker
might
that
6(b)
interpreted
as
implying
that
there
is
an
invasion
to
personal
property.
so
congress
found
on
the
disclosure
about
personnel
and
medical
or
other
similar
file?
and
there
has
got
to
be
some
justification
for
that
invasion.
congress
already
has
determined
that
disclosure
would
involve
an
invasion.
is
that
not
warranted
perhaps?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
congress
did
not
make
that
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
the
way
--
unknown
speaker
any
cadet
or
just
those
involved
with
the
--
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
is
not
so,
does
that
change
your
case?
let
us
assume
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
suggests,
let
us
assume
that
they
are
not
available.
unknown
speaker
yes.
assume
that
they
are
not
available
generally.
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
not
available
to
general
public
when
they
are
posted
either,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
or
even
the
cadets
generally?
unknown
speaker
are
they
posted
at
areas
where
members
of
the
general
public
visiting
the
academy
could
read
them?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
personnel
action,
is
it
not
whether
he
is
cleared
or
whether
he
is
not
cleared?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
mr.
parker
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
fact
that
these
summaries,
abstracts
are
posted
on
40
bulletin
boards
to
be
seen
by
4200
cadets
in
and
of
itself
takes
it
necessarily
outside
the
reach
of
six?
unknown
speaker
just
the
fact
that
is
such
a
broad
distribution.
unknown
speaker
could
i
interrupt
you
mr.
parker?
unknown
speaker
where
would
you
draw
the
line
as
to
medical
files
putting
personnel
files
aside?
where
would
you
draw
the
line
on
the
medical
side
as
to
what
is
warranted
and
unwarranted?
unknown
speaker
for
example?
unknown
speaker
in
a
medical
file?
unknown
speaker
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
geographical
information
like
that
had
there
has
never
been
regarded
as
confidential
even
though
it
is
part
of
a
medical
file.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i
want
to
know
just
how
far
you
go
or
does
the
fact
that
cadet
might
have
had
mumps
in
his
childhood,
is
this
capable
of
being
divulge
under
exemption
6?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
at
least
under
that
provision
that
some
files
are
admittedly
a
personnel
file,
and
that
you
would
concede
that
a
personnel
file,
nevertheless,
it
could
be
submitted
to
judge
and
take
through
with
anything
in
the
personnel
file,
would
not
necessarily
be
the
privacy
could
be
disclosed?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
even
if
prior
to
that
provision
the
personnel
file
was
not
disclosed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
in
the
very
opposite
and
very
exemptive
stage,
they
should
be
able
to
take
through
an
admitted
personnel
files?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
that
the
materials
would
not
invade
any
privacy
in
the
view
of
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
even
with
respect
to
a
medical
file?
unknown
speaker
and
i
assume
your
point
has
to
be
good
with
respect
to
medical
files
too?
unknown
speaker
mr.
parker,
does
this
record
in
any
way
relate
to
the
honor
codes
in
the
other
service
academies?
unknown
speaker
that
indicate
the
three
systems
are
the
same.
i
do
not
know
this.
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
parker,
i
gather
your
study
involved
here,
involves
only
the
air
force
academy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
parker,
my
understanding
is
that
an
officer
who
has
been
found
guilty
by
the
honor
board
may
if
he
elects
have
a
hearing
before
an
officer
review
board
and
thereafter
may
have
an
adversary
hearing
for
court
martial.
are
the
records
of
those
two
hearings,
public?
unknown
speaker
nothing
on
the
record
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry
mr.
friedman,
that
is
page?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
mission
element?
unknown
speaker
mission
element.
oh!
that
is
some
military
phrase
which
i
take
it
means
a
particular
group
that
is
handling
some
kind
of
program
at
the
air
force,
it
might
be
particular
flight
training
or
something
like
that.
now
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
1974
amendments
which
mr.
parker
had
relied
on,
the
government
is
not
surprising
in
this
freedom
of
information
act
cases
takes
a
somewhat
different
view
of
the
effect
of
those
amendments
than
he
does
that
i
will
not
go
into
it
at
any
length.
we
have
discussed
these
amendments
in
a
lengthy
footnote
beginning
on
the
bottom
of
page
14
of
our
brief
and
we
do
not
think
that
these
1974
amendments
override
the
specific
exemptions.
we
do
not
think
if
these
particular
files
were
exempt,
that
under
the
1974
amendments,
congress
now
intended
people
to
search
through
them
and
decide
what
parts
are
disclosable
and
what
parts
are
not.
in
fact,
the
history
shows
that
this
was
intended
to
be
procedural
in
nature
and
merely
to
reflect
the
existing
case
law
and
if
i
may
just
say
one
more
thing
in
close
–-
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
the
amendments
change
no
rule
of
law
at
all?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
disclosability
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
friedman,
i
do
not
see
how
the
government
could
really
object
that
if
a
district
court
looked
at
the
personnel
file
and
said
this
is
the
kind
of
information
has
just
been
put
in
here
to
conceal
it
and
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
information
that
was
normally
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
look
at
these
summaries
and
say
they
are
not
a
personnel
file?
they
are
not
in
the
personnel
file.
they
are
kept
somewhere
else
and
they
say
these
are
not
a
personal
file
because
for
all
sorts
of
reason.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
part
of
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
they
go
that
far
but
i
would
think,
a
fortiori,
they
would
say
they
could
examine
it
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
personnel
file?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
recall
it.
unknown
speaker
in
the
red
brief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
