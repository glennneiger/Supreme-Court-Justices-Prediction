chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-489.
mr.
friedman,
would
you
prefer
to
defer
your
beginning
until
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
will
begin
at
1
oâ€™clock
and
open
with
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman
you
may
proceed
on
489.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
in
your
view,
does
that
term
unwarranted
invasion
mean
that
there
is
a
balancing
process
that
is
to
balance
the
importance
of
the
disclosure
to
the
person
asking
for
it
against
the
potential
for
injury
to
the
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
legislative
history
shed
any
light?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
cadet
for
example
from
taking
it
off
the
bulletin
board
in
making
39
xerox
copies
other
than
the
honor
code
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
time
of
his
graduation
on
his
assignment,
would
it
be
available
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
record
that
would
shed
light
on
that
so
that
those
omitted
from
the
conventional
personnel
file
for
reasons
of
protecting
the
confidentiality
in
extra
measure,
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
mr.
parker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
mr.
parker,
does
the
term
unwarranted
modifying
either
intrusion
or
some
were
to
that
effect
require
a
balancing
process
as
i
inquired
with
mr.
friedman
so
as
to
measure
the
reasons
for
which
the
information
is
sought
or
has
been
suggested.
is
everyone
who
makes
an
inquiry
on
exactly
the
same
footing
no
matter
what
his
purpose
may
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
not
mean
they
are
available
in
public?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
not
term
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
agree
it
was
somewhat
ambiguous,
but
is
that
not
to
be
read
as
meaning,
it
is
not
available
to
the
general
public.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
indication
on
the
record
that
anyone
outside
has
ever
had
access
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
looking
to
governmental
practices
in
general
mr.
parker,
in
the
department
of
interior
and
department
of
justice
or
anywhere
else
where
you
have
a
personnel
file
presumably
on
every
employee,
and
there
is
limited
access
to
that
personnel
file
of
course
as
we
know.
if
the
employee
was
cited
by
a
superior
and
subjected
to
certain
charges
and
administrative
hearings
were
held
and
that
was
washed
out
and
he
was
cleared,
would
that
not
go
into
her
personnel
file?
i
am
speaking
now
of
general
practices
in
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
one
agency
whether
say
the
department
of
interior,
to
ask
for
access
to
personnel
file
of
an
employee,
a
lawyer
in
the
department
of
justice,
i
take
it,
you
are
familiar
that
that
is
a
common
governmental
practice.
and
the
reason
might
well
be
that
the
department
of
interior
is
thinking
about
hiring
this
man
on
their
own
staff,
if
they
certainly
would
make
an
evaluation
of
any
adverse
charges
or
adverse
disciplinary
actions
would
they
not
take
that
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
me,
it
is
pretty
difficult
to
separate
charges
of
this
kind
from
personnel
records
and
personnel
files.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
not
know
whether
they
would
refuse
to
give
that
information
in
the
context
of
this
case,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
neutral
information
though
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
do
not
know
that
yet
of
course.
now,
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
a
charge
came
in
that
a
cadet
who
was
a
member
of
the
football
squad
had
accepted
bribe
in
connection
with
the
game
and
it
was
sufficiently
documented
so
that
it
figured
an
inquiry.
and
then
the
inquiry
was
held
over
period
of
time,
i
would
assume,
it
could
take
time.
and
he
is
totally
cleared.
now
then
if
that
had
occurred
during
the
proposed
season,
it
might
well
be
that
the
player
would
be
put
on
the
bench
during
that
period.
even
if
you
sanitized
as
you
put
it,
if
you
sanitize
that
report
could
not
a
sophisticated
sports
writer
noticing
that
this
man
was
out
of
three
successive
games
for
no
specifically
announced
reason,
put
together
that
the
sanitized
file
meant
that
the
particular
player
was
the
man
accused
to
taking
the
bribe?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
district
judges
are
going
to
get
into
that
exercises
that
you
described,
they
are
liable
to
have
a
good
many
litigated
cases
waiting
their
turn
while
they
are
bruising
these
files.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
parker.
you
have
about
three
minutes,
two
minutes
left
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
extended
both
of
your
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
court
found
that
it
was
not
a
personnel
file
and
the
judgment
have
a
further
step
would
he
not
determine
whether
it
was
a
similar
file?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
weighing
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-489,
department
of
the
air
force
against
rose,
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
