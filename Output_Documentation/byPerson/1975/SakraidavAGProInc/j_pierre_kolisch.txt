mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
pierre
kolisch
and
i
represent
the
patentees
and
very
simply
my
client's
invention
is
for
solving
the
problem
of
non
toilet
trained
cows.
the
prior
art
which
my
brother
tatum
has
talked
about,
particularly
the
mccornack
and
the
bogert
patents.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes
i
certainly
do
mr.
justice
stevens
and
as
you
know
there
is
a
completely
different
principle
under
which
the
ordinary
toilet
works.
well
the
ordinary
toilet
you
have
a
bowl
and
then
you
have
a
pipe
that
comes
down
and
bends
around
and
that
pipe
comes
up
to
approximately
the
level
of
the
water
in
the
toilet
and
that
pipe
always
remains
full
of
water,
acts
as
a
blockage
or
trap
for
any
surge
and
when
you
add
more
water
simply
put
more
water
in
whether
by
bucket
or
otherwise
then
there
is
sufficient
pressure
and
it
just
pushes
down
and
it
empties
out
the
pipe
that
comes
up.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
well,
i
think
that
any
cleaning
whether
it's
by
hose
or
whether
it's
by
bucket
or
in
any
way,
everyone
has
been
trying
to
get
rid
of
cow
manure
in
barns
for
about
thousands
of
years.
i
can't
tell
you
how
long,
and
we
know
i
think
this
is
a
good
place
to
start.
we're
considering
a
patent
here,
which
is
made
up
admittedly
of
a
combination
of
mechanical
elements.
and
whenever
we
deal
with
a
patent
of
that
type
there
are
number
of
semantic
and
ideological
pitfalls
which
the
courts
i
believe
have
had
trouble
wrestling
with.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
one
way
of
approaching
this
patent
and
perhaps
avoiding
some
of
this
pitfalls
is
to
consider
first,
what
these
two
inventors
did
and
then
how
they
did
it.
the
record
establishes
that
the
best
way
of
cleaning
dairy
barn
floors,
up
until
the
time
of
this
invention
was
by
the
use
of
power.
now,
power
i
mean
the
use
of
a
power
driven
blade,
a
front
end
loader
which
would
get
all
the
manure
together
in
pile
and
then
the
manure
would
be
removed
to
some
place
and
ultimately
the
manure
had
to
taken
and
placed
on
the
field
of
surrounding.
now
in
order
to
do
proper
clean
up
job,
that
type
of
a
scraping
operation
had
to
be
followed
by
a
hosing
operation.
the
necessity
for
the
hosing
operation
was
and
we're
talking
about
commercial
dairies,
we're
talking
about
dairies
where
there
are
hundreds
of
cows
involved,
is
that
when
you
scrape
a
floor
which
has
been
covered
with
manure
you
leave
a
thin
slippery
fill
and
this
is
exceedingly
dangerous
to
the
cows
as
well
as
to
anybody
who's
walking
on
it
so
you
have
to
follow
up
this
scraping
operation
with
a
hosing
operation.
now,
once
you've
done
that,
you
then
have
to
get
rid
of
it
and
still
you
haven't
solved
the
problem.
now
you
could
of
course
start
by
hosing
and
that
sometimes
is
done
but
that
won't
work
on
300
foot
alley
way,
because
once
you
start
hosing
i
think
as
any
of
you
know,
you
are
starting
to
splash
things
all
over
the
place
and
besides
that
all
that
you
do
by
a
hosing
operation
is
to
force
it
into
piles
and
in
the
end
even
your
hose
is
not
going
to
dislodge
these
piles.
so
what
did
these
two
inventors
do?
they
came
along
and
they
solved
the
problem
and
the
record
shows
that
to
clean
up
a
comfortable
alley
way,
three
or
four
hundred
feet
long,
would
take
4
or
5
hours.
literally
in
one
minute,
according
to
the
patented
invention,
just
as
long
as
it
takes
to
wave
my
hand,
you've
cleaned.
now
what
you've
done
is
you
have
substituted
for
hours
of
disagreeable
miserable
layer,
a
shining
clean
floor
that
takes
no
time,
no
effort,
no
money
and
satisfies
all
of
the
sanitary
requirements
plus
being
ecologically
extremely
sound
because
what
you've
done
according
to
the
system
is
you
put
the
manure
in
a
form
so
that
it
can
be
put
through
it,
sprinklers
system
and
put
on
the
surrounding
fields.
now
what
i
have
described
is
precisely
what
gribble
and
bennett
invented.
this
is
what
they
contributed
to
the
dairy
industry.
now,
let
me
pick
up
where
my
brother
tatum
did,
with
respect
to
these
two
prior
art
effects
and
these
were
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
record
before
the
district
court,
it
is
undisputed
that
they
are
properly
before
this
court.
i
think
exemplify
the
best
of
the
prior
art.
they
show
that
the
technology
was
to
install
pipes
all
over
a
dairy.
now
the
mccornack
patent
is
extremely
detailed
complicated
piece
of
equipment
but
basically,
what
he
showed
was
that
there
are
partitions
between
the
cows
during
their
milking
area,
they
refer
here
to
cow
shields
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
i
think
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
supplemental
record
on
page
62
figure
14,
yes,
i'm
sorry,
supplemental
appendix
page
62
figure
14
at
the
bottom,
you
will
see
a
cow
standing
and
to
the
left
you
will
see
a
number
215.
that
is
a
stand
pipe
that
bends
over
the
shield
number
40
which
is
around
the
flanks
of
the
cow
and
as
mr.
mccornack
describes,
there
is
offal
that
goes
on
that
and
how
is
that
washed
off.
he
has
water
running
out
of
pipe
215,
that's
one
his
washing
means.
now,
if
we
will
turn
to
page
66
of
the
same
volume,
you
will
see
a
plan
view,
this
is
figure
25
and
there
the
number
265
indicates
a
series
of
pipes
which
go
into
gutters
and
those
gutters
are
shown
where
the
arrows
are,
there
are
group
of
arrows
and
those
are
gutters
and
there
is
water
running
in
those
gutters
from
a
series
of
pipes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
265
appears
in
the
lower
left
hand
corner
just
above
260.
those
are
pipes
and
again
we
do
not
dispute
that
if
the
cows
are
careful
enough
to
drop
their
offal
in
the
gutter,
it
will
be
removed
i
think.
but
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no,
it
talks
in
the
patent
that
there
maybe
used,
they're
maybe
necessary
to
use
hand
cleaning
also
because
this
does
not
cover
all
the
barn
floors
area.
it
is
simply
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no,
i
think
that
under
the
mccornack
patent,
those
portions
of
where
the
water
is
discharged
in
the
gutters
and
on
the
shield
that
supposedly
they
would
be
cleaned.
however,
it
is
not
the
same
concept
as
the
invention.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
difference
in
the
concept
is
the
difference
between
taking
a
hose
and
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
mccornack
hose
–-
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
oh,
yes.
it's
water
under
pressure.
it's
a
series
of
pipes
whether
it
all
comes
from
water
under
pressure.
they're
just
pipes
that
are
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
well
–-
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
they
are
permanent
to
that
extent
a
hose
is
maybe
movable,
but
if
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
they
are
permanently
fixed
pipes
which
are
discharge
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
well,
it's
a
difference
in
the
way
in
which
the
water
acts
once
it
is
released,
whether
it's
a
pipe
or
a
hose
the
water
comes
out
in
the
form
of
the
orifice
from
which
it
has
been
discharged
and
it
is
a
point
in
impingement
and
it
must
be
whether
it
comes
from
a
pipe.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
invention
eliminates
all
hoses,
pipes,
and
gutters.
they
simply
aren't
in
the
invention.
no
such
thing
as
hoses,
pipes,
and
gutters
all
of
which
are
in
the
prior
art
and
unnecessary
in
the
prior
art
same
thing
in
the
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
appreciate
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
it
is
more
than
that.
it
is
the
way
in
which
it's
done.
it's
the
difference
between
releasing
a
tidal
wave
or
a
flood
and
having
water
come
out
of
a
pipe
or
a
hose.
now,
in
both
cases
there's
water.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes,
but
many
pipes
simultaneously
you
simply
have
perhaps
this
type
of
effect,
a
spray
in
effect,
but
it
is
not
hydraulically.
it
does
not
operate
in
the
same
way
at
all
because
the
pipe
discharge
water
simply
cannot
do
the
job
which
the
flood
release
water.
i
think
a
good
example
is
shown
in
the
bogert
patent
which
was
another
one,
i
think
if
you
look
at
page
75,
you'll
see
a
top
plan
view.
page
75,
you
see
cow
stalls
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
and
these
are
indicated
at
5
and
6.
then,
behind
each
of
the
cows
there
is
a
gutter,
number
12
and
number
13.
in
between
those
gutters,
there
is
a
cow
walkway.
the
lines
which
you
see,
dotted
lines
in
there,
are
embedded
underground
pipes
which
run
under
the
cow
walkway
and
then,
discharge
at
the
plurality
of
places
into
the
gutters
12
and
13.
the
water
for
those
pipes
comes
from
a
large
tank
and
that's
shown
on
page
77
at
figure
7.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes,
i'm
talking
about
bogert
now
because
it's
still
the
same
principle
as
mccornack
and
i
think
these
are
illustrative
of
the
prior
art.
figure
7
on
page
77
of
the
supplemental
record
--
i'm
sorry,
supplemental
appendix,
shows
the
large
tank
and
there
are
pipe
connections
which
come
in
and
they
are
shown
at
the
bottom
with
numbers
17,
18,
19,
20,
and
21
and
the
water
simply
runs
out
from
these
pipes
under
pressure
and
it
is
fed
into
the
gutter
at
various
places.
now,
the
problem
for
instance
with
bogert
and
all
the
other
and
that's
why
i
started
somewhat
fatuously
in
saying
that
the
invention
had
to
do
with
cows,
who
were
not
toilet
or
gutter
trained.
bogert
i
will
assume
it
works
perfectly
well
as
long
as
the
cows
remain
positioned
over
the
gutters,
but
as
we
all
know,
cows
don't
remain
that
way
and
when
the
cows
roam,
walk
up
and
down
this
broad
alley
way
which
is
marked
nine
there
is
many
way
of
cleaning
them,
there
isn't
any
provision,
there
isn't
any
suggestion
as
to
how
to
get
rid
of
that.
and
that
of
course,
was
the
ingenious
of
this
invention.
for
the
first
time,
it
was
a
dairy
man
was
unable
to
wash
all
of
his
floor
areas
immediately
without
the
use
of
any
labor,
without
the
use
of
any
power.
here,
was
a
situation
where
you
could
get
rid
of
all
of
the
problems
and
all
of
the
help
that
you
had
in
connection
with
the
removal
of
--.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
all
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
when
the
cows
are
not
in
their
stalls,
it
is
the
cows
in
these
commercial
dairies,
do
not
go
out
to
the
surrounding
shields.
they
are
maintained
in
a
confined
area
where
they
are
milked
and
then
they
go
from
their
milking
they
go
to
a
loafing
area
and
then
they
return
to
their
stalls.
and
a
cow
is
a
marvelous
creature
of
habit
and
it
will
return
to
its
own
stall
and
each
cow
has
its
own
stall.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
cow
can
be
in
any
place.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no,
i
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
he
maybe,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no,
he
won't.
[laughter]
that
is
one
of
the
beauties
of
the
invention.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
now,
what
we
have
in
these
pictures?
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
well,
that
is
the
before
picture.
the
picture
at
the
top
is
the
before.
now,
we
have
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
that
is
after.
now,
what
we
have
in
these
pictures
that
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
cow
maybe
in
its
stall
or
it
could
be
standing
in
the
alley
way.
all
it
does
it
wash
its
feet.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
cows
are
quite
happy
to
have
their
feet
washed.
it
removes
the
offal
and
you
look
at
me
quizzically
and
i
don't
blame
you.
i
didn't
believe
that
would
work
either.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
this
thing
was
first
presented
to
me,
i
said
it
is
incredible.
i
just
do
not
think
it
will
work
first
of
all.
how
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
there
is
no
pressure.
the
water
just
is
permitted
to
run.
that
is
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
well,
what
you
see
these
waves
are
coming
out
is
the
--.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
well,
there
is
--
because
you
have
about
two
and
a
half
feet
of
water
and
then
you
drop.
okay.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
that
is
right
and
if
you
will
look,
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
if
you
will
look
at
the
movies,
i
think
the
in
the
movies
you
see
cows
actually
standing
when
this
water
is
running.
now
i
have
the
same
incredulous
feeling
that
you
did
when
i
was
presented
with
this
invention
and
it
wasn't
until
i
went
out
to
a
dairy
and
saw
a
300
foot
out.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
didn't
think
that
was
possible.
[laughter]
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
drop
is
about
one
foot
per
hundred,
one
or
two
feet
per
hundred.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no,
actually
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
water
moves
swiftly
as
you
can
see
but
it
is
not
such
as
to
not
an
animal,
a
four-footed
animal.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes,
it
is
combining
that
with
the
other
aspect
and
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
“where
are
the
cows
when
this
is
going
on?”
well,
the
one
thing
you
don't
want
to
wash
is
their
bedding.
it's
where
the
cows
are
loafing
and
you
will
see
from
this
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
cows
go
there
normally
to
be
milked.
these
cows
live
in
this
type
of
a
routine.
they
have
a
stall
where
they
lie
down
and
chew
their
cud.
when
their
milking
time
comes,
they
will
get
up
naturally
and
they
know,
these
are
creatures
of
habit,
they
are
milked
twice
a
day
and
they
will
walk
and
amble
around
to
where
the
milking
is
to
take
place
and
then
they
will
go
to
another
area
which
is
called
the
loafing
area
where
they
may
stay
and
then
they
will
come
back
again
to
their
stalls
to
be
fed
because
there
is
food
provided
for
them.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
because
of
the
position,
the
stalls
and
it
is
called
for
in
the
claims
that
the
stall
is
of
a
size
so
that
only
the
front
portions
of
the
cow
can
and
will
be
in.
the
rear
portions
of
the
cow
are
positioned
above
the
alley
way.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question
mr.
justice
blackmun.
in
the
first
place,
in
these
commercial
diaries,
they
have
the
same
type
of
cows.
they
all
have
holsteins
or
jerseys
or
whatever
it
is.
secondly,
the

there
is
a
thing
that
you
can
put
in
front
of
the
cows
and
you
can
push
it
back
or
forth
depending
upon
the
size
of
the

they
can

that
it
will
back

mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
these
photographs
were
added
by
me
because
of
–
they
are
simply
photograph,
i
didn't
know
whether
or
not
the
court
would
look
at
the
movie.
i
felt
that
the
only
possible
way
that
the
court
could
understand
what
this
is
all
about
is
by
looking
at
photographs.
now,
this
is
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
these
are
illustrative
of
counsel's
argument.
they
are
no
different
from
other
photographs
in
the
record.
there
are
plenty
of
photographs
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
both
versions
are
here.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
two
and
a
half
minute
version
came
about
as
follows.
we
had
a
long
version,
plaintiff's
exhibit
nine,
which
was
shown
to
the
district
court.
prior
to
the
argument
on
the
merits
in
the
fifth
circuit,
i
prepared
a
short
two
and
a
half
minute
movie
because
i
decided
that
it
was
–
you
couldn't
give
it,
a
nine
or
ten
minute.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
it
was
a
brand
new
movie.
the
same
thing
is
the
other
one
accepted
was
a
condensation.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
now,
what
happened
with
respect
to
that
movie,
i
petitioned
the
court
to
show
it
and
the
court
said,
“submit
a
copy
of
this
to
counsel
for
the
defendant”
which
i
did.
i
prepared
a
separate
and
identical
copy
of
the
movie,
submitted
it
prior
to
the
argument
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
there
was
no
objection
from
counsel
to
the
showing
of
the
movie
in
the
fifth
circuit.
it
was
shown
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
i
think
it
helped
the
court
materially.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
filed
it
--
prior
to
argument
here,
i
asked
mr.
tatem,
“would
it
be
all
right
if
i
use
this
movie
in
the
supreme
court?”
assuming
that
the
court
would
look
at
it,
mr.
tatem
said,
“it
is
all
right
by
me
but
i
will
have
to
talk
to
mr.
holz,
he
is
senior
counsel
in
this
case.
mr
tatem
called
me
back
later
and
said,
“it
is
okay.”
i
understand
that
since
then,
he
has
changed
his
mind
but
it
the
identical
movie
that
he
has
had
ever
since
1973.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes,
i
submitted
the
motion
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
informed
me
that
this
court
would
not
look
at
a
movie
during
a
session
of
the
court,
that
it
was
against
the
court's
rules
and
he
said,
“you
may
lodge
it
with
me
and
then
you
may
call
it
to
the
court's
attention
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
the
movie,
it
will
do
so
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
certainly,
not.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no
sir,
they
are
not.
they
were
prepared
by
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no.
they
are
simply
in
aid
of
counsel's
argument
there.
in
principle,
they
are
no
different
from
what
existed
before
and
the
purpose
was
visually,
if
you
had
not
looked
or
you
would
not
look
at
the
movie
to
try
and
give
you
some
feel
for
this,
and
what
we
show
here
is
the
before,
the
during
and
literally
it
took
about
a
minute
and
this
is
after.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
my
wife
took
them
and
i
stood
next
door
when
she
took
them.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
a
mixed
question.
i
think
you
must
start
by
making
certain
factual
findings
and
in
the
graham
case,
this
court
went
into
that
quite
carefully
and
i
think
that
the
major
substantive
question
before
the
court
is
the
one
of
obviousness.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
with
this
was
novel,
that
it
was
useful.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
would
say
they
were.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
those
are
the
facts.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
well
–-
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
in
the
end,
it
comes
but
there
are
certain
factual
basis.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
no,
i
think
that
the
ultimate
question
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
the
ultimate
question
is
one
of
law.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes,
i
believe
it
a
law
question.
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
in
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
there
was
really
no
evidence
to
support
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
the
newly
discovered
evidence
which
there
are
good
procedural
as
well
as
substantive
reasons
i
think
for
rejecting
it.
the
first
one
is
the
jurisdictional
question
which
i
have
raised
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
this
is
properly
here
and
that
is
in
my
brief
–
that
is
a
pure
jurisdictional
question.
i
admit
i
raised
it
for
the
first
time
here.
i
didn't
think
about
it
before
but
it
is
jurisdictional
and
the
court
of
course
is
always
interested
in
the
jurisdictional
question.
the
second
one
was
that
the
documents
which
were
introduced
at
the
hearing
on
newly
discovered
evidence
should
have
been
rejected
because
those
documents
were
deliberately
withheld
and
not
shown
to
me.
there
was
a
rule
34
motion
made
to
have
the
defendant
disclose
all
of
his
evidence,
documentary
evidence,
which
he
may
have
on
prior
art
that
would
have
covered
role
view
with
one
and
all
the
rest
that
was
not
disclosed.
thirdly,
with
respect
to
the
mission
dairy
and
to
mr.
meyer's
testimony,
mr.
meyer
and
the
mission
dairy
were
admittedly
the
key
to
all
the
newly
discovered
evidence
because
mr.
meyer
was
the
one
who
knew
about
it
all
and
would
tie
the
whole
thing
together.
there
is
not
any
question
that
the
defendant,
as
well
as
the
attorney
knew
about
the
mission
dairy
in
october
of
1969.
at
that
time,
he
made
a
deliberate
choice.
i
don't
need
the
mission
dairy
to
win
this
case
and
therefore
he
did
not
use
the
evidence.
he
went
through
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
did
not
use
it.
two
years
later,
he
went
through
a
trial
and
he
did
not
use
this
evidence.
after
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
time
reversed
and
said
the
patent
is
invalid,
he
splits
back
and
said
ah
but
i
have
some
newly
discovered
evidence
which
i
want
the
court
to
consider.
the
court
very
generously
i
think
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
under
60(b)(2)
and
there
simply
said,
“oh,
we
are
not
going
to
let
all
the
evidence
in
and
never
pass
the
threshold
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
brought
up
is
this
newly
discovered
evidence
because
there
are
very
strict
requirements
under
60(b)(2).
the
threshold
questions
were
never
satisfied
with
the
answer.
in
fact,
they
would
never
answered
because
under
60(b)(2),
you
have
to
show
one,
it
has
newly
discovered
two,
it
could
not
have
been
discovered
by
due
diligence.
in
this
case,
there
isn't
any
question;
they
knew
about
it
and
it
did
not
take
due
diligence
to
find
out
who
the
owner
of
the
mission
dairy
was
when
he
knew
about
the
mission
dairy.
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
take
a
deposition.
so,
i
think
that
under
any
test
whether
it
is
even
the
juno
test,
that
very
controversial
flash
of
genius
test
which
this
court
handed
down
–-
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
i
do
not
think
it
is
mr.
chief
justice,
but
sometimes
language
from
that
decision
creeps
back
in
and
therefore
i
would
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
he
supposedly
took
--
mr.
j.
pierre
kolisch
yes.
i
think
that
that
legislation
was
enacted
to
dispense
with
it.
i
would
say
this
on
a
philosophical
ideological,
gribble
and
bennett
are
classic
case
of
the
beneficial
effect
that
the
pattern
system
should
have
and
here
with
two
individuals
who
had
nothing
except
some
good
ideas,
hard
work
and
determination.
now
the
potential
of
a
legally
enforceable
right,
they
went
ahead
and
obtained
a
patent.
now,
based
on
this
belief,
they
started
with
a
little
business.
they
had
nothing
and
they
succeeded
in
building
up
a
reputable
business
which
has
received
good
commercial
acceptance.
interestingly
enough,
this
case
has
none
of
the
odes
features
which
some
of
the
cases
before
this
court
involving
patents
may
have
had.
they
made
the
patent
available
to
anybody
practically
for
nothing.
all
that
they
asked
was
that
you
pay
them
a
fee,
a
one
time
fee
of
$1,500
plus
one
dollar
per
cow
and
that
meant
that
anybody
could
get
it.
an
installation
of
300
cows
cost
$250,000
and
the
rent
or
the
charge
would
be
$1,800
once
and
that
is
all.
