justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
one
that's
filled,
the
objective
effect
as
some
of
us
looked
at
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
thought
it
was
in
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel
the
respondent's
brief
says
that
two
and
a
half
minute
film
script
was
shown
to
the
fifth
circuit
at
the
argument
on
the
merits,
so
you
must
have
seen
it
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
did
it
take
them
to
reduce
that
concept
to
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tatum,
even
assuming
that
the
trial
court
was
right
in
finding
that
this
was
newly
discovered
evidence,
it
wasn't
prior
art,
was
it
because
it
wasn't
a
permission,
doesn't
the
record
show
that
mission
dairy
came
into
being
after
the
patentee's
device
was
reduced
to
practice
a
year
before
the
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
there
a
finding
--
isn't
it
undisputed
that
the
mission
idea
was
reduced
to
practice
in
october?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
contend
that
it
was
prior
art
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
–-
justice
john
paul
stevens
filing
of
the
plan
for
this
big
barn
was
a
reduction
to
practice,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
the
practical
problems.
i'm
just
not
sure
i
understand
your
legal
theory.
your
legal
theory
is
that
the
filing
of
the
plan
for
something
that
had
not
yet
been
reduced
to
practice
was
prior
art.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
you
to
be
arguing
that
it
was
not
prior
art
but
nevertheless
there
was
evidence
that
this
was
not
a
very
inventive
concept.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
simultaneously
developed
which
is
a
different
argument,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
all
--
i'm
really
--
what
i
was
suggesting
is
this
is
all
unrelated
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
newly
discovered
evidence,
that's
in
the
record
without
this
edition
start,
is
it
not
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
having
brought
that
analogy
and
i
wonder
if
you
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
common
variety
of
patent
that's
available
to
every
body,
in
stating
the
obviousness
of
this
device.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
mr.
kolisch,
mccornack
i
guess
is
the
name
of
this
patent,
does
this
contemplate
the
use
of
the
flushing
technique
without
prior
cleaning
by
hand,
shoveling
and
oil
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
change
the
question
slightly,
to
the
extent
that
this
device
is
intended
to
flush
portions
of
the
barn,
does
the
device
contemplate
to
those
portions
which
previously
be
cleaned
manually?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
difference
between
concept
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
a
hose?
this
is
--
this
does
not
describe
use
of
hose
–-
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pipe
as
distinguished
from
hoses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
different,
are
they
not?
there
is
a
permanent
installation
through
which
the
water
flows.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
not
hoses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difference
in
concept,
the
different
method
of
getting
the
water
propelled
through
the
gutters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difference
--
is
one
huge
flow
rather
than
several
separate
flows
simultaneously?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
is
the
difference
between
cleaning
everything
at
once
in
cleaning
only
a
portion
of
the
barn
and
also
try
and
articulate
what
the
difference
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
simultaneously?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
say
that
is
the
rule
in
most
courts
of
appeals,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
the
seventh
circuit
it
isn't
the
rule
there;
very
clearly,
it's
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
issue
of
obviousness
is
treated
as
issue
of
law
by
the
courts
of
appeals
generally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
not
what
you
answered
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
asked
you
on
the
issue
of
obviousness
does
rule
52(a)
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
quoted
there
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
second
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit,
did
the
fifth
circuit
include
any
of
the
district
court
findings
on
the
three
parts
of
the
graham
test
were
clearly
erroneous?
