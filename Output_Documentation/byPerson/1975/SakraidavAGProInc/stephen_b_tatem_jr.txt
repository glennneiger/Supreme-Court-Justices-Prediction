mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
stephen
tatem
from
el
paso,
texas
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
has
been
sued
for
violating
united
states
letters
patent
entitled
dairy
establishment.
the
patent
was
filed
on
november
the
5th
of
1963
and
was
finally
issued
on
november
the
14th
of
1965.
it
has
been
admitted
in
this
case
and
so
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
that
every
element
in
this
patent
consisting
of
13
elements
is
old
in
the
art.
in
a
part
of
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
which
has
validated
of
this
patent
on
the
basis
that
it
exhibits
novelty
and
is
not
obvious,
the
court
has
specifically
said
that
while
this
honorable
court
rejected
its
rationale
graham
when
it
validated
a
patent
on
the
basis
that
an
old
result
in
a
cheaper
and
otherwise
more
advantageous
way.
although
the
court
rejected
that
proposition,
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
confessed
that
it
was
ignorant
as
to
what
test,
if
any,
this
court
substituted
or
what
had
struck
out.
it
is
submitted
that
this
case
is
controlled
and
govern
by
the
decisions
in
this
case
written
by
this
court
in
anderson's-black
rock,
graham
versus
john
deere,
a.
&
p.
and
lincoln
engineering.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
setting
aside
the
trail
court
findings
on
three
different
occasions
to
the
affect
that
this
combination
patent
did
not
show
novelty,
none
obviousness
and
that
under
rule
52,
they
are
supported
by
credible
evidence,
were
not
clearly
erroneous
and
they
were
reached
by
proper
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
mr.
justice,
it
is
my
understanding
and
i
confess
that
i
am
not
a
patent
attorney.
this
by
chance
is
the
first
patent
case
that
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
to
be
dealing
with,
but
as
i
understand
that
law
in
this
court's
enactment
in
the
graham
case,
while
the
three
inquiries
that
are
asked
under
section
103
are
considered
factual
inquiries,
a
final
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
patent
is
or
is
not
valid
is
a
question
of
law
to
which
this
court
and
only
this
court
is
the
final
arbiter.
i'm
also
of
the
opinion
that
the
question
of
novelty
would
be
in
that
same
category.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
the
validity
of
a
patent
is
a
question
of
law.
in
making
that
determination
whether
it's
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court
of
necessity
in
reaching
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
non-obvious,
there
are
certain
factual
inquiries
that
lay
the
predicate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
final
decision
in
obvious,
non-obviousness
is
one
of
law.
i
think
that
it
is
relevant
in
understanding
what
is
involved
in
this
particular
patent,
and
the
only
–
the
only
means
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
particular
patent
that
is
allegedly
new
and
outside
the
prior
art
is
the
means
to
house
or
hold
water
at
upper
end
of
a
dairy
barn
in
a
pool
or
on
the
floor
so
that
when
it
–
so
that
it
can
be
released
suddenly
to
flow
downhill
and
as
it
flows
downhill,
the
natural
propensity
of
water
removes
manure
that
is
on
or
on
deposit
on
a
concrete
floor.
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
understand
first,
what
are
the
basic
features
of
what
i
refer
to
as
standard
grade
“a”
dairy
barn
floor
plan
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
is
they
are
fairly
standard.
they
are
regulated
in
order
to
be
able
to
sell
and
produce
grade
“a”
milk,
you
have
to
have
certain
sanitary
conditions
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
that
type
of
production.
first
basic
to
a
modern
dairy
is
the
fact
that
the
floor
is
concrete,
it
is
paved.
it
generally
slopes
downhill
towards
a
drain.
the
reason
for
that
is
to
allow
or
to
assist
water
that
is
on
the
floor
to
be
removed.
the
floor
itself
is
contoured
or
it
is
shaped
to
try
to
avoid
puddles.
there
are
may
or
may
not
be
groves
in
the
concrete.
the
groves
would
allow
or
assist
water
to
remove
manure
that
maybe
deposited
on
the
floor.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well,
mr.
kolisch
has
reproduced
in
a
supplemental
appendix
beginning
on
page
11
his
patent
of
the
supplemental
appendix
which
is
this
one.
now,
the
patent
is
also
in
evidence
and
is
a
part
of
the
single
volume
appendix
although
i
confess
it
is
a
little
harder
to
read
because
it's
small.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
yes.
i
would
just
refer
you
to
the
larger
one
because
it's
easier
at
page
11.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well,
in
all
candor
mr.
justice,
the
two
and
a
half
minute
movie
was
not
in
evidence.
there
is
a
larger
one
–
there
is
a
larger
movie.
i
think
it
was
about
15
or
20
minutes.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
i
think
there
may
be
one
that
is
filed.
there
may
be
one
that
is
filled
but
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
there
was
a
movie
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
that
was
the
one
it
was
introduced
in
the
trial
court
before
judge
gwen
in
el
paso
and
it's
about
15
or
20
minutes.
and
as
i
understand,
the
one
that
has
been
asked
to
be
shown
in
argument
is
an
edited
movie
not
from
the
same
one
and
we
would
object
to
that
being
shown
because
it's
an
attempt
to
supplement
the
record,
or
it
is
not
the
same
movie
that
was
in
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
it
is
from
the
same
movie
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
your
honor
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
no,
i
don't
want
to
disqualify
any
judge.
i
can't
make
a
decision
on
that
because
i
haven't
seen
the
movie
that
you
are
thinking
about.
i
don't
want
you
to
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
if
it's
not
the
same
movie
in
evidence,
that's
right.
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
movie
is
going
to
disqualify
judge
that
has
looked
at
it.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
if
there
is
a
movie
–
if
the
court
wants
to
see
the
one
that
it
was
in
evidence
is
the
15
or
20
minute.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
i
think
it
is.
so
far
as
i
understand
it
that
it
is.
i
was
asked
for
--
specifically
to
have
all
of
the
exhibits
from
the
fifth
circuit
up
here
and
i
was
under
the
impression
that
was
here
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
that
would
be
my
position.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
no
sir,
i
was
not
at
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
it
was
my
understanding
as
long
as
the
matter
has
been
raised
that
the
movie
that
was
offered
to
the
fifth
circuit
was
from
the
same
movie.
we
are
not
sure
now.
it
may
be
but
i
am
saying
that
there
has
been
some
question
raised
about
it
and
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
say
because
i
did
not
see
the
movie.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
all
right
sir.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
all
right
sir.
i
believe,
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
thought
the
fifth
circuit
had
two
movies
there.
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
thought
all
the
exhibits
were
also
before
the
fifth
circuit.
on
top
of
the
floor
are
cow
stalls,
feeding
area,
milking
area,
and
holding
area
and
the
cow
of
necessity
needs
to
walk
from
various
areas
to
the
other
--
on
this
concrete
floor.
also,
in
standard
dairy
barn
is
some
type
of
trough
or
tank
which
holds
the
water.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court,
that
in
the
mid
1960s,
when
the
application
for
this
particular
patent
was
submitted,
and
if
we
look
at
the
definition
of
how
webster
defines
flush,
to
mean
a
sudden
release
or
washout,
sudden
rapid
flow
of
water
to
flood,
it
would
be
most
difficult
to
come
up
with
a
new
idea
that
added
to
the
sum
of
useful
knowledge
with
a
“flush
system”
because
by
definition,
we
are
dealing
with
water
that
must
be
suddenly
released
as
a
rapid
rate
of
flow
to
wash
out,
to
flow
or
to
flood
in
order
to
have
a
flush
system
by
definition.
the
respondent's
expert
mr.
hubert
has
given
us
a
detailed
explanation
of
how
this
flush
concept
works.
it's
in
the
appendix
beginning
at
page
114
through
116,
but
its
basic
concept
is,
that
when
water
begins
to
flow
it
creates
energy
which
serves
as
a
cleaning
action
and
that
the
natural
propensity
of
water
as
it
flows
downhill
is
to
have
the
bottom
of
the
water
on
to
the
floor,
the
top
surface
of
the
water
goes
faster
and
therefore
as
the
water
flows
downhill,
it
has
a
natural
cleaning
action.
the
basic
propensity
of
water
is
generally
related
to
the
amount
of
the
water
released
and
the
slope
or
the
grade
of
the
floor
onto
which
it
is
released.
now,
when
we
get
to
this
point
in
the
record
and
it
was
in
the
record
before
it
is
in
our
briefs,
we
had
cited
this
reference
before,
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
discuss
this
legend
of
hercules.
what
did
he
do?
it
is
recorded,
it
is
only
a
legend
but
it
is
recorded
in
greek
mythology
in
that
as
hercules
as
his
fifth
labor
saw
the
conditions
of
stables,
he
at
a
single
glance
diverted
the
stream
of
alpheus
to
clean
the
stables
of
the
filthy
manure
on
the
floor.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
it
certainly
does.
i
would
cite
the
court
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
until
the
time
of
the
bucket,
because
it
is
submitted
and
again
i
have
to
be
in
all
candor
with
the
court,
it
seems
that
this
tank
is
simply
the
release
of
–
we
are
talking
about
a
tank
that
has
2000
gallons
of
water
and
releasing
2000
gallons
of
water
of
itself
is
going
to
bring
about
some
action
and
we
maintain
that
that
is
not
a
noble
idea,
it
is
not
add
to
the
some
of
the
useful
knowledge,
but
i
do
direct
the
court's
attention
to
some
prior
art
that
is
recorded
and
that
is
set
out
in
some
detail
beginning
on
page
five
of
our
reply
brief.
the
first
of
the
patents
is
the
mccornack
patent
which
again
it
is
much
more
legible
that
if
it
is
looked
in
the
blue
appendix,
it's
much
larger
beginning
on
page
55.
mccornack
patent
by
chance
is
named
dairy
plant.
the
patent
we
are
talking
about
is
dairy
establishment.
the
patent
to
mccornack
was
issued
on
june
1st
of
1937,
but
the
mccornack
patent
deals
with
the
idea
of
trying
to
save
labor
both
as
to
the
milking
and
removal
of
manure
operation
and
for
disposing
of
the
manure
or
slurry
as
a
natural
fertilizer
after
the
operation
is
complete.
mccornack
teaches
that
and
they
also
use
the
word
flush
specifically
in
the
specifications
that
the
milking
benches
and
gutters
are
washed,
the
water
flows
from
the
shoals,
flushes
simultaneously
by
means
of
a
common
valve.
mccornack
teaches
that
what
happens
is
that
the
operator
who
was
located
near
the
rear
of
the
cows
steps
on
a
foot
pedal
in
the
floor
that
releases
the
water
against
the
shoals
which
flows
downhill.
i
also
cite
the
court's
attention
to
the
patent
of
bogert
which
begins
on
page
five
through
seven
of
the
reply
brief.
bogert
specifically
deals
with
an
apparatus
for
cleaning
the
surfaces
of
barns.
its
application
for
patent
was
issued
on
march
the
4th
of
1941.
now,
in
the
bogert,
bogert
refers
to
“a
fluid
cleaning
medium”
which
when
you
read
the
specifications
is
water.
bogert
refers
to
a
“fluid
cleaning
medium
supply
tank”
which
is
attached
on
the
floor
at
the
upper
end
of
this
particular
barn,
which
when
a
‘cap
valve'
and
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
visualization
of
this,
it's
very
similar
to
the
top
of
commode
seat,
it's
on
page
75.
that
is
his
basic
layout
but
be
that
as
it
may,
this
for
your
will
commode
seat
is
picked
up
by
chain
which
causes
the
water
to
be
stored
in
this
“fluid
cleaning
medium
supply
tank”
to
go
downhill
by
gravity
and
then
enter
the
various
gutters.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
specifically
that
in
bogert,
which
is
the
march
4,
1941
patent,
the
cows
were
arranged
so
that
the
manure
of
necessity
fell
into
a
gutter.
it
did
not
flow
onto
the
floor.
so,
therefore,
the
fluid
from
the
fluid
cleaning
medium
supply
tank
only
flushed
the
gutter.
the
patent
in
question
–
the
cows
–
the
manure
is
not
necessarily
deposited
in
such
manner.
in
other
words
it
is
not
accumulated
solely
in
a
gutter.
so
here's
tank
is
water.
i
want
to
refer
the
court
specifically
to
the
language
of
the
patent
office
on
page
13
through
15
of
my
brief.
in
examining
these
prior
art
publications
the
patent
office
said
this,
since
the
patent
in
mccormick
discloses
that
is
old
in
the
art
to
flush
cattle
stalls
and
to
collect
for
fertilizer,
it
is
held
to
be
an
obvious
expedient
under
35103
to
provide
the
(inaudible)
dairy
establishment
with
such
a
flushing
means
and
waste
collection
tank.
on
page
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
the
prior
art
that
i
am
talking
about
is
not
what
the
fifth
circuit
was
talking
about.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
it
has
been
conceded
by
the
respondent
that
it
was
identical
to
their
pact
but
that
we
haven't
--
i
have
not
talked
about
mission
dairy
yet.
maybe
it
is
necessary
at
this
point
in
time
if
i
may
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
alright,
what
i
simply
wanted
to
do
and
it
is
my
position
that
the
record
before
that
was
made
before
judge
gwen
that
went
up
to
the
fifth
circuit
with
respect
to
the
mccormick
and
bogert
patents
as
well
as
the
other
evidence
was
sufficient
for
this
court
to
apply
the
four
supreme
court
cases
i
have
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
let
me
bring
up
what
happened
procedurally.
in
january
of
1973,
my
client,
who
then
was
living
in
florida,
by
chance
was
met
mr.
herbert
meyer
who
happen
to
be
in
florida.
at
that
particular
time
in
january
of
1973
we
had
not
received
the
decision,
the
second
decision
from
the
fifth
circuit.
in
february
in
1973,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
for
the
second
time
this
patent
application,
i
mean
this
patent
case.
we
filed
at
that
time
when
we
had
received
notice
at
the
second
case
had
been
reversed,
a
motion
for
re-hearing
addressed
to
the
fifth
circuit
raising
the
question
that
mr.
sakraida
had
only
three
weeks
before
personally
met
the
name
of
the
man
who
owned
the
mission
dairy
in
gonzalez
california.
it
was
it
that
time
that
the
fifth
circuit
directed
us
since
we
were
the
appellee
to
bring
this
motion
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
because
they
were
the
only
medium
through
which
we
could
act
to
get
a
record,
so
we
did
that.
we
filed
a
motion
pursuant
to
the
direction
of
the
fifth
circuit
with
the
trial
court
in
el
paso.
there
was
a
different
trial
court
that
was
sent
from
san
antonio,
texas
to
el
paso
to
receive
the
testimony
with
respect
to
mr.
herbert
meyer,
mr.
bud
sakraida,
mr.
chester
whitmore,
and
mr.
frank
susa.
those
exhibits
together
with
the
pictures
from
herbert
meyers
dairy
are
also
before
the
court
as
exhibits
a
through
k.
following
that
hearing,
judge
wood,
up
until
that
time
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
also
entered
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
he
found
that
the
patent
lacked
novelty.
it
did
not
meet
the
test
of
obviousness.
it
was
anticipated
by
this
prior
art
and
that
the
petitioner
had
exercised
due
diligence
in
discovering
the
name
of
the
witnesses
because
they
arose
simply
out
of
a
by
chance
meeting
somewhere
in
the
state
of
florida
in
january
of
1973.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
judge
wood's
findings
on
that
very
point
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
--
before,
he
was
the
trial
court
that
accumulated
that
record
and
attended
that
hearing,
appear
in
the
appendix
first
at
page
174
through
175.
second
they
appear
at
the
appendix
at
page
268,
but
he
is
clear
and
he
gave
creeds
to
our
testimony,
that
my
light
is
on,
do
you
want
me
to
--
all
right,
he
gave
credence
to
our
testimony
that
until
this
by
chance
meeting
we
never
identified
anything
with
respect
mission
dairy.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well
--
but
mr.
chief
justice
the
name
of
meyer
is
the
link
to
mission
dairy
because
until
you
find
mr.
meyer,
you
are
not
able
to
ascertain
what
it
was
that
was
in
existence
at
mission
dairy
because
mr.
meyer
held
key
to
that.
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
essentially
to
this
effect.
between
the
date
that
the
summary
judgment
was
granted
and
the
date
of
merits,
my
client
was
living
in
the
state
of
florida,
the
mission
dairy
is
in
the
state
of
california,
the
trial
was
pending
in
el
paso,
texas.
through
rumors
source
unknown,
the
record
is
that
mr.
sakraida,
it
was
through
a
rumor
suggested,
it
was
suggested
the
hand
the
he
go
the
mission
dairy
and
check
out
what
it
was
that
was
there.
since
he
was
living
in
the
state
florida,
he
asked
a
man
sold
milking
equipment,
a
man
identified
as
mr.
wisdom
who
was
living
in
the
state
of
oregon,
that
the
next
time
he
was
down
in
the
area
to
go
by
the
dairy
and
try
to
find
out
what
was
there.
the
testimony
is
that
when
he
went
to
the
mission
dairy,
he
received
a
rebuff
by
the
manager,
a
mr.
dick
ripley.
he
was
not,
he
got
to
the
premises
but
he
was
not
able
to
get
in
and
supposedly
find
out
about
this
flushing
gate
that
they
had.
he
called
client
about
the
rebuff
and
we
did
not
know
anything
more
about
it
than
what
we've
been
informed
about
by
mr.
wisdom?
the
name
of
herbert
meyer
is
an
assumption
that
the
respondent
will
have
us
believe,
was
linked
at
the
same
time
we
went
to
mission
dairy.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
appendix
as
to
where
herbert
meyer
was
when
mr.
wisdom
was
in
california
or
that
we
knew
mr.
meyer's
name
and
the
trial
court
chose
to
believe
us
on
those
facts
and
that
why
that,
findings
to
that
effect
is
so
clear
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
mr.
justice
stevens
the
evidence
with
respect
to
herbert
meyer
is
that
in
january
of
1962
he
had
plans
on
file
with
california
soil
conservation
service
with
respect
to
his
idea.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
as
far
as
milking
operation
it's
our
position
that
the
mission
dairy
though
is
clearly
evidence
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
and
that
was
part
of
the
basis
what
we
were
using
it?
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
we
do
because
i
think
you
--
i
don't
think
–-
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
the
fact
that
the
idea
was
known
and
made
public
a
year
prior
to
the
application
of
this
patent
and
that
is
when
you
go
down
to
the
california
soil
conservation
people
or
the
department
of
the
agriculture
and
file
plans
to
get
approval
as
to
what
you're
going
to
build
or
do,
that
you
have
reduced
in
essence
or
have
publicized.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
i'm
saying
he's
publicizing
his
idea.
obviously
there's
a
time
lapse
between
actually
he
filed
a
plan
and
when
he
actually
got
the
--
you
see
the
problem
was
not
getting
the
dairy
started.
i
mean
he
had
--
some
of
this
was
getting
the
milking
equipment
there,
that
is
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
on
page
14
through
16
of
our
reply
brief
we
have
addressed
that
very
point
with
several
cases,
the
relevancy
of
mission
dairy
as
prior
art
or
evidence
of
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
we're
saying
–
we're
saying
that
it
was
effectively
publicized
at
the
time
he
goes
to
california
and
files
those
plans.
now
that
--
but
that
just
herbert
meyer.
chester
whitmore's
plan
was
written
in
a
hoard's
dairyman
as
early
as
1953.
frank
susa
was
building
dairy
barns
as
early
as
46
and
emile
rody
who
was
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
no,
that
is
really
not
correct
because
herbert
meyer
was
the
key
to
us
of
locating
these
other
three
individuals.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
my
position
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
on
the
record
of
this
sir
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well?
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
the
first
question
seems
to
me
to
be
the
validity
of
the
patent
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
it
is
my
position
that
the
record
is
sufficient
as
it
was
in
the
fifth
circuit
before
we
went
back
to
the
third
hearing
before
judge
wood,
i
do
think
that
this
court
if
it
feels
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
the
validity
of
this
case
it
should
consider
this
case
--
it
should
consider
the
evidence
that
was
offered
before
judge
wood
and
the
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
because
they
have
found
or
they
did
not
consider
--
mr.
stephen
b.
tatem,
jr.
that
is
true,
thank
you
sir.
