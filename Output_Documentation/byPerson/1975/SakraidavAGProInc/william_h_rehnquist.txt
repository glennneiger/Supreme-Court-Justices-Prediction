william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
tatem,
i
don't
know
if
justice
stewart
feels
completely
satisfied
with
your
answer
to
his
question,
but
i
am
anyway
left
with
some
uncertainties.
you
say,
it
is
initially
a
question
of
fact
but
in
the
last
analysis
it's
a
question
of
law.
does
that
mean
only
when
it's
so
clear
that
reasonable
people
couldn't
disagree
or
only
when
it
falls
outside
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
is
it
a
question
of
law
or
is
this
basically
a
question
of
law
initially
rather
than
a
question
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
a
justice
of
the
court
who
had
seen
that
two
or
three
minute
movie
ought
to
disqualify
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
basis
for
your
claim
of
non-obviousness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
diagram
in
the
record
that
the
â€“-
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
about
on
that
diagram
on
page
66
is
265,
i
don't
seem
to
see
it
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
are
just
for
illustrative
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kolisch,
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
state
of
the
law?
is
an
inquiry
onto
whether
there
something
is
inventive
or
something
is
non
obvious
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact?
