which
it
was
that
the
fifth
circuit
saw,
that
is
the
two
and
a
half
minute
abridged
version
or
the
full
version
because
we
should
certainly
have
available
to
us
whatever
the
fifth
circuit
saw
if
we
want
to
look
at
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tatum,
i'm
trying
to
get
something
clear
from
this
opinion.
there
are
some
suggestions
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
that
indicate
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
effect
determined
that
you
have
not
exercised
due
diligence
and
that
this
was
not
really,
newly
discovered
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
you're
being
–
that
you
are
at
least
in
part
penalized
for
that.
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
procedure
fundamentally,
like
yours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whatever
you
want
but
just
be
sure
that
you
give
some
information
about
that
aspect
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
if
i'm
reading
the
right
opinion
on
page
3a
of
the
appendix
has
agreed
to
testify
that,
that
occasion
you
speak
of
was
the
first
time
he
had
full
knowledge
of
these
facts.
however,
this
is
the
important
part,
the
evidence
clearly
establishes
that
prior
to
the
original
trial
sakraida
was
aware
that
mission
dairy
was
using
a
flushing
system
that
was
a
possible
source
of
prior
art.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
sakraida
has
sent
one
of
his
men
over
to
look
at
it
before
the
trial
and
he
reportedly
wasn't
able
to
see
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
this
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
of
appeals
uses
the
term
clearly
establishes
and
they're
referring
to
something
that's
contrary
to
what
the
district
court
found
which
would
at
least
suggest
to
me
that
they're
making
a
determination
clearly
erroneous
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
well
over
–
mr.
kolisch?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
hydraulic
pressure,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
two
and
a
half
foot
drop,
the
length
of
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
not
create
an
enormous
pressure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
fast
--
a
very
fast
trout
stream
–
drop
the
two
feet
and
a
mile
or
more
or
less
and
that
would
be
very
fast
running
water.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
as
was
suggested,
the
very
appearance
of
that
wave
in
this
photograph
shows
that
there
is
a
considerable
hydraulic
pressure
exerted
here
and
that
is
part
of
the
function
of
what
you
claim
is
invention
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-110,
sakraida
against
ag
pro
inc.
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
