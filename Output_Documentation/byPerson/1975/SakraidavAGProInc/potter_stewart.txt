we
did
–
it
was
settled
in
the
federal
courts
generally
that
the
findings
of
novelty
well
non,
utility
well
non,
obviousness
well
non
of
the
district
court
are
subject
to
the
standards
of
rule
52
i.e.
that
there
is
findings
of
fact
not
of
law.
justice

stewart
it's
also
a
movie
i
understand
from
early
release,
knock
it
down
to
a
two
and
a
half
movie
that
the
respondents
at
least
tell
us
we
ought
to
look
at
before
we
try
to

justice
potter

(inaudible)
of
two
and
a
half
minute
version,
maybe
i
misunderstood.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
–
there
was
a
movie
in
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
in
the
record
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
to
the
record
as
an
appendix
goes
to
the
record,
it's
an
abbreviation
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
hope
you
and
your
fellow
counsel
get
this
straight
now
because
i
frankly
have
been
planning
to
look
at
the
movie
because
i
can
often
understand
things
better
that
way
by
contrast
by
looking
at
drawings
and
blueprints.
and
so
if
probably
after
your
argument
you
and
counsel
get
together
either
saying,
“this
is
a
proper
part
of
this
case
or
isn't”
i'd
be
understood
to
knowing
because
i've
been
planning
to
look
at
the
movie.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
have
thought
that
this
possible
--
the
preliminary
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeal
was
correct
in
it's
ruling
on
your
60
(b)
(2)
motion
and
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
then
arguably
the
correct
disposition
on
our
part
would
be
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
that
so
called
newly
discovered
evidence,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
which
it
never
has
done?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
think
that
the
threshold
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals
should
reconsider
this
case
on
all
of
the
evidence
that
you
now
try
to
introduce
instead
of
on
only
part
of
it
because
they
held
that
your
16
(b)
2
motion
was
not
well
taken?
justice
potter
stewart
--
(inaudible)
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
considered
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
your
motion
was
not
well
taken
so
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
considered
it
in
reaching
its
decision
on
the
validity
of
this
patent.
and
if
we
hold
that
your
motion
was
well
taken
then
the
court
of
appeals
should
consider
it
and
in
the
first
instance
it's
as
the
district
court
did.
the
court
of
appeals
then
should
review
on
the
pro
record
and
on
what
the
district
court
considered
which
it
up
to
now
refused
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
a
little
bit
more
by
my
brother
rehnquist's
question
is
our
findings
of
novelty,
utility
and
non-obviousness
or
their
opposites
subject
to
rule
52(a)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
is
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
established
and
accepted
in
the
federal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
what
will
i
do
in
the
last
sense
of
it?
justice

and
deliberately
enacted
