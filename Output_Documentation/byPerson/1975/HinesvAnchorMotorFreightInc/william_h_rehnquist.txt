justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
the
employer
be
penalized
for
the
shortcomings
of
the
union
here,
which
is
your
men’s
agent
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
is
claiming
the
benefit
of
the
arbitration
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
union
did
not
do
a
good
job
at
the
arbitration
procedure?
why
should
that
redound
the
employer’s
disadvantage,
it
was
not
his
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
are
your
not
people
bound
by
the
acts
of
their
own
agents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
the
company
vested
that
in
the
union,
the
union
represents
the
majority
of
the
employees,
the
union
demanded
that
that
be
done—
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was
the
demand
of
the
union
as
the
agent
for
the
employees
that
that
provision
was
put
in
the
contract,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
and
the
company
is
not
your
men’s
agent,
the
union
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
the
employer’s
defense
was
not
failure
to
exhaust,
but
that
you
are
bound
by
the
result
of
the
arbitration
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
those
are
two
quite
different
things,
aren’t
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schwartz,
our
grant
of
certiorari
here
was
limited,
was
it
not?
it
was
limited
to
the—
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
certainly
in
the
question
stated,
as
shown
on
page
four
of
your
brief,
i
do
not
see
where
there
is
anything
raised
about
collusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
see
anything
in
the
question
presented
that
suggests
any
issue
of
collusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
or
do
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
year
was
this
grievance
heard?
justice
rehnquist
well
there
is
the
question
presented
certainly
does
not
put
that
to
this
hour,
--
if
you
have
collusion
between
the
union
and
the
employer,
almost
by
definition
you
have
the
sort
of
fraud
that
would
be
included
in
the
grounds
for
reviewing
arbitration?
