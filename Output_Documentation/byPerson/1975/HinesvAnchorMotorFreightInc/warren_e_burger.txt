fact
that

where
in
your
brief
you

the
concept
of

between
the
employer
and

warren
e.

in
these
terms
that
you
are
now
arguing.

e.

is
there
something
wrong
with
the
idea
of
having
a
friendly
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
union?
chief

you
have
to
show
what

whatever
your
terms
you
ought
to
reply
to

collusion
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
suit
against
the
union
could
go
a
long
ways
to
producing
the
results
you
have
just
described?
chief

them
in
terms

they
asking
for
back
pay
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.

if
the
employer
is
in
