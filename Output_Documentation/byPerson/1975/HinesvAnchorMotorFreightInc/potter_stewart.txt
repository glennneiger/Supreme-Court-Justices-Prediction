justice

they
were
transferred
up
to
lordstown
from
norwell
ohio,
were
they
not?
justice
stewart
and
worked
it
on
the
seniority
and
there
was
continuing
--
justice
stewart
may
i
ask,
mr.
goldfarb,
you
referred
this
as
an
arbitration
award,
perhaps
inaccurately,
it
was
an
award
of
a
joint
grievance
committee,
had
the
committee,
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
had
the
committee
not
been
able
to
decide
the
merits
of
this
grievance,
where
would
the
grievance
have
gone?
justice
stewart
where,what?
justice
stewart
if
there
had
been
no
decision
there?
justice
stewart
that
would
have
been
the
first
truly,
true
arbitration
in
the
technical
sense.
justice
stewart
is
there
a
procedure
for
what
you
have
suggested?
justice
stewart
with
no
limitation,
no
time
limitation?
justice
stewart
mr.
goldfarb,
i
do
not
understand
that
to
be
your
brothers’
submission.
it
is
rather
that
the
damage
to
these
employees
that
resulted
from
the
failure
of
statutory
representation
on
the
part
of
their
agent
was
their
wrongful
discharge.
and
that
only
the
employer
can
repair
that
damage,
because
only
the
employer
can
reinstate
them.
that
is
a
simple
submission
as
i
understand
it.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
collectability?
justice
stewart
if
i
misunderstand
it
but
it
was
my
understanding
of
it.
justice
stewart
the
question
was,
are
you
--
do
you
think
you
are
fairly
paraphrasing
your
brother’s
position
because
i
thought
you
weren’t
as
i
understood.
justice
stewart
because
they
could
not
be
reinstated,
because
the
employer
can
reinstate
them.
justice
stewart
that
is
self
evident,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
not
reinstatement?
justice
stewart
and
it
was
wrongful
discharge
which
was,
of
which
they
complained.
and
the
remedy
for
wrongful
discharge
is
reinstatement.
justice
stewart
well
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
against
all
the
parties,
did
not
it?
justice
stewart
well,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
to
one
and
no
review
is
sought
to
that,
wasn’t
it?
justice
stewart
see,
we
were
without
power
to
do
what
you
have
asked
us
to
do.
justice
stewart
nobody
says
you
are
staying
in
court
just
by
alleging
there
was
a
mistake?
justice
stewart
it
would
be
bad
faith.
