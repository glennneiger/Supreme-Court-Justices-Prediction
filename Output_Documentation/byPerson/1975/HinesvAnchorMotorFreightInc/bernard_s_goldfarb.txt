mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
this
case
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
greater
context
of
labor
management
relations.
we
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
congressional
mandate
to
amicably
settle
disputes
between
employers
and
unions.
we
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
derivative
rights
of
employees
under
labor
agreements,
we
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
unions’
statutory
duty
to
represent
and
we
also
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
employer’s
standpoint
and
what
are
his
rights.
now
in
order
to
correct
any
misapprehensions
that
the
petitioners
have,
no
employer
vests
anything
in
a
union,
particularly
control
of
a
grievance
machinery.
these
are
bargained
for,
negotiated
and
resolved
at
the
bargaining
table,
approved
by
union
membership
in
the
same
agreement
that
establishes
their
wages,
holiday,
vacation
and
pension.
and
it
is
almost
inconceivable
on
how
they
can
accept
the
benefits
of
that
agreement
and
reject
the
grievance
machinery.
in
this
particular
case
the
men
were
accused
of
falsifying
their
expense
sheets
by
turning
in
inflated
motel
receipts
over
and
above
what
they
actually
paid
for
their
lodgings
while
there
were
on
the
road.
affidavits
of
the
motel
clerk
and
the
owner
specifically
stated
that
the
men
requested
these
receipts.
even
in
the
deposition
and
it
is
in
the
record
where
one
witness
recants
and
says
that
he
lied,
he
says
that
this
is
a
normal
practice
of
the
motels
in
the
area
to
give
inflated
receipts
to
drivers
in
order
to
get
business.
but
in
any
event,
the
case
that
went
before
the
grievance
committee,
the
same
type
of
committee
that
was
approved
by
this
court
in
humphrey
versus
moore.
the
same
type
of
committee
that
is
negotiated
and
approved
by
the
membership,
that
committee
had
before
it
the
men
who
were
involved,
the
affidavit
of
the
motel
clerk
and
the
motel
owner,
the
records,
the
receipts
and
the
hearing
took
several
hours
and
all
the
men
had
an
opportunity
to
talk.
and
all
the
issues
of
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
the
motel
clerk
and
the
owner
were
in
issue
before
that
arbitral
body.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
because
the
drivers
denied—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
that
is
right.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
they
had
an
affidavit
of
his.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
because
the
drivers
denied
the
efficacy
of
that
affidavit,
the
driver
said
that
that
motel
clerk
was
not
telling
the
truth
in
that
affidavit.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
and
the
arbitral—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
obviously
the
arbitral
body
accepted
the
affidavit
over
and
above
what
the
driver
said;
the
notarized
affidavit.
so
the
credibility
at
least
from
our
standpoint
was
an
issue.
in
any
event,
after
the
arbitral
body
decided
the
case
in
favor
of
the
company,
a
lawyer
was
hired
who
went
to
batavia,
new
york
and
interviewed
the
motel
owner,
mr.
rapichi.
and
all
his
affidavit
said
that
he
knew
no
more
about
this
case
than
his
brother-in-law
the
motel
clerk,
witness
pegano
said.
and
armed
with
that
affidavit
they
returned
to
the
grievance
committee
and
requested
rehearing.
and
the
grievance
committee
reconvenes,
examines
the
affidavit
of
rapichi
for
purposes
of
rehearing,
and
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
there
really
is
not
any
new
evidence
in
this
case,
and
accordingly
finds
again
for
the
company.
following
this
the
men
go
to
the
labor
board
and
file
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
which
is
rejected,
they
appeal
that
rejection
and
it
is
rejected
again,
and
they
re-appeal
that
and
it
is
rejected
again.
and
in
the
chronology
of
events,
witness
pegano
then
says
to
a
representative
of
anchor,
i
was
not
telling
the
truth.
a
year-and-half
later
after
all
the
arbitration
process
is
exhausted,
he
says
i
was
not
telling
the
truth
in
my
previous
affidavit.
now
according
to
the
petitioners,
at
that
point
they
state
in
their
briefs
that
right
then
and
there
ipso
facto,
the
arbitral
award
is
vitiated,
there
is
no
longer
any
evidence
of
any
dishonesty
and
the
men
should
automatically
be
reinstated.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
these
arbitration
awards
have
some
legal
efficacy—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
it
would
have
gone
to
a
higher
level.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
other
joint
national
grievance
committee
made
up
of
an
equal
number
of
employers
and
union
representatives.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
if
there
had
been
no
decision
there,
it
would
have
gone
to
a
third
arbitral
process
made
up
of
three
people
with
a
neutral
on
the
final
board.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
in
the
technical
sense,
yes.
now—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
our
position
is
that
the
discharges
were
not
wrongful,
that
there
has
been
a
determination
that
they
cannot
conceivably
be
wrongful
at
this
stage
of
the
game.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
misconduct
on
part
of
the
employer,
nobody
has
accused
the
employer.
whatever
they
have
say
about
collusion
was
rejected
in
the
district
court
and
rejected
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
not
even
being
a,
there
is
being
a
suspicion
of
it.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
collusion—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
no
it
is
not
conceded.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
it
is
not
conceded,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
for
the
simple
reason
that
there
are
tow
different
types
of
wrongs.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
correct.
now
there
are
two
distinct
individual
wrongs,
one
arises
out
of
a
breach
of
a
statutory
duty,
the
unfair
representation
and
a
wrongful
discharge
arises
out
of
a
breach
of
contract.
now,
this
is
where
precisely
where
we
are
at.
according
to
the
petitioners,
they
feel
that
if
there
was
an
unfair
representation
charged,
they
automatically
have
the
right
to
re-litigate
the
wrongful
discharge,
we
disagree
with
that,
we
disagree
with
that.
because
if
that
is
true
under
the
present
state
of
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion,
where
an
allegation
of
bad
faith
is
non
amenable
to
summary
judgment,
and
must
be
litigated.
and
what
petitioners
say
if
they
make
that
allegation
they
have
a
right
to
review
the
wrongful,
the
claim
of
wrongful
discharge
that
completely
destroys
the
position
of
this
court
and
the
finality
of
arbitration,
or
in
the
finality
of
any
kind
of
any
kind
of
grievance
machinery.
it
just
would
not
exist,
it
would
be
non-existent
anymore.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
the
vaca
case
is
distinguishable.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
do
not
think
it
does.
vaca
does
not
read
on
this
issue
because
vaca
did
not
have
the
employer
involved.
vaca
did
not
go
to
any
final
arbitration,
vaca
did
not
--
the
heart
of
vaca
does
not
concern
itself
with
finality
of
arbitral
or
grievance
machinery.
and
that
is
what
we
are
really
concerned
with
here?
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
vaca
is
limited
to
exhaustion,
and
plus
the
fact
that
the
union
is
under
no
compulsion
or
duty
to
pursue
a
grievance
to
the
final
stage
of
arbitration.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
that
is
vaca.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
was
pursued
through
the
grievance
machinery
and
a
conclusion
was
arrived
at,
an
untainted
conclusion.
i
want
to
submit
to
this
court
very
briefly.
they
went
back
to
the
grievance
committee
when
they
took
the
statement
of
witness
rapichi,
but
when
witness
pegano
says
that
he
did
not
make
rightful
affidavit
they
do
not
go
back
to
the
grievance
committee.
it
would
seem
to
me
at
that
point
they
should
have
returned
to
the
committee
and
said,
here
we
have
more
new
evidence,
we
would
like
to
get
another
hearing.
they
do
not
do
that
anymore?
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
not
quite.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
merely
by
saying
this
to
you,
that
we
are
under
no
obligation
to
accept
the
second
statement
of
the
witness
to
be
true,
because
--
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
if
that
so
then
we
never
come
to
final
conclusion.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
do
not
believe
so,
because
the
very
issue,
the
very
same
issue
that
they
want
to
litigate
in
the
federal
district
court
is
the
very
same
issue
that
went
before
the
grievance
committee.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
precisely,
we
have
been
concluded.
we
are
all
done
because
if
we
are
not,
and
they
have
a
right
to
take
us
back
on
the
present
state
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
says
you
have
a
right
to
litigate
that,
then
federal
district
courts
become
nothing
but
reviewing
bodies
for
arbitrators—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
correct,
your
honor,
absolutely.
otherwise
it
has
no,
this
machinery
that
we
have
negotiated
have
no
efficacy,
they
are
meaningless
things,
if
allegations
can
cause
them
to
be
reviewed
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
but
that
is
extra
legal,
but
if
that
were
so,
isn’t
there—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
know,
but
isn’t
there
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
grievant
to
go
back
to
the
committee
that
made
the
award
--
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
the
grievant
feels
that
he
was
unjustly
treated
then
he
ought
to
go
back
to
the
committee
that
made
the
award
and
ask
to
be
reheard
or
file
a
petition
to
vacate
their
award,
rather
than
to
have
trial
de
novo
on
the
same
set
of
facts.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
in
1967.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
yes
there
is,
they
followed
it
once;
that
is
for
a
rehearing
on
new
evidence,
there
is
a
procedure.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
there
is
no
time
limitation.
there
was
no
time
limitation
imposed
on
them
the
first
time,
there
would
be
no
time
limitation
imposed
on
them,
the
second
time.
we
wanted
to
submit
that
in
order
to
give
some
stability
to
arbitral
awards
or
grievance
machinery
awards.
that
traditional
grounds
ought
to
be
utilized
for
setting
up
aside
in
the
courts.
fraud,
collusion,
something
that
taints
the
machinery.
and
we
do
not
want
to
be
heartless
either
to
say
that
the
derivative
right
of
the
employee,
if
he
is
not
fairly
represented
that
he
should
not
have
some
right
in
that
machinery
to
say
something
affirmatively
that,
i
do
not
feel,
i
am
being
represented
properly.
so
at
least
the
employers
and
the
committees
are
put
on
notice,
but
i
do
not
think
he
has
the
rights.
with
all
the
rights
he
has
to
sit
back
and
accept
the
benefit
of
a
grievance
machinery,
and
then
when
he
gets
an
unfavorable
decision
to
holler
foul.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
no,
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
do
not
know
of
anything
in
this
labor
agreement—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
well,
i
do
not
know
of
any
situation
where
they
would
be
prevented
from
doing
it.
i
know
noting
in
this
contract
that
would
prevent
an
individual
from;
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
do
invoke
it
by
filling
a
grievance.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
the
union
files
it
with
the
committe.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
do
not
know
of
anything
in
the
contract
that
would
prevent
the
man
to
file
any—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
no,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
know
of
none.
but
let
us
assume
it
was
frustrated,
let
us
assume
the
union
did
not
file
a
grievance
and
there
had
been
no
adjudication
before
a
committee.
now
i
say
we
have
got
a
different
situation,
a
man
is
entitled
that
be
heard
and
tried
on
the
merits—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
precisely.
we
know
where
we
stand,
we
know
what
risk
we
are
exposed
to
and
we
know
that
we
are
taking
a
chance
until
that
man
has
his
grievance
resolved.
but
until
that
happens,
we
should
be
put
on
some
kind
of
notice
that
we
are
going
to
be
exposed
to
some
kind
of
jeopardy.
and
if
that
man
himself
does
not
affirmatively
take
some
action,
we
will
never
know
what
our
liability
is
under
this
contract;
there
is
no
stability,
we
do
not
have
any
ground
rules,
we
do
not
have
any
way
of
relying
on
the
good
faith
collective
bargaining.
now,
i
want
to
talk
just
briefly
about
remedies.
the
petitioners
seem
to
feel
that
if
the
employer
is
not
kept
in
this
case,
for
no
other
reason
whatsoever,
the
men
cannot
get
a
favorable
remedy.
now
that
would
be
a
unique
proposition
to
keep
a
party
in
a
case
because
of
not
liability
but
simply
because
of
collectability.
and
unless
there
is
some
nixes
to
some
wrongdoings,
some
collusion,
some
taint
in
the
machinery
where
there
is
a
legal
basis
for
keeping
the
employer
in
litigation,
collectability
in
and
of
itself
certainly
cannot
be
the
basis
for
keeping
an
employer
in
as
a
party
defendant
to
a
law
suit.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
well,
to
address
myself
to
that
particular—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
perhaps
i
did
not
understand
the
question?
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
think
i
am.
he
said,
if
i
understood
him
correctly
and
i
think
he
takes
the
position
in
his
brief,
that
unless
the
employer
is
kept
in
this
case
without
regard
to
what
happened
before,
the
men
would
be
without
a
remedy.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
correct.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
and
the
bench
addressed
the
question
that
he
could
get
a
remedy
from
the
union.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
but
not
reinstatement,
that
is
correct.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
yes,
but
the
posture
of
this
case
before
this
court
is
that
the
wrongful
discharge
has
been
adjudicated
and
there
is
some
finality.
and
the
way—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
originally
in
their
compliant
they
ask
for
a
back
pay.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
correct.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
union
can
also
satisfy
a
back
pay
award
and
money
damages.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
it
would
not
be
unique
because
it
is
done
on
wrongful
death
cases,
it
is
done
in
all
kinds
of
phases
where
you
have
to
project
earnings
into
the
future.
the
union
in
and
of
itself
could
satisfy
any
kind
of
a
money
claim.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
and
we
say—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
that
is
his
position.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
that
is
the
reading
i
got
of
it,
but
in
any
event
this
case
boils
down
to
a
very
simple
proposition
that
once
there
has
been
an
adjudication
in
the
machinery,
and
the
employer
is
free
from
any
wrong,
he
should
not
be
exposed
to
the
jeopardy
of
going
through
any
kind
of
litigation,
if
the
union
was
guilty
of
unfair
representation.
there
are
two
distinct
--
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
that
is
right.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
what
inherent
evils
there
would
be
in
that
type
of
situation?
how
easy
it
would
be
for
union
to
be
guilty
of
unfair
representation,
and
take
a
chance
on
a
arbitration
decision.
if
they
won,
they
would
be
fine,
if
they
lost
the
union’s
could
holler
foul
that
we
did
not
fairly
represent
this
man
and
we
want
another
trial.
why
should
be
the
employer
be
infected
with
what
the
union
fails
to
do
in
its
statutory
duties.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
no,
this
is
a
case
of
a,
from
our
standpoint
of
first
significance.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
not
in,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
sir.
there
are
not
any
cases
against
me
where
there
has
been
an
arbitration.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
when
there
has
been
exhaustion.
there
are
plenty
of
cases
that
philosophically
discuss
the
question,
like
vaca
does,
assuming
there
was
a
wrongful
discharge
and
a
failure
to
represent
and
then
they
go
out
and
talk
about
apportionment
but
assuming
a
wrongful
discharge,
our
posture
here
today
is
without
the
assumption,
we
are
dealing
with
the
reality
of
an
adjudication.
and
so
as
a
result
we
say
we
have
got
a
case
of
some
significance
here
where
the
court
has
an
opportunity
to
delineate
some
employer
rights.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
that
is
precisely
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
precisely.
and
so
we
would
like
to
submit
this
case
that
we
would
frankly
like
to
see
the
district
court’s
decision
reinstated.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
think
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
review
the
entire
matter.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
right,
because
fraud,
collusion
goes
to
the
very
higher
deals
with
both
parties.
there
is
nothing
unilateral
about
it.
i
think,
if
we
had
a
fraud
situation
here
we
would
have
a
entirely
different
case
--
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
correct,
there
is
not
any
question
about
it.
i
think
if
we
stayed
with
the
traditional
grounds
of
fraud,
collusion
to
upset
the
arbitration
process,
we
would
greatly
strengthen
the
collective
bargaining
positions
of
unions
and
employers
throughout
this
country.
we
would
have
some
certainty,
we
would
have
some
finality
in
our
dealing.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
either
because
that
takes
two,
it
is
bilateral
then.
but
where
one
party
is
innocent,
i
do
not
think
we
should
be
prejudiced.
i
would
go—
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
no.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
no.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
be
no
question
about
it.
i
think
if
both
were
parties
to
any
kind
of
wrong
that
would
taint
the
machinery
there
is
not
a
doubt
in
my
mind
that
there
would
be
no
validity
of
the
arbitral
process.
but
where
there
is
no
taint
to
the
machinery
and
where,
for
example
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
merely
suggested
that
bad
faith
ought
to
be
litigated
and
not
be
handled
by
summary
judgment,
and
vindicated
the
employer's
position
and
gave
finality
to
the
arbitral
process.
i
think
if
this
court
would
return
to
the
status
of
the
district
court,
we
would
avoid
a
multiplicity
of
actions
in
trying
these
cases
before
arbitration
boards,
and
then
trying
them
again
before
labor
boards,
and
then
trying
them
again
before
district
courts.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
i
think
the
present
posture
of
the
case
is
precisely
that.
if
they
have
an
action
against
the
union
for
any
damages
they
may
have
suffered,
regardless
of
what
it
may
be.
mr.
bernard
s.
goldfarb
malpractice,
and
just
as
against
they
would
have
against
anybody
for
any
tort
that
cause
them
many
damage.
we
would
like
to
stand
submitted
in
our
briefs
and
argument.
thank
you.
