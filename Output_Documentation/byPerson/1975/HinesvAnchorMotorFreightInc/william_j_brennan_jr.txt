justice
jr.
but
you
are
not
suggesting
the
rules
between
the
employer
and
the
union
here,
are
you?
justice
jr.
are
you
claiming
that
this
whole
business
was
worked
out
between
the
employer
and
the
union?
justice
jr.
i
though
your
case
was
that,
there
was
a,
you
did
not
get
the
proper
representation
on
that
part
of
the
union,
and
in
that
circumstance
you
cannot
let
the
employer
out
because
this
occasion
against
the
union,
unless
there
has
been
a
wrongful
discharge.
and
in
this
circumstance,
for
the
kind
of
allegations
that
you
have
made
which
was
focused
on
the
union
representation
as
i
understand
it,
not
as
anything
involving
the
employer,
the
employer
is
not
free
on
for
a
lot
of
issues
tried
out
to
rely
on
the
arbitration
provision
whatever
it
may
be.
isn’t
that
what
you
are
claiming?
justice
jr.
well
let
me
understand?
do
we
or
do
we
not
have
a
case
here
where
what
you
are
charging
is
collusion
between
employer
and
union?
justice
jr.
well,
that
maybe
a
very
different
case
for
me
if,
that
would
be
an
easy
one
if
you
were
charging
collusion
between
employer
and
union?
justice
jr.
but
as
i
understood
mr.
goldfarb,
however
the
position
is
that
he
has
no,
these
employees
have
no
cause
of
action
against
the
union
for
failure
to
give
adequate
representation
in
a
discharge
case,
unless
in
fact
there
has
been
wrongful
discharge.
and
that
therefore
you
have
to
keep
the
employer
in
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
wrongful
discharge
before
he
has
any
cause
of
action
at
all
for
failure
to
give
proper
representation
against
the
union.
then
he
goes
on
as
i
understand
it
the
so
he
answered
me
earlier
as
i
understood
him
to
argue,
that
in
this
instance
you
cannot
rely
on
the
arbitration
law
because
that
award
was
not
the
product
of
a
proper
representation
on
the
part
of
the
union.
justice
jr.
i
know
what
you
say
but
that
is
his
position?
justice
jr.
so
as
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
suggesting
to
you
earlier
your
characterization
of
this
position
does
not
seem
quite
accurate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
quite
right
mr.
goldfarb,
in
this
court’s
cases.
way
back
to
the
steelworkers
trilogy
but
very
especial
emphasis
on
the
values
and
labor
relations
of
the
arbitration
procedure.
and
i
expect
that
your
concern
with
this
employer’s
representative
is,
that
those
procedures
may
not
mean
as
much
as
you
used
to
believe
they
did,
if
we
are
going
to
say
that
you
can
interpose
unless
defense
in
circumstances
of
alleged
here.
justice
jr.
no,
i
guess
our
cases
have
always
said
with
that
exception
to
the
finality
of
arbitration?
justice
jr.
but
i
am
sure
it
is
not
beyond
the
realms
of
practicalities
of
employees
who
lose
arbitration
awards,
thereafter
may
find
a
reason
of
saying
that
they
were
not
properly
represented
by
the
union
in
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
jr.
no,
no,
but
isn’t
that
so?
justice
jr.
if
that
so
i
suppose
this
adds
something
so
far
at
least,
that
the
case
that
is
in
uncertainties
is
to
the
finality
of
arbitration
awards?
