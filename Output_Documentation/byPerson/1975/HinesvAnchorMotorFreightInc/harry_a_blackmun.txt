justice
blackmun
if
you
prevail
here,
do
you
think
the
company
has
a
claim
over
against
the
union?
justice
blackmun
incidentally,
has
he
ever
been
prosecuted?
justice
blackmun
have
your
people
ever
filed
any
charges
against
him?
justice
blackmun
why
not?
justice
blackmun
no,
but
it
is
a
crime,
is
it
not?
justice
blackmun
have
you,
what
does
that
answer
state?
justice
blackmun
you
are
the
one
who
were
defrauded,
really?
justice
blackmun
mr.
goldfarb,
i
take
it
then
that
it
is
your
position
that
we
should
not
assume
here
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
that
the
discharges
were
wrongful
and
in
violation
of
the
bargaining
agreement?
justice
blackmun
maybe
that
is
not
the
exact
question
i
asked
is
--
is
it
conceded
today
or
not
that
these
people
were
the
victims
of
a
dishonesty
of
mr.
pegano?
justice
blackmun
not
conceded.
