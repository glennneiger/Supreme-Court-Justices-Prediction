mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
eight
men,
eight
truck
drivers,
discharged
for
dishonesty
of
which
they
were
innocent
shall
be
permanently
deprived
of
their
jobs,
their
livelihoods
and
their
good
names,
because
they
were
afforded
the
form
without
the
substance
of
agreements
proceeding.
that
issue
arises
on
these
facts,
on
june
5th
1967,
eleven
anchor
motor
freight
truck
drivers
were
discharged
for
the
alleged
dishonesty
in
allegedly
turning
in
inflated
motel
receipts
for
reimbursement,
and
that
the
receipts
were
for
more
than
they
actually
paid.
on
that
day,
the
company
showed
its
evidence
to
the
business
agents
for
teamster
local
union
number
377.
that
evidence
which
is
in
the
record
and
in
the
appendix,
consisted
of
the
motel
registration
cards
and
the
correlative
motel
receipts,
the
registration
card
showing
less
paid
than
the
amount
showed
on
the
receipts.
in
addition
the,
company
presented
the
affidavits
of
the
owner
of
the
motel
and
the
clerk
of
the
motel,
attesting
to
these
records
and
to
the
fact
that
the
man
had
been
given
receipts
for
more
than
they
actually
paid.
in
addition,
there
were
some
corroborative
things
in
the
form
of
logs
and
sign-in
sheets,
the
men
did
not
dispute
that
they
had
been
in
batavia
where
their
logs
showed
they
were.
they
did
not
dispute
that
they
had
stayed
at
that
motel,
but
they
vigorously
denied
to
their
union
leadership
that
they
had
paid
any
less
than
the
receipt
that
they
turned
in.
after
meeting
between
union
and
company
officials,
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
the
matter
would
be
referred
to
the
joint
conference
grievance
committee
in
detroit,
that
the
men
would
continue
working
pending
a
decision
on
that.
the
men
went
to
their,
really
a
gasp
at
what
have
happened
to
them,
went
to
the
union
leadership
the
two
business
agents
angelo
and
schwartz
and
said,
what
shall
we
do?
should
we
go
up
there,
should
you
or
we
or
somebody
go
up
there
to
the
motel
and
talk
to
the
clerk
or
the
owner?
should
we
get
a
lawyer?
should
we
do
this,
should
we
do
that?
they
were
advised
no,
do
not
do
anything,
do
not
worry
about
it,
they
cannot
fire
you,
you
are
a
sure
winner,
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about;
do
not
do
anything
we
will
take
care
of
it.
that
is
clear
in
the
record.
so
the
men
headed
that
advice
as
“advice
of
knowing
what
was
going
on”,
track
driver
lingo
i
think,
and
they
did
not
do
anything,
relying
on
the
union
to
do
something.
well
the
union
did
not
do
anything
at
all.
except
go
to
the
grievance
committee
and
assert,
by
raw
assertion,
the
men
did
not
do
it,
they
must
have
been
the
motel
clerk.
no
evidence
to
support
that
argument,
just
raw
argument.
the
men,
a
majority
of
whom
went
to
the
grievance
committee
were
given
the
opportunity
to
state
their
contention
that
they
did
not
do
it.
the
company
presented
all
of
its
evidence,
not
in
substantial
and
the
grievance
was
upheld.
the
men
were
astounded
having
been
assured
that
everything
would
be
alright,
and
they
went
to
their
union
leadership
and
said,
what
do
we
know,
should
we
get
a
lawyer?
and
he
said
you
might
as
well.
so
they
went
and
they
got
a
lawyer,
finally.
the
lawyer
went
to
batavia,
and
he
got
a
statement
a
notarized
interrogation
statement
from
the
motel
owner,
which
said
that
the
motel
owner
had
no
personal
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
amount
actually
paid
and
written
down
that
his
affidavit
had
been
based
entirely
on
the
records
themselves
in
the
word
of
his
clerk
who
was
his
brother-in-law,
but
he
had
no
firsthand
knowledge.
armed
with
this
statement,
the
men
and
their
lawyer
sought
a
rehearing.
they
were
given
the
opportunity
to
appear,
to
ask
for
a
rehearing
and
the
union
agents
presented
this
statement
that
the
lawyer
had
obtained,
the
lawyer
was
not
allowed
to
participate
except
to
be
present,
read
the
statement
of
the
motel
owner
rapichi(ph)
and
the
rehearing
was
denied.
you
do
not
get
a
rehearing
because
that
is
not
new
evidence
that
is
the
same
thing
you
have
argued
the
first
time,
totally
overlooking
the
distinction
between
argument
and
evidence.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well
the
employer
is;
first
of
all
the
employer
is
not
to
be
penalized
if
he
has
ordered
to
reinstate
these
men—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
but—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
employer
should
not
be
permitted
to
take,
to
claim
the
benefit
of
an
arbitration
procedure
result,
which
is
based
on
shoddy
representation,
where
all
of
the
evidence
of
innocence
was
not
presented—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
agent
was
not
selected
by
them.
it
was
foisted
upon
them,
the
contract
negotiated
by
the
company
and
the
union,
vests
exclusive
control
of
the
union.
the
men
had
no
choice
in
that
fact,
and
the
company
have
invested
that
exclusive
control
over
the
grievance
in
the
union
is
in
a
poor
position
to
say,
okay
we
want
to
reap
the
benefits
of
their
abuse.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
for
bargaining
purposes
the
union
is
the
representative
of
the
employees.
nothing
in
the
law
requires
that
the
union
had
exclusive
control
of
the
grievance
proceeding,
i
direct
your
attention
to
footnote
10
of
the
opinion
in
vaca
versus
sipes,
where
it
points
out
that
alternatively
some
contracts
permit
the
employees
to
have
some
control
over
the
processing
of
their
own
grievance,
so
that
the
company
by
its
agreement
vested
that
control
in
the
union
representative.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
we
do
not
know
how
it
was
demanded.
the
company
and
the
union
agreed
to
do
it?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
is
not
a
willing
agent
under
these
circumstances.
the
record
is
replete
with
a
long
history
of
conflict
between
the
men
on
the
one
hand
and
the
union
representatives
and
the
company
on
the
other,
with
a
lot
of
evidence
of
a
very
friendly
relationship
between
the
company
and
these
union
officials.
the
--—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
i
think
according
to
vaca
versus
sipes,
and
czosek
versus
o'mara,
the
company’s
liability
is
for
a
back
pay.
the
union’s
liability
is
for
the
extent
to
which
its
wrongdoing
increased
the
burden
and
expense
of
getting
their
jobs
back
and
collects
it.
now
when
we
talk
about
the
company’s
good
faith,
which
is
an
argument
that
the
company
has
made,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
set
that
in
context.
if
indeed
the
company
is
entitled
to
any
claim
of
good
faith,
and
based
on
the
background
we
would
deny
that,
nevertheless
that
claim
could
only
be
good
up
till
september
of
1968,
as
far
as
the
litigation
of
the
back
pay
claim.
in
september
of
1968,
the
men
having
filed
applications
for
unemployment
compensation,
anchor
defending
them
vigorously
on
the
ground
that
they
were
fired
for
just
cause,
anchor
sent
an
airplane
ticket
to
the
motel
for
mr.
pegano(ph)
to
come
and
testify
in
favor
of
the
company
against
the
men’s
buc
claim.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
he
has
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
i
have
already
been
involved
in
a
tremendous
burden
in
this
case,
it
would
not
be
productive
for
my
people
to
file
charges
against
the
poor
motel
clerk?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
he
submitted
the
three
crimes
in
his
affidavit.
but
it
will
not
advance
the
cause
of
of
my
drivers
to
refer
charges
against
him,
the
company
is
free
to
do
that
if
they
wish.
in
any
rate—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well
the
answer—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
anyone—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
in
that
sense
my
people
were
victims
of
his
misconduct,
but
again
it
produces
no
recompense,
no—the
defendants
aren’t,
i
mean
the
plaintiffs
aren’t
made
whole
by
prosecuting
mr.
pegano?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
usually
it
is,
usually
it
is.
but
i—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well
it
is
not
a
question
of
profit,
it
is
a
question
of
the
primary
concern
here
being
getting
their
jobs
back
and
clearing
their
good
names.
prosecuting
mr.
pegano
would
not
clear
their
good
names?
when
mr.
pegano
came
to
cleveland
or
in
ohio
in
september
of
1968
to
testify
the
buc
hearing,
he
advised
the
company
on
his
own
that
what
he
had
told
them
before
was
a
lie,
that
he
had
pocketed
the
money
and
their
company,
this
was
denounced
to
the
plaintiffs
by
the
way,
the
company
stating
it
is
as
because
he
changed
his
testimony,
he
was
not,
because
he
changed
his
story
he
was
not
required
to
testify,
silently
shipped
him
back
to
batavia.
never
informing
the
plaintiffs
of
this
fact,
never
offering
to
reinstate
them,
never
offering
even
just
to
clear
their
records
so
that
they
could
get
another
job
somewhere
else
and
not
have
to
report
that
they
were
out
of
work
because
of
dishonesty,
so
if
there
was
any
company
good
faith,
it
comes
to
a
starkling,
screeching
halt
in
september
of
1968.
moreover
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
in
albmarle
and
ratorex
(ph)
to
make
it
clear
that
the
good
faith
is
not
a
defense
to
per
se
to
a
back
pay
claim.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no,
i
am
not
proceeding
under
title
vii,
nor
am
i
proceeding
as
in
ratorex
(ph)
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
action.
however,
both
the
albamarle
and
the
ratorex
(ph)
opinions
drew
for
its
reasoning
on
a
very
old
case
cited
--
it
is
in
my
reply
brief,
it
is
wicker
versus
hopeck
(ph)
six
wallace
94
at
99,
relying
on
law
from
a
breach
of
contract
case,
and
so
i
think
that
ratorex
and
albamarle
are
quite
relevant
to
this
situation,
given
the
derivation
of
the
decisions
in
those
cases.
as
i
indicated
there
was
an
extensive,
an
extensive
background
which
if
time
permits
i
will
go
into,
but
it
is
in
the
briefs
and
it
is
not
in
terms
of
the
relationship
of
the
company
and
the
union,
and
the
men
being
now
contest
as
far
as
both
were
concerned.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
correct.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
norwood
drivers
were
particularly
difficult
or
from
the
company’s
standpoint
or
unhappy
from
their
standpoint,
because
they
were
aware
of
the
better
working
conditions
from
their
standpoint
at
norwood,
and
so
they
were
unhappy
at
lordstown,
whereas
the
new
(inaudible)
at
lordstown,
not
having
had
the
better
experience
at
norwood
were
more
complacent
and
for
that
reason,
there
was
some
conflict
there.
and
that
was
the
genesis
of
the
problem
and
there
was
a
wildcat
strike,
in
which
a
number
of
the
plaintiffs
were
very
active,
and
complained
about
lack
of
representation
from
the
union
and
so
forth.
in
any
event,
a
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
cleveland,
in
1972,
the
company
after
discovery
was
completed,
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
motion
was
overruled.
the
case
was
set
for
trial
four
or
five
times
in
the
following
year
but
somehow
never
came
up.
a
year
later
the
company
files
a
virtually
identical
motion
for
summary
judgment,
no
new
evidence,
no
new
law,
same
arguments,
same
contentions.
this
time
the
union
makes
the
same
arguments
too,
the
international
makes
different
arguments,
the
court
revered
itself,
granted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
against
all
defendants.
we
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
with
respect
to
local
377
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
of
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
sufficient
for
us
to
go
to
trial.
but
held
that
not
withstanding
that
fact
and
that
they
may
well
have
prejudiced
the
reliability
of
the
grievance
result,
the
company
was
entitled
for
the
benefit
of
it,
the
men
were
bound
by
it
and
the
dismissal
against
the
company
was
affirmed.
this
was
decided
without
a
great
deal
of
discussion,
without
acknowledgment
of
all
of
the
contrary
authority
around
the
country
and
virtually
every
circuit,
either
by
holding
or
dicta
that
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
entitles
the
plaintiff
to
litigate
his
breach
of
contract
action
against
the
company.
this
flows
from,
and
the
courts
that
have
so
held
do
so
in
large
part
looking
at
vaca.
now
the
rule
that
the
sixth
circuits
sets
up
permits
the
easy
--
facilitates
the
easy
end
run
around
vaca,
you
do
not
have
to
not
process
the
grievance
you
just
do
it
perfunctorily,
you
go
through
the
motions.
and
then
it
is
all
final
and
binding
and
every
thing
is
fine,
makes
no
difference
how
good
the
procedure
or
the
substance
is,
as
long
as
you
go
through
the
motions,
it
is
final
and
binding.
secondly,
this
case
is
really
more
within
vaca
than
it
would
appear
for
the
reason
that
we
are
talking
about
a
joint
grievance
proceeding,
rather
than
an
arbitration.
a
joint
grievance
proceeding
is
a
proceeding
in
which
there
are
an
equal
number
of
union
and
company
representatives.
and
if
the
union
people
vote
for
the
union
people
vote
for
the
union
guy,
and
the
company
people
vote
for
the
company
guy,
it
deadlocks
and
they
go
to
the
next
layer
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
now
what
that
means
is
that
there
is
no
way
that
the
men
can
lose
their
grievance
at
this
stage
without
the
union,
some
union
representatives
voting
against
them.
so
that
is
really
tantamount
to
a
decision
by
the
union
not
to
process
the
grievance
any
further,
similar,
not
identical
but
similar
to
what
the
court
was
discussing
in
vaca
versus
sipes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
between
those
two,
yes
it
is.
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well
vaca
was
a
case
which
went
to
the
third
or
fourth
layer,
when
they
decided
not
to
process
it
any
further.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
the
joint—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
in
czosek,
the
situation
was
one
with
the
railway
adjustment
board,
in
a
situation
where
the
plaintiff
had
a
right
to
press
his
own
grievance,
he
was
not
limited
to
going
for
the
company.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
a
very
different
case,
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
right
that
was
his
defense.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
they
are
two
quite
different
things
but
they
tend
to
merge
when
you
look
at
a
joint
grievance
proceeding
which
is
in
reality
a
decision
by
the
union
not
to
push
the
matter
any
further.
there
is
no
neutral
arbitrator
who
makes
a
decision—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
there
is
some
suggestion
of
that
from
the
beginning,
i
do
not
think,
i
have
to
prove
that
in
order
to
prevail
but—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
i
am
claiming
that
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
of
that.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
is
alleged
in
the
compliant
but
it
is
proved
only
inferentially
and
circumstantially,
there
is
no
direct
evidence
of
that.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
my
basic
fundamental
argument,
but
we
have
also
advanced
the
contention
that
this
did
not
happen
in
a
vacuum,
that
these
--
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
377
representatives
sabotaged
the
grievance
was
because
they
had
a
very
friendly
relationship
in
which
they
were
provided
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
a
secondary
claim,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
the
basic—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
we
have
charged
that.
i
think
that
the
case
is
stronger
in
terms
of
the
evidence,
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
union
in
bad
faith
misrepresented
these
men
because
they
along
with
the
company
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
because
they
were
trouble
makers.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
is
treated
in
the—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
it
is
treated
first
of
all
in
the
statement
of
facts
setting
forth
on
page
eight,
in
very
succinct
form,
the
background
showing
a
friendly
relationship
between
the
union
officials
and
the
company,
a
hostile
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
company
and
the
union
towards
these
men.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes,
your
honor.
when
that
friendly
relationship
includes
the
company
furnishing
the
union
officials
with
cars,
arranging
for
automobile
purchase
bargains
for
them,
hiring
their
relatives,
there
is
something
wrong
with
that.
then
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
in
the
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
one,
can
i
make
two
claims,
your
honor?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
collusion
claim
is
secondary
because
it
is
concededly;
it
is
evidentiarily
not
as
strong
as
i
think
the
other
proposition
is.
it
is
advanced
generally
in
article
iii,
part
iii
of
the
brief
and
part
iv,
dealing
with
the
risks
of
collusion
and
unfair
representation
in
the
joint
grievance
proceeding.
and
all
of
this
is
said
in
the
context
of
the
relationship
between
the
company
and
union.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
to
the
question
stated.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
well,
you
honor,
in
stating
that—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
the
statement
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no.
the
statement
on
its
face
does
not
include
collusion.
it
alludes
to
a
breach
of
fair
representation
with
which
one
looks
at
the
facts
that
underlie
the
breach
of
fair
representation
there
is
a
collusion
argument
there.
but
i
do
not
rest
on
that,
i
do
not
have
to
show
collusion
in
order
to
prevail,
that
is
not
the
basis
of
my
argument.
the
claim
of
the
company
here
is
that,
well
if
you
have
agreed
a
bribe,
it
will
get
you
relief
from
the
union,
they
cause
the
harm
here.
well
relief
against
the
union
is
insufficient,
the
union
cannot
give
them
back
their
jobs,
the
union
cannot
even
clear
their
records
or
give
them
a
good
name
so
they
can
get
another
job
somewhere
else.
at
best
the
union
could—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
can
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
can
never
undo
the
fact
that
they
are
permanently
discharged
from
the
anchor
motor
freight
company
for
dishonesty,
your
honor.
now
anchor
says
it
is
unfair
because
of
its
good
faith.
anchor
discharged
the
plaintiffs;
the
union
did
not
discharge
the
plaintiffs.
anchor
gave
total
control
over
the
grievance
handling
to
the
union,
the
plaintiffs
didn’t
do
that?
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
no
i
do
not,
at
the
time
that,
the
initial
time
the
company
had
prima
facie
evidence
but
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
innocence,
in
fact
in
light
of
the
evidence
subsequently
gathered.
there
is
no
evidence
of
guilt
that
is
left.
the
company
having
discharged
the
men
is
not
and
cannot
be
penalized
by
reinstating
them,
if
as
the
evidence
indicates
the
men
are
innocent
of
the
wrongdoing
with
which
they
were
charged,
then
indeed
the
company
should
be
delighted
to
have
back
eight
highly
experienced,
six
now
two
are
deceased,
six
highly
experienced
truck
drivers
who
have
been
cleared.
but
that
is
not
the
company’s
opinion,
attitude,
and
that
calls
them
to
question
their
handling
of
the
pegano
thing,
calls
into
question
their
good
faith
from
the
very
inception.
their
conduct
with
pegano,
on
the
bureau
of
unemployment
compensation
hearing
was
as
has
been
argued
more
eminent
advocate
recently,
kind
of
the
thirteenth
stroke
of
a
clock
that
calls
into
question
the
first
twelve
strokes,
and
cause
this
question
ab
initio
about
the
company’s
good
faith.
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
would
urge
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
favor
of
anchor
motor
freight
and
remand
the
case
finally
for
a
trial
in
cleveland,
this
is
a
summary
judgment
proceeding
so
far,
and
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes
sir.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
they
have
been
sued
together,
yes.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
not
retried
however,
your
honor,
there
has
never
been
a
trial.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
which
is
the
wrongful
discharged.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
right,
that
is
correct.
i
have
to
make
the
threshold
issue
first
before
we
reach
the
the
wrongful
discharge.
thank
you.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
so
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
the
action
against
the
employer
here
is
a
breach
of
contract
action,
not
a
tort
action,
not
a
criminal
action,
there
is
no
requirement
of
proof
of
mens
rea
or
evil
intent
in
a
breach
of
contract
action.
and
on
that
basis
the
employer
either
breached
the
contract
or
he
did
not
irrespective
of
whether
he
was
in
good
faith
or
not
in
good
faith,
to
say
that
the
discharge
was
not
wrongful
because
it
has
been
adjudicated
in
the
grievance
proceeding,
is
simply
to
pull
himself
up
by
his
own
bootstraps.
that
is
the
very
issue
here
is
how
much
are
we
going
to
attribute
to
this
grievance
proceeding
in
which
grossly
deficient
representation
in
bad
faith
resulted
in
a
total
lack
of
exculpatory
evidence.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
yes
it
was.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
is
only
eight
years
later,
your
honor,
because
of
all
the
proceedings
in
the
courts
below
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
is
eight
years
later.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
except
since
1968
the
company
has
been
on
notice
that
mr.
pegano
has
admitted
to
his
own
wrongdoing
that
the
men
were
innocent.
i
contend
that
to
permit
us
to
proceed
against
the
union
and
the
company
here
will
not
undermine
the
grievance
procedures,
contractual
grievance
procedures
as
this
court
sets
forth
in
the
trilogy.
a
distinction
has
to
be
made
between
cases
such
as
the
trilogy
where
you
have
a
union
against
a
company
whether
or
not
independent
individuals,
where
the
issues
are
such
that
the
union
is
together,
the
company
is
together
and
they
are
litigating
against
each
other.
this
is
a
situation
of
a
third
party.
and
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
in
vaca
dealing
with
the
inherent—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
it
is
not
also
beyond
the
realm
of
--
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
within—
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
except,
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
say
that
the
mere
allegations
of
bad
faith
and
misrepresentation
entitles
us
to
litigate,
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
evidence
of
both
of
those
things.
so
it
is
not
a
free
ticket
into
court,
it
is
a
very
difficult
struggle,
and
if
you
pursue
the
cases
and
law
review
literature
since
vaca
you
will
see
it
is
a
very
uphill
struggle
and
not
one
that
to
be
lightly
undertaken.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
right.
mr.
niki
z.
schwartz
that
is
right.
thank
you.
