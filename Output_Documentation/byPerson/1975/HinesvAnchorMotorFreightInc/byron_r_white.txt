justice
white
i
suppose
it
is
probably
be
possible
to
draw
a
distinction
between
those
cases
where
the
grievances
has
presented
it
all,
and
the
employer’s
defenses
exhaustion
rather
than
preclusion
by
operation
of
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
white
well,
vaca
was
the
former
type,
isn’t
it?
justice
white
they
did
not
go
any
farther?
justice
white
and
the
employer
would
claim
the
failure
to
exhaust?
justice
white
here,
all
the
steps
were
gone
through?
justice
white
—they
were
purportedly
they
were
going
to—
justice
white
and
how
about
czosek?
justice
white
(inaudible)
is
that
still
a
different
--
justice
white
there
is
no
allegation,
that
is
--
it
is
not
alleged
that
in
your
complaint?
justice
white
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
employer
should
be
dismissed
even
if
there
had
been
a
wrongful
discharge?
justice
white
and
because
of
refusing
summary
judgment
against
the
union
left
to
those
issues
in
the
case?
justice
white
alright,
alright.
but
nevertheless
the
court,
if
a
case
comes
to
us,
the
issues
is
whether
the
employer
should
be
dismissed
even
if
he
wrongfully
discharged.
justice
white
what
do
you
do
with
the
vaca
case?
justice
white
--wrong,
but
does
it
not
read
on
this
issue?
justice
white
you
are
saying
that
vaca
is
limited
to
just
the
exhaustion?
justice
white
oh
that
is
vaca
too?
justice
white
that
is
vaca
also—
justice
white
but
you
are
suggesting
that
the
employer
can
say
to
the
employee,
well,
i
fired
you
legally
perhaps
but
even
if
i
did
you
have
no
remedy
because
a
have
contractual
right
to
rely
on
the
grievance
procedure.
and
even
though
the
union
did
not
really
represent
you
well
there,
or
even
though
the
union
will
be
found
to
have
unfairly
represented
you
in
bad
faith,
i
still
have
the
defense
to
the
contract.
justice
white
how
do
you
differ?
justice
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
white
i
know,
but
the
question
is
whether
you
should
stay
in
the
case
until
it
is
decided
whether
or
not
there
was
a
wrongful
discharge?
justice
white
so
you
do
say,
so
you
do
say
yes
even
if
it
is
determined
one
way
or
another
you
have
a
right
to
rely
on
your
contractual—
justice
white
(inaudible)
there
was
a
wrong
discharge
because
it
is
already
been
determined
finally
that
there
was
none?
justice
white
even
though
the
employer
later
said,
well
based
on
this
evidence
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
the
motel
employee
that
pocketed
the
money,
rather
than
the
employees.
the
evidence
shows
it,
here
is
his
bank
account,
here
is
everything
and
here
is
his
confession.
justice
white
--extra
legal.
justice
white
even
though
there
was
a
wrongful
discharge
on
the
actual
facts,
you
have
the
right
to
rely
on
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
white
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
if
the
employee
has
any
access
to
the
machinery
himself?
justice
white
so
that
in
this
case
the
employee
may
not
himself
invoke
these
procedures?
justice
white
is
this
difficult
that
they
may
not
do
that?
justice
white
well
they
filed
a
grievance,
but
let
us
assume
that
the
employer
rejects
it
the
first
level.
now
isn’t
that
the,
only
the
union
that
may—
justice
white
well
isn’t
only
the
union
that
may
do
that?
justice
white
do
you
know
of
any
instance?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
at
least
the
employer
then
knows
there
has
not
been
exhaustion.
justice
white
but
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
statutory
duty,
isn’t
it?
justice
white
and
your
opponent’s
argument
is
that
the
finality
the
attached
to
the
grievance
procedure
should
not
obtain
in
full
force
unless
the
statutory
duty
has
been
satisfied.
that
the
assumption
on
which
finality
is
based
is
that
the
statutory
obligation
has
been
satisfied.
justice
white
are
there
some
cases
that
have
gone
with
you
on
this
matter?
justice
white
there
are
cases
against
you
though?
justice
white
when
there
has
been
exhaustion.
justice
white
what
if
the
arbitrators
decision
itself
was
subject
to
review
on
one
of
the
very
few
grounds
it
is
subject
to,
let
us
say
for
fraud
or
something.
justice
white
even
though
you
had
a
contractual
right
to
rely
on
the
grievance
procedure?
justice
white
it
did
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
hines
case
which
is
here
from
the
sixth
circuit
on
writ
of
certiorari,
the
petitioners
were
discharged
and
their
discharge
was
upheld
by
a
joint
arbitration
committee.
they
then
brought
suit
claiming
breach
of
contract
by
the
employer
and
a
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation
on
part
of
the
union.
the
district
court
gave
summary
judgment
for
both,
the
employer
and
the
union.
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
and
sent
back
for
trial
the
case
against
the
union,
but
affirmed
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employer.
we,
in
turn,
reverse
that
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employer.
under
our
cases,
if
the
employees
--
if
the
discharged
employees,
prevail
against
the
union,
they
will
be
entitled
also
to
a
remedy
against
the
employer.
our
reasons
are
set
out
at
greater
length
in
an
opinion
which
is
on
file
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
stewart,
while
joining
the
opinion,
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
