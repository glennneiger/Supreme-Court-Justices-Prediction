mr.
c.
christopher
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
proper
equal
protection
standards
that
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
this
class
of
illegitimate
children
meets
all
the
traditional
criterion
which
had
been
applied
--
criteria
which
had
been
applied
to
be
pop
this
class
within
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
test.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
dandridge
versus
williams
test
does
not
apply
here
for
the
same
reasons
that
did
not
apply
in
jimenez
case.
the
government
has
made
no
finite
resources
argument
in
this
case.
now,
it
is
not
totally
important
to
us
as
to
what
label
we
put
on
this
case.
is
this
is
a
strict
scrutiny
test
or
it
is
just
a
traditional
test?
at
the
very
least,
we
think
that
it
has
to
be
dealt
with
very
high
scrutiny
and
it
is
not
so
important
as
to
what
we
call
it,
but
it
is
more
important
as
to
what
this
court
does.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
a
strict
scrutiny
and
i
would
contend
under
a
scrutiny,
if
there
is
indeed
abrasion,
we
--
illegitimate
children
are
somewhere
at
the
top
end
of
that
gradient
and
the
difference
would
be
this,
and
people
would
be
placed
along
the
gradient
i
presume,
one
criteria
to
place
upon
that
would
be
are
there
are
class
that
has
no
control
over
the
status
that
they
are
being
discriminated
against
here
and
that
is
the
case
here
in
illegitimate
kid
situation.
but
at
a
very
least
and
it
is
not
necessary
again
to
argue
are
they
in
strict
scrutiny
class
all
the
way
at
the
top
or
are
they
somewhere
approaching
that
class?
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
unless
there
are
first
amendment
overtones,
yes
sir.
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
what
this
court
has
traditionally
done
when
it
has
dealt
with
either
strict
scrutiny
cases
or
heighten
scrutiny
cases
or
whatever
we
might
call
it,
perhaps
sex
falls
under
the
same
category,
generally
speaking,
the
burden
has
been
on
the
government
to
establish
why
or
what
the
legitimate
purposes
of
the
act
are.
that
is
a
very
significant
fact
because
if
the
government
has
to
come
forth
and
say
something,
that
means
a
lot
to
the
outcome
of
the
case.
secondly
and
i
think
perhaps
mr.
jones
has
conceded
this
point,
there
have
to
be
actual
legislative
objectives.
now,
in
this
situation
that
would
be
the
congress
has
actually
have
articulated
in
some
fashion
or
another,
what
indeed
it
did
intent.
it
is
very
easy
for
lawyers
after
the
fact.(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
sometimes
can
we
get
that
right
out
of
the
words
they
use
such
the
word
“dependent?”
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
indeed
you
can,
indeed
you
can
and
if
that
what
is
they
intended
and
if
they
say
with
own
words
that
is
the
place
to
get
it.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
indeed
it
is.
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
that
is
the
best
source,
i
would
guess.
well,
let
me
lead
in
because
that
obviously
leads
into
what
they
did
intent.
the
congress
has
set
up
a
structure
which
is
basically
as
follows.
first
of
all,
everyone
has
to
prove
that
a
individual
was
indeed
a
wage
earner
covered
by
the
act,
employed
for
so
many
months
and
so
forth,
so
many
quarters.
also
they
have
to
apply,
also
they
have
to
be
under
either
eighteen
or
twenty-two-and-half
to
be
unmarried.
those
are
the
non-controversy
or
preconditions
that
have
to
be
met.
there
are
two
major
preconditions
however.
one
is
that
the
paternity
has
to
be
shown
and
the
second
is
that
the
dependency
has
to
be
established.
now,
what
the
act
does
is,
it
sets
up
a
dependency
requirement
and
then
it
wipes
it
away
for
everyone
except
for
two
classes.
one
class
is
a
class
in
this
case,
a
certain
class
of
illegitimate
children.
the
second
class
consists
of
adopted
children
and
stepchildren.
now,
there
is
a
special
reason
for
adopted
children
and
stepchildren
to
have
to
establish
actual
dependency.
indeed,
in
fact,
they
were
dependent
or
supported
by
the
deceased
wage
earners
and
that
is
because
they
have
two
potential
wage
earners
upon
which
to
claim
benefits.
adopted
child
has
its
natural
father
that
he
can
claim
benefits
upon
or
has
a
new
adopted
father.
same
goes
for
stepchildren.
now,
unfortunately,
this
class
of
illegitimate
children
has
been
lumped
in
with
this
latter
category.
unfortunately,
illegitimate
children
much
less
than
having
two
parents
to
look
to
for
support
after
that
parent
dies
or
before
he
dies,
generally,
often
have
no
parents
at
all.
therefore,
it
seems
to
be
good
reason
to
require
adopted
children
and
step
children
to
prove
this,
but
i
contend
that
there
is
no
reason
to
require
this
class
of
illegitimate
children
to
prove
this.
now,
what
the
court
below
and
what
the
secretary
has
argued
the
purposes
is
as
follows:
that
really
the
congress
instructions
the
social
security
act,
intended
to
only
replace
support
that
was
actually
lost,
that
is
the
only
intend
to
give
benefits
to
the
children
of
fathers
who
actually
did
support
them
prior
to
the
father’s
death.
we
cite
in
our
briefs
the
rather
explicit
legislative
history
which
seems
to
counter
this
notion.
there
are
two
documents
that
say
that
the
act
intents
to
give
benefits
to
those
who
did
receive
support
prior
to
their
father’s
death
and
those
who
owe
the
obligation
to
receive
support
prior
to
their
father’s
death.
we
contend
that
that
more
clearly
articulates
congress’s
reasoning,
not
just
to
give
benefits
to
those
who
actually
got
it,
but
also
to
give
benefits
to
those
who
were
in
a
position
that
they
should
have
actually
gotten
it,
but
for
some
reason
their
father
failed
to
live
up
to
that
obligation.
what
the
district
court
below
did
in
order
to
add
on
to
that
reason
is
the
district
court
below
assumed
that
congress
set
up
a
category
that
those
people
will
not
have
to
prove
actual
support
before
the
father
died
if
it
is
more
likely
that
they
indeed
were
supported.
this
is
a
very
similar
to
frontiero
versus
richardson
this
court
has
encountered
before.
in
other
words,
legitimate
children
are
presumed
generally
to
have
been
supported,
therefore,
to
save
administrative
convenience
that
category
will
not
have
to
establish
that
they
were
in
fact
supported.
now,
our
briefs
establish
that
assuming
that
indeed
congress
had
such
a
notion
which
we
do
not
think
they
do
because
the
congressional
history
does
not
seem
to
indicate
that,
but
they
indeed
did
have
that
notion,
the
act
has
very
aptly
attempted
to
pursue
that
purpose.
there
is
no
guarantee.
there
are
only
two
studies
that
seemed
of
reflect
upon
this
and
both
result
an
ambiguous
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
not
who
is
more
likely
than
someone
else
to
have
actually
been
supportive
prior
to
death.
accordingly,
it
seems
highly
likely
that
even
if
we
assume
that
congress
did
indeed
intent
to
only
give
benefits
to
those
people
who
were
actually
supported
prior
the
death,
that
they
did
really
accomplish
that
in
any
meaningful
way.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
okay,
the
social
security
administration,
if
you
are
an
adopted
child
and
you
are
not
an
illegitimate
child
in
this
class
presumes
that
you
were
in
fact
dependent
upon
your
natural
father,
and
you
can
automatically
assume
you
prove
his
is
your
father
get
social
security
benefits
under
the
act.
now,
you
may
also
want
to
attempt
to
get
benefits
under
your
adopted
father’s
wage
earner
status
and
in
effect
you
can
get
the
highest
of
whichever
the
two
maybe.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
you
cannot
get
both.
you
have
the
best
of
both
worlds
whichever
that
maybe
and
we
are
not
complaining
about
that.
the
problem
is
the
act
has
lumped
our
category
in
with
this
category
that
has
two
potential
wage
earner
sources.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
true.
that
is
possibly
true,
but
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
okay,
i
concede
that
that
is
true.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
find
out
the
identity
of
his
own
father?
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
it
is
in
some
circumstances.
i
do
not
really
think
it
is
in
most
circumstances,
your
honor.
the
act
sets
out
various
explicit
routes
by
which
you
can
establish
the
paternity
of
your
natural
father
even
though
he
was
not
married
to
your
mother,
and
indeed
there
are
difficulties
in
pursuing
proof
of
paternity
at
times.
now,
the
act
does
not
seem
to
really
be
dealing
with
that
difficulty.
it
may
be
argued,
the
logical
purpose
of
this
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children
could
be
to
bolster
prove
of
paternity,
and
therefore,
avoid
fraud.
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
purpose.
as
our
brief
indicates,
the
secretary
who
himself
is
the
one
to
whom
you
have
to
prove
to
his
satisfaction
paternity,
his
own
internal
claims
manual
which
is
his
instructions
to
people
as
to
how
to
interpret
the
act,
it
does
not
seem
to
use
as
to
that
purpose.
prevention
of
a
fraud
could
theoretically
be
a
purpose
in
this
situation,
but
congress
has
not
said
it,
the
secretary
has
not
said
it,
the
district
court
did
not
say
it,
and
the
solicitor
general
has
alluded
to
it
in
the
last
two
pages
of
his
brief,
mildly.
if
this
is
a
case
that
requires
some
sort
of
heighten
scrutiny,
it
would
not
seem
that
that
sort
of
a
very
evasive
and
intangible
purpose,
never
articulated
by
congress,
could
indeed
be
the
legitimate
purpose
upon
which
this
case
could
be
--
the
statutory
classification
be
found
constitutionally.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
there
is
a
presumption
of
the
class
that
rev.
norton
is
not
supportive,
was
not
previously
supported
by
the
deceased
father.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
one
way
that
the
act
could
be
read.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
okay.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
here
is
an
example.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
if
you
ascribe
that
intent
to
congress
and
if
congress
indicated
that
finding
by
the
way
it
structured
the
act.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
same
congress
assumed
then
that
these
other
categories
were
more
likely
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
my
contention
is
this.
the
only
notion
that
i
can
see
anyone
having
would
be
based
upon
a
few
very
limited
sources
of
statistical
information.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
assuming
congress
has
made
that
judgment
which
i
of
course
did
not
concede,
i
think
this
court
still
has
a
role.
if
congress
said
--
if
congress
made
an
assumption
which
is
factually
incorrect
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
the
secretary
has
had
the
chance
to
show
you
whatever
basis
congress
might
have
had.
you
have
and
if
--
he
has
had
the
chance,
you
do
not
have
to
ask
him
that.
he
has
all
the
opportunity.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
no,
there
is
evidence
to
indicate
that
they
can
--
it
is
really
not
clear
who
is
more
likely
to
be
a
supporters
than
not.
there
is
evidence
to
indicate
that
there
is
no
ground
for
any
assumption.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
there
is
this
one
study
which
was
done
and
it
is
not
conclusive
says
“that
89%
of
absent
illegitimate
fathers,
we
call
them
that,
do
not
support
their
children,
whereas
81%
or
82%
of
absent
legitimate
fathers
do
not
support
their
children”.
okay,
so
there
is
an
8%
difference
between
these
two
classes
in
this
one
study
which
was
conducted
in
california
and
is
referred
on
the
brief.
my
contention
is
that
8%
does
not
mean
much
and
there
is
really
nothing
upon
which
you
can
basic
conclusion,
a
presumption
such
as
this
and
especially
not
enough
when
you
talking
about
illegitimate
children.
it
maybe
enough
when
you
are
talking
about
minnesota
farmers,
but
it
is
not
enough
when
you
are
talking
about
illegitimate
children.
8%
is
not
enough
to
base
a
presumption
upon.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
that
would
have
done
it
and
problem
is
that
people
who
are
fathers
of
illegitimate
children
do
not
take
to
the
habits
of
writing
letters
and
going
through
the
formalities
that
a
lot
of
middle
class
people
traditionally
do.
so,
as
a
practical
matter
i
wish
that
happened
more
often,
but
it
does
not
happen
and
that
makes
it
more
difficult
for
these
people
to
establish
their
right
to
benefits.
i
see
no
great
difference
between
this
case
and
frontiero
case.
that
was
a
case
which
had
the
same
kind
of
presumption
with
respect
to
service
people
and
did
man
have
to
establish
--
a
mail
service
man
was
presumed
that
his
spouse,
his
wife
was
dependent
upon
him,
he
got
benefits
and
the
opposite
was
the
case
for
women.
if
a
woman
was
a
service
person,
she
had
to
establish
specifically
that
her
spouse
was
dependent
upon
her
in
order
to
get
fringe
benefits
from
the
service.
it
seems
to
be
the
very
same
case
in
that
respect,
and
i
would
request
the
very
same
result
which
was
a
reversal
and
finding
of
unconstitutionality
of
this
statutory
scheme.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
it
is
probably
correct
and
i
think
that
there
are
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
only
reason.
there
is
another
reason
which
is
that
historically
it
was
felt
that
illegitimate
fathers
do
not
want
to
give
benefits
to
bastards
and
i
think
that
was
probably
another
historical
reason.
there
was
a
presumption
--
tested
laws
presumed
that
illegitimate
fathers
do
not
want
their
illegitimate
fathers
do
not
want
their
illegitimate
children
necessarily
to
get
their
money.
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
well,
there
are
three
ways.
they
are
basically
the
various
ways
an
illegitimate
child
can
become
illegible
here.
one
is
to
satisfy
his
own
states
and
tests
his
statute.
in
maryland
for
instance
if
gregory
norton
--
mr.
c.
christopher
brown
indeed
and
in
maryland
for
instance,
all
you
have
to
do
is
openly
--
have
openly
acknowledge
that
someone
is
your
father.
gregory
norton,
sr.
today,
he
died
after
1970,
i
think
could
establish,
satisfy
that
test.
here
are
many
different
tests,
but
it
is
not
impossible
to
prove
paternity.
it
is
difficult
to
prove
paternity
but
not
impossible.
the
secretary
in
his
own,
you
know,
the
instructions
that
he
gives
to
his
workers
specifically
says;
first,
determine
paternity,
and
get
some
factors
that
he
relies
when
determining
that
and
then
secondly,
if
they
have
to
fall
under
this
class
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
supported
by
or
lived
with.
there
is
the
secretary
is
the
one
charged
with
this
duty
in
establishing
paternity
has
indicated
in
no
way
at
all
that
indeed
the
support
or
residence
requirement
is
used
as
another
way
to
bolster
proof
of
paternity.
there
maybe
a
illegitimate
basis
in
another
setting,
but
it
does
not
seem
to
be
so
here.
i
have
no
further
comments
sir.
