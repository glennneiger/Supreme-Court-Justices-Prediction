we
will
hear
next
matthews
against
lucas.
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
magallon
against
maryland
in
this.
now,
your
terminologies
got
me
a
little
bit
confused.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
what
you
are
saying
is
that
they
were
not
to
historically
for
a
such
a
long
period
of
time
subjected
to
a
continuous
pattern
as
the
illegitimate
children
who
could
not
inherit
and
who
could
not
do
a
lot
of
other
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
besides
weisenfell
would
you
suggest
indicate
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
get
that
out
of
the
opinion
or
do
you,
is
that
what
your
surmise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
pretty
good
source,
is
it
not,
the
language
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
given
that
most
states
can
seal
the
identity
of
illegitimate
children,
identity
of
the
father
in
adoption
proceedings,
your
generalization
really
does
not
wash
as
to
illegitimate
children.
it
very
difficult
for
an
illegitimate
child
to
find
out
the
identity
of
the
father
in
most
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brown,
you
seem
to
disparage
somewhat
the
idea
that
the
element
of
fraud
was
present
in
these
cases,
but
for
a
number
of
centuries,
not
year,
centuries,
the
explanation
for
not
allowing
illegitimate
children
to
inherit
from
a
father
was
the
fraud
element,
was
it
not?
is
it
not
part
of
the
history
of
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
probably,
there
is
any
doubt
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
most
of
the
states
who
have
statutes
permitting
the
recognition
of
the
illegitimate
child
in
giving
certain
rights
and
are
not
the
statutes
were
concerned
with
patterned
on
those
statutes,
that
is
the
acknowledgment
in
writing
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
maybe,
that
maybe
by
having
a
written
acknowledgment
from
the
father?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
thing
further
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
just
have
three
minutes
to
do
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
