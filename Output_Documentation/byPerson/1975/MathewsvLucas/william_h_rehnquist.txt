william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
take
the
caroline
products
putting
all
this
as
an
article
of
faith
then?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
do
not
believe
that
it
has
the
stature
of
being
bodily
incorporated
into
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
withdraw
my
question.[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
which
test
i
am
speaking
of,
minimum?
is
magallon
against
maryland
(voice
overlap)
do
you
think
of
as
the
minimal
scrutiny
or
minimal
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
mortgage
holders
out
in
minnesota
in
1935
of
minnesota,
that
blade
versus
minnesota’s
home
of
savings
and
loans.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
definable
and
invidious
terms?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
do
you
mean
by
invidious?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
not
think
that
mortgage
holders
out
in
minnesota
and
35
were
subjected
to
that
same
kind
of
treatment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
were
farmers
with
pitch
forks
on
the
courthouse
doors,
preventing
the
law
from
being
enforced
as
recited
in
the
court's
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
one
of
your
objections
though
to
the
two-tier
test,
you
say
is
the
difficulty
of
deciding
which
tier
is
something
goes
into.
now,
you
are
in
effect
proposing
three
tiers.
would
not
that
just
a
compound
the
difficulty
of
deciding
what
tier
is
something
goes
into?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
mr.
jones.
you
say
that
the
purpose
must
have
been
in
actual
one
on
the
part
of
the
congress
and
that
this
particular
legislation
must
have
furthered
it.
so,
that
we
have
said
in
effect
and
say
“do
we
agree
with
the
legislative
judgment
having
had
this
purpose
in
mind
that
this
particular
section
furthered
that
purpose?”
i
cannot
imagine
a
more
complete
method
of
simply
second
guessing
the
legislature.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
have
that
in
mind,
this
general
purpose
and
an
enacted
this
sort
of
statute
which
in
their
view
furthered
it,
we
would
then
be
seating
here
and
said
given
that
purpose,
we
think
what
you
choose
to
further
it,
did
not
further
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
weight
to
this
with
high
scrutiny
and
strict
scrutiny?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
discrimination
against
catholics.
now,
they
can
become
protestants
tomorrow
presumably
and
change
their
status,
would
you
say
that
is
not
there
for
a
strict
scrutiny?
