how
about
the
presumption
or
the
notion
as
you
call
it
that
the
class
you
are
interested
in
is
normally
not
supported?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
that
congressional
presumption.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
let
us
assume
that.
so
when
you
say
that
there
is
conflicting
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
around
and
believe
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
there
is
no
question
about
what
congress
concluded
the
evidence
showed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
it
did,
assume
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
are
suggesting
as
we
should
disagree
with
congress
because
we
think
we
have
a
better
notion
of
what
the
facts
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
congress
so,
they
have
--
congress
has
come
down
and
made
its
own
judgment
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
our
test
be
we
just
disagree
with
them
or
should
we
ask
is
there
some
basis,
any
basis
in
fact
for
the
congressional
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
i
know,
but
what
you
are
telling
us
now
there
is
quite
of
bit
of
basis
for
congressional
conclusion,
namely
the
facts
are
disputed.
there
a
lot
of
evidence
on
both
sides.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
evidence
to
indicate
that
there
is?
