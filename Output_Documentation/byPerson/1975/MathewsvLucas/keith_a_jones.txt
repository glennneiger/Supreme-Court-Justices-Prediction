mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
one
just
argued,
arises
from
the
secretary’s
denial
of
insurance,
child’s
insurance
benefits,
to
the
illegitimate
children
of
a
deceased
wage
earner,
on
the
ground
that
the
wage
earner
had
not
been
supporting
or
living
with
the
children
at
the
time
of
his
death.
in
this
case,
however,
the
claimants
brought
suit
for
review
only
of
the
secretary’s
specific
denial
of
benefits
to
them.
it
did
not
request
either
injunctive
or
class
relief.
the
district
court
sustained
the
secretary’s
findings
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
but
nevertheless
reversed
without
issuing
injunction,
the
denial
of
benefits
on
the
ground
that
the
statutory
eligibility
requirement
of
support
of
co-residence,
denied
illegitimate
children
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment.
since
in
so
holding,
the
district
court
held
a
statute
of
--
held
an
active
congress
unconstitutional.
this
court
plainly
has
jurisdiction
under
section
1252
of
the
judicial
code.
proper
analysis
of
this
case
requires
a
full
understanding
of
the
statutory
scheme
for
the
distribution
of
child’s
insurance
benefits.
the
formal
linchpin
of
that
scheme
is
dependency.
under
section
202
(d)
(1)
(c)
of
the
social
security
act,
payment
of
child’s
insurance
benefits
are
made
only
on
behalf
of
the
dependent
children
or
disabled,
retired
or
deceased
wage
earners.
however,
the
act
presumes
dependency
as
a
matter
of
law
for
most
children.
as
to
legitimate
children,
the
act
presumes
dependency
if
the
child
is
not
been
adopted
by
another
wage
earner.
dependency
is
also
presumed
with
regard
to
four
categories
of
illegitimate
children.
first,
children
whose
parents
went
through
a
marriage
ceremony
that
was
rendered
invalid
by
non-obviously
legal
impediment.
second,
children
whose
father
had
knowledge
paternity
in
writing.
third,
children
whose
father’s
paternity
was
decreed
by
court
and
fourth,
children
whose
father
was
ordered
by
a
court
to
contribute
to
their
support.
dependency
is
not
presumed
with
regard
to
other
illegitimate
children
or
to
legitimate
children
who
are
illegitimate
adopted
children
seeking
benefits
on
behalf
of
their
natural
parents’
social
security
account.
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
child's
insurance
benefits,
these
latter
categories
of
children
must
prove
that
the
wage
earner
was
in
fact
their
father
and
also
that
their
father
was
living
with
or
contributing
to
their
support
at
the
time
of
death.
now,
it
is
a
constitutional
validity
of
this
statutory
classification
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
appellees
here,
the
lucas
children,
are
children
that
must
prove
dependency
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
child’s
insurance
benefits
under
the
act
and
they
challenge
that
requirement
as
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment.
at
the
out
set
of
this
case,
it
is
necessary
to
address
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standard
of
review,
and
with
the
courts
indulgence,
i
propose
to
approach
this
question
in
a
largely
philosophical
manner.
the
briefs
in
both
this
and
the
preceding
case,
the
norton
case,
proceed
upon
the
premise
that
the
two-tiered
equal
protection
analysis
that
evolved
in
the
late
1960s
still
governs
the
adjudication
of
equal
protection
cases
and
upon
reflection,
i
have
concluded
that
this
premise
is
probably
erroneous.
this
court
appears
in
large
part
too
have
abandoned
the
two-tiered
equal
protection
analysis
and
i
think
for
good
reasons.
the
development
of
a
two-tiered
equal
protection
analysis
appears
to
have
been
an
interim
judicial
response
to
the
perceived
failure
of
the
traditional
rational
basis
test,
sufficiently
to
protect
certain
disadvantaged
groups
and
to
vindicate
certain
important
interests.
and
this
court
determined
that
statutes
adversely
affecting
such
groups
or
impinging
upon
such
interests
would
be
subjected
to
very
close
judicial
scrutiny
and
would
be
sustained
only
if
they
satisfied
or
served
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
compelling
governmental
interest?
no,
but
i
think
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
am
not
sure
of
the
date.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
it
became
one,
i
think.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
other
classifications
continued
to
be
reviewed
under
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
which
required
only
a
minimal
showing
of
rationality.
and
this
two-tiered
approached
had
a
lot
of
obvious
difficulties
to
it.
one
of
these
was
in
knowing
to
which
tier
a
particular
case
belonged.
outside
the
area
of
race,
there
appear
to
be
no
available
constitutional
standards
for
defining
suspectness,
that
is
for
selecting
a
groups
with
respect
to
whom
statutory
classifications
would
be
considered
inherently
suspect.
similarly,
there
are
few,
if
any,
constitutional
guide
posts
for
determining
what
interests
are
so
important
as
to
be
fundamental.
another
difficulty
with
the
two-tier
analysis
is
that
it
is
never
been
easy
to
articulate
an
adequate
constitutional
justification
for
the
dramatic
gap
that
existed
between
the
two
levels
of
equal
protection
review.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
what
sense
an
article
of
faith,
mr.
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
footnote
in
the
caroline
products
case?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
would
be
of
assistance
to
counsel
[laughter].
if
these
cryptic
comments
could
be
made
more
explicit.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
at
any
rate,
with
consideration
such
as
those
i
have
just
indicated
in
mind,
to
perhaps
in
mind,
the
court
has
it
seems
to
me
perceptively
and
gradually
altered
its
approach
to
equal
protection
cases.
first,
in
the
recent
past,
it
has
resisted
attempts
by
litigants
to
add
new
classifications
to
the
suspect
list
of
a
higher
tier.
but
secondly
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
in
many
putatively
lower
tier
cases,
the
court
has
departed
from
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
by
requiring
a
more
persuasive
showing
than
in
the
past;
that
the
means
chosen
by
the
legislature
serve
an
actual
and
permissible
legislative
objective.
in
particular,
this
stronger
showing
has
been
required
for
the
challenged
statutory
classification,
defined
the
class
in
such
a
manner
as
to
create
the
suspicion
that
the
legislature
may
have
been
discriminating
against
it,
against
the
class
without
just
cause.
in
this
latter
development
of
a
stricter
irrational
basis
standard
of
review,
in
large
part
has
rendered
the
two-tier
analysis
obsolete.
accordingly,
i
think
it
is
unrealistic
for
the
appellees
here
to
insist
upon
a
compelling
governmental
interest
standard
of
review.
but
the
same
token
since
this
case
concededly
involves
a
class
of
individuals
that
historically
has
been
subjected
to
social
obliquely
and
to
invidious
treatment
by
state
legislatures.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
equally
unrealistic
for
the
government
to
insist
upon
the
minimal
scrutiny
of
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
anticipate
in
a
case
such
as
this,
the
court
would
carefully
review
the
challenged
statutory
classification.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
magallon
against
maryland
did
not
as
i
recall
involved
discrimination
or
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct,
but
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
minimal
scrutiny
test
is
lost
all
force,
but
rather
i
am
suggesting
that
in
practice,
the
court
has
departed
from
that
test
in
cases
involving
classes
of
individuals
as
to
whom
there
maybe
some
founded
suspicion
that
they
would
be
subject
to
invidious
treatment
by
the
legislature.
a
statutory
classification
that
did
not
classify
people
according
to
any
characteristics
that
would
normally
define
a
class
that
will
be
subject
to
social
mistreatment,
who
would
i
think
the
subject
to
the
traditional
rational
basis
standard
of
review.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
that
kind
of
economic
legislation
which
does
not
impinge
upon
a
group
that
is
definable
and
invidious
terms
would
be
subject
to
minimal
(voice
overlap)
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
frankly
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
the
class
that
were
concern
with
here,
class
of
illegitimate
children,
is
one
that
has
been
subject
to
invidious
treatment
by
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
enactments
that
express
moral
disapproval
of
this
(voice
overlap)
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
not
have
thought
so.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
really
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
simply
to
state
what
i
think
has
become
the
law.
the
--
i
would
have
said
that
discrimination
of
that
kind
is
not
a
discrimination
against
the
historically
disadvantaged
class.
at
the
same
time,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
court
has
started
applying
a
different
rule
than
the
minimal
scrutiny
test
in
some
cases
and
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
just
to
describe
what
i
think
is
practical
matter
that
rule
in
this
case
and
that
rule
i
would
think
be
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
about
a
year
ago,
i
argued
a
case
called
weinberger
against
weisenfell?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
will
not
make
any
comments
as
to
the
outcome,
but
it
seemed
to
me
to
reflect
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
result
was.
it
seemed
to
reflect
the
application
of
a
standard
of
review
that
was
stricter
than
that
of
which
i
had
argued
for
at
the
time.
that
is
stricter
than
the
minimal
scrutiny
that
had
traditionally
had
been
applied
to
socio
economic
legislation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
right.
the
court
did
not
by
terms
required
the
showing
of
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
i
would
hope
that
in
such
cases
the
court
would
not,
and
that
if
they
sufficiently
strong
showing
that
the
congress
had
an
actual
and
legitimate
objective
in
mind
that
can
be
made
then
the
court
would
sustain
it.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
certainly
complicates
matters
for
both
litigants
and
legislatures.
i
think
that
the
two-tier
test
also
complicated
it.
i
am
not
really
proposing
anything,
but
if
i
can
predict
something,
i
would
predict
that
the
court
might
be
tending
toward
the
formulation
of
a
rule
that
might
embrace
a
large
number
of
cases
and
give
more
guidance
to
the
court.
i
think
right
now,
we
are
in
a
position
frankly
where
litigants
and
legislatures
really
do
not
know
just
what
they
can
do
and
maybe
that
will
always
be
the
case
as
long
as
you
have
an
intervention
as
to
approach
the
equal
protection
clause.
but
i
am
recognizing
now
as
we
do
have
such
an
approach
in
this
cases.
at
any
rate,
i
would
anticipate
that
the
court
would
apply
a
test
similar
to
that
that
was
applied
in
weisenfell.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
am
not
saying
mr.
justice
stevens
that
it
should
be.
(voice
overlap)
what
i
am
saying
is
that,
what
i
think
the
law
is
and
what
this
court
is
going
to,
what
i
am
positing
is
a
standard
that
i
think
it
is
likely
this
court
will
used
in
evaluating
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
i
would
assume
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
requirement
that
these
illegitimate
children
prove
dependency
would
be
sustained
if
and
only
if
it
is
shown
that
requirement
furthers
an
actual
and
permissible
legislative
objective
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
denial
of
benefits
to
this
subclass
does
in
fact
serve
an
actual
and
permissible
legislative
objective.
i
would
make
an
important
preliminary
point
at
the
out
set.
this
standard
of
review
rules
out
one
motive
analysis
and
i
think
that
should
be
made
clear.
it
is
not
acceptable
to
ascribe
a
broad
purpose
to
this
statutory
scheme
that
is
in
fact
inconsistent
with
the
challenged
previsions
and
then
to
hold
that
the
provision
is
unconstitutional
because
they
did
not
further
that
purpose.
an
example
of
what
i
have
in
mind
is
contained
in
the
appellant's
brief
in
norton,
where
it
is
argued
that
because
the
social
security
act
is
intended
to
operate
in
a
humanitarian
manner,
it
should
strain
a
court’s
credibility
to
lay
at
congress’s
door
an
intent
to
deny
benefits
to
appellant’s
class.
now,
with
all
due
respect
to
opposing
counsel,
that
line
of
argument
is
simply
nonsense.
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
congress
has
in
fact
expressly
denied
benefits
to
this
class,
and
therefore,
it
cannot
strain
any
court’s
credibility
to
lay
that
intent,
intent
expressly
stated
in
statute
at
congress’s
door.
the
complexity
of
a
legislative
process
requires
a
more
subtle
and
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
statute.
the
question
to
be
asked
in
a
case
like
this,
is
not
whether
the
denial
benefits
to
this
class
furthers
the
broad
social
welfare
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
rather
the
question
that
i
would
anticipate
would
be
asked
is
why
did
congress
chose
to
deny
benefits
to
this
class.
if
congress
had
--
if
congress
reasonably
believed
that
denying
benefits
to
this
class
would
serve
an
actual
and
a
permissible
legislative
objective,
then
i
would
think
the
statute
should
be
sustained.
now,
i
can
concede
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
again
in
weisenfell,
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
that
was
the
requirement
that
congress
was
required
to
spell
out
in
this
legislative
history
what
its
purposes
were
and
than
the
provisions
of
the
statute
had
to
satisfy
those
purposes.
that
had
not
been
the
rule
under
the
traditional
rational
basis
test,
but
that
was
the
approach
that
the
court
took
in
weisenfell
as
i
understood
it.
now,
i
can
conceive
of
three
possible
rationales
for
the
statute.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
if
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
a
lot
of
leeway
has
to
be
given
to
judging
whether
a
classification
in
fact
furthers
the
purpose.
but
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
classification
is
plainly
irrational
in
terms
of
any
perceivable
legislative
purpose,
then,
it
has
been
the
recent
attitude
of
this
court
that
even
if
maybe
some
other
conceivable
purpose
could
have
been
imagined,
nevertheless,
the
statute
will
not
be
upheld,
but
there
are
inevitable
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
the
marie
and
marino
food
stamp
cases
of
three
years
ago
are
similar
examples
where
under
the
minimal
scrutiny
of
the
traditional
rational
basis
test,
i
would
have
thought
that
those
statutory
classifications
could
be
sustained.
but
the
court
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
a
lot
of
this
is
surmised
and
i
forgotten
that.
it
has
been
sometime
since
i
have
read
the
marino
opinion.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
would
be
fine
me
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
would
like
to
make
the
arguments
that
i
think
actually
sustain
this
statute
under
the
approach
that
i
anticipate
would
be
followed
here
and
i
would
say
one
possible
legislature
objective,
i
think,
can
be
eliminated
completely
at
the
out
set
and
that
is
that
congress
did
not
device
the
statutory
schemes
simply
to
invidiously
discriminate
against
the
illegitimates.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
the
statutory
classification
was
motivated
by
congressional
hostility
to
illegitimates.
moreover,
the
extension
of
the
presumption
of
dependency
in
this
case,
the
four
categories
of
illegitimates
and
the
withholding
of
it
from
a
category
of
illegitimate
children
would
refute
i
would
think
any
suggestion
that
the
statutory
pattern
itself
reveals
a
purpose
of
invidious
discrimination.
therefore,
this
is
not
a
case
arguably
like
levy
or
glona,
where
the
legislative
objective
was
the
impermissible
one
of
expressing
moral
disapproval
of
the
state
of
a
legitimacy.
now,
two
other
legislative
objectives
that
i
think
should
be
considered.
one,
clearly
supports
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
other
appears
not
to
do
so,
and
i
will
take
up
these
in
reverse
order
quickly
if
i
can.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
claimant’s
best
argument
here
begins
with
the
contention
that
the
legislative
objective
was
to
restrict
the
payment
of
benefits
to
children
whether
or
not
actually
dependent
who
had
a
legal
right
to
be
supported
by
the
wage
earner.
that
would
be
of
course
permissible
legislative
objective.
although,
the
evidence
is
conflicting,
there
is
some
arguable
basis
for
that
view
in
the
legislative
history.
but
their
argument
perceives
as
i
understand
it
that
the
statutory
scheme
may
have
been
constitutional
at
the
time
of
enactment.
that
the
premise
on
which
it
was
base
was
undone
by
this
court’s
decision
in
gomez
against
perez,
where
it
was
held
at
the
state
must
grant
an
illegitimate
child,
the
same
right
to
support
from
his
father
as
is
possessed
by
the
legitimate
child
and
under
this
line
of
reasoning
since
the
members
of
the
complainant
class
now
have
the
same
right
to
parental
support
as
all
other
children,
the
denial
to
them
of
child's
insurance
benefits
does
not
further
the
original
purpose
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
should
not
be
sustained.
of
that
i
think,
is
a
plausible
approach
to
the
problem
at
hand
that
there
is
an
equally
plausible
approach
that
would
sustain
a
statute
and
in
these
circumstances,
this
court
should
of
course
have
difference
to
congress,
choose
the
course
that
sustains
the
validity
of
the
statute.
now,
as
we
point
at
pages
32
through
36
of
our
brief,
the
norton
case,
there
is
a
substantial
evidence,
both
in
the
legislative
history
and
directly
inferable
from
this
statutory
scheme
that
the
purpose
of
the
child’s
insurance
benefits
program
is
to
provide
support
only
for
the
dependent
children
of
disabled,
retired
or
deceased
wage
earners.
and
that
the
purpose
of
acquiring
members
of
the
complainant
class
to
prove
co-residence
or
support
is
to
restrict
the
payment
of
benefits,
to
restrict
the
payment
of
benefits
to
those
children
who
may
reasonably
be
presumed
to
have
been
dependent.
if
that
is
the
correct
view
of
the
statutory
purposes
and
we
submit
that
it
is,
then
the
statutory
scheme
must
be
sustained.
it
clearly
was
permissible
for
congress
to
seek
to
restrict
the
payment
of
dependency
benefits
to
children
who
reasonably
could
be
presumed
to
be
dependent
and
the
requirement
that
the
members
of
the
complainant
class
prove
dependency,
prove
support
or
co-residence
furthers
that
permissible
legislative
objective.
the
opposition
expressed
to
this
line
of
reasoning
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
that
under
that
view
of
the
statutory
purposes,
the
statute
is
allegedly
over
inclusive
in
that
it
grants
benefits
to
some
children
who
are
not
actually
dependent
upon
the
parental
wage
earner.
and
i
would
offer
two
answers
to
the
argument
of
over
inclusiveness.
the
first
is
the
statute
is
not
in
fact
over
inclusive,
and
the
second
is
that
in
any
event
mere
over
inclusiveness
is
not
as
sufficient
basis
from
invalidating
the
statute.
the
statute
is
not
over
inclusive
in
the
terms
that
i
have
described
it,
that
is
to
pay
benefits
to
children
who
could
reasonably
be
presumed
to
have
been
dependent
upon
parental
wage
earner.
as
we
point
out
at
pages
38
and
39
of
our
brief
in
norton
as
the
district
court
correctly
observed
in
that
case,
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
congress
to
have
extended
the
presumption
of
the
dependency
to
most
legitimate
children
and
to
four
specifically
defined
categories
of
illegitimate
children.
at
the
same
time,
the
members
of
the
complainant
class
could
not
reasonably
have
been
presumed
to
be
dependent
upon
their
fathers.
since
the
statutory
purposes
the
modest
one
of
separating
those
classes
as
to
which
the
presumption
of
the
dependency
is
reasonable
from
those
is
to
which
it
is
not
reasonable,
the
statute
is
not
in
fact
over
inclusive
in
those
terms.
but
finally,
even
if
the
statute
were
dimmed
over
inclusive
because
it
fails
to
weed
out
some
non-dependent
children
from
the
list
of
beneficiaries,
that
would
not
justify
judicial
enlargement
of
the
class
of
beneficiaries
to
include
all
other
non
dependent
children
as
well.
a
statute
that
is
over
inclusive,
but
not
under
inclusive,
that
is
a
statute
that
grants
benefits
to
some
persons
who
are
outside
the
statutory
rationale,
but
it
is
not
denied
benefits
to
any
persons
who
are
within
the
statutory
rationale,
should
not
except
for
absent
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances,
be
struck
down.
the
realities
of
the
legislative
process
and
the
complexities
of
administration
ordinarily
prevent
a
perfect
matching
of
legislative
purpose
and
effect.
a
permissible
legislative
purpose
such
as
the
purpose
here
of
restricting
benefits,
the
children
who
could
reasonable
be
presumed
to
be
dependent
upon
their
wage
earner
father
should
not
be
abandoned
wholesale
by
the
courts,
merely
because
that
purpose
has
not
been
carried
out
by
the
legislature
with
precision.
accordingly,
the
statute
here
is
the
denial
of
benefits
to
this
children
furthers
a
legitimate
and
actual
legislative
objective
that
should
be
sustained.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
i
would
like
to
make
three
quick
points
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
do,
one
minute
in
each.
first,
opposing
counsel
is
incorrect
in
stating
that
it
is
sufficient
if
the
illegitimate
child
meets
the
state
in
test
of
his
statute.
the
correct
statutory
analysis
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
pages
79
through
83
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
the
norton
case
and
also,
that
is
the
long
standing
administrative
construction
as
we
point
out
in
footnote
14
of
our
norton
brief
at
pages
38
and
39.
secondly,
the
purpose
of
the
statutory
exclusion
was
plainly
that
of
limiting
payment
of
benefits
to
children
who
were
dependent.
as
we
point
out
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
the
act
itself
limits
benefits
to
children
who
were
dependent
upon
the
wage
earner.
the
senate
report
on
the
amendments
enacting
this
provision,
state
just
correctly
describe
the
act
as
a
national
program
that
is
intended
to
pay
benefits
to
replace
the
support
lost
by
a
child
when
his
father
dies
and
this
court
recognized
this
statutory
purpose
in
its
opinion
in
jimenez
against
weinberger
where
it
pointed
out
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
provide
support
for
dependents
of
a
wage
earner
and
third,
the
validity
of
the
presumptions
of
dependency
for
the
categories
of
children
who
do
not
have
to
prove
dependency
are
we
think
broadly
rational
for
the
reasons
set
forth
at
pages
38
and
39
of
our
brief
and
i
would
further
point
out
that
if
the
evidence
is
conflicting,
if
in
some
instances
those
presumptions
may
not
be
broadly
rational,
nevertheless,
that
boils
down
simply
to
a
claim
that
the
statute
is
over
inclusive
in
its
provision
of
benefits,
not
under
inclusive
for
the
reasons
i
set
forth
in
my
argument.
mere
over
inclusiveness
would
not
result
invalidity
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
