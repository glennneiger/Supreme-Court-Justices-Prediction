mr.
jones,
would
you
help
me?
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
it
should
be
somewhat
with
the
discrimination
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates,
the
test
should
be
more
strict
than
a
rational
basis
tests.
would
you
tell
me,
what
the
test
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
i
like.
would
you
phrase
for
me
your
understanding
of
what
the
law
is
with
respect
to
the
appropriate
standard
for
this
kind
of
thing
case?
