harry

i
look
to
your
example
of
adopted
children
and
stepchildren.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
it
was
likely
they
were
supported
before?
(voice
overlap)
are
not
there
a
lot
of
adopted
children
who
are
orphans
and
a
lot
of
stepchildren
who
have
lost
a
parent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
not
answered
my
observations
that
a
lot
of
these
do
not
have
two
potentials?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
probably,
it
is
often
true,
is
it
not?
i
certainly
have
conducted
many
an
adoption
of
an
orphan
child
and
many
an
adoption
of
the
stepchild
without
a
male
or
female
parent?

mathews
against
lucas.
this
comes
to
us
from
the
decision
of
a
single
federal
district
judge
for
district
of
rhode
island.
the
social
security
act
provides
that
a
child
of
an
individual,
who
died
fully
insured
under
the
act
is
entitled
to
a
surviving
child's
benefits
if
the
child
is
18
and
was
dependent
at
the
time
of
the
parent's
death.
the
act
goes
on
to
say
that
a
child
is
considered
dependent
if
the
insured
parent
at
the
time
of
his
death
was
living
with
a
child
or
was
contributing
to
the
child's
support.
now
certain
children,
however,
need
not
submit
specific
proof
of
that
dependency.
a
child
who
is
legitimate
or
one
who
would
be
entitled
to
inherit
from
the
parent
under
state
intestacy
law
is
considered
dependent
at
the
time
of
the
parent's
death.
a
similar
presumption
of
dependency
is
made
if
the
decedent,
before
death,
had
gone
through
a
marriage
ceremony
with
the
other
parent
but
that
ceremony
for
a
non-obvious
defect
was
not
valid,
and
so
too
if
the
parent
had
acknowledged
in
writing
that
the
child
was
has
or
had
been
decreed
by
a
court
to
be
the
father
or
had
been
ordered
by
court
to
support
the
child
because
the
child
was
his.
the
appellees
here
are
illegitimate
children
of
a
diseased
insured
father.
they
were
administratively
denied
children's
benefits
on
the
ground
that
they
failed
to
show
dependency
by
proof,
either
that
their
father
lived
with
them
or
was
contributing
to
their
support
or
by
any
of
the
statutory
presumptions
of
dependency.
when
administratively
relief
was
not
forthcoming
the
appellees
brought
this
suit
against
the
secretory
of
hew
and
they
alleged
that
the
denial
of
benefits
to
them
violated
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
held,
the
district
court,
that
the
statutory
classifications
were
constitutionally
impermissible
and
it
ordered
the
payment
of
benefits.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
judicial
scrutiny
traditionally
devoted
in
cases
involved
in
discrimination
along
lines
of
race
or
national
origin
is
not
required
because
legislation
treats
legitimate
and
illegitimate
offspring
differently.
the
challenged
classifications
here
are
permissible
because
they
are
reasonably
related
to
the
likelihood
of
dependency
at
death.
in
failing
to
extend
any
presumption
of
dependency
to
the
appellees,
the
act
does
not
permissibly
discriminate
against
them
as
compared
with
legitimate
children
or
with
those
illegitimates
who
are
statutorily
deemed
dependent.
congress
here
was
able
to
avoid
the
burden
and
expense
of
case
by
case
determination
in
the
large
number
of
cases
where
dependency
is
objectively
probable.
it
is
true,
of
course,
that
the
presumptions
congress
imposed
may
be
said
to
be
approximate
rather
than
precisely
to
mirror
the
results
that
case
by
case
the
adjudication
would
show,
and
nevertheless
they
are
permissible
under
the
fifth
amendment
so
long
as
the
lack
to
precise
equivalence
does
not
exceed
the
balance
of
substantiality
to
tolerate
it
by
the
applicable
level
of
scrutiny.
the
challenged
classifications
are
justified,
therefore,
as
reasonable
and
empirical
judgments,
consistent
with
the
design
that
qualify
entitlement
to
benefits
upon
a
child's
dependency
at
the
time
of
the
parent's
death.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is

that
opinion
by

justice
brennan

justice
marshall.
