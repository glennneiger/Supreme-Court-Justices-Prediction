mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
the
district
courts
have
the
power
to
restore
victims
of
hiring
discrimination
based
on
race
to
the
present
seniority
positions
which
they
would
have
occupied
but
for
the
discriminatory
practices.
the
issue
is
presented
both
under
title
vii
of
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
other
42
u.s.
code
section
1981.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
and
awarded
retroactive
seniority
beyond
the
power
of
the
district
courts
because
in
its
view,
such
an
award
would
violate
section
703
(h)
of
title
vii.
that
section
provides
that
an
employer
may
lawfully
use
a
bona
fide
seniority
or
merit
system,
provided
that
it
is
not
the
result
of
an
intention
to
discriminate.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
address
the
question
under
section
1981.
the
legal
issues
presented
in
this
case
arises
in
circumstances
of
unvarnished
racial
discrimination
in
employment.
the
district
court
found
that
respondent
bowman
transportation
had
pursued
a
policy
of
excluding
black
employees
and
applicants
from
all
but
a
few
of
the
lowest
paying
most
menial
jobs
in
the
company.
the
enactment
of
title
vii
had
stimulated
no
change
in
bowman’s
policies.
the
company
continued
to
discriminate
in
virtually
every
aspect
of
its
operations
for
years
after
title
vii
became
effective.
and
indeed
was
still
engaged
in
most
of
its
discriminatory
practices
at
the
time
of
trial
in
march
1972.
the
district
court’s
findings
as
to
bowman’s
discriminatory
practices
read
like
a
virtual
catalog
of
unlawful
employment
practices
under
title
vii.
maintenance
of
segregated
jobs
and
segregated
departments,
a
job
seniority
system,
no
transfer
rules,
illegal,
unvalidated
testing,
racial
assignment
and
steering
of
new
employees,
word
of
mouth
recruitment
and
retaliation
against
those
few
black
employees
who
tried
to
better
themselves
despite
this
system.
the
record
presents
no
mitigating
circumstances.
before
this
court
specifically,
are
claims
arising
from
bowman’s
rejection
of
the
applications
of
qualified
black
truck
driver
applicants.
this
policy
of
exclusion
remained
absolute
until
the
eve
of
filing
of
petitioner’s
suit.
until
september
1970,
bowman
had
never
hired
a
single
black
over
the
road
driver
to
fill
its
approximately
500
road
driver
jobs.
in
september
1970,
bowman
began
to
hire
a
few
black
truck
drivers
at
one
of
its
terminals
but
continued
to
resist
hiring
black
truck
drivers
at
its
other
terminals.
at
one
of
its
major
truck
driver
terminals
in
charlotte,
the
first
black
truck
was
hired
only
a
month
before
trial.
during
the
period
1969
to
1971
which
is
the
focus
of
this
claim,
hundreds
of
black
truck
driver
applicants
applied
to
bowman.
many
of
these
applicants
were
fully
qualified
under
bowman’s
usual
standards
for
hiring.
during
the
same
time
bowman
did
hire
in
excess
of
200
white
truck
drivers
each
year.
many
of
this
white
truck
drivers
lacked
adequate
or
minimum
qualifications.
and
up
to
150
of
these
whites
were
hired
as
trainees
even
though
they
lacked
the
minimum
truck
driving
experience
supposedly
required.
bowman
hired
these
white
trainees
upon
the
personal
recommendation
of
members
of
its
all
white
or
nearly
all
white
road
driver
work
force.
when
these
unqualified
whites
were
hired
along
with
many
other
whites
who
were
no
better
qualified
than
dozens
of
unsuccessful
black
applicants.
they
began
to
accumulate
employment
date
seniority.
at
trial
the
district
court
certified
this
case
as
a
class
action
and
designated
several
sub-classes.
one
of
them,
denominated
class
three
and
represented
by
petitioner
lee
consists
of
rejected
black
road
driver
applicants.
over
200
individuals
were
identified.
those
individuals
were
given
notice
and
were
invited
to
reapply
for
hiring
by
bowman
with
priority
consideration
but
without
retroactive
seniority.
there
after,
a
few
class
three
members
reapplied
and
were
hired
began
to
drive
trucks
for
bowman.
however,
they
took
as
their
employment
seniority
date,
the
date
of
their
actual
hiring.
months
or
even
years
after
they
had
initially
filed
their
applications
and
months
or
even
years
later
than
the
employment
seniority
date
of
many
whites
who
had
initially
applied
at
the
same
time
they
did.
under
the
ruling
of
the
fifth
circuit,
these
blacks,
in
their
seniority
standing
will
never
catch
up
with
the
whites
who
were
hired
ahead
of
them.
today
or
tomorrow,
when
one
of
these
black
employees
competes
with
a
contemporary
white
applicant,
he
will
loose
out
in
bidding
and
he
will
have
less
security
from
lay-off.
moreover,
he
will
have
lesser
fringe
benefits
than
he
can—
mr.
morris
j.
baller
we
do
not
seek
to
take
seniority
from
any
white
driver.
we
simply
insist
that
he
compete
using
his
full
seniority
with
blacks
using
their
full
seniority.
the
competition
within
be
governed
among
qualified
employees
by
the
full
measure
of
seniority
for
all
of
them.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
it
would
make
a
difference
in
competitive
position,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
theoretically
correct.
in
this
case
it
is
quite
clear.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case
mr.
justice
brennan
we
have
a
high
turn
over
situation.
the
record
shows
that
about
half
the
road
drivers
turn
over
each
year
and
it
--
mr.
morris
j.
baller
i
am
aware
of
that.
as
a
practical
matter
the
grant
of
retroactive
seniority
would
subject
whites
to
increase
competition
for
all
the
things
that
seniority
gives
access
to
including
security
from
lay
off.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
the
question
is
not
the
quality
of
behavior
of
the
whites
who
were
hired,
it
is
the
quality
of
behavior
of
the
company
in
rejecting
blacks
and
the
remedy
would—
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
reiterate
our
position
that
we
do
not
seek
to
take
any
seniority
away
from
whites,
they
will
have
to
compete
with
blacks
also
enable
to
utilize
their
seniority
but
we
feel
that
is
the
central
thrust
of
the
law.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
if
a
lay-off
comes
and
it
cuts
deep
enough
to
involve
the
seniority
dates
we
are
talking
about,
that
would
be
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
chief
justice
the
lay-off
issue,
i
would
suggest
is
in
fact
not
a
single
issue
but
a
series
of
issues
which
may
arise
in
different
situations,
none
of
which
of
course
are
presented
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
there
will
be,
it
is
lurking
in
this
case.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
we
submit
that
there
will
be
cases
in
which
as
a
result
of
restitution
of
seniority
rights
to
black
employees
followed
by
lay-offs,
there
may
indeed
the
white
employees
unable
under
those
circumstances
to
all
their
jobs.
we
think
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
opened
up
all
jobs
to
fair
competition
between
blacks
and
whites
alike.
we
are
not
here
suggesting,
i
would
repeat,
bringing
in
black
employees
who
have
no
previous
relation
with
these
jobs,
no
previous
attempt
to
hold
them.
we
are
simply
asserting
the
rights
of
individuals
who
had
they
been
white
would
have
had
this
seniority,
would
have
been
able
to
compete
among
other
things
for
protection
from
lay-off.
we
do
not
think
that
a
per
se
rule
which
says
although
these
blacks
may
have
been
discriminated
against
in
the
past,
they
cannot
have
their
remedy,
if
any
whites
expectations
would
be
diminished.
we
do
not
think
that
such
a
rule
can
be
justified
as
a
general
matter.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
this
is
a
simple
case
involving
in
regard
to
this
issue,
one
job.
there
is
no
question
of
somebody
being
laid
off
who
is
less
qualified
than
someone
else,
that
would
suggest
different
questions
which
i
submit
should
be
reserved
for
cases
presenting
a
factual
record.
i
would
like
to
address
the
title
vii
issue
primarily
and
the
section
1981
issue
only
briefly.
i
would
stress
in
regard
to
title
vii
that
this
is
basically
a
question
of
remedies
and
equity.
do
the
vague
and
general
terms
of
section
703
(h)
require
a
limitation
on
what
this
court
has
found
to
be
the
sweeping
provisions
of
section
706
(g),
the
remedial
section.
this
court
has
given
a
broad
to
the
power
and
duty
of
federal
equity
courts
in
discrimination
cases
generally.
and
in
particular,
in
albemarle
paper
company
versus
moody
has
construed
title
vii
and
its
remedial
section
as
giving
the
district
court’s
sweeping
and
flexible
powers
to
make
the
victims
of
discrimination
whole.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
section,
remedial
section
of
course
is
the
same
and
it
authorizes
the
award
of
any
relief
as
maybe
appropriate
and
we
think
that
would
apply
to
injunctive
remedies
as
well
as
back
pay.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
perhaps
even
more
inexorably
since
a
job
gives
to
its
holder
not
merely
pay
but
also
other
benefits
and
seniority
in
a
situation
like
this
is
a
key
to
the
job.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
that
provision,
section
706
(g)
was
modeled
on
section
10
(c)
of
the
nlra
which
was
concerned
primarily
with
jobs.
i
would
have
to
assume
that
congress
had
foremost
in
its
mind
that
it
was
granting
access
to
jobs
and
would
have
added
the
back
pay
provision
simply
to
clarify
that
that
too
was
an
available
remedy.
the
lower
courts
in
construing
this
provision
have
invariably
from
the
beginning
granted
remedial
seniority
in
the
job
seniority
and
department
seniority
cases.
there
has
never
been
any
question
that
seniority
rights
can
be
modified
where
necessary
to
rectify
discrimination.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
chief
justice,
court
after
court
has
held
that
the
expectations
of
white
employees
even
though
innocent
of
wrong
doing
maybe
modified
in
order
to
grant
full
relief
under
the
act.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
those
--
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
chief
justice,
those
decisions
began
to
come
down
as
soon
as
cases
were
decided
on
the
merits
in
about
1968
and
they
have
continued
to
the
present.
i
think
there
has
been
no
question
as
to
the
viability
of
that
doctrine
in
the
case
of
transfer
seniority
rights.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
there’s
any
distinction
between
transfer
seniority
and
retroactive
hiring
seniority
and
we
submit
that
there
is
not.
it
would
be
anomalous
to
say
that
a
black
employee
who
was
sent
to
a
laborer
job
may
now
transfer
to
white
jobs
with
his
full
seniority
where
as
the
back
applicant
who
applied
for
the
white
job
in
the
first
place
and
was
turned
down
can
get
no
remedy.
that
would
be
the
effect
of
drawing
a
line
between
the
well
settled
job
seniority
cases
and
these
new
retroactive
seniority
cases.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
white,
in
this
case
our
class
as
defined
by
the
district
court
consists
of
individuals
who
applied
and
were
rejected.
only
those
individuals
who
were
qualified
or
who
proved
that
they
are
qualified
would
be
reinstated
and
it
is
those
individuals
--
mr.
morris
j.
baller
in
this
case
i
have
stated
the
class
and
in
any
case
it
would
be
a
matter
for
evidentiary
determination
by
the
district
courts
in
light
of
the
applicable
principles
of
equity
and
the
make
whole
purpose
of
title
vii.
i
would
not
think
that
there
could
be
a
general
formulation
of
who
would
or
would
not
be
entitled
to
consideration
in
any
case
for
retroactive
seniority.
but
in
this
case,
the
individuals
for
home
relief
is
sought
are
clearly
identified.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
the
retroactive
seniority
i
assume
would
only
apply
to
individuals
who
are
reinstated
who
actually
work
and
that
would
depend
on
determinations
as
to
their
qualifications,
etcetera.
nobody
would
receive
retroactive
seniority
who
is
not
otherwise
entitled
to
a
job.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
as
defined
by
the
district
court,
yes.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
this
retroactive
seniority
would
only
accrue
upon
reinstatement.
the
district
court
did
not
order
anyone
reinstated.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
hiring
upon
reapplication.
the
district—
mr.
morris
j.
baller
well,
post
decree.
the
district
court
invited,
ordered
bowman
to
invite
reapplications.
many
individuals
reapplied,
only
a
few
were
hired.
the
retroactive
seniority
claim
is
for
those
who
were
hired
plus
those
whose
rights
we
are
no
litigating
in
the
district
court
on
remand
who
may
be
adjudged,
entitled
to
reinstatement
by
the
district
court.
retroactive
seniority
is
meaningless
for
those
individuals
who
do
not
any
longer
have
any
interest
in
working
at
bowman
or
who
are
not
qualified.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
they
would
have
a
right
to
back
pay
if
they
had
worked
at
bowman
without
their
retroactive
seniority
and
we
have
several
such
individuals.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
blackmun
--
mr.
morris
j.
baller
i
am
afraid
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
we
simply
overlooked
those
cases
if
they
are
pertinent.
we
did
note
world
war
ii
cases
in
which
returning
veterans
and
individuals
who
were
not
employed
at
the
time
they
were
in
the
army
--
were
allowed
to
secure
retroactive
seniority
rights
pursuant
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
thank
you
mr.
justice.
i
would
like
to
turn
just
briefly
to
the
section
1981
issue.
our
position
is
that
whatever
result
the
court
reaches
under
its
analysis
of
section
703
(h)
and
title
vii,
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
retroactive
seniority
under
section
1981.
as
this
court
held
in
johnson
versus
railway
express
agency,
section
1981
remedies
are
independent
and
distinct.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
brennan
i
do
not
believe
those
are
presented
in
the
case.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
there
is
no
preference
sought
here
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
seek
for
these
black
employees
to
be
in
the
position
which
the
record
makes
clear
they
would
be
in
had
they
been
white
or
had—
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice,
at
the
same
time
we
do
not
think
that
based
on
the
narrow
record
presented
here,
the
court
can
or
should
decide
that
only
in
the
instance
of
a
written
application
could
an
employee
not
be
in
a
job
which
he
otherwise
would
have
been
in.
they
may
well
--
—
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
that
is
correct
but
i
would
stress
that
the
lower
courts
frequently
find
discrimination
in
hiring
in
regard
to
people
who
did
not
apply,
who
were
deterred
from
applying
by
a
word
of
mouth
recruitment
system
or
by
a
reputation
well
known
in
a
community
that
an
employer
would
not
hire
blacks
and
so
on.
those
claims
while
not
present
in
this
case
should
not
be
foreclosed.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
it
would
not
mean
direct
bumping
out
of
jobs,
people
presently
hold.
it
would
mean
that—
mr.
morris
j.
baller
well,
in
this
case
certainly
we
have
not
asked
for
that
and
i
think
generally
the
courts
have
been
reluctant
to
grant
--
mr.
morris
j.
baller
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
draw
a
distinction
between
cases
in
which
a
discriminatee
is
placed
in
a
job
held
by
a
white
employee
who
is
immediately
displaced
and
other
situations
--
mr.
morris
j.
baller
or
any
other
employee.

mr.

i
believe
the
emphasis
and
much
of
the
controversy
in
the

has
been
over
the
theory

justifies
the
rightful

the

not

mr.

mr.
justice
blackmun
i
certainly
wish
to
suggest
that
the
issue
is
not
lurking,
it
is
there
and
under
our
theory,
if
blacks
have
retroactive
seniority
and
a
lay
off
comes
and
someone
must
be
laid
off
it
would
be
according
to
seniority.
there
would
be
no
preservation
of
expectations
founded
on
past
discrimination
for
whites.
certainly
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
we
would
not
advance
that
position.
it
does
however
raise
different
issues.

mr.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
couple
of
brief
points
in
rebuttal
as
to
mootness,
our
position
is
that
because
the
existence
of
class
members
where
their
lives
stake
in
the
controversy
and
a
certified
class
action,
the
case
does
fit
within
the
sosna
rule
and
it
is
viable.
moreover,
johnny
lee
had
a
life
claim
at
the
time
the
case
was
certified.
with
respect
to
discretion
i
submit
that
the
court
reviews
what
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
actually
held,
it
will
see
quite
clearly
that
this
was
not
an
exercise
of
discretion
nor
was
it
affirmed
as
such
by
the
court
of
appeals
rather
they
were
erroneous
rules
of
law.
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
this
on,
presumably
innocent
white
employees,
i
would
simply
note
that
as
the
court
has
frequently
held,
seniority
being
contractual
is
subject
to
modification
to
conform
with
law.
and
focusing
on
the
innocence
of
affected
employees
would
create
the
kind
of
subjective
standard
which
this
court
has
abjured
in
griggs
and
other
employment
discrimination
cases.
finally
with
regard
to
the
reliance
by
mr.
gottesman
on
the
clark
case
materials
to
create
a
distinction
between
pre-act
and
post-act
discrimination
which
he
conceives
is
reflected
nowhere
in
the
statute
itself,
i
would
simply
state
to
the
court
our
position
that
the
lower
courts
have
made
it
clear
that
clark
case
materials
cannot
be
read
literally
to
convey
the
congressional
intention
on
their
face,
they
are
far
broader
than
both
the
terms
of
the
statute
and
broader
than
any
construction,
the
court’s
have
been
willing
to
give
in
stating
that
no
pre-1965
seniority
rights
would
ever
be
affected
by
any
title
vii
action.
that
simply
has
not
been
an
acceptable
interpretation
in
the
courts.
finally,
i
would
just
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
all
we
seek
is
the
same
as
this
court
has
accorded
to
all
claims
of
employment
discrimination
brought
under
title
vii
from
griggs
through
albemarle
paper
that
is
a
construction
which
assures
that
victims
of
discrimination
will
have
a
chance
to
prove
in
court
that
they
were
wrong
and
upon
proof
of
discrimination
that
they
are
entitled
to
ask
complete
relief
as
is
possible
in
the
circumstances.
we
fee
that
this
petitioners
deserve
no
less.
thank
you.
mr.
morris
j.
baller
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
section
1981
is
a
separate
remedy.
we
feel
that
the
interference
with
contractual
rights
in
the
nature
of
seniority
benefits,
is
it
violates
the
prohibition
in
section
1981
on
discrimination
in
making
an
enforcement
of
contracts
and
there
should
be
a
cause
of
action
with
a
right
retroactive
seniority
to
restore
those
contractual
benefits.
congress
specifically
rejected
amendments
that
would
have
made
title
vii
the
exclusive
remedy
for
employment
discrimination
and
as
this
court
held
in
alexander,
it
did
not
mean
in
enacting
title
vii
to
repeal
pre-existing
remedies.
thank
you.
