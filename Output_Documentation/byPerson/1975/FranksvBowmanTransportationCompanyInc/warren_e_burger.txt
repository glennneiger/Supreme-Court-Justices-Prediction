chief

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
franks
and
lee
against
bowman
transportation
company.
mr.
baller
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
seniority
is
granted,
that
is
at
who's
expense
in
a
sense,
if
the
seniority
is
retroactively
granted,
what
happens
to
the
man
who
--
how’s
the
seniority
now,
this
is
not
something
that
can
be
divided,
is
it?
it
has
to
be
taken
away
from
one
person
in
order
to
give
it
to
another.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
suggests
that
somewhere
in
your
brief,
i
got
the
impression
that
you
at
least
(inaudible)
that
they
took
these
jobs
with
a
sort
of
a
lien
on
them
even
though
they
might
be
innocent
of
any
participation
in
the
failure
on
the
conduct
on
which
this
action
is
based.
is
that
the
theory
that
they
do
take
it
to
at
some
sort
of
a
lien
or
cloud
on
the
title
seniority.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
take
something
away
from
the
driver
hired
earlier,
you
are
depriving
him
of
something
that
he
thought
that
he
had,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
to
the
specific
practical
problems
mr.
justice
brennan
alluded
to
on
a
lay
off
and
we
must
deal
with
the
generality
and
not
the
idiosyncrasies
of
this
company.
on
a
lay-off,
someone
is
going
to
be
laid
off,
if
retroactive
seniority
is
accorded
to
the
class
that
you
represent,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
we
justify
taking
away
in
affect,
taking
away
from
peter
to
pay
paul?
both
of
them
are
innocent
of
any
wrong
doing.
each
of
them
is
innocent
to
any
wrong
doing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
lurking
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
at
the
expense
of
an
innocent
fellow
employee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
before
we
had
some
things
to
say
about
the
expectations
of
employees
in
the
last
two
years,
i
would
place
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.

school
teachers
cases
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
have
got
to
approach
this
on
the
theory
that
the
original
reinstatement
as
a
result
of
a
claim
followed
by
reinstatement
with
retroactive
seniority
may
result
either
a,
in
the
immediate
bumping
of
x-number
of
people
or
at
sometime
in
the
future.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
at
some
point
will
you
suggest
whether
it
did
not
occur
to
congress
that
this
might
create
some
rights
for
a
remedy
on
the
part
of
the
innocent
“purchaser.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
employee
recognizes
that
he
is
being
put
in
his
rightful
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
in
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
congress
was
not
concerned
at
all
about
whether
some
employees
were
going
to
be
displaced
either
from
their
seniority
or
from
their
actual
employment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
not
something
mutually
exclusive
about
those
promises?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
their
lurking
here
the
possibility
of
a
potential
injury
in
the
sense
that
it
had
displaced
employee,
displaced
by
a
virtue
of
the
retroactive
seniority
might
bring
a
suit
against
bowman.
not
in
the
setting
of
this
case
but
in
the
overall
picture.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
come
to
the
day
of
a
lay
off
or
when
you
come
to
the
day
when
two
men
are
competing
for
a
job
and
one
gets
it
because
he
has
been
granted
retroactive
seniority.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
of
course,
supposed
we
have
all
got
to
bear
in
mind
that
a
great
many
new
causes
of
action
that
we
did
not
think
about
years
ago
are
now
suddenly
emerging.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
these
class
members
certainly
have
a
substantial
financial
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation,
do
they
not
mr.
pate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
you
have
about
four
minutes
left
mr.
baller.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-728,
franks
against
the
bowman
transportation
company
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
