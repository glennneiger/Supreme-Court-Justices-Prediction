justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
baller
can
you
over,
excuse
me.
i
am
just
speaking
through
memory
now
but
a
while
back
did
we
not
have
a
similar
kind
of
issue
with
respect
to
seniority
under
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act
when
boys
were
coming
back
from
service
and
they
wanted
in
at
the
same
time
and
at
the
same
place
as
though
they
had
worked
continuously
during
their
period
of
military
service.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
find
those
cases
not
cited
by
either
side
here
and
i
wonder
if
they
are
completely
impertinent.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
i
have
in
mind
specifically
and
i
would
be
interested
for
one
in
post
argument
comments
from
both
sides
on
tilton
against
missouri
pacific
in
376
u.s.
as
to
whether
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
case.
i
remember
it
very
vividly
because
this
court
reversed
me
and
probably
properly
so.[laughing]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
baller
i
guess
i
do
not
understand
why
you
are
so
concerned
about
confessing
that
in
the
background
there
is
the
lay
off
possibly
of
other
people.
what
is
wrong
with
that
on
your
theory?
they
may
be
innocent
as
the
chief
justice
described
them
but
they
attained
a
spot
that
they
should
not
have
obtained,
had
the
law
been
in
effect,
and
hence
i
wonder
why
you
are
so
sensitive
about
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
baller
if
you
loose
under
title
vii
could
you
still
prevail
under
1981?
