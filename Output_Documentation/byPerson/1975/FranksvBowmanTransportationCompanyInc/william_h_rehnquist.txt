bowman’s
operations
do
not
present
the
problem
either,
do
they
where
someone
may
have
come
in
one
capacity
and
gradually
moved
up
to
more
and
more
responsible
positions
where
you
might
have
some
question
of
job
qualification
for
what
that
person
is
shooting
for.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
in
albemarle
the
statutes
specifically
and
said
including
back
pay,
here
it
does
not
specifically
deal
with
seniority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
think
that
seniority
would
follow
as
inexorably
as
back
pay
would
in
the
typical
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
why
did
congress
single
out
back
pay
and
mention
it
in
not
single
seniority?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
that
pretty
much
the
limits
of
your
class,
what
you
just
described?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
all
members
of
the
class
then
would
receive
retroactive
seniority.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
reinstatement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hiring
in
the
first
instance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
these
people
certainly
aren’t
trying
to
--aren’t
fighting
over
any
abstract
right
of
seniority
in
order
to
get
a
25-year
pin.
they
want
something
tangible
as
a
result,
don’t
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
in
fact
petitioners
are
entitled
to
what
they
ask
for
here
but
they
are
not
entitled
to
anything
broader
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
not
argue
precisely
the
opposite
of
that
effect
that
there
will
not
be
much
displacement
or
much
defeat
of
expectations
of
people
who
are
already
there,
so
why
not
go
ahead
and
give
it.
