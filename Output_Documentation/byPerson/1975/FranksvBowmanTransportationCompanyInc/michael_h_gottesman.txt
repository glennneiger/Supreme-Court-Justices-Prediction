mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
union
agrees
with
the
relief
which
the
petitioners
seek
in
this
case
though
not
in
its
entirety
with
the
analysis
by
which
they
get
there.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
redefining
as
it
were
precisely
who
we
are
talking
about
here,
precisely
what
they
seek,
because
i
think
that
is
important
to
the
analysis.
we
are
talking
about
a
group
of
people
who
did
apply
for
employment
and
whom
the
district
court
found
would
have
been
hired
but
for
the
fact
that
they
were
black.
and
the
relief
which
is
sought
is
sought
only
for
those
people
who
but
for
discrimination
would
have
been
hired
at
an
earlier
date.
now,
what
the
district
court
said
to
this
company
was,
“you
shall
now
as
vacancies
arise,
no
bumping,
but
as
vacancies
arise,
you
shall
now
offer
the
next
available
vacancies
to
these
group
of
people.”
but
the
district
court
said,
“when
they
finally
get
a
job,
their
seniority
date
will
only
be
from
the
date
that
you
finally
give
them
the
job.”
and
what
they
say
is,
“but
for
discrimination
you
would
have
hired
us
eight
months
ago
or
a
year
ago.”
and
but
for
discrimination
there
for
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
number
is
very
small.
i
do
not
have
it.
we
are
talking
about—
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
five,
six,
seven,
something
in
that
—
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
baller
who
is
involved
at
the
trial
level
knows
better.
its
at
least
several
dozen
but
not
all
of
those
will
be
eligible
for
the
relief
because
not
all
of
them
will
prove
to
have
been
qualified
at
the
time
that
they
applied
and
thus
it
can
not
be
said
of
all
them.
that
they
would
have
have
been
hired
but
for
the
discrimination.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
they
wanted
back
to
the
date
they
would
have
have
been
hired.
it
might
be
a
few
days
or
weeks
after
the
first
applied.
but
they
want
in
effect
to
be
restored
to
the
position
that
they
would
occupy
had
they
never
been
discriminated
against.
and
that
relief
it
seems
to
us
and
i
will
get
into
a
statutory
analysis
in
a
moment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
our
position
is
no,
that
in
remedying
discrimination
generally
under
title
vii.
the
courts
have
adopted
what
is
called
the
rightful
place
approach
which
includes
not
only
giving
people
the
right
seniority
but,
rather
than
bumping
people
saying,
“you
shall
begin
to
exercise
this
seniority,
the
first
the
time
a
vacancy
is
created.”
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
literally
provides
that.
but
from
1967
when
the
decisions
first
came
down
until
date,
the
lower
courts
have
unanimously
endorsed
in
the
belief
that
more
surely
have
been
what
congress
intended.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
it
is.
now
as
mr.
baller
said,
in
this
case
it
makes
no
difference
because
vacancies
arise
every
day
and
another
case
it
make
it
a
difference.
but
whatever
one
decided
about
that,
one
thing
is
unmistakably
clear
that
once
an
employee
does
get
to
work,
he
uses
his
full
seniority
under
this
theory
for
all
purposes
in
the
future.
there
is
no
question
that
if
a
lay
off
comes,
he
will
keep
the
job
and
the
white
who
was
hired
earlier
but
after
the
date
the
black
should
have
been
hired
will
be
laid
off
first.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
can
only
say
that
so
far
as
i
know
the
legislative
history
is
silent.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
if
i
may
i
can
argue
why
we
think
the
statute
requires
rightful
place.
and
i
think
it
may
become
clear
from
that
why
it
does
not
inevitably
follow
that
it
requires
bumping.
at
least
immediate
bumping
because
of
course
to
give
the
people
of
the
seniority
means
that
there
will
inevitable
bumping
at
the
time
of
lay
offs
and
other
opportunity.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
let
me
address
that
because
i
think
that
is
critical
to
the
analysis
here
and
it
is
obviously
the
source
of
some
concern
of
court.
it
is
true
that
the
whites
who
were
hired
during
this
intervening
period
are
innocent.
they
have
done
no
wrong,
they
have
committed
no
violation
of
law.
and
it
is
true
that
they
will
suffer
a
competitive
disadvantage
if
this
people
are
invested
with
their
seniority.
but
it
does
not
follow
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
that
their
having
anything
taken
away
form
them,
that
should
be
a
source
of
concern
because
they
too
are
being
in
their
rightful
place.
when
the
black
employee
is
advanced
ahead
of
them
on
the
seniority
roster
the
white
is
simply
being
restored
to
the
position
he
would
have
been
in
from
the
start.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely
not,
i
can
tell
you
from
experience
that
he
does
not.
but
we
deal
with
congress’
intentions
not
the
employees.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
congress
was
concerned
about
that
in
a
wide
variety
of
context
other
than
the
narrow
one
we
are
dealing
with
and
if
i
can
get
into
the
statutory
analysis,
i
think
i
can
explain
both
the
nature
of
that
concern
and
its
limits
and
why
it
does
not
extend
to
this
case
because
there
is
no
question
that
congress
was
concerned
about
this.
let
me
start
by
saying
this,
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
the
first
sentence
of
section
706(g)
generally
encompassed
a
congressional
intention
to
make
people
whole
for
the
effects
of
discrimination
visited
against
them
to
make
whole
those
who
suffer
the
discrimination.
and
what
in
essence
the
court
below
said
is
that
there
is
carved
out
of
this
make
whole
remedy.
a
category
of
relief
which
you
cannot
give
even
though
it
would
make
whole
to
with
the
retroactive
seniority.
and
so
the
focus
our
question
has
to
be
is
that
indeed,
why
section
703(h)
is
in
the
statute.
was
it
put
there
to
put
a
limit
on
what
would
otherwise
be
legitimate
make
whole
relief.
and
i
suggest
that
the
answer
that
cannot
come
by
looking
first
at
section
703(h).
the
answer
to
that
question
has
to
come
by
looking
at
the
history
of
the
legislative
debate.
because
when
congress,
when
this
bill
was
first
introduced
and
it
was
a
bipartisan
bill,
section
706(g)
at
that
time
not
only
had
the
first
sentence
to
make
whole
provision,
it
also
had
a
last
sentence.
and
the
last
sentence
was
what
we
have
characterized
as
the
anti-preference
section.
it
said,
“you
shall
not
give
relief
to
people
who
were
not
the
victims
of
discrimination.”
so
that
on
the
one
hand
you
shall
make
whole
those
who
are
victims
of
discrimination,
on
the
other
you
shall
not
give
preference
to
those
who
were
not
victims
of
discrimination.
now
though
--
the
statutory
language
was
very
clear
or
the
language
of
the
bill
was
very
clear.
that
did
not
prevent
its
declaimers
from
going
all
over
the
countryside
suggesting
that
that
indeed
was
not
what
title
vii
was
going
to
mean.
and
there
was
voice
both
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
throughout
the
land
because
the
period
of
time
we
are
talking
about
was
during
the
presidential
primary
of
1964.
the
impending
title
vii
was
an
issue
of
great
debate
during
that
primary
and
at
least
one
candidate
made
the
defeat
of
that
bill,
one
of
his
major
issues.
and
so
we
have
the
anomaly
of
unions
appearing
before
congress
saying
“enact
the
statute.”
well
congressmen
were
being
inundated
by
letters
from
presumably
white
workers
saying,
“do
not
pass
that
statute.
that
statute
is
going
to
give
all
kinds
preferences
to
people.”
because
indeed
the
detractors
were
saying
this
statute
will
give
preferences.
and
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
three
month
filibuster
over
this
bill
and
the
floor
managers
of
the
bill,
senators
clark
and
case
introduced
literally
an
avalanche
of
written
legislative
history
designed
to
reassure
all
of
these
concerns.
the
theme
of
that
repeatedly
was
this
bill
though
it
is
designed
to
end
discrimination
and
make
whole
its
victims,
is
not
intended
to
give
any
preferences
to
anybody
on
a
count
of
race.
it
is
not
designed
to
--
in
one
fell
swoop
cure
an
entire
national
history
of
discrimination
all
its
designed
to
do
is
to
make
sure
that
from
this
day
forward,
employers
and
union
shall
not
discriminate.
and
that
the
victims
of
that
discrimination
which
occurs
from
this
day
forward
will
be
made
whole.
there
will
be
no
qoutas,
there
will
not
be
no
special
seniority
rights
as
they
called
it.
we
are
just
going
to
stop
discrimination
as
of
this
date
and
give
remedies
to
those
who
suffer
any
continued
discrimination.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
yes
i
think
they
are
indeed,
our
brief
suggests
that
they
are
mutually
exclusive
that
they
define
a
rather
clear
line
between
that
which
may
be
done
and
that
which
may
not.
and
as
we
see
that
line
the
line
is,
that
you
may
give
to
the
victim
of
discrimination.
that
relief
which
will
make
him
whole,
that
will
restore
him
to
the
position
that—
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
it
seems
clear
to
us
and
one
of
the
place
where
we
disagree
with
the
petitioners
is
that
they
are
unwilling
to
acknowledge
that
this
statute
clearly
precludes
preferences.
and
by
their
unwillingness
to
acknowledge
that
they
make
the
legal
argument
hazier
than
we
think
it
ought
to
be.
we
think
it
is
very
clear
that
once
you
recognize
that
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
this
additional
provisions
being
tucked
in
to
the
of
the
back
of
the
statute
then
you
can
see
that
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
section
706(g)
in
its
first
sentence.
what
703(h)
does
and
its
part
of
a
mosaic
was
that
after
the
sponsors
had
literally
grown
hoarse
resisting
claims
that
this
statute
was
a
preference
statute.
they
were
still
confronted
with
the
filibuster
and
they
were
still
confronted
with
people
screaming
that
indeed
it
did
create
preferences.
and
so
there
was
a
whole
revision
of
the
bill,
the
so
called
“dirksen-mansfield
compromise
bill”
which
reincorporated
the
central
provisions
of
the
statute
intact.
the
provisions
that
define
discrimination
and
the
remedy
provision.
but
added
a
whole
series
of
provisos
that
which
703(h)
was
one
and
703(j),
this
sections
that
literally
talks
about
no
preferences
being
another.
and
it
is
those
sections
whose
meaning
is
really
the
critical
issue
before
the
court.
but
--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
on
that
we
are
dependent
upon
the
statements
of
senator
clark
and
case
in
the
department
of
justice,
all
of
which
are
clearly
writ
in
the
legislative
history.
and
they
made
it
clear
in
essence
that
that
line
was
drawn
because
they
said
the
act
only
forbids
discrimination
from
this
date
forward.
so
that
it
may
be
true
for
example
that
last
week
an
employer
refused
to
hire
someone.
but
that
person
is
not
the
victim
of
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
therefore
he
is
no
t
entitled
to
a
make
whole
remedy
because
he
was
discriminated
against
before
this
law
was
passed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
am
sorry,
last
week
before
the
law
was
passed.
i
am
sorry,
forgive
me.
but
they
were
saying
as
of
july
2,
1965,
anyone
who
from
that
date
forward
is
discriminated
against,
is
the
victim
of
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
he
therefore
shall
get
a
remedy.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
is
to
be
made
whole,
he
has
to
be
given
the
position
that
he
would
have
have
occupied
but
for
discrimination.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
he
will,
in
that
sense,
yes,
but
that
is
not
what
we
mean
by
preference.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
sure.
in
one
sense
of
preferred,
he
is
preferred.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
right.
now,
but
we
think
703(h)
means
is
that
it
is
conformation
as
is
703(j)
and
is
so
much
of
the
written
legislative
history,
that
there
is
not
to
be
a
more
general
kind
of
preference,
there
is
not
to
be
a
judgment
made
for
example,
this
employer
never
hired
blacks
until
1972.
therefore
we
ought
to
say
that
'x'
%
of
blacks
hired
in
the
future
will
be
given
an
arranged
of
seniority
dates
in
order
to
slot
them
into
some
non-discriminatory
and
seemingly
reasonable
[inaudible]
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
and
they
do
not
seek
anything
broader
in
this
case
but
there
are
other
cases
where
broader
relief
is
sought.
we
discussed
some
in
our
brief.
watkins
is
the
clearest
one,
but
there
are
a
range,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
we
have
the
answer
all
at
one
time
for
the
entire
range
of
facts.
what
for
example
of
the
employee
who
did
not
apply
for
a
job
in
1970
because
he
knew
this
company
did
not
hire
blacks
but
who
comes
forward
in
1972
and
says,
“i
should
get
two
years
of
seniority
would
have
been
feudal
to
apply.”
that
involves
some
of
the
fact
type
questions
this
court
dealt
with
in
blue
chips
stamps
and
in
an
entirely
different
context.
we
are
not
suggesting
the
answer
to
that,
i
think
that
is
something
that
has
to
be
litigated
in
the
future
but
from
that
litigation
will
emerge
an
answer.
that
person
either
is
or
is
not
the
victim
of
discrimination.
the
ultimate
determination
is
that
he
is
a
victim
of
discrimination
then
he
will
be
entitled
to
make
whole.
if
the
answer
is
that
he
is
not
because
unless
you
apply
for
a
job,
you
are
not
a
victim
then
he
will
not
be
entitled
to
any
seniority.
and
so
the
line
we
see
is
a
very
clear
one
but
it
is
important
to
see
both
sides
of
the
line
because
if
you
only
try
to
look
at
one
as
petitioners
do,
you
slide
into
the
problem
that
everybody
says
“but
where
does
this
line
stop.”
and
to
us
the
line
is
very
clear,
the
two
sides
of
it
at
least
in
this
case
are
clear
and
this
case
falls
on
the
make
whole
side.
petitioners
seek
nothing
but
that
which
they
would
have
had
but
for
discrimination.
