but
can
it
make
a
difference
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
mean
perhaps
of
that
a
black
driver
would
retain
a
job
when
a
white
driver
would
have
to
be
laid
off.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
practically
correct?
or
do
you
have
a—
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
decision
will
not
be
for
this
case
alone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
baller,
may
i
just
--getting
back
to
the
other
issue.
do
we
not
have
some
of
the
issues
we
did
not
reach
in
the
fullness
and
did
not
decide
on
these.
do
we
have
some
of
those
working
in
the
background
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
you
that
you
regard
this
as
simply
a
rightful
place
kinda
case
and
not
a
preference
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
nevertheless
tend
to
think
we
should
have
--
maybe
some
overtones
in
the
field.
preference
involved
in
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
refused
employment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
a
year
or
two
ago
and
now
they
are
getting
--
they
are
being
employed
and
they
want
to
be
employed
where
they
would
have
been,
had
they
been
employed
when
they
first
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
do
not
have
here,
the
maintenance
of
any
racial
structure
or
the
like.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
in
fact
been
employed
and
their
compliant
is
they
have
not
been
given
their
rightful
place
on
the
seniority
roster.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
ought
to
have
the
place
that
they
would
have
had,
had
they
been
employed
a
year
ago
or
two
years
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
have
not
reached
any
of
the
questions
that
involve
lay
offs
or
other
circumstances.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
can
you
escape
them?
someday
bowman’s
going
to
have
lay
people
off,
isn’t
it?

the
case
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
district
court
held
that
certain
black
applicants
from
employment
as
over-the-road
truck
drivers,
were
in
violation
of
title
vii,
discriminatorily
denied
jobs,
on
the
basis
of
their
rights.
however
in
fashioning
relief,
the
district
court
denied
relief
in
the
form
of
seniority
status
retroactive
to
the
dates
of
individual
applications
for
the
over-the-road
positions.
and
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
we
reverse
and
we
hold
that
an
award
of
seniority
retroactive
to
the
date
of
the
individual
job
application
is
appropriate
under
section
706
(g)
of
title
vii,
which,
to
effectuate
title
vii's
objective
of
making
persons
whole
for
injuries
suffered
on
account
of
unlawful
employment
discrimination,
because
merely
to
require
the
employer
to
hire
the
victim
of
discrimination
falls
far
short
of
a
"make
whole"
remedy,
and
a
concomitant
award
of
the
seniority
credit,
he
presumptively
would
have
earned,
but
for
the
wrongful
treatment
is
also
necessary
absent
of
course
a
proper
justification,
for
denying
that
relief.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part

dissenting
in

mr.
