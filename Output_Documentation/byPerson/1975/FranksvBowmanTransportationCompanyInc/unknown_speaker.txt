unknown
speaker
there
would
be
an
individual
determination
in
--
when
you
get
to
the
matter
of
remedy.
unknown
speaker
alright,
clearly
identified
but
on
what
grounds
would
they
be
--
assume
you
prevailed
would
they
--
all
of
those
automatically
receive
the
super
seniority
or
would
there
still
be
proceedings
in
the
individuals?
unknown
speaker
but
they
still
collect
that
some
kind
of
damages.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baller,
can
you
over
--
unknown
speaker
--
or
these
i
gather
are
employees
who
in
fact
applied—
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
have
here
don’t
we
have
(voice
overlapped)
unknown
speaker
only
those
who
in
fact
applied.
unknown
speaker
and
were
refused
employment.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
stick
to
that
narrow
question
we
do
not
reach
any
of
these
other
suits.
unknown
speaker
the
reinstatement
with
the
retroactive
seniority
does
could
mean
and
would
mean
displacement
of
people
with
lesser
seniority.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
this
case?
or
in
the
case
generally?
unknown
speaker
or
any
other
employee—
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway
mr.
baller,
as
i
understand
you
what
--
the
fact
situation
we
have
here
is
this,
there
is
a
work
force,
that
work
force
has
been
added
to
by
employing
these
people
who
are
previously
been
refused
employment,
is
that
not?
they
have
in
fact
been
employed.
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
them
have
been
hired?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
size
of
the
group?
unknown
speaker
who
have
been
hired?
what
is
the
total
group
involved.
unknown
speaker
well
at
least
the
half
dozen
who
have
been
found
qualified
and
have
been
hired.
unknown
speaker
and
as
per
them
they
have
been
getting
their
seniority
from
the
date
they
were
hired.
unknown
speaker
and
they
want
it
back
to
the
date
they
first
applied
were
discriminatorily
refused
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
with
the
same
approach
mr.
gottesman,
or
what’s
your
approach
mean,
that
the
district
court
could
have
ordered
them
to
work
right
away
even
though
it
meant
bumping.
unknown
speaker
well
there
maybe,
but
what’s
your
position?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
is
it
clear
to
you
that
congress
never
intended
a
remedy
which
would
require
bumping?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
suggest
that
if
the
history
did
not
--
statute
did
not
require
that
in
the
way
of
a
remedy,
nevertheless
the
statute
requires
rightful
place
seniority.
unknown
speaker
this
area
at
least
congress
expressly
rejected
what
(inaudible)
involved
in
a
way
of
preferential
--
unknown
speaker
but
can
you
find
anything
in
this
several
sections
particularly
706(g)
which
draws
the
distinction
between
pre-act
discrimination
and
post-act.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think,
you
mean
last
week
before
the
law
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
for
post
act
violations?
unknown
speaker
well
he
is
going
to
be
in
this
case
as
vacancies
occur
he
is
to
be
preferred.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
all
right,
that
that
he
is
just
being
preferred.
unknown
speaker
we
always
prefer,
in
the
sense
of
somebody
else
does
not
get
the
job.
and
the
reason
is
that
because
he
has
been
discriminated
against.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
they
act
affirmatively
prohibits
you,
you
said
it,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
address
itself
to
this?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
let's
assume
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
or
they
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(or
do
you
want
to
say
that
even
it
was
wrong,
the
district
court
was
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pate
i
do
not
fully
understand.
right
in
what
respect,
these
people
in
any
event
were
not
qualified?
unknown
speaker
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
said
yes.
unknown
speaker
which
one
was
this,
mr.
pate?
