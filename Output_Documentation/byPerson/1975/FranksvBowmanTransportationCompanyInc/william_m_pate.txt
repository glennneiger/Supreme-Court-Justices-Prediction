mr.
william
m.
pate
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
not
seeking
to
sustain
court
of
appeal's
interpretation
of
section
703(h).
we
agree
with
the
other
parties
that
the
interpretation
is
not
correct.
that
is
our
view.
we
do
not
agree
with
everything
that
the
other
parties
are
saying
en
route
to
that
conclusion.
we
think
that
it
is
clear
form
the
legislative
history
and
from
that
terms
and
words
of
the
statute
itself
that
this
section
was
intended
to
have
a
definite
effect.
it
was
intended
to
place
a
limitation
both
on
the
substantive
provisions
of
title
vii
and
on
the
remedies
that
are
available
under
it.
now
there
has
been
discussion
of
the
distinction
between
pre-act
discrimination
and
post-act
discrimination.
that
distinction,
i
would
i
say
is
a
starting
point,
i
would
consider
valid.
however,
i
would
go
farther
than
that.
i
think
that
congress
was
drawing
a
distinction
here
between
the
discrimination
which
is
the
subject
of
the
case
that
is
specifically
before
the
court
indicates
and
for
which
it
is
framing
a
remedy,
as
compared
with
general
discrimination
in
the
past
which
is
it
not
seeking
to
remedy
in
the
case.
for
example,
i
think
that
congress
foresaw
the
concept
which
has
developed
under
this
statute,
i
might
say
different
from
anything
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
which
it
has
been
compared
under
which
practices
which
are
racially
neutral
in
themselves
are
held
to
be
violative
of
the
act
because
of
their
continuation
of
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
including
pre-act
discrimination.
now,
congress
apparently
saw
that
and
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
it
was
consigned
that
the
statute
would
taken
its
sweep,
seniority
rights
under
numerous
seniority
systems
over
the
country
either
under
union
contracts
or
under
company
policy.
well,
the
system
itself
had
been
affected
by
race
discrimination
in
the
past
and
even
those
that
might
be
affected
by
racial
discrimination
in
the
future.
so,
we
think
that
is
the
important
distinction
in
section
703(h).
now,
concededly
here,
the
discrimination
that
we
are
talking
about
occurred
after
title
vii.
consequently,
we
are
not
talking
about
just
a
system
that
continuously
affect
the
past
discrimination.
now
its
our
view
that
in
the
case
of
this
kind
that
the
court
has
the
same
kind
of
discretion
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
have
and
has
had
for
a
number
of
years
in
framing
remedies
for
discrimination
cases
under
that
statute.
it
has
been
noted
that
the
remedial
provisions
of
this
act
were
to
some
extent
modeled
after
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
is
always
been
considered
under
that
statute,
that
the
restoration
of
seniority
for
discharged
employee
is
a
part
of
his
reinstatement,
was
an
available
remedy,
usually
they
ought
to
reach
without
prejudice
to
seniority
all
other
rights
and
privileges
previously
enjoy
it
or
some
similar
wording
and
a
similar
remedy
has
frequently
been
framed
for
employees
who
had
discriminatorily
rejected
for
employment.
now
we
think
that
those
remedies
were
intended
to
be
available
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
that
was
framing
the
remedy
under
title
vii,
just
as
they
were
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
we
think
though
that
the
discretion
of
the
court
still
has
an
important
role.
now
i
am
aware
of
course
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
albemarle
case,
i
am
aware
of
the
holdings
that
the
discretion
calls
for
judgment
and
not
just
inclination
and
that
it
must
be
exercised
consistently
with
purposes
of
the
statute.
we
submit
that
there
was
support
in
this
record
for
the
action
which
the
district
court
took
and
that
he
did
act
properly
within
his
discretion.
now
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals,
although
making
this
interpretation
of
section
703(h)
concluded
with
the
holding
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
withholding
this
remedy.
now,
i
want
to
refer
particularly
to
the
factual
situation
that
was
before
the
court,
there
had
been
exhaustive
discovery
before
this
case
was
tried.
these
people
were
identified
clearly
and
full
information
had
been
provided
to
the
other
parties,
about
all
of
them.
there
were
some
200
of
these
applicants
in
this
category.
they
got
all
the
documents
relating
to
them
and
had
a
full
information
about
the
company’s
action
on
each
case
including
the
reasons
advanced
by
the
company
for
the
disqualification
of
different
ones
under
the
criteria
that
the
company
was
applying.
they
had
full
opportunity
to
interview
these
people,
there
was
nothing
to
keep
them
from
it
and
i
might
say
that
answers
to
subject
when
interrogators
have
indicated
that
they
did
in
fact
interview
them
though
i
assume
they
did
not
interview
all
of
them.
two
of
them
in
addition
to
the
class
representative
himself
testified.
also
witnesses
for
the
company
testified
about
the
way
in
which
different
individuals
were
disqualified
that
were
in
this
group.
now,
the
district
court
on
the
basis
of
this
record
made
the
statement
as
part
of
the
basis
for
his
denial
of
his
relief
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
on
which
he
could
base
the
multiple
conclusions
necessary
for
an
award
of
retroactive
seniority.
also,
i
think
the
fact
that
it
makes
very
little
difference
in
this
particular
case,
under
the
facts
that
seniority
has
such
a
small
effect
among
the
road
drivers
in
view
of
the
high
rate
of
turn
over
and
also
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
very
little
by
way
of
job
benefits
that
really
depends
on
seniority.
the
main
thing
--
mr.
william
m.
pate
i
think
you
could
make
that
argument,
yes,
i
think
that
you
could,
it
would
not
make
much
difference
either
way
and
perhaps
the
argument
could
be
made
either
way
but
i
think
it
was
a
proper
consideration
for
the
district
court
although
he
did
not
--
the
court
did
not
say
that
it
was
relying
on
that
consideration
in
any
event
on
this
point.
mr.
william
m.
pate
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
addressed
itself
to
this
other
than
to
make
the
general
holding
that
i
am
talking
about
that—
mr.
william
m.
pate
well,
lets,
i
could
certainly
understand—
mr.
william
m.
pate
the
district
court
was
right
and
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion.
so
that
gives
further
support
to
the
--
mr.
william
m.
pate
i
am
not
saying
that
the
people
were
not
qualified
but
that
there
was
a
proper
basis
in
the
record
for
the
district
court’s
with
holding
in
its
discretion
of
this
remedy.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
withholding
the
remedy.
consequently,
i
say
that
their
interpretation
of
703(h)
may
not
have
been
the
same,
i
may
have
been
incorrect
but
nevertheless
they
reached
the
right
conclusion,
sustained
the
district
court
and
therefore
the
factors
which
affected
the
district
courts
discretion
would
be
material
now,
i
think.
i
might
say
also
that
i
think
that
the
discretion
under
rule
23
cd
to
control
the
issues
to
be
handled
by
a
class
action
was
an
important
factor
here.
there
had
been
no
certification
of
a
class
action
until
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
indicates
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
this
class
action
was
approved
and
certified
in
its
final
findings,
conclusions
and
decree
by
the
district
court.
he
referred
to
another
decision.
mr.
william
m.
pate
i
referred
to
--
he
referred
to
another
decision
as
given
his
reasons
more
fully
in
which
he
had
stated
that
he
wanted
to
avoid
being
inundated
by
this
mass
of
individual
claims.
so
i
would
submit
that
he
did
have
the
discretion
to
control
the
class
action
by
limiting
the
issues
that
he
was
handling
on
that
basis.
mr.
william
m.
pate
by
seniority.
by
the
grant
of
this
remedy?
mr.
william
m.
pate
it
is
not
injured
either
way
and
the
company
apart
from
the
general
interest
of
all
of
us
and
the
importance
of
the
question
has
no
specific
tangible
interest
ended
in
this
case
as
to
whether
seniority
is
granted
to
this
group
or
not,
that
is
correct.
i
want
to
say
i
have
--
mr.
william
m.
pate
that
maybe
lurking
in
the
background
mr.
chief
justice,
i
had
never
thought
of
it
as
a
possibility.
you
are
thinking
of
a
displaced
white
employee
bringing
suit
because
he
is
displaced
as
a
result
of
a
grant
of
retroactive
seniority.
mr.
william
m.
pate
let
us
go
back
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
that
kind
of
situation
has
repeated
it
self
many
times
and
it
has
never
been
urged
that
the
employee
displaced
by
the
employers
compliance
where
the
remedial
order
would
himself
have
a
claim
because
it
is
a
sort
of
reversed
discrimination
under
terms
of
that
statute.
mr.
william
m.
pate
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
pate
as
of
now
the
company
would
not
be
injured
by
it.
now,
we
have
contended
and
do
contend
that
this
part
of
the
case
is
moot
in
any
event.
because
of
the
class
representative
is
out
of
the
class
now.
he
has
no
further
stake
in
the
outcome
of
this
case
since
he
lost
his
discharge
case
which
followed
his
employment
after
he
had
originally
been
denied
for
employment
for
a
period
of
time.
mr.
william
m.
pate
this
is
a
lee
the
intervenor,
he
attacked
his
refusal
to
hire
him,
the
failure
to
hire
him
for
a
period
of
several
months
and
his
subsequent
discharge
as
being
racially
discriminatory.
he
was
sustained
on
the
refusal
to
hierarchies
but
he
was
unsuccessful
on
the
discharge
case
and
he
was
unsuccessful
on
appeal
in
the
discharge
case.
consequently
the
only
representative
of
the
class
to
which
this
part
of
the
case
relates
is
the
inovina
who
wrote
a
separate
inovina’s
complaint
and
he
now
has
no
stake
whatsoever
in
the
outcome
of
this
question
and
consequently
we
say
under
the
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
sosna
versus
utah
and
related
cases
since
this
is
not
a
question
capable
of
repetition,
while
evading
review.
that
it
dose
not
come
within
that
narrow
exception
which
this
court
talked
about
for
certain
class
actions
where
that
kind
of
question
is
presented.
mr.
william
m.
pate
the
class
members
have
a
financial
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation.
they
have
a
stake
in
the
seniority
question
as
well.
but
looking
to
the
named
parties
for
the
determination
of
this
question
of
mootness
or
question
of
case
or
controversy
under
article
3,
there
is
no
named
party
in
the
case
that
has
any
stake
in.
