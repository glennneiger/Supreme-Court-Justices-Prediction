mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
our
respondent
in
this
case
is
a
man
by
the
name
of
terry
gallagher
and
in
a
resume
of
the
facts
as
they
developed
a
trial,
he
was
tried
without
a
jury
and
the
court
found
him
guilty
in
november
of
1972
and
the
offense
was
armed
robbery
and
he
was
thereafter
sentenced
to
the
ohio
penitentiary.
at
the
time
of
the
offense
however,
gallagher
had
been
on
parole.
he
had
been
placed
on
parole
in
february
of
that
year.
his
parole
official
was
one
william
sykes
who
was
a
member
of
the
ohio
parole
authority
and
was
assigned
to
our
area.
upon
being
informed
of
the
armed
robbery,
sykes,
saying
that
it
was
part
of
his
duty
to
do
so
and
part
of
his
job,
visited
sykes
at
the
county
jail.
he
visited
gallagher
at
the
county
jail,
sorry.
now
there
are
two
visits
that
sykes
made
to
gallagher.
one
was
on
june
26th
of
1972
and
the
respondent
did
not
speak
to
him
and
failed
to
make
any
statements
whatsoever
and
there
was
no
conversation.
four
days
before
that,
however,
on
june
22nd,
the
respondent
gallagher
had
been
contacted
by
deputy
sheriffs
of
our
county
who
were
investigating
the
armed
robbery
offense
and
had
presented
him
with
a
printed
miranda
form
which
had
all
the
warnings
on
them
and
he
acknowledged
these
miranda
warnings
and
signed
the
stencil
form
that
had
miranda
on
them.
this
was
admitted
to
be
a
voluntary
act
by
him
and
that
he
fully
understood
that
he
was
signing
an
acknowledgment
that
miranda
had
been
ordered.
this
in
effect,
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
gallagher
did
not
talk
to
mr.
sykes
when
he
visited
him
the
first
time
on
june
26th.
keeping
in
mind
that
he
also
was
on
parole
and
had
not
been
in
contact
with
the
criminal
system
before
and
when
sykes
then
determined
that
in
furtherance
of
his
duty
as
a
state
parole
officer
to
go
back
and
visit
with
him
and
he
did
so
a
week
later
on
july
3rd.
now
this
was
eleven
days
after
he
had
received
his
full
panoply
of
rights
under
miranda
and
in
an
informal
conversation
at
that
time,
sykes
obtained
or
rather
heard
from
the
respondent
gallagher
of
his
participation
in
this
armed
robbery.
there
were
no
miranda
warnings
given
at
those
conversations
that
took
place
between
mr.
sykes
and
terry
gallagher
on
july
3rd.
later
at
the
trial,
the
state
called
mr.
william
sykes
as
a
witness
and
he
testified
on
behalf
of
the
state
indicating
what
gallagher
had
acknowledged
to
him
and
of
course
the
statements
were
inculpatory
and
he
further
indicated
that
he
was
not
forced
to
talk
his
parole
officer.
the
objections
were
made
at
the
time
of
trial
to
mr.
sykes'
testimony.
the
trial
court
overruled
the
objections.
the
matter
was
taken
to
our
second
district
court
of
appeals
and
in
an
unanimous
opinion
the
appellate
court
there
held
that
there
was
no
prejudicial
to
the
respondent
gallagher
and
affirmed
the
trial
court.
the
matter
then
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
our
state.
leave
having
been
granted
for
the
appeal
and
they
in
turn
found
that
the
utterances
that
were
made
by
the
respondent
to
sykes
on
july
the
3rd
were
inadmissible
because
the
parole
officer
had
failed
again
to
warn
the
respondent
of
his
rights
under
miranda
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
the
supreme
court
in
our
state
indicated
that
it
was
both.
they
did
not
use
or.
they
said
that
was
a
violation
of
rights
of
self-incrimination
guaranteed
by
section
10
article
1
of
our
constitution
and
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
it
is
a
violation
in
my
opinion
of
both
not
one
without
the
other.
it
is
a
violation
and
the
court
specifically
stated
it
was
and
the
fifth.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes,
both.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
no
sir,
because
oregon
versus
house
indicated
that
holding
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
fourteenth,
two.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
no
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
did
not
use
the
word
'or',
it
said
'and'
it
was
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
no,
we
are
challenging
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
well
it
reached
under
section
10
article
1
of
ohio
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
no,
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
because
it
makes
the
state
and
agreed
party
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
of
course
it
is
their
duty
to
apply
that.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
they
applied
it
and
also
under
the
grounds
of
the
fifth.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes,
but
we
are
also
going
under
the
jurisdictional
question
as
issued
in
oregon
versus
hass
which
indicates
that
the
state
is
an
agreed
party
for
the
purposes
of
review
to
this
court.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
i
hold
that
we
are
here
rightfully
under
the
oregon
case.
we
are
here
rightfully
under
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
stated
that
it
was
also
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
and
also
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
which
we
claimed.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
well,
u.s.
versus
deaton
also
indicated
that
they
indicated
in
their
opinion
and
“united
states
versus
deaton
certiorari
was
denied
but
it
said
that
squarely
confronts
the
precise
question”
and
there
there
held
that
the
miranda
warnings
having
not
been
given
they
predetermined
in
deciding
the
deaton
application
they
decided
that--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
they
could
not
your
honor.
it
has
to
be
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
u.s.
constitution.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
well,
i
am
not
your
honor.
we
feel
that
we
are
rightfully
here.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
that
is
right.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
well,
us
versus
deaton
indicated
that
what
was
a
federal
question.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
no,
that
it
was
only
federal
because
backs
that
up
by
holding
that
the
state
is
a
proper
agreed
party.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
it
is
oregon
versus
hass.
that
is
95
supreme
court
1215
cited
in
75.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
well,
all
this
supreme
court
of
ohio
did
was
to
cite
federal
law
and
based
on
federal
law
is
why
they
came
to
that
conclusion,
and
that
is
so
indicated
in
deaton.
deaton
is
a
federal
case
and
that
is
the
very
case
upon
which
they
rested
the
basis
and
foundation
of
their
reversal.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
my
only
answer
is
that
the
state
then
so
ordered
by
the
accused
to
his
parole
officer
became
the
vital
issue
in
the
case
under
the
fifth
amendment
upon
which
miranda
is
wholly
based.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
well,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
making
its
ruling
in
which
they
did
reverse,
indicated
in
their
finding
that
there
was
an
inherent
compulsion
in
the
parole
officer-parolee
relationship.
our
feel
and
position
is
that
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
to
be
consonant
with
the
fifth
amendment
principles
and
that
is
the
reason
we
petitioned
for
the
writ
through
this
court
and
that
is
the
basis
in
my
judgment
upon
which
it
was
granted.
now,
basically,
one
of
the
questions
involved
here
is
whether
the
principle
of
miranda
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
should
be
extended
or
not.
now,
it
was
miranda
itself
that
made
applicable
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
area
of
confessions
obtained
at
a
police
station.
and
this
had
formally
always
been
an
area
where
the
reliability
of
confessions
and
the
principle
of
voluntariness
as
developed
by
this
court,
were
fashioned
under
the
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fifth
amendment
speaks
of
compulsion
and
the
witness
may
not
be
compelled
to
testify
against
themselves
and
that
would
apply
to
the
area
of
the
courtroom.
so
when
miranda
came
out
and
said
that
to
circumvent
this
compulsion
idea
as
a
necessary
component
for
the
usage
of
the
fifth
that
the
atmosphere
was
inherently
compulsory
and
therefore
the
miranda
warnings
were
developed
in
the
famous
case
of
miranda
versus
arizona
and
that
automatically
now
creates
compulsion
when
these
statements
are
not
given.
so,
it
takes
statements
which
have
been
obtained
from
an
accused,
a
statement
which
is
purely
voluntary,
a
statement
which
is
reliable
and
truthful
and
stands
the
test
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
under
the
theory
of
voluntariness.
it
takes
it
out
of
that
area
of
the
fourteenth
and
places
squarely
under
the
fifth,
because
miranda
says
so
and
i
feel
that
this
is
really
an
arbitrary
artificial
test.
to
say
that
just
because
miranda
is
not
cited
or
there
is
a
failure
to
give
the
full
panoply
of
rights,
which
otherwise
would
be
a
voluntary
statement
without
miranda
and
now
it
becomes
a
compulsory
statement,
compelled
by
the
accused
to
be
made
just
merely
because
of
the
failure
of
given
the
warnings.
i
am
re-arguing
miranda
because
i
think
the
test
there
is
that
as
such
that
i
will
tie
it
in
in
later
goes
into
--
miranda
first
took
it
out
of
courtroom
into
the
jail
house,
where
statements
are
made.
they
then
have
indicated
our
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
we
are
now
taking
it
out
of
the
jail
house
and
we
are
putting
it
into
the
area
of
the
parole
officer-parolee
relationship
and
that
we
are
in
a
new
area
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
the
interrogation
was
in
the
jail
house.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
that
is
right.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
pardon
me.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
i
believe
in
that
case,
the
internal
revenue
agent
went
to
the
penitentiary
and
talked
to
the
individual
then.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes.
but
the
point
is
that
an
internal
revenue
agent
is
still
one
who
was
trying
to
seek
out,
trying
to
find
where
fraud
may
be
involved,
trying
to
see
whether
or
not
he
can
file
charges.
he
acts
in
the
same
capacity
as
a
policeman
does.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
he
asked
him
his
question
about
the
robbery.
they
had
a
conversation
and
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes,
that
is
right
and
we
say
that
he
was
not
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
that
is
right.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
not
at
that
particular
time,
no.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
no,
he
did
not.
this
was
his
first
exposure
as
a
witness
in
criminal
matters,
first
exposure
being
called
in
to
testify
in
any
of
his
work
as
a
parole
officer.
he
was
subpoenaed
just
hours
before
he
testified.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes,
you
will
find
that
in
our
appendix.
and
it
further
indicates
that
he
was
just
notified
hours
by
subpoena
before
he
took
the
stand.
this
was
an
unusual
incident.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
the
statement
originally
given
by
the
respondent
to
the
police
officials.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
it
was
later
suppressed.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
the
parole
officer
had
indicated
that
later.
he
was
one
of
the
officials
at
the
county
jail.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
he
just
said
he
had
a
talk
with
him
and
he
indicated
the
he
had
admitted
the
offense
and
later
when
the
suppression
statement
was
--
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
well
they
did
not
indicate
at
that
time
that
we
are
going
to
call
him
as
a
witness,
at
least
the
prosecution
did
not
until
the
statement
was
suppressed.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
that
is
exactly
right
your
honor.
yes,
it
just
became
a
matter
of
necessity
following
the
court’s
ruling
in
suppressing
the
statement
that
had
formally
be
given
when
the
officers
took
the
miranda
warning
from
him
and
he
signed
the
miranda
warning
indicating
that
he
knew
his
rights
completely
and
at
that
time
then
waived
on.
the
position,
if
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
the
position
of
perhaps
three
other
states
are
upheld
by
this
court,
then
the
question
is
what
exactly
are
we
going
to
put
in
the
way,
future
parole
officers-parolee
relationships.
now,
here
we
have
miranda
basically
referring
to
a
policeman,
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
in
some
states
they
argue
that
a
parole
officer
is
a
law
enforcement
officer.
well,
we
challenged
that
statement
because
parole
officers
are
not
in
the
field
of
general
interrogations,
in
general
investigations.
they
are
not
there
to
put
an
individual
into
the
jail.
their
job
begins
when
the
policeman’s
job
ends
and
that
is
the
way
it
should
be.
at
that
point,
it
is
the
duty
of
a
parole
officer
or
a
probation
officer
to
maintain
a
dialog
with
his
parolee,
to
maintain
a
cordial
relationship,
to
try
to
see
if
he
can
help
him
get
back
onto
the
road
where
he
will
stay
out
of
the
jail
house
in
the
future.
his
job
is
to
try
to
reform,
to
help
this
man.
now
if
we
say
that
he
is
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
therefore
come
under
miranda
and
that
every
time
he
sees
his
parolee,
we
are
going
to
put
up
a
wall
between
them,
a
wall
of
hostility
then
the
entire
relationship,
the
entire
area
of
a
parole
officer
and
a
parolee
is
endangered.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
that
is
right.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
yes,
we
feel
that
a
parole
officer
is
separate
completely
from
the
type
of
work,
from
the
background
training
he
gets
from
his
position,
as
day
as
to
night.
we
say
that
the
fact
that
he
is
authorized
to
carry
a
weapon
as
you
say
yes.
that
is
given
to
him.
there
may
be
occasions
when
his
parolee
could
be
abusive.
but
if
a
parolee
becomes
abusive,
i
say
then
that
the
parole
officer
has
failed
somewhere
and
he
knows
that,
his
job
is
not
to
make
use
of
his
weapon.
his
job
is
not
to
go
out
and
see
if
anybody
escapes
that
he
is
going
to
shoot
them
down.
that
is
a
policeman’s
job.
his
job
is
to
rehabilitate,
keep
the
individual
out
of
jail
and
not
put
him
in.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
that
is
true
in
some
of
the
states.
i
think
kansas,
missouri,
california
and
all
that.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
it
is
now
since
the
supreme
court
ruled
few
months
back.
we
also
have
that
in
the
probation
process,
statements
maybe
made
though
no
warnings
are
given.
this
is
not
a
novel
idea
that
a
parole
officer
may
talk
without
a
prior
warning.
mr.
herbert
m.
jacobson
or
not
where
there
is
a
violation
of
federal
constitutional
rights
your
honor.
texas,
florida,
if
i
may
name
a
few
states,
south
dakota,
new
york,
colorado,
they
have
all
indicated
that
no
warnings
are
required
of
parole
officers.
they
put
them
in
a
different
field.
a
parole
officer
goes
to
school
with
his
formal
training.
it
is
contrary
to
that
of
a
policeman.
miranda
has
