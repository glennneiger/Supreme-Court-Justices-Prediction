justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
problem
i
want
from
you
is
one
case
that
you
have
to
support
a
case
of
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
federal
question
as
to
whether
it
is
on
a
state
end,
federal
ground?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
want
the
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record,
that
this
is
the
first
time
he
ever
testified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
parole
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
apply
to
a
parole
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is
this,
can
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
say
nothing
more,
say
that
this
applies
miranda
rulings
must
be
given
by
parole
officers
at
all
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
we
interpret
the
constitution
of
ohio,
a
parole
officer
is
required
to
give
the
exact
same
warnings
as
the
police
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
could
it
not
say
what
i
said?
i
did
not
say
a
word
about
miranda.
i
said
the
court
says,
our
interpretation
of
ohio
law
means
that
a
parole
officer
must
give
the
exact
same
ruling,
warning
as
a
police
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
ohio
say
that
ohio
supreme
court
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
cannot
interpret
its
own
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
to
ohio
constitution
is
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
not
you.
