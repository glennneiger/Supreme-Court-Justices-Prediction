mr.
jacobsen?
unknown
speaker
i
am
looking
at
the
opinion
of
supreme
court
at
817
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
opening
sentence
is
the
question
presented
is
whether
testimony
concerning
statements
made
by
appellant
to
his
parole
officer
was
received
at
trial
in
violation
of
appellant's
privileges
against
self-incrimination.
as
guaranteed
by
section
10,
article
1
of
the
ohio
constitution
and
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
on
what
did
the
affirmative
answer
to
that
question
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
appellant's
privilege
against
self-incrimination
rest
on
a
violation
of
the
ohio
constitution,
of
the
united
states
constitution
or
on
both?
unknown
speaker
so
we
are
viewing
as
a
violation
of
both?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
the
jurors
ohio
supreme
court
hold
that
it
was
a
violation
of
both
constitutions?
unknown
speaker
then
now
you
are
out
of
court.
unknown
speaker
what
jurisdiction
do
we
have?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
when
a
state
court
decision
rests
on
both
state
and
federal
grounds,
are
we
not
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain?
do
you
feel?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
exactly
my
point,
then
you
are
out
of
court.
you
do
not
belong
here.
unknown
speaker
is
there
also
not
a
state
ground
which
reached
the
same
result
put
in
another
way?
unknown
speaker
for
purposes
of
duty
or
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
enforce
and
apply
the
ohio
constitution?
unknown
speaker
they
applied
it
here,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
did
the
court
of
ohio
felt
compelled
to
construe
its
own
constitution
the
same
as
the
federal
and
that
the
federal
cases
forced
them
to
construe
their
constitution
this
way?
i
do
not
see
any
evidence
that
has
been
into
that
effect.
just
as
justice
rehnquist
said,
if
we
reversed
here,
it
would
still
be
standing
the
judgment
of
the
ohio
court
that
this
procedure
violated
the
ohio
constitution.
we
have
no
power
to
overturn
that.
that
judgment
has
already
been
entered.
that
judgment
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
do
not
feel
too
badly
we
are
the
ones
who
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
may
i
suggest
that
perhaps
this
is
not
as
simple
as
some
of
us
might
have
initially
thought.
my
brother
brennan
read
you
that
first
paragraph,
and
particularly
the
last
clause
of
it.
but
then
the
very
next
paragraph
says,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
brief
of
appellees
cite
cases
from
other
jurisdictions
which
have
considered
this
question.
now
how
possibly
could
other
jurisdictions
have
considered
the
question
of
the
validity
of
what
happened
here
under
the
ohio
constitution.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
supreme
court
to
tell
us
whether
they
rested
that
on
the
state
constitution?
unknown
speaker
unanimously.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
jacobson.
we
confused
you
and
ourselves
sufficiently
already,
so
would
you
leave
that
a
little
bit?
i
am
familiar
with
the
syllabus
rule
in
ohio
and
i
checked
the
ohio
state
reports
and
find
that
the
syllabus
has
the
footnote,
the
head
note
as
reprinted
on
page
13,
appendix
a
of
the
petition
is
precisely
the
syllabus
as
appears
in
the
ohio
state
reports.
that
is
the
law
of
the
case.
that
is
the
law
under
ohio.
the
opinion
is
just
something
extra.
there
is
not
a
word
of
the
state
or
federal
constitution
in
that
and
indeed
in
the
italicized
language
above,
this
is
said
to
be
the
law
of
criminal
law
and
of
evidence
not
constitutional
law
at
all.
but
the
significance
if
any,
as
that
has.
unknown
speaker
the
interrogation
here
was
in
the
jail
house,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
about
a
crime.
it
was
about
a
robbery.
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
that
immediately
after
the
parole
officer
left,
a
tax
investigator
showed
up
and
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
some
tax
crime
of
his
and
he
interrogated
him
without
any
miranda
warnings
and
then
what
he
said
was
offered
against
him
in
a
tax
prosecution.
now
that
is
mathis,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
argue
well,
he
had
been
given
miranda
warnings
once
and
that
is
enough.
no
matter
who
was
interrogating
him?
that
is
one
of
your
arguments
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
he
went
to
where
he
was
in
custody.
that
is
no
question.
he
was
under
restrain.
unknown
speaker
well
yes
but
this
parole
officer
is
the
one
who
asked
this
man
about
the
robbery.
it
was
not
any
volunteered
statement.
unknown
speaker
well
but
he
asked
him
about
the
robbery
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
he
told
somebody
else
what
the
answers
were
and
namely
the
prosecution
and
they
put
him
on
a
stand.
unknown
speaker
as
the
record
show,
whether
sykes
knew
at
the
time
of
this
interview
with
the
parolees
that
he
was
likely
to
be
a
witness
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
sykes
had
customarily
testified
in
cases
involving
his
interviews
with
his
particular
parolees?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
what
the
respondent
said
to
sykes,
how
did
the
prosecution
ever
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
how
did
they
know
when
he
said
there
was
a
parole
officer?
how
did
the
prosecution
know
what
he
said
to
his
parole
officer
on
the
second
visit?
unknown
speaker
what
for?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
is
the
doubt
about
what
would
happen
then,
when
he
said
that
about
being
a
witness?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
you
call
this
officer
a
law
enforcement
officer
or
not,
we
know
he
was
a
parole
officer;
he
had
certain
law
enforcement
authority.
he
had
the
right
to
carry
a
gun
under
ohio
law.
unknown
speaker
he
has
the
right
to
arrest
the
parolee
under
ohio
law.
he
had
no
right
to
arrest
non-parolees
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
or
if
we
should
just
dismiss
the
writ
because
we
determined
that
it
was
decided
on
both
state/federal
grounds
that
would
suit
your
purposes
even
better,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
we
held
that
--
that
we
most
recognized
that
the
ohio
law,
that
the
law
of
the
case
is
the
syllabus,
we
held
so,
in
beck
against
ohio.
unknown
speaker
still
it
does
not
tell
us
anything
on
this
question,
does
it?
it
did
not
say
a
word
about
any
constitution,
state
or
federal.
unknown
speaker
it
indicates
that
this
is
a
question
so
far
as
the
ohio
supreme
court
goes,
the
law
of
evidence
and
the
law
of
criminal
law
of
ohio.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
itself
prepares
the
so-called
syllabus.
who
prepares
the
italicized
language
above
the
syllabus?
if
you
look
at
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
you
turn
to
page
13
which
is
the
first
page
of
appendix
a,
you
will
see
above
the
syllabus,
italicized
language.
who
composes
that?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
the
reporter?
unknown
speaker
or
the
editor?
not
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
syllabus
that
court
writes
and
then
an
individual
justice
writes
an
opinion,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
guess,
that
is
the
way
it
is.
unknown
speaker
they
generally
have
--
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
inadmissible
then
not
for
failure
to
give
miranda
warnings
but
for
the
misplaced
promise
of
leniency?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
returning
to
the
miranda
issue,
is
it
your
position
that
whenever
a
parole
officer
interviews
his
parolee
and
he
moves
into
questioning
that
relates
to
another
crime
that
the
per
se
miranda
rule
applies?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
no
question
whatever
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
may
have
been
entirely
voluntary,
and
not
freewill
under
the
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
it
can
also
be
your
view,
i
take
it
that
the
parole
officer
was
visiting
the
parolee
in
the
paroleeâ€™s
residence
in
an
environment
that
was
not
normally
regarded
as
cohesive?
unknown
speaker
oh!
yes,
but
it
may
be
that
you
would
say
the
whatever
the
parolee
says,
this
parole
officer
may
not
be
admissible
in
a
separate
criminal
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
let
us
suppose
that
the
only
thing
that
sykes'
testimony
was
used
for
in
this
case
was
for
revocation
of
parole,
you
would
not
suggest,
it
was
not
admissible
for
that
purpose
would
you?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
is
an
entirely
different
situation.
so
you
are
really
saying
that
a
parole
officer
needs
to
give
miranda
warnings
only
when
he
is
interrogating
in
custody
and
asking
him
about
a
separate
crime?
unknown
speaker
no,
he
said
they
were
admissible.
