chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
ohio
against
gallagher.
mr.
jacobson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
is
there
an
adequate
state
ground
for
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
you
challenge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
not
a
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
that
not
an
adequate
state
ground?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
did
apply
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
concluded
that
under
the
ohio
constitution,
this
was
the
proper
result
as
well
as
under
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
would
appear
that
the
man
who
wrote
the
syllabus
and
the
judge
who
wrote
the
opinion
did
not
talk
to
each
other
very
much
about
this
case.
they
are
the
same
people.
they
are
the
same
man
unless
it
has
changed
since
my
father
was
a
member
of
that
court.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jacobson,
is
not
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
the
final
arbitrar
of
ohio
law?
what
it
means?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
mr.
jacobson.
thank
you.
mr.
schwarz
before
you
get
on
the
way,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
did
you
file
an
oppositionâ€™s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
here?
i
do
not
have
one
and
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
your
brief
you
do
not
raise
the
question
that
ohio
has
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
ohio
constitution
and
i
suppose
that
is
because
you
are
following
the
ohio
rule,
perhaps
that
the
syllabus
is
the
controlling
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
get
an
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
here
a
copy
of
the
brief
of
respondent
posing
writ
of
certiorari.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
is
on
a
state
basis,
i
guess
you
would
say
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
no
power
i
should
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
no
jurisdiction
because
we
granted
the
writ
but
we
do
not
have
power
to
construe
the
ohio
constitution,
you
would
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
should
so
decide
and
i
emphasize
the
'if',
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
under
the
(inaudible)
holding
of
this
court
requiring
them,
requesting
them
to
state
whether
they
decided
this
on
federal
or
state
grounds
that
would
suit
your
purposes,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed
if
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
we
have
the
power
to
read
the
opinion
and
not
be
bound
by
the
ohio
rule
of
the
law
of
the
case
is
the
syllabus.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
facts
whether
he
knew
all
of
what
a
miranda
warning
would
tell
him?
i
thought
that
is
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
probing
at?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
having
had
the
warning,
why
did
he
need
another
one
if
he
knew
what
it
would
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
washed
it
out
of
his
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
aware
that
in
ohio
could
parole
be
revoked
for
the
failure
of
the
parolee
to
cooperate
with
his
parole
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
could
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assume
a
formal
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
formal
hearing
it
developed
that
he
refused
to
answer
questions
of
the
parole
officer
about
the
commission
of
criminal
act
while
on
parole
and
certainly
in
ohio,
i
would
assume
that
after
a
hearing,
parole
would
be
revoked
on
that
ground,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
your
view
that
in
the
formal
hearing
on
parole
revocation,
forget
about
another
trial
but
in
a
formal
hearing
on
parole
revocation
that
the
statements
made
by
the
subject
to
parole
officer
are
not
admissible
even
in
the
parole
hearing,
unless
he
had
a
miranda
warning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
misunderstood
your
response.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
the
bar
that
you
want
to
put
up
is
that
the
man
simply
cannot
testify
in
a
court
with
reference
to
that
trial
for
that
particular
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
74-492,
ohio
against
gallagher
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court,
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
permit
that
court
to
clarify
whether
or
not
its
judgment
relies
on
federal
law.
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
whom
mr.
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun
joined,
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
disposition
of
the
case.
