justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
only
if
a
federal
question,
if
it
we
were
to
decide
in
your
favor
on
the
federal
question
and
say,
no
miranda
does
not
require
this
and
send
this
case
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
your
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question
suggest
to
me
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
would
say,
well,
we
were
wrong
on
that
one
but
we
are
the
final
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
constitution
and
the
conviction
is
nonetheless
reverse.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
presumably
have
a
number
of
points
to
make
and
whatever
disposition
the
court
makes
of
the
matter
ultimately,
if
i
were
in
your
position,
i
do
not
believe
i
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
voluntarily
surrendering
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
be
granted
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
said
over
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
in
the
context
of
contention
that
if
a
state
court
ruled
against
the
state,
the
state
had
no
right
to
come
to
this
court
even
to
assert
that
the
state
court
had
been
wrong
on
a
federal
ground.
the
suggestion
here
made
is
that
the
state
court
did
rule
against
you
just
on
the
federal
ground
but
also
on
a
state
ground.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
supposed
if
the
statement
of
the
police
had
been
admissible
evidence,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
call
a
parole
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
an
ohio
syllabus
heading
called
constitutional
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
hold
that
the
rights
waiver
was
ineffective
for
purposes
of
even
the
police
interrogation
or
did
they
hold
that
these
man
statements
were
induced
by
a
promise
of
leniency,
those
would
be
two
quite
different
things,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
were
not
the
original
miranda
warnings
given
by
the
police
good
enough
for
the
parole
officer’s
visit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
do
not
see
how
a
promise
of
leniency
could
somehow
erase
the
effect
of
previous
warning
that
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent,
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer,
i
do
not
see
how
that
has
any
connection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assume
that
he
may
have
got
anther
set
of
miranda
warning
under
your
hypothesis?
