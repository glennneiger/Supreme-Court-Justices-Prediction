mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
do
not
believe
i
did
your
honor.
excuse
me.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir,
i
am
going
to
answer
that
right
now.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
believe
i
was
appointed
--
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
was
about
to
say,
i
believe,
i
was
appointed
and
then
i
filed
a
typed
and
xeroxed
brief
but
i
did
not
file
any
printed
type
of
response
to
that.
i
did
not
raise
the
question
of
the
fact
that
this
case
had
been
decided
on
a
state
basis
and
there
was
no
federal
question.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir.[laughter]
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
think
this
court
in
determining
that
question
has
to
consider
the
ohio.
it
is
that
the
syllabus
is
the
--
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
might
say
â€“-
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
right.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
there
is.[laughter]
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
you
mean
state
or
federal,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
assume
that
the
person
who
prints
that
in
the
ohio
bar
does
that.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
the
editor
and
not
the
court.
i
think
the
court
writes
only
the
syllabus
and
the
decision.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
think
in
this
case
that
they
were
both
written
by
the
same
person.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
thank
you
sir.
just
in
any
event
that
the
jurisdictional
question
is
resolved
in
the
manner
that
this
court
does
consider
the
case,
the
chronology
of
the
case
i
believe
there
is
a
little
bit
other
than
reported
by
the
petitioner.
the
respondent
was
in
fact
interrogated
on
june
22nd
1972
in
a
small
police
interrogation
room
by
two
detectives
and
by
a
member
of
the
probation
authority,
not
the
parole
authority
but
the
probation
authority
was
confronted
with
another
alleged
accomplice
who
had
supposedly
already
pled
guilty
to
this
charge.
prior
to
discussing
the
matter
with
the
respondent,
the
police
did
in
fact
have
him
execute
a
miranda
warning
form
and
read
them
to
him.
it
was
subsequent
to
that,
that
the
police
or
the
detectives
in
fact
obtained
statements
against
interest
from
the
respondent
and
obtained
then
by
promises
of
leniency.
as
the
record
shows,
the
police
promised
to
drop
some
20
charges
against
this
individual
or
would
not
file
20
additional
charges
which
they
could
not
prove
anyhow.
so
they
in
effect
gave
him
nothing
for
something
and
got
the
admissions.
it
was
not
until
at
the
time
of
trial
when
the
motion
suppressed
was
sustained
at
the
parole
officer
came
into
the
picture.
i
think
any
discussion
involving
this
can
only
go
back
to
the
mathis
case
and
that
case
indicates
that
any
person
who
is
one
of
the
authorities,
who
may
put
someone
in
jail
or
who
may
cause
criminal
prosecution
at
a
subsequent
time
must
in
fact
give
the
warnings
in
the
mathis
case,
of
course
it
was
the
tax
investigator
and
there
was
a
subsequent
prosecution
based
on
information
gained
while
he
was
in
custody.
i
think
the
rights
waiver
in
this
case
is
entirely
in
effective
in
any
manner
and
as
much
as
it
was
gotten
or
it
was
used
only
as
a
tool
in
obtaining
a
confession
rather
than
as
a
deterrent
to
person
incriminating
him
so.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
the
defendant
operated
under
a
promise
of
leniency
in
accordance
with
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
also
held
that.
there
was
a
promise
of
leniency
which
made
the
statements
to
the
police
officers,
the
police
detectives
inadmissible.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
that
is
correct
after
the
waiver
was
in
fact
signed
then
the
promises
of
leniency
were
made
and
it
was
subsequent
to
that,
that
the
parole
officer
made
his
first
visit
to
the
man
who
was
then
incarcerated
in
the
date
in
jail.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
because
subsequent
to
that
time,
promises
of
leniency
had
been
made
to
him
by
the
police
in
order
to
obtain
admissions
against
interest.
at
that
time,
the
promises
of
leniency
operated
to
vitiate
the
rights
waiver.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
think
the
--
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
because
that
warning
had
an
effect
then
vitiated
and
had
been
made
null
and
void
by
the
subsequent
promises
of
leniency.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
no
sir
but
i
think
the
decision
in
miranda
versus
arizona
states
that
even
if
a
lawyer
were
in
fact
arrested,
he
would
be
entitled
to
have
these
warnings
read
and
i
assume
the
lawyer
would
know
his
rights
to
have
counsel
and
remain
silent.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
it
is
my
position
that
the
connection
is
in
the
mind
of
the
person
who
has
been
given
the
promises,
having
already
made
statements
against
interest
that
he
has
no
way
of
knowing
what
would
be
kept
our
the
trial.
we
will
talk
to
this
parole
officer
and
tell
him
anything.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
under
that
hypothesis.
that
is
only
a
hypo
but
no
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
case.
having
been
made
the
promise
he
would
then
tell
this
to
his
parole
officer
because
the
parole
officer
has
the
authority,
if
he
does
not
cooperate
to
return
him
to
the
institution
or
to
recommend
that
he
be
returned.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
yes
sir,
excuse
me,
i
think
in
the
situation
it
is
even
more
important
that
the
parole
officer
gave
the
warnings
because
that
parolee
may
rely
upon
some
confidential
relationship
which
we
all
know
does
not
exist
in
the
law.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
no
sir.
no,
i
think
it
is
out
of
the
in
custodial
range
of
miranda.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
no
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
do
not
think
it
could
without
a
formal
hearing
and
some
other
justification
other
than
refusing
to
talk.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
assuming
formal
hearing
--
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
i
do
not
think
so
if
that
case
were
pending
and
ready
to
go
to
trial.
no
sir
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
no
sir.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
crimes
other
than
the
one
for
which
he
is
on
parole
and
at
which
the
officer
may
testify.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
no,
i
said
they
would
be
admissible
in
that
case.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
but
not
after
subsequent
trial
for
the
subsequent
trial.
mr.
jack
t.
schwarz
that
is
correct
sir.
thank
you.
