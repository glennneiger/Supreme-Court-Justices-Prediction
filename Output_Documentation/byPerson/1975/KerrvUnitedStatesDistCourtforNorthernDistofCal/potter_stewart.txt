justice

would
these
rulings
be
outstanding
until
they
were
overruled?
or
would
they—
or
would
they
all
be
wiped
out
after
the
three-judge
court
were
named?
justice
stewart
it
will
be
the
same
case,
with
the
same
number
and
everything,
except
just
now
three-judge?
justice
stewart
three-judge
court?
justice
stewart
or
in
any
event
they
might
well
feel?
justice
stewart
and
what
briefly
does
an
inmates’
file
contain?
consist
of?
justice
stewart
inmate
statements,
public
statements,
or
private
statements
may
just
for
the
purpose
of
that
file?
justice
stewart
you
mean
the
district
court’s
order?
justice
stewart
summer
of
1974,
then
you
went
to
the
ninth
circuit—
justice
stewart
i
mean,
i
am
for
one,
i
manage
to
allowing
you
to
finish
what
you
have
to
say
about
mootness.
justice
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
stewart
but
not—
justice
stewart
the
risk
of
delay.
now,
in
addition
to
what
you
may
or
may
not
have
ever
filed
in
a
district
court
and
apart
of
the
question
whether
not
you
or
may
not
withdraw
that.
you
have
filed
in
this
court
the
following
statement;
respondents
no
longer
seek
any
of
the
documents
which
are
the
subject
of
this
appeal.
justice
stewart
i
am
reading
in
what
you
have
signed
and
then
filed
in
this
court?
justice
stewart
if
that
is
true,
even
conditionally,
shouldn’t
we
set
aside
or
remand
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
directions
to
have
it
set
aside
the
district
court’s
order.
and
let
everything
start
from
scratch
in
the
three-judge
district
court,
which
is
now
going
to
be
convened.
justice
stewart
then
you
will
know
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
delay
or
not
going
to
be
delay,
this
would
all
be
conditional.
justice
stewart
i
read
you
what
is
your
position?
at
least
was
on
august
1st
of
this
year,
you
filed
that
and
you
have
signed
it.
rightly
mr.
bergesen,
yes
your
name
is
on
this
document.
justice
stewart
yes
of
course
it
was
august
1
--
justice
stewart
well,
what
is
that?
justice
stewart
nobody
is
responsible
for
that?
justice
stewart
but
the
intervention
of
the
three-judge
court
complicates
and
may
delay
this
even
further.
unless
that
slate
is
wiped
clean
and
you
present
this
matter
de
novo
to
the
three-judge
court?
justice
stewart
isn’t
that
fair
to
say?
justice
stewart
i
hope
you
will?
justice
stewart
whatever
ground,
that
was
a
judgment
of
the
court?
justice
stewart
there
are
plenty
of
such—
justice
stewart
yes.
