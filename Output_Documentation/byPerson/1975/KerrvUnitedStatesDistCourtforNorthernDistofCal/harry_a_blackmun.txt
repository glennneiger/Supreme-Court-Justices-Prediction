justice
blackmun
mr.
mayer,
did
the
state
ever
give
any
concrete
reasons
why
the
documents
should
be
regarded
as
confidential?
justice
blackmun
you
made
a
choice,
and
you
have
told
this
court
that
you
have
made
that
choice?
justice
blackmun
so
it
is
not
the
end
of
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bergesen,
bringing
me
back
to
one
detail.
a
request
had
been
made
for
a
three-judge
court,
now
normally
the
chief
judge
acts
promptly.
you
and
your
opponent
know
what
a
judge
chambers
has
acted
on
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
had
not.
justice
blackmun
judge
weigel
is
going
to
hear
it?
justice
blackmun
but
you
haven’t
heard
chief
judge
chambers?
justice
blackmun
when
you
make
that
statement,
is
this
routine
in
the
ninth
circuit
a
long
delay,
it
isn’t
in
some
other
circuits
that
i
know
about?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
overnight.
