but
the
chief
judge
has
still
appointed
it?
justice
thurgood

he
appointed
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
you
make
a
motion
and
the
three-judges’
agree
with
you,
and
that
it
was
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
understand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
we
just
maintain
our
stand
until
the
three-judge
court
acts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
already
stated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
we
continue
to
stay
until
the
three-judge
court
acts?
justice
thurgood

mr.
mayer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
file
available
to
anybody
outside
of
the
institution
normally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that,
but
nobody
else?
justice
thurgood

—statute
a
custom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bergesen,
do
you
think
that
the
district
court
had
the
right
to
consider
your
amended
complaint,
while
the
case
was
here
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
under
your
theory
a
three-judge
court
would
have
been
convened,
could
have
heard
this
case
and
decided
it
before
now,
and
then
will
be
based
on
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
been
back
and
forth
in
district
court,
even
if
the
case
has
been
here,
you
have
no
time,
and
told
the
district
court
what
you
are
not
telling
us
about
braving
this
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
paper
where
you
said
you
relinquish
it?
where
is
that
paper
that
you
filed
in
the
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
is
not
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
we
hold
something
moot
on
a
basis
of
a
piece
of
paper
that
is
not
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
once
he
asked
for
it
what
can
he
do
after
that?
i
don’t
think
that
the
district
judge
can
do
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
where
i
read
the
statute,
because
as
soon
as
he
files
it,
chief
justice
moves
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
been
in
a
case
that
did
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
statute
say
promptly?
chief
judge
are
promptly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
will
all
deliver
at
speed
but
promptly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
camera
could
protect
the
privilege,
doesn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
documents
in
inmate-a’s
case
points
out
that
he
informed
on
inmate-b,
i
think
somebody
needs
to
protect
inmate-a?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
that
be
done
under
your
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
if
you
do
want
to
see
it,
just
see
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
thought
you
said
you
did
not
want
to
look
at
it
in
camera,
unless
i
misunderstood—
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
first
case,
the
kerr
case,
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioners,
state
officials,
are
defendants
in
the
class
action
challenging
the
manner
in
which
prison
terms
and
conditions
and
confinement
are
assessed
at
the
state
of
california.
in
response
to
motions
for
discovery
filed
by
the
plaintiffs,
the
district
court
ordered
petitioners
to
turn,
over
to
the
plaintiffs,
a
broad
range
of
materials
including
personal
files
of
the
california
adult
authority
and
representative
sample
of
prisoner
files.
the
district
court
rejected
petitioners
arguments
that
they
should
not
be
required
to
turn
over
these
documents
without
prior
in
camera
review
of
the
court
to
evaluate
petitioners’
claims
of
irrelevancy
and
privilege.
petitioners
filed
petitions
for
mandamus
with
the
court
of
appeals
asking
that
the
discovery
orders
be
vacated.
the
petition
was
denied.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
affirm.
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
read
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
allowing
petitioners
to
have
their
requests
for
in
camera
review
reconsidered
by
having
the
privilege
asserted
with
greater
specificity
and
by
responsible
state
officials.
given
therefore
that
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
presented
the
petitioners
with
a
more
adequate
and
moderated
avenue
to
achieve
precisely
the
relief
they
seek,
in
camera
review
of
the
documents,
there
is
no
need
to
invoke
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
mandamus
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
