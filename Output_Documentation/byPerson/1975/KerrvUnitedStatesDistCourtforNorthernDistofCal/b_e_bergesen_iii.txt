mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to,
i
think
i
ought
to
begin
with
this
same
jurisdictional
matters,
but
if
your
honors,
would
indulge
me
i
would
like
to
respond
only
to
one
point
of
my
opponent
because
it
was
discussed
so
extensively
here
at
the
end
of
his
argument.
and
that
is
we
disagree
entirely
with
his
reading
of
the
effect
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion.
there
were
indeed
two
mandamus
proceedings,
there
was
one
which
was
summarily
denied
in
december
of
1974
without
opinion,
which
did
have
to
do
with
the
central
files.
but
then
came
january
of
1975,
and
this
court’s
opinion,
the
full
opinion
although
it
dealt
with
other
types
of
documents
of
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
our
position
quite
simply
is
that
is
the
law
of
the
circuit,
that
is
the
law
that
the
district
judge
is
now
bound
by
with
respect
to
whatever
type
of
documents
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
that
if,
yes,
your
honor.
that
if
they
went
back
to
the
to
the
district
court
once
the
stay,
if
the
stays
were
vacated,
then
the
district
court
would
have
to
proceed
in
conformance
with—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
the
way
i
read
the
opinion,
justice
brennan,
they
would
be
permitted
to
make
the
type
of
showing,
and
that
is
what
really
is
at
stake
here.
the
type
of
showing
that
they
ought
to
have
made,
but
didn’t
make
initially
and
which
is
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
it
may,
and
that
would
depend
upon
the
showing
that
they
would
make.
in
other
words
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
they
did
not
make
the
proper
showing,
either
to
have
the
privilege
sustain
or
to
get
in
camera
that
they
had
to
make
a
proper
showing
that
they
did
not
make
it.
but
we
would
say
that
the
opinion
binds
and,
because
the
other
mandamus
was
prior.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
what
came
here,
what
was
staid
of
course
was
just
the
discovery
orders
and
that
only
that
part
of
the
case
which
applies
to
the
discovery
orders
and
our
right
to
these
documents—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes
sir
justice
marshal,
that
is
my
position.
and
i
wonder
if
i
could
address
myself
to
the
two
questions
of
mootness
and
three-judge
court,
and
i
will
take
them
in
that
order
if
that
is
alright.
we
did
make
a
suggestion
in
late
july
after
cert
was
granted
here.
we
did
file
a
suggestion
of
mootness
because
what
happened
quite
simply
was
we
were
faced
with
a
very
difficult
decision,
either
to
postpone
this
trial
for
perhaps
a
year,
as
it
then
appeared
last
summer.
and
wait
for
what
might
happen
here
in
the
documents
that
we
might
or
might
not
get,
or
go
to
trial,
and
we
opted
for
a
number
of
reasons
finally
to
go
to
trial.
and
in
order
to
not
have
this,
as
a
reason
for
delay
below
as
it
had
been
used
below
and
to
have
to
litigate
two
cases
in
two
courts
with
the
time
expensed.
especially
when
we
saw
that
nothing
could
be
gained
here,
we
did
file
a
suggestion
of
mootness
which
this
court
of
course
put
over
until
this
hearing.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
in
that
respect
justice
brennan,
maybe
we
should
have
done
that.
we
thought
at
the
time,
we
were
foolish
i
guess,
but
we
naively
thought
that
the
trial
date
was
affirmed
that
we
were
going
to
definitely
go
to
trial.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
our
position
this
morning
that
the
intervening
events
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
months,
mean
that
in
all
candor,
we
would
say
that
if
the
trial
is
further
delayed
and
delayed
and
this
court
comes
down
with
an
opinion,
which
gives
us
the
benefit
of
the
documents,
yes
justice
brennan,
we
would
want
them.
and
so
to
get
right
to
the
point
on
mootness,
i
think
there
is
two
determinations
as
to
two
questions
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
and
make
a
proper
showing.
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mootness
turns
on
two
questions.
number
one,
is
the
trial
date
so
speculative
as
in
perhaps
the
(inaudible)
that
is
the
closest
analogy
i
can
think
of
as
to
really
not
permit
a
mootness
determination.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
in
the
district
court,
this
is
the
whole
burden
of
our
case.
they
did
not
make,
they
did
not
begin
to
make
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
they
apparently
want
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
not
have
to
make
the
showing
that
the
court
of
appeals
says
they
have
to
make,
that
is
the
only
thing
i
can
figure
out.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
that
the
district
court
was
required
without
motive
to
inspect
all
the
documents
in
camera,
that
they
could
go
in
and
say,
here
they
are
judge
we
say
they
are
confidential,
you
have
got
to
inspect
them
in
camera.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
and
that
is
the
second
issue
on
which
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
this
is
what
i
am
going
to
say
right
now.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
here
is
what
we
told
the
district
court.
we
have
told
them
from
time
to
time,
we
want
to
go
to
trial,
we
are
willing
to
go
to
trial
without
the
documents,
we
will
not
allege
on
appeal,
a
error
by
not
having
the
documents
and
i
believe
it
was
on
october
17th
i
was
advised
by
telephone.
we
filed
a
certificate
of
readiness
when
we
did
have
a
november
10
trial
date
saying
we
relinquish
all
our
rights
to
the
documents.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
that
were
irrevocable
relinquishment,
this
certificate
of
readiness,
then
it
occurs
to
me,
it
seems
to
me
the
case
would
indeed
be
moot.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
believe,
justice
marshall—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
no
sir.
it
was
filed
by
co-counsel,
and
i
am
told
by—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
we
are
not
asking
you?
i
am
not
asking
you
this
morning
to
hold
the
case
moot,
and
i
don’t
think
it
is
moot.
but
i
was
trying
to
say
in
all
candor
that
that
seems
to
me
that
the
two
operative
considerations
are
whether
our
statements
in
the
district
court,
including
the
certificate
of
readiness
is
an
irrevocable
relinquishment,
which
i
don’t
think
it
is
but
which
this
court
might
rationally
hold
it
is.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
think
so,
justice
powell,
for
this
reason.
two
things
have
happened
since
then,
first
of
all
we
had
a
pre-trial,
we
were
going
to
go
to
a
pre-trial
conference
in
which
the
court
would
issue
a
pre-trial
order
on
october
23rd
in
which
i
think
it
would
have
incorporated
that
certificate
into
the
order.
that
never
happened
because
a
couple
of
days
before
the
judge
certified
it
as
a
three-judge
court
matter.
so
everything
is
up
in
limbo
now
and
although
i
haven’t
researched
the
matter,
i
would
suspect
that
that
is
not
an
irrevocable
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
we
would
like
to
have
the
documents,
yes
sir.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
but
not
at
the
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
is
that
in
our
suggestion
of
mootness?
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
and—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well,
our—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well
that
is
not
our
position,
we—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
is
this
the,
this
is
the
july
suggestion
of
mootness?
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
believe
there
are
two
statements
about
relinquishment.
the
first
one,
as
the
other
side
pointed
out
in
their
opposition
to
mootness,
says
we
relinquish
our
right
to
these
documents
because
we
are
going
to
trial.
your
honor,
i
would
say
it
is
fair
from
the
face
of
the
document,
and
it
has
always
been
our
position.
because
we
have
always
wanted
to
document
and
we
have
always
been
successful
in
every
court
below,
and
our
right
to
the
documents.
we
have
always
made
it
clear
that
whatever
relinquishment
there
was,
was
done
because
we
thought
we
have
an
imminent
trial
date,
and-
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
now
because
we
thought
we
did,
justice
brennan,
and
it
turned
out
time
and
again
usually
at
the
urging
of
the
defendants.
the
trial
date
kept
getting
put
off
and
put
off
and
put
off
and
now
we
just
don’t
have
that
to.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
it
certainly
is
justice
blackmun,
and
it
puts
me,
i
feel
in
an
unusual
position
and
yet
at
the
same
time,
this
was
an
unusual
situation
below,
requiring
us
really
to
have
to
go
to
trial
then.
and
we
were
ready
and
we
are
ready,
and
our
evidence
is
getting
staler
by
the
day
and
the
month.
and
this
type
of
case
presents
peculiar
problems
with
stale
evidence
and
witnesses
and
interviewing
them
and
getting
into
their
files.
we
had
to
say,
last
summer,
we
will
either
wait
a
year
and
wait
on
this
decision
here
or
we
will
go
to
trial
without
the
documents
and
i
would
submit
that
is
an
unusual
and
difficult.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
that
is
right.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
think
if
this
court
has
ruled
at
the
time
that
we
have
filed
our
suggestion
of
mootness,
when
we
urged
it,
i
think
that
would
have
and
should
have
been
the
end
of
it.
but
i
think
the
intervening
events
over
which,
for
we
have
not
been
responsible.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
have
changed
the—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
not
only
the
passage
of
time
but
the
vacation
of
a
series
of
trial
dates,
the
certification
of
the
case
as
a
three-judge
case,
what
looked
liked
a
firm
trial
date
when
we
filed
that
suggestion
of
mootness.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
no.
could
i
address
myself
to
the
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
the
three-judge
court
thing.
our
position
would
be
this;
it
might
be
that
the
judge
will
withdraw
his
certification
because
we
think
it
is
incorrect
and
not
a
three-judge
court
case
or
the
ninth
circuit
will
not
appoint
it.
but
even
if
there
is
a
three-judge
court
appointed
it
would
sit
as
a
district
court
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
it
would
be
bound
by
kerr
versus
the
united
states
district
court.
i
think
the
question
that
hasn’t
come
up
yet
is
whether,
or
maybe
it
did,
whether
if
this
three-judge
court
ruling
is
retroactive
so
the
case
is
considered
always
to
have
been
a
three-judge
court
case.
then
was
the
petition
for
mandamus
which
resulted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
properly
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit,
or
ought
it
to
have
been
taken
directly
here.
and
that
in
turn
seems
a
little
clouded
by
the
recent
case
of
mtm
versus
baxley
which
indicates
that
perhaps
it
was
correctly
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit,
although
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
it
was
not.
perhaps,
a
further
question
would
arise
as
to
whether
it
is
properly
here
anyway
because
this
court
could
treat
the
cert
petition
as
the
petition
we
ought
initially
to
have
filed
here.
i
don’t
pretend
to
have
the
answers
but
those
seem
to
be
some
of
the
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
am
sorry,
chief
justice.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well
our,
if
that
were
correct,
i
feel
that
i
would
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
oh
certainly,
justice
brennan.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
oh
yes
it
would,
but
i
don’t
feel—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
oh
yes
it
would
get
rid
of
everything
and
we
would
have
a
clean
slate.
but
with
the
intervening
events
i
don’t
think
that
i,
although,
i
don’t
think
that
i
can,
i
think
with
respect
to
my
obligation
to
my
clients,
continue
my
request
for
mootness.
i
think
that
i
have
to
say
that
the
intervening,
unless
this
court
holds
that
the
previous
events
make
it
moot,
i
no
longer
as
i
stand
before
you
today.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes
we
are,
we
are—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
if
this
court
affirms
on
the
grounds
given
in
the
court
below
opinion,
yes
that
is
precisely.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
but
in
the
alternative
we
are
also
arguing
that
this
court
could
properly
affirm
the
discovery
orders
of
the
district
court
as
being
proper
in
and
of
themselves.
in
which
case
then—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
oh
yes—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
that
is
correct,
but—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
but
i
think
justice
white,
we
would
be
entitled
to
it
on
the
doctrine
that
this
court
can
affirm
the
court
below
on
any
ground
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
see,
well
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
precisely,
technically
we
would
be
claiming
that
the
affirmance
here
would
be
of
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
mandamus.
then
the
court
could
put
that
affirmance
on
any
ground
it
wanted,
and
since
we
fully
briefed
and
argued
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
proposition
that
the
district
court
orders
were
correct—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
justice
white.
and
if
this
court
affirms
on
that
ground
then
they
would.
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
denial
of
mandamus
on
the
ground
of
the
discovery
orders
were
correct—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
but
we
didn’t
necessarily—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
oh
yes.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well,
if
it
had
been
placed
on
the
ground
that
the
discovery
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
then
we
would
have
without
more
the
documents,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
no,
i
don’t
know
justice
blackmun.
the
last
i
know
he
had
not?
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
indeed
there
is
a,
we
have
argued
to
the
judge
that
that
was
not
correctly
certified
and
he
is
going
to
hear
further.
this
has
been
briefed
and
he
is
going
to
hear
on
november
20th,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
ought
to
withdraw
his
certification.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
not
yet.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
wouldn’t
he
have
the
power
justice
marshall,
to
withdraw
his
certification
if
he
believes
it
was
improvidently
filed?
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
sometimes
there
is
a
long
delay
though,
your
honor,
between
the
certification
and
the
action.
and
since
it
is
jurisdictional,
i
would
think
he
would
be
required
to
withdraw,
it
if
he
were
convinced
that
it
were

justice
blackmun,
i
don’t
think
it
is
overnight
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
i
don’t
know
what
generally
is
the
case.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
but
you
see,
right.
justice
marshall,
our
position
is
that
the
second
amendment—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
when
we
filed
our
second
amended
complaint,
it
is
our
position
that
nothing
in
that
complaint
that
was
not
in
the
original
complaint
required
a
three-judge
court.
and
that
defendant
seized
upon
the
filing
of
a
second
amended
complaint
to
raise
the
three-judge
court
issue,
which
has
not
merit
in
our
view,
and
i
will
not
speculate
on
motives
but
certainly
the
affect
of
that
have
been
furthered
delayed
when
we
have
continued
to
want
to
go
to
trial.
if
it
pleased
the
court,
perhaps
i
could
make
some
of
my
remarks
which
go
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
perhaps
the
best
way
to
go
to
the
heart
of
this
case
is
to
consider
two
somewhat
separate
but
absolutely
inter
related
matters.
first
there
is
the
obligation
of
a
trial
judge
to
make
and
informed
determination,
in
situations
whereas
here
a
government
agency
claims
the
qualified
privilege
for
official
information.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
judge
wiegel's
protective
order
expressly
requires
us
to
get
their
consent
before
we
look
at
their
files.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
among
the
class.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
but
even
though
they
are
the
class
of
plaintiffs
we
still
have
to
get
their
written
consent
and
have
been
doing
that.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
oh
no,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
well
they
are
all
members
of
the
plaintiff
class.
now
here
of
course
the
defendants
claim
that
the
district
judge
abdicated
that
obligation
by
refusing
to
look
at
these
documents
in
camera.
but
secondly,
that
the
obligation
of
an
agency
resisting
discovery
to
submit
a
proper
claim
and
to
make
a
specific
showing
in
the
district
court
that
those
documents
do
in
fact
come
in
within
the
governmental
privilege.
now
our
position
can
be
stated
quite
simply.
of
course,
the
district
judge
has
the
obligation
to
make
an
informed
determination,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
he
can
make
that
informed
determination
only
if
the
party
resisting
discovery,
the
government
agency
which
has
complete
custody
of
the
documents,
makes
the
type
of
detailed
showing
which
the
cases
require
and
which
they
did
not
even
attempt
in
the
district
court.
and
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
questions
asked
from
the
bench
to
my
opponents
this
morning,
what
the
files
contain,
what
sort
of
documents
are
they,
what
sort
of
harm
could
come.
those
are
precisely
the
things
that
the
district
judge
needed
to
know,
precisely
the
facts
that
the
resisting
party
was
obligated
to
give
him
and
exactly
the
detailed
showing
that
the
resisting
party
here
refused
to
make.
in
other
words,
the
requirement
that
a
resisting
party
make
a
strong
showing,
the
documents
are
privileged,
it
is
not
a
mere
technical
requirement—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
premised
on,
i
believe
all
of
the
discovery
rules
justice
brennan,
we
put
the
burden
on
the
resisting
party.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
to
show
that
there
is,
for
example
a
privilege,
regardless
of
what
device
is
used.
moreover,
we
put
these
defendants
on
notice
right
at
the
beginning
of
this
case,
in
our
rule
37
papers.
that
they
had
to
make
a
proper
claim
by
the
agency
head
that
they
had
to
make
a
specific
showing,
but
this
they
never
did
throughout
the
entire
litigation
in
the
district
court.
for
example,
in
the
district
court,
these
defendants
failed
in
the
first
instance
to
give
the
judge
any
idea
of
the
dimension
of
the
problem,
how
many
documents
were
involved.
failed
to
submit
a
formal
claim
by
the
agency
head,
after
personal
considerations
setting
forth
considered
agency
policy.
failed
to
even
identify
the
specific
documents
involved
for
the
discovering
party
or
for
the
court,
failed
to
separate
the
documents
into
privileged
to
non-privileged
portions
and
then
correlate
their
claim
of
privilege
to
those
portions.
failed
to
spell
out
the
specific
harm,
which
would
be
caused
if
these
documents
were
produced
subject
to
the
protective
order,
which
judge
weigel
carefully
drew,
and
failed
to
show
why
the
protective
orders
recommended
by
the
magistrate
and
adopted
by
the
judge
would
not
be
effective.
and
indeed
at
one
point,
between
the
time
when
the
magistrate
recommended
a
protective
order
that
would
limit
the
inspection
of
the
documents
to
anyone
in
our
office.
the
other
side
suggested
that
it
ought
to
be
changed
to
be
limited
to
two
counsel
and
two
investigators
and
judge
weigel
entered
an
order,
to
one
investigator
excuse
me,
limiting
it
to
two
counsel
and
two
investigators.
therefore
the
obvious
irony,
as
well
as
the
fundamental
legal
deficiency
of
defendants
claim
here
of
judicial
abdication
is
that
it
was
their
refusal
to
follow
the
law
and
to
provide
the
district
judge
with
the
information,
he
needed
which
created
this
situation
about
which
they
now
complain.
now,
at
this
point,
in
the
analysis
the
defendants
would
disagree.
they
would
say,
they
would
point
to
their
persistent
request
in
the
district
court
that
the
judge
inspect
these
documents
in
camera,
and
their
subsequent
insistence
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
that
his
refusal
to
do
so
constituted
an
abdication
of
his
responsibility.
now,
to
most
people
including
some
lawyers
and
perhaps
even
judges,
an
in
camera
inspection
sounds
like
a
reasonable
way
to
make
an
informed
equitable
determination
of
this
type
of
dispute.
however,
a
moment’s
reflection
will
show
that
there
are
at
least
three
serious
problems
inherent
in
any
in
camera
inspection.
problems
which
the
defendants
and
the
district
court
did
not
even
acknowledge
much
less
attempt
to
cure
and
they
are
first
it
is
a
serious
problem
obviously.
not
only
on
the
trial
court
but
on
the
appellate
court
to
go
through
however
many
documents
maybe
involved.
secondly,
by
all
but
eliminating
the
adversary
process
an
in
camera
inspection
bravely
discovered
the
prejudice
of
the
discovering
party.
and
thirdly,
this
is
of
crucial
importance
in
our
view,
in
a
rule
34
litigation
situation
unlike
a
freedom
of
information
at
case,
the
judge
cannot
know
at
the
discovery
stage
what
documents
or
what
portions
of
what
documents
are
relevant
to
the
plaintiffs’
case
because
he
doesn’t
know
such
crucial
things
as
what
information
plaintiffs
have
in
other
depositions,
who
the
witnesses
are
going
to
be,
what
they
need
to
impeach
the
witnesses
with
and
so
forth.
so
after
you
look
at
it
for
a
while,
you
see
that
it
is
a
very
typical
problem.
now,
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
lower
federal
courts,
especially
the
dc
circuits
which
gets
most
of
these
request,
in
the
case
of
vaughn
vs.
rosen
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
others
is
beginning
to
require
even
in
the
foia
cases,
a
detailed
breakdown
of
the
documents
separating
them
out.
showing
which
portions
are
privileged
and
which
are
not,
cross
referencing
the
claims
of
the
privileged
to
those
portions
allegedly
non-disclosable
in
this
situation
and
setting
forth
an
evidentiary
basis
for
this.
now,
clearly
if
this
happens,
this
is
necessary
in
order
to
decrease
the
burden
on
the
court
and
in
order
to
give
a
maximumly
fair
chance
to
the
discovering
party.
and
what
we
ask
is
that
if
this
court
reaches
that
issue,
because
after
all,
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
its
limited
modest
holding
was
that
these
defendants
hadn’t
made
the
proper
showing
in
the
district
court
and
indeed
upon
remand
they
still
have
that
opportunity.
if
this
court
affirms
on
that
ground,
it
may
or
may
not
discuss
the
requisites
for
an
in
camera
inspection,
and
our
request
is
that
if
this
court
reaches
that
issue
and
discusses
in
its
opinion
that
question,
that
it
give
concern
to
the
very
real
problems
of
in
camera
inspection,
not
just
the
general
ones
experienced
by
any
freedom
of
information
act
by
the
plaintiff,
but
the
additional
much
more
difficult
naughty
ones
experienced
by
a
litigant
in
a
rule
34
situation
who
is
seeking
these
documents.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well,
the
problem
there
justice
marshall,
is
that
the
qualified
governmental
privileges
requires
the
district
judge
to
balance,
the
harm
that
would
come
from
disclosing
these
documents
against
the
need
for
the
plaintiffs
of
the
documents
in
the
litigation.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
wouldn’t
disagree
with
that
at
all.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well,
we
would
designate
a
file;
they
would
look
through
the
file
and
say
here
are
these
three
documents.
document
number
one,
is
privileged,
and
needs
to
be
protected
from
disclosure
because
it
has
in
it
the
name
of
an
inmate
who
informed
on
another
inmate.
now
if
that
were
done,
the
plaintiffs,
the
discovery
party
might
very
well
say
we
have
no
interest
in
that?
we
don’t
want
to
see
that
document?
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
no,
then
they
would
have
made
a
proper
showing,
they
would
have
carried
their
burden
and
the
district
judge
either
would
uphold
the
privilege
or
look
at
the
document
in
camera.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
no,
our
position
justice
marshall,
is
that
of
course
there
is
a
place
for
in
camera
inspection,
but
it
is
not
for
a
resisting
party
to
say
it
is
all
privileged,
we
demand
in
camera
inspection
and
here
are
he
documents.
we
are
not
going
to
show
you
anymore
showing,
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
anymore
help,
we
are
not
going
to
give
the
discovering
party
any
more
of
a
chance
to
participate
in
the
process.
that
is
what
we
are
objecting
to,
the
failure
of
the
resisting
party
to
make
a
proper
showing,
which
would
reduce
the
burden
on
the
court,
and
make
the
adversary
process
work.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
what
they
might
have
done,
because
the
other
side
makes
much
of
it
they
have
this
morning,
and
they
make
much
of
it
in
their
reply
brief.
their
position
is
that
with
the
central
files,
unlike
other
documents,
they
have
no
time
to
look
through
and
make
a
submission
to
the
court,
but
this
is
the
chronology
of
events
that
had
to
do
with
the
central
files
and
it
is
all
in
the
record.
we
in
following
the
district
court’s
order
saying
we
have
a
right
to
see
these
inmates’
central
files.
on
september
27th,
this
is
at
appendix
page
529,
we
designated
28
files
we
wanted
to
see,
not
until
october
9th,
did
we
actually
show
up
to
look
at
them.
during
that
time
the
other
side
made
no
motion
to
go
into
court
to
say
here
are
the
documents
we
think
are
privileged
and
why,
to
make
any
showing
whatsoever,
they
simply
withheld
them
from
us.
they
said,
despite
the
court’s
order,
you
can't
look
at
them.
so,
we
had
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
again,
we
filed
a
motion
on
october
21st,
this
is
page
446
of
the
appendix,
there
were
a
whole
series
they
filed
two
submissions
in
opposition,
and
at
no
time
made
the
type
of
showing
that
they
ought
to
have.
indeed
as
late
as
november
20th
they
filed
a
counter
motion,
this
is
at
appendix
at
590,
trying
to
get
the
judge
once
again
to
reconsider
and
say
that
these
documents
were
confidential.
and
now
this
is
almost
two
months
after
we
first
designated
the
files
and
still
and
all
this
time
they
haven’t
gone
into
the
district
court
and
made
the
kind
of
submission,
and
made
the
kind
of
showing,
even
with
respect
to
these
inmates’
central
files
that
they
say
everything
moved
so
rapidly
on.
and
parenthetically,
we
wouldn’t
object
to
a
procedure
below
following
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion,
whereby
even
with
respect
to
the
central
files.
we
will
designate
them,
there
is
a
time
interlude,
they
can
come
in
and
make
the
proper
showing.
the
one
thing
we
won't
vie
and
the
one
thing
the
ninth
circuit
wouldn’t
vie
is
just
this
blanket,
conclusary
claim
of
privilege
with
no
showing
that
helps
the
court,
and
now
showing
that
makes
the
adversary
process
work
and
permits
an
informed
decision
to
be
made
by
the
judge.
with
respect
to
the
qualified
privilege
for
official
information
as
to
whether
the
discovering
parties
need
for
the
documents
in
the
litigation
outweighs
the
harm
that
would
come
from
their
disclosure.
now,
i
am
so
unaccustomed,
your
honors,
to
terminating
my
argument
before
the
time
is
up.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
do
not
believe,
i
have
to
look
at
the
cert
petition,
i
guess,
they
certainly
they
haven’t
argued
with
any—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
the
magistrate,
the
district
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals,
each
one
of
them
after
a
hearing
held
these
documents
to
be
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
of
this
litigation.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
them
and
i
have
even
written
them
down—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
it
is
not
to
pass
upon,
it
is
not
to
pass
upon
their
confidence,
your
honor,
so
much
as
--
what
you
have
is
a
fair
unique
situation
with
the
parole
board.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
not
so
much
as
to
determine
what
due
process
safeguard
must
surround
these
hearings.
in
this
regard,
let
me
invite
your
honors
attention
to
a
very
recent
article
by
a—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
which
one?
there
are
three
sets,
your
honor?
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
yes,
the
personnel
files,
the
extreme
indeed
the
unique
power
and
discretion
given
to
a
parole
board
is
usually
premised
upon
the
fact
that
these
individuals
have
tremendous
expertise.
not
possessed
by
you
and
me,
and
therefore
due
process
safeguards
really
would
be
out
of
place
in
these
parole
hearings.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
no,
your
honor.
and
we
distinguished
in
our
brief
the
many-many
distinctions
between
federal
courts
and
federal
judges
bound
by
rules,
they
do
not
make.
bound
by
rules
of
evidence,
required
to
proceed
in
open
court
on
the
record
with
all
parties
represented
by
counsel
and
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
we
wanted
to
show
two
things.
first
of
all
as
judge
finley
suggests
in
a
recent
law
review
article,
there
may
well
be,
or
there
should
be
a
connection
between
the
impartiality
of
the
hearing
officer
and
the
due
process
safeguards
that
are
required.
we
intend
to
show
through
these
files
among
other
things,
that
many
of
these
hearing
representatives
and
members
are
former
correctional
officials,
are
former
police
officials
who
even
arrested
some
of
the
--mr.
chief
justice
may
i
leave
the
record
for
just
a
minute,
i
think
my
opposing
counsel
did
that.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
well
let
me
make
a
hypothetical,
if
we
could
show
justice
white,
that
a
parole
board
member
as
a
los
angeles
police
captain,
arrested
an
inmate,
was
punched
in
the
nose
by
an
inmate,
later
went
on
the
adult
authority
and
sat
on
that
inmate’s
case
and
told
him,
you
ain’t
ever
getting
out
of
here
as
long
as
i
am
on
the
board.
i
think
that
this
court
and
any
court
would
agree
that
maybe
certain
due
process
safeguards
like
perhaps
a
right
to
disqualify
for
bias,
which
we
asked
in
our
complaint
would
be
required.
now
how
do
we
make
that
kind
of
showing?
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
precisely,
and
our
second
amended
complaint
also
alleges
that
the
indeterminate
sentence
is
unconstitutional
in
part
because
we
claim
that
the
assumptions
always
made
about
parole
board
members
that
they
can
predict.
that
based
on
the
materials
before
them
or
the
prison
programs
that
the
prisoners
take
part
in,
they
can
predict
who
will
recidivate
and
who
can
not.
we
are
going
to
prove
that
they
can
not
in
trial,
or
we
are
going
to
try.
and
we
believe
that
we
can
show
that
the
expertise
which
is
often
said
to
underlie
--
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
we
might
have
expert
witnesses—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
i
am
not
sure
i
followed
you
justice
white,
on
the
sampling—
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
in
part
the
file
may
well
represent.
but
let
us
take
an
example
of
a
parole
board
member
who
writes
a
denial
based
upon
x,
y
or
z,
and
based
upon
this
he
says
i
predict
that
there
will
be
recidivism.
and
let
us
say
that
our
expert
witness
comes
on,
our
psychiatric
witness
and
says
that
is
absolutely
invalid.
you
cannot
predict
by
x,
y
or
z
recidivism
or
dangerousness.
if
you
did
enough
of
that
sort
of
thing,
you
see
our
problem
below
justice
white;
we
have
purposely
structured
this
case
so
as
that
we
would
have
to
make
a
detailed,
painstaking,
evidentiary
showing
that
among
other
things
is
the
assumptions
popularly
and
consistently
held
by
many
people
including
the
judiciary
about
parole
boards
are
in
fact
untrue,
and
the
only
way
we
can
do
that
is
by
making
a
painstaking
day-by-day,
evidentiary
showing
in
the
teeth
of
a
lot
of
popular
wisdom,
which
in
our
opinion
is
absolutely
untrue
which
invalidates
the
parole
board
an
indeterminate
sentence
in
california.
mr.
b.
e.
bergesen,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
take
issue
with
the
word
efficacy.
our
intent
is
to
show
that
the
procedures
are
so
defective
and
so
lacking
in
evidentiary
integrity
that
they
must
be
surrounded
by
greater
due
process
safeguards
than
are
presently
afforded.
that
the
xiv
amendment
requires
that,
because
as
this
court
said
time
and
again
what
due
process
is
required
in
any
situation
depends
on
the
situation,
and
we
want
to
make
an
evidentiary
showing
to
show
what
this
situation
really
is
as
opposed
to
what
is
popularly
assumed
to
be.
thank
you.
