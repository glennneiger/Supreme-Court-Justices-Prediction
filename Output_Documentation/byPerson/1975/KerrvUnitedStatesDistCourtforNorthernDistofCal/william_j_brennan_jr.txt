justice
jr.
mr.
mayer,
may
i
ask,
did
this
case
go
to
trial?
justice
jr.
it
did
not.
justice
jr.
so
this
issue
is
still
alive,
i
had
the
impression
of
(inaudible)
the
purposes
of
the
final
hearing.
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
(inaudible
)that
if
a
three-judge
court
is
convened,
then
you
would
be
at
liberty
to
renew
the
motion
made
before
the
single-judge
and
denied
by
him,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
well
know,
what
are
those
motions?
those
are
motions,
what?
to
what?
in
respect
to
the—
justice
jr.
but
we
don’t
know
that?
justice
jr.
but
i
take
it
if
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
and
if
that
would
be
denied,
i
take
it
the
state
may
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
i
gather
this
is
documentation
before
the
parole
board
when
they
are
considering
whether
he
should
be
released
on
parole?
justice
jr.
at
that
junction,
at
the
boards
hearing,
the
prisoner
has
no
attorney?
justice
jr.
in
other
words,
a
determination
would
be
made
by
the
parole
board
whether
or
not
to
release,
in
part
at
least,
i
have
some
instances
entirely
upon
the
contents
of
the
prisoners
file?
justice
jr.
--
document?
what
is
before
the
district
judge,
will
not
all
have
the
prison
documentation
--
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
when
the
board
is
fixing
the
sentence,
is
this
after
a
hearing
at
which
the
prisoner
is
present
before
the
board?
justice
jr.
and
so
at
that
time
do
the
board
and
the
prisoner
together
examine
the
contents
of
the
file?
justice
jr.
the
prisoner
is
aware
of
everything
that
is
in
the
file?
justice
jr.
and
that
would
be
what?
informants,
confidential
informants’
statement?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
of
every
20
years,
or
something
like
that?
justice
jr.
selected
at
random
i
gather?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
no
provisions
for
in
camera
examination
by
the
judge?
justice
jr.
was
it
suggested?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
this
certainly
would
indicate,
on
the
face
of
it,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
you
have
the
advantage,
both
of
the
privilege
and
in
any
event
to
seek
in
camera
inspection.
justice
jr.
and
was
this
before
the
court
of
appeal,
before
the
district
judge
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
jr.
so
i
gather,
mr.
mayer,
you
could
have
gone
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
but
you
weren't
satisfied
what
the
court
of
appeals
gave
you
say
a
petition
here,
is
that
it?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
is
this
the
review
of
the
mandamus
denial?
justice
jr.
both
are.
justice
jr.
--
you
suggest
would
have
not
applied
to
the
inmate
files,
but
only
the
personnel?
justice
jr.
this
opinion
is
written
on
that
case
--
justice
jr.
being
that
the
outstanding
orders
or
prior
modification
out
of
conform
with
this
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you
would
not
be
entitled
to
anything?
as
to
which
a
privilege
was
determined—
justice
jr.
and
all
which
involves
also
in
camera
inspection?
justice
jr.
why
mr.
bergesen,
did
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
those
circumstances?
perhaps
ask
first
for
lifting
the
stay
for
the
purpose
to
ask
if
the
orders
be
resented,
if
you
no
longer
want
the
benefit
of?
justice
jr.
well
do
you
or
don’t
you
want
the
benefit
of
the
orders
now?
justice
jr.
you
would
not
want
them
except
under
the
conditions
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
laid
down,
namely
that
the
state
may
assert
privilege
and
perhaps
as
for
in
camera
inspection.
justice
jr.
because
they
aren’t
conditioned
then?
justice
jr.
and
you
think
we
do?(laughter)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
isn’t
that
correct
--
when
we
vacate
a
federal
case
as
moot,
we
wipe
out
everything
below.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
get
rid
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
district
court’s
order.
justice
jr.
well
if
we
don’t
hold
you
to
it,
to
your
august
one
submission,
then
are
you
here
defending
the
judgment
and
supporting
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
which
the
state
has
appealed?
justice
jr.
if
you
are
and
we
affirm,
then
anyway,
this
whole
business
has
to
go
back
to
allow
the
state
proved
privilege,
or
that
there
ought
to
be
in
camera
inspection.
justice
jr.
well
that
is
what
i
just
asked
you.
whether
you
were
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
its
opinion?
justice
jr.
then
i
should
think
we
would
have
to
set
aside
that
sentence
that
mr.
justice
powell,
directed
your
attention
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
justice
jr.
this
is
an
argument
from
the
26(b)
is
it?
justice
jr.
yes.
