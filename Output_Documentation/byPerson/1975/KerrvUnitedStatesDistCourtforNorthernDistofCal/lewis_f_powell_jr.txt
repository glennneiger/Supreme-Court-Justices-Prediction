mr.
mayer.
justice
jr.
i
wish
you
would
clarify
for
me
the
status
of
the
demand
for
these
documents
you
said,
and
the
brief
state,
that
the
plaintiffs
below
were
willing
to
waive
their
demand
for
the
documents.
has
that
waiver
been
withdrawn?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
mr.
mayer.
justice
jr.
i
have
before
me
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
petition
for
certiorari,
index(a),
page
13,
i
would
like
to
read
one
sentence,
have
you
follow
me
and
then
relate
it
to
your
argument.
the
sentence
is,
in
the
only
full
paragraph
on
page
is
roman
13,
beginning
to
last
sentence
in
that
paragraph,
since
there
maybe
information
--do
you
have
that?
justice
jr.
since
there
maybe
information
in
the
requested
documents
which
should
be
protected,
the
petitioners
may
assert
a
privilege
to
a
particular
document
or
class
of
documents,
and
perhaps
seek
in
camera
inspection
at
the
time
the
documents
are
discovered
in
the
district
court.
now,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
were
making
no
blanket
objection
to
these
documents
that
the
state
would
be
satisfied
if
the
district
court
examined
each
one
of
them,
in
camera,
before
they
were
used
in
the
trial.
does
that
sentence
meet
your
objection,
and
if
not
why?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
saying
now
that
you
withdraw
that,
that
you
may
take
the
position
you
may
withdraw
it
in
the
district
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
would
insist
on
the
documents?
justice
jr.
i
must
say
it
is
rare
when
a
respondent
makes
a
suggestion
of
mootness.
i
gather
it
is
rare
still
when
nobody
wants
to
disown
it?
