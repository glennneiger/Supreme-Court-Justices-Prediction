chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
its
morning
in
kerr
against
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
california
number
1023.
mr.
mayer
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
three-judge
court
has
convened
to
deal
with
these
issues,
then
is
there
any
case
for
decision
here?
if
the
same
district
judge
who
tried
it,
district
judge
weigel,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
is
the
judge
--
when
you
clarified
that,
has
he
requested
the
designation
of
a
three-judge
court
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
three-judge
court
that
is
designated
has
reasonably
assumed
that
he
will
or
ought
to
vacate
his
judgment
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
indicated
that
judge
weigel
had
already
certified
it
to
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
as
a
three-judge
court
case,
isn’t
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
counsel
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
suspect
that
one
of
the
things
to
be
considered
on
the
november
28th
hearing
is
whether
the
district
judge
had
any
jurisdiction
and
has
any
jurisdiction
to
do
anything
in
this
case,
since
it
is
pending
here?
what
authority
has
he
got
after
this
court
has
granted
the
writ
here
to
deal
with
the
case
at
all,
except
in
a
purely
ministerial
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
think
you
perhaps
better
address
yourself
now
to
the
main
arguments
rather
than
this
exploration
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
jurisdiction
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
initial
use
of
that
file
by
the
adult
authority
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
the
sentence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judge
does
not
sentenced
in
california—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
in
accordance
with
law,
and
then
the
adult
authority
makes
the
decision
from
that
point
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
file
then
roughly
comparable
to
the
file
before
a
united
states
district
judge,
for
example,
in
making
a
sentence
after
he
has
the
pre-sentence
report?
chief
justice
burger
has
he
modified
his
order
ever
since
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
retain
jurisdiction
to
modify
an
order
would
be,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
not
charged
you
the
time
when
we
interrogated
you
about
this
jurisdiction
matter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
get
a
white
light
of
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
required
to
use
all
your
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
bergesen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
accept
your
outstanding
invitation
there
wouldn’t
be
any
court
of
appeal’s
opinion
to
bind
the
three-judge
court,
will
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
accept
your
outstanding
invitation
proper
to
declare
this
case
moot.
does
that
not
vacate
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion
and
the
three-judge
court
would
deal
with
this
matter
de
novo?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
he
do
anything
until
he
hears
from
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
you
should.
and
we
have
enlarged
your
time
enough
to
cover
this,
but
as
was
suggested
before
that
you
can
use
all
of
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
privilege
of
the
states?
what
about
the
privilege
of
these
individual
200
prisoners,
not
to
have
their
files?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
200
that
are
in
the
class
but
they
are
not
all
named
plaintiffs,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
plaintiffs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
supreme
court
of
california,
would
you
think
you
were
entitled
to
the
biographical
background
of
all
the
members
in
order
to
see
whether
they
were
qualified
to
make
the
more
important
judgments
that
they
make?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
cannot
tell
until
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
go
out
of
the
record
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
entirely
you
are
confined
to
the
record
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ferguson,
if
you
were
the
chairman
of
a
committee
or
sub-committee
of
the
california
legislature,
in
outlining
a
program
of
action
of
how
you
are
going
to
proceed
in
order
to
persuade
the
legislature
to
abandon
the
adult
authority
system,
i
would
think
the
argument
you
have
made
would
be
entirely
a
valid
one.
but
you
are
asking
a
court
to
undertake
the,
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
the
california
adult
authority
system
for
sentencing
offenders,
that
is
the
what
it
amounts
to
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
you
have
anything
further
mr.
mayer?
we
can
allow
you
about
five
minutes
more.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice
warren
e.
burger

and
opinions
