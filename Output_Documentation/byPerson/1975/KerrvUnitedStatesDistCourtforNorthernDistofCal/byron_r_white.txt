justice
white
do
you
understand
the
state
wants
here
that
it
has
not
already
gotten
to
the
court
of
appeals,
namely
a
chance
to
raise
and
claim
and
justify
its
privilege
in
the
district
court?
justice
white
what
does
the
state
wants?
justice
white
they
want
us
to
hold
that
just
based
on
whatever
claim
they
made
on
the
district
court
initially
was
enough?
justice
white
if
you
would
be
then
asking
for
a
judgment
that
gives
you
more
than
you
have
obtained
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
having
cross
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
affirm
on
any
ground
but
you
can't
extend
the
rights
of
the
respondent
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave.
you
can
affirm
what
he
got
on
any
ground,
but
i
don’t
think
you
can—
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand
both
you
and
your
opponent,
i
thought
as
i
understand
you,
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
would
be
bound
by
the
ninth
circuit’s
opinion
to
permit
the
state
to
claim
a
privilege?
justice
white
de
novo,
wouldn’t
you
have
more
if
we
affirmed
here
instead
and
said
that
the
discovery
orders
of
the
district
court
were
right
initially,
the
state
has
no
privilege
and
can't
claim
a
privilege.
you
would
be
getting
more
here
than
you
got
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
well,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
white
alright,
i
don’t
see
that
you
would.
no
you
just
didn't
take
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
basically.
they
denied
mandamus
but
made
a
few
observations—
what
more
could
you
ask,
what
more
total
victory
could
you
have
in
the
court
of
appeals
than
a
denial
of
mandamus?
justice
white
--
it
maybe
dicta,
then
i
misunderstood
what
you
said.
you
said
that
the
district
court
would
be
bound
to
permit
the
state
to
claim
a
privilege
under
the
court
of
appeal’s
opinion,
is
that
right
or
no?
justice
white
is
the
question
of
relevance
open
here
though?
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
must
have
held
that—
justice
white
why
did
you
want
it
up
here?
is
there
one
easy
answer
or
there
are
lots
of
them?
justice
white
is
it
to
pass
upon
the
confidence
of
the
state
officials?
justice
white
is
it
to
pass
upon
so
that
the
court
could
make
some
judgment
in
how
they
have
performed
their
duties
in
the
past?
justice
white
(inaudible)
justice
white
what
did
you
want
these
records
for?
justice
white
(inaudible)
your
argument
would
be
that
you
might
show
his
personal
file,
is
that
the
possibility
of
bias,
