justice
rehnquist
(inaudible)
from
the
amended
complain
that
the
plaintiffs
filed
the
claim
of
the
three-judge
court?
justice
rehnquist
would
all
the
issues
be
automatically
be
referred
to
the
three-judge
district
court
or
just
those
which
require
the
convening
of
the
court
of
the
first
instance?
justice
rehnquist
under
the
plaintiffâ€™s
complaint
before
it
was
amended
last
summer,
no
one
made
any
contention
that
there
was
need
for
a
three-judge
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it,
mr.
mayer,
from
the
part
of
your
brief
pages
64,
65,
and
66,
that
one
of
your
contentions
is
that
in
weighing
that
type
of
an
approach,
the
fact
that
the
state
owns
these
documents
and
the
state
itself
could
not
be
made
a
party
to
this
action
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
that
is
itself
is
a
factor
which
should
be
weighed
against
extensive
discovery.
justice
rehnquist
but
you
can
say,
i
suppose
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
the
state
nothing?
they
denied
the
petition
for
mandamus,
and
that
you
are
entitled
to
argue
in
support
of
that
denial
on
whatever
basis
you
want.
