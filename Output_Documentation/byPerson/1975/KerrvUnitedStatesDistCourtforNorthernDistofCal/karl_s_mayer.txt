mr.
karl
s.
mayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
karl
mayer,
deputy
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california.
i
represent
petitioners
in
this
action,
the
director
of
corrections
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
chairman
and
members
of
the
california
adult
authority,
which
is
the
state
parole
board.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
no
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
there
was
a
trial
date
that
was
changed
to
november
10,
and
that
has
since
been
withdrawn
and
there
is
a
present
no-trial
date.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes
your
honor,
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
below
had
expressed
to
the
court
in
a
suggestion
of
mootness.
their
willingness
to
proceed
with
trial
without
the
documents.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
trial
date
of
september
25,
there
had
been
proceedings
in
the
district
court
since
then.
and
on
october
23,
as
i
recall,
there
was
a
scheduled
pre-trial
conference
before
the
district
court.
three
days
before
that
on
october
20,
the
district
judge
had
sent
a
notice
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
noticing
the
apparent
necessity
of
a
three-judge
court.
at
the
formal
pre-trial
conference
on
the
23rd,
as
i
recall
today,
the
topic
of
the
three-judge
court
was
again
broached.
and
there
was
some
discussion,
and
the
way
it
was
left
was
that
the
pending
trial
date
of
november
10
was
withdrawn
with
further
proceedings
on
the
three-judge
court
question,
now
scheduled
for
november
20.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
as
to
a
necessity
of
a
three-judge
court
for
the
trial
below.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes
your
honor,
the
amended
complaint
was
filed
july
1
of
this
year,
1975.
our
suggestion
of
the
necessity
of
a
three-judge
court
was
filed
some
two
or
three
weeks
after
that.
and
a
notice
has
been
pending
in
the
district
court
since
but
not
dispose
off.
and
then
october
20,
the
district
judge
did
send
the
notice
to
the
ninth-circuit,
the
three-judge
court
has
not
yet
actually
been
convened.
the
notice
of
its
necessity
has
gone
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
his
notice
to
the
ninth
circuit
read
that,
this
case
appears
to
be
a
case
requiring
a
three-judge
court,
according
and
as
best
i
can,
and
i
hereby
certify
it
to
you
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit
as
a
case
requiring
the
convening
of
three
judges.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
i
believe
that
if
the
three-judge
court
is
actually
convened,
and
the
three
judges
are
appointed
and
said
that
we
as
defendants
in
the
action
below
could
renew
our
motions
before
the
three
judges
together
for
their
consideration.
and
i
believe
that
consideration
could
be
de
novo,
and
they
could
the
three
judges
together,
could
in
effect
overrule
the
single-judge,
his
earlier
rulings.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
i
don’t
think
the
fact
of
convening
the
three-judge
court
would
irradiate
the
existing
single-judge
orders,
and
certainly
will
not
eradicate
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
i
believe
that
the
entire
case
would
go
to
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
your
honor,
the
topic
first
came
up
in
proceedings
in
the
district
court
i
believe
in
july.
and
at
that
time
there
was
an
oral
statement
in
open
court
by
counsel
for
plaintiffs
that
they
would,
would,
they
have
not
yet,
they
would
stipulate
to
withdrawal
of
their
request
for
the
documents.
they
have
not
in
fact
withdrawn
their
request
for
documents.
and
the
district
court
orders,
which
compel
their
production
are
outstanding,
as
is
the
published
the
published
ninth
circuit
opinion.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
they
are
stated
by
the
order
of
this
court.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
but
for
the
order
of
this
court
stating
the
district
court’s
orders,
is
my
understanding
that
the
orders
would
become
automatically
effective,
it
is
not
my
understanding
--
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
well,
basically
these
were
motions
in
opposition
to
the
motions
to
compel
discovery.
i
would
think
until
our
motions
are
made
we
would
also
have
to
ask
the
three-judges’
to
stay,
the
single-judge’s
order.
we
asked,
we
had
to
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
get
status
of
the
judge’s
orders,
he
was
not
willing
to
state
them
on
his
own.
and
i
would
not
think
there
would
be
any
different
result
if
we
were
asking
the
three-judges’
to
review
the
single-judges’
order.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
no,
i
don’t,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
your
honor,
on
the
top
of
my
head
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
would
be
an
appeal
or
a
writ,
petition
for
mandamus.
yes
sir,
we
would
seek
review
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
except
that
on
november
20,
there
are
further
proceedings
before
judge
weigel
upon
his,
where
he
will
reconsider
his
notification.
and
i
believe
he
contemplates
that
at
that
time,
either
withdrawing
or
not
withdrawing
the
notification.
the
three-judges
as
i
say
have
not
yet
actually
been
appointed.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
excuse
me.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
no,
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
guess
a
problem
in
my
head
is
this,
if
the
question
is
before
this
court,
as
to
whether
the
other
two
judges
of
the
three-judge
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
orders
in
the
first
instance.
this
court
has
stated
the
single-judge
district
court’s
order.
now
as
long
as
the
case,
and
those
questions
are
now
before
this
court,
i
would
feel
the
improper
for
the
other
two
judges
and
the
single-judge
who
also
be
considering
--
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
or
they
might
well
feel
that
way,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
i
would
think
if
this
court—
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
i
would
think
as
your
honors,
said
this
in
a
minute
order
or
something,
then
the
three-judges
would
feel
perhaps
more
free
to
do
that?
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
a
question
that
i
am
uncertain
about.
the
distinction
is
this,
is
that
the
certiorari
has
been
granted
as
to
interlocutory
discovery
orders.
and
we
have
searched
but
have
not
found,
expressed
authority
that
would
state
that
such
a
limited
grant,
a
certiorari
grant,
to
a
limited
part
of
the
case
would
also
state
the
entire
proceedings
below.
i
think
judge
weigel
believes
that
it
is
not
improper
for
him
to
consider
these
other
matters.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
petitioners
come
before
the
court
very
basically
because
the
district
court
has
granted
indiscriminate
demands
for
documents.
indeed
the
demands
are
for
entire
categories
of
documents,
they
are
state
government
documents,
and
the
documents
are
of
conceded
confidentiality.
in
doing
this,
the
district
court
did
not
look
at
a
single
document
in
question,
although
the
petitioners
offer
to
present
them
to
the
court
for
that
purpose
prior
to
their
disclosure
directly
to
the
adversary.
also
in
doing
this,
the
district
court’s
order
of
december
three,
the
order
affecting
the
contents
of
inmate
files
was
not
only
precipitated
without
the
judge
having
seen
the
documents,
but
is
effectively
a
prospective
order,
which
requires
the
petitioners
to
produce
the
entire
contents
of
any
inmates
file
that
is
designated
by
plaintiffs
in
the
future.
up
to
a
number
of
200
files,
some
20
to
30
files
have
been
designated
leaving
approximately
170
inmates
whose
names
can
be
picked
at
will
by
counsel
for
plaintiffs.
they
have
not
yet
been
picked.
when
picked
under
the
district
court’s
order,
we
must
turn
that
entire
inmates’
file
directly
over
to
the
adversary.
we
cannot
withhold
any
document
for
any
reason.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
the
inmates’
file
starts
out
with
basically
certain
documents
from
the
committing
court,
the
trial
court,
the
judgment
of
commitment,
a
probation
report,
statements
by
the
judge
and
the
district
attorney
and
defense
counsel
as
they
exist.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
they
are
private
statements
for
the
purpose
of
the
file
as
to
the
judge
and
the
district
attorney.
the
statement
of
the
defense
counsel
--it
is
up
to
defense
counsel.
what
he
says
is
in
a
probation
report,
the
statement
may
also
appear
in
other
documents
which
may
or
may
not
make
it
a
public
statement.
but
basically
they
are
in
the
probation
report
which
itself
is
not
a
public
document.
then
the
inmate
goes
to
a
reception
and
guidance
center
in
there,
they
may
have
some
documents
begins
to
accumulate.
it
is
classified
as
--
he
gets
custody
classifications,
he
examined
by
a
physicians,
he
is
examined
by
--
he
is
given
psychiatric
work-ups,
he
is
tested
for
his
ability
to
read,
some
assessment
is
made
up
of
his
mental
standing.
as
he
proceeds
through
system
assignments
to
other
institutions
are
made,
and
each
of
these
steps
is
backed-up
by
papers
in
the
file.
there
is
a
copy
of
his
background
in
effect
a
wrap
sheet
of
his
prior
commitments
and
charges
to
the
normal
wrap
sheet
with
which
we
are
all
familiar.
there
are
statements,
they
are
characterized
as
a
pre-board
reports,
statements
of
a
correctional
counselor
who
knows
and
is
familiar
with
the
inmate,
and
it
is
basically
a
report
to
the
adult
authority
for
consideration
at
the
time
of
parole
consideration.
either
these
kinds
of
documents.
also
in
there
are
disciplinary
matters.
if
the
inmate
violates
a
rule
of
an
institution,
there
is
a
report
on
that,
when
he
has
his
hearing
under
the
wolf
case
there
is
a
report
of
its
disposition
of
people
who
were
at
the
hearing.
if
other
inmates
have
informed
on
this
inmate
of
one
act
or
another
that
he
has
done
which
constitutes
a
violation
of
prison
rules,
that
informant
statement
is
in
the
record.
if
relatives
and
friends
from
the
outside
write
to
the
adult
authority
or
to
the
department
of
corrections
with
comments
on
the
inmate,
those
papers
are
all
in
the
file.
basically
everything
concerning
the
inmate,
all
information
concerning
the
inmate
goes
into
one
file,
into
a
central
file,
so
called.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
no.
well,
by
outside
of
the
institution
it
is
available
to
the
adult
authority,
which
the
pro-board.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
not
normally.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
it
is
by
both,
there
are
statutes
referring
to
particular
documents,
there
is
a
custom
referring
to
the
entire,
and
department
of
regulations
referring
to
the
entire
package.
there
are
situations
where
other
people
can
see
it,
the
defense
counsel
can
see
it.
if
the
inmate
is
involved
in
a
crime,
and
he
has
a
defense
counsel,
his
defense
counsel
has
access
to
his
clients
file,
and
there
are
other
circumstances.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
the
first
--
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
it
is
that
kind
of
thing
as
much
more
extensive
because
the
information
generated
in
the
file
has
been
generated
over
a
longer
period
of
time.
also,
i
am
not
sure
all
that
is
in
the
pre-sentence
file
for
a
district
judge,
but
it
would
basically
that
kind
of
file
--
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
correct.
now,
however
the
inmate
before
he
goes
in
to
his
parole
consideration
hearing
may
himself
look
at
the
file.
and
there
are
extensive
procedures
for
the
inmate
to,
if
he
sees
something
in
the
file
that
he
feels
is
incorrect,
to
take
administrative
procedures
to
correct
it.
there
are
procedures
within
the
department
of
corrections
as
well
as
within
the
adult
authority
for
the
appointment
of
investigators—
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
they
don’t
together
examine
the
contents,
they
talk
about
the
contents.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
except
for
the
highly
confidential
items,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
it
would
be
a
confidential
informants’
statement.
the
file
often
includes
information
on
the
crime
partner
of
the
particular
inmate,
that
information,
there
is
a
strong
policy
of
not
letting
one
inmate
see
another
inmate’s
information.
that
would
be
withheld.
some
psychiatric
reports
are
not
shown
to
the
inmate
because
the
psychiatrist
feels
that
it
would
not
be
good
for
him
to
see
his
own
psychiatric
report.
your
honor,
i
wish
to
emphasize
one
very
basic
point
i
think
which
runs
through
our
whole
position
here
and
that
is
this,
the
state
is
not
attempting
to
in
effect
lockup
these
documents
for
good
that
no
one
can
see
them
or
that
the
court
can
not
see
them.
we
are
asking
for
an
only
reasonable
and
informed
evaluation
of
them
before
they
must
be
turned
over
to
the
adversary.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
documents
are
in
fact
important
to
the
plaintiffs’
case,
they
should
be
disclosed.
if
they
are
not
important
to
the
plaintiffs’
case,
in
fact
important
to
plaintiffs’
case,
they
should
not
be
disclosed.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
the
plaintiffs
initially
requested
one
of
every
20
inmates’
files.
the
court’s
order—
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
now
the
court’s
order
reads
any
200
files,
however
of
the
any
200
inmates’
files
but
they
get
the
entire
file.
there
is
a
sampling
as
to
the
identity
of
the
inmate,
but
as
to
the
documents
to
be
produced,
there
is
no
sampling,
everything
goes.
and
when
a
sense
of
probability,
it
is
in
my
mind
a
certainty
that
in
an
entire
inmates’
file
there
is
something
in
some
inmate
of
the
200
inmates’
file
that
is
highly
confidential,
and
that
is
not
in
any
way
relevant
to
the
civil
rights
action
before
the
district
court.
that
must
be
a
certainty.
and
yet
the
prospective
terms
of
this
order
require
everything
without
regard
to
its
nature
of
degree
of
its
confidentiality
must
be
turned
over
directly,
directly
to
the
adversary.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
there
is
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
it
was
suggested
and
refused.
indeed
with
respect
to
the
inmate
files,
the
petitioners
attempted,
they
could
not
look
at
any
of
the
documents
until
the
inmates’
names
were
given.
when
they
were
given
certain
documents
were
withdrawn
from
the
files,
everything
else
was
given
to
counsel
to
look
at.
the
counsel
found
this
unacceptable,
made
a
motion
for
enforcement
clarification
and
sanctions
before
the
district
court.
and
when
that
was
heard,
the
district
court
made
it
very
clear
that
by
withholding
any
documents
from
production
directly
to
counsel
was
viewed
as
boarding
on
contempt.
and
on
the
december
3
order,
subsequently
came
out
is
very
clear
in
the
court’s
explicit
language
in
there
as
to
what
must
be
provided
that
everything
must
go
directly
to
counsel.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
documents
in
the
inmate
files,
when
the
documents
were
withheld
as
to
each
inmate’s
file,
there
is
a
statement
of
confidentiality
i
believe
as
it
is
characterized
as,
and
this
appears
--
there
is
a
series
of
these
appearing
in
the
single
appendix
at
the
beginning
at
page
502.
they
are
called
confidential
case
records,
these
are
department
of
correction’s
documents.
and
in
these
is
listed
the
documents
withheld
from
each
particular
inmate’s
file
that
was
in
fact
furnished.
and
for
example,
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
the
confidential
case
record
statement
appearing
on
page
516
of
the
appendix.
it
reads,
as
characterizing
or
describing
a
document
withheld,
memo
of
june
6,
1972
identifies
name
of
informant
concerning
escape
attempt,
disclosure
with
jeopardized
safety
and
welfare
of
informant.
of
course,
below
that
is
another
document
to
which
i
had
made
earlier
reference,
cumulative
case
summary
of
crime
partner,
identifying
him
by
name.
i
can
think
of
no
clearer
statement
that
putting
the
court
on
notice
that
a
document
is
of
a
confidential
nature,
and
such
documents
we
feel
at
least
deserve
before
their
compelled
production
deserved
an
examination
by
the
court.
the
other
half
of
the
coin
of
course
is
our
position,
is
that
the
court
can
deny
in
this
case
the
discovery
without
looking
at
the
documents,
but
cannot
grant
it
without
looking
at
the
documents.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
case
in
a
district
court
is
not
a
case
of
a
single
inmate
attacking
his
parole
consideration
procedure,
where
he
needs
to
know
the
documents
considered
at
that
procedure.
the
litigation
below
is
a
general
litigation,
thereafter
these
documents,
the
plaintiffs
are
after
the
documents
as
examples,
as
something
a
basis
for
information
to
the
court
that
the
adult
authority,
the
pro-board
relies
on
information
which
is
not
always
reliable.
they
don’t
need
every
single
document
and
200
inmates’
files
to
advance
that
contention.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
have
responded
to
that
in
our
reply
brief
in
footnote
8,
and
that
response
is
this,
that
sentence
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
is
stated
in
the
mandamus
proceedings,
that
relate
to,
only
the
personal
files
and
other
confidential
writings
of
the
adult
authority.
at
the
same
time
the
court
was
considering
this
opinion,
it
also
had
before
it
the
mandamus
petition,
a
separate
petition
covering
the
inmate
files.
and
the
two
of
the
judges
that
sat
and
undecided
summarily
to
reject
the
mandamus
on
the
inmate
files,
sat
on
this
opinion
that
covered
the
personnel
files.
now,
in
the
inmate
files
case,
when
we
did
take,
and
we
did
attempt
to
withhold
a
few
documents,
to
which
i
have
just
referred
now,
the
confidential
case
records
list
of
documents
from
inmate
files.
we
have
attempted
to
withhold
them
as
a
preliminary
matter
as
soon
as
those
files
were
designated
or
first
chance
to
withhold
them.
we
did
it
a
preliminary
matter,
it
precipitated
a
motion
by
plaintiffs’
informing
the
court
that
we
were
violating
the
court’s
order,
when
the
matter
was
heard
the
district
court
said
this
is
bordering
on
contempt.
and
the
court’s
december
three
order
makes
very
clear
that
what
we
did
was
a
violation
of
the
district
court’s
order,
by
withholding
temporarily
any
documents
from
provisions
directly
to
counsel.
that
order
was
before
this
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
when
it
made
this
statement,
and
yet
resulted
in
a
summary
denial
of
mandamus.
it
was
a
more
aggravated
situation
indeed
than
the
personnel
file
situation
before
the
court
here.
the
second
problem
is
that
it
is
not
clear
what
the
ninth
circuit,
what
the
court
of
appeals
envisions
by
the
phrase
at
the
time
the
documents
are
discovered
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
orders
compel
the
furnishing
of
the
documents
directly
to
counsel.
there
is
not
a
proceeding
where
documents
are
exchanged
in
open
court,
they
are
furnished
directly
to
counsel.
and
with
a
personnel
files,
we
did
ask
in
the
district
court
for
an
in
camera
inspection,
the
contents
of
them
and
the
district
court
expressly
said
no,
furnish
them
directly
to
council.
but
we
had
already
done
that.
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
unclear
to
me
what
the
ninth
circuit
envisions
in
that
statement,
and
in
any
event,
it
certainly
would
not
apply
to
the
inmate
files,
and
the
contents
of
the
inmate
files.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
no,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
this
january
1975,
and
the
district
court’s
order
on
the
personnel
files
was
june
1974,
and
the
order
covering
the
inmate
files
was
august
12,
1974
and
december
3,
1974.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
no,
your
honor.
indeed—
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
well,
your
honor,
there
is
a
strange;
i
don’t
say
strange,
there
is
a;
i
will
say
strange,
there
is
a
strange
situation
going
in
this
case
down
there.
the
court
of
appeals
order
for
the
personnel
files
came
out
in
june
of
1974,
and
we
promptly
petitioned
for
a
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
the
district
court’s
order
was
june
1974—
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
we
went
to
ninth
circuit
for
a
mandamus.
the
ninth
circuit
ordered
that
an
answer
to
our
petition
be
filed,
and
indicated
there
and
state
the
district
court’s
order
on
the
personnel
files.
that
is
august
and
september
1974.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
we
have
already
been
to
the
district
court,
on
that
very
question—
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may
explain,
there
were
two
mandamus
petitions
going
on
at
the
same
time
before
the
same
judges
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
both
are.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
and
both
were
denied
one
with
an
opinion
and
one
without,
one
is
a
summary
denial.
the
summary
denial
is
the
more
aggravated
situation,
the
inmate
files.
the
confidential
contents
of
inmate
files
was
summarily
denied
in
december—
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
well,
that
is
the
other
mandamus
case,
the
personnel
file
case.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
now,
at
the
same
time,
the
same
court
had
before
it
the
inmate
file
case
and
summarily
denied
it,
the
more
aggravated
case.
and
for
us
to
now
go
back
and
say,
our
petition
for
mandamus
on
the
inmate
files
and
weighed
about
five
pounds
and
everything
was
before
the
court,
and
to
then
go
back
and
say
look
at
it
all
again,
when
they
have
just
got
them
looking
at
it,
weeks
before,
we
thought
would
not
be
appropriate.
i
am
sure,
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor
under
rule
26(b),
the
scope
of
discovery
in
the
district
court
is
limited
to
matters
which
are
relevant
and
not
privileged.
in
this
case,
both
factors
arouse.
the
relevance
of
the
documents
to
the
action
is
most
tenuous,
speculative
or
conjectural.
and
the
question
of
privilege
could
not
have
been
resolved
by
the
district
court
without
having
looked
at
any
single
document
which
it
ordered
to
be
produced.
now,
the
question
of
privilege
under
rule
26(b)
is
difficult.
the
rule
does
not
define
what
privilege
is,
there
is
no
statute
that
defines
what
privilege
is,
the
hope
for
it
and
the
evidence
code
failed
and
precipitated
a
case-by-case
analysis
of
it.
the
petitioner’s
position
is
that
everything,
what
privilege
means
is
not
discoverable,
nothing
more
and
nothing
less.
some
privileges
are
absolute.
in
other
words,
in
every
case
the
interest
in
preserving
confidentiality
will
supersede
any
demand
before
its
disclosure.
and
as
far
as,
i
can
tell,
the
supply
is
only
to
military
or
diplomatic
secrets.
and
with
just
about
everything
else
in
the
world,
the
privilege
depends
who
wants
it
and
why,
and
under
what
circumstances,
it
also
depends
on
what
it
is.
and
these
factors
beg
of
the
balancing
and
informed
balancing
of
the
competing
interest
involved,
and
that
is
all
the
petitioner’s
have
sought
bellow.
the
confidentiality
of
the
documents
is
not
contested
at
least
insofar
as
they
are
of
a
confidential
nature.
the
relevance,
the
need
for
the
documents
is
highly
contested.
and
we
ask
that
at
the
minimum,
the
matter
would
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court,
so
that
the
judge
may
either
deny
the
discovery
altogether
which
would
please
us
immensely
or
at
the
minimum.
look
at
the
documents
before
compelling
their
disclosure
to
the
adversary.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
s.
mayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
be
very
brief.
counsel
spoke
of
the
necessity
under
the
district
court’s
orders
for
there
to
be
consent
of
the
inmates
whose
files
are
to
be
inspected
and
that
is
true.
however,
as
of
indicated
the
files
contained
documents
persons
other
than
that
inmate.
they
contain
crime
partner
information,
they
contain
information
from
informants
against
the
inmates
whose
file
is
to
be
inspected.
that
inmate’s
consent
is
irrelevant
as
to
those
other
documents;
he
cannot
consent
to
the
disclosure
of
documents
which
he
has
not
generated.
now,
the
counsel
has
stated
here
that
we
would
have
no
objection,
if
in
the
district
court
there
was
some
showing
made
of
the
confidentiality
of
the
contents
of
the
inmate’s
files,
and
if
some
particular
document
were
withheld
and
to
be
shown
to
the
court
on
upon
a
proper
showing,
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that.
that
is
precisely
what
we
did,
that
is
precisely
what
precipitated
this
attorney’s
motion
for
enforcement,
clarification
and
sanctions.
that
is
precisely
what
precipitated,
judge
weigel
threatening
me
in
open
court
with
contempt
if
i
tried
it
again,
and
that
is
precisely
what
precipitated
the
strident
language
of
the
district
court
in
the
december
3
order.
this
was
done
and
it
was
rejected.
it
was
rejected
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
denial
of
mandamus
in
that
separate
mandamus
proceeding.
now
if
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
as
the
law
presently
stands,
we
are
in
the
same
relatively
helpless
position.
the
opinion
in
kerr
is
not
helpful,
it
is
a
denial
of
mandamus
and
nothing
more,
there
is
some
dicta
in
the
opinion
but
the
dicta
adds
nothing
to
the
state
of
the
laws
at
that
time,
these
events
began.
i
feel
with
respect
to,
particularly
the
inmate
documents,
and
with
respect
to
the
contents
of
the
personnel
files,
more
must
be
required
of
the
district
court.
the
background
and
information
to
which
counsel
has
expressed
an
interest
has
been
furnished
in
abundance
to
plaintiffs,
the
complete
work
backgrounds,
the
complete
educational
backgrounds
were
furnished
in
response
to
interrogatories
with
statements
and
documents.
each
member
of
the
adult
authority
has
been
deposed
at
length
by
plaintiffs,
the
deposition
is
focused
on
two
things;
their
backgrounds
and
their
attitudes
and
the
procedures
each
individual
follows
at
parole
consideration
hearings.
how
they
get
into
the
file,
what
they
look
at,
how
they
weigh
this,
how
they
weigh
that,
they
have
this
information
to
a
fairly
well.
and
there
is
no
excuse
to
have
demanded
everything
in
every
personnel
file,
everything
in
every
inmate
file
and
so
on.
we
submit
that
the
district
court
has
not
acted
reasonably
with
respect
to
these
documents,
again
the
confidential
nature
of
which
is
conceded
and
has
been
continuously
below.
i
will
submit
the
matters,
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
