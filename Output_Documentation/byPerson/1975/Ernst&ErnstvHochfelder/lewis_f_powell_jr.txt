justice
jr.
mr.
king,
do
you
understand
you
are
now
arguing
that
was
fraud,
a
fraud
of
ernst
and
ernst?
justice
jr.
but
in
your
interrogatory
as
you
expressly
disclaim
that
is
fraud?
justice
jr.
are
you
standing
on
that
interrogatory,
are
you
now
changing
the
course?
justice
jr.
well
then
you
are
not
charging
forward?
justice
jr.
in
this
court?
justice
jr.
so,
you
are
asking
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
allow
you
to
amend
your
complaint
to
chargeable?
justice
jr.
when
was
this
suit
instituted?
justice
jr.
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
it
has
occurred
to
you,
four
years?
justice
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
plaintiffs
admitted
lack
of
reliance
on
the
financial
statements
prepared
by
ernst
and
ernst?
justice
jr.
but
you
never
saw
the
financial
statement?
justice
jr.
and
you
agree
of
the
clients
therefore,
did
not
rely
on
what
you
contend
are
the
failures
of
ernst
and
ernst
correctly
to
audit
the
accounts
of
this
company?
justice
jr.
mr.
lassers
is
17a
before
us
on
this
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
jr.
did
you
file
any
cross-petition?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question.
one
of
the
allegations
of
the
respondents
relating
to
the
net
capital
deficit
is
that
there
was
concealment
by
ernst
and
ernst.
if
you
have
addressed
that
i
do
not
recall
it.
justice
jr.
what
is
the
total
amount
of
damages?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
respondents
in
this
case
were
customers
of
a
small
brokerage
firm
largely
owned
by
its
president
leston
b.
nay.
respondents
were
induced
by
nay
to
invest
in
a
fraudulent
security
scheme.
the
firm
went
bankrupt
and
nay
committed
suicide.petitioners
in
this
case,
ernst
&
ernst,
had
audited
firm’s
books
for
many
years
and
they
did
not
discover
the
fraud
because
nay
was
capable
to
maintain
no
records.
his
technique
included
a
rule
that
he
alone
was
authorized
to
open
mail,
addressed
to
the
firm,
to
his
attentions.
after
the
bankruptcy,
respondents
sued
the
accounting
firm
alleging
that
it
was
negligent
in
failing
to
have
discovered
nay’s
rule
with
respect
to
opening
mail.
the
theory
was
that,
if
discovered,
that
rule
should
have
aroused
the
suspicion
of
the
auditors
and
upon
investigation
the
fraud
would
have
been
discovered.
this
suit
was
brought
under
section
10b
and
rule
of
10b-5
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
reversing
the
district
court,
held
that
respondents
had
stated
a
valid
cause
of
action
for
damages,
even
though
no
negligence
had
been
alleged
--
i
have
that
a
bit
wrong
--
even
though
only
negligence
was
alleged.
there
was
no
allegation
of
fraud
and
no
allegation
of
willful
misconduct
by
ernst
&
ernst.
section
10b
speaks
of
manipulative
and
deceptive
devices
or
contrivances.
these
word
reflect
a
congressional
intention
to
proscribe
a
type
of
conduct
quite
different
from
negligence.
indeed
the
language
congress
chose
in
other
sections
of
the
securities
act
that
are
directed
to
negligent
conduct,
stand
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
language
of
10b-5.
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934
act,
as
well
as
the
overall
pattern
that
expressed
civil
liabilities
created
by
the
acts,
also
supports
the
view
that
section
10b
is
not
directed
at
merely
negligent
conduct.
for
reasons
more
fully
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reading
a
negligent
standard
into
section
10b
and
rule
10b-5.
accordingly,
we
reverse
its
judgment.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
