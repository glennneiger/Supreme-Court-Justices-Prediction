justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
berner,
is
the
term
aiding
and
abetting
a
familiar
one
to
members
of
the
security
bar?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
it
come
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
it
get
over
into
the
civil
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
respondents
had
a
couple
affidavits
of
that,
i
thought
that
the
mail
rule
would
have
sure
alerted
auditors
to
do
more
than
ernst
and
ernst
did
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
can
we
really
parse
this
kind
of
a
thing
on
when
it
is
simply
a
reversed
level
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
seventh
circuit
as
to
whether
the
affidavits
did
or
did
not
make
out
a
conflict
on
the
question
of
proper
audit
or
it
is
not
that
more
logical
to
concentrate
on
the
negligence
versus
something
more
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
allege
reckless
or
willful
misconduct
in
their
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
argue
on
this
seventh
circuit
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
or
would
be
a
trial
to
support
a
finding
of
recklessness
or
willfulness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
fact
that
at
common
law,
ernst
and
ernst
could
not
be
held
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
under
the
ultramares?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
berner,
if
the
general
rule
is
that
even
an
intervenor
is
not
allowed
to
raise
a
new
theory
in
the
case,
would
the
sec
simply
as
an
amicus
have
any
right
to
raise
a
new
theory
at
this
stage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
king
supposing
they
do
fail
to
check
into
that,
that
would
still
be
no
more
than
negligence,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
just
a
lot
of
words,
negligence,
gross
negligence,
evidence
of
fraud,
but
those
are
three
fairly
separate
things
and
i
do
not
think
it
helps
analysis
to
simply
garble
them
all
together?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
tried
--
you
are
talking
about
the
case
against
ernst
and
ernst?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
went
off
on
a
summary
judgment?
justice
rehnquist
but
it
was
your
lawsuit.
what?
justice
rehnquist
it
is
your
lawsuit.[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
got
a
claim
for
negligence
and
a
claim
for
fraud,
certainly
you
will
allege
both
of
them,
do
you
not,
you
do
not
say
negligence
is
good
enough
to
get
by
and
so
we
will
not
worry
about
fraud
even
though
we
cannot
rule
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lassers,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
which
i
should
have
asked
your
colleague
mr.
king.
is
he
the
author
of
the
leading
biography
on
chief
justice
fuller?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
the
terms
not
manipulative
and
deceptive
both
at
least
to
the
common
mind
convey
a
sense
of
intent
as
well
as
the
objective
result
of
the
actions?
can
you
negligently
manipulate
something?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
manipulative
practice
that
could
be
negligently
carried
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gonson,
how
in
this
case,
just
following
a
literal
text
to
the
rule
can
you
say
that
whatever
ernst
and
ernst
did
that
might
have
violated
sub
section
b
was
done
in
connection
with
the
purchaser
or
sale
of
any
security?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
are
taking
a
position
too
that
they
could
be
held
liable
here,
so
this
is
not
just
what
the
respondent
would
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
these
people
never
relied
on
the
statements
and
never
saw
them
apparently?
