mr.
lassers?
justice
stewart
what
do
you
suggest
the
auditors
should
have
done,
should
have
said
why
he
do
that
and
the
answer
would
have
been,
well,
because
mr.
nay
likes
to
open
his
own
mail?
justice
stewart
well,
that
would
be
the
further
investigation.
why
do
you
hold
that
mail
for
mr.
nay
while
he
is
away
on
vacation?
justice
stewart
well,
because
he
likes
to
open
his
own
mail.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
role
if
any,
do
you
think
section
17a
of
the
exchange
act
plays
or
ought
to
play?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
discussed
in
part
two
or
part
three
of
its
opinion
--
part
two
of
its
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
just
saying
that
it
was
a
statutory
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
are
going
as
i
understand
you,
you
are
a
little
beyond
meats
and
bones
of
this
case
and
talking
generally
about
what
the
rule
ought
to
be
and
it
was
in
that
connection
that
i
asked
you
a
question
what
role
if
any,
do
you
think,
what
function
if
any
do
you
think
that
section
17a
ought
to
play
in
deciding
the
question
of
civil
liability
of
accountants
to
investors
under
10b?
justice
stewart
the
statute
does
not
use
the
word
practice.
it
uses
a
device
or
contrivance.
nouns
that
are
derived
from
verbs,
from
the
verbs
device
or
contrive,
and
those
are
affirmative
verbs,
those
are
not
negligent
verbs?
justice
stewart
that
is
part
of
the
fraud.
he
was
using
first
securities.
was
that
not
as
alleged?
justice
stewart
and
this
is
an
oral
report,
was
it
not?
justice
stewart
but
the
communication
between
was
oral?
justice
stewart
but
i
think
there
is
some
point
made
at
the
fact
that
this
was
done
orally
and
not
officially
and
in
writing,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
stewart
well,
among
other
things,
i
think
it
may
be
means
oral
nature
of
it.
justice
stewart
have
a
one
way?
justice
stewart
right.
