mr.
paul
gonson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
position
of
the
sec
in
this
case,
assuming
that
the
auditor's
conduct
below
was
not
more
than
negligent,
is
that
the
judgment
should
be
rendered
for
ernst
and
ernst
and
this
is
so
on
a
very
simple
basis
because
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
respondents
here
in
their
capacity
as
escrow
investors
were
not
reasonably
foreseeable
by
ernst
and
ernst
and
as
they
concede,
they
did
not
rely
on
any
order
prepared
by
ernst
and
ernst.
we
share
with
ernst
and
ernst
then
with
the
amicus,
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants,
a
reluctance
to
expose
accounting
firms
to
potential
damages
in
vast
amounts
for
negligence
in
cases
where
it
strikes
one's
basic
sense
of
fairness
that
such
damages
should
not
be
imposed.
but
ernst
and
ernst
comes
to
this
court
in
this
quite
unusual
case
actually,
quite
an
untypical
case
and
asks
that
the
baby
be
thrown
out
with
the
bath
water.
it
asks
this
court
to
enunciate
a
rule
that
if
accepted,
would
also
bar
recovery
in
meritorious
cases,
the
more
typical
cases;
the
cases
were
a
sense
of
fairness
would
say
to
one
that
perhaps
damage
judgment
should
be
awarded.
now,
if
this
court
wishes
to
develop
such
a
broad
rule,
respecting
the
liability
of
auditors
for
negligence
then
we
have
offered
in
our
brief
in
which
i
will
speak
to
you
briefly
today,
what
we
think
is
a
sound
approach
in
doing
so.
but
in
developing
such
a
broad
rule
in
this
case,
this
court
would
then
be
called
upon
to
strike
an
appropriate
balance
between
two
important
competing
policies.
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
necessity
of
maintaining
high
professional
standards
of
accounts
because
of
their
extremely
important
role
with
respect
to
the
federal
securities
laws.
this
country
system
of
such
laws
is
dependent
on
the
disclosure,
the
integrity
of
disclosures
which
are
made
to
investors.
in
order
recognized
as
having
a
public
duty
in
that
respect
to
safeguard
the
interest
of
the
public
who
reads
their
reports,
more
so
than
an
interest
to
safeguard
the
auditor’s
client.
auditors
are
called
upon
to
certify
financial
statements
containing
the
wide
variety
of
documents
required
to
be
given
to
investors
by
public
companies
and
to
be
filed
with
the
sec.
in
many
instances,
the
opinion
of
the
auditing
firm
is
essential
before
securities
may
be
offered
to
the
public
or
placed
privately,
thus,
the
continued
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
securities
laws
of
this
country
has
to
rest
to
some
great
extent
on
the
shoulders
of
the
accounting
profession.
now,
when
i
say
this
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
auditors
are
insurers
of
the
honesty
of
their
clients.
certainly,
they
are
not
and
they
have
no
obligation
affirmatively,
but
to
seek
out
fraud,
nor
should
they
have
any
liability
of
any
kind
for
honest
professional
judgments
which
turned
out
on
hindsight
to
have
been
erroneous,
but
the
auditor
is,
in
a
peculiarly
advantageous
position
to
detect
and
to
stop
fraud
in
its
incipiency.
the
question
here
is
what
if
he
fails
to
that
through
negligence
and
investors
are
injured.
now,
we
doubt
that
this
court
would
wish
to
say
that
there
never
could
be
a
case
under
any
circumstances
under
10b-5
where
an
injured
investor
might
recover
damages
against
an
auditor
whose
professional
conduct
fell
below
the
standards
of
his
profession.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
certainly
there
are
remedies
that
are
available
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
it
could
sue
an
auditor
for
an
injunction
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
and
under
appropriate
circumstances
they
could
bring
disciplinary
proceedings
under
rule
2e
of
its
rules
of
practice.
this
court
has
recognized
in
several
cases
that
private
causes
of
action
are
an
effective
supplement
to
the
sec’s
own
enforcement
--
mr.
paul
gonson
in
this
case,
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
this
raises
a
question
to
which
of
course
justice
white
eluded
earlier
and
that
is
that
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
ruled
out
in
the
court
below
and
the
question
--
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
--
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
it
implied
that
right
of
action
could
be
created
and
beyond
there
of
course
there
would
be
the
question
whether
in
this
case
the
requirements
of
section
17a
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
this
action
that
were
met
which
is
a
separate
factual
--
mr.
paul
gonson
that
rule
of
course,
i
am
speaking
much
more
broadly
in
respect
as
to
the
order
to
broker
dealers
in
that
rule
is
of
course
the
rule
that
relates
to
the
order
of
broker
dealers
and
the
commission
has
not
prepared
a
position
your
honor
today
with
respect
to
what
rule
section
17a
should
be
playing
this
case
rather
we
are
addressing
ourselves
to
the
role
of
section
10b
and
10b-5.
now,
we
think
that
in
appropriate
balance
there
must
be
struck
between
a
sufficiently
broad
standard
of
culpability
to
reinforce
this
important
right
of
investors
to
receive
accurate
information
and
the
need
to
avoid
unfairness
to
particular
accountants
by
subjecting
him
for
damages
to
negligence
to
persons
who
do
not
rely
on
his
conduct.
now,
the
question
is
how
is
this
balance
to
be
struck?
where
should
the
court
look
to
for
guidance
to
structure
the
contours
of
an
appropriate
damage
remedy?
before
i
do
get
to
that,
i
want
to
make
two
brief
points.
first,
in
this
case,
we
do
agree
with
the
respondents
that
negligent
conduct
is
sufficient
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
10
and
rule
10b-5,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
every
negligent
violation
should
give
rise
to
a
money
damages
remedy,
thus
we
separate
ours
into
two
questions.
the
first,
is
there
a
violation
of
the
section
and
second,
what
should
the
remedy
be?
i
agree
with
mr.
berner,
ernst
and
ernst
counsel
that
the
legislative
history
on
10b
is
far
from
conclusive,
but
i
offered
to
this
court
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
phrase
“any
manipulative
or
deceptive
device
or
contrivance”
which
limits
conduct
only
to
that
which
is
done
intentionally.
indeed,
when
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
act
to
willful
conduct,
both
with
respect
to
violations
and
with
respect
to
civil
liability
for
this
violation,
it
specifically
said
so.
mr.
paul
gonson
well
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
phrase
manipulative
and
deceptive
refers
not
to
any
particular
state
of
mind,
but
rather
to
the
conduct
or
to
the
affective
conduct.
if
one
looks
at
the
phrases
that
congress
used
in
the
various
civil
liability
provisions
which
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
in
the
other
briefs,
and
when
they
wish
to
connote
conscious
or
intentional
wrongdoing,
they
use
phrases
like
this
they
said
“did
not
know”
--
mr.
paul
gonson
i
am
not
sure
what
a
manipulative
practice
that
could
be
negligently
carried
on
is,
but
i
think
i
know
what
a
deceptive
practice
that
could
be
negligently
carried
on
and
that
is
the
kind
of
a
practice
where
a
person,
through
failure
to
it
adhere
to
the
standards
of
his
profession
like
an
accountant
causes
financial
statements
to
be
deceptive
and
to
mislead
persons.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
true
your
honor.
i
would
not
disagree
with
that,
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
section
9
of
the
securities
exchange
act
in
the
subdivisions,
in
that
section,
this
is
the
section
that
deals
with
the
prohibition
against
affecting
transaction
on
the
securities
exchange
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
price
and
that
section
and
several
sub
sections
prohibit
these
practices
“for
the
purpose
of
doing
such
and
such.”
and
the
civil
liability
section
which
is
section
9e,
imposes
liability
on
the
person
who
“willfully
violate”
so
at
least
we
are
having
some
sections
an
indication
of
the
state
of
culpability
required.
we
have
in
10b
at
least
an
ambiguous
phrase
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
this
situation,
we
look
to
the
admonition
that
this
court
has
emphasized
again
and
again
that
when
the
court
is
construing
the
federal
securities
laws,
in
particular
rule
10b-5,
since
they
are
remedial
legislation,
these
laws
should
be
construed
not
technically
and
not
restrictively,
but
flexibly
in
order
to
effectuate
the
remedial
purposes.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
we
note
in
our
brief
your
honor.
we
are
now
going
to
the
question
of
remedy
as
distinguished
from
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
i
believe.
mr.
paul
gonson
i
am
saying
that
your
honor,
that
even
though
in
a
particular
case,
a
person
may
be
held
to
have
negligently
violated
the
law,
it
still
might
be
improper
to
impose
damages
--
mr.
paul
gonson
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
a
series
of
sections
that
require,
that
would
impose
liability
absolutely
without
fault
--
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
correct.
then
there
are
sections
on
the
other
hand
that
would
impose
liability
only
for
more
than
negligence,
but
there
are
a
series
of
sections
that
do
impose
liability
on
a
duty
to
discover
kind
of
theory
and
which
give
defenses
to
persons
to
show
that
they
made
a
reasonable
investigation
in
the
exercise
in
making
that
investigation
and
their
basis
on
which
to
discover
that
the
information
contained
was
false
and
misleading.
and
then
i
suppose
is
close
to
a
negligent
standard
and
we
think
that
if
in
applying
the
question
whether
damages
should
be
assessed
rather
than
deciding
on
negligence
yes
or
negligence
no,
it
is
helpful
to
look
to
the
pattern
of
civil
liabilities
that
do
exist
in
the
act
and
we
have
done
that
in
our
brief
and
we
have
extrapolated
from
them
what
we
think
is
a
very
useful
guide.
and
if
we
apply
these
principles
to
damage
actions
under
section
10b
and
rule
10b-5,
then
recovery
would
be
permitted
for
violations
which
were
committed
only
negligently
under
three
circumstances.
one,
the
defendant
knew
or
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
plaintiff
would
rely
on
this
conduct,
secondly,
the
plaintiff
did
in
fact
so
rely,
and
thirdly,
the
amount
of
the
plaintiff’s
damages
are
fairly
ascertainable.
mr.
paul
gonson
no
sir
that
is
not
this
case
and
because
--
mr.
paul
gonson
i
am
speaking
largely
to
a
possible
rule
that
this
court
if
it
desires
to
issue
on
the
subject
that
auditor
negligence
may
do.
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
applying
those
guidelines
that
the
record
would
not
justify
a
recovery
for
the
--
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
i
suppose
that
the
respondents
would
take
the
position
--
mr.
paul
gonson
oh!
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
believe
that
the
issuance
by
nay
of
these
notes
to
these
investors
was
the
issuance
of
the
security
and
i
would
think
that
upon
that
the
in-connection
phrase
probably
was
satisfied
by
the
reading
of
this
court
in
the
superintendent
case
that
this
activity
sufficiently
touches
upon.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
i
am
not
urging
for
that
result
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
in-connection
with
phrase
could
be
satisfied
by
tying
the
issuance
of
the
note
by
nay
to
the
conduct
which
covered
up
these
transactions.
mr.
paul
gonson
the
complaint
does
not
allege
negligence
nor
does
it
allege
intentional
or
reckless
conduct.
it
simply
alleges
facts.
it
alleges
that
there
is
a
failure
of
the
order
to
perform
properly.
the
issue
of
negligence
seems
to
have
arisen
later
on
the
case.
we
do
not
know.
we
were
invited
into
the
case
of
course
at
this
level
of
this
court.
we
do
not
know
whether
if
they
have
been
advised
early
in
the
game
that
they
would
have
pleaded
something
more
than
negligence.
perhaps
unwarranted
and
heedless
conduct
and
so
we
were
reluctant
even
though
we
tend
to
agree
that
judgment
should
be
for
instance
ernst
and
ernst
to
foreclose
them
from
a
possibility
of
making
that
argument
if
it
is
still
there.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
it
would
have
to
be
i
would
think
proof
that
would
establish.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
the
complaint
does
not
as
i
say
allege
any
standard,
it
simply
alleges
facts.
mr.
paul
gonson
thank
you,
your
honor.
