mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
these
cases
is
whether
rule
10b-5
is
to
be
turned
into
a
national
negligence
statute,
affecting
all
conduct
in
any
way
touching
on
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
security.
this
issue
is
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
as
whether
respondents
may
predicate
a
cause
of
action
against
petitioners
for
aiding
and
abetting
a
violation
of
section
10b
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
and
rule
10b-5
there
under,
an
allegation
and
proof
of
negligence
alone
of
whether
they
must
be
alleged
and
proved
something
more
than
negligence,
some
fraud,
some
knowledge
of
the
fraud
or
some
reckless
or
willful
conduct
tantamount
to
fraud.
there
are
three
other
issues
in
this
case
which
are
important
to
the
petitioners
and
the
respondents
as
a
disposition
of
anyone
of
them
can
dispose
of
this
litigation
and
they
are
whether.
ernst
and
ernst
as
a
matter
of
law
ordered
the
first
securities
with
all
diligence
whether
the
respondent’s
conduct
is
such
as
to
estop
them
from
bringing
their
claims
against
ernst
and
ernst
and
whether
the
respondents
can
avoid
the
bar
of
the
statute
limitations.
these
issues
of
course
are
best
under
understood
in
the
context
of
the
facts
which
briefly
are
that
first
securities
was
a
small
broker
dealer
in
chicago.
it
was
owned
by
leston
b.
nay.
the
respondents
for
many
years
were
regular
securities
customers
of
first
securities
and
as
such
in
their
regular
securities
transactions
received
all
of
the
documentary
paraphernalia
that
a
securities
customer
ordinarily
receives.
they
will
receive
purchase
and
sale
forms,
confirmation
of
sales,
accountings,
all
the
documents
that
emanate
from
a
broker
dealer.
most
or
all
of
the
respondents
were
also
friends
or
had
some
personal
or
social
relationship
with
nay
or
with
mrs.
nay
and
as
a
result
nay
was
able
to
persuade
the
respondents
to
invest
in
what
he
called
an
escrow.
he
told
them
that
he
had
befriended
a
small
loan
company
that
was
required
by
law
to
maintain
a
cash
escrow.
their
investments
would
be
perfectly
safe
and
it
paid
12%
interest
in
some
cases,
9%
in
the
other.
of
course,
the
escrow
was
fictitious
and
there
was
no
small
loan
company,
but
these
people
paid
their
funds
to
nay
by
personal
check
made
payable
to
him
personally
and
he
evidenced
the
investments,
the
escrow
investments
by
personal
notes
of
his
or
by
--
by
letters,
all
however
the
correspondence
coming
from
on
the
letterhead
of
first
securities
company.
none
of
the
transactions
involving
this
escrow
ever
were
reflected
on
the
books
and
the
records
of
first
securities.
the
respondents
conducted
all
of
their
transactions
with
respect
to
the
escrow
with
nay
personally
as
compared
with
the
transactions
they
had
when
dealing
with
first
securities
as
regular
securities
customers.
the
petitioner,
ernst
and
ernst
was
the
auditor
of
first
securities
from
sometime
in
the
middle
40s
until
1967.
the
respondents’
relationship
with
first
securities
as
regular
securities
customers
and
as
escrow
investors
began
in
the
early
40s
in
some
cases
and
continued
up
until
1968.
in
june
of
1968,
nay’s
fancy
scheme
caught
up
with
them
and
he
shot
and
killed
himself.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
shot
and
killed
his
wife
and
then
killed
himself.
that
was,
i
believe,
june
6,
1968.
the
sec
within
a
day
or
two
initiated
the
receivership
proceeding
which
is
still
pending
and
the
respondents
have
made
their
claims
in
that
receivership
proceeding,
but
in
1971,
they
sued
ernst
and
ernst
under
section
10b
and
rule
10b-5,
claiming
that
ernst
and
ernst
caused
their
loss.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
the
litigation
against
ernst
and
ernst,
there
were
a
number
of
depositions
taken
of
all
of
the
people
connected
with
ernst
and
ernst
audit,
with
the
audit
by
ernst
and
ernst.
the
documents
in
ernst
and
ernst's
possession
relating
to
the
--
their
audits
over
25
years
such
as
they
still
had
were
examined
by
the
respondents
and
then
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
and
granted
in
favor
of
ernst
and
ernst
in
the
district
court
and
the
grounds
that
ernst
and
ernst's
conduct
in
the
audits
was
blameless.
the
district
court
also
found
that
the
statute
limitations
barred
these
claims
and
found
that
the
respondents
own
conduct
acted
as
estoppel.
that
summary
judgment
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
reversed,
finding
that
there
could
be
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
ernst
and
ernst's
conduct
in
connection
with
the
audit
might
have
been
negligent
and
they
pointed
to
two
--
two
transactions,
two
types
of
conduct.
one,
it
was
the
existence
of
a
mailed
procedure
for
securities
and
the
other
one
was
an
allegation
that
they
did
not
take
regular
vacations.
with
respect
to
the
what
is
referred
to
as
the
mail
rule,
i
should
explain
that
there
was
simply
an
office
procedure
for
securities
which
provided
that
all
mail
delivered
to
first
securities,
addressed
to
an
individual
to
his
attention
or
to
him
personally
would
be
delivered
to
him,
put
on
his
desk.
nay,
being
the
owner
and
president
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
unopened,
yes
sir.
according
to
the
record
in
the
affidavit
of
john
walsh
of
haskins
&
sells,
that
procedure
existed
at
substantially
all
the
brokerage
houses,
well
most
of
the
brokerage
houses
in
chicago
at
that
time
and
probably
most
of
them
in
the
county.
nay,
however,
had
an
additional
--
additional
provision
which
restricted
anyone
else
at
the
office
from
opening
his
mail.
as
a
result
when
he
was
not
in
the
office,
his
mail
was
not
opened.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
could
create
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
ernst
and
ernst
audited
diligently
and
they
reversed
and
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
announced
a
standard
for
aiding
and
abetting
liability
under
10b-5
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
it
is
becoming
familiar.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
it
comes
from,
i
think
it
comes
from
the
criminal
law
originally.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
first
came
over
in
--
in
fischer
versus
klotz,
a
case
in
the
--
in
the
southern
district
in
the
late
60s
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
brennan
versus
midwestern
insurance,
the
seventh
circuit
adapted
the
analogy.
i
believe
it
comes
over
because
usually
an
aid
and
abettor
is
very
little
if
anything
to
do
with
the
fraud,
and
very
little
knowledge
if
any,
usually
no
knowledge
of
the
fraud,
but
it
is
a
term
where
someone
has
given
substantial
assistance
and
knowing
assistance
in
connection
with
some
wrong
and
it
has
been
imported
from
both
the
criminal
law
and
there
is
some
old
sec
administrative
decisions
which
use
the
concept,
but
it
is
--
it
is
not
a
well-known
concept
yet
in
the
securities
law.
the
standard
that
the
seventh
circuit
adapted
as
a
negligence
standard,
it
leaves
no
room
or
at
least
it
does
not
require
any
element
of
scienter,
that
is
any
element
of
knowledge
of
the
fraud
of
reckless
conduct
tantamount
to
fraud.
it
is
a
pure
negligence
standard
and
as
such
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir,
negligent
aiding
and
abetting.
i
believe
the
first
case
in
the
federal
jurisprudence,
i
am
certain
it
is
the
first
case
in
the
securities
laws
that
adapts
that
standard
that
a
person
can
negligently
aid
and
abet
a
securities
violation
under
10b-5
or
other
violations.
the
ninth
circuit
has
adapted
a
standard
which
does
not
require
the
element
of
scienter
although
the
case
in
which
they
adapted
it,
clearly
had
that
element,
but
the
majority
of
the
circuits,
the
second,
fifth,
sixth,
and
tenth
circuits
at
least,
who
have
specifically
addressed
themselves
to
the
question
have
required
something
more
than
negligence
in
terms
of
culpability
for
a
liability
in
a
private
money
damage
action
under
rule
10b-5.
those
circuits
are
correct
i
believe,
if
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
and
the
reasoning
behind
those
as
looked
at
deep
as
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
blue
chip
when
a
language
--
when
a
statute
is
being
construed
the
place
to
start
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
10b-5
speaks
of
manipulative
and
deceptive
devices.
now,
it
is
not
clear
what
that
is,
but
that
certainly
is
fraud
language.
that
is
not
blameless
language
or
negligent
language
that
talks
of
fraud.
the
rule
also
is
replete
with
words
of
fraud
and
in
fact,
professor
lass
has
commented
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
have
each
stated
that
if
rule
10b-5
is
held
to
encompass
merely
negligent
conduct
it
goes
beyond
the
mandated
section
from
which
it
draws
its
life.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
clause
b-2
in
rule
10b-5?
i
believe
that
all
of
rule
10b-5
was
draft
at
the
same
time
in
the
early
1940s
by
the
sec.
now
there
is
similar
language
in
the
investment
company
act.
the
sec
points
to
some
new
york
corporation
law
as
perhaps
suggesting
the
language.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
no,
it
does
not
and
it
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
it
does
not
have
language
as
to
fault
at
all.
it
simply
speaks
of
a
misrepresentation
or
an
omission,
but
i
believe
the
proper
view
of
the
three
clauses
of
10b-5
is
that
they
get
to
this
basically
the
same
kind
of
behavior.
in
this
court’s
case
in
capital
gains
research
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
legislative
history
of
course
is
not
conclusive.
nowhere
does
it
conclusively
say
that
section
10b
requires
something
more
than
negligent,
but
it
gets
near
to
that
because
a
reading
of
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
that
these
provisions
in
the
securities
laws
are
designed
to
get
to
dishonest
behavior.
the
phrase
is
honesty
in
the
marketplace,
high
ethical
standards,
these
phrases
permeate
the
legislative
history.
i
think
it
is
absolutely
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
these
acts
are
not
designed
to
get
to
the
competence
of
somebody,
but
his
honesty
and
the
certain
abuses
that
we
get
in
capital
gains
research
that
mr.
justice
goldberg’s
points
are
abuses
of
honesty.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
i
believe
it
deals
in
terms
of
both
affirmative
actions
and
of
omissions
and
an
omission
can
be
as
a
culpable
as
an
affirmative
action.
the
standard
which
the
majority
of
the
circuits
urge
and
which
we
support
would
not
constitute
a
retreat
to
1934
when
the
act
was
drafted.
it
would
not
require
a
retreat
to
all
common-law
elements
of
fraud
as
we
understood
them
at
that
time.
we
are
speaking
only
of
the
level
of
culpability
and
this
would
not
affect
the
direction
that
this
court
and
other
courts
that
have
taken
and
the
other
elements
which
constituted
a
10b-5
action,
elements
of
reliance,
materiality,
causation
and
the
like.
we
submit
that
requiring
something
more
than
negligence
in
terms
of
culpability
would
simply
be
a
continuation
of
the
direction
that
rule
10b-5
and
section
10b
has
been
taking
and
would
prevent
an
abrupt
change
in
direction
which
endorsement
of
the
seventh
circuit’s
opinion
would
constitute.
with
respect
to
ernst
and
ernst's
conduct,
even
if
a
simple
negligence
standard
were
permitted
for
rule
10b-5,
it
is
clear
we
submit
on
the
record
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
ernst
and
ernst
conducted
its
audit
of
first
securities
with
all
due
diligence.
ernst
and
ernst's
duty
to
audit
first
securities
was
to
audit
in
accordance
with
the
general
accepted
auditing
standards.
in
the
uncontroverted
evidence,
the
affirmative
evidence
in
this
case
is
unequivocal.
it
is
to
the
effect
that
ernst
and
ernst
conducted
its
audits
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
auditing
standards.
the
evidence
submitted
by
the
respondents
is
evidenced
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
first
securities
company
maintained
high
internal
accounting
controls,
strong
internal
accounting
controls.
but
of
course
that
is
not
the
issue
whether
or
not
the
a
company
has
strong
or
weak
internal
accounting
controls
is
not
determinative
of
whether
or
not
an
auditor
audits
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
auditing
standards.
internal
accounting
controls
arrangements
are
controls,
arrangements,
procedures
within
a
company
that
are
designed
to
ensure
that
company,
that
its
assets
and
liabilities
are
correctly
reflected
on
the
books
and
records.
and
if
a
company
has
strong
controls,
the
auditor
then
has
more
confidence
in
them
and
need
not
extend
his
procedures
unduly
to
confirm
that.
if
the
controls
are
weak,
he
has
to
engage
in
more
procedures,
but
whether
or
not
they
are
strong
or
weak
is
not
determinative
of
whether
the
auditor
audits
correctly.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
respondent
has
submitted
three
affidavits.
one
is
by
a
man
named
michael
garst
who
was
a
retired
national
bank
examiner.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well,
that
is
an
issue
that
as
i
mentioned
in
the
beginning,
the
question
of
negligence
or
not
can
also
win
this
case
for
ernst
and
ernst
and
as
a
result
at
least
in
those
terms
that
is
quite
important
for
ernst
and
ernst
and
i
believe
that
a
reading
of
the
three
affidavits
submitted
by
the
respondents
makes
it
fairly
clear
that
the
respondents,
two
of
the
three
are
auditors,
one
is
not
an
auditor,
of
the
two
auditors,
one
has
never
audited
a
brokerage
house,
but
he
is
leased
as
an
auditor
and
they
say
that
as
a
--
it
is
a
matter
of
personal
opinion
that
they
expressed
that
they
would
do,
one
says
would
employ
additional
audit
procedures
if
you
found
this
rule.
well,
of
course
he
has
not
reviewed
the
system
at
first
securities
like
the
affiance
whose
affidavits
are
submitted
on
behalf
of
ernst
and
ernst
did
and
they
know
what
the
system
was
and
they
know
what
procedures
were
there
and
as
a
result
they
say,
even
taking
into
account
the
mail
rule,
the
audit
was
conducted
with
all
due
diligence
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
auditing
standards.
the
respondent’s
affidavits
simply
say,
taking
the
mail
rule
by
itself,
they
would
consider
that
a
possible
weakness
and
they
may
do
something.
they
may
employ
additional
procedures
or
not,
but
they
do
not
get
to
the
question
and
the
question
is
did
ernst
and
ernst
audit
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
auditing
standards.
now,
even
more
than
that,
the
respondents
have
charged,
particularly
in
their
briefs
submitted
to
this
court
that
ernst
and
ernst's
conduct
could
be
considered
as
reckless
or
fraudulent.
they
charge
that
even
if
the
proper
standard
is
followed
by
this
court,
the
case
should
be
remanded
and
we
submit
that
this
is
incorrect
because
the
conduct
of
ernst
and
ernst
was
fully
disclosed,
fully
discovered,
is
fully
out
in
the
open
and
on
the
record.
it
was
on
the
record
for
the
district
court.
it
was
on
the
record
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
here
and
it
is
not
just
a
record
that
was
developed
during
this
case.
in
the
other
litigation,
related
litigation
in
which
the
respondents
were
involved
which
resulted
in
a
full
trial
under
merits,
on
at
least
three
other
appeals,
a
lot
of
information
was
developed.
in
fact,
all
of
the
items,
the
three
or
four
items
about
which
the
respondents
complain
in
their
brief,
i
mean
it
is
there
in
their
brief,
were
all
outlined
in
the
complaint
itself.
so,
this
is
nothing
new.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
no,
they
allege
that
ernst
and
ernst
knew
or
should
have
known
but
as
the
brief
of
the
hochfelder,
the
respondents
points
out,
they
never
characterized
that
conduct.
they
simply
--
they
did
not
say
it
was
simply
negligent.
they
submitted
it
the
facts
to
the
court
and
it
is
our
view
that
it
should
not
be
permitted
at
this
stage
on
the
basis
of
the
same
record
to
apply
a
few
more
adjectives
and
thus
send
the
case
back
for
another
view
of
the
same
facts
simply
with
different
adjectives
in
mind.
this
is
not
a
new
theory
they
are
proposing.
they
are
simply
proposing
that
they
are
continuing
to
propose
that
ernst
and
ernst
conduct
was
wrong.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
it
was
not
that
clear
in
the
seventh
circuit.
they
did
not
emphasize
that,
but
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
i
believe
is
quite
clear
that
no
finding
of
recklessness
or
fraud
could
be
found
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
and
the
seventh
circuit
had
stretched
some
to
find
the
possibility
of
negligence.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
that
is
correct
which
would
eliminate
a
finding
of
fraudulent
of
reckless
conduct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
no
sir,
not
direct
reliance.
in
fact,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
rely
on
ernst
and
ernst
and
on
their
audit.
they
have
never
seen
the
audit.
they
did
not
know
ernst
and
ernst.
they
did
not
know
of
them.
the
theory
as
best
i
can
make
it
out
is
that
if
ernst
and
ernst
had
audited
properly,
it
would
have
told
the
midwest
stock
exchange
and
the
sec
that
there
were
weak
internal
accounting
controls
at
first
securities.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
opening
of
the
mail.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well,
the
record
does
not
support
he
did
not
take
vacations,
but
for
the
record
is
clear
to
contrary,
but
vacations,
weak
internal
accounting
controls
and
there
are
two
other
elements.
one
was
the
fact
that
nay
borrowed
from
this
company
and
the
other
was
that
there
was
tampering
in
net
capital
violation
in
1967.
both
of
those
were
litigated
in
part
of
this
suit
below
that
was
directed
against
the
midwest
stock
exchange
and
both
of
those
were
found
to
be
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
as
not
instances
of
negligence
and
a
part
of
the
midwest.
now,
ernst
and
ernst
was
simply
to
report
those
to
the
midwest.
the
gist
of
the
complaint
as
i
understand
it
is
that
ernst
and
ernst
reported
those
informally
rather
than
formally.
i
am
not
sure
the
legal
distinction,
but
that
appears
to
be
what
it
is
and
those
are
not
audit
problems.
for
instance,
the
excessive
borrowings
are
called
by
nay,
they
were
always
less
than
the
earned
surplus.
nay
owned
the
company
and
the
amounts
he
borrowed
were
always
less
than
the
earned
surplus
of
the
company,
considerably
less.
they
were
all
reported
on
the
financial
statements
just
as
the
requisite
sec
instructions
require.
the
respondents
claim
that
the
debt
should
have
been
reserved
because
they
said
nay
was
hopelessly
insolvent.
well,
they
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
debts
were
reserved,
reserved
to
100%
under
net
capital
computations.
debts
from
an
officer
or
partner
or
director
of
a
broker
dealer
must
be
carried
as
a
zero
asset
in
determining
that
capital
and
that
was
done
in
these
instances.
so
those
are
the
other
instances
mr.
chief
justice.
so
we
submit
that
a
remand
on
the
issue
of
recklessness
or
fraud
would
be
particularly
inappropriate.
there
is
not
a
new
theory
that
is
being
urged
by
the
respondents.
they
are
merely
new
adjectives
that
are
being
applied
to
ernst
and
ernst
conduct,
the
same
conduct
that
has
been
fully
before
all
of
the
courts.
i
would
like
briefly
to
touch
upon
the
two
other
issues
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
i
think
the
commission’s
suggestion
is
improper.
the
commission’s
brief
was
filed
several
weeks
after
the
brief
of
the
hochfelder,
the
respondents
where
the
use
of
the
words
reckless
and
fraudulent
first
occurred
and
the
sec,
that
the
commission
refers
to
that
brief
and
says
perhaps
the
case
should
be
remanded.
however,
the
sec
bases
that
apparently
on
the
fact
they
believe
a
new
theory
is
being
--
maybe
argued.
we
do
not
consider
this
a
new
theory.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well,
the
statute
limitations
questions
exist
now
and
the
statute
would
be
the
same.
it
would
not
affect
the
applicable
statute.
if
i
may,
i
would
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
we
felt
that
the
suggestion
was
gratuitous
and
it
is
not
supported
by
any
case
authority
as
to
their
standing.
it
appears
on
the
last
page
of
their
brief.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
a
common
law
action,
a
10b-5
is
not
the
only
statute
or
the
only
theory
upon
which
a
plaintiff
can
proceed
in
this
case,
can
a
common
law
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
no,
only
on
10b-5.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well,
i
would
not
call
it
a
different
theory.
i
think
they
would
still
be
alleging
fraud.
they
may
have
found
to
know
another
way
to
get
at
ernst
and
ernst,
but
i
would
not
consider
that
different
theory.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
has
attracted
some
attention
as
to
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint,
what
the
theories
are
and
what
the
facts
are,
i
would
point
to
the
third
defense
of
ernst
and
ernst
in
its
answer
filed
in
this
case
which
says,
it
is
in
page
24
of
the
appendix,
in
which
statements
made
that
ernst
and
ernst
had
no
knowledge
of
any
conduct
of
nay
alleged
to
be
fraudulent
in
the
second
count,
without
such
knowledge,
ernst
and
ernst
could
not
aid
or
abet
nay’s
alleged
fraudulent
conduct.
i
believe
this
should
answer
questions
as
to
whether
the
possibility
of
proving
or
the
issue
as
to
recklessness
or
fraud
was
ever
raised
in
this
case.
it
was
raised
in
the
answer
to
the
complaint.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
my
point
is
that
when
we
--
by
this
defense
we
raise
the
issue
as
to
the
level
of
culpability
and
this
defense
tends
to
set
up
fairly
clearly
that
the
petitioner
who
was
defendant
below
would
take
the
position
that
without
some
knowledge,
some
scienter,
there
could
be
no
recovery.
this
is
in
response
to
the
discussion
as
to
whether
the
respondents
should
be
permitted
to
return
the
district
court
and
not
amend
their
complaint
as
i
understand
it,
but
simply
to
make
a
new
argument
which
we
think
is
unwarranted.
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
that
the
record
establishes
very
clearly
that
ernst
and
ernst
in
fact
did
review
the
system
of
internal
accounting
controls.
and
with
respect
to
the
mail
rule,
it
has
never
been
shown
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
evidence
which
supports
a
causable
connection,
this
issue
was
not
included
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
was
argued
below
and
to
explain
the
immateriality
of
a
mail
rule,
if
nay
had
said
to
these
people,
please
addressed
your
mail
to
me
to
lock
box
1
or
first
securities
company
lock
box
1
that
he
opened
himself,
they
would
have
done
it.
and
to
think
that
to
require
an
accountant
to
review
all
of
the
incoming
mail
of
all
of
the
officers
and
directors
of
a
brokerage
house
in
the
circumstances
as
to
think
that
is
--
that
itself
is
a
derogation
of
joint
(inaudible)
fraud,
we
submit
is
absurd
and
finally,
i
would
say
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
that
is
as
alleged,
but
it
also
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
specifically
told
these
people
to
address
all
mail
to
him
in
connection
with
the
escrow
to
his
attention
or
to
him
personally
because
as
the
record
indicates
he
told
them
he
did
not
want
anyone
at
first
securities
to
know
about
these
investments.
he
did
not
want
--
this
was
a
company
whose
name
he
never
revealed
and
it
should
remain
confidential.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
it
should
have
alerted
the
respondents,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
i
did
not.
the
net
capital
violation
was
a
temporary
violation
as
of
october
31,
1967.
it
was
$9,000.00
net
capital
violation
that
ernst
and
ernst
discovered
in
the
course
of
its
audit
and
which
it
reported
to
the
midwest
stock
exchange.
in
the
midwest
stock
exchange
at
the
time
of
reporting,
had
they
also
advised
the
midwest
stock
exchange
that
the
net
capital
violation
had
been
remedied
and
there
was
no
longer
a
violation
at
the
time
of
reporting
which
was
several
weeks
after
the
date
as
of
which
the
audit
was
being
made.
and
the
officer
of
the
midwest
stock
exchange,
mr.
rothling
advised
ernst
and
ernst
to
not
to
note
the
net
capital
violation
on
the
year
end
audit
because
it
had
been
corrected.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
no,
this
was
on
the
certified
financial
statements
that
were
to
be
submitted
to
the
midwest
stock
exchange.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
was
oral,
but
it
is
memorialized
in
a
memorandum.
it
is
in
the
record.
it
is
undisputed.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts
i
have
just
--
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
well
as
i
understand
it
yes,
the
argument
is
that
it
was
done
informally
rather
than
formal.
i
am
not
sure
what
formally
means.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
no,
the
fact
of
the
telephone
conversation
between
mr.
hooker
and
mr.
rothling
is
the
subject
of
a
memorandum.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
it
is
in
the
record.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
yes
sir
mr.
rothling
testified
as
of
the
conversation
in
related
litigation
right.
and
it
testified
that
he
instructed
ernst
and
ernst
not
to
include
the
existence
of
the
by
then
cured
violation.
mr.
robert
l.
berner,
jr.
the
total
amount
of
damages
is
a
$1.56
million
plus
attorney’s
fees
that
is
compared
to
the
annual
fee
received
by
ernst
and
ernst
of
between
$2,000.00
and
$25,000,000.00
for
making
--
performing
these
audits.
the
damages
had
been
reduced
by
approximately
$200,000.00
which
the
respondents
will
be
receiving
as
indicated
in
their
brief
out
of
the
receivership
proceeding.
thank
you.
