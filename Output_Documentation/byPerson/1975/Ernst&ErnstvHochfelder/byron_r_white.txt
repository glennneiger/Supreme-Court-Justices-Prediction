where
did
the
b-2
come
from,
b-2
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
b-2
does
not
refer
--
it
does
not
have
that
fraud
language?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
so
worded
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
part
of
your
submission
then
that
b-2
just
is
not
within
the
reach
of
--
if
it
is
construed
this
way,
not
to
require
scienter
of
any
kind
that
it
just
not
authorized
by
the
statute?
justice
white
incidentally
was
there
suggestion
involve
as
to
the
statute
limitations
questions?
justice
white
and
he
was
using
the
money
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
was
the
company
bankrupt?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
the
company
--
what
was
he
doing
to
the
company
that
led
its
failure?
this
escrow
arrangement,
how
did
that
contribute
to
the
failure
of
the
company?
justice
white
before
you
carry
on,
our
attempt
to
the
response
to
interrogatories
on
page
86
of
the
appendix
in
which
you
say,
we
do
not
contend
that
ernst
and
ernst
employed
any
scheme
or
auditors
to
defraud.
do
you
now
repudiate
that?
justice
white
on
the
negligence
basis,
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law
against
ernst
and
ernst?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
that
your
colleague
do
have
said
that
an
accounting
firm
is
not
to
certify
unless
another
person
in
the
organization
sees
the
mail?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
go
that
far
if
the
auditor
were
not
permitted
to
look
at
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lassers,
let
me
ask
you.
do
you
mean
that
if
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
10b,
that
we
could
affirm
the
judgment
on
17a?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
know
that,
is
there
a
private
cause
of
action
under
17a?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
so,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
we
could
not
affirm
on
17a?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
on
10
and
decide
against
you
on
the
10b,
you
have
lost
the
case,
have
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
17a
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
do
not
whether
you
could
stay
in
court
under
17?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did
not
decide
there
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
if
we
wanted
to
decide
an
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
is
17
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
cause
of
action
that
has
been
implied
and
the
problem
is
how
to
construe
the
law
and
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
performance
is
to
be
required,
now
why
should
we
not
look
to
some
other
provisions
in
the
act
to
see
what
--
for
some
guidance
and
if
you
did
what
would
be
the
nearest
guide
with
the
standard,
congress
has
provided
a
whole
range
of
standards
in
various
sections?
all
away
from
strict
liability
to
negligence
to
everything
to
deliberateness,
now
which
section
is
nearest
to
this
one?
is
there
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
i
disagree.
you
say
that
negligence
is
enough.
under
some
sections
of
securities
law,
negligence
is
not
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
i
still
wanted
to
--
at
the
outset
we
want
to
know
whether
the
proof
of
negligence
is
enough.
now,
congress
has
said
in
some
sections
that
where
it
has
provided
the
standard
itself,
it
has
said
that
negligence
is
not
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
some
questions
that
are
pretty
close
to
this
that
require
more
than
just
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
less
than
negligent?
