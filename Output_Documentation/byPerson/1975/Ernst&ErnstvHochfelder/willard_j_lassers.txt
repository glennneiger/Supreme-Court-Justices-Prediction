mr.
willard
j.
lassers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
off
by
responding
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
comment
or
question
as
whether
we
are
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
now
arguing
that
the
conduct
of
ernst
and
ernst
was
reckless.
our
answer
to
that
question
is
that
we
are
not
arguing
it
for
the
first
time
because
what
happened
was
we
tried
the
case
below
on
the
theory
that
all
we
have
to
show
was
a
failure
of
ernst
and
ernst
to
observe
proper
auditing
standards
and
that
case
was
tried
on
that
basis
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes
sir.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
it
was.
yes,
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
--
yes,
right.
and
then
in
this
court
in
the
certiorari
petition,
ernst
and
ernst
for
the
first
time
raised
the
issue
that
something
more
was
needed
and
we
said,
well,
now
that
something
more
is
needed,
we
are
prepared
to
prove
something
more.
second,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
comment
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
sir
because
what
we
are
saying
there
was
we
do
not
contend
that
ernst
and
ernst
was
in
league
with
nay.
what
we
do
say
is
that
if
this
court
holds
that
ernst
and
ernst,
if
that
recklessness
is
the
standard,
then
we
are
prepared
to
prove
recklessness
after
all
you
can
commit
a
fraud,
if
you
disregard,
you
close
your
eyes
to
the
obvious,
that
too
is
a
fraud
and
coming
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
comment
about
the
blue
chip
case.
as
i
read
blue
chip
i
do
not
think
that
is
applicable
because
as
i
read
blue
chip,
there
has
to
be
a
purchase
and
a
sale.
we
grounded
our
case
on
section
10b
and
there
was
clearly
a
purchase
and
a
sale.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
under
state
law?
i
do
not
know,
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
have
not
researched
illinois
on
that
question.
now,
i
would
like
to
comment
on
the
mail
rule.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes
sir.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
i
think
we
found
enough
to
prove
it.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
what?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
we
did
our
discovery
after
we
filed
our
complaint.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
but
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
we
could
have
asked,
but
if
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
sir,
because
ernst
and
ernst
never
raised
this
issue
that
we
have
to
prove
recklessness
until
we
got
here.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
that
certainly
is
true,
but
we
felt
that
we
had
alleged
enough.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
because
fraud
is
a
much
more
difficult
thing
to
prove,
but
and
i
like
to
say
this
about
the
mail
rule
because
i
do
not
think
the
full
flavor
of
the
mail
rule
has
come
through
to
the
court
and
that
is
this.
it
was
not
just
that
there
was
rule
on
the
abstract
that
the
auditor
failed
to
find.
what
happened
was
that
he
went
in,
the
auditors
went
in
every
year,
at
the
beginning
of
every
audit,
they
would
spend
two
and
three
days,
they
would
come
in
the
morning
at
nine
o’clock,
but
before
the
mail
was
untied
from
the
bundles
and
their
duty
was
to
examine
the
mail
as
it
came
in
and
they
watch
the
mail
being
untied
from
the
bundles
and
they
saw
the
clerk
then
abstract
the
letters
that
were
for
mr.
nay
and
put
them
off
to
one
side
and
the
auditors
never
raised
a
question
about
that
for
15
years
and
it
went
through
two
or
three
auditors.
now,
then
the
other
matter
that
mr.
berner
alluded
to
and
very
late
in
the
game.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
i
say
that
at
that
point,
and
mr.
meyer,
our
expert
cpa
says
that
that
would
have
been
enough
to
trigger
a
warning
to
him
that
further
investigation
was
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
right.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
right,
then
our
expert
said,
if
he
had
not
been
allowed
in
effect
to
look
at
that
mail
and
if
that
practice
had
not
been
stopped
as
an
extreme,
he
would
have
withdrawn
from
the
audit.
he
would
have
withdrawn
from
the
engagement.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
i
do
not
know
if
i
could
go
that
far?
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
i
think
that
our
auditor
says
that
he
would
have
not
certify
and
now
i
want
to
stress
to
the
court,
section
17a
of
the
1934
act
which
i
think
is
essential
to
this
action
here
because
that
is
the
section
which
says
the
brokers
have
to
keep
books
and
records
and
it
says
that
the
auditor
must
have
a
certified
audit
once
a
year
so
that
the
audits
that
ernst
and
ernst
was
performing
were
not
audits.
they
were
being
undertaken
voluntarily.
these
were
audits
pursuant
to
the
sec’s
command
and
the
audit
had
to
be
filed
and
certified
with
the
sec.
and
our
point
is
that
the
failure
to
observe
the
mail
practices
indicated
to
the
auditors,
they
should
have
indicated
that
there
was
violation
of
internal
accounting
control.
under
the
sec
regulations,
the
auditors
were
required
to
check
internal
accounting
controls,
and
therefore,
they
failed
in
their
statutory
and
regulatory
duties.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes
sir.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
sir,
but
as
i
understand
the
rule
that
we
relied
on
17a
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
17a
and
we
are
a
respondent,
and
therefore,
we
are
in
a
position
to
assert
anything
that
is
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
our
position
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
there
may
be.
now,
that
is
not
--
it
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
it
has
not
been
decided
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
our
position
on
17a
as
we
are
suing
under
section
10b
and
our
position
on
17a
--
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
our
position
on
17a
as
we
are
suing
under
10b,
and
our
position
is
that
section17a
sets
up
the
duty
and
it
also
sets
up
the
standard
that
has
to
be
adhered
to
under
10b.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
that
would
be
an
issue
before
this
court
whether
there
is
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
section
17
as
such.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
no,
they
reserved
the
question.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
and
as
i
read
the
seventh
circuit,
they
held
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
section
17
set-up
a
duty
and
the
standard.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
well,
i
think
17
is
here
in
the
sense
of
a
setting
up
the
standard
and
that
we
are
suing
under
10b
about
the
standard
of
care
that
the
auditor
is
responsible
for
is
laid
out
for
and
very
precisely
under
17.
now,
the
final
point
i
want
to
make
has
to
do
with
another
violation
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
net
capital
violation
that
occurred
very
late
in
the
game.
what
happened
there
was
this
and
here
i
think
that
ernst
and
ernst
did
in
effect
file
of
a
false
audit
certificate.
they
came
in
and
as
part
of
their
auditing
they
were
required
to
examine
the
question
whether
the
net
capital
rule
of
a
company
had
been
violated
and
they
found
that
there
was
a
violation.
they
called
it
to
the
attention
of
midwest,
midwest
said
do
not
say
anything
about
it.
they
did
not
say
anything
about
it
and
they
went
ahead
and
they
filed
--
gave
first
securities
a
clean
bill
of
health
with
the
sec.
mr.
willard
j.
lassers
yes,
he
is.
