chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
ernst
and
ernst
against
hochfelder.
mr.
berner
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
killed
his
wife
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
that
in
every
transaction
for
the
escrow
account,
the
checks
were
paid
to
nay
personally
and
not
to
first
trust?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
statute
deals
in
terms
of
affirmative
action
rather
than
commissions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
claim
here
in
the
pleadings
of
reliance
on
the
ernst
and
ernst
certificate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
derive
from
the
mail,
the
opening
of
his
mail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
fact
that
he
did
not
take
the
vacations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
suggest
something
like
the
common
law
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
theory,
did
they
proceed,
on
10b?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now,
if
the
sec
suggestion
is
construed
to
be
a
suggestion
for
a
common
law
claim
then
it
is
a
different
theory,
is
it
not?
i
put
that
if.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
berner.
mr.
king?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
it
would
have
necessarily
uncovered
the
mail
rule
that
you
just
described?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
whom
do
you
suggest
there
was
collusion
here?
you
say
it
takes
two,
at
least
two
to
accomplish
collusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
all
the
factual
situation
was
the
same
and
mr.
nay
had
a
sideline
dealing
in
second
mortgages
and
did
that
through
the
private
mail
rule
and
that
the
whole
scheme
involved
forgeries
of
the
second
mortgages,
would
you
think
that
the
same
kind
of
liability
would
follow
in
that
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
mean
a
series.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
are
cutting
onto
your
colleagueâ€™s
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lassers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gonson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
berner,
you
have
something
any
further?
you
have
about
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
to
say
that
aid
or
abet
without
any
knowledge
would
be
quite
different
from
the
use
of
those
terms
as
words
of
originally
field
of
criminal
law,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
burger
so,
that
is
in
your
point
of
view
that
it
alert
them
as
much
--
should
have
alerted
them
as
much
as
the
hypothetical
which
mr.
justice
stewart
gave
you
about
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
you
say
it
was
confirmed
in
writing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-1042,
ernst
&
ernst
against
hochfelder
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
