justice
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
berner,
i
think
the
commission
suggests
that
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
amend
their
complaint
to
affect
the
theory
of
reckless
and
the
intentional
rather
than
negligent
conduct?
justice
jr.
what
do
you
think?
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
jr.
on
the
principles
you
suggest
rather
most
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
what
has
the
ernst
and
ernst
do
you
contemplate
is
left
to
the
case
when
it
gets
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
jr.
but
it
would
have
to
be
an
argument
on
something
more
than
negligence?
justice
jr.
in
admittance
which
alleges
at
least
recklessness?
justice
jr.
or
an
amendment
though
it
did
not
have
to
be?
justice
jr.
i
think
it
is
standard?
