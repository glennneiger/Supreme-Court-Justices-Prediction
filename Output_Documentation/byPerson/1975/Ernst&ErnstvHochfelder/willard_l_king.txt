mr.
willard
l.
king
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1968,
a
man
calling
himself
leston
b.
nay,
a
member
of
the
midwest
stock
exchange
and
president
of
first
securities
company
of
chicago
murdered
his
wife
and
killed
himself.
he
left
a
suicide
note
in
which
he
said
that
his
company
was
bankrupt
because
of
his
debts
committed
over
a
period
of
30
years.
his
suicide
note
also
said
that
a
certain
escrow
in
which
he
had
sold
investments
to
the
customers
of
first
securities
company
was
spurious.
nay
had
persuaded
these
plaintiffs,
long
time
customers
of
first
securities
company
to
let
that
company
sell
their
standard
securities
and
invest
the
proceeds
in
this
fictitious
escrow.
there
was
no
escrow.
nay
converted
their
money
to
his
own
use
immediately
upon
its
receipt.
nay’s
suicide
note
also
asked
that
ernst
and
ernst
be
notified.
why?
what
part
did
ernst
take
it
in
nay’s
horrid
story?
for
20
years,
ernst
had
certified
each
year
to
midwest
stock
exchange
that
first
securities
company,
a
balance
sheet
of
first
securities
company
showing
it
to
be
solvent
when
in
fact
it
was
utterly
insolvent.
in
each
of
those
30
years,
ernst
had
certified
to
midwest
stock
exchange
that
it
had
revealed
the
internal
accounting
control
of
nay’s
company
as
it
was
required
to
do
by
the
standards
of
its
profession.
actually,
the
company
had
no
internal
accounting
control
because
they
had
nay
had
adamant
office
rule
that
all
mail
received
by
the
company,
addressed
to
him
or
to
the
company
for
his
attention
could
only
be
opened,
seen
or
read
by
him.
when
he
was
away
for
a
few
days,
the
mail
by
his
command
piled
up
unopened
on
his
desk.
nay
secreted
the
incoming
mail
on
his
debts.
a
great
mass
of
his
correspondents
with
his
escrow
victims
was
found
locked
in
his
desk.
ernst
never
reviewed
the
internal
accounting
control.
if
they
had
done
so
it
would
have
uncovered
nay’s
fraud.
now
what
is
internal
accounting
control?
mr.
willard
l.
king
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
is
internal
accounting
control?
in
1939,
the
sec
published
a
volume
on
that
subject
which
established
the
very
simple
definition
of
that
term.
internal
accounting
control
means
that
the
work
of
each
officer
and
employee
must
be
counter
checked
by
the
work
of
another.
it
means
that
no
fraud
or
crime
can
exist
without
collusion
between
two
or
more
persons.
it
means
that
no
one
person
can
profit
by
fraud
because
his
fraud
will
be
discovered
by
another
person.
mr.
willard
l.
king
there
was
no
collusion
here
that
i
suggest.
i
was
giving
the
definition
of
internal
accounting
control
as
stated
by
the
sec
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
12
leading
american
public
accountants
in
1939.
i
did
not
suggest
collusion.
the
essence
of
the
internal
accounting
control
is
required
duality.
in
1939,
the
sec
published
the
complete
transcripts
of
the
testimony
of
12
leading
american
publican
accountants,
each
of
whom
testified
to
this
definition
of
required
duality
as
internal
accounting
control.
one
of
those
experts
was
the
senior
partner
of
ernst
and
ernst.
this
occurred
in
the
sec’s
investigation
of
the
colossal
frauds
that
mckesson
and
robbins,
a
multi
million
dollar
drug
concern;
no
securities
were
listed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
the
president
of
that
company
was
an
ex-convict
under
a
fictitious
name
who
operated
the
company
with
the
aid
of
his
three
brothers
also
under
various
fictitious
names.
they
inflated
the
sales
and
inventories
by
many
millions.
like
nay,
the
president
shot
himself
when
his
fraud
was
discovered.
mckesson
had
been
audited
by
a
nationally
known
public
accounting
firm
and
the
sec
condemned
its
failure
to
check
the
internal
accounting
control.
one
of
the
mckesson
criminals
required
that
all
of
the
incoming
mail
be
put
unopened
on
his
desk.
he
never
took
a
vacation.
under
these
circumstances,
the
sec
questioned
each
of
the
twelve
leading
american
public
accountants
on
the
duty
of
a
public
accountant
with
respect
to
checking
the
incoming
mail.
it
showed
each
of
them
a
bulletin
of
the
american
institute
of
certified
public
accountants
under
a
caption
“safeguards
surrounding
the
handling
of
incoming
mail.”
each
of
the
twelve
leading
public
accountants
testified
that
a
public
accountant
must
not
fail
to
check
the
routine
of
examining,
handling
the
incoming
mail
and
find
it
to
be
controlled
so
that
no
one
could
secrete
that
mail.
mr.
willard
l.
king
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
the
grossest
sort
of
negligence
and
gross
negligence
of
the
public
accountant
as
evidence
of
fraud.
mr.
willard
l.
king
i
did
not
mean
to
garble
them,
mr.
justice.
mr.
willard
l.
king
our
complaint
does
not
allege
either
negligence
or
fraud.
mr.
willard
l.
king
yes.
mr.
willard
l.
king
of
course
i
stand
upon
it
mr.
justice.
mr.
willard
l.
king
well,
i
asked,
if
necessary
leave
to
amend
the
complaint
to
charge
gross
negligence
equivalent
to
fraud.
mr.
willard
l.
king
yes.
well,
this
court
has
previously
in
cases
involving
summary
judgment
permitted
case
to
be
reversed
for
amendment
of
the
complaint.
mr.
willard
l.
king
that
is
correct.
mr.
willard
l.
king
in
1971.
mr.
willard
l.
king
well,
it
only
occurred
to
me
when
this
court
allowed
certiorari
on
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit.
i
had
been
describing
the
mckesson
report
of
the
sec.
since
that
report,
since
1939,
the
sec
in
two
cases
has
suspended
a
broker
from
the
exchanges
for
tolerating
nay’s
mail
rule.
the
advisory
committee
of
broker
dealers
to
the
sec
in
its
volume
entitled
“guide
to
broker
dealer
compliance”
has
stated
no
personal
mail
should
be
permitted
in
an
office
or
any
mail
distributed
unopened
to
any
salesman
or
other
employees
and
our
position
to
ernst's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
plaintiffs
filed
the
affidavit
of
fred
j.
duncan,
a
former
president
of
the
illinois
society
of
certified
public
accountants
and
a
former
member
of
the
board
for
certifying
them.
mr.
duncan’s
affidavit
stated
that
he
would
not
have
certified
the
balance
sheet
of
a
company
employing
nay’s
mail
rule
because
such
a
company
had
no
internal
accounting
control.
to
the
same
effect,
the
plaintiff’s
filed
in
opposition
to
the
summary
judgment
the
affidavit
of
gerhard
meyer,
a
distinguished
public
accountant
of
30
years
experience.
ernst
filed
in
support
of
its
motion
for
summer
judgment,
the
affidavit
of
its
partner
jerry
hooker
who
had
been
in-charge
of
the
first
securities
company
audit.
hooker’s
affidavit
stated
that
nay’s
mail
rule
was
not
relevant
to
internal
accounting
control.
on
his
deposition,
hooker
testified
that
he
would
had
not
have
objected
to
nay’s
mail
rule
if
he
had
known
about
it.
he
was
clearly
unacquainted
with
the
elementary
rules
of
his
profession.
his
affidavit
is
contrary
to
the
affidavits
of
the
two
distinguished
public
accountants
that
the
plaintiffs
filed.
it
is
contrary
to
the
testimony
of
the
twelve
leading
american
public
accountants
published
by
the
sec
in
1939.
it
is
in
the
teeth
of
the
two
cases
where
the
sec
has
suspended
a
broker
from
the
exchanges
for
tolerating
nay’s
mail
rule.
i
submit
that
no
summary
judgment
may
be
issued
on
that
affidavit.
i
turn
now
to
privity
or
as
judge
cardozo
called
it
near
privity
between
the
plaintiffs
and
ernst.
these
plaintiffs
had
been
long
time
customers
of
first
securities
company.
nay
made
the
proposal
of
the
escrow
to
them
in
the
office
of
the
company.
nay
made
the
proposal
of
the
escrow
to
them
under
this
plaque.
this
plaque
was
nay’s
principal
tool
for
perpetrating
his
fraud.
by
this
plaque,
nay
defrauded
these
people
of
their
life
savings,
aggregating
approximately
$1
million.
it
reads,
“midwest
stock
exchange
organized
1882,
where
highest
standards
have
commercial
honor
and
integrity
are
maintained
and
just
an
equitable
principles
of
trade
and
business
prevail.”
this
certificate
of
membership
is
issued
to
leston
b.
nay
of
first
securities
company
of
chicago.
that
plaque
was
kept
there
for
20
years
by
ernst’s
false
certification
of
the
balance
sheet
of
first
securities
company.
that
plaque
would
have
come
down
if
ernst
had
ever
delivered
a
correct
balance
sheet.
that
plaque
would
have
come
down
if
ernst
had
ever
told
midwest
stock
exchange
that
first
securities
company
had
no
internal
accounting
control.
that
plaque
would
have
come
down
if
ernst
had
ever
told
midwest
that
nay
secreted
the
incoming
mail.
twice
the
sec
has
suspended
brokers
from
the
exchanges
for
tolerating
that
rule.
mr.
willard
l.
king
i
think
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
blue
chip
case
that
might
have
a
bearing
on
17a-5,
but
our
complaint
did
not
mention
17a-5
and
i
would
avoid
it.
nay
represented
this
escrow
to
these
plaintiffs
as
the
first
securities
company
project.
the
evidence
of
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
first
nay
decision
in
the
463rd
federal
second
is
overwhelming.
when
one
of
the
plaintiffs
asked
to
withdraw
his
escrow
investment,
nay
said
to
him,
your
money
is
safe
at
first
securities.
and
ernst
certificate
was
given
wholly
for
the
benefit
of
these
customers
of
the
company
and
not
at
all
for
the
benefit
of
midwest
stock
exchange.
it
is
only
in
the
name
was
the
protection
of
the
customer’s
of
the
company.
i
suggest
that
we
thus
have
a
situation
approaching
privity
as
judge
cardozo
said
between
ernst
and
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
willard
l.
king
we
never
saw
the
financial
statement.
what
we
did
see
this
plaque
which
was
kept
there
by
that
certificate.
mr.
willard
l.
king
we
never
saw
it.
mr.
willard
l.
king
i
agree
that
we
never
saw
the
financial
statement,
but
i
think
our
loss
was
a
direct
result
of
ernst’s
failure
to
properly
audit
the
company.
there
failure
to
discover
nay’s
mail
rule
which
would
have
terminated
nay’s
operations.
he
could
not
continue
those
operations
if
an
auditor
reported
that
he
has
secreted
the
incoming
mail.
mr.
willard
l.
king
i
would
think
you
could
assume
an
isolated
transaction
by
nay
--
mr.
willard
l.
king
a
series
of
isolated
transactions?
but
that
is
not
this
situation.
here,
he
represented
that
this
escrow
was
a
first
securities
project.
mr.
willard
l.
king
that
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
willard
l.
king
oh!
that
was
an
originally
back
in
1938,
a
tremendous
theft
of
some
$474,000.00.
mr.
willard
l.
king
his
failure
was
a
suicide
when
he
no
longer
could
put
all
the
bank
out
in
colorado
to
whom
he
was
short
some
$475
--
the
company
was
short
some
$474,000.00
and
mind
you
this
is
incorporated
for
35,000.
the
company
was
utterly,
hopelessly
insolvent
from
the
instant
ernst
started
to
audit.
mr.
willard
l.
king
thank
you.
