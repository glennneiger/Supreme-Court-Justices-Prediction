what
is
you
say
is,
just
before
you
proceed
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
it
has
been
your
submission
up
to
now
that
these
two
statues
can
co-exist
without
--
can
compatibly
and
continually
co-exist.
have
i
understood
you
correctly,
have
i?
justice
potter
stewart
if
one
only
looked
only
at
the
text
of
the
venue
provision
of
the
national
bank
act,
the
1864
act,
your
argument
will
have
a
very
great
deal
of
(inaudible)
i
think,
because
it
simple
provides
that
actions
and
proceedings
against
any
banking
association
maybe
be
brought,
but
we
have
langdeau
case
and
the
michigan
case,
which
construed
that
language
in
that
statute
to
say
that
this
is
exclusive,
it
is
not
permissive,
that
it
is
exclusive
and
i
do
not
really
follow
you
when
you
said
that
these
two
venue
statutes
can
co-exist.
i
do
not
mean
that
you
will
loose
your
case
if
they
cannot,
but
the
security
exchange
commission,
for
example
tells
us
that
these
two
venue
statutes
are
in
hopeless
and
irreconcilable
conflict?
justice
potter
stewart
you
obviously
disagree,
because
you
say
they
can
both
co-exist?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
they
did
construe
the
venue
provision
of
the
national
bank
act.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
question
to
the
fact
that
congress
could
have
amended
the
national
bank
act
venue
provision.
it
could
have
repealed
it.
it
could
have
done
a
variety
of
things
to
it,
but
everybody
agrees,
i
gather
that
there
is
nothing
--
congress
has
certainly
done
nothing
explicit
with
respect
to
the
1864
act?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
go
on.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
case
requires
us
to
determine
which
venue
provision
controls
in
the
event
a
national
banking
association
is
sued
in
a
federal
court
for
allegedly
violating
the
securities
exchange
act.
the
broad
venue
provision
of
the
securities
exchange
act
which
allows
suits
under
that
act
to
be
brought
at
any
district,
where
the
defendant
may
be
found
or
the
now
venue
provision
of
the
national
bank
act
which
allows
national
banking
associations
to
be
sued
only
in
the
district,
where
they
are
established.
the
petitioner
mr.
hyman
radzanower,
instituted
a
class
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
in
new
york,
alleging
among
other
things
that
the
respondent,
the
first
national
bank
of
boston,
which
is
a
national
banking
association
with
its
principle
office
in
boston,
massachusetts
had
violated
the
federal
securities
laws
by
failing
to
disclose
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
to
the
investing
public
its
knowledge
of
certain
adverse
financial
information
about
one
of
its
customers,
the
teleprompter
corporation
and
of
securities
laws
violations
by
that
company.
the
complaint
alleged
that
venue
was
proper
under
section
27
of
the
securities
exchange
act,
but
the
bank
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
to
it
--
asserting
that
venue
as
to
it,
lay
only
under
section
94
of
the
national
bank
act.
following
the
settled
law
of
the
second
circuit,
the
district
court
granted
the
bank's
motion
to
dismiss.
it
held
that
absent
a
waiver
or
consent,
a
national
bank
may
be
sued
only
in
the
district
in
which
it
is
established.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
judgment
without
opinion
and
because
of
differing
views
in
the
circuits
as
to
the
statutory
venue
question
presented,
we
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
believe
that
the
narrowly
drawn
specific
venue
provision
of
the
national
bank
act
must
prevail
over
the
broader,
more
generally
applicable
venue
provision
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
we
conclude,
therefore,
that
a
national
banking
association
is
subject
to
suit
under
the
securities
exchange
act
only
in
that
district
wherein
it
is
established
and
that
the
judgment
before
us
must
accordingly
be
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
