mr.
ira
jay
sands
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justices
of
the
court,
we
have
a
very
simple
factual
situation
here,
in
which
a
national
bank
is
one
of
a
number
of
defendants
under
a
1934
act,
securities
action
a
10
(b)
(5)
claim.
and,
we
go
back
to
a
widely
known
dispute
in
this
nation,
in
which
we
find
the
third
circuit
now,
recently
aligned
against
all
of
the
other
circuits,
as
to
whether
in
a
securities
related
10
(b)
(5)
action,
the
plaintiff
must
divide
his
case
and
must
sue
the
national
bank
in
the
particular
district
in
which
that
national
bank
was
established
or
whether
under
the
wide
venue
provisions
of
the
34
act,
a
plaintiff
may
join
the
national
bank,
together
with
the
other
defendants
in
the
district
in
which
the
violations
took
place
or
as
the
34
act
permits,
where
the
defendants
maybe
located
or
found.
it
is
our
position,
that
in
the
second
circuit,
where
this
action
commenced,
under
the
bruns,
nordeman
case,
this
situation
is
jelled
and
a
divided
or
bifurcated
litigation
will
be
required.
it
is
our
position
sir,
however,
that
that
is
erroneous
and
that
the
1864
national
bank
act
was
not
necessarily
repealed
by
implication
or
otherwise
by
the
1934
act,
but
that
the
venue
provision
of
the
1864
act
was
broadened,
was
extended
in
the
one
instance
in
connection
with
a
1934
securities
act
violation.
now,
to
lightly
touch
upon
ancient
history
in
these
hollowed
--
mr.
ira
jay
sands
your
honor,
we
of
course,
are
concerned
with
a
34
act
and
a
33
act,
which
were
overlaid
as
well.
however,
your
honor
is
correct,
when
any
act
states
that
the
defendants
maybe
sued
in
a
venue
where
they
maybe
found
or
where
transaction
took
place.
i
would
agree
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
argument
i
am
professing
for
the
34
act
would
apply
if
the
language
were
similar.
now,
going
back
to
ancient
history
of
these
hallowed
halls,
we
know
that
a
national
bank
is
an
arm
of
the
american
government.
the
cases
are
--
the
law
had
not
been
cited
for
the
lack
of
pilling
on
additional
material.
the
first
national
bank
was
organized
in
the
late
1700s
as
an
arm
of
the
government
and
it
could
not
be
sued
as
the
government
cannot
be
sued
without
its
consent.
now,
until
the
1863,
as
modified
by
the
1864
act,
one
could
not
sue
a
national
bank,
which
was
set-up
to
administer
currency,
which
was
set-up
to
administer
the
fiscal
policies
of
the
united
states,
except
as
specifically
permitted
by
the
congress,
by
the
sovereign.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that
there
were
national
chattered
banks
prior
to
1863,
but
the
1863
legislation,
which
then
found
itself
amended
in
1864
was
an
all
encompassing
scheme
for
the
institution
and
the
using
the
broad
scale
operation
of
national
banks,
but
the
first
bank
we
find
out
in
the
brief
of
the
sec
as
amicus
in
their
footnote
--
mr.
ira
jay
sands
my
recollection
is
not
precise
as
to
the
thing
in
the
sec's
amicus
brief,
but
it
is
in
the
footnote
that
the
first
bank
was
called
bank
of
the
united
states
and
then
we
had
a
lapse
of
its
charter
some
ten
years
or
so
later
and
then
later
another
bank
was
set-up
to
administer
the
fiscal
policy
of
the
united
states
called
the
first
bank
of
the
united
states
or
first
national
bank
of
united
states.
and,
the
1863,
1864
legislation
was
all
encompassing,
a
schematic
to
operate
national
banks.
now,
we
take
the
position
that
this
was
permission
by
the
sovereign
to
be
sued
to
have
one
of
its
instrumentalities
sue
and
the
sovereign
determined
where
it
can
be
sued.
it
can
be
sued
in
the
district
in
which
it
was
constituted.
now,
we
take
no
issue
at
that
until
1933-34.
in
1933
and
1934
of
course,
we
find
as
it
is
commonly
called
the
roosevelt
legislation
concerning
the
33
act,
and
the
34
act,
the
so-called
remedial
statutes
concerning
banks
and
the
like
and
we
find
that
we
have
a
number
of
cases
of
bell
against
hood,
sec
against
joyner
(ph),
the
remedial
statutes.
we
go
all
the
way
down
to
affiliated
youth
case,
which
was
decided
only
recently,
sec
against
capital
gains
bureau,
the
idea
that
the
remedial
statutes
be
broadly
and
non-restrictively
interpreted.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
say
yes,
emphatically
yes.
the
national
banks
in
33
and
34
were
under
consideration.
there
is
a
senate
report,
which
is
referred
to
in
our
briefs.
the
sec
has
referred
to
that.
the
control
has
referred
to
it,
as
well,
as
we
did.
the
problems
of
national
banks
were
divided
in
our
analysis
in
two
parts.
one;
the
necessity
to
protect
the
investors
and
the
deposits.
we
all
remember
the
run
on
the
bank
of
united
states.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
yes
sir.
there
is
nothing
precise
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
we
have
been
able
to
locate,
which
indicated
that
the
congress
considered
the
venue
provision
of
national
banks
at
that
time.
we
can
only
reason
from
our
incisiveness,
which
we
hope
is
accurate.
in
that
there
is
decisional
law,
which
indicates
that
congress
knows
every
statute
on
the
subject
when
it
legislates.
congress
did
set-up
the
glass-steagall
act
to
concern
itself
basically
with
protection
of
depositors,
protection
of
the
bank
itself
in
that
regard.
congress
set-up
the
33
and
34
act
in
which
it
did
not
set
forth
any
exceptions,
whatever,
to
the
venue
provision
with
regard
to
any
actions
concerning
the
33
and
34
act.
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
the
precise
question
was
ever
discussed.
it
is
merely
by
inference.
now,
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
reason
for
implied
repeal,
although
the
facts
as
they
approach
would
give
us
the
effect
of
the
implied
repeal,
if
we
would
like
to,
but
judicially
we
are
constrained
to
say
that
both
may
exist
together
if
that
is
possible.
now,
our
interpretation
of
these
acts
would
leave
both
fully
intact
in
securities
matters,
the
plaintiff
and
the
commission
would
have
its
choice
of
venue,
in
non-securities
matters
or
except
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
aptly
pointed
out
in
other
matters
where
there
maybe
specific
statutory
language,
one
would
have
to
follow
the
bank
act
of
64.
now,
congress
did
exempt
in
the
33
and
34
act
when
it
is
so
desired.
there
were
certain
definite
exemptions
in
levin
against
great
western
sugar
company,
which
was
a
district
court
of
new
jersey
case
which
started
the
third
circuit
run
of
matters
that
indicated
that
there
was
a
wider
venue
than
did
the
second
circuit.
the
judge
said,
“a
quick
examination
of
the
33
and
34
acts
reveal
that
on
a
number
of
the
cases
the
legislative
draftsman
found
fit
to
exempt
national
banks
and
their
securities
from
provisions
of
the
act.”
and
then,
he
cites
15
u.s.c.
77
(c),
15
u.s.c.
77
(l),”
etcetera.
it
becomes
clear
that
the
legislative
draftsman
knew
about
national
banks,
when
writing
the
securities
acts
and
knew
how
to
exempt
them
from
provisions
of
the
acts,
when
they
chose
to
do
so.
it
would
be
a
new
usurpation
of
legislative
prerogatives
for
this
court
to
impute
an
exception
to
the
34
act
in
view
of
the
background
just
described.
now,
the
chicago
bank
as
amicus
in
its
brief
admits
that
there
are
exceptions
for
united
states
banks,
for
national
banks
and
for
the
united
states
government
from
the
registration
requirements
of
the
3
(a)
(2)
of
the
33
act.
the
controller
admits
that
as
well
on
page
6
and
again
on
page
16.
in
this
court,
in
carnation
against
pacific
conference
in
1965,
quoted
united
states
against
borden,
which
is
308
us
to
this
effect,
“if
congress
had
desire
to
grant
any
further
immunity,
congress
doubtless
would
have
said
so.”
the
courts
have
in
addition
carved
out
additional
immunities
from
the
1864
venue.
for
instance,
this
court
in
1968,
in
great
american
insurance
against
united
states
carved
down
an
exception
for
a
claim
being
filed
by
a
national
bank
in
the
court
of
claims
and
said
that
the
national
bank
must
go
to
another
district
where
the
court
of
claims
were
sitting
in
a
particular
matter,
in
order
to
file
its
claim
and
the
national
bank
there
said,
“but
you
are
taking
us
out
of
the
district
that
the
1964
act
required.”
this
court
said,
“no,
if
you
are
filing
the
claim
under
the
court
of
claims
act
you
must
go
to
that
district,
where
that
matter
is
now
pending.”
in
transfers
under
the
jpml,
which
happen
all
the
time,
the
jpml
has
consistently
said
to
national
banks,
“you
must
follow
along
the
case.
you
are
not
protected
in
any
manner
by
the
1864
venue
to
have
a
separate
bifurcated
pre-trial
in
your
own
district.
you
must
follow
the
case
and
of
course,
you
come
back
later
on
after
the
pre-trial
is
concluded”
and
we
have
that
in
such
cases
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie
railroad,
great
western
ranches,
len
turner
(ph).
we
have
that
in
westec.
now,
we
have
another
rule,
which
has
been
followed
by
the
district
courts,
i
have
not
found
authority
that
it
has
come
up
here
and
that
is
concerning
the
impleaded
third
party,
where
a
national
bank
is
impleaded
as
a
third
party
and
then
says,
“wait,
i
can
only
be
sued
in
my
own
district.”
the
district
courts,
the
circuit
courts,
we
have
a
fifth
circuit,
lone
star
package
against
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
said
and
there
were
others,
said,
“no,
if
you
are
a
third
party
impleaded
defendant,
you
must
go
to
the
district,
where
the
action
is
being
litigated.”
basically,
the
reasoning
behind
that
i
believe
has
been
judicial
economy.
we
can
just
visualize
the
number
of
different
bifurcated
trials
that
would
result
if
the
banks
had
that
cloak
of
immunity.
now,
i
do
not,
in
fact
i
insist
that
the
congress
did
not
in
1864
give
the
banks
a
cloak
of
immunity,
but
the
congress
as
the
sovereign
in
1863
and
1864
opened
the
field,
opened
the
wall
of
sovereign
immunity
and
gave
us
permission
to
sue
national
banks
at
that
time.
and
then,
in
1934
the
congress
again
opened
the
wall
of
immunity,
because
of
the
overriding
concern
for
the
populous
involved
in
the
securities
frauds.
so,
it
is
not
a
question
by
which
our
national
banks
have
for
30
years
impressed
the
lower
courts
that
they
are
protected,
that
there
is
immunity,
that
the
statute
was
made
for
their
protection.
i
say
no.
i
say
the
1864
statute
was
made
to
permit
the
banks
to
be
sued,
not
to
protect
the
banks
from
all
suits.
the
1934
statute
was
enacted
to
permit
banks
to
be
sued
a
little
more
widely
in
a
more
practical
sense.
now,
there
is
no
reason
why
both
of
these
interesting
statutes
may
not
live
together,
may
not
be
supplementary,
may
not
each
be
fully
effective,
they
certainly
can
co-exist.
we
found
that
in
the
robertson
case
422
u.s.,
where
we
had
two
acts,
which
permitted
to
co-exist.
this
court
has
frequently
admonished
the
lower
courts
to
attempt
to
prevent
conflict
in
statutes,
achieve
the
aim
of
the
1934
act
of
merrill
lynch
against
ware,
not
many
years
ago.
we
have
been
admonished
to
interpret
statutes
by
practical
experience
and
practical
experience
certainly
would
permit
the
banks
to
be
sued
in
a
securities-related
matter,
in
the
same
district
where
everyone
else
is
aaron
boyle
against
united
states
in
‘72.
now,
even
going
back
to
these
interesting
old
cases,
such
as
red
rock
against
henry,
unless
the
acts
are
completely
repugnant
keep
them
both
alive
and
we
have
a
long
line
of
decisions.
in
wilmot
against
mudge,
which
is
103
u.s.
back
in
1880,
this
court
said
that
both
statutes
can
be
said
to
have
their
own
spheres
of
operation,
if
both
can
stand
by
any
reasonable
construction,
that
construction
must
be
adapted,
the
basic
tenant
of
law
in
this
nation.
we
have
an
interesting
case
1846
beals
against
hale
and
there
this
court
discussed
a
parliamentary
example,
where
parliament
said
that
a
particular
crime
was
punishable
at
assizes
court
and
then,
parliament
subsequently
allowed
another
court
to
have
jurisdiction.
this
court
stated
that
examples
like
that,
you
must
reconcile
them,
they
both
must
exist
and
the
government
in
a
particular
situation
like
that
would
have
a
choice
of
either
forum.
now,
in
the
posadas
case,
posadas
against
national
city
bank,
which
my
learned
brother
has
attempted
to
interpret
against
us,
this
court
said
in
1936
that
we
must
seek
to
interpret
the
new
statute
as
a
continuation
of
the
old
statute
whenever
possible.
there
certainly
has
been
no
statement
in
any
statute
or
in
any
interpretation
by
this
court
that
a
previous
act
may
not
be
enlarged,
that
a
venue
may
not
be
enlarged.
the
united
states
both
carries
against
u.s.,
400
u.s.
351
in
1971,
which
concerned
seamen
wages
and
the
old
law
was
that
the
shipping
commissioners
would
determine
any
problem
of
seaman's
wages.
then,
came
a
modern
law,
which
set-up
the
labor
management
relations
act,
a
very
modern
procedure,
but
it
did
not
repeal
the
old.
this
court
held
that
the
old
act
was
a
very
literal
one;
the
new
act
was
a
progressive
one.
however,
that
did
not
permit
this
court
and
did
not
permit
a
court
to
abrogate
or
repeal
the
old
act
and
that
they
both
would
exist
as
two
separate
possible
methods
of
procedure
by
the
seaman,
who
was
injured
in
his
financial
rights.
now,
we
do
have
our
decisions
of
this
court,
which
insist
that
the
power
to
enforce,
implies
the
power
to
make
effective
the
right
of
recovery
afforded
by
the
34
act
or
by
remedial
statutes,
a
case
against
borac
(ph),
which
cites
with
approval,
bell
against
hood,
1946,
may
i
quote
this
shortly.
“it
is
well
settled
that
where
legal
rights
have
been
invaded
and
a
federal
statute
provides
for
a
general
right
to
sue
for
such
invasion,
federal
courts
may
use
any
available
remedy
to
make
good
the
wrong
done.”
mr.
ira
jay
sands
that
is
my
strongest
argument.
i
feel
strongly
about
that.
i
have
also
placed
my
leg
on
the
other
point
that
even
if
they
cannot
co-exist.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
i
cannot
--
mr.
ira
jay
sands
i
do
not
fully
agree
with
my
very
learned
brother
at
the
sec
and
i
have
told
him
that.
i
think
he
has
taken
a
strong
viewpoint,
they
cannot
co-exist.
it
is
my
position
sir
that
the
cases,
which
you
mentioned
refer
not
to
two
special
federal
venue
statutes.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
yes
sir,
but
they
construed
vis-à-vis
a
state
act.
they
did
not
construe
vis-à-vis
an
equally
significant
federal
statute.
the
1864
statute
did
not
say
that
no
future
act
may
further
enlarge
venue
and
the
1934
act
did
further
enlarge
venue.
the
case
which
your
honor
has
cited,
construed
the
question
of
permissiveness
with
regard
to
state
venue
and
there,
there
is
no
question
in
mind.
i
do
not
know
of
a
single
decision
reasonably
interpreted,
which
would
permit
any
state
statute
to
enlarge
the
1864
venue
provisions,
but
congress
is
congress.
congress
is
in
effect
a
continuing
body
from
the
day
of
the
founding
fathers
to
this
day.
congress
may
change
its
mind.
congress
may
enlarge
what
has
previously
had
restricted.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
explicit
it
did
not,
implicit
we
believe
they
did.
implicit
--
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
mean
to
interrupt
you
sir.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
implicit
we
believe
they
did
for
the
precise
reason
that
the
34
act
was
an
all
encompassing
method
of
operations
with
regard
to
security,
something
quite
new
in
this
nation.
the
exception
was
not
put
in
there.
i
have
mentioned
that
the
34
act
did
accept,
precisely
accept
certain
activities
vis-à-vis
securities
of
national
banks,
specifically
except
national
banks,
united
state
government
securities
and
similar
and
i
read
judge
bloomfeld’s
opinion,
language
in
the
district
of
connecticut
in
which
he
said
they
knew
how,
a
little
sarcastic
as
i
read
it,
and
interesting
in
his
emphasis,
they
knew
how
to
except
if
they
wish
to
except.
there
was
no
exception.
there
could
be
now
exception
to
a
state
statue
which
attempted
to
broaden
the
1864
law
or
accept
from
the
1864
law.
i
therefore,
i
differed
with
my
brother
at
the
sec
in
their
amicus
brief,
when
i
said
that
the
34
statute
is
a
supplementary
to
the
64
statute.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
i
have
not
sir.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
no
sir,
i
have
not.
i
feel
that
waiver
is
a
hard
road
to
hold
--
mr.
ira
jay
sands
no
sir,
we
did
not
cite
that
case.
there
have
been
situations
where
waiver
has
taken
place.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
we
did
sir.
i
believe
we
raised
it
in
the
petition
for
cert
and
we
have
raised
in
each
one
of
our
briefs.
we
have
not,
however,
hammered
hard
upon
it.
i
feel
that
waiver
is
our
weakest
argument
in
this
regard.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
yes
sir.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
no
sir.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
no,
the
two
questions,
which
i
did
present
in
our
brief,
i
include
the
second
as
a
waiver
and
i
have
said
sir
without
a
question
that
the
waiver
is
the
weakest
of
the
two
arguments.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
i
am
perfectly
content
your
honor
to
hold
firm
on
the
question
of
both
statutes
living
together
or
in
the
alternative.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
no,
i
do
not
sir.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
in
the
body
sir.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
your
honor,
mr.
gatley
(ph)
who
argued
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
circuit
court
was
met
with
the
dilemma.
there
is
no
question
as
you
said
to
judge
mulligan,
there
is
no
question
about
that
the
law
of
the
second
circuit
is
very
clear,
the
bruns,
nordeman
case
and
when
mr.
gatley
presented
orally
the
third
circuit
decision
and
the
judge
mulligan
said,
“do
you
wish
us
to
reverse
ourselves?”
mr.
gatley’s
language
in
effect
was
a
polite
suggestion
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
retired
chief
judge
had
previously
reluctantly
affirmed
in
the
bruns’
case
that
he
politely
was
suggesting
that
perhaps
you
might
reconsider
it.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
now
have
a
peg
to
hang
your
hat
on,
the
waiver
question.
the
reluctance
was
something
that
we
were
hoping
would
cause
the
panel
to
change.
the
panel
is
very
quick
to
affirm.
mr.
gatley
held
in
his
hand
a
xerox
copy
of
the
third
circuit
of
the
ronson
against
liquifin
decision
and
i
believe
if
i
recall
correctly
you
read
a
passage
from
it.
the
waiver
was
the
peg
to
hang
ones
hat
upon
and
we
could
not
expect
the
district
court
to
reverse
the
circuit
by
a
frontal
attack
upon
the
propriety
of
the
1864
statute,
either
as
implied
repeal,
which
i
still
maintain
is
our
second
leg
or
the
cooperation
between
the
two
of
the
supplementary
effect,
the
either
or
situation.
justices
black
and
douglas,
may
they
rest
in
peace,
did
have
this
interesting
concurrence
in
the
michigan
national
bank
case
in
which
they
spoke,
they
tried
to
get
around
it
by
claiming
that
there
was
a
waiver
situation,
because
the
bank
came
across
the
state
line
to
do
business
and
conferred
its
self
in
the
new
state.
the
problem
that
we
do
have
with
our
adversaries
is
that
historically
they
have
taken
the
position
that
the
national
bank
act
of
64
is
mandatory
and
we
insist
it
is
mandatory
only
against
a
state
conflicting
decision.
it
is
not
mandatory
against
another
special
venue
provision.
now,
a
perfect
example,
although
we
have
not
found
case
law
in
this
court
on
two
special
venue
statutes,
is
the
jurisdiction
question.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
i
am
sorry
sir.
may
i
close
with
one
sentence,
sir?
mr.
ira
jay
sands
thank
you.
i
would
suggest,
i
will
urge
that
any
doubts
be
resolve
in
favor
of
lessening
the
burden
of
duplicative
litigation.
we
have
the
amel
(ph)
against
united
states
case,
which
came
from
the
court
of
claims,
a
multi
party
wage
claim
and
this
court
said,
“one
form
eliminates
any
problem
with
transferring
venue
from
several
district
courts
to
one
locale.
if
we
are
here
misconstruing
the
intent
of
congress
--”
mr.
ira
jay
sands
no
sir.
mr.
ira
jay
sands
it
can
easily
set
the
matter
to
rest
by
new
congressional
explicit
language.
thank
you
sir.
