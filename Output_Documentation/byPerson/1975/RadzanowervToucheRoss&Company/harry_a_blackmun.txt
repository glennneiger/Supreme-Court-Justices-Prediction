justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
sands
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
actually
considered
national
banks
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
securities
acts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
direct
my
question,
however,
to
the
venue
provisions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
the
waiver
not
in
the
question
presented,
but
you
talked
about
it
elsewhere
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
gave
much
greater
emphasis
to
it
in
the
district
court
than
you
have
here
in
your
brief?
