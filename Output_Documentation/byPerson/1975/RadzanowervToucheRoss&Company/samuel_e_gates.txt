mr.
samuel
e.
gates
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
appearing
for
the
respondent
first
national
bank
of
boston
only.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
set
the
record
straight
in
the
posture
of
this
case.
before
the
lower
courts,
the
only
issue
raised
by
petitioner
in
this
case
was
one
of
waiver.
the
allegations
of
this
complaint,
a
charge
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
section
10
(b),
the
new
york
state
statute
and
the
common
law
and
that
arose
out
of
the
latest
issue
and
some
false
misleading
statements
by
teleprompter
inc,
which
have
been
developed
as
a
result
as
a
formal
complaint
and
investigation
by
the
sec,
where
upon
a
class
action
was
brought
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
plaintiff
purported
to
bring
the
action
under
the
venue
provisions
of
section
27
of
the
exchange
act.
that
complaint
does
not
allege
that
the
bank
which
was
the
agent
bank
in
a
$150
million
credit
loan
agreement
had
anything
to
do
with
the
latest
issue
of
the
false
statements.
it
does
not
allege
that
the
bank
purchased
and
sold
teleprompter
stock
or
that
made
any
profit
out
of
any
of
the
transactions
complained
off.
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
and
the
cause
of
action
against
the
bank,
as
i
see
it
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
right
is
that
the
bank
is
a
alleged
to
have
aided
and
abet
the
other
defendants.
and,
it
reached
this
fiduciary
obligations
to
the
investing
public,
because
it
did
not
disclose
to
the
sec,
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
the
public
generally
some
information
which
it
had
learned
as
a
lending
bank
and
which
is
alleged
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
statements
issued
by
the
teleprompter.
where
upon,
relying
upon
this
court’s
decisions
in
langdeau
and
robertson,
which
makes
mandatory
the
application
of
section
94,
we
moved
under
as
rule
12
and
section
94
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
proper
venue.
at
this
point
your
honors,
may
i
say,
i
want
to
make
our
position
perfectly
clear.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
exchange
act
does
not
apply
to
a
national
bank.
we
are
saying
only
that
the
venue
must
be
laid
in
the
district
where
the
bank
is
established.
whatever
rights
the
petitioner
may
have
here,
he
can
pursue
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
now,
petitioner
has
conceded
that
the
bank
is
established
in
boston
and
indeed
as
it
has
been
since
1864,
right
after
the
national
banking
act
was
put
into
effect.
and,
he
conceded
in
his
affidavit,
which
appears
at
page
77
(a)
of
the
appendix,
that
under
normal
circumstances,
section
94
of
the
national
bank
act
would
prevent
a
bank
foreign
to
this
meaningless
southern
district
from
being
sued
in
the
southern
district,
but
they
argued
because
the
bank
had
qualified
under
section
131
(3)
of
the
new
york
banking
law
to
engage
in
a
limited
fiduciary
capacity
in
its
activities
in
new
york
that
constituted
an
in
test
waiver.
now,
this
was
the
issue
which
was
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
there
have
been
no
waiver.
petitioner
appealed
to
the
second
circuit,
again
on
the
issue
of
waiver.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
it
was
not
your
honor;
it
was
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs.
at
no
time
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
any
of
this
record
until
you
get
to
the
oral
argument
before
the
second
circuit
is
there
ever
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
might
be
some
conflict
between
section
27
and
section
94.
there
is
not
one
word
of
implied
repeal
or
repeal
by
implication.
only
when
it
got
to
oral
argument
was
the
ronson
case,
decided
by
the
third
circuit
in
1973
ever
mentioned.
and
then,
when
it
was
mentioned
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
he
did
not
urge
that
as
a
basis
for
an
implied
repeal.
he
did
not
rely
upon
it
on
that
basis
at
all.
now,
petitioner
has
agreed
and
answered
the
questions
from
mr.
justice
white
that
is
effect
he
has
abandoned
his
argument
of
waiver.
i
submit
your
honors
please
that
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
question
which
appears
on
page
3
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
see
that
there
is
a
single
question
positive
and
that
question
--
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
well,
yes
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
i
am
well
aware
that
this
court
has
the
right
to
--
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
i
understand
that
justice
white
that
you
have
that,
but
i
suggest
that
on
this
record
and
i
say
with
no
disrespect,
that
certiorari
was
improperly
granted.
it
was
not
passed
upon
by
the
district
court
or
the
circuit
court
and
as
i
understand
certiorari,
a
matter
is
brought
here
for
your
review.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
none
whatsoever
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
henry
friendly
in
bruns
against
nordeman,
followed
by
the
decision
of
clyde
(ph)
against
power
(ph),
i
can
see
no
possibility
that
second
taking
it
for
a
review
and
as
a
matter
a
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
both
in
1970
and
1972
had
precisely
this
issue
--
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
i
think
it
would
presumptuous
mr.
justice
white
for
me
to
tell
you
what
this
court
ought
to
do
and
i
would
therefore
refrain
from
responding,
but
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
at
the
time
of
the
argument,
before
the
second
circuit,
judge
mulligan,
who
was
the
presiding
judge
turned
to
mr.
gatley
(ph)
and
said,
“counsel,
are
you
suggesting
that
this
court
reconsider
or
overrule
its
decision
in
bruns
against
nordeman
and
mr.
gatley
responded
in
the
negative
that
he
was
not
asking
that
that
be
done.
i
submit
that
on
the
law
as
developed
in
this
area.
going
back
a
great
many
years,
but
referring
specifically
to
your
opinion
mr.
justice
white
in
langdeau
followed
by
robertson
and
the
cases
that
have
followed
subsequent
to
that,
that
there
is
no
need
to
repeal,
particularly
when
you
say
the
subsidy
provision
of
the
act
can
be
applied.
granted
there
maybe
some
inconvenience,
granted
there
may
be
some
hardship,
but
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
the
hardship
is
much,
much
less
than
it
was
in
michigan
national
bank
against
robertson
and
if
we
are
going
to
decide
that
repeal
by
implication
is
to
be
determined
by
the
hardship,
it
would
concrete
of
the
decisions
that
have
come
down
from
this
court
in
the
past.
let
me
move
from
this
question
of
fact
that
i
have
some
doubt
of
whether
i
should
be
here
today,
i
know
i
am,
let
me
try
to
deal
with
this
question
of
implied
repeal
a
little
bit.
this
court
has
not
directly
passed
on
the
question
which
the
petitioner
posits
here
today.
i
am
frank
to
say
that
there
is
such
a
shift
in
position
that
occurs
with
respect
to
this
petition
that
i
am
not
sure
just
what
i
am
called
upon
to
respond
to.
in
the
lower
courts
we
were
talking
about
waiver.
the
petitioner
for
certiorari
talks
about
the
broader
provisions
of
the
securities
law
prevailing
over
the
narrow
provisions
of
the
banking
act
or
can
they
co-exist
and
then
in
the
reply
brief
we
get
a
completely
different
--
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
when
we
recessed
at
the
luncheon
recess
that
i
was
about
to
say
that
in
bruns,
nordeman,
then
chief
judge
friendly
relying
upon
this
court’s
decisions
in
borden,
robertson
and
langdeau
found
that
there
were
no
basis
for
implied
repeal.
mr.
sands
this
morning
in
his
brief
said
and
attempted
to
differentiate
at
least
langdaeu
and
robertson
on
the
grounds
that
they
only
have
state
statutes
involved.
now,
that
precise
question
was
presented
to
judge
friendly
at
the
second
circuit
and
what
i
think
was
a
very
careful
analysis,
he
rejected
that
argument,
saying
in
these
words,
“it
would
indeed
strain
language
to
say
that
the
same
verbs
are
merely
permissive
with
respect
to
suites
in
federal
courts,
although
prohibitory
as
to
actions
in
state
courts.”
now,
clearly
section
27
--
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
that
is
not
my
recollection
--
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
i
will
stand
corrected
if
i
am
in
error.
clearly
section
27
does
not
by
its
express
terms
repeal
section
94,
nor
did
congress
say
as
petitioner
has
asserted
in
his
reply
brief
that
enacting
the
34
act
and
i
quote,
“congress
intended
that
a
national
bank
in
the
securities’
case
could
be
sued
in
certain,
specified
additional
act
districts.”
petitioner
admittedly
get
no
help
from
the
legislative
history.
he
has
acknowledged
this
morning
that
he
can
make
only
an
implicit
argument.
what
he
argues
that
the
two
statues
can
co-exist,
but
the
principal
thrust
of
his
opening
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
implied
repeal
of
section
94
can
be
found,
because
the
broad
public
interest
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
securities
act
required
it.
the
1934
congress
was
consumer
concerned
that
the
1934
act
was
meant
to
supersede
any
earlier
conflicting
statutes.
but
suffice,
we
are
able
to
ascertain
nothing
supports
these
assertions
except
the
(inaudible)
of
counsel.
but
they
go
even
farther
at
page
16
of
the
opening
brief
and
they
say,
“congress'
silence
evidences
its
intent
in
1934
to
impose
the
venue
provisions
of
the
1934
act
on
all
concerned.”
we
can
find
no
case
from
this
or
any
other
court,
which
supports
the
thesis
that
silence,
will
support
implied
repeal.
however,
as
mr.
sands
has
acknowledged
this
morning,
the
sec
in
its
brief
makes
a
completely
different
argument,
saying
that
the
adherence
to
the
decisions
of
the
second
and
ninth
circuits
would
frustrate
the
policy
of
the
‘34
act
and
would
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
the
enforcement
activities
of
the
commission.
i
would
remind
this
court
that
the
1934
act
has
been
in
effect
for
42
years,
yet
the
commission
in
its
brief
does
not
cite
a
single
instance
where
a
resort
by
a
national
bank
to
the
provisions
of
section
94
as
evinced
upon
or
interfered
or
adversely
affected
the
commission’s
enforcement
activities.
the
sole
justification
advanced
in
support
of
this
thesis
is
that
the
commission
may
be
unable
some
day
to
join
some
national
bank
in
some
unidentified
future
enforcement
procedures.
an
argument
was
made
just
ten
years
ago,
before
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
an
action
entitled
general
electric
credit
corporation
against
(inaudible),
where
the
commission
again
filed
an
amicus
brief.
the
department
of
justice
representing
the
controller
of
currency
took
an
opposite
point
of
view.
judge
tanny
made
a
very
careful
survey
of
the
situation
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
to
support
the
conclusion
of
implied
repeal.
now,
in
somewhat
different
context,
but
i
submit
a
similar
situation,
mr.
justice
white
in
writing
for
this
court
said
in
mercantile
national
bank,
that
this
was
a
problem
for
congress
to
consider.
it
was
not
a
problem
for
this
court.
one
would
have
thought
had
been
in
fact
an
interference
with
the
commission's
enforcement
activities
during
the
last
40
years
that
they
would
have
gone
to
congress
and
sought
help.
they
have
not
been
reluctant
to
do
so
in
the
past,
but
they
have
not
done
so
here.
whatever
maybe
the
speculative
views
of
petitioner
as
to
the
intentions
of
congress
or
whatever
the
sec
believes
are
the
controlling
policy
considerations.
we
have
been
unable
to
find
any
support
in
any
decisions
from
this
court,
which
will
sustain
an
argument
for
implied
repeal.
to
the
contrary,
this
court
consistently
taken
the
view
that
absent
a
waiver
by
a
bank,
the
section
94
mandates
that
all
transitory
actions
shall
be
brought
only
in
the
district
where
the
bank
is
established.
in
order
to
sustain
implied
repeal,
there
are
two
cardinal
precepts
as
we
read
the
cases,
which
must
be
undertaken
and
established
by
the
petitioners.
one;
there
must
be
a
clear
and
manifest
intent
to
repeal
and
two;
there
must
be
a
positive
repugnance
or
an
irreconcilable
conflict.
we
find
neither
of
those
present
in
this
situation.
there
is
nothing
to
support
in
our
judgment,
clear
and
manifest
intent
to
repeal.
in
an
effort
to
buttress
the
arguments
of
the
petitioner
and
its
own
arguments,
the
sec
in
its
brief
refers
to
the
report
of
senator
fletcher
of
the
senate
banking
and
currency
committee
and
says
that
this
sustains
the
position.
i
submit
that
the
fletcher
report
is
completely
irrelevant
to
this
arguments.
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
senate
of
the
united
states
until
after
the
34
act
had
become
law
and
it
made
no
recommendations
of
any
kind
with
respect
to
immediate
legislation.
now,
certainly
at
the
time
that
the
1934
act
was
adopted,
congress
was
aware
and
this
is
conceded
by
petitioner,
of
the
special
status
which
congress
has
granted
to
national
banks,
going
back
to
1864.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
it
would
have
been
very
considerable
assistance
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
we
had
found
something
like
that,
but
we
have
found
nothing
of
that
in
nature
to
indicate
that
there
was
any
real
consideration
given
to
this
particular
issue.
it
is
quite
true
that
the
congress
was
concerned
about
abuses
which
have
been
developing
and
existed
in
the
securities
industry,
but
they
were
also
well
aware
of
the
special
status
of
national
banks.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
well,
i
suppose
one
can
make
that
argument,
i
do
not
happen
to
subscribe
to
it,
based
upon
the
decisions
which
have
emanated
from
this
court,
but
certainly,
conceptually
one
can
make
that
argument
and
i
would
be
lacking
in
candor
if
i
did
not
acknowledge
it.
but,
i
cannot
believe
that
simply
by
enacting
section
27
and
by
silence
that
it
can
be
properly
construed
that
congress
intended
to
amend
or
repeal
section
94,
but
to
petitioner
it
seems
to
me
at
more
difficult
burden
in
sustaining
implied
repeal
in
that
he
must
show
positive
repugnance
or
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
two
statutes.
and,
i
submit
that
petitioner
has
made
no
attempt
at
such
a
showing.
in
his
reply
brief
at
page
3,
he
concedes
that
implied
repeal
is
more
difficult
to
establish,
than
what
he
terms
co-existence.
i
think
it
might
have
been
might
be
a
little
accurate
if
he
had
said
it
was
impossible,
under
these
circumstances
to
establish
implied
repeal.
and
then,
on
the
next
page
of
his
reply
brief,
that
is
on
page
4,
under
the
heading,
the
two
venue
statutes
are
supplementary
and
not
in
conflict.
he
apparently
abandons
any
effort
at
showing
repugnance
and
he
characterizes
this
as
the
major
point
of
his
argument.
he
said
this
morning
there
is
no
reason
why
they
cannot
co-exist,
a
position
which
is
diametrically
opposed
to
that
of
the
sec,
which
pep
the
entire
brief
that
it
submitted
as
amicus
in
establishing
that
there
was
repugnance
and
a
direct
conflict.
i
submit
that
when
petitioner
is
talking
about
harmonization
of
the
two
statues
that
you
can
make
them
each
effective
in
its
own
sphere.
he
is
engaged
in,
if
i
may
use
a
colloquialism,
kidding
himself.
he
asserts
that
each
special
statutes
is
a
special
grant
by
congress
to
a
forum
and
that
more
than
one
statutes
applies,
a
plaintiff
has
the
benefit
of
both
and
he
can
make
his
choice,
that
is
of
section
27
or
section
94.
with
respect
that
i
suggest
that
if
that
were
the
law,
and
in
the
situation
there
would
be
no
need
for
us
to
be
here
today.
i
would
suggest
also
that
even
if
he
is
correct,
the
fact
that
he
may
make
the
choice
does
not
mean
that
he
is
going
to
be
able
to
stay
in
that
forum,
because
section
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
is
still
in
the
books.
it
my
well
be
that
a
defendant
can
invoke
the
provisions
of
that
section.
i
submit
that
petitioner
is
really
not
asking
for
harmonization.
he
is
asking
for
an
exception,
an
implied
repeal
section
94,
where
securities
act
law
violations
are
charged
and
he
would
equate
such
exception
to
that
exception
recognized
by
this
court
with
respect
to
purely
local
actions
in
cassey
against
adams
(ph).
as
i
have
indicated
and
as
mr.
sands
agrees,
the
commission
that
is
not
on
the
court
with
petitioner's
view
is
that
the
two
statutes
can
co-exist.
rather
he
argues
that
the
two
venues
statutes
are
in
direct
and
irreconcilable
conflict
and
the
section
27
supersedes
section
94.
it
says
that
they
are
repugnant
in
both
their
policies
and
their
practical
effects.
however,
he
does
concede
that
if
section
94
prevails
then
bank
can
be
sued
only
in
boston.
it
seems
to
me
that
by
making
such
concession,
it
is
an
overt
admission
that
the
exchange
act
can
be
made
to
work
against
the
bank
in
boston.
now,
in
attempting
to
establish
repugnance,
the
commission
relies
on
two
cases
decided
by
this
court
only
last
june.
gordon
against
new
york
stock
exchange
and
united
states
against
nasd.
he
argues
that
section
94
has
been
impliedly
repealed
by
section
27,
because
such
repeal
is
necessary
in
this
case
to
make
the
federal
record
choice
scheme
work
in
the
securities
industry.
in
that
regard,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
overlooks
silver
against
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
which
says
that
if
there
is
repeal
by
implication,
it
will
be
granted
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
make
the
act
work
and
then,
only
to
the
minimum.
but,
those
two
cases
if
the
court
please,
i
submit
are
distinguishable.
in
each
of
those
cases
the
requirements
of
implied
repeal
had
been
clearly
satisfied.
in
order
to
make
the
regulatory
scheme
work
as
envisioned
by
congress
with
respect
to
fixed
rate
commissions
and
with
respect
to
the
sales
and
distribution
of
mutual
funds,
this
court
held
that
the
anti-trust
laws
have
to
give
way.
there
was
no
way
to
reconcile
the
restrictive
agreements,
which
were
developed
in
the
securities
industry
with
the
anti-trust
laws,
the
scheme
that
been
envisaged
by
congress.
but,
there
is
nothing
in
the
case
at
bar,
which
makes
these
holdings
opposite.
as
i
said
earlier
the
substantive
provisions
of
this
law
can
work
in
boston
as
well
as
they
can
in
new
york.
the
bank
is
not
immune
from
the
terms
of
the
securities
laws
nor
is
it
exempt
from
potential
liability
that
violates
the
terms.
we
say
only
that
the
issue
whether
it
violated
the
term
should
be
determined
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
rather
in
the
district
of
new
york.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
there
is
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
am
frank
to
tell
you
the
name
of
it
escapes
me.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
i
understand
that
located
equates
itself
to
what
i
would
term
what
might
be
the
principal
place
of
business,
if
you
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
general
corporate
law.
whereas
established
which
is
the
word
which
is
used
with
respect
to
a
national
bank,
being
sued
in
a
federal
context
i
understand
it
means
the
place
where
its
charter
says
that
it
is
established,
the
home
office.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white,
but
as
i
interpret
the
statute,
as
i
have
understood
from
the
decisions
from
this
and
other
courts,
the
word
locate
relates
itself
to
actions,
which
are
brought
in
state
courts
and
that
is
where
the
bank
must
be
located.
whereas
you
are
talking
about
actions
in
the
federal
court,
the
word
establish
is
used.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
well,
then
under
you
honor’s
decision
in
langdeau
i
do
not
think
we
have
any
problem.[laughter]
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
well,
there
were
145
defendants
in
that
action
of
which
two
were
national
banks
and
in
an
opinion
written
by
your
honor
you
said
that
they
had
to
be
go
to
another
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
that
is
also
correct.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
i
have
to
tell
you
i
do
not.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
samuel
e.
gates
it
has
--
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
thank
you
very
much.
