mr.
sands,
you
say
in
one
instance
and
you
are
talking
of
course
about
the
34
act,
but
15
u.s.c.
77
v,
the
33
act,
and
the
interstate
land
sales
regulation,
there
are
certainly
are
other
acts
giving
general
venue
for
specific
courses
of
action,
which
would
be
effective
by
a
decision
in
this
case,
are
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
there
were
no
national
banks
until
1863,
before
that
it
was
the
bank
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
point
may
not
be
important
to
your
argument,
but
i
did
not
mean
to
have
you
spend
a
real
good
time
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
you
abandon
your
waiver
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
maybe
you
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
notice
you
did
not
cite
the
nearble
case
308
u.s.
where
this
court
held
that
there
had
been
a
waiver
by
a
corporate
defendant
of
a
right
to
be
sued
under
the
statute,
by
filing
of
a
consent
to
service
of
process,
not
too
different
from
that
in
our
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
nearble
(ph)
argued
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gates
would
it
had
been
sufficient
in
your
view,
dealing
with
the
repeal
intent,
if
somebody
had
got
up
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
said
that
the
34
act
venue
provision
is
broad
and
we
mean
it
to
apply
just
in
its
literal
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
if
it
would
have
been
sufficient
instead
of
get
on
the
floor
and
say
that
why
is
not
even
more
impressive
that
they
used
broad,
general
language
in
the
statute
itself?
