justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
not
--
you
have
not
raised
the
waiver
issue
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
question
presented
--
subsumes
the
waiver
issue?
you
present
one
question,
should
not
there
be
important
once
brought
a
serious
conflict
by
declaring
the
more
liberal
venue
provisions
of
securities
act
prevail
over
the
stringent
national
bank
act,
that
is
the
question
that
you
presented?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
include
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
end
of
the
waiver
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
did
not
add
certiorari
on
that
question,
because
it
was
not
presented?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
is
is
quite
error
somehow?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
implying
that
that
question
is
not
properly
here
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
made
this
very
argument
in
your
opposition
for
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
granted
the
petition
with
that
single
question
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
we
nevertheless,
we
had
this
very
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
have
any
doubt
how
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
would
have
decided
the
issue
that
is
now
stated
that
was
stated
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
we
ought
to
send
this
case
--
to
dismiss
for
petition
for
cert
as
improperly
granted
or
vacated
and
remand
so
that
the
second
circuit
may
tell
us
what
the
answer
to
this
question
is
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
some
case
in
this
court
construing
the
word
located
in
section
94?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
actually
been
decided
here
that
located
means
the
place
of
its
incorporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
means
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
says
that
the
or
in
any
state
county
or
municipal
court
in
the
county
or
city
in
which
the
said
association
is
located?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
this
action
has
been
brought
under
state
law
in
a
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
case
did
not
focus
on
location,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
big
issue
in
langdeau
is
whether
it
was
exclusive,
whether
that
venue
provision
was
--
whether
the
word
may
must
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
it
did
not
really
go
to
the
question
what
the
meaning
of
located
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
again
i
ask
you,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
construes
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you.
