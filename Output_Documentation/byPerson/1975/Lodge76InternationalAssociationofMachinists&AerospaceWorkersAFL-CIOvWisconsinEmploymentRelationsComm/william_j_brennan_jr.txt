justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
during
negotiations
for
renewal
of
an
expired
collective
bargaining
agreement,
petitioner
union
and
it's
members
engaged
and
a
concerted
refusal
to
work
overtime.
the
employer
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
but
that
charge
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
refusal
to
work
overtime
did
not
violate
the
national
labor
relation's
act,
and
therefore,
was
not
conduct
cognizable
by
the
board.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
employer
had
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
with
the
respondent
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission
and
that
commission
held
that
the
refusal
to
work
overtime,
while
neither
protected
nor
prohibited
by
the
national
labor
relation's
act,
was
nevertheless
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
state
law
and
the
commission,
therefore,
entered
a
cease
and
desist
order
against
the
union.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
affirmed.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
union's
concerted
refusal
to
work
overtime
was
peaceful
conduct
constituting
activity
free
not
only
of
national
labor
relations
board
regulation,
but
also
free
of
state
regulation.
congress
meant
that
self
help
economic
activities,
whether
of
employer
or
employee,
were
not
to
be
regulable
by
states
anymore
then
by
the
national
labor
relation's
board.
