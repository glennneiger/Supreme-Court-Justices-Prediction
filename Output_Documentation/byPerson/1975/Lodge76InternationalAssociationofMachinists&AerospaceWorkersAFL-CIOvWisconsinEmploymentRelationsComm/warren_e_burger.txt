chief
justice

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-185,
international
association
of
machinists
against
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission.
mr.
miller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
matter
would
seem
mr.
miller
if
the
statute
was
directed
against
a
typical
“sit-down”
that
is
occupying
the
premises?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
suggesting
a
statute
that
goes
to
the
subject
of
violence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
miller.
mr.
come
before
you
get
on
the
way
to
answer
this
question
under
the
hypothetical
variation.
suppose
the
employees
decided
the
way
they
handle
this
problem
was
to
work
four
hours
a
day,
five
days
a
week.
that
would
make
it
probably
i
think
you
would
agree
not
feasible
to
bring
in
another
good
work
the
other
to
round
out
the
work
week.
do
you
think
that
would
be
protected
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mallatt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
told
us
earlier
and
clarify
it
if
i
misunderstood
you
that
if
there
was
a
refusal
collectively
to
work
overtime
that
was
not
protected,
but
individually
it
would
be
protected.
now
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
i
did
not
think
you
made
that
distinction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
that
if
one
employee
that
will
not
work
overtime;
he
could
be
fired
and
replaced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
it
is
not
practical
to
replace
several
hundred
people,
it
has
been
known
that
people
had
been
replaced
in
hundreds,
200s,
300s,
some
of
that
very
close
to
it
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
milwaukee
is
a
bigger
city
than
washington,
d.c.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
suggest
that
you
fire
every
ten
employee
and
making
sure
that
by
coincidence
not
too
many
of
the
number
10
people
where
shut
towards
or
some
sectioning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
self-help
is
self-destructive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
at
this
point
at
2
o’clock.
mr.
mallatt
you
may
continue,
you
have
about
seven
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
part
of
your
answer
to
be
that
this
is
a
matter
up
to
the
states
if
they
want
to
get
the
benefit,
kind
of
the
law
wisconsin
has,
they
can
do
what
some
of
the
states
did
as
a
right
to
work
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
mallatt.
you
have
one
minute
left
on
your
side
of
the
table
counsel,
if
you
wish
to
use
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-185,
lodge
76
of
the
international
association
of
machinists
against
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
committee
would
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
