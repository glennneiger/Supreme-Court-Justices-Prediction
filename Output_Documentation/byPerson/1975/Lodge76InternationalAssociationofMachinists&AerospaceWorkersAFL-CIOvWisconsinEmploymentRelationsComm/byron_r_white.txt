justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
legal
argument
going
to
be
that
this
is
actually
protected
activity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
first
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
is
actually
protected
activity?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
your
first
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
means
that
the
court
should
reach
whether
it
is
actually
protected
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that
argument
indicates
that
you
should.
if
you
say
that
is
your
first
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
forget
briggs-stratton
for
a
minute.
will
you
just
talk
about
the
federal
labor
law,
what
is
your
first
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
is
that
generally
a
state
intervention
in
the
area
is
generally
preempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
federal
labor
policy
in
this
area
is
no
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
government
should
not
touch
it.
i
think
government
should
not
touch
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
point,
is
your
next
argument
that
is
actually
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
that
it
is
arguably
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
argue
the
arguably
protected
point
at
all.
i
gather
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
your
first
point,
you
then
say,
we
should
look
and
see
if
whether
it
is
actually
protected
of
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
first
point.
i
understand,
i
think
do.
what
if
i
disagree
with
you?
what
if
we
disagree
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you,
was
there
an
injunction
issued
in
this
case
or
was
there
a
state
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
unions
that
removed
the
case
to
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
had
been
removed
that
issue
instantly
the
question
of
injunction
is
not
under
the
norris-laguardia,
would
have
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
was
under
the
wisconsin
law
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about,
what
if
the
dispute
were
an
arbitrable
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
a
collective
bargaining
for
a
new
contract,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
not
really
responsive
to
your
friend’s
argument
that
as
a
general
manner
there
is
preemption
here
in
insurance
agents
sense?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
the
argument
from
the
other
side
is
whether
this
is
--
even
if
this
is
not
protected
and
even
if
it
is
not
prohibited
the
state
cannot
touch
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
on
that
basis,
it
would
not
make
any
difference
whether
you
got
access
to
the
board
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
a
question
of
limiting
garmon,
that
is
another
issue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
better,
i
think
if
that
is
the
question
of
the
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
know,
but
you
started
out
by
saying
in
this
case
it
does
no
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
required
or
not.
now,
let
us
assume
it
was
not
required,
that
overtime
as
this
frequently
the
case
is
optional.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
do
you
say?
can
he
be
fired
for
saying,
i
will
not
work
overtime?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
concerted,
but
could
you
then
fire
him
for
doing
it
in
a
concerted
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
made
a
written
rule
that
overtime
is
required
and
people
refuse
to
obey
it,
i
suppose
you
could
discharge
them
and
replace
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
wisconsin
court’s,
was
there
a
finding
in
the
courts
on
whether
it
was
required
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary?
my
question
was
did
they
find
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary
or
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
probably
as
usual
confused.
if
you
say
the
activity
that
that
overtime
was
required
and
that
these
people
were
breaking
then
a
work
rule
and
therefore
you
had
the
right
to
fire
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
do
you
not
just
discharge
them
and
replace
them
like
you
would
in
general
strike,
rather
than
trying
to
seek
some
general
relief
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
that
may
be
so
and
if
the
union
struck,
i
suppose,
generally,
you
would
probably
have
to
--
you
would
be
shut
down,
would
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
fire
a
few.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
are
really
right
that
you
have
the
right
to
discharge
here,
i
do
not
know
why
you
are
really
getting
very
much
trouble
picking
and
choosing,
or
if
you
did
every
tenth
or
every
third
or
something?
the
union
is
stopping
short
of
closing
you
down
completely,
and
the
question
if
they
could
use
stop
short
of
a
total
discharge
or
a
total
lockout?
