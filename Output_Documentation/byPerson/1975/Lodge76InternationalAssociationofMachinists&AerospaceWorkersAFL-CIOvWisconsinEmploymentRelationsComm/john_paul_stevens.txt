justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
you
say
if
they
all
said
they
are
going
to
go
home
a
half
hour
early?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
searching
for
mr.
miller
and
i
am
sure
you
will
spill
it
up
before
you
get
through
is
what
is
the
bright
line
that
makes
this
difference
in
kind
from
briggs-stratton
and
trespass.
it
is
not
peacefulness
versus
violence,
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
go
that
far,
that
is
overruling
briggs-stratton?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
dissenters
in
briggs-stratton
thought
it
was
protected
activity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
issue
about
prohibiting
the
conduct
or
was
it
merely
a
question
whether
it
was
consistent
with
the
good
faith
bargaining?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
come,
if
i
understand
your
argument
is
a
little
broader
than
mr.
millerâ€™s.
you
take
the
position
that
all
nonviolent
collective
activity
in
connection
with
collective
bargaining
is
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
it
you
get
them
out
of
that
extreme
form
of
conduct
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
preempted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mallatt,
i
think
the
question
is
why
is
this
different
in
an
all
out
strike?
do
those
arguments
not
equally
apply
to
the
strike
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
not
also
happen
in
a
slow-down
and
discharge,
would
not
the
same
thing
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
middle
ground
on
your
response?
i
am
not
sure
you
answered
mr.
justice
white.
would
there
be
a
legal
objection
to
discharge
of
a
handful
of
employees
out
of
the
350
or
do
you
have
to
discharge
either
all
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
that
counter
argument
is
that
if
you
make
the
union
fish
or
cut
bait
on
the
two
extreme
alternatives,
that
they
may
find
they
have
to
strike
instead
of
engaging
in
some
lesser
activity
like
this.
does
the
argument
not
--
the
same
argument
can
be
made
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
it
seems
to
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
not
unilaterally
adopt
a
new
overtime
program?
