mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act
against
employer
discharge.
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
from
the
fact
that
it
is
not
protected
by
section
7
against
employer
discharge
that
the
state
under
our
labor
relation
statute
would
be
empowered
to
prohibit
it.
i
think
that
that
was
insurance
agents
because
in
that
case,
as
the
court
may
recall
these
agents
engaged
in
a
series
of
partial
strike
which
involved
reporting
late
and
leaving
on
their
own
time
and
the
court,
although
it
was
willing
to
accept
the
board’s
concession
that
that
would
not
be
protected
by
section
7
in
the
sense
that
the
employer
could
discharge
them,
nevertheless
found
that
the
board
could
not
without
upsetting
the
balance
of
economic
weaponry
that
congress
had
left
go
farther
and
prohibit
it.
and
i
submit
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
insurance
agent
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
board
could
find
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
the
bargain.
however,
in
finding
that
the
board
could
not
through
8
(b)
(3)
outlaw
this
conduct
because
of
its
own
feeling
that
this
was
more
effective
than
a
strike
and
hurt
an
employer
more
than
a
strike
would,
the
rationale
of
the
court’s
holding
is
based
upon
a
consideration
of
the
economic
weapons
that
were
left
in
reserve
at
the
bargaining
table
and
the
court
concluded
that
although
congress
had
regulated
the
use
of
economic
weapons
for
particular
objectives,
its
failure
to
specifically
prohibit
the
use
of
this
tactic
indicated
an
intention
to
leave
it
to
the
parties
as
part
of
the
economic
weaponry
that
they
have
to
back-up
their
bargaining
demands.
so
that
although
insurance
agents
rested
on
8
(b)
(3),
the
rationale,
we
submit
of
it
goes
beyond
8
(b)
(3).
now,
i
would
like
to
just
back-up
a
moment
and
give
a
little
of
the
historical
background
here.
briggs-stratton
was
decided
27
years
ago
when
the
doctrine
of
preemption
was
in
its
infancy.
the
court
undertook
to
decide
for
itself
whether
activity
was
protected
by
section
7
or
prohibited
by
section
8
of
the
federal
act
and
on
finding
that
was
neither.
it
concluded
that
the
intermittent
work
stop
which
is
there
were
left
the
state
regulation.
now,
what
is
wrong
with
this
approach?
as
this
court
has
recognized
over
the
years,
is
it
that
it
required
the
courts
and
ultimately
this
court
to
decide
in
each
case
for
itself
whether
activity
was
prohibited
or
protected
and
this
was
a
difficult
task
that
congress
entrusted
primarily
to
the
board
to
determine
and
for
which
the
court
was
not
too
well-equipped
to
handle.
secondly,
it
overlooked
the
fact
that
congress
may
have
designedly
left
some
activity
unregulated
to
the
free
play
of
economic
forces.
now,
garmon
which
came
10
years
later
was
an
effort
to
deal
with
this
problem.
it
enunciated
the
test
that
whether
an
activity
is
arguably
subject
to
section
7
or
section
8
of
the
act,
the
states
as
well
as
the
federal
courts
are
ousted
of
jurisdiction
and
since
this
approach
was
inconsistent
with
briggs-stratton,
the
court
dropped
to
footnote
in
which
it
indicated
that
the
briggs-stratton
test
is
no
longer
of
general
application.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
on
the
garmon
opinion.
now,
garmon
has
been
easy
for
the
courts
to
apply
and
in
my
judgment
and
experience
it
has
worked
well
in
minimizing
state
intrusion
into
matters
that
are
clearly
regulated
by
the
national
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
i
am
getting
to
that.
however,
recently
some
members
of
the
court
have
indicated
a
disposition
to
reexamine
garmon
because
although
there
is
a
ready
means
of
getting
to
the
board
to
determine
whether
activity
is
prohibited
by
section
8,
in
order
to
get
a
board
determination
of
whether
it
is
protected
by
section
7,
the
employer
asked
to
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
in
some
cases
you
may
not
even
have
an
employer
involved.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
however,
we
believe
that
you
do
not
have
to
resolve
that
issue
here.
that
is
a
question
that
if
it
is
to
be
reexamined,
it
should
be
in
a
case
where
it
makes
a
difference
as
to
whether
or
not
a
finding
that
the
activity
is
not
protected
by
section
7
against
employer
discharge
would
leave
it
open
to
state
regulation.
now,
in
the
area
that
we
have
in
this
case
where
you
have
the
use
of
a
peaceful
economic
weapon
as
part
of
the
arsenal
of
weapons
that
are
used
at
the
bargaining
table,
i
submit
that
the
reasons
that
i
indicated
earlier,
insurance
agents
makes
it
plain
that
that
is
an
area
that
congress
left
to
the
free
play
of
economic
forces.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
because
no
matter
how
you
decide
that,
it
is
still
preempted
and
i
think
that
in
morton
case
which
came
in
1964,
indicates
that
where
you
are
dealing
with
the
type
of
activity
that
you
have
here
where
a
consequence
of
finding
that
it
is
not
protected
still
leaves
it
in
the
field
preempted
by
the
act,
the
proper
analysis
really
is
whether
or
not
it
is
preempted
and
in
morton
you
have
a
very
similar
situation.
instead
of
using
a
refusal
to
work
overtime
as
a
bargaining
weapon,
what
happened
was
that
the
union
appealed
to
the
customers
of
the
company
that
they
were
negotiating
with
for
a
voluntary
boycott.
voluntary
boycott
is
not
proscribed
by
the
national
act,
although
a
coercive
boycott
is.
the
state
of
ohio
gave
damages
for
that
and
this
court
found,
upset
that
damage
award
finding
that
do
so
even
though
this
was
not
protected
against
the
employer
discharge
by
section
7
would
upset
the
balance
of
power
and
similarly
here
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
i
submit
as
i
attempted
to
point
out
in
answer
to
justice
stevens’
inquiry
that
insurance
agent
shows
that
congress
did
focus
on
the
question
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
norton
j.
come
8
(b)
(3).
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
a
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
is
a
discrete
question,
but
the
root
by
which
the
court
came
to
that
conclusion
required
an
examination
of
the
basic
policies
of
collective
bargaining
that
congress
had
embodied
in
the
act
and
it
is
the
rationale
of
insurance
agents
which
we
submit
covers
this
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was
a
state
finding
or
unfair
labor
practice,
the
state
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
which
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
know.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
i
doubt
it
because
as
i
understand
removal,
you
have
to
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
and
if
you
are
going
to
turn
around
and
argue
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
is
preempted,
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
usually
that
is
why
when
we
have
a
preemption
problem,
if
we
are
not
appearing
the
state
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
unless
the
wisconsin
statute
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
this
was
under
the
wisconsin
law.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
basically
that
is
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
a
sit-down
strike,
i
would
say
by
practice
has
gotten
into
the
same
category
as
violence.
mr.
norton
j.
come
an
example
that
you
gave
me
of
going
home
early
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
that
would
be
preempted.
i
am
not
saying
that
that
would
be
protected
against
employer?
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
now
you
get
into
a
problem
of
whether
301
would
give
a
separate
set
of
remedies.
i
think
that
the
question
of
preemption
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
this
was.
the
contract
had
expired.
mr.
norton
j.
come
thank
you.
