mr.
gerry
m.
miller
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
the
question
it
poses
as
we
see
it
is
the
following;
whether
wisconsin
may,
consistent
with
supremacy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution,
outlaw
peaceful,
concertedly
refusals
to
work
optional
overtime
in
support
of
worker
collective
bargaining
demands.
a
self-help
pressure
permitted
under
the
balance
of
power
is
struck
by
congress
in
the
federal
labor
statute.
the
question
arises
on
these
facts.
the
company,
a
machine
tool
manufacturer
within
the
federal
labor
board’s
jurisdiction,
terminated
its
labor
agreement
with
the
union
in
june
of
1971.
at
that
time,
the
parties
had
reached
impasse
on
a
number
of
the
company’s
demands
for
changes
in
the
contract.
one
of
these
was
insistence,
the
company’s
insistence
on
increasing
basic
work
day
and
work
week
from
seven
and
one-half
to
eight
hours
a
day
and
thirty-seven-one-half
to
forty
hours
a
week
where
the
commensurate
reduction
in
over
time
pay.
on
march
1,
1972,
while
the
parties
were
still
in
impasse
on
this
and
other
issues,
the
company
announced
its
decision
to
implement
its
work
schedule
demands
unilaterally,
just
as
it
had
previously
changed
other
established
working
additions
some
months
before.
this
time,
the
union
responded
by
holding
a
meeting
on
march
7
at
which
the
membership
voted
to
seek
strike
sanction
from
the
international
union
and
unanimously
resolved
that
no
member
should
work
overtime
to
find
his
work
over
seven-and-one-half
hours
a
day
or
thirty-seven-one-half
hours
a
week.
though
the
company
continued
to
schedule
overtime
work
thereafter,
the
membership
resolution
was
observed
by
virtually
all
of
the
over
600
members
over
the
next
four
months
until
the
new
contract
was
settled
in
late
july.
faced
with
the
union’s
counter
to
it
self-help
initiative,
the
company
backed
off
from
implementing
its
work
day
and
work
week
demands.
the
impact
of
the
union’s
overtime
moratorium
was
to
cause
severe
economic
hardship
to
the
company
and
its
effort
to
deal
with
temporary
pulse
increases
in
production
loads
while
the
workers
lost
substantial
additional
earnings
that
they
would
have
receive
had
the
overtime
been
worked.
for
the
past
17
years,
k&t
employees,
the
company’s
employees
had
worked
the
seven-and-one-half
hour
work
day
and
thirty-seven
one-half
hour
work
week.
they
continued
to
do
so
throughout
the
period
march
through
july
1972,
in
other
words,
doing
over
time
moratorium.
by
custom
and
understanding
as
the
commission
found,
respondent
commission,
none
of
these
employees
had
been
required
to
work
daily
or
weekend
overtime
prior
to
the
march
7
membership
meeting.
admittedly,
since
acceptance
of
overtime
assignments
remained
optional
thereafter,
no
employee
who
concertedly
refused
to
accept
scheduled
overtime,
pursuant
to
the
moratorium
was
even
disciplined.
the
union
rejected
the
company
proposal
to
settle
the
controversy
by
the
company’s
differing
implementation
of
the
new
work
schedules,
if
the
union
would
agree
that
all
daily
overtime
would
now
become
part
of
the
regular
work
schedule
and
cannot
be
refused,
except
for
reasons
acceptable
to
supervision.
on
june
12,
1972,
during
the
overtime
moratorium
but
the
same
day
that
it
commenced
the
present
action,
the
company
filed
a
charge
with
the
nlrb,
alleging
in
part
that
union’s
overtime
moratorium
restrained
the
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights
and
violated
its
bargaining
duty
to
the
employer
under
sections
8
(b)
(1)
and
3
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
charge
was
dismissed
by
the
board’s
director
on
the
ground
that
the
overtime
refusals
were
not
violative
of
the
federal
statute.
the
director
cited
the
1960
decision
of
this
court
in
insurance
agents
international
union
where
various
concerted
interference
with
production
on
the
job
action
were
held
permissible
under
the
act
though
assumed
not
to
be
protected
from
employer
appraisal
by
section
7
of
the
national
act.
in
this
case,
in
our
case,
the
director
made
no
determination
as
to
whether
k&t
employees
lost
that
protection
by
collectively
exercising
the
right
to
reject
overtime
work
in
the
circumstances
here.
however,
the
state
commission
in
the
instant
proceeding
and
later
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
very
same
peaceful
self-help
activity
permitted
by
the
board’s
director
breached
the
wisconsin
labor
relations
statute
which
prohibits
workers
from
engaging
in
any
concerted
effort
to
interfere
with
production,
except
by
leaving
the
premises
in
an
orderly
manner
for
the
purpose
of
going
on
strike.
the
union’s
defense
of
federal
preemption
was
rejected
by
the
state
tribunals
on
grounds
that
the
conduct
was
neither
arguably
protected
nor
arguably
prohibited
by
the
federal
statute
and
on
the
authority
of
this
court’s
1947
decision
in
briggs-stratton
dealing
with
state
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
“quickie”
strikes
within
the
plenary
power
of
the
state
to
regulate.
that
states
the
case.
on
these
facts,
we
desire
to
emphasize
two
of
the
arguments
against
state
jurisdiction
presented
in
our
brief.
the
first,
that
briggs-stratton
is
plainly
distinguishable
from
this
case.
the
second
that
briggs-stratton
should
be
declared
overruled
or
limited
to
its
exact
facts
and
of
course
the
reason
supportive
of
the
latter
reinforce
the
former.
the
first
point;
without
reaching
any
issue
as
to
the
current
survival
of
any
prior
decision
of
this
court,
we
think
state
jurisdiction
must
yield
simply
because
the
quality
of
the
conduct
here
is
so
different
in
kind
from
that
which
is
hereto
for
ever
been
held
subject
to
state
prohibition
in
collective
bargaining.
please
contrast
if
--
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
not
be.
i
believe
--
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
i
think
physical
obstruction
of
a
plant
creates
a
series
of
state
interest
a
fortiori
of
course
to
trespass
that
amount
of
physical
obstruction,
the
exercise
of
physical
force
in
occupying
the
premises,
i
see
nothing
comparable
to
that
consideration
in
terms
of
state
interest
here,
contrast
to
violence,
the
property
damage,
the
bombings,
the
threats
and
other
disorder,
traditionally
subject
to
state
prohibition
with
entirely
peaceful
concerted
activity
of
the
workers
in
this
case.
consider
the
obvious
differences
between
the
sit-down
strikes
of
years
passed
and
even
the
more
recent
issues
as
to
state
jurisdiction
to
enforce
trespass
laws
respecting
private
property
in
labor
dispute
situations
with
the
entirely
authorized
and
orderly
conduct
of
the
workers
at
k&t’s
plants
here.
they
did
not
occupy
the
premises.
the
controversy
here
arose
when
the
employer
wanted
them
to
stay
longer
than
they
chose
to
stay.
third,
compare
the
conduct
in
briggs-stratton;
26
unauthorized
and
unannounced
mid-shift
union
meetings,
so
called,
supporting
unstated
demands
designed
so
that
management
could
not
predict
their
occurrence
and
plant
production
around
them
with
the
entirely
predictable
known
measured
and
we
might
even
say
subordinate
concerted
activity
in
this
case.
k&t’s
workers
arrived
at
work
at
the
appointed
time
each
day
for
four
months,
performed
their
work
without
interruption
and
with
customary
productivity
for
the
basic
work
day
and
work
week.
they
left
work
at
the
end
of
the
established
work
day
and
work
week
merely
exercising
collectively,
their
acknowledged
right,
acknowledged
by
the
employer
to
reject
scheduled
overtime
work.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
mr.
justice
stevens
that
would
present
a
different
situation.
in
this
case,
if
the
employer
were
to
authorize
that
or
condone
it,
or
to
somehow
fail
to
invoke
its
disciplinary
powers
to
counter
it,
i
would
think
that
that
case
presents
a
different
circumstance
than
this
case
does.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
absolutely
not.
there
i
believe
two
theories,
a
broad
and
a
narrow
theory,
either
of
which
is
sufficient
to
justify
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
the
narrow
theory
so-called
is
to
focus
on
the
character
of
the
conduct
here,
the
character
of
the
overtime,
the
nature
of
the
worker’s
response
and
say
this
is
right
at
the
heart
of
federal
concern,
the
kind
of
activity
for
which
there
is
no
state
interest
in
substituting
state
judgment
or
local
judgment
for
what
congress
has
done.
in
fact,
what
that
comes
down
the
same
very
closely
is
this
is
at
the
center
of
the
federal
concern
because
this
is
conduct
that
is
actually
protected
from
employer
reprisal
by
section
7
of
taft-hartley.
the
broader
theory
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
no,
i
do
not
think
briggs-stratton,
i
think
briggs-stratton
really
stands
today
for
a
very,
very
narrow
holding
to
the
extent
it
leaves
it
all
and
that
holding
is
that
in
conduct
--
that
the
conduct
of
the
union
of
briggs-stratton
was
so
crude
so
without
redeeming
interest
that
it
could
be
assimilated
to
the
character
of
violence
in
a
labor
dispute
or
physical
takeover
of
the
plant.
this
court
said
as
much
in
the
o’brien
case
cited
in
the
cio
brief.
it
analogized
what
it
had
been
saying
and
doing
in
briggs-stratton,
with
labor
dispute
violence,
physical
takeover,
physical
obstruction,
the
exercise
of
physical
force
in
a
sit-down
strike
situation.
to
that
extent,
perhaps
briggs-stratton
lives,
but
not
to
any
greater
extent
than
that.
i
do
not
think
anybody
can
say
that
the
activity
in
briggs-stratton
was
--
the
sit-down
strike
is
protected
from
employer
reprisal.
i
am
sure
violence
and
labor
dispute
is
not
so
protected
--
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
dissenters
in
briggs-stratton
and
of
course
that
was
a
very
early
decision
justice
stevens.
we
are
focusing
in
on
section
13
and
section
501
of
taft-hartley
as
whether
that
kind
or
whether
those
statutes
preempted
state
prohibition.
i
think
preemption
analysis
has
moved
a
great
deal
further
on
since
that
time.
i
think
i
would
have
to
concede
for
example
that
an
employer
self-help
weapon,
legal
under
federal
statute
such
as
a
lockout
for
example
is
the
very
kind
of
concern
at
the
heart
of
federal
labor
policy
that
a
state
may
not
directly
prohibit.
i
do
not
think
the
dissenters
in
briggs-stratton
were
focusing
on
that
kind
of
an
issue
at
all.
back
to
the
factual
analysis
here,
management
knew
in
advance
in
our
guess,
unlike
briggs-stratton,
precisely
what
to
expect,
when
to
you
expect
it
and
the
demands
that
it
furthered.
the
company
would
have
liked
to
have
had
the
overtime
as
well
just
as
the
workers
would
have
liked
to
have
the
wagers
payable
for
it,
but
the
parties
were
without
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
an
impasse
and
negotiations
and
economic
pressures
appropriate
to
resolve
the
stalemate.
in
some,
as
this
court
later
indicated
in
o’brien,
the
michigan
strike
board
case,
briggs-stratton
survives
if
at
all
only
with
respect
to
concerted
activities
that
can
be
fairly
assimilated
to
physical
takeover
of
the
plant
at
sit-down
strike.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
we
make
that
argument
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
our
narrow
argument
is
that
in
fact
in
this
case,
briggs-stratton
is
totally
an
opposite
because
the
conduct
is
so
close
to
the
center
of
federal
concern
as
to
in
fact
be
protected.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
yes
sir,
we
say
that.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
that
is
the
narrow
argument.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
the
court
need
not
reach
that
issue.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
well,
our
argument
–-
the
first
argument
is
that
because
this
conduct
is
so
different
from
briggs-stratton,
it
does
not
fall
within
the
rule.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
the
first
argument
is
your
honor
that
this
the
broad
argument
is
the
first
argument,
the
most
important
argument
and
that
is
that
this
is
a
self-help
activity
permitted
by
congress
in
taft-hartley.
it
is
therefore
part
of
the
balance
of
power
that
congress
struck
when
it
enacted
and
amended
this
basic
labor
statute,
and
therefore,
since
it
is
crucial
of
the
balance
of
power,
it
cannot
be
subject
to
state
preclusion
or
prohibition.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
i
think
it
depends
on
the
area
of
peaceful
economic
weaponry.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
no
sir.
the
federal
labor
policy
in
this
area
is
free
play
of
economic
force.
that
is
a
regulation.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
certainly
not
the
state
government,
justice
white,
certainly
not
the
state
government
and
certainly
not
for
no
interest
other
than
to
second
guess
the
federal
balance.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
the
next
argument
is
yes,
it
is
actually
protected.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
that
is
correct.
arguably
protected
--
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
your
honor,
arguably
protected
in
our
view
is
simply
shorthand
for
the
broader
category
and
the
broader
theory
we
are
referring
to
which
is
self-help
weaponry,
what
congress
intended
to
permit
no
state
can
set
aside.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
as
in
morton
justice
stewart,
as
in
insurance
agents
at
least
for
the
clear
implications
from
it,
and
as
in
florida
power
and
light.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
your
honor,
what
i
am
trying
to
get
across
with
the
respect
of
the
first
point
is
that
because
the
labor
board
has
found
to
be
actually
protected
--
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
you
still
have
to
face
whether
or
not
briggs-stratton,
the
rule
on
briggs-stratton
is
sufficient
to
cover
the
kind
of
conduct
here
to
be
prohibited
by
state
regulation
and
the
entire
thrust
of
my
first
argument
is
presented
here
was
to
try
to
dispel
the
notion
that
on
the
facts
this
can
be
compared
at
all.
i
believe
i
reserve
some
more
time
to
mr.
come.
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
be
very
brief.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
court
and
this
is
in
response
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white.
the
petitioner’s
appendix
page
a-32,
paragraph
12,
we
will
find
a
finding
by
the
commission’s
examiner
affirmed
by
the
commission
with
respect
to
the
non-required
optional
nature
of
the
overtime.
the
answer
to
justice
stewart
--
mr.
gerry
m.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
in
answer
to
justice
stewart’s
question
about
focusing
is
our
legislative
focus
on
partial
strike
activity,
the
answer
of
course
is
first
of
all
that
mr.
come
gave
you
and
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
the
broader
test
must
be
used
with
respect
to
the
morton
analysis
because
where
are
you
going
to
find
the
legislative
focus
in
so
many
words
and
quite
the
same
way
you
found
on

secondary
boycott
pressures
with
respect
to
employer
weaponry,
the
lock
out,
the
unilaterally
change,
the
right
to
replace.
third,
and
this
is
my
basic
answer
to
mr.
mallatt,
the
insurance
agents
rationale
disposes
of
every
argument
mr.
mallatt
made
here
because
they
were
made
by
the
counsel
for
the
nlrb
in
support
of
its
decision
finding
it
to
violate
federal
law.
every
point
he
made
was
argued
by
the
board
and
insurance
agents
and
rejected
in
an
opinion
by
justice
brennan
by
this
court
for
considerations
that
must
oust
state
power
as
well
as
federal
agency
regulation
of
that
conduct.
