mr.
james
c.
mallatt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
we
are
walking
into
the
new
no
law,
no
man’s
area.
the
state
of
wisconsin
afforded
a
remedy
against
coercive,
harassing
tactics
in
a
plant.
i
am
not
going
to
waste
this
court’s
time
with
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
the
overtime
here
was
voluntary
or
required.
we
take
the
position
that
the
record
would
support
the
argument
that
it
was
required,
but
i
mention
this
point
to
demonstrate
the
absolute
necessity
for
hearings
in
these
types
of
cases.
we
urge
this
court
strongly
to
adopt
the
views
of
justice
white
in
lockridge,
ariadne
and
nash-finch.
we
ask
this
court
to
use
this
case
and
there
must
be
a
reason
we
are
here.
we
ask
this
court
to
use
this
case
to
limit
garmon
to
preemption
only
where
activity
is
actually
protected.
prohibited
activity
there
is
a
forum,
the
national
labor
relations
board.
arguably
protected
activity,
there
is
no
law.
it
is
a
no
man’s
area
and
we
are
going
to
do
the
same
thing
we
did
in
guss
versus
utah
labor
board
which
congress
for
once
acted
quickly
and
change
and
filled
the
no
law,
no
man’s
area.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
insurance
agents
in
my
judgment
has
no
play
in
this
case
because
what
this
court
held
in
insurance
agents
was
that
this
type
activity
is
not
sufficient
evidence
for
the
board
to
find
the
8
(b)
(3)
bad
faith
bargaining.
now,
insurance
agents
held
different
that
employer’s
would
have
a
forum
to
at
least
get
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
this
conduct
is
lawful.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
understand
that.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
--
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
our
position
is
briggs-stratton
clearly
covers
this.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
yes,
that
is
clearly
their
argument.
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
disagree
firmly.
this
court
looked
at
the
legislative
history
in
this
area
and
much
detail
in
briggs-stratton
and
i
do
not
--
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
understand
it.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
wanted
to
make
that
point
right
away
because
i
believe
by
my
reading
of
the
cases
that
it
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
are
here
today
is
this
court
is
extremely
concerned
with
uniformity
in
the
labor
law,
but
it
is
also
very
concerned
about
affording
the
people
of
the
united
states,
including
employers
a
right
to
some
sort
of
forum
if
they
have
what
we
feel
is
a
legitimate
grievance.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
absolute
possibility.
there
is
no
question
about
that
your
honor,
no
question
about
that.
i
would
hope
to
try
to
persuade
you
otherwise.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
if
i
may
some
practical
problems
an
employer
faces
when
he
is
faced
with
concerted
activity
in
the
plant.
it
is
too
risky
for
him
to
discharge
his
employees.
it
is
too
risky
for
him
to
discharge
the
union
stewards
and
it
is
not
a
practical
remedy.
just
last
week
we
had
concerted
activity,
partial
strike
activity
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
at
the
panama
canal
the
ships
were
backing
up,
would
it
have
been
an
effective
remedy
of
any
kind
to
fire
the
ship
pilots?
it
could
have
gotten
those
ships
through
the
canal.
so
the
self-help
remedy
is
not
practical.
it
puts
the
employees
in
the
middle.
it
puts
them
right
in
the
middle
between
the
union
which
is
telling
them,
on
threat
of
fine
do
not
work
overtime
and
the
employer
on
the
other
hand
is
telling
them,
you
better
work
overtime
or
we
are
going
to
discharge
you.
who
is
in
the
middle?
the
employee
is
in
the
middle.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
several
reasons.
in
an
all
out
strike,
employee
risks
replacement,
apparent
replacement.
now,
this
is
very
significant
because
--
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
as
i
read
the
law,
the
employer
has
the
right
to
discharge
the
employees
because
this
is
unprotected
activity.
i
say
that
remedy
is
not
practical,
is
not
effective,
and
it
will
create
industrial
warfare.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
my
understanding.
on
the
other
hand,
other
employees
may
well
have
the
right
to
may
have
right
to
strike
in
protest
to
the
discharge.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
believe
that
the
overtime
in
this
case
was
not
wholly
optional.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
right.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
say
if
it
is
concerted
and
i
also
say
your
honor
--
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
would
say
yes
under
john
swift
case,
the
board
case.
i
view
that
case
as
the
employees
have
the
right
to
voluntarily
individually
refuse,
but
not
concertedly.
now,
there
are
other
problems,
practical
problems
the
employer
faces.
it
is
suggested
that
a
lockout
is
a
proper
remedy
or
defense
to
this
type
of
activity?
we
take
the
position
that
an
employer
should
not
be
forced
to
close
his
plant
to
protect
himself
against
activity
in
the
plant,
but
we
also
take
the
position
that
this
raise
is
a
very
serious
problem
in
a
legibly
questionable
area
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
permanently
replace
locked
out
employees.
we
think
that
when
a
employer
is
faced
with
another
legally
unfair
area,
in
our
judgment,
under
united
states
pipe
and
foundry,
the
board
and
the
dc
circuit
said
an
employer
may
not
reduce
or
withhold
benefits
once
the
contract
expired
in
order
to
pressure
his
employees
to
reach
agreement
with
his
bargaining
position.
an
employer
may
not
do
that,
at
least
that
is
what
the
board
says
and
that
is
what
the
dc
circuit
says.
your
honor,
on
the
other
hand,
i
guess
today,
we
are
considering
and
according
to
the
petitioners
the
union
may
use
partial
strike
in
plant,
strike
tactics
to
pressure
the
employer.
all
we
say
is
if
we
put
pressure
on
the
employees,
the
union
has
a
remedy.
they
can
file
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
united
states
government,
the
national
labor
regulations
board,
but
if
we
preempt
this
area,
the
employer
is
going
to
be
left
without
any
legal
remedies.
he
still
has
self-help
and
what
have
you.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
this.
i
realize
the
problems
involved
with
local
states
in
courts
whatever
it
is,
deciding
the
question
of
actually
protected.
i
concede
there
is
a
--
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
true.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
the
wisconsin
court
took
the
view
that
it
was
not
protected
activity
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
they
did
not
make
that
finding.
the
problem
was
--
your
honor,
when
the
case
was
first
tried,
which
is
why
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
commission
--
the
union
took
the
position
that
it
was
preempted
on
the
grounds
that
the
activity
was
prohibited.
so
the
hearing
was
conducted
on
that
basis.
the
voluntary
argument
was
not
raised
until
the
state
supreme
court.
and
i
say
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
there
should
be
some
hearings
in
these
type
of
cases
because
if
it
is
going
to
be
turn
on
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary.
that
cries
our
for
a
need
of
some
sort
of
a
hearing
is
our
position.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
well,
you
just
made
it
for
me.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
correct.
here
you
have
350+
who
refused
to
work
overtime
for
four
months
except
three
who
worked
on
one
saturday.
this
was
a
little
bit
different
ballpark
than
dow
chemical
where
you
have
just
a
few
employees
who
refused
to
work
one
weekend
of
voluntary
overtime
which
had
not
even
been
posted
on
the
posting
board
before
they
made
their
decision
not
to
work.
there
was
no
union
direction
or
ban
or
order
there.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
no
way,
one
or
two,
he
may.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
well
it
is
a
legal
argument
your
honor
because
they
raised
the
question,
the
defense,
that
this
is
in
fact
protected
in
their
view
because
the
employee
may
voluntary
refuse
anyway.
my
argument
is
a
response
to
that.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
it
is
not
practical
in
milwaukee
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
that
the
parties
engaged
in
warfare
i
think
congress
intended
that
there
ought
to
be
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
certain
activity
of
this
nature
is
not
lawful.
if
it
is
lawful,
i
am
out
of
court.
there
is
no
question.
if
this
activity
is
permitted,
i
am
out
of
court.
what
we
are
asking
for
is
a
way
to
make
that,
find
that
out,
because
you
see
what
happen
here
is
typical.
we
file
a
charge;
the
regional
director
dismisses
relying
on
insurance
agents;
sort
of
implies
that
we
go
see
the
state
about
it.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
because
very
candidly
if
we
did
that
your
honor,
we
would
be
putting
yourself
right
out
of
business.
to
discharge
350
employees
and
fire
them
would
have
create
the
kind
of
industrial
strife
in
west
allis,
wisconsin
like
you
have
never
seen
before,
we
would
just
have
to
shut
it
down.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
would
like
to
make
this
point,
if
i
may.
when
a
company
and
a
union
--
and
i
have
been
negotiating
labor
contracts
for
20
years
representing
employers.
when
a
company
and
union
reach
an
agreement
at
the
bargaining
table,
any
professional
in
the
union
business
will
tell
you
that
if
they
can
go
to
the
membership
and
say
this
is
the
company’s
last
offer,
you
accept
it,
it
is
fair
or
you
must
strike
and
lose
wages
and
possibly
be
replaced,
then
the
employee
will
accept
it,
if
it
is
fair.
but
if
we
have
a
middle
ground
where
they
do
not
have
to
accept,
they
do
not
have
to
strike,
but
they
can
do
these
things
in
the
plant.
then
i
say
as
i
practical
matter,
we
are
opening
up
a
vast
area
that
is
going
to
fill
us
with
all
kinds
of
legal
problems.
we
would
hope
--
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
you
are
asking
me
questions
that
i
really
have
not
been
decided
because
you
see
all
these
unprotected
cases
come
up
as
an
employer
is
defending
himself
against
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
then
in
those
instances
the
board
says,
decided
whether
the
activity
was
protected
or
unprotected
and
it
becomes
a
very
close
factual
decision.
but
the
employer
is
always
defending
himself.
so
it
may
turn
out
on
a
lot
of
different
factual,
but
generally
speaking
the
labor
board
takes
the
position
that
a
concerted
refusal
to
work
overtime
is
not
protected.
now
if
i
have
350
employees
involved
in
it,
i
have
a
problem.
do
i
fire
them
all?
am
i
discriminating
in
between?
do
i
fire
just
the
stewards?
i
have
a
very
serious
problem
and
i
just,
as
a
practical
matter,
would
not
even
know
how
to
answer
it.
i
supposed
the
safest
way
legally
is
to
fire
them
all.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
pardon.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
right.
it
would
take
some
very,
very
risky
decisions
and
we
say
that
is
not
an
effective
remedy.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
well
i
would
face
the
problem
because
i
know
of
charge
would
be
issued
in
the
–-
i
would
guess
that
an
examiner,
an
administrative
law
judge
would
say
i
discriminate
it,
but
even
if
he
did
not,
i
would
probably
have
a
strike
on
my
hands
because
the
others
that
i
did
not
fire
would
walk
out
and
protest.
so
these
are
serious
problems,
very
serious
problems
for
employers.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
believe
the
board
would
take
the
position
that
i
was
violating
section
8
of
the
act.
i
believe
the
board
would
take
that
position
in
u.s.
pipe.
in
u.s.
pipe,
the
employer
did
not
engage
in
any
kind
of
firing.
he
said,
“if
you
guys
are
not
going
to
accept
my
offer
and
you
are
going
to
keep
working,
then
you
are
not
going
to
get
paid
holiday
pay.
you
are
not
going
to
get
paid
holiday
pay
and
i
am
not
going
to
pay
vacations.”
now
that
is
a
rather
mild
approach.
but
what
happens.
the
d.c.
circuit
tells
us
we
have
violated
section
885,
we
are
bargaining
in
bad
faith.
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
hear
--
and
maybe
it
is
insurance
agents
that
caused
all
the
mischief
here.
we
hear
that
harassing
tactics
may
be
put
on
us
and
we
have
no
remedy
except
self-help.
this
is
bothersome.
it
is
bothersome
out
there
at
the
level
where
we
have
to
negotiate
labor
contracts.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
absolutely.
it
is
the
worst
thing
we
can
do
if
the
purpose
of
the
act,
the
central
purpose
of
the
act,
is
to
avoid
industrial
strife.
i
cannot
think
of
anything
that
creates
more
strife
than
firing
members
of
a
trade
union,
a
political
organization.
they
must
do
everything
they
can
to
get
those
employees
their
jobs
back.
and
there
is
nothing
that
is
more
destructive
of
good
faith
collective
bargaining
than
for
an
employer
to
start
firing
the
members.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
well,
the
union
has
two
choices:
it
can
accept
the
company’s
last
proposal
or
it
can
strike,
or
it
can
continue
to
negotiate
with
the
company
and
not
make
unilateral
changes
in
the
plant.
you
see,
the
employer
cannot
do
that,
why
should
the
union
be
able
to
do
it?
the
employer
cannot
pressure
his
employees
if
they
are
working
after
a
contract
has
expired.
he
may
lock
them
out.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
we
never
put
it
in.
well
that
was
a
little
pressure,
but
it
did
not
work.[laughter]
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
briggs-stratton
has
served
this
country
well
since
1949.
there
was
very
little
partial
strike
activity
in
the
industrial
scene
in
the
industrial
area.
contrast
that
to
the
public
area
where
in
most
cases,
it
is
unlawful
for
municipal
employees
to
strike.
you
find
a
very
common
problem
of
partial
strikes.
sickens
blue
flu,
these
things
are
common
in
the
industrial
area.
and
we
submit
because
of
the
holding
of
this
court,
the
partial
strike
activity
is
not
legally
sanctioned
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
have
had
very
little
of
this
type
of
activity.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
i
am
urging
this
court
to
sustain
briggs-stratton
which
i
believe
has
the
effect
of
ruling
that
the
--
it
has
the
effect
of
ruling
that
these
states
may
regulate
partial
strike
activities.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
absolutely
correct.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
balance
the
problem
of
lack
of
uniformity
against
the
problem
created
of
no
effective
avenue
to
get
this
kind
of
issue
litigated.
mr.
james
c.
mallatt
that
is
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
colorado
and
hawaii
copied
the
wisconsin
law
which
has
been
law
since
1939,
and
i
believe
that
this
is
the
only
second
or
third
time
that
statute
has
ever
been
used.
we
feel
that
it
is
appropriate
that
the
state
have
the
right
to
afford
a
hearing
so
that
we
may
get
a
cease
and
desist
against
the
perpetrating
union
which
banned
the
overtime
versus
requiring
us
to
take
action
against
individual
employees.
this
court’s
concern
for
an
available
remedy
was,
i
believe,
one
of
the
reasons
for
its
decision
in
vaca
versus
sipes
activity
which
was
clearly
prohibited
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
also
believe
that
this
court’s
concern
that
some
avenue
of
judicial
remedy
be
available
was
part
of
its
reason
for
its
decision
in
linn
versus
plant
guard
workers
or
the
court
stated
in
a
footnote
that
refusal
to
redress
an
otherwise
actionable
wrong
creates
disrespect
for
the
law
and
encourages
the
victim
to
make
matters
into
his
own
hands.
and
i
think
that
we
would
not
like
to
be
encouraged
as
representatives
for
employers
to
use
the
kind
of
self-help
remedy
which
would
create
the
kind
of
industrial
warfare,
which
the
central
theme
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
to
put
the
parties
together
at
the
bargaining
table
and
say,
you
negotiate
in
good
faith.
we
believe
that
if
there
is
a
third
avenue,
do
not
accept,
do
not
strike
but
play
games
in
the
plant,
we
feel
that
this
will
upset
that
delicate
balance
that
is
evolved
over
the
years
in
many
decisions,
board
and
court
decisions.
we
feel
it
will
tip
the
scales.
i
have
nothing
further.
