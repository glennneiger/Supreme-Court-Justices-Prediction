there
has
been
some
dissatisfaction
expressed
with
it,
has
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
distinction
you
are
making
a
practical
one
or
is
it
a
legal
one?
are
you
saying
as
a
practical
matter,
the
employer
cannot
fire
350
people
where
it
could
fire
one,
is
that
you
are
saying?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
a
practical
one
and
not
a
legal
one.
justice
william
h.

even
if

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
you
can
fire
all
of
them,
i
suppose
you
can
subject
yourself
to
a
charge
you
are
firing
on
a
discriminatory
basis,
just
pick
out
the
union
leaders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
your
hypothesis
though
that
would
mean
that
the
other
49
states
went
along
with
wisconsin
in
making
a
state
unfair
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
still
ought
to
be
a
solution
on
any
national
basis
unless
the
other
49
states
did
rule
wisconsin.
