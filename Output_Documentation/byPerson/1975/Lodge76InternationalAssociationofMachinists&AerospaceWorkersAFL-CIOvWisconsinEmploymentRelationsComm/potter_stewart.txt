as
in
the
morton
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
pointed
out
by
justice
white
in
the
ariadne
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now
based
on
a
very
specific
legislative
history
that
congress
had
considered
this
and
rejected
it,
and
therefore,
clearly
left
this
to
the
area
of
self-help?
justice
potter
stewart
the
insurance
agents
case
involved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
slow
down,
if
that
is
what
it
could
be
called
in
that
case,
amounted
to
a
violation
of
what
8
(b)
(5)
or
--
justice

8
(b)
(3),
a
refusal
to
bargain?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
a
different
question?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
discrete
question,
it
is
simply
a
question?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
include
a
sit-down
strike?
justice
potter
stewart
the
argument
as
i
understand
it,
as
i
understand
justice
whiteâ€™s
question
to
be
indicating
of
your
counsel
on
the
other
side
is
simply
that
whether
or
not
this
is
argued,
this
is
not
arguably
or
actually
protected
in
the
sense
of
the
act
nor
arguably
or
actually
prohibited,
but
it
is
simply
something
that
congress
left
to
self-help
and
for
that
reason
it
cannot
be
touch
by
the
state,
is
that
not
the
argument?
do
you
understand
that
to
be
the
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
discharge
and
replace,
so
far
as
his
legal
rights
go?
