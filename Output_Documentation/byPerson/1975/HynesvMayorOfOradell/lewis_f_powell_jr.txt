justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
gather
the
argument
that
you
gave
us
before
we
put
some
questions
to
you
is
basically
an
over
breath
target,
is
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
may
be
more,
but
it
also
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
major,
may
i
interrupt
you
at
this
point?
how
would
you
construe
the
requirement
of
identification
in
writing,
would
a
postcard
suffice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
answer
suggests
that
one
would
have
to
go
to
the
police
station
and
prove
the
correctness
of
his
identity,
is
that
in
your
thinking?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
suppose
i
lived
in
trenton
and
i
just
sent
a
postcard
into
the
police
saying
that
one
of
these
days
i
am
going
to
be
soliciting
for
this
charity
or
that
charity
or
that
candidate
or
some
other,
what
would
happen
from
then
on?
would
that
be
adequate
to
comply
with
the
statute
or
the
ordinance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
trent
from
saying
“my
name
is
powell,
i
live
in
such
and
such
street”?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
cannot
answer
my
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
i
am
leading
up
to
is
whether
you
think,
i
agree,
that
the
ordinance
has
not
been
put
into
effect
yet
but
a
postcard
would
suffice,
and
i
take
it
you
do?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
now,
would
you
file
out
and
discuss
for
an
appropriate
theory
on
how
you
think
that
sort
of
regulation
would
prevent
crime?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
the
ordinance
does
not
serve
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
enacted?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
that
not
dispose
of
the
case?
