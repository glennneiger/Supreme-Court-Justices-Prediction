mr.
taylor,
this
ordinance,
598a,
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
further
amendment,
it
is
subsection
of
ordinance
573
or
is
an
exception
to
the
basic
green
river
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice

stewart
different
section,
it
is
not
an
absolute
prohibition?
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
ordinance,
the
basic
ordinance
573,
requires
what?
justice
potter
stewart
they
probably
are
going
to
be
flushing
violence,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
taylor,
the
basic
ordinance
to
which
this
is
an
exception
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
number
573
is,
of
course
described
in
more
detail
--
justice
potter
stewart
among
other
things,
it
has
a
9
a.m.
to
5
p.m.
restriction,
but
it
is
my
understanding,
you
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken
in
that
understanding,
that
none
of
the
provisions
of
573
carry
over
it
into
this
ordinance.
this
ordinance
stands
and
falls
on
its
own?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
that
was
remedy?
justice
potter
stewart
so
none
of
the
substantive
provision
carry
over
into
the
ordinance
now
before
us?
