there
is
nothing
in
the
ordinance
that
requires
anybody
to
go
to
the
police
station
as
i
read
it,
you
can
make
a
telephone
call,
can
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
ordinance
not
require
you
to
register
while
a
campaign
is
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
do
you
have
to
register?
when
do
you
have
to
identify
yourself?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
do
you
think
that
you
have
to
say
what
campaign
you
are
interested
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
just
send
in
a
name
and
just
say
“someday
i
am
going
to
either
solicit
for
a
charity
or
solicit
for
a
candidate
for
office.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
is
it
required?
is
it
required
to
identify
the
campaign
that
you
are
interested
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
have
to
say
what
side
you
are
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
do
have
to
say
what
campaign
you
are
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
have
to
tell
the
police
for
whom
you
are
going
to
be
soliciting?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
do
not
think
that
is
--
you
do
not
think
that
would
deter
anybody
from
soliciting?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
does
not
apply
just
to
can
candidates,
it
just
applies
to
anybody
who
is
soliciting
on
his
behalf?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suppose
a
state
could
say
to
solicitors
“please
knock
before
you
enter
the
house”?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
that
is
another
criminal
law
like
this
one
is.
it
is
a
condition
on
this
criminal
law,
is
a
condition
on
the
place
of
where
you
are
going
to
solicit.
if
you
want
to
enter
a
private
property,
we
want
to
know
who
you
are
and
if
you
want
to
enter
on
private
property
you
are
supposed
to
have
consent
before
you
enter?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
to
the
door?
