mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
which
upheld
against
federal
constitutional
challenge,
a
municipal
ordinance,
which
requires
that
any
person
who
wishes
to
call
from
house
to
house
in
support
of
a
political
campaign
or
cause
must,
first,
identify
himself
with
the
municipal
police
in
writing.
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
in
the
past
term
of
court.
now,
your
honors,
there
are
one
or
two
twists
in
the
litigation
history
of
the
case
which
are
irrelevant
to
the
posture
in
which
the
case
now
comes
before
the
court
and
which
i
believe
and
hope,
are
adequately
explained
in
the
statement
and
in
our
brief
to
which,
i
believe,
my
brother
at
the
bar
here
has
taken
no
exception.
so,
i
am
going
to
content
myself
with
a
very
brief
summary
which
i
hope
the
court
will
find
sufficient.
the
defendant
appellee
here,
the
borough
of
oradell,
has,
at
least
since
1971,
had
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
a
green
river
ordinance,
affecting
house
to
house
calling
by
commercial
solicitors,
salesman
and
solicitors
for
commercial
purposes
that,
being
the
local
state
of
the
law
in
oradell.
in
march
1973,
the
appellant
hynes
who
was
then
a
member
of
new
jersey
assembly
and
a
candidate
for
re-nomination
and
reelection,
and
to
whose
constituency
the
borough
of
oradell
had
just
been
added
by
a
statewide
reapportionment,
in
march
1973,
hynes
went
to
oradell
and
commenced
a
campaign
from
house
to
house.
the
police
had
accosted
him
and
made
him
stop
canvassing
and
asked
him
to
leave
the
borough
although,
of
course,
ordinance
then
in
effect
did
not
cover
this
situation
at
all.
a
very
few
weeks
after
that,
the
borough
of
oradell
enacted
the
ordinance
extending
its
coverage
to
solicitors
for
charitable
contributions
and
any
person
campaigning
for
a
political
--
canvassing
for
a
political
campaign
or
cause.
pardon?
mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
haynes
is
a
democrat,
your
honor.
mr.
telford
taylor
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it
is
not.
yes,
i
suppose
so,
since
--
mr.
telford
taylor
right,
the
ordinance
having
been
enacted,
the
appellant
hynes
and
four
other
plaintiffs,
likewise
appellants
here
who
were
residents
of
oradell,
hynes
himself
was
not
though
oradell
was
part
of
the
constituency,
four
residents
brought
a
suit
for
declaratory
and
an
injunctive
relief
focusing
their
complaint
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
they
prevailed
in
the
lower
courts
on
a
combination
of
state
and
federal
grounds,
but
between
the
time
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
time
when
the
case
reached
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
a
further
amendment
to
the
ordinance
eliminated
the
state
questions
and
so
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
reviewed
the
case
squarely
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitution
and
upheld
the
ordinance
by
a
vote
of
5
to
2.
parenthetically,
i
should
note
that
on
the
same
day,
the
day
they
decided
this
case,
they
rendered
their
decision
in
the
collingswood
case
which
involved
a
wholly
different
kind
of
solicitation
ordinance
from
another
borough
and
there
is
some
cross
reference
between
the
opinions
in
the
two
cases.
therefore,
we
have
included
the
opinion
in
the
collingswood
case
in
our
appendix.
that
case
is
pending
here
on
appeal
and
i
believe
the
court
has
taken
no
action
on
it.
now,
the
ordinance
in
the
form
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
reviewed
it
is
in
our
brief
on
pages
3
and
4
to
which
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
for
just
a
moment.
i
think
the
court
will
see
on
page
3
where
the
“whereas”
clauses
explain
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance
that
are
set
out;
that
the
explicit
and
exclusive
purpose
of
the
statute
is
public
safety
against
crime,
the
theory
being
that
people
on
a
pretext
of
soliciting
votes
will
then
engage
in
breaking
and
entering
or
larceny.
on
the
operative
clause
of
the
ordinance
on
page
4,
the
court
will
see
that
it
covers
any
person
who
is
canvassing
for
charitable
cause
or
for
any
federal
state
county
or
municipal
political
campaign
or
cause,
that
such
a
person
must
notify
the
police
department
in
writing
for
identification
and
that
one
notification
is
sufficient
for
the
duration
of
the
campaign
or
cause.
the
penalty
clause
--
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon
me?
mr.
telford
taylor
i
would
have
to
observe
there
is
a
slight
sexist
phraseology
in
the
ordinance,
your
honor,
yes.
the
attitude
apparently
is
that
only
men
work
and
the
women
are
home.
on
that
point,
i
will
have
a
little
more
to
say
later,
but
i
think
it
does
not
affect
the
apparent
purpose
of
the
ordinance
as
directed
in
terms
of
public
safety
against
crime.
there
is
a
penalty
in
the
underlying
green
river
ordinance
applicable
here
which
a
fine
of
$500
or
90
days
in
jail,
cumulative
day
by
day.
the
new
jersey
court,
the
majority,
up
--
mr.
telford
taylor
an
amendment.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
it
is
phrased
as
an
exception
which
is
a
little
curious
because
it
was
excepting
things
that
were
not
in
there
before.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
was
at
one
and
the
same
time
an
extension
to
other
people,
but
with
a
different
requirement
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
same
section,
but
different
requirements
to
validate
the
soliciting.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
covers
commercial
solicitation
and
it
specifies
in
considerable
detail
what
the
notice
filed
with
the
police
shall
be
and
of
course
then
there
has
to
be
a
license
for
that
which
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
think
that
is
true
if
you
are
commercially
soliciting,
but
it
is
not
true
with
respect
to
the
cognizance
of
question
here
now.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
would
have
to
check
it
in
the
appendix,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
telford
taylor
right,
the
ordinance
of
course
is
set
forth
there.
now,
we
of
course
recognize
that
public
safety
is
legitimate
and
indeed
a
very
vital
public
interest
and
we
are
not
contending
here
that
calling
house
to
house
is
totally
immune
from
legislative
restriction.
i
am
not
standing
here
and
supporting
any
such
absolute,
but
our
position
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
did
very
badly
misjudge
the
constitutional
practical
factors
that
are
at
work
here
in
these
contending
values
and
that
we
think
a
proper
judgment
on
them
would
require
a
contrary
conclusion.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes?
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
indeed.
that
question,
of
course,
was
put
to
counsel
by
the
new
jersey
court
and
the
court
seems
to
have
taken
the
position
that
there
was
no
less,
i
think.
we
have
touched
on
that
in
the
brief.
a
limitation
on
the
time
of
day
at
which
you
could
call
from
house
to
house
might
well
be
legitimate,
legislation
in
support
of
householders
who
gave
notice
they
did
not
want
people
using
their
front
side
walk
and
ringing
the
bell.
for
this
purpose,
it
would
be
sufficient.
i
think,
beyond
that,
one
would
have
to
say
it
would
depend
upon
the
kind
of
abuse
that
was
troubling
the
city
council
on
which
we
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
maybe
i
did
not
put
it
clearly.
the
restriction
on
time
of
day
would
put
no
burden
on
the
householder.
well
the
second,
i
suppose,
would
mean
that
the
householder
would
have
to
give
some
indication
that
he
did
not
want
solicitors
coming
to
the
door.
of
course,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
--
whether
going
beyond
that
is
permissible
or
not
must
depend
upon
assessing
how
deep
is
the
infringement
on
first
amendment
here
and
how
great
is
the
municipal
interest
that
requires
a
restriction
and
that
is
what
i
propose
to
address
myself
to
now.
with
respect
to
the
depth
of
the
infringement
here,
both
in
terms
of
the
scope
and
the
depth,
i
would
like
to
make
some
observations.
the
case
here
has
proceeded
continually
on
the
basis
that
the
main
effect
of
this
is
the
restriction
on
a
candidate
that
a
candidate
must
register.
the
affidavit
of
the
chief
of
police
of
oradell
attached
to
the
answer
here
is
exclusively
concerned
with
the
obligation
of
the
candidate,
but
of
course,
the
restriction
here
is
not
limited
to
candidates.
it
applies
to
any
person
and
that
means
all
canvassers,
anyone
who
is
going
to
get
signatures
on
behalf
of
a
candidate
is
affected
by
this.
the
court
below
saw
this
as
a
way
of
protecting
the
community
against
strangers
infiltrating
into
the
community,
but
the
ordinance
is
not
so
limited.
it
covers
residents
of
the
community
as
well
as
people
coming
in
from
the
outside.
the
talk
has
all
been
about
campaigns,
but
it
is
not
restricted
to
campaigns.
it
covers
political
causes.
now,
the
combination
of
all
these
would
mean,
i
submit,
that
if
a
householder
in
oradell
wishes
to
canvas
his
own
block,
wishes
to
call
from
house
to
house
in
his
own
block,
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
to
the
equal
rights
amendment,
to
school
busing,
to
charter
reform,
that
he
must
first
register
with
the
police
--
he
or
she
must
first
register
with
the
police.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
should
think
so.
things
have
a
way
of
becoming
political
issues
that
perhaps
should
not,
but
all
those
sorts
of
things
are
political
in
the
sense
that
the
political
authorities
will
pass
on
them,
and
therefore,
it
would
be,
it
seems
to
us,
a
very
chilling
effect,
on
that
sort
of
community,
political
consultation.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
that
is
an
extremely
relevant
question
to
the
other
side
of
the
coin
here,
that
is
the
extent
of
the
necessity
for
this
kind
of
restriction
and
i
will
address
myself
to
that
directly
now.
the
record
here
is,
i
think,
wholly
insufficient
to
establish
any
such
thing.
the
only
evidence
touching
on
this
point
is
contained
in
chief
broniolli’s
affidavit
in
support
of
the
answer
in
which
it
is
the
last
thing
in
the
appendix.
if
your
honors
wish
to
look
at
it,
it
is
on
page
g4
of
the
appendix,
and
the
part
of
it
that
speaks
to
your
question,
contains
some
statistics
on
the
number
of
breakings
and
enterings
within
the
borough
in
1969,’70,’71,
’72,
and
so
forth,
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
his
affidavit
or
anywhere
else
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
a
single
one
of
those
breakings
and
entering
had
anything
to
do
with
door
to
door
solicitation.
there
is
a
total
lack
of
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
is
very
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
it
is
the
tail
end
of
the
appendix.
mr.
telford
taylor
g4.
mr.
telford
taylor
g4
and
g4-5,
yes.
the
statistics
on
breaking
and
entering
in
oradell,
we
have
compared
in
our
brief
with
the
statistics
nationwide.
the
rate
is
very
considerably
lower
than
the
nationwide
rate.
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief,
we
have
compared
oradell
with
the
new
jersey
crime
statistics
and
other
boroughs
of
comparable
size.
there
is
no
indication
that
there
are,
in
any
sense,
any
particular
conditions
in
oradell.
there
are
several
boroughs
with
much
higher
rates,
several
at
slightly
lower
rates.
it
seems
to
be
wholly
characteristic.
so,
there
is
neither
any
showing
of
a
pervasive
nationwide
need,
no
showing
of
local
peculiarity,
and
absolutely
no
showing
that
a
single
one
of
the
breakings
and
enterings
was
the
result
of
somebody
posing
as
a
canvasser,
and
as
your
honor
says,
getting
a
foot
in
the
door.
there
is
nothing
there.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
think
it
is
an
appropriate
consideration,
but
it
seems
to
me
that,
here,
where
one
would
expect
if
that
was
so,
your
honor,
that
some
other
places
where
this
had
broken
out
would
have
felt
a
need
for
this
kind
of
ordinance.
we
have
done
our
best
to
find
if
there
are
any
other
places
which
have
felt
this
necessity
and
although
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
canvass
all
the
municipal
legislation
of
the
united
states,
we
have
done
our
best
and
have
not
come
across
any
indication
that
any
other
place
had
done
this.
then,
of
course,
there
is
a
particular
history
here
that
this
ordinance
came
on
the
heels
of
a
particular
episode.
i
have
a
couple
more
things
to
say
later
about
the
rationality
of
the
ordinance
in
terms
of
its
purpose,
but
i
think
not
and
i
think
that,
again
that
this,
since
we
are
in
the
first
amendment
area
here,
that
this
speculation
that
it
might
have
happened
somewhere
else
is
quite
insufficient
to
justify
the
depth
of
the
infringement
on
the
first
amendment
here.
the
lower
court
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
do
not
mean
the
lower
court,
the
new
jersey
--
pardon
me?
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
it
is
more
than
that.
we
have
a
vagueness
argument
which
i
have
not
touched
on
yet.
yes,
it
is
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
there
is
none
of
that,
that
is
true.
i
have
not
come
to
the
respects
in
which
this
seems
to
me
so
deep
an
infringement,
the
new
jersey
court
seems
to
have
thought
that
just
registering
with
the
police
is
really
no
trouble
to
anybody
and
why
should
anybody
be
excited
about
it,
but
if
one
thinks
about
this
in
terms
of
the
political
process
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
confronted
in
recent
years
on
requirements
that
minority
parties,
parties
that
have
not
been
major
parties
before
get
signatures
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot,
other
parts
of
the
political
process
of
this
court
has
upheld.
i
believe
in
one
of
them
justice
white
emphasized
the
vital
role
that
dedicated
volunteers
must
play
in
an
effective
political
process.
if
one
thinks
in
those
terms,
the
difficulties
of
recruiting
volunteers
to
get
signatures,
to
urge
people
to
go
to
the
polls
and
so
forth,
if
they
must
first
go
to
the
police
station
or
mail
in
their
notification
is
very
considerable.
the
mailing
then
may
not
suit
--
pardon?
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
in
many
instances,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
yes
and
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
such
people
are
very
much
different
from
anybody
else.
if
we
are
a
political
campaign
--
mr.
telford
taylor
they
may
well
not
be
people
who
look
happily
on
a
visit
to
the
police
station.
mr.
telford
taylor
most
people
do
not
go
to
the
police
station
for
pleasant
reasons.
they
go
either
because
their
car
has
been
stolen
or
they
have
stolen
somebody
else’s
car,
and
the
whole
business
here
you
cannot
schedule
canvassing.
as
a
matter
of
getting
volunteers
by
hook
or
by
crook
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
has
to
be
in
writing.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
has
to
be
in
writing
specifically
under
the
ordinance,
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
you
would
have
to
get
your
writing
there
either
by
mail
or
by
personal
delivery.
you
could
send
it
by
somebody
else,
but
if
one
canvasser
has
a
sick
daughter
or
something
and
cannot
go
and
you
want
to
send
somebody
else,
there
will
not
be
time
to
do
that
other
than
by
going
down.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
would
not
do
it
fast
enough.
it
is
a
matter
of
getting
somebody
else
on
the
spot
notice.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
think
that
in
this
area,
there
are
certain
matters
or
commonalities
that
the
court
can
recognize.
i
do
not
believe
there
has
ever
been
a
campaign
where,
at
the
outset
of
it,
one
had
a
complete
list
of
all
people
who
might
be
going
to
canvass.
one
of
the
big
things
about
a
campaign
is
persuading
people
to
come
and
do
it
and
if
when
you
try
to
persuade
them
to
come,
you
have
got
to
stay
in
the
same
breath,
well
i
am
sorry,
but
before
you
can
do
any
of
this
you
have
got
to
get
word
to
the
police
and
identify
yourself.
we
are
overlooking
entirely
up
to
this
point,
your
honors,
the
whole
question
of
ethnics,
political
view
points,
the
candidate
particularly
for
local
offices,
maybe
a
person
the
police
department
do
not
like
very
much
or
they
do
not
like
what
he
is
standing
for,
suppose
it
is
for
civilian
review
board
who
review
police
brutality.
there
are
all
kinds
of
things.
it
may
make
people
very
reluctant
to
do
this.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
the
only
record
we
have
of
the
necessity
is
that
update
and
i
submit
it
is
totally
insufficient
to
warrant
a
restriction
which
i
think
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
one
can
see
will
be
a
considerable
chill
here,
justice
rehnquist.
i
do
not
see
how
one
can
doubt
that
the
whole
matter
of
recruiting
people
to
do
this
very
necessary
and
arduous
task
would
be
rendered
enormously
more
difficult
by
this
kind
of
requirement.
there
is
further
factor
of
anonymity
of
course,
the
problem
that
talley
against
california
covers.
it
may
generally
be
that
candidates
do
not
act
anonymously,
but
for
canvassers
and
others
the
situation
is
quite
different.
they
may
be
quite
willing
to
identify
themselves
to
the
household
that
they
go
to
see,
but
not
nearly
as
keen
about
identifying
themselves
to
the
police
if
their
cause
is
one
that
is
likely
to
be
unpopular
to
the
police.
police
have
ethnic
and
class
prejudices
like
other
people
do.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me
a
reasonably
safe
assumption
and
in
the
second
place,
i
think
you
must
also
examine
the
record.
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon?
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
over
or
under
50,
i
think
they
will
still
reflect
the
same
prejudice
as
an
attitude
that,
seem
to
me,
troublesome
here.
now
--
mr.
telford
taylor
some,
whether
enough
is
another
matter,
but
in
fact,
it
is
the
police
here
not
the
town
clerk.
mr.
telford
taylor
probably,
the
chilling
effect
would
be
somewhat
less,
but
since
the
purpose
here
is
public
safety,
the
whole
purpose
of
this
statute
will
be
frustrated,
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
made
it
the
town
clerk.
the
whole
purpose
here
is
to
get
in
the
hands
of
the
police
right
away.
so,
that
is
really
not
our
situation.
the
point
on
vagueness,
which
i
will
just
take
a
minute
on
if
i
may;
once
again
the
new
jersey
court
seems
to
have
thought
that
the
ordinance
was
crystal
clear
and
it
certainly
is
clear
enough
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
speech
that
it
covers,
that
is,
the
charitable
solicitation,
the
political
counseling,
and
so
forth,
but
i
submit
that
the
notifying
in
writing
for
identification
only
is
quite
insufficient.
what
can
the
police
legitimately
require
for
identification
purposes?
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
they
have
put
out
no
rules.
they
have
put
out
no
forms.
the
police
chief
has
made
a
couple
of
remarks
about
it
in
his
affidavit,
but
of
course,
they
do
not
seem
to
be
in
any
way
binding
on
him
or
his
successor.
if
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance
is
to
help
the
police
to
know
where
canvassing
is
going
on,
it
would
seem
to
require
some
indication
of
where
in
the
borough
you
are
going
to
be
or
this
does
not
say
one
way
or
the
other.
are
these
lists
to
be
kept
confidential
or
made
public
or
this
does
not
help
us?
it
seems
to
me,
they
are
just
too
many
questions
left
unanswered
here
and
i
refer
the
court
to
justice
pachman’s
dissent
below
where
he
stresses,
it
seems
to
me
very
effectively,
the
special
risks
of
harassment,
discriminatory
enforcement
and
so
forth,
that
in
here
in
the
vague
quality
of
this
restriction.
now
in
conclusion,
may
i
say,
that
with
the
very
--
with
the
total
lack
of
any
indication
need
here
with
the
obvious
effect
that
it
is
going
to
have
on
a
political
process
on
neighborhood
discussion
that
the
whole
balance
here
was
misjudged
below
and
that
the
case
calls
for
reversal.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
telford
taylor
if
the
question,
your
honor,
is
whether
it
can
be
done
by
a
postcard,
that
is
to
say
by
mail,
that
is
one
matter
to
which
the
new
jersey
court
did
advert,
but
in
a
somewhat
ambivalent
way.
it
is
on
page
a5
of
the
appendix
and
the
court
said
“the
requirement
may
be
satisfied
in
writing”
suggesting
that
resort
may
be
had
to
the
mails.
i
was
going
to
make
reference
to
that
in
connection
with
justice
powell’s
question.
of
course,
that
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
an
interpretation.
it
is
a
suggestion.
this
might
be
so.
i
believe
that
my
basic
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
on
most
of
these
matters
the
ordinance
is
impossibly
vague.
it
does
not
tell
us.
i
think
it
does
tell
us
the
answer
to
justice
white’s
question
about
campaigns
because
there
is
this
sentence
that
the
notification
shall
be
good
for
the
duration
of
a
campaign
or
cause
and
it
is
hard
to
see
how
that
can
be
implemented
unless
the
campaign
or
cause
is
specified.
whether
you
have
to
say
which
side
of
the
campaign,
your
honor,
is
a
further
question
which,
again,
i
think
the
ordinance
gives
us
no
answer.
might
i
just
say,
again,
in
response
to
justice
powell’s
colloquy
with
my
brother
at
the
bar
here,
i
think,
he
remarked
that
the
ordinance
is
not
yet
in
effect.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
so.
the
relief
granted
by
the
trial
court
was
declaratory
only.
that,
of
course,
was
reversed
in
the
supreme
court
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
ordinance
is
in
effect
what
the
practical
result
has
been
in
terms
of
the
administration
of
it.
the
record
is,
of
course,
silent
on
it.
i
believe
the
ordinance
is
now
in
effect.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
know
in
detail
the
new
jersey
decisions
on
the
scope
of
an
appellate
court’s
interpretative
power
there.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
why
i
say
i
do
not
know
the
scope
of
new
jersey
law
on
the
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
should
hope
so,
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
i
should
think
so.
if
they
do
not,
probably
the
criminal
law
would
--
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
this
court
said
in
bird
against
alexandria
that
failing
some
explicit
withdrawal
of
the
invitation
on
the
part
of
the
householder
that
the
front
pass
or
the
door
knocker
relieve
the
entry
of
the
character
of
trespass.
mr.
telford
taylor
up
to
the
door.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
latter,
certainly.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
restriction
of
that
kind
ought
to
be
okay.
i
think
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that,
with
political
canvassing,
contrary
to
the
impression
one
gets
from
this
ordinance,
it
is
not
very
effectively
done
until
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
or
evening
when
the
working
members
of
the
family
of
which
ever
sex,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
at
home
when
one
would
go
canvassing
until
that
was
so.
so
that
the
emphasis
here
on
the
daylight
hours
and
all
when
the
working
man
or
a
woman
is
away,
it
seems
to
be
wrong
in
this
place.
i
do
not
believe
in
some
summary
that
the
ordinance
exhibits
a
rational
connection
between
the
announced
objective
and
the
terms
it
imposes.
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
certainly
the
impingement
of
first
amendment
values
would
be
much
than
a
9
p.m.
case.
i
have
stressed
that
because
of
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
exhibited
great
solicit
to
for
the
function
of
canvassing
and
their
privacy
too.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
only
the
penalty
provision
that
is
carried
over
by
way
of
--
mr.
telford
taylor
that
was
remedy,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
my
understanding,
that
is
my
understanding.
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
