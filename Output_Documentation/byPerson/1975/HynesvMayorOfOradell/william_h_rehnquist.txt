does
the
commercial
solicitor
have
to
pay
for
his
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
do
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taylor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
kind
of
door
to
door
soliciting
is
not
immune
from
some
regulation.
can
you
conceive
of
a
less
onerous
regulation
than
the
one
that
the
borough
has
imposed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
kind
you
have
mentioned
puts
the
burden
both
on
a
householder
and
the
town
to
enforce
it
in
a
way
that
this
does,
if
the
individual
has
got
to
go
and
make
the
compliant
themselves?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
taylor,
do
you
think
that
people
who
would
be
successful
in
getting
people
to
sign
up
on
a
door
to
door
basis
are
the
kind
of
people
that
will
be
loath
to
register
with
the
police?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
not
have
to
appear
personally
under
the
ordinance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
sending
a
whole
list?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
sending
just
a
whole
list
of
people
that
these
are
substitutes
and
they
will
be
doing
it
too.
is
it
not
one
of
your
problems
here
the
fact
that
you
have
never
really
done
this
and
so
you
do
not
know
what
the
mechanics
or
the
details
of
the
thing
would
be
when
they
are
worked
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
had
a
record
showing
that,
we
could
take
some
account
of
it,
but
this
is
simply
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
without
ever
anybody
going
and
doing
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
asking
us
to
assume
that
without
ever
any
showing
in
the
record
that
that
is
the
case
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
it
not
be
easier
for
you
if
it
were
the
town
clerk?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
think
there
will
be
a
difference
constitutionally
or
could
be
if
it
were
the
town
clerk?
