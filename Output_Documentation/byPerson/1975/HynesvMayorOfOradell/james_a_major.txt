mr.
james
a.
major
--
and
members
of
the
court.
before
i
commence
my
argument,
justice
brennan,
mr.
hynes
in
this
case
is
a
democrat.
i
voted
for
him.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
james
a.
major
yes,
indeed.
we
have
a
democratic
legislature
and
a
democratic
government.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
major
hynes,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
major
an
assemblyman,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
major
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
major
they
have
apportioned
the
districts,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
james
a.
major
when
he
canvassed
me,
justice
brennan,
he
lived
in
maywood
and
i
lived
in
hackensack
and
he
--
mr.
james
a.
major
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
major
very
well,
sir.
it
has
not
done
me
any
harm,
sir.
[laughter]in
this
particular
case,
the
problem
that
we
have,
and
i
would
like
to
lay
it
right
on
the
table
so
that
you
understand
what
we
are
driving
at.
we
do
have
a
small
community.
we
do
not
have
what
you
would
call
policemen
on
regular
troll
and
what
not,
and
we
have
people
coming
into
the
town.
i
am
going
to
say,
for
instance,
justice
jackson
pointed
this
out
in
one
of
his
dissenting
opinions,
what
happens
and
it
will
lead
up
to
what
i
say
is
the
reason
we
adapt
these
ordinances.
people
will
come
to
town
in
a
colony
and
they
will
descend
on
your
town
and
they
will
debauch
a
group
of
canvassers
and
through
your
town
they
go
knocking
at
doors,
“we
are
soliciting
this,”
“we
are
soliciting
that,”
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
now,
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief
and
i
think
as
justices
will
recognize,
the
man
who
has
in
mind
casing
a
house
for
future
burglary
does
not
announce
that
fact.
he
is
going
on
the
guise
of
a
solicitor
whether
for
a
charitable
campaign
or
whatever
it
is.
now,
ever
since
this
court
laid
down
the
decision
in
the
valentine
case,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
commercial
free
speech,
if
i
can
coin
the
phrase,
is
subject
to
regulation
and,
in
some
cases,
to
prohibition.
now,
we
have
adapted
and
you
will
find
it,
if
you
ask
counsel
about
the
initial
ordinance,
you
will
find
it
at
e1
which
is
our
original
canvassing
ordinance
and
you
will
notice
there
that
the
person
who
applies
for
a
permit
must
fill
out
a
form,
answer
certain
questions,
and
the
like,
describe
the
goods
that
he
is
soliciting,
and
so
forth.
those
ordinances
have
been
upheld
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
i
understand,
are
not
attacked
here.
now,
we
take
a
step
further.
we
have
people
come
to
the
town.
they
say
“we
are
soliciting
votes.”
“we
are
running
for
this,”
“we
are
running
for
that,”
and
“we
want
to
go
from
house
to
house.”
now,
as
carefully
as
i
have
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
i
read
them
in
preparing
this
particular
ordinance,
i
have
found
nowhere
does
it
say
there
is
a
premise
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
ring
my
doorbell.
i
may
forbid
him
and
the
court
probably
is
familiar
with
buildings
where
there
are
signs,
“solicitors
prohibited,”
“soliciting
prohibited,”
and
the
like.
now,
these
people
come
in
and
say
“we
are
soliciting”
or
“running
for
office,”
so
forth
and
so
on.
the
question
then
is,
should
we
have
some
idea
who
they
are?
and,
i
think
when
counsel
says
“there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
this
was
done,
i
think
the
court
would
really
sit
up
in
its
respective
chairs,
if
i
said
that
we
have
12
unsolved
murders
in
our
vicinity,
and
therefore,
there
is
fear
in
the
minds
of
the
householders.
now,
you
may
say
“well,
it
is
an
unjustifiable
fear.”
it
is
one
of
the
incidents
you
have
to
put
up
with
in
living
in
civilized
society,
but
if
a
legislative
body
is
going
to
be
responsive
to
the
will
of
its
people,
it
has
to
recognize
these
conditions,
and
therefore,
the
first
amendment
to
this
ordinance
was
passed.
now,
here
is
where
we
had
trouble.
it
came
before
the
trial
judge
on
the
return
of
an
order
to
show
cause.
there
was
not
a
plenary
hearing.
no
testimony
was
taken,
and
counsel
who
then
appeared
for
mr.
hynes
and
his
fellows,
took
the
position
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
regulation
and
i
emphasize
that
position,
an
unreasonable
regulation
of
the
right
of
free
speech,
and
it
was
on
that
hypothesis
that
the
case
was
argued.
along
came
the
trial
judge,
and
counsel
and
i
are
agreed
on
one
thing,
it
is
very
hard
to
follow
that
opinion.
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
correctly
transcribed
or
what,
but
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
he
said
that
if
you
are
running
for
office,
you
do
not
have
to
comply
with
any
regulations.
you
are
right
to
run
for
office
is
absolute.
now,
i
know
of
no
decision
by
this
court,
going
back
to
justice
black
and
the
other
who
were
absolutists
to
the
effect
to
the
right
of
free
speech
was
not
subject
to
regulation,
which
took
that
position.
so,
we
try
i
might
say,
parenthetically,
the
amended
ordinance
was
defective
because
it
had
no
sanctions
and
an
ordinance
without
sanctions
is
no
ordinance.
so,
we
amended
it
and
amended
it
in
the
light
of
the
challenge
that
was
made.
compare
the
amended
ordinance
with
the
one
which
you
will
find
at
e1
which
requires
answer
to
questions,
identification,
and
so
forth.
the
only
requirement
that
we
put
in
here,
and
we
thought
we
were
compliant
not,
justice
brennan,
the
idea
of
keeping
democrats
out
of
oradell
or
anything
of
the
sort,
but
with
the
idea
of
analyzing
competing
principles.
surely,
a
man
has
a
right
to
run
for
office.
surely,
he
has
a
right
to
solicit
signatures
on
nominating
petitions
and
the
like.
also,
we
ought
to
have
some
idea
of
who
you
are,
and
therefore,
we
only
said
one
thing,
identify
yourself
in
writing
to
the
police
chief.
say
you
are
mr.
hynes
and
you
are
going
to
be
in
oradell
soliciting
house
to
house.
say
you
are
so
and
so
and
you
are
going
to
--
mr.
james
a.
major
i
would
say
that
it
can
be
done
in
writing.
i
would
say
anything
in
a
way
of
a
driver’s
license
or
anything
that
i
am
what
i
pretend
to
be.
mr.
james
a.
major
the
ordinance
says
“in
writing.”
it
does
not
require
a
personal
appearance
at
the
police
station.
now,
the
only
time
i
think
that
the
suggestion
you
have
in
mind
or
the
thought
that
may
be
troubling
you
would
come
into
play
is
if
the
person
were
not
recognized
by
his
writing.
in
other
words
--
mr.
james
a.
major
i
would
definitely
say,
contrary
to
what
is
said
in
the
opponent’s
brief
that
there
will
be
no
discretion
in
the
police
chief
to
say
that
is
not
a
recognized
charity
or
anything
of
the
sort.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
had
in
mind
cantwell
against
connecticut.
mr.
james
a.
major
the
secretary
of
state
was
in
power
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
recognized
charity
and
so
forth.
we
have
not
gone
into
that.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
would
say
that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
james
a.
major
definitely
not.
mr.
james
a.
major
no,
sir.
mr.
james
a.
major
definitely.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
call
to
your
attention,
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
which
you
will
find
on
a11,
i
beg
your
pardon,
that
is
on
the
dissenting
opinion,
but
on
page
87
quoting
from
that
opinion,
“at
oral
argument
the
attorney
for
plaintiff
hynes
candidly
admitted
as
indeed
he
was
obliged
to
by
the
circumstances
that
he
conceive
of
no
less
a
form
of
intrusion
on
the
right
of
free
speech
other
than
absolutely
no
intrusion
than
the
identification
device
here.
now,
contrary
wise,
justice
harshman
on
whom
the
appellant
relies
and
comments
him
on
his
learning,
says
this
“the
oradell
ordinance,”
and
i
am
reading
from
a11,
“the
oradell
ordinance
which,
in
its
amended
form,
merely
requires
a
single
registration
by
each
canvasser
during
each
campaign
solely
for
purposes
of
identification
would
on
its
face
appear
to
impose
no
serious
burden
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.”
then,
having
said
that,
he
goes
on
to
imagine
what
might
happen.
now,
after
all
is
said
and
done,
the
best
we
can
do
is
draft
an
ordinance
which
we
think
has
fit
everybody,
and
of
course
if
you
draw
the
language
to
its
extreme,
i
suppose
you
can
make
it
almost
nonsensical,
but
as
i
say,
that
is
the
purpose
we
had
in
mind,
identification
and
not
only
that
and,
in
the
brief
that
i
filed
here,
i
have
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
last
thing
in
the
world
we
want
to
do
is
deprive
hynes
or
anybody
else
of
the
right
to
come
in
and
solicit
so
long
as
we
know
who
they
are.
now,
justice
pachman,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
referred
to
some
of
the
cases
which
are
before
this
court,
particularly
those
involving
jehovah
witnesses
and
the
like
where
they
were
very
much
in
the
minority.
as
i
have
heard
it
said
many
times,
a
majority
does
not
need
a
constitution
and
a
majority
does
not
need
anything
else,
got
the
votes.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
i
cannot
conceive
that
this
ordinance
or
any
of
its
prototypes
enacted
in
other
places
would
prevent
democrats
or
republicans
or
anybody
else
from
soliciting
votes.
mr.
james
a.
major
does
it
not
require
what,
sir?
mr.
james
a.
major
before
you
start
soliciting
from
house
to
house.
if
you
are
not
soliciting
from
house
to
house,
you
need
not
register
with
anybody.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
do
not
know
if
he
would
do
to
go
that
far.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
would
definitely
say
that
it
might
be
preferable
to
say
--
mr.
james
a.
major
i
would
think
so,
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
james
a.
major
no.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
would
say
that
a
letter
to
the
police
chief
that
“i
am
so
and
so
and
i
will
be
soliciting
house
to
house
in
borough
of
oradell
in
support
of
my
candidacy”
would
be
sufficient.
i
do
not
think
that
a
letter
that
“i
will
solicit
house
to
house
for
some
unnamed
cause
or
some
unnamed
person”
could
answer
the
question
of
identity.
the
question
is
what
are
you
doing
in
the
town?
mr.
james
a.
major
that
would
be
y
interpretation,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
a.
major
no,
sir,
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
below,
it
refers
to
what
is
called
chilling,
whatever
that
means.
i
will
take
it.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
pretty
close
to
a
freeze
to
deter
the
average
political
candidate
from
announcing
what
he
is
running
for
because
unless
he
says
that,
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
solicit
votes.
mr.
james
a.
major
i
suppose
they
are
going
to
solicit
signatures
for
a
nominating
petition,
sir
and
they
ring
a
door
bell.
surely,
they
would
have
to
say
“this
is
a
nominating
position
for
mr.
hynes
and
mr.
burn
or
somebody
or
other,
would
you
sign
it”
and
what
they
are
running
for.
otherwise,
you
would
be
put
in
a
position
of
saying
“here,
i
have
a
petition,
would
you
sign
it”
and
in
so
far
as
amenity
is
concerned,
assume
it
will
take
the
town
a
size
of
oradell
that
you
are
stopping
at
house
to
house,
it
becomes
known
that
you
are
soliciting.
now,
in
all
of
these
cases,
i
recognize
fully
that
you
have
competing
principles
driving
for
mastery.
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
we
want,
as
i
said,
is
to
keep
anybody
from
running
for
office
or
for
soliciting.
we
thought
this
was
a
way
we
could
do
it.
now,
in
the
arguments
made
here
which
was
not
made
below,
we
have
this
question
as
to
a
type
of
identification
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
what
we
wanted
to
find
out
and
what
we
dropped
in
the
laps
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
when
we
amended
the
ordinance
is
can
we
do
this?
now,
if
it
is
a
fact
that
there
are
some
facets
of
this
ordinance
which
require
amplification,
no
reason
in
the
world
why
that
cannot
be
done.
the
point
that
we
are
leaving
with
the
court
is
we
would
like
to
know
if
consistent
with
the
constitution,
we
can
adapt
an
ordinance
towards
this
end
and
the
reason
for
it
is
quite
obvious.
now,
they
said
to
us
“no
testimony
taken.”
obviously,
the
trial
court
proceeded
on
what
is
called
a
facial
attack
on
the
ordinance.
if
there
was,
in
fact,
some
question
as
to
whether
the
police
needed
this
kind
of
an
implement
that
testimony
could
have
been
produced
by
the
number
of
unsolved
murders.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
this
case
was
pending,
in
the
adjacent
town
of
howell,
a
woman
by
the
name
of
hynes
not
related
to
this
petitioner
was
taken
from
a
home,
taken
some
place
and
killed,
from
her
home.
somebody
is
going
to
say
“well,
are
the
women
of
oradell
not
constituted
of
sterner
stuff?”
the
answer
is,
“apparently
they
are
not,”
but
that
is
the
point
i
leave
with
the
court.
we
are
interested
in
this
$64
question,
is
this
a
condition
subject
to
municipal
regulation?
if
the
particular
ordinance
goes
too
far,
that
is
one
thing,
but
as
i
understood,
at
the
trial
level,
the
trial
judge
said
“you
cannot
do
it
at
all”
and
there
is
where
we
parted
company.
