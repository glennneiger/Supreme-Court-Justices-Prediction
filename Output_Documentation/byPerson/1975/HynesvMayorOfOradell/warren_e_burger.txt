we
will
hear
arguments
next
in

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.

are
there
any
of
these
ordinances,
mr.
taylor,
present
as
a
person
required
to
receive
a
card
that
is
used
as
identification
somewhere?

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree,
mr.
taylor,
that
the
police
authorities
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
a
great
many
breaking
and
entering
cases,
attacks
on
householder
have
come
by
people
who
gained
entry
by
getting
the
door
open
by
processes,
by
representing
themselves
in
some
way
as
a
solicitor
or
a
caller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
irrational
for
the
decision
makers
to
conclude
that
since
this
does
happen
in
some
places,
they
are
entitled
to
take
preventive
measures
to
see
that
it
does
not
happen
in
oradell
or
do
you
think
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
consideration?

mr.

chief

mr.
ordell’s
town
councilman,
what
is
the
town’s
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
taylor.
do
you
see
anything
in
the
ordinance,
mr.
taylor,
that
requires
you
to
identify
the
particular
objective
of
your
solicitation,
that
is,
would
it
be
sufficient
if
you
sent
a
postcard
and
said
“beginning
next
week,
i
intend
to
solicit
support
for
my
favorite
candidate
in
the
upcoming
election”?

new
jersey
practice,
if
you
are
that
familiar
with
it,
could
not
the
courts,
as
most
courts
could,
have
a
narrowing
construction
of
this
ordinance
say
that
you
need
not
specify
a
party
or
a
candidate,
but
merely
are
required
to
say
that
you
will
be
soliciting
support
in
connection
with
that
election?

(inaudible)
i
mean,
the
state
courts
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
know
that
any
times
are
indicated
here,
but
would
you
think
it
would
be
fatal
to
such
a
provision
if
it
said
“during
daylight
hours
only”
or
“not
after
9
p.m.”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
limitations
of
daylight
hours
might
be
unreasonable
with
limitation
to
canvassing
up
to
9
p.m.,
would
be
reasonable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
