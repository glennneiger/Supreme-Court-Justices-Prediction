mr.
joel
l.
selig
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
prior
to
1972,
title
vii
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
did
not
apply
to
the
federal
government.
in
1972,
title
vii
was
amended
so
as
to
make
unlawful
under
title
vii,
discrimination
by
federal
agencies
and
departments.
the
1972
amendments
also
provided
to
federal
employees
and
applicants
for
employment
a
right
to
file
a
civil
action
in
a
united
states
district
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
nature
and
the
scope
of
that
civil
action.
petitioner
contends
that
it
is
a
plenary
judicial
proceeding
and
the
respondents
contend
that
it
is
a
review
of
the
administrative
record
pursuant
to
a
substantial
evidence
standard.
petitioner
is
a
black
female
employee
of
the
veterans
administration.
in
1972,
she
applied
for
a
gs-13
supervisory
claims
examiner
position.
she
was
designated
as
highly
qualified
for
the
position
but
a
filipino-american
male
was
selected.
she
thereupon
filed
a
compliant
alleging
that
she
had
been
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
her
race
and
sex.
an
investigation
was
conducted
and
after
the
investigation
petitioner
was
offered
the
option
of
either
receiving
a
final
agency
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
investigative
file
without
an
administrative
evidentiary
hearing
or
the
option
of
receiving
a
final
agency
decision
after
an
administrative
evidentiary
hearing.
she
selected
the
second
option.
petitioner
is
not
an
attorney.
she
represented
herself
at
the
hearing.
she
requested
that
24
witnesses
be
called
to
testify
and
the
examiner
declined
to
call
15
of
the
24
witnesses
requested.
nevertheless,
the
examiner
found
partially
in
petitioner’s
favor.
she
found
that
petitioner
had
been
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
her
sex
but
that
she
had
not
been
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
her
race.
the
examiner
recommended
that
petitioner
be
promoted
immediately
and
retroactively
to
the
position
in
question.
the
examiner’s
findings
however
are
only
recommendations
to
the
head
of
the
agency
or
his
designee
and
the
veterans
administration
accepted
the
examiners
finding
that
there
had
been
no
race
discrimination
but
rejected
the
finding
that
there
had
been
sex
discrimination.
petitioner
at
that
point
had
the
option
of
filing
suit
in
the
district
court
or
appealing
to
the
civil
service
commission.
she
chose
the
second
option.
the
civil
service
commission
affirmed
the
agency’s
decision.
this
suit
followed.
in
the
district
court
petitioner
sought
discovery,
she
sought
initially
to
take
two
depositions
and
she
requested
production
of
documents
in
connection
with
one
of
these
depositions.
the
district
court
however
granted
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
record
in
favor
of
the
defendants
with
no
discovery
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
the
positions
--
the
issue
in
this
case
is
sharply
drawn
and
the
positions
of
the
parties
on
stark
conflict.
i
think
that
the
issue
can
be
stated
in
terms
of
two
interrelated
questions:
one,
who
is
the
finder
of
fact
in
this
kind
of
case,
is
it
the
court
or
is
it
the
agency;
and
secondly
what
evidence
may
be
considered
by
the
court.
may
the
court
consider
all
relevant
evidence
or
is
the
court
limited
to
considering
the
evidence
contained
in
the
administrative
record?
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
the
statute
specifically
contemplates
that
suit
maybe
filed
in
either
situation
and
makes
no
distinction
between
them.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
right.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
of
course,
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
only
thing
added
by
the
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
is
a
further,
is
a
review
of
the
record
by
the
civil
service
commission.
there
is
no
additional
opportunity.
there
is
an
opportunity
to
make
representations,
written
representations
to
the
commission
but
there
is
no
hearing
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct.
petitioner’s
position
on
this
two
interrelated
issues
is
that
the
court
is
the
finder
of
fact
and
that
the
plaintiff
should
be
permitted
to
discover
and
introduce
all
relevant
evidence
pursuant
to
the
standards
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures
applied
in
all
other
title
vii
cases.
if
the
court
adopts
our
theory,
plaintiffs,
in
federal
sector
cases,
would
have
no
more
procedural
rights
in
district
courts
than
plaintiffs
in
any
other
title
vii
cases
and
they
would
have
no
less
rights
in
district
courts
than
all
other
plaintiffs.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
it
is
our
assumption
--
in
the
first
place
let
me
say
that
normally
there
is
no
objection
by
anyone
to
admission
of
the
administrative
record
but
we
believe
that
the
administrative
decision
is
clearly
admissible.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that.
it
is
a
finding
of
an
agency.
it
is
a
business
record.
it
is
also
our
assumption
that
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
it
is
our
position
that
certainly
the
agency
decision
and
the
civil
service
commission
is
admissible
and
i
am
aware
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
it
is
a
--
i
think
that
findings
of
agencies
are
normally
admissible
whether
or
not
the
judicial
proceeding
is
a
de
novo
proceeding
and
it
is
also
a
business
record.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
no
your
honor,
not
to
--
it
does
not
follow
from
the
fact
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
it
would
depend.
it
would
be
a
--
it
would
depend
entirely
on
the
nature
of
the
questions
involved
in
the
case
and
what
is
contained
in
the
administrative
record
and
the
administrative
decision.
but
the
court
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
there
is
no
is
not
a
jury
trial
at
the
time
so
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
this
court
in
alexander
against
gardner-denver
company
addressed
that
question
in
a
footnote
and
said
we
adopt
no
rule.
it
depends
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
and
i
would
think
that
the
same
would
apply
here.
but
the
important
thing
about
the
footnote
in
alexander
is
that
it
says
that
the
administrative
decision
is
admissible.
it
maybe
accorded
some
weight
but
that
refers
to
its
weight
as
one
piece
of
evidence
along
with
any
other
evidence
that
it
is
admitted.
and
the
footnote
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
i
would
like
to
respond
on
that
but
i
would
like
to
finish
what
i
was
saying
about
the
footnote
which
is
that
the
record
is
admissible.
it
is
entitled
to
whatever
weight
makes
sense
in
the
particular
circumstances,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
it
maybe
used
as
a
reason
for
excluding
other
evidence.
and
the
court
goes
on
in
the
footnote
in
alexander
to
say
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
assure
the
full
availability
of
the
judicial
forum.
now,
the
arbitration
process
is
not
a
statutory
proceeding
under
title
vii.
however,
in
alexander
the
court
also
considered
and
rejected
a
proposed
rule
of
deferral
to
arbitral
decisions
which
the
fifth
circuit
had
adopted
in
the
case
called
rios
against
reynolds
metal
company.
and
the
conditions
which
the
fifth
circuit
set
for
deferral
were,
one
that
the
contractual
right
must
coincide
with
rights
under
title
vii.
two,
and
i
--
well,
i
will
not
go
into
them
unless
the
court
wishes
but
there
were
a
number
of
conditions
which
would
have
to
be
satisfied
under
the
rios
test
for
deferring
to
an
arbitral
decision
and
the
very
first
condition
was
that
the
arbitral,
the
rights
under
the
contract
must
be
congruent
with
title
vii.
and
the
court
held
in
alexander
that
even
if
that
were
so
deferral
would
be
inappropriate
and
there
should
be
a
trial
de
novo.
now
the
government’s
position
is
explicitly
that
the
agency
is
the
finder
of
fact
in
these
matters
subject
to
substantial
evidence
review
in
the
courts.
and
that
the
court
should
normally
defer
to
the
findings
and
decision
of
the
agency.
furthermore,
the
government’s
position
is
that
in
the
ordinary
case
there
is
no
discovery
in
the
district
court
and
the
record
before
the
reviewing
court
must
be
limited
to
the
record
made
by
the
defendants
--
by
the
defendant
agency.
under
this
rule,
the
federal
government
would
be
placed
in
a
class
all
by
itself
exempt
from
plenary
judicial
scrutiny.
we
think
that
it
is
important
to
understand
what
review
on
the
record
pursuant
to
a
substantial
evidence
test
means.
and
professor
jaffe
has
explained
it
as
follows,
under
the
substantial
evidence
test
the
court
will
be
required
to
sustain
a
finding
which
it
believes
to
be
incorrect
and
even
against
the
weight
of
evidence,
because
it
is
the
agency
and
not
the
court
which
finds
the
facts.
so
long
as
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
that
could
support
the
agency’s
decision,
the
court
must
accept
that
decision
even
if
it
would
believe
it
to
be
wrong
making
an
independent
judgment.
we
think
that
such
a
posture
by
a
district
court
in
a
federal
sector
title
vii
cases
would
be
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
court’s
function
as
the
finder
of
fact
and
as
the
decider
of
what
relief
should
be
provided.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
was
just
trying
to
point
out
that
the
government’s
rule
would
be
completely
inconsistent,
what
the
rule
is,
in
the
private
sector
and
in
the
state
and
local
sector
onto
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
this
particular
statute,
its
particular
language,
its
particular
legislative
history
and
its
particular
purpose.
and
certainly
we
would
not
deny
that
review
on
the
record
is
the
rule
in
large
numbers
of
cases.
and
congress
could
have
provided
for
that
if
it
had
wanted
to
do
so.
and
in
that
regard
it
is
particularly
significant
that
the
draft
legislation
which
would
have
provided
cease
and
desist
authority
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
the
private
sector
would
have
explicitly
provide
it
for
review
on
the
record
in
the
courts
of
appeals
pursuant
to
a
substantial
evidence
standard.
this
was
written
into
the
draft
legislation.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
justice
stewart,
72,
that
is
correct.
and
that
was
defeated.
congress
knew
how
to
provide
for
review
on
the
record
if
it
wanted
to
do
so
and
they
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
no,
and
that
is
the
second
point
in
our
favor
mr.
justice
stewart
which
is
that
even
that
draft
legislation
did
not
apply
to
the
federal
sector
and
federal
sector
cases
were
governed
by
completely
different
section
of
the
draft
legislation.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
consider
one
of
the
arguments
which
was
made
in
favor
of
cease
and
desist
and
court
of
appeals
review
in
the
private
sector.
and
that
argument
was
that
it
would
be
to
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
district
courts
to
trial
these
cases
de
novo.
there
was
repeated
reference
to
the
problem
of
congestion
in
the
dockets
of
the
lower
courts
and
a
repeatedly
expressed
reason
in
favor
of
agency
enforcement
rather
than
court
enforcement
in
the
private
sector
was
that
this
would
relieve
the
burdens
on
the
district
courts.
that
argument
may
have
been
valid,
but
it
was
rejected
by
the
congress,
and
i
think
that
that
has
special
significance
here.
in
that
regard,
this
is
why
we
believe
that
the
comments
of
senator
dominick
have
special
significance
here.
there
would
be
no
1972
amendments
without
senator
dominick
because
couture
could
not
have
been
obtained
unless
the
congress
had
agreed
to
senator
dominick’s
amendment
which
would
have
substituted
--
which
would
have
indeed
substitute
court
enforcement
in
the
private
sector
for
cease
and
desist
enforcement
in
the
private
sector.
and
that
senator
dominick
repeatedly
expressed
his
concern
that
all
parties,
plaintiffs
and
defendants
in
private
industry,
in
state
and
local
governments
and
in
the
federal
government
should
have
their
claims
adjudicated
pursuant
to
the
same
procedures
and
by
the
same
fact
finder,
i.e.,
by
an
independent
united
states
district
judge
who
would
independently
determine
the
merits
of
their
case.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
it
already
existed
mr.
justice
white
in
substantially
the
same
form
prior
to
the
enactment.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
they
were
referring
to
providing
the
same
remedies
in
court.
and
i
would
also
like
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
it
has
different
remedies
with
respect
to
federal
agencies.i
would
also
point
out
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
private
sector
employees
and
state
and
local
employees
frequently
have
remedies
at
the
state
and
local
level
pursuant
to
state
fair
employment
practice
statutes.
for
example,
the
minnesota
and
in
michigan
for
example
and
many
other
states.
you
have
a
local
fair
employment
practice
agency
which
has
cease
and
desist
authority
over
the
private
the
sector
and
over
state
and
local
employees,
which
provides
trial
type
adversary
hearings
with
discovery
and
compulsory
process
and
private
sector
employees
are
required
to
exhaust
those
procedures
before
they
can
even
complain
to
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
under
title
vii.
there
maybe
many
employees
in
that
situation
who
have
a
full
trial
type
adversary
hearing
at
the
state
or
local
level
before
they
come
into
federal
court
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
you
mean
under
other
basis
or
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
he
gets
review
on
the
record
at
the
court’s
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
there
has
traditionally
been
a
remedy
in
the
district
courts.
but
the
courts
are
divided
as
to
what
the
basis
for
that
remedy
is.
they
are
divided
also
with
respect
what
standard
of
review
is
applicable.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
not
to
my
knowledge
and
the
dc
circuit
has
criticized
that
on
numerous
occasions
and
the
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
no,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct.
but
this,
the
whole
point
is
i
believe
that
this
apparently
existed
prior
to
the
1972
amendments
and
it
did
not
exist
under
this
statute.
and
the
question
is,
what
are
the
procedures
to
be
followed
under
this
statute.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
i
think
that
was
a
substantial
part
of
his
position.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
no,
but
it
would
apply
with
respect,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
federal
employee,
an
applicant
for
employment,
and
that
concern
was
repeatedly
expressed.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
at
this
point.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
mr.
justice
marshall
credulity
is
certainly
was
an
issue
in
this
case
and
i
would
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
pages
63
through
67
of
the
certified
administrative
record.
these
pages
are
not
produced
in
the
appendix.
it
is
part
of
the
testimony
of
the
selecting
supervisor.
the
civil
service
commission,
in
affirming
the
agency
decision,
repeatedly
relied
upon
the
explanations
of
the
selecting
supervisor
as
to
why
he
selected
mr.
deniro
(ph)
rather
than
mrs.
chandler.
and
if
you
look
at
the
pages
that
i
am
citing
you
to,
i
think
you
will
see
the
reason
why
the
complaints
examiner
at
least
find
no
credibility
in
those
explanations.
the
court,
of
course,
had
no
opportunity
to
hear
mr.
holland
(ph)
testify
and
one
of
the
first
acts
that
petitioner
did
in
district
court
was
to
try
to
take
mr.
holland’s
deposition
and
i
suppose
you
would
have
called
him
as
a
witness
in
the
district
court.
now
it
is
also
suggested
that
these
cases
are
so
complicated
and
it
is
so
difficult
to
distinguish
between
discrimination
and
a
valid
personnel
procedure
that
the
courts
will
not
be
able
to
understand
these
cases
and
deal
with
them.

in

of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
cited
the
case
of
united
states
against
united
states
steel
corporation.
that
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
was
the
plaintiff.
we
would
commend
that
the
court’s
attention
and
there
are
several
different
opinions
in
there,
that
is
a
case
which
is
extremely
complicated
and
yet
the
court
was
able
to
deal
with
it,
the
lines
of
progression,
the
way
in
which
the
united
states
steel
in
birmingham
operates,
requires
a
great
deal
of
expertise
to
even
begin
to
understand
what
is
going
on
at
the
united
states
steel
corporation.
and
yet
the
courts
have
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
thing
everyday.
they
also
have
to
deal
with
testing
which
is
extremely
complicated.
now
we
think
it
is
significant
with
respect
to
the
question
of
a
hearing
that
the
statute
does
not
require
that
these
cases
be
determined
after
a
hearing
nor
is
the
commission.
in
the
draft
legislation
providing
for
cease
and
desist
review
in
the
private
sector
and
review
on
the
record
on
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
committee
bill,
the
hawkins
bill,
those
draft
legislation
required
that
hearings
be
conducted
by
the
eeoc.
they
also
contain
the
stay
provision
to
which
counsel
referred.
of
course
neither
the
stay
provision
nor
the
provision
requiring
a
hearing
a
hearing
in
the
private
sector
is
contained
in
the
statute
as
enacted.
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
function
of
the
court
to
read
things
into
the
statute
which
are
not
there
particularly
when
they
were
there
under
antecedent
draft
legislation.
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct.
now
of
course
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
middle
positions
which
have
been
assumed
by
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
obviously
this
court
is
not
bounded
by
the
positions
advocated
by
either
party
but
we
feel
very
strongly
that
these
middle
positions
are
also
completely
inadequate
and
we
have
discussed
the
reasons
for
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
indeed
we
think
the
government’s
position
implicitly
recognizes
that
there
is
no
middle
ground
in
this
area
either
the
court
is
the
finder
of
fact
or
the
agency
is
the
finder
of
fact.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
very
narrow
exception,
your
honor
i
would
suggest.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
that
is
correct,
but
--
and
i
think
the
exceptions
that
they
are
recognizing
are
very
narrow.
but
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
the
problem
--
there
are
several
problems
with
this
middle
rules
which
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
adopted
and
which
are
not
being
advocated
by
the
government,
but
one
big
problem
with
them
is
that
they
put
the
burden
on
the
wrong
party.
they
put
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
a
need
to
go
beyond
the
administrative
record.
they
put
a
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
discovery,
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
other
witnesses
testified.
well,
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
if
discovery
is
inappropriate,
it
is
the
defendant’s
burden
to
show
that
it
is
inappropriate
under
the
rules
and
under
the
applicable
case
law.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
you
are
starting
--
well
first
of
all
mr.
chief
justice
i
do
not
think
it
is
contended
by
anyone
that
the
commission
has
primary
jurisdiction
in
the
normal
sense
if
that
word,
but
i
am
starting
from
scratch
as
far
as
the
complainant
having
control
over
the
development
of
his
case.
mr.
joel
l.
selig
well,
as
we
have
said,
we
assume
that
the
administrative
record
is
admissible.
we
also
assume
that
duplication
without
a
purpose
can
be
prevented
by
the
district
court.
but
i
think
the
important
phrases
as
judge
leventhal
stated
it,
duplication
without
a
purpose,
sometimes
there
is
a
purpose
in
duplication.
frequently
in
antitrust
cases,
there
are
large
numbers
of
depositions
that
have
been
taken.
this
is
true
in
many
areas
of
the
law.
i
think
finally
that
--
of
course
it
is
conceded
by
the
government
as
it
would
have
to
be
conceded
in
the
light
of
morton
against
mancari
that
what
we
are
up
to
here
is
providing
the
same
substantive
law,
the
same
substantive
rights
in
the
federal
sectors
and
the
private
sector.
it
is
our
position
basically
that
you
cannot
separate
substance
and
procedure
in
this
area.
and
this
is
why
we
believe
the
court
noted
in
alexander
that
the
choice
of
forms
inevitably
affects
the
scope
of
the
substantive
right
to
be
vindicated.
and
this
is
why
we
believe
that
the
general
principle
which
is
applicable
here
is
the
principle
stated
in
the
house
committee
report
and
quoted
by
the
court
in
mancari.
and
that
is
that
the
present
law
in
the
proposed
statute
do
not
permit
industry
and
labor
organizations
to
be
the
judges
of
their
own
conduct
in
the
area
of
employment
discrimination,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
government
agencies
should
not
be
treated
similarly.
thank
you.
