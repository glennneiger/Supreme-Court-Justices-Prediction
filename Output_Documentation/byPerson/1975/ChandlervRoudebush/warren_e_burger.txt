chief

e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-1599,
chandler
against
roudebush.
mr.
selig
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
not
suggesting
a
mixed
procedure
partly
agency
review
and
partly
trial
de
novo?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
fact
could
be
given,
what
constructions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
assumes
the
conclusion,
does
it
not?
you
say
as
the
finder
of
facts,
the
whole
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
or
the
agency
administrative
tribunal
is
the
finder
of
facts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
true
in
a
great
many
other
areas,
is
it
not,
a
judicial
review
of
administrative
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
review
those
status,
mr.
lee,
the
employeeâ€™s
options
first
within
the
agency
briefly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
within
the
agency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
the
reviewing
of
the
same
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
civil
service
commission
would
review
the
record
last
made
or
if
he
took
the
route
to
the
district
court,
that
would
be
the
basis
of
judicial
review.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
elapsed
time,
from
beginning
to
end,
not
the
time
consumed
in
that
number
of
days,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
alternative
that
your
friends
are
suggesting
is
that
this
being
trusted
to
403
or
425
federal
district
judges
who
would
treat
the
matter
as
any
other
kind
--
as
any
other
independent
kind
of
litigation
trying
it
de
novo.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
start
from
the
scratch
here
as
you
would
be
in
a
civil
action
in
the
district
court
in
its
primary
jurisdiction,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
suggesting
that
the
plaintiff
--
i
am
suggesting
that
the
complaining
party
has
had
a
good
deal
of
procedure
up
to
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
