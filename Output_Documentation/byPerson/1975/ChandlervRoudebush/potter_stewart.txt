justice
potter
stewart
do
you
admit
that
the
possibility
that
the
mode
of
trial
in
a
district
court
might
be
one
way
had
there
been
no
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
but
on
another
way
if
as
in
this
case
there
was,
i
suppose,
you,
representing
the
clients
you
do,
would
not
admit
of
any
possibility
that
--
because
your
client
did
take
an
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
suit
maybe
filed
within
30
days
after
the
final
agency
decision,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
or
within
15
days
after
the
final
agency
decision
then
appeal
maybe
taken
to
civil
service
commission
then
it
is
a
180-day.
i
know
the
option,
but
my
question
was
do
you
--
and
probably
i
know
now
your
answer
because
i
realize
the
position
that
your
client
is
in.
but
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
the
answer
might
be
--
the
mode
of
trial
might
be
in
one
way.
where
there
was
no
appeal
with
civil
service
commission
and
in
another
way
where
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
in
an
appellate
court
certainly.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
appeal
on
the
record,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
when,
in
65
or
in
72?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
proposed
provision
was
applicable
to
federal
employees
only?
justice
potter
stewart
then
how
it
--
and
yet
it
is
very
cleat
that
an
employee
claiming
discrimination
can
wholly
avoid
such
review
and
go
into
the
federal
district
court
after
his
agency
has
acted.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
agency?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you
say
applicable
to
the
very
first
processing
of
the
very
first
administrative
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
done
by
a
civil
service
personnel?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any,
even
conceivable
conditions
under
which
a
federal
employee
could
go
to
the
eeoc,
they
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
just
not.
justice
potter
stewart
the
complainant
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lee,
my
question
is,
if
i
may,
throughout
your
brief
you
keep
--
you
emphasize
and
repeat
that
the
rule
that
you
proposed
of
review
on
an
administrative
record
should
be
the
rule
in
the
ordinary
case,
that
it
should
be
the
general
rule,
and
you
make
very
explicit
that
there
--
you
concede
that
maybe
in
our
exceptions,
exceptions
when
there
has
been
an
inordinate
delay
in
the
administrative
review
and
another
exception
you
suggest
when
a
witness
has
not
been
amenable
to
compulsory
process
because
he
is
not
a
government
employee
and
you
suggest
there
may
be
others.
is
this
--
do
you
know
of
any
other
situation
where
the
court
has
an
option
of
either
reviewing
something
on
the
administrative
record
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
true
in
labor
board
cases
for
example,
review
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
ever
heard
one
where
the
court
of
appeals
took
additional
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
reviewing
agency
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
many
administrative
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
is
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
the
reviewing
court
in
most
modern,
as
you
well
know.
and
do
you
know
of
any
other
--
do
you
know
of
any
analog
to
what
you
suggest?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
suggest
there
may
be
others.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
is
my
understanding
correct
that
here
a
complainant
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
hearing
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
his
agency?
justice
potter
stewart
and
only
he
may
waive
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
government
case,
if
not
a
middle
position,
it
does
not
take
--
it
admits
of
exceptions
to
what
it
--
to
the
rule
that
it
advocates.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
concedes
54:08
that
the
rule
it
advocates
maybe
inadequate
or
defective
in
certain
circumstances,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
case
in
which
i
am
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
this
morning
is
number
74-1599,
jewell
v.
chandler,
petitioner
against
richard
l.
roudebush
and
others,
respondents,
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1972,
as
i
just
mentioned,
congress
extended
the
protection
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
to
employees
of
the
federal
government.
a
principal
goal
of
the
amending
legislation,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972,
was
to
eradicate
entrenched
discrimination
in
the
federal
service
by
strengthening
internal
safeguards
and
by
according
aggrieved
federal
employees
or
applicants,
the
full
rights
available
in
the
courts
as
are
granted
to
individuals
in
the
private
sector
under
title
vii.
i
just
read
a
quotation
from
the
senate
committee
report.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
1972
act
gives
federal
employees
the
same
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
on
employment
discrimination
claims
as
so
called
"private
sector"
employees
enjoy
under
title
vii.
the
petitioner,
mrs.
jewell
chandler,
is
a
negro.
in
1972,
she
was
employed
as
a
claims
examiner
by
the
veterans'
administration.
in
august
of
that
year
she
applied
for
a
promotion
to
the
position
of
supervisory
claims
examiner.
following
a
selection
procedure,
she
was
designated
as
one
of
three
finalists
for
the
position.
the
promotion
was
awarded
to
a
filipino-american
male.
the
petitioner
subsequently
filed
a
complaint
with
the
veterans'
administration,
alleging
that
she
had
been
denied
the
promotion
because
of
unlawful
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
both
sex
and
race.
after
an
administrative
hearing
on
the
claim,
the
presiding
complaints
examiner
submitted
proposed
findings
to
the
effect
that
the
petitioner
had
been
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
sex,
but
not
race
and
recommended
that
she
be
given
a
retroactive
promotion
to
the
position
for
which
she
had
applied.
the
agency
rejected
the
proposed
finding
of
sex
discrimination
as
not
"substantiated
by
the
evidence,"
and
accordingly
granted
no
relief
since
it
accepted
that
the
examiner's
proposed
finding
had
no
race
discrimination.
the
petitioner
filed
a
timely
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
board
of
appeals
and
review,
which
affirmed
the
agency's
decision.
within
30
days
after
receiving
notice
of
the
commission's
decision,
the
petitioner
brought
the
present
suit
in
a
federal
district
court
under
section
717
(c)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
as
amended
in
1972,
her
suit
was
theretofore
timely
under
that
statute.
after
moving
unsuccessfully
for
summary
judgment,
she
initiated
discovery
proceedings
by
filing
notice
of
two
depositions
and
a
request
for
the
production
of
documents.
the
respondents,
the
defendants
moved
for
an
order
prohibiting
discovery
on
the
ground
that
the
judicial
action
authorized
by
section
717
is
limited
to
a
review
of
the
administrative
record.
the
petitioner
opposed
that
motion
asserting
that
she
had
a
right
under
717
to
a
plenary
judicial
trial
on
the
merits
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
held
that
a
trial
de
novo
is
not
required
under
section
717
and
that
review
of
the
administrative
record
is
sufficient
if
an
absence
of
discrimination
is
affirmatively
established
by
the
clear
weight
of
the
evidence
in
the
record.
applying
this
standard
of
review,
the
district
court
determined
that
the
absence
of
discrimination
is
firmly
established
by
the
clear
weight
of
the
administrative
record
and
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
judgment,
agreeing
with
the
district
court
that
section
717
does
not
contemplate
a
trial
de
novo
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
concerning
the
nature
of
the
judicial
proceeding
provided
by
section
717
(c)
and
important
and
recurring
questions
in
the
administration
of
this
new
and
important
federal
law.
for
the
reasons
set
out
at
some
length
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
mistaken
in
concluding
that
section
717
(c)
does
not
accord
a
federal
employee
the
same
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
as
private
sector
employees
enjoy
under
title
vii.
the
judgment,
therefore,
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
