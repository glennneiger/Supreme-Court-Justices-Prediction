justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee
is
this
a
point
of
whether
congress
might
have
said
so
explicitly
taking
the
otherâ€™s
sides
position
explicitly?
are
there
any
other
federal
statutes
that
have
been
construed
to
limit
court
review
to
the
administrative
record
where
the
statute
is
not
expressly
so
stated?
