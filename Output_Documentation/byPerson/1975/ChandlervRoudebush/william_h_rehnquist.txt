justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
rule
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
administrative
record
under
your
theory
that
you
say.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
do
not
know
that
that
necessarily
follows
if
your
theory
is
this
is
a
de
novo
trial,
presumably
those
issues
of
fact
are
for
the
court
or
the
jury.
and
ordinarily
you
cannot
admit
a
business
record
to
prove
a
fact
that
is
ultimately
within
the
jury’s
confidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
theory
if
it
is
really
a
de
novo
trial
starting
all
over
again?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
judge
charge
the
jury
as
to
the
weight
to
be
given.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
what
does
the
judge
--
what
rule
does
he
follow
as
to
the
weight
that
should
be
given.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
a
contractual
grievance
--
that
was
a
contractual
grievance
proceeding,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
not
a
good
deal
of
the
opposition
to
giving
the
eeoc
cease
and
desist
orders
from
private
employers
who
felt
that
it
might
give
them
less
than
a
fair
shake?
was
that
not
mostly
senator
dominick’s
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
same
argument
certainly
would
not
apply
from
the
point
of
the
federal
government
fearing
that
the
civil
service
commission
would
not
give
it
a
fair
shake.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
your
opponents
also
suggest
that
congress
was
not
all
that
convinced
that
the
civil
service
commission
had
this
high
degree
of
expertise
in
the
field
of
equal
opportunity,
in
fact
that
it
had
been
lagging
some
and
that
is
the
reason
they
had
advanced,
is
there
not
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
was
the
feeling
of
congress.
