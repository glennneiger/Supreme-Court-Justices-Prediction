mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
ot
please
the
court.
taken
in
isolation,
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
would
support
a
respectable
argument
for
either
record
review
or
de
novo
trials.
the
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
believe
are
the
more
persuasive
view
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
it
supports
a
record
review
interpretation.
but
the
most
persuasive
insight
into
congressional
intent
is
provided
by
the
fact
that
beyond
any
dispute,
congress
intended
to
vest
and
did
vest
the
front
line
responsibility
for
insuring
equal
employment
opportunity
in
the
federal
sector
in
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
depends,
mr.
justice
stewart
on
how
broadly
you
consider
the
civil
service
commission
and
its
responsibility
in
this
area.
it
is
true
that
up
to
the
point
of
appeal
to
the
appeals
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission
that
it
is
a
shared
responsibility
between
civil
service
commission
and
agency.
but
everything
that
agency
does
from
the
beginning
of
the
conciliation
process
through
the
investigation,
through
the
attempt
to
add
adjustment
of
the
complaint
and
including
the
hearing
itself
is
conducted
pursuant
to
civil
service
commission
regulations
according
to
procedures
that
have
been
prescribed
by
the
civil
service
commission.
and
at
the
time
that
you
get
to
the
hearing
and
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
skip
that
and
go
into
court,
well
unless
the
complainant
waives
it.
but
at
the
time,
at
the
time
that
you
go
to
the
hearing
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
only
place
there
is
the
hearing,
in
the
agency.
that
hearing
is
conducted
is
presided
over
by
a
full
time
civil
service
commission
examiner,
certified
and
trained
by
the
civil
service
commission.
he
is
not
an
agency
employee.
so
that
really
--
and
i
appreciate
you
pointing
this
out,
when
i
talk
about
the
civil
service
commission,
and
this
is
the
thrust
of
our
position,
we
are
really
talking
about
a
shared
agency
responsibility,
civil
service
commission
and
agency.
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
entire
procedure
is
conducted
under
the
aegis
of
the
civil
service
commission
pursuant
to
its
regulations
and
under
its
overall
supervision
and
control.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
very
first,
the
very
first
step
starts
on
page
28a
of
our
appendix,
talks
about
the
counseling
procedure
and
that
is
pursuant
to
civil
service
commission
regulations.
now
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
not
personnel,
the
personnel
comes
into
the
point
at
the
hearing
examiner
but
pursuant
to
civil
service
commission
regulations.
it
is
further
significant
that
whereas
we
are
concerned
today
with
the
adjudication
of
a
particular
complaint,
this
adjudication
process
is
a
part,
an
integral
part,
of
a
much
larger
whole
equal
employment
opportunity
effort
by
the
federal
government.
it
is
all
subject
to
the
direction
office,
it
is
under
a
single
office,
under
a
single
director,
and
additional
component
parts
of
this
overall
effort
are
in
addition
to
the
adjudication
process.
there
is
a
continuing
process
carried
out
by
the
bureau
of
personnel
and
management
evaluation,
which
evaluates
programs
on
a
continuing
basis.
in
addition,
the
statute
charges
the
civil
service
commission
with
the
review
and
approval
of
equal
employment
opportunity
plans
on
a
regional
and
national
level
and
finally
the
civil
service
commission
is
charged
with
training
an
upward
mobility,
affirmative
action
programs
throughout
the
entire
federal
government.
so
that
the
federal
judge,
when
he
considers
a
particularly
equal
employment
opportunity
case,
gets
the
picture
that
is
presented
by
that
case.
the
civil
service
commission,
by
contrast,
has
the
adjudication
process
as
a
component
part
of
a
much
broader
overall
program
and
this,
this
was
the
thrust
of
judge
gisele’s
opinion
in
hackley
versus
johnson.
he
made
the
very
significant
observation
which
is
true
that
it
is
almost
impossible
in
the
usual
case,
federal
case,
to
differentiate
between
claims
appear
discrimination
on
the
one
hand
and
the
related
problems,
the
necessarily
related
problems
of
promotion,
hiring,
training
and
general
affirmative
action
and
up
--
well,
no,
promotion,
hiring
and
training
and
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
are
promotion
cases.
judge
gisele’s
conclusion
in
a
single
statement
--
in
a
single
sense
which
i
quote
is,
that
“the
commission’s
growing
expertise
in
civil
rights
matters
coupled
with
its
preeminent
expertise
in
this
latter
areas
emphasizes
that
an
automatic
trial
de
novo
will
not
the
serve
the
laudable
purpose
of
the
act.”
it
is
further
instructive
to
note
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
white
that
regardless
of
how
you
decide
this
case,
the
government
is
going
to
be
in
a
class
by
itself.
congress
simply
did
not
go
the
same
route
with
regard
to
the
private
sector
and
the
federal
sector.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
just
do
not
have
jurisdiction
on
it.
that
is
right.
that
was
--
i
guess
next
to
the
question
of
cease
and
desist
authority.
that
was
the
biggest
debate
in
congress
and
the
contrast
is
remarkable.
this
eeoc
simply
does
not
have
substantive
remedial
authority.
it
lost
that
one
in
congress.
and
as
a
consequence,
the
limit
of
what
they
can
do
is
conciliation
and
persuasion.
that
is
really
the
first
step
in
the
federal
sector.
now
the
federal
employee
by
contrast
has
really
two
points
arguably
three
at
which
he
can
win
and
win
affirmatively
and
have
the
kind
of
back
pay,
reinstatement,
promotion,
whatever
prior
to
the
time
that
he
ever
gets
into
court.
so
the
concept
of
equality
is
not
a
relevant
one.
that
is
a
matter
that
is
simply
precluded
because
of
the
structure
of
the
act
as
set
out
by
congress.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
be
happy
to
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
step
is
that
the
complains
of
an
act
of
discrimination
at
that
point
a
counselor
is
appointed,
an
equal
opportunity
counselor
is
appointed
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
within
the
agency.
that
is
correct.
and
the
attempts
at
that
point
at
the
very
most
informal
lever
to
achieve
some
kind
of
an
agreement
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
has
happened
in
the
c,
if
he
cannot
work
it
out
at
that
level
and
a
lot
percentage
of
them
are
worked
out
at
that
level.
if
within
21
days
that
has
not
been
done
then
the
aggrieved
employee
files
a
formal
complaint.
and
at
that
point
there
is
an
investigator
who
is
appointed
to
make
an
investigation.
the
investigator
comes
from
within
the
agency
but
he
cannot
be
under
the
supervision
of
the
person
who
is
alleged
to
have
discriminated.
the
investigation
is
really
the
heart,
initially
of
the
inquiry
into
discrimination.
he
has
full
authority
to
ask
questions,
to
interview.
it
is
not
an
adversary
process;
it
is
an
inquisitorial
process,
and
he
prepares
an
investigation
file
which
is
a
report
of
what
he
has
found.
the
next
step
is
that
an
attempt
at
adjustment
of
the
complaint
is
attempted
on
the
basis
of
that
investigation.
in
the
event
that
an
adjustment
of
the
complaint
can
not
be
achieved,
then
the
complainant
indicates
that
he
wants
a
hearing,
and
that
is
when
the
civil
service
commission
appoints
its
hearing
examiner
and
the
hearing
is
held
within
the
agency.
fortunately
we
have
a
good
record
in
this
case
and
i
would
simply
commend
to
the
court
that
you
might
want
to
read
the
record
of
the
hearing
in
this
case
because
i
think
it
is
an
example
of
how
a
hearing
can
operate.
the
individual
was
entitled
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel,
he
is
not
required
to.
in
this
case,
mrs.
chandler
represented
herself
and
frankly
in
my
opinion
she
did
a
good
job.
there
is
a
representative
of
the
agency
present
as
well.
in
this
case
it
would
appear
that
the
representative
of
the
agency
was
not
a
lawyer
but
in
any
event
he
would
not
take
a
vigorous
adversary
procedure.
the
complaints
examiner
renders
a
recommended
decision
and
makes,
in
effect,
findings
of
fact.
that
is
forwarded
to
the
agency
itself
which
makes
the
decision.
from
that
point
the
complainant
has
two
options:
he
can
either
go
direct
to
court
or
he
can
go
to
--
or
he
can
appeal
to
the
appeals
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission.
and
following
180
days
of
the
filing
either
with
the
civil
service
commission
or
with
the
agency
it
has
the
right
go
into
court.
the
issue,
it
seems
to
us,
is
that
whether
it
is
more
consistent
with
these
overall
civil
service
commission
responsibilities
and
the
fact
of
integration
of
the
adjudication
process
with
a
much
broader
federal
equal
employment
opportunity
effort
to
relegate
the
civil
service
commission
to
the
role
of
an
examiner
or
the
provider,
if
you
will,
of
address
rehearsal.
the
traditional
tandem
of
agency
and
court
in
affecting
congressional
policy
and
in
utilizing
scarce
federal
resources
for
this
purpose,
works
best
when
the
agency
brings
it
expertise
to
bear
on
substantive
policy
matters
integrating
its
broader
rule
making
authority
with
its
adjudicatory
authority.
and
the
court
is
doing
what
they
do
best,
correcting
errors
of
law,
errors
of
procedure,
excesses
of
statutory
power
or
constitutional
right
and
correcting
factual
errors
only
when
they
do
rise
to
their
level
of
excesses
of
substantial
evidence.
and
this,
we
submit,
is
what
congress
must
have
meant
by
integrating
the
complaint
adjudicating
process
as
a
part
of
the
commissions
broader
equal
employment
opportunity
in
federal
and
federal
merit
system
responsibilities.
and
giving
the
commission,
on
parallel,
remedial
powers.
senator
williams
stated
at
the
conclusion
after
all
of
the
amendment
--
at
the
time
that
all
of
the
amendments
were
made,
and
the
senate
committee
report
also
states
early
in
the
legislative
history
that
an
important
adjunct
to
the
strengthened
civil
service
commission
responsibilities
is
the
statutory
provision
of
a
private
right
of
action
or
review
of
the
agency
proceedings.
that
right
of
review
is
senator
williams
language
later
on,
that
right
of
review
language
does
not
appear
in
the
senate
committee
report.
but
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
both
regarded
it
as
an
adjunct
to
the
strengthened
civil
service
commission
responsibilities.
it
is
significant
in
this
regard
that
this
court’s
decision
in
alexander
versus
gardner-denver,
as
i
read
it,
relies
principally
on
the
fact
that
in
the
private,
in
the
arbitration
context
up
until
the
time
that
you
got
into
court,
the
complainant
had
not
had
the
access
to
any
official
body
of
the
federal
government
that
had
either
the
authority
or
the
responsibility
for
implementing
and
for
fleshing
out
the
details
and
implementing
of
equal
employment
opportunity
policy.
the
statement
is
made
a
number
of
ways
in
a
number
of
different
places
in
the
gardner-denver
opinion.
but
the
thrust
is
always
the
same
that
the
responsibility
of
the
arbitrator
is
to
implement
the
contract
whereas
the
responsibility
of
the
civil
service
commission
by
contrast
is
to
implement
the
statute.
the
arbitrator
simply
has
no
responsibility
to
implement
the
federal
policy
contained
in
the
1972
amendments,
by
contrast,
the
civil
service
commission
does
and
that
is
its
principle
responsibility.
now,
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
whether
there
would
be
any
difference
whether
you
appeal
to
the
--
directly
to
the
appeals
--
you
appeal
directly
from
the
agency
or
you
go
through
the
appeals
review
board
and
i
think
it
is
apparent,
and
now
that
my
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
and
the
reason
is
that
under
either
circumstance
it
is,
we
do
have
this
tandem
of
agency
responsibility
and
court
responsibility
with
each
doing
the
kind
of
things
that
they
do
best.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct;
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
am
saying
one
more
thing
and
that
is
that
whether
you
go
directly
from
the
agency
in
to
court,
it
is
a
review
of
the
administrative
record
or
if
you
go
from
the
civil
service
commission
in
to
court,
it
is
a
review
of
the
administrative
record
because
under
either
circumstance
you
have
the
agency
having
brought
its
expertise
to
bear
on
the
problem.
now
to
be
sure,
if
it
is
direct
from
the
agency
it
is
a
shared
responsibility
between
civil
service
commission
and
the
agency
but
it
is
still
that
kind
of
a
tandem
responsibility
between
courts
and
agency.
mr.
selig
has
pointed
out
that
congress
knew
how
to
provide
for
substantial
evidence
review.
that
is
very
correct.
we
also
know
that
congress
knows
how
to
provide
for
de
novo
review
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
this
case
the
language
of
the
statute
does
lend
itself
to
either
interpretation.
there
is
the
language
on
the
one
hand,
the
statement
of
senator
williams
that
clearly
point
to
record
review.
there
is
the
statement
of
senator
dominick
that
might
lend
itself
to
the
other
interpretation.
though
i
would
point
out
that
senator
williams’
statements
in
this
regard
are
more
to
be,
not
trusted
but
are
more
persuasive
in
this
context
than
those
of
senator
dominick,
because
all
of
dominick’s
comments
were
given,
or
virtually
all,
were
given
in
the
context
of
one
who
opposed
a
particular
provision
in
the
statute
and
that
was
cease
and
desist
authority
in
the
eeoc,
whereas
senator
williams
the
man
who
introduced
the
bill
that
eventually
became
the
law.
there
was
no
who
was
more
familiar
with
this
bill
as
it
went
throughout
the
various
steps,
than
senator
williams.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
am
confident
that
there
are
justice
stevens.
the
two
statements
that
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
coming
from
the
beyonce
(ph)
case,
which
was
a
wonder
like
act
review
and
that
one
does
expressly
provide
for
substantial
evidence
as
does
consolo,
and
that
make
the
statement
in
those
cases
dictum.
but
it
is
very
clear
dictum
and
for
that
reason,
i
cannot
give
you
an
example,
but
i
--
this
court
has
declared
in
the
clearest
possible
language
that
that
is
the
general
approach.
and
once
again,
i
find
it
very
persuasive
that
congress
did
say
that
it
regarded
the
right
of
civil
action
as
an
adjunct
to
strengthened
civil
service
commission
procedures.
the
petitioner
find
significant
the
fact
that
in
the
majority
of
the
cases
there
is
no
hearing.
we
consider
this
to
be
neutral
insofar
as
the
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
concerned.
if
there
has
been
no
hearing
it
is
because
the
complainant
has
so
elected
and
has
concluded
in
effect
that
the
investigation
is
sufficient
and
provides
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
record.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
moreover,
if
the
complainant
elects
not
to
have
a
hearing
that
does
not
mean
there
is
none
administrative
record
to
review.
the
administrative
record
for
review
in
those
circumstances
is
the
investigation
file.
similarly,
it
has
been
urged
by
the
amicus
that
the
average
administrative
proceeding
takes
201
days
which
is
longer
than
the
180
days
and
that
in
some
cases
it
is
much
higher,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
advised
by
the
civil
service
commission
that
at
present
the
time
it
is
just
a
little
bit
higher
than
that;
it
is
about
200
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
we
are
talking
about
mr.
chief
justice
is
the
period
of
time
that
it
takes
from
the
filing
of
a
complaint
up
until
the
time
that
the
administrative
record
is
complete.
you
have
180
days
at
the
agency
level
and
you
also
have
180
days
at
the
civil
service
commission
appeals
review
board
in
the
event
that
they
elect
that
option.
and
i
should
also
point
out
that
with
the
proposed
adoption
of
class
action
procedures,
we
are
likely
to
have
other
cases
in
which
the
elapsed
time
is
even
greater.
we
do
not
see
this
as
a
significant
problem
insofar
as
the
present
issue
is
concern
for
this
reason.
in
the
average
case
where
--
be
at
the
201
or
218,
by
the
time
the
court
reaches
the
issue
there
will
be
an
administrative
record,
because
with
180
days
just
in
the
time
that
it
takes
to
file
an
answer,
you
would
be
up
to
the
218
days.
but
let
us
take
the
case
in
which
it
is
not
218
maybe
it
is
300,
it
is
our
view
that
what
the
court
should
do
under
those
circumstances
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
been
talking
about
is
that
court
should
entertain
a
stay
motion
and
should
first
inquire
to
determine
what
the
reason
is
for
the
delay.
if
the
court
finds
that
it
is
for
any
reason
other
than
the
fault
of
the
agency,
the
court
should
then
favorably
entertain
a
stay
motion
and
should
wait
for
the
completion
of
the
administrative
record.
in
the
event
that
the
delay
is
due
to
the
agency’s
fault
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
proceed
with
de
novo
review
or
to
take
other
steps
that
might
--
that
are
within
the
discretion
of
the
reviewing
court.
finally,
the
point
has
or
it
is
also
been
argued
that
there
is
a
problem
insofar
as
the
procedures
are
concerned
with
the
examiner
being
the
only
one
who
has
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
the
--
it
is
a
credibility
problem,
the
demeanor
problem.
in
that
respect
there
are
some
cases
in
which
credibility
and
demeanor
may
occupy
a
large
part
of
the
case.
in
those
instances,
in
those
instances,
if
the
agency
and
the
commission
have
not
followed
the
commissioner,
the
examiner’s
decision,
then
under
the
traditional
rules
of
review
that
were
established
by
this
court
in
the
universal
camera
case,
the
court
can
reverse
on
that
ground
alone
that
inadequate
consideration
was
given
to
what
the
examiner
did,
and
similarly
another
alternative
would
be
simply
to
remand
the
case
for
further
consideration.
in
this
particular
case,
credibility
was
not
a
large
issue.
there
really
--
it
was
not
a
substantial
issue
insofar
as
what
happened,
who
was
telling
the
truth
and
who
was
not.
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
was
whether
it
is
more
important
in
selecting
section
chiefs
to
rely
on
individual
specific
kinds
of
skills
such
as
the
ability
to
read
computer
printouts
and
experience
in
specific
phases
of
the
agency’s
work
or
whether
the
larger
more
subjective
kinds
of
skills
such
as
the
ability
to
motivate
people
are
concerned.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
you
look
carefully
at
what
the
examiner
concluded
with
regard
to
sex,
it
did
not
depend
in
any
way
on
what
the
witnesses
said
on
the
matter
of
credibility,
one
having
said
one
thing
and
one
having
said
another
and
which
was
telling
truth.
she
relied
on
three
considerations
all
of
which
were
judgment
balancing
kinds
of
considerations
which
can
be
done
as
well
by
a
reviewing
body
as
by
the
one
who
has
heard
the
evidence.
in
conclusion
we
submit
that
congress
has
made
a
comprehensive
effort
to
assure
equal
employment
opportunity
in
the
federal
government.
it
is
an
effort
that
consists
of
several
interlocking
components,
including
review
of
equal
opportunity,
employment
opportunity
plans,
training,
upward
mobility,
affirmative
action,
adjudication
of
grievances,
complete
with
full
remedial
authority
that
is
unparalleled
anywhere
is
either
within
government
or
outside.
the
administration
of
this
total
integrated
whole
is
charged
to
the
civil
service
commission
already
preeminent
and
unique
in
its
expertise
and
areas
of
hiring,
training
and
promotions
which
are
the
consistent
touchstones
of
equal
opportunity
issues.
to
wrench
from
this
integrated
whole
one
interlocking
component
would
work
serious
damage
to
the
careful
scheme
intended
by
congress.
for
this
reason
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
true
and
that
mr.
chief
justice
specifically
is
the
problem,
there
are
423,
we
wish
there
were
473
but
there
are
423
of
them.
none
of
whom
is
charged
with
total
unifying
responsibility,
the
only
place
in
the
judicial
system
where
that
kind
of
total
unifying
responsibility
could
possibly
rest
is
right
here
in
this
court.
by
contrast
the
civil
service
commission
does
have
the
total
responsibility.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
surely,
and
that
is
totally
irrelevant
so
far
as
the
present
issue
is
concerned.
in
fact,
it
even
cuts
our
way.
the
fact
is
that
notwithstanding
that
concern,
congress
said
several
things,
one
is
that
notwithstanding
that
concern
the
civil
service
commission,
they
did
choose
the
civil
service
commission
and
in
that
respect
in
order
to
assist
it
yet
the
committee
was
persuaded
that
civil
service
commission’s
sincereness,
dedication
to
principles
of
equal
employment.
in
order
to
assist
the
commission
in
accomplishing
these
goals
to
make
clear
the
congressional
expectation,
it
was
given
responsibilities
to
function
in
developing
a
comprehensive
equal
employment
opportunity
program.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
notwithstanding
those
concerns
which
were
thoroughly
erred
in
congress,
it
was
the
total
responsibility
that
was
clearly
placed
in
the
civil
service
commission.
and
i
do
not
want
to
give
the
impression
that
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
working.
you
look
at
the
statement
by
chairman
hampton.
my
friends
have
indicated
the
performance
of
the
eeoc
with
regard
to
back
pay
awards.
well,
that
is
all
really
that
the
eeoc
can
get
the
through
the
courts
is
back
pay
awards.
but
in
the
federal
sector,
far
more
important
than
back
pay
is
gs
grade,
because
that
relates
not
only
to
money
it
also
relates
to
future
status
and
to
other
employment
considerations
that
are
equally
as
important
as
money.
and
as
that
report
shows
at
the
same
time
that
federal
employment
is
been
going
down,
we
have
had
a
perceptible
improvement
at
all
of
the
gs
levels
insofar
as
minorities
are
concerned.
but
the
principle
point
is
that
whether
it
is
succeeding
or
not.
if
there
are
statutes
--
if
the
commission
has
acted
in
excess
of
its
statutory
responsibility,
then
that
is
a
basis
for
complaint
in
court.
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
courts
do
well.
if
in
fact
they
are
saying
that
congress
made
the
wrong
judgment
in
giving
this
kind
of
responsibility
to
the
civil
service
commission
then
the
remedy
there
is
in
congress.
but
you
cannot
simply,
you
cannot
simply
say
that
--
you
cannot
simply
make
a
subjective
judgment
that
the
civil
service
commission
has
not
been
doing
as
well
as
it
ought
to
do
and
therefore
rejected
the
judgment
that
congress
made
but
this
is
where
the
responsibility
lies.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
in,
generally,
the
review
of
the
record,
the
review
of
the
administrative
record
necessarily
implies,
and
i
think
it
has
been
the
consistent
practice
that
the
court
has
to
have
a
certain
discretion.
now
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
think
that
if
i
am
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
where
the
court
of
appeals
took
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
rather
than
sending
it
back,
you
mean.
no,
i
do
not.
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
quite
as
well
set
up
to
take
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
do
not,
but
i
think
that
it
follows
from
this
kind
of
statutory,
from
this
kind
of
statutory
structure
and
that
it
simply
makes
sense
in
the
discretion
of
--
to
allow
this
kind
of
discretion
in
the
district
court
for
those
two
kinds
of
circumstances.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
may
be.
we
cannot
but
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you.
