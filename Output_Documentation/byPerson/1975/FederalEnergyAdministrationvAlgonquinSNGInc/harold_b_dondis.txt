mr.
harold
b.
dondis
thank
you,
your
honor
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
license
fee
now
before
the
court,
involves
the
broadest
exercise
of
the
tariff
power
in
the
history
of
the
american
republic.
in
fact,
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
as
the
judge
said,
stand
time
to
determine
his
broad
and
executive
power
as
is
claimed
in
this
case.
the
statute
is
a
simple
one.
it
does
not
mention
the
tariff
on
its
face.
it
states,
the
president
can
take
such
action
and
put
such
deemed
time
as
he
deems
necessary
to
adjust
the
imports
of
an
article
and
so
forth
so
that
it
will
not
threaten
to
impair
the
national
security.
i
will
get
back
to
the
exact
wording
and
the
exact
meaning
of
that
statute,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
our
position
that
the
court
should
give
this
a
very
narrow
and
careful
construction
because
in
effect,
the
statute
under
the
interpretation
of
the
government
undermines
the
whole
tariff
structure
of
the
united
states.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
it
was
to
put
on
a
quota
your
honor.
it
was
written
in
the
background
of
complete
discussion
of
the
quote
problem.
it
was
put
in
essentially
for
the
oil
companies
who
worry
about
competition
abroad.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
but
i
will
explain
the
term
the
word
“adjust.”
i
do
not
just
want
to
plunge
into
that
problem.
i
would
like
to
give
you
a
little
bit
of
the
background.
i
certainly
want
to
answer
your
questions
directly.
i
will
say
though
that
the
first
measure
under
the
statute
was
a
voluntary
quota
program.
the
senate
and
congress
as
whole
overwhelmingly
discussed
it
as
a
quota
program
and
it
was
designed
to
protect
the
oil
companies
substantially
because
they
had
great
many
imports
which
was
threatening
prices
in
america.
however,
it
was
extended
to
all
articles.
now,
i
think
you
should
understand
that
since
the
statute
does
not
mention
a
tax
at
all,
that
once
it
is
construed
to
include
the
tax,
there
is
no
limit
on
it
and
that
is
important
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
this
is
a
license
fee
your
honor
which
has
reach
that
reaches
farther,
much
broader
than
a
tariff
and
i
will
explain
why
it
does.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
have
to
accept
the
nomenclature
of
the
government
as
in
licensed
tax,
but
it
has
all
the
instance
of
the
tariff
and
something
more.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
i
will
explain
why
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
tax.
it
is
a
very
minor
point,
but
let
me
try
to
explain
it
now.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
no,
i
do
not
think
you
would
your
honor
because
i
do
not
like
to
argue
that
question,
but
there
is
a
clear
right
of
appeal
under
the
federal
energy
act
in
any
event.
i
do
not
have
that
problem.
the
reason
why
i
think
i
better
answer
that
question.
the
reason
why
it
really
has
a
sweep
far
broader
than
a
tax
is
that
the
money
is
paid
in
the
fund.
they
are
moneys
exacted
on
imports.
so,
in
that
sense
it
is
certainly
a
tariff
and
has
all
the
incidents
and
the
economic
effect
of
a
tariff.
but
the
moneys
are
paid
into
a
fund
and
the
government
allows
exemptions
based
upon
various
parts
of
the
country.
so
that
certain
parts
of
the
county
because
of
these
exemptions
do
not
pay
as
high
a
license
fee
as
others,
the
result
is
that
the
imposition
is
not
uniform
and
it
is
in
violation
of
the
uniformity
clause
of
the
constitution.
now,
i
believe
and
i
can
only
speculate
that
the
government
set
this
up
as
a
license
fee
system
in
order
to
avoid
that
problem.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
no,
i
do
not
think
they
finally
characterizes
it.
i
think
they
accepted
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
on
the
uniformity
provisions?
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
oh
well,
i
simply
say
that
they
--
the
government
has
chosen
the
form
of
the
system
and
i
am
personally
convinced
that
it
was
chosen
to
get
around
the
uniformity
act.
now,
we
could
not
appeal
from
a
tariff
because
that
is
what
the
government
did
not
have.
it
had
what
they
call
a
license
fee
system
which
is
very
comparable
because
that
which
was
invalidated
by
this
court
in
the
catv
and
napco
cases.
all
i
can
say
is
we
can
only
appeal
from
what
they
have
given
us.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
no,
it
is
one
to
demonstrate
that
this
statute
should
be
very
carefully
and
narrowly
construed
and
if
there
is
a
constitutional
question,
then
the
tariff
should
be
construed
as
to
avoid
and
not
allow
a
license
tax
system
at
all.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
well,
i
would
think
it
would
apply
in
the
case
of
a
license
fee
system.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
because
if
a
license
fee
has
all
the
effects
of
a
tariff
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
to
bring
down
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
think
he
could
do
that
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
due
process
clause.
obviously,
he
would
kill
a
lot
of
people
as
he
did
that.
i
think
the
due
process
clause
takes
over
at
some
point.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
no,
we
are
not
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
well,
i
can
only
say
we
are
bringing
before
the
court
a
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
statutes
and
we
say
the
statute
must
be
interpreted
narrowly
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
and
this
program
not
only
provides
the
uniform
treatment
and
this
is
not
what
the
government
has
done.
i
do
not
think
the
government
should
profit
more.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
they
could
hardly
do
that.
they
have
not
set
up
such
a
system.
but
one
aspect
of
the
program
is
that
it
has
unlimited
tax,
there
is
no
limit
in
the
statute
itself.
as
a
result
it
has
become
the
highest
tariff
in
history
and
it
is
--
the
tariff
on
oil
as
many
times
the
very
high
tariff
law
was
established
by
smoot-hawley
act.
now,
another
aspect
of
it
is
that
the
government
used
this
statute
to
abolish
a
tariff
and
this
was
invalidated
by
the
court
of
appeals.
so
the
government
apparently
claims
that
it
includes
the
right
to
abolish
a
tariff
and
mind
you,
this
applies
to
the
entire,
all
articles
that
can
come
into
the
united
states.
the
government
apparently
asserts
that
power
provided
it
makes
the
finding
in
the
national
security.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
pardon.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
but
how
much
difference
your
honor.
the
government
claimed
along
and
it
is
very
hard
to
dispute
that
the
national
security
is
not
something
that
can
be
reviewed
in
this
court.
the
government
claimed
below
it
had
to
provide
no
hearings
on
the
question
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
these
days
of
total
law,
it
is
doubtful
that
there
are
any
commodities
that
would
not
be
within
this
clause.
if
you
look
under
the
trading
of
the
enemy
act,
for
example,
in
the
commerce,
they
have
a
list
of
commodities.
they
have
almost
every
conceivable
commodity
affecting
the
public
interest.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
the
license
fee
is
a
devastating.
we
never
objected
to
the
quota.
the
licensing
–-
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
an
embargo
could
be
put
on.
that
would
be
a
real
due
process
question
because
we
would
not
have
lights
here,
we
will
freeze
to
death.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
the
president
has
the
power
of
quota
and
it
is
a
very
large
reconic
power.
there
is
no
question,
but
i
submit
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
no.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
there
is
no
way
because
the
word
“restrict”
clearly
implies
quotas
and
because
the
statutory
history
again
and
again
refers
to
quotas.
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
was
enacted
under
a
background
of
quotas.
no
doubt,
but
i
suggest
that
one
reconic
power
does
not
imply
another
and
i
also
suggest
your
honors
that
you
have
never
implied
a
tax.
never
in
the
history
of
this
court
from
language
which
does
not
explicitly
provide
for
a
tax
and
here
there
is
no
such
language,
there
is
not
language
that
mentions
a
measure
of
tax
nor
a
method
of
calculation
of
the
tax.
there
is
not
such
thing.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
what
is
that?
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that
the
two
of
them
whether
it
is
a
license
fee
or
a
tariff
they
are
equally
lethal.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
think
it
is
in
violative
of
the
tariff
clause
and
it
is
not
within
the
power
granted
to
congress.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
mean,
i
am
sorry,
the
power
granted
by
congress
obviously.
i
did
not
mean
that.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
if
the
president
has
his
power,
he
does
not
have
to
use
the
elaborate
mechanism
of
title
xix
of
the
u.s.
code
which
involves
all
the
technical
requirements
of
tariffs
and
very
importantly
it
involves
the
recommendation
of
the
international
trade
commission
which
is
a
basic
body
for
governing
tariffs.
in
other
words,
if
you
take
all
the
powers,
taken
together
under
this
statute
as
claimed
by
the
government
that
is
an
unlimited
tariff,
a
power
to
abolish
a
tariff,
of
finding
it
probably
includes
almost
any
article
there
is
in
congress.
no
review
as
a
national
security
provision
completes
a
convention
of
the
tariff
power
then
i
suggest
you
that
the
president
--
the
government
is
right
here
as
a
whole
tariff
power
lock,
stock
and
barrel
and
congress
has
given
it
up
completely
and
i
suggest
further
that
1862
(b)
will
eventually
swallow
the
entire
tariff
structure.
i
admit
it
will
happen
slowly.
here
it
has
been
applied
only
to
oil,
but
i
think
tomorrow
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
i
do.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
do
not
think
they
can
your
honor.
they
try
to
put
a
mark
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
they
try
to
put
on
a
moratorium
on
this
enormous
fee
for
five
months
and
they
could
not
override
a
veto.
i
do
not
think
if
--
for
one
thing
the
very
existence
of
the
tariff
creates
vested
interest
throughout
the
country.
this
immediately,
for
example,
this
tariff
hurt
the
east
very
greatly.
it
would
probably
create
a
vested
interest
in
the
midwest
immediately
and
those
senators
would
not
actually
be
very
loathe
to
override
a
veto.
so
i
think
once
congress
gives
up
the
power,
i
doubt
that
it
can
get
it
back
so
easily
unless
it
makes
some
mammoth
kind
of
deal
with
the
president.
but
it
certainly
was
unable
to
get
this
back
even
though
a
majority
of
congress
and
the
house
disapproved
of
it.
this
is
why
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
this
court
has
never
presumed
a
tax
will
exist
when
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
statute
and
this
would
be
a
precedent
if
it
does
so.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
well,
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
refunded?
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
to
those
who
paid
it.
we
had
a
problem
with
that
in
the
circuit
court.
the
government
wanted
to
refund
very
large
share
of
it
to
the
oil
companies
and
we
made
a
motion
opposing
that
in
the
circuit
court
and
the
government
changed
its
mind.
but
the
government
does
claim
a
right
to
rebate
this
which
is
another
example
of
the
vast
powers
that
they
have.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
do
not
ask
the
court
quite
to
get
to
that
problem.
i
realize
that
it
was
a
schechter
problem.
there
are
no
standards
in
this
act
or
no
really
workable
standards
in
the
act
of
the
term
national
security.
if
you
look
on
the
1862
(c)
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
oh!
that
is
quite
easy.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
that
is
quite
easy
and
there
are
two
reasons.
first,
the
government
had
abolished
the
tariff
and
also
had
put
exemptions
on
the
fees.
so
the
tariff
was
not
being
felt
by
that
time.
the
circuit
court
mentioned
that.
also,
the
congress
in
1974
mentions
specifically
that
it
had
not
gotten
to
the
problem
of
the
oil
tariff.
much
important,
your
honor,
is
the
1962
statute.
look
at
that!
that
specifically
gave
the
government
the
power
which
the
government
now
claims
today.
it
specifically
gave
the
tariff
for
security
reasons
and
that
was
rejected
in
1962
and
senator
byrd
gave
up
a
very
complete
analysis
of
that,
of
the
reasons
why
it
was
rejected.
that
is
a
far
more
important
indication
because
during
the
60s
and
in
1958,
the
protectionists
tried
to
add
the
tariff
power
to
this
section
and
were
unable
to
and
only
in
1970
when
for
the
first
time
after
15
years
the
government,
the
president’s
task
force
reported
that
perhaps
a
tariff
could
be
put
on,
did
congress
attempt
legislation
the
other
way?
it
abandoned
the
1970
legislation
because
president
nixon
promised
not
to
put
one
on.
it
was
not
until
1973
that
he
put
a
mild
one
on
and
a
bite
of
it
as
the
circuit
court
said,
the
bite
of
it
was
not
felt
and
was
not
dealt
with
in
1974.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
they
were
very,
very
minor
as
originally
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
in
principle,
they
are
the
same,
but
i
would
for
example
point
to
my
own
experience.
we
were
readying
a
suit
to
question
that,
but
we
are
doing
it
very
leisurely.
it
was
not
a
great
threat
and
i
think
many
members,
representatives
indicated,
he
did
not
even
know
it
was
on
during
one
of
the
hearings.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
think
they
were
generally
aware
and
not
greatly
considering
about
the
whole
problem.
they
had
had
no
bite
whatsoever
by
that
time
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
well,
it
happened
very
suddenly
in
the
early
1974
and
congress
was
very
shocked
by
it.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
am
sorry.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
do
not
think
congress
was
aware
of
it.
i
am
not
going
to
have
much
time
to
answer
all
the
position
by
the
government.
i
would
like
to
address
the
word
“such
action
as
he
deems
necessary.”
i
do
not
think
that
is
an
utterly
expansive
power.
the
government
takes
a
different
position
in
its
brief
than
the
solicitor
general
has
taken
here.
the
term
“such
action
as
he
deems
necessary”
is
very
common
words
in
statutes.
they
do
not
mean
that
they
expand
the
power,
the
basic
power
given
in
the
statute.
all
they
mean
is
that
the
president
or
the
legislative
official
can
take
such
measures
as
he
deems
necessary
in
order
to
use
the
basic
power.
for
example,
federal
power
act
has
a
separate
section
which
says
a
commission
shall
have
power
to
perform
any
in
all
acts
necessary
or
appropriate
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
this
act.
and
in
the
napco
case,
in
which
your
honors,
in
a
unanimous
decision
invalidated
the
license
fee.
that
general
power
was
present
and
the
circuit
court
said
that
that
did
not
expand
the
powers.
now,
the
government
takes
the
broadest
possible,
let
me
say,
i
need
the
government’s
brief,
they
take
the
possible,
the
broadest
possible
decision.
they
say
the
present
trends
of
choice
with
respect
to
the
corrective
actions
that
he
make,
may
take
under
the
provision
is
subject
to
only
one
limitation.
the
president
must
deem
the
action
to
be
necessary
to
accomplish
the
prescribed
objective
adjusting
the
imports
of
the
article
to
eliminate
the
threat
to
the
national
security.
the
statute
does
not
otherwise
limit
in
any
way
the
nature
of
the
action
that
the
persons
may
take.
now,
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
backed
down
from
that
position
as
obviously
he
must.
for
example
the
president
would
not
be
allowed
to
use
subsidies
to
adjust
imports.
he
certainly
could
not
put
on
a
depletion
allowance.
under
this
–-
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
think
you
have
to
decide
--
well,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
your
honor
is
that
this
general
clause
does
not
mean
much
such
action
as
he
deems
necessary.
the
solicitor
general
admits
that
that
just
cannot
be
true.
otherwise
the
president
could
occupy
saudi
arabia
for
that
purpose.
the
important
part
of
the
statute
is
the
word
“adjust.”
the
statute
says
the
president
can
take
such
actions
as
he
deems
necessary
to
adjust
the
imports
of
an
article.
now,
that
word
“adjust”
is
a
very
specific
word
used
throughout
the
code
and
i
have
looked
hi
and
lo
through
the
code,
i
can
find
no
use
of
the
word
adjust
that
means
an
indirect
adjustment
of
the
type
that
the
government
contends
for.
it
usually
means
a
kind
of
a
manual,
exact
and
precise
change.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
below
said
it
meant
withdrawal
of
goods
from
the
warehouse.
now,
the
government
has
produced
no
statute
in
which
the
term
adjust
refers
to
an
indirect,
uncertain
amount
of
change
in
imports
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
it
means.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
i
think
it
is
a
change,
but
i
do
not
call
it
an
adjustment
because
the
word
“adjust”
is
a
verb
and
i
think
it
implies
something
definite
and
certain.
now,
for
example
in
this
case,
on
the
first
year
imports,
the
president
did
not
indicate
whether
they
would
change
imports
at
all
and
within
a
few
months
have
they
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
a
very
uncertain
impact.
for
example,
in
this
situation--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
uncertain
as
to
amount
and
even
in
some
situation
as
to
whether
have
any
impact
at
all.
in
this
situation,
it
had
not
impact.
the
imports
went
up
during
the
period
of
this
fee.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
that
is
right.
absolutely
inelastic
and
furthermore,
my
time
is
up,
but
furthermore
the
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
in
this
situation
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
that
is
right.
it
was
to
raise
the
domestic
price
so
that
consumption
of
all
oil
in
america
would
go
down
and
incidentally
the
foreign
consumption
would
go
down.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
yes,
but
it
is
the
most
indirect
method.
this
is
not
what
i
call
an
adjustment
of
imports.
he
can
do
the
same
thing
by
rationing
gasoline
in
u.s.
or
he
could
have
put
a
used
tax
on
oil
in
the
u.s.
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
not
under
this
statute
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
harold
b.
dondis
thank
you
your
honor.
