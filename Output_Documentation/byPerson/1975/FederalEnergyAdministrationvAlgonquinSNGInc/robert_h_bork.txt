mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
that
court
with
one
judge
dissenting,
reversed
the
district
court's
determination
that
section
232
(b)
of
the
trade
expansion
act
of
1962
empowers
the
president
in
certain
cases
to
use
the
system
of
license
fees
to
control
or
to
adjust
the
imports
of
oil
and
other
commodities
into
this
country.
the
reasoning
of
the
majority
of
the
panel
was
that
section
232
(b)
is
a
delegation
by
congress
to
the
president
of
the
power
only
to
impose
quotas,
but
not
to
license
fees.
hence,
the
court
upheld
the
contentions
of
the
respondents
that
the
fees
at
issue
here
are
without
warrant
of
the
law.
before
coming
to
the
merits
of
that
discussion,
i
will
just
briefly
as
requested
by
the
court,
the
question
of
whether
these
suits
are
barred
by
the
anti-injunction
act,
neither
we
nor
the
respondents
believe
that
they
are
so
barred.
our
position
is
simply
that
anti-injunction
act
applies
only
with
respect
to
taxes
imposed
by
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
and
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
we
think
that
both
that
the
taxes
are
in
the
legislative
history,
support
that
view.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
discussed
below
justice
blackmun,
but
it
was
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
is
no
about
disagreement
about
it,
but
we
request
it
was
discussed
by
the
court.
the
anti-injunction
act
is
in
the
1954
code
and
it
is
contained
in
chapter
76
of
subtitle
(f)
which
is
now
--
section
7851
of
that
code
which
is
quoted
at
page
20,
footnote
13
of
our
brief,
our
main
brief,
provides
that
subtitle
(f)
which
includes
the
anti-injunction
act
applies
to
any
tax
imposed
by
this
title
and
of
course
the
fees
at
issue
here
are
not
imposed
by
that
title.
there
is
says,
the
subtitle
(f)
does
not
apply
to
taxes
imposed
under
the
1939
code
except
as
subsections
(b)
and
(c)
provide
and
subsection
(c)
provides,
in
fact
that
chapter
76
of
subtitle
(f)
applies
to
the
39
code
and
that
carries
with
the
anti-injunction
act.
so,
i
think
the
clear
implication
is
that
the
anti-injunction
act
applies
outside
the
54
code
only
when
specifically
made
applicable
and
it
is
specifically
made
applicable
only
to
the
1939
code.
hence
we
think
it
is
not
applicable
of
the
fees
here,
whichever
else
they
are,
certainly
note
taxes
imposed
by
the
1954
code
of
the
1939
code.
respondents
have
made
additional
arguments
in
this
direction
in
their
brief
and
we
can
accept
one
of
them
and
we
prefer
not
to
accept
the
other.
their
first
argument
is
that
these
fees
are
not
taxes
and
hence
do
not
fall
under
the
anti-injunction
act.
that
argument
is
in
some
attention
with
their
argument
later
on
in
the
brief
that
they
are
taxes
and
cannot
be
delegated,
but
in
any
event,
we
agree
that
they
are
not
taxes
and
do
not
fall
under
the
anti-injunction
act
for
that
reason.
the
other
argument
is
that
the
anti-injunction
act
would
not
apply
to
a
petition
for
review
fea
regulations
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
court
of
appeals'
jurisdiction
for
that
purpose
is
given
by
the
fea
act.
however,
the
repeal
of
the
statute
in
a
policy
is
so
basic
as
that
expressed
in
the
anti-injunction
act
that
i
think
are
going
to
be
expressed
and
there
are
certainly
no
intimation
that
those
are
to
repeal
the
anti-injunction
act
in
the
fea
act.
so
that
i
think
that
argument
is
incorrect,
but
the
other
two
i
think
are
correct
in
support
of
the
notion
that
there
is
no
application
of
the
anti-injunction
act
here.
with
that
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
if
i
may
and
discussed
directly
the
president’s
power
under
section
232
(b)
to
impose
license
fees
for
the
importation
of
foreign
oil
and
perhaps
i
should
say
a
word
about
why
the
president
shifted
from
the
imposition
of
quotas
to
the
use
of
license
fees.
quotas
have
been
used
for
some
time
in
this
field
and
had
been
found
rather
unsatisfactory
for
one
thing
there
are
quite
rigid.
they
specify
particular
amounts
and
as
demand
changes,
domestic
demand
changes,
they
provide
much
too
much
protection
for
the
domestic
industry
or
much
too
little
protection
to
domestic
industry
and
it
becomes
an
administrative
nightmare
constantly
adjusting
the
size
of
a
quarter,
whereas
a
fee
sets
the
margin
of
encouragement
you
wish
to
give
to
domestic
industry,
in
this
case
for
national
security
purposes,
and
as
domestic
demand
changes,
imports
increase
or
decrease,
but
the
margin
remains
there
and
you
are
given
the
amount
of
protection
you
desire.
well,
section
232
(b)
states
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
must
advise
the
president
when
he
so
finds
that
an
article
is
being
imported
in
such
quantities
or
in
the
said
circumstances
as
to
threaten
to
impair
the
national
security
and
the
president
unless
he
disagrees,
shall
take
such
action
and
for
such
time
as
he
deems
necessary
to
adjust
the
imports
of
such
article
and
its
derivatives,
so
that
such
import
will
not
threaten
to
impair
the
national
security.
here
the
finding
was
made
by
the
secretary
of
state
concerning
oil
and
petroleum
products.
i
should
state
in
passing
perhaps
that
this
section
of
the
statute
has
never
been
used
in
its
history
for
any
commodity
other
than
oil.
here
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
made
that
finding,
the
president
agreed
and
he
placed
license
fees
on
importation
of
oil
to
lessen
the
amounts
in
which
it
was
imported.
now,
i
take
it
that
respondent
do
not
challenge
the
finding
that
there
was
a
threat
to
national
security
and
indeed
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
they
agreed
that
there
was?
so
all
we
are
talking
about
is
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
i
read
the
respondents
in
the
court
of
appeals
read
it
as
if
it
said
the
president
shall
take
such
action
as
he
deems
necessary
to
adjust
the
imports
provided
that
the
only
action
he
shall
deem
necessary
as
quotas.
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says.
if
it
were
a
quota
statute
only
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
write
it
that
way.
many
delegations
of
power
in
this
field
are
written
as
quotas.
this
is
deliberately
given
very
broad
application,
such
action
as
he
deemed
necessary.
so
the
plain
text
of
the
statute
supports
the
president’s
power
to
use
license
fees.
they
are
certainly
without
doubt
a
means
of
adjusting
imports.
they
have
been
used
in
the
history
of
this
republic
from
the
beginning,
monetary
exactions
have
been
used
from
the
beginning
as
a
means
of
adjusting
imports.
now,
we
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
defined
and
it
bears
out
that
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
rather
clearly
and
i
think
no
other
conclusions
is
really
possible.
this
national
security
provision
appeared
in
this
present
form
in
the
trade
agreements
extension
act
of
1955.
the
senate
committee
on
finance
had
before
them
number
of
proposals
to
control
imports
of
various
kinds
of
products.
oil
was
certainly
by
no
means
the
only
kind
of
product
that
was
considered.
there
was
zinc
and
lead,
and
fluorspar
and
so
forth.
now,
one
of
these
amendments
that
was
before
them
was
by
senator
neely
which
provided
for
a
quota
system
on
oils
in
section
1
and
provided
for
a
general
power
to
take
such
action
with
respect
to
any
products
he
thought
necessary
in
section
2.
this
was
replaced,
the
neely
amendment
was
replaced
by
what
we
have
here
which
was
then
the
byrd-millikin
amendment.
now,
that
was
a
compromise
of
all
these
raised
proposals,
some
of
them
are
giving
broad
power,
some
are
requiring
quotas,
some
of
them
applying
to
different
products
by
name
and
the
byrd-millikin
amendment
is
quite
broad
in
the
sense
and
it
simply
says
when
there
is
a
finding
by
the
director
of
the
defense
mobilization
about
effective
imports
on
national
security
being
threatening,
the
president
is
given
powers
to
take
such
actions
as
it
is
deemed
necessary.
so
as
to
all
products
they
adapted
the
second
section
of
the
neely
amendment
as
a
compromise
in
this
byrd-millikin
amendment,
adapted
the
same
form
of
approach.
now,
the
significance
of
that
is
when
you
realize
that
the
byrd-millikin
amendment
in
this
respect
is
identical
to
the
approach
of
the
neely
amendment
is
that
senator
martin,
who
was
a
co-sponsor
of
neely
said
that
during
the
hearing
that
neely
gave
the
president
the
power
to
take
such
action
as
is
necessary
and
that
included
the
power
to
impose
import
quotas
or
to
increase
duties.
now,
by
a
common
utilitarian
proposition,
if
the
neely
amendment
gave
that
power
in
the
byrd-millikin,
it
is
the
same
as
the
millikin
amendment,
then
the
byrd-millikin
amendment
which
we
have
before
us
now
in
the
form
of
232
(b)
gives
that
power
to
use
monetary
exactions,
but
there
is
more
evidence.
in
the
floor
debate,
senator
millikin
stated
that
his
amendment
gave
the
president
the
power
not
only
to
use
quotas,
but
also
to
use
tariffs
and
import
taxes.
senator
barkley
who
was
a
member
of
the
finance
committee
said
the
power
is
to
use
quotas
or
to
take
such
other
steps
as
the
president
deemed
desirable,
he
clearly
thought
there
was
something
other
than
quotas
that
could
be
used.
senator
bennett
said
the
power
included
tariffs,
quotas
and
stockpiling.
senator
byrd
in
the
colloquy
with
senator
saltonstall
which
the
court
of
appeals
misinterpreted
said
the
amendment
put
other
commodities
on
the
same
basis
as
agricultural
commodities
were
already
on.
now,
senator
byrd
have
just
been
discussing
with
senator
thye
the
president’s
power
under
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
to
use
duties
as
well
as
quotas
to
affect
the
size
of
imports.
now,
respondents
reply
in
their
brief
as
i
understand
it
is
that
in
the
discussion
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act,
senator
byrd
referred
to
the
use
of
quotas.
i
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
that
because
the
act
does
provide
for
the
use
of
duties
for
use
of
monetary
exactions.
unless
the
respondents
are
suggesting
that
senator
byrd
did
not
understand
the
agricultural
adjustment
act,
and
therefore,
his
misunderstanding
of
that
act
must
be
carried
over
into
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
but
there
is
really
no
basis
in
the
floor
debate
to
say
that
senator
byrd
displayed
a
misunderstanding
of
the
agricultural
adjustment
act,
it
is
an
odd
thing
to
attribute
to
him.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
unlike
this,
but
that
is
right.
that
is
why
i
think
it
is
interesting
that
he
was
saying
we
now
put
these
on
the
same
basis
as
agricultural
products.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
really
claim
that
he
may
do
anything
he
may
deem
necessary.
i
think
the
meaning
of
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
steps
that
he
deems
necessary,
but
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
are
talking
about
an
area
in
which
he
may
deem
things
necessary.
after
all
this
is
in
title
xix
about
customs
and
so
forth
and
now
the
respondents
here
have
suggested
that
he
can
close
filling
stations
or
he
can
declare,
if
you
read
it
literally,
he
can
declare
daylight
saving
time
the
year
around
or
that
he
can
repeal
internal
revenue
acts
that
apply
to
oil
producers
in
this
country
and
so
forth.
i
think
all
of
that
is,
well,
i
understand
the
motivation
for
that
kind
of
liberal
reading,
but
it
just
does
not
square
with
the
legislative
history
or
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
or
whether
it
is
placed
in
title
xix,
i
think
we
are
effectively
talking
about
the
use
of
monetary
exactions
or
quotas.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
is
broader
authority
in
general
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
which
is
discussed
at
page
51
of
our
opening
brief.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
during
time
of
war
or
declared
national
emergency
which
he
can
declare
i
suppose,
directs
plenty
of
control
over
properties,
etcetera,
it
is
just
not
bad
as
almost
without
standards
whereas
i
think
this
statute
does
have
standards,
it
does
have
criteria.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
some
subsection
c,
there
are
a
list
of
topics
that
the
president
should
consider
in
making
the
decision.
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
have
that
kind
of
guidance
for
the
president
and
in
that
sense
it
is
a
less
confined
delegation
of
power.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
it
could
easily
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
suggest
mr.
justice
marshall,
of
course
they
did
mention
the
possibility
of
stockpiling
and
there
may
be
other
restrictive
actions.
you
see
the
statute
says,
for
example,
when
goods
are
imported
in
such
amounts
or
under
circumstances.
now,
i
suppose
if
it
was
not
a
question
of
amounts,
but
a
question
of
the
circumstances,
perhaps
there
is
dumping
occurring
of
foreign
products
in
one
part
of
the
country,
perhaps
the
president
could
use
an
anti-discrimination
measure
against
--
if
national
security
was
affected.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
did
not
mean
to
do
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
meant
to
say
that
i
think
it
is
limited
to
things
the
president
does
acting
on
imports
rather
than
some
domestic
action
he
might
take
like
repealing
the
income
tax
laws
which
would
affect
the
level
of
imports
obviously.
but
i
think
it
is
an
extravagant
and
amusing
suggestion.
no
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
only
tax
quota.
there
are
ranges
of
other
restrictions
that
they
were
allowing
him,
of
course
they
act
on
imports.
now,
we
have
discussed
on
our
brief,
congressman
cooper
discussed
this
in
the
house,
nothing
to
the
contrary
was
said
in
the
debates.
the
respondents
keep
stressing
the
fact
that
they
can
find
a
man
who
were
not
talking
about
this
only
use
the
word
“quota.”
they
never
find
anybody
who
says
it
is
restricted
to
quotas.
it
is
limited
to
quotas.
there
is
no
power
to
impose
duties.
they
just
found
the
use
of
quota.
we
have
a
number
of
examples
in
which
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
people
are
talking
about
monetary
exactions
as
well
as
quotas.
now
in
1958,
the
office
of
defense
mobilization
submitted
a
report
to
as
sub-committee
of
the
house,
ways
and
means
committee
which
committee
is
in
charge
of
this
matter
and
that
report
explicitly
stated
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
indicated
that
president
was
authorized
to
impose
new
or
increased
tariff
duties
or
quotas
and
after
that
report
was
submitted,
this
very
provision
was
reenacted
in
the
trade
act
of
that
year.
now,
it
was
again
reenacted
in
section
232
(b)
this
time
of
the
trade
expansion
act
of
1962
where
it
is
currently
located
and
in
1970,
this
house
voted
to
amend
that
statute
to
take
away
the
president’s
power
to
impose
duties,
fees,
or
charges
and
that
memo
was
deleted
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
was
not
enacted.
and
finally
i
think
the
cabinet,
in
1973
the
president
used
the
fee
power
on
oil,
that
this
unsuccessful
1973
amendment
would
have
denied
him
and
after
the
exertion
of
that
power
under
section
232
(b),
congress
went
ahead
and
reenacted
it
in
the
trade
act
of
1974.
so
i
found
it
almost
incredible
to
think
that
congress
did
not
know
that
it
was
enacting
a
power
which
on
its
face
gave
the
power
to
impose
license
fees
and
which
they
have
been
told,
involved
tariffs
or
duties
or
fees
which
the
president
had
exercised
before
they
reenacted
it.
i
think
there
can
hardly
be
a
clear
demonstration.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
this
statute
should
not
be
read
broadly
because,
although
it
was
written
broadly,
that
was
odd
because
other
statutes
were
written
narrowly.
i
think
it
is
a
very
odd
mode
of
statutory
construction
to
say
that
a
broad
statute
must
be
narrowed
because
look
there
are
narrow
statutes
all
around
it.
i
think
the
comparison
indicates
that
when
they
wrote
a
broad
statute,
they
meant
to
write
a
broad
statute.
in
any
case,
as
i
have
just
pointed
out
to
you
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
other
statutes
that
are
quite
broad.
this
trading
with
the
enemy
act
is
broader.
now,
at
the
end
i
want
to
come
to
two
of
respondent’s
arguments.
i
think
they
tend
to
raise
two
arguments
of
constitutional
dimension
which
do
not,
first
of
which
they
suggest
would
affect
the
way
in
which
we
read
the
statute.
they
do
not
suggest
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
but
they
suggest
we
alter
its
meaning
in
order
to
avoid
deciding
whether
it
is
unconstitutional
and
i
think
there
are
fatal
defects
on
that
suggestion.
the
suggestion
is
that
this
unconstitutional
delegation
to
the
president
of
congressional
power
and
in
order
to
avoid
that
we
read
it
the
way
they
want
to
read
it.
the
odd
thing
about
that
is
that
if
it
were
too
broad
a
delegation
of
legislative
power,
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
respondents
think
that
quotas
remain
valid,
although
fees
do
not,
but
they
attempt
to
salvage
that
point
by
saying
the
quotas
are
laid
under
the
commerce
power
while
these
license
fees
are
laid
under
the
taxing
power
and
that
for
reasons
which
are
not
disclosed
and
are
certainly
not
obvious
the
tax
delegation
doctrine
is
much
more
stringent
when
applied
to
a
delegation
of
taxing
power.
i
do
not
think
this
is
by
the
way
a
delegation
of
the
taxing
power.
i
think
this
is
a
commerce
power.
it
is
common
to
use
monetary
exactions
as
modes
of
regulation
under
the
commerce
power.
it
is
not
necessary.
this
is
in
light
of
the
taxing
power.
now,
as
i
have
mentioned
before,
of
course
when
they
argue
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
ordinary
tariff,
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
the
power
of
tax,
but
in
common
parlance
it
is
called
taxes
under
commerce
power
to
regulate
in
the
past.
in
any
event
when
arguing
as
i
said
under
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
confess
that
there
is
a
case
in
the
30s
that
may
be
in
the
bottom,
i
am
not
sure,
i
have
to
find
that
out.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well.
well
we
have
some
in
the
brief.
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
yes
and
i
wish
it
had
not
slipped
my
mind
because
it
is
a
commerce
case
in
the
20s
or
30s.
i
will
try
to
think
of
it
as
i
go
along
here
when
we
get
back
up
in
which
at
that
point
was
addressed
in
the
courts
that
there
is
no
reason
you
cannot
use
monetary
exactions
through
the
commerce
power.
but
here,
respondents
are
saying
that
although
this
thing
is
not
a
tax
under
the
anti-injunction
act,
is
it
a
tax
when
we
get
to
delegation
doctrine.
they
have
a
concept
of
tax
which
is
kind
of
accordion
like
and
it
collapses
and
unfolds
according
to
current
needs
of
the
analysis.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
tax,
but
i
do
not
think
it
matters.
worse
than
that
i
think
respondent’s
argument
is
in
consistent
in
terms
of
constitutional
policy.
look
at
that
brief,
at
page
34,
note
44,
they
give
us
the
reason
why
delegation
doctrine
applies
more
stringently
when
taxes
are
involved.
the
reason
turns
out
to
be
chief
justice
marshall’s
statement
of
the
power
to
tax
involves
the
power
to
destroy,
and
therefore,
we
have
to
control
this
thing
much
more
carefully,
but
then
it
is
too
bad
they
put
it
that
was
because
at
page
26,
note
30,
they
are
arguing
a
different
point
and
there
they
say
that
232
(b)
is
the
very
statute,
although
it
gives
no
power
to
tax
which
is
too
dangerous
for
the
president
to
have,
it
does
give
him
the
power
to
place
a
complete
embargo
and
destroy
the
commerce.
now,
they
say
the
power
to
destroy
does
not
imply
the
power
to
tax.
now,
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
argument
runs
something
like
this.
the
president
cannot
have
the
power
to
tax
because
it
involves
the
power
to
destroy,
but
he
already
has
the
power
to
destroy
and
that
is
why
he
cannot
have
the
power
to
tax.
now,
the
dominant
characteristic
of
that
position
i
think
is
kind
of
in
coherence.
there
is
really
no
reason
rooted
in
constitutional
policy
why
delegation
doctrine
should
be
applied
more
stringently
to
an
import
fee
than
to
the
power
to
embark
or
set
a
quota
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
that
this
court
held
in
hampton
&
co.
against
united
states,
and
held
unanimously
that
there
is
no
distinction.
it
was
there
argued,
but
the
delegation
of
the
president
to
raise
import
duties
is
unconstitutional
although
other
kinds
of
delegation
would
not
be
and
mr.
chief
justice
tuff
and
the
unanimous
court
said
there
was
no
such
distinction
between
delegations
under
the
commerce
power
and
those
under
the
power
to
levy
taxes
and
fix
custom
duties.
in
the
second
place,
as
i
have
mentioned,
these
things
are
laid
under
the
commerce
power
and
not
the
power
to
tax
and
finally
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
delegation
doctrine
issue
in
this
case
and
the
suggestion
that
we
avoid
problems
of
delegation
doctrine
by
reading
a
statute
contrary
to
its
intent
in
this
language
is
therefore
a
device
that
we
need
not
resort
to.
the
delegation
doctrine
cases
which
stuck
down
statutes,
the
panama
refining
case
and
the
schechter
poultry
case,
even
if
we
assume
that
they
have
not
been
undercut
and
certainly
a
case
like
southwestern
cable
case
suggest
that
they
have
been
funk
in
at
least
in
some
dimension,
but
even
if
we
assume
they
have
not
been
undercut
and
still
stand
as
perfectly
good
law,
they
are
not
applicable
here.
one
can
just
compare
the
statutes.
in
panama
refining
section
9
(c)
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
gave
the
president
completely
unguided
discretion
whether
or
not
to
make
it
criminal,
the
interstate
shipment
of
hot
oil.
unlike
the
statute
before
is
now;
congress
provided
no
criteria
whatever
for
whether
or
not
he
should
make
it
criminal
required
no
findings
as
a
predicate
to
his
action
and
declared
no
policy.
the
president
was
not
only
unfettered,
he
was
completely
unguided.
now,
in
schechter
poultry,
section
3
of
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
authorized
the
president
to
impose
codes
of
fair
competition
on
industries.
but
when
we
look
at
the
statutes,
the
power
was
to
regulate
industry
and
always
all
together
had
nothing
to
do
with
competition
or
fair
competition.
there
was
no
policy
guidance
and
in
fact
all
that
congress
had
done
with
him
to
the
president
is
commerce
power
and
left
him
to
legislate
it
at
will.
nothing
of
that
sort
has
happened
here,
not
remotely.
the
congress
here
provides
criteria
for
the
president.
they
provide
criteria
which
are
as
definite
as
the
subject
matter
admits
them.
the
fact
as
i
say
are
listed
in
232
(c)
and
here
unlike
those
cases,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
required
to
make
a
study
and
a
finding
prior
to
the
president’s
decision.
now,
i
discussed
already
the
fact
that
the
respondents
try
to
make
this
case
sound
like
schechter
by
talking
about
the
various
things
that
the
president
might
and
i
think
i
have
adequately
suggested
why
the
legislative
history
and
the
placement
of
the
statute
confine
it,
so
there
is
not
anything
like
schechter.
i
have
no
time
to
discuss
their
final
constitutional
argument
which
is
the
uniformity
requirement
as
to
duties.
you
will
find
substantive
arguments
as
to
that
and
are
included
in
our
brief.
i
would
suggest
here
only
that
the
issue
is
not
really
properly
before
the
court
because
it
is
not
alternative
means,
an
alternative
ground
for
sustaining
the
judgment
below.
the
judgment
below
really
requires
the
district
court
to
hold
that
no
fees
at
all
may
be
exacted.
this
theory
would
support
a
judgment
which
eliminated
the
exemptions
from
the
fees
which
introduced
the
uniformity,
but
we
could
exact
fees.
so
a
different
judgment
would
be
required
and
for
that
reason
i
think
that
argument
is
not
proper
before
the
court
at
this
time.
in
short,
what
we
have
here
is
an
energy
crisis
that
endangers
the
national
security.
we
have
an
energy
crisis
which
congress
foresaw
and
provided
for
quite
deliberately
and
repeatedly
delegated
the
president
the
power
to
cope
with
this
threat
by
unlimited
means.
the
president
responded,
and
i
suggest
neither
the
court
of
appeals
reasoning
nor
the
argument
of
respondents
here
withstand
analysis
nor
provide
any
reason
to
take
this
delegated
power
away
from
the
president
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
just
a
few
matters
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
the
first
place
that
the
tariff
on
oil
is
in
effect
in
this
case
involves
in
no
way
the
assertion
of
the
power
to
remove
any
tariff.
the
tariff
laws
are
not
at
stake
in
this
case.
secondly,
in
reply
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
powell,
we
discussed
the
1962
unsuccessful
amendment
tool
in
this
law
which
would
have
given
the
president
explicit
power
to
lay
duties
and
impose
quotas.
the
reason
that
was
not
passed
because
it
was
not
like
this
statute.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
not
a
national
security
statute.
the
president
was
empowered
to
do
anything
when
the
national
interest
was
involved,
a
much
broader
statute
and
furthermore,
there
were
no
criteria
in
the
statute
for
when
he
should
any
of
these
things.
if
there
was
a
statute
like
schechter,
the
nira
in
any
sense
it
was
that
statute
and
that
was
why
it
was
rejected
by
the
congress.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
fees
mr.
justice
white
was
to
have
a
method
of
providing,
cutting
down
foreign
imports
and
developing
american
production
which
would
provide
a
known
market.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was
to
limit
imports
to
decrease
american
dependence
for
the
national
security
reasons
on
foreign
oil.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
and
to
achieve
something
resembling
enough
independence
so
that
the
national
security
purpose
of
the
nation
would
not
be
absolutely
dependent
upon
foreign
oil.
but
mr.
justice
stevens
i
was
asked
about
the
question
of
whether
one
of
the
uses
of
monetary
exactions
and
regulation
of
the
commerce
power,
i
was
not
sufficiently
prepared
for
that,
but
apparently
the
answer
is
rather
board
of
trustees,
the
university
of
illinois
against
united
states
289
u.s.
48
which
this
case
lays
that
doctrine
that
because
the
taxing
power
is
a
distinct
power.
it
does
not
follow
the
duties.
it
may
not
be
imposed
in
the
exercise
of
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
the
contrary
is
well
established
in
gibbons
against
ogden.
so,
i
think
it
is
–
that
is
all
i
wish
to
say.
