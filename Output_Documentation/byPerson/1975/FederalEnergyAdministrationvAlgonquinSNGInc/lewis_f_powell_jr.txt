justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
your
discussion
of
what
might
happen
in
congress?
if
the
congress
had
expressly
authorized
the
imposition
of
these
fees,
are
you
arguing
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
we
get
to
standards,
i
am
interested
in
the
power
of
congress
and
what
do
you
think
congress
has
intended
here?
how
do
you
interpret
the
failure
of
congress
in
1974
when
this
language
was
re-enacted
just
a
year
after
the
president
had
imposed
fees?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
bearing
upon
your
argument?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
do
you
draw
any
distinction
in
principle
between
the
fees
imposed
in
1973
and
those
imposed
in
1975?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
from
principle,
is
that
the
same?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
not
think
the
congress
was
aware
that
these
1973
fees
were
in
effect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
do
you
think
the
congress
had
been
aware
that
the
president
would
have
set
the
power
perhaps
the
increase
amount
of
the
fee?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
just
think
the
congress
really
did
not
know
what
it
was
doing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
the
question
is
not
very
helpful,
you
can
forget
it.[laughter]
