we
will
hear
arguments
in
75-382,
federal
emergency
administration
against
algonquin.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
in
understood
this
act
is
much
broader,
that
is
powers
of
the
president
are
much
broader
that
he
may
do
anything
he
deems
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
been
used
in
some
such
language,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
suggest
any
statutes
giving
executive
powers
that
are
in
any
broader
language
than
this
to
take
such
action
as
he
deems
necessary
and
do
we
have
other
statutes
that
are
broader
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
comes
generally
under
the
emergency
type
of
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
you.
thus,
there
is
no
debate
on
that
any
longer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
answers
of
some
members
of
the
court
were
concerned
about
it
and
want
to
do
hear
and
they
are
not
heard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
make
your
own
election
and
see
if
any
questions
will
prolong
your
argument
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
questions
mr.
attorney
general,
or
you
may
either
argue
the
other
points
or
you
may
delegate
and
assign
that
time
to
your
colleague.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dondis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
was
the
objective
of
congress
in
this
particular
section?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
adjust
and
regulate
imports,
is
that
not
the
objective?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
you
may
find
yourself
under
the
anti-injunction
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
cite
anymore
here
than
whether
he
has
exercised
here,
the
power
is
valid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
congress
did
not
do
it.
the
president
said,
you
gave
him
power
in
broad
language.
he
could
have
rationed
gas
probably,
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
several
other
things,
but
he
elected
to
do
this
one.
now,
your
time
is
up
mr.
dondis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
