so
always
there
were
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
rules
of
that
delegation
with
respect
to
tax.
those
rules
would
not
apply
because
this
is
not
a
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
position
that
this
is
a
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
a
tax
so
to
speak?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
quite
a
difference,
does
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
makes
some
difference
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
hurt
client
the
most,
an
embargo
or
just
license
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
embargo?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe,
but
what
about
under
the
statute,
would
the
president
have
the
power
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wonder
if
you
want
to
narrow
construction
whether
you
want
to
construe
it
narrowly
to
exclude
quotas?
justice
byron
r.
white
narrowly
to
exclude
license
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
i
suppose
that
this
is
just
a
question
of
statutory
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
whichever
way
we
decided
in
a
way
that
congress
does
not
prove,
they
can
pretty
quickly
change
the
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
have
the
power,
you
think
as
a
matter
of
politics
they
could
not,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
purpose
of
the
fee
may
have
been
to
raise
the
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
that
the
domestic
price
of
oil
would
encourage
domestic
production?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
probably
have
said
in
your
brief
or
in
your
argument
and
i
thought
that,
what
do
you
think
is
the
basic
purpose
of
the
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
main
purpose
as
to
when
--
certainly
to
whatever
impact
it
might
have
had
to
limit
imports
that
was
part
of
the
purpose,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
wanted
to
raise
the
price
and
encourage
domestic
production
among
other
things?
