mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
accordance
with
the
court’s
instructions,
we
have
briefed
the
anti-injunction
act
and
in
order
to
prevent
overlapping
of
arguments
we
have
separated
i.e.
our
plan
is
that
i
would
take
ten
minutes.
i
am
not
sure
we
are
going
to
need
that
much
time
mr.
chief
justice
to
argue
the
anti-injunction
act
and
mr.
dondis
will
address
himself
to
arguing
that
the
president
and
the
federal
energy
administrator
lacked
the
authority
to
impose
the
license
fees
on
imported
petroleum.
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
except
that
we
were
asked
to
brief
it
and
argue
it
and
the
basis
of
request
to
this
court,
we
have
done
that
and
i
have
come
down
here
to
argue
it
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
that
is
an
essential
argument
at
this
point.
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
there
is
no
debate
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
parties
cannot
confer
a
jurisdiction
upon
this
court
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure.
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
i
will
do
whatever
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
be
here
to
sit
down
or
ague
the
anti-injunction
act.[laughter]
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
just
take
a
few
minutes
on
this.
i
think
there
is
simply
the
license
fee
is
imposed
here
are
not
a
tax.
they
are
some
sort
of
a
high
breed
and
i
might
add
that
we
at
no
point
claim
they
are
a
tax
even
in
mr.
dondis’
argument.
we
may
claim
there
is
something
in
the
nature
or
a
high
breed,
in
the
nature
of
ability
--
an
attempt
to
exercise
a
tariff
of
power
which
resides
with
congress.
it
would
be
anomalous
to
--
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
this
is
not
a
tax.
we
never
contend
that
there
is
a
tax
mr.
justice
at
any
point
in
our
argument.
to
attempt
to
apply
the
anti-injunction
act
which
is
internal
revenue
code
title
xxvi
to
the
trade
laws
of
the
united
states
would
be
anomalous.
the
very
purpose
and
i
suppose
very
simple
purpose
of
the
anti-injunction
act
is
to
make
sure
that
we
have
a
guarantee
of
revenue
to
run
our
government.
that
is
totally
outside
the
intent
of
this
act
with
which
we
are
dealing
in
this
licensees
which
are
regulatory
in
nature.
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
i
would
say
that
would
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
no,
the
anti-injunction
act
applies,
in
my
judgment,
very
simply
to
taxes
imposed
under
the
internal
revenue
code
title
xxiv
and
no
others.
congress
was
not
directly
involved
in
the
imposition
of
these
fees.
it
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
rising
revenue
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
are
raised
probably
the
most
massive
amounts
of
revenues
more
than
any
other
tariff
power
in
the
united
states.
in
1974,
the
year
before
this,
all
of
the
commodities
that
were
entered
into
this
country
amounted
to
$4.8
billion.
if
this
program,
this
license
fee
program
had
reached
its
ultimate
conclusion
it
would
have
anticipated
$4.8
billion.
however,
the
court
has
said
that,
has
defined
the
tax
as
that
which
is
in
the
condition
to
be
collected
as
a
tax
and
claimed
by
the
proper
official
to
be
tax.
the
license
fee
scheme
falls
on
both
of
these
counts.
it
is
not
collected
by
an
internal
revenue
officer
under
the
color
of
office.
it
is
not
deposited
in
the
general
funds
of
the
treasury.
it
is
collected
by
the
federal
energy
administrator
and
deposited
it
in
suspense
account
and
may
without
appropriation
be
used
for
refunds
and
payments
incident
to
the
implementation
of
the
license
fee
program.
i
am
not
sure
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
justices
how
much
longer
we
want
to
go
into
any
follow-up
presentation
of
the
anti-injunction
act.
i
think
very
simply
it
does
not
apply
to
taxes
outside
the
internal
revenue
code
and
obviously
the
very
purpose
of
the
act
to
perpetuate
and
to
make
sure
the
security
of
revenue
does
not
apply
all
here.
mr.
francis
x.
bellotti
in
the
interest
mr.
chief
justice,
having
no
overlapping
arguments
i
will
give
my
time
to
mr.
dondis.
