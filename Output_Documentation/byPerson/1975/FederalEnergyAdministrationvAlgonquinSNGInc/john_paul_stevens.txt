justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
give
me
an
example
or
two.
i
just
do
not
have
any
in
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
some
spending
power
just
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
use
of
monetary
exactions
to
regulate
commerce?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dondis
did
you
make
this
argument
in
the
lower
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
district
court
did
not
pass
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
response
to
the
solicitor
generalâ€™s
argument
that
we
may
not
consider
it
because
it
would
not
sustain
the
judgment
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
may
not
understand
your
argument.
is
your
non-uniformity
argument
one
that
is
intended
to
demonstrate
that
is
not
a
tariff
because
it
is
not
uniform
or
it
is
the
one
that
is
demonstrated,
intended
to
demonstrate
the
relief
should
be
to
eliminate
the
lack
of
uniformity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
constitutional
question
derived
from
the
non-uniformity
point
unless
we
decided
it
is
a
tariff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
the
constitution
requires
a
license
fee
system
to
be
uniform?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
example
could
not
the
president
say
we
will
have
no
imports
at
all
through
the
west
coast
or
the
east
coast,
one
or
the
other,
just
close
up
certain
ports
to
the
import
of
oil,
could
that
be
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
make
a
due
process
argument
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
understand,
the
thrust
of
your
non-uniformity
argument,
i
really
do
not
have
it
yet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
supposed
to
be
interpreted
to
require
uniform
treatment
of
all
parts
of
the
country,
if
there
were
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
had
quotas
administered
by
different
ports
of
the
country,
they
have
to
be
uniform
in
every
port,
is
what
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dondis,
perhaps
the
answer
is
in
the
paper.
if
you
win,
where
does
the
money
go?
what
happens
to
the
$4
billion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
whom?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
change
in
import
even
though
it
is
indirect,
nevertheless
an
adjustment
in
an
import?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
license
fees
will
have
an
impact
or
no
impact
on
the
level
of
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
certain
as
to
whether
it
has
any
impact
at
all
or
just
uncertain
as
to
amount?
