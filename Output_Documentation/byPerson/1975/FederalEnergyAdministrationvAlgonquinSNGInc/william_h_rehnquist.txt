mr.
solicitor
general
bork,
what
authority
does
congress
rely
on
to
levy
an
ordinary
tariff,
is
it
the
power
to
tax
or
the
power
of
commerce
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
bellotti,
what
if
an
action
were
brought
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
tariffs
enacted
by
congress,
would
that
be
subject
to
the
anti-injunction
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
levied
under
--
even
though
congress
was
exercising
its
taxing
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
congress
could
have
not
done
this?
