justice

marshall
mr.
solicitor,
to
oversimplify
you
say
that
it
is
restricted
to
tariffs
and
quotas,
congress
could
easily
have
said
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
congress
preferred
to
use
that
broad
language
now
what
we
do
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
limited
it
to
the
floor,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
to
change
my
notes
here.
i
heard
the
attorney
general
say
that
it
was
not
a
tax?
do
i
have
to
change
my
notes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
buy
that
argument,
we
have
to
find
that
this
is
actually
a
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
we
can
buy
that
argument,
we
have
to
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
we
find
that
this
is
not
a
tax,
what
good
is
your
present
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
next
case
75-382,
federal
energy
administration
against
algonquin
sng.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
section
232
(b)
of
the
trade
expansion
act
of
1962
provides
that
on
finding
that
an
article
is
being
imported
in
such
quantities
or
under
such
circumstances
as
to
threaten
to
impair
the
national
security,
the
president
is
authorized
to
take
such
action,
as
he
deems
necessary
to
adjust
the
imports
of
the
article,
so
that
such
imports
will
no
longer
threaten
to
impair
the
national
security.
invoking
this
provision,
president
nixon
imposed
a
license
fee
system
of
all
imports
in
1973
and
president
ford
modified
the
system
in
75.
respondents
challenged
the
license
fee
system
in
two
suits
brought
in
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
denied
respondents
relief,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
232
(b)'s
authorization
to
the
president
to
take
such
action
as
he
deems
necessary
to
adjust
the
imports,
extends
only
to
quantitative
methods
of
adjustment
such
as
imposition
of
quotas
and
does
not
authorize
the
imposition
of
the
license.
our
examination
of
the
language
of
232
(b)
as
well
as
it's
legislative
history,
we
conclude
that
the
provision
does
indeed
authorize
the
president
to
impose
a
system
of
license
fees
on
all
imports.
therefore
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
