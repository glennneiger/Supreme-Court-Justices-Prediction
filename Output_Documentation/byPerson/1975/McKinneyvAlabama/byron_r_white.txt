justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
crime
there
i
take
it
is
not
selling
an
obscene
material,
but
selling
some
material
that
has
been
declared
to
be
obscene?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that
is
what
says
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
the
state
law
says,
it
shall
be
a
criminal
offense
for
any
person
to
sell
any
material
that
has
been
--
as
human
food
that
has
been
declared
to
be
unfit
for
human
consumption
by
any
court
of
the
state
and
a
gentleman
is
given
notice
in
the
letter
that
this
material
that
i
see
on
your
shelf
here
has
been
declared
to
be
unfit
and
the
man
sells
it
anyway
and
he
is
charged
with
the
crime.
do
you
think,
he
then
has
to
--
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
or
may
he
demand
that
the
state,
prove
again
that
food
is
unfit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
are
not
relying
on
just
typical
criminal
or
res
judicata.
you
are
saying
that
the
first
amendment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
requires
that
in
this
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
be
making
this
argument
and
you
are
making
your
argument
even
on
the
assumption
that
the
magazine
in
this
case
was
precisely
the
same
issue
as
it
was
declared
obscene
in
mobile?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
argue,
that
is
what
you
have
to
first
convince
somebody
including
the
majority
of
the
court
that
the
issue
of
obscenity
is
an
end.
it
has
to
be
in
the
criminal
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
statute
on
its
face,
it
does
not
make
an
issue
out
of
it.
it
does
not
make
obscenity
an
issue.
you
have
to
say
that
it
is
an
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
material
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
the
question.
the
statute
says
if
you
sell
something
that
has
been
declared
to
be
obscene?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
given
notice.
given
as
notice
(inaudible)
he
was
called
that
this
is
true
that
this
particular
publication
have
declared
since.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
knew
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
itself
was
a
reminder
of
concurrence.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
gentleman
who
is
told
then
says,
well
i
was
not
part
of
that.
(inaudible)
furthermore,
if
we
go
into
civil
standard
is
there.
i
am
sure
that
nobody
could
present
the
theory
of
that
and
he
tries
to
make
certain
of
a
case
and
issue
whether
the
food
is
good
or
not
and
the
court
tells
about
the
issue
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
understand
that,
say
the
obscenity
issue
was
in
this
proceeding.
it
may
not
have
been
for
the
jury
or
may
have
been
for
the
judge,
do
you
seem
to
think
that
the
defendant
really
did
have
some
right
under
the
statute
even
though
he
is
only
charged
with
selling
something
that
have
already
been
declared
to
be
obscene,
some
right
to
raise
the
obscenity
issue
and
have
it
adjudicated
to
some
extent
any
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
certainly
that
does
not
seem
to
what
the
statute
is
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
urging
us
to
accept
that
as
a
construction
of
the
alabama
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
or
are
you
not,
i
mean,
we
ought
to
judge
the
case
on
one
basis
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
trial
court
said
that
the
charge
or
the
offense
has
been
charged,
it
does
not
include
the
issue
of
obscenity?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
power
of
court
ruling,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
in
the
colloquy
before
that,
the
judge
made
that
ruling,
did
he
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think,
a
publication
as
declared
obscene
in
mobile
in
a
civil
proceeding
brought
by
the
state
against
mr.
a
and
then
the
state
attorney
general
takes
a
copy
of
that
declaration
and
injunction
and
mails
it
to
all
the
bookstores
in
the
state
and
the
law
says
that
anybody
who
sells
in
the
face
of
that
declaration
is
guilty
of
contempt.
everybody
else
with
notice
is
bound
by
the
injunction,
that
any
bookstore
selling
the
book
would
automatically
be
found
in
contempt
without
any
hearing
other
than
going
to
the
sale.
if
he
sold
it,
he
is
guilty
of
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
say
under
the
constitution
if
the
state
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
state
provided
and
has
that
sort
of
a
provision,
i
would
think
a
fortiori
you
would
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
yet
you
could
say
--
