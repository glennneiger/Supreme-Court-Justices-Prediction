mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
rather
than
chance
for
getting
it
i
would
like
to
respond
to
something
counsel
pointed
out
this
point
in
the
appendix
where
judge
gibson
told
mr.
mckinney’s
counsel,
“i
think
i
can
cut
your
argument
short.”
counsel
cites
at
page
a(81),
in
the
precise
middle
of
the
page,
the
court,
“i
think
i
can
cut
your
argument
short.”
counsel
argues
that
shows
the
trial
judge
was
flatly
refusing
to
consider
any
question
of
obscenity.
the
statement
has
to
be
taken
in
context.
and
the
context
was
that
this
was
the
point
in
the
trial
where
the
state
offered
this
magazine
into
evidence
in
mr.
mckinney’s
trial.
without
any
balance,
the
state
simply
offered
it
in
evidence
and
mr.
mckinney’s
counsel
objected
on
the
grounds
that
obscenity
was
not
for
the
jury
and
judge
heard
some
arguments
and
then
he
told
counsel,
“i
think
i
can
cut
your
argument
short.”
in
effect
i
sustain
your
objection,
i
will
not
let
that
question
go
to
jury.
i
will
let
the
magazine
in
on
the
issue
of
sale
alone.
so
i
would
call
that
to
the
court’s
attention.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir,
frankly.
i
believe
there
are
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no
sir,
i
believe
his
objection
was
that
the
question
of
obscenity
was
simply
not
for
the
jury
in
this
case.
it
was
not
a
question
of
fact.
now,
i
will
say
this
about
the
question
of
obscenity
in
this
criminal
prosecution.
under
jenkins
versus
georgia,
it
seems
to
me
that
where
you
have
a
determination
of
obscenity
that
it
is
outlandish,
that
whether
material
clearly
is
not
obscene
that
any
court
confronted
with
that
has
a
right
and
a
duty
to
go
into
that.
and
i
think
we
see
this
in
mr.
justice
faulkner’s
decision.
they
write
at
length
about
what
new
directions
contain
and
i
think
they
did
review
and
see
if
there
was
a
question
of
obscenity
at
least.
i
am
not
saying
that
they
can
all
map
the
whole
thing
go
back
and
start
all
over
but
you
can
look
that
the
court
would
be
under
duty
to
look
at
the
material
and
see
if
at
least
arguably
there
is
a
question
of
obscenity.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that
is
right
sir.
in
response
to
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
he
told
the
jury
–-
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that
was
in
response
though
to
mr.
mckinney’s
objection.
he
said
i
will
do
this
in
answer
to
your
objection.
i
sustain
your
objection.
this
is
what
i
will
do.
i
will
give
these
instructions
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
pardon
sir,
i
did
not
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
well,
that
was
his
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well
he
objected
and
when
the
judge
said
this
is
what
i
will
do,
he
did
not
object
it
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
do
not
read
the
record
that
way
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
in
response
to
mr.
mckinney’s
objection
that
obscenity
was
not
for
the
jury.
the
judge
was
agreeing
with
it.
in
addition
when
the
judge
gave
this
charges
to
the
jury,
mr.
mckinney
made
no
objection
at
all.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
i
think
that
was
his
objection
that
the
question
of
obscenity
was
not
for
this
jury.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes.
well
sir,
i
do
not
believe
this
record
contains
any
reference
except
in
response
to
this
objection
which
mr.
mckinney
made,
any
reference
to
the
judge
saying
that
question
of
obscenity
was
not
involved
in
here
at
all.
however,
we
defend
that
the
statute
on
that
basis
assuming
the
correctness
of
petitioner’s
analysis.
now,
the
petitioner
relies
very
heavily
on
smith
versus
california
saying
there
is
no
showing
of
scienter
in
this
case.
there
is
no
requirement
for
scienter,
he
says.
frankly,
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
in
response
to
these
arguments.
i
do
not
know
if
i
understand
them.
this
statute
requires
scienter
in
two
forms.
the
accused
must
know
the
nature
of
the
contents
of
the
publication
and
that
complies
with
smith
as
i
read
smith,
but
then
the
statute
says
he
must
also
know,
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
prior
judicial
determination
and
both
of
these
factors
were
proven.
we
attempted
to
prove
some
other
things
that
would
have
shown
scienter,
we
think,
but
on
mr.
mckinney’s
objection,
they
were
kept
out.
but
if
we
did
not
prove
scienter
in
this
case,
it
is
just
not
possible
for
the
state
to
prove
scienter.
we
handed
him
a
written
notice
stating
these
materials
have
been
judicially
declared
obscene,
the
case
number,
the
date,
and
the
court.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
we
can
do
beyond
that.
then
it
is
just
before
the
sale
he
was
shown
the
contents.
so
i
cannot
say
anything
about
scienter
except
that
it
was
required
and
proven.
now,
this
honorable
court
has
ruled
on
numerous
occasions
that
the
obscenity
of
a
material
arises
out
of
the
thing
itself.
it
is
a
–-
the
word
obscenity
describes
its
nature
and
if
it
has
that
nature
it
is
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
now
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir,
if
the
community
involved
is
the
county.
now,
under
this
statute,
the
community
is
the
state
and
this
was
specifically
held
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
case
of
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
oh!
well,
your
honor,
this
honorable
court
has
held
in
hamling
and
in
miller
and
other
cases
that
the
state
made
use
of
state
standard
or
a
smaller
standard.
now,
in
the
statutes
that
do
not
use
this
prior
civil
proceeding,
we
use
a
smaller
community
for
the
purposes
of
banning
it.
of
course,
the
first
amendment
would
protect
all
of
it
without
regard,
but
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
that
standard
under
the
community
under
this
statute
is
the
state
as
a
whole.
we
argue
in
brief
that
since
the
nature
of
the
material
is
the
issue
when
we
are
talking
about
obscenity
that
an
interim
proceeding
is
most
appropriate
to
determine
it.
now,
the
petitioner
agues
that
he
was
not
confronted
back
his
accusers.
he
was
not
proven
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
this
argument
totally
ignores
the
peculiar
corpus
delicti
of
his
crime.
as
i
think
has
already
been
pointed
out,
he
was
not
charged
and
he
is
not
convicted
with
merely
selling
obscenity.
he
is
charged
with
selling
materials
that
had
been
judicially
declared
obscene
or
judicially
found
to
be
obscene
and
his
crime
has
overtones
that
contempt
the
court.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
he
is
guilty
of
contempt
to
court,
but
it
is
that
sort
of
a
crime,
the
disregard
of
judicial
determination.
i
do
not
care
what
the
judge
says,
i
am
going
to
go
on
and
sell
it
and
with
regard
to
the
corpus
delicti
of
his
crime,
he
confronted
each
witness,
cross-examined
each
witness
and
was
proven
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
jury
was
thoroughly
charged
on
reasonable
doubt
and
the
corpus
delicti
as
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
not
to
the
jury.
no
sir.
as
i
read
the
statute
on
the
alabama,
now,
at
that
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
merely
answering
your
question
academically,
because
i
do
not
know.
at
that
time,
we
were
not
sure
about
the
statute
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
not
mr.
smith,
but
mr.
mckinney’s
counsel.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
think
it
was.
i
think
they
did
have
some
responsibility.
but
whether
they
did
or
not,
i
think
that
the
most
they
could
have
gotten
under
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
would
be
if
they
could
have
gotten
the
trial
judge
to
have
looked
at
this
thing
under
the
jenkins
precedent
to
see.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
would
–-
let
me
say
this
sir
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
let
me
say
this.
i
believe
under
the
statute
that
if
your
had
a
material
such
as
the
motion
picture
carnal
knowledge,
it
was
involved
in
jenkins
that
if
you
had
a
material
where
there
was
a
really
a
serious
question
as
to
the
validity
of
this
other
determination
of
obscenity
that
you
could
re-litigate
it.
now,
i
do
not
necessarily
mean
only
in
the
carnal
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no
sir,
not
necessarily.
but
i
do
believe
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
believe
under
this
statute
he
could
have
re-opened
it
in
another,
his
own
civil
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
let
me
say
this
sir.
maybe
i
am
thinking
ahead
of
myself.
in
our
brief,
we
simply
say
and
this
is
our
position,
that
under
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
the
question
of
obscenity,
it
is
not
clear
that
the
question
of
obscenity
is
closed
forever
and
for
all
time.
now,
how
he
could
raise
it,
is
just
not
presented
by
this
case
because
mr.
mckinney
did
not
attempt
it.
whether
or
not
he
could
have
brought
another
civil
proceeding
under
69
act
which
creates
a
right
to
declaratory
judgment,
once
you
receive
this
notice.
and
you
know
he
received
a
notice
under
the
69
act
and
that
permits
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
to
determine
whether
a
material
is
obscene.
now,
whether
or
not
he
could
do
that,
we
say
that
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
is
not
clear
on
this.
it
is
clear
that
mr.
justice
faulkner
in
his
opinion
talks
about
shifts
in
standards
of
obscenity.
he
says
the
standards
of
obscenity
not
having
changed
from
the
time
of
the
trial
until
the
time
of
the
sale
and
so
on.
now,
this
implies
that
the
question
is
not
closed
once
and
for
all.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
exactly
what
was
your
question?
i
thought
i
was
answering
it.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
it
is
simply
not
obscene.
my
answer
is
either
he
would
have
the
right
to
do
that
or
to
file
a
declaratory
judgment.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
either
that
or
a
declaratory
judgment
is.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
the
answer
is
i
am
not
sure
because
of
the
contempt
overtones
of
this
particular
corpus
delicti.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
disregard
of
a
judicial
order
having
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
he
was
not,
he
could
not
be
held
in
contempt.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
this
crime,
the
way
it
is
defined
involves
disregarding
a
judicial
determination
which
is
like
contempt.
we
are
not
saying
that
he
was
convicted
of
contempt
of
court.
what
we
are
saying
that
the
gravamen
of
this
offense
was
a
disregard
of
a
judicial
order
rather
than
just
selling
obscenity.
and
because
of
this,
were
this
question
to
come
up
in
a
civil
trial,
the
argument
could
be
made
that
your
crime
was
disregarding
the
judicial
order,
and
therefore,
you
could
not
raise
it
in
the
criminal
case,
but
that
does
not
mean
you
could
have
not
brought
your
own
action.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
it
was
an
interim
proceeding.
the
parties
do
not
make
any
difference
in
an
interim
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no
sir,
that
is
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
he
was
prosecuted
for
selling
something,
the
status
of
which
had
been
determined
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
he
would
not
be
disobeying
the
order.
he
would
be
selling
something
that
has
been
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well
sir,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
because
that
word
obscene
there
in
that
the
complaint
could
be
construed
that
way,
but
that
did
not
how
the
alabama
supreme
court
construed
it.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
way
it
has
been
construed
all
along.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir,
i
think
so
because
they
say
obscene
printed
material
that
has
been
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene,
i
believe
that
the
word
obscene
when
it
says
obscene
printed
material,
whatever,
is
simply
describing
the
thing.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
do
not
see
the
distinction.
i
simply
cannot
answer
your
question.
i
think
that
the
statement
obscene
material
is
simply
describing
the
thing
and
then
why
is
it
obscene
because
it
has
been
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir,
that
was
charged
to
the
jury.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that
was
charged
to
the
jury.
yes
sir,
without
objection
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
well
sir,
of
course
this
is
why
i
say
that
in
spite
of
the
petitioner’s
interpretation
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
decision
to
the
effect
that
the
question
of
obscenity
was
closed
without
regard
to
anything
else
is
simply
is
not
so.
obviously
in
this
case
he
could
not
--
there
must
be
a
way
that
an
individual
who
is
not
a
party
to
that
suit
can
obtain
relief
from
it
and
alabama
law
provides
two
possibilities.
one
would
be
and
this
one
i
am
certain
of,
his
own
declaratory
judgment
action
and
possibly
and
i
think
probably
in
that
sort
of
a
case
where
the
thing
is
obviously
not
obscene,
he
could
raise
it
in
his
criminal
trial
under
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well
as
soon
as
he
found
out
about
it
he
could
file
that
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
mckinney
in
this
case
when
he
got
that
notice,
he
could
have
sought
declaratory
judgment
at
that
point.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
you
could
not,
after
he
got
arrested,
he
could
have
not,
i
guess
you
could
still
file
the
declaratory
judgment
action
then.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
the
law
of
alabama
is
very
clear
that
the
would
be
censor
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
case
came
up
in
the
cased
cited,
i
believe
by
both
parties,
i
know
by
us,
visual
educators
v.
koppel
in
which
it
happen
to
involve
a
suit
by
a
theater,
an
expresser
against
the
city
that
did
not
want
to
license
it
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
ruled
in
no
uncertain
terms,
of
course,
they
say
the
burden
is
on
the
would
be
censor.
in
that
case,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
expresser
that
brought
the
suit.

no,
under
this
statute?
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
it
has
the
statute
like
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
think
if
you
are
talking
about
contempt.
now,
if
they
sent
notice
around
to
them
joining
them
as
parties
or
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
in
as
parties
they
would
be
bound.
but
if
you
are
talking
there
about
straight
contempt,
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
thank
you
so
much.
