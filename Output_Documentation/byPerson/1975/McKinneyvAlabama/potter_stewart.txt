justice

stewart
may
i
ask
question?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
appeal
from
the
mobile
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
second
question.
what
was
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
mobile
litigation?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
it,
not
what
it
would
have
been?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
are
talking
now
about
this
section
4
appearing
on
page
20?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
–-
what
you
have
given
us
so
far
really
is
preamble
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
conviction
on
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
your
appendix,
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
gone
so
fast
that
you
are
losing
me.
go
back
to
where
you
are
a
few
minutes
ago.
if
you
look
at
page
a(100)
of
the
appendix
and
you
see
that
the
caption
of
the
case
is
state
of
alabama
against
among
others.
new
directions
number
14,
volume
4,
number
4,
then
you
pointed
out
around
page
101,
that
holding
the
judgment
as
against
new
directions
number
16,
volume
4,
number
4.
now,
what
if
anything
are
you
making
out
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wonder,
what
are
you
making
out
of
that
to
call
our
attention
to?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is,
when
he
got
the
notice
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
16?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
what
the
judgment
was
about?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
is
really
and
i
hope
you
are
not
getting,
trying
to
get
much
mileage
out
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
will
be
interested
in
what
your
arguments
are
and
what
you
are
relying?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
difference
between
this
case
and
the
food
case?
justice
potter
stewart
what
bothers
me
mr.
marston
about
this
particular
case
is
that
the
complaint
which
i
gather
is
equivalent
in
your
practice
to
information.
justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint
seems
to
telescope
two
alternative
provisions
of
the
criminal
statute.
if
you
look
on
page
5
of
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
is
the
court’s
opinion,
it
starts
the
statement,
“the
petitioner
was
charged
by
complaint
that
he
did
sell
obscene
printed
or
written
material;
then
that
said
material
had
been
judicial
found
to
be
obscene,”
whereas
the
statute
if
you
look
on
page
5
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
to
sell
obscene
material
or
to
sell
material
that
is
judicially
been
determined
to
be
obscene
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
particular
case
the
prosecution
by
alleging
that
he
sold
obscene
material
as
a
matter
of
fact
put
the
obscenity
of
that
material
very
much
an
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
when
you
look
at
page
5
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
petitioner
was
charged
by
complaint
that
he,
read
the
first
four
lines
of
that,
that
he
did
sell
obscene
printed
or
written
material;
do
you
see
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
charge
that
he
sold
anything
that
would
have
been
judicially
determined
to
be
obscene?
justice
potter
stewart
it
simply
is
a
claim
that
he
sold
obscene
printed
or
written
material
which
puts
in
issue
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
printed
or
written
material
is
obscene,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
as
far
as
the
statute
makes
it
an
offense
to
sell
obscene
material
and
also
makes
it
an
offense
to
sell
material
that
is
judicially
been
determined
to
be
obscene
whether
or
not
it
is
obscene,
if
you
look
at
section
374
(4)
1
on
page
5
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
here
the
complaint
telescopes
two
alternative
sections
of
the
criminal
statute,
and
therefore,
made
it
incumbent
upon
the
prosecution
to
show
both
that
the
material
was
obscene
and
also
that
the
material
was
known
to
have
been
judicially
declared
to
be
obscene,
you
see
my
point?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
quite
different
from
what
the
statute
says
which
makes
it
an
offense
to
send
any
mailable
material
known
by
such
person
to
have
been
judicially
found
to
be
obscene
under
this
chapter,
quite
different?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
you
in
a(9)?
