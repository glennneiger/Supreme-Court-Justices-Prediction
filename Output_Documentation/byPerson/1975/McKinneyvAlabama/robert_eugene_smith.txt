mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
started
back
in
1970
when
a
mobile
judge
in
mobile,
alabama
which
is
approximately
265
miles
from
the
city
of
birmingham
in
a
civil
proceeding
found
a
publication
among
a
series
of
publications
to
be
obscene
under
the
laws
as
being
interpreted
at
that
time.
this
was
a
civil
proceeding
against
a
bookstore
operator
in
mobile,
and
this
would
have
been
in
approximately
february
i
believe
of
1970.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
pardon.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
was
not
the
petitioner
nor
was
there
any
allegation
of
a
relationship
your
honor,
directly
or
indirectly.
then
shortly
after
the
proceedings
in
mobile,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
mr.
barnes,
i
believe
walked
into
petitioner’s
bookstore
in
birmingham
and
handed
him
a
letter
to
advise
him
that
certain
publications
were
obscene
and
had
been
found
obscene
by
a
judge
in
mobile.
now
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
i
think
it
is
conceded
that
there
was
none,
but
of
course
our
petitioner
was
not
anyway
involved.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
would
have
been
the
civil
burden
of
proof
and
that
is
to
say
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
am
told
it
was
preponderance
evidence.
i
was
not
privy.
there
was
no
appeal.
there
was
no
transcript
written
up
of
that
case
and
of
course
our
decision
then
came
down
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
until
may
of
1974,
long
after
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
is
all
that
is
required
in
the
civil
proceeding
under
alabama
law
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
it
is
the
contrary.
and
at
the
time
of
mr.
ferris
ritchie,
counsel
questioning
mr.
charlie
barnes
at
the
time
of
proceedings
in
this
case,
he
tried
to
get
into
what
happened
at
the
trial
and
the
judge
said
that
was
not
relevant
anymore
and
so
he
foreclosed
him
from
having
an
opportunity
to
go
into
any
issues
whatsoever.
so
we
can
take,
i
believe,
the
presumption
that
it
was
a
civil
burden
of
proof
and
that
is
to
say
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
on
that
issue,
yes
sir.
on
that
issue,
but
i
think
our
position
would
be
whereas
we
are
arguing
let
us
say,
one
or
three
or
four
factors
today,
we
would
be
foreclosed
from
several
of
them.
well,
as
i
said,
on
march
10,
1970,
the
attorney
general
went
in
as
i
said
mr.
barnes
and
gave
a
letter
to
mr.
mckinney,
approximately,
a
couple
of
weeks
later,
they
went
back
and
mr.
barnes
together
with
an
investigator
and
found
one
of
the
publications
on
this
list
of
approximately
10,
was
still
on
the
racks
available
for
sale
and
where
upon
they
purchased
it
and
surely
thereafter
filed
a
complaint.
now,
the
notice
provision
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
your
honor,
somewhere
along
in
the
attorney
general’s
brief,
he
says
that
this
is
a
reckless
disregard.
he
was
given
notice.
he
did
not
find
all
ten
publications
there,
that
is
all
i
am
saying.
so
we
were
talking
about
one
out
of
ten
of
the
publications.
he
may
have
had
all
the
ten,
he
may
not
have
all
the
ten,
i
do
not
know.
i
was
just
making
that
as
a
fact
that
he
was
not
just
recklessly
laying
everything
out
that
it
had
been
found
obscene
down
in
mobile
and
said
okay,
now
do
what
you
want.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
attitude
he
was
presenting.
so,
this
letter
was
given
under
the
provisions
of
the
1969
act.
the
1969
act
your
honors
is
found
at,
i
think
page
40
of
the
brief
and
argument
of
the
respondent
reply
to
amicus
curiae
appendices.
and
on
page
46,
under
c
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
white
sir,
brief
and
argument
of
the
respondent
and
reply;
page
46,
section
2,
sub-paragraph
(c).
now,
this
is
the
only
time
this
statute
has
got
anything
to
do
with
this
case
because
it
talked
about
the
fact
and
this
is
sort
of
an
inclusion
in
here,
“nothing
in
the
section
should
be
deemed
to
apply
to
mailing
matter
unless
such
mailable
matter
is
known
by
such
person
to
have
been
found
--
judicially
found
to
be
obscene,”
but
under
the
provisions
of
any
other
alabama
statute.
that
of
course,
section
6
on
page
47
says,
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
cumulative
and
shall
be
in
addition
to
any
other
laws
that
are
enacted.
curiously
enough,
this
case
was
decided
may
9,
1974.
on
may
9,
1974,
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
a
decision
in
other
case
said
that
notice
provision
was
unconstitutional
because
that
represented
a
prior
restraint
much
like
the
bantam
books
and
a
decision
of
this
court
in
the
bygone
era.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor.
section
2(c)
and
section
4
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
section
4.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
section
4
was
found.
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
am
sorry,
was
found,
which
also
has
a
notice
provision
and
they
found
that
unconstitutional.
the
same
day
in
the
case
of
belu
(ph)
versus
the
state
of
alabama,
that
was
case
number
480
and
that
was
on
the
decision
by
the
court.
so
this
gentleman,
mr.
mckinney
was
tried
under
the
provisions
of
a
different
law
and
that
was
a
law
that
was
enacted
in
1961.
and
i
direct
your
attention
your
honors
to
page
20
of
the
brief
and
argument
and
opposition
to
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
also
white.
and
this
is
a
section
which
permits
a
civil
equity
proceeding,
whereby
an
injunction
can
be
obtained
against
the
dissemination
of
a
particular
publication
found
to
be
obscene.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
this
is
the
statute
under
which
mr.
mckinney
was
convicted.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
notice
provision
was
given
pursuant
to
the
1969
act,
but
as
i
said,
that
is
the
last
time
we
deal
with
1969
act.
we
get
back
into
the
61
act
which
is
really
what
we
are
here
before
the
court
today
saying
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
correct.
and
i
merely
say
there
are
two
sections.
there
are
two
remedies
that
can
be
applied.
there
is
a
civil
provision
which
reaches
under
section
11
on
page
25
your
honors
and
that
is
of
course
punishable
by
contempt
and
then
there
is
the
criminal
provisions
and
penalties
which
is
section
4
under
page
20.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
any
mailable
matter
known
by
such
person
who
had
been
judicially
found
to
be
obscene
under
this
act.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
page
20
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
section
4.
no
sir
that
is
the
brief
and
argument
in
opposition,
the
other
white.
it
is
section
4
(1)
and
a
half
way
down
to
the
page
your
honor
and
it
starts,
“or
any
mailable
matter
known
by
such
person
who
had
been
judicially
found
to
be
obscene
under
this
act
shall
be
guilty
with
misdemeanor.”
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
correct.
now,
for
which
mr.
mckinney
received
515
days
for
failing
to
pay
his
fines,
365
days
sentence
and
19
days
for
court
cause.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
started
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
do
you
say
before
your
honors?
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
think
a
question,
the
question
of
obscenity
of
course
is
present.
we
think
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
he
did
not
have
a
chance
to
litigate
the
question
of
obscenity
and
we
say
for
example,
and
here
is
the
part
of
the
confusion
about
the
mobile
decree.
now,
taking
my
appendix
which
we
take
on
page
100
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
the
appendix,
page
100
and
101;
we
have
a
state
exhibit
number
(d)
and
under
that
if
you
look
down
there,
the
state
of
alabama
versus
we
see
several
magazines
and
one
of
which
is
entitled
new
directions,
number
14,
volume
4,
number
4
and
over
in
the
decree
they
say
that
new
directions,
number
16,
volume
4,
number
4
is
obscene.
so
i
am
saying
that
we
start
out
with
confusion
from
the
wording
of
the
decree
or
the
heading
of
the
decree
as
well
as
the
inconsistency
in
the
decree.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so,
but
i
think
this
court
has
already
said
that
in
cases
in
which
you
have
distinguished
the
requirement
scienter
between
first
amendment
matters
and
matters
which
you
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
obscenity
be
allowed
to
be
litigated
and
it
was
not
allowed
to
be
litigated
in
this
question.
now,
counsel
suggests
in
his
brief
that
at
the
time
that
the
publication
was
offered
into
evidence,
mr.
ferris
ritchie
objected.
well,
mr.
ritchie
objected
because
at
the
beginning
of
the
case,
we
had
first
a
demur
filed,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
which
was
denied.
we
had
a
motion
to
quash
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
law
which
was
denied,
going
into
these
issues.
and
even
during
the
proceedings
when
mr.
ritchie
was
trying
to
get
into
some
factors
in
his
argument
at
page
81
of
my
appendix,
the
court
says,
half
way
down
the
page,
i
think
i
can
cut
your
argument
short.
i
have
been
thinking
about
it.
this
court
is
not
going
to
turn
over
any
question
to
the
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
any
magazine
is
obscene.”
and
here
there
is
charge
that
a
man
sold
a
certain
magazine
and
that
had
been
heard
forth
and
adjudicated
as
obscene.
the
court’s
opinion
rules
that
the
magazine
would
be
evidenced
as
such
purchase
and
they
say
for
that
reason
we
will
allow
it
to
be
introduced
into
evidence.
but
he
said,
the
court
feels
that
it
would
be
the
court’s
duty
to
limit
the
purpose
for
which
the
magazine
is
admitted
and
to
instruct
the
jury
not
to
determine
any
questions
of
obscenity
of
the
magazine.
and
later
on
the
judge
goes
on
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
jury
question
time
and
time
again.
the
question
of
obscenity
in
this
case
is
now
questionable
of
law.
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
correct,
because
of
the,
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
am
saying
that
it
would
be
confusion
if
someone
would
have
to
rely
upon
to
verify
and
rely
upon
the
concept
of
the
heading
and
style
of
the
case
down
in
mobile.
one
of
the
points
we
make
your
honor
is
for
example
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
if
a
defendant
as
mr.
mckinney
is
here
wanted
to
verify,
he
just
gets
a
letter,
he
does
not
get
any
really
substantive
facts,
he
gets
a
letter
and
he
says
under
the
decision
of
the
court
in
such
case
and
such
case
in
this
number,
this
publication
was
found
obscene.
i
am
merely
pointing
out
that
there
would
be
some
confusion
if
he
were
to
get
a
copy
of
the
decree.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
16
your
honor.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
i
am
not
your
honor.
i
was
only
saying
that
there
was
some
confusion
that
could
exist
in
the
minds
of
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
prosecution
of
mr.
mckinney,
the
alabama
law
as
interpreted
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
had
not
been
changed
and
modified,
with
regard
to
the
extent
of
community
standards,
unlike
what
this
court
and
or
people
were
saying
this
court
was
saying,
was
the
community
from
which
the
jury
was
drawn.
so
in
city
of
birmingham
versus
jones,
45
alabama,
appellate
86
in
1969
judge
kate
said,
and
i
quote,
“the
community
standard
is
to
be
measured
by
the
area
from
which
the
jury
venire
men
are
drawn.”
now,
that
is
birmingham,
265
miles
away
in
a
different
burden
of
proof,
we
have
mobile,
alabama.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
one
of
the
arguments,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
i
was
trying
to
give
background
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
we
say
first,
obscenity
should
have
been
an
issue
and
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
the
defendant
would
be
denied
his
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
on
a
material
element
of
the
offense,
alleged
offense
here.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
would
be
obscenity.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
but
in
a
proceeding
where
a
man
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury.
so
how
can
legislature
for
example,
suppose
your
honor,
in
mobile,
alabama
was
determined
playboy
was
obscene
in
the
civil
proceeding
in
which
somebody
consented
to
it.
that
would
have
been
a
judicial
declaration
of
obscenity
because
it
was
a
consent
order
and
someone
who
may
have
sold
playboy
hence
in
alabama
to
be
given
notice,
denying
a
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
because
we
have
no
scienter
here
your
honor.
we
are
not
allowed
for
the
man
to
have
exercise
the
right
of
scienter.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
he
was
told
that.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
and
we
say
that
in
the
concept,
consistent
with
due
process
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
litigate
the
issue
of
obscenity
by
virtue
of
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial,
the
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation,
the
point
that
i
made
about
difference
of
application
of
the
different
local
community
standard.
we
have
that
is
in
title
--
that
is
involved
and
implicated
here
and
there
is
just;
he
is
not
allowed
to
have
any
scienter.
now,
in
kingsley
books
versus
brown,
you
all
said
that
it
was
in
a
case
and
where
the
man
was
part
of
the
same
proceeding.
he
was
given
a
civil
notice,
later
on,
the
statute
excluded
him
from
being
able
to
raise
as
a
question
of
scienter
his
lack
of
knowledge
as
to
the
issue
of
obscene.
so
if
the
publication
were
found
obscene
in
the
criminal
cases,
his
scienter
was
gone.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir
i
said
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
one
of
the
differences.
the
principal
difference
i
think
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
number
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
tainted
food
your
honor
would
have
been
scientifically,
i
suppose
determined
to
have
been
tainted
and
unfit
for
human
consumption.
i
do
not
think
we
are
dealing
in
the
printed
word
or
pictures
that
we
are
talking
about,
things
which
we
are
so
capable
of
exact
determination
and
the
public
welfare
requires
that
tainted
food
be
immediately
removed
from
the
marketplace
unless
somebody
gets
sick
and
somebody
fall
ill
and
die
or
such
like
that.
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
same
compelling
urgency.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir.
if
you
take
section
11
your
honor
and
you
read
section
11,
the
injunction
provision,
mr.
mckinney
could
not
have
been
found
have
been
in
contempt
applying
the
injunction
provision,
could
not
have
been
found
guilty
of
contempt
if
he
had
sold
the
publication
unless
he
had
been
a
named
the
party
to
the
case.
but
yet
in
the
criminal
matter,
without
having
the
chance
to
litigate
the
question
of
obscenity,
he
can
be
found
obscene,
he
can
be
not
permitted
to
show
the
difference
in
community
standards
to
a
jury
of
his
peers
and
to
be
able
to
try
to
ascertain
that
issue
and
i
say
that
is
i
think
the
difference,
the
key
difference
between
the
food
matter
that
you
suggest
and
the
other
matter.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well
of
course,
yes
we
do.
we
think
that
chief
justice
huffman
(ph)
has
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
chief
justice
huffman
of
course
has
taken
the
three
points
that
i
have
mentioned
that
is
number
one;
there
was
no
trial
by
jury
permitted
this
man
that
the
man
receive
a
sentence
of
one
year
plus
fine.
that
certainly
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
man
should
be
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
and
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
on
that
issue
of
obscenity
and
we
say
that
that
is
one
of
the
points
i
think,
he
talks
about.
he
also
talks
about
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
was
excluded
by
legislative
feat.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
most
states
treat
parking
offenses
your
honor
in
a
different
category,
i
think
in
an
absolute
criminal
statute.
so
i
think
that
that
becomes
an
ordinance
more
often
than
not
as
versus
a
statute.
and
secondly,
i
do
think
it
would
be
open
for
someone
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
city
counsel’s
right
to
pass
that
ordinance
in
the
event
that
it
went
beyond
the
enabling
clause
granted
to
them
by
the
legislature
so
i
think
there
would
be
other
things.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
assuming
all
other
things
have
been
foreclosed
and
there
were
no
other,
there
was
no
bottom-line
yes
i
do
not
think
he
would
be
able
to
re-litigate
that
question.
but
that
is
as
to
a
matter
involving
a
no
parking
sign.
but
here
we
are
talking
again
and
this
court
has
time
and
time
said
again
that
these
questions
regarding
explicit
material
or
simulated
material
depend
on
difference
between
communities
as
the
chief
justice
has
pointed
out,
i
think
in
the
miller
case
regarding
the
difference
in
various
communities
and
different
state
communities
to
the
tolerance
of
material.
and
i
say
here,
one
of
the
things
as
we
were
--
he
was
not
allowed
to
litigate
this
under
the
birmingham
standard
and
of
course,
the
right
of
confrontation
justice
huffman
refers
to
was
also
denied
counsel
in
this
particular
case.
and
the
law
in
alabama
is
clear
that
in
a
judgment
in
a
civil
suit
cannot
be
admitted
in
a
criminal
prosecution
arising
at
the
same
transaction.
so
we
have
one
standard
that
applies
to
the
same
parties
in
the
case
and
yet
another
standard
that
is
going
to
apply
to
somebody
who
had
no
participation
whatsoever
directly
or
indirectly
under
litigation.
and
we
say
that
that
is
the
exquisite
difference
in
this
case
and
even
justice
huffman
in
pointing
out
what
judge
harwood
said
on
page
a(14)
of
our
appendix.
now,
justice
harwood
said
it
is
clearly
settled
through
the
doctrines
of
our
cases
that
a
judgment
gained
in
the
civil
suit
is
not
admissible
against
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
prosecution
going
under
the
same
transaction.
but
justice
harwood
found
no
difficulty
in
joining
the
prosecution
or
the
majority
of
the
panel
in
judge
faulkner’s
decision
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal
if
it
pleases
the
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
may
it
please
the
court
and
just
a
few
observations.
number
one,
counsel
said
that
it
is
clear
under
alabama
law
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
censor
in
the
civil
declaratory
judgment
cases.
that
was
in
1972
that
that
decision
was
rendered.
so,
in
1970
that
question
was
not
as
open
in
shut
as
it
was
in
1972
in
the
koppel
case.
we
also
point
out,
if
the
court
please
that
taking
a
page
a(5)
of
my
appendix
which
is
the
majority
--
part
of
the
majority
opinion
of
justice
faulkner,
first
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
says
neither
mckinney
nor
the
state
introduced
the
evidence
in
the
trial
on
the
question
of
obscenity
vel
non.
mckinney
raised
that
issue
in
a
motion
to
quash
the
complaint
which
the
trial
judge
overruled
and
in
continuing
to
page
a(7),
justice
faulkner
says
we
now
decide
the
question
of
whether
the
mobile
circuit
court
decree
was
binding
on
mckinney
since
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
action
and
since
obscenity
vel
non
was
not
permitted
as
an
issue
by
the
trial
court
and
even
justice
huffman
says
on
page
a(9),
thus
there
was
no
finding
by
the
jury,
the
matter
alleged
to
be
obscene
was
obscene
and
indeed
no
such
determination
could
have
been
made
under
the
trial
court’s
charge.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
a(9),
first
full
paragraph
your
honor,
the
last
sentence.
so,
and
the
last
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
with
justice
brennan’s
question
regarding
carnal
knowledge.
if
carnal
knowledge
was
found
obscene,
the
day
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jenkins
in
mobile,
alabama
and
notice
were
given
in
birmingham,
alabama
to
mr.
mckinney
if
he
were
a
theater
exhibitor,
he
could
still
be
held
accountable
for
having
violated
the
crime
of
having
displayed
or
exhibited
material
which
had
previously
or
judicially
been
declared
obscene.
even
though
this
court
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
then
i
would
think
these
are
not
the
sensitive
tools
because
this
court
in
a
rarely
unanimous
opinion
in
at
least
in
the
area
of
obscenity
ruled
that
i
thought
that
the
carnal
knowledge
was
not
obscene.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
said
that
at
the
time
your
honors,
the
only
decision
of
a
court
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
do
not
know
and
i
said
the
only
decision
that
a
court
in
alabama
was
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
at
that
time
the
parameters
where
the
community
from
which
the
jury
was
drawn
and
that
is
the
city
of
birmingham
versus
jones
and
that
is
45
alabama
appeals,
86.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
the
first
time
that
court
said
it
is
the
state
standard
is
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
was
not
a
jury.
what
we
are
saying
the
area
from
which
the
jury
venire
men
are
drawn.
that
is
all,
thank
you
your
honors.
