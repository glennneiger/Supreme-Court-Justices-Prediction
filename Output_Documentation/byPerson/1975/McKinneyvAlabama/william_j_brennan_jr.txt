you

with

are

suggesting

that
was
involved
in

civil
proceeding
in

and
had
there
been
held
that

then
carnal

was
shown

instance
the

would
not
be
foreclosed
in
challenging
the
obscenity
of
carnal
knowledge?
justice

j.
brennan,

would
you
answer
my
question?
justice

that
carnal
knowledge
had
been
declared
obscene
in

this
constitution
holding
against
exhibitor
of
carnal
knowledge
in
birmingham,
would
or
would
not
the
exhibitor
have
a
defense
that
the
carnal
knowledge
is
not
obscene?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
time
of
your
proceeding
your
answer
is
yes.
he
could
have
raised
the
issue
of
the
obscenity
of
carnal
knowledge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
my
question
is,
could
you
need
criminal
proceeding,
and
as
i
understand
you
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
disregarding
an
order
to
which
he
was
not
a
party?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
was
prosecuted
for
selling
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
interim
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
did
he
disobey
the
order?
