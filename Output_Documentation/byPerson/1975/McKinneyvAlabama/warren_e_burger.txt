chief

any
difference
whether

one
or
half?
chief
justice
warren
e.

which
present
section

it
said
they
found
that
unconstitutional?
chief

warren
e.

where
were
you
reading
that
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
was
the
letter,
was
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
that
required
notice?
chief

chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
as
justice
white
said,
the
question
of
the
obscenity
is
not
before
us,
but
only
the
question
of
whether
he
had
notice
that
had
been
held
to
be
obscene
in
the
mobile
court
in
the
mobile
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief

warren
e.

that
is
a
question
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
marston.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
litigate
it
and
he
not
only
avoided
it,
but
insisted
on
avoiding
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
absent
objection
from
smith
would
the
issue
of
obscenity
been
submitted
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
get
the
impression
that
you
were
suggesting
mr.
smith
had
some
responsibility
for
keeping
this
issue
away
from
the
jury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
how
do
you
have
contempt
by
overtones?
is
that
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
was
a
judicial
order
here
in
mobile,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
is
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
what
about
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
three
opinions
of
the
court
--
opinions
and
judgments
of
the
court
to
announce
and
will
identify
each
of
them
as
he
announces
those.
