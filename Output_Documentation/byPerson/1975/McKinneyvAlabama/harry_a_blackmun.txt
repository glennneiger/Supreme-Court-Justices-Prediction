does
that
mean
mr.
smith
that
had
mr.
mckinney
in
some
way
been
associated
or
involved
in
the
mobile
proceeding,
you
would
still
be
here
today?

mr.
smith
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
i
thought
what
you
were
arguing
here
and
i
am
might
tell
you
in
all
candor
it
is
the
issue
which
particularly
interests
me
is
whether
there
may
be
a
criminal
conviction?
now,
based
upon
this
finding
in
a
civil
proceeding
whether
it
is
265
miles
away
or
somewhere
else,
reach
down
a
preponderance
of
evidence
in
a
case
to
which
a
criminally
accused
was
not
a
party
whether
it
is
compatible
with
due
process
and
to
convict
the
man
of
a
crime
in
that
circumstance
and
i
thought
that
is
what
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
hope
that
is
the
one
that
you
will
give
most
of
your
attention
to
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
you
have
been
here
several
times
before.
we
have
been
all
through
these
other
questions
that
you
raise.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
can
understand
that
you
were.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
find
any
comfort
in
your
position
and
the
dissent
of
chief
justice?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
his
approach
was
a
little
different
from
that
that
you
can
give
i
think.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
i
misread
him
as
having
suggested
that
under
our
decision
in
winship,
every
element
of
the
criminal
offense
has
to
be
proved
beyond
â€“-
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
and
that
the
deficiency
in
this
conviction
was
that
the
element
of
obscenity
was
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
would
not
have
the
burden
or
proof
in
that
declaratory
judgment?
