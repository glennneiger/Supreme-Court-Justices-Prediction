i
do
not
want
to
prolong
discussion
as
to
what
the
language
means,
but
the
first
full
paragraph
on
a81
which
contains
the
objection
by
the
counsel.
as
i
read
it
he
is
objecting
to
allowing
the
jury
to
see
the
magazine
without
the
introduction
of
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
obscene.
the
objection
really
was
to
the
denial
of
the
right
to
litigate
before
that
jury
the
issue
of
obscenity.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
only
if
the
course,
the
judge
refused
to
allow
any
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
magazine
was
obscene
because
the
judge
took
the
position
of
that
already
had
been
determined.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
marston,
i
put
this
case
to
you.
assume
that
the
court
in
mobile
instead
of
having
this
particular
magazine
before
it
could
have
the
art
catalog
of
the
state
museum
and
have
found
it
to
be
obscene.
would
that
sustain
a
prosecution
under
this
section
of
the
alabama
statute?
