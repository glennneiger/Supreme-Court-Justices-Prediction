justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
supposing
you
have
an
ordinance
that
proscribes
parking
in
an
area
where
there
is
a
no
parking
sign
and
you
have
done
that
and
you
go
into
court
and
you
say,
well
i
got
a
right
to
re-litigate
the
question
whether
there
should
have
been
a
no
parking
sign
because
that
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
is
it
not
open
to
the
state
at
least
in
that
case
to
say
that
simply
is
not
open
here?
that
is
not
element
of
the
offense.
the
presence
of
the
sign
alone
makes
the
only
element
offense,
did
you
park
there
or
did
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
it
is
beyond
the
enabling
clause,
but
would
they
be
able
to
re-litigate
in
court
the
question
whether
the
city
council
should
have
decided
that
that
was
a
no
parking
space?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
declaratory
judgment
will
not
do
him
much
good
if
he
is
already
in
jail
as
a
result
of
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
except
the
mobile
proceeding,
would
that
involve
a
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
one
i
will
identify
as
mckinney
against
alabama,
no.
74-532,
in
which
case
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
an
alabama
state
court
of
selling
material
which
had
been
judicially
declared
obscene.
at
his
trial,
he
was
not
permitted
to
litigate
the
question
of
whether
the
material
was
obscene,
even
though
he
had
not
been
a
party
to
the
earlier
civil
adjudication
in
which
it
was
held
obscene.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
this
procedure
was
consistent
with
our
previous
decisions
delineating
the
safeguards
which
must
attend
the
attempts
by
the
states
to
prohibit
dissemination
of
expression
asserted
to
be
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
against
such
interference.
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
an
opinion
which
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
which
affirms
petitioner's
conviction.
we
conclude
that
the
constitution
prohibits
the
state
from
binding
petitioner
by
means
of
an
adjudication
rendered
in
a
proceeding
in
which
he
had
neither
notice
nor
any
opportunity
to
be
heard.
in
order
to
assure
that
his
right
to
freedom
of
expression
under
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
is
adequately
protected,
we
hold
that
he
must
be
afforded
some
opportunity
to
litigate
on
his
own
behalf,
whether
the
material
which
he
sought
to
disseminate
was
obscene,
before
he
may
be
convicted
of
selling
obscene
material.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined
and
which
mr.
justice
stewart
has
joined
in
part.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
