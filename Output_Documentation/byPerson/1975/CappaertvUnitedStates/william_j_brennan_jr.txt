justice
jr.
to
a
duty
to
the
extent
of
the
federal
law?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
allison,
before
you
sit
down,
does
your
state
in
nevada
in
its
administrative
proceedings
or
anything
else,
make
any
distinction
between
surface
water
and
underground
water?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
an
old
principle,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
western
water
right,
but
in
other
words
then,
you
almost
concede
the
hydrological
if
that
is
the
right
word,
connection
between
surface
water
and
underground
water?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
on
what
nevada
argued
it
today
namely
that
there
ought
to
be
in
some
forum
the
kind
of
balancing
of
all
these
interests
would
mean
that
the
federal
government
submitted
to
it
then
federal
government
is
bound
to
lose?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
as
you
recognize
it
as
you
define
it
today?
justice
jr.
and
that
would
mean
you
are
bound
to
win
just
as
you
did
below?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
last
answer
to
me
suggest
that
even
if
the
government
office
permits
that
nevertheless
a
proceeding
might
still
be
initiated
to
determine
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
there
was
any
vested
back
in
the
day
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
filed
where
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
would
he
do,
set
up
a
proceeding
in
which
again
the
initial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
always
review
again
in
the
nevada
courts
and
ultimately
here?
