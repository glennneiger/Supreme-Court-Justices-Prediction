mr.
george
allison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
it
has
been
indicated,
i
am
representing
the
state
of
nevada
and
i
think
the
assertion
by
the
united
states
government
that
nevada's
concern
in
this
and
i
think
the
concern
of
several
western
states
is
indicated
by
the
briefs
that
were
filed
on
amicus
capacity
is
that
it
is
substantially
broader
in
our
eyes
than
the
conflict
between
the
rancher
and
pupfish
at
this
time.
and
if
there
is
a
substantial
conflict,
not
only
a
present
conflict,
but
a
real
potential
for
future
conflict
then
that
conflict
is
the
state,
federal
conflict
in
the
use
and
management
of
water
in
all
the
western
states,
particularly
a
state
like
nevada,
but
there
are
many
others
that
fall
in
the
same
category.
nevada
happens
to
be
that
drives
all
the
states.
it
gets
less
9
inches
of
rain,
but
i
think
arizona
and
many
of
the
other
states
qualify.
mr.
george
allison
no,
not
necessarily.
the
principle,
historically
the
states
have
controlled
the
determination
of
water
rights
for
use
in
a
particular
the
states
and
the
principle
that
has
evolved
is
that,
and
that
includes
the
united
states
government
as
i
think
one
of
the
justices
indicated
earlier,
except
in
the
case
where
congress
expressly
indicated
otherwise.
everything
else
was
left
historically
to
the
prerogative
of
the
states.
now,
this
principle
resulted
in
a
great
deal
of
certainty
in
determining
water
rights.
a
certainty
in
determining
the
water
rights
in
those
states
was
probably,
well
probably
still
is,
not
then,
but
is
now
the
single
most
important
factor
in
the
development,
the
economic
development
of
those
states
and
the
certainty
only
came
because
the
states
were
allowed
to
determine
those
rights
unless
congress
expressly
indicated
otherwise.
then
when
you
insert
not
an
expressed
--
an
expression
of
congress,
but
an
implied
right
considered
it
a
later
time
in
the
reservation,
right
away
you
begin
to
raise
havoc
with
the
certainty
that
the
states
have
established
in
determining
those
rights.
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
states
become
concerned
because
the
reservation,
or
position
of
the
government
as
i
understand
it
is
the
mere
act
of
reserving
the
land,
but
nothing
further.
no
consideration
of
the
circumstances,
the
need,
the
extent
of
injury,
the
importance
of
the
water,
the
mere
act
of
reserving
the
land
automatically
establishes
the
priority
for
the
water
date.
now,
that
water
right
may
not
be
ascertained
by
the
united
states
government
for
20
years
in
the
future.
in
the
meantime,
the
state
of
nevada
is
granting
rights
to
many
adjacent
property
owners.
so
they
begin
using
these
adjacent
water
rights
for
20
years.
suddenly
20
years
later,
the
government
says
we
have
a
water
right
and
our
priority
date
is
the
date
we
reserve
it
even
though
at
that
time
we
did
not
know
we
wanted
it
and
that
is
what
is
causing
us
concern
and
i
think
the
magnitude
of
that
is
amplified
if
i
might
quote
just
one
or
two
short
statistics
is
that
in
the
state
of
nevada
for
example
and
in
fact,
i
am
think
in
11
of
the
western
states,
where
61%
of
the
land
and
11
of
western
states
that
is
federally
reserved
land.
right
now
in
the
state
of
nevada,
you
cannot
have
a
major
ranch
unless
it
is
either
next
to
or
part
of
federally
reserved
land.
you
simply
cannot
have
it
because
there
is
so
much
federal
reserved
lands,
76%
of
the
state
of
nevada
is
federally
reserved
land.
all
major
sources
of
water
in
the
state
of
nevada
come
from
federal
reserved
land
and
that
includes
underground
water
which
is
charged
by
water
from
runoff
from
federally
reserved
land
and
that
is
why
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
is
so
severe
to
nevada
and
this
is
true
of
all
the
other
states.
mr.
george
allison
that
is
my
understanding
of
arizona’s
position
and
i
assume
that
is
true
and
i
do
not
find
that
hard
to
believe
because
if
the
justices
are
familiar
with
the
state
of
nevada,
the
three
populations
or
i
should
say
two-and-half
population
centers
that
we
have
are
located
in
areas
where
there
is
access
to
water
right
next
to
federally
reserved
land
and
the
underground
water
is
just
becoming
a
major
source
of
water.
that
simply
is
enough
other
water
and
there
really
is
enough
underground
water,
but
without
that
there
is
no
other
development
in
the
state
and
i
think
arizona
is
essentially
the
same
problem.
so,
it
is
not
just
farmers
--
mr.
george
allison
you
mean
--
mr.
george
allison
i
might
briefly
give
an
example
and
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
quoting
the
facts
of
this
case.
there
is
an
existing
case
in
the
state
engineer’s
office
and
there
are
some
other
ramifications
to
it,
so
i
do
not
pretend
i
know
all
the
facts,
but
there
is
a
river,
the
carson
river
that
runs
out
of
the
sierra
which
is
a
federal
reserved
forest,
that
river
runs
down
through
and
into
water
holding
area
in
lake
lohontan.
carson
city
which
is
our
capital,
does
not
have
any
other
source
of
water
right
in
the
moment
and
there
is
a
moratorium
on
building
in
carson
city.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
city
council
of
carson
city
went
to
the
next
county
to
try
to
get
water
from
wells.
the
wells
happen
to
be
next
to
the
carson
river.
the
government
has
protested
that
and
if
you
track
that
out,
the
only
legal
basis
they
have
to
protest
that
is
that
the
river
is
going
to
go
down
because
carson
city
is
pumping
water
to
supply
its
people
and
the
basis
for
that
is
that
the
carson
river
comes
off
the
federally
reserved
land,
and
therefore,
they
have
the
right,
the
priority
to
the
use
of
that
and
make
then
control
--
mr.
george
allison
because
they
own
the
land
from
the
water
comes,
because
they
reserve
the
forest.
mr.
george
allison
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
position
of
saying
that
i
know
the
government’s
argument.
you
asked
me
if
i
could
cite
you
an
example.
mr.
george
allison
yes
we
have
a
very
clear
argument
on
surface
water
and
the
pyramid
lake
in
ickes.
there
are
15,000
defendants
in
that
case,
an
indian
case.
it
is
a
very
real
problem
and
it
is
in
the
district
court
level
right
now.
i
hope
i
did
not
misstate
the
government’s
position
in
that,
but
i
think
it
applies
the
logic.
it
is
not
nevada’s
position
that
there
is
not
an
implied
right.
that
is
not
what
we
are
saying.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
doctrine
of
an
implied
reserved
right
came
out
of
the
winters’
case.
it
came
out
of
an
indian
case
and
in
that
case
they
just
did
not
say
congress
must
have
intended,
in
that
particular
case,
this
court
waived
the
competing
interests
and
that
is
how
the
doctrine
rules.
they
looked
at
what
harm
would
come
to
the
other
users
on
the
river,
on
the
surface
stream.
they
just
did
not
automatically
say
okay
there
is
an
implied
--
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
and
what
we
are
really
saying
is
that
the
federal
government
should
have
the
burden
of
establishing
very
carefully
the
importance
of
the
need,
the
extent
of
injury,
and
all
the
competing
interest
that
go
into
it
before
we
imply
an
intent.
mr.
george
allison
in
what
form?
our
position
is
that
that
should
be
in
the
initial
form
in
the
state
procedure
that
is
already
the
existing,
established
used
procedure.
mr.
george
allison
in
our
state
it
means
an
administrative
procedure
first,
subject
of
course
--
mr.
george
allison
in
a
federal
court
because
it
is
a
federal
question
and
i
think
this
is
consistent
with
this
court’s
position
in
the
eeo
case
that
came
out
of
colorado.
mr.
george
allison
yes.
mr.
george
allison
yes
and
they
filed
--
mr.
george
allison
no.
mr.
george
allison
no
sir,
my
point
is
that
there
are
really
three.
nevada
recognizes
the
implied
reservation
doctrine,
whatever
kind
of
law
we
want
to
call
that,
state
or
federal
law,
we
happen
to
grant
water
rights
to
our
citizens
by
the
appropriative
means.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
state
engineer
in
the
administrative
procedure
in
the
state
of
nevada
cannot
also
recognize
an
implied
right,
if
the
circumstances
warranted
and
that
is
all
we
are
asking
that
the
states
have
the
opportunity
to
do.
that
in
the
existing
system
of
which
all
other
water
rights
are
determined
that
they
have
the
opportunity
initially
to
determine
–-
mr.
george
allison
right.
subject
to
review
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
george
allison
well,
that
is
a
state
district
court.
mr.
george
allison
yes.
mr.
george
allison
well,
yes
really.
yes.
yes,
it
will
be
a
direct
review
by
this
court
on
certiorari,
that
is
right.
mr.
george
allison
yes,
well
the
argument
that
we
have
expressed
in
that
particular
case
because
we
expressed
it
in
a
district
court
is
at
that
point,
i
even
conceding
those
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
they
did
have
jurisdiction
because
it
was
the
federal
government.
in
this
particular
case
of
course,
we
have
the
additional
problem
of
the
fact
that
they
did
appear
in
an
administrative
proceeding
and
not
as
alluded
to
in
their
brief,
they
just
did
not
appear
as
a
friend
of
the
engineer.
they
appeared
and
advocated
as
strongly
as
they
could
and
that
if
for
no
other
reason
in
this
particular
case,
they
raised
you
to
code
of
principle
or
the
collateral
stuff
of
principle
should
be
applied.
mr.
george
allison
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
allison
well,
they
were
a
party
--
mr.
george
allison
no,
mr.
justice
i
do
not
think
it
is
that
easy
because
i
do
not
think
you
say
they
appeared,
they
cross-examined,
they
presented
witness,
they
orally
argued
on
opening,
and
they
orally
argued
closing.
i
think
that
is
a
party.
every
time
i
appear
for
a
party
that
is
all
the
things
that
i
do,
but
they
claim
they
are
not
a
party.
mr.
george
allison
what
was
the
title
of
the
case?
well,
the
way
it
arose
was
that
the
cappaerts
filed
an
application
to
appropriate
underground
water.
at
the
time
that
that
is
filed,
the
government
filed
protest
on
the
basis
that
the
pumping
would
reduce
the
water
level
on
devil’s
hole.
pursuant
to
our
procedure
which
is
an
administrative
procedure,
a
hearing
was
set,
a
formal
hearing
at
which
the
state
engineer
presided.
at
that
time,
the
government
presented
their
evidence.
everything
they
had,
presented
witnesses,
presented
the
proclamation
--
mr.
george
allison
your
honor,
government
side
--
mr.
george
allison
the
state
of
nevada,
united
states
government,
and
cappaert.
mr.
george
allison
well,
it
is
not
a
suit.
i
think
the
question
is
you
are
a
real
party
in
interest
if
you
have
a
vital
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
george
allison
it
definitely
was
not
a
court
action,
it
was
administrative
hearing,
but
the
result
is
the
same.
mr.
george
allison
the
united
states
government
was
not
much
a
party
as
anybody
else,
no
question
about
that
in
my
mind.
mr.
george
allison
i
think
they
did
not
quite
go
so
far
as
advocate,
at
least
the
solicitor
general
representative
did
not
go
quite
so
far
as
advocate
that
was
a
legal
right.
they
felt
that
it
was
a
fact
that
it
should
be
considered
by
the
state
engineer
and
they
at
that
time
did
not
have
sufficient
evidence
and
said
well,
we
would
like
you
to
weigh,
however,
they
did
introduce
the
proclamation
and
by
inference,
by
reading
the
transcript,
i
think
they
alluded
to
the
fact
that
was
their
legal
basis
and
that
really
it
was
their
right,
although
the
government
counsel
did
not
make
an
extended
argument
that
way.
mr.
george
allison
he
ruled
to
the
extent
that
he
indicated
that
there
was
a
reference
to
a
federal
right
and
in
his
opinion
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
establish
one.
that
was
three
or
four
lines
in
his
decision.
mr.
george
allison
yes,
i
think
they
could
have,
yes,
i
think
they
could
have.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
quote
you
a
precedent
for
that,
but
i
do
not
know
of
have
any
reason,
nor
i
cannot
pick
a
case
out
right
now.
mr.
george
allison
yes,
i
assume
again
that
to
be
consistent,
they
could
then
come
directly
to
the
united
states.
even
then
i
think
all
the
machinery
is
there
right
now
without
even
a
ruling
from
this
court.
mr.
george
allison
they
want
to
abide
by
it.
mr.
george
allison
yes
sir.
mr.
george
allison
that
is
what
came
out
of
the
winters
case.
mr.
george
allison
yes.
mr.
george
allison
right.
mr.
george
allison
yes.
mr.
george
allison
the
law
in
my
opinion
is
the
winters
case
set
down
by
this
court
and
that
is
an
implied
right
and
an
implied
right
in
this
very
nature
involves
weighing
the
circumstances
to
find
what
they
intended.
i
think
that
is
the
law.
it
is
not
a
state
--
mr.
george
allison
i
do
not
know
if
it
makes
any
difference
if
they
call
it
a
federal
principle
or
state
principle.
it
is
not
the
system
that
we
used
under
the
appropriation
method.
it
is
not
the
riparian
doctrine
and
as
i
indicated
in
my
brief,
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
third
way
that
has
been
set
forth
by
this
court
to
establish
a
water
right.
mr.
george
allison
yes,
right.
it
is
another
way
--
mr.
george
allison
yes,
it
is
an
addition.
now,
instead
of
one
way,
we
have
two
ways
in
the
state
of
nevada
to
establish
a
water
right.
mr.
george
allison
no,
not
really
in
the
procedure
that
they
go
about
it
because
the
underground
water
refers
back
to
the
surface
water
statute
and
the
procedure
of
finding
the
application
and
getting
the
determination
by
the
state
engineer
is
essentially
the
same.
if
there
is
a
difference
to
some
extent
in
that,
once
you
receive
a
permit
you
also
have
to
establish
a
period
of
beneficial
use.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
put
it
to
use
to
determine
the
amount
that
you
are
entitled
to.
you
just
do
not
get
them
and
use
it
at
all.
mr.
george
allison
yes.
mr.
george
allison
well,
not
for
purposes
of
implied
reservation
doctrine.
i
concede
only
that
the
hydrologist
tells
me
that
there
is
a
cycle
that
they
are
going
to
relate
it,
but
i
know
that
you
cannot
determine
from
the
surface
where
the
underground
water
is
and
if
you
cannot
determine
whether,
like
i
said
as
an
example
in
this
case,
i
am
quite
confident
that
president
truman
or
none
of
the
people
that
were
involved
in
invoking
this
proclamation
were
any
or
as
near
aware
of
the
connection
of
the
underground
water
in
that
basin.
and
so
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
how
you
can
go
back
and
say,
well,
they
must
have
intended
to
do
certain
things,
if
you
cannot
determine
from
the
surface
where
it
is.
now,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
solution
to
that,
that
is
not
an
impossible
burden.
certainly,
we
have
enough
technology
that
the
government
can
determine
before
they
make
a
reservation
as
to
what
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
groundwater
is
and
what
the
connections
are
and
all
we
are
saying
is
that
that
is
one
burden
that
they
should
meet
before
the
can
imply
an
attempt.
mr.
george
allison
yes
with
two
questions.
i
am
not
asking
you
to.
we
accept
the
winters
doctrine
and
the
implied
reservation
doctrine
as
an
addition
to
creating
a
right
in
the
state
of
nevada.
the
pelton
dam
case
in
my
opinion
is
distinguishable
and
their
reasoning
on
the
reserved
right
i
do
not
think
was
complete
and
i
think
that
case
could
have
been
decided
--
mr.
george
allison
well,
i
accepted
because
the
case
--
mr.
george
allison
no,
from
the
state
of
nevada
standpoint,
i
am
not
and
i
did
not
understand
that
that
was
a
question
in
the
case.
mr.
george
allison
we
are
definitely
not.
yes,
i
think
we
have
always
assumed
that
it
was
a
national
monument.
