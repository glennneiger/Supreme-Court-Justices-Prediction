justice
blackmun
this
proclamation
did
refer
to
a
pool,
is
it
not?
justice
blackmun
so
there
is
something
said
about
water?
justice
blackmun
when
did
the
cappaerts
get
to
acquire
their
property?
justice
blackmun
1967?
justice
blackmun
i
suppose
what
you
really
want
is
the
government
to
condemn
this
interest
if
the
government
wants
it?
justice
blackmun
mr.
allison
would
you
expand
on
that
a
little
bit.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
why
the
states
are
so
exercise
in
this
case,
is
it
because
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
sure
about
your
position?
this
balancing
of
the
respective
interest
whatever
they
may
be?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
you
say
is
the
technique
that
should
be
applied?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes
and
that
is
what
you
should
--
you
say
should
have
happened
in
the
first
instance
in
your
administrative
proceeding?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
if
the
united
states
was
properly
in
the
united
states
district
court
as
apparently
it
was
under
the
head
of
jurisdiction
as
the
one
that
brought
the
suit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
same
technique
should
be
the
governing
one
to
determine
these
respective
rights,
is
that
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
what
is
the
law?
state
law
or
is
it
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
but
the
principles
whether
they
apply
in
your
state
tribunals
or
courts
or
in
the
federal
court
or
what,
federal
principles
whether
are
state
principles?

blackmun
