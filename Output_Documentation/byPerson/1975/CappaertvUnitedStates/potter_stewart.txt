justice
potter
stewart
the
first
rule
of
law
to
which
you
refer
i.e.
that
while
reserving
the
land,
the
united
states
back
as
in
the
late
19th
century,
1877,
ceded
jurisdiction
over
nonnavigable
waters
to
the
states.
does
this
means
jurisdiction
to
the
term
on
the
rights
of
the
waters
under
state
law,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
cede
the
waters
to
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
public,
are
you
saying
that
it
also
ceded
or
conveyed
or
gave
up
to
the
federal
property?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
what
public,
the
federal
public
or
population
of
the
states?
justice
potter
stewart
but
prior
in
1877,
the
federal
government
under
your
submission
or
prior
at
least
to
sometime
of
that
19th
century,
the
federal
government
and
the
territories
had
jurisdiction
over
the
land
and
the
water
to
apply
its
federal
law
to
the
ownership
of
the
land
and
water
and
also,
do
you
concede,
had
ownership
of
both
land
and
water?
justice
potter
stewart
jurisdiction
to
determine
who
did
on
the
water,
was
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
who
had
the
water
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
jurisdiction
to
determine
that,
but
no
rights
in
and
off
themselves,
except
the
right
to
decide,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
fact
that
the
western
states
do
not
apply
the
right
riparian
rule,
they
apply
the
appropriation
rule,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
give
me
another
example
where
a
so
called
prior
reserved
right
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
states?
justice
potter
stewart
besides
this
case,
i
could
understand
how
it
operates
in
this
case,
but
just,
using
--
setting
aside
a
national
forest
or
something
like
that,
there
usually
who
does
not
imply
reserving
any
water
other
than
what
the
falls
on
it
and
runs
on?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
the
case
was
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
under
what
head
of
jurisdiction
because
the
plaintiff
was
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
would
it
be
you
position
that
clearly
there
was
a
statutory
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
federal
court
to
take
the
case
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
federal
court
to
apply
nevada
law,
that
i
suppose
would
be
what
follows
from
your
brother’s
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
cession
of
jurisdiction
over
these
waters
back
in
the
19th
century,
that
the
state
of
nevada
determine
it
within
its
--
under
its
law
that
even
the
federal
court
should
sort
of
by
analogy
to
erie
railroad
v.
tompkins
kind
of
situation
would
have
a
duty
to
apply
nevada
law,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
was
in
a
federal
district
court
by
reason
of
very
explicit
jurisdictional
statute,
is
that
not
right
that
the
united
states
was
the
plaintiff?
justice
potter
stewart
but
suppose
as
--
under
--
it
has
been
imposed
upon
state
law,
has
it
not
as
an
addition
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
an
addition
to
your
prior
appropriation
or
qualification
or
whatever?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
sound
like
a
very
rosy
future
if
each
was
one
inch
long—[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
--
dying
within
a
year.
justice
potter
stewart
at
this
point
in
time,
this
just
goes
back
to
the
date
of
the
presidential
proclamation?
