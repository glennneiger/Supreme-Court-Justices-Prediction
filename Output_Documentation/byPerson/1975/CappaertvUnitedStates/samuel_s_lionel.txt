mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
dramatic
features
of
both
fact
and
law,
but
it
can
be
decided
on
a
narrow
basis.
factually,
this
case
presents
a
contest
between
two
endangered
species.
on
the
one
hand,
the
individual
farm
operator
of
the
united
states
whose
numbers
decline
no
less
than
40%
between
the
years
1959
and
1969
and
on
the
other
hand
a
species
of
fish
known
as
cyprinodon
diabolis.
cyprinodon
is
also
known
as
pupfish
and
it
inhabits
the
death
valley
area
of
nevada
and
california.
there
are
many
species
of
pupfish,
five
of
which
in
1970
were
declared
to
be
endangered.
cyprinodon
diabolis
has
a
life
span
of
approximately
one
year
and
at
maturity
it
is
almost
one
inch
in
length.
its
numbers
have
been
stabilized
for
several
years
now
at
several
hundred.
legally,
this
case
presents
a
contest
between
two
disparate
rules
of
law,
both
formulated
by
this
court.
the
first
which
was
in
effect
between
the
years
1935
and
1955
laid
down
that
the
congress
by
the
desert
land
acts,
no
later
than
1877
severed
the
land
and
the
water
in
the
western
arid
states
and
then
territories
and
ceded
all
jurisdictions
over
nonnavigable
water
in
the
public
domain
to
those
states
and
territories.
the
other
which
was
first
espoused
in
1955
by
this
court
and
later
extended
and
expanded
laid
down
that
when
the
united
states
reserved
a
land
in
the
public
domain,
it
could
also
reserve
water
if
there
was
intent
to
reserve
water
and
such
intent
could
be
implied.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
it
did
not.
it
said
it
belonged
to
the
public
and
to
be
given
as
provided
by
the
states
and
under
the
laws
of
the
several
states.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
in
the
california
power
cases
court
said
that
the
congress
by
those
acts
had
severed
land
from
the
water
and
that
the
water
then
would
belong
to
the
public
to
be
given
out
as
provided
by
the
several
states.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no.
in
other
words,
that
the
states
had
jurisdiction
and
control
over
that
water
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
states
involved
to
determine
water
rights
to
that
water
and
as
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
those
several
states.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
concede
that
at
some
point,
the
federal
government
had
ownership
of
both
land
and
the
water,
but
the
california
power
case,
that
doctrine
enunciated
there
said
by
1877
at
the
latest
there
was
a
severance
of
water
and
land
and
jurisdiction
ceded
to
the
states.
there
were
series
of
desert
land
acts.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
no,
jurisdiction
to
determine
who
was
entitled
to
the
water.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
right
to
beneficial
use
of
that
water.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
it
said
it
belonged
to
the
public
and
to
be
given
out
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
several
states
interpreted
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct,
precisely.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
in
substance
yes,
but
said
that
the
state
was
still
free
to
use
whatever
the
states
felt
should
be
used
by
that
state
for
the
water
in
the
public
domain
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct.
now,
in
the
view
of
the
cappaerts,
the
owners
of
a
large
farm
in
nevada,
neither
question
need
be
determined,
but
this
case
can
be
decided
on
a
more
narrow
basis
by
giving
consideration
to
the
reservation
of
public
land
here
involved
and
the
effect
given
that
reservation
below
and
i
will
show
that
there
are
five
cumulative
reasons
why
the
judgment
below
does
not
properly
flow
from
that
reservation.
briefly,
in
january
1952
and
that
date
is
significant
and
i
will
recur
to
it
later
in
several
connections.
in
january
1952
the
president
reserved
a
40-acre
tract
of
land
in
order
to
preserve
a
pool
of
water
known
as
devil’s
hole
in
nevada.
the
proclamation
described
that
pool
as
being
a
remarkable
underground
one
and
of
outstanding
scientific
importance
of
then
interests.
there
was
nothing
in
that
proclamation
about
water
and
yet
on
the
strength
of
that
proclamation
that
cappaerts
have
been
enjoined
from
pumping
water
on
21
square
miles
which
is
effectively
their
entire
fall
and
as
a
matter
of
economics
will
utterly
destroy
their
business
enterprise
and
how
is
such
result
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
yes,
but
it
refers
to
it
as
being
a
remarkable
underground
pool.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
water
in
there.
the
word
water
never
occurs.
how
was
this
result
justified
below?
because
said
both
courts
here,
pumping
from
this
21
square
miles
of
your
farm
will
endanger
this
pupfish
which
by
reason
of
later
legislation,
a
legislation
many
years
after
the
withdrawal
have
been
deemed
to
be
endangered,
and
therefore,
entitled
to
special
protection.
as
i
said
before,
i
will
show
five
cumulative
reasons
why
this
result,
this
conclusion
was
unjustified
and
wrong.
first,
the
terms
of
the
proclamation
do
not
support
the
effect
given
to
it
below.
that
proclamation’s
text
appears
on
pages
c1
to
c3
and
the
cappaert's
petition
for
certiorari,
that
is
a
small
very
blue
book.
the
proclamation
reserves
40
acres
containing
this
pool.
it
explains
why
the
pool
known
as
devil’s
hole
is
of
remarkable
scientific
importance
and
interest.
it
does
not
say
that
about
the
pupfish.
the
proclamation
states
that
the
pool
should
be
afforded
special
protection.
the
pupfish
referred
to
only
in
a
fourth
of
five
preambles
and
then
only
as
further
confirming
geologic
evidence
of
the
importance
of
the
pool.
i
stress
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
the
level
of
water
in
the
pool.
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
the
pool
is
of
great
depth,
no
one
knows
the
depth.
they
know
it
much
more
than
200
feet.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
interfere?
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
the
level
of
water
fluctuates
every
day
by
reason
of
various
things.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
it
does
not
take
water
out
of
the
pool.
it
is
only
for
hydraulic
reasons
that
the
pumping
of
wells
on
the
cappaert’s
property
affects
the
level
of
that
water.
we
are
not
taking
any
water
out
of
that
pool.
the
cappaerts
pump
water
under
their
own
land.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it
will
affect
the
water
level
because
of
the
hydraulic
relationship
between
our
wells
and
the
pool.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
will
not
agree,
it
will
take
out
the
water.
the
effect
of
our
pumping
will
be
to
reduce
the
level,
but
our
pumping
is
not
reaching
their
water.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes,
yes
sir.
i
stress
geologic
evidence
because
there
is
nothing
in
that
proclamation
saying
that
the
fish
are
biologic,
zoological
or
ethologic
evidence
of
any
kind.
there
was
nothing
in
the
proclamation
saying
that
the
pupfish
were
of
scientific
importance
other
than
as
being
such
confirming
geologic
evidence.
there
is
nothing
in
that
proclamation
which
says
that
the
pupfish
warrant
preservation
and
yet
the
denial
of
the
cappaerts
right
to
pump
on
21
square
miles
rested
on
that
proclamation.
i
come
now
to
the
second
reason
why
the
judgment
below
is
wrong
and
that
is
because
it
involves
judicial
ex
post
facto
action.
as
i
stated
before,
the
proclamation
dates
from
january
1952
and
yet
the
first
act
of
congress
providing
for
endangered
species
did
not
come
into
being
until
october
1966,
fourteen-and-half
years
later
and
it
was
not
until
october
of
1970
that
these
pupfish
were
declared
endangered
species.
that
was
18
years
and
nine
months
after
this
proclamation
which
was
construed
below
to
warrant
the
destruction
of
the
cappaerts
ranch
and
all
without
compensation.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
they
started
farming
there
in
1967.
they
acquired
shortly
before.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
1967
and
approximately
half
the
land
was
acquired
in
exchange
with
the
government
in
1969.
cappaerts
acquired
other
land
which
they
traded
to
the
government
and
at
the
time
they
traded
it,
in
determining
the
value
of
the
land
being
acquired
from
the
government
part
of
their
ranch,
it
was
predicated
on
the
basis
that
cappaerts
would
be
able
to
pump
water.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
an
obvious
way.
as
a
matter
of
fact
implied
reservation
doctrine
has
often
been
called
a
financial
doctrine
that
enables
the
government
under
that
doctrine
to
acquire
water
from
people
who
had
not
paid
for
it.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
we
do
not
argue
with
estoppel
in
this
court.
we
did
below.
all
of
the
endangered
species
provide
for
condemnation
of
lands
required
to
preserve
endangered
species,
provides
for
the
condemnation
of
land,
land
rights,
interest
in
lands
in
the
1973
with
respect
to
water
there
can
be
condemnation.
i
turn
now
to
third
reason
why
the
judgment
below
is
wrong
and
that
stems
from
the
legislation
of
which
we
have
--
the
withdrawal
affected
by
the
proclamation
rested.
the
sole
authority
cited
in
the
proclamation
is
the
1906
act
for
the
preservation
of
the
american
antiquities
that
authorizes
a
reservation
of
warrant,
excuse
me,
that
authorize
a
reservation
of
land
in
certain
instances
to
become
national
monuments.
it
does
not
authorize
withdrawal
or
reservation
of
warrant.
the
history
of
that
act,
the
legislative
history
and
it
is
voluminous,
demonstrates
that
it
was
sponsored
by
a
consortium
of
archaeological
societies
who
were
seeking
congressional
approval
for
the
preservation
and
gathering
of
these
artifacts
and
objects
of
antiquities
which
were
then
being
uncovered
in
southwestern
part
of
the
united
states.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
precisely.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
they
can.
maybe
there
must
be
other
authority
for
the
federal
government
to
do
it,
but
clearly
not
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
any
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
i
am
not
arguing
at
this
point
that
the
preservation
of
devil’s
hole
could
not
have
--
would
not
be
justified
under
the
1906
act.
my
point
is
that
the
1906
act
would
not
authorize
the
reservation
of
land
and
concomitant
ration
of
water
under
an
implied
reservation
doctrine
with
--
because
of
the
fish
in
there
and
that
is
the
government’s
contention
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
deals
with
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
within
the
meaning
of
the
1906
act
because
the
entire
intent
of
that
act
is
to
deal
with
artifacts,
prehistoric
artifacts.
indeed
the
title
of
that
act,
the
acts
for
the
preservation
of
american
antiquities
so
indicates.
the
act
provides
for
the
gathering
of
these
artifacts
and
placing
them
in
museums
for
permanent
preservation
and
the
cappaerts
asked
how
does
one,
placed
in
a
public
museum
for
permanent
preservation,
a
fish
with
a
lifespan
of
less
than
one
year.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
if
one
could
say
that
it
was
an
artifact
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
an
artifact
is
probably
man-made.
i
would
say
that
some
would
be
prevalent,
the
1906
act
would
authorize
the
creation
of
a
national
monument
to
preserve
that.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
yes
it
was
and
that
is
cameron
in
252
u.s.
which
i
am
aware.
now,
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
grand
canyon
was
an
object
of
scientific
importance
and
interest
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
surely,
it
is
not,
i
agree
with
that
and
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
opinion
indicating
that
this
court’s
attention
was
directed
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1906
act
and
i
have
since
read
the
briefs
in
that
case,
which
represent
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
briefs
that
called
the
court’s
attention
to
the
history
of
1906
act
in
cameron.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
in
cameron,
this
court
was
not
concerned
with
whether
or
not
the
act
could
be
used
with
respect
to
living
creatures.
it
was
purely
natural
phenomenon.
now,
the
fourth
reason,
why
this
judgment
is
wrong
also
rests
on
the
terms
of
the
authorizing
statute.
the
house
report,
the
debate,
and
indeed
the
express
terms
of
the
act
provide
that
withdrawals
of
land
under
it
shall
be
limited
to
the
smallest
area
compatible
with
the
proper
care
and
maintenance
of
the
objects
to
be
protected.
let
us
see
what
we
have
here.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
a
40-acre
tract
reserved,
as
a
matter
of
interest,
that
is
protected
by
a
barbwire
with
only
vips
and
the
zoological
world
are
allowed
to
go
to
devil’s
hole
and
see
what
is
there,
provide
the
national
park
service
will
permit
them
entry
and
on
the
other
hand,
in
consequence
of
that
40-acre
reservation
of
land,
the
cappaerts
have
been
enjoined
effectively
from
pumping
on
21
square
miles
of
the
land.
now,
thus
far,
i
have
restricted
myself
to
speaking
about
the
21
square
miles
where
the
cappaerts
have
been
enjoined
from
pumping,
but
based
on
the
expert
testimony
in
this
record,
pumping
in
an
area
of
4500
square
miles,
the
size
of
the
groundwater
basin
here
involved
called
anacapa
will
in
time,
affect
the
level
of
the
water
in
devil’s
hole.
no
one
knows
when,
no
one
knows
where,
but
this
water
just
percolates
and
seeps
under
the
earth
in
no
defined
paths,
little
droplets
going
under
the
ground
and
as
shown
by
the
record,
the
experts
were
unable
to
predict.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
expert
said,
here
if
we
have
two
wells,
one
adjacent
to
the
other.
pumping
under
one
may
affect
the
level
of
the
water
in
devil’s
hole
pumping
in
the
other
may
not.
thus,
if
the
decision
below
is
affirmed,
this
40-acre
withdrawn
may
control
pumping
in
an
area
of
4500
square
miles
and
that
is
the
land
area
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
now,
the
cappaerts
do
not
have
to
conjure
a
possibilities,
probabilities
or
imaginable
horribles.
the
amici
do
that
and
counsel
for
the
state
of
nevada
will
explain
to
this
court,
the
difficulties
the
states
will
have
in
administering
their
water
laws
if
this
case
is
affirmed.
it
is
enough
for
the
cappaerts
to
point
to
the
final
decree
in
this
case
in
which
they
have
been
enjoined
from
pumping
21
square
miles
in
the
lines
of
a
withdrawal
of
only
40
acres
and
that
based
on
the
authority
of
a
statute
which
says,
withdrawals
from
the
public
domain
shall
be
of
the
smallest
piece
of
--
a
parcel
of
land
possible.
how
great
a
conversion,
a
conversion
of
legislative
or
congressional
intent
can
we
have?
the
cappaerts
say
that
congress
just
did
not
authorize
the
wide
ranging
impairment
of
ownership
affected
and
approved
below.
i
come
now
to
the
fifth
reason
why
the
judgment
below
is
wrong
and
that
is
the
failure
of
the
courts
below
to
consider
the
proclamation
in
its
setting,
they
consider
the
proclamation
in
its
setting,
the
legal
setting.
as
our
brief
shows,
the
law
of
this
court
between
1935
and
1955,
the
jurisdiction
over
nonnavigable
water
in
the
west
had
been
ceded
to
the
several
states
and
territories.
it
was
not
until
1955,
the
federal
power
commission
versus
oregon
that
any
question
arise
with
respect
to
the
session
of
jurisdiction
over
that
water.
and
it
was
not
until
1963
in
arizona
versus
california
that
the
implied
doctrine
with
respect
to
--
implied
reservation
doctrine
with
respect
to
federal
enclaves
was
first
announced
and
even
in
that
case,
it
dealt
with
navigable
water,
the
colorado
river
not
nonnavigable
water.
now,
as
nevada
says
and
nevada
is
an
arid
land
state
indeed,
i
hope
this
court
will
reaffirm
the
earlier
doctrine
and
sharply
limit
the
implied
reservation
doctrine,
but
as
counsel
for
the
cappaert,
i
need
not
and
i
do
not
go
that
far.
it
would
be
sufficient
if
this
court
would
view
that
controlling
proclamation
in
the
legal
climate
which
existed
at
the
time
it
was
signed
and
consider
it
in
the
light
of
the
law
as
it
was
at
that
time
and
as
everyone
understood
the
law
to
be.
as
we
show
in
the
brief,
the
sovereign
doctrine
was
first
comprehensively
formulated
by
this
court
in
1935.
it
was
reaffirmed
in
ickes
versus
fox
in
1937.
both
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
we
say
the
indian
reserve
--
there
was
an
indian
case
and
we
think
they
should
not
be
considered
in
the
same
light
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
let
me
tell
you
what,
mr.
justice
white.
we
think
the
indians
are
wards
of
the
court.
this
court
has
said
so
many
times
and
if
the
government
wants
to
reserve
land,
it
should
reserve
water,
if
it
does
have
power
to
do
so.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
the
indian
reservation
cases
came
into
be
because
of
treaties
made
by
the
government
with
the
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
because
they
said
it
would
be
unjust
and
unfair
for
the
government
to
not
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
all
it
said,
and
in
fact
it
did
not
say
they
were
interested
in
the
pupfish,
did
not
say
the
pupfish
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
but
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
there
was
no
authority
we
say
under
the
1906.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
and
of
course
we
are
showing
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
not
with
respect
to
a
reservation
by
the
government
for
the
government’s
purposes
out
of
the
public
domain.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct
and
the
other
one
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
it
had
been
indian
land
in
the
public
domain,
but
the
larger
portion
abutted
on
the
water.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
it
might
very
well
have
been.
at
any
rate
both
those
decisions
were
unanimous
by
this
court
and
they
reaffirmed
in
later
cases
and
in
may
of
1951,
this
court
in
dority
versus
new
mexico
which
it
dismissed
for
lack
--
for
one
of
a
substantial
federal
question
and
did
so
on
the
basis
of
the
california
power
case.
thus
this
dority
case
was
only
eight
months
prior
in
time
to
the
date
of
the
proclamation
and
if
the
california
power
doctrine
was
a
law
of
this
court
which
it
clearly
was
and
everyone
understood
it
to
be,
jurisdiction
over
the
water
in
the
west
had
been
ceded
to
the
several
states,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
water
to
reserve,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
way
that
united
states
or
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
president
acting
for
the
united
states
could
have
intended
to
reserve
water
and
intention
is
to
touch
tone
of
the
implied
reservation
doctrine.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
i
try
to
differentiate
between
the
pool
and
the
pupfish
because
it
is
clearly
the
intention
was
to
preserve
the
pool,
preserve
the
pool,
that
is
not
necessarily
my
position,
but
i
say
that
we
are
only
talking
--
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
under
law,
that
is
true
because
of
the
session
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
well,
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
say
that
they
can
have
water,
that
they
may
be
a
beneficial
use
because
of
its
being
a
natural
phenomenon.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
that
is
clearly
and
the
law
of
nevada
would
not
grant
a
permit
for
someone
to
drill
and
pump
that
this
would
affect
the
beneficial
use
by
someone
else
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
which
will
arise
by
an
affirmance
of
this
case
as
it
will
be
shown
by
counsel
for
the
state
of
nevada.
mr.
samuel
s.
lionel
i
have
30
minutes,
he
has
15
minutes.
i
note
that
i
do
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
