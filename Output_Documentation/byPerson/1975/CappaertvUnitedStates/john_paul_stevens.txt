justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
the
fish
are
not
an
object
of
historic
or
scientific
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lionel,
let
me
be
sure
i
have
your
position
correct.
you
are
saying
that
in
february
of
1952,
somebody
bought
land
right
outside
the
40-acre
tract,
dug
a
well
and
drained
the
water
out
and
reduced
the
water
level
within
the
pool
that
would
not
have
been
inconsistent
with
the
president’s
intention,
that
is
what
i
understand
your
argument
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
that
you
say
they
could
have
done
that
in
february
1952,
they
could
have
drained
the
water
out
of
the
pool
if
they
stayed
outside
the
40-acre
tract,
that
is
what
i
understand
your
argument
to
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lionel,
suppose
the
(inaudible)
water
rights,
gets
adjudicated
at
least
in
state
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying
that
in
accordance
with
the
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
argue
apparently
that
the
government
has
always
had
this
pool
set
aside
and
it
never
given
it
to
arizona,
what
about
it?
it
would
not
have
qualified
as
an
appropriate
use
under
the
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say,
at
least
it
would
be
determined
by
state
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allison,
did
the
government
take
the
position
that
they
oppose
the
reduction
of
the
water
level
because
that
was
the
factor
that
should
be
weighed
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
grant
the
permit
or
do
they
take
the
position
that
legally
they
had
a
right
to
object
because
the
own
water
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
engineer
rule
on
that
issue,
the
legal
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
allison,
one
more
question
and
maybe
i
should
ask
your
opposition
this.
in
the
u.s.
code,
section
431,
following
it
is
a
list
of
national
monuments
in
the
proclamation
under
which
they
were
established.
i
have
reviewed
it
several
times.
i
do
not
find
this
particular
monument
listed.
is
this
of
any
significant?
you
are
not
raising
any
question
that
this
is
not
a
national
monument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
think
it
is
but
i
was
curious
and
maybe
mr.
lionel
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
randolph,
does
the
record
tell
us
why
the
government
reserved
40
acres,
i
take
it
the
pool
is
only
65
feet
long?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
is
it
conceivable
to
take
out
mr.
lionel’s
argument
that
this
is
the
area
from
which
the
president
intended
to
exclude
wells,
thinking
this
would
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
pool?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
areas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
randolph,
if
there
is
no
interest
in
protecting
the
rocks,
why
did
they
need
40
acres?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
going
to
explain
to
me
why
it
is
unreasonable
to
assume
that
that
was
the
area
from
which
it
was
attended
to
exclude
wells?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
they
had
done
what
i
suggest
to
mr.
lionel
and
dug
a
well
just
41
acres
away,
whatever
the
distance
would
be,
could
he
not
then
have
increased
the
size
of
the
monument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
protect
it
that
way?
