justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
repudiated
the
riparian
concept
in
the
west,
unless
it
were
to
be
adapted
by
the
individual
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
expectations
of
the
cappaerts,
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
against
you,
are
they
not,
insofar
as
any
representations
by
the
government
were
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
located
a
dead
dinosaur,
they
could
have
reserved
the
area,
but
not
a
live
dinosaur?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
--
but
the
grand
canyon
was
--
the
reservation
of
grand
canyon,
was
that
not
based
on
the
1906
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
it
is
not
man-made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
not
true
counsel
that
in
the
winters’
case
which
i
guess
is
the
leading
indian
reservation
case,
there
had
been
an
earlier
grant
by
the
indians
to
the
government
of
a
much
larger
territory
and
then
a
grant
back
of
a
smaller
area
as
an
indian
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
not
fall
by
your
answer
justice
stevens'
question
as
to
whether
they
could
pump
right
outside
the
pool
by
saying,
if
the
law
of
nevada
permitted
them
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gather
from
the
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
arizona
that
the
city
of
tucson
is
entirely
dependent
on
underground
water,
pumped
water
not
just
for
irrigation,
but
for
domestic
water
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
you
say
that
federal
courts
thought,
what
is
the
normal
procedure
for
a
review
of
your
engineer’s
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
then
to
the
supreme
court
of
nevada.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
do
you
not
really
mean
that
the
only
federal
court
that
would
be
reviewing
would
be
this
court
on
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
they
do
if
anything
for
humanity,
mr.
randolph?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about,
you
know,
i
mean,
the
fact
that
there
are
a
number
of
graduates
who
maybe
interested
in
the
archaeological
history,
there
may
be
a
perfectly
useful
human
occupation,
but
is
there
anything
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
given
the
water
table,
certainly
that
requirement
could
be
a
proscription
against
pumping
if
the
water
table
gets
low
enough?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing
mr.
cappaert
turns
on
those
pumps
that
are
covered
by
the
injunction
and
the
special
master
learns
that
the
water
in
the
pool
diminishes
down
below
the
three
--
of
the
three-foot
mark,
then
how
is
the
mandate
of
the
injunction
carried
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
it
does
not
recover
for
several
weeks
that
is
a
proscription
against
pumping
for
several
weeks,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
and
if
it
is
a
critical
time
for
irrigating
a
crop
not
being
able
to
pump
for
several
weeks,
maybe
the
same
is
not
being
able
to
pump
all
year?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
a
record
citation
for
that
statement
you
just
made
that
that
it
is
just
an
area,
just
a
few
miles
from
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
these
all
under
the
antiquities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
your
argument
partially
assumes
that
the
other
way
because
they
left
the
unreserved
part
over
and
above
the
40
acres
open
to
patent
and
people
came
in
and
either
got
patents
or
it
was
exchanged?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
do
you
reconcile
what
these
cases
you
have
just
cited
in
your
description
of
the
holding
with
the
statement
from
beaver
versus
portland
cement
that
following
the
act
of
1877,
if
not
before,
all
nonnavigable
waters
then
part
of
the
public
domain
became
publici
juris,
subject
to
the
primary
control
of
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
saying
then
that
is
no
longer
good
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
because
of
pelton
dam?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
pelton
dam
represented
a
carefully
considered
repudiation
of
beaver?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
it
was
not
the
reason
in
any
way,
pelton
dam
has
about
one
paragraph?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
always
thought
beaver
was
regarded
as
the
leading
case
construing
the
desert
land
act
of
1877,
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statement
in
arizona
versus
california
was
not
really
a
very
reasoned
statement,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
is
not
a
justice
of
this
court
as
i
recall?
