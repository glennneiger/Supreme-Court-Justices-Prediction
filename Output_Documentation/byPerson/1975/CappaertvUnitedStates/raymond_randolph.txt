mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
brought
the
suit
to
prevent
the
cappaerts
from
extinguishing
nevada's
on
the
population
of
cyprinodon
diabolis,
the
devil’s
hole
pupfish.
we
contend
in
this
case
the
devil’s
hole
national
monument
was
established
in
1952
to
protect
to
the
pool
that
has
been
referred
to
and
the
fish
in
it.
that
the
water
right
of
the
united
states
is
measured
by
reference
to
that
purpose
and
that
the
cappaerts
pumping
of
water
must
be
regulated
to
ensure
that
they
do
not
interfere
with
that
united
states
water
right,
a
federal
right.
i
think
i
will
tell
the
court
a
little
bit
about
the
facts
of
this
case
and
particularly
the
circumstances
that
exist
at
devil’s
hole.
at
the
center
of
this
case
is
an
anomaly,
a
fish
that
lives
in
the
desert.
the
area
involved,
southern
nevada
near
the
california
border
and
not
very
far
from
death
valley
was
not
always
once
the
desolate
place
that
it
is
now.
thirty
thousand
years
ago
it
was
cool
and
wet,
streams,
lakes,
rivers
abounded
and
in
fact
death
valley
itself
was
a
lake
more
than
100
miles
long
more
than
600
feet
deep.
this
was
the
home
of
the
ancestors,
the
pupfish
that
live
in
devil’s
hole
today,
but
the
climate
gradually
changed,
the
glaciers
to
the
north
receded,
the
land
dried
and
the
animals
of
the
area
which
included
the
(inaudible)
all
disappeared.
somehow
however,
the
pupfish
managed
to
survive,
taking
refuge
on
what
one
writer
has
called
tiny
islands
of
water
in
the
sea
of
sand.
of
the
four
remaining
species
of
cyprinodon,
the
devil’s
hole
pupfish
has
been
isolated
the
longest.
the
scientist
that
testified
in
this
case
estimate
that
this
fish
entered
devil’s
hole
approximately
10,000
years
ago.
between
in
then
and
now,
this
tiny
fish
which
has
mr.
lionel
pointed
out
is
but
one
inch
long
has
performed
nothing
short
of
an
evolutionary
miracle,
evolving
to
its
present
status,
present
condition
today,
adapting
to
extreme
circumstances
in
what
is
evolutionary-wise
a
blink
of
the
eye.
the
pool
in
which
cyprinodon
diabolis
now
resides
is
the
smallest
sole
natural
habitat
of
any
species
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
the
fish
themselves
make
up
the
smallest
population
of
the
species
of
fish
known
to
man.
the
surface
of
this
pool
which
we
have
been
talking
about
measures
10
feet
by
65
feet.
it
is
open
to
the
sky,
but
it
is
50
feet
below
the
surrounding
land
surface.
all
but
the
western
end
is
bordered
by
sheer
rocks.
the
water
temperature
is
a
constant
92
degrees
fahrenheit
year
round.
the
entire
structure
of
devil’s
hole
and
the
pool
was
once
a
limestone
cavern.
the
geologist
testified
that
years
ago
the
roof
of
the
cavern
collapsed,
perhaps
by
the
dissolving
action
of
the
water
inside,
sending
rocks
down
to
the
bottom
as
mr.
lionel
said
more
than
200
feet
below,
divers
have
gone
down
to
at
least
200
feet
in
devil’s
hole,
but
no
one
knows
the
exact
depth.
but
one
piece
of
rock,
not
very
much
larger
than
this
table
here,
about
9
feet
wide
at
its
widest
and
perhaps
16
feet
long
wedged
below
the
surface
of
the
pool
to
form
a
natural
shelf.
in
the
summer
months,
sunlight
reaches
the
shelf
and
about
one
half
of
the
pool
itself
only
for
a
few
hours
a
day
allowing
algae
and
other
small
organisms
to
grow
there.
in
the
winter,
they
are
only
shadows
and
the
alga
dies.
the
pupfish
as
the
district
courts
specifically
found
are
totally
dependent
on
this
natural
shelf.
they
spawn
there,
they
feed
there
and
when
the
alga
dies,
a
great
part
of
the
pupfish
population
dies
with
it,
only
hopefully
to
recover
again
the
following
spring.
it
is
a
precarious
existence,
but
the
pupfish
have
been
successful
for
it
for
10,000
years.
these
fish,
remarkable
fish
are
unable
to
tolerate
extreme
temperature
changes
and
ranges
in
salinity
up
to
six
times
that
of
seawater,
but
ever
since
the
first
study
of
them
began
in
1936,
they
have
been
subjects
of
intense
scientific
interest.t
here
are
dozens
of
studies
in
this
either
in
the
record
in
this
case
or
referred
to
by
the
witnesses
in
this
case
and
all
of
them
relating
to
the
pupfish.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
let
me
read
what
dr.
fister,
who
was
one
of
the
biologists
that
testified
mr.
justice.
on
page
157
of
the
appendix,
i
am
reading
from
it
now.
as
a
research
potential,
he
says,
these
again
and
he
is
talking
about
the
fish,
have
almost
unlimited
future.
right
now,
i
know
of
any
number
of
graduate
students
who
would
just
literally
give
anything
to
have
an
adequate
number
of
fish
to
use
for
experiments
at
the
doctoral
level
to
go
through
and
do
research
papers.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes.
let
me
continue.
at
the
bottom,
at
page
157,
he
talks
philosophically,
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
that,
but
at
the
bottom
of
page
157,
he
says
that
if
this
specie
does
become
extinct
and
heaven
forbid,
we
can
never
bring
it
back
for
all
the
expertise
we
developed
ecologically.
prior
to
that,
on
page
157,
he
says
these
species,
these
little
animals,
they
may
very
well
hold
the
key
to
our
future
as
human
beings
as
they
learn
to
adapt
to
the
changes
in
their
own
habitat,
just
as
we
are
having
to
do
for
our
own
polluted
waters
and
our
own
smog
and
so
on.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
do
not
think
we
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
this
case
is
about
the
extinction
of
species
of
fish.
i
notice
at
one
point
in
the
testimony
that
mr.
lionel
said,
well,
is
it
not
true
doctor,
i
think
it
was
another
doctor,
dr.
deacon
(ph)
that
this
fish
will
become
extinct
and
dr.
deacon
said,
yes
that
is
true
and
so
homosapiens,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
exhilaration
of
the
process.
and
i
think
that
is
relevant
and
i
think
it
is
relevant
on
page
158
what
dr.
fister
says
that
it
is
impossible
to
judge
the
value
of
these
fish.
there
is
intent
studies
going
on
now.
genetic
studies,
biological
studies,
studies
by
fish
experts
to
determine
precisely
what
it
is
that
caused
this
fish
to
adjust
unlike
any
other
species
in
the
world.
what
they
are
worth
to
us
in
2072
cannot
be
measured
by
what
we
know
even
today
at
this
point.
i
do
not
think
any
great
scientific
breakthrough
has
come
from
them
yet.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
think
the
surrounding
area
of
the
rocks
and
everything,
the
directive
in
the
act
was
to
reserve
the
smallest
area
consistent
with
maintaining
it.
if
you
reserve
just
the
pool,
obviously
could
not
put
a
fence
around
it
and
i
think
this
was
just
a
discretionary
judgment
by
the
president
as
he
has
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
conceivable
and
i
will
explain
why
later
in
my
argument.
because
of
their
vulnerability,
there
have
been
numerous
attempts
to
raise
the
pupfish
to
transplant
them
between
1947
and
1972.
there
were
10
attempts,
all
the,
failed,
there
is
a
reference
in
the
record
here
to
a
later
attempt
at
hoover
dam
which
at
one
point
looked
like
it
might
work,
but
all
the
scientist
testified
that
they
could
not
qualify
it
as
a
success.
it
started
out
with
24
pupfish,
by
the
time
the
case
had
reached,
june
1973,
there
are
a
170
pupfish
in
this
small
aquarium
in
the
hoover
dam
and
i
notice
and
i
distributed
to
the
court
the
latest
report
of
the
special
master
which
has
attached
to
it
a
report
of
dr.
deacon
which
points
out
that
the
pupfish
population
at
hoover
dam
is
dwindling.
it
is
now
down
to
65.
one
reason
for
this
is
population
threshold
and
i
think
this
is
important
to
this
case.
the
minimum
population
needed
for
specie
to
survive
indefinitely,
24
cyprinodon
diabolis
may
not
be
enough
and
the
scientists
have
testified.
in
breeding
occurs
because
of
the
lack
of
genetic
variation.
the
past
inter
fusion
is
an
example
as
one
of
the
biologist
testified
in
this
case,
although
thousands
of
them
were
left
after
they
have
been
haunted.
they
were
below
their
minimum
population
threshold
level
and
despite
efforts
to
preserve
them,
they
died
off.
that
was
the
testimony
in
the
record
that
some
scientists
believe
they
are
blue
whale
for
example
has
reached
that
point.
the
threshold
level
of
devil’s
hole
pupfish
obviously
cannot
be
known
until
it
is
too
late.
the
testimony
in
the
record,
some
scientists
believe
that
it
was
somewhere
between
100
and
200
fish.
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
natural
shelf
at
the
devil’s
hole
is
crucial
to
the
existence
of
the
pupfish
and
this
of
course
is
essential
that
it
be
covered
with
water.
despite
the
remarkable
ability
to
adapt
to
changing
circumstances,
the
one
thing
that
the
pupfish
has
not
learned
to
adapt
to
is
the
absence
of
water.
at
the
normal
level,
the
shelf
is
fully
submerged.
it
is
1.2
feet
below
a
copper
washer
which
is
used
as
a
marker
and
was
installed
by
the
national
park
service
in
1962.
the
cappaerts
began
pumping
water
in
1968.
yearly,
they
were
taking
out
in
this
area
2
billion
281
million
gallons
of
water
for
their
ranch
in
the
desert.
the
evidence
that
shows
incidentally
that
some,
but
not
all
of
their
wells
are
hydraulically
connected
with
devil’s
hole.
as
they
pumped
over
the
years,
the
water
level
in
devil’s
hole
dropped
and
in
turn
the
natural
shelf
began
to
be
exposed.
in
1970,
the
natural
shelf
was
46%
covered
although
it
had
been
100%
before
the
pumping.
by
1971,
the
shelf
became
only
21%
covered
with
water.
by
june
of
1972,
when
the
first
hearing
of
this
case
was
held,
the
natural
shelf
was
covered
only
with
10
to
15%
with
water.
the
usual
summer
population
of
pupfish
at
devil’s
hole
is
about
700.
in
1961,
it
reached
a
high
between
june
--
in
june
between
200
and
300
fish,
less
than
half
of
that
that
had
been
in
existence
before
the
pumping
started,
it
did
slightly
better
in
1972
going
up
to
about
400,
but
i
notice
in
the
latest
special
master's
report
that
is
before
the
court
now,
that
last
year
in
1975,
the
highest
pupfish
population
reached
was
about
294.
the
evidence
shows,
therefore,
and
the
district
court
found
that
it
is
necessary
to
maintain
the
water
level
at
devil’s
hole
so
it
covers
the
shelf.
that
is
3
feet
below
the
copper
marker.
this
is
the
only
way
to
have
a
continuing
viable
population
there
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
ordered.
now,
mr.
lionel
in
his
argument
talked
about
being
prevented
from
pumping
on
21
square
miles
of
his
ranch
that
is
not
accurate.
number
one,
with
respect
to
the
wells
that
were
under
the
injunction
in
this
case,
he
is
not
prevented
from
pumping.
they
are
only
pumping
--
their
pumping
has
to
be
regulated
so
they
do
not
drop
the
water
level
between
3.0
feet.
mr.
lionel
said
in
his
opening
statement
and
i
quoted
this
that
“the
injunction
in
this
case
utterly
destroys
his
business
enterprise.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
to
that
effect.”
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
would
refer
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
special
master's
reports,
one
of
which
i
filed
which
shows
the
hours
of
pumping
from
the
wells
at
the
cappaerts
ranch.
it
is
not
a
proscription
against
pumping
and
i
might
point
out
while
i
am
talking
about
this
that
some
of
the
wells
in
the
ranch
are
not
even
covered
by
the
injunction.
the
reason
is
that
the
hydrologist
who
testified
for
the
federal
government
in
this
case
said
they
were
not
hydraulically
connected
with
devil’s
hole,
even
though
they
were
about
a
few
miles
from
devil’s
hole.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
he
has
to
stop
pumping
until
the
water
level
recovers.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
am
talking
on
a
yearly
basis.
some
days,
he
may
not
be
able
to
pump,
on
other
days,
he
may
be
able
to
pump.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
that
may
be.
that
may
be,
but
the
injunction
nevertheless
does
not
say
mr.
cappaert,
incidentally
the
farmers
are
who
live
in
vicksburg,
mississippi
and
when
i
referred
to
them.
i
am
not
referring
that
they
are
doing
the
pumping,
it
is
people
that
run
the
ranch
with
them,
it
does
not
say
that
they
cannot
pump.
it
says
that
you
cannot
pump
to
a
certain
extent
and
beyond
that,
mr.
lionel
refers
to
the
21
square
miles
of
ranch.
the
court
examines
the
decree
in
this
case,
it
does
not
cover
the
entire
ranch.
there
is
a
great
portion
in
northwest
section
in
this
ranch
that
is
not
covered
by
the
injunction.
the
reason
is
that
although
it
is
a
few
miles
away,
it
is
not
hydraulically
connected
with
devil’s
hole.
it
is
served
by
another
system
in
the
aquifer,
and
therefore,
pumping
there
will
not
have
any
effect
on
devil’s
hole.
while
i
am
on
this
topic,
i
notice
throughout
the
brief
that
mr.
cappaert
filed
--
that
mr.
lionel
filed
for
mr.
cappaert
and
also
through
the
state
of
nevada;
they
talk
about
this
40-acre
tract
controlling
45
hundred
square
miles
of
an
aquifer
that
by
reserving
just
40
acres,
the
united
states
has
thereby
served
the
authority
of
a
4500
square
miles
aquifer,
that
is
not
so.
the
testimony
in
the
record
and
i
will
give
the
court
the
citation
so
that
you
can
look
at
them
up,
at
appendix
page
79,
the
government’s
expert
talked
about
the
aquifer
in
this
4500
square
miles
and
i
think
and
i
believe,
i
am
looking
at
it
now
that
mr.
lionel
was
cross-examining,
and
he
said
if
there
was
substantial
pumping
for
example
from
the
site,
40
miles
northeast
of
devil’s
hole,
the
ground
would
have
moves
from
the
northeast
towards
devil’s
hole,
what
effect
would
that
have?
well,
over
a
period
of
decades,
there
maybe
a
small
effect.
pumping
at
another
site
40
miles
away
at
the
rate
of
2000
gallons
a
minute
which
is
28
million
gallons
a
day,
would,
the
hydrologist
testify,
this
is
again,
after
a
period
of
time,
have
a
slight
perhaps
indiscernible
effect
on
the
water
level
at
devil’s
hole.
at
page
80
of
the
appendix,
(inaudible)
well
was
referred
to,
but
15miles
to
north
of
devil’s
hole.
testimony
was
unconnected,
that
is
not
connected
in
any
way
with
devil’s
hole.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
you
could
pump
there
all
you
want.
at
page
98
and
99,
there
is
further
testimony,
i
will
not
go
into
it,
but
the
point
is
as
the
hydrologist
testified
at
page
99
of
the
appendix,
if
you
get
any
considerable
distance
away
from
the
devil's
hole,
“the
amount
of
recharge
was
base
and
would
pick
up
between
the
center
of
pumping
in
devil’s
hole
would
replenish
it,
it
would
not
have
any
kind
of
discernible
effect
on
devil’s
hole.”
we
are
talking
about
an
area
directly
involved
in
this
case
and
area
surrounding
devil’s
hole
and
area,
but
just
a
few
miles
on
it.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes,
the
map
that
the
defendant’s
exhibit
'i'
is
the
location
of
the
wells
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
sorry?
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
between
i
think
two-and-half
miles
is
for
this
one
mr.
justice
stevens.
now,
first
of
all,
let
me
deal
with
the
first
argument
that
petitioners
make
in
this
case
which
relates
to
the
act
to
preserve
american
antiquities.
an
antiquity
incidentally
is
something
belonging
to
a
dating
from
the
time
long
past
and
i
think
the
pupfish
qualify
for
that.
but
as
petitioners
have
indicated,
the
devil’s
hole
national
monument
was
set
aside
by
president
truman
in
1952
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
appendix
to
43
u.s.c.
or
16
u.s.c.
431
does
not
include
all
the
national
monuments.
i
think
it
is
a
sampling
and
i
do
not
know
the
sampling
by
which
they
were
selected,
but
there
are
any
number
that
are
not
in
there,
including
i
think
the
grand
canyon
as
a
matter
of
fact.
is
it
there?
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
because
the
way
the
act
is
mr.
justice,
the
way
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
the
pupfish
themselves
and
i
will
relate
that
if
i
can
first
talk
about
the
act
and
then
the
proclamation.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
that
is
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
no,
antiquity
means
something
from
the
past
relating
to
the
past.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
no,
antiquity,
not
antique.
now,
that
act
authorizes
the
president
in
his
discretion
to
reserve
public
land
for
preservations
of
objects
of
historic
or
scientific
interest.
petitioners
say
that
under
this
act
there
could
be
no
monument
to
protect
the
pool
and
the
fish
in
it.
it
is
hardly
clear
why?
pupfish
are
certainly
objects
of
scientific
interest.
the
cappaerts
in
their
brief
and
i
notice
in
their
arguments
also
say
that
the
act
extends
only
to
artifacts
appropriate
for
preservation
in
public
museums.
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
grand
canyon
is
a
national
monument
and
was
held
to
be
properly
so
in
cameron
and
i
do
not
know
if
any
museum
that
could
hold
it,
the
c&o
canal
is
a
national
monument,
not
very
far
from
here.
mr.
lionel
talks
about
the
act
as
preserving
only
dead
objects
i
suppose.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
may
be
familiar
with
this,
the
sonoran
national
monument
south
of
phoenix
was
set
aside
in
1933
and
i
quote
from
the
presidential
proclamation
there
because
of
“the
exceptional
growth
thereon
of
various
species
of
cacti,
there
are
other
national
monuments
that
preserve
living
things,
the
buck
island
reef
national
monument
in
the
virgin
islands,
the
oregon
pipe
cactus
national
monument
also
in
arizona,
the
joshua
tree
national
monument
in
california
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
they
are.
it
is
we
submit
untenable
to
say
that
under
an
act
for
the
preservation
of
objects
of
scientific
interests,
the
president
of
the
united
states
could
create
a
monument
to
protect
the
pupfish
only
after
they
have
died
and
become
fossilized,
but
that
is
precisely
what
mr.
lionel’s
argument
leads
to.
now,
as
far
the
proclamation
is
concerned,
we
believe
it
clearly
indicates
that
devil’s
hole
monument
was
set
aside
to
preserve
the
pool
and
the
pupfish
in
it.
it
is
difficult
we
think
to
read
it
in
any
other
away.
president
truman
was
not
acting
to
protect
the
rocks
in
this
case.
the
proclamation
he
referred
to
geologic
data,
but
he
also
refer
to
on
page
c2
of
the
appendix
from
which
mr.
lionel
quoted
that
said
pool
is
of
such
outstanding
scientific
importance
that
it
should
be
given
special
protection.
the
pool
is
of
outstanding
scientific
importance
not
because
of
the
rocks
surrounding
it,
but
because
the
unique
species
of
fish
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
living
it.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
i
think
it
fairly
does
mr.
justice.
the
preceding
paragraph
when
it
refers
to
the
scientific
importance
of
the
pool,
the
paragraph
proceeding
that
states
that
the
presence
in
this
pool
of
a
peculiar
race
of
desert
fish
and
zoologist
have
demonstrated
this
race
of
fish
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
involved
only
a
gradual
drying
up,
more
or
less
the
statement
of
facts
that
i
just
had
given
the
court,
we
think
indicates
that
scientific
interest
of
that
pool
is
the
fish
in
it.
and
if
you
remove
the
fish,
you
extinguish
the
scientific
interest
in
the
pool.
the
record
in
this
case
is
replete
with
studies,
scientific
studies.
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
them.
there
is
not
a
single
study
that
i
know
of
in
this
record
and
i
stand
correct
if
i
am
wrong
that
relates
to
the
devil’s
hole
by
a
geologist
in
some
way
unrelated
to
the
pupfish.
every
study
that
is
either
referred
to
or
in
this
record
is
because
of
the
pupfish.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
that
was.
you
know,
there
were
scientific
interests
who
know
whether
they
were
going
to
require
to
set-up
some
kind
of
a
building
there
to
study
the
fish.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
think
that
when
president
truman
set
this
aside,
i
think
the
area
surrounding
it
was
public
land.
at
that
time,
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
necessary
so
far
as
it
appears
in
1952;
there
was
no
indication
that
there
were
any
wells
in
that
area.
there
was
no
necessity
for
him
to
have
to
gobbled
up
a
great
big
chunk
of
land
because
there
were
no
wells.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
think
so
by
condemnation,
but
i
will
talk
about
it
later,
well,
maybe
i
will
mention
it
now,
i
think
the
condemnation
argument
is
sort
of
red
herring
in
this
case.
the
fact
is
when
this
was
set
aside
in
1952,
there
was
nothing
to
condemn.
to
say
now,
as
mr.
lionel
says,
well,
you
can
--
what
you
want
to
do
is
take
our
rights
by
condemnation
is
to
assume
the
very
issue
in
this
case
that
are
against
the
united
states,
they
have
some
rights
to
take.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
you
have
a
stream
as
in
the
winters
case,
as
in
arizona
versus
california,
as
in
eagle
county,
any
of
those
cases,
united
states
reservation
whether
indian
or
non-indian
on
a
piece
of
land
that
is
adjacent
to
the
stream
in
any
way.
if
you
follow
this
theory
what
it
means
is
that
in
order
to
prevent
somebody
upstream
from
the
diverting
water
and
depriving
water
that
you
source
you
will
have
to
take
all
the
stream.
in
other
words,
you
should
take
the
entire
stream.
the
court
has
never
held
that.
arizona
versus
california
is
to
the
contrary,
eagle
county
is
to
the
contrary.
the
winters
case
itself
is
to
the
contrary.
powers
which
is
another
indian
case
to
sought
of
this
court
on
the
reservation
doctrines
to
the
contrary.
the
pelton
down
case
is
to
the
contrary.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
number
one,
that
was
dictum.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
oh!
no,
absolutely
not!
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
do
not
think
it
was
repudiation.
the
court
even
cites
beaver
and
i
think
you
can
find
other
statements
in
the
california
oregon
power
case
that
there
are
inconsistent
with
the
statement
you
just
cited.
i
read
the
briefs
in
that
case
and
the
government’s
briefs
and
i
think
it
was
carefully
considered
yes.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes,
because
if
you
read,
first
of
all
if
you
read
the
desert
land’s
act,
it
says
nothing
about
separating
the
water,
the
water
from
the
land
or
anything
like
that,
it
does
not
say
that
at
all.
all
it
says
is
that
with
respect
to
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states,
the
people
are
entitled
to
get
a
water
right
pursuant
to
state
law.
the
statement
in
the
case
that
mr.
lionel
relies
upon
was
just
a
statement
in
regard
to
that.
it
was
not
the
act.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
in
this
case,
if
you
are
talking
about
public
land,
if
you
are
talking
about
somebody
establishing
a
water
right
on
public
land
and
the
public
domain,
i
would
say
absolutely
yes.
if
you
are
talking
about
reserve
rights
and
land
that
is
not
in
the
public
domain
like
devil’s
hole,
i
would
say,
no,
it
is
not
and
pelton
dam
is
--
if
you
follow
the
beaver
case,
look
at
what
you
would
have
to
overrule.
you
would
have
to
overrule
arizona
versus
california.
you
would
have
to
overrule
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
judge
simon
rifkin
was
special
master
for
that.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
and
justice
black
i
think
followed
precisely
with
judge
rifkin
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
sorry?
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
well,
i
think
after
presiding
over
arizona
versus
california
he
became
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
that
argument
is
incidentally
the
same
argument
was
made
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
that
is
right.
pelton
is
inconsistent
with
the
indian
case
because
how
could
--
how
could
the
united
states
--
in
1897
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
do
not
cite
it
for
the
desert
lands
act.
i
cite
it
for
the
reserved
rights
act.
remove
the
pupfish
as
i
said
and
you
remove
the
scientific
importance
of
this
pool
and
i
think
president
truman
understood
that
full
well.
the
president
referred
specifically
to
the
fish
as
i
have
said
and
thus
we
think
a
plain
that
and
the
courts
below
incidentally
agreed,
that
the
devil’s
hole
became
a
national
monument
not
because
of
the
rock
formation,
but
because
of
the
pool
water
in
the
desert
containing
a
remarkable
race
of
fish
that
had
been
there
for
10,000
years.
that
is
something
worth
protecting
and
preserving
and
president
truman
did
it
in
1952
and
that
question
obviously
concerns
the
reservation
doctrine
and
we
discussed
that
somewhat,
but
under
this
doctrine,
it
is
simply
that
the
united
states
by
reserving
public
lands
may
reserve
the
waters
pertinent
to
the
land,
unappropriated
waters
and
those
reasonably
necessary
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
reservation.
the
petitioner
says
that
requires
intent.
well,
we
submit
that
president
truman’s
intent
is
clear
from
the
face
of
the
proclamation.
certainly,
more
so
than
--
there
is
not
much
to
--
one
talks
about
implied
reservation
doctrine,
there
is
certainly
very
little
to
infer
in
regard
to
water.
in
president
truman’s
proclamation,
but
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
doctrine
is
hardly
is
startling
one.
it
simply
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution,
giving
the
authority
to
the
united
states
to
act
under
the
property
clause
with
respect
to
this
land
and
the
court
in
arizona
versus
california
held
that
under
this
clause
and
i
quote
“there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
reserve
water
rights
for
its
reservations
and
its
property,
that
was
1963.
in
1971,
this
court
held
and
i
emphasize
held,
this
was
not
dictum,
in
the
eagle
county
case
that
again
reaffirming
arizona
versus
california
saying
that
as
we
said
in
that
case,
the
federal
government
had
the
authority
both
before
and
after
a
state
is
admitted
into
the
union
to
reserve
waters
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
federally
reserved
lands.
the
federally
reserved
lands,
include
any
federal
enclave
as
what
mr.
justice
douglas
speaking
for
the
court
incidentally,
who
was
from
a
western
state
and
he
said
also
that
the
reservation
of
waters
may
be
only
implied
and
the
amount
will
reflect
in
the
nature
of
the
federal
enclave.
here
however,
as
i
have
stated,
there
is
very
little
to,
if
anything
to
infer,
the
reservation
of
waters.
waters
as
mentioned,
the
pool
of
waters
and
mr.
cappaert
or
mr.
lionel
has
not
really
explained
when
he
says
in
his
brief
that
that
proclamation
did
not
intend
to
reserve
one
single
drop
of
water,
how
you
can
preserve
a
pool
of
water
without
intending
to
have
water
in
it.
now,
the
fact
that
the
government
can
reserve
water
rights
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
should
hardly
be
surprising.
after
all,
the
cappaerts
are
asserting
a
water
right
against
the
united
states.
the
only
difference
here
is
that
their
right
supposedly
arises
under
state
law.
we
are
saying
that
federal
right
arises
under
federal
law.
none
of
the
parties
in
this
case
in
this
case
or
the
amici
i
might
add
have
suggested
that
the
united
states
cannot
have
water
rights
at
all.
rather
the
argument
is
that
the
united
states
should
submit
the
state
law
and
state
procedures
to
establish
them.
aside
from
the
overruling
of
cases
that
would
be
necessary
to
get
to
this
result,
it
is
simply
another
way
of
saying
there
can
be
no
united
states
water
right
in
devil’s
hole
and
the
reason
for
that
is
like
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
the
reason
for
that
is
like
most
western
states,
nevada
follows
a
doctrine
of
appropriation,
that
is
a
rule
of
capture.
you
capture
the
water,
priority
in
time,
first
come,
first
served.
it
requires
at
least
two
things;
a
diversion
of
the
water
from
its
natural
source
and
application
of
the
water
diverted
to
a
beneficial
use.
we
are
not
diverting
any
water
in
devil’s
hole.
we
are
seeking
to
preserve
it
and
i
might
add
that
under
the
usual
doctrine
of
beneficial
use,
beneficial
use
is
defined
in
state
law
as
application
things
like
irrigation
to
stock
ordering,
industrial
uses,
it
was
only
in
1969
that
nevada
amended
its
law,
a
great
movement
forward
to
allow
beneficial
use
to
mean
recreation.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
there
is
no
way
the
united
states
can
get
a
water
right
under
state
law
of
nevada.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
oh!
no!
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
absolutely,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
that
is
right.
i
rely
on
that
incidentally
mr.
justice
white.
i
rely
on
the
general
adjudication
proceeding
and
the
reason
i
rely
upon
that
is
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
the
uncertainty,
well,
this
creates
an
uncertainty.
we
do
not
know
how
much
order
the
federal
government
has.
we
do
not
know
the
connection
of
wells.
if
nevada
wants
to
end
that
uncertainty,
they
can
do
so
tomorrow.
they
can
start
a
general
adjudication
in
a
basin.
that
is
the
ash
meadows
basin
which
would
adjudicate
priorities
of
all
the
rights
of
the
people
that
are
involved
in
this
case
and
other
people
who
might
be
involved
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
make
it
absolutely
definite.
they
have
never
done
that.
they
have
the
right
to
do
it.
they
have
the
statutory
authority.
they
can
enjoin
the
united
states
in
that
proceeding
pursuant
to
the
mccarran
act,
but
it
is
still
a
federal
right
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes
that
we
have
a
water
right,
that
means
that
it
should
not
be
interfered
to
a
certain
extent.
now,
there
is
some
indication
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
presidential
proclamation.
if
there
are
other
appropriative
rights
existing
at
that
time,
you
notice
the
proclamation
says
subject
to
vested
rights,
so
all
it
takes
is
something
that
was
no
one
else
had
an
entitlement
to
it
at
that
time.
there
is
also
some
suggestion
here
that
this
case
would
--
involves
groundwater,
surface
water,
there
is
a
distinction.
the
reserve
rights
doctrine
sure
has
been
applied
the
surface
water,
but
do
not
apply
at
the
ground
water.
in
other
words,
this
suggests
the
case
would
come
out
differently
if
instead
of
being
fed
by
underground
aquifers,
devil's
hole
was
fed
by
a
surface
stream,
that
was
diverted
by
the
cappaerts
for
irrigation
purposes.
there
is
no
logical
reason
why
the
result
should
be
different.
both
situations
establish
that
the
monument
is
the
same
and
the
purpose
is
the
same.
to
reserve
sufficient
water
to
preserve
the
pool
and
the
pupfish
in
it.
both
cases
incidentally
deal
with
water
in
those
situations.
the
same
resource
and
we
quoted
in
our
brief,
i
think
at
page
32,
the
fact
of
the
interrelationship
between
groundwater
and
surface
water
cycles.
i
might
also
say
that
it
is
not
entirely
clear
to
us
that
the
devil’s
hole
is
groundwater.
it
is
a
pool,
a
standing
pool
and
it
is
open
to
the
sky.
it
might
be
considered
ground
water
in
some
regimes
and
others
that
may
be
considered
surface
water.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
just
like
a
spring
fed
lake
for
example.
they
also
say,
nevada
says
that
the
movement
of
groundwater
is
uncertain.
effect
of
pumping
from
wells
might
not
be
known
for
years
and
well
users
could
invest
money
only
to
have
them
realize
years
later
that
they
were
affecting
someone
else’s
right,
in
which
case,
they
would
have
to
stop
pumping.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
oh
yes!
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
yes.
the
procedure
in
nevada
is
it
can
be
done
on
the
petition
from
the
water
rights
owners
or
upon
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
with
the
state
engineer
or
--
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
or
on
the
state
engineer’s
own
initiative
if
sees
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
i
think
the
word
is
inter
cc
(ph),
he
would
determine
the
rights
of
the
various
pumpers
and
people
vis-à-vis
each
other
who
has
priority,
who
has
junior
right
so
and
so
forth.
mr.
raymond
randolph
jr.
and
the
united
states
is
subject
to
that
under
the
mccarran
act.
they
could
enjoin
the
united
states
if
any
at
all.
as
far
as
this
uncertainty,
the
fact
is
that
that
is
true
under
nevada
law
too.
if
you
got
a
water
right,
a
permit
to
pump
it
may
not
be
years
--
until
years
later
that
you
find
out
that
you
are
interfering
with
somebody
else
down
the
road
and
that
is
not
the
reason
for
denying
the
united
states
the
right.
moreover
the
fact
of
this
case
is
that
hydraulic
connection
between
the
eight
wells
of
the
cappaerts
in
devil’s
hole
was
shown
and
shown
conclusively.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
june
of
1973,
the
cappaerts
finally
stipulated
to
the
fact
that
they
regulate
the
water
level
in
devil’s
hole
by
pumping
from
their
wells.
i
have
already
talked
about
condemnation
as
an
argument
and
i
think
that
it
is
adequately
answered.
that
it
assumes
the
issue
in
the
case,
that
is
that
they
have
a
right
as
against
the
united
states,
even
though
they
did
not
come
on
to
this
property
until
1967
and
starting
pumping
that.
as
far
as
res
judicata
which
i
notice
is
alluded
to
in
the
brief
by
both
parties
in
this
case,
but
was
raised
below,
if
it
all
anybody,
the
nevada
state
of
nevada.
this
decision
of
the
state
engineer
was
not
res
judicata
with
respect
to
the
united
states.
the
state
law
requires
the
state
engineer
to
decide
this
and
give
a
permit
for
pumping
subject
to
existing
rights.
this
is
a
suit
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
had
existing
rights
and
the
state
engineer
when
he
decided
this
case
said
and
you
find
at
the
very
end
of
the
proceedings,
this
permit
is
given
subject
to
existing
rights.
indeed
the
cappaerts
do
not
even
have
according
to
the
record
in
this
case
any
water
right
perfected
in
nevada
now.
all
they
have
is
a
permit
to
pump
and
so
far
as
the
record
shows
they
are
never
gone
back
and
got
a
certificate
of
appropriation
which
would
give
them
a
vested
right
under
nevada
law.
moreover,
there
were
only,
out
of
the
eight
wells
involved
in
this
case,
there
were
only
two
of
those
wells
were
pumped
and
drilled
after
this
case
was
begun
in
1972.
they
were
not
even
part
of
this
proceeding
before
the
state
engineer.
beyond
that
their
areas
of
the
ranch
that
were
not
involved
beyond
that
the
injunction
applies
to
future
wells.
we
do
not
think
that
the
decision
of
the
state
engineer,
an
engineer
trained
in
hydraulic
mattes
was
an
adjudication
of
the
government’s
right
in
this
case.
there
was
one
mention
of
a
federal
order
right
in
devil’s
hole,
but
that
was
not
mentioned
by
mr.
cappaert’s
counsel,
not
by
the
government
and
as
they
said
in
that
case
at
the
time
the
government
was
conducting
studies
to
find
out
the
hydrology
of
the
area
and
i
think
as
even
the
cappaert’s
counsel
said,
no
matter
what
we
decide
in
this
water
proceeding
now,
this
proceeding
for
a
permit,
those
studies
will
go
on,
so
there
is
no
need
to
wait
for
them
and
they
did
go
on.
and
six
months
later,
the
united
states
determined
that
cappaert’s
were
responsible
for
lowering
the
order
level
in
devil’s
hole
and
that
is
why
we
brought
this
suit.
therefore,
we
suggest
and
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
