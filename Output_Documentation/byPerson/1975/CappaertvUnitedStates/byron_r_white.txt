justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
blame
you
for
not
wanting
to
consider
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
the
indian
reservation
cases?
justice
white
i
know,
but
nevertheless
you
set
aside
the
land
and
all
of
the
sudden
the
federal
government
claims
some
water
rights
in
connection
with
them
and
it
is
held
that
they
intended
to
do
so
when
they
reserved
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
case
said
that
we
cannot
imagine
if
the
government
did
to
intend
to
reserve
some
water
because
they
did
not
want
--
they
certainly
did
not
--
they
certainly
realized
the
indians
needed
some
water
to
live
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
this
proclamation
said
we
are
interested
on
that
--
in
that
--
among
other
things
we
are
interested
in
that
pool
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
through
with
the
fish
yet,
i
am
to
the
water
and
that
is
what
the
argument
is.
we
are
arguing
about
the
level
of
water
in
this
case
and
if
there
were
not
any
pupfish
in
it
at
all,
i
suppose
it
could
be
argued
that
under
the
proclamation,
the
government
was
in
essence
maintaining
that
pool
which
it
said
was
a
unique
pool?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
not
be
there
if
it
disappeared?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
argument,
but
i
am
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
that
it
was
a
--
you
are
saying
that
first
time
that
anybody
ever
heard
of
the
reserve
water
idea
was
in
1955?
i
am
just
suggesting
that
they
have
heard
of
it
in
the
indian
reservation
cases
long
before
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
an
indian
reservation
is?
justice
white
how
about
the
(inaudible)?
justice
white
at
some
points,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
claiming
they
have
some
rights
in
the
water,
downstream
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
way,
you
have
other
argument
in
your
states
with
the
government
over
reserved
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
asking
us
to
overturn
the
oregon
case
or
the
winters
case.
you
accept
the
doctrine
in
general
of
applied
reservation
of
water
right
that
is
overlaid
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
on
state
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
colleague
here
suggested
this
whole
issue
should
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
state
law
entirely,
but
i
gather
that
you
seem
to
accept
the
implied
reservation
doctrine
in
some
forms
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
because
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
case
says
that
it
exists?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
he
did
not
cite
pelton,
i
mean
he
never
--
justice
byron
r.
white
pelton
never
presided
the
indian
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
is
there,
you
should
rely
on
arizona
against
california,
and
cite
pelton?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
the
united
states
were
noticed
into
nevada
waterhearing
to
adjudicate
its
right,
it
would
not
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
in
such
a
proceeding,
your
right
would
be
measured
by
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
which
is
what
the
eagle
river
case
is
saying?
