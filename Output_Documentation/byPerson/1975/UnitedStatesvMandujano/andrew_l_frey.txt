mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
affirmed
that
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
suppressing
for
use
in
evidence
in
respondent’s
perjury
prosecution,
the
testimony
that
he
gave
before
a
grand
jury.
in
march
of
1973,
officer
cavalier,
a
san
antonio
policeman
who
was
assigned
to
undercover
narcotics
duty
heard
that
respondent
was
involved
in
heroine
transactions.
and
on
the
afternoon
of
march
29,
he
went
to
the
bar
at
which
respondent
was
employed
and
attempted
to
purchase
heroine
from
respondent.
respondent
made
several
phone
calls
to
try
to
locate
some
heroine
apparently
unsuccessfully
and
then
suggested
that
the
officer
give
him
$650.00
and
he
would
go
out
and
attempt
to
procure
an
ounce
of
heroine.
about
an
hour
later,
respondent
returned
to
the
bar
and
said
he
had
been
unable
to
procure
the
heroine
and
returned
the
money.
but
said
that
his
regular
connection
would
be
by
later
in
the
day
and
if
that
the
officer
called
back
that
evening,
he
would
be
able
to
get
some
heroine.
the
officer
did
call
that
evening
but
respondent
was
out.
he
was
unable
to
reach
him
and
he
thereupon
dropped
the
matter
at
that
time.
during
the
month
of
april,
a
grand
jury
was
being
planned
to
investigate
into
narcotics
traffic
in
the
san
antonio
area.
and
in
connection
with
the
planning
for
the
grand
jury,
officer
cavalier
was
asked
for
any
suggestions
for
witnesses
who
might
be
called
before
the
grand
jury.
cavalier
told
the
prosecutor
about
his
aborted
heroine
transaction
with
the
respondent.
noted
that
he
believed
respondent
had
a
regular
source
for
heroine
and
that
respondent
was
apparently
aware
of
several
other
sources
whom
he
had
attempted
to
call.
accordingly,
the
prosecutor
determined
that
respondent
might
be
able
to
provide
the
grand
jury
with
valuable
information
about
local
narcotics
traffic.
as
the
prosecutor
later
testified
without
contradiction
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court,
he
had
no
intention
whatsoever
at
that
time
of
indicting
respondent
for
any
narcotics
offenses,
at
least
in
part,
because
he
did
not
realize
that
respondent
had
committed
any
offenses.
respondent
was
subpoenaed
and
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
on
may
2nd,
1973.
at
the
outset
of
his
appearance
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
prosecutor
who
was
conducting
the
grand
jury
and
respondent.
during
the
course
of
which
respondent
was
three
times
advised
that
he
was
not
required
to
answer
questions
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
him.
page
6
of
the
appendix
for
example,
the
prosecutor
said
“you
do
not
have
to
answer
questions
which
would
incriminate
you.
all
other
questions
you
have
to
answer
openly
and
truthfully.
and
of
course
if
you
do
not
answer
those
truthfully,
in
other
words
if
you
lie
about
certain
questions,
you
could
possibly
be
charged
with
perjury.
do
you
understand
that?”
and
respondent
said,
“he
did
understand.”
then
the
subject
of
the
lawyer
came
up
and
that
matter
was
summarized
by
the
prosecutor
to
respondent
essentially
as
follows.
“if
you
would
like
to
have
a
lawyer,
this
is
again
on
page
6
of
the
appendix.
he
cannot
be
inside
this
room.
he
can
only
be
outside.
you
would
be
free
to
consult
with
him
if
you
so
chose.
now
if
during
the
course
of
this
investigation,
the
questions
that
we
asked
you
if
you
feel
you
would
like
to
have
a
lawyer
outside
to
talk
to,
let
me
know.”
“yes
sir,”
said
the
respondent.
“is
that
clear?”
and
respondent
nodded
affirmatively.
now,
in
order
to
lay
a
foundation
for
broader
questions
designed
to
illicit
the
names
of
drug
traffickers
in
the
san
antonio
area
with
whom
respondent
may
have
had
dealings
and
to
gauge
the
truthfulness
of
subsequent
responses
to
those
questions.
the
prosecutor
asked
a
number
of
questions
covering
in
part
ground
already
known,
including
the
incident
with
officer
cavalier.
respondent
while
admitting
some
use
of
heroine,
denied
knowing
the
names
of
any
local
heroin
traffickers
except
someone
whose
first
name
he
could
supply.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
is
on
bottom
of
page
5,
top
of
page
6.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
of
course
is
a
matter
of
debate.
i
can
only
for
purposes
of
the
statement
i
read
to
you
what
was
said.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
a
subsidiary
issue
if
you
get
pass
the
question
of
whether
any
warning
is
required
then
there
would
be
question
as
the
adequacy
of
the
warnings
that
were
given.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
when
he
was
first
told
that
you
are
required
to
answer
all
the
questions,
i
ask
you
accept
for
the
ones
that
you
feel
would
tend
to
incriminate
you,
do
you
understand
that?
he
said,
do
i
answer
all
the
questions
you
ask?
the
prosecutor
said
you
have
to
answer
all
the
questions
except
for
those
you
think
will
incriminate
you
in
the
commission
of
a
crime.
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
concluding
that
he
did
not
understand,
although
it
is
a
matter
of
speculation
what
exactly
he
thought
that
meant
since
he
himself
did
not
say
it
back
to
the
prosecutor
what
he
understood
it
to
mean.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
the
appendix
does
not
reveal
any
substantial
difficulty
in
understanding.
although,
of
course
under
our
argument,
even
if
he
did
not
understand
that
would
not
be
critical
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
testimony
that
he
gave.
in
any
event,
respondent
admitted
some
past
use
of
heroine
but
he
denied
having
discussed
with
anyone
during
the
past
year,
the
procurement
of
heroine
or
having
taken
any
money
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
procure
some.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
he
had
not
at
that
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
prosecutor
explained
that.
that
is
at
page
45
of
the
appendix.
he
was
asked
why
he
did
that
and
his
answer
at
the
bottom
of
page
45.
i
do
not
believe
we
subpoenaed
any
witness
but
we
did
not
have
an
existing
body
of
knowledge
about.
and
then
virtually
every
case,
we
would
ask
questions
about
the
facts
that
we
did
have.
that
was
number
one,
a
method
to
gauge
the
truthfulness
of
the
person’s
testimony
and
number
two,
was
in
the
nature
of
a
natural
progression
to
result
in
answers
to
the
ultimate
question.
a
simple
example
of
that
might
be
if
a
person
is
a
heroine
addict,
he
obviously
has
to
have
a
source
of
supply
and
you
would
say
are
you
an
addict
and
his
answer
might
be
yes,
the
natural
question
to
follow
that
would
be
who
do
you
purchase
heroine
from?
it
seems
to
me
quite
logical
to
establish
a
foundation
for
the
grand
jury’s
crediting
his
testimony
to
cover
the
background
and
show
the
nature
of
his
contacts
and
his
dealings
in
the
transaction.
and
of
course,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
he
would
not
have
been
indicted
although
one
may
say
that
that
is
specular
have
he
cooperated
with
the
grand
jury
because
the
grand
jury
was
looking
at
major
traffickers,
the
people
who
were
his
connections,
his
sources.
in
any
event,
he
denied
both
having
talked
about
the
procurement
of
heroine
and
having
taken
any
money
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
get
heroine.
and
the
prosecutor
warned
him
that
according
to
the
information
the
prosecutor
had,
he
could
tell
the
grand
jury
more
than
he
was
telling
them.
respondent
denied
having
any
further
knowledge
in
this
area.
prosecutor
then
was
preparing
a
perjury
indictment
against
respondent
and
in
the
course
of
that
he
was
unclear
whether
according
to
his
testimony
again
whether
it
should
be
returned
in
one
count
or
three
since
they
were
three
false
answers.
he
discussed
that
with
another
attorney
in
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
who
pointed
out
to
him
that
respondent’s
actions
might
also
constitute
an
attempt
under
the
narcotics
statute
and
the
prosecutor
decided
at
that
time
according
to
his
testimony,
to
add
the
attempt
charged
to
the
indictment
and
that
was
done.
the
district
court
granted
respondent’s
motion
to
suppress
his
grand
jury
testimony.
he
found
that
respondent
had
been
a
putative
defendant
at
the
time
he
was
called
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
that
as
such
his
questioning
before
the
grand
jury
must
be
deemed
custodial
interrogation.
therefore,
the
district
court
concluded
he
was
entitled
to
full
miranda
warnings.
since
he
did
not
receive
the
full
warnings
the
questioning
was
improper
and
his
answer
should
be
suppressed
from
any
use
including
as
here
from
forming
the
basis
of
a
perjury
charge.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
he
adapted
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
the
respondent
was
a
putative
defendant
that
therefore
his
interrogation
was
custodial
and
he
was
entitled
to
full
miranda
warnings.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
reflects
what
we
view
as
a
rather
disturbing
approach
toward
the
function
of
the
grand
jury
and
one
that
we
think
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
views
expressed
on
numerous
occasions
by
this
court.
while
the
requirement
imposed
that
simply
the
giving
of
miranda
warnings,
the
opinion
reflects
a
basic
hostility
to
the
practice
of
calling
as
a
grand
jury
witness
persons
who
according
to
information
on
the
government’s
possession
have
some
involvement
in
the
activities
under
investigation.
for
instance,
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
at
page
15(a),
the
court
says
this
is
toward
the
top
to
the
certiorari
petition
that
is
correct,
i
am
sorry.
in
order
to
deter
the
prosecuting
officers
from
bringing
a
putative
or
virtual
defendant
before
the
grand
jury
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
incriminating
and
perjurious
testimony,
the
accused
must
be
adequately
apprised
of
his
rights
for
all
of
his
testimony
incriminating
and
perjurious
will
be
suppressed
and
at
page
19(a)
the
entire
proceedings
which
led
up
to
mandujano’s
indictment
for
perjury
where
as
we
have
noted
repeatedly
beyond
the
pale
of
permissible
prosecutorial
conduct.
we
conclude
that
the
entire
proceeding
was
a
violation
of
mandujano’s
due
process
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
same
theme
is
echoed
in
united
states
against
wang
which
is
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
which
there
is
a
pending
certiorari
petition.
now,
ostensibly
the
court
of
appeals
is
talking
about
cases
in
which
a
witness
is
called
for
the
purpose
of
getting
him
to
incriminate
himself
or
perjury
himself
but
the
application
of
its
strong
language,
the
facts
of
this
case
reflect
how
far
its
holding
really
goes
in
practical
application.
now,
we
submit
that
the
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
strikes
at
the
heart
of
the
effective
functioning
of
the
investigator
grand
jury.
that
body
is
in
that
capacity
attempting
to
ferried
out
secret
crime.
how
can
they
do
this
without
obtaining
the
cooperation
of
those
persons
who
have
at
least
some
peripheral
involvement
in
the
criminal
activity
under
investigation?
in
the
san
francisco
investigation
of
police
corruption,
a
person
such
as
rose
wang
who
was
apparently
involved
in
gambling
activities
and
thought
to
have
made
payoffs
to
police,
is
the
very
kind
of
person
whose
cooperation
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
grand
jury.
here
a
person
like
mandujano
who
is
tied
into
major
heroin
dealings
in
the
san
antonio
areas,
a
person
whose
cooperation
is
vital
to
the
success
of
the
grand
jury’s
undertaking.
we
should
be
encouraging
rather
than
discouraging
the
voluntary
cooperation
of
witnesses
such
as
these.
we
advance
in
this
case
what
are
in
effect
five
independent
grounds
for
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
resolution
of
anyone
of
these
in
our
favor
and
we
believe
we
are
clearly
correct
on
all
five
necessitates
a
reversal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
these
grounds
briefly
summarize
as
follows.
first
we
say,
the
constitution
is
not
violated
by
eliciting
voluntary
grand
jury
testimony
of
any
person,
ordinary
witness
or
putative
defendant
without
warnings
of
any
kind.
second,
we
say
if
some
kind
of
warning
is
required,
respondent
received
an
adequate
warning
in
this
case.
third
we
say,
respondent
was
not
in
fact
a
putative
defendant
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
applied
an
erroneous
standard
which
would
be
very
damaging,
if
the
putative
defendant
notion
were
allowed
to
enter
the
law
of
this
area.
fourth,
we
say,
even
if
the
questioning
was
improper,
respondent
could
not
answer
with
perjuriously
and
it
therefore
has
not
remedy
on
a
perjury
prosecution.
and
fifth,
a
related
contention,
this
is
in
any
event
not
inappropriate
occasion
for
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule.
there
is
no
demonstrated
basis
for
believing
that
if
the
court
announces
a
standard
for
prosecutors
in
this
area,
those
standards
would
not
be
followed
in
virtually
every
case.
because
these
points
cover
a
great
deal
of
ground
and
because
very
little
time
is
available
for
me
to
cover
them
all,
i
invite
the
court
to
feel
free
to
interrupt
at
anytime
with
questions
about
any
aspect
of
the
case
that
may
be
of
particular
interest
or
concern.
if
there
are
not
any
questions
at
this
point,
i
will
begin
with
the
–-
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
other
two
points
relate
to
the
perjury
aspect
of
the
case
in
our
contention
that
even
if
the
testimony
might
be
suppressible
for
use
in
a
substantive
prosecution
that
is
perjurious
nature
means
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
any
remedy
under
the
knox
case
and
bryson
and
so
on.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
number
five,
is
that
because
any
rule
that
the
court
announces
would
likely
be
followed
by
prosecutors
because
we
do
not
have
the
danger
of
persistent
prevalent
abuses
in
this
area.
there
is
no
occasion
to
apply
an
exclusionary
rule
in
this
instance
where
what
was
done
if
wrong
had
never
yet
been
declared
wrong
by
any
appellate
court
prior
to
the
interrogation
of
respondent
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
would
disrupt
it
and
my
argument
here
is
that
this
is
supreme
court
and
your
duty
is
to
apply
the
constitution
and
that
is
not
clear
to
me
as
to
the
extent
of
your
power
to
require
such
a
warning
under
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
congress
could
certainly
do
it
and
i
do
not
think
if
it
wore
done
that
it
would
seriously
disrupt
grand
jury
functioning.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
either
that
or
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
for
fear
that
if
they
failed
to
do
it,
there
might
be
some
adverse
consequences
such
as
here
occurred.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
aware
of.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
consistent
practice
and
it
is
varies
from
district
to
district
depending
on
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
involve,
some
give
target
warnings,
some
with
tele-target
that
he
is
a
target
of
the
grand
jury.
of
course
that
kind
of
thing
would
not
do
any
good
in
the
case
like
this
because
we
were
not
aware
that
until
the
court
of
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
told
us
that
mr.
mandujano
was
a
target
or
a
putative
--.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
a
point
that
i
would
come
to.
we
think
a
miranda
warning
would
be
incorrect?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
is
normally
the
case.
but
in
the
gregory-washington
case
in
which
there
is
a
pending
petition
before
the
court.
apparently
full
miranda
warnings
were
given.
the
court
still
found
unsatisfactory
because
he
was
not
told

mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
the
miranda
does
not
say
has
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
at
his
side.
the
miranda
warning
does
not
say
he
has
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
at
his
side
during
the
interrogation.
it
simply
says
you
have
a
right
to
consult
with
the
lawyer
before
answering
questions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
practice
is
not
to
have
attorneys
in
the
grand
jury.
i
might
think
that
is
a
fairly
uniform
practice.
the
practice
is
when
someone
has
an
attorney
to
allow
him
outside
and
to
allow
them
to
do
consult
him.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
far
as
i
know
although
there
has
been
some
law
review
articles
that
have
suggested
people
should
have
their
attorneys
in
with
them
in
the
grand
jury.
there
are
problems
of
grand
jury
secrecy
and
there
are
problems
under
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
about
allowing
them.
now,
i
think
the
main
constitutional
point
in
this
case
is
that
the
proposition
that
any
grand
jury
witness
whether
or
not
he
is
a
putative
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
any
advisive
rights
under
the
constitution
and
he
is
certainly
not
entitled
to
full
miranda
warnings
which
would
we
say
entail
a
significant
misstatement
of
his
rights.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
hazy
as
to
whether
its
contrary
conclusion
is
rooted
under
the
self-incrimination
provision
or
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
or
because
of
the
substantial
congruity
of
its
approach
with
miranda,
it
seems
most
useful
here
to
treat
it
as
resting
principally
on
self-incrimination
as
far
as
the
need
for
warnings
themselves
is
concerned.
in
determining
whether
what
transpired
in
this
case,
in
fringe
respondent’s
self–incrimination
rights,
it
seems
to
me
useful
to
begin
with
something
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked,
the
language
of
the
constitutional
provision
itself.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
themselves.
we
were
accused
by
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
of
ignoring
johnson
against
zerbst
standard
of
knowing
in
deliberate
waiver
and
addressing
ourselves
to
compulsion
only.
it
is
they
however
not
we
who
have
put
the
court
before
the
constitutional
horse.
for
if
there
is
no
compulsion.
there
can
be
no
violation
of
the
privilege.
this
court
has
spoken
on
several
occasions
a
background
jury
testimony
and
compulsion.
for
instance
in
the
monia
case
in
317
u.s.,
it
said
a
grand
jury
witness
must
claim
the
privilege
or
he
will
not
be
considered
to
what
has
been
compelled
within
the
meaning
of
the
amendment.
and
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases
to
that
effect.
we
submit
that
this
proposition
does
not
alter
simply
because
the
witness
is
a
putative
defendant.
indeed
in
the
dionisio
case,
this
court
recognized
that
the
obligations
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
which
is
the
one
element
of
compulsion
to
which
respondent
was
subject
is
no
different
for
a
purpose
who
may
be
himself
be
the
subject
of
the
grand
jury’s
inquiry
than
for
any
other
witness.
the
court
of
appeals
analogy
to
miranda
is
an
error.
you
cannot
equate
incommunicado
custodial
police
interrogation
with
grand
jury
question.
i
hardly
need
to
rehearse
the
litany
of
concerns
expressed
in
miranda
that
are
simply
inapplicable
to
grand
jury
questioning
before
23
fellow
citizens
who
whatever
else
they
may
be
are
surely
not
so
compliant
to
the
prosecutors
wishes
that
they
would
countenance
the
kinds
of
interrogative
practices
cataloged
in
miranda
as
means
of
overcoming
the
arrested
individual’s
will
and
extracting
a
statement
from
them.
moreover,
because
you
have
these
citizen
witnesses
to
what
transpired
and
because
in
many
cases
including
this
you
have
a
transcript
of
proceedings,
you
do
not
have
the
problem
of
reconstructing
what
happened,
the
problem
of
being
unable
to
establish
the
kinds
of
improper
techniques
that
may
have
been
used.
moreover,
the
putative
defendant
notion
is
not
useful
in
making
the
critical
constitutional
inquiry
into
compulsion.
the
presence
or
absence
of
impermissible
compulsion
is
a
determination
that
turns
on
the
state
of
mind
of
the
individual
upon
the
question
whether
in
the
circumstances;
it
is
likely
that
his
will
was
overborne.
the
grand
jury
questioning
is
to
be
equated
with
incommunicado
police
interrogation
as
inherently
coercive.
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
it
is
more
coercive
of
putative
defendants
than
of
other
witnesses.
indeed
the
putative
defendant
concept
really
has
no
application
in
miranda
either
certainly
if
you
were
arrested
and
taken
down
to
the
back
room
of
the
station
house
even
if
the
police
had
no
reason
whatsoever
for
doing
it
or
simple
harassment
and
were
not
planning
to
charge
us.
we
would
be
entitled
to
miranda
warnings.
now,
let
suppose
for
a
minute
that
some
kind
of
warning
is
deemed
appropriate.
should
it
be
full
miranda
warnings?
we
think
certainly
not.
our
most
substantial
objection
to
the
miranda
warnings
in
the
area
where
we
feel
it
most
significantly
misstates
what
the
witnesses
rights
are
is
the
absolute
right
to
silence
which
is
suggested
in
miranda.
now,
analytically
it
is
not
clear
whether
right
to
silence
comes
from.
it
is
clear
however
that
the
police
have
no
power
to
compel
anyone
to
speak.
they
are
not
the
people
in
our
legal
system
who
are
vested
with
that
power
and
therefore
in
a
correlative
sense,
the
arrested
person
has
an
absolute
right
to
speak
since
there
is
no
lawful
or
an
absolute
right
to
remain
silent.
excuse
me,
since
there
is
no
lawful
power
to
compel
them
to
speak.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
is
right.
but
i
think
the
court’s
concern
in
miranda
in
stating
that
there
was
a
right
to
silence
was
a
more
practical
concern
which
was
to
tell
the
arrested
person
in
clear
and
unequivocal
terms
that
he
could
understand
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
that
he
did
not
have
to
answer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now
that
is
not
the
case
with
the
grand
jury
and
branzburg,
calandra,
and
many
cases
of
this
court
clearly
indicate
that
you
do
have
an
obligation
to
answer
questions
before
a
grand
jury.
it
is
the
grand
jury
which
is
the
instrument
in
our
legal
system
for
securing
information
regarding
the
commission
of
crimes.
now,
of
course
you
have
your
privilege.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
you
do
not
have
it.
we
are
not
taking
it
away
from
anyone
in
this
case.
it
has
not
been
taken
away
from
respondent.
therefore
if
anything
is
to
be
required.
it
would
be
in
explanation
and
here
was
given
i
think
in
clear
terms
that
you
need
not
answer
questions
where
the
answers
may
tend
to
incriminate
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
poses
an
interesting
question
and
there
are
some.
i
think
i
would
have
the
same
position,
yes.
i
mean
let
us
take
an
example,
supposed
that
a
person
who
has
been
arrested
for
some
offense
also
happened
to
be
in
a
bank
when
a
robbery
took
place
having
nothing
to
do
with
his
offense.
such
a
person
has
no
right
of
silence
before
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
think
it
would
not
be
as
irrational
to
make
a
distinction
in
that
area
as
it
is
to
make
the
distinction
in
the
court
of
appeals
made
on
the
basis
of
a
putative
defendant.
after
all,
kirby
for
instance
recognizes
that
the
right
to
counsel
as
attached
for
an
actual
defendant.
but
i
think
our
position
would
be
that
he
is
not
compelled
and
he
does
not
have
to
be
given
the
miranda
warnings
because
the
miranda
warnings
were
designed
to
neutralize
a
particular
concern
in
a
particular
environment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
think
there
are
several
explanations.
one,
that
seems
to
me
most
obvious
is
that
the
prosecution
as
an
adversary
to
the
defense
could
have
not
purpose
in
calling
the
defendant
to
the
stand
other
than
to
incriminate
him.
so
that
its
purpose
is
inherently
incriminatory
when
it
calls
them.
but
beyond
that
there
is
the
problem
that
the
jury
sitting
there
is
the
finder
of
fact
in
the
criminal
trial,
the
one
that
would
pass
on
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
such
an
individual
would
have
an
attorney
at
that
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
would
have
had
an
attorney
appointed
for
him.
people
are
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
they
are
not
pulled
out
of
their
houses
in
the
middle
of
the
night
or
brought
unexpectedly
to
the
grand
jury
so
i
would
not
be
very
concerned
in
that
context
either.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
might
assert
it
or
he
might
not
assert
it.
that
of
course
would
depend
on
the
individual
case.
but
actually
my
argument
does
not
depend
on
that.
the
prohibition
is
against
compelling
him
to
speak.
now,
unless
some
other
provision
and
the
self-incrimination
provision
comes
into
play,
perhaps
the
due
process
provision
and
that
gets
into
an
area
where
it
is
harder
to
engage
in
a
kind
of
rigorous
analysis
that
you
can
with
self-incrimination.
i
do
not
see
any
self-incrimination
objection
to
calling
him
before
the
grand
jury
and
asking
him
in
a
polite
and
straight
forward
manner.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
without
giving
him
any
warning.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
far
as
the
self-incrimination
provision
is
concerned
that
he
is
only
right
under
the
constitution
is
not
to
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
if
he
is
not
being
compelled
then
our
position
would
be
as
a
itself
matter,
self-incrimination
analysis,
that
that
questioning
is
permissible.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
there
might
be
and
that
is
very
likely
in
so
far
as
the
questioning
concerns
the
crime
and
others
that
he
would
have
available
his
privilege
but
i
do
not
see
that
our
system
should
be
offended
by
the
idea
that
if
that
man
comes
in
and
is
asked
in
a
perfectly
straight
forward
way
questions
that
would
yield
information
about
his
or
others
involvement
in
criminal
activity.
i
do
not
think
our
system
should
recoil
in
any
way
that
practice
or
using
the
results
of
such
questioning.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
is
compelled
to
appear.
but
not
critical
compulsion
for
purposes
of
this
analysis
would
be
the
compulsion
to
answer
and
he
is
not
compelled
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
now
that
would
pose
a
different
problem.
if
they
said
to
him,
if
you
do
not
answer
this
question
about
where
you
were
on
the
evening
of
june
10,
you
are
going
to
be
held
in
contempt.
then
arguably
his
answer
would
be
compelled
in
those
circumstances.
but
if
they
say
nothing
to
him
except
where
were
you
on
the
evening
of
june
10?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
may
feel
an
inner
compulsion
to
answer.
indeed,
the
average
person
who
if
the
prosecutor
called
them
on
the
telephone,
said
i
would
like
to
know
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
that
is
not
the
constitutional
compulsion.
i
would
like
to
save
if
i
have
a
minute
or
two
for
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
