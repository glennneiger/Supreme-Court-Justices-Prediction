unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
frey
you
mentioned
that
he
had
been
advised
of
his
privilege
on
more
than
one
occasion?
unknown
speaker
i
wish
then
to
ask,
i
gather
in
court
of
appeals
though
at
page
1190
the
warnings
that
were
given
were
not
adequate
in
advisory
although
even
though
the
appellees
fifth
amendment
rights
against
self-incrimination?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
see
but
do
we
have
an
issue
whether
they
were
or
were
not
adequate?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
is
there
any
question
that
he
did
not
understand
what
was
asked
and
what
he
answered?
unknown
speaker
did
cavalier
had
his
name
appear
before
this
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
say
the
purpose
was
of
asking
him
questions,
the
answers
to
which
prosecutor
already
knew?
unknown
speaker
on
what
grounds?
unknown
speaker
three,
i
was
not
attending
to
you.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
is
number
four.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
as
long
as
you
are
inviting
questions
let
me
ask
you
one.
in
your
brief
on
page
19,
you
say
it
is
common
practice
for
government
attorneys
to
consider
such
warnings
to
grand
jury
witnesses
who
are
suspected
of
involvement
in
the
criminal
activity.
if
this
court
would
require
then,
a
simple
warning,
i
take
it
would
not
disrupt
governmental
practice
today?
unknown
speaker
but
the
government
does
it
not
because
it
feels
compelled
by
any
judicial
decision
or
constitutional
rule
but
just
as
a
matter
of
committee
or
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
rule
as
to
when
such
a
warning
is
omitted?
unknown
speaker
the
warning
of
which
you
speak
is
not
a
miranda
warning?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
a
factual
one.
the
warning
of
which
you
speak
that
is
often
given
or
sometimes
given
as
a
warning
that
he
may
refuse
to
answer
questions
if
he
thinks
they
may
incriminate?
unknown
speaker
including
the
right
to
have
a
lawyer
present
at
his
side
during
the
interrogation
because
that
is
contrary?
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
(inaudible)
terms
which
you
know
kind
of
out
of
date,
there
would
be
a
privilege
of
silence
rather
than
a
right,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
a
privilege
of
silence
which
would
correlatively
be
no
right
on
the
part
of
the
interrogating
police
officer
–-
unknown
speaker
he
can
understand
questions.
unknown
speaker
he
need
not
answer
the
questions.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
the
same
position
if
with
respect
to
a
person
who
had
been
arrested
and
was
in
jail
or
out
on
bail
and
he
was
called
before
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
in
that
case
--
unknown
speaker
say
you
just
wanted
to
say
you
arrested
him
for
bank
robbery
and
you
had
to
get
him
indicted
but
you
did
not
want
to
indict
the
wrong
fellow
either
so
you
called
them
before
the
grand
jury
just
to
ask
him
whether
he
might
talk
to
you.
you
want
to
be
fair
to
him
and
you
found
--
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
explanation
for
the
rule
and
at
the
trial
that
you
may
not
call
the
defendant
to
the
stand
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
frey
suppose,
you
have
someone
actually
the
subject
of
a
former
criminal
compliant.
a
formal
criminal
complaint
and
he
has
brought
before
the
grand
jury
and
questions
are
put
to
him
about
the
specific
charges
made
in
that
not
complaint
without
giving
him
any
advance
warning
of
self-incrimination
or
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
at
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
because
you
mean
as
a
practical
matter
having
an
attorney,
he
would
have
been
advised
if
he
has
a
privilege
and
no
one
else
would
advise
and
he
would
assert
it?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
without
giving
him
any
warning?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
about
the
very
charge.
he
is
questioned
about
the
very
charge
which
is
already
--
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
there
is
no
compulsion
if
he
is
someone
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
made
a
statement
that
he
had
an
obvious
language
problem.
can
you
explain
that
one
to
me?
how
does
the
appendix
show
that?
he
had
been
in
trouble
with
the
law,
a
number
of
times.
he
had
a
tenth
grade
education
as
in
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
certainly
speaks
very
well.
he
does
not
speak
faultingly.
he
does
not
misuse
words,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
peters
--
unknown
speaker
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
respondent
had
been
a
ph.d.?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
case
that
he
was
indicted
on
two
counts,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
now
he
has
been
convicted
on
that,
has
he
not?
unknown
speaker
without
the
benefit
of
–
without
this
evidence.
unknown
speaker
no
doubt
about
that
but
--
at
least
to
the
extending
perjury
of
itself.
that
is
all
immaterial.
unknown
speaker
including
the
right
to
counsel?
unknown
speaker
where
would
he
be
in
the
grand
jury
room?
unknown
speaker
who
on
that
approach
appoints
as
in
indigent,
if
the
witness
is
an
indigent
and
has
no
counsel?
he
cannot
afford
to
hire
one.
who
appoints
counsel
for
him?
unknown
speaker
you
mention
about
the
federal
grand
jury,
under
texas
state
procedure,
is
the
counsel
allowed
in
the
grand
jury
room?
unknown
speaker
and
with
the
impunity.
