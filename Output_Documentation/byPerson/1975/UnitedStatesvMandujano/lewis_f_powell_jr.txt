so,
your
argument
about
the
tenth
grade
education
and
the
possible
limitations
of
respondentâ€™s
capacity
to
understand
english
are
peripheral
to
your
central
position
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
your
position
require
us
to
examine
the
facts
in
each
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
atmosphere
was
coercive?
