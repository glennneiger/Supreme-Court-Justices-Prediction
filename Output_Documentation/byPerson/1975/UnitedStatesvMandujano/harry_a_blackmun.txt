justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
read
the
testimony,
he
sounds
perfectly
capable
of
speaking
english
and
he
did
have
a
tenth
grade
education.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
take
it
he
â€“-
well,
am
i
correct
in
my
impression
that
he
had
no
struggle
with
the
english
language
despite
his
spanish
surname?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
means
through
the
second
year
or
end
of
high
school,
he
should
be
able
to
read
and
write.
go
ahead,
you
tell
me.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
peters
let
me
interrupt
you.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
as
a
matter
of
terminology,
you
make
constant
references
to
the
miranda
warnings
and
that
miranda
should
apply.
do
i
understand
you
think
the
four
aspects
of
the
miranda
rule
should
apply
here
or
just
something
comparable
to
it?
laundered
so
to
speak
at
this
situation?
