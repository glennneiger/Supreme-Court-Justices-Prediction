mr.
michael
allen
peters
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
supreme
court.
i
would
just
like
to
first
of
all
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
question
raised
by
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
and
that
is
the
compulsion
whether
or
not
in
this
case,
roy
mandujano
can
be
a
witness
against
himself.
in
this
case,
i
feel
that
he
was.
the
question
that
under
rides
the
whole
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
a
grand
jury
is
inherently
coercive.
and
if
we
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
will
find
that
roy
mandujano
was
subpoenaed
compelled
against
his
will
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
to
ask
to
answer
specific
questions
about
that
which
the
government
already
had
enough
information
on
which
the
basis
to
base
an
indictment.
number
two,
when
mr.
mandujano
appeared
before
the
grand
jury,
the
special
prosecutor
informed
mr.
mandujano
that
this
was
a
special
grand
jury
and
the
attention
that
the
grand
jury
was
covering
was
limited
to
narcotics
traffic,
irs
evasions,
and
violations
of
the
gun
law.
and
if
the
court
will
note
the
appendix,
before
they
even
approach
the
subject
matter
of
the
gun
or
irs
violations,
they
have
pretty
well
ran
mr.
mandujano
through
the
gamut
of
questionings
through
some
15
pages
prior
to
even
going
into
the
information
upon
which
they
already
had
enough
evidence
to
indict
mr.
mandujano.
mr.
mandujano
indeed
when
he
appeared
clearly,
the
escobedo
rule
which
is
incorporated
in
the
miranda,
the
whole
focus
of
the
investigation
was
upon
mr.
mandujano
and
the
warnings
that
are
recorded
in
the
appendix
clearly
are
insufficient
in
any
way
shape
or
form
as
miranda
applies
and
i
would
even
urge
that
in
addition
to
the
regular
miranda
warnings
that
mr.
mandujano
should
have
been
informed
that
he
was
indeed
himself
the
focus
of
a
specific
investigation
and
on
which
they
already
have
sufficient
evidence
to
indict
him.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
the
fifth
amendment
against
the
compulsion,
against
testifying
against
oneself
incorporates
that
aspect
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
i
would
say
that
monia
applies
to
the
normal
grand
jury
witness
whereas
here
we
have
a
special
creature,
the
period
of
defendant
concept.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
here
a
normal
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
when
he
subpoenaed
to
appear,
and
i
would
say
that
even
a
defendant
who
is
subpoenaed
to
appear
is
not
entitled
to
any
kind
of
pre-warnings
until
the
special
prosecutor
or
the
grand
jury
specifically
go
into
the
actual
evidence
which
they
have
on
that
individual.
and
at
that
time,
in
this
case,
mr.
mandujano
was
removed
from
the
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
role
and
placed
in
a
special
category
and
monia
directs
itself
to
the
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
and
in
this
case,
mr.
mandujano
as
the
appendix
point
out
and
i
attempted
to
clarify
in
my
brief.
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
his
rights
were.
he
did
not
understand
that
he
had
an
obvious
language
problem.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
i
really
do
not
recall
the
facts
of
monia
that
clearly
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes
your
honor.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
based
on
mr.
mandujano’s
--
the
school
systems
these
days,
justice
blackmun
are
lack
a
lot
to
be
desired.
however,
i
think
it
is
clear
from
somebody
excerpts
which
i
have
quoted
on
page
18
of
respondent’s
brief,
in
addition
to
which
the
warnings
in
his
apparent
lack
of
understanding
indicate
that
he
obviously
had
a
problem
with
understanding
the
spoken
and
i
would
assume
the
written
english
language
from
page
18
through
page
20
of
my
brief.
i
point
out
that
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
it
is
not
the
misuse
of
the
word.
i
think
it
is
the
apparent
lack
of
understanding
as
i
have
attempted
to
point
out
to
this
court.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well
let
us
say
that
the
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
indeed,
we
are
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
would
point
out
that
here
he
may
have
a
partial
understanding
of
some
of
the
questions
and
some
of
the
words
association
but
indeed,
when
he
is
asked
a
simple
thing
like
what
is
the
address
that
he
is
living.
he
said
2217
and
the
special
prosecutor
retorted
2270
and
my
client
answered
yes.
and
the
whole
testimony
even
though
there
are
some
that
obviously
that
he
had
to
understand
some
use
of
the
english
language
but
i
would
say
his
total
awareness
and
understanding
meets
a
tenth
grade
educated
latin
american
and
sure
his
association
i
would
say
with
the
use
of
the
english
language
is
probably
very
limited
and
that
his
understanding
of
some
words
indeed
are
apparent
from
the
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
i
have
been
there
on
a
couple
occasions
justice.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
i
would
just
make
a
presumption
that
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
that
my
limited
experience
of
understanding
the
school
system,
my
wife
being
a
school
teacher
herself.
sometimes
they
are
put
in
a
position
where
they
pass
an
individual
just
to
get
them
out
of
their
personal
classroom
and
just
advancing
him
even
if
he
does
not
grasp
or
have
an
understanding
of
such
as
english
language.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
possibly
not.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
no,
justice
marshall.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes,
justice
marshall.
now,
when
mr.
mandujano
was
compelled
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury,
based
upon
all
the
previous,
the
special
prosecutor
put
mandujano
in
a
murphy
v.
waterfront
trilemma
of
either
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
right
which
he
clearly
was
not
informed
of
and
listed
from
the
appendix,
it
is
clear
that
he
did
not
understand
any
of
the
warnings.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes,
justice.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
i
would
say,
yes
my
position
would
be
the
same
in
that
here
they
as
in
the
instance
of
the
ph.d.
if
they
asked
the
ph.d.
specific
questions
about
a
specific
involvement
in
a
crime
whether
or
not
a
miranda
addresses
itself
is.
whether
or
not
you
have
the
ph.d.
or
tenth
grade
education
before
proceeding
on
with
the
questioning,
they
must
administer
warnings,
miranda
warnings
and
must
understand
and
knowingly
and
understandably
waive
those
warnings
if
he
so
desires.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
i
would
say
mr.
justice
powell
that
that
is
true
but
the
overall
argument
and
the
final
result
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
decision
show
and
intend
to
show
that
his
whole
atmosphere
before
the
grand
jury
on
mr.
mandujano
was
overwhelming
and
his
tenth
grade
education
was
just
one
aspect
of
his
whole
presence
and
understanding.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
mr.
justice
powell,
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be
on
a
basis
of
a
case
to
case
examination
of
the
individual
facts.
i
would
submit
that
can
make
it
a
requirement
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
a
prosecutor
who
intends
to
ask
specific
questions
about
specific
crime
in
which
they
could
have
easily
have
been
diagnosed
for
mandujano
as
well
as
they
did
making
him
appear
under
compulsion
of
the
subpoena
and
answer
those
questions,
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances
in
which
they
are
going
to
ask
any
witness
questions
of
the
crime
itself
that
at
that
point
in
time
he
no
longer
is
an
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
and
must
be
afforded
the
fifth
amendment
right.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
mr.
justice
white
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes
was
one
for
the
count
of
attempt
to
distribution
of
one
ounce
of
heroin.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes,
he
has
your
honor.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
mr.
justice
white
i
would
say
no.
that
each
one
of
these
elements,
the
coerciveness
of
appearing
before
the
grand
jury,
the
fact
that
mr.
mandujano
was
not
an
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
i
apparently,
i
did
not
understand
you
question
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
yes
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
that
is
correct.
but
the
end
result
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
holding
mr.
justice
white
is
based
upon
the
prior
concepts
of
having
this
individual
who
is
in
the
class
of
a
quasi-defendant
and
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
as
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out,
the
totality
of
all
the
circumstances
showed
that
mr.
mandujano
was
definitely,
he
was
just
so
totally
unfair,
the
whole
procedure
that
mr.
mandujano
was
involved
in
that
the
fifth
circuit
as
well
as
the
district
court
felt
that
the
fifth
amendment
should
apply
and
there
should
be
this
one
exception
to
that
rule
and
if
this
court
and
i
feel
that
this
court
should
consider
affirming
the
lower
court's
decision
that
the
incidence
in
putting
individuals
in
a
position
of
mr.
mandujano
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
restraint
upon
the
government
and
their
use
and
in
this
case
i
feel
was
a
blatant
misuse
of
a
proceeding,
just
another
device
in
which
they
can
put
an
individual
in
an
unfair
and
certainly
a
very
uncertain
position.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
that
would
apply
in
all
other
cases
except
before
the
case
before
the
bar
and
as
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
there
must
be
some
exception
consider
the
analogy
of
miranda
if
there
is
a
fair
to
give
miranda
warnings
at
the
time
for
risk,
statements
would
be
suppressed
and
we
are
asking
for
the
same
remedy
to
compensate
and
counter
this
totally
unfair
proceeding
in
which
my
client
was
participated
in.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
well,
he
was
put
in
a
position
where
in
the
government
rarely
concedes
that
in
a
companion
case
arising
out
of
the
western
district
of
texas
in
rangel(ph),
they
felt
that
indeed
warnings
were
to
be
given
and
they
did
not
petition
this
court
to
consider
that
question
because
they
felt
that
mr.
rangel
because
of
the
implications
of
the
so
called
warning
given
that
he
was
compelled
and
given
the
murphy
waterfront
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
they
did
proceed
in
neither
the
substantive
nor
the
perjury
count
in
mr.
rangel’s
case.
i
would
say
further
that
addressing
the
court’s
attention
to
committing
a
perjury
with
impunity
concept
that
a
grand
jury
as
in
this
case
cannot
use
the
fruits
of
only
illegalities
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
says
the
bringing
and
asking
of
these
questions
upon
which
they
already
knew
the
answers
to
just
asked
for
too
much
on
the
part
of
credible
people
to
believe
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
grand
jury
testimony
indicates
that
throughout
the
first
fifteen
questions,
they
had
sufficient
evidence
and
they
had
sufficient
background
knowledge
to
gauge
the
truthfulness
of
mr.
mandujano’s
answers.
but
they
knew
what
they
were
bringing
therefore,
they
had
sufficient
evidence
to
indict
them
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
that
it
does
not
occur
until
page
15
where
they
even
begin
to
and
this
is
after
they
have
exhausted
all
the
normal
questions
that
a
prosecutor
normally
questions
any
grand
jury
when
it
is
to
establish
whether
or
not
he
is
telling
the
truth
and
the
special
prosecutor
himself
indicated
in
the
grand
jury
or
in
the
appendix
that
the
reason
he
asks
these
questions
was
to
gauge
the
truthfulness
and
that
in
itself
shows
you
that
they
had
some
sort
of
it
is
not
entrapment
per
se
but
is
certainly
smacks
of
it
as
the
fifth
circuit
indicated
in
the
district
court.
i
would
say
further
that
since
the
focus
of
the
investigation
was
on
mr.
mandujano
and
as
miranda
should
apply
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
mr.
mandujano
certainly
did
not
knowingly
and
understandingly
waive
any
of
his
rights
and
–
-
mr.
michael
allen
peters
oh
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
think
that
indeed
the
miranda
warnings
as
they
have
been
established
by
this
court
should
apply
but
i
think
also
that
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
including
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
i
would
say
that
if
he
were
not
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
i
know
this
is
not
the
practice
in
the
federal
courts
but
if
you
were
not
in
the
grand
jury
room,
the
grand
jury
itself
might
think
that
every
departure
confer
with
this
counsel
with
obviously
indicate
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
it
would
be
the
presiding
judge
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
no
your
honor
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
reading
the
post
this
morning
that
illinois
has
adapted
a
state
proceeding
wherein
they
have
incorporated
the
basis
of
the
respondent’s
position
in
this
case
including
having
the
presence
of
counsel
seated
in
the
grand
jury
room
with
his
client
during
the
entire
proceeding
and
they
have
incorporated
this
under
illinois
law.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
would
say
that
mr.
mandujano
as
a
putative
defendant
who
is
not
given
his
miranda
warnings
which
he
is
entitled
to
that
in
this
limited
case,
due
to
the
fundamental
unfairness
of
the
entire
proceedings
can
commit
perjury
with
impunity
and
this
court
is
not
sanctioning
perjury
and
i
am
not
asking
it
to
sanction
perjury.
but
i
am
asking
this
court
to
affirm
the
court’s
opinions
below
based
upon
the
limited
instance
where
the
proceeding
is
so
totally
unfair
and
the
focus
of
the
whole
investigation
is
upon
that
individual
that
they
have
more
than
qualified
whether
or
not
he
was
indeed
telling
the
truth
or
not
but
yet
go
beyond
that
and
ask
him
specific
questions
about
the
crime
itself
in
which
they
knew
they
had
complete
evidence
sufficient
enough
to
indict
him.
i
would
just
point
out
to
the
court
that
if
they
had
not
gone
beyond
the
specific
aspect
of
going
into
the
crime
itself
then
mr.
mandujano
if
committed
perjury
as
to
the
general
information
then
i
would
say
that
he
would
then
be
in
the
status
of
the
ordinary
grand
jury
witness
who
is
not
entitled
to
a
specific
miranda
warnings
--
mr.
michael
allen
peters
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
my
position.
mr.
michael
allen
peters
and
with
impunity
in
this
limited
instance,
it
is
a
counter
measure
of
fundamentally
unfair
proceeding
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
adapt
the
betts
versus
brady
decision
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
relies
on
and
that
is
totally
fundamentally
unfair
that
the
individual
in
this
limited
instance,
the
statements
must
be
suppressed
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
suppress
and
affirm
the
court
decisions
below.
thank
you.
