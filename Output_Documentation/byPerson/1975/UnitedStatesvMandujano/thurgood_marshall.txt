justice
thurgood
marshall
tell
me,
if
he
does
not
answer
he
is
going
to
be
held
in
contempt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
for
the
average
citizen
that
is
called
into
a
grand
jury,
he
may
feel
a
compulsion
to
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
not
the
compulsion
you
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
been
in
san
antonio?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
a
very
good
school
system.
it
is
one
of
the
best
in
texas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
presumption
is
that
if
a
person
with
a
tenth
grade
education
understands
english.
now,
how
you
went
up
to
that
presumption?
by
taking
a
word
here
and
a
word
there?
how
are
you
going
to
get
over
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
are
you
a
better
judge
of
a
personâ€™s
reading
ability
than
the
school
officials?
justice
thurgood
marshall
possibly?
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
say
he
has
got
(inaudibe)
by
saying
that
in
your
opinion
he
has
not
got
a
tenth
grade
education?
