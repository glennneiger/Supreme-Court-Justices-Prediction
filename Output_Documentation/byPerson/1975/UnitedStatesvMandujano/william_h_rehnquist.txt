justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
think
requires
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
will
you
do
with
our
monia
case
where
we
say
that
if
you
want
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment,
you
have
to
do
it
before
the
grand
jury
that
if
you
voluntarily
answer,
it
is
not
compelled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
indication
in
monia
that
the
witness
there
was
warned
or
that
he
had
a
particularly
clear
understanding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
even
if
you
are
right
about
the
warnings
that
it
is
unfair
the
government
to
call
someone
whom
as
you
described
in
the
fifth
circuit
describes
a
putative
defendant,
that
does
not
give
the
man
called
a
license
to
perjure
himself,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
suppose
you
suppress
statements
where
he
might
have
claimed
the
fifth
amendment
but
did
not,
because
you
say
he
did
not
get
a
warning.
that
still
does
not
go
to
the
questions
of
whether
it
was
not
a
question
if
he
is
a
refusing
a
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment,
it
is
the
question
is
if
he
is
lying.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
he
convicted
of
perjury
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
they
asked
him
about
the
crime
itself,
he
may
not
only
claim
the
fifth
amendment
but
he
may
perjure
himself
according
to
your
submission?
