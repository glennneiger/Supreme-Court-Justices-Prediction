justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
a
prior
restraint,
if
you
order
the
prosecutor
not
to
discuss
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
that
the
same
constitutional
principles
apply
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
is
a
prior
restraint
is
not
controlling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
important
is
the
label
prior
restraint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
prettyman
what
if
your
ministers
had
also
agreed
that
they
would
advocate
lynching
the
man,
could
a
prior
restraint
be
permitted
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
abrams,
let
me
just
ask
you
a
specific
question.
what
do
you
do
about
the
problem
of
the
inadmissible
confession?
say,
for
some
reason
a
confession
is
very
dramatic,
but
yet
it
would
be
rather
clear
that
it
would
not
be
admissible
to
trial.
is
that
just
something
we
have
to
live
with?there
is
no
way
of
curtailing
the
publication
of
that
kind
of
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
quick
question,
your
characterization
of
the
order
is
a
narrow
one.
it
does
include
as
i
understand,
the
way
it
has
been
narrow
down
the
prohibition
against
publishing
any
information
strongly
implicative
of
the
accused
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
slain,
do
you
regard
that
as
a
narrow
prohibition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
certainly,
i
do
not
want
take
your
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
do
not
we
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
a
routine
case
or
an
exceptional
case,
which
is
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
should
not
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
expedite
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
is
the
relevance
of
these
27
or
30
other
cases
on
the
docket?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
it
is
fairly
exceptional,
but
not
extremely
exceptional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
suggest
maybe
they
just
had
to
replace
one
case
on
the
docket
and
heard
this
one
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
once
more.
are
you
not
demonstrating
that
one
of
the
vices
in
these
orders
is
that
inevitably
they
will
remain
in
effect
for
some
period
of
time
until
the
judicial
process
can
face
up
to
the
question
on
whether
to
remove
them,
but
that
is
an
inevitable
part
of
the
procedure,
if
you
once
enter
the
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mosher,
your
theory
of
why
this
is
a
narrow
order
then
goes
to
the
fact
that
it
was
limited
period
of
time
rather
than
the
scope
of
the
prohibition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
that
third
clause
that
i
asked
you
about
before,
are
they
broad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
information
tending
to
prove
guilt?
is
that
not
that
part
of
the
order
and
is
not
that
the
thing
the
newspaper
people
would
probably
most
like
to
publish
if
they
had
their
own
reporters
out
digging
around
for
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
order
would
have
been
appropriate
in
the
watergate,
the
background?
would
it
have
been
a
narrow
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
tending
to
prove
guilt
of
any
other
crimes
under
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
really,
i
am
just
directing
my
attention
--
directing
your
attention
to
the
scope
of
the
order,
the
prohibition
of
information
tending
to
prove
guilt.
do
you
think
that
is
a
narrow
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
and
it
is
also
limited
to
the
accused
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
to.
information
strongly
implicative
of
the
accused
that
the
perpetrator
of
the
slain
so
(a)
it
has
to
be
strong,
and
(b)
it
has
to
relate
to
the
particular
accused
and
that
is
what
narrow
is
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
a
confession
is
introduced
in
a
preliminary
hearing,
is
there
any
test
of
its
voluntariness?
