mr.
harold
mosher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
harold
mosher,
assistant
attorney
general,
state
of
nebraska.
i
am
representing
the
honorable
hugh
stuart,
judge
of
the
lincoln
county.
mr.
milton
larson,
a
lincoln
county
attorney
is
also
with
me
here
today
and
we
will
argue
a
certain
aspects
of
the
case.
let
me,
if
i
may,
take
this
case
from
the
top.
8:00
p.m.,
october
18th
1975,
knop,
the
only
television
station
in
north
platte
began
transmitting
the
nbc
saturday
night
movie,
the
deadly
tower,
a
dramatization
of
the
1966
massacre
of
16
persons
and
the
wounding
of
31
others
by
a
sniper
atop
the
tower,
the
university
of
texas
in
austin.
by
an
uncanny
coincidence,
the
movie
provided
the
electric
background
for
another
broadcast
mass
murder.
about
18
minutes
into
the
movie,
a
knop
newsman
answered
a
telephone
call
from
the
sheriffs’
office
which
requested
the
television
station
to
put
a
warning
on
the
area
that
there
had
been
killing
at
nearby
sutherland,
nebraska
and
that
everyone
should
lock
their
doors
and
windows.
the
case
at
bar
was
born.
it
is,
therefore,
proper
that
certain
events
be
reviewed
and
placed
in
the
proper
perspective.
the
town
of
sutherland
is
located
in
western
nebraska
between
the
north
and
south
platte
rivers.
it
is
a
cattle
country,
cattle
country
at
its
very
best.
the
town
of
sutherland
had
a
1970
population
of
approximately
800
persons.
the
population
today
is
somewhat
larger
due
to
a
number
of
transient
workers
who
are
employed
in
the
construction
of
a
huge
electrical
generating
facility
nearby.
following
the
television
announcement,
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
sutherland
area
continued
their
investigation
of
the
crime
and
early
the
next
morning,
on
a
tip
by
a
reliable
informer,
they
arrested
the
respondent
erwin
charles
simants
near
the
scene
of
the
crime.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
doubt
it
very
much
your
honor,
i
doubt
it
very
much.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
doubt
it.
i
really
do.
that
of
course
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
but
i
really
doubt
it
very
much.
when
it
is
all
said
and
done
and
i
will
get
to
it
with
your
permission
in
a
few
moments,
the
so
called
restraining
order
here
by
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
is
truly
a
very
narrow
one
and
the
court
simply
was
not
called
upon
to
go
any
further
and
it
certainly
did
not,
but
just
because
of
a
particular
aspect
like
this,
i
doubt
it.
i
doubt
it
because
there
is
so
many
other
variables
in
the
world
in
which
we
live.
movies
nearby
maybe
showing
certain
types
of
film
which
in
and
off
themselves,
one
might
argue
would
lead
to
this
kind
of
thing,
but
i
seriously
doubt
that
one
could
perhaps,
in
a
given
case
when
one
make
a
showing.
i
am
at
loss,
however,
it
suggest
what
that
showing
might
be.
mr.
harold
mosher
certainly.
may
i
get
to
it
in
a
moment?
mr.
harold
mosher
certainly,
let
me
continue
though
with
some
facts
if
i
may
because
i
think
they
are
important.
following
his
arrest,
in
fact
the
same
day,
october
the
19th,
erwin
charles
simants
was
charged
with
six
counts
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
by
a
complaint
filed
by
the
county
attorney
and
thereafter
that
same
day,
simants
was
arraigned
and
the
preliminary
hearing
was
scheduled
for
october
27,
1975.
the
statement
on
page
five
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioners
is
that
“on
october
20,
a
lincoln
county
attorney
told
the
press
that
simants
have
given
authorities
a
statement,”
exemplifies
the
need,
in
case
such
as
this,
for
the
trial
courts
to
be
able
to
restrict
the
media
in
certain
cases.
specifically
the
quote
on
page
five
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
refers
to
read
at
page
88
of
the
joint
appendix
and
there
sure
enough,
there
is
a
copy
of
a
newspaper
and
a
quote
“lincoln
county
attorney
milton
larson,
said
monday,
that
simants
has
given
authorities
his
statement.”
putting
aside
for
a
moment
how
the
reputation
of
a
quotation
such
as
that
could
influence
a
community
where
a
jury
will
ultimately
be
chosen,
is
the
naked
fact
that
the
statement
is
false.
indeed
the
writer
who
is
the
bureau
chief
of
one
of
one
the
nation's
largest
wire
services
has
now
admitted
that
hearsay
of
an
eminent's
driver's
husband
was
falsely
attributed
to
the
county
attorney.
that
is
the
petitioners
themselves
have
demonstrated
in
this
court,
at
this
time,
the
need
for
restrictive
orders
in
cases
such
as
this.
it
is,
therefore,
not
--
mr.
harold
mosher
i
think
it
means
your
honor
is
that,
first
of
all,
before
they
are
going
to
get
to
a
question
like
this,
before
they
would
ever
to
it
again,
is
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
allow
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
to
implement
section
3.1
of
the
guidelines
of
the
american
bar
association's
fair
trial
free
press.
if
you
allow
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
to
implement
that
particular
section,
the
section
provides
that
defense
counsel
may
move,
timely
move
at
anytime
prior
to
trial,
to
close
the
hearing,
to
close
the
hearing
and
thereby
insure
that
matters
of
this
will
not
be
made
public
prior
to
the
actual
trial.
as
you
know
today,
defense
counsel
has
a
mere
amount
of
tools
at
his
disposal
to
discover
the
government’s
case
against
the
individual.
and
any
defense
counsel
who
is
worthy
his
salt
can
certainly
learn
whether
or
not
there
is
a
confession.
he
can
also,
at
that
time,
make
a
adequate
presentation
to
the
court
that
not
only
should
preliminary
hearing
because
of
the
prosecution
in
and
off
itself
is
not
to
make
public
statements
about
the
nature
of
a
confession.
by
doing
this
in
this
manner,
this
type
of
an
error
simply
will
not
repeat
itself.
the
same
day
that
this
quote
appeared
in
the
morning
newspaper,
the
county
attorney
filed
a
motion
for
restrictive
order
which
requested
the
county
court
to
restrict
publication
of
testimony
to
be
presented
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
hearing
was
held
on
that
motion
the
same
evening.
attorney
representing
the
state,
the
defendant,
and
the
news
media
were
present.
the
defendant’s
attorney
advised
the
court
that
simants
joined
the
state's
motion
to
restrict
the
publication
of
testimony
from
a
preliminary
hearing.
he
even
went
a
step
further
and
asked
that
the
restrictive
order
be
brought
until
close
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
the
motion
of
the
defense
counsel
was
overruled.
the
motion
of
the
state
was
sustained.
the
next
day
--
mr.
harold
mosher
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
mosher
the
arraignment
is
the
first
--
mr.
harold
mosher
primarily,
the
only
function
of
that
is
to
set
a
time
for
preliminary
hearing
and
it
serves
a
second
function
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
accused
has
sufficient
funds
to
secure
the
services
of
an
attorney,
that
is
all
is
so
called
arraignment
does.
mr.
harold
mosher
none
whatsoever,
none
whatsoever.
the
court
just
simply
at
that
stage
of
the
game
merely
makes
an
inquiry
if
the
defendant
desires
an
attorney,
and
if
he
has,
to
secure
one
and
if
not,
an
application
at
that
time
is
made,
the
counsel
is
appointed,
and
the
date
for
the
preliminary
hearing
is
set.
mr.
harold
mosher
none
whatsoever,
absolutely
not.
mr.
harold
mosher
yes,
it
can
be
waived.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
doubt
it,
i
doubt
it.
it
probably
could
at
that
time
if
the
defendant
was
represented
by
counsel.
but
for
the
defendant
in
and
off
himself
to
waive
it
at
that
time,
i
do
not
know
if
the
court
would
allow
it.
we
have
never
had
a
precise
question
that
i
know
of
in
the
history
of
the
state.
mr.
harold
mosher
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
very
rarely,
very
rarely.
mr.
harold
mosher
that
is
correct.
the
purpose
of
the
preliminary
hearing
does
two
things.
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
government
to
prove
to
the
examining
magistrate,
one
that
crime
had
been
committed
and
two
that
there
is
probable
cause,
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
accused
committed
the
crime
charged.
if
there
is,
the
bind
over
goes
to
the
district
court
where
the
trial
is
held
on
the
merits.
mr.
harold
mosher
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
harold
mosher
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
mosher
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
harold
mosher
well,
he
may
in
a
given
case.
in
a
given
case,
the
counsel
may
be
very
well
appeal
that
the
evidence
produced
by
the
government
is
so
weak
that
it
could
be
exploited
at
that
level.
the
witnesses
can
be
shown
through
testimony.
i
have
seen
cases
in
which
that
is
exactly
where
this
case.
in
which
case
even
though
one
might
argue
that
on
its
face
the
government
presented
a
prima
facie
case.
the
fact
remains
that
the
trial
judge
who
holds
that
a
magistrate,
if
he
will,
has
the
credibility
as
the
trier
of
the
fact,
it
is
upon
him,
to
make
the
determination
of
what
witnesses
are
to
him
are
to
be
believed
and
whether
or
not
to
bind
over
should
call.
mr.
harold
mosher
normally
it
is
open
to
the
public,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
do
not
understand
your
question,
give
it
to
me
again.
mr.
harold
mosher
certainly.
mr.
harold
mosher
the
statute
in
and
off
itself
says
that
you
cannot
close
it
except
for
certain
reasons.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
in
its
december
1
opinion
in
this
case
has
said,
and
by
implementing
section
3.1,
the
american
bar
association
standards,
that
preliminary
hearing
can
be
closed
under
certain
circumstances
and
those
circumstances
are
the
one
which
are
enumerated
in
section
3.1.
the
next
day,
preliminary
hearing
was
held
on
amended
complaint
that
charged
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
further
charged
that
one
or
more
the
murderers
was
committed
in
the
perpetration
of
one
or
more
sexual
assault.
after
testimonies
of
several
witnesses
and
the
introduction
of
other
evidence,
simants
was
with
bound
over
to
the
district
court
for
trial.
the
very
next
day,
october
23rd,
attorneys
representing
the
media
in
(inaudible)
criminal
case
filed
a
motion
requesting
the
right
to
be
heard
on
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
restrictive
order.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
intervene
and
four
days
later
on
october
the
27th,
the
district
court
terminated
the
county
court's
order
and
imposed
one
of
its
own.
late
in
the
afternoon
of
friday,
october
the
31st,
1975,
the
petitioner
sought
relief
in
supreme
court
of
nebraska
on
two
procedural
routes.
they
filed
an
appeal
on
the
district
court's
order
and
at
the
same
time
they
filed
a
petition
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
for
a
leave
to
file
an
original
action
on
the
nature
of
a
writ
of
mandamus.
obviously
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
could
not
have
been
expected
to
award
to
the
parties
to
write
briefs
and
drive
over
two
hundred
miles
to
lincoln
and
to
give
oral
argument
on
these
two
cases
the
same
day
on
which
they
were
docketed
late
friday
afternoon
on
october
the
31st,
1975.
nor
did
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
be
expected
to
hear
the
cases
the
following
week
and
that
had
previously
called
more
than
50
cases
for
oral
argument
that
week.
it
is
hard
to
hear
argument
on
that
many
cases
as
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
divided
itself
in
two
divisions
and
it
brought
in
several
district
judges
to
help
with
the
case
load.
that
is
the
statement
on
page
21
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners
and
i
quote
that
“the
nebraska
supreme
court
refused
to
act
expeditiously
in
this
case”
is
simply
unfair
and
contrary
to
fact.
to
compound
the
problem
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
learned
while
the
two
cases
were
pending
in
its
court,
the
petitioners
have
previously
contacted
mr.
justice
blackmun
of
this
court,
as
justice
assigned
to
the
eight
circuit
and
asked
him
to
stay
the
order
entered
by
the
district
court
of
nebraska.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
immediately
issued
a
memorandum
opinion
in
which
it
noted
that
the
petitioners
were
seeking
concurrent
relief
in
both
this
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
and
caused
for
me
to
find
and
take
action
so
long
as
the
position
of
the
exercising
a
parallel
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
could
not
be
determined.
they,
however,
continue
the
action
until
this
court
may
have
known
whether
or
not
it
would
accept
jurisdiction.
on
november
13th,
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
his
capacity,
circuit
judge
issued
a
chamber’s
opinion
in
which
he
noted
the
desire
to
re-frame
punishment
or
denying
a
stay
until
the
nebraska
supreme
court
had
an
opportunity
to
act.
the
very
next
day,
november
14th,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
sent
the
original
action
for
mandamus
as
well
as
the
appeal
on
oral
argument
on
november
25th.
it
notified
counsel
to
file
typewritten
briefs
to
expedite
theory
and
thus
i
again
submit
to
you
that
its
safe
that
any
statement
attributed
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
that
it
failed
to
act
expeditiously
in
this
matter
simply
is
contrary
to
fact.
on
november
the
20th,
mr.
justice
blackmun
--
mr.
harold
mosher
not
really
your
honor.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
do
not
know,
i
am
not
privy
to
that
information,
so
that
i
cannot
answer.
i
can
tell
you
though
that
the
court
in
that
period
of
time
and
when
it
was
it
first
docketed
which
was
a
friday
on
october
31st,
the
following
week,
through
monday
and
tuesday
of
the
second
week
heard
50
some
cases,
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
53
and
that
is
a
terrible
case
load
for
any
court
to
carry
and
deliberate.
mr.
harold
mosher
it
does
not
help
you
in
this
case
at
all.
all
it
really
does
though
it
set
a
background
is
to
how
this
case
came
here
and
under
what
circumstances,
because
i
do
not
want
to
leave
you
with
the
impression,
nor
do
i
want
anyone
else
to
leave
you
as
impression,
but
somehow
none
of
the
courts
in
nebraska
were
derelict
in
this
matter.
they
simply
were
not.
mr.
harold
mosher
well,
i
think
this
was
an
exceptional
case.
mr.
harold
mosher
they
did.
mr.
harold
mosher
well,
your
honor,
when
you
call
50
cases
for
oral
argument,
there
is
just
no
way
to
stop
it.
mr.
harold
mosher
but
there
is
now
way
to
stop
it.
well,
you
have
got
53
cases
coming
in
for
arguments
the
next
day
and
these
attorneys
are
coming
in
from
all
over
of
the
state
at
minimum,
that
is
106
lawyers.[laughter]
there
is
no
way
to
stop
it.
each
of
these
lawyers
believes
he
too
has
exceptional
case.
mr.
harold
mosher
perhaps
that
could
have
been
done,
but
perhaps
also
your
honor
there
was
need
for
time
to
breach
the
matter.
mr.
harold
mosher
500
cases?
it
would
make
a
tremendous
difference.
mr.
harold
mosher
only
to
the
point
as
i
have
said
your
honor,
is
to
try
to
impress
upon
you
that
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
was
not
derelict,
but
let
us
turn
to
the
first
issue.
mr.
harold
mosher
well,
there
is
always
a
certain
time
line
your
honor.
there
has
to
be.
that
is
just
part
of
the
system,
but
to
say
that
10-11
days
in
unreasonable
i
do
not
consider
to
be.
someone
else
can
very
well
argue
that
it
is
unreasonable.
i
just
know
what
the
court
was
up
against.
i
just
know
that
they
heard
arguments
for
nine
days
and
before
then,
they
say
again
that
they
took
11
days
before
this
was
set
down
and
at
the
same
time
giving
the
attorneys
the
appropriate
time
to
reach
the
matter,
i
do
not
consider
to
be
unreasonable.
your
honor,
there
are
though
of
several
issues
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
them.
first,
is
the
first
very
basic
issue
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
courts
had
a
power
and
under
in
what
circumstances
to
enter
a
valid
protective
order.
the
answer
seems
to
me
unequivocal.
the
courts
do
have
the
power.
a
few
basic
consideration
seems
to
me
make
this
conclusion
absolutely
necessary.
one,
fair
administration
of
justice
is
one
of
the
most
essential
functions
of
government.
every
other
with
other
right
including
the
right
of
a
free
press
may
well
depend
upon
ability
to
get
a
judicial
hearing
that
is
dispassionate
and
as
an
impartial
as
a
weakness
inherent
men
will
permit.
two,
the
media
has
the
power,
whether
lawful
or
not,
to
destroy
the
right
to
a
fair
trail.
not
only
does
it
have
this
power,
but
it
has
been
exercised
as
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
sheppard
v.
maxwell.
three,
no
government
can
long
endure
if
it
can
permit
private
persons
or
persons
to
prevent
the
discharge
of
one
of
its
essential
functions.
the
press
has
taken
a
position
that
the
courts
have
no
power,
save
national
security,
to
issue
restrictive
orders.
that
position
i
submit
to
you
finds
no
support
whatever
in
the
constitution
in
the
united
states
nor
does
it
find
any
support
in
the
teachings
of
this
court.
two
dangerous
impressions
moreover
are
alleged
in
the
position
that
the
petitioners
have
taken
in
this
case.
one,
is
it
that
the
press
is
above
the
law,
and
the
other
is
that
the
people
in
the
government
are
antagonistic,
that
the
press
must
somehow
protect
the
people
from
the
government.
i
submit
to
you
that
these
impressions
are
based
upon
some
misconceptions.
a
fundamental
principle
of
american
law
and
from
anglo-american
law
for
at
least
700
years
is
that
no
one
is
above
the
law
and
certainly,
neither
the
constitution
nor
the
people
are
conferred
upon
private
corporations,
whether
engaged
in
a
publishing
or
the
broadcasting
business
or
any
other
business,
a
status
that
not
even
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
can
claim.
all
are
under
the
law
and
none
has
the
right
in
its
sole
discretion
to
prevent
the
judicial
branch
or
any
other
branch
of
the
government
in
carrying
out
its
assigned
functions.
secondly,
america’s
greatest
claim
to
freedom,
to
its
place
and
history
is
its
government
other
people,
by
the
people
and
for
the
people.
is
that
the
government
who
is
at
the
control
of
the
people,
the
people
want
and
they
need
the
news
media
to
assist
them
in
this
process,
but
only
under
the
law
and
not
above
it.
freedom
of
the
press
simply
is
not
absolute
and
absolute
discretion
is
granted
to
no
one
under
the
constitution.
ours
is
the
government
of
laws.
it
is
not
a
government
of
men.
thus
it
cannot
seriously
be
doubted
that
the
courts
have
the
power
to
render
valid
protective
orders.
that
critical
issue
is
under
what
circumstances
can
a
restrictive
order
be
entered
and
what
should
be
its
scope.
the
issue
here
is
delicate.
it
is
a
delicate
balancing
of
interest
between
the
first
and
sixth
amendment.
this
is
where
the
courts
and
media
must
give
careful
consideration
to
the
important
functions
that
media
performs.
perhaps
a
good
place
to
start
is
the
preliminary
hearing.
this
is
a
likely
source
of
most
restrictive
orders.
as
i
have
previously
alluded
to
you
under
nebraska
law,
one
who
believes
he
had
been
unjustly
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
has
a
right
for
a
prompt
preliminary
hearing
before
a
magistrate.
in
that
particular
hearing,
the
government
does
have
the
burden
proving
one,
whether
or
not
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
two
whether
or
not
a
person
charged
committed
the
crime.
the
dissemination
of
public
information
at
that
stage
of
the
trial
can
in
appropriate
case
create
habit
in
providing
a
defendant
with
a
fair
trial
because
frequently
at
such
hearings
there
is
testimony
relating
to
confessions,
and
i
call
your
attention
to
several
empirical
studies,
empirical
studies
which
are
cited
on
pages
10
and
11
of
the
brief
for
the
respondent
stuart,
which
demonstrate
how,
the
publication
of
a
confession
or
the
fact
that
one
has
been
given
can
in
a
particular
case
deny
that
criminal
defendant
a
fair
trial.
in
the
case
of
estes
versus
texas
this
court
itself
had
that
the
pretrial
can
create
a
major
problem
for
the
defendant
in
criminal
case.
indeed,
the
court
went
on
to
state
a
pretrial
publicity
may
be
more
harmful
than
publicity
during
the
trial
for
it
may
well
set
the
community
opinion
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
harold
mosher
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
give
you
a
yes
or
no
answer
your
honor.
it
will
depend
on
an
awful
lot
on
the
facts
in
a
particular
case.
in
this
particular
case
that
you
have
before
you,
no
eyewitnesses
survived
and
so
the
case,
the
government
was
going
to
make
much
of
the
case,
certainly
a
confession
was
certainly
a
way
of
doing
it.
there
were
simply
no
eyewitnesses
to
this
heinous
crime.
mr.
harold
mosher
it
was,
pardon
me,
it
was.
the
culprits
of
possible
prejudice
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
restricted
the
petitions
for
publishing
confessions
and
admissions.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
did
not
restrict
the
petitioners
from
publishing
that
six
persons
had
been
culled,
or
that
six
persons
that
had
been
slain
in
their
homes.
it
did
not
restrict
the
news
media
from
investigating
any
portion
of
the
crime.
it
did
not
restrict
the
newspaper
and
the
news
media
from
publishing
the
names
of
the
victims,
their
age,
or
their
sex,
or
that
erwin
charles
simants
has
been
arrested.
mr.
harold
mosher
all
they
could
--
probably
they
publish
immediately,
of
course
your
honor,
under
the
terms
of
this
particular
restricting
order
just
as
soon
the
jury
was
impaneled.
mr.
harold
mosher
certainly.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
think
it
is
probably
one
of
the
gray.
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
gray.
the
newspapers
in
this
nation
really
do
enjoy
the
tremendous
sense
of
credibility.
mr.
harold
mosher
what
is
that?
what
was
in
the
public
hearing?
mr.
harold
mosher
but
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
constitution
that
a
preliminary
hearing
be
a
public
hearing.
the
sixth
amendment
only
goes
to
a
public
trial.
mr.
harold
mosher
the
law
of
nebraska
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harold
mosher
well,
even
the
press
that
the
way
case
was
developed
was
entitled
to
attend.
mr.
harold
mosher
certainly,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
mosher
but
your
honor,
it
was
not
a
total
restriction.
it
was
a
merely
restriction
until
the
jury
was
impaneled
and
placed
in
a
box.
at
that
stage
of
the
game
the
press
was
freed
and
let
it
all
hang
out.
there
was
nothing
to
restrict
to
matter,
the
jury
was
in
the
box.
it
was
simply
an
attempt,
a
very
sincere
attempt
of
balance
the
first
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
harold
mosher
that
is
one
and
the
other
thing
i
think
why
it
was
very
narrow
is
they
restricted
the
publication
on.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
do
not
believe
so
at
all.
i
think
all
the
court
was
really
saying
is
here
is
that
one,
you
cannot
publish
before
this,
before
this
matter
goes
to
the
--
before
the
jury
is
impaneled.
one,
any
admissions
against
interest
or
confessions,
and
two
you
cannot
publish
the
fact
that
the
man
had
had
a
prayer
of
general
conduct.
this
is
all
the
--
mr.
harold
mosher
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor,
because
the
second
one
for
example,
let
the
media
publish
anything
that
is
--
mr.
harold
mosher
i
do
not
know
the
scope
of
your
question
because
watergate
involved
a
lot
--
mr.
harold
mosher
well,
of
course,
watergate
involved
a
tremendous
amount
of
investigation
by
the
media
before
government
acted,
but
probably
watergate
is
the
media’s
finest
hour.
certainly
it
is
one
of
its
finest
hours,
because
here
are
some
investigations
that
went
on
by
the
media
before
the
government
acted
to
set
the
criminal
process
in
action.
this
was
not
the
case
here.
the
government
had
set
an
action.
the
government
had
arrested
a
person
that
they
believe
--
mr.
harold
mosher
that
is
a
narrow
order.
mr.
harold
mosher
the
terms
of
the
order
prohibit
the
media
in
publishing
before
the
jury
is
impaneled,
from
publishing
a
fact
that
this
man
had
confessed.
it
also
prohibited
the
media
from
publishing
such
other
matters
except
in
those
statements
that
they
might
get
from
the
accused.
now,
if
the
accused
was
willing
to
talk
to
the
media
they
were
perfectly
free
to
publish
it.
mr.
harold
mosher
oh!
i
think
he
probably
could,
certainly.
mr.
harold
mosher
it
did,
which
of
course,
would
go
to
the
prior
criminal
conduct
of
the
accused.
mr.
harold
mosher
i
think
so.
