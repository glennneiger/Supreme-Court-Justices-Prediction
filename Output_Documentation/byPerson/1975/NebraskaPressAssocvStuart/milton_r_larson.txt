mr.
milton
r.
larson
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
milton
larson.
i
am
the
prosecutor
in
this
action
and
i
am
here
representing
the
state
of
nebraska.
i
believe
that,
insofar
as
the
factual
background,
mr.
mosher
has
done
a
very
good
job
in
laying
forth
the
situation.
the
one
thing
that
he
did
not
mention
in
terms
of
whether
the
state
may
have
overreacted
to
some
publicity.
i
was
called
to
sutherland
on
the
evening
of
october
18th,
assisted
in
the
criminal
investigation.
the
bodies
were
in
the
house
from
approximately
10
o’clock
when
i
got
there
until
4:30
the
next
morning.
everything
left
just
as
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
criminal
investigation
underway
and
completed
and
before
the
bodies
were
removed,
there
was
an
nbc
helicopter
from
denver
that
had
arrived.
there
were
news,
media
representatives
from
the
wire
services,
ap,
upi,
omaha
world-herald,
all
of
the
local
radio
stations,
television.
it
was
very
apparent,
very
early
that
i
was
going
to
be
faced
with
a
good
deal
of
publicity.
in
this
regard,
i
would
like
to
narrow
the
issues
here
a
little
bit.
i
think
that
we
need
to
say
that
we
are
talking
here
only
about
the
very
exceptional
case
in
the
criminal
arena,
unfortunately
the
sensational
case,
the
highly
publicized
case.
however,
we
are
also
talking
therefore
about
the
major
cases.
the
ones
that
the
public
presumably
the
going
to
be
the
most
interested
in.
certainly
this
case,
involving
the
mass
murder
of
six
people,
involving
sexual
assaults
on
children
and
an
elderly
woman
both
before
and
after
death
must
fall
within
the
realm
of
an
exceptional
case.
you
have
to
couple
that,
unlike
the
watergate
situations
that
happened
in
a
metropolitan
area
where
everyone
is
not
terribly
concerned
about
it.
here
we
have
a
situation
in
a
town
of
800
where
virtually
everyone
knows
everyone.
the
people
in
the
community
knew
both
the
accused
and
all
of
the
victims.
they
were
very
vitally
interested
in
it.
they
were
going
to
learn
all
that
they
could
and
rightfully
so.
they
would
want
to
learn
all
that
they
could,
but
that
adds
to
the
prosecutions’
burden
of
protecting
the
individual’s
right
to
a
fair
trial.
i
do
not
mean
to
sound
as
a
defense
attorney,
but
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
felt
that
it
was
the
burden
of
the
prosecution
as
well
and
i
think
that
is
clearly
indicated
in
sheppard
to
take
reasonable
steps
as
i
felt
were
necessary
to
protect
the
individual’s
right
to
a
fair
trial.
i
do
also
wish
to
reemphasize
the
fact
that
i
did
not,
at
any
time
state
that
the
defendant
had
made
a
statement
and
i
am
very
happy
to
report
that
because
it
would
have
been
highly
embarrassing
had
i
done
that.
i
was
misquoted
on
that.
then
with
regard
to
the
pervasiveness
of
the
county
court's
order,
he
simply
said,
you
shall
not
report
what
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
except
as
in
compliance
to
the
bar
press
guidelines.
you
have
to
take
that
into
account
in
terms
of
the
circumstances
there.
nebraska
has
a
statute
requiring
that
if
a
man
is
held
without
bond
that
he
shall
be
entitled
to
a
preliminary
hearing
within
four
days.
that
is
not
very
much
time.
by
the
time
we
got
even
organized,
i
have
a
four-man
staff,
by
the
time
i
even
got
organized
to
consider
the
procedural
problems
of
due
process
and
fair
trial
and
the
sixth
amendment,
it
was
monday.
i
had
to
have
the
preliminary
hearing
tuesday,
and
so
i
asked,
i
simply
put
a
motion
on
and
said,
your
honor,
i
just
request
that
the
order
--
that
the
court
enter
whatever
order
it
deems
necessary
to
protect
this
individual’s
right
to
a
fair
trial.
and
the
judge
looked
at
it
and
he
said,
my
gosh,
i
see
the
problem.
in
the
meantime,
i
have
received
calls
from
the
chicago
tribune,
la
sun-times,
the
london
sunday-times,
nbc,
abc,
everyone
and
i
was
very
much
appalled
that
what
was
going
to
transpire.
so
the
judge
said,
obviously,
this
needs
to
be
considered.
obviously,
i
have
not
much
time,
call
of
the
media
that
are
here
and
that
are
represented,
asked
them
to
come
to
the
court
this
evening
and
we
are
going
to
talk
this
over
and
he
came
in,
he
ultimately
decided
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
make
any
extensive
study
of
the
law
in
the
area
and
he
said,
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
get
a
review
from
the
district
court
and
i
am
just
going
to
shut
it
down
and
you
can
get
your
review
there.
the
following
morning,
we
had
our
preliminary
hearing.
the
following
evening,
we
had
a
hearing
as
to
the
--
we
had
a
review
of
the
county
court's
order
and
the
district
judge
also
said,
this
order
is
over
broad,
but
i
do
not
know
how
over
broad
it
is
because
i
am
not
right
up-to-date
on
everything
with
regard
to
free-press
and
fair
trial.
so
i
want
to
postpone
this
matter
until
october
27th,
that
was
four
days,
request
that
counsel
give
me
some
guidelines,
give
me
their
thoughts
as
to
what
ought
to
go
into
the
order
and
if
they
ought
not
to
be
in
order,
what
those
--
the
basis
for
that
is
and
on
october
27th,
he
modified
the
order
which
was
five
days
after
the
original
order
had
been
entered
and
i
think
under
the
circumstances
he
got
it
on
wednesday,
gave
thursday
and
friday
for
the
people
to
get
--
the
people
involved
to
get
their
information
together
as
to
what
they
want
to
put
before
the
judge.
then
on
october
27th,
at
which
he
entered
his
order
and
the
heard
arguments
as
to
its
validity
and
what
ought
to
be
in
it,
and
what
ought
not
to
be
in
it
and
decided
to
go
with
the
bar-press
guidelines.
and
justice
blackmun,
i
think
correctly
stated,
that
they
are
over
broad
because
they
are
not
specific
enough
in
all
areas.
if
you
are
going
to
be
charged
with
contempt
you
certainly
ought
to
know
what
you
are
being
charged
with
and
i
could
not
agree
more.
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct.
so,
it
was
limited
to
confessions,
confessions
made
to
law
enforcement
people,
confessions
made
to
others,
and
to
those
facts
strongly
implicative
of
this
defendant.
now,
justice
stevens
question
is
that
would
on
its
face
appear
to
be
rather
pervasive,
but
i
would
submit
that
it
is
not
when
applied
to
the
facts
to
the
case
itself.
basically,
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing
all
we
have
was
the
confession
of
the
defendant.
all
of
the
physical
evidence
that
was
to
later
corroborate
the
confession,
the
fibers
that
were
found
from
his
coat,
that
were
found
on
the
bodies
of
the
defendants
and
etcetera,
this
was
all
being
packaged
and
being
sent
to
the
fbi
laboratory
in
washington
d.c.
we
had
nothing
at
the
time
of
the
preliminary
hearing
to
secure
a
probable
cause
for
the
bind
over
of
this
defendant,
except,
nothing
exculpatory
except
his
confession
which
is
sufficient
for
establishing
probable
cause,
to
bind
him
over.
but
with
regard
to
the
questions
that
are
involved
here,
i
think
what
comes
into
conflict
are
the
two
rules
of
law.
one
that
that
which
transpires
in
the
open
courtroom
is
maybe
published
with
impunity
and
two,
that
where
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
prejudicial
news
coverage
that
the
judge
shall
take
those
steps
as
are
required
to
protect
the
right
to
a
fair
trial.
clearly,
none
of
the
cases
have
indicated
that
there
is
any
indication
toward
prior
restraint
that
that
it
is
all
desirable.
that
i
submit
in
exceptional
cases
where
locale
and
circumstance
combine
such
that
pervasive
publicity,
extensive
publicity
and
prejudicial
publicity
would
or
create
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
the
impaneling
of
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
that
that
must
necessarily
that
the
judge
must
necessarily
have
the
authority
to
enter
any
appropriate
order.
mr.
milton
r.
larson
no
your
honor,
i
presume
what
is
your
getting
to
now
is
the
rumor
in
innuendo
that
goes
in
the
absence
of
a
court,
and
is
that
correct?
mr.
milton
r.
larson
no,
and
my
answer
to
that
and
it
is
only
a
feeling,
but
i
think
it
is
correct
that
that
which
mrs.
jones
tells
me,
i
am
going
to
be
more
easily
convinced
to
put
aside
than
if
i
have
read
in
the
papers
in
the
headlines,
evidence
established
at
preliminary
hearing
shows
that
a
confession
was
made.
i
think
that
once
it
has
given
the
sanction
of
the
judicial
proceeding
when
it
has
given
the
sanction
of
the
written
word
in
the
paper
recorded
under
judicial
proceedings
that
it
is
much
more
devastating
to
the
rights
of
criminal
defendant
to
a
fair
trial.
mr.
milton
r.
larson
yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
that
as
a
practical
matter,
anyone
who
was
from
sutherland
was
removed
for
cause
without
opposition
by
the
prosecution
because
of
that
very
reason.
mr.
milton
r.
larson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
r.
larson
you
cannot
stop
it
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
not
going
to
be
as
prejudicial
as
what
comes
out
in
the
paper
that
judicial
proceedings
have
indicated
that
a
confession
was
made.
in
regard
to
the
confession
itself,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
a
confession,
in
an
exceptional
case,
such
as
we
have
before
us
uniquely
lends
itself
to
a
restriction
in
the
pretrial
proceeding.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
we
are
talking
about
pretrial
here.
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
basis
during
the
trial
of
precluding
publicity
because
obviously
the
jury
can
be
sequestered
at
that
time,
they
do
not
need
to
have
access
to
that
information.
but
we
are
talking
about
pretrial
and
we
do
not
know
who
the
perspective
jurors
are
going
to
be
and
we
do
know
though
what
type
of
information
they
are
going
to
have
at
their
disposal.
i
would
submit,
your
honors
that
in
light
of
the
four-day
requirement,
in
light
of
the
fact
of
necessity
had
to
introduce
the
confession
at
the
preliminary
hearing
in
order
to
get
a
bind
over,
that
it
can
be
hardly
said
as
petitioners
would
have
believe
that
we
volunteered
that
information
for
dissemination
to
the
public.
as
a
matter
of
prosecution,
as
a
matter
of
getting
my
job
done,
there
was
no
--
i
had
no
alternative,
but
to
introduce
confession.
so,
when
you
--
mr.
milton
r.
larson
no,
your
honor,
that
was
the
next
point
that
i
was
going
to
make,
due
process
before
the
admission
of
a
confession,
into
the
trial
portion,
requires
a
due
process
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
with
relationship
to
voluntariness,
that
was
held.
but
i
would
submit
to
you
that
that
would
be
a
very
little
moment
if
the
confession
had
already
been
published
and
the
jurors
already
have
knowledge
of
it,
because
i
would
submit
that
what
would
go
up
to
the
mind
of
the
juror,
if
they
went
to
the
trial
and
no
confession
was
introduced,
was
not
that
there
must
not
have
been
a
confession,
but
rather
that,
well,
that
prosecutor
did
not
introduce
said
confession,
but
i
know
it
was
made
and
i
think
that
type
of
prejudice
simply
cannot
be
over
come.
and
i
think
that
the
issue,
the
basic
issue
here
is
that
in
the
exceptional
case
who
shall
govern,
who
shall
have
ultimate
authority
to
protect
the
due
process
requirements
with
relationship
to
a
fair
trial.
shall
it
be,
the
courts,
shall
it
be
the
judiciary
or
shall
it
be
the
editor?
i
would
submit
that
before
public
dissemination
of
information
relative
to
the
existence
of
a
confession
can
be
or
should
be
disseminated
that
the
question
of
voluntariness
should
first
be
determined,
in
the
first
instance
by
the
judiciary,
not
by
editorial
comment.
and
that
again,
i
am
talking
about
exceptional
cases,
highly
publicized
issues,
i
am
talking
about
this
case
gentleman,
where
in
a
small
rural
community
we
had
a
mass
murder
of
a
scope
that
was
unprecedented
in
nebraska
since
the
starkweather
case
in
1957.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
ever
there
was
a
situation
where
there
could
be
a
limited
prior
restraint,
and
again
we
must
say
limited,
i
feel
that
as
i
think
it
clearly
the
law,
it
can
be
no
more
pervasive
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
insure
the
judicial
process
and
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
and
that
is
really
what
we
are
talking
about.
is
the
ultimate
power
of
the
courts
to
control
their
own
processes
to
insure
that
due
process
of
the
law
is
met.
i
think
that
we
should
talk
about
the
estes
case,
the
rideau
case,
the
sheppard
case
which
indicate
that
due
process,
that
actual
prejudice
need
not
be
shown
where
a
due
process
demands
a
reversal
because
of
prejudicial
publicity.
