what
are
the
local
media
in
the
lincoln
county?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
local
media
right
in
this
town?
justice
potter
stewart
is
north
platte
is
the
county
seat?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
newspaper
and
what,
two
or
three
radio
stations?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
trial,
once
the
jury
was
impaneled
and
sworn
it
was
sequestered?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
trial,
i
suppose
was
fully
reported
by
the
news
media,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
if
there
is
a
new
trial,
the
community
has
been
apprised,
there
are
things
that
came
out
in
open
court?
justice
potter
stewart
voir
dire
of
the
question
for
a
change
of
venue
that
was
denied?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
read
in
the
briefs?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
the
nebraska
law,
the
change
of
venue
could
be
only
to
an
adjacent
county,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
abrams,
before
you
proceed,
i
think
perhaps
i
miss
something.
you
were
telling
us
of
the
demonstrable
sea
change
in
traditional
latitude
in
recent
years
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
then
you
told
us,
why
was
not
it
attributable
to
this
and
not
attributable
to
that
and
not
attributable
to
the
other
thing.
what
i
missed
i
think
was
your
henry
ending
[laughter]
what
was
it
attributable
too?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mosher,
you
have
i
gather
two
hearings
in
nebraska
prior
to
the
trial
at
least
two,
one
is
in
arraignment
and
the
other
is
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
which
comes
first?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
the
function
and
purpose
of
an
arraignment?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
evidence
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
pleading?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
he
plead?
justice
potter
stewart
not
until
then?
justice
potter
stewart
he
does
not
do
it
in
the
arraignment?
he
does
not
do
it
in
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
generally
the
defendant
does
not
introduce
any
evidence
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
does
he?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
our
decision
in
the
rideau
case
was
erroneous?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
issue
there
was
whether
or
not
he
was
unconstitutionally
entitled
to
a
change
of
venue
--
