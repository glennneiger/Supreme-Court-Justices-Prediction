mr.
mosher,
is
not
11
days
a
pretty
long
time
under
the
circumstances?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
excuse
given
as
i
remember
was
that
they
had
some
kind
of
seminar
to
attend?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
not
the
order
contained
word
such
as
‘seriously
implicative’?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
to
me
sounds
a
little
more
narrower
than
mr.
justice
stevens’
description
of
tending
to
prove
guilt?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
prettyman,
i
suppose
your
position,
if
you
prevail
here
will
be
to
increase
the
number
of
closed
hearings.
now,
you
said
a
while
ago
that
that
is
another
case,
it
would
argument
against
this
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
but
is
this
a
privilege
for
the
press
to
assert
or
for
the
defense
to
assert?
