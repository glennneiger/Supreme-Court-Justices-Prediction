mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
i
represent
a
group
of
newspapers,
press
and
broadcasting
associations;
up,
ap,
sigma
delta
tau
chapter
and
several
individual
journalists.
mr.
floyd
abrams
is
with
me
representing
certain
amici
will
also
argue
for
a
reversal
in
this
case.
the
basic
question
before
the
court
is
whether
it
is
permissible
under
the
first
amendment
for
a
court
to
issue
a
direct
prior
restraint
against
the
press,
prohibiting
in
advance
a
publication
or
reporting
of
information
revealed
in
public
court
proceedings,
public
court
records
and
from
other
sources
about
pendent
judicial
proceedings.
the
case
arose
out
of
multiple
murders.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
certainly
think
that
under
any
definition
your
honor,
it
applies
here
and
that
is,
it
is
in
this
case
at
least,
it
is
an
order
not
to
print
certain
information
in
advance
of
that
information
being
printed.
this
case
as
i
said
arose
out
multiple
murders
in
lincoln
county
in
nebraska
back
in
october,
1975.
the
suspect,
a
man
named
simants
was
arrested
the
following
morning
which
was
a
sunday
and
on
monday
and
tuesday
as
would
be
normally
expected,
there
are
a
number
of
stories,
factual
in
nature
appeared
in
the
local
media.
they
told
about
his
arrest.
they
mentioned
that
the
lincoln
county
attorney
have
said
that
mr.
simants
had
made
a
statement.
the
lincoln
county
attorney
had
said
that
he
had
a
theory
about
the
motive
which
would
be
brought
out
when
the
autopsy
was
completed
and
it
was
also
reported
that
one
person
had
said
that
simants
father
had
told
him
that
simants
had
told
the
father
the
he
had
committed
the
killings.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
actually,
there
is
no
newspaper
in
sutherland,
the
small
town
of
800
where
it
occurred.
the
north
platte
telegraph
is
the
nearest
newspaper.
there
are
a
number
of
other
newspapers
from
omaha
and
denver
and
so
forth
which
permeate
--
which
come
into
the
state.
there
are
a
number
of
radio
stations
and
there
are
also
several
television
stations.
i
think
we
can
assume
for
present
purposes
that
all
the
media
were
in
the
state.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
in
sutherland.
in
north
platte
there
is
a
newspaper.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
it
is
not
very
far
away.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
north
platte
telegraph.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding,
yes
sir.
on
the
tuesday
evening,
the
prosecutor,
in
advance
of
a
preliminary
hearing
that
was
expected
the
next
day,
moved
for
a
prior
restraint
in
the
county
court.
no
evidence
was
admitted
to
back
it
up.
the
county
court
entered
an
order
the
following
day
in
which
he
said
that
because
of
the
reasonable
likelihood
of
prejudicial
news
that
would
make
it
difficult,
if
not
impossible
to
impanel
an
impartial
jury,
he
was
entering
the
order.
it
was
a
very
broad
order.
it
prohibited
not
only
any
evidence
that
would
come
forward
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
but
any
evidence
apart
from
the
preliminary
hearing
except
as
would
be
allowed
in
certain
voluntary
press-bar
guidelines
that
were
then
in
effect
in
nebraska.
that
order
would
have
remained
in
effect
even
after
trial.
as
a
result
of
that
order
which
the
press
chose
to
obey,
the
press
could
not
report
the
following
day
what
happened
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
even
though
it
was
an
open
preliminary
hearing.
the
public
was
there,
the
press
was
there,
anybody
who
wanted
to
be,
could
be
there
and
could
leave
and
go
out
and
tell
anybody
he
wanted
to
what
had
happened,
but
the
press
was
prohibited
from
reporting
what
had
occurred.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
are
in
a
strange
situation
in
regard
to
closed
hearings
there
because
you
have
a
statute
that
says
that
it
had
to
be
open,
but
the
nebraska
supreme
court
in
this
case
seems
to
be
interpreting
in
a
way
that
seems
to
allow
to
have
been
closed.
certainly
the
judge
at
the
time
thought
that
that
hearing
had
to
be
open.
i
would
argue
with
you
in
a
different
case
that
it
had
to
be
open
constitutionally,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
there
is
nothing
before
you
in
regard
to
the
closed
hearing
problem.
since
the
simants
case
was
actually
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
you
must
say
that
there
are
certainly
--
i
would
certainly
argue
that
there
are
many
alternatives
available.
i
would
certainly
hope
that
you
would
bank
on
the
sheppard
type
alternatives
and
not
on
closed
hearings.
i
think
a
closed
hearing
is
the
hand-made
until
the
prior
restraint
and
certainly
when
they
used
either
alternatively
or
even
worse,
hand
in
glove
with
each
other,
then
you
have
really
effectively
stopped
the
complete
flow
of
news.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
again,
your
honor,
that
is
not
this
case.
i
want
to
stress
it
because
there
is
no
such
order
in
effect
here.
it
is
an
alternative
that
was
suggested
in
sheppard.
in
a
different
case,
i
might
be
before
you
arguing
that
that
is
impermissible,
but
again,
it
is
not
this
case.
i
certainly
agree
that
it
was
an
alternative
suggested
in
sheppard.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
a
prior
restraint
on
the
prosecutor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
i
certainly
think
not
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
the
prior
restraint
on
the
prosecutor,
you
have
a
free
speech
problem
for
the
prosecutor,
but
you
do
not
have
the
direct
prior
restraint
on
the
press
that
you
have
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
insofar
as
this
case
is
important,
i
do
not
know
that
the
label
means
very
much,
but
what
actually
occurred
is
of
extreme
importance,
that
is
you
have
directly
prohibited
the
press
from
publishing
a
certain
information.
now,
whether
you
want
that
label
or
some
other,
that
is
the
issue
here
whether
you
can
do
that
under
the
first
amendment?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
may
well
be
--
that
is
correct
and
in
the
next
case
you
may
have
to
decide
that,
but
certainly,
if
you
are
going
to
have
prior
restraints,
the
one
that
is
worst,
the
one
that
affects
the
public
the
most,
the
most
onerous
one
is
the
one
that
is
the
direct
prior
restraint
on
the
press
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
new
york
times
and
university
of
minnesota
and
in
a
lot
of
other
cases.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
just
as
you
can
restrict
the
press
in
a
courtroom
too,
from
not
sitting
inside
the
bar
and
from
doing
a
number
of
--
taking
pictures
and
from
doing
a
number
of
things.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely,
there
is
no
question,
but
that
you
can
impose
some
restrictions
on
the
press.
the
court
has
always
distinguished
between
those
incidental
restrictions
and
the
direct
prior
restraint,
forbidding
a
newspaper
not
to
publish.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
you
have
directly
have
applied
the
same
standards
here
before.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
order
that
i
have
just
described
was
not
the
order
before
you.
i
am
going
through
the
four
orders
and
to
give
you
a
feeling
of
the
difficulty
of
this
area
because
four
orders
have
been
entered
in
this
case
and
they
are
all
different.
because
of
that
county
court,
because
of
the
trial
was
going
to
be
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioners
here
went
to
the
district
court
and
asked
for
him
to
strike
the
county
court
order
and
the
district
court
entered
its
own
order
and
its
grounds
was
because
of
the
nature
of
the
crimes
charged.
he
said
that
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
the
pretrial
publicity
could
impinge
on
defendant’s
right
to
a
fair
trial.
he
also
included
those
guidelines
as
part
of
his
order,
but
he
changed
a
number
of
items
and
said
for
example
that
we
could
not
report
the
identity
of
persons
sexually
assaulted
in
connection
with
these
murders.
that
order
would
have
remained
in
effect
until
after
the
jury
was
sworn.
after
a
number
of
procedural
problems
with
which
the
court
is
fully
familiar
and
it
does
not
bother
us
now
so
i
would
not
go
through
them.
mr.
justice
blackmun
entered
an
order
granting
in
part
and
staying
in
part
the
district
court's
order.
he
eliminated
the
guidelines
as
being
too
broad
and
vague
and
he
did
allow
certain
information
to
be
published,
but
he
also
prohibited
the
publication
of
other
items,
including
facts
strongly
implicated
with
the
accused
or
facts
highly
prejudicial
to
the
accused.
that
order
was
then
succeeded
by
the
fourth
order
which
is
the
one
that
is
before
you
and
that
order
is
the
one
of
the
nebraska
supreme
court
entered
on
december
1,
1975.
it
too,
eliminated
the
guidelines,
but
it
prohibited
the
publication
of
the
existence
or
content
of
confessions
or
admissions
against
interest,
made
by
the
accused
to
law
enforcement
officers
or
the
third
parties
except
to
the
press.
and
it
also
prohibited,
“other
information
strongly
implicative
of
the
accused
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
slain,”
whatever
that
means
and
we
are
not
sure.
that
applied
interestingly
only
to
petitioners
and
not
to
all
the
other
media
and
it
was
effective
only
as
to
events
which
had
occurred
prior
to
the
entry
of
the
order.
as
a
result
of
all
four
of
these
orders,
the
press
was
prohibited
from
publishing
information,
most
of
it
coming
from
public
records
and
public
hearings
for
over
eleven
weeks.
the
trial
followed
and
mr.
simants
was
found
guilty.
now,
insofar
as
this
nebraska
supreme
court
order
prohibited
the
publication
of
news,
developed
in
an
open-court
hearing
or
from
open
court
records,
i
just
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
question
and
i
submit
to
you,
it
is
very
clear
that
is
blatantly
unconstitutional
under
craig
versus
harney
and
estes
versus
texas
and
cox
broadcast.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it
is
my
understanding
that
has
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct,
your
honor,
correct.
in
which
case
i
assume
the
same
order
would
be
entered
again
if
this
court
allowed
it
to
do
so.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
was.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
small
community,
that
community
was
apprised
of
everything
about
this
event,
with
or
without
the
media.
the
gossip
and
rumors
are
clearly
indicated
in
the
newspapers
and
in
the
record.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
order
has
expired.
i
would
assume
that
you
would
have
already
made
the
decision
that
this
is
not
a
moot
case
because
if
you
recall,
we
moved
the
court
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
order
for
an
expedited
hearing.
we
offered
to
have
briefs
to
you
in
the
typewritten
form
the
next
day
to
have
immediate
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
that
issue
i
assume
you
have
already
passed
on
because
you
put
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
it
is
a
live
case
because
not
only
for
the
reason
mentioned
by
mr.
blackmun
that
this
order
could
be
entered
again
in
regard
to
this
very
person,
but
that
orders
are
coming
down
from
all
over
the
country.
we
have
had
eleven
of
them
in
the
last
six
months
and
this
a
problem
which
is
typically
under
your
decisions
of
such
short
duration
that
unless
you
are
going
to
take
these
and
face
these
and
rule
on
them
now,
they
are
just
going
to
continue
into
an
effect
and
expire
before
you
can
take
one
that
is
alive.
i
think
it
is
not
only
capable
of
repetition,
but
it
is
being
repeated
everyday.
we
just
had
one
entered
the
other
day
in
nebraska.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
have
done
that
your
honor
and
in
response
that,
i
would
simply
say
that
in
carroll,
that
case
was
moot
in
java
on
the
third
circuit,
that
case
was
moot
and
the
court
nevertheless
took
it
and
decided
it
and
i
would
assume
it
did
so
on
two
grounds.
and
judge
cassel
incidentally
also
did
it
in
a
district
court
after
the
firing
of
mr.
catz
and
it
did
it
on
two
grounds.
one
was
that
it
could
actually
apply
to
the
parties
in
the
same
sense
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
just
pointed
out,
but
also
that
issue
was
of
such
moment
and
was
occurring
again
in
other
situations
and
was
otherwise
so
incapable
of
being
decided
quickly,
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
court
to
hear
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
a
kind
of
exception,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
get
that
purport.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
you
decide
that
prior
restraint
is
impermissible.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
certainly
could.
you
might
--
i
would
be
very
surprised
because
i
do
not
see
how
the
publicity
in
this
case
could
conceivably
be
called
excessive.
it
was
very
factual
and
it
was
limited,
but
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
you
could
take
the
case
and
reverse
it
on
that
ground,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
right,
sure.
i
emphasize
that
insofar
as
the
order
prohibited
what
occurred
in
open
court,
it
seems
to
be
you
have
already
ruled
on
it
and
you
have
said
that
is
impermissible.
but
this
order
went
further
as
i
have
said
and
would
keep
us
from
talking
to
people
and
finding
out
things
about
this
judicial
proceeding,
and
therefore,
i
have
to
go
further.
and
i
think
in
order
to
make
the
point,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
the
fact
that
this
is
the
press
somehow
is
giving
the
courts
a
strange
impression
that
you
could
enter
these
orders
that
they
would
not
do
under
other
circumstances.
let
us
just
suppose
for
a
moment,
that
very
minister,
priest
and
rabbi
in
lincoln
county
had
gotten
to
--
everyone
of
them
had
gotten
together
a
couple
of
weeks
before
this
gentleman’s
trial
and
they
had
decided
that
mr.
simants
was
the
embodiment
of
the
devil
and
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
do
something
about
it.
they
will
going
to
make
him
a
symbol
and
that
they
were
going
to
get
together
on
the
next
sunday
or
saturday
in
their
pulpits
and
they
will
going
to
reveal
his
confession.
they
are
going
to
reveal
the
sexual
nature
of
his
crimes.
they
were
going
to
condemn
him
as
guilty
and
the
they
are
going
to
ask
the
death
penalty.
and
in
order
for
me
to
make
my
point
if
you
will
assume
with
me
that
all
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
people
in
lincoln
county
went
to
their
churches
and
synagogues
that
is
next
sunday.
is
there
any
question,
but
that
this
court
would
sanction
a
prior
restraint
on
the
giving
of
those
sermons.
i
do
not
think
that
any
judge
would
say
that
you
could
enjoin
those
people
from
getting
up
in
their
pulpits
and
talking
about
his
confession.
and
yet
somehow,
it
somehow
does
not
seems
so
bad
to
the
courts,
at
least
that
what
is
going
on
around
the
country,
when
they
do
it
in
regard
to
the
press
and
the
others,
you
pointed
mr.
justice
stewart
in
your
yale
speech,
the
press
is
the
one
private
organization
that
is
carved
out
and
mentioned
specifically
as
entitled
to
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
that
then
they
might
possibly
have
been
held
in
contempt
after
the
--
that
certainly
would
have
been
called
up
on
the
under
canons
of
ethics,
but
that
no
prior
restraint
possibly
have
been
entered.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so.
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
difference
between
prior
restraint
and
a
contempt
after
the
event
has
just
been
made
so
clear
through
all
of
your
opinions.
in
the
prior
restraint,
in
the
first
place
people
tend
to
obey
them,
and
therefore,
it
directly
prohibits
them
doing
of
the
event
and
in
the
second
place,
if
he
is
going
to
be
held
for
a
contempt,
he
can
contest
the
order
itself.
he
can
even
get
a
jury
trial.
he
can
contest
the
contempt
order,
but
in
a
prior
restraint,
you
cannot
do
it.
if
their
prior
restraint
is
entered,
you
then
must
obey
it
under
the
laws
it
now
stands
until
it
is
reversed
on
appeal
and
if
you
go
in
and
try
to
attack
the
order,
the
only
defense
is
that
you
did
not
violate
it,
but
you
cannot
attack
the
order
itself.
so
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
two
situations,
certainly
in
terms
of
impact.
we
say
that
the
assumption
that
someone
who
hears
about
a
case,
even
an
alleged
confession,
the
fact
that
he
cannot
be
impartial
or
if
he
is
partial,
but
he
cannot
be
weeded
out
during
the
voir
dire
is
simply
unsupported.
in
fact,
it
is
directly
refuted
by
statutes
in
nebraska
and
elsewhere
which
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief
which
allow
jurors
to
sit,
even
if
they
have
formed
opinions
of
guilt
from
reading
newspapers
so
long
as
the
judge
is
satisfied
that
the
juror
is
impartial.
the
courts
have
made
it
clear
from
united
states
versus
burr
in
1807,
all
down
through
irvin
v.
dowd
and
reynolds
and
murphy
versus
florida,
that
juror
can
give
an
impartial
verdict
even
if
he
has
some
preconceived
notion
as
to
guilt.
and
if
we
need
any
examples
of
that,
we
certainly
have
them
recently
with
cali,
chapen,
mitchell,
connelly,
lily,
all
of
whom
stand
as
it
seems
to
me
irrefutable
proof
that
even
all
pervasive
publicity
does
not
necessarily
result
in
an
unfair
trial.
we
trust
our
juries
in
so
many
ways.
we
sit
there
and
tell
them,
look,
do
not
listen
to
the
confession
given
by
your
co-defendant.
it
does
not
apply
for
you
and
we
give
them
these
instructions
and
we
trust
them
and
we
expect
them
to
do
their
job
and
yet
nebraska
is
not
willing
to
concede
that
with
proper
voir
dire
and
proper
constructions
that
you
cannot
find
12
people
who
were
going
to
give
this
man
an
impartial
and
fair
verdict.
there
are
ample
ways,
short
of
prior
restraint
to
deal
with
adverse
publicity.
sheppard,
i
counted,
12
of
them
in
sheppard
and
i
do
not
need
to
go
through
them
because
you
are
certainly
aware
of
them,
but
certainly
two
of
them,
change
of
venue
and
continuance,
neither
which
were
given
here
would
obviously
be
what
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
the
fact
is
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
that
there
was
a
request
for
a
change
of
venue
which
was
denied,
there
was
not
a
request
for
a
continuance
and
the
judge
did
not
grant
one
sui
sponte.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct
and
our
response
to
that
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
even
if
you
put
the
surrounding
counties
together,
you
have
got
over
80,000
people,
so
you
certainly
could
be
able
to
find
12
jurors,
but
secondly,
under
the
groppi
case
and
irvin
v.
dowd,
i
think
that
that
provision
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
in
effect
prevented
him
from
getting
12
impartial
jurors.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
would
be
an
order
prohibiting
access.
it
would
be
an
order
in
effect
stopping
them
from
seeking
that
news
and
i
think
it
would
have
many
of
the
same
constitutional
infirmities
that
this
one
had.
it
would
not
be
as
direct,
but
i
think
it
would
be
close
to
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
have
said,
i
do
not
conceive
the
constitutionality
of
that.
i
simply
said
that
is
not
involved
here
and
that
i
recognize
that
sheppard
cited
it
as
one
alternative.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
certainly,
that
a
continuance
would.
i
think
certainly
a
change
of
venue
would.
i
think
when
you
get
to
trial
certainly
sequestration
would.
i
think
that
you
can
even
bring
in
a
foreign
jury
if
necessary
if
it
came
down
to
that
bad
a
case.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
to
you
that
somehow
the
assumption
is,
that
simply
because
you
have
a
danger
that
a
jury
might
hear
some
bad
things,
that
you
are
not
going
to
have
a
trial.
suppose
jack
ruby
had
shot
oswald
on
television
and
every
single
person
in
the
united
states
saw
it,
you
would
not
say
that
ruby
would
not
be
tried,
that
he
could
go
free.
you
would
get
him
a
trial
as
best
as
you
could.
you
would
give
him
a
continuance
and
maybe
for
a
long
time,
you
would
have
the
most
extensive
voir
dire
you
could
possibly
have,
you
would
have
strong
jury
and
instructions,
but
you
would
not
say
go
free.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
that
is
what
sheppard
is
all
about,
that
what
is
sheppard
gives
him.
it
gives
him
a
number
of
ways
that
he
can
protect
himself
short
of
prior
restraint.
it
is
very
instructive
that
in
sheppard,
despite
that
all
of
these
ways
that
were
listed,
the
court
three
times
made
clear
that
it
was
not
talking
about
a
prior
restraint
on
the
press,
and
therefore,
you
do
not
have
this
conflict
that
everyone
seems
to
assume
you
have.
we
have
ways
of
protecting
jurors,
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
most
strongly
that
you
can
protect
them
and
that
you
have
a
constitutional
jury,
as
i
say,
even
if
you
have
people
who
have
read
the
newspaper
and
who
come
to
the
jury
room
first
with
some
kind
of
preconceived
notion.
as
i
say,
they
even
have
a
statute
in
nebraska
which
makes
certain,
that
a
juror
is
not
stricken
just
because
he
has
read
a
newspaper
and
had
heard
some
bad
publicity.
the
judges
have
the
right
to
determine
for
themselves
whether
that
man
is
impartial.
i
want
to
save
a
little
bit
of
time
for
rebuttal
so
can
i
just
simply
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
to
--
at
this
point
in
time,
after
200
years,
when
we
have
let
our
press
print
what
it
is
able
to
get,
to
subject
them
now
to
a
prior
restraint
after
all
of
this
time
is
to
take
away
one
of
the
great
liberties
that
we
have
had.
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
look
very
far
on
the
world.
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
look
very
far
outside
of
this
country
to
understand
the
extraordinary
importance
of
allowing
the
press,
the
only
really
free
press
probably
left
in
the
world
to
publish
what
it
has
gotten
hold
off
so
that
the
public
can
be
contemporaneously
informed
of
all
of
that.
if
one
of
those
watergate
people
had
broken
in
and
had
immediately
confessed
that
he
had
broken
into
democratic
headquarters
at
the
directions
of
the
white
house,
can
we
restrain
for
six
months
from
trial
time
the
fact
that
that
it
happened.
that
is
what
you
are
get
into.
you
are
going
to
get
into
decisions
as
to
well
some
of
these
confessions
maybe
or
ought
to
be
in
the
public
interest
would
get
them
out
and
some
of
we
should
not.
do
not
put
the
courts
into
that
position.
they
are
not
equipped
to
handle
it
and
values
are
too
great.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
jefferson
would
have
enjoyed
that
particularly.[laughter]
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
i
will
take
it
all,
your
honor.
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
would
be
making
my
argument
even
if
prior
restraints
worked.
they
do
not
work
at
least
in
the
sense
of
guaranteeing
a
fair
trial
or
benefiting
the
public.
they
result,
as
you
have
just
pointed
out
mr.
justice
marshall
in
rumor
and
gossip
and
speculation
that
is
often
far
more
dangerous
to
a
defendant
than
factual
reporting
in
a
newspaper.
they
result
in
the
cover-up
of
occasional
corruption
and
abuse
of
power
and
the
pressures
that
elected
judges
sometimes
are
put
under
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
problem
of
course
is
that
is
what
is
actually
going
on
and
that
is
that
you
are
having
a
combination
of
closed
hearings
and
prior
restraints
and
what
we
are
having
more
and
more
now
and
what
is
developing
at
an
accelerating
rate
as
the
fact
that
the
press
is
being
cutoff
entirely.
now,
you
sort
of
assume
that
the
publication
of
a
confession
must
be
a
bad
thing,
it
is
going
to
harm
the
defendant.
in
fact,
people
confess
the
things
all
the
time
that
they
did
not
do
and
the
publication
of
confessions
can
result
in
freeing
the
people.
there
was
an
incident
the
other
day
in
britain
where
a
young
man
was
charged
with
a
crime
and
he
got
on
television
and
said,
i
did
not
do
it
and
the
youngster
who
had
been
at
the
scene
saw
it
and
said
that
man
was
not
there
and
he
told
his
father
they
got
the
police
the
follow
that
off.
now,
the
same
thing
would
have
happened
if
he
had
actually
confessed
on
television.
if
he
said,
i
did
do
it,
and
that
young
boy
said,
i
was
there,
he
did
not
do
it
all,
that
could
have
gotten
that
man
off.
you
cannot
just
assume
that
the
publication
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.[laughter]
i
would
point
out
that
your
honor
that
in
that
case
you
are
talking
about
the
effect
at
trial
and
that
you
reversed,
you
did
not
enter
a
prior
restraint
and
i
think
rideau
is
a
very
good
example
because
you
did
not
order
that
man
to
go
free.
you
sent
him
back
for
a
new
trial
and
you
assumed
that
despite
those
50,000
people
or
however
many
it
was
who
saw
that
television
program,
that
somehow
with
the
sheppard
help,
you
have
got
a
man
who
was
going
to
get
a
fair
trial
the
next
time
around.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
of
course,
we
would
contend
and
the
nebraska
supreme
court
does
not
agree
with
us
that
the
press
is
entitled
to
intervene
here,
that
it
represents
not
only
its
own
rights,
but
the
public's
right.
one
very
strange
aspect
to
this
case
is
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
said,
we
never
should
have
been
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
first
place,
and
that
therefore,
we
could
have
disobeyed
the
county
court
order
with
impunity
even
though
it
was
entered
against
us.
now,
you
got
a
strange
situation.
do
we
have
rights
or
do
we
not?
is
the
public
going
to
be
represented
or
is
it
not?
i
think
what
is
going
to
happen,
if
you
allow
these
things
is
this.
defendants
as
a
matter
of
course
are
going
to
ask
for
a
prior
restraint,
both
to
prevent
themselves
from
being
charged
of
in
effective
assistance
to
the
counsel
and
also
because
it
is
obviously
in
their
client's
interest
not
to
have
any
publicity
about
this.
so
that
is
going
to
become
the
normal
thing.
that
prosecutors,
what
is
their
attitude
going
to
be,
sure,
give
it
to
them.
let
us
do
not
take
a
chance
on
reversal
later,
disagree
to
it
and
suddenly
you
are
sitting
there
with
a
judge,
with
both
of
parties
agreeing
on
something,
pushing
it
toward
it,
you
do
not
have
the
press
present
in
nebraska,
because
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
intervene,
and
so
the
judge
naturally
who
also
does
not
want
to
be
reversed
is
going
to
grant
it.
i
assure
you
no
matter
how
narrow
an
order
you
attempt
to
fashion,
you
are
going
to
see
a
flood
of
litigation
if
this
happens
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
absolutely
not.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
our
right
to
get
information.
we
are
not
saying
that
courts
cannot
keep
some
unknown
information
secret
or
that
everything
has
to
be
made
public.
we
are
not
talking
about
an
access
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i
was
not
arguing
at
that
now.
i
said
i
might
argue
in
the
next
case
that
it
was,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case
they
chose
to
have
a
public
hearing
and
they
nevertheless
refused
to
give
us
the
information
that
was
at
the
public
hearing.
i
think
that
he
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago
that
well,
it
is
just
for
a
short
duration
it
is
just
between
the
preliminary
hearing
and
trial,
it
was
two-and-a-half
months.
you
prevented
this
information
and
that
for
two-and-a-half
months
from
coming
out
and
i
just
do
not
think
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
an
order
you
try
to
fashion,
you
are
going
to
see
the
beginning
of
something
that
is
not
only
a
great
departure
from
our
constitutional
system
as
we
have
known
it,
but
you
are
going
to
see
a
flood
of
litigation
that
is
going
to
result
in
more
and
more
orders
and
i
simply
implore
the
court
not
to
start
down
that
path.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
the
court
is
really
going
to
attempt
to
decide
in
each
case
whether
a
little
bit
of
time
is
too
much
or
too
little,
you
are
really
in
the
trouble.
let
us
say
for
example
that
on
the
morning
of
an
election,
a
congressman
is
indicted
and
confesses
and
an
unconstitutional
order,
constitutional
or
not
is
entered
immediately
against
the
press,
but
it
stays
into
effect
only
until
7
o’clock
that
night.
that
man
is
re-elected,
is
seven
hours
too
little
or
too
late?
are
you
going
to
put
the
courts
into
the
position
of
saying,
well,
in
that
case,
that
seven
hours
was
too
long,
but
in
some
other
case,
maybe
a
week
is
alright
or
a
month
is
alright.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
say
this,
that
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
that
it
is
the
contemporaneous,
in
re
oliver
was
one,
and
i
think
that
there
have
been
several
others,
have
emphasized
that
it
is
the
contemporaneous
publishing
of
news.
the
public's
right
immediately
to
news,
because
you
cannot
judge
the
impact
that
news
is
going
to
have.
in
the
joan
little
case
for
example,
the
fact
that
the
women’s
rights
were
immediately
able,
right
immediately
able
to
generalize,
get
support
for
her,
was
extremely
important
and
in
the
schulingkamp
case,
the
immediate
putting
out
of
the
news
resulted
in
the
whole
juvenile
system
being
redone
and
all
of
that
could
have
been
lost
if
there
had
been
a
delay.
there
was
a
momentum
to
these
things.
there
was
a
momentum
to
news
and
i
think
watergate
of
course
is
the
great
example.
the
fact
that
news
coming
out
now
of
something
is
a
vital
importance
to
this
public
and
as
soon
as
you
start
saying,
no,
let
us
just
keep
it
under
cover
for
a
little
while
you
put
yourself
in
a
very
serious
trouble.
thank
you.
