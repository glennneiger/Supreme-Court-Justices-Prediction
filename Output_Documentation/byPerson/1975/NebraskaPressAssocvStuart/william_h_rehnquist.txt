rehnquist
you
are
going
to
define
that
prior
restraint
somewhere
in
your
argument,
mr.
prettyman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
that
the
prior
--
the
cases
say
that
prior
restraint
comes
here
with
a
heavy
presumption
against
it,
are
at
least
at
their
core,
limited
the
case
is
involving
the
press
rather
than
the
individuals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
sosna
and
weinstein
against
bradford
which
was
a
per
curiam
that
came
down
a
couple
of
months
ago.
we
made
it
rather
clear
that
they
are
capable
of
repetition,
but
evading
review
standard
applied
to
these
particular
litigants
not
just
to
the
issue
in
general?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
an
exception
to
article
3?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
lincoln
county
bar
association
had
done
what
your
hypothetical
calls
for
the
priests,
rabbis
and
pastors
doing
at
a
meeting
at
the
lincoln
country
bar
association?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
is
the
president
of
the
lincoln
county
bar
association
any
better
off,
if
he
is
called
up
on
a
contempt
and
fined
$500,
then
if
he
is
preliminary
enjoined,
cited
for
contempt
when
he
makes
the
speech
and
fined
$500
per
civil
contempt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mosher,
a
minute
ago
you
said
that
frequently
a
pretrial
hearing,
there
would
be
an
offer
of
a
confession?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
typical
in
nebraska
felony
pretrial
that
more
often
than
not
if
there
has
been
a
confession
the
state
will
seek
to
offer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
a
confession
in
fact
offered
at
the
pretrial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
terms
of
the
ordered
tending
to
prove
guilt
of
the
accused
or
just
tending
to
prove
guilt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
an
investigative
reporter,
after
this
order
was
entered,
but
before
simants
trial
came
upon
some
leads
that
led
him
to
think
that
x
rather
than
simants
was
guilty,
would
he
have
been
free
to
publish
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
grand
jury
is
certainly
closed
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
federal
system,
your
grand
jury
is
certainly
closed.
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
press
can
open
up
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
state
of
nebraska
is
constitutionally
obligated
to
open
up
its
preliminary
hearing?
