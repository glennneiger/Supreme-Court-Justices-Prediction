mr.
floyd
abrams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
prettyman
represents
as
he
has
advised
you,
a
large
elements
of
the
nebraska
press.
i
appear
today
on
behalf
of
a
variety
of
publishers,
broadcasters
and
journalists
from
around
the
country
to
join
with
that
press
and
to
urge
upon
you
today
a
ruling
which
would
be
unthinkable
in
any
nation
in
the
world,
except
ours
and
unlikely
in
the
rest.
that
it
is
in
our
view
entirely
consistent
with
american
history
makes
it
no
less
remarkable,
but
simply
points
to
the
remarkable
nature
of
that
history.
for
what
we
would
asked
of
you
is
nothing
less
than
a
renunciation
of
power,
a
conclusion
by
this
court
that
the
judiciary
should
not,
indeed
and
may
not,
tell
the
press
in
advance
what
news
it
may
print,
save
only
in
that
rare
national
security
situation
and
that
rare
national
security
case
adverted
to
by
this
court
in
near
versus
minnesota
in
the
pentagon
papers
case.
and
what
we
urge
upon
you
is
that
renunciation
occurred
over
200
years
ago,
that
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
since
its
formation
and
that
you
should
reaffirm
it
today.
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
earlier
whether
the
label
prior
restraint
was
important
here
and
what
the
relevance
of
it
is
and
i
would
like
to
devote
the
bulk
of
my
remarks
to
that
question.
i
would
like
to
start
historically
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
until
very
recently
it
was
accepted
by
one
and
all
that
whatever
else
could
be
done
to
the
press
with
respect
to
pretrial
publicity,
the
one
thing
that
could
not
be
done
was
any
kind
of
prior
restraint.
20
years
ago
this
month,
if
can
be
personal
for
a
moment,
i
was
on
college
debating
team
we
used
to
talk
about
this
subject
and
debate
this
subject
full-time
for
a
year
and
of
all
the
remedies
that
people
proposed
to
control
what
was
then
thought
sometimes
to
be
an
irresponsible
press,
no
one
even
suggested
in
the
scholarly
works
or
in
our
debates
the
idea
of
prior
restraints.
so
understood
was
it
that
while
there
could
be
some
areas
perhaps
for
contempt
of
court
after
trials
are
over,
that
there
could
be
no
prior
restraints
in
the
area
and
we
were
not
alone.
the
cases
supported
us
as
they
existed
then,
our
briefs
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
amici
curiae
that
i
represent
indicate
that
in
our
effort
to
survey
all
the
cases
in
this
area
in
american
history,
we
come
upon
only
five
prior
to
the
sheppard
case
in
which
there
is
any
reports
at
all
of
any
attempt
to
obtain
a
prior
restraint
against
the
press
and
that
each
of
those
cases,
it
was
easily
and
summarily
reversed,
they
have
of
course
in
many
cases
since
sheppard.
and
while
it
is
true
that
almost
all
of
them
had
been
reversed,
all
but
one,
two
or
three
at
the
most,
it
is
also
true
that
prior
restraints
on
the
press
around
the
country
are
becoming
a
common
place.
within
the
last
year,
new
york
has
had
its
first.
new
jersey
has
had
its
first
and
its
second
and
nebraska
has
had
its
first
and
second
and
third.
but
i
think
it
is
a
fair
question
to
ask
what
is
new
or
what
has
changed
to
lead
to
the
start
of
a
process
by
which
prior
restraints
are
now
being
issued
in
almost
common
place
fashion.
what
i
would
urge
on
you,
it
is
not
that
the
press
has
been
more
irresponsible
by
anyone’s
judgment
within
the
last
few
years
than
the
years
preceding
it.
the
days
of
the
front
page
are
over
if
they
ever
existed
and
even
if
harry
hurst
trial
bore
no
resemblance
to
that
of
sam
sheppard
or
bruno
hauptmann.
it
is
not
the
guilty
defendants
are
walking
free
on
the
streets
because
of
the
press
and
because
there
is
sometimes
perhaps
excessive
pretrial
publicity
and
it
is
not
the
innocent
man,
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
are
in
jail
because
of
irresponsible
press
coverage
of
trials.
and
it
is
not,
i
would
urged
on
you,
that
we
now
have
reason
to
think
that
juries
are
less
trustworthy
than
we
ever
thought
they
were
and
as
mr.
prettyman
indicated,
i
can
hardly
think
of
a
time
in
our
history
when
juries
have
proved
their
metal
in
a
more
strong
basis
than
they
have
it
in
the
last
few
years
nor
is
it
the
studies
of
scholars,
of
judges,
of
lawyers
and
a
journalists
have
concluded
within
the
last
few
years
that
anything
had
changed
and
that
we
should
retreat
from
our
abhorrence
of
prior
restraint
in
this
area.
mr.
floyd
abrams
sure,
your
honor.
i
will
turn
on
that
right
now
after
just
observing
that
there
are
five
separate
studies
in
these
area
by
bar
association
groups
and
the
like
and
each
of
those
conclude
the
prior
restraints
are
constitutionally
impermissible
or
unwise
or
the
both
of
them.
with
respect
to
the
post
trial
study,
i
would
have
a
few
comments
to
make.
first,
it
is
really
devoid,
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
prettyman
in
his
brief
urged
upon
you
that
if
you
care
to
take
account
of
that
post
trial
study
that
that
petitioners
before
you
should
be
permitted
to
put
in
a
post-trial
study
of
their
own
which
is
a
poll
taken
by
the
north
platte
newspaper
of
the
jurors
as
to
what
they
meant
when
the
judge
asked
them
those
questions
after
the
trial.
i
suspect
you
will
not
be
interested
in
that
poll,
but
i
think
it
is
first
to
rather
unreliable
study.
i
think
the
phraseology
of
the
study
is
to
say
the
least,
slanted,
and
i
am
struck
by
the
fact
as
mr.
prettyman’s
brief
argues
to
you
that
one
would
believe
jurors
at
the
post
trial
moment
when
they
are
asked
that
question
and
not
believe
them
when
they
are
asked
if
they
can
give
a
fair
trial
in
voir
dire
time
prior
to
a
trial
beginning.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
good
part
of
what
is
involved
in
this
in
this
case
involves
just
that
question
of
whether
we
can
trust
jurors
or
not.
as
i
have
urged
upon
you,
we
think
there
is
no
time
in
our
history
when
jurors
have
better
indicated
their
ability
to
decide
cases
and
to
decide
them
without
reliance
on
outside
factors
which
might
have
been
indicated
and
which
others
might
have
thought
might
have
affected
them.
now,
we
have
urged
on
you
the
sheppard
case.
we
have
urged
it
again
and
again
and
i
just
for
you
to
decide
whether
our
interpretation
of
sheppard
and
our
reading
of
sheppard
is
correct.
it
is
supported,
we
urge
on
you
by
higher
courts
in
new
york
and
california
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
and
i
can
think
one
other
reason
apart
from
what
i
believe
to
be
a
misinterpretation
by
many
lower
courts
of
the
sheppard
decision,
for
the
amount
of
gag
orders
or
restrictive
orders
that
had
been
issuing
in
recent
years.
i
detect
for
what
it
maybe
worth
to
you,
a
profound
and
growing
sense
of
judicial
concern
that
what
is
sometimes
is
viewed
to
be
your
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
press
and
its
coverage
of
courts
and
of
other
matters.
i
have
been
confronted
when
i
have
argued
before
other
courts
than
this
with
a
number
of
questions
relating
to
just
those
matters,
relating
essentially
to
matters
of
responsibility
and
i
could
do
no
more
with
respect
to
that
and
to
urge
on
you
the
language
in
the
cbs
case
of
the
chief
justice
for
the
majority
of
the
court
that
the
risks
of
abuse
of
the
first
amendment
are
well
known
to
the
framers
who
accepted
the
reality
that
risks
of
those
of
abuse
or
evils
of
which
there
was
no
acceptable
remedy
other
than
the
spirit
of
moderation
and
a
sense
of
responsibility
and
civility
on
the
part
of
those
who
exercise
the
guaranteed
freedoms
of
expression.
i
wish
to
be
clear.
we
maybe
back
someday,
i
suspect,
some
of
us
will,
representing
clients
or
some
of
our
brethren
representing
clients
will
be
back
urging
on
you
the
proposition
that
a
power
to
hold
the
press
in
contempt
is
very
narrow,
that
the
power
to
punish
the
press
for
what
it
prints
is
narrower
still.
but
historically,
the
power
to
ban
the
press
in
advance,
from
deciding
what
to
print,
is
narrowest
still
and
that
is
this
case.
mr.
floyd
abrams
yes.
mr.
floyd
abrams
justice
stewart,
what
i
meant
to
convey
in
nebraska,
i
have
lost
in
conveying,
but
that
i
think
it
is
attributable
to
two
separate
things.
one
is
in
this
reading
as
we
view
it
of
the
sheppard
case
by
lower
courts
around
the
country
and
the
second
is
what
i
described
as
what
i
view
at
least
or
what
i
see
at
least,
as
the
continuing
sense
of
judicial
concern
of
the
nature
of
the
reporting
which
occurs
with
respect
to
the
judicial
process.
those
are
the
two
things
that
i
think
it
is.
it
is
also
i
think,
and
we
have
urged
upon
you
in
our
amici
brief
on
this
reading
of
those
cases
of
this
court
which
deal
with
the
heavy
burden
on
prior
restraints.
i
did
not
understand
the
concept
of
heavy
burden
on
prior
restraints
to
be
an
invitation
to
enter
prior
restraints
when
on
some
basis
or
another
it
was
thought
useful
to
do
so.
we
believe
that
the
nature
of
the
prior
restraint
idea
is
set
forth
in
the
southeastern
productions
case
of
justice
blackmun
and
that
you
must
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
they
can
be
prior
restraints
at
all,
whether
historically,
there
has
been
a
category
established
here
of
prior
restraints
which
are
acceptable
in
this
area
and
an
exception
to
what
the
court
in
southeastern
production
refer
to
as
the
prohibition
against
prior
restraints.
mr.
floyd
abrams
i
think
you
have
to
live
with
it,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
one
of
the
ways
that
you
live
with
it
is
by
giving
jury
instructions
by
appropriate
voir
dire,
by
all
the
sheppard
methods,
but
to
take
your
questions
at
its
narrowest,
yes
it
is
our
view
that
there
are
such
things
as
we
do
have
to
live
with
if
it
had
finally
comes
to
that,
be
it
confessions
or
something
else.
i
would
close
with
this
observation.
we
well
appreciate
that
there
are
cases
which
this
court
must
sit
as
a
drawer
of
very
hard
to
draw
lines
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
on
a
case-to-case
basis
and
there
are
of
course
areas
in
which
it
may
properly
be
set
as
justice
holmes
did,
“that
the
power
to
tax
is
not
the
power
to
destroy
while
this
court
sits.”
we
believe
the
power
to
lay
prior
restraints
on
news
reporting
is
the
power
to
destroy
and
we
urge
this
court
not
to
permit
the
birth
or
growth
of
such
a
rule
of
law.
