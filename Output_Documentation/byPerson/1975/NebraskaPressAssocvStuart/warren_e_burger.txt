chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-817,
nebraska
press
association
and
others
against
stuart.
mr.
prettyman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman,
could
that
have
been
in
a
closed
hearing
with
the
consent
of
the
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
mr.
prettyman
that
to
entertain
the
arguments
you
advance,
we
must
explore
all
of
the
alternatives
to
what
you
characterize
as
prior
restraint?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
take
the
same
view
of
an
order
directed
at
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel,
that
they
would
be
held
in
contempt
if
they
discussed
the
case
publicly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
extreme
examples
that
to
a
degree
the
rules
of
evidence
and
the
rules
of
procedure
are
a
restraint
on
the
lawyers
who
are
appearing
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
so
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
sound
equipment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hypothetically,
i
emphasize
hypothetically
possible
that
the
case
might
come
here
and
we
reversed
with
the
sheppard
case
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
after
we
have
decided
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
after
we
have
decided
this
case,
suppose
we
decided
in
your
favor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
his
case
comes
up
here,
hypothetically
and
theoretically,
we
could
reverse
on
the
ground
that
there
were
excessive
publicity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
trial
judge
handed
an
order,
a
protective
order
along
the
lines
you
intimated
as
an
alternative,
namely,
a
written
directive
or
directive
on
the
record
to
the
prosecutor
that
he
is
not
to
talk
to
anyone,
specifically
including
media,
to
the
defense
counsel,
the
same,
to
the
witnesses,
would
the
media
representatives
be
in
violation
if
they
importune
these
people
who
violate
the
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
an
order
appropriately
be
entered
that
they
should
importuned
not
to
violate
the
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
alright
to
put
the
order
on
the
attorneys?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
suggest
whether
the
alternatives
that
you
think
would
survive
constitutional
scrutiny?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
the
issue
really
in
that
mr.
prettyman
or
is
the
issue
that
a
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right,
if
you
protect
it
from
the
influences
that
will
impair
a
fair
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
abrams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
abrams
neither
you
so
far
nor
mr.
prettyman
have
refereed
to
the
trial
judge's
post-trial
inquiry
of
the
jury.
i
hope
that
some
point
before
you
sit
down,
you
will
leave
us
your
comments
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
abrams.
mr.
mosher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mosher,
suppose
that
after
the
restrictive
order,
challenged
as
prior
restraint
had
gone
into
effect,
did
the
local
television
station
decided
to
re-run
the
dramatization
of
the
texas
sniper
killings
and
both
the
defense
and
the
prosecution
came
to
the
court
and
said
this
is
going
to
stir
up
all
kinds
of
passion
and
prejudice
and
impede
a
fair
trial
and
we
want
a
restraining
order
to
restrain
the
showing
of
the
dramatization
of
the
texas
city
affair.
do
you
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
matter
for
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
a
tendency
to
provoke
passions
and
prejudices?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
an
order
restricting
them
from
making
false
statements
or
making
any
statements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
larson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
larson.
mr.
prettyman,
you
have
i
think,
eight
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
if
the
press
are
permitted
to
be
present
and
have
access
to
the
entire
record,
they
have
a
rather
hard
time
covering
it
up.
it
could
be
delayed
reporting,
but
could
not
cover
it
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman,
your
argument
on
the
matter
why
is
it
essential
that
it
be
published
tomorrow
morning
as
distinguished
from
a
later
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
that
there
is
no
barrier
whatever
to
the
subsequent
publication?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
