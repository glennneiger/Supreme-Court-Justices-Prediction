were
the
statute
requiring
the
commission
to
be
sure
that
all
of
the
test
are
job
related
tests
unless
there
is
an
attack
upon
that
--
can
not
one
assume
that
the
commissioners
have
followed
the
law,
does
not
help
up
defendants
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
evans
could
i
ask
you
the
same
question,
i
asked
your
opponent,
just
precisely
what
is
the
burden?
do
you
contend
that
they
have
failed
to
prove
that
the
test
establishes
verbal
ability
or
that
verbal
ability
is
not
a
component
of
the
policeman’s
job?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
question
that
it
is
does
establish
verbal
ability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
assume
they
were
not
for
a
moment;
i
just
like
to
think
through
a
little
bit
and
assume
that
there
is
an
expert
who
testifies
without
contradiction
that
this
test
does
establish
verbal
ability.
what
would
your
position
be
with
regard
to
the
question
whether
that
is
a
job
related
characteristic
of
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
or
not,
reading
ability
is
a
component
of
a
successful
performance
of
the
policeman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
we
put
the
training
school
completely
aside,
we
would
just
take
court
of
appeals
problem
which
is
that
we
focused
on
the
training
school
instead
of
the
element
job,
but
is
there
--
do
you
take
issue
with
the
suggestion
in
judge
rob’s
dissent
that
one
should
know
that
a
police
officer
must
know
how
to
read
with
sufficient
skill
to
handle
search
warrants
or
things
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
trying
to
debate
the
issue,
your
position
is
that
there
must
be
proof
in
the
record
that
reading
ability
has
some
relationship
to
the
job
of
a
police
officer
before
a
court
could
accept
that
conclusion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
if
a
test
established
the
qualification
for
one
of
several
traits
that
would
be
required
for
a
job.
it
could
nevertheless
be
job
related?
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
it
has
a
different
point.
this
is
not
like
a
test,
it
says,
“sure
you
got
to
be
able
to
read
but
you
do
not
necessary
have
to
able
to
reach
shakespeare.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
we
tell
by
looking
at
this
test
whether
or
not
it
measures
the
ability
to
shakespeare,
the
ability
to
read
search
warrants.
