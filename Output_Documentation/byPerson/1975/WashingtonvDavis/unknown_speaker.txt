mr.
sutton
could
i
ask
just
one
question,
if
you
assume
that
the
burden
shifted
by
showing
the
racial
impact,
what
do
you
understand
that
the
defendant's
burden
is?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
answering
my
question,
assume
that
there
is
a
shift
in
the
burden.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
understand
that
the
defendants
must
prove
in
order
to
shoulder
their
burden?
unknown
speaker
then
that
you
have
met
that
burden
if
you
prove
that
the
test
establishes
verbal
ability?
unknown
speaker
so
your
position
is
that
the
record
shows
that
the
verbal
ability
is
established
and
verbal
ability
is
a
component
of
job
performance.
unknown
speaker
is
it
also
needed
in
order
to
be
an
adequate
police
officer?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
if
the
record
establishes
that
this
test
is
a
measure
of
verbal
ability,
you
win.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
independently
you
should
prevail
because
in
terms
of
actual
hiring,
your
recruitment
program
produces
a
police
force
that
racially
mares
the
community
in
terms
of
division
between
blacks
and
whites?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
twice
as
many
blacks
as
white
pass
the
test,
but
you
nevertheless
hired
in
proportion
to
the
racial
composition
of
the
community.
do
you
think
that
--
unknown
speaker
well.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
quarter
system
violates
section
vii,
title
vii.
unknown
speaker
either
way?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
title
vii
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
case
would
have
been
tried
differently
if
the
rules
that
are
now
applicable
had
been
enforced
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
rules
are
the
same
now
as
they
were
then?
unknown
speaker
even
though
title
vii
was
not.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
the
question
because
your
opposition
does
not
stress
it.
is
it
not
true
that
of
those
passing
the
test,
a
larger
percentage
of
negroes
was
hired
than
of
whites,
of
those
passing
the
test?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
the
percentage
of
those
passers.
unknown
speaker
well
my
question
is
taking
out
just
those
who
passed
and
the
hires
from
that
pool
of
passers,
is
not
the
percentage
of
negroes
hired
greater
than
the
percentage
of
passers.
unknown
speaker
indeed.
unknown
speaker
and
your
opponent
makes
no
mention
of
this.
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
his
brief
anywhere,
but
he
concentrates
entirely
on
those
taking
the
test,
not
on
those
who
pass
it.

what
prevent
the
psychologist
changing
their
mind
tomorrow?
unknown
speaker
they
think
it
is
unknown
to
do?
unknown
speaker
mr.
evans,
you
said
there
were
two
things
missing
from
the
petitioner’s
case
that
you
stated
the
second
if
--
unknown
speaker
so
as
questions,
i
do
not
see,
how
you
can
even
mark
him.
unknown
speaker
for
example
on
page
24
(a).
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
one
other
question,
you
are
here
as
attorney
for
the
civil
service
commission
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
identifying
some
shortcomings
in
the
defendants
proof.
are
you
in
effect
asking
for
remand
so
that
your
client
could
put
in
the
evidence
that
you
say
is
missing?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
that
evidence
is
available?
unknown
speaker
the
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
you
are
here
and
on
behalf
of
that
litigant,
you
want
to
remand
it?
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
made
that
inquiry
yet
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
made
that
inquiry
yet?
unknown
speaker
in
the
abstract
here
–
unknown
speaker
you
are
sort
of
arguing
in
the
abstract
here.
unknown
speaker
they
also
moved
for
summary
judgment,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
brief
witnesses
in
your
own
case?
unknown
speaker
just
as
someone
else
should
remedy
them.
unknown
speaker
those
are
the
petitions.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
we
never
get
to
any
of
this
stuff,
unless
we
agree
with
you
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
plaintiffs
proved
an
adverse
racial
impact.
we
never
get
to
any
of
it.
unknown
speaker
you
are
conceding
that
you
lost
that
part
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
you
do
here
represent
the
civil
service
commission
and
only
the
civil
service
commission?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
we
assume
that
we
must
face
the
fact
that
court
of
appeal
did
go
on
a
constitutional
ground.
unknown
speaker
and
that,
is
it
your
impression
of
the
equal
protection
standard
that
a
showing
of
unequal
racial
impact
is
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause?
unknown
speaker
is
that
under
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
did
this
show
some
rational
explanation
is
enough
under
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
it
is
different.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sobol,
i
wonder
perhaps
we
are
not
phrasing
the
constitutional
issue
incorrectly.
you
suggested
the
classification
is
between
those
who
pass
and
those
who
fail.
i
wonder
if
you
are
not
really
arguing
that
if
one
looks
closely
behind
what
has
happened,
that
we
really
have
a
racial
classification
and
that
is
your
contention,
that
there
is
--
the
way
the
test
works,
it
divides
the
groups
on
account
of
race
rather
than
simply
on
account
of
pass/fail
and
if
that
is
the
question,
then
our
issue
is
whether
it
is
a
racial
classification
which
in
turn
would
decide
what
kind
of
a
burden
was
involved.
i
am
just
wondering
if
you
have
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
no,
do
you
mean
the
test
--
evaluate
the
test
by
who
passes
it
and
who
fails,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
wanted
to
ask
anyway
whether
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows
any
correlation
between
the
performance
on
the
test
and
the
prior
performance
in
high
school,
are
high
school
grades
available
for
example?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
correlation
between
performance
on
the
test
and
attendance
at
particular
high
schools.
unknown
speaker
and
may
there
well
be
a
difference
between
the
training
one
received
say
at
central
high
school
in
washington
and
that
one
might
receive
in
wise
county
of
virginia
up
in
the
mountains?
unknown
speaker
what
should
we
do
if
we
decided
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
its
constitutional
ground?
unknown
speaker
that
is
wrong
on
1981.
unknown
speaker
and
the
constitutional
ground
because
title
vii
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
considered
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis,
why
would
it
ever
reach
the
constitutional
ground?
why
would
it
not
deal
with
the
statutory
ground
and
the
court’s
believed?
unknown
speaker
you
got
to
refer
--
unknown
speaker
at
the
end
of
footnote
2.
unknown
speaker
that
was
congress'
fifth
amendment
title
vii,
which
charges
a
racial
discrimination
between
federal
employment
and
the
appellants
questionably
are
entitled
to
the
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
is
only
that
he
also
decided
on
the
constitutional
ground.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
just
a
purely
title
vii
case
as
it
comes
to
us
in
the
court
of
appeals
without
any
constitutional
overtone?
unknown
speaker
is
your
next
case,
the
bar
examination
cases?
unknown
speaker
is
your
next
case
to
bar
examination?
unknown
speaker
well
talking
about
the
possibility
of
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunctive
relief?
unknown
speaker
the
problem
is
we
live
in
an
age
when
if
one
can
read,
if
one
can
believe
what
he
cures
and
reads
that
to
many
high
school
graduate
do
not
have
the
equivalent
of
a
high
school
education.
