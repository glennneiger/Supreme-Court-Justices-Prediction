mr.
david
p.
sutton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
its
threshold
this
case
presents
two
highly
important
societal
values.
the
right
of
a
community
to
be
free
from
discrimination
in
public
employment
and
to
the
right
of
a
community
to
a
competent
police
force
is
our
position
that
both
of
these
values
maybe
rationally
upheld
in
this
case,
such
a
failure
and
necessarily
leads
to
the
statement
of
the
basic
issues
involved.
at
the
time
the
certiorari
petition
came
before
this
court,
the
issue
were
two
in
numbers.
first,
whether
the
metropolitan
police
departments
test
21,
its
entrance
test
has
an
adverse
racial
impact
and
secondly
whether
that
test
is
rationally
related
to
ones
ability
to
be
trained
as
the
policeman.
later
in
proceeding
before
this
court,
the
federal
government
has
injected
a
third
issue
into
the
case
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
court
may
adequately
deal
with
the
case
on
existing
summary
judgment
record
which
came
to
it
as
opposed
to
remanding
the
case
to
the
district
court,
so
that
we
may
begin
all
over
again.
i
would
like
to
take
up
these
issues
individually.
in
essence
our
position
is
that
test
21
does
not
have
irrationally
disproportion
of
impact,
in
any
event
as
job
related
and
that
a
remand
as
suggested
by
federal
government
which
served
no
useful
purpose
and
would
indeed
subvert
the
interest
of
judicial
economy.
i
will
turn
briefly
to
the
impact
issue.
we
do
not
ask
this
court
to
single
out
any
one
factor
in
dealing
with
the
impact
issue.
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
four
factors
or
four
equal
employment
badges
of
credibility
which
conclusively
negate
an
adverse
impact
and
that
these
factors
may
find
support
in
this
courts
decisions.
first,
vigorous
minority
recruitment,
there
is
no
question
that
since
chief
wilson
took
office
in
1969
the
department
has
vigorously,
aggressively,
unwaveringly,
sought
to
recruit
blacks
into
the
department
and
has
succeeded.
let
us
talk
about
the
applicant
pool.
in
this
courts
most
recent
decision
on
the
subject
albermarle
paper
company
versus
moody,
this
court
spoke
in
terms
of
a
test
which
has
a
racial
pattern
significantly
different
from
that
of
the
pool
of
applicants,
for
the
most
two
recent
years
for
which
statistics
are
available,
1970
and
1971,
53%
of
all
the
applicants
were
black
and
43%
of
all
the
new
policeman
were
black.
we
have
a
10%
under
representation,
we
submit
this
does
not
indicate
an
adverse
impact,
but
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
stop
here;
we
have
two
more
badges
of
credibility.
first,
we
may
fairly
compare
those
in
the
20
to
29
h
category
hired
by
the
department,
the
eligibles,
44%
between
1969
and
the
time
the
court
rules.
now
for
some
reason
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no,
of
44%
of
all
the
applicants
were
black.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
54%,
but
this
must
be
compared
your
honor;
mr.
justice
stewart
with
the
blacks
and
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
which
is
considerably
lesser
than
the
50
mile
radius
from
which
the
department
recruits.
now
the
smsa
or
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area,
figures
applicable
to
this
age
group.
in
1970,
at
the
time
this
case
was
spending
was
24%.
so
we
double
that,
but
again
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
stop
there,
i
would
like
to
borrow
on
this
court's
very
language
in
griggs
and
this,
i
think
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
impact
tests.
in
griggs
this
court
emphasized,
that
the
question
is
not
one
of
intentional
discrimination,
it
is
a
question
of
a
practice
which
is
neutralized
space,
but
which
has
the
effect
of
locking
in
or
freezing
a
racially
unacceptable
status
quo.
for
that
reason
this
court
said
in
griggs
that
under
the
act,
civil
right
act,
practices,
procedure
or
a
tests
neutral
on
their
face
and
even
neutral
in
terms
of
intent
cannot
be
maintained,
if
they
operate
to
freeze
the
status
quo
of
prior
discriminatory
employment
practices.
how
about
a
test
that
does
the
opposite?
the
record
does
show
in
this
case
that
in
1965,
which
co-incidentally
was
the
effective
date
of
the
civil
rights
act
title
vii,
the
department's
black
component
was
17%.
the
record
showed
that
that
components
spiral
overwhelmingly.
the
records
shows
for
example,
that
between
1967
and
1970,
the
black
component
of
the
department
increased
228%,
the
white
component
47%.
now
recent
statistics
which
in
the
report
prepared
by
the
district
humans
right
office
which
will
soon
be
available,
is
on
the
mayor's
desk
right
now
shows
that
presently
the
department's
black
component
is
41.2%.
now
this
is
the
officer
of
status
quo
freezing,
instead
of
lacking
in
a
discriminatory
practice
of
yesteryear,
this
dissipates
anything
that
could
arguably
exist
between
what
went
on
in
the
past
and
what
went
on
now.
we
do
not
ask
the
court
to
consider
anyone
of
this
practice,
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
totality
of
the
practice
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
does,
does
the
court
will
find
that
no
adverse
impact
exists.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
job
relatedness
and
i
would
like
to
spend
as
much
time
as
i
can
on
the
late
contention
of
the
federal
respondents,
that
this
court
cannot
deal
with
the
matter
on
the
existing
record
for
what
of
available
psychological
data,
but
first
of
all,
again
we
begin
with
the
albermarle
pronouncement;
this
court
in
albermarle
said
that
in
essence
that
will
continue
to
consider
two
factors
on
job
relatedness.
the
job
relatedness
is
a
contextual
matter,
must
be
considered
in
the
context
of
the
employers
operation
first
of
all
and
secondly
in
the
history
of
the
testing
program.
well,
let
us
take
the
employers
operation
which
necessarily
requires
that
we
focus
on
a
policeman’s
job.
now,
what
kind
of
a
job
we
are
talking
about?
the
policeman
of
today
is
not
the
village
constable
of
yesteryear.
he
lives
and
performs
in
an
age
of
evolving
legal
concepts.
he
must
necessarily
have
some
kind
of
knowledge
or
familiarity
with
the
laws
of
arrest,
stop
and
frisk,
search
and
seizure,
and
this
is
the
age
of
miranda
v.
arizona
and
carey
v.
ohio,
then
too
the
policemen
must
have
some
kind
of
basic
understanding
of
the
component
or
constituent
elements
of
the
various
criminal
offenses
with
which
he
will
be
concerned
when
he
works
as
this.
he
must
be
reasonably
skilled
in
a
report
writing,
in
the
language
of
the
dissenting
judge
and
the
court
below,
he
must
be
articulate.
in
the
language
of
this
court,
in
albermarle,
he
must
have
job
specific
ability.
the
department's
training
curriculum
which
is
before
of
this
court
discusses
all
this
areas
as
matter
which
recruits
shall
be
exposed
to
arrest,
search,
seizure
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
and
for
that
reason
we
respectfully
submit,it
is
designed
to
impart
the
kind
of
job
specific
ability
that
this
court
referred
to
in
the
albermarle
case.
obviously,
want
these
verbal
ability
to
understand
these
materials,
to
understand
the
law
of
arrest,
search
and
seizure.
it
is
undisputed,
that
test
21
is
a
straight
forward
test
of
verbal
ability.
the
test
requires
a
job
specific
ability
that
is
training
related
on
its
face
as
judge
rob
so
held,
we
could
stop
there
if
we
wanted
to
but
we
do
not
have
to
because
we
have
considerably
more
than
that.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
second
contextual
criterion.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
they
said
that
in
essence
as
we
say
that
it
is
does
not
predict
trainability,
they
took
question
where
issue
with
is
cut
off
score
of
40
and
they
stressed
the
fact
that
since
nobody
fail
a
recruit
school,
we
could
not
use
it.
i
think
that
this
comes
in
rather
nicely
with
the
history
of
the
testing
program
and
that
will
tell
us
an
lawful
lot
with
respect
to
the
appendix
or—.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
is
not
gear
the
policeman
mr.
justice
marshall.
but,
particularly
suited
to
the
policeman
because
that
it
is
geared
to
the
high
school
graduate
and
respondent
concede
that
the
high
school
education
is
sufficient,
is
required
to
be
a
policeman,
authoritative
study
throughout
the
country
including
the
president's
crime
commission,
take
a
similar
position.
while
it
is
generally
geared
to
any
job
which
in
turn
requires
the
high
school
education.
we
respectfully
submit
as
peculiarly
suitable
to
this
job,
when
study
galore
insists
upon
a
policeman
having
not
high
a
school
education
but
more,
some
people
would
say
college
degree,
we
do
not
to
go
that
far
on
this
case.
in
terms
of
history
these
terms
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
that
is
correct,
we
would
welcome
holding
a
job
relatedness
as
we
can
understand
why
the
court
might
not
want
to
make
one
and
if
there
is
a
slight
impact
and
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
submit
that
it
is.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
yes,
your
honor,
could
i
go
to
history,
this
test
with
its
cut
off
score
40
correct
out
of
80
which
the
50%
passing
score
really,
has
been
the
existence
for
over
20
years.
it
was
issued
then
on
the
effective
date
of
the
1965
civil
rights
act
like
the
test
in
griggs
versus
duke
power
company
in
which
there
was
almost
intentional
discrimination.
the
study
was
conducted
in
the
1967,
it
was
not
conducted
as
a
last
ditch
effort
to
avoid
back
pay
when
the
specter
of
back
pay
was
raised
on
the
evil
trial
as
was
the
study
conducted
in
albermarle
paper
company
and
which
the
federal
respondent
seem
to
clink
as
the
controlling
precedent
which
they
seem
the
fact
as
the
controlling
precedent
in
the
context
of
a
remand.
unlike
the
study
in
albermarle,
it
did
not
involve
whites
only.
it
involved
members
of
both
the
races,
the
record
shows
that
there
is
an
across
the
board
relationship
for
both
races
between
test
scores
and
recruit
school
averages.
enhance
and
predict
trainability.
it
was
not
based
on
subjective
supervisory
ratings
as
was
the
situation
in
albermarle,
it
was
based
upon
objective
criteria,
it
was
based
upon
test
to
test
co-relation
which
even
the
american
physiological
association
recognizes
as
acceptable.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor,
the
record
indicates
that
everybody
does
ultimately
pass
recruit
school
but
everybody
does
not
pass
recruit
school
tests.
at
page
102
of
the
appendix,
futransky
shows
that
he
considered
the
fact
that
some
failed.
at
pages
181
and
182
of
the
appendix,
it
is
pointed
out
that
futransky
study
was
based
upon
the
first
taking
of
the
test,
if
we
were
to
consider
this
as
an
adverse
factor,
it
would
give
the
department
a
disincentive
for
working
with
people
who
otherwise
would
not
make
recruit
school.
it
is
a
neutral
factor
at
best,
i
mean
at
worst.
at
best
a
positive
factor
which
shows
an
employer
sensitivity
to
members
of
both
races.
but
the
point
that
i
really
want
to
make
is
the
federal
respondents
contention
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
because
i
think
it
involves
the
matter,
that
strikes
at
the
very
high
and
what
this
type
of
litigation
is
all
about?
involves
an
important
policy
question
considering
the
extent
to
which
this
court
and
other
federal
courts,
should
rely
upon
psychological
data
in
decision
making.
what
they
say
first
of
all,
is
that
whether
or
not
there
is
a
relationship
or
an
access
between
the
content
of
the
recruit
school
curriculum
and
the
policeman’s
job
as
a
matter
which
should
be
decided
by
psychologist
until
such
time
as
the
psychological
record
has
built
up,
this
court
is
incapable
of
dealing
with
the
matter
on
existing
records.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
contention
is
baseless
and
will
lead
to
all
kinds
of
difficulty.
this
court
has
imposed
many
of
the
requirements
for
policeman’s
job
throughout
the
years.
this
court
has
written
a
description
for
the
job
in
a
narrow
speaking.
this
court’s
expertise
on
the
question
of
whether
a
recruit
school
curriculum
is
related
to
a
police
officers
job,
we
submit
is
entitled
to
more
credence
and
a
ton
of
psychological
studies.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
rational
basis
your
honor,
and
i
think
question
in
narrower
stand
to
review,
this
court
can
view
the
recruit
school
curriculum
applied
to
what
it
knows
about
a
policeman’s
job
and
say
that
the
rational
relationship,
that
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
connection
between
what
a
recruit
learns
at
recruit
school
and
what
he
does
on
the
job
is
legal
one,
not
a
psychological
one.
i
think
the
same
would
hold
true
of
a
bar
examination
for
example.
if
this
court
had
before
the
bar
examination
and
the
question
was
whether
because
less
blacks
pass
it,
it
is
related
to
the
practice
of
law,
i
do
no
think
that
this
court
would
want
to
remand
it.
i
would
hope
or
submit
that
this
court
would
not
want
to
remand
the
case
like
that.
the
psychological
proof
as
to
whether
the
bar
exam
relates
to
the
job
of
the
lawyer.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
but,
counsel
would
have
the
district
court
or
federal
counsel
put
the
district
to
its
psychological
proof,
to
have
a
balancing
of
the
evidence
test,
to
have
psychologists
take
the
stand
and
testify
as
to
what
a
policeman’s
job
is
like.
we
submit
there
is
no
need
for
that.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
that
your
honor,
i
do
not
feel
that
in
this
area,
we
need
to
have
questions
of
fact
in
the
sense,
so
we
have
to
put
an
evidence
on
both
sides
of
the
scale
and
build
up
a
massive
record.
i
think
it
would
subvert
the
interest
of
judicial
economy.
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
jobs
where
we
could
just
introduce,
job
descriptions
and
training
curriculum
and
provide
a
sufficient
basis
for
summary
judgment
ruling.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
that
is
exactly
my
position
your
honor
and
i
only
add
to
that.
that
if
we
can
take
a
contrary
position
with
respect
to
policeman,
how
far
are
we
going
to
carry
this?
we
are
going
to
apply
it
claims
examiners
who
deal
with
the
welfare
regulations,
training
program
and
the
context
of
what
these
regulations
are
about.
administrative
law
judges,
bar
examinations,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
at
the
same
time,
we
are
not
suggesting
at
this
court
lay
down
a
rule
for
all
seasons.
we
ask
this
court
for
a
very
narrow
rule.
at
least
insofar
as
this
job
is
concerned,
the
stand
of
review
should
be
narrow.
there
are
many
private
jobs
that
this
court
does
not
have
much
knowledge
of.
because
of
the
complex
society
in
which
we
live
and
we
submit
that
the
employer
should
be
put
to
a
psychological
proof.
he
should
call
in
psychological
testimony,
jobs
involving
textile
mills
if
you
will.
jobs
involving
those
such
as
job,
such
as
those
involved
in
the
albermarle
paper
company.
i
think
that,
that
question
can
be
fleshed
out
with
the
passage
of
time,
when
we
take
this
job
as
it
comes
and
i
wish
to
emphasis,
there
are
many
jobs
where
the
employer
should
be
put
to
a
psychological
proof.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor,
we
have
the
curriculum
before
the
court
and
the
curriculum
shows
what
is
taught
there
and
this
court
knows
that
what
is
taught
there
ties
in
with
what
the
policeman
does
because
this
court
constantly
reviews
matters.
maybe
this
court
does
not
know
every
thing
that
goes.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
perhaps
you
have
been
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
not
here,
it
is
true.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
your
honor
it
was
not,
but
the
district
court
made
title
vii
applicable
by
analogy
and
equal
protection
kind
of
way
and
we
think
that
is
fair.
we
think
that
the
public
employer
should
certainly
maybe
not
minutely
meet
all
the
title
vii
standards,
but
should
substantially
comply
with
title
vii
even
though
the
district
was
not
included
within
title
vii
at
that
time.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
do
not
think
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
let
us
say
they
are
pretty
close
though
and
i
think
that
the
question
is
probably
academic
because
we
have
gone
further
in
this
case
and
any
title
vii
private
employee
would
go,
i
realize
that
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
because
we
think
--
no
your
honor,
because
quite
frankly
we
think
that
the
substance
of
title
vii
has
been
complied
with.
now
the
civil
service
commission
has
issued
regulations
pursuant
to
title
vii,
we
are
now
involved
in
title
vii,
now
it
does
apply,
so
for
all
practical
purposes
in
the
future
we
are
involved,
that
would
make
this
distinction,
the
connection
with
the
guidelines,
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
albermarle
that
the
guidelines
are
not
regulations
promulgated
pursuant
to
administrative
procedure
act
and
hence
they
are
different
in
that
respect
and
these
regulations
that
the
civil
service
commission
has
promulgated
were
and
they
should
be
entitled
to
more
weight
than
the
guidelines
and
i
specifically
validate
this
test.
the
only
other
point
i
would
make
before
sitting
down
is
that
the
federal
respondents
make
a
second
point
that
unless
this
court
has
recruit
school
examinations
that
were
given
in
1963
and
that
is
when
they
were
given
or
evidentiary
explication
of
the
context
of
those
examinations,
there
are
no
criterion
measurements,
and
hence
the
court
is
incapable
of
dealing
with
the
case
on
the
existing
record
before
it.
we
make
no
bounds
about
it,
we
do
not
have
those
examination,
they
are
not
available,
nor
can
the
contents
of
the
examination
be
reconstructed.
but
this
point
was
never
raised
in
the
district
court;
this
point
was
not
raised
by
the
individual
respondents
or
by
the
federal
respondent.
we
submit
that
a
presumption
of
regularity
should
apply,
particularly
since
we
know
from
the
dc
crime
commissions
report
that
the
professors
or
instructors
that
prepare
the
examinations
were
generally
competent,
they
did
a
good
job,
there
was
nothing
suspicious
or
unusual
in
this
case
which
suggest
that
the
examinations
were
not
calculated
to
assist
mastery
of
what
was
taught
and
we
think
that
if
it
is
by
date,
the
court
should
accept
the
federal
respondent's
contention
and
penalize
the
employer
when
those
who
challenged
the
test,
could
care
less
about
the
exams.
they
will
content
to
focus
the
whole
argument
on
whether
the
test
predicts
job
performance,
but
this
would
be
to
unjustly
penalize
the
civil
service
commission
and
the
district
of
columbia,
essentially
if
the
question
of
latches
and
the
presumptive
of
regularity.
nobody
can
take
issue
with
the
notion
that
we
live
in
an
age
in
which
an
evolving
body
of
law
has
made
a
policeman's
job
more
complex.
we
submit
then
that
it
is
only
fair,
that
(inaudible)
police
department
be
permitted
to
ensure
that
those
recruits
that
it
would
hire,
have
the
necessary
degree
of
verbal
ability
to
learn
the
basic
tools
of
the
police
trade.
we
submit
that
the
metropolitan
police
department
has
done
this,
well
at
the
same
time
boasting
an
equal
employment
opportunity
record
which
is
one
of
the
very
best
in
the
nation,
if
not
the
best
in
the
nation.
as
judge
gazelle
said,
the
metropolitan
police
department
has
been
an
example.
a
clear
example
of
bridging
racial
barriers.
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
more
that,
we
ask
this
court
to
permit
the
summary
judgment
ruling
of
the
district
court
to
stand
and
i
shall
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor
there
is
no
question,
we
do
not
hide
the
fact
that
considerably
more
blacks
failed
test
21
than
passed
it.
we
submit
that
that
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
conjunction
with
other
factors.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
we
submit
that
is
not
enough
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof,
this
court
in
the
albermarle
case,
put
the
question
more
so
on
the
basis
of
overall
hiring
results
rather
than
on
to
the
basis
of
test
results.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
think
it
is
a
the
factor,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor,
maybe
if
your
honor's
question
is
the
full
responsibility
upon
us,
if
your
honor's
question
is
that
ipso
facto
shift
the
burden
of
showing
my
answer
is
no,
that
does
not.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
it
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
by
the
court
in
connection
with
many
other
factors
as
did
court
in
smith
versus
city.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
we
submit
that
it
does
not;
it
would
perhaps
that
we
did
not
have
the
other
badges
of
credibility
that
are
depicted
by
this
record
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no,
such
as
the
fact
that
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
aggressive
recruitment
compares
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
judge
gazelle
said
that
it
has
been
a
nationwide
model
for
bridging
racial
barriers.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it
was
in
the
new
york
times
article
which
compares
with
other
departments,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
there
are
many
other
cases
your
honor
that
show
worst
track
records
and
counsel
has
said
there
is
a
plethora
of
these
cases
in
his
brief.
i
have
never
read
a
case
that
shows
the
police
department
with
a
better
equal
employment
record.
if
there
is
one
maybe
counsel
can
tell
this
court
about
it,
if
there
is
one,
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
would
not
be
very
many.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
your
honor,
we
must
rely
upon
the
totality
of
the
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
your
honor,
we
must
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right,
we
must
rely
upon
the
totality
of
the
statistical
data,
but
i
think
that
it
should
be
counterbalanced
with
this
court's
pronouncement
in
one
of
its
cases,
statistics
tell
much
in
court's
lesson
we
submit
there
are
overwhelming
statistical
data
in
this
record
which
apart
from
the
statement
of
having
a
good
track
record,
will
negate
the
adverse
impact
and
we
say
this,
not
withstanding
the
past
failure
rate.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor,
i
understand
first
of
all,
it
is
very
light,
because
job
relatedness
is
a
contextual
consideration,
as
we
have
a
law
review
article
on
this,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
dovetails
nicely
with
albermarle.
one
of
the
factors
that
should
lighten
the
employers
burden
is
the
insubstantiality
of
the
impact,
if
the
impact
there
be,
another
factors
is
the
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
that
test
21
is
related
to
ones
ability
to
be
trained
as
a
policeman.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no,
verbal
ability
is
needed
to
succeed
in
the
police
training
academy.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it
is
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
that
is
our
position,
but
we
do
not
ask
the
court,
because
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
verbal
ability
relates
to
the
job
after
recruit
school.
so
we
submit
that
it
does
as
judge
rob
said.
we
think
we
can
structure
much
narrower
rule.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
think
we
should,
if
you
view
the
community
as
the
district
of
columbia
itself,
perhaps
it
might
be
one
thing,
but
if
you
view
the
community
in
terms
of
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
and
the
district
by
statute
and
if
the
person
does
to
not
live
within
the
district,
to
be
a
metropolitan
police
officer,
he
can
live
within
a
20
mile
radius,
now
the
court
your
honest
question
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
that
would
be
wrong,
and
there
would
be
a
quarter
system.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
that
would
be
improper.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
the
legislative
history
appears
to
indicate
that
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
would
say
so
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand
if
turns
out
that
way.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
think
the
title
vii
has
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
case,
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
brushed
aside.
the
time,
the
case
was
tried
the
title
vii
was
not
applicable
to
district
but
the
equal
protection
concept
was
and
this
would
certainly
bring
in
your
title
vii
criteria.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
your
honor
i
do
not.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
do
your
honor
yes.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
we
have
met
--
if
the
civil
service
regulations
were
around
the
books
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
the
test
would
have
passed
master.
the
test
passes
master
on
the
eeoc
guidelines.
of
course
we
realize
that
they
have
not
been
adopted
in
the
totality
by
this
court.
but
it
meets
most
of
the
features
of
the
guidelines.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
72
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
would
have
to
say
no,
but
i
would
say
locally,
a
larger
number
of
negroes
was
hired
than
whites
over
the
9
month
period
that
is
referred
to
in
the
affidavit
of
the
department
demonstrative
services
officer.
i
will
have
to
say
no,
a
larger
percentage
of
negroes
was
not
hired,
but
a
larger
number
was
locally
and
we
refer
to
the
affidavit
of
the
department's
administrative
service
office
that
contained
at
pages
66
and
80
of
the
appendix.
we
point
out
that
it
just
relates
locally
now.
during
the
final
6
months
of
1969,
mr.
chief
wilson
took
office
and
during
the
first
three
months
in
1970,
let
us
take
the
latter,
the
first
nine
months
of
1970,
i
think
it
was
504
blacks
and
401
whites,
but
percentage
wise
we
are
hired.
but
more
blacks
failed
the
test,
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
perhaps
that
so.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right
test
passers
as
distinct
from,
i
have
got
your
question
out,
test
passers
as
distinguished
from
test
takers,
right.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
and
the
language
of
the
sixth
circuit,
in
the
smith
case
which
i
understand
is
now
pending
before
this
court,
the
impact
should
be
an
overall
hiring
results,
not
test
results
considered
in
isolation.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
it
is
does
not
violate
the
title
vii.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
if
it
turns
out
in
a
way,
that
there
are
more
blacks
hired
working
for
the
department.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
you
now
had
a
problem
here
you
have
a
merit
system,
you
have
a
system
where
the
persons
with
the
highest
scores
get
the
job,
now
that
does
not
enter
into
consideration
here
because
at
the
time
this
test
was
given
everybody
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
okay.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
there
are
no
circumstances;
there
probably
would
be
a
quarter
systems
that
would
be
improper
under
title
vii.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
a
few
brief
points
your
honor,
in
an
answer
to
the
most
recent
question.
i
respectfully
submit
that
counsel
himself
expressed
a
contrary
view
in
an
article
written
by
him
in
harvard
law
review.
some
test
have
an
obvious
relevance
to
business
needs
and
can
clearly
be
justified
for
reasonable
use
as
a
criterion
for
employment
decision.
a
typist
must
know
how
to
type
and
a
proof
reader
must
reasonably
proficient
at
proof
reading
and
to
this
it
might
be
added
in
the
language
of
judge
gazelle,
the
ability
to
swing
a
night
stick
no
longer
measures
a
policeman
exacting
role.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
your
honor
it
is
not,
but
it
should
be
the
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
he
was
right
the
first
time
and
we
should
not
discount
common
sense
in
the
handling
of
cases.
now
another
point
that
is
very
crucial.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right!
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor
all
i
can
say
to
you
there
is
that
the
federal
government
putting
an
affidavit
of
a
psychologist
which
counsel
did
not
dispute,
the
affidavit
of
diane
wilson,
which
equates
the
verbal
ability
with
test
21,
with
that
require
to
get
to
recruit
school,
and
that
same
psychologist
analyze
study
materials.
but
the
most
important
point
i
would
make
and
that
is
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stevens
and
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
about
the
correlation
between
the
test
and
the
high
school
education
requirement.
counsel
did
not
accurately
answer
that
question.
futransky
himself
points
out,
and
again
this
is
an
undisputed
fact
on
the
summary
judgment
record,
at
page
100
of
the
record
that
by
setting
a
standard
of
the
35
right
and
additional
15%
of
applicants
would
be
eligible,
this
standard
would
still
represent
the
reading
level
of
at
least
the
11th
grade.
however,
it
would
by
fairness
and
by
the
same
logic
represent
verbal
ability
below
the
high
school
education
level,
and
it
would
run
counterproductive
to
the
high
school
education
requirement,
the
sufficiently
of
which
counsel
concedes,
but
let
us
not
stop
there.
we
live
in
a
time
when
authoritative
study
throughout
the
country
is
saying
we
should
have
more
than
the
high
school
education.
and
nonetheless
counsel
with
lower
the
cutting
score
below
40
have
the
department
cut
the
ocean
debts
to
see
what
the
most
possible
workable
cut
off
score
is.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
high
school
level
your
honor?
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
think
that
we
can
be
concerned
with
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it
means
the
proper
high
school
education
requirement.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
in
general,
we
put
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
have
to
use
the
term
high
school
education
in
a
general
sense
that
would
work
about
the
same
way
to
the
president’s
crime
commission
did.
when
the
president’s
crime
commission
use
the
term
or
expression
high
school
education
it
meant
a
proper
high
school
education
with
its
attendant
verbal
ability
and
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
this
maybe
so
your
honor
but
the
question
is
how
does
this
effect
the
right
of
the
community
to
a
captain
police
force.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
right
and
it
has
a
cutting
score
of
--
as
a
factual
matter
of
40
or
80,
a
50%
of
grade,
it
is
not
really
asking
too
much,
and
in
spite
of
this
mr.
justice
marshall
the
black
component
of
the
department
has
sparrow
and
even
though
this
cutting
score
has
remained
the
same
and
the
passing
rate
is
remained
the
same.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
yes
your
honor.
one
of
the
points
--
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
made
a
response
to
your
question
what
more
do
we
have
to
decide
as
waving
a
flag
and
saying
we
are
model
for
recruitment.
we
have
cold
print,
we
have
statistics
which
shows
that
between
1900
and
65,
the
effect
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
the
present.
the
departments
black
component
has
increased
from
17%
to
41%,
and
we
do
not
think
this
can
be
ignored.
now
the
other
point
i
would
make
is
that
the
federal
respondents
tried
to
downplay
this
verbal
ability
but
they
themselves
put
in
the
record
all
kinds
of
affidavit
saying
that
verbal
ability
is
a
critical
factor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
no
your
honor
it
has
not
and
in
the
response
to
counsel’s
assertion
that
we
have
an
intervening
circumstance
to
move
the
case,
we
submit
that
counsel
wants
to
bring
a
new
action,
we
can
prove
that
verbal
ability
is
still
a
critical
factor
under
the
department’s
current
training
program
and
it
gives
the
same
test.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it
is
sure
is.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
the
training
is
changed,
but
verbal
ability
is
still
a
factor.
the
only
final
point
i
would
make,
you
may
recall
it
and
in
response
the
questions
posed
by
mr.
justice
white,
we
discussed
this
factor
of
a
quota
system.
well
the
courts
do
not
impose
quota
systems;
they
do
impose
goals
to
redress
previous
racial
imbalance
of
carter
versus
gallagher
was
the
case
in
point
and
this
massachusetts
case
is
the
case
of
point.
they
said
to
atone
the
sense
of
past
discrimination
hire
so
many
blacks
until
you
bring
your
black
component
of
your
department
up
to
a
certain
level.
this
is
to
be
distinguished
from
quotas,
and
this
is
when
upheld
notwithstanding
title
vii.
now,
the
question
was
also
asked,
what
are
we
going
to
do
here
if
we
remand
the
case?
subject
to
metropolitan
police
department
to
a
procedure
like
that.
we
have
already
done
it.
we
hire
one
black
policeman’s
to
every
one
white
policeman,
52%
of
all
officers
out
of
the
most
recent
statistics
which
we
put
in
our
reply
brief
are
black.
how
then
could
this
case
be
remanded
for
us
to
adhere
to
a
goal
in
order
to
redress
a
past
racial
imbalance
in
order
to
atone
for
past
sense
of
racial
discrimination.
the
answer
is
there
are
no
such
sense
and
to
this
case,
this
test
produces
no
adverse
impact.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it
did
not
say
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
it
went
to
leave
out
the
judge
gisele.
mr.
david
p.
sutton
i
would
assume
so,
and
another
point
about
this
business
that
well
that
is
all
been
changed
by
new
recruit
program
is
that
back
pay
has
been
sought
here.
back
pay
has
been
allowed
by
this
court
in
albermarle
and
in
a
case
involving
the
federal
government,
chambers
versus
united
states.
in
fact
the
court
of
claims
held
there
could
be
back
pay.
of
course
chambers
involved
intentional
discrimination;
this
case
was
not.
i
respectfully
submit
the
case
and
we
ask
your
honors
to
permit
the
district
court
summary
judgment
ruling
to
remain
undisturbed.
thank
you.
