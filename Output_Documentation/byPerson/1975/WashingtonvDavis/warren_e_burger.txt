chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
74-1492,
washington
against
davis.
mr.
sutton
you
may
proceed
when
ever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
to
the
district
judge
of
the
united
state
district
court
who
is
dealing
with
search
and
seizure,
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
in
carey
case
and
miranda
is
better
able
to
make
an
evaluation
of
what
it
takes
to
make
a
policeman
than
some
clinical
psychologist
is
able
to
make.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
i
did
not
understand
you
said
that
griggs
police
department,
but
that
you
had
the
best
record
on
racial
matters
of
any
metropolitan
police
department
in
the
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
to
anyone
prompt
scrutiny
of
the
underlying
factors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
it
is
not
of
course,
does
not
dictate
a
per
se
conclusion
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
prove
of
anything
it
merely
suggest
the
court
should
look
at
it
or
someone
should
look
at
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
sutton.
mr.
evans.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
understand
your
position,
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify,
this
is
my
understanding
of
it.
is
not
the
position
of
the
united
state
department
of
justice
in
this
case
or
generally
that
verbal
ability
is
not
a
key
imperative
for
the
function
of
a
policeman
particularly
on
a
metropolitan
police
force,
when
he
must
understand
as
the
arguments
just
last
week
before
this
court
in
two
cases
were
made
that
he
must
understand
the
boyd
case,
he
must
understand
the
weeks
case,
he
must
understand
miranda,
he
must
understand
terry
and
the
new
answers
of
all
of
those
cases.
now
is
it
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
that
you
need
a
psychologist
to
tell
you
whether
verbal
skills
are
related
to
that
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
applications
for
warrants
must
be
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
was
argued
to
us
only
last
week
that
if
the
judge
in
issuing
the
warrant
makes
a
mistake,
that
he
ought
to
be
skillful
enough
to
recognize
that
the
judge
has
made
a
mistake
in
issuing
the
warrant
and
not
execute
the
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
hat
is
why
the
district
court
is
listed
quite
low.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sobol.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sobol,
i
suggested
to
your
friend
solicitor
general
from
boyd
and
weeks
down
to
most
recent,
do
you
suggest
that
verbal
skills
are
not
highly
important?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
jury
in
general
agreement
with
mr.
suttonâ€™s
position
that
verbal
skills
are
crucial
to
police
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
would
verify
just
one
thing
that
we
have
been,
i
have
touched
on,
mr.
justice
white
touched
on.
the
griggs
case
announced
in
other
cases
following
--
including
albermarle
paper
are
consistent
with
that,
that
the
test
must
be
job
related
which
obviously
means
related
to
the
job
to
be
performed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
is
it
your
view
that
united
states
district
judge
who
was
dealing
with
these
matters
constantly,
looking
at
a
test
that
measures
verbal
skills
must
have
the
expert
testimony
of
the
clinical
psychologist
or
an
educational
psychologist
in
order
to
make
a
judgment
about
whether
that
test
is
related
to
the
job,
not
whether
it
is
the
best
test
or
the
perfect
test
but
whether
is
it
related
to
the
job.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
sobol.
mr.
sutton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
simply
saying
he
was
right
at
the
first
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
why
test
21
is
added
to
the
high
school
requirement
to
see
you
whether
they
are
part
of
the
high
school
crop
who
cannot
read.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
