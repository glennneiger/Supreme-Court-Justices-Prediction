mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
powell,
i
think
that
in
essence,
the
standards
are
the
same
under
title
vii
as
they
are
under
the
equal
protection
concept
because
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
at
the
same
point.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
the
same
analysis
that
this
court
is
adopted
in
griggs
under
title
vii
ought
properly
apply—
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
right
but
it
was
a
title
vii,
but
i
believe
that
the
analysis
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
discrimination
found
in
that
case
or
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
i
am
not
sure,
i
had
be
prepared
the
generalize
question
from
mr.
justice
powell,
but
i
think
in
the
context
of
a
testing
challenge,
it
is
reasonable
to
make
the
same
analysis
that
the
court
made
under
title
vii,
i
mean
the
basic
standard
is
the
same.
title
vii
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
sex
color,
religion.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
not
sufficient
for?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
frankly,
have
not
addressed
myself
to
this
question
because
it
has
not
been
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right
and
for
the
future
title
vii
standards
govern
for
all
public
employers.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that
is
the
way
i
thought
about
the
case
and
just
the
way
the
parties
have
approached
it
that
this
is
basically
a
title
vii
case
and
well,
i
have
not
fell
through
all
the
ramifications
of
applying
a
standard
griggs
analysis
to
a
case
which
was
brought
at
the
time
when
title
vii
was
not
yet
applicable
to
the
district,
given
the
nature
of
the
issue
for
the
future.
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
treat
it
that
way
since
the
parties
then
prepare
to
treat
it
that
way.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
it
was
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
1981.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
believe
it
was,
i
should
add
that
there
is
one
other
complicating
factor
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
statute
which
can
be
read
as
requiring
the
civil
service
commission
to
ensure
that
all
of
its
test
are
job
relative
regardless
of
any
adverse
impact.
that
the
application
of
that
statute
to
this
case
was
viewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
not
presented
by
this
case
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
same
job
relatedness
burden
would
fall
upon
the
defendants
in
this
case
in
any
event
as
as
public
employers.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
there
is
an
attack
on
it,
at
least
to
the
point
–
mr.
mark
l.
evans
at
least
to
the
point
of
shifting
the
burden
to
the
defendants
to
come
forward
with
some
proof.
where
you
--
i
mean,
the
presumption
can
only
be
carried
so
far
and
where
the
plaintiffs
have
established
a
dramatic
adverse
racial
impact
of
the
test,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
impose
upon
the
defendants
the
burden
of
at
least
presenting
evidence
showing
that
indeed
the
burden
of
job
relatedness
proving
job
relatedness
has
been
met.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
analysis
does
not
really
focus
so
much
mr.
justice
stevens
on
verbal
ability.
it
is
true
that
this
test
was
designed.
test
21
was
designed
was
by
the
civil
service
commission
as
a
test
of
verbal
ability.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
know
one
way
or
the
other,
because
this
record
does
not
clearly
answer
it,
the
studies
that
were
conducted
as
to
the
validity
of
the
test
did
not
go
to
whether
or
not
it
adequately
measured
verbal
ability
as
a
trait.
what
it
went
to
was
the
question
whether
on
the
hypothesis
that
it
measured
verbal
ability
and
there
is
some
evidence
that
it
does
but
not
definitive.
on
the
hypothesis
that
it
measured
verbal
ability
whether
scores
on
that
test
were
reasonably
predictive
of
scores
on
recruit
school
examinations.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that
would
require
a
professional
--
different
kind
of
professional
ability.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
could
be
your
successful
performance
of
the
training
school.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
is
fine
as
a
general
proposition
but
professionals
in
the
field
have
been
quick
to
warn,
lay
persons
and
making
the
kinds
of
judgment
that
judge
rob
made
which
is
a
basically
a
lay
judgment,
resting
perhaps
on
an
accurate
notion
or
perhaps
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
is
correct
if
--
but
i
want
to
emphasis
that
this
case
does
not
hinge
on
such
as
a
showing.
there
is
no
adequate
evidence
as
to
that
in
this
record
but
that
is
not
what
was
shouldered
by
the
defendants
in
this
case,
they
were
not
trying
to
demonstrate,
a)
that
police
officers
had
to
have
verbal
ability
and
(b)
that
this
test
is
an
adequate
measure
of
verbal
ability.
they
were
hypothesizing
that
verbal
ability
would
likely
be
something
needed
to
succeed
in
the
training
school
and
then
they
were
finding
out
whether
on
the
basis
of
that
hypothesis,
scores
on
the
test
entry
test
were
reasonably
predictive
of
scores
in
training
so
that
one
could
say
as
i
believe
that
the
evidence
demonstrates.
that
the
higher
one
scores
on
the
entry
test
the
more
likely
he
is
to
achieve
satisfactory
scores
on
the
recruit
school
test,
that
is
called
the
criterion
related
validity
study
under
the
technical
jargon
and
it
is
quite
different
in
concepts
and
in
form,
from
what
we
are
talking
about
the
verbal
ability
test
which
would
be
studied
under
construct
validity
model.
by
which
you
determine
what
traits
are
needed
for
the
job
and
whether
at
the
particular
test
is
a
reasonable
measure
of
that
trait.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
the
issue
was
not
wholly
free
of
ambiguity,
but
i
believe
it
is
fair
to
say
that
if
a
test
was
designed
and
used
to
measure
the
capacity
of
a
particular
person,
the
ability
of
a
particular
applicant
to
do
something,
a
trait
or
what
is
called
the
construct,
that
if
there
was
a
proof
that
this
test
adequately
measured,
was
an
adequately
designed
test
to
measure
that
trait
and
if
there
was
some
proof
in
the
record.
maybe
or
maybe
not
the
psychological
but
probably
psychological
in
nature
to
suggest
that
trait
was
an
important
part
of
the
job.
that
would
i
think
establish
job
relatedness.
in
our
view,
there
are
two
things
missing
from
the
record
that
makes
it
difficult
to
answer
the
question
whether
this
test
is
job
related
under
the
model
of
validation
that
was
used
by
the
psychologist
here.
what
is
missing
is
that
there
has
been
shown
a
correlation
between
the
scores
on
the
entry
test
and
scores
under
recruit
school
examinations.
what
is
not
apparent
from
the
record
is
whether
and
to
what
extent
there
is
any
reasonable
relationship
between
the
recruit
school
examinations
and
the
recruit
school
curriculum.
that
is
do
this
examinations
or
did
these
examinations
adequately
measure
mastery
of
the
training
school
curriculum?
mr.
sutton
has
pointed
out
that
these
examinations
as
they
were
used
in
1963
at
least
may
not
be
available
anymore.
that
is
not
to
say
some
subsequent
examination
might
not
serve
the
purpose
for
this
case.
but
in
any
event
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
to
explore
this
question
because
without
it,
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
whether
you
are
measuring
a
correlation
between
the
entry
test
of
some
job
performance
measure
or
just
entry
test
in
some
abstraction
and
the
second
thing
that
missing
is
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
that
practice,
that
is
the
kind
of
presumption
that
the
defendants
were
operating
under
at
the
time
of
trial
in
this
case
and
it
may
well
have
been
appropriate
at
the
time
and
what
is
caused
us
to
look
at
the
matter
again
is
that
standards
have
been
in
a
state
of
evolution
since
the
time
this
trial
was
conducted
and
more
significantly
and
since
the
time
the
study
was
conducted
which
was
before
griggs
and
before
title
vii
was
extended
to
this.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
can
give
you
a
very
specific
example
on
that
point
because
the
applicable
professional
standards
which
are
ideals
and
not
necessarily
the
minimum
that
must
be
accomplished
but
the
ideals
to
strive
for
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
these
are
publish
by
the
american
psychological
association.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
for
one
thing
they
are
referred
to
and
in
effect
incorporated
by
reference
by
the
eeoc
guidelines.
i
mean
they
are
generally
looked
to
as
the
source
for
what
the
governing
professional
standards
are
to
determine
whether
a
validity
study
is
an
adequate
one
to
show
what
it
is
intended
to
show,
and
these
standards
have
changed
quite
significantly
since
1966,
which
is
what
the
prior
version
which
was
cited
by
the
court
in
albermarle,
and
on
that
particular
point
there
was
nothing
in
the
1966
standards
relating
to
whether
or
not
the
criterion
measure,
that
is
the
training
school
exams
were
related
significantly
to
the
criteria,
namely
training
success.
in
this
document
it
becomes
apparent
that
the
professional
consensus
is
now
is
that
is
a
relevant
inquiry
in
determining
job
relatedness
and
this
evolution
has
been.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
there
is
nothing.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mthere
is
nothing
to
prevent
it
and
indeed
they
say
in
their
document
quite
clearly.
they
have
not
written
these
standards
to
be
used
as
law
that
this
is
a
growing
profession
indeed
in
its
infancy
and
there
are
maybe
changes
of
mind.
the
only
point
of
relying
upon
them
is
that
the
source
as
a
guide
really
just
as
the
agencies
themselves
formulate
guidelines
which
themselves
change.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
one
can
hypothesize
fairly
that
that
is
a
substantial
part
of
a
police
officer's
job.
well,
it
is
after
all
an
assumption
we
are
making
it
is
not
something
that
we
know
we
have
not
i
assume
studied
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
let
me
assume
for
a
moment
that
is
an
important
and
substantial
part
of
a
police
officer's
job,
this
study
that
was
presented
in
this
case
to
support
the
job
relatedness
of
test
21
was
not
designed
to
show
the
extent
to
which
test
21
measured
verbal
ability.
that
was
not
the
model
by
which
the
validation
was
undertaken.
it
was
undertaken
under
this
other
model
which
i
mentioned
the
criterion
in
related
validity.
there
is
some
statement
in
the
expert
affidavits
in
the
case
that
test
21
does
measure
verbal
ability
and
that
verbal
ability
is
needed
to
past
the
training
school.
but
that
is
not
what
was
attempted
to
be
shouldered
by
the
professional
validation
study
submitted
to
this
court
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
fair
to
infer
from
the
evidence
before
the
court
that
the
test
has
been
showing
job
related
by
a
professionally
acceptable
method
as
to
the
job
relatedness,
as
to
the
verbal
ability
aspect
of
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
think
i
did,
the
second
is
that
assuming
for
a
moment
that
there
is
a
basis
for
relating
the
recruit
school
examination
scores
to
the
content
of
the
training
program,
that
one
measures
the
other,
there
is
not
adequate
evidence
in
the
record,
in
our
view
to
relate
the
recruit
school
curriculum
to
the
job
of
the
police
officer.
again,
there
is
i
think
nonprofessionals
can
find
it
easy
to
make
assumptions
by
looking
at
the
curriculum
itself
and
then
assuming
what
we
all
know
a
little
bit
about
to
the
police
officer's
job
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
ought
to
be
something
in
the
evidence
showing
what
it
is,
the
police
officers
do
once
they
get
out
of
training
school
in
order
to
justify
the
use
of
this
training
school
as
the
measure
of
the
criterion
for
justifying
the
entry
test.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
it
may
in
certain
cases
but
i
think
that
there
is
no
reason
to
establish
that
as
an
automatic
rule.
i
think
in
a
case
like
this
for
example,
it
maybe
perfectly
adequate
to
have
police
officers
in
a
supervisory
capacity
come
in
and
testify
but
it
is
question
of
a
fact.
testify
as
to
what
a
police
officer
does
and
then
compare
that
with
the
curriculum.
now,
in
some
case
it
is
going
to
be
necessary
to
have
what
the
psychologist
called
a
job
analysis,
to
decide
in
a
more
technical
field
perhaps
to
decide
what
it
is
that
the
person
is
really
doing
on
the
job.
but
whether
it
is
required
in
this
case
or
not
it
seems
to
me
is
itself
a
question
that
ought
to
be
resolved
by
the
district
court.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
have
read
many
of
them.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
could
i?
i
do
not
take
the
test
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
hope
i
could.
they
are
not
all
that
difficult,
they
are
designed
to
be
high
school
level.
they
are
designed
to
measure
of
what
a
high
school
student,
high
school
graduate
is
like
to
be
able
to
answer.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
let
me
state
again
although
i
hesitate
to
admonish
the
court
or
suggest
to
the
court
again
that
the
psychologist
would
frown
in
what
we
are
doing
here,
this
is
called
in
the
psychological
jargon,
a
study
of
face
validity
that
as
you
at
the
look
at
the
test
and
you
decide
on
the
basis,
looking
at
it
whether
it
is
measures
something
important
or
whether
it
is
a
good
test
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
used.
everybody
in
the
profession
at
least
and
i
think
everybody
in
this
case
agrees,
that
is
not
an
appropriate
inquiry.
that
the
appropriate
inquiry
is
a
professional
one
and
indeed,
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
albermarle
makes
clear
that
job
relatedness
depends
on
a
showing
based
on
professionally
acceptable
methods
and
face
validity
that
is
looking
at
the
face,
the
test
is
simply
not
such
a
method.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
is
that
not
all
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no
as
we
say
on
our
brief
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
as
we
say
in
the
brief
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
not
all
together
clear
whether
the
evidence
is
available
or
has
been
retained
or
can
be
reconstructed.
mr.
sutton
has
said
today
that
the
tests
that
were
used
as
the
basis
of
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
and
an
inquiry
should
be
made
as
to
whether
there
is
evidence
that
can
be
presented
on
these
issues,
if
there
is
not
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
in
part,
the
inquiry
depends
upon
what
the
district
has
available
but
my
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
am
sorry?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
–
i
was
going
to
say,
i
think
the
inquiry
should
be
made
as
to
whether
the
evidence
exists.
if
it
does
not
exist,
i
think
there
is
a
further
inquiry
to
be
made
whether
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
whether
the
plaintiffs
failure
to
specifically
raise
these
particular
weaknesses
that
we
have
identified
at
any
time
the
district
court
contributed
to
the
non-existence
of
the
evidence
at
this
point
and
if
so
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
did.
there
are
times,
i
think
even
when
both
parties
believed
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
that
turns
out
not
to
be
appropriate.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
these
particular
weaknesses
aside
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
some
respects,
no.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
is
not,
it
is
weaknesses
in
the
joint
case
put
on
by
the
defendants
in
the
district
court
in
light
of
what
we
think
are
the
current
standards
and
whether
--
another
inquiry
in
the
district
might
quite
properly
be
whether
even
if
the
evidence
today
or
the
evidence
in
the
district
court
turns
out
not
be
sufficient
under
the
standards.
we
have
articulated
as
what
we
think
to
be
current
standards.
whether
it
might
have
been
appropriate,
it
might
have
been
satisfactory
under
the
standards
that
existed
then.
as
i
have
said
there
is
reasonably
that
standards
have
evolved
substantially.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
i
think
i
have
articulated
that
we
are
not
clear,
what
evidence
is
available,
but
there
are
matters
for
inquiry.
i
think
appropriately
in
the
district
court
even
if
there
is
no
evidence
available
and
that
is
where
does
the
brunt
of
that
failure
fall
at
this
point?
seems
to
me
the
problem
is
this,
they
are
really
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
can
of
my
–
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
but
who
did
not
raise
it?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
but
neither
did
the
petitioners
and
they
after
all
do
have
some
burdens
on
litigation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
there
are
really
several
alternatives.
one
is
to
do
what
i
think
would
be
inappropriate
which
is
to
say
here
are
the
applicable
standards.
let
us
look
at
the
proof.
the
proof
does
not
meet
them
therefore
summary
judgment
in
favor
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
affirmed.
that
is
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs.
the
other
alternative
is
to
say
well,
the
plaintiffs
never
raised
this
issue
in
the
district
court
therefore
the
absence
of
these
relevant
materials
in
the
evidence
today
is
too
bad
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
i
am
suggesting
an
alternative
which
would
send
it
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
plaintiff?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
let
me
go
to
the
--
this
quite
goes
to
a
question
of
burden
shifting.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that
the
plaintiffs
met
their
threshold
burden
of
establishing
adverse
racial
impact.
arguably,
the
defendants
met
their
burden
of
proving
job
relatedness
by
submitting
what
we
think
now
is
partial
evidence
and
with
the
general
statement
by
its
experts
that
this
met
the
applicable
standards
and
proved
relatedness.
in
the
absence
then
of
a
specific
attack
by
the
plaintiffs
on
the
weakness
that
we
now
feel,
we
are
vulnerable
on,
perhaps
they
should
bear
the
burden
of
having
failed
or
having
failed
to
raise
the
weaknesses
that
we
now
perceived
in
the
evidence
that
we
presented.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
same
can
be
asked
to
the
defendants.
how
could
the
defendants
have
been
asked
to
produce
evidence
on
matters
that
nobody
identify
this
being
an
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
am
sorry.
i
meant
the
respondent.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
as
i
have
indicated
this
that
standard
was
met.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
