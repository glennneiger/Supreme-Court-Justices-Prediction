justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
seems
to
me,
you
can
make
your
point,
we
can
agree
with
you
in
that
regard
without
feeling
that
this
court
is
the
forum
in
first
instance
that
ought
to
make
these
decision
as
to
opposed
to
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
you
would
argue
on
better
ground
if
you
said
it
because
it
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
district
court
not
because
it
is
a
question
of
rational
basis
for
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
title
vii
become
applicable
to
district,
72?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
evans,
in
jefferson
versus
hackney,
we
said
that
statistics
standing
alone
were
not
sufficient.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
sufficient
to
make
out
an
equal
protection
claim
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
of
intent
to
discriminate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
is
important
i
mean
that
title
vii
is
the
applicable
now
to
the
district.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
might
be
quite
important
in
another
context,
but
is
it
at
least
arguable
here
that
we
should
apply
a
title
vii
standard.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
there
is
no
any
presumption
at
all
in
the
case
of
an
employer
that
he
puts
on
a
school
and
gives
you
a
test
at
the
end
of
the
school
that
the
test
is
after
be
based
on
what
is
taught
in
the
school?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
evolved
with
respect
to
that
particular
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
these
come
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
legal
state
as
to
they
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
have
to
be
shown
by
the
testimony
of
a
professional
psychologist?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sobol
your
prayer
in
the
district
court
was
basically
for
the
declaratory
judgment,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
well
certainly
so
far
as
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
are
concerned,
that
has
never
been
issued
by
the
district
court
in
your
favor
anyway
since
1972
to
title
vii
has
applied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
declaratory
judgment
that
you
would
now
get
or
injunctive
relief
that
you
would
now
get
would
have
to
based
on
title
vii
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
useful
purpose
or
indeed
what
case
or
controversy
would
the
district
court
be
deciding,
if
it
were
to
now
enter
a
declaratory
judgment
or
an
injunction
one
way
or
the
other
in
this
case
based
on
the
law
that
governed
in
the
district
of
columbia
before
1972?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
not
any
act
presumed
constitutional
and
the
burden
of
showing
it
is
unconstitutional
falls
on
him,
would
attack
it.
so
is
it
not
the
proper
phrasing
of
the
equal
protection
test
that
the
plaintiff
was
challenging
the
governmental
action
on
equal
protection
clause
has
to
show
that
there
is
no
rational
connection
rather
than
--
yes
it
is
a
legal
really
not
a
factual.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course
there
is
a
classification
in
every
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whether
it
measures
the
skill
but
that
goes
to
the
question
of
how
much
of
the
skill
you
want?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
those
are
two
different
inquiries.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
fit
your
rationality
analysis?
assuming
that
you
concede
that
verbal
skills
are
necessary
to
perform
a
policemanâ€™s
job
and
assuming
it
is
established
to
your
satisfaction
that
this
test
measures
verbal
skills
to
some
extent
along
the
lines
of
justice
white's
question.
what
more
in
your
view
do
you
need
to
have
to
establish
rationality
from
an
equal
protection
analysis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
test
21
obviously
adds
something
since
many
high
school
diplomat
failed
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
counsel
found
as
an
advocate
by
everything
he
may
have
said
as
an
author,
i
would
hope
not.
