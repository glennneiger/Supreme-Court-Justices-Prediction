justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
decided
on
both
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sobol,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
think
the
rational
basis
test
is
the
appropriate
one
and
that
therefore
be
a
rational
relationship
that
between
the
test
and
the
job.
who
has
a
burden
of
showing
that
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
just
said
that
you
did
not
think
this
was
a
title
vii
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
standard
under
1981
is
different
from
the
constitutional
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were
agreed
that
was
nothing
but
a
straight
equal
protection
constitutional
issue,
i
understand
you
are
saying
that
if
the
plaintiff
proved
a
statistical
adverse
impact
the
burden
then
shifts
to
the
defendants.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
title
vii
standard
are
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
second
court,
is
any
decision
at
this
court
that
support
showed
you
as
to
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
in
an
equal
protection
case,
merely
on
the
basis
of
statistical
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
question
of
whether
or
not
if
the
racial
classification
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
test
has
an
independent
neutral
justification
namely,
the
job
relatedness.
and
the
job
relatedness
issue
may
determine
how
we
decide
the
classification
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
let
me
just
ask
you
the
one
last
question
and
i
will
be
through.
i
have
asked
the
others
this
question,
i
would
like
to
show
you
how
you
address
it
before
you
sit
down.
on
the
question
of
job
relatedness,
do
you
contend
there
is—that
is
not
a
measure
of
a
verbal
ability
or
that
verbal
ability
is
not
an
aspect
of
the
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
assume
the
greater
correlation
between
verbal
ability
for
a
policeman’s
job
and
the
jobs
involved
in
griggs
i
think
would
you
not
agreed
of
that?
i
think
the
assumption
there
was
there
is
a
total
absence
correlation
between
the
particular
test
and
the
particular
jobs
at
stake.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
third
case,
i
have
is
74-1492
washington,
mayor
of
washington,
d.c.
against
davis.
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
standard
test
administered
to
prospective
civil
service
employees
of
the
united
states
is
racially
discriminatory
and
violative
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
when
it
is
administered
to
applicants
for
the
positions
on
the
metropolitan
police
force
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
not
and
sustained
the
test.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
test
had
a
discriminatory
impact
and
was
therefore
unconstitutional
whether
or
not
a
discriminatory
purpose
had
been
demonstrated.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
proved
and
unconstitutional
racial
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
or
due
process
clauses,
it
is
essential
that
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
be
shown
in
some
manner.
we
also
hold
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
sustaining
the
test
under
the
applicable
statutory
standards.
we
consequently
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
stewart
joins
parts
1
and
2
of
the
opinion,
but
not
the
remainder.
mr.
justice
stevens

filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
