that
is
a
total
of
44%
of
all
the
applicants
of
both
of
all
races
were
hired?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sutton,
the
court
would
never
get
to
this
question
if
you
are
right
in
your
first
point,
is
it
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
adverse
racial
impact,
then
any
inquiry
under
the
job
relatedness
of
the
test
is
never
reached.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
court
does
agree
with
in
your
first,
on
your
first
argument
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
our
decision
is
construing
the
statute
it
is,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
does
not
everybody
pass
recruit
school,
is
that
not
indicated
somewhere
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
are
we
arguing
as
to
whether
it
is
a
question
for
this
court
as
opposed
to
the
district
court
or
this
court
as
opposed
to
psychologist
or
the
district
court
as
opposed
to
psychologist,
i
presume
it
is
basically
a
fact
question
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
applicable
under
the
equal
protection
clause
or
identical
to
the
standards
applicable
under
title
vii?
justice
potter
stewart
all
you
have
to
show
under
the
equal
protection
clause
would
be
the
discriminatory
impact?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
making
no
distinction
between
equal
protection
and
title
vii
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
albermarle.
justice
potter
stewart
guilty.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
compliant
based
wholly
on
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitutions?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
substantively
upon
the
equal
protection
component
of
fifth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
not
at
all
upon
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
complaint
ever
amended?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
this,
to
the
amendment
title
vii,
applied
to
federal
employees
that
there
maybe
no
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court,
that
is
the
matter
that
we
are
going
to
consider
later
this
week.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
scope
of
the
trial
might
--.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sobol,
is
there
a
difference
between
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
the
dc
code,
the
third
basis
for
relief.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
not
mentioned
by
judge
robinson,
is
that
akin
to
1981
or
akin
to
title
vii
in
your
judgment?
if
there
is
a
different
between
the
two?
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
the
justices
were
assuming,
there
might
be
a
difference
from
the
constitutional
standard
and
the
title
vii
standard,
i
was
just
to
ask
if
you
assumed
arguendo
that
there
was
such
a
difference,
in
which
category
would
you
put
the
dc
code?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
whether
we
find
the
difference
or
not,
we
still
have
to
face
a
title
vii
type
case?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
dc
code.
justice
potter
stewart
your
hiring
figures
however
go
to
those
who
apply,
not
to
those
who
pass.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
narrow
the
pool
to
those
who
pass.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sobol
what
is
the
chronology
of
the
processing
and
what
was
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
the
chronology
from
the
time
of
application
to
the
time
of
becoming
a
probationary
policeman?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
application
for
example,
does
the
statistics
here
and
include
applicants
who
were
not
in
fact
high
school
graduates
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
form,
did
you
graduate
from
high
school?
no.
justice
potter
stewart
not
even
an
application.
justice
potter
stewart
and
presumably
the
other
requirements,
i.e.
what
is
your
age,
52.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
application?
justice
potter
stewart
was
your
age
16
would
that
be
an
application?
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
do
you
know
because
this
seems
to
be
quite
important.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
these
applications
included
in
the
statistics
in
the
record
are
all
applications
from
people
who
are
prima
facia
qualified
application,
high
school
graduate
between
20
and
29?
justice
potter
stewart
who
have,
whatever
the
other
requirements
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
return
to
my
racial
question,
i
am
sorry,
i
let
you
answer.
what
is
the
chronology
in
application?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
not
even
an
application
form
unless
his
oral
response
to
the
inquiry
indicates
that
he
is
prima
facia
eligible
that
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
he
fills
out
the
application
giving
his
name,
address,
age,
high
school
graduate,
blah,
blah,
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
down
there.
justice
potter
stewart
right
at
the
counter?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
individually
given
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
no
i
think
it
is
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
statistics
show
if
he
was
a
white
applicant,
how
many
are
white
applicants,
how
many
of
them
passed
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
the
87
and
all
of
the
43
would
then
go
to
the
training
program.
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
the
tests?
justice
potter
stewart
physical?
justice
potter
stewart
both
tests
and
now
what
are
the
statistics
about
that?
that
now
have
87
white
applicants
and
43
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
negro
applicants?
then
what
happens
to
these
87
and
43
between
the
time
of
passing
the
test
and
taking
the
training
program.
justice
potter
stewart
and
mental?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
the
87,
how
many
would
be
left
to
the
87?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
of
those
passers.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
is
means
37%
is
white.
justice
potter
stewart
38
or
39%
of
the
negros
presumably
then
passed
the
physical
and
the
character
and
the
mental.
what
is
the
mental,
is
that
something
additional
to
these
test?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
is
psychological?
justice
potter
stewart
not
mental,
not
intellectual?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
37%
would
be
something
like
35
people
out
of
the
87
and
some
18
people
out
of
the
43.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
to
say
that
here
certainly
we
will
bear
on
that
one.
justice
potter
stewart
presumably,
it
would
not
apply
to
bar
association
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
not
involve
employment.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sobol,
one
of
the
problems,
here
maybe
that
the
passing
grade
is
incorrectly
set.
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
passing
grade
is
determined
by
the
civil
service
commission
or
by
the
police
department
and
whether
it
is
the
same
or
different
from
the
passing
grade
used
when
the
test
is
given
to
other
types
of
jobs.
justice
potter
stewart
the
training
program
is
greatly
changed.
