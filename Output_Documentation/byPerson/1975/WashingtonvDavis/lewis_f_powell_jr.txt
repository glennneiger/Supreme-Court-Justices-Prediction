justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
you
go
on,
this
suit
was
bought
in
1970
alleging
violations
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
aspect
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
1981,
you
seem
to
be
arguing
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
title
vii
applies,
was
the
complaint
ever
amended?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
evans
before
you
present.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
question
i
asked,
how
did
title
vii
got
into
this
case
and
do
you
think
it
is
properly
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
the
question
there;
let
us
assume
this
way,
an
equal
protection
case
is
nothing
else,
when
will
the
burden
shift?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
you
have
to
prove
under
straight
equal
protection
analysis
is
that
mathematically
more
whites
were
being
--
were
passing
this
test
and
than
blacks?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
not
a
equal
protection
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
your
case
justice
stewart.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
i
am
thinking
about
that,
i
am
thinking
about
sex
discrimination.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
guilty.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
was
an
equal
protection
case.
what
standard
was
applied
in
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
all
one
has
to
show
in
equal
protection
case
is
a
mathematical
impact
that
can
be
construed
discriminatory.
