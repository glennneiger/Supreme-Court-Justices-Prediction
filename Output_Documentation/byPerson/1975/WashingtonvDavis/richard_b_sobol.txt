mr.
richard
b.
sobol
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
start
with
justice
powell’s
inquiry
concerning
the
basis
of
the
suit
and
to
clarify,
one
or
two
misconceptions
that
have
creped
in.
there
was
three
basis
for
this
action
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
which
appears
on
page
24
of
the
appendix.
the
action
was
based
on
fifth
amendment
to
united
states
constitution
in
the
equal
protection
requirements
implicit
therein.
it
was
based
on
section
1981
of
the
title
42
which
as
far
as
i
understand
that
it
is
not
a
procedural
statue
but
is
a
substantive
statute
creating
a
private
right
of
action
against
racial
discrimination
and
employment.
it
is
unlike
1983,
in
that
regard
as
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
for
example
dc
against
carter
make
clear.
third
it
was
based
on
the
district
of
columbia
code
1-320
which
prohibits
racial
discrimination
and
employment
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
there
was
jurisdiction
alleged
for
each
of
these
basis
of
action.
so,
in
essence
the
way
the
case
reaches
the
court,
this
court,
the
issue
is
not
the
bald
issue
of
whether
title
vii
standard
are
the
same
as
constitutional
standards.
it
is
whether
the
composite
of
section
1981
of
title
42.
the
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
and
employment
in
dc
code
and
the
fifth
amendment
together
represent
a
lower
standard,
than
the
title
vii
standard
and
i
would
submit
that
is
not
the
case
that
the
courts
have
treated
1981
as
equivalent
at
the
least
to
title
vii
in
its
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
and
employment.
but
moving
to
the
constitutional
issue,
i
would
say
this
that
the
test
creates
a
classification
between
those
who
pass
it
and
those
who
do
not.
at
the
very
minimum,
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
rational
basis
for
that
classification
and
we
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
question
of
whether
a
classification
is
rational
and
whether
a
test
is
related
to
a
job.
it
is
essentially
the
same
question.
we
do
not
need
in
this
case
to
get
into
the
details
of
the
eeoc
guidelines.
that
is
not
an
issue,
we
simply
say
that
there
is
a
requirement
under
any
of
these
basis
of
authority
that
the
defendants
make
a
showing
at
least
rationality.
rationality
for
the
use
of
an
employment
test
would
mean
that
the
test
has
some
relationship
to
the
job
in
some
respect
and
it
is
our
position
that
their
showing
has
not
been
made
here.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir
for
declaratory
judgment
and
injunction
in
back
pay.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
not
necessarily.
there
is
a
problem
of
simply
amending
to
allege
a
title
vii
action,
because
you
can
not
be
in
court
under
title
vii
unless
you
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
and
get
the
appropriate
action
by
the
administrative
tribunal.
so
it
is
not
a
simple
matter
of
moving
in
the
district
court
to
amend
or
at
least
it
is
a
question
whether
that
is
possible
and
whether
this
case
could
ever
be
turned
into
a
strictly
speaking
title
vii
case,
i
think
is
questionable.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
this
law
is
still
governs.
it
is
a
question
of
another
piece
of
law
also
governs.
the
plaintiffs
brought
this
action
before
title
vii
applied
to
the
district.
it
alleged
three
grounds
of
substantive
right,
those
grounds
are
all
still
fully
applicable
and
they
rely
on
them.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
one
of
them
is
the
constitutional
remedy.
well
the
court
of
appeal
cited
in
its
opinion
the
constitutional
ground
in
1981,
in
footnote
2
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
i
think
it
made
no
distinction
in
the
substantive
standards
mr.
justice
white
and
i
think
it
decided
on
the
grounds
that
were
before
it.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
the
defendants.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
because
the
burden
of
showing
rationale,
your
question
assumes
strictly
a
constitutional
standard,
i
assume.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
is
not
a
title
vii
case
but
it
is
based
on
two
statutes
prohibiting
to
discrimination
and
employment
in
this
circumstance
and
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir.
i
personally
do
not
but
i
think
that
under
any
of
those
standard
having
shown
the
adverse
impact,
the
burden
of
defending
the
practice
as
in
any
constitutional
cases
is
on
the
defendant
of
making
some
showing
of
whatever
the
applicable
standard
is
rationality,
compelling
interest,
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
of
making
not
showing.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
there
is
in
the
nature
of,
there
is
no
authority
in
the
employment
context
in
this
court,
but
in
footnote
35
of
our
brief
on
page
27,
i
have
cited
about
15
cases
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts
that
have
directly
faced
this
very
question
you
are
asking
and
have
concluded
that
the
standards
are
the
same
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
are
the
same,
yes
sir
and
that
this
cases
appear
in
footnote
35
i
have
about
15
different
authorities
in
the
court.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
certainly
not
in
the
employment
context,
my
understanding
of
jefferson
v.
hackney
however
was
that
the
court
ruled
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
make
a
showing
of
a
compelling
interest.
but
that
there
was
an
inquiry
based
on
the
statistics
into
rationality
and
i
have
always
assumed
that
the
burden
of
establishing
rationality
for
classification
falls
on
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
the
case
is,
i
might
be
wrong
on
that
regard,
that
is
my
understanding
that
the
burden
of
showing
rationality
once
the
classification
was
established
is
on
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
but
here
to
wind
up
this
discussion,
whatever
maybe
the
correct
answer
under
the
constitutional
standard
for
the
court
to
make
a
distinction
in
this
case
between
title
vii
standards
and
the
standards
applicable
here,
it
would
have
to
rule
that
direct
prohibition
against
racial
discrimination
and
employment
in
two
federal
statutes
1981
and
that
the
provision
of
the
dc
code
that
i
cited
established
a
different
standard
of
racial
discrimination
and
employment
in
title
vii
and
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
authority
for
that.
the
decisions
applied
in
1981
have
made
no
distinction
between
its
substantive
thrust
and
the
substantive
of
trust
to
title
vii.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
you
must
face
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
both
sources
of
law
and
made
no
distinction
between
them.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think,
a
practice
that
has
uneven
racial
impact
has
to
be
at
the
very
minimum
rational.
although,
there
are
certainly
cases
in
this
court
saying
that
it
has
to
be
more
than
rational
but
without
getting
into
that
because
we
do
not
need
to
get
into
that.
i
think
at
the
very
minimum
there
has
to
be
rationality
to
support
adverse
racial
impact
on
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
yes
i
think
so.
i
think
what
the
court
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
what
is
rational
for
a
test
is
that
the
test
is
related
to
the
job.
i
think
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
different.
in
my
opinion
what
is
irrational
basis
for
the
use
of
an
employment
test
is
that
the
employment
test
assist
the
employer
in
choosing
employees
in
some
positive
way.
that
is
what
i
think
griggs
held,
that
is
what
i
think
the
essence
of
the
guidelines
are.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
it
can
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
either
a
racial
classification
or
a
non
racial
classification.
it
definitely
has
racial
impact,
it
may
not
be
a
racial
classification
but
whether
it
is
or
it
is
not,
rationality
must
be
shown
and
we
do
not
think,
we
need
more
than
rationality
to
prevail.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
the
opinions
of
this
court
do
not
indicate
as
i
read
them
that
a
--
and
i
am
thinking
of
the
california
housing
case
the
name
has
slipped
my
mind
but
do
not
indicate
that
a
practice
having
racial
impact
is
a
racial
classification,
the
indications
as
i
read
them
out
to
the
contrary.
mindful
of
that,
we
have
not
argued
and
have
never
argued
that
there
is
a
racial
classification
in
this
case
which
demands
strict
scrutiny
or
a
compelling
interest.
we
are
content
to
rely
on
the
necessity
that
there
be
a
rational
basis
for
the
use
of
a
test
and
i
think
the
only
rational
basis
for
the
use
of
the
test
is
that
it
does
the
employer
some
good
and
that
that
needs
to
be
proved
and
has
not
been
proved
here.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
verbal
ability
is
an
aspect
of
this
and
almost
any
other
job
in
the
world.
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
proper
test
to
verbal
ability,
i
rely
on
the
necessity
that
there
be
some
showing
more
than
just
a
judge
reading
the
questions
and
saying
this
looks
okay
to
me.
i
do
not
think
that
is
how
these
cases
can
be
decided
anymore
than
griggs
could
be
decided
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
every
title
vii
case
that
i
have
tried
your
honor,
the
defendants
have
brought
in
experts
and
have
attempted
to
prove
that
the
jobs
are
complicated
require
the
filling
out
of
complicated
forms
required
the
use
of
complicated
machinery
for
which
there
are
printed
manuals
that
must
be
understood.
i
have
never
seen
a
case
in
which
any
defendant
has
ever
said
that
the
jobs
in
question
were
not
complicated
and
did
not
require
reading
and
writing
of
complex
material
and
it
is
true
here
too.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
not
for
one
second,
what
i
suggest
is
that
test
21
has
not
been
shown
to
be
a
reliable
indicator
of
whether
those
verbal
skills
in
the
necessary
degree
are
present
or
not
present
and
what
this
court
held
in
griggs
as
that
cannot
be
surmised
but
has
to
be
proved
and
that
is
our
position
here.
that
there
is
a
method
of
proving
job
relatedness
with
which
we
have
no
argument
called
construct
validation,
which
involves
taking
a
trait
such
as
verbal
ability
and
doing
the
appropriate
job
analysis
and
the
appropriate
study
in
rendering
a
report
and
the
civil
service
commission
regulations
accept
then
and
the
eeoc
regulation
accept
that
but
that
has
not
been
done
here.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
a
policeman
has
to
be
able
to
understand
written
material,
speak
and
make
reports
to
the
court
and
make
applications
for
search
warrants.
i
think
it
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
job.
i
have
no
question
about
that.
what
we
do
question
is
whether
there
is
any
indication
that
beyond
the
existing
and
unchallenged
requirement
in
this
case
of
a
high
school
education,
that
this
test
measures
something
which
will
assist
the
display
of
those
skills.
that
is
what
we
see
is
the
question.
we
do
not
dispute
for
one
moment
that
the
requirements
to
be
a
policeman
are
demanding
and
rigorous
and
that
they
should
be
fulfilled.
we
do
not
for
a
one
moment
think
that
the
application
of
the
griggs
test
in
any
context
involves
a
lowering
of
standards.
that
is
not
with
griggs
and
moody
were
about.
there
is
no
effort
by
this
court
to
give
out
jobs
to
those
who
are
not
qualified
for
them.
what
the
court
is
held
is
that
where
there
is
substantial
adverse
impact,
we
are
not
going
to
guess
as
to
whether
the
standard
is
valid
or
valid
but
then
it
raises
a
requirement
to
prove
it
that
it
is
valid.
if
it
is
valid,
if
is
measures
something
important,
it
can
be
used
and
if
it
is
not,
it
cannot
be
used.
i
think
that
is
the—there
is
an
underlying
current
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
that
there
is
something
about
the
griggs
test
which
requires
putting
incompetence
in
jobs
and
i
think
that
is
the
furthest
thing
from
the
truth
that
can
possibly
be.
it
is
simply
a
demand
that
some
proof
be
set
forth
as
to
whether
the
standard
applied
here
test
21
is
predictive
of
the
ability
to
perform
those
verbal
skill
or
not.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
if
there
was.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
if
there
was
proof
that
there
was
a
much
better
one.
that
would
raise
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
less
discriminatory
alternative
as
called
for
this
court's
question
in
my
argument.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
there
would
be
a
less
--
that
is
there
true
but
i
do
think
it
is
required
under
1981
which
i
view
and
i
think
the
courts
have
viewed
as
comparable
to
title
vii,
that
there
be
no
less
discriminatory
alternative.
but
in
this
case
there
is
--
the
defendants
made
no
effort
to
base
their
case
on
proof
of
verbal
ability
being
required
for
policeman’s
job.
the
contention
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes,
an
expert
who
is
confident
to
do
a
validation
study
of
one
of
the
three
types
that
have
been
recognized
by
the
authorities
in
the
field.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
who
comes
to
court
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
on
what
issue?
on
whether
this
test
predicts
the
right
measure
of
verbal
ability?
no,
i
would
not
accept
him
and
the
proof
of
that
is
that
they
are
using
a
cut
off
score
of
40
which
is
completely
arbitrary.
there
is
no
proof
that
it,
rather
than
50
or
30
or
35
or
60
was
the
appropriate
cut
off.
it
was
chosen
at
random.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
how
much
of
the
skill
is
being
measured
and
if
the
test.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
it
is
two
different
inquiries
but
it
goes
to
whether
of
the
test
is
being
validly
used.
if
the
test
being
used
were
the
law
boards
which
also
measures
verbal
ability
and
the
same
passing
requirement
what
was
imposed,
would
say
“yes,
it
is
measuring
verbal
ability,”
but
much
to
much
verbal
ability
and
the
question
is
in
view
of
the
adverse
racial
impact
is
that
is
is
it
justified
to
have
this
additional
unnecessary
requirement.
the
point
here
is
that
verbal
ability
is
required
but
we
do
not
know
how
much
is
required
and
where
test
21
indicates
enough.
perhaps
answering
a
quarter
of
the
questions
on
test
21
would
indicate
sufficient
ability.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
what
more
you
need
is
the
showing
that
the
way
the
test
is
being
used
with
the
cut
off
is
having
some
measurable
impact
on
the
skills
needed
by
a
policeman.
let
me
answer
your
question
further.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
the
first
question
is
whether
it
has
racial
impact
or
we
would
not
be
here
but
going
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
you
have
a
high
school
requirement
to
be
on
the
police
force.
as
far
as
any
of
us
know
that
is
adequate
verbal
ability
to
fill
out
these
reports
and
to
understand
these
cases.
the
question
is
whether
test
21
adds
anything
to
that.
that
is
valid.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
that
is
true,
but
we
do
not
know
whether
it
is
screening
out
people
that
cannot
perform
or
not.
we
have
no
evidence
of
whether
the
people
it
is
screening
out
could
or
could
not
perform
adequately
well
as
policeman.
yes
sir,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no
sir,
they
are
not
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
there
is
nothing
on
that
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes,
that
is
true
and
we
do
not
question
that
the
department
has
a
right
to
give
a
test.
if
it
can
make
a
showing
that
the
test
is
improving
its
selection
processes
but
what
is
failing
here
is
under
any
of
the
alternative
methods
of
making
that
showing
that
have
been
recognized
any
proof
of
that,
and
i
suggest
that
the
questions
that
are
being
asked
are
essentially
raising
the
question
of
whether
we
just
simply
cannot
read
the
test.
whether
the
court
cannot
simply
read
the
test
and
say
yes
it
measures
verbal
ability.
but
if
they
administered
the
cross
word
puzzle
on
the
washington
post
each
morning
to
the
applicants
for
work
on
the
police
force.
that
would
measure
verbal
ability
unquestionably,
and
yet
would
that
be
a
valid
test
and
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
the
same.
its
not
simply
looking
at
the
test
and
saying
this
is
verbal,
this
is
not
verbal.
the
important
part
of
griggs
and
moody
and
oldest
development
of
the
law
in
this
area
is
some
proof
not
surmised
that,
that
is
true,
that
you
have
a
proper
measure
of
validation,
you
have
a
proper
measure
that
this
device
is
assisting
the
employer
in
getting
better
policeman
or
better
employees
what
ever
the
case
maybe.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
i
think
the
court
is
faced
with
the
decision
that
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
all
of
the
ground
on
which
is
decision
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
and
what
and
the
lesser
stand
its?
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes,
it
did
consider
title
vii.
it
is
said
as
much
in
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
cited
some
cases
saying
that
where
there
is
a
change
in
federal
statutory
law
during
the
course
of
litigation.
that
change
should
be
applied
depending
litigation
and
that
is
cited
in
the
court’s
opinion.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
believe
the
court’s
opinion
can
be
read
as
specifying
which
of
these
grounds
it
is
relying
on.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes,
it
is
the
end
of
footnote
ii
on
page
2
(a)
and
i
personally
have
some
problem.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
in
view
of
that,
what
judge
robinson
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
what
judge
robinson
was
doing
was
saying
the
title
vii
is
applicable
as
well
of
the
other
basis
of
authority.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
his
opinion
he
recited
the
basis
on
which
this
ground
--
i
said
that
what
i
meant
is
that
in
his
opinion
he
recited
that
the
complaint
was
based
on
the
constitutional
ground
on
1981
and
then
he
made
this
additional
statement
which
justice
brennan
just
read
holding
that
the
title
vii
standards
were
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
well,
my
trouble
honestly
with
that
proposition
is
the
procedural
requirements
to
get
in
the
court
under
title
vii,
and
this
case
has
not
met
them.
so
it
raises
the
question,
--
in
order
to
make
determination
as
to
whether
this
statement
of
judge
robinsons
is
correct,
it
requires
of
this
court
to
make
a
determination
as
to
given
the
circumstances
of
pending
litigation
and
in
fact
in
this
case
they
were
prior
administrative
proceedings
whether
the
court
would
dispense
in
this
context
with
the
exhaustion
requirements
of
title
vii
and
consider
this
a
title
vii
case.
as
i
think
it
surely
would
be
if
they
were
no
exhaustion
requirements
under
title
vii.
i
think
then
the
authority
cited
by
judge
robinson
would
squarely
on
point.
the
only
wrinkle
is
that
there
was
no
charge,
there
was
no
final
agency
action
and
there
was
no
resort
to
court
filing
that.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes,
i
believe
that
issues
concern
federal
employees
and
not
district
of
columbia
employees
and
that
issue
would
not
be
involved.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
oh,
you
have
to
tell
what
you
perceive
to
be
the
difference
because
i
cannot
see
one.
it
is
a
prohibition
against
discrimination
in
district
of
columbia
government
employment.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
neither
1981
nor
title
vii
is
limited
government
employment
but
the
standard
no
racial
discrimination
and
employment
seems
to
me
that
be
identical
to
1981
and
title
vii
and
judge
robinson,
it
is
seems
to
me
both
made
this
comment
about
title
vii
being
applicable
and
treated
the
standards
as
the
same
as
has
every
court,
every
lower
court
that
has
reached
this
question.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
in
the
statutory
standard
because
it
is
the
statute
which
specifically
addresses
this
problem
as
does
title
vii
and
i
would
be
hard
put
to
think
of
any
basis
for
distinguishing
the
dc
code
provision
and
1981
provision.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
exactly.
now,
i
would
like
to
briefly
point
out
some
other
issues
that
have
been
made
on
the
adverse
impact
very
briefly.
we
think
this
is
one
of
the
clearest
showings
of
adverse
impact
of
any
case
that
has
been
litigated.
there
is
twice
the
pass
rate
of
whites
over
blacks
on
the
test
and
more
important
than
that
because
there
have
been
indications
that
this
were
not
true.
that
2:1
ratio
is
exactly
reflected
in
the
higher
rate.
so
87%
of
the
whites
and
43%
of
the
blacks
pass
and
33%
of
the
whites
and
17%
of
the
blacks
are
hired
so
there
is
no
wash
out
phenomenon
here.
the
impact
of
the
test
is
fully
reflected
in
the
hiring
decision.
now—
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
exactly,
because
the
issue
is
the
legality
of
the
test.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
can
hardly
say,
it
would
be
just
the
reverse,
there
is
about
1½
percentage
point
different
in
the
rate
of
hires.
the
black
rate
of
hire
is
39.8%,
the
white
rate
of
hire
is
37.9%.
it
is
extremely
closed
and
fully
explained
by
the
national
recruitment
effort
where
in
1970
and
1971
that
department
went
all
over
the
country.
got
applications
from
an
88%
white
group
and
naturally
most
of
those
who
applied
did
not
come
to
work
in
the
district
because
that
was
far
from
their
home.
but
although
there
is
very
slight
difference,
i
think
it
is
essentially
equivalent
and
what
it
shows
is
that
the
practice,
the
discriminatory
practice
is
what
is
being
challenged
and
that
is
test
21.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
alright.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
an
application
decides.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
my
understanding
mr.
justice
stewart
if
an
applicant
is
asked
if
he
graduated
in
high
school
and
if
he
says
“no,”
he
is
not
given
an
application.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
not
an
application.
that
these
figures
on
the
record
are
for
high
school
graduates
who
completed
an
application
satisfying
the
high
school
education
requirement.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
would
not
be
accepted,
would
not
be
administered
the
test.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
is
not
in
the
record,
i
know
from
extra
record
material
that
the
answers
i
am
giving
you
are
correct.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
specifically
on
the
question
you
are
asking.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
not
the
mental
examination
and
not
the
physical
examination.
my
understanding
of
chronology
is
that
comes
after
passing
the
test.
only
test
passers
are
given
a
physical
examination
and
a
mental
psychiatric
examination.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
an
applicant
walks
in,
indicates
whether
or
not
he
meets
this
minimal
age
and
education
requirements
and
it
is
on
the
spot
that
day
administered
a
test,
which
is
scored
then.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
he
has
administered
the
test,
right
then
and
there.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir,
it
is
scored,
right
then
and
there.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
by
the
examiner,
by
the
police
officer
in
charge
of
this
function
and
it
is
scored
right
then
and
there.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
everything
i
am
saying
is
not
in
the
record
but
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
i
do
not
question
that
it
is
important
which
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
87.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
43.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no.
they
then
have
a
character
investigation
and
a
psychiatric
investigation.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
are
physical.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
43,
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
they
have
these
three
requirements
to
meet,
the
physical
character
and
mental.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
if
they
pass,
at
least
at
time
this
record
was
compiled
they
were
offered
a
job.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
now,
at
point
the
job
was
offered,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
are
no
figures
in
the
record.
what
we
have
is
acceptances
of
offers
to
which
to
which
those
who
were
hired
and
went
to
training
school
and
the
figures
i
gave
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
39%
of
the
blacks
and
37%
of
the
whites,
and
rounding
it
off
were
hired.
went
through
the
--
i
am
talking
about
those
who
passed
now,
those
who
passed.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
is
approximately
the
same.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
see
a
psychiatrist
and
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no,
it
is
psychological.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right
and
the
exact
figures
out
of
every
hundred
whites
that
applied
33
were
hired
out
of
every
hundred
blacks
that
were
applied,
17
were
hired.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
now
i
would
like
to
briefly.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
do
not
have
that
case,
i
know
that
case
is
coming.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
it
depends
how
the
opinion
in
this
case
is
written.
if
the
opinion
is
written
that
there
are
statutory
bases
for
the
claim
here.
therefore,
there
is
occasion
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
then
it
will
not
bear
on
that
case
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
is
the
most
appropriate
basis
of
deciding
this
case,
given
the
court's
normal
rule
about
constitutional
decisions,
there
are
plainly
statutory
basis
for
the
relief
here,
with
or
without
the
title
vii
component
and
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
basis
on
which
the
case
was
decided
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no.
certainly
not.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
right,
right.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
no,
the
closest
thing
on
the
record,
on
the
questions
you
are
asking
is
that
it
has
been
this
way
for
25
years
and
that
it
is
supposed
to
indicate
a
level
of
proficiency
equal
to
a
high
school
education,
or
high
school
graduation.
that
is
all
that
is
in
the
record
answer
to
your
question.
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
get
to
a
point
that
really
has
not
been
discussed
and
that
is
the
issue
of
whether
there
has
been
a
validation
study
here
which
has
indicated
that
test
21
is
validated
against
success
in
training.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
the
question
of
whether
training
is
an
appropriate
criterion
for
the
validation
of
a
test,
and
it
is
very
clear
from
its
opinion,
it
did
not.
i
stress
that
because
there
seems
to
be
an
invitation
tendered
by
the
amici,
if
no
else
for
the
court
to
decide
broad
questions
of
whether
test
can
be
validated
against
training.
the
court
found
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
i
am
referring
the
footnote
59
on
page
16
(a)
and
17
(a),
that
there
was
no
showing
that
test
21
predicted
success
in
training
and
we
think
that
holding
is
correct
and
that
the
abstract
question
of
whether
training
is
a
proper
criterion
should
not
be
reached
and
very
briefly,
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
held,
i
think
correctly
that
there
was
no
such
showing,
is
that
there
had
been,
there
is
no
proof
that
--
let
me
put
it
differently.
success
in
training
is
a
successful
completion
of
recruit
school.
that
is
the
only
measure
of
success
in
training
which
has
ever
been
used.
every
recruit
passed
recruit
school.
now
the
department
essentially
asked
the
court
to
assume
that
persons
who
did
not
achieve
a
score
of
40
on
test
21
could
not
pass
recruit
school.
but
if
the
cut
off
was
score
was
45
or
50,
the
proof
in
this
case
would
be
identical
and
the
proof
i
referred
to
was
there
be
correlation
between
a
level
of
passing
score
in
test
21
and
the
level
of
passing
score
in
recruit
school
and
the
same
argument
could
then
be
made
that
anyone
who
did
not
get
a
50
could
not
pass
recruit
school
and
of
course
we
have
a
record
here
where
thousands
upon
thousands
got
between
40
and
50
and
went
on
to
recruit
school
and
succeeded.
there
is
no
different
between
the
hypothetical,
i
put
and
the
facts
here,
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
for
assuming
that
a
person
who
scored
35
on
this
test
could
not
succeed
in
recruit
school
and
succeed
as
a
policeman
and
the
defendants
expert
frutransky,
the
one
recommendation
he
made
was
that
the
cut
off
score
was
too
high,
that
he
demanded
more
than
what
was
necessary
to
predict
success
in
recruit
school.
he
recommended
it
to
be
lower
but
of
course
that
the
point
he
chose,
he
had
no
basis
for
either,
and
the
authorities
who
have
indicated
in
our
brief
do
indicate
that
there
ought
to
be
a
study
of
this
question
of
where
on
the
scale
between
0
and
80
on
test
21,
is
there
some
indication
that
this
is
the
proper
measure
and
not
an
excessive
measure
of
the
verbal
ability
needed
to
perform
the
task
of
a
policeman.
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
we
think
there
is
plenty
of
room
on
remand
pursuing
to
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
to
explore
any
issues
of
later
developments
in
this
case.
one
thing
which
is
crucial
later
development
is
that
the
defense
is
moot
and
that,
they
do
not
use
these
recruit
school
tests
that
the
affidavits
put
in
by
the
defendants
make
perfectly
clear,
in
1972
the
whole
system
of
written
test
in
recruit
school
was
abandoned
and
chief
justice
--
i
am
really
confused.
chief
murray
said
in
his
affidavit
that
because
there
was
a
change
in
recruit
school,
he
had
no
basis
for
making
any
judgment
as
to
whether
test
21
was
valid
as
against
the
current
training
procedures.
now
that
is
a
very
important
question
in
the
case,
since
the
whole
defense
is
based
on
correlation
with
an
exam
that
was
abandoned
four
years
ago
and
it
is
not
now
used.
but
my
point
--
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
said
it
is
not
clear
on
this
record
whether
there
should
be
an
injunction
or
a
declaration
because
of
the
circumstances
that
are
now
current
were
not
explored.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
as
of
1971,
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
in
existence
then,
in
the
training
program
in
existence
then,
test
21
used
was
unlawful.
judge
robinson
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
explore
what
other
circumstances
bear
on
the
propriety
of
the
showing
an
injunction
or
not
issuing
an
injunction.
my
point
is
that
in
affirmance
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
decision
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter.
it
is
simply
an
end
of
the
frutransky
study
and
an
end
of
the
issue
of
whether
as
off
1971,
the
department
had
shown
the
test
was
valid.
anything
later
that
comes
in
is
open
to
exploration
on
remand
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
sobol
yes.
that
is
my
view,
that
is
the
defendants
view,
sgs
view
and
the
view
of
all
amici
in
the
case.
this
is
very
important
question
as
far
as
testing
is
concerned
that
judgments
not
be
made
on
the
face
of
the
test.
that
there
be
some
indication
beyond
the
appearance
of
the
matter
that
the
test
is
doing
the
job
it
is
intended
to
do
particularly
in
the
face
of
enormous
adverse
racial
impact.
the
question
is
whether
this
impact
can
be
justified
and
it
has
to
be
justified
in
my
opinion
by
more
that
just
examination
of
the
face
of
the
test.
thank
you.
