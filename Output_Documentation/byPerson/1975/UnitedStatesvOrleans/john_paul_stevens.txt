justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
read
the
complaint
as
predicating
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
driver,
but
rather
on
the
supervision
of
the
outing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
regulations
that
require
these
organizations
to
carry
liability
insurance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
question
i
would
like
to
ask
you
if
i
may.
if
i
understand
your
theory
correctly,
this
organization
would
not
have
sovereign
immunity,
the
wcteo?
it
could
be
sued
directly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
thinking
of
the
impact
of
a
judgment
against
this
organization
if
it
is
entirely
funded
by
the
united
states,
i
suppose
ultimately
the
judgment
will
be
paid
by
the
untied
states,
if
it
were
to
be
paid
at
all,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
theory
of
this
complaint,
the
suit
would
go
against
the
corporation,
would
it
not?
assuming
they
have
named
a
different
defendant,
to
the
untied
states.
if
your
theory
is
correct,
what
you
are
saying
is,
what
the
point
they
should
have
done
is
sued
the
corporation
as
a
corporate
entity,
is
that
not
what
your
position
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
that
(voice
overlap)
was
committed,
that
no
one
is
responsible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
was
committed
by
the
corporate
entity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice

corporation?
