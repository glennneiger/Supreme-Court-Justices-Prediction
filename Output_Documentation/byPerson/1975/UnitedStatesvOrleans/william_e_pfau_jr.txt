mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1964,
the
administration
in
congress
declared
war
on
poverty
in
the
united
sates.
the
economic
opportunity
act
was
at
that
time
enacted.
the
economic
opportunity
act
was
an
ambitious
program
which
included,
among
other
programs,
the
community
action
program.
this
was
a
particularly
unique
approach
that
congress
was
taking
in
its
war
on
poverty
to
try
to
get
to
the
impoverish
people
on
a
local
level.
they
set
up
guidelines
in
the
statute
for
the
setting
up
of
such
a
community
action
program.
they
set
up
also
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
of
government,
a
federal
agency.
this
an
exhibit
in
the
case,
shows
some
of
the
suggestions
necessary
for
organizing
a
community
action
agency.
a
community
action
agency
which
uniquely,
must
be
uniquely
constituted
and
by
the
creation
of
this
definition,
congress
caused
this
community
action
agencies
to
be
set
up
through
out
the
country.
the
major
basic
difference
with
community
action
agency
and
the
ordinary
charitable
agency
in
its
constitution
was
that
it
was
required
to
be
governed
by
a
board
made
up
of
one-third
local
public
officials,
one-third
representatives
of
the
poor
to
be
served,
democratically
elected
and
one-third
representatives
of
the
community.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
public
officials
were
either
the
chief
public
official
in
the
community
are
his
appointee
and
then
certain
other
public
officials
selected
by
him.
a
complex
process
that
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
warren
in
this
instance
and
the
county
commissioner,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
this
corporation,
as
the
affidavits
filed
by
the
respondent
show
and
especially
that
of
mr.
brekcenwich
(ph)
who
was
at
the
outset,
one
of
the
founders
and
was
an
attorney
who
helped
in
the
setting
up
of
the
corporation.
this
corporation
was
created
and
set
up
for
the
sole
and
special
purpose
of
qualifying
as
a
community
action
agency.
the
charter
specifically
provided
and
followed
the
numerous
guidelines
for
setting
up
community
action
agency,
as
to
the
board
the
by-laws
and
so
forth
and
it
was
set
up
in
just
that
fashion,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
well,
that
i
do
not
know
other
than
to
say
that
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
a
copy
of
the
charter
is
filed.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
attached
to
the
affidavit
which
we
filed
of
mr.
william
mcclain
who
was
then
city
solicitor
for
the
city
of
warren.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would.
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
enough
much
detail.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
now,
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
it
be
recognized
that
this
was
not
a
local
agency
in
any
ordinary
sense
of
the
word.
this
was
a
local
agency
set
up
to
act
as
an
agency
of
congress,
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
by
petitioner
that
instead
of
being
a
corporation
acting
primarily
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
this
agency
was
a
contractor
with
the
united
states.
the
solicitor
general
indicates
that
you
should
look
to
the
act
to
interpret
this
situation.
section
2795
of
the
economic
opportunity
act,
clearly
makes
a
distinction
between
grantees
and
contractors.
the
affidavit
of
wendell
verduin
does
not
say
that
this
organization
was
a
contractor,
but
rather
that
it
was
a
grantee.
there
are
federal
regulations,
provisions
about
80
some
pages
of
them
applying
to
these
community
action
agencies
and
code
of
federal
regulation
number
1026
distinguishes
between
contractors
and
grantees.
contractors
must
bid
for
the
contracts
and
so
forth.
this
clearly
is
not
under
the
definitions
in
the
act
and
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
a
contractor
with
the
government
as
has
been
the
major
contention
of
the
government.
furthermore,
contract
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
not
necessarily,
but
there
has
not
been
any
real
contention
that
it
was
not
prior
to
this
and
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
would
indicate
that
this
was
a
corporation
acting
primarily
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
untied
states.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
contractor
is
an
exception
and
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
in
the
logue
case,
at
the
very
outset
of
the
case,
there
was
in
that
case
a
contract.
there
is
no
contract
in
any
ordinary
sense
here
under
the
common
law.
a
contract
under
the
common
law
is
most
simply
defined
in
american
jurisprudence
2d
is
a
legally
enforceable
promise.
this
promise
was
not
legally
enforceable.
the
code
of
federal
regulations
provides
that
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
could
unilaterally
and
peremptorily
terminate
assistance.
they
do
not
save
reach
the
contractor
in
the
contract,
terminate
assistance
to
any
community
action
and
agency
and
from
that
termination,
the
ultimate
appeal
was
to
the
director
of
the
agency
itself.
so
that
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
there
was
no
contract.
now,
the
question
is,
was
this
a
corporation
acting
primarily
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
untied
states.
the
congress
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
had
various
considerations,
various
language
which
the
considered
which
would
have
limited
that
portion
of
the
act,
corporations
acting
primarily
as
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
to
federal
corporations
and
that
sort
of
thing
as
suggested
by
mr.
sachse.
they
decided
not
to
so
limit
it
and
left
the
language
unlimited.
now,
in
this
case,
you
have
a
corporation
which
was
enacted
for
the
--
was
created
for
the
sole
purpose
of
getting
federal
funds,
and
never
received
a
dollar
from
anyone
else.
the
only
other
contributions
it
received
were
in-kind
services
and
it
might
be
noted
at
this
point,
the
deposition
of
mrs.
ellen
stanton
who
was
the
person
employed
by
the
westlawn
neighborhood
center
in-charge
of
this
outing.
in
that
deposition
she
said
that
the
driver
of
the
car
filed
what
they
call
an
in-kind
slip,
in
other
words,
he
was
acting
as
an
employee
of
the
particular
agency
at
the
time
of
this
accident.
that
really
is
not
an
issue
here,
but
the
questions
of
the
court
have
put
it
to
some
extent
an
issue
and
mr.
sachse’s
comment
that
he
was
not
an
employee
is
i
believe
not
correct.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
this
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
in
this
instance
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
perhaps
i
do
not
understand.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
what
he
has
is
this,
your
honor.
he
signed
a
slip
which
was
filed
with
the
agency,
indicating
that
he
was
acting
as
an
employee
and
rendering
an
in-kind
service
to
the
warren-trumbull
council.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
[laughter]
well,
i
do
not
--
that
might
well
be.
the
record
is
silent
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
correct.
there
is
an
80/20
set
up
on
these
corporations,
80%
of
the
funding
is
to
be
in
cash
from
the
united
states.
the
other
20%
is
supposed
to
be
locally
furnished.
i
think
it
is
in
part
a
fiction,
but
they
do
keep
track
of
any
employment
activity
that
any
one
does
on
behalf
of
the
agency
and
file
in-kind
service
slips,
in
other
words
and
then
they
put
on
those
in-kind
service
slips,
they
attached
a
value
and
in
the
report
to
the
office
of
economic
opportunity,
those
are
given
a
dollar
value
to
make
up
this
20%.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
well,
in
this
instance
there
were
two
buses
which
would
be
used.
one
of
the
buses
was
not
available.
two
buses
owned
by
the
agency.
one
of
the
buses
was
not
available
so
two
cars
were
used
in
this
fashion
and
the
man
in
effect
made
a
donation
of
his
services
to
the
agency,
in
other
words,
he
volunteered
to
act
as
an
employee
of
the
agency
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
that
is
true,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
excludes
the
possibility
of
this
man
being
an
employee.
at
any
rate
that
is
not
the
question
now
before
the
court.
that
is
a
question
that
might
require
factual
determination
ultimately
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
record
is
silent
on
that,
your
honor.
for
your
honor’s
information,
the
driver
of
the
automobile
had
$12,500.00
in
insurance
coverage
and
the
covenant
not
to
sue
was
taken
in
that
respect.
that
hardly
being
adequate
compensation
for
the
loss
of
a
young
man’s
right
arm
at
the
shoulder.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
if
there
were
such
factual
basis,
yes.
yes,
assuming
that,
surely,
it
would
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
under
the
ohio
law,
of
course
there
is
a
substantive
risk
of
that
sort
thing,
but
absent
that,
the
agency,
it
is
our
position
that
the
activities
of
the
warren-trumbull
council
are
just
as
much
activities
of
the
united
states
as
activities
of
the
office
of
the
economic
opportunity
or
any
other
federal
agency
that
it
is
within
the
definition
a
federal
agency.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes.
of
course,
the
agency
might
hire
independent
buses,
greyhound
or
something
like
that,
charter
them
and
there
would
be
no
such
responsibility,
but
as
long
as
they
are
being
operated
by
employees
of
the
agency
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position
and
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
it
is
our
position,
your
honor
that
the
agency
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
they
told
him
when
to
leave,
what
route
to
follow.
they
had
the
same
control
as
any
other
federal
agency
sponsoring
an
outing.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
correct,
not
to
take
his
services
to
have
some
else
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
[laughter]
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
well,
that
i
respectfully
submit
is
not
an
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
tort
act
says
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
tort
act
says
that
employees
of
a
federal
agency
are
employees
of
the
united
states
and
the
issue
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
none
of
the
others
were
hurt.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
they
do
not
have
that
protection
--
these
agencies
were
set
up
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
immensely
controlled
by
federal
guidelines.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
day-to-day
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
alright.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i
may
read
from
its
opinion,
the
portion
that
was
not
read
by
mr.
sachse,
he
did
not
read
this
portion,
“on
the
underhand
by
withholding
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
oh!
i
am
sorry.
12
(a)
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
moreover,
the
requirements
imposed
on
his
local
agencies
by
statute
and
regulations
are
not
concerned
with
the
details
of
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
agencies
or
the
programs
which
they
carry
on
in
the
warren-trumbull
county
area.
they
are
more
in
the
nature
general
instructions
to
be
followed
in
order
to
assure
that
certain
policies
which
congress
have
adapted
in
establishing
oeo
are
respected
and
adhered
to.
on
the
other
hand,
by
withholding
approval
of
its
operations,
oeo
had
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
put
wtceo
out
of
business
for
a
period
of
time
and
had
in
october,
1972
selected
a
new
chairman
of
its
board
who
completely
reorganized
the
agency.
these
are
not
powers
usually
possessed
by
a
principal
in
dealing
with
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
correct
and
if
there
is
a
contract,
you
have
a
right
of
action
to
claim
that
you
did
do
thus
and
so
in
substance.
now,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
that
was
a
point
made
by
the
district
court.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
and
the
mayor
of
warren
or
john
jones
or
anyone
else,
if
he
were
acting
on
behalf
of
the
warren-trumbull
council
was
in
our
contention
a
temporary
perhaps
employee
of
the
untied
states
government
and
the
federal
tort
claims
act
specifically
provides
that
though
the
employee
be
only
temporary,
if
he
is
on
an
activity
of
the
untied
states
government,
he
is
an
employee
of
the
united
states
and
covered
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
yes,
your
honor.
the
mayor
could
very
readily
wear
two
hats
as
corporate
president
and
many
people
that
work
for
more
than
one
person
on
different
occasions.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
members
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
cannot
be
employees
to
prevent
political
interference
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
employees,
we
believe
that
this
activity,
the
warren-trumbull
council
of
the
oeo
was
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states
and
if
so,
that
makes
this
difference.
if
it
is
a
corporation,
acting
primarily
as
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states,
it
would
be
assumed
that
that
corporation
would
control
largely
the
day-to-day
activities
of
its
employees.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
act
to
corporations
of
the
nature
pointed
out
by
mr.
sachse
and
the
congress
specifically
considered
limiting
the
act
to
such
corporations
and
thought
not
to
do
so.
now,
if
the
effects
of
this
case
are
looked
at,
you
will
see
this
corporation
is
acting
on
a
local
basis
as
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
it
is
acting
primarily
for
the
united
states.
it
is
in
effect
one
of
the
platoons
that
is
enlisted
by
congress
to
carry
on
the
war
on
poverty.
they
chose
to
set
it
up
in
this
fashion.
it
was
the
congressional
act
that
established
this.
in
addition
to
this,
they
have
all
encompassing
regulations
that
make
this
appear
to
be
a
federal
agency.
for
instance,
their
books
and
records
must
at
all
times
be
available
and
open
to
the
public.
all
of
their
meetings
must
not
only
be
open
to
the
public,
but
any
member
of
the
public
must
recognized
and
heard.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
no,
there
is
not,
your
honor.
there
is
not
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
job
core
members
were
specifically
recognized
by
congress
to
be
covered
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
it
is
significant
that
job
core
was
set
up
in
the
same
economic
opportunity
act
and
that
its
members
were
to
be
recognized
as
covered
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act
because
the
job
core
members
of
course
are
not
corporations.
they
are
individuals
and
furthermore
it
was
contemplated
that
the
members
of
the
job
core
might
be
working
in
all
sorts
of
different
activities,
notwithstanding
that.
that
activity,
the
congress
specifically
said,
those
persons
who
would
not
be
covered
with
the
corporation
provision
were
to
be
members
of
the
untied
states
for
federal
tort
claims
purposes.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
from
the
construction
of
the
statute,
it
would
appear
that
organizations
not
contractors
with
the
untied
states
were
to
be
covered
in
the
intent
of
congress
by
that
provision.
certainly
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
it
did
so
explicitly
with
job
core
members
because
it
might
otherwise,
they
would
be
considered
loaned
servants
or
that
sort
of
thing
on
loan
to
various
industries
that
they
might
be
working
at
and
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
job
core,
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
the
job
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
rather
remarkably
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
well,
the
job
core
members
were
appointed
directly
by
the
office
of
economic
opportunity.
the
rather
remarkable
thing
is
this
phrase
“primarily
acting
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
sates”
has
never
come
for
consideration
by
this
court
before.
it
would
appear
that
that
is
a
language
that
should
be
given
its
plain
meaning.
instrumentality
is
defined
by
webster
as
a
quality
of
state
of
serving
as
a
means
or
intermediary
determining
or
leading
to
a
particular
result,
something
by
which
an
end
is
achieved,
something
that
serves
as
an
intermediary
or
agent
through
which
one
or
more
functions
of
a
controlling
force
are
carried
out.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
astonishingly,
there
have
not
been.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
astonishingly,
your
honor
there
have
not
been.
there
have
been
a
few
cases
where
that
phrase
has
been
used,
but
the
cases
have
not
come
to
grips
with
saying
what
is
--
how
is
this
to
be
defined.
the
court
says
it
is
an
instrumentality.
it
is
not,
but
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
law
edition
3rd
annotation
covering
this
entire
subject
and
the
cases
are
unbelievably
absent
in
any
real
coming
to
grips
with
that
term.
no
court
is
said
what
an
instrumentality
should
be
for
instance,
that
it
should
not
be,
have
its
plain,
be
given
its
plain
meaning.
given
that
plain
meaning,
it
seems
clear
that
this
corporation
was
an
instrumentality
and
these
corporations
which
were
raised
were
instrumentalities.
even
if
they
were
not,
a
significant
case
was
decided.
in
cannon
against
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
blackmun
wrote
the
opinion
and
outlined
independent
contractor
relationship.
in
that
case,
the
federal
cartridge
corporation
had
a
contract
to
maintain
an
arsenal
and
there
was
not
any
question
in
that
case,
but
there
was
a
contract.
nevertheless,
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
the
contract,
the
court
considered
the
amount
of
control
that
was
exercised.
in
that
case,
respondent
respectfully
submits,
had
there
been
the
same
control
over
the
federal
cartridge
corporation
as
there
was
over
this
community
action
agency,
had
there
been
as
there
is
here
some
10
or
15
page
(inaudible)
of
guideline
and
instructions
which
are
on
file
with
the
court,
a
yellow
stack
this
high,
had
there
been
80
or
90
pages
of
federal
regulations
and
30
or
40
pages
of
statute
controlling
just
how
everything
should
be
controlling
not
only
from
the
governing
board.
suppose
in
logue,
the
federal
statute
for
qualifying
non-federal
prisoners
--
to
house
federal
prisoners
required
that
the
county
or
the
state
have
on
its
governing
board
one-third
representatives
of
the
prisoners
to
be
in
logue
that
they
required
the
records
to
be
public
that
anyone
to
be
allowed
to
hear.
is
that
not
in
essence
a
public
sounding
corporation
when
you
have
to
have
all
of
those
elements
to
qualify?
now
here
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
that
is
perhaps
true.
i
do
not
know.
in
addition,
the
actual
control
that
was
exercised
here
has
even
broader,
the
counsel
suggested
the
board
of
directors,
the
governing
board
discharged
mr.
peterman,
not
so.
mr.
peterman’s
deposition
--
the
board
in
question,
the
board
was
dissolved?
yes.
when
was
it?
the
board
was
dissolved
on
august
14
and
the
communication
we
have
received
from
the
regional
office
which
notified
us
as
of
that
date,
that
board
was
no
longer
considered
a
functional
board.
and
who
dissolved
it?
the
regional
office.
the
question;
in
chicago?
yes
sir.
so
the
board
was
discharged
and
dissolved
and
subsequently
dr.
sidney
roberts,
a
young’s
town
university
professor
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
they
simply
did
it.
they
wrote
to
them
and
they
said
--
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
they
wrote
and
said
your
board
of
governing
--
this
what
they
did.
maybe
they
did
not
have
the
power
to
do
it,
but
they
did
it
and
that
was
the
power
they
took
upon
themselves.
mr.
william
e.
pfau,
jr.
perhaps
the
court
must
inquire,
but
it
is
the
fact
as
to
how
this
agency,
this
particular
agency
was
run
and
governed
that
is
controlling
in
this
particular
case
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
have
established
here
by
these
affidavits
and
depositions
that
this
was
a
corporation,
acting
primarily,
actually
exclusively
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
