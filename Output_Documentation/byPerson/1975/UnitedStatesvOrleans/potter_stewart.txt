in

it

what
about

justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
oeo
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
not
the
respondeat
superior
theory,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
your
answer
to
my
brother
stevens
is
correct,
the
theory
of
the
complaint
was
not
the
negligence
of
the
driver
as
such,
but
the
negligence
of
warren-trumbull
in
allowing
this
young
man
to
drive
the
car
and
not
more
closely
structuring
and
supervising
the
outing?

the

justice

what

justice

thank
you.
justice

the
job
core
itself
is
not
a
corporation,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
covered
with
by
the
general
language
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
provision
making

--
justice

stewart
--
or
as
your
claim
is
that
your
client
is
a
corporation
and
under
the
general
language
of
the
tort
claims
act,
a
corporation
primarily
acting
as
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
the
job
core
simply
could
not
and
would
not
fit
into
that?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
corporate
entity
were
ensured,
the
defendant
in
this
lawsuit
would
not
be
the
insurance
company,
it
would
be
the
corporate
entity?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
fact
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
he
was
not
insured,
but
that
does
not
detract
from
the
appropriateness
of
the
corporate
entity
being
the
defendant
in
this
lawsuit
and
the
further
fact
is
that
it
is
only
funds
are
funds
that
came
from
the
federal
government?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
told
us
earlier
that
it
was
not,
i
thought
or
implied?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whether
or
not
insured,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
appropriateness
of
the
defendant
in
that
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
before
you
sit
down.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
at
all,
is
there
as
to
whether
the
driver
of
the
car
was
an
employee?
the
question
is
whether
this
community
action
was
a
corporation
primarily
acting
as
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
