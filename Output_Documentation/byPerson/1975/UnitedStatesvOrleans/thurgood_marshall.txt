justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
could
dispute
it.
you
did
not
file
a
contrary
affidavit
in
the
district
court,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
stands
un-contradicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
un-contradicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
be
straight,
the
only
thing
you
have
is
that
one
affidavit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
record
in
this
case,
did
the
government
put
in
anything
other
than
one
affidavit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
is
there
in
the
record
on
behalf
of
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
government
stands
on
whatever
they
can
get
on
the
affidavits,
but
the
government
only
put
in
to
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
man
who
came
down
the
street
and
got
into
the
line
of
cause
would
be
in
the
same
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
this
man
is
an
employee.
what
does
he
have
to
show
that
he
is
an
employee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
apply
too
for
the
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
will
say,
he
could
deduct
it
from
his
income
tax?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
find
that
this
young
man
was
an
employee
rather
than
independent
contractor,
he
just
donates
his
services?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
hold
did
the
federal
government
have
over
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
submit
that
in
other
agency,
if
they
tell
you
to
do
something,
you
do
not
do
it,
you
get
fired.
what
control
do
they
have
over
him,
not
to
take
his
services?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
break
his
heart,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
do
not
see
this
man
volunteered
the
services
and
in
this
later
date,
you
find
that
he
is
an
employee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
tort
act
say
employee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
word?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
all
the
children
that
were
in
that
bus,
would
they
have
any
action
against
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
they
sued?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they
had
been
hurt,
they
would
have
a
right
of
action
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
go
to
everybody
in
that
caravan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say,
they
are
immensely
controlled,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
court
of
appeals
finding
that
they
were
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
day-to-day
is
a
magic
word
in
this
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
magic
series
of
words,
did
not
the
court
hold
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
that
the
principal
usually
if
he
says,
“i
will
give
you
money
providing
you
do
thus
and
so
and
you
agree
to
do
thus
and
so
and
you
stop
doing
thus
and
so,
you
stop
getting
the
money?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
united
states
government
official
dissolved
a
state
corporation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
what
they
said
was
no
more
money?
