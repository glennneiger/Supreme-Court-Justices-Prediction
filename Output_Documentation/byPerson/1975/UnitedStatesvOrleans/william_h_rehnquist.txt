corporate
structure;
is
it
just
an
activity
that
is
conducted
by
warren-trumbull?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
far
as
there
is
any
material
conflict
in
the
affidavit,
the
government
should
have
not
gotten
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court,
i
suppose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
with
reconstruction
finance
corporation
as
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
considered
that
the
driver
of
this
car
was
an
employee
of
the
warren-trumbull
organization?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
warren-trumbull
were
a
federal
agency,
how
could
he
qualify
as
an
employee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
does
not
necessarily
make
it
in
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states
though,
does
it
or
a
corporation
primarily
acting
as
such?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
really
what
you
have
to
prove,
is
it
not,
not
simply
negative
effect
that
it
was
a
contractor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
turns
it
upside
down,
does
it
not?
ordinarily
an
employee
gets
paid
something.
here
you
are
saying
that
he
contributed
something?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you
are
saying
is
not
that
this
fellow
got
paid
something
and
was
therefore
an
employee,
but
that
he
paid
something
and
was
therefore
an
employee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
to
say
you
donate
your
services
does
not
make
you
a
volunteer
to
act
as
an
employee?
ordinarily
an
employee
is
somebody
who
gets
some
benefit
from
his
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
pfau,
is
there
not
a
certain
incongruity
of
mr.
sachse's
right,
that
congress'
basic
intend
and
i
am
talking
about
instrumentality
of
the
united
states'
corporation,
he
says
with
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation,
the
commodities
credit
corporation,
all
kinds
of
national
operations
based
in
washington
and
then
you
say
this
too
is
that
and
it
is
one
of
apparently
800
similar
entities,
each
localize
in
a
small
part
of
one
of
the
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
have
public
corporation,
can
you
not,
without
it
being
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
or
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states?
there
are
many,
i
presume,
public
local
corporations
in
the
state
of
ohio?
