mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
employees
of
the
warren-trumbull
council
for
economic
opportunity
in
warren,
ohio
are
federal
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
that
is
where
the
united
states
may
be
held
liable
for
an
automobile
accident
that
occurred
on
an
outing
sponsored
by
the
westlawn
neighborhood
opportunity
center,
a
program
run
by
warren-trumbull.
the
district
court
granted
the
united
states'
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court,
in
our
view,
incorrectly,
in
contrary
to
this
court’s
decision
and
logue
versus
the
united
states
and
maryland
versus
the
united
states.
the
facts
are
shown
in
affidavits,
exhibits
and
depositions
that
were
filed
with
and
against
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
they
showed
the
following:
warren-trumbull
is
a
nonprofit
ohio
corporation
organized
at
the
instance
of
the
city
of
warren,
ohio
in
1965.
the
charter
of
the
corporation
is
reproduced
at
appendix
32.
its
purpose
is
to
aid
in
eliminating
poverty
in
trumbull
county,
ohio.
to
do
so,
it
may
receive
funds
from
any
source,
but
its
principle
funding
has
always
been
through
grants
from
the
office
of
economic
opportunity.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
is
difficult
to
say
that.
it
has
not
been
its
exclusive
source
of
support
because
20%
of
its
support
has
come
from
donations
and
kind
in
the
community
and
there
may
have
been
some
funding,
but
so
far
as
we
know
the
only
dollar
grants
that
came
to
the
organization
were
from
the
oeo.
to
receive
federal
funds,
warren-trumbull
had
to
satisfy
the
statutory
requirements,
the
economic
opportunity
act.
primary
among
these
were
following;
first,
it
had
to
have
a
board
of
directors
that
was
composed
one-third
of
locally
elected
officials.
one-third
of
members
of
the
business
and
professional
community
that
it
served
and
one-third
of
members
of
the
community
of
the
poor
for
whose
benefit
the
society
was
set
forth,
that
is
required
by
42
u.s.c.
2791
(a).
secondly,
no
employee
of
oeo
could
serve
on
the
board
of
directors
or
on
any
committee
or
administrative
body
of
warren-trumbull.
thirdly,
at
least
20%
of
its
support
had
to
come
from
sources
other
than
federal
funds.
to
receive
federal
funds,
it
also
had
to
obey
statutory
requirements
and
regulations
concerning
the
use
of
those
funds.
for
instance
and
primarily,
the
salary
ranges
that
could
be
paid
to
its
employees
had
to
be
in
accordance
with
comparable
salaries
in
the
communities
and
could
not
exceed
$15,000.00
per
annum
per
employee
from
federal
funds.
employees
of
the
agency
were
prohibited
from
participating
in
unlawful
demonstrations,
i
think
that
would
go
without
saying,
if
they
are
unlawful
demonstrations.
and
thirdly,
warren-trumbull
would
have
to
submit
to
full
auditing
by
the
oeo
to
see
that
the
funds
were
expended
in
accordance
of
the
conditions
of
the
grant.
the
act
also
provided,
the
oeo
act
also
provided
that
the
oeo
could
not
set
national
priorities
for
the
use
of
its
grant
funds
and
that
the
local
board
of
directors
must
have
authority
over
policy
of
hiring
and
firing.
as
the
deposition
of
wendell
verduin,
the
chicago
regional
director
of
oeo
made
clear
and
i
am
quoting
from
deposition
at
page
46,
“the
recruitment
selection,
the
hiring
and
firing
of
staff
members
of
the
community
action
agency
is
done
by
that
board
of
directors
under
its
own
policies
and
procedures.”
and
quoting
from
deposition
of
lester
peterman
(ph),
a
former
executive
director
of
warren-trumbull
who
had
been
fired
by
the
board
of
directors,
it
stated,
“i
received
my
directions
from
my
board
which
is
a
governing
board
not
an
advisory
board.”
one
of
the
programs
of
warren-trumbull
was
the
westlawn
neighborhood
opportunity
center.
i
probably
interrupt
myself
here
to
say
that
there
is
some
865
agencies
of
this
sort
funded
through
oeo
throughout
the
country,
but
one
of
the
programs
of
these
agencies
of
warren-trumbull
was
westlawn
neighborhood
opportunity
center.
it
was
one
of
a
number
of
neighborhood
centers
that
warren-trumbull
ran,
where
among
other
things,
teenage
children
could
come
after
school
and
play
ping-pong
or
the
pool.
it
also
organized
dances
and
outings
and
it
was
on
one
of
these
outings
that
the
respondent
was
hurt.
the
outing
was
to
nearby
lake
whose
name
i
had
intended
to
mention,
but
i
will
not
because
it
seems
to
be
too
difficult
to
pronounce.
it
is
something
in
the
nature
of
cognac.
westlawn
in
the
outing,
used
one
van
that
was
purchased
with
oeo
funds
grant
the
money.
they
also
used
several
cars
owned
by
people
in
the
community.
one
of
the
private
cars
had
a
wreck
on
the
way
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
just
an
activity
conducted
by
warren-trumbull.
one
of
the
private
cars
had
a
wreck
on
the
way
back
from
the
lake.
well,
i
do
not
want
into
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
whether
there
was
negligence
or
what,
there
was
negligence,
it
appears
there
were
too
many
people
in
the
car.
respondent
was
seriously
injured
and
lost
his
right
arm
as
a
result
of
the
accident
because
the
accident
was
driven
a
licensed
driver
and
was
insured.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no
other
entity.
the
suit
was
brought
purely
against
the
united
states.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
oeo
participated
in
hiring
the
personnel
involved
in
this
outing
or
in
planning
the
outing,
that
it
knew
of
the
outing
or
that
it
had
any
control
over
it
at
all.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
was
one
of
the
teenage
students,
a
17-year
old
boy
who
was
going
on
the
outing
and
he
was
using
his
father’s
car
with
the
father’s
permission
to
take
some
of
the
students
on
the
outing.
respondent
brought
suit
against
united
states
for
$1
million
and
the
respondent’s
father
for
a
$100,000.00
additionally,
stating
that
agents
of
the
united
states
were
in-charge
of
the
outing
and
were
negligent.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
the
suit
was
brought
by
the
father
individually
and
on
behalf
of
his
son
against
the
untied
states.
the
owner
of
the
car
was
not
sued.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
united
states
moved
for
a
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
persons
alleged
had
been
negligent
were
not
employees
of
the
united
states.
the
district
court
in
a
written
opinion
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits
and
depositions
held
that
warren-trumbull
was
a
contractor
with
the
united
states
and
not
a
corporation
acting
as
an
instrumentality
or
agency
of
the
united
states.
now
on
rehearing,
an
answer
to
arguments
that
its
activities
were
controlled
by
the
united
states,
the
district
court
held
that
the
warren-trumbull
“still
remains
independent
locally
controlled
and
constituted
non-profit
corporation,
while
the
oeo
has
the
power
to
cut-off
federal
funds,
if
the
counsel
fails
to
meet
federal
standards.”
they
had
no
power
to
cut-off
funds
from
other
sources
which
the
council
is
encouraged
to
utilize.
on
appeal,
and
i
think
this
may
be
the
crux
of
the
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
agreed
with
this,
there
were
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
no
showing
that
oeo
controlled,
this
is
in
our
petition,
an
appendix
to
petition
of
page
12
(a),
there
was
no
showing
that
oeo
controlled
or
supervised
the
physical
performance
of
the
work
of
employees
of
wtceo,
that
is
warren-trumbull,
and
westlawn.
moreover,
the
requirements
imposed
upon
these
local
agencies
by
statute
and
regulations
are
not
concerned
with
the
details
of
the
day-to-day
operation
of
the
agencies
or
the
programs
which
they
carry
on
in
the
warren-trumbull
county
area,
that
is
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
of
course
agreed,
but
the
court
had
said
the
same
thing,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
it
did
not
consider
the
ties
that
warren-trumbull
had
with
the
oeo
to
be
characteristic
of
an
independent
contractor
and
that
it
thought
that
in
reading
the
humanitarian
purpose
of
the
tort
claims
act,
together
with
the
humanitarian
purpose
of
the
oeo,
that
an
accident
that
occurred
to
one
of
the
persons
that
oeo
was
designed
to
help
and
one
of
the
people
on
the
outing
should
be
covered
by
the
tort
claims
act.
the
court
noted
that
if
a
person
who
was
hurt
was
a
stranger
that
the
situation
might
be
handled
by
traditional
principles
of
contractor-employee
relationship
and
the
government
might
not
be
liable.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
sixth
circuit
specifically
declined
to
rule
on
that,
but
said
there
might
not
be.
it
based
its
ruling
on
a
position
that
we
find
no
support
for
in
tort
claims
act
that
whether
there
is
a
tort
claim
or
not
would
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
plaintiff,
on
the
status
of
the
plaintiff.
before
i
leave
the
statement
of
the
case,
i
want
to
add
one
other
thing.
the
respondents
and
the
court
of
appeals
used
as
one
of
their
basis
for
liability,
an
affidavit
by
a
man
named
sidney
roberts,
that
two
years
after
this
accident,
in
october
of
1972,
the
accident
was
in
september
of
1970,
that
he
was
asked
by
oeo
to
be
the
new
chairman
of
the
board
of
warren-trumbull
and
that
he
was
appointed
directly
by
the
chicago
office
of
oeo
to
that
position.
this
is
all
there
is
in
the
record
about
it,
this
statement.
we
have
not
thought
it
appropriate
to
go
beyond
the
record
and
all
we
can
say
on
this
is
that
if
this
man
was
appointed
directly
by
oeo,
it
was
in
a
violation
of
statutes
and
regulations
and
we
do
not
see
how
it
could
have
occurred.
what
it
seems
to
us
obviously
did
occur
if
something
of
this
nature
occurred.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
there
is
no
contrary
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
stands
as
a
statement
that
in
1972,
two
years
after
the
accident,
this
man
was
appointed
by
the
regional
chairman
of
oeo
to
be
director
of
the
board
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
--
of
warren-trumbull.
it
is
un-contradicted
except
as
to
the
legal
conclusion
and
that
this
was
a
direct
appointment
that
it
seems
clear
as
a
legal
matter
that
oeo
could
threaten
to
withhold
funds
unless
a
new
director
of
the
board
was
appointed
and
that
apparently
a
new
director
of
the
board
was
appointed,
all
two
years
after
the
events
at
issue
here.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that
reflects
the
same
thing
that
we
are
saying.
well,
i
suppose
the
answer
is
yes.
perhaps
that
does
conflict
with
the
other
statement.
i
do
not
think,
however,
that
there
is
a
conflict
of
fact
within
these
affidavits
that
requires
resolution
by
this
or
any
other
court
because
i
think
that
whether
or
not
oeo
had
an
influence,
assuming
that
the
board
was
not
in
compliance
with
the
statute
of
getting
a
new
chairman
of
the
board
appointed
before
any
other
grants
were
made,
would
not
affect
the
day-by-day
control
of
activities
such
as
this
one.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
not
sure
to
understand
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
there
is
a
full
affidavit
by
--
there
is
a
full
deposition
by
wendell
verduin,
the
head
of
the
chicago
office
of
oeo
in
which
he
states
very
firmly
that
oeo
did
not
interfere
in
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
there
are
series
of
affidavits.
there
is
affidavit
of
wendell
verduin.
there
is
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
it
was
submitted
by
the
government.
it
was
the
only
affidavit
submitted
by
the
government
as
i
recall.
the
other
affidavits
and
depositions
were
submitted
by
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
government
put
into
one
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
so
far
as
there
is
any
material
conflict
with
the
emphasis
on
material
and
conflict
on
a
point
that
it
would
be
determinative
in
this
case,
but
we
do
not
think
those
points
are
determinative
in
this
case.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
tort
claims
act.
tort
claims
act
28
u.s.c.
1346
(b)
here
and
it
is
quoted
of
course
in
our
brief,
makes
the
united
states
liable
for
wrongful
acts
of
any
employee
of
the
government
while
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
office
or
employment.
employee
of
the
government
is
defined
so
as
to
include
all
true
government
employees,
but
not
to
go
beyond
that.
an
employee
of
the
government,
includes
employees
of
any
federal
agency
under
the
act
and
a
federal
agency
is
defined
as
including
the
executive
departments,
the
military
departments,
independent
establishments
of
the
united
states
and
corporations
acting
primary
as
instrumentalities
or
agencies
of
the
united
states,
but
does
not
include
any
contractor
with
the
united
states.
these
terms
are
not
unclear.
independent
establishments
of
the
united
states
rather
clearly
refers
to
the
independent
regulatory
commissions.
it
makes
clear
that
this
was
not
limited
to
the
pure
executive
branch
which
is
the
word
that
precedes
it.
it
covers
federal
trade
commission,
interstate
commerce
commission
of
that
sort.
it
is
not
strictly
part
of
the
executive
department.
corporations
primarily
acting
as
instrumentalities
of
the
untied
states,
and
remember
this
was
an
act
passed
in
1946.
the
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
was
defined
in
an
earlier
bill
that
led
to
this
act
as
corporations
whose
primary
function
is
to
act
as
agencies
of
the
united
states
whether
or
not
authorized
to
sue
or
be
sued
and
whether
authorized
to
sue
or
be
sued
gives
a
pretty
good
clue
to
what
congress
had
in
mind.
it
had
in
mind
federal
corporations
where
they
were
so
close
that
they
could
not
sue
or
whether
they
were
far
enough
removed
so
they
had
the
authority
to
sue
or
be
sued.
i
want
to
give
you
source
for
this.
it
is
not
in
our
brief.
this
is
from
house
report
number
2245,
77th
congress,
second
session.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
commodities
credit
corporation,
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
there
is
a
whole
list.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
sir?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
the
oeo
itself
i
think
would
just
be
an
executive
agency.
an
oeo
employee
would
be
covered
as
federal
agency.
the
senate
report
number
1399,
79th
congress,
second
session,
page
31
makes
this
equally
clear.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
is
report
1399,
79th
congress,
second
session,
page
31.
this
section
as
referring
to
the
definition
of
section,
“this
section
defines
the
terms
used
in
the
title
and
makes
it
clear
that
its
provisions
cover
all
federal
agencies,
including
government
corporations.”
it
goes
along
with
what
we
have
said
and
it
is
pretty
obvious
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
exclusion
of
contractor
with
the
united
states
also
shows
that
congress
only
intended
to
make
the
united
states
liable
for
the
torts
of
its
employees
or
most
those
within
its
direct
control.
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
under
this
statutory
scheme
that
congress
intended
to
make
united
states
responsible
for
the
torts
of
employees
of
its
grantees
who
typically
would
be
universities,
hospitals,
or
in
later
times,
community
activities
that
the
government
chooses
to
support
with
grant
funding.
their
employees
are
even
further
removed
from
federal
employment
than
are
the
employees
of
a
contractor
because
a
contractor
does
something
specific
for
the
untied
states
in
accordance
with
detailed
plans
and
specifications.
whereas
a
grantee
is
aided
by
federal
money
in
performing
a
general
program
that
the
government
wishes
to
encourage
without
being
in
control
of
it,
even
to
the
extent,
that
it
is
in
control
of
the
performance
of
a
contractor.
in
determining,
whether
employees
of
a
body
receiving
federal
funds
be
a
contractor
or
some
other
body,
whether
those
employees
are
federal
employees
under
the
tort
claims
act,
the
court
has
looked
at
two
primary
sources
and
both
make
great
deal
of
sense,
if
i
may
say
so.
first,
the
statute
that
establishes
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
body
at
issue,
that
is
in
maryland
versus
--
they
did
this
both
in
maryland
and
in
logue,
but
in
maryland
versus
united
states,
the
court
held
that
maryland
national
guard
was
not
a
federal
instrumentality,
even
though
it
received
its
funding
from
the
united
states
and
even
though
its
employees
to
advance
and
to
perform
their
duties
appropriately,
you
had
to
follow
detailed
federal
regulations
and
held
this
both
as
to
the
military
employees
and
to
caretaker
employees
who
are
in
fact
taking
care
of
property
admitted
to
the
federal
property,
but
the
statute
did
not
set
this
up
as
a
federal
agency
in
time
of
peace.
it
set
up
as
a
state
agency.
the
second
test
the
court
has
looked
to
is
the
degree
day-by-day
control
over
the
activities
of
the
employee.
this
is
appropriate
too
because
the
person
who
controls
the
day-by-day
activities
of
employees
is
the
person
who
can
keep
accidents
from
happening
and
is
the
person
that
ought
to
be
responsible
if
an
accident
does
happen.
in
either
test,
this
warren-trumbull
community
program
is
not
a
federal
instrumentality
and
its
employees
are
not
federal
employees.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
he
was
not
paid
for
driving
the
car.
he
was
one
of
the
citizens
who
is
going
on
this
outing
and
who
as
a
favor
to
warren-trumbull,
drove
the
car.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
think
he
could
not.
the
argument
of
course
is
that
he
would
have
been
acting
in
that
capacity
at
that
moment
and
could
be
considered
a
federal
employee.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
agree.
i
think
the
complaint
basically
says
that
the
activity
should
have
been
more
tightly
supervised.
the
economic
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
as
i
understand
it,
the
complaint
does
not
make
that
argument
as
to
the
driver
of
the
car,
but
in
some
of
the
briefs
and
so
forth,
the
argument
is
made
by
the
respondents
that
the
driver
of
the
car
was
acting
for
warren-trumbull
and
that
warren-trumbull
was
a
federal
agency
and
that
therefore
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
that
is
a
theory
of
the
complaint.
now
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
oh!
one
of
the
depositions
of
the
driver
shows
pretty
well
what
happened.
the
number
of
the
kids
came
in
cars
that
their
parents
owned,
driven
by
licensed
drivers,
but
then
some
of
them
wanted
to
stay
late
and
two
cars
stayed
later
than
the
rest
and
then
to
get
the
boys
and
girls
together
in
the
same
car,
eight
of
them
got
into
one
care
and
just
a
few
in
the
other
and
it
was
the
car
with
eight
that
had
the
wreck.
now,
turning
to
the
statute,
the
economic
opportunities
act
makes
it
clear
that
as
i
pointed
out,
i
want
to
move
quickly,
because
i
want
to
save
a
minute
or
so
for
rebuttal
if
i
can,
that
federal
government
can
only
lend
money
to
a
community
agency,
if
it
has
board
of
directors
on
which
no
federal
person
can
sit.
if
the
charter
is
the
state
charter
not
a
federal
charter
and
if
it
has
local
support
and
so
forth,
but
one
of
the
points
that
is
most
persuasive
to
me
is
that
in
the
same
act,
in
setting
up
the
job
core,
the
congress
specially
said
that
the
tort
claims
act
would
apply
to
members
of
the
job
core.
now,
it
is
incredible
to
me
that
congress
would
have
been
tended
the
tort
claims
act
to
apply
to
the
job
core
and
felt
that
it
had
to
say
so,
but
would
have
felt
that
the
community
action
program
where
it
sent
such
pains
to
make
this
--
to
only
allow
money
to
be
given
to
local
programs,
that
there
people
would
be
employees
of
the
government
without
saying
a
word
about
it.
and
also
as
to
the
job
core,
you
will
notice
that
there
is
a
tick
of
which
federal
employment
benefits
will
apply
as
to
the
caa
programs,
there
is
nothing
like
that.
congress
obviously
did
not
intend
these
people
to
be
federal
employees.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
will
say
one
more
thing
and
then
i
will
sit
down
and
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
a
fact
that
there
was
not
the
day-by-day
control
that
would
make
for
a
useful
federal
responsibility
and
the
board
of
directors
of
these
programs
are
blue
ribbon
boards
in
the
sense
that
it
is
local
elected
officials,
local
business
people
and
the
members
of
the
poor
and
that
is
where
the
liability
ought
to
be.
they
should
be
responsible
for
having
proper
insurance.
they
should
be
responsible
for
making
sure
the
activity
is
carried
out
right
and
if
they
do
not
that
they
should
be
personally
liable
for
it
and
that
way
you
can
keep
these
accidents
from
happening,
but
by
putting
responsibility
on
uncle
sugar
in
washington,
it
will
mean
locally
there
is
no
responsibility.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
have
nothing
else
unless
the
court
has
questions.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
would
not
through
the
united
states,
whether
it
is
so
much
as
state
corporation
i
suppose
would
be
a
question
of
local
ohio
law.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
corporation
has
funds
in
its
accounts
and
also
whether
the
suit
was
brought
against
the
corporation
as
a
corporation
or
against
the
individual
directors
who
failed
to
do
what
they
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
not
want
to
put
myself
in
the
position
of
telling
the
plaintiff
what
he
should
do
other
than
(voice
overlap)
united
states.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
it
is
my
position
that
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
these
vehicles
should
be
ensured
and
that
the
corporate
entity
should
be
insured
and
that
if
the
board
of
director--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that
will
be
correct
and
if
the
board
of
directors
had
failed
to
provide
adequate
insurance
then
the
proper
defendant
may
be
the
board
of
directors.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
get
a
little
confused
on
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
we
actually
do
not
know
whether
the
corporate
entity
was
insured.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
not
think
so.
the
vehicles
were
not.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that
is
correct.
