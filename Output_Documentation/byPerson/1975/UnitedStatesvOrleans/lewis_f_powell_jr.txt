justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
is
an
affidavit
from
mr.
wendell
verduin
on
page
9
of
the
appendix.
he
is
the
regional
director
of
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
in
chicago
and
does
he
not
say
that
the
warren-trumbull
and
westlawn
make
their
own
decisions
as
to
whom
to
hire,
discipline,
and
discharge?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
view
that
as
creating
a
conflict?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
board
members
elected?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
this
be
the
mayor
for
example?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
corporation
authorizes
the
chief
executive
office
of
the
city
to
appoint
the
said
members
of
the
board?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
still
curious,
perhaps
it
in
the
record,
but
i
did
not
observe
it.
well,
how
many
members
of
the
board
are
they
and
how
were
they
chosen?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
a
copy
of
the
charter
in
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
that
be
an
answer
to
my
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
will.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
supposing
the
mayor
of
warren
had
been
driving
the
car,
would
the
young
man
injured
have
the
same
cause
of
action
that
you
are
depending
here?
the
mayor
was
one
of
their
directors,
as
the
community
action
agency.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
district
court,
that
is
right.
