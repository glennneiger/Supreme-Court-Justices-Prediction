unknown
speaker
against
whom
no
other
claim
is
pending,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
would
their
clearly
be
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law
in
washington?
unknown
speaker
as
you
look
at
complaint
where
was
a
state
cause
of
action
stated?
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
appendix?
i
could
not
find
it?
unknown
speaker
i
read
this
carefully
and
i
just
could
not
find
a
state
claim
cause
of
action
stated?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
not
any,
why
then
this
question
assertedly
involved
in
this
case
does
not
exist,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
this
maybe
maintained
against
it
but
where
is
any
cause
of
action
stated
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
you
are
entitled
to
go
back
and
file
a
complaint
stating
a
cause
of
action
under
the
state
law
but
i
cannot
find
any
stated
here.
unknown
speaker
the
question
that
you
said
the
court
must
the
preliminary
deal
with
arises
if
and
only
if
a
cause
of
action
is
stated
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
and
i
just
still
have
trouble
seeing
where
if
anywhere
is
one
stated?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
i
noticed
in
paragraph
1
of
your
complaint
on
page
12
of
the
appendix
and
again
in
paragraph
20
on
page
16,
you
say
that
in
as
much
as
the
plaintiff’s
dismissal
was
authorized
by
36.16
of
the
revised
code
of
washington,
that
statute
on
its
face
is
violated
plaintiff’s
rights
on
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
doesn't
that
kind
of
militate
against
your
contention
that
there
was
a
state
law
of
claim.
unknown
speaker
in
the
state
court’s
your
cause
of
action
would
be
a
federal
cause
of
action
because
your
claim
would
be
that
the
state
law
violates
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
stated
here,
at
least
i
cannot
find
it,
i
tell
you,
you
have
not
pointed
it
out.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
sued
of
all
the
parties
that
you
wanted
to
sue
in
the
superior
court
of
spokane
county?
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
gotten
all
the
relief
in
the
washington
state
court
system
and
i
take
it
that
you
could
have
gone
in
the
federal
system?
unknown
speaker
but
of
course
under
judge
neil’s
through
that
ruling,
your
federal
case
would
be
heard
in
federal
court.
it
is
just
your
state
law
claim
that
would
not
be
heard
there.
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
any
difference
in
the
pendent
claim
issue
that
was
passed
on
in
gibbs
and
the
pendent
party
issue
that
is
whether
where
you
already
have
all
the
parties
properly
before
the
federal
court
to
say
will
add
a
claim
by
one
against
the
other
because
there
are
already
existing
federal
claims
against
them
and
the
pendent
party
case
situation
that
you
have
here
or
the
party
is
not
here
in
federal
court
by
virtue
of
any
other
federal
claim,
indeed
by
no
federal
claim
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
party
that
you
are
talking
about
the
deficiency
in
economy
that
party
might
make
some
sense,
if
he
is
already
there
to
say
you
would
also
try
up
some
other
claims
and
rising
out
of
the
same
transaction.
unknown
speaker
the
state
court
described
both
the
federal
and
the
state
claim
together?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
all
you
want
to
talk
about
one
or
two
trials,
there
is
one
place
at
least,
there
is
no
question
but
what
you
can
have
is
just
one
trial.
that
is
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
brought
to
the
state
issued
the
federal
court
independently?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
let
me
just
get
me
something
sorted
down
my
mind,
how
could
there
ever
be
a
federal
policy
favoring
keeping
the
state
claim
in
the
federal
court
because
by
hypothesis,
is
not
your
state
claim
always
one
that
could
not
have
been
brought
in
federal
court
in
first
instance
at
least
against
the
particular
defendant
that
you
are
seeking
to
bring
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
correct
that
every
situation
with
which
your
concerned
would
necessarily
be
the
common
law
or
state
law
claim
and
the
kind
that
would
be
brought
in
the
federal
court
only
on
diversity
grounds
if
they
were
diversity?
unknown
speaker
not
against
the
defendant
whom
you
cannot
sue
in
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
would
you
prevail
against
the
statute
on
the
federal
claim
that
same
record
entitled
you
to
prevail
against
the
county,
i
think
you
told
this
on
the
state
claim
because
under
washington
law
the
county
is
responsible
if
it
is
treasurer
is
responsible,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
i
say
if
--
if
you
can
join
the
county,
that
is
pendant
party
then
you
would
have
only
one
record,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
same
record
you
would
rely
on
for
a
recovery
against
the
treasurer
on
the
federal
claim,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
would
the
evidence
on
both
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
alright
and
if
the
evidence
satisfied
your
federal
claim
against
whom?
unknown
speaker
alright.
and
the
state
claim
would
be
against
the
county,
the
(inaudible),
employer,
no?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
did
you
prevail
on
the
state
claims
rather
–
if
the
same
evidence
would
you
entitle
you
to
prevail
on
both
the
state
and
federal
claims
against
treasurer,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
having
a
recovery
against
the
treasurer
on
the
state
claim,
does
that
also
give
you
recovery
against
the
county?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
why
–
and
that
you
want
to
make
the
county
a
party?
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
to
make
--
say
the
county
would
be
a
pendent
party
to
a
state
claim?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rosenberg,
you
get
to
state
issue
in
a
federal
court
as
a
pendent
issue
under
gibbs?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
want
something
pendent
to
that
state
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
pendent?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that
the
evidence
will
be
identical
as
you
say,
till
we
know
what
those
state
claims
are?
for
example,
you
mentioned
the
libel
claim
which
you
have
not
actually
alleged
in
the
complaint
which
might
require
proof
of
publication
at
third
parties
which
is
not
a
part
of
federal
claim.
and
each
of
your
state
claims
might
involve
some
fact
not
necessarily
part
of
your
federal
claim,
is
that
not
true?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
part
of
your
burden
to
show
that
the
evidence
that
the
evidence
would
be
substantially
identical,
you
really
have
not
done
that
until
you
pleaded
your
state
claim,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
can
he
do
that
on
this
particular
pleadings?
unknown
speaker
in
the
moor
case,
that
was
not
the
outcome
was
it.
unknown
speaker
you
prevail
here
and
still
lose
ultimately.
unknown
speaker
i
believe
that
courts
of
appeals
agree
with
you
on
pendent
party.
unknown
speaker
it
is
ruled
on
it
except
the
ninth.
unknown
speaker
every
court
agrees
with
you
except
the
ninth?
unknown
speaker
but
because
that
has
ruled
on
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
would
you
--
the
court
of
the
appeals
have
ruled
against
you
here?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
so
they
are
the
only
circuit
against
you?
unknown
speaker
yes
sir.
and
the
seventh
as
well
but
i—
alright,
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
can
keep
it
going
as
long
as
at
did
the—
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
case
ever
filed
in
a
trail
court
of
your
state
stating
a
cause
of
action
under
42
united
states
code
before
1983?
unknown
speaker
the
jurisdictional
statute
28,
united
states
code
1343
conferring
federal
district
court
jurisdiction
over
such
cause
of
action,
would
a
state
court
in
washington
as
matter
of
its
jurisdiction
under
the
law
of
the
state
have
jurisdiction
over
a
cause
of
action
stated
under
42
united
states
code
1983?
unknown
speaker
that
section
does
not
give
any
jurisdiction
42,
volume
42,
volume
28,
1343
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
not
exclusively
nor
un-exclusively,
it
just
gives
federal
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
and
i
just
wanted
if
your
state
courts,
trial
courts
had
jurisdiction
over
a
cause
of
action
brought
--
stated
under
1983
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
bring
it
to
the
federal
district
court?
unknown
speaker
just
said
is
true
with
the
respect
to
any
diversity
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
defense
could
be
frustrated
by
the
fact
if
he
is
pulled
down
the
federal
side,
he
just
cannot
get
a
definitive
state
to
ruling
on
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
1969
rather
disparages
this
once
valid
idea
about
the
new
englanders
getting
a
bad
deal
in
some
other
jurisdiction
and
vice
versa,
that
was
not?
unknown
speaker
but
diversity
jurisdiction
only
congress
can
do
that?
unknown
speaker
are
suggesting,
we
can
do
something
about
pendent
jurisdiction
cases?
unknown
speaker
and
ancillary
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
citation
of
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
but
it
did,
it
did
not
have
to
do
with
this
subject,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
then
they
are
from
where?
unknown
speaker
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
district
court's
order
remand
as
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
disagreement
indicated
as
to
the
erroneous,
is
erroneous
action
in
remand.
unknown
speaker
by
the
way
i
noticed
that
the
judge
in
his
order
dismissing
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
all
refer
to
some
state
claim.
unknown
speaker
they
just
–
but
they
were
stated
orally
in
the
sense
that
they
were
provable
under
the
facts
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
the
law
refer
to
whom
there
was
one.
unknown
speaker
they
stated
there
was
one
and
i
mean
it
said
that
these
state
claims?
unknown
speaker
the
one
that
exist
as
my
brother
white
says
if
you
look
on
page
27
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
unknown
speaker
if
you
look
at
page
20
in
the
record
the
district
judge
in
dismissing
said,
nor
has
this
court
power
to
exercise
pendent
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
against
spokane
county?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brockett
do
you
read
the
ninth
circuit
as
did
the
district
court
as
holding
that
there
is
no
power
and
not
merely
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
exercise
the
power
but
existed.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
it
is
the
district
--
that
is
why
you
read
that
the
court
of
appeals
also
is
going
up
on
power.
i
found
the
opinion
a
little
bit
ambiguous
but
--
unknown
speaker
if
he
sued
the
treasurer
and
the
county
in
the
state
court,
the
county
on
a
state
law
claims
and
the
treasurer
on
the
federal
claim
and
the
state
claim.
and
the
treasurer
removed
to
the
federal
court.
do
you
think
the
whole
case
could
come
to
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
statute
means,
it
says
the
entire
case
maybe
removed?
unknown
speaker
the
power
of
the
question?
unknown
speaker
if
it
could
not
be
a
question
and
if
the
whole
case
were
removable
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
is
but
if
it
were
wholly
removable
and
the
federal
court
could
handle
it,
it
would
not
be
a
jurisdictional
issue?
