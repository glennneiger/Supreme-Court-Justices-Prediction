mr.
norman
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1966,
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
mine
worker
versus
gibbs
clarified
and
explained
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
in
this
lengthy
and
comprehensive
opinion,
the
court
referred
to
the
joinder
of
claims.
it
did
not
refer
to
the
joinder
of
parties
specifically
and
that
raises
the
issue
that
is
before
you
today.
and
this
issue
is
this.
whether
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
assert
pendent
jurisdiction
over
claims,
state
law
claims
that
are
appropriately
related
to
existing
federal
claims
against
the
party
over
whom
there
is
no
independent
of
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction.
now
since
gibbs
this
issue—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct.
now
since
gibbs
this
issue
has
arisen
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
in
many
different
factual
settings
and
context.
now,
the
very
simple
facts
of
this
case
raise
the
issue
quite
clearly
and
i
would
like
to
set
them
forth
very
briefly.
the
petitioner
was
fired
from
her
public
position
in
the
county
treasurers
office.
the
county
treasurer
fired
her
and
then
published
in
a
letter
that
her
work
was
excellent
but
that
she
had
been
living
with
her
boyfriend,
that
this
is
un-true
as
of
no
importance
to
this
situation.
obviously,
though
these
facts
raised
both
federal
and
state
law
causes
of
action.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
there
would
your
honor.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
against
the
county,
yes
sir.
because
under
washington
law
the
county
is
specifically
liable
for
the
torts
of
its
officers,
agents
and
employees.
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court
asserted
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
claims
against
both
parties
and
state
claim
and
asserted
pendent
jurisdiction
over
the
state
claims
that
existed
as
well.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
you
honor
the
–
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
feel
obligated
to
explain.
this
complaint
is
not
well
drafted.
there
are
sufficient
matters
and
sufficient
allegations
in
it
to
raise
the
state
claims
under
appropriate
rules
of
federal
procedure
and
pleading.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
okay.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
if
that
is
true,
it
does
not
exist,
but
it
does
exist,
they
are
statements.
okay,
first
of
all,
the
state
claims
are
this,
in
the
appendix
the
complaint
is
on
page
12.
first
of
all,
the
state
claims
are
the
intentional
invasion
of
the
petitioner’s
privacy,
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
the
tort
of
libel
perhaps
slandered.
now,
let
me
go
through
the
complaint
and
show
where
the
allegations
are
your
honor.
first
of
all
the
county
is
named,
that
is
in
the
caption.
secondly,
the
the
treasurer
is
named
as
a
county
official
and
the
county
is
being
sued
and
the
treasurer
is
being
sued
in
his
capacity
as
county
official.
fourth,
in
paragraph
six
on
page
14,
it
says
defendant
spokane
county
is
a
public
corporation
and
an
action
may
be
maintained
against
it.
and
of
course,
the
complaint
asserts
that
pending
jurisdictions
made.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
well,
the
list
of
state
claims
is
not
there
but
sufficient
facts
are
available
your
honor
to
show
that
a
claim
is
available
against
that
county.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor
under
civil
rule
eight,
under
notice
pleadings
we
have
alleged
enough
facts.
let
me
a
list
the
facts
for
you?
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
in
the
appendix
on
page
12,
all
facts
in
record
are
in
the
amended
complaint.
now
with
that
complaint
reflects
is
that
there
was
a
firing,
the
stated
reasons
for
firing,
the
committing
of
the
reasons
or
the
expression
of
the
reasons.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
deal
with
these.
now,
the
court
had
the
power
to
cause
us
to
amend
the
pleadings.
he
could
have
dismissed
under
rule
12
(b)
(6).
he
could
have
entertained
a
motion
to
strike,
a
motion
for
a
more
specific
statement.
i
submit
that
the
power
of
question
is
the
threshold
question
that
this
court
must
deal
with
before
the
district
court
has
the
opportunity
to
help
us
straighten
out
our
complaint.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
well
your
honor
the
case
of
conley
v.
gibson
would
have
to
guide
the
court
in
that
determination.
and
of
course
conley
is
concerned
with
the
district
court’s
dismissal
under
rule
12
(b)
(6).
and
if
i
could
quote
something
very
briefly
from
conley,
i
think
you
will
find
that
we
have
stated
sufficient
facts
to
apprise
the
county
of
the
nature
of
the
claim
against
it.
conley
states
on
page
45,
in
appraising
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint,
we
follow
of
course
the
accepted
rule
that
a
complaint
should
not
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
the
state
a
claim
unless
it
appears
beyond
doubt
that
the
plaintiff
can
prove
no
set
of
facts
in
support
of
his
claim
which
would
entitle
to
him
to
relief.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
no
state
law,
no
local
ordinance
regulation
can
empower
anyone,
a
state
official,
a
county
official
or
anyone
else
to
violate
someone’s
civil
rights.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
if
a
tort
was
involved
and—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir,
your
honor.
you
are
ignoring
the
state
law
claim
of
libel,
slander,
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor
i
admit
that.
i
concede
that
point.
but
i
also
suggest
very
strongly
that
we
can
fix
this
complaint
up
so
that
it
has
suitable
state
law
claims
in
a
list.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor
this
actions
is
—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor?
mr.
norman
rosenberg
this
case
is
staid
in
the
district
court
pending
the
outcome
of
the
power
question.
if
that
court
has
the
power
to
consider
the
state
claims
i
guarantee
you
that
he
will
assist
us
to
make
them
more
clear
to
him.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
we
will
draw
the
complaint.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir,
i
would
like
you
not
to
deal
with
this
issue.
i
would
like
you
to
get
to
the
power
question
that
is
before
you.
the
district
court
dismissed
all
the
claims
against
this
spokane
county.
it
dismissed
the
federal
claims
in
light
of
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
and
then
it
dismissed
the
state
law
claims
simply
by
stating
that
it
no
longer
had
an
independent
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction,
so
it
could
entertain
them.
now,
the
district
court
recognized
the
problems
that
it
had
and
it
dismissed
the
state
law
claims
without
getting
to
the
merits
of
them
in
the
way
that
it
felt
would
be
the
clearest
possible
way
to
point
out
the
incongruity
that
exists
in
the
federal
system.
the
order
of
the
dismissal
states
it
very
clearly
that
he
did
not
get
to
the
merits
and
that
he
dismissed
solely
because
he
has
not
the
power
and
he
included
the
rule
54
(b)
certificate
and
a
certificate
pursuant
to
28
u.s.
code
1292.
we
went
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
who
affirmed
and
certiorari
by
this
court
was
granted.
meanwhile,
the
proceedings
are
staid
in
the
district
court.
now
the
incongruity
that
the
court
tried
to
point
out
was
that
the
gibbs
case
is
being
misconstrued
and
misapplied
in
two
clearly
opposing
and
exclusive
ways.
the
joinder
of
claims
very
easily
could
contemplate
the
joinder
of
parties
in
a
number
of
cases.
and
the
majority
of
the
circuits
and
district
courts
have
held
that,
inappropriate
cases
parties
are
accidentally
joined.
the
ninth
circuit
however
has
ruled
that
there
is
absolutely
no
power
to
join
parties
and
these
claims
cannot
be
joined,
no
matter
what
the
circumstance,
no
matter
how
closely
related
to
the
federal
claims.
the
ninth
circuit
admits
that
support
for
its
position
is
eroding
and
this
court
pointed
out
in
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
that
the
ninth
circuit
stood
virtually
alone
in
its
inflexible
lack
of
power
theory.
well,
the
answer
to
this
question
is
a
difficult
one
and
it
requires
this
court
to
put
itself
in
the
place
of
the
district
courts
that
contend
daily
with
a
very
heavy
docket
and
a
very
large
trial
case
load.
and
what
is
the
answer?
the
answer
that
the
district
courts
have
found
in
many
cases
is
to
join
all
possible
claims
that
are
related
to
one
another
and
try
them
all
in
one
suit
and
dispose
off
them
simultaneously
and
pendent
jurisdiction
allows
them
to
do
this,
especially
pendent
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
joinder
of
parties.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes.
we
could
have
your
honor.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
sure,
we
could
have
your
honor.but
the
petitioner
felt
and
i
agree
that
it
is
unwise
to
sue
spokane
county
and
an
officer
of
spokane
county
in
spokane
county
superior
court.
she
was
given
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
felt
that
it
would
be
the
wiser
choice
to
make.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
i
am
suggesting
simply
that
as
a
tactical
matter
it
was
felt
wiser
not
to
sue
spokane
county
in
spokane
county
superior
court.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
tell
you
more
than
that
because
i
was
not
present
at
that
the
time.
at
this
point,
we
will
agree
analysis.
i
would
feel
that
i
agree
with
a
number
of
studies
that
have
been
made
with
regard
to
the
distinction
between
federal
and
state
jurisdiction
and
i
feel
that
in
federal
question
cases
there
is
a
strong
federal
policy
to
keep
the
cases
in
federal
court.
i
would
refer
this
court
to
page
51
of
the
opening
brief.
in
the
footnote
there
is
quotations
from
an
american
law
institute
study
on
the
division
of
jurisdiction
and
it
gives
three
very
good
reasons
why
federal
cases
should
be
heard
in
federal
court.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
and
judicial
economy
convenience
are
the
primary
considerations
that
the
court
should
consider
when
electing
to
join
or
not
join
pendent
claims
or
pendent
parties.
pendent
jurisdiction
is
a
doctrine
of
discretion.
the
court
may
or
may
not
join
as
it
sees
fit
and
the
reasons
frequently
cited
are
judicial
economy,
convenience
to
the
parties,
avoidance
of
piecemeal
litigation.
there
are
a
number
of
very
good
reasons.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
that
is
correct
but
i
see
no
significance
in
that
distinction
your
honor.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor
that
party
is
there
available
to
be
sued
and
will
be
sued
in
one
court
or
the
other.
the
question
is
whether
we
will
have
two
trials
or
one
of
precisely
and
exactly
the
very
same
issue.
by
state
law,
the
county
is
liable
for
the
torts
of
its
officers.
that
means
that
the
trials
that
we
are
going
to
have
over
the
state
claims
against
the
treasurer
are
exactly
the
same
trial
that
we
will
have
over
the
state
claims
against
the
county
identical
in
every
way?
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
well,
your
honor
we
did
not
anticipate
an
appeal
on
this
procedural
issue
we
have
been
trying
to
get
to
court
for
a
long
time.
the
federal
court
and
the
county
superior
court
are
within
six
blocks
of
one
another.
the
county
is
--
it
is
just
as
convenient
for
the
county
to
go
to
one
as
the
other.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
that
is
true.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
keep
in
mind
however
that
this
doctrine
arises
not
only
in
this
particular
case
but
it
cuts
across
jurisdiction
lines.
it
comes
up
with
respect
to
virtually
every
jurisdiction
granting
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
there
are
some
that
are
exclusively
federal.
what
happens
in
those
cases,
when
the
party
came
up
to
the
state
court?
in
this
case
we
happen
to
be
able
to
but
we
made
a
choice
of
forums
that
was
open
to
us
under
the
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
that
is
true.
at
this
point
it
is
probably
important
for
me
to
recite
some
of
the
considerations
that
the
courts
have
found
in
joining
pendent
parties
not
only
claims
but
parties
as
well
in
virtually
every
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction,
it
is
plaintiffs
and
defendants
have
been
joined
in
federal
question
cases,
diversity
cases,
taft-hartley
cases,
gibbs
was
a
labor
management
relations
act
case,
federal
employers
liability
act
cases,
sec
cases,
civil
rights
cases,
patent-copyright
cases,
admiralty
cases.
no
one
could
possibility
foretell
the
combination
of
federal
and
state
clams
that
will
arise.
and
that
is
why
pending
jurisdiction
is
the
appropriate
vehicle
to
deal
with
this
situation.
while
the
court
has
the
power
to
join
it
does
not
have
the
obligation
to
join.
it
may
join,
if
it
feels
it
appropriate.
now
the
gibbs
court
set
out
an
appropriate
test
that
is
as
appropriate
now
as
it
was
then.
and
that
test
is
this.
first
of
all,
the
court
must
consider
the
substance
of
the
claims.
obviously,
if
there
is
strong
federal
policy
to
keep
it
in
federal
court
then
the
court
should
do
that.
are
the
state
claims
such
that
they
would
confuse
the
issue.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
mr.
chief
justice
stevens.
i
think
i
made
a
slip,
i
meant
of
the
federal
cause
of
action.
there
is
strong
federal
policy
to
keep
some
in
federal
court
and
in
others,
there
is
no
strong
federal
policy.
for
example,
in
a
diversity
basis
of
jurisdiction
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
federal
court
keeps
it
or
not
because
they
are
applying
state
law.
in
some
federal
question
cases,
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
and
it
has
sustained
federal
court.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir,
no
sir,
not
all.
this
is
raised
in
virtually
every
jurisdiction
granting
basis
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
that
is
true.
but
there
is
a
claim
against
somebody
who
is
appropriately
and
closely
related
to
the
other
defendant.
now,
we
are
in
federal
court
already,
there
is
an
existing
federal
claim.
the
question
is
simply,
may
we
join
the
appropriately
and
closely
related
state
claims.
and
have
one
trial
of
all
the
issues
that
are
raised
out
of
the
set
facts
or
two.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
the
county
is
not
responsible,
the
county
maybe
liable.
we
would
have
to
proceed
against
the
county
and
sue
them
and
try
the
case
again.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
if
we
can
join
the
county
we
have
to—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
there
are
different
claims
involved,
there
is
a
federal
claim
and
they
are
a
separate
state
claims.
now
the
state
claim
--
mr.
norman
rosenberg
identical.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
the
federal
claim
is
against
the
treasurer.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
there
are
state
claims
against
the
treasurer
as
well.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
and
it
is
those
state
claims
against
the
treasurer
that
are
identical
with
the
state
claims
against
the
county.
there
is
a
separate
federal
claim,
there
are
separate
elements.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
very
similar
evidence.
there
is
a
few
extra
ingredients
in
the
federal
claim
but
virtually
identical
evidence.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
well,
if
the
county
was
a
party,
yes,
because
it
is
identical
issue.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
the
claim
against
the
county
is
a
pendent
claim
and
by
virtue
of
the
being
against
the
county,
the
county
is
pendent
party.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir,
there
is
state—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
the
state
claim
is
to
be
pendent
to
a
federal
claim.
there
are
already
state
claims
in
the
federal
court,
the
state
claims
against
the
treasurer.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
and
they
are
pendent
to
the
federal
claims
against
the
treasurer.
now
we
also
have
state
claims
against
the
county
and
they
too
should
be
pendent
to
the
federal
claim.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
that
is
true.
and
you
would
not
know
that.
the
district
court
will
know
that.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
on
the
district
court
level,
that
is
true
because
the
district
court
must
make
an
inquiry
and
determine
if
the
case,
if
the
two
claims
are
reasonably
related
and
closely
related,
sufficient
for
him
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
them
and
he
will
make
an
inquiry
in
this
regard.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
certainly
not.
well
he
cannot
do
it
whether
this
pleading
is
good
or
bad
because
he
does
not
have
the
power
to
do
it,
and
that
is
what
he
said
in
his
order
of
dismissal.
he
specifically
refused
to
rule
on
the
validity
and
whether
our
state
claims
were
suitable
or
not.
he
cannot
do
it
whether
he
wants
to
or
not.
now,
district
courts
and
all
the
other
circuits
can
do
it
but
he
cannot.
and
that
is
the
problem
with
this
case.
how
can
a
court
make
a
decision
like
this?
the
court
first
of
all,
i
submit
has
to
have
the
power.
once
it
has
the
power,
it
has
to
make
an
inquiry
and
determine
the
nature
of
the
claims
and
whether
they
are
suitably
related
and
the
gibbs
court
sets
forth
an
appropriate
test
for
a
relationships.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
he
would
read
the
complaint
to
determine
what
the
causes
of
action
are.
he
would--
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
submit
and
i
admit
that
this
complaint
is
not
very
well
drafted.
i
submit
strongly
however—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor
–
mr.
norman
rosenberg
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
dismissed,
it
was
dismissed—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
the
case
was
dismissed
in
1971.
it
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
as
well
as
abstention.
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
was
reversed
or
remanded
because
there
was
a
state,
there
was
a
claim
stated.
now
that
of
course
was
referring
to
a
federal
claim.
they
did
not
get
to
the
validity
of
the
state
claims.
but
the
district
court
can
straighten
out
this
complaint.
he
can
order
us
to
amend
it.
he
can
dismiss
it
if
he
wishes.
he
can
do
anything
he
wants
to
do
with
it.
but
at
this
point,
he
does
even
have
the
power
to
consider
it.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
we
could
have
done
that.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
well,
if
the
case
was
not
dismissed
in
the
initial
rounds
of
pleadings,
it
would
have
been
over
four
years
ago.
yes,
we
could
have
filed
it
in
the
state
court.
but
in
terms
of
election
of
remedies
that
are
available
to
us,
we
selected
the
federal
court.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor,
with
do
all
the
respect
there
has
never
been
a
time
that
there
was
only
a
state
claim.
there
is
always
been
a
federal
claim
against
the
county
treasurer.
there
has
always
been
that
claim,
except
when
it
was
dismissed
and
reversed
to
remanded.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
your
honor,
of
course
this
issue
was
not
before
the
court.
the
fact
is
we
are
in
federal
court
and
the
whether
the
federal
court
can
pend
state
claims
to
it
or
not,
whether
they
have
the
power
to
do
that
is
the
only
issue.
let
me
be
as
clear
as
i
can,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
rule
that
the
district
court
must
hear
the
state
claims
simply
that
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
hear
them
and
if
it
wishes
to
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
it
will
do
that.
i
feel
confident
that
we
can
go
back
before
the
district
court
and
convince
them
that
it
is
an
important
thing
to
do.
i—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
this
court
found—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes.
that
is
true
we
could.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
the
district
of
columbia,
the
first,
second,
third,
fourth,
fifth,
six
and
eight.
the
tenth—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no,
the
ninth
has
ruled
on
it
and
disagrees
very
vehemently.
the
seventh
circuit—
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
--
mr.
norman
rosenberg
no
sir.
the
seventh
does
not.
the
seventh
has
ruled
on
it
only
once
and
really
did
not
give
it
suitable
treatment.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir.
and
that
is
understandable,
i
think.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes,
the
ninth
circuit
of
appeals.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
let
me
--
i
would
like
to
read
something
from
a
very
recent
first
circuit
of
appeals
opinion
in
conclusion.
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
dealing
with
a
case
that
had
a
virtually
interminable
history
in
the
federal
court
system.
it
had
been
appealed
a
number
of
times.
it
was
exceedingly
complex,
multiple
parties,
multiple
issues
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
treatment
of
it,
they
said
this,
this
case
is
one
where
if
there
had
not
existed
a
doctrine
allowing
federal
jurisdiction
over
pendent
parties
it
would
have
had
to
be
invented.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
this
is
very
important.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
i
think
in
order
to
sort
it
all
out,
i
think
he
was
referring
to
the
problems
that
would
exist
if
the
case
was
bifurcated
in
a
number
of
different
courts.
he
would
have
a
bigger
problem
than
he
had
right
then.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
left.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
not
specific
cases
because
again
of
the
choice
by
counsel
in
filing
in
federal
district
courts.
mr.
norman
rosenberg
yes
sir,
very
briefly.
i
too
found
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion
very
curious.
on
the
hand
they
affirmed
that
there
was
no
power.
on
the
other
hand
he
did
what
he
did
not
allow
the
district
court
to
do,
analyze
on
a
case
by
case
basis
whether
it
was
appropriate
to
join
the
case.
he
said
that
this
case
was
not
an
appropriate
one
to
join,
that
is
his
view.
implicitly
that
states
that
there
are
cases
that
are
appropriate
to
join
and
that
is
the
value
of
pendant
jurisdiction.
the
reason
for
pendent
jurisdiction
has
had
woven
through
it,
the
underlying
rationale
of
judicial
of
economy
and
it
is
only
the
district
court
that
has
the
case
before
it
that
can
decide
with
any
effectiveness
at
all,
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
join
all
the
claims
and
hear
them
all.
an
inflexible
rule
will
be
unworkable,
will
cause
distress
and
will
not
promote
judicial
economy
but
will
cause
duplication
of
law
suit.
thank
you.
