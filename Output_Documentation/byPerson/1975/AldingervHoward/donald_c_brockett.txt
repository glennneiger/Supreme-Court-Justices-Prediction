mr.
donald
c.
brockett
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
difficulty
that
the
court
is
having
with
the
complaint
in
this
case
and
with
the
allegations
contained
their
in
are
some
of
the
problems
that
the
county
had
with
being
joined
as
the
party
or
the
attempt
to
join
the
county
as
a
party
in
the
federal
district
court
in
spokane
county.
and
further
it
would
be
our
contention
as
it
has
been
in
the
brief
that
we
filed
with
this
court
that
if
this
court
gets
beyond
the
complaint
to
a
realization
that
there
is
in
fact
the
state
claim
which
has
been
alleged
that
could
be
pendent
to
a
federal
claim
under
the
civil
rights
action.
that
it
should
then
seriously
reconsider
the
doctrines
of
the
pendent
and
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
may
not
be
part
of
the
problem
with
the
federal
court
systems
and
with
the
numbers
of
cases
that
are
filed
in
the
federal
court
systems
at
the
present
day.
one
of
the
admissions,
i
think
by
counsel
here
is
that
the
case
could
well
have
been
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
spokane
county
on
the
basis
of
the
state
claims,
if
there
were
any
and
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
claim
of
the
violation
of
federal
civil
rights
act.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
i
do
not
think
i
know
of
any
particular
actions
your
honor
that
has
been
filed
in
the
state
courts.
but
i
think
it
is
because
of
the
fact
that
counsel
representing
individuals
in
civil
rights
case,
feel
as
counsel
stated
here
that
it
is
wiser
to
file
those
cases
in
federal
courts.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
i
do
not
believe
your
honor
that
that
particular
section
of
united
states
code
gives
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
federal
jurisdiction,
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
i
believe
that
they
would
have
the
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
court
in
order
to
hear
that
particular
case.
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
--no.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
now
the
attempt
in
this
particular
case
and
i
think
again
this
is
the
poorest
case
where
this
court
to
be
deciding
the
matter
of
pendent
jurisdiction
in
attaching
a
state
claim
to
a
federal
claim
because
of
the
fact
that
the
complaint
itself
alleges
an
absence
of
a
state
claim.
in
fact
as
this
court
has
noted
the
revised
code
of
washington
36.16.070
specifically
provides
that
the
treasurer
of
spokane
county
as
any
other
elected
official
of
spokane
county
has
the
discretion
to
discharge
at
pleasure
an
employee
and
what
counsel
is
asking
in
this
case,
what
petitioner
is
asking
is
that
the
particular
statute
when
and
if
it
is
ruled
to
be
unconstitutional,
or
to
have
been
applied
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
would
then
create
a
state
claim
against
the
county
for
the
action
of
the
treasurer
and
would
then
ask
that
that
state
claim
may
be
made
pendent
to
the
federal
cause
action
which
has
been
filed
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act.
the
difficulty
that
the
county
expresses
here
is
as
much
the
same
as
the
difficulty
expressed
to
this
in
court
in
moor
versus
county
of
alameda,
that
there
is
to
be
a
system
of
federalism,
that
there
is
to
be
a
distinction
between
the
state
and
federal
courts
and
that
as
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
said
in
a
recent
opinion,
if
such
an
extension
of
pendent
jurisdiction
as
this
would
allow
to
bring
in
to
the
case
an
additional
party
that
this
court
has
held
should
not
be
a
person
under
the
federal
civil
rights
action.
that
that
would
only
call
for
ingenious
counsel
to
determine
that
there
was
a
federal
question
and
then
determine
that
there
should
be
pendent
jurisdiction
over
any
state
claim
that
might
be
thought
to
exist
and
therefore
would
go
into
the
federal
court
system.
the
questions
of
jurisdiction
are
questions
of
course,
of
constitutional
law
and
it
has
been
determined
and
it
has
been
written
specifically
in
article
3,
section
2
of
the
constitution
that
the
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
many
of
the
writers
on
the
extension
of
pendent
jurisdiction
and
ancillary
jurisdiction
and
the
confusion
between
the
two
doctrines
have
indicated
and
the
county
would
propose
here
that
the
federal
court
system
is
becoming
a
system
of
general
jurisdiction
by
means
of
the
use
of
pendent
jurisdiction
to
allow
the
joining
of
state
claims
in
particular
cases.
and
it
is
especially
an
extension
which
i
do
not
believe
this
court
wishes
to
exercise
in
this
case
because
it
would
join
a
party
which
has
specific
been
held
not
to
be
a
person
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
problems
created
by
the
extension
of
pendent
jurisdiction
are
many
and
have
been
mentioned
in
various
writings
and
i
think
this
court
should
certainly
consider
those
problems.
number
one,
the
major
problem
is
that
if
the
state
court
in
considering
a
question
of
federal
law
should
err
in
interpreting
the
federal
law
then
it
can
be
corrected
on
review
by
this
court.
however,
if
the
federal
district
court
would
err
in
interpreting
a
state
law
that
particular
question
is
not
subject
to
review
by
the
state
courts.
and
therefore
this
court
should
consider
that
question
and
force
these
causes
of
action
to
be
tried
on
the
basis
of
state
claims
in
state
courts
with
an
appropriate
review
by
this
court
or
other
federal
courts.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
true
your
honor
but
i
thinkâ€”
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
the
diversity
case
i
would
contend
to
you
is
a
different
situation
in
the
federal
question
case
and
the
allowing
of
the
expansion
of
the
federal
question
case
by
pendent
jurisdiction.
diversity
is
specifically
granted
to
the
federal
courts
on
the
basis
of
the
idea
historically
that
an
individual
who
was
the
citizen
of
another
state
could
not
get
a
fair
trial
by
coming
into
that
particular
state.
there
is
some
questioning
of
that
particular
doctrine
at
present
time
because
of
the
movement
of
society
in
the
present
day
and
the
fact
that
there
are
many
lawsuits
that
are
brought
in
local
jurisdictions
that
are
in
fact
holding
police
officers
liable
for
their
conduct
and
i
would
warrant
in
this
particular
case
if
the
facts
warranted
would
hold
the
treasurer
and
the
county
liable
for
any
tortuous
conduct.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
think
that
is
something
for
this
court
to
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
--
in
fact
the
diversity
problem
has
not
crept
into
the
federal
question
problem
through
the
use
of
this.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
right.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
yes,
and
what
i
am
suggesting
--
excuse
me.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
yes,
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
court
go
back
historically
to
the
constitution
and
determine
that
the
federal
courts
should
have
province
and
power
only
over
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
united
states
or
diversity
cases
which
as
your
honor
has
said
they
can
do
nothing
about.
i
think
it
is
ridiculous
for
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
or
pendent
jurisdiction
to
have
allowed
an
extension
and
to
in
effect
fill
up
the
federal
courts
with
questions
that
should
be
better
heard
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
yes.
what
we
are
saying
your
honor
is
that
specifically
this
court
should
refuse
to
go
any
further
than
it
has
or
in
fact
may
wish
to
retreat
from
the
position
that
it
took
in
moor
versus
county
of
alameda
and
determine
in
fact
that
there
should
not
even
be
a
pendent
jurisdiction
over
claims
even
though
between
the
same
parties
but
--
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
yes,
and
overrule
gibbs
but
that
--
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
and
hurn
against
oursler
and
the
other
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
i
would
refer
to
phrase
which
i
found
in
briefing
for
this
case
that
i
thought
was
of
interest
from
mr.
justice
holmes
in
which
he
once
said,
in
my
opinion
the
prevailing
doctrine
has
been
accepted
upon
a
subtle
fallacy
that
never
has
been
analyzed
if
i
am
right
the
fallacy
has
resulted
in
an
unconstitutional
assumption
of
powers
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states
which
no
lapse
of
time
or
respectable
array
of
opinion
should
make
us
hesitate
to
correct.
now
what
i
would
say
on
the
basis
of
that
is
that
ancillary
jurisdiction--.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
i
am
sorry
your
honor
it
is
not
from
the
case
i
think
it
is
from
the
speech
of
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
no
it
did
not.
it
was
not
on
the
question.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
if
it
were
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
should
reanalyze
its
opinions
and
retreat
from
them
if
it
is
warranted.
i
think
that
this
court
should
find
that
ancillary
jurisdiction
certainly
has
a
role
to
play
in
the
federal
jurisdictional
scheme
of
things.
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
its
proper
role
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
hear
those
matters
which
are
ancillary
to
the
cause
before
the
court
on
the
basis
of
the
defendant
who
is
an
unwilling
party
to
the
action,
who
has
been
brought
into
the
action
and
decides
that
he
wishes
to
raise
a
matter
which
is
within
then
the
ancillary
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
pendent
jurisdiction
problem
however,
whether
it
extends
to
claims
as
it
was
extended
in
this
court
by
moor
versus
county
of
alameda
or
more
importantly
whether
it
extends
to
parties
who
are
not
properly
a
party
to
the
particular
action
as
we
allege,
the
county
of
spoken
is
not
in
this
case.
the
court
should
distinguish
between
those
doctrines
and
we
would
submit,
it
should
overrule
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
and
not
allow
it
within
the
federal
courts.
the
doctrine
has
created
problems
in
this
regard,
it
would
seem
appropriate
that
a
court
either
has
jurisdiction
over
a
case
or
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
a
case.
this
court
recently
in
january
the
28th
of
this
year
in
the
case
of
thermtron
products,
inc.
v.
hermansdorfer
ruled
that
once
a
case
has
been
removed
to
the
federal
district
court
that
district
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
case
and
that
in
fact
that
the
court
was
somewhat
split
on
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that
jurisdiction
could
be
given
up
and
the
case
could
be
sent
back
to
the
state
court
because
of
the
crowded
docket
of
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
correct.
part
of
the
issue
was
your
honorâ€”
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
no.
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
statements
however
in
that
case
that
i
am
referring
to
that
i
would
allege
in
this
case
is
appropriate
is
that
the
court
once
it
had
jurisdiction
could
not
give
it
up.
now,
the
reason
that
i
state
that
is
for
this
reason,
in
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
under
the
moor
versus
the
county
of
alameda
case,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
court
has
said,
that
some
courts
have
jurisdiction
but
do
not
need
to
exercise
it,
that
in
fact
it
is
discretionary
with
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
that
jurisdiction
should
be
exercised.
i
would
warrant
and
contend
to
this
court
that
we
decide
that
either
the
courts
has
jurisdiction
which
shall
be
exercised
in
all
cases
or
it
does
not
have
the
jurisdiction
and
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
judge,
judge
neil
in
this
court
said
that
he
was
without
power
to
hear
this
particular
state
claim
because
of
the
factâ€”
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
well,
your
honor
that
is
the
interesting
--
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
correct.
although
our
contention
is
that
there
is
a
specific
allegation
in
the
complaint
itself
that
the
action
as
taken
was
warranted
by
state
statute
so
that
there
can
in
fact
be
no
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
yes.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
they
were
concerned
about
that
state
claim
if
one
existed
but
then
retreated
to
the
position
that
they
had
no
power
to
even
consider
whether
a
state
claim
existed
because
of
the
particular
doctrine.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
yes.
and
those
claims
were
just
claims
that
were
assumed
to
be
existing
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
court
had
power
to
even
hear
the
case.
and
that
is
why
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
opinion
that
the
court
did
not
have
the
power.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
that
is
correct.
in
fact
in
this
particular
case
if
the
cases
sent
back
from
this
court
and
goes
back
to
the
federal
district
court
he
may
still
exercise
the
discretion
not
to
hear
the
case
because
--
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
no.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
court
does
in
fact
as
this
district
court
has
said
before
virtually
stands
alone
in
determining
that
the
pendent
jurisdiction
may
not
be
extended
to
pendent
parties.
and
that
is
the
determination
to
be
made
in
this
case
if
this
court
determines
that
this
is
an
appropriate
case
in
which
to
make
that
determination
itself.
we
would
contend
that
the
doctrine
of
removable
that
the
doctrines
of
abstention
and
certification
by
the
federal
district
courts
are
doctrines
that
have
in
fact
grown
up
as
result
of
the
fact
that
the
courts
do
not
want
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
state
law
claims
and
that
they
themselves
feel
that
these
claims
should
be
better
placed
in
the
state
courts.
that
the
state
court
should
make
state
law
that
if
that
law
then
is
interrogation
of
federal
rights
that
it
will
be
ruled
upon
by
the
federal
courts
and
will
be
appealed
to
this
particular
court.
that
otherwise
the
states
should
not
have
the
right
to
rule
on
their
own
state
law
and
as
the
chief
justice
has
mentioned
because
of
the
court
dockets
that
are
very
crowded
the
courts
and
judges
are
required
to
move
around
and
may
well
be
in
a
state
and
diversity
case
for
example
and
not
be
that
familiar
with
the
state
law.
the
federal
court
ruling
upon
the
question
of
a
state
law
may
be
looked
to
by
a
state
legislature
to
give
some
guidance
to
it
when
in
fact
the
state
legislature
should
not
be
looking
to
the
federal
court
determination.
that
determination
should
be
made
properly
by
a
state
court
with
a
review
under
our
constitutional
system
and
system
of
federalism
by
the
federal
courts.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
in
the
reply
brief
has
indicated
that
it
is
absurd
for
the
respondent
to
contend
that
this
extension
of
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
is
being
used
to
extend
the
scope
of
a
1983
action,
section
1983
of
the
united
state
code.
we
would
contend
that
that
is
not
so
absurd
when
one
looks
at
15
(m)
jury
trials
620
at
section
27
which
states
this,
pendent
jurisdiction
is
used
for
two
purposes.
one,
to
try
common
law
or
statutory
tort
claims
against
individual
defendants
sued
under
section
1983.
and
two,
to
bring
the
city
or
other
entity
into
the
action
thus
avoiding
in
part
the
holding
of
monroe
versus
pape,
that
cities
are
not
suable
under
section
1983,
we
would
contend
that
that
is
exactly
what
is
happening
in
the
federal
court
system,
and
by
the
use
of
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
and
by
an
imaginative
pleading
or
an
imaginative
party,
a
federal
cause
of
action
is
filed
and
then
the
party
attempts
to
apply
for
the
pendent
jurisdiction
over
the
state
law
claim
which
should
not
be
there.
we
would
ask
that
that
this
court
determine
that
there
is
no
power
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
to
entertain
under
pendant
jurisdiction
especially
additional
parties
that
if
there
is
power
and
if
there
is
discretion
and
for
the
court
to
hear
or
not
to
hear
on
the
basis
of
that
power
what
kind
of
a
rule
will
there
be,
that
will
be
established
throughout
the
country
upon
which
all
lawyers
and
courts
can
base
some
consideration
in
a
determination
of
the
application
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
if
it
is
to
be
based
upon
the
discretion
will
it
not
have
to
be
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
if
the
discretion
is
exercised
on
a
case
by
case
application
then
how
is
there
any
rule
to
which
one
can
refer.
the
other
difficulty
is
that
if
we
are
attempting
to
save
judicial
time
and
energy
in
adopting
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction,
how
will
there
be
a
saving
of
judicial
time
and
energy
if
the
court
has
to
determine
on
a
case
by
case
basis
in
the
federal
system
whether
or
not
the
application
of
pendent
jurisdiction
and
that
doctrine
is
appropriate
in
that
particular
case.
and
will
it
not
require
a
review
by
this
court
on
a
case
by
case
basis
as
to
the
exercise
of
that
discretion.
if
the
fairness
is
what
is
to
be
considered
then
is
there
a
fairness
to
the
defendant
who
has
a
right
to
be
sued
in
the
state
court
on
the
basis
of
the
state
law
claim
and
have
that
state
law
claim
determined
by
the
state
court
if
the
action
can
be
joined
on
the
basis
of
pendent
jurisdiction
even
though
he
was
not
a
proper
party
to
the
federal
question
filed
in
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
well,
i
think
that
that
might
well
be
a
determination
for
the
federal
district
judge
at
that
point.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
i
think
that
that
might
very
appropriately
bring
the
entire
case
into
the
federal
system
but
it
would
be
by
a
virtue
of
a
move
of
the
defendant
as
opposed
to
a
move
of
the
plaintiff
who
has
attempted.
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
well
i
think
it
is
a
power
of
the
question
when
they
look
at
it
on
the
basis
of
the
filing
by
the
plaintiff
and
the
attempt
by
him
to
join
an
additional
party
or
an
additional
claim
under
pendent
jurisdiction.
but
i
think
that
that
power
of
question
is
better
--
mr.
donald
c.
brockett
well,
your
honor
i
would
say,
i
would
submit
this
that
that
is
the
proper
application
of
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
as
opposed
to
what
should
be
distinguished
in
considering
that
jurisdiction
from
pendent
jurisdiction.
that
is
the
proper
doctrine
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
which
the
defendant
has
chosen
to
remove
and
the
defendant
who
is
in
the
court
then
asks
that
there
be
a
jurisdiction
by
appropriate
joinder
even
though
of
another
party
who
he
feels
is
liable
rather
than
himself.
the
twentieth
united
states
code
1338
(b)
which
appears
to
be
argued
as
an
extension
by
congress
of
pendent
jurisdiction
over
patent
and
copyright
cases,
the
county
would
allege
in
this
case
has
been
the
only
extension
of
that
doctrine
by
congressional
authority
and
that
the
other
extension
of
pendent
jurisdiction
has
been
a
court
created
doctrine
which
this
court
should
carefully
consider
and
recede
from
so
that
cases
will
be
appropriately
filed
in
the
state
courts,
the
determinations
will
be
made
under
state
law
in
then
if
there
is
some
difficulty
with
federal
question
or
federal
constitutional
application,
it
will
come
in
to
the
federal
courts
only
upon
that
basis.
thank
you.
