rehnquist
well,
but
that,
if
the
state
of
washington
has
a
statute
that
as
you
say
in
your
complaint,
specifically
authorizes
a
dismissal,
it
may
be
totally
unconstitutional
but
can
you
consistently
with
that
statement
statute
maintain
that
the
state
courts
would
grant
you
state
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
brockett
you
certainly
do
not
need
any
broad
doctrine
like
that
to
prevail
here
on
your
case,
do
you
all
--
you
are
saying
is
that
the
principle
of
gibbs
as
to
pendent
claim
should
not
be
extended
by
this
court
to
the
new
class
of
pendent
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
number
74-6521,
aldinger
against
howard,
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
this
case,
petitioner
aldinger
claimed
she
had
been
unconstitutionally
discharged
from
her
job
in
the
office
of
respondent,
the
treasurer
of
spokane
county,
washington,
pursued
in
the
district
court
against
respondent
under
section
1983
of
title
42
of
the
us
code,
rested
on
the
cogent
jurisdictional
statute,
section
1343.
but
she
also
asserted
a
state
law
claim
of
vicarious
tort
liability
against
an
additional
defendant,
spokane
county,
although,
congress
had
excluded
such
municipal
corporations
from
those
parties
who
could
be
sued
under
section
1983.
the
lower
courts
rejected
petitioner's
claim
that
this
court's
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
allowed
her
to
join
spokane
county
in
this
manner
as
a
pendent
party
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
among
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this
point.
our
prior
decisions,
dating
back
to
1824,
have
consistently
held
that
where
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
are
already
properly
in
federal
court,
litigating
a
federal
claim,
the
defendant
could
be
called
upon
to
answer
the
plaintiff's
related
non
federal
claim
consistently
with
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
but
we
hold
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
that
it
is
quite
a
different
matter
to
allow
a
plaintiff
to
implead
an
entirely
new
defendant
solely
for
the
purpose
of
asserting
a
state
law
claim.
since
neither
that
defendant,
nor
that
claim
would
otherwise
be
heard
by
the
federal
court.
in
this
case,
we
think
the
fact
that
congress
has,
by
reference,
excluded
parties
such
as
spokane
county
from
being
sued
under
section
1983,
requires
us
to
hold
that
the
pendent
party
jurisdiction
asserted
by
petitioner
here
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
