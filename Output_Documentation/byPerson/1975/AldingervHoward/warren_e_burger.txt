chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-6521,
aldinger
against
howard.
mr.
rosenberg
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
against
the
county?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
identify
the
place
we
will
find
them
as
we
go
along
so
we
can
mark
it
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
generally,
ordinarily
a
complaint
must
do
more
than
reflect,
it
must
allege,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
by
taxpayers
and
contractors
suing
in
the
state
courts
and
are
you
suggesting
that
some
sort
of
conflict
of
interest
or
some
lack
of
capacity
on
the
state
courts
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
a
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
me
very
much?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
washington
state
courts
do
you
have
intermediate
court
of
appeal
between
your
trial
court
and
your
superior
court
and
the
state
supreme
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
supreme
court
sits
down
on
olympia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
talking
about
judicial
economy
and
convenience
of
the
parties,
i
should
think
it
is
much
more
convenient
to
try
a
case
up
in
spokane
until
down
in
to
olympia
on
your
appeal
and
come
all
the
way
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
even
though
a
high
probability
that
the
federal
district
judge
seating
on
the
case
would
be
a
judge
familiar
with
washington
law,
he
might
be
a
judge
from
one
of
the
other
states
and
the
circuit
they
are
very
easily.
here
you
have
been
back
and
forth.
i
do
not
exactly
how
many
times
and
i
take
it
the
same
six
blocks
from
the
federal
court
to
the
state
court
works
the
other
way.
and
you
could
have
put
a
new
caption
on
this
complaint.
and
improved
the
complaint
as
you
suggest,
walk
down
the
street
and
your
action
probably
would
have
long
since
it
was
over.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
meanwhile
your
have
been
a
very
large
statistic
on
the
federal
court
systems
for
quite
a
long
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
time
when
it
appeared
that
your
only
claim
was
a
state
claimed
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
time
you
should
have
been
in
the
state
courts
ever
since
then
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
say
only
a
state
claim,
i
said,
a
state
claim
because
just
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
state
courts
are
enforcing
federal
claims
everyday
in
the
week.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
norman
rosenberg.
mr.
brockett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brockett
you
have
just
one
minute
left--
mr.
rosenberg
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
