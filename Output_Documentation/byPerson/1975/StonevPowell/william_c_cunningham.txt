mr.
william
c.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
assignment
of
duties
between
counsel,
in
our
case
my
colleague
j.
patrick
green
from
omaha,
nebraska
was
to
have
presented
the
oral
argument
and
he
has
been
incapacitated
yesterday
by
severe
attack
of
influenza.
i
propose
to
deal
with
three
points
in
the
argument
for
the
court
and
be
able
to
respond
to
questions
from
you,
and
in
this
order.
first,
we
think
it
of
primary
importance
to
deal
with
the
question
added
to
the
grant
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
30th
june,
last
year
to
whip
whether
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
search
and
seizure
performed
by
the
omaha
police
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
judicially
cognizable
under
the
28
u.s.c
2254.
almost
in
identical
language
on
that
same
day,
june
30
in
powell
versus
stone,
the
court
again
added
that
question
to
the
grant
of
certiorari
and
asked
the
parties
involved,
both
to
brief
and
to
argue
those
questions,
and
so
i
propose
to
deal
with
that
question
first.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
need
for
federal
review
at
lower
court
level
federal
constitutional
questions,
and
by
lower
court
level,
i
mean
both
the
united
states
district
courts
and
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal;
with
questions
presented
by
state
prisoners
under
28
u.s.c
2254,
in
seeking
petitions
for
habeas
--
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
thirdly,
i
would
like
to
present
arguments
regarding
the
standards
that
should
be
used
by
either
state
or
federal
courts
to
determine
a
constitutional
validity
of
the
search
in
this
case.
addressing
myself
to
the
first
question,
and
transmitting
any
discussion
of
the
facts
which
i
think
were
brought
out
to
some
extent
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
could
deal
with
those
in
questions
if
the
court
so
desires.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
think,
your
honor,
when
we
take
the
record
in
its
totality,
including
and
placing
the
special
stress
upon
the
careful
hearings
--
evidentiary
hearings
in
the
federal
district
court
in
lincoln,
nebraska
before
judge
warren
urbam
(ph),
all
of
which
is
before
the
court
that
we
then
have
the
total
facts
of
the
case.
but
absent
those
two
evidentiary
hearings
in
march
and
july
of
1974,
before
judge
urbam
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i
think
the
court
would
have
had,
had
it
come
on
direct
review
in
an
inadequate
record
before
it.
so
it
supplemented
then
by
those
evidentiary
hearings
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
they
are,
your
honor.
the
relevant
portions
of
them
from
the,
yes.
dealing
then
with
the
question
of
cognizability
that
the
court
has
asked
us
to
brief
and
argue,
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
whether
habeas
corpus
should
be
available.
this
was
raised
of
course
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
versus
bustamonte
and
there,
when
the
court
--
when
justice
powell
writing
the
concurring
opinion,
cites
in
footnote
16,
professor
amsterdam
on
certain
finality
interests
that
are
to
be
--
that
were
to
be
concerned
with
in
attempting
to
limit
the
federal
collateral
review.
justice
powell,
realizes
of
course
that
professor
amsterdam
was
talking
about
federal
collateral
review
for
federal
prisoners
and
not
state
prisoners
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
right,
and
professor
amsterdam
was
very
careful
i
think
to
make
the
point
that
he
did
not
think
that
those
considerations
need
apply
to
state
prisoners
in
seeking
federal
collateral
review
of
their
claims,
based
upon
federal
constitutional
violations.
the
next
year
in
1965,
professor
amsterdam
wrote
a
considerably
longer
and
exhaustive
article,
criminal
prosecutions
affecting
federally
guaranteed
civil
rights,
discussing
removal
there
and
habeas
corpus
petitions
to
avoid
state
court
actions.
and
i
understand
him
to
argue
from
that
law
review
article
the
need
there
is,
especially
in
state
court
proceedings,
for
some
sort
of
federal
monitoring
at
federal
district
court
and
circuit
court
level
of
the
application
of
federal
constitutional
standard's
defect
situations.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
no,
you
honor,
no.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
1961,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
take
it
that
ever
since
then
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
has
been
followed
and
that
the
circuit
courts
have
consistently
applied
it
and
the
federal
district
courts,
and
so
is
this
court.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
indeed,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
2255.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
would
say,
your
honor,
in
this
court’s
treatment
of
linkletter,
this
court
took
from
the
fifth
circuit
in
1963
a
habeas
corpus
case
and
in
1965,
this
court
took
jurisdiction
in
linkletter
versus
walker
and
decided
the
case
on
its
merits.
this
court
could
not
have
taken
jurisdiction
if
there
had
not
been
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
true
enough.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
true.
but
it
was
a
habeas
corpus
case.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
other
district
courts,
the
district
courts
of
appeal
for
example
in
thornton
versus
the
united
states,
the
district
court
of
columbia
realized
the
distinction
there
was
between
a
federal
prisoner
seeking
federal
review
and
a
state
prisoner,
and
allowing,
in
the
opinion
in
that
court,
that
state
prisoners
should
have
this
device
of
reviewing
a
state
conviction
against
them.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
know
how
sensitive
that
the
court
must
be
to
questions
of
comity
like
that,
and
i
have
read
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
huffman
versus
pursue,
seeing
what
i
could
get
from
it
and
although
i
read
two
paragraphs
and
a
very
careful
footnote,
i
still
could
be
led
to
the
conclusion
that,
your
honor
decided
or
there
writing
for
the
court,
allowed
that
if
indeed
there
would
be
subsequent
criminal
prosecution,
which
at
that
time
was
threatened,
that
if
a
federal
constitutional
claim
was
in
question
that
the
proper
time
to
review
it
would
have
been
in
collateral
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
a
state
court
conviction
later
on,
but
not
to
stop
the
process
before
it
began.
and
so,
i
have
construed
huffman
versus
pursue
to
say
at
least
that.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
true
enough,
but
i
would
think
that
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
state
court's
primary
allegiance
could
be
to
the
enforcement
of
their
own
criminal
law.
they
stand
responsible
to
do
that
and
to
review
questions
of
state
law
and
their
own
criminal
statutes
and
the
imposition
of
them
and
in
matters
that
come
before
them,
correctly
or
not.
but
that
federal
courts
are
to
remove
from
that
if
we
are
to
guarantee
federal
supremacy
of
the
federal
law,
are
better
circumstanced
to
look
dispassionately
upon
a
question
that
might
involve
an
alleged
violation
of
federal
constitutional
standards.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
to
make
such
a
broad
indictment
i
think,
your
honor,
would
be
irresponsible.
i
do
not
want
to
believe
that
a
single
state
court
judge
would
set
out
maliciously
to
deprive
anyone
of
a
state
court
--
of
a
federally
constitution
--
a
federally
guaranteed
constitutional
right.
and
yet,
when
i
look
for
example,
if
this
court
could
refer
to
page
117,
i
believe
of
the
respondents
brief,
we
attempted
to
--
119,
excuse
me,
at
footnote
5,
we
attempted
to
take
the
record
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
nebraska,
in
reviewing
whether
or
not
a
warrant,
search
warrant
was
sufficient
in
a
state
supreme
court.
and
the
court
will
note
there
that
in
a
number
of
occasions,
the
warrant
was
sustained
by
the
state
supreme
court,
that
certiorari
was
denied
on
direct
review
by
this
court
and
that
on
federal
collateral
review,
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
found
the
warrant
to
be
insufficient.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
could
not
argue
that,
your
honor,
but
for
example
from
1961,
post
mapp,
when
i
conducted
that
search
of
cases,
i
find
only
one
time
that
the
state
supreme
court
of
nebraska
held
a
warrant
to
be
insufficient
and
that
was
in
1975
in
state
versus
kelos
(ph),
where
there
was
a
laps
of
nine
months
between
the
facts
alleged
to
establish
probable
cause
in
the
issuance
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
right,
and
that
would
be
difficult
to
find,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
true
enough.
but
for
example,
with
my
new
specificity
in
this
case,
we
see
what
a
state
supreme
court
and
state
lower
court
did
with
a
warrant,
so
wanting
in
probable
causes
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
four
federal
court
judges
in
very
careful
opinions
and
exhausting
--
exhaustive,
painstaking
evidentiary
hearings
to
find
that
there
simply
was
no
basis
for
the
warrant
that
was
based,
quite
frankly
as
the
officer
testified
upon
his
speculation.
that
is
neither
reasonable,
good
faith
nor
probable
cause.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
does
i
think,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
point
before
that
i
was
making
when
i
said
that
i
would
want
the
facts
in
this
case
amplified
by
what
carefully
was
led
out
in
testimonies,
warrant
testimony,
affidavits,
with
an
opportunity
to
cross-examine
in
the
lower
district
court
and
that
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
indeed,
and
then
if
we
are,
your
honor,
to
take
away
federal
habeas
corpus
review
under
2254
at
the
lower
district
court
and
circuit
court
level
and
to
impose
that
duty
upon
an
already
burdened
supreme
court
in
terms
of
direct
review,
add
to
that
an
inadequate
factual
presentation
or
record
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
believe
indeed,
there
was
such
a
hearing
in
this
case,
and
i
believe
that
the
officer,
or
the
impartial
magistrate
who
issued
the
warrant
then
held
a
hearing.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
believe
there
was
preliminary
hearing
and
that
he
had
occasion
to
review
the
warrant
that
he
had
issued.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor
and
i
believe
that
all
stages
of
the
proceedings,
the
lawyers
who
were
then
representing
him
urged
that
motion
to
suppress
and
unsuccessfully.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
certainly
--
were
i
the
state
court
judge
and
knowing
that
some
sort
of
direct
review
was
possible
would
want
to
have
had
a
complete
record,
but
i
submit
that
the
record
was
only
completed
for
one
reason
or
another
and
i
know
not
why
really
when
it
came
to
the
federal
district
court
and
judge
urbam
began
to
ask
questions,
like
the
questions
that
were
answered
very
candidly
at
page
54,
55
and
56
of
the
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
seems
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
your
question
again,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
no.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
no,
not
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
respondent
had
a
right
to
go
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
indeed.
and
did
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
is
true.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
certainly
would
not
happen
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
suppose
one
has
to
think
about
who
conducted
the
hearings
and
the
length
of
time,
the
remove
there
was
from
the
emotive
situation
within
which
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
would
take
it
by
a
motion
to
suppress
you
could
and
if
you
could
have
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
if
you
could
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
suppose
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor
and
i
cannot
be
because
what
accounts
for
the
testimony
then
that
led
to
the
issue
on
the
search
warrant,
which
the
court
has
in
the
appendix
at
page
10,
and
the
subsequent
testimony
of
first
sergeant
fifer
(ph)
and
then
lieutenant,
and
then
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
was
not
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
if
--
the
same
questions
might
be
asked
if
the
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
other
than
what
i
would
say
would
be
the
candor
of
the
officers
who
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
and
said
that
it
was
based
upon
speculation.
it
appears
in
the
search
warrant,
not
upon
speculation,
but
sworn
testimony
furnishing
probable
cause.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor,
but
reviewed
by
a
state
court
not
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
if
--
if
you
had
an
adequate
record
before
you.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
if
they
gave
candid
answers,
your
honor,
yes?
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
perhaps
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
and
the
thoroughness
with
which
he
conducts
an
examination
and
yet
i
note
that
in
answer
to
a
question,
by
judge
urbam,
the
officer
who
had
before
furnished
the
information,
which
led
to
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant
said
in
answer
to
this
question;
“did
you
have
any
report
from
anyone
that
dwaine
peek
was
then
inside
the
rice
house
or
had
been
inside
the
rice
house
that
day”
and
this
is
at
page
54,
his
answer,
“no
sir,
the
only
thing
we
had
was
a
speculation
because
it
was
a
known
house
of
that
particular
group
and
he
was
a
member
of
that
group
and
it
was
a
place
where
he
might
possibly
be.”
that
is
a
wanting
in
good
faith,
reasonableness
or
probable
cause
that
i
think
it
took
everyone
by
surprise
at
that
hearing.
whether
or
not
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
might
have
been
an
accident
of
history
or
chance
in
this
particular
case,
but
nonetheless
upon
questioning,
that
answer
was
elicited
from
this
officer.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
page
54,
your
honor,
the
respondent’s
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
the
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
[laughter]
and
elicited
that
question
and
that
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
we
do
not
and
we
would
have
to
speculate
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
would,
if
sitting
where
you
were,
be
terribly
worried
that
i
would
have
inadequate
records
before
me,
that
already
pressed
by
work
that
will
be
pressed
by
more
work,
that
i
might,
by
a
decision,
take
up
jurisdiction
that
has
been
given
by
the
constitution
to
congress,
that
i
would
have
to
make
a
break
with
four
or
five
decisions
passed
on
by
this
court
and
relied
upon
by
countless
litigants
and
that
anything
so
cataclysmic
changing
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
could
be
better
be
done
by
well
considered
program
legislation
dealing
with
all
those
things.
if
congress
wants
to
change
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
hearing,
in
lower
federal
courts,
this
court,
congress
and
the
constitution
seems
to
guarantee
and
has
up
until
this
point,
then
it
should
be
done
by
congress
that
this
court
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
would
not
say
that.
i
would
say
in
answer
to
that
you
have
touched
upon
the
point
raised
initially
in
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth,
which
is,
is
there
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence.
the
state
of
nebraska
has
said
that
no
claim,
much
less
colorable,
had
ever
been
made
by
the
defendant,
the
respondent
in
this
case
in
any
real
way.
that
has
been
a
matter
of
tremendous
concern
to
him
and
to
his
lawyers.
justice
powell,
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
says,
at
page
257,
that
guilt
or
innocence
had
never
been
part
of
the
consideration,
the
proper
consideration
in
granting
habeas
corpus
or
not
and
at
page
115
and
116
of
the
respondent’s
brief,
we
discussed
that
your
repeated
attempts,
and
especially
in
the
fourth
footnote
at
those
pages,
the
repeated
attempts
by
the
defendant
to
claim
his
innocence,
there
is
in
the
record
before
this
court
a
confession
to
that
suitcase
bombing
by
dwaine
peek,
who
later
recanted
his
confession
and
then
named
david
rice
and
edward
poindexter
who
happened
to
be
the
president
and
minister
of
information
of
the
local
black
panther
party.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
and
he
at
that
time
was
under
first
degree
murder
charges
and
subsequent
to
the
trial
saying
that
no
deal
had
been
made,
was
treated
as
a
juvenile
delinquent
and
has
not
been
seen
since.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
understand,
i
am
familiar
with
from
people
versus
defore,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
the
man
is
not
to
be
imprisoned
if
the
trial
at
which
he
was
tried
was
wanting
in
federal
constitutional
guarantees,
if
the
trial
was
unfair.
in
july
of
1974,
the
district
court
in
lincoln
said
that
he
must
be
retried
or
let
go
within
90
days.
all
of
those
mandates
were
stated
by
the
eight
circuit,
the
eight
circuit
court
affirmed,
and
so
for
19
months,
so
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
has
been
granted
and
we
know
that
this
man
has
in
the
judgment
of
four
federal
court
judges
have
been
tried
unfairly,
that
the
issue
then
innocence
is
still
open.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
parts
ii
and
iii
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
it
is
traditionally
created
of
course,
your
honor,
and
it
gives
effect
to
the
fourth
amendment.
i
believe
it
is
compelled.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
if
congress
is
going
to
take
it
away
procedurally
by
denying
federal
habeas
corpus,
then
i
think
that
that
is
for
congress
to
do.
but
i
think
that
for
example,
when
a
court
allows
evidence
to
be
placed
before
it,
that
they
know
has
been
seized
in
contravention
of
the
constitution,
that
we
approach
something
very
much
like
shelly
versus
kramer
(ph),
that
the
court
--
that
the
state,
if
it
be
a
state
prosecution,
is
in
some
way
in
complicity
in
allowing
illegal
activity
to
be
become
the
basis
for
a
prosecution.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
as
a
general
proposition,
yes.
but
even
in
the
fact--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
think
that
is
the
only
realistic
thing
because
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
unless
it
be
shelly
versus
kramer,
in
which
we
do
not
want
the
court
acting
through
its
judicial
arm
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
but
this
court
has
a
notion
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
and
then
the
decisions
in
katz
begin
to
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
would
think
so.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
right,
indeed
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
codefendant,
david
rice
has
sought
now
unsuccessfully
in
the
lower
federal
district
court
before
the
same
judge
warren
urbam,
to
raise
the
point
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
search
and
judge
urbam
has
held
that
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
standing
to
raise
the
issue
over
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
in
a
common
trial
against
him
of
that
evidence
that
was
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
would,
you
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes.
your
honor,
i
would
not
want
to
read
the
fourth
amendment
just
by
itself.
i
would
want
to
include
the
fifth
amendment
as
well
and
say
that
the
fairness
of
the
hearing
is
going
to
be
measured,
not
just
by
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
technical
fourth
amendment
violation,
but
whether
or
not
the
whole
trial,
including
the
introduction
at
the
evidence,
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
people
who
introduce
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
procedural
safeguards
for
due
process
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
or
to
due
process,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
both.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
no,
your
honor.
just
a
straight
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
no,
i
think
their
opinion
as
it
stands
is
perfectly
adequate.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
cannot
see
that
the
introduction
into
evidence
in
any
proceeding,
state
or
federal
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
because
i
regard,
your
honor,
the
totality
of
the
process,
including
the
trial
and
subsequent
appeals,
all
of
them,
whenever
allowed,
to
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
process
to
determine
guilt
or
innocence
and
that
until
that
be,
until
that
course
be
run,
we
do
not
know
whether
we
have
something
that
is
relevant
or
irrelevant
to
that
issue.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
no,
your
honor.
i
would
want
to
say
that
any
legal
proceeding
in
its
best
aspect
is
precisely
a
search
for
truth.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
if
the
subsequent
hearings
had
not
been
held
in
this
case,
and
the
federal
court
had
had
not
had
revealed
to
it
the
real
circumstances
that
lay
behind
the
issuance,
the
application
for
an
issuance
of
the
search
warrant,
we
would
have
no
check
upon
this
whole
procedure
and
i
cannot
believe
that
the
state
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
that
has
happened,
your
honor
and
i
think
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
faced
that
issue
squarely
at
the
end
of
their
opinion
when
they
said
that
we
consider
it
necessary
to
point
out
that
the
record
discloses
a
widespread
search
for
the
suspect
peek
and
poindexter,
which
events
at
least
a
negligent
disregard
by
the
omaha
police
for
constitutional
rights
of
not
only
petitioner,
but
possibly
other
citizens
as
well.
such
a
police
search
is
at
least
reminiscent
of
police
conduct
condemned
in
langeford
versus
gilstone
(ph).
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
think,
your
honor,
they
said
that
though
they
found
evidence,
some
evidence
of
guilt,
the
whole
procedure
because
of
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
on
an
invalid
warrant,
invalidated
the
whole
proceeding
and
that
in
order
to
be
fair,
one
has
to
go
back
and
try
the
case
without
the
introduction
at
the
evidence
--
of
this
illegally
seized
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
entirely
possible
that
that
dynamite
could
have
been
planted.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
could
have
been,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
collaboration
was
necessary
for
an
admitted
accomplice
in
the
murder,
dwaine
peek
and
collaboration
was
found
in
what
later
proved
to
be,
according
to
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
an
illegal
and
unconstitutional
search,
but
it
furnished
the
collaboration
for
the
state
court
in
affirming
that
conviction.
quite
simply
collaboration
was
needed
for
dwaine
peek
and
it
came
as
the
result
of
an
illegal
search.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
believe,
your
honor,
i
have
to
say
that
they
had
the
power
to
do
that.
would
they
have
to
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
my
question
is
would
they
have
to
amend
the
constitution
to
do
it?
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
right,
right,
i
realize
that
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
which
is,
and
this
court’s
decisions
putting
it
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
[laughter]
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
this
--
other
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
extension
of
the
right
of
privacy
too
in
your
subsequent
decisions.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
as
well
as
other
constitutional
rights
that
we
have
taken
from
the
bill
of
rights,
but
not
mention
specifically
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
the
right
to
privacy,
the
right
to
freedom
of
association,
things
like
that
that
the
court
has
seen
and
interpreted
from
the
constitution.
one
final
thing
i
would
remiss
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
privacy
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
think
in
katz
for
example,
when
we
said
that
the
evidence
might
have
been
tremendously
relevant,
but
there
was
a
rightful
expectation
of
privacy
and
although
there
had
not
been
a
physical
intrusion,
that
right
of
privacy
was
sufficiently
broad
to
be
protected
by
the
introduction
of
admittedly
relevant
evidence
and
so
too
in
this
court’s
decision
in
rochin
versus
california.
everyone
knew
that
he
had
illegally
seized
or
possessed
morphine
in
his
stomach.
it
was
the
way
they
went
about
getting
it
that
shocked
the
conscience
of
the
court
and
led
us
to
say
that
due
process
guarantees
at
least
that
kind
of
a
proceeding
free
from
that
kind
of
taint.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
no
it
should
be,
your
honor,
it
should
be.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
[laughter]
an
unfortunate
distraction,
but
to
leave
them
less
than
wholly
cross-examined
i
think
would
be
sort
of
remiss
too.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
indeed,
the
constitution
i
think
must
continue
to
grow
and
to
be
interpreted.
i
remember,
justice
douglas
in
an
answer,
in
a
colloquy
over
a
paper
called,
“two
faces
of
federalism”
saying
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
describe
due
process,
but
justice
holmes
had
approached
it
one
time,
in
a
letter
not
an
opinion,
in
which
he
said
if
what
happened
generally
makes
you
want
to
vomit
is
usually
a
deprivation
of
due
process
of
law,
but
some
have
stronger
stomachs
than
others.
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
right,
exactly
and
if
medical
science
has
advanced
to
the
point
where
we
can
take
from
a
person
unconscious
a
sample
of
blood
and
achieve
some
sort
of
evidence,
then
perhaps
you
know,
we
had
a
tolerance
for
that
at
time
and
may
not
later.
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
say,
your
honor,
and
i
know
that
we
have
had
ample
time
here,
is
that,
if
this
court
sees
fit
either
to
cut
down
the
extent
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
reach
of
it,
and
if
they
see
fit
or
see
fit
to
adopt
new
rules
for
a
search,
reasonableness,
good
faith
of
the
policemen,
whatever
it
may
be,
if
the
court
does
this,
my
client
must
not
be
penalized
for
taking
the
decisions
that
were
the
law
at
that
time
seriously,
nor
must
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
be
penalized
for
taking
the
decisions
of
this
court
seriously
because
a
proceeding
has
been
conducted
and
to
know
tell
him
at
this
stage
of
the
game
that
he
has
pursued
the
wrong
avenue
--
mr.
william
c.
cunningham
right.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
