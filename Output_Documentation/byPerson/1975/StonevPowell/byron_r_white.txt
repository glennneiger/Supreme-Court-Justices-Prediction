justice
white
i
understand
you
said
re-litigating?
justice
white
well,
what
about
if
it
has
never
been
litigated?
justice
white
i
just
want
to
ask
you,
do
you
want
the
habeas
corpus
statute
now
construed
to
exclude
from
the
power
of
the
federal
court,fourth
amendment
claims
that
have
never
been
litigated
in
the
state
court?
justice
white
well,
supposed
there
were
some
new
information.
assuming
he
was
denied
counsel,
illegally?
justice
white
well,
let
us
assume
he
is
excused
on
some
matter
for
not
having
raised
the
claim
of
the
state
court?
justice
white
do
not
talk
about
re-litigation,
just
say
litigation.
justice
white
but
supposed
the
state
has
a
good
procedure
but
the
judge
--
state
supreme
court
makes
errors.
let
assume
it
denies
him
cross-examination
in
the
suppression
hearing
in
a
manner
that
is
plainly
erroneous.
now,
the
hearing
is
flawed,
let
us
assume
that
it
is
flawed
and
everybody
would
concede
it
was
flawed;
you
would
still
say
that
the
federal
habeas
court
is
close
to
him
or
open?
justice
white
well,
then
what
do
you
about
it?
you
entertain
it
in
the
federal
court,
but
you
will
not
reach
the
fourth
amendment
claim?
justice
white
do
we
independently
reach
a
factual
matter
like
that
if
it
had
not
been
passed
on
by
the
lower
court?
justice
white
yes,
but
that
does
not
get
rid
of
the
issue
we
have
here.
justice
white
that
is
a
constitutional
issue.
justice
white
would
it
that
not
be
a
ground,
in
terry
permitting
that
frisk
was
to
self-protection
of
the
officer
while
he
detained
him
for
a
question?
justice
white
(inaudible)
need
not
consider
the
form
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
agree
on
you
on
that,
we
need
not
consider
the
argument
you
have
just
made
about
modification
of
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
not
need
to
consider
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
fall-back
position
according
to
you?
justice
white
no,
you
make
a
point
in
your
brief
that
makes
it
a
valid
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
(inaudible)
towards,
then
the
fourth
amendment
issue
has
been
once
presented
to
the
state
courts,
it
is
not
--
a
lot
of
states
would
not
let
you
in
their
collateral
proceeding
just
to
take
up
an
issue
that
has
already
been
presented
to
its
courts,
is
not
that
true
in
nebraska?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
suppression
motion
has
been
made
and
the
fourth
amendment
issue
has
been
passed
upon
by
nebraska
trial
court,
and
the
claim
has
been
rejected,
and
that
judgment
was
affirmed
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
state
collateral
proceedings
are
not
then
available,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
for
exhaustion
purposes
it
is
not
necessary
to
attempt
to
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
motion
to
suppress?
excuse
me,
excuse
me,
i
guess
it
depends
on
how
you
--
on
how
you
look
at
the
record
that
has
been
made
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
congress
has
established
some
rule
as
to
when
on
federal
collateral
you
have
a
hearing
and
you
have
to
find
some,
supposedly
find
some
defects
in
the
state
procedure
before
you
proceed
with
the
federal
hearing,
but
if
you
do
find
those
defects
that
is
--
that
is
the
benchmark
for
when
you
have
a
federal
hearing,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
if
this
hearing
had
had
the
same
scope
than
the
state
proceeding,
then
maybe
the
state
supreme
court
would
have
decided
the
case
the
same
way
the
eight
circuit
did?
we
do
not
know,
do
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
hearing
in
the
state
court
and
the
record
made,
and
the
motion
to
suppress
denial
that
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court
is
not
supposed
to
hold
a
hearing
of
its
own,
unless
as
the
statute
requires
it
finds
some
defect
in
state
court
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
defect
did
judge
urbam
found
--
find
in
the
state
court
of
suppression
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
hearing
unless
there
was
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
had
never
been
a
hearing
on
that
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
same
that
he
was,
he
was
--
he
really
cannot
be
saying
that
he
was
retreading
ground
that
the
state
court
had
gone
over
because
it
had
never
gone
over
that
ground?
