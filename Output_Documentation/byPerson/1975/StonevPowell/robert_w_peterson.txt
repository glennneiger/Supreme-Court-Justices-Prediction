mr.
robert
w.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
powell
was
walking
in
an
open
shopping
center
in
henderson,
nevada
on
february
18th
,
1968
when
he
was
approached
by
a
henderson
nevada
police
officer,
asked
a
few
questions
and
then
arrested
under
the
henderson
nevada
ordinance.
that
arrest
was
unreasonable.
it
was
unreasonable
in
the
fourth
amendment
constitutional
sense
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it
was
unreasonable
because
the
police
officer
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
violated
the
ordinance
and
it
was
also
unreasonable
because—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
it
is
a—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
it
is
in
all
the
briefs
in
a
number
of
different
places.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
so.
i
do
not
concede
for
a
moment.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
nevertheless,
i
think
that
is
exactly
true.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
it
is
not
on
that
ground
simply
because
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
that
ground.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
i
suppose
it
might
be
appropriate
if
you
were
to
decide
that
it
is
constitutional
to
arrest
someone
under
an
ordinance
that
authorizes
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
that
this
case
would
have
to
be
sent
back
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
it
does
not
get
rid
of
the
issue
that
we
have
here
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
to
the
going
on
to
the
ordinance.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think,
for
example
that
you
might
well
decide
do
dispose
off
this
case
on
the
probable
cause
grounds
in
order
to
avoid
deciding
a
constitution
issue
because
the
probable
cause
grounds
is
the
narrower
ground.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
mean,
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
law.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
this
case
is
worse
than
the
terry
case.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
in
the
terry
case?
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
he
did
not
run.
when
the
police
approached
him
he
was
walking,
walking
according
to
the
officer
at
a
quick
pace.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
he
was
walking
quickly,
that
is
the
way
the
police
officer
characterized
it.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
quickly
in
a
shopping
center
towards
one
of
the
department
stores.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
believe
it
is
either
terry
or
supron,
i
forgot
which
one
where
the
person
walked
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
stores,
some
25
times.
yes,
some
25
times
back
and
forth
looking
like
he
was
gazing
the
store,
a
number
of
times
in
that
case.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
do
not
think
the
police
officer
in
this
case
did
have
the
right.
but
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
i
would
concede
that
the
way
he
was
walking
would
authorize
the
police
officer
to
make
a
limited
terry
staff.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
he
would
not
have
a
right
to
frisk
him,
because
terry
requires
before
you
can
frisk
him
that
you
have
some
founded
suspicion
that
he
is
armed
and
this
police
officer
did
not
have
any
founded
suspicion,
he
had
none
whatsoever.
and
indeed,
the
attorney
general
has
never
argued
that
there
was
grounds
for
frisk.
he
did
have
a
gun
but
there
was
no
reason
for
the
officer
to
believe
that.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
the
appearance
of
casing
a
place
for
possible
robbery.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
that
is
the
way
robberies
are
usually
committed.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
when
he
thought
that
the
individual
might
have
had
a
gun.
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
frisk
every
person
that
you
can
stop
under
terry.
i
am
sure
this
court
has
never
held
that.
i
think
that
would
be
wrong.
but
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
every
case
there
is
a
right
to
stop,
there
is
a
right
to
a
frisk?
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
because
in
that
case,
the
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
officer
had
was
that
this
person
was
about
to
commit
a
robbery
or
something
which
normally
includes
a
gun
or
some
kind
of
weapon?
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
neither
one
very
valid.
well,
i
think
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
when
they
pointed
out
in
the
case
that
the
attorney
general
makes
no
suggestion
that
there
was
a
right
to
a
terry
type
frisk
because
there
was
no
suspicion
at
all
that
this
person
was
armed
from
whatever
source
that
suspicion
might
come
from.
it
just
was
not
there.
they
just
saw
someone
walking
in
a
shopping
center
and
thought
that
that
was
a
suspicious
person.
in
any
event,
the
ordinance
in
this
case
under
which
he
was
arrested
itself
authorizes
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
because
the
ordinance
allows
a
full
custodial
arrest
for
what
under
terry
at
the
most
would
be
a
brief
detention
and
if
there
was
reasonably,
there
was
a
gun,
a
frisk.
in
this
case,
not
only
can
he
be
arrested
but
he
can
also
be
prosecuted
simply
for
being
a
suspicious
person.
it
also
was
unreasonable
arrest
under
the
ordinance
because
the
ordinance
was
not
clear
enough
to
advise
either
the
police
officer
or
someone
who
is
trying
to
hue
his
conduct
to
the
standards
of
the
ordinance
of
what
the
prescribed
conduct
is.
there
are
other
violations
of
this
ordinance.
the
ordinance
is
also
unconstitutional
because
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
the
ordinance
makes
it
a
crime
in
this
case
for
someone
to
refuse
to
a
suspect,
a
criminal
suspect
to
refuse
to
give
a
narrative
account
to
an
investigating
police
officer
of
his
conduct.
i
think
that
is
a
gross
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
argues
that
the
police
officer
acted
in
good
faith
when
he
arrested
under
this
ordinance
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
good
faith
were
the
standard
at
the
time
that
this
arrest
was
made,
this
could
not
have
been
made
in
good
faith
because
if
either
officer
lauten(ph)
or
the
henderson,
nevada
city
council
had
bothered
to
take
a
look
at
the
law
as
it
existed
at
that
time.
they
would
have
found
cases
beginning
with
boyd
in
1886
and
certainly
they
would
have
found
the
miranda
case
which
requires
a
police
officer
to
advise
someone
that
he
has
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
he
would
have
found
davis
versus
mississippi.
a
case
in
which
this
court
said,
that
while
a
police
officer
may
ask
questions
about
unsolved
crimes,
he
has
no
right
to
compel
answers.
those
cases
were
both
on
the
books
at
the
time
that
this
arrest
was
made
and
i
fail
to
see
how
a
police
officer
who
on
a
daily
basis
advises
people
of
the
miranda
rights
could
possibly
believe
in
the
constitutionality
of
an
ordinance
that
made
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
answer
the
police
officer’s
questions.
the
vagueness
doctrine
was
hardly
a
novel
one
in
1968.
many
of
the
cases
of
this
court
at
that
time
were
vulnerable.
there
is
a
lanzetta
case,
the
cox
case—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
and
whether
or
not
he
should
make
a
search,
i
think
that
that
would
be
attaching
a
penalty
to
the
exercise
of
the
fifth
amendment
right—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
do
not
think
for
his
refusal
to
answer
questions?
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white’s
concurrence
in
that
case
made
it
clear
that
the
officer
has
no
right
to
compel
answers
and
may
not
consider
the
refusal
to
answer.
as
part
of
the
basis
for
the
probable
cause,
that
attaches
an
undue
penalty
on
the
exercise
of
your
constitutional
right
not
to
incriminate
yourself.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
or
perhaps
walking
up
and
down
with
an
apparent
plan
to
rob
a
place
is
not
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
oh,
i
think
terry
did.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
because
his
conduct
was
consistent,
i
think
this
was
the
proper
reading
of
terry,
consistent
with
the
possibility
that
he
was
armed.
i
do
not
think
that
every
police
officer
who
has
a
right
to
stop
someone
has
a
right
to
frisk
him.
i
do
not
think
every
police
officer
who
pulls
someone
over
for
a
traffic
violation
has
the
right
to
frisk
them
unless
there
are
some
founded
beliefs
that
the
person
might
also
have
a
weapon.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
the
police
officer
has
a
right
to
require
the
suspect
to
answer
his
questions?
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
or
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
full
custodial
arrest,
i
think
that
is
right
if
you
are
going
to
take
the
person
down
to
the
jail.
well,
then
you
do
have
a
right
and
i
suppose
that
that
is
the
basis
for
the
search
in
this
case.
he
was
being
arrested
for
vagrancy
and
since
he
was
now
going
to
be
taken
to
jail,
then
he
could
be
searched.
but
that
arrest
was
unconstitutional
for
the
reasons
that
i
am
outlining
and
so
that
search
has
to
fall.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
so.
i
think
the
police
officer
has
a
right
to
ask
the
question
but—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
do
not
think
he
has
the
right
to
demand
answers
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
he
was
arrested
because
in
the
officer’s
view,
he
had
refused
to
answer.
that
is
the
element
of
the
crime—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
i
think
that
the
attorney—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
he
is
on
his
way
to
michigan.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
he
could
not
remember
the
names.
as
one
of
the
witnesses
could
not
remember
where
he
was
staying
when
he
testified
at
his
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
i
think
the
attorney
general
is
in
the
dilemma
because
the
critical
element
of
the
offense
is
refuse
to
identify
yourself
and
account
for
your
presence.
now,
either
he
was
not
asked
to
account.
i
do
not
think
he
was.
he
was
never
asked
why
he
was
walking
the
way
he
was
in
the
shopping
center,
in
which
case
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
or
he
refused
to
answer,
in
which
case
he
was
arrested
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right
that
he
has
or
he
did
not
refuse,
he
accounted.
in
which
case,
there
is
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
oh
yes,
he
did
identify
himself
though
he
gave
his
true
name
and
he
gave
his
birthday.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no
written
identification
but
the
henderson,
nevada
ordinance
does
not
require
that.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
would
take
that
position
that
he
has
no
right
to
require
that
answer,
and
so
he
cannot
attach
a
penalty
to
it
and
the
penalty
would
be
search.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
not
exactly,
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
you
cannot
attach
a
penalty
to
silence.
in
griffin
versus
california
could
not
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right
but
in
davis
versus
mississippi
it
was
not
and
in
mr.
justice
white’s
concurrence
in
terry
against
ohio,
it
was
not.
i
would
say
that
that
is
an
undue
price
to
exact
for
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right.
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent.
you
cannot
penalize
that.
that
will
be
my
position.
in
this
case—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
a
privilege
to
remain
silent.
again,
the
police
officer
had
consulted
the
law
in
1968
on
the
issue
of
good
faith
or
the
henderson,
nevada
city
council
had
done
that,
they
also
would
have
found
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
1931
had
held
unconstitutional
a
hawaiian
ordinance
that
it
made
it
unlawful
to
loathe,
loiter
or
idle.
and
that
ordinance
was
held
unconstitutional
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
undoubtedly
be
enforced
discriminatorily
and
it
penalized
the
constitutional
right
to
wander
around.
something
you
have
a
right
to
do
in
the
united
states.
if
he
looked
further,
they
would
have
found
the
federal
cases
that
had
struck
down
good
account
and
satisfactory
account
statutes
of
baker
versus
bender
and
united
states
versus
margison
had
struck
those
down
in
1966
and
1967.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
had
struck
down
a
similar
statute
and
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
in
1967,
held
unconstitutional
an
ordinance
that
read
as
follows,
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
wandering
or
loitering
abroad
or
brought
under
other
suspicious
circumstances
from
1-1/2
hour
after
sunset
to
1-1/2
hour
before
sunrise
to
fail
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
themselves
upon
the
demand
of
any
police
officer.
that
was
on
the
books
at
that
time.
i
suggest
is
a
more
narrowly
drawn
ordinance
than
the
one
that
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
that
that
is
the
attorney
general’s
position.
the
attorney
general’s
position
and
they
set
it
forth
on
page
4
of
their
brief
is
that
the
officer’s
belief
and
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
must
be
in
good
faith.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
if
this
ordinance
authorizes
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
then
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
his
duty.
i
think
that
he
should
enforce
the
ordinance
if
it
is
on
the
books
and
then
it
will
be
declared
unconstitutional
in
a
suppression
hearing
or
in
a
prosecution
and
after
that,
it
will
no
longer
enforce
the
ordinance.
i
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
does
that
the
police
officer
should
exercise
his
own
judgment
as
to
the
constitutionality
or
unconstitutionality
of
the
laws.
i
think
that
is
an
unworkable
rule.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
as
of
right
now?
this
ordinance
has
not
been
declared
unconstitutional
except
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
right
now,
he
would
enforce
it
unless
he
was
told
by
the
superiors
not
to.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
am
not
sure,
i
follow
that.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
i
think
that
they
just
did
not
know
that
it
was
invalid
and
until
this
court
rules,
they
do
not
know,
for
sure,
in
the
sense
that
we
have
a
case
right
squarely
on
point
that
it
is
invalid.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right
but
this
court
has
taken
that
case
and
so
it
is
in
somewhat
of
the
state
of
limbo.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
he
might
have
taken
that
for
that
reason
but
one
of
the
questions
which
you
granted
certiorari
on
was
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
we
have
the
ninth
circuit’s
answer
and
i
think
we
are
going
to
have
this
court’s
answer,
i
hope.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
i
do
not
think
i
lose
at
all
because
the
police
officer
do
not
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
under
it
even
though
it
is
assumed
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
in
which
case,
i
think
that
the
only
thing
the
court
should
do
then
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
get
their
judgment
if
this
court
chooses
not
to
make
that
judgment
itself.
i
would
hope
you
would
not
do
that.
this
case
has
been
going
for
7-1/2
years
now.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
a
full
custodial
arrest?
no,
not
if
there
is
a
founded
suspicion
that
the
person
is
armed,
i
think.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
or
you
could
view
terry
as
a
case
allowing
a
limited
kind
of
arrest.
you
can
look
at
it
either
way,
the
brief
detention
is
a
limited
arrest
but
it
is
not
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
briefly
detain
and
also
pat
down
if
there
is
a
founded
suspicion
that
the
person
might
be
armed
because
the
officer
has
a
right
to
protect
themselves.
that
is
the
way
i
would
read
terry.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
the
particular
officer?
that
is
right
because
there
was
a
founded
suspicion
that
he
might
be
armed.
i
do
not
think
you
could
pat
down
anyone
that
you
had
a
right
to
ask
a
question.
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
terry
holds.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
he
has
a
cause
of
action
against
the
officer
for
arresting
him
without
probable
cause.
he
has
no
remedy
against
the
henderson,
nevada
city
council
for
adapting
an
ordinance
which
in
effect
commands
the
police
to
make
unreasonable
arrest
and
commands
and
them
to
violate
the
fifth
amendment
rights
of
people
who
were
walking
around
in
henderson
--
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
not
if
the
only
reason
that
the
arrest
is
unconstitutional
was
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
ordinance
then
he
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
against
the
officer.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
there
is
no
cause
of
action
either
against
the
police
officer
under
pierson
against
ray.
i
think
that
is
the
case
or
against
the
legislature
because
the
legislature
enjoys
legislative
immunity.
but
there
is
fundamental
problem
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
the
people
shall
be
secure
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
court
adapt
the
view
that
that
focus
is
solely
on
the
police
and
that
a
legislative
body
may
command
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
so
long
as
the
police
officer
is
relying
on
that
legislative
command
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
but
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
say
that
people
shall
be
secure
only
from
searches
and
seizure
conceived
by
the
police.
i
think
that—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
oh
no,
but
there
is
no
question
of
this
being
an
arrest
by
a
private
person
here.
this
is
an
arrest
by
a
police
officer
based
on
legislation,
state
law.
and
i
think—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
that
is
the
way
it
has
to
be
because
the
legislature
does
not
go
out
and
make
the
searches
itself.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
if
i
command
someone
to
commit
a
crime
on
my
behalf,
then
i
cannot
say
that
well,
i
did
not
do
it
and
so
i
am
not
responsible
and
i
think
that
is
the
position
that
the
attorney
general
is
urging
the
court
to
adapt.
and
i
think
that
has
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
almeida-sanchez
and
brignoni-ponce
cases
decided
just
last
term
where
the
immigration
officers
were
relying
in
complete
good
faith
and
indeed
there
was
unanimity
among
the
lower
courts
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
what
they
were
doing
in
making
fixed
checkpoint
stops
and
roving
stops
and
nevertheless
the
evidence
in
those
cases
was
suppressed.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
on
issue
of
retroactivity
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
to
cases
other
than
the
first
case
that
is
brought
to
this
court.
this
is
the
first
case
with
respect
to
this
ordinance
where
there
has
been
an
arrest
under
--
this
has
been
brought
to
this
court
whether
or
not
to
apply
this
case
retroactively
and
other
decisions,
i
think
he
has
wait
until
those
cases
come
along.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
it
is
a
factor
in
the
next
case.
the
next
case
that
comes
along
where
someone
else
is
arrested
under
the
same
ordinance,
certain
ordinance
which
is
drafted
in
substantially
the
same
terms
and
this
court
has
said,
and
how
you
cannot
make
arrest
under
those
ordinances.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
that
since
the
constitution
says
that
you
shall
be
secure
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
that
you
cannot
look
just
at
the
agent
who
was
then
commanded
to
make
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
by
the
legislature.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
i
think
the
only
consideration
the
court
should
give
to
the
existence
of
that
ordinance
is
the
normal
kind
of
presumption
that
the
court
gives
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
law
until
it
is
declared
unconstitutional.
but
if
that
is
an
unconstitutional
ordinance
then
i
think
in
this
case,
the
evidence
is
going
to
have
to
be
suppressed.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
am
with
you.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
did
it
say
that
the
nevada
court
was
wrong
in
the
same
case
that
the
nevada
court
has
said
that
it
was
right
then
it
would
invalidate
the
arrest?
if
it
were
a
different
case
it
would
not.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
the
only
way
in
the
first
case
to
get
to
this
court—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
it
is
either
reasonable
or
unreasonable
but
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can
rely
on
how
this
court
is
going
to
rule
until
this
court
has
ruled.
and
that
nevada
supreme
court—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
then
it
would
not
be
reasonable.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
he
cannot
get
to
declaratory
judgment
in
the
case
like
this
because
he
do
not
have
standing
under
ellis
versus
dyson.
well,
i
think,
you
have
to
eventually
--
a
case
is
probably
going
to
have
to
end
up
in
this
court
if
there
is
serious
doubt
about
the
reasonableness
of
it
as
this
case
has.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
you
cannot
do
it
that
way—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
that
this
court
has
struck
that
balance
in
its
retroactivity
decisions.
in
the
brignoni-ponce
and
almeida-sanchez
cases,
many
people
had
been
arrested
and
searched
pursuant
to
the
federal
statutes
on
those
cases
and
this
court
in
peltier
decided
not
to
reverse
those
but
this
court
did
and
the
case
that
came
here
reversed
that
decision.
and
i
think
that
is
the
way
the
balance
has
been
struck.
it
will
not
be
applied
retroactively
most
likely
but
it
has
to
be
applied
in
this
case
since
this
is
the
first
case
to
get
here.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
i
think—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
until
it
gets
here
and
it
is
declared
invalid
and
once
it
gets
here,
it
is
like
almeida-sanchez
and
brignoni-ponce.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
it
did.
i
have
suggested
at
that
time
the
ordinance
was
also
invalid
because
or
he
had
no
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
it
was
valid
because
there
was
a
welter
of
cases
on
the
books
even
then
suggesting
it
is
invalid.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
to
use
a
phrase
has
been
used
before
that
as
a
fall
back
position,
i
am
not
conceding
that
his
good
faith
should
be
the
test
but
i
am
saying
that
that
is
the
test,
that
this
court
adapts
the
attorney
genera’s
position
then
this
officer
could
not
have
had
good
faith
because
of
the
plethora
of
cases
were
on
the
books
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
that
of
course
has
not
been
completely
resolved
by
this
court
in
pierson
against
ray.
i
would
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
damages
against
the
police
officer,
the
court
might
well
take
the
position
that
he
could
hide
behind
the
shield
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
one
reason.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity
is
another
reason,
that
is
a
vague
concept
but
i
rather
like
the
suggestion
that
the
shelley
against
kraemer
approach
when
a
court
accepts
illegally
seized
evidence,
it
is
effectuating
an
unconstitutional
act
in
the
same
way
that
in
shelley
versus
kraemer,
the
court
was
effectuating
the
racially
discriminatory
covenants
by
enforcing
those
covenants.
i
think
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
those
are
two
reasons.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes,
that
also.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
think
that
has
to
be
the
rule
because
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
you
shall
be
secure
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
be
secured
if
the
legislature
can
tell
the
police,
do
as
you
please.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
oh,
i
certainly
do
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
it
is
not
going
to
be
held
invalid
unless
you
have
a
suppression
hearing
and
it
is
held
invalid
at
the
suppression
hearing.
if
it
can
only
be
held
invalid
in
a
prosecution
then
the
district
attorney
is
going
to
refrain
from
prosecuting
because
of
the
clear
unconstitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
that
way,
he
will
protect
searches
and
seizures
that
are
made
under
it.
there
cannot
be
a
declaratory
judgment
action
because
that
is
trammeled
up
with
the
article
3
requirements,
standing
requirements
that
now
allow
only
a
very
narrow
group
to
anticipate
by
going
into
court
and
attacking
the
ordinance
in
ellis
against
dyson.
this
court’s
case
from
last
term
is
a
very
good
example
of
that.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
there
may
be
a
difference.
it
is
not
going
to
be
different
in
every
case
but
the—
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right
and
this
is
a
good
example.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
certainly
true
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
he
is
already
on
parole.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
not
in
the
sense
that
we
rare
only
deterring
officer
lauten(ph),
these
laws
are
still
on
the
books
today
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
california
has
an
identical
disorderly
conduct
statute
which
is
being
enforced
today
in
california.
and
if
i
understand
the
deterrence
rationale
for
the
suppression
doctrine,
it
is
to
deter
other
law
enforcement
people
including
other
legislative
bodies
from
unreasonable
searching.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
the
deterrence
is
that
you
tell
the
legislature
today.
right
now,
that
these
laws
are
no
good.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
that
is
right.
well,
once
this
court
has
declared
the
ordinance
to
be
constitutional
and
i
would
hope
and
trust
that
state
courts
would
not
continue
to
keep
the
person
incarcerated
and
a
motion
to
suppress
would
be
sustained.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
by
a
state
court,
after
this
court
has
given
its
guidance
as
to
unconstitutionality
of
the
ordinance
and
the
appropriate
application
of
the
suppression
doctrine
when
arrest
is
made
in
reliance
on
an
unconstitutional
law.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
i
think
that
is
true
but
this
court
does
proceed
on
principle
and
it
announces
principles
which
can
be
applied
with
a
fair
degree
of
certainty
to
fairly
similar
situations.
although
it
is
easy
to
pose,
redrafting
these
ordinances
in
any
number
of
ways
to
make
them
arguably
constitutional
in
spite
of
what
this
court
has
said.
the
next
ordinance
might
say,
tramp
about
or
it
might
say,
saunter,
or
it
might
use
some
other
equally
vague
words
so
that
they
could
argue
that
the
powell
case
does
not
quite
fit
this
case.
i
can
only
hope
that
this
court’s
decisions
would
be
applied
in
good
faith
by
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
certainly
as
a
ground
as
to
make
someone
a
criminal.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
but
they
did
not
make
someone
a
criminal
for
that
and
they
did
not
authorize
a
full
custodial
arrest
for
simply
being
suspicious.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
i
authorized
a
pat-down
where
there
was
founded
suspicion
that
the
person
might
be
armed
for
the
protection
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
to
this
court?
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
no,
it
was
presented
last
year
in
lefkowitz
versus
newson
but
this
court
did
not
take
it.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
well,
i
think
it
is
interesting
that
this
ordinance
has
been
presented
to
this
court
in
a
number
of
other
direct
appeal
cases
in
people
versus
solomon
and
i
think
people
versus
wager
coming
from
california
and
this
court
did
not
take
the
case
and
yet
here
it
is
now
in
the
suppression
ordinance.
mr.
robert
w.
peterson
thank
you.
