mr.
robert
r.
granucci
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
which
in
effect
orders
the
setting
aside
of
respondents,
california
conviction
of
second-degree
murder.
the
murder
took
place
in
san
bernardino,
late
in
the
evening
of
february
17,
1968.
respondent
lloyd
charles
powell
with
three
companions
entered
a
liquor
store
owned
by
gerald
and
mary
parsons.
while
one
of
the
group
was
making
a
small
purchase,
respondent
was
observed
in
the
act
of
shoplifting
a
half
gallon
of
wine.
he
struck
mr.
parsons
in
the
mouth
with
his
fist,
a
fighting
shoot.
during
the
struggle,
respondent
took
mr.
parsons’
revolver
from
in
and
fired
two
shots.
the
first
struck
mr.
parsons
in
the
arm
wounding
him.
the
second
struck
mrs.
parsons
just
below
the
neck,
punctured
her
lung
and
resulted
in
her
death
the
following
morning.
the
town
of
henderson,
nevada
is
located
approximately
180-airline
miles
northeast
of
san
bernardino
and
8
miles
southeast
of
las
vegas.
shortly
after
10
a.m.
on
the
morning
after
the
shooting,
henderson
police
officer
edward
lauten(ph)
while
on
routine
patrol
observed
two
men
walking
across
the
parking
lot
of
a
shopping
center.
one
of
the
two
was
the
respondent.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
approximately
10
a.m.
in
the
morning
your
honor.
as
soon
as
the
two
saw
the
police
car,
they
turned
about
and
started
rapidly
in
the
direction
they
had
been
coming
from.
when
officer
lauten(ph)
made
a
u-turn
and
started
to
approach
them,
the
two
split
up.
officer
lauten(ph)
honked
his
horn.
respondent
kept
walking
rapidly
towards
the
rear
of
the
department
store.
finally,
officer
lauten(ph)
got
out
and
ordered
respondent
to
stop.
officer
lauten(ph)
asked
respondent
for
some
identification.
he
replied
that
his
identification
papers
had
been
stolen.
he
did
give
the
officer
his
name
and
date
of
birth.
the
officer
then
radioed
for
a
warrant’s
check
which
came
back
negative.
respondent
told
the
officer
he
had
been
staying
with
friends
in
las
vegas
for
the
past
few
days
but
he
did
not
give
their
names
and
he
did
not
know
their
address.
he
stated
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
michigan.
the
officer
also
tended
to
disbelieve
this
because
the
most
direct
route
from
las
vegas
to
points
east
does
not
pass
through
henderson.
a
local
ordinance
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
for
a
person
to
loiter
without
apparent
reason
or
business,
and
to
refuse
to
identify
himself
and
to
account
for
his
presence
when
asked
by
a
peace
officer
to
do
so.
when
the
surrounding
circumstances
would
indicate
to
a
reasonable
man
that
the
public
safety
demand
such
identification.
officer
lauten(ph)
arrested
respondent
for
violating
that
ordinance.
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest
turned
up
the
murder
weapon.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
on
this
person,
your
honor.
the
respondent’s
trial
in
june
1968
in
the
san
bernardino
county
superior
court,
the
revolver
was
admitted
into
evidence
after
the
trial
judge
had
heard
and
denied
respondent’s
motion
to
suppress
it
as
the
product
of
an
illegal
search.
the
jury
subsequently
found
respondent
guilty
of
second-degree
murder.
respondent
appealed
his
conviction.
one
of
his
contentions
was
that
his
arrest
and
the
incidental
search
were
illegal
because
the
henderson
vagrancy
ordinance
was
unconstitutional.
in
october
1969,
the
california
court
of
appeal
affirmed
the
conviction
holding
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
search
point
because
admission
of
the
revolver
into
evidence,
even
if
it
were
error
would
not
have
affected
the
verdict.
respondent
did
not
seek
a
hearing
in
the
california
supreme
court.
however,
he
did
subsequently
apply
to
that
court
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
his
petition
was
denied.
in
august
1971,
state
remedies
having
been
exhausted.
respondent
filed
an
amended
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
that
court
issued
an
order
to
show
cause.
after
receiving
briefs
and
examining
the
record
of
the
state
trial,
the
district
court
denied
the
writ
in
february
1972.
significantly,
in
its
order
denying
the
writ,
the
district
court
declared
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
be
advanced
by
ex
post
facto
condemnation
of
an
arrest
which
was
apparently
valid
when
made.
and
the
facts
developed
at
petitioner’s
trial
show
that
the
arresting
officer
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
had
observed
the
petitioner
violate
the
ordinance.on
december
4,
1974,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
ostensibly,
directing
further
proceedings
in
conformity
with
this
opinion
but
actually
ordering
the
writ
granted
and
petitioner
released.
excuse
me
your
honor,
respondent
released.
its
opinion,
a
triumph
of
logic
over
justice
reasoned
as
follows.
under
proper
crystal,
the
city
of
jacksonville,
the
henderson
vagrancy
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
therefore
respondent’s
arrest
was
illegal.
therefore
the
revolver
found
in
the
incidental
search
was
illegally
obtained
evidence.
second,
that
the
arresting
officer
acted
reasonably
and
in
good
faith
as
of
no
moment.
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case
is
appropriate
to
preserve
judicial
integrity
and
to
deter
legislative
bodies
from
enacting
unconstitutional
statutes.
admission
of
the
revolver
was
not
harmless
error,
therefore,
respondents;
california
murder
conviction
must
be
set
aside.
thus,
the
question
before
this
court
in
this
case
is—
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
your
honor
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record
below.
i
think
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
when
the
officer
found
the
revolver
in
the
incidental
search,
he
forgot
all
about
the
vagrancy
ordinance
and
continued
to
process
and
book
respondent
for
the
more
serious
charge
of
carrying
a
concealed
weapon.
but
that
is
simply
an
assumption
i
make.
there
are
questions
before
this
court
though—
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
your
honor
although
a
defendant
in
california
is
in
entitled
to
move
for
bail
pending
appeal.
the
granting
of
that
motion
is
just
discretionary
and
ordinarily
a
defendant
sentence
for
murder
begins
to
serve
his
sentence
as
soon
as
the
judgment
is
pronounced
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
for
decision
is
whether
a
california
murderer
is
to
go
free
on
federal
habeas
corpus
because
he
was
arrested
under
a
nevada
ordinance
which
may
have
violated
a
decision
of
this
court
handed
down
two
years
after
the
conviction
became
final,
four
years
after
the
arrest
and
more
significantly
more
than
four
years
after
the
ordinance
was
adapted.
the
question
specified
by
this
court
in
its
order
granting
review
namely
whether
in
light
of
the
fact
that
officer
lauten(ph)
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
respondent
for
violation
of
an
ordinance
which
at
that
time
had
not
been
authoritatively
declared
unconstitutional.
respondents
claim
based
on
the
search
incident
of
that
arrest
is
one
cognizable
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
invites
a
preliminary
inquiry
that
is
even
more
fundamental,
that
is,
whether
fourth
amendment
claims
of
state
prisoners
should
be
cognizable
at
all
in
such
proceedings.
we
raised
this
very
question
in
schneckloth
versus
bustamante
and
justice
powell
treated
it
in
his
concurring
opinion.
today
we
ask
the
court
to
adopt
justice
powell’s
analysis.
rather
than
simply
restating
the
basic
argument
presented
in
that
case,
that
the
cost
to
society
involved
in
re-litigating
fourth
amendment
claims
on
federal
habeas
corpus
outweigh
any
benefits
to
be
gained
thereby,
we
present
an
additional
consideration.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
re-litigate
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
then,
your
honor,
the
petitioner
would
be
faced
with
two
inquiries
that
were
even
more
fundamental
and
would
be
dispositive,
whether
he
had
failed
to
exhaust
state
remedies
or
whether
he
had
bypassed
procedure
in
the
state
court.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
your
honor.
where
there
has
been
a
fair
procedure
available
to
litigate.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
where
he
had
the
opportunity.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
and
could
not
litigate
the
claim
for
that
reason?
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
our
position
is
such
claims
should
not
be
available
at
all.
a
denial
of
counsel
would
work—
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
litigated.
i
will
accept
that.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
it
should
not
be
cognizable,
open
for
consideration.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
a
personal
due
process
right
available
to
a
defendant
by
its
own
force.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
your
honor.
but
habeas
corpus—
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
where
the
state
provides
an
adequate
procedure
for
the
vindication
of
these
claims,
they
should
not
be
available
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
habeas
corpus
is
a
remedy
for
the
vindication
of
personal
rights.
this
is
clear
from
fay
v.
noia
which
says
today’s
habeas
corpus
provides
a
mode
for
the
redress
of
denials
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
would
be
a
due
process
error
that
occurred
during
a
state
proceeding.
that
claim
of
denial
of
cross-examination
on
a
material
issue
in
the
state
court.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
the
proper
remedy,
your
honor,
would
be
to
send
it
back
for
another
suppression
hearing
in
the
state
court
where
he
would
have
his
right
to
cross-examination.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
precisely.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think,
i
think
that
such
claims
ought
to
be
promptly
raised.
there
should
not
be
a
bypass
of
state
remedies.
there
should
be
exhaustion.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fay
v.
noia,
this
court
said
vindication
of
due
process
is
precisely
the
historic
office
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
but
the
historic
office
of
the
exclusionary
rule
on
the
other
hand
is
entirely
different.
this
court
has
thoroughly
discredited
the
notion
that
the
defendant
has
a
personal
right
to
the
exclusion
of
evidence.
in
united
states
v.
calandra
and
united
states
v.
peltier,
the
court
has
stated
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
judicially
created
remedy
designed
to
safeguard
fourth
amendment
rights
generally
through
its
deterrent
effect
rather
than
a
personal
constitutional
right
of
the
party
agreed.
the
exclusionary
rule
furthers
a
general
societal
interest
rather
than
a
personal
right.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
up
to
this
point
have
tended
to
blur
the
notions
of
constitutional
rights
and
personal
rights.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
so.
i
think
so,
although
the
theory
of
mapp
v.
ohio
as
i
understand
it
is
this.
the
constitution
requires
an
exclusionary
rule
that
can
be
asserted
at
trial
in
order
to
discourage
the
police
from
making
unlawful
searches.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
the
fact
that
it
is
constitutionally
required
does
not
mean
that
it
must
be
applied
at
all
stages.
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
required
on
collateral
attack.
i
think
this
is
clear
from
united
states
versus
calandra.
john
calandra’s
rights
were
arguably
violated
by
an
illegal
search.
but
the
violation
of
that
constitutional
right
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
had
a
personal
right
to
assert
the
exclusionary
rule
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings.
in
determining
whether
mr.
calandra
was
entitled
to
make
a
suppression
motion
to
challenge
evidence
which
was
being
considered
by
the
grand
jury
and
which
was
being
used
to
formulate
questions
asked
to
him.
this
court
balanced
the
negative
impact
of
allowing
suppression
there
in
the
form
of
an
undue
interference
with
the
functioning
of
the
grand
jury
against
any
positive
effects
that
application
of
the
rule
would
have
in
further
deterring
unlawful
searches
keeping
in
mind
that
the
evidence
would
be
inadmissible
at
trial.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
came
from
calandra
and
it
was
quoted
in
peltier.
of
course
the
disadvantages
of
allowing
state
prisoners
to
raise
fourth
amendment
claims
on
federal
habeas
corpus
have
been
recounted
before.
i
simply
touch
on
them.
this
practice
texas
cares
judicial
and
prosecutorial
resources.
it
causes
frictions
between
the
federal
and
state
courts
whose
decisions
are
second-guessed.
it
undermines
public
confidence
in
the
administration
of
justice
by
the
litigation
of
matters
years
after
the
fact
that
bear
no
relationship
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
and
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
any
idea
of
rehabilitating
criminal
offenders.
in
the
words
of
professor
paul
butler,
the
idea
of
just
condemnation
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
criminal
law
and
we
should
not
likely
create
processes
which
implicitly
belie
its
possibility.
at
this
point,
it
may
be
suggested
that
we
have
proved
too
much
that
the
disadvantages
of
collateral
attack
are
so
great
that
no
constitutional
right
should
be
available
once
a
conviction
has
become
final
as
a
basis
for
habeas
corpus.
however,
where
personal
rights
are
involved
balancing
is
inappropriate.
but
where
a
societal
right
is
involved
and
where
a
defendant
has
no
personal
right
to
the
exclusion
of
evidence
then
he
should
be
permitted
to
invoke
the
rule
only
where
it
will
actually
serve
to
deter
on
lawful
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no,
i
think
history
would
argue
exactly
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
right.
but
your
honor,
mr.
calandra’s
rights
were
violated
by
that
search.
but
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
he
had
the
right
to
make
a
suppression
motion.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
simply
a
judicially
created
doctrine
to
further
the
protection
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
if
it
has
been
exerted
prior
to
trial,
the
right
is
not
completely
violated
until
either
the
confession
or
its
fruits
are
admitted
in
the
trial.
remember
the
fifth
amendment
is
about
testimonial
consumption.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
but
the
defendant
has
no
personal
right
to
the
suppression
of
evidence.
it
is
not
what
the
defendant
feels.
it
is
the
remedy
that
the
court
makes
available.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
that
right
is
not
violated
so
until
the
evidence
is
admitted
at
trial
because
the
fifth
amendment
is
uniquely
a
trial
right.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
societal
and
systemic,
i
think
mean
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
no.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
well,
that
is
one
distinction
that
has
been
drawn
between
statements
and
physical
evidence.
but
i
think
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stevens
go
somewhat
deeper.
the
question
assumes
and
i
would
agree
that
the
defendant
who
was
injured
by
officers
i
think
under
colorado
state
law
would
have
a
right.
he
would
also
have
a
right
if
he
was
simply
the
victim
of
the
search
for
a
damage
action
assuming
that
the
defenses
of
good
faith
and
other
related
defenses
were
not
present.
but
he
has
no
personal
right
to
the
exclusion
of
that
evidence.
the
exclusionary
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
there
are
many
attorneys
who
would—
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
probably
by
retaining
counsel.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
of
course.
now
it
well
may
be—
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
now,
it
well
may
be
that
the
court
is
unwilling
totally
to
eliminate
the
cognizance
of
fourth
amendment
claims
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
if
so,
the
facts
of
this
case
suggest
a
principle
by
which
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
could
be
limited
to
those
instances
where
its
availability
might
actually
serve
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
we
suggest
the
following
limiting
principle.
a
search
made
in
reasonable
and
good
faith
for
reliance
upon
a
coordinate
branch
of
government
should
not
be
cognizable
on
federal
habeas
corpus.
up
to
now,
we
have
argued
that
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied
on
collateral
attack
because
the
cost
in
applying
it
far
outweigh
any
minimal
effect
it
might
have
--
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
am
drawing
a
line
on
federal
habeas
review.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
if
the
court
made
a
federal
habeas
review,
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
this
is
essentially
a
fall
back
position
your
honor.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
is
not
prepared
totally
to
overrule
kaufman
and
the
related
cases,
then
it
can
limit
review
to
those
cases
in
which
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
rule
is
actually
served.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
i
think
so
your
honor,
although
i
am
not
sufficiently
prepared
on
that
point
to
speak
with
any
great
degree
of
confidence.
you
see
when
an
officer
has
made
an
arrest
or
a
search
in
reasonable
and
good
faith
reliance
on
the
action
of
a
coordinate
branch
of
government,
in
this
case,
the
town
counsel
which
adapted
the
vagrancy
ordinance
and
for
example
in
the
previous
case,
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
search
warrant,
his
action
is
commendable.
it
should
not
be
deterred
at
all.
in
terms
of
influencing
police
conduct,
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
setting
where
the
officer
has
reasonably
relied
on
a
coordinate
branch
of
government
is
actually
contra-productive
because
to
effect
that
it
influences
police
conduct
at
all,
it
invites
officers
to
speculate
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
and
laws
they
are
sworn
to
enforce
or
search
warrants,
they
are
directed
to
execute.
the
ninth
circuit
based
its
decision
on
judicial
integrity.
we
note
only
the
judicial
integrity
was
irrationally
articulated
by
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
authority
over
the
lower
federal
courts.
and
it
has
been
assimilated
into
the
deterrent
rationale.
this
is
clear
from
united
states
v.
peltier.
it
is
inappropriate
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
for
the
state
of
purpose
of
deterring
legislature
from
enacting
invalid
statutes
because
the
very
word
“deter”
assumes
that
legislatures
act
in
bad
faith.
this
is
contrary
to
the
basic
principles
of
democratic
government.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
yes,
that
raises
a
question
of
characterization,
if
you
say
the
fourth
amendment
only
is
into
prohibiting
unreasonable
searches.
i
think
we
can
leave
room
for
a
reasonable
mistake
of
law.
reasonable
good
faith
mistake
of
law,
just
as
in
hill
v.
california—
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
that
is
right.
we
think
it
is
quite
proper
to
correct
to
characterize
as
a
totally
reasonable
search.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
to
make
an
arrest
or
search
which
is
unauthorized
by
an
ex
post
facto
application
of
an
invalidating
decision
then
it
is
only
a
technical
violation.
and
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
on
habeas
corpus
is
meaningless.
you
see
in
this
case,
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
free
a
california
murderer
simply
to
censure
the
town
counsel
of
henderson,
nevada
for
its
alleged
legislative
misjudgment.
this
was
a
gross
abuse
of
federalism,
an
intolerable
miscarriage
of
justice
and
it
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
remains
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
well,
we
are
advised
that
in
the
town
of
henderson,
nevada
they
are
no
longer
making
arrest
under
the
vagrancy
ordinance
but
again,
why
punish
california?
why
set
aside
this
conviction?
it
does
not
serve
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
robert
r.
granucci
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
some
random
thoughts.
first,
there
was
probable
cause.
the
district
court
after
an
independent
examination
of
the
state
trial
record
found
probable
cause.
second,
counsel’s
argument
appears
to
imbued
bad
faith
to
the
town
counsel
of
henderson.
i
would
simply
point
out
that
the
henderson
vagrancy
ordinance
was
based
on
a
nevada
statute.
the
nevada
statute
was
in
turn
based
upon
the
california
disorderly
conduct
statute
and
the
california
disorderly
conduct
statute
was
enacted
in
1961
based
on
a
model
suggested
by
a
respected
scholar,
professor
arthur
sherry
of
the
university
of
california,
law
school
who
had
served
as
the
head
of
governor
earl
warren’s
crime
commission.
counsel
also
cited
almeida-sanchez,
however
in
almeida-sanchez,
as
this
court
noted
in
peltier,
there
were
no
independent
considerations
of
exclusionary
rule
policy
considered
by
the
court
apart
from
the
validity
of
the
statute
which
was
challenged.
i
respectfully
urge
the
court
again
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
to
reinstate
this
conviction.
after
all,
this
is
not
a
vagrancy
case
this
is
a
murder
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
