justice
jr.
do
you
think
the
respondent
in
this
case
does
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
for
unlawful
arrest?
justice
jr.
i
think
the
person
who
is
the
victim
of
an
unlawful
arrest,
the
arrest
being
unlawful
by
virtue
of
an
ordinance
subsequently
being
held
unconstitutional
does
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1983.
justice
jr.
what
if
he
has
not
been
held
unconstitutional
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
then
in
your
view
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
1983?
justice
jr.
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply
to
a
legislature
as
well
as
to
the
police?
justice
jr.
in
fact,
the
suggestion
that
the
real
deterrence
to
a
members
of
the
legislation
is
the
power
of
the
judiciary
to
hold
unconstitutional,
any
act
that
is
indeed
invalid.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
line
with
the
comments
of
the
chief
justice,
is
it
your
view
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
compelled
by
the
constitution?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
what
we
have
said
in
calandra,
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
status
of
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
is
it
your
view
that
the
constitution
requires
that
that
rule
be
enforced
fully
with
every
guide
to
the
circumstances,
have
a
technical
evaluation
of
the
fourth
amendment
maybe?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
any
and
all
circumstances,
the
constitution
requires
that
evidence
illegally
seized
because
of
the
defective
warrant
or
otherwise,
cannot
be
employed,
or
admitted
in
the
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
any
basis
in
that
in
history
of
our
country
or
prior
to
mapp,
any
basis
whatever?

safe
streets
act
of
course
it
is
congressional,
but
has
not
congress
enacted
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
safe
streets
act
both
as
to
violations
of
an
act
by
state
officials
as
well
as
by
federal
officials?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
you,
but
this
is
a
very
important
case
and
you
are
very
well
prepared
on
arguing
it,
very
well
indeed.
i
want
to
come
back
to
question
i
have
asked
you
as
to
whether
congress
had
authority
to
change
the
exclusionary
rule
which
you
view
as
required
by
the
constitution.
if
i
understood
your
answer
correctly,
you
have
said
that
congress
could
change
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
i
myself
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
do
that
for
this
purpose,
but
put
that
aside,
are
you
saying
that
congress
have
no
authority
to
modify
in
any
respect
or
to
revoke
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
constitutional
requirement?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
there
cannot
be
a
constitutional
amendment
to
change
a
judge-made
rule,
that
was
not
even
extended
to
the
states
until
1961?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
read,
you
find
all
of
this
in
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
four
justices
at
that
time,
but
more
than
four
since
then
have
said
it
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement,
in
calandra
for
example.

lewis
f.

the
trier
of

in

an
opportunity
to
consider
the
most
relevant
evidence
on
the
issue
of
truth
which
you
say
is
the
object
of
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
telling
the
truth
is
really
not
always
the
objective,
the
primary
objective
in
litigation
in

trials,
devote
more
time
to
trying
the
police
than
they
do
the
defendant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
these
two
cases
present
the
same
issue,
we
deal
with
them
in
a
single
opinion.
both
come
from
the
united
states
court's
of
appeals,
one
from
the
sixth
and
the
other
from
the
ninth
circuit.
each
of
the
respondents
was
convicted
of
murder
in
trials
in
california
and
nebraska
state
courts
and
their
convictions
were
affirmed
on
appeal.
thereafter
each
sought
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
under
28
u.s.c.a.,
section
2254.
they
contended
that
evidence
seized
during
allegedly
illegal
searches
and
seizures,
the
murder
weapon
in
one
case
and
dynamite
particles
in
the
defendant's
pocket
in
the
other
should
have
been
excluded
from
the
evidence
under
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
agreed
and
granted
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
petitioners
are
the
wardens
of
the
state
prisons.
they
content
that
the
exclusionary
rule
in
fourth
amendment
cases
should
not
be
applied
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
although
this
court
in
several
prior
cases
has
assumed
the
application
of
the
rule,
we
have
never
heretofore
specifically
addressed
this
issue.
the
primary
justification
for
the
exclusionary
rule
is
the
deterrence
of
unlawful
police
conduct.
the
rule
was
created
by
this
court
as
a
means
of
effectuating
the
important
rights,
guaranteed
by
the
fourth
amendment.
for
many
years
the
rule
was
not
deemed
applicable
to
state
courts,
but
15
years
ago,
in
mapp
against
ohio,
the
court
extended
the
rule
to
trials
and
appeals
in
state
courts.
decisions
subsequent
to
mapp
have
established
that
the
rule
is
not
a
personal
constitutional
right.
even
a
trial,
and
on
direct
review
the
cost
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
insubstantial.
the
focus
of
a
trial
is
diverted
from
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
that
should
be
the
central
consent
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
moreover
the
physical
evidence
sought
to
be
excluded
under
the
rule
often
is
the
most
probative
information
bearing
on
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
application
of
the
rule
thus
deflects,
the
truth
finding
process
and
often
frees
the
guilty.
these
cost
of
the
exclusionary
rule
apply
with
special
force
when
following
conviction
and
appeal
in
a
state
court,
the
issue
again
is
presented
on
habeas
corpus.
we
conclude,
therefore,
that
the
contribution
of
the
rule
toward
restraining
police
misconduct
is
minimal
when
applied
on
collateral
attack
often
long
after
trial
and
appeal,
but
we
make
clear
the
limited
scope
of
our
decision.
this
case
does
not
deal
with
a
habeas
corpus
statute
as
a
means
for
re-litigating
constitutional
claims
generally.
we
hold
only
that
a
federal
court
need
not
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
on
fourth
amendment
claims,
unless
there
was
a
showing
that
the
state
prisoner
was
denied
a
full
and
fair
hearing
on
that
claim
at
trial
and
on
direct
review.
in
short,
the
application
of
the
rule
on
habeas
is
limited
to
cases
in
which
there
has
been
both
such
a
showing
and
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr,
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
white

has

a

opinion.
