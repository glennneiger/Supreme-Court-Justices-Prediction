justice
stewart
what
time
of
day
or
night?
justice
stewart
it
should
not
be
open
for
consideration.
justice
stewart
whatever
would
be
the
fourth
amendment
claim?
justice
stewart
but
your
claim
in
that
case
i
suppose
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
court
would
be
a
denial
of
the
right
of
confrontation?
justice
stewart
a
due
process?
justice
stewart
not
necessarily
had
to
hold
that
the
exclusionary
rule
was
constitutionally
required?
justice
stewart
you
are
not
suggesting,
are
you
mr.
granucci
that
the
fourth
amendment
rights
themselves
are
some
sort
of
second
class
non-personal
rights?
justice
stewart
but
by
the
very
terms,
the
fourth
amendment
confers
a
right
upon
each
of
us
to
be
secure
and
he
is
a
person,
his
house,
and
his
effects
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
justice
stewart
it
can
be
nothing
more
personal.
justice
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
stewart
would
that
not
apply
the
same
rule
to
compel
the
self-incrimination
issues
where
the
compulsion
is
then
exerted
prior
to
trial
to
secure
a
statement?
justice
stewart
i
wonder
if
you
are
right,
you
are
suggesting
that
if
the
police
extort
a
confession
from
an
individual
brutally
and
do
not
admit
it
in
the
trial
as
evidence,
that
individual
would
have
no
1983
remedy
against
the
police?
justice
stewart
your
argument
really
all
it
is
directed
to
the
point
that
was
isolated
in
your
colloquy
with
my
brother
brennan,
really
the
arguments
you
are
making
now
is
equally
the
effect
that
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
that
an
arrest
made
under
a
statute
or
in
this
case
an
ordinance
that
was
validly
passed
by
a
city
council
and
the
municipality
in
the
state
of
nevada
which
would
have
never
been
held
to
be
invalid
and
that
a
search
incident
to
that
arrest
was
a
perfectly
valid
search
and
no
violation
of
the
fourth
or
fourteenth
amendment
whatsoever
and
if
that
is
true
then
none
of
these
other
questions
arise.
justice
stewart
because
the
ordinance
is
here
is
(inaudible)
justice
stewart
that
was
a
testimonial
silence
under
--
justice
stewart
in
hofalian
(ph)
terms,
it
is
a
privilege,
i
guess,
and
not
a
right,
is
it
not?
justice
stewart
during
our
basic
submission,
i
gather
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
that
it
is
not
only
the
right,
i
would
say
privilege
of
a
police
officer
but
also
his
duty.
simply,
to
take
it
upon
himself
not
to
enforce
ordinances
duly
enacted
by
the
governmental
unit
by
which
he
is
employed,
if
he
has
a
bona
fide
belief
that
they
are
not
constitutional
laws.
justice
stewart
that
is
not
your
position?
justice
stewart
no,
but
the
reason
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
you
say
is
not
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
is
that
it
was
the
arrest
was
made
under
the
authority
of
an
ordinance
that
was
unconstitutional.
justice
stewart
and
it
would
follow
from
that
i
suppose
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
police
officer
to
take
it
upon
himself
not
to
enforce
ordinances
that
he
in
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
should
know
are
unconstitutional.
justice
stewart
this
certainly
does
not
protect
against
searches
and
seizures
by
private
people
does
it
or
against
mcdonald.
justice
stewart
but
if
the
search
and
seizure
was
not
by
the
legislature,
the
search
and
seizure
was
by
the
police
officer
that
is
the
way
it
has
to
be
measured
does
it
not?
justice
stewart
exactly.
justice
stewart
well,
there
is
still
another
that
has
been
voiced
and
that
is
suppression
is
necessary
to
vindicate
a
personâ€™s
own
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
up
to
this
point,
what
warrants
if
any,
did
they
have?
justice
potter
stewart
not
for
the,
not
for
the
respondent?
justice
potter
stewart
--
up
to
that
point?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
baltimore
case?
justice
potter
stewart
for
two
other
people
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
said
by
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
information
been
published,
made
public
to
the
public
generally?
it
was
a
newspaper,
was
not
it,
or
a
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
peek?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
the
subject
of,
one
of
the
subjects,
one
of
the
two
subjects
of
the
arrest
warrants?
justice
potter
stewart
what,
what
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
wire
is
not
--
it
is
not
quite
so
explicit
as
you
have
indicated,
as
i
read
it.
dynamite
and
illegal
weapons,
also
the
devices
which
might
be
used
to
construct
weapons
or
explosive
devices
which
could
be
used
to
cause
injury
to
persons
or
damage
the
property,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
house
was
empty,
as
i
understand
it
at
all
relevant
times,
although
there
were
lights
on
in
the
house
and
i
think
a
television
set
was
turned
on,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
nobody
in
the
house?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kammerlohr,
before
you
proceed,
may
i
ask
you
is
there
--
do
we
have
any
papers
filed
here
a
copy
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
me
where?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
is
what
i
thought.
but,
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
even
see
the
citation
of
the,
perhaps
your
colleague
can
find
it
--
justice
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
they
have
been
suggested
necessarily
as
alternative
remedies,
they
have
been
suggested
as
additional
remedies,
have
they
not?
maybe
the
exclusionary
rule
only
--
only
serves
to
effectuate
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
trial,
but
other
remedies
are
at
least
theoretically
available
to
effectuate
that
constitutional
provision
in
other
contexts,
i.e.
civil
lawsuits,
bivens;
bivens
case,
you
are
familiar
with,
are
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
an
alternative
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
it
is
an
additional
sanction,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
1983,
where
the
bivens
involved
a
federal
--
the
federal
government,
that
is
the
reason
it
was
in
1983,
but
as
to
against
state
agents
there
might
be
1983
remedies
and
these
are
not
alternatives,
they
are
additional
remedies,
are
they
not,
under
present
state
of
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
was
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
those
remedies,
there
is
considerable
question
about
their
efficacy
and
practical
value,
but
they
are
--
they
are
now
there,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
not
--
you
are
not
suggesting
or
trying
to
invent
addition
--
anything
that
is
not
already
there,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
suggesting
that
we
take
away
something,
not
that
we
add
something,
is
that
correct,
from
what
is
presently
they
are
to
effectuate
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
already
there,
what
would
you
add?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what,
we
should
wait
for,
assuming
that
we
might
consider
--
re-reconsider
the
exclusionary
rule
we
should
not
do
so
until
majority
of
the
state
legislatures
had
acted,
or
majority
of
the
state
courts
had
acted
providing
a
specific
tort
remedy
with
a
minimum
amount
of
recovery,
is
that
your
suggestion?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
understand
that?
justice
potter
stewart
would
not
you
--
would
not
it
be
your
guess
that
every
state
in
the
union,
including
alaska
and
hawaii
probably
have
such
a
tort
remedy
right
now?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
there
be
a
minimum
recovery
even,
what
--
first
of
all
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
liability,
does
not
it?
and
then
normally
recovery
is
--
is
key
to
the
amount
of
damage.
you
are
suggesting
of
what,
punitive
damages,
that
a
state
must
create
a
cause
of
action
and
allow
for
minimum
punitive
damages
before
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
reconsidered
at
least
with
respect
to
that
state,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
how
to
enact
with
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
a
magistrate
be
what,
criminally
of
civilly
liable,
for
doing
what?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
judicial
immunity,
would
it
not?
justice
stewart
they
are
all
in
(inaudible)
justice
stewart
that
was
the
covenant
(ph)
case?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
this
question
could
not
have
arisen
before
the
decision
in
mapp
against
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
except
in
a
rochin
type
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
mapp
was
decided
when,
about
1961?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
question
could
not
have
possibly
have
risen
until
then
and
the
mapp
opinion
and
i
do
not,
i
only
read
it
recently,
was
four
members
of
the
court
joined
it
and
the
fifth,
justice
black,
joined
it
only
on
the
basis
that
involved
compulsory
self
incrimination
rather
than
purely
a
fourth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
followed?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
all,
this
problem
could
not
have
arisen,
and
therefore,
at
the
earliest
it
goes
back
to
the
decision
in
mapp
against
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
there
was
a
conflict
i
gather
on
the
circuits
after
mapp,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
a
claim
of
fourth
amendment
claim,
type
claim,
was
available
on
federal
habeas
corpus
in
reviewing
a
state
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
never,
it
was
rather
only
rather
implicitly
resolved
in
this
court
was
not
it,
because
kaufman
involved
a
federal
review
of
a
federal
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
not
until,
what
case
--?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
court
dealt
with
--
in
linkletter
was
its
retroactivity?
justice
potter
stewart
the
retroactivity
of
mapp?
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
not
have
--
so
that
was
just,
it
was
implicitly
a
sub
silentio
if
you
will,
adopted
this
rule
by
this
court
without
any
explanation
or
explication
or
maybe
realization?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
statement
has
been
made
many
times,
including
an
opinions
of
this
court,
so
you
are
more
or
less
in
good
company,
but
does
not
then
--
on
what
basis
can
one
denigrate
the
state
courts
of
this
country
in
that
way,
to
say
that
they
do
not
have
the
same
kind
of
understanding
of
the
federal
constitution,
nor
that
they,
if
they
understand
it,
they
are
reluctant
to
follow
where
their
understanding
leads?
that
may
once
have
been
true
in
parts
of
the
country
a
hundred
years
ago
and
it
may
have
even
been
true
more
recently
in
other
parts
of
the
country,
but
what
basis
is
there
for
making
that
kind
of
an
assumption?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
once
the
state
court
has
dealt
with
the
issue,
that
is
enough
for
the,
federally?
justice
potter
stewart
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
of
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
certainly
suggested
your
answer,
it
could
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was,
unless
it
was
constitutional,
although
prior
to
mapp,
as
my
brother
powell
has
pointed
--
implied
in
his
--
in
his
question
under
--
under
the
regime
of
weekes
against
the
united
states,
it
was
always
thought
to
be
a
ministerial
rule
of
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
made
constitutional,
it
had
to
be
or
it
could
not
have
been
imposed
upon
the
states.
it
had
to
be
something
beyond
this
courtâ€™s
supervisory
power?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
suggested
i
think
that
this
had,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
had
something
to
do
with
a
fair
trial
and
i
think
some
of
my
colleagues
implicitly
accepted
that
suggestion,
that
at
least
so
long
as
the
exclusionary
rule
existed
it
had
something
to
do
with
a
fair
trial.
do
you
really
think
so?i
never
understood
so.
i
had
always
thought
that
it
had
to
do
with
quite
a
different
constitutional
value,
i.e.
enforcement
of
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
by
their
terms
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
trial,
fair
or
unfair,
they
have
to
do
with
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
in
so
far
as
a
probative,
relevant
material
evidence
is
excluded
from
a
trial
that
leads
to
unfairness
rather
than
fairness,
does
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
anything
that
impairs
the
search
for
truth
impairs
the
search
for
justice
and
certainly
anything
that
excludes,
any
rule
that
excludes
relevant
material,
prohibitive
evidence
impairs
the
fairness
of
a
trial
because
it
impairs
the
full
disclosure
that
a
trial
is
supposed
to
accomplish,
does
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
compulsory
of
self-incrimination
part
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i,
just
to
go
back,
i
thought
the
whole
point
of
the
linkletter,
or
at
least
a
big
part
of
the
point
of
the
linkletter
opinion,
was
that
the
exclusionary
rule
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
fairness
of
a
trial
and
in
so
far
as
it
did
have
anything
to
do
with
a
fairness
of
a
trial,
the
exclusionary
rule
impaired
the
fairness
of
a
trial?
was
not
that
point
of
the
linkletter
opinion,
in
saying
that
the
mapp
rule
was
not
to
be
retroactive?
justice
potter
stewart
probative
material
evidence,
(voice
overlap)
evidence
that
would
clearly
be
admissible,
except
because
of
the
way
it
was
obtained
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
mapp
against
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
constitutional
requirement,
i
suppose
it
is
really
no
different
than
the
right
to
counsel
which
has
developed
over
the
years
that
is
also
constitutionally
compelled,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
other,
which
one?
justice
stewart
privacy.
justice
potter
stewart
under
your
nebraska
practice,
is
it
the
custom
is
to
make
the
motion
before
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
not
at
the
time
(voice
overlap)
the
proper
of
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
although
i
suppose
it
could
be
done
at
the
later
time
too.
you
have
objected
to
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
custom
is
to
file
a
motion
of
suppress
before
the
commencement
of
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
appeal
is
before
the
judge
who
is
going
to
try
the
case
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
at
least
one
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
or
is
it
because
the
state
does
not
have
a
counterpart
of
the
rule
of
the
kaufman
case.
does
the
state
say
we
are
not
going
to
consider
fourth
amendment
type
claims
on
collateral?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
collateral
of
remedy,
state
collateral
remedy
is
limited
to
new
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
have
a
federal
habeas
corpus,
you
do
not
have
a
res
judicata.
in
other
words,
no
2255,
something
--
the
fourth
amendment
claim
might
have
been
in
a
federal
district
court
and
considered
by
the,
by
united
states
court
of
appeals,
nonetheless,
unless
i
am
mistaken,
their
remedy
under
section
2255
is
available
to
reconsider
that
claim,
would
it
not,
under
the
kaufman
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
united
states
court
of
appeals
where
the
conviction
was
affirmed,
we
are
getting
pretty
far
field?
