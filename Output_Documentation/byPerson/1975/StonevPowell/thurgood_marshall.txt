justice
marshall
was
he
ever
charged?
in
doing
this
arrest
was
he
charged
of
possession
of
weapon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
maintain
a
civil
suit
from
the
jail
so
would
it
be
not?
justice
marshall
the
1983
suit
from
the
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
statute
limitations
as
well.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
and
the
terry
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
case
i
understand,
the
facts
are
given
that
when
the
police
approached
him
he
run?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
correct
me,
he
is
going
this
way
and
then
he
turns
around
to
see
the
police
officer
and
he
walks
quickly
the
other
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
department
stores?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
know
what
happened
in
terry?
terry
was
grocery
store
three
times
and
this
is
once.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
he
walked
away,
well
did
the
police
now
have
the
right
to
stop
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
he
have
the
right
to
frisk
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
did
not
say
that,
terry
said
when
he
stopped
him
he
had
the
right
to
frisk
him
once
he
stopped.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
say
in
that
case,
when
he
stopped
him,
he
had
the
right
to
frisk
him
for
his
own
protection
that
is
what
terry
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
a
right
to
ask
the
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
demand
answers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
he
demand
the
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
he
answered
and
he
said
he
was
on
his
way
from
vegas
to
michigan?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
did
he
not
also
say
that
he
was
staying
with
some
people
in
vegas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
would
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
did
answer
the
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
your
basis
mr.
peterson?
that
it
had
been
stolen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
not
have
any
written
identification?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
an
unconstitutional
right
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
now,
what
does
the
policeman
do
now?
does
he
enforce
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
particular
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
that
is
still
on
the
books,
it
has
still
not
been
declared
unconstitutional.
it
is
still
valid.
well,
then
it
was
valid
when
the
policeman
arrested
this
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
a
man
is
arrested
like
this
man
was,
but
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
nevada
had
ruled
that
ordinance
was
constitutional.
are
you
with
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
they
arrest
him
and
they
find
this
incriminating
evidence.
and
subsequently
this
court
said
that
the
nevada
court
was
wrong,
would
that
invalidate
that
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
that
the
only
way
it
could
be
reasonable
that
would
be
a
decision
of
this
court.
right?
or
higher
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
only
way
it
could
be
reasonable.
would
it
be
this
court
or
higher
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
reasonable
if
every
court
in
a
line,
they
rule
on
it
one
way
and
then
we
came
along
later
rule
the
other
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
it
would
not
be
reasonable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
this
would
be
then
clogging
much,
you
say
that
you
wait
here
till
i
get
a
definitive
decision
on
this?
that
is
why
i
am
locked
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
would
you
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
they
knew
the
police
where
there
all
this
time,
did
not
they,
did
not
the
police
first
wrap
on
the
door?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
knew
the
police
were
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
he
went
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
straight.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
you
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
knock
down
doors
and
all
that
knocks
down
old
constitutions,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
and
disconnected
from
the
police
department
in
town?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
situation
i
am
talking
about?
can
you
localize
it
with
police
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
understood
you,
i
thought
you
have
said
you
could
bring
the
exact
same
question
again
in
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
all
of
that
would
be
in
the
record,
we
would
have
the
exact
same
record
we
have
got
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
you
have
done
in
the
suppression
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
it
was
not,
i
said
could
if?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
on
this
record
that
could
not
have
been
put
in
on
motion
to
suppress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
testimony
in
the
suppression
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
reviewed
by
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
say,
could
you
or
could
you
not
have
an
adequate
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
that
judge
had
been
on
the
state
court,
everything
would
have
been
alright?
