but
that
sure
is
for
denial
of
counselâ€”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
peterson,
what
if
a
policeman
makes
a
terry
type
stop
and
ask
for
the
man
he
stops
to
have
any
weapons
on
him.
the
man
says
i
refuse
to
answer.
is
it
your
position
that
the
officer
cannot
take
that
refusal
into
account
in
determining
whether
or
not
(a)
to
frisk
him
or
(b)
to
arrest
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
necessarily
the
same
to
say
that
you
cannot
require
an
answer
in
the
sense
of
beating
it
out
of
a
person
and
to
say
that
you
can
attach
some
significance
to
silence
if
the
normal
person
would
consider
it
relevant?
you
can
say
the
same
should
they
should
go
both
way
but
they
are
not
exactly
the
same
inquiry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
court
here,
we
came
out
differently.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
peltier,
one
of
the
grounds
that
was
relied
and
was
the
fact
that
the
order
officers
had
relied
on
an
active
congress.
and
here,
you
have
got
certainly
some
sort
of
an
analogy
that
if
the
local
policeman
relies
on
an
ordinance
of
his
locality
maybe
it
is
entitled
of
the
same
weight
but
it
is
certainly
a
factor.
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
test
is
whether
the
seizure
was
reasonable.
it
is
not
a
flat
reward
where
the
constitution
says
no
unreasonable
seizure.
and
are
you
saying
that
the
fact
that
he
in
good
faith
relied
on
an
ordinance
he
thought
to
be
valid
and
have
not
held
to
be
otherwise,
simply
is
entitled
to
no
weight
in
the
determination
of
reasonableness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
is
whether
you
look
just
to
that
but
i
am
asking
you
whether
you
say,
is
it
to
be
entirely
out
of
consideration,
the
fact
that
there
was
not
in
effect
an
ordinance
that
had
not
been
held
invalid
in
determining
something
like
reasonableness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
this
amounts
differently.
this
time
we
would
have
not
taken
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cunningham,
i
suppose
you
could
turn
that
argument
around
in
view
of
all
that
we
have
said
about
comity
and
federalism,
in
cases
like
younger
and
osche
(ph),
and
say
that
even
though
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
have
a
federal
collateral
review
of
a
federal
conviction
within
a
unitary
system,
perhaps
the
same
principle
ought
not
to
be
--
ought
not
to
obtain
where
you
are
talking
about
a
federal
system
with
a
federal
court
reviewing
a
state
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
one
would
not
necessarily
treat
all
constitutional
claims
the
same
i
suppose,
but,
that
is
perhaps
right
to
counsel
and
that
type
of
thing
might
be
treated
differently
than
fourth
amendment.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
while
certainly
by
the
argument
you
make
that
it
is
more
important
when
a
federal
court
is
reviewing
a
state
conviction
than
when
a
federal
court
reviews
a
federal
conviction,
you
can
say
just
the
opposite
in
view
of
the
federalism
considerations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
does
that
mean,
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
eight
circuit
was
right
and
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
wrong,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
not
nebraska
have
a
motion
to
suppress
proceeding
where
you
could
make
the
same
sort
of
factual
join
that
was
ultimately
made
before
judge
urbam?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
was
a
municipal
court
judge
in
douglas
county,
that
would
not
be
the
judge
before
whom
a
case
was
tried,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
renew
the
claim
in
the
district
court,
the
state
district
court
where
it
is
being
tried?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
not
he
have
had
to
make
a
factual
showing
at
that
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
make
any
finding
that
there
had
been
any
independent
fifth
amendment
violation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
contending
that
they
should
have
made
such
a
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
quite
a
different
question
whether
it
was
illegally
seized.
i
mean,
there
is
no
connection
between
the
claim
that
it
might
have
been
planted
and
the
claim
that
it
was
illegally
seized,
is
there?
