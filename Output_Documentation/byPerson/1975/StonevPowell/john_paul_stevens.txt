justice
stevens
within
your
argument,
can
i
ask
another
fact
question?
justice
stevens
the
respondent
is
now
on
parole
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
can
you
tell
us
at
what
point
in
the
state
proceedings
he
began
the
service
sentences
after
the
conviction
of
the
trial
court
or
is
it
normally
true
in
california
they
were
to
leave
pil
process
as
exhausted?
justice
stevens
and
that
is
what
happened
here?
justice
stevens
are
you
saying
that
petition
should
not
be
open
in
the
federal
court
if
there
is
no
state
procedure
for
even
raising
the
question
in
the
state
court,
do
you?
is
your
whole
case
premised
on
the
availability
of
the
state
procedure
where
it
could
be
provided?
justice
stevens
well,
then
his
right
has
been
violated
before
the
confession
is
introduced
in
trial.
i
do
not
understand
your
distinction.
justice
stevens
how
can
you
say,
there
would
have
been
a
1983
case
against
them?
i
assume
they
must
have
been
assuming
that
there
was
good
faith
as
the
defense
in
the
1983
action.
justice
stevens
just
one
question
on
the
broader
problem
of
collateral
attack
and
this
kind
of
issue
being
raised
in
a
federal
collateral
attack,
do
you
understand
the
deterrence
is
the
reason
why
there
should
be
collateral
attack
and
state
conviction
is
raising
this
kind
of
question?
let
me
rephrase
it,
i
am
afraid
i
confused
you.
as
i
understand
your
brief,
the
underlying
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
improper
assertions.
justice
stevens
you
say,
the
same
basis,
you
assert
the
same
basis
for
supporting
the
need
for
collateral
attack
in
the
federal
court
on
state
convictions,
the
two
reasons,
deterrence
and
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity.
justice
stevens
this
is
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
the
terms
as
a
justification
for
collateral
attack,
you
are
necessarily
i
assume
also
making
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
difference
between
these
plans
that
will
be
processed
at
the
state
court
and
the
way
it
will
be
processed
in
the
federal
courts
because
if
there
is
no
difference
why
you
do
not
need
the
additional
deterrence
of
collateral
attack.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
stevens
in
some
cases
where
the
federal
court
would
grant
relief
but
not
the
state.
justice
stevens
is
it
not
always
true
that
the
federal
court
addresses
the
issue
three
or
four
years
after
the
criminal
proceeding
began
and
therefore
three
or
four
years
after
the
man
started
his
sentence?
justice
stevens
to
the
extent
that
you
are
talking
about
police
deterrence,
you
are
talking
really
about
whether
a
man
may
serve
a
three
or
four
years
sentences
as
opposed
to
five
or
six
years
sentence.
you
are
only
talking
about
the
latter
portion
of
his
sentence
and
in
this
case,
indeed
we
are
talking
about
a
man
who
is
already
on
parole?
justice
stevens
that
is
normally
the
case
by
the
time
you
exhaust
the
lengthy
proceedings
that
by
the
time
you
reach
the
end
of
the
federal
review
process,
the
question
of
deterrence
pretty
well
then
come
to
an
end?
justice
stevens
if
you
enforce
an
ordinance
like
this,
the
man
will
only
stay
in
jail
for
five
years.
would
you
assume
the
state
will
sustain
the
ordinance
and
sustain
the
conviction?
and
only
relate
this
in
the
federal
court,
the
deterrence
is
that
you
tell
him,
that
you
tell
the
police
that
you
can
only
put
the
man
away
for
five
years?
justice
stevens
to
put
a
man
away
for
five
years.
justice
stevens
by
a
state
court?
justice
stevens
mr.
peterson,
is
it
not
correct
that
in
most
of
this
court’s
decisions
passing
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
vagrancy
ordinance,
the
issue
has
been
presented
on
a
direct
appeal?
is
this
not
the
only
time
this
kind
of
issue
has
been
presented
under
collateral
attack?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
i
mean
in
the
decisions
by
this
court
in
validating
such
ordinances.
justice
stevens
there
was
just
question
whether
you
need
a
collateral
review
as
a
method
of
getting
this
kind
of
issue
to
this
court.
justice
stevens
but
the
point
is,
if
it
gets
here
to
a
direct
review
whether
we
take
it
or
not.
justice
stevens
is
not
it
irrelevant
statistic,
the
number
of
times
that
state
trial
courts
have
held
warrants
insufficient,
those
that
were
probably
not
appealed?
justice
stevens
you
are
dealing
with
very,
very
sketchy
information
is
what
i
am
suggesting
when
you
just
point
to
one
supreme
court
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
rationale
is
the
correct
one,
can
you,
that
is
the
shelly
versus
kramer
approach,
can
you
possibly
justify
the
limitation
on
standing
have
it
only
the
defendant
who
can
raise
the
issue,
would
it
not
be
necessary
under
that
rationale
that
the
point
be
available
to
the
defendant,
even
though
it
was
some
third
parties’
rights
who
were
invaded
by
the
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
holding
maybe
correct
under
alderman,
who
would
be
inconsistent
with
your
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
is
what
i
am
suggesting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
harlan
advocated
the
claim
of
innocence
position
in
kaufman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
think
that
is
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
nebraska
rule
if
there
had
not
been
a
motion
to
suppress
at
the
criminal
trial?
could
the
defendant
raise
the
issue
in
the
collateral
proceeding
in
a
state
court,
the
fourth
amendment
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
is
the
fact
that
there
was
actually
the
question
litigated
that
forecloses
it.
it
would
not
waive
it
by
dealing
to
make
the
motion
