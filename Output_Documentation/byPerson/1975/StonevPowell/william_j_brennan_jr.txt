justice
jr.
in
fact,
intentional,
knowing
violation
it
would
be
excluded,
is
that
the
line
you
are
drawing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
a
knowing
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
have
excluded?
justice
jr.
that
is
where
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
illegal
search
was
known
and
unintentional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
this
brief?
justice
jr.
i
thought
the
argument
you
were
just
making
assume
that
the
ordinance
was
constitutional
but
nevertheless,
there
is
no
probable
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
lies
on
the
ground
on
which
the
judgment
we
are
reviewing
rested?
justice
jr.
but
mr.
granucci
said,
he
said
that
he
was
hurrying.
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
otherwise,
unless
we
address
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
--
the
probable
cause.
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
that
had,
there
not
been
habeas
remedy
available
in
this
case,
and
the
respondent
here
were
limited
to
direct
review
in
this
court.
you
are
suggesting
i
gather
that
there
would
have
been
no
record
upon
which
we
could
properly
have
evaluated
the
merit
of
the
fourth
amendment
--
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
the
case
from,
from
nebraska
case
being
nebraska
actually?
i
do
not
know
whether
the
situation
has
changed.
one
of
the
problems
as
i
recall
the
trouble
was
then,
was
that
too
many
states
no
longer
--
did
not
yet
have
adequate
collateral
procedures
because
i
remember
nebraska
adopted
one,
three
or
four
days,
before
case
nebraska
was
to
be
argued
here
and
i
do
not
know
how
its
function
since,
i
do
not
if
what
you
tell
us
about
this
case,
at
least
to
this
case
it
has
not
functioned
too
effectively?
justice
jr.
well
i
gather
then
(inaudible)
the
prospect
is
that
in
nebraska
we
are
not
like
we
are
the
only
court,
only
federal
court,
to
review
the
federal
constitutional
claim.
we
are
not
like
to
ever
to
get
a
record
adequately
to
do
that?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
going
out
only
to
this
system
--
justice
jr.
--
holding
the
inadequacy
and
everything
else
to
the
state
procedure.
if
the
only
federal
court,
if
the
only
federal
court
to
review
the
federal
constitutional
claim
is
this
court,
if
that
is
the
system,
what
bearing
if
any
the
valid
or
nature
of
our
discretionary
jurisdiction
have
on
its
inadequacy
as
a
system?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
reserve
the
situation
--
procedures
which
would
could
make
you
want
to
vomit?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
cold
case
in
nebraska.
nebraska
adopted
a
counterpart
of
2255
as
its
post
conviction
procedure,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
is
that
still
the
one?
justice
jr.
and
in
this
could
there
have
been
a
proceeding
under
that
remedy
after
the
supreme
court
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
suppress?
