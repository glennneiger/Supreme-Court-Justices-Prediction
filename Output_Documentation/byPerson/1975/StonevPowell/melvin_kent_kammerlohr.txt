mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
--
for
the
then
warden
wolff
of
the
nebraska
penitentiary
who
is
no
longer
there,
was
the,
is
now
a
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
case
brought
by
mr.
david
rice
under
28
u.s.c
2254
to
primarily
contest
the
admission
at
his
trial
of
some
dynamite,
dynamite
caps,
tools,
other
paraphernalia
and
also
later
some
dynamite
particles
found
in
his
clothing
at
the
police
station.
briefly
how
this
case
arouse,
your
honors,
on
the
early
morning
hours
of
august
17,
1970.
the
police
station
in
omaha,
nebraska
received
a
911
emergency
call,
they
had
woman
who
was
screaming,
sounded
like
perhaps
she
was
being
raped
and
a
certain
location
was
given.
two
patrol
cars
were
dispatched,
a
third
patrol
car
heard
the
message
and
also
went
to
the
location
on
ohio
street
in
omaha,
nebraska
and
upon
entering
the
premises,
officer
larry
menard
saw
a
suitcase
on
the
floor
which
he
moved
slightly,
and
the
suitcase
exploded
killing
officer
menard
and
injuring
two
other
policemen
and
demolishing
the
house.
the
--
about
five
days
later
on
the
22
of
august
1970,
the
police
had,
during
those
five
days
working
round
the
clock
trying
to
gather
evidence
and
so
on,
had
learned
that
from
witnesses
that
the
bomb
had
been
planted
by
one
dwaine
peek
who
is
a
member
of
the
national
committee
to
combat
fascism,
which
was
also
considered
--
said
to
be
in
a
case,
and
referred
to
as
an
offshoot
of
the
black
panther
organization.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor,
just
giving
background
to
refresh
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
and
also,
information
in
the
--
as
a
result
of
this
information
and
prior
building
of
records
over
two-year
period
of
newsletters,
put
out
by
the
national
committee
to
combat
fascism
that
they
had
advocated
violence
to
police
officers,
including
the
killing
of
police
officers.
with
the
--
plus
another
evidence,
they
had
gathered
that
perhaps
one
edward
poindexter
who
was
a
member
of
the
national
committee
and
officer,
president
i
believe
of
the
national
committee
to
combat
fascism
and
dwaine
peek,
arrest
warrants
were
issued
for
those
two
members.
the
police
started
on
what
they
call
a
taskforce
on
the
afternoon,
late
afternoon
of
august
22,
first
went
to
the
headquarters
of
the
national
committee
to
combat
fascism.
they
went
through
the
headquarters
looking
for
these
two
persons
that
they
had
a
search
warrant
--
arrest
warrant
for
and
did
not
locate
them.
they
then
went
to
poindexter’s
home,
did
not
locate
him
there.
they
went
to
cousin,
a
cousin’s
home
of
dwaine
peek,
cousin’s
name
are
frank
and
will
peek
and
then
they
went
to
the
home
of
david
rice,
who
is
the
respondent
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
up
to
this
point,
they
had
arrest
warrants
for
dwaine
peek
and
edward
poindexter,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
at
this
point.
the
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
they
did
not,
i
think
the
opinion
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit,
does
a
disservice
to
this
case
by
saying,
by
comparing
it
to
langford
versus
gilstone
where
some
300
non-related
searches
were
made.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
there
are
only
three
searches
made
before
they
arrived
at
the
rice
premises
and
even
those
were
connected.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
they
searched
the
premises
at
the
headquarters,
at
the
other
two
stops
the
record
is
not
clear
just
what
they
did,
they
went
there
looking
for
them
at
least.
i
believe
at
the
one
place,
there
was
a
police
officer
there
already,
who
assured
them
that
neither
one
of
the
defendants
are
on
the
--
the
subjects
were
on
the
premises.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
were
all
three
members
of
the
party,
the
national
committee
to
combat
fascism,
and
--
which
had
been
prior
--
previously
connected
into
the
case
by
the
fact
that
dwaine
peek
was
said
to
have
planted
the
bomb
for
the
national
committee
to
combat
fascism.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
his
sisters
and
donald
peek
a
brother
had
given
this
information
to
the
police.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
all
the
police
officers
were
cognizant
of
this.
several
witnesses
had
seen
dwaine
peek
carrying
a
heavy
suitcase
and
telling
people,
do
not
touch
it,
on
the
night
before
the
--
the
night
before
the
bomb
was
planted.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct.
the
--
upon
arrival
or
some,
late
at
night,
maybe
nine-thirty,
ten
o'clock
at
night
that
david
rice's
premises,
the
lights
were
on,
a
television
set
was
playing,
they
could
see
it
through
the
door,
the
police
knocked
on
the
door
and
there
was
no
response.
and
at
this
time
the
--
two
of
the
police
officers
decided
they
should
go
back
and
see
if
they
could
get
a
search
warrant.
they
left
the
other
officers
there
to
surround
the
house
and
the
two
officers
went
back
to
the
police
headquarters
and
drafted
an
affidavit
and
found
themselves
a
magistrate,
who
incidentally
in
nebraska,
all
magistrates
are
members
of
the
nebraska
bar
association
in
good
standing,
they
presented
the
affidavit
to
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
search
warrant
for
the
premises
describing
the
exact
address
of
david
rice’s
premises
and
the
things
to
be
searched
or
to
be
seized.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
dynamite,
dynamite
caps,
pliers,
pincher-nose
pliers,
those
are
the
kind
of
--
maybe
i
should,
it
is
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
it
is
on
page
ten
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
that
is
it,
your
honor.
it
is
not
--
it
does
not
say
the
pliers
and
the
wires,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
in
any
--
in
any
case
the
police
then
with
--
the
two
officers
with
the
search
warrant
went
back
to
the
rice
premises
and
all
the
officers
entered
the
premises
and
found
the
evidence,
which
is
objected
to
in
this
case.
it
was
all
in
plain
sight
upon
entering
the
premises.
they
did
not
have
to
overturn
anything
or
open
any
drawers
or
anything
of
that
nature.
the
federal
district,
well,
first
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
there
was
no
one
there
inside
the
premises.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
still
no
one
inside
the
premises,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
the
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
they
staked
out
the
house
while
they
were
gone.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
two
officers,
to
get
the
warrant
of
arrest
and
staked
out
the
house.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
correct,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
people
in
the
house.
the
--
before
the
actual
trial,
the
respondent
moved
for
suppression
in
the
district
court
of
douglas
county,
which
is
in
omaha.
the
district
court
denied
suppression
of
the
evidence.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
affirmed
finding
that
the
affidavit
for
search
warrant
was
sufficient.
the
federal
district
court
in
the
2254
case
then
found
that
the
affidavit
for
search
warrant
was
not
sufficient.
we
then
had
later,
after
that
order
was
first
--
that
order
of
several
months
previous
to
the
--
to
another
order
which
the
federal
district
court
later
issued
finding
that
there
were
not
any
other
grounds
either
authorizing
legal
entry
into
the
premises.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
then
petitioned
this
court
and
are
here
and
although
i
have
a
number
of
issues
in
my
brief
and
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
i
would
like
to
primarily
argue
two
main
points
which
we
would
urge
this
court
to
adopt
and
we
would
still
like
to
rely
of
course
on
our
other
points
in
our
case,
should
those
be
denied.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
opinion
does
not
appear
--
the
federal
opinions
are
all
i
have
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
have
the
188
nebraska,
728
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
as
i
have
alluded
to
--
alluded
in
my
brief,
this
court
of
course
is
very
familiar
with
the
arguments
against
the
exclusionary
rule
and
for
the
exclusionary
rule
and
there
has
been
dissatisfaction
mentioned
a
number
of
times
so
that
i
do
not
intend
to
go
into
all
of
those
various
cases
and
try
to
tell
the
this
court
the
same
things
that
you
are
very
familiar
with
and
take
up
your
time
and
time
of
others
here.
i
do
think
i
should
mention,
just
briefly,
why
we
do
not
feel
that
the;
number
one,
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply
on
officers
or
acting
under
a
search
warrant.
we
would
ask
the
clerk
to
modify
the
exclusionary
rule
to
very
least
to
that
point.
the
magistrate
perhaps
was
the
person
who
was
wrong
if
anyone
was
wrong
and
issued
a
search
warrant
in
this
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
blame
or
that
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
served
if
the
purposes
are
to
deter
unlawful
action
of
the
police
or
they
have
tried
to
do
what
is
right,
they
have
gone
to
a
lawyer
magistrate
and
asked
for
a
search
warrant.
i
don’t
see
how
can
there
can
be
any
possibility
of
deterrents
to
future
cases,
because
it
is
the
type
of
procedure
we
operate
under,
it
is
preemptory
type
writ,
there
is
no
way
of
having
an
immediate
hearing
to
see
if
the
writ
is
any
good.
the
police
certainly
would
not
be
in
a
position
every
time
they
get
a
search
warrant
to
question
its
validity.
we
encourage
the
use
of
search
warrants
and
i
believe
the
imposition
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
go
more
to
discourage
the
use
of
search
warrants
than
to
encourage
it.
so
for
those
reasons
and
for
that
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
i
would
ask
the
court
to
at
least
modify
the
exclusionary
rule
to
that
extent
when
officers
are
operating
under
search
warrant.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
generally,
i
would
ask
in
good
--
when
they
are
operating
in
good
faith
and
think
that
they
are
following
the
law
that
the
exclusionary
rule
serves
no
purpose
and
in
that
light
generally,
i
might
also
say
i
know
we
are
all
interested
in
seeing
that
we
have
the
preservation
of
freedom
and
privacy
in
this
country,
but
the
exclusionary
rule
as
this
court
well
knows,
does
absolutely
nothing
to
protect
those
who
do
not
have
any
guilty
evidence
on
their
premises.
if
the
police
should
suddenly
take
it
into
their
heads
to
become
a
police
state
or
nazi-type
state,
the
general
public
who
does
not
have
any
guilty
evidence
on
their
premises
where
they
have
--
have
absolutely
no
remedy
under
the
exclusionary
rule,
they
are
not
just
protected.
the
same
is
true
when
the
police
take
it
into
their
head
to
harass
gamblers
or
house
of
prostitution
or
anything
else
where
they
do
not
want
the
evidence
to
used
in
the
court,
but
they
merely
want
to
either
gather
the
evidence
to
destroy
it
or
they
want
to
--
let
them
know
that
they
are
aware
of
their
operations,
the
exclusionary
rule
does
those
people
absolutely
no
good.
now,
we
do
not,
we
cannot
measure
of
course
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
it
could
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
because
the
alternative
remedies
that
then
suggest,
i
believe
they
could,
your
honor.
if
we
had
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
unless
we
do
provide
a
better
remedy
than
the
exclusionary
rule,
your
honor?
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
the
bivens
case
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
an
additional
--
1983
cases
--
i
believe
that
was
a
probably
a
1983
case,
was
it
not?
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
was
not.
well,
i
believe
that
anyway
that
there
is
a
remedy
under
42
1983.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
in
a
present
state
of
the
law,
but
i
am
just
saying
that
those
writers
like
allan
oaks,
professor
oaks
and
mr.
chief
justice
burger
i
believe
dissented
in
bivens
to
suggest
that
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
if
we
should
move
away
from
the
exclusionary
rule
completely
we
should
have
an
alternative
remedy.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
they
are.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
not
suggesting
that
we
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
suggesting
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
do
a
thing
for
these
certain
classes
that
i
was
mentioning.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
and
i
am
suggesting
that
we
do
add
something
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
would
make
a
requirement
that
before
the
exclusionary
rule
be
completely
abandoned
by
this
court
in
all
cases
that
the
states
must
provide
a
tort
remedy
with
a
minimum
recovery
for
the
person
who
is
injured.
i
guess
the
governmental
subdivision
who
employs
the
police
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
you
could
impose
that
in
an
opinion
to
make
an
incentive
for
state
legislatures
to
move
ahead
and
do
this
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
it
could
be
done
by
this
court.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
not
with
any
minimum
recovery,
i
think
that
is
the
problem
with
most
of
them
as
people
are
not
materially
injured
very
much
in
this
cases.
so
they
do
not
even
bother
the
tort
remedy
because
they
might
get
a
few
dollars
back
and
it
would
not
be
worth
it.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
would
be
a
form
of
those,
your
honor,
yes.
a
punitive
damages
i
guess
you
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor
and
of
course
i
am
not
advocating
that
in
this
case
as
far
as
a
search
warrant.
i
think
that
this
court
should
not
impose
exclusionary
rule
in
cases
where,
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier,
search
in
--
under
search
warrant.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
--
unless
there
is
some
showing
of
collusion
or
fraud
or
something
like
that
or
the
police
actually
lied
in
their
affidavit
or
something
in
that
nature,
perjury.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well,
that
is
what
they
are
in
our
case,
i
do
not
know
how
many
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
there
is
no
connection.
he
is
supposed
to
be
interpose
between
the
police
and
the
public.
he,
i
believe
that
if
someone
were
to
be
--
if
some
sort
of
a
sanction
ought
to
be
imposed,
it
ought
to
be
imposed
on
the
magistrate,
we
should
do
away
on
the
absolute
protection
that
magistrate
has
in
this
type
of
case,
which
i
believe
is
a
court-made
rule.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
suggesting
that
a
magistrate
who
is
grossly
negligent,
that
should
have
a
some
sort
of
liability
or
else
his
employers,
yes
and
remove
the
immunity,
the
absolute
immunity
that
magistrates
now
enjoy.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
would
cut
across,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
it
be
one
possibility
at
least
that
an
alternative
rather
to
say
that
we
are
trying
to
deter
the
police
who
cannot
possibly
understand
all
of
the
intricacies
and
the
certainties
of
the
law.
also
the
--
a
lot
of
prosecutors
do
not
understand
the
intricacies
and
the
certainties
of
the
law.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
sorry,
but
time
got
away
from
me,
your
honor.
the
other
point
which
i
strongly
urge
this
court
to
adopt
was
the,
i
believe
i
can
refer
to
this
--
the
easiest
the
court
rule
know
what
i
am
talking
about
is
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
versus
bustamonte
that
the
federal
courts
not
consider
search
and
seizure.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
you
need
to
consider?
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
oh!
the
one
i
have
just
made.
well,
i
think
that
two
could
work
together
in
some
cases,
it
is
rather
a
fall-back
position,
but
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
the
first
argument.
the
--
i
believe
that
the
second
argument
is
based
on;
(a)
that
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
connected
with
a
collar
book
claim
of
innocence,
plus
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
the
state
court
and
to
err
these
issues.
now,
i
cannot
conceive
right
off
where
second
issue
would
need
to
be
but
there
could
be
a
possibility
i
suppose
where
the
petitioner
is
claiming
that
the
fourth
amendment
resulted
in
being
unjustly
convicted
because
he
was
innocent
and
he
had
a
valid
opportunity
to
contest
it,
and
yet
it
was
under
a
search
warrant.
and
if
we
did
not
adopt
the
first
issue
then
he
would
still
be
able
to
bring
it
up
under
the
invalid
search
warrant,
in
those
cases
only
however.
but
of
course
nobody
here
wants
an
innocent
man
convicted,
i
believe
that
is
a
point
that
should
be
allowed
to
continue
and
i
believe
everybody
would
agree
with
that
in
2254
cases.
that
--
this
--
in
summary
then
i
would
urge
the
court
to
or
i
would
say
that
we
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
and
with
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
harlan,
justice
harlan
in
the
kaufman
case
in
the
dissent.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
mr.
peek
testified
on
behalf
of
the
state
against
mr.
rice.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
--
in
my
brief
which
i
have
not
argued,
which
i
think
this,
i
think
the
eight
circuit
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
the
eight
circuit
is
out
of
line
in
comparing
the
case
with
langford
versus
gilstone
(ph)
and
also
with
saying
that
the
police
their
exigent
circumstances
argument
by
going
for
a
search
warrant.
it
is
trying
to
take
one
for
the
other,
you
know,
a
trade-off
of
some
type
and
they
did
leave
a
cordon
around
the
empty
house
and
i
do
--
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
say
that
we
lost
exigent
circumstances
argument.
and
thirdly,
i
think
that
the
court
misconstrued
the
hayden
case
by
saying
that
the
police
had
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
person
they
were
looking
where
there
at
the
very
time
they
entered
the
premises.
because
in
warden
versus
hayden,
even
though
they
knew
the
person
where
in
there
they
did
not
know
that
--
they
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
open
the
washing
machine
lid
where
they
found
the
weapon,
and
nevertheless
that
was
sustained.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
let
me
have
a
minute,
your
honor,
just
to
clarify
a
couple
of
points.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
first
i
would
like
to
pint
out
that
even
though
the
counsel
claims
that
mr.
rice
makes
some
claims
of
innocence,
what
mr.
justice
powell
was
talking
about
and
mr.
black
--
justice
black
and
harlan
and
stewart
in
the
bustamante
case
and
the
kaufman
cases
was
a
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we
are
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment
in
that
if
habeas
corpus
were
allowed
in
fourth
amendment,
it
would
reveal
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence,
then
they
should
preserve
it
in
those
cases,
but
not
a
claim
of
innocence
based
on
something
that
is
not
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
whole
or
the
suggestion
of
those
opinions
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
he
did
not
limit
it
to
that,
he
did
not
limit
it
to
that
at
least,
but
i
am
just
suggesting
that
it
means
a
claim
of
innocence
under
the
fourth
amendment
not
a
claim
of
innocence,
say
for
insufficient
evidence
that
the
jury
has
already
ruled
against
it.
it
is
which
what
he
is
arguing
here
that
maybe
the
jury
was
wrong,
but
not
would
be
remedied
any
by
a
fourth
amendment
claim
and
habeas
corpus.
another
point
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
motion
for
suppression
in
this
case
was
handled
by
the
federal
--
by
the
state
district
court,
not
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
search
warrant.
the
magistrate
issued
a
search
warrant
then
the
case
came
to
the
trial
court
level,
which
is
a
jury
trial
level
in
nebraska.
and
the
motion
was
made
in
that
trial
court,
the
same
court
who
later
held
the
trial,
the
same
judge.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
we
have
a
procedure
for
a
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
motion
to
suppress
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
then
i
believe
it
can
still,
but
i
am
not
certain
--
if
it
can
still
be
brought
up
at
the
time
of
trial.
i
would
certainly
think
so
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
correct,
and
then
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
generally
speaking
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
district
court
judges.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
still
the
one
we
have,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
not
as
concerning
the
search
warrant.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
it
would
be
because
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
had
already
decided
the
issue.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
new
questions,
which
have
not
been
before
the
court.
now,
they
might
have
brought
up
the
search
without
the
warrant
--
in
collateral
proceedings,
they
did
not.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
that
is
what
would
happen
if
someone
brought
back
in
the
district
court
a
collateral
proceeding,
the
district
judge
would
merely
say
this
has
all
been
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court
and
the
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
under
the
kaufman
case
if
the
identical
question
had
been
to
this
court
and
ruled
adversely,
i
do
not
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
do
not
see
how
it
could,
but
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
at
least,
now
judge
urbam
--
it
is
--
you
are
correct
to
the
fact
it
was
litigated.
now,
the
other
question,
a
search
without
the
search
warrant,
which
i
brought
up
in
the
state
supreme
court,
was
not
litigated
there
because
they
held
the
search
warrant
was
valid,
but
judge
urbam
said
that
the
fact
the
we
briefed
it
in
state
supreme
court
was
sufficient
exhaustion
in
federal
courts,
which
i
disagree
with
also.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
is
incorrect.
and
another
point
that
i
think
mr.
cunningham
brought
up
which
highlights
the
bad
part
of
having
a
habeas
--
federal
habeas
corpus
sitting
years
later
is
that
when
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
held
before
judge
urbam
some
four
years
after
the
fact
and
the
evidence
is
not
clear
at
that
time
in
the
officer’s
mind,
they
have
had
hundreds
of
cases
probably
since
the
time
and
one
lieutenant
perry
testified
at
that
evidentiary
hearing
four
years
later
that
he
--
that
dwaine
peek
had
told
them
before
they
went
to
the
rice
premises
that
the
bomb
was
constructed
there
at
the
rice
premises
and
that
dwaine,
his
brother,
had
told
him
this.
judge
urbam,
and
he
--
then
judge
urbam
is
doing
the
questioning
and
he
said,
well
how
do
you
know
that?
and
he
said,
i
was
present
when
officer
foxel
(ph)
interrogated
dwaine
peek
and
judge
urbam
then
looked
on
the,
a
sheet
they
have
at
the
police
station
that
shows
who
was
present
at
the
interrogation,
and
lieutenant
perry’s
name
did
not
appear
on
there.
so
judge
urbam
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
lieutenant
perry
was
perjuring
himself,
and
i
think
he
put
a
lot
of
weight
on
this
and
this
is
just
one
of
the
bad
things
that
happened
by
hiring
before
you
litter.
i
say
that
lieutenant
perry
might
have
learned
about
in
a
number
of
ways
and
forgot
how
he
learned
about
it,
and
it
did
not
necessarily
perjure
himself.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
he
did
not
--
he
got
in
to
the,
he
got
in
to
it
on
the
search
without
a
warrant
issue
--
without
a
search
warrant
issue.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
he
did
not
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
search
warrant
issue.
once
he
found
that
the
search
warrant
was
invalid,
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
was
invalid,
then
we
raised
issues
that
nevertheless
the
police
had
a
right
to
be
on
the
premises,
then
he
held
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
that
question.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor
because
the
supreme
court
never
reached
that
issue.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
i
am
just,
i
am
merely
saying
this
shows
that
the
police
officer’s
memories
may
get
kind
of
dim
after
four
years.
thank
you,
your
honors.
