chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1055,
stone
against
powell.
mr.
granucci,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
burger
on
this
person?
chief
justice
burger
where
he
had
the
opportunity?
chief
justice
burger
(inaudible)
in
terms
of
time
frame?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
something
on
the
nature
of
a
doctrine
of
laches
should
be
applied
in
the
criminal
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
terms
are
more
like
supervisory
power
than
constitutional,
do
they
not?
there
is
no
personal
constitutional
right
than
the
only
other
reach
of
this
court
or
the
federal
court
would
be
under
supervisory
power
or
is
there
third
alternative?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
taking
the
language
that
you
were
reciting
yesterday,
that
language
is
not
comporting
more
with
supervisory
power
than
it
does
with
defining
an
individual
personal
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certainly,
this
court
has
no
authority
other
than
the
constitution
for
imposing
the
exclusionary
rule
on
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
one
you
were
quoting
earlier
came
from
calandra
not
mapp
against
ohio?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
between
a
systemic
rule
that
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
system
as
distinguished
from
the
doctrine
or
rule
that
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
particular
individual.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
is
what
you
meant
by
using
the
term
societal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
not
go
to
the
reliability
and
trustworthiness
of
the
confession
as
distinguished
from
no
challenge
to
the
reliability
or
trustworthiness
of
the
pistol
found
in
the
pocket
of
this
man?
chief
justice
burger
he
can
maintain
it
when
and
if
he
is
free.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
something
on
the
lines
of
the
english
rule
that
only
flagrant
violations
would
be
the
subject
of
an
exclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
also
have
any
effect
to
deterring
police
officer
in
this
town
in
nevada
from
enforcing
the
dubious
ordinance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
peterson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
the
police
officer
should
reasonably
have
known
that
this
was
unconstitutional
ordinance?
chief
justice
burger
it
(inaudible)
that
the
ninth
circuit
rested
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
a
founded
suspicion
in
terry,
mr.
peterson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
likelihood
or
non-likelihood
of
his
having
a
pistol
in
his
pocket?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
generalization,
it
is
probably
and
equally
good
generalization
that
some
of
these
gentleman
needs
an
activity
where
he
carefully
avoids
carrying
a
gun
in
order
to
avoid
a
higher
degree
of
crime.
i
suggest
that
this
second
generalization,
hypothetical
is
just
as
valid
as
yours.
neither
one
of
them
very
valid.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
say
that
the
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
may
be
considered
by
a
court
and
by
the
policeman
in
the
first
incident
and
whether
or
not
he
should
make
a
search?
chief
justice
burger
(inaudible)
some
disabilities
to
mr.
terry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
20
times
is
just
presumably
in
prima
facie
as
much
of
the
constitutional
right
as
refusing
to
answer
the
question
that
you
pose
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
terry
did
not
conceive
in
any
sense
that
his
conduct
gave
the
appearance
of
the
possible
commission
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
speaking
of
the
defendant
himself,
mr.
terry,
the
opinion
however
the
court
drew
some
inferences
and
said
that
this
was
enough
to
warrant
a
cautious
and
prudent
policeman
to
take
some
steps
including
a
complete
search
of
the
man.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
had
something
to
say
about
that
long
after
terry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
a
stop?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
invalid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
grant
of
certiorari
is
dispensed
or
cast
some
cloud
in
that
sense
over
the
ordinance?
we
might
have
been
taking
it
all
for
anyone
knows
to
simply
determine
strictly
whether
in
the
eyes
of
the
policeman
to
take
chief
justice
warren’s
language
out
of
the
terry
case.
he
observed
unusual
conduct
which
led
him
reasonably
to
conclude
in
the
light
of
his
experience
that
something
was
not
good.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
already
an
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
does
the
terry
case,
the
holding
of
the
terry
case
require
that
there
be
an
arrest
before
there
can
be
a
frisk
and
a
tack
down
looking
for
weapons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
search
may
be
made
without
an
arrest
under
terry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
frisking
process
or
patting
down,
conceivably
that
might
tip
the
scales
on
the
part
of
the
officer
and
not
to
pursue
the
matter
any
further.
or
to
continue
the
interrogation
which
might
as
well
lead
to
his
release
or
his
moving
on
as
to
his
being
taken
under
custody.
the
search
in
terry
was
for
just
one
purpose,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happened
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
marshall’s
hypothetical
inquiry,
in
the
interim,
after
the
ordinance
is
on
the
books
and
before
the
supreme
--
the
highest
court
of
the
state
has
passed
on
it,
is
there
not
an
old
fashioned
idea
of
the
presumption
of
the
constitutionality
and
validity
of
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
just
as
valid
before
the
supreme
court
of
nevada
passes
on
it
as
it
is
afterwards
for
these
purpose,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
obviously,
this
officer
passed
on
it
in
that
interim
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
response,
i
thought
you
gave
to
mr.
justice
stewart
in
a
while
ago
that
you
were
not
taking
position
that
this
officer
had
any
duty
or
any
power
at
some
constitutionality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
point
you
are
making
almost
seems
to
suggest
that
all
these
ordinances
are
fungible
or
they
are
just
exactly
alike,
that
chief
justice
warren
in
the
terry
opinion
took
about
a
half
a
page
to
point
out
the
myriad
variety,
the
infinite
variety
of
ordinances.
great
many
people
are
going
to
have
different
views
about
whether
a
particular
holding
of
this
court
fits
one
way
or
the
other
on
a
particular
ordinance,
you
think
that
so?
chief
justice
burger
acting
suspiciously
would
be
equally
inferred.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
almost
precisely
the
language
this
court
used
in
the
terry
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
authorized
a
full
search
which
in
this
case
and
in
many
other
cases
would
produce
a
gun
or
heroine
or
some
other
evidence
of
criminality.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
this
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
74-1222,
wolff
against
rice.
mr.
kammerlohr,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
inform
any
of
the
predicate
for
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant,
does
not
it?
you
are
just
giving
background
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
information
in
possession
of
the
police
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
search
anything
at
the
first
two
stops?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
the
pursuant
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
had
mentioned,
at
that
point
the
mission
was
to
execute
to
serve
an
arrest
warrant
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
for
two
people
who
are
not
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
burger
they
staked
out
the
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
sent
an
officer
to
get
the
warrant
that
you
just
referred
to
on
pages
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
generally,
i
suppose
you
mean
--?
chief
justice
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
the
state
provides
an
alternative
remedy
then
the
mapp
against
ohio
is
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
trouble
damages
plus
attorneys’
fees,
some
sort
of
approach?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
in
several
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
going
to
make
two
points
on
this,
you
have
made
one
now
and
your
second
one
you
have
only
about
two
or
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
peek
who
came
back
into
the
act
and
testified
that
he
indeed
was
the
fellow
who
carried
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
had
arranged
that
he
and
--
the
respondent
here
had
arranged
this
booby
trap
suitcase
that
killed
the
policeman
that
you
have
described
earlier.
have
you
not,
you
are
not
making
a
harmless
error
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
kammerlohr.
mr.
cunningham.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
relevance
--
significantly
relevant
facts
that
have
been
omitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
footnote
that
you
have
just
referred
to,
establishes
just
one
thing
and
that
is
that
the
eight
circuit
is
a
little
more
final
than
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
because
it
is
subsequent,
does
it
really
establish
anything
else
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
answers
would
be
less,
more
or
less
candid
before
the
united
states
district
judge
as
compared
with
a
state
court
judge
of
nebraska?
does
not
this
depend
on
the
lawyer
more
than
on
the
judicial
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
urbam’s
cross
examination
was
a
little
more
effective
than
defense
counsel’s
cross
examination
in
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
good
as
the
system
or
is
it
the
subjective
factors
of
the
idiosyncrasies
and
talents
of
the
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
unarticulated
premise
of
your
whole
position,
i
take
it
must
be,
but
you
tell
me
if
that
is
not
so,
that
the
case
presented
by
this
record,
where
a
man
who
has
set
a
booby
trap
with
dynamite
in
a
suitcase,
in
pursuit
of
his
own
objectives,
obviously
criminal
if
we
believe
this
record,
is
to
get
off
scotfree
and
that
that
is
an
appropriate
price
to
pay
for
mistakes
in
a
warrant
application
or
in
the
granting
of
that
application
by
a
judicial
officer
in
nebraska.
hat
that
is
a
reasonable
and
an
appropriate
price
to
pay
and
if
that
is
the
only
way
that
we
can
accomplish
that
result;
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the,
what
underlies
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
testified
against
them
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
17
years
old
at
that
time,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
taking
the
whole
record,
however,
as
it
was
accepted
by
the
jury
and
in
the
trial
courts
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
a
fair
statement
that
this
man,
if
you
adopt
justice
cardozo’s
statement,
is
to
go
free
because
of
the
constable
blunder,
or
is
not
that
fair?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
standards
that
have
existed
up
to
this
time
on
the
exclusionary
doctrine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
fundamental
proposition
of
the
validity
of
the
exclusionary
doctrine
is
found
and
determined
now,
not
to
be
warranted
by
the
constitution,
then
the
ball
bounces
the
other
way,
does
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
in
the
alternative
in
what
the
attorney
general
described
as
one
of
his
alternative
positions,
if
that
is
an
issue
that
cannot
be
raised
in
federal
habeas
corpus
at
all,
then
i
am
sure
the
result
follows?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cunningham,
mr.
justice
stewart
has
given
rise
to
one
view
and
i
would
not
undertake
to
say
whether
it
is
the
majority
view
or
not
of
the
function
of
a
trial,
that
is
a
search
for
truth,
but
are
you
not
by
implication
articulating
the
contrary
view
that
the
trial
in
a
criminal
case
is
a
search
for
admissible
truth,
admissible
truth,
not
truth
in
the
abstract?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
and
except
then
the
--
one
of
these
two
alternatives
is
that
then
surely
you
must
agree
with
justice
stewart
that
the
exclusionary
rule
frustrates,
defeats
the
search
for
truth
as
this
case
so
richly
demonstrates?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
procedure,
not
on
substance,
it
is
a
check
on
procedure
to
seek
to
it
that
the
only
evidence
that
comes
in
is
evidence
acquired
in
accordance
with
constitution
as
construed
by
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
as
a
result,
ultimately,
justice
cardozo’s
prophecy
came
true
that
on
some
occasions,
the
federal
courts
have
excluded
the
actual
evidence
of
the
body
of
the
murder
victim
because
of
the
way
in
which
the
police
learned
the
location
of
the
concealed
body,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
to
do
with
the
core
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
dynamite
and
the
caps
and
all
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
dynamite
fragments
in
the
cuts
of
his
pants
planted
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
your
reference
to
rochin,
inevitably
brings
up
the
question
of
schmerberg
case,
where
it
did
not
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court
to
put
a
needle
in
the
man’s
veins
and
withdraw
a
sufficient
amount
of
blood
to
determine
the
alcoholic
intake
of
the
man
at
that
period.
so
that
--
does
that
not
suggest
that
even
at
the
risk
of
oversimplification
that
the
same
processes
which
brought
new
light
on
the
constitution,
let
us
as
say
20
years
ago,
might
bring
new
light
on
the
constitution
today?

e.

penalty
when
we
reverse
another
court
mr.
cunningham,
[laughs]
(inaudible)
might
just
welcome
the
ultimate
justice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
supreme
court
decision
on
the
issue
is
res
judicata
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
not
--
as
a
consequence
of
that
the
collateral
attack
is
barred
on
traditional
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
assume,
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
magistrate
who
issued
the
warrant
was
the
same
judicial
officer
who
passed
on
the
suppression
motion,
and
you
say
that
that
is
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
cunningham,
thank
you
mr.
kammerlohr.
