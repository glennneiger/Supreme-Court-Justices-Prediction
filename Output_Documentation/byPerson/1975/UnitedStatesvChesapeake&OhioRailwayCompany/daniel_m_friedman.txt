mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
that
is
here
on
a
direct
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
is
whether
on
the
railroads
tell
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
need
an
increase
in
rates
for
a
particular
purpose.
the
commission
has
authority
of
a
(inaudible)
increase
to
tell
the
railroads,
they
have
to
use
the
money
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
seek
it.
more
precisely,
the
issue
is
whether
in
this
case
the
railroads'
representation
that
they
need
a
substantial
increase
in
rates
in
order
to
accomplish
deferred
maintenance
and
delayed
capital
improvements,
justified
the
commission
when
it
gave
this
rate
in
telling
the
railroads,
they
had
to
use
the
additional
revenues
derived
from
the
increase
that
were
authorized
for
that
purpose.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
three
railroads,
colloquially
the
chessie
system,
it
is
the
baltimore
and
ohio,
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
and
the
western
maryland
railroad.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
are
indeed
mr.
justice.
the
reason
the
others
are
noticeable
for
their
absence
is
only
the
chessie
system
challenged
the
action
of
the
commission
in
this
case.
the
other
railroads
all
accepted
the
commission’s
condition
that
i
would
come
to,
in
a
moment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
do
not
say,
they
do,
however,
a
number
of
them
are
quite
prosperous
as
well
as
the
chessie.
that
they
do
not
make
that
argument
and
indeed
it
is
the
thrust
of
my
submission
to
this
court
would
be
that
it
was
all
the
railroads,
as
i
will
come
to
them,
there
was
all
the
railroads
that
came
in
and
said
we
have
this
need
for
the
deferred
maintenance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
including
the
chessie,
yes
mr.
justice.
let
me
come
right
to
that.
the
case
began
in
april
of
1974,
when
virtually
all
the
railroads
in
this
country,
with
one
exception
i
believe,
all
of
the
railroads
filed
a
petition
with
the
commission
saying
that
they
needed
a
10%
across
the
board
increase
in
freight
rates
and
among
the
railroads
who
submitted
this
petition
was
the
chessie.
the
chessie,
the
three
chessie
companies,
were
explicitly
listed
in
an
appendix
to
this
petition
as
among
those
on
whose
behalf
it
was
filed
and
chessie's
counsel
mr.
rettberg
who
appears
here
on
their
behalf
on
the
brief,
was
one
of
those
whose
name
appeared
on
the
cover
of
this
document
of
the
petition
and
at
the
conclusion
of
it.
so
that
the
chessie
associated
itself
completely
with
all
of
the
railroads'
submissions
with
respect
to
the
need
for
this
additional
revenue.
now,
what
did
the
railroads
tell
the
commission
with
respect
to
why
they
needed
the
revenue?
the
petition
said,
“massive
additional
expenditures
are
required
for
maintenance
and
capital
improvement,”
that
is
at
the
page
107
of
the
appendix.
there
is
a
caption
in
the
petition
at
page
109
which
is
called,
“the
problems
of
the
industry,”
as
described
by
railroad
chief
executives
and
operating
officers.
this
section
contained
a
number
of
statements
by
various
officials
of
the
country's
railroads,
not
officials
of
the
chessie,
but
a
number
of
important
officials,
describing
the
extent
and
seriousness
to
the
railroads
of
the
problems
of
the
deferred
maintenance
and
delayed
capital
improvements.
for
example,
i
just
give
one
or
two
illustrative
statements,
but
there
are
a
number
of
them
in
there,
they
spoke
of
--
one
railroad
spoke
of
the
plant
deterioration,
decline
in
car
fleet
and
increase
in
un-serviceable
cars
that
have
resulted
from
inadequate
cash
flow.
another
spoke
of
years
of
inadequate
spending
on
maintenance
of
facilities
in
way,
another
is
about
insufficient
maintenance
expenditures
in
the
past,
and
there
was
attached
to
this
petition,
excerpts
from
a
report
that
had
been
made,
the
so
called
“astral
report,”
dealing
with
the
financial
problems
that
the
nation's
railroads
were
facing.
and
it
said
that
the
railroad's
current
difficulty
in
needing
the
needs
for
service
can
be
traced
directly
to
more
than
a
decade
of
inadequate
earnings
which
have
forced
major
cutbacks
in
capital
spending
and
maintenance
programs,
that
is
at
177
of
the
appendix.
now,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
tariff
such
as
this
that
is
filed,
becomes
affective
within
30
days,
unless
the
commission
acts
to
suspend
it,
which
as
this
court
is
aware
it
can
do
for
up
to
seven
months.
in
this
case,
the
railroads
because
of
a
claimed
--
their
claimed
need
for
emergency
revenues
as
fast
as
possible,
asked
the
commission
to
permit
these
tariffs
to
become
effective
on
10
days
notice.
the
commission
declined
to
do
this.
it
instituted
an
investigation
into
the
legality
of
the
increases
and
suspended
the
tariffs,
but
it
authorized
the
carriers
to
themselves
cancel
the
tariff
that
had
been
suspended
and
to
file
a
new
substitute
tariff
at
no
higher
rates
than
those
provided
in
the
original
tariff
and
now
i
quote
the
exact
words
of
the
commission
at
pages
45a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
“subject
to
the
following
conditions.”
now,
i
stress
the
words
“subject
to
the
following
conditions”
because
the
chessie's
contention
here
is
that
the
orders
the
commission
initially
issued,
requiring
these
conditions,
were
not
really
a
condition
at
all.
they
were
merely
a
hortatory
suggestion
by
the
commission
that
it
was
exhorting
the
railroads
to
do
this.
at
page
46a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
under
these
conditions
listed,
paragraph
number
three
states,
“revenues
generated
by
the
increases
should
be
expended
for
capital
improvements
and
deferred
maintenance
of
plant
and
equipment
and
the
amount
needed
for
increased
material
and
supply
cost
other
than
fuel.”
then
over
at
the
top
of
page
48a
of
the
appendix,
the
first
sentence
in
the
middle
of
it,
the
same
thought
is
repeated.
“the
commission
intends
that
revenues
generated
by
increases,
authorized
herein
over
and
above
the
amounts
for
increased
material
and
supply
cost
other
than
fuel,
will
be
used
by
the
respondents
exclusively
for
reducing
deferred
maintenance
of
plant
and
equipment
and
delayed
capital
improvements
in
order
that
rail
service
to
the
shippers
will
be
improved.”
then
two
sentences
down
the
commission
stated,
“the
respondent’s
failure
to
apply
the
increased
revenues
as
heretofore
specified,
will
result
in
the
cancellation
of
this
authorized
increases.”
the
commission
made
one
other
significant
determination
earlier
in
this
order
at
pages
42a
and
43a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
beginning
on
the
last
line
of
42a,
the
commission
said,
“the
increase
is
proposed
were,
if
permitted
to
become
effective,
generate
additional
revenues
sufficient
to
enable
the
carriers
to
prevent
further
deterioration
and
improved
service,”
and
then
it
said,
“however,
if
the
schedules
were
permitted
to
become
effective
as
filed
and
without
conditions
designed
to
promote
service
improvements,
the
increases
proposed
would
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
the
national
transportation
policies.”
so
it
was
because
of
these
reasons
that
the
commission
imposed
this
condition
to
granting
of
the
increase.
the
next
day,
after
the
commission
entered
this
order,
all
the
railroads
filed
the
new
amended
tariff,
containing
basically
with
one
or
two
minor
exceptions,
the
increases
provided
for
in
the
earlier
tariff
and
this
new
tariff
became
effective
in
15
days.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
railroads
are
estopped.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
since,
if
the
chessie,
in
fact,
did
not
have
any
deferred
maintenance
or
delayed
capital
improvements,
at
that
point
it
could
have
refused
to
accept
this
increase
itself
because
of
these
conditions.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
chessie
fully
participated
with
all
the
other
railroads
and
that
the
commission
was
justified
in
these
circumstances
as
i
would
come
to
in
a
moment
in
imposing
this
condition
upon
all
of
the
railroads.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that
is
the
question
and
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
what
--
the
only
thing
the
court
of
appeals,
district
court
decided
in
this
case
was
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
do
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
we
suggest
in
our
a
briefs
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
that,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
pass
upon
chessie’s
attacks
on
the
application
of
this
condition
to
it.
it
suggests
it
is
in
somewhat
different
position.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
would
be
mr.
justice
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first,
if
the
chessie
had
made
that
submission,
the
commission
might
not
have
granted
the
chessie
the
increase.
it
might
have
decided
that
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
treat
the
chessie
different.
we
do
not
know.
we
do
not
know,
but
they
might
not
have
done
it,
but
if
--
i
think,
it
will
be
a
much
more
difficult
case,
if
the
chessie
said
that
and
the
commission
said,
“never
mind,
we
think
the
rates
have
to
be
uniform
throughout,”
but
i
think,
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
because
let
me
make
something
right
at
the
outset.
we
make
no
claim,
contrary
to
what
the
district
court
suggested
that
the
commission
has
any
general
authority,
any
general
authority
to
tell
the
railroads
how
to
spend
their
money,
that
is
is
what
we
think
the
commission
is
doing
in
this
case.
in
this
case
what
the
commission
did,
was
it
said
that
to
the
extent
these
increased
rates
exceed,
increases
in
cost
which
the
commission
subsequently
said
came
to
3%,
to
the
extent
the
increase
here
exceeded
the
additional
cost,
it
would
be
unjust
and
unreasonable,
unless
the
carriers
applied
the
increases
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
said
they
needed
them,
and
that
is
to
improve
service,
to
improve
service
by
using
the
funds
for
correcting
their
maintenance
deficiencies
and
their
defects
in
capital
improvements,
that
is
our
basic
petition.
now,
let
me
just
briefly
elude
to
three
other
orders
that
the
commission
entered
in
this
case
which
kind
of
fill
out
the
details
of
it.
in
the
subsequent
order
they
defined
what
they
meant
by
capital
deferred
maintenance
and
delayed
capital
improvements.
then
they
subsequently,
in
august
of
1974,
denied
a
petition
for
reconsideration
by
the
chessie
which
proposed
that
the
order
be
amended
to
provide
that
if
any
carrier
had
no
deferred
maintenance
or
delayed
improvements,
it
could
use
the
funds
for
any
valid
corporate
purposes.
and
at
page
88
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
commission
explained
why?
it
said
that
it
is
consistently
expressed
its
full
intention
that
the
authorized
increases
over
and
above
increased
costs
shall
be
used
by
the
respondents
exclusively
for
reducing
the
deferred
maintenance
of
plant
and
equipment
and
delayed
capital
improvements,
in
order
that
rail
service
to
the
shippers
will
be
improved.
it
pointed
out
at
pages
81-82
that
the
petition
and
the
verified
statements
filed
in
this
case
as
it
said
are
replete
with
references
to
the
need
for
revenues,
to
provide
funds
for
great,
but
unspecified
amounts
of
deferred
maintenance
and
capital
improvements.
it
also
pointed
out
at
page
81a
that
its
decision
how
to
apply
the
funds
which
the
commission
had
required
be
segregated
that
the
decision
on
how
to
apply
them
to
what
particular
items
that
deferred
maintenance
or
delayed
capital
improvements
and
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
these
were
necessary,
was
a
decision
left
to
the
railroads.
the
commission,
in
other
words,
is
not
telling
them
how
to
apply
it
or
to
what.
it
just
tells
them
they
had
to
apply
it,
as
they
said,
they
were
going
to
do.
and
finally
in
october
when
some
of
the
railroads
came
in
and
stated
that
they
really
could
not
use
these
funds
for
that
purpose,
the
commission
said,
“well,
any
railroad
that
cannot
apply
all
of
the
increase
under
this
order
for
deferred
maintenance
or
delayed
capital
improvements,
may
with
the
permission
of
the
commission,
expend
it
for
new
and
additional
capital
improvements.”
under
that
provision,
a
number
of
railroads
have
been
authorized
by
the
commission
to
expend
the
funds
generated
by
this
increase
to
new
capital
improvements
where
they
convinced
the
commission
that
they
had
no
deferred
or
delayed
maintenance
or
capital
improvements
and
all
that.
i
think,
it
is
somewhat
significant
that
although
chessie
keeps
telling
us
now
that
it
has
no
deferred
maintenance
or
delayed
capital
improvements,
it
has
never
sought
the
permission
or
authorization
of
the
commission
to
expend
the
funds
challenged
under
this
order
which
is
known
in
railroad
jargon
as
ex
parte
305.
the
three-judge
district
court,
in
setting
aside
the
commission's
order,
said
two
things
before
it
came
to
its
actual
decision.
it
said
first
of
all
that
it
had
no
doubt
that
chessie’s
facilities
require
additional
maintenance
and
improvement,
that
is
at
page
15a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
pointed
out
that
over
a
10-year
period
from
1964-1973,
the
number
of
annual
derailments
of
these
carriers
had
increased
to
a
176%
from
87-240.
the
court
also
described
the
commission’s
action
and
i
quote
again
from
page
22a
as,
“a
well
intentioned
effort
to
cope
with
the
vexatious
deterioration
of
track
and
equipment
that
saps
the
ability
of
the
nation's
railroads
to
serve
the
public
adequately.”
however,
relying
on
decisions
of
this
court,
two
old
decisions,
which
it
saw
as
establishing
the
proposition
that
the
commission
has
no
general
power
to
control
the
railroad's
expenditures,
it
said
that
the
congress
had
not
authorized
the
commission
to
control
the
carrier's
expenditure
of
funds
as
a
condition
to
withholding
the
suspension
of
rates.
now,
as
i
have
said
previously,
we
think
the
district
court
misunderstood
in
the
case
and
approached
it
incorrectly.
the
commission
is
not
attempting
here
to
tell
the
railroads
how
could
they
ought
to
expend
their
funds,
generally.
all
it
is
saying
to
the
railroads
is
that
when
they
told
the
commission
that
they
need
additional
funds
for
a
particular
purpose
in
order
to
provide
adequate
service,
the
commission
can
say
to
them,
“yes,
if
that
is
what
you
need
the
funds
for,
you
may
have
those
funds,
provided
you
do
with
them
what
you
have
told
us
you
intend
to
do
it
with
them.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
not
to
my
knowledge,
but
let
me
point
out
something
in
this
case.
that
there
are
some
evidence
in
the
record
at
page
54a,
a
dissenting
opinion
of
commissioner
o’neil
at
one
stage
of
the
proceedings,
in
which,
he
points
out
that
in
the
past,
the
commission
had
given
a
large
number
of
increases
to
the
carriers
and
that
although
they
admonished
the
carriers
to
use
this
money
to
improve
their
service,
the
carriers
had
not
done
it.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
in
this
case,
protests
by
shippers
in
which
they
said
that
there
have
been
a
lot
of
these
increases
and
the
railroads
were
always
making
these
promises,
you
should
protect
the
shippers
by
doing
something
to
make
sure
that
the
railroads
carry
out
their
commitments.
i
refer
to
pages
213
of
the
appendix
where
the
national
industrial
traffic
league,
probably
the
leading
organization
of
shippers
in
this
country,
urged
the
commission
to
that
and
also
at
215
and
221,
where
two
large
shippers
made
this
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
first
page
is
213,
mr.
chief
justice,
then
215,
and
221.
now,
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
commission
had
stated
that
if
the
increased
rates
in
this
case
were
not
applied
with
conditions
designed
to
promote
service
improvements,
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
the
national
transportation
policy
which
is
a
prelude
or
preface
to
the
statute
itself
and
was
created
and
enacted
in
1940,
directs
that
all
provisions
of
the
act
be
administered
with
a
view
to
carrying
out
that
policy
and
one
element
of
that
policy
listed
is
the
promotion
and
preservation
of
safe,
adequate
and
efficient
service.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
an
essential
and
important
element
of
safe,
adequate,
and
efficient
service
is
to
ensure
that
the
carriers
do
provide
adequate
maintenance
of
their
plant
and
equipment
and
to
make
the
necessary
capital
investments
in
order
to
haul
the
shipper's
goods.
we
find
this
authority
of
the
commission
to
impose
this
commission
in
the
broad
contours
of
section
15a
(2)
of
the
act,
which
directs
the
commission
in
exercising
its
power
to
prescribe
just
and
reasonable
rates
to
consider
the
need
in
the
public
interest
of
adequate
and
efficient
railway
transportation
service
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
with
the
furnishing
of
that
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
if
it
clearly
forbade
it
mr.
justice,
because
if
it
clearly
forbade
it,
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
think
if
the
statute
were
amended
to
change
it,
so
after
this
order,
i
do
not
think
that
would
invalidate
this
order.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
the
time,
yes.
we
do
not
think
the
amendments
to
this
statute
have
changed
the
commission’s
power
in
this
respect,
but
this
order
was
entered
under
the
old
section,
and
the
new
statute
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
be
a
difficult
question,
mr.
justice,
i
think.
but
that
is
not
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
is
a
substitute
provision.
there
is
a
substitute
provision
which
applies
in
the
future.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know.
i
would
not
say
it
is
necessarily
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it
certainly
does
and
i
would
also
suggest
something
else
mr.
justice,
that
i
think
that
when
people
come
before
a
regulatory
agency
and
say
they
want
the
regulatory
agency
to
authorize
and
to
give
them
authority
to
do
something
for
a
particular
purpose,
when
the
agency
gives
them
that
authority,
it
has
inherent
power
to
condition
it
and
say,
“yes,
you
can
do
it,
but
you
have
to
do
for
the
purpose
which
led
us
to
give
you
the
authority.”
that
it
seems
to
us
is
an
inherent
power
of
the
administrative
agencies,
that
when
they
are
asked
to
do
something,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
should
be
able
to
tell
the
parties,
“yes,
we
are
going
to
do
what
you
have
asked
us
to
do
and
we
are
in
turn
going
to
require
you
to
fulfill
your
commitment
to
us
that
that
is
the
reason
you
want
it.”
the
whole
history
which
we
have
traced
in
our
brief
of
the
amendments,
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
beginning
with
the
transportation
act
of
1940
and
some
of
this
court’s
decision
in
the
interim,
indicate
a
history
on
the
part
of
congress
which
is
attempting
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
commission,
in
trying
to
enable
the
railroads
to
provide
better
services,
it
started,
originally
as
a
mere
rate
making
function
and
now
it
has
been
developed
and
developed
to
the
point
that
there
is
a
duty
on
the
commission,
we
think,
to
try
to
foster
a
sound,
efficient
and
economical
transportation
system.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
this
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
it
had
disavowed
the
power,
it
had
disavowed
the
authority
to
directly
tell
the
railroads
how
to
spend
their
money,
to
tell
them
to
in
one
famous
case,
this
court
said
they
could
not
tell
the
railroads
to
buy
tank
cars,
in
another
case
it
said
it
had
no
power
to
tell
the
railroads
to
build
a
terminal
at
los
angeles,
but
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
which
the
commission
was
asked
to
give
a
rate
increase
for
a
particular
purpose,
where
it
had
to
face
up
to
this
problem.
this
--
in
one
sense
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
commission
has
ever
directly
attempted
to
do
this,
but
i
suggest
this
is
the
first
time
really
that
the
problem
has
ever
been
before
the
commission
and
i
think,
it
did
it
in
this
case
because
of
its
experience
in
a
number
of
other
cases
that
after
the
railroads
have
said
they
needed
the
additional
funds
to
improve
service.
it
turned
out
that
the
service
was
not
improved
at
all.
the
deferred
maintenance,
the
delayed
capital
improvements
kept
getting
worse
and
worse
and
that
is
why,
we
think,
the
commission
had
to
step
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
within
the
broad
authority
of
the
commission
to
support
and
further
efficient
and
effective
transportation,
the
commission
had
the
power
in
this
case
to
tell
all
other
railroads
including
chessie
which
joined
in
this
application
that
that
they
had
to
use
the
money
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
said
they
needed
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know.
i
could
not
answer
that.
i
suppose
if
it
got
at
some
point,
they
have
some
safety
authority
and
perhaps,
they
might
be
able
to
require
the
commission
to
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
as
far
as
i
know.
there
is
--
i
know
the
commission
has
some
authority.
i
do
not
know
the
precise
details
to
do
safety
inspections,
and
if
i
suppose
the
rails
got
to
the
point
that
it
was
dangerous
to
run
the
trains
over
them,
i
am
sure
the
commission
would
have
some
authority
to
correct
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
have
four
brief
points.
the
first
one
is
an
informational
one
to
a
question
justice
stevens
put
to
me
yesterday.
on
advise
that
the
supervision
of
the
safety
aspects
of
railroads
has
been
transferred
to
the
department
of
transportation
in
1966.
and
that
the
authority
that
the
commission
previously
had
at
that
time
is
now
used
and
performed
by
the
department
of
transportation
but
the
same
safety
regulation
factor.
mr.
morris
has
said
that
the
commission
for
ten
years
has
been
seeking
from
the
congress,
the
authority,
which
it
now
purports
to
exercise
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
what
the
commission
was
seeking
from
congress,
was
something
very
different.
the
commission
was
seeking
authority
to
prevent
railroads
from
diverting
their
railroad
assets
into
non-transportation
activities.
that
is
what
they
were
talking
about
in
connection
with
the
penn
central.
that
the
penn
central
allegedly
had
been
using
a
lot
of
railroad
revenues
and
railroad
properties
for
non-transportation
purpose.
that
is
a
very
different
thing
from
what
the
commission
is
doing
in
this
case
which
is
to
try
to
ensure
that
the
railroads
use
the
transportation
revenues
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
say
it
is
necessary.
now,
mr.
morris
has
said
that
the
new
statute
denies
the
commission,
its
authority.
we
emphatically
and
vigorously
deny
that.
i
would
like
to
apart
from
the
language
which
we
have
briefly
referred
to
of
the
statute
which
we
think
if
anything
manifests
even
clear
intention
that
congress
intended
the
commission
to
have
the
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
railroads
are
operating
efficiently
and
of
course
ensuring
that
necessary
deferred
maintenance
is
done.
there
is
one
way
to
ensure
that.
but
there
are
two
very
specific
things
with
respect
to
the
statute.
the
first
is
set
forth
in
the
senate
committee
report,
which
is
quoted
in
a
lengthy
footnote
at
pages
17
to
18
of
our
brief,
footnote
number
18.
and
the
first
full
paragraph
in
the
footnote
on
page
18.
and
i
just
quote
that
says,
it
refers
to
a
study
made
by
the
national
city
bank
–
first
national
city
bank
of
the
railroads
problem
said,
the
figures
as
to
the
amount
of
deferred
maintenance
in
the
nations
rail
industry
compiled
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
proceeding
ex
parte
305,
this
very
proceeding
substantially
comport
with
the
5.7
billion
found
by
fncb
in
its
study.
in
other
words,
congress
recognized
in
enacting
this
statute
that
the
railroads
had
a
very
serious
problem
in
connection
with
deferred
maintenance.
and
along
with
that,
there
is
a
provision
of
the
new
statute
which
is
section
504
which
is
contained
in
public
law
94,
section
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
not
in
our
brief
because
the
statute
had
just
been
enacted
the
time
we
filed
our
reply
-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
it
is
public
law
94-210,
section
504(a).
and
its
page
40
of
this
little
printed
version
of
the
act
that
is
around.
and
that
provision
expressly
directs
the
railroads
within
18
months,
after
the
enactment
of
this
statute
to
report
to
the
secretary
of
transportation
or
class
one
railroads,
the
total
deferred
maintenance
and
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
enable
the
secretary
to
allocate
from
the
fund
that
has
been
created
announced
that
will
help
the
railroads
in
claiming
up
this
deferred
maintenance.
now
its
seems
to
us
incredible
to
believe
that
at
the
same
time
that
the
congress
was
attempting
to
strengthen
the
statute
to
enable
the
commission
to
deal
more
effectively
with
the
problems
of
the
railroads.
and
it
recognized
the
vast
amounts
of
deferred
maintenance
and
also
took
steps
to
ensure
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
would
be
able
to
channel
funds
for
that
purpose
by
requiring
the
railroads
to
report
the
amounts
of
deferred
maintenance.
that
at
the
same
time
it
would
have
cut
off
the
commissions
power
when
the
railroads
told
them
they
needed
the
money
for
deferred
maintenance
that
congress
could
have
said,
no,
you
cannot
do
that.
that
just
seems
to
us
impossible
to
believe
that
that
is
what
it
was
intended
and
i
stress
the
whole
question
here
is
the
question
of
the
commission's
power.
whether
or
not
the
chessie
did
or
did
not
have
deferred
maintenance
is
not
the
issue
before
this
court.
as
i
previously
mentioned
yesterday,
the
district
court
recognized
that
chessie
needed
additional
maintenance.
the
sole
question
is
the
question
of
power.
and
we
submit
that
the
commission
most
certainly
has
the
power
when
the
railroads
and
all
the
railroads
tell
it,
it
needs
this
money
for
deferred
maintenance.
to
say
that
the
railroads,
yes,
we
are
giving
it
to
you
but
you
have
got
to
use
it
for
the
purposes
for
which
you
said
you
needed
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suggested
that
at
the
time
the
commission
acted,
at
the
time
the
commission
acted,
that
is
all
they
had
before
it.
but
since
my
opponent
has
now
urged
that
the
new
statute
denies
the
commissions’
power
is
just
attempting
to
indicate
why
we
think
the
new
statute
if
anything
even
more
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
can
be
decided
on
15a—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
at
the
present
census
act,
the
statute
where
this
order
was
entered
under
15(a)(2),
which
should
be
decided
on
15(a)(2),
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
more
recent
legislation
confirms
the
power
of
the
commission.
i
also
point
out
that
we
do
not
rely
wholly
on
15(a)(2).
we
also
of
course
rely
on
the
national
transportation
policy
and
what
we
considered
to
be
the
inherent
power
of
an
agency
to
tell
people
when
they
ask
the
agency
to
do
something
for
them.
the—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
we
do
not
have
any
question
of
that.
that
the
whole
–
that
statute,
the
whole
statutory
scheme
it
seems
to
us
indicates
that
congress
did
intend
the
commission
to
have
this
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
you
should
first
look
at
15(a)(2).
and
then
if
you
agree
with
us
that
15(a)(2)does
give
the
power
then
the
next
step
i
would
assume
is
to
look
and
see
whether
the
new
statute
15(a)(4)
and
the
other
provisions
change
that
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
court
agrees
with
us,
but
i
think
that
it
is
not
unusual
in
interpreting
a
statute
to
look
to
see
what
later
legislation
has
done
in
terms
of
the—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
in
that
case
and
the
order
does
look
to
the
future.
since
the
order
does
look
to
the
future
and
since
it
has
been
staid
in
the
interim
i
would
suppose
that
would
tend
to
wipe
out
the
order
if
15(a)(4)
expressly
prohibited—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
you
can
look
to
15(a)(2)
now
because
what
congress
has
done
in
the
later
statute,
15(a)(4)
which
was
intended
to
strengthen
the
commissions
hand
has
to
be
viewed—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
in
the
future,
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
but
this
order
was
entered
year-and-a-
half,
two
years—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
are
talking
about
that
the
commissions
power
to
do
this
kind
of
thing.
and
it
seems
to
me
--when
it
did
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
defining
the
commissions
power
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
had
said
that
but
it
has
not
said
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
order
it
seems
to
me
at
the
time
it
was
entered
was
a
valid
order
would
that
regard
to
what
congress
subsequently
said
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
the
order
was
valid
under
15(a)(2)
as
we
think
it
is
and
assuming
that
we
are
only
going
to
look
to
15(a)(2)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
for
this
mr.
justice
that
the
order
is
now
been
staid
and
if
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
but
in
terms
of
the
future
effectiveness
of
the
order,
i
would
assume
that
if
congress
had
a
passed
a
statute
saying
in
effect
cutting
off
the
order
by
saying
that
henceforth
the
commission
cannot
exercise
this
power.
i
will
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
commission
presumably
would
--
i
would
think
it
probably
reconsider
this
order
if
--
because
the
order
speaks
to
the
future.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
imply
that
the
congress
had
power,
yes.
there
is
no
–
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
commission,
if
the
order
is
valid
under
15(a)(2)
when
entered
in
one
stance
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
on
the
other
hand
since
the
present
posture
of
the
case
is
such
that
it
has
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
any
event
because
the
district
court
has
not
passed
upon
some
of
these
other
aspects.
and
since
the
order
is
now
staid,
i
would
think
there
might
be
problems
if
15(a)(4)
and
the
other
provisions
explicitly
provided
that
the
order
that
commission
had
no
longer
has
this
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
fully
agree
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
issue
is
what
power
the
commission
had
at
the
time
it
entered
the
order
and
all
i
was
really
arguing
on
the
subsequent
statute
is
to
answer
the
claim
that
the
subsequent
statute
somehow
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
commission
to
have
this
power
and
it
seems—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
the
rail
--
well
the
railroads
are
required
to
the
commission
how
they
got
these
revenues
and
what
they
are
doing.
and
that
part
of
the
order
was
upheld.
the
district
court
upheld
the
reporting
and
accounting
provisions.
the
only
thing
it
struck
down
was
this
condition
that
they
had
to
use
the
revenues
for
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
although
there
is,
although
of
course
the
commission
as
recognized
in
one
of
its
orders
that
the
carrier
a
considerable
discretion
to
make
the
determination
whether
it
is
or
is
not
deferred
maintenance.
of
course,
there
will
be
continuing
supervision
to
the
extent
the
carriers
come
in
and
ask
for
an
exception
from
the
order
the
provision
i
mentioned
under
which
they
could
use
it
for
purposes
other
than
those
permitted
in
the
order.
but
it
seems
to
me
as
long
as
the
order
is
outstanding,
as
long
as
the
order
is
within
the
commission's
power
then
it
is
for
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
is
an
outstanding
order,
it
is
an
outstanding
order
and
unless
and
until
the
order
is
modified
either
by
the
commission
or
by
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
a
valid
order
that
the
carriers
are
required
to
follow.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
order?
oh,
yes.
the
order
is
in
effect
in
so
far
as
it
requires
the
carriers
to
report
and
also
in
so
far
as
i
assume
as
the
carriers
are
required
to
use
the
money
for
deferred
maintenance
except
with
respect
to
the
chessie
because
only
the
chessie
took
the
case
top
court.
and
only
that
chessie
was
one
that
got
the
temporary
restraining
order,
so
as
far
as
all
the
carriers
are
concerned
and
at
least
the
reports
we
have
in
the
record
indicate
that
they
are
complying.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
order
--
the
operation
of
the
order
has
been
staid
by
the
district
court
with
respect
to
this
condition
but
the
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
with
respect
to
the
chessie.
that
was
been
staid
only
to
chessie
sought
the
stay.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
do
--
with
enforcing
it,
i
am
not
sure
that
has
been
any
need
for
enforcement.
i
would
say,
yes,
mr.
justice
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
were
these
21
or
22
instances
in
which
various
carriers
came
into
the
commission
and
asked
for
exceptions
from
the
order
and
the
commission
granted
some
and
rejected
others.
so,
i
would
say
the
order
is
in
effect.
it
is
just
that
it
was
with
respect
to
the
chessie
because
of
the
stay,
that
chessie
has
been
not
required
to
observe
the
conditions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
so.
i
would
have
to
check
the
dates
on
that.
they
are
all
–
the
orders
are
all
set
out
in
the
–
i
think
since
the
date
that
the
temporary
restraint
--
certainly
since
the
date
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
because
after
the
temporary
restraining
order
the
commission
issued
its
last
order
in
october
and
the
chessie
then
amended
its
complaint
to
include
that
order.
and
in
that
order
the
commissions
gave
the
instances
in
which
it
had
granted
or
denied
these
exceptions.
so
the
order
will
staid
i
would
say
with
respect
to
the
chessie
prior
to
the
time
that
commission
had
finished
the
case.
