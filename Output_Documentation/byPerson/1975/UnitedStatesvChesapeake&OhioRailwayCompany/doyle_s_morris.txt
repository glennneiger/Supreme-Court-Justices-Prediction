mr.
doyle
s.
morris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
finally
established
that
yes,
this
was
the
very
first
time
in
80
plus
years
of
history
and
secondly,
i
would
submit
that,
mr.
justice
white
put
his
finger
on
the
entire
case
when
he
asked,
well,
suppose
15a
(2)
had
been
changed
to
make
this
unlawful.
the
fact
is
that
15a
(2)
has
quite
recently
in
the
rail
revitalization
act
for
1976,
been
made
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
completely
inapplicable
to
the
railroads.
now,
the
result
of
that
is
of
crucial
importance
because
it
is
not
barely
15a
(2)
on
which
the
commission
and
the
government
has
relied
as
a
source
of
their
claimed
implication
of
power,
was
a
reason
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
we
make
every
possible
justification
where
the
merits
of
case
would
sustain.
let
me
tell
you
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
that
is
one.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
it
is
not
exclusively,
but
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
it
could
be
a
primary
case.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
we
advanced
in
this
case
and
we
freely
admit,
with
parties
to
this
application.
further
we
have
dwelled
upon
the
low
level
of
earnings
in
this
industry,
terribly
depressed
and
the
result
of
that
we
pointed
out,
was
yes.
that
had
resulted
in
the
deferral
of
the
maintenance,
yes,
that
had
resulted
in
the
deferral
of
the
improvements
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
it
certainly
would,
it
would
indeed
and
we
also
point
it
to
a
number
of
things
in
support
of
the
application.
increased
cost
of
operations,
increased
cost
of
borrowing
money
as
your
honor
has
just
suggested.
do
they
to
expand
and
grow,
under
the
general
burden
of
inflation.
a
broad
variety
of
grounds
asserted
and
supported
this
application.
again,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
cases
of
this
court
teaches
that
a
change
in
the
law
maybe
relied
upon
by
an
appellant
in
support
of
this
judgment.
we
are
obviously
entitled
to
rely
on
the
new
section
15a
(4),
the
new
rule
of
rate
making
which
congress
has
substituted
for
the
old
rule
of
rate
making,
in
support
of
our
judgment
and
this
court
would
have
to
observe
the
new
rule
even
if
we
did
not
talk
about
it,
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
today.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
would
not
be
here
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
am
here,
and
the
main
reason
is
because
never
in
the
history
of
rate
making
power
from
its
very
inception
in
1906
in
the
hepburn
act
has
the
rate
making
power
ever
extended
to
anything
beyond
the
fixing
of
the
rate.
it
has
never
before
this
order
of
1974
been
attempted
to
be
applied
to
the
control,
of
the
use
of
the
revenues
after
they
were
collected.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
the
case
of
need
was
made,
your
honor.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
it
can
fix
the
rate.
that
is
its
part,
exactly.
it
cannot
tell
us
what
to
do
with
the
money
when
collected.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
yes,
it
does.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
the
commission
has
kept
control
over
this
entire
proceeding.
the
commission
could
pull
the
string
on
this
rate
increase
today,
your
honor.
it
has
kept
control
over
it.
it
has
required
the
reports
and
i
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
it
could
declare
that
it
was
unjust
and
unreasonable.
now,
i
do
not
suggest
for
a
minute
that
that
would
be
appropriate
step,
but
it
has
that
power
in
the
naked
raw
sense
which
required
reports
of
carriers
as
their
investments
and,
how
they
have
used
the
funds?
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
well,
i
do
not
believe
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
a
practical
model
and
the
practical
application
of
the
act
that
in
most
terms,
i
do
not
believe
the
commission
would
consider
doing
that
for
the
obvious
reasons
described
in
the
government’s
brief.
that
would
mean
dislocations
in
the
rate
structure
and
we
will
get
out
of
the
business
and
the
poor
roads
would
be
poorer.
so,
i
would
like
to
dwell
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
perhaps,
i
did
not
get
the
thrust
of
our
question.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
the
commission
would
have
the
power,
if
it
felt
that
chessie
was
not
entitled
to
the
money
and
had
not
made
a
showing
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
in
theory,
yes.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
now,
what
does
the
new
rule
of
rate
making
tell
the
commission
to
do?
the
rule
of
rate
making
is
addressed
exclusively
to
the
point
that
the
commission
should
establish
adequate
revenue
levels,
and
for
what
purposes,
among
others,
to
assure
a
flow
of
net
income
and
depreciation,
to
provide
the
carriers
with
ability
to
invest
in
prudent,
prudent
capital
improvements,
not
deferred
or
delayed
capital
improvements.
moreover,
it
instructs
the
commission,
gives
the
commission,
the
affirmative
duty
to
be
sure
that
adequate
levels
of
revenue
are
established
so
as
to
cover
quote
“total
operating
expenses,”
mere
suggestion
it
would
be
limited
to
any
particular
type
of
operating
expense,
such
as
deferred
maintenance.
i
think,
the
case
can
be
stated
lest
by
giving
here
an
illustration
of
what
has
really
happened.
as
counsel
for
the
government
told
you,
the
carriers
are
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
concluded
last
evening,
it
had
been
established
that
section
15(a)(2)
is
gone,
it
is
no
long
--
congress
has
made
it
no
longer
applicable
to
the
railroads.
and
you
will
recall
that
that
was
the
section,
that
was
the
source
upon
which
the
government
and
the
commission
relied
for
there
source
of
implied
power.
so
it
appears
that
the
appellants
in
terms
of
statutes
had
nowhere
else
to
go
because
the
new
rule
of
rate
making
expressed
in
new
section
15(a)(4)
makes
it
clearer
than
ever
that
the
rate
making
power
cannot
be
expanded
by
implication
in
to
the
power
to
impose
conditions
controlling
the
use
of
carriers’
revenues.
one
or
two
examples
will—
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
i
take
it
they
do
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
i
take
it
they
do
not
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
any
reading,
just
a
casual
reading
of
new
15(a)2
for
which
appears
at
page
2
of
our
supplemental
brief
establishes
once
and
for
all,
that
the
congress
has
imposed
upon
the
commission
an
affirmative
duty
to
establish
revenue
levels
for
the
carriers
which
will
among
other
things
cover
“total
operating
expenses”.
and
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
give
your
honors
a
couple
of
examples
that
will
readily
illustrate
how
the
claim
power
cannot
be
implied
from
this
new
statute.
at
appendix
467
and
473,
you
will
find
the
cases
that
the
dtni,
the
dtni
is
at
467,
the
utah
railway
is
at
473,
each
of
these
carriers
applied
under
their
commissions
305
orders
for
permission
to
use
these
revenues
for
operating
expenses.
and
what
happened?
they
were
turned
down.
now
the
milwaukee
case
tells
us
even
more.
the
milwaukee
case
appears
at
page
477.
the
milwaukee
was
desperately
had
put
for
cash
and
it
applied
to
the
commission
under
its
order
for
permission
to
use
these
funds
for
operating
expenses.
after
two
months
of
deliberation,
the
commission
finally
grudgingly
agreed
to
give
such
consent
but
upon
conditions.
so
at
once
we
see
further
new
conditions
superimposed
upon
the
conditions
that
are
here
challenged
at
bar.
and
what
were
these
two
new
superimposed
conditions?
one,
that
the
milwaukee’s
transfer
from
its
account
716,
that
is
special
reserve
fund
that
the
commission
had
decreed
to
its
other
pocket
in
account
701
cash
that
had
to
be
regarded
if
you
please
as
i
quote
“borrowing”
and
such
borrowing
could
endure
subject
to
the
commission
and
had
to
be
repaid
upon
the
commission’s
further
order.
and
the
second
condition
was
while
this
borrowing
was
outstanding,
the
milwaukee
could
not
be
permitted
to
transfer
any
assets
of
any
kind
to
its
parent
company
or
to
any
of
its
affiliates
or
subsidiaries
without
the
commission's
permission.
now,
in
imposing
this
second
condition,
the
commission
was
exercising
a
power
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
steadfastly
refused
to
grant
it
over
a
period
of
a
decade,
for
more
than
a
decade.
the
commission
has
been
up
on
the
hill
trying
to
sell
a
bill
that
would
give
it
jurisdiction
over
it
just
as
very
tight
of
inter-company
transactions
and
the
congress
in
a
full
decade
has
not
even
given
them
a
hearing
on
that
bill.
so
this
illustrates
what
can
happen.
it
illustrates
that
unlawful,
unauthorized
action
breeds
upon
itself
and
leads
to
further
unauthorized
actions.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
very
much
so,
certainly
your
honor.
and
we
agree
entirely.
but
the
point
i
should
like
to
make
is—
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
their
representations
to
the
congress
were
quite
to
the
contrary,
they
have
made
extensive
representations
which
they
say,
they
do
not
have
any
power
whatever.
we
cite
them
in
our
brief,
to
control
or
prohibit
or
deny
inter-corporate
transactions
over
the
payment
of
dividends,
transfer
of
assets,
what
have
you.
and
they
claim
that
this
is
a
serious
problem
that
they
ought
to
have
be
given
jurisdiction
to
say,
yes,
you
may
make
such
a
transfer,
no,
you
may
not,
it
should
be
rescinded
etcetera.
extensive
jurisdiction
over
such
transfers
and
the
congress
has
not
accorded
it.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
they
have.
they
have
related
it
to
the
well-known
disaster
of
the
penn
central
and
it
is
interesting
to
find
that
---
among
expert
bodies
who
have
studied
this
subject
including
the
commission's
own
staff,
there
is
no
conclusive
evidence
that
the
fact
that
the
penn
central
had
a
conglomerate
structure
as
such,
had
any
bearing
whatever
upon
its
going
bankrupt.
but
this
is
a
type
of
thing
that
the
commission
has
been
asserting
in
support
of
the
bill
that
has
been
lobbying
for
a
decade
and
not
having
been
given
a
hearing.
but
nonetheless,
in
this
proceeding
they
exercised
that
power
that
has
been
denied
them
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
it
illustrates
simply
this
your
honors,
that
under
a
statute
such
as
new
15a(4)
which
imposes
an
affirmative
duty
to
establish
a
revenue
levels
that
will
cover
total
operating
expenses.
one
simply
cannot
imply
a
power
from
that
kind
of
a
statute
that
would
give
the
commission
the
right
to
withhold
revenues
from
the
coverage
of
operating
expenses.
the
two
propositions
go
manifestly
180
degrees
in
the
opposite
direction.
thus,
we
find
that
the
congress
has
drawn
a
bright
line
of
distinction
between
the
rate
making
power,
the
power
to
establish
revenue
levels
on
the
one
hand
and
power
to
dictate
the
use
and
control
the
use
of
the
revenues
on
the
other.
the
latter
has
been,
we
respectfully
submit,
denied.
well,
where
does
the
commission
go
from
there?
no
statute
to
rely
on.
all
we
hear
is
the
presentation,
the
railroads
made
“promises”
may
ought
to
be
held
to
their
promises.
yesterday,
i
reviewed
the
facts
that
there
were
no
such
promises.
that
in
addition
to
the
deferred
maintenance
and
delayed
capital
improvements
that
applicants
presented
a
broad
array
of
facts
in
support
of
their
rate
increase
case.
the
point,
i
suggest
to
you
gentlemen
is
simply
this.
even
if
it
were
true,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
carrier's
entire
case
in
support
of
their
ex
parte
305
request
for
a
rate
increase
had
rested
on
their
claim
need
for
“deferred
maintenance”
and
“delayed
capital
improvements”
even
as
narrowly
defined
later
on
by
the
commission.
still
the
fact
would
remain
that
private
parties
cannot
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
commission
which
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
denied.
we
rely
on
the
fundamental
maxim
that
jurisdiction
cannot
be
created
by
consent.
it
is
for
the
congress
to
state
the
commission’s
powers
and
not
for
the
carriers
to
confer
any
power
whatever.
so
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
we
were
a
party
to
the
application
and
we
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
we
will
take
full
responsibility
for
whatever
was
said
in
the
application.
although
we
ourselves
made—
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
my
answer
is
yes.
although,
we
ourselves
made
it
clear
in
our
one
little
exhibit
that
we
did
not
intend
to
spend
a
penny
more
on
maintenance.
we
did
extend
to
spend
huge
amounts
on
capital
improvements.
we
had
a
$
300
million
capital
improvement
program.
but
we
made
it
quite
clear
that
as
of
then
we
had
no
intent
to
apply
any
of
the
funds
to
maintenance.
while
–
as
it
is
turned
out
of
course
we
have
spent
many,
many
millions
on
maintenance.
but
as
of
that
time
that
was
our
intent.
so
in
the
final
analysis
--
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
no
sir.
we
were
parties
to
the
application.
we
accept
full
responsibility
for
everything
that
was
said.
the
overwriting
point
remains—
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
that
is
one
of
the
reasons,
exactly.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
not
to
deferred
maintenance
as
later
defined
by
the
commission.
we
spend
millions
of
dollars
in
maintenance
and
that
means
obviously
we
have
huge
maintenance
needs.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
not
everything.
we
had
no
deferred
maintenance
as
such
but
we
have
tremendous
maintenance
needs,
tremendous.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
the
application
did
not
pin
point
chessie
as
such.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
no,
not
as
such.
it
said
the
railroads
as
a
group
had
extremely
depressed
earnings
level
and
that
that
depressed
earnings
level
had
lead
to
extensive
deferral
of
maintenance
and
expensive
deferral
of
capital
improvements.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
yes,
yes.
it
was
among
a
variety
of
reasons
which
i
set
forth
yesterday
in
support
of
the
entire
application.
the
entire
industry
of
course
had
an
extremely
depressed
earnings
level
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
united
states
for
the
year
1973
when
the
carriers
had
their
most
tremendous
volume
of
business
ever,
the
rate
of
return
on
that
investment
in
the
eastern
district
was
just
a
little
over
one-half
of
one
percent.
and
with
the
increase
it
would
become
still
less
than
three
percent.
that
was
the
need.
and
the
commission
found,
if
you
please,
the
commission
found
that
the
carriers
needed
the
revenues
and
without
the
increase
the
carriers
would
not
have
sufficient
revenues
to
provide
the
country
with
adequate
services
as
required
by
the
statute.
but
not
withstanding
that
finding
which
was
a
paraphrase
of
the
then
controlling
statute,
the
commission
nonetheless
determine
to
embark
upon
a
revolutionary
step
to
control
the
use
of
the
revenues.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
i
suppose
not
your
honor.
the
basic
statutory
finding
at
that
time
was
as
you
know
in
terms
of
carrier
need
which
as
you
wrote
in
scrap
2
(ph)
is
what
the
commission
focuses
on
in
the
main,
in
its
revenue
cases.
and
that
need
was
certainly
established
here
by
any
standard,
any
standard
whatever.
mr.
doyle
s.
morris
none
was
given.
none
was
asserted
in
terms
of
dividends
directly
but
we
see
the
handwriting
on
the
wall,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
are
here.
i
think,
the
handwriting
is
clear
within
the
milwaukee
case
that
goes
so
far
as
to
reach
dividends
without
congressional
authorization.
so
where
does
that
leave
us?
all
the
commission
has
got
left
to

about

the
national
transportation
policy
and
the
teaching
of
this
court’s
decision
in
arrow
transportation,
372
u.
s.,
it
is
clear
that
the
policy
as
such
simply
does
not
enlarge
the
commission's
substantive
powers.
that
of
course,
would
be
much
too
easy.
all
you
would
need
to
do
would
be
to
rely
on
the
policy
to
do
anything
that
came
to
mind.
you
could
scrap
the
act
and
just
assert
any
power
you
might
wish
and
under
the
policy
in
the
name
of
“adequate,
economic
and
efficient
service.”
the
congress
has
it
made
it
clear,
it
did
not
intend
to
add
and
put
to
the
rate
making
power
by
adoption
of
the
policy.
here
is
the
senate's
report.
the
policy

no
change
in
the

contained

15(a)
of
the

broadening
it
to
apply

carriers.
senate
report,

so
the
transportation
policy
is
not
available
to
the
government,
what
is
left?
nothing,
except
to
talk
in
terms
of
the
power
ought
to
be
implied
because
it
is
reasonable.
the
fact
remains
gentlemen,
congress
has
not
conferred
the
power
and
adjectives
simply
cannot
grant
it.
we
stand
today
in
a
moment
of
choice
in
this
country
between
public
or
private
ownership
of
our
national
railway
system.
congress
was
the
reasoned
enactment
of
the
rail
reorganization
and
revitalization
act
1976
has
spelled
out
the
congressional
policy
in
section
101
(a)
of
that
bill
to
make
it
abundantly
clear.
that
is
the
declared
policy
of
the
congress
that
the
railroads
shall
remain
vigorous
under
the
private
sector
of
the
economy.
thus,
we
find
with
this
comprehensive
enactment
of
this
new
bill
that
congress
is
bending
every
effort
to
keep
the
railroads
liable
in
the
private
sector.
to
avoid
the
huge
burden
on
the
taxpayers
that
will
follow
with
any
other
courts,
we
respectfully
submit
your
honors
that
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
would
provide
monumental
support
to
the
will
of
congress
and
honest,
economical
and
efficient
management
be
permitted
to
manage.
thank
you.
