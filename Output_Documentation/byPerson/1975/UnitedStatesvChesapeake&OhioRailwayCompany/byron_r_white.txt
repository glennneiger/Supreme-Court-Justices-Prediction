justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
did
not
have
the
argument
that
chessie
says
it
has
either.
well,
they
do
not
have
any
differed
maintenance.
i
mean,
they
do
not
say
it
to
anyone
--
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
chessie?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
15a
(2)
had
been
amended
so
that
it
clearly
forbade
this
power?
you
would
not
think
this
condition
would
be
valid
then
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
this
was
a
prior
act
of
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
relying
on
15a
(2)
as
it
read
there
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
should
not
the
new
statute
control?
let
us
suppose
15a
(2)
had
been
amended
to
forbid
this.
now,
why
would
not
the
ordinary
rule
apply
that
the
--
the
law
as
it
now
is
applies?
why
would
not
it
invalidate
an
existing
order
that
--
just
said
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
have
no
power
to
direct
the
railroads
to
use
money
for
maintenance.
would
you
think
this
order
would
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
15a
(2)
does
not
apply
anymore
in
this
situation,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
that
is
even
stronger?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what
about
your
brief
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
commission
has
attempted
to
exercise
its
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
indeed,
before
this
time
it
had
disavowed,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
it
said
the
icc
could
expressly
do
this,
so
you
would
not
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
commission
decided
that
every
railroad
there
in
the
country
needed
it
extremely
badly
except
the
chessie
and
that
chessie
really
did
not
have
any
differed
maintenance,
just
like
it
now
says,
could
it
canceled
it
with
respect
to
the
chessie?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think,
you
did
not
--
you
still
did
not
answer
the
question,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
asked
about
the
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
at
the
outset
if
the
chessie
--
if
the
commission
looked
over
the
papers
that
were
submitted
to
determine,
it
may
increase
and
it
thought
that
the
chessie
really
did
not
need
it
for
the
purpose
that
where
that
was
asserted,
it
could
have
allowed
the
rate
for
everyone
except
the
chessie,
would
it
had
the
power
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
government
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible).
