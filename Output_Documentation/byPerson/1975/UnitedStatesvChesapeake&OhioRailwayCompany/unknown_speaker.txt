unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
that
is
the
way
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
does
the
application
say
actually
apply
with—
unknown
speaker
inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
it
said
everybody
--
.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
will
increase
in
the
revenue,
of
the
earning(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
does
it
mean
any
intention
to
increase
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
not
in
your
brief
?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
should
decide
it
on
15(a)(2).
unknown
speaker
15(a)(2)
or
15(a)(4)?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
has
to
be
done
(inaudible)
say
nevertheless
15(a)(4)
is
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
statutory
scheme?
the
one
in
existence
at
the
time
this
was
done
or
the
on
existence
now?
as
you
say
the
issue
and
the
only
issue
here
and
your
brother
agrees
is
the
issue
of
commission
power
to
do
what
it
did.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
not
a
constitutional
question.
it
is
purely
a
matter
of
did
congress
confer
upon
the
commission
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case.
it
is
awfully
important
to
know
what
statutes
we
are
going
to
look
to
determine
that
question
and
you
--
it
is
kind
of
an
odd
answer.
i
think
you
would
say,
where
do
you
take
your
pick?
15(a)(2),
15(a)(4),
anything
else
you
might
find.
what
do
you
say
we
should
look
at?
unknown
speaker
it
it
was
done
under
15(a)(2)
and
if
you
are
right
that
ought
to
be
the
end
of
it,
should
it
not?
we
should
not
look
at
anything
that
is
what
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
15(a)(4)
explicitly
forbid
this
kind
of
condition
and
we
have
the
case
here
today
even
though
it
was
decided
under
15(a)(2)
and
we
could
–
do
you
suggest
15(a)(2)
can
be
read?
what
do
you
suppose
we
would
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
not
exactly
the
same
then
if
a
new
law
is
passed
which
it
has
been
and
it
says
15(a)(2)
will
no
longer
apply
at
all?
and
the
–
so
other
provision
applies.
either
other
provision
applies
or
it
does
not
but
in
any
event
15(a)(2)
does
not
apply
any
longer.
but
how
can
we
look
now
as
to
15(a)(2)?
unknown
speaker
15(a)(4)
but
something
does
more
than
that.
something
says
15(a)(2)will
no
longer
apply
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
is
the
future.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
we
are
talking
about
the
future
now.
i
mean,
about
today.
we
are
not
talking
about
yesterday.
we
are
talking
about
today.
unknown
speaker
but
it
may
enforce
then
whatever
the
power
was
than
they
have
the
power
now,
the
order
would
be
out
the
window,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
does
not
fit
–
should
we
not
confine
our
attention
to
15(a)(2)
then,
if
that
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
the
legislation
in
existence
at
the
time
the
order
was
entered
and
should
that
not
be
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
new
order?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
assume
that?
unknown
speaker
henceforth
the
commission
the
commission
shall
not
have
any
power
to
tell
railroads
what
they
shall
do
with
the
revenues
and
the
rate
increase.
but
the
henceforth
is
a
great
big
word,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
almost
implied
that
up
until
that
statute
there
the
commission
did
have
power
that
congress
had
recognized
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
more
than
that.
this
is
not
a
self
executing
order,
is
it?
does
it
not
require
continuing
supervision
by
the
commission
of
this
whole
revenue
matter?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
the
reports
might
show
some
use
of
that
revenues
that
was
arguably
deferred
it
maintenance
and
arguably
not
the
deferred
maintenance
and
there
are
going
to
be
some
problems
about
whether
that
use
was
correct
or
not?
so
inevitably
is
there
not
a
continuing
supervision
by
the
commission
of
the
district
for
these
funds.
unknown
speaker
whether
it
is
within
the
commissions
power
or
was
within
the
commissions
power?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
chessie?
unknown
speaker
and
so
with
respect
to
the
condition
--
with
respect
to
the
chessie
or
with
respect
to
all
railroads?
unknown
speaker
but
the
commission
although
it
was
been
staid
with
respect
to
the
cherssie
is
enforcing
it
with
respect
to
all
other
railroads.
unknown
speaker
this
have
happened
since
or
some
of
them
at
least
it
happens
since
the
district
court
staid
the
order.
