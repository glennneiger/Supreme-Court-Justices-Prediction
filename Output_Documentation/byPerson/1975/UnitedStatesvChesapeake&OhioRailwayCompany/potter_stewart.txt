justice
potter
stewart
does
your
argument
apply
some
kind
of
estoppel
argument?
the
real
question
is,
is
the
statutory
authority
of
the
commission
to
do,
what
it
did,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
not
the
only
real
question
here,
the
statutory
authority
of
the
commission
to
do
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
whether
it
was
justified
is
a
matter
of
rough
justice
or
is
really
not
the
question
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
only
issue
here?
