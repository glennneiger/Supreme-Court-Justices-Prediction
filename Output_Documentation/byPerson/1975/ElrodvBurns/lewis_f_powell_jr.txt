justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
type
of
jobs
do
these
1209
civil
service
people
hold?
you
mentioned
janitors
and
people
who
provided
various
services
and
how
is
a
line
drawn
between
the
civil
service
and
the
non-civil
service
employees?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
these
categories
as
prescribed
by
the
legislature?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
statewide
in
illinois?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
tucker?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
line
with
what
you’re
just
saying,
if
you
prevail
in
this
litigation
as
a
practical
matter,
won’t
you
set
the
stage
for
every
non-civil
service
government
employee,
local,
state
and
national
to
contest
any
discharge
on
the
ground
that
it
is
politically
motivated?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
whenever
they
are
discharged
by
someone
in
the
opposite
party
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
not
think
it
very
likely
that
the
individual
would
think
the
reason
was
political?
there
must
be
hundreds
of
thousands
of
non-civil
service
employees
at
government
levels
all
over
our
large
country.
i’m
just
wondering
about
the
extent
to
which
your
position
would
not
breed
a
vast
flood
of
litigation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i’m
interested
in
your
saying
they’re
forced
to
forgo
constitutional
rights.
all
of
the
respondents
and
everyone
of
these
people
you
are
talking
about
accepted
the
employment
under
the
system
you
are
now
attacking.
do
you
think
there’s
anything
at
all
to
the
argument
advanced
by
your
brother
that
they
waive
any
constitutional
right
they
may
have
had?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
knew
what
they
were
doing.
they
understood
the
system.
