mr.
thomas
a.
foran
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
alleged
violation
of
the
first
amendment
right
of
political
association
of
four
public
employees.
they
were
process
servers
and
court
attendants
in
the
office
of
the
sheriff
of
cook
county
whom
i
argue
in
behalf
of,
incident
to
discharges
or
threat
of
discharge
for
political
consideration
or
more
commonly
described
the
so
called
patronage
practice
of
requesting
political
sponsorship
for
either
appointment
to
certain
public
jobs
or
to
continue
in
employment
in
public
jobs.
in
this
particular
case,
the
plaintiffs
below,
who
are
the
respondents
here,
were
employees
of
the
sheriff’s
office
in
december
1970
when
an
incumbent
republican
was
replaced
by
the
democrat
elrod
who
was
elected
the
prior
month.
the
plaintiffs
were
not
in
job
categories
like
some
others
in
the
sheriff’s
office
which
were
protected
by
civil
service
or
other
nonpolitical
or
merit
system
of
job
category.
they
were
not
protected
in
anyway
by
contract
or
agreement
or
legislation
against
a
summary
discharge.
the
plaintiffs
stated
in
their
case
that
they
are
republicans
in
that
they
have
originally
obtained
their
jobs
in
the
sheriff’s
office
by
having
republican
sponsorship
by
republican
officials
in
order
to
be
employed
by
the
republican
sheriff.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir,
they
did.
they
alleged
that
they
were
discharged
because
they
were
republicans
and
could
not
or
would
not
obtain
democratic
sponsorship
to
continue
on
their
jobs.
now,
in
the
complaint
there
are
number
of
allegations
concerning
a
practice
of
discharging
non-civil
service
employees
in
cook
county
by
the
sheriff’s
office
on
the
assumption
that
a
sheriff
of
a
different
political
party
would
discharge
any
employee
who
didn’t
pledge
allegiance
to
the
party
of
the
new
sheriff,
who
didn’t
agree
to
work
for
the
party
and
candidates
of
the
party
of
the
new
sheriff,
would
not
contribute
a
portion
of
their
wages
to
the
party
of
the
new
sheriff
or
would
not
obtain
political
sponsorship
by
the
new
sheriff’s
party.
now,
neither
the
complaint
nor
the
affidavits
in
this
case
allege
that
these
four
respondents
were
required
or
that
they
were
even
told
that
they
might
be
required
to
meet
any
of
the
conditions
that
were
set
forth
as
a
practice
other
than
this
political
sponsorship
condition.
i
might
add
that
the
respondents
here
have
referred
the
court
to
a
stipulation
of
fact
by
the
sheriff
and
the
sheriff’s
office
in
a
companion
case,
the
shakman
case,
also
out
of
the
seventh
circuit.
we
do
not
object
to
that
statement
of
facts
of
the
operation
of
the
sheriff’s
office.
we
feel
that
it
does
fairly
state
what
the
factual
situation
is
in
the
sheriff’s
office.
the
district
court
below
denied
the
preliminary
injunction
and
dismissed
the
case
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
stipulation
of
the
sheriff’s
office
and
i
think
i
can
describe
it
in
summary
very
quickly.
there
are
3,000
employees
in
the
sheriff’s
office
in
cook
county.
about
500
of
them
fit
into
a
kind
of
large
category
that
includes
the
types
that
you
were
mentioning.
about
500
of
them
are
either
supervisory,
are
un-sponsored
by
any
political
person
or
are
holdovers
from
previous
administrations
almost
in
affect
career
employees,
might
well
have
been
sponsored
by
a
republican.
about
1300
of
the
employees
--
of
the
3000
employees
are
protected
by
a
legislatively
created
merit
system.
this
includes
the
sheriff’s
police
and
the
corrections
officers
who
run
the
county
jail
and
the
house
of
corrections
and
the
juvenile
facility
and
about
1200
are
in
this
--
of
the
3000
are
in
this
patronage
area
where
they
are
appointed
only
if
sponsored
by
a
political
figure
in
the
party
of
the
existing
sheriff.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
oh,
yes
sir
and
it
often
does
happen.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
that’s
correct
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir.
political
support
is
expected
with
respect
to
those
patronage
employees.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
no
sir,
not
specifically
nor
is
there
any
such
allegation
in
the
complaint.
the
requirement
is
that
one
supports
the
democratic
candidate
for
sheriff
for
his
reelection
at
least
and
in
all
likelihood
that
he
become
a
worker
for
the
democratic
party
in
his
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
that’s
a
hard
question
to
answer,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
court’s
decision
that
the
patronage
practice
of
sponsorship
would
presume
on
the
part
of
the
sponsoring
democrat
that
this
man
was
going
to
be
worker
generally
for
the
democratic
party.
in
the
lower
court,
the
district
court,
judge
power
dismissed
the
case
on
the
basis
of
alomar
versus
dwyer.
while
it
was
pending
on
appeal
the
seventh
circuit
came
to
down
with
the
illinois
state
employees
union
versus
lewis
where
a
republican
secretary
of
state
had
in
effect
done
the
same
thing
to
a
large
number
of
democrats
after
he
took
over
as
the
secretary
at
the
state’s
office.
i
did
mention
that
shakman
case
and
i
should
say
what
the
shakman
case
had
previously
held.
the
shakman
case
was
an
independent
who
was
running
for
constitutional
delegate
and
in
effect
a
kind
of
an
nonpartisan
election
and
in
the
shakman
case,
he
had
argued
that
because
the
major
political
parties
had
a
patronage
system
in
the
republic
employment
that
he
was,
his
voter
candidate
rights
to
equal
protection
in
his
election,
his
attempt
to
become
a
constitutional
delegate
had
been
interfered
with.
so
that
it
came
up
in
a
slightly
different
context
than
the
lewis
case
or
this
case
or
alomar
versus
dwyer,
but
nevertheless
was
related
in
the
instance
of
the
patronage
system
being
in
question.
so
that
the
core
issue
in
the
case
is
really
a
very
specific
one.
is
there
a
first
amendment
prohibition
against
an
elected
public
official
discharging
a
non-civil
service
employee
for
his
failure
to
obtain
political
sponsorship
by
the
party
that
the
elected
official
wishes
him
to.
perhaps
in
a
different
context
are
the
respondents'
rights
to
their
jobs
which
are
conditioned
on
their
political
affiliation,
the
equivalent
of
their
right
to
free
speech.
only
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
that
they
are.
the
second
circuit
the
said
no,
the
fourth
circuit
of
the
said
no
d.c.
circuit
has
said
no.
this
court
has
in
recent
years
unequivocally
held
that
the
right
of
political
association
is
not
absolute
and
is
subject
to
reasonable
restriction
or
limitation
in
the
public
interest,
in
the
letter
carrier’s
case,
in
the
buckley
versus
valeo,
this
court
has
so
held.
this
court
and
i
think
in
an
important
case
to
consider
because
it
is
the
companion
case
to
the
case
upon
which
the
respondents
rely,
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
that
non-tenured
teacher
who
was
fired
without
reason
being
given
to
him,
did
not
have
such
a
property
interest
in
his
job
that
it
would
generate
due
process
rights.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
had
ruled
that
he
did.
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
this
court
said
no.
he
was
a
non-tenured
teacher
and
he
had
alleged
that
his
first
amendment
rights
have
been
violated,
but
had
been
fired
for
no
reason
given.
now
--
so
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
he
had
no
such
property
and
interest
which
would
justify
protection
under
the
due
process
clause
or
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
argument
then
must
be
by
the
respondents
that
this
non-tenured,
these
non-tenured
employees
who
had
no
contract,
no
agreement,
who
had
got
their
job
well-knowing
since
they
had
already
receive
their
jobs
politically
sponsored,
that
it
was
the
time
of
--
type
of
job
that
needed
political
sponsorship,
whether
those
people
had
such
a
right
in
their
job
that
their
political
association
was
like
free
speech
and
that
their
interest
as
individuals
in
free
speech
overrode
any
governmental
interest
that
might
exist
in
a
partisan
political
public
service,
a
governmental
interest
in
that
which
could
condition
or
restrict
their
right
to
political
association.
it
seems
to
me
that
while
the
respondents
do
here
argue
that
there
is
no
legitimate
governmental
interest
in
or
at
least
no
compelling
governmental
interest,
in
a
partisan
political
public
service
that
in
that
area
which
has
not
been
articulated,
we
must
strongly
disagree
with
that
position.
their
position
is
based
on
this
type
of
argument.
since
some
courts,
including
this
court,
have
agreed
that
non-partisanship
in
public
service
and
public
office
is
under
some
circumstances,
some
legislative
acts,
the
hatch
act
is
the
most
obvious,
campaign
financing,
that
if
in
certain
areas
of
government
that
it
is
good
to
have
a
nonpartisan
tenured
security-oriented
employee
that
therefore
necessarily
political
public
service
is
bad.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
exactly,
mr.
justice,
exactly.
and
in
this
case,
at
a
different
level,
we
have
the
same
situation
here.
the
illinois
state
legislature
and
the
county
board
of
cook
county
have
both
legislatively
acted
to
say
with
respect
to
certain
officers,
the
police
and
the
corrections
officers
in
the
sheriff’s
office,
they
are
merit.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
in
effect,
yes.
i
think
and
i
replied
briefly
commented
on
the
criticism
by
the
respondents
of
chief
justice
bell’s
factual
analysis
of
that
and
suggested
that
perhaps
in
exchange,
is
he
who
has
not
sinned
should
cast
the
first
stone
which
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
may
be
wrong.
they
did
not
do
that
here.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
the
difference
is
this.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir,
and
the
difference
is
further
than
this.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
a
state
officer
who
is
an
elected
public
official
under
a
--
in
a
political
public
office
can
with
particular
employees
who
have
not
been
made
a
part
of
a
nonpolitical
public
service.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir,
could
not.
they
could
do
it.
they
can
only
say,
you
can
appoint.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
a
democrat,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
or
republican
governor.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
oh
no,
no
sir.
what
he
can
say
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
any
public
official
with
respect
to
public
jobs
that
are
not
designated
as
nonpolitical
public
jobs.
see
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
let
me
give
this
as
the
state
--
as
the
state
interest.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
i
think
it
is.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
i
think
it
is
essential
to
show
that
there
is
some
state
interest
in
partisanship.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
i
think
they
could
say
that,
yes.
they
could
say,
“you’re
just
fired,”
but
they
didn’t--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
they
said
you
we
fired
you
because
you
won’t
switch
over
and
help
us
politically.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
party.
it
is
this
mr.
justice
white.
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
as
the
distinguished
from
the
european
public
service,
the
concept
of
political
public
service
is
crucial
to
the
growth
of
the
government
for
a
very
--
for
many
reasons.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
to
the
growth
and
good
operation,
the
efficient
operation
of
the
government.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
no
to
the
operation
of
the
government.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
because
of
the
very
human
instinct.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
much
more
than
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
an
elected
public
official
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
not
just
the
political
argument,
but
the
political
argument
--
well,
the
political
argument
is
also
a
good
one
to
this
extent
that
the
sheriff
who
has
been
elected
by
the
people
to
exercise
his
management
discretion,
if
he
is
to
exercise
his
management
discretion
consisting
with
his
commitment
to
the
people
who
elected
him,
the
people
who
work
for
him
should
be
loyal
to
him
and
he
should
have
faith
that
they
are
loyal
to
him
and
he
should
have
faith
that
they
are
intending
to
encourage
his
reelection
as
the
political
figure
that
he
is
in
that
operation
of
the
government.
that’s
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
there
is
by
the
way
some
comment
in
the
lewis
case
about
policy
making,
non-policy
making,
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
but
then
by
the
way
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
does
include
a
fallacy.
government
at
the
local
level
is
not
run
from
the
quarterdeck;
it
is
run
from
the
engine
room.
what
government
gives
in
the
local
area
a
service
to
the
people,
it
services
sewers,
it
services
court
operations,
it
services
summons,
it
takes
care
of
buildings,
it
runs
transportation
systems,
it
collects
the
garbage,
it
keeps
the
water
pure.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
we
do
have
that
constitutional
problem,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
they
could
with
many
officers,
they
could
eliminate.
the
legislature
could
eliminate.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
they
haven’t.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir,
the
freelancers
by
the
way
include
the
policy
makers
mr.
justice
white
and
freelancers
is
a
good
way
to
describe
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
that’s
the
way
it’s
always
run
and
by
the
way
not
just
in
chicago,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
it
has
happened
throughout
the
country’s
history,
throughout
the
country’s
history.
now,
ordinarily
when
we
talk
about
policy
making,
non-policy
making
mr.
justice
white
that’s
where
we
get
into
the
quarterdeck
concept
because
we
talk
about
the
perquisite
of
office
of
the
elected
executive.
the
president
of
the
united
states,
i
think
jefferson,
for
instance
when
he
came
into
office
one
time
said,
“well,
i
think
i’ll
wait
for
the
normal
attrition
in
jobs,”
and
then
he
said
“few
died,
but
nobody”
–-
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
when
we
say
this
mr.
justice
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
i
think
it
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
i
do
believe
it’s
essential
for
the
efficiency
of
government.
and
it’s
simply
this,
look
at
the
plethora
of
cases
that
are
coming
up
in
all
of
the
federal
district
courts,
by
the
way
in
line
with
your
question,
mr.
justice
marshall,
of
what
happens
in
a
civil
service
system
that
shuts
out
the
disadvantaged,
that
shuts
out
minorities,
that
shuts
out
the
aged,
that
shuts
out
the
infirm,
because
of
the
requirements
for
testing.
all
over
the
country
were
running
in
to
that
problem
with
the
fact
that
we
don’t
have
proper
proportions
of
our
society,
proper
geographic
distribution
within
our
voting
districts
because
of
civil
service
regulations.
the
patronage
system,
mr.
justice
white,
is
the
way
that
the
minority
people
in
this
country
got
into
the
saying
that
this
record
--
pardon?
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
oh,
well
on
this
record.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice
blackmun,
not
on
this
record
i
cannot,
but
i
can
say
that
in
the
civil
service
area
of
public
employment,
there
are
cases
all
over
this
country
that
are
indicating
that
not
sufficient
numbers
of
minorities
are
able
to
get
into
public
service
under
the
civil
service
system.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
not
under
this
record
here
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
the
civil
service
in
the
sheriff’s
office
are
the
county
sheriff’s
police,
and
the
corrections
officers
who
take
care
of
the
county
jail
and
the
house
of
corrections
and
the
juvenile
court
facility
which
are
all
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sheriff.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir,
as
a
merit
system
of
employment.
the
other
--
all
other
categories
which
include
the
supervisory
level
of
the
police,
the
warden
of
the
county
jail,
the
majors
supervisors
of
divisions
and
many
of
the
court
attendant’s
process
servers,
at
least
some.
for
instance,
in
the
court
attendants
all
of
the
judges
select
their
own,
the
sheriffs.
there’s
no
political
patronage
involved
in
that.
although
there
is
a
judicial
patronage
involved
in
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
pardon?
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
oh
yes.
as
a
matter
fact,
in
the
shakman
case,
there
are
comments
in
the
brief
about
the
consent
judgment.
there
are
103
defendants
in
the
shakman
case,
103
republican
committeemen,
defendants
who
have
not
consented
to
the
--
in
the
shakman
case.
elrod
is
not
consented
in
the
shakman
case.
the
chicago
park
district
is
not
consented
in
the
shakman
case.
recently,
the
new
governor
of
illinois
--
recently
the
new
governor
of
illinois
argued
that
the
consent
decree
of
the
predecessor
governor
did
not
apply
to
him.
by
the
way,
he’s
no
--
he
doesn’t
look
like
he’s
going
to
be
the
new
governor
for
long
because
he
was
recently
--
he
didn’t
win
a
nomination.
but
the
partisan
political
service,
mr.
justice
white,
just
to
get
back
to
that
point,
it’s
consensus
what
it
is,
is
the
necessity
of
consensus
to
operate
any
conceivable
operation,
the
necessity
of
loyalty.
by
the
way,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stevens
used
a
good
phrase
of
it.
he
called
the
necessity
of
effective
supervision
of
employees,
for
an
employee
to
know
that
he
is
subject
to
your
discipline
if
he
doesn’t
do
what
you
want
him
to
do,
that
he
must
me
loyal
to
you
in
your
endeavor
to
convince
the
people
that
your
representations
to
them
that
you
could
do
this
job
or
based
on
your
political
commitment.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
that’s
correct
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
interest
that
i’m
talking
of.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
i
do
mr.
justice
white,
because
i
say
this
when
a
man
is
elected
by
the
people
to
operate
a
service
government,
the
people
elect
him
to
exercise
his
discretion
as
he
sees
fit.
one
of
the
prerequisites
of
that
discretion
is
his
right
to
appoint
and
one
of
the
things
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
i
think
because
some
particular
jobs
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
partly,
mr.
justice
white,
there
are
certain
types
of
jobs
that
simply
should
not
be
subject
to
political
control.
historically,
firemen
and
policemen
are
highly
tended
to
become
civil
service
under
the
legislatures.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir,
since
1890.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
well,
that’s
right
but
the
legislature
took
it
away
from
them.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
and
they
took
the
fbi
away
and
they
took
the
cia
away
and
--
but
the
legislature
did
that,
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
do
that
and
the
legislature
has
the
right
not
to
do
it
and
in
this
case
they
didn’t
do
it.
and
what
the
respondents
are
asking
here
to
do,
are
asking
this
court
to
do
it
for
the
legislature.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
i
think,
the
necessity
of
generating
consensus,
mr.
justice
white
is
terribly
important,
the
opportunity
for
a
political
official
to
have
a
chance
to
be
reelected,
to
continue
his
progress.
i
think
that
is
terribly
important
and
that
is
a
mixture
of
the
government
and
the
political
process.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
i’d
say
that’s
a
fair
analogy,
mr.
justice
burger.
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
no
sir,
not
that
i
know
of.
they
all
by
the
way
and
by
the
president’s
power
to
appoint
is
used
there
to
generate
consensus
for
his
program.
i’d
like
to
save
the
couple
of
minutes
if
i
could
--
mr.
thomas
a.
foran
i
just
ran
out
of
out
it
--
