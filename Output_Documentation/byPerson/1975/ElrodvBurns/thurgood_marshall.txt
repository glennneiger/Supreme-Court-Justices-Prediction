justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
legislature
of
illinois
passed
a
statute
which
said
only
democrats
maybe
employed
in
the
sheriff’s
office.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
legislation
didn’t
work.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
a
state
officer
can
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
legislature
couldn’t
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
the
governor
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
democratic
governor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
issue
a
proclamation
saying
that
only
democrats
can
work?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
county
sheriff
can,
who
else
can
besides
the
county
sheriff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
helps
out
the
party,
that’s
why.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
enough
to
protect
your
interest
if
you
drew
a
line,
if
he
divided
the
employees
where
it
was
important
that
obviously
that
they
followed
his
lead
and
others
that
