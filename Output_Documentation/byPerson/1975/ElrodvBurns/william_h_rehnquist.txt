justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
stated
that
in
their
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
tell
from
the
shakman
case,
mr.
foran,
whether
a
republican
might
be
employed
in
the
tradition
of
the
sheriff’s
office
by
a
democratic
sheriff
if
he
obtained
a
democratic
sponsor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
is
it
theoretically
possible
at
least
for
a
republican
employee
within
this
1200,
when
a
democratic
sheriff
comes
to
power,
if
he
could
get
a
sponsorship
from
a
democrat,
he
could
be
retained?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there
a
change
of
registration
required?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
--
i
realize
there
comes
point
at
which
probably
a
stipulation
doesn’t
exhaust
--
doesn’t
cover.
is
it
also
required
that
he
support
that
democratic
candidate
for
senator
and
for
governor
as
well
as
the
democratic
candidate
for
sheriff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
would
have
thought
all
this
court
said
in
the
hatch
act
cases
was
that
congress
thought
it
was
desirable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
implication
they
have
said
with
the
respect
to
the
rest
of
them
“he'd
who
lived
by
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you’re
going
to
have
a
political
organization
in
the
city
of
the
size
of
chicago
someone
who
is
elected
sheriff
has
to
have
some
jobs
to
give
out
when
he
gets
in,
doesn’t
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
lots
of
other
places.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there’s
a
more
practical
reasons
than
that
too,
aren’t
there,
mr.
foran?
who’s
going
to
circulate
the
sheriff’s
nominating
petitions?
i
don’t
know
if
you
have
petition
requirement
in
illinois,
we
did
in
arizona
and
every
elected
political
officer
had
to
have
a
couple
political
people
on
his
staff
not
to
make
policy,
but
circulate
his
nominating
petitions
and
to
do
things
like
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it’s
not
anything
new
and
the
first
amendment
has
been
with
us
since
1791,
why
did
andrew
jackson
feel
free
to
say,
“to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
wait
a
minute.
you
agree
that
the
thing
is
a
balancing
test.
you
would
agree
that
the
governor’s
principal
assistant
in
springfield,
his
special
counsel
certainly
has
to
give
up
his
constitutional
rights
if
he’s
a
republican
and
wants
to
be
counsel
to
the
democratic
government
and
the
governor
tells
him
that’s
fine
but
you
register
as
a
democrat,
he’s
got
to
do
that
to
get
that
job,
doesn’t
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
get
a
policy-making
job
than
under
your
analysis,
if
it’s
a
republican
administration
and
you
really
--
and
you’re
a
democrat
you
may
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
your
constitutional
rights.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
talking
about
policy
making.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
buckley
also,
though
the
court
in
sustaining
the
public
financing
provisions
indicated
that
congress
could
go
a
pretty
far
distance
in
funding
the
two
major
parties
differently
than
minority
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
also
agreed
that
these
plaintiffs
obtain
their
job
through
the
operation
of
that
same
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
your
only
exception
for
policy
making
--
the
reason
i
want
to
give
you
an
example,
arizona
has
a
corporation
commission
consisting
of
three
members
who
are
elected
and
who
were
highly
political
and
they
have
an
executive
secretary
who
has
no
policy-making
responsibilities
whatever.
he
simply
hangs
around,
so
to
speak,
and
will
inscribe
the
commission’s
orders
on
the
docket
sheets.
i
would
say
under
your
definition,
he
is
not
a
policy-maker
at
all.
can
they
not,
if
the
party
control,
or
corporation
commission
changes,
can
a
new
majority
not
replace
him
under
your
theory?
