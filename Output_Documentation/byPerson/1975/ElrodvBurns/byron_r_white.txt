justice
byron
r.
white
what
state
is
the
writ
in
that
--
in
having
that
to
be
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
--
you
seem
to
say
that
it’s
essential
to
find
the
state
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
think
--
you
don’t
think
the
sheriff’s
office
or
illinois
is
permitted
to
just
say
to
these
people
“you’re
just
fired.
we
don’t
need
to
give
any
reason
at
all.”
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
we
are
firing
you
because
you
belong
to
the
wrong
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
to
do
that
if
you’re
going
to
say
that
in
they
must
find
some
substantial
state
interest
of
pretty
strong
one.
now,
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
growth
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it’s
essential
into
the
elective
process
or
essential
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
operation
of
the
government.
why
is
it
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently,
the
legislature
--
the
legislature
thinks
there
is
some
way
of
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i’m
still
waiting
for
you
tell
me
state
history
is
in
having
the
elevator
operator,
be
republican
rather
than
a
democrat,
or
a
democrat
rather
than
a
republican?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
accept
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
statement,
this
is
just
essential
to
have
the
two-party
system
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
certainly
isn’t
essential
for
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
we
going
to
embrace
this
view
that
it’s
essential
to
make
the
elective
process
work?
you
just
don’t
seem
to
want
to
do.
you
want
to
put
it
on
the
operation
of
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
so
important,
i’m
surprised
the
illinois
legislature
has
removed
from
this
category
these
very
important
blocks
of
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
would
be
the
very
ones
that
you
would
like
to
know
are
supporting
you
“tooth
and
toenail?”
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
--
if
you’d
like
to
have
the
unqualified
support
of
some
people
in
your
office
you’d
like
to
have
it
from
the
policeman
or
other
serving
the
people
and
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
the
reason
that
you
give,
it
seems
to
me
is
it
considerably
illuminated
by
what
the
legislature
of
illinois
has
done.
i
mean,
it
wouldn’t
if
you
would
just
frankly
say
that
what
the
party
said,
the
elective
process
has
to
work
and
the
party
system
to
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
in
the
interest
in
what
overrides
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
arrive
at
it?
how
do
you
arrive
at
the
fact
that
policy
maker
has
to
get
--
that
it’s
alright
to
fire
the
policy-making
office
holder?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
say
in
that
kind
of
job
whatever
the
gentleman’s
first
amendment
interests
are,
they
are
not
sufficient
to
keep
him
in
the
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
yes
or
no
--
isn’t
there
a
yes
or
no
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn’t
keep
his
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
this
say
that
he’s
fired
because
of
his
political
beliefs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
he’s
fired
because
he
doesn’t
--
very
likely
he
doesn’t
agree
with
his
new
boss?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
more
do
you
want
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
now
would
you
--
i
take
it
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
kind
of
argument
if
there
were
a
state
law,
state
statute
or
state
constitutional
provision
which
said
we
are
not
now
enacting
any
rule
that
only
democrats
or
republicans
may
work
for
the
state
government.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
whatever
party
wins
the
election
must
staff
the
state
government.
from
bottom
to
top
and
whoever
wins
the
elections
runs
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
fact
that
--
although
the
fact
that
a
republican
gets
selected
governor
automatically
takes
care
of
the
democrat
and
he
--
the
republican
moves
in
and
runs
the
state
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
whoever
wins
the
election
runs
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what’s
wrong
--
what’s
the
difference
between
the
legislature
saying,
“well,
we’re
going
to
replace
this
democratic
governor
because
the
republican
won
the
election”
and
saying
that,
“well,
he
can
only
replace
the
elevator
operator”?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
state
law
says
if
you
win
the
election
you
also
replace
the
elevator
operator?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it’s
not
that
different
from
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
a
neutral
law.
this
is
a
neutral
access,
whoever
wins
the
elections
can
work
for
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
republican
or
democrat.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
socialist
or
communist,
whoever
wins.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
put
it
the
other
way
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whoever
wins
the
election,
staffs
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
500?

byron
