mr.
john
c.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i’m
not
certain
i
can
answer
that
directly.
i
suppose
you
would
start
back
with
the
original
federal
civil
service
laws
back
in
the
period
following
the
assassination
of
garfield
when
civil
service
reform
began
in
the
1800.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yeah,
1880s,
yes
sir.
however,
i
think
on
the
historical
aspect
of
this
case
as
we’ve
indicated
in
the
brief,
it
is
not
correct
that
the
patronage
or
spoil
system
has
always
been
a
part
of
our
government
since
constitutional
times
for
whatever
relevancy
that
has
to
the
fundamental
constitutional
issues
in
this
case.
i
think
really
it
has
very
little
because
we
are
dealing
with
rights
which
this
court
has
just
declared
and
it’s
not
that
it’s
anything
new
but
certainly
just
recently
again
declared
are
at
the
very
core
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
per
curiam
decision
in
buckley.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
because
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
the
court
--
this
court
for
many
years
up
until
the
late
40s
or
early
50s
engaged
in
what
was
considered
to
be
a
right
privileged
distinction
with
respect
to
public
employment
and
they
said
the
court
in
substance,
said
well
there
is
no
right
to
public
employment
and
therefore
there
are
no
benefits
that
come
with
it.
it’s
purely
a
matter
of
discretion
and
you
can
even
require
someone
to
give
up
their
constitutional
rights.
however,
once
you
accept
the
proposition
which
mr.
justice
stewart,
again
not
a
new
proposition
but
i
supposed
culminating
in
mr.
justice
stewart’s
decision
in
the
sindermann
case,
that
there
are
certain
things
which
you
cannot
require
as
public
employees.
there
are
certain
things
for
which
you
cannot
take
away
the
benefit,
one
of
which
is
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes
sir.
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
you
have
to
register
as
a
democrat,
i
would
say
this
that
i
have
no
objection
to
the
policy/non-policy
distinction
which
the
court
below
in
this
case
and
mr.
justice
stevens
in
the
lewis
case
devised,
i
have
no
objection
to
that.
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
same
thing
as
a
balancing
test
with
respect
to
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
however,
that’s
a
different
kind
of
balance,
that’s
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
now
just
a
moment,
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
policy-making
and
the
non-policy
making.
i
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
you’re
now
on
policy
making.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
don’t
think
that
you’re
--
when
you’re
on
policy
making
if
you
want
to
say
you
have
to
give
up
certain
rights,
i
suppose
that’s
right,
you
do.
the
chances
are
you’ve
already
made
a
determination
with
respect
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
oh,
i’m
not
saying
--
i’m
not
saying
that
the
interest
--
there’s
a
governmental
interest
that
overrides
the
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
you
get
there
by
virtue
of
another
distinction
that
justice
stevens
drew
in
lewis
which
is
there
are
certain
kinds
of
jobs
and
i
think
this
is
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
the
jobs
that
the
chief
justice
was
talking
about,
congressional
administrative
aides.
there
are
certain
kinds
of
jobs
in
which
a
personal
loyalty
and
an
agreement
with
the
governmental
philosophy
of
the
officeholder
is
essential.
and
i
don’t
think
you
find
--
you
know,
that’s
not
what
the
patronage
system
is
about.
we’re
not
talking
about
those
jobs
and
we’re
talking
about
the
patronage
system.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
suppose
there
is
and
the
answer
would
have
to
be
no,
but
i
don’t
think
that’s
the
way
it
works
out
as
a
practical
matter
because
first
amendment
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no
sir,
he
does
not
keep
his
job,
but
at
that
point
in
time,
his,
as
a
policy-maker,
the
person
or
public
office
holder
who
brought
him
in
there
is
leaving.
his
whole
philosophy
so
to
speak
insofar
as
it
relates
to
that
job
is
leaving,
i
don’t
think
at
that
point
you
can
really
say
that
the
congressional
aide
or
the
--
to
take
it
to
the
sublime,
the
secretary
of
state
is
fired
because
he
is
a
republican
or
because
he
is
a
democrat,
he
simply
leaves
with
the
group
that
was
in
office,
the
group
of
people
who
ran
that
public
office.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
you
can,
do
you
say?
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
perhaps
so,
perhaps
so.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
he
is
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
more
realistically,
he
is
fired,
mr.
justice
white
because
he
is
not
really
fired,
he
leaves
with
the
administration
and
it’s
more
of
a
personal
than
a
political
matter.
many
times
someone
perhaps
of
a
different
political
persuasion
comes
in.
but
the
distinction
that
i
think
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
we
are
not
talking
about
those
kinds
of
personnel.
we
are
talking
--
we’re
not
talking
about
congressional
aides.
we’re
talking
about
process
servers,
bailiffs,
janitors,
window
washers,
street
cleaners
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
not
in
sindermann,
your
honor.
in
roth
there
was
and
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no
sir,
i--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
when
you
talk
about
due
process
rights
it
does.
we
are
not
talking
about
due
process
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
first
amendment
rights
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
in
sindermann
made
that
distinction
very
clear
when
he
said
and
when
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
even
where
there
is
no
expectation
of
continued
employment,
and
therefore,
discharge
discretionary,
there
are
some
reasons
for
which
you
cannot
discharge
people
and
the
most
basic
of
them
is
the
exercise
of
fundamental
first
amendment
rights.
and
the
right,
the
basic
right
to
freedom
of
political
association
as
this
court
has
held
in
kusper
versus
pontikes,
in
buckley
more
recently,
every
member
of
the
court
agreed
that
the
right
of
freedom
of
political
association
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
that’s
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
that
the,
what
the
court
as
i
understand
it,
comes
to
as
far
as
that
part
of
buckley
is
concerned
is
simply
well,
we
can
find
nothing
on
this
record
to
suggest
that
there
is
anything
discriminatory
about
this
set
up.
your
honors
have
always
made
it
clear
in
the
letter
carriers
case,
in
united
public
workers
and
i
think
in
buckley
that
where
fundamental
rights
such
as
political
association
are
involved,
a
statutory
scheme
that
is
going
to
infringe
on
this
and
of
course
here
we
don’t
have
a
statutory
scheme,
we
got
an
ad
hoc
determination
of
the
sheriff
of
cook
county,
but
any
public
official
or
legislative
or
congressional
enactment
that
would
infringe
on
those
rights
must
be
extremely
narrowly
drawn
and
must
be
totally
neutral
and
nondiscriminatory.
this
is
--
pardon
me?
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no,
i
don’t
believe
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that
is
a
statutory
scheme,
but
in
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
they
picked
out
two
departments,
the
police
and
the
corrections
department.
but
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
answered
that
question
and
in
the
first
place,
the
legislature
has
not
acted.
the
legislature
has
simply
not
acted
with
respect
to
these
and
many,
many
other
employees.
it’s
not
that
they
devised
a
scheme
with
respect
to
how
they
could
or
could
not
be
discharged
or
said
specifically
that
no
republican
may
remain
in
office
or
no
person
shall
be
in
office
or
be
a
public
employee
for
an
office
holder
of
an
opposite
party.
but
as
mr.
justice
marshall
says
and
as
this
court
has
said,
since
1949
every
member
--
not
every
member
of
this
court,
but
i
think
most
recently
mr.
justice
white
in
his
decision
in
arnett
has
continuously
said
the
same
thing.
congress,
the
legislature
may
not
be
--
the
state
may
not
enact
a
law,
the
substance
of
which
is
that
no
republican,
jew
or
negro
may
be
employed
in
public
office
or
is
a
public
employee.
and
to
suggest
that
the
legislature
has
acted
by
not
acting
here
seems
to
me
to
be
irrelevant
to
the
controversy
because
if
the
legislature
had
specifically
enacted
something
to
approve
this
or
the
congress
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i
understand
the
reference
that
you
make
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
go
back
to
what
i
said.
if
the
legislature
had
enacted
a
provision
specifically
doing
what
sheriff
elrod
does
and
i
think
it’s
important
to
look
at
what
the
facts
here
and
they’re
undisputed
and
mr.
foran
very
frankly
admits.
the
requirement
is
that
in
order
to
obtain
and
or
maintain
your
job
as
a
janitor
or
a
process
server
in
the
sheriff’s
office,
you
have
to
agree,
a)
to
switch
your
party
affiliation
or
if
you’re
unaffiliated
to
affiliate
with
the
democratic
party
of
cook
county,
not
just
the
democratic
party
because
there
are
other
democrats
in
cook
county
besides
the
regular
organization.
you
have
to
agree
to
affiliate
with
that
organization
and
to
work
for
and
support
it’s
entire
slate
of
candidates
not
only
for
sheriff,
but
down
the
line.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
it
is
not
agreed
on
the
record
that
they
obtained
them
on
the
basis
of
the
system
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
record
is
silent.
it
is
of
record
that
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
republican
sponsorship
at
the
time
that
they
came
into
their
jobs.
it’s
not
clear
in
the
record
as
to
what
that
entailed
whether
the
same
kind
of
affirmative
support
of
a
particular
county
party
ticket
was
required.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes
sir.
i
would
be
here
making
the
same
argument
because
that
would
be
in
substance
to
the
statute
saying
that
no
republican,
if
a
democrat
wins
the
office
shall
be
a
public
employee
during
that
term
of
office.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
that
the
governor
has
been
elected
by
the
people
of
the
state
to
hold
the
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
but
the
state
law,
i
understand
you,
this
is
a
hypothetical
state
law,
mr.
justice
white
that
you’re
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
alright,
and
i
suggest
that
what
this
court
has
said
and
every
member
of
this
court
over
the
years
since
1949
or
every
successive
court
including
yourself,
mr.
justice
white
in
arnett
is
that
that
kind
of
a
law
either
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
it
is
not
a
new
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
oh,
i
misunderstood--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
you
propose
is
one
that
says
that
when
a
republican
is
elected
governor,
no
democrat
shall
be
permitted
to
serve
in
the
public
service,
is
that
it?
mr.
john
c.
tucker
or
the
other
way
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
alright,
think
that
the
--
where
the
--
that
mr.
justice
stewart’s
opinion
in
sindermann
and
all
of
the
opinions
going
back
to
wyman
and
that
precede
that
make
it
clear
that
that
cannot
be
the
law
because
it
involves
giving
up
and
requiring
people
as
the
price
of
public
employment
to
give
up
their
fundamental
first
amendment
rights.
and
i
think
that
if
sindermann
means
anything
and
if
wyman
mean
anything
and
all
of
the
cases
that
have
said
that
you
cannot
require
people
to
give
up
their
fundamental
rights
as
the
price
of
public
employment,
if
those
cases
mean
anything,
they
mean
that
you
cannot
come
into
office
or
while
in
the
office
make
a
requirement
of
public
employment
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
except
for
500,
you
mean
the
policy-making?
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i
think
that
that’s
a
distinction
that
has
been
drawn
and
worked
in
many
other
areas,
mr.
justice
white
and
one
that
is
clearly
appropriate
in
light
of
the
function
of
government
and
the
way
in
which
the
government
operates
in
an
elective
process.
but
when
you’re
talking
about
non-policy
making
employees,
i
think
that
you
have
to
follow
the
line
of
cases
and
afford
these
people
their
fundamental
constitutional
rights
and
if
when
you
say
that
they
will
be
deprived
of
those
rights
or
that
they
can
be
discharged
or
kept
from
public
service
by
virtue
of
their
exercise
of
their
fundamental
freedom
of
political
expression,
then
you
are
doing
by
indirection
that
which
you
could
not
do
directly
which
is
exactly
what
mr.
justice
stewart
expresses.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think
they
could
because
i
think
that
as
mr.
justice
stevens
in
the
lewis
opinion
indicated
there
are
certain
kinds
of
positions,
which
are
of
such
a
personal
nature.
for
example,
it
maybe
that
--
let’s
just
take
the
sheriff’s
personal
chauffeur
who
maybe
a
person
who
is
certainly
isn’t
making
any
policy.
when
a
new
sheriff
comes
in,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
he
has
to
keep
the
old
sheriff’s
personal
chauffeur
or
bodyguard.
it
maybe
that
he
has
to
use
that
person
or
move
that
person
into
another
capacity
if
he
is
qualified
for
it
in
the
sheriff’s
office
rather
than
just
firing
him
because
he
is
a
republican
or
a
democrat
but
he’s
certainly
entitled
to
have
this
own
man
driving
his
car
and
i
think
the
example
you
give
me
is
the
same
kind
of
thing.
furthermore,
i
think
it’s
important
that
everybody
understand
that
we’re
not
asking
this
court
to
create
and
the
seventh
circuit
again
made
it
very
clear
that
we’re
not
creating
a
super
civil
service.
the
question
--
the
only
thing
that
is
being
done
here
is
to
say
not
that
these
people
have
tenure,
not
that
they
can’t
be
fired
for
any
reason
whatsoever,
but
simply
that
if
the
sole
reason
they
are
discharged
is
because
of
their
exercise
of
their
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
political
expression
and
if
they
can
bear
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
then
they
have
a
claim
for
violation
under
1983
for
violation
of
their
fundamental
first
amendment
right.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
don’t
believe
so
or
perhaps
i
should
put
it
on
another
way,
mr.
justice
powell.
it
is
clear
that
the
rule
for
which
the
seventh
circuit
adapted
does
create
or
recognize
that
there
are
certain
things
in
this
instance
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights
for
which
the
people
may
not
be
discharged,
therefore,
persons
who
are
discharged,
i
suppose
could
allege
that
they
were
discharge
for
political
reasons.
however
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
yes.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
understand
that
question
and
my
answer
to
it
is
three
things,
three-fold.
number
one,
this
is
a
vastly
different
thing
than
a
civil
service
system
in
which
there
is
a
presumption
where
that
the
office
holder
has
to
show
a
cause
for
firing
and
go
through
a
whole
panoply
of
due
process
rights
and
so
forth.
the
burden
in
these
cases
would
be
on
the
discharged
employee.
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
discharged
employee
to
show
that
the
sole
reason
for
his
discharge
was
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
that
the
very
placement
of
that
burden
on
the
employee
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
in
my
judgment
makes
it
clear
that
there
would
be
very
little
problem
in
terms
of
enforcement.
now,
there
is
some
history
in
this
regard.
in
the
seventh
circuit
we
have
history
based
on
two
things.
number
one,
we
have
the
so-called
shakman
consent
decree,
and
number
two,
we
have
had
the
decision
in
shakman
and
in
the
lewis
opinion
for
four
or
five
years.
there
have
been
a
grand
total
of
i
believe
four
enforcement
proceedings
under
the
shakman
decree,
in
that
entire
period
of
time
with
many,
many
thousands
of
workers
covered.
there
have
been
i
think
five
or
six
cases
filed
under
the
general
provisions
of
shakman
and
lewis
and
in
that
whole
period
of
time
in
the
entire
seventh
circuit
and
i
think
in
each
instance,
the
only
people
who
filed
those
suits
in
one
instance
was
the
public
employees
union
in
lewis,
which
resulted
in
the
lewis
decision,
another
one
is
this
case,
which
again
is
filed
as
a
class
action
in
the
situation
where
the
violation
is
admitted
and
flagrant
on
the
record
and
no
dispute
about
that.
and
the
others
were
three
or
four
cases
in
which
after
governor
walker
became
governor,
people
in
much
higher
levels
brought
actions,
which
in
each
instance
resulted
in
the
determination
that
they
were
policy-making
employees
and
therefore
not
covered.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
it
in
those
terms
you
can
see
that
any
concern
or
any
interim
argument
based
on
the
idea
that
there
would
be
a
flood
of
litigation
arising
from
this
kind
of
a
determination
is
simply
not
justified.
at
the
same
time,
i
cannot
answer
your
question
without
also
saying
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
protection
of
fundamental
first
amendment
rights.
there
is
no
one
else
to
protect
these
rights.
there
is
no
procedure
in
illinois,
administrative
state
law
or
otherwise.
if
the
sheriff
of
cook
county
or
other
officeholders
throughout
this
country
utilized
the
public
payroll
in
their
election
to
public
office
and
the
tax
money
that
the
tax
payers
provide
them
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
an
army
of
partisan
workers,
while
in
doing
so
and
in
order
to
do
so
requiring
those
persons
to
forfeit
their
fundamental
rights
under
the
constitution,
it’s
--
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no,
i
don’t
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
assume
those
things
to
be
true.
it’s
not
necessarily
clear
on
the
record,
but
assume
those
things
to
be
true.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
and
i
think
that
in
their
reply
brief
they’ve
basically
admitted
and
agreed
that
there
can
be
if
there
are
fundamental
constitutional
rights
involved
here,
there
can
be
no
waiver
applied
in
this
situation
by
any
construction
of
the
law
of
waiver
when
you’re
dealing
with
first
amendment
rights.
but
forgetting
about
looking
at
it
from
the
legal
standpoint
and
analyzing
whether
there
could
be
a
waiver
of
constitutional
rights
here,
i
don’t
think
that
the,
and
you
can
phrase
this
in
terms
of
the
“live
by
the
sword,
die
by
the
sword”
analogy
or
any
other
kind
of
phrase
that
expresses
that
same
idea.
i
don’t
think
that
that
can
be
applied
to
the
situation.
in
the
first
place,
the
people
that
are
involved
here,
non-policy
making
employees
of
public
agencies
are
the
people
who
are
least
in
the
position
to
exercise
the
election
of
going
elsewhere
in
order
to
preserve
their
constitutional
rights.
they’re
people
who
applied
for
and
need
jobs.
they
are
compelled
in
order
to
receive
those
jobs,
to
get
those
jobs,
to
agree
to
forgo
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
with
respect
to
the
particular
job
as
chauffeur/bodyguard,
yes,
because
of
a
personal
loyalty
or
personal
connection
that
maybe
required
there.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
i
think,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
have
to
be
practical
about
it
in
any
kind
of
a
situation
of
this
sort
and
what
i’m
saying
is
that
the
personal
chauffeur
for
the
sheriff
may
have
to
be
your
--
the
sheriff
probably
has
the
right
to
reassign
him
to
be
an
elevator
operator
from
whence
he
came,
if
that’s
from
whence
he
came
rather
than
or
a
driver
in
the
rest
of
the
department.
i
don’t
think
that
the
constitution
requires
--
mr.
john
c.
tucker
the
sheriff.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
well,
i
don’t
think
anybody
is
going
to
say
he
has
to
give
him
another
job.
if
the
sheriff
discharges
him
and
as
a
practical
matter
if
he
exercises
as
occurred
here,
the
patronage
function
by
discharging
large
numbers
of
people,
a
lawsuit
maybe
filed
alleging
that
this
person
and
others
were
discharged
solely
because
of
their
political
affiliation
and
if
the
burden
of
proof
can
be
sustained
then
that
person
will
recover.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
no,
and
if
he
could
prove
that
he
was
discharged
solely
for
the
exercise
of
his
fundamental
constitutional
rights
he
would
have
a
claim.
i
think
that
the
chances
are
very
many
people
--
you
see,
the
decision
of
this
court
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
might
say,
generally,
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
generally
respected
by
the
people
of
this
country,
including
public
officials.
and
if
this
court
declares,
as
it
seems
to
me
any
analysis
of
the
applicable
constitutional
law
requires,
declares
that
these
practices
are
violative
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
public
officials
will
start
obeying
the
law
just
as
the
public
officials
in
cook
county
have
been
obeying
the
law
under
the
shakman
decree
to
the
result
that
there
has
been
almost
no
litigation
as
a
result
of
it.
public
officials
are
not
about
to
come
out
and
flaunt
the
decree
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
when
it
declares
that
fundamental
constitutional
rights
are
entitled
to
protection
in
this
area.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
among
others
that
there
is
not,
in
my
judgment,
a
great
problem
in
terms
of
any
flood
of
litigation.
but
the
court
has
the
duty
to
vindicate
those
rights.
that’s
if
there
is
any
--
if
there
is
any
clearer
function
of
the
court,
i
don’t
know
what
it
is
than
to
vindicate
the
basic
and
fundamental
constitutional
rights.
we
started
this
or
i
intended
to
start
and
i
guess
i’ll
end
instead
with
mr.
justice
white’s
question
to
mr.
foran,
what
governmental
interest
--
what
governmental
interest
is
served
for
fundamental
constitutional
rights
to
be
able
to
be
infringed
or
to
make
as
a
infringement
a
condition
of
public
employment,
there
has
to
be
a
governmental
interest.
mr.
john
c.
tucker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
