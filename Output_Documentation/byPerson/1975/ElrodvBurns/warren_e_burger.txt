we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
1520,

chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.
foran,
if
the
legislature
of
illinois
wanted
to,
it
could
make
all
of
the
3,000
employees
of
the
sheriff’s
office
subject
to
their
civil
service,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
make
the
sheriff,
barring
some
provision
in
your
constitution,
they
could
make
the
sheriff
a
civil
servant,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
tell
us
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
2800
of
these
people
approximately
or
1800
rather,
about
1800
are
freelancers
and
1200
are
subject
to
the
civil
service
program.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
system
you
described
apply
statewide?
would
you
have
this
in
springfield,
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
last
100
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
political
appointees,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
like
the
parallel
between
congressional
staffs,
the
congressman
picks
all
of
his
staffs
and
when
the
congressman
or
a
senator
is
defeated,
they
all
are
out
of
employment,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
any
civil
servants
working
for
a
senator
or
congressman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tucker?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
sure
this
record
shows
that
in
the
federal
system
or
in
any
of
the
state
systems,
a
tenured
service
came
in
to
being.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
sindermann
case
that
you
referred
to
and
in
i
think
roth,
wasn’t
there
a
considerable
emphasis
placed
on
the
expectation
of
a
continued
employment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
the
whole
area
that
we’re
talking
about
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
court’s
positions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
there
is
no
statutory
scheme,
i
thought
there
was
a
statutory
scheme?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
rights
that
approximately
almost
half
of
the
employees
of
the
sheriff’s
office
are
tenured
civil
service
employees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
a
statutory
scheme,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
with
your
friend,
mr.
foran
that
the
legislature
could
make
everyone
in
the
office
of
the
sheriff
except
the
sheriff
himself
a
tenured
civil
servant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
picked
out
only
1200
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
statutory
construction
that
has
something
to
do
with
this
one,
the
legislative
body
acts
in
one
field
and
doesn’t
act
in
the
same
area
in
another?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’ve
already
said,
isn’t
that
right,
to
that
of
the
sheriff’s
chauffeur
and
his
bodyguard?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
policy-making?
it
isn’t
exclusively
confined
to
policy-making,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who’s
going
to
decide
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
who’s
going
to
decide
whether
the
sheriff
must
give
him
another
job,
a
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
instead
firing
large
blocks,
he
fired
only
one
man
for
--
does
that
change
the
first
--
the
fundamental
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you’re
talking
about
for
that
one
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
74-1520
elrod
against
burns
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.

justice
warren

you
