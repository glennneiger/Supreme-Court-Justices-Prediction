mr.
john
g.
ledes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think,
i
should
devote
the
first
two
minutes
to
removing
this
word
and
phrase
fraud
from
the
discussion
once
and
for
all.
at
page
55a
of
this
appendix
is
the
agreement
in
the
form
prepared
by
curtis.
it
is
there
form,
it
was
prepared
by
in
their
office,
by
their
employees
typed
by
them.
and
the
publisher
is
champion
sports.
significantly,
it
has
no
date.
it
was
signed
on
the
back
side
by
mr.
bert
sugar
on
behalf
of
champion
sports.
not
knowing
when
this
contract
was
signed
we
have
a
great
cause
of
fraud
being
conducted
here
and
we
are
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
we
in
this
ex
parte
proceeding
and
then
under
6223
can
not
address
ourselves
an
affidavits
and
answer
and
take
on
this
challenge
because
in
spite
of
what
my
brothers
have
said,
they
have
not
cited
a
case,
not
one
isolated
singular
case
and
it
is
not
the
law
of
a
new
york
conclusively
there
is
no
right
to
a
hearing
and
evidence.
there
is
no
right
to
adversary
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
has
said
it
three
times;
only
one
case
was
mentioned
in
their
brief
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
reference
to
the
zenith
case
was
in
the
reply
brief.
and
it
was
the
dicta
of
mr.
justice
cardoza,
the
finding
of
the
case
and
the
simple
finding
was
that
there
was
no
statement
of
a
cause
of
action
as
against
defendants
bcd
and
e
by
simple
implication
of
allegations
made
against
a.
you
could
hold
a,
but
you
cannot
hold
bc
and
d,
it
was
a
jurisdictional
defect.
that
was
the
decision;
of
course
mr.
justice
cardoza
took
the
opportunity
of
writing
some
lovely
words
about
the
care
of
the
courts.
it
was
not
finding
of
the
court.
american
reserve
insurance
many
years
later
certainly
made
it
very
clear
that
the
finding
in
zenith
was
correct
two
years
late,
i
believe
it
was,
no
two
years
before,
wulfsohn
made
the
rule.
the
rule
was
clear
in
wulfsohn.
jurisdictional
defects
in
6223
are
not
set
forth
but
it
is
an
inherit
right
that
we
have
got
to
remember
article
62
was
a
creation
of
the
legislature.
what
we
did
inherit
in
the
body
along
the
13th
states
was
certain
basic
common
law
principles.
and
one
of
these
common
law
principles
was
the
right
to
move
against
a
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
for
jurisdictional
reasons.
in
its
interpretation
of
6223
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
three
cases,
wulfsohn,
zenith
and
american
reserve.
and
my
brothers
in
answer
to
your
questions
only
cited
zenith
for
the
dictum
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
do
not
know
impelling
reason
why
the
other
two
cases
were
not
cited.
but
i
would
like
to
continue
my
argument
on
this,
minor
element
of
fraud
and
when
we
refer
to
person
here
as
mr.
sugar
is
a
substantial
person.
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
attorney
general
a
most
interesting
statement
was
made
at
page
5,
impact
on
the
data,
the
appellees
are
utterly
nonsensical
here,
if
sugar
is
“a
most
substantial
citizen”
then
he
should
be
able
to
discharge
the
attachment
cplr
6222,
the
bonding
provision.
the
instant
action
involves
a
commercial
transaction,
the
commercial
transaction
did
not
involve
mr.
sugar
according
to
their
document
except
as
a
signatory
and
i
might
point
out
that
55a
in
the
appendix,
the
contract
has
no
representations
or
warranties
of
ownership
as
a
mandatory
condition
to
the
distribution
arrangement.
and
it
has
that
mystical
last
statement
we
lawyers
prepare
in
one
form,
this
agreement
sets
forth
the
entire
understanding
of
the
bodies
that
went
on
and
and
on
about
nothing
except
things
in
writing
shall
amend
it,
there
is
no
representation
and
warranty
here
of
ownership.
as
an
attorney
and
as
a
publisher

15
years,
i
have
published
over
a
thousand
publications,
90%
of
them

been

but
to
get
back
away
from
the
fraud
and
look
at
the
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court.
there
is
no
question
this
is
a
constitutionally
cognizable
interest.
i
base
my
logic
in
this
matter
before
the
court
on
a
basic
four
point
theory.
the
cognizable
interest,
the
duality
of
the
interest
and
ownership,
the
nature
of

process

mr.
john
g.

your
honor,
i
know
this.
your
honor,
i
would
be
trying
a
case
before
i
could
get
to
the
court
of
appeals,
for
three
to
four
years
in
new

without
a
dime
in

there
is
not
before

it
is

without
a

to
try

mr.
john

your
honor,
i
did
not
say
that
your

i
would
much
prefer
to
try
it
in
the
federal
court
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
your
honor,
the
issue
here
is
how
i
can
get
in

with
this

i
do
not
want
to
go
into
the
deprivations
that
have
taken
place
here
on
my
client
because
its
deals
with
my
point
later
on
on
bonding.
your
honor,
it
was
stated,
i
believe
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
pointing
out
the
bonding
question
that
was
involved
in
di-chem.
fidelity
of

one
of

approached

several
times

they
said
a

would
be
readily
available
if
we
would
deposit
with
them
securities
with
an
adequate
margin
over
the
principal
amount
or
a

in
the
full
amount
and
as
you
appreciate,
your
honor,
if
i
had
either
one
of
the
two,
my
client
did
that,
we
would
not
have
been
bothering
with
this
motion.
we
would
had
the
funds
to
try
this
case.
this
company—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no.
your
honor
let
me
point
out
about
the
debt.
go
into
the
plaintiff’s
appendix
in
the
lower
court
case
which
is
part
of
this
record.
there
are
series
of
five
correspondents
there.
the
debt
has
been
variously
alleged
at
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand,
a
hundred,
a
66,000,
32,000,
67,000
and
17,000
and
might
i
point
out
your
honor
that
the
money
is
not
champion’s,
its
wrestling
revue.
wrestling
revue
was
in
by
virtue
of
these
(inaudible)
to
chance
type
of
practice
we
have
in
new
york.
you
see,
under
this
rule
the
transaction
was
not
as
in
di-chem.
company
a
selling
to
company
b,
company
c
who
was
due
to
receive
the
money
and
have
not
received
it
yet
under
a
contract
of
sale
was
wrapped
in
to
the
deal
by
the
allegations
of
fraud
and
deceit.
so,
unlike
di-chem
and
the
law
as
it
appears
to
be
in
georgia.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
not
necessarily
your
honor.
we
have
that,
as
i
would
look
at
the
di-chem
situation,
it
is
a
simple
commercial
transaction
and
by
the
way
when
we
are
talking
commercial
transactions,
if
we
look
at
the
entire
thing
and
that
we
had
an
announcement
that
the
promissory
note
had
terms
of
garnishment
in
back
of
it,
on
front
of
it
somewhere.
we
have
the
same
situation
in
fuentes,
we
have
the
same
situation
in
the
mitchell.
in
di-chem,
we
had
a
creditor-debtor
relationship.
in
this
case
we
have
a
situation
where
an
individual
has
been
named
supposedly
as
having
committed
fraud.
what
the
fraud
was
or
how
it
was
in
a
licensing
agreement
and
the
company
and
they
attached
the
money.
if
you
look
at
the
money
they
attached
to
mr.
sugar’s,
it
is
absolutely
categorically
clear.
that
is
within
naydeck.
there
is
no
departure,
there
was
no
prior
notice,
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
as
far
as
due
process,
your
honor,
if
i
would
were
to
draft
the
statute
for
new
york
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no.
oh,
no.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
first
of
all,
we
should
have
a
prompt
hearing
on
certain
limited
matters.
the
allegation
and
the
burden
of
proving
not
the
debt
or
the
alleged
debt,
the
fraud,
what
constitutes
the
fraud,
so
that
we
can,
you
see
your
honor
for
us
to
come
in—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
yes.
strictly
that
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
on
the
issue
of
the
debt
your
honor
and
we
have
been
going
around
the
circle
on
that,
i
noticed—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no,
no,
my
adversary
and
i,
my
(inaudible).
on
the
debt
here
your
honor,
we,
they
established
with
the
so-called
debt
in
a
rather
confused
way.
we
have
asked
them
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
with
respect
to
wrestling,
yes.
with
respect
to
champion
upon
which
the
wrestling
situation
exists,
there
must
be
shown
at
least
some
clear,
concise
and
final,
final
numbers
your
honor
because
when
they
attached,
they
attachment
28,000,
and
we
have
a
statement
in
the
file
in
their
handwriting
as
of
may
showing
17,000.
now
what
i
am
trying
to
say
your
honor,
they
have
held
us
by
the
nose
and
by
the
arms
and
they
have
been
punching
us
and
we
do
not
know
if
we
had
the
money
to
pay
it.
and
it
was
within
our
means,
possibly
it
could
have
been
paid
out
of
this
money.
but
we
have
gone
too
far
down
the
road
now,
your
honor.
we
have
been
out
with
this
money
for
three
years.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no,
your
honor.
they
will
at
trial,
have
to
prove.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
oh,
yeah.
on
paper,
yes.
this
would
get
closer,
viz-a-viz
champion
at
a
vendor-vendee
relationship.
but
with
respect
to
wrestling
and
with
respect
to
sugar,
the
standard
was
absolutely
impossible.
and
i
might
point
out
now,
sugar
is
an
indigent.
but
when
i
say
he
a
substantial
man,
he
is
not
that
substantial,
substantial
in
the
community.
if
i
took
the
attorney
general’s
statement
and
took
in
reverse
and
asked
the
question,
if
he
was
not
substantial
would
he
not
be
entitled
to
due
process?
they
infer
that
if
he
had
money,
let
him
go
bond
it.
if
he
does
not
have
money,
which
is
the
interpretation,
they
waived
these
courts
and
new
york
have
viewed
this.
if
you
do
not
have
it
and
you
cannot
defeat
it
by
showing
that
there
is
no
allegation
of
a
cause
of
action
your
debt,
you
got
to
go
to
trial
without
the
money
as
we
do.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
but
for
sure.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
with
live
ones,
because
the
nexus
of
the
grab
here
of
attachment—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
now
your
honor
as
to
the
interpretation
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no.
no
your
honor.
this
is
not
final
judgment
on
the
court.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
the
showing
fraud
has
to
be
made
with
witnesses.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor,i
would
need
a
few
days
to
think
about
that.
i
have
never
looked
at
it
that
way.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
you
need
more
then
probable
cause,
your
honor.
i
would
dare
say
in
my
view
point
for
the
purposes
of
attachment
which
is
a
drastic
remedy,
we
should
reverse
the
standard
set
by
the
court
of
appeals
about
vacating
that
the
plaintiff,
let
us
say
must
ultimately
fail
in
fraud
as
to
fraud,
he
must
put
enough
of
a
case
up
to
show
that
the
plaintiff
most
probably
will
succeed.
most
probably,
because
when
you
put
a
situation
here,
they
are
holding—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor.
i
would
trust
that
they
would
permit
me
the
delight
of
cross
examination
of
the
cause
to
make
it.
but
absent
that
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
most
helpful.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
it
would
be
constitutional.
absolutely
your
honor,
i
would
go
further
than
that,
in
new
york
your
honor,
there
are,
this,
what
was
enacted
here
under
6223
is
most
intriguing
and
i
did
not
take
it
up
in
my
brief
but
it
is
a
simple
logic.
in
new
york
we
have
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
we
have
a
motion
also
available
to
us
to
dismiss
the
action
for
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action.
these
motions
are
not
statutory.
they
came
down
with
us
200
some
odd
years
ago,
200
to
be
precise.
we
inherited
this
right.
these
are
motions
that
strangely
enough
were
not
expanded
upon
when
they
gave
the
statutory
right
to
garnish.
in
fact
it
was
constricted.
those
very
motions
were
constricted.
if
you
read
6223,
there
is
a
provision
in
6223
that
is
most
interesting.
in
6223
the
provision
states
very
clearly
that
the
court
must
mandatorily
give
the
plaintiff
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
defect.
in
effect,
6223
took
from
us
the
statute,
not
the
statutory,
the
inherit
right
to
attack.
if
we
can—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no,
your
honor,
the
garnishment
statute.
what
i
am
saying
is
the
garnishment
statutes
took
the
standard
that
pre-existed,
it
did
not
open
up
an
opportunity
as
been
argued
for
an
adversary
hearing.
there
is
not
a
case
in
this
whole
file
that
talks
about
adversary
hearings.
in
fact,
6223
took
from
us
what
we
had
under,
i
think
it
was
3002
or
3112,
it
took
from
us
the
right
to
strike
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
because
under
6223
on
which
we
could
collect
damages.
we
had
to
give
up
something.
they
apparently
thought
we
should,
the
motion
be
part,
6223
is
enactable,
unusable
because
it
gives
you
the
opportunity
of
correcting
the
plaintiff’s
defects
because
the
statute
specifically
says
that
upon
the
motion,
meaning
6223,
the
court
shall
give
the
plaintiff
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
correct
any
defect.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no,
i
am,
no,
not,
what
i
am
simply
saying
your
honor,
make
6223.
the
creation
of
a
right
by
the
legislature,
we
did
indeed
because
it,
we
have
this
right
before
to
vacate
by
puling
the
rug,
the
complaint
out
from
under
the
attachment.
but
they
put
6223
probably
prophetically
to
think
some
75
or
80
years
later
i
would
be
arguing
here.
so
that
someone
could
argue,
we
have
a
right
to
a
hearing.
we
had
the
right
to
that
hearing
back
in
those
days.
this
so-called
hearing
is
a
gig.
in
new
york,
the
cases
are
unambiguously
clear
and
the
cases
they
cite
most
of
which
i
have
referred
to
in
my
brief
deal
with
jurisdictional
points
in
maitrejean,
there
was
a
failure,
very
levy
on
on
properties
which
is
a
low,
it
is
an
appellate
division
case
dismissed,
it
did
not
fail
to
establish
a
prima-facie
case
of
any
intent
to
defraud.
case
after
case
after
case
but
those
cases
and
those
judges
were
very
good.
they
took—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
i
would
read
the
statute
as
being
worse
than
georgia.
because—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
oh,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor
there
is
no
case,
against
your
question,
there
is
no
case
that
so
states
nor
is
there
a
case,
what
has
happened
is
the
judiciary
through
this
might
point
to
it
the
statute
is
so
involved
in
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor,
the
only
time
i
came
close
to
it,
and
it
was
an
argument
of
the
motion
and
that
happened
where
an
attachment
was
based
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
the
answer
is
no.
i
have
never
known,
i
have
never,
and
i
do
not
think
they
are
ever
going
to
find
a
case
with
a
hearing
with
witnesses.
i
know
there
is
none,
your
honor.
and
i
might
point
out
in
the
motion
practice
in
new
york,
a
judge
does
sign
the
writ.
we
go
up
with
the
papers
and
we
give
it
to
the
clerk
and
those
are
really
competent
clerks
there.
they
are
usual
guys,
they
go
through
and
make
all
the
corrections
and
i
must
say
i’ve
tried
about
eight
to
ten
times
on
very
important
point
to
try
to
get
in
to
see
a
judge.
i
have
never
been
successful
in
20
years
of
motion
practice.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor,
the
only
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
judge
bryan
(ph)
called
me
up
and
said
what
is
this
all
about
(inaudible)
mr.
john
g.
ledes
which
judge?
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
that
is
their
statements.
your
honor
judge
fine
who—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor,
i
am
stating
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
there
are
corrections
made
either
by
the
judge
or
by
the
clerk.
i
am
no
position
sir.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no,
your
honor
i
deny
that
the
judge
did
that.
it
was
signed
by
him.
but
i
dint
know
and
i
cannot
personally
say,
they
make
that
allegation
in
this,
in
their
brief.
but
i
know
what
my
experience
is,
your
honor
we
bring
it
and
we
never
get
by
the
clerk.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor
i
can
cite
a
specific
case
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
do
you
go
directly
to
the
judge
as
i
did
to
make
the
argument
with
the
certificate
of
doing
business
or
incorporation
in
new
york,
as
matter
of
publisher’s
press
versus
ms
publishing,
and
if
that
judge,
judge
amsterdam
does
not
hear
you
and
she
did
not,
she
refused
to
hear
me,
i
went
on
an
oral
motion
to
the
appellate
division
and
was
heard
by
judge
melchowitz(ph)
and
i
presented
the
document
to
him
and
he
heard
me
strictly
on
the
issue
of
whether
we
were
doing
business
and
nothing
else.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
the
disposes
of
the
attachment
in
that
particular
case—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor,
it
is
how
you
read
it.
they
say
vacate
or
to
vacate
or
provide
it
which
--
mr.
john
g.
ledes
(inaudible)
of
course,
no
it
does
not
preclude
that.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
yes.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
your
honor,
jurisdiction—
mr.
john
g.
ledes
yes.
they
were
cited,
several
of
them.
they
stated
as
i
used
to
phrase
in
my
brief
about
sweeping
in
the
jurisdictional
decree.
if
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
under
the
garnishment
statute
and
by
the
cases
to
find
in
for
the
general
jurisdiction
right,
its
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action
and
there
are
dozens
of
them.
as
i
mentioned
the
zenith
taking
case
about
a
hall
and
five
men
and
all
that
jazz.
there
was
just,
there
were
numerous
reasons
and
the
courts
do
dismiss.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
yes.
that
is
the
only
factual
basis
expressly
specified
by
this
statute
and
it
was
written
into
the
books
as
my
brother
busner
here
pointed
out
twelve
years
ago
to
accommodate
the
non-resident
aspects
of
the
attachment
statute.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
no.
in
fact,
i
would
go
further
your
honor.
i
would
think
6223
would
not
have
precluded
the
courts
of
new
york
to
conduct
an
adversary
hearing
and
i
might
point
out
at
appendix
b
--
very
kindly
the
attorney
general’s
brief
of
new
york
cited
regnell
versus
page,
at
page
37,
the
civil
court,
the
court
below
supreme
new
york,
the
court
of
common
pleas,
the
presiding
administrative
justice
thompson
set
forth
the
rule
that
all
orders
of
attachment
must
provide
that
the
plaintiff
within
three
days
after
levy
shall
move
unnoticed
of
the
defendant,
the
garnishee
and
the
sheriff
will
leave
to
prove
the
grounds
upon
which
the
order
of
attachment
was
issued.
the
burden
of
proof
on
such
a
motion
is
on
the
plaintiff
and
the
attachment
will
be
deemed
vacated
if
such
a
motion
is
not
made.
your
honor
the
courts
for
eight
years
had
the
opportunity
of
interpreting
the
statute.
so
that
they
could
build
it
up
but
we
have
reached
the
(inaudible)
here.
eighty
years
later,
about
the
way
this
case,
this
law
could
have
been
structured
by
the
court,
but
its
too
broad
and
too
rambling
and
with
the
public
and
the
defendants
in
this
area
have
been
--
my
defendant
wrestling
revue,
the
moving
party
in
this
case
is
totally
out
of
business,
its
been
wiped
out.
i
am
in
this
case
because
i
have
a
stubborn
individual
named
sugar
who
went
to
law
school
which
may
have
been
a
problem
with
his
mentality
wanted
to
take
this
case
and
to
scrape
the
money
up.
i
am
in
this
court
simply
because
we
have
had
no
opportunity
to
even
prepare
our
case
on
the
bare
allegation
and
here
we
have
no
right
to
a
hearing
and
the
court
for
all
these
years
has
never
set
down
the
standard.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
for
the
purposes
of
vacating
the
attachment,
it
would
be
my
view
point,
a
full
adversary
hearing
where
the
plaintiff
would
have
had
the
burden
to
show
that
it
would
probably
succeed
in
proving
its
fraud
allegation.
mr.
john
g.
ledes
i
would
add
one
phrase
on
the
statute
and
the
cases
interpreting
that
very
broad
amorphous
statute.
thank
you.
