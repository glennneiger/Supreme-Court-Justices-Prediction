unknown
speaker
verified
complaint,
isn’t
it?
he
has
to
take
the
same
recitals
that
as
were
contained,
i
suppose
in
the
affidavit
and
as
you
have
orally
told
us.
unknown
speaker
and
the
complaint
was
submitted
to
the
judge
along
with
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
and
you
contend
you
have
pocket
process.
you
still
do,
do
not
you?
when
you
file
a
complaint,
the
first
that
anything
gets
in
the
filed
at
a
court
in
new
york,
as
if
this
is,
this
used
to
be
true
as
i
understand
it,
and
tell
me
if
it
is
still
true.
first
time
anything
gets
filed
in
the
court
is
when
you
ask
the
court
for
some
sort
of
action.
unknown
speaker
the
issues
here
involve
all
three
sub
paragraphs
four,
five
and
eight
of
6201.
or
just—
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
fraud
or
the
inception
of
contract?
unknown
speaker
eight
is
an
action
for
fraud
or
deceit.
unknown
speaker
was
their
any
finding
here
that
these
assets
would
be
wasted
so
as
to
the
defendant
would
be
judgment
proof?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
new
york
law
permitted
a
seizure
attachment
prior
to
any
notice
or
hearing
and
then
provided
and
for,
no
hearing
whatsoever
after
the
attachment
and
prior
final
hearing
and
judgment
on
whether
or
not
the
attachment
was
proper,
would
you
argue
that
that
law
was
valid?
unknown
speaker
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
and
that
goes
broader
than
whether
or
not
there
may
be
a
danger
of
loosing
the
asset?
you
have
to
--
wouldn’t
you
agree
it
has
to
go
to
at
least
to
some
extent
to
the
merits
of
the
basic
claim?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
whatever
it
is
that,
it
has
to
bear
on
that
claim
to
that
extent.
unknown
speaker
perhaps,
that
is
so
(inaudible)
or
plaintiffs
have
some
merits?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
been
kind
of
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
new
york
courts
decided
these
later
case?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
with
that?
unknown
speaker
does
this
development
--
since
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
suggests
that
they
should
a
vacation
and
remand
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
new
york
decision?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
the
three-judge
court
looked
at
the
new
york
law
and
it
cited
what
it
thought
were
controlling
authorities
in
new
york,
including
cases
in
courts
higher
than
the
courts
that
had
a
adapted
since
the
decision.
do
you
think
they--
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do
not
agree
with
our
reading
of
it
but
nevertheless
they
read
it,
they
read
new
york
law
that
way.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sure,
it
is
most
unusual
for
this
court
to
reexamine
findings
of
federal
district
or
courts
of
appeals
at
matters
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
you
can
have
this
argument
anytime
since
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
opportunity
that
the
defendant
must
have
to
either
extract
from
you
or
to
have
you
make
a
showing
and
through
the
validity
of
your
case,
do
you
think
that
showing
can
be
wholly
satisfied
with
papers?
with
just
affidavits?
unknown
speaker
the
defendant
moves
to
set
aside
the
attachment
after
the
submission
ex
parte
and
you
agree
that
there
is
open
--
an
issue
on
the
merit?
do
you
think
that
he
is
entitled
to
require
that
you
have
a
live
witness
there
or
with
an—
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
do
you
think
that
you
have
to
make
any
showing
other
than
on
the
merits
other
than
what
you
demonstrated
ex
parte
to
give
the
attachment?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
get
to
an
oral
hearing
at
all?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
new
york
law
now
makes
adequate
provisions
for
whatever
hearing,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to—
unknown
speaker
and
i
am
just
trying
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
he
is
entitled
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
say
you
do
not
--
at
this
hearing
after
the
initial
seizure
to
which
you
think
the
defendant
is
entitled
to,
you
are
suggesting
that
the
plaintiff
need
not
how
anything
other
than
what
he
has
already
showing
in
an
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
the
big
difference
is
as
i
understand
it,
the
post
attachment
hearing
is
an
adversary
hearing
at
which
the
defendant
may
be
present
and
take
part,
he
makes
the
motion
that
there
is
pre-attachment
hearing
is
ex
parte.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
big
difference,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
is
then
there
is
the
possibility,
the
opportunity
depending
on
the
facts
of
circumstances
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
after
the
attachment.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wanted
to
make
that
clear.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
he
had
made
it
a
very
bad
mistake.
your
computer
has
blown
a
fuse
or
something
and
but
he
--
certainly,
it
would
be
no
time
to
resolve
differences
in
conflicts
over
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
how
often
in
your
practice,
have
you
ever
had
an
application
turned
down?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
the
record
shows
that
it
happens
or
you
make
a
just
a
general
statement.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenwald,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
motion
to
vacate
may,
in
some
circumstances
not
carry
with
it,
a
general
appearance
by
the
defendant
whereas
in
some
situations
it
would
be
a
general
appearance.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
statute
indicate
that
it
can
be
made
without
entering
a
general
appearance.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
wondering
if
there
is
any
difference
in
the
scope
of
the
grounds
which
may
be
asserted
for
vacating
the
attachment
as
between
the
two
kinds
of
motions.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
the
district
court
has
misread
the
new
york,
applicable
new
york
laws
but
what
is
open
on
the
motion
to
vacate
the
attachment.
unknown
speaker
the
state
was
a
party
at
that
point
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
did
you
support
any
of
the
motions
to
abstain?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
abstention
was
just
a
stay
in
the
federal
action
until
any
state
law
issues
would
be
settled.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
a
dismissal
so
that
all
the
issues
including
the
federal
issues
could
be
settled
in
the
pending
state
court.
unknown
speaker
that
kind
of
a
motion
was
never
made,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
question
here,
maybe
you
know
your
colleagues?
that
the
error
here
was
not
abstaining.
unknown
speaker
subsumed
are
there
any
other
question
present?
unknown
speaker
if
you
do
this
sue
sponte,
even
you
though
you
have
presented
question.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
lacks
jurisdiction
in
this
circumstance
or
that
ordinarily
will
not
exercise
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenwald
you
have
got
kind
of
a
tough
road
to
hold.
if
you
are
simply
asking
us
to
superimpose,
our
judgment
as
to
new
york
law
on
that
of
three
new
york
federal
judges
all
of
whom
were
at
one
time
new
york
practitioners,
i
think
you
have
got
to
put
it
to
a
some
other
way
than
simply
for
us
to
announce
what
new
york
law
is.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
might
cite
an
earlier
diversity
case
in
about
337
u.s.
where
this
court
did
hold
that
a
south
carolina
trial
court
decision
was
binding
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
the
absence
of
any
pronouncement
from
a
higher
court
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
or
other
cases
where
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals’
decision
has
been
held
expressive
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)three-judge
court
here
though
cite
court
of
appeals
cases.
unknown
speaker
and
they
relied
on
the
highest
court
in
the
state
for
its
enclosure.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
are
going
to
say
they
misread
this.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
gather
is
that
the
three-judge
court
simply
as
you
have
said
earlier,
“misread”
new
york
law.
you
are
not
familiar
with
the
helaki
(ph)
case
in
this
case
court,
are
you?
that
happen
to
be
a
case
in
which
the
second
circuit
read
the
new
jersey
law
as
expressed
in
the
opinion
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
a
way
that
was
clearly
wrong.
and
yet
this
court
said
it
could
not
review
it
and
the
reason
i
felt
distressed
about
it
was
that
i
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
i
was
a
member
of
that
court.
and
i
knew
how
wrong
it
was
but
yet
this
court
would
not
review
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
as
to
what
new
jersey
law
was.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
believe.
but
then
when
you
answered,
mr.
justice
white,
if
the
three-judge
court
properly
stated
new
york
law
then
its
judgment
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
are,
what
if
they
are?
how
about
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question,
if
the
issue
is
as
limited
on
the
motion,
as
the
three-judge
court
said
that
it
was
or
they
were,
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
submit,
you
are
entitled
to
hear
as
far
as
due
process
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
suggest
you
are
entitled
to
a
pre-seizure
hearing
of
any
kind?
unknown
speaker
and
you,
but
you
do
suggest
that
within
a
reasonably
promptly
thereafter
you
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
that
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
attachment
before
judgment
was
justified.
unknown
speaker
now
how
about
the
merits
of
the
case?
how
about
on
the,
whether
there
was
a
debt?
unknown
speaker
and
i
have
not
--
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
they
have
any?
in
that
hearing,
do
you
think
when
the
hearing
is
held,
do
you
think
that
the
other
side,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
has
to
show
anything
more
than
what
he
has
already
shown,
namely,
affidavits
and
a
decent
paper
case.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not,
if
they
refine
their
papers
showing,
it
would
be
enough,
you
do
not
suggest
they
have
to
call
witnesses
and
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
can
make
their
case
adequately
on
paper
if
they
--
unknown
speaker
now,
lets
go
back
a
minute
to
the
fraud
part.
i
take
it
you
are
saying
that
in
the
post
attachment
hearing,
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
has
to
go
forward
with
some
evidence
beyond
what
he
is
already,
alleged
in
his
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
with
live
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
what
your
claim
is
with
respect
to
what
due
process
requires?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
think
that
this
is
the
final
judgment
on
the
fraud?
unknown
speaker
how
much
of
a
showing
of
fraud
that
has
to
be
made?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
what
is
the
standard,
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
this
is
what,
this
is
inherent
and
this
is
what
the
issue
is
here
with
respect
to
whether
new
york
law
is
deficient
or
not.
unknown
speaker
when
you
make
your
motion,
you
are
entitled
to
walk
in
the
court
room
and
sit
there
and
being
holy,
silent
until
and
unless
the
plaintiff
produces
evidence
and
live
witnesses
to
sufficiently
to
demonstrate
fraud
to
the
level
that
you
have
just
suggested.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
prevent
something
from
amending
their
complaint?
that
is
nonsense.
unknown
speaker
could
i
interrupt
for
just
a
minute
to
help
me
out
on
the
new
york
law.
you
read
this
statute
as
precluding
an
evidentiary
hearing
as
i
understand
it.
it
does
not
say
it—
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
get
my
question
out
before
you
try
to
answer.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
find
any
words
in
the
statute
that
say
that
judge
may
not
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing.
i
think
it
specifies
one
ground
on
which
he
must
vacate
the
attachment
but
as
i
would
read
that
it
might
be
optional
with
the
judge
to
do
it.
is
there
a
case
which
squarely
holds
that
it
would
be
error
for
the
judge
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
a
motion
to
vacate?
unknown
speaker
in
area
of
the
law,
have
you
ever
been
involved
in
a
case
in
which
a
trial
judge
did
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
a
motion
to
vacate?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
let
me
put
a
simple
case
to
you
and
get
away
from
the
complications
of
this
case.
one
of
the
grounds
for
attachment
in
new
york
is
that
the
defendant
is
a
non-resident
of
the
state.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
let
us
assume
you
have
an
attachment
in
which
the
only
ground
alleged
is
that
the
defendant
is
not
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york.
unknown
speaker
you
have
the
right
under
6223
to
make
a
motion.
you
represent
the
defendant
and
you
know
he
is
a
resident
of
new
york.
you
make
your
motion,
what
do
you
say
to
the
judge?
does
he
give
you
an
opportunity
to
say
that
your
client
is
not
a
resident
of
new
york?
unknown
speaker
my
question
first.
unknown
speaker
prevailed
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
a
resident.
that
would
dispose
of
the
attachment
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
i
am
asking
you
at
the
moment.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
in
your
argument
that
6223
allowed
the
dismissal
of
an
attachment
only
for
the
grounds
specified
by
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
will
put
it
to
you
this
way.
in
light
of
what
the
three-judge
district
court
said,
do
you
read
its
decision
as
preventing
a
state
judge
in
new
york
from
dismissing
an
attachment
on
the
ground
that
you
have
demonstrated
that
the
defendant
does
live
in
the
state
of
new
york?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
preclude
that
so
that
is
at
least
one
other
ground
on
which
an
attachment
may
be
dismissed
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
number
of
other
grounds,
if
the
defendant
proves
there
is
no
ground
for
attachment
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
seven
or
eight
of
them.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)basis
that
is
that
the
security
of
the
defendant
or
the
plaintiff
is
not
implicated
by
the
attachment.
that
the
only
factual
basis,
that
is
what
the
three-judge
court
said.
unknown
speaker
we
have
6223
as
denying
to
the
trial
judge
the
right
to
consider
any
proper
ground
that
you
may
present
for
the
dismissal
of
the
attachment,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ledes,
let
me
just
go
over
it
once
more
if
i
may
cause
i
am
still
thinking
of
your
questioning
with
mr.
justice
white.
the
issue
you
wanted,
the
issue
you
wanted
to
have
tried
in
the
new
york
courts
but
under
your
view
of
the
law
could
not
have
tried
is
not
the
issue
of
fraud,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the,that
is
the
critical
defect
that
you
did
not
have
the
right
by
statute
to
a
hearing
on
the
fraud
issue
at
which
the
burden
would
have
been
on
the
plaintiff
to
establish
probable
cause
if
he
could
prevail.
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
asking
the
strongest
case.
unknown
speaker
i
will
change
the
question.
is
there
a
new
york
case
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
that
sheds
any
light
on
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
what
page
on
the
brief
is
that?
