mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
importance
of
the
question
on
this
appeal
is
rather
obvious
certainly
to
the
state
of
new
york
because
it
brings
into
issue,
the
types
of
situations
where
the
provisional
remedy
of
attachment
is
proper
and
constitutional
basically
of
course
the
remedy
of
attachment
is
an
ex
parte
order.
and
this
type
of
order,
this
ex
parte
type
of
order
has
been
a
matter
of
frequent
concern
to
this
court
in
the
past
several
years.
in
fact,
this
is
the
fourth
time,
i
think
within
the
last
three
or
four
years
that
this
type
of
issue
has
come
before
this
court.
and
i
think
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
in
what
circumstances
preliminary
relief
can
be
granted
ex
parte
in
a
manner
in
the
court
with
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
of
course
while
the
broad
outlines
are
available
in
this
area
and
most
recently
in
mitchell
against
w.
t.
grant
and
north
georgia
against
di-chem,
many
of
the
specifics
are
still
in
doubt
in
the
subject
of
much
discussion.
i
think
the
lower
court
decision
and
order
in
this
instant
case
is
a
demonstration
of
the
confusion
that
exists
in
this
area.
now,
i
think
we
should
consider
the
basic
rule
or
basic
procedure
that
sequestrations
or
as
in
louisiana
or
in
the
mitchell
and
attachments
issue
ex
parte
and
it
is
also
clear
that
the
fact
of
issues
ex
parte
is
constitutional.
and
that
the
mere
postponement
of
judicial
inquiry
is
not
a
violation
of
due
process.
however,
i
also
recognize
that
there
are
safeguards
necessary
when
ex
parte
order
is
issued.
and
in
this
regard
mitchell,
the
mitchell
case
is
an
example
of
some
of
those
safeguards
or
what
types
of
safeguards
are
sufficient.
but
due
process
of
course
is
not
inflexible.
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
say
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
the
decision
of
di-chem
is
an
example
of
what
is
absolutely
unacceptable.
now,
as
to
the
purpose
of
attachment,
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
that
new
york
has
a
sufficient
purpose
for
granting
attachments
in
this
area
which
are
basically
fraud.
but
that
is
a
security
aspect.
of
course
there
is
another
aspect
jurisdiction
which
is
not
involved
in
the
decision
here
but
as
i
say
we
are
dealing
with
the
security
type
of
attachment.
this
is
where
the
state
seeks
to
protect
the
ultimate
collectability
of
a
judgment
rather
than
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance.
and
of
course,
in
new
york
these
type
of
security
attachments
are
only
allowed
in
certain
specified
instances.
they
are
not
available
in
every
law
suit,
you
can
not
just
because
you
have
a
lawsuit,
get
an
attachment
or
seek
one.
and,
i
would
further
state
that
it
is
a
point
for
the
legislature
to
determine
that
you
need
the
remedy
of
attachment
in
this
fraud
situation.
fraud
of
course
is
pernicious
vice
and
it
always
has
been
a
concern,
i
think
to
any,
to
courts
and
the
legislature.
now,
in
the
court
judgment
opinion
below,
they
seem
to
make
a
finding
that
because
the
attaching
party
in
the
instant
case,
did
not
have
a
vendor’s
lien
that
it
only
had
a
claim
of
fraud
that
it
also
had
some
evidence
that
assets
were
being
secreted
or
taken
out
of
the
state,
that
attachment
should
not
be
necessary.
i
submit
that,
in
view
of
the
legitimate
purpose
of
the
attachment
in
the
instant
case,
that
finding
of
determination
is
an
error
because
it
basically
prevents
a
state
from
ever
protecting
its
citizens
against
this
type
of
fraud
situation.
i
would
also
submit
that
it
is
an
unduly
narrow
reading
of
the
holding
of
mitchell
against
w.
t.
grant
or
the
tenure
of
that
decision
and
i
would
also
submit
that
this
view
that
it
is
narrow
reading
of
mitchell
was
confirmed
by
this
courts
opinion
in
the
di-chem
case
where
the
georgia
attachment
of
garnishment
statute
was
struck
down
and
the
matter
of
vendor’s
lien
was
not
even
mentioned,
never
mentioned
once.
i
think
it
still
remains
the
rule,
as
it
was
many
years
stated
that
it
is
for
the
legislature
to
determine
what
circumstances
in
an
attachment
shall
be
granted
and
of
course,
it
is
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
facts
of
any
particular
case
warrant
the
remedy
of
attachment.
now,
as
i
have
noted
the
prevention
of
fraud
is
an
important
state
interest.
this
was
even
recognized
in
the
case
of
fuentes
against
shevin
as
one
of
its
exceptions
to
the
prior
assertion
of
state
power
ex
parte
and
i
submit
that
this
assertion
by
the
state
of
its
interest
in
prevention
of
fraud
or
secretion
of
assets
or
rendering
uncollectible
judgment
should
be
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
instant
case
because
as
in
mitchell
it
avoids
self-help.
if
you
do
not
have
this
remedy
available
you
will
have
instances
of
self-help
and
since
by
the
way,
this
is
a
commercial
case,
it
does
facilitate
commerce.
now,
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
while
we
do
have
the
question
of
fraud,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
importance
to
be
placed
upon
the
fact
that
in
new
york
a
judge
issues
the
writ
of
attachment.
there
is
judicial
supervision
at
every
step
of
the
way.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
and
this
court
has
placed
emphasis
on
the
judicial
function,
it
is
not
just
that
a
judge
is
a
more
powerful
official
than
a
clerk
or
a
neutral
official.
it
is
rather
and
i
emphasize
this
that
he
can
exercise
discretion.
he
can
determine
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action,
whether
there
are
evidentiary
facts
to
support
the
remedy.
in
new
york
indeed,
even
if
the
papers
formally
support
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
attachment,
a
judge
in
his
discretion
can
still
refuse
to
grant
that
writ.
it
is
not
just
simply
plugging
in
the
numbers
of
new
york
and
getting
your
writ
of
attachment.
that
is
quite
different
from
many
other
states.
i
submit
it
is
quite
different
even
from
louisiana
statute
or
the
facts
of
the
louisiana
mitchell
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
absolutely
not.
indeed
the
facts
of
this
case
as
i
understand
them
are
that
my
co-counsels,
the
attorney
for
the
private
party
went
up
to
justice
bryan
(ph)
with
his
affidavits
and
further
papers
and
i
might
add,
he
was
then
sent
back
for
further
proof
for
evidence.
he
just
did
not
go
once
and
get
the
writ
of
attachment,
he
had
to
produce
more.
the
judge
would
not
sign
this
order
of
attachment
without
even
more.
there
are
no
standard
forms
in
new
york,
we
have
forms
of
publishers
i
dare
say,
there
are
no
standard
forms
in
new
york
for
checking
the
boxes
and
getting
a
writ
of
attachment.
i
have
seen
such
examples
of
such
forms
in
other
states
for
getting
writs
of
attachment.
indeed
i
feel,
that
is
rather
obvious
in
the
mitchell,
louisiana
situation
that
you
have
the
standard
points
asserted
and
you
will
get
your
sequestrations.
but
that
is
certainly
not
the
case
in
new
york.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
would
say
i
have
never
made
an
application
for
writ
of
attachment.
i
am
in
the
attorney
general’s
office.
we
do
not
practice
generally
commercial
law
or
at
least
my
section
does
not.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
but
i
think
mr.
busner,
my
co-counsel
mr.
busner
has
stated
that
it
has
happened
to
him,
i
believe
it
does
happen
but
that
is
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
am
just
making
a
general
statement.
it
is
not
part
of
the
record.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
mr.
justice
marshall,under
the
new
york
law
as
soon
as
the
defendant
learns
of
the
attachment,
he
can
immediately
move
under
cplr
6223
to
vacate
that
attachment.
the
grounds
under
which
he
can
move
are
as
broad
as
the
grounds
upon
which
the
attachment
was
granted.
he
can
challenge
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
he
can
challenge
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidentiary
facts
there.
he
can
raise
factual
issues.
he
can
also,
and
this
is
a
final
ground,
he
can
also
state
that
the
security
is
unnecessary
to
the
plaintiff.
now,
that
last
point
which
was
the
district
court's
conclusion
as
the
only
ground
led
to
an
inference
that
while
the
grounds
of
the
attachment
might
not
have
been
proven,
if
it
was
still
necessary
to
the
security
of
the
plaintiff,
that
attachment
would
stand
and
that
is
error.
i
submit
that
is
fundamental
error
because
there
are
other
grounds.
it
was
the
basis
of
the
lower
courts
decision
that
you
really
did
not
get
a
meaningful
hearing
or
opportunity
to
vacate
the
attachment
in
new
york.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
all
of
these
grounds
are
matters
of
judicial
interpretation.
this
case
does
involve
a
great
deal
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
what?
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes
this
could
--
in
the
proper
circumstances,
yes,
there
would
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
of
course.
you
would
have
to
make
that
if
the
point
that
you
make
is
a
factual
question
you
would
get
with
live
witnesses.
now,
the
example,
would
like
to
give
is
when
you
make
that
unnecessary
to
the
security
of
the
plaintiff
grounds.
that
is
basically
on
jurisdictional
attachments.
the
defendant
would
say
for
example,
and
i
have
a
case
cited
in
my
brief,
i
think
maitrejean
in
the
appellate
division,
that
i
am
a
national
corporation,
i
have
millions
of
dollars
in
assets,
i
am
not
going
any
place,
i
have
appeared
in
the
case,
you
have
jurisdiction.
factually,
you
do
not
need
this
security.
now,
of
course
if
the
plaintiff
wanted
to
challenge
this
point,
he
could
bring
in
his
witnesses.
but
the
point
is,
there
are
factual
issues
often
times
involved,
but
normally
in
new
york,
as
my
co-counsel
has
said,
it
is
a
matter
legal
argument
by
attorneys.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
it
will
go
on
the
regular
motions
calendar
in
new
york
county,
where
the
writ
of
attachment
was
issued
here,
it
was
a
special,
what
the
judge,
the
ex
parte
judge
signs
the
attachment
and
issues
the
writ
and
if
you
make
a
motion
to
vacate
those
on
the
regular
litigated
motions
part
and
another
judge
would
normally
hear
it,
in
smaller
counties,
often
times
if
it
is
done
very
quickly
the
same
judge
will
hear
it.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
in
some
circumstances
it
might
not
be
a
general
appearance.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes.
that
is
jurisdictional
attachments
and
once
again
we
are
not
involved
with
that
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
you
would
normally
get
into
the
factual
issues
more
frequently
with
jurisdictional
attachments
such
as
you
get
a
jurisdictional
attachment
because
the
defendant
is
a
non-resident.
he
may
assert
the
fact
that
he
is
a
resident
and
then
you
have
a
factual
issue,
is
he
or
is
he
not
a
resident.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
as
far
this,
the
fraud
type
attachment,
the
defendant
is
or
is
about
to
or
has
secreted
assets
and
while
this
may
be
a
ultimate
factual
issue
there
have
been
evidentiary
facts
submitted
on
the
ex
parte
application
to
support
this
inference.
and
once
again,
i
emphasize
that
on
the
motion
to
vacate,
you
are
not
trying
the
complete
of
cause
action,
you
are
not
trying
the
defendant’s
defenses
to
the
cause
of
action,
and
i
would
submit
also
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
is
the
same
situation
as
in
a
louisiana
or
mitchell
motion
to
vacate
in
hearing,
you
are
not
trying
the
defenses.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
it
is
most
certainly
has
misread
the
applicable
new
york
law
and
i
wish
to
emphasize
this
court
that
in
the
area
or
of
what
is
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
it
is
the
courts
of
the
state
new
york,
that
state
that
law.
and
most
clearly
because
this
has
never
really
been
an
issue
in
the
state
of
new
york
since
the
lower
court
decision
here
as
has
been
stated
any
number
of
state
courts
have
stated
that
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
otherwise
and
the
lower
court
said
it
was.
and
indeed
the
point
of
abstention
had
been
raised
previously
and
i
believe,
there
was
some
issue
of
whether
to
be
the
abstention
to
get
an
interpretation
of
new
york
state
law
or
the
younger
type
of
abstention.
the
lower
court
determined,
number
one:
that
it
did
not
have
to
abstain
in
the,
as
to
what
new
york
law
was
because
it
was
positive,
it
was
clear.
of
course,
the
more
positive
a
person,
more
frequently,
i
submit
he
is
in
error,
and
that
was
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
leading
new
york
commentators.
leading
new
york
judges,
new
york
state
court
judges
said,
“gee-whiz!
that
is
just
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
the
state,
the
attorney
general’s
office
has
been
a
party
for
this
case
in
this
very
inception.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
we
had
raised,
yes,
the
issue
of
abstention,
i
did
not
basically—
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
i
submit
that
it
was
different.
basically
i
am
now
arguing
also
for
younger
type
abstention.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
quite
correct,
because
it
might
be
very
well
not
be
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes
it
was
basically
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
convening
judge
in
his
opinion
stated,
and
this
is,
i
correct
my
brief,
the
convening
judge
said
that
was
an
issue
for
the
three-judge
court,
so
he
was
not
passing
on
it
quite
correctly.
then
in
the
body
of
the
three-judge
court
decision
it
did
not
even
mention
abstention.
and
frankly,
i
did
not
push
it
because
at
that
time
the
case
of
hoffman
against
persu
(ph)
had
not
been
decided
and
it
was
generally
considered
that
abstention
only
applied
solely
to
criminal
cases.
but
the
three-judge
court
opinion,
in
a
footnote,
i
think
it
is
footnote,
one
of
the
last
footnote
stated,
the
single
judge
has
already
decided
that
this
is
not
a
proper
case
to
abstain
and
by
the
way
the
same
judge
who
wrote
the
convening
opinion
wrote
the
three-judge
court
opinion
so
you
have
a
complete
circle.
he
says
first
time,
i
am
not
going
to
decide
it
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
that
is
frankly
true.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
grant
that
it
was
not.
but
i
do
think
it
is
subsumed
and
in
the
sense
that
i
really
think
that
in
this
area,
this
court
should
recognize
the
discretion
of
a
judge
in
granting
or
denying
this
writ.
there
is
a
basic
element
of
comedy
here,
you
have
here
in
this
case,
two
state
court
judges
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
admit
it
is
not
one
of
the
questions
presented
and
it
was
not
one
of
the
questions
presented
on
our
jurisdictional
statement
but
i
do
think
frequently,
if
this
is
in
the
proper
circumstances,
this
court
does
render
such
a
judgment
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
it
is
more
than
your
honor,
no,
justice
white,
its
more
than
you
should
disagree.
you
do
not
have
to
disagree.
you
have
to
and
it
has
been
often
said
by
this
court,
you
have
to
agree
with
what
the
state
court
say,
state
court
law
is.
and
there
was
an
issue
raised
or
question
raised
about
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
this
is
a
provisional
remedy;
it
is
not
a
final
judgment.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
quite
limited,
it
is
basically
limited
to
final
judgments.
it
only
gets
these
issues
after
final
judgment
and
whether
an
attachment
ever
survives
all
of
that
procedural
matter
is
questionable.
indeed,
i
would
say
the
only
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
it
in
self
under
the
statute
i
believe
lacks
jurisdiction.
it
is
possible
that
the
appellate
division
itself
would
certify
the
question
but
that
is
a
very
rare
circumstance.
and
indeed,
the
appellate
divisions
can
pass
on
questions
of
fact
and
law,
they
exercise
of
discretion
by
that
judge
who
even,
besides
getting
motions
to
vacate,
you
can
appeal
in
new
york.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
do
not
it
is
necessary
for
your
honors
to
announce
what
new
york
laws
is.
new
york
law
has
been
announced
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york.
i
submit
that,
while
it
is
generally
said
that
the
law
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
also
appellate
division,
appellate
division
justices.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
that
in
this
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
do
not
say
that
you
are
bound
by
a
trial
court
judges
but
in
this
area
normally
the
appellate
divisions
are
basically
the
final
word
as
to
what
the
law
is—
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
they
have
appellate
jurisdiction
over
these
trial
court
judges
and
i
think
it
should
be
recognized
that
once
again
in
the
federal
state
hierarchy,
the
matter
of
comedy
and
federalism
on
matters
of
state
law,
the
state
courts,
i
think
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
am
not
saying,
i
think,
yes,
they
certainly
are
very,
very
persuasive,
i
would
say,
on
matters
of
state
law
as
opposed
to
constitutional
law.
i
think
they
do
bind
you
on
matters
of
state
law.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
not
a
single
--
i
would
not
say
a
single
judge
because
a
single
judge
does
not
even
bind,
say
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
of
course.
i
cite—
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
that,
while
i
am
not
acquainted
with
that
decision
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement
and
in
view
of
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
gary
thompkins
(ph).
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think,
well
it
is
rather
obvious.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
yes,
they
did
cite
court
of
appeals.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
but
i
would
also
state
if
you
look
at
those
court
of
appeals
cases
they
went
up—
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
no,
i
am
not
going
to
say
they
“misread”
them
but
also
as
judge
cardozo
said
in
zenith
case
in
new
york
court
of
appeals,
zenith
bathing
pavilion,
attachments
are
not
for
the
asking,
there
must
be
evidence,
there
must
be
proof
which
is
a
statement
of
the
general
premise.
when
an
attachment
case
got
up
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
it
was
purely
on
a
question
of
the
jurisdiction
to
grant
that
attachment
in
the
first
place
the
matter
of
law,
not
the
question
of
the
facts.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
called
a
court
of
law,
it
does
not
judge
the
facts.
the
facts
are
determined
or
can
be
modified
say
by
the
appellate
division.
but
once
that
case
gets
up
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
only
way
the
court
of
appeals
can
change
that
judgment
is
to
say
as
a
matter
of
law
on
a
very
strong
showing
that
the
law
was
applied
wrongly
below
said,
vacate
that
attachment.
indeed
i
think
it
was
wulfsohn
against
russian
republic,
they
said
this
is
going
to
be
attached,
this
attachment
is
going
to
be
vacated
because
the
russian
soviet
republic
is—
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
let
me
put
this
way,
we
have
in
this
case
a
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
has
been
declared
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
that
you
do
not
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
vacate
an
attachment
under
new
york
law.
now,
this
flowed
primarily
as
we
say
from
an
erroneous
ruling
of
new
york
law.
i
think
that
certainly
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
that
the
new
york
statute
viewed
as
a
whole
and
that
is
the
basic
test
in
this
area,
viewed
as
a
whole
is
a
constitutional
statute.
it
is
not
an
ancient
statute.
it
is
a
matter
of
the
1963
--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
would
explain
that.
i
am
not
trying
to
back
away.
because
if
the
only
ground
you
could
vacate
an
attachment
on
in
the
state
new
york
was
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
the
security
of
the
plaintiff.
that
would
mean
that
while
the
plaintiff
has
not
proven
his
grounds,
the
attachment
would
still
stand
because
it
might
be
necessary
to
secure
it
and
on
that
basis
of
course,
you
would
not
have
a
meaningful
hearing
or
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
vacate
that
attachment.
but
that
is
simply
not
the
case,
it
is
obviously
not
the
case.
we
have
a
judge
granting
the
writ
in
the
first
place.
he
is
exercising
the
discretion.
you
can
immediately
move
to
vacate
that
attachment,
you
go
once
again
back
to
a
judge
who
exercises
his
discretion
as
to
whether
that
writ
should
be
granted,
should
have
been
granted.
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
issues
on
that
motion
to
vacate
the
attachment
has
brought
us
the
issues
that
originally
came
up
on
the
ex
parte
application.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
not
necessarily
because
this
court
has
said
a
limitation
on
litigable
issues
is
not
a
denial
of
due
process.
that
was
lindsey
against
normet,
the
court
or
a
procedure
can
limit
the
number
of
issues
that
can
be
litigated
at
any
particular
time.
once
again
we
have
emphasized
that
we
have
a
statute
that
fully
comports
with
due
process.
it
is
a
necessary
statute.
i
would
also
--
one
final
point,
the
three-judge
court
made
something
about
the
fact
that
fraud
was
not
perhaps
not
as
amenable
a
proof
as
a
vendor’s
lien.
well,
assuming
this
may
be
the
case
and
by
the
way
the
appellees
in
the
amicus
curiae
seem
to
be
at
odds
at
this
issue,
on
this
issue
which
really
insufficient
reason
to
eliminate
all
pre-judgment
attachments
involving
allegations
of
fraud.
we
certainly
have
the
counter
balancing
interest
of
the
state.
and
once
again,
you
have
the
situation
where
a
judge
determines
the
issues,
he
exercises
his
discretion
and
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
make
the
brief
observation
that
certainly
my
adversary
would
have
been
making
a
fine
presentation
to
the
litigated
motion
part
of
new
york
state
supreme
court,
new
york
county
when
he
was
arguing
about
whether
there
was
fraud
in
this
case
or
whether
there
was
not
fraud
in
this
case
or
whether
the
allegations
was
sufficient
and
the
like.
i
think
though
that
we
should
recognize
that
this
is
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
it
should
be
emphasized
that
basically
this
was
a
decision
below
based
upon
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
statute
and
we
should
always
keep
that
in
mind.
now
i
have
been
informed
by
the
way,
when
there
was
a
question
of
adversary
hearings,
a
case,
i
think
it
was
a
famous
case
a
few
years
ago
called
lily
pons’
involving
the
singer
lily
pons.
and
it
was
an
adversary
hearing
on
residency,
it
was
a
jurisdictional
attachment.
for
example,
once
again,
i
think
your
honors
have
all
recognized
that
residency
is
a
factual
issue.
but
what
seems
to
be
mistaken
here
is
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
questions
of
fraud,
there
is
a
basically
a
compelling
state
interest
to
put
the
funds
into
an
effect
escrow
and
mind
you
in
new
york
under
this
attachment
the
funds
do
not
go
to
the
plaintiff,
they
are
kept
by
the
sheriff.
to
keep
these
funds
available.
this
is
i
believe
different,
generally
in
sequestration
situation.
and
there
is
in
this
compelling
necessity
to
have
a
fraud
attachment,
the
concomitant
that
at
the
very
institution
of
the
suit,
you
cannot
expect
the
plaintiff
to
prove
his
case
of
fraud
in
to-to,
there
is
no
question
to
convince
the
judge
to
sign
that
order
ex
parte
or
to
convince
him
to
deny
the
motion
to
vacate
the
attachment.
you
are
going
to
have
some
evidentiary
facts,
something
more
than
a
mere
scintilla,
something
more
than
suspicion
or
surmise.
it
definitely,
i
think
is
clear
from
the
new
york
cases
that
you
do
get
a
genuine
hearing,
it
may
be
legal,
it
may
be
factual.
and
at
this
hearing
and
i
would
say
it
is
a
real
hearing—
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think
the
most
recent
case,
i
am
not
going
to
say,
the
strongest
case,
is
of
course
the
exposition
in
regnell
against
page
which
i
put
in
as
as
appendix
to
my
brief,
that
brief
of
carey.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
the
strongest
case?
well,
i
think
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
whether
a
case
is
strong
or
weak.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
an
evidentiary
hearing
is
provided.
we
have
to
realize
that
in
the
instant
case
the
defendant,
mr.
sugar
never
moved
to
vacate
that
attachment.
you
do
not
have
before
you
anything
in
this
record
to
know
what
type
of
hearing
he
would
have
got.
he
just
skewed
the
hearing
in
the
state
court.
he
came
running
at
the
federal
court.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well
i
did
mention
of
course
the
fact,
i
think
would
describe
as,
mentioned
to
me,
the
lily
pons
case.
i
think
also
and
i
think
it
was
an
appellate
second
department.
one
of
the
cases
in
my
brief
involved
a
national
corporation
and
it
had
been
attached.
and
mind
you,
and
they
showed
the
evidence,
it
was
unnecessary,
it
was
determined,
the
attachment
was
unnecessary
for
the
security
of
the
plaintiff.
and
mind
you,
i
do
not
know
if
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
basic
point
is
that
at
the
time
of
moving
to
vacate
that
attachment
in
new
york,
you
are
not
going
to
trying
the
case.
you
are
not
going
to
be
trying
the
question
of,
as
a
matter
of
law,
was
there
fraud?
you
will
simply
try
determining
whether
that
judgment,
ex
parte,
not
judgment,
ex
parte
writ
was
issued
properly
the--
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
i
think,
i
cannot
off
hand
state
what
case
and
i
think
that
is
important.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
justice
marshall,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
were
not
issues
in
the
state
of
new
york
until
this
three-judge
court
opinion
and
judgment
came
down.
it
was
not
considered
a
problem
in
the
state
of
new
york
as
to
what
happened
here
or
what
happened
there.
oh,
excuse
me,
i
have
been
pointed
to
the
case
of
(inaudible)
which
discusses
about
the
standards
of
fraudulent
intent.
mr.
a.
seth
greenwald
i
think
that
was
on
page
30,
26
of
the
curtis
brief.
thank
you.
