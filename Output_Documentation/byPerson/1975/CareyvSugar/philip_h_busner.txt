mr.
philip
h.
busner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
a
state
can
devise
pre-judgment
seizure
remedies
to
protect
its
citizens
against
fraud
which
will
comport
with
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
it
comes
to
this
court
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three
court
judgment
by
a
three
court
judge
panel
that
was
convened
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
whose
judgment
held
unconstitutional.
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
new
york
attachment
statute,
the
grounds
of
which
are
based
upon
fraudulent
activity
by
a
defendant.
the
provisions
have
found
at
sub-sections
4,
5
and
8
of
section
6201
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
law
and
rules.
sub-division
4
provides
that
a
judge
in
his
discretion
upon
a
prima-facie
showing
by
evidentiary
facts
that
a
defendant
with
intent
to
defraud
his
creditors
has
assigned,
disposed
up,
or
secreted
his
assets
or
that
he
is
about
to
do
the
same.
sub-division
5
permits
a
judge
in
his
discretion
to
issue
such
an
order
upon
a
prima-facie
demonstration
that
the
plaintiff
has
a
cause
of
action
in
contract,
and
secondly
that
the
defendant
has
committed
a
fraud
at
the
inception
of
that
contract.
sub-division
8
permits
the
judge
in
his
discretion
to
issue
such
an
order
upon
a
demonstration,
prima-facie
by
the
plaintiff
that
he
has
a
cause
of
action
for
either
fraud
or
deceit.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
as
a
model,
if
i
briefly
stated
the
facts
which
underlay
the
attachment
in
this
action
and
which
led
to
the
commencements
of
the
action
in
the
lower
court.
the
appellant,
curtis
circulation
company,
a
national
distributor
of
magazines
enfident
to
a
written
agreement
with
bert
randolph
sugar,
a
publisher
of
sports
magazines,
and
a
corporation
which
he
then
called
champion
sports.
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement
curtis
agreed
to
make
advances
to
the
champion
based
upon
estimates
f
sales
of
the
magazines.
and
the
agreement
provided
that
in
the
event
that
the
payments
they
made
were
excessive
because
the
estimates
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
they
would
have
a
right
to
recoup
those
over
payments
from
subsequent
additions
of
the
magazines
that
were
covered
by
this
agreement.
at
the
time
the
contract
was
entered
into,
sugar
represented
to
curtis
that
he
control
the
champion,
and
champion
was
the
owner
of
the
magazines.
after
it
had
been
in
effect
for
some
18
months
and
at
a
time
when
substantial
monies
were
due
to
curtis
by
champion
and
the
contract
still
had
three-and-a-half
years
to
run,
curtis
discovered
that
sugar
has
stripped
champion
of
all
of
its
assets
and
had
arranged
to
sell
all
of
its
magazines
to
two
purchasers.
it
learned
that
the
seller
under
the
two
purchase
agreements
was
not
champion,
with
respect
to
whom
sugar
represented,
it
was
the
owner
of
the
magazine,
but
another
corporation
called
wrestling
revue,
over
which
sugar
also
had
control.
and
it
also
learned
that
all
the
consideration
payable
under
these
two
agreements
of
sale
were
payable
by
the
purchasers
to
wrestling
and
not
the
champion.
it
learned
that
sugar
had
represented
to
the
purchasers
that
wrestling
was
always
the
owner
of
the
magazines
that
champion,
although
the
ostensible
owner
was
just
publishing
these
magazines
under
an
alleged
license
agreement
with
the
wrestling
that
it
had
failed
pay
to
its
license
fees,
hence
wrestling
revoked
the
license
and
now
is
in
the
position
to
come
to
these
purchasers
and
sell
all
of
these
magazines,
free
of
any
obligation
under
the
curtis
distribution
agreement.
based
upon
those
facts,
curtis
determined
that
it
must
have
defraud
that
the
inception
of
the
contract
when
sugar
said
that
champion
was
the
owner
of
the
magazines.
or
that
sugar
had
defrauded
it
after
the
contract
and
stripped
champion
of
its
assets
like
by
concocting
this
alleged
license
agreement
and
the
purported
ownership
by
wrestling.
accordingly,
that
the
term
that
had
to
act
promptly
to
arrest
the
further
flow
of
those
assets
in
the
hands
or
places
where
it
would
not
be
able
to
satisfy
its
right
to
recoup
or
its
right
to
damages
for
fraud.
the
contract
still
having
a
three-and
-half
years
to
run
and
they
having
lost
their
opportunity
to
distribute
those
magazines.
curtis
supplied
ex
parte
pursuant
to
section
6211
of
the
new
york
statute
for
an
order
of
attachment.
in
support
of
that
application
as
the
statute
requires,
it
submitted
this
one
affidavit
of
its
secretary
which
contained
evidentiary
facts.
the
facts
largely
but
in
greater
detail
than
those
that
i
just
described
your
honors.
and
next
to
the
affidavit
was
to
verify
complaint
in
the
action,
a
copy
of
the
distribution
agreement
and
a
detailed
statement
of
the
account
between
curtis
and
champion,
showing
the
monies
then
do
an
owing
to
curtis.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
the
gravament
of
the
complaint
was
largely
the
same,
but
the
complaint
was
broader
and
less
detailed
and
did
not
go
into
the
evidentiary
facts
to
the
same
extent,
the
affidavit
did.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
that
is
correct.
the
statute
talks
about
commencing
an
action
at
the
time
you
ask
for
a
provisional
remedy.
in
this
case
would
be
attachment.
although
i
do
want
make
it
plain,
you
do
not
have
to
serve
the
compliant
to
other
papers
in
advanced,
it
is
an
ex
parte
application.
the
statute
does
require
you
to
serve
the
complaint
on
24
hours
notice,
when
it
is
demanded
and
beyond
60
days.
that
length
of
period
being
designed
primarily
for
interim
jurisdiction
where
the
defendant
might
be
out
of
state
and
might
take
quite
a
while
to
serve
and
possibly
require
an
order
of
publication
and
so
forth.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes,
they
do,
mr.
justice.
we
moved
under
all
four
sections
and
the
order
was
granted
under
all
four
sections.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
the
first
one
is
fraudulent
secretion
of
assets.
five
is
the
contract
action
fraud
in
the
inception
of
the
contract.
and
eight
is
simply
an
action
in
fraud
and
decei.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
you
mean
a
finding
by
a
court
or
what
curtis
learned?
no,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
below
and
there
has
been
no
such
finding
by
a
court,
certainly
not
in
a
federal
court
and
its
now
on
the
ready
calendar
of
the
state
court.
we
just
do
not
have
a
record
on
that
right
now,
mr.
judge.
with
respect
to
the
grounds
upon
which
the
lower
court
relied
for
its
decision,
it
really
relied
entirely
upon
three
distinctions
which
it
perceived
this
case
had
from
this
courts
decision
in
mitchell
against
w.
t.
grant.
it
held
first,
if
i
can
paraphrase
it,
that
although
it
recognize
the
defendants
and
the
state
of
new
york
had
a
right
to
immediately
move
to
vacate
the
attachment.
one
of
the
matters
discussed
at
length
in
mitchell,
this
court
found
that
under
new
york
law,
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
preliminary
hearing
was
on
the
defendant
and
they
held
that
did
not
comport
with
due
process.
secondly,
reading
mitchell
most
narrowly,
the
court
seem
to
require
as
a
sine
qua
none
of
any
prejudgment
seizure
that
the
plaintiff
have
a
prior
vendors
lien
or
statutory
lien
in
the
property
which
he
sought
to
attach.
finally,
related
to
the
second
ground
but
somewhat
different
was
the
court's
finding
that
allegations
of
fraud,
are
not
immutable
to
pass
a
proof
on
a
preliminary
hearing.
as
i
read
the
court's
decision,
that
being
the
case,
there
really,
if
one
follows
that
to
his
logical
conclusion,
you
just
cannot
get
a
prejudgment
seizure
based
on
fraud
that
will
comport
with
due
process.
because
the
lower
courts
certainly
wrote
in
view
of
the
decision
in
mitchell
which
incidentally
was
decided
after
the
complaint
was
originally
filed
but
before
the
three
judges
convened
to
hear
and
determine
the
action,
mitchell,
as
i
read
it,
certainly
does
not
place
the
emphasis
on
whether
the
writ
is
issued
in
the
first
instance,
ex
parte
or
whether
its
done
have
to
notice,
the
emphasis
there
is
the
preliminary
hearing.
i
think
the
lower
court
correctly
followed
that
concept
but
in
holding
from
its
reading
of
mitchell
that
fraud
could
not
be
easily
proved
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
therefore
fraud
could
never
be
the
basis
for
an
attachment.
i
think
is
extraordinary
preposition
on
space.
the
courts
seemed
to
go
equally
as
flaw
with
respect
to
the
vendors
lien.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
intended
in
mitchell
that
absent
to
vendors
lien
or
statutory
lien,
a
plaintiff
could
not
under
any
circumstances
gets
a
prejudgment
seizure.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
if
i
understand
your
question
absolutely
no
hearing
between
the
ex
parte
taking
and
plenary
trial.
my
understanding
of
your
decision
in
mitchell,
mr.
justice
white
and,
i
am
sorry,
you
wrote
it
but
the
it
is
court's
decision
and
also
courtâ€™s
decision
in
north
georgia
against
di-chem
would
indicate
that
may,
that
i
could
not
successfully
make
that
argument.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
there
has
to
be
some
opportunity
before
the
plenary
trial.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
for
the
defendant
to
come
in
and
at
least
get
the
judges
here
to
test
what
the
plaintiff
has
told
the
judge.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes.
but
to
a
very
limited
extent.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
that
is
correct.
i
think
to
be
fair
under
the
--
yes
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood
what
you
were
asking
me
before.
do
you
mean
the
so-called
unnecessary
security
test
that
the
court
applied
below
when
you
talk
about
the
danger
of
--
mr.
philip
h.
busner
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do.
but
i
will
--
thank
you.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
i
would
like
to
correct
that
impression
i
may
have
left
by
virtue
of
a
question
asked
to
me
of
mr.
justice
blackmun
earlier
in
the
argument.
the
question
was
asked
whether
there
was
a
finding
in
this
case
that
there
had
been
secretion
of
assets.
i
took
the
question
to
mean
whether
there
had
been
final
determination
or
a
judgment,
of
course
there
was
a
finding
by
judge
who
signed
the
order
of
attachment
based
upon
the
allegations
and
proofs
submitted
to
him
on
the
ex
parte
application.
with
respect
to
your
question
that
mr.
justice
white
left
with
me
at
the
adjournment,
i
am
not
sure
what
the
question
was
but
i
believe
you
were
referring
to
the
ground
on
the
new
york
statute
which
permits
the
defendant
to
move
to
vacate
the
attachment
upon
a
showing
that
the
security
is
unnecessary
to
the
plaintiff.
were
you
referring
to
that
mr.
justice?
mr.
philip
h.
busner
as
i
read
mitchell
and
the
north
georgia
against
di-chem,
if
that
were
the
case,
if
the
defendant
were
restricted
to
the
question
whether
the
security
was
necessary,
i
think
the
law
would
be
unconstitutional
butâ€”
mr.
philip
h.
busner
absolutely
and
it
is
clear
from
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
reports.
it
is
clear
from
all
of
the
decisions
that
have
preceded
the
three-judge
decision
on
that
subject
including
most
of
the
decisions
cited
by
the
three-judge
court.
and
since
the
decisions
of
the
three-judge
court,
there
have
been
at
least
a
half-a-dozen
perhapsâ€”
mr.
philip
h.
busner
quite
obviously,
and
mostly
egregious
--
mr.
philip
h.
busner
i
think
that
would
have
to
follow
from
mitchell
and
di-chem
because
i
think
that
those
cases
do
require
some
sort
of
opportunity
for
the
defendants
to
immediately
go
to
the
judge
and
point
out
any
improprieties
that
exist
in
the
papers
upon
the
initial
application.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes.
the
motion
was
made
on
that
ground
mr.
justice
white.
before
the
three
judges
were
convened
to
hear
and
determine,
we
made
that
motion
to
judge
laska
who
had
originally
had
the
case
and
he
rejected
that
ground
andâ€”
mr.
philip
h.
busner
both.
we
asked
the
court
to
abstain
and
to
dismiss
and
to
give
the
state
court
an
opportunity
to
test
the
validity
of
the
attachment
or
the
intent
of
defendant
here
to
raise
the
constitutional
objection
the
state
court
to
do
it
there.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
except,
there
was
one
appellate
division
second
department
case
that
cited
that
refused
to
follow
the
three-judge
court
as
did
a
number
of
other
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
with
that
case,
i
just
do
not
have
any
knowledge
whether
that
case
has
been
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
because
i
think
the
law
was
clear
on
that
point
these
--
mr.
philip
h.
busner
that
is
correct
but
there
is
absolutely
no
authority
that
they
cited.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes.
but
i
think
my
disagreement
is
more
than
a
simple
advocacy
on
my
own
part.
it
is
quite
obvious
from
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
is
quite
obvious
from
the
circumstance
that
the
very
decisions
that
they
cited
except
for
two
or
three
were
all
decided
upon
grounds
other
than
the
unnecessary
security
test.
the
lower
court
for
instance
said
that
they
were
interpreting
cases;
the
statement
was
that
theses
cases
for
50
years
had
so
construed
the
statute.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
unnecessary
security
test
was
only
added
to
the
statute
in
1963,
when
our
civil
practice
law
and
rules
superseded
the
prior
state
practice
statute
which
was
known
as
the
civil
practice
act.
without
that
provision
at
all,
it
has
always
been
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
reasonable
argument
about
it.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
i
think
this
is
so
obvious
mr.
justice
if
you
will
forgive
i
just
have
to
sayâ€”
mr.
philip
h.
busner
if
that
so,
i
think
this
the
classic
case.
it
is
most
obvious
in
this
case
from
the
legislative
reports
and
from
all
of
the
decisions
not
only
the
decisions
which
followed
the
lower
court
decision.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
i
would
not
be
at
all
surprised
mr.
justice
white.
the
point
was
never
raised
by
my
opponent
in
his
briefs
to
the
three-judge
court.
where
they
got
it
from
is
just
beyond
me.
it
is
that
obviously
bad
my
opinion.
based
on
that
basic
misapprehension
by
the
three-judge
court,
they
also
came
to
the
conclusion
which
really
formed
the
main
grounds
of
their
decision
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
upon
the
defendant
in
new
york
upon
the
motions
to
vacate.
numerous
new
york
decisions
have
stated
quite
clearly
that
the
burden
of
proof
remains
upon
the
plaintiff
beyond
his
original
applications
and
upon
the
motion
to
vacate.
it
is
true
other
decisions
have
stated
that
upon
the
motion
to
vacate
the
defendant
carries
the
burden.
but
i
submit
when
you
view
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
those
cases
really
stand
for
no
more
than
the
proposition
that
the
plaintiff
already
having
submitted
his
proofs
and
his
evidentiary
facts,
showing
his
prima-facie
case
now
comes
the
defendant
when
he
makes
his
motion,
its
incumbent
upon
him
to
test
or
try
to
rebut
that
prima-facie
showing.
and
i
think
that
procedure
in
new
york
obviously
comports
with
due
process.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes.
once
we
make
--
mr.
philip
h.
busner
unless
the
issue
is
extremely
narrow
such
as
on
a
general
release
or
if
the
defendant
was
supposed
to
be
somewhere
that
he
can
demonstrate
he
was
not
there
or
some
issue
like
that
upon
which
he
can
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
cplr
2218
which
is
the
general
section
covering
motions,
except
for
that
quite
frankly,
if
all
he
is
going
to
do
is
raise
issues
of
fact
or
defenses,
he
will
not
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
all
probability
in
new
york.
i
do
not
think
it
is
otherwise
in
louisiana.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
no.
i
think
we
would
go
through
the
procedure
of
using
live
witnesses
and
the
same
documents
on
an
oral
hearing.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
that
is
correct.
i
misunderstood
your
last
question
mr.
justice?
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes
i
do.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
as
a
matter
of
comporting
with
due
process
whether
that
is
a
necessity,
no,
i
do
not,
i
think
the
new
york
procedure
comports
with
due
process
without
offering
that
evidentiary
hearing
in
every
case.
i
conceive
of
certain
case
where
the
judge
would
order
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
in
most
cases
i
can
not
build
specific
models
but
should
think
if
the
defendant
came
forward
with
some
compelling
evidence
which
would
demonstrate
that
the
plaintiffâ€™s
initial
showing
was
not
correct
or
created
a
substantial
doubt
with
respect
to
that,
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
come
forward
and
that
often
happens
on
these
motion
in
state
courts.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
that
is
true
in
new
york.
the
opportunitiesâ€”
mr.
philip
h.
busner
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
h.
busner
correct,
you
do
not
have
the
opportunity
in
new
york,
i
suggest
anymore
than
louisiana
to
have
a
plenary
trial
of
the
underlying
controversies.
and
i
believe
mitchell
was
clear
on
that
point
that
a
plenary
trial
resolving
the
merits
of
the
controversy
between
the
parties
is
just
not
necessary
before
property
is
taken
that
the
issues
can
be
narrow.
thank
you.
