we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-18,
fisher
against
the
united
states
and
611,
united
states
against
kasmir
and
others.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.

what
if
the
counterfeiter
turns
the
illegal
plates
over
to
his
lawyer
or
a
murderer
turns
the
murder
weapon
over
to
his
lawyer,
did
you
--
does
that
find
that
answer
lurking
in
anything
you
have
said
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
you
will
go
back
to
boyd
where
the
language
quoted
the
english
judge
and
described
papers
as
man?s
dearest
possession
and
you
say
that
would
not
necessarily
apply
to
counterfeit
plates?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
say
it
is
a
deposit
box,
something
of
a
sanctuary
too,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
say
for
the
man?s
own
home,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
sanctuary
does
not
really
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
(voice
overlap)
another
person,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
goodfriend.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
conceivably
--
conceivably
some
clients
might
not
want
that
ownership
because
of
the
burdens
that
would
carry
with
it,
is
not
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
merely
suggesting
that
that
might
be
the
attitude
of
the
client?
he
does
not
want
responsibility
for
how
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
accountant?s
arrives
at
his
conclusions
because
he
wants
to
use
as
a
shield,
the
fact
that
the
accountant
has
taken
the
responsibility,
which
conceivably
in
many
instances
might
shelter
him
from
criminal
liability,
by
reason
the
lack
of
intent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
just
addressing
myself
to
your
suggestion
that
this
could
be
avoided
very
easily
by
these
contractual
arrangements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
not
quite
that
simple
perhaps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
have
followed
you.
were
--
were
you
suggesting
that
the
ownership
should
dominate
over
everything
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
would
put
the
emphasis
on
the
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
were
--
what
if
the
papers
were
stolen
from
the
attorney
or
by
a
faithless
secretary
to
the
lawyer
and
given
to
the
treasury
agent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
would
be
so
bad
about
doing
away
with
the
fifth
amendment
as
applied
to
documents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
goodfriend,
i
think
you
may
be
getting
into
your
colleague's
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bazelon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
subpoenaed
the
original
records
from
the
english
quarters,
judge
friendly
suggested
they
could
do
that,
could
not
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinions
in
74-18,
fisher
against
the
united
states
and
in
74-611,
united
states
against
kasmir
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.

you,
