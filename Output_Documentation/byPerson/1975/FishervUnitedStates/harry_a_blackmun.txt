justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
say
that,
mr.
wallace?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
suppose
--
well,
suppose
it
was
a
diary
of
the
taxpayer,
in
which
he
recorded
all
his
gambling
and
other
illegal
transactions,
and
that
is
what
it
was
from
which
the
accountant
worked
on
his
yellow
pad?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
matter
how
incriminating
the
taxpayer?s
own
document
maybe?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
as
if
he
has
written
a
letter
or
the
accountant
(inaudible)
called
him
on
telephone?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
regard
it
as
any
different
because
the
letter
was
written
to
the
lawyer,
or
the
diary
was
given
to
the
lawyer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
just
get
back
to
that
question
for
a
moment
mr.
wallace?
i
take
it
if
this
communication
were
addressed
directly
to
the
lawyer,
not
to
the
accountant
and
turned
over
by
the
accountant
to
the
lawyer,
you
might
have
a
different
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bazelon,
would
your
case
be
any
stronger
if
a
taxpayer
had
gone
to
a
lawyer
and
then
these
were
the
work
papers
of
the
lawyer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
except
that
a
lawyer
practices
law
and
an
accountant
sometimes
practices
law?
