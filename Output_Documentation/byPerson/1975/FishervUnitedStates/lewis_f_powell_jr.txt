justice

f.
powell,

wallace,
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
only
records
involved
were
taxpayer?s
records.
for
example
his
checkbook,
let
us
assume
we
are
dealing
with
a
checkbook
only,
the
stubs
and
canceled
checks
and
they
were
turned
over
to
the
accountant
and
they
were
the
subject
of
the
subpoena,
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
accountant,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
accountant
has
done
nothing,
but
tabulated
statistical
data,
without
any
analysis,
so
that
the
accountant?s
yellow
pad
notes
for
example
are
nothing
more
than
an
addition
perhaps
of
check
stubs,
would
the
mere
transposition
from
the
taxpayer?s
document
to
the
yellow
pad
of
the
accountant
be
controlling

without
any
analysis
of
creative
work
by
the
tax
--
by
the
accountant?
