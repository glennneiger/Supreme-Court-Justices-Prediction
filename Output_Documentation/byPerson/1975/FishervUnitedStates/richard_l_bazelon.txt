mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
the
petitioners
in
74-18
c
is
whether
the
taxpayer
has
a
fifth
amendment
right
with
respect
to
documents
which
are
properly
in
his
possession,
in
a
purely
personal
capacity,
prepared
at
his
personal
direction
for
his
personal
use,
based
entirely
on
personal
records
supplied
by
him.
the
record
in
our
case
makes
very
clear
what
the
nature
of
the
documents
sought
by
the
government
is.
they
are
simply
summaries
of
canceled
checks
and
deposit
receipts
of
the
taxpayer.
the
accountant
in
preparing
this
record
has
simply
transcribed
information
from
the
canceled
checks
and
deposit
receipts
in
no
different
way
than
a
scribner
would
transcribe
information
from
documents
that
are
given
to
him.
we
submit
that
when
a
citizen
makes
available
to
a
third
party,
personal
information
and
that
third
party
merely
transcribes
that
information,
and
the
document
containing
that
transcript
is
given
back
to
the
citizen
and
the
citizen
can
assert
a
fifth
amendment
protection
if
the
production
of
that
document
will
incriminate
him.
we
believe
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
compelling
and
fall
squarely
within
the
fifth
amendment
protection.
the
government
argues
in
this
case
that
solely
because
the
taxpayer
made
a
revelation
to
a
third
party
of
highly
personal
material,
that
he
in
some
way
forfeited
his
fifth
amendment
protection.
we
can
see
no
justification
in
the
fifth
amendment
for
such
a
position.
the
compelled
production
by
the
taxpayer
is
no
less
self-incriminating
and
the
information
is
no
less
personal,
of
no
less
a
personal
nature
because
of
this
disclosure
to
a
third
party.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
your
honor,
they
are
not
like
a
diary.
they
are
personal
in
a
sense
that
they
reflect
the
financial
transactions
and
financial
business
of
the
citizen
involved
and
this
court
has
stated
in
the
bellis
case
for
example
that
the
records
of
a
sole
proprietor,
business
records,
fall
within
the
fifth
amendment
protection.
certainly,
we
would
say
that
a
fortiori
the
records
based
on
canceled
checks
and
deposit
receipts
would
also
fall
within
the
fifth
amendment
protection.
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
with
respect
to
the
revelation
of
this
information
to
an
accountant
that
we
believe
it
is
particularly
inappropriate
in
this
situation
to
hold
that
this
works
a
forfeiture
of
the
fifth
amendment
protection.
in
pennsylvania
for
example,
there
is
a
state
statute,
63
pennsylvania
statute
annotated
section
9.11
a,
which
creates
an
attorney-client
privilege.
the
record
of
our
case
makes
clear
that
these
documents,
the
analysis
of
receipts
and
disbursements,
were
held
by
the
accountant
only
for
a
limited
time
in
any
event,
and
after
a
period
of
several
years
they
were
regularly
returned
to
the
taxpayer.
this
was
the
twenty-five
year
history
of
the
accountant-taxpayer
relationship.
the
accountant
further
made
clear
and
testified
that
he
was
holding
these
papers
for
a
temporary
period
solely
as
a
matter
of
convenience
and
it
was
holding
them
at
the
request
of
the
taxpayer
as
the
taxpayer
wanted
them.
we
also
believe
that
the
reason
for
the
taxpayer
going
to
the
accountant,
argue
strongly
against
working
a
forfeiture
of
the
taxpayer?s
fifth
amendment
right.
it
is
precisely
because
the
tax
laws
in
this
country
make
it
mandatory
or
necessary
for
many
taxpayers
to
seek
third
party
assistance,
that
a
taxpayer
goes
to
a
third
party.
it
is
in
the
taxpayer?s
interest
and
we
submit
it
is
in
the
government?s
interest
that
the
taxpayers
avail
themselves
of
assistance
of
qualified
third
parties,
as
the
taxpayers
did
in
these
cases
going
to
certified
public
accountants
and
to
hold
the
taxpayers
who
do
seek
this
assistance
which
is
important
to
them
and
to
the
government,
thereby
forfeit
a
fifth
amendment
right,
we
believe
is
very
inappropriate
to
the
policies
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
if
the
lawyer
was
serving,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
same
function
that
the
accountant
was
serving
in
this
case,
then
i
do
not
see
why
the
case
should
be
any
stronger
if
the
lawyer
performs
that
work.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
[laughter]
a
comparison
to
the
boyd
case
further
substantiates
our
position.
the
document
which
the
claimant
in
boyd
was
protected
against
producing
was
an
invoice
produced
by
--
given
to
him
by
a
third
party.
certainly,
that
invoice
did
not
concern
the
personal
affair
of
the
claimant
to
anywhere
near
the
same
extent
as
the
records
in
this
case
concern
personal
affairs
of
the
taxpayer.
and
those
records
were
not
nearly
as
personal
in
terms
of
their
history,
as
the
records
in
this
case
--
in
these
cases.
the
government,
we
believe
in
their
brief
and
in
their
argument
to
this
court
in
the
couch
case,
has
conceded
that
if
this
accountant
had
been
an
employee
of
the
taxpayer
or
even
he
were
serving
as
an
independent
contractor,
but
did
his
work
at
the
offices
of
the
taxpayer
and
left
his
records
at
the
offices
of
the
taxpayer,
that
the
taxpayer
could
claim
a
fifth
amendment
protection
with
respect
to
these
records.
we
cannot
perceive
any
policy
of
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
advanced,
by
making
the
status
and
the
work
conditions
of
the
accountants
determinative
of
the
applicability
of
a
fifth
amendment
privilege.
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
opinions
of
this
court,
the
act
of
producing
a
document
which
entails
in
it
a
representation
that
the
documents
produced
are
those
documents
described
in
the
summons
is
a
testimonial
act.
we
submit
that
the
act
of
production
of
a
testimonial
source
is
testimonial
in
an
additional
sense
as
well,
in
that
it
constitutes
a
publication
of
the
information,
which
is
contained
in
the
document.
the
government
says
that
unless
the
particular
communication
--
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
well,
your
honor,
a
search
warrant
does
not
require
any
compulsion
on
the
person
of
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
yes
it
is,
mr.
justice
white,
but
not
by
the
person
who
is
claiming
the
protection
with
respect
--
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
i
am
suggesting
that
whether
--
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
--
whether
to
could
or
not
would
not
justify
the
government
in
obtaining
these
documents
in
a
way
that
places
the
taxpayer
in
a
position
where
he
has
to
incriminate
himself.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
that
is
right.
the
government
has
argued
that
unless
the
actual
testimonial
content
of
the
act
of
production
is
incriminatory
in
and
of
itself,
there
could
be
no
satisfying
of
the
criteria
of
a
testimonial
act,
and
we
submit
this
is
just
not
what
the
law
has
been.
this
court
as
recently
as
in
the
case
of
maness
versus
meyers
has
held,
that
where
there
is
a
compelled
testimonial
response
which
is
part
of
the
link
of
the
evidence
against
the
accused,
that
the
accused
is
entitled
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment
protection,
the
actual
response
of
a
taxpayer
need
not
be
the
kind
of
incriminatory
evidence
that
would
be
admissible
at
the
trial,
if
it
is
part
of
the
link
and
the
chain
of
evidence
against
him.
and
clearly
in
this
case,
the
taxpayer
in
producing
the
documents
is
saying,
these
are
the
analysis
of
receipts
and
disbursements.
and
we
would
even
go
further
and
say
that
the
taxpayers'
implied
testimony
in
doing
that
amounts
to
an
authentication
because
the
history
in
this
case
is
that
the
taxpayer
had
regularly
received
these
documents
over
twenty-five
year
period
from
the
accountant,
that
is
these
analysis
of
receipts
and
disbursements,
he
was
familiar
therefore
with
the
accountant?s
work
product
and
under
the
law
of
evidence
in
terms
of
witnesses
who
can
testify
to
authentication,
he
was
in
a
position
to
authenticate
those
documents.
he
was
familiar
with
the
accountant?s
work
product.
he
had
seen
it
in
circumstances
which
would
indicate
the
genuineness
of
the
past
documents.
he
could
be
a
witness
to
authenticate
those
documents.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
the
incriminatory
link
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
providing
the
government
with
the
information
that
the
papers
produced
by
the
taxpayer
are
indeed
the
records
transcribed
from
his
own
records
by
the
accountant.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
it
becomes
part
of
the
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
against
the
taxpayer.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
because
it
allows,
it
is
--
it
is
a
statement
that
these
are
the
documents
that
permits
the
government
--
that
is
incriminatory
because
it
gets
the
government
to
the
next
stage
in
the
possession
of
evidence
against
the
accused,
namely
to
go
to
the
accountant
and
have
the
accountant
come
in
and
testify.
now,
the
fact
that
the
accountant
may
be
able
to
give
much
the
same
testimony
in
terms
of
identifying
these
documents
does
not
make
the
taxpayers
own
admission
any
less
incriminatory
as
to
him.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
we
would
have
a
different
case,
no
question
about
it,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
they
would
raise
the
separate
question
of
whether
or
not
part
of
a
testimonial
act
is
producing
a
testimonial
source,
in
fact
publishing
it.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
well,
that
is
always,
that
is
always
a
--
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
no,
no,
well,
if
that
element
is
involved
that
is
a
separate
item
of
testimony
and
on
that
score
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
part
of
the
second
circuit?s
opinion
in
the
beattie
case.
we
believe
that
the
boyd
case
fully
supports
the
position
we
are
taking
with
respect
to
the
act
of
production
being
a
testimonial
response
by
the
taxpayer.
after
all
those
were
third
party
documents
and
the
taxpayer
by
producing
them
were
saying,
this
is
the
invoice
and
the
government
wanted
that
invoice
to
establish
how
much
glass
there
was
in
the
twenty-eight
or
whatever
number
of
quadrants
have
been
imported.
they
wanted
the
invoice
for
the
truth
of
the
averments
in
the
invoice.
the
second
circuit
said
with
respect
to
the
boyd
case,
that
the
invoice
had
significance
in
establishing
that
the
claimant
had
received
the
invoice,
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
court?s
opinion
in
the
boyd
case
that
indicates
that
there
was
any
relevance
whatsoever
to
the
fact
that
the
claimant
had
received
the
invoice
and
in
fact
the
court?s
opinion
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
court
said,
on
the
trail
of
the
cause
it
became
important
to
show
the
quantity
and
value
of
a
glass
contained
in
the
twenty-nine
cases
previously
imported.
the
only
significance
of
that
invoice
was
for
the
truth
of
the
statements
contained
therein.
therefore,
the
production
of
the
invoice
in
boyd
was
testimonial
in
exactly
the
same
way
the
production
of
the
documents
in
this
case
would
be
testimonial.
mr.
richard
l.
bazelon
they
certainly
could,
and
there
would
be
no
act
of
compulsion
on
the
claimant
in
that
case.
thank
you.
