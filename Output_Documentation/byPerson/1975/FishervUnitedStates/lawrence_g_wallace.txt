mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
present
a
factual
variation
on
this
court?s
decision
three
terms
ago
in
couch
against
the
united
states.
couch
involved
enforcement
of
an
internal
revenue
summons,
seeking
to
secure
a
taxpayer?s
records
in
the
possession
of
her
accountant.
here,
by
contrast,
we
are
concerned
in
both
cases
with
the
accountant?s
own
records,
reflecting
his
work
product
in
preparing
tax
returns
for
the
taxpayers.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
records
were
in
the
accountant?s
possession
when
the
internal
revenue
service
special
agents
first
indicated
to
the
taxpayers
that
they
wish
to
investigate
their
tax
returns.
in
each
instance
they
have
been
accountant?s
possession
for
at
least
several
years,
and
in
one
case
dating
back
to
1959
and
it
was
in
both
cases,
only
after
the
initial
investigative
contact
between
the
agents
and
the
taxpayers,
that
the
taxpayers
hired
the
attorneys
who
now
have
possession
of
the
records,
and
the
accountants
were
requested
to
deliver
the
records
to
the
taxpayers
who
then
handed
them
over
to
their
attorneys.
in
one
instance,
within
about
five
minutes
and
in
the
other
instance
in
twelve
days.
the
internal
revenue
summonses
were
issued
shortly
thereafter
to
the
accountants
and
the
attorneys
requesting
the
records
and
the
testimony
of
the
accountants
about
the
records.
there
are
slight
differences
in
the
records
involved
in
the
summonses
in
the
two
cases,
but
in
both
instances,
they
are
records
from
the
accountant?s
files,
working
for
the
taxpayer
in
helping
to
prepare
his
income
tax
returns
and
compiling
other
financial
information
for
him.
upon
refusal
of
the
accountants
and
the
attorneys
to
comply
with
the
summons,
these
enforcement
proceedings
were
brought,
and
in
each
case,
the
fifth
amendment
privileged
against
self-incrimination
was
asserted
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayers.
in
the
third
circuit
case,
fisher,
the
taxpayers
intervened
to
assert
the
privileges
for
themselves.
in
the
fifth
circuit
case,
kasmir,
the
taxpayer?s
attorneys
sought
to
assert
it
on
their
behalf.
both
district
courts
found
that
the
records
were
still
owned
by
the
accountants
and
rejected
the
claim
of
fifth
amendment
privilege
on
the
merits,
and
ordered
enforcement
of
the
summons.
the
district
court
in
the
fisher
case
summarized
it
findings
on
page
a7
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
as
follows.
the
facts
in
the
instant
case
as
presented
before
this
court,
demonstrate
that
the
papers
were
and
are
the
property
of
the
accountant.
they
only
left
his
possession
after
the
taxpayer
learned
of
the
investigation.
the
transfer
of
the
papers
seems
to
indicate
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
thwart
to
government?s
investigation.
and
much
the
same
could
of
be
said
of
actual
situation
in
kasmir,
where
the
time
span
was
even
shorter
between
the
call
of
the
special
agent
and
the
transfer
of
the
papers
to
the
taxpayer
and
then
on
to
the
attorney.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
sitting
en
banc
affirmed
the
enforcement
order
with
one
judge
dissenting.
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
enforcement
order
in
that
case,
again,
with
one
judge
dissenting.
our
starting
point
in
analyzing
the
problem
here
is
that
these
materials
sought
in
the
summonses
would
not
be
subject
to
a
claim
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
while
in
the
accountant?s
possession.
this
follows
a
fortiori
from
the
holding
in
couch,
which
held
that
even
papers
belonging
to
the
taxpayer
would
not
be
subject
to
a
claim
of
the
privilege
while
in
the
non-transitory
possession
of
the
accountant,
and
it
also
follows
from
this
court?s
opinion
in
california
ers
and
other
cases,
holding
that
there
is
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
with
respect
to
third
party
records
as
production
is
sought
from
third
persons.
and
so
the
question
becomes
whether
they
are
transferred
to
the
taxpayer
in
these
circumstances,
created
a
right
to
resist
their
production
on
the
ground
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
where
that
right
otherwise
would
not
have
existed
and
there
is
a
further
question,
which
i
think
is
a
less
substantial
one,
of
whether
the
subsequent
transfer
to
the
attorney
affected
the
right
in
any
way.
in
the
only
other
post
couch
case
dealing
with
this
question,
the
transfer
was
handled
the
other
way
and
that
is
in
the
beattie
case,
which
we
have
reproduced
with
the
convenience
of
the
court
and
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
in
the
kasmir
case.
that
is
a
second
circuit
decision,
dealing
with
an
almost
identical
factual
situation,
except
that
there
they
decided
to
have
the
records
transferred
from
the
accountant
through
the
attorney
to
the
taxpayer
and
the
taxpayer
now
has
the
them
in
his
possession,
rather
than
the
other
way
around,
but
basically
the
same
issues
are
involved.
now,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
beattie
were
correct
in
rejecting
the
claim
of
privilege
here,
based
on
really
two
lines
of
cases
supporting
their
view.
the
first
are
the
cases
dealing
with
what
are
essentially
third
party
records,
in
the
possession
of
the
claimant
of
the
privilege.
those
cases
have
in
the
past
involved
largely
organizational
records,
such
as
corporate
records,
labor
union
records,
partnership
records
in
the
most
recent
case.
the
line
of
authority
starts
with
wilson
against
the
united
states
and
goes
through
wheeler,
grant,
white
and
finally
bellis,
a
recent
decision
of
the
court,
and
we
have
developed
those
cases
in
our
brief.
in
essence,
they
hold
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
being
an
intimate
and
personal
right,
maybe
applied
only
to
one?s
own
personal
papers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
in
resisting
a
subpoena
to
produce
the
papers.
those
cases
hold
that
an
individual
in
custody
of
the
papers
can
invoke
the
privilege
only
with
respect
to
his
own
personal
papers,
not
with
respect
to
other
papers
whose
essential
characters,
the
expression
that
has
been
used
in
the
case
is
?non-personal,?
even
though
they
are
rightfully
in
his
possession
and
in
several
of
these
cases
even
though
he
has
a
claim
of
title
to
them.
in
fact,
the
grant
case
involved
a
claim
of
exclusive
title
by
the
sole
shareholder
of
a
dissolved
corporation.
the
bellis
case
also
involved
a
claim
of
co-ownership
of
the
records,
but
because
the
records
were
not
the
personal
papers
of
the
individual
claimant,
it
was
held
that
the
principle
of
the
boyd
case
does
not
apply.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
result
reached
by
the
third
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
here
follows
a
fortiori
from
these
cases,
since
here
there
could
not
even
be
a
claim
of
ownership
asserted.
in
both
instances,
the
district
court
found
that
the
papers
were
still
owned
by
the
accountant
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
those
findings.
there
was
some
evidence
to
the
contrary
in
one
of
the
cases,
but
it
was
properly
rejected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
is
the
law
of
the
states
involved,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
the
accountant
does
have
a
superior
proprietary
claim
if
he
should
choose
to
assert
it.
in
the
absence
of
express
contract
specifying
otherwise
the
accountant?s
records
and
work
papers
belong
to
the
accountant
rather
than
to
his
client.
but
we
do
not
think
the
criterion
in
these
case
really
rests
on
whether
the
possession
is
rightful,
whether
the
accountant
has
acquiesced
in
the
taxpayer?s
possession
of
the
records
or
whether
he
has
demanded
them
back.
it
seems
to
us
that
under
the
court?s
decision,
the
question
is
whether
these
are
the
personal
papers
of
the
individual
seeking
to
resist
producing
them.
otherwise,
you
get
into
the
situation
referred
to
many
years
ago
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
matter
of
harris,
of
use
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
a
method
of
gathering
evidence
that
could
then
be
immunized
from
legal
process.
as
he
put
it
in
that
case,
the
right
not
to
be
a
witness
against
one?s
self
is
not
a
right
to
appropriate
property
that
may
tell
one?s
story,
but
this
was
said
in
the
context
of
a
question
of
who
has
the
superior
proprietary
right
as
between
a
rupt
and
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
as
many
of
these
aphorisms
by
mr.
justice
holmes,
we
think
the
legal
principle
cuts
much
deeper
and
indeed
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
distinction
under
our
system
between
an
inquisitorial
and
an
accusatorial
system,
which
is
as
the
court
has
recognized
one
of
the
functions
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
one
of
the
purpose
is,
the
basic
policies
of
the
privileged,
as
recited
in
the
murphy
against
waterfront
commission
and
other
cases,
is
to
assure
that
we
will
have
an
accusatorial
system
of
justice
in
which
instead
of
extracting
incriminating
information
from
the
accused's
own
lips,
from
the
accused
himself,
evidence
will
be
gathered
from
other
sources.
this
line
would
become,
it
seems
to
me
irretrievably
blurred,
if
an
anticipation
of
valid
legal
process,
whether
it
is
an
internal
revenue
summons,
a
grand
jury
subpoena
or
a
trial
subpoena,
the
person
under
investigation
could
go
out
and
gather
up
the
evidence
that
is
supposed
to
be
used
in
place
of
forcing
incriminating
statements
from
his
own
lips
and
immunize
that
evidence
by
claiming
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
changes
the
function.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor
because
this
is
not
a
privileged
communication
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
accountant
as
the
court
recognized
in
couch.
we
see
very
little
difference,
i
mean,
obviously
the
accountant?s
information
has
to
be
an
information
that
the
taxpayer
has
given
him
in
one
way
or
the
another.
whether
it
is
verbally
or
in
writing,
so
long
as
it
is
a
non-privileged
disclosure,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
information
as
reflected
in
the
accountant?s
records
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
taxpayer?s
proper
scope
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
doubt
that
we
will
have
a
finding
in
these
cases
then
that
the
records
belong
to
the
accountant.
they
would
--
and
if
they
were
the
taxpayer?s
own
papers
of
which
the
accountant
had
returned
to
the
taxpayer
then
there
would
at
least
be
a
much
more
substantial
basis
for
assertion
of
the
claim
whether
there
would
be
some
impropriety
because
of
the
fact
that
the
investigation
was
already
underway,
i
think
could
be
argued.
but
in
the
absence
of
that
factor,
it
seems
to
me
that
private
papers
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer
are
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
boyd
case
is
about
and
in
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
it
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
--
i
would
answer
that
yes,
mr.
justice,
just
as
the
accountant
could
be
put
on
the
stand
and
required
to
testify
from
his
memory
of
what
figures
were
disclosed
to
him.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
he
could
remember
them,
if
you
had
an
accountant
with
a
photographic
memory,
he
might
certainly
remember
some
totals,
which
might
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
any
record
that
the
accountant
has
made
even
if
it
reflects
illegal
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
taxpayer
has
chosen
to
disclose
this
information
in
a
non-privileged
communication,
i
do
not
see
any
basis
for
resisting
the
testimony
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
disclosed
in
whatever
form
and
that
person
can
call
upon
his
own
record
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
all
of
those
cases
are
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
privilege
and
the
policies
underlying
the
privilege
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
would
not,
your
honor
and
we
do
not
believe
that
in
anticipation
of
legal
process,
documentary
evidence
of
this
sort
can
be
gathered
up
whether
by
purchase
or
by
persuasion
or
any
other
way
and
immunize
the
proper
legal
process.
now,
the
other
line
of
cases
that
also
supports
the
holding
below
of
the
third
circuit
en
banc
and
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
in
beattie,
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there-there
be
a
question
of
attorney-client
privilege
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
so,
your
honor.
although
in
the
privilege
relationship
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
lawyer,
there
is
a
basis
for
saying
that
the
taxpayer
retains
constructive
possession
of
his
papers
turned
over
to
the
lawyer
for
purposes
of
preparing
the
legal
defense
that
is
not
a
non-privilege
disclosure,
it
seems
to
us
quite
a
different
case.
the
other
line
of
authority
that
supports
the
third
circuit?s
holding
here
is
the
schmerber,
warden
against
hayden,
wade,
gilbert,
dionisio,
marron
line
of
authority.
the
leading
case
in
modern
times
being
schmerber,
which
limits
the
privilege
to
testimonial
or
communicative
compulsions,
and
the
boyd
principle
is
described
then
in
schmerber
as
being
a
principle
which
protects
responses,
which
are
themselves
communications.
here,
the
taxpayer
can
comply
with
the
subpoenas?
by
furnishing
the
accountant?s
records
without
making
any
incriminating
disclosure,
in
doing
so.
it
is
up
to
the
accountant
to
make
the
meaningful
to
authenticate
and
to
verify
their
accuracy
in
some
way.
they
have
no
evidentiary
significance
in
the
absence
of
that
verification
or
as
judge
friendly,
analyzed
to
this
point,
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
beattie
case
on
page
10a
of
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
?however,
in
order
to
bring
a
case
of
compelled
production
of
papers
within
the
privilege,
the
process
must
illicit
not
simply
responses
which
are
also
communications,
but
communicative
responses
tending
to
incriminate.
it
is
here
that
the
taxpayer?s
argument
breaks
down.
by
responding
to
the
summons
in
this
case,
the
taxpayer
would
not
be
admitting
the
genuineness,
correctness
or
reliability
of
the
accountant?s
work
papers.
he
would
be
admitting
only
his
present
possession
of
them
effect
of
no-significance
in
a
criminal
trial
for
filing
false
returns.?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
might
indeed,
and
i
think
often
whether
your
response
to
the
subpoena
would
have
evidentiary
significance,
would
depend
on
how
the
subpoena
is
drafted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
certainly
two
different
cases
whether
the
results
would
be
different,
if
you
were
asked
for
the
weapon
you
have
used
in
committing
a
certain
crime
on
a
certain
day,
or
if
you
are
asked
for
a
revolver
with
a
particular
description
known
to
be
on
your
possession
for
which
you
have
a
license.
i
do
not
--
we
do
not
need
in
this
case
to
decide
that
there
are
two
different
results,
but
it
is
certainly
two
different
cases
with
respect
to
the
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[laughter]
well,
we
have
take
the
position
with
respect
to
these
documents
that
turning
them
over
to
the
lawyer
does
not
increase
or
diminish
the
ability
of
the
taxpayer
to
claim
the
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
certainly
do
not
think
that
turning
them
over
to
the
lawyer
would
give
a
right
to
resist
their
production
that
would
not
otherwise
exist.
otherwise,
the
lawyer
would
become
a
sanctuary
for
incriminating
evidence
repository
for
it,
a
way
of
taking
it
out
of
circulation
and
making
it
unavailable
to
legal
process.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
sanctuary
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
privilege
were
extended
to
immunize
it
for
legal
process
such
as
a
search
warrant
or
a
subpoena,
merely
because
it
had
been
given
to
the
lawyer,
so
that
it
would
be
unavailable
for
trial
or
for
grand
jury
proceeding
or
what
have
you,
that
seems
to
us
to
be
an
improper
extension
of
the
lawyer-client
relationship.
at
least
with
respect
to
documentary
evidence
which
is
all
we
have
addressed
here,
tuning
over
to
the
lawyer
should
not
create
any
privilege
that
otherwise
did
not
exist,
with
respect
to
resistance
--
to
legal
process
demanding
production
of
the
documents.
any
disclosure
to
the
lawyer
by
the
client
would
be
within
the
attorney-client
privilege,
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
documents
that
were
made
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
and
the
reflect
is
not
privileged
disclosures
of
the
taxpayer
to
his
accountant,
not
disclosures
to
the
lawyer.
if
i
may,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
act
of
production
here
is
no
more
incriminating
than
was
the
act
of
production
in
bellis
or
in
white
or
wilson
or
that
whole
line
of
cases.
it
is
precisely
the
same
act
of
production
with
respect
to
its
communicative
nature.
it
says,
this
is
the
file
that
the
accountant
--
of
the
accountant?s
papers
that
he
placed
in
my
custody
just
as
in
bellis,
this
--
these
is
the
partnership
records
that
are
placed
in
my
custody
is
the
implicit
communication.
it
seems
to
me
that
line
of
cases
establishes
that
production
of
a
third
person?s
records
that
are
not
one?s
own
personal
papers
can
be
required
of
the
custodian.
the
fact
that
those
records
contain
information
about
the
taxpayer?s
personal
financial
affairs
is
not
controlling,
because
as
i
have
said
in
starting
my
analysis
for
my
argument,
the
records
could
have
been
required
to
be
produced
by
the
accountant
while
they
were
in
the
accountant?s
possession
even
though
they
have
this
information
in
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
his
own
personal
records.
that
is
the
distinction
that
that
is
the
operative
one
under
the
cases,
whether
the
records
are
his
own
personal
papers
or
whether
he
his
holding
in
his
custody
someone
else?s
record.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
raise
a
more
difficult
issue
under
boyd,
which
need
not
be
decided
here
and
i
might
not
foresee
all
the
possible
ramifications
there
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
we
do
not
subpoena
such
records
against
a
claimant,
privilege
would
not
subpoena
them?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
want
to
suggest
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
a
distinction.
this
is
the
disclosure
to
the
accountant
and
these
are
his
papers
and
they
are
his
papers
not
merely
because
of
ancient
documents
about
ownership
of
the
piece
of
paper,
because
as
the
court
recognized
in
couch
the
accountant
has
responsibilities
under
the
internal
revenue
laws
to
be
able
to
substantiate
that
he
filed
accurate
tax
returns
and
that
he
is
conducting
his
business
in
accordance
with
law.
but
we
do
agree
that
ownership
is
not
in
itself
the
governing
criterion.
we
think
if
the
taxpayer
had
acquired
title
whether
by
purchase
or
by
some
other
method,
the
result
would
not
change
because
these
would
still
not
be
his
personal
papers.
their
essential
character
just
as
in
grant
would
remain
third
person
records,
even
though
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
make
no
difference,
your
honor.
thank
you.
