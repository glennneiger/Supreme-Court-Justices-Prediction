mr.
wallace,
do
you
think
the
accountant
would
be
entitled
to
a
return
of
those
papers
if
he
made
a
demand
for
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
your
position
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
search
warrant
would
be
equally
effective?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
it
is
a
publication
of
testimony
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
are
you
suggesting
a
search
warrant
could
be
validly
used
to
secure
these
papers
from
the
accountant?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
with
a
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
subpoena
simply
described
the
piece
of
paper
with
a
certain
title
on
it,
certain
set
of
--
produce
any
paper
with
a
certain
title
on
it
and
dated
a
certain
date,
not
saying
that
who
it
belong
to
or
anything
else,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
having
possession
of
it
would
be
irrelevant
piece
of
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
always,
i
would
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is,
that
is
peculiar
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
would
you
say
that
you
could
subpoena
the
records
from
the
taxpayer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
cannot
subpoena
them,
even
though
the
act
of
production
might
not
be
incriminating
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
situation
in
these
cases
maybe
briefly
stated.
in
each
case,
a
taxpayer
obtained
from
his
accountant,
the
accountant’s
work
papers
that
have
been
used
in
the
preparation
of
the
taxpayer’s
tax
returns.
taxpayer
then
delivered
the
papers
to
his
attorney
where
they
were
subpoenaed
by
internal
revenue
service
agents
who
were
investigation
the
taxpayer.
the
issue
is
whether
the
papers
were
immune
from
the
subpoena
by
reason
of
the
fifth
amendment’s
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
that
they
were
not
immune.
we
agree
with
that
court
and
affirm
that
judgment.
in
the
other
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
to
the
contrary
and
hence
we
reverse
the
judgment
in
74-611.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
