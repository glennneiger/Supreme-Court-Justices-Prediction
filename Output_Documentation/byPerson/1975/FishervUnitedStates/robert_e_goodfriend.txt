mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
the
government?s
argument
in
this
case,
they
say
that
the
privilege
is
unavailable
to
the
taxpayer
here,
basically
for
four
reasons.
one,
they
say
the
taxpayer
did
not
own
these
papers;
two,
he
was
not
the
author
of
them;
three,
he
did
not
maintain
them
in
sufficient
secrecy,
that
argument
is
not
made
explicitly,
but
the
quotation
from
the
language
from
couch
about
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
relied
on.
and
finally,
they
rely
on
this
doctrine
which
is
explained
more
fully
by
judge
friendly
in
the
beattie
decision,
that
there
is
in
effect
no
incriminating
act
of
production
here,
and
therefore,
production
of
the
records
they
say
will
not
incriminate
the
taxpayer.
that
premise,
as
i
understand
it,
that
theory
is
based
on
the
notion
that
the
privilege
does
not
protect
the
writing
itself,
but
rather
the
privilege
insofar
as
applied
to
documentary
evidence
is
based
upon
the
testimonial
act
of
production.
we
take
issue
seriatim
with
each
of
these
arguments.
first,
we
say
that
this
court
has
held
in
couch
and
in
white
that
ownership,
that
to
the
tie
the
privilege
to
ownership
is
a
meaningless
--
is
to
draw
a
meaningless
line.
and
in
the
white
decision
the
court
said,
that
the
papers
in
effect
which
the
privilege
protects
must
be
the
private
property
of
the
person
claiming
the
privilege
or
at
least
in
his
possession
in
a
purely
personal
capacity.
certainly
admitting
the
possibility
of
the
application
of
the
privilege
to
papers
that
are
not
owned
by
a
person.
now,
before
this
argument,
my
colleague
and
i
investigated
something
that
was
not
--
has
not
been
hereto
before
investigated
at
any
point
in
this
case.
namely,
what
is
the
basis
in
common
law
for
saying
that
accountant?s
work
papers
are
in
fact
the
property
of
the
accountant.
now,
i
went
back
and
among
the
very
few
cases,
i
was
able
to
find,
was
a
case,
a
massachusetts
case
of
ipswich
mills
versus
dylan
in
19
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
it
is
not
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
it
is
a
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
it
appears
at
53
alr
792
and
in
that
ca
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
it
is
an
old-timer,
your
honor,
and
i
have
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
ipswich
mills
versus
william
dylan.
one
of
the
few
cases
i
could
find
directly
on
the
property,
the
common
law
property
concepts
involved
in
this
case
and
as
best
as
i
could
tell,
accountant?s
work
papers
are
owned
by
the
accountant
because
the
paper
upon
which
his
computations
are
made
is
owned
by
the
accountant
before
he
applies
his
functions
or
applies
the
figures
to
them.
as
the
court
there
said,
the
paper
on
which
the
computations
were
made
belong
to
them,
that
is
the
accountants.
they
were
not
employed
to
make
these
sheets.
the
sheets
were
merely
the
means
by
which
the
work
for
which
the
defendants?
were
employed
might
be
accomplished.
the
title
to
the
worksheets
remained
in
the
defendants?
after
the
computations
were
made.
in
the
absence
of
an
agreement
that
these
sheets
were
to
belong
to
the
plaintiff,
or
were
to
be
held
for
it,
they
were
owned
by
the
defendants,
that
is
the
accountants.
now,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
court
meant
what
it
said
in
the
couch
case
when
it
stated
that
to
tie
the
privilege
to
a
concept
of
ownership
is
to
draw
a
meaningless
line.
and
that
this
fact
illustrates
it
because
the
concept
of
ownership,
a
great
constitutional
privilege
should
not
turn
on
a
question
as
privilege
as
who
owned
the
paper
prior
to
the
performance
of
the
accountant?s
functions,
nor
we
submit;
will
anything
be
accomplished
in
this
court
if
that
ownership
concept
is
adopted,
since
all
that
will
be
required
to
alter
to
outcome
of
any
case
will
be
a
prior
agreement
between
the
client
and
his
accountant
that
the
work
papers
will
be
owned
by
the
client
when
the
work
is
done,
as
we
understand
the
common
law
concepts
of
ownership
as
applicable
to
this
situation.
we
also
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
why
would
there
be
burden
to
who
owned
the
accountant?s
work
papers?
i
do
not
see
it
--
see
the
problem.
i
mean,
you
just
take
them
home
if
you
--
if
you
want
them,
you
put
them
in
a
drawer
if
you
do
not,
you
just
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
in
that
event
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
i
see.
yes,
that
it
--
would
his
--
would
shifting
the
ownership
though
of
the
work
papers
necessarily
--
necessarily
change
the
question
of
who
is
liable?
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
i
am
suggesting
that
a
great
constitutional
--
that
it
is
indeed
to
draw
a
meaningless
line,
as
the
court
has
stated
in
couch
and
the
reason
i
emphasize
what
the
court
has
stated
is
because
both
judge
friendly
in
the
beattie
decision
and
in
the
fisher
case,
the
judge
has
attempted
to
explain
away
this
court?s
language.
rather
than
simply
the
argue
the
court?s
language
back
to
the
court,
which
a
court
is
in
the
best
position
to
construe
and
interpret,
i
tried
to
understand
by
going
to
the
basis
of
these
concepts
why
that
was
in
fact
the
case.
the
other
reason
very
quickly,
why
we
say
ownership
is
not
only
meaningless
in
an
elevation
of
form
over
substance,
but
also
we
think
very
dangerous
is
we
pose
to
the
court,
the
situations
for
example,
where,
let
us
say
notes
of
a
psychiatrist
or
notes
of
a
priest
in
the
confessional
might
be
involved
in
the
governmental
subpoena
--
summons
case,
perhaps
having
come
back
into
the
possession
either
of
the
parishioner
or
of
the
client.
in
those
situations
if
ownership
dictates
the
outcome
of
the
privilege,
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
common
law
that
those
papers
as
they
--
as
they
were
originated
were
the
property
of
the
psychiatrist
or
of
the
priest.
yet
we
suggest
that
the
statements
they
contain
are
essentially
a
blueprint
of
a
man?s
mind
and
they
are
as
entitled
to
the
privilege
as
statements
to
a
man
makes
upon
the
witness
stand
himself.
we
move
to
the
question
of
authorship.
we
do
not
think
that
authorship,
as
this
court
has
stated
flatly
in
wilson
versus
united
states,
can
vary
the
applicability
of
the
privilege.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
no,
i
am
saying
if
the
ownership
dominated
over
everything
else
then
in
the
case
of
the
psychiatrist
notes
or
notes
that
a
priest
might
have
made
about
the
statements
he
heard
in
the
confession,
that
insofar
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned,
putting
aside
other
privileges,
under
the
government?s
theory
in
these
cases
those
papers
would
be
compellable,
would
be
producible,
because
as
they
originated,
they
were
unquestionably
the
property
of
a
third
party
and
not
the
claimants.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
i
would
put
the
emphasis
one
on
the
possession,
and
the
testimonial
compulsion,
which
is
unquestionably
being
directed
to
the
accused
in
this
case,
to
the
accused
and
to
a
person
in
such
an
intimate
relationship,
namely
the
attorney,
that
is
tantamount
to
be
directed
to
the
accused.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
i
think
that
is
the
burdeau
versus
mcdowell
case
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
i
think
this
court
has
answered
that
question.
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
address
myself
if
i
may
before
going
into
authorships,
since
i
think
that
is
clear.
to
judge
friendly?s
analysis
in
the
beattie
case,
which
i
find
extremely
troublesome
and
which
i
think
will
virtually
end
the
application
--
if
adopted
will
end
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
documents.
as
i
understand,
judge
friendly?s
theorem,
by
the
way
this
theory
was
no
where
inserted
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
united
state
versus
kasmir.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
in
this,
i
think
this
case
illustrates
it.
there
are
many
documents,
which
reflect
prior
testimonial
communications,
admissions,
confessions
of
the
accused
himself.
if
those
documents
are
back
into
his
possession,
and
he
--
judicial
process
is
issued
to
him,
he
is
essentially
republishing
under
compulsory
process
his
own
prior
statements.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
my
answer
to
that
privacy
rationale,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
suppose
i
where
to
admit
that
i
committed
a
crime
to
a
friend
of
mine,
and
the
government
knew
of
that,
they
would
be
able
to
put
the
friend
on
the
stand
and
have
him
testify,
but
because
of
that
fact,
they
could
make
me
mount
the
stand
and
repeat
what
i
had
told
him
previously.
in
fact,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
rationale,
which
was
--
which
the
government
relies
on
here,
is
totally
misapplied
in
this
case.
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
couch,
when
it
was
directing
its
attention
to
the
--
to
the
statement
that
there
was
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
between
the
accountant
and
the
--
and
the
accused
was
to
mrs.
couch?s
argument
that
she
stood
in
these
shoes
of
the
accountant,
therefore,
directing
process
to
her
accountant,
was
the
same
as
directing
process
to
her.
that
is
a
very
different
question
in
what
is
involved
here.
namely,
there
is
no
question
that
the
government
concedes
that
directing
process
to
one?s
attorney
is
tantamount
to
directing
process
to
the
accused.
what
they
are
saying
--
arguing
instead
is,
if
you
somehow
treated
these
papers
previously
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
privacy
concepts,
namely,
you
gave
him
to
an
accountant
for
purpose
of
republication
portions
of
the
information,
then
you
have
forfeited
the
privilege
and
we
are
now
authorized
to
compel
you
to
produce
documents
in
your
actual
possession.
so,
privacy
becomes
a
rationale
for
authorizing
or
justifying
testimonial
compulsion
directly
against
the
accused.
we
reject
that
proposition.
we,
turning
again,
to
judge
friendly?s
analysis,
which
i
think
is
critical,
judge
friendly
says
in
effect
that
the
application
of
documents
is
limited
to
this
act
of
production
and
he
says
in
this
case
if
the
taxpayer
comes
forward
with
the
records
there
will
be
no
incriminating
act.
we
submit
that,
first
of
all
under
the
curcio
rationale
there
is
a
testimonial
statement
with
the
productions
even
in
this
case.
namely,
when
you
come
forward
you
state
--
the
attorney
comes
forward
and
states
and
i
think
it
would
be
binding
on
his
client
that
these
are
all
the
records
called
for
by
the
summons.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
that
is
right,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
did
say
in
dicta
in
that
case
that
when
you
come
forward
you
make
a
statement.
the
holding
of
the
case
that
is
correct,
was
whether
that
you
could
go
further
and
compel
him
to
tell
you
the
whereabouts
of
records
when
you
place
them
elsewhere,
but
what
the
court
said
there
was
in
that
case
the
mere
act
of
production
was
not
incriminating
because
you
recall
there
was
a
collective
entity
involved,
and
therefore,
with
respect
to
the
act
of
production
there
was
no
incriminating
statement;
since
the
collective
entity
of
association
or
partnership
had
no
privilege.
here
the
government
has
expressly
taken
that
point
out
of
the
case.
they
say
they
are
not
arguing
the
collective
entity
exception.
so
therefore,
here
when
you
come
forward
and
produce
the
papers
and
a
natural
individual
and
he
says
these
are
all
the
papers
called
for
by
the
summons,
that
is
in
fact
an
identifying
act
and
the
mere
fact
under
judge
friendly?s
theory
that
you
can
get
the
accountant
to
do
that
for
you,
is
not
a
reason
to
make
the
accused
himself
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
take
the
position
on
that
simply
that
a
lawyer?s
admissions
made
in
the
course
of
a
judicial
proceeding
are
normally
binding
upon
his
client
and
the
same
would
probably
apply
here.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
we
say
this.
we
say
that
the
policy
of
allowing
the
lawyer
to
invoke
the
privilege
is
the
same
here
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
the
attorney-client
privilege,
where
the
lawyer
not
only
is
allowed
to
invoke
the
privilege,
but
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
do
so
and
the
reason
is
to
promote
the
policy
of
free
communication
between
lawyer
and
client
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
your
honor,
first
in
this
case
of
course
we
are
not
dealing
as
we
were
in
huffman
with
oral
statements.
we
are
dealing
with
--
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
well,
i
think
because
first
of
all
the
documents
determine
the
incriminating
nature
of
the
material,
but
more
importantly
because
the
--
if
you
do
not
permit
the
lawyer
to
assert
this
on
behalf
of
his
client,
we
submit
that
it
will
chill
the
transfer
of
documents
between
the
lawyer
and
his
client
because
the
lawyer
will
always
be
in
fear
if
he
possesses
the
documents
necessary
to
make
an
intelligent
decision
on
a
tax
fraud
investigation
case.
he
will
always
be
in
fear,
my
god!
the
client
may
not
be
around
when
the
day
comes
when
the
government
subpoenas
these
documents
from
me.
so
i
am
going
to
make
sure
that
whenever
i
examine
these
documents
i
do
it
in
my
client?s
home
or
he
does
it
my
office.
also
we
say,
your
honor,
that
this
is
a
matter
entirely
within
the
government?s
own
control,
under
their
own
rules
stated
to
this
court
in
couch.
they
usually
direct
the
subpoena
to
the
man
who
has
the
right
to
custody
as
opposed
to
the
man
who
has
physical
custody.
so,
the
whole
standing
question
has
been
created
by
the
person
to
whom
the
government
shows
to
direct
the
summons.
had
they
directed
the
summons
to
the
client
and
said
produce
any
records
that
you
have
or
that
are
in
custody
of
your
agents,
there
would
be
no
standing
question
in
the
case.
i
would
like
to
answer
a
few
questions
justice
--mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
a
question
of
opposing
counsel,
whether
or
not
we
thought
that
the
accountant
could
seek
return
of
the
papers
from
the
taxpayer.
i
would
say
that
that
depends
on
the
reason
you
are
seeking
return
of
the
papers.
if
he
is
seeking
return
of
the
papers
for
his
own
property
purposes,
as
in
matter
of
harris,
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy
was
invested
with
title,
then
i
think
he
would
have
a
good
shot
at
it
in
a
state
court,
although
even
there
i
think
the
taxpayer
here
would
have
a
defense,
namely,
the
papers
were
turned
over
expressly
stated
by
the
accounting
firm,
turned
over
and
giving
the
taxpayer
the
rightful
indefinite
and
legitimate
possession
of
such
documents.
mr.
robert
e.
goodfriend
thank
you.
