you
are
talking
now
simply
about
a
subpoena
to
produce
a
non-testimony

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
make
any
difference
if
the
accountant?s
work
papers
were
based
on
the
taxpayer?s
own
personal
records?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
government
directs
a
subpoena
to
me,
requiring
a
production
of
some
counterfeit
plates
or
counterfeit
money
that
i
have
made,
might
that
be
a
different
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
the
elements
of
the
crime
being
investigated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
he
once
lets
them
out,
they
lack
certainly
some
of
the
privacy
that
some
of
our
cases
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
curcio
was
examined
at
some
length
as
to
why
it
did
not
have
the
records,
not
why
he
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
are
asking
a
lawyer
to
do
it,
here
you
are
not
asking
the
accused
to
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
a
lawyer
invoke
a
client's
fifth
amendment
privilege,
if
it
is
a
personal
privilege
which
must
depend
on
assertion
that
the
thing
would
be
incriminated,
how
can
a
lawyer
know
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
take
a
typical
trial
and
if
your
client
is
not
a
defendant,
he
has
to
mount
the
stand
and
claim
the
privilege
question
by
question.
most
judges
would
not
hear
of
his
lawyer
saying,
my
client
declines
to
answer;
it
is
the
client
that
has
got
to
make
the
assertion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
should
that
be
any
different
with
documents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
mr.
bazelon,
how
personal
are
canceled
checks
which
presumably
you
have
already
sent
out
to
a
payee,
they
have
been
paid
through
a
bank,
they
certainly
are
not
like
a
diary,
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
incriminatory
link
in
just
the
production
along
the
lines
that
you
are
just
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
apart
from
the
content
of
those
records,
how
does
that
assertion,
if
it
be
an
assertion,
tend
to
incriminate
him
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how?
