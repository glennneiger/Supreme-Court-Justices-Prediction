mr.
may,
you
put
so
much
emphasis
on
retail.
it
does
not
really
mean
that
much,
does
it?
would
a
wholesale
not
be
in
the
same
--
i
mean,
you
transport
them
from
here
to
the
wholesaler
in
michigan,
say,
100
tires,
when
they
get
there,
it
is
over,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
are
wholesalers.
for
example,
you
and
i
know
that
fleets
of
cab
and
fleets
of
trucks
buy
tires
wholesale,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
they
would
not
be
covered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
this,
but
you
keep
emphasizing
they
are
not
liable
until
they
go
to
retail
and
i
am
saying,
could
there
not
be
a
place
where
they
could
go
liable
and
be
a
wholesale.
i
do
not
think
it
hurts
your
case
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
