justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
state
has
taken
no
cross-petition
from
the
decision
adverse
to
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
your
argument
that
you
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia’s
decision
is
wrong
because
it
has
treated
differently
two
things
that
are
alike,
would
not
necessarily
win
for
you
here.
maybe
it
was
wrong
in
ruling
that
the
tube
boxes
were
not
taxable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
got
to
make
your
comparison
with
some
authoritative
decision
on
the
liability
for
a
packaged
import.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
may
have
been
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
decided
against
the
assessor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
brown
against
maryland
was
the
tax
requirement
of
a
license
on
someone
who
sold
imports,
it
was
not
a
general
ad
valorem
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
make
of
the
case
of
may
against
new
orleans?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
think
then
that
--
do
you
pronounce
it
gwin-nett
or
gwinnett?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
think
that
gwinnett
county
is
entitled
to
any
sort
of
pro
rata
contribution
from
your
client
for
the
fire
protection
or
the
police
protection
that
it
provides
for
your
client’s
warehouse,
even
though
it
gets
pro
rata
contributions
from
other
people
who
get
exactly
the
same
services?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
as
many
ways
as
you
want?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
said
“impose
or
duties.”
i
did
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
did
not
hold
that
because
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
did
not
hold
that
because
what
it
was
dealing
with
was
a
license
tax
on
who
sought
to
solely
sell
imports.
you
can
say
that
justice
marshall
said
it
in
the
opinion,
but
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
holding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
once
an
importer
pays
a
duty
exacted
by
the
federal
government
no
further
tax
burden
of
any
sort
may
be
placed
on
his
sale
of
those
goods
that
are
imported?
you
would
not
go
that
far,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
distinguish
between
wholesale
and
retail?
what
is
there
in
the
import
clause
that
leads
to
that
conclusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
not
say
the
same
that
retail
goods,
they
are
still
flowing.
you
do
not
know
who
the
ultimate
purchaser
is
going
to
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
gwinnett
county
mechanically
go
about
levying
its
tax
in
this
case?
does
the
assessor
come
around
once
a
year
to
every
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
self-assessment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
as
of
a
particular
date
each
year?
