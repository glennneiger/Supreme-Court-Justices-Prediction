justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case
the
petitioner
michelin
tire
corporation
imported
auto
and
truck
tires
from
france
and
nova
scotia
and
stocked
them
in
its
georgia
warehouse
awaiting
sales
to
its
hundreds
of
franchised
retail
tire
outlets
in
the
southeast
states.
georgia
assessed
ad
valorem
property
taxes
against
tires
and
the
georgia
court's
sustained
the
tax.
the
opinions
of
the
two
georgia
courts
involved
recognized
that
over
100
years
ago
this
court
in
low.
v.
austin
held
that
even
a
nondiscriminatory
ad
valorem
property
tax
was
a
state
imposed
duty
prohibited
by
article
i
section
10
of
the
constitution
which
provides
that
no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress
lay
any
imposts
or
duties
on
imports
or
exports,
say
what
may
be
absolutely
necessary
for
executing
its
inspection
laws.
the
georgia
courts
concluded
however
that
the
tires
had
lost
their
status
as
imports
on
the
tax
date
and
thus
had
become
subject
to
the
georgia
tax.
today
we
affirm
the
georgia
supreme
court
but
not
on
the
ground
on
which
it
sustained
the
tax.
rather,
we
overruled
low
v.
austin
and
hold
that
georgia's
nondiscriminatory
ad
valorem
property
tax
levied
against
the
imported
tires
did
not
constitute
the
laying
of
an
impost
or
duty
on
imports
within
the
prohibition
of
article
i
section
10.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
of
the
affirmance.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
and
decision
of
the
case.
