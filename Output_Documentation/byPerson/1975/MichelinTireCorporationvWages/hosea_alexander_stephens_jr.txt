mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
argument
in
behalf
of
the
respondent,
i
respectfully
submit,
should
begin
by
noting
that
the
right
of
a
state
and
its
political
subdivisions
to
levy
non-discriminatory
ad
valorem
taxes
on
property
located
within
its
boundaries
is
an
inherent
attribute
of
sovereignty.
the
constitution
of
georgia
so
declares.
its
taxation
scheme
expressly
states
that
the
property
of
non-residents
shall
not
be
taxed
higher
than
that
of
residents.
so,
there
is
no
contention
here
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
that
there
has
been
any
discrimination
against
the
petitioner
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
non-resident
of
georgia
rather
than
a
resident.
now,
the
last
term
as
is
fully
known
to
the
members
of
the
court,
in
the
national
cash
register
case,
there
was
a
determination
as
to
when
american-made
goods,
possessing
very
unique
qualities,
unsuited
for
use
except
by
some
foreign
nation,
when
they
become
exports
and
in
this
particular
case,
to
some
extent,
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
is
before
the
court
and
that
is
when
foreign-made
goods
actually
cease
to
be
imports.
now,
the
georgia
supreme
court,
after
cataloging
numerous
cases,
concluded
that,
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
gunter,
that
the
case
has
established
a
sort
of
two-hat
approach
to
the
import
process
and
it
depends
on
which
hat
the
particular
concern
is
wearing,
whether
that
of
an
importer
or
that
of
a
wholesaler.
and
certainly,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
spent
some
time
analyzing
brown
against
maryland
and
it
is
obvious
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
no
desire
to
ignore
the
holdings
of
that
court
in
that
particular
decision,
but
it
did
lay
emphasis
upon
the
factual
aspect
of
this
particular
situation
and
while
it
is
not
a
link
to
the
record,
it
began
with
the
first
specific
matter
which
is
that
michelin
owns
a
warehouse
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia
on
the
north
side
of
atlanta,
and
utilizes
a
bonded
warehouse
in
clayton
county,
georgia
on
the
south
side
of
atlanta,
thereby,
a
permanent
distribution,
a
center
has
been
set
up
in
the
atlanta
area.
bulk
shipped
lots
of
tires
in
closed
in
sea
vans
and
over-the-road
containers
arrive
at
these
warehouses
at
recurring
intervals.
the
sea
vans
and
over-the-road
containers
are
opened,
entries
are
made
into
it
and
the
tires
are
placed
on
pallets.
each
pallet
with
tires
loaded
on
it,
it
is
then
moved
into
the
warehouse.
the
tires
are
segregated
by
size
and
style,
as
was
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
they
are
then
stacked.
four
stacks
of
five
tires
each
on
a
pallet
with
a
heavy
cardboard
comb
put
down
between
it
and
another
pallet
of
three
tires
placed
over.
there
is
no
question,
but
a
new
shipment
is
introduced
into
that
warehouse
with
the
residue
of
what
has
been
left
from
previous
shipment,
and
furthermore,
that
shipment
arriving
from
france
and
shipments
arriving
from
nova
scotia
are
distinguishable
only
by
the
word
“made
in
france”
or
“made
in
canada”
appearing
on
it.
then,
the
process
of
getting
them
out
of
the
warehouse
was
developed.
orders
received
by
michelin
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia
at
its
facility,
they
are
on
highway
i85,
are
filled
from
this
--
i
am
going
to
use
the
word
“co-mingled”
inventory
because
i
submit
that
is
what
it
shows
had
occurred.
they
are
shipped
by
common
carrier,
united
parcel
service,
or
a
dealer.
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
no,
sir.
those
were
imports.
one
thing
developed
in
the
course
of
the
trial
before
judge
peter
in
gwinnett
superior
court
and
it
was
discovered
that
a
small
quantity
of
domestic-made
tubes
were
left
over
from
a
previous
year.
as
i
remember,
they
figured
a
small
amount
of
tax
and
paid
it
in
the
courtroom
as
part
of
the
hearing.
they
realized
that
was
not
exempt.
previous
imports
were
in
the
warehouse.
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
were
what
is
known
as
nod
assessments,
and
of
course,
as
the
record
indicates
at
one
point,
there
are
approximately
five
other
import
firms
located
in
the
county.
that
is
a
byproduct
of
interstate
highways,
your
honor,
in
north
of
atlanta,
four-lane
highways
on
the
either
side,
warehousing,
so
there
are
other
import
firms
in
the
county.
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
well,
theoretically,
your
honor,
all
concerns
are
suppose
like
paying
income
taxes
to
voluntarily
--
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
it
is
a
self-assessment
situation.
if
the
investigator
for
the
tax
assessors
concludes
that
maybe
a
return
was
due
or
not
enough
property
was
covered,
he
will
go
out
and
make
an
inspection
on
the
premises
and
--
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
yes
sir,
january
1
of
each
year
is
the
critical
date
for
ad
valorem
tax
purposes
in
georgia.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
this
matter
is,
in
reality,
controlled
by
may
against
new
orleans
which
has
already
been
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
discussed
to
some
extent
by
the
philosophy
of
burke
against
wells,
that
is
the
case
in
new
york
city
in
which
an
import
firm
established
a
wareroom
and
was
vending
in
the
original
package
articles
imported
from
ireland.
and
the
state
of
new
york,
instead
of
issuing
an
ad
valorem
assessment
on
the
property
itself,
issued
an
assessment
on
the
capital
of
the
company
utilized
in
that
particular
process
which
was
retained
from
the
sales
of
the
goods,
but
much
of
the
language
in
that
opinion
indicates
that
if
it
had
been
an
ad
valorem
assessment
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
because
the
court
in
its
opinion,
went
back
to
brown
versus
maryland,
discussed
when
the
original
package
doctrine
loses
its
force
or
validity,
and
placed
the
two
in
exactly
the
same
context.
now,
as
to
what
an
original
package
is,
in
our
brief
we
have
stressed
a
line
of
cases
holding
that
if,
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did,
the
sea
van
or
over-the-road
container
concept
is
rejected
as
the
original
package
that
the
aggregation
of
goods
is
a
definition
which
emerged
very
early
in
jurisprudence
in
the
austin
case
from
tennessee
and
that
the
aggregation
of
goods
where
they
are
not
individually
wrapped,
constitutes
the
original
package.
and,
we
rely
upon
ej
stanton
&
sons
case
from
california
in
which
it
was
referred
to
as
invisible
customer
and
that
is
some
language
to
which
the
petitioner
took
strong
exception
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
the
briefs,
but
it
merely
illustrates
the
premise
that
an
aggregation
of
goods
or,
as
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
termed
it,
the
commercial
unit
of
importation,
when
that
is
broken,
the
package
is
broken.
and
in
this
particular
case
when
michelin
established
a
distribution
center
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia
and
even
in
clayton
county,
georgia,
although
they
are
not
a
party
here,
and
on
a
regular
sustained
recurring
basis
just
as
in
burke
against
wells
in
new
york,
on
a
week-to-week,
day-to-day,
month-to-month
basis
had
goods
available
for
shipment,
received
goods
to
replace
those
shipped,
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
that
really
is
the
end
of
the
importation
process
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
correctly
so
determined.
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
--
mr.
hosea
alexander
stephens,
jr.
i
believe
that
was
the
holding
of
the
volkswagen
pacific
case
from
california,
your
honor.
that
is
referred
to
in
the
briefs.
in
that
particular
case,
the
facts
were
packaged
automobile
parts
and
completed
vw
and
porsche
automobiles
were
being
brought
in
by
sea
going
vessels.
and
as
i
remember,
and
do
not
hold
me
to
this
because
i
have
not
read
this
case
today,
as
i
remember,
the
packaged
auto
parts
were
held
exempt,
but
the
automobiles
had
to
have
things
done
to
them
to
get
them
ready
and
while
the
outward
form
or
shape
of
the
vehicle
was
not
changed,
it
could
no
longer
be
in
the
original
form
because
it
would
be
the
difference
between
being
able
to
crank
it
up
and
drive
it
away
and
not
crank
it
up
and
drive
it
away.
i
believe
the
california
case
has
ruled
only.
as
i
remember,
this
court
declined
a
grant
to
certiorari
in
that
particular
case
which
i
fully
appreciate,
is
not
very
decisive.
now,
as
to
the
statement
in
brown
versus
maryland
which
has
been
urged
by
petitioner’s
counsel
here,
in
a
footnote
to
our
brief,
we
invite
attention
to
an
article
by
professor
thomas
reed
powell.
i
was
never
so
fortunate
as
to
attend
that
university
or
be
one
of
its
students,
but
i
have
always
regarded
him
as
a
very
outstanding
writer
and
his
comment
was
that
the
language
of
mr.
marshall,
certainly
was
broad
enough
to
include
sale,
or
use,
or
breaking
bulk
and
we
submit
when
an
import
firm
gets
into
the
distribution
business
such
as
shown
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
maintaining
of
the
tires
for
inventory
meet
the
test
of
use,
as
referred
to
as
youngstown
and
it
certainly
meets
the
test
of
burke
against
wells
where
they
had
a
permanent
wareroom
in
new
york
city
and
was
vending
from
the
original
package.
if
the
court
would
bear
with
me,
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
just
one
quote
from
may
against
new
orleans.
“the
goods
imported,
lost
their
distinctive
character
as
imports
and
became
a
part
of
the
general
mass
of
the
property
of
louisiana
and
subject
to
local
taxation
as
other
property
in
that
state
the
moment
the
boxes,
cases,
or
bales
in
which
they
were
shipped
reached
their
destination
for
use
or
trade
and
were
opened
and
the
separate
packages
therein
exposed
to
sale.”
now,
we
submit
that
the
breaking
of
a
bulk
shipment
of
tires,
the
aggregation
of
goods,
the
commercial
unit
of
importation
or
whatever
it
is
and
the
exposing
of
the
individual
tires
for
sale,
if
that
occurs,
the
import
process
has
terminated
and
just
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said,
then
the
concern
dawns
the
hat
of
a
wholesaler.
thank
you,
your
honor.
