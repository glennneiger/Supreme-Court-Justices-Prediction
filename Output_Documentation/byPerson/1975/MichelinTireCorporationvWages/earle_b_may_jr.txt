mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
which
involves
the
import
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
proper
interpretation
and
application
of
that
clause
to
imported
tires
and
tubes.
the
sole
issue
is
whether
tires
imported
without
packaging
and
held
for
the
sale
by
the
importer
in
his
warehouse,
in
the
original
form
in
which
imported
are
immune
from
local
ad
valorem
taxes
by
reason
of
the
import
clause.
the
trial
court
upheld
the
importer’s
claim
of
immunity
with
respect
to
both
tires
and
tubes.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affirmed
with
respect
to
the
tubes,
but
reversed
with
respect
of
the
tires,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
both
the
tire
and
the
tubes
are
handled
precisely
in
the
same
manner
while
in
the
importer’s
warehouse.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
except
the
state
is
not
actually
the
party,
it
is
the
local
gwinnett
county
tax
officials
who
imposed
the
taxes,
of
course,
pursuant
to
georgia
constitutional
provisions,
but
the
state
of
georgia,
as
such,
is
not
a
party.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
that
could
well
be,
your
honor,
but
it
is
our
position
contrary
to
what
you
just
said
that
we
do
think
that
if
the
result
of
georgia
supreme
court
decision
is
to
accord
less
immunity
to
an
unpackaged
import
then
that
accorded
to
a
packaged
import,
that
it
is
wrong
because
the
constitutional
prohibition
is
to
command
immunity
for
all
imports,
whether
packaged
or
unpackaged.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
well,
we
submit
there
are
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
which
clearly
recognized
tax
immunity
for
packaged
imports,
if
the
court
please.
the
facts
of
their
brief,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
importer
is
a
new
york
corporation
that
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
importing
and
distributing
wholesale
tires
and
tubes
that
are
manufactured
outside
the
united
states
and
as
a
part
of
its
business,
it
operates
a
distribution
warehouse
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
the
tires
are
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
believe
that
answer
is
in
the
record
and
i
do
not
honestly
know.
i
believe
the
answer
would
be
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
cannot
answer
that
precisely.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
except
to
the
extent
that
our
argument
that
the
decision
of
the
georgia
court
accords
unequal
treatment
to
packaged
and
unpackaged
imports.
to
that
extent,
the
court
might
be
concerned
with
it,
but
there
was
no
cross-petition
filed
by
the
tax
officials.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
one
way
under
the
present
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court,
that
our
client
could
avoid
taxation
by
putting
each
tire
in
a
separate
package
so
long
as
the
package
was
not
broken
and
the
tire
would
--
if
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
to
be
consistent,
would
be
immune
from
taxation.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
or
france,
yes
sir.
the
facts
show
that
no
sales
are
made
to
retail
customers,
all
sale
to
be
made
to
wholesale
and
on
all
such
imported
tires
and
tubes
the
importer
has
paid
to
the
united
states
the
4%
import
duty.
the
tires
are
imported
without
packaging
and
are
never
altered
or
modified
in
any
way
from
the
original
form
in
which
they
were
imported.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
may
it
please
the
court,
expressly
recognized
at
page
a7
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
individual
tires
are
not
treated
or
altered
in
any
manner,
but
they,
nevertheless,
deny
immunity
upon
the
ground,
as
shown
at
page
a18
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
that
the
tires
had
lost
their
status
as
imports
when
they
were
segregated
by
size
and
style
and
stacked
in
the
importer’s
warehouse
with
other
similar
imported
tires
of
the
same
size
and
style
and
it
is
this
decision,
may
it
please
the
court,
which
is
presently
here
for
review
and
we
believe
the
decision
is
erroneous
and
our
contentions
are
based
primarily
upon
four
facts.
number
one,
the
original
form
had
not
been
changed.
number
two,
the
tires
were
still
in
the
flow
of
import
distribution
and
had
not
reached
the
point
of
final
destination
as
they
had
in
youngstown,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
right
to
sell
which
has
never
been
seriously
challenged
until
now,
the
importer’s
right
to
sell,
and
four,
the
unequal
treatment
accorded
to
unpackaged
imports
as
compared
with
packaged
imports
as
we
were
just
discussing
with
justice
rehnquist.
first,
it
is
undisputed,
your
honors,
that
the
tires
were
imported
without
packaging
and
at
all
times
remained
property
of
the
importer
in
his
warehouse,
in
the
original
form
in
which
imported.
and,
in
1827
this
court
held
in
brown
versus
maryland
in
chief
justice
marshall’s
landmark
decision
that
where
these
things
imported,
if
it
would
please
the
court,
remains
the
property
of
the
importer
in
his
warehouse
in
the
original
form
or
package
in
which
it
was
imported
and
“a
tax
upon
it
is
to
plainly
a
duty
on
imports
to
escape
the
prohibition
in
the
constitution.
references
to
the
term
“original
form”
are
found
in
many
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court.
and
we
suggest
that
the
plain
and
natural
meaning
of
those
words
is
that
where
an
article
is
imported
without
packaging,
holding
such
an
article
in
its
unaltered
original
form
in
which
imported,
is
equivalent
to
holding
a
packaged
import
in
the
original
package
in
which
it
was
imported,
and
that
is
the
meaning
that
has
been
given
to
these
words
by
the
courts
of
new
york,
florida,
and
north
carolina
and
those
decisions
are
cited
in
our
brief
and,
in
our
judgment,
was
the
meaning
intended
by
chief
justice
marshall.
here,
the
georgia
court
ignored
and
disregarded
the
words
“original
form”
completely.
they
treated
them
as
being
completely
meaningless
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
tax
officials
in
this
case
are
asking
this
court
to
do.
and,
we
suggest
respectfully
that
the
court
has
not
done
so
for
nearly
150
years
and
no
persuasive
reason
has
been
or
can
be
advanced
for
doing
so
at
this
time.
the
second
factor
that
we
rely
upon
is
what
we
call
the
final
destination
factor.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
tires
are
still
in
the
flow
of
import
distribution,
have
not
reached
their
final
destination,
the
importation
journey
has
not
definitely
ended
nor
have
the
tires
been
irrevocably
committed
to
the
use
for
which
they
were
imported
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
no
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
the
journey
would
end,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
opinion,
at
the
point
at
which
the
tires
had
reached
a
retail
selling
type
operation
where
they
were
to
be
sold
at
retail
for
local
consumption
at
the
point
of
final
destination.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
i
suppose
it
could,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
we
have
not
explored
that
possibility
at
this
point.
but
i
say
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
because,
one,
as
we
all
know
one
of
the
important
reasons
for
the
inclusion
of
the
import
clause
in
the
federal
constitution
was
a
desire
of
the
framers
to
prevent
taxation
by
a
seaboard
state
with
their
great
ports
of
entry
of
imported
goods
flowing
through
to
inland
states
and
that
was
plainly
stated
in
brown
versus
maryland
and
this
court
reaffirmed
it
in
the
1959
youngstown
decision
where
the
court
said
the
constitutional
design
was
to
immunize
imports
from
taxation
by
the
importing
states
and
all
others.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
arguments
that
a
general
ad
valorem
non-discriminatory
ad
valorem
tax
is
not
prohibited
by
the
import
clause
had
been
consistently
rejected
by
this
court
for
more
than
100
years.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
i
think
may
versus
new
orleans,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
was
purely
an
original
packaged
case.
i
think
it
is
premised
totally
upon
original
package.
the
court
held
that
the
wooden
creates
in
which
the
boxes
were
contained
were
the
original
package
and
when
they
were
broken,
the
importer
lost
his
immunity.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
gwinnett,
your
honor.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
may
i
answer
that
in
two
ways,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
i
would
point
out,
number
one,
that
gwinnett
county
does
receive
taxation
from
the
michelin
property
which
is
the
land
and
the
buildings
and
the
typewriters,
desks,
that
type
of
property.
ad
valorem
tax
is
paid
by
my
client
to
the
county.
no
exemption
is
claimed.
with
respect
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
question,
my
answer
is
no.
i
do
not
claim
that
gwinnett
county
is
entitled
to
tax
my
property
which
is
an
import
so
long
as
it
remains
an
import
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
the
constitution
prohibits
it
and
it
is
an
absolute
prohibition
contained
in
the
constitution
and
there
is,
but
one
exemption,
and
that
is
no
state
shall
without
the
consent
of
congress
lay
any
tax
upon
an
import
except
what
may
be
absolutely
necessary
to
inspect
its
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
well
it
does,
but
that
has
been
construed
to
include
a
general
ad
valorem
tax.
in
low
versus
austin
in
1872,
the
court
held
that
or
california
made
that
argument.
california
made
the
same
argument
again
in
1946
in
richfield
oil
and
the
court,
again,
rejected
it
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
where
he
said
that
it
would
entail
substantial
revision
of
the
language
of
the
import
clause
to
substitute
for
the
prohibition
against
any
tax
the
words
in
a
discriminatory
text.
and
so,
for
those
reasons,
i
respectfully
answer
your
honor’s
question
by
saying
that
no,
i
do
not
think
my
goods
should
be
required
to
bear
part
of
the
expense
of
protecting
the
property.
coming
back
now,
if
i
may,
for
a
moment
to
the
final
destination
factor,
we
submit
that
that
is
essential
and
vital
to
a
determination
of
whether
the
tires
are
still
in
the
flow
of
import
distribution,
and
are
therefore,
still
imports.
the
georgia
court
disregarded
this
fact
and
to
do
so
is
to
lose
sight
of
one
of
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
import
clause
and
the
issue
which
really
lies
at
the
very
heart
of
this
case
and
that
is,
if
it
please
the
court,
whether
the
tires
have
retained
their
distinctive
character
as
import.
and
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
case
to
demonstrate
this
than
this
court’s
decision
in
youngstown,
where
the
court
held
that
the
ore
and
lumber
there
involved
had
lost
their
distinctive
character
as
imports
and
in
so
doing,
the
court
gave
major
weight
to
two
factors.
one,
the
importation
journey
definitely
had
ended,
and
two,
the
articles
had
been
irrevocably
committed
to
use
in
manufacturing
at
the
point
of
final
destination.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
same
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
final
destination
factor
here
because
here,
in
short
contrast,
if
the
court
please,
to
the
facts
in
youngstown,
we
have
undisputed
evidence
which
shows,
first,
the
tires
are
imported
for
sale
and
sold
only
at
wholesale.
two,
they
flow
out
from
the
importer’s
warehouse
to
franchise
dealers
in
six
states
in
the
original
form
in
which
imported.
and
three,
it
is
such
dealers
who
sell
the
tires
at
retail
for
local
consumption
at
the
point
of
final
destination.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
under
those
circumstances,
while
the
tires
are
in
the
importer’s
warehouse,
they
have
neither
completed
their
import
journey
nor
have
they
been
irrevocably
committed
to
use
it
at
the
final
point
of
destination.
on
the
contrary,
they
are
in
the
language
of
chief
justice
tony,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
quote
a
brief
statement,
mr.
chief
justice,
“merely
intransitive
and
on
their
way
to
the
distant
cities,
villages,
and
country
for
which
they
are
destined
and
where
they
are
expected
to
be
used
and
consumed
and
for
the
supply
of
which
they
were
in
truth
imported.”
that
precise
language
from
the
license
cases
was
quoted
in
the
youngstown
decision,
in
1959
and
we
submit,
it
is
clearly
applicable
here
and
under
these
circumstances,
the
tires
fall
squarely
within
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
import
clause
and
clearly
retain
their
status
as
imports.
moving
along,
our
third
factor,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
the
importer’s
right
to
sell
its
goods,
free
from
local
taxation.
again,
we
are
referring
to
brown
versus
maryland.
it
plainly
held
that
one
who
had
imported
goods
for
the
purpose
of
selling
them
had,
by
payment
of
the
import
duty
to
the
united
states,
acquired
not
only
the
right
to
bring
the
goods
into
the
country,
but
also
the
right
to
sell
the
goods
free
from
local
taxation
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
--
in
their
original
form
or
package.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
well,
i
would
not
argue,
your
honor,
that
that
may
not
have
been
the
specific
holding
of
brown
versus
maryland,
but
that
certainly
is
the
interpretation
which
has
been
placed
upon
that
decision
by
this
court
for
almost
150
years.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
i
would
with
one
exception,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
if
the
article
which
has
been
imported
is
still
held
by
the
importer
in
its
original
form
or
package
in
which
imported.
but
if
the
importation
process
has
ended
and
the
article
is
being
exposed
to
sell
at
retail
for
local
consumption
at
the
point
of
final
destination,
it
may
well
be
that
when
such
a
case
comes
before
this
court,
that
the
court
would
hold,
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
it
is
still
in
original
form,
that
it
has
lost
its
distinctive
character
as
an
import
and
become
subject
to
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
well,
the
import
clause
prohibits
taxation
upon
any
imports.
the
way
the
wholesale
factor
comes
into
it
is
that
in
a
whole
sale
distribution
process,
the
goods
are
still
flowing
through.
they
have
not
reached
the
point
as
youngstown
said,
the
importation
has
not
definitely
ended.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
well
sir,
that
argument
can
be
made,
but
i
think
it
is
logical
to
assume
that
there
is
no
further
flow
through
once
a
tire
or
any
other
imported
article
reaches
a
retail
outlet
which
is
selling
to
local
customers.
i
can
see
there
may
be
an
instance
where
somebody
from
alabama
could
come
into
georgia
at
a
retail
tire
store
and
buy
a
set
of
tires
and
they
may
wind
up
in
alabama,
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
would
be
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
your
honor,
i
will
give
my
guesstimate.
i
think
it
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
$10,000
per
year.
the
counsel
for
the
county
could
probably
give
a
more
accurate
answer.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
if
michelin
were
the
importer,
do
i
understand
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
it
would
in
my
own
judgment,
mr.
justice
powell,
if
the
georgia
corporation
is
deemed
to
be
the
importer
because
chief
justice
marshall
said
the
property,
the
thing
imported,
while
remaining
the
property
of
the
importer
in
his
warehouse
in
the
original
form
or
package.
so,
if
your
question
includes
the
georgia
corporation,
which
you
suggest
as
the
importer
and
it
is
his
warehouse
and
everything
else
is
the
same,
yes,
sir,
my
answer
would
be
the
clause
would
apply.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
i
think
they
could,
mr.
justice
powell,
provided
that
the
goods
that
were
at
the
transit
had
stopped
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
as
you
are
obviously
aware,
this
court
has
again
for
100
years
made
distinctions
in
the
cases
involving
interstate
commerce
and
imports,
and
of
course,
we
all
know
the
reasons
for
that
because
the
import
clause
has
an
absolute
prohibition,
whereas
the
commerce
clause
is
nothing
but
the
power
to
regulate
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
no,
sir,
not
under
the
facts
in
this
record,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
well,
if
they
were
bought
from
that
warehouse,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
anything
--
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes,
it
is
conceivable,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
that
could
be
true
if
the
correct
facts
existed.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
because
there
are
still
in
the
flow.
maybe
i
misunderstood
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question.
i
think
i
have
answered
it.
i
agree
with
you.
my
final
point,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
i
did
not
finish
the
right
to
sell.
it
is
unquestioned
here
that
we
pay
the
4%
import
duty
and
we
say
that
by
so
doing,
we
acquire
the
right
not
only
to
import
the
tires,
but
to
sell
them
and
until
they
are
sold,
they
retain
their
status
as
imports.
and
the
final
factor
is
that
unpackaged
imports,
in
our
judgment,
should
not
be
accorded
a
lesser
degree
of
immunity
than
that
which
is
generally
recognized
for
packaged
imports
and
that
is
precisely
the
result
which
the
georgia
supreme
court
arrived
at.
and
in
so
doing,
we
think
that
it
violated
long-standing
and
fundamental
constitutional
prohibitions
because
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
import
clause
was
to
command
a
uniform
degree
of
immunity
for
all
imports
whether
packaged
or
unpackaged
and
unless
we
are
to
ignore
that
constitutional
command,
it
cannot
be
successfully
argued
that
unpackaged
imports
are
entitled
to
less
immunity
than
packaged
imports.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
to
respond
to
my
opponents.
thank
you.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
two
or
three
quick
comments.
number
one,
in
answer
to
your
question
that
you
posed
to
mr.
stephens,
the
record
shows
that
all
tires
in
the
warehouse
were
imported
and
none
had
sought
to
be
taxed
prior
to
the
first
taxable
year
here
involved.
mr.
earle
b.
may,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
are
photographs
which
are
part
of
the
original
record
in
this
case,
color
photographs
showing
the
form
in
which
the
tires
are
in
fact
delivered
to
the
importer’s
warehouse
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia.
exhibits
p2,
3,
and
4
to
the
record
of
those
photographs
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
mention
burke
versus
wells
which
mr.
stephens
mentioned,
as
we
read
it,
is
an
income
tax
case.
it
was
not
a
tax
on
imports
and
clearly
is
not
applicable
here.
i
would
like
to
conclude,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
by
saying
that
when
you
carefully
consider
all
of
the
arguments
raised
by
the
tax
officials,
the
result
sought
would
require
a
substantial
revision
of
the
language
of
the
import
clause
as
well
as
the
overruling
of
the
entire
brown
versus
maryland
line
of
decisions.
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
it
has
consistently
rejected
all
efforts
to
overrule
brown
versus
maryland
and
expressly
refused
to
undertake
revision
of
the
import
clause
in
richfield
oil
in
1946.
and
for
this
reason,
we
suggest,
that
these
arguments
should
not
be
urged
before
this
court,
but
before
the
only
branch
of
government
which
has
the
power
to
consent
to
the
state
taxation
of
imports
which
is
the
congress.
as
the
court
recognized
in
hooven
&
allison,
congress
has
the
power
to
lay
down
its
own
test
for
determining
when
immunity
is
and
unless
and
until
that
body
sees
fit
to
do
so,
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
continue
to
follow
the
test
which
it
has
consistently
applied
for
almost
150
years.
that
test,
in
our
judgment,
is
contained
in
the
brown
versus
maryland
lines
of
decisions.
those
decisions
reflect
what
we
believe
are
a
most
thorough
and
careful
consideration
of
what
the
framers
intended
when
they
originally
adapted
the
import
clause
and
we
believe
they
are
as
sound
today
as
they
were
when
originally
written.
accordingly,
we
respectfully
urge,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
such
decisions
be
followed
in
this
case
and
the
decision
of
the
georgia
court
reversed.
thank
you
very
much.
