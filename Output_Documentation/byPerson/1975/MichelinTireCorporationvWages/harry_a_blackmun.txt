well,
i
take
it,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
tubes
in
this
case,
are
we?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
if
you
lose
here,
your
client
can
start
packaging
its
tires
than
you
have
something?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
that
is
another
way
that
your
client
can
avoid
the
taxes
to
ship
directly
to
the
retailer
from
france
or
nova
scotia?
it
might
take
a
little
doing,
but
i
suppose
it
could
be
done.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
may,
it
is
of
no
import,
i
suppose
and
i
do
not
mean
that
as
a
pun
either,
but
how
much
tax
are
we
talking
about
here
annually,
roughly?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
same
principle
whether
it
is
$300
or
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
stephens,
is
this,
i
ask
as
i
always
do
in
ignorance,
is
the
fact
situation
here
somewhat
similar
to
what
i
have
seen
in
photographs
of
ships
coming
into
baltimore
loaded
with
vws
on
decks
and
they
are
not
wrapped.
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
something
in
savannah
comparable
to
that,
but
do
you
think
the
state
of
maryland
could
impose
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
those
automobiles
as
they
are
taken
off
the
ship
and
the
warehoused
there
in
baltimore?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
somewhat
comparable
to
that?
