you
are
arguing
your
third
point
which
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
importer
has
the
right
to
sell
in
this
country.
does
that
suggest
that
if
the
wholesaler
in
atlanta
had
been
an
american
wholesaler,
an
american
corporation,
and
michelin
had
sold
these
tires
to
it,
that
the
clause
would
not
apply?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
michelin
is
an
exporter,
michelin
in
france
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
makes
a
contract
to
sell
to
a
georgia
wholesaler,
just
take
this
warehouse.
assume
that
it
was
owned
by
a
georgia
corporation
and
everything
else
was
the
same,
would
the
clause
apply?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
that
there
must
be,
in
those
circumstances,
two
sales.
one
from
the
manufacturer
in
france
to
the
georgia
importer,
then
a
second
sale
by
the
georgia
importer,
say,
to
an
american
retailer?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
put
this
question.
it
may
not
be
entirely
relevant
but
i
would
be
interested
in
your
answer.
suppose
these
tires
had
been
manufactured
in
michigan
by
a
us
rubber
company,
for
example,
and
shipped
to
a
georgia
warehouse
and
handled
precisely
these
tires
were
handled.
under
the
commerce
clause,
could
georgia
validly
have
imposed
a
property
tax?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
is
exactly
the
same?
