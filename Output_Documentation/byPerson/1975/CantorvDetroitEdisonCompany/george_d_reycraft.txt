mr.
george
d.
reycraft
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
exception
of
the
treble
damages
which
the
petitioner
seeks
here,
all
the
relief
that
he
seeks
otherwise
is
available
to
him
from
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
he
conceded
during
his
oral
argue
to
be
for
judge
fiekens
that
it
may
will
be
theoretically,
at
least
the
michigan
public
service
commission
can
tell
detroit
edison
to
avoid
including
the
cost
of
light
bulbs
in
its
rate
pay,
based
for
purposes
of
determining
its
rates.
when
judge
fiekens
asked
him
whether
they
have
tried
to
invoke
the
procedures
at
michigan
public
service
commission,
he
admitted
that
it
was
a
crucial
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
lamp
exchange
program
came
within
the
jurisdiction,
but
he
conceded
that
he
have
not
approached
the
commission
at
all.
it
seems
to
us
that
judge
fiekens
was
reasonably
--
was
correct
in
his
opinion
when
he
said
that
certainly
the
anti-trust
court
should
not
step
in
when
the
commission
has
not
even
and
approached
by
the
plaintiff.
now,
the
petitioner
and
the
department
of
justice
both
seem
to
us
to
be
operating
under
what
we
believe
are
misconceptions
of
both
fact
and
law
and
the
way
the
regulatory
process
works
in
the
state
of
michigan.
the
commission's
most
recent
order
to
detroit
edison,
involving
the
lamp
supply
program
is
in
case
(u)
45
7d
which
is
dated
february
3,
1975.
the
opinion
and
or
of
the
commission
begins
with
the
language,
“therefore
it
is
ordered
that,”
it
goes
on
to
say
in
sub-paragraph
d,
“in
conformance
with
commission
order
number
d3096
filing
procedures,
the
detroit
edison
company
shall
promptly
file
with
the
commission,
rate
schedules
substantially
same
as
those
attached
hereto
as
exhibit
a.”
the
exhibit
a
which
is
referred
to
in
the
order,
includes
the
lamp
supply
program.
it
contains
the
following
language.
incandescent
lamps
will
be
furnished
without
extra
charge
(1)
to
residences
connected
for
the
first
time
to
the
company’s
lines
and
such
quantities
maybe
needed
for
all
permanent
fixtures,
(2)
as
replacements
of
approved
burned
out
lamps
in
proportion
to
the
use
of
energy
for
lighting
purposes
under
the
applicable
rate.
the
commission
then
went
on
to
say
“the
commission
specifically
reserves
jurisdiction
of
the
matters
herein
contained
and
the
authority
to
issue
to
such
further
order
or
orders
as
the
facts
and
circumstances
require.”
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
parker
v.
brown
says
that
when
am
agency
of
the
state
issues
a
command
to
a
private
entity
within
the
scope
of
its
authority
that
the
conduct
there
follows
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
is
necessary
for
us
at
least
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
test,
i
would
rather
say
that
the
test
is
what
parker
v.
brown
said
it
is
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
as
i
understood
what
he
said,
i
think
that
he
missed
--
that
he
over
read
parker
v.
brown
in
that,
he
appears
to
be
imposing
a
broader
test
upon
what
the
scope
of
the
legislative
command
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
mere
authorization,
we
are
not
arguing
that
mere
authorization
would
do
it
in
this
case.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
court
of
appeals
adapted
judge
fiekens'
opinion
which
had
before
it
all
of
these
orders
that
i
am
referring
to
which
commanded
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
what
it
said
was
that
the
district
court
had
correctly
applied
of
the
principles
of
parker
v.
brown
and
thereby
affirmed
it
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
believe
that
did
say
that
it
was
authorized,
but
it
did
refer
to
parker
v.
brown
which
of
course
is
narrow
within
their
authorization.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
district
judge,
i
believe
correctly
described
parker
v.
brown.
i
do
not
--
cannot
quote
it
verbatim,
but
i
believe
he
correctly
cited
parker
v.
brown.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
white,
no.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
think
acting
affirmatively
and
i
would
take
it
that
the
court
implies
that,
that
is
a
command
of
the
state
and
then
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
it
did
not
say,
use
the
word
command,
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
that
is
what
he
said
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well
but
if
the
fact
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
action,
however,
which
is
referred
to
is
in
fact
a
command
and
all
those
commands
were
before
the
district
court
and
were
in
the
record
which
the
court
of
appeals
considered.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
it
could
not
mr.
chief
justice.
it
could
not
have
altered
its
rates.
it
must
get
the
approval
of
the
commission
to
increase
or
decrease
it
rates.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
rate
structure
is
indeed
the
command
of
the
state.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
the
company
could
have
filed
the
tariff
which
did
not
include
light
bulb,
but
as
long
as
the
tariff
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
it
was
not
ordered
to
file
a
tariff,
it
is
conduct
is
and
the
analogy
is
to
that
in
parker
v.
brown
where
the
producer
has
voluntarily
petitioned
the
advisory
pro-rate
committee
for
a
particular
program.
it
was
not
commanded
to
file
a
tariff.
obviously,
it
seems
to
me
public
utility
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
law
is
460.6
which
is
of
course
is
a
broad
granted
jurisdiction
to
the
public
service
commission
to
completely
regulate
public
utilities
within
the
state,
including
electric
lightning
companies
and
the
all
the
services
that
they
provide
with
it.
there
is
of
course
no
specific
reference
to
light
bulbs
in
the
statute,
but
there
is
reference
to
electric
lighting
in
it
and
that
is
the
standard,
that
is
the
authority
under
which
the
public
service
commission
was
operating.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
am
not
--
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
correct
or
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
believe
that
the
practice
may
have
been
discontinued
at
the
end
of
an
effective
tariff.
in
other
words,
when
detroit
edison
went
in
to
file
the
new
tariff,
i
believe
to
that
particular
home
delivery
service
may
have
been
excluded,
but
that
occur
back
in
the
1930’s
and
i
cannot
say,
i
cannot
represent
to
this
court
that
it
was
terminated
before
or
only
after
the
new
tariff
became
effective,
but
that
is
my
belief.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no
sir,
that
is
not
alright.
that
does
not
provide
anti-trust
immunity
within
parker
v.
brown.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
if
it
is
optional
as
i
understand
the
court's
decision
parker
v.
brown
then
the
conduct
is
not
excluded
from
anti-trust
laws.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
another
of
decision
of
the
commission
in
1964
where
in
case
number
7091,
the
michigan
public
service
commission
specifically
reviewed
the
lamp
exchange
program.
at
the
time
it
was
unavailable
to
large
commercial
customers
and
detroit
edison
wanted
to
reduce
its
cost,
so
it
could
reduce
its
rates
and
it
did
go
into
the
commission
and
it
asked
for
permission
to
eliminate
the
lamp
supply
program
to
large
commercial
customers.
the
public
service
commission
did
permit
that
and
said
that
“lamp
replacements
of
approved
burnt
out
incandescent
lamps
will
continue
to
be
furnished
under
its
general
service
rate
which
applied
to
small
business”
and
it
also
require
it
to
continue
to
furnish
lamps
under
the
exchange
program
to
residential
customers.
so
not
only
did
they
consider
the
lamp
supply
program
in
1964,
but
it
exercise
the
discriminatory
judgment
as
to
which
parts
the
program
would
continue
and
which
parts
it
would
be
eliminated.
and
in
1964,
it
is
said,
“it
is
further
ordered
that
detroit
edison
shall
promptly
file
rate
sheets
to
be
effective
on
service
or
rendered
after
december
1,
1964”
and
that
included
the
residential
lamp
program.
and
at
that
time
they
reserved
jurisdiction
of
the
matter
and
the
authority
issued
further
orders
and
the
order
says
maybe
required
and
the
order
is
signed
by
each
of
the
commissioners
and
under
date
of
november
12,
1964.
there
are
have
been
18
orders
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission
and
its
predecessors
to
detroit
edison
since
1916.
the
michigan
public
service
commission
and
its
predecessors,
well,
state
regulation
of
the
utilities
begin
in
michigan
in
1909
and
till
1916,
detroit
edison
has
been
at
all
times
under
an
affirmative
order
to
continue
the
lamp
supply
program.
now,
the
petitioner
complains
that
there
has
not
been
any
trust
type
hearing
which
i
understand
is
the
nature
what
he
thinks
would
be
appropriate
in
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
well,
the
reason
for
that,
it
seems
to
be
that
no
one
has
ever
asked
for
such
a
hearing.
we
do
not
know
of
any
complaints
which
have
made
been
made
to
the
michigan
public
service
commission
about
the
lamp
supply
program.
i
would
not
say
that
someone
may
not
have
written
letter,
there
may
not
have
been
complaints,
but
we
do
not
know
about
it.
there
has
been
a
case
filed
in
the
state
court
in
michigan
which
the
petitioner
refers
to
on
its
brief,
it
is
the
rio
(ph)
case.
it
was
filed
in
1973
and
it
seeks
an
injunction
against
the
continuation
of
the
lamp
program.
we
have
not
mentioned
it
in
our
brief
for
which
i
apologize,
but
i
learned
over
the
recess
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
that
the
circuit
court
in
michigan
has
decided
that
case
and
they
dismissed
it
in
1974.
that
is
an
unreported
opinion
and
i
did
not
know
about
it
and
i
would
like
permission
to
furnish
a
copy
to
the
court.
it
decided
the
case,
dismissed
the
case
on
the
ground
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
because
the
michigan
public
service
commission
had
jurisdiction
over
the
lamp
supply
program
and
that
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
before
coming
into
even
the
state
circuit
court.
we
think
that
these
are
state
law
questions
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission
should,
in
the
first
place,
if
the
petitioner
thinks
that
they
do
not
have
jurisdiction,
he
should
argue
it
to
the
commission.
if
he
disagrees
with
the
conclusion
that
they
reached,
he
has
available
appeal
procedures
to
the
circuit
courts
in
michigan
and
if
he
disagrees
the
lamp,
he
can
go
to
the
michigan
supreme
court,
but
he
has
not
done
any
those
things.
he
simply
gone
into
the
anti
trust
court
and
tried
to
get
the
federal
courts
to
decide
what
are,
i
would
conceded
at
least
a
realistic
and
a
significant
questions
of
state
laws
as
to
extent
of
jurisdiction
to
the
public
service
commission.
he
conceded
before
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
do
not
believe
that
it
does
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
it
is
not
except
to
the
extent
that
i
do
not
know
that
jurisdiction
was
argued
in
parker
v.
brown,
but
here
petitioner
is
arguing
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
order
the
lamp
supply
program
in
effect
that
it
would
be
continued.
so
when
he
says
that,
he
is
bringing
into
this
case
a
state
law
question
which
i
do
not
know
was
raised
in
parker
v.
brown.
so,
i
think
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
would
on
its
own
initiative
start
an
anti
trust
type
hearing
on
a
light
bulb
exchange
program
which
has
been
in
effect
of
detroit
edison
and
its
predecessors
since
1885
and
it
is
been
under
orders
of
the
commission
since
1916.
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
facts
a
little
bit
while
i
know
that
the
court
does
not
want
to
get
in
too
much
details
of
the
fact.
it
seems
to
me
they
demonstrate
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission
continuing
to
order
the
lamp
exchange
program
and
the
reasonableness
of
it
is
not
initiating
nay
anti-trust
type
hearing
before
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
think
it
relates
to
the
question
whether
the
michigan
public
service
commission’s
procedures
were
adequate
and
whether
it
conducted
an
adequate
inquiry
into
detroit
edison’s
of
a
lamp
exchange
program.
for
example,
the
public
service
commission
has
had
the
rate
hearings
just
about
every
year
for
the
past
five
years,
they
had
it
in
1970,
1971,
1972,
1974
and
1975.
the
lamp
rate
here
involves
65
days
of
hearings
and
over
7500
page
of
transcript
about
lamp
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no
indeed,
there
are
devoted
to
all
phases
of
detroit
edison
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes
sir,
those
pages
are
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
they
were
not
--
i
would
not
say
that
they
get
to
the
level
of
an
anti-trust
trial
fortunately,
but
there
is
a
--
there
are
references
to
the
lamp
supply
program
in
that
hearing
and
they
are
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
but
i
think
the
important
point,
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
these
are
thorough
hearings,
the
rate
hearings
which
the
public
service
commission
conducts.
their
typical
practice
is
to
send
four
or
five
men
into
the
company
for
a
period
of
four
or
five
weeks.
they
review
every
cost
item
and
every
expense
on
the
company’s
books.
they
exclude
some
and
include
others.
the
cost
of
the
lamp
supply
program
is
specifically
included
in
an
account
as
it
is
required
to
be
under
the
michigan
law.
the
michigan
administrative
code
requires
these
costs
to
be
included
in
customer
installation
expense
which
is
where
they
are
included.
this
is
also
consistent
with
the
treatment
which
the
federal
power
commission
requires
and
has
required
since
1937.
so
that
there
is
not
any
mystery
about
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
lamp
supply
program
which
detroit
edison
has
had
in
effect
since
1885.
now,
my
friend
on
the
other
side
has
said
that
the
lamp
supply
program
has
made
detroit
edison
a
best
loved
utility
in
the
country
and
if
that
is
the
result
of
lamp
program
which
i
understood
as
what
he
was
saying,
it
seems
to
me
that
certainly
demonstrates
the
wide
spread
use
and
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
lamp
supply
program.
we
had
a
survey
conducted
some
years
ago
which
indicated
that
94%
of
our
customers
used
the
lamp
supply
program.
we
--
there
are
about
million
and
a
half
house
holds
in
the
detroit
edison’s
service
area
which
get
service
from
the
detroit.
now,
if
94%
of
them
used
the
lamp
supply
program,
it
is
hardly
any
secret
and
we
have
not
kept
it
a
secret
and
in
fact,
the
exhibit
which
the
petitioner’s
counsel
referred
to
in
the
appendix
which
shows
the
availability
of
the
different
size
of
light
bulbs,
demonstrates
that
this
program
is
well
publicized.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
that
is
an
alternative
ground
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
which
i
think
that
this
case
can
and
it
should
be
disposed
of.
where
there
is
an
available
state
procedure.
i
think
he
should
be
required
to
exhaust
it.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
closest
authority
is
there
is
the
richie
case
where
the
court
referred
an
anti-trust
plaintiff
to
the
commodity
exchange
authority
before
the
court
decided
the
anti-trust
law.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
right.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
agree.
there
was
a
federal
issue
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
yes.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
i
think
my
basic
point
is
that
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
the
command
which
indeed
the
michigan
public
service
commission
did
issue
was
outside
the
scope
were
their
authority.
i
mean,
the
ultra
virus,
as
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
it
and
i
think
determination
of
that
question
is
preliminary,
is
a
state
question
and
i
think
that
if
the
--
if
that
is
the
basis
of
his
argument
that
this
is
anti-trust
law.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
they
did
and
i
think
correctly.
i
had
started
to
talk
about
some
of
the
facts
to
show
the
reasonableness
of
the
exercise
about
a
public
service
commission
of
their
jurisdiction.
this
include
the
facts
that
the
cost
of
the
light
bulbs
were
passed
through
to
the
consumer
without
any
profit
or
any
mark
up
on
the
part
of
the
company,
that
is
required
by
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
now,
if
petitioner
argues
that
part
of
the
customer
service
offices
are
part
of
detroit
edison’s
rate
base,
and
that
therefore
there
maybe
some
element
of
those
facilities
in
detroit’s
profits.
the
fact
is,
that
these
customers
service
offices
perform
a
wide
variety
of
services
and
they
would
have
to
be
continued
even
if
the
lamp
exchange
program
was
discontinued.
detroit
edison’s
profits
are
allowed
as
a
percentage
of
its
rate
base.
the
current
percentage
allowed
is
8.7%
and
that
is
not
applied
in
any
way
to
the
cost
of
the
light
bulbs.
these
are
costs
passed
through
as
a
cost
of
service
and
are
included
in
the
customer’s
rate
base.
there
is
50
of
these
customers
service
centers
and
35
agents
who
distribute
the
bulbs.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
we
paid
in
1972
about
2
million
360
for
the
offices.
the
offices
do
not
cost
very
much
as
far
to
the
extent
to
which
they
are
allocated
or
devoted
to
the
lamp
supply
program.
they
would
have
to
be
there
in
any
event
for
such
things
as
customers
coming
in
to
talk
about
their
bills,
whether
they
have
the
proper
charge,
whether
some
special
installation
is
required
for
their
electric
light
hook
up.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
sir?
yes,
well,
in
detroit
you
could
send
somebody
down
to
the
customer
service
center
and
have
the
argument
there.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
my
argument
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
procedures
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
the
petitioner
has
complained
that
there
was
no
anti-trust
type
hearing
before
the
michigan
public
service
commission
and
the
fact
that
the
program
is
a
program
which
is
beneficial
to
the
public,
the
fact
that
it
does
not
return
a
profit
to
detroit
edison,
the
fact
that
the
cost
of
the
bulbs
is
far
below
what
the
consumer
could
get
the
bulbs
for
on
the
open
market,
all
explain
to
my
satisfaction
at
least,
why
the
michigan
public
service
commission
did
not
hold
and
extended
anti-trust
type
trial
which
is
what
the
petitioner
seems
to
be
asking
here.
in
1972
for
example,
there
are
18
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
that
may,
will
be.
that
maybe
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
i
think
what
were
--
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
i
think
that
if
the
program
became
optional,
i
am
not
sure
that
detroit
edison
would
apply
to
continue
the
program
and
its
tariffs
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
became
optional.
it
would
be
sufficiently
economical.
so
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
do
not
--
obviously
that
is
a
matter
in
the
future
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
think
it
is
very
likely
true,
yes,
very
likely
true.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
your
honor,
there
was
no
motion
for
a
class
determination
and
no
class
determination
has
been
made
and
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
the
petitioner
has
testified
in
this
case
that
he
sold
over
i
believe
it
was
two
or
three
years
period,
light
bulbs
with
a
retail
gross
value
of
about
a
$135.00.
he
also
testified
that
his
cost
with
those
bulbs
was
about
$90.00.
his
specific
price
for
bulb
for
a
hundred
watt
bulb
was
$00.21
and
he
sold
them
to
$00.32.
so,
i
literally
lost
my
point.
the
average
cost
of
the
bulbs
for
the
customers
in
detroit
area
in
1972
was
a
$1.80
through
the
detroit
edison
program
which
of
course
is
included
in
the
rate
base.
another
reason
why
we
are
able
to
furnish
light
bulbs
at
this
cost
is
because
detroit
edison
gets
competitive
bids
from
the
light
bulb
manufactures.
there
are
three
principle
manufacturers,
general
electric
westing
house
in
sylvania.
detroit
edison
puts
together
specifications
and
asks
for
bids
and
it
buys
from
the
manufacturer
which
submits
the
best
bid
and
these
savings
as
i
testified
are
passed
on
to
consumer.
in
addition
a
bulb
that
it
is
able
to
get
because
it
is
able
to
ask
for
competitive
of
bids
has
a
longer
life
than
the
generally
available
commercial
bulb.
the
average
bulb
--
the
average
life
of
a
hundred
watt
bulb
is
1,350
hours
whereas
the
generally
available
commercial
bulb
has
only
750
hours
of
light.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
there
are
at
least
three
in
michigan
who
do
have
lamp
supply
programs,
however,
and
i
want
to
take
it
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
do
not
believe
there
are
many
others
throughout
the
country
mr.
justice
white.
there
have
been
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
think
there
are
at
least
some
who
do
not
have
the
program,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
can
not
tell
you
that
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
they
are
free
not
to
have
it
only
because
their
tariff
--
the
tariff
is
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes,
in
the
first
instance
of
course
it
is
voluntary
action
on
the
part
of
the
utility.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
the
statute
does
not
say
that
electric
utility
shall
have
lamp
supply
program,
no,
it
does
not.
the
michigan
public
service
commission
is
a
agency
of
course
created
by
the
state
of
michigan
and
unlike
the
advisory
pro-rate
commission
in
parker
v.
brown,
it
does
not
consist
of
a
group
of
private
self
interested
persons
who
are
acting
in
a
quasi
governmental
capacity.
each
of
the
commissioners
is
appointed
for
a
term
of
six
years
by
the
governor
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
they
are
prohibited
from
having
any
pecuniary
interest
in
any
regulating
utility
during
the
time
that
they
are
on
the
commission.
they
pervasively
regulate
rates
in
michigan.
utility
can
increase
its
rates
directly
or
increase
its
rate
indirectly
by
reducing
service
and
that
would
include
eliminating
a
light
bulb
without
specific
permission
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
so
before
raising
rates
are
or
reducing
service,
they
need
the
approval
of
the
commission.
and
as
i
have
said
the
procedures
are
extensive,
65
days
of
hearings
in
the
last
rate
case
and
over
7,500
pages
of
testimony.
this
court
most
recently
considered
parker
v.
brown
issue
in
goldfarb
versus
virginia
state
bar
and
repeated
the
holding
that
when
private
conduct
is
required
by
the
state
acting
in
its
capacity
as
sovereign,
the
conduct
does
not
subject
to
the
federal
anti-trust
laws.
they
are
unlike
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
the
virginia
state
bar
was
only
a
state
agency
for
very
limited
purposes
and
certainly
it
was
not
under
any
command
from
the
virginia
state
supreme
court
to
have
fixed
minimum
prices
for
attorneys
offering
their
services.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
there
is
a
question
in
my
mind
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
question
in
my
mind
would
be
that
if
the
choice
is
between
continuing
the
lamp
supply
program
at
all
or
continuing
on
its
present
basis
because
of
it
is
more
economical
in
that
sense.
i
do
not
know
what
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
michigan
public
service
commission
could
say
to
detroit
edison,
we
are
going
to
require
you
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
they
can
say
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
they
can
say
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
by
their
general
authority
in
460.6
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no
sir.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
let
me
explain
my
answer
a
bit.
they
have
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
they
have
told
detroit
edison
company,
18
consecutive
times
since
1916
that
they
must
continue
the
lamp
supply
program.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no
sir,
they
said
you
are
ordered.
your
give
up
order
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
hear.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes
sir
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes
sir.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
they
said
it
18
consecutive
times
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes,
they
said
you
are
ordered.
they
said
that,
i
have
quoted
the
language
a
little
earlier,
they
said,
“it
is
hereby
ordered
that
the
detroit
edison
company
shall
promptly
file
rate
sheets
substantially
the
same
as
the
sheets
attached
hereto
as
exhibit
a
to
be
effective
on
service
rendered
on
and
after
december
1,
1964”
and
exhibit
a
includes
the
lamp
exchange
program.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
sir?
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
it
is
not
a
hundred,
it
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
it
is
a
paragraph
which
describes
a
lamp
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
not
under
our
existing
tariff
mr.
justice
marshall.
if
we
went
back
to
the
commission
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
the
commission
does
have
the
power
to
order
detroit
edison
to
continue
the
lamp
supply
program
as
it
exists,
to
make
it
optional
or
to
discontinue
it
all
together.
what
they
would
do
if
the
issue
were
presented
to
them
in
that
way,
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
i
know.
i
think
that
kind
of
a
proceeding
in
a
rate
proceeding
generally
requires
notice
throughout
detroit
edison’s
service
area,
so
that
their
wide
rights
of
intervention
and
the
appearance
of
witnesses
in
the
rate
proceeding,
so
that
consumers
could
come
in
and
say
we
want
it
this
way,
we
want
it
that
way
and
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
marshall
honestly
how
would
that
come
out,
but
the
present
case,
in
any
trust
case
it
is
simply
a
private
fight
between
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
if
i
understand
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
these
orders
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
used
the
precise
language
order.
they
use
it
on
a
number
occasions
and
that
to
my
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well
sir,
to
my
simple
mind
whether
it
is
out
of
a
form
book
or
not,
it
is
an
order
and
if
i
do
not
comply
with
it,
i
am
in
trouble
whether
it
is
a
court
or
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
that
of
course
is
what
happened
in
parker
v.
brown.
the
resin
producers
asked
the
pro-rate
commission
to
order
them
to
compel
price
fixing
effect
and
withdraw
a
substantial
amount
of
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
no,
we
are
asking
and
we
have
asked
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes,
we
did
that,
yes.
yes
we
did
that
and
we
have
done
it
since
1916
on
18
separate
occasions,
yes
sir.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
could
easily,
if
it
is
brought
to
its
attention,
taking
into
account
anti-trust
policy.
michigan
has
an
anti-trust
law,
so
the
anti-trust
laws
in
competition
or
the
state
policy
of
michigan
just
as
there
the
national
policy
of
the
united
states
under
federal
anti-trust
laws.
so
that
as
in
gulf
states'
utilities,
the
public
utility
can
be
the
first
line
of
defense
against
anti
competitive
practices
which
may
later
turn
out
to
be
anti-trust
violations,
so
that
the
petitioner
has
a
form
before
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
there
is
a
procedure
under
which
you
can
been
intervene.
you
could
appear
as
a
witness
and
there
is
a
separate
complaint
procedure
which
he
could
use,
if
he
really
wants
the
determination
as
to
whether
this
light
bulb
program
should
continue
rather
than
to
have
a
nice
lawsuit,
there
would
be
a
big
class
action
which
at
some
time
might
produce
treble
damages.
he
is
not
interested
in
any
of
the
lamp
supply
program.
what
he
is
interested
in
his
treble
damages
and
reasonable
attorney’s
fees.
so
we
submit
that
the
public
service
commission
did
clearly
issued
numerous
commands
to
detroit
edison.
they
did
result
from
voluntary
applications
on
the
part
of
detroit
edison
just
as
was
the
case
in
parker
v.
brown.
we
submit
that
that
conduct
is
within
parker
v.
brown
and
that
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
district
court
were
correct
in
their
determination.
