mr.
howard
j.
trienens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
a
group
of
michigan
utilities
who
locally
could
not
care
less
about
light
bulbs.
they
some
of
the
electric
companies
that
do
not
have
this
provision,
others
are
gas
and
telephone
companies.
our
concern
is
not
what
this
particular
tariff
or
the
provisions,
merits,
public
interest
anti-competitive
or
otherwise
features
of
it.
our
interest
is
in
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general
which
would
make
life
absolutely
impossible
for
a
utility
to
operate
and
would
be
grossly
unjust.
now,
let
me
use
as
an
illustration
the
point
that
just
been
discussed
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
do
not
think
it
makes
the
slightest
difference,
whether
utility
proposes
this
tariff,
whether
the
chairman
of
the
commission
drafts
it
or
the
speaker
of
the
house
drafts
it.
the
point
is
no
matter
who
submitted
this
tariff
if
the
utility
has
not
had
the
option.
if
detroit
edison
files
a
tariff
with
this
lamp
provision
in
it,
the
commission
can
take
it
out.
if
the
utility
files
a
tariff
with
the
provision
out,
the
michigan
can
put
it
back
in.
the
authority
for
that
is
under
the
pervasive
regulatory
statute
which
is
common
in
the
public
utility
regulatory
matters
wherein
addition
to
fixing
rates
the
commission
made
by
order
also
establish
such
rules
and
conditions
of
service
as
shall
be
just
and
reasonable.
you
are
absolutely
right
mr.
justice
marshall.
there
are
hundreds
of
these
conditions
and
service
and
these
tariffs
just
bristle
with
problems.
who
puts
the
meter
where
and
who
takes
the
pipe
how
far
in
and
who
pays
how
much
to
get
a
cable
put
in
a
subdivision.
these
are
just
full
of
problems
and
any
bristle
with
anti-trust
problems
and
this
is
just
one
of
them.
my
point
is
that
under
this
pervasive
regulation,
it
does
not
matter
who
wrote
the
first
draft.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
michigan
commission
is
the
one
who
decides
it.
now,
it
is
more
toward
the
mat
and
this
is
critical
and
that
something
i
hope
i
can
emphasize
enough.
the
standards
are
different.
under
parker
v.
brown
you
cannot
just
say,
let
us
forget
the
competition,
there
has
to
be
a
state
that
competition
is
displaced,
eliminated
or
subordinated
and
that
is
not
enough.
you
also
have
to
substitute
machinery
by
the
state.
the
state
imposes
its
views
of
what
the
proper
decision
is
under
the
other
standard
and
the
utility
feel
we
call
the
public
interest
standard.
now,
in
michigan,
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
in
a
case
affirmed
here
in
1951,
that
the
right
to
exclude
competition
where
the
general
public
convenience
and
necessities
so
require
has
been
delegated
by
the
legislature
to
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
the
standard
is
not
the
same
as
the
standard
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
am
arguing
this
case
because
the
question
here
is
really
one
of
standards.
the
question
here
is
the
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
am
arguing
about
this
case
because
the
whole
point
of
solicitor
generalâ€™s
argument.
i
am
arguing
as
the
amicus
on
exactly
the
same
plaint.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no
sir,
i
am
saying
they
do
not
have
to
and
that
that
is
irrelevant
because
the
statute
has
said
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said
in
connection
of
the
federal
statute,
referring
these
public
utilities
surely
it
cannot
be
said
that
competition
is
off
itself
a
national
policy
in
areas
like
public
utilities.
now,
that
is
shown
not
only,
that
is,
i
am
reading
from
fcc
v.
rca
communications
346
u.s.
92,
but
that
is
also
made
abundantly
plain
by
the
legislative
intent
shown
by
congress
in
that
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
he
is
referring
there
to
two
overseas
cables
as
to
whether
there
is
no
doubt
that
competition
was
favored
by
allowing
another
cable
to
come
in
and
he
said
there
is
more
to
it
than
that
and
that
competition
is
not
the
national
policy
the
be
all
and
end
all
when
you
are
dealing
with
these
regulatory
matters
where
it
is
pervasively
regulated
under
a
public
interest
standard.
now,
that
is
the
critical
distinction
here
because
there
has
been
a
different
standard
and
a
machinery
for
enforcing
that
standard
substituted
for
competition.
substituted
for
competition
and
that
is
what
this
public
utility
regulation
is
all
about
and
the
solicitor
general
speaks
of
a
trend.
he
says
there
is
be
a
trend
here
where,
as
he
would
put
it,
some
people
are
starting
to
use
mechanism
of
the
states
to
frustrate
national
policy.
now,
as
i
have
read,
the
national
policy
is
not,
and
i
emphasize
not,
to
impose
competition
as
part
of
the
standard
regulating
public
utilities,
it
is
simply
not.
and
the
federal
power
act,
the
federal
communications
act,
the
natural
gas
act,
all
use
a
public
inter
standard
and
most
importantly
here
leave
to
the
states,
leave
to
the
states
as
to
this
local
distribution
matters
like
detroit
edison,
the
question
of
their
regulations
under
their
public
interest
standard.
now,
if
you
go
to
the
federal
anti-trust
court
and
that
is
what
these
all
about,
whether
you
are
going
to
have
a
hearing
on
whether
these
light
bulbs
last
long
and
whether
they
are
good
or
bad
or
indifferent,
you
are
going
to
have
a
hearing
in
anti-trust
court,
that
is
what
these
people
want
and
may
be
that
the
petitioner
wants
treble
damage.
what
the
solicitor
general
wants
is
to
take
over
into
anti-trust
courts,
the
imposition
of
federal
anti-trust
standards
and
he
says
he
does
not
preempt,
but
he
preempts
in
practical
effect
by
imposing
federal
anti-trust
standards
through
the
federal
courts
on
the
states.
now
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
they
may
do
that.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
they
could
do
that
too
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
tell
you
where
it
would
stop.
i
will
tell
you
where
it
would
stop.
it
would
not
stop
in
my
view
because
the
federal
anti-trust
courts
started
trying
all
these
tariff
matters.
if
they
took
over
too
much,
beyond
the
traditional
public
utility
regulation
and
the
commission
did
that
which
i
doubt
and
the
state
court
affirmed
it
which
i
doubt,
this
court
still
sits
to
review
that.
if
there
is
a
commerce
clause
problem
or
due
process
problem
or
they
are
going
too
far,
this
court
says
you
do
not
make
every
tariff
issue
with
anti-trust
case
in
order
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
speculative
problem
that
is
not
before
us,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
that
under
the
--
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
that
while
he
would
say
they
do
not
preempt
that
he
has
suggested
to
you
this
morning
that
there
will
be
some
anti-trust
court
review
of
each
and
every
decision
of
that
kind
to
find
out
whether
they
have
stated
the
state
policy
precisely
enough.
now,
that
is
a
fine
business
for
the
federal
courts
to
be
in,
to
see
whether
these
agencies
of
each
state,
their
findings
precisely
enough,
whether
the
order
has
been
final
--
formal
enough,
whether
the
findings
are
adequate.
that
is
not
striking
as
the
business
of
the
federal
courts
either
on
the
territorial
allocation
or
on
any
one
of
the
hundreds
of
items
of
conditions
on
rates,
all
of
which
could
be
in
anti-trust
case.
if
you
really
wanted
to
--
excuse
me?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir.
yes
sir
i
am
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
otter
tail
was
a
case,
your
honor,
where
the
court
found
in
a
very
closely
divided
vote
four
to
three
and
i
can
see
the
problem
why
that
is
a
close
case,
that
the
federal
power
act
on
intrastate
was
not
pervasive
regulation,
that
is
what
both
opinions
said,
i
accept
that
finding,
and
therefore,
i
do
not
hear
challenge
otter
tail.
if
you
have
pervasive
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
south
eastern
underwriters
said
that
the
question
there
was
not
the
regulation
of
the
individual
insurance
company's
rates,
but
rather
the
insurance
companies
agreeing
among
themselves
in
a
rate
bureau
to
fix
rates
and
that
no
--
the
court
distinguished
parker
v.
brown
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
state
regulation
of
those
combinations.
there
was
no
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
think
it
scared
them
the
death
and
they
were
not
taking
any
chances.
i
would
--
if
they
go
to
a
hearing,
now
i
say
this
on
a
public
interest
standard,
if
they
go
to
a
hearing,
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
going
to
come
out
any
more
than
any
of
the
counsel
here
do,
but
the
public
service
commission,
michigan
would
have
the
hearing.
people
in
detroit
who
do
not
want
light
bulbs
to
come
to
that
hearing,
the
commission
would
decide
it.
they
would
either
knock
this
provision
out
or
change
it
as
they
did
in
(inaudible),
so
you
could
have
two
kinds
of
rates;
one
with
and
one
without
or
any
other
alternative.
the
point
is
it
would
be
decided
under
the
public
interest
standard
in
michigan
and
not
under
the
be
all
and
end
all
sole
aim
which
is
the
anti-trust
laws.
now,
i
am
not
here
arguing
that
these
utilities
in
michigan
are
engaged
in
a
state
action
any
more
than
the
resin
growers
in
parker
v.
brown
were
in
state
action.
what
i
am
saying
is
and
what
parker
v.
brown
means
is
that
where
the
state
defines
an
area,
defines
and
area
where
it
does
not
believe
that
the
state
interest
is
served,
the
public
interest
is
served
by
having
competition
be
the
sole
standard
and
that
is
not
enough.
where
they
also
substitute
regulatory
machinery
which
is
pervasive
then
that
does
displace
the
anti-trust
laws,
not
because
of
some
implied
immunity,
but
because
that
is
not
what
the
anti-trust
laws
meant,
that
is
not
what
they
have
meant
since
olsen
v.
smith
in
1904,
that
is
what
they
have
never
meant
and
what
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting
in
adding
to
this
business
to
the
federal
court
is
a
radical
departure,
if
it
has
merit,
i
say
does
not
economically,
but
if
it
has
merit
that
is
a
matter
for
congress.
there
is
a
raging
dispute
over
congress
about
deregulation
and
if
there
is
deregulation,
the
anti-trust
laws
come
in.
now,
you
can
argue
that
in
service
transportation,
you
can
argue
in
electricity,
all
i
am
saying
it
is
a
legislative
matter
in
parker
v.
brown
and
which
simply
construes
and
applies
the
sherman
act,
should
not
be
given
this
vast
extension.
this
is
a
matter
that
will
be
left
for
congress.
now,
there
is
a
fairness
question
here
too
and
that
is
what
i
like
to
--
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
i
say
that
is
a
schwegmann
and
it
is
not
permitted.
i
say
under
parker
v.
brown
it
is
much
closer
to
that
than
this
case
because
under
parker
v.
brown
whether
there
was
going
to
be
any
displacement
in
the
competition
depended
on
the
initiative
of
the
petitioning
resin
growers.
here,
it
does
not
depend
on
any
initiative
of
michigan
consolidated
gas
or
on
detroit
edison.
they
are
regulated,
their
rates
are
fixed
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
no,
is
the
commissionâ€™s
decision.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
but
why
should
they?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
what
i
mean
is
that
they
have
got
lots
to
do.
they
have
got
hundreds
of
these
tariff
provisions.
here
is
one
that
is
been
in
for
years
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
previously
it
was
there
when
the
commission
was
invented.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
detroit
edison
or
edison.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
could
who
take
it
out,
detroit
edison?
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
detroit
edison
could
file
a
tariff
which
in
effect
asks
for
relief
from
the
outstanding
order
and
ask
the
commission
to
relieve
them
of
doing
that
with
the
corresponding
rate
adjustment.
the
question
of
whether
they
got
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
and
some
other
have
another
alternative
where
they
are
ordered
to
keep
furnishing
and
if
the
customer
wants
them,
but
not
furnishing
if
the
customer
does
not.
there
is
also
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
state
policy
is
that
the
electric
companies
are
pervasively
regulated
and
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
rates,
what
service
is
provided
and
how
far
it
goes
and
who
maintains
what
is
to
be
decided
by
the
michigan
commission
in
the
public
interest
with
competition
not
being
the
be
alls
and
end
alls
or
would
be
under
the
anti-trust
laws.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
it
does
not
have
to
be
factor.
a
state
can
eliminate
or
subordinated
as
they
wish.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
all
of
them
on
face
of
the
statute
and
my
closing
comment
was
simply
that
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
and
they
submitted
to
commission
and
the
commission
found
it
was
in
the
public
interest
and
the
commission
let
them
do
it.
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
well,
now
there
is
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stevens
was
asking
about
--
mr.
howard
j.
trienens
the
answer,
i
do
not
believe
they
do.
i
do
not
believe
they
can
get
together
and
conspire
to
do.
i
think
they
have
to
make
their
own
judgment
on
what
they
think
is
in
a
public
interest,
make
their
draft
to
the
regulations,
submit
it
to
the
commission
and
whether
the
commission
lets
it
go
into
effect
or
not,
it
is
for
the
commission
to
decide
in
the
public
interest.
if
i
may
make
just
one
comment,
your
honor.
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
utility
itself,
to
subject
the
utility
to
two
duplicate
and
inconsistent
standards,
one
that
competition
is
so
lame,
the
other
the
public
interest
where
it
is
not,
is
impossible
position
to
put
a
utility
whether
the
commission
drafts
these
orders
or
whether
utility
counsel
proposes
them,
he
cannot
do
it
when
he
got
to
masters
and
if
it
just
is
basically
unfair
and
it
is
not
intended
by
the
sherman
act.
thank
you.
