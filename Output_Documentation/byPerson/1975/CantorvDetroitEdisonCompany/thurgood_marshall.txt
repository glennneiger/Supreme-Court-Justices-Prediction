justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
reycraft,
was
the
solicitor
general
correct
that
years
ago
they
stopped
going
to
the
homes
and
deliver
the
bulbs
and
did
not
change
the
tariff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
reycraft,
getting
back
to
michigan,
if
the
detroit
edison
are
going
to
need
decide
to
stop
dealing
in
light
bulbs,
did
so
and
filed
an
amended
tariff,
cutting
its
rates,
is
there
any
question
in
your
mind
that
it
would
be
approved?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
your
question
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
they
would
could
the
rates,
they
could
then
decide
the
rate
one
way
or
the
other,
but
that
is
all
they
would
do,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
they
say
you
must
continue
to
furnish
the
light
bulbs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
authority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
they
ever
told
anybody
in
michigan
that
they
had
to
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
they
have
never
done
it
before,
why
should
they
do
it
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
told
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
they
said
that
you
may
continue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
can
say
they
ordered
them
to
continue
the
light
bulbs
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
wanted
them
to
continue
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
to
give
light
bulb?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
they
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
ordered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
much
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
much
more?
the
light
bulb
is
about
a
hundred
other
items.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
just
one
of
a
whole
group
of
items?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
say
it
is
perfectly
honestly
that
detroit
edison
could
not
stop
furnishing
these
light
bulbs?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
they
furnish
another
tariff
which
takes
into
consideration
and
cuts
the
rates
that
much
that
the
commission
would
not
approve
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
real
trouble
is
that
agreeing
to
and
ordering
are
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
approving
and
ordering
are
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
stayed
out
of
a
form
book,
did
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
if
you
ask
somebody
to
order
you
to
do
something,
you
would
oblige,
you
would
agree
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
trienens,
the
commission
in
michigan
tells
the
(inaudible)
gas
company
in
the
michigan
that
you
must
furnish
light
bulbs
with
your
gas
--
with
your
electricity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
say
you
must
also
furnish
electric
stoves?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
would
it
stop?
could
they
go
to
make
it
automobile?
