of
not
accepting
not
additional
service?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
has
to
take
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
this
i
want
to
know
about,
these
bulbs
last
longer
than
the
ones
you
and
i
might
buy
from
mr.
cantor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
weinstein,
even
if,
i
gather
you
arguing
that
even
if
you
are
wrong
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
arguing
that
even
if
you
are
wrong
and
we
have
to
accept
what
this
michigan
judges
have
said
was
the
michigan
law
and
namely
that
the
commission
did
have
authority
to
approve
this
practice,
you
are
nevertheless
arguing
that
this
does
not
construe
a
state
command,
are
not
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
you
not
get
to
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
solicitor
general,
has
the
department
of
justice
ever
argued
federal
preemption
in
this
area?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
you
are
not
and
i
wondered
why
in
a
way?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
sounds
like
an
argument
to
me
that
it
does
not
cost
any
thing
because
it
is
there
is
anyway?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
have
heard
that
kind
of
argument
at
home?
