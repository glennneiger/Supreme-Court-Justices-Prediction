mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari,
granted
by
this
court
on
october
6,
1975,
from
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
six
circuit.
this
is
a
private,
treble
damage
action,
seeking
an
injunction
by
laurence
cantor.
mr.
cantor
is
a
retail
druggist
in
the
detroit
area,
who
sells
light
bulbs
or
lamps,
the
two
terms
can
be
used
interchangeably,
both
through
the
briefs
and
argument
here
in
competition
with
detroit
edison.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
the
technical
term
for
light
bulbs
is
lamps
and
they
have
been
use
interchangeably
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
it
is
not
a
floor
lamp,
your
honor,
no.
edison
is
an
investor
owned
private
electric
utility.
it
serves
a
large
area
of
south
eastern
michigan
and
secures
its
monopoly
as
an
electric
utility
via
a
franchise
granted
to
it
by
the
municipalities
in
which
it
serves.
the
gist
of
this
action
is
that
edison
via
its
monopoly
power
has
unlawfully
extended
this
monopoly
by
means
of
an
illegal
tie-in,
that
is
to
say
every
residential
customer
of
detroit
edison
must,
when
he
purchases
electrical
energy,
pay
a
price
included
and
charged
for
electrical
service
to
detroit
edison
for
lamps
or
light
bulbs.
it
does
not
make
a
difference
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
he
does
not
have
that
choice
at
all.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
no,
that
is
--
the
fact
that
makes
it
a
tie-in,
in
fact,
that
is
different
than
commercial
customers
who
do
not
have
that
program
at
all.
the
edison
is
unique
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
the
country,
they
are
the
only
electric
utility
company
that
continues
to
have
this
program
in
its
present
format.
edison’s
program
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
thomas
edison
in
1886
helped
device
the
program
before
regulation
even
begin
and
the
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
the
30’s,
many
regulatory
agencies,
many
courts
including
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
consumer
stores
case
said
that
this
was
a
monopolistic
practice,
it
was
unreasonable.
wisconsin
did
this
and
this
is
one
of
the
major
contentions
that
detroit
edison
is
the
only
one
doing
this
now,
after
everyone
else
is
decided
is
either
unreasonable
or
monopolistic
and
if
people
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
program
and
they
subsidize
others.
what
really
happens
here
and
you
have
to
know
physically
the
facts,
a
customer
of
edison
walks
in
with
some
burned
out
lamps
in
a
shopping
bag
and
he
goes
over
to
one
of
the
distribution
centers
where
these
bulbs
are
given
to
them.
there
is
a
list
of
bulbs
called
“approved”
bulbs
and
i
like
to
use
quotes
are
on
the
word
approved
because
the
only
approval
that
exists
here
for
this
list
of
bulbs
is
detroit
edison’s
list
of
bulbs
which
they
have
changed
from
time
to
time.
he
walks
in
with
these
bulbs,
he
picks
up
a
few
bulbs
that
he
needs
and
hands
in
the
burned
out
lamps.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
no,
your
honor.
edison
makes
a
point
to
the
fact
that
they
are
able
to
purchase
great
quantities
of
bulbs
because
they
can
(a)
deal
direct
with
the
manufacturer’s
large
quantity
discounts
and
there
is
a
vice
in
that,
your
honor,
because
within
the
very
service
centers,
they
sell
regular
light
bulbs
and
if
you
look
at
page
276
of
the
appendix,
this
is
a
point
of
purchase,
retail
advertisement
and
it
shows,
this
is
probably
stuck
in
a
bin
in
their
stores
and
it
says
these
lamps
available
for
free
exchange
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
yes,
your
honor.
these
lamps
are
available
for
free
exchange,
then
it
lists
an
entire
new
list
of
bulbs
that
are
not
part
of
the
program.
edison
sells
these
bulbs
at
a
regular
price
and
you
can
assume
that
if
they
are
able
to
get
such
a
great
deal
from
the
manufacturers
because
they
buy
a
such
large
quantities
of
this
bulbs
that
the
bulbs
that
are
sold
at
the
regular
price,
they
make
a
much
greater
profit
on
than
any
of
other
bulb
seller
in
detroit
edison.
the
program
is
carried
on
in
35
distribution
centers
within
the
service
area.
there
are
50
agents
selected
by
edison
at
their
own
whim
and
caprice
throughout
the
service
area,
who
also
are
able
to
give
these
bulbs
away
and
they
call
it
a
free
light
bulb
program.
the
fact
of
the
matter,
it
is
not
free,
the
fact
to
the
matter
it
is
not
an
exchange.
the
program
is
highly
promoted
in
detroit.
detroit
edison
is
the
best
loved
utility
in
the
country.
they
have
got
this
great
free
program
and
if
the
customers
knew
of
what
the
program
was
really
about,
i
would
begin
to
wonder
myself
whether
they
would
still
love
detroit
edison.
edison
it
self
justifies
this
program
by
keeping
the
sockets
filled.
they
want
the
lamps
are
lights
to
be
used.
they
also
--
this
also
brings
them
increased
revenue,
the
more
the
lights
are
used.
if
your
light
burns
out,
you
do
not
bother
about
getting
in
until
you
got
over
to
the
store
buy
some,
but
if
you
got
a
whole
supply
of
bulbs
in
your
house,
you
just
screw
another
bulb
in
the
place,
it
does
not
cost
you
anything
supposedly,
you
have
got
more
electricity,
more
light.
today
is
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
especially
when
you
take
in
to
consideration
that
these
are
longer
life
bulbs
and
now
that
is
a
great
pr
term,
longer
life
bulbs.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
yes,
they
do
last
longer,
but
they
are
more
in
efficient.
edison
in
its
brief,
i
believe
it
is
on
page
7,
admits
that
these
bulbs
are
8%
less
efficient
because
they
are
longer
life
and
they
sort
of,
at
last
part
of
their
life,
they
keep
on
giving
you
less
electricity.
so
if
you
and
this
really
an
insidious
device.
if
you
want
to
read
a
book
and
you
need
a
60
watt
bulb
read
that
book
and
if
it
is
in
the
last
hundred
hours
of
the
longer
life
bulb,
you
might
need
two
of
those
bulbs.
so
you
got
more
electricity
going.
you
are
burning
up
more
electricity
and
you
are
increasing
detroit
edison’s
revenues.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
other
issue
in
this
case
whatsoever.
the
customer
satisfaction
issue
has
been
raised
here
for
the
first
time.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
an
issue
because
in
the
trial
court,
a
stipulation
was
entered
into,
after
edison
filed
an
answer
and
there
was
a
lot
of
discovery.
we
stipulated
that
the
only
issue
for
summary
judgment
would
be
whether
or
not
this
program
received
justification
to
be
shielded
or
exempt
from
our
anti-trust
laws
because
of
the
doctrine
of
parker
versus
brown.
and
we
submit
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
(mpsc)
which
is
the
regulatory
agency
in
michigan,
neither
had
the
authority
to
approve
this
program
within
the
doctrine
espoused
by
parker
versus
brown
and
also
if
the
authority
here
is
granted
just
for
the
sake
of
this
argument,
we
do
not
believe
edison’s
program
was
regulated
in
the
manner
in
which
to
grant
them
an
exemption
from
our
anti-trust
laws
which
this
congresses
said
is
the
--
which
this
court
said
is
the
magna
carta
of
economic
freedom
in
this
country.
i
would
like
to
go
into
this
michigan
analysis
of
what
michigan
has
done
with
the
authority
question
because
that
is
the
best
way
to
analyze
whether
not
there
is
authority
here.
remember
i
said
that
the
way
to
determine
--
we
feel
there
is
two
questions.
did
the
michigan
public
service
commission
have
the
authority
to
regulate
and
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
they
did
have
the
authority,
did
they
regulate?
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
you
see
the
michigan
public
service
commission
is
stringently
limited
in
its
authority
here.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
contrary,
the
michigan
public
service
commission,
in
a
case
we
have
submitted
in
a
type
written
brief
due
to
the
delay
here,
in
1937,
it
is
mccray
versus
detroit
gas
i
believe
and
it
is
cited
in
our
type
written
brief,
but
the
cite
to
it
is
24-por-225.
in
that
case,
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
wayne
county
in
1937,
asked
the
michigan
regulatory
agency
there,
a
successor
to
the
regulatory
agency
which
exists
today,
they
asked
them
to
investigate
monopolistic
practices
and
schemes
engaged
in
by
detroit
edison
and
the
michigan
public
service
commission
or
at
that
time
it
was
called
“the
michigan
public
utilities
commission,”
stated
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
order
of
the
mpsc
there,
“that
it
is
without
jurisdiction
to
investigate
the
acts,
practices,
devices
and
schemes
under
which
the
present
rates
were
established
in
order
to
consider
and
report
how
such
evils
maybe
remedied.”
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
also
true.
it
is
unlike
some
federal
statute
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
exactly
right.
in
other
case
that
describes
this,
your
honor,
is
the
huron
portland
cement
case
and
in
that
particular
case,
huron
portland
cement
asked
the
michigan
public
service
commission
to
force
a
utility
render
service
to
them
and
as
justification
for
that,
they
cited
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
statute,
it
is
in
our
appendix
at
page
5,
it
is
section
460.6
and
in
460.6,
it
appears
to
be
and
i
say
appears
to
be,
a
grant
of
complete
power,
but
then
in
the
huron
portland
cement
case
which
a
michigan
supreme
court
case,
the
michigan
supreme
court
said,
that
this
is
just
a
mere
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
utilities
in
order
to
determine
what
the
michigan
public
service
commission
can
do,
what
authority
it
has,
you
must
look
to
the
other
statutes.
and
the
statute
that
they
refer
you
to
for
electric
utilities
in
the
huron
portland
cement
case
is
called
“the
transmission
of
electricity
act”
which
is
also
part
of
our
appendix
and
it
is
at
page
9.
those
two
sections
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
appendix
and
they
are
460,
now
when
i
say
460,
i
mean
the
chapter
in
which
they
talk
about
utilities
generally.
552
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
the
contention
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
talks
about
just
the
meat
and
potatoes
of
rates,
the
cost
to
the
consumer.
they
have
a
two-fold
duty.
they
have
a
duty
to
see
that
the
rate
is
reasonable.
they
have
got
another
duty
to
see
that
the
investor
in
the
company
gets
a
fair
rate
of
return.
they
have
nothing
further
to
do.
they
talk
about
conditions
of
services
and
those
services
refer
basically
to
the
transmission
of
this
electric
service.
in
fact,
detroit
edison
knows
very
well
what
it
means
by
service.
it
describes
the
term
service
in
it
is
rate
book
which
was
attached
to
the
defendant’s
response
in
our
motion
--
in
their
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
in
four
different
places,
they
talked
about
character
of
service
and
each
time
they
talk
about
it,
they
talk
about
it
as
alternating
current
service,
primary
high
voltage
service.
so,
they
are
only
talking
when
they
discuss
service
here,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rate
was
fair
and
that
is
the
cost
of
electrical
service.
remember,
you
know
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
able
to
express
because
the
lamp
or
the
light
as
such
seems
to
be
an
integral
part
of
this
thing
that
we
call
light
appear,
but
it
really
it
is
another
commodity.
it
is
a
product
like
a
refrigerator.
if
that
is
not
tied-in
to
the
sale
of
refrigerators,
it
would
be
a
more
obvious
situation
here,
but
we
do
not
have
that.
we
have
a
little
innocuous
thing
called
the
lamp
or
light
bulb.
this
light
bulb
being
a
product
is
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
detroit
--
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission
to
regulate
that.
the
constitution
in
michigan,
i
understand
this
goes
back
to
years
ago,
when
the
farmers
in
the
upper
peninsula
were
complaining
about
the
setting
of
range
breaks
down
in
lancing
and
they
wanted
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
rate
making
process
and
the
constitution
says
that
the
municipalities
will
reserve
to
themselves
jurisdiction
over
the
streets
and
alleys
and
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
does
not
grant
the
monopoly.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
absolutely
not
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
no,
your
honor,
i
am
asking
you
to
follow
the
michigan
law.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
did
not
do
anything
in
this
program
because
they
did
not
have
a
job
to
do.
they
knew
their
job.
this
is
no
attack
on
the
regulatory
agency
here
at
all.
michigan
public
service
commission
knew
they
could
regulate
light
bulbs.
they
did
not
do
so
and
that
is
a
second
point
of
my
argument
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record,
indicating
any
regulation
by
the
michigan
public
service
commission
to
bring
it
within
the
ambit
of
a
shield
from
the
anti-trust
laws.
if
you
examine
the
record
and
it
is
extensive
here,
there
are
many,
many
things
that
they
did
not
regulate.
now,
i
admitted
to
this
court
that
i
am
sort
of
back-dooring
the
situation.
i
have
a
difficult
case
before
me
i
admit
that
because
i
cannot
prove
the
lack
of
existence
of
something.
i
can
only
show
you
what
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
am
sorry,
i
could
not
hear
you.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
the
parker
versus
brown
case
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
the
only
issue
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
alright,
i
have
been
--
i
believe
that
without
authority
to
regulate
the
program,
without
an
interest
in
the
state,
there
is
no
statute
in
michigan
mentioning
approved
lamp
sales
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
very
well,
your
honor.
for
the
sake
of
this
argument
i
will
concede
that
point
that
they
did
have
authority
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
okay,
assume
it
arguendo,
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
show
that
they
did
regulate
this
program
and
the
only
way
i
can
show
you,
how
they
did
not
regulate
this
program
is
to
show
you
what
they
have
not
regulated
and
what
they
--
and
what
detroit
edison
has
not
chosen
to
reveal
to
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
remember,
this
is
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
the
fact
should
be
looked
at
in
the
best
of
light
to
the
person
opposing
that
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
the
most
revealing
fact
again
is
that
there
is
no
evidence.
if
there
was
evidence
of
considered
judgment
in
the
kind
of
regulation
that
would
exempt
an
anti-trust
the
activity,
detroit
edison
would
certainly
be
the
first
one
to
bring
it
to
this
court's
attention
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
there
has
been
no
state
(voice
overlap)
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
well,
i
have
been
trying
--
i
thought
i
was
going
to
prove
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
if
there
was
that
type
of
legislation
by
the
state
legislature,
evidencing
a
state
wide
interest
in
the
sale
of
light
bulb,
it
was
akin
to
the
state
wide
interest
in
agricultural
commodities
under
parker
versus
brown
then
i
would
say
to
you
there
could
be,
there
would
be
state
action
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
they
would
trouble
me
because
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
foist
those
types
of
commodities
on
the
consumer.
remember
the
consumer
has
no
choice
here.
he
has
got
to
take
those
light
bulbs.
a
light
bulb
is
a
commodity
like
salt,
we
all
need
it.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
do
not
believe,
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
believe
that
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
this
court
has
addressed
to
itself
to
a
position,
both
in
the
continental
ore
case
where
there
is
an
assertion
made
by
union
carbide
that
their
subsidiary
was
directed
to
preclude
the
continental
from
the
vanadium
market
and
this
court
said
that,
that
was
not
state
action
because
certainly
the
canadian
government
went
to
prove
this
thing.
also
in
the
schwegmann
case
there
was
a
situation
where
in
the
fair
price
area,
fair
traded
prices,
there
was
a
louisiana
statute
that
was
enacted
saying
that
non-signers
shall
be
bound
and
this
court
by
justice
douglas
said
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
anti-trust
laws
and
i
believe
that
lamps
fly
in
the
face
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
i
believe
refrigerators
most
certainly
fly
in
the
face
of
the
anti-trust
laws
here
as
well.
the
tie-in
contract
is
so
venal,
the
program
itself
is
so
venal
in
that
it
is
only
purpose
is
to
increase
the
revenues.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
in
late
early
30’s
in
the
nebula
case
in
new
york,
there
was
that
situation,
but
in
that
situation,
there
was
ruinous
competition
in
milk.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
believe
that
in
my
case,
since
detroit
edison
is
the
only
private
utility
that
does
this
program,
there
is
no
state
interest.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
understand
the
question
a
little
bit
better
now.
you
are
talking
about
prices.
now,
if
the
state
is
interested
in
the
rate,
we
have
no
quarrel
here
with
the
rate
that
detroit
edison
charges
here.
we
only
have
a
quarrel
with
the
method
by
which
they
tie
the
lamps
into
the
sale
of
electricity.
the
program
has
not
been
regulated.
they
have
advertised
this
program
as
free.
they
have
never
submitted
anything
to
detroit
--
to
the
michigan
public
service
commission
seeking
approval.
in
1954,
detroit
edison
on
its
own,
again,
without
going
back
to
the
regulatory
agency,
stopped
home
delivery.
there
has
been
no
regulation
of
the
other
bulbs
that
they
sell
when
i
address
myself
to
page
275
of
the
appendix.
there
is
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
investigated
the
competitive
effect,
the
anti
competitive
effect
of
this
program.
there
is
a
survey
made
by
an
independent
company
in
the
appendix
at
page
290
and
that
tells
you
what
the
program
is
really
all
about
on
page
292
and
what
they
have
really
tried
to
do
here.
and
since
they
have
--
we
believe
that
the
free
and
they
did
not
understand
the
program
themselves.
lamp
renewal
policy
helps
raise
the
wattage
on
lamps
used,
thus
giving
better
lighting
service
to
the
public
and
resulting
in
lighting
revenues
to
the
detroit
edison
company,
considerably
above
the
average.
now,
this
program
has
a
lot
of
aspects
to
it
to,
the
longer
life
aspect
to
it
of
the
bulbs,
also
means
that
revenues
of
the
detroit
edison
go
up.
another
aspect
of
the
program
and
all
of
these
facts
which
are
more
fully
set
out
in
the
facts
in
our
brief
have
never
been
subjected
to
the
regulation
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
it
similar
to
--
if
this
was
a
gas
company
involved
here
that
the
gas
utility
company
says
you
have
to
run
all
your
furnaces
at
75
degrees,
forget
about
energy
conservation,
forget
about
those
things,
in
order
to
get
our
gas
you
got
to
run
it
at
75
degrees.
that
is
the
same
thing
as
using
these
longer
life
bulbs.
they
want
to
keep
the
sockets
full.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
time.
i
just
want
to
conclude
by
saying
that
there
were
two
questions,
i
thought
i
would
address
myself
to
in
the
beginning
and
those
two
questions
are
did
this
authority
--
did
the
michigan
public
service
commission
have
the
authority
to
regulate
and
the
answer
to
that
question
we
believe
hardly
is
no.
even
if
it
did
have
authority,
it
did
not
do
so
and
without
authority,
there
was
no
compulsion
by
the
state.
there
was
no
acting
by
the
state.
this
entire
program
was
begun,
created
and
initiated
by
detroit
edison.
they
have
done
this
by
themselves
and
they
should
have
to
suffer
for
the
risks
involved
in
doing
this.
they
certainly
did
not
have
their
heads
in
the
sands
in
the
1930’s
when
other
companies
knew
that
this
program
was
unreasonable
and
monopolistic,
thank
you.
i
have
one
request
your
honor.
due
to
the
fact
that
we
received
the
two
briefs
from
the
amicus
on
january
5th,
we
would
like
to
have
the
leave
of
court
to
file
a
response
to
the
amicus
briefs.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
a
week
i
think
would
be
fine.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
i
hope
i
do
not
use
all
of
it,
your
honor.
the
existence
of
a
state
remedy
is
no
bar
to
a
federal
remedy
here
because
there
is
no
reason
to
require
us
to
go
back
to
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
in
fact
in
the
briefs,
i
do
not
believe
they
have
given
any
substantial
reason
why
we
can
go
back
there.
simply
there
is
no
command
here
by
the
state.
the
npsc
will
command
whatever
the
company
asks
and
that
is
even
show
them
--
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
the
record
does
not
show
that.
the
michigan
public
service
commission
will
do
what
the
utility
wants.
the
company
would
at
most
just
have
to
file
a
new
tariff
and
lower
the
rates
and
it
could
drop
the
light
bulb,
drop
the
light
bulb
program.
mr.
burton
i.
weinstein
thank
you
very
much.
