justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
did
they
have
the
authority
to
regulate
under
michigan
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
presumably
the
michigan
public
service
company
has
decided
that
had
that
authority,
judge
fiekens
who
is
a
michigan
lawyer,
sitting
on
the
bench
in
detroit,
ruled
against
you
in
the
sixth
circuit
which
handles
a
lot
of
michigan
cases,
likewise
ruled
against
you.
you
would
not
ask
this
court
to
super
impose
a
judgment
of
michigan
law
against
them,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
your
point
than,
is
not
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
did
not
have
the
authority
to
approve
detroit
edison’s
plan,
but
that
it
has
no
authority
to
investigate
the
monopolistic
implications
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
is
also
true,
but
is
your
part
of
your
contention
that
the
michigan
public
service
commission
had
no
authority
to
approve
detroit
edison’s
light
bulb
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
summarize
at
all
the
contention
you
are
trying
to
make
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
then
that
the
commission
was
not
authorized
to
approve
detroit
edison’s
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
seems,
you
got
these
real
hurdles
to
overcome
in
that
you
have
the
district
judge
is
a
michigan
lawyer
in
the
sixth
circuit,
as
well
as
the
public
service
commission
saying
they
did
have
that
power.
you
are
asking
us
to
super
impose
our
judgment
of
michigan
law
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
parker
against
brown
the
initiative
came
from
the
growers
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
had
to
be
initiated
by
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
us
assume
that
parker
against
brown
is
the
limit
of
the
governmental
immunity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reycraft,
are
you
arguing
that
the
plaintiff
before
he
can
prosecute
in
the
federal
anti-trust
sued
has
to
exhaust
procedures
before
a
state
agency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
authority
at
least
from
this
court
for
that
proposition,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
you
are
dealing
with
two
acts
of
congress
really?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
rates
could
be
entirely
reasonable
and
that
would
not
be
a
defense
to
an
anti-trust
(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
trienens.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
my
hometown
at
phoenix,
there
are
two
utilities,
both
serving
the
same
general
area
and
there
is,
as
i
understand
a
conscious
policy
of
division
of
territory
which
is
approved
by
the
arizona
corporation
commission.
now,
do
you
understand
under
the
solicitor
general’s
theory
that
because
the
two
utilities
agree
that
they
should
be
ordered
to
do
that
by
the
utility
commission
that,
that
territory
allocation
would
be
actionable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
state
in
effect
that
all
of
the
michigan
utilities,
the
ones
that
furnish
light
bulbs
and
those
that
do
not,
are
subjected
to
the
same
pervasive
regulatory?
