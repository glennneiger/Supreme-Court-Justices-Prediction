before
you
leave
that
--
before
you
get
to
that
part
of
your
argument
--[laughter]
may
i
ask
this
question?
assume
that
the
legislature
of
mississippi
had
adapted
the
statute
directing
electric
utilities
in
the
state
to
include
this
service
as
a
part
of
that
service
to
the
public,
what
would
be
your
response
to
that
sort
of
legislation
be?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
the
legislation
went
a
bit
further
and
directed
the
utilities
to
provide
electric
refrigerators,
electric
stoves,
electric
dishwashers
and
other
designated
appliances,
would
that
trouble
you
any?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
this
case
stands
on
whether
not
the
state
has
directed
something,
why
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
lamps
and
refrigerators?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
under
parker,
this
case
before
us
today
must
stand
on
whether
or
not
the
state
has
directed
the
utility
to
do
this.
if
that
is
an
issue,
what
different
would
it
make
whether
the
state
directed
that
utility
provide
lamp
bulbs
or
electric
refrigerators?
