justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
defendant
could
abandon
the
policy
without
the
approval
of
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
just
ask
just
one
question
on
your
point
that
the
jackson
case
would
be
dispositive.
i
suppose
one
could
distinguish
one
thought,
this
was
a
command
and
the
other
was
merely
a
permission,
that
it
is
different
state
programs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
parker
against
brown
issue
which
i
understand
to
be
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
the
district
court
turn
it
all
on
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
has
exhausted
his
state
administrative
remedies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
really
it
is
not
before
us,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reycraft,
does
the
reasonableness
of
the
program
relate
to
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
law,
but
would
it
relate
to
the
question
whether
parker
against
brown
applies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
about
how
many
of
those
pages
were
devoted
to
the
lamp
supply
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
any
of
those
pages
devoted
to
the
lamp
supply
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
mr.
reycraft
your
analysis
of
the
facts
is
correct
and
of
course
summary
judgment,
i
guess
we
have
to
take
your
opponent's
version,
whether
it
is
a
dispute,
if
your
analysis
is
correct,
you
have
demonstrated
that
giving
the
customers
an
option
they
would
still
take
the
free
light
bulbs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
we
were
really
just
fighting
about
whether
it
should
be
optional
or
mandatory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
not
there
be
the
same
number
of
people
who
would
take
the
light
bulbs,
if
it
is
such
a
bargain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
premises
are
correct,
you
would
think
the
conclusion
would
follow
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
another
procedural
question
while
interrupted
you?
was
there
a
class
determination
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
make
sure
i
just
understand
your
theory.
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
asking
for
a
complete
exemption
from
the
anti-trust
laws
for
any
industry
that
is
subjected
to
state
regulation
that
follows
the
different
standard
and
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
you
do
with
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
mcgovern
amendment
was
unnecessary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
just
one
question?
does
the
record
show
that
there
are
other
michigan
public
utilities
that
do
not
have
lamp
programs
or
that
have
optional
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
a
anti-trust
case.
a
druggist
who
sells
light
bulbs
in
retail,
brought
suit
against
the
detroit
edison
co.
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
alleging
that
the
utility
is
using
it's
monopoly
over
the
distribution
of
electricity
to
restrain
competition
in
the
sale
of
light
bulbs.
since
1886,
the
company
has
provided
it's
customers
with
limited
amounts
of
light
bulbs
at
no
charge
other
than
it's
charge
for
electric
service.
since
1916,
this
practice
has
been
described
in
tariffs,
which
the
utility
has
periodically
filed
with
the
michigan
public
service
commission
and
the
commission's
approval
of
each
of
those
tariffs
has
had
the
effect
of
requiring
the
utility
to
continue
the
light
bulb
distribution
program
until
it's
next
tariff
is
filed
and
approved.
the
utility
as
the
solo
supplier
of
electricity
to
about
5
million
people
in
south
eastern
michigan
and
distributes
about
50
percent
of
the
standard
size
light
bulbs
used
by
those
consumers.
the
district
court
held
that
since
the
program
had
been
approved
by
the
state
commission
and
since
the
approval
of
a
tariff
filed
by
a
utility,
required
the
company
to
maintain
the
program
until
another
tariff
was
filed
and
approved,
it
was
exempted
from
the
federal
anti-trust
laws.
accordingly,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
defendant.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
in
which
i
speak
for
the
court
in
parts
1
and
3
and
for
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
in
parts
2
and
4,
we
first
note
that
only
one
question
is
before
us,
whether
the
program
is
exempt
from
anti-trust
laws
by
reason
of
the
state
commission's
approval.
we
do
not
decide
whether
the
program
is
unlawful
or
whether
if
so,
the
retail
druggist
to
brought
this
action
or
anyone
else
has
any
right
to
recover
damages.
we
know
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
other
utility
in
michigan
follows
a
program
which
requires
every
customer
to
pay
the
same
charge
for
electricity
whether
or
not
he
receives
his
light
bulbs
from
the
power
company.
that
there
is
no
state
wide
policy
requiring
or
even
favoring
such
programs
and
that
the
market
for
light
bulbs
as
opposed
to
the
market
for
electricity
is
essentially
unregulated.
we
then
note,
that
the
choice
to
have
or
not
to
have
a
program
such
as
this
is
essentially
a
matter
for
the
utility
to
decide
for
itself,
subject
only
to
the
state
commission's
approval.
finally,
we
point
out
that
if
the
fact
that
the
program
has
been
approved
by
a
state
commission
and
that
it
must
therefore
be
maintained
until
the
utility
files
a
new
tariff
is
a
sufficient
reason
to
confer
immunity
and
the
utility.
a
large
number
of
state
agencies
would
have
much
broader
power
to
grant
exemptions
from
the
federal
anti-trust
laws
than
even
federal
agencies
here.
for
essentially
these
reasons,
the
court
holds
that
responded
is
not
exempt
from
the
federal
anti-trust
laws
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
