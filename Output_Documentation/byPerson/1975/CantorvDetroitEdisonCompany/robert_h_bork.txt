mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
here
as
amicus
curiae
in
support
of
the
petitioner
because
any
rule
announced
in
this
case
will
heavily
affect
the
government’s
enforcement
policy.
this
relatively
new
field
of
anti-trust
enforcement
and
it
is
that
way
because
there
has
been
modern
proliferation
of
regulatory
agencies,
licensing
agencies
and
so
forth
at
the
state
and
local
levels
which
offer
ever
increasing
opportunity
for
quite
sophisticated
businesses
to
get
anti-competitive
policies
immunized
in
some
way
by
regulation
or
appear
to
be
immunized
in
some
way
by
the
regulation.
and
we
think
it
is
quite
important
to
the
federal
anti-trust
policy
that
any
immunity
that
it
is
granted
be
one
that
arises
because
there
is
a
deliberate
and
affirmative
regulatory
policy
of
a
state
to
command
the
activity
which
is
questioned.
and
we
think
here
that
if
the
position
or
the
doctrine
espoused
by
detroit
edison
becomes
the
law,
then
the
immunity
of
parker
against
brown
will
be
expanded
and
will
in
fact
shield
anti
competitive
conduct
that
no
state
particularly
wants
and
certainly
that
no
state
requires.
now,
i
should
make
it
clear
that
i
express
no
opinion
on
the
legality
of
the
underlying
conduct
here.
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
an
illegal
tie-in
or
not.
i
do
not
think
the
record
permits
us
to
tell.
there
is
much
play
on
both
sides,
by
the
petitioner
and
by
the
respondent,
about
whether
or
not
this
program
is
good
for
consumers,
i
frankly
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
think
the
question
is
before
this
court
at
this
time
and
so
i
intend
not
to
address
that.
further
more,
i
think
the
noerr
case
which
appears
in
the
brief
frequently
is
not
involved
here.
at
least
it
is
the
government's
position
that
any
company
may
petition
the
state
for
any
rule
at
once.
we
have
no
objection
in
any
way
to
any
request
made
by
a
company
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true
and
we
have
no
objection
to
anything
that
detroit
edison
may
have
asked
the
state
to
do
or
not
to
do.
that
is
certainly
entirely
up
to
them.
the
question
here
is
simply
whether
a
federal
court
may
even
examine
respondent’s
practice
in
the
light
cast
by
the
anti-trust
laws
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
we
think
the
immunity
doctrine
was
derived
from
parker
against
brown
simply
does
not
cover
the
situation.
the
status
of
the
immunity
depends
upon
two
questions;
one
petitioner’s
counsel
has
just
discussed
in
part,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
indeed
there
is
a
state
agency
acting
with
authority
to
act,
the
ultra
virus
question
so
to
speak.
i
shall
not
discuss
that.
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
the
conduct
here
was
compelled
by
any
affirmative
policy
of
the
state.
i
think
not.
the
record
here
shows
that
so
far
as
we
can
tell
on
the
motion
for
some
summary
judgment,
the
state
of
michigan
did
not
compel
or
direct
detroit
edison
to
charge
for
light
bulbs
in
its
rates
for
electricity.
by
that
i
mean
that
this.
there
is
no
state
statute
requiring
the
practice
or
mentioning
the
practice.
there
exists
no
order
or
regulation
of
the
michigan
public
service
commission
that
mentions
the
price.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
could,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
could
abandon
it
in
one
of
two
ways.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
may
have
to
do
that,
but
i
think
they
would
have
to
go
back
with
a
new
tariff
and
they
might
have
to
go
back
with
a
new
tariff
with
the
lower
rate
because
of
the
decreased
cost.
i
am
not
even
sure
of
that
because
it
is
typical
in
regulation
that
cost
may
decrease
for
some
reason
and
the
company
does
not
immediately
go
in
and
adjust
its
rates,
as
regulatory
like
there
and
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
to
require
lower
rates,
i
think
it
would
be
and
here
i
am
told
indeed
that
at
one
time
this
company
had
home
delivery
and
the
man
actually
came
to
your
house
and
installed
the
light
bulbs
and
when
they
dropped
home
delivery
from
much
less
expensive
form
of
dispensation
of
these
bulbs,
no
mention
of
that
fact
was
made
to
the
michigan
public
service
commission.
no
tariff
change
was
instituted.
so
i
think
they
could
drop
it.
at
a
the
minimum,
they
could
certainly
go
back
and
say
we
have
dropped
it
and
we
offer
you
a
new
tariff
without
that
cost
element
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
they
wanted
to
change
a
rate,
they
might
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
stewart.
but
i
think
it
is
important
here
that
the
detroit
--
the
michigan
public
service
commission
which
regulates
across
the
state
has
never
taken
explicit
notice
of
this
practice,
has
never
even
inquired
into
it.
this
is
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
which
detroit
edison
forced
to
be
compelled
and
i
think
it
is
up
to
them
to
show
an
affirmative
policy
across
the
state
and
so
far
as
we
can
tell
from
this
record,
detroit
edison
has
not
shown
that
other
public
utilities
are
required
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
of
the
tariff?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
right
but
i
am
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
but
i
am
saying
that
insofar
if
someone
wishes
to
say
that
i
am
compelled
or
required
or
directed
by
state
law
to
do
this
as
it
was
possible
to
say
in
parker
against
brown,
one
would
look
at
least
to
some
compulsions
somewhere
in
the
law.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
take
it
that
they
were
using
something
that
closely
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
that
is
true
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
it
is
not
for
this
reason
that
i
am
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
but
that
is
my
point.
i
wish
to
make
about
that
and
that
is
that
apparently
this
commission
will
approve
tariffs
without
light
bulb
programs
included.
as
far
as
we
know
it
is
never
disapprove
a
tariff
because
of
the
light
bulb
program
was
not
included
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
follow
from
that,
that
this
practice
is
not
in
any
way
required
by
any
agency
of
the
state.
the
state's
policy
insofar
as
can
be
said
to
have
a
policy
is
entirely
permissive.
the
initiative
about
whether
or
not
there
is
a
bulb
program,
included
in
the
tariff
is
left
to
the
utilities
and
they
should
have
and
indeed
the
utility
has
the
power
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
in
parker
against
brown
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
state
had
enacted
an
elaborate
policy,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
pro-rate
program.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
had
to
be
triggered,
it
had
to
be
triggered
by
some
producers
who
wished
it.
however,
once
they
triggered
it
by
going
into
the
state
law,
that
state
law
became
compulsory
as
to
all
growers
and
so
forth
who
did
not
want
the
program.
so
they
were
compelled
by
state
law
and
criminal
vandalism
law.
and
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
so
for
this
record
shows,
the
michigan
public
service
commission
says
in
effect,
you
tell
us
which
way
you
would
rather
go,
light
bulb
program
or
no
light
bulb
program,
and
we
will
compel
you
either
way
you
wish
to.
that
is
not
a
state
affirmative
policy.
in
fact,
there
is
no
even
showing
of
compulsion.
they
are
just
included
in
the
rate.
that
is
why
this
case
reminds
when
i
think
of
schwegmann
rather
than
parker
against
brown.
at
most
here,
you
have
a
state
policy
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
policy,
i
think
it
is
inadvertence,
at
most
here,
you
have
a
state
policy
which
is,
if
you
elect
to
have
a
light
bulb
program,
alright.
that
is
what
the
state
said
about
the
fair
trade
acts
and
that
was
not
sufficient
state
action
in
schwegmann
to
stand
up
against
the
sherman
act
attack.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
a
privilege
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
in
the
brief,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
not
in
our
brief
sir,
but
it
is
341
u.s.
384.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
fact,
i
think
there
is
actually
less
state
action
here
than
there
was
in
schwegmann
because
at
least
there
the
state
had
an
explicit
affirmative
policy
of
letting
the
private
party
elect
whether
or
not
to
use
fair
trade.
here
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
we
are
nothing
more
than
state
inadvertence
or
indifference
or
oversight.
there
is
no
explicit
policy
by
letting
them
and
be
like
this.
now,
i
would
refer
to
the
goldfarb
case
421
u.s.
at
page
790
where
this
court
explains
why
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
that
case
at
least
mentioned
advised
free
schedules,
but
that
was
all
and
that
was
held
not
to
be
state
action
which
would
immunize
the
agreed
upon
fees
in
that
case.
here
there
is
no
mention
of
this
program
in
any
state
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think,
federal
preemption,
we
may
have
argued
in
some
cases
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
we
are
not
claiming
federal
preemption
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
because
i
think
we
do
feel
that
parker
against
brown
is
rightly
decided.
we
do
feel
the
sherman
act
was
not
intended
to
take
away
the
power
to
regulate
industry
from
states.
so
we
have
no
desire
argue
preemption
in
that
sense.
i
would
refer
this
court
also
to
the
opinion
in
jackson
against
metropolitan
edison
with
which
there
has
been
much
play
in
this
case
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
case
is
dispositive
in
favor
of
a
lack
of
immunity
here.
now,
i
know
that
jackson
against
metropolitan
edison
involved
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
think
if
there
was
no
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
case
there
can
be
no
state
action
for
parker
purposes
in
this
case.
and
i
would
--
i
think
at
the
minimum,
the
state
action
concept
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
as
broad
as
the
state
action
concept
for
parker
purposes
and
indeed
i
would
take
one
step
further
and
say
that
is
probably
broader
and
you
can
see
that
by
transposing
the
facts
of
the
schwegmann
case.
there
the
court
said
that
a
private
party
might
force
retailers
to
maintain
prices
and
provided
the
procedures
if
they
elected.
if
one,
in
a
parallel
fashion,
supposed
the
statute
in
which
a
state
said
a
private
party
may
force
retailers
to
keep
off
a
racial
group
from
the
premises
of
the
retailer
and
provided
procedures,
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
would
be
state
action
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
that
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
state
action
concept
is
broader
than
the
state
action
concept
here.
if
that
is
true
or
if
it
is
coterminous
than
jackson
against
metropolitan
edison,
i
think
is
dispositive
of
this
case
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
jackson?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
a
different
question,
but
as
i
ask
myself
and
how
does
the
state
action
concept
differ?
i
think
it
essentially
involves
in
affirmative
state
policy
or
involvement
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
involves
affirmative
state
policy
under
parker,
but
i
think
it
is
somewhat
perhaps
--
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
decide
which
is
broader,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
can
hardly
be
argued
plausibly
that
the
anti-trust
concept
of
state
action
is
broader
than
the
fourteenth
amendment
concept
and
unless
that
is
true
than
i
think
jackson
against
metropolitan
edison
really
disposes
of
this
case
by
analogy
if
you
wish
to
have
said
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
think
of
--
i
do
not
see
i
could
not
in
any
other
way.
i
do
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
you
go
further
than
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
say
that
parker
against
brown
requires
or
allows
not
only
affirmative
state
policy,
but
any
time
the
state
gets
into
the
area
and
involves
itself
heavily
then
you
have
done
two
things.
one
is
you
said
the
state
has
a
power
of
implied
repealer
over
the
federal
anti-trust
laws.
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct
and
the
other
thing
is
that
you
are
creating
these
elaborate
administrative
mechanisms
into
which
any
party
can
insert
his
program
in
quiet
sanctuary
even
though
the
state
was
not
thinking
about
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
you
have
50
of
them,
not
to
mention,
localities
and
this
is
becoming
a
serious
anti-trust
problem
and
i
think
applying
the
rule
as
we
ask
does
two
things.
it
forwards
federal
anti-trust
policy.
it
also
to
begins
to
put
some
pressure
on
agencies
to
focus
and
to
make
visible
decisions,
visible
to
the
electric,
to
elected
officials
about
what
it
is
they
wish
to
require
a
state
policy.
i
think
it
is
desirable
at
both
ends.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
one
thought
this
were
command,
i
think
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
stevens.
if
this
is
a
command,
however,
then
i
fear
that
almost
any
regulatory
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--
touching
of
the
subject
will
turn
out
to
be
a
command.
