justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
only
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
as
well
argue
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
again
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
public
service
commission
did
approve,
had
the
power
to
approve
and
did
approve
exactly
what
the
company
did.
now,
does
it
mean
that
it
is
exempt
for
the
anti-trust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
you
have
argued
in
your
brief
that
if
did
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
had
the
power
to
approve
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whether
they
actually
approved
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
not
order
the
company
to
do
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
statute
did
not
order
them
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
not
you
argue
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
running
out
of
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
state
law
requiring
all
companies
to
charge
the
same
prices
for
milk
be
exemption
in
anti-trust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
nevertheless
is
a
state
policy
to
have
uniform
prices
in
a
certain
industry.
now,
do
you
think
that
the
companies
following
that
state
law
are
subject
to
anti-trust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
am
positing
a
situation
where
the
state
has
ordered
the
companies
to
charge
the
same
prices.
here
you
say
the
state
has
never
ordered
edison
to
do
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
neither
court
below
decided
that
parker
against
brown
applied
here
because
there
was
an
affirmative
policy,
did
it?
did
it
not
just
say
that
the
approval
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
tariff
was
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
that
we
decided
that
was
wrong.
we
would
not
go
on
and
say
examine
this
michigan
law
and
decide
there
was
not
any
affirmative
policy,
would
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
not
a
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
or
did
the
district
court
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
saying
that
the
approval
of
the
tariff
was
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
one
want
to
know
--
and
i
take
it
neither
the
courts
below
had
said
that
the
state
law
requires
this,
so
that
there
is
an
affirmative
policy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
fortiori
it
might
not
be
the
other
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
50
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
argument
is
that
they
were
ordered
and
required
to
do
it
by
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
that
is
the
standard
that
the
parker
against
brown
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
the
rules
should
be
broader
than
that
and
cover
just
mere
authorization?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
then
now
--
so
you
agree
that
the
test
is
what
the
solicitor
general
said
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
but
you
think
he
read
parker
against
brown
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mere
authorization
would
not
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
standard
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
acted
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
true,
but
what
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
in
affirming
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
did
it
not
refer
to
authorization
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
the
district
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
not
and
i
take
it
you
do
not
think
there
is
any
problem
here
of
either
court
below
applying
the
wrong
reading
of
parker
against
brown
and
saying
that
mere
authorization
is
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
reycraft
because
what
the
district
court
said
was
when
a
state
agency
acts
affirmatively
in
approving
rates
and
practices
of
the
utility,
there
is
no
anti-trust
liability.
do
you
think
that
is
correct
statement
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
what
it
said,
that
is
not
what
the
court
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
company
required
to
file
the
tariff,
including
the
incandescent
light
bulb?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
ordered
to
file
a
tariff
as
light
bulbs
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
law
in
michigan
that
require
the
public
service
commission
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
industry,
you
can
fix
prices
in
the
industry
or
you
need
not
to
fix
prices
industry,
but
if
you
want
to,
go
ahead
just
file
a
piece
of
paper
up
here
with
our
commissioner
of
prices
and
if
he
says
okay,
go
ahead,
is
that
alright?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
even
if
the
law
said
that
if
you
want
to
fix
prices
in
the
industry,
just
file
a
piece
of
paper
and
if
you
file
a
piece
of
paper
then
you
will
be
ordered
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
are
under
an
order,
once
you
have
all
agreed
to
this
under
an
order
then
you
are
ordered
to
do
it,
although
you
do
not
have
to
decide
in
the
first
place,
the
law
does
not
require
you
to
fix
prices.
here
is
an
option
that
to
fix
prices
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
you
are
dealing
with
an
instance
where
the
authority
or
the
agency
extended
to
deciding
the
kind
of
an
issue
that
was
up
in
the
anti-trust
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here
the
state
proceeding
is
a
rate
making
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
you
said
the
hearing
certainly
did
not
proceed
as
though
it
was
a
--
had
any
anti-competitive
including
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
both
courts
below
accepted
the
order
as
valid,
they
did
not,
within
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
reycraft,
how
many
utilities
are
there
in
michigan,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
good
many
others
that
they
do
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
in
michigan
are
there
good
many
others
who
do
not
have
the
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
free
not
to
have
it
under
michigan
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
are
the
ones
who
decided
what
kind
of
a
tariff
to
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
do
you
know
of
any
instance
where
the
commission
has
ordered
a
utility
to
have
a
lamp
program
against
its
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
statute
does
not
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
arguing
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
question
i
asked
mr.
reycraft,
if
the
state
said
--
had
a
general
statute
that
said
if
industries
would
like
to
substitute
price
fixing
for
competition,
they
may
and
anybody
wants
to
fix
prices
comes
in
and
applies
to
price
commissioner
and
gets
permission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
decisions
have
whether
or
not
to
furnish
light
bulbs
is
their
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
do
not
get
--
they
have
never
ordered
anybody
to
furnish
light
bulbs?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
did
not
ask
you
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
whose
decision
was
it
in
the
first
place
to
put
in
the
tariff?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
started
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
and
then
could
they
take
it
out
if
they
wanted
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
detroit
edison.
justice
byron
r.
white
many
other
utilities
do
not
furnish
light
bulbs?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
a
state
policy
is
that
with
respect
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
the
factor
does
not
have
to
be
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
the
same
thing
i
suppose
if
all
the
michigan
utilities
are
on
the
side
agree
upon
themselves
to
furnish
light
bulbs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well.
they
did
not
submit
the
commission
the
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
your
answer?
