mr.
james
l.
babin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
of
robert
versus
louisiana
pertains
to
a
young
black
man
who
killed
a
61-year-old
white
man,
while
engaged
in
the
armed
robbery
of
a
filling
station
on
august
18,
1973.
the
statute
which
existed
in
louisiana
prior
to
the
furman
decision
was
the
murder
statute
which
provided
that
if
you
had
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
inflict
great
bodily
harm
on
anyone
and
he
died
as
result
of
that
then
you
could
receive
the
death
penalty
or
would
receive
the
death
penalty,
if
you
were
found
guilty
as
charged.
however,
in
the
list
of
responsive
verdicts
to
the
prior
murder
charge
in
louisiana
prior
to
furman,
one
of
the
responsive
verdicts
was
that
the
jury
could
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
capital
punishment,
if
the
jury
saw
fit
to
give
mercy
to
the
person
who
was
being
tried
and
who
was
found
guilty
then
they
could
return
a
responsive
verdict
of
guilty
without
capital
punishment.
however,
after
the
furman
decision
was
the
decided
by
this
honorable
court,
the
governor
of
the
state
louisiana
appointed
the
commission
and
they
met
and
they
enacted
certain
laws
in
special
session
in
louisiana
which
takes
a
two-thirds
vote
to
open
such
special
session
to
legislation
such
is
this
which
would
could
be
considered
normal
legislation.
the
commission
discussed
the
furman
decision
and
the
statutes
of
louisiana
as
they
were
at
that
time
and
we
came
up
with
the
first-degree
murder
statute
and
a
second-degree
murder
statute.
the
first-degree
murder
statute
which
louisiana
now
has
encompasses
those
types
of
killings
where
the
defendant
himself
initiated
the
action.
in
another
words,
he
started
or
put
into
motion
whatever
later
caused
the
death.
in
other
words,
he
took
a
gun
and
he
went
into
as
service
station
and
he
held
that
service
station
up
and
as
result
of
his
being
there
with
this
dangerous
weapon
and
as
a
result
of
his
specific
intent
to
kill,
someone
died.
these
types
of
crimes
where
placed
into
the
first-degree
murder
statute.
you
take
the
crimes
of
murder
where
you
have
the
family
argument,
you
have
the
bar
room
brawl
where
there
is
specific
intent
to
kill,
but
it
is
not
initiated
by
you
committing
a
felony
or
you
killing
a
policeman
while
he
in
the
engagement
of
his
duties
or
while
you
are
in
the
prison
or
while
you
are
committing
aggravated
rapes
or
other
more
serious
felonies.
first-degree
murder
encompasses
those
particular
items.
second-degree
murder
takes
care
of
those
items
or
those
murders
which
were
not
initiated
by
the
defendant
himself
while
he
in
the
perpetration
of
those
particular
instances.
the
first-degree
murder
statute
in
louisiana
carries
with
it
the
mandatory
death
penalty.
mr.
james
l.
babin
no
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
if
he
had
the
intention
to
kill
more
than
two.
mr.
james
l.
babin
he
walked
into
the
bar
and
he
had
gun
and
he
decided
to
shoot
all
five
men
standing
at
the
bar,
then
it
would
come
under
the
first-degree
murder
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
but
he
would
have
up
to
show
specific
intent
or
the
state
would
that
he
intended
to
kill
more
than
in
one
person.
mr.
james
l.
babin
the
first-degree
murder
statute
as
i
have
said
carries
with
it
the
mandatory
death
penalty.
the
jury
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
the
first-degree
murder
case
has
to
find
every
element
of
that
crime
before
they
can
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.
they
must
find
specific
intent
to
kill.
they
must
find
if
it
is
an
armed
robbery
case
that
all
of
the
elements
of
armed
robbery
are
present.
they
must
find
of
course
jurisdiction
and
they
must
find
the
other
elements
of
a
crime.
they
are
sworn
members
of
that
court.
they
are
sworn
to
find
a
person
guilty
if
he
is
proven
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
if
the
state
has
proven
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
each
and
every
one
of
those
elements.
now,
if
the
state
fails
to
prove
each
and
every
one
of
those
elements
then
he
of
course
is
instructed
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
or
he
is
given
a
list
of
responsive
verdicts
which
he
can
return.
now,
this
was
discussed
at
the
commission
when
the
new
laws
were
enacted.
it
was
at
first
thought
that
it
would
be
best
just
to
have
guilty
or
not
guilty,
but
suppose
that
the
state
proven
a
man
--
was
unable
to
prove
a
man
guilty
of
first-degree
murder,
but
he
is
able
or
does
prove
him
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
guilty
of
second-degree
murder,
should
he
go
free?
the
state
has
proven
that
he
committed
a
crime.
they
have
not
proven
that
he
committed
a
crime
of
first-degree
murder,
but
they
have
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
all
of
the
elements
of
another
crime.
therefore,
the
jury
can
bring
in
a
responsive
verdict
of
the
particular
crime
that
has
proven
to
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
when
the
judge
instructs
that
jury
and
he
must
instruct
them
each
time,
if
you
find
that
the
state
has
proven
beyond
a
reasonable,
all
the
elements
of
first-degree
murder,
it
is
your
duty
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.
then
the
court
instructs
as
they
did
in
this
case,
if
you
do
not
find
that
the
state
has
proven
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
first-degree
murder,
but
that
you
do
find
that
the
state
has
proven
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
second-degree
murder
then
it
is
your
duty
return
a
verdict
of
second-degree
and
own
down
to
responsive
list
of
verdicts
until
it
comes,
if
the
state
has
not
proven
any
elements
of
any
these
crimes
then
you
shall
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
then
if
this
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
charged,
the
first-degree
murder,
it
has
no
discretion
whatsoever.
the
judge
has
no
discretion
whatsoever
is
then
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
there
is
no
discretion
by
a
person
as
to
whether
a
particular
person
will
die
or
not
die.
if
he
is
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
then
he
is
sentenced
to
death.
the
court
has
no
ability
nor
discretion
either.
it
has
to
and
as
the
statute
provides,
it
must
give
the
death
penalty
in
those
cases
where
the
defendant
is
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder.
mr.
james
l.
babin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
babin
he
does
not
and
must
not,
yes
sir.
however,
of
course
a
jury
as
a
matter
practicalities
is
questioned
on
the
death
penalty
when
he
is
questioned
as
a
juror
and
he
not
naturally
will
know
if
he
is
going
to
be
accepted
by
juror
that
it
is
going
to
pertain
to
the
death
penalty,
that
is
matter
of
practicalities.
however,
the
judge,
the
jury
in
louisiana
has
no
right
to
sentence
in
no
case
whether
it
is
the
death
penalty
or
death
of
whatever
it
maybe
that
it
is
the
judge's
prerogative
and
it
is
not
left
to
the
jury.
the
part
or
the
part
of
the
argument
that
has
been
made
--
mr.
james
l.
babin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
babin
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
mr.
amsterdam
that
there
are
certain
prerogatives
to
the
district
attorney
that
he
can
(inaudible)
that
he
has
control
of
the
case
that
he
can
charge
as
he
sees
fit.
in
louisiana,
you
cannot
charge
a
capital
case
without
bringing
it
a
grand
jury,
presenting
your
evidence
and
having
that
accused
rebut
it,
bring
the
charge
so
the
da
certainly
does
not
have
the
right
to
bring
a
capital
case
or
charge
one
as
he
sees
fit.
he
has
to
do
it
though
a
grand
jury.
the
da
does
have
a
right
to
(inaudible)
even
to
a
grand
jury
indictment,
but
this
is
something
that
the
district
attorney
stands
as
a
barrier
between
the
law
enforcement
and
the
defendant
himself.
this
is
something
that
is
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant.
the
other
thing
that
is
brought
out
by
the
defendant
--
mr.
james
l.
babin
alright
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
briefly
just
restate
our
position,
right
before
we
finished
yesterday
afternoon,
after
the
furman
decision
the
louisiana
legislature
at
a
special
session,
which
requires
two
thirds
vote
to
bring
up
the
normal
type
of
legislation,
which
this
was,
brought
the
louisiana
murder
statute
from
the
plain
murder
which
would
have
previous
to
that
time,
first
degree
and
second-degree
murder,
placing
in
the
first
degree
murder
statute,
those
crimes
which
are
somewhat
initiated
by
the
defendant
himself.
in
other
words,
those
that
happen
with
specific
intent,
when
he
is
in
the
perpetration
of
aggravated
rape,
aggravated
burglary,
armed
robbery,
such
as
that
or
people
who
are
hired
to
kill,
people
who
kill
policemen
while
they
are
engaged
in
their
duties
and
the
more
serious
crimes
and
the
crimes
that
defendants
actually
initiate
and
start
themselves.
as
i
stated
before,
the
second-degree
murder
statute,
while
it
does
carry
with
it
some
instances,
specifically
takes
care
of
those
killings
where
you
may
have
a
man
who
is
in
a
bar,
he
is
drunk,
he
is
in
a
fight,
he
does
have
the
intent
to
kill
and
he
may
kill
someone,
but
it
is
not
the
type
that
you
will
find
in
the
first
degree
murder
statute,
which
this
case
involves.
in
louisiana,
the
legislature
also
amended
the
responsive
verdict
statutes
and
the
responsive
verdict
to
first
degree
murder
no
longer
contains
the
guilty
without
captive
punishment
responsive
verdict.
it
is
either
guilty
or
guilty
of
the
other
crimes,
such
as
second-degree
murder
or
man
slaughter.
now,
when
the
judge
gives
the
jury,
who
are
sworn
members
of
that
court,
the
instructions
as
to
what
they
are
to
do,
he
will
instruct
them
that
you
must
find
every
element
which
is
in
first
degree
murder.
in
other
words,
you
must
find
specific
intent
to
kill.
you
must
find
every
element
in
this
case
of
armed
robbery.
then
and
if
you
do
find
such
elements
and
it
is
proven
to
you
by
the
prosecutor
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
you
are
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.
if
the
verdict
of
guilty
is
returned
in
such
a
case,
no
longer
does
the
jury
nor
the
judge
have
any
control
of
what
the
sentence
will
be.
it
is
a
mandatory
death
sentence
at
that
stage.
the
juries
in
the
louisiana
and
in
the
united
states,
if
the
argument
of
the
respondent
were
to
be
believed
or
not
dependable,
that
they
will
not
attempt
to
follow
their
duties
that
they
are
sworn
to
do,
that
they
have
taken
an
oath
to
do.
this
goes
further
even
if
you
were
to
follow
his
argument
than
the
murder
statute.
it
does
not
necessarily
involve
the
death
penalty.
if
the
jurors
are
suspect,
if
the
jury
is
not
going
to
follow
his
instructions,
he
has
said
that
he
would
follow
the
law
of
the
state
and
he
has
taken
an
oath
to
do
so.
there
is
nothing
further
you
can
do
to
make
him
do
that
and
if
jurors
are
suspect,
then
the
jury
system
can
no
longer
exist
and
i
certainly
think
--
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
in
the
furman
decision
intended
such
a
thing
or
a
change
in
the
system,
such
as
that.
the
juries
that
i
have
had
any
experience
with
or
the
juries
that
i
have
tried
cases
before
or
i
have
seen
cases
tried
before,
appear
to
me
to
be
the
average
person
and
the
person
who
feels
a
seriousness,
especially
in
a
murder
case
of
the
job
that
he
has
before
him
and
one
that
he
would
give
his
best
ability
that
he
is
able
to
give
to
that
particular
job
and
to
the
facts
that
are
presented
to
him.
the
system
that
is
set
in
louisiana,
takes
away
from
the
judge
or
the
jury
any
arbitrariness
in
the
verdict
or
the
sentence
that
it
will
give.
the
jury
is
instructed
by
that
judge
that
whatever
is
proven
to
him,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
if
it
is
a
crime
of
first
degree
murder
as
in
this
case
and
the
elements
are
proven
to
them,
then
it
is
their
sworn
duty
to
return
a
verdict
of
guilty.
therefore,
we
do
not
have
--
we
have
guidelines
first
of
all
for
a
jury
to
reach
a
verdict.
then,
once
it
has
reached
its
verdict,
that
it
no
longer
has
any
control
over
that
case
or
that
defendant.
the
respondent
as
i
understood
also
says
that
since
the
district
attorney
of
the
various
districts
or
the
prosecutors
have
control
over
the
cases,
then
you
have
another
human
element
involved.
it
is
true
that
district
attorneys
and
prosecutors
in
louisiana
and
in
all
other
states,
i
believe,
have
the
right
to
try
cases
(inaudible)
as
they
see
right,
see
fit
or
to
charge.
but
in
a
death
penalty
case
in
louisiana,
the
district
attorney
cannot
charge
by
bill
of
information.
he
can
only
charge
by
bill
of
indictment
returned
by
a
jury
of
12
grand
jurors.
therefore,
he
has
to
way
to
be
arbitrary
in
the
initiation
of
a
death
penalty
charge.
it
must
be
brought
by
jury
of
12.
once
the
charge
of
first
degree
murder
has
been
brought,
as
it
was
in
this
case
by
jury
of
12
in
calcasieu
parish
and
once
the
defendant
is
tried
and
if
he
is
found
guilty,
that
district
attorney
loses
control
of
the
defendant,
the
sentencing
and
the
charge
itself,
he
no
longer
has
any
control,
whatsoever.
so,
the
only
control
that
a
district
attorney
or
prosecutor
has
is
prior
to
the
finding
of
the
final
guilt
of
an
individual,
but
once
in
louisiana
this
man
is
found
of
any
crime,
no
matter
what
it
maybe,
but
particularly
in
a
death
case,
he
has
no
control
whatsoever.
it
is
true
in
louisiana
that
the
governor
has
the
right
to
commutate
sentences.
mr.
james
l.
babin
direct
to
the
us
supreme
court,
mr.
justice.
mr.
james
l.
babin
to
the
louisiana’s
supreme
court.
mr.
james
l.
babin
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
first
you
will
have
your
bills
of
exception
--
mr.
james
l.
babin
no
sir,
not
for
criminal
cases.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes
sir,
and
it
has
a
right
or
does
review
those
particular
bills
of
errors
that
the
defense
attorney
has
brought
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
plus
it
has
the
right
to
review
anything
that
is
in
the
face
of
record
of
it
is
own
right,
that
is
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
james
l.
babin
no
sir.
it
does
not.
it
can
remand,
reverse,
but
it
cannot
reduce
a
sentence.
mr.
james
l.
babin
no
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
right.
mr.
james
l.
babin
it
does
not
have
a
right
to
find
the
evidence
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes,
sir.
it
does
not.
mr.
james
l.
babin
it
does
not
have
the
power
just
to
reduce
to
review
again
that
jury's
verdict
at
the
final
outset.
mr.
james
l.
babin
unless
there
is
an
error
of
patent
on
the
face
of
the
record
or
there
was
an
error
which
was
brought
by
the
defense
attorney
and
a
bill
of
exception
were
brought
by
him.
mr.
james
l.
babin
no
sir.
that
is
within
the
jury’s
prerogative.
mr.
james
l.
babin
no
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
they
just
do
not
have
that
authority,
your
honor,
that
is
the
jury’s
prerogative
only.
mr.
james
l.
babin
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
unless
your
honor,
mr.
justice
said
there
was
an
error
patent
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
it
could
tell,
but
not
just
to
say
that
it
reviewed
the
evidence
and
it
does
not
agree
with
the
jury.
mr.
james
l.
babin
well,
by
that
time
your
honor,
there
would
have
been
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
with
the
trial
judge
and
if
there
was
new
evidence
or
if
new
evidence
was
produced
before
the
trial
judge,
he
has
a
right
to
grant
a
new
trial.
mr.
james
l.
babin
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
babin
this
is
the
jury’s
decision,
based
on
the
evidence
alone,
as
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
babin
(inaudible)
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
they
do
not
review
that.
if
they
have
some
error
that
has
been
made
by
the
court
or
the
attorneys
or
any
error
on
the
patent
of
the
face
of
the
record,
they
review
that
of
their
own,
on
their
own
right.
mr.
james
l.
babin
your
honor,
it
has
a
right
to
review
motion
for
a
new
trial,
which
would
have
been
filed
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
l.
babin
well,
you
can
ask
for
a
mistrial
after
the
state
has
put
on
its
evidence,
then
if
that
is
not
granted,
then
at
the
end
of
that
you
are
allowed
to
put
on
evidence
or
to
say
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
here
and
ask
for
a
new
trial
--
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes,
sir
and
--
mr.
james
l.
babin
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
right.
mr.
james
l.
babin
that
is
what
i
was
saying
earlier
sir.
once
that
motion
has
been
made,
the
supreme
court
can
review
that
motion
that
was
made
for
a
new
trial,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
there
should
have
been
a
new
trial,
then
they
would
grant
it.
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes
sir.
i
thought
you
may
have,
but
they
could
take
it
up
on
their
own
right,
just
to
look
at
the
evidence
or
thought
that
was
the
first
question
and
say,
“well,
there
is
not
enough
evidence
here.”
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes
sir.
the
governor
of
the
state
of
louisiana
does
have
the
right
of
commutation
after
there
has
been
a
review
by
the
board
of
pardons.
however,
this
is
only
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant.
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
no
way,
where
it
cannot
be
to
the
determinant
of
the
defendant
himself.
therefore,
we
do
not
see
how
it
could
be
used
in
anyway
to
do
away
with
this
statute,
which
the
state
of
louisiana
has
for
first
degree
murder,
second-degree
murder
or
homicides,
which
occur.
mr.
james
l.
babin
yes
sir.
mr.
james
l.
babin
first,
the
trial
jury
instructs
the
jury
as
to
the
elements
of
the
crime,
which
a
defendant
is
charged
with
and
informs
them
that
hey
must
find
that
each
element
has
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
then,
he
informs
them
of
the
law
of
other
responsive
verdicts.
mr.
james
l.
babin
if
he
says
--
mr.
james
l.
babin
he
says
that
if
you
do
not
find
that
the
state
has
proven
this
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
all
the
elements
of
first
degree
murder
then
you
are
to
return
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
but
if
you
find
that
they
have
not
proven
all
of
the
elements
of
first
degree
murder,
but
they
have
proven
all
of
the
elements
of
second
degree
murder
which
is
already
given
them
the
definition
of,
he
gives
them
the
definition
also,
then
you
ought
to
find
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
and
down
the
line,
giving
the
definition
of
the
crime
and
also
the
elements
that
they
ought
to
find.
the
state
of
louisiana
is
not
here
arguing
in
a
general
sense
as
the
respondent
understands
today
and
is,
we
have
a
case
which
was
involved
here,
where
a
man
killed
another
man
when
he
was
engaged
in
the
perpetration
of
an
armed
robbery.
the
fact
he
killed
him
when
it
does
not
appear
to
the
state
that
he
even
need
not
to
kill
him.
this
is
a
killing,
which
has
been
presented
to
our
grand
jury
and
laid
it
to
our
jury.
your
honor,
we
asked
that
or
your
honors
we
ask
that
the
honorable
supreme
court
affirm
this
decision.
