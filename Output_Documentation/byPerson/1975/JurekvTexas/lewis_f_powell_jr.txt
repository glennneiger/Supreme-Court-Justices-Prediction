justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
have
now
an
opportunity
to
address
in
your
oral
argument
the
issue
of
the
deterrence.
i
recognize
of
course
that
the
statistical
data
can
be
construed
in
various
ways
and
i
would
agree
to
this,
perhaps
not
controlling
or
conclusive,
yet,
i
would
invite
your
attention
to
some
figures
and
then
ask
you
a
question.
i
have
the
before
me
the
1973
report
of
a
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
it
states
that
in
1968,
15,720
people
were
murdered
in
this
country.
in
1973,
the
latest
year
reported
in
this
report,
19,510
people
were
murdered
that
is
an
increase
of
42%.
in
gross
numbers
that
is
an
increase
of
5,790
people.
i
do
not
have
the
more
recent
figures.
i
think
i
have
read
in
a
press
that
they
show
some
slight
downward
trend.
it
is
perfectly
obvious
from
these
figures
that
we
need
some
way
to
deter
the
slaughter
of
americans.
i
use
the
word
slaughter,
because
that
word
was
used
in
connection
with
the
disaster
in
vietnam
in
which
55,000
americans
were
killed,
over
a
6
to
7-year
period.
if
the
fbi
figures
are
correct,
there
were
more
americans
killed
in
this
country,
more
than
there
were
in
the
battle
fields
of
vietnam.
would
you
care
comment
or
elaborate
your
views
with
respect
to,
did
they
at
all
affected
any
of
the
death
sentence?
