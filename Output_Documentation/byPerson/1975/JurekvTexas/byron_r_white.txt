i
take
that
you
are
going
to
tell
us
why
you
think
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
federal
constitutional
rule,
of
course
is
that
there
is
not
any
evidence
at
all,
that
the
conviction
is
going
to
stand.
now,
i
suppose
the
--
do
you
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
is
foreclosed
by
your
own
rules
from
following
that
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
can
be
made
on
the
grounds
of
insufficient
evidence,
can
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
verdict,
after
verdict
you
can
make
a
motion
for
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
make
it
on
the
ground
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
if
--
and
if
the
motion
denied,
the
denial
of
that
motion
can
be
reviewed
in
the
supreme
court
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
may
review
the
trial
courtâ€™s
judgment
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence?

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
hearings
have
been
held
--
how
many
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
capital
convictions
have
there
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
instances
have
somebody
have
been
found
guilty
of
a
crime
for
which
death
could
be
imposed,
in
the
second
hearing
or
put
it
the
other
way,
in
how
many
instances
has
the
second
phase
turned
out
that
death
sentence
was
not
imposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
must
be
some
where
--
are
there
any,
where
they
did
not
impose
death
and
were
not
hanged?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
if
--
i
take
it
in
the
second
phase,
the
jury
can
come
back
and
say
the
special
circumstances
are
not
present?
justice
byron
r.
white
cannot
they
--
oh,
i
know,
but
they
may
do
that,
cannot
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
many
times
has
that
happened?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
do
accept
that
principle
under
the
eighth
amendment
that
punishments
that
are
disproportionate
or
sufficiently
disproportionate
are
impermissible
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
little
different
than
just
dis-proportionality?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
means
that
perhaps,
but
it
does
not
only
mean
that.
i
mean,
in
other
words,
you
would
concede
i
suppose
that
if
a
state
imposed
or
inflicted
capital
punishment
for
jay
walking,
it
would
be
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
even
though
if
you
submitting
to
us,
capital
punishment
per
se
is
not
cruel
and
unusual.
but,
it
means
and
that
is
your
point
now,
but
also
what
if
a
state
said
for
the
most
heinous
kind
of
first
degree
murders,
we
are
going
to
inflict
the
breaking
a
man
on
the
wheel
and
then
disemboweling
him,
while
he
is
still
alive
and
then
burning
him
up.
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
also
accept
the
judging
the
cruelty
in
the
light
of
contemporary
morality?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
same
to
the
question
of
proportionality
or
does
--
or
do
courts
have
some
independent
input
into
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
if
enough
legislatures
passed
the
law,
you
would
say
the
courts
have
no
basis
to
say
that
the
penalty
is
disproportionate?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
need
to
defend
it
affirmatively
and
nor
the
states
need
to
defend
it
affirmatively
on
that
concept,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
we
should
over
turn
furman
then,
on
your
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
then
you
think
it
is
required
by
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
consistent
with
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
prior
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
dis-proportionality?
you
say
that
is
one
of
the
principles
under
the
eighth
amendment?
could
you
spell
out
what
is
your
understanding
is
of
that
rule?
disproportionate
to
what
and
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
apparently,
the
state
together
with
the
government
would
get
out
of
the
imposing
that
offense,
if
it
gets
out
of
it,
whatever,
you
got
out
of
the
imposing
punishment
and
you
think
disproportionate
--
you
just
do
not
get
out
of
it
--
the
injury
inflicted
is
just
disproportionate
to
what
we
termed
the
state
can
be
expected
to
get?
i
mean,
deterring
false
entries
just
is
not
worth
imposing
that
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
have
been
the
evidence
they
looked
to,
to
determine
whether
what
they
get
out
of
it
is
worth
it,
but
that
nevertheless
determining
whether
it
was
worth
was
part
of
it,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
it
was
cruel,
i
do
not
know
about
the
disproportionate?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure,
but
it
might
have
been
unusual,
(voice

not
in
--
what
about
murder?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
judgment
to
announce
in
jurek
against
texas,
75-5394.
again
i
speak
primarily
for
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
powell
for
the
three
of
us
have
again
filed
a
joint
opinion.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
of
death
for
the
crime
of
murder
under
the
law
of
texas
violates
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
the
petitioner
was
charged
by
indictment
with
the
killing
of
10-year
girl,
by
choking
and
strangling
her
with
his
hands,
and
by
drowning
her
in
water,
by
throwing
her
into
a
river
in
the
course
of
committing
and
attempting
to
commit
kidnapping
or
forcible
rape.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
texas
law
requires
that
if
a
defendant
has
been
convicted
of
a
capital
offense,
the
trial
court
must
conduct
a
separate
sentencing
proceeding
before
the
same
jury
that
tried
the
issue
of
guilt.
any
relevant
evidence
may
be
introduced
at
this
proceeding,
and
both
prosecution
and
the
defense
may
present
argument
for
or
against
the
sentence
of
death.
the
jury
is
then
presented
with
two
or
sometimes
three
statutory
questions,
the
answers
to
which
determine
whether
a
death
sentence
will
be
imposed.
in
this
case,
the
jury
unanimously
answered
"yes"
to
both
questions,
and
the
judge,
therefore,
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
death.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
affirmed.
after
this
court's
decision
in
furman
against
georgia,
the
texas
legislature
narrowed
the
scope
of
its
laws
relating
to
capital
punishment
and
adopted
a
new
capital
sentencing
procedure.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
thus
far
affirmed
only
two
judgments
imposing
death
sentences
under
its
new
statute.
while
texas
has
not
adopted
a
list
of
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
the
existence
of
which
can
justify
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
as
have
georgia
and
florida,
texas
has
narrowed
the
categories
of
murders
for
which
a
death
sentence
may
ever
be
imposed.
each
of
the
five
classes
of
murders
made
capital
by
the
texas
statute
is
encompassed
in
georgia
and
florida
by
one
or
more
of
their
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
thus,
in
essence,
the
texas
statute
requires
that
the
jury
find
the
existence
of
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
before
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed.
it
therefore
requires
the
sentencing
authority
to
focus
on
the
particularized
nature
of
the
crime.
but
a
sentencing
system
that
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
only
aggravating
circumstances
would
almost
certainly
fall
short
of
providing
the
individualized
sentencing
determination
that
we
believe
that
constitution
requires.
a
jury
must
be
allowed
to
consider
on
the
basis
of
all
relevant
evidence,
not
only
why
a
death
sentence
should
be
imposed,
but
also
why
it
should
not
be
imposed.
thus
a
capital-sentencing
system
must
allow
the
sentencing
authority
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances.
the
texas
statute,
unlike
the
georgia
and
florida,
does
not
explicitly
speak
of
mitigating
circumstances.
it
directs
only
that
the
jury
answer
certain
specific
questions.
thus
in
our
opinion
the
constitutionality
of
the
texas
procedures
turns
on
whether
those
questions
allow
consideration
of
particularized
mitigating
factors.
in
this
case,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
interpreted
the
second
statutory
question
so
as
to
incorporate
into
it
whatever
mitigating
circumstances
the
defense
maybe
able
to
bring
to
the
jury's
attention.
and
in
the
only
other
case
in
which
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
upheld
a
death
sentence,
it
also
focused
on
the
question,
whether
any
mitigating
factors
were
present.
as
construed
therefore,
the
texas
statue
does
provide
for
consideration
of
mitigating
as
well
as
aggravating
circumstance.
by
narrowing
its
definition
of
capital
murder,
texas
has
essentially
said
that
there
must
be
at
least
one
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
in
a
first-degree
murder
case
before
a
death
sentence
may
even
be
considered.
by
authorizing
the
defense
to
bring
before
the
jury
at
the
separate
sentencing
hearing,
whatever
mitigating
circumstances
relating
to
the
individual
defendant
can
be
adduced,
texas
has
ensured
that
the
sentencing
jury
will
have
adequate
guidance
to
enable
it
to
perform
its
sentencing
function.
by
providing
prompt
judicial
review
of
the
jury's
decision
in
a
court
with
statewide
jurisdiction,
texas
has
provided
a
means
to
promote
the
evenhanded,
rational,
and
consistent
imposition
of
death
sentences
under
law.
accordingly,
for
reasons
more
fully
stated
in
the
opinion
which
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
powell
and
i
have
filed
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
this
case
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
again
concur
in
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
i
have
filed
and
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
as
in
the
prior
case
it's
already
announced,
we
cannot
conclude
that
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments
prohibit
the
death
penalty
under
any
and
all
circumstances.
that
argument
is
also
made
in
this
case.
we
also
cannot
agree
with
petitioner's
other
major
contention
that
under
the
new
texas
statute
and
the
state's
criminal
justice
system
in
general,
the
criminal
jury
and
other
law
enforcement
officers
exercise
such
a
range
of
discretion
that
the
death
penalty
will
be
imposed
so
seldom
and
arbitrarily
that
the
that
the
new
statute
suffers
from
the
infirmities
which
branch
against
texas
found
in
its
predecessor.
under
the
revised
law,
the
substantive
crime
of
murder
is
defined
and
when
a
murder
occurs
in
one
of
the
five
circumstances
set
out
in
the
statute,
that
death
penalty
must
be
imposed
if
the
jury
also
makes
certain
additional
findings
against
the
defendant.
petitioner
claims
that
the
additional
questions
upon
which
the
death
sentence
turns
are
so
vague
that
in
essence
the
jury
possesses
standardless
sentencing
power,
but
we
agree
with
plurality
that
the
issues
posed
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
have
a
common-sense
core
of
meaning
and
that
criminal
juries
should
be
capable
of
understanding
them.
the
statute
does
not
extend
to
juries
unbridled
discretionary
power
to
dispense
mercy,
and
it
should
not
be
assumed
that
juries
will
disobey
or
nullify
their
instructions.
we
cannot
conclude
at
this
juncture
that
the
death
penalty
under
this
system
will
fail
to
serve
any
useful
penological
function
and
hence
falls
within
reach
of
the
decision
announced
by
five
members
of
this
court
in
furman
v.
georgia
and
branch
v.
texas.
we
accordingly
concur
in
the
judgment
of
affirmance.
mr.
justice
blackmun
also
concurs
in
the
judgment
for
reasons
stated
in
dissent
in
the
furman
case.
