mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
know
the
court
has
already
been
informed,
during
the
first
hour
i
shall
be
presenting
the
argument
for
the
petitioners
in
both,
jurek
v.
texas
and
roberts
v.
louisiana
and
the
respondents
in
both
of
this
two
cases
will
then
reply
seriatim
during
the
next
hour.
since
these
are
the
first
of
five
cases
in
which
the
court
will
be
considering
the
constitutionally
under
the
eighth
amendment
of
varying
in
forms
of
capital
punishment.
it
may
be
useful
of
the
outset
to
give
the
court
a
brief
description
of
the
present
state
of
capital
statutes
in
the
country,
statutes
now
in
effect
and
of
the
representative
character
of
five
that
are
in
now
before
the
court.
decision
of
these
cases
may
go
in
broader
and
narrower
grounds
and
i
think
it
is
useful
for
the
court
to
know
how
these
cases
fit
against
the
total
picture
of
capital
legislation
in
the
country.
since
the
court's
1972
decision
in
furman,
capital
punishment
statutes
have
been
enacted
in
35
states
of
which
34
are
now
in
affect
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
struck
down
the
constitutionally
of
that
state
death
penalty
statute
on
the
variety
of
state
and
federal
grounds.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
was
pre-furman
statute
and
i
will
come
to
those
in
just
one
moment,
if
i
may.
i
am
talking
only
about
statutes
enacted
since
furman.
the
federal
government
of
course
has
also
punished
with
death,
certain
killings
in
course
air
piracy.
now,
these
various
statutes
range
in
breadth
in
terms
of
the
crime
which
is
made
capital,
from
the
federal
statute
on
the
one
hand
which
is
narrow
one
and
the
statute
in
rhode
island
which
punishes
murder
by
a
prison
inmate,
to
broad
statutes
which
make
all
first
degree
murders
punishable
by
death
and
sometimes
other
crimes
as
well.
the
pre-furman
statutes
which
this
court
mentioned
in
furman
and
whose
constitutionally
were
reserved
or
i
should
say
largely
out
of
the
picture
now
because
they
had
either
been
superseded
by
new
legislation
as
in
ohio,
rhode
island,
virginia,
or
in
massachusetts
where
they
were
not,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
has
invalidated
as
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
the
pre-furman
rape-murder
statute
in
that
jurisdiction.
so,
we
are
basically
talking
to
that,
about
the
34
post-furman
statutes
or
35.
now,
these
assume
a
variety
of
forms,
but
i
think
they
can
fairly
be
characterize
into
four
major
categories.
first
of
all
there
are
the
statutes
which
involve
a
bi-fabricated
trial,
a
two-stage
trial
proceeding,
during
the
first
of
which,
the
jury
determines
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
a
crime
to
find
this
cap
and
during
the
second
stage
of
which
the
jury
considers
or
the
judge
considers
and
this
may
differ
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction,
there
has
been
advisory
jury,
a
list
of
aggravating
circumstances
and
a
list
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
or
there
may
just
be
aggravating
circumstances
as
in
judge
with
no
listed
mitigating
circumstances,
but
the
unique
characteristic
of
this
group
of
states
is
a
weighing
process
in
which
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
supposed
to
be
balanced
in
some
way
to
determine
their
sufficiency
for
the
purpose
of
the
imposing
the
penalty
of
death.
now,
there
are
eight
states
which
has
have
that
kind
of
statute
of
which
statutes
of
florida
and
georgia,
now
before
the
court
are
quite
represented.
the
second
of
the
four
categories
are
statutes
which
require
a
finding
of
some
specified
fact,
where
circumstance
or
condition,
in
addition
to
the
elements
of
the
crime
described
as
a
capital
crime,
which
has
to
be
found,
which
must
be
found
in
order
to
support
the
imposition
of
the
capital
punishment.
now,
these
statutes
sometimes
have
a
two-stage
proceeding
bifurcated
trial.
sometimes
they
have
a
one-stag
proceeding.
sometimes
as
in
wyoming
they
have
both,
that
is
depending
on
the
crime,
but
the
important
characteristic
here
is
that
there
is
no
weighing
or
balancing
process.
inquiry
is
made
whether
a
particular
circumstance
and
aggravating
feature
exists.
if
it
does
then
the
death
penalty
is
be
imposed.
sometimes
there
is
a
provision
that
if
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
found,
but
a
mitigating
circumstance
is
also
found,
that
the
death
penalty
shall
not
be
imposed.
this
is
the
federal
statute
for
example,
the
air
piracy
statute
and
texas
is
very
good
example
of
this
kind
of
thing.
in
texas,
as
we
will
see
shortly
when
we
get
to
the
texas
statue,
it
is
not
enough
to
convict
the
defendant
of
capital
murder
in
order
to
sentence
him
to
death.
in
addition
to
that,
three
special
verdict
questions
are
submitted
to
the
jury
and
life
or
death
depends
on
the
answers
to
those
three
questions.
now,
the
texas
statute
is
the
representative
statute
and
that
group
is
before
the
court
now.
it
looks
a
little
different
on
its
face
than
many
of
the
other
statute
in
this
category
because
it
has
this
rather
unique
feature
about
the
determining
whether
there
a
probability
that
the
defendant
would
engage
in
a
continuing
course
of
criminal
violence
and
would
be
a
danger
to
the
society,
but
it
is
interesting
that
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
read
into
it,
some
of
the
ali
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
by
saying
that
you
answer
that
question
by
saying
whether
the
defendant
acted
under
duress,
whether
the
defendant
had
emotional
troubles
and
that
sort
of
things,
so
texas
is
a
fairly
representative
statute
of
this
second
group.
now,
that
has
nine
states
in
it
plus
the
federal
statute.
alright,
now
third
group
of
capital
statutes.
the
third
group
of
statutes
where,
again,
capital
punishment
turns
on
finding
some
particular
designated
fact
or
condition,
but
here
the
fact
or
condition
is
built
into
the
definition
of
the
capital
crime
as
element
of
the
crime
and
here
we
always
have
a
single
verdict
trial
by
the
definition
and
what
we
are
talking
about
is
states
in
which
something
narrower
than
first-degree
murder
is
punishable
by
death,
it
maybe
called
capital
murder,
and
maybe
first-degree
murder
in
five
situations,
but
the
jury
has
to
find
at
the
single
verdict
trial
whether
the
case
falls
within
those
situations.
here
there
are
11
states
and
the
louisiana
statute
is
perfectly
exemplary
of
those
states.
the
final
class
is
the
simplest
to
describe.
it
is
simply
statutes
making
all
first-degree
murder
capital,
using
the
fairly
common
and
traditional
outlines
of
first-degree
murder
that
is
premeditated
and
deliberated
murder,
felony
murder,
the
usual
what
has
always
been
of
some
local
variation.
first-degree
murder
in
this
country
and
there
are
seven
states
in
that
category
and,
of
course,
north
carolina
is
representative
of
that.
my
bottom-line
is
obviously
that
this
court
is
seeing
in
the
five
statutes
here
before
the
court,
although
all
of
these
statutes
are
vary
bit
by
bit,
a
very
representative
set
of
the
capital
punishment
statutes
which
are
now
in
effect
in
this
country.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
minor
point
and
three
major
ones
about
that
general
description.
my
minor
point
is
that
these
statutes
which
were
summarized
in
the
appendices
to
the
briefs,
have
to
be
looked
at
with
some
caution
in
mind
because
they
generally
do
not
fully
reflect
the
local
law
governing
the
application
of
death
penalty.
for
example,
the
georgia
statute
says
in
terms
that
after
a
conviction
of
capital
offense,
the
court
shall
resume
the
trial
and
hold
the
penalty
trial.
but
in
fact
we
know
and
briefs
demonstrate
that,
a
solicitor
at
that
point
can
simply
waive
the
death
penalty
and
there
will
be
no
penalty
trial.
the
brief
of
colorado
public
defender
system's
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
points
out
that
the
similar
colorado
practice
is
simply
to
stipulate
not
to
have
a
penalty
trial
that
practice
is
used
in
texas
as
well
so
that
there
are
variety
of
outlets
that
do
not
appear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
when
the
court
examines
the
description
of
statute
it
would
be
aware
of
that.
secondly,
there
are,
of
course,
general
principles
of
criminal
procedure
that
make
these
statutes
look
differently
than
they
look
on
their
phase.
a
good
example
is
california
where
in
theory,
again,
after
the
defendant
is
convicted
of
a
capital
of
crime,
the
court
if
the
so-called
special
circumstances,
aggravating
circumstances
are
alleged
in
the
indictment,
shall
convene
a
penalty
jury.
however,
there
is
a
general
principle
of
california
criminal
procedure
under
1181
sub-division
7
of
the
penal
code,
that
a
trial
judge
has
complete
discretion
to
strike
from
a
in
indictment
allegations
of
factual
matters
which
enhance
penalty,
so
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
can
be
struck
out
at
the
discretion
of
the
court.
i
simply
am
going
to
give
a
sense
that
the
statute
should
not
taken
as
they
are
written.
there
are
couple
rather
obvious
propositions.
one,
the
statutes
are
tidier
in
print
than
they
are
in
operation
and
number
two,
they
are
a
lot
tidier
at
this
point
in
time
than
they
will
be
if
they
go
on
for
any
period
of
the
time
because
of
the
natural
tendency
of
any
system
to
develop
shortcuts
and
outlets
and
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
the
three
major
points
that
need
to
be
made.
first,
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
at
this
point
in
time
is
therefore
characterized
in
this
country
by
elaborate
winnowing
processes,
involving
a
selective
screening
of
cases
potentially
subject
to
the
death
penalty
and
an
array
of
outlets
for
avoiding
the
actual
use
of
the
death
penalty,
either
by
the
second
stage
penalty
proceedings
in
which
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
either
balanced
or
adjudicated
or
else
by
definitions
of
the
capital
crime
which
narrow
the
capital
crime
and
set
it
off
from
others
along
often
intangible
and
impressionistic
lines.
the
contrast
i
think
is
striking
between
capital
punishment
as
it
is
authorized
by
these
statutes
and
the
next
more
severe
penalty
known
to
our
law,
life
imprisonment,
where
if
you
look
you
will
find
statute
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
life
imprisonment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
sorry?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
all
i
was
saying
at
the
moment
was
draw
to
a
factual
distinction
between
the
ways
in
which
the
states
statute
use
capital
punishment
and
use
life
imprisonment,
it
is
ultimate
thrust
of
my
argument,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
necessarily,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
that
is
the
way
the
states
chose
to
use
capital
punishment,
the
decision
to
have
a
very
narrow
class
of
cases
to
draw
the
lines
to
have
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
i
think
the
very
variety
of
responses
indicate
that
the
states
could
have
responded
by
making
all
crimes,
including
jaywalking
punishable
mandatorily
by
death,
that
would
have
been
response
to
furman
as
well.
the
particular
form
which
the
response
took
was
not
dictated
by
furman,
although
of
course,
the
response
was
a
response
to
furman.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
but
i
think
it
is
remarkable,
even
though
our
submission
does
not
basically
turn
on
the
nature
of
there
legislative
shape,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
the
statutes
are
as
narrow
as
they
are
and
the
contrast
i
am
seeking
to
make
is
between
life
imprisonment
statutes
which
exist
in
52
jurisdictions
in
this
country
for
408
crimes
without
all
of
these
elaborate
post
talk
justifications,
the
special
circumstances,
trials,
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
and
the
very
narrow
roster
of
a
capital
crimes
all
encrusted
with
and
surrounded
by
procedures
which
permit
selective
application
and
draw
the
bottom-line,
wholesale
evasion
of
the
provisions
of
the
death
penalty
statutes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
suggestion
was
certainly
made
that
the
legislatures
might
respond
this
way
and
what
i
am
describing
simply
is
i
think
something
that
one
might
not
have
predicted
which
is
the
perpetuation
of
a
whole
array
of
mechanisms
for
selectivity
after
furman.
you
might
have
expected
simply
that
the
states
would
come
back
and
enact
mandatory
death
statutes,
for
the
most
part
they
have
not.
for
the
most
part,
they
have
come
back
with
these
highly
elaborate
and
articulated
winnowing
devices.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
for
the
moment
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
the
mandatory
statute
is
mandatory
in
any
sense
and
that
is
the
point
i
am
going
to
come
back
to
the
moment,
but
in
specific
answer
to
the
question,
i
do
think
the
form
that
the
statutes
have
assumed
is
indicative
of
something
less
than
a
broad
based
acceptance
of
the
death
penalty
in
our
society.
it
is
a
regular
part
of
the
penal
armamentarium
of
american
society,
life
imprisonment,
yes,
broadly
accepted,
generally
accepted,
no
particular
care
to
winnow
it
down,
but
when
the
death
penalty
is
involved,
all
of
these
selective
procedures.
now
my
second
major
point
is
that
in
addition
to
these
winnowing
devices,
there
are
other
procedures
in
every
state
in
here
i
come
back
the
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes,
so
called
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes,
which
permit
additional
outlets
through
which
potentially
capital
cases
can
be
processed
to
non-capital
conclusions
and
the
dearth
penalty
can
averted
from
some
defendants,
while
being
applied
to
other
defendants
in
distinguishable
cases
on
unaccountable
grounds.
some
of
these
procedures
are
unique
to
capital
cases.
for
example,
the
statutes
may
provide
that
in
order
to
charge
capital
crime,
there
must
be
special
allegations
in
the
indictment
which
the
prosecutor
can
simply
choose
not
include.
some
of
these
procedures
are
not
unique
to
capital
case.
there
are
common
to
non-capital
and
capital
cases,
but
they
assume
particular
importance
in
capital
cases
such
a
commutation,
for
example,
where
the
action
has
always
been
on
the
death
case.
the
attention
or
focus
of
concern,
the
intensity
of
using
that
sort
of
thing
or
the
procedures
very
commonly
found
in
jurisdictions
where
otherwise
lesser
offenses
are
not
submitted
generally,
that
in
capital
trial
the
judge
will
always,
as
matter
of
routine,
give
the
jury
the
lesser
options,
so
that
it
can
let
the
defendant
off
the
death
penalty.
some
of
these
outlets
and
procedures
are
common
in
all
cases,
but
assume
a
particular
character
in
significance
in
capital
cases
for
a
variety
of
reasons
i
am
going
to
come
back
to,
but
the
most
important
of
which
is
that
the
life
death
decision
is
inevitably
enormous
out
of
all
proportions
to
the
factual
differences
in
the
particular
cases
in
which
the
choice
of
life
or
death
is
made
and
the
nature
of
the
decision
by
judge
or
jury
to
kill
a
human
being,
involves
an
intense,
unique,
condemnatory
judgment
that
has
to
be
made
in
often
sensational
atmosphere
of
the
capital
trial.
now,
the
third
point
and
this
will
lead
me
into
the
constitutional
issues
specifically
about
the
general
array
of
statutes,
is
that
i
think
the
difference
is
among
the
states
are
less
impressive
than
the
similarities.
although
these
states
differ
in
technical
detail,
the
government’s
brief
i
think
is
right
in
it
is
amicus
presentation
in
talking
collectively
about
all
of
them
and
describing
all
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
this
country
as
providing,
if
you
will,
the
road
to
death
with
avenues
that
discretionary
mercy
shooting
of
from
the
beginning
of
the
process
to
the
end.
the
avenues
are
different
in
different
jurisdictions.
they
work
differently
as
technical
matter,
but
basically
the
sameness,
the
remarkable
sameness
of
this
process
appears
in
all
of
the
five
records
and
all
of
five
statutes
that
this
court
has
and
in
the
other
statutes
as
well.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
two
constitutional
submissions
which
are
made
by
the
petitioners
jerry
lane
jurek
and
stanislaus
roberts
in
these
two
cases
and
by
the
petitioners
and
the
companion
cases
and
they
are
first,
that
death
sentences
imposed
pursuant
to
systems
of
arbitrary
selectivity
of
this
sort
are
unconstitutional
under
furman.
the
square
a
holding
in
the
furman
decision
rightly
concedes,
compels
that
result
and
secondly
that
apart
from
this
specific
holding
in
furman,
the
death
penalty
as
it
is
used
or
as
it
is
proposed
to
be
use
today
is
an
excessively
cruel
punishment
when
it
is
assessed
against
the
history
of
this
country's
use
of
the
punishment
in
this
century.
now,
these
are
separate
contentions,
although
they
are
closely
connected
and
in
part
three
of
our
brief
in
jurek
we
describe
the
interrelationship
as
best
we
can
between
the
two
arguments.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
misspoke
myself.
i
said
the
death
penalty
as
it
is
use
until
somebody
dies
it
will
not
be
used
and
all
i
meant
by
the
qualification
was
that
states
are
proposing
to
use
it
in
these
cases.
i
put
the
qualification
important
because
we
still
do
not
know
how
these
statutes
will
be
used,
executive
clemency,
further
proceedings
that
sort
of
thing
remains.
all
i
meant
to
say
was
that
we
are
challenging
in
our
second
contention,
the
forms
of
law
under
which,
it
is
now
proposed
to
execute
people
in
united
states.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
precisely
the
second
contention,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
yes!
they
are
both
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
arguments
and
nothing
else.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
distinguish
mr.
chief
justice
between
our
two
arguments.
i
think
that
the
first
argument
does
not
necessarily
assert
that
proposition.
i
think
that
the
first
argument
asserts
that
and
this
is
why
we
have
turned
out
40,
50,
60-page
briefs
in
each
of
these
states,
that
an
accurate,
appropriate
assessment
of
the
way
the
criminal
justice
system
functions
under
the
laws
of
each
of
these
states
demonstrates
a
quality
of
selective
decision
making
which
is
arbitrary
both
in
its
potency,
its
potentially
and
in
fact
in
the
way
which
it
operates,
which
brings
the
capital
punishment
statute
to
those
states
within
the
two
opinions
to
adjourn
or
referrals.
that
not
does
necessarily
say
that
no
other
statute
could
ever
be
drafted
or
any
other
procedure
might
not
be
come
up
with,
that
might
meet
it.
the
second
argument
thus
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
eventually
take
the
position,
mr.
chief
justice
that
one
or
the
other
or
certainly
both
of
those
two
things
in
combination
would
a
render
a
statute
bad
under
the
first
of
our
two
arguments,
but
that
is
not
a
position
that
needs
to
be
taken
in
this
case
because
in
both,
the
jurek
case
and
the
roberts
case
and
in
the
next
three
cases
that
are
coming
up,
we
have
prosecutorial
charging
discretion,
prosecutorial
charged
reduction
discretion,
discretion
by
the
jury
at
a
guilt
phase,
sometimes
at
a
punishment
phase
and
in
addition
a
discretion
at
the
commutation
stage
or
it
maybe
in
louisiana,
you
do
not
even
have
to
formally
have
commutation,
you
do
not
have
an
execution
once
the
governor
signs
a
warrant.
now,
when
all
those
things
are
in
the
system,
our
contention
is
that
the
two
opinions
to
which
your
honor
refers,
outlaw
the
death
penalty.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
at
the
moment
i
am
responding,
i
will
get
there
and
indeed
i
hope
to
get
there
right
now.
let
me
describe
the
texas
statute
for
the
court.
by
the
way,
just
one
word
before
i
do
and
this
is
in
the
nature
kind
of
an
index
through
the
briefs.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
the
primary
briefing
of
this
argument
is
in
part
two
of
the
fowler
(ph)
brief
that
we
did
not
re-repeat
these
arguments.
i
know
it
is
difficult
to
read
and
apologize
for
that.
we
thought
it
would
be
more
difficult,
if
the
court
had
to
read
the
same
darn
thing,
six
different
times.
the
major
argument
about
discretion
and
why
we
think
that
the
system
is
brought
within
the
holding
of
furman
is
made
in
part
two
of
the
fowler
(ph)
brief.
there
is
in
appendix
to
the
jurek
brief
at
the
pages
2-27
and
2-42,
a
further
development
of
that
argument
in
terms
of
the
theoretical
basis
that
we
thought
we
did
not
have
to
establish
again
after
furman,
but
since
the
government
has
made
a
somewhat
veiled
challenge
to
furman
itself,
we
thought
it
was
worth
repeating
in
laying
before
the
court
again
the
theoretical
principle
that
perhaps
the
most
important
function
of
the
eighth
amendment
serves
in
a
democratic
society
is
to
protect
against
penalties
which
are
cast
in
such
a
form
that
through
discretion
in
their
use
they
can
be
applied
selectively
and
sporadically
to
a
numerical
fuel,
so
that
the
ordinary
pressure
is
on
legislation
to
keep
criminal
penalties
descent
or
diffused
and
that
is
found
as
i
said
in
the
jurek
appendix.
now,
the
fowler
(ph)
brief
is
written
in
terms
of
premeditated
and
deliberated
murder,
however,
i
just
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
in
woodson
and
waxton
(ph)
brief,
in
north
carolina
brief,
we
draw
the
parallel
between
felony
murder
and
other
kind
of
murder.
we
thought
it
was
most
useful
to
draw
that
parallel
there
because
the
court
could
thus
compare
north
carolina
law
as
to
both
felony
murder
and
premeditated
and
deliberated
murder.
and
finally,
part
two
the
jurek
brief
and
part
of
the
roberts
brief
discuss
the
specific
procedures
in
texas
and
louisiana
that
we
challenge.
now,
mr.
justice
white
with
my
apologies
for
having
going
amiss
let
me
come
back
and
answer
your
honor's
the
question,
if
i
may,
which
is
the
critical
question
i
think.
let
me
describe
that
texas
statute
involved
in
jurek.
the
texas
statute
is
a
bifurcated
trial
statute,
in
which
capital
trial
is
divided
into
two
stages.
the
first,
to
the
determine
guilt
and
to
determine
specifically
whether
the
defendant
comes
within
one
of
the
five
categories
of
murder
which
are
defined
as
capital
murder
which
make
his
crime
punishment
by
the
death
or
life
imprisonment.
if
he
is
found
to
fall
within
one
of
those
five
categories
and
there
is
a
second
stage,
at
which
the
life
or
death
choice
is
made,
by
the
submission
of
specific
questions
to
the
jury
to
answer.
let
me
start
by
describing
the
second
stage,
the
so-called
sentencing
proceeding
not
because
this
is
the
only
stage
at
which
arbitrary
selectively
enters
into
the
choice
of
those
who
have
not
died,
but
because
an
examination
of
that
stage
will
point
up
how
little
change
has
in
fact
been
made
from
the
statutes
as
they
existed
in
texas
and
elsewhere
prior
to
furman.
the
first
thing,
i
want
to
note
is
that
at
the
outset
of
a
texas
capital
trial,
the
jury
is
death
qualified.
it
is
required
to
be
death
qualified
by
statute
and
it
is
required
to
be
told
prior
to
trial
that
the
question
of
life
or
death
is
an
issue
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
that
furman
governs
that
death
qualification
for
reason
i
think
is
quite
important
realistically
in
assessing
the
texas
statute.
and
i
refer
to
howella
(ph)
case
which
is
cited
on
page
48
in
a
footnote
of
our
brief
in
which
the
texas
court
held
furman
applicable
because
it
said,
“the
fact
remains
that
the
jury
will
know
that
their
answers
to
the
specific
questions,
submitted
at
the
penalty
phase,
will
determine
whether
the
defendant
is
to
be
punished
by
death
or
life
imprisonment.
to
say
that
the
jury’s
answers
would
not
affected
by
their
attitude
toward
the
death
penalty
as
a
punishment
for
crime
simply
because
they
will
not
bring
forth
ultimate
verdict,
simply
because
the
law
attaches
death
to
the
answer
to
factual
questions,
would
be
to
disregard
the
obvious.
now,
in
petitioner’s
case
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
disregard
the
obvious.
in
other
words,
the
court
is
saying
look
everybody
knows
that
when
the
jury
answers
these
questions.
in
petitioner’s
case
the
following
proceedings
occurred
and
you
know
one
of
these
marvelous
things
lets
the
cat
out
the
bag,
page
62
of
the
brief.
during
the
death
qualification
of
the
jury,
the
judge
says
to
the
jury,
trying
to
figure
out
whether
they
are
at
--
explain
to
them
why
they
are
being
death
qualified.
the
questions
you
are
called
upon
to
answers
whether
it
is
two
or
three,
you
must
answer
them
anonymously,
if
they
are
going
to
answer
them
in
affirmative.
in
other
words,
you
must
answer
them
yes.
if
it
is
your
decision
that
death
penalty
should
be
invoked
by
the
court,
not
by
you,
it
is
mandatory
on
the
part
of
the
judge
to
enter
the
sentence.
in
other
words,
under
this
mandatory
scheme
in
which
specific
factual
questions
are
being
submitted
to
the
jury,
what
the
judge
is
saying
to
the
jury
is,
if
it
is
your
decision
that
the
defendant
should
be
sentenced
to
death
by
the
law
then
answer
to
the
question
is
yes.
this
is
the
way
in
which,
in
fact,
the
jury
will
understand
it
and
the
way
in
which
in
fact
the
statutes
operate.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
texas
law
anticipates
one
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
now,
two
of
these
three
questions
and
of
course
the
relevant
questions
are
set
out
at
page
8
of
petitioner’s
brief,
two
of
the
three
relevant
questions
that
are
submitted
for
the
jury’s
consideration
at
the
penalty
phase
are
submitted
in
every
case
without
regard
to
the
evidence
and
one
of
them
is
submitted,
if
it
is
raised
by
the
evidence.
now,
the
first
question,
warning
question
three
whether
the
conduct
of
defendant
causing
death
was
the
committed
deliberately
and
with
reasonable
expectation
that
death
would
result
and
whether
there
was
provocation,
are
questions
which
the
jury
has
already
answered
before
finding
the
defendant
guilty
of
capital
murder
because
the
definition
of
the
category
requires
a
resolution
of
both
of
those
issues.
the
respondent
does
not
dispute
this,
but
simply
says
in
it
is
brief
that
it
would
not
be
a
logical
to
rephrase
substantially
the
same
question
in
other
way
before
imposing
the
death
penalty
given
the
infinite
variety
of
human
conduct
and
the
imprecision
of
the
english
language.
the
plain
fact
remains,
however,
that
the
jury
is
being
asked
to
use
the
same
criteria,
both
to
put
people
into
the
class
of
capital
murderers
and
then
to
the
distinguish
among
those
in
the
class
with
the
result
that
this
a
clear
invitation
to
the
jury
to
deal
inconsistently
with
the
facts
in
it
is
supposedly
factual
answers
to
supposedly
factual
questions
if
it
wishes
to
spare
the
defendant’s
life.
the
second
statutory
to
a
question
is
whether
there
is
a
probability
that
the
defendant
would
commit
criminal
acts
of
violence
that
would
constitute
a
continuing
threat
to
society.
now,
i
am
cannot
rehash
the
obvious
problems
to
that
question
which
we
noted
both
by
the
dissenting
opinions
of
two
out
of
five
judges
of
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
have
been
noted
in
professor
black’s
book.
the
one
thing
that
i
do
want
to
hammer
home,
i
think
it
is
awfully
important
because
i
think
that
the
way
these
statutes
operate
is
the
real
answer
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
and
the
real
to
the
consistency
of
these
new
statutes
with
furman.
i
think
it
is
important
to
hammer
home
how
this
record
shows
this
provision
is
going
to
be
applied.
in
this
case,
the
evidence
on
which
the
jury
solemnly
decide
that
the
defendant,
that
there
was
probability
that
the
defendant
would
commit
criminal
acts
of
violence
that
would
constitute
a
continuing
threat
to
society,
that
evidence
consisted
of
one;
the
fact
that
defendant
have
committed
a
capital
murder
which
of
course
is
true
in
all
cases
and
two;
the
one
line
hearsay
opinions
of
four
local
citizens
in
the
community
that
the
defendant’s
reputation
for
peace
and
good
order
was
bad.
now,
this
case
was
tried
under
this
statute
exactly
the
way
it
would
have
been
tried
before
furman.
the
state’s
position
was
simple.
the
defendant
is
reprobate,
the
defendant
killed
daughter
of
local
peace
officer,
the
defendant
ought
to
die.
those
prepositions
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
submitted
under
texas
statute
which
theoretically
guide
the
jury
sentencing
decision.
in
fact,
however
they
determine
life
or
death
and
the
ironic
thing,
the
thing
that
is
most
devastating
i
think,
is
that
you
cannot
even
challenge
the
jury’s
finding
because
the
question
to
which
it
responds
are
so
meaningless.
you
can
say
on
this
record
that
the
jury
in
this
case
found
without
sufficient
evidence,
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
capital
murder
on
the
theory
of
attempted
forcible
rape.
i
mean,
that
is
a
question
that
has
meaning
and
the
answer
to
it
is
that
the
evidence
here
is
not
sufficient.
that
is
the
kind
of
question
you
can
challenge
and
answer,
but
how
can
you,
even
on
the
absurd
basis
on
which
this
jury
condemned
this
defendant
to
die
for
hearsay
statements
that
the
defendant’s
reputation
is
bad.
how
can
i
say
that
the
evidence
is
or
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
that
there
is
a
probability
that
the
defendant
may
engage
in
the
future
criminal
conduct
that
may
be
a
danger
to
the
community.
the
question
is
to
void
of
intangible
meaning
and
the
answer
is
unchallengeable
and
mr.
justice
white
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
statute
is
exactly
where
we
were
in
furman.
the
issue
of
life
or
death
is
simply
commit
to
a
unfettered
power
of
the
jury
without
accountability
or
review,
the
determination
being
made
in
the
answer
to
supposedly
factual
questions
which
are
simply
predictive
judgments
as
disguised
for
determination
of
life
or
death,
no
less
free,
no
less
in
unfettered,
no
less
arbitrary
than
prior
to
furman.
now,
this
explicit
sentencing
discretion
is
itself
both
precedent
and
followed
under
texas
procedure
by
a
series
of
other
equally
arbitrary
decision
making
processes
that
decide
the
question
of
life
or
death.
the
respondent
again
is
not
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
in
one
sense
it
is
and
another
sense
it
is
not.
to
the
extent
that
furman
is
not
consistent
with
mcgautha
neither
is
our
position,
but
i
do
not
think
furman
is
inconsistent
with
mcgautha.
when
i
come
back
to
deal
with
overall
issue
of
not
only
jury
discretion,
but
also
the
other
stages,
one
of
the
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
and
let
me
anticipate
it
at
this
point
in
answer
to
your
honor’s
question
is
that
what
the
federal
constitution
is
primarily
concerned
with
is
not
specific
state
procedure
in
their
shape
or
form.
it
is
the
total
impact
of
state
process
on
the
federally
protected
interest
and
rights
and
that
is
why
i
think
that
mcgautha
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
way.
i
think
that
we
do
not
have
to
rely
on
that.
i
think
the
jury
discretion
alone
make
this
statutes
bad
under
furman,
not
withstanding
mcgautha
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
what
mcgautha
was
concerned
with
was
the
validity
of
specific
procedures
used
by
the
state
and
our
whole
point
is
that
eighth
amendment
question
is
not
a
due
process
question
of
the
validly
of
this
procedure
or
that
procedure.
it
asked
about
total
impact,
the
result
of
the
state
procedure
on
federally
protected
interest.
now
furman,
some
has
said
is
inconsistent
with
mcgautha,
some
have
said
that
the
jury
discretion
which
was
recognized
in
furman
as
invalidating
the
death
penalty
under
eighth
amendment
was
no
more
or
less
than
the
jury
discretion
that
the
mcgautha
and
how
it
is
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
you
take
that
you
and
i
do
not,
then
our
position
is
inconsistent
with
mcgautha,
but
my
i
am
answer
to
your
question
specifically
justice
stevens
is,
we
would
rely
on
jury
discretion
alone
without
anything
else
if
they
were
nothing
else.
we
think
that
the
is
squarely
controlled
by
furman
and
we
think
that
the
furman
is
not
in
consistent
with
mcgautha
because
furman
is
an
eighth
amendment
decision
which
looks
to
the
consequences
of
jury
discretion
rather
than
simply
whether
the
procedure
is
good
or
bad.
i
would
like
to
talk
to
the
broader
question
of
the
impact
not
only
of
jury
discretion,
but
all
of
these
processes
in
tandem,
not
so
much
in
connection
with
jurek,
but
rather
roberts
because
it
will
be
easier
to
put
them
all
together
there.
so
if
i
may,
let
me
just
describe
now,
the
parallel
process
in
louisiana
and
then
see
if
i
can
draw
it
all
together.
louisiana
procedures
for
the
handling
of
capital
cases
have
much
in
common
with
those
in
texas
and
other
states,
but
they
also
have
certain
localized
features
that
deserve
some
mention.
louisiana
has
unitary
trial
procedure,
a
one
state,
not
a
bifurcated
procedure
and
the
decision
whether
the
defendant
shall
suffer
death
is
made
at
this
single
stage
trial
by
a
verdict
determining
whether
or
not
this
case
falls
within
one
of
five
categories,
designated
as
first-degree
murder
in
the
louisiana
statutes.
prior
to
furman,
louisiana
did
not
divide
murder
into
degrees.
it
provided
that
all
murders
were
punishable
by
life
imprisonment
or
death.
then
as
now,
murder
cases
were
tried
under
a
single
stage
procedure.
then
as
now,
they
were
governed
by
the
characteristic
louisiana
procedure
of
what
they
called
responsive
verdicts.
in
louisiana,
there
is
statute
there
is
a
statute
provides
which
verdict
should
be
submitted
to
the
jury
upon
any
charge
of
a
given
offense.
now,
prior
to
furman,
the
responsive
verdicts
that
had
to
be
submitted
to
louisiana
jury
on
a
murder
charge
were,
guilty
which
carry
the
death
sentence,
guilty
without
capital
punishment
which
is
of
course
a
verdict
of
death
penalty,
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
not
guilty.
when
it
became
apparent
that
this
scheme
has
been
invalidated
by
furman
because
it
offered
the
choice
to
the
jury
of
guilty
verdicts
with
and
without
capital
punishment.
the
legislature
enacted
a
new
law
in
1973
which
now
provides
is
as
follows.
murder
is
subdivided
into
first
and
second-degree.
the
responsive
verdict
statute
has
correspondingly
been
amendment
and
now
on
a
trial
for
capital
first-degree
murder,
there
are
still
four
responsive
verdicts;
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
which
entails
the
death
penalty;
guilty
of
second-degree
murder
which
of
course
averts
the
death
penalty;
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
not
guilty.
like
the
four
responsive
verdicts
submitted
to
the
jury
prior
to
furman,
these
four
responsive
verdicts
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury
in
every
capital
case
without
regard
to
the
evidence
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
slightest
evidentiary
basis
for
finding
the
defendant
guilty
of
anything
less
than
first-degree
murder.
the
jury
is
death
qualified
in
advance
so
that
they
know
the
their
choice
of
verdicts
determines
life
or
death
and
the
bottom-line
in
short
is
that
jury
is
permitted
to
return
a
non-capital,
second-degree
murder
verdict
in
every
first-degree
murder
prosecution.
this
is
called
the
louisiana
law
and
always
has
been.
if
the
court
would
look
at
page
62
and
63
of
brief
in
roberts,
louisiana
supreme
court
puts
it
this
way
under
our
peculiar
jurisprudence
when
trials
for
murder,
the
jury
may
find
the
prisoner
guilty
of
manslaughter,
although
the
evidence
may
show
him
to
be
guilty
of
murder.
next
page;
the
peterson
case.
in
louisiana
where
there
is
evidence
to
prove
the
greater
offense,
it
is
the
jury’s
province
to
determine
the
existent
of
well
known
of
lesser
culpability
and
exercise
the
statuary
right
to
return
a
manslaughter
verdict.
this
court
will
now
look
to
the
evidence
to
make
such
a
determination,
that
is
now
to
a
second-degree
for
which
louisiana
legislature
has
now
upped
the
minimum
penalty
to
40
years
to
life,
so
that
what
is
has
done
in
this
pass
of
legislation
is
in
fact
give
the
jury
a
non-capital
option
exactly
like
they
had
before,
except
the
names
of
the
verdicts
have
been
changed.
now,
it
may
be
useful
here
to
compare
the
practice
in
louisiana
with
that
in
other
states
because
this
louisiana
practice
is
also
quite
common,
although
it
is
not
called
responsive
verdicts
and
there
is
no
statuary
basis
for
it
elsewhere.
some
states
like
florida
for
example
which
is
before
this
court
in
one
of
the
five
cases
always
submit
lesser
degrees
of
homicide
to
the
jury
regardless
of
the
evidence,
just
like
in
louisiana.
the
state's
brief
in
florida
seems
to
suggest
that
that
is
not
so.
that
the
submission
of
less
sentence
depends
on
the
evidence,
but
the
states
pretty
simply
fail
to
draw
out
the
distinction
that
florida
law
draws
which
is
distinction
between
lesser
degrees
of
an
offense
and
lesser
totally
different
offenses.
in
florida
lesser
degrees
of
an
offense
are
always
submitted
without
regard
to
the
evidence
so
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
my
position
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
answer
to
your
honor's
second
question
is
yes,
although
i
would
have
said
it
in
my
view
even
the
narrowest
capital
crime
would
be
assailable
on
this
ground,
if
there
were
total
discretion
with
in
it.
however,
i
could
see
one
who
rejected
that
argument
nevertheless
saying
perhaps
where
a
statute
like
killing
a
guard
by
a
prison
inmate
under
a
present
life
sentence,
something
like
that,
that
may
be
so
narrow
in
terms
of
the
group
that
it
hits
that
you
might
allow
something
in
that
kind
of
the
case
that
you
would
not
allow
for
punishment
for
all
first-degree
murders.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
myself
am
not
arguing
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
one
might
do
it
on
the
ground
that
the
amount
of
arbitrariness
which
is
exhibited
in
practice
might
be
thought
to
be
diminished
by
the
smaller
range
over
which
you
have
to
apply
it.
however,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
would
argue
the
other
way
which
is
that
the
smaller
the
range,
the
more
arbitrary
the
distinction
because
the
cases
by
definition
are
all
the
same
to
start
with,
that
is
they
are
so
close
together
at
the
beginning
that
discretion
within
those
cases
is
more
arbitrary
and
that
is
why,
your
honor,
i
find
it
difficult
to
answer
conclusively
to
the
question,
i
do
not
think
it
makes
a
difference.
in
my
argument,
if
i
were
arguing
that
kind
of
the
case,
i
would
say
even
the
narrowest
beats
a
definition
of
a
crime.
if
it
allowed
total
and
absolute
discretion
to
sentence
the
life
or
death
within
it
or
glossed
over
that
discretion,
papered
it
over
with
these
kinds
of
procedures
would
be
bad.
but
i
could
see,
your
honor,
a
possibility
that
one
might
disagree
with
that,
but
still
not
these
statutes
then
because
they
are
broad.
now,
as
far
as
i
say
in
a
number
of
other
states,
always
submit
as
in
louisiana,
lesser
degrees
without
regard
to
the
evidence.
in
some
states,
like
georgia
and
north
carolina
and
texas
which
are
now
before
the
court,
lessers
are
theoretically
supposed
to
be
submitted
only
where
there
is
evidence
to
support
them.
however,
in
fact
a
couple
of
practices
should
be
noted.
first
of
all,
appellate
decisions
admonish
trial
judges
to
submit,
to
err
on
the
side
of
submitting
lessers
in
any
case
where
the
question
is
doubtful.
secondly,
convictions
of
unsupported
lessers
that
is
if
judge
in
the
case
where
the
evidence
shows
only
first-degree
murder,
submits
second-degree
murder
and
manslaughter
and
the
jury
convicts
of
second-degree
or
manslaughter,
the
appellate
court,
virtually
everywhere
affirms
on
the
ground,
well
the
texas
statutes
says
expressly
that
a
verdict
is
not
contrary
to
law
in
evidence,
where
it
convicts
a
defendant
of
an
inferior
grade
of
the
offense
that
is
proved.
north
carolina
reaches
the
same
result.
florida
reaches
the
same
result
on
the
theory
that
defendant
can
look
at
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth.
now,
but
i
think
the
important
point
here,
we
are
talking
about
defendants
who
are
sentence
to
less
than
death
looking
gift
horses
in
the
mouth,
once
is
a
gift
to
them
is
by
ineluctable
logic
as
professor
charles
black
says,
very
much
less
than
a
gift
to
the
defendant
who
is
does
not
get
grace
and
is
not
spared
and
is
not
in
the
exercise
of
an
equally
unaccountable
discretion,
save
from
going
to
death.
in
other
point,
that
in
a
total
look
at
the
way
capital
punishment
functions
under
the
various
statute
so
to
be
made,
is
that
where
lessers
are
not
submitted,
lesser
degrees
of
murder
as
in
some
felony
murder
case
where
the
evidence
may
make
out
felony
murder
or
not,
it
is
almost
invariably
so,
at
least
for
the
prosecutor
exercising
his
discretion,
chargers
the
felony
in
the
same
trial
that
the
felony
is
submitted
separately
from
the
murder
and
the
jury
has
a
choice
convicting
of
the
felony
and
letting
the
defendant
off
of
the
capital
count.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
louisiana
they
are
always
submitted.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
manslaughter
is
submitted
in
the
felony
murder
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
with
regardless
of
what
the
evidence
is.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
everything.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
by
statutory
command,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
every
case
and
that
as
i
say
it
is
true
in
every
state,
including
florida.
now
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no
louisiana,
the
so-called
responsive
verdict
procedure
in
louisiana
is
statutory
procedure
that
characterizes
each
criminal
trial
in
all,
but
the
statute
814
which
identifies
what
are
responsive
verdicts
has
a
sub-section
dealing
first-degree
murder.
there
is
also
a
sub-section
dealing
with
many
other
crimes.
now,
in
addition
to
the
availability
to
the
jury
of
lesser
offense
convictions
and
other
feature
of
the
system
that
ought
to
be
pointed
out
is
the
often
amorphous
lines
that
separate
the
greater
from
the
lesser.
and
here
again
mr.
justice
stevens,
perhaps
in
answer
to
your
question
another
distinction
that
might
be
made,
although
i
do
not
make
it,
might
be
the
extent
of
amorphousness
of
the
line
between
the
greater
and
the
lesser
that
the
jury
or
the
judge
or
the
prosecutor
has
to
work
with.
mr.
justice
cardozo
pointed
out,
for
example,
the
fact
that
premeditation
and
deliberation
in
such
other
mystical
minnow
concepts,
premeditation
is
different
from
intense
somehow
because
it
must
precede
the
killing,
although
it
means
only
be
a
split
second
before
the
killing
and
justice
cardozo
rightly
pointed
out
that
this
is
simply
a
dispensing
power
conveyed
in
a
mystifying
cloud
of
words,
to
use
his
terminology.
now,
it
may
be
that
a
statue
which
draws
different
lines
more
narrow
might
be
thought
to
be
less
susceptible
to
challenge,
but
these
statutes
and
those
in
united
states
generally
today
are
characterized
by
questions
of
intentionality,
premeditation,
voluntariness,
subject
to
made
allowance.
it
is
important
that
all
of
these
discretionary
procedures
interact
against
the
background
of
the
definitions
of
the
crimes
and
to
come
now
specifically
to
the
bottom
of
justice
white’s
inquiry
about
how
this
all
squares
with
furman.
what
we
have
is
a
system
in
which
often
amorphously
defined
undistinguished
capital
crimes
of
considerable
breath,
narrower
questions
make
come
up
later,
but
now
a
considerable
breath,
are
submitted
to
a
legal
process
in
which
the
decision
to
move
the
defendant
forward
toward
death
or
let
him
escape,
avoid
death
is
made
in
series
of
stages.
with
each
decision
maker
asking
the
question
in
theory,
this
is
premeditation
deliberation
or
not?
was
this
in
a
direct
case
a
killing
in
the
course
of
forcible
rape
or
was
is
not?
but
in
which
in
fear
in
fact,
in
actual
fact
unaccountable
discretion
is
allowed
to
the
following
actors;
the
prosecutor
at
the
charging
stage,
the
prosecutor
once
again
at
the
stage
of
now
processing
or
dismissing,
formally
or
informally
reducing
the
charges,
sometimes
the
trial
judge
has
to
approve
and
sometimes
he
does
not,
but
in
each
case
the
vagueness
of
the
law
gives
him
virtually
no
basis
to
disapprove.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
the
problem
is
that
it
is
the
defendant,
all
defendants
would
want
the
option
of
the
lesser
offense.
this
is
strange
kind
of
a
constitutional
issue
in
which
procedures
which
unquestionably
help
some
defendants
disadvantage
others.
the
procedure
that
your
honor
suggests
or
describes
would
simply
allow
a
defendant
to
gamble
or
not
gamble
on
jury
pardon
or
mercy.
those
defendants
who
gambled
in
one
would
nevertheless
make
the
system
arbitrary
as
to
those
defendants
who
lost.
the
choices
made
by
one
defendant
surely
are
going
to
affect
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
other.
it
is
the
ones
who
end
up
at
the
short
end
of
the
step,
the
ones
who
loose
in
the
lottery,
whose
deaths
are
arbitrary
and
thereby
we
think
under
furman
issue,
giving
the
other
defendant’s
the
choice
which
they
may
exercise
to
get
out
from
under
it,
does
not
seem
to
me
to
affect
the
ultimate
arbitrariness
of
the
result
in
the
case
of
the
defendant
that
gets
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
not
at
all.
it
is
the
fairness
of
the
overall
system
and
that
is
what
i
think
furman
focused
on.
let
me
see,
if
i
can
describe
why
i
think
furman
covers
this
process.
i
do
not
think
furman
was
concerned
with
the
fairness
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
mean,
the
lowest
possible
denominator
of
interpretation
of
the
opinions
in
furman
v.
georgia.
furman
could
not
i
think
had
been
concerned
with
the
fairness
of
the
procedures
in
each
individual
case.
if
it
were,
it
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
mcgautha.
i
think
what
furman
did
was
to
say,
and
this
seems
to
me
very
consistent
with
the
body
of
this
court’s
general
jurisprudence,
that
the
eighth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
two
very
different
animals,
even
though
it
is
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
eighth
becomes
applicable
to
sixth.
as
matter
of
due
process,
the
states
are
given
a
great
deal
of
leeway
to
shape
their
procedures
as
they
met
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
could
quarrel
about
one
form
of
discretion
or
another
nor
said
mcgautha
about
any
form
of
discretion
simply
as
a
matter
of
the
fairness
of
deciding
a
particular
case.
what
furman
said
was
that
when
a
procedure
off
the
sort
resulted
in
an
arbitrary
dispensation
of
death
across
the
total
range
of
those
cases
in
which
it
was
authorized,
so
that
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
on
a
particular
individual
was
senseless.
his
case
indistinguishable
from
that
of
others
who
were
spared,
the
ultimate
imposition
of
that
the
death
penalty
on
him
was
cruel
and
unusual
in
the
constitutional
sense
because
he
was
being
selected
out
of
an
indistinguishable
group
for
no
reason
to
suffer
a
penalty
inordinately
greater
than
suffered
by
others.
no
rhyme
or
reason,
no
justification.
this
arbitrariness
defeated
they
phrenological
justification
for
capital
punishment.
this
arbitrariness
made
the
death
penalty
unusual
in
constitutional
sense
and
it
is
our
submission
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
one
device
or
another
is
used
to
achieve
that
result.
the
federal
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
not.
our
argument
is
essentially
that
death
is
different.
if
you
do
not
except
the
view
that
for
constitutional
purposes
death
is
different,
we
loose
this
case.
let
me
that
very
clear.
there
is
nothing
that
we
argue
in
this
case
that
will
touch
imprisonment,
life
imprisonment
any
of
those
things.
now,
why
do
we
say
death
is
different?
one,
because
this
court
in
furman
said
it
was
different.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
court
did
not
mean
to
strike
down
in
furman
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
20
years,
10
years
although
judges
had
just
this
broad
discretion
to
sentence
to
those
things
or
less
as
they
did
to
life
or
death
under
the
systems
invalidated
in
furman.
secondly,
the
legislatures
of
the
states
have
recognized
that
death
is
different
and
this
is
the
thrust
of
my
point,
that
in
responding
to
furman,
35
legislatures
have
come
back
with
this
narrow,
technical
approach,
allowing
avoidance,
very
careful
winnowing
procedures
that
allow
wholesale
outlet,
whereas,
52
jurisdictions
and
400
made
life
imprisonment
sentence
to
just
you
know
use
the
penalty,
death
is
different,
the
legislature
says
it
is
different.
our
legal
system
has
always
treated
death
differently.
we
allow
more
preemptory
challenges.
we
allow
automatic
appeals.
we
have
different
rules
of
harmless
error.
we
have
indictment
requirements,
the
anonymous
verdict
requirements
in
some
jurisdiction
because
death
is
different
and
finally
death
is
factually
different.
death
is
final.
death
is
irremediable.
death
is
unknowable.
it
goes
beyond
this
world.
it
is
legislative
decision
to
do
something
and
we
know
what
we
do.
death
is
different
because
even
if
exactly
the
same
discretionary
procedures
are
used
to
decide
issues
of
five
years
versus
ten
years
or
life
versus
death,
the
result
will
be
more
arbitrary
on
the
life
or
death
choice.
now,
why
do
i
say
the
result
will
be
more
arbitrary
in
life
or
death
choice?
it
will
be
more
arbitrary
on
the
life
or
death
choice
because
the
magnitude
of
what
it
is
stake
in
choosing
to
kill
somebody
or
spare
them,
it
works
the
factual
differences
on
which
the
decision
is
to
be
made,
renders
them
as
professor
kelvin
in
(inaudible)
said,
the
meaningly
trivial
compared
to
the
states
in
a
way
that
no
such
other
decision
is
unrelated
to
the
factual
basis
on
which
it
was
made.
the
decision
is
different,
the
discretion
is
different
and
the
result
is
different
mr.
justice
stewart
in
a
death
case
than
is
a
case
where
lesser
penalties
are
an
issue
because
as
the
history
of
capital
punishment
under
the
discretionary
system
struck
down
in
furman
shows,
the
death
penalty
has
become
so
repugnant
to
those
who
must
actually
apply
it
in
the
particular
cases
as
distinguished
in
the
abstract
question
how
to
get
on
the
books.
that
in
order
for
a
jury
and
judge
and
a
prosecutor
and
governor
to
condemn
a
defendant,
an
intense
at
furman
in
condemnatory
judgment
has
to
be
made
which
is
very
different
from
the
kind
of
judgment
applied
when
it
is
a
five
or
ten-year
question
which
is
a
judgment,
which
is
uniquely
difficult
to
control,
uniquely
difficult
to
rationalize
or
regularize.
now,
that
combines
with
the
breath
of
discretion
which
is
in
the
system.
some
of
which
is
like
the
discretion
involved
elsewhere
and
some
of
which
is
not,
create
a
total
pattern
whose
result
is
that
the
infliction
of
death
on
specific
defendant
condemned
to
die
is
cruel
and
unusual.
