justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
amsterdam,
before
you
leave
the
jury
point
and
go
on
to
other
aspects
of
discretion,
do
you
think
your
position
on
this
aspect
of
the
pick-array
of
discretion
is
consistent
with
the
mcgautha
holding?
would
you
discuss
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
rephrase
the
question
so
you
have
it
in
mind.
do
you
think
that
the
distinguish
mcgautha,
you
must
rely
on
matters
such
as
executive
clemency
and
prosecutorial
discretion
or
may
you
do
just
within
the
area
jury
of
the
discretion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
amsterdam
let
me
interrupt
again
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
is
this
argument
you
are
making
now
about
that
total
discretion
of
the
jury
to
return
a
non-capital
verdict
depended
all
on
the
size
of
the
category
of
capital
crimes?
supposing
just
one
crime,
say
air
piracy
and
nothing
else
and
assume
for
the
moment
that
your
second
argument
fails,
would
your
argument
about
total
discretion
render
such
a
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
rephrase
it
just
a
little
bit
before
you.
is
your
argument
affected
at
all
by
the
universe
of
capital
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
now
why
would
one
that
and
be
consistent
with
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
the
only
capital
crimes,
is
that
--
characteristic
of
the
criminal
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
amsterdam,
i
should
not
interrupt,
but
a
thought
just
occurred
and
let
me
i
like
to
ask
you
as
it
is
on
my
mind.
again,
focusing
just
on
the
jury
base
and
putting
to
one
side
for
the
moment
the
prosecutorial
and
the
clemency
phases,
do
you
suppose
statutes
such
as
these
would
be
saved
if
the
defendant
were
given
the
option
of
the
asking
for
na
instruction
in
the
alternative,
just
the
capital
verdict
or
not
guilty,
if
the
defendant
were
given
the
option
to
insist
on
their
choice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
really
are
not
concentrating
on
the
fairness
of
the
procedure
in
the
particular
case
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
i
wonder
if
that
is
really
fair
statement
of
his
argument.
he
has
two
separate
arguments
of
course,
but
the
first
argument
as
i
understood
it
was
that
the
under
the
texas
system,
there
is
total
discretion
in
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
other
than
the
one
that
requires
the
death
sentence
and
as
i
understood
his
argument,
he
says
the
first
and
third
of
the
three
aggravating
questions
that
are
submitted
to
the
jury
in
the
punishment
hearing
have
already
been
answered
by
the
jury,
and
therefore,
there
really
is
no
standard
guiding
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
a
response
to
that
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
just
finish
my
thought
about
the
first
to
the
three
questions,
putting
aside
for
a
moment
the
second.
would
it
be
your
view
that
those
15
cases
in
which
the
jury
answered
no
to
the
first
question
at
the
penalty
hearing,
there
was
in
the
record
a
basis
for
differentiating
between
the
kind
of
intent
required
to
support
the
guilty
verdict
of
murder
on
the
one
hand
and
the
kind
of
intent
required
to
satisfy
the
statutory
command
or
would
you,
in
the
alternative,
say
that
this
was
merely
an
exercise
by
the
jury
of
its
power
to
be
lenient
in
a
particular
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
i
wonder
if
you
would
response
to
the
argument
of
mr.
amsterdam
makes
that
if
this
case
is
typical
that
the
evidence
supporting
and
affirmative
answer
to
the
question
number
two
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
offense
itself
plus
four
hearsay
statements
by
local
citizens
that
they
did
not
approve
of
this
man’s
reputation,
that
that
question
really
is
kind
of
escape
hatch
by
which
the
jury
may
exercise
leniency.
you
think
that
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
has
the
texas
supreme
court
told
us
whether
evidence
of
the
offense
itself,
if
it
was
a
sufficiently
heinous
offense
would
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
second
question
of
aggravating
the
circumstance
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
is
it
permissible
argument
for
defense
counsel
to
explain
to
the
jury
that
the
second-degree
responsive
verdict
would
avoid
the
death
penalty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
could
i
just
clear
up
one
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
different
responsive
verdicts,
first
degree,
second-degree
and
man
slaughter,
does
the
trial
judge
--
you
may
have
answered
this,
but
i
do
not
remember,
instruct
the
jury
as
to
he
differences
between
those
offenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
he,
what
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
he
say
on
that
part
of
the
subject?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it,
it
would
cover
a
case
where
there
were
two
people
convicted
of
murder
and
only
one
of
them
fired
the
fatal
shot
and
you
might
have
dispute
as
to
which
one
fired
it,
they
both
be
guilty
of
murder.
a
separate
second
hearing
will
determine
that
the
one
who
actually
fired
the
shot
would
accept
the
capital
punishment,
is
that
the
kind
of
thing
you
had?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
jury
would
have
to
resolve
the
issue
in
the
second
and
need
not
resolve
in
the
first
place,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
i
may
just
interrupt
for
one
question?
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
in
discussing
the
subject
of
discretion,
you
would
differentiate
between
meeting
the
argument
that
mr.
amsterdam
has
advanced
and
meeting
the
holding
of
furman,
if
one
can
identify
it,
if
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two?
certainly
discretion
was
significant
in
that
holding.
i
wonder
if
you
are
attacking
the
decision
or
merely
meeting
an
argument
or
to
what
extent
are
you
doing
one
rather
than
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
let
me
put
another
question
on
the
table.
you
comment
as
you
see
fit
as
you
go
on
in
this
matter
of
discretion.
i
asked
pretty
much
the
same
question
to
mr.
amsterdam.
to
what
extent
do
you
think
furman
properly
understood
rests
on
the
universe
of
crimes,
which
merit
the
capital
punishment
and
is
that
relevant
to
try
to
identify
the
precise
holding
of
a
premise,
you
understand
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
rephrase
it
a
little
bit.
is
the
legal
question
precisely
the
same,
if
you
have
narrowly
defined
capital
offense
in
which
there
are
the
elements
of
discretion
in
the
process
in
a
particular
case
that
the
granted
the
prosecutorial
stage,
affirmance
stage
and
the
jury’s
stage.
is
that
the
same
legal
issue
as
a
case
in
which
the
crime
for
which
the
defendant
was
being
charged
is
one
of
several
hundred
crimes,
which
bear
a
capital
offense,
all
the
way
ranging
from
rape
to
grave
offenses,
before
the
court
or
have
been
before
the
court
from
time
to
time?
is
the
discretion
issue
the
same
in
the
two
different
hypothetical
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
make
sure
i
understand.
your
point
is
that
for
your
argument,
it
makes
no
difference?
do
you
understand
that
it
makes
a
difference
in
interpreting
the
effect
of
furman
in
what
we
have
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
furman
rested
it
all
on
the
wide
variety
of
crimes
which
brought
the
death
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me
one
thing
before
you
finish?
is
it
--
if
it
is
not
necessary
to
overrule
furman,
to
decide
these
cases
as
the
government
contends
they
should
be
decided,
why
not?
why
is
not
furman
controlling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general
did
not
the
standford’s
study
show
a
bias
against
the
blue
collar
workers
(voice
overlap)
white
collar
