chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-5394,
jurek
against
texas
and
75-5844,
roberts
against
louisiana.
mr.
amsterdam
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
point,
i
take
it,
the
point
you
have
made
on
both
of
these
aspects
is
that
there
can
be
no
statute
by
a
state
to
avoid
the
contours
that
would
meet
the
problems
posed
by
the
two
separate
opinions
which
did
not
join
the
plurality
in
furman,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
intimation
is
that
you
thought
that
since
there
is
always
an
initial
discussion
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
and
that
other,
the
far
end,
a
power
of
clemency
by
an
executive,
that
if
those
two
things
are
present
then
no
statute
can
meet
these
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
amsterdam.
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
perhaps
as
regardless
to
another
inmates
and
employees
of
the
prison,
i
suppose
that
is
always
a
possibility,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
babin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
10
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
roberts
against
louisiana.
mr.(inaudible)
you
have
16
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
reversal
for
sufficiency
of
evidence
is
based
on
--
are
you
telling
us
that
if
the
supreme
court
in
its
review
determines
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
verdict,
they
cannot
do
anything
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
on
review
could
on
its
own
initiative,
sua
sponte
determined
that
there
was
some
error,
now
what
is
the
scope
of
hat
kind
of
sua
sponte
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because,
you
have
said
that
the
supreme
court
could
notice
an
error
that
was
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
does
not
include,
you
already
told
us
that
does
not
include
the
power
to
say,
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
here,
upon
which
reasonable
men
and
women
could
find
a
verdict
of
guilty,
they
cannot
review
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
if
the
appropriate
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
that
ground
is
made
then
they
have
the
same
review,
this
petitioner
in
other
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
sir.
they
then
can
review
that
motion
if
were
denied,
yes
sir.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
would
grant
a
new
trial,
if
they
thought
the
district
court
should
granted
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
is
just
a
difference
in
the
mechanism,
not
the
difference
in
the
substance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
(inaudible)
but
along
with
consideration
of
all
the
rebuttal
material
that
will
subsequently
come
in.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
next
75-5491
and
6257
and
5706,
that
is
woodson
and
waxton
against
north
carolina
and
we
will
take
these
up
seriatim.
is
the
counsel
ready
in
5491?
you
are
going
to
rebut
at
this
point.
i
think
mr.
james
is
next
on
and
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
james.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
person
only
testify
in
the
second
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
a
wider
scope
of
evidence,
citations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
telling
that
the
second
jury
does
not
rubber-stamp
the
process
and
simply
declare
all
of
them
are
subject
to
the
death
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
a
hung
jury,
in
the
second
proceeding
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
james.
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
saying
i
take
it
is
that
the
frequency
or
infrequency
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
term
unusual
as
used
in
the
eighth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
i
have
not
seen
this
matters
in
original
argument,
but
simply
response
to
the
suggestion
of
the
petitioners
in
these
cases
and
in
the
prior
cases
that
capital
punishment
is
indeed
out
of
step
with
present
day
thinking?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
possible
that
the
court
might
have
come
to
that
same
conclusion
in
weems,
if
there
have
been
a
more
severe
crime,
that
is
bank
robbery
as
distinguished
from
manipulating
figures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
not
you
think
that
the
supreme
court
in
the
weems
case
at
the
time,
would
have
said
that
about
a
bank
robbery?
if
that
is
a
punishment
had
been
inflicted
for
bank
robbery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
state
singled
out
one
crime
and
said
that
the
killing
of
a
police
officer
in
the
line
of
duty
and
in
the
context
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
by
the
killer,
would
that
and
only
that
would
be
subject
to
mandatory
death
penalty
that
there
is
the
same
breadth
of
discretion,
the
same
kind
of
an
approach
that
were
suggested
in
some
of
the
opinions
in
furman
would
apply?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
precautions,
as
you
described
them
were
generated
by
the
opinion
of
the
courts
in
the
furman
case,
this
is
now
before
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.

amsterdam
