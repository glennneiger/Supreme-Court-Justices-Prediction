mr.
solicitor
general,

justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
your
type,
i
mean
real
life?
i
mean
life?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
not
worry
about
recidivism
then,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
get
it
all
kind
of
cases,
but
i
say
if
an
actual
life
imprisonment,
you
would
not
have
worry
about
recidivism
unless
you
want
get
some
way
out
case
someplace?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
is
subject
to
commit
another
crime,
intends
then
to
be
killed
just
to
prevent
him
from
committing
another
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
not
pick
him
up
the
first
time
and
killed
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice

almost
unlimited,
did
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
in
uniforms?
justice
thurgood
marshall
most
of
the
texas
cases,
they
were
in
uniform,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
this
is
a
second
degree
and
not
first
degree,
as
i
read
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
is
that
by
a
specific
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
just
by
judicial
pr?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
true
before
furman?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
just
has
not
changed
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
granting
all
that,
mr.
solicitor,
that
is
not
the
matter
in
this
case,
but
the
death
penalty
for
drug
dealers
has
not
much
done,
has
it
not,
you
can
just
put
that
as
an
exception
to
the
rule,
would
not
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
figures,
they
did
not
deter
that
drug
people
at
all,
does
it?
