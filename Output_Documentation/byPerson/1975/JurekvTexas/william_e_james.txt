mr.
william
e.
james
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
california
is
here
as
amicus
curiae
and
our
concern
and
interest
has
been
set
forth,
of
course,
in
our
brief
with
the
interest
of
those
who
have
joined
with
us.
we
are
concerned
that
these
petitioners
are
not
going
to
be
content
with
trying
to
get
this
court
to
hold
unconstitutional
the
statutes
that
are
presently
before
the
court
in
these
states,
but
that
they
also
want
an
all
encompassing
decision
of
this
court
declaring
the
death
penalty
unconstitutional
per
se
and
invalidating
all
statutes.
they
seek
to
hold
that
this
court
should
state
that
the
death
penalty
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
violation
of
eight
and
fourth
amendment
and
that
it
is
impermissible
as
to
any
crime,
as
to
any
circumstances
and
as
to
all
times
it
is
impermissible.
we
submit,
as
we
had
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
there
are
number
of
obstacles
to
this
holding,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
its
amendments,
particularly
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
also
there
are
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
impliedly
or
expressly
the
court
has
accepted
this
punishment
as
a
permissible
form
of
punishment.
we
would
urge
that
at
this
time
the
court
take
the
opportunity
to
hold
in
a
case
in
which
an
issue
is
presented
to
them
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se
and
is
not
in
violation
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
clauses
in
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
we
would
also
urge
that
this
court
take
this
opportunity,
if
it
deems
it
advisable,
to
lay
down
guidelines
to
aid
the
states
and
other
and
the
legislatures
of
congress
in
devising
acceptable
standards
for
the
imposition
of
this
punishment.
we
think
that
this
will
certainly
aid
the
case
load
in
the
court
and
prevent
the
states
and
the
parties
from
coming
back
constantly
for
clarification
and
guidance
in
this
difficult
area.
now,
california
has
had
an
unique
experience
in
this
field.
in
1972,
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
were
faced
with
the
legal
and
constitutional
dilemma
that
these
petitioners
would
like
to
have
reflected
on
a
nationwide
scale.
the
california
supreme
court,
contrary
to
the
line
of
the
decisions
in
that
court,
some
of
very
recent
origin,
held
that
the
death
penalty
was
rejected
by
society,
that
it
was
not
serving
a
proper
penal
purpose
and
that
it
was
in
violation
of
the
cruel
or
unusual
provisions
of
the
state
constitution.
the
response
of
the
people
was
fairly
quick.
within
a
few
months
a
petition
was
circulated
for
an
initiative
and
this
petition
obtained
the
signatures
of
almost
a
million
qualified
electors.
this
initiative
would
enable
the
constitution
to
have
a
provision
that
would
hold
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
to
be
deemed
cruel
or
unusual
punishment.
in
november
1972,
the
electorate
passed
this
initiative
by
approximately
67%
of
those
voting
over
5,300,000
people
voting
to
have
this
initiative
ratified
and
the
amendment
made
to
the
state
constitution.
now,
we
are
certain
that
these
petitioners
are
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
the
declaration,
that
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional
just
for
their
crimes
of
murder.
we
are
sure
that
they
are
going
to
demand
that
it
is
entirely
unconstitutional
for
any
crime,
regardless
of
an
enormity
of
the
crime
and
regardless
of
the
legislative
determination
that
there
would
be
some
penal
purpose
served
by
its
availability.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
i
think
it
is
so
much
similar
to
a
group
that
were
mentioned
yesterday.
it
provided
that
the
death
penalty
would
be
imposed,
where
a
person
was
convicted
of
a
first
degree
murder
and
special
circumstances
had
been
alleged
and
proved
and
those
special
circumstances
covered,
murder
for
hire,
killing
of
a
witness
to
prevent
his
testimony,
killing
of
a
police
officer
knowing
that
he
was
a
police
officer
in
enforcement
of
his
duties,
a
killing
that
was
perpetuated,
deliberately
and
intentionally
in
the
commission
of
certain
felonies,
such
as
rape,
robbery,
burglary,
child
molestation
and
kidnapping
and
multiple
murderers.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was
a
bifurcated
hearing
--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
same
jury
would
ordinarily
hear
both
after
the
proceedings
relating
to
the
determination
of
guilt
and
any
plea
as
to
sanity.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
it
can
be
evidence
presented
by
both
sides
on
the
special
circumstances
issue
and
the
statute
also
covered
other
crimes,
for
which
a
death
penalty
might
be
imposed.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
kidnapping
for
robbery,
where
there
is
a
death,
train-wrecking
where
there
is
a
death
and
killing
by
a
life-termer,
where
there
is
a
non-inmate
killed
and
--
mr.
william
e.
james
they
all
involve
homicide.
mr.
william
e.
james
your
honor,
there
are
two
other
statutes
that
were
not
amended
that
called
for
the
death
penalty.
they
were
mandatory
penalties;
treason,
penal
code
section
37.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
determination
of
the
truth
of
the
allegations
of
the
special
circumstances,
which
is
involved
whether
it
was
a
murder
for
hire,
whether
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no
and
the
jury
comes
back
with
a
verdict
true
or
false
or
not
true
on
the
special
circumstances
and
the
penalty
is
imposed
by
the
judge,
according
to
the
verdict.
if
the
verdict
comes
back
that
the
special
circumstances
alleged
are
true
and
the
judgment
is
pronounced
accordingly.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
that
is
right.
the
particular
type
of
the
homicide
that
is
involved.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
could
well
be.
mr.
william
e.
james
you
mean,
the
special
circumstances?
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
in
addition
to
proof
of
guilt
of
first
degree
murder,
in
the
special
circumstances,
the
defendant
must
have
personally
committed
the
crime.
there
must
be
a
willful,
deliberate
killing
and
--
mr.
william
e.
james
not
necessarily
on
a
felony
murder,
where
the
defendant
maybe
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
but
not
a
--
mr.
william
e.
james
normally,
it
would,
yes,
your
honor
and
frequently
in
the
cases
that
have
come
up,
very
little,
if
any
evidence
has
been
presented
at
the
second
phase
and
the
jury
has
been
instructed
that
they
considered
the
evidence.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
is
limited
to
the
special
circumstance
of
issues.
mr.
william
e.
james
not
unless
it
relevant
to
some
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
william
e.
james
oh!
yes,
he
certainly
can
testify.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
there
would
be.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
in
fact,
that
was
the
first
case
that
was
tried,
under
the
statute.
mr.
william
e.
james
they
would
be
both
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
the
question
be
whether
under
the
special
circumstance
allegation,
it
was
shown
that
the
particular
defendant
personally
committed
the
crime
deliberately
and
with
premeditation.
mr.
william
e.
james
approximately.
i
was
advised
last
thursday
that
another
one
was
convicted
and
jury
returned
a
true
verdict
in
san
diego
county,
so
there
maybe
44.
they
are
all
under
the
sentence
under
the
first
degree
murder.
mr.
william
e.
james
you
mean
is
--
mr.
william
e.
james
there
have
been
43
or
44
capital
convictions.
mr.
william
e.
james
whether
at
the
trials
were
they
special
circumstances
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
do
not
have
the
figures
on
that,
your
honor.
there
were
a
numerous
ones,
there
are
instances,
where
the
jury
hung
on
the
second
phase
--
mr.
william
e.
james
where
they
did
not
impose
death?
no,
there
ordinarily
be
a
second
trial
on
the
special
circumstance
hearing.
a
new
jury
selected
under
190.2
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
then
there
is
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
on
the
second?
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
really
would
hesitate
to
tell
you,
because
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
any
statistics
from
the
58
counties
on
that.
i
know
there
are
quite
a
number
in
los
angeles
county,
where
i
came
from
and
there
were
quite
a
number
from
up
north
and
i
have
been
advised
of
instances
where
there
is
a
second
special
circumstance
hearing,
because
of
an
initial
first
jury
being
hung
on
the
issue.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
and
the
second
--
mr.
william
e.
james
you
mean
the
same
jury
in
the
second
proceeding?
that
is
right,
they
have
found
the
defendants
guilty
and
then
have
found
not
true
the
special
circumstances.
the
second
juries,
where
there
has
been
a
hung
jury
on
the
first,
in
some
instances
have
found
the
special
circumstances
not
true,
but
i
have
no
accurate
figures
on
that
matter
at
this
time
your
honor.
we
would
submit
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
impermissible
under
the
eighth
or
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se
that
it
is
our
concern.
we
know
that
the
respondents
in
these
cases
are
going
to
discuss
their
particular
statues
in
relation
to
the
attack
on
it,
but
we
fervently
urge
the
court
to
say
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
an
impermissible
punishment,
that
it
is
at
least
available
to
society
in
appropriate
cases
for
its
protection.
and
we
would
sincerely
urge
that
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
declared
unconstitutional,
that
the
court
consider
these
various
arguments
and
we
also
urge
that
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
abolished,
we
trust
that
it
will
be
abolished
in
the
manner
contemplated
by
the
founding
fathers
and
that
is
by
the
expression
of
the
people,
through
their
elected
representatives
in
congress
and
in
the
state
legislatures.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
will
submit.
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
appear
before
you.
