mr.
john
l.
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
mr.
amsterdam’s
first
point
that
the
system
of
selectivity
such
as
was
condemned
in
furman
still
exists.
we
would
say
certainly
has
applied
to
the
texas
statutes
and
i
hope
that
i
will
able
to
demonstrate
this
before
i
am
done,
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
and
that
the
system
of
selectively
condemned
in
furman
does
not
presently
exist
in
the
texas
statute
either
in
theory
or
the
best
evidence
of
actual
practice.
now,
as
to
his
statement
that
the
prosecutorial
discretion,
jury
discretion,
discretion
on
behalf
of
chief
executives
of
our
state,
that
type
discretion,
no
statute
obviously
can
cure
that
nor
should
it.
as
justice
stewart
observed
in
his
argument,
indeed
thus
prove
too
much.
it
would
be
an
anomaly
to
say
the
least,
if
where
to
condemn
today
in
this
country
as
unconstitutional,
the
very
procedures
that
our
constitution
created,
the
same
constitution
that
created
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
provision
relied
upon
by
petitioners.
it
would
be
an
anomaly
to
say
that
we
cannot
constitutionally
carry
out
a
sentence
today
of
death
in
this
country
solely
because
it
is
being
carried
under
the
very
constitutional
procedures
that
created
this
country
and
upon
which
is
founded.
indeed,
that
argument
proves
too
much
and
i
am
sure
it
will
be
summarily
rejected
by
every
justice.
now
as
to
preposition
that
the
execution
of
the
death
penalty
in
this
country,
regardless
of
circumstances,
regardless
of
the
crimes
that
are
selected
out
by
the
states
by
which
it
has
to
have
application,
the
wisdom
of
state
legislature,
regardless
of
the
procedures
that
are
used,
regardless
of
how
careful
one
may
be,
regardless
of
the
time
span
in
selecting
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
regardless
of
the
impartially
of
the
prosecution,
regardless
of
the
facts,
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
the
crime,
regardless
of
affording
all
the
due
process
for
which
this
country
is
noted,
regardless
of
all
that,
mr.
amsterdam
would
tell
us
that
execution
of
the
death
penalty
in
america
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
even
in
those
events
it
must
be
condemned.
need
one
today,
say
more
to
this
court
than
that
statements
stand
without
any
legal
precedent.
he
stands
utterly
alone.
the
unchallenged
law
of
this
country
as
i
speak
is
to
the
contrary.
indeed,
he
should
carry
a
very
heavy
and
compelling
responsibility
to
ask
the
court
to
overturn
everything
that
ever
been
said
by
this
court
and
other
courts
in
this
country
to
the
effect
that
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
united
states
of
america
today
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se.
the
truth
is
and
it
becomes
more
and
more
obvious
as
this
litigation
proceeds
that
there
are
those
to
hold
very
strongly,
the
view
and
the
conviction,
that
the
death
penalty
should
no
longer
be
used
for
any
purpose
in
this
country.
there
was
a
very
agonizing
statement
by
one
of
justices
of
this
court,
expressing
his
sentiments,
where
that
is
the
only
issue
before
the
case
and
before
the
court,
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
of
us
to
proceed.
that
is
of
course
not
the
issue.
this
court
is
not
a
super
legislature.
this
court
is
not
the
keeper
anymore
than
mr.
amsterdam
is,
of
the
social
values
and
the
conscience,
the
moral
standards
of
the
people
of
this
country,
that
is
why
we
have
a
federal
system
of
government,
that
is
why
we
have
a
republican
form
of
government,
that
is
why
we
entrust
decisions
of
this
path,
subject
always
of
course
to
review
on
constitutional
standards
to
state
legislatures.
now
then,
he
tells
us
that
really
what
has
happened
here
in
texas
is
nothing
more
than
that
we
just
decided
that
there
was
a
person
that
was
a
reprobate
and
that
he
killed
a
young
girl,
whose
father
happen
to
be
a
policeman
and
that
we
decided
he
ought
to
die
and
that
bound
what
made
can
anyone
sees
to
grow
great
to
say
that
about
this
case
in
view
of
this
record.
it
is
the
same
thing
as
conceding
in
questioning
from
justice
stevens
that
in
his
view,
there
could
be
narrowly
defined
circumstances,
narrowly
defined
crimes
by
legislature
which
might
even
meet
his
constitutional
standards.
he
illustrated
with
one,
that
is
a
lifer
in
a
prison
who
takes
the
life
of
someone
working
there,
but
the
theory
seems
be,
let
me
say
what
this
case
is
about,
let
me
say
what
the
texas
case
is
about
and
what
facts
are
if
any.
let
me
say
where
we
draw
the
line.
let
me
determine
what
if
it
should
come
within
the
purview
of
the
capital
punishment
in
this
country.
let
me
decide
what
constitutes
proper
social
goals.
let
me
decide
where
retribution
is
possible
and
proper
and
where
is
not.
let
me
decide,
when
if
ever,
the
death
penalty
will
deter
and
thus
serve
a
legitimate
social
faction
and
let
me
decide
where
and
when
incapacitation
of
a
defendant
is
justified.
and
i
say
to
all
of
that,
may
it
please
court
and
it
is
run
through
both
the
furman
presentation
and
through
this
presentation.
the
basic
fallacy
of
asking
this
court
to
blindfold
yourself
to
any
view
point
other
than
that
expressed
by
the
petitioners,
to
blindfold
yourself
to
any
data
or
evidence
or
experience
other
than
that
to
which
they
point
and
the
standards
for
which
they
have
arbitrarily
established
as
the
guide
post
in
this
case.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes.
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
first
question,
may
it
please
the
court
that
we
ask
on
the
sentencing
stage
and
that
is
whether
the
conduct
is
deliberate,
deliberate
conduct
causing
the
death.
under
our
definition
of
murder,
our
definition
of
murder
is
a
person
commits
an
offense,
if
he
intentionally
or
knowingly
causes
the
death
of
an
individual.
now,
we
had
a
case
brought
under
the
statute
it
happened
in
beaumont
where
an
individual
was
trying
to
break
into
the
jail
and
release
some
prisoner.
he
went
in
heavily
armed
and
he
went
in
shooting,
but
in
the
process
actually
the
policeman
that
was
killed
by
a
guard
that
was
trying
to
resist
the
entrance.
so
in
that
particular
case,
the
jury
convicted
of
capital
murder,
but
found
no
to
this
first
question
of
his,
of
a
deliberate
conduct
causing
the
death.
his
conduct
was
deliberate
in
the
sense
that
he
was
in
and
been
all
mischief
and
shooting,
but
it
was
not
and
it
may
have
been
a
knowing
thing
on
his
part,
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
deliberate
conduct
it
asked
about
in
the
first
question
and
some
types
of
capital
murder
not
in
all.
it
is
a
last
sovereign
look
by
the
jury
where
can
in
fact
be
a
distinction
in
circumstances
of
the
case
and
we
have
15
if
the
court
please,
no
answers
to
these
questions.
they
have
not
been
just
idle
academic
gestures.
the
second
one
that
deals
with
whether
or
not
the
person
will
probably
commit
criminal
acts
of
violence
such
it
would
constitute
to
continuing
threat
in
the
future.
the
last
case
in
which
that
was
answered
no;
there
was
young
21-year-old
black
that
killed
a
white
policeman
in
the
city
of
the
austin.
there
was
some
evidence
presented,
not
sufficient
to
convince
the
jury
that
there
was
a
provocation,
but
there
was
some
evidence
of
a
degree
hassling
and
the
individual
had
no
prior
record
of
any
kind.
he
was
21
years
of
age
and
that
question
was
answered
no
and
his
life
was
spared.
and
so
i
submit
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
question
served
the
valid
purpose
of
trying
first
to
tie
down
that
this
is
a
deliberate,
cold-blooded,
voluntary
type
of
killing
without
any
degree,
if
there
was
any
provocation
at
all,
it
cannot
be
utilized
and
to
try
to
separate
out
those
individuals
who
from
the
type
of
crime
that
they
have
committed,
have
shown
themselves
to
be
likely
recede
of
it.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
there
was
real
difference
in
the
jury’s
mind
in
those
cases.
i
should,
in
fact
my
co-counsel
has
handed
me
a
note
that
i
should
state
to
be
more
clear
on
the
point.
there
were
15
cases
in
which
one
of
these
questions
was
answered
no.
there
were
12
of
those
as
i
recall
my
facts
in
which
it
was
question
number
2,
that
was
answered
no
along
with
the
three
times
that
this
particular
question
was
answered
no.
and
if
i
am
not
correct,
that
is
mr.
pluymen
is
correct.
so
there
were
three
instances
in
which
question
number
one
triggered
the
invoking
of
the
life
sentence
rather
that
the
death
sentence
and
that
were
12
other
instances
in
which
the
question,
on
number
two
was
answered
no
and
that
is
that
person
would
not
probably
commit
criminal
acts
or
violent
acts
in
the
future
as
constituted
continuing
threat
to
society.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
not
at
all.
i
have
cited
first
12
instances
in
where
the
jury
found,
i
recited
the
one
instance
of
killing
of
the
policeman
that
i
believe
is
the
case
in
point
where
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
other
than
the
crime
itself
which
would
have
indicated
recidivism
and
the
crime
itself
was
not
in
the
jury’s
mind
of
such
a
heinous
character
under
the
circumstances
described
as
to
justify
a
yes
answer.
now,
then
in
our
case,
mr.
jurek,
a
22-year-old
white
father,
who
kidnapped
a
10-year-old
white
girl
where
her
grandmother
had
taken
her
for
two-hour
swim
and
had
left
her
in
the
custody
of
the
pool
people,
put
her
in
the
back
of
his
pickup
truck,
ran
her
through
the
city
of
cuero
with
her
screaming
at
the
top
of
her
voice
“please
help
me,”
had
already
told
people
he
was
going
to
get
that
girl
or
one
like
her
that
they
were
not
too
young
to
have
sex
with
and
he
intended
have
it.
he
took
her
to
hill’s
bridge,
got
her
out
of
the
truck,
under
took
the
have
sex
with
her,
choked
her
and
so
she
fell
into
unconsciousness
and
threw
her
in
the
river
and
left
her
to
the
die,
which
she
died
almost
immediately,
went
back
with
his
friends
and
his
beers
with
no
remorse,
came
back
by
the
bridge
with
his
friends
looking
around
in
the
river
to
see
what
he
could
see
and
with
confessions
in
the
record
plus
your
honor,
the
only
we
prove
bad
character
in
texas
in
these
cases
is
by
hearsay.
you
cannot
get
up
on
witness
stand
in
texas
in
the
courtroom
and
say
i
believe
this
person
is
bad.
from
my
experience
you
have
to
be
from
the
person’s
reputation
with
the
community.
so
this
quick
pass
off,
that
it
was
hearsay
testimony
does
not
do
justice
to
this
record.
these
were
four
fine
citizen
of
cuero
that
testified
from
that
his
general
reputation
in
the
community
for
a
being
law
abiding
and
peaceful
citizen
was
bad.
i
do
not
know
how
much
prudence
the
jury
gave
to
the
two
questions
about
the
prosecutor
that
did
you
know
that
he
done
the
same
thing
to
a
girl
in
louisiana
and
one
in
cuero,
before
i
do
not
know
whether
he
had
any
probative
force
or
not.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
they
have
not
and
i
believe
though
that
the
crime
itself
can
show
such
as
incorrigibility,
such
as
free
for
any
remorse.
here
he
was
driving
through
the
town
with
the
girl
in
there.
get
out
on
my
way,
get
off
to
the
road.
he
announced
then
that
he
was
a
menace
to
the
society.
you
can
have
it
by
the
kind
of
conduct
itself,
but
in
this
instance
we
had
more,
but
the
point
is
that
that
kind
of
question
can
be
judged
by
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
already
told
us
that
you
could
have
the
defendant
himself
testify,
you
can
have
psychiatric
test
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
would
likely
be
recidivist
or
not.
there
are
all
kinds
of
the
evidence
and
there
must
be
substantial
enough
evidence
to
support
that
verdict.
that
is
a
point
that
can
be
appealed
directly
to
our
court
of
criminal
appeals.
we
sent
one
case
back,
involving
a
person
of
spanish
surname
today
because
of
the
feeling
that
there
was
inadequate
evidence.
these
are
matters
that
can
be
that
taken
care
of
under
due
process
and
under
equal
protection.
it
has
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
eighth
amendment
and
if
i
might
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
interestingly
enough
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
know
what
you
mean
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
our
source
we
had
a
lifer
who
escape,
you
might
have
read
about
it.
we
just
lost
three
women
as
hostages
in
the
course
of
it
i
guess
life
to
them
was
rather
important
and
to
their
families
and
he
was
a
lifer,
what
did
he
had
to
loose
under
clout
that
the
court
put
as
under
because
we
did
not
know
whether
we
have
a
statute
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
but
to
that
victim
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
the
public
is
entitled
to
make
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
legislatures
of
the
states
on
behalf
of
the
people
they
represent
are
entitled
to
make
that
judgment.
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
has
to
be
unanimous.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir,
it
has
to
be
unanimous
answer
to
all
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
exactly.
mr.
john
l.
hill
exactly.
mr.
john
l.
hill
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
hill
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
limit
other
than
constitutionally
of
the
evidence
under
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
did
and
that
is
almost
unlimited,
but
it
is
limited
mr.
justice
marshall
by
the
united
states
constitution
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
mean
that
it
will
be
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
for
both
parties.
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
the
question
of
recidivism,
it
seems
to
me
is
same
as
question
on
deterrent.
mr.
amsterdam
himself,
it
seems
to
me
acknowledged
the
significance
of
deterrent
when
he
said
that
if
given
a
choice
these
defendant
would
choose
the
life
sentence,
when
he
was
debating
about
whether
or
not
they
should
have
a
choice
during
the
sentencing
process.
and
of
course,
that
just
is
simple
recognition
by
him
of
his
intuitive
extinct
of
human
nature
to
seek,
to
sustain
our
own
life,
the
life
that
we
all
know
is
important
to
every
individual.
that
is
an
extinct
of
every
human
being
and
if
that
be
so,
then
why
is
not
it
and
why
should
not
it
be
allowable
as
the
deterrent,
as
social
goal
of
deterrent
to
prevent
a
lifer
in
a
prison
from
taking
life
with
immunity.
why
should
it
not
be
a
deterrent
to
prevent
someone
who
had
small
child
that
he
intends
to
rape
or
kidnap,
to
have
not
the
incentive
of
his
own
life
to
return
that
child?
why
should
not
we
permit
a
law
in
our
states
such
as
in
texas,
70%
of
our
crimes
under
this
statute
has
with
been
murder
with
armed
robbery,
70%
of
them.
and
incidentally
they
broken,
i
want
to
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
that
from
ratio
of
standpoint
to
show
that
our
statute
once
it
begins
to
operate,
it
operates
free
of
the
any
racial
discrimination.
why
should
not
there
be
a
deterrent
for
a
person
who
goes
to
inconvenience
store
and
undertakes
to
take
someone's
life
not
to
have
the
deterrent
of
his
own
life,
when
he
is
snuffing
out
the
only
eye
witness
to
that
crime
in
most
instances?
so,
i
do
not
want
to
debate
all
of
the
reports
that
are
here
before
you,
and
about
deterrence
and
there
values,
but
i
think
mr.
amsterdam
admitted
the
thing
that
it
appeals
to
our
own
logic
and
common
sense
when
he
said
that
the
criminal
himself
will
always
seek
life
rather
than
the
extreme
penalty.
of
course,
it
is
excessive
in
its
severity,
but
not
in
a
constitutional
sense
and
that
is
where
we
differ.
i
will
take
the
backseat
to
no
one
in
revering
human
life.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
constitutional
question
and
our
very
constitution
created
the
right,
i
submit,
on
the
part
of
our
state
legislators
to
make
this
discriminating
choice,
painful
as
at
it
is,
difficult
as
at
it
is.
we
tried
to
meet
the
objections
and
criticisms
that
this
court
lay
down
as
best
that
we
could
discern
them
and
we
turn
to
a
statute
where
we
selected
out,
murder
first,
murder.
now
under
our
prior
texas
statute
that
you
condemn,
we
could
put
people
to
death
for
rape
alone,
for
rape
alone,
we
could
put
them
to
death.
in
our
old
statute
we
could
put
people
to
death
for
lying
in
a
death
penalty
case.
we
could
put
him
to
death
for
armed
robbery.
we
could
put
him
to
death
for
(inaudible)
or
burglary.
we
could
put
him
to
death
for
treason.
we
had
all
kinds
of
randomness
and
differentials
between
our
treatment.
now,
we
change
that.
our
senate
sat
down
on
the
one
hand
of
the
hall
and
they
wrote
a
statue
done
in
texas
and
put
all
of
the
code
materials
in
about
mitigating
circumstances
and
extenuating
circumstances
and
aggravating
circumstances.
our
house
sat
out
on
other
hand
and
wrote
a
statute
like
north
carolina
and
said
guilt-death.
we
compromised.
we
went
to
a
house
conference.
i
went
over
and
worked.
we
tried
to
pull
over
furman.
we
tried
to
understand
it.
what
did
justice
burger
say
when
he
said
he
might
not
like
a
mandatory
sentence?
what
was
the
right
thing
to
do?
and
we
wrote
in
three,
first
place
we
just
wrote
in
five
categories
of
murder.
the
worst
one
known
as
far
as
calculation
and
design,
murder
for
hire,
when
you
go
pay
for
it.
certainly,
if
there
is
any
state
saying
as
a
crime
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
deter
in
exact
not
an
excessive
punishment,
but
at
least
a
proportionate
one
for
that
type
of
activity
and
we
said
armed
robbery
and
i
have
already
demonstrated
what
a
problem
that
has
been
in
our
state.
the
taking
of
life;
it
is
bad
enough
to
commit
the
crime
of
armed
robbery,
but
the
consistent
taking
of
life
that
is
gone
with
it.
do
you
mean
our
people
have
no
right
in
our
state
to
try
deal
with
that
question
and
with
feeling
that
there
is
some
deterrent
to
this
excessive,
but
constitutional
penalty?
i
mentioned
the
present
situation.
well,
we
already
had
it
in
our
state
and
fortunately,
now
if
this
court
will
say
so,
you
take
our
statute
out
from
under
a
cloud
and
say
to
the
next
person
who
is
a
lifer
in
a
penitentiary
in
the
state
of
texas
that
if
you
kidnap
women
who
are
in
there
teaching
and
you
kill
them,
the
state
has
right
to
ask
you
to
pay
in
a
proportionate
way.
those
are
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
we
dealt
with
under
our
statute,
crimes
arising
out
of
robbery,
burglary,
rape,
arson
and
kidnapping
and
then
we
said
to
our
police
officers
that
we
believe
we
have
a
right
to
set
a
standard
to
say
if
someone
kills
a
police
officer
in
our
state
that
they
know
is
in
course
of
his
job
that
it
is
not
an
excessive
and
severe
punishment
to
ask
for
his
life.
now,
in
that
particular
category
of
cases
under
our
statute,
we
have
had
three
whites
kill
policeman,
two
of
them
received
death,
one
have
received
life.
we
had
one
spanish
surnamed
defendant
kill
a
peace
officer,
hung
jury.
we
had
nine
blacks
in
cases
involving
police
officers,
six
death
penalties,
two
life
and
one
hung
jury.
there
is
no
evidence
that
once
our
system
begins
that
there
is
racial
discrimination.
in
the
armed
robbery
--
sir?
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
that
he
is
in
the
course
of
duty
and
that
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
frankly,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
frankly
wish
i
had
the
answer.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes
sir,
but
i
think
what
justice
stewart
maybe
asking
justice
marshall
that
if
someone
is
impersonating
or
perhaps
you
just
simply
are
not
aware
he
is
a
plain
clothes
officer,
you
are
not
aware
that
he
is
in
the
course
of
duty.
i
would
--
i
will
check
it
for
you
and
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
my
impression
is
that
knowingly
would
be
involved.
now,
in
those
armed
robbery
cases,
we
had
23
blacks
that
were
tried.
ten
of
them
received
the
death
penalty.
we
had
20
whites
tried
for
that
same
bad
crime
and
ten
of
those
received
the
death
penalty.
we
had
nine
spanish
surnamed
defendants
commit
that
horrible
crime
and
six
of
those
received
the
death
penalty
and
one
of
those
is
going
back
on
remand.
so
in
our
category
we
are
70%.
i
am
sorry,
my
light
is
off.
i
could
go
on
to
show
without
any
question
not
only
in
theory
that
the
texas
statute
meet
all
of
criticisms
by
having
these
narrow
categories
with
questions
that
deal
with
recidivism
and
incapacitation
and
deterrence
and
retribution,
but
also
that
in
practice
and
in
actual
practice
it
has
met
those
standards
and
is
working
constitutionally
in
our
state.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
appreciate
that
very
much
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
tried
to
prepare
very
diligently
for
this
matter
and
i
obviously
did
not
do
a
100%
job.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
no.
