justice
potter
stewart
did
the
massachusetts
court
not
also
strike
down
its
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
amsterdam,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
before
you
proceed.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
second
point.
you
qualified
it.
you
said
the
death
penalty
as
composed
to
be
used
today,
what
it
is
that
qualification
mean,
if
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
second
contention
was
broader
that
the
execution
of
a
death
sentence
upon
conviction
in
any
state
of
a
person
of
any
crime
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
no
matter
what
the
technique,
whether
it
be
electrocution
or
hanging
or
shooting
or
gas
chamber
and
no
matter
how
is
serious
the
offense
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
no
matter
how
much
how
completely
a
fair
trial
he
may
have
been
given,
now
is
that
not
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
but
always
the
same
jury
in
texas,
mr.
amsterdam
in
both
phases
of
the
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
always
the
same
by
law,
the
same
jury?
there
cannot
be
a
second
jury
for
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
mr.
amsterdam
that
in
louisiana
the
lessers,
the
lesser
included
offenses
are
always
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
even
in
a
felony
murder
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought?
justice
potter
stewart
and
regardless
of
what
the
evidence
is?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
case,
where
the
evidence
is
either
that
person
is
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
or
innocent,
those
are
the
only
rational
inferences,
nonetheless
the
lesser
included
offenses
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
always
and
invariably
and
inextricably
and
inevitably
submitted
to
the
jury,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
amsterdam,
does
your
argument
not
prove
too
much?
in
other
words,
in
our
system
of
adversary
criminal
justice,
we
have
prosecutorial
discretion.
we
have
jury
discretion,
including
jury
nullification
as
is
known.
we
have
the
practice
of
submitting
to
the
jury
the
option
of
returning
verdicts
of
lesser
included
defense
offenses.
we
have
appellate
review
and
we
have
the
possibility
of
executive
clemency
and
that
is
true
throughout
our
adversary
system
of
justice
and
if
a
person
is
sentence
to
anything
as
the
end-product
of
that
system,
under
your
argument,
his
sentence,
be
it
life
imprisonment
or
five
years
imprisonment
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
because
it
is
a
product
of
this
system,
that
is
your
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
just
has
to
be
affirmative
to
each
of
these
three
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
an
affirmative
to
answer
to
a
single
one
of
them
does
not?
justice
potter
stewart
unanimously
affirmative
to
each
of
the
three?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is
a
negative
answer
by
the
10-12
vote
by
the
members
of
the
jury
(inaudible)
to
anyone
of
the
three
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
death
sentence
cannot
imposed,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
while
i
have
interrupted
you
mr.
attorney
general,
may
ask
you
this?
since
the
statute
has
been
in
existence
has
there
been
an
opportunity
for
sufficient
development
of
the
case
law
so
that
you
can
tell
me
what
limits,
if
any,
are
there
on
the
evidence
that
can
be
adduced
to
this
second
phase
of
the
proceeding,
this
penalty
phase?
justice
potter
stewart
or
surely
it
cannot
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
violation
of
somebodyâ€™s
right
against
compulsory
self-
discrimination
i
suppose
if
he
wants
to
assert
it,
but
and
this
is
unlimited
for
both
parties?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
leave
that
it
is
not
involved
in
the
present
case,
but
you
brought
it
up.
is
there
requirement
under
texas
law
that
the
defendant
had
known
that
the
victim
was
a
police
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
(a)
must
he
know
that
he
is
a
police
officer?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps,
that
has
not
been
decided
perhaps?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
not
relevant
today
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
a
family
argument
would
be
covered
by
first-degree
family
type
of
brawl,
the
kind
your
bar
room
brawl?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
covered,
would
it
not
if
more
than
two
people
were
killed
by
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
if
he
did?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
were
two
or
more
victims?
justice
potter
stewart
they
could?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
under
louisiana
law
is
the
judge
(a)
authorized
or
(b)
required
to
tell
the
jury
the
consequences
of
its
verdict
to
first-degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
he
must
not
and
he
may
not?
justice
potter
stewart
before
we
get
there,
what
is
open
on
appeal
in
louisiana
from
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
mean
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
subjects
are
open
on
appeal
from
conviction
of
a
death
sentence
in
louisiana?
may
the
appellate
court
review
the
degree
of
guilt
and
may
it
review
the
sentence
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
he
be
in
the
appellate
court?
justice
potter
stewart
--
appeal
as
a
right?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
have
a
right
to
reduce
the
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
have
a
right
to
reduce
the
degree
of
guilt
from
first
degree
to
second-degree?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
remand
for
a
new
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
you
found
the
evidence
insufficient
to
support
a
first
degree
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
have
what?
justice
potter
stewart
does
not
it
have
the
power
to
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
assume
a
case,
where
there
just
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
a
first
degree
conviction
and
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
jury
went
haywire
and
so
did
the
trial
judge,
you
mean
to
say
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
have
absolutely
no
power
to
set
aside
that
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
not
directed
to
that.
i
was
not
talking
about
new
evidence,
i
was
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case,
where
the
record
clearly
shows
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
sustain
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
you
have
told
me,
i
think
very
clearly
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
no
power
to
set
aside
a
conviction
in
such
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now
assume
this
it
has
been
grounded
it,
that
when
a
person
appeals,
he
tells
the
court
his
grounds
for
appeal,
i
am
assuming
that?
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
amendment
of
your
state
constitution
by
initiative
petition,
mr.
james,
did
the
legislature
act
then?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
what
kind
of
a
law,
without
going
into
minute
detail,
that
it
enact?
similar
to
any
one
of
these
five
we
have
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
a
single
face
proceeding
or
a
bifurcated?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
same
jury
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
then,
in
the
second
phase
of
this
proceeding,
there
is
another
evidentiary
hearing,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
such
as
--
what
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
all
involve
homicide?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
death?
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
not
to
do
with
the
particular
character
of
the
defendant,
but
rather
the
circumstances
of
the
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
would
not
that
had
been
before
the
jury
in
the
first
phase
of
the
trial
showing
his
guilt?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
would
it
not
always
have
been,
inevitably?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
have
been
before
the
jury
in
the
guilt
phase,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
normally,
the
evidence
show
what
actually
happened
in
this
particular
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
what
would
he
have
to
say,
as
i
understand
that
what
supports
a
death
sentence
in
your
state
under
this
new
legislation
is
not
at
all
anything
to
do
with
the
defendant,
personally,
his
background,
his
education,
his
previous
record,
but
only
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
for
which
he
has
been
found
guilty,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
consider
continuing
into
the
second
phase,
if
the
conflict
between
the
co-defendants
would
certainly
continue
if
one
is
going
to
be
electrocuted
and
the
other
not?
justice
potter
stewart
some
43
defendants
under
sentence
of
death
in
your
state
now?
justice
potter
stewart
how
frequently
is
inflicted
in
the
philippines,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
is
not
just
dis-proportionality,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
switch?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
or
does
it
mean
disproportionate
to
the
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
two
quite
different
things?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
eighth
amendment
is
raised
in
the
question,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
did
involved,
as
you
pointed
out
just
a
moment
ago,
two
different
provisions
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
certainly
is
not
unusual
situation.
it
has
something
that
is
perfectly
permissible
under
one
provision
of
the
constitution,
violate
another
provision
of
a
constitution,
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
different
in
kind
from
any
term
of
imprisonment,
is
it
not,
in
two
or
three
different
respects
at
least
that
it
is
wholly
irretrievable
for
one
thing
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
contrast
to
any
term
of
imprisonment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
may
be
you
made
a
mistake,
you
can
cancel
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
undo
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right
and
it
wholly
discards
any
notion
of
rehabilitation,
of
course.
it
is
different
matter
and
it
is
different
than
others,
not
in
degree,
but
in
kind.
it
is
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it
is.
