mr.
amsterdam
what
did
you
say
was
what
like
what,
the
second
most?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
do
not
think
this
compelled
by
the
holding
in
furman?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
do
not
think
this
is
compelled
by
our
holding
in
1972,
what
you
just
said?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
all
i
am
saying
is
or
asking
was
this
not
compelled,
this
very
thing
compel
by
our
holding
in
the
prior
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
surprised
that
we
have
these
new
statutes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
of
course
selective
application
is
what
you
argued
before
twice,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
cannot
have
been
surprised,
if
you
read
the
opinions
in
1972
because
this
kind
of
thing
was
forecast,
at
least
in
one
opinion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
just
to
save
you
the
trouble
looking,
i
think
i
quote
from
your
code,
“if
the
person
murdered
was
a
peace
office
or
fireman
who
was
acting
in
lawful
discharge
of
an
official
duty
and
who
the
defendant
knew
was
a
peace
officer
or
fireman.”
the
defendant
knew.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
think
it
is
an
obvious
answer.
you
do
not
have
a
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
even
in
weems,
the
court
was
not
unanimous?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
joined
the
dissent?
