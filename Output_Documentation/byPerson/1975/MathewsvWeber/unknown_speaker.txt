unknown
speaker
what
you
just
said
indicates
that
this
precludes
really
magistrates
only
from
comparing
recommended
dispositions,
opinions
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
otherwise
they
can
do
anything
that
may
be
assigned,
but
may
they
do
this
by
general
rule?
is
it
your
submission
would
that
--
that
this
have
to
be
done,
i
mean,
if
they
just
took
this
rule
and
simply
amended
it
and
said
everything
except
the
recommended
disposition
for
example?
unknown
speaker
but
not,
decisions
are
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
mr.
ehrenhaft?
you
suggested
that
it
is
already
in
the
legislative
authority
to
the
magistrate
on
a
closed
record?
unknown
speaker
does
that
imply
that
not
as
a
special
master,
but
simply
as
magistrate,
the
magistrate
has
no
authority
to
conduct
hearings
and
hear
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
because
i
gather
in
dealing
the
social
security
cases?
he
has
no
occasion
or
very
infrequently
or
exceptionally,
i
suppose
ever
to
hear
any
testimony?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
social
security
case.
are
there
others
where
a
single
district
judge
has
reviewed
a
closed
record,
or
agencies
or
something?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
interstate
commerce,
in
which
the
three-judge
court
cases,
as
long
as
that
obtained
i
gather
that
is
all
been
changed
under
the
new
legislation,
but
--
unknown
speaker
--
these
magistrates
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well
i
must
say
that
i
am
looking
at
15
(a),
16
(a),
17
(a),
in
the
petition
as
a
matter
which
this
order
covers
a
lot
more
than
just
dogs?
unknown
speaker
i
believe
this
are
very
comprehensive?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
include
habeas
corpus
matters
which
presumably
is
relegated
to
the
back
burner
in
wingo
against
wedding
anyway?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
limitation
in
the
rule
as
i
read?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
directly
that
involves,
does
it
not
mr.
ehrenhaft,
only
paragraph
a
of
rule
number
1
that
has
15
(a),
does
it
not?
the
petition
that
goes
on
for
pages
but
that
only
its
action
is
to
review
the
most
determination,
or
the
entitlement
of
benefits
under
social
security
act
of
the
statutes,
including,
but
not
limited
to
actions
filed
405
(g)?
