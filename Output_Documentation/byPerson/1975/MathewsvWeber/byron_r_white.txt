except
for
acting
as
a
special
master
would
be
(voice

justice
byron

white
do
you
think
prior
to
that
magistrates
act,
there
could
have
been
rule
of
the
court
that
every
social
security
review
case
will
be
assigned
to
a
special
master?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
so
a
district
court
said
refer
every
social
security
case
to
a
magistrate
even
though
it
could
not
refer
every
social
security
to
a
special
master?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
magistrates
act
says
that
a
magistrate
may
act
as
a
special
master
where
it
is
appropriate
for
a
special
master
to
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
there
is
some
inference
from
the
--
maybe
you
do
not
--
apparently
you
do
not
that
there
are
some
inference
in
the
magistrates
act
that
the
magistrates'
role
in
civil
cases
should
be
no
greater
than
would
be
allowed
to
special
master?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
none
of
them
involves
the
hearing
of
witnesses,
those
long
lists?
