mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
honored
and
surprised
to
be
here,
honored
to
be
asked
to
be
a
friend
of
the
court
in
this
case,
a
bit
surprised
as
i
gather
some
of
you
gentlemen
were
by
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
because
it
does
not
oppose
this
general
rule
adopted
by
the
district
court
on
constitutional
grounds
which
i
had
thought
might
be
a
valid
basis
for
dispute.
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
general
order
adopted
by
the
district
court
does
comport
with
constitutional
requirements
so
there
is
no
further
need
for
us
to
debate
that
issue.
i
agree
with
the
government
that
this
kind
of
a
procedure
is
authorized
by
the
constitution.
we
are,
therefore,
limited
to
a
discussion
of
whether
the
magistrates
act
by
its
terms
authorizes
the
kind
of
procedure
which
the
district
court
adopted
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
in
that
connection,
i
will
discuss
three
points.
one,
what
kind
of
a
case
is
mathews
versus
weber?
what
does
the
statutory
text
say
about
that
and
what
light
does
the
legislative
history
shed
on
that
text?
what
kind
of
a
case
is
it?
well,
this
is
already
been
discussed.
this
concerns
the
review
of
the
determination
by
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
that
mr.
weber
is
not
entitled
to
a
medicare
payment
and
that
decision
is
to
be
reviewed
with
the
view
of
determining
whether
the
decision
is
based
upon
substantial
evidence
in
a
closed
record.
there
is
no
need,
no
opportunity,
no
right
on
the
part
of
either
the
secretary
or
mr.
weber
to
introduce
new
evidence,
to
bring
witnesses
before
the
court,
no
right
of
any
of
them
to
do
anything
other
than
present
legal
arguments
based
upon
that
closed
record
as
to
whether
substantial
evidence
exists
in
the
record.
there
is,
therefore
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
i
do
not
think
so
because
the
rules
with
regard
to
special
masters
is
a
different
rule
than
the
creation
of
the
magistrate
under
the
magistrates
act.
as
i
plan
to
discuss
later,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
magistrates
act
turned
every
magistrate
deciding
a
civil
case
into
a
master.
i
believe
that
its
intent
was
that
if
the
magistrate
is
appointed
as
a
master,
rule
53
applies
to
the
magistrate
when
he
is
acting
as
a
master,
but
the
purpose
of
the
magistrates
acts
was
intentionally
to
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
that
is
right
because
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
that
is
right.
i
think
that
the
authorization
for
the
district
courts
to
use
magistrates
in
certain
capacities
is
not
the
same
kind
of
a
legislative
grant
as
the
authorization
to
use
magistrates
as
masters
when
they
are
to
act
as
masters.
i
think
that
the
procedure
contemplated
by
this
particular
district
court
rule
is
that
the
magistrate
will
recommend
a
disposition
based
upon
his
review
of
a
closed
record
and
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
role
then
is
played
by
a
master
who
may
well
hear
witnesses,
who
may
well
consider
contested
fact
assertions
and
who
is
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
i
do
not
believe
that
either
the
text
or
the
legislative
history
support
such
a
construction
and
i
hope
to
address
that
in
a
moment
sir.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
in
this
particular
situation
with
which
we
are
dealing
here,
he
can
hear
no
witnesses.
he
is
taking
a
closed
record
and
receives
briefs
and
hears
oral
argument,
but
he
hears
no
witnesses.
he,
therefore,
has
no
occasion
to
consider
the
demeanor
of
witnesses
to
assess
credibility.
his
task
is
simply
to
cull
the
record
for
the
substantial
evidence
that
supports
the
secretary’s
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
that
is
exactly
right
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
which
i
am
supporting
specifically
says,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
social
security
review
case.
we
are
not
dealing,
we
will
reserve
for
another
time,
other
kinds
of
cases
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
for
example
wingo
versus
wedding
in
which
this
court
first
considered
the
federal
magistrates
act
was
that
different
kind
of
a
case.
there
was
a
situation
in
which
the
magistrate
was
being
asked
to
hear
witnesses,
to
make
crucial
factual
determinations
in
the
habeas
corpus
context
and
the
court
said
that
that
could
not
be
reconciled
with
the
express
language
of
the
habeas
corpus
act.
this
is
not
a
case
like
tpo
versus
mcmillen
which
the
government
counsel
cited
and
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
after
reviewing
legislative
history.
i
believe
correctly
said
that
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
totally
determines
litigation
is
not
appropriately
submitted
to
a
magistrate
acting
quasi
magistrate
and
this
is
a
case
as
we
have
said,
a
social
security
act
case
where
a
closed
record
is
reviewed
and
a
recommended
disposition
only
is
referred
to
the
district
judge
who
then
can
receive
additional
briefs,
who
can
then
accept
the
recommendation
of
the
magistrate
or
reject
it.
the
fact
that
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases,
the
district
judges
do
accept
the
magistrate's
disposition,
i
suggest
is
not
an
adverse
reflection
on
the
district
judges
that
they
are
thereby
abdicating
their
duty,
but
i
would
hope
a
reflection
of
the
adequacy
of
the
service
being
rendered
by
the
magistrates
and
in
fact
there
are
a
few
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
in
which
district
courts
have
disregarded
or
changed
the
recommended
disposition
urged
by
the
magistrates.
well,
the
importance
of
this
procedure,
i
think
is
highlighted
by
the
administrative
office
of
the
court's
fiscal
year
1975
report.
it
indicates
that
in
1975,
5,800
social
security
act
cases
were
filed
in
the
courts
or
in
a
pace
exceeding
approximately
100
a
week.
of
course
these
cases
are
not
uniformly
spread
throughout
the
district
courts.
there
are
some
in
areas
where
there
are
coal
mines
in
particular
where
black
loan
cases
apparently
have
generated
something
like
559
social
security
act
cases
in
west
virginia
and
in
kentucky
as
well
800,
in
west
virginia
500
and
so
on.
there
is
a
great
concentration
of
those
at
the
present
time
in
those
jurisdictions,
but
even
we
are
talking
--
whether
we
are
talking
about
the
central
district
of
california
which
is
the
jurisdiction
from
which
this
case
arose,
los
angeles,
78
social
security
act
cases
were
brought
in
that
district
court
and
referred
to
magistrates
during
the
fiscal
year
1975.
so,
it
is
a
significant
role
that
magistrates
have
been
asked
to
perform
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
yes.
in
general
order
104,
there
are
a
number
of
additional
kinds
of
cases
that
are
cited.
now,
i
have
taken
a
quick
look
to
see
whether
the
standards
are
the
same
under
those
other
statutes.
in
many
of
them
they
are,
but
i
have
not
really
done
research
to
indicate
to
ascertain
the
extent
to
which
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
well,
i
know
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
i
do
not
know.
i
know
that
there
are
military
discharge
review
cases
that
are
included
in
general
order
104.
there
are
some
nlrb
review
cases
that
maybe
so
referred.
now,
the
extent
to
which
those
also
are
to
be
viewed
on
a
closed
record
as
i
say,
i
cannot
honestly
say.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
without
characterizing
them
necessarily
that
way
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
you
have
put
your
finger
on
an
important
distinction
between
the
cases
that
are
referred
to
the
magistrates
and
rule
53
because
the
reference
to
magistrates,
i
think
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
reference
to
a
master
that
rule
53
is
intended
to
cover.
now,
it
is
precisely
the
routine
case
that
is
the
kind
of
a
case
that
the
magistrates
can
appropriately
look
at
by
reviewing
a
closed
record
and
that
rule
53
was
addressing
a
wholly
different
problem.
that
is
the
exceptional
case
where
the
court
needs
assistance
from
some
outsider
and
i
think
that
rule
53
when
it
said
that
only
the
exceptional
case
may
be
referred
was
drafted
as
it
was
to
avoid
the
abdication
by
judges
of
important
adjudicatory
functions
in
difficult
cases
where
they
did
not
wanted
to
assign
or
felt
that
their
dockets
were
too
crowded
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
clearly
indicates
that
the
congress
recognized
the
validity
of
the
la
buy
versus
howes
leather
case
here
that
reference
as
to
the
masters
were
to
be
restricted
to
the
truly
exceptional
case.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
i
believe
it
preceded
it,
but
i
am
not
a
100%
sure
of
that.
the
concept
that
was
expressed
certainly
has
a
long
tradition
and
there
was
hostility
to
references
to
masters
even
preceding
the
la
buy
case.
as
we
have
said
earlier,
the
language
of
the
magistrates
act
is
not
as
clear
as
it
might
be
with
respect
to
the
additional
duties
that
a
magistrate
may
perform,
but
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
touch
on
one
point
that
government
counsel
made
for
the
first
time
in
his
argument
here
which
concerns
the
use
of
the
words
such
additional
duties
which
he
had
suggested
is
somehow
a
limitation
on
the
duties
of
the
magistrate
because
it
would
refer
to
the
three
illustrative
subsections
of
section
b.
and
looking
at
section
636
of
the
magistrates
act
as
a
whole,
i
note
that
section
636
(a)
indicates
that
the
magistrate
serving
under
this
chapter
shall
have
the
following
duties,
including
those
that
had
traditionally
been
performed
by
united
state’s
commissioners
and
the
power
to
administer
oaths
and
the
power
to
conduct
trials
in
petty
criminal
cases.
636
(b)
then
goes
on
to
say
that
the
district
courts
may
by
rule
established,
assign
such
additional
duties
as
maybe
specially
designated
and
i
believe
the
use
of
the
word
“such
additional
duties”
flows
from
additional
to
subsection
(a)
rather
than
being
a
reflection
of
the
examples
that
are
listed
in
the
following
portions
of
subsection
(b).
what
light
does
the
legislative
history
shed
on
this
statute?
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
not
only
does
a
legislative
history
reflect
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
draftsman
of
this
legislation,
senator
tydings,
representative
poff
and
others
to
provide
as
wide
ranging
a
use
of
magistrate
as
is
consistent
with
the
constitution
and
with
statutory
law,
but
that
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
which
actively
supported
this
legislation
with
the
limitations
that
are
now
contained
in
subsection
(b)
and
which
has
supported
this
legislation
ever
since
has
always
interpreted
it
to
include
precisely
this
kind
of
service
by
magistrates
and
a
subsequent
act
of
congress
raising
the
salaries
of
magistrates,
specifically
referred
with
approval
to
the
duties
performed
by
magistrates
in
reviewing
social
security
cases.
and
i
do
not
say
that
subsequent
legislative
history
is
infallible
or
the
most
appropriate
guide
at
all
to
what
a
previous
congress
meant,
but
i
do
cite
it
to
show
that
it
is
not
in
anyway
inconsistent
with
a
continuum
of
legislative
intent
that
magistrates
be
dignified
as
powered
judges
of
the
district
courts
able
to
assist
judges
in
performing
duties
such
as
those
that
perhaps
not
dogs,
but
in
any
event
of
a
routine
character
which
would
enable
the
district
judges
to
reserve
their
time
and
attention
to
other
matters
more
serious
perhaps.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
my
commission
as
the
friend
of
the
court
is
to
support
the
judgment
below
and
as
indicated
i
think
that
the
00.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
they
are
very
comprehensive
and
it
could
be
that
there
are
situations
in
which
the
district
court
in
its
enthusiastic
embrace
of
the
magistrates
act
has
exceeded
the
balance
which
the
legislature
intended.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
as
i
say
i
have
not
examined
that
list
to
determine
that
because
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
well,
i
would
think
so.
they
are
now
the
--
well,
i
think
that
even
under
wedding,
however,
the
magistrate
is
permitted
to
consider
a
habeas
corpus
petition
and
recommend
whether
a
hearing
should
be
held.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
and
i
do
not
call
whether
general
order
--
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
i
see.
well,
it
could
be
that
the
--
of
course
the
rule
predated
the
wedding
decision
and
would
have
to
be
considered
amended
accordingly.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
there
could
well,
as
i
indicate
be
situations
in
which
general
order
104
is
too
broadly
drafted
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
use
this
revocation
of
this
case
to
provide
guidelines
to
the
district
courts
as
to
how
they
can
under
the
existing
legislation
effectively
use
magistrates.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
well,
i
was
appointed
to
support
the
judgment
below.
the
judgment
below
i
think
in
very
express
language
indicates
that
they
are
considering
this
case
solely
from
the
perspective
of
the
social
security
review
case.
mr.
peter
d.
ehrenhaft
405
(g)
is
very
precisely
the
one
that
we
are
involved
with
here,
yes.
therefore,
to
sum
up
it
is
my
contention
that
if
there
are
no
constitutional
doubts
which
neither
the
government
nor
i
seem
to
have
in
this
case,
the
legislation
is
sufficiently
broad
to
encompass
this
kind
of
duty
and
i
would
place
the
burden
on
those
who
believe
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
so
to
interpret
the
statute
to
change
it
through
congressional
action
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
thank
you
very
much.
