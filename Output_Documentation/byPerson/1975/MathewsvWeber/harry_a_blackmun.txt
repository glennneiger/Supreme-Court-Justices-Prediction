then
you
are
raising
your
constitutional
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
it
made
me
a
little
bit
--
i
am
interested
is
why
is
the
government
so
concerned
about
this?
is
it
fearful
that
there
will
be
more
adverse
decisions
in
social
security
cases
coming
out
of
the
magistrates
pen
or
--?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
governmentâ€™s
interest
is
entirely
pure
rather
--?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
other
one?[laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know,
but
i
gather
the
question
would
be
--
can
we
just
--

a
purest
idea
on
the
part
of
the
