chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-850,
mathews
against
weber.
mr.
kimmel
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assume
that
the
department
of
justice
has
a
certain
minimal
interest
at
least
in
finality
and
that
if
the
procedure
is
not
authorized,
then
there
maybe
some
doubts
at
some
stage
raised
about
the
finality
of
the
determination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
obvious
differences
between
a
pretrial
conference
and
the
trial
that
--
what
would
you
focus
on
is
the
distinction
between
this
initial
exploration
by
the
magistrate
and
the
pretrial
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
one
of
the
final
to
begin
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
a
pretrial
examiner
did?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
initial
step
here
subject
to
reversal
issue
put
it
to
the
district
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
the
procedure
involved
here
that
is
your
challenge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
subject
to
review
by
the
district
judge,
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
an
option
or
is
it
part
of
his
inherent
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
magistrate
in
the
situation
before
us
now
is
exercising
more
or
less
power
if
you
can
make
the
comparison
than
a
bankruptcy
referee
as
traditionally
exercised?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
that
very
much
different
from
the
bankruptcy
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
qualitative,
i
am
speaking
in
a
qualitative
sense,
the
quality
of
the
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
is
dealing
with
a
precise
kind
of
function
that
is
much
easier
definition,
would
you
not
agree
than
a
broad
range
of
authority
that
congress
appears
to
have
at
least
contemplated
for
magistrates?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
kimmel.
mr.
ehrenhaft.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)mr.
ehrenhaft
to
defend
the
entire
general
order
or
only
that
part
of
it
that
relates
to
--
with
the
social
security?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in,
74-850,
mathews
the
secretary
of
hew
against
weber.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
the
judgment
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
