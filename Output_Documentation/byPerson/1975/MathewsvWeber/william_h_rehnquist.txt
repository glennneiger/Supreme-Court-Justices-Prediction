h.
rehnquist
what
is
that
really
mean
when
you
try
to
boil
it
down
in
terms
of
what
goes
on
in
a
courtroom?
what
functions
of
a
judge
are
really
ministerial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
time
do
judges
spend
before
the
magistrates
bill
on
the
housekeeping
attention
to
progress
of
litigation
to
the
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
then
when
you
say
housekeeping
you
mean
discovery
motions
for
a
more
definite
statement,
that
type
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was
basically
a
response
to
your
quotation
of
congressman
poff's
explanation.
i
mean,
the
idea
that
it
was
to
solve
only
the
“ministerial”
and
“routine”
congestion,
now
would
not
solve
much
it
all,
i
would
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
would
dispute
whether
those
can
be
called
either
ministerial
or
routine.
i
mean,
a
pretrial
discovery
motion
can
be
critical
to
the
outcome
of
a
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
true
of
the
challenge
review
of
the
social
security?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
position
has
to
be
that
the
statute
does
not
authorize
what
the
district
court
did
here,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
cannot
really
say
that
perhaps
it
authorized
it,
but
it
is
not
wise
to
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
pretrial
non-dispositive
motions,
it
really
boils
down
to
discovery
motions,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
for
free
of
--
your
cause
example,
frequently
the
cost
is
taxed
against
the
loosing
party,
unless
the
judge
otherwise
provides.
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
a
stronger
case
for
requiring
the
judge
to
do
it.
the
person
who
stands
through
the
testimony
has
some
feel
for
the
equities
of
the
parties
then
perhaps
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
gives
the
impression
what
kind
of
a
dogs
that
were
referred
to
the
masters,
do
you
not
think
to
the
magistrate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
got
two
classes,
civil
rights
act
cases
filed
by
a
plaintiff
appearing
in
proffer,
but
who
is
not
in
confinement
then
in
civil
rights
acts
case
where
plaintiff
is
confined,
but
has
retained
counsel?
