mr.
michael
kimmel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
federal
magistrates
act
authorizes
district
courts
to
refer
all
social
security
cases
to
united
states
magistrates
for
review
and
recommendation
of
its
decision
on
the
merits.
at
issue
is
general
order
no.
104-d
of
the
central
district
of
california.
this
district
court
rule
requires
all
social
security
cases
and
many
other
federal
cases
to
be
referred
to
a
magistrate
for
recommendation
of
a
decision
on
the
merits.
in
regard
to
social
security
cases,
the
rule
requires
the
magistrate
to
review
the
administrative
record,
receive
briefs,
hear
argument
and
submit
a
proposed
decision
to
the
district
judge
together
with
the
proposed
opinion.
the
judge
may
adopt
or
reject
the
proposed
decision
taking
whatever
final
action
he
deems
appropriate.
this
specific
case
arose
out
of
a
social
security
claim
by
respondent
weber
under
the
medicare
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
the
secretary
denied
the
claim
and
weber
sought
judicial
review
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
clerk
referred
the
action
to
a
magistrate
under
general
order
no.
104-d.
the
government’s
motion
to
vacate
the
reference
was
denied
by
the
district
judge,
but
on
the
government’s
motion,
he
certified
his
order
for
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
the
reference
and
general
order
no.
104-d
as
within
the
authority
of
the
magistrates
act.
this
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari.
the
respondent
weber
does
not
take
position
on
the
magistrate
referral
question,
but
the
ninth
circuit
judge
and
he
is
being
supported
in
this
court
by
the
amicus.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
general
order
no.
104-d
is
authorized
by
the
magistrates
act.
in
other
words,
does
the
magistrates
act
permit
or
should
have
been
construed
to
permit
the
referral
by
district
courts
of
all
social
security
cases
to
magistrates
for
a
recommended
decision
on
the
merits.
this
issue
is
important
not
only
to
the
judicial
review
of
social
security
cases,
but
to
judicial
administration
generally.
if
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
upheld
by
this
court,
not
only
social
security
cases,
but
any
case
on
the
administrative
record
and
perhaps
all
cases
on
motions
for
summary
judgment
or
other
dispositive
motion
could
be
referred
to
a
magistrate
for
recommendation
of
a
decision
on
the
merits
under
the
authority
of
magistrates
act.
the
government’s
position
in
this
case
in
brief
is
that
recommendatory
procedure
for
deciding
the
merits
of
civil
cases
established
by
general
order
no.
104-d
was
not
authorized
or
intended
by
congress
when
it
enacted
the
1968
magistrates
act.
we
will
show
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
of
the
magistrates
act,
the
reason
why
magistrates
were
created
was
to
relieve
judges
of
minor
or
ancillary
functions,
so
that
the
judges
would
have
more
time
for
the
careful
performance
of
their
adjudicatory
duties.
our
main
point
is
that
congress
intended
in
this
act
to
give
a
magistrates
limited
or
ancillary
duties,
not
a
central
rule
in
the
adjudication
of
civil
cases.
on
this
basis,
the
government
will
urge
that
dispositive
motions
in
civil
cases
should
generally
not
be
referred
to
magistrates,
but
that
non-dispositive
motions
may
be.
initially,
we
wished
to
note
that
we
share
the
judiciary’s
concern
with
the
tremendous
case
vote
on
district
courts
created
by
just
the
number
of
cases
that
are
filed
every
year,
including
social
security
cases.
our
position
is
not
that
congress
cannot
deal
more
effectively
with
this
problem
by
statute,
including
the
sound
use
of
magistrates.
congress
could
enact
a
statute
which
in
terms
would
authorize
magistrates
to
review
and
recommend
the
decision
in
social
security
cases
or
dispositive
motions
generally.
our
position
is
simply
that
congress
did
not
authorize
such
an
important
and
far
reaching
judicial
procedure
when
it
enacted
the
1968
magistrates
act.
mr.
michael
kimmel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
michael
kimmel
no.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
is
not.
i
do
not
believe
because
of
the
actual
decision
at
least
on
the
basis
of
the
experience
we
had
so
far
under
these
types
of
rules,
it
is
rather
that
we
feel
that
the
procedure
is
not
authorized
by
the
act.
that
if
congress
wants
this
kind
of
procedure
it
should
enact
a
statute
which
would
authorize
it.
it
is
more
a
question
of
whether
it
is
legal
rather
than
a
specific
interest
on
how
the
cases
are
decided.
mr.
michael
kimmel
that
could
be
one
way
of
putting
it,
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
that
the
statutes
should
be
complied
with
by
district
courts
basically.
our
reason
for
a
limited
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
perhaps
in
the
future
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
possibility
if
the
practice
grows.
if
this
particular
practice
grows,
there
may
be
a
question
of
whether
certain
judgments
of
district
courts
are
authorized
if
they
were
in
effect
made
by
magistrates.
that
is
not
our
primary
concern.
that
is
a
possible
concern.
it
is
been
raised
in
some
cases
that
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
there
would
be
a
question
about
--
a
question
of
the
validity
of
judgments
which
are
obtained
under
this
type
of
procedure.
we
do
not
think
that
any
ruling
of
the
practices
unauthorized
though
should
result
in
a
retrospective
decision.
we
think
it
should
be
clarified
at
the
earliest
possible
time
what
does
a
magistrates
act
means
in
this
regard?
now,
our
reasons
for
a
limited
construction
of
magistrates
acts
are
necessarily
based
on
the
language,
legislative
history
and
purpose
of
magistrates
act.
now,
in
terms
of
some
perspective
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
major
purpose
of
the
magistrates
act
was
to
invest
magistrates
with
specific
and
limited
duties
in
the
criminal
area.
under
section
636
(a)
of
the
act
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
magistrates
are
authorized
among
other
things
to
conduct
preliminary
hearings
in
criminal
cases,
issue
search
and
arrest
warrants
and
pose
conditions
are
released
and
exercise
jurisdiction
over
minor
criminal
offenses.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
deals
primarily
with
the
functions
of
magistrates
in
the
criminal
area
and
statistics
of
the
administrative
office
show
that
of
255,000
matters
disposed
off
by
magistrates
in
the
last
fiscal
year,
over
85%
were
in
the
criminal
area.
the
remaining
15%
of
matters
disposed
of
by
magistrates
were
in
the
civil
area
and
were
composed
of
chiefly
of
handling
of
pretrial
conferences
and
prisoner
petitions.
these
numbered
17,000
and
8,000
respectively
in
the
last
fiscal
year.
mr.
michael
kimmel
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
s
1283
is
presently
under
consideration
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
it
was
reported
fairly
by
the
subcommittee
on
judicial
improvements.
if
that
bill
as
reported
by
the
subcommittee
is
enacted,
this
case
would
become
academic,
if
it
is
enacted
because
it
would
specifically
authorize
dispositive
motions
to
be
annulled
by
magistrates
for
a
recommended
decision.
but
a
similar
bill,
i
understand
was
introduced
in
the
house.
it
was
not
approved
as
far
as
i
know
by
the
house
judiciary
committee
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
status
of
the
question
of
the
house
is.
mr.
michael
kimmel
yes
sir.
your
honor
that
was
--
of
course
that
is
the
major
issue
in
the
case
starting
of
that
language.
636
(b)
does
state
that
district
courts
may
assign
the
magistrates
such
additional
duties
as
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
laws
of
united
states.
now,
although
this
particular
language
taken
along
is
capable
of
a
broad
construction,
we
interpret
it
in
light
of
its
context
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
as
reflecting
limitations
and
it
concerned
the
constitutional
doubts
or
impediments
be
avoided.
of
the
senate
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
the
language
itself
thus
say
that
it
cannot
be
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
or
the
statutes.
now,
that
itself
we
feel
merely
reflects
a
conscious
desire
by
the
congress
to
limit
it
certainly
to
those
two
aspects.
now,
the
senate
report
explains
this
language
--
it
explains
of
the
constitutional
qualification
in
section
636
(b)
at
senate
report
number
371,
not
in
terms
of
an
affirmative
for
maximal
grant
of
power
to
district
courts,
but
in
terms
of
a
prohibition
and
a
safeguard
against
potential
abuse.
so
we
believe
that
the
language
was
put
in
more
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
abuses
rather
than
to
extend
maximal
authority
to
district
courts.
the
use
of
the
term
“in
addition
to
such
duties”
rather
than
all
duties
or
any
duties,
again
suggests
a
limited
statutory
intention
rather
than
a
maximal
statutory
intention.
the
amicus
interprets
636
(b)
as
affirmatively
authorized
in
maximal
use
of
magistrates
to
the
full
extent
possible
under
the
constitution
and
statutes.
but
we
question
whether
congress
would
have
left
any
statutory
limitation
if
it
had
really
intended
to
authorize
a
maximal
grant
of
authority
would
more
likely
have
said,
we
think
not
withstanding
any
statute
to
the
contrary,
if
it
intended
to
exercise
maximal
power
in
this
regard.
the
context
of
section
636
(b)
bears
out
we
believe
a
limited
statutory
intention.
three
examples
of
civil
duties
are
mentioned
in
section
636
(b)
and
these
examples
are
limited
in
scope
and
nature.
now,
the
examples
are
not
exclusive.
we
recognize
that,
but
they
are
expressly
described
in
the
senate
report
as
intended
to
illustrate
the
general
character
of
duties
assignable
to
magistrates.
the
three
examples
authorize
reference
to
magistrates
of
special
master
functions
under
the
restrictions
of
rule
53,
assistance
to
the
judge
in
pretrial
and
discovery
proceedings
and
making
recommendations
as
to
whether
there
should
be
a
hearing
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
none
of
these
examples
authorize
magistrates
to
exercise
a
central
role
in
the
adjudication
of
whole
classes
of
civil
cases.
rather
they
authorize
just
limited
or
ancillary
functions
except
in
special
master
cases
under
the
restrictions
of
rule
53.
going
further
in
the
legislative
history,
the
supporters
and
sponsors
of
the
magistrates
acts
explain
section
636
(b)
in
very
limited
terms
at
the
time
this
measure
was
considered
by
the
congress.
one
of
the
bill’s
supporters
representative
poff
stated
at
page
66
of
house
hearings,
many
of
the
duties
that
now
occupy
federal
judges
are
ministerial,
routine
and
minor
yet
nevertheless
time
consuming.
the
significant
feature
of
the
magistrates
act
is
that
it
would
free
a
federal
judge
from
these
less
important
procedural
task
and
enable
him
to
devote
more
time
and
attention
to
matters
of
substance.
mr.
michael
kimmel
all
the
procedural
--
i
would
not
say
ministerial
i
admit,
but
routine
and
not
dispositive
litigation
be
all
the
preliminary
procedural
type
motions
and
the
housekeeping
kind
of
thing
in
regard
to
progress
of
civil
litigations
through
the
courts,
but
not
the
actual
decision
of
civil
litigation.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
i
believe
that
all
procedural
motions
have
to
be
decided
by
a
district
judge
completely,
but
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
yes,
your
honor.
actually
there
is
a
listing
of
the
kinds
of
duties
that
would
be
involved
here
that
are
listed
by
the
administrative
office
in
the
checklist
of
what
magistrates
could
do
and
it
includes
for
instance
general
supervision
of
the
civil
calendar,
including
the
handling
of
calendar
cause,
motions
to
expedite
and
postpone
the
trial
of
cases,
conduct
a
preliminary
and
final
pretrial
conferences,
status
quos,
settlement
conferences,
preparation
of
pretrial
orders.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
i
believe
that
this
listing
of
duties
which
eliminate
from
the
judge’s
burdens
of
a
significant
amount
on
the
number.
for
instance,
of
matters
excluding
the
criminal
which
are
the
main
thing
was
36,000
matters
disposed
of
by
magistrates
in
the
last
fiscal
year.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
i
agree
with
that
and
the
point
here
is
even
when
the
magistrate
does
make
an
initial
ruling
these
are
again
recommendations
which
are
subject
to
review
by
a
judge,
but
particularly
in
the
event
of
an
objection,
but
this
will
eliminate
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
but
there
the
distinction
would
be
the
other
part
of
what
representative
poff
said
that
the
judge,
the
point
of
relieving
judges
of
the
minor
burdens
would
be
so
that
judges
would
have
more
time
to
devote
to
the
actual
substance
of
litigation
--
to
the
actual
of
decision
of
cases
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
thrust
to
make
this
distinction.
the
senator
tydings,
who
was
the
chief
sponsor
of
the
act,
he
explained
at
page
73
that
he
went
so
far
to
say
it
was
intended,
636
(b)
to
relieve
judges
of
some
of
the
routine
non-judicial
burdens.
i
actually
would
not
call
this
acting
on
discovery
motions
non-judicial,
but
the
point
is
the
lesser
type
of
problems
that
used
to
face
judges
all
the
time.
he
also
emphasized
that
district
judges
should
be
able
as
the
result
this
act,
devote
more
time
to
the
actual
writing
of
opinions.
now,
the
senate
report
number
371
is
probably
the
most
informative
statement
of
congress
of
what
it
is
intent
was
in
enacting
this
additional
civil
duties
provision
in
section
636
(b).
the
report
does
not
state
that
congress
intended
to
confer
a
full
or
maximal
power
to
district
courts
to
invest
magistrates
with
several
jurisdictions.
the
reports
based
generally
of
relieving
district
judges
of
some
of
their
minor
burdens
and
of
culling
from
a
district
judge’s
workload,
matters
that
are
more
desirably
performed
by
a
lower
tier
of
judicial
officers.
the
report
further
explained
that
the
reason
why
congress
authorized
flexibility
in
the
assignment
of
additional
civil
duties
to
magistrates
that
is
not
limited
to
the
three
examples
was
not
to
relieve
judges
of
their
adjudicatory
responsibilities,
but
precisely
the
contrary.
so
that
there
would
be
increased
time
available
to
judges
for
the
careful
and
unhurried
performance
of
their
vital
and
traditional
adjudicatory
duties.
now,
one
of
the
vital
and
traditional
adjudicatory
duties
of
judges
is
that
judicial
review
of
administrative
record
cases
under
the
substantial
evidence
standard,
including
social
security
cases.
justice
frankfurter’s
opinion
in
the
universal
camera
case
on
the
responsibility
of
judges
to
review
the
whole
record
in
substantial
evidence
cases
demonstrates
that
decision
of
these
cases
is
not
simply
ministerial
as
the
amicus
asserts
in
its
brief,
but
requires
delicate
judicial
judgment
and
a
first
hand
evaluation
of
the
record.
if
a
judge
contentiously
performs
this
task
in
a
social
security
case,
including
unnecessary
review
and
evaluation
of
the
administrative
record,
it
appears
he
would
be
duplicating
the
work
performed
by
a
magistrate.
if
he
does
not,
it
appears
that
he
would
not
be
exercising
the
adjudicatory
function
which
is
expected
of
him
under
the
magistrates
act.
either
way
the
practice
which
is
authorized
by
this
district
court
rule
seems
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
magistrates
act
to
relieve
district
judges
of
non-essential
functions.
the
dilemma
created
by
this
procedure
was
spotted
by
judge
sprecher
in
the
decision,
tpo
versus
mcmillen
in
which
he
stated,
we
do
not
think
situations
of
this
kind
would
be
remedied
by
the
magistrate
simply
recommending
to
the
district
judge
instead
of
adjudicating.
we
believe
that
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
as
i
say
that
there
is
a
limited
intention
by
congress
not
to
transfer
the
actual
major
responsibility
in
deciding
civil
cases
to
magistrates.
now,
what
congress
did
though
in
the
magistrates
act
in
the
first
example,
that
is
section
636
(b)
(1)
was
to
actually
authorize
magistrates
to
make
a
review
and
recommend
decisions
as
a
special
master,
that
is
under
rule
53.
this
is
the
only
place
where
congress
and
anywhere
focused
on
this
kind
of
a
role
for
magistrates.
but
rule
53
limits
the
reference
of
civil
case
to
special
masters
to
exceptional
cases
whether
detailed
matters
of
account
or
some
exceptional
condition
requires,
if
it
is
meant
to
be
the
exception
of
the
rule.
so
this
particular
authority
which
certainly
not
authorizes
a
blanket
reference
of
all
social
security
cases
to
the
magistrate
as
this
general
order
no.
104-d
calls
for.
we
realized
that
in
general
or
traditionally
the
references
to
masters
has
been
generally
in
cases
involving
fact
finding
functions,
but
we
do
think
that
rule
53
is
limited
just
to
fact-finding
type
of
cases
or
cases
involving
factual
disputes.
we
think
that
rule
53
concepts
involves
reference
of
any
kind
of
a
civil
case
to
a
master
or
hear
a
magistrate
as
master
before
he
recommends
a
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
michael
kimmel
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
typically
the
--
our
problem
certainly
is
not
final
and
in
the
pretrial
it
is
very
definitely
not
final.
the
pretrial
situation
is
simply
to
clarify
issues,
establish
the
basic
routine
and
enter
the
schedule
for
trial,
you
might
say
and
to
limit
unnecessary
witnesses.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
in
the
pretrial
conference
situation
any
attempt
by
magistrate
to
actually
decide
the
case
or
to
purport
to
recommend
how
the
case
should
be
decided.
that
is
a
very
useful
function
of
magistrates
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
i
think
that
the
--
it
would
be
subject
to
reversal
by
the
district
judge.
if
he
purported
to
decide
a
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
mr.
chief
justice
if
it
is
a
pretrial
conference
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
yes.
mr.
michael
kimmel
it
definitely
is
subject
to
review
and
the
district
judge
does
have
the
option
where
he
would
recognize
to
not
accept
the
magistrate's
decision.
we
recognize
this
that
it
is
a
recommended
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
he
has
the
power
both
under
the
rule
itself
and
inherently
as
a
judge
to
decide
the
case,
but
we
think
that
whether
or
not
a
magistrate
actually
is
acting
as
a
special
master
and
comes
under
the
restrictions
there.
the
magistrate
in
this
situation,
under
this
rule
is
still
exercising
significant
adjudicatory
responsibilities
in
these
cases
and
that
is
what
we
say
is
inconsistent
with
general
purpose
of
the
act.
we
do
not
think
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
significant
adjudicatory
responsibilities
even
it
were
cast
in
the
form
of
a
recommendation.
mr.
michael
kimmel
very
definitely.
he
does.
mr.
michael
kimmel
no.
that
is
one
of
the
things.
it
is
not
even
clear
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
that
is
correct
in
most
cases.
mr.
michael
kimmel
the
judge,
we
recognized
from
the
beginning,
has
the
option
to
decide
the
case
and
to
include
a
complete
new
adversary
proceeding
before
him.
that
does
not
a
current
practice,
but
it
is
true
that
this
rule
does
not
go
as
far
as
to
purport
to
have
magistrate
decide
the
case.
mr.
michael
kimmel
your
honor?
mr.
michael
kimmel
in
our
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
in
our
petition
we
did
introduce
some
statistics
which
intended
to
show
what
the
actual
practice
was
and
i
admit
that
they
were
not
very
widely
based
statistics.
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
from
my
own
knowledge
that
the
judge
does
not
usually
schedule
a
complete
new
round
of
proceedings
before
him.
in
fact
there
is
a
great
deal
of
opposition
to
that
suggestion
expressed
by
many
commentators
and
judges
because
they
feel
that
would
definitely
eliminate
the
use
of
the
magistrate
which
is
to
relieve
judges
of
this
type
of
additional
workload.
we
think
that
even
it
were
cast
in
the
form
of
a
recommendation,
congress
did
not
contemplate
this
major
type
of
role
for
magistrates
and
specially
without
--
not
only
saying
so
in
the
statute,
but
not
even
mentioning
it
in
the
legislative
history
that
covered
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
as
i
indicated,
seem
to
indicate
just
minor
functions
were
intended.
now,
where
congress
has
authorized
officials
other
than
judges
to
exercise
significant
adjudicatory
functions
in
the
district
courts
it
has
expressly
said
so.
examples
of
course
would
be
the
referee
in
bankruptcy,
masters
and
court
of
claims
commissioners
where
these
duties
are
spelled
out
at
clear
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
kimmel
probably
be
about
the
same
amount,
i
would
think
your
honor,
although
it
is
true
that
i
believe
under
the
bankruptcy
statutes
the
referee’s
decision
is
clothed
with
finality
unless
a
party
objects
to
the
district
judge.
i
believe
that
is
the
way
it
works.
whereas
the
magistrate
situation,
at
least
under
this
particular
rule,
it
does
not
purport
to
make
it
initially
final
unless
a
party
objects,
but
it
simply
handed
to
the
district
judge
to
approve
or
reject.
that
is
how
it
works.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
it
is
not
really,
but
our
point
here
your
honor
is
that
where
congress
intend
it
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
the
quality
of
the
function
is
probably
about
the
same,
but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
with
example
of
referees
in
bankruptcy
is
that
where
congress
intends
such
a
major
role,
i
think
in
the
official
in
question,
it
is
spells
it
out
and
it
has
with
referees
in
bankruptcy.
their
duties
are
spelled
out
in
detail
in
the
statute
and
they
are
authorized
to
this
first.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
whether
it
is
just
bankruptcy
or
whether
it
all
civil
cases,
both
require
that
there
be
some
definition
by
congress
to
whether
its
intent
--
the
official
in
fact
more.
in
fact,
in
a
case
where
a
magistrate
can
exercise
a
significant
adjudicatory
role
on
a
whole
broad
category
of
litigation
that
congress
at
least
should
indicate
this
that
this
is
purpose
as
intended
in
words
in
the
statute
and
in
turn
in
the
legislative
history.
now,
we
agree
that
transferring
to
magistrates
the
work
of
initial
review
of
social
security
cases
may
additionally
lighten
the
workload
of
district
judges,
and
we
also
do
not
doubt
that
this
may
have
benefits.
but
we
think
a
question
of
policy
is
involved,
although
the
review
of
these
cases
should
be
transferred
to
magistrates.
we
do
not
think
congress
went
that
far
when
it
enacted
the
1968
act
and
at
best
it
enacted
a
general
and
an
ambiguous
provision
which
simply
did
not
come
to
grips
with
this
particular
problem.
if
congress
wishes
to
establish
authority
for
magistrates
to
act
in
this
capacity,
it
should
consider
the
problem
and
enact
the
statute
in
clear
terms
which
would
authorize
it
if
it
thinks
it
is
sound
practice.
mr.
michael
kimmel
should
not
be
construed
or
authorized
it,
yes
or
should
not
authorize
it.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well
i
think
the
wisdom
enters
into
it
in
this
way
that
it
is
a
matter
where
a
policy
question
is
involved.
if
it
is
in
a
statute
some
reflection
of
that
policy
should
be
shown
either
in
the
statutory
language
or
in
the
legislative
history.
it
is
not
shown
in
regard
of
this.
so
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
should
differ
to
congress
and
let
it
specifically
think
what
it
wants
done
with
this
problem.
now,
congress
actually
as
i
mentioned
before
has
a
bill
before
it
which
would
solve
this
problem
and
it
would
authorize
magistrates
to
this.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
bill
that
will
be
accepted
or
rejected
and
in
the
circumstances
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
should
assume
that
congress
has
already
authorized
the
procedure
in
this
genuine
and
guarded
measure
that
it
enacted
in
1968.
now,
in
sum
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adapt
an
interpretation
of
the
magistrates
act
which
would
clarify
three
things
respecting
civil
jurisdiction
of
magistrates.
first,
that
the
act
does
not
permit
the
reference
to
magistrates,
the
merits
of
civil
litigation,
including
dispositive
motions,
except
under
the
restrictions
of
rule
53.
second,
that
the
act
would
permit
the
reference
of
most
preliminary
procedural
or
non-dispositive
motions
to
magistrates
for
review
and
initial
ruling
and
finally
any
ministerial
matter
could
be
referred
to
a
magistrate
for
final
action.
now,
in
social
security
cases
this
would
mean
that
the
judge
have
to
decide
himself
with
the
case.
the
magistrates
would
still
have
though
a
great
deal
of
authority
to
relieve
the
burden
on
district
judges.
the
statistics
of
the
administrative
office
as
i
have
said
reflect
that
some
35,000
matters
in
the
civil
area
--
mr.
michael
kimmel
on
the
merits
of
civil
litigations.
mr.
michael
kimmel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
their
rule
requirement
is
spelled
out
in
the
statute,
i
think
the
statue
contemplates
that
whatever
magistrates
do
be
done
pursuant
to
a
rule
and
i
think
the
rule
would
--
right,
i
think
it
could
specify
all
pretrial
non-dispositive
motions
could
be
referred
to
a
magistrate
where
the
magistrate
could
make
an
initial
ruling
and
recommendations
to
the
district
judge.
mr.
michael
kimmel
not
decisions
that
affect
the
actual
outcome
of
litigation.
mr.
michael
kimmel
that
is
correct
and
that
would
have
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
rule
53.
mr.
michael
kimmel
not
only
discovery,
your
honor.
there
are
a
vast
range
of
other
duties
out
there.
i
have
listed
some,
but
it
is
beyond
discovery.
it
is
true
that
that
would
be
concerning
a
major
area,
but
there
are
many
rules
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
require
action
by
a
judge,
at
various
states
of
litigation,
ought
to
make
a
judgment.
on
cause
for
instance,
where
a
magistrate
objection
to
cause,
where
magistrate
again.
it
is
not
dispositive
litigation,
it
does
not
turn
the
whole
case,
but
he
could
relieve
judges
of
many
functions
in
these
areas.
mr.
michael
kimmel
well,
if
it
does
turn
on
something
that
a
judge
already
would
be
most
familiar
with
then
it
would
probably
not
be
a
sound
idea.
i
would
suggest
in
that
as
an
example
where
to
set
aside
a
cost
bill
maybe
on
technical
grounds
of
one
kind
or
another
where
a
magistrate
could
be
refer
that
problem
to
make
a
--
recommend
a
decision,
but
it
is
not
going
to
affect
the
entire
litigation.
it
is
that
kind
of
a
distinction
i
am
trying
to
draw.
my
time
has
expired,
so
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
resume.
