mr.
kimmel,
you
press
yourself
in
this
language
i
assume
such
additional
duties
as
a
mat
--
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
and
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
also
says
little
later
when
they
outline
and
they
all
said,
but
not
restricted
to,
i
do
not
see
any
limitation
in
there,
it
looks
like
wide
open?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
--
if
the
judge
has
to
pass
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
to
have
oral
argument
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
the
suit
is
filed
the
judge
will
calendar
the
matter
for
oral
argument
before
him,
if
he
deems
it
necessary
or
appropriate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
who
has
the
final
say
on
this,
the
magistrate
or
the
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
practice
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
it
does
not
happen
in
practice.
do
we
have
that
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
record?
