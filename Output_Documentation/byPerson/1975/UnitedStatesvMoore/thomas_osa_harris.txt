mr.
thomas
osa
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
un-liquidated
contractual
claims
of
the
united
states
constitute
a
debt
due
within
the
meaning
of
priority
statute.
now,
we
differ
with
ms.
shapiro.
several
times
she
said,
“all
debts”
and
the
court
says,
“the
question
we
are
talking
about
right
now
is
whether
this
type
of
claim
is
a
debt
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.”
it
appears
to
me
that
there
are
four
factors
very
important
to
the
resolution
of
this
case
and
two
of
those
factors
would
indicate
a
narrow
decision,
a
narrow
interpretation
of
the
statute.
two
of
them
would
indicate
a
more
expansive
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
first
two
involve
the
meaning
of
the
term
debt
due
at
common
law
at
that
time
approximately
when
this
statute
was
first
written.
the
statute
was
first
written
in
the
1780’s
and
has
been
carried
forward
substantially
unchanged
is
that
term.
the
second
factor
again
which
i
think
would
indicate
and
lead
to
a
narrow
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
the
concept
to
the
fairness
of
all
the
creditors
in
this
situation,
including
the
government,
including
the
other
creditors
who
dealt
with
emsco.
the
factors
favorable
to
the
government’s
position
or
a
line
of
cases
indicating
that
this
particular
statute
should
be
construed
liberally
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
government’s
purse.
also
a
line
of
cases
in
which
the
matter
of
priority
has
just
been
assumed
with
no
real
discussion.
ms.
shapiro
has
adequately
related
the
facts
giving
rise
to
this
controversy.
the
only
thing
i
might
add
was
that
this
company,
emsco
screen
pipe
company
was
in
a
failing
financial
situation
when
it
entered
into
these
contracts
with
the
government
and
managed
to
sort
of
prolong
its
existence
on
for
another
couple
of
three
months
and
then
ultimately
went
into
the
assignment
for
benefit
of
creditors.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
well,
yes
sir,
it
does
because
it
has
a
bearing
on
it
in
my
view
because
the
second
factor
that
i
think
is
important
is
the
matter
of
fairness
to
all
creditors.
in
this
case
the
government
was
dealing
with
emsco
on
a
business
basis
just
like
each
other
creditors
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
got
a
different
situation
from
a
taxing
authority
dealing
with
the
tax
recipients
and
tax
payers.
i
might
raise
a
question
--
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
yes,
sir.
that
inquiry
is
required,
generally
in
making
--
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
that
was
one
of
the
disputes
that
arose
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
not
this
trial,
but
at
the
trial
of
the
navy’s
claim
because
the
company
argued
that
there
was
a
misunderstanding
between
the
government
and
the
company
at
that
time
and
that
the
company
was
not
really
financially
able
to
perform
this
contract
and
the
government
was
required
to
make
a
determination
that
it
was
and
there
was
just
some
confusion
in
that
and
the
company
thought
it
was,
but
a
wrong
standard
was
applied
and
it
should
never
been
awarded
this
contract
in
the
first
place.
these
arguments
are
kind
of
detailed
a
little
bit
in
the
brief,
but
the
main
point
that
i
wanted
to
cover
was
whether
the
idea
of
this
un-liquidated
claim
was
debt
due
within
the
statute
in
accordance
with
the
common
law
definitions.
there
was
a
question
as
to
the
time
of
the
time
of
the
liquidation
of
the
government’s
claim
and
the
claims
were
liquidated
soon
after
the
time
of
the
assignment
for
benefit
of
creditors
and
this
lawsuit
was
generated
to
determine
the
applicability
of
the
priority
statute
to
un-liquidated
claims.
the
first
that
i
think
the
most
important
factor
in
the
resolution
of
this
case
and
the
interpretation
of
the
term
debt
was
what
the
term
meant
to
the
framers
of
the
legislation.
and
to
get
some
indication
of
that,
we’re
going
back
to
look
at
the
particular
meanings
of
the
term
“debt”
and
“debt
due”
in
the
common
law.
and
our
argument
is
that
the
common
law
did
not
comprehend
a
debt
as
an
un-liquidated
claim
that
you
could
have
it.
a
debt
where
the
matter
was,
say
on
a
promissory
note,
it
might
not
be
presently
payable,
but
it
was
readily
ascertainable
and
it
was
a
sum
of
certain.
some
force
was
given
to
this
argument
by
a
case
from
this
court
in
1948,
massachusetts
versus
the
united
states.
in
that
case,
massachusetts
was
arguing
with
the
united
states
over,
again
the
proceeds
of
an
assignment
for
benefit
of
creditors.
there
were
two
taxes
that
were
owed.
there
were
federal
unemployment
taxes
owed
and
there
were
state
unemployment
taxes
owed.
and
the
assignee
took
the
position
that
he
was
entitled
to
pay
the
state
unemployment
claims
to
the
extent
of
90%
of
the
government’s,
of
the
federal
government’s
claims
because
there
was
a
provision
in
federal
government
statute
that
you
could
get
90%
credit
for
any
amounts
payable
to
a
state
fund
that
you
have
been
provided.
and
the
federal
government
took
the
position
that
they
could
not
do
that,
that
at
the
time
of
the
insolvency
all
rights
were
fixed
and
you
had
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
unemployment
tax
claim.
this
background
is
important
because
it
bore
on
the
resolution
of
the
problem
by
the
court
in
that
case.
the
court
said
that
you
had
to
look
to
the
moment
of
insolvency
as
to
what
the
situation
was
at
that
time
in
order
to
determine
whether
priority
applied.
you
could
not
look
to
events
that
happened
after
insolvency
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
debt.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
well,
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
liability,
only
to
the
whether
it
was
a
debt
that
time.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
yes
sir,
not
mail.
at
the
time
of
the
insolvency,
of
course
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
amount
was
owing
to
the
government
and
at
that
particular
time
it
could
have
worked
out
in
a
number
ways
so
that
--
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
yes
sir.
actually
two
judges
on
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
you
--
what
you
have
to
do
is
look
to
see
the
time
of
insolvency
as
to
whether
it
was
a
debt,
presently
payable
or
not.
i
think
that
was
to
some
extent
erroneous
in
making
the
debt
be
presently
payable
because
that
was
not
a
necessary
requirement
of
the
common
law
term
“debt”
because
the
common
law
term
included
debts
that
were
presently
payable
and
debts
meaning
a
sum
certain
that
would
be
payable
at
a
designated
time
in
the
future
and
the
only
thing
he
had
to
do
was
wait
for
the
time
to
pass.
there
was
no
happening
of
the
subsequent
event
that
would
liquidate
the
damages.
in
the
massachusetts
case,
the
language
that
we
rely
on
is
as
following.
it
says
it
is
at
least
doubtful
on
the
statute's
wording
that
obligations
wholly
contingent
for
ultimate
maturity
and
obligation
upon
the
happening
of
events
after
insolvency
can
be
said
to
fall
within
the
reach
of
debts
due
at
the
time
of
insolvency.
and
further
it
says
that
congress
drew
the
line
for
the
operation
of
the
statute
close
to,
if
not
at,
the
commonly
accepted
meaning
of
debt
as
distinguished
from
other
forms
of
obligation.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
well,
when
i
first
got
involved
in
this,
i
thought
it
was
just
dicta
but
then
as
i
become
more
closely
acquainted
with
the
case,
i
think
that
that
was
an
integral
part
of
the
holding
or
at
least
an
integral
part
of
an
alternative
reasoning
because
the
--
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
well,
i
think
that
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
that
was
indicated
in
massachusetts
was
that
you
look
at
the
time
that
the
events,
at
the
time
of
the
insolvency
and
if
you
have
to
look
to
subsequent
events,
contingent
advances
as
cause
them
in
that
language,
then
it
was
not,
it
would
not
be
at
debt
due
in
the
common
law.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
that
is
correct.
the
obligation
was
fixed,
but
the
thing
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
events
beyond
the
time
of
insolvency
in
order
to
determine,
really
whether
there
was
any
obligation
because
damages
could
have
been
zero
on
the
thing
on
that,
and
i
suppose
that
maybe
a
metaphysical
way
of
approaching
it,
but
if
you
have
to
look
at
events
subsequent
to
the
time
of
question
then
it
would
not
be
a
debt
in
accordance
with
the
common
law
thinking.
another
case
that
we
think
bears
on
this
case
is
the
case
of
united
states
versus
state
bank
of
north
carolina
which
was
decided
in
1832.
that
case
involved
a
customs
bond
which
was
executed
before
the
insolvency,
payable
after
the
insolvency.
and
justice
story
said
that
this
was
nonetheless
a
debt
due,
even
though
it
was
not
presently
payable.
to
get
to
that
result,
he
went
to
some
common
law
thinking
and
he
said,
“you
know,
if
you
want
to
know
what
debt
means,
look
to
the
common
law
and
we
are
going
to
apply
it
in
the
sense
of
the
common
law
term,
meaning
a
debt
presently
payable,
excuse
me
a
present
a
debt,
that
is
presently
obligated,
but
payable
in
the
future.”
the
emphasis
was
that
you
did
not
look
to
subsequent
events.
keying
in
on
that
particular
language,
it
is
in
latin,
i
could
not
pronounce
it
too
well,
but
it
is
debitum
in
presenti,
solvendum
in
futuro
or
something,
keying
in
on
that
language,
i
looked
at
other
cases
and
brought
them
before
the
court
in
my
brief
and
those
other
cases
also
stress
the
importance
that
to
the
--
in
the
concept
of
the
language
at
that
time
that
it
was
written
in
the
statute,
you
could
not
look
or
you
should
not
look
to
events
after
the
time
of
the
insolvency
to
determine
if
it
was
a
debt
or
not.
debts
and
i
am
convinced
that
debts
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
meant
things
like
promissory
notes,
bonds,
that
type
of
fixed
sum
sort
of
obligation.
there
has
been
some
discussion
as
to
taxes,
as
to
whether
they
are
debts
or
debts
due,
there
have
been
previous
cases
out
of
this
court
that
have
indicated
taxes
are
certainly
a
debt
due
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
yes
sir
because
the
events
that
have
generated
the
tax
have
happened
at
the
time
of
the
particular
insolvency.
they
may
be
disputed,
take
a
net
worth
case.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
well
the
tax
case,
at
the
time
of
the
insolvency,
you
have
got
all
the
facts
you
need.
you
can
work
out
the
dispute.
you
can
figure
out
what
the
tax
is
as
of
that
particular
moment
whereas
in
the
instant
case,
you
cannot
do
that
until
the
subsequent
event
after
insolvency
takes
place
and
that
subsequent
is
a
repurchase
of
the
contract.
it
could
be
that
there
would
be
no
damages.
i
would
--
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
well,
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
a
debt
due
because
you
still
have
to
look
to
the
subsequent
event.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
proving
up
what
the
damages
were.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
no,
sir.
let
me
back
up
a
second.
i
think
that
if
you
have
a
liquidated
damages
clause
within
the
contract
then
you
would
have
a
debt
due
as
of
the
time
of
the
insolvency.
if
you
did
not
have
a
liquidated
damages
clause,
your
damages
are
going
to
be
fixed
in
some
sense
by
the
loss
of
value
to
the
government,
either
a
repurchase
or
some
other
way
of
determining
what
the
value
of
that
contract
was.
you
have
to
have
a
determination
after
a
subsequent
event,
after
the
insolvency,
so
you
have
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
money
damages
at
all.
to
distinguish
that
from
a
tax
case,
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
of
course,
but
you
know
what
the
numbers
are.
in
the
leading
case
of
this
court
which
talked
about
taxes
as
a
debt
due,
the
court
was
very
careful
to
use
the
language
that
taxes
were
a
sum
certain
or
a
sum
that
could
be
reasonably
and
quickly
ascertained.
and
i
think
by
that
sort
of
mathematical
calculation
type
thing,
it
was
bringing,
it
was
being
careful
not
to
get
away
from
whatever
the
common
law
concept
of
debt
was
for
the
statute.
that
case
is
price
versus
united
states,
which
was
cited
by
both
counsels.
i
would
like
to,
there
is
been
some
questioning
of
the
court
and
i
understand
the
problem
of
the
difference
between
a
contingent
event
and
a
mere
disputed
event.
now,
i
want
to
say,
and
the
government
has
raised
a
point
in
their
reply
brief,
and
i
say
that
in
the
event,
say
taxes,
are
disputed
at
the
time
of
the
insolvency,
but
they
are
not
necessarily
contingent
because
you
are
not
looking
to
subsequent
events.
i
think
the
second
factor
that
is
of
importance
in
this
case
is
the
concept
of
the
fairness
to
all
the
creditors
and
i
raise
a
question
again,
why
in
this
situation
should
the
government
be
given
particular
special
treatment
because
they
were
in
a
business
relationship
with
emsco.
if
you
take
the
situation
that
emsco
had
never
bid
on
this
contract,
then
the
contracts
would
have
been
re-let
or
they
would
have
been
let
to
other
parties
at
a
higher
price
perhaps,
but
it
would
have
been
the
same
price
that
the
government
are
not
paying
anyway
rather
than
coming
in
to
this.
mr.
thomas
osa
harris
in
the
instant
case
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
at
least
there
in
respect
to
the
navy’s
contract,
the
contract
was
re-let
to
the
second
bid.
the
second
lowest
bidder
at
there
being
priced,
it
is
on
the
page
44
of
the
appendix,
i
believe.
but
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
whatever
the
second
bid
would
have
been
at
that
time
if
emsco
had
not
bid,
the
government
would
have
been
paying
a
higher
price
if
they
eventually,
they
would
up
paying
a
higher
price
anyway,
but
the
fact
that
emsco
bid
on
the
case
and
eventually
went
insolvent
works
in
this
case
to
the
government's
advantage
because
they
are
getting
a
lien
on
all
the
assets
that
emsco
had
at
the
time.
it
was
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
if
the
priority
is
extended
to
the
federal
government,
the
other
creditors
get
nothing
and
that
is
of
course
the
large
part
that
we
think
it
is
--
at
least
you
can
say
it
is
harsh
on
the
other
creditors,
perhaps
not
unfair
but
harsh.
ms.
shapiro
has
indicated
that
the
government
gets
nothing
if
the
priority
statute
is
interpreted
in
such
a
way
that
un-liquidated
claims
are
not
debts
due.
and
i
think
she’s
probably
wrong
on
that
because
under
the
texas
law
of
the
assignment
to
the
benefit
of
creditors,
the
assignee
is
compelled
to
recognize
creditors,
even
late
filing
creditors,
if
they
just
notify
the
assignee
of
their
claim
and
elect
to
be
treated
as
a
participating
creditors.
we
have
always
in
this
situation
treated
the
government
as
a
claimant,
another
creditor
and
i
never
really
even
thought
that
if
priority
did
not
extend,
that
the
government
would
not
receive
its
prorated
share
of
the
indemnities
we
have
briefed
the
case
all
along
in
that
vein.
the
question
of
the
practical
aspect
of
the
manipulation
by
the
creditor
of
the
government
by
somehow
running
into
bankruptcy
or
running
into
an
assignment
for
creditors
soon
after
the
contractual
default
and
other
in
order
to
curry
favor
with
the
remaining
creditors
is
a
specter
that
i
suppose
is
possible.
but
i
think
that
you
need
to
balance
that
horrible
example
or
that
horrible
imaginable
against
the
situation
of
the
present
harshness
on
the
credit
of
creditors.
as
i
indicated
there
are
two
factors
that
i
think
are
favorable
to
the
government
in
this
case
and
those
are
the
cases
that
indicate
that
this
case,
this
statute
is
supposed
to
be
construed
liberally
to
protect
the
government's
purse
and
my
only
response
to
that
is,
is
what
limits
are
involved
in
this.
if
you
look
to
the
state
bank
case,
united
states
versus
state
bank
of
north
carolina,
justice
story
said,
“well,
this
language
in
here
has
to
be
applied
reasonably.
you
have
to
give
it
a
reasonable
interpretation”
and
in
order
to
give
it
that
reasonable
interpretation
he
said,
“look
to
the
common
law
meanings.”
he
did
not
say,
“extend
it
to
all
claims
or
all
obligations.”
he
said,
“look
to
the
common
law
meanings”
and
we
were
talking
about
a
present
debt.
other
factors
that
militate
for
our
decision
for
the
government
would
be
the
cases
in
which
priority
has
been
assumed
even
though
there
has
been
no
real
confrontation
of
the
issue.
there
are
a
number
of
those
cases.
this
is
--
to
follow
that
approach
would
be
sort
of
law
by
accident,
you
know,
because
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
real,
there
was
no
clear
argument
of
the
question.
in
closing,
let
me
say
that
i
believe
this
is
a
narrowly
drawn
statute.
the
statute
did
not,
in
its
terms
apply
to
torts,
did
not
apply
to
obligations,
did
not
apply
to
claims.
it
was
drawn
in
terms
of
debt
and
as
the
term
was
used,
i
believe
that
the
common
law
would
indicate
it
did
not
comprehend
un-liquidated
claims.
