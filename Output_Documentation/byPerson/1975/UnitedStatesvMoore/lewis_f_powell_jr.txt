was
not
one
of
these
claims
contingent
as
well
as
un-liquidated,
contingent
in
the
sense
that
it
was
complicated
--
there
was
a
controversy
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
claim,
a
valid
claim?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

your
position
makes
no
distinction
between
claims
that
are
contingent
and
those
that
are
merely
un-liquidated,
does
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
long
as
the
government
makes
the
claim
because
if
the
claim
is
contested
at
the
time
of
the
assignment
the
obligation
would
not
be
necessarily
be
fixed
that
way?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
it
were
a
tort
claim,
contested?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
it
may
not
be
upheld,
say
for
six
to
seven
years
as
result
of
litigation,
what
happens
during
that
period
of
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
this
case
that
would
have
required
the
setting
aside
of
assets
that
would
have
deprived
other
creditors
of
any
recovery
at
all,
would
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
administration
problem
is
really
very
puzzling,
you
know?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
respondent,
a
licensed
physician
registered
under
the
controlled
substances
act
was
convicted
of
unlawful
dispensation
of
methadone.
this
is
an
addictive
drug
used
in
the
treatment
of
heroine
addicts.
respondent
was
found
guilty
in
the
district
court
of
violating
section
841
of
the
act.
a
provision
making
it
unlawful
for
any
person
knowingly
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance
except
as
authorized
by
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
respondent
was
exempted
from
prosecution
under
section
841
by
virtue
of
his
status
as
a
registered
physician.
that
court
concluded
that
registrant
can
be
prosecuted
only
under
other
sections
of
the
act
that
prescribed
less
severe
penalties.
we
conclude
that
conviction
under
section
841
was
duly
authorized.
that
section
reaches
any
person
and
we
find
no
justification
for
construing
the
act
as
imposing
lesser
penalties
on
registered
physicians
and
those
imposed
on
other
citizens.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
