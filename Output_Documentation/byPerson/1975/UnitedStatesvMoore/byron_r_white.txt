justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bergan,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
you
rest
on
the
provisions
of
841
which
say,
except
as
authorized,
and
then
822
(b)
has
headed
authorized
activities.
so
you
look
for
this
under
your
theory,
even
though
your
theory
you
would
look
to
what
the
scope
of
the
authorized
activity
was,
and
822
(b)
says,
to
the
extent
authorized
by
their
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let
us
--
now
it
seems
to
me
we
must
then
ask
what
did
the
--
what
did
their
registration
authorized
them
to
do,
right
under
the
plain
words
of
822
(b).
now,
you
would
not
suggest
that
their
registration
just
on
its
face
authorized
them
to
sell
methadone
without
a
prescription
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
except
as
authorized
language
at
841
does
not
held
you
at
all,
although
if
you
do
something
in
selling
methadone
that
is
not
authorized
by
your
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
authorized
him
to
dispense
methadone,
in
some
way
other
than
by
prescription?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
take
justice
--
mr.
justice
marshallâ€™s
example.
assume
he
just
--
did
he
not
just
sold
methadone
other
than
by
prescription,
now
that
was
not
authorized
by
his
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
he
can
be
prosecuted
under
841,
even
under
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
just
was
not
authorized
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
think
of
a
situation
where
--
where
he
gives
prescriptions,
but
he
just
does
not
act
like
a
doctor.
now,
i
suppose
his
registration
assumes
that
he
is
going
to
act
like
a
doctor,
he
is
authorized
as
a
physician
to
practice
medicine
and
to
dispense
methadone
connection
with
his
practice
in
medicine?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
the
government
is
contending,
i
gather,
that
he
just
acted
outside
the
scope
of
the
ordinary
conduct
of
a
physician?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
is
no
more
covered
by
the
exception
in
841,
then
would
be
selling
without
a
prescription?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
apparently
agree
that
he
could
be
breached
under
841
if
he
sold
without
a
prescription?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
let
me
ask
you.
do
you
think
that
he
was
a,
do
you
think
842
or
843
would
proscribe
the
conduct
for
which
he
was
prosecuted
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
government
is
wrong
in
saying
that
unless
he
is
liable
under
841,
he
is
not
liable
at
all
for
the
specific
conduct
that
for
which
he
was
convicted
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
spoke
much
more
broadly
than
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
--
on
your
theory
of
the
relationship
between
841
and
822,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
just
as
well
argue
that
any
violation
of
the
provisions
of
regulating
a
registrant
would
be
reachable
under
841,
anyone,
you
do
not
suggest
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
for
some
violations
that
their
registration,
they
may
not
be
prosecuted
under
841?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
using
a
prescription?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
colleague
here
suggested
that
if
he
does
not
dispense
with
the
prescription,
he
would
be
reached
under
841?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
is
a
technical
violation,
and
if
you
just
started,
if
you
just
put
up
the
sign
and
just
start
selling
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
this
is
no
worst
--
no
tougher
test
on
the
physicians
than
just
the
ordinary
law
on
any
kind
of
practice.
he
is
going
to
be
subject
to
some
kind
of
liability
unless
he
uses
--
conforms
ordinary
standards
of
medical
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
you
are
suggesting
though
in
these
other
provisions
that
if
for
no
legitimate
medical
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
provision
is
not
applicable
to
this.
it
is
applicable
to
the
bankruptcy
and
that
is
the
very
problem
of
your
case.
if
we
had
such
a
provision
here
that
in
a
manageable
situation,
but
that
provision
is
not.
you
are
really
seriously
submitting
that
that
provision
is
applicable
to
this
statute,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
nice
if
it
were,
that
is
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly
there
is
no
question
about
the
government
having
been
given
a
priority
by
statute.
it
is
given
a
priority
with
respect
to
debts
due
to
united
states
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
meaning
of,
not
only
debts,
but
debts
due,
is
not
it?
there
is
no
question
about
its
priority,
question
is
only
how
--what
it
covers?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
notice
on
page
--
footnote
on
page
17
in
your
brief,
you
say
that
if
there
is
no
priority,
the
other
creditors
will
receive
substantial
portions
of
their
debts
and
the
united
states
will
receive
nothing?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
see
that
on
page
3
of
the
--
of
your
opponent's
brief,
it
is
said
that
if
there
is
no
priority,
the
united
states
will
receive
40%?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
it
was,
do
you
still
maintain
that
the
united
states
will
get
nothing?
