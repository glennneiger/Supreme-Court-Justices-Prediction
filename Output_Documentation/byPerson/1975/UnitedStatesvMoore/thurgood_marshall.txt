justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
friedman,
was
not
all
that
agreed
to
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
one
about
the
time
he
spent
and
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
statement,
you
have
given
up
the
regulations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
see
it
in
your
brief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
have
not
abandoned
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
dr.
moore,
in
his
office,
dispensed
methadone
at
$25.00
a
shot,
could
he
be
guilty?
would
it
be
an
exception
because
he
is
authorized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
anybody
off
the
street,
he
has
got
a
big
sign
out,
“methadone
for
sale”
cheap
drug
dispensed
it
within
his
neighborhood,
dr.
moore.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
congress
deliberately
set
that
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
set
that
up
that
the
doctors
are
the
only
that
can
violate
the
law
and
sell
the
drug
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
and
not
violate
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
wholesaler
can
sell
a
million
dollars
worth
of
methadone
to
the
mafia
and
that
he
cannot
be
convicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
only
--
well,
he
sells
a
quarter
of
a
million
which
is
what
this
case
is
about,
you
mean,
he
could
not
be
touched?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
just
takes
his
quarter
of
a
million
and
goes
to
europe
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bergan,
he
did
more
than
that.
he
did
more
than
just
not
keep
records?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
if
he
had
sold
himself
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
dollars
worth
of
methadone
to
anybody
in
the
world,
in
his
office,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
statue
authorized
him
to
dispense
methadone
to
anybody
under
any
circumstances?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
my
case,
what
it
was
not
prescribed,
he
just
sold
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
assuming
that
he
just
sold
it,
you
said
it
would
be
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
people
come
in
and
he
says,
here
i
will
sell
you
$35.00
worth
of
methadone,
it
violates
the
statute,
the
same
doctor
with
the
same
registration,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
he
got
the
same
authorization
he
has
got
now,
and
the
man
comes
in
and
says
i
would
like
to
buy
some
methadone
for
35
bucks,
and
he
says
okay
here
is
$35.00
worth
of
methadone,
did
he
or
did
he
not
violate
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
have
a
good
case,
he
could
be
prosecuted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
man
comes
in
and
says
i
want
$35.00
worth
of
methadone,
he
says
i
cannot
give
you
the
methadone,
but
he
had
the
prescription,
that
is
it
and
he
could,
he
cannot
be
prosecuted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doctors
have
different
authorizations?
they
all
have
the
exact
same
authorization.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
medical
doctor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
practices
as
a
physician,
you
mean
each
physician
has
a
different
authorization?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
dr.
moore
had?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
a
little
difference
in
massachusetts
case.
there
were
these
people
disputing
liability,
were
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
massachusetts
case
they
were
disputing
the
liability?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
there
is
no
dispute
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
not
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
one
judge
on
the
fifth
circuit
followed
that
theory?
