justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bergan,
i
gather
there
are
four
other
circuits
who
reached
the
opposite
conclusion,
did
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
six,
well,
i
know
first,
fifth,
tenth
and
ninth
so
the
two
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
leaves
the
district
columbia
circuit
standing
alone
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
question
that
you
see
it
is,
the
one
you
just,
before
i
asked
my
question,
whether
or
not
the
prescription
limits
a
registered
physician
to
whatever
may
be
the
penalties
for
violation
of
this
legislation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bergan
even
though
i
was
thinking,
that
certainly
is
--
was
a
subject
of
congressional
concern
so
also,
was
it
not
a
concern
that
among
the
worst
abusers
in
the
drug
traffic
field
were
physicians.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
to
do
it
i
suppose,
congress
must
have
thought
consistently
with
the
authorization
they
had
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
the
government
suggests
how
prosecutors
ought
to
know
what
registrants
may
be
prosecuted
under
841
and
what
registrants
may
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
position
here
is
that
this
one
is
so
beyond
the
pale
of
the
registration
that
the
clearly
he
may
be
prosecuted
under
841.
well,
there
must
be
any
number
of
cases
of
registrants
whose
conduct
may
not
go
this
far,
well
how
is
the
line
to
be
drawn?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
was
completely
blatant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
you
do
not
suggest
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
representing
that
government
does
not
suggest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
my
question
is
whether
for
some
violation
registrants
nevertheless
may
not
be
prosecuted
under
841?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
technical
and
formal
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
another
criteria
--
