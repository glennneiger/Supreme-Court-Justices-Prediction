did
he
fill
the
prescriptions
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
his
escalating
rate
for
the
difference
in
numbers
in
the
prescription
could
not
be
attributed
to
the
filling
of
the
prescription
by
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
galileo
went
to
jail,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
did,
you
know,
why
should
not
this
guy
go
to
jail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bergan.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
get
to
the
legislative
history,
how
do
you,
in
the
statute
itself,
discern
this
division
into
two
universes
as
you
are
speaking?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
401
in
us
code?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
this
title?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
not
401
(a)
except
as
authorized,
by
this
title
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
and
then
proscribes
a
series
of
acts,
does
not
that
suggest
that
the
exception
is
in
terms
of
acts,
or
conduct,
rather
than
in
terms
of
persons?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
subsection-2
of
841,
where
it
is
made
unlawful
to
create,
distribute
or
dispense
or
posses
with
intent
to
distribute
or
dispense
a
counterfeit
substance.
your
position
that
doctors
are
authorized
to
distribute
counterfeit
substances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
could
not
be
prosecuted,
a
doctor
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
841
(2)
under
your
theory,
even
though
he
dispenses
a
counterfeit
substance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
it
is
conduct
that
you
are
talking
about,
it
is
authorization
of
conduct,
not
just
the
fact
that
the
guy
has
an
md
license?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bergan,
you
are
not
seeking
to
uphold
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
there,
are
you,
your
argument
does
not
track
that
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
said
that
if
you
are
a
registrant,
you
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
841
and
you
are
saying
that
if
you
are
a
registrant,
you
might
be
prosecuted
under
841
if
you
exceed
the
authority
conferred
by
your
registration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
government
have
improved
its
position
in
that
regard
by
filing
a
petition
for
bankruptcy
upon
the
occurrence
of
the
assignment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
cannot,
(voice
overlap)
it
can
join
as
one
of
the
three
or
whatever?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
takes
12?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
exclude
all
contractual
type
claims
supposing
that
there
is
a
promise
to
deliver
the
government
a
thousand
bricks
and
that
promise
is
breached,
so
that
you
have
a
clear
breach.
the
only
question
is
assessing
damages.
now,
i
suppose
you,
the
government
could
go
about
proving
damages
by
simply
producing
testimony
as
to
what
to
those
bricks
would
have
been
worth
without
necessarily
letting
a
contract
for
new
bricks
and
that
by
your
test
might
simply
focus
on
the
events
that
have
occurred
prior
to
the
breach,
would
that
then
be
a
debt
due?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
subsequent
event?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say,
even
though
the
testimony
of
the
proof
talked
about
events
that
had
occurred
prior
to
the
breach,
the
mere
fact
that
the
proceeding
took
place
after
the
breach
is
enough
to
take
it
out
of
the
debt
classification?
