mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
assistant
solicitor
general’s
essentially
accurate
if
somewhat
lured
account
of
the
record,
which
was
conceded
by
the
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
it
is
conceded
in
this
court,
cannot
be
permitted
to
deter
us
from
the
very
narrow
scope
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
i
would
like
to
focus
on
just
what
that
narrow
scope
was
for
a
moment
and
the
reason
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
its
decision.
at
the
very
first
page
of
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
court
below,
chief
judge
bazelon
writing
for
the
majority
of
that
court,
after
noting
that
they
found
section
841
inapplicable
to
the
appellant,
dr.
moore,
and
reversed
his
conviction,
wrote
as
follows.
“our
conclusion
is
reached
by
forced
of
the
established
principle
that
when
a
choice
has
to
be
made
between
two
readings
of
what
conduct
congress
has
made
a
crime,
it
is
appropriate
before
we
choose
the
harsher
alternative
to
require
that
congress
should
have
spoken
in
language
that
is
clear
and
definite,
citing
universal
cit
and
united
states
versus
brown
cases
from
this
court
couple
of
decades
ago.”
the
court
then
went
on
to
hold
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
am
suggesting
that
the
statute
itself
is
not
only
susceptible
of
and
permits
of
the
interpretation
of
the
court
below,
but
i
suggest
requires
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
particular
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
am
having
difficulty
with
your
word,
he,
you
mean
judge
bazelon
or
dr.
moore?
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
first
of
all
let
me
preface
by
saying
that
i
think
no
one,
either
the
counsel
who
represented
dr.
moore
in
the
trial
court
or
those
of
us
who
represented
upon
appeal,
are
going
to
seek
to
justify
what
dr.
moore
did.
the
question
is,
what
is
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
dr.
moore
was
not
misled
by
the
statute.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
dr.
moore
was
misled
by
the
statute.
what
i
am
suggesting
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
statute,
particularly
section
841
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
subchapter,
does
not
proscribe
the
conduct
of
which
dr.
moore
was
adjudged
guilty
as
criminal
under
section
841.
now,
it
may
proscribe
it
under
section
842
or
possibly
under
section
843,
but
it
does
not
proscribe
it
under
section
841
and
that
is
the
narrow
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
the
number
is
six
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
has
recently
so
held
and
i
am
unclear
about
the
sixth,
but
i
believe
that
is
the
other
one,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
stands
alone
with
a
dissenting
opinion
from
judge
eli
in
the
ninth
circuit
recently
in
the
rosenberg
case,
which
was
decided,
well,
probably
about
the
time
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
that
is
the
precise
issue.
what
the
section
841
--
section
841
(a)
of
the
statute
mean
when
it
says,
“except
as
provided
by
this
subchapter,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person,
and
then
we
skip
down
to
subsection
(1),
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance.”
in
a
situation
in
which
we
have
a
licensed
physician
in
the
district
of
columbia,
who
is
registered
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs,
to
prescribe
controlled
substances,
in
this
instance
schedule
ii
narcotic,
dolophine,
or
methadone
as
it
is
commonly
called.
judge
bazelon
wrote
in
the
court
below
and
we
believe
it
to
be
the
correct
analysis
of
what
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
looks
toward
or
leads
to,
that
congress
in
passing
the
controlled
substances
act,
aware
of
the
prettyman
commission
and
the
katzenbach
commission
reports,
aware
of
the
difficulties
suggested
by
some
of
the
cases
which
this
court
had
in
the
1920s
and
1930s
under
the
harrison
act,
the
problems
of
physicians
in
allowing
a
lay
prosecutor
and
a
jury
of
laymen
to
determine
what
was
in
effect
criminal
or
civil
or
proper
medical
practice
divided
the
drug
universe,
if
one
may
use
that
expression,
into
two
sub-universes
if
you
wish,
those
registered
to
deal
in
drugs
and
those
not
so
registered.
and
indeed
the
house
committee
report
precisely
says
that,
and
this
is
quoted
at
an
early
page
of
our
brief
in
this
court,
it
is
quoted
at
page
9;
the
bill,
and
that
describes
the
bill
which
became
the
controlled
substances
act,
the
bill
provides
for
control
by
the
justice
department
of
problems
related
to
drug
abuse
through
registration
of
manufacturers,
wholesalers,
retailers
and
all
others
in
the
legitimate
distribution
chain
as
doctors,
pharmacists,
those
authorized
to
deal
in
narcotics.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
primarily,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
language
of
section
841
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
mr.
justice
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
know,
my
friend
says
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
but
i
am
using
the
references
in
the
--
that
were
used
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
ones
that
we
have
used
in
the
brief.
the
language
of
section
841,
the
“except
as
authorized”
language,
suggests
it
seems
to
us
that
when
you
read
that
subchapter,
one
has
to
read
“except
as
authorized”
by
this
subchapter
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
right,
by
this
title.
in
the
original
it
was
subchapter,
but
as
it
was
codified
it
becomes
that
title.
you
find
in
that
title
in
section
822
(b)
a
provision
for
registration.
dr.
moore
was
of
course
concededly
registered
with
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
as
the
agency
was
called
at
that
time,
at
all
times
through
the
course
of
the
conduct,
for
which
he
was
prosecuted,
convicted
and
sentenced.
section
822
(b)
provides
that
persons
registered
by
the
attorney
general
to
dispense
controlled
substances,
and
i
may
alluding
a
few
words
in
this
quote,
are
authorized
to
dispense
such
substances
to
the
extent
so
authorized,
i
believe
that
is
the
precise
language
of
section
822
(b).
now,
he
was
authorized,
other
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
not
for
the
reason
that
those
acts
and
i
take
it
you
are
referring
to
the
provisions
of
subdivision-1
and
subdivision-2,
manufacture,
distribute,
dispense
that
particular
language,
those
are
the
acts
which
are
covered
by
the
classes
of
persons
who
are
permitted
to
register
to
do
those
acts
under
the
preceding
sections
of
the
statute.
for
example,
section
822,
picks
up
almost
the
same
language,
section
822
(a)
refers
to
annual
registration.
every
person
who
manufactures,
distributes,
or
dispenses
any
controlled
substance
or
who
proposes
to
engage
in
the
manufacturing,
distribution
or
dispensing
of
any
controlled
substance
shall
annually
obtain
a
registration
issued
by
the
attorney
general
in
accordance
with
the
rules
promulgated.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
there
is
no
provision
that
i
know
of
in
the
statute
that
would
authorize
the
registration
of
physicians
or
anyone
else,
pharmacists
or
manufacturers,
or
whatever
to
create,
distribute,
or
dispense
counterfeit
substances.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
i
suggest
that
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
perhaps
i
have
not
made
my
theory
clear,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
a
doctor
could
not,
under
my
theory,
under
our
theory
and
as
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
below
held,
a
doctor
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
841
(a)
(2),
which
i
believe
is
the
counterfeit
substance
situation,
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
that
for
creating,
distributing,
or
dispensing
a
counterfeit
substance
if
he
was
authorized
by
another
section
of
this
title
so
to
do,
but
he
could
not
so
be
authorized.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
it
is
not
the
fact
that
he
has
an
md
license.
it
is
the
fact
that
he
is
authorized
by
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
to
dispense
certain
narcotics,
as
he
was
in
this
case
authorized
to
dispense
dolophine
or
all
schedule
ii
narcotics
for
off
the
record
shows,
i
am
not
sure
that
it
shows
it
one
way
or
the
other.
the
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
suggest
that
if
the
statute
said
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
there
would
be
no
ambiguity
and
the
answer
to
your
suggestion
is
yes,
it
would
be
more
helpful
to
me
if
i
said
that.
i
wish
that
it
said
that.
it
does
not
unfortunately,
but
i
believe
that
the
manner
in
which
the
statute
is
written
creates
an
ambiguity,
which
requires
the
kind
of
liberalized,
if
that
is
the
correct
word,
construction
placed
on
it
by
judge
bazelon,
for
the
reason
that
the
earlier
cases
from
this
court
so
hold
that
before
one
can
say
that
the
congress
intended
the
more
severe
of
two
or
more
possible
alternatives
to
result,
they
should
have
spoken
so
--
spoken
to
that
with
more
clarity
than
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
am
sorry
now,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
he
has
got
a
bndd
registration?
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
as
long
as
that
bndd
is
in
effect,
the
answer
is
to
revoke
that
registration
and
then
prosecute
him
if
he
keeps
doing
it
because
that
is
the
dichotomy,
which
i
suggest
that
the
congress
set
up.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
believe
that
congress
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
no,
it
would
apply
to
wholesalers,
manufacturers,
pharmacists,
all
others
who
are
authorized
or
who
can
be
authorized
by
bureau
of
narcotic
and
dangerous
drug
registration
to
deal
in
narcotics.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no
i
--
you
put
a
case,
mr.
justice
marshal,
that
i
have
never
focused
on,
i
would
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
can
answer
that
question.
i
am
not
at
all
certain
that
he
could
be
touched
under
841
as
long
as
he
had
authorization.
that
authorization
can
be
revoked.
it
could
be
revoked
at
the
time.
the
means
of
revocation
are
now
more
easily
set
forth
in
the
new
narcotic
addicts
--
narcotic
addict
treatment
act,
it
is
an
annual
registration.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
he
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
obviously
it
is
not
a
willy-nilly
authorization
to
do
everything.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
but
my
registration,
or
dr.
moore’s
registration
in
this
case,
authorized
him
to
dispense
methadone,
that
was
the
limitation
of
it,
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
oh!
no,
by
prescription,
well
i
suppose
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
assuming
his
registration
was
limited
to
by
prescription
that
would
not
be
authorized.
he
would
be
outside
the
authorized
chain.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
because
he
was
not
authorized
to
do
what
he
then
did.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
well,
if
that
is
the
situation,
yes,
to
the
extent
so
authorized.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
one
must
be
a
physician
to
be
--
to
have
the
type
of
authorization,
which
dr.
moore
had.
i
would
assume
that
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
think
that
is
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
government’s
contention.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
well,
i
believe
that
is
what
their
case
comes
down
to,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
yes,
on
the
assumption
that
his
--
that
his,
let
us
take
an
easy
example,
if
he
went
to
the
playground
at
central
high
school
and
sold
methadone
then
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be,
yes.
the
extent
of
his
registration
was
to
prescribe
and
dispense
with
controlled
substances
in
that
way
and
he
was
then
acting
outside
the
scope
of
his
registration
and
he
does
not
fall
within
the
except
as
otherwise
authorized
language
of
section
841.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
suppose
we
can
assume
that
together,
i
would
take
that
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
think
not
at
all.
i
think
the
case
you
have
put,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
a
classic
manslaughter
situation.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
think
it
differs
markedly,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
let
me
say
to
you
that
as
we
have
developed
in
the
brief,
and
as
was
developed
at
some
minor
extent
by
the
opinion
in
the
court
below,
not
to
any
great
extent
because
it
was
not
necessary
to
reach
that
point,
this
kind
of
a
situation,
the
kind
of
a
situation
with
which
we
are
dealing
here,
section
841
of
the
controlled
substances
act,
ought
not
to
depend
upon
conflicting
medical
opinions
as
to
what
is
or
what
is
not
valid.
a
fellow
ought
not
to
be,
and
i
suggest
that
the
statute
does
not
permit
a
fellow
to
be
prosecuted,
convicted,
sentenced
to
a
long
period
of
incarceration,
in
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
it
was
45
years,
because
of
conduct
which
is
subject
to
conflicting
views
among
physicians.
now,
we
are
dealing
in
an
area
and
that
congress
has
been
wrestling
with
this
area
for
several
decades,
and
that
is
the
area
of
narcotics.
the
schedule
i
narcotic
for
example,
no
one
would
dispute
that
is
heroin
and
others
which
have
no
real
medical
value,
and
that
congress
has
in
this
statute
and
in
others
in
effect
said,
thou
shalt
not
use
it.
the
schedule
ii,
schedule
iii,
schedule
iv,
and
they
go
down
in
order
of
difficulty
to
handle
are
narcotics
as
to
which
all
persons
would
perhaps
say,
as
to
some,
that
there
is
some
legitimate
medical
value.
perhaps
fewer
persons
would
say
as
to
some
of
them
that
there
is
greater
or
less
legitimate
medical
value.
that
is
why
i
suggest,
and
this
is
laid
out
at
some
length
in
the
prettyman
report,
it
has
troubled
this
court
from
time-to-time
over
the
last
35
or
40
years
beginning
with
a
case,
which
i
regret
that
i
can
never
pronounce,
jin
fuey
moy,
i
think
is
the
case
and
leading
up
to
linder,
perhaps
even
more
recently,
it
is
laid
out
in
the
prettyman
report
and
the
katzenbach
report,
and
that
is
why
i
suggest
that
in
this
particular
statute
as
the
congress
itself
said,
as
the
house
report
itself
says,
the
world
of
the
drug
universe
is
divided
into
those
registered
to
do
certain
things,
and
those
who
are
not
registered
to
do
certain
things.
we
deal
more
harshly
with
the
ones
who
are
not
registered
to
do
these
things
because
they
are
outside
the
chain
where
we
can
keep
an
eye
on
them
and
see
what
they
do,
and
to
revoke
their
registration
or
refuse
to
re-register,
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
yes,
yes.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
that
section
goes
on
to
say,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
except
as
authorized
by
this
subchapter
or
by
this
title
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
indicated
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
there
was
that
concern.
it
was
expressed
by
the
congress
in
the
passage
of
this
very
act
and
having
so
been
expressed
that
congress
then
went
on,
i
suggest
mr.
justice
brennan,
to
divide
the
world
of
those
who
deal
with
drugs
and
to
those
who
do
so
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
or
now
the
drug
enforcement
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
and
the
authorization,
if
your
honor
please
in
this
instance,
was
to
dispense
by
means
of
prescription
a
schedule
ii
narcotic.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
i
do
not
find
any
significance
in
the
title.
it
has
been
a
long
time
mr.
chief
justice,
since
i
dealt
with
codified
statutes.
but
i
--
those
titles
are
normally
put
in
by
the
codifier
and
it
is
clear
that
it
does
in
fact
deal
with,
when
we
come
directly
to
the
question
which
i
think
you
are
asking,
it
does
deal
with
prohibited
acts.
it
does
deal
with
prohibited
acts
and
if
this
man
was
operating
beyond
his
registration,
as
for
example
going
across
to
the
front
steps
of
the
capitol,
and
handing
out
heroin,
the
fact
that
he
was
registered
with
the
bureau
of
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
to
do
something
else,
the
fact
that
he
was
a
physician
would
not
immunize
him
from
prosecution.
in
this
case,
however,
because
he
was
registered
to
do
what
he
did,
the
remedy
was
two-fold,
together
or
one
at
a
time.
de-registration
or
refusal
to
register
on
an
annual
basis
when
he
came
for
re-registration
and
or
prosecution
under
842
or
843
of
the
statute
for
the
various
things,
which
registrants
are
precluded
from
doing.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
yes,
i
think
it
could
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
well
i
am
not
terribly
sure
that
the
government
is
taking
that
position.
maybe
that
--
i
am
not
just
sure
that
that
is
the
position
they
are
taking.
for
example
though,
section
842
makes
it
criminal
to
fail
to
keep
records,
and
defines
the
types
of
records
which
were
required
to
be
kept,
the
evidence
in
the
court
below
is
certainly
susceptible
of
the
--
of
a
finding
if
a
section
842
charge
had
been
made
and
submitted
to
the
jury,
that
adequate
records
were
not
kept.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
quite
agree,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
he
did
not
do
more
which
the
congress
said
he
could
be
prosecuted
for.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
if
that
is
what
he
was
--
if
that
is
what
he
was
authorized
by
bndd
to
do,
mr.
justice
marshall,
then
i
would
answer
that
question
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
841
(a).
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
his
registration
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
pursuant
to
section
822
(b)
of
the
statute,
authorized
him
to
dispense
or
prescribe
methadone
without
limitation.
now
that
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
he
prescribed
methadone.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
well,
i
am
sorry,
i
have
misinterpreted
your
question
then,
if
your
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
if
he
sold
it
without
the
prescription,
and
if
his
authorization
was
to
prescribe
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
that
is
a
different
case
than
we
have,
mr.
justice
marshal,
but
the
answer
to
your
question
i
think
very
candidly
is
yes,
the
government
would
have
a
better
case
of
prosecuting
that
particular
person
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
the
government
would
have
a
better
case
of
prosecuting
him
under
section
841,
it
would
depend
sir
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
one
would
have
to
examine
the
particular
facts
of
that
case,
but
as
you
put
the
case,
if
he
is
authorized
by
bndd
so
to
do,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
841.
now,
it
would
depend,
sir,
it
would
depend
upon
the
precise
limits
of
his
authorization,
but
in
this
case
the
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
do
not
know
whether
--
the
answer
is
yes,
some
of
them
do
differ.
for
example,
there
are
clinical
investigative
authorizations
which
require
that
the
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
i
am
talking
of
a
medical
doctor,
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
no,
i
do
not
mean
that
each
has
a
different
authorization,
but
there
are
differing
types
of
authorizations.
for
example,
physicians
may
be
authorized
to
conduct
clinical
programs
in
their
office,
and
that
authorization
even
back
at
the
time
here
in
question
frequently
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
my
answer
to
your
question
is
the
same,
sir,
that
the
question
that
you
posed,
that
doctor
who
sold
did
not
prescribe
could
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
841.
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
it
does
not
track
it
directly,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
parallels
it,
but
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
if
you
act
outside
your
registration.
i
am
not
really
sure
we
are
saying
anything
differently,
but
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
if
you
act
beyond
your
--
mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
well
they
painted
it
with
a
very
broad
brush,
i
certainly
have
to
concede
that
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you.
