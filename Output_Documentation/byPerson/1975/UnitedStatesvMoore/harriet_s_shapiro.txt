ms.

s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
it
involves
the
interpretation
of
31
u.s.c.
191
which
provides
that
when
a
person
indebted
to
the
united
states
becomes
insolvent,
the
debts
due
to
the
united
states
shall
be
paid
first.
the
issue
here
is
whether
that
priority
of
the
united
states,
applies
only
when
the
precise
amount
of
the
debt
is
established
before
insolvency
or
whether
all
debts
due
to
the
united
states
since
insolvency,
whether
liquidated
or
not,
are
to
be
paid
first.
the
fact
here
were
stipulated.
emsco
which
is
a
texas
corporation
breached
three
contracts
with
the
defense
department.
after
they
had
breached
the
contracts,
it
assigned
all
its
property
to
respondent
to
be
sold
for
the
benefit
of
its
creditors
and
that
act
of
course
established
its
insolvency.
shortly
thereafter,
the
government
re-let
those
contracts
that
emsco
had
breached
and
the
amount
of
emsco’s
debt
to
the
government
was
determined.
it
was
determined
by
settlement
of
two
of
the
contracts
and
by
charging
emsco
for
the
excess
costs
of
re-procurement
on
the
other.
the
priority
statute
requires
that
when
a
person
indebted
to
the
government
becomes
insolvent,
the
debts
to
the
united
states
shall
be
paid
first.
and
a
voluntary
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
is
the
one
of
the
ways
in
which
insolvency
can
be
shown
under
the
statute.
it
is
--
that
is
also
an
act
of
bankruptcy.
so
that
when
there
is
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors,
the
creditors
have
a
choice.
they
can
either
consent
to
the
assignment
and
take
their
share
of
the
debtor's
estate
under
the
conditions
in
the
assignment
or
if
they
prefer
the
protection
of
bankruptcy
laws,
they
can
petition
to
have
the
debtor
declared
a
bankrupt,
in
which
case
the
assignment
is
void.
if
there
had
been
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
here,
it
is
clear
that
the
government's
claims
on
this
contract
would
have
been
debts
provable
in
bankruptcy
because
the
bankruptcy
act
expressly
defines
debts
to
include
un-liquidated
or
even
contingent
claims.
these
are
provable
debts
and
so
long
as
they
are
liquidated
or
can
be
estimated
soon
enough,
so
that
they
can
paid
without
unduly
delaying
the
administration
of
the
estate,
they
are
allowable.
in
addition,
the
bankruptcy
act
gives
a
priority
to
debts
owing
to
any
person,
including
the
united
states
entitled
to
a
priority
under
federal
law,
so
that
the
bankruptcy
act
incorporates
the
priority
statute
by
reference.
a
number
of
cases,
both
in
this
court
and
in
the
courts
of
appeals
have
assumed
that
this
priority
applies
to
claims
like
the
ones
here
which
were
un-liquidated
when
insolvency
occurred.
so
that
if
there
had
been
a
bankruptcy,
we
submit
that
these
claims
would
not
only
have
been
provable,
but
would
been
entitled
to
a
priority.
but
there
was
not
any
petition
in
bankruptcy
here.
the
government
simply
asserted
its
claims
to
priority
under
the
priority
statute.
when
the
claim
was
denied,
the
government
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
following
the
established
principle,
found
that
the
government
was
indeed
entitled
to
its
priority,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
interpreted,
it
is
a
175
year
old
statute
without
considering
any
of
the
previous
cases
which
it
had
construed,
the
policy
it
was
designed
to
serve
or
even
the
long-standing
practice
under
it.
the
court
held
that
before
its
debts
due
means
only
those
debts
which
would
have
been
entitled
to
be
recovered
under
common
law
action
of
debt.
since
the
claims
here
were
not
for
fixed
and
certain
amounts
presently
payable
at
insolvency,
they
were
not
debts
due
at
common
law,
and
therefore,
the
court
held
they
were
not
entitled
to
priority.
we
submit
that
that
decision
is
simply
wrong,
both
on
the
basis
of
precedent
and
because
it
was
undesirable,
practical
effects.
the
precedents
are
entirely
clear
in
holding
that
the
priority
statute
applies
not
only
to
debts
which
are
due
in
the
sense
of
being
presently
payable,
when
at
the
moment
that
insolvency
occurs,
but
it
also
applies
to
debts
where
the
obligation
has
accrued,
but
the
time
for
payment
has
not
yet
arrived.
in
fact
the
respondent
does
not
really
dispute
this,
but
we
submit
that
that
fact
alone
should
demonstrate
the
common
law
action
for
debt
which
requires
that
the
debt
be
presently
payable
is
not
an
appropriate
standard
for
defining
debts
due.
indeed
if
the
standard
were
strictly
applied,
there
could
be
some
question
about
whether
taxes
would
be
within
the
priority
at
all.
since
there
are
some
precedent
indicating
that
taxes
are
not
common
law
debts.
and
of
course
the
status
of
taxes
which
have
accrued,
but
which
are
not
payable
at
the
precise
point
of
the
insolvency
would
still
more
uncertain.
there
is
not
any
such
uncertainty
now.
priority
statute
clearly
applies
to
all
accrued
taxes,
including
un-liquidated
ones
and
to
those
which
have
accrued
but
are
not
yet
due,
when
the
insolvency
occurs.
the
priority
statute
also
has
long
been
assumed
to
apply
to
contract
debts
of
the
sort
involved
here
where
the
obligation
has
been
established
by
the
time
that
the
insolvency
occurs,
but
the
precise
amount
of
the
obligation
is
not
settled
until
later.
the
effect
on
government
revenues
of
altering
this
long-standing
interpretation
of
the
priority
statute
is
hard
to
estimate.
indeed
for
the
tax
applications,
we
really
have
not
been
able
to
get
any
estimate
because
the
effect
of
the
decision
is
so
unclear.
what
it
does
is
create
questions,
but
there
is
really
no
way
of
telling
what
the
precise
impact
of
it
would
be.
on
the
contract
applications,
the
defense
department
has
estimated
that
in
a
typical
year,
perhaps
some
$20
million
in
government
claims
in
defense
contracts
alone
might
be
affected.
there
is
a
further
reason
why
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed,
in
addition
to
its
precedent
and
its
effect
on
government
revenues.
it
provides
a
practically
unworkable
standard
for
the
person
who
must
distribute
the
insolvent's
estate.
he
must
decide
whether
a
given
government
claim
is
entitled
to
priority
and
if
he
guesses
wrong,
he
may
be
personally
liable
to
the
government
for
the
amount
paid
to
the
other
creditors.
it
is
therefore
very
important
to
have
clear
standards
for
determining
when
the
priority
applies
and
the
limitations
of
the
common
law
action
for
debt
are
certainly
not
the
kind
of
clear
standards
that
are
appropriate.
the
respondent
seems
to
agree
that
the
decision
below
cannot
really
mean
exactly
what
it
says.
he
suggests
that
nevertheless,
this
court
should
limit
the
debts
to
which
the
priority
statute
applies
to
ones
which
have
been
liquidated
before
the
insolvency
occurs.
but
that
limitation
too
is
unsupported
by
precedent
and
it
is
also
unrelated
to
the
purpose
of
the
priority
statute.
the
courts
have
consistently
interpreted
the
statute
as
applying
to
all
types
of
debts.
they
have
recognized
that
its
broad
purpose
is
to
protect
the
federal
revenues
and
when
a
particular
debt
is
liquidated,
is
not
significant
in
terms
of
that
policy.
the
government's
interest
in
assuring
that
the
debts
owed
to
it
will
be
paid
is
not
related
to
the
time
of
the
precise
amount
of
the
debt
is
determined.
but
there
is
an
appropriate
source
of
guidance
for
determining
the
meaning
of
the
debts
in
the
priority
statute.
that
source
is
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
uses
the
precise
term
and
as
used
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
term
“debts”
explicitly
includes
un-liquidated
and
contingent
claims.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
right.
the
current
bankruptcy
act
did.
there
was
an
earlier
bankruptcy
act
about
1800
which
also
recognized
certain
contingent
claims
as
debts.
and
the
priority
statute
refers
in
effect
to
the
bankruptcy
act
since
one
of
the
types
of
in
--
one
the
acts
which
makes
it
applicable
or
any
is
any
kind
of
bankruptcy.
and
moreover
the
bankruptcy
act
refers
to
the
priority
act
in
defining
debts
which
are
entitled
to
priority.
so
there
is
a
distinct
cross
reference.
both
acts
deal
with
insolvency
and
protect
federal
interests
by
providing
federal
priorities.
so
both
reflect
similar
policies
and
moreover
they
are
overlapping
in
the
sense
that
a
case
involving
one
statute
will
very
often
also
involve
the
other.
so
differences
in
interpretation
of
identical
languages
under
these
circumstances
almost
certainly
will
lead
to
confusion
and
such
differences
should
be
avoided
unless
they
are
clearly
required
by
the
statute's
language
or
by
it
is
purpose
and
no
such
difference
is
required
here.
un-liquidated
claims
are
debts
under
the
bankruptcy
act
and
for
that
reason
they
also
should
be
considered
debts
under
the
priority
act.
this
interpretation
of
the
act
has
an
entirely
practical
advantage,
not
only
to
the
government,
but
also
to
those
who
contract
with
it.
from
the
government’s
point
of
view,
the
priority
should
attach
when
the
contract
is
breached.
if
it
does
not,
the
debtor
can
manipulate
the
time
at
which
he
becomes
insolvent
in
order
to
avoid
the
government’s
priority
and
he
may
very
often
want
to
do
that
in
order
to
prefer
creditors
with
whom
he
may
want
to
deal
later.
manipulation
is
not
--
it
would
not
be
difficult.
he
would
have
simply
have
to
make
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
or
file
an
involuntary
petition
in
bankruptcy,
promptly
after
he
has
breached
his
contract
before
the
government
has
a
chance
to
liquidate
its
damages.
but
to
try
to
protect
itself
from
having
its
priority
defeated
in
that
way,
the
government
in
its
turn
would
have
to
liquidate
its
claims
as
rapidly
as
possible
even
perhaps
by
terminating
contracts
where
it
had
doubts
about
the
contractor’s
insolvency
and
that
certainly
is
not
a
policy
that
would
benefit
contractors.
it
might
very
well
lead
to
increased
litigation
over
contract
terminations
and
it
could
increase
business
instability
by
tending
to
push
border
line
companies
in
insolvency.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
certainly
the
government
does
have
a
very
strong
interest
in
liquidating
the
claims
as
promptly
as
possible.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
perfectly
true.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
it
is
important
not
to
have
the
government’s
priority
turn
on
the
speed
with
which
it
can
liquidate
the
estate.
there
certainly
is
no
chance
that
the
government
is
going
to
delay
liquidation
if
its
priority
does
not
turn
on
that.
all
i
am
saying
is
you
should
not
have
a
rule
that
says,
“okay,
the
minute
you
think
that
there
may
be
insolvency,
you
have
to
rush
in
and
liquidate
immediately
on
pain
of
loosing
your
priority.
the
government
certainly
does
not
have
any
interest
in
delaying
liquidation
and
it
is
not
going
to
do
so,
it
certainly
did
not
do
so
here
and
in
fact
under
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
no.
in
fact
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
in
fact
i
think
that
the
respondent
would
agree
that
the
point
of
liquidation
is
when
the
contract
was
re-let
and
here
the
last
one,
well
the
first
contract
was
re-let
within
the
period
within
which
the
non-priority
creditors
could
submit
there
claims,
before
december
1,
1966.
the
second
one
was
liquidated
within
the
time
which
--
within
which
the
assignment
could
still
have
been
avoided
by
a
petition
in
bankruptcy.
and
the
final
one
was
liquidated
within,
assuming
there
had
been
a
petition
in
bankruptcy,
then
you
have
six
months
to
file
claims
and
now
that
--the
final
claim
was
liquidated
within
that
six
months
so
the
government
has
not
delayed
and
it
does
not
normally.
as
i
have
said,
all
i
am
saying
really
is
that
you
should
not
put
a
penalty
on
the
government
of
loosing
its
priority
if
it
fails
to
liquidate
before
there
is
an
assignment
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
respondent
or
emsco
did
maintain
that
and
i
believe
all
three
of
the
contracts
were
terminated
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
rather
than
breached
by
emsco.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
--
what
we
claim
is
that
this
claim
was
un-liquidated,
but
were
not
contingent.
certainly
the
fact
that
there
was
litigation
concerning
the
type
of
breach,
does
not
we
believe
make
it
--
makes
the
claim
contingent
when
the
conclusion
of
a
court
of
--
contract
appeals
board
was
that
in
fact
there
had
been
a
breach
as
of
the
time
the
breach
occurred,
that
--
the
finding
of
the
board
relates
back
to
the
moment
of
the
breach.
certainly,
so
long
as
the
obligation
of
the
debtor
is
fixed,
so
long
as
the
cause
of
action
has
accrued
by
the
time
there
is
an
assignment
or
other
act
of
insolvency,
we
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
about
what
happens
to
the
result
of
the
contest
if
in
fact
there
is
a
determination
that
the
government’s
claim
was
valid.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
don’t
believe
that
makes
any
difference
as
i
know
that
it
had
--
as
long
as
it
is
a
--
the
result
is
that
the
government’s
claim
is
upheld
then
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
other
provision
that
is
in
the
bankruptcy
act
which
we
believe
certainly
might
well
be
applicable
under
to
this
--
to
the
priority
statute
is
that
if
the
claim
cannot
be
either
liquidated
or
estimated
within
a
time
which
would
permit
the
reasonable
prompt
--
reasonably
prompt
administration
of
the
estate
then
it
is
not
a
provable
claim.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
is
no
real
reason
why
it
could
not
be
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
other
possibility
of
course
is
that
the
respondent
or
the
assignee
can
set
aside
an
amount
necessary
to
meet
the
government’s
claims.
this
is
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
that
is
true,
it
would
have.
this
is
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
court
in
united
states
v.
barnes
faced
up
to
that
and
decided
that
the
priority
statute
in
fact
applied
--
provided
that
the
government
did
have
a
priority
and
in
those
circumstances
the
government
--
there
is
a
policy
of
giving
the
government
a
priority
is
that
--
congress
has
decided
that
it
applies,
that
it
should
prevail.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
yes,
that
certainly
is
just
correct,
yes.
well,
i
am
--
and
my
conclusion
really
is
that
the
decision
permitting
private
creditors
to
get
a
larger
share
of
the
assets
of
the
insolvent's
estate
is
a
change
for
congress
to
make.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
do
not
know
how
they
got
to
the
40%.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
under
the
terms
of
the
assignment,
that
provided
for
the
payment
to
the
non-priority
creditors
who
submitted
claims
by
the
first
of
december
1966.
the
government
did
not
submit
a
claim
as
a
non-priority
creditor
by
december
1,
1966,
so
under
the
terms
of
the
assignment,
the
government
would
get
nothing.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
could
have,
but
we
thought
we
had
a
priority
on
the
basis
of
the
practice
up
to
that
point.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
government
cannot
by
itself
file
a
petition
for
bankruptcy
when
there
are
more
than
12
creditors.
it
cannot
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
takes
12.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
takes
12
if
there
are
more
than
12
creditors.
oh!
i
am
sorry,
you
are
right,
it

[laughter]
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
--
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
two
points,
sir.
the
first
--
my
first
point
is
that
the
massachusetts
case
really
was
deciding
that
a
debt
is
not
due
when
the
debtor
can
at
that
point
of
insolvency
decide
whether
he
is
going
to
pay
the
united
states
or
the
state.
that
in
that
kind
of
situation
you
have
a
contingent
debt
that
which
--
it
is
--
that
is
much
harder
to
say
it
is
a
debt
due.
tax
claims
can
be
contingent
in
the
sense
of
uncertain.
for
example,
you
can
have
an
accrual
basis
tax
payer
who
has
gone
a
mind,
the
results
of
the
--
the
profits
from
the
mind
will
not
be
determined
for
a
period
of
time
or
when
there
is
a
sum
in
litigation
or
when
there
is
a
sales
contracts
where
the
amount
payable
is
not
determined
until
the
end.
and
finally,
in
the
standard
liquidated
--
standard
contract
terms
for
damages,
the
liquidated
damage
clause
is
ordinarily
not
the
exclusive
remedy
either,
also
a
provision
for
contingent
for
consequential
damages
or
other
damages
that
result
that
it
--
the
damages
here
could
have
been
determined
at
the
moment
of
breach,
there
is
no
necessity
to
wait
for
the
re-contracting.
