mr.
paul
l.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
question
is
whether
a
physician,
and
it
also
applies
to
other
practitioners
including
pharmacist,
registered
under
the
controlled
substances
act
to
prescribe
and
dispense
drugs
for
legitimate
medical
purposes
is
immune
merely
because
he
is
so
registered
from
prosecution
under
the
section
of
the
act
which
prohibits
the
unlawful
distribution
of
controlled
substances.
the
evidence
at
trial
was
overwhelming
that
respondent
was
really
no
different
from
any
street-corner
drug
pusher
and
that
he
engaged
in
the
indiscriminant
sale
of
prescriptions
for
profit
without
really
providing
any
type
of
medical
treatment
for
his
so-called
patients.
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
someone
like
respondent
because
he
was
a
doctor
from
penalties
applicable
to
other
traffickers
in
narcotic
drugs.
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
stands
alone,
because
of
this,
the
first
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
tenth
circuit,
and
we
think
by
implication
the
sixth
circuit
had
concluded
that
congress
intended
that
doctors,
pharmacies,
hospitals,
veterinarians
and
other
practitioners,
who
after
all
had
the
greatest
access
to
drugs
and
the
greatest
opportunity
to
divert
them,
would
be
treated
the
same
as
any
other
persons
when
they
traffic
in
narcotics.
briefly,
the
facts,
are
that
respondent
was
indicted
at
first
in
639
counts,
each
involving
a
sale
of
a
prescription,
but
he
went
to
trial
on
40
counts,
38
were
presented
to
the
jury
and
they
have
convicted
in
22
counts.
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
methadone,
which
is
the
controlled
substance
involved
in
this
case,
is
a
synthetic
narcotic
drug,
it
is
a
morphine
substitute
and
it
can
be
as
physically
and
psychologically
addictive
as
heroin
can.
in
fact
because
it
is
cheaper
and
it
is
often
more
readily
available
than
heroin,
some
heroin
addicts
use
it
as
a
substitute
for
heroin
when
they
cannot
get
heroin.
but
at
the
same
time,
under
proper
supervision
and
control,
it
can
be
very
useful
in
the
treatment
of
addicts
either
through
“detoxification”
or
“maintenance.”
detoxification,
which
is
what
respondent
say
he
was
involved
in
here,
involves
giving
the
addict
a
large
of
dose
of
methadone
at
first
in
order
to
keep
him
free
from
withdrawal
symptoms
and
gradually
reducing
the
dosage
until
he
obtains
--
attains
abstinence
from
all
drugs.
maintenance
on
the
other
hand,
really
substitutes
methadone
addiction
for
heroin
addiction,
a
fixed
dosage
is
given
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
now,
respondent
had
run
a
detoxification
program
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
1969,
but
he
was
ultimately
arrested
for
violating
the
harrison
narcotics
act,
an
act
that
this
court
said
maybe
violated
by
physicians
when
they
sell
prescriptions
or
drugs
indiscriminately
and
not
for
legitimate
medical
purpose.
he
promised
at
that
time
that
an
exchange
for
the
dismissal
of
charges,
he
promised
the
grand
jury
that
he
would
change
his
ways
in
the
manner
in
which
he
conducted
his
program.
that
he
would
obtain
medical
histories
from
all
of
his
patients,
that
he
would
conduct
reasonably
thorough
physical
examinations,
that
he
would
abide
by
the
results
of
urinalysis,
which
can
show
whether
or
not
there
are
narcotics
in
the
bloodstream.
that
he
would
record
the
times
and
the
amounts
of
the
dosages
of
methadone
given
and
that
he
would
either
give
the
methadone
at
his
clinic
or
he
would
prescribe
only
so
much
as
necessary
for
daily
dosage.
at
trial
in
this
case,
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
follow
these
agreements.
in
a
five
and
one-half
month
period,
which
is
the
time
involved
in
the
indictment
here,
from
september
1,
1971
to
february
11,
1972,
it
is
true
that
respondent
was
registered
under
the
controlled
substances
act
to
conduct
the
methadone
detoxification
program.
he
did
not
give
physical
examinations
to
his
so-called
patients.
he
did
not
take
urine
samples
under
supervision.
he
ignored
the
results
of
his
urine
samples
and
he
did
not
give
the
methadone
at
his
clinic
and
he
did
not
prescribe
only
a
daily
dosage.
rather,
he
sold
prescriptions
and
he
charged
as
our
brief
indicates
and
as
the
record
clearly
shows,
depending
upon
the
amount
of
tablets
prescribed.
if
you
got
a
50-tablet
prescription
you
pay
$15.00,
if
you
got
a
75-tablet
prescription
you
would
pay
$25.00,
for
a
100-tablet
prescription
you
pay
$35.00,
you
could
come
back
as
often
as
you
wanted
to.
some
of
witnesses
testified
they
came
back
every
day
or
every
other
day,
a
few
came
back
on
occasion,
more
than
once
in
a
single
day.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
what
did
was
he
wrote
out
the
prescription
for
whatever
amounts
you
want
it
and
you
paid
for
the
prescription,
you
then
went
to
a
drug
store
and
had
the
prescription
filled
and
paid
again
for
the
druggist's
fee.
there
were
three
particular
drugstores
involved
here,
none
of
which
were
charged
with
any
criminal
offenses,
but
the
11,000
prescriptions
filled
in
this
period
were
all
filled
at
these
particular
drugstores.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
cost
of
the
particular
tablet.
it
was
the
cost
of
him
writing
a
hundred
rather
than
fifty
that
was
involved.
in
five-and-half
months,
he
sold
prescriptions
for
800,000
dolophine
tablets,
which
is
a
form
of
methadone
and
he
took
in
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
he
gave
no
treatment.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
five-and-one-half
month
period
from
september
’71
to
february
of
’72
when
he
was
closed
down.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
the
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
was
back
in
’69
when
he
promised
to
make
the
change
in
his
form
of
treatment
and
for
a
time
he
apparently
did
or
at
least
was
not
detected,
if
he
did
not
and
he
did
have
a
registration
to
engage
in
detoxification.
but
then
in
’71
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities
that
he
was
not
following
these
promises
and
through
the
use
of
undercover
agents
and
otherwise,
they
found
that
he
was
not
doing
any
of
the
things
that
he
promised
that
he
would
do
and
so
he
was
arrested,
closed
down
and
indicted
in
these
639
counts
indictment.
there
was
some
feeling
i
gather
that
back
in
’69
that
because
detoxification
could
be
useful
if
properly
run
and
supervised
and
controlled,
that
dr.
moore
should
be
given
a
chance
to
do
it
under
proper
conditions
because
he
could
make
a
contribution
to
the
community
in
helping
addicts.
but
apparently
as
the
evidence
showed
at
trial
that
was
not
his
desire
or
intention
at
all,
because
less
than
two-years
later
he
was
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
all
these
facts,
absolutely,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
i
think
it
is
important
to
put
this
in
a
proper
factual
context
and
to
show
really
how
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended,
that
people
that
engage
in
this
kind
of
a
egregious
conduct
should
be
exempt
from
felony
prosecution
for
distributing
or
selling
narcotics.
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
potential
for
abuse,
the
dangers
that
treatment
programs
have,
the
fact
that
doctors
are
the
largest
source,
doctors
and
pharmacies,
of
diversion
of
drugs
into
illicit
channels.
and
they
could
not
possibly,
in
light
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
have
intended
without
ever
saying
so
to
have
exempted
physicians
because
the
law
was
clear
at
the
time
they
enacted
the
controlled
substances
act
that
physicians
were
covered
by
the
old
harrison
narcotic
act,
and
we
do
not
think
that
given
what
congress
knew,
they
by
their
silence
intended
to
exempt
the
physicians.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
well
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
essentially,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that,
that
he
could
only
be
prosecuted
under
842
or
possibly
843
if
he
did
things
like
--
they
were
covered
by
that
statute.
842
(a)
(1)
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
particularly
referred
to
which
is
a
statute
which
prescribes
someone,
which
makes
it
originally
a
civil
penalty
unless
you
do
it
knowingly,
to
distribute
or
dispense
a
controlled
substance
without
the
prescription
of
829.
now,
judge
mckinnon
(ph)
in
his
dissent
said
that
if
you
are
not
prescribing
for
legitimate
medical
purpose
then
it
is
not
really
a
prescription,
and
therefore,
you
could
be
punished
under
842
(a)
(1).
we
are
not
so
sure
that
it
is
not
the
prescription.
it
still
looks
like
a
prescription
and
a
pharmacist
sees
it,
he
relies
upon
it
and
he
prescribes.
but
perhaps
more
importantly
than
that,
the
legislative
history
in
the
whole
statutory
scheme
makes
clear
that
842,
and
to
some
extent
843,
really
intends
to
get
at
the
kinds
of
technical
violations
of
a
registration
scheme.
and
the
anomaly
is
that
if
he
writes
a
prescription,
as
dr.
moore
did,
he
may
be
punishable
under
842
(a)
(1),
but
if
he
gives
away
drugs
indiscriminately,
the
analogy
or
the
contrast
that
judge
lombard
used
in
the
rosenberg
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
was,
if
he
stands
in
a
street
corner
giving
out
drugs
or
giving
out
prescriptions,
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
at
all.
but
if
he
writes
it
in
a
piece
of
paper,
which
may
or
may
not
be
for
a
legitimate
medical
purpose,
he
can
be
punished
up
to
one
year.
now,
that
does
not
make
any
sense.
if
he
is
really
selling
drugs,
and
by
selling
prescriptions
he
is
selling
drugs,
he
ought
to
be
treated
like
any
other
trafficker
like
any
narcotics
pusher
because
he
is
really
no
better
than
that.
and
we
think
that
congress
intended
that.
now,
very
briefly,
the
way
we
read
the
statute
and
we
think
the
more
logical
way
to
read
the
statute,
is
not
to
say
that
when
21
u.s.c.
841
(a)
(1)
says,
except
as
authorized
by
this
subject,
they
intend
to
wholly
exempt
a
whole
class
of
people,
but
they
are
talking
about
his
conduct
that
maybe
authorized
by
the
subchapter
because
they
say
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
distribute
or
dispense
a
controlled
substance,
except
as
authorized
by
the
subchapter.
now,
the
kind
of
conduct
involved
is
then
defined
by
other
provisions
of
the
subchapter,
beginning
with
section
(a)
(22)
which
requires
a
registration.
but
the
registration
does
not
authorize
a
person
so
registered
to
do
anything
he
wants
to
with
the
controlled
substance,
but
rather
he
is
permitted
to
dispense
or
distribute
only
to
the
extent
authorized
by
his
registration
and
in
conformity
with
other
provisions
of
the
subchapter.
now,
the
registration,
which
dr.
moore
had
permitted
him
to
dispense
for
detoxification,
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
that
is
not
what
he
was
doing,
he
was
not
dispensing
for
any
legitimate
form
of
medical
treatment.
but
we
do
not
rely
solely
on
that,
we
rely
on
the
--
in
conformity
with
other
provisions
of
this
subchapter
language,
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
sub
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
we
have
not
given
up
the
regulations,
the
way
we
view
the
regulations
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
it
is
in
our
reply
brief
because
we
do
not
think
that
he
was
prosecuted
or
convicted
for
violating
a
regulation.
we
think
that
the
regulation
was
used
really
as
a
helpful
means
for
the
prosecutor,
on
short
notice
without
any
request
for
bill
of
particulars,
to
explain
to
the
court
exactly
what
its
theory
was
because
306.404
(a)
of
the
regulations
defines
in
a
little
more
fully
what
it
is
meant
by
in
the
course
of
professional
practice,
which
is
for
a
legitimate
medical
purpose.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we
have
not
abandoned
our
reliance
upon
as
a
useful
way
of
describing
what
he
did
in
violating
the
statute.
we
do
not
agree
that
it
was
used
by
the
prosecutor
to
set
out
the
criminal
offense.
in
other
words
mr.
bergan
argues
that,
that
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
respondent
was
convicted
of
violating
a
regulation.
we
say
he
was
not
convicted
of
violating
a
regulation.
he
was
convicted
of
violating
a
statute,
which
by
its
terms
explain
what
was
authorized.
prosecutor
used
the
regulation
before
the
court
to
explain
more
fully,
what
the
statute
meant
to
the
extent
that
he
referred
to
306.04
(c)
which
referred
to
methadone
maintenance;
that
described
what
dr.
moore’s
particular
registration
permitted
him
to
do
and
not
to
do.
he
was
permitted
to
detoxify,
not
to
maintain,
but
i
am
pointing
a
fact,
the
theory
of
trial,
was
that
he
did
not
engage
in
any
bona
fide
medical
practice.
the
expert
said
he
did
not
engage
in
practice
which
was
acceptable
either
for
detoxification
or
maintenance.
the
lay
testimony
made
clear
to
anybody
listening
to
it
that
this
was
not
legitimate
medical
practice
for
any
purpose,
and
that
we
say
is
what
the
jury
found,
and
that
is
a
violation
841.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
exactly
right,
and
he
relied
on
two
textbooks,
one
of
which
he
had
taken
out
from
the
library
on
the
morning
the
first
day
of
the
trial
to
support
this
theory,
which
no
else
viewed
as
a
legitimate
form
of
medical
practice.
he
said
at
trial,
and
it
is
in
appendix
of
page
113,
that
it
was
never
his
intention
to
maintain
patients.
my
intent
was
to
detoxify
patients
and
to
get
them
completely
off
of
all
drugs.
i
never
wanted
to
maintain
patients
on
methadone.
i
want
them
to
make
them
completely
drug-free
and
so
to
the
extent
that
we
relied
on
the
regulation,
there
was
no
inconsistency,
no
prejudice
to
respondent,
and
yet
his
testimony
of
trial
was,
what
he
did
was
he
gave
them
as
much
as
they
wanted
to
go
out,
fill
themselves
up
with
methadone,
and
a
new
theory
of
blockading
and
then
they
would
come
back
to
him
and
say
i
am
ready
now
to
detoxify,
that
is
the
second
stage,
i
cannot
take
anymore
methadone,
i
cannot
take
anymore
heroin.
but
when
asked
about
the
second
stage,
which
would
obviously
be
the
crucial
stage
in
that
kind
of
so-called
“treatment”
psychological
counseling,
there
was
none.
a
typical
visit
lasted
from
30
to
60
seconds,
on
one
day
he
prescribed
he
wrote
271
prescriptions,
and
he
was
asked
how
he
could
do
that
in
a
single
day,
how
he
could,
counsel
he
said,
i
either
write
very
fast
or
i
talk
very
fast
and
possibly
both.
that
is
the
kind
of
practice
that
was
involved
here
and
the
statue
we
think
by
its
terms,
by
its
definition
of
dispensing
limited
to
a
practitioner,
by
its
definition
of
practitioner,
which
allows
dispensing
solely
in
the
course
of
professional
practice
which
means
for
a
legitimate
medical
purpose.
congress
intended
that
this
kind
of
drug
trafficker
should
be
covered
by
the
felony
provision,
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
distribute
or
to
sell.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
he
was.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no
question
he
was
a
physician,
and
no
question
he
had
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
except
that
congress
when
it
wrote
the
controlled
substances
act
was
aware
of
that
very
kind
of
problem.
there
is
some
language
in
legislative
history
that
originally
appeared
on
the
prettyman
commission
report
said
that
one
of
the
problems
with
the
harrison
act
was
that
we
are
allowing
federal
prosecutors
to
make
judgments
as
to
what
is
a
legitimate
medical
practice
and
what
ought
not
to
be.
and
so
with
the
controlled
substances
act,
what
congress
said
in
writing
the
controlled
substances
act
is
we
agree
that
ought
not
to
be,
but
on
the
other
hand
drug
abuse
is
too
significant
a
problem
to
allow
this
kind
of
experimentation
by
just
any
physician.
so
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
we
are
going
to
have
a
provision
in
the
statute,
which
allows
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
rather
than
the
attorney
general
to
set
out
what
kinds
of
things
can
be
done.
if
you
want
to
try
a
new
form
of
treatment
--
a
new
form
of
treatment
that
you
want
to
experiment
with,
well,
go
to
the
secretary
of
h.e.w
and
he
will
give
you
a
special
registration
to
do
it
under
the
statute
and
he
will
run
it
by
the
attorney
general,
but
he
will
make
the
judgment.
now,
we
do
not
like
the
idea,
said
congress,
of
having
any
official
in
the
federal
government
defining
what
is
and
is
not
permissible,
but
better
it
should
be
the
secretary
of
h.e.w
than
the
attorney
general,
but
it
has
to
be
somebody.
it
cannot
be
left
to
the
individual
practitioner
because
the
potential
for
abuse
is
simply
too
great
and
so
in
21
u.s.c.
823
(f),
there
were
provision
made
--
there
was
provision
made
for
new
kinds
of
research.
if
you
went
to
the
secretary
of
h.e.w
and
said,
i
want
to
try
this
kind
of
method
instead
and
in
the
new
act,
the
narcotic
addict
treatment
act
of
1974,
congress
took
it
upon
itself
to
put
some
specifics
into
the
law
by
saying
that
you
could
never
prescribe
for
detoxification
or
maintenance.
the
implication
of
the
regulation,
which
was
passed
after
the
narcotic
addict
treatment
act
of
1974,
is
that
it
can
only
be
given
out
in
clinics.
it
cannot
be
prescribed
to
go
to
pharmacist.
so
the
public
health
agency
was
given
the
authority
under
the
controlled
substances
act
to
set
standards.
if
one
complies
with
those
standards
he
obviously
cannot
be
prosecuted.
that
solves
the
problem
of
the
katzenbach
commission
i
mentioned
--
i
mean,
said
the
prettyman
commission
--
i
meant
katzenbach
commission,
had
noted
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statute
is
talking
about
a
problem
of
drug
abuse
and
how
to
control
it.
it
recognized
that
doctors,
pharmacies
are
the
greatest
sources
of
the
illegitimate
distribution
of
narcotics,
it
is
amply
supported
in
the
legislative
history.
how
does
it
deal
with
it?
does
congress
set
out
what
can
and
cannot
be
done?
congress
said
in
the
course
of
professional
practice
for
a
legitimate
medical
purpose.
these
are
terms
which
this
court
had
no
trouble
with
under
the
harrison
act,
and
on
the
evidence
of
this
case
and
in
fact,
if
you
compare
the
facts
of
some
of
the
early
harrison
cases,
jin
fuey
moy
and
webb
(ph),
as
opposed
to
linder
which
was
the
latter
case
in
which
--
what
was
involved
was
four
morphine
tablets,
we
think
that
under
a
definition
of
good
faith
effort
to
treat,
legitimate
medical
purpose
in
the
course
of
professional
practice,
judges
and
juries
can
make
those
kinds
of
judgments
and
evidence
before
them.
and
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
so
blatant,
so
blatant
that
no
one
could
honestly
believe
that
this
man
was
engaged
in
legitimate
medical
practice
in
the
course
of
his
professional
practice.
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
set
up
a
mechanism
to
define
what
can
and
cannot
be
done,
and
there
are
ways
to
find
out
what
you
can
and
cannot
do
helps
to
solve
the
problem.
now,
to
the
extent
that
it
does
not
--
it
may
not
permit
every
single
kind
of
experimentation
in
a
clinic
program
as
opposed
to
in
a
laboratory
or
on
an
experimental
basis,
we
think
it
is
legitimate
for
congress
to
have
made
that
judgment
because
of
the
tremendous
potential
for
abuse
and
danger
and
because
of
what
we
see
in
this
case,
of
the
addicts,
the
methadone
addicts
who
came
into
court
and
testified
as
to
what
dr.
moore
did
to
them,
and
how
much
more
soft
they
were
after
they
went
into
his
program
than
when
they
started
in
his
program.
and
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
am
afraid
[laughter]
well,
my
history
is
not
as
good
as
it
should
be
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
[laughter]
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
in
any
event,
our
position
in
brief
is
that
congress
intended
that
people
like
respondent,
who
engaged
in
the
kind
of
conduct
that
respondent
has
engaged
in,
are
covered
by
841.
that
the
technical
provisions
of
the
statue
are
really
not
enough
and
the
anomaly
of
relying
solely
on
the
technical
provisions,
as
opposed
to
the
provision
for
a
drug
trafficker,
makes
clear
that
congress
really
intended
that
as
does
the
legislative
history.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
despite
an
obvious
awareness
of
some
of
the
problems
we
have
talked
about,
despite
an
awareness
of
what
the
law
was
under
the
harrison
act,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
differentiate
between
practitioners
on
the
one
hand
and
other
drug
traffickers
on
the
other
hand.
if
they
had
wanted
to
change
the
prior
law,
we
think
they
would
have
been
much
more
explicit
in
doing
so.
indeed,
their
awareness
of
physicians
being
the
primary
source
of
diversion
of
drugs
indicates
just
the
contrary.
they
intended
to
give
the
drug
pusher,
the
drug
trafficker,
no
matter
who
he
was
and
the
statutory
language,
the
scheme,
and
the
legislative
history
all
support
that.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
ignored
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
in
concluding
that
as
it
did
and
we
ask
that
its
judgment
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
that
court
for
the
sole
purpose
of
considering
the
problem
relating
to
the
sentencing.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
just
two
quick
comments.
mr.
bergan’s
main
point
i
think
was
that
administrative
controls
ought
to
be
used
instead
of
criminal
prosecution.
i
think
it
bears
emphasizing
that
under
823
(f),
all
doctors
must
be
registered
if
they
are
licensed
to
practice
medicine,
so
it
is
not
a
discretionary
thing
to
deny
them
their
registration.
and
that
there
were
only
three
reasons
for
revoking
registrations
prior
to
the
narcotic
addict
treatment
act
of
1974,
that
is
that
a
registrant
has
materially
falsified
an
application,
that
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
that
he
has
had
his
state
license
or
registration
suspended,
revoked
or
denied.
it
seems
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
evidence
of
the
case,
in
each
case,
and
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
in
the
cases
that
are
now
pending
under
cert
in
this
court,
the
rosenberg
case
and
the
green
case
and
the
jin
fuey
moy
case,
you
will
find
that
in
each
case
it
is
completely
blatant,
and
that
the
uncover
agents
where
they
were
at
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
there
is
no
legitimate
medical
purposes
of
the
test
outside
the
course
of
professional
practice.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
there
are
two
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they
are
permitted
to
dispense
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
if
it
is
a
technical
and
formal
violation
of
their
registrations,
they
are
liable
under
842
and
843
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
congress
set
it
out
in
the
legislative
history.
there
are
certain
things
that
are
technical
violations.
not
using
an
order
form,
not
prescribing
with,
not
using
a
prescription,
in
those
kinds
of
things,
there
are
lesser
penalties,
one
year
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
let
me
give
you
the
exact
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
842
(a)
(1)
says
that
you
are
subject
to
one-year
penalty
if
you
distribute
or
dispense
in
violation
of
829,
and
829
requires
that
you
cannot
dispense
without
the
written
prescription?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
because
then
it
is
not
for
any
legitimate
medical
purpose
in
the
course
of
professional
practice.
but
if
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
it
is
in
the
statute
--
but
that
is
in
the
statue.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
statute
has
two
requirements
that
what
is
authorized
under
841
is
what
is
authorized
to
the
extent
authorized
by
your
registration
and
some
registration
permit
you
to
detoxify,
some
registration
permits
you
to
do
other
things,
some
registration
say
you
can
use
methadone,
but
you
cannot
use
other
forms
of
drugs,
and
secondly,
you
may
only
--
the
only
authorized
activities
are
those
which
are
in
conformity
with
other
provisions
of
the
subchapter.
now,
the
other
provisions
of
the
subchapter
use
the
language
in
the
course
of
professional
practice
and
for
legitimate
medical
purpose,
and
if
what
you
are
doing
is
not
in
the
course
of
professional
practice
and
not
for
a
legitimate
medical
purpose,
then
we
say
you
clearly
violate
841.
and
that
gets
i
think
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
hypothetical,
if
someone
sets
up
a
sign
and
sells
methadone
and
gives
no
treatment
of
any
kind
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
negligence
or
malpractice
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right,
that
is
what
the
regulation
say,
that
is
what
the
statue
says
and
that
is
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
say.
but
we
have
been
able
to
distinguish
what
is
legitimate
and
what
is
not
legitimate,
and
what
is
within
the
scope
of
legitimacy,
and
what
is
so
far
beyond
the
pale
that
under
no
interpretation
could
it
be
considered
legitimate
medical
practice
within
the
course.
thank
you.
