e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
74-759,
united
states
against
moore.
mr.
friedman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
that
relate
to
the
appearance
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
not
rest
whole
his
defense
or
largely
on
the
idea
that
that
is
the
way
he
did
it
under
the
statute
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
what
is
practiced,
and
he
says
that
is
the
way
he
does
things,
even
though
no
one
else
does?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
galileo
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
galileo
did
not
issue
271
prescriptions
for
drugs
in
one
day
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
do
not
think
he
helps
us
very
much
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
friedman.
mr.
bergan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
he
may
have
not
known
that
the
statue
was
not
clear
enough
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
known
he
was
violating
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
relate
that
to
how
he
acted
on
it,
i
am
trying
to
see
whether
you
are
relating
that
in
some
way
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no,
dr.
moore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
he
misled
by
the
statute,
that
is
the
only
one,
i
am
not
concerned
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
all
i
am
interested
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bergan,
on
this
question
of
what
a
doctor
can
do,
i
suppose
hypothetically
you
would
agree
that,
or
perhaps
you
would
not,
that
the
old
practice
of
bleeding
patients
which
was
done
150
to
200
years
ago
is,
let
us
assume
it
is
no
longer
accepted
in
medical
practice,
i
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
because
i
do
not
know,
but
there
was
doctor
who
just
simply
took
his
some
kind
of
a
knife
and
cut-up
one
of
his
patient’s
arteries
and
then
just
went
out
to
play
golf
and
let
the
patient
die
on
the
place
where
he
had
left
him.
do
you
suppose
that
the
--
some
suggestion
that
this
was
not
his
medical
practice
to
his
way
of
treating
patients
would
help
him
on
a
manslaughter
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
undoubtedly,
in
such
a
case
the
prosecution
would
bring
in
physicians
who
would
testify
that
that
was
not
accepted
practice.
presumably,
or
let
us
assume
in
defense
he
would
bring
in
some
kind
of
a
textbook
material
or
some
expert
evidence
that
this
was
a
new
idea
and
that
it
might
be
coming
back
again,
the
bleeding
process,
then
the
jury
would
decide
that
question,
how
does
that
differ
in
terms
of
what
was
submitted
to
the
jury
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
any
significance,
mr.
bergan,
in
the
fact
that
841
is
entitled,
“prohibited
acts?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
bergan.
do
you
have
anything
further
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
bergan,
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-687,
united
states
against
moore.
mrs.
shapiro
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
something
you
could
have
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
very
well.
mr.
harris.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
not
your
theses
put
a
burden
on
the
government
to
make
a
careful
inquiry
into
the
potential
solvency
of
everyone
of
its
contractors
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
on
their
own,
but
--
and
that
means
that
it
has
got
to
affect
their
priorities,
the
government
is
going
to
probably
disfavor
the
great
many
contractors
who
need
the
business,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
statement
was
necessary
to
the
holding
in
that
case
or
was
it
just
a
side
observation
by
way
of
the
dictum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
the
taking
of
this
part
of
the
holding
mandate,
now
does
not
it
refer
to
the
maturity
and
obligation
in
the
conjunctive?
is
there
any
doubt
about
the
obligation
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
contingency
that
the
court
was
referring
to
in
that
language
you
rely
on,
has
both
elements,
maturity
and
obligation,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
not.
that
is
not
true
here,
is
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
obligation?
is
that
the
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
have
settle
though
as
to
(inaudible)
of
the
tax
payers
testing
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
the
events
which
is
precipitated
the
liability
here
all
happened
before
the
insolvency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
just
the
amount
that
is
not
actually
determined.
how
that
is
different
from
a
tax
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
can
we
speculate
about
that?
it’s
a
--mr.
harris,
useful,
is
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mrs.
shapiro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mrs.
shapiro.
thank
you,
mr.
harris.
the
case
is
submitted.

burger
i

the

in
74-687
united
states

moore
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion,
filed
this
morning
with
the

and

case
