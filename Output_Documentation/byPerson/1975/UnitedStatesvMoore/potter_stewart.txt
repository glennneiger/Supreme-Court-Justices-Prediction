are
you
not
in
a
little
--
are
we
not
embarking
on
kind
of
dubious
grounds
when
we
impose
criminal
--
serious
criminal
liability
based
upon
professional
disagreements
among
physicians?
this
defendant
was
a
physician,
was
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
it
not
true
that
historically
most,
if
not
all
of
the
great
breakthroughs
and
advances
in
medical
science
have
been
made
by
people
who
did
not
follow
the
conventional
way
of
doing
things.
they
followed
a
new
way,
their
way,
and
most
of
the
conventional
physicians
of
their
day
would
have
disagreed
with
them
because
this
is
not
the
way
it
has
always
been
done.
and
if
that
is
the
new
--
it
bothers
me
that
this
kind
of
evidence
can
send
a
person
to
prison
for
as
long
as
this
has
been
going,
some
many,
many
years,
but
in
any
event,
that
that
is
the
sort
of
evidence
that
is
the
basis
for
criminal
liability.
this
man
was
a
physician,
he
was
not
a
fraud?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
had
his
way
of
doing
it
and
he
testified
as
to
what
that
way
was
and
it
may
have
been
quite
wrong,
and
it
might
ultimately
turn
out
to
be
very
--
a
very
good
way,
but
the
fact
that
other
physicians
said
that
that
was
not
their
way
should
hardly
make
a
criminal
out
of
this
person?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
does
not
really
solve.
that
sort
of
approach,
under
that
approach
the
world
would
still
be
flat,
if
galileo
had
to
go
and
get
permission
to
--[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
ever
thought
of,
subsequent
history
had
thought
that
it
was
such
a
great
thing
that
galileo
had
gone
to
jail,
however
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
galileo
is
not
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
not
part
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
civil
liability
is
one
thing
and
45
years
in
penitentiary
is
something
a
little
different.
civil
liability
for
negligence
or
malpractice
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
what
justice
white
i
think
was
talking
about,
maybe
i
misunderstood.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
unless
if
you
are
right
that
debts
due
does
include
un-liquidated
claims,
certainly
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
disposing
of
these
insolvent's
estate
for
the
government
to
liquidate
its
claims
as
rapidly
as
possible,
otherwise
this
insolvency
estates
are
going
to
be
tied
up
indefinitely,
if
you
are
correct
in
your
basic
premise?
justice
potter
stewart
you
had
direct
interest.
you
just
told
that
your
interest
is
going
the
other
way,
but
however
would
that
may
be,
the
interest
of
settling
the
insolvency
estate
history
is
very
strong
in
favor
of
getting
these
claims
liquidated
and
then
handled?
justice
potter
stewart
six
years
after
the
assignment?
justice
potter
stewart
liquidated?
