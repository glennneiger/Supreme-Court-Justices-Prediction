justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
read
somewhere
perhaps
along
these
papers
that
the
hew
has
since
amended
or
revised
the
applicable
and
pertinent
regulations
since
this
case
was
filed
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
revision
pertinent
to
the
issue
we
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
your
position?
justice
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
kennan,
in
light
of
our
colloquy
earlier
on
this
clarification
as
you
term
it,
if
you
did
raise
the
issue
of
inconsistency
with
the
federal
statute
rather
than
reach
the
constitutional
question,
why
would
we
not
remand
this
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
clarification?
justice
jr.
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
jr.
provided
the
statutory
issue
is
before
us?
justice
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
suggest
though
mr.
keenan,
the
solicitor
filed
in
response
to
our
invitation
his
memorandum
on
february
18th,
that
is
four
or
five
months
after
the
promulgation
of
the
instruction
and
i
do
not
find
any
reference
to
the
instruction
when
he
filed
and
he
has
not
filed
a
brief
on
the
merits.
this
was
only
in
response
to
our
invitation
at
the
time
that
your
appeal
was
pending,
the
jurisdictional
statement,
before
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
suggest
there
is
no
reference
to
the
instruction,
but
the
solicitor
did
file
in
february?
justice
jr.
it
did
reach
the
constitutional
question
what
must
have
been
at
least
a
premise
that
the
construction
is
contrary
to
the
one
you
urge,
they
reached
the
equal
protection
argument?
justice
jr.
is
the
construction
you
urge
consistent
with
this
so-called
clarification?
does
the
hew,
in
other
words,
agree
with
you
on
that?
justice
jr.
erroneous
as
to
the
statute
--
justice
jr.
--
that
is
the
one
your
urge
and
if
you
are
right,
then
illinois
does
not
have
to
follow
the
instruction?
justice
jr.
that
is
what
i
--
justice
jr.
i
am
looking
forward
to
finish
this
discussion.
tell
us
why
we
should
ignore
the
contrary
interpretation
of
hew?
ordinarily
an
agency’s
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
is
something
which
we
give
considerable
respect,
is
it
not?
justice
jr.
what
are
the
principles
which
entitle
us
to
ignore
it?
justice
jr.
a11?
justice
jr.
f.
justice
jr.
what
would
happen
in
case
and
i
gather
all
these
children
were
sent
to
relatives
because
the
conditions
at
the
foster
home
were
not
what
was
desired,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
whatever
the
reason
was,
they
were
in
foster
homes,
non-related,
were
they
not?
justice
jr.
and
they
then
went
to
the
homes
of
relatives.
justice
jr.
well,
whatever
the
reason
may
be,
now
suppose
the
relatives
say
“well,
we
simply
cannot
afford
without
this
help
to
keep
them,”
now
what
happens
to
the
children?
you
have
to
take
them
back
and
put
them
back
in
foster
home?
justice
jr.
they
are
now
getting
--
these
are
the
named
plaintiffs?
justice
jr.
they
are
getting
the
foster
home
payment?
justice
jr.
how
does
that
compare
to
the
foster
home
payment?
justice
jr.
well,
of
course,
if
your
adversary
is
right
that
there
is
a
conflict
here,
that
your
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
is
inherent
and
that
your
obliged
to
pay
under
the
federal
statute,
then
instead
of
coming
out
of
state
funds
the
foster
payment
would
in
part
at
least
come
out
of
federal
fund.
justice
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
though,
if
they
are
in
fact
receiving
it,
does
the
state
make
any
claim
here
if
there
is
no
controversy,
at
least
as
to
these
named
plaintiffs
and
others,
was
it
certified
as
a
class
action?
justice
jr.
and
yet
all
the
named
plaintiffs,
you
understand,
are
now
receiving
the
full
$105?
justice
jr.
well,
as
to
them,
is
there
still
any
controversy?
justice
jr.
what
about
our
saldana
(ph)
decision?
justice
jr.
on
whether
or
not
there
is
still
a
class
action
for
us
to
decide
of
all
the
named
plaintiffs
without
a
class?
justice
jr.
meaning,
all
foster
homes
will
be
getting
something
less
than
$105.
justice
jr.
not
immediately.
justice
jr.
if
a
mother
is
declared
unfit
or
a
father
declared
unfit,
for
that
reason
the
child
has
been
removed
from
their
care,
is
it
very
likely
that
you
are
going
to
commit
that
child
to
that
mother
or
father
again?
