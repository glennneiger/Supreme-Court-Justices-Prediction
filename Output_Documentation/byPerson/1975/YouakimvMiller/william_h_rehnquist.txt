justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
read
the
district
court’s
opinion,
they
did
not
pass
on
any
statutory
question.
they
simply
treated
the
equal
protection
contention
and
ruled
it
against
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
district
court
opinion?
is
that
at
page
59
of
the
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
take
from
page
55
of
the
appendix,
where
the
district
court
has
this
--
its
opinion
ahead
at
the
merits
to
page
60,
they
simply
concluded
at
the
end
“the
illinois
scheme
does
not
deny
plaintiffs
equal
protection
of
the
law.
the
summary
judgment
is
entered
in
favor
of
the
defendants.”
i
think
you
are
somewhat
hard
pressed
to
show
they
squarely
addressed
any
statutory
contention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
--
did
you
allege
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
federal
statute
and
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
keenan,
in
your
prayer
for
relief
on
page
16
of
the
appendix,
consisting
of
a
number
of
paragraphs
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
and
f,
looking
at
paragraph
e,
you
asked
that
the
three-judge
court
enter
a
final
judgment
permanently
enjoin
the
state
director,
agents,
etcetera
acting
in
concert
from
enforcing,
applying,
or
executing
illinois
revised
statutes
and
illinois
family
serve
as
placement
management
as
written
because
said
statutes
and
regulations
violate
equal
protection
of
the
law
as
guaranteed
by
plaintiffs
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
is
the
only
thing
that
i
can
find
in
your
prayer
for
relief
that
suggest
the
basis
for
invalidating
those
statutes,
and
that
is
strictly
a
constitutional
claim?
