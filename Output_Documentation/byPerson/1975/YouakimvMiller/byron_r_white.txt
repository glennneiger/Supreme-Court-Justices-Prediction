were
you
aware
of
this
program
instruction
when
the
case
was
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
january
of
1974?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
october
and
then
you
took
your
notice
of
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
from
what
you
say,
you
certainly
would
not
object
from
a
decision
on
your
behalf
based
on
a
statutory
ground
whether
these
decision
issues
in
the
district
court
are
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
just
like
to
get
it
over
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
not
agree
now
that
the
statutory
ground
has
emerged
clearly
and
you
insist
that
it
is
in
the
case,
do
you
not
agree
that
that
has
to
be
reached
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
statutory
ground
had
been
reached
in
the
district
court
at
first
and
it
had
been
decided
in
your
favor?
the
case
could
never
have
gotten
here
directly,
could
it?
justice
white
is
that
not
what
the
district
court
decided?
justice
white
you
did
not
present
this
argument
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
did
you
make
this
argument
that
you
are
making
now
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
argument
takes
you
farther
than
the
district
court
took
you,
would
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
state
would
be
getting
more
relief
if
we
decided
in
your
favor
on
this
ground
than
you
got
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
you
say
under
the
social
security
act,
the
state
does
not
have
to
pay
them
anything
to
related
foster
parents?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
are
not
foster
parents?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
parents
for
the
purposes
of
afdc?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
as
foster
parents.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
you?
what
are
you
reading?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
won
here,
would
they
continue
to
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
the
state
is
treating
all
the
children
living
with
relatives?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
other
members
of
the
class,
you
can
see
there
are
other
members
of
the
designated
class
other
than
the
named
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
foster
care
not
arise
when
the
state
has
made
the
child
a
dependent
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
saying
and
illinois’
practice
has
been
that
even
when
that
happens,
when
they
remove
the
child
from
the
home
of
a
relative
and
then
place
the
child
with
another
relative,
you
have
not
treated
that
relative
as
a
foster
parent
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
federal
law
certainly
would
not
require
the
state
to
pay
foster
care
amounts
to
a
mother?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
a
grandfather.
it
would
only
be
when
the
state
adjudicates
the
person
a
foster
child
or
makes
him
a
dependent
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
what
the
definition
says
that
you
read
to
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
understand
your
opponent’s
position
to
be
that
the
federal
law
requires
foster
care
payments
to
relatives
even
though
the
state
has
not
adjudicated
the
child
and
made
it
a
dependent
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
as
long
as
the
state
does
not
and
need
not
declare
the
child
a
foster
child,
it
is
only
requirement
is
to
pay
afdc?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
time
that
child
is
removed
from
the
family
is
because
for
some
reason.
now,
what
reason
would
it
be?
it
would
not
be
just
to
get
more
money.
it
would
be
because
the
child
is
not
being
cared
for
properly.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
state
is
not
about
to
put
it
back
in
that
home
that
it
has
declared
to
be
unfit?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
for
a
long
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
not
going
to
end
up
in
a
home
from
which
he
was
removed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
concede
that
he
certainly
has
to
be
removed
from
the
home
of
a
relative
on
the
grounds
that
--
and
be
made
a
foster
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
social
security
act
nor
you
can
force
that
to
be
done
except
for
a
good
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
before
you
are
through,
where
the
order
certifying
that
class
action
is
to
be
found,
is
it
in
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
and
there
are
members
of
that
class
still
around
even
though
the
named
plaintiffs
may
not
have
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
between
the
named
plaintiffs
and
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
still?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
if
the
state
won
it
might
terminate
the
stay?
