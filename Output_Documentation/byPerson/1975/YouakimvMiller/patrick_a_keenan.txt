mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
illinois
foster
care
payment
scheme
denies
the
federal
foster
care
payments
to
children
who
are
placed
in
foster
homes
maintained
by
their
relatives.
the
issues
in
this
case
are;
first,
whether
the
denial
by
the
state
of
illinois
violates
the
social
securities
act
and
the
supremacy
clause,
and
second,
whether
that
denial
violates
equal
protection.
the
best
evidence
that
the
illinois
foster
care
payment
scheme
is
in
violation
of
the
social
securities
act
is
found
in
the
position
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
the
department
charged
with
the
stewardship
of
administration
of
the
social
security
act.
twice;
first,
in
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
department
by
the
solicitor
general
in
response
to
this
court’s
invitation,
and
second,
in
a
program
instruction
issued
as
recently
as
october
of
1974,
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
has
unequivocally
taken
the
position
that
such
payments
must
be
afforded
to
related
foster
parents.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
that
program
instruction
is
consistent
with
the
existing
regulations,
mr.
justice,
in
the
plaintiffs’
view.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
it
is
consistent
with
it.
there
is
nothing
--
the
regulations
do
not
speak
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
payments
can
be
made.
i
respectfully
cite
this
court
to
its
ruling
in
townsend
versus
swank
and
the
test
therein
contained
which
states
that
absent
clear
evidence
on
the
face
of
the
statute
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
states
have
the
option
to
withhold
the
payments
from
a
particular
group
of,
otherwise
eligible
citizens,
that
those
payments
should
be
afforded.
i
would
also
respectfully
cite
this
court
to
its
recent
decision
in
the
case
of
philbrook
versus
glodgett.
in
that
case,
the
state
of
vermont
attempted
to
exercise
the
option
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
tell
its
citizens
that
they
had
to
accept
eligibility
for
the
lower
of
two
levels
--
the
lower
of
two
categorical
assistance
programs
for
which
they
might
be
eligible.
the
state
of
illinois
here
is
trying
to
do
essentially
the
same
thing.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
it
is
not
contained
in
the
regulations,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
contained
in
the
october
1974
program
instructions
which
are
set
out
in
the
appellant’s
brief
at
page
27
and
the
pages
following.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
think
it
is
not
a
revision,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
think
that
it
is
a
revision
of
hew’s
of
one
position
that
have
been
previously
taken
by
one
regional
administrator
by
hew,
but
prior
to
this
very
clear
program
instruction,
i
think
that
the
washington
legal
department
of
hew
had
not
rendered
a
specific
opinion
on
this.
i
think
in
1974,
after
this
case
have
been
filed
before
this
court,
after
the
district
courts
in
south
dakota
and
ohio
had
decided
this
identical
question
the
same
way
the
plaintiffs
now
urge
upon
this
court,
then
hew
saw
fit
to
clarify
what
it
regarded
to
be
confusion
on
the
parts
of
illinois
and
certain
other
states.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
it
does,
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
think
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
district
court
entertained
the
statutory
contention
to
the
following
extent.
the
three-judge
court
specifically
stated
that
it
found
the
illinois
foster
care
scheme
to
be
consistent
with,
rather
than
in
conflict,
the
purposes
of
the
illinois
foster
care
scheme
to
be
consistent
with
the
federal
statutes
as
the
plaintiffs
had
urged
in
their
arguments
and
briefs
below
and
in
oral
argument.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
yes,
your
honor.
apart
from
being
inconsistent
with
the
federal
scheme,
the
illinois
scheme
in
general
seems
to
parallel
it
and
then
at
footnote,
it
cites
the
illinois
exception
to
policy
scheme
and
i
think
that
is
about
the
only
extent
to
which
the
district
court
entertained
the
statutory
interpretation
question.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
would
candidly
admit
to
your
honor
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
illinois
scheme
violates
the
social
security
act
or
is
in
inconsistent
with
the
social
security
act
was
much
more
fully
briefed
in
the
appeal,
and
that
is
the
case
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
is
just
the
way
the
case
came
up
in
the
district
court
and
i
will
admit
that
i
have
learned
a
considerable
amount
about
statutory
interpretation
law
since
this
complaint
was
originally
filed
some-three
years
ago,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
we
alleged
that
it
violated
the
purposes
of
the
federal
act
and
it
violated
the
purposes
of
the
state
law
which
must
be
consistent
with
the
federal
law,
because
in
order
to
participate
in
the
categorical
assistance
programs
under
title
v,
the
purposes
of
the
state
law
must
be
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
federal
law,
and
the
overriding
purpose
which
the
plaintiffs
allege
is
violated
is
that
the
law
must
be
administered
and
executed
in
order
to
maintain
and
strengthen
families,
and
the
illinois
foster
care
payment
scheme,
as
it
is
now
written,
creates
an
economic
disincentive
to
that.
it
pulls
families
apart,
as
happened
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
think
it
more
appropriate,
your
honor,
that
this
court
retain
its
jurisdiction
and
decide
the
issue
on
the
merits.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
no,
whatever
issue
this
court
decides
of
course,
but
this
court
traditionally
entertains
the
statutory
interpretation
issue
and
seeks
grounds
for
decision
other
than
the
constitutional
one.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
provided
the
statutory
issue
is
before
you
and
i
think
it
is
sufficiently
raised
by
the
allegation
in
the
complaint;
first,
that
the
illinois
foster
care
payment
scheme
violates
the
purpose
of
the
federal
law
and
second,
by
the
language
in
the
district
court
opinion
which
would
specifically
--
which
i
would
call
a
finding
to
the
effect
that
the
illinois
foster
care
payment
scheme
does
not
--
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
law,
but
it
rather
parallels
it.
i
think
that
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
make
that
as
a
finding.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
the
plaintiffs
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
position
of
the
department
of
hew
thinks
that
it
is.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
would
urge
that
this
court
should
not.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
believe
this
matter
is
necessary
for
decision,
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
only
method
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
has
to
enforce
what
it
regards
to
--
what
is
absent
in
the
opinion
by
this
court,
merely
an
opinion
by
counsel
which
will
obviously
be
disagreed
with
by
the
attorney
generals
of
the
states
which
have
the
scheme
similar
to
illinois,
the
only
method
that
hew
has
of
enforcing
this
is
conducting
a
compliance
hearing.
now,
compliance
hearings
have
been,
how
i
would
say,
quite
unsuccessful
in
securing
immediate
compliance.
it
is
not
secret
that
the
illinois
foster
care
--
that
the
illinois
child
welfare
payment
scheme
in
general
is
fraught
with
confusion.
i
would
expect
that
to
be
the
case
in
other
states.
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
retain
its
jurisdiction
that
the
policy
of
securing
uniform
national
administration
of
the
social
security
act,
particularly
title
v
of
the
social
security
act,
would
be
much
better
served
than
by
leaving
it
with
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
i
believe
if
this
court
were
to
remand
with
instructions
to
the
state
of
illinois
that
they
should
follow
this
new
program
instruction,
that
the
attorney
general
would
advise
the
officials
of
the
state
along
the
lines
that
he
has
urged
in
his
brief,
that
is
that,
we
do
not,
this
is
the
state
speaking,
“the
state
of
illinois
does
not
believe
this
to
be
a
binding
advisement
or
a
binding
policy
on
the
part
of
hew,”
because
they
say
so
in
their
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
it
might
indeed,
your
honor,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
and
that
the
purposes
of,
first
of
all,
efficiency
in
national
administration
and
the
speedy
justice
would
be
much
better
served
if
this
court
were
to
retain
its
jurisdiction
and
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits.
this
case
is
about
three-and-a
half
years
old
already,
your
honor,
and
the
named
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
plaintiff
class,
if
their
contention
is
correct,
they
have
suffered
a
violation
of
their
rights
to
categorical
assistance
payments
under
the
social
security
act.
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
remand
and
then
sends
it
back
to
the
district
court,
two
of
the
judges
of
which
are
no
longer
available
to
sit,
one
of
the
judge
of
course
being
judge
stevens,
then
it
is
going
to
be
another
lengthy
and
complex
process
before
the
case
can
be
resolved.
i
think
if
this
court
were
to
retain
its
jurisdiction
and
decide
the
case
on
its
merits
that
would
avoid
the
problem
of
the
possibility
of
illinois
and
other
states
continuing
their
conflicting
interpretation,
continuing
their
position
that
this
october
1974
program
guideline
is
not
binding,
is
not
an
accurate
representation
of
what
the
social
security
act
requires.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
entertain
the
rule
of
construction
of
pleadings
that
is
particularly
on
cases
that
are
decided
in
summary
on
motion
to
dismiss
or
on
a
summary
judgment
as
this
case
was,
that
if
the
well-pleaded
facts
of
the
complaint
set
out
any
basis
on
which
the
trial
court
can
grant
relief
that
the
court
should
grant
that
relief,
whether
or
not
that
issue
was
raised
on
the
law.
the
facts
of
the
complaint
were
well-pleaded.
there
were
affidavits
filed
on
both
sides.
we
respectfully
urge
that
for
purposes
of
this
court’s
jurisdiction
that
the
district
court
should
have,
notwithstanding
the
failure
to
pray
for
an
injunction
on
strictly
statutory
interpretation
grounds
in
the
prayer,
that
the
district
court
should
have
recognized
that
issue,
seized
it
and
granted
the
relief.
in
other
words,
the
law
is
the
law.
if
the
illinois
scheme
is,
in
fact,
in
violation
of
the
social
security
act,
then
first
the
trial
court
and
then
i
would
respectfully
ask
that
this
court
recognize
that
and
enter
the
appropriate
judgment.
i
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
effects
of
reversal.
the
state
may
take
the
position
that
increased
expenditures
will
be
the
result
if
the
present
foster
care
payment
scheme
in
illinois
is
invalidated.
i
respectfully
urge
upon
this
court
that
that
would
not
follow.
that
what
would
in
fact
happen
if
relatives
were
available
for
foster
care
placement
that
first
there
would
be
a
movement
of
children
who
are
now
placed
in
stranger’s
homes
into
the
homes
maintained
by
their
relatives.
that
would
mean
two
things.
first,
there
would
be
a
number
of
already
licensed,
already
recruited,
and
already
available
foster
homes
maintained
by
strangers
that
illinois
could
place
its
wards
in,
second
i
think
there
would
be
a
movement
of
these
children
out
of
institutional
placements
into
placement
with
relatives.
the
third
possible
effect
would
be
that
the
process
of
recruiting
foster
homes
would
be
much
simplified.
under
the
present
scheme,
the
placement
worker
does
not
look
first
to
the
relatives
for
a
place
in
which
to
put
a
child,
even
though
the
federal
law
requires
it,
even
thought
the
state
law
requires
it.
the
federal
law
is
unquestionably
clear
that
if
it
is
at
all
possible
for
a
ward
of
the
state
to
live
with
relatives
that
that
would
be
the
best
placement
for
the
ward
assuming
--
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
they
do
not
do
it,
your
honor
because
of
the
scheme
which
precludes
licensing
of
relatives
and
in
the
placement
worker’s
mind
that
prevention
of
licensing
means
that
they
simply
do
not
look
first
to
the
relatives.
they
look
first
to
the
strangers,
and
the
result
is
that,
as
soon
as
the
child
is
declared
a
ward
of
the
juvenile
court,
the
placement
worker
who
has
a
heavy
case
load
and
is
under
pressure
to
remove
the
child
from
the
home,
that
the
court
has
of
course
ordered
the
child
to
remove
from,
must
find
a
place
quickly
and
the
first
place
they
look
is
an
already
licensed
foster
home
because
that
has
been
the
practice
in
the
state
and
because
that
is
the
way
the
statute
is
set
up.
too
often,
placement
workers
have
approached
a
relative
and
say
“can
you
take
in
this
child
who
is
a
ward
of
the
court?”
the
relative
said
as
did
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
“we
would
like
to,
but
we
cannot
afford
it.
we
cannot
afford
to
subsidize
what
it
clearly
the
state’s
obligation.”
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
the
plaintiffs
respectfully
urge
that
what
is
illegal
cannot
be
rational
in
terms
of
equal
protection
jurisprudence.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
think
it
would
not
be
rational
because
it
would
be
--
because
such
a
position
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
illinois
would
be
based
on
a
mistake
of
law.
the
illinois
--
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
it
is
of
course
a
tradition,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
that
tradition
cannot
form
a
rational
basis
for
legislative
action
in
the
united
states
in
1970,
your
honor,
particularly
when
the
illinois
legislature
has
stated
that
the
only
persons
who
are
responsible
for
the
care
of
children
are
the
natural
and
adoptive
parents.
the
illinois
legislature,
by
enacting
that
law,
recognized
that
willing
as
the
relatives
might
be
to
discharge
their
moral
duty
if
the
court
please
and
to
take
in
and
to
take
care
of
their
relatives,
that
it
is
simply
not
economically
feasible,
and
i
respectfully
cite
to
the
court
once
again
to
what
occurred
in
this
case.
the
youakim
subsidized
the
state’s
obligation
as
heavily
as
they
could.
they
took
in
two
of
the
children
and
kept
them
for
as
long
as
they
can,
but
they
could
not
take
in
the
other
two
because
they
could
not
afford
to
further.
the
state
has
the
obligation
to
maintain
those
children.
the
congress
has
recognized
that
they
are
more
expensive
to
maintain
than
children
who
are
removed
in
the
homes
than
children
who
are
kept
in
the
homes
of
the
parents
or
caretaker
--
in
the
homes
of
parents
or
caretaker
relatives.
it
seems
that,
in
light
of
the
clear
expression
by
the
congress
that
these
children
should
be
placed
with
relatives,
any
enactment
by
the
congress
of
the
economic
tools
in
which
to
arrange
it
and
the
statement
by
the
illinois
legislature
that
no
one
save
the
natural
or
adoptive
parents
or
the
state
guardian
has
the
legal
duty
to
take
care
of
it,
then
it
is
not
rational
for
the
state
to
proceed
on
that
assumption
given
the
economic
realities
of
the
state
of
illinois
right
now.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
the
standards
which
are
imposed
upon
the
plaintiff-related
foster
parents
are
identical
to
the
standards
imposed
upon
all
other
foster
homes.
the
duties
of
the
plaintiff-related
foster
parents
are
identical
to
the
duties
of
all
foster
parents
in
the
state
of
illinois.
the
expense
of
maintaining
a
larger
home,
one
that
has
a
separate
bedroom
for
the
foster
child,
of
maintaining
a
cleaner
home,
of
maintaining
higher
standards
of
child
care,
of
maintaining
a
better
family
environment
according
to
the
detailed
regulations
set
out
in
the
requirements
for
foster
homes
in
illinois
are
all
imposed
upon
the
plaintiffs.
the
only
thing
that
is
does
not
go
along
with
the
package
is
the
financial
assistance
to
the
child
which
the
child
needs
to
stay
in
such
a
home.
it
does
costs
more
--
it
costs
the
same
and
i
think
the
state
should
concede
that
it
costs
the
same
to
maintain
a
child
in
a
foster
home
maintained
by
his
relatives
as
it
costs
to
maintain
a
child
in
a
foster
home
maintained
by
a
stranger.
certainly,
they
have
to
comply
with
the
same
standards.
certainly,
they
have
to
submit
to
the
same
amount
of
government
intervention.
they
have
to
file
the
same
reports.
the
parents
have
the
same
duties.
yet,
only
in
the
case
of
the
plaintiffs’
children
does
the
state
say
to
the
children
“we
will
not
pay
all
your
expenses
and
unless
your
relatives
are
willing
to
subsidize
part
of
my
that
is
the
state’s
guardianship
obligation
to
support
you,
you
may
not
live
in
what
congress
has
declared
to
be
the
best
possible
placement
for
you.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
the
program
instruction
was
issued
after
the
district
court’s
opinion
was
written,
your
honor.
the
district
court
filed
its
opinion
in
--
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
--
january
or
february
of
1974,
your
honor,
and
the
program
instruction
was
issued
in
october.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
in
april
of
1974
so
the
record
was
closed
and
the
case
was
pending
before
this
court
at
the
time
the
program
instruction
issued.
i
also
note,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
may
be
important
that
this
court
invited
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
to
address
itself
in
an
amicus
brief
to
this.
that
invitation
issued
to
the
solicitor
and
thence
i
presume
over
to
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
in
october
1974,
i
think
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
this
clarification
resulted
from
the
considerable
legal
research
that
was
done
in
the
solicitor’s
office
as
a
result
of
this
court’s
invitation.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
speculative
upon
my
part
that
there
is
interlocking
causation
between
those
two
events.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
write
the
brief
for
them.
that
is
the
only
answer
i
can
possibly
make.
i
would,
if
the
court
pleases,
if
there
are
no
questions--
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
would
not,
your
honor.
i
urge
that
--
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
certainly
would
and
certainly
a
decision
from
this
court
would
have
a
much
quicker
effect
on
giving
national
uniform
execution
of
title
v.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
i
do,
your
honor
and
i
am
respectfully
urging
that
this
court
reach
that
ground
first
and
it
properly
decides
this
case
as
it
did
in
the
townsend
case,
as
it
has
decided
a
series
of
other
social
security
cases.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
respectfully
reserve
about
five
minutes
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
thank
you.
once
again,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
of
mootness,
three
of
the
four
named
minor
plaintiffs
began
receiving
the
exception
to
policy
payments
which
they
considered
to
be
foster
care
payments
some
28
months
after
the
suit
was
filed
i
believe.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
the
saldana
(ph)
case,
and
i
would
also
cite
this
court’s
recent
opinion
in
gerstein
v.
pugh
and
the
federal
rule
that
says
the
state
must
apply
to
the
district
court
if
it
wishes
to
moot
the
case.
second,
with
respect
to
the
state’s
contention
that
the
plaintiff-related
foster
parents
are
not
foster
parents;
first,
i
would
cite
to
the
district
court’s
opinion
where
it
named
them,
the
district
court
said
that
they
were
foster
parents.
second,
citing
this
court
to
the
federal
foster
care
blueprint,
section
408
of
the
act,
foster
care
payments
can
be
made
to
children
placed
in
the
home
of
any
individual.
now,
under
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
shay
case,
i
think
any
means
any
and
had
congress
meant
any
individual
to
mean
any
individual
other
than
relatives,
it
would
have
in
section
--
if
congress
had
meant
those
payments
to
be
denied
relatives,
it
would
have
set
out
in
section
408,
the
enumerated
relatives
in
section
606(a).
it
did
not.
when
congress
said
foster
care
payments
can
be
made
to
children
who
are
wards
of
the
state
placed
in
the
home
of
any
individual,
it
meant
precisely
what
it
said.
the
interpretation
urged
by
the
state
of
illinois,
i
think,
is
a
tortured
one
and
i
think
the
one
urged
by
the
plaintiffs
is
a
simple
one.
congress
examined
children
who
had
been
removed
from
the
home
of
their
parents
or
a
relatives,
most
usually
their
parents,
and
who
were
declared
wards
of
the
state,
and
it
says
and
it
recognized
that
those
children
were
more
expensive
to
care
for
and
it
further
recognized
in
section
401
of
the
act
that
the
best
possible
placement
for
those
children
was
with
a
relative.
i
think
it
is
not
relevant
whether
or
not
the
child
was
removed
from
a
home
of
its
parents
or
from
the
home
of
his
relatives.
i
think
with
respect
to
the
question
--
let
me
go
back
to
that.
i
think
it
not
relevant
the
nature
whether
or
not
he
was
removed
from
his
parents
or
his
relatives
because
he
meets
the
criterion,
the
characteristics
of
need
which
the
congress
declared
in
order
to
make
him
eligible
for
the
categorical
assistance
payments
under
section
408.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
absolutely,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
only
at
the
discretion
of
the
state’s
attorney
in
illinois
and
on
the
judgment
of
the
juvenile
court
judge,
and
the
suggestion
that
foster
care
payments
could
go
down,
the
plaintiffs
simply
do
not
understand.
i
think
this
court’s
opinion
or
the
decision
in
this
case,
one
way
or
another,
is
not
going
to
have
any
effect
on
the
number
of
dependency
and
neglect
petitions
that
are
filed
in
juvenile
courts
in
the
state
of
illinois,
and
those
foster
care
payments
are
federally
subsidized
to
the
extent
of
$100.
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
going
to
cost
any
more
money
one
way
or
the
other.
all
that
is
going
to
happen
is
that
these
children
will
not
be
placed
in
the
homes
of
strangers
which
the
congress
disapproves,
but
they
will
be
placed
in
foster
homes
maintained
by
their
relatives,
which
would
serve
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
it
would
serve
the
purposes
of
the
state
law
to
maintain
and
strengthen
families.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
at
page
54
of
the
appendix
which
is
the
--
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
yes,
indeed,
there
are,
your
honor.
it
is
the
plaintiffs’
position
that
a
controversy
exists,
by
the
way,
between
them
and
the
state.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
absolutely.
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
still,
because
the
exception
to
policy
payments
are
discretionary
and
can
be
withdrawn
at
any
time.
congress
meant
for
those
categorical
assistance
payments
to
be
made
because
of
the
nature
--
because
of
the
characteristics
of
the
child,
that
is,
that
he
was
removed
from
the
home
--
mr.
patrick
a.
keenan
it
could
tomorrow,
yes.
with
respect,
finally,
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
about
the
tradition;
it
is
true
that
traditionally
relatives
take
care
of
their
own,
but
a
lot
of
traditions
in
this
country
were
changed
in
the
30s
when
the
social
security
act
was
passed
and
they
have
been
continually
changed
in
light
of
the
economic
realities.
i
think
congress
recognized
those
realities
when
it
said
that
any
child
who
was
removed
from
the
home
in
which
he
was
living
and
declared
to
be
a
ward
of
the
state
has
a
right
to
categorical
assistance
payments
under
the
foster
care
scheme.
the
district
court
found
that
the
named
plaintiffs
are
such
children.
this
court
should
recognize
that
they
are
such
children
and
it
should
secure
them
the
rights
and
the
eligibility
for
those
foster
care
payments.
it
should
do
so
because
--
the
plaintiffs
respectfully
urge
it
should
so
because
that
is
required
by
the
social
security
act,
by
the
policy
of
the
federal
and
state
law,
and
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
thank
you,
your
honor.
