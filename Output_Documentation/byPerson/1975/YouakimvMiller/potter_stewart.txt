justice

and
if
you
are
right
then,
as
my
brother
white
has
suggested,
you
get
more
than
is
accorded
to
you
by
the
district
court
because
there
is
nothing
n
the
district
court
opinion
that
says
that
it
would
be
improper
or
unconstitutional
for
illinois
to
pay
related
foster
parents
the
same
as
unrelated
foster
parents
are
paid.
that
decision
of
the
district
court
simply
says
it
is
not
unconstitutional
to
pay
them
less,
but
your
statutory
argument
now
would
be
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
statute
to
even
consider
related
foster
parents
as
foster
parents?
justice
potter
stewart
this
does
not
show
any
evidence
of
that
and
perhaps
in
response
to
what
my
brother
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
the
complaint
really
does
not
make
a
statutory
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
point
is
that
the
ultimate
extreme
of
your
brotherâ€™s
argument
could
be
that
a
foster
child,
i.e.
a
child
who
had
been
made
a
ward
of
the
state
ends
up
in
the
home
of
his
own
mother
or
father
and
she
gets
not
afdc
payments,
but
she
gets
paid
as
a
foster
parent.
justice
stewart
but
it
going
to
be
another
home,
not
that
home,
right?
