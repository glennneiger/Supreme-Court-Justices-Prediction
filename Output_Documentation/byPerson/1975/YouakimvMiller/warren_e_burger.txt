chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
youakim
against
miller.
mr.
keenan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
clarification,
if
that
is
the
right
word
it,
was
issued
two
years
after
you
law
suit
started,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
on
page
28,
about
eight
line
form
the
bottom
--
beginning
about
nine
lines
from
the
bottom,
what
does
that
language
mean?
“the
foster
care
rate
of
payment
prevails
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
foster
home
is
operated
by
a
relative.”
is
that
now
binding
on
all
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
sent
the
case
back,
would
that
not
dispose
of
it,
if
we
remanded
the
case
along
the
lines
that
mr.
justice
brennan
had
just
hypothesized
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
we
decide
matters
that
are
not
necessary
for
decision
up
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
were
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
this
with
new
directive,
might
that
not
have
something
to
do
with
their
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
conventional
for
a
state
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
kin
folk,
if
we
may
call
them
that,
have
a
greater
obligation
to
take
care
of
their
relatives
than
strangers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
does
not
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
it
not
been
a
tradition,
going
back
not
just
to
the
history
of
this
country,
but
to
all
civilized
people
that
people
take
care
of
their
own?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
tradition
as
you
say,
cannot
form
a
rational
basis
for
a
legislative
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
not
go
into
the
home
of
a
person
who
is
related,
there
are
no
standards
or
i
will
put
that
as
a
question,
are
there
any
standards
by
which
the
environment
can
be
measured
by
the
state
as
distinguished
from
going
into
the
home
of
a
licensed
foster
parent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bargiel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
met
the
burden
of
showing
that
they
needed
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
take
it,
your
position
is
that
the
denial
of
equal
protection
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
the
true
foster
care
category
gets
the
$105
without
any
showing
and
his
clients
have
to
make
a
showing
of
need
to
get
the
difference
between
$63
and
$105,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
not
have
any
other,
the
facts
being
what
they
are
now,
that
they
are
receiving
the
full
$105,
he
would
not
have
any
other
basis,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
named
plaintiffs
are
in
a
different
position
from
the
foster
home
people
in
that
if
the
relatives
cannot
continue
to
maintain
their
showing
of
need,
they
might
go
back
down
to
$63,
hypothetically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there
is
a
difference
in
the
burden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
difference
in
the
burden
in
the
sense
that
they
must
show
a
need,
the
relatives
must
show
a
need
above
$63?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
say
they
do
so.
i
said,
is
that
not
the
tradition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
degree
of
relation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
keenan,
you
have
about
six
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
