mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
paul
bargiel
and
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
illinois
and
i
represent
the
illinois
department
of
children
and
family
services
in
this
matter.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
controversy
as
presented
involves
two
different
aspects.
the
first
of
those
is,
can
a
relative
under
the
social
security
act
ever
be
a
foster
parent
and
secondly,
if
a
foster
parent
is
paid
additional
assistance
over
and
above
what
a
relative
is
paid
for
to
care
for
a
needy
and
dependent
child,
can
that
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
i
would
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
first
aspect
of
the
case
at
this
time.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
provisions
of
title
v
of
the
afdc
program,
support
the
conclusion
that
relatives
are
not
foster
parents
and
are
not
eligible
for
aid
under
the
provisions
of
section
608.
the
basic
afdc
program
set
out
in
title
v
defines
essentially
three
classes
of
needy
or
dependent
children
who
are
eligible
for
aid.
section
606
defines
the
first
class
and
says
that
a
dependent
child
is
one
who
is
deprived
of
parental
support
for
certain
specified
reasons
and
lives
with
a
relative
specified
in
section
606.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
your
honor,
the
district
court
decided
that
there
was
no
denial
of
equal
protection
and
it
made
the
determination
that
the
illinois
welfare
scheme
rather
than
running
contrary
to
the
federal
statute
is
parallel
to
the
federal
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
we
presented
the
argument
that
the
--
we
took
the
position
that
the
illinois
welfare
scheme,
to
the
extent
that
it
was
presented,
we
took
the
position
that
the
illinois
welfare
scheme
was
consistent
with
the
federal
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
i
did
not
make
the
argument
to
the
district
court.
the
argument
was
made
that
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
true.
i
agree
with
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
suppose
that
it
is
conceivable
in
that
the
federal
district
court
only
decided
the
equal
protection
question,
but
i
think
it
is
certainly
implied
that
the
federal
district
court
would
have,
had
it
considered
or
had
it
made
specific
findings
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
consistency
of
the
illinois
welfare
scheme
to
the
federal
scheme
would
have
found
that
in
fact
they
impliedly
found
that
there
was
no
inconsistency.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
i
would
assume,
your
honor,
that
the
district
court,
had
it
considered
the
statutory
construction
question,
would
have
had
to
determine
the
statutory
construction
in
our
favor
and
that
is
that
there
was
no
difference
between
the
two
if
they
were
to
reach
the
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
i
think
that
is
quite
clear.
the
hew
does
not
agree
with
us
and
that
is,
again,
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
are
urging
this
position,
that
in
addition
to
the
memorandum
which
was
filed,
which
mr.
keenan
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
are
we
going
to
follow
what,
your
honor,
the
new
program
instruction?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
to
my
knowledge,
no
steps
have
been
taken
at
this
particular
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
think
the
state
of
illinois
is
going
to
ignore
it,
but
i
certainly
think
that
the
position
of
the
department
of
children
and
family
services,
as
of
the
last
time
that
i
checked
and
currently
is
that
the
program
instruction
of
hew
is
erroneous
and
does
not
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
our
current
position.
at
least,
it
is
current
as
to
the
time
i
came
here.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
precisely
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
that
is
not
our
position.
our
position
is
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
related
persons,
under
the
social
security
act,
are
not
foster
parents.
by
definition
those
two
categories
are
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
precisely
correct.
we
do
not
say
that
we
are
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
they
are
relatives
for
purposes
of
afdc
and
eligible
under
section
608.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
right,
but
not
as
foster
parents.
our
position
is
not
that
we
do
not
have
to
pay
them
anything,
but
that
they
are
not
eligible
for
categorical
assistance
under
section
608.
my
position
was,
initially,
that
i
would
think
that
the
court
had
it
considered
or
if
it
did
and
i
do
not
know
except
from
the
opinion,
it
would
have
impliedly
had
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
position
that
we
had
take
was
consistent
with
the
social
security
act
before
it
got
to
the
equal
protection
question.
now,
that
traditionally
is
what
they
should
have
done.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i,
in
all
candor
have
to
agree
with
that.
the
question
--
i
came
to
that
realization
as
of
a
couple
of
days
ago,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
it
is
clear
that
the
complaint
raises
only
an
equal
protection
ground
and
it
is
clear
that
the
prayer
for
relief
only
asks
for
relief
on
that
basis
and
the
three-judge
court’s
opinion
only
makes
one
small
reference
to
the
comparison
between
the
illinois
welfare
scheme
and
the
statutory
scheme.
at
any
rate,
that
position
was
argued
by
the
appellants
and
i
certainly
did
not
want
to
be
remiss
in
responding
to
it.
if
i
may,
then
i
will
very
briefly
move
along
and
say
that
our
position
with
regard
to
the
social
security
act
is
that
section
606
sets
out
certain
specified
relatives
and
says
the
children
who
live
with
these
relatives
are
eligible
for
aid,
and
father
and
mother
are
one
of
the
specified
relatives.
section
608,
if
you
move
along,
it
defines
a
dependent
child
as
one,
who
notwithstanding
section
606(a)
of
this
title,
shall
also
include
a
child
who
would
meet
the
requirements
of
section
606(a),
that
is,
that
he
would
be
living
with
a
certain
specified
relative
except
for
his
removal
after
april
30,
1961
from
the
home
of
a
relative
specified
in
section
606
and
then
if
you
drop
down
to
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
am
sorry.
i
apologize,
your
honor.
i
am
reading
from
the
supplement
to
our
brief,
appendix,
it
is
a9
and
it
sets
out
section
608
of
the
social
security
act.
if
i
may,
i
will
start
again.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
very
definitely
true
and
i
certainly
do
not
mean
to
be
disrespectful
in
urging
that
that
particular
program
instruction
is
erroneous,
but
it
is
also
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
i
think,
first,
this
court
has
--
this
court
has
on
occasion,
certainly
more
than
once
come
to
the
conclusion
that
an
hew
interpretation
of
a
statute
was
erroneous.
i
think
burns
v.
alcala
was
such
a
case.
our
position
here
is
that
the
first
that
the
court
ought
to
look
to
the
plain
meaning,
the
words
employed
by
the
congress
in
the
statute
in
attempt
to
discern
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
enacting
a
particular
section
of
the
statute
and
if
the
intent
can
be
discerned
in
that
fashion,
then
it
ought
to
be
followed
and
we
are
suggesting
that
section
608
defines
a
class
of
needy
dependent
children
does
so
in
terms
which
are
so
unambiguous
with
reference
to
the
act
that
only
one
conclusion
is
possible.
one
conclusion
as
a
parent
and
that
is
the
relatives
are
not
foster
parents
and
i
say
if
i
may,
very
briefly
refer
to
court
to
the
language
employed
there.
it
says,
at
the
beginning,
the
term
“dependent
child”
shall,
notwithstanding
section
606(a)
of
this
title,
also
include
a
child
who
would
meet
the
requirements
of
such
section
606(a)
or
of
section
607
of
this
title
except
for
his
removal
after
april
30,
1961
from
the
home
of
a
relative
and
as
a
result
of
a
judicial
determination.
and
we
submit
that
that
part
clearly
indicates
that
section
608,
the
definition
of
dependent
child
is
to
be
applied
notwithstanding
any
specified
relative
in
section
606
and
it
is
also
to
include
a
new
category
of
children
--
the
employment
of
the
words
“also
include”
indicates
that
this
is
a
creation
of
a
new
class,
and
then
it
refers
to
--
further
defines
the
class
as
children
who
are
removed
from
the
home
of
a
specified
relative
and
then
if
you
drop
down
about
five
lines
from
the
bottom
to
what
is
designated
a3,
it
says
“who
was
been
placed
in
a
foster
family
home
or
child
care
institution
as
a
result
as
such
determination.”
so,
we
are
suggesting
that,
there
the
congress
has
employed
the
term
“foster
family
home
or
child
care
institution”
and
above
they
have
talked
about
removing
a
child
from
the
home
of
a
relative
and
we
would
suggest
that
foster
family
home
or
child
care
institution
means
something
other
than
the
home
of
a
relative
because
a
child
was
removed
from
the
home
of
a
relative
and
put
into
a
foster
family
home
or
child
care
institution.
so
we
would
suggest
that
that
language
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
a
foster
family
home
was
a
non-related
home.
and
if
you
go
on,
in
that
very
same
provision
if
you
go
to
page
a11
which
continues
the
reproduction
of
section
608
and
you
go
to
part
f,
part
f
requires
that
any
state
who
intends
to
employ
the
foster
care
program
also
have
a
plan
which,
in
my
language,
the
provision
indicates
in
my
language,
is
to
rehabilitate
the
home
from
which
the
child
came
so
that,
hopefully,
the
child
can
go
back
there
and
it
says,
the
language
here
says
that
it
must
include
a
provision
for
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
f,
it
is
on
a11
and
f,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
am
reading
from
f.
it
says
that
the
state
plan
must
include
a
provision
for
development
of
a
plan
for
each
such
child,
including
periodic
review
of
the
necessity
of
the
child’s
being
in
a
foster
family
home
or
child
care
institution
to
assure
that
he
receives
proper
care
and
that
services
are
provided
which
are
designed
to
improve
the
conditions
in
the
home
from
which
he
was
removed
or
to
otherwise
make
possible
his
being
placed
in
the
home
of
a
relative
specified
in
section
606.
and
we
submit
that
this
provision,
this
requirement
on
the
state
has
no
meaning
whatsoever
once
a
child
is
already
in
the
home
of
a
relative.
these
children
came,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
from
foster
family
homes
where
people
were
unrelated
to
them
or
they
came
from
childcare
institutions,
and
this
provision
in
the
social
security
act
has
no
meaning
to
the
states.
it
has
no
meaning
whatsoever
if
the
purpose
of
the
provision
is
to
require
the
state
to
enable
these
children
or
enable
a
home
from
which
they
came,
which
was
an
unrelated
home,
to
be
such
that
the
children
can
go
back.
it
is
clear.
i
agree
with
counsel
that
children
are
in
the
home
which
is
best
suited
for
them
and
they
are
not
receiving
foster
care
anymore.
i
think
that
is
the
clear
indication
of
these
provisions.
i
think
this
provision
also
indicates
that
foster
care
is
temporary
care
by
definition.
it
is
not
intended
to
be
a
permanent
placement
for
any
child
and
yet
if
you
consider
the
complaint
which
was
filed
in
this
particular
case
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs
and
all
the
necessary
inferences
and
implications
which
come
from
that,
they
suggest
they
are
in
the
best
home
which
is
possible
for
them
and
the
care
which
they
are
receiving
is
not
intended,
at
least
on
their
part,
to
be
temporary
care
but
permanent
care.
so,
we
would
submit
that
that
also
indicates
that
these
people
are
not
foster
parents,
the
children
are
not
foster
children,
and
they
are
not
receiving
foster
care,
certainly
not
under
the
terms
of
the
social
security
act.
that,
in
a
nutshell,
is
our
position
with
regard
to
the
illinois
welfare
scheme
as
it
comports
to
the
social
security
act,
and
therefore,
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
we
would
also
suggest
that,
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
argument
which
is
raised
that
the
distinction
between
relatives
and
unrelated
foster
parents
is
based
upon
differences
which
are
irrationally
related
to
the
foster
care
program.
now,
it
is
clear
that
the
statute
which
creates
the
illinois
department
of
children
and
family
services
has,
as
its
overriding
purpose,
the
care
of
all
the
neglected
children
of
the
state
of
illinois,
and
that
purpose
is
also
reflected
in
the
aid
of
the
families
with
dependent
children
program.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
any
generalization
which
can
be
drawn.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
right.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
yes,
i
do
not
think
we
can
assume
from
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
there
are
two
things
that
can
happen,
your
honor.
one
of
the
things
which
has
not
been
expressed
to
this
point,
but
appears
in
the
brief
is
that
although
we
contend
and
i
do
feel,
that
foster
parents
are
not
the
same
as
relatives
and
congress
would
permit
us
to
pay
more
money
because
they
also,
in
the
social
security
act,
appropriate
more
money
for
foster
care.
the
state
of
illinois
has
a
policy
which
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
whereby
a
related
person
who
cares
for
a
child
who
proves
that
he
or
who
can
prove
that
he
has
need
of
money
in
order
to
continue
to
care
for
that
child
can
receive
up
to
the
full
amount
of
foster
care.
that
is,
the
child
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
these
plaintiffs
in
this
particular
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
are
receiving
$105
payment.
it
is
true
that
when
they
brought
this
case,
they
were
receiving
$63
per
month
which
was
the
afdc
provision.
they
subsequently
made
application
or
they
made
application
at
some
time.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
yes,
that
is
correct.
they
are
getting
from
the
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
they
are
not
getting
the
foster
home
payment.
they
are
getting
$105.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
it
is
the
same
thing
as
they
are
not
--
pardon?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
illinois
--
pardon?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
right.
illinois
has
a
policy
whereby
a
relative
who
cares
for
a
needy
and
dependent
child
who
can
show
that
he
has
special
need
and
requires
more
money
can
get
more
money
up
to
the
same
amount
that
one
would
receive
for
foster
care
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
i
was
told
by
the
chief
counsel
of
the
illinois
department
of
children
and
family
services
that
this
additional
money,
the
difference
between
the
$63
and
$105
is
not
matched
by
federal
funds,
but
comes
from
state
funds.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
very
well
may
be.
yes,
i
assume
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
if
there
is
a
fault
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
would
agree.
i
would
think
not,
but
i
would
say
if
there
is
a
fault
with
it,
in
response
to
your
honor’s
question,
in
that
position
of
my
adversary,
if
there
is
a
fault
with
it,
then
it
is
with
the
social
security
act
because
the
social
security
act
does
not
--
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
program,
and
the
three-judge
court
recognized
this,
does
not
consider
the
need
of
the
parent
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
child
is
eligible
for
aid.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
true
given
that
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
yes,
it
was
certified.
the
three-judge
court
found
that
there
was
a
proper
class
and
that
has
not
been
contested.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
as
to
the
named
plaintiffs?
well,
certainly
not.
there
is
no
controversy
in
the
sense
that
they
have
anything
to
gain
by
this
litigation
personally.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
am
not
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
now,
i
would
--
i
do
not
--
no,
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
am
familiar
with
that
or
not.
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
oh!
i
think
that
is
clear.
there
is
no
controversy
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
getting
the
money.
i
had
submitted
to
the
court
some
xerox
materials
a
couple
of
months
ago
which
indicate
the
named
plaintiffs
are
receiving
extra
money
and
they
have
not
contested
that.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
think
without
question,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
--
i
realize,
of
course,
that
they
received
the
additional
money
after
this
litigation
was
started.
i
frankly
do
not
think
that
that
had
anything
to
do
with
their
receiving
the
money.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
affidavits
filed
in
the
lower
court
which
indicate
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
according
to
an
affidavit,
which
i
believe
was
filed
by
one
of
the
parties
for
plaintiffs’
counsel,
there
were
1,500
relatives
who
care
for
children
who
are
related
to
them
and
of
those
1,500,
140
are
receiving
the
full
amount
pursuant
to
this
exceptions
policy
which
is
about
10
of
the
entire
class
as
designated
by
them
of
all
these
persons,
and
it
is
not
clear
that
the
entire
1,500
have
asked
for
additional
aid
or
attempted
to
show
any
need.
so,
certainly,
they
are
not
the
only
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
unquestionably,
that
is
true,
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
conceivable,
yes,
it
certainly
is.
i
would
not
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
am
sorry.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
unquestionably,
i
say
that
that
is
true,
but
again,
let
me
direct
myself
to
the
question
that
your
honor
first
asked.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
difficulty
with
that
on
an
equal
protection
basis
because
the
federal
act,
the
social
security
act
itself
does
not
require.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
need
of
the
custodian
who
cares
for
the
child.
it
does
not
deal
with
that
question
at
all
under
section
606
or
608
or
607.
eligibility
is
determined
by
the
need
of
the
child
and
under
section
608,
it
has
to
do
with
the
home
from
which
the
child
is
removed.
under
section
608,
an
unrelated
millionaire
could
take
in
a
neglected
child
and
that
family
would
be
eligible
for
afdc,
under
section
608
of
the
home
from
which
the
child
was
taken
had
been
previously
eligible.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
need
is
not
provided
for,
at
least
need
of
the
custodian
in
the
social
security
act
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
with
the
state
saying
“in
order
to
qualify
for
additional
benefits
which
are
not
yours
to
begin
with,
you
must
show
a
need
as
a
custodian.”
i
will
attempt
to
finish
up
very
quickly.
i
would
say
here
too
that
plaintiffs
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
argument
that
is
raised,
the
plaintiffs
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
plight
of
relatives
who
live
with
people
who
are
related
to
them
who
cannot
afford
to
maintain
those
children
if
they
do
not
receive
the
full
foster
care
benefit.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
their
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
there
are
many
neglected
children
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
in
every
state
that
do
not
have
relatives
to
take
care
of
them.
there
just
are
not
any
or
there
are
relatives
who
do
not
consider
or
would
not
consider
taking
care
of
these
children.
now,
it
is
quite
clear,
as
your
honor
points
out,
that
it
has
been
traditionally
true
that
people
take
care
of
their
own
and
people
take
care
of
their
kin
and
so
on,
if
the
state
of
illinois
is
going
to
be
deprived
of
money
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
i
think
that
that
is
the
tradition
or
at
least
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
recognize
that
it
is
more
likely
to
happen
than
it
is
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
blood
relation,
but
at
any
rate
if
what
counsel
suggests
is
to
happen,
then
the
state
of
illinios
will
be
deprived
of
funds.
certainly,
everything
will
not
be
raised
to
$105
benefit.
the
amount
of
money
is
going
to
stay
the
same
and
that
will
be
equalized
probably
somewhere
between
$63
and
$105.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
right,
in
all
probability,
that
is
what
is
going
to
occur
and
then,
conceivably,
relatives
will
be
able
to
receive
more
money.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
under
the
definition,
a
child
would
have
to
be
removed
from
the
home
of
a
relative
and
adjudicated
a
ward
of
the
state,
yes,
that
is
true.
the
specific
language
is
that
he
would
have
to
be
removed
from
the
home
of
a
relative
pursuant
to
a
judicial
determination.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
the
degree
is
the
same.
i
believe
the
state
statute
is
the
same
as
the
federal
statute
here.
i
am
quoting
now
from
page
11
of
our
brief.
section
606(a)
says
that
the
following
relatives
are
eligible
for
assistance;
that
is
father,
mother,
grandfather,
grandmother,
brother,
sister,
stepfather,
stepmother,
stepbrother,
stepsister,
uncle,
aunt,
first
cousin,
nephew,
or
a
niece,
that
is
the
federal
statute.
now,
the
state
statute,
the
pertinent
part
is
reproduced
on
page
13
of
our
brief
and
in
footnote
2.
that
specifies
that
the
child
or
children
must
be
living
with
grandfather,
grandmother,
brother,
sister,
stepfather,
stepmother,
stepbrother,
stepsister,
uncle,
aunt,
or
other
relative
approved
by
the
department.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
direct
parallel
between
the
state
and
federal
law.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
the
federal
law?
no,
i
agree
with
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
am
sorry.
maybe
i
misunderstand
your
honor’s
question.
it
says
“the
federal
law
defines
in
section
608
--
606
a
certain
class
of
relatives,”
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honors
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
okay,
and
that
class
a
relative
includes
father
or
mother.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
and
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
if
a
sister
in
this
case,
when
you
consider
section
606
and
section
608,
if
a
sister
can
be
a
foster
mother
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
can
be
foster
children
then
there
is
no
reason
why
you
cannot
ultimately
get
to
a
situation
where
you
have
a
chain
of
events
which
leads
a
child
back
to
his
father
or
mother
and
have
a
natural
father
or
mother
being
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
oh!
no,
you
have
to
have
--
there
i
will
agree
with
you.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
yes,
i
certainly
agree
with
that.
as
long
as
that
does
not
happen
to
the
child
who
lives
with
a
relative,
that
is
true.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
precisely
correct.
that
is
the
natural
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
but
it
does
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
it
has
an
obligation
to
determine
or
to
see
that
that
home
can
be
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
certainly,
at
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
think
that
it
is
conceivable
that
it
ultimately
could
at
some
time
in
the
future.
pardon?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
likely
or
not.
it
certainly
is
conceivable.
the
act
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
i
am
not
an
expert
on
--
i
do
not
know
what
the
statistical
information
is.
thank
you.
