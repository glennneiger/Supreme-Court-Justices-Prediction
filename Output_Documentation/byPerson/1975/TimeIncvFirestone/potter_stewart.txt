but
you
have
told
us
already
that
mr.
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
(voice

have
not
seen
the
divorce
decree
itself.
justice

stewart
so
my
brother
brennanâ€™s
question
is
where
did
mr.
duncan
get
this
quote?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
he
did
not
do
anything
in
florida
for
the
time
that
time
could
not
have
done
just
reading
that
ap
ticker
in
new
york,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
paid
on
a
piece-work
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
why,
if
they
are
reversing
another
appellate
court,
would
--
do
they
often
do
that
cryptically?
because
there
is
one
thing
when
you
are
affirming,
it
is
something
else
when
you
are
reversing?
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
several
other
words
over
with
(voice

no
check
mark?
