where
did
mr.

get
that
quote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
does
that
mean
that
she
is
guilty

adultery?
that
is
a
finding
that
she
was
guilty
of

when

i
just
want
to
know
mr.
pickering,
are
you
suggesting
that,
that
there
is
anything
in
that
which
imports
a
finding

that
the

what

a

figure
in
the

times
sense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
further
point
ahead
of
the
paragraph
that
mr.
justice
white
referred
to,
careful
examination
and
consideration
of
the
record
discloses
that
the
judgment
of
trial
court
is
correct.
it
should
have
been
affirmed
on
appeal.
does
that
sweep
in
the
ground
that
you
argue
namely
the
failure
of
the
new
york
home
office
of
those
involved
in
the
publication,
particularly
the
failure
to
spot
the
word
adultery
satisfies
the
premise
of
negligence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
supreme
court
did
not
say
anything
about
that,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
your
supreme
court
did
not
rely
on
that
fact,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
not
–
unless
it
is
in
this
actual
paragraph
i
have
just
read
you?
