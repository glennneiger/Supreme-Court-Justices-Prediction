ms.
edna
l.
caruso
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
stress
at
the
very
beginning
that
throughout
the
appellate
process
in
the
case,
time
inc.
has
never
ever
argued
until
today
that
it
is
entitled
to
any
trial.
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
throughout
the
appellate
courts
in
florida
and
the
briefs
that
are
filed
here
today
solely
urge
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
that
does
not
mean
to
say
that
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
the
power
to
decide
that
any
trial
should
be
granted,
but
that
question
has
never
been
argued
by
time
and
has
never
been
briefed.
starting
with
point
one
on
appeal,
that
is
their
argument
that
they
truthfully
reported
a
judicial
decision
and
that
this
was
an
accurate
reflection
of
what
the
divorce
decree
stated
and
we
would
simply
point
out
to
the
court
that
while
the
husband
in
this
case
counterclaimed
for
divorce
on
the
grounds
of
adultery
and
mental
cruelty,
the
divorce
decree
solely
stated
that
the
husband’s
counterclaim
for
divorce
was
granted.
now,
they
are
argue
that
that
allows
them
to
assume
that
it
was
granted
on
all
grounds
and
i
think
we
all
know
that
the
only
thing
it
allows
us
to
assume
is
that
the
judge
found
in
favor
of
the
husband
on
one
of
the
grounds.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
think
the
district
court
of
appeal
did
hold
that.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
think
that
florida
supreme
court
later
overruled
that
and
i
think
very
clearly
that
the
document
was
not
ambiguous
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes
sir.
i
think
that
any
way
in
regard
to
this,
in
regard
to
whether
the
article
adequately
stated
what
was
in
the
divorce
decree.
in
this
case,
the
jury
was
instructed,
there
can
be
no
recovery
in
this
case
if
you
find
from
the
greater
way
of
the
evidence
that
the
article
as
published
had
no
different
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
reader
than
the
divorce
judgment
and/or
that
the
article
was
substantially
true.
and
of
course,
the
jury
found
in
favor
of
mrs.
firestone,
and
therefore,
they
found
that
the
article
did
have
a
different
effect
on
the
mind
of
the
reader
than
the
divorce
decree
and
if
anything,
we
would
submit
that
this
was
a
question
for
the
jury
and
the
jury
found
against
the
decision
that
my
opponent
is
urging
here
today.
time
inc.
argues
that
there
was
no,
absolutely
no
evidence
of
negligence
in
this
case
on
their
part
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
true.
they
first
argued
that,
of
course,
their
interpretation
was
correct
and
we
submit
that
it
was
not,
they
argued
that
their
editorial
procedure
was
without
fault,
that
there
was
no
negligence.
in
this
case,
we
know
that
time
had
received
three
documents,
dispatches
and
articles
and
also
a
dispatch
from
mr.
delaney
who
was
their
stringer.
the
three
articles
and
dispatches
other
than
delaney’s
did
in
no
way,
we
would
submit,
state
that
the
divorce
was
granted
on
the
grounds
of
adultery.
each
of
those
articles
or
dispatches
stated
that
mrs.
firestone
was
accused
of
adultery
or
her
husband
had
counterclaimed
for
adultery.
they
did
receive
the
dispatch
from
their
stringer
and
he
stated
that
he
had
checked
with
her
attorney
and
that
the
technical
grounds
for
divorce
were
mental
cruelty
and
adultery.
however,
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
evidence
shows
that
even
then,
regardless
of
the
dispatch
from
delaney
that
there
were
serious
doubts
in
time
inc.’s
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
an
accurate
statement
because
there
was
testimony
to
the
effect
that
a
ms.
nadasdy
(ph),
who
was
a
legal
researcher
for
time
was
supposed
to,
after
the
article
was
written,
take
the
article,
and
run
what
they
call
an
accuracy
check
on
the
article.
and
she
was
to
make
a
determination
that
each
and
every
word
was
accurate
and
it
was
supportable.
she
did
not
mark
the
word
adultery.
she
marked
the
other
words
in
the
article,
i
think
with
the
exception
of
a
few,
that
she
did
not
mark
the
word
adultery.
we
think
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
pardon
me.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes,
on
top
of
each
word,
she
made
a
little
mark
and
that
means
that
she
had
checked
it
out
and
it
was
her
determination
that
that
word
was
accurate.
now,
we
think
that
this
testimony
clearly
indicates
that
there
was
a
serious
doubt
in
her
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
sufficient
information
to
support
that
or
whether
or
not
it
has
sufficient
sources
to
support
the
publication
that
mrs.
firestone
had
been
found
guilty
of
adultery.
however,
of
course,
we
know
that
time
went
ahead
and
released
this
publication
stating
that
she
had
been
found
guilty
of
adultery
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
because
the
divorce
decree
was
rendered
on
a
friday
night
about
5:00
and
their
deadline
for
publication
was
saturday
night
at
about
8:00,
so
they
were
pressed
for
time.
we
think
that
that
clearly
indicates
if
not
only
negligence
but
a
reckless
disregard
on
the
part
of
time
inc.
for
going
ahead
in
publishing
the
article
when
the
employees
did
not
even
follow
the
requirement
which
they
admitted,
that
time
inc.
imposed
upon
them
to
follow.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes.
now,
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
make
that
statement.
they
argue
that
they
should
not
be
held
liable
and
cannot
under
the
law
be
held
liable
for
negligence
on
the
part
of
-
cannot
be
held
for
liable
for
negligence
of
their
stringer
in
investigating.
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
here
or
have
not
been
attempting
to
make
time
inc.
account
for
the
negligence
of
their
stringer.
we
are
trying
to
make
them
account
for
the
negligence
of
their
own
employees
for
going
ahead
and
publishing
this
article
when
they
were
serious
out
in
their
mind
that
the
article
was
correct.
these
are
the
acts
of
negligence
that
we
are
attributing
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes
sir.
their
point
too
is
the
argument
that
this
was
a
rational
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
document
and
of
course,
as
you
know,
the
first
argument
in
my
brief
is
that
the
pape
case
is
not
even
applicable
to
this
case.
and
perhaps
for
some
of
the
comments
here,
i
might
see
that
you
do
think
that
it
is
applicable,
but
i
think
that
the
pape
decisions
says
that
when
have
an
ambiguous
document,
and
the
publisher
reads
that
document
and
relies
upon
a
rational
interpretation
of
the
language
in
that
document,
then
there
is
no
malice
as
a
matter
for
law.
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
i
think
that
everybody
has
to
go
and
read
the
document.
that
i
think
that
if
someone
does
not
read
the
document
and
there
is
rational
interpretation
that
they
have
to
be
held
liable.
i
am
just
saying
that
the
pape
case
does
apply
and
i
think
you
are
talking
about
perhaps
common
law,
qualified
privilege
outside
the
pape
case.
however,
if
we
apply
pape
to
this
situation,
i
think
clearly
that
it
does
not
become
a
question
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
clearly
that
it
would
be
a
question
for
a
jury
to
decide
and
in
this
case,
time
inc.
never
asked
for
the
jury
to
be
instructed,
that
if
you
find
that
the
article
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
document
then
there
is
no
malice.
the
only
instruction
they
asked
for
was
an
instruction
to
the
effect
that
you
are
instructed
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
on
that
divorce
decree
is
that
adultery
was
one
of
the
grounds
for
the
divorce.
so
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
they
have
not
properly
in
the
trial
court
--
they
have
not
sufficiently
laid
the
ground
work
to
raise
this
point
on
appeal.
and
then
we
come
to
the
actual
malice
standard
and
they
have
two
arguments.
number
one:
that
rosenbloom
and
cox
broadcasting
have
extended
the
new
york
times
document
to
report
to
judicial
proceedings
and
we
would
first
say
that
we
really
do
not
read
those
cases
is
doing
that.
i
think
the
cox
broadcasting
case
says
essentially
that
truth
is
the
defense.
that
if
you
truthfully
report
a
judicial
proceeding
or
judicial
report
then
it
is
a
defense
and
i
think
that
we
have
shown
in
this
case
that
their
publication
was
not
truthful.
the
second
question
and
perhaps
one
of
the
most
relevant
here
is
whether
or
not
mrs.
firestone
was
a
public
figure,
and
therefore,
whether
or
not
the
standard
of
actual
malice
was
applicable.
of
course
how
you
to
determine
this,
and
we
are
going
to
have
to
look
to
the
various
decisions
of
this
court,
to
the
language
in
those
decisions
and
i
think
perhaps
the
one
that
comes
most
to
mind
is
gertz
because
there,
i
think
it
was
talked
about
perhaps
one
of
the
other
decisions
and
some
of
the
language
is
a
public
figure
is
one
who
has
voluntarily
placed
himself
in
the
public
spotlight
by
reason
of
notoriety
of
their
achievements
or
the
vigor
and
success
for
which
they
seek
the
public’s
attention,
that
they
become
labeled
as
public
figures.
they
thrust
themselves
to
the
forefront
of
public
controversies
in
order
to
influence
the
resolution
of
those
issues.
they
invite
attention
and
comment.
they
voluntarily
expose
themselves
to
the
increased
risk
of
injury
from
defamation.
i
think
that
is
generally
the
language
in
gertz.
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
although
mrs.
firestone
did
file
a
complaint
in
this
case
for
separate
maintenance,
unconnected
with
divorce.
she
did
not
file
for
divorce.
her
husband,
of
course,
counterclaimed
against
her
for
divorce.
she
did
not
institute
the
divorce
proceeding.
therefore,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
she
was
involuntarily
drawn
into
divorce
proceeding.
we
can
only
say
that
simply
because
the
newspapers
chose
to
write
about
mrs.
firestone
and
to
write
about
her
divorce
does
not
make
her
a
public
figure.
she
was
married
to
a
wealthy
man
and
we
certainly
admit
that.
he
was
a
very
wealthy
man,
but
the
woman
was
a
housewife
and
he
sued
for
divorce.
we
think
that
up
to
that
time
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
well,
i
do
not
know,
i
am
sorry.
i
do
not
mean
to
--
perhaps
i
should
not
say
she
was
a
housewife
in
that
sense.
i
do
not
think
that
she
was
a
public
figure
in
her
own
right.
she
was
simply
married
to
a
very
wealthy
man.
i
do
not
know
what
chores
she
performed
around
the
house,
sir.
i
think
that
under
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
well,
i
think
that
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes
sir.
we
were
through
the
claim
for
lost
of
reputation.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
do
not
think
so.
no
sir.
i
will
tell
you
quite
frankly
why
that
was
done.
this
woman
had
just
been
through
a
very
lengthy
divorce
suit
and
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
not
thought
that
she
could
withstand
having
the
witnesses
that
were
paraded
through
the
divorce
suit
and
i
am
talking
about
on
both
sides,
i
am
not
pointing
simply
to
her
husband,
but
we
all
know
from
the
record
that
there
were
many,
many
witnesses
that
came
into
testify
as
to
activities
outside
the
marriage
on
both
parties
and
for
a
number
of
physical
and
emotional
reasons,
it
was
thought
that
the
woman
should
not
have
to
go
through
this
again
and
did
not
want
to
have
to
go
through
this
again.
so
that
is
why
they
withdrew
the
claim
for
lost
of
reputation.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
think
there
is
a
basis
for
recovery
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
no,
i
think
it
was
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
no
sir.
i
think
that
under
defamation
action
we
clearly
do
not
have
to
seek
each
of
the
elements
that
can
be
sought.
for
example
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
mental
anguish,
humiliation.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
think
so
and
i
think
that
the
language
in
gertz
to
me
--
it
says
that.
gertz
says,
okay
that
from
now
on
if
you
have
a
private
individual
and
they
proved
actual
damages
--
okay,
if
they
prove
actual
damages
that
you
can
prove
negligence
or
you
can
prove
other
than
malice
and
the
court
says
their
actual
injury
is
not
limited
to
out-of-pocket
laws.
indeed,
the
more
customary
types
of
actual
harm
inflicted
by
defamatory
falsehoods,
include
impairment
of
reputation
and
standing
in
the
community.
it
goes
on
to
say
personal
humiliation
and
mental
anguish
and
suffering
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
talking
about
the
jury
should
be
correctly
instructed
on
these
elements
of
damages.
and
it
is
our
point
that
we
would
not
have
to
pursue
as
an
element
of
damage
of
the
lost
reputation.
that
we
could
pursue
the
other
elements
lost
of
--
the
other
elements
of
injury
to
this
woman.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
in
proof
of
her
damages,
sir?
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
think
that
it
precluded
either
party
putting
on
evidence
going
to
her
reputation,
yes
sir
and
that
was
what
we
are
trying
to
prevent
because
of
the
lengthy
trial
before
that
where
all
of
this
have
been
brought
out.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
think
they
applied
gertz.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
would
--
quite
frankly,
i
would
have
to
re-look
at
the
decision,
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
if
i
may
have
just
one
second.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
that
is
all
right.
appendix
c.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
i
do
not
frankly
recall
the
specific
things
pointed
to
in
the
florida
supreme
court’s
decision.
unfortunately,
we
had
a
number
of
decisions
in
florida
courts
on
this.
however,
i
think
that
clearly
that
the
evidence
presented
in
this
case
supports
the
finding
of
negligence
on
their
part
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
well,
yes
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
will
also
say
that
i
think
a
reading
of
the
divorce
decree
would
not
allow
one
to
assume
that
it
had
been
on
adultery
and
that
would
be
negligence,
yes
sir.
that
also
i
think
the
important
part
about
time
inc.’s
employees
not
even
following
their
own
standard
to
make
sure
that
they
are
accurately
reporting
something
when
the
employees
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
no
sir.
i
do
no
think
so,
because
in
this
case
see
--
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
in
this
case
i
think
the
distinction
is
that
in
this
case
we
have
the
woman
who
is
responsible
for
running
an
accuracy
check.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
i
do
not
that
was
mentioned
in
there,
no
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
they
specifically
pointed
that
out,
no
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes.
yes
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
yes,
sometimes
it
is
sir.
yes
sir.
ms.
edna
l.
caruso
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
so.
if
there
are
