justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
quoting
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
concede
that
the
article
was
inaccurate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
she
was
granted
--
that
her
husband
was
granted
a
divorce
on
grounds
of
adultery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
what
his
employment
background
--
what
he
did
for
a
regular
living?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
typically,
in
a
pleading,
you
may
seek
a
formal
relief
and
urge
ten
different
reasons
for
and
the
fact
that
the
court
grants
your
prayer
does
not
mean
that
it
is
affirming
all
ten
grounds
that
you
sought.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
found
--
the
supreme
court
of
florida
found
otherwise.
so,
you
may
have
proved
to
us
as
a
constitutional
fact
that
the
thing
was
accurate,
but
surely
you
cannot
rely
on
the
language
of
an
inferior
florida
court
to
supersede
the
language
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
what
we
are
trying
to
get
at
right
now
and
i
am
asking
you
questions
and
hoping
to
get
answers
from
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
least
you
could
say
that
the
decree
said
that,
and
it
does
not
say
what
time
said
it
said?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
get
to
those,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
your
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun.
is
there
any
reason
why
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
florida
cannot
provide
for
fact
finding
on
the
issue
of
negligence
by
its
appellate
court
rather
than
having
to
submit
it
all
to
a
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
this
record
to
support
a
finding
of
negligence
by
someone,
then
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
adequate
for
constitutional
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
walker
case
we
--
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
malice.
here
you
would
be
using
the
same
finding
to
urge
it,
including
there
was
no
negligence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
is
not
the
same
standard
surely.
i
mean,
that
will
be
--
less
evidence
will
support
a
finding
of
negligence,
it
would
support
a
finding
of
malice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
actually
what
the
stringer
said
was
a
lot
more
accurate
than
what
time
said,
was
it
not?
the
stringer’s
dispatch
i
think
is
hard
to
fault.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was
reading
duncan
i
see
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
duncan
is
completely
accurate
as
i
see
it,
but
he
is
not
the
stringer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
consequences
under
florida
law
as
to
what
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
when
she
abandoned
her
claim
for
damage
to
reputation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
but
i
mean,
by
abandoning
her
claim
for
damage
to
reputation,
did
she
preclude
the
use
of
certain
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant?
you
know,
that
even
if
she
had
not
been
granted
a
divorce
for
adultery
or
he
had
been,
he
should
have
been?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
occasion
on
more
than
one
appeal
to
simply
summarily
say
there
is
sufficient
evidence
of
negligence
and
we
disallow
that
point
without
going
into
great
detail
as
to
why
they
think
there
is
sufficient
evidence
of
negligence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
there
is
nothing
that
federal
constitution
would
prevent
them
from
doing
it
anyway?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
you
are
talking
about
a
malice
standard.
that
would
not
necessarily
carryover
to
a
negligence
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
petitioner
is
a
publisher
of
the
time
magazine.
that
magazine
published
an
article
which
purported
to
describe
respondent’s
divorce
from
her
husband,
a
member
of
one
of
america’s
wealthy
or
industrial
family.
respondent,
claiming
the
article
was
both
false
and
defamatory,
brought
a
liable
action
in
a
florida
court.
the
jury
awarded
her
damages
in
the
amount
of
a
$100,000
and
this
judgment
was
ultimately
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
petitioner’s
contentions
that
this
decision
infringed
its
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
for
the
reasons
expressed
in
an
opinion
which
has
been
filed
with
a
clerk
this
morning,
we
reject
petitioner’s
arguments
that
it
was
entitled
for
the
protection
of
the
standard
announced
by
the
court
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
we
conclude
respondent
was
not
a
public
figure
within
the
meaning
of
our
decisions
and
we
disagree
with
petitioner’s
claim
that
the
new
york
times
privilege
should
automatically
extend
to
articles
which
are
reports
of
judicial
proceedings.
we
hold
instead
that
the
proper
standard
of
constitutional
protection
to
be
applied
in
this
case
is
the
one
we
announced
two
terms
ago
in
gertz
versus
robert
welch.
our
review
of
the
record
is
satisfied
as
the
two
of
the
elements
required
by
gertz.
first
that
the
published
report
be
false
and
that
the
damages
be
supported
by
competent
evidence
have
been
met.
as
to
gertz’s
third
requirement
however,
it
appears
that
there
has
never
been
a
finding
by
another
state
courts
which
have
considered
this
case
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
was
at
fault
in
preparing
and
publishing
its
report
of
the
respondent’s
divorce.
we
therefore
remand
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
order
that
this
essential
element
maybe
considered
and
resolved
in
the
state
court.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
has
joined.
separate
dissenting
opinions
have
been
filed
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
