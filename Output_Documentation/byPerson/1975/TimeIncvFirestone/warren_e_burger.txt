we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-944,
time
incorporated
against

mr.
pickering,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
on
mr.
pickering,
i
noticed
in
your
brief
you
follow
that
with
the
reference
to
the
associated
press
dispatch
that
came
apparently
after
the
time
magazine
was
at
least
in
the
sequence
indicate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
deal
with
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
right
there,
mr.
pickering,
do
you
say
that
the
associated
press
dispatch
tells
the
reader
the
same
thing
that
the
time
magazine
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

how
does
an
ordinary
reader
read
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
an
ordinary
reader
read
it
in
any
other
way,
that
is
what
(voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
whether
he
read
the
miami
herald
of
december
16
which
--
in
which
the
article
itself
said
this,
“the
judge
added
that
he
discounted
much
of
the
testimony
in
the
case
as
unreliable.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice

be
here
then,
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
she
a
public
figure
before
she
brought
the
lawsuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
public
figure
in
the
sense
that
it
has
been
used
in
opinions
of
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
what
is
the
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
that
theory,
a
publisher
is
never
liable
for
the
negligence
of
his
servants
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
stringer
had
not
read
the
miami
herald
account
in
which
the
judge
--
the
article
itself
pointed
out
that
the
judge
said
the
testimony
on
the
subject
was
unreliable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
not
put
the
reader
on
notice
that
he
better
check
and
see
what
the
judge
might
have
relied
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
not
what
the
attorney
said,
is
not
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pickering,
in
order
for
you
to
make
your
plans,
you
may
have
observed
we
have
taken
a
little
bit
of
your
time,
we
will
enlarge
the
time
of
your
friend
and
we
will
allow
you
three
minutes
--
make
that
four
minutes
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
will
be
enlarged
correspondingly.
you
may
precede,
ms.
caruso.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
saying
the
supreme
court’s
in
its
opinion,
the
position
has
superseded
all
the
24,
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
are
taking
the
position
of
that
that
in
any
event,
of
course,
the
determination
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
time
magazine
in
new
york
as
distinguished
from
its
stringer
in
florida?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
converse
of
that
would
be
that
a
very
thick-skinned
person
might
suffer
no
mental
anguish,
but
merely
have
a
sense
of
anger,
but
have
his
reputation
in
general
damaged,
thus
separating
these
two
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
ms.
caruso.
you
wish
to
make
any
further,
mr.
pickering?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
started
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question
that
you
could
handle
briefly.
this
testimony
on
page
200
and
has
just
been
alluded
to
indirectly,
that
is
the
researcher
explained
her
function
as
checking
every
word
in
the
story
if
it
was
a
keyword
and
the
record
showed
that
when
she
--
the
document
was
in
evidence.
the
pencil-check
appeared
on
above
each
the
keywords
in
the
article,
the
pencil-check
of
the
researcher,
except
the
word
adultery
and
do
you
suppose
that
testimony
was
overlooked
by
the
jury?
i
am
speaking
of
the
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
but
by
the
jury
in
coming
to
its
conclusions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
her
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
having
already
testified
that
her
regular
habit
was
to
put
a
check
over
every
word
that
she
had
checked
and
then
the
document
was
put
before
the
jury
and
did
not
have
a
check
over
adultery,
do
you
think
that
would
permit
the
jury
to
accept
the
documentary
evidence
rather
than
her
explanation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
there
any
keywords
in
these
definitions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
only
one
keyword
in
this
litigation
and
that
the
word

thank
you
mr.
pickering.
thank
you
ms.

the
case
is
submitted.

justice

judgment
and
