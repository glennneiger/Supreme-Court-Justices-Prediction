justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
respect,
mr.
pickering,
was
this
jury
instructed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that,
there
is
no
instruction
to
this
jury
on
the
issue
of
fault?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
was
it
your
position
that
if
there
is
a
lack
in
this
record
of
an
instruction
on
fault
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
new
trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
obviously
i
am
speaking
of
the
gertz
case
which
came
along
afterward
and
have
you
abandoned
any
position
that
you
are
protected
in
part
by
the
thesis
of
gertz?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
whether
you
feel
you
are
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
fault?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
an
instruction
of
a
kind
to
which
i
referred?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
whether
you
take
this
at
least
now
as
a
secondary
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
might
lose
your
primary
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
i
think
you
go
beyond
that,
do
you
not
mr.
pickering?
you
say
in
any
event,
the
negligence
of
carelessness
standard
is
not
the
proper
one,
that
she
is
a
public
figure,
and
therefore,
the
standard
that
had
to
be
applied
was
new
york
times
(voice
overlap).
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
your
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
other
than
the
journalism
profession
itself
made
her
such.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
received
nationwide
notoriety
because
the
media
itself
gave
her
that
notoriety?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
oh!
by
becoming
president
of
the
united
states,
the
united
states
senator,
maybe.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
i
guess
she
is
not
a
public
figure
in
the
sense
that
general
walker
was?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
she
is
not
in
the
sense
that,
what
was
his
name,
rosen
--
you
know,
the
metromedia
case
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
was
(inaudible)
in
a
police
campaign
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
only
because,
only
i
gather
from
what
you
said,
only
because
this
was
a
sensational
divorce,
involving
people
of
wealth
(voice
overlap).
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
wonder
if
this
is
in
queue
to
whether
or
not
you
succeed
or
fail
here
because
if
she
has
not
a
public
figure,
if
indeed
she
is
a
private
person
in
the
sense
of
gertz,
then
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
the
supreme
court
of
florida
have
the
option
to
adopt
the
timesâ€™
malice
test
on
the
gertz
or
the
--
and
they
have
apparently
adopted
negligence
and
all
that
is
left
in
your
case
is
whether
or
not
we
agree
with
you
that
(voice
overlap).
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
was
it
injury
to
damages
for
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
can
you
separate
really
mental
anguish
and
impingement
upon
reputation?well,
i
am
not
sure
if
i
can
answer
that
specifically
let
me
see
if
i
can
do
it
this
way.
in
this
trial
there
was
testimony
--
for
example,
just
by
mrs.
firestone,
that
she
had
a
little
son
and
that
she
lived
everyday
with
the
thought
that
he
was
going
to
old
enough
to
read
about
this
and
find
out
about
it
and
that
was
something
she
lived
with
and
feared
everyday
of
her
life.
now,
the
judge
in
this
case
ruled
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
reputation.
that
that
had
something
to
do
with
the
mental
state
of
that
woman
and
being
extremely
distressed
over
that
and
so
i
think
that
you
can
separate
and
if
i
may,
what
if
a
person
does
not
have
a
reputation
and
what
if
you
have
someone
who
is
not
known
by
--
that
he
is
a
hermit
or
something
and
no
one
knows
this
man
and
he
does
not
have
a
reputation
or
standing
in
the
community
and
yet
he
is
--
someone
libels
him,
certainly
the
man
for
his
own
mental
pain
and
anguish,
over
what
he
has
withstood
