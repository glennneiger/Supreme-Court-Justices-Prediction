mr.
john
h.
pickering
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
review
decisions
of
that
court,
upholding
$100,000.00
libel
judgment
against
the
petitioner
time
incorporated
and
rejecting

claims
to
the
protection
of
the
guarantees
or
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
the
speech
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
article
in
suit
is
a
short
one,
reporting
the
facts
of
the
divorce
of
the
respondent,
mary
alice
firestone
by
her
husband
russell
firestone.
it
appeared
in
the
milestone
section
of
time
magazine,
a
section
which
is
used
to
record
events
in
the
lives
of
important
people.
the
article
reads
in
its
entirety
as
follows
and
i
quote,
“divorced.”
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
am
quoting
mr.
justice
rehnquist
from
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief.
the
article
also
is
plaintiff’s
exhibit
1
in
the
ten
record
at
page
522.
i
am
quoting
from
my
brief.
“divorced,”
by
russell
a.
firestone
jr.,
41,
heir
to
the
tire
fortune,
mary
alice
sullivan-firestone,
32,
his
third
wife,
a
onetime
palm
beach
schoolteacher,
on
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery,
after
six
years
of
marriage,
one
son,
in
west
palm
beach,
florida.
the
17-month
intermittent
trial
produced
enough
testimony
of
extramarital
adventures
on
both
sides,
said
the
judge
‘to
make
dr.
freud’s
hair
curl.’
that
brief
report
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no
your
honor.
i
am
just
--
i
am
coming
to
that.
the
article
published
in
time
magazine
was
based
on
four
items
and
the
first
item
on
which
it
was
based
is
the
associated
press
dispatch
to
which
you
refer,
which
is
quoted
in
my
brief.
let
me
come
quick
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
will
deal
with
those
right
now,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
i
do
not
sir.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
on
--
from
the
language
of
the
decree
itself
which
i
will
come
to.
that
is
one
of
our
six
points.
this
was
a
truthful
report
of
a
judicial
decision
and
as
such
is
protected
under
cox
broadcasting,
your
honor.
that
is
not
essential
to
our
position,
it
is
one
of
six
points,
any
one
of
which
we
say
we
prevail
on,
but
it
is
one
and
i
do
not
concede
that
it
is
inaccurate.
i
will
come
to
that
in
due
course.
let
me
say
why
it
is
not
inaccurate
or
set
the
stage
as
to
why
it
is
inaccurate
by
stating
that
this
dispatch,
this
item
was
based
on
an
associated
press
dispatch.
mr.
chief
justice
referred
to
an
article
on
the
new
york
daily
news
and
two
dispatches
from
times
miami
office.
now,
the
firestone
divorce
decree
was
handed
down
the
late
afternoon
of
a
friday,
december
15,
1967
in
palm
beach
county,
florida.
within
two
hours
after
that,
time
received
this
associated
press
dispatch
in
it
is
new
york
office.
that
dispatch
stated
that
russell
firestone
had
been
granted
a
divorce
from
the
respondent
here,
whom
he
had
accused
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery
and
the
dispatch
also
described
the
judge’s
statement
about
some
of
the
testimony
of
extramarital
affairs
being
of
the
nature
which
would
make
dr.
freud's
hair
curl.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not,
your
honor
and
not
become
onto
that.
the
new
york
daily
news
article
was
the
next
in
the
progression.
that
was
received
in
the
early
evening
of
friday,
december
15
by
time
and
that
item
is
defendant’s
exhibit
3
in
the
record
at
page
545.
that
item
reported
also
that
russell
had
been
granted
a
divorce
from
his
wife
who
--
but
that
said
simply
that
he
had
accused
her
of
adultery.
no
reference
to
extreme
cruelty,
said
accused
of
adultery
and
it
again
referred
to
the
testimony
about
extramarital
affairs.
at
that
point,
time
decided
to
run
a
piece
on
this
and
it
has
sent
a
query
to
its
miami
bureau
asking
for
further
details,
including
the
grounds
for
the
divorce
in
the
words
of
the
judge.
two
responses
were
received
to
that
query.
the
first
came
from
the
head
of
times
miami
bureau,
mr.
duncan,
stating,
i
am
giving
some
of
the
details
requested
and
stating
that
news
would
follow.
that
was
received
saturday
morning,
december
16.
the
second
dispatch,
received
in
response
to
that
query,
was
from
a
palm
beach
stringer
for
time,
one
delaney
ph).
that
dispatch
received
nearly
afternoon
of
saturday,
december
16,
said,
that
is
plaintiff’s
exhibit
4
in
the
record,
it
appears
in
the
tan
copy
at
page
532,
that
stated
that
the
technical
grounds
of
divorce,
according
to
joseph
farrish,
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
mrs.
firestone
“were
given
as
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery.”
so
time
then
had
from
its
stringer
a
statement
as
to
--
from
the
attorney
for
the
mrs.
firestone
what
the
grounds
of
divorce
were?
with
those
four
items,
the
ap
dispatch,
the
new
york
daily
news
article,
and
the
two
responses
to
its
query,
to
its
miami
bureau.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
time
did
not
have
at
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
subsequently,
subsequently.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
--
it
was
a
saturday.
the
deadline
for
that
edition
of
time
magazine
was
that
saturday
night.
it
--
the
decree
had
come
down
about
5
o’clock
on
a
friday.
time
was
satisfied
and
i
submit
with
the
findings
that
were
made
below
that
time
was
--
there
was
no
actual
malice
on
its
part
that
it
took,
followed
a
careful
editorial
process,
it
took
the
reasonable
precaution.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
what?
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
divorce
decree
itself
as
report
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
not
commented.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
right.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
came
from,
i
believe
the
associated
press
dispatch
and
it
is
an
exact
quote
from
the
language
of
the
divorce
decree
itself
which
is
plaintiff’s
exhibit
2
and
appears
in
the
record
at
page
523.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
time
did
not
have.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
quote,
as
far
as
i
know,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
came
from
the
associated
press
dispatch.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct.
now,
delaney,
the
stringer,
did
contact
judge
knot,
the
divorce
judge,
he
contacted
him
late
saturday
afternoon
and
verified
a
couple
of
quotes
which
time
--
which
they
had
had
from
the
divorce
decree,
but
the
testimony
was
that
he
did
not
ask
nor
did
the
judge
tell
him
what
the
grounds
for
divorce
have
been.
delaney
was
satisfied
and
we
submit
properly
so
he
had
from
mr.
farrish.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
record
does
not
establish
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
what?
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
although
i
cannot
be
categorically
certain.
it
was
some
time
and
i
think
that
is
all
the
record
shows
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
it
was
sometime
after
the
article
--
long
after
the
article
perhaps
that
they
got
a
copy
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no.
i
do
not
think
it
is.
you
can
check
with
the
attorneys.
you
have
the
attorney
for
one
of
the
parties
saying
that
in
her
what
the
technical
grounds
were.
you
had
the
ap
dispatch
which
stated
that
a
divorce
has
been
granted
that
the
wife
had
been
accused
on
two
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery.
and
you
had
a
wire
coming
from
the
stringer
saying
that
the
attorney
said
so
much.
now,
let
me
try
to
say
that
there
should
not
be
a
rule
that
makes
the
difference
in
constitutional
liability,
depending
on
whether
or
not
you
have
seen
a
copy
of
an
appendix
if
in
fact
you
have
reported
that
opinion
correctly.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
what
i
say
is
that
that
is
a
reasonable,
that
is
an
accurate,
fairly
and
accurately
reports
what
the
divorce
decree
says.
the
time
does
not
say
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
exactly.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
in
the
first
place,
the
article
does
not
say
mr.
justice
that
she
was
found
guilty
of
adultery.
this
is
maybe
semantics,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
be
absolutely
precise.
the
article
itself
says
that
she
was
divorced
on
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery.
now,
the
final
judgment
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
what?
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
i
say
it
is
a
matter
of
semantics
but
i
wanted
to
be
absolutely
precise.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
stringer
said
the
technical
grounds
for
divorce.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct.
now
alright
let
us
--
let
us
look
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
let
us
look
at
the
final
judgment.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
--
page
526.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
stringer
is
the
usual
stringer
relationship,
your
honor
of
someone
who
was
available
to
do
hourly
--
work
on
an
hourly
basis
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
paid
on
a
piece-work
basis.
he
was
not
an
official
part
of
the
time
organization,
but
has
been
used
as
a
stringer
for
various
items.
he
had
been
in
the
palm
beach
area,
and
therefore,
he
checked
this
out.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes.
it
is
set
forth
--
he
had
been
a
reporter
in
the
palm
beach
area,
been
a
news
broadcaster
and
his
present
job
at
that
time
was
as
a
news
commentator
and
as
part-time.
but
he
had
been
in
journalism
one
sort
and
another
for
over
20
years,
your
honor.
that
appears
at
beginning
on
the
record,
page
346.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no.
the
record
i
do
not
believe
shows
that.
the
associated
press
dispatch
which
was
the
thing
that
triggered
the
time
interest
in
that
also
contain
that
same
statement
about
being
discounted.
but,
let
me
say,
why
this
is
an
accurate
report
of
what
the
judicial
decree
said.
page
523
of
the
record
is
where
the
final
judgment,
the
divorce
decree
begins.
in
the
first
paragraph
it
says,
and
i
will
skip
the
immaterial
parts,
the
cause
came
on
for
final
hearing
before
the
court
upon
the
wife’s
second
amended
complaint,
etcetera.
the
defendant
--
the
defendant
husband’s
answer
and
counterclaim
for
divorce
on
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery,
so
the
husband
counterclaim
for
divorce
on
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery.”
the
decree
goes
on
at
the
bottom
of
page
523
to
refer
to
certain
testimony
about
the
extramarital
escapades
of
the
plaintiff
such
a
natures
would
made
dr.
freud’s
hair
curl,
states
that
the
court
is
inclined
to
discount
much
of
this
as
unreliable
nevertheless,
it
is
a
conclusion
in
finding
of
neither
party
is
domesticated
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
again
--
that
illustrates
the
difficulty
your
honor
of
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
not
clear,
not
clear.
at
that
moment
exactly,
we
would
say
that
lack
of
domestication
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
in
the
first
place
it
was
not
a
ground
for
divorce
--
statutory
ground
for
divorce
in
florida
at
the
time.
his
counter
--it
recites
the
counterclaim
on
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery
and
make
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
they
refer
that
the
parties
were
not
domesticated
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
but
the
--
the
final
--
you
get
to
the
adjudication
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no.
i
am
not.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
necessarily
comes
from
lack
of
domestication.
i
say
it
could.
i
say
where
that
comes
from
then
is
page
528,
mr.
justice
brennan.
where
the
judge
says
ordered
and
adjudged
as
follows.
one,
that
the
equities
in
this
cause
are
with
the
defendant,
that
defendant’s
counterclaim
for
divorce
be
and
the
same
is
hereby
granted.
what
was
the
counterclaim
for?
it
was
for
a
divorce
on
the
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
--
if
this
is
--
when
the
language
is
this
clear
as
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
found,
it
has
said
that
time
carefully,
fairly,
and
accurately
reported
the
final
decree
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
am
saying
that
that
is
much
closer
to
the
mark,
your
honor,
than
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
in
any
event
it
is
this
court’s
function
to
decide
that
issue
as
a
constitutional
matter.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
my
understanding,
and
again
i
am
not
an
expert
in
florida
law,
it
is
my
understanding
that
alimony
is
not
awardable
and
alimony
was
of
course
awarded
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
--
in
this
case.
lack
of
domestication
also.
suppose
time
had
printed
that
the
divorce
was
granted
on
grounds
of
lack
of
domestication
which
the
is
--
which
is
what
the
respondent
is
saying
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
well,
i
do
not
know.
the
lack
of
domestication
maybe
a
defamatory
statement
to
--
packing
as
it
does
with
this
testimony
and
so
on
of
un-marital
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
well,
i
must
submit
mr.
justice
that
i
think
it
affords
a
basis
for
saying
that
--
precisely
that
because
it
has
said
the
counterclaim
was
granted.
now,
we
say
that
it
was
a
truthful
report.
we
also
say
that
in
--
at
the
worst,
it
is
a
rational
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
document.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
he
could
have
said,
i
would
grant
it
on
grounds
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
open
to
responsible
reporting,
the
complexities
of
reporting,
judicial
decisions,
members
of
this
court
well
know
what
the
problems
are,
that
the
press
faces
in
matters
of
legal
reporting
and
again
i
turn
to
the
report
of
the
decision
of
the
florida
intermediate
court
of
appeals
which
i
think
put
the
knob
of
what
we
are
wrestling
with,
saying
that
if
the
press
were
charged
with
correctly
analyzing
the
legal
intricacies
of
each
news
item,
their
pages
would
remain
empty
of
substance.
now,
i
say
that
time
did
correctly
analyze
the
divorce
decree
on
the
basis
of
what
they
had.
i
further
say
that
time
was
not
guilty
of
fault
or
negligence
and
the
liability
has
been
imposed
here
without
fault.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
only
on
truth,
your
honor.
all
that
went
to
the
jury
was
the
issue
of
truth.
the
instructions
appear
at
585
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
h.
pickering
on
the
issue
of
fault,
that
is
correct.
also
it
went
to
the
jury
with
instructions
that
if
they
found
time
was
guilty
of
malice,
they
could
impose
punitive
damages.
they
awarded
compensatory
damages,
but
refused
to
find
punitive
damages.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no.
our
position
is,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
law
that
time
--
that
the
malice
standard
should
apply
here
and
also
alternatively
all
of
these
are
alternative
arguments,
let
me
just
outline
very
briefly,
what
our
legal
points
are
that
there
was
no
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
by
the
which?
by
the
theses
of
gertz?
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
we
take
the
position
that
there
was
liability
--
liability
was
imposed
without
fault
for
three
reasons.
one,
the
time
truthfully
reported
and
were
protected
by
cox
broadcasting.
second,
that
was
no
error
of
fault.
nothing
was
found
below.
no
fault
of
any
kind.
it
was
not
submitted
on
negligence.
the
florida
supreme
court’s
characterization
of
the
article
as
an
example
of
journalistic
negligence
rested
simply
on
its
statement
that
mrs.
firestone
was
not
divorced
on
grounds
of
adultery.
we
say
that
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
we
submit
that
the
editorial
process
disclosed
by
this
record
set
--
discussed
in
our
brief
and
commented
on
by
the
district
court
of
appeal
precludes
finding
time
liable
as
a
matter
of
law
in
this
case.
we
have
our
fault
arguments
the
last
of
which
is
that
this
was
a
rational
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
document.
the
document,
the
ambiguities
that
are
in
it
have
already
been
pointed
out,
lack
of
domestication,
what
the
grounds
were,
and
the
simple
granting
of
the
counterclaim.
those
are
our
three
under
know
--
the
lack
of
any
fault.
our
other
arguments
are
that
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
if
we
would
have
to
have
a
trial,
yes.
we
raised
all
of
this.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes.
i
would
take
that
as
a
secondary
position,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
exactly
and
i
have
three
more
primary
ones
before
i
am
driven
back
to
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
as
long
as
they
properly
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
there
was
or
was
not
negligence.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
subject
of
course
to
the
independent
review
of
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes,
and
we
say
for
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes,
that
is
our
additional
one.
we
first
say
there
was
no
fault
for
three
reasons,
which
i
have
touched
on.
we
also
say
that
and
as
i
have
said
there
was
no
finding
of
negligence
below
except
for
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
it
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
on
any
negligence
theory.
and
we
say
that
in
addition
to
negligence,
an
actual
malice
standard
should
apply
for
three
reasons.
one,
that
this
is
a
report
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
now,
our
starting
point
for
all
of
this
is
the
long
recognition
this
court
has
given
to
the
important
function
of
the
press
and
reporting
on
public
proceedings
in
the
judicial
forum
and
the
need
to
be
protected
in
order
to
perform
that
function.
and
if
in
reporting
a
matter
of
this
kind,
we
do
not
come
within
the
truthful
protection
of
cox
broadcasting,
we
say
that
there
should
be
and
here
we
would
rely
more
strongly
on
mr.
justice
white’s
concurring
views
in
the
metromedia
case
that
the
actual
malice
standard
should
apply
to
reports
of
public
proceedings.
we
say,
and
that
is
particularly
true,
in
the
case
of
the
litigants
themselves
in
that
proceeding.
that
they
can
be
decided
to
be
public
figures
for
the
purpose
of
the
new
york
times
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
two
things
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
she
began
this
litigation.
it
was
a
sensational
piece
of
a
divorce
proceeding
that
has
spanned
almost
two
years,
received
nationwide
notoriety.
mr.
firestone
was
a
very
prominent
wealthy
individual
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct.
but
how
does
one
become
a
public
figure
other
than
coming
to
the
attention
of
the
press
in
some
way?
mr.
john
h.
pickering
then
it
becomes
a
public
official,
your
honor.
yes.
but
the
gertz
test,
we
submit
is
satisfied
here
for
determining
who
is
a
public
figure.
she
has
started
this.
it
received
national
publicity
and
we
say
that
a
rule
to
protect
the
press
is
required
here
where
the
--
in
order
to
report
on
judicial
proceedings
we
think
it
is
a
nice
narrow
manageable
--
it
is
not
the
broad
public
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct.
she
is
not
for
all
purposes
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
metro,
well
metro
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
but
she
is
a
public
figure,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
considerable
social
wealth
--
social
prominence
and
wealth.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes.
she
was
a
prominent
member
of
palm
beach
society
as
a
wife
of
russell
firestone.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
not
for
all
purposes
and
for
all
things.
we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
say
that
she
is
a
public
figure
in
the
purposes
and
for
the
context
of
this
case
and
that
there
is
a
concurrence
of
the
interest
in
protecting
the
press
and
reporting
on
judicial
proceedings
so
far
as
the
litigants
themselves
are
concerned.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
in
the
sense
of
gertz,
then
the
negligence
standard
would
apply.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
whether
we
agree
that
we
were
not
negligent.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
one
additional
malice
point
however
and
that
is
mrs.
firestone
was
allowed
to
waive
at
the
eve
of
trial
withdraw
her
claim
for
damage
to
reputation.
we
say
that
really
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
libel
case
at
that
time
and
we
so
urge.
we
rely
here
on
the
gertz’s
case
itself
for
saying
that
there
must
be
proof
of
actual
damage
as
a
constitutional
matter,
the
protected
interest
is
reputation
itself
and
having
withdrawn
that
claim,
she
should
not
be
allowed
to
press
and
that
the
actual
malice
rather
that
the
actual
malice
test
should
then
apply
because
you
weigh
in
the
scales.
the
first
amendment
rights
and
the
rights
of
the
party
and
when
reputation
is
taken
out
as
an
ingredient
of
injury,
the
scale
we
say
should
come
down
on
the
balance
of
the
preferred
first
amendment
(inaudible)
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
she
waived
it,
took
it
out,
we
have
pointed
out,
we
have
referred
to
a
case
in
our
reply
brief
in
appendix
a,
the
cardillo
case
in
the
second
circuit
which
we
believe
supports
the
idea
that
libel
proof
for
people
who
have
not
claimed
damage
to
reputation
should
not
be
–
stay
in
court
in
view
of
the
first
amendment.
that
is
now
officially
cited
and
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
the
citation,
it
is
518
f2nd
638.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
518,
mr.
chief
justice
and
on
the
matter
of
the
stringer
and
the
statement
that
came
from
him,
we
submit
that
time
was
entitled
to
rely
on
that
stringer
despite
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
a
conflict
between
the
attorney
and
the
stringer
at
trial
over
who
said
what
to
whom.
we
say
that
time
was
just
as
entitled
to
rely
on
that
stringer
as
the
associated
press
was
to
rely
on
its
reporter,
major
general
walker
had
disputed,
but
this
court
had
found
for
the
associated
press
in
the
walker
case.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
constitutional
standard
in
either
event
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
certainly,
your
honor,
and
i
say
if
we
can
establish
malice,
lack
of
actual
malice,
we
should
be
home
free
under
one
branch
of
our
argument.
we
also
submit
that
the
evidence
is
not
sufficient
to
find
negligence
here.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes
sir.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
i
--
here
the
time
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
the
stringer
had
nothing.
the
persons
responsible
for
that
article
mr.
justice,
those
who
are
in
editorial
process
for
the
people
back
in
new
york,
the
writer,
the
researcher
and
the
editor
and
the
knowledge
of
that
stringer
is
not
imputable
to
those
persons.
i
am
very
happy
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
or
to
time
magazine
and
here
i
rely
on
the
situation
of
the
photographer
in
cantrell
against
florida
city
publishing.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
our
argument
on
that
point
and
it
is
spelled
out
in
the
reply
brief
quite
fully.
our
argument
is
that
we
are
relying
on
the
report
of
the
stringer.
we
were
entitled
to
and
we
did
and
that
that
cannot
be
actual
malice
and
certainly
it
cannot
be
negligence
either
in
our
view
and
it
is
not
imputed
back
to
the
people
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
exactly.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
well,
until
it
has
come
home
to
the
people
responsible
for
it,
if
they
knew
of
the
conflict,
your
honor
and
so
on
or
if
the
person
were
a
notorious
--
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
they
had
no
reason
not
to
rely
on
the
stringer.
he
sent
a
straight
cable
into
saying
what
the
technical
grounds
for
divorce
were
according
to
the
respondent’s
attorney.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
not
that
it
was
--
simply
he
was
inclined
to
discount
much
of
it
as
unreliable.
he
did
not
say
it
was
discounting
it
all
and
that
is
another
reason
why
we
were
not
negligent.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
alright,
why
did
they
do?
he
called
up
the
attorney
for
the
offended
party,
mrs.
firestone
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct,
but
that
was
not
reflected
or
that
was
not
known
back
at
times’
home
office
when
they
wrote
the
piece.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes,
well
no.
he
was
simply
the
usual
relationship
of
stringer.
he
was
available
to
be
called
upon
to
do
work
for
time
on
an
hourly
basis.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
hear.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
would
take
the
same
position
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
i
would
take
the
same
position,
your
honor,
if
it
were
the
head
of
the
miami
bureau
as
long
as
there
was
nothing
to
put
times’
office
back
in
new
york
on
notice
that
something
was
wrong
with
that.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
he
had
been
in
news
work
for
a
number
of
years.
his
testimony
appears
beginning
at
page
346,
it
says,
a
stringer
is
usually
someone
who
is
employed
full
time
elsewhere
and
works
in
a
part-time
capacity
for
time
magazine.
he
says,
i
work
part-time,
not
on
any
guaranteed
salary?
no.
his
entire
background
is
gone
into
and
this
--
if
a
--
the
person
is
responsible
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
until
something
comes
to
the
attention
of
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
publication
that
he
is
not
to
be
relied
on,
yes
your
honor.
otherwise
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
oh
no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
the
stringer
is
--
i
would
say
that
the
head
of
the
miami
bureau’s
information
is
not
to
be
imputed
back
to
those
who
were
responsible
for
the
organization
any
more
than
the
stringer.
the
knowledge
really
has
to
be
brought
home
to
the
people
who
are
responsible
for
what
goes
into
the
magazine.
i
am
sure
they
cannot
shut
their
eyes
to
matters.
to
answer
your
precise
question
about
whether
he
had
seen
and
your
question
about
whether
he
had
seen
the
miami
herald,
the
best
answer
i
can
give
there
is
that
he
had
at
least
talked
to
the
associated
press
people
in
checking
this
out
and
they
had
the
same
thing
in
the
associated
press
dispatch
that
the
judge
was
inclined
to
discount.
much
of
this
testimony
is
unreliable.
they
did
not
rule
it
out
and
that
is
one
reason
we
say
that
time
was
not
negligent.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
it
says
the
technical
grounds
for
divorce
were
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery.
that
in
effect
is
what
the
time
article
says
on
grounds
of
extreme
cruelty
and
adultery,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
duncan
says
nothing
about
the
grounds
for
divorce.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct.
no
further
questions.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
yes,
just
a
few
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
no,
your
honor
because
i
think
it
was
made
very
clear
in
the
testimony
that
that
absence
of
a
check
mark
signified
absolutely
nothing.
that
is
what
ms.
nadasdy
testified
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
was
her
testimony.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
possible.
but
the
only
issue
that
went
to
the
jury
your
honor
was
truth.
there
was
nothing
about
negligence
or
malice
or
anything
else.
mrs.
nadasdy
and
the
other
people
responsible
for
the
article,
the
writer
darner
(ph)
and
the
editor
daniels,
all
testified
at
the
trial
as
to
their
complete
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
article
at
the
time
it
was
published
and
at
the
time
of
trial.
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i
can
give
you
the
record
references
for
that
testimony,
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
the
researcher
nadasdy
and
the
editor
both
testified
and
this
is
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
reply
brief
that
the
absence
of
the
check
mark
over
that
signified
nothing.
now,
let
me
come
to
just
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
there
were
several
other
words
your
honor,
there
were
not
a
check
mark
over
(voice
overlap)
and
if
you
will
look
at
plaintiff’s
exhibit
--
mr.
john
h.
pickering
some
other
words,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
there
is
only
one
keyword
as
far
as
her
suit
is
concerned,
but
in
making
an
accurate
statement
to
the
general
public,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
a
number
of
keywords.
now,
let
me
give
one
more
reason
why
any
knowledge
of
the
stringer
delaney
cannot
be
attributed
to
time.
the
new
york
times
case
itself
makes
that
plain
because
there
was
knowledge
and
times
filed
--
the
files
of
the
new
york
times
itself
that
contradicted
the
advertisement,
but
this
court
said
that
did
not
come
to
the
attention
of
those
responsible
to
the
publication.
mr.
john
h.
pickering
that
is
correct.
but
you
can
have
the
lack
of
imputation
for
a
negligence
as
well.
it
is
an
easier
test,
i
grant
you
that
your
honor,
yes.
my
opponent
referred
to
the
failure
of
time
to
request
jury
instructions.
time
requested
jury
instructions.
they
appear
--
the
record
at
557,
558
on
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
which
it
raised
and
that
included
all
of
these.
now,
several
questions
dealt
with
why
was
the
claim
for
reputation
withdrawn
and
did
not
that
do
something
if
i
could
for
just
one
second
respond
to
that.
the
claim
for
damage
to
reputation
was
withdrawn
because
it
was
quite
clear,
we
were
prepared
--
time
was
prepared
to
do
in
proving
this
and
the
danger
that
follows
from
allowing
claim
for
a
representation
to
be
withdrawn
is
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case
because
mrs.
firestone
testified
the
thing
that
concerned
her
most
about
this
article
was
that
someday,
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
said,
someday
her
infant
son
would
hear
about
and
understand
what
it
meant.
that
appears
in
the
record
393
and
the
jury
sent
back
a
query,
in
the
record
on
page
515
to
the
judge
asking
if
they
could
award
compensatory
damages
to
the
son
in
trust
for
him.
the
judge
answered
no
without
consulting
with
the
attorneys.
the
verdict
then
came
in
for
a
$100
000.00
compensatory
damage.
thank
you,
your
honor.
