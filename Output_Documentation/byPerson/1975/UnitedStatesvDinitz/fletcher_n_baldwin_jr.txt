mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
had
the
defendant
found
guilty,
your
honor?
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
and
there
is
no
attorney
present
or
his
chief
trial
counsel
has
been
removed?
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
if
indeed
that
occurred
in
the
instant
case
and
if
the
judge
elected
as
his
option
to
continue
on
with
the
trial
and
to
force
the
only
other
retained
counsel,
mr.
meldon
to
proceed,
then
we
would
have
had
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
question
issue,
right
to
counsel
issue.
we
would
not
at
juncture
had
a
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
question,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
it
is
arguable
that
we
would
have
at
least
have
a
case
on
the
sixth
amendment,
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
i
would
think,
yes,
your
honor
it
was
clearly,
it
struck
at
the
heart
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
in
my
opinion
it
would
have
violated
his
right
to
counsel
and
it
would
appear
that
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
en
banc
court
below,
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
your
honor,
it
would
appear
that
the
heart
of
this
case
involves
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
it
involves
the
sixty
amendment
right
to
counsel
because
the
only
retained
trial
attorney
present
in
this
case
was
the
attorney
that
was
removed.
the
defendant
had
hired
one
other
attorney
not
two.
he
had
hired
one
other
attorney
to
make
sure
that
all
papers
were
filed
until
he
could
retain
an
experience
trial
counsel
and
this
is
the
heart
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion
below.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
focused
in
upon
the
abuse
of
the
trial
process
by
the
judge
below
and
in
focusing
in
on
abuse
of
the
trial
process,
the
fifth
circuit
concluded
that
the
court
below
cut
the
heart
out
of
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
when
that
court
removed
the
only
trial
attorney
available
to
the
defendant
over
the
defendant’s
objection
and
not
only
removed
him
as
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated,
but
had
two
marshals
gingerly
escort
from
the
courtroom,
from
the
grounds
and
left
him
off
in
the
parking
lot
across
the
street.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
that
is
a
common
practice
in
the
fifth
circuit
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
we
requested
oral
arguments
en
banc
and
we
were
denied,
our
motion
was
denied.
the
government
in
this
case
stresses
two
points,
two
major
points
that
i
would
like
in
the
time
that
i
have
to
discuss.
first,
that
the
defendant
with
his
second
retained
counsel,
moving
for
mistrial
or
at
least
the
hobson’s
choice
as
the
court
below
noted,
in
moving
for
mistrial
waived
his
right
to
plead
double
jeopardy
in
the
appellate
court.
and
second,
aside
from
that
and
barring
whether
the
case
involved
a
waiver
or
not
assume
arguendo
it
did
not
involved
the
waiver,
the
doctrine
of
manifest
necessity
or
the
ends
of
public
justice
prevail.
the
two
major
cases
that
the
defendant
would
cite
in
support
of
his
proposition,
aside
from
the
case
that
i
was
given
yesterday
afternoon
which
i
will
discuss
later,
are
tateo
and
illinois
against
somerville
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
in
detail.
in
response
to
his
first
point,
the
government
argues
that
the
mistrial
was
a
direct
result
of
the
defendant’s
motion
and
when
a
motion
by
a
defendant
is
made
for
a
mistrial
that
assumes
to
waive
any
double
jeopardy
claim
that
a
defendant
might
otherwise
have,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
there
might
be
prosecutorial
or
judicial
error.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
question
of
double
jeopardy?
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
was
not
discussed
in
chambers
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
were
trying
to
get
the
attorney
back
into
court.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
although
it
is
not
before
you,
we
did
send
the
judge
a
telegram
that
afternoon
in
which
and
i
telegrammed
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
was
docketed
in
the
fifth
circuit
73-1395
and
the
telegram
stated
both
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
objections
to
the
act.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
that
was
before
the
motion
was
made.
that
was
after
02:40
p.m.
on
the
afternoon
of
february
the
15th
1973.
the
motion
for
mistrial
occurred
10:00
a.m.
february
the
16th
1973.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
it
stated
that
the
judge
had
created
error
and
the
error
would
involve
fifth
and
sixth
amendment,
although
mr.
justice
rehnquist
we
wished
to
concentrate
upon
right
to
counsel
at
that
particular
time
because
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
noted
initially
with
this
hypothetical,
double
jeopardy
was
not
at
issue
at
that
particular
point.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
we
had
double
jeopardy
in
mind.
we
did
not
wish
to
use
double
jeopardy
because
this
was
or
at
least
the
defendant
felt
as
you
can
tell
by
the
record
very
strongly
that
this
was
an
aggressive
trial
attorney
and
please
keep
in
mind
your
honor
that
the
defendant
started
with
a
paid
trial
attorney
and
ended
as
a
popper
with
no
attorney.
the
main
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
motion
made
for
a
mistrial
your
honor,
the
following
day,
we
argue
was
not
a
motion
at
all
because
there
were
no
options
open
to
the
defendant
at
that
particular
point
in
time.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
your
honor,
throughout
the
record,
especially
page
38
of
the
record,
counsel
had
time
and
time
again
requested
the
court
to
reinstate
mr.
wagner.
page
38,
the
court
indicates
that
he
would
not.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
this
is
before
the
motion
for
mistrial.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
mistrial
motion
itself
occurs
at
page
41
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
when
mr.
meldon
requested
the
court
to
move
for
a
mistrial.
it
is
our
contention,
however,
that
by
that
time,
there
was
no
available
option
use
to
the
defendant.
he
could
not
proceed
further
with
his
case.
he
did
not
have
an
attorney
to
proceed
with
the
case.
the
court
at
the
top
of
page
41
said
that
he
would
not
reinstate
mr.
wagner.
he
would
not
let
us
go
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
he
would
not
allow
the
defendant
to
continue
in
formal
purpose
(ph).
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
your
honor
when
the
court
removed
mr.
wagner
from
the
courtroom,
we
tried,
what
we
were
focusing
in
upon
was
how
do
we
get
him
back
in?
and
unless
we
could
walk
him
back
in
and
then
have
him
arrested,
we
could
think
of
no
way
to
get
him
back
in.
we
called
the
fifth
circuit
to
ask
whether
they
knew
how
we
can
him
back
in.
they
said
the
only
way
we
can
think
of
would
be
through
an
interlocutory
appeal
which
they
would
not
take
unless
the
trial
judge
would
join
in,
in
the
alternative
walk
him
back
in
the
court
which
he
would
not
do.
consequently,
we
threw
up
our
hands
and
in
effect
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
more
we
can
do.
the
court
was
proper
at
least
at
that
juncture
in
terms
our
trying
to
have
mr.
wagner
reinstated.
the
whole
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
courts
--
that
is
an
unfortunate
sentence
at
least
the
way
it
came
out.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
other
counsel
felt
that
way.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
my
main
concern
at
the
time
your
honor
and
the
purpose
for
the
statement
was
to
attempt
somehow
to
get
mr.
wagner
in.
i
did
not
know
how
to
do
it.
i
do
not
know
how
to
do
it
today.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
go
back
if
i
may
for
a
moment.
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
as
we
talked
in
the
fifth
circuit
below,
once
the,
if
i
may
use
the
term,
wrath
of
the
trial
judge
focused
upon
mr.
meldon
after
mr.
wagner
had
been
removed
on
page
33
of
the
record,
the
judge
said
mr.
meldon,
in
effect
you
are
going
out
too
unless
you
can
convince
me
that
you
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
i
am
going
to
treat
you
the
same
way
i
have
treated
mr.
wagner
and
although
the
court
uses
the
terms
in
the
minutes
below,
disbarred
mr.
wagner
as
the
government
points
out,
barring
would
have
been
more
proper,
but
the
court
certainly
could
have
disbarred
mr.
meldon.
mr.
meldon
acted
from
here
--
from
the
point
page
33
on,
when
the
focus
shifted
to
mr.
meldon.
he
acted
under
a
cloud,
from
page
33
on
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
he
said
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
if
he
could
disbar
him
if
there
are
circumstances
that
would
support
disbarment.
disbarment,
we
would
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
you
must,
that
is
the
final
resort
contempt
as
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
there
are
other
grounds
for
punishment,
other
ways
to
punish
attorney
short
of
the
drastic
act
of
disbarment.
i
would
also
point
out
in
response
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
that
from
page
33
of
the
record
on
your
honor,
the
defendant,
i
am
sorry,
mr.
meldon
kept
asking
to
be
removed
from
the
case.
yet,
this
will
be
the
same
attorney
that
ultimately
will
move
for
a
mistrial.
he
stated
immediately
that
i
do
not
want
to
proceed,
the
defendant
does
not
want
me
to
proceed.
he
was
at
that
particular
juncture
excess
baggage
as
it
were.
now,
the
government
argues
that
once
--
that
the
trial
court
was
never
placed
on
notice
of
these
other
factors
that
mr.
meldon
did
not
want
to
proceed
that
he
was
not
prepared,
being
the
only
other
hired
counsel
that
he
could
not
proceed,
i
would
point
out
to
you
as
the
decision
on
boxing
to
stress
that
this
is
ongoing
act.
that
it
was
not
necessarily
at
the
point
in
time
at
which
mr.
wagner
was
removed
that
we
focus
or
that
the
court
below
focused.
it
was
the
culminated
in
the
next
morning
in
the
removal
of
the
jury
by
dismissing
that
jury
by
dismissing
that
jury
and
what
was
the
ongoing
act?
first,
it
was
the
removal
of
mr.
wagner,
the
afternoon
of
february
the
15th,
that
would
involve
sixth
amendment
questions.
secondly,
it
was
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
one
even
consider
options
as
far
as
the
removal
was
concerned
which
goes
to
the
heart
of
jorn
simply
a
removal
and
secondly,
when
it
came
ultimately
to
the
court’s
attention
that
mr.
wagner
was
indeed
the
only
trial
counsel
available,
the
court
refuses
to
take
additional
steps
or
any
steps
to
correct
that
initial
error.
now,
although
the
government
says
it
was
unforeseeable,
it
was
quite
foreseeable
because
we
have
a
length
of
time,
at
least
18
hours
in
which
the
court
could
have
considered
alternatives
to
the
drastic
act
of
removing
that
first
jury?
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
although,
the
judge
had
earlier
at
page
40
of
the
record
indicated
that
he
was
thinking
of
moving
or
considering
moving
for
a
mistrial
because
the
ends
of
public
justice,
neither
the
government
nor
the
defendant
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
well,
the
defendant
moved
a
motion
for
mistrial
through
an
attorney
who
was
not
longer
capable
of
representing
the
defendant.
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
court
really
stressed
its
position
by
saying
it
would
not
enter
any
orders
allowing
mr.
wagner
to
return.
it
would
not
consider
curative
alternatives.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
mr.
meldon
said
your
honor
that
he
did
not
want
to
represent
the
defendant
once
mr.
wagner
was
removed.
mr.
meldon
told
the
court
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
he
did
not
prepared
the
opening
statement,
he
did
not
prepare
the
trial
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
he
made
the
motion
for
mistrial
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
a
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
he
argues
that
--
he
does
state
that
he
conferred
with
the
defendant.
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
if
indeed
there
is
a
question
of
a
valued
right
such
as
double
jeopardy
that
the
trial
judge
himself
in
light
of
the
facts
of
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
particular
case
should
himself
had
re-conferred
with
the
defendant
as
to
whether
the
defendant
wished
to
waive
his
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
there
are
lower
court
cases,
your
honor,
but
none
of
this
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
do
have
in
the
brief
lower
court
cases
that
do
suggest
and
hold
that.
but
the
heart
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
important
for
me
to
stress
the
fact
that
the
error
in
the
instant
case
could
have
been
cured
at
anytime
prior
to
the
dismissal.
the
failure
of
the
trial
judge
to
cure
that
error,
the
en
banc
decision
states,
was
the
culmination
of
an
abuse
of
judicial
discretion.
the
abuse
of
judicial
discretion
was
the
combination
of
the
removal
of
the
trial
counsel,
coupled
with
the
refusal
to
consider
alternatives
to
that
drastic
act
when
alternatives
were
presented
to
the
court
and
ultimately
aborting
the
trial.
as
the
trial
court
itself
noted
in
its
ordered,
in
the
petitioner’s
appeal
page
35
(a),
dinitz
was
essentially
without
counsel.
certainly,
he
was
essentially
without
counsel
because
the
court
had
just
escorted
counsel
to
the
parking
lot.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
trial
judge
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
he
thought
he
was
correct
in
doing
so,
but
upon
reflection
when
it
is
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
that
there
are
other
ways
of
curing
the
error
short
of
a
aborting
that
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
no
your
honor,
but
the
experienced
trial
judge,
i
submit,
should
not
have
reached
the
point
where
he
would
have
removed
the
attorney
for
an
act
that
is
not
considered
to
be
very
drastic
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
footnote
11
of
the
panel
decision
below,
the
majority
of
the
panel
concluded
that
perhaps
it
was
a
fact
distinction
between
the
trial
judge,
a
fact
misunderstanding
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
defense
counsel.
keep
in
mind
that
from
the
record,
the
trial
judge
never
allowed
the
defense
counsel
to
examine
the
fbi
agents
that
he
had
called
on
proffer.
the
jury
was
out
of
the
room
at
that
time.
on
two
occasions
at
the
same
point
in
time,
the
defense
counsel
made
an
objection.
the
trial
judge
would
not
permit
the
objection
to
be
made.
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
objection
would
have
been.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
it
is
difficult
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
jury
was
ever
apprised
of
these
statements.
the
government
very
promptly
had
the
jury
removed
on
three
different
occasions.
the
last
time
the
jury
was
removed
never
to
return.
the
statements
occurred
on
proffer
when
the
judge
asked
the
attorney
to
now
present
what
he
was
going
to
tell
the
jury.
the
only
statement
that
the
jury
heard
was
this
is
the
case
of
the
incredible
witness.
the
government
promptly
stopped
him
from
going
further,
the
jury
was
then
removed.
so
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
your
honor
that
the
jury
was
infected
in
any
whatsoever
other
than
the
coming
in
and
out
of
court
on
two
different
occasions.
the
third
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
clearly,
your
honor,
the
judge
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
judge
was
admittedly
faced
with
the
dilemma,
but
it
was
a
dilemma
of
the
judge's
own
creation.
it
was
not
the
defendant’s
creation.
the
judge
removed
an
attorney
for
no
apparent
reason
and
then
said
what
do
we
do
now?
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
well,
certainly
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
a
trial
should
be
aborted
because
the
trial
attorney
offends
the
sensibilities
of
the
trial
judge
which
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
i
cannot
see
where
the
conduct
of
the
counsel
in
any
way
affected
the
jury
which
i
think
is
the
key.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
what
i
had
in
mind,
and
what
i
was
trying
to
tell
the
court
and
at
two
different
occasions
asked
the
court
to
reinstate
was
that
from
this
point
on
we
do
not
know
what
to
do.
we
want
that
attorney
back
in
courtroom,
he
has
been
paid
for.
the
defendant
is
now
a
popper.
we
do
not
know
what
to
do.
we
can
get
no
relief
from
the
fifth
circuit.
the
judge
refuses
to
allow
any
type
of
an
appeal
on
the
question
and
the
judge
refuses
to
reinstate
him
which
were
the
two
options.
as
far
as
we
could
say
and
the
voice
inflection
is
not
there,
the
judge
was
correct.
we
did
not
know
how
to
get
him
back
into
court.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
your
honor,
before
going
in
i
asked
him
would
he
reconsider
and
reinstate
mr.
wagner.
he
refused.
the
alternatives
advanced
to
him
appear
at
top
of
page
41,
not
at
the
bottom
page
41
and
the
only
alternatives
at
that
juncture
your
honor
and
today
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
only
alternatives
open
which
goes
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice's
issue
of
dilemma
was
either
reinstate
the
counsel,
unless
the
judge
could
give
clear
and
convincing
reasons
for
why
he
dismissed
him
in
the
first
place
or
in
the
alternative
allow
an
appeal
at
that
point,
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
determine
the
correctness
of
the
judge’s
actions.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
he
could
have
continued
the
trial
as
it
was
admittedly
and
that
would
not
have
produced
a
double
jeopardy
issue.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
i
am
sure.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
my
argument
would
have
to
be
that
we
would
hope
that
would
case
a
reversal
under
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
if
the
judge
had
continued
the
trial
we
would
have
gotten
a
new
trial.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
man
goes
free
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
only
because
the
fifth
amendment
demands
that
your
honor.
since
1824,
the
fifth
amendment
has
demanded
that
it
is
another
constitutional
right
involved
here.
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
judge.
you
are
absolutely
correct
and
the
chief
justice
was
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
there
was
nothing
else
to
do.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
defendant
did
not
want
us
to
go
onto
trial.
the
question
was
could
the
judge
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
defendant
does
not.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
that
is
what
the
–-
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
defendant
actually
agree
to
the
motion
for
mistrial.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
you
have
to
take
it
in
context
of
who
the
co-counsel
was
at
that
point.
look
the
judge
had
removed
an
attorney
and
the
judge
had
also
removed
a
theory
of
defense,
the
co-counsel
could
not
present
a
theory
of
defense.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
defendant
was
not
in
chambers
when
the
statement
was
made,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
it
happened
so
fast.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
meldon
did
not
object
to
that.
he
did
not.
no.
in
the
brief
time
i
have
remaining,
there
are
two
cases
that
i
would
like
to
focus
in
upon.
the
government
cites
to
tateo
versus
united
states
as
a
case
that
would
be
controlling
in
this
matter.
very
briefly
i
would
like
to
focus
in
upon
tateo
if
i
may.
tateo
is
not
similar
to
the
instant
case
in
that
in
tateo,
regardless
of
courtroom
conversation
between
the
judge
and
the
attorney
as
solicitor
general
cox
pointed
out
in
the
brief
for
the
government
in
that
case,
the
defendant
could
still
go
to
the
jury
with
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
defendant
had
a
choice.
he
could
have
disregarded
the
judge’s
attitude
and
then
appealed
the
sentence,
assuming
he
was
found
guilty,
or
he
could
have
gone
to
the
jury
and
ended
it
then
and
there
in
an
acquittal.
the
jury
had
in
no
way
been
infected
by
the
statement
of
the
judge
to
the
trial
counsel.
indeed,
the
only
thing
that
tateo
presents
perhaps
is
a
deprivation
of
a
fair
sentence,
not
the
deprivation
of
a
fair
trial.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
footnote
11
in
jorn,
it
stressed
in
footnote
11
in
jorn
that
since
tateo
was
not
foreclosed
of
options,
one
going
forward
or
two
appealing
going
forward
the
jury
had
in
no
way
been
infected,
the
case
in
tateo
is
different
because
in
the
instant
case
the
defendant
had
been
crippled
since
his
trial
attorney
had
been
removed
from
the
case.
one
other
case
so
that
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
he
had
not
been
crippled
by
what,
your
honor?
i
am
sorry.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
he
had
not
been
crippled
by
that,
no,
your
honor.
it
is
far
as
i
can
tell.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
the
court
very
carefully
removed
the
jury
and
the
court
did
not
focus
in
upon
that
particular
statement
when
the
court
had
counsel
ultimately
removed.
the
court
focused
in
upon
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
not
admissible
and
that
counsel
had
not
discussed
it
with
the
fbi
agents.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
it
was
made
before
the
jury,
yes
your
honor
but
the
government
promptly
objected
and
the
court
in
its
order
in
appendix
“a”
to
the
government’s
petition
does
not
mention
that
in
any
detail,
but
again
focuses
in
upon
the
fbi
and
the
fact
that
the
defense
counsel
was
going
to
impugn
the
integrity
of
the
chief
government
witness
in
this
particular
case.
the
government
also
cites
for
support
assuming
arguendo
that
ends
a
public
justice
are
involved
in
this
case,
illinois
versus
somerville.
i
suggest
that
illinois
versus
somerville
is
not
similar
to
this
particular
case.
in
illinois
versus
somerville,
the
judge
found
himself
within
an
incurably
defective
indictment.
the
defendant
had
absolutely
nothing
to
lose
in
that
particular
case.
as
the
attorney
general
of
illinois,
william
scott
pointed
out
that
under
article
1,
section
7
of
the
illinois
constitution,
the
question
was
now
one
of
jurisdiction.
the
judge
no
longer
had
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
what
did
the
defendant
have
to
lose?
he
could
have
gone
to
the
jury.
if
the
jury
had
found
him
guilty
he
would
have
received
an
automatic
reversal.
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
there
is
doubt
in
the
attorney
general’s
opinion
brief
that
he
could
have
been
retried,
that
is
even
though
it
is
jurisdictional.
mr.
fletcher
n.
baldwin,
jr.
clearly,
it
was
a
gamble
your
honor
in
that
he
could
have
not
have
been
found
guilty
by
that
jury.
he
could
have
only
been
found
innocent
by
that
jury.
in
the
instant
case,
if
the
defendant
had
retained
his
trial
counsel,
if
the
court
had
not
removed
his
trial
counsel,
he
could
have
gone
to
that
jury
and
ended
it
the
matter
then
and
there.
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
two
distinctions
in
somerville
are
first
of
all,
there
were
not
options
realistic
in
somerville,
therefore,
jorn
that
demands
as
to
panel
suggested
below,
curable
options
to
be
first
considered
before
drastic
action
such
as
abortion
of
a
trial
occurs,
remains
intact.
for
these
reasons,
it
is
respectfully
requested
that
the
decision
of
the
en
banc
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
