mr.
john
p.
rupp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
petitioned
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
after
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
it
held
en
banc
with
seven
judges
dissenting
that
respondent
for
prosecution
had
been
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
procedural
context
in
which
respondent's
double
jeopardy
claim
arose
is
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
main
brief.
in
order
to
provide
a
basis
for
discussion
of
the
legal
principles
that
we
believe
control
this
case,
however,
and
because
the
government’s
factual
statement
does
not
accord
precisely
with
that
relied
upon
by
respondent,
i
should
like
to
begin
this
morning
by
reviewing
some
of
the
events
that
preceded
determination
of
respondent's
first
trial.
respondent
was
charged
in
two
counts
of
a
three-count
indictment
with
having
conspired
to
distribute
and
with
having
distributed
a
control
substance,
lsd.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
he
retained
jeffrey
meldon
to
represent
him
and
so
far
as
appears
in
the
record,
mr.
meldon
continued
to
represent
respondent
without
assistance
until
approximately
five
days
before
the
trial
began.
this
representation
included
the
filing
of
several
pre-trial
motions
and
investigation
into
the
charges
and
the
complaint,
rather
the
indictment
and
of
the
circumstances
of
respondent’s
arrest.
at
the
time
of
trial,
however,
respondent
appeared
with
three
retained
attorneys,
mr.
meldon,
morris
wagner,
and
my
brother
professor
baldwin.
after
the
jury
had
been
selected
and
sworn
in
this
case,
they
were
excuse
from
the
courtrooms
so
that
the
court
could
hear
evidence
and
argument
on
respondent’s
motion
to
suppress
the
lsd.
in
support
of
that
motion,
mr.
wagner
called
the
government’s
principal
witness,
steve
cox,
the
agent
who
had
purchased
the
lsd.
as
mr.
wagner’s
questioning
of
cox
proceeded
it
became
apparent
that
the
motion
to
suppress
was
without
a
factual
basis
and
that
indeed
the
theory
being
relied
upon
by
wagner
in
support
of
the
motion
and
support
of
his
request
for
hearing
on
the
motion
would
not
have
justified,
would
not
have
warranted
the
suppression
of
the
lsd.
the
court,
therefore,
became
understandably
annoyed
with
mr.
wagner,
particularly
when
he
persisted
on
asking
questions
of
cox
that
bore
no
conceivable
relation
to
the
motion
to
suppress
under
any
theory.
the
court
not
surprisingly,
ultimately
denied
the
motion
to
suppress.
since
the
government’s
case
rests
principally
upon
the
testimony
of
steve
cox,
the
anticipated
testament
of
steve
cox,
mr.
wagner's
strategy
was
to
attack
mr.
cox’s
credibility.
his
aim
was
to
convince
the
court
that
mr.
cox’s
testimony
would
not
be
worthy
of
belief
because
mr.
cox
had
been
involved
in
some
way
in
an
extortion
attempt
that
allegedly
directed
at
respondent.
the
principal
problem
with
this
defense
was
that
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
linking
mr.
cox
with
the
alleged
extortion,
the
fact
that
neither
prevented
mr.
wagner
from
proceeding
with
that
line
of
defense
in
his
opening
statement.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
it
was
made
before
any
testimony
was
presented.
the
government,
the
assistant
general
attorney
responsible
for
the
case
made
an
opening
statement
of
just
a
couple
of
minutes
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
mr.
wagner’s
opening
statement
proceeded
immediately
from
there.
we
have
discussed
the
substance
of
mr.
wagner’s
opening
statement
at
pages
4
through
7
of
our
main
brief
and
that
statement
as
whole
appears
in
the
appendix
on
pages
19
through
29.
i
do
not
think
that
any
particularly
useful
purpose
would
be
served
by
my
reviewing
here
the
substance
of
the
statement.
even
a
cursory
reading
of
it
reveals
we
submit
that
the
trial
court’s
judgment
that
mr.
wagner
was
bent
upon
a
conscious
course
of
baiting
the
court
in
hope
of
declaring
a
mistrial
was
not
only
a
reasonable
judgment,
but
very
probably
an
accurate
one
as
well.
after
mr.
wagner
had
been
excluded
from
the
courtroom,
the
court
was
informed
for
the
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
mr.
wagner
had
never
been
admitted
to
practice
before
the
northern
district
of
florida.
he
had
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
trial
only.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
and
not
by
double
jeopardy.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
i
cannot
cite
you
a
specific
case.
it
is
certainly
not
inconceivable
to
me,
however,
that
misconduct
engaged
in
by
an
attorney
could
reach
a
point
at
which
it
would
be
appropriate
to
exclude
the
man
or
the
woman
from
the
courtroom.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
or
from
the
building.
well,
from
the
courtroom
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
formulation
used
by
the
court
in
this
case
to
exclude
mr.
wagner
from
the
courtroom
may
have
been
too
colorful.
his
purpose
was
to
exclude
mr.
wagner
from
further
participation
in
the
trial
which
is
what
he
did.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
had
he
returned
to
the
courtroom,
it
is
at
least
arguable
that
he
would
have
been
in
contempt
of
court?
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct
and
on
this
facts,
we
submit
to
you
that
that
was
appropriate.
although,
i
hasten
to
add
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
what
i
said
was
that
during
the
motion
to
suppress,
he
had
annoyed
the
judge.
i
think
there
were
good
grounds
for
the
court
having
admonished
him
at
that
point
to
proceed
more
properly.
during
his
opening
statement,
however,
he
was
rendering
a
trial,
a
chaotic
at
best.
he
was
refusing
to
comply
with
the
court’s
very
clear
instructions.
he
persisted
in
proceeding
with
the
line
of
defense
which
he
knew
was
without
any
factual
basis.
it
was
more
than
mere
annoyance
at
that
point.
there
was
a
cumulative
series
of
events
that
occurred
in
this
case
and
they
occurred
rather
quickly
i
would
concede,
but
they
seem
to
me
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
wagner
was
attempting
to
trigger
a
mistrial
in
this
case.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
has
to
agree
with
me
on
that
point
in
order
to
find
that
respondent’s
retrial
was
not
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
think,
however,
that
it
is
a
fact.
after
wagner
had
been
excluded
from
the
courtroom
as
i
said,
the
court
was
informed
for
the
first
time
that
respondent
was
not
prepared
to
permit
his
two
remaining
attorneys
to
proceed
on
his
behalf.
the
court
was
informed
of
this
decision
the
second
time
at
a
conference
in
chambers
the
morning
following
wagner’s
exclusion.
at
the
same
conference,
mr.
meldon
for
the
first
time
and
now
the
court
as
had
been
suggested
by
my
brother
professor
baldwin,
stated
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
might
be
appropriate.
the
session
in
chambers
was
suspended
to
permit
the
parties
more
fully
to
consider
that
as
well
as
other
available
options
and
when
reconvened,
mr.
meldon
did
in
fact
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
respondent’s
behalf
explaining
to
the
court
in
a
statement
which
appears
on
page
41
of
the
appendix,
“that
your
honor,
i
have
conferred
with
the
defendant
and
he
wishes
to
move
for
a
mistrial
at
this
time
and
after
full
consideration
of
the
situation
and
an
explanation
of
the
alternatives
before
him,
he
feels
that
he
would
move
for
a
mistrial
and
that
this
would
be
in
his
best
interest.”
the
court
then
asked
the
government
to
respond
to
that
motion.
the
government
responded,
“your
honor,
we
have
discussed
this
at
some
length
and
we
think
that
for
the
reasons
you
have
already
set
forth
in
the
record
a
mistrial
might
be
appropriate
in
this
case
and
the
government
would
not
oppose
a
mistrial.”
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
it
does
show
that.
at
the
session
in
chambers,
the
morning
following
mr.
wagner’s
exclusion,
the
court
not
only
has
saved
the
various
options
that
were
available,
including
a
continuance,
but
also
explained
rather
fully
his
reasons
for
having
excluded
mr.
wagner.
now
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
considering
the
possibility
of
a
continuance
concluded
that
a
continuance
would
not
have
been
proper
in
this
case
because
of
the
defendant’s,
respondent
in
this
court’s
position
that
he
would
not
permit
either
mr.
meldon
or
professor
baldwin
to
represent
him
a
trial.
so
he
would
have
been
in
a
position
then
of
having
to
get
entirely
new
counsel
and
sufficient
time
would
have
to
have
been
afforded
to
permit
him
to
get
up
to
speed
on
the
case.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
now,
that
would
have
required
only
a
minor
continuance.
at
the
time
though,
although
the
court
knew
that
respondent
was
a
third
year
law
student
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
prepared
to
proceed
pro
se.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
session
in
chambers
was
suspended
to
permit
him
to
consider
not
only
the
propriety
of
a
mistrial
at
that
point,
but
other
options.
the
record
does
not
indicate
what
was
discussed
by
mr.
meldon,
professor
baldwin
and
respondent.
i
think
it
is
fair
assumption
that
all
available
options
were
discussed.
what
we
know
from
the
record
is
that
when
the
session
was
reconvened,
mr.
meldon
stated
that
he
had
discussed
the
available
options,
i
assume
including
a
continuance,
though
i
cannot
say
the
categorically,
and
they
had
decided,
that
the
respondent
had
decided
that
his
best
interest
would
be
served
by
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
at
that
point.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
life
of
this
jury
was,
although
perhaps
should
have
a
further
point
here
and
that
is
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
publicity
that
had
attended
this
case,
publicity
in
the
press
and
at
the
time
that
he
ultimately
declared
a
mistrial,
he
referred
specifically
to
the
publicity
as
posing
in
his
view
a
problem.
when
this
case
was
called
for
trial
and
abnormal
number
of
press
people
appeared
and
that
increased
the
judge's
apprehensions.
so
that
permitting
the
jury
to
go
free,
that
is
not
sequestering
them,
in
this
case
would
have
posed
more
serious
problems
than
even
in
the
normal
case
and
that
is
apart
from
the
problem
of
the
life
of
jury.
prior
to
a
second
trial,
respondent
moved
for
the
dismissal
of
all
charges
against
him
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
and
alternatively
to
have
mr.
wagner
reinstated,
both
motions
were
denied.
the
fifth
circuit
appeal
to
his
ensuing
conviction
at
a
trial
in
which
he
proceeded
pro
se
and
the
government’s
petition
to
this
court
followed.
although
this
court
has
repeatedly
refused
to
fashion
fixed
and
inflexible
rules
to
govern
the
consideration
of
double
jeopardy
claims,
the
decided
cases
do
provide
some
guidelines
that
are
responsive
to
and
reflective
of
the
policies
subsumed
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
one
of
the
most
fundamental
of
this
guidelines
was
that
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
united
states
versus
jorn
and
that
is
where
circumstances
developed
not
attributable
to
prosecutorial
or
judicial
overreaching,
a
motion
by
a
defendant
for
a
mistrial
is
ordinarily
assumed
to
remove
any
barrier
to
the
prosecution,
even
if
the
defendant’s
motion
is
necessitated
by
prosecutorial
or
judicial
error.
if
the
events
that
respondent’s
first
trial
leaves
some
questions
without
a
satisfactory
answer,
they
do
what
they
are
sufficient
to
establish
it
seems
to
me,
both
the
appropriateness
generally
of
attaching
significance
to
a
defendant’s
motion
to
have
his
trial
ended
with
a
mistrial
and
the
correctness
of
holding
here
that
any
barrier
to
respondents
for
prosecution
was
removed
by
his
decision
to
move
for
a
mistrial.
the
history
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
the
instances
of
its
application
in
previously
decided
cases
show
that
the
policies,
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
to
further
conceived
of
the
clause
as
a
buffer
between
the
state
and
individual
defendants
and
to
protect
the
individual
against
harassment
and
abuse
of
the
judicial
process.
the
clause
embodies
are
commitment
to
repose
following
an
acquittal,
preventing
successive
trials
following
a
valid
conviction
as
well
as
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense
and
maximizing
the
chances
fairly
of
resolving
criminal
charges
in
a
single
proceeding.
but
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
cannot
be
used
to
frustrate
legitimate
suicidal
interest
in
punishing
those
and
bringing
to
the
bar
of
justice
those
who
are
charged
with
crime
and
at
the
interest
of
society
and
of
criminal
defendants
are
in
some
circumstances
best
served
by
permitting
defendants
to
move
for
a
mistrial
and
permitting
courts
to
grant
such
motions.
in
united
states
versus
perez,
this
court
held
that
a
second
trial
would
not
offend
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
if
the
jurors
at
the
first
trial
have
been
unable
to
agree
upon
a
verdict.
and
in
united
states
versus
ball,
and
united
states
versus
tateo,
that
a
second
trial
was
permissible
if
the
first
trial,
if
the
conviction
rendered
at
the
first
trial
as
was
reversed
on
direct
appeal
or
in
a
collateral
proceeding.
permitting
a
defendant
to
move
to
terminate
his
trial
and
giving
discretion
to
a
court
to
grant
such
a
motion
in
the
face
of
perceived
prejudice
is
consistent
with
these
rules
and
simply
acknowledges
the
unfairness,
the
inefficiency
requiring
defendants
to
go
forth
in
the
face
of
perceived
prejudice.
there
are
limits
of
course
and
the
limits
have
been
stated
in
cases
such
as
gori
versus
the
united
states,
downum,
jorn
and
so
on
where
the
defendant
moves
for
a
mistrial,
retrial
is
not
permitted
if
the
precipitating
event
is
attributable
to
judicial
or
prosecutorial
over
reaching,
that
is
action
by
the
court
or
the
prosecutor
designed
to
avoid
an
acquittal
by
the
jury
then
empaneled.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
in
both
of
those
cases
the
mistrial
was
declared
by
the
court
sua
sponte.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
you
have
not.
what
you
have
said
as
a
i
just
noted,
you
have
left
opened
a
case
in
which
if
there
were
credible
evidence
of
judicial
or
prosecutorial
over
reaching
that
would
present
a
case
in
which
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
attach
a
controlling
weight
to
the
fact
of
a
defendant’s
motion
for
a
mistrial.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
it
is
a
sense
by
court
of
the
prosecutor
in
my
judgment
that
the
case
is
not
going
well
for
the
side
that
that
person
would
wish
to
prevail
and
the
triggering
of
a
mistrial
to
forestall
an
adverse
verdict.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
it
was
sua
sponte
as
well.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
that
is
still
the
rule
in
cases
that
are
tried
to
the
court.
the
british
rule
of
course
is
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
the
rule
in
the
united
states
has
been
since
downum,
since
gori
that
in
trials
before
a
jury,
jeopardy
attaches
at
the
moment
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn,
although
this
court
has
also
said
that
that
is
the
beginning,
not
the
end
of
the
analysis
and
i
think
that
is
correct.
the
wisdom
of
permitting
a
defendant
to
move
for
a
mistrial
in
the
face
of
perceived
prejudice
and
not
requiring
him
to
go
to
an
ultimate
verdict
would
appear
to
me
to
be
almost
beyond
dispute.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
noted
in
the
united
states
versus
tateo
what
would
be
high
price
indeed
for
society
to
pay
where
every
accused
granted
immunity
from
punishment
because
of
any
defects
sufficient
to
constitute
reversible
error
in
the
proceedings.
it
is
significant
i
think
as
well
that
from
the
standpoint
of
a
defendant,
it
is
doubtful
as
mr.
justice
harlan
noted
that
appellate
courts
would
be
as
zealous
as
they
are
now
in
protecting
against
convictions
rendered
in
part
on
the
basis
of
prejudicial
errors
if
they
knew
that
reversing
the
conviction
would
put
a
defendant
beyond
the
reach
of
further
prosecution.
if
retrial
were
barred
following
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial,
but
permitted
following
the
defendant’s
successful
appeal,
i
think
that
what
we
must
expect
is
that
trial
courts
would
deny
such
motion
in
a
vast
majority
of
cases
and
perhaps
for
very
much
the
same
reasons
as
mr.
justice
harlan
in
this
court
felt
that
the
result
reached
in
detail
was
necessary.
the
majority
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
expressly
declined
to
hold
in
this
case
that
the
court’s
actions
in
excluding
mr.
wagner
was
a
product
of
judicial
overreaching.
that
is
action
by
the
court
designed
to
avoid
an
acquittal
and
respondent
is
never
contended
in
this
court
or
prior
to
this
time
that
the
court
was
guilty
of
overreaching.
although
we
have
not
urged
that
this
court
to
hold
that
the
exclusion
of
wagner
was
not
error,
neither
is
it
at
all
important
to
the
position
we
have
taken
in
this
court,
that
is
that
respondent’s
re-persecution
was
not
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
even
if
error,
the
court’s
exclusion
of
wagner
was
not
unlike
the
multitude
of
other
errors
that
occurred
during
criminal
trials.
in
fact,
i
should
like
to
note
in
this
regard
that
during
the
conference
in
chambers,
the
morning
following
mr.
wagner’s
exclusion,
mr.
meldon
and
my
brother
professor
baldwin
stated
that
in
their
judgment,
the
exclusion
of
wagner
had
been
proper.
mr.
meldon
stated
after
spending
considerable
time
looking
into
the
law,
it
is
my
opinion,
i
believe
the
opinion
of
professor
baldwin
that
the
action
of
the
court
yesterday
was
well
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
would
not
be
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
professor
baldwin
subsequently
informed
the
court
after
a
full
night’s
research,
it
is
my
conclusion
that
the
court’s
action
was
proper.
these
are
the
people
with
the
court
who
are
in
the
best
position
to
assess
both
the
effect
of
mr.
wagner’s
opening
statement
on
the
jury
and
they
both
concluded
that
the
exclusion
of
mr.
wagner
at
that
point
at
least
had
not
constituted
reversible
error
and
not
during
the
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
attached
very
significant
weight
to
that.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
declare
a
mistrial.
ultimately
no,
ultimately
i
think
the
same
result
would
be
reach.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
now,
if
this
case
were
being
measured
pursuant
to
manifest
necessity
standard
as
we
argued
in
our
main
brief,
we
believe
that
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
by
court
sua
sponte
at
the
point
at
which
the
mistrial
was
declared
was
justified
by
manifest
necessity
in
the
ends
of
public
justice.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
we
would
arrive
at
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit,
the
majority
of
the
fifth
circuit
fundamentally
misconceived
the
manifest
necessity
standard
by
looking
at
the
circumstances
that
existed
at
the
time
wagner
was
excluded,
rather
than
at
circumstances
that
existed
at
the
time
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
was
being
considered.
by
definition,
if
manifest
necessity
requires
a
particular
act
to
be
taken,
that
action
is
not
error
so
we
would
not
be
talking
about
error
at
all.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
money.
it
was
best
to
abort
the
trial.
yes,
that
would
be
a
quite
decision.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
very
significant
difference
when
it
is
the
defendant
who
moves
to
take
the
trial
away
from
the
tribunal
then
empaneled,
the
jury
then
empaneled
and
the
court
act
sua
sponte.
now,
in
my
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
we
believe
very
strongly
that
the
manifest
necessity
standard,
the
sua
sponte
standard
would
have
warranted
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
and
would
not
have
barred
respondent’s
re-prosecution
in
this
case.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
they
are.
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
suggest
as
respondents
have
and
required
to
do
that
the
guilty
plea
entered
by
the
defendant
in
tateo
was
more
voluntary
than
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
entered
by
the
defendant
in
this
case.
the
guilty
plea
in
tateo
was
subsequently
found
to
have
been
coerced.
now,
whether
tateo
was
rightly
or
wrongly
decided,
there
is
a
good
deal
less
coercion,
in
fact,
no
coercion
in
this
case.
the
defendant
as
i
was
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
yes,
but
it
is
not
waiver.
well,
let
me
back
off
from
that.
in
a
number
of
cases,
this
court
has
attempted
to
come
to
grips
with
the
theory
for
double
jeopardy
cases
of
this
sort
and
mr.
justice
holmes
at
one
point
suggested
a
continuing
jeopardy
theory,
other
courts
have
found
that
a
waiver
theory
would
be
appropriate.
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
appropriately
decided
that
those
were
rather
arid
exercises
and
what
the
court
should
abide
in
cases
of
this
sort
is
looking
at
that
policies
that
are
subsumed
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
the
circumstances
that
existed
at
the
point
the
mistrial
was
both
declared
by
the
court
sua
sponte
or
pursuant
to
a
defense
motion
and
then
decide
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
properly
invoked.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
perhaps.
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
since
one
of
the
policies
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
maximize
the
opportunity
that
a
criminal
proceeding
would
be
brought
to
judgment
in
a
single
proceeding
and
defendants
do
have
an
interest
which
we
acknowledge
in
having
a
cost
determined
by
a
particular
tribunal,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
would
move
for
a
mistrial
is
an
indication
and
i
think
rather
an
impeachable
one
that
he
regards
his
opportunity
to
proceed
as
respondent
did
here
is
over
weighed
by
other
considerations.
in
this
case,
it
was
over
weighed
by
considerations
such
as
the
fact
that
mr.
wagner
had
proceeded
to
inform
the
jury
of
a
line
of
defense
that
he
simply
could
not
prove
and
no
evidence
along
those
lines
would
have
been
admissible
at
trial.
the
court
had
been
required
to
excuse
the
jury
three
times
in
the
course
of
only
a
few
moments,
mr.
wagner
had
been
admonished,
the
decision
by
respondent
in
this
case
to
try
again
on
another
day
seems
to
me
to
have
been
a
legitimate
and
reasonable
decision
under
the
circumstances
and
clearly
not
coerced.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
mention
that
even
if
one
concedes
that
the
choice
that
respondent
had
to
make
in
this
case
was
a
hard
choice,
it
was
a
case
that
was
presented
to
him
in
no
small
part
because
of
the
misconduct
of
his
own
attorney.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
sat
idly
by
while
events
passed
him
by
without
him
being
able
to
affect
them.
here
it
was
defense's
misconduct
that
brought
this
trial
to
the
impasse.
in
that
regard,
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
a
recent
opinion
written
by
judge
friendly
in
which
he
discusses
a
situation
not
unlike
the
situation
with
which
we
have
been
presented
here.
i
have
given
a
copy
of
this
opinion,
united
states
versus
gentile
and
laponzina
and
i
will
provide
copies
to
the
court
through
the
clerks
since
it
is
not
yet
reported.
in
gentile
as
in
this
case,
there
was
substantial
indications
that
defense
attorneys
were
attempting
to
use
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
a
sword,
if
you
permit
me
to
use
that,
engaging
in
rather
sharp
practices
in
hope
of
a
triggering
mistrial
while
at
the
same
time
having
the
double
jeopardy
clause
available
to
appeal
to
when
the
re-prosecution
occurred.
for
the
reason
stated
by
judge
friendly,
for
the
reason
stated
in
our
main
brief,
we
think
that
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
occur.
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
remaining
moments.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
nothing
further,
thank
you.
