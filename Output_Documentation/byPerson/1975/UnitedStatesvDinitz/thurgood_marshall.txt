justice

marshall
i
understood
he
was
excluded
from
the
courtroom
and
the
building
and
told
do

ever
come
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
disbarment?
justice
thurgood
marshall

as

justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
other
case
where

colorful,
if

arrested,
it
is
not
just
colorful?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
told
the
marshal,
you
make
sure
he
gets
out
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
every
time
a
lawyer
annoys
the
judge,
he
should
be
abolished
from
the
building
because
you
said
all
he
did
was
annoy
him,
that
was
your
word?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
he
was
actually
tried,

clause,
you
could

least
raised
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall

justice
thurgood
marshall

trial,
what
did
the
defendant
want,
a
mistrial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
