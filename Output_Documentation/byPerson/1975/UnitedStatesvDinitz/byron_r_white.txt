how
much
weight
do
you
accord
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
moved
for
mistrialt?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
will
have
a
different
position
if
the
court
itself
had
on
its
own
motion
said
in
view
of
the
circumstances
here
i
declare
a
mistral?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
would
arrive
at
that
result,
whether
you
consider
the
exclusion
to
be
error
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
that
it
was
error
and
then
make
a
manifest
necessity
argument,
would
it
not
be
just
that
the
judge
realized
that
it
was
error
and
that
there
was
inevitable
error
in
the
record
and
rather
than
waste
everybodyâ€™s
time
and
energy
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
you
mean
by
manifest
necessity?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
brother
argues
that
the
motion
was
involuntary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
your
response
would
be
even
if
it
was,
there
is
no
error
in
declaring
mistrial
because
it
would
have
been
quite
valid
even
if
there
had
been
no
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
you
had
to
put
aside
the
motion
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
involuntary
or
had
been
coerced
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
you
decide
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
decide
it?
would
you
have
thought
it
was
error
to
continue
the
trial
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
not
just
arguable
in
your
opinion
that
would
have
violated
his
right
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
trial
judge
thought
he
was
correct
in
doing
so
and
everybody
in
sight
agreed
with
him,
including
the
remaining
counsels?
