justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rupp,
was
the
opening
statement
made
before
any
testimony
was
presented
or
at
the
closing
of
prosecution's
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
have
some
problem
with
the
continuance
once
the
jury
has
been
empaneled,
do
you
not,
because
you
could
not
simply
go
to
another
jury,
it
would
have
to
be
at
least
during
life
of
that
jury
panel
that
the
case
was
retried?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
either
downum
or
gori
motions
by
the
defendant
for
mistrial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
never
held
in
this
court,
have
we,
after
the
defendant
himself
moved
for
a
mistrial
that
the
re-prosecution
was
barred
by
double
jeopardy
in
any
particular
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
read
that
language
as
overreaching
as
meaning
to
as
trying
the
defendant
of
a
very
possible
favorable
verdict
from
the
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
manifest
necessity
is
not
the
same
when
the
defendant
moves
for
a
mistrial,
say
as
when
the
prosecutor
moves
for
a
mistrial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
have
been
up
against
jorn,
had
it
not
been
a
defendantâ€™s
motion
here,
in
a
way
that
you
are
at
least
arguably
not
when
the
defendant
moves?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
exclude
from
consideration
the
fact
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
moved
for
a
mistrial,
we
would
be
in
a
position
of
having
to
assess
the
circumstances
that
exist
when
a
mistrial
was
being
considered
by
the
manifest
necessity
standard.
now,
and
we
believe
that
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial
sua
sponte
would
have
been
justified
in
these
circumstances.
the
difference
between
downum
and
jorn
in
this
case
in
part
is
that
downum
and
jorn
could
have
preceded
to
judgment.
nothing
had
occurred
at
the
point
at
which
a
mistrial
was
declared
in
either
of
those
cases
that
gave
any
indication
that
an
ensuing
conviction
would
not
have
been
invulnerable.
if
there
was
going
to
be
error,
it
would
have
been
subsequent
error.
those
trials
could
have
proceeded.
it
was
reasonable
for
the
court
to
conclude
here
that
this
trial
could
not
proceed,
but
it
could
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
error
or
not,
that
is
right.
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
respondent's
--
that
the
motion
made
by
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
involuntary.
there
were
a
whole
range
of
options
which
the
respondent
could
have
pursued
other
than
moving
for
a
mistrial.
he
could
have
permitted
professor
baldwin
and
mr.
meldon
who
had
represented
him
until
five
days
before
trial
began
to
represent
him
at
the
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
interrupt
you
mr.
rupp.
is
the
test
under
the
language
of
justice
harlan
in
tateo
and
jorn
whether
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
by
the
defendant
is
involuntary
or
not
or
is
it
not
whether
it
is
in
response
to
the
sort
of
of
overreaching
by
the
prosecution
that
you
mentioned
a
moment
earlier
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
every
possible
favorable
verdict?
those
are
two
different
things,
i
would
say.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
telegram
raised
both
fifth
and
sixth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
you
mentioned
the
fifth
amendment,
did
you
have
double
jeopardy
in
mind?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baldwin,
as
i
read
the
transcript
on
page
41
right
before
the
motion
for
mistrial
where
the
court
is
in
chambers
the
next
day,
the
judge
gives
the
impression
at
least
of
being
open-minded
as
to
other
possibilities.
he
says
have
you
gentleman
any
further
thought
about
how
we
should
proceed
in
this
matter
and
then
mr.
meldon
comes
forth
and
says,
your
honor,
i
conferred
with
the
defendant
and
he
wishes
me
to
move
for
a
mistrial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
be
that
as
it
may.
it
was
the
defendant
that
moved
for
a
mistrial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
were
associated
with
mr.
meldon
on
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
district
court
and
you
are
here
now
telling
us
that
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
representing
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
did
make
the
motion
for
mistrial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
said
after
conferring
with
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
none
of
our
cases
have
ever
held
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
our
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
jury
found
him
not
guilty,
i
doubt
that
he
could
have
been
retried?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
he
had
that
to
lose,
the
right
to
go
to
trial
with
the
original
jury
and
hope
for
a
verdict
of
not
guilty?
