when
the
defendant
makes
a
motion,
does
that
introduce
under
the
scales,
an
element
of
waiver?

well,
does
that
analysis
suggest
that
much
significance
ought
not
be
attached
to
the
mere
fact
that
the
defendant
made
the
motion,
if
the
focus
is
to
be
on
the
policies
covered
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
