justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
rupp,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
alternatives
that
were
presented
by
the
judge
included
the
possibility
of
a
continuance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
the
respondent
given
the
option
of
electing
to
have
a
continuance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
baldwin,
on
page
38
of
the
appendix
when
you
stated
that
the
court’s
action
was
proper
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
what
action
of
the
court
were
you
referring
to
at
that
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
proper
in
having
excluded
mr.
wagner?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
it
came
at
the
same
way
from
the
other
counsel
also?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
action
of
the
court
yesterday
was
well
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
will
not
be
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
only
relevance
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
at
the
moment
of
what
you
said
then
was
that
if
you
and
your
co-counsel
thought
that
the
action
of
the
court
was
proper,
how
could
you
continue
to
press
for
the
reinstatement
of
mr.
wagner
and
say
you
thereby
were
deprived
when
the
court
denied
that
renewal
of
your
motion
of
all
action?
do
you
agree
the
court’s
action
had
been
proper?
that
is
an
awkward
way
to
put
it,
but
i
think
you
understand
my
point.
