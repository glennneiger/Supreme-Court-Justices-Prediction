that
is
by
deliberate
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wait
because
you
remind
--
refresh
my
recollection
just
a
movement
over
the
facts
in
jorn,
who
moved
for
a
mistrial
there?
was
that
sua
sponte?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
was
violated
by
the
retrial
of
the
respondent
on
a
criminal
charge
after
his
original
trial
had
ended
in
a
mistrial,
which
had
been
granted
at
his
request.
under
the
circumstances
presented
by
the
record
in
his
case,
rather
unusual
circumstances,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
mistaken
in
finding
that
the
retrial
violated
the
respondent’s
constitutional
right
not
to
be
twice
put
in
jeopardy.
accordingly,
the
judgment
before
us
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
court’s
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
