chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
dinitz.
mr.
rupp
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
baldwin.
before
you
get
under
way,
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
given
all
the
circumstances
shown
by
this
record
and
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
mistrial
by
the
judge,
do
you
think
there
would
have
been
a
pretty
good
case
for
reversal
of
this
action
denying
this
trial,
had
a
conviction
of
guilty
followed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
only
occasion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
lawyer
has
made
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
and
the
judge
after
considering
it
denied
it
and
the
man
is
tried
and
found
guilty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy
case
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say,
you
would
have
a
good
case
on
any
grant
of
a
mistrial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
usual
in
the
fifth
circuit,
counsel
if
you
know,
for
them
to
have
a
re-grant
rehearing
en
banc
and
then
have
no
oral
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
re-consideration
on
en
banc,
but
not
rehearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
the
telegram
relevant
to
this
case
that
even
outside
the
record
if
on
the
following
day,
the
motion
was
made
by
the
defense
for
a
mistrial
without
raising
any
of
these
same
questions
for
reservations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
in
the
record
do
we
find
that
counsel
stated
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
long
before
the
reinstatement,
the
motion
for
mistrial,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
in
this
appendix
do
we
find
the
mistrial
motion
itself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there.
mr.
baldwin
you
may
continue
at
1
o’clock.
[lunch
break]mr.
baldwin
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
now
that
on
this
record,
it
shows
that
the
statements
made
in
the
opening
statement
by
defense
counsel
were
supportable
statements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
thought
so
from
the
looking
at
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
motion
for
mistrial
was
made
by
the
defense
counsel,
would
you
agree
that
the
judge
was
presented
with
a
dilemma
that
was
not
easy
to
solve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
indicated
by
the
responses
of
yourself
and
your
co-counsel
expressing
the
view
that
the
judge’s
action
up
to
that
point
had
been
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
no
apparent
reason?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
without
reason.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
only
way
you
characterize
this
conduct
of
counsel
that
he
merely
offended
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why,
then
why
did
the
both
of
you
concede
to
the
court
separately
that
the
judge’s
action
was
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
judge
than
rested
on
the
matter
overnight
as
i
recall
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
the
next
morning
came
back
and
asked
you
if
you
and
your
co-counsel
if
you
had
any
suggestions
or
words
to
that
effect?
did
you
then
advance
some
alternatives
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
baldwin.
you
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-928,
united
states
against
dinitz
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
