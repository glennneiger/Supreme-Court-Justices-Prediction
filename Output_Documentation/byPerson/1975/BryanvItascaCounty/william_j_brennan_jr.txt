justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
is
75-5027
which
is
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
this
case
was
brought
by
a
chippewa
indian,
protesting
that
the
state
of
minnesota
had
no
jurisdiction
to
levy
a
property
tax
on
his
mobile
home
located
on
land
held
in
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
members
of
the
chippewa
tribe.
the
minnesota
courts
held
that,
they
did
indeed,
state
did
indeed
have
taxing
authority
that
it
had
that
authority
accredited
by
an
act
of
congress
section
4
(a)
of
public
law
280.
we
don't
read
public
law
280
as
did
the
minnesota
courts,
and
we
therefore,
reverse
on
the
ground
that
the
state
did
not
have
authority
to
impose
a
property
tax
on
petitioner's
on
mobile
home.
