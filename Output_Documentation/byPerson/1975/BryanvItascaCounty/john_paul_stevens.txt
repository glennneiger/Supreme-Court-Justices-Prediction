justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
a
little
confused
by
part
of
your
argument,
i
want
you
to
straighten
it
to
me.
i
understood
you
at
one
point
indicate
that
the
statute
was
enacted
in
response
to
a
request
from
the
indians
and
now
i
understand
that
you
would
be
saying
that
that
--
it
was
up
to
the
states
to
opt
it,
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
first
part
of
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
luther,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
please?
is
it
your
view
that
the
selection
of
the
states
originally
were
going
to
be
subject
to
a
law
280,
the
various
lands
were
subjected?
were
they
chosen
on
the
ground
that
they
are
more
ready
for
assimilation
and
than
the
higher
developed
areas
or
were
they
areas
where
there
was
a
greater
breakdown
in
law
and
order,
and
therefore,
a
greater
need
for
state
criminal
jurisdiction
or
is
it
clear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
might
make
quite
a
difference
in
whether
you
think
they
are
ready
to
pay
their
share
of
the
taxes
or
not?
which
view
you
take?
justice
john
paul
stevens
