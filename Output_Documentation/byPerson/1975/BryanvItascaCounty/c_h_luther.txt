mr.
c.
h.
luther
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
of
course
is
that
the
public
law
280
does
authorize
the
states
to
tax
indians
on
indian
reservations
with
the
exception
that
is
specifically
spelled
out
in
the
law
itself.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes,
your
honor,
i
would.
the
respondents’
position
is
based
on
four
considerations.
one
is
the
statute
itself,
the
second
is
the
legislative
history,
third,
is
the
judicial
decisions
and
the
fourth
is
the
policy.
with
respect
to
the
statute
itself,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
and
our
position
is
that
the
statute
grants
the
authority
to
the
states
to
have
the
civil
laws,
that
are
general
application
apply
in
indian
territory,
except
that
any
real
or
personal
property
that
is
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
or
subject
to
restriction
against
alienation
imposed
by
united
states
shall
not
be
subject
to
taxation.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
accepted
property
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
personal
property
which
is
not
held
in
trust
and
which
is
not
subject
to
restriction
against
alienation.
i
would
like
to
come
back,
but
perhaps
this
is
a
good
time
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
personal
property
or
real
property.
if
this
mobile
home
were
real
property,
it
would
be
exempt
from
taxation
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
this
case
was
tried
from
the
beginning
on
the
assumption
that
we
were
talking
about
here
is
a
tax
on
personal
property,
it
has
not
been
contended
in
the
district
court
nor
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court
or
until
now
that
this
mobile
home
for
the
purpose
of
this
litigation
constitutes
real
property.
but
as
i
say
if
this
court
were
to
assume
that
this
issue
were
open
in
the
case
which
i
do
not
believe
it
is,
and
were
to
assume
that
this
mobile
home
is
real
property
and
not
personal
property,
the
statute
exempts
that
property
from
taxation,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
anyway,
that
is
our
reading
of
the
statute.
secondly,
as
far
as
the
congressional
history,
the
legislative
history,
we
have
examined
that
very
carefully
and
it
is
not
helpful.
there
is
nothing
that
we
were
able
to
find
in
the
congressional
hearings
where
this
question
of
the
taxation,
whether
the
states
were
being
granted
authority
to
subject
the
indians
to
these
taxes
was
definitively
discussed
by
anybody.
so
i
am
afraid
that
we
cannot
have
any,
there
is
no
help,
of
course,
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
case.
as
far
as
the
judicial
decisions
are
concerned
we
have
four,
the
minnesota
district
court,
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
the
federal
district
court
in
nebraska
in
the
peter’s
case
which
was
affirmed
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
have
only
these
four
judicial
decisions
that
each
hold
that
public
law
280
does
grant
to
the
states
the
authority
and
jurisdiction
to
tax
the
indians,
except
for
the
accepted
property
which
i
have
mentioned.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
no,
your
honor.
that
was
quiet
a
different
issue
before
the
case
--
the
court
in
that
case.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes,
your
honor.
income
tax
was
the
issue
in
the
peter’s
case
--
mr.
c.
h.
luther
sales
tax?
well,
to
answer
your
question,
if
your
question
is
what
taxes
do
i
contend
that
this
public
law
208
authorizes
the
states
to
levy,
yes.
sales
tax,
income
tax,
gasoline
tax
--
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
any
tax
except
those
on
the
property
and
the
trust
property
itself
or
unrestricted
indian
property.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes,
we
do.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes,
it
is.
sales
tax
also
and
the
income
tax
too.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
i
do
not
know,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
c.
h.
luther
well,
the
indians
are
selling
properties
that
it
is
dealt
--
inheritance
tax
would
apply.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
well,
this
is
the
personal
property
tax
that
we
are
talking
about.
i
might
mention
that
this
is
a
rarity
because
the
personal
property
tax
is
no
longer
operative
in
the
state
of
minnesota
except
with
respect
to
certain
property
such
as
mobile
homes
which
are
taxed
as
real
property
--
as
personal
property
because
they
are
so
frequently
on
leased
land
that
it
is
not
administratively
feasible
to
tax
them
as
real
property.
other
than
that,
there
are
no
personal
property
taxes
in
minnesota.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
you
are
absolutely
right
sir,
we
could
not
tax
the
land.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
if
we
had
a
personal
property
tax
which
was
applicable
to
that
kind
of
personal
property,
yes.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
you
cannot
tax
the
land
itself
or
a
building
which
is
part
of
the
land
in
the
sense
that
is
real
property.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
no
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
mr.
becker
that
this
legislation
as
public
law
280,
when
it
started
out,
it
started
out
as
a
very,
it
started
out
having,
it
was
going
to
be
applicable
only
to
the
state
of
california
and
only
to
certain
indians
in
the
state
of
california
and
was
--
mr.
c.
h.
luther
criminal.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
well,
i
think
the
problem
that
precipitated
it,
was
it
started
out
as
a
criminal
statute
essentially
and
as
it
progressed
through
the
congress,
it
expanded
in
its
scope
and
then
expanded
from
merely
a
criminal,
subjecting
the
indians
to
the
state
criminal
laws
and
state
jurisdiction
in
criminal
matters
to
civil
which
is
the
section
that
we
are
speaking
off
and
then
that
expanded
and
progressed
to
the
point
where
it
included
not
only
giving
the
indians
access
to
the
state
courts
for
civil
litigation
purposes.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
exactly,
which
maybe
appropriate
now
to
bring
up
the
fourth
point
that
i
want
to
bring
up
which
is
the
policy
question.
the
express
policy
of
congress
at
that
the
time
this
law
was
enacted
was
one
of
integration
of
the
indians
into
the
community,
integration
and
assimilation.
and
this
law
was
a
step
as
the
courts
have
all
mentioned,
this
public
law
280
was
a
step
forward
affecting
that
congressional
policy
of
assimilation
and
integration
and
i
wish
to
make
this
very
clear
that
in
considering
and
in
construing
this
law
that
policy
be
kept
in
mind.
state-wise,
we
have
a
policy
consideration
too
and
that
is
the
indians
are
citizens
of
the
state.
they
have
all
the
rights
and
all
the
privileges
of
all
the
other
citizens
of
the
state
and
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we
feel
it
only
just
and
perhaps
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind,
only
just
improper
that
they
bear
their
fair
share
of
the
expenses
of
the
state.
now,
of
course
the
biggest
tax
impact
on
people
of
this
kind
is
the
tax
on
your
real
property
and
that
property
is
not
taxable.
that
is
never
has
been
and
has
not
specifically
excluded
in
taxation
in
this
law,
but
why
should
not
these
citizens
of
the
state
who
are
enjoying
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
all
the
other
citizens
of
the
state
share
in
the
expenses
at
least
to
the
extent
of
these
lesser
taxes
which
we
have
talked
about,
the
sales
tax,
the
gas
tax,
personal
property
tax.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes,
your
honor,
it
could
have
been
made
in
mcclanahan,
but
mcclanahan
did
not
have
public
law
280
and
this
was
of
course
is
the
major
difference
because
our
position
is
that
public
law
280
authorizes,
grants
us
jurisdiction
to
the
state
and
public
law
280
did
not
apply
in
the
mcclanahan
case.
it
did
not
apply
to
arizona.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
i
am
not
clear
on
that
your
honor,
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes.
i
suppose
it
would.
i
honestly
do
not
know
that
much
about
it.
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
answer
you
question.
mr.
c.
h.
luther
well,
i
would
defer
with
mr.
becker,
he
is
more
an
expert
than
i.
i
think
it
was
because
they
had
a
--
what
can
i
say,
a
better
tribal
operation
there.
in
another
words,
they
were
able
to
handle
their
problems
internally,
tribally
where
this
other
tribes
that
did
not
have
as
effective
an
organization.
that
is
why
--
mr.
c.
h.
luther
yes.
it
could
be.
if
there
is
no
further
questions,
that
is
all.
