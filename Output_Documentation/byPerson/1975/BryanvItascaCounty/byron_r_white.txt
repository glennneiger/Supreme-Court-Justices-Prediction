justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
kind
of
civil
law
of
the
state
have
general
applicability
under
law?
does
not
280
make
that
applicable
on
an
indian
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
i
know
you
tie
the
civil
laws
to
a
causes
of
action?
but
the
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
used
to
--
i
know
you
do,
but
--
but
it
just
says,
and
those
civil
laws
of
such
state
or
territory
that
are
of
general
application
to
private
persons
or
private
properties
shall
have
the
same
force
and
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
to
make
it
--
you
give
the
indians
some
insurance,
you
would
say,
nothing
in
this
section
shall
authorize
any
taxes
on
indians
or
their
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
want
be
complicated
about
it,
but
in
talking
about
trust
property,
you
just
give
the
broad
exemption,
which
is
what
you
are
arguing
for
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
with
the
respect
to
the
specific
areas
to
which
it
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
to
all,
and
they
excluded
certain
parts
of
certain
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
am
really
interested
in,
so
you
can
explain
it
so
that
i
understand
it,
is
the
principle
on
which
some
states
are
in
and
some
are
out.
is
that
prime
--
is
that
entirely
up
to
the
states
to
make
the
decision
or
was
there
indian
participation
in
the
various
decisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
tax
law
might
have
been
the
same
without
280?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
280,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
would
not
have
the
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
other
taxes
that
might
be
involved
here,
income
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
gasoline,
state
gasoline
taxes?
how
about
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
tax
of
general
applicability?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
have
a
state
gasoline
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
being
collected
on
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
inheritance?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
put
the
property
(inaudible)
trust
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
(unaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
said
that
extending
the
taxing
power
of
the
state
is
not
quiet
responsive
to
the
need
that
was
being
expressed
at
the
time,
is
it?
i
mean
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
then
the
problem
that
precipitated
the
issue
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
lack
of
remedies
and
the
lack
of
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
subject
to
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
sales
tax
on
a
reservation,
absent
280?
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
the
buck
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did
something
that
was
not,
that
did
not
exist
before
though,
did
not
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
worked
a
major
change?
