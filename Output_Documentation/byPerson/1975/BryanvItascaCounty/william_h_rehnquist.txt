is
not
inconsistent
with
any
applicable
civil
law
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
i
live
in
itasca
county
and
do
not
pay
my
taxes,
does
not
either
that
county
or
the
state
have
a
cause
of
action
against
me
for
failure
to
pay
the
taxes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
subsection
(b)
then,
which
purports
to
be
an
exemption
from
a
much
more
general
type
of
authority
i
think
that
you
are
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
moment
of
ago
this
was
a
lawyer’s
statute,
that
was
drafted
by
lawyers
and
presumably
using
legal
language
rather
than
just
language
of
general
applicability.
now,
certainly
a
lawyer
would
read
subsection
(b)
as
carving
out
a
portion
of
authority
that
is
otherwise
delegated,
would
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota’s
opinion
seem
to
go
on
the
idea
that
a
was
ambiguous
when
you
talk
about
all
civil
laws,
but
some
light
is
thrown
on
its
meaning
when
you
cease
b,
which
apparently
carves
out
otherwise
existing
authority
to
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
other
kind
of
authority
you
think
it
does
not
convey
other
than
taxing
authority?
