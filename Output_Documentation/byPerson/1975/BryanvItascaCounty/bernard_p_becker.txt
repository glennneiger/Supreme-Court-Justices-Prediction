mr.
bernard
p.
becker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
the
court
sustained
the
lower
court
decision,
imposing
and
granting
of
judgment
for
a
tax
on
a
mobile
home
owned
by
an
indian,
which
is
placed
on
trust
land.
the
case
originated
in
1972
in
the
county
court,
district
court
in
the
northern
part
of
the
leech
lake
reservation.
when
the
county
assessed
certain
taxes,
which
are
referred
to
in
state
law
as
mobile
home
tax
or
personal
property
taxes
on
this
mobile
home
owned
by
mr.
bryan
who
is
an
enrolled
member
of
the
tribe,
lives
with
his
family
in
this
house
trailer
at
sequoia
lake
on
the
reservation.
he
has
an
assignment
of
tribal
trust
land
from
the
tribe
which
he
uses
as
his
home
plot
upon
which
that
trailer
rests.
it
is
hooked
to
water
sewer
and
electricity.
the
district
court
held
that
public
law
280,
authorized
minnesota
to
place
and
impose
a
tax
on
this
kind
of
property,
a
mobile
home
used
by
an
indian
as
his
home.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
sustained
that
reading
of
the
statute
and
concluded
that
the
congress
changed
the
authority
that
had
heretofore
been
denied
to
the
states
and
allow
the
states
to
impose
their
tax
laws,
including
a
tax
law,
which
permitted
the
counties
to
collect
the
tax
on
this
indian’s
mobile
home.
the
statute
involved
here
is
commonly
known
as
public
law
280
and
if
the
court
please,
i
would
refer
to
it
as
public
law
280
throughout.
it
has
become
the
jargon
of
the
trade
so
to
speak.
the
citations
are
in
the
briefs.
it
was
passed
in
1953.
prior
to
that
time
and
as
confirmed
by
this
court
as
late
as
1973,
states,
absence
on
express
authorization
from
congress,
had
no
authority
to
impose
their
tax
laws
within
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation
on
an
indian
member
of
the
tribe,
we
are
not
discussing
non-indians.
in
1953,
due,
as
the
legislative
history
indicates
to
a
large
measure,
a
breakdown
on
some
reservations
of
law
and
order
and
in
effect
to
tribal
court
justice
system,
the
congress
passed
public
law
280.
public
law
280
provided
that
criminal
offenses
committed
by
or
against
indians
within
the
indian
country
in
certain
specified
states,
along
which
was
minnesota,
accepting
the
red
lake
reservation,
would
be
prosecutable
in
state
courts.
on
the
civil
side,
as
long
as
courts
of
the
states
were
effectuating
some
order,
hopefully
and
justice
on
the
criminal
side
the
legislation
included
a
provision
for
causes
of
action,
involving
indians
which
had
heretofore
been
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
state
court
jurisdiction
to
be
subject
to
adjudication
in
the
state
trial
courts.
the
language
of
the
statute,
we
think
is
of
critical
importance.
the
language
of
statute,
it
is
28
u.s.c.
1360
is
the
codification
of
the
statute,
after
the
clause,
indicating
which
states
would
mandatorily
be
subject
to
its
term
sets,
“following
states
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
between
indians
or
to
which
indians
are
parties,
which
arise
in
the
areas
of
indian
countries
listed”
and
then
the
statute
goes
on,
“and
those
civil
laws
of
such
state
or
territory
that
are
of
general
applications
to
private
persons
or
private
property
shall
have
the
same
force
and
effect
within
such
indian
country
as
they
had
elsewhere
in
the
state.”
now,
that
is
the
a-part
of
the
statutes.
c,
we
believe
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
a.
we
--
our
position
very
quickly
is,
that
this
is
a
cause
of
action,
this
is
a
lawyer’s
statute.
nobody
uses
words
causes
of
action
in
general
forums
because
somebody
is
going
to
say
laws
or
applicability,
you
are
subject
to
that
law
and
nobody
says
you
shall
have
a
cause
of
action
and
what
it
shall
be.
it
is
just
not
the
kind
of
language
most
people
would
use
unless
they
happen
to
be
trained
in
the
law
or
mis-trained
or
whatever.
but
the
c-section,
i
think
nails
down
that
cause
of
action
reading
of
section
a
and
that
is
the
last
line.
it
reaffirms
the
idea
that
the
tribal
governments
will
continue
to
have
authority
to
promulgate
ordinances
and
regulations
and
customs
which
will
govern
their
members
in
their
daily
lives
as
indians
on
the
reservation.
the
last
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
state
law
of
general
applicability
in
connection
with
causes
of
action,
yes
and
the
question
is
what
kind
of
laws
are
those?
our
position
is
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
i
think
that
is
the
only
way
to
read,
otherwise
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
c-section,
your
honor,
it
says
and
the
indian
law
shall
be
given
full
force
and
effect
in
the
determination
of
civil
causes
of
action
pursuant
to
this
section
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
is
correct,
but
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
determination.
that
determination
again
is
a
word
of
adjudication.
it
is
a
word
that
lawyers
use
for
adjudging,
you
know,
disputes
between
individuals.
the
argument
that
civil
laws
of
general
application
here
means
all
laws,
irrespective,
negates
the
whole
idea
of
causes
of
civil
--
of
cause
of
action
as
being
an
adjudicatory
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
is
correct,
but
it
would
have
what
we
would
call,
they
would
bring
us
--
they
could
bring
a
civil
action
against
you
for
to
foreclose
on
any
property
or
in
some
cases
depending
on
the
tax
where
judgment
for
those
taxes
is
correct
and
that
is
a
cause
of
action.
but
i
think
you
misread
--
this
statute
if
you
read
it
as
a
termination
statute
because
that
is
the
way
that
is
comes
out.
civil
cause
of
action
is
a
peculiar
word.
you
are
reading
it
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
as
termination
acts
have
been
read,
that
is
all
laws,
civil
and
criminal
shall
be
applicable.
our
reading
of
this
is
and
we
think
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
is
that
this
statute
talks
about
making
a
forum
for
adjudicating
disputes
between
indians
and
non-indians
available
on
the
reservation
where
they
had
heretofore
been
unavailable.
once
that
decision
to
afford
a
forum
has
been
made,
the
problem
arises
what
kind
of
law
is
applied
in
that
forum?
what
are
the
rules
or
decisions?
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
we
read
subsection
(b)
very
differently
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
mistake
that
the
minnesota
supreme
court
has
made.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
argues
a,
it
means
everything
goes
and
b
says
this
does
not
go
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
proper
reading.
b,
in
our
view
is
there
for
one
purpose.
it
is
there
in
the
criminal
sections
and
the
civil
sections.
it
is
there
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
the
indians
that
there
would
be
no
change
in
the
federal
trust
relationship
and
the
federal
trust
responsibility
and
the
fact
that
that
trust
property
taxes
are
referred
to
is
part
of
that
attempt
by
congress
to
assure
the
indians
that
this
would
work
no
change
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
not
necessarily.
i
think
you
--
that
that
is
the
simple
way
to
read
it,
but
i
think
we
are
reading
this
against
the
background
of
indian
legislation
in
which
prior
to
this
time,
there
had
been
no
authority
at
all.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
well,
that
is
certainly
would
be
one
way
of
doing
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
well,
is
that
--
we
argued
that
that
is
the
proper
reading
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
words
causes
of
action
combined
with
civil
laws
of
general
applicability
to
indicate
to
us
that
it
is
an
adjudicatory
section,
but
at
worst
or
at
best
if
you
will,
it
is
an
ambiguous
statute.
certainly,
it
is
not
easy
to
figure
out
exactly
what
it
means
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
nails
down
that
taxes
were
not
intended
to
be
authorized
by
the
a
portion
or
any
other
part
of
the
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
this
is
a
law
and
order
statute.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
those
states
that
were
possibly
coming
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
because
it
was
going
to
be
at
that
time
in
1953,
a
consent
feature,
a
number
of
them,
nevada
for
example,
refused
to
come
in.
they
refused
to
come
in
because
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
recoup
what
they
felt
was
their
cost
through
taxation
and
not
just
taxation
on
trust
properties.
there
is
discussions
in
the
legislative
history
about
taxation
on
sales
and
where
they
take
place
on
and
off
the
reservation
and
discussion
of
income
taxes
and
corporate
taxes
and
other
kinds
of
taxes.
and
it
is
--
if
anything
is
clear
from
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
on
the
discussions
is
that
nobody
conceives
this
statute
as
changing
in
one-eye
order,
the
tax
status
of
indian
reservations.
i
might
add
that
nobody
was
also
sure
what
the
tax
status
was
of
indian
reservations
until
1973.
so
in
a
sense,
that
is
an
additional
nail
to
the
idea
that
that
congress
was
not
sitting
there,
trying
to
figure
out
which
taxes
are
we
going
to
authorize,
which
are
we
not
going
to
authorize.
the
legislative
history
read
in
total,
seems
to
us
to
says
we
are
not
doing
anything
with
regard
to
taxes
on
this
and
b
is
in
there,
we
want
to
assure
you
that
the
trust
relationship
is
not
changing.
remember,
in
a
sense
this
statute
was
not
imposed
upon
the
indians.
the
indians
came
looking
for
the
statute.
the
government
indicates
the
indians
agreed.
it
was
not
a
matter
of
the
government
saying,
we
are
going
to
terminate
you.
we
are
going
to
impose
these
alien
courts
on
you.
there
was
agreement.
those
reservations
that
did
not
agree,
that
felt
that
they
had
adequate
law
and
order
situations,
that
felt
they
had
an
adequately
sophisticated
tribal
government,
the
red
lake
reservation,
the
warm
spring
reservation
in
ohio,
the
menomonee
reservation
in
wisconsin,
they
were
exempted
without
any
difficulty.
nobody
fought
about
it,
nobody
argued
about
it.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
them
arguing,
well,
we
want
to
be
outside
of
the
scope
of
taxes.
i
think
it
is
relatively
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
taxes
were
not
to
be
included.
agreed,
the
choice
of
language,
you
know,
is
not,
but
not
the
easiest
of
--
for
resolution
of
problems
that
could
arise.
i
do
not
--
we
do
not
deny
that.
there
would
have
been
better
ways
to
do
it,
but
the
fact
is
that
if
you
read
all
laws,
civil
and
criminal
into
this,
you
are
reading
it
in
the
face
of
contemporaneously
adopted
termination
statutes
which
accomplish
that
particular
end
and
you
are
making
this
statute
a
termination
act
because
under
the
statute
in
19
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
it
would
apply
that
--
of
to
a
large
part
of
tribal
life.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
misunderstand
the
statute.
the
statute
gave
a
1953
consent
to
every
state
in
the
union
to
assume
jurisdiction
unilaterally
under
the
statute.
that
was
not
changed
in
1968,
and
the
passage
of
the
indian
civil
rights
act
with
the
amendments,
the
public
law
280.
in
1953,
any
state
that
wanted
could
have
picked
up
jurisdiction
under
the
statute.
no
--
most
states
did
not,
no
fact
almost,
maybe
two
states
did
it,
and
they
were
not
out
in
the
middle
west
of
the
west
and
they
picked
it
up,
that
those
states
indeed
that
did
not
pick
it
up,
like
south
dakota
did
not
pick
it
up
because
of
the
tax
problem
because
they
felt
they
were
not
going
to
get
the
revenue
to
achieve
that
end.
the
discussion
is
relatively
clear
and
again,
i
think
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
costs,
whatever
cost
the
additions
of
the
court
services
and
there
is
a
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
that
this
is
dealing
with
court
services,
whatever
additional
cost
that
were
going
to
be
involved
in
this
would
have
to
be
borne
by
the
states.
that
congress
and
the
department
of
the
interior
was
not
going
to
put
in
additional
funds,
was
not
going
to
funds
this
as
a
separate
matter.
that
is
why
many
states
opted
out
and
i
think
that
that
was
the
intent.
it
is
clear
whether
the
language
may
not
be
sufficient,
we
agree,
but
it
is
clearly
unclear
language
where
the
legislative
history
has
to
provide
the
backdrop
for
reading
it,
otherwise
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
is
correct.
the
statute
was
adopted
in
conjunction
with
the
indians.
there
was
--
the
government
and
the
indians
did
want
a
consent
feature
in
the
bill.
in
the
original,
some
of
the
original
drafts
of
the
bill
had
a
consent
feature.
in
other
words,
the
tribes
will
have
to
consent
with
the
state.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
in
the
initial
--
for
the
initial
states,
each
--
the
department
of
the
interior
indicated
that
they
had
conversations
with
both
the
state
governments
and
the
tribes
in
those
states
and
that
on
the
five
mandatory
states,
there
was
agreement,
except
for
the
reservations
that
were
exempted,
red
lake,
warm
springs
and
menominee.
as
far
as
the
remaining
states
of
the
union,
who
had
any
indian
country,
as
that
is
defined
by
the
statutes
within
it,
the
statute
as
finally
enacted
by
the
congress
in
1953
had
not
--
did
not
have
a
mandatory
indian
consent
feature.
there
had
been
a
consent
feature
in
one
draft
and
then
a
consultation
provision
and
that
was
dropped
out
eventually
on
the
theory
that
there
would
have
to
be
consultation
anyway,
which
in
effect
occurred
i
think.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
thank
you,
your
honor.
with
my
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
question
a
little
more
on
the
consent
feature,
in
1968,
congress
changed
the
consent
feature
of
the
statute
to
make
it
mandatory
that
the
tribes’
consent
to
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
they
did
not
alter
the
language
of
the
civil
section
or
the
criminal
section
at
all.
so
that
whatever
the
meaning
or
reading
was
in
1953
would
be
the
same
in
1968.
it
seems
to
me
almost
beyond
understanding
to
--
for
the
congress
to
expect
the
tribes
voluntarily
to
consent
to
coming
under
--
the
lower
courts
held
it
would
be
essentially
total
state
jurisdiction,
if
in
fact
that
would
subject
their
members
for
the
full
panoply
of
state
taxes.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
is
correct,
your
honor
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
--
and
that
is
why
i
think
the
reading
that
the
lower
court,
the
state
give
this
indicate
that
congress
somehow
went
through
and
understood
what
the
tax
situation
was
and
indicated
that
that
ought
to
pass
to
the
states
as
well.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
history
and
knowing
that
that
question
is
unclear
and
it
was
only
partially
settled
in
1973
that
there
was
no
discussion
one
way
or
another
about
taxes
and
taxes
as
a
concept
as
an
idea
were
accepted
from
this
statute.
the
statute
basically
has
nothing
to
do
with
taxes.
the
b
proviso,
which
appears
both
on
the
criminal
side
and
on
the
civil
side
seems
to
us
is
the
kind
of
a
provision
that
was
put
in
there
to
assuage
as
we
indicated
the
indian
fears
that
there
was
any
change
in
the
trust
relationship
and
secondly,
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
put
that
in
on
a
criminal
side.
why
would
you
put
a
statute
that
says,
exactly
as
it
does
on
the
civil
side,
no
taxes
on
trust
property,
no
alienation
of
land
when
we
are
talking
about
offense,
criminal
offense
jurisdiction.
for
the
most
part,
that
would
not
arise.
the
authority
to
the
tax
if
it
came
would
not
come
from
the
authority
over
the
criminal
section,
it
would
become
because
of
all
civil
laws
being
applicable
and
somebody
fails
to
pay
and
the
failure
to
pay
maybe
a
criminal
offense.
but
the
authority
would
come
from
the
civil
side
and
yet
that
appears
throughout
the
statute,
which
indicates
to
me,
it
was,
i
do
not
want
to
call
it
a
congressional,
whatever,
but
a
provision
that
appears
in
other
places
as
well
to
make
it
clear
to
the
indians
that
they
are
not
changing
their
status
vis-a-vis
the
federal
government.
now,
the
way
that
state
courts
have
read
that
is
b
in
fact,
turns
out
to
be
the
section
by
which
you
find
the
authority.
suppose
congress
had
not
put
b
in
there,
they
had
said
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
assuaging
any
of
the
fears,
there
is
nothing
to
have
to
fear,
alright,
and
they
took
b
out
and
they
did
not
put
it
in,
all
you
have
is
the
a
section,
it
would
be
awful
tough
to
read
that
as
conveying
taxing
authority.
the
only
way
the
state
courts
read
it
is
by
coming
back
in
through
b
and
saying
well,
then
why
did
they
put
b
in
if
a
did
not
convey
general
taxing
authority.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
well,
i
think
that
they
relied
very
heavily
on
b
as
indicating
their
reading
of
a,
that
is
correct
and
without
b
being
there
that
they
would
have
read
a
very
possibly
as
not
conveying
the
taxing
authority.
by
putting
in
b,
and
in
our
view
of
the
congress
put
in
b
there
as
a
help,
as
a
method
of
persuading
or
assuring
the
indians
that
they
would
not
be
changed
in
their
status
vis-a-vis
the
federal,
but
that
their
trust
relationship,
the
historic
federal
trust
responsibility
would
not
be
altered
at
all.
all
that
was
happening
is
they
were
now
getting
a
forum
for
adjudication
of
criminal
matters
and
civil
matters,
which
is
what
they
wanted.
now,
to
come
in
and
to
say
congress
by
putting
in
b
and
telling
them
now
that
we
are
going
to
not
change
anything,
has
in
fact
slipped
one
by
the
indians.
they
slipped
it
by
because
by
putting
in
b,
you
read
that
as
mini
a,
conveys
general
taxing
authority
to
the
extent
that
b
does
not
exempt
it
and
i
think
that
is
an
awful
burden
to
put
on
the
congress
in
terms
of
its
general
methodology
of
supposedly
dealing
with
indians
with
some
degree
of
good
faith.
i
think
the
only
way
to
read
that
a,
b
the
way
the
state
and
the
lower
court
does
is
in
fact,
it
was
either
inadvertent
which
i
doubt
or
was
slipped
by
the
tribes
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
true
at
all.
the
tribes
agreed.
they
know
what
was
happening
to
a
degree.
by
the
statute,
the
language
is
not
very
good,
we
all
agree,
that
the
language
of
civil
causes
of
action
in
general
law
is
not
the
kind
of
the
best
kind
of
language
and
someone
is
going
to
have
to
make
sense
of
it
while
it
still
stands,
but
the
one
thing
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
it
did
was
convey
general
taxing
authority.
another
matter
i
would
like
to
raise
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
well,
that
of
course,
is
one
of
the
key
problems.
i
do
not
know
completely
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
that
arguments
can
be
made
in
given
cases
that
certain
other
clients
of
regulatory
powers
over
matters
that
are
peculiarly
involved
with
tribal
life
may
not
be
conveyed,
but
i
have
nothing
on
which
to
work
in
this
case.
this
case
deals
with
taxes
and
taxes
have
always
been
treated
as
a
special
case
under
federal
laws.
the
mcclanahan,
mescalero,
there
is
always
been
this
special
taxing
jurisdiction
requirements.
congress
has
to
expressly
convey
the
authority.
no
other
way
to
explain
squire
versus
capoeman,
expect
by
virtue
of
a
special
kind
of
taxing
statute
reading
rule,
if
you
will,
with
regard
to
indians.
so
on
that
side,
i
think
the
tax
part
of
it
is
clear.
what
else
is
involved,
i
think
is
going
to
have
wait
for
some
adjudication
to
take
place
and
one
of
the
reasons
it
has
not
taken
place
interestingly
enough
is
because
the
states
i
think
only
rather
recently
caught
on
to
the
effect
that
taxes
may
have
been
of
the
things
included.
this
is
the
first
case
on
280
directly
to
reach
this
court.
there
is
only
two
other
cases
on
280,
you
know,
both
of
them
deal
with
this
issue
one
way
or
the
other.
the
lower
court
opinion
here
in
the
peters
case.
the
rest
of
it
are,
you
know,
references
here
and
there
in
kennerly
and
a
couple
of
other
cases
of
280,
but
there
has
been
very
little
litigation
over
280
and
it
is
only
been
very
recent
that
the
states,
from
what
we
have
been
out
gather,
had
been
attempting
to
assert
this
new
found
taxing
authority.
indeed,
i
would
venture
to
say,
it
might
be
contemporaneous
with
the
mcclanahan
and
mescalero
decisions.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
arouse,
that
arouse
in
a
very
different
kind
of
situation
i
think
it
is
--
tonasket.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
tonasket
versus
washington,
yes,
which
was
remanded
back
and
there
was
a
change
of
statute
there.
there
was
a
tax
imposed,
an
attempt
to
impose
the
collecting
tax
for
cigarettes
on
an
indian
seller
selling
to
non-indians
and
the
question
is
not,
like
here
you
are
talking
about
taxing
an
indian
on
a
home
that
he
lives
on
and
it
is
quiet
a
bit
different.
the
question
is
whether
non-indians
who
might
buy
cigarettes
would
be
subject
to
the
state's
tax
law
whether
through
some
means
or
rather
the
state
could
compel
the
indian
to
pre-collect
that
tax.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
was
280.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
is
correct,
to
a
degree.
the
state
and
the
tribe
had
worked
out
the
280
arrangement
there
between
them
and
only
certain
areas
were
conveyed
and
certain
areas,
they
did
it
a
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
right.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
is
a
good
possibility.
you
had
the
moe
case
before
you.
it
was
recently
argued
in
which
that
issue
came
up
was
the
280
question
would
not
be
applicable
to
the
collection.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
our
position
is
that
as
far
as
the
pre-collection
and
imposing
the
state
law
obligation
to
pre-collect
on
the
indians
that
the
answer
is
yes.
that
might
be
the
same
irrespective
of
280
on
any
reservation.
that
is
the
different
matter.
one
more
point
i
would
like
to
make
before
i
reserve
some
time
and
that
is
this.
there
is
a
narrower
way
to
decide
this
case.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
said,
it
was
not
raised
properly.
i
think
that
is
a
mistake
in
view
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
attorney
general
has
indicated
that
the
question
of
whether
this
is
personal
property
was
for
some
reason
rather
not
raised.
the
only
question
that
did
not
appear
to
be
raised
from
the
record
in
the
trial
court
was
the
question
of
this
was
personal
property
attached
to
the
land
for
purposes
of
minnesota’s
land
tax
exemption
for
indian
land,
we
have
that
in
our
statute,
it
is
in
the
appendix.
the
question
here
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
the
question
is
how
is
280,
a
federal
statute
read
which
is
a
federal
question,
the
question
being
does
the
b
proviso
of
280
about
regulation
of
indian
trust
land
also
mean
that
an
indian
who
buys
a
mobile
home
because
he
is
not
rich
enough
to
put
a
foundation
and
a
concrete
in
the
ground
and
most
of
--
the
15%
of
the
tribe
in
our
state
uses
mobile
homes
because
that
is
the
only
thing
that
they
can
afford
over
for
housing.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
well,
that
is
yes.
how
much
mobility?
then
you
get
into
--
one
of
the
problems
is,
you
get
into
how
much,
if
you
take
the
state's
point
of
view,
you
get
in
to
how
much
is
attached?
how
many
concrete
posts
do
we
have
to
put
in
before
it
is
attached?
how
many
sewer
lines,
do
we
need
a
sewer
connected
to
outside
sewer?
what
about
cesspool
or
drain
field
or
any
of
the
local
kinds
of
the
sewers,
the
treatment
proposals
used.
our
problem
is
that
b
we
think
clearly
treats
this
as
it
would
a
home.
the
only
--
otherwise,
you
end
up
with
the
rather
absurd
reading
that
an
indian
who
was
wealthy
enough
and
i
do
not
want
to
make
this
an
emotional,
but
it
does
seem
to
follow,
an
indian
who
builds
a
home,
has
sufficient
income
to
build
a
home
however
small
and
put
a
foundation
in,
he
is
home
free
because
his
property
cannot
be
taxed,
there
is
no
question.
but
an
indian
who
buys
a
mobile
home,
you
know,
then
has
to
be
judged
by
the
number
of
bricks
or
blocks
underneath
the
home
to
determine
whether
it
is
attached.
now,
we
do
not
think
the
federal
law
requires
that.
we
think
b
protects
in
that
instance
any
kind
of
a
thing,
if
you
will,
used
as
a
home
on
the
trust
land.
it
flows
with
part
of
the
government's
guarantee
when
they
set
that
reservation
apart
in
1855.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
respond
to
a
number
of
things.
as
far
as
the
gasoline
and
sales
tax,
the
buck
act
passed
by
congress
a
number
of
years
ago,
authorizes
the
imposition
and
collection
of
both
sales
and
gasoline
taxes
on
indian
reservations
and
other
federal
enclaves,
multi-reservations.
the
sales
act
is
not
all
clear
as
to
whether
the
sales
act
part
of
it
makes
it
applicable
to
indians
buying
from
traders
or
non-indians.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
absent
280,
in
a
sale
to
an
indian,
clearly
no.
the
question
is
still
open
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
despite
the
buck
act.
as
far
as
the
--
on
the
point,
i
would
like
to
--
as
far
as
red
lake
is
concerned,
i
think
red
lake
and
warm
springs
and
menominee
was
specifically
exempted
up
because
they
did
have
on-going
tribal
governments
and
they
were
--
if
the
idea
is
that
this
statute
should
be
read
against
an
assimilationist,
terminationist
background,
then
you
would
think
that
congress
would
pick
for
termination
and
assimilation
those
tribes
that
had
advanced
over
the
peopleage
state,
which
was,
you
know
the
concept
in
kagama
and
the
older
cases
is
what
the
government
was
supposed
to
be
doing.
yet
in
fact,
it
was
only
that
the
tribes
and
the
areas
where
the
tribes
were
least
developed,
where
there
was
less
involvement
that
280
was
made
mandatorily
applicable
and
the
reservations
that
will
further
this
advance
will
have
the
greatest
assets,
menominee
and
warm
springs
were
exempted
from
the
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
my
problem
is
i
do
not
--
i
am
not
even
sure
you
can
necessarily
read
this
as,
you
know,
a
terminationist
statute.
you
could
--
obviously
the
house
concurrent
resolution
108
was
there,
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
to
make
it
go
away,
you
know.
but
this
statute
itself,
you
know,
was
something
significantly
less
than
a
terminationist,
assimilationist
statute.
one
can
make
the
argument
that
it
was
designed
to
help
the
tribal
governments
along
over
a
difficult
period
by
allowing
the
c
provision
and
authorizing
the
courts
as
vehicles
for
bringing
about
some
level
of
order,
so
that
some
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
that
it
did.
it
made
state
courts
available.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
it
worked
a
major
change,
but
i
do
not
think
it
worked
a
major
change
of
subjecting
the
indians
to
state
taxes,
the
full
panoply
of
state
taxes.
that
would
have
generated
an
awful
lot
of
opposition
from
an
awful
lot
of
tribes
and
it
just
does
not
come
up
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
well,
they
have
been
fighting
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
of
course,
they
have
been
fighting
on
that
for
a
while.
that
have
never
given
in
on
that
subject
--
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
wholly
unsettled
and
unclear,
however,
by
no
means
acquiesced
in
by
the
indians.
they
have
been
fighting
that
issue.
it
is
just
that
never
reached
this
court.
there
have
been
a
number
of
state
court
decisions.
mr.
bernard
p.
becker
yes.
