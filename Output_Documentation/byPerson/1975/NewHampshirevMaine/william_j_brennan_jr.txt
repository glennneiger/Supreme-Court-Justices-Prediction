justice
jr.
is
there
any
question
of
the
validity
of
the
executive
of
new
hampshire,
or
i
should
ask,
(inaudible)
question
of
state
law,
may
have
been
in
agreement
of
this
kind
without
full
legislature?
justice
jr.
you
can
conclude
that
the
two
parties
were
mistaken
in
their
agreement
that
this
was
indeed
a
thalweg?
justice
jr.
the
fact
that
you
consented
to
it
would
not
conclude
us
from
saying
…
justice
jr.
this
was
not
the
thalweg.
justice
jr.
the
consent
agreement
should
be
rejected,
if
what
is
to
be
determined.
the
resolution
of
the
boundary
dispute
is
the
drawing
15:36.
justice
jr.
(inaudible)enter
it.
justice
jr.
would
we
not
have
to
agree
that
this
indeed
is
in
law
of
the
thalweg?
justice
jr.
does
the
basis
for
the
agreement,
falls
out,
the
agreement
falls
at.
justice
jr.
there
was
not
your
legislature
approval
--
justice
jr.
like
my
brother
rehnquist
just
suggested
--
it
is
a
public
interest
--
the
court
just
had
the
problem
--
justice
jr.
we
would
agree
with
you.
would
that
mean
in
respect
to
relocating
the
geographic
middle?
justice
jr.
if
we
were
to
agree
on
geographic
middle,
are
you
suggesting
that
on
this
record
that
would
be
inappropriate
without
maine
having
a
further
opportunity,
to
have
a
determination
of
inland
waters?
justice
jr.
is
that
what
you
are
arguing?
justice
jr.
what
relevance
this
determination
of
inland
waters
have
on
the
determination
of
geographic
middle?
justice
jr.
you
said,
you
might
be
able
to
persuade
them
to
the
contrary
as
to
the
closing
line,
which
then
would
have
an
effect
on
the
location
of
the
geographic
middle?
justice
jr.
what
is
it
you
wanted
to
know?
justice
jr.
we
disagree
with
the
principles
on
which
the
consent
agreement.

the
other
case
is
an
original
action,
no.
64
original,
brought
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
against
the
state
of
maine
to
locate
the
lateral
boundary
separating
the
states
between
the
mouth
of
portsmouth
harbor
and
the
entrance
to
gosport
harbor
in
the
isles
of
shoals.
now
that
boundary
had
in
fact
been
fixed
by
a
decree
236
odd
years
old
of
king
george
ii
of
england,
but
the
states
weren’t
sure
exactly
where
it
was
located.
in
this
proceeding
before
--
it
came
to
trial
before
the
special
master,
the
states
agreed
on
that
location
and
they
submitted
a
consent
decree,
fixing
the
location.
the
special
master
thought
that
a
consent
decree
should
be
entered
provided
its
entry
was
consistent
with
this
court’s
article
iii
functions
in
cases
of
this
character.
for
reasons
expressed
in
an
opinion
we
have
filed,
we
think
that
the
entry
of
that
decree
does
comport
with
our
article
iii
functions
and
therefore
direct
the
entry
of
the
consent
decree.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
stevens
join.
