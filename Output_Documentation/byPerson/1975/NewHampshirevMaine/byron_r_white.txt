that
is
what
you
agreed.
justice
white
(inaudible)
is
there
any
question
in
the
case,
i
noticed
new
hampshire
is
not
quite
happy
with
our
recent
(inaudible)
perhaps
it
was
a
time
of
dismay,
but
new
hampshire
legislature
never
did
agree
with
the
agreement,
did
it?
justice
white
but
it
does
not
mean
where
mainer’s
sail
does
it?
thalweg
means
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel?
justice
white
it
is
a
principle
or
you
think
that
the
geographic
middle
is
the
right
…
justice
white
is
it
your
position
or
what
is
you
position?
do
you
think
that
determination
would
preclude
or
did
preclude
the
two
states
from
an
agreement?
justice
white
having
decided
that
the
geographic
middle
is
the
correct
legal
principle
historically
in
this
situation,
do
you
think
that
the
states
were
then,
disentitled
to
agree
otherwise?
justice
white
this
function
would
have
some
finite
limits
in
the
sense
that
when
he
finished
marking
that
would
be
the
end
of
his
job.
justice
white
it
would
then
require
any
on-going
judicial
supervision
or
enforcement.
justice
white
i
will
disagree
with
you
on
that.
justice
white
on
the
principles
on
which
you
have
based
the
consent
decree.
justice
white
(inaudible)
for
the
special
master,
did
you?
justice
white
and,
i
suppose
the
purpose
for
stipulating
it
was
to
help
him
in
determining
whether
he
should
accept
or
reject
your
consent
decree.
justice
white
you
do
not
think
that
there
is
enough
on
the
record
for
the
master
to
have
not
only
rejected
the
consent
decree
and
do
have
said,
“i
will
not
accept
the
thalweg
as
the
principle
for
division.”
but
to
go
on
and
say
that
the
proper
principle
is
the
middle
of
the
river.
