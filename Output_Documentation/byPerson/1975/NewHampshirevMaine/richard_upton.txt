mr.
richard
upton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
am
going
for
new
hampshire,
i
would
like
first
to
touch
on
a
sole
exception
to
the
master’s
report
and
then,
answer
the
argument
just
made
by
mr.
bradley
regarding
the
consent
decree.
now,
the
question
of
law
presented
by
new
hampshire's
sole
exception
is
this,
was
the
master
correct,
in
ruling
that
it
was
proper
for
him
to
use
low
tide
elevations,
that
is
rocks
protruding
only
at
low
tide
in
piscataqua
river,
as
points
of
reference
from
which
to
calculate
the
geographic
middle
of
the
river?
and,
we
argue
that
this
ruling
is
incorrect,
the
use
of
low
tide
elevation.
mr.
richard
upton
yes,
you
honor.
mr.
richard
upton
you
honor
that
is
our
position.
mr.
richard
upton
but,
the
geographic
middle,
we
believe
he
is
correct
in
this
ruling.
but,
we
think
he
has
located
it
improperly.
mr.
richard
upton
we
do
and
in
my
reply
brief
i
have
argued
the
point
strongly
as
i
know
how
with
citations
to
the
proceedings
of
the
boundary
commissioners
in
the
appendix.
so,
we
have
only
one
complaint
with
the
map
…
mr.
richard
upton
i
think
that.
--
your
honor,
the
agreement
was
based
in
an
entirely
different
concept
of
law.
counsel
were
dealing
then
in
terms
of
the
thalweg
and
trying
to
agree
as
a
matter
of
convenience.
mr.
richard
upton
i
think,
now
we
got
the
master’s
findings
on
that
we
never
tried
to
agree
on
this
point
in
our
agreement.
we
never
covered
this
in
our
negotiations.
mr.
richard
upton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
upton
that
is
our
position.
and
so,
we
argue
that
he
was
incorrect
in
calculating
and
locating
the
geographic
middle
of
the
river
in
using
these
low
tide
elevations
and
in
particular,
a
submerged
rock
of
whaleback
reef.
this
is
the
one
thing
which
distorts
the
situation
so
much,
because
whale
back
reef
is
a
tiny
rock,
1/3
of
the
way
out
into
the
river.
it
does
not
qualify
as
an
island.
it
cannot
be
assimilated
to
the
coast
as
an
island.
any
of
the
tests
this
court
has
adopted
in
united
states
versus
louisiana,
394
us
recently,
it
is
a
distortion
of
geography
to
say
that
is
part
of
the
bank
of
a
river
at
low
tide
elevation.
mr.
richard
upton
number
three
you
honor,
the
black
ink
is
the
whaleback
reef,
figure
3,
just
to
the
left
of
the
line
marked,
closing
line
of
harbor.
mr.
richard
upton
no,
but
we
are
informed
that
the
master
--
see
in
the
footnote
on
pages
42
and
43
of
the
master’s
report,
bottom
of
page
42.
the
way
a
median
line
is
calculated
it
is
a
ground
x
of
the
compass
to
the
nearest
points.
he
says
the
significant
points
in
piscataqua
harbor
are
those
low
tide
elevations
and
low
water
lines
on
either
side
of
the
harbor
that
are
nearest
to
each
other.
and,
he
mentions
whaleback
reef
there,
that
he
did
use
that
as
a
point
of
reference
in
calculating
the
median
line.
we
say
that
was
error,
that
particular
--
mr.
richard
upton
no,
you
honor.
he
uses
it
as
a
point
of
reference
in
calculating
the
median
line
of
the
river.
mr.
richard
upton
if
i
am
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
as
the
court
can
see
…
mr.
richard
upton
350
yards,
it
makes
a
difference,
because
it
deflects
the
straight
line
boundary
all
the
way
from
there
up
to
the
isle
of
shoals,
a
distance
of
6
miles.
the
deflection
of
that
line
at
that
point,
350
yards
makes
a
difference
of
300
acres
to
new
hampshire
over
the
whole
area.
mr.
richard
upton
no,
they
are
not.
they
converge,
your
honor
at
one
point
at
the
isle
of
shoals.
it
is
a
long
v-shape
gore.
mr.
richard
upton
as
i
view
it,
the
master’s
report
is
entitled
to
a
strong
presumption
of
correctness.
mr.
richard
upton
if
he
committed
an
error
of
law,
of
course
questions
of
law
may
always
be
corrected
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
upton
i
say
your
honor,
that
it
is
contrary
to
any
of
the
precedent
in
the
national
law
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
its
contrary
to
the
holdings
of
all,
the
writers
in
this
field
we
have
cited
in
pages
7
to
9
about
brief
and
it
is
contrary
to
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
louisiana.
mr.
richard
upton
your
honor,
one
of
the
tests
they
use
is
that
proposed
by
mr.
badge,
a
former
geographer
of
the
state
department
to
draw
a
parallel
lines
at
the
end
of
each
off
shore
formation
to
the
shore
and
if
the
amount
of
water
area
between
the
island
or
off
shore
formation
and
the
shore
is
greater
than
the
off
shore
formation,
then
it
cannot
be
assimilated
to
the
shore
and
used
as
a
point
of
reference.
now,
in
this
situation,
this
is
obviously
too
small
and
too
far
to
move
from
the
shore
to
qualify
in
to
that
task.
and,
i
understand
that
approach
is
almost
a
question
of
law.
both
parties
are
having
their
briefs
gone
farther
than
to
argue,
merely
the
point
of
whether
the
measurement
should
be
made
from
these
off
shore
formations,
whether
they
are
properly
part
of
the
bank
or
the
river,
which
one
should
measure.
and,
we
have
gone
into
the
analogy
of
various
articles
of
the
geneva
convention
of
the
territorial
sea.
now,
we
have
may
complicate
matters
by
doing
this,
but
we
feel
obliged
to
go
into
it,
because
the
master
did
and
he
used
it
to
justify
what
he
had
done
here.
i
think
it
all
stems
from
article
12
of
the
geneva
convention
of
1958,
which
states
that
the
territorial
sea
outside
of
internal
waters
should
be
divided
between
states,
whose
coastlines
are
adjacent
by
median
line
principle,
measured
from
the
nearest
points
on
each
state’s
base
line.
the
masters
apparently
applied
this
analogy
to
internal
waters,
because
we
are
here
in
internal
waters,
inside
the
closing
line
of
the
harbor,
whether
one
looks
at
it
by
maine's
standpoint
or
by
new
hampshire’s
standpoint,
but
i
urge
to
the
court
that
if
we
ought
to
apply
this
analogy
of
international
law
to
internal
waters,
it
ought
to
be
done
with
extreme
care
and
with
an
eye
to
the
real
purposes
of
the
convention.
to
do
it,
we
have
to
consider
maine
and
new
hampshire
as
foreign
states.
having
opposing
coastlines
on
each
side
of
the
river,
but
this
is
a
very
narrow
river.
it
is
a
little
over
a
mile-and-a-half
wide
at
the
mouth
and
it
narrows
down
as
we
go
further
inland.
now,
how
would
coastal
baselines
be
drawn
on
each
side
of
the
river
from
which
to
measure
the
median
line
or
boundary?
now,
we
say
that
if
this
analogy
is
to
be
followed
at
all,
article
3
should
be
used.
that
is
the
normal
baseline
follows
the
low
water
line
on
the
maine
land.
that
islands
should
only
be
considered
part
of
the
shore
if
they
qualify
under
the
tests
of
the
united
states
versus
louisiana,
that
is
their
size
and
closeness,
makes
them
really
an
integral
part
of
the
maine
land
and
that
the
use
of
low
tide
elevations
that
is
rocks
exposed
only
at
low
tide
as
part
of
the
baseline
is
optional
under
international
law
and
to
use
these
as
measuring
points
in
such
close
waters
is
apt
to
create
distortion
and
unequal
division
waters
of
the
river
and
that
is
just
what
it
would
do
if
this
happens.
i
think
it
is
demonstrated.
at
the
very
least,
a
low
tide
elevation
should
not
have
more
influence
than
an
island,
but
if
the
master
is
correct,
he
would
be
giving
it
that
effect.
and,
we
say
that
was
his
principle
error,
otherwise
we
have
no
objection
with
his
report.
now,
maine
is
referred
to
article
4
of
the
convention,
which
is
an
optional
method
of
drawing
long
straight
baselines.
it
is
optional
not
mandatory
and
it
was
fathered
by
the
decision
of
the
international
court
of
justice
in
the
anglo-norwegian
fisheries
case
in
1951.
it
is
optional;
it
applies
to
the
peculiar
coastline
that
was
found
of
norway
with
many
deeply
intended
fiords.
it
is
not
appropriate
to
apply
by
analogy
to
closely
bounded
internal
waters
and
the
decision
was
never
accepted
by
the
united
states
government.
in
fact,
a
law
was
advocated
by
california,
it
was
not
followed
in
united
states
versus
california.
and,
to
use
this
method
and
to
use
whaleback
reef
would
cause
much
more
than
a
15
percent
departure
from
the
general
direction
of
the
maine
shore,
which
was
the
maximum
thought
permissible
in
the
anglo-norwegian
case.
now,
turning
to
the
point
that
occupied
the
court’s
attention,
when
maine
was
arguing,
the
rejection
of
the
motion
for
entry
of
judgment
by
consent,
was
the
master
correct
in
rejecting
it?
and,
is
new
hampshire's
present
position
in
support
of
the
master
correct?
we
believe
the
master
gave
sound
and
adequate
reasons
for
recommending
rejection
of
the
consent
decree
and
we
have
not
taken
any
exception
to
this
ruling.
the
motion
for
entry
of
judgment,
by
consent,
and
i
took
part
in
it,
was
an
effort
by
the
two
states
to
get
a
comprised
settlement.
frankly,
a
compromised
settlement
approved.
it
had
to
become
a
judgment
of
this
court
or
it
would
do
us
no
good,
because
our
state
had
already
unilaterally
adopted
a
boundary
line
in
consistent
with
anything
maine
would
agree
to
and
our
legislature
had
provided
that
this
shall
be
the
line
governing
all
public
offices
of
new
hampshire
unless
and
until
modified
by
a
compact
or
by
judgment
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
upton
that
one,
you
honor,
was
a
law,
which
passed
and
was
approved
by
the
governor,
the
one
i
just
quoted.
and,
that
was
passed
before
we
entered
in
to
this
compromised
agreement
and
was
signed
by
the
governor
and
it
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
richard
upton
that
was
the
next
section
of
that
chapter,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
upton
we
felt
that
it
could
only
be
made
consistent
your
honor,
if
this
court
approved
it
and
adopted
it
and
made
it
a
judgment
of
this
court
and
that
case
it
came
within
the
exception
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
upton
that
is
correct
your
honor,
the
matter
rests
in
the
hands
of
this
court
at
this
moment,
because
you
do
have
the
power,
i
believe
if
you
find
that
as
a
law
to
enter
the
consent
decree.
mr.
richard
upton
that
is
true,
although
in
the
case
of
a
personal
entry
case,
the
parties
have
the
power
to
make
such
a
settlement
without
the
intervention
of
the
court.
they
could
just
…
mr.
richard
upton
in
that
case,
i
have
to
confess
it
requires
the
approval
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
upton
this
problem
always
exists
and
i
suppose
it
exists
in
a
criminal
case,
where
a
man
pleads
guilty
and
counsel
attempted
to
work
out
an
arrangement
as
to
what
the
recommendations
will
be
for
senates.
it
is
placed
before
the
court.
the
court
may
or
may
not
accept
it.
it
may
impose
a
harsher
penalty
or
a
lesser
penalty,
but
the
matter
is
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
upton
your
honor,
i
take
this
to
be
the
position
regarding
contract
that
if
this
is
not
to
become
a
judgment
of
this
court,
then
it
must
be
a
compact,
which
requires
the
consent
of
the
united
states
congress
in
order
to
be
binding
on
the
states,
because
this
court
is
several
times
held
the
resolution
of
boundary
disputes
between
states
falls
within
the
compact
clause.
if
the
case
is
not
settled
by
a
judgment
of
this
court,
that
would
be
my
answer.
this
was
frankly
a
compromise,
on
which
we
needed
the
court’s
approval,
but
at
the
time
we
did
this,
we
are
unaware
of
what
your
honor’s
are
going
to
hold
in
new
york
versus
vermont
or
vermont
versus
new
york,
that
decision
came
down
in
the
summer,
at
the
time
these
negotiations
were
going
on.
now,
we
compromised
in
these
ways.
the
thalweg
versus
the
geographical
middle,
new
hampshire
accepted
the
thalweg
and
then
we
further
compromised
on
thalweg
by
deciding
we
would
agree,
it
was
a
straight
line.
when
in
fact
of
course,
it
cannot
be
physically,
but
for
convenience
of
law
enforcement,
we
agreed
that
it
was
the
thalweg
and
that
was
it.
secondly,
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
for
determining
the
point,
where
the
thalweg
ended,
we
agreed
was
a
line
going
from
odion’s
point
to
a
submerged
rock
called,
kitsch
rock,
which
has
a
whistling
boy
on
it.
this
again,
was
an
arbitrary
compromise
administrative
convenience,
but
it
has
no
relation
to
law
that
applies
to
tell
where
the
harbor’s
mouth
is.
and
finally,
we
agreed
that
the
line
across
the
open
sea
would
be
a
straight
line,
rather
than
a
curved
line,
as
sought
by
maine,
based
on
the
united
states
geological
survey
maps.
and
here,
the
master
has
found
that
we
adopted
correct
law,
the
straight
line
is
proper
under
the
special
circumstances
exception
of
the
geneva
convention.
now,
when
the
terms
of
this
settlement
were
proposed
to
the
master,
he
told
us
now
he
now
doubted
that
he
had
the
power
to
accept
it.
although
he
had
earlier
urged
just
to
settle.
mr.
richard
upton
yes,
your
honor.
and,
we
held
a
hearing
on
that,
it
appeared
likely
that
he
might
rule
to
accept
it,
he
might
accept
it
with
modifications,
he
might
reject
it
and
call
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
full
or
he
might
proceed
to
decide
the
case,
either
for
new
hampshire
or
for
maine.
on
the
record
we
made
far,
because
when
we
knew
about
vermont
versus
new
york
we
tried
to
repair
the
situation
by
presenting
the
master
with
a
stipulation
for
an
evidentiary
record,
which
is
reported
in
full
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
record.
so,
he
would
have
something
by
which
to
judge
the
lawfulness
and
reasonableness
of
the
stipulation.
now,
he
recommended
rejection,
he
thought
we
were
presenting
him
with
a
fait
accompli
which
he
would
merely
rubber
stamp
and
which
did
not
call
for
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power,
that
is
applying
established
principles
of
law
to
facts,
which
either
have
been
stipulated
to
or
settled
by
the
evidence.
he
felt
that
this
was
not
kind
of
a
thing.
he
had
been
presented
with
something
that
was
not
judicial
in
nature
and
not
proper
basis
for
a
judgment.
he
then,
found
that
the
record
we
have
stipulated
to
before
him,
as
a
basis
for
deciding
the
case
was
sufficient
for
him
to
make
a
decision
on
the
merits
without
further
hearings.
and,
he
then
proceeded
to
decide,
as
my
brother
bradley
has
outlined
in
his
opening
statement.
now,
we
believe
that
the
master
was
correct
in
adopting
geographic
middle
as
opposed
to
thalweg.
we
compromised
that
position
in
the
beginning,
in
order
to
obtain
what
we
thought
was
doubtful
that
is
a
straight
line
across
the
open
sea,
which
we
felt
was
very
important
to
us.
mr.
richard
upton
e,
you
honor
was
the
point
we
agreed
on
in
the
consent
decree
as
being
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
and
the
end
of
the
thalweg.
mr.
richard
upton
i
believe
my
brother
means
that
c
is
the
line
drawn
by
the
master.
c
to
d,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
upton
that
is
right
your
honor
and
the
reason
that
…
mr.
richard
upton
cd,
as
the
line
found
by
the
masters.
cef
is
the
consent
decree
and
we
extended
the
thalweg
out
to
e,
which
is
a
point
we
agreed
in
the
stipulation
would
be
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
and
then
we
took
off
across
the
c.
mr.
richard
upton
yes
your
honor,
and
then
we
stipulated
that
would
be
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
by
arbitrarily
drawing
a
line
from
odion’s
point
across
the
kitsch
rock
whistling
boy
that
location.
mr.
richard
upton
as
we
go
out
to
c
and
this
is
where
the
biggest
trouble
of
enforcement
is,
your
honor.
we
would
ask
maine
to
participate
with
us
in
putting
range
lights
on
new
castle
island,
one
behind
the
others
lined
up
with
this
line.
and,
we
have
asked
the
court
to
--
justice
clark
has
recommended
to
the
court
that
a
commissioner
be
appointed
to
mark
the
line,
when
the
report
becomes
final.
this
has
been
done
in
most
of
the
boundary
cases.
it
was
done
in
vermont
versus
new
hampshire
after
the
court
had
adopted
the
law
and
decided
how
it
applied.
a
commissioner
was
appointed
to
mark
points
on
land
with
the
agreement
with
states
and
we
think
this
would
be
appropriate
here.
mr.
richard
upton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
upton
he
would
have
hardly
any
discretions,
as
i
see
it.
i
agree
with
your
honor's
suggestion
mr.
richard
upton
those
will
have
much
the
same
effect
as
the
lights
on
range
that
the
lobster
men
fought
so
hard
to
have.
that
is
two
light
houses,
one
behind
the
other.
mr.
richard
upton
they
go
way
back
in
history.
mr.
richard
upton
that
is
what
the
claim
is.
so,
we
ended
in
to
the
compromise,
realizing
that
it
would
have
to
be
approved.
we
had
vermont
versus
new
york,
we
had
the
stipulated
record,
we
have
the
master
moving
be
rejected
and
we
had
detailed
findings
by
him
that
it
was
the
geographic
middle
rather
than
the
thalweg.
and,
we
support
that
ruling,
because
in
reviewing
the
record
of
the
boundary
commissioners,
we
find
that
when
they
referred
to
the
merrimack
river
on
the
south
they
always
used
the
words
“middle
of
the
channel,”
or
as
when
they
refer
to
the
piscataqua
river
on
the
north
they
used
“middle
of
the
river,”
and
new
hampshire
commissioners
talked
about
losing
half
the
river
to
maine,
then
massachusetts
and
the
massachusetts
commissioner
said
that
the
line
was
always
been
in
the
middle
of
the
river,
because
those
islands
nearest
to
each
state
have
always
been
taxed
by
each
state.
and,
we
say
that
language
speaks
in
terms
of
geographic
middle
just
as
in
the
case
of
texas
versus
louisiana,
where
your
honors
felt
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
directed
to
the
middle
of
the
river,
geographic
middle
rather
than
the
thalweg.
and,
we
feel
this
case
is
equally
as
strong.
thalweg
was
not
in
vogue,
as
a
tool
of
interpretation
in
1740.
also,
we
went
then
under
british
colonial
rule,
where
there
was
freedom
of
navigation
to
all
british
subjects,
including
colonists.
there
was
obstruction
freedom
of
navigation,
which
is
one
of
the
things
that
makes
thalweg
applicable.
i
have
not
touched
on
the
lights
on
range
argument
of
the
amicus
curiae
because
there
is
no
exception
before
the
court
raising
that
question,
but
if
the
court
is
interested
in
considering
it,
there
is
an
apt
quotation
in
united
states
versus
louisiana
394
us
at
page
76.
“the
unauthorized
acts
of
private
citizens
could
generally
not
support
a
claim
of
historic
title.”
and
so
in
conclusion,
we
submit
the
master’s
report
should
be
confirmed
with
the
exception
that
the
court
should
hold
it
was
error
to
use
these
low
tide
elevations.
mr.
richard
upton
i
believe
on
that
issue,
the
case
should
be
referred
back
for
findings.
mr.
richard
upton
it
makes
a
difference
of
350
yards,
your
honor,
whichever
view
was
adopted
and
…
mr.
richard
upton
we
would
gain
or
lose
300
acres,
depending
on
the
result.
mr.
richard
upton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
upton
he
brought
this
up
for
the
first
time
and
in
his
report,
this
was
not
argued
by
the
parties
or
suggested
by
him
that
he
might
consider
it.
mr.
richard
upton
no
i
do
not
object,
i
object
to
his
ruling.
mr.
richard
upton
they
do,
certainly.
mr.
richard
upton
i
do
not
object
to
it,
because
i
think
we
are
protected
and
i
think
the
court
can
refer
it
back
to
a
hearing
at
this
one
point
if
it
so
decides.
