mr.
edward
bradley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
dispute
between
the
states
of
maine
and
new
hampshire
over
the
location
of
their
lateral
marine
boundary
in
the
piscataqua
river
and
gosport
harbor
in
the
intervening
marine
area.
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
1740
boundary
decree
of
the
king
of
england,
which
describes
the
boundary
in
these
areas.
maine’s
original
interpretation
of
the
decree
was
an
extended
thalweg
line
in
piscataqua
harbor
and
gosport
harbor
intersecting
and
intervening
marine
area.
new
hampshire's
original
line
is
a
light
sun
range
line
connecting
four-point
to
whaleback
light.
it
was
maine’s
enforcement
of
its
lobster
regulations
in
the
intervening
marine
area
between
these
two
lines,
which
led
to
regulatory
conflict
and
an
attempt
to
resolve
the
boundary
through
boundary
commissioners.
this
attempt
failed.
subsequent
enforcement
action
led
to
conflict
between
enforcement
officers
of
both
states
and
an
executive
moratorium
on
enforcement
to
permit
new
hampshire
to
file
its
complaint
in
this
case.
new
hampshire
filed
that
complaint
on
june
6,
1973
and
a
master,
justice
thomas
clark
was
appointed
on
november
5,
1973.
soon
after
his
appointment,
justice
clark
met
with
counsel
for
maine
and
new
hampshire
to
urge
the
states
to
settle
this
dispute
and
to
avoid
long
and
disruptive
litigation
with
great
expense
to
the
people
of
both
states.
counsel
accepted
his
recommendation
and
met
to
review
principles
of
law,
which
would
determine
the
location
of
the
boundary
and
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
description
of
174
decree.
they
were
able
to
reach
agreement
on
this
and
filed
a
joint
motion
for
consent
decree
on
september
23,
1975.
in
february
27,
1975
the
stipulated
record
in
support
of
that
joint
motion
for
consent
was
submitted
to
the
special
master
and
the
case
was
finally
submitted
without
oral
argument
on
march
17,
1975.
after
reviewing
the
stipulated
record
and
the
consent
decree
submitted
by
the
states,
the
special
master
decided
that
he
had
to
reject
the
consent
decree,
because
he
believed
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
enter
and
also,
because
he
felt
the
geographic
middle
rather
than
thalweg
was
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
word
“middle”
in
the
boundary
description.
state
of
maine
has
taken
exceptions
to
both
of
these
determinations,
but
before
discussing
our
exceptions,
i
would
like
to
describe
to
the
court
the
substantial
prejudice,
which
special
master’s
rejection
of
the
consent
decree,
adoption
of
the
geographic
middle
line
and
also,
his
failure
to
hear
full
argumentations
on
the
issues
below
has
caused
to
the
interest
to
the
state
of
maine.
first
of
course,
we
have
lost
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire
by
the
master’s
description
of
a
new
line.
over
636
acres
of
land
in
the
intervening
marine
area,
land
which
is
in
dispute
between
new
hampshire
and
maine
fishermen,
and
presents
a
great
emotional
issue
in
both
states.
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
the
way
i
have
visualized
it
is
that
about
2
½
times
the
area
between
the
capital
and
the
lincoln
memorial.
mr.
edward
bradley
okay,
if
that
is
what
it
is.
that
is
my
visual
reference
for,
but
we
do
not
feel
that
636
acres
is
the
--
mr.
edward
bradley
no,
we
have
made
no
calculation
of
the
area
that
we
may
have
lost
in
the
harbor.
as
much
objection
as
we
have
for
the
lost
of
the
636
acres,
we
feel
that
we
have
been
much
more
greatly
prejudiced
by
the
master’s
adoption
of
an
equidistant
boundary
in
the
piscataqua
river.
the
master,
at
page
43
of
his
report,
it
indicated
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
purposes
of
this
dispute
to
delimit
that
boundary,
but
because
we
are
going
to
have
to
live
with
it,
we
have
asked
the
state
department,
the
office
of
the
geographer
to
do
a
rough
approximation
of
what
an
equidistant
line
would
look
like
and
they
have
done
it
on
a
map
that
refers
also
to
the
thalweg,
which
we
have
just
distributed
just
prior
to
the
argument.
as
you
can
see,
it
is
an
extremely
irregular
line,
which
will
be
very,
very
difficult
to
mark
on
the
water
and
will
give
rise
to
great
opportunities
for
the
kinds
of
jurisdiction
and
regulatory
conflicts,
which
gave
rise
to
dispute
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
it
is
merely
demonstrative,
it
is
not
evidence,
it
would
not
be
the
line
that
you
would
adopt
in
a
decree
or
in
anything
like
that,
it
is
just
…
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
it
was
not
the
consent
decree.
it
was
marked
by
a
range
lines
…
mr.
edward
bradley
it
is
pretty
near
that
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bradley
in
this
river
it
is
the
channel
of
…
mr.
edward
bradley
it
maybe
incredible
sir
…
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
sir
and
it
was
based
on
the
…
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
it
is
the
main
ship
channel.
it
is
the
channel
that
ships
actually
used.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bradley
no
your
honor,
there
is
not.
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
the
position
of
the
state
of
maine
is
that
is
not
an
agreement
it
is
merely
a
suggested
judicial
resolution,
which
the
special
master
had
the
power
to
enter,
as
the
proper
exercise
of
the
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
consent
to
which
both
states
were
bound,
as
we
have
seen
by
the
actions
and
behaviors
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
in
this
case
to
date
and
neither
state
is
felt
bound
to
enforce
it
against
their
citizens
or
citizens
of
other
states.
it
had
no
binding
effect
until
it
was
adopted
by
the
court
and
entered.
and,
this
is
really
our
response
to
one
of
the
suggestions
that
the
special
master
has
made.
mr.
edward
bradley
it
is
a
…
mr.
edward
bradley
it
is
a
line,
which
the
new
hampshire
legislature
does
not
agree
with
and
never
agreed
with
it.
neither
state
could
agree
with
it
to
the
political
process.
the
counsel
for
both
states,
the
attorney
general's
office
made
a
determination
that
this
was
the
appropriate
interpretation
to
legal
principles
of
the
decree
and
suggested
it
to
the
special
master.
they
have
not
indicated
that
they
do
not
agree
with
it,
they
have
just
found
the
answers
that
the
master’s
reasons
for
rejecting
it
unanswerable.
i
do
not
take
it
that
it
means
that
they
are
rejecting
it.
they
are
just
finding
that
if
he
is
correct
that
they
would
assert
a
different
line
in
this
case.
that
is
if
he
is
correct
about
rejecting
thalweg
and
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
they
would
have
him
apply
the
principles
differently
to
obtain
a
different
line,
but
made
no
statements
about
whether
they
rejected
the
consent
decree.
mr.
edward
bradley
i
really
do
not
know
the
answer
you
honor.
i
believe
that
it
is
the
natural
…
mr.
edward
bradley
it
is
marked
by
bowee
gosport
harbor,
it
is
marked
by
the
range
lines
in
piscataqua
river,
which
are
lights
connecting,
so
that
mariners
can
determine
whether
they
are
on
the
main
channel,
as
they
came
in
to
the
river.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
is.
i
feel
that
the
case
of
virginia
versus
tennessee.
it
is
determined
that
not
all
compacts
and
agreements
require
legislative
approval
and
that
only
when
the
parties
have
done
everything
they
can
to
bind
themselves
to
an
agreement
that
legislative
approval
is
required.
mr.
edward
bradley
i
am
sorry
…
mr.
edward
bradley
i
think
new
hampshire
has
answered
that
in
its
motion
to
support
the
jurisdiction
of
the
special
master,
to
enter
the
consent
decree,
which
was
filed
with
the
special
master
and
i
honestly
do
not
have
it
in
my
mind
the
principles,
but
they
have
answered
that
with
respect
to
their
authority
and
determined
at
that
time
that
their
attorney
general
did
have
authority
to
enter
it.
mr.
edward
bradley
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
…
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that
if
this
agreement
was
reached
outside
the
context
of
your
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction,
that
would
we
have
to
find
congressional
approval
under
article
1,
section
10
of
the
compact
clause.
the
point
that
i
started
to
make
with
justice
rehnquist
was
that
the
only
time
that
is
required,
once
the
original
jurisdiction
has
been
exercised
is
never
required
once
the
original
jurisdiction
has
been
exercised,
because
nothing
the
parties
do
in
the
context
of
the
exercise
binds
them
until
the
court
has
exercised
its
judicial
power.
in
the
case
that
i
cited,
virginia
v.
tennessee,
148
us
503,
the
states
of
virginia
and
tennessee
entered
into
a
preliminary
boundary
agreements
prior
to
entering
into
binding
boundary
agreement
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
all
compacts
and
agreements
do
not
require
congressional
approval
and
it
is
only
when
the
states
do
something
that
actually
binds
themselves
independent
of
the
judiciary.
i
believe
they
are
outside
the
context
of
original
jurisdiction
that
the
approval
of
congress
is
required
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
reasons
the
congressional
approval
is
required
in
the
first
place,
which
was
to
protect
the
united
states
interest
against
compacts
and
agreements
by
the
states,
which
could
affect
federal
interest.
it
has
been
held
long
time
in
this
court
that
the
exercise
of
judicial
power
is
satisfactory
substitute
for
congressional
approval,
when
original
jurisdiction
is
exercised.
and,
we
believe
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
decree
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bradley
the
state
of
maine
legislature
has
taken
no
action.
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
both
houses,
as
i
understand
they
have
passed
concurrent
resolutions
rejecting
the
decree,
but
not
passed
any
law,
which
is
binding
on
them
and
that
is
a
matter
of
their
state
law,
which
i
…
mr.
edward
bradley
our
legislature
has
done
nothing.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
your
honor,
the
decree
establishes
the
location
of
the
thalweg
and
the
termination
of
the
thalweg
and
the
straight
line
portion
of
the
boundary
by
latitudes
and
longitudes.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
your
honor,
in
filing
that
motion
for
joint
judgment,
he
indicated
that
“i
do
not
only
agree
with
it,
but
it
was
an
appropriate
application
of
law
and
the
fact
and
it
was
the
best
interest
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
at
that
time.”
mr.
edward
bradley
the
principle
which
supports
it
is
the
principle
of
maine
channel
or
thalweg.
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
we
have
agreed
to
it,
but
we
have
agreed
to
it
by
reference
to
charts,
which
indicate
the
depths
of
the
water
and
i
understand
…
mr.
edward
bradley
it
turns
out
to
be
a
relatively
straight
line.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
your
honor,
it
is
definitely
the
course
that
mariners
sail.
i
have
to
admit
that
i
honestly
do
not
know
that
it
is
exactly
the
deepest
part
of
the
river.
mr.
edward
bradley
the
main
part
of
the
channel.
mr.
edward
bradley
but,
the
indication
that
this
is
the
safest
place
to
sail
and
therefore
the
deepest
is
that
the
largest
vessels
that
come
in
to
the
area,
stay
right
on
that
range
line,
all
the
time
they
are
coming
in.
they
do
not
deviate
from
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
talking
to
pilots
we
have
had
indications
that
there
is
very
little
room.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bradley
no
your
honor,
if
you
decided
that
…
mr.
edward
bradley
the
thalweg
was
the
proper
principle,
but
…
mr.
edward
bradley
i
would
agree
that
the
consent
decree
should
be
that
the
court
would
have
the
power
and
should
not
maybe
project
some
consent
decree,
but
they
should
not
accept
the
master’s
line.
what
they
should
do
is
send
us
back
for
a
full
determination
of
the
concept
of
thalweg
and
where
it
actually
lies
on
the
ground.
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
prejudices
to
our
interest
we
feel,
that
we
have
had,
because
of
the
master’s
decision
without
oral
argument.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bradley
right,
why
i
am
arguing
the
consent
decree
is
so
hard,
because
the
master
has
indicated
that
if
you
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
it,
that
you
should
enter
it.
and,
that
he
has
not
felt
it
necessary
to
recommend
rejection
of
the
thalweg
line
without
regard.
mr.
edward
bradley
i
think
you
have
exercised
your
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
edward
bradley
you
would
have
jurisdiction,
i
believe
whether
you
agreed
or
not.
you
could
still
reject
it
as
an
inappropriately
application
of
law
of
fact
with
all
respect
to
jurisdiction.
you
could
reject
it
certainly
for
other
reasons
than
the
lack
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
edward
bradley
no,
your
honor.
not
in
this
…
i
just
think
…
mr.
edward
bradley
yes,
it
might
be
a
reason
for
rejecting
it,
you
honor.
the
point
that
we
are
making
in
this
case
is
that
every
indication
in
the
boundary
proceedings
was
the
thalweg
was
meant
when
the
term
middle
was
used.
the
special
master
has
referred
to
some
of
the
evidence
we
referred
to
in
our
brief
with
regard
to
the
use
of
channel
in
the
merrimack
river
and
also,
with
regard
to
deeds
relied
on
by
massachusetts,
which
referred
to
the
channel
of
piscataqua.
there
are
two
indications
though
that
were
not
cited
on
the
brief
or
referred
to
by
the
special
master,
which
we
think
are
a
strong
indication
that
the
term
“channel”
was
meant,--
channel
was
meant
when
the
term
“middle“
was
used.
the
first
of
these
is
the
charter
of
king
charles
ii
to
rhode
island
in
1664
was
issued
just
before
the
charter
that
he
issued
to
new
hampshire
in
1679.
that
charter
is
described
in
rhode
island,
massachusetts
at
37
united
states
464.
and,
in
that
charter,
the
king
charles,
the
persons,
who
issued
one
of
the
boundary
determinations
that
was
in
the
line
of
title,
the
boundary
commissioners
were
determining
indicated
that
the
definition
of
“middle”
was
“channel.”
thus,
when
he
has
describing
the
location
of
the
boundary
between
connecticut
and
rhode
island
to
the
south,
he
indicated
that
it
went
to
the
middle
or
to
the
channel
of
a
river
there
commonly
called
and
known
by
the
name
of
pawcatuck.
we
think
is
a
contemporaneous
indication
that
thalweg
was
in
vogue
and
being
used
at
the
time
the
decree
was
entered.
the
master
has
seized
upon
the
use
of
the
word
“the
half”
in
the
new
hampshire's
petition
for
appeal
is
apparently
the
strongest
basis
for
adopting
geographic
middle
and
we
found
a
passage
in
bellmap,
history
of
new
hampshire,
which
indicates
how
insignificant
the
use
of
the
“half”
is
in
the
description
of
that
boundary.
thus,
it
is
clear
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
in
authorizing
the
appeal
did
not
use
the
word
the
“half”.
the
only
time
it
was
used
is
by
the
solicitor
for
the
state
of
new
hampshire
plus
someone
who
had
been
hired
and
was
in
england
filing
papers
before
the
king’s
counsel
and
a
petition
for
appeal.
the
passage
in
bellmap,
which
is
very,
very
short.
i
would
just
like
to
read,
because
it
describes
the
relationship
between
this
solicitor
in
england
and
new
hampshire's
actual
intentions
and
he
says,
“they
obliged
us
to
make
bricks
without
straw,
above
all
why
did
not
they
send
a
copy
of
their
own
appeal,
for
want
of
it,
i
have
been
forced
to
guess
what
that
appeal
was.
from
loose
passages
in
mr.
a’s
letters.”
so
the
solicitor,
who
use
the
word
“the
half,”
had
to
guess
what
new
hampshire
is
doing
back
in
the
colonies.
he
did
not
have
any
direct
information,
new
hampshire
when
he
used
the
word
“half.”
we
believe
that
strongly
this
undercuts
the
master’s
strong
reliance
on
the
use
of
the
word
“half”
to
determine
geographic
middle.
mr.
edward
bradley
i
am
sorry.
that
is
page
251
of
bellmap’s
history
of
new
hampshire.
finally,
i
like
to
also
note
that
this
use
of
the
word
“half”
was
in
the
petition
for
appeal
was
the
second
time
the
new
hampshire
used
that
word.
the
first
time
they
used
it,
they
used
it
with
regard
to
navigational
criteria
and
not
criteria
based
on
geometric
concepts,
such
as
geographic
middle.
thus,
in
the
boundary
proceedings,
they
indicated
that
the
half
of
the
isle
of
shoals
was
divided
by
the
harbor
of
rhode,
which
lay
between.
now,
this
is
a
clear
reference
to
navigational
use
of
the
area
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
use
of
thalweg
or
channel
in
the
other
portion
of
the
northern
boundary
and
not
with
the
master’s
adoption
of
a
geometric
concept
to
determine
the
meaning
of
the
word
middle.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
bradley
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
questions
that
were
raised
with
respect
to
whether
a
factual
determination
is
required
in
determining
whether
these
low
tide
elevations,
the
special
master
used
qualified
for
the
test
under
the
geneva
convention.
the
arguments
that
my
brother
upton
has
made
are
that
this
is
not
an
island,
a
low
tide
elevation
within
the
meaning
of
island
part
of
the
maine
land.
these
kinds
of
questions
have
given
rise
to
substantial
evidentiary
hearings
in
cases
in
louisiana.
an
opportunity
which
the
state
of
maine
or
the
state
of
new
hampshire
had,
because
of
the
way
this
came
up
to
this
court.
this
is
a
problem
in
another
regard.
the
special
master,
we
believe
has
seriously
prejudiced
a
right
of
the
state
of
maine
that
exists
outside
the
issues
in
this
dispute.
thus,
the
master
found
it
was
essential
to
determine
where
the
location
of
inland
waters
was,
because
he
felt
this
court
in
us
may
determine
that
there
was
no
ownership
in
the
intervening
area
between
gosport
harbor
and
piscataqua.
but,
we
believe
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
reservation
of
jurisdiction,
which
this
court
has
exercised
at
421
us
958
in
granting
the
motion
of
the
united
states
government
to
reserve
its
jurisdiction
to
determine
questions
just
to
this
nature.
state
of
maine
has
an
historic
inland
water
claim
and
other
coastline
claims,
which
would
give
its
sovereignty
over
the
area
between
piscatqua
harbor
and
gosport
harbor
and
we
believe
that
we
should
have
the
opportunity
to
be
permitted
to
apply
the
criteria
that
the
courts
announced
in
dealing
with
similar
claims
states
of
alaska,
florida
and
louisiana
in
just
last
term.
the
master’s
determination
has
precluded
us
from
doing
that
and
we
do
not
even
know
he
was
doing
it,
until
a
report
came
out.
we
did
not
in
choosing
thalweg,
in
choosing
straight
line
portion
of
the
boundary
think
that
we
needed
to
determine
the
extent
of
inland
waters,
which
is
why
the
questions,
which
the
master
has
focused
so
strongly
on,
with
respect
to
the
locations
of
inland
water
and
geographic
middle
are
almost
irrelevant
to
the
determinations
that
went
in
to
the
consent
decree.
all
we
needed
to
do
was
to
decide
thalweg
was
appropriate
in
the
river
in
the
harbor
and
then
determine
where
the
line
ended.
that
did
not
need
any
great
application
of
legal
principles,
because
it
was
a
factual
question.
the
channel
gradually
disappeared
as
it
hit
the
open
ocean.
we
did
not
need
to
determine
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
i
submit
that
we
did
not.
all
we
did
was
determine
a
reasonable
place
for
the
thalweg
to
end
without
having
any
requirement
for
determining
inland
waters.
we
believe
we
have
been
prejudiced
by
the
determination
of
the
master
and
that
if
you
are
going
to
use
a
concept
of
inland
waters
that
we
ought
to
have
our
opportunity
in
this
court.
these
boundaries
are
very
serious
things
to
the
states.
we
are
going
to
have
to
live
with
them
for
a
long
time.
we
believe
we
deserved
the
opportunity
to
have
a
full
determination
of
our
facts
and
evidence
before
the
courts
merely
accepts
the
report
of
the
special
master.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
bradley
your
honor,
we
never
had
the
opportunity
…
mr.
edward
bradley
i
am
arguing
that
we
should
have
a
determination
of
hearing
on
geographic
middle,
on
inland
waters
and
also,
the
rejection
of
thalweg.
mr.
edward
bradley
the
master
felt
that
he
had
to
determine
the
location
of
the
geographic
middle
by
a
closing
line
across
inland
waters
to
determine
the
end
point
of
the
straight
line
terminates
to
the
boundary.
mr.
edward
bradley
no,
i
am
only
saying
that
if
you
choose
the
principles
we
adopted
in
our
judgment
for
consent
decree,
it
is
unnecessary
to
determine
the
extent
of
inland
waters.
that
can
be
left
an
open
question
for
determination
…
mr.
edward
bradley
if
you
disagree
with
us
…
mr.
edward
bradley
then,
if
you
do,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
you
should
send
it
back
to
the
special
master
for
determination.
so,
we
can
have
a
full
opportunity
to
develop
them.
we
have
not
had
that
opportunity
up
to
this
point.
mr.
edward
bradley
i
have
suggested
…
mr.
edward
bradley
i
am
suggesting
your
honor
that
you
do
not
have
the
proper
development
of
the
case
at
this
point.
to
determine
whether
you
can
disagree
with
us,
i
have
suggested
two
things
today
that
were
not
even
mentioned
before
the
special
master.
the
question
of
whether
contemporaneous
charter
in
rhode
island
has
any
effect
on
the
usage
of
thalweg.
i
suggested
that
the
master
seriously
over
estimated
the
concept
of
the
half
when
it
was
used
in
the
petition
for
appeal.
i
believe
there
are
hundreds
of
other
items
…
mr.
edward
bradley
yes
we
did,
with
respect
to
the
…
mr.
edward
bradley
just
the
concept
of
thalweg
your
honor,
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
concept
that
he
ultimately
adopted
and
we
believe
that
if
he
is
going
to
not
only
reject
our
consent
decree,
but
adopt
an
entirely
new
principle
that
we
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
present
our
case
with
respect
to
whether
that
is
appropriate
or
not.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes,
your
honor.
we
had
no
fight
on
the
merits
and
no
opportunity
and
it
is
going
to
be
hard
enough
to
enforce
the
lines
that
the
masters
adopted.
it
is
going
to
be
extremely
hard,
if
we
feel
the
people
of
the
state
of
maine
feel
that
they
have
not
have
the
proper
opportunity
to
present
their
position
to
the
court.
mr.
edward
bradley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bradley
no
sir,
i
want
to
go
back
through
the
documents.
i
want
to
go
back
through
the
usage.
i
want
to
have
an
…
mr.
edward
bradley
as
of
right
now,
i
do
not
have
a
full
--
we
have
not
develop
the
cases
entirely
as
it
should
have
been
to
this
point.
we
are
really
at
the
stage
now
where
we
are
no
more
than
at
a
preliminary
trial
stage,
because
the
way
the
case
developed
below
you.
you
do
not
have
a
full
development
of
any
of
the
facts
or
issues
of
this
case.
mr.
edward
bradley
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
if
he
does
adopt
the
geographic
middle
that
the
only
…
mr.
edward
bradley
he
has
the
right
line.
thank
you
very
much.
