will
you
let
us
have
the
page
citation
for
finding
that?
justice
stevens
mr.
upton,
before
you
start,
since
you
are
interrupted,
i
am
kind
of
new
on
this
kind
of
litigation,
what
is
the
standard
of
review
that
we
should
apply
in
deciding
how
grossly
err,
the
master
must
be
before
we
take
another
look?
justice
stevens
it
is
not
enough
for
you
merely
to
persuade
us
that
he
might
have
done
a
better
job.
justice
stevens
i
did
not
understand
you
to
contend
that
it
would
never
in
any
situation
be
appropriate
to
use
this
projections,
low
water
projections,
whatever
they
are
called,
or
are
you
just
saying
that
this
particular
case
it
is
inappropriate.
justice
stevens
were
those
holdings
in
particular
bad
situations
or
do
you
read
those
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
is
never
appropriate
to
use
this
kind
of
reference?
justice
stevens
just
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down.
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
in
part
argue
that
the
master
did
not
adequately
consider
the
low
tide
elevation
point.
do
you
make
arguments
before
us
that
you
did
not
make
before
him?
did
he
have
the
same
chance
to
praise
these
issues
you
are
asking
us
to
do?
justice
stevens
did
you
take
exception
to
the
procedure
you
followed.
justice
stevens
my
brother
stewart's
ruling.
justice
stevens
you
do
not
take
(inaudible)
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
bradley,
let
me
understand.
you
are
arguing
that
if
you
had
a
full
opportunity
you
might
be
able
to
persuade
him
that
he
should
not
adopt
the
geographic
middle
principle.
are
you
also
arguing
that
if
he
does
adopt
the
geographic
middle
principle,
it
might
be
placed
elsewhere?
justice
stevens
he
has
the
right
line.
