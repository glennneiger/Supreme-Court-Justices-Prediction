justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that
about,
one
square
mile?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
about
640
acres
in
a
square
mile
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
depends,
it
is
not
upon
the
consent
of
both
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
case
of
the
land,
whatever
you
call
it,
the
center
or
what
--
jointly
submitted
by
the
two
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
that
still?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
authority
from
this
court
as
to
whether
a
proposed
consent
decree
needs
the
ratification
of
the
legislative
branches
of
the
two
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
congressional
approval
…
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
thinking,
in
terms
of
what
sort
of
authorization
do
counsel
representing
two
states
in
an
original
action
of
this
court
need
in
order
to
consent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
tell
me,
what
legal
principle
would
support
this
straight
line
in
the
harbor
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
really
suggest
that
on
the
ground
that
is
what
you
would
find
the
thalweg?
you
have
not
even
attempted
to
say
where
the
thalweg
is,
have
you?
you
have
just
agreed
where
it
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
ought
to
be
a
straight
line
like
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mariners
sail,
what
is
safe
to
sail
and
if
a
straight
line
is
more
convenient,
they
sail
straight
line.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
deep
enough
for
the
largest
ships
in
that
line.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
you
are
going
to
get
the
arguing
that
he
adopted
their
own
principle.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
wholly
aside
from
the
consent
decree.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
from
the
consent
itself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
you
affirmatively
support
the
rest
of
the
master’s
decree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
his
decision
that
the
geographic
middle
is
the
right
division
in
the
river.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
it
was
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
just
a
resolution
by
your
legislature
or
was
it
approved
by
the
governor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
entered
into
the
compromised
agreement,
i
take
it
that
those
who
were
acting
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
felt
it
was
consistent
with
that
first
act
of
the
new
hampshire
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
of
course
you
do
not
know
whether
this
court
will
approve
it
or
adopt
it
until
you
have
submitted
it
to
the
master,
he
in
turn
has
submitted
to
the
court
and
this
court
has
decided
one
way
or
the
other,
i
suppose.
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
a
sense,
it
is
like
a
stipulation,
we
settle
it,
personal
entry
claim
where
two
lawyers
get
together
and
agree
and
they
have
to
submit
it
to
the
court.
so,
the
matter
remains
open,
until
the
judge
actually
approves
the
stipulation.
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
not
there
some
contract,
law,
theory
that
would
say
neither
party
has
a
right
to
repudiate
it
during
the
reasonable
time
that
is
taken
to
go
through
the
steps
necessary
for
judicial
approval?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
think
it
would
affect
it,
how
about
for
example
the
center
point
of
the
mouth
of
the
harbor,
where
would
it
move
to?
how
far
it
would
move
do
you
know?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
that
the
only
trial
you
had
was
basically
a
truncated
one
devoted
to
the
authorization
for
the
consent
decree,
rather
than
a
fight
on
the
merits.
