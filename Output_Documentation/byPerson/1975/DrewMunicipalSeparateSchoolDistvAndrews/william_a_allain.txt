mr.
william
a.
allain
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
not
intend
to
burden
the
court
probably
with
that
much
time,
your
honor,
but
we
would
like
to
say
and
address
ourselves
for
a
few
moments
to
this
document
and
the
statistics
which
have
been
introduced
at
this
late
date
and
say
that
the
court
really
should
not
consider
them
for
the
simple
reason
there
is
no
showing
in
the
document
and
no
showing
in
the
statistics
in
a
nexus
between
the
rule
which
we
now
have
under
question
here
and
the
increase
of
the
white
teacher
ratio
in
the
school
district.
other
statistics
would
show
that
also
there
is
a
white
increase
in
the
student
body
which
is
not,
of
course,
before
this
court,
and
therefore,
we
say
to
the
court
that
many
variables
had
entered
into
this
particular
thing.
one
of
them
is
title
i,
as
being
no
longer
available
in
the
amount
it
used
to
be
for
teachers
and
teacher’s
aides.
so,
we
do
not
think
it
adds
anything
to
the
case
whatsoever
and
should
not
be
used
in
any
determination
or
decision.
we
would
say
to
the
court,
and
we
do
not
necessarily
know
whether
this
is
of
any
import,
but
mississippi
does
have
statutes
against
fornication
and
adultery
and
also,
counsel
said
that
this
rule
did
not
apply
as
equally
to
males
as
it
does
to
females.
mr.
william
a.
allain
yes,
your
honor,
except
maybe
she
was
talking
about
there
is
a
fornication
statute.
it
may
not
act
on
one
act
of
fornication.
it
may
be
cohabitation
and
that
is
the
way
we
take
issue
rather
than
there
is
fornication
statute
in
mississippi.
i
think
counsel
would
acknowledge
that.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no,
your
honor,
it
would
probably
have
to
take
more
proof
than
that,
maybe,
to
bring
it
about.
we
say
to
the
court
that
we
recognize,
and
the
court
has
recognized
in
several
cases,
that
maybe
there
is
a
little
more
difficulty
in
ferreting
out.
i
think
as
the
chief
justice
has
said
in
one
case
of
the
natural
father,
but
this
court
is
also
on
the
record
by
saying
that
mere
fact
that
sometimes
it
is
more
difficult
to
find
the
natural
father
does
not
mean
that
the
natural
father
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
it
could
apply
to
a
male
once
it
had
been
established
that
a
male
is
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
would
be
right.
mr.
william
a.
allain
well,
your
honor,
we
are
talking
really
here
i
guess
about
not
knowledge,
but
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
lie
or
not.
now,
the
male
teacher
is
willing
to
tell
the
school
district
“no,
i
do
not
have
an
illegitimate
child
or
has
never
been
adjudicated
so,
but
we
are
not
here
talking
in
the
realms
of
determining
when
you
have
one
of
a
knowledge.
we
are
talking
about
then,
whether
someone
desires
to
lie
about
it.
now,
we
do
have
in
this
particular
case
a
falsification
of
an
application
and
mr.
chief
justice
says
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
that
would
not,
your
honor,
and
i
was
going
to
say
the
only
reason
that
nothing
probably
were
done
further
on
that
particular
issue
was
because
we
were
in
litigation
and
would
not
want
to
be
seeming
that
we
were
punishing
someone
who
had
sued
the
school
district.
we
would
get
another
--
maybe
another
lawsuit
about
that.
mr.
william
a.
allain
right,
it
would
apply
across
the
board
and
as
i
say,
we
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
now,
we
are
trying
to
keep
also
men
from
fathering
illegitimate
children.
mr.
william
a.
allain
well,
i
think
it
is
in
the
record
that
illegitimacy
and
as
in
this
record,
except
in
artificial
insemination
somebody
else
have
got
to
be
a
partner.
we
had
gone
in
and
we
think
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
well,
i
think
if
you
had
a
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
think
if
you
had
a
known
fact
that
a
father
had
a
child
out
of
wedlock,
this
would
have
the
same
adverse
example
as
it
would,
the
woman
who
had
out
of
wedlock
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
he
would
have
it
i
think
on
the
board,
then
maybe
also
on
the
girls.
i
think
the
girls
would
also
look
up
--
mr.
william
a.
allain
well,
maybe
age
will
take
that
job,
but
we
--[laughter]i
am
speaking
for
myself.
mr.
william
a.
allain
no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
is
from
experience.
we
think
that
the
court
has
said
that
and
the
reason
we
introduced
the
expert
testimony
is
that,
as
this
court
is
well
aware
in
certain
employment
cases
that
all
bringing
in
experts
and
eeoc
is
talking
about
we
need
validated
studies
and
empirical
information,
but
this
court
just
recently
in
the
election
cases,
held
i
think,
set
out
that
examples
and
appearances
mean
sometimes
as
much
as
reality
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
a
teacher
or
a
coach
or
what
have
you,
or
a
principal
as
being
an
example,
as
setting
an
example
in
the
community,
and
therefore,
that
we
think
and
especially
under
these
particular
situations
we
think,
now
counsel
said
all
we
had
are
the
ulterior
motives,
we
are
trying
to
get
rid
of
certain
individuals.
there
is
probably
75%
of
the
teaching
staff
in
drew,
which
is
i
am
going
outside
the
record
now,
your
honor,
which
are
all
females.
so,
we
are
not
trying
to
get
rid
of
females,
but
the
situation
that
exists
there,
i
think
shows
that
there
was
a
need,
a
necessity,
a
pressing
need
for
something
to
be
done
by
this
school
district
in
order
to
cut
down
on
this
rising
rate
of
illegitimacy
not
only
in
the
school
district,
but
in
sunflower
county
itself.
mr.
william
a.
allain
i
think
that
the
record
shows,
as
to
sunflower
county,
it
was
a
rising
rate,
yes
sir,
i
think
maybe
one
or
two
points
at
a
time,
but
the
record
will
either
say
i
was
uninformed
about
the
record
or
i
was
correct.
mr.
william
a.
allain
we
do
not
have
any
figures
in
the
record,
your
honor.
there
are
some
that
show
that
there
is
a
decline
now
at
the
time,
but
i
will
be
going
outside
the
record,
your
honor,
in
that
case.
they
are
not
before
the
court.
thank
you.
