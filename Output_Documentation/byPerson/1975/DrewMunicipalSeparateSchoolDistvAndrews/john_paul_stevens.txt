mr.
attorney,
could
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second?
where
did
you
quote
the
rule
from?
is
that
from
the
principal’s
testimony
or
is
that
in
writing
somewhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
record,
they
show
that
students
knew
that
these
two
teachers
were
mothers
of
illegitimate
children?
justice
john
paul
stevens
referring
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
do
you
think
the
state
could
make
it
a
crime
to
bear
a
child
out
of
wedlock?
that
is
the
question
he
perhaps
should
have
asked
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
the
circumstances
of
the
pregnancy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
state
could
not
make
it
a
crime
to
bear
a
child
out
of
wedlock?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
any
other
parents
than
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
being
the
parent
of
an
illegitimate
child
constitute
a
violation
to
that
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
if
you
justify
the
rule
entirely
on
the
basis
of
the
role
model
theory,
how
can
that
possibly
apply
to
a
man?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
knowledge
of
the
students,
that
the
male
was
the
parent
of
an
illegitimate
child?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
show
what
happened
a
year
after
the
rule
was
adapted?
