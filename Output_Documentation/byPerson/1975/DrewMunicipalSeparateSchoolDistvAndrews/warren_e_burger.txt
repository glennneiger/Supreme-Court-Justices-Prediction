as
a
rule,
might
it
not
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
this
was
an
employment
policy
or
a
personnel
policy?

what
about
the

was
any
issue
made
in
the
litigation
of
the
false
answer

in
mind
that
in
a
federal
application,
it
is
a
felony
to

position?
chief

any
of
the
judges
dealing
with
this
or
did
the
school
board
make
an
issue
out
of
false
answers
as
distinguished
from
the
substantive
aspects
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
question
here,

issue
in

well.
please

chief

warren
e.

is
it
in

record?
chief

warren
e.

you

not

give
it
any
weight
or
consideration
here,
would
you?
chief

warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
the
way
appellate
review
is
conducted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
concede
that
the
employment
barrier
could
be
based
on
a
conviction
or
fornication
if
the
state
had
such
a
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
explore
hypothetical
compositions
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
was
a
state
law
making
it
a
criminal
act,
could
the
conviction
of
a
crime
be
a
barrier
to
employment
by
a
school
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
a
statute
of
the
state
that
no
person
shall
be
employed
as
a
teacher
or
teacher’s
aide
and
whatever
the
other
categories
are,
where
they
are
exemplars
to
the
students,
if
they
have
been
convicted
of
a
criminal
act
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
would
that
be
an
unconstitutional
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
required
to
answer
a
hypothetical
question,
i
am
just
trying
to
test

or
does
it
apply
to
black
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
it
applies
only
to
females
or
its
impact
is
greater
on
females?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
arguing
that
this
kind
of
conduct
has
no
impact
on
children
if
they
are
aware
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
violation
to
the
rule?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
addressing
my
question
to
whether
premarital
conduct
of
this
kind
by
teachers,
men
or
women,
if
known
in
the
community
would
have
no
adverse
impact
on
children
or
students
in
the
primary

junior
high
schools?

correcting
that
statement
about
mr.

view
of
the
matter
to
some
other
case
that
is
not
yet
here

is
that
it

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
believe
she
was
not
clear
enough
as
to
what
would
happen
in
that
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
do
not
have
a
dietitian
here.
we
have
just
teachers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
an
imbalance
in
the
faculty
that
violates
constitutional
principles
as
laid
down
by
this
court
in
mr.
justice
black’s
opinion
of
some
years
ago,
that
that
could
be
the
subject
of
independent
litigation,
could
it
not?

were
a
male

the
two
of

what
if
the
football
coach,
a
man
and
one
of
the
women
school
teachers,
of
whatever
race,
religion
or
creed
produced

does
it

any
expert
testimony
or
anything
in

record
to
show
that
that

an
impact
on
all
people
who
know
