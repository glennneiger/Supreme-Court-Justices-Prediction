ms.
rhonda
copelon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
here
to
the
fundamental
rights
intruded
upon
by
this
rule
and
also
to
the
sexist
comminatory
character
of
the
rule.
now,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
understand
your
question,
you
are
saying
why
can
you
not
use
the
unwed
mother
as
a
symbol
of
some
sexual
conduct
that
is
not
appropriate
here
for
schoolgirls.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
well
i
think,
as
we
will
show,
that
it
is
clear
that
they
could
not
make
the
bearing
of
an
out-of-wedlock
child
a
crime.
moreover,
fornication
is
not
a
crime
under
the
law
of
mississippi.
you
have
to
have
cohabitation.
you
have
to
have
continual
conduct.
we
would
also
question,
but
it
is
not
before
this
court
to
decide,
whether
mississippi
has
the
power
to
intrude
upon
the
private
lives
of
individuals.
it
is
not
an
enforced
statute
to
be
sure.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
do
not
think,
under
this
court’s
decision,
it
could,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
question
is
before
this
court.
i
also
think
that
the
school
district
cannot
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
saying
that
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
isenstot
and
roe
and
in
number
of
cases
where
the
deterrence
of
premarital
conduct
is
not
a
purpose
for
punitive
treatment.
it
is
not
a
useful
way.
if
we
look
at
the
reality
recognized
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
isenstot,
by
this
court
in
griswold,
these
kinds
of
statutes
intrude
deeply
into
personal
freedom.
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
to
decide
that
issue.
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
woman
can
be
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
woman
can
be
brought
out
as
a
symbol
of
her
and
only
her
premarital
sexual
conduct
and
we
say
that
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
address
that
question.
yes,
it
does
apply
only
to
females.
there
are
two
reasons
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
the
way
the
rule
is
defined,
designed
and
implemented,
it
applies
only
to
females.
it
is
directed
at
females.
that
is
its
purpose.
now,
let
me
try
to
explain.
the
reason
we
say
you
cannot
think
aloud
a
woman,
a
parent
of
an
unwed
child,
here
a
woman,
an
unwed
mother
as
a
symbol
is
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
you
are
intruding
on
fundamental
human
rights
recognized
by
this
court.
the
right
not
to
be
forced
to
have
an
abortion
which
is
one
way
of
avoiding
the
rule
and
maintaining
your
job
and
the
right
not
to
be
required
to
get
rid
of
your
child,
but
to
hold
on
to
your
child.
another
right
recognized
by
this
court
is
fundamental.
thirdly,
the
way
this
rule
is
designed,
the
way
it
is
defined
by
mr.
petty,
the
way
it
is
implemented
and
its
impact
inevitably
shows
the
sex
discriminatory
character
of
this
illegitimacy
classification.
first,
let
me
address
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
also
absolutely
true.
there
is
no
symbolic
character
to
this
rule.
there
is
no
impact
on
the
schoolchildren.
there
is
no
knowledge
demonstrated.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
pardon
me,
your
honor?
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
number
one,
just
to
bring
it
down
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
there
is
no
knowledge
whatsoever
shown
by
the
schoolchildren.
beyond
that,
there
is
no
basis
to
believe
that
schoolchildren
even
if
they
knew
would
do
as
the
nea
said
“monkey
see,
monkey
do.”
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
there
was,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
abortion
question
because
i
think
that
the
petitioners
here
are
raising
a
straw
person.
they
are
saying
we
are
coming
to
this
court
and
we
are
saying
you
are
espousing
a
right
to
be
illegitimate
children.
we
are
not
espousing
that
here.
no
one
espoused
it
in
the
schools
at
drew,
mississippi.
the
respondents
did
not
espouse
it.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
court
said
in
roe
that
you
cannot
prevent
a
woman
from
having
an
abortion
and
you
cannot
likewise
compel
her
to
have
an
abortion.
this
rule
makes
very
clear
one
thing.
if
she
has
an
abortion,
she
can
keep
her
job.
they
are
not
investigating
premarital
sex
and
they
are
not
investigating
abortion,
and
they
could
not.
they
say
they
could
not
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
another
possibility
and
that
is,
as
the
district
court
said,
a
woman
could
take
the
more
circumspect
or
conventional
route
and
surrender
her
children
to
others
for
upbringing.
so,
the
other
price
of
employment
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that
is
for
certain
a
possibility,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
not
a
possibility
for
these
respondents.
they
did
not
know
about
contraception.
they
did
not
have
the
counseling
as
mrs.
peacock
herself
said,
that
white
folks
have
that
tells
them
about
how
to
not
get
pregnant.
she
did
not
want
to
get
pregnant.
she
says
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
have
an
illegitimate
child,
a
child
out
of
wedlock.
that
option
was
not
open
there
and
the
school
district
is
not
helping
that
though
they
say
they
are
concerned
about
schoolgirl
pregnancies.
your
honor,
the
rule
has
its
impact
in
terms
of
coercion
and
in
terms
of
burdening
fundamental
liberties
not
only
on
the
woman,
but
on
the
child,
because
the
child
and
the
mother
are
bound
up.
if
the
child
is
abandoned,
the
child
is
estranged.
for
a
black
child
and
for
a
black
unwed
mother,
there
are
not
very
many
options
about
abandoning
your
child
because
it
is
true
abandonment.
there
are
not
many
homes
that
will
take
black
children
and
adapt
them
and
so,
for
the
black
child,
it
is
a
life
of
parentlessness
that
that
mother
would
be
subjecting
the
child
to
and
a
life
of
institutions
and
a
life
of
temporary
shelters.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
it
is
dual,
your
honor.
it
is
that
we
say
that
there
are
fundamental
human
rights
directly
infringed
here
by
the
exclusion
from
employment
and
so
there
is
due
process
liberty
involved.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
no,
your
honor,
it
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
we
could
prevail
on
that
basis,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
we
could
prevail
as
well
on
the
grounds
that
this
is
race
discriminatory
and
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
that
it
is
sex
discriminatory.
i
would
like
to
say,
however,
in
terms
that
the
due
process
equal
protection
contrast,
this
is
not
a
case
which
involves
due
process
conclusive
presumption
analysis
because
that
would
import
all
of
the
discrimination
and
all
of
the
deprivation
that
we
are
trying
to
prevent
here
and
it
would
perpetuate
that
stigma
to
say
that
unwed
parenthood
or
motherhood
was
relevant
at
all.
so,
we
do
not
reach
that
stage
of
individualized
determination
in
this
case.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
present
a
completely
different
question.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
do
not
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
well,
number
one,
age
has
never
been
given
quite
the
kind
of
constitutional
scrutiny
by
this
court.
that
classification
is
based
on
race
and
classifications
based
on
sex
and
classification
based
on
illegitimacy.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
it
purports
not
to
be,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
and
by
looking
at
if
we
--
counsel
used
the
term
“caught”
and
what
we
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
there
was
not
very
much
search
to
catch
anyone
here
and
that
just
as
focusing
on
nurturance
and
on
the
woman
who
is
rearing
that
child,
invades
the
fundamental
right
to
keep
that
child.
so,
it
determines
this
rule
to
be
a
sex-based
classification.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
do
not
think
it
is
clear
yet,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
it
is
certainly
greater
than
the
scrutiny
given
to
age
classifications.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
words
in
stanton
clearly
put
the
sex
basis
on
a
sex
classification
and
require
a
heightened
scrutiny.
in
a
case
where
it
was
required
we
urge
upon
this
court,
it
should
given
suspect
status,
but
we
do
not
think
with
the
constellation
of
fundamental
rights
and
protected
interests
that
are
involved
here,
that
we
need
urge
upon
this
court
that
sex
be
given
suspect
status
in
this
case.
to
look
at
the
rule
and
why
it
is
sex-based,
in
part
it
is
common
sense.
unwed
parent
means,
commonly,
unwed
mother.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
illustrate
that,
historically
and
legally,
it
means
unwed
mother.
peter
stanley
had
to
come
all
the
way
here
to
be
recognized
as
a
parent
under
the
law
of
illinois.
sereta
gomez
had
to
come
all
the
way
here
to
have
her
father’s
duty
to
support
her
be
recognized
and
fundamentally,
illegitimacy
means
legal
fatherlessness.
if
the
father
legitimates
the
child,
the
child
is
no
longer,
under
law,
illegitimate.
mr.
petty
meant
it
too.
he
tried
to
use
the
term
“unwed
parent.”
it
sounds
better,
but
he
could
not
stick
to
it.
he
admitted
it
at
the
hearing
that
his
instruction
to
ms.
mccorpel
who
implemented
the
policy
was
that
she
should
exclude
unwed
mothers.
he
admitted
at
the
hearing
he
knew
that
something
more
would
have
to
be
done
to
find
unwed
fathers
because
women
were
so
obvious,
but
he
did
not
give
her
any
instructions
to
investigate
unwed
fathers.
and
finally,
she
did
not
investigate
the
one
male
in
her
employee.
why,
because
she
said
he
was
married,
but
mr.
petty
makes
clear
that
marriage
does
not
cure
the
disability.
any
pretense
to
neutrality
is,
therefore,
removed
by
the
fact
that
his
rule
focuses
on
the
nurturing
parent.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
is
under-inclusive
because
it
does
not
reach
the
unwed
father
and
it
is
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
know
whether
mrs.
peacock
married
the
father
of
the
child.
fundamentally,
that
is
irrelevant.
in
terms
of
the
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
this
woman,
mrs.
peacock,
or
any
other
woman
who
is
married
and
has
a
child
at
home
certainly
negates
any
possibility
to
rationality
of
this
role
modeling
concept.
it
could
be
30
years
ago
that
a
woman
had
a
child
out
of
wedlock
and
she
could
be
married,
but
we
do
not
consider
that
that
is
relevant.
we
consider
that
illustrates
the
irrationality
of
the
role
modeling
concept
that
is
put
forward
here,
just
as
the
idea
that
dietitians
would
have
some
role
modeling
capacity
when
what
mr.
petty
said
at
the
hearing
was
“they
handle
food.”
ms.
rhonda
copelon
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
are
not
trying
to
litigate
this
for
dietitians.
we
are
simply
saying
that
when
you
look
at
the
way
this
rule
developed
and
how
it
is
articulated
and
you
look
at
the
justifications
placed
on
it,
the
origin
of
the
rule
and
its
scope
has
a
relevance
to
this
court’s
determination
as
to
its
rationality
to
our
clients.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
may
i
have
a
moment,
your
honor,
to
sum
up?
in
sum,
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
this
rule
violates
an
incredible
constellation
of
fundamental
rights
and
interests
recognized
by
this
court.
it
discriminates
against
black
people
only.
it
discriminates
against
women
only.
it
is
a
convenient
pretext
for
exclusion
from
the
employment
of
black
women
and
women
generally.
moreover,
it
intrudes
upon
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
in
our
supplemental
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
submitted
figures
which
show
the
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
--
and
a
substantial
increasing
number
of
white
people
just
in
the
period
that
this
rule
was
adapted.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
no,
it
is
a
minority.
i
think
it
is
25%
now
from
what
was
75%.
the
final
thing
that
this
rule
does
is
it
illustrates
the
perversion
of
roe
versus
wade.
this
court
has
removed
sanctions
on
premarital
sex.
it
has
rejected
the
idea
that
contraception
is
going
to
stop
that.
it
has
rejected
the
idea
that
not
having
abortion
is
going
to
stop
that.
it
has
rejected
the
idea
that
you
can
force
a
woman
to
bear
an
illegitimate
child
in
order
to
deter
premarital
sex.
what
we
have
here
in
area
--
in
a
time
when
abortion
is
available
is
an
inducement
to
abortion
and
so,
putting
it
all
together,
it
illustrates
that
the
black
woman,
the
minority
woman,
the
poor
woman
can
very
easily
be
the
first
victim
of
the
perversion
of
the
notion
of
reproductive
control.
ms.
rhonda
copelon
yes,
your
honor,
but
what
we
are
saying
under
the
keys’
opinion
is
--
ms.
rhonda
copelon
no,
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
that
context
of
whitening
the
faculty
is
something
which
just
led
this
court
to
look
at
neutral
rules
as
presenting
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.
thank
you.
