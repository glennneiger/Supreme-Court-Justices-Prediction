the
whole
school
population
goes
successfully
to
each
of
these
three
schools,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
counsel’s
distillation
or
trial
court’s
or
the
witnesses'
or
whose
is
it
exactly?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
rule
applies
to
much
more
than
just
teachers
and
teacher’s
aides,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
or
an
instructor
or
an
employee?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
just
about
everybody
except
maybe
the
people
who
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
night
when
the
students
are
out
you
do
janitorial
services,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
employees
specifically
this
personnel
policy
applied
in
addition
to
teachers
and
teacher’s
aide?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
was
not
certain,
how
could
anybody
else
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
gomillion
was
a
fifteenth
amendment
case?
justice
potter
stewart
fifteenth
amendment
is
not
implicated
here?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
talking
about
expert
testimony
in
this
case
on
both
sides
on
that
issue,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
an
equal
protection
clause
claim
because
the
way
you
are
arguing
it
does
not
sound
like
it
and
i
wondered?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
right,
the
equal
protection
clause
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
right,
you
would
prevail
on
that
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
this
school
district
to
require
that
no
teacher
should
be
hired
who
is
under
18
years
old?
justice
potter
stewart
protection-wise,
i
think
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
see
the
difference
as
a
part
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
neither
of
which
purports
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
what
percentage
of
the
teachers
in
the
school
system
were
negroes?
justice
potter
stewart
and
white
people?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
still
a
majority
of
negroes,
is
it
not?
no?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
as
a
rising
rate,
i
thought
it
just
showed
static
figures?
