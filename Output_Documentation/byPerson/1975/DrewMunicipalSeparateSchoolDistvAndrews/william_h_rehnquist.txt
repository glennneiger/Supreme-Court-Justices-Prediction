justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
was
filed
under
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
title
vii
conferred
a
private
right
of
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
either
of
these
respondents
marry
the
person
who
fathered
their
child?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
school
board
did,
ultimately
adapt
it,
did
it
not,
ratify
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
constitutional
significance
in
your
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
in
fact
the
body
charged
with
the
administering
the
school
district
does
ratify
it,
i
do
not
see
how
the
fact
that
--
someone
has
to
think
of
every
rule,
the
fact
that
a
board
member
rather
than
the
superintendent
thought
it
up
would
bear
on
the
rationality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcteer,
do
you
think
that
the
state
of
mississippi
could
prohibit
by
law
fornication
and
premarital
sex
if
it
wanted
to
and
make
it
a
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely,
if
you
are
charged
in
a
criminal
court
and
convicted
on
a
charge
i
thought
you
have
stigmatized
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
not
address
yourself
to
my
question?
is
your
contention
that
some
sort
of
proof
was
lacking
here
that
these
people
in
fact
had
sex
out
of
wedlock?
because
if
the
state
can
make
it
a
crime
to
do
that,
i
do
not
see
why
the
school
cannot
say
â€œif
you
in
fact
do
it,
you
are
not
fit
to
teach?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
concede
that
if
mississippi
was
to
make
it
a
criminal
offense
to
do
that
and
they
were
proven
to
have
done
it
by
a
jury,
they
could
go
to
jail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
answer
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcteer,
the
national
education
association
and
the
government
have
both
filed
amicus
briefs
suggesting
that
this
petition
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
does
your
client
take
a
position
on
that
question
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
was
whether
mississippi
could
make
either
fornication
or
rephrased
by
justice
stevens,
that
bearing
of
the
child
out
of
wedlock
could
impose
criminal
penalties
for
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
mississippi
could
make
adultery
a
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
copelon,
a
minute
ago
you
referred
to
the
scrutiny
given
by
this
court
in
cases
involving
sex,
what
scrutiny
do
you
conceive
that
to
be?
