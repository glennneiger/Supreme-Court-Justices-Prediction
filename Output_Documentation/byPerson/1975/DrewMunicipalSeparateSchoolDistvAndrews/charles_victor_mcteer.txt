mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
one
point,
i
would
like
to
make
this
issue
exactly
clear.
kay
d.
andrews
who
came
to
me
in
1973
is
now
married
and
she
is
married
to
a
young
man,
mr.
alonzo
peacock.
as
to
the
status
of
whether
or
not
he
was
the
father
of
the
child,
i
have
no
idea
whatsoever,
but
she
is
a
married
individual.
your
honors,
i
am
going
to
describe
to
you
in
this
divided
argument
the
basic
--
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
unfortunately,
your
honor,
it
is
not
in
this
record
at
this
time.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
i
would
expect
mere
logic,
your
honor,
if
the
fact
would
become
known
to
the
court,
to
demand
basically
that
the
court
might
be
helpful
--
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
i
understand,
sir.
however,
the
fact
is
evident.
i
would
discuss
the
basic
rationality
of
the
rule,
sir,
and
at
the
same
time
set
forth
the
rules’
racially
discriminatory
aspects.
my
co-council,
ms.
copelon,
will
set
forth
the
sexist
comminatory
aspects
of
the
rule
as
well
as
the
standard
of
review
and
the
basic
privacy
rights
which
we
claim
have
been
deprived
in
this
cause.
the
rule
precisely
stated,
notice
the
fact
that
all
teachers,
teacher’s
aides,
cafeteria
workers,
dietitians,
librarians,
gym
teachers,
secretaries,
principals,
pta
presidents,
nurses,
social
workers,
volunteer
workers
and
perhaps
even
maids,
janitors,
and
school
bus
drivers
who
have
ever
bore
or
site
a
child
out
of
wedlock
are
forever
barred
from
employment
of
a
drew
municipal
separate
school
district.
the
rule
was
solely
the
brainchild
of
georgia
petty,
who
had
enacted
this
rule
without
talking
to
any
member
of
a
faculty,
without
talking
to
any
principal,
supervisor,
adviser
and
made
this
rule
solely
upon
his
own
action.
in
fact,
the
school
board
did
not
even
know
the
rule’s
enactment
until
after
this
lawsuit
had
been
filed.
the
first
time
that
many
of
our
clients
were
aware
of
the
rule
was
after.
a
group
of
--
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
it
did
ratify
it.
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
face
of
the
record.
there
was
mere
approval
or
whether
there
is
a
majority
vote
or
a
unanimous
vote,
simple
ratification.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
only
as
to
the
basic
rationality,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
of
the
rule’s
application
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
are
saying
that
the
rule
was
solely
the
creation
of
mr.
petty.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
this
could
bear
on
the
rationality
only
as
to
the
concern
as
i
am
trying
to
point
out
here,
sir,
that
no
other
individuals
were
involved
in
the
creation
of
the
rule
until
after
this
lawsuit
became
evident.
no
one
else,
frankly,
knew
about
the
rule
until
this
became
evident.
certainly,
the
school
board
did
not
know
until
after
the
suit
was
filed.
doing
three
days
of
testimony,
before
the
united
states
district
court
in
greenville,
mississippi
and
numerous
depositions
which
were
taken,
these
defendants
attempt
to
set
forth
some
basic
rationality
for
the
rule.
they
claimed,
in
essence,
that
the
rule
is
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
a
proper
moral
climate
in
the
school
district
because
as
mr.
petty
testified,
all
unwed
parents
are
simply
immoral
people.
as
a
second
justification,
they
claim
that
the
rule
was
necessary
to
reduce
schoolgirl
pregnancies
because
somehow
or
another,
the
mere
presence
of
a
schoolgirl,
excuse
me,
the
mere
presence
of
an
unwed
parent
in
the
school
district
would
somehow
or
another
increase
schoolgirl
pregnancies
and
i
might
note
for
the
record
that
although
there
was
reference
to
28
schoolgirl
pregnancies,
there
was
no
reference
whatsoever
to
any
increase.
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
the
figures
had
increased
over
the
past
years
or
what.
we
just
know
that
there
were
28
schoolgirl
pregnancies
at
one
period
of
time.
in
their
most
recent
submission
before
this
court
last
week,
the
defendants
have
set
forth
a
third
justification.
that
third
justification
being
that
an
individual
who
is
an
unwed
parent
gives
the
appearance,
if
you
will,
of
impropriety.
i
trust
we
have
come
full
circle
now
back
to
our
morality
justification.
however,
the
question
decided
before
the
courts
below
and
the
question
which
is
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
or
not
all
unwed
parents
are
moral
lepers
so
infected
with
irredeemable
disease
that
they
actually
endanger
the
moral
development
of
children.
the
trial
courts
and
the
fifth
circuit
looking
at
this
basic
concept,
using
its
own
language,
noted
that
this
construct
was
patently
absurd,
mischievous,
prejudicial
and
would
only
create
stigma
where
it
had
never
been
evident
before.
the
courts
found
this
rule
to
be
clearly
irrational
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
morality
is
not
the
logical
consequence
of
unwed
parenthood
and
furthermore,
all
unwed
parents
are
simply
not
immoral.
but
more
importantly,
the
rule
completely
ignores
such
aspects
of
supposed
immorality
as
premarital
sex,
extramarital
sex.
the
rule
does
not
concern
itself
at
all
with
the
present
moral
worth
of
any
individual,
their
reputation
or
character.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
yes,
sir.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
can
use
such
criteria
for
the
purpose
of
stigmatizing
individuals
and
punishing
them.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
there
is
no
individual
in
this
court,
none
of
these
plaintiffs
have
been
charged
with
any
criminal
crime
or
violation.
these
women
have
attempted
to
rear
their
children
rather
than
kill
them
or
abort
them.
they
have
made
a
basic
decision.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
response
to
your
question,
i
am
trying
to
say
here
that
these
individuals
cannot
be
stigmatized
solely
on
the
basis
of
having
bore
a
child
out
of
wedlock.
if
the
goal
and
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
reduce
schoolgirl
pregnancies,
then
where
is
the
correlation
between
unwed
parenthood
and
an
increase
in
schoolgirl
pregnancies?
if
--
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
in
fact,
mr.
rehnquist,
the
rule
here,
as
evidenced
by
my
co-counsel’s
statement
--
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
i
am
answering,
i
am
trying
to,
sir,
i
am
trying
to.
having
sex
out
of
wedlock
is
not
a
disqualification
of
this
rule.
it
does
not
disqualify
you
from
employment
by
way
of
the
rule’s
operation.
bearing
a
child
out
of
wedlock
is
what
disqualifies
you.
you
can
have
extra
--
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
such
law
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
in
the
absence
of
a
showing,
your
honor,
that
that
criminal
act
was
directly
correlated
to
either
any
of
the
justified
purposes
of
the
rule,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
that
conviction
or
otherwise
evidence
to
be
a
criterion
of
employment.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
your
honor,
you
are
taking
me
from
the
entire
plather
of
criminal
acts
that
could
be
performed
by
a
school
teacher.
i
am
talking
about
women
who
are
having
children.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
to
answer
your
hypothetical
question,
i
am
trying
to
say
here
that
if
a
parent
bears
a
child
out
of
wedlock
or
a
woman
or
a
man
bears
a
child
or
sires
a
child
out
of
wedlock,
that
criterion
of
employment,
even
if
it
led
to
a
conviction
of
cohabitation
or
whatever
under
mississippi
law
is
not
a
justifiable
criterion
or
rationally
related
to
any
viable,
apparent
goal
of
the
school
district.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
your
honor,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
such
statute.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
your
honor,
that
question
-
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
that
would
bear
directly
upon
basic
fundamental
interest
this
court
has
recognized
as
to
the
decision
to
bear,
to
beget
a
child.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
i
would
certainly
make
that
statement
clearly
--
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
that
is
correct.
but,
your
honor,
this
becomes
more
evident
when
we
look
at
certain
factual
statements
and
background
that
is
evident
in
the
drew
area
and
perhaps,
i
can
explain
this
a
little
bit
more
clearly.
there
were
more
back
illegitimate
children
born
in
drew,
mississippi
for
a
five-year
period
from
1968-1971
than
total
white
legitimate
or
illegitimate
children
born
in
the
same
period.
80%
of
this
school
district
is
black.
the
facts
that
i
have
submitted
to
you
in
the
supplemental
brief
clearly
indicate
that
from
the
period
1968-1971,
the
number
of
black
faculty
members
at
the
drew
municipal
separate
school
district
which
was
desegregated
by
way
of
a
court
order,
15
years
after
brown
versus
board
of
education,
has
decreased
from
75%
at
the
a.w.
james
elementary
school
to
36%.
the
point
which
is
evident
is
that
this
rule,
by
its
operation,
your
honors,
can
only
affect
black
people
and
the
reason
why
it
can
only
effect
black
people
is
because
for
every
47
--
46
illegitimate
children
born
in
drew
mississippi,
only
one
is
a
black
--
a
white
child,
only
one
is
a
white
child.
this
is
a
clear
gomillion
case.
gomillion
is
clearly
applicable
here
because
the
state
has
created
a
social
policy
rather
than
municipal
boundaries
which
can
only
affect
black
people
and
as
a
consequence,
only
black
people
will
be
affected
by
the
rule’s
operation.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
it
certainly
was,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
but
i
would
have
presumed
that
basic
concepts
of
constitutional
laws,
they
reflect
upon
racial
discrimination
as
it
concerns
the
creation
of
racial
classifications
only
affecting
a
particular
racial
group
would
certainly
be
applicable.
the
only
individuals
that
have
been
stigmatized
or
eliminated
from
employment
by
this
rule’s
operation
were
five
black
women
and
although
the
defendants
in
this
cause
have
repeatedly
made
reference
to
the
supposed
right
of
individuals
to
bear
children
out
of
wedlock,
i
would
like
to
state
that
it
was
1868,
before
black
people
in
this
country
had
the
right
to
bear
children
in
the
wedlock
and
that
is
a
clear
consequence
of
the
enactment
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
i
do
not
have
to
say
anything
about
dred
scott.
it
is
clear
in
many
places
throughout
this
country
that,
as
judge
timmy
said
in
dred
scott
clearly,
black
people
had
no
rights
which
a
white
man
was
bound
to
expect
and
so,
as
a
consequence
of
this
rule’s
operation.
the
only
individuals
who
will
be
clearly
affected
by
the
rule’s
operation
are
black
people.
it
is
an
insurmountable
final
exclusion
from
employment.
“thou
shalt
not
work
if
thou
have
a
child
out
of
wedlock
in
drew,”
and
there
can
be
no
more
and
no
greater
stigmatizing
effect
upon
any
person,
particularly
young
black
women
who
went
to
college,
he
did
not
tell
you
that
katie
mae
andrews
peacock
had
a
college
degree
but
she
worked
nights
in
a
factory
in
order
to
get
to
it
and
she
had
a
child
while
she
was
still
in
high
school
and
it
was
four
years
later
when
the
rule
was
made
evident
to
her.
if
a
black
woman
struggles
through
high
school,
struggles
through
college,
and
then
at
the
moment
when
she
finally
gets
out
of
the
circle
of
poverty
is
told
that
because
she
bore
a
child
out
of
wedlock
four
years
ago
she
cannot
have
a
job,
then
indeed,
the
constitution
is
senseless
to
us
and
makes
no
possibility
for
any
change.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
charles
victor
mcteer
i
will
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
we
have
briefed
this
case
thoroughly
and
throughout
that
indeed,
we
recognize
the
fact
there
is
a
possibility
for
some
right
of
action
to
title
ix.
however,
there
is
no
clear
statement
under
title
ix
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action.
additionally,
under
title
vii,
i
might
note
that
at
one
time
we
did
try
to
create
this
action
via
title
vii
action,
but
in
1973
when
the
action
was
filed,
the
title
vii
amendments
had
just
been
put
into
effect
and
to
be
actually
honest
about
it,
your
honor,
eeoc
was
not
very
sure
as
to
whether
or
not
we
could
continue
with
this
cause
of
action
or
create
a
cause
of
action
against
the
school
district.
furthermore,
there
was
a
length
of
time
problem
involved
in
the
enactment
of
title
vii
and
the
period
of
time
it
takes
a
matter
resolved.
also,
your
honor,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
have,
here,
two
federal,
excuse
me,
a
federal
district
court
and
a
court
of
appeals
which
ruled
that
the
flagrant
nature
of
the
violation
here
was
so
evident
that
the
court
granted
injunctive
relief
within
four
months
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
and
finally,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
make
note
of
the
fact
that
in
the
cohen
case
mr.
justice
stewart
made
it
absolutely
clear
that
although
in
that
particular
factual
circumstance,
in
footnote
8
--
in
that
particular
factual
circumstance
it
might
be
evident
that
all
future
cases
would
be
governed
by
title
vii
clearly
as
to
these
individual
plaintiffs
and
respondents
the
court
could
actually
make
a
ruling.
and
so,
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
ask
that
the
nature
of
this
flagrant
constitutional
violation
be
made
evident.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
