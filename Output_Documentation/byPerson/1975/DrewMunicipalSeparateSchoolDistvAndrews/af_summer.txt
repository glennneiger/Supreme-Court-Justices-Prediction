mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
schempp
(ph)
attorney
from
indianola,
mississippi
representing
the
petitioners,
drew
municipal
separate
school
district
and
the
individuals,
the
superintendent
and
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
school
district.
the
court
has,
in
this
case,
permitted
divided
argument
for
both
petitioners
and
the
respondents
and
i
will
speak
first
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
and
mr.
allain
of
jackson,
mississippi
will
argue
in
rebuttal
for
the
petitioners.
i
think
that
it
is
important
in
this
particular
case
to
discuss
the
factual
background
against
which
the
rule
in
question
was
adapted.
the
town
of
drew,
mississippi
is
located
in
a
rural
area
of
the
mississippi
delta
in
sunflower
county,
mississippi
and
according
to
the
1970
census,
had
a
population
of
2,574.
the
school
district
is
comprised
of
the
town
of
drew
and
some
additional
territory,
added
territory
outside
the
town
and
within
the
county
of
sunflower.
the
entire
district
has
a
population
of
approximately
5,000-6,000
residents.
the
school
itself
is
divided
into
an
elementary
school,
a
junior
high
school
and
a
high
school
in
all
12
grades
of
approximately
1,200
students,
80%
of
which
at
the
time
of
this
litigation
were
black,
20%
white.
it
is
a
public
school
system
in
mississippi.
there
are
three
separate
schools.
there
is
hunter
high
school,
hunter
junior
high
school,
and
a.w.
james
elementary
school.
mr.
a.f.
summer
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.f.
summer
they
are
all,
mr.
justice
brennan,
within
the
town
of
drew.
they
are
scattered
locations
throughout
the
community.
the
school
system
is
fully
integrated
and
the
district
court
so
found
in
this
particular
case
that
it
is
fully
integrated
as
to
faculty,
staff
and
students.
during
the
school
year
1971-1972,
within
this
school
system,
there
were
28
schoolgirl
pregnancies,
requiring
those
children
13-17
years
of
age
to
be
forced
to
withdraw
from
school
to
give
birth
to
children
out
of
wedlock.
in
sunflower
county,
mississippi
alone,
the
statistics
in
this
record
as
introduced
by
the
respondents
as
an
exhibit,
in
the
record
and
is
incorporating
the
appendix,
the
statistics
for
1971
show
that
of
all
live
births
in
sunflower
county,
mississippi
35.2%
were
illegitimate.
now,
faced
with
this
situation,
the
alarming
rise
in
schoolgirl
pregnancies,
an
alarming
rate
of
illegitimate
birth
within
the
community
and
county,
the
superintendent
after
having
learned
of
the
fact
that
there
were
teachers
within
--
teacher's
aides
within
his
school
system
that
were
parents
of
children
born
out
of
wedlock.
mr.
petty,
the
superintendent
activated
his
rule,
and
i
will
discuss
the
rule
in
just
a
moment,
which
resulted
in
the
non-rehiring
of
one
of
the
respondents
herein
and
the
non-hiring
of
the
other
respondent
herein.
now,
the
rule
has
been
much
discussed.
it
was
not
a
codified
rule.
the
rule
was
mr.
petty’s
and
it
was
subsequently
approved
by
the
board
of
trustees.
i
would
like
to
state
what
we
feel
and
submit
to
the
court
what
constitutes
the
rule
that
no
individual
who
is
the
natural
parent
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
may
be
employed
in
the
drew
schools
as
a
teacher
or
a
teacher
aide
or
in
any
other
position
or
capacity
in
direct
contact
with
the
students
and
that
has
a
potential
role
model
status.
the
rule
was
to
regulate
the
status
and
not
the
present
morals
of
an
individual
seeking
employment.
now,
the
respondent,
rogers,
was
employed
during
the
1971-1972
school
year
as
a
teacher
aide.
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
justice
stevens,
this
is
from
a
distillation
of
the
testimony
in
the
record
and
the
way
the
rule
is
applied.
mr.
a.f.
summer
at
this
point,
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
counsel’s,
arrived
at
through
rereading
the
record
and
the
testimony
in
the
writing
and
the
application
of
the
rule.
mr.
a.f.
summer
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.f.
summer
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
does.
it
would
affect
any
individual
that
had
direct
contact
with
the
students
and
who
served
in
a
role
model
capacity,
in
other
words,
an
individual
to
whom
the
students
relate
and
look
up
in
role
model
status.
mr.
a.f.
summer
the
cafeteria
warden
is
--
mr.
a.f.
summer
correct,
i
think
the
superintendent
was
unclear
at
the
time
of
his
testimony
as
to
whether
it
would
affect
school
bus
drivers
and
some
such
things
as
this
now,
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
would
affect
anyone
to
whom
the
students
could
relate
in
a
role
model
capacity
and
it
would,
in
the
district’s
opinion,
have
an
impact
upon
their
learning
experience.
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
exactly
right.
i
think
it
has
been
designated
as
a
rule.
it
is
not
codified.
it
is
not
written.
i
think
you
are
correct
in
saying
it
is
a
policy
of
employment.
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
has
been
no
other
individual
within
the
school
system
that
has
been
caught
by
this
rule
and
excluded
from
employment
other
than
teachers
and
teacher’s
aides.
now,
a
reading
of
the
record
will
reflect
that
the
superintendent,
at
the
time
of
his
testimony,
was
not
completely
certain
as
to
the
full
application
of
the
rule.
i
think
it
had
to
be
taken
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
a.f.
summer
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
--
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
was
not
certain
as
to
the
particular
jobs
--
he
would
have
to
look
at
the
particular
job
at
the
particular
time.
in
other
words,
he
was
questioned
and
it
is
in
the
appendix,
his
testimony
in
the
appendix
on
cross-examination
begins
on
page
35,
and
he
was
questioned
at
length
about
this.
reading
on
page
38
of
the
appendix,
he
was
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not
the
policy
would
extend
to
teachers
and
his
answer
was
yes,
to
teacher’s
aides?
“yes,”
librarians?
“yes,”
extends
to
gym
teacher?
“yes.”
would
it
extend
to
a
cafeteria
worker?
“yes,
i
have
never
had
that
to
occur,
but
i
think
it
would,
yes.”
what
about
a
secretary?
“yes,”
a
janitor?
“i
am
not
sure
about
a
janitor.”
why
not?
his
answer
was
“a
janitor
runs
into
children
each
day.
i
think
each
one
of
us
can
remember
some
janitor
who
gave
us
candy
or
was
close
to
us.”
would
it
extend
to
a
janitor,
that
is
still
a
question,
his
answer
is
“i
do
not
know.
it
has
not
occurred
and
i
have
not
made
the
decision
yet.”
would
it
extend
to
a
bus
driver?
no
response,
a
school
bus
driver?
“i
cannot
say.”
would
it
extend
to
a
nurse?
“yes,”
a
social
worker?
“well,
if
we
had
a
social
worker,”
a
principal?
“yes,”
a
party
who
volunteers
to
do
schoolwork
or
to
work
with
teachers?
his
answer
was
“if
we
had
those,
it
would,
yes.”
would
you
object
to
a
pta
president
on
the
basis
of
his
unwed
parenthood?
“i
would.”
mr.
a.f.
summer
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
the
two
involved,
this
was
not
a
class
action,
the
only
two
individuals
involved
were
applicants
--
one
was
an
applicant
for
teacher
aide
position
and
the
other
--
mr.
a.f.
summer
our
position
is,
we
do
not
and
our
brief
so
reflects
that
these
individuals
who
were
caught
by
the
rule
cannot
be
put
in
a
position
of
asking
this
rule
be
stricken
down
because
some
other
individual
might
be
caught
by
it.
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
justice
marshal,
it
was
disseminated
through
the
staff
level
of
the
school
by
the
superintendent
down
to
the
individuals
responsible
for
recommending
the
teachers
for
employment.
mr.
a.f.
summer
and
to
the
teachers
through
the
principals,
that
is
correct.
going
back
to,
and
it
may
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
give
a
little
background
on
the
respondents
involved,
the
respondent,
rogers,
who
was
employed
and
was
in
the
employee
of
the
school
district
from
1971
to
1972
school
year,
served
as
a
teacher
aide.
now,
teacher
aides
are
not
teachers
as
such.
they
assist
the
teachers.
they
have
probably
more
direct
contact
with
the
students
than
the
teachers
themselves.
they
go
with
the
students
to
recess,
to
the
cafeteria.
they
assist
them
in
different
activities
throughout
the
day.
the
respondent
rogers,
serving
in
this
capacity,
was
single
and
had
one
child
which,
there
is
no
question,
there
is
no
conflict
of
evidence
to
the
fact
that
this
child
was
born
out
of
wedlock.
she
was
notified
during
the
spring
of
1972
that
she
would
not
be
reemployed
for
the
1972-1973
school
year.
at
the
time
she
was
notified,
she
was
pregnant
with
the
second
child
and
still
was
not
married.
now,
the
respondent,
andrews,
made
application
for
a
teacher’s
aide
position
in
december
of
1972.
her
application
indicated
that
she
was
single
and
had
no
children
when
in
fact
she
did
have
one
minor
child
which
was
born
out
of
wedlock.
a
routine
investigation
into
this
individual’s
qualifications
for
employment
revealed
that
she
did
in
fact
have
one
child.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
no
one
was
fired
as
a
result
of
this
policy,
only
not
employed.
now,
in
february
1973,
this
suit
was
filed
in
united
states
district
court
not
as
a
class
action.
hearings
were
held
during
march
through
may
of
1973.
the
suit
was
filed
under
42
u.s.c.
1981,
1983
title
vi
and
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
of
course
we
submit
to
the
court
that
is
not
a
title
vii
case.
it
has
never
been
played,
the
procedures
were
not
followed
--
the
administrative
procedures
were
not
followed.
mr.
a.f.
summer
they
alleged
in
their
complaint,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
this
was
a
violation
of
title
vii
and
as
i
understand
title
vii,
it
was
--
mr.
a.f.
summer
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
it
does.
mr.
a.f.
summer
yes.
now,
the
district
court,
after
exhaustive
evidentiary
hearings,
found
that
the
rule
policy
had
no
rational
basis
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
made
and
in
the
alternative,
the
court
took
a
further
step
and
declared
that
the
policy
created
a
discriminatory
classification
based
upon
sex
and
that
the
school
district
had
the
burden
of
showing
a
compelling
state
interest
and
struck
down
the
policy
on
both
grounds.
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
issues
of
race
or
privacy
that
were
urged
upon
it
by
the
respondents.
an
injunction
was
issued
to
the
school
district
compelling
the
school
district
to
employ
these
individuals.
on
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
traditional
equal
protection
grounds
and
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
on
any
other
issues,
including
the
issue
of
sex
or
race.
now,
it
is
of
our
position
that
given
the
factual
background
in
this
particular
case
that
the
rule
has
a
rational
basis
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
adapted
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
purpose
for
which
this
rule
was
adapted
was
an
attempt
by
the
school
district
to
curb
an
alarming
rate
of
illegitimate
births
within
the
school
population
itself.
the
respondents
say
that
there
were
other
methods
to
do
this,
but
we
submit
this
was
the
only
way
that
the
school
district
could
handle
this
situation.
there
were
other
ways
it
could
be
augmented
--
that
could
augment
this
policy,
but
as
suggested
by
respondents,
to
give
sex
education
is
good,
to
provide
contraceptive
devices
is
good,
but
for
the
school
district
to
give
tacit
approval
to
this
status
of
parenthood
out
of
wedlock
of
children
that
this
permitting
that
to
remain
and
this
as
a
policy
of
their
school
district
to
permit
these
people
to
teach
would
undermine
any
of
the
method
that
they
attempted
to
enact
to
curb
this
situation.
it
is
our
position
that
an
individual
in
that
status
is
an
improper
role
model.
now,
the
expert
testimony
is
to
the
effect
that
teachers,
and
i
think
this
court
has
own
record
that
teachers
are
in
a
very
sensitive
area
in
a
classroom
where
young
minds
are
molded
and
shaped
for
the
future
where
ideals
are
instilled
upon
them,
the
morays
of
society
and
they
are
some
moral
overtones
involved.
we
submit
that
this
--
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
reflect
that.
we
take
the
position
there
that
the
potential
exists,
whether
it
in
fact
existed
at
that
time,
that
the
potential
knowledge
exits
and
once
that
knowledge
does
exist,
the
knowledge
may
not
exist
today,
but
it
could
exist
tomorrow
in
a
small
rural
school
district
where
people
know
their
neighbors
and
know
what
their
neighbors
are
doing
and
they
know
about
their
teachers
and
what
their
teachers
are
doing,
that
knowledge
is
readily
obtainable
in
a
situation
such
as
this
and
once
that
knowledge
is
obtained,
that
the
effectiveness
of
that
teacher
is
completely
destroyed.
if
a
teacher
admits
that
she
does
--
he
or
she
does
in
fact
have
a
child
out
of
wedlock,
then
if
the
student
has
respected
that
teacher,
then
we
feel
that
the
child
loses
some
respect.
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
only
elicited
on
cross-examination,
her
purpose.
this
was
respondent
andrews,
her
purpose
in
falsifying
her
application.
her
only
responsibility
is
that
she
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
policy
in
order
to
get
a
job,
the
only
way
she
can
get
a
job
was
falsify
application
in
this
regard.
mr.
a.f.
summer
in
the
trial
of
this
matter,
it
did
not
go
beyond
that.
no,
sir.
i
saved
it
--
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
is
correct.
this
was
much
discussed
in
the
lower
courts.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
once
an
individual,
male
or
female,
black
or
white,
has
a
child
out
of
wedlock,
if
they
fall
into
a
status
at
that
point
of
having
an
illegitimate
child,
regardless
of
a
change
in
circumstances,
they
still
remain
in
that
status.
mr.
a.f.
summer
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
they
have.
no,
sir.
mr.
a.f.
summer
there
has
one
--mr.
justice
blackmun,
one
that
has
married
subsequent
to
the
litigation.
mr.
a.f.
summer
it
would
be
outside
the
record,
that
is
correct
and
quite
frankly,
i
do
not
know
whether
this
would
be
the
father
of
the
child
or
not.
thank
you.
mr.
a.f.
summer
that
is
correct.
