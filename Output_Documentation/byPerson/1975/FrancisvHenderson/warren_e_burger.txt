chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
francis
against
henderson.
mr.
rogow,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
regard
the
lawyer
as
ineffective
or
incompetent
in
trying
a
capital
case
because
he
had
never
tried
a
capital
case
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
a
per
se
rule
would
mean
that
the
first
capital
case
any
lawyer
tried
would
automatically
be
open
to
your
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
really
very
important
in
one
or
the
other
whether
defense
counsel
has
ever
tried
a
capital
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
automatically
equate
it
with
a
self-evaluation
of
any
effectiveness
when
a
lawyer
seeks
to
have
another
and
associate
with
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
we
are
doing,
these
questions
are
going
to
the
merit
of
the
standards
that
you
set
up?
they
are
your
standards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
experienced
lawyers
when
they
finish
a
case
to
feel
the
result
is
a
bad
result
or
an
unjust
result
that
they
would
not
take
a
new
trial
under
any
circumstances,
prepared
of
having
a
worst
result?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
so
in
civil
cases,
criminal
cases,
all
kinds
of
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
something
worse
than
the
sentence
he
got
have
been
imposed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
even
if
it
is
technically
inappropriate,
it
is
not
a
very
pleasant
sentence
to
have
come
to
you,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
your
arguments
would
be
addressed
against
a
man,
alleged
to
have
been
one
of
the
great
criminal
lawyers
of
all
time
when
he
represented
global
and
liverpool
(ph)
some
40
or
50
years
ago
and
saved
their
lives
as
he
thought
by
getting
them
life
sentences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
have
dwelt
at
some
length
by
mentioning
it
several
times
that
you
borrowed
some
forms
from
the
prosecutor.
is
it
not
again
a
matter
of
common
human
experience
and
practice
of
law,
the
court-appointed
counsel
and
frequently
not
a
court-appointed
counsel
will
go
and
consult
with
the
prosecutor
about
the
great
many
things
and
getting
suggestions
from
him.
all
prosecutors
are
not
filled
with
hostility.
in
fact,
many
of
them
are
trying
to
cooperate
with
the
defense
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
fact
that
he
borrowed
a
form
for
whatever
it
was
is
no
more
important
than
even
the
fact
that
he
borrowed
the
form
of
subpoena
from
the
clerk?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
motion
for
continuance,
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
until
that
time
he
had
not
decided
that
he
wanted
a
continuance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
i
think
will
not
ask
you
if
you
argue
for
two
minutes
today.
we
will
let
you
begin
afresh
in
the
morning
at
10
oâ€™clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
francis
against
henderson.
mrs.
rutledge.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
were
making
points,
a
little
earlier
with
reference
to
the
appendix,
were
you
referring
to
page
26
where
mr.
amadi
announced
that
the
motions
having
been
made,
the
motion
to
quash
because
mr.
turow
did
not
want
to
do
it
because
there
were
blacks
on
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury
panel
and
that
he
had
his
own
ideas
about
those
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rutledge.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
rogow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
only
evidence
on
that
is
on
page
26
and
this
co-counsel
said
that
he
did
not
recall
whether
he
had
discussed
it
with
mr.
turow
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
of
the
opinion
he
would
not
have
done
it
because
mr.
turow
is
a
man
who
does
not
believe
in
what
he
calls
wasted
effort?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
a
skill
of
lawyer
frequently
and
his
own
judgment
of
the
matter
because
of
the
last
line
on
that
same
page,
the
witness
mr.
amadi
said
he
knew
that
these
motions
made
in
quite
a
few
cases
and
that
they
were
often
made
so
that
there
is
not
a
matter
overlooking
them,
but
rather
does
this
record
not
show
that
it
was
a
matter
of
the
judgment
of
a
lawyer
that
there
was
no
point
in
making
the
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
his
co-counsel
and
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
the
record,
unless
you
can
point
to
some
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
ever
a
case
tried
in
any
court
that
after
the
event
someone
could
not
have
concluded
that
perhaps
if
he
had
done
something
else
things
might
have
been
better?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
such
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
your
practice
i
take
it
is
not
been
new
orleans?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
the
based
elsewhere?
there
were
two
very,
very
experienced
lawyers
knowing
the
situation
in
new
orleans,
knowing
the
availability
of
this
motion
and
indicating
on
this
record
that
mr.
amadi
have
made
such
motions
in
some
cases
and
then
his
explanation
is
it
was
not
done
because
it
would
have
been
wasted
motion.
now,
if
you
got
a
third
lawyer
in
perhaps
he
would
have
a
different
point
of
view.
but
how
can
a
court
11
or
12
years
after
the
event
try
to
second
guess
the
judgment
of
experience
of
trial
lawyers
familiar
with
the
practices
in
that
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
if
it
is
still
be
remedied,
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
an
expert
trial
lawyer,
he
would
not
have
moved
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
four
or
five
months
he
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rogow.
thank
you
mrs.
rutledge.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-5808
francis
against
henderson
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
