mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
davis
versus
united
states
or
fay
versus
noia,
sets
the
applicable
standards
for
determining
access
to
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
for
a
state
defendant
whose
lawyer
failed
to
make
a
timely
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
our
position
is
that
davis
does
not
apply
to
this
case,
but
if
this
court
holds
that
davis
does
apply,
then
francis
has
met
the
test
of
davis
which
his
cause
shown.
he
has
met
that
test
because
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
which
he
received.
obviously,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
important.
they
are
largely
undisputed.
francis
was
indicted
on
december
10,
1964.
he
was
17-years
old.
he
was
indicted
on
the
charge
of
felony
murder.
the
maximum
penalty
in
louisiana
for
felony
murder
was
death.
a
lawyer
was
appointed
to
represent
francis
two
months
later.
that
lawyer
is
mr.
a.
p.
turow
(ph)
of
new
orleans.
turow
was
appointed
and
if
he
were
going
to
file
a
grand
jury
challenge
on
the
basis
of
exclusion
of
blacks,
he
would
have
had
to
file
that
challenge
by
march
4,
1965
which
was
three
days
after
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
francis.
turow
did
not
file
that
motion.
indeed,
turow
filed
no
motion
in
this
case
until
the
day
before
trial.
turow
recognizing
his
own
inexperience
associated
with
himself
another
lawyer
from
new
orleans,
mr.
amadi
(ph).
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
say
he
was
inexperienced
in
this
kind
of
case
mr.
justice.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
justice
marshall,
he
had
not
handled,
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear,
he
had
not
handled
a
capital
case
in
15
years.
he
had
not
handled
the
criminal
case
in
many
years.
i
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
all
the
testimony
in
this
case
in
the
record
is
built
upon
the
testimony
of
amadi,
the
counsel
that
turow
associated.
he
associated
with
mr.
amadi,
according
to
mr.
amadi
because
he
was
inexperience
in
handling
criminal
cases
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
handled
a
capital
case
in
15
years.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
per
se.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case,
we
are
not
only
talking
about
the
fact
that
it
had
been
15
years
since
he
handled
a
capital
case.
we
are
talking
about
the
whole
series
of
events
which
we
think
support
the
proposition
that
he
did
not
do
the
job
that
he
should
have
done
in
protecting
francis’
rights.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
that
is
why
we
do
not
advocate
a
per
se
rule
mr.
chief
justice.
we
do
not
say
that
because
this
is
the
first
case
in
15
years.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
think
it
is
important.
obviously
the
stakes
in
a
capital
case
are
very
high
and
quite
frankly
the
acceptance
of
an
appointment
in
a
capital
case,
if
this
were
your
first
capital
case
is
one
which
i
think
the
lawyer
ought
to
take
with
great
consideration
and
give
some
thought
to
it,
if
you
are
going
to
do
it
by
himself.
turow
obviously
felt
he
could
not
do
it
by
himself
and
he
associated
counsel
with
himself.
that
counsel
is
mr.
amadi
who
was
associated
as
a
trial
expert
because
of
turow’s
feeling
i
believe
himself
that
he
was
inexperienced.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
would
not.
i
think
though
in
the
fact
of
this
case
and
if
i
may
develop
those
facts
i
think
the
court
would
begin
to
see
why
each
of
these
different
facts
which
we
put
forth
are
part
of
the
total
picture
representing
the
ineffectiveness
of
assistance
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir
and
the
standards
are
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
not
merely
on
the
fact
that
it
had
been
15
years
since
he
last
handled
a
capital
case,
but
that
is
one
factor.
another
factor
is
that
no
motion
was
filed
until
the
day
before
trial
and
that
first
motion
that
was
filed
in
this
case
on
the
day
before
trial,
june
23
was
a
motion
for
continuance
on
a
form
borrowed
from
the
district
attorney’s
office
which
was
struck
through
by
mr.
turow
to
accommodate
it
for
francis’
use.
that
motion
for
continuance
filed
as
i
said
just
the
day
before
trial,
the
very
first
motion
filed
in
this
capital
case
saw
the
continuance
so
that
turow
could
have
time
to
file
additional
motions
in
francis’
defense.
the
motion
for
continuance
was
denied.
on
that
same
day,
three
other
motions
were
filed.
one
was
a
prayer
for
oyer
which
is
a
form
of
discovery
under
louisiana
law,
another
motion
for
bill
of
particulars.
the
third
was
a
motion
challenging
the
grand
jury
indictment
only
on
vagueness
grounds
and
of
course
it
did
not
involve
the
exclusion
of
black
question.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
fact
that
those
motions
were
filed
the
day
before
trial
is
just
one
more
factor
to
be
considered.
the
form
of
those
motions,
on
a
form
borrowed
from
the
district
attorney,
at
least
the
motion
for
continuance
was
borrowed
from
district
attorney,
is
one
more
factor
to
be
considered.
on
the
day
of
trial,
a
fourth
motion
was
filed.
that
motion
was
one
to
suppress
the
statements
which
francis
had
allegedly
given.
the
motion
to
suppress
was
filed.
it
was
denied
without
a
hearing
and
the
record
of
this
case
reflects
that
no
exception
was
taken
to
that
denial
without
a
hearing,
although
an
exception
was
required
under
louisiana
law
and
so
one
more
example
of
the
factors
which
we
say
taken
in
their
totality
begin
to
speak
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
francis
was
tried
on
june
24,
1965.
he
was
convicted
on
that
day
and
five
days
later,
he
was
sentenced.
he
was
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
there
was
no
appeal
taken
from
that
conviction.
the
record
is
clear
that
francis
knew
of
his
right
to
an
appeal,
wanted
an
appeal
and
yet
no
appeal
was
taken
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
mr.
amadi
gave
for
not
taking
the
appeal
was
that
he
and
mr.
turow
did
not
want
to
make
this
case
a
life’s
work.
they
felt
that
the
jury
by
sparing
the
life
of
francis
had
done
enough,
and
therefore,
no
appeal
was
taken.
now,
what
we
are
saying
is
all
of
those
facts
together
begin
to
--
more
than
begin,
all
of
those
facts
together
show
that
francis’
counsel
was
ineffective
and
did
not
offer
him
the
kind
of
protection
which
ought
to
have
been
offered.
so
any
presumption
of
the
effectiveness
was
overcome
by
these
facts.
francis
later
applied
to
the
louisiana
trial
court
for
habeas
corpus,
claiming
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
appeal
and
also
claiming
that
blacks
have
been
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
the
application
was
denied.
it
was
denied
essentially
because
francis
had
not
made
a
timely
challenge
and
under
the
applicable
louisiana
statute,
if
one
did
not
make
a
timely
challenge
to
the
grand
jury,
then
the
right
to
challenge
a
grand
jury
was
absolutely
barred
and
because
of
that
absolute
forfeiture
rule,
francis
had
no
opportunity
to
raise
this
issue
in
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
to
fully
develop
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
cause
or
whether
or
not
he
waived
the
right
to
challenge
the
grand
jury.
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
after
the
louisiana
supreme
court
that
denied
certiorari
on
the
case.
the
district
court
for
this
in
the
district
of
louisiana
granted
francis'
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
finding
that
francis
did
not
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
be
indicted
by
a
fairly
constituted
grand
jury,
finding
any
alternative
that
if
the
test
with
that
of
davis
cause
shown
then
francis
had
met
that
test
by
virtue
of
the
inexperience
of
his
counsel
in
this
proceeding.
the
court
also
found
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
francis
did
indeed
exclude
blacks
and
they
vacated
the
indictment,
set
aside
the
conviction
and
ordered
the
state
to
re-indict
and
retry
francis
if
it
so
desired.
the
state
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
davis
test
is
the
applicable
test,
not
the
fay
versus
noia
test.
but
it
held
that
the
davis
test
in
this
case
because
of
the
absolute
forfeiture
rule
in
louisiana,
would
require
francis
to
show
prejudice,
not
cause
which
is
what
davis
speaks
of,
but
prejudice.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
has
taken
two
positions.
when
there
have
been
state
rules
which
parallel
rule
12
(b)
(2),
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
a
state
defendant
must
show
cause.
but
in
louisiana
because
the
rule
is
one
of
absolute
forfeiture,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
francis
must
show
more
than
cause.
he
must
show
actual
prejudice.
our
position
is
first,
that
davis
does
not
apply.
davis
does
not
applied
because
it
turns
upon
the
fact
that
congress
by
adapting
rule
12
(b)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
set
a
new
standard
for
determining
waiver
and
that
standard
is
one
of
cause.
so,
congress'
action
vis-a-vis
2255
is
what
davis
turns
upon.
there
is
no
analogous
provision
regarding
2254.
congress
has
not
in
any
way
limited
access
under
2254,
except
by
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
requirement
which
is
written
into
the
statute.
so
we
say
davis
does
not
apply,
but
if
the
court
would
find
that
davis
does
apply
then
we
believe
francis
has
met
the
test
of
davis.
that
test
is
one
of
cause
because
the
rule
speaks
of
cause.
davis
speaks
of
cause
and
one
of
the
touchstones
of
cause
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
francis’
counsel
was
ineffective,
especially
as
to
protecting
this
very
basic
constitutional
right
which
he
was
entitled
to.
the
state
has
argued
that
the
davis
test
should
apply
because
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
federal
government
are
the
same.
if
the
interest
of
the
state
and
the
federal
government
are
the
same
then
the
test
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
different
your
honor,
but
we
do
have
a
situation
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
that
is
what
davis
says.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
that
is
one
of
the
factors
used
to
determine
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
am
sorry,
you
say,
what
else
is
there?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
the
only
cause
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
that
probably
is
a
fair
assessment
that
fact
certainly
is
essential
to
our
analysis
of
the
case
if
davis
is
the
test.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
we
claim
that
only
turow
was
responsible
for
anything
that
happened
prior
to
trial
because
by
amadi’s
testimony,
he
said
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
turow
may
have
done
before
he
came
into
the
case
and
before
he
told
turow
to
file
the
prayer
for
oyer
and
motion
for
bill
of
particulars.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
mere
fact
that
amadi
tried
over
100
murder
cases,
we
do
not
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
think
that
if
the
court
got
that
impression,
i
apologize
for
it.
i
use
that
only
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
are
saying
that
turow
was
certainly
incompetent,
based
upon
the
record
that
we
have
in
front
of
us.
whether
or
not
amadi
did
a
competent
job
in
helping
francis
at
trial,
actually
we
do
not
know
because
there
is
no
record
of
this
trial
proceeding,
since
no
appeal
was
taken,
no
record
was
transcribed.
but
while
i
do
not
call
into
question
amadi’s
credentials
really
at
this
point
because
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
because
turow
had
the
responsibility
for
the
period
of
time
that
we
are
concerned
about.
i
think
that
the
other
factors
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
fact
that
no
exception
was
taken
to
the
denial
of
motion
to
suppress,
the
fact
that
no
appeal
was
taken
and
amadi
said
they
do
not
want
to
make
this
their
life's
work,
that
also
makes
one
question
the
effectiveness
of
amadi
for
francis
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
sir?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
doubt
that
in
some
cases
that
is
certainly
a
consideration,
although
in
some
ways
it
was
stated
as
one
of
the
considerations
in
this
case
by
amadi
saying
that
he
felt
that
if
francis
came
back
for
new
trial,
he
might
get
a
consecutive
30
years
sentence
upon
a
pending
robbery
charge,
although
the
record
on
this
case
reflects
that
that
kind
of
consecutive
sentence
had
never
been
given
in
orleans
parish
and
perhaps
could
not
even
be
given
under
the
applicable
louisiana
law..
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
death
penalty?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly,
perhaps
it
could
have
been
imposed,
although
questions
are
raised
about
that
on
a
success
of
trial,
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
would
have
been
appropriate
to
be
imposed,
that
question
was
not
resolved
at
that
time
of
course.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir.
i
agree,
but
i
think
it
is
important
once
again
that
i
stress
that
it
is
not
any
single
one
of
these
factors
that
supports
our
argument
that
turow
and
amadi
were
ineffective.
it
is
all
of
these
arguments
taken,
all
of
these
facts
taken
together.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
i
am
sure
that
counsel
in
that
case
did
not
wait
until
the
day
before
trial
to
file
motions
and
borrow
forms
from
district
attorney
or
co-
defendants
in
the
case
in
filing
the
motions.
i
understand
your
position
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
think
that
perhaps
the
fact
that
no
appeal
was
taken
looked
at
by
itself
could
be
explained
in
someway.
this
record
does
not
explain
it
though.
that
is
not
one
of
the
reasons
given
in
this
record
and
as
i
say
it,
if
one
looks
at
the
total
record;
one
has
to
wonder
about
the
effectiveness
of
assistance
received
by
francis
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
know
that
mr.
turow
practiced
for
a
long
time
in
new
orleans.
we
know
that
he
practiced
in
civil
rights
cases
in
new
orleans,
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
fact
in
and
off
itself
overcomes
the
facts
that
we
have
developed
in
this
record.
if
the
court
is
saying
that
he
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact,
that
mr.
turow
was
an
exceptional
lawyer,
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
i
do
not
want
to
be
trapped
into
the
position
that
necessarily
is
the
proper
test
because
as
i
have
said,
we
think
that
phase
of
proper
test
which
is
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver
which
would
not
turn
upon
a
showing
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
but
if
davis
is
the
proper
test,
we
think
that
merely
not
filing
the
grand
jury
challenge
perhaps
is
not
sufficient
to
show
cause
in
and
of
itself
because
the
court
talks
about
in
davis
and
in
chadwell
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
in
davis,
the
court
notes
that
the
fifth
circuit
viewed
davis’
lawyers
as
being
extremely
competent.
in
chadwell,
the
defendants
were
represented
by
the
same
lawyers
twice
before
this
court.
we
think
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
important
factors.
now,
when
one
looks
at
those
cases,
one
would
have
to
examine
all
of
the
facts
in
the
case
not
just
the
fact
that
they
did
not
file
the
timely
grand
jury
challenge
and
we
say
when
all
the
facts
are
at
looked
at
in
this
case,
any
presumption
of
competence
which
may
attach
has
been
overcome.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
cannot
dispute
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
think
that
it
is
more
important.
quite
frankly,
maybe
this
is
too
subjective,
but
i
think
it
is
offensive
in
a
capital
case
where
man’s
life
is
at
stake.
a
young
man’s
life
in
this
case
that
motions
are
filed
the
day
before
trial
and
they
are
not
just
borrowed
for
the
sake
of
following
the
form.
the
whole
form
itself
is
borrowed
and
the
lawyer
with
a
pen
strikes
through
the
district
attorney’s
name
and
writes
in
his
own.
that
seems
to
me
to
show
that
not
much
preparation
is
going
into
this
kind
of
motion.
that
one
is
doing
it
perhaps
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
or
last
minute
and
certainly
it
was
last
minute
in
this
case.
it
is
day
the
before
trial,
turow
is
appointed
on
february
9,
his
first
motion
is
on
june
23.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
perhaps
that
is
true,
but
he
had
known
prior
to
that
time
that
he
might
have
wanted
the
statements
that
francis
allegedly
made
and
that
prayer
for
oyer
or
motion
of
bill
of
particulars
is
directed
to
that.
he
certainly
should
have
known
about
that
prior
to
the
day
before
trial.
that
motion
could
have
been
made
ten.
as
i
say,
i
think
that
it
is
wrong
to
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir
and
turow
has
since
died
of
course,
but
the
only
explanation
we
have
is
that
of
amadi
in
the
case
and
so
amadi’s
testimony
has
to
be
the
testimony
to
be
looked
at
in
determining
why
the
motion
was
not
filed
and
what
if
anything
turow
did.
of
course
our
position
is
that
fay
versus
noia
provides
the
applicable
standards,
if
we
are
right
about
fay
versus
noia,
then
the
question
of
cause
does
not
come
into
play
at
all
and
in
this
situation,
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
was
no
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver
made
by
mr.
francis.
there
is
no
deliberate
bypass
made.
the
record
does
not
reflect
a
deliberate
bypass.
strategic
decision
made
by
francis
nor
even
by
mr.
turow
and
if
fay
versus
noia
is
a
proper
standard
then
abraham
francis
has
met
that
test
too.
and
we
think
it
is
a
especially
appropriate
to
use
fay
versus
noia
test
in
this
case
because
the
right
that
is
involved
here
is
a
very
important
right,
one
recognized
by
the
court
from
strauder
versus
west
virginia
to
alexander
versus
louisiana
in
1972.
one
that
is
embodied
in
a
federal
criminal
statute
18
u.s.c.,
section
243
which
makes
it
a
federal
offense
to
exclude
blacks
from
grand
jury
and
predatory
processes.
and
so
we
think
that
it
is
very
important
that
a
defendant
have
an
opportunity,
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
raise
this
basic
constitutional
right.
we
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
cut
it
short
by
imposing
actual
prejudice
test,
a
test
that
places
a
state
defendant
in
a
much
more
difficult
position
than
a
federal
defendant
in
davis
versus
united
states,
that
just
cannot
be.
the
purposes
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
act,
passed
in
1867,
show
that
it
was
meant
to
implement
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
ratified
in
1865
and
1868
respectively
and
looking
at
that
together
with
18
u.s.c.,
section
243,
passed
in
1875,
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
right
is
an
important
right
and
francis
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
vindicate
it
in
federal
habeas
croups
proceedings.
and
we
believe
that
that
he
can
vindicate
it
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
under
fay
versus
noia.
if
davis
is
applicable
in
this
case,
we
believe
he
should
have
access
under
the
cause
shown
test
of
davis
and
he
has
met
that
test,
and
therefore,
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
in
applying
any
harsh
new
test.
we
will
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
if
indeed
there
is
any
left.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
of
course,
our
position
is
that
fay
versus
noia
standard
is
the
applicable
standard
and
when
–-
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
certainly
is
not
what
fay
versus
noia
stands
for
and
we
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do
not
think
that
henry
versus
mississippi
answers
that
directly
either,
but
henry
of
course
permits
federal
habeas
corpus,
leaves
open
the
question
of
the
availability
of
federal
habeas
corpus
after
this
court’s
decision,
but
i
think
in
addressing
this
question,
of
whether
not
there
has
been
a
deliberate
bypass,
a
very
interesting
point
has
been
raised
and
that
is
if
that
is
the
test
and
if
that
is
the
test
that
the
bypass
can
be
either
by
counsel
or
by
the
defendant,
then
let
us
look
at
what
tactical
reason
existed
for
turow
to
bypass
this
challenge.
the
answer
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
suggested,
but
it
is
suggested
in
the
context
of
a
trial
that
is
going
on
at
that
moment
where
a
quick
decision
has
to
be
made
by
a
lawyer.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
there
would
have
been
time
in
this
case
to
make
that
challenge
without
having
to
worry
about
turning
to
consult
the
client
during
the
trial
itself.
i
think
if
there
has
to
be
a
line
drawn
about
whether
or
not
deliberate
bypass
can
be
made
by
counsel,
it
would
have
to
be
drawn
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy
during
the
trial
itself
when
there
is
not
time
to
consult
with
counsel.
here
we
have
a
pre-trial
motion.
what
tactical
reason
exists
for
not
making
this
pre-trial
motion?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
he
said
i
would
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
that
is
my
point
mr.
chief
justice.
what
effort
would
be
wasted
when
a
man
is
on
trial
for
his
life
if
you
use
every
available
tactic
perhaps
to
try
to
save
that
person's
life?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
that
the
record
shows
that.
these
are
the
recollections
of
mr.
turow
--
of
mr.
amadi
regarding
what
mr.
turow
may
have
been
thinking.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
testimony
in
the
record
on
page
27
which
i
think
puts
the
thing
in
its
proper
light
is
in
the
middle
of
page
27,
amadi
saying
one
thing,
“i
came
into
the
case
kind
of
late.
i
came
in
as
a
trial
expert
to
help
mr.
turow
to
select
juries
and
what
not.
things
done
previous
thereto
were
mr.
turow’s
business.
i
did
tell
him.
i
thought
he
ought
to
have
a
bill
of
particulars
and
a
prayer
for
oyer
and
he
did
that.”
now,
those
motions
were
filed
the
very
day
before
trial.
what
--
i
do
not
understand
how
mr.
amadi,
he
can
say
it
that
perhaps
turow
considered
it,
but
he
certainly
can
know
it
what
turow
is
considering.
what
we
have
here
is
a
record
that
is
un-rebutted
in
terms
of
amadi
saying
that
turow
did
not
do
anything
until
the
day
before
trial,
it
is
what
i
suggested
that
he
do
because
if
we
look
at
the
record
we
see
that
those
motions
were
filed
the
day
before
trial..
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
a
discovery
kind
of
motion
and
it
sought
the
statements
that
were
made
by
francis.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
directing
yourself
i
think
to
the
question
of
tactics,
of
strategy
and
you
are
saying
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
gained
there.
what
i
am
pointing
to
in
this
record
is
one
cannot
draw
the
conclusion
that
nothing
would
be
gained
by
attacking
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
francis.
this
young
boy
was
on
trial
for
his
life.
the
state
was
seeking
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do
not
think
that
hypothesis
is
so
reasonable
in
this
case,
given
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
this
case
we
have
a
unique
decision
to
charge
made
basically
by
the
district
attorney
and
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
this
was
a
first
time
in
the
recollected
history
of
orleans
parish
that
a
person
had
been
indicted
for
felony
murder
where
the
deceased
was
a
co-perpetrator
of
the
crime.
one
wonders
whether
or
not
a
fairly
constituted
grand
jury
might
have
questioned
the
district
attorney
in
seeking
the
felony
murder
indictment
in
this
case.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
if
there
are
questions.
this
case
is
not
a
case
where
like
in
davis,
one
must
conclude
that
there
is
an
over
abundance
of
evidence
showing
that
the
grand
jury
would
have
done
what
it
did
and
that
the
petit
jury
would
have
convicted.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
think
that
in
most
cases,
people
would
on
reflection
think
that
there
are
things
could
have
been
done
differently,
but
here
we
are
talking
about
the
basic
constitutional
right,
one
establish
for
nearly
a
hundred
years.
and
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
when
i
think
upon
reflection,
should
say
to
you
i
wish
i
would
have
done
that.
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
one
should
consider
especially
and
that
is
what
disturbs
me
in
this
case.
i
do
not
understand
what
tactical
reason
could
exist
for
failing
to
challenge
the
grand
jury.
if
he
had
made
a
plea
with
the
state
where
they
would
not
be
asking
for
the
death
penalty
then
perhaps
i
could
see
that
he
would
have
gained
something.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
can
see
none
and
then
i
turn
to
the
record
and
i
see
that
nothing
is
done
in
this
case
until
the
day
before
trial
at
all.
no
seeking
of
the
statements
that
francis
allegedly
made.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
adds
up
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
protecting
the
constitutional
right
that
francis
is
now
seeking
to
vindicate.
the
difficulty
i
think
with
casting
this
case
in
terms
of
incompetence
is
it
raises
a
specter
of
incompetent
bumbling
lawyers.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
do
not
think
that
this
record
reflects
the
conclusion
that
they
did
make
an
intelligent
strategic
decision
not
to
make
the
challenge.
that
is
why
i
do
not
think
the
court
is
bound
to
conclude
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
could
have
made
it,
but
he
did
not,
but
as
he
says
he
came
in
the
case
only
for
the
purpose
of
being
the
trial
expert
and
whatever
turow
did
before
was
turow’s
business.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
am
not,
but
of
course
a
mistake
could
not
have
been
remedied.
the
motion
to
challenge
--
the
time
for
filing
a
motion
had
long
passed.
it
passed
on
march
4.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
say
from
the
record
that
amadi
was
in
the
case
on
march
4,
1965.
he
said
he
was
in
there
several
months
before
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir,
he
said
that
mr.
turow
and
there
is
great
confusion
in
this
area.
he
said
that
mr.
turow
had
been
in
the
case
for
four
or
five
months
and
then
he
was
appointed
several
months
before
the
trial.
if
that
were
true,
that
would
have
meant
that
turow
would
be
appointed
for
nearly
seven
or
eight
months
prior
to
trial
which
of
course
is
just
not
the
case.
turow
was
appointed
in
february,
the
trial
was
in
june.
mr.
amadi
was
not
clear
in
his
recollection
of
exactly
when
he
came
in
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
i
understand
that,
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
amadi’s
responsibility
was
limited.
now,
if
one
looks
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
one
is
left
with
the
questions
of,
why
was
this
motion
not
filed?
there
is
nothing
clearly
stated
in
the
record
that
shows
it
was
a
tactical
reason.
one
is
left
with
the
other
factors
which
we
say
add
up
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver
by
francis.
there
is
not
deliberate
bypass
by
francis
or
his
counsel,
but
if
the
test
is
not
that
of
fay
versus
noia,
if
the
test
is
one
of
cause
then
we
say
this
record
supports
a
proposition
that
cause
have
been
shown.
