i
think
it
is
in
the
original
appendix
in
this
court.

this
page
is
25
through
27,
i
think
mrs.
rutledge
was
referring
to
the
appendix
in
this
court.
unknown

(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
if
it
was
a
deliberate
bypass,
is
that
addressed
to
(inaudible)
the
lawyers
of
the
accused?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
think
that
henry
v.
mississippi
put
you
on
this?
unknown
speaker
what
about
her
argument
that
the
deliberate
bypass
in
some
instances
might
be
attributed
to
actions
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what
about
henry
versus
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
thinking
about
in
henry
versus
mississippi
although
trial
strategy
adapted
by
counsel
without
prior
consultation
with
an
accused
will
not
where
the
circumstances
are
exceptional
preclude
the
accused
from
asserting
constitutional
claim.
do
you
think
that
the
deliberate
bypassing
by
counselor
in
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
as
a
part
of
trial
strategy
would
have
that
effect
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
does
that
not
suggest
that
maybe
the
deliberate
bypass
where
the
conduct
is
out
of
counsel
rather
than
the
accused?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
contempt
in
his
objection
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
you
have
here
is
a
failure
of
pre-trial
to
make
the
objection
at
the
statute.
the
louisiana
statute
said
it
had
to
be
made
pre-trial
if
it
was
to
be
made
at
all?
unknown
speaker
what
is
this
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
cosby
(ph)
was
a
case
that
i
remembered
from
mississippi
where
the
lawyer
was
an
assigned
white
lawyer
and
the
accused
was
black
and
there
i
gather
that
there
were
some
reasons
to
support
why
a
white
lawyer
did
not
make
kind
of
attack.
but
here
you
got
black
lawyers
with
a
black
accused
and
what
possible
reason
could
there
been
for
they
are
not,
they
had
to
know
about
and
did
know
about
the
statute
which
required
that
the
attack
be
made
pre-trial.
what
possible
justification
could
there
be
for
their
not
doing
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
wonder
though,
their
failure
do
it,
does
that
add
up
to
incompetence?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
amadi
had
made
it
when
he
came
in
the
case?
