justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
mentioned
your
position
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
that
way
as
you
have
already
stated
two
counsels
in
this
case,
you
claim
both
are
ineffective?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
amadi
did
testify
that
he
thought,
although
he
was
not
positive,
that
he
had
discussed
whereby
a
motion
should
be
made
to
suppress
the
grand
jury
indictment
for
the
grounds
you
now
rely
on
and
amadi
had
tried
over
hundred
murder
cases.
how
can
he
be
incompetent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
one
had
to
try
at
least
one
to
be
competent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no
matter
whether
you
try
one
or
a
hundred,
you
still
may
be
incompetent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
suppose
it
is
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
these
particular
lawyers
were
incompetent?
