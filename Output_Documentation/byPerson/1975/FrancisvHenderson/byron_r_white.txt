justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
claim
any
different
from
a
claim
that
you
had
not
had
adequate
assistance
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
had
adequate
assistance
there
would
not
be
a
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
that
is
what
you
just
said
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
explain
your
cause
by
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
else
is
there
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
is
there
here
in
terms
of
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
your
issue
here
really
is
whether
he
had
adequate
assistance
of
counsel?
it
might
as
well
be
put
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
something,
he
failed
to
file
a
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
something?
it
is
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
there
might
be
circumstances
where
you
would
agree
that
any
person
who
did
not
file
such
a
motion
would
be
a
fool?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
point
is
that
there
is
just
a
failure
of
proof
with
this
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
ever
any
question
raised
in
these
proceedings
about
the
petit
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
none
in
the
habeas
proceeding?
