ms.
barbara
rutledge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
louisiana
takes
the
position
that
under
the
ruling
of
davis
versus
united
states
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
waived
his
right
to
attack
the
grand
jury.
first,
petitioner
urges
that
this
court
should
not
apply
the
ruling
of
davis
versus
united
states
to
a
state
prisoner.
the
state
respectfully
submits
that
this
is
the
ruling
that
should
be
applied,
but
there
is
no
reason
or
basis
not
to
apply
this
to
state
as
well
as
federal
prisoners.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
no,
it
was
under
the
rule,
the
federal
rule.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
yes,
that
by
due
process
that
the
state
prisoner
under
the
louisiana
law
waived
his
right
and
that
he
had
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
that
is
right.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
in
the
davis
case,
this
court
stated
that
actual
prejudice
must
be
shown
in
order
to
obtain
relief
from
a
statutorily
provided
waiver
for
failure
to
assert
it
in
a
timely
manner.
however,
even
if
this
court
would
not
conclude
that
actual
prejudice
need
be
shown
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
the
state
respectfully
submits
that
likewise
was
no
showing
of
“cause”
in
this
case.
as
far
as
applying
the
rule
of
davis
versus
united
states,
this
logic
that
applied
there
applies
with
equal
force
to
a
state
prisoner.
this
court
observed
in
davis
versus
united
states
if
time
limits
for
attack
in
the
jury
composition
are
followed,
inquiry
into
alleged
defects
maybe
concluded
and
if
necessary
cured
it
before
the
court,
the
witnesses
and
the
parties
that
have
gone
to
the
burden
and
the
expense
of
a
trial.
if
defendants
were
allowed
to
flaw
its
time
limitations
on
the
other
hand,
there
would
be
little
incentive
to
comply
with
its
terms
when
a
successful
attack
might
simply
result
in
a
new
indictment
prior
to
trial.
strong,
tactical
considerations
would
militate
in
favor
of
delaying
the
raising
the
claim
in
hope
of
acquittal,
with
the
thought
if
those
hopes
did
not
materialize,
the
claim
could
be
used
to
offset
in
otherwise
valid
conviction
at
the
time
when
re-prosecution
might
well
be
difficult.
that
reasoning
applies
in
a
federal
or
a
state
prosecution.
if
this
court
should
accept
petitioner's
position,
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
that
would
have
to
be
an
attempt
to
attack
a
grand
jury
because
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
all
the
defense
counsel
will
have
to
say
is
he
believed
it
would
be
wasted
effort.
in
henry
versus
mississippi,
this
court
shows
that
it
will
look
to
see
if
a
procedural
rule
serves
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
it
is
urged
that
the
rule
to
attack
a
grand
jury
prior
to
trial
serves
interest
of
time
and
expense
of
court
and
witnesses.
this
court
stated
in
kaufman
versus
united
states,
plainly
the
interest
in
finality
is
the
same
with
regard
to
both
federal
and
state
prisoners
and
that
is
what
the
state
is
seeking.
moreover,
this
court
observed
in
kaufman,
federal
prisoners
are
no
less
entitled
to
such
consideration
than
state
prisoners.there
is
no
reason
to
treat
federal
trial
errors
as
less
destructive
of
constitutional
guarantees
than
state
trial
error.
not
to
gave
great
exclusive
effects
to
procedural
defaults
by
federal
defendants
then
to
similar
defaults
of
a
state.
the
state
simply
asks
that
the
converse
be
applied.
in
an
address
to
the
conference
of
chief
justices
in
1964,
mr.
justice
brennan
observed,
if
the
states
afford
the
prisoners,
full
and
fair
opportunity
on
direct
or
collateral
review
to
raise
and
prosecute
their
federal
constitutional
claims
as
federal
habeas
corpus
affords
then
the
federal
habeas
corpus
courts
will
have
no
need
to
intervene
in
the
supervision
of
state
criminal
justice.
the
state
is
asking
that
they
be
afforded
the
same
direct
and
collateral
review
as
a
federal
prisoner,
but
that
no
harsher
rule
be
applied.
except
in
the
contention
that
the
standards
of
davis
versus
united
states
should
be
applied,
we
observe
that
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
actual
prejudice
must
be
shown.
they
found
that
the
louisiana
rule
did
not
make
any
exception
for
a
waiver,
but
they
then
grafted
a
provision
that
there
should
be
a
showing
of
actual
prejudice.
it
is
submitted
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
eminently
correct
and
that
it
is
not
unfair
if
you
would
find
that
this
is
a
harsher
rule
than
davis
to
apply
it
since
the
statute
of
louisiana
was
silent.
however,
in
the
alternative,
if
this
court
finds
that
something
less
was
meant
by
cause,
we
found,
we
urge
that
this
court
find
that
there
has
been
no
showing
of
cause
in
this
case.
it
was
observed
yesterday
that
the
issue
here
basically
is,
was
there
a
showing
of
incompetence
by
counsel
to
justify
a
showing
of
cause
for
the
waiver
of
the
attack
on
the
grand
jury?
i
submit
that
the
record
supports
a
finding
that
there
was
most
competent
and
able
attorney
in
this
case.
petitioner
urges
first
of
all
that
chief
counsel
mr.
turow
was
not
a
capable
attorney
and
that
he
had
not
tried
a
criminal
case,
a
capital
case
in
15
years
and
his
basic
practice
had
turned
away
from
the
criminal
practice.
i
submit
that
this
is
no
showing
of
an
incompetent
attorney.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
i
can
point
to
show
mr.
turow’s
competence
as
an
efficient,
hardworking
attorney,
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
say
there
is
--
ms.
barbara
rutledge
i
do
not
believe
that
a
failure
to
file
a
motion
in
itself
without
something
more
can
be
said
to
be
shown
to
be
cause
to
establish
that
this
was
an
incompetent
attorney.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
it
is
something
and
it
may
be
that
it
shows
that
he
made
a
well
reasoned
conclusion.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
there
could
be
circumstances,
that
is
right,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
is
reflected
in
this
record
at
all.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
there
is
a
failure
of
proof.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
at
this
time,
there
were
being
attacks
made
on
the
grand
jury.
there
were
blacks
on
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
this
petitioner..
there
were
blacks
in
the
petit
jury
venire.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
in
the
lower
courts,
no,
there
has
not
been.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
no,
the
attack
is
on
the
grand
jury
and
there
were
blacks
on
the
jury
venire.
this
court
is
aware
that
there
was
attacks
on
this
grand
jury
proceeding
in
louisiana
and
it
was
found
to
be
validly
constituted
grand
juries
and
writs
of
certiorari
were
denied
by
this
case.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
yes.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
yes.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
in
the
district
court
the
records
were
submitted
upstate
versus
bob
dale,
state
versus
simpson
--
ms.
barbara
rutledge
yes,
yes.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
it
could
well
be
that
save
the
attorneys
have
to
make
that
decision
throughout
the
trial
is
to
--
ms.
barbara
rutledge
yes,
i
think
it
was.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
i
think
it
was.
his
words
were
he
felt
it
would
be
wasted
effort.
i
think
that
can
be
concluded
that
he
did
not
think
perhaps
that
it
would
have
been
a
valid
motion,
a
motion
to
quash
was
filed
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
that
is
right.
there
can
be
an
intelligent
wave
of
motions
and
it
certainly
does
not
reflect
an
incompetence
of
counsel
and
as
i
stated
a
motion
to
quash
was
failed
although
it
was
on
other
grounds.
and
in
this
respect,
i
think
the
fact
that
other
motions
were
filed,
demonstrates
that
these
attorneys
were
actively
participating
and
working
for
the
benefit
of
their
client.
these
were
not
incompetent
counsels.
petitioner
strongly
attacks
the
competence
of
mr.
turow.
he
does
not
quite
strongly
attack
the
competence
of
mr.
amadi
because
he
cannot
say
that
mr.
amadi
was
not
completely
familiar
with
the
criminal
law.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
i
think
that
is
what
counsel
would
lead
you
to
believe,
but
if
you
read
the
testimony
or
the
transcript
of
the
hearing,
they
asked
mr.
amadi,
mr.
amadi
approximately
how
long
was
it
before
–-
ms.
barbara
rutledge
i
am
reading
from
the
supplemental
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeal,
page
54.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
i
think
it
is
a
part
of
this
record.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
no,
i
do
not.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
and
they
asked
“mr.
amadi
approximately
how
long
was
it
before
the
time
of
trial
that
you
were
incorporated
with
co-counsel
mr.
turow?”
“two
or
three
months
i
am
not
positive.”
“two
or
three
months
i
am
saying
i
am
not
positive."
ms.
barbara
rutledge
also,
in
the
transcript,
he
said
he
considered
mr.
turow
was
petitioner’s
chief
counsel.
however,
he
also
said,
i
was
francis’
lawyer.
there
was
no
denial
of
that
fact.
he
was
asked,
were
you
a
co-counsel?
yes,
all
the
decisions
were
joint
decisions.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
yes,
you
are
correct
and
i
think
the
reason
that
you
might
say
mr.
turow
is
considered
the
chief
counsel
is
because
the
state
--
district
judge
designated
only
one
counsel
should
do
the
cross
examination
and
the
presentation
of
the
defense’s
case.
but
i
think
the
testimony
of
mr.
amadi
shows
that
they
were
joint
counsels.
he
said,
“all
decisions
were
jointly
made.”
also
yesterday
petitioner
urged
that
there
was
showing
of
incompetence
because
the
motion
to
suppress
was
denied
and
there
was
no
bail
reserved.
if
you
read
the
transcript,
mr.
amadi
said,
there
is
no
transcript
of
the
trial
of
the
case,
but
to
the
best
of
his
recollection,
he
did
file
a
bill
of
exceptions
which
was
his
general
procedure.
also
it
points
out
that
the
state
in
this
case
was
seeking
nothing
less
than
a
death
sentence.
the
defendant
received
life.
so,
his
counsels
fought
actively
against
the
state
for
the
death
penalty
and
were
effective
in
that
respect.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
that
is
correct.
also
counsel
pointed
out
yesterday
as
an
example
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
that
they
took
no
appeal
and
he
made
the
statement
that
that
is
because
they
were
court-appointed
counsel
and
they
did
not
want
to
be
hung
with
the
case
for
a
lengthy
time.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
that
is
correct.
it
was
not
simply
because
they
did
not
want
to
be
burdened
with
this
case.
when
you
read
the
transcript,
it
shows
that
they
made
a
decision.
they
talked
to
the
defendant.
they
talked
to
his
family.
they
urged
him
not
to
appeal
not
just
because
they
did
not
want
to
carry
the
case
because
he
had
an
armed
robbery
charge
pending
over
him
which
they
thought
they
could
compromise,
if
he
did
not
appeal
by
having
it
not
prosecuted.
they
also
point
out
in
the
transcript,
when
we
heard
the
facts
throughout
the
trial
and
as
it
appears
to
us
we
would
be
wasting
our
time
as
lawyers.
this
was
not
just
to
be
relieved
as
the
burden
of
representing
this
man.
i
do
not
think
that
has
been
a
showing
in
this
record
of
incompetence
and
petitioner
strongly
urges
that
is
his
ground
for
cause.
finally,
if
it
should
be
concluded
that
something
more
than
cause
has
to
be
shown,
if
the
ruling
of
fay
versus
noia
must
apply
in
this
case,
i
think
it
might
be
said
that
there
was
a
deliberate
bypass
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
that
is
correct;
i
admit
it
was
not
by
the
accused,
but
i
think
it
is
--
ms.
barbara
rutledge
of
the
accused,
but
i
think
a
distinction
might
be
made
because
i
think
an
accused
should
be
consulted
when
it
is
a
matter
of
waiver
of
appeal
or
perhaps
he
can
understandingly
confer
with
counsel
when
it
is
maybe
a
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
in
entering
a
guilty
plea,
but
there
are
certain
circumstances
where
i
believe
that
the
waiver
of
the
attorney
must
constitute
the
waiver
of
a
client.
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
16-year-old
defendant
making
an
intelligent
waiver
of
a
motion
to
quash.
ms.
barbara
rutledge
well,
it
does
not
come
out
as
completely
as
that,
but
i
think
it
is
a
logical
step
from
there
that
there
are
certain
points
where
a
client
could
not
talk
with
his
attorney
and
make
an
intelligent
decision
whether
he
should
waive
a
certain
motion
or
not.
if
it
would
be
that
status,
he
probably
would
not
need
an
attorney.
so
i
would
submit,
even
if
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
that
you
have
to
apply
a
deliberate
bypass,
even
that
was
done
in
this
case.
so
it
is
the
state's
position
here
that
under
the
rule
of
comity,
applying
davis
versus
united
states
to
bring
a
case
to
finality,
unless
there
is
an
exceptional
showing
by
petitioner,
there
must
be
held
that
he
has
waived
his
right
to
attack
a
grand
jury
and
that
there
has
not
been
that
showing
in
the
case
involved.
