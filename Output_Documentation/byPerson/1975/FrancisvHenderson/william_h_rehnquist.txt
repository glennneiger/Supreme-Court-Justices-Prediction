he
did
not
testify.
he
was
ill
at
the
time.
he
did
testify,
did
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
must
say
mr.
rogow,
i
share
with
justice
marshallâ€™s
question
as
to
your
comments,
no
doubt
based
about
mr.
turow,
i
remember
when
i
was
a
law
clerk
here,
seeing
his
name
on
briefs
in
this
court,
that
is
you
know
20
odd
years
ago?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
that
is
not
fair
thing,
but
what
do
you
have
when
you
come
down
to
it
by
hypothesis
in
any
case
like
this,
you
are
always
going
to
have
the
case
where
the
lawyer
failed
to
make
a
timely
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
venire
otherwise
you
would
not
be
here
and
if
that
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
than
the
cause
requirement
means
nothing.
you
got
to
show
something
more
than
the
fact
that
he
did
not
do
what
he
is
not
claiming
he
is
relieved
from
doing
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
there
is
certain
types
of
motions
in
criminal
cases
that
an
experienced
criminal
lawyer
might
feel
you
have
had
a
good
chance
of
winning,
but
that
might
not
materially
advance
his
client's
cause
other
than
to
delay
the
prosecution
a
little
bit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
right
in
thinking
there
was
this
six-year
delay
between
the
time
of
the
trial
in
orleans
parish
and
the
state
habeas
proceeding
from
which
most
of
his
testimony
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rogow
in
my
days
of
practice
in
arizona
and
the
federal
courts,
there
was
a
proceeding
whereby
someone
who
had
committed
a
crime
in
another
state
could
be
tried
in
arizona
upon
waiver
of
indictment
because
the
grand
jury
could
not
indict
because
the
witnesses
--
whereas
they
would
bring
the
witnesses
in
for
the
trial
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
probably
is
still
obtained.
and
i
do
not
think
any
of
the
members
of
our
bar
felt
that
they
were
giving
up
any
substantial
right
of
a
defendant
to
waive
indictment
in
that
situation.
he
was
going
to
get
his
trial
and
they
figured
that
the
grand
jury
was
probably
going
to
indict
him,
it
would
take
time,
but
that
would
be
all
they
would
gain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
got
to
conclude
that
if
they
had
successfully
attack
the
grand
jury,
that
not
only
that
something
would
have
been
gained,
but
that
no
reasonable
lawyer
could
have
concluded
otherwise
and
is
it
not
a
perfectly
reasonable
hypothesis
that
if
they
successfully
attack
this
grand
jury,
some
other
grand
jury
is
going
to
return
exactly
the
same
indictment?
