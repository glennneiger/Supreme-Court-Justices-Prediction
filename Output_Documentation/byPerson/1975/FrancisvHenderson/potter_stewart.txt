justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
a
colloquy
beginning
on
page
11
of
the
petitionerâ€™s
brief
and
one
can
assume
that
perhaps
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
case
is
before
us
by
way
of
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
three
years
ago
in
the
case
called
davis
against
the
united
states
reported
in
volume
411
of
the
united
states
reports,
the
court
held
that
a
federal
prisoner
who
would
fail
to
make
a
timely
challenge
to
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
composition
of
the
grand
jury
that
had
indicted
him,
could
not
after
his
conviction
attack
the
grand
jury's
composition
in
an
action
for
federal
collateral
relief.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
prisoner
who
failed
to
make
a
timely
challenge
to
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him
could
after
his
conviction
bring
that
challenge
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
the
petitioner
abraham
francis
was
brought
to
trial
in
louisiana
court
in
1965
upon
an
indictment
for
felony
murder.
he
was
represented
by
counsel
provided
by
the
state.
the
louisiana
law
then
in
force
clearly
required
that
any
objection
by
a
defendant
to
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
that
had
indicted
him
had
to
be
made
in
advance
of
his
trial.
otherwise,
the
law
provided,
"all
such
objections
shall
be
considered
as
waived
and
shall
not
afterwards
be
urged
or
heard."
no
such
objection
in
any
form
was
made
by
or
on
behalf
of
francis.
at
the
ensuing
trial
the
jury
found
francis
guilty,
and
he
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
he
did
not
appeal
the
conviction,
but
later
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
the
district
court
granted
the
writ
on
the
ground
that
negroes
had
been
impermissibly
excluded
from
the
grand
jury
that
had
returned
the
indictment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment,
holding
that
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
davis
case,
"the
louisiana
waiver
provision
must
be
given
effect
by
the
federal
district
court
unless
there
is
a
showing
of
actual
prejudice."
we
granted
certiorari
in
order
to
consider
a
recurring
and
unresolved
question
of
federal
law.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court,
we
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
rule
of
davis
against
the
united
states
applies
with
equal
force
when
a
federal
court
is
asked
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
to
overturn
a
state
court
conviction
because
of
an
allegedly
unconstitutional
grand
jury
indictment.
in
a
collateral
attack
upon
a
conviction
that
rule
requires,
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
assertion,
not
only
a
showing
of
"cause"
for
the
defendant's
failure
to
challenge
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
before
trial,
but
also
a
showing
of
actual
prejudice.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
its
consideration
or
decision.
