justice

stewart
or
even
private
housing?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
what
does
that
mean
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
to
refuse
because
he
thought
that
mr.
gallo
had
made
this
request
as
a
favor.
i
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
still
part
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
complaints
examiner’s
report,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all,
there
seems
to
be
no
issue
in
this
case.
you
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken
as
to
the
retroactive
application
of
717
(c)
to
a
situation
where
a
complaint
rose
before
the
enactment
of
the
1973?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
issue
there.
justice
potter
stewart
but
apparently
it
was
litigated
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
somewhere
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
misapprehend
the
structure
of
your
argument
when
i
state
my
understanding
that
your
part
two
of
your
brief,
all
of
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
need
to
exhaust
becomes
relevant
only
if
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
was
wrong.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
if
717
is
exclusive,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
exclusive
and
by
itself
would
be
dispositive?
justice
potter
stewart
and
part
two,
your
whole
exhaustion
argument
is
premised
upon
the
arguendo
hypothesis
that
remedies
other
than
717
(c)
are
available?
justice
potter
stewart
premised
upon
the
hypothesis
that
other
remedies
are
available?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
those
statistics
simply
might
indicate
that
the
government,
as
an
employer,
is
more
aware
of
the
requirements
of
non-discrimination
in
employment
than
many
employers
in
the
private
sector?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
of
course,
your
client
did
make
an
administrative
complaint
to
his
agency
and
a
hearing
before
a
certified
complaints
examiner
and
is
it
your
position
that
not
even
that
much
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
required?
that,
instead
of
doing
that,
he
could
have
gone
directly
into
the
federal
district
court,
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
without
further
exhaustion.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
talking
about.
your
position
is
he
need
not
even
make
an
original
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
of
these
cases
that
is
brown
petitioner
against
the
general
services
administration
and
other
is
number
74-768
comes
to
us
by
way
of
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
principal
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
section
section
717
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
as
amended,
provides
the
exclusive
judicial
remedy
for
claims
of
discrimination
in
federal
employment.
the
petitioner,
clarence
brown,
is
a
negro
who
has
been
employed
by
the
general
services
administration
since
1957.
at
the
time
this
litigation
began
he
was
classified
in
grade
gs-7.
in
december
of
1970
brown
was
referred
along
with
two
white
colleagues
for
promotion
to
grade
gs
-9.
all
three
were
rated
highly
qualified
and
the
promotion
was
given
to
one
of
the
white
candidate
for
the
position.
brown
filed
a
complaint
with
the
gsa
equal
employment
opportunity
office
alleging
that
racial
discrimination
had
biased
the
selection
process.
that
complaint
was
withdrawn
when
brown
was
told
that
other
gs-9
positions
would
soon
be
available.
another
gs-9
position
did
become
vacant
in
june
of
1971,
for
which
the
brown
along
with
two
others
was
recommended
as
"highly
qualified."
again,
a
white
applicant
was
chosen.
brown
filed
a
second
administrative
complaint
with
the
gsa
equal
employment
opportunity
office.
and
after
several
administrative
steps,
the
gsa
rendered
its
final
decision
in
march
of
1972.
the
agency's
director
of
civil
rights
informed
brown
by
letter
by
of
his
conclusion
that
considerations
of
race
had
not
entered
the
promotional
process.
the
director's
letter
told
brown
that,
if
he
chose,
he
might
carry
the
administrative
process
further
by
lodging
an
appeal
with
the
board
of
appeals
and
review
of
the
civil
service
commission,
and
that,
alternatively,
he
could
file
suit
within
30
days
in
a
federal
district
court.
42
days
later,
brown
did
filed
a
suit
in
a
federal
district
court.
his
complaint
alleged
jurisdiction
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
with
particular
reference
to
section
717,
and
also
under
two
or
three
other
jurisdictional
claims
one
being
title
28,
united
states
code
1331,
the
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
another
the
declaratory
judgment
act
adds
to
another
title
42
of
the
united
states
code
section
1981
arriving
from
the
civil
rights
legislation
of
more
than
a
century
ago.
the
respondents,
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
brown
had
not
filed
his
complaint
within
30
days
of
final
agency
action
as
required
by
section
717(c)
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
the
district
court
granted
the
defendants
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
judgment
of
dismissal.
it
held,
first,
that
the
section
717
remedy
for
federal
employment
discrimination
was
retroactively
available
to
any
employee,
such
as
the
petitioner,
whose
administrative
complaint
was
pending
at
the
time
section
717
became
effective
on
march
24
of
1972,
and
the
respondents
do
not
question
that
ruling.
the
appellate
court
held,
second,
that
section
717
does
provides
the
exclusive
judicial
remedy
for
federal
employment
discrimination,
and
that
the
complaint
had
not
been
timely
filed
under
that
statute.
finally,
the
court
ruled
that,
even
if
717
did
not
preempt
other
remedies,
then
the
petitioner's
complaint
was
still
properly
dismissed
because
of
his
failure
to
exhaust
available
administrative
remedies.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
important
issues
of
federal
law
presented
by
this
case.
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
the
courts
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
that
section
717
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
amended
in
1972
provides
the
exclusive
judicial
remedy
for
claims
and
discrimination
in
federal
employment.
since
brown
failed
to
file
a
timely
complaint
under
section
717(c),
the
district
court
properly
dismissed
the
case.
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
affirmed
that
judgment
of
dismissal.
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
today
affirmed.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
he
has
been
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
