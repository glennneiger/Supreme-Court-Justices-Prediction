mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
delineated
several
possible
rules
that
the
court
might
adapt
with
regard
to
the
question
of
exhaustion
in
section
1981
cases
brought
by
federal
employees.
we
believe
that
the
court
should
adapt
among
these
the
same
rule
that
was
adapted
by
this
court
last
term
in
johnson
against
the
railway
express
agency.
as
you
recall
in
johnson,
the
issue
was
whether
an
employee
of
the
rea
who
wanted
to
sue
under
section
1981
should
or
indeed
could,
postpone
that
section
1981
action
until
he
had
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
created
by
title
vii.
this
court
held
unanimously
that
such
an
employee
need
not
exhaust
those
remedies
and,
indeed,
under
certain
circumstances
could
not
postpone
this
1981
action
while
he
did
so.
we
believe
the
same
rule
should
be
applied
to
federal
employees
and
we
ground
that
contention
on
a
variety
of
considerations.
first,
as
this
court
noted
in
morton
against
mancari,
congress
in
1972
concluded
that
the
administrative
procedure
which
is
involved
here
was
ineffective
for
the
most
part
and
had
served
to
impede
rather
than
advance
the
congressional
and
national
policy
of
eliminating
discrimination
in
employment.
that
congressional
determination,
of
course,
was
based
on
extensive
hearings
and
a
broad
factual
inquiry.
in
1975,
the
commission
on
civil
rights
conducted
a
similar
extensive
inquiry
and
also
reached
the
same
conclusion,
namely,
that
the
administrative
procedures
involved
had
not
changed
since
congress’
first
investigation
and
that
they
continue
to
fail
to
afford
to
federal
employees
a
meaningful
and
fair
opportunity
for
vindication
of
their
claims
of
employment
discrimination.
we
believe
that
these
findings
should
be
accepted
by
the
court
and
that
they
undercut
completely
any
basis
for
exhaustion
rule
under
these
circumstances.
we
believe
that
the
policy
of
exhaustion
fundamentally
rests
on
there
being
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
pursuit
of
the
procedure
involved
will
in
fact
yield
the
relief
that
the
employee
wants,
and
therefore,
obviate
the
need
for
judicial
intervention.
there
simply
is
no
realistic
possibility
that
that
will
occur
in
the
administrative
process.
and
in
that
regard,
this
case
of
course
presents
a
somewhat
unique
situation
because
normally
we
do
not
have
these
kinds
of
findings
by
the
congress
or
the
civil
rights
commission
as
to
the
defects
in
the
procedure
and
because
of
those
findings,
we
think
that
any
presumption
that
the
process
--
cases
simply
cannot
be
indulged
in.
second,
even
without
regard
to
those
findings,
any
federal
employee
who
sued
prior
to
proceeding
all
the
way
through
the
administrative
process
would
be
entitled
to
claim
that,
in
fact,
it
would
have
been
futile
for
him
to
do
so
or
to
go
further
than
he
did.
and
in
view
of
the
congressional
and
commission
findings,
that
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
on
it.
and
so,
we
find
that
the
courts
in
any
one
of
these
cases
was
involved
in
a
complex
and
time-consuming
factual
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
further
proceedings
would
have
been
warranted.
for
example,
in
this
case,
it
might
be
possible
to
have
a
trial
as
to
whether
or
not
going
to
the
appeals
review
board
would
be
efficacious.
we
think,
for
the
reasons
set
out
by
the
court
in
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
that
it
makes
more
sense
for
the
court
simply
o
proceed
and
devote
their
time
directly
to
a
trial
on
the
merits
than
to
what,
in
many
cases,
would
be
a
much
more
cumbersome
and
time-consuming
proceeding
as
to
whether
or
not
the
administrative
process
involved
was
in
fact
and
under
the
circumstances
likely
be
efficacious.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
with
regard
to
my
second
contention,
we
think
the
employee
would
be
entitled
to
make
that
specific
showing
and
the
resulting
trial
would
be
more
cumbersome
than
a
trial
on
the
merits.
but
i
think
with
regard
to
the
presumption,
it
is
true
in
a
sense
that
a
presumption
is
the
only
way
you
are
ever
going
to
find
that
this
process
is
effective
because
if
you
look
at
the
process
where
there
are
findings
of
congress
and
the
civil
rights
commission,
you
will
have
to
conclude
otherwise.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
they
are
not
binding,
the
conclusions.
the
conclusions
of
congress
are
entitled
some
substantial
weight.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
i
think
what
the
government
invites
the
court
to
do
is
to
fashion
a
rule
with
regard
to
exhaustion
that
it
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
administrative
process
is
efficacious
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
congress
and
the
civil
rights
commission
have
found
that
they
are
not,
and
you
cannot
blink
that
reality.
any
request
for
an
exhaustion
rule
ultimately
puts
that
in
issue
and
normally
it
would
be
resolved
in
a
case
by
case
basis.
but
we
think,
in
view
of
those
findings
and
of
the
general
policy
in
this
area
of
independent
overlapping
remedies,
that
it
would
make
more
sense
to
just
have
the
simple
and
straightforward
and
more
administrative
rule
that
exhaustion
need
not
be
required.
it
would
be
possible
to
follow
the
procedure
you
suggest,
but
then
in
this
case,
for
example,
we
would
have
to
have
a
trial
about
the
appeals
review
board
and
would
have
to
conduct
an
investigation
about
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
normally,
this
court
does
in
fact
inquire
whether
under
the
specific
circumstances
of
the
case
it
would
have
been
probably
efficacious
to
go
forward.
now,
that
may
or
may
not
require
a
trial.
it
may
be
apparent
on
the
undisputed
facts
that
it
would
or
would
have
not
have
been,
but
in
the
case
of
the
administrative
procedure
there
are
a
variety
of
defects,
some
which
are
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
regulation,
some
of
which
are
more
complicated.
for
example,
we
have
noted
there
are
problems
of
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
personnel
who
administer
the
procedure,
that
substantive
title
vii
law
is
not
in
fact
followed
by
these
decisions,
that
the
people
who
administer
the
procedure
are
not
familiar
with
title
vii
law
and
have
no
expertise
in
the
area.
now,
you
could
not,
in
a
particular
case,
require
exhaustion
in
the
assumption
that
all
of
that
was
not
true
and
while,
perhaps
in
most
cases,
those
claims
which
seem
sufficiently
extraordinary
is
not
to
want
a
plenary
judicial
inquiry.
in
this
case,
of
course,
those
contentions
are
the
same
contentions
advanced
and
sustained
by
the
congress
of
united
states
and
civil
rights
commission.
i
think
the
least
would
be
entitled
to
a
trial.
but,
the
same
problem
existed
in
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
with
regard
to
whether
there
should
be
deference
to
the
decision
of
an
arbitrator.
and,
the
court
included
that
while
it
might
be
appropriate
in
some
cases
and
not
others,
it
was
administratively
simpler
just
to
go
ahead
and
have
the
case
tried,
and
that
is
what
we
think
should
occur
here.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
believe
that
it
is.
finally,
with
regard
to
exhaustion,
we
think
that
the
general
policy
of
independent
overlapping
remedies
which
was
acknowledged
and
stressed
in
this
court’s
decision
in
johnson
should
be
applied
here.
in
johnson,
of
course,
the
court
noted
that
the
administrative
procedure
involved
had
to
set
up
under
title
vii,
and
the
title
vii
had
not
required
that
that
procedure
be
followed
by
private
employees
suing
under
1981.
we
think
that
the
same
rule
should
be
applied
here.
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
clear
and
unequivocal
congressional
intent
behind
title
vii
was
to
give
federal
employees
the
same
judicial
remedies
that
are
already
enjoyed
by
private
employees.
this
court
in
boeing
against
sharpe
(ph),
of
course,
suggested
that
it
would
be
unthinkable
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
that
the
rules
in
the
area
of
discrimination
applying
to
the
federal
government
should
be
any
less
stringent
than
the
rules
applying
to
state
and
local
governments.
we
think
the
same
thing
is
true
with
regard
to
judicial
remedies.
if
mr.
brown
had
worked
for
the
railway
express
agency,
if
he
had
worked
for
the
state
of
illinois,
or
if
he
had
worked
for
the
city
of
richmond,
there
is
no
question
that
he
would
be
able
to
maintain
the
suit
and
we
think
he
should
enjoy
no
less
efficacious
judicial
remedies
merely
because
he
worked
for
the
united
states.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
number
of
things
raised
by
the
government
in
this
case,
and
i
turn
first
to
the
question
of
whether
title
vii
repeal
these
other
statutes.
the
government
suggests
that
the
usual
rule
against
repeals
by
implication
applies
only
when
the
substantive
rules
involved
are
different
and
not
when
they
are
supplementary
or
complimentary
remedies.
that
is
just
not
the
law.
at
least
since
wood
versus
the
united
states
in
1848,
the
law
has
been
exactly
to
the
contrary
and
we
set
out
in
our
reply
brief
a
number
of
cases
involving
supplementary
remedies
applying
this
rule
against
a
repeal
by
implication.
the
government
distinguishes
jones
against
mayer
by
noting
that
at
the
time
of
jones,
congress
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
might
be
another
remedy
available.
but
when
title
vii
was
adapted
in
1964,
as
we
have
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
there
were
numerous
statements
in
the
floor
of
the
house
and
the
senate
to
the
effect
that
congress
thought
there
were
no
other
remedies.
the
legislative
history
in
which
congress
indicated
they
thought
there
were
additional
judicial
remedies
is
from
1972,
but
of
course,
the
statute
involved
was
adapted
in
1964
and
not
in
1972.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
do
not
believe
there
was.
moreover,
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park,
the
government
maintained,
and
we
think
correctly,
that
it
really
does
not
matter
whether
the
government
thought
there
was
an
independent
remedy
available
or
not.
with
regard
to
gnotta,
we,
i
must
confess
do
think
it
was
not
correctly
decided,
but
as
indeed,
i
think,
certainly,
the
civil
service
commission
was
of
that
opinion
when
it
advised
congress
on
this
matter
several
years
ago
and
i
do
understand
the
solicitor
general
in
opposing
certain
audit
to
have
also
taken
that
position.
mr.
eric
schnapper
gnotta
versus
the
united
states.
it
is
the
decision
by
justice
blackmun
when
he
was
on
another
court,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
not
expressly
stressed
that
in
that
case
which
was
a
suit
based
on
discrimination
on
the
grounds
of
natural
origin,
there
was
no
provision
applicable
to
that
plaintiff
comparable
to
section
1982.
well,
there
is
such
a
statute
here
and
it
is
1981.
with
regard
to
the
problem
of
exhaustion,
i
think
i
should
state
in
clear
terms
what
the
difference
is
between
the
government’s
perception
of
this
administrative
procedure
and
ours.
we
believe
that
it
is
an
extremely
complex
procedure,
controlled
as
in
glover
by
the
defendants
out
of
which,
at
the
end,
there
was
no
relief
granted
in
fact.
the
government
has
indicated
in
these
papers
and
we
have
noted
similar
statistics
that
out
of
approximately
26,000
complaints
of
employment
discrimination
against
the
federal
government
that
were
initiated
with
eeo
counselors,
backpay
was
awarded
to
approximately
50
people
in
the
entire
year.
that
compares
quiet
dramatically
with
the
statistics
for
the
eeoc
conciliation
procedure
which
over
the
same
period
of
time,
had
twice
as
many
complaints,
but
got
backpay
for
49,388
people
and
suggests,
as
the
government
does,
that
exhaustion
should
be
required
here
because
the
federal
procedure
is
better
than
the
eeoc.
we
suggest
that
it
is,
at
the
least,
not
supported
by
the
results
of
the
system.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
that
is
possible
but,
of
course,
congress
thought
just
the
contrary
when
it
adapted
title
vii.
the
legislative
hearings
and
committee
reports
are
replete
with
conclusions
that
in
fact
the
problems
of
employment
discrimination
in
the
federal
government
were
very
serious.
the
government
suggested
that
all
the
relief
that
is
sought
in
this
case
could
have
been
gotten
in
the
administrative
process.
now,
without
laying
aside
for
a
moment
our
contention
that
even
what
is
technically
available
in
the
administrative
process
is
never
in
fact
given.
there
are
variety
of
things
that
simply
are
not
available.
there
is
a
30-day
statute
of
limitations
for
awards
of
backpay
in
the
administrative
process
and
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
statute
of
limitations
in
federal
court.
the
government
has
what
is
known
--
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
the
way
this
system
works
is
that
you
have
to
--
if
the
kind
of
discrimination
which
you
are
complaining
exists
over
a
period
of
time,
the
government
will
only
run
back
to
30days
before
the
complaint
was
filed.
this
particular
plaintiff
complains
that
that
he
has
been
discriminated
against
a
promotion
as
a
result
of
an
ongoing
practice
that
goes
back
for
several
years.
he
simply
could
not
get
relief
from
most
of
that
on
the
administrative
procedure.
it
is
not
allowed.
second,
the
government
has
what
is
known
in
the
practice
as
a
“but
for”
rule
which
provides
that
once
discrimination
is
shown,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
employee
to
show
that
the
practice
of
discrimination
was
in
fact
the
cause
of
his
non-promotion.
now,
the
rule
in
title
vii
law
and
the
courts
is
exactly
the
opposite
and
the
difference
is
of
some
substantial
importance
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
in
which
the
federal
government
finds
there
has
been
discrimination
it
does
not
award
backpay
to
anyway.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
our
position.
we
have
laid
out
a
variety
of
rules
and,
of
course,
there
are
some
rules
pursuant
to
which
that
would
have
been
required.
but
we
think,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
further
exhaustion
just
makes
no
sense.
mr.
eric
schnapper
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
our
preferred
position,
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
possible
rules,
under
all
of
which
we
would
win
which
would
encompass
at
least
that
much.
