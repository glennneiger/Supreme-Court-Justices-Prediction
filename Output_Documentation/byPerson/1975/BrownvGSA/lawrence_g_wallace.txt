mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
next
case
to
be
argued,
chandler
against
roudebush,
will
to
a
large
extent,
determine
the
future
efficacy
of
the
administrative
process
which
has
been
established
pursuant
to
statute
as
a
remedy
for
claims
of
employment
discrimination
within
the
federal
civil
service
and
the
respective
role
of
the
courts
and
the
administrative
process
in
determining
the
merits
of
the
thousands
of
claims
that
are
filed
each
year.
both
cases
involve
promotion
situations
in
which,
in
accordance
with
the
normal
civil
service
practice,
the
applicants
were
screened
for
qualifications
by
those
responsible
for
personnel
management
and
both
the
complainant
and
the
person
selected
were
rated
as
highly
qualified
in
each
case
for
the
particular
vacancy
for
which
the
promotion
was
to
occur
and
then
the
decision
as
to
which
of
the
highly
qualified
individual
should
be
promoted
was
made
by
the
supervisor
with
the
program
responsibility.
in
chandler,
the
complainant
differed
from
the
person
selected
in
sex
and
race,
and
claimed
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
and
race.
in
brown,
the
complainant
differed
from
the
person
selected
in
race
and
claimed
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
now,
looking
at
the
brown
complaint,
more
specifically
to
see
what
was
at
issue,
the
brown
complaint
was
carried
administratively
through
the
hearing
process
as
well
as
the
informal
counseling
processes
that
proceeded
and
through
the
agency
decision
based
on
the
recommendation
of
the
complaints
examiner.
that
recommendation
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
this
case
and
turning
to
page
37a
in
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
the
examiner
first
noted,
and
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
appointing
authority
acted,
that
both
mr.
robert
owen
bee
(ph),
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
37a,
who
was
selected
and
the
complaint
mr.
brown
were
rated
as
highly
qualified
for
the
position.
under
the
circumstances,
the
relative
experience,
education,
and
background
of
both
mr.
owen
bee
and
mr.
brown
are
irrelevant
to
the
issues
in
as
much
as
the
rating
of
highly
qualified
place
these
two
individuals
in
the
same
area
of
competition
for
the
position.
now,
that
is
irrelevant
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
there
was
discrimination.
there
may
have
been
reliance
by
the
appointing
authority
on
these
differences,
but
the
inquiry
was
into
what
did
the
appointing
authority
rely
on
and
this
is
spelled
out
in
some
detail
on
the
next
four
pages
of
the
appendix.
for
one
thing,
there
was
testimony,
on
page
38a
just
above
the
middle,
from
the
candidates’
supervisors
who
unanimously
recommended
mr.
owen
bee
over
mr.
brown
and
termed
mr.
brown
uncooperative.
an
example
is
noted
of
an
instance
in
which
mr.
brown
had
been
requested
by
one
of
his
supervisors
to
perform
a
management
survey
of
the
federal
telecommunication's
record
center,
but
had
refused
because
he
thought
the
request
had
been
made
as
a
favor
rather.
well,
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
supervisor
acted.
what
i
am
trying
to
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
brown’s
testimony
was
that
the
reason
he
had
not
been
on
the
assignment
was
that
he
thought
it
was
not
a
work
assignment,
but
just
a
favor
that
had
been
requested
of
him
in
the
course
of
mr.
gallo’s
carrying
out
of
his
own
responsibilities.
then
going
on,
the
evidence
was
that
the
recommendations
were
based
on
contacts
with
both
men
on
a
day-to-day
basis
over
a
period
of
years
noting
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
notation
here
that
mr.
brown
did
not
seek
to
cross-examine
these
witnesses.
they
could
have
been
brought
into
the
hearing
if
he
had
done
so.
that
is
noted
on
page
40a,
at
the
top
of
the
first
full
paragraph
on
page
40a
of
the
appendix.
yes?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
part
of
the
complaints
examiner’s
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
there
--
towards
the
bottom
of
38a,
the
evaluation
that
mr.
owen
bee
had
always
displayed
complete
cooperation
and
willingness
to
accept
the
responsibility,
whereas,
mr.
brown
on
occasion
would
offer
some
excuse
or
refuse
assignments.
their
references
to
the
difference
in
the
work
attitudes
of
the
two
of
them
on
page
39a,
including
complaints
received
from
a
member
of
the
data
processing
unit,
with
whom
brown’s
unit
had
to
work,
about
lack
of
cooperativeness
on
brown’s
part
and
that
is
again
developed
in
some
detail
on
page
41a.
now,
when
mr.
brown
went
to
court,
the
recourse
that
was
available
to
him
if
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
administrative
decision
based
on
this
record
was
an
appeal
to
the
civil
service
board,
the
appellate
board,
which
passes
on
these
matters.
and
turning
back
to
mr.
brown’s
complaint,
which
is
on
page,
i
am
looking
at
pages
4a
and
5a
of
the
appendix
at
the
very
bottom,
the
complaint
itself
specifies
when
he
went
and
made
a
resort
to
court.
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
has
been
joined
as
a
party
defendant
because
in
entertaining
and
ruling
upon
the
plaintiff’s
complaint
of
racial
discrimination,
it
acted
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
manner
by
failing
to
make
the
in-depth
inquiry
into
the
alleged
racial
discrimination
as
it
was
to
do
under
the
act.
now,
the
fact
is,
this
complaint
was
filed.
it
happened
that
he
neglected
to
name
all
the
parties
that
he
meant
to
name,
including
the
civil
service
commission
which
became
the
subject
of
further
motions
proceedings,
but
the
fact
is
this
complaint
was
filed
before
the
appeals
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission
was
given
any
opportunity
to
review
the
decision
of
the
agency
which
was
made
on
the
basis
of
that
examination
of
the
complaint
and
a
hearing
conducted
on
behalf
of
the
agency
by
civil
service
commission
trained
examiner.
the
civil
service
commission
itself
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
act
on
this
compliant.
now,
we
are
told
that
once
the
facts
are
known
in
a
case
like
this,
it
is
just
a
legal
matter
as
to
which
the
civil
service
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
here--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
was
informed
at
every
step
of
the
procedure
or
had
the
opportunity
to
be
informed
that
exactly
what
he
could
do
at
the
next
step.
the
record
here
shows
that
page
43a
and
44a
that
after
the
agency
decision
was
made,
he
was
specifically
advised
by
letter
and
it
was
certified
mail
and
his
receipt
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
following
this
latter,
that
he
had
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
board
of
review
at
the
bottom
of
43a
and
this
appeal
must
be
filed
within
15
calendar
days
of
receipt
of
this
letter
and
at
the
top
of
44a.
but,
if
you
choose
to
appeal,
you
retain
the
right
to
file
a
civil
action
in
federal
court
within
30
days
after
receipt
of
the
board’s
final
decision.
if
you
do
not
choose
to
appeal,
you
also
have
the
right
to
file
a
civil
action
within
30
days
of
receipt
of
this
letter
or
180
days
after
filing
an
appeal
with
the
board
of
appeals
and
review
if
no
decision
has
been
made.
it
is
true
that
the
regulations
are
complex,
but
a
complainant
is
not
left
to
fend
for
himself
in
the
regulations.
he
has
counseling
within
the
agency.
he
can
get
further
help
from
the
equal
employment
officer
of
his
agency,
and
he
is
informed
specifically
of
his
procedural
rights
at
each
step.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
nothing
is
shown
in
the
record.
footnote
3
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
indicated
that
he
determined
that
he
would
sue
and
talked
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
who
advised
him
to
get
counsel
and
that
his
suit
was
not
filed
within
30
days
because
three
attorneys
and
several
civil
rights
organizations
turned
his
claim
down
and
he
had
trouble
getting
a
lawyer.
well,
his
claim
on
the
merits
is
unimpressive
and
this
is
maybe
one
reflection
of
that.
the
record
does
not
show
why
he
had
difficulty
getting
a
lawyer.
the
fact
is
he
did
not
file
his
suit
within
30
days
as
the
letter
specified
he
would
have
to
do.
this
was
all
premised
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
record
does
not
reflect
it.
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
in
any
event,
the
kind
of
inquiry
to
be
made
in
a
case
like
this
essentially,
is
a
matter
well
within
the
civil
service
commission’s
expertise,
namely,
whether
the
kinds
of
considerations
brought
out
in
this
report
of
the
hearing
are
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
are
plausibly
relied
upon
in
selecting
someone
for
promotion
when
the
individual
applicants
do
not
differ
from
each
other
on
the
basis
of
race,
as
is
often
the
case.
and
this
is
a
matter
well
within
competence
and
experience
of
the
civil
service
commission.
most
of
the
policies
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
are
fully
applicable
here.
the
administrative
process
is
able
to
give
the
complete
relief
asked
for
in
the
compliant
in
the
court
and
thereby
obviate
the
need
for
any
resort
to
the
court
if
the
case
is
meritorious.
there
is
a
role
to
be
played
by
the
application
of
expertise
in
assessing
the
factual
situation
because
it
is
basically
a
factual
case,
not
as
it
reaches
this
court,
but
the
claim
was
basically
a
factual
case
and
there
would
at
least
be
an
opportunity
for
narrowing
the
issues
for
a
judicial
review.
the
considerations
that
have
normally
been
recited
as
reasons
for
requiring
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
are
all
fully
applicable
to
this
situation.
now,
we
are
told
that,
nonetheless,
this
court
held
in
johnson
against
railway
express
co.
that
at
least
as
to
claims
under
section
1981,
administrative
remedies
need
not
be
exhausted
and
indeed
cannot
be
exhausted
in
some
situations
under
title
vii.
but
johnson,
it
seems
to
us,
reserved
the
kind
of
issue
involved
here.
it
was
written
much
more
narrowly
and
carefully
than
that.
the
issue
in
johnson
was
rather
resort
to
the
eeoc
conciliation
processes
was
required
before
a
1981
suit
could
be
filed
in
a
private
employment
situation
in
which
congress
has
not
provided
a
federal
administrative
remedy
which
can
afford
the
complete
relief
sought
in
a
1981
suit.
and
the
court
carefully
noted
in
footnote
3
of
the
johnson
opinion
in
dealing
with
an
alternative
argument,
and
this
is
on
page
456
and
457
of
421
us,
that
the
complainant
there
had
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedy
under
the
railway
labor
act
where
congress
had
provided
a
complete
administrative
remedy
that
could
give
him
relief,
according
to
the
claim,
that
it
did
not
have
to
reach
that
issue
because
of
its
holding
on
the
limitations
issue
which
was
the
controlling
issue
in
johnson,
that
the
suit
was
filed
out
of
time.
and
therefore,
we
have
no
occasion
here
to
express
a
view
as
to
whether
or
not
section
1981
claim
of
employment
discrimination
is
ever
subject
to
a
requirement
that
administrative
remedies
be
exhausted
in
a
situation
where
congress
has
provided
a
full
administrative
remedy
that
can
give
the
relief
sought
in
the
suit.
and,
again,
on
page
466,
the
opinion
is
carefully
tailored
to
the
private
employment
situation.
so,
one
of
our
contentions
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
ruled
in
this
case
that
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed
for
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
that
was
an
alternative
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
dismissal
of
the
compliant
by
the
district
court
for
want
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
once
the
district
court
granted
the
government’s
motion
to
dismiss
for
want
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
of
course,
the
question
of
the
exhaustion
did
not
arise
in
the
district
court,
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
interested
in
that
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
dismissal
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
respect
to
all
of
the
claims,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
pass
on
whether
relief
under
any
of
these
theories
would
be
available.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
our
contention
is
that
congress
intended
title
vii
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy,
but
if
it
were
not
the
exclusive
remedy,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
normal
rule
would
apply
when
this
lawsuit
is
brought
after
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedy,
the
suit
should
be
based
on
a
review
of
the
record
and
the
administrative
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
what
they
were
to
take
into
consideration
was
the
substantive
standards
under
title
vii
which
are,
for
these
purposes,
basically
the
same.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
related,
as
you
say,
to
the
issue
in
chandler.
we
do
not
believe
that
after
this
elaborate
administrative
inquiry
into
what
is
essentially
a
factual
claim
that
a
de
novo
suit
would
be
warranted,
and
the
first
point
to
be
made
with
respect
to
that
is
that
congress
was,
as
we
view
the
legislative
history,
establishing
what
we
regard
as
the
exclusive
remedy
to
handle
these
federal
employment
discrimination
claims,
a
remedy
which
combined
both
an
administrative
process
and
judicial
review
of
these
claims
with
administrative
responsibilities
to
administer
effective
measures
of
what
might
be
considered
preventive
medicine
as
a
very
important
part
of
this
process.
the
new
statute,
section
717,
which
is
reproduced
on
page
16a
and
17a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
this
case
has
elaborate
provisions
in
subsection
b
about
the
responsibility
of
the
civil
service
commission
to
supervise
the
agencies
of
the
government
in
establishing
equal
opportunity
plans
of
employment
and
reviewing
those
plans
and
the
procedures
used
in
the
various
programs
that
are
known
as
affirmative
action,
upward
mobility,
the
federal
women’s
program,
etcetera.
this
is
to
a
large
extent,
where
the
action
has
been,
so
to
speak,
in
this
field,
i
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
to
each
member
of
the
court
testimony
last
june
given
by
chairman
hampton
of
the
civil
service
commission
to
the
subcommittee
on
equal
opportunities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
but
these
hearings
are
published.
the
committee
has
published
these
hearings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
gave
it
to
him
yesterday.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
these
are
public
records
and
the
point
to
be
made
is
that
the
complaints
process
and
the
examination
of
the
complaints
process
is
not
the
only
method
that
congress
specified
or
indeed
the
congress
is
looking
into
in
its
continuing
supervision
of
this
area
in
alleviating
problems
in
the
federal
civil
service.
and
the
statistical
report
gave
some
examples
of
the
inquiries
in
minority
group
representation
at
various
grade
levels
during
the
period
from
1971-1974,
at
a
time
when
overall
federal
employment
was
decreasing.
in
the
notation
with
respect
to
grade
gs9
which
is
what
the
application
was
for
in
this
case
and
that
is
on
page
4
and,
of
course,
giving
these
statistics
indicated
that
there
has
been
an
increase
of
some
2,800
minority
personnel
in
that
particular
grade
level
and
there
are
comparable
figures
more
than
2,000
increase
with
respect
to
grade
gs12,
etcetera.
now,
to
a
small
extent,
those
increases
may
reflect
the
resolution
of
the
complaints
procedures,
the
kind
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
but
for
the
most
part,
they
represent
the
implementation
of
the
affirmative
action
programs
that
the
commission
has
undertaken
and
the
review
that
it
conducts
through
its
bureau
of
personnel
management
evaluation
of
the
equal
opportunity
employment
plans
that
the
agencies
are
required
to
have.
and
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
administrative
process
that
was
established
in
the
1972
act
is
that
in
the
course
of
ruling
and
investigating
the
individual
complaint,
the
complaints
examiner
is
also
trained
to
evaluate
the
overall
program
of
the
agency
in
this
area
and
to
make
recommendations,
to
make
that
overall
program
more
effective
regardless
of
what
he
finds
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
the
particular
individual
whether
that
individual
has
a
claim
of
discrimination
against
himself
has
merit
or
not.
the
regulations
that
we
have
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
regulation
on
the
hearing
specifies
on
page
38a
that
the
examiner
is
to
look
into
not
only
the
matter
which
gave
rise
to
the
complaint
but
also
the
general
environment
out
of
which
the
complaint
arose
and
he
is
to
make
his
recommended
decision
to
the
agency
on
the
merits
of
the
complaint,
including
the
recommended
remedial
action
where
appropriate,
and
also
his
recommendations
with
regard
to
the
general
environment
out
of
which
the
complaint
arose.
in
a
case
such
as
the
present
one,
these
promotion
cases,
this
is
not
particularly
a
typical
and
many
of
them,
of
course,
do
not
even
reach
the
courts,
these
promotion
cases
are
the
most
frequent
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
complaints.
in
a
case
such
as
this
one,
it
seems
likely
to
us
that
that
aspect
of
the
compliant
examiner’s
function
is
more
likely
to
be
fruitful
than
a
ruling
on
the
merits
where
it
is
very
difficult
for
any
tribunal,
administrative
or
judicial
to
second
guess
the
determination
of
the
person
responsible
for
the
program
as
to
which
--
the
person
is
rated
as
highly
qualified,
he
wants
to
rely
on
to
carry
on
the
program,
so
long
as
he
has
reasons
that
are
independent
of
racial
consideration
in
such
matters.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
not
taken
a
position
on
that
issue
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
that
question
and
as
we
understood
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
first
question
presented
was
a
question
with
respect
to
the
issue
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
it
has
been
rephrased
in
petitioner’s
brief
so
as
to
present
that
issue,
but
we
did
not
think
it
had
been
presented
to
the
court.
now,
what
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
this,
but
the
fact
is
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
in
this
court
in
which
the
court
has
concluded
that
a
comprehensive
remedy
established
to
deal
with
a
particular
subject
matter
was
intended
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy
without
determining
whether
other
more
generally
worded
statutes
would
otherwise
be
applicable.
one
that
we
have
discussed
at
some
detail
in
our
brief
is
the
preiser
case
and
that
is
exactly
the
approach
that
the
court
took
in
the
preiser
against
rodriguez
and
i
refer
you
particularly
to
411
u.s.
at
488
and
489.
there
had
been
a
series
of
other
cases
that
are
not
cited
in
the
brief
which
i
do
want
to
call
the
court’s
attention
in
which
the
same
conclusion
was
reached
with
respect
to
compensation
statutes,
both
prisoner’s
compensation
and
seaman’s
compensation
statutes,
and
i
did
inform
counsel
of
these
cases
yesterday
also
mr.
justice.

now
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
alright.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
for
one
thing,
the
proposition
that
repeals
by
implication
are
not
favored
which
the
court
applied
in
morton
against
mancari
was
a
proposition
applicable
there
to
two
disparate
federal
policies
reflected
in
two
different
statutes,
one
favoring
indian
self
government
through
the
indian
preference
and
the
indian
bureau
of
affairs
and,
the
other,
the
discrimination
in
employment
law
which
the
court
found
not
to
be
irreconcilable.
and
in
the
absence
of
any
congressional
indication
that
it
was
seeking
to
supersede
one
with
the
other,
the
court
held
that
the
two
should
be
given
effect
and
could
be
given
effect.
that
is
quite
different
from
the
kinds
of
cases
i
have
just
mentioned
in
which
it
was
determined
that
congress
undertook
to
deal
comprehensively
with
a
particular
problem
and
thereby
to
supersede
any
judicial
remedy
that
might
otherwise
exist
under
more
generally
worded
statutes
which
have
not,
at
the
time
congress
was
dealing
with
the
issue,
been
applied
to
that
problem.
and
that
is
what
we
are
involved
with
here.
the
committee
reports
in
both
the
house
and
senate,
and
they
are
set
out
in
some
detail
on
page
31
of
the
chandler
brief
that
we
have
filed
both
in
the
text
and
in
the
footnote
there,
show
that
congress
thought
that
there
was
no
other
remedy
and
was
enacting
what
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
congress,
in
acting
here,
decided
that
this
was
the
remedy
that
should
exist
in
a
situation
in
which
it
assumed
that
this
was
the
only
remedy
that
would
exist.
it
is
quite
different
from
the
discussion
of
the
related
question
in
jones
against
mayer
in
which
both
the
hearings
and
the
discussion
on
the
floor
had
indicated
that
that
case
was
in
litigation
that
there
might
be
a
remedy
under
1982
and
that,
nonetheless,
this
alternative
remedy
was
needed,
that
both
remedies
were
needed.
the
same
thing
was
true
with
respect
to
the
application
of
title
vii
to
private
employment.
it
was
specifically
noted
that
there
were
remedies
under
state
fair
employment
practices
laws
and
in
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and,
the
intention
was
to
preserve
the
preexisting
remedies
and
add
a
remedy
that
would
supplement
rather
than
supplant
them,
as
the
court
said.
with
respect
to
1981,
however,
the
indications
in
congress
was
that
they
thought
there
was
not
access
to
the
courts
in
any
other
way
and
that
they
would
set
up
a
comprehensive
plan
to
deal
with
this
through
an
amalgam
of
administrative
and
judicial
remedies,
and
there
was
good
reason
for
congressional
doubt
that
the
sovereign
immunity
had
otherwise
been
waived.
jones
against
mayer
had
indicated
in
footnote
13
of
that
opinion
that
1982,
the
companion
provision,
is
couched
merely
in
declaratory
terms.
it
provides
no
other
explicit
method
of
enforcement,
but
that
of
course,
does
not
prevent
a
federal
court
from
fashioning
an
effective
equitable
remedy.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
the
court
says
about
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
there
has
been
no
holding
that
these
statutes
authorize
suit
against
government.
hurd
against
hodge
in
which
it
was
how
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
state
or
territory
within
the
meaning
of
those
statutes,
was
a
companion
case
to
shelley
against
kramer
involving
suit
between
private
individuals
to
enforce
a
restrictive
covenant.
there
has
never
been
a
case
holding
that
suit
against
the
government
has
been
authorized
by
1981
or
1982.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
there,
the
courts
had
indicated
that
when
those
suits
are
attempting
to
get
a
promotion
within
the
civil
service,
they
are
effectively
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
that
is
what
the
eighth
circuit
had
held
in
the
gnotta
case
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
not
been
resolved
here,
but
it
was
the
premise
on
which
congress
acted
and
it
has
been
resolved
by
one
justice
here,
but
not
by
the
court.[laughter]
and
it
was
the
premise
on
which
the
court
acted
as
reflected
in
those
committee
reports.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[laughter]as
i
have
indicated,
i
think
they
are
carefully
written
not
to
cover
cases
that
were
not
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
both
parties
have
agreed
that
when
the
administrative
claim
was
still
pending
on
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
that
under
bradley
against
richmond
school
district
that
the
new
statute
applies.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
issue
between
the
parties
as
to
that
and
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
litigated
in
the
court
of
appeals.
at
that
time,
the
government
had
not
resolved
a
position
to
take
into
the
courts
on
that
question.
we
since
have.
we
have
filed
a
response
to
it.
it
is
still
pending,
petition
for
rehearing
on
that
issue
in
a
case
called
place
against
weinberger
in
which
we
have
confessed
error
on
that
question
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
still
pending
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
a
petition
for
rehearing
that
was
filed
last
term
into
which
our
response
was
filed
by
request
last
term.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
or
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
the
exhaustion
issue
it
need
not
reach
the
other
issue.
either
one
could
be
dispositive
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
either
one
by
itself
could
be
dispositive,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
because
the
complainant
did
not
comply
with
the
30-day
time
limitation
providing
the
suit
under
title
vii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you.
