all
this

not?

mr.
wallace,
can
you
clarify
something
for
me?
i
may
not
have
followed
your
argument
completely,
but
does
the
government
agree
that
prior
to
1972
there
would
have
been
a
1981
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
necessarily
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
position
is
correct
that
7,
whatever
the
number
is,
is
an
exclusive
remedy,
that
conclusion
could
only
be
reached
by
holding
that
the
1972
statute
amended
1981,
if
in
fact
there
is
a
1981
claim,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
