mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1972,
congress
amended
title
vii
of
the
1965
civil
rights
act
to
authorized
federal
employees
who
have
been
the
victims
of
employment
discrimination
to
sue
under
title
vii.
that
amendment
precipitated
a
number
of
suits
by
aggrieved
federal
employees
both
under
title
vii
and
as
in
the
instant
case,
under
other
statutes,
particularly
the
1866
civil
rights
act
which
is
now
codified
as
42
u.s.c.
section
1981.
in
the
resulting
litigation,
the
government
has
raised
a
number
of
procedural
issues
as
to
what
judicial
remedies
shall
be
enjoyed
by
federal
employees.
by
and
large,
these
are
the
same
procedural
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
past
by
private
employers
also
seeking
to
defend
title
vii
or
section
1981
actions.
this
case
presents
two
of
those
issues.
in
july
of
1971,
petitioner
filed
an
administrative
complaint
with
the
general
services
administration,
alleging
that
his
superiors
had
denied
him
a
promotion
on
account
of
his
race.
in
march
of
1973,
after
almost
two
years
of
administrative
proceedings,
the
agency
found
itself
innocent
of
those
charges.
having
thus
obtained
final
agency
action,
petitioner
sued
on
may
7,
1973
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
jurisdiction
was
alleged
to
exist
under
a
variety
statutes,
including
section
1981.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
none
of
the
statutes
alleged,
on
their
face
confer
jurisdiction
over
the
claim
at
issue.
on
appeal,
two
somewhat
different
arguments
were
raised
in
the
second
circuit.
first,
that
the
1866
civil
rights
act
insofar
as
it
conferred
jurisdiction
over
federal
employees’
claims
of
employment
discrimination,
and
then
repealed
by
congress
in
1972
when
it
amended
title
vii.
and
second,
it
was
suggested
that
prior
to
suit
under
section
1981,
an
employee,
at
least
of
the
federal
government
must
pursue
his
administrative
remedy
such
as
they
are
all
the
way
through
the
appeals
review
board.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
both
of
these
contentions
and
affirmed
the
dismissal.
we
sought
certiorari,
stressing
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
regard
to
rights
of
federal
employees
was
in
conflict
with
the
decisions
of
a
number
of
circuits
and
of
this
court,
particularly
with
the
right
of
private
employees
under
the
same
circumstances.
subsequent
to
the
grant
of
certiorari
and
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
this
court
decided
johnson
against
the
railway
express
agency
and
held,
with
regard
to
private
employees
who
sued
under
1981,
that
1981
was
not
repealed
by
title
vii
and
that
there
is
no
obligation
to
exhaust
the
title
vii
administrative
procedures
and
indeed,
under
certain
circumstances,
that
it
is
not
permissible
to
try
do
so.
we
believe
that
in
that
regard
johnson
was
correctly
decided
and
should
be
applied
here.
our
brief
spells
out
a
variety
of
statutes
other
than
title
vii,
affording
varying
remedies
to
federal
employees
who
have
been
victims
of
unlawful
employment
discrimination.
the
most
important
of
these
is
section
1981
which
is,
indeed
the
same
jurisdictional
basis
as
was
discussed
this
morning
in
washington
against
davis.
the
scheme
which
we
have
laid
out
presents,
we
think,
the
same
pattern
of
independent
overlapping
remedies
that
exists
for
private
employees
who
are
aggrieved
by
employment
discrimination.
the
government
maintains,
however,
that
all
of
these
statutes
and
particularly
the
1866
civil
rights
act
were
tacitly
repealed
by
congress
in
1972
when
it
adapted
the
amendment
to
title
vii
which
i
have
mentioned.
in
dealing
with
this
contention,
the
court
happily
does
not
have
to
write
on
a
blank
slate.
for
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
suggestion
have
been
raised
in
this
court
that
the
1866
civil
rights
act
has
been
repealed
pro
tanto
by
more
recent
legislation.
to
be
exact,
this
is
the
fourth
time
in
a
decade
that
that
contention
has
been
raised
here.
in
jones
against
the
alfred
mayer
co.
it
was
argued
that
the
1866
civil
rights
act
insofar
as
it
created
a
cause
of
action
for
individuals
aggrieved
by
housing
discrimination
had
been
repealed
by
title
viii
of
the
1868
civil
rights
act.
this
court
rejected
that
contention.
a
similar
contention
was
raised
in
sullivan
against
little
hunting
park
with
regard
to
the
1866
civil
rights
act
insofar
as
it
gave
a
cause
of
action
for
a
victim
of
discrimination
of
public
accommodations,
and
again
that
argument
was
rejected.
and
of
course,
most
recently
in
johnson
against
rea,
the
court
held
that
the
passage
of
title
vii
did
not
repeal
1981
insofar
as
it
created
a
cause
of
action
for
private
employees.
we
think
that
these
cases
are
correct
and
that
the
reasons
in
them
should
be
applied
here.
the
statute
involved
which
is
section
717
of
title
vii
does
not
purport
on
its
face
to
repeal
anything.
it
simply
provides
in
two
sentences
that
federal
employee
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
after
certain
administrative
procedures
have
been
followed
and
provides
that,
by
reference
to
the
other
provisions
of
title
vii,
the
procedures
once
in
court
shall
be
essentially
the
same
as
the
procedures
afforded
to
private
plaintiffs.
in
our
judgment,
that
language
of
the
statute
is
essentially
the
end
of
the
court’s
inquiry.
this
court
in
morton
against
mancari
held
that
a
clear
and
unequivocal
congressional
intent
was
required
in
order
for
the
court
to
include
that
congress
had
sub
silentio
repealed
earlier
legislation.
that
rule,
of
course,
goes
back
at
least
a
century
and
there
is
nothing
here
to
justify
any
such
finding
of
repeal.
throughout
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
amendments,
no
one
in
the
senate
or
the
house,
no
witness,
and
no
report
with
an
exception
i
shall
come
to,
made
any
mention
of
repealing
anything,
suggested
that
any
rights
of
federal
employees
might
have,
might
be
excessive
or
suggested
that
they
thought
that
title
vii
in
any
regard
ought
to
be
an
exclusive
remedy.
the
exception,
of
course
is
the
amendment
proposed
by
senator
roscoe
in
the
senate
which
would
have
expressly
made
title
vii
an
exclusive
remedy,
and
that
amendment
was
rejected.
we
think,
for
this
reason,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong,
including
that
section
1981
has
been
repealed
and
that
that
statute
as
indeed
the
other
statues
involved
still
exist
and
can
be
relied
on
by
federal
employers.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
debates
focused
on
the
question
of
private
employers.
there
are
some
question
as
to
whether
the
statute,
if
adapted,
would
have
covered
federal
employers.
as
you
will
recall,
section
717
(d)
provides
that
section
706
(f)
though
(k)
shall
apply
to
federal
employment
litigation
and
the
roscoe
amendment
would
have
been
section
706
(f).
whether
because
of
the
language
of
that
statute
referring
to
employers,
it
would
or
it
would
not
have
been
technically
applicable
to
federal
employees
is
i
think
a
somewhat
of
an
open
question,
but
it
certainly
does
not
--
congress
is
silent
on
that
regard
and
that
is
the
most
that
it
is.
it
does
not
involve
the
clear
and
manifest
congressional
intent
that
this
court
required
in
morton
against
mancari
to
find
a
repeal
of
any
preexisting
statute.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
legislative
justification
of
our
contention
that
these
other
statutes
waive
sovereign
immunity
is
of
course
not
to
be
found
in
1972
when
other
legislation
was
before
congress.
in
that
regard,
one
would
have
to
look
to
the
legislative
histories
of
very
statute
involved.
but
at
the
outset,
there
are
a
number
of
claims
raised
by
this
case
that
would
be
litigable
even
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
for
what
is
alleged
here
is
a
violation
of
the
law,
of
employment
discrimination
which
violates,
among
other
things,
the
fifth
amendment,
an
executive
order,
regulation
and
three
statutes.
now,
if
the
defendant
individual
supervisors
were
engaged
in
such
unlawful
conduct,
they
did
not
do
so
as
arms
of
the
sovereign,
but
were
engaged
rather
in
a
manner
of
the
defendants
in
ex
parte
young
and
essentially
a
frolic
in
detour
on
their
own
and
sovereign
immunity
simply
would
not
protect
them.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
you
need
not,
because
there
are
individual
defendants
in
this
action
who
would
be
liable
for
injunctive
relief.
in
addition,
as
we
have
noted
on
our
brief,
with
regard
to
backpay,
we
are
in
a
somewhat
unusual
situation
in
that
a
ministerial
duty
to
pay
backpay
exists
under
the
regulations.
under
that
somewhat
unusual
circumstance,
injunctive
relief
for
mandamus,
if
you
will,
would
lie
to
compel
the
payment
of
the
backpay,
although
other
kinds
of
monetary
relief
would
require
waive
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
if
petitioner
was
the
most
qualified
person
for
the
promotion
he
would
seek
and
if
his
supervisors
decided
to
promote
someone
else
purely
on
the
basis
of
race,
that
decision
was
not
a
decision
protected
by
sovereign
immunity,
anymore
than
the
decision
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
deny
a
commission
of
justice
to
the
peace
to
mr.
william
mulberry
was.
i
do
not
see
a
whole
lot
of
distinction
there.
i
am
sure
it
was
argued
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
certainly
did,
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
they
have,
but
like
some
1982
suits
with
regard
to
public
housing
and
public
accommodations,
they
were
only
recently
discovered.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
or
even
private
housing,
but
that
is
no
different
than
the
situation
with
regard
to
the
1866
civil
rights
act
generally.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
does
not.
i
can
understand
how
it
could
if
a
suit
to
get
a
commissioner
as
justice
of
the
peace
would
not
require
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
this
court
held
in
one
of
its
earliest
decisions
that
no
such
waiver
was
required.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if
the
defendant
individuals
denied
the
promotion
for
the
reason
alleged,
they
had
no
lawful
authority
to
do
so,
and
we
are
acting
here
as
private
attorney
generals
getting
to
respond
once
again
to
the
will
of
a
sovereign.
i
would
like
to
turn
next
to
the
problem
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
again,
i
will
note
that
this
question
was
considered
and
resolved
with
regard
to
private
employees
in
johnson
against
rea,
and
we
think
that
the
decision
in
that
case
should
be
applied
here.
the
facts
of
this
case
are,
in
this
regard,
somewhat
important.
in
june
of
1971,
petitioner
came
forward
and
affirmatively
complained
of
employment
discrimination,
in
that
instance
too
an
eeo
counselor.
that
complaint,
however,
under
the
regulations
was
not
sufficient
to
trigger
a
plenary
civil
service
commission
inquiry.
instead,
all
it
got
plaintiff
was
some
counseling.
second,
on
july
1971,
a
plaintiff
again
came
forward
and
again
complained
that
he
was
aggrieved
by
employment
discrimination,
this
time
indicating
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
informal
counseling
he
had
received.
that
second
act,
however,
was
also
not
sufficient
to
trigger
plenary
inquiry.
all
it
got
petitioner
was
a
letter,
a
permission
to
file
a
written
complaint.
that
written
complaint
was
filed
in
july
15,
1971.
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
government’s
own
regulations
required
that
any
administrative
complaint
of
employment
discrimination
be
processed
through
final
agency
action
within
60
days.
617
days
later,
on
march
23,
1973,
a
final
agency
action
occurred
and
the
general
service
administration
concluded
that
it
not
been
guilty
of
employment
discrimination
as
petitioner
charged.
at
that
point,
to
be
sure
as
now,
the
regulations
did
not
purport
to
require
a
complainant
to
process
that
appeal
the
one
remaining
step
which
existed,
namely
to
the
appeals
review
board
of
the
civil
service
commission.
plaintiff,
thereupon,
sued
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
at
the
time,
it
was
asserted
and
not
denied
that
by
proceeding
all
the
way
through
final
agency
action,
petitioner
had
adequately
exhausted
administrative
remedies.
the
government
did
not
deny
that
in
the
district
court
and
indeed,
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
briefs
did
not
deny
that
contention.
however,
in
june
of
1974
oral
argument,
the
government
advanced
what
i
characterize
as
its
first
exhaustion
rule,
namely
that
a
federal
employee
had
to
pursue
any
claim
of
employment
discrimination
all
the
way
through
the
appeals
review
board
and
essentially
without
exception.
second,
in
opposing
certiorari
in
march
of
1975,
the
government
suggested
a
second
rule,
namely
that
an
aggrieved
employee
could
sue
after
final
agency
action,
but
only
if
he
did
so
within
30
days
of
that
action.
and
finally
in
its
brief
filed
on
october
of
1975,
a
full
29
months
after
this
suit
was
begun,
the
government
suggested
yet
a
third
rule,
namely
that
an
aggrieved
employee
could
sue
if
the
government
had
delayed
unduly
in
processing
his
complaint,
provided
he
had
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies
for
such
delay.
none
of
these
rules,
of
course
were
known
or
indeed
foreseeable
at
the
time
when
plaintiff
decided
to
bring
this
action.
the
case
in
the
briefs
before
the
court
present
a
variety
of
possible
rules
that
might
be
adapted
with
regard
to
exhaustion.
the
first
rule,
and
one
we
think
preferable,
is
not
to
require
exhaustion
at
all
for
federal
employees
just
as
it
is
not
required
for
state
and
local
government
employees
or
for
private
employees.
a
second
possible
rule
suggested
by
the
government’s
brief
in
chandler
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
only
to
notice
of
the
claim
and
to
cooperation
with
any
investigation
the
government
chooses
to
pursue.
that
of
course
was
given
in
this
case.
a
third
possible
rule
would
be
essentially
congruent
with
that
with
regard
to
title
vii,
namely
that
after
final
agency
action,
a
federal
employee
is
free
to
sue
without
further
exhaustion
or
the
court
might
hold
that
after
the
completion
of
the
180-day
deadline
set
by
the
government’s
own
regulations,
an
employee
was
free
to
sue.
fifth,
the
court
could,
and
i
think
it
certainly
would
be
required
in
any
case,
to
adapt
the
rule
that
in
any
particular
case
an
aggrieved
employee
would
be
entitled
to
show
as
to
his
particular
case
that
further
exhaustion
would
have
been
futile.
