justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
roscoe
amendment
directed
to
private
employment
or
to
public
employment
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
alternative,
of
course,
would
be
the
opposite
rule
that
has
been
involved
in
many
cases,
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
exhaustion
and
it
is
up
to
the
person
who
claims
that
exhaustion
would
be
futile,
but
make
it
a
rather
specific
showing
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
say
that
the
findings
of
the
civil
rights
commission
can
conclude
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
the
way
you
would
interpret
that
is
to
say
that
if
they
are
entitled
the
weight
that
it
supports
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
not
require
exhaustion,
that
you
do
not
use
that
as
an
independent
lever
by
which
this
court
simply
concludes
on
its
own
that
exhaustion
is
not
required?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
true
in
the
normal
administrative
situation
where
you
have
a
presumption
that
the
administrative
remedies
are
going
to
be
exhausted.
you
have
a
trial
in
every
individual
case
as
to
whether,
with
respect
to
this
particular
litigant,
he
might
or
might
not
have
gotten
some
relief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
in
the
record,
mr.
wallace?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
opposing
counsel
had
any
notice
of
this
distribution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
little
bit
late,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
there
be
expressed
saving
language
in
the
1964
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
30-day
statute
of
limitations,
do
you
mean
at
the
time
of
award
of
maximum
backpay,
there
can
be
award
as
30
days?
