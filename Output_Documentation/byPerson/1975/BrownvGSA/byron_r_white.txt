how
about
clear
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
except
with
respect
to
when
it
clearly
said
they
were
waiving
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
are
going
to
find
to
sustain
your
1981
claim
on
evidence
if
congress
waives
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
positive
action
in
that
sense?

1981
case
of
a
backpay?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
a
1981
case
for
a
promotion?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
those
kinds
of
1981
suits
that
certainly
existed
prior
to
1972?
justice
byron
r.
white
always
had
existed,
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
a
promotion
suit
necessarily
involve
or
requires
a
showing
of
a
sovereign
immunity
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
both
the
1981
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
next
case
then?
suppose
that
there
was
the
exhaustion
requirement
applicable
to
1981.
the
claim
was
rejected
in
the
administrative
process,
would
the
1981
suit
then
go
forward
in
court
or
would
there
be
a
--
there
could
not
be
a
review
on
the
record,
could
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
act
in
terms
of
the
procedure
and
the
hearings
that
the
administrators
would
take
1981
into
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
follow
though
that
if
the
administrators
rejected
whatever
claim
it
was
they
were
considering,
that
the
1981
suit
would
then
go
on
to
court
de
novo?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
the
1981
action
prior
to
1972
which
i
think
you
do
not
take
the
position
on
it,
you
must
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
assume
that
there
was.
you
just
started
out
on
that
assumption
and
then
arrived
at
your
conclusions.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
unroll
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
assumption
that
there
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
against
individuals,
individual
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
not
been
resolved
here
though?
