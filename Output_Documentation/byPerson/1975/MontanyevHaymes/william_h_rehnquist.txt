justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
second
circuit
would
have
said
he
suffered
a
grievous
loss
if
he
had
been
moved
from
one
cell
block
to
another
in
the
same
prison,
presumably
he
would
have
been
moved
away
from
some
of
his
buddies
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
transfer
were
designed
to
not
discipline
him
in
any
generals
sense,
but
simply
remove
him
to
a
place
where
he
would
have
no
access
to
his
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
under
the
procedural
due
process,
but
denial
of
ego?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lewittes,
i
think
maybe
your
response
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
maybe
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
what
i
understood
your
earlier
response
to
justice
stevens
and
my
questions
were
and
perhaps
i
am
wrong.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
as
long
as
he
is
challenging
the
matter
here
under
procedural
due
process
and
not
denial
of
access
to
the
courts
or
to
lawyers
that
he
have
to
establish
some
sort
of
liberty
or
property
interest
before
you
ever
got
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
something
punitive
done
and
unless
he
has
a
liberty
or
property
interest
in
the
lunch
hour
right,
the
state
is
perfectly
free
to
transfer
him
from
one
lunch
hour
to
another
and
say
we
are
doing
it
because
we
do
not
like
the
way
you
are
acting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
stick
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewittes,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
if
i
may.
supposing
that
the
respondent
here
had
been
appointed
by
the
warden
as
kind
of
a
special
assistant
to
help
in
the
warden’s
office
and
the
warden
was
dissatisfied
with
his
behavior
and
said
i
am
going
to
fire
you
from
the
special
assistant
because
you
are
going
to
back
with
the
mass
of
the
pressures
just
to
punish
you
for
the
way
you
have
been
acting.
now,
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
liberty
or
property
interest
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
same
would
be
true
with
respect
to
the
laws
of
good
term
credits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
not
a
denial
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
procedural
due
process,
is
it?
that
is
burdening
a
substantive
constitutional
right
that
he
has?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
is
what
the
second
circuit
relied
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
those
that
who
were
quite
different,
are
they
not,
to
say
simply
he
was
engaged
in
lawful
conduct
and
to
say
he
was
engaged
in
constitutionally
protected
conduct,
well,
those
are
quite
different?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
which
do
the
court
of
appeals
hold?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
under
your
submission
do
you
say
he
should
have
a
title
on
right
to
argue
about
whether
or
not
under
the
balancing
the
constitutional
conduct
could
be
dealt
with
this
way
by
the
prison
authorities?
you
also
say
you
should
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
as
to
whether
he
violated
a
rule,
i
do
not
see
why
that
--
the
latter
follow?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the
state
need
to
show
any
violation
of
a
rule
before
it
transfers
a
man
from
one
person
to
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
should
there
be
a
hearing
about
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
nebraska,
the
statute
provided
for
good
time
credit.
you
are
suggesting
that
just
some
sort
of
informal
decision
making
creates
the
same
sort
of
expectation
as
a
statutory
promise?
