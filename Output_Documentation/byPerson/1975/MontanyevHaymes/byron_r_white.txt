justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
view
the
statement
in
wolfe
that
procedure
of
due
process
is
implicated
if
a
person
is
sent
to
solitary
confinement
for
breaching
the
rule?
is
it
because
the
status
promised
in
advance
that
you
will
not
be
sent
there
unless
you
violate
a
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that
is
the
only
answer.
you
are
in
a
little
trouble
here,
are
you
not?
do
you
not
have
to
â€“-
what
is
the
property
or
liberty
interest
which
you
claim
is
the
predicate?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
state
has
rules
and
published
rules
which
at
least
imply
that
you
will
not
be
in
solitary
unless
you
break
the
rules?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
making
was
not
expressed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
they
reached
a
right
result
but
for
a
reason
what
you
like
to
explain?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
then
--
i
will
ask
you.
would
you
like
to
defend
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
the
way
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
is
that
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
get
relief,
just
to
prove
that
you
suffered
a
grievous
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
court
of
appeals?
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
was
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
agree
that
it
would
not
be
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
go
ahead
then,
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
he
claims
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
he
was
transferred?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
would
the
hearing
be
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
the
factual
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
no
question
about
what
he
was
doing,
is
there?
he
was
circulating
this
piece
of
paper.
there
is
not
any
question
about
what
his
physical
acts
were
and
what
was
on
the
paper
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
just
ought
to
be
an
argument
on
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
short,
you
want
to
argue
about
the
law,
is
that
not
right?
you
want
to
get
to
the
merits
of
whether
they
would
be
entitled
to
transfer
him
for
allegedly
violating
a
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
really
is
any
fact,
historical
factual
question
like
who
did
what
to
whom
or
what
actually
happened
on
a
certain
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
accuracy
problem
here,
is
there,
about
what
his
conduct
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
how
to
characterize
them,
but
not
about
actually
what
he
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
liberty
interest
was
involved
in
that
allegation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
liberty
interest
was
involved
in
that
--
in
his
job
in
the
library?
justice
byron
r.
white
making
a
major
amendment
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
opinion,
but
you
are
not
foreclose
from
presenting
that
ground
for
a
permanent
side,
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you?
suppose
a
separate
liberty
interest
were
not
involved,
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
first
amendment,
that
suppose
two
prisoners
were
found
to
have
violated
the
rule
of
the
prison
against
trashing
the
library
or
something
like
that
and
one
of
them
was
sent
to
solitary
or
say
one
of
them
was
deprived
of
the
good
time
and
the
other
one
was
just
transferred
to
another
prison
and
concededly
both
consequences
followed
from
the
violation
of
the
rule.
neither
was
given
a
hearing.
would
both
of
them
be
entitled
to
hearing
under
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
there
in
far
as
good
time
is
concerned,
i
thought
the
court
said
that
the
state
created
the
expectation
of
good
time
and
promised
that
it
would
not
be
taken
away
unless
some
rule
was
violated?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
not
what
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
now,
do
you
know
of
any
rule
in
any
of
the
new
york
prisons
that
were
already
or
any
indication
that
any
of
the
regulations
that
there
are
some
promise
that
you
will
not
be
transferred
unless
you
violate
a
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
expectation
of
not
being
transferred?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
might
have
promised
him,
they
are
not
put
him
in
solitary
or
deprive
him
of
good
time
if
he
violated
--unless
he
violated
the
rule,
but
is
there
some
promise
that
you
will
not
be
transferred?
justice
byron
r.
white
prison
regulations,
the
imposition
of
that
kind
of
serious
punishment
was
conditioned
upon
the
breach
of
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
do
not
see
any
rule
in
new
york
prisons
that
say
that
we
will
not
transfer
unless
you
breach
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
outside
the
mcdonald
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
reads
to
that
effect,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
he
does
not
have
any
constitutional
right
to
assist
other
inmates?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
two
cases
raise
a
common
question.
in
the
fano
case
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
fano
was
a
state
prisoner
in
a
medium
security
institution.
he
was
transferred
to
a
maximum
security
prison.
in
haymes,
which
is
here
on
petition
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
prisoner
was
transferred
from
one
medium
security
prison
to
another.
in
each
case
the
inmate
brought
suit,
claiming
that
the
transfer
violated
his
right
to
liberty
under
the
due
process
clause
and
that
he
was
therefore
entitled
to
more
procedural
due
process
than
he
had
received
in
connection
with
his
transfer.
both
courts
of
appeals
agreed
to
the
inmate
and
ordered
the
transfer
canceled.
we
reverse
both
judgments,
since
in
our
view
no
cognizable
rights
to
liberty
of
either
inmate
were
violated
by
the
transfer.
our
reasons
are
given
at
greater
length
in
the
opinions
on
file
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
these
cases.
he
has
been
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall.
