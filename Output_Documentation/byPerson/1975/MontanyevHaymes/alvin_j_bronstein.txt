mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
questioning
of
the
court
to
my
colleague
from
new
york
clarified
the
issue,
particularly
the
questions
by
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
about
and
that
was
the
conduct
of
haymes
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
which
led
to
the
transfer
rather
than
the
transfer
itself.
what
has
not
been
discussed
yet
is
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
before
this
court.
the
state
in
their
reply
brief,
filed
last
friday,
now
concedes
that
the
district
court
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss,
that
therefore,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
must
be
construed
liberally,
must
be
assumed
to
be
true,
and
that
they
have
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
this
point
to
contradict
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
limited
its
inquiry.
it
did
not
reach
the
merits
in
this
case.
they
limited
their
inquiry
to
whether
the
complaint
stated
a
colorable
claim
and
they
appropriately
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
basically
on
three
questions.
haymes
should
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
what
his
conduct
was?
if
it
was
protected
conduct
then
he
should
have
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
there
was
casual
connection
between
his
conduct
and
the
summary
punishment
that
is
the
transfer
and
finally
if
both
of
those
could
be
proved,
whether
he
suffered
injury
and
then
the
present
status
this
court
needs
not
decide
the
merits
of
any
of
those
claims.
those
are
appropriately
for
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
in
the
light
of
the
state's
new
view
of
the
present
posture
of
the
case
is
immaterial,
i
believe,
at
this
point
whether
we
consider
this
was
a
pro
se
complaint
as
we
argue
in
point
2
of
our
brief
and
apply
the
haymes
kind
of
test
or
whether
it
is
the
traditional
rule
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
under
rule
12
as
this
court
recently
said
in
scheuer
v.
rhodes.
in
any
event
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
assumed
to
be
true,
it
must
be
read
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
it
might
only
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
injury
not
in
terms
of
the
liberty
interest
which
we
claim.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
right.
what
i
am
saying
mr.
chief
justice
is
an
answer
to,
i
think
what
mr.
justice
stevens
was
implying
before
that
the
state
could
not
punish
a
prisoner,
for
example,
for
writing
a
letter
to
the
department
of
justice
to
complain
about
racially
segregated
cell
blocks.
they
could
not
punish
him
by
transferring
him
400
miles
or
punish
him
by
transferring
20
yards,
if
he
suffered
injury.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
right.
that
is
the
liberty
interest
in
this
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
arises,
at
least
it
is
alleged
at
this
point
in
a
procedural
posture,
flows
directly
from
other
constitutional
rights
from
other
constitutional
rights
from
first,
sixth,
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
he
was
either,
depending
on
how
the
complaint
is
read,
engaging
in
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government
for
readdress
of
grievances,
the
act
of
circulating
this
petition
which
he
was
obviously
going
to
mail
to
a
government
official
or
he
was
engaging
in
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
which
were
identified
by
mr.
justice
marshall
a
while
ago.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
the
second
circuit
was
concerned
about
punishment
for
conduct
which
at
least
on
the
basis
of
a
pro
se
complaint
or
a
complaint
liberally
construed,
suggest
that
he
was
engaged
in
constitutionally
protected
activity.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
not
expressly
because
they
were
dealing
with
a
case
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
they
reached
the
right
result
and
i
think
there
is
the
suggestion,
although
it
may
not
have
been
clearly
articulated
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
that
depends
on
the
definition
of
what
it
is.
i
read
it
to
be
concerned
with
the
punitive
nature
of
the
transfer.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
enough
for
what
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think,
that
is
not
in
this
case.
that
is
not
what
this
case
is
about
in
its
posture,
but
i
do
believe
that
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
the
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
not
in
another
case.
i
do
not
agree
that
it
would
not
be
enough
for
another
case.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
based
on
the
posture
of
the
case
that
haymes
had
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
he
was
engaged
in
lawful
conduct
or
protected
conduct,
that
he
was
not
violating
any
regulation
of
the
prison
and
in
fact
was
engaged
in
constitutionally
protected
activity.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
they
are
indeed
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
they
discussed
both
or
imply
both.
it
is
not
the
clearest
decision,
i
would
admit,
but
certainly
the
complaint
which
they
had
before
them
and
what
i
wish
to
stress
is
that
what
this
court
is
considering
now
is
a
case
before
it
in
the
exact
same
posture
as
cooper
v.
pate
or
cruz
v.
beto,
a
dismissal
of
a
complaint
by
the
district
court
without
a
hearing,
without
any
responsive
pleadings
and
all
we
need
to
look
out
is
the
complaint.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
only
yes,
but
only
after
he
was
being
punished
for
some
conduct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
do
not
think
that
was
alone
what
they
were
saying
mr.
justice
stewart
because
they
took,
on
page
31(a)
of
the
appendix
in
their
opinion,
they
specifically
expressed
concern
about
the
district
court
deciding
that
the
alleged
punitive
nature
of
the
transfer
was
not
material,
the
alleged
punitive
nature.
the
alleged
punitive
nature
in
the
complaint,
eight
separate
times
in
the
complaint
haymes
alleges
that
he
was
petitioning
the
court
for
readdress
of
grievances,
five
separate
times
he
alleges
that
he
was
punished
or
retaliated
against
for
exercising
his
constitutional
right
to
petition
the
court
for
readdress
of
grievances.
the
conduct
therefore,
that
stands
out
to
me
from
the
complaint,
is
based
just
on
those
allegations
conceivably
a
liberty
interest
flowing
directly
from
our
first
amendment
right.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
what
were
the
hearing
be
about
before
the
district
court
or
in
the
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
right.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
the
hearing
would
be
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
engaged
in
protected
activity.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
it
first
is
a
factual
question.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
but
the
state
might
have
the
opportunity
under
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
no
because
the
state
would
have
to
come
in
then
and
respond
as
to
what
their
interest
would
be
in
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
first
we
would
have
to
decide
if
a
rule
was
violated.
secondly,
whether
it
if
it
was
not
whether
he
was
engaging
in
constitutionally
protected
activity.
thirdly,
was
the
state’s
interest
involved
because
some
disturbance
seemed
eminent,
the
kind
of
balancing
that
this
court
talked
about
in
procunier
against
martinez.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
in
this
case?
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well
–-
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
it
seems
there
is
some,
if
one
considers
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
by
the
district
court
then
there
is
some
conflict.
i
do
not
think
that
the
affidavits
can
be
considered.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
there
are
number
of
factual
controversies.
apparently,
his
records
indicate
that
he
was
transferred
because
of
something
he
did
in
the
law
library,
not
what
he
did
in
circulating
the
petition.
it
does
not
say
what
that
something
is.
it
merely
says
illicit
activity
in
the
law
library.
it
could
have
been
passing
contraband
or
it
could
have
been
furnishing
legal
assistance.
i
do
not
know
what
that
is.
so,
there
are
number
of
factual
controversies
if
you
look
down
the
complaint.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
pardon.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
do
not
think
his
job
in
the
library
is
in
this
case.
i
am
merely
showing
that
his
central
file
says
he
was
transferred
because
of
his
activity
in
the
law
library,
thereby
indicating
that
there
is
a
factual
controversy
if
there
were
a
hearing.
he
claims
he
was
transferred
because
he
was
circulating
a
petition
in
the
yard.
the
central
files
seem
to
suggest
otherwise.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
only
if
the
evidence
would
indicate
that
the
state's
claim
that
he
did
violate
a
rule
was
material.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
do
not
think
that
is
in
this
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
if
the
rule
were
to
infringe
on
a
separate
protected
liberty
interest,
if
the
rules
would
say
as
mr.
justice
stevens
i
think
asked
before,
you
may
not
write
to
your
lawyer
otherwise
we
will
transfer
you
or
you
may
not
complain
to
the
department
of
justice
about
racial
segregation,
otherwise
we
will
transfer
you,
then
the
rule
would
certainly
be
at
issue.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
true.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
first
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
believe
respectfully
is
not
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
but
i
think
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
in
the
question,
in
a
hypothetical
what
you
postulate,
some
minimal
inquiry
should
be
made
in
the
facts
that
you
make.
in
fact,
that
is
what
the
prison
officials
do.
before
a
prisoner
is
assigned
to
attica
or
clinton
or
a
federal
system
to
leavenworth
or
danbury,
a
case
worker,
a
classification
officer
meets
with
the
prisoner,
finds
out
what
his
potentials
are,
what
his
problems
are,
what
his
interests
are
and
then
makes
a
decision.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
in
some
cases,
they
do.
they
ask,
where
is
your
family?
do
you
have
a
preference
of
being
near
the
family?
are
you
close
to
your
family?
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
in
the
hypothetical
you
postulate
which
is
not
our
case
where
we
claim
separate
protection
interest,
it
is
factual
information
that
is
essential
before
the
prisoner
officials
exercise
the
discretion
that
i
would
concede
in
your
situation
that
they
have,
merely,
get
accurate
facts
before
you
exercise
discretion.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
in
every
instance
where
a
prisoner
will
suffer
injury
or
will
be
faced
with
more
adverse
consequences
as
a
result
of
these
conditions
of
confinement
as
the
court
discussed
in
footnote
19
in
wolfe
and
in
each
of
those
instances,
the
admittedly
discretionary
authority
of
the
corrections
officials
require
some
examination
into
the
facts.
the
kind
of
examination
might
be
very,
very
minimal
in
the
hypothetical
you
postulate.
it
should
be
much
more
serious
in
a
situation
such
as
the
ones
in
wolfe
where
a
person
was
going
to
lose
good
time
credits.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
there
is
four
or
five.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
there
is
some
very,
very
limited
interest,
the
kind
of
interest
that
mr.
justice
douglas
talked
about
in
his
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
wolfe.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
an
interest
flowing
from
the
core
value
of
the
liberty
concerns
of
the
due
process
clause
that
this
court
has
talked
on
occasion
where
there
is
injury
as
a
result
of
arbitrary
actions
of
the
administrator.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
a
wolfe
hearing
would
be
required
in
a
whole
range
of
decision
areas
or
decision
points.
certainly
at
the
initial
designation,
the
classification,
people
may
have
all
the
facts
before
they
need
from
his
pre
sentence
record,
from
his
probation
report
before
his
sentence?
if
they
have
those
facts
then
perhaps
merely
finding
out
where
his
family
is
or
if
he
has
any
particular
educational
or
vocational
aspirations
that
might
be
all
that
would
be
necessary.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
it
is
not
the
constitutional
right
to
be
near
their
family.
the
constitutional
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
pardon.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
can
the
state
stop
the
family
from
visiting?
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
think
not.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
it
is
now.
i
think
times
have
changed.
prisoners
in
jails
and
our
perceptions
about
them
are
different
now
than
they
were
many
years
ago.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
not
about
the
decision.
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
correct.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
it
is
not
on
this
case
and
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
the
appropriate
case,
there
might
be
some
appropriate
factual
inquiry
necessary.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
[sighs]
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
in
the
situation
where
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
conduct
it
arises
in
different
places
at
different
times.
in
our
case,
in
this
case,
the
case
being
before
this
court
as
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
decision
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
with
uncontroverted
allegations,
there
is
a
separate
liberty
interest
involved
at
least
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
that
liberty
interest
flowing
directly,
not
from
the
due
process
clause
originally,
but
from
the
first
or
sixth
amendment
which
triggered
the
implications
of
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
precisely
what
this
court
talked
about
in
perry
and
sindermann
where
they
said,
the
liberty
interest
in
due
process
would
be
irrelevant
if
a
person
were
being
punished
for
exercising
a
separate
constitutionally
protected
right,
a
right
flowing
from
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
right
it
is
a
substantive
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
right.
the
grievous
loss
only
goes
to
the
question
of
damages.
the
transfer
in
this
case
only
becomes
relevant
to
the
question
of
was
the
transfer
punishment
for
the
protected
activity
and
did
it
result
in
injury?
it
is
not
the
case
in
this
posture
whether
a
liberty
interests
flows
from
the
right
not
to
be
transferred
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
precisely
and
that
which
is
enough
on
the
complaint
in
terms
of
a
substantive
right
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
already
if
he
can
prove
it.
the
court
in
cooper
v.
pate
and
cruz
v.
beto
has
held
that
a
district
court
erroneously
dismissed
a
complaint
where
it
alleged
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
religious
freedom
act.
the
court
had
held
that
a
prisoner
retains,
pell
v.
procunier
his
first
amendment
rights
and
in
procunier
v.
martinez
the
court
struck
down
a
california
regulation
because
it
offended
the
constitution,
a
censorship
of
male
regulation
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
believe
under
what
this
court
said
in
wolfe
v.
mcdonald.
yes,
both
of
them
would
be
entitled
to
hearing.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
because
the
court
indicated
that
if
there
was
a
major
change
in
conditions
with
adverse
consequences
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
think
–
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
as
for
the
good
time,
yes.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
as
i
understand
the
new
york
regulations,
the
contrary
is
true.
they
have
this
rather
catch
22
situation.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
in
your
hypothesis,
not
being
transferred
for
misconduct
and
suffering
grievous
loss.
i
thought
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well
not.
i
do
not
think
it
requires
a
promise.
i
think
this
court
held
in
wolfe
that
the
interest
of
prisoners
in
these
proceedings,
is
included
and
rejected
the
state
of
nebraska’s
assertion
that
it
was
not
included
in
the
liberty
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
but
the
court
also
dealt
with
solitary
and
indicated
that
solitary
represented
a
major
change
in
the
conditions
of
confinement,
and
therefore,
triggered
the
implications
of
the
due
process.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
i
thought
that
was
your
hypothesis
that
a
rule
was
breached
and
that
then
–-
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
i
misunderstood
you.
what
my
position
is
that
you
do
not
need
a
state
rule
saying
we
will
not
do
something
in
order
to
trigger
the
liberty
interest
--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
with
all
due
respect,
that
is
the
way
i
read
mcdonald
and
particularly
the
–-
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
because
ours
is
a
different
case
dealing
with
the
specific
conduct
of
the
prisoner
as
i
indicated
which
i
think
flows
directly
from
the
reading
of
his
complaint.
i
think
our
case
is
precisely
what
the
court
said
in
procunier
and
martinez
that
the
interest
of
prisoners
and
in
the
sense
of
communication.
in
this
case,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
ground
in
the
first
amendment
is
plainly
a
liberty
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
and
as
such
as
protected
from
arbitrary
governmental
intrusion.
similarly,
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
are
protected
by
a
johnson
and
avery,
procunier
v.
martinez
and
i
think
that
all
the
district
court
did
hear
was
to
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss.
all
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
say
that
there
is
a
colorable
claim
in
this
complaint.
they
remanded
to
the
district
court.
it
did
not
reach
the
merits.
i
think
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
the
taking
of
proof
on
those
three
issues.
the
nature
of
this
conduct
was
a
punish
by
transfer
and
that
he
suffered
loss
as
result
of
that.
