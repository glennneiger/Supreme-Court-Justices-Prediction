chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-520,
montanye
and
others
against
haymes.
mr.
lewittes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
the
combination
of
your
responses
means
that
if
in
fact
and
in
reality,
the
move
or
the
transfer
inflicts
no
harm
or
injury
that
then
there
is
no
legal
consequence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
need
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
a
punitive,
to
pursue
what
we
have
been
talking
about,
a
punitive
shift
from
the
12
o’clock
lunch
assignment
to
the
1
o’clock
assignment
and
then
explicitly
stated
as
such
to
the
prisoner
is
--
violates
no
interest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
conceded,
we
can
concede
for
the
moment
that
the
loss
of
the
injury
will
be
de
minimis
in
traditional
terms,
but
what
about
the
idea
that
something
will
be
done
to
the
prisoner
if
he
writes
a
letter
to
his
lawyer,
some
sort
of
the
psychological
impact
is
bound
to
occur
on
him,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
that
would
be
the
purpose
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
sometimes
people
who
think
they
are
not
permitted
to
do
and
then
we
have
the
case,
that
is
what
we
are
confronted
with
sometimes,
but
surely
you
cannot
--
you
do
not
need
to
say
it,
do
you,
that
the
city
of
new
york
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
lunch
hour
and
tell
him
that
this
is
a
disciplinary
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bronstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bronstein,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
he
was
moved
from
a
maximum
security
prison
400
miles
from
his
home
base
to
one
10
miles
from
his
home
base
or
the
reverse
of
that
proposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
right
would
be
the
same
in
your
submission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
sentenced
to
the
custody
of
the
correction
authority
in
new
york,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
administratively,
he
is
then
assigned
to
an
institution,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
suppose
they
advise
him
or
he
learns
that
he
is
going
to
be
sent
to
attica
and
he
says
now
attica
has
a
terrible
history
and
that
it
is
a
dangerous
place
and
i
want
to
go
somewhere
else
and
i
want
a
hearing,
is
he
entitled
to
the
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
were
kind
of
sort
out
what
is
here
and
i
find
great
difficulty
so
far?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
the
convicted
person's
opinion
as
to
where
he
ought
to
be
assigned,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
getting
factual
information
not
an
expression
of
desires?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
they
have
to
get
any
facts?
i
suppose
the
prison
authority
simply
has
a
rotation
and
right
in
straight
rotation.
all
people
assigned
to
maximum
security
prisoners
are,
if
they
have
three
of
them,
every
third
man
goes
to
one
of
them.
there
is
no
consultation,
no
inquiry,
no
hearing.
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
some
property
or
liberty
interest
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assume
--
you
get
how
many
maximum
security
prisons
do
you
have
in
new
york,
do
you
know?
let
us
assume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright
there
are
four.
he
is
assigned
to
one
that
400
miles
away
from
his
home
and
he
demands
a
hearing
and
says
he
wants
to
be
at
one
nearest
to
his
home.
do
you
have
a
property
or
liberty
interest
or
any
kind
of
an
interest
on
where
is
to
be
assigned
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
solely,
protected
interest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
beginning
to
see
when
this
rights
or
property
interest
that
you
are
getting
comes
into
being,
so
i
wanted
to
see
whether
you
thought
he
gets
it
by
virtue
of
the
sentence,
the
judgment
of
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
lewittes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-520,
montanye
against
haymes,
and
75-252,
meachum
against
fano
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.

justice

you,
