justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
because
of
the
issue
raised
by
the
confiscation
of
the
petition?
is
that
why
you
say
they
treated
it
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
you
think
they
could
tell
an
inmate
that
if
you
filed
a
petition
in
court,
he
would
be
moved
to
another
cell?
would
that
be
appropriate
treatment
in
response
to
his
exercising
a
right
to
his
lawyer
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the
rule
which
said
to
prisoners,
if
you
write
to
lawyer
you
will
go
to
cell
block
a
instead
of
cell
block
c?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
a
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
there
a
liberty
interest
in
not
being
treated
differently
because
of
the
fact
that
you
file
petitions
or
write
letters
to
lawyers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
put
the
question
one
differently
and
then
i
will
abandon
it.
do
you
think
in
the
disposition
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
this
case,
any
particular
significance
was
attached
to
the
manner
in
which
the
whole
incident
of
arose?
now,
did
it
affect
that
it
grew
up
of
the
alleged
confiscation
of
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
it
that
two
days
before
the
transfer
there
was
allegedly
a
confiscation
of
a
paper
that
he
had
been
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
important
do
you
think
that
background
is
in
the
court
of
appeals'
disposition
of
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
should
it
have
been
important?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
one
find
out
without
a
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
you
are
saying
that
there
should
be
a
trial
of
that
issue
or
is
it
--?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is,
just
so
i
have
it
right,
that
even
if
he
was
transferred
because
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
lawyer
saying
that
that
would
be
a
permissible
transfer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
indicate
mr.
bronstein
that
really
the
theory
you
are
advancing
now
is
not
a
procedural
due
process
theory
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
do
not
really
have
to
find
the
grievous
loss
or
any
of
that
and
even
if
you
were
given
a
hearing,
you
would
still
have
a
claim
under
the
theory
you
now
describing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
you
are
not
talking
about
the
causal
connection,
fact
of
damage
and
amount
of
damage,
you
are
not
talking
about
the
source
of
the
right
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
own
limit
point
i
take
it
is
that
there
is
enough
in
the
complaint
to
require
a
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
in
the
very
last
paragraph
of
his
complaint
petition
on
page
6(a)
of
the,
that
is
before
the
conclusion
of
the
appendix,
he
does
alleged
that
he
was
removed
from
his
job
assignment,
that
the
petition
was
confiscated,
all
his
direct
result
of
administration
reprisals
against
your
petitioner
for
assisting
those
inmates
contained
in
civil
action
no.
so
and
so
for
assisting
attica
inmate
number
martinez
in
another
petition
and
for
also
for
circulating
the
petition.
does
that
not
give
him
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
just
the
82
signatories,
he
is
suing
on
behalf.
he
is
suing
on
behalf
of
himself
as
i
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
what
i
read?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
does
not
say
he
has
been
denied
access
to
the
courts.
as
i
read
it,
he
says
that
he
was
transferred
because
he
rendered
legal
assistance
to
other
inmates,
that
is
what
he
says?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
is
a
matter
of
defense,
is
it
not?
that
is
exactly
the
point
your
opponent
makes
and
i
agree
with
you,
he
changed
his
theory
from
his
brief,
but
do
you
not
have
to
meet
that
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
satisfied
to
say
that
if
a
man
can
be
disciplined
for
assisting
other
inmates
with
legal
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can
be
transferred
for
that
reason?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
in
order
