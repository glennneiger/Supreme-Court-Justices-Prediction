justice
potter
stewart
of
the
assistant
to
the
warden
or
the
prisoners
who
had
been
depending
upon
him
for
legal
assistance,
how
did
you
understand?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
not
think
that
the
program
on
which
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
their
opinion
was
based
on
denial
of
procedural
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
not
being
given
sufficient
notice
and
hearing
and
then
wherever
else
might
be
required
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
its
procedural
aspects,
is
that
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
last
part?
