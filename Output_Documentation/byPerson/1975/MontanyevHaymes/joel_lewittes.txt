mr.
joel
lewittes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
today
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
requires
that
an
inmate
who
was
transferred
within
a
state
from
one
maximum
security
facility
to
another
maximum
security
facility
with
no
imposition
of
disciplinary
penalties
before
the
notice
of
the
reasons
for
the
transfer
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
underlying
facts
are
as
follows.
the
respondent
haymes
was
incarcerated
at
attica
correctional
facility
in
august
of
1971,
attica
being
a
maximum
security
facility.
his
conviction
was
for
manslaughter
in
the
first
degree.
attica
is
one
of
six
maximum
security
facilities
in
the
state
of
new
york.
on
june
9,
1972,
the
respondent
haymes
was
transferred
from
attica
to
clinton
which
is
another
maximum
security
facility.
two
days
earlier,
prison
officials
at
attica
had
confiscated
and
seized
from
haymes
a
petition
he
was
circulating
on
behalf
of
other
inmates.
this
document
denominated
by
the
respondent
to
be
a
petition
was
addressed
to
the
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
new
york
and
entered
a
claim
that
the
discharge
of
haymes
on
that
very
day
as
a
law
assistant
in
the
law
library
at
the
attica
facility
had
already
deprived
82
signatories
of
that
petition
of
legal
assistance.
in
addition
to
that,
the
petition
also
complained
of
eight
various
attitudes
of
the
correctional
officers
in-charge
of
the
law
library.
a
few
weeks
later
at
the
clinton
facility,
haymes
filed
a
pro
se
complaint,
returnable
in
the
western
district
of
new
york
against
various
attica
officials
and
he
raised
two
claims
in
that
complaint.
number
one,
he
claimed
that
the
confiscation
of
the
petition
was
entitled
to
damages
for
that
in
the
amount
of
$1,500.00
compensatory
damages
and
his
second
claim
was
various
acts
of
retaliation,
including
the
transfer,
had
been
taken
against
him
and
he
sought
$1,500.00
punitive
damages.
with
regard
to
the
general
claim
of
retaliation,
only
one
aspect
was
pursued
by
counsel
in
the
district
court
and
that
was
the
issue
of
transfer.
in
the
district
court,
the
court
held
that
with
regard
to
the
transfer
issue
it
was
dismissible
and
they
did
dismiss
it,
holding
that
even
though
it
was
alleged
that
the
transfer
was
punishment,
there
was
no
allegation
of
harsher
or
substantially
different
treatments
since
he
was
transferred
from
one
maximum
security
facility
to
another
maximum
security
facility.
however,
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
chief
judge
kaufman
pointed
out
that
simply
all
an
inmate
has
to
do
was
to
claim
or
allege
that
the
transfer
was
a
punishment
and
that
would
entitle
him
to
his
day
in
court,
where
he
could
prove
the
transfer
was
punitively
motivated
and
that
the
consequences
were
onerous
to
him.
the
court
did
not
in
any
way
analyze
the
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
indeed
an
underlined
liberty
or
property
interest
involved.
the
court
simply
defined
punishment
as
harsh
treatment
meted
out
to
reform,
to
deter,
or
reprimand
and
suggested
various
consequences
that
flow
from
the
transfer
itself.
number
one,
there
was
a
claim,
a
hypothetical
claim
i
should
say,
that
was
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
that
he
will
be
removed
from
his
family.
the
clinton
facility
is
several
hundred
miles
away
from
the
attica
facility
from
which
he
was
transferred?
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
it
certainly
could
have
been.
he
could
have
been
obviously
been
placed
in
the
clinton
facility
initially,
at
which
point
he
would
have
been
350
miles
so
away
from
his
family.
the
court,
that
is
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
also
suggested
that
he
suffered
grievous
loss
in
the
sense
that
he
would
be
removed
from
his
friends
in
the
prison.
the
other
suggestion
was
that
there
could
possibly
be
a
loss
of
property
during
the
time
of
the
transfer.
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
would
seem
that
under
the
rational
of
the
second
circuit,
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
say
they
have
treated
it
the
same
way
because
the
court
without
analyzing
whether
or
not
there
was
a
property
interest
or
a
liberty
interest
said
that
so
long
as
the
inmate
subjectively
feels
that
there
was
punishment
involved,
he
is
entitled
to
his
day
in
court.
it
is
clear
in
the
hypothetical
suggested
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
a
movement
from
one
cell
to
another
cell
may
be
subjectively
on
the
mind
of
an
inmate
punishment,
and
therefore,
would
be
entitled
to
his
day
in
court
and
he
may
even
claim
grievous
loss
and
that
his
cell
is
not
close
to
friends
of
his
cell
by
reason
of
the
movement
to
another
cell.
so
that
was
the
reason
for
my
affirmative
answer.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
he
could
be
moved
from
any
cell
within
the
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
now,
if
we
indeed
are
talking
about
a
rule
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
--
or
a
practice,
then
it
is
possible
it
can
be
claimed
at
least
that
by
virtue
of
this
particular
rule
or
regulation,
he
had
an
expectation
that
he
would
remain
in
that
cell
and
it
might
be
possible
that
it
could
be
argued
that
there
was
perhaps
created
some
sort
of
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
liberty
interest
that
may
be
involved
here.
treating
differently
may
implicate
an
equal
protection
claim.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
hear
the
last
part.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
in
their
view
it
is
important.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
not.
number
one,
it
is
not
very
clear
at
all
whether
that
was
the
fact
that
actually
triggered
the
transfer
in
the
first
place.
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
do
not
have
a
record
here.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
say
there
should
be
a
trial
because
the
answer
to
that
is
that
even
if
he
was
transferred
for
that
reason,
there
was
no
property
of
liberty
interest
involved.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
i
would.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
he
could
then
proceed
in
a
plenary
action
under
1983,
claiming
that
he
was
denied
of
his
access.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
what
i
am
saying,
i
am
saying
more
than
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
saying
that
before
you
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
the
grievous
loss
where
there
is
indeed
injury
because
injury
goes
to
the
weight
and
not
to
the
nature,
you
must
first
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
liberty
of
property
interest
to
be
protected
in
the
first
place.
once
it
is
determined
there
is
indeed
such
an
interest,
then
we
go
to
see
the
weight
of
that
interest
and
whether
there
is
indeed
grievous
loss.
i
think
that
using
grievous
loss
first
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
say
it
violates
no
interest
and
if
there
were
any
lawsuit
it
would
be
de
minimis.
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
i
think
that
is
true
however
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
however,
the
fact
is
that
transfer
is
never
used
and
is
not
permitted
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
be
use
as
disciplinary
method.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
i
do
not.
i
hope
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
the
real
answer
in
this
particular
case,
if
i
may
say
so,
is
that
this
petition
by
the
way
was
not
a
petition
by
the
respondent
haymes
by
any
means
claiming
that
he
was
not,
that
he
was
denied
access
to
the
courts.
it
was
a
letter
written
by
haymes
on
behalf
of
82
signatories
who
were
not
before
the
district
court,
and
therefore,
mr.
haymes
would
have
no
standing
in
any
event
to
raise
that
issue.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
did
say
that.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do.
mr.
joel
lewittes
there
was
no
interference
here
at
all
with
his
fight
to
go
to
court
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no.
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
would
seem
yes
i
said
that
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
the
petition
that
was
drawn
by
him
on
behalf
of
the
82
signatories.
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
that
is
not
at
all.
what
the
petition
was
about
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
the
petition
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
to
make
the
statement
more
accurate,
the
petition
read
that
since
mr.
haymes
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes,
at
page
13(a)
to
the
appendix.
now
13(a)
reads
mr.
justice
marshall,
“i
am
writing
to
complain
that
i
am
now
being
deprived
of
legal
assistance
as
a
result
of
inmate
rodney
r.
haymes
and
john
washington
being
removed
from
the
prison
law
library.”
it
did
not
say
that
they
were
being
denied
access
to
the
courts,
but
they
just
quoted
these
two
specific
people
to
be
on
the
law
library,
that
is
basically
their
claim.
mr.
joel
lewittes
they
are
claiming
that
these
two
gentlemen,
that
the
removal
of
these
two
gentlemen
from
the
law
library
somehow
deprives
them
of
legal
assistance
that
the
assumption
being
that
only
rodney
haymes
and
mr.
john
washington
could
assist
them
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
assuming
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
think
they
are.
i
think
that
they
are
claiming
that
they
are
unhappy
about
the
discharge
of
rodney
haymes,
but
in
any
event
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
fact
is
that
that
may
be
a
complaint,
may
be
a
complaint
that
could
be
presented
in
a
1983
action
by
any
of
the
82
signatories,
but
mr.
rodney
haymes
was
not
a
signatory
to
that
and
mr.
rodney
haymes
is
not
claiming
in
any
matter
that
he
was
denied
access
to
the
court.
mr.
joel
lewittes
pardon.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
they
could
claim
it.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
i
happen
to
feel
that
simply
because
mr.
rodney
haymes
and
his
fellow
were
removed
from
the
law
library
does
not
present
a
cause
of
action,
claiming
denial
of
access
whether
they
want
to
put
on
a
complaint
that
these
inmates
do
that.
they
may
raise
any
kind
of
contention,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
viable
contention.
despite
the
patent
failure,
it
seems
to
petition
out
of
the
second
circuit
to
first
analyze
the
facts
first
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
liberty
of
property
interest
is
involved.
both
parties
here
do
apparently
agree
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
implicated
unless
haymes
can
establish
a
liberty
or
property
interest
at
a
particular
maximum
security
prison.
now,
he
does
not
in
any
matter
allege
a
property
interest
since
by
statute
which
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
the
power
to
transfer
is
discretionary.
rather
haymes
attempts
to
construct
an
independent
liberty
interest
in
his
retention
at
attica
and
he
points
to
those
various
hypothetical
situations
raised
in
the
second
circuit
opinion.
it
is
noteworthy,
however,
that
respondent
haymes
does
not
allege
in
any
manner
that
he
suffered
any
of
those
hypothetical
consequences.
the
motive
which
chief
judge
kaufman
referred
to
in
the
second
circuit,
claiming
the
motive
was
punishment
here,
we
think
is
not
relevant
at
this
point
because
what
mr.
haymes
perceives
as
punishment
as
perhaps
with
mr.
roth,
in
the
roth
case
perceived
as
grievous
loss.
it
does
not
independently
establish
a
property
or
liberty
interest
and
without
this
property
or
liberty
interest,
the
motive
nor
the
results
can
be
denominated
as
disciplinary
and
it
does
not
implicate
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
understood
as
assistant
to
the
warden.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct
because
by
virtue
of
certain
rules
and
regulations,
it
is
determined
that
is
a
punishment
and
denominated
as
a
punishment
and
there
is
no
expectation
when
one
goes
to
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
the
expectation
would
be
that
one
would
normally
stay
in
the
general
population.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
correct.
unless
there
is
a
material
change
in
the
terms
of
your
confinement,
you
would
have
the
expectation
that
you
will
remain
in
general
population.
mr.
joel
lewittes
that
is
absolutely
correct.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
may
have.
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
is
clear
that
the
respondent
has
completely
turned
course
here.
the
issues
he
now
raises
were
raised
in
only
footnote
20
to
his
brief
on
page
20.
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
rodney
haymes,
although
he
alleged
civil
claims
of
retaliation
in
his
petition,
only
one
aspect
has
been
pursued
both
in
the
district
court
and
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
have
to
do
with
the
procedural
due
process
issue
whether
he
was
entitled
a
notice
of
hearing
and
not
a
claim
that
is
claimed
today
that
he
was
transferred
for
a
prohibitive
reason
that
is
the
first
or
sixth
amendment
right.
in
any
event,
it
is
clear
from
the
petition
itself
that
he
has
no
claims
here.
there
is
no
standing
on
his
part
to
raise
these
issues.
he
did
not.
all
he
did
was
put
that
petition
on
behalf
of
82
signatories.
he
does
not
claim
in
any
manner
that
he
was
denied
access
of
the
court.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
the
–-
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
found
later
in
his
affidavit
which
in
essence
was
his
amended
complaint
on
page
19(a)
of
the
appendix,
where
he
says
he
was
finally
shifted
from
attica
to
clinton
in
obvious
conspiracy
attempt
to
separate
this
plaintiff
from
the
other
inmates
who
were
also
petitioning
the
court
for
readdress
concerning
the
inmates'
legal
assistance,
all
of
which
were
direct
facts
of
reprisal
by
that
--
in
respondents
against
your
plaintiff
for
attempting
to
exercise
his
own
constitution
rights
and
attempting
to
assist
other
inmates
for
securing
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
does
seem
to
say
that
yes
sir,
but
it
is
clear
to
me
that
the
petition
itself,
looking
at
the
petition
itself,
the
body
of
the
petition
indicates
clearly
that
it
was
on
behalf
of
the
signatories
who
were
complaining
that
mr.
rodney
haymes
had
been
indeed
removed
from
the
position
of
law
clerk
and
not
that
rodney
haymes
by
the
way
had
in
any
manner
had
been
denied
access
to
the
courts
because
his
complaint
would
not
have
been
on
the
district
court
in
the
first
place
had
he
been
denied
access
to
the
court.
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
must
not
forget
that
there
was
a
rule
involved
here.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
think
that
–
mr.
joel
lewittes
yes.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
am
not
admitting
there
was
any
discipline
here.
mr.
joel
lewittes
he
can
be
transferred
for
any
reason.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
seem
to
have.
mr.
joel
lewittes
well,
it
is
not
really
a
pro
se
job
because
seven
months
before
the
decision
in
the
district
court
this
petitioner
had
counsel,
retained
counsel
who
never
raised
these
issues
by
the
way
in
the
district
court.
so
it
is
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
was
pro
se
petition
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
the
fact
is
that
he
did
retain
counsel
who
did
submit
seven
months
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
western
district
a
memorandum
on
behalf
of
himself.

i
cannot
really
say
it
is
pro
se.
mr.
joel
lewittes
it
is
an
allegation,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
no,
we
do
not.
we
only
have
--
mr.
joel
lewittes
we
have
to
give
the
allegations
a
fact
of
full
force,
but
not
the
conclusions
of
law
necessarily
that
flow
there
from.
mr.
joel
lewittes
i
do
not
think
that
he
has
stated
a
claim
and
he
has
just
stated
a
dismissible
claim
and
there
is
no
reason
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
again.
he
has
not
stated
the
cause
of
action.
