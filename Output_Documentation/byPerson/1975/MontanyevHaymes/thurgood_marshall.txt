justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
see
any
interference
with
his
right
to
go
to
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
petition
he
drew
himself
and
had
the
other
82
to
sign
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
charge
that
the
librarian
prevented
them
from
getting
access
to
the
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
object
to
denial
of
materials
to
access
to
the
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
chief
judge
kaufman's
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
document
charged,
well,
you
just
wait,
let
me
just
read
this,
the
document
charged
that
the
library
officer
edward
brady
went,
“out
of
his
way
to
circumvent
in
inmates'
legal
assistance.”
is
judge
kaufman
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
not
read
what
you
give
value
here
because
i
read
what
was
written
down
here.
now,
read
me
what
the
petition
says,
if
you
want
to
contradict
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
that
it
could
be
better
done
and
better
worded,
but
at
least
they
are
saying
that
they
will
be
denied
the
right
to
get
the
assistance,
legal
assistance,
they
are
charging
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
agree
that
the
other
82
would?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
that
the
other
82
would
ever
cause
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
right
to
be
near
his
family?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
state
stop
their
family
from
visiting
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
place
where
they
might
get
visitors,
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
the
state
set
up
a
prisoner
with
no
visitors?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
case
being?
justice
thurgood
marshall
originally
they
used
to
--
the
judge
used
to
pick
the
jail,
he
went
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
any
ceremony,
any
concepts,
or
any
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
never
questioned,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
not
true
that
leaving
new
york,
you
can
go
to
texas.
you
can
take
a
man
from
galveston,
texas
and
put
him
into
jail
in
el
paso.
there
is
not
a
thing
in
the
world
you
can
do
it
about
it
legally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
original
job
assignment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
argument
that
there
is
anything
on
the
original
side?
why
take
on
that
extra
weight?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
why
do
you
not
say
rather
that
they
can
do
it
originally,
but
they
cannot
do
it
afterwards?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
a
application,
they
need
to
get
lawyer
to
judge
--
for
judgment,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
in
the
last
full
paragraph,
keeping
your
plaintiff
along
with
others
from
submitting
this
petition
to
this
very
court
for
the
readdress
of
grievances
is
there
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
20(a)
justice
thurgood
marshall
pro
se
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
pro
se
petition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
assume
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
this
was
the
best
lawyer
in
the
state
and
dean
of
all
of
law
schools,
is
this
enough
to
show
that
he
alleges
he
was
denied
the
right
to
petition
the
court
for
readdress
of
grievance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
we
have
anything
before
us
other
than
allegations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
we
have
to
give
those
allegations
a
full
force?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
--
there
is
no
conclusion
of
law
here.
why
do
you
not
want
a
hearing
on
this
in
the
district
court?
what
is
wrong
with
that?
