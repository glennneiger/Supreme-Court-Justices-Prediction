mr.
donald
smaltz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
case
comes
to
this
court
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
of
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
case
involves
petitioners
conviction
for
violations
of
the
male
fraud
statute
18
u.s.c.
1341.
the
indictment
charge
that
the
petitioner
mr.
goldberg
and
edwin
s.
newman
and
three
other
quote
defendants
had
violated
the
statute
in
connection
with
the
issue
on
sub
single
premium
annuity
policies
to
various
individual
annuities
who
in
term
pledged
those
annuities
as
collateral
for
existing
or
for
new
loans
with
various
lenders.
the
annuities
were
issued
from
a
life
insurance
company
located
in
phoenix,
arizona
known
as
financial
security
life
insurance
company,
sometimes
referred
to
in
the
brief
that
as
fsl.
the
indictment
charge
that
the
defendant
and
his
codefendants
made
false
statements
to
the
lenders
who
considered
making
loans
or
who
made
loans
in
the
policies.
all
of
the
defendants
with
the
exception
of
petitioner
and
newman
pleaded
guilty
to
one
of
more
counts
prior
to
petitioner's
trial.
petitioner
went,
his
case
went
to
trial
by
itself
and
he
was
found
guilty
of
14
counts
of
the
indictment
and
sentenced
to
two
years
in
prison.
on
each
of
the
count
said
the
sentence
to
run
concurrently
and
fine
$1,000
per
count.
following
petitioners
conviction,
newman
whose
case
was
severed
about
a
week
before
petitioner's
case
was
scheduled
for
trial
and
the
indictment
against
newman
was
dismissed
and
he
was
permitted
to
plead
guilty
to
two
misdemeanors.
the
issue
on
which
the
writ
was
granted
was
whether
the
jencks
act
contains
an
attorney's
work
product
exception
and
whether
the
government
attorneys
notes
of
conversation
would
keep
government
witnesses
to
whom
the
prosecutors
have
read
back
their
notes
from
time
to
time,
whether
witness
would
correct
the
prosecutors
notes
from
time
to
time,
if
not
compellable
under
the
terms
of
the
jencks
act
are
compellable
under
the
greedy
doctrine.
subsequent
to
this
court's
granting
of
the
petition,
united
states
conceded
for
the
first
time
that
certain
of
the
notes
contain
in
a
packet
of
notes
which
was
personalized
in
the
court
of
appeal
on
august
12,
1974
at
the
time
of
argument,
oral
argument
that
certain
of
these
notes
were
in
fact
not
the
notes
of
the
prosecutors
as
has
been
represented
all
the
way
of
the
line
but
in
fact
were
the
handwritten
notes
of
the
witness
newman.
mr.
donald
smaltz
no
sir
and
i
am
going
to
get
to
that.
it
was
not
set
out
petition
for
certiorari
because
it
was
a
fact
unknown
to
petitioner
at
the
time
he
found
his
petition
and
the
government
did
not
make
the
disclosure
until
shortly
before
the
petitioner
filed
his
opening
brief
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
smaltz
in
quantity
your
honor,
out
of
237
pages
40
pages
are
newman's
handwriting.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
are
written
in
primary
in
the
handwriting
of
mr.
lebowitz
and
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
he
was
the
attorney
for
the
government,
yes
sir,
he
was
one
of
two
court
attorneys
and
the
other
prosecutors
name
was
keilp.
primarily
most
of
the
notes
are
in
mr.
lebowitz's
handwriting.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
they
are,
now
the
government
has
contended
that
in
its
reply
in
its
brief
that
because
the
court
did
not
grant
the
writ
as
to
the
notes
in
newman’s
handwriting
that
we
petitioners
foreclose
from
discussing
this
matter.
however
it
is
petitioners
contention
that
the
matter
is
properly
before
the
court,
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
brady
argument
made
in
the
application
for
the
writ
subsumes
the
issue
of
evidence
to
favorable
to
the
defendant
and
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
i
am
not
saying
that
all
brady
materials
are
necessary
to
jencks
materials
or
all
the
jencks
materials
are
necessary
to
brady
materials
but
there
is
an
area
there
were
they
overlap
and
if
the
government
fails
to
produce
upon
timely
demand,
materials
in
its
possession
which
will
impeach
its
key
witness
if
all
they
were
in
gender,
a
violation
of
jencks
i
submit
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
they
can
also
in
gender
a
violation
of
brady.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
in
palermo
vs.
united
states
and
the
concurrent
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
he
indicated
that
the
commence
of
the
constitution
were
closed
to
the
surface
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
jencks
versus
united
states.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
think
that
mr.
justice
douglas
in
augenblick
indicated
that
the
commence
of
the
sixth
amendment
are
closed
to
surface
of
the
jencks
act.
i
believe
that
a
number
of
lower
courts
one
of
them
being
johnson
versus
johnson
have
indicated
that
the
jencks
act
embodies
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
as
an
issue
that
we
doubt
with
some
rank
in
our
brief.
secondly,
second
reason
why
this
court
can
consider
the
issue
of
newman’s
no
handwritten
notes,
is
that
the
document
plain
error
enables
the
court
to
consider
it
and
since
it
was
the
government's
failure
to
disclose
this
material
both
to
the
trial
court
and
to
the
ninth
circuit,
petitioner
cannot
be
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
not
knowing
of
these
matters,
because
he
was
not
furnished
the
fact
that
these
notes
until
august
of
1975
when
solicitor
generals
office
for
the
first
time
provided
him
with
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
your
honor
i
thought
that
the
plain
error
doctrine
is
a
doctrine
that
is
used
only
in
extraordinary
circumstances
but
when
some
act
or
some
error
exists
which
substantially
affects
defendant's
integrity
or
probable
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings,
i
believe
that
is
an
accepted
definition
of
when
the
plain
error
doctrine
will
apply
and
that
be
in
the
case
i
submit
that
the
government
is
further
to
disclose
the
true
character
of
the,
of
what
was
in
its
possession
rises
that
to
the
level
of
plain
error.
mr.
donald
smaltz
your
honor,
it
was
handed
to
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
time
of
oral
argument.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
i
was
there.
mr.
donald
smaltz
no,
we
did
not
received
copies
your
honor,
or
inspect
the
copies
of
these
notes
until
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
granted
and
that
we
received
those
copies
in
august
of
1975,
what
had
happened
was
this
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
the
court
below,
in
the
trial
court
and
initially
in
its
brief
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
government
contended
that
the
notes
relating
to
newman,
their
handwritten
notes
of
their
conversation
with
him
had
in
fact
been
delivered
to
the
trial
judge
for
an
in
camera
inspection,
they
said
so
in
their
appellant
brief
to
the
circuit.
we
had
taken
the
position
that
the
trial
court
had
never
made
an
inspection,
that
was
one
of
our
complains
to
the
circuit
and
(inaudible)
the
government
admitted
its
error
and
they
admitted
it
at
the
time
of
oral
argument
when
the
prosecutor
stood
up
and
requested
permission
from
the
court
to
file
the
packet
of
notes
and
he
said
these
are
all
the
notes
that
i
can
now
locate.
now,
there
is
a
factual
dispute
about
that
and
i
understand
that
the
government
has
filed
an
affidavit
of
the
prosecutor
mr.
lebowitz
who
have
vows
to
this
court
and
in
essence
what
he
told
the
circuit
was
that
these
are
all
the
notes.
we
have
filed
a
contrary
affidavit
which
is
an
exhibit
to
our
reply
brief.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well
i
would
think
not
your
honor
but
since
the
government
has
asked,
has
lied
to
this
notes
and
other
materials
which
were
not
part
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
stated
that
the
notes
that
had
been
--
the
notes
of
the
prosecutors,
i
will
give
you
with
the
precise
language.
mr.
donald
smaltz
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
they
were
work
papers,
that
the
court
said
this
the
circuit
court.
apart
from
the
question
whether
such
notes
were
exempt
from
the
jencks
act
as
work
product,
they
were
not
statements
of
the
defendant
within
the
meaning
of
3500e,
we
find
no
clear
prejudicial
error,
that
is
found
at
appendix
120.
i
have
--
the
court
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
they
examined
the
notes
if
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
but
i
have
some
doubt
as
to
where
they
could
make
a
meaningful
examination
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
when
the
government
launched
this
237
page
packet,
the
notes
are
intersperse,
there
is
no
pagination
to
the
notes.
there
is
no
chronological
order
to
the
notes,
there
was
no
explanation
by
the
government
as
to
who
wrote
what
at
the
time
it
were
filed.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
because
solicitor
general
said
that
they
were
going
to
order
up,
they
were
going
to
file
these
notes
with
this
court
and
also
they
were
going
to
file
other
materials
which
were
not
part
of
record
with
this
court.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
i
was.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
would
like
to
view
as
a
concession
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
the
government
so
regarded
it
as
it
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
at
the
time
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
donald
smaltz
and
at
the
time
that
the
notes
were
filed
in
the
appellate
court,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
government
did
not
provide
me
a
copy.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
got
them
your
owner
as
we
were
putting
our
finishing
touches
on
our
opening
brief,
and
i
will
take
anything
i
can
get
from
the
government
so
i
did.
mr.
donald
smaltz
no
i
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
donald
smaltz
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
case
on
april
3,
1975.
we
did
not
receive
the
notes
until
sometime
in
the
second
week
of
august
1975.
in
our
reply
brief
that
was
filed
on
behalf
of
petitioner
at
pages
16
and
17,
there
is
a
chart
which
we
have
prepared
and
it
is
printed
in
the
brief
which
summarizes
the
various
stages
of
what
occurred
with
regard
to
these
notes
and
the
positions
taken
by
the
government.
the
position
is
very
depending
upon
the
court
involved.
in
fact
the
solicitor
general
and
found
his
response
or
his
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
never
even
handed
that
any
of
the
notes
that
were
lodged
with
the
ninth
circuit
and
which
were
it
issue
in
this
case
were
in
fact
authored
by
newsman.
so
in
essence
we
had
two
different
sets
of
notes
those
prepared
by
prosecutors
and
those
prepared
by
the
witness
himself.
now,
this
case
presents
an
unusual,
jencks
act
case
in
the
sense
that
the
petitioner
that
the
mr.
newman
who
was
the
key
witness
against
the
petitioner
was
required
by
virtue
of
a
contract
he
entered
into
with
the
government
to
make
a
full
and
complete
statement.
newman
was
codefendant
in
the
scheme
charged.
immediately
prior
to
trial,
he
entered
into
a
written
deal
with
the
government.
the
plea
agreement
appears
in
the
appendix
at
pages
48
to
50
under
the
terms
of
paragraph
one
of
the
agreement
newman
was
to
give
a
complete
statement
under
oath
concerning
those
events
which
were
alleged
in
the
indictment.
under
paragraph
3a
of
that
agreement
and
the
government
agree
the
sever
newman.
and
newman
agreed
to
testify
this
for
the
government
said
testimony
being
in
conformity
with
the
statement
having
being
given
to
the
united
states
attorney
under
oath
before
trial.
further
that
in
the
event,
newman
failed
to
honor
the
terms
of
his
plea
agreement
with
the
government,
that
the
government
would
use
his
pretrial
statement
under
oath
as
well
as
his
testimony
at
the
trial
petitioner
against
newman
in
a
subsequent
trial.
the
agreement
also
provided
that
if
petitioner's
case
went
to
trial,
newman
would
plead
guilty
to
a
felony
but
if
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
then
newman
will
be
permitted
to
plead
to
two
misdemeanors
and
in
both
instances
the
government
would
recommend
probation.
mr.
donald
smaltz
your
honor
that
is
at
pages
48
to
50
the
precise
page
is
48
and
49,
let
us
turn
out
mr.
newman
was
the
35th
and
last
witness
called
by
the
government
and
its
case
in
chief.
he
was
also
the
so
rebuttal
witness.
newman
purported
to
testify
in
direct
examination,
practically
in
his
verbose
to
91
conversations,
he
allegedly
had
with
petitioner
which
in
turn
linked
petitioner
to
the
illegal
scheme
and
allegedly
demonstrated
petitioner's
knowledge
in
center.
newman’s
testimony
on
direct
examination
lasted
three
days
and
spend
440
pages,
he
was
the
key
to
the
government's
case,
the
fact
even
the
solicitor
general
office
acknowledges
and
he
had
work
with
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
has
various
insurance
companies
for
over
a
decade,
newman
was
a
lawyer
and
he
was
a
signatory
to
all
of
the
correspondence
which
emanated
from
financial
security
life
insurance
company
to
the
lenders
and
all
the
two
of
the
count
mailings
from
the
insurance
company
were
executed
and/or
sent
by
newsman.
it
was
newman
who
after
consulting
a
phoenix
attorney
provided
the
formal
responses
to
the
lenders
which
were
utilized
by
fsl
and
which
automatically
resided
in
petitioner's
indictment.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
judge
as
well
as
the
prosecutor
described
the
correspondence
which
emanated
from
newman
as
the
crux
of
the
government's
case.
now
under
the
very
same
day,
that
this
plea
argument
agreement
is
dated
between
newman
and
the
government,
which
is
may
11,
1973,
newman
participated
in
a
two-and-one-half
hour
question
and
answer
session
with
two
attorneys
for
the
government
mr.
lebowitz
and
keilp.
a
postal
inspector
by
the
name
of
dora
marshall
(ph),
mr.
newman’s
own
counsel
and
a
reporter.
newman’s
testimony
briefly
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
court
reporter,
yes
sir.
newman’s
testimony
briefly
touched
on
some
of
the
matters
alleged
in
the
indictment
but
it
did
not
cover
all
of
his
testimony
in
direct.
the
session,
this
may
11
session
with
the
two
prosecutors
and
the
court
reporter
concluded
with
the
prosecutor's
observation
as
follows,
for
the
record,
the
time
is
now
4:30
we
have
not
exhausted
all
the
transactions
in
which
mr.
newman
can
testify.
we
intend
to
continue
this
discussion
of
the
record
at
a
later
time
as
well
as
the
goldberg
transactions
which
will
be
explored
at
a
further
time.
on
cross-examination
by
petitioner
of
newsman
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
i
gave
--.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
justice
steven
i
was
and
that
was
where
our
cross-examination
commenced
when
we
began
it
with
mr.
newman.
on
cross-examination
we
--
the
respondent
or
the
petitioner
established
that
newman
met
with
just
the
two
prosecutors
mr.
lebowitz
and
keilp
may
12,
june
9,
june
10,
june
11
and
june
16,
1973.
at
those
sessions
no
reporter
was
present
and
neither
or
either
of
the
two
postal
inspectors
who
were
assisting
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
in
cross-examination
with
regard
to
what
happened
at
these
sessions,
newman
testified
that
the
prosecutors
would
take
notes
at
which
they
would
read
back
to
him
from
time
to
time
in
which
newman
would
correct.
after
establishing
these
facts,
petitioner
moved
for
production
of
these
notes
under
the
authority
of
the
jencks
act.
the
court
without
waiting
to
hear
from
the
government
and
without
inspecting
any
of
the
notes,
denied
petitioner's
request
sua
sponte
on
the
basis
that
these
notes
constituted
the
prosecuting
attorney's
work
product.
petitioner
twice
thereafter
following
two
days
renewed
his
motion
for
production
of
these
notes
under
the
terms
of
jencks.
the
second
time
in
a
written
memorandum
which
asserted
that
the
notes
if
outside
the
jencks
act
were
compellable
under
the
doctrine
of
brady
versus
maryland.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
do
not
know
what
they
included
at
that
time
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
donald
smaltz
no
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
no
sir,
they
are
not
part
of
the
may
11
statement.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
think
that
that
is
a
fair
inference.
i
think
something
that
adds
to
that
inference
is
the
fact
that
when
the
prosecutor
lodged
these
materials
with
the
ninth
circuit,
they
were
in
response
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
claiming
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
notes
of
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes,
i
assume
so,
i
never
saw
the
notes
but
according
to
solicitor
general's
office,
i
so
understand.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
donald
smaltz
that
is
correct.
now,
the
district
court
judge
on
these
three
occasions
the
request
for
the
notes
was
made
without
reexamining
the
notes,
that
each
motion
with
the
assertion
of
the
notes
were
work
product
and
refused
even
to
inspect
the
notes
in
camera.
mr.
donald
smaltz
mr.
chief
justice
--
thank
you.
i
believe
that
page
94
is
where
the
district
court
judge
for
the
first
time
annunciates
the
work
product
doctrine
here.
mr.
donald
smaltz
judge
kopal
(ph).
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
judge
kalse
(ph)
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
believe
your
honor.
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
hear
it.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
think
it
is.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
believe,
i
do
not
believe
the
author
was
identified,
i
have
the
impression
it
was
written
by
judge
kalse
(ph)
but
not
from
what
appears.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
think
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
the
jencks
act,
that
fact
is
a
key
fact.
mr.
donald
smaltz
no,
none
of
the
notes
that
the
prosecutors
at
solicitor
general's
office
have
lodged
with
the
court
are
so
identified.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
believe
mr.
justice
powell
that
the
case
are
to
be
reversed.
mr.
donald
smaltz
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
campbell,
there
was
campbell
i
and
campbell
ii.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
have
saved
a
lot
of
time
and
after
they
had
reversed
and
remanded
first
time
around.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
in
campbell
that
was
decided,
i
recall
1963
the
facts
that
the
jencks
act
presented
still
a
relatively
new
piece
of
legislation.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
if
i
may
suggest
mr.
justice
brennan
that
i
think
that
the
court's
opinion
in
clancy
versus
united
states
is
more
appropriate
for
this
reason.
the
first
place
the
government
has
conceded
that
at
least
some
of
the
notes
were
jencks
acts
statements
and
should
have
been
turned
over.
they
take
the
position
that
it
had
most
harmless
error,
but
as
the
court
held
in
clancy
that
once
it
established
that
some
of
the
notes
are
jencks
act
statement
and
the
defendant
has
been
denied,
those
notes
to
the
actions
of
the
government
that
is
not
for
appellate
courts
to
speculate.
further,
as
to
the
use
could
have
been
made
further,
i
submit
it
is
a
very
difficult
decision.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
they
did
say
it.
mr.
donald
smaltz
the
government
has
conceded
that
some
of
them
are
statements.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes,
they
have
your
honor,
i
believe
in
their
brief,
we
pointed
out
on
our
reply
brief
that
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
no
but
i
believe
that
the
facts
appear
in
the
record
of
the
court
below.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
do
know
that
you
have
to
decide
it
and
i
know
if
this
case
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
he
sort
of
testified.
mr.
donald
smaltz
we
do
not.
mr.
donald
smaltz
the
petitioner
mr.
justice
brennan
did
not
ask
this
court
to
sit
as
an
easy,
if
it
please
this
court,
it
was
the
government.
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
we
made
an
appropriate
record
below
and
that
the
government
toward
the
petitioner's
effort
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
at
the
time.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
do
not
know
that
your
honor
and
i
cannot
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
we
did.
mr.
donald
smaltz
the
government
started
--
yes
they
did
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
smaltz
that
is
true,
they
said
they
were
not,
but
i
have
difficulty
understanding
how
the
court
of
appeals
could
work
their
way
through
those
notes.
mr.
donald
smaltz
the
addition
to
be
in
wrong
as
a
matter
of
right,
i
think
this
is
a
faction
matter,
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
work
their
way
through
those
notes
when
there
was
no
explanation
at
all.
at
least
the
solicitor
general
on
his
brief
here
purports
to
give
some
explanation,
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
it
would
help
very
much.
mr.
donald
smaltz
we
cannot
identify
which
notes
the
witness
is
referring
to
in
his
cross-examination.
mr.
donald
smaltz
we
never
contended
they
were
statements
of
the
defendant
your
honor
and
neither
did
the
government
that
may
have
been
an
error.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
donald
smaltz
on
first
place,
may
i
respond
the
question
this
way
mr.
justice
powell,
we
have
set
forth
there
are
some
additional
facts
in
our
brief,
our
opening
brief
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
donald
smaltz
at
least
to
some
extent
more
specific.
the
problem
was
that
we
wanted
to
have
the
trial
judge
make
an
in
camera
inspection
as
this
court
has
required
since
palermo
versus
united
states,
and
at
that
point
in
time
we
would
then
ask
him
to
take
extrinsic
evidence
to
try
and
prove
our
contention
that
the
statements
were
adopted
or
proved
by
the
witness.
the
trial
judge
absolutely
refused
to
conduct
an
in
camera
proceeding
or
even
look
at
the
notes.
so
we
were
close
down
at
the
threshold.
the
government
stood
silent
on
two
occasions
while
the
trial
judge
stated
that
the
work
product
privilege
applied
on
the
third
occasion,
the
government
claimed
work
product
privilege
when
the
case
got
up
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
government
abandoned
the
work
product
privilege
and
for
the
first
time
contended
that
they
were
not
statements
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
donald
smaltz
when
was
this
testimony?
mr.
donald
smaltz
when
he
says
that
on
the
first
time
he
really
was
not
sure
whether
that
was
part
of
the
pattern,
that
was
given
your
honor
on
--
the
testimony
was
given
at
the
start
of
his
cross-examination.
i
do
not
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
smaltz
yes
sir
there
is.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
think
we
set
forth
each
and
every
instance
of
what
he
said.
mr.
donald
smaltz
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
they
could
not
be
pursued
because
the
government
--
the
trial
judge
shut
us
down,
he
said,
i
in
essence
until
you
find
the
case
it
says
work
--
that
attorney's
notes
are
not
work
product,
i
am
not
going
to
do
anything.
each
time
we
said,
well
would
you
please
look
at
the
notes,
he
said
no,
not
until
you
find
this
case,
until
you
find
a
case.
so
he
would
not
conduct
any
sort
of
in
camera
proceedings
at
all,
thank
you.
mr.
donald
smaltz
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
smaltz
your
honor,
i
want
to
take
the
grant
the
court
has
offer
to
allow
me
five
more
minutes.
mr.
donald
smaltz
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
the
fact
that
the
government
contends
that
we
do
not
renew
our
motion
for
the
statements
of
the
prosecutor's
of
mr.
newman's
conversations
at
the
time
newman
testified
in
rebuttal.
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
we
have
to
make
the
request
but
the
trial
judge
cut
a
short
and
said
there
is
an
attorney
work
product
exception
and
i
submit
that
we
would
have
taken
a
significant
chance
of
arousing
judge
kopal
ire
if
after
having
the
head
demotion
denied
three
times,
we
would
have
come
up
again
with
the
same
request
just
because
newman
is
on
rebuttal.
secondly,
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
--
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
the
government
--
i
do
not
plead
they
would
have,
if
the
government
had
told
in
the
day
exist
because
on
may
15,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
before
the
trial
begin,
this
is
not
covered
in
the
brief
but
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
a99
of
the
reporter's
transcript
the
judge
entered
what
might
be
referred
to
as
a
continuing
order
for
the
government
to
turnover
all
jencks
act's
statements.
judge
kopal
orders
the
government
on
may
15
before
the
trial
begins
to
produce
every
document
which
he
had
in
his
possessions
or
as
it
deems
possession
they
are
out
to
produce
copies
of
them
for
you
referring
to
me
because
i
have
made
this
motion.
for
the
defendant,
that
is
every
document
that
is
to
be
used
in
presentation
of
the
government's
case,
all
jencks
act's
statements
who
witnesses
who
will
or
may
be
called
will
be
delivered
to
the
defendant
by
tomorrow.
mr.
donald
smaltz
no
sir
it
is
not.
mr.
donald
smaltz
it
is
in
the
record,
but
it
is
not
in
the
appendix.
mr.
donald
smaltz
it
is
in
the
reporter's
transcript
at
page
a99.
i
believe
that
it
was
the
intent
of
judge
kopal
(ph)
to
have
the
government
turnover
to
the
defense
all
jencks
act
statements,
but
judge
kopal
had
no
way
of
knowing
as
the
defendant
had
no
way
of
knowing
of
the
fact
that
newman
was
writing
these
statements
and
there
was
no
way
for
that
fact
to
come
to
attention
of
anybody
unless
the
prosecutor
fulfilled
its
duty
and
called
that
fact
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
which
it
did
not
do
so.
mr.
donald
smaltz
well,
i
moved
three
times
because
i
believe
that
mr.
lebowitz
had
taken
notes
which
constituted
jencks
act
statements
and
i
believe
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
feel
that
that
complied
or
that
attorney's
notes
were
required
as
jencks
acts
statements.
during
the
cross
--
during
the
direct
examination
of
newsman,
even
sitting
away
at
counsel
table,
i
could
observe
that
the
prosecutor
was
reading
from
a
document
that
was
handwritten
out
and
rather
detailed
and
i
was
not
creating
my
neck
to
see
that
because
there
was
a
huge
book
that
the
prosecutor
had
on
his
desk
and
that
is
what
prompted
me
initially
in
my
cross-examination
to
ask
those
questions
about
attorney's
notes.
further,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
5
and
6
of
our
reply
briefs
because
the
second
reason
that
i
asked
about
attorney's
notes
was
that
newsman,
while
he
was
committed
to
having
made
a
complete
statement
to
the
government
by
the
terms
of
that
plea
agreement,
only
made
a
partial
statement
and
i
knew
that
somewhere
along
he
had
to
fulfill
that
requirement
to
the
government
and
i
felt
it
was
odd
that
a
reporter
was
not
present
and
in
pages
5
and
6
of
our
reply
brief,
we
attempt
to
analyze
why
that
agreement
in
and
off
itself
makes
the
attorney's
notes
compellable.
i
would
like
to
say
one
more
thing
and
that
is
that
the
government
argues,
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
to
shield
prosecutor's
trial
notes
from
production.
our
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
congress
in
enacting
jencks
act
which
was
cited
in
the
government's
brief
discloses
no
such
concern
for
attorney's
notes,
but
does
disclose
a
concern
for
the
witness,
in
questioning
a
witness
about
a
statement
he
never
saw
or
whose
language
he
never
adopted
or
approved.
now,
the
congressional
intent
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
adoption
or
approval,
we
agree
is
not
precisely
set
forth
in
legislative
history,
but
nonetheless
the
thrust
of
the
provision
was
to
ensure
that
unless
the
defendant
had
in
some
way
been
informed
that
the
statements
attributed
to
him
and
has
indicated
his
approval
of
their
accuracy
the
summaries
should
not
be
turned
over
to
the
defense,
but
in
the
context
of
this
case
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
forth
at
pages
6
and
7
of
our
reply
brief,
newman
was
committed
to
giving
an
accurate
statement
and
the
prosecutors
were
committed
to
receiving
an
accurate
statement
for
the
reasons
we
have
expressed
in
our
brief
and
here
at
oral
argument,
we
respectfully
submit
that
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
reversed
in
a
new
trial
order.
