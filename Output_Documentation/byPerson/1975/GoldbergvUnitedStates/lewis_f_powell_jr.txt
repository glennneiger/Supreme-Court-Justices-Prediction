justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
how
do
you
think
the
case
should
be
disposed
off?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
remanded
in
what
sort
of
direction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
smaltz
what
the
court
of
appeals
mean
by
statements
of
the
defendant,
this
weren't
statements
of
the
defendant,
were
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
case,
but
i
am
having
difficulty
knowing
exactly
what
the
issue
is
on
page
55
to
57
of
the
sg's
brief.
he
quotes
testimony
which
i
take
it
to
be
newmanâ€™s
testimony,
page
55,
and
it
says
that
this
is
virtually
all
that
actually
newman
says
concerning
his
adoption
or
approval
of
the
notes.
now
if
in
fact
that
is
virtually
all,
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
newman
indeed
did
adopt
or
approve
any
of
this
notes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
testimony
of
newman?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
more
specific
that
this.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
was
this
testimony
given
by
newman?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
testimony
in
which
he
indicated
he
really
did
not
know
on
55,
57
of
the
sg's
brief.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
during
the
trial
itself?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
there
is
no
further
--
well
that
his
reference
in
one
of
your
briefs
to
some
additional
testimony.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
not
quite
as
specific
as
this
(inaudible).
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
is
that
so
at
that
time,
what
could
not
that
have
been
pursued
beyond
that
point?
