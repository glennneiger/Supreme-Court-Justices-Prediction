mr.
paul
l.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
to
take
a
minute
or
two
with
the
outset
to
try
to
explain
the
notes
handwritten
by
newman.
some
of
what
i
say
about
them
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
what
we
at
least
have
been
informed
about
these
notes
because
it
might
clear
some
things
up.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes
i
will
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
now,
it
is
true
that
there
were
three
request
for
jencks
material
when
newman
was
testifying
in
the
government's
case
in
chief.
in
each
case
the
request
was
for
prosecutors
notes
and
in
each
case
well
at
least
in
the
third
case,
this
is
in
the
record,
in
the
written
motion
filed
by
mr.
smaltz,
he
specifically
said
we
are
talking
about
notes
that
were
generated
prior
to
the
time
that
mr.
newman
took
the
stand
in
the
government's
case
in
chief.
there
was
no
jencks
request
when
newman
took
the
stand
as
a
rebuttal
witness.
in
the
appendix
on
page
110,
mr.
smaltz
begins
to
lay
the
foundation
and
inquires
have
you
met
with
the
prosecutors
again
since
you
completed
your
testimony
in
the
government's
case
of
chief
and
the
answer
was
yes,
he
spent
all
day
on
july
4,
with
the
prosecutors
and
he
has
been
in
there
offices
on
the
average
of
five
hours
a
day
since
the
july
4,
and
this
all
took
place
as
i
recall
on
july
9,
this
testimony.
the
question
was
never
asked
what
happened
there,
did
the
prosecutors
take
notes,
did
you
write
notes,
there
was
no
request
for
jencks
material.
now
we
think
that
in
--
and
let
me
say
this
which
is
not
in
the
record.
we
have
been
informed
that
all
of
the
notes
handwritten
by
newman
were
generated
after
he
left
the
stand
in
the
government's
case
in
chief
that
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
again
--
this
is
not
in
the
record,
the
prosecutor
scooped
up
all
the
notes
that
related
to
newman
and
newman’s
testimony
and
things
that
newman
had
told
them
and
put
them
in
one
pile
both
the
prosecutor's
notes
and
the
notes
handwritten
by
newsman.
he
did
the
same
thing
in
relation
to
other
witnesses,
he
put
them
in
his
files.
in
writing
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
made
a
mistake,
some
notes
relating
to
another
witness
not
involved
in
the
issue
here
had
been
turned
over
for
in
camera
inspection,
his
recollection
was
they
had
also
turned
these
notes
over
for
in
camera
inspection.
that
is
what
he
said
in
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
time
of
oral
arguments
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
mr.
smaltz
had
filed
the
brief
that
the
court
had
some
question
about
whether
it
would
accept
because
it
was
too
long
for
a
reply
brief
and
some
sort
of
an
arrangement
was
struck
where
by
he
would
waive
oral
arguments
if
the
court
would
let
him
file
his
brief,
the
government
was
then
asked
would
it
waive
oral
argument
too,
not
wanting
to
interfere
with
the
court's
plan
to
save
some
time,
the
government
said
sure.
as
a
result
it
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
explain
all
that
was
in
this
packet
of
notes
that
was
then
being
lodged
with
the
court.
it
did
explain
that
it
made
a
mistake
in
its
brief
and
now
it
would
like
to
lodge
these
notes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
was
not
orally
argued
before
the
ninth
circuit
as
i
understand.
the
notes
were
turned
over,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
were
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals,
yes
not
turned
over
to
mr.
smaltz.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
not
sure.
i
am
informed
that
it
was
voluntarily
on
the
part
of
the
government,
the
court
since
the
issue
before
was
whether
prosecutor's
notes
or
statements
and/or
work
product
probably
when
it
reviewed
the
notes
operated
under
the
assumption
that
these
were
all
written
by
the
prosecutors
although
there
were
number
of
different
handwritings
involved,
there
were
a
number
of
different
prosecutors
involved.
they
concluded
on
the
phase
of
the
notes
that
they
want
statements.
now,
we
operated
on
the
assumption
that
these
were
all
prosecutor's
notes
at
the
time
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they
were
not
statements
of
the
witness
newsman.
now
the
court
said
statements
of
the
defendant
and
we
think
that
that
is
just
a
mistake
because
that
is
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
right,
if
it
was
statements
of
the
defendant,
they
would
have
been
turned
over
under
rule
16.
we
found
out
that
some
of
these
notes
were
handwritten
by
newman
after
we
have
filed
our
opposition
to
the
cert
petition
and
after
the
court
granted
cert
because
frankly
that
is
the
time
we
begin
to
look
at
the
case
very
closely
for
the
first
time.
we
felt
obligated
to
explain
the
difference
in
the
notes
and
to
make
some
argument
regarding
the
newman
notes
and
because
of
all
the
confusion
and
because
mr.
smaltz
had
not
seen
these
notes,
we
gave
him
a
copy
of
the
whole
packet
of
notes.
but
that
is
where
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
why?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we
were
too
generous
perhaps.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
in
turning
them
over
we
did
not
intend
to
indicate
to
anybody
that
they
were
jencks
material.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
trial
court,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals
we
are
talking
about
here
where
we
want
to
make
arguments
concerning
work
products,
concerning
what
are
statements
and
concerning
as
a
large
portion
of
our
brief
discusses
the
kinds
of
things
that
prosecutors
generally
write,
the
kinds
of
notes
that
they
create
in
preparing
for
trial
as
opposed
to
agent's
notes
and
in
order
to
argue
that
and
to
permit
mr.
smaltz
to
aruge
that,
and
again,
may
be
we
are
too
generous,
we
gave
him
the
note
so
he
could
respond,
it
does
no
concession,
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
why?
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
again
we
are
arguing
that
on
the
phase
of
the
notes
you
can
tell
that
they
are
not
statements,
the
prosecutors
did
not
give
it
to
him
although
again,
i
am
under
the
impression
that
mr.
smaltz
was
at
least
given
the
opportunity
to
glance
through
this
packet
of
notes
at
that
time
not
a
chance
to
see
them
have
them
study
them,
but
to
glance
through
them
and
see
the
general
nature
of
them.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i
am
not
sure
he
disagrees
with
that
statement.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
again
it
is
not
in
the
record,
as
to
the
newman
notes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
since
he
was
the
prosecutor
of
the
trial
case,
he
knew
it
but
he
did
not
register
in
his
mind
and
he
did
make
a
note,
he
just
pulled
that
the
packet
of
notes
said
newman
on
the
cover
and
lodged
them
with
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
is
what
they
assumed,
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
it
depends,
well
if
the
judge
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
if
they
have
been
turned
over
at
the
time
the
request
was
made,
as
i
understand
the
newman
notes
did
not
exist,
so
they
would
not
have
been
turned
over
and
since
there
was
no
renew
jencks
request
when
newman
testified
as
a
rebuttal
witness,
there
was
nothing
that
made
the
prosecutors
think
that
they
have
not
turned
these
over,
there
was
no
demand
forth,
they
want
to
think
about
it,
they
were
on
the
midst
of
seven
week
trial.
so
there
are
number
of
things
that
can
be
done
with
the
newman
notes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
do
not
think
that
we
are
sometimes
correcting
the
impression.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
it
was
our
obligation
to
make
that
known
as
soon
as
being
aware
of
it,
whether
it
was
also
our
obligation
to
give
mr.
smaltz
a
copy
of
the
packet
of
the
notes
at
that
time
is
the
only
plan
which
i
am
saying
perhaps
we
were
too
generous.
but
certainly
we
had
an
obligation
to
let
this
court
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we
conceded
this,
we
concede
that
the
notes
handwritten
by
newman,
40
pages
of
notes,
in
that
40
pages
is
a
seven
page
narrative
which
newman
wrote
out
sitting
in
the
prosecutor's
office
explaining
relationships
between
goldberg
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we
concede
that
it
is
a
statement.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
because
there
was
no
demand
for
it.
so
statements
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
fair
to
say.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
what
we
have
said
in
our
brief
is
that
perhaps
the
appropriate
procedure
is
for
a
campbell
hearing
as
to
those
notes
and
if
the
court
were
inclined
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we
think
we
know
but
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
the
seven
page
narrative
it
and
indeed
all
of
the
40
pages
of
notes
handwritten
by
newman,
we
are
under
the
impression
we
have
been
told
were
written
after
newman’s
direct
testimony
in
the
government's
case
in
chief.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
our
understanding
and
if
you
look
at
the
statement
it
be,
there
is
a
great
support
for
that.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
contains
statements
by
the
witness
that
were
not
disclosed
to
the
defense.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
now
on
the
other
hand
when
you
look
at
the
statements,
particular
at
seven
page
narrative
which
is
the
only
thing
we
can
see
is
the
statement
within
the
meaning
of
jencks.
it
relates
to
testimony
given
by
a
witness
named
paridin
(ph)
who
testified
as
a
defense
witness
after
newman
testified
in
the
government's
case
in
chief
and
when
newman
took
the
stand
as
a
rebuttal
witness,
he
began
to
testify
concerning
relationships
with
paridin
(ph)
and
he
was
cut
off
by
an
objection
from
mr.
smaltz
sustained
by
the
court
at
least
until
the
prosecutor
could
show
the
court
in
a
transcript
because
it
was
daily
copy,
what
part
of
paridin's
(ph)
testimony
was
to
rebut.
a
page-and-a-half
of
that
seven
page
statement
relates
to
the
testimony
before
newman
was
cut
off.
in
fact
this
testimony
is
almost
verbatim
from
that
seven
page
statement.
so
it
is
the
inference
we
think,
is
clear
that
it
was
not
created
until
afternoon
and
left
the
standing
and
after
paridin
(ph)
has
testified
and
in
any
of
that
only
page-and-a-half
of
239
pages
of
notes
relates
in
any
way
to
testimonying
a
trial
and
it
is
completely
consistent
and
almost
verbatimly
consistent
with
what
he
said
a
trial
so
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
is
a
type
of
argument
that
should
be
made
to
the
trial
court
but
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right
and
additionally
but
again
this
is
something
that
we
have
to
argue
on
the
basic
things
outside
the
record,
there
was
no
renewed
demand
for
the
jencks,
for
jencks
material
at
the
time
when
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we
do
not.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
leads
us
to
the
newman
notes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
not
necessary
the
prosecutor's
notes,
now
again
may
be
the
prosecutor
should
never
have
turned
the
newman
notes
over
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
because
they
were
not
in
the
record,
he
knew
they
did
not
exist
at
the
time
the
jencks
request
was
made,
the
jencks
request
was
only
for
prosecutor's
notes,
it
was
only
for
prosecutor's
notes
that
existed
at
the
time
that
newman
testified
in
the
government's
case
in
chief.
there
was
no
renewed
jencks
request
at
all
when
newman
takes
the
stand
and
rebuttal
and
certainly
none
for
the
notes
handwritten
by
newsman,
so
it
should
not
have
been
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor
unless
there
is
something
in
the
notes
that
is
truly
exculpatory
in
the
brady
sense
unless
there
are
facts.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
he
contended
that
there
was
a
brad.-
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
prosecutor
examined
that
everything
that
he
had
and
in
response
to
the
court
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
don't
think
this
court
has
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
at
that
time,
again
it
is
not
on
the
record,
we
do
not
know
whether
he
went
through
this
packet
of
notes
before
his
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
just
suddenly
realized
that
they
never
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
he
was
under
the
impression
until
he
walked
into
the
courtroom
that
it
was
already
in
the
record.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
was
not,
but
he
prepared
for
all
argument
i
gather
because
--
anyway.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
is
not
in
the
record,
what
exactly
the
process
he
went
through
before
he
lodged
this
with
the
court.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
said
i
do
not
know
that.
i
do
not
know
whether
he
did
or
did
not.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
that
is
true,
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
that
on
the
campbell,
excuse
me
and
the
notes
handwritten
by
mr.
newman
with
the
record
in
this
stage,
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
undertake
the
process
of
determining
that
there
was
no
air
or
harmless
air
that
there
should
be
a
campbell
hearing
with
regard
to
the
newman
notes.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
deals
with
the
notes
written
by
the
prosecutor
and
as
we
understand
that
that
is
the
issue
that
the
court
was
interested
in
when
certiorari
was
granted.
we
do
not
think
there
has
to
be
that
kind
of
a
hearing
with
regard
to
those
notes
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
that
by
their
nature
and
in
this,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
lawyers
notes
taken
in
preparation
for
trial
are
not
going
to
be
99
times
out
of
a
100,
jencks
act
statements.
he
does
not
write
along
narrative
continuous
account
of
things,
we
would
never
be
able
to
use
the
notes
and
examining
a
witness
in
court.
we
think
that
it
would
be
useless
to
say
that
the
palermo
and
campbell
procedure
of
an
in
camera
inspection
and
the
taking
of
extrinsic
evidence
that
applies
when
agents
make
reports,
should
always
apply
to
prosecutors,
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
we
had
a
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
the
impression
that
you
have
is
wrong.
in
my
own
experience
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
because
i
do
not
think
that
most
people
believe
the
prosecutor's
notes
contains
jencks
act
statements.
in
my
own
experience
as
an
assistance
us
attorney,
they
will
have
a
request,
really
request
for
prosecutors
notes,
prosecutors
take
notes
in
--
and
everybody
has
its
own
way
of
taking
notes
obviously
but
you
write
down
the
general
subject
matter
you
want
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
what
seems
to
me
to
be
automatically
turned
over.
a
reports
of
investigative
agents,
fbi,
secret
service,
postal
inspectors
that
kind
of
thing
or
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
had
here
were
the
prosecutors
took
a
statement
from
question
and
answer
statement
under
note,
under
oath
which
is
clearly.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
now
our
position
as
i
think
we
made
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
our
position
is
not
that,
and
that
is
why
we
do
not
say
there
is
a
broad
attorney's
work
product
exception
just
because
something
has
taken
them
by
a
prosecutor
instead
of
an
agent,
it
is
not
exempt
from
the
jencks
act.
but
the
nature
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
taken
by
a
prosecutor
will
normally
not
be
a
statement
within
the
meaning
of
jencks
act.
this
89
page
statement
under
oath
taken
by
the
prosecutors
clearly
a
jencks
act
statement,
but
his
cryptic
notations
preparing
himself
to
examine
witnesses,
99
times
of
a
100
will
not
contain
the
kind
of
statements
the
jencks
was
talking.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
has
come
up
in
some
of
the
circuits
and
the
circuits
have
considered
the
work
product
question
and
said
there
is
no
--
generally
they
have
said
there
is
no
broad
work
product,
exception
but
a
number
of
them
have
said,
we
have
looked
more
closely
with
the
prosecutor's
notes.
there
are
certain
problems
that
develop
when
their
prosecutor's
notes
that
we
are
talking
about
that
do
not
develop
when
there
are
investigative
agent's
notes
and
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
say
here.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
everything
that
was
a
jencks
act
statement,
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
the
notes
taken
by
the
prosecutors,
some
of
them
were
in
existence
certainly.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
not
the
narrative.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
it
maybe
subsumed
within
the
brady
question
but
there
is
nothing
exculpatory
and
then
he
has
had
the
notes
for
five
months
now
and
has
pointed
out
nothing
as
exculpatory.
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
it
is
not
included
within
the
question
on
which
certiorari
was
granted.
but
as
we
try
to
point
out
in
our
brief
it
is
not
mr.
smaltz's
fault
that
he
did
not
raise
the
additional
question,
we
do
want
to
where
the
court
would
have
granted
cert
on
the
additional
question
of
the
witnesses
on
handwritten
notes
because
that
is
clear.
if
they
fall
in
the
definition
of
a
statement
and
were
written
by
the
witness,
they
should
be
turned
over
on
proper
demand.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
as
to
the
prosecutor's
notes
however,
we
think
they
are
not
statements.
an
examination
which
the
court
of
appeals
might
show
that
they
are
not
statements
that
the
real
kind
of
tough
issue
in
the
case,
i
think
it
is
not
the
question
of
what
a
statement
is,
but
what
is
adopted
or
approved,
what
does
that
mean
and
they
must
be
in
order
to
be
producible
under
jencks.
both
statement
of
the
witness
and
adopted
or
approved
by
the
witness.
these
were
not
adopted
or
approved
because
we
think
adopted
or
approved
means
that
the
precise
words
written
in
the
notes
have
to
adopted
or
approved
or
else
it
is
not
fair
to
try
to
impeach
someone
with
words
that
are
on
his
own
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
supports
us,
i
think
that
e2
was
intended
to
broader
that
e1
not
just
the
opposite
and
the
court
said
that
in
palermo
and
even
mr.
smaltz's
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no
i
do
not.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
because
there
were
prosecutors'
notes,
there
was
a
representation
by
an
attorney
and
officer
of
the
court,
but
they
were
not
substantially
verbatim,
not
written
by
the
witness
and
not
continuous
narrative
kinds
of
statement
included
within
the
jencks
act
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
were
adopted
or
approved
within
the
meaning
of
the
jencks
act.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they
were
the
general
content
of
the
notes,
the
general
facts
were
checked
with
the
witness
but
not
the
words
of
the
notes,
and
in
fact
mr.
smaltz
is
interestingly
not
relies
on
a
characterization
that
the
assistance
us
attorney
made
in
his
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
entries
in
the
notes
were
only
made
after
a
lengthy
conversation
and
a
mutual
understanding
of
the
facts
was
reached.
he
says
that
indicates
adopted
or
approved,
we
think
that
indicates
just
the
opposite.
they
sat
there
for
a
long
time
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
that
exert
of
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
page
92
of
the
appendix.
the
question
that
mr.
smaltz
said,
was
were
they,
the
notes
occasionally
read
back
to
you
to
see
whether
or
not
they
correctly
understood
what
you
were
saying
and
the
answer
was
probably
from
time
to
time.
alright
sir,
did
you
either
correct
them
or
say
yes
that
is
right
or
no
that
is
not
right
because
it
went
this
way
i
believe
or
words
to
that
effect
and
he
said
yes
that
would
happen.
again
this
may
be
subject
to
interpretation
but
i
think
the
reasonable
interpretation
that
he
was
not
correcting
the
words
taken
down
by
the
prosecutors
in
the
sense
of
adopting
those
words
that
is
on
but
he
was
saying
yes
that
is
right,
certain
facts
happened
that
way
or
no
it
is
not
right,
those
facts
did
not
occur.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
the
only
thing
that
we
know
that
they
had
to
do
with
some
of
the
notes
taken
on
june
9
or
10,
but
of
course
he
met
with
the
prosecutors,
may
13
june
9,
10,
16,
17,
18
,19,
20,
21,
22,
23,
24,
25,
26,
before
he
ever
took
the
stand
in
direct
and
then
he
met
with
them
number
of
times
before
his
rebuttal
testimony.
so
we
are
talking
about
one
part
of
possibly
two
days
meetings
with
the
prosecutors
in
which
there
was
a
general
verification
of
the
facts
the
way
i
read
and
not
an
actual
adoption
or
approval
of
the
words.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
do
not
believe
so,
i
think
that
we,
the
general
policy
is
that
adoption
or
approval
means
some
sort
of
a
formal
acceptance
of
the
words
comparable
to
initialing
or
signature
but
not
necessarily
initialing
or
signature
and
perhaps
something
more
specific
on
auto
exist.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no
signing,
no
indication
that
he
ever
looked
at
the
prosecutor's
notes
and
no
reason
why
he
would
look
at
the
prosecutor's
notes.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
any
of
these
pages
other
than
those
that
have
now
been
identified
were
adopted
or
approved
by
him
in
any
way.
in
fact
mr.
smaltz
in
his
reply
brief
keeps
referring
when
he
list
the
categories
of
things
to
information
of
the
notes
but
he
never
calls
them
statements,
he
list
six
pages
on
which
there
are
direct
quotations
and
there
is
a
single
thing
in
quotation
marks
on
each
page,
but
even
there
we
cannot
be
entirely
sure
that
they
are
newman’s
words,
that
might
be
a
paraphrase
that
relate
to
conversations
he
and
other
people
had.
but
mr.
smaltz
have
got
this
information,
he
does
not
call
them
statements.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
mr.
newman
was
a
lawyer
who
had
not
practice
law
in
some
years
but
he
was
a
lawyer
and
he
was
intimately
familiar
with
the
operation
of
this
insurance
company
and
the
prosecutors
having
about
three
weeks
to
prepare
needed
his
education
on
things.
let
me
just
say
one
thing
about
the
brady
question,
there
seem
to
be
two
brady
questions
that
he
is
raising,
one
is
that
non
jencks
tight
material
may
never
the
less
be
brady
because
it
would
be
helpful
on
cross-examination
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
unless
it
contains
exculpatory
facts
materials
substance
of
kinds
of
evidence,
it
is
not
brady
and
he
still
has
not
shown.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes.
i
mean
if
newman
said
goldberg
did
not
do
any
of
these
things,
i
have
told
you
for
three
weeks
he
did
and
the
prosecutors
just
brought
a
cryptic
note
that
would
be
brady
but
that
is
because
it
is
not
being
turned
over
to
try
to
impeach
him
with
prior
and
consistent
statements
but
because
it
tends
to
show
that
he
is
not
guilty
in
a
fact
or
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
suppressing
somebody
else's
fingerprints
on
a
gun
or
that
sort
of
thing.
we
are
not
certainly
not
trying
to
limit
brady
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
brady
does
not
subsume
jencks
and
sort
of
swallow
it
up.
his
other
point
has
to
do
with
this
plea
agreement
but
he
cross-examined
about
the
plea
agreement.
he
brought
out
an
awful
lot
of
evidence
about
the
agreement,
the
nature
of
it,
what
newman
expected
from
it,
tried
to
show
bias
and
brought
out
how
much
time
it
spent
with
the
prosecutors
but
he
did
not
know
he
was
followed
up
on
that,
i
got
the
judge
to
give
instructions
upon
the
care
with
what
accomplished
testimony
should
be
considered.
the
judge
instructed
that
newman
was
going
to
get
probation
or
at
least
that
the
prosecutors
were
going
to
recommend
probation
and
even
now
that
he
have
the
notes,
he
does
not
show
how
he
would
have
shown
anymore
with
the
eight
of
the
notes
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
notes
that
relates
to
the
plea
agreement.
the
only
thing
it
shows
is
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
the
prosecutors
and
that
mr.
smaltz
newman
was
able
to
bring
out.
we
think
that
in
this
case
there
is
absolutely
no
legitimate
claim
to
a
new
trial.
there
is
a
legitimate
claim
to
a
hearing
in
the
campbell
sentence
and
the
question
of
the
notes
handwritten
by
newman.
we
think
that
there
need
not
be
such
a
hearing
and
the
notes
handwritten
by
the
prosecutors
if
the
court
accepts
our
view
that
statements,
the
term
statement
and
the
terms
adopted
or
approved
must
be
very
narrowly
defined
as
congress
intended
particularly
when
prosecutor's
notes
are
vowed.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
requires
you
to
leaf
through
the
paper
i
think
because
it
is
pretty
clear
on
its
phase
that
they
are
not
statements.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
but
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it
did
say,
it
did
indicate
that
it
looked
through
the
papers
and
they
are
not
statements.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
on
the
phase
of
the
papers,
it
is
clear
except
as
we
say
in
the
case
of
this
seven
pages
handwritten
by
newman
but
they
are
not
statements.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that
is
right.
but
of
courses
palermo
i
think
said
and
you
would
know
better
than
i
that
when
it
is
clear
that
they
are
statements,
they
are
turned
over.
when
it
is
clear
that
they
are
not
statements,
they
are
not
turned
over
and
it
is
in
those
doubtful
cases
that
you
need
an
in
camera
inspection.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
on
this
case
mr.
smaltz
says
what
he
is
talking
about
because
he
seemed
to,
thank
you.
