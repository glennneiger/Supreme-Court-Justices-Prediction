know

was
handed
to
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall

i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago,
you
did
not
know
about
this
until
you
brought
your
petition
per
se.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
in
the
position
that
pairs
also
evidence,
are
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall

the
jencks
act
material?
justice
thurgood
marshall

papers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
the
work

what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
you
tell
us
what

justice
thurgood
marshall
for
volunteering
part
of
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall

you
give
them
to
in
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
just
your
words
against
his.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
is
not
in
the
record
any
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
judge
examined
in
camera,
would
he
had
find
that
out
that
some
of
these
were
in
newman’s
handwriting?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
on
the
point
of
the
judge
if
you
look
at
it,
that
is
the
only
thing
i
have
talked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
type
of
argument,
it
should
be
made
to
the
trial
court
instead
of
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
a
judge
lie
on
what
us
attorney
recommends,
if
us
attorney
says
i
have
looked
at
this
and
did
not
do
the
and
not
looked
at,
is
that
what
you
are
--
are
you
saying
that
he
presented
something
to
court
that
he
had
not
first
examined
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
not
you
say
a
minute
ago
that
he
had
just
barely
looked
through
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
i
not
assume
that
he
did
look
at
or
is
that
the
way
you
run
us
attorney’s
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
go
back
a
minute,
do
not
you
agree
that
in
this
case
with
the
testimony
before
the
judge,
he
should
have
at
least
looked
at
those?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall

is
nothing
in
this
initial
on
anything
in
here.
justice

work
products

initial
on
anything
like
the
one
that
is
before
us.
