you
told

about?
justice

you
do

justice

certainly
they

that

justice
william
j.

yes,
but
question
is
whether
or

these

are
the
notes
that
we
read

and
as
you
have
told

corrected

questions
of

time
i
think
it
could
under

disposition
be
determined
with
the
trial
judge
and
free
to
reinstate
the
verdict
or
not
as
you
may
determine
whether
the
note
should
have
turned
over.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

certainly
as
to
those
that
we
do
not

i
understand
the
record
present.
that
in
fact
newman
had
corrected
them,
had
read
them
back
and
adopted
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
as
i
understand
it
which,
as
to
which
he
testified
we
do
not
know
of
the
many
papers
that
have
been
filed
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
set
up
a
factual
issue
to
whether
or
not
those
particular
documents
are
not
statements
within
the
meaning
of
the
jencks
act
in
the
sense
of
have
they
been
adopted
by
the
government's
witness?
and
if
that
so
why
does
not
that
require
a
campbell
hearing?
well,
we
cannot
do
it
up
here
obviously.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
a
government
witness
concludes
his
direct
testimony
at
a
federal
criminal
trial,
the
jencks
act
requires
that
the
government
turnover
to
defense
counsel
for
impeachment
purposes,
written
statements
as
defined
by
the
act,
made
or
adopted
an
approved
before
trial
by
the
witness
that
touch
his
direct
testimony.
as
the
government
at
the
trial
objects
that
particular
writings
are
not
statements
within
the
act's
definition
are
although
otherwise
statements
contained
whether
or
not
touched
on
in
the
direct
examination.
the
objections
are
to
be
decided
by
the
trial
judge
usually
in
in-camera
proceedings
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
in
this
case,
the
writings
claimed
to
be
producible
statements,
included
writings
by
government
lawyers
who
had
conducted
extensive
interviews
with
the
government's
principal
witness
before
the
trial.
the
trial
judge,
without
examining
the
writings
or
conducting
any
inquiry
whether
any
or
all
had
adopted
or
approved
by
the
witness,
held
that
the
writings
were
not
producible
because
they
constituted
the
work
product
of
the
government
lawyers,
and
were
therefore
even
if
otherwise
producible
statements
as
defined
by
the
act
not
covered
by
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed,
but
not
on
the
work
product
ground.
rather
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
in
any
event,
the
particular
lawyer's
writings
and
notes
and
other
writings
involved
in
this
case
didn't
fit
the
act's
definition
of
producible
statements.
we
reverse.
we
hold
first
that
nothing
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
of
the
jencks
act
accepts
as
a
lawyer's
work
product
a
statement
taken
from
a
witness
by
a
government
lawyer
rather
than
by
some
other
government
agent,
if
the
statement
falls
within
the
definition
of
a
producible
statement
under
the
act
and
they
hold
further
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
making
the
initial
determination
that
the
writings
in
question
here
were
not
producible
statements
under
the
act,
because
under
the
statute,
that's
the
task
in
the
first
instance
for
the
trial
court.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
stevens
joining
the
court's
opinion
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
on
which
mr.
justice
stewart
joins.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
