unknown
speaker
and
how
much
of
the
so-called
jencks
issue
here
involve
those
particular
notes
and
they
are
written
by
newman?
unknown
speaker
40
out
of
237?
unknown
speaker
and
the
rest
of
the
237
are?
unknown
speaker
was
he
the
attorney?
unknown
speaker
and
these
are
notes
of
conversations
with
newsman,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
assuming
mr.
smaltz
that
anything
impeaching
within
the
language
of
the
jencks
act
necessarily
is
embraced
within
brady?
brady
talked
about
exculpatory
evidence
as
i
recall,
and
they
did
not
say
that
anything
impeaching
to
a
witness
for
the
government
was
necessarily
exculpatory.
unknown
speaker
with
that
opinion
did
not
have
much
support
for
it.
how
many
votes
did
that
got?
unknown
speaker
but
one
of
the
circuits
that
--
you
said
they
were
delivered
to
you
in
august
of
1975?
unknown
speaker
was
there
some
explanation
made
why
they
were
delivering
them
to
you
in
august
1975?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
explanation?.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
understand,
but
you
are
actually
were
given
a
copy
of
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
to
suggest
that
the
government
conceded
in
august
75
that
you
should
have
had
those
when
you
made
the
demand
time
of
trial?
unknown
speaker
why
would
they
give
you
the
--
why
would
they?
everything
else
was
in
camera,
whatever
was
handed
up
was
handed
up
to
judges,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
not
given
to
you?
unknown
speaker
until
august
1975?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
quite
understand
why
they
were
given
to
you
in
august
75.
unknown
speaker
because
they
were
going
to
be
lodged
in
this
court
and
it
is
a
practice
that
for
counsel
whenever
he
lodged
as
anything
with
this
court
in
pending
litigations
the
adversary
know
about
it.
unknown
speaker
and
this
was
filed
with
the
limitation
in
camera
and
examination.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
experience
with
jencks
act
cases
i
have
and
then
quite
a
few
since
i
came
here,
since
the
jencks
act
was
passed
since
i
wrote
the
jencks
opinion.
unknown
speaker
those
things
were
always
handed
up
in
camera.
the
parties
were
not
given
to
them
if
the
government
takes
position
that
they
are
not
subject
to
being
handed
over
on
the
jencks
act.
so
i
do
not
understand
how
you
got
them
in
august
75.
unknown
speaker
by
a
reporter,
you
mean
a
court
--
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
that,
you
did
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript
for
the
may
11
interview?
unknown
speaker
who
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
see
it
in
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
with
an
unidentified
author.
unknown
speaker
he
was
modest
about
it.
unknown
speaker
before
you
continue
it
is
necessary
for
what
i
have
seen
coming
to
decision
of
this
case
to
know
whether
or
not
any
particular
notes
were
identified
by
newman
as
having
them
read
back
to
him?
unknown
speaker
are
any
notes
so
identified?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
reach
the
work
for
that
issue
but
it
did
say
apparently
that
none
of
these
papers
then
handed
up
to
them,
constitute
statements
within
the
meaning
of
the
jencks
act.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
that
is
at
least
one
of
the
issues
here,
it
is
a
threshold
issue
if
you
are
going
to
deal
with
the
case
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did,
does
that
mean
we
must
look
at
these
papers
and
decide
whether
there
are
statements?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
know,
have
they
really
conceded
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
do
you
think
that
determines
some
government
concession
determines
a
construction
of
the
jencks
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
that
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
we
do
have
to
decide
whether
each
one
of
these
pieces
of
paper
is
a
statement
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
mean
when
it
said,
it
is
a
cryptic
sentence
that
simply
says
there
are
not
statements.
what
is
that
based
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
work
product
exemption
and
that
these
were
statements
with
the
meaning
of
the
jencks
act?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
that
government
said
they
want
statements
with
the
meaning
of
the
jencks
act,
did
not
they
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
well
then
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
issue
before
them,
about
whether
they
were
statements
or
not
and
they
said
they
were
not.
unknown
speaker
in
fact
you
think
they
were
quite
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
help
if
they
had
written
it
out,
right
to
be
with
you.
unknown
speaker
and
would
have
certainly
also
have
helped
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
whether
or
not
anything
was
a
statement,
whether
or
not
was
something
led
back
to
the
witness
which
he
had
adopted
after
correction
and
you
could
have
known
that
as
i
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
saying
you
did
not
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
develop
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
they
were
not
statements
of
the
witness.
unknown
speaker
that
is
only
a
mistake.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
did
you
give
it
to
him
because
you
thought
they
were
jencks
materials
to
which
he
was
entitled?
unknown
speaker
well
then
why,
i
don’t
follow
it.
unknown
speaker
ordinary,
the
us
attorney
if
he
thinks
that
are
not
statements
producible
under
jencks
act.
only
lodges
that
my
brother
stewart
says
with
the
judge,
for
in
camera
inspection,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
turns
them
over
to
defense
counsel,
he
turns
them
over
because
us
attorney
agrees
they
are
producible
jencks
statements
is
not
that
it?
unknown
speaker
because
the
case
is
now
here,
so
it
is
--
unknown
speaker
with
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
you
this,
when
this
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
you
did
not
know
or
it
was
not
--
there
was
not
an
awareness
of
the
person
that
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
40
pages
of
the
stuff
was
in
newman’s
handwriting,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
the
presumption
or
the
assumption
or
the
hypothesis
and
the
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
all
his
handwriting
was
handwriting
of
various
prosecutor's
government.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman
just
before
you
leave
this
point
about
whether
you
are
too
generous
to
the
defendant,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
government
gave
the
court
of
appeals
the
impression
that
there
were
entirely
prosecutor's
notes.
unknown
speaker
or
you
would
not
really
say
you
are
too
generous
in
correcting
that
impression
when
there
are
40
pages
of
newman’s
handwriting,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
would
not
that
obligation
mean
to
make
that
known
at
appropriate
time?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
the
packet
of
notes
contain
statements
within
the
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
that
is
a
statement?
unknown
speaker
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
not
turned
over
to
the
trial
judge
for
his
consideration.
unknown
speaker
that
depends
upon
when
it
was
made
and
the
question
once
made
is
not
one
that
is
resolved
by
the
record.
unknown
speaker
that
is
fair
to
say
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well
you
think
you
know
but
is
the
record
clear
enough
that
it
was
made
before
the
testimony,
maybe
the
direct
testimony?
unknown
speaker
and
before
his
testimony
on
rebuttal
?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
understanding.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
to
obviously
we
are
not
the
tribunal
to
resolve
issues
like
that.
unknown
speaker
you
are
understanding
the
time
sequence
is
not
supported
by
the
record
itself,
is
this
part
of
your
off
direct
--
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
can
screw
that
is
what
is
been
lodged
with
this
court
as
part
of
the
record,
we
must
accept
the
fact
that
the
record
does
contains
statements
by
the
witness
that
were
not
disclosed
to
the
defense.
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
record
if
we
decreed
what
you
have
lodged
with
this
court
as
part
of
the
record.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
it
should
have
been
told
or
if
it
have
been
told
what
you
are
telling
that
the
court
now
or
of
if
any
court
had
that
should
have
reached
the
same
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
these
are
not
principle
--
unknown
speaker
if
the
facts
are
you
tell
them,
while
you
tell
us,
we
do
not
know
that
they
are.
unknown
speaker
that
is
why,
i
cannot
understand
why
this
case
does
not
automatically
call
for
campbell
here.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
does,
well
not
to
say
the
whole
words.
unknown
speaker
is
there
not
a
brady
issue
in
the
case
at
that
point?
unknown
speaker
had
not
the
defendant
contended
there
was
a
brady
issue
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
he
would
not
know
the
merits
of
that
contention
without
knowing
whether
or
not
there
was
anything
exculpatory
in
the
notes.
unknown
speaker
the
prosecutor's
examination
may
not
had
been
as
careful
as
it
sometime
should
be.
unknown
speaker
because
apparently
the
prosecutor
was
under
the
impression
that
there
were
40
pages
of
his
notes
that
just
were
not
there.
it
is
a
rather
unusual
situation,
did
he
not
give
the
court
of
appeals
the
impression
that
everything
was
his
own
notes?
unknown
speaker
and
he
must
have
know,
that
better,
must
not
he?
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
a
duty
does
the
government
lawyer
had
in
preparing
for
an
argument
in
the
court
of
appeal,
should
not
he
at
least
look
at
the
file?
unknown
speaker
oh
i
thought
this
was
not
orally
argued?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
i
assume
if
this
case
goes
back
on
a
campbell
remand
someone
has
got
to
go
through
mechanical
process
of
turning
these
pages
over
one
at
a
time,
identifying
the
handwriting
of
one
person
as
distinguished
from
another,
that
is
the
lawyers,
the
notes
of
the
lawyers
for
the
government
as
distinguished
from
things
written
in
a
handwriting
of
newman
is
that
no
so?
unknown
speaker
not
a
curiosity,
i
think
this
is
the
first
jencks
act
case
we
had
now
in
10-15
years,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
had
the
general
impression
that
the
practice
had
grown
up
with
the
perhaps
the
help
of
the
justice
department.
us
attorneys
are
almost
automatically
turning
over
to
defense
counsel,
the
trials
of
everything
they
have
in
the
way
of
no
matter
who
took
notes
of
conversations
with
government
witnesses
right
after
the
government
witness
had
completed
his
direct
examination.
am
i
right
in
that
impression?
unknown
speaker
and
why
don’t
we
have
more
cases
here,
i
am
wondering?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
statements
of
government
witnesses
then
that
are
automatically
turned
over
as
a
matter
of
course?
unknown
speaker
because
certainly
there
maybe
statements
taken
by
prosecutors
which
would
still
be
jencks
act
statements.
unknown
speaker
but
those
things
are
not
they
automatically
turned
over?
unknown
speaker
has
this
kind
of
issue
come
up
before?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
to
the
--
you
think
that
when
the
facts
are
developed
or
if
they
are
developed
that
will
show
that
you
did
turn
over
everything
that
you
had
that
were
statements,
by
the
time
the
witness
got
off
the
stand
on
his
direct
examination.
unknown
speaker
well
,
let
us
say
none
of
these
papers
involved,
you
think
we
have
done
an
existence
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
narrative.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
would
we
have
to
enlarge
the
question
upon
which
we
granted
certiorari
in
order
to
reach
the
newman
notes?
unknown
speaker
customarily
we
administer
certiorari
not
to
do
justice
in
individual
cases
but
to
try
to
get
the
force
issues
that
we
think
are
of
significant
importance
to
the
law
in
general.
unknown
speaker
quite
often
that
appears
after
grant
of
certiorari
that
something
has
happened
that
leads
us
for
example
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
we
do
that
at
least
several
times
during
the
courts
of
a
term
because
of
after
developing
events
and
after
developing
events
in
this
case
if
it
might
lead
us
to
do
something
else
beside
dismissing
the
writ,
do
as
you
suggest
for
example
with
respect
to
the
handwritten
statement
of
newman.
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
that
some
had
been
corrected
--
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
now,
have
we
any
way
of
identifying
from
the
record
precisely
what
notes
were
the
subject
of
that
particular
colloquy?
unknown
speaker
does
the
department
have
any
particular
procedure
by
which
to
signify
approval
or
adoption,
whether
the
interrogation
is
by
an
investigator
official
or
by
a
prosecutor?
unknown
speaker
mr.
newman
was
a
lawyer,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
what
else
you
conceded
that
something
may
not
be
a
statement
within
the
definition
of
the
federal
statute
might
still
be
producible
on
their
brief?
unknown
speaker
real
evidence
or
tangible
evidence
might
be
brady
with
the
statement
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
that
requires
us
to
look
at
the
papers.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
if
it
had
another
alternative
where
we
have
been
to
say
the
work
product
basis
for
the
district
courts
ruling
was
unsound
and
we
may
to
do
this
the
(inaudible)
itself.
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
not
write
any
opinion,
it
did
not
tell
us
anything
about
these
papers.
unknown
speaker
or
it
said
they
were
statements.
unknown
speaker
that
has
to
do
along
the
problems
with
the
statutes
in
the
beginning
that
camera
inspection
has
been
that
parties
argued
these
cases
without
knowing
anything
about
the
materials
and
opinions
cannot
be
written
which
disclosed
what
is
in
the
material.
unknown
speaker
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
lawyers
come
here
and
argue
these
cases,
they
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
and
we
cannot
tell
them
what
they
are
talking
about
and
that
we
have
to
decide.
