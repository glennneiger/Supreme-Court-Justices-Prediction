mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
of
three
judges
for
the
district
of
maryland.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
maryland
law
which
authorizes
the
direct
payment
of
public
aid
to
church-related
and
other
private
colleges.
the
appellants
are
four
maryland
citizens
and
taxpayers.
they
contend
that
this
maryland
law
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth.
the
appellees
are
four
church-related
colleges
of
maryland
as
well
as
the
members
of
the
board
of
public
works
of
maryland
which
is
charged
with
administering
the
statute.
a
three-judge
panel
which
had
been
convened
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
this
legislation
by
a
2-1
vote.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
at
least
one
major
distinction
between
this
legislation
and
other
church
state
legislation
previously
considered
by
the
court.
this
legislation
provides
for
a
general
purpose
grant
to
be
paid
directly
to
church-related
colleges.
it
is
not
limited,
for
example,
to
construction
grants
such
as
this
court
upheld
in
1971
in
tilton
versus
richardson.
the
act
at
issue
would
allow
the
payment
of
both
capital
and
operating
expenditures
with
state
aid,
and
so
the
aid
could
be
used
for
construction,
maintenance,
and
repairs
of
buildings,
teacher
salaries,
scholarships,
and
virtually
any
of
the
myriad
of
costs
which
are
incurred
by
church-related
colleges.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
the
only
use
restriction,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
found
in
section
68
(a)
of
the
act
which
states
that
no
money
shall
be
used
for
sectarian
purposes.
that
is
the
only
use
restriction
which
is
in
the
act
or
in
the
recently
promulgated
regulations.
in
order
for
a
college
to
be
eligible
for
aid,
it
must
meet
a
variety
of
secular
requirements.
for
example,
it
must
be
a
non-profit
educational
institution.
it
must
be
private,
accredited
by
the
state
board
of
education
and
so
forth.
the
only
eligibility
requirement
relating
to
religion
is
that
the
institution
cannot
be
one
awarding
only
seminarian
or
theological
degrees.
and
so,
an
institution
such
as
mt.
st.
mary’s
college,
one
of
the
appellees,
which
awards
both
seminarian
degrees
and
liberal
arts
degrees
may
be
eligible
for
aid
under
the
act.
as
i
have
indicated
earlier,
the
act
is
administered
by
the
state
board
of
public
works.
the
board
of
public
works
is
assisted
by
the
council
for
higher
education
which
undertakes
the
buts
and
bolts
stated
in
the
administration
of
the
act.
the
administration
of
the
act
includes
a
three-stage
process
of
enforcing
the
use
for
sectarian
purposes
restriction.
the
first
stage
is
a
pre-expenditure
report
which
is
filed
annually
by
the
school
with
the
state.
this,
according
to
the
recently
promulgated
regulations,
identifies
the
purposes
for
which
the
aid
is
intended
to
be
used
and
includes
an
affidavit
by
the
institution
that
the
aid
will
not
be
used
for
sectarian
purposes.
the
second
stage,
again,
furnished
on
an
annual
basis,
is
a
so-called
utilization
of
funds
report.
this
is
a
second
report
furnished
by
the
institution
to
the
state
which
describes
how
the
aid
in
fact
has
been
used.
the
third
stage
of
enforcement
of
use
restriction
involves
necessary
follow
up
by
the
state
to
ascertain
that
the
aid
was
not
used
for
religious
purposes.
this
follow
up
may
be
in
the
form
of
inquiries
by
the
state
to
the
institution
for
more
details
as
to
how
the
aid
was
used.
it
may
also
be
in
the
form
of
audits
to
which
these
expenditures
are
subject.
as
of
the
date
of
the
judgment,
there
were
18
aid-recipients
in
maryland.
four
of
these,
four
appellees,
are
admittedly
church-related
institutions.
now,
the
appellees,
as
i
have
said,
are
immediately
church-related
and
the
lower
court
expressly
found
that
they
were
church-related.
the
lower
court
also
found
that
their
predominant
mission
is
the
functioning
as
a
secular
educational
institution.
the
lower
court
also
found
that
all
of
the
schools
have
secondary
objectives;
the
encouragement
of
spiritual
development
of
the
students.
this
finding
as
to
secondary
objective
is
plainly
supported
by
the
record
and
by
the
school’s
own
perceptions
of
themselves.
for
example,
loyola
college
expressly
identifies
itself
with
the
catholic
and
jesuit
tradition.
the
other
appellees
have
similar
expressions
of
identification.
this
court’s
decisions
have
furnished
us
with
a
three-fold
framework
of
analysis
in
establishment
clause
questions.
in
order
for
a
statute
to
survive
an
establishment
clause
challenge,
it
must
have
a
secular
legislative
purpose,
its
principle
or
primary
effect
must
neither
advance
nor
inhabit
religion,
and
the
statute
must
not
foster
excessive
government
entanglement
with
religion.
the
appellants
here,
as
below,
offer
no
challenge
as
to
the
secular
legislative
purpose
of
the
statute.
however,
the
appellants
do
challenge
the
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it
promotes
excessive
government
entanglement
with
religion
and
that
its
primary
effect
is
to
advance
religion.
i
would
like
to
first
turn
to
the
issue
of
entanglement,
and
running
through
any
analysis
of
entanglement
according
to
this
court
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
a
settlement
was
reached
between
western
maryland
college
and
the
appellants.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
western
maryland
college,
your
honor,
through
the
litigation
had
taken
the
position
that
it
was
not
a
church-related
college.
yet,
the
lower
court
plainly
found
that
at
least
certain
vestiges
of
church-relatedness
remained.
the
settlement
was
predicated
upon
the
removal
by
western
maryland
college
of
even
these
vestiges
of
church-relatedness.
the
appellants
agreed
to
dismiss
the
appeal
provided
western
maryland
would
remove
the
vestiges
of
church-relatedness.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
can
describe
some
of
them,
your
honor.
these
included
religious
symbols
on
the
facades
of
buildings
and
inside
some
of
the
buildings.
western
maryland
college
agreed
to
remove
them.
these
included
the
financial
support
of
a
certain
council
which
operated
for
religious
purposes
within
western
maryland
college.
financial
support
was
not
a
major
item,
but
it
was
there
and
western
maryland
agreed
not
to
support
it.
it
included
a
direct
tie-in
to
the
sponsoring
church
and
the
furnishing
of
certain
reports
to
that
church.
it
agreed
to
remove
this.
it
included
a
department
of
philosophy
and
religion
in
which
all
of
the
teachers
were
clerics
of
the
sponsoring
order
and
it
agreed
with
the
normal
attrition
applicable
to
these
individuals
such
as
through
retirement
or
illness
or
death
or
whatnot
to
replace
them
so
that
the
makeup
of
that
department
would
not
be
all
clerics
sponsoring
faith.
i
do
not
recall
other
specific
instances,
but
the
settlement
agreement
also
included
a
general
provision
that
western
maryland
college
would
remain
totally
neutral
as
to
the
furtherance
of
spiritual
development
of
its
students.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
your
honor,
i
do
not
recall
whether
western
maryland
college
gave
degrees
in
theology.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
they
had
a
department,
your
honor,
of
philosophy
and
religion
which
included
certain
religion
courses.
they
took
the
position
throughout
the
litigation
that
these
religion
courses
were
taught
in
a
strictly
academic
manner,
and
they
agreed
that
any
religion
courses
they
had
would
continue
to
be
taught
in
an
academic
manner.
i
do
not
know
that
they
had
a
major
in
theology.
i
just
do
not
recall
that.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
if
i
accept
it
for
purposes
of
the
settlement,
i
would
have
accepted
that,
yes.
i
would
point
out,
mr.
justice
white,
that
i
would
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
academic
teaching
of
theology
and
non-academic
teaching
of
theology.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
they
claim
to
a
very
serious
question
about
that
and,
as
the
lower
court
expressly
did
not
find,
it
was
unable
to
characterize
exactly
how
theology
was
taught
at
these
schools.
theology
was
theory
which
i
think
gave
the
lower
court
the
most
difficulty.
turning
ahead
to
the
issue
of
entanglement,
running
through
the
entanglement
analysis
is
the
concept
that
it
is
not
necessarily
actual
entanglement
which
requires
the
statute
to
be
struck
down
on
establishment
clause
grounds.
potential
entanglement
will
suffice.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct.
there
must
be
excessive
entanglement.
this
court’s
decisions
teach
us
that
an
analysis
of
excessive
entanglement
necessarily
involves
an
equation
with
three
variables.
the
three
variables
are
the
character
and
purpose
of
the
institution,
the
nature
of
the
aid,
and
the
resulting
relationship
between
the
church
and
state.
this
court’s
decisions
also
teach
us
that
these
variables
are
to
be
judged
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
in
the
final
analysis
it
is
the
cumulative
effect
of
these
variables
in
any
given
case
which
determines
whether
or
not
the
statute
at
issue
is
constitutional.
turning
to
the
first
variable,
the
character
and
purposes
of
the
institution,
the
lower
court
expressly
held
that
the
schools
here
confirmed
in
character
and
purposes
to
those
schools
which
were
approved
for
aid
in
tilton
versus
richardson
in
1971.
however,
running
through
its
opinion,
are,
i
submit,
two
distinctions
between
these
schools
and
the
tilton
schools.
in
tilton,
this
court
employed
as
a
foundation
the
absence
of
any
restriction
based
upon
religion,
upon
faculty
appointments.
in
respect
of
these
schools,
the
lower
court
expressly
found
that
there
was
a
policy
or
practice
at
least
in
part
of
faculty
recruitment
based
upon
religion.
more
specifically,
loyola
college
admittedly,
and
as
the
lower
court
found,
has
the
policy
of
attempting
to
recruit
to
its
faculty
each
year
two
members
of
the
sisters
of
mercy
and
two
members
of
the
society
of
jesus,
both
of
which
are
sponsoring
religious
orders.
that
is
not
to
say
that
if
loyola
is
unable
to
find
members
who
are
qualified,
they
will
not
turn
to
people
of
other
religions
and
hire
them.
they
will.
nonetheless,
their
affirmative
policy
is
to
recruit
members
of
these
religious
orders
and,
it
is
appellants’
contention
that
to
the
extent
loyola
or
any
other
school
has
a
policy
of
recruitment
at
least
in
part
based
upon
religion,
it
necessarily
has
the
corollary
policy
of
not
recruiting
people
from
other
religious
backgrounds
and
those
of
the
sponsoring
order.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
do
not
know
the
exact
percentage.
this
information
was
unavailable
at
trial.
of
course,
as
i
recall,
records
of
each
particular
individual’s
religion
simply
were
not
kept.
there
were,
as
i
recall,
approximately
20-25%
of
the
faculty
members
who
were
either
roman
catholic
priests
or
members
of
the
sisters
of
mercy.
this
information
was
available
since
the
catalogs
identified
by
certain
symbols,
members
of
these
religious
orders.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
the
record
shows
that
some
were
so-dressed
and
others
were
not.
this
was
something
that
was
left
up
to
the
particular
teachers.
similarly,
some
wore
religious
symbols
such
as
crosses
and
some
did
not.
similarly,
some
classrooms
had
in
them
crucifixes
or
other
religious
symbols
and
some
did
not
and,
i
do
not
know
the
precise
numbers.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
i
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
am
able
to
state
that
approximately
20-25%
of
the
faculty
included
members
of
either
the
society
of
jesus
or
other
roman
catholic
priests.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
no,
sir.
i
am
talking
now
of
loyola
college.
the
percentages
did
vary.
the
percentages
were
greater
in
st.
joseph
college
and
i
have
forgotten
exactly
what
the
percentage
were,
but
it
was
something
like
60
or
70%
of
the
teaching
faculty
which
was
made
up
of
members
of
the
sponsoring
religious
order,
the
daughters
of
charity.
and
the
college
of
notre
dame
and
mt.
st.
mary’s
college
had
percentages,
as
i
recall,
which
were
in
between
that
is
of
clergy.
what
i
said
i
did
not
know
was
the
number
of
faculty
which
were
catholic
as
opposed
to
some
other
religion,
that,
i
am
not
able
to
identify
at
all.
now,
the
college
of
notre
dame
and
st.
joseph
college,
as
the
lower
court
found,
also
have
practices
of
recruiting
faculty
based
upon
religion.
the
lower
court
found
that
reason
for
this
was
budgetary.
that
is,
that
it
involves
less
expense
to
the
schools
involved
to
invite
and
receive
through
their
faculties,
members
of
these
religious
orders
than
independent
persons
and
that
was
the
reason
for
that.
there
is
another
major
distinction
between
these
institutions
and
those
which
were
involved
in
the
tilton
versus
richardson.
in
tilton,
this
court
pointed
out
that
theology
was
taught
academically.
this
was
based
upon
a
stipulation
by
the
parties
to
tilton
that
theology
was
in
fact
taught
academically.
there
was
no
such
stipulation
in
this
case.
as
i
have
indicated
earlier,
the
court
had
considerable
difficulty
with
the
whole
question
of
theology.
it
found
itself
unable
to
characterize
one
way
or
the
other
whether
theology
was
taught
academically
or
religiously.
however,
it
did
recognize
that
given
the
limited
selection
of
courses
at
these
schools
and
given
that
this
limited
selection
was
focused
upon
christianity
and
given
that
the
courses
were
taught
by
maryland,
and
in
some
cases,
exclusively
by
clerics
of
the
sponsoring
faith,
there
existed
at
least
the
potential
that
theology
could
be
used
to
further
the
secondary
purpose
of
these
institutions,
that
is,
the
religious
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
can
only
reply
in
the
most
general
terms,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
when
you
teach
about
religion,
that
is
when
you
teach
that
at
a
certain
age
certain
people
believe
x,
y,
and
z,
and
similarly,
other
people
believe
a,
b,
and
c.
in
other
words,
you
teach
the
historical
evolution
and
you
teach
the
modern
day
beliefs
of
people.
that
is
teaching
about
religion,
that
is
academically.
however,
when
you
purport
to
teach
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
at
a
given
time
the
messiah
had
come
and
that
a
certain
person,
jesus
christ,
was
the
messiah
and
that
all
members
of
the
roman
catholic
church
in
order
to
save
their
souls
must
believe
these
things.
that
is
teaching
religiously.
now,
obviously,
there
are
all
sorts
of
shades
of
grey
which
one
could
interpose,
but
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
distinction.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
think
he
is.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
the
dissection
of
a
frog
is
the
clearest
example
i
can
think
of
for
the
academic
teaching
of
theology.
as
i
have
indicated,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
many
shades
of
grey
in
here.
i
think
what
you
say
is
correct,
that
a
teacher
can
teach
a
view
is,
b
view
is,
my
preference
is
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
academic
teaching
of
theology.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
would
say
so.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
think
that
is
correct,
but,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
that
is
right
and
that
is
the
key.
the
inculcation
of
specific
theological
tenants
is
i
think,
largely
a
matter
of
degree.
it
can
be
done
extremely
subtly.
it
does
not
have
to
be
done
as
blatantly
as
i
just
described
and
so
in
a
continued
emphasis
in
a
theology
class
about
the
professor’s
own
individual
beliefs,
it
happens
to
coincide
with
the
beliefs
of
the
sponsoring
order,
you
at
least
have
the
potential
that
the
line
or
the
wall
of
separation
will
be
abridged
in
that
course
and
it
is
that
potential
against
which
the
establishment
clause
must
guard.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
would
say
that
the
guidance
from
this
court’s
decisions
is
today
unclear.
in
hunt
versus
mcnair,
this
court
referred
to
a
sectarian
institution
as
one
in
which
religion
is
so
pervasive
that
in
effect,
its
secular
and
religious
functions
merged,
the
one
is
subsumed
with
the
other.
that,
in
general
terms,
given
the
guidance
of
hunt
versus
mcnair,
is
how
i
would
describe
the
sectarian
institution.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
pardon
me?
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
did
so
contend,
but
the
lower
court
expressly
ruled
that
these
schools
were
not
pervasively
sectarian.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes,
i
am
and
i
propose
to
identify
three
specific
factors,
any
one
of
which,
i
submit,
place
these
schools
in
the
pervasively
sectarian
category.
i
can
do
so
right
now
in
response
to
your
question
if
you
like.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
it
is
my
understanding
that,
from
a
historical
point
of
view
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
one
time
they
were.
whether
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
if
given
schools
have
vestiges
of
church-relatedness
then
sure,
they
are,
but
i
would
point
out
that
that
in
itself
does
not
really
answer
any
question
dealing
with
the
establishment
clause
because,
as
this
court
has
taught
us,
it
is
the
degree
of
church-relatedness
which
is
an
important
factor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
would
say,
yes.
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
one
exception.
i
think
that
there
are
certain
factors
which
may
be
applicable
to
a
church-related
school
which
in
and
off
themselves
would
disqualify
those
schools
from
aid.
one
of
the
factors
which
i
think
is
present
in
this
case
is
the
introduction
of
prayer
into
the
classroom.
why
do
i
think
this
is
important?
the
entire
premise
upon
which
this
court
in
the
past
has
permitted
state
aid
or
federal
aid
to
church-related
institutions
is
that
the
religious
functions
are
separable
from
the
so-called
secular
functions.
with
respect
to
private
colleges,
the
secular
function
at
bottom
is
the
classroom
teaching
of
given
subjects.
i
submit
that
there
is
no
more
cogent
way
to
mingle
the
religious
into
this
secular
educational
function
than
by
introducing
prayer
into
the
class.
now,
in
fact,
each
of
the
appellees,
as
the
lower
court
found,
had
a
practice
of
prayer
in
the
class.
the
lower
court
found
this
practice
to
be
what
the
lower
court
termed
“peripheral”
to
the
teaching
of
the
various
subjects.
however,
prayer
was
introduced
by
the
teachers
in
a
wide
variety
of
courses.
for
example,
chemistry,
mathematics,
business
administration,
physics,
not
to
leave
out
of
course
philosophy
and
theology.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
no,
sir,
it
was
not
the
school’s
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
exactly.
it
was
regarded
as
a
facet
of
the
teacher’s
academic
freedom.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
right.
the
students
were
not
required
to
state
prayer.
the
fact
is
that
many
did,
but
many
others
did
not.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well
that
too,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
very
difficult
to
answer
and
i
can
only
answer
it
this
way.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct
and,
to
directly
respond
to
your
question,
i
would
say
that
if
harvard
did
so
permit
a
prayer
in
a
classroom,
it
should
not
receive
the
state
aid.
now,
the
question
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
as
i
have
answered
before,
i
think
it
should.
but
the
question
which
i
think
has
to
be
answered
--
first,
you
do
not
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
here,
you
do
not
have
one
instance
of
a
prayer
in
a
biology
class.
you
have
instances
of
prayer
ranging
from
67
courses
roughly
at
loyola
college
which
meant
68%
of
the
courses
to
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
courses
at
st.
joseph
college,
something
like
70%
of
the
courses.
i
acknowledge
that
it
may
be
possible
to
draw
lines
and
i
am
frankly
at
a
loss
as
to
where
to
draw
them.
perhaps
one
can
say
that
your
particular
biology
class,
mr.
justice
stewart,
should
not
receive
the
aid
or
perhaps
the
biology
department
should
not
receive
the
aid,
or
perhaps
the
department
of
physical
sciences
should
not
receive
the
aid.
i
frankly
do
not
know
where
to
draw
the
line.
the
litmus
paper
test,
which
i
think
makes
it
easy
as
to
where
to
draw
the
line,
is
simply
to
avoid
prayer.
the
point
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
i
would
say
that
is
different
than
prayer.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
pardon
me?
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
because
prayer,
by
its
very
nature,
is
religious.
it
seems
to
me
religious
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
understand
it
is
protected
constitutionally,
but
i
do
not
think
it
arises
to
the
same
degree
of
prayer.
prayer
by
its
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
think
that,
under
certain
circumstances,
tax
funds
could
be
so
used.
if
it
were
clear,
as
in
tilton
for
example
the
party
stipulated
that
the
teaching
of
atheism
was
strictly
academic,
that
arguably
would
be
a
secular
educational
function
of
the
institute
and
under
this
court’s
decisions,
it
could
be
supported
by
tax
aid.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
making
that
distinction.
we
just
like
to
offer
that
this
court
in
tilton
had
in
one
of
its
touchstones,
the
absence
of
worship
which,
i
assume,
includes
prayer
in
a
classroom
from
the
types
of
facilities
which
were
there,
permitted.
i
would
like
to
turn
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct.
it
did
strike
down
that
enforcement
provision
of
the
higher
education
facilities
act
in
tilton.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes,
sir.
another,
i
submit,
is
the
recruitment
of
faculty
based
upon
religion.
this
too,
i
submit,
strikes
at
the
heart
of
this
court’s
premise
for
allowing
public
aid
to
church-related
schools
which
is
that
the
secular
functions
and
the
religious
functions
are
separable.
when
you
recruit
or
even
have
a
policy
to
recruit
faculty
based
upon
religion,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
necessarily
strike
at
the
heart
of
that
premise,
even
though
the
policy
is
partial,
even
though
there
are
exemptions,
and
it
does
not
extend
to
the
entire
faculty
recruitment
practices
at
the
school.
the
third
litmus
paper
test,
mr.
justice
stevens,
relates
to
the
granting
of
scholarships.
i
would
say
that
where
an
institution
such
as
the
college
of
notre
dame
in
this
case
base
these
scholarships
at
least
in
part
upon
religion,
that
too
strikes
at
the
heart
of
this
court’s
premise
that
the
religious
functions
of
an
institution
and
academic
functions
are
separable.
the
fact
is
that
the
college
of
notre
dame
here
automatically
awards
scholarships
to
teachers
of
catholic
parochial
schools
and
some
members
of
the
school
sisters
of
notre
dame
which
is
the
sponsoring
religious
order.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may,
focus
upon
one
or
two
critical
points
of
the
appellants’
case
here.
first,
it
relates
to
the
nature
of
the
aid.
the
lower
court
specifically
held
that
the
difference
between
the
so-called
general
purpose
grants,
as
are
involved
in
this
case,
and
special
purpose
grants,
as
were
involved
in
tilton
versus
richardson,
are
constitutionally
insignificant,
but
only
point
out
that
no
prior
case
decided
by
this
court
involved
aid
in
such
a
broad
form
as
is
offered
by
the
state
of
maryland.
in
fact,
even
the
aid
which
this
court
has
struck
down
was
far
more
limited
by
its
very
nature
than
that
aid
permitted
by
the
state
of
maryland.
the
basic
distinction
offered
by
this
court
is
that
secular,
neutral,
or
non-ideological
services,
facilities,
and
supplies
may
under
certain
circumstances
be
permissible.
however,
aid
which
at
least
potentially,
involves
the
danger
of
fostering
religion
is
not.
the
distinction
at
the
bottom
is
between
aid
which
is
atmospherically
indifferent
on
the
score
of
religion,
in
professor
frewin’s
(ph)
words,
from
aid
which
potentially
foster
this
religion.
maryland,
insofar
as
it
may
extend
to
virtually
anything
under
the
sun,
short
of
so-called
sectarian
purposes
to
which
the
school
wants
to
use
the
aid
is
necessarily
too
broad.
now,
the
resulting
relationship
is
the
third
problem
of
the
excessive
entanglement
analysis.
basically,
the
teaching
by
this
court
is
that
guarantees
which
are
comprehensive
and
continuing
will
create
an
aura
of
excessive
entanglement
and
so
in
this
case,
contrary
to
tilton
and
richardson,
you
have
annual
appropriations
and
annual
payments
of
the
state
to
the
church-related
institution.
contrary
to
tilton
versus
richardson,
you
have
at
least
two
reports,
the
pre-expenditure
report
and
the
post
expenditure
report,
submitted
by
the
school
to
the
church-related
institution.
contrary
to
tilton,
the
state
analyzes
each
of
these
reports
each
year
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
expenditure
was
religious
or
secular.
contrary
to
tilton,
the
schools
here
have
their
expenditures
subjected
to
annual
audit.
contrary
to
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
information
is
furnished
to
the
maryland
council
of
higher
education
dealing
with
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
i
do
not
know
if
it
specifically
deals
with
the
proper
amount
of
reading,
writing,
and
arithmetic,
but
a
vast
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
in
order
to
become
a
creditor,
yes
sir,
they
do.
and,
information
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
from
the
reports,
i
read
about
maryland
schools.
i
am
not
so
sure
that
they
do,
but
there
are
at
least
minimal
standards
which
are
observed
by
the
state
through
the
collection
of
information
from
these
church-related
institutions.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
no,
not
at
all
but
it
is
the
degree
of
surveillance,
your
honor,
which
i
submit
is
dispositive
of
these
issues.
the
surveillance
here,
i
submit,
involves
precisely
those
kinds
of
surveillance
struck
down
in
lemon
versus
kurtzman
and
those
kinds
of
surveillance
upon
which
the
court
in
tilton
distinguished
lemon
versus
kurtzman.
in
tilton,
you
had
a
one-time
single
purpose
construction
grant.
this
was
an
important
corner
stone
of
the
court’s
decision.
here,
under
the
maryland
aid,
you
have
no
such
thing
and
that
is
what
creates
excessive
entanglement.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
undefined,
your
honor,
both
in
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
there
has
been
no
practice
of
audits.
there
was,
however,
testimony
and
the
lower
court
found
that
the
audits
would
be
quick
and
non-judgmental.
that
is
a
good
question.
i
submit
that
if
an
audit
is
non-judgmental,
it
cannot
very
well
be
very
much
good
to
enable
the
states
to
enforce
its
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
it
is
performed
at
the
behest
of
the
maryland
council
of
higher
education
which
i
believe
contacts
the
state
auditor’s
office
to
perform
the
function.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
i
do
not
know
specifically
how
many
people
would
perform
it,
but
i
do
know
that
an
analysis
of
the
sectarian
as
opposed
to
a
secular
use
would
be
made
perpetually
by
the
council
for
higher
education
of
the
state
of
maryland.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes,
i
think
it
is
significantly
different,
your
honor,
because
here,
under
this
aid
program,
the
state
expressly
analyzes
religious
use
of
aid
funds
as
opposed
to
secular
use
and
this
is
a
rather
involved
sort
of
analysis.
it
is
a
continuing
sort
of
analysis,
both
of
which
are
diametrically
opposed
to
the
type
of
analyses
which
were
required
in
tilton
versus
richardson.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
no,
sir.
again,
entanglement
is
really
an
equation
with
the
three
variables.
i
am
contending
that
the
cumulative
effect
of;
one,
the
character
and
the
purposes
of
the
institution;
two,
the
broadest
possible
nature
of
the
aid
here
and
three,
the
prophylactic
measures
which
have
to
be
taken
in
order
to
enforce
the
ban
against
sectarian
use
together
cumulatively.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
there
is
an
annual
appropriation,
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
well,
that
leads
to
the
question
of
a
so-called
political
entanglement.
there
is
a
potential
for
political
entanglement
and
the
record
shows
that
at
least
one
president
of
one
institution
here
who
is
a
roman
catholic
priest
has
been
on
the
political
scene
advocating
greater
state
aid
to
these
church-related
and
other
private
schools.
i
would
like
to
close,
if
i
may,
since
my
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
do
not
think
the
record
addresses
it
in
those
terms.
however,
the
regulations
which
are
applicable
to
both
church-related
and
non-church-related
schools
provide
for
necessary
follow-up,
including
void.
so,
i
would
say
an
order
could
be
applied
to
these
other
schools.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
the
regulations
do
not
mandate
that
there
would
be
an
order.
they
make
it
available
under
subject
to
order.
in
tilton
versus
richardson,
this
court,
for
the
first
time,
permitted
a
payment
of
direct
aid
to
church-related
institutions.
it
did
so
under
expressed
narrow
constraints
and
later
cases
have
upheld
the
narrowness
of
these
constraints.
appellants
would
urge
the
court
not
to
effectively
abandon
these
restraints
because
to
do
so
would
breach
jefferson’s
wall
of
separation,
and
we
submit
would
be
an
unconstitutional
establishment
of
religion.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
that
is
correct.
the
plaintiffs
here
have
the
burden
of
proof,
one
which
i
would
submit,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
has
been
satisfied
both
by
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
by
the
rather
large
trial
record.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
that
one
minute,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
question
earlier
asked
by
the
court,
that
is,
the
number
of
clergy
in
the
respective
schools.
i
believe
the
record
indicates
that,
at
loyola,
approximately
25%
of
the
administration
and
faculty
are
clerics.
at
mt.
st.
mary’s,
approximately
20%
of
the
teaching
faculty
are
clerics
in
the
college
and
80%
in
the
seminary.
again,
mt.
st.
mary’s
college
is
a
corporation
operating
both
a
seminary
for
the
training
of
roman
catholic
priests
and
a
liberal
arts
college.
in
notre
dame
the
figure
is
50%.
st.
joseph
college,
the
figure
is
approximately
two-thirds
of
the
teaching
faculty.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes,
sir?
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know.
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
i
do
not
know
that
either,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
not
in
the
context
of
the
number
of
clergy
which
belonged
to
the
faculty.
these
percentages
apply
to
clergy
on
the
faculty,
not
to
catholics
on
the
faculty,
your
honor.
and
so
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
greenwald
yes,
it
would
have.
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
