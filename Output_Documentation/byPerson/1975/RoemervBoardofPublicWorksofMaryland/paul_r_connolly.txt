mr.
paul
r.
connolly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
role
of
colleges,
insofar
as
the
future
is
concerned
in
this
case,
is
reduced
now
to
three.
as
was
disclosed
this
morning
before
lunch,
western
maryland
college
which
was
the
methodist
church-related
college
has
settled,
one
of
the
four
catholic
colleges
is
now
in
the
process
of
liquidation.
so,
if
we
speak
to
the
future,
we
have
merely
three
appellees:
loyola
college
of
baltimore,
mt.
st.
mary’s
college
of
emmitsburg,
maryland,
and
notre
dame
of
maryland
which
is
predominantly
a
women’s
college
in
baltimore.
if
it
would
please
the
court,
i
think
that
the
plaintiffs’
case
here
has
two
main
failures.
one,
his
entire
brief
and
largely
his
argument
this
morning,
except
in
response
to
questions
of
mr.
justice
blackmun
failed
to
distinguish
between
the
types
of
school
systems
who
were
the
beneficiaries
of
state
aid.
this
court,
in
the
last
five
years,
has
written
opinions
in
eight
cases
with
respect
to
governmental
attempts
to
provide
aid
to
private
school
systems.
in
six
of
those
cases,
it
has
found
aid
in
all
its
forms
impermissible.
every
one
of
those
cases
showed
as
a
fact
that
the
beneficiaries
of
that
aid
were
large
parochial
school
systems
which
the
district
court,
in
dissent,
so
found
to
be
an
integral
part
of
the
religious
mission
of
the
catholic
church
and
in
nay
question
found
that
they
practiced
restrictions
on
admissions,
restrictions
on
faculty
hiring,
that
they
were
under
the
control
of
the
governing
bishop
of
the
community.
these
colleges
are
not,
these
are
independent
schools.
they
respond
to
no
ecclesiastical
authority.
the
evidence
is
clear
with
respect
to
this.
the
second
thing
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
do,
is
they
largely
ignore
the
very
detailed
findings
of
fact
which
were
made
in
the
district
court.
this
was
not
a
case
that
come
to
this
court
on
abbreviated
record.
the
plaintiffs
used
the
full
panoply
of
the
discovery
powers
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
hearings
were
conducted
over
a
six-week
period
of
time.
over
2,000
pages
of
testimony
were
taken.
proposed
findings
of
fact
were
submitted.
the
district
judge
assigned
to
gather
the
facts
published
tentative
findings
of
fact,
heard
arguments
again,
and
then
made
the
findings
of
the
fact
which
were
adapted
by
the
three-judge
court,
including
the
dissenter.
so,
we
have
had
plenty
of
due
process
insofar
as
fact
finding
is
concerned
and
if
rule
52
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
had
any
meaning,
i
think
it
should
mean
that
these
findings
should
be
respected
on
appeal
unless
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous
and
i
think
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
do
that
before
this
court
or
in
the
briefs
and
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
and
mr.
greenwald
agreed
with
it,
there
was
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiffs
to
carry
their
burden
of
proof.
i
think
it
is
instructive,
if
we
remember
that
this
court’s
plurality
opinion,
which
i
think
has
become
the
majority
opinion
in
hunt,
developed
several
criteria
for
testing
whether
or
not
the
schools
which
were
the
beneficiaries
of
the
federal
aid
program
in
tilton
were
pervasively
sectarian
or
had
a
predominant
secular
mission.
and
these,
gentlemen,
are
the
findings
of
the
district
court
with
respect
to
these
colleges.
one;
not
only
has
there
been
no
showing
that
religion
slants
the
conduct
of
classes
at
the
defendant
institutions.
this
litigation
has
demonstrated
the
opposite
to
be
true.
two;
none
of
these
facts,
respecting
prayer,
impairs
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
courses
at
each
defendant
institution
are
taught
according
to
the
academic
requirements
intrinsic
to
the
subject
matter
and
the
individual
teacher’s
concept
of
professional
standard.
three;
there
was
potent
evidence,
in
the
court’s
words,
of
academic
secularity
in
the
uncontroverted
testimony
of
numerous
members
of
the
faculty
of
each
defendant.
they
feel
no
religious
pressures
by
anyone.
on
their
classroom
presentation
or
their
selection
of
text
and
course
materials,
each
defendant
subscribes
to
the
1940
statement
of
principles
of
academic
freedom,
the
american
association
of
university
professors,
and
each
obviously
abides
by
it.
four;
while
the
district
court
did
not
make
any
finding
as
to
the
student
attitude,
there
was
no
evidence
to
contradict
the
tilton
observation
about
the
maturity
and
skepticism
of
the
average
college
student.
indeed,
there
was
much
testimony
supported.
one
of
the
professors
of
theology
said
“the
kind
of
questions,
if
you
want
to
meet
unbelievers,
come
and
talk
to
my
students.”
five;
the
court
said
thorough
analysis
of
the
student
admission
and
recruiting
criteria
of
each
defendant
demonstrates
the
student
bodies
are
chosen
without
regard
to
religion.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
question
--
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
i
believe
he
was
generally
questioning
everything.
he
was
talking
about
how
they
have
a
response
and
it
is
a
socratic
method
that
they
use
in
which
the
teacher
poses
propositions
student
response
and
he
was
saying
that
they
question
everything.
they
bring
a
healthy
questioning
attitude
and
skepticism
to
the
class,
that
is
what
he
was
talking
about
in
the
context
and
the
record
--
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
so
far
as
it
goes,
it
is
true.
let
me
tell
you
about
that.
first
of
all,
it
is
our
position
that
state
funds
cannot
be
used
for
scholarships
on
a
religious
bias.
what
the
evidence
shows
is
that
postulants
of
the
teaching
order
and
parochial
school
teachers
are
permitted
to
attend
notre
dame
at
a
reduced
rate.
it
is
not
an
absolute
scholarship.
it
is
a
tuition
forgiveness
program.
obviously,
since
that
is
a
test,
whether
that
should
be
a
parochial
school
teacher
or
you
would
be
a
member
of
the
sponsoring
religious
group,
these
state
funds
should
not
be
used
for
that
purpose,
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
ever
took
place.
the
only
school
that
ever
gave
the
scholarships
was
not
notre
dame
of
maryland,
but
it
was
loyola
college,
and
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
plaintiffs'
brief.
if
you
read
it
too
quickly
you
would
think
that
the
scholarship
program
is
the
scholarship
program
that
favored
members
of
religious
groups.
that
is
not
so.
again,
the
district
court
said
at
no
defendant
was
there
such
dominance
on
the
faculty
by
one
religious
group
that
hiring
bias
would
escape
the
attention
of
members
of
other
religious
groups.
the
faculty
members
impressed
the
court
as
professionals
who
value
academic
freedom
and
see
no
place
for
religious
bias
in
liberal
arts
education.
if
there
were
an
effort
to
stack
its
faculty
with
members
of
a
particular
religious
group,
it
could
not
have
escaped
the
attention
of
the
present
faculty
who
would
have
made
a
complaint
to
the
association,
local
chapter
of
the
association
of
university
professors.
questions
were
asked
this
morning
about
the
composition
of
the
faculty.
we
cannot
tell
with
respect
to
mt.
st.
mary’s
because
mt.
st.
mary’s
keeps
absolutely
no
records
whatsoever
that
would
identify
the
religion
of
its
faculty
members.
loyola
faculty,
of
its
full-time
faculty
60%
are
catholic,
and
of
its
part
time
faculty
50%
are
catholic,
and
the
overall
faculty
average
is
56%.
it
is
in
the
same
range,
although
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
the
figures
with
respect
to
the
other
college,
notre
dame.
the
district
court
continued
with
respect
to
these
colleges,
no
aspect
of
the
student
conduct
code
at
any
defendant
institution
has
any
religious
content.
none
of
the
defendants
require
attendance
at
any
religious
exercise.
finally,
that
none
of
the
defendants
is
religious
indoctrination
a
substantial
purpose
or
activity.
while
each
maintains
a
chaplaincy
program
which
serves
to
encourage
spiritual
development
of
the
students
which
is
admittedly
a
secondary
objective
of
this
defendant
has
not,
does
not
as
this
encouragement
go
beyond
providing
the
opportunities
for
occasions
for
religious
experience.
as
most
important
information
by
the
district
court,
because
the
plaintiffs’
brief
in
this
case
is
lauded
(ph)
with
references
that
the
secondary
objective
of
these
schools
is
to
provide
religious
encouragement
and
development
for
these
students.
my
friend
neglects
to
add
the
qualifying
language
made
with
the
district
court,
namely,
that
in
no
instance
does
this
go
beyond
making
religious
services
available
to
the
students
at
their
willingness
to
attend.
only
in
one
respect,
if
the
court
please,
do
the
district
court
findings
in
this
case
depart
from
tilton,
and
that
is,
with
respect
to
the
teaching
of
theology
and
religion.
in
the
tilton
case,
there
was
a
stipulation
which
i
think
will
be
impossible
to
be
obtain
in
the
future
because
the
prominence
that
the
observation
was
given
in
the
court’s
opinion.
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
theology
courses
of
the
four
connecticut
colleges
were
taught
as
an
academic
discipline
and
not
with
the
purpose
of
inculcating
religious
values.
no
such
stipulation
was
obtained
here.
extensive
evidence
was
taken
with
respect
to
it.
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
unable
to
determine
how
theology
was
taught.
that
determination
was
based
on
two
factors.
he
said
he
did
not
think
it
was
legally
permissible
for
him
to
make
such
a
determination,
perhaps
referring
to
this
court’s
prior
opinion
in
united
states
versus
ballard
where
this
court
should
not
interfere
with
theological
views
that
are
being
expressed
within
various
religious
bodies.
he
said
he
was
also
generally
unable
to
make
that
determination.
for
whatever
reason,
we
do
not
know
why
he
avoided
making
that
finding.
clearly,
he
made
a
specific
finding
that
he
was
not
making
a
finding
that
it
was
taught
in
a
sectarian
manner.
but
having,
as
many
district
judges
do,
an
ability
to
accommodate
their
judgments
to
the
practical
necessities
at
that
time,
the
fact
finding
judge
recommended
that
the
three-jude
court
ordered
that
theology
and
religion
courses
be
carved
out
of
the
state
program.
in
other
words,
it
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
program
providing
that
no
funds
were
used
to
support
the
departments
of
religion
and
theology.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
greenwald
had
a
colloquy
this
morning
about
how
theology
can
be
taught
academically.
it
may
be
a
difficult
question.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
district
court’s
finding
in
this
respect,
but
we
can
live
with
it.
it
certainly
is
a
nice
accommodation
to
the
entanglement
point.
it
obviates
a
necessity
for
any
class
monitors
sitting
in
a
class
of
religion
or
theology
if
you
cut
theology
and
the
religion
programs
out
of
the
course,
as
was
done
in
this
instance.
the
district
court
found,
as
a
conclusory
fact,
that
religious
indoctrination
is
not
a
purpose
of
these
institutions.
although
each
school
has
as
a
secondary
purpose,
the
encouragement
of
the
spiritual
development
of
the
students,
at
none
of
these
schools
does
this
encouragement
go
beyond
providing
opportunity
for
religious
experience.
the
religious
programs
at
each
school
are
separable
from
the
secular
programs
and
the
latter
are
the
only
beneficiaries
of
state
aid
that
led
the
district
court
immediately
to
the
next
point
of
the
opinion,
namely,
the
question
of
entanglement.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
i
certainly
do,
your
honor,
and
i
would
hope
that
most
of
the
private
colleges
of
this
country
also
have
a
secondary
objective
of
improving
the
spiritual
development
of
the
students
who
attend
those
schools.
the
question,
of
course,
is
whether
it
is
done
in
an
indoctrinating
way,
whether
these
institutions
become
pervasively
religious,
nothing
but
teaching
arms
of
the
church.
the
district
court
--
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
so
do
these
schools,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
yes,
your
honor.
so
do
these
schools.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
to
be
honest
about
it,
the
great
majority
of
them
are
catholic.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
i
am
not
sure
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
i
do
not
think
so.
loyola
college,
for
example,
has
a
jewish
rabbi
on
its
theology
faculty
and
who
counsels
with
jewish
students.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
students
of
one
of
the
rabbi’s
seminary
attend
(inaudible).
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
i
beg
you?
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
because
some
of
the
activities,
some
of
the
funds
of
these
schools
are
spent
for
frank
religious
activities.
all
of
them
have
chaplains.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
i
do
not
want
to
argue
that
case.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
that
is
true
and
it
may
be
that
someone
someday
will
bring
a
case
arguing
that
that
is
impermissible.
that
is
not
my
case
and
i
do
not
care
to
take
that
burden
at
the
moment.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
no,
your
honor,
but
we
have
a
key.
the
formula,
you
see,
for
payment
to
these
schools
is
15%
of
what
it
costs
the
state
of
maryland
to
keep
a
full-time
attendee
of
public
school.
so,
perhaps
the
private
colleges
can
be
operated
a
little
more
cheaply
than
the
state
schools,
but
that
gives
you
at
least
a
guide
at
any
rate.
i
was
arriving
at
the
entanglement
point.
by
virtue
of
those
findings,
the
district
court
said
because
of
the
nature
of
the
recipient
schools,
there
is
no
necessity
for
state
officials
to
investigate
the
conduct
of
particular
classes
or
educational
programs
to
determine
whether
a
school
is
attempting
to
indoctrinate
the
students
under
the
guise
of
secular
education.
now
that,
i
think,
is
quite
obvious
because
you
see,
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
the
plaintiffs
have
so
acidulously
avoided
talking
about
the
college
system
against
the
parochial
school
system
is,
again,
the
language
of
the
district
court
which
said
what
would
be
impermissible
at
an
institution
staff
by
members
of
a
particular
faith
administratively
controlled
by
a
religious
body
and
dedicated
to
the
inculcation
of
a
particular
faith
may
well
be
permissible
in
an
autonomous
institution
staffed
by
faculty,
hired
on
the
basis
of
academic
merit
where
academic
freedom
prevails
and
where
courses
are
taught
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
an
academic
discipline.
it
is
our
submission,
if
the
court
please,
that
despite
the
articulation
by
this
court
of
the
three-part
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
governmental
aid
programs
may
include,
among
their
beneficiaries,
church-related
schools
that
all
of
them
really
reduce
themselves
to
a
single
one.
what
is
the
basic
nature
of
the
institution
involved?
obviously,
as
the
questioning
brought
out
this
morning,
there
is
a
rather
extensive
relationship
between
state
and
schools,
not
only
in
the
state
of
maryland,
but
indeed,
in
every
state,
each
of
these
schools
must
pass
accreditation
procedures,
both
for
the
state
and
by
other
quasi
governmental
bodies.
indeed,
the
record
shows
in
this
very
case
in
alluding
to
the
prayer
issue
that
st.
joseph’s
college
was
actually
monitored
for
its
religious
content
by
a
state
accreditation
agency.
it
wanted
to
see
whether
the
nursing
school
there
was
sufficiently
a
professional
to
merit
accreditation,
and
they
sat
in
the
class
and
noticed
no
religious
content
in
the
subject
matter
that
was
taught.
at
any
rate,
there
is
an
extensive
relationship
that
goes
on
all
the
time
between
educational
institution
and
the
state
agencies.
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this,
if
these
institutions
are
educational
and
not
religious.
as
we
read
this
court's
prior
opinion,
the
excessive
entanglement
test
is
not
to
be
applied
just
because
an
institution
has
some
church
connection.
it
is
an
interference
with
the
religious
aspects
of
a
church-related
institution.
all
of
us
are
obviously
familiar
with
the
extensive
use
of
hill
burton
funds
that
goes
to
the
nation’s
hospitals,
many
of
which
are
run
by
sectarian
or
sectarian
in
nature.
there
is
an
ongoing
relationship
between
state
health
authorities,
state
certifying
authorities
in
that
institution.
it
is
not
the
fact
that
the
state
has
a
contact
with
a
religious
institution.
it
is
whether
the
state
has
a
contact
with
the
religious
aspects
of
that
institution
and
as
long
as
you
have
institutions
as
these
are
which
are
found
to
be
psychic,
which
are
found
to
have
a
religious
dichotomy
to
them
where
their
religious
aspects
are
separable
and
can
be
perceived
to
be
separate,
then
the
fact
that
the
state
has
some
oversight
with
respect
to
them
is
not
entanglement.
likewise,
when
we
--
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
i
think
not
and
i
think
if
your
honor
would
read
the
testimony
of
the
administrators
and
the
faculty
members
of
this
school,
you
will
see
that
they
were
churchmen
and
proud
of
it
and
they
did
not
attempt
at
all
to
modify
their
positions
and
they
made
very
clear
that
whatever
the
perception
was
in
the
past
that
no
longer
is
there
an
attempt
to
inculcate
religious
values
in
the
academic
aspects
here.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
no,
i
think
you
will
find
no
inhibitions
in
this
at
all.
there
is
one
example.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
one
bad
example
in
all
frankness,
and
that
is
the
settlement
that
was
made
by
western
maryland.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
that
stipulation
of
settlement
is
in
the
court’s
records
and
i
would
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
read
it.
i
cannot
imagine
trustees
entering
that
kind
of
stipulation,
but
they
did
it.
they
turned
over
the
administration
of
the
school
to
the
plaintiffs
and
that
is
unfortunate,
but
they
did
it
but
that
is
not
a
necessity,
especially
as
long
as
this
court
sits
and
could
look
at
the
record
that
was
made
in
this
court
and
apply
the
principles
which
we
say,
have
already
been
articulated
in
the
two
cases.
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
primary
effect,
again,
we
see
that
the
real
test
is
the
nature
of
the
institution.
aid
really
is
of
two
kinds.
some
aid
is
frankly
religious.
a
chapel,
a
chaplaincy
program,
religious
books
and
tracks,
these
schools
cannot
use
state
money
for
that,
but
neither
can
johns
hopkins,
or
hood,
or
washington
college,
nor
the
other
schools.
they
must
account
to
the
state
and
show
the
state
that
they
are
not
using
it
for
that
purpose.
other
aid,
however,
becomes
religious
or
assumes
a
religious
coloration
only
by
virtue
of
the
environment
in
which
it
is
placed.
and
then,
when
we
look
at
the
environment,
if
we
see
the
environment
is
a
predominantly
secular
one
where
the
inculcation
of
religious
values
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
institution
then,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
aid
then
becomes
neutral.
mr.
paul
r.
connolly
there
was
a
doctor
mcgill
who
was
called
as
a
witness
by
the
defendants
who
was
expert
educator.
he
is
one
of
the
officers
of
the
american
association
of
colleges
who
testified
to
the
practice
of
private
colleges
throughout
the
country
in
conducting
religious
programs
and
conducting
courses
in
religious
studies
and
theology.
interestingly
enough,
he
found
that
the
better
class
schools,
if
you
would
rate
them
on
the
carson
berimbau
(ph)
scale
of
selectivity
that
there
is
an
absolute
correlation
really
between
the
better
schools
and
those
that
have
religious
studies
and
theology
programs
in
them.
and,
he
testified
that
the
religious
programs
and
the
courses
in
theology
and
religious
studies
that
are
taught
at
these
schools
did
not
differ
at
all
from
those
of
the
great
majority
of
american
private
colleges
throughout
the
country.
this
is
a
program
that
has
a
bit
of
genius
in
it.
maryland
has
elected
to
give
a
general
purpose
grant
program.
of
course,
the
grant
is
not
general
once
it
is
issued.
the
school
must
make
application
for
it,
must
tell
what
it
is
for.
the
chief
executive
officer
must
take
an
oath
that
he
will
use
it
in
that
way
and
that
after
it
is
received
and
expended
he
must
take
an
oath
that
it
was
used
in
that
way.
the
maryland,
i
think,
has
done
a
better
job
than
most.
it
has
not
left
the
selectivity
of
aid
programs
to
the
legislature.
it
has
left
it
in
terms
of
the
ongoing
dialogue
which
takes
place
between
the
state
agency,
the
council
on
higher
education,
and
the
school
so
that
these
programs
can
be
flexible
and
can
meet
the
needs
of
the
individual
schools.
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
state
has
been
insensitive
to
administering
this.
we
now
have
a
set
of
written
rules
and
regulations
which
have
lately
been
filed
with
the
clerk
by
the
attorney
general’s
office.
i
commend
it
to
your
reading.
you
see
that
these
are
simple
rules,
easy
to
administer.
one
thing
i
think
needs
to
be
said
with
respect
to
audits.
the
schools
are
admonished
to
apply
what
is
called
fund
accounting.
fund
accounting
is
well-known
to
colleges
and
universities
because
colleges
and
universities,
for
years,
have
had
to
account
for
trust
funds
and
for
endowments.
they
need
to
have
funds
earmarked
for
specific
purposes.
the
state
admonishes
these
schools
to
treat
the
aid
funds
in
the
same
way
as
endowment
funds
and
to
leave
an
audit
trail
so
that
a
readily
identifiable
audit
can
be
shown
as
the
purpose
for
which
these
funds
were
used.
we
think
this
is
a
sensible
program.
it
is
starting.
there
has
been
no
showing
of
abuse.
we
think
it
is
responsible
and
responsive
to
the
needs
of
these
schools.
it
does
not
constitute
an
establishment
of
religion.
we
ask
that
this
court
give
it
a
chance
to
work.
thank
you.

mr.
