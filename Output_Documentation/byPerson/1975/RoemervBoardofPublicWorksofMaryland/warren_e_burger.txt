we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-730,
roemer
against
the
board
of
public
works.
mr.
greenwald.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
excessive,
not
merely
entanglement,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
word
that
is
involved
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it,
between
teaching
atheism,
advocating
it,
and
teaching
about
it,
is
that
where
you
draw
the
line?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
went
beyond
a
little,
did
it
not,
by
cutting
off
the
20-year
limitation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
in
effect,
it
could
not
be
converted
into
a
chapel
at
the
end
of
20
years
as
the
original
grant
conceivably
would
have
permitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
and
do
you
know
whether
in
maryland
the
annual
reports
of
church-related
schools
are
analyzed
to
see
if
they
are
teaching
proper
amount
of
reading,
writing,
arithmetic,
have
certain
hours,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
is
there
sort
of
an
audit
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
maryland
have
a
certain
minimum
requirements
as
to
what
a
practice
school
must
to
be
a
surrogate
for
the
public
school
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
try
to
determine
whether
they
are
teaching
children
to
read?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
in
fact,
there
is
the
surveillance
standing
alone
is
not
dispositive
of
these
issues,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
talking
about
something
different
from
the
process
of
surveillance
for
accreditation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
clients
were
the
moving
parties,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
it
is
on
them
as
to
the
burden
of
making
whatever
record
needs
to
be
made
to
determine
these
issues,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
nilson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
with
respect
to
funds
which
go
into
general
receipts
of
the
college
and
maybe
used
for
the
payroll
salaries
of
the
teachers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
subject
to
the
restraint
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now
it
would
be
subject
to
the
restraint
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
nilson,
none
of
these
funds
go
to
pay
any
part
of
the
salary
of
any
teacher
who
is
also
member
of
the
clergy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
district
court
opinion
you
referred
to
in
maryland,
i
assume
you
meant
the
federal
district
court,
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment,
if
there
was
a
prohibition
for
the
payment
of
salaries,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
they
do
rather
what
they
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
telling
us
that
maryland
does
have
a
surveillance
of
primary
and
secondary
schools
to
see
whether
they
are
teaching
the
minimum
number
of
hours
or
reading,
writing,
and
arithmetic,
etcetera?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
connolly,
we
will
not
ask
you
to
fragment
your
argument.
we
have
about
one
minute
left.
we
will
let
you
begin
at
1:00.
[lunch
break]
mr.
connolly,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
connolly,
how
would
you
interpret
that
response?
unbelievers
in
what
this
particular
professorâ€™s
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
theology
was
or
unbelievers
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
connolly,
are
you
suggesting
by
your
discussion
of
these
findings,
the
conclusions
that
were
drawn
from,
that
the
secondary
purpose
of
the
colleges
here
is
essentially
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
as
the
service
academies
of
the
united
states
government
in
west
point,
annapolis,
and
the
others
providing
a
chapel
and
chaplains?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
anyone
in
this
case
undertake
to
put
anything
in
the
record
by
way
of
either
contrast
or
comparison
with
the
institutions
like
american
university
which
is
frankly
and
openly
sponsored
by
the
methodist
church,
but
all
i
am
aware
of
is
not
the
kind
of
religious
institution
as
to
which
public
money
grants
are
barred?
was
there
anything
put
in
the
record
to
make
these
comparisons?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
one
minute
left,
mr.
greenwald.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
disposition
of
number
74-730,
roemer
against
the
board
of
public
works
of
maryland,
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.

you
