how
does
one
settle
a
case
such
as
this
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
state
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
greenwald,
what
is
the
difference
between
teaching
theology
academically
and
teaching
it
religiously?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
us
take
it
over
too.
suppose
it
is
a
philosophy
course
rather
than
a
religious
course,
and
the
professor
is
teaching
the
history
of
philosophy
and
he
happens
to
feel
that
kent
was
right
and
hume
was
wrong
and
his
notions
about
epistemology.
now,
i
take
it
that
in
a
normal
college
course
the
professor
is
perfectly
free
in
presenting
the
subject
objectively,
but
to
express
a
preference
for
one
or
the
other,
is
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
at
least
not
to
treat
them
completely
as
if
he
were
dissecting
a
frog,
the
way
you
describe
the
historical
teaching
of
religion
or
the
academic
treatment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
still
be
academic?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
clergyman
runs
for
congress?
do
you
think
there
is
anything
to
prevent
the
treasury
from
paying
his
salary
as
a
congressman?
