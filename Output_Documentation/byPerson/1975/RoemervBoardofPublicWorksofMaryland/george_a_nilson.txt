mr.
george
a.
nilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
maryland,
i
will
speak
to
the
history,
the
nature,
and
the
importance
of
the
maryland
aid
program
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
doing
so,
i
will
necessarily
deal
with
the
primary
effect
element
of
the
establishment
clause
as
well
as
the
counterweight
part
of
that
test,
the
requirement
for
the
state
to
avoid
excessive
entanglement
with
religion.
i
will
not
dealing
with
any
depth
with
the
particular
details
as
the
tilton
type
colleges
involved
in
this
case,
but
will
leave
that
to
mr.
connolly
who
represents
all
of
the
appellee
colleges
here.
he
will
use
the
remaining
30
minutes
of
our
time
to
discuss
in
depth
the
nature
and
character
of
these
colleges
and
the
importance
of
that
character
to
the
issues
presented,
and
to
speak
in
further
detail
to
the
primary
effect
and
entanglement
issues.
the
state
of
maryland
does
not
have
a
program
of
aid
to
private
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
the
grant
program
at
issue
here,
as
mr.
greenwald
has
pointed
out,
involves
aid
to
institutions
of
higher
learning.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
think
there
is
at
least
a
difference
in
a
way
church-related
institutions
that
operated
those
levels
have
dealt
with
the
education
of
students
in
the
two
different
environments
in
the
way
that
that
has
evolved.
i
think
there
is
also
a
significant
difference
wholly
apart
from
the
way
the
institutions
have
approached
it
because
of
the
age
and
the
maturity
and
the
intellectual
freedom,
the
sense
of
the
economic
freedom
on
the
part
of
the
student
bodies,
that
i
think
makes
the
two
backgrounds
and
the
two
settings
substantially
different
and
i
think
that
was
explicitly
recognized
in
this
court’s
plurality
opinion
in
tilton
and
later
in
the
opinion
in
hunt.
in
maryland,
less
than
one-third
of
the
institutions
receiving
aid
under
the
program
are
church-related
and
have
been
found
by
the
lower
court
to
conform
closely
to
the
colleges
considered
by
this
court
in
tilton
versus
richardson.
the
original
version
of
our
statute
was
passed
by
the
state
legislature
in
early
1971,
in
obvious
response
to
the
growing
financial
needs
of
private
colleges
and
universities.
in
establishing
a
grant
program
that
was
not
limited
to
one
particular
type
of
aid,
such
as
capital
grants
for
bricks
and
mortars,
but
rather
permit
flexibility.
the
state
was
codified
in
funding
a
sound
educational
policy
that
remains
extremely
important
to
the
state
as
well
as
the
colleges
today.
a
policy
which
recognizes
that
different
institutions
have
different
financial
needs
from
year
to
year
and
that
if
the
state
should
respond
to
those
needs
as
they
evolve
rather
than
locking
all
colleges
in
to
a
particular
type
of
aid
which
may
be
artificially
and
unsoundly
applied,
satisfy
contrive
rather
than
real
needs.
shortly
following
the
original
enactment
of
maryland’s
program
in
1971,
this
court
decided
tilton
v.
richardson,
upholding
the
federal
capital
facilities
grant
program
there
at
issue,
but
holding
that
any
funds
paid
to
such
colleges
were
constitutionally
required
to
be
paid
subject
to
an
explicit
and
permanent
prohibition
against
sectarian
usage.
maryland
responded
immediately
by
amending
its
statute
to
include
such
a
provision
and
by
conferring
certain
responsibilities
and
powers
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
our
program
upon
the
maryland
council
for
higher
education,
a
body
already
charged
with
substantial
responsibilities
and
information
gathering
functions
in
the
field
of
higher
education.
as
mr.
greenwald
has
mentioned
in
his
argument,
the
establishment
clause
in
cases
such
as
this
breaks
down
into
a
three-part
test.
secular
legislative
purpose
served
by
the
statute
about
which
there
is
no
question.
the
primary
effect
test
and
thirdly,
the
requirement
for
the
government
to
avoid
excessive
entanglement
with
religion.
there
is
an
inevitable
tension
between
the
primary
effect
and
the
excessive
entanglement
restriction.
a
tension
of
which,
we
submit,
the
state
and
the
maryland
council
are
very
much
aware.
in
essence,
it
is
necessary
for
the
state
to
avoid
the
payment
of
aid
to
a
sectarian
institution
or
to
assist
a
specifically
religious
activity
in
an
otherwise
secular
setting,
to
use
the
court’s
words
in
hunt,
and
to
do
so
without
involving
itself
in
an
excessively
entangling
relationship
with
religion,
where
a
school
is
pervasively
sectarian,
as
has
generally
been
the
case
with
the
primary
and
secondary
schools
which
have
been
before
the
court,
a
guarantee
of
no
advancement
of
religion
is
required
and
almost
invariably,
the
difficulty
of
separating
the
secular
from
the
sectarian
both
makes
it
impossible
to
avoid
aiding
religion
and
require
as
a
quantum
of
oversight
which
is
necessarily
excessively
entangling.
but
where
institutions
such
as
the
institutions
involved
in
this
case,
are
not
pervasively
sectarian
and
are
generally
characterized
by
strong
elements
of
academic
freedom
and
discipline
rather
than
religious
indoctrination,
limited
sectarian
activities
can
be
separated
from
the
dominant
secular
element
and
the
problems
of
avoiding
aid
to
the
sectarian
part
are
greatly
simplified.
this,
i
would
submit,
is
far
more
likely
to
occur
at
the
college
level.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
for
the
payroll
of
teachers,
the
maryland
council
presently
requires
that
any
institution
which
uses
funds
for
salaries
identify
the
area
of
the
institution
in
which
those
faculty
members
are
working.
following
the
district
court
opinions
below,
and
i
might
add
that
this
has
been
applied
not
only
with
respect
to
these
institutions,
but
also
with
respect
to
all
colleges
throughout
maryland,
no
payments
are
permitted
towards
the
salary
of
any
faculty
member
who
is
in
a
religion
or
theology
department.
if
an
institution
is
using
state
funds
to
pay
teachers
in
its
home
economics
department
that,
as
far
as
the
maryland
council
is
concerned,
is
perfectly
permissible,
but
it
would
not
be
permissible
for
the
institution
to
use
funds
for
a
teacher
in
a
religion
department.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
in
terms
of
percentages
of
faculty
members
at
these
particular
institutions
who
are
clerics,
the
percentages
vary
to
my
knowledge,
and
i
put
aside
the
first
year
of
the
program
because
as
i
indicated,
during
the
first
year
of
the
program
there
was
no
sectarian
usage
prohibition.
those
of
the
church-related
appellee
institutions,
to
my
knowledge,
have
never,
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
because
there
had
been
no
actual
experience
under
the
current
program,
but
none
of
the
appellee
institutions
have
ever
used
state
moneys
to
pay
other
than
the
lay
faculty.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
to,
again,
reiterate
that
the
posture
in
which
this
case
was
tried
below,
the
statute
had
operated
for
a
one-year
period
of
time
when
it
did
not
have
a
sectarian
usage
prohibition,
when
the
maryland
council
had
not
been
given
responsibilities.
the
statute
was
significantly
changed
at
the
end
of
that
one-year
period.
this
lawsuit
was
filed
at
the
time
that
statutory
change
was
pending
and
very
shortly
before
it
had
been
enacted
by
the
general
assembly.
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
state
voluntarily
determined
to
escrow
all
funds
that
were
being
awarded
to
these
appellee
colleges
and
those
funds
were
held
in
escrow
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case
before
the
district
court.
as
a
consequence,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
below
no
money
had
been
paid
by
the
state
of
maryland
under
this
aid
program
to,
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
any
church-related
college
and
certainly
not
to
any
of
these
colleges
so
that
the
record
is
simply
silent
on
that
question.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
all
of
this
money
going
to
clerics,
but
there
is
certainly
something
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
which
is
being
followed
by
the
state
which
would
prevent
this
money
from
going
to
pay
the
salary
of
faculty
members
teaching
in
the
religion
and
theology
departments,
and
that
prohibition
is
an
explicit
part
of
the
regulations
which
the
council
has
since
been
adapted.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
pardon
me?
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
the
restraint
of
the
statute
if
--
certainly,
based
on
the
findings
of
the
lower
court
which
is
that
these
courses
are
not
predominantly
sectarian
or
basically
academic
institutions
that
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
the
courses
anywhere
outside
of
the
religion
or
theology
departments
are
taught
in
other
than
a
purely
academic
fashion,
i
do
not
perceive
that
there
would
be
any
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
state
paying
the
salary
of
a
faculty
member
who
happened
to
be
teaching
in
the
school
of
business
and
administration.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
can
tell
you
that
i
do
not
believe
applications
have
been
made,
but
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
that
person
is
first
and
foremost,
based
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
a
teacher,
a
faculty
member
who
is
teaching
a
subject
in
an
academic
matter.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
said
was
that,
to
my
knowledge,
no
funds
have
been
devoted
to
that
purpose.
i
do
not
believe
that
any
applications,
and
this
is
because
the
applications
which
have
come
in
since
the
trial
in
this
case
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct,
as
far
as
the
lower
court’s
order
is
concerned.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
he
would
not
be
paid
for
holding
prayers,
mr.
justice
marshall.
he
would
be
paid
for
teaching.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
i
can
think
of
at
least
one
congressman
who
might
be
very
disturbed
at
the
present
time
if
that
were
the
case
and
i
know
that,
for
example,
the
state
of
maryland
has
a
provision
in
its
constitution
which
goes
back
many
years
which
prohibited
any
minister
or
clergymen
from
running
and
that
provision
was
recently
stricken
down
by
the
district
court
of
maryland
as
violating
the
constitution.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
absolutely,
if
a
clergyman
successfully
runs
for
congress
then
his
salary
can
be
paid
same
as
any
other
congressman.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct
so
long
as
none
of
them
are
serving,
and
this
i
am
reading
from
the
regulation,
serving
the
chaplain
or
director
of
the
campus
ministry
or
administers
or
supervises
any
program
of
religious
activities.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
right,
but
if
they
are
teaching
in
the
science
department
and
they
happen
to
be
clerics,
there
is
nothing
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
that
would
specifically
prohibit
their
salaries
from
being
paid.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
i
think
that
would
be
a
very,
very
strong
argument.
again,
these
individuals
are
serving
and
are
being
paid
as
teachers
and
the
result
of
applying
that
argument
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
exactly
correct
and
it
is
what
they
are
being
paid
for
and
they
are
being
paid
for
being
teachers
not
for
being
clerics.
they
simply
happen
to
be
clerics.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
always
possible,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
it
happens
with
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
it
is
a
difference
which
has
been
developed
by
this
court
and
articulated
in
walz,
and
hunt
versus
mcnair,
and
many
other
cases.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no,
but
the
court
very
clearly
indicated
in
walz
and
again
reiterated
in
hunt
and
as
in
other
cases
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
form
of
payment
to
a
secular
activity
of
a
religious
institution
freeze
up
other
moneys
for
that
institution
to
be
spent
for
other
purposes
which
may
be
religious
does
not
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
pardon
me?
mr.
george
a.
nilson
no,
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
has
ever
indicated
that
the
state
or
the
federal
government
could
simply
just
release
money
outright
to
a
religious
institution
or
to
these
colleges
with
no
strings
and
just
say
put
it
in
your
general
fund.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
this
grant
here
is
a
payment
of
funds
which
can
be
used
for
various
purposes,
but
which
may
not
be
used
for
sectarian
purposes.
it
may
not
be
used
to
build
a
chapel.
it
may
not
be
used
to
maintain
a
chapel.
it
may
not
be
used
to
pay
the
chaplain..
it
may
not,
according
to
the
district
court,
be
used
to
pay
the
salaries
of
faculty
members
in
the
religion
or
theology
department.
so,
it
is
a
restricted
grant
program
in
that
sense.
now,
a
number
of
questions
were
asked
earlier
during
mr.
greenwald’s
presentation
on
the
way
in
which
the
program
is
administered
and
i
would
like
to
just
touch
briefly
on
that.
as
mr.
greenwald
pointed
out,
following
initial
eligibility
determinations,
and
i
might
add
that
there
had
been
some
institutions
disqualified
on
a
degree
basis
otherwise
for
being
primarily
religious,
there
is
a
pre
and
post
expenditure
affidavit
requirement.
these
are
filed
under
oath
by
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
institution,
and
i
submit,
do
not
involve
the
state
in
any
excessive
entanglement.
the
council
has
large
amounts
of
detail
available
to
it
from
its
other
duties
in
the
process
of
analyzing
or
scrutinizing
these
reports
is
not
entangled.
the
audits
are
not
annual
audits.
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
they
had
never
been
performed.
the
lower
court
found
that
they
are
quick.
they
can
be
done
speedily
given
the
fund
accounting
system
that
is
set
up.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
well,
the
audits
would
only
come
into
play
if
the
state
had
reason
to
believe
that
a
particular
item
may
not
have
been
spent
for
what
it
was
described
as
being
spent
for
as
reported.
what
they
would
do
first,
and
the
testimony
indicates
that,
they
might
call
upon
the
institution
to
have
its
own
auditor
to
provide
a
report.
if
the
state
still
was
not
satisfied,
then
and
only
then
might
they
send
a
state
auditor
out
to
the
institution.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
he
would
go
out
and
he
would
analyze
the
special
revenue
fund
account
which
is
required
by
the
regulations
--
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct.
well,
certainly,
if
the
state
were
to
send
anybody
out
to
the
classrooms,
we
would
not
send
the
state
auditor.
we
could
send
somebody
else
out
and
we
of
course,
as
your
honor
indicated
by
questions
to
mr.
greenwald,
we
do
have
a
certification
and
accreditation
system.
we
do
have
periodic
reviews
of
these
institutions
generally.
in
other
areas
that
could
be
done.
the
council
is
very
much
aware
on
a
continuing
basis
of
the
nature
of
these
institutions
and
would
be
aware
of
any
change
in
emphasis.
mr.
george
a.
nilson
that
is
correct
and
we
have
to
be
kept
aware
of
what
is
going
on
with
the
private
colleges
all
the
time
because
we
have
to
plan
for
our
public
colleges.
so,
this
information
is
available
to
us.
again,
before
yielding
to
mr.
connolly,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
that
the
state
is
attempting
to
administer
a
reasonable
and
realistic
program.
it
has
demonstrated
sensitivity
to
the
first
amendment
issues
in
its
day
to
day
administration
of
the
program,
in
the
adaption
of
the
1972
amendments,
in
the
adaption
of
the
regulations.
we
urge
this
court
to
let
the
state
continue
to
give
money
to
these
colleges
and
others.
thank
you.
