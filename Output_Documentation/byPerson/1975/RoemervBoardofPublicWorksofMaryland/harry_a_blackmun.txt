those

approximated
some
of
the

might
not
that

have
some
significance?

it
has
some

not?

this
case
comes
to
us
from
a

federal
district
court
for
the

of
maryland,
and
we
are
asked
once
against
to
police

boundary
between

state.
in
a
situation
where
a
state
by
legislation
seeks
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
education
of
institutions,
including
those
that
are
affiliated
with
religious
denominations.
this
time
it
is
the
state
of
maryland,
that
is
endeavor
to
afford
relief
and
it
seeks
to
benefit
private
colleges
not
secondary
or
elementary
school.
the
statute
in
question
calls
for
annual
fiscal
year
grounds
that
are
subject
to
the
requirement
that
they
not
be
used
for
"sectarian

the
statute
requires
that
the
institution
be
accredited
by
the
state
department
of
education,
that
it
shall
have
been
established
in
maryland
before
july

that
had
maintained
one

and
that

amounts
to
about
15%
of
the
state's
per-full-time-pupil
appropriation
for
a
student
in
the
state
college
system.
the
statute
was
amended
in
1972,
to
provide
flatly
that
none
of
the
money
shall
be
utilized
by
the
benefit
against
institutions
for

the
administration
of
the
program
is
entrusted
to
the
maryland
board
of
public
works
assisted
by
the
maryland
council
for
higher
education.
and
during
each
of
the
challenge
years
in
question
1971
and
1972,
something
less
than
$2
million
was
dispersed
to
about
17
or
18
institutions.
and
others
amount
about
a
half
million
was
year
marked
to

the
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
who
are
appellants
here
are
four

they
sought
a
declaration
of

western
maryland,
however
has
since
been
dismissed
as
a
defendant
appellee
in
the
litigation.
the
district
court
by
divided
vote
ruled
that
the
amended
statute
was
constitutional,
and
that
injunctive
relief
was
not
in
order.
this
appeal
followed
and
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
members
of
this
court
are
not
uniform
in
their
views
as
is
often
the
case
in
recent
litigation
in
this
area.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
that
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
mr.
justice
powell.
and
in
that
opinion
we
endeavor
to
trace
the
recent
pertinent
decisions
and
we
conclude
that
under
those
decisions
and
the
standards
they
set
forth,
the
maryland
statute
and
system
does
past
constitutional
muster.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
he
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
he
would
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
would
enjoin
the
board
of
public
works
from
implementing
the
maryland
act.
and
would
require
the
appellee
institutions
to
refund
all
payments
made
to
them
under
the
act.
mr.
justice
marshall
joins
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
dissenting
from
the
judgment.
mr
