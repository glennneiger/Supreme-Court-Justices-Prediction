mr.
greenwald,
we
interrupted
you
already
in
your
thought,
is
there
a
distinction
between
a
school
which
is
church-related,
as
i
understand
it
these
schools
are
admitted
by
everyone
to
be
church-related,
and
being
sectarian?
do
those
terms
mean
different
things
and
if
so,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
schools
meet
that
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
contend
that
these
schools
would
satisfy
that
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
challenging
that
finding
on
appeal
either?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
greenwald,
before
you
go
back
to
your
argument,
would
you
tell
us
the
other
two
litmus
tests
of
the
sectarian
institution?
one
is
prayer
in
the
classroom.
what
were
the
other
two
that
you
said
was
shown
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
one
question,
mr.
greenwald.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
there
is
a
follow-up
audit
with
respect
to
the
14
schools
that
are
not
church-related?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
regulation
contemplate
that
it
will
be
(inaudible)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
possible
that
the
payment
to
these
teachers
freeze
up
other
funds
for
paying
the
people
who
teach
religion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
difference
whether
they
go
into
general
funds,
they
are
paid
directly
or
indirectly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
subsidy
to
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
a
general
distribution
of
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
it
ever
so
held
with
respect
to
a
general
distribution
--
an
unrestricted
distribution
of
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
string
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
connolly,
the
reference
to
west
point
raises
this
question
in
my
mind.
do
you
contend
that
these
institutions
are
so
secular
in
character
that
the
state
of
maryland
could
pay
100%
of
the
cost
of
running
institution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
care
to
show
how
large
the
total
budget
of
these
schools
is?
they
get
about
$100,000
a
year
from
maryland,
i
gather?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
is
there
any
danger
in
a
program
like
this
that
the
university
or
the
college
will
curtail
its
religious
activity
in
order
to
be
sure
it
is
eligible
for
the
state
donation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
cuts
the
other
way
in
answer
to
my
question.
if
they
are
avoiding
inculcating
religious
values
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
funds,
do
you
think
that
perhaps
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
run
the
schools
precisely
as
they
would
run
them
were
they
no
state
program?
