justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
when
they
taught
they
were
dressed
in
their
clerical
clothing
to
identify
their
full-time
occupation
association?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
could
not
teach
is
that
a
certain
theological
tenant
is
true
and
everything
else
s
false?
justice
potter
stewart
that
that
is
no
longer
the
academic
teaching
of
comparative
religion
nor
the
history
of
religion
nor
something
like
that,
but
it
is
theological
propaganda,
if
you
will,
to
use
that
word?
justice
potter
stewart
to
inculcate
specific
theological
tenants?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
private
colleges
and
universities
are
or
at
least
historically
were
church-related,
harvard,
yale,
princeton,
columbia,
woodenburg,
canyon?
justice
potter
stewart
there
may
be
exemptions,
i
think
i
know
one
in
indiana,
but
the
vast
majority
of
private
colleges
and
universities
are
church-related,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least
vestigially?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
a
matter
in
each
case
of
degree
rather
than
two
separate
categories
between
church-related
on
the
one
hand
and
sectarian?
it
is
how
much
church-related,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
you
had
a
biology
professor
at
harvard
who
chose
to
begin
his
biology
courses
each
session
with
prayer?
would
that
make
harvard
an
impermissible
recipient
of
a
governmental
aid?
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
was
that
if
there
are
prayers
in
a
classroom
at
harvard
that
that
is
a
touchstone,
that
is
a
litmus
paper
test
of
whether
or
not
something
is
impermissible
and
church-related?
justice
potter
stewart
it
can
provide
for
itself,
at
least
to
the
last
i
knew
it
did,
of
being
a
free
institution
and
if
a
particular
professor
decided
of
zoology
or
biology
that
he
wanted
to
open
his
class
with
a
prayer
and
any
students
who
wanted
to
join
in
could
join
in,
others
are
free
not
to
or
to
arrive
late.
would
that
in
and
off
itself
make
harvard
a
constitutionally
impermissible
recipient
of
government
aid?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
chemistry
class
in
harvard
the
professor,
a
very
able
chemist,
also
happens
to
be
a
very
strong
atheist
and
he
put
into
his
class
each
day
a
couple
of
minutes
is
used
propagandizing
atheism.
would
that
make
harvard
eligible
as
a
recipient
of
public
funds?
justice
potter
stewart
how
and
why
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
and
why
constitutionally
is
it
different?
justice
potter
stewart
by
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
is
equally
protected
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
tax
funds
could
be
used
to
support
a
center
of
atheistic
teaching
without
violating
the
establishment
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
stating
this
correctly
as
to
what
this
law
and
the
district
court
judgment
permits
and
authorizes?
let
us
assume
that
every
single
teacher
in
all
these
institutions
in
courses
in
theology
and
religion
is
in
fact
a
lay
person,
nonetheless,
the
law,
as
construed
by
the
district
court,
does
not
permit
a
public
subsidy
of
their
salaries,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
no
matter
if
they
are
all
lay
people
and
on
the
other
hand,
let
us
assume
that
all
of
the
faculty
in
all
of
the
other
areas
and
courses
of
these
institutions,
mathematics,
biology,
zoology,
astronomy,
home
economics,
foreign
languages,
english,
and
history
and
the
rest
of
it
are
all
clergymen
or
clergywomen,
this
law
and
the
course
decree
permit
public
taxpayer
subsidies
of
all
their
salaries,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
true,
as
the
chief
justiceâ€™s
question
has
suggested
it,
annapolis,
west
point,
and
the
air
force
academy
and
the
other
places?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
factually
true?
