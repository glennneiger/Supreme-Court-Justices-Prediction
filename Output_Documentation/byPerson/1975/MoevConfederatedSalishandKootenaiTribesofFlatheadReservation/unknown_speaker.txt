unknown
speaker
does
the
district
court
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
fee
for
the
registration
of
the
vehicle?
unknown
speaker
and
that
fee
is
not
an
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
what
is
an
issue
in
addition
to
the
cigarette
taxes,
simply
the
personal
property
tax
on
the
automobile,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
question
to
put
it,
it
does
remain
a
reservation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
haddon,
as
to
all
this,
there
is
not
any
dispute
as
there
i
think.
we
know
this
background,
i
am
anxious
for
you
to
get
to
the
issues.
unknown
speaker
who
drew
that
line
originally?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
a
new
line,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
according
to
your
arguments,
mr.
haddon,
i
take
it
that
at
least
part
of
your
argument
is
that
you
are
asserting
fourteenth
amendment
claims
are
you
or
fifth
amendment
claims,
equal
protection
claims
on
behalf
of
the
non-indian
citizens
of
montana?
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
you
need
basis
for
the
state
to
collect
the
tax
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
haddon,
let
me
interrupt
you
further.
does
an
indian
vendor
who
has
his
place
of
business
on
a
reservation
have
to
purchase
a
montana
license
to
sell
cigarettes?
unknown
speaker
is
this
separate
and
distinct
from
the
tax
on
the
cigarettes
themselves?
unknown
speaker
is
it
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
next,
is
there
any
montana
statute
that
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
for
anyone
to
use
a
cigarette
from
an
unstamped
package?
unknown
speaker
well
then
do
you
argue
that
the
state
of
montana
has
an
interest,
a
distinct
interest
in
preventing
anyone
from
violating
that
statute
namely
the
purchase
of
a
non-stamp
cigarette
package?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
did
not
get
that
argument
from
your
brief
focusing
on
that
state
interest
but
you
satisfied
me
now.
alright.
unknown
speaker
the
act
of
1877?
unknown
speaker
now
was
that
act
applicable
to
the
flathead
reservation
in
1877?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
any
significance
in
the
fact
that
did
not
become
applicable
until
when?
1904?
unknown
speaker
you
are
arguing
both
cigarettes
and
property?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
personal
property
tax
could
be
applied
to
any
personal
property
that
an
indian
owned
even
though
he
lived
on
the
reservation.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
only.
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
any
authority
to
that
effect
you
have
cited
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
you
were
permitted
to
have
the
indians
the
collect
the
sales
tax
on
sales
on
non-indians?
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
on
sales
to
indians.
unknown
speaker
and
you
could
not
make
them
get
a
license?
unknown
speaker
mr.
haddon,
do
you
think
the
court
rule
that
montana
not
only
could
not
put
the
personal
property
tax
on
an
automobile
but
could
not
put
it
on
the
automobile
even
though
it
was
used
of
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
court
has
already
decided
that
montana
may
not
say
to
the
indians
if
you
want
to
use
your
automobile
off
the
reservation
you
must
pay
that?
unknown
speaker
the
rule
being
what?
maybe
you
better
state
it
for
me.
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
the
case
i
should
be.
unknown
speaker
now
what
is
the
rule
of
the
case
in
which
you
rely?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
disposes
of
all
these
issues?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
an
issue
similar
to
that
in
the
tonasket
case
three
or
four
terms
ago
that
we
remanded
to
the
state
of
washington
court.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
the
law
of
washington
now
is
the
same
as
the
law
of
montana
now?
unknown
speaker
the
state
may
collect
from
indian
sellers
the
prepayment
of
taxes
on
cigarettes
sold
to
non-indian
buyers,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
done
in
of
state
of
washington
in
the
wake
of
the
tonasket
litigation?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
law
there.
unknown
speaker
it
is
before
then
you
leave
the
merits
to
move
on
to
my
brother
rehnquistâ€™s
interest
in
the
anti-injunction
act.
mcclanahan
and
no
other
case
in
this
court
so
far
as
i
know
and
you
tell
me
if
i
am
mistaken
i
may
well
be
considered
this
constitutional
argument,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
this
equal
protection
argument
is
what
i
am
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
we
had
the
case
last
term
i
cannot
think,
the
style
for
the
moment
or
even
the
precise
issue
in
which
justice
blackmun
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
involving
a
claim
that
a
preferential
hiring
policy
for
indians
on
reservations
violated
both
the
constitution
and
their
statute.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
case
we
have
just
been
discussing.
unknown
speaker
the
source
of
the
indian
immunity
is?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
you
decided
to
concede
whatever
authority
the
united
states
had
with
respect
to
indians
whether
it
is
rests
on
the
constitution
or
in
the
statute
ought
to
be
exercised
consistent
with
the
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
one
question
mr.
baenen.
i
will
cooperate
in
every
way
with
the
seemingly
consensual
desire
of
everybody
to
get
you
back
to
montana.
unknown
speaker
oh!
that
is
good
that
you
live
here.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
doubt
that
united
states
could
have
brought
an
action
on
behalf
of
the
indian
tribes
seeking
this
same
sort
of
relief
in
its
own
courts?
unknown
speaker
but
that
cuts
both
ways
i
suppose,
because
clearly
the
indian
rights
could
have
been
vindicated
by
the
united
states
and
then
there
will
be
no
question
of
the
applicability
of
anti-injunction
act.
when
the
tribe
itself
sues,
it
may
not
be
suing
with
all
the
matter
that
is
brought
at
least
with
respect
to
the
anti-injunction
act
when
the
suit
is
brought
by
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
in
1362
also?
unknown
speaker
this
is
providing
a
specific
statutory
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act?
unknown
speaker
1962
was
enacted
when?
in
1966,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
long
after
the
anti-injunction
act
was
on
the
books.
