mr.
haddon,
if
your
argument
is
valid
about
the
discrimination
aspects,
i
take
it
the
same
argument
would
apply
to
a
reservation
which
had
100%
indian
population
and
also
full-bloodied
indians?
i
am
just
wondering
if
there
is
really
anything.
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
relevance
of
your
initial
description
of
the
unique
character
of
this
reservation.
how
does
that
relate
to
the
argument
you
are
making?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
the
position
to
which
you
are
falling
back
that
is
what
i
like
to
know?
