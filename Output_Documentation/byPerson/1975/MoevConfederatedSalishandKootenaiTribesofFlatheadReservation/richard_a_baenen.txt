mr.
richard
a.
baenen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
perhaps
we
can
approach
this
argument
by
noting
one
or
two
matters
at
the
outset.
the
1970
census
prepared
by
the
department
of
congress
shows
that
there
are
115
reservations
in
the
united
states
which
are
recognized
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
pursuant
to
the
congressional
authority
contained
in
the
indian
re-organization
or
wheeler-howard
act
as
it
is
properly
known.
in
addition,
that
in
fiscal
1975,
the
united
states
spent
through
federal
appropriations
$766
million
in
pursuant
to
its
federal
policy
on
indians
and
indian
affair.
in
1790,
the
united
states
enacted
its
first
statute
with
18
indians,
the
indian
non-intercourse
act.
the
united
states
has
been
imminently
involved
in
indian
affairs
from
then
down
to
this
date.
we
have
under
flathead
reservation
a
situation
whereby
virtue
of
the
historical
development
and
certain
congressional
activities
an
integrated
reservation.
we
do
not
have
and
the
counsel
for
the
state
has
been
unable
to
point
to
a
single
case
or
a
single
legal
ruling
or
a
single
federal
statute
which
would
say
the
flathead
reservation
and
the
question
of
state
jurisdiction
as
it
applies
to
indians
on
that
reservation
is
any
different
than
in
the
cases
involving
the
navajo
reservation
such
as
mcclanahan,
the
navajo
reservation
such
as
williams
v.
lee,
the
flathead
reservation
or
excuse
me,
the
blackfoot
reservation
such
a
find
in
kennerly.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
in
our
view,
the
mcclanahan
case
and
the
cases
that
preceded
it
williams
v.
lee,
warren
trading
post,
kennerly,
mescalero
apache
disposed
off
this
issue
with
the
exception
for
the
one
decision
by
the
court
below
holding
that
the
state
of
montana
could
force
tribal
members
residing
on
the
reservation
to
pre-collect
the
personal
property
tax
that
is
owed
by
the
non-indian
purchaser
when
he
purchases
from
a
tribal
smoke
shop
as
they
are
called.
we
do
not
believe
and
we
believe
that
mcclanahan
v.
arizona
settled
that
question
that
the
state
cannot
force
a
tribal
member
to
collect
a
cigarette
tax
owed
by
a
non-member
and
for
which
a
non-member
is
guilty
of
a
state
violation
should
he
purchase
and
have
in
his
property
or
in
his
possession
such
a
cigarette
tax
and
the
state
of
montana
has
criminal
jurisdiction
over
that
non-indian
should
he
violate
the
state
law.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
you
did
your
honor.
in
the
tonasket
case,
the
issue
relate
to
the
question
of
pre-collection
from
non-indians.
you
remanded
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
for
reconsideration
of
its
decision
which
held
that
the
state
could
force
the
indian
salesman
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
non-indian
purchaser
in
light
of
a
washington
enactment
which
was
passed
by
the
washington
and
legislature
after
the
state
or
supreme
court
decision
which
held
that
non-indians
could
possess
two
cartons
at
any
one
time
of
unstamped
cigarettes
and
there
would
not
be
violation
of
the
washington
law.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
upon
remand
from
this
court
determined
that
the
pre-collection
requirement
did
not
violate
the
constitutional
statutory
rights
of
the
indians
on
the
call
of
reservation.
this
court
did
not
review
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
five
months
later
the
state
of
washington
revoked
the
law
by
which
non-indians
could
possess
two
cartons
of
unstamped
cigarettes.
that
is
a
present
status
as
it
relates
to
washington.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
the
law
of
washington
is
the
same
as
the
three-judge
court
below.
that
is
correct.
the
law
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
well
we
get
into
a
very
difficult
and
sticky
wicket
here.
the
three-judge
court
below
said
that
the
state
may
force
that
the
indian
must
collect
the
cigarette
tax,
the
sales
tax
and
admitted
however
that
how
this
would
be
implemented,
how
it
would
be
carried
out
since
the
state
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
tribal
members
who
are
effectuating
the
sale.
they
recognize
that
this
will
be
an
extremely
difficult
problem.
they
suggested
in
their
order
that
they
assumed
this
court
would
perhaps
review
its
decision
and
that
based
upon
whatever
guidance
it
might
receive
from
this
court
assuming
that
it
was
not
reversed,
that
we
would
try
to
work
out
some
type
of
a
procedure.
we
submit
that
the
question
was
raised
in
mcclanahan
and
the
state
had
no
answer
when
the
question
was
asked
as
to
how
the
state
could
allege
and
assert
that
its
income
taxes
are
enforceable
against
mrs.
mcclanahan
for
income
earned
while
residing
on
the
reservation
when
the
state
conceded
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
her
to
compel
the
collection
of
that
tax.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
i
have
no
knowledge
your
honor;
i
cannot
answer
your
question.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
that
is
the
law,
i
understand
however
that
there
is
a
case
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
involves
that
issue
and
i
understand
further
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
stayed
consideration
of
the
particular
issue
until
upon
granting
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit
state
and
the
determination
until
this
court
should
speak
in
this
case.
that
is
the
preset
status.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
need
go
beyond
mcclanahan
and
the
cases
cited
as
supported
of
it
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
below
as
it
relates
to
the
inapplicability
of
the
cigarette
licensing
and
the
cigarette
sales
tax
on
indians
as
far
as
transactions
are
concerned
under
the
reservation
nor
the
reverse
the
court
below
on
the
requirement
that
an
indian
telling
the
non-indians
on
that
reservation
must
pre-collect
in
turnover
of
the
tax
to
the
state.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
most
certainly,
if
the
court
would
please.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
fine.
your
honor,
i
am
happy
to
entertain
a
question
because
we
believe
that
mcclanahan
supports
our
position
down
the
line
and
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
is
gained
by
me
reasserting
that
so
if
you
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
was
not
trying
to
answer
your
question
on
the
anti-injunction
act
by
citing
mcclanahan.
i
meant
on
the
merits.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
to
my
knowledge
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
not
addressed
as
an
argument
as
certainly
a
number
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
which
treaty
rights
have
been
vindicated
by
indians
by
implication
carry
with
it
the
fact
that
they
will
be
treated
in
a
way
different
from
the
way
that
non-indians
are
treated.
i
think
for
example,
and
what
we
call
puyallup
2,
the
second
fishing
case
where
in
a
concurring
opinions
it
was
pointed
out
that
state
money
derived
from
the
sale
of
fishing
licenses
was
used
in
part
to
replenish
the
stock
that
was
involved
in
the
fishing
case.
there
is
implicit
recognition
there.
we
have,
for
example
in
the
mazurie
case
where
the
state
is
precluded
and
a
non-indian
on
free
land
is
precluded
from
having
a
business
under
state
law
relation
to
the
dispensation
of
liquor
within
an
indian
reservation.
he
is
treated
differently
than
somebody
outside
the
reservation.
there
are,
in
almost
every
case
i
believe
these
implications
to
be
found
but
you
are
correct.
it
has
not
been
raised
and
addressed
as
such
which
explains
of
course
the
paucity
of
citations
by
the
state
parties.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
right,
your
honor
that
was
morton
v.
mancari.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
correct
and
also
cited
on
his
brief.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
your
honor
we
debated
within
our
own
offices
to
whether
or
not
we
should
raised
that
as
an
issue
before
the
court.
we
concluded
that
the
state
as
the
tax
gathering
body
perhaps
could
stand
in
the
position
of
tax
payers
to
raise
it.
we
do
believe
that
it
is
an
open
question
but
we
did
not
challenge
it.
i
assume
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
it
is
a
jurisdictional
source
your
honor
based
upon
the
fact
that
congress
historically
has
exercised
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
its
authority
granted
by
article
2
clause
8
section
3
of
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
certainly
any
authority
that
the
united
states
has
in
terms
of
indian
affairs
has
to
be
exercised
consistently
with
other
constitutional
provisions
just
as
the
authority
has
to
raise
and
maintain
armies
must
be
exercised
consistently
with
other
statutory
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
we
did
not
raise
it
your
honor.
the
court
below
raised
it
sue
sponte
by
judge
smith
writing
for
a
dissent.
we
believe
frankly
that
state
parties
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
it.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
your
honor,
i
can
easily
finish
in
five
minutes.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
if
permitted.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
that
is
alright
your
honor,
i
live
here.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
it
is
my
brethren
that
i
worry
about.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind.
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
united
states
not
only
could
have
brought
the
lawsuit
but
that
if
the
court
should
determine
that
section
1341
was
at
bar
to
the
court
hearing
the
cases
down
below.
in
light
of
what
has
transpired
we
believe
the
united
states
in
fulfilling
its
trust
obligation
to
these
indians
will
have
to
turn
around
and
file
the
identical
lawsuit.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
that
is
a
distinct
possibility.
certainly,
if
we
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
the
cases
that
have
interpreted
the
anti-injunction
act
which
have
canvassed
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
same
and
pay
particular
attention
to
say
the
livingston)
case
where
the
united
states
was
joined
in
a
lawsuit
in
which
the
dupont
demours
company
was
involved.
the
lower
court
had
no
problem
in
entertaining
the
suit
with
both
parties
made
no
effort
to
say
that
the
dupont
demours
could
not
be
present
and
this
court
affirmed
albeit
not
with
opinion.
however,
that
case,
i
think
stands
for
strong
precedent
that
the
tribes
particularly
operating
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
section
1362
of
the
legislative
history
of
which
shows
congress
was
very
intent
because
it
recognizes
the
united
states
as
trustee
has
insufficient
resources
in
terms
of
personnel
and
finances
to
bring
all
of
the
lawsuit
it
ought
to
bring
to
vindicate
indian
tribal
rights
allowed
indian
tribes
if
recognized
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
file
a
lawsuit
that
the
united
states
could
have
filed.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
yes,
1362
was
a
very
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
no
sir,
i
believe
that
you
have
to
read
section
1362
in
context
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
oneida
dealing
with
the
scope
and
thrust
of
the
jurisdiction
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
indian
tribe.
we
have
--
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
66
or
68.
mr.
richard
a.
baenen
correct.
i
believe
it
has
to
be
construed.
i
believe
it
is
an
imperative
construction
of
several
statutes
and
we
have
to
take
into
new
account
some
of
the
judicial
decisions
that
were
on
the
books
at
that
time
this
court
has
dealt
in
the
case
of
case,
the
first
name
of
which
i
can
never
pronounce,
quaffabidity
(ph)
holding
that
an
individual
indian
can
bring
a
suit
because
very
often,
the
united
states
does
not
want
to
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest
or
does
not
have
time.
and
we
think
that
the
1968
jurisdictional
grant
under
1362
should
be
construed
as
fitting
in
to
the
exceptions
that
we
find
affirmed
by
lower
courts
and
this
court
in
livingston
as
it
relates
to
the
anti-injunction
act.
thank
you.
