justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
haddon,
let
me
ask
you
something
about
the
montana
personal
property
tax
for
licensing
vehicles
and
perhaps
i
can
best
put
the
question
by
telling
you
what
i
understand
to
be
the
virginia
law
which
is
the
jurisdiction.
i
happen
to
live.
in
virginia,
we
pay
a
personal
property
tax
on
personal
property
including
automobiles
and
then
you
pay
an
additional
fee
to
license
the
vehicle
to
travel
on
the
roads.
is
that
the
law
in
montana
or
the
two
combined
under
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baenen,
are
you
going
to
devote
some
part
of
your
oral
argument
to
the
anti-injunction
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
such
time
as
you
get
to
it.
your
opposing
counsel
did
not
devote
any
of
his
oral
argument
and
you
are
certainly
not
obligated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mcclanahan
came
up
on
the
supreme
court
of
arizona.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
do
not
have
any
problem
with
the
anti-injunction
act
in
mcclanahan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
how
does
mcclanahan
bear
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
anti-injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
did
not
raise
the
issue,
about
whether
the
state
could
raise
this
question
of
equal
protection?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
first
of
these
cases
moe
salish
and
the
consolidated
kootenai
tribes,
actions
were
brought
principally
against
the
state
of
montana's
department
of
revenue
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
montana,
and
the
tribe
attacked
a
variety
of
state
taxes
sought
to
be
collected
by
the
states
from
indians
residing
on
the
flathead
reservation,
on
a
ground
that
neither
the
constitution
nor
any
act
of
congress
authorize
such
taxation.
the
district
court
found
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe's
claim
despite
the
apparent
barrier
that
congress
had
established
by
the
anti-injunction
act
and
on
the
merits
it
agreed
with
the
tribe
that
with
one
exception
the
state
taxes
were
invalid.
the
state
officials
have
appealed
and
the
tribe
has
appealed
as
to
the
exception
found
by
the
district
court.
we
hold
first
that
the
district
court
properly
entertained
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe's
attack
on
the
taxes
involved
not
withstanding
the
anti-injunction
act.
we
hold
second
that
the
imposition
of
a
personal
property
tax
on
property
such
as
automobiles
owned
by
indians
residing
on
the
reservation
has
not
been
authorized
by
congress.
whether
or
not
the
payment
of
such
attacks
is
a
precondition
of
the
indians
registration
of
his
automobile.
although
we
know
it
parenthetically
that
regulated
both
parties
have
conceded
and
we
agree
that
the
state
may
require
reservation
indians
to
pay
a
fee
to
actually
license
a
motor
vehicle
which
is
driven
on
the
public
highways.
and
thirdly
the
imposition
of
a
state
sales
tax
and
a
vendor's
license
fee
on
the
retail
sales
of
cigarettes
by
reservation
indians
who
operate
so
called
smoke
shops,
on
tribal
trust
land
is
invalid
to
the
extent
that
these
sales
are
made
two
indians
who
live
on
the
reservation.
but
such
cigarette
sales
taxes
are
valid
with
respect
to
sales
by
indian
vendors
to
non-indians.
the
sales
tax
in
this
latter
situation
impacts
solely
on
the
non
indian
purchaser
and
we
hold
that
the
state
may
require
the
indian
vendor
to
pre-collect
it.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
therefore
is
affirmed
both
on
the
appeal
of
the
state
officials
and
on
the
appeal
of
the
tribe.
