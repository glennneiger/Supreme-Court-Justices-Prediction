justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
challenging
something
about
the
first
circuit's
holding
in
that
respect,
are
you
not
on
this
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
i
understand
your
reasoning
behind
that,
you
are
saying
that
the
reason
it
is
not
an
attack
on
the
morris
rule
is
that
out
of
force
of
compulsion
you
have
complied
with
the
first
circuit's
judgment
and
that
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
satisfactory
reason.
there
maybe
other
good
reasons
why
a
three-judge
district
court
was
not
required,
but
to
say
that
rhode
island
is
now
doing
something
that
the
first
circuit
told
it
that
it
had
to
do
that
it
would
not
other
wise
do,
i
do
not
know
that
is
an
entirely
adequate
answer
of
the
government’s
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
the
action
in
the
district
court
was
a
challenge
to
a
regulation
of
state
wide
applicability,
was
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
the
consent
decree
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
disciplinary
proceeding,
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
sixth
amendment,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
they
are
not
compelled
to
be
there
at
all,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
board
is
permitted
to
consider
the
inmates’
silence
as
a
failure
to
refuse,
to
refute
or
explain
matters
within
in
his
knowledge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
see
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
this
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
this
court
has
never
held
that
in
a
civil
proceeding
a
state
is
required
to
draw
no
inference,
whatever
from
a
persons’
claim
of
self-incrimination,
has
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
--
you
contend
that
is
not
required
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
his
problem
is
just
of
having
to
testify
in
order
to
explain
at
disciplinary
is
just
one
of
the
numerous
problems
that
confronts
any
criminal
defendant
as
witness
magna
carta.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
present
during
the
interrogation,
you
mean
just
during
the
interrogation
of
the
inmate
or
during
the
interrogation
of
any
of
the
other
witness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
got
a
little
bit
of
a
problem
and
it
is
the
morris
rules
may
not
be
applicable
anywhere
else
and
by
virtue
of
the
state
stipulation
grabs
something
that
the
morris
rules
provide
may
not
be
required
by
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
can
concomitantly
the
morris
rule,
it
is
not
just
the
question
whether
the
morris
rules
go
far
enough
to
satisfy
the
constitution
as
you
intimate
the
first
circuit
said,
but
it
is
quite
possible
since
the
state
stipulated
that
the
morris
rules
may
in
some
instances
go
further
than
the
constitution
requires?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
seems
to
be
it
is
not
always
a
wise
predicate
to
argue
from
something
that
is
in
the
morris
rules
as
if
that
were
a
constitutional
given?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
wolff
certainly
did
not
qualify
the
language
at
all,
it
says
no
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
matter
with
that
in
the
civil
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
the
plaintiff’s
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
when
he
is
asked
a
question
by
defense
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
have
a
civil
proceeding
here.
would
not
the
role
of
the
inmate
be
analogous
to
that
of
a
civil
defendant,
that
is
he
ought
to
be
summonable
to
the
stand
by
whoever
is
presiding
over
the
hearing
and
claim
his
privilege
question
by
question
rather
than
simply
be
able
to
invoke
a
general
fifth
amendment
privilege,
not
even
to
be
called
the
way
a
criminal
defendant
can?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
i
am
asking
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
is
there
any
requirement
as
the
rhode
island
disciplinary
board
not
at
least
call
the
inmate
even
against
his
will
to
the
chair
or
the
stand
whatever
they
have
in
the
room
and
make
him
claim
his
privilege
question
by
question,
rather
than
simply
assert
a
blanket
privilege?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
you
thought
the
hearing
was
on
an
preliminary
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
would
go
to
the
breadth
of
the
injunction
and
not
to
whether
it
should
have
been
a
preliminary
as
opposed
to
a
permanent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
voluntarily
mr.
stein,
you
mean
not
under
the
compulsion
of
the
districts
court's
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
are
you
in
a
position
to
complain
about
anything
that
is
included
in
your
voluntary
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
maintain
that
position,
you
would
have
to
say
that
because
the
plan
was
originally
directed
to
be
submitted
by
the
district
court,
it
is
under
the
force
of
the
court's
order.
otherwise
if
you
are
here
doing
some
voluntarily
that
is
beyond
the
constitution,
i
do
not
think
you
have
any
claim
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
you
are
not
challenging
anything
that
is
included
in
your
plan,
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
at
california,
we
are
doing
it
voluntarily.
it
would
not
have
the
standing
to
raise
the
claims
of
oregon
and
washington
just
because
the
ninth
circuit
(inaudible)
territory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
actually
if
that
is
right
that
this
issue
really
should
never
come
up
until
a
subsequent
criminal
trial,
we
are
just
going
to
decide
cases
that
are
before
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
there
is
no
occasion
for
any
court
to
pass
on
that
question
until
it
is
confronted
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
turner,
if
these
conditions
can
prolong
the
man's
confinement
as
you
say,
why
is
it
maintainable
at
all
in
1983
under
preiser?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
were
dysfunction
of
convict
--
of
some
judgment,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
it
not
lead
to
at
least
earlier
release?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
possibly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
why
is
it
that
barred
under
preiser?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
rely
on
that
language
not
graven
in
stone
for
a
case
remanded
to
a
court
of
appeals
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
wolff?
you
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
free
to
take
some
tact
that
is
in
anyway
inconsistent
with
wolff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
would
be
regardless
of
whether
there
were
language
about
being
graven
in
stone?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
forfeiture
under
your
language,
is
it
not
mcnaughton
pretty
much
against
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
still
had
to
decide
whether
they
take
the
stand
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
he
just
wants
to
say,
i
just
want
to
point
out
here
some
of
the
short
comings
in
the
testimonies
of
other
witnesses.
is
he
prevented
from
doing
that?
does
he
then
open
himself
up
for
a
complete
interrogation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
your
answer
to
that
is
no,
i
would
think
there
is
not
much
to
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
there
was
no
possibility
of
future
prosecution
in
the
wolff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
the
constitutional
violation
in
a
typical
miranda
interrogation
followed
by
a
criminal
trial
occurs
that
the
time
of
the
interrogation
or
only
if
the
court
fails
to
exclude
the
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words
the
defendant
could
not
get
an
injunction
out
of
perhaps
judge
zerppley
to
say
that
you
may
not
interrogate
this
man
without
giving
him
miranda
warning.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really
stands
wolff
of
its
head
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
and
that
we
said
that
the
general
presumptions
against
cross
examination
in
wolff
and
the
ninth
circuit
comes
along
down
and
says
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
cross
examination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
that
was
not
my
question
to
you
because
i
said
i
would
read
wolff
as
saying
there
is
a
presumption
against
cross
examination
and
now
along
comes
the
ninth
circuit
and
says
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
it.
now,
do
not
you
think
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
wolff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
what
business
does
the
ninth
circuit
have
doing
that
on
a
remand
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
wolff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
business
do
any
of
them
had,
then
if
you
say
it
is
inconsistent
with
spirit
if
wolff?mr.
william
bennett
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
mean
what
the
court
said
in
wolff
was
not
necessary
to
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
are
then
free
to
say
there
is
a
right
of
cross
examination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
should
be
permissible
only
if
wolff
left
it
over?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
really
care
when
you
say
it
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
wolff
i
gathered,
you
said
at
least
you
thought
you
did
not
think
it
left
it
over?
