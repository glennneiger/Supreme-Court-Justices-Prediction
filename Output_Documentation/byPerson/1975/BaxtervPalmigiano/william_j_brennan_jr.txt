(voice

you
said
at
a
future
time.
justice
jr.
(voice

only
if
he
were
prosecuted
--
justice
jr.
--
criminally
for
the
conduct
which
lead
to
the
disciplinary
proceedings,
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
but
only
there
(inaudible).
justice
jr.
where
the
acts
(inaudible),
the
infraction
charge
may
also
be
a
criminal
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
is
not
there
a
difference
between
using
his
silence,
the
disciplinary
board
using
his
silence
as
an
inference
that
the
alleged
infraction
was
in
fact
committed
by
him
and
if
he
is
been
prosecuted
using
his
silence
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
is
not
there
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
is
a
difference,
is
not
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
would
say
they
cannot
use
his
silence
either
as
bearing
on
whether
he
did
it
--
on
whether
he
committed
the
infraction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
use
the
silence
if
later
he
is
prosecuted
for
the
very
same
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
there
is
a
difference
between
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
far
as
--
of
course
our
cases
have
said
that
neither
judge
nor
prosecutor
at
a
criminal
trial
can
comment
on
the
fact
that
one
has
not
taken
the
stand,
but
what
is
the
fact
of
life
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concern?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
the
human
beings
in
compose
of
the
disciplinary
to
be
the
only
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
even
if
i
say
to
them,
look
we
will
not
use
your
silence
against
you?
justice
jr.
formally
certified?
justice
jr.
significant
whether
it
is
treated
as
a
class
action?
justice
jr.
the
named
plaintiff
is
still
here,
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
we
have
the
distinction
before
us.
you
have
suggested
that
prisoner
may
always
communicate
with
an
attorney,
but
during
the
course
of
one
of
these
proceedings,
disciplinary
proceedings,
the
attorney
may
not
be
near
by
for
him
to
communicate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
is
it
that
he
is
permitted
to
communicate,
that
is
what
i
do
not
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
he
will
have
the
opportunity
to
somehow
to
communicate
with
the
attorney
in
advance
of
the
actual
disciplinary
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
may
the
attorney
come
to
the
institution
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
one
as
clutchette?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
not
class
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
has
been
no
certification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
certification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
new
plaintiff,
this
intervenor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
i
mean,
whether
or
not
it
is
class
action,
it
is
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
in
jacobs
last
year,
we
held
that
where
a
district
court
had
made
exactly
the
same
observation
as
you
suggest
judge
zappley
(ph)
made
here
that,
that
was
not
a
sufficient
certification,
but
i
take
it,
it
does
not
make
any
difference?
justice
jr.
some
kind
of
meaning
what?
