mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
providence
plantations
in
the
case
of
baxter
v.
palmigiano.
this
case
centers
on
two
issues,
whether
counsels
are
required
to
be
present
at
in
prison
disciplinary
hearings
where
the
infraction
complained
off
may
also
be
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecution.
and
second,
whether
use
immunity
must
be
granted
for
any
statements
made
at
the
hearing
where
the
silence
of
the
inmate
is
considered
as
a
factor
by
the
disciplinary
board.
before
i
address
of
those
two
issues,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
make
mention
of
a
footnote
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
questioning
whether
a
three-judge
court
should
have
been
convened
in
this
case
and
i
must
state
that
the
solicitor
general
was
in
error
when
he
says
that,
this
case
is
an
attack
on
the
morris
rules
because
there
is
nothing
any
rule
or
statute
or
regulation
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
which
prevents
counsels
from
being
present
at
these
disciplinary
hearings.
the
rules
are
clear
that
an
inmate
has
a
right
to
assistance
by
a
classification
officer
or
any
other
individual
authorized
by
the
warden
and
since
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit,
attorneys
have
been
authorized
by
the
warden
to
be
present
in
these
cases.
so
therefore,
no
holding
in
this
case
withhold
the
statute
of
rhode
island
or
regulation
to
be
invalid.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
we
are,
your
honor,
but
i
felt
since
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
had
been
raised
that
it
was
my
obligation
to
bring
this
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
it
can,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
right.
what
am
i
trying
to
understand
your
honor
especially
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
under
the
compulsion
of
the
first
circuit's
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
yes,
your
honor.
we
advised
the
warden
that
there
was
at
the
present
time
prior
to
the
first
circuit's
decision
no
requirement
that
counsel
be
present
at
these
hearings.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
that
is
exactly
correct
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
your
honor
we
are
just
--
we
made
a
legal
determination
before
the
first
circuit's
decision
that
legal
counsel
were
not
required,
but
in
no
way
has
there
been
any
change
in
any
statute
or
regulation
of
the
state
of
rhode
island,
that
is
my
point.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
it
was
not
a
regulation,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
my
point
is
that
the
morris
rules
do
not
forbid
counsel
at
disciplinary
hearings.
they
state
that
it
is
any
person
authorized
by
the
warden
or
the
department
of
corrections
and
actually
when
the
morris
rules
were
drafted,
i
have
been
told
that
this
specific
point
was
not
covered
because
of
the
doubt
on
it,
and
therefore,
they
decided
to
leave
it
blank.
and
to,
i
will
put
this
language
and
it
will
authorize
either
lawyers
and
non-lawyers
depending
on
what
the
law
determined
to
be.
to
go
on
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
inmate
palmigiano
who
was
incarcerated
in
the
rhode
island
adult
correction
institution
for
murder.
on
november
11th
1972,
decided
that
another
inmate
needed
medical
attention
and
because
it
was
not
being
granted
quickly
enough,
he
went
around
advising
the
other
inmates
not
to
return
to
their
cells
at
the
time
of
the
9
p.m.
lock
up.
he
was
subsequently
charged
within
correction's
office
with
inciting
a
riot
and
a
disruption
and
he
was
told
that
evening
that
he
might
be
prosecuted
for
state
crime.
two
days
later,
a
disciplinary
hearing
was
held
pursuant
to
the
morris
rules
and
at
that
time
after
consulting
with
his
attorney
prior
to
the
hearing,
he
asked
that
he
be
admitted
to
the
hearing
of
the
captain
baxter
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
disciplinary
board,
stated
that
disciplinary
boards,
our
disciplinary
boards,
they
are
not
courts
of
law,
it
will
be
treated
as
a
disciplinary
case.
you
have
been
offered
to
postpone
it,
you
refused
it.
we
do
not
have
as
an
institutional
policy
attorney
sitting
in
on
disciplinary
hearings.
your
request
is
denied.
a
case
was
brought
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
of
rhode
island
concluded
that
procedural
due
process
had
been
awarded
to
the
inmate,
mr.
palmigiano
appealed
to
the
first
circuit
where
the
first
circuit
held
in
baxter
one
that
he
was
committed
to
have
a
retained
counsel,
but
not
appointed
counsel
and
that
use
immunity
should
be
granted
for
any
statements
that
he
made.
the
state
of
rhode
island
petitioned
for
its
certiorari
which
is
granted.
the
case
was
vacated
and
remanded
in
light
of
this
court‘s
opinion
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell.
the
first
circuit
handed
down
a
second
opinion
in
which
they
stated
that
no
counsel
was
required
except
in
those
cases
where
an
infraction
might
be
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecution
and
in
that
instance
they
said
that
miranda
perhaps
required
the
counsel
be
present.
and
then
they
also
stated
the
use
immunity
would
be
required
where
the
silence
of
the
inmate
at
the
hearing
was
considered
as
a
factor
against
him.
it
is
states
position
here
that
this
court's
opinion
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
has
already
covered
the
situation.
if
underlying
facts
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
include
inmates
who
had
committed
infractions
are
also
possible
subject
of
criminal
prosecution.
the
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
case
was
a
class
action
unlike
this
case
and
there
were
inmates
in
that
case
who
had
--
where
they
committed
infractions
for
insurrection,
threatening
to
kill
an
officer,
assault
and
drunkenness.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
because
of
these
underlying
facts,
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
covers
the
situations
of
disciplinary
hearings
where
infractions
may
also
be
a
subject
of
possible
future
criminal
prosecution.
more
specifically,
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
court's
opinion
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
which
specifically
cites
baxter
one.
and
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
the
court
said
that
it
is
our
view,
however,
that
the
procedures
we
have
now
required
in
prison
disciplinary
proceedings
represent
a
reasonable
accommodation
between
the
interest
of
the
inmates
and
the
need
of
institution,
footnote
20.
and
that
footnote
reads
that
the
court
of
appeals
which
have
ruled
on
procedures
required
in
prisonary-disciplinary
proceedings
have
been
split.
as
to
counsels,
two
circuits
have
held
there
is
no
right
and
then
several
cases
are
cited
and
then
it
states
the
first
circuit,
baxter
v.
palmigiano,
holds
there
is
a
right
to
retain
counsel
even
where
a
staff
assistant
is
available.
well,
the
ninth
circuit,
clutchette
v.
procunier
envisions
some
sanctions
in
disciplinary
proceedings
calling
for
provision
of
counsel
and
has
determined
that
counsel
must
be
provided
where
a
prison
rule
violation
maybe
punishable
by
a
state
law.
it
is
our
position
that
this
footnote
clearly
indicates
that
this
court
did
not
agree
with
that
conclusion
and
that
it
is
determination
in
wolff
was
supposed
to
be
a
reason
more
accommodation
of
this
type
of
case
as
well
as
the
case
where
the
infractions
is
not
the
subject
to
future
criminal
prosecution.
if
one
looks
at
miranda,
which
is
really
the
issue
here,
how
far
does
miranda
apply,
once
these
that
the
underlined
situation
there
that
cause
the
court
to
issue
its
opinion
was
the
incommunicado
interrogation
of
possible
suspects.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
not
at
all
your
honor.
we
pointed
that
out
and
i
think
that
the
court
stated
many
times
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
that
disciplinary
hearings
are
not
criminal
trials.
but
our
point
is
at
the
sixth
amendment
is
not
applied
here
at
all
and
there
is
any
requirement
of
counsel,
it
is
because
the
fifth
amendment
does
apply
certainly
and
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
may
require
counsel
if
the
court
should
determine
that
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
rights
of
the
inmates.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
that
is
right
your
honor,
and
they
pointed
to
mathis
as
stating
that
miranda
applies
to
an
in
prison
setting,
but
it
is
our
point
of
view
your
honor
that
miranda
applies
to
incommunicado
interrogations.
here
the
disciplinary
hearing
is
held
under
of
the
auspicious
of
the
morris
rules
which
is
far
different
from
the
type
of
abuse
that
was
a
subject
in
miranda.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
your
honor,
the
inmate
is
entitled
to
a
counsel
substitute
with
a
classification
officer
at
the
prison.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
employed
by
the
state
of
rhode
island.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
on
the
inmate
your
honor
would
be
the
(inaudible)
and
even
the
inmate
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
your
honor,
there
are
other
safeguards.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
there
is
no
one
else
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
it
is
not
your
honor
because
first
of
all
the
inmate
has
oral
and
written
notice
in
advanced,
so
he
is
not
surprised.
he
has
timely
notice
about
the
right
to
remain
silent.
he
appears
at
the
disciplinary
board
with
the
right
to
assistance
of
an
authorized
counsel
substitute.
and
in
partial
tribunal,
none
of
whom
reported
upon,
witness
are
investigative
the
alleged
infraction,
sit
on
the
board.
he
has
the
right
to
call
witnesses
and
to
cross
examine
them
further
dispelling
any
atmosphere
of
incommunicado
interrogation.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
or
guards
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
and
also
i
think
this
is
a
significant,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
your
honor,
the
entire
proceeding
is
taped.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
no
your
honor.
i
have
stated
that
there
is
not
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
your
honor,
there
is
also
another
safeguard.
the
entire
disciplinary
hearing
taped
and
if
the
inmate
should
have
some
objection
to
the
hearing
then
the
tape
recordings
there
and
in
fact
that
the
record
in
this
case
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
it
could
be
used
to
show,
your
honor,
that
there
was
something
happened
in
the
hearing
where
he
was
not
granted
the
rights
of
the
morris
rules.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
intend
to
address
that
question
your
honor
and
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
shall.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
yes
your
honor.
sometimes
the
inmates
walk
out
and
refuse
to
take
part
in
anyway
of
the
board
goes
on
to
hear
the
evidence
that
is
presented
and
then
they
make
their
decision
known
to
the
inmate.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
they
are
not
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
attended
a
hearing
where
an
inmate
left
and
then
the
case
was
dismissed
because
of
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
no
your
honor,
their
advice
is
that
they
may
remain
silent.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
was
not
at
this
hearing
your
honor,
but
i
did
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
at
the
present
time
your
honor
under
in
to
the
first
circuit
opinion
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
no,
lawyers
were
not
permitted.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
just
attended
one
recently
your
honor,
in
order
to
have
a
real
life
experience
in
having
attended
a
hearing.
in
case
you
honors
wanted
to
ask
any
questions
in
how
they
are
conducted.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
your
honor
at
the
time
this
case
was
heard,
mr.
palmigiano
was
advised,
you
may
advise
your
client
to
remain
mute,
but
it
would
be
detrimental
to
his
defense
and
the
first
circuit
concluded
that
this
was
a
silence
being
held
against
the
inmate.
at
the
present
time,
the
inmates
are
advised
that
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent,
and
your
silence
will
not
be
a
determinative
factor
in
the
decision
of
the
disciplinary
board.
that
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
it
was
your
honor.
but
it
is
my
position
your
honor
that
even
in
this
case
that
the
inmate
silence
was
not
really
held
against
him.
it
is
a
factor
and
i
feel
it
is
a
factor
that
the
disciplinary
board
should
and
in
realistically
will
consider.
but
the
morris
rules
require
that
the
determination
of
the
disciplinary
board
should
be
based
on
substantial
evidence
and
the
state
concedes
that
the
silence
of
the
inmate
alone
is
not
substantial
evidence
and
unless
there
is
other
independent
substantial
evidence
that
the
inmate
should
not
be
found
guilty
of
the
infraction.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
at
the
time
of
palmigiano’s
hearing
your
honor
that
was
true.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
your
honor,
there
are
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
refuse
to
allow
prosecutors
to
comment
on
an
inmate's
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
right,
but
and
none
of
those
cases
has
it
actually
been
held
that
in
the
states
that
a
jury
in
a
criminal
proceeding
cannot
consider
silence.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
no,
your
honor.
and
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondent
here
concerning
criminal
trials
and
it
is
in
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
criminal
trial.
these
people
have
been
constitutionally
convicted
and
afforded
all
the
rights
of
a
free
man
before
they
enter
prison.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
do
not
know
your
honor,
that
i
would
not
do
it
without
researching
it.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
know
if
no
impediment,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
i
know
in
a
criminal
prosecution
that
would
be
improper.
finally
your
honor,
there
is
the
question
of
use
immunity,
whether
any
statements
that
the
inmate
may
make
at
the
hearing
could
be
used
against
him
at
a
future
time.
as
i
stated
in
my
brief
there
are
some
reasons
for
the
state
actually
to
agree
with
use
immunity
because
it
might
force
the
inmates
to
enter
the
hearings
and
to
tell
their
side
of
the
story.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
i
mean
in
a
future
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
right!
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
that
is
exactly
correct
your
honor.
but
as
a
legal
proposition,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
constitutional
impediment
to
that
testimony
being
used
and
this
issue
really
centers
on
whether
simmons,
this
court's’
opinion,
simmons
applies
here
or
whether
this
court’s
opinion
in
gardner
applies
here.
this
court
has
limited
simmons
in
many
ways
in
recent
years
and
it
is
the
state's
position
that
this
situation
is
much
more
akin
to
that
in
gardner.
in
simmons
there
were
two
constitutional
rights
involved,
the
fourth
and
the
fifth.
here
there
is
only
one
constitutional
right
involved.
whether
the
inmate
is
going
speak,
the
fifth.
that
is
much
more
akin
to
the
situation
in
the
gardner.
the
inmate
faces
a
problem
that
very,
a
person
that
is
committed
a
crime
faces
whether
he
will
claim
the
fifth
or
not
and
there
is
compulsion
in
the
sense
that
it
may
be
in
his
favor
to
talk
to
the
disciplinary
board,
but
that
is
no
different
than
the
compulsion
in
every
criminal
case
and
this
is
not
even
a
criminal
case.
so
it
is
the
state's
position
that
use
immunity
is
not
constitutionally
required
in
this
situation
and
in
fact
there
are
impediments
under
rhode
island
law
to
use
immunity
being
granted
because
generally
it
can
only
be
done
when
attorney
general
applies
to
the
presiding
justice
of
the
superior
court.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
rule
of
evidence,
we
would
have
to
follow
that,
but
it
would
add
another
thing
as
generally
we
would
probably
have
to
have
steno
graphic
transcription
of
all
the
disciplinary
hearings
to
be
sure
exactly
what
we
said,
so
that
we
will
be
careful
not
to
be
using
what
we
said
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
but
there
is
also
a
derivative
using
in
any
claim
to
(inaudible)
your
honor,
so
we
would
have
to
be
careful
that
we
use
none
of
those
statements.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
absolutely
your
honor,
not
transactional
immunity.
when
we
are
talking
about
the
narrow
immunity
considered
by
this
court
in
kastigar
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
absolutely
your
honor
and
we
would
have
to
follow
your
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
it
was
your
honor
except
for
the
counsel
question.
i
mean,
if
this
court
should
feel
that
either
has
to
be
counsel
or
use
immunity,
the
state
will
certainly
prefer
use
immunity
as
it
is
much
of
the
less
of
a
burden
on
the
state.
also
i
think
in
fairness,
your
honors,
i
should
state
that
the
disciplinary
hearings
now
have
become
two
types
of
hearings,
there
is
one
in
which
the
prisoner
comes
in,
discusses
with
board
what
happened
and
he
gives
his
defense
and
there
is
a
second
which
he
comes
in
and
just
stonewalls
the
disciplinary
board
because
he
is
advised
by
the
counsel
not
to
say
anything.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
miranda
requires
an
appointed
counsel.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
it
also
has
an
evidentiary
rule
that
the
statements
may
not
be
used.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
right
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
well,
i
think
what
your
honor
is
getting
at
is
why
do
not
we
just
not
have
lawyers
and
we
have
the
use
immunity
automatically,
but
i
think
the
state
would
feel
that
if
this
court
ruled
it
and
miranda
applied,
we
have
to
supply
lawyers.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
that
is
an
evidentiary
ruling.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
on
the
the
counsel
question
we
maintain
that
these
court's
decision
in
wolff
has
already
determined
that
counsel
are
not
required
at
this
hearings
and
i
guess
the
application
miranda
then
if
wolff
were
considered
to
come
into
the
situation
would
be
that
use
immunity
would
we
have
to
be
provided.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
our
contention
is
that
as
the
constitutional
matter
that
is
not
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
absolutely
your
honor.
whenever
anyone
does
something
illegal
they
have
to
decide
whether
they
are
going
to
fest
up
or
not.
there
is
only
the
fifth
amendment
involved
here.
there
is
no
weighing
of
one
constitutional
right
against
another.
the
first
circuit
handed
down
decision
called
flint
v.
mullen
in
which
it
made
a
similar
determination
on
the
question
of
a
suspension
hearings.
somebody
who
had
been
given
a
suspended
sentence
and
then
was
brought
in
and
of
course
that
is
more
akin
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
but
it
was,
the
court
there
decided
that
there
was
no
constitutional
problem
and
then
it
was
just
a
weighing
problem
for
the
accused
as
to
whether
he
was
going
to
testify
there
or
remain
silent
in
order
to
protect
his
rights
at
the
way
to
a
criminal
trial
for
the
offense
which
he
had
committed.
also
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
case
of
gagnon
v.
scarpelli,
your
honors
considered
the
case
of
somebody
who
had
been
given
a
suspended
sentence,
i
believed
it
was
and
in
that
case
the
accused
had
committed
a
robbery
and
nowhere
did
the
court
when
it
discussed
the
counsel
requirement
there
suggest
that
because
the
accused
there
might
be
subject
to
future
criminal
prosecution,
and
therefore,
miranda
required
the
lawyer
automatically
at
that
hearing.
i
think
that
if
that
is
true
a
fortiori
no
lawyer
should
be
required
at
prison
disciplinary
hearing.
and
also,
in
ultimately
making
a
decision
in
court,
the
court
has
to
make
a
weighing
of
the
rights
of
the
government
versus
an
individual
and
it
is
naturally
the
state's
position
that
there
are
factors
in
prison
that
are
very
different
from
those
in
other
situations,
those
are
protecting
not
only
the
guards,
but
the
inmates
from
each
other
and
that
rapidly
disciplining
is
very
important.
if
lawyers
are
introduced
into
the
disciplinary
hearings
we
have
all
the
problems
of
scheduling,
postponements,
weeks
and
months
before
an
inmate
receives
the
discipline
for
the
infraction
which
he
committed.
i
think
that
many
commentators
have
said
that
one
of
the
problems
with
the
criminal
justice
system
now
is
that
people
that
do
these
things
wait
so
long
before
anything
happens
that
the
purpose
to
make
it
known
that
you
cannot
commit
this
things
is
dispelled
because
of
the
delay.
i
think
it
is
very
important
in
a
prison
that
disciplinary
hearing
follow
very
quickly
in
the
infraction
and
that
is
what
happened
in
palmigiano
situation
and
the
state
feels
that
it
could
do
this
or
rapidly
if
counsel
were
not
required
at
the
hearings.
if
i
have
any
time
i
like
to
reserve
it.
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
yes
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
just
make
two
brief
points.
although
it
is
been
said
that
mr.
palmigiano
was
told
that
his
silence
should
be
used
against
him,
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
note
that
he
was
told
that
it
detrimental
to
his
defense
and
that
the
morris
rules
provide
that
any
finding
must
be
based
on
substantial
evidence.
and
the
state
concedes
that
silence
alone
is
not
substantial
evidence
because
it
obviously
can
be
as
much
consonant
with
innocence
as
it
is
with
guilt
and
--
mr.
ronald
a.
dwight
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
i
have
one
last
point
to
make.
the
respondent
implied
that
one
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
a
jury
must
disregard
the
silence
of
the
defendant,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
states
the
law
correctly
because
in
griffin
this
court
stated
in
the
footnote
that
they
would
reserve
decision
whether
an
accused
could
require
as
in
bruno
that
the
jury
be
instructed
that
his
silence
must
be
disregarded
and
the
bruno
decision
rested
not
on
the
constitutional
grounds,
but
on
a
federal
statute.
thank
you
very
much.
