justice
potter
stewart
so,
your
point
is
in
response
to
footnote
1
on
page
3
of
the
government’s
amicus
curiae
brief
in
this
case
that
this
was
not
an
attack
on
the
state
wide
morris
rules
as
such?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
contrary
to
the
government’s
suggestion
a
three-judge
court
was
not
required
and
that
it
was
properly
heard
and
determined
by
a
single
district
judge,
therefore,
the
appeal
is
proper
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
certiorari
of
the
jurisdiction
exists
in
this
court,
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
understand
it
was
not
to
analogize
the
disciplinary
preceding
to
a
criminal
trial,
but
rather
to
analogize
the
disciplinary
preceding
to
the
in
custody
interrogation
of
miranda,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
miranda
situation,
let
us
say
if
it
is
the
person
being
interrogated
as
a
pauper
then
his
counsel
is
being
employed
by
the
state,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
only
if
the
law
were
settled
that
at
any
subsequent
criminal
prosecution,
any
statement
that
he
had
made
to
disciplinary
proceeding
would
in
fact
be
inadmissible,
you
have
the
same
result
without
your
problem
of
granting
use
immunity
by
those
unauthorized
events,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
use
immunity
would
just
be
forbidding
question,
did
you
not
testify
at
the
disciplinary
hearing
a,
b,
c
and
d?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
use
immunity
and
there
is
transactional
immunity,
we
are
talking
about
here
about
using
it?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
most,
would
not
the,
if
the
law
were
established
that
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
evidence
perhaps
required
by
the
constitution
that
any
incriminating
thing
that
he
might
have
said
at
the
disciplinary
hearings
would
not
and
could
not
as
a
matter
of
evidentiary
law
of
the
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
be
admitted,
that
would
be
and
if
that
were
the
law
and
if
he
were
advised
of
that,
that
would
be
the
equivalent
of
use
immunity,
i
suppose
with
out
getting
into
all
the
complications
that
you
suggest
about
these
prison
officials
not
being
authorized
under
state
law
to
grant
use
immunity.
they
certainly
would
be
authorized
to
advise
him
what
the
state
of
the
law
was?
justice
potter
stewart
miranda
did
not
lay
down
a
substantive
requirement
of
constitutional
law.
miranda
just
said
that
incriminating
statements
would
be
inadmissible
at
the
defendant’s
trial
unless
certain
safeguards
would
have
been
provided
at
the
time
those
incriminating
statements
were
made.
it
did
not
require
any
such
safeguard.
it
is
just
the
rule
of
exclusion
of
evidence,
was
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
had
it
been,
in
fact,
certified
as
class
action?
justice
potter
stewart
i
got
the
first
point,
i
am
not
sure
i
got
the
second.
first
is
the
same
as
we
heard
at
the
previous
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
confrontation
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
does
not
do
that
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law.
miranda
simply
says
what
may
not
be
admitted
in
a
criminal
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right.
it
does
not
say
what
the
state
has
to
do
or
does
not
have
to
do,
interrogation
of
anybody,
it
has
to
do
with
what
can
be
admitted
in
a
criminal
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
clutchette
now?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
case
is
moot
as
to
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
no
question
in
that?
justice
potter
stewart
very
well,
is
it
or
is
it
not
moot
as
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
but
there
is
now
a
named
intervening
plaintiff,
who
was
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
makes
no
difference
now
with
respect
to
clutchette
that
he
is
--
that
the
actual
hearing
he
had
did
not
comply
with
requirements
in
wolff?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
said
it
was
moot
as
to
clutchette,
now
it
either
is
or
it
is
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
because
of
the
evidence
against
him,
is
it
not?
that
he
was
silent,
because
of
what
is
the
evidence
(voice
overlap)
justice
stewart
or
it
maybe
subject
to
criminal
prosecution?
mr.
stein
you
have
just
a
few
minutes.
justice
stewart
but
why
do
agree
--
what
is
the
difficult
choice?
justice
stewart
why
would
it?
if
it
is
going
to
get
him
out
of
disciplinary
infraction,
why
we
are
getting
into
a
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
he
might
charged
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
thing
he
is
going
to
say
because
of
the
way
of
the
disciplinary
proceeding
is
something
that
he
thinks
is
going
to
help
him?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
probably
not
going
to
be
incriminating,
is
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
is
it
so
inevitably
such
a
difficult
choice?
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
you
conceded
too
much?
