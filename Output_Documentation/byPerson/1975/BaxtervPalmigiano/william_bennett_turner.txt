mr.
william
bennett
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
the
type
of
misconduct
that
is
punishable
within
a
prison
or
as
to
the
type
of
punishment
that
can
be
imposed
by
prison
officials.
the
issue
here
involves
the
reliability
of
the
fact
finding
process
used
within
the
prison
and
only
in
very
serious
cases
in
which
there
is
a
dispute
about
the
fact.
we
are
not
dealing
in
this
case
with
any
emergency
situation
and
court
below
specifically
said
that
prison
officials
always
have
the
discretion
to
isolate
any
disrupted
prisoner
without
any
hearing.
these
disciplinary
proceedings
involved
in
this
case
are
those
that
can
substantially
alter
a
man's
condition
of
confinement
and
prolong
his
term
of
incarceration.
now,
it
is
also
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
whether
the
procedures
that
were
used
at
the
time
this
case
was
brought,
meet
constitutional
standard
because
they
clearly
do
not.
none
of
the
safeguards
that
this
court
required
in
the
wolff
case
were
followed
in
1970
when
this
case
was
brought
and
of
course
california
does
not
contend
that
they
were
in
compliance
then.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
because
the
relief
that
is
sought
in
this
case
is
not
release,
it
is
not
earlier
release,
there
is
no
challenge
in
this
case
to
the
fact
or
duration
of
confinement.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
there
was
a
part
of
the
judgment
which
has
never
been
carried
out
because
it
is
been
stated,
it
was
to
expunge
the
disciplinary
records
in
this
case.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that,
that
would
lead
to
release
of
either
of
these
men.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
not
necessarily.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
remotely.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
because
preiser
says
that
a
1983
action
is
barred
only
when
the
fact
or
duration
of
confinement
is
being
challenged
and
immediate
or
earlier
release
is
being
sought.
now,
in
wolff,
this
case
is
actually
covered
by
wolff
because
the
only
relief
that
is
sought
in
this
case,
is
an
injunction
against
the
perspective
enforcement
of
prison
rules.
it
is
exactly
like
wolff
in
that
respect,
footnote
1
in
the
wolff
decision
covers
it.
there
is
also
not
properly
before
this
court,
the
constitutionality
of
the
current
procedures
that
are
being
used
in
san
quentin
because
the
plan
that
is
currently
in
use
was
not
before
the
ninth
circuit.
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
new
evidence,
discovery
taken
in
the
district
court
and
the
matter
is
under
submission
in
the
district
court.
judge
zerppley
(ph)
has
not
yet
ruled
on
any
aspect
of
the
new
plan
and
there
is
indeed
considerable
dispute
about
how
the
new
plan
actually
operates
in
practice.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
mean
by
that
your
honor,
the
plan
which
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no.
the
plan
that
the
officials
formally
submitted
to
comply
with
judge
zerppley's
(ph)
order.
their
current
plan
is
in
the
record
at
page
296,
beginning
at
page
296,
that
is
the
plan
that
they
are
operating
under
now
and
there
is
been
no
ruling
by
the
district
court
or
by
the
ninth
circuit
about
the
adequacy
of
the
provisions
of
that
plan.
i
take
it
then
that
the
issue
that
the
court
granted
certiorari
for,
is
to
consider
whether
the
ninth
circuit
required
that
when
the
plan
is
ruled
upon
by
the
district
court
that
that
plan
would
be
required
to
have
too
much
due
process
in
it
and
i
take
it
that
is
the
state's
complaint.
of
course
the
state
relies
largely
on
the
wolff
decision.
we
do
not
believe
that
wolff
can
be
read
as
controlling
every
aspect
of
this
case.
in
first
place
the
court
said
that
its
conclusions
there
were
not
graven
in
stone
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
quite
a
different
set
of
circumstances
--
well,
there
are
different
circumstances
here
than
they
were
in
the
nebraska
prisons,
involving
wolff
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
i
think
they
clearly
have
to
follow
wolff,
but
they
have
to
follow
wolff
only
insofar
as
wolff
actually
holds
one
thing
or
another.
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
of
course
true.
the
primary
distinguishing
factor
here,
between
the
situation
in
wolff
is
california’s
unique
indeterminate
sentence
law
where
the
ranges
of
sentences
is,
so
for
example,
in
clutchette’s
case,
his
sentence
for
second
degree
burglary
was
six
months
to
15
years
and
most
of
the
common
felonies
carry
sentences
of,
from
five
years
to
life.
the
adult
authority
which
does
the
actual
sentencing
and
set
parole
dates
as
well
as
maximum
sentences
usually
meets
a
prisoner
on
an
annual
basis
and
either
sets
a
date
or
does
not
set
a
date,
but
every
disciplinary
infraction
must
be
referred
to
the
adult
authority
for
consideration
at
that
time.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
clutchette
is
on
parole,
he
was
paroled
in
1972.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
unless
he
is
re
incarcerated,
he
would
be
entitled
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes
he
is,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
relief
here
individually.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
alejandro
ferro
who
was
joined
as
a
party
plaintiff
in
1972
and
who
is
still
incarcerated
at
the
san
quentin.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right.
i
suppose
he
might
theoretically
be
interested
in
expunction.
there
is
a
damage
claim
which
he
made
which
has
never
been
formally
abandoned,
but
i
doubt
seriously
that
it
would
not
be
pursued.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
think
for
present
purposes
the
court
may
consider
that
claimed
abandoned,
as
to
him.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
that
is
unclear
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
the
district
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
in
the
district
courts
opinion,
it
said,
judge
zerppley
(ph)
said
that
the
case
is
brought
as
a
class
action
under
rule
23
(b)
(1)
and
(b)
(2)
and
clearly
all
the
requirements
were
met.
there
was
no
separate
motion
to
certify
the
class.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
should
think
so,
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
class
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
he
is
a
party
plaintiff
not
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
he
has
standing
to
raise
all
of
the
issues
here,
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference
in
view
of
the
other
plaintiff
who
does
have
standing.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
bennett
turner
all
prisoners
at
san
quentin,
that
is
how
the
class
was
defined
in
the
initial
complaint.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
but
they
maybe
at
anytime
and
any
moment
of
any
day,
they
are
subject
to
being
called
before
the
disciplinary
board
on
very
serious
charges.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
adult
authority
does
not
hold
its
own
fact
finding
hearings.
it
relies
on
hearing
that
was
conducted
in
the
prison
and
this
is
what
means
that
the
consequences
of
what
happens
to
the
disciplinary
hearing
are
very
serious
because
as
the
california
supreme
court
has
held
a
single
disciplinary
infraction
is
sufficient
cause
to
deny
parole
or
to
rescind
the
parole
date
which
is
previously
have
been
granted.
that
is
why
the
supreme
court's
case
in
rodriguez
mentioned
by
counsel
does
not
make
any
difference
because
when
they
set
a
tentative
parole
date,
they
can
then
rescind
it
on
the
basis
of
a
disciplinary
offense
and
make
a
man
serve
a
whole
lot
longer
in
prison
as
a
result.
it
is
the
difference
between
being
paroled
next
month
and
possibly
five
years
from
now
when
your
maximum
sentence
expires.
the
indeterminate
sentence
has
particular
relevance
where
the
charge
against
the
man
is
criminal
in
nature
where
as
in
clutchette’s
case
he
is
charged
with
assault
on
an
officer
and
that
is
fairly
heavy
felony
under
the
california
law.
in
that
kind
of
case,
the
state
has
an
effective
option
of
how
to
deal
with
the
man.
it
can
achieve
further
incarceration,
additional
incarceration,
either
by
following
through
in
the
criminal
process
or
can
do
the
very
same
thing
through
the
adult
authority
with
far
less
procedural
ceremony.
summarily
they
can
make
the
man
serve
far
longer.
the
issue
to
be
tried
of
course
in
these
disciplinary
proceeding
is
the
same
issue
that
would
be
tried
in
a
criminal
trial.
did
the
man
or
not
commit
the
criminal
act?
the
courts
below
properly
held
that
the
san
quentin
procedure
that
was
used
when
this
case
was
brought
failed
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
this
is
because
the
man
is
faced
with
incurring
a
very
serious
and
immediate
punishment
if
he
does
not
speak
in
his
own
defense.
he
has
no
adequate
alternative
means
of
defense
besides
speaking
for
himself.
at
this
time
in
san
quentin,
he
had
no
right
to
call
any
witnesses,
he
could
not
cross
examine
anybody,
he
had
no
counsel,
he
had
no
counsel
substitute,
he
was
left
wholly
on
his
own.
the
sole
means
of
defending
himself
was
to
explain
his
situation,
but
how
could
he
do
that
and
also
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
privilege,
is
that
dilemma
that
the
ninth
circuit
addressed
itself
to
and
of
course
the
dilemma
is
doubly
difficult
for
the
prisoner
because
he
does
not
have
the
advice
of
counsel.
there
is
nobody
there
to
advise
him
on
the
intricacies
of
the
fifth
amendment,
rather
there
is
any
realistic
risk
of
prosecution
as
a
result
of
this
event
or
whether
what
he
wants
to
say
might
tend
to
incriminate
him
and
it
is
just
not
accurate
to
say
that
prisoners
at
san
quentin
can
routinely
consult
with
counsel.
i
have
heard
of
very
few
san
quentin
prisoners
who
have
access
to
counsel.
as
the
court
must
recognize
virtually
all
of
them
are
indigent.
the
only
reason
clutchette
had
counsel
was
because
he
was
at
this
time
already
under
indictment
for
a
felony,
an
in
prison
felony
in
california
and
that
is
the
only
reason
he
had
counsel
and
could
consult
with
him.
so
the
situation
facing
the
prisoner
in
these
disciplinary
hearings
is
either
he
has
to
forfeit
his
only
means
of
defense,
the
right
to
speak
in
his
own
behalf
or
he
has
to
waive
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
this
conflicts
we
submit
with
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court
most
recently
lefkowitz
and
the
earlier
cases
that
say
a
state
cannot
penalize
the
exercise
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
cannot
coerce
people
to
give
incriminating
testimony
against
themselves.
it
does
not
make
any
difference
that
formally,
in
this
case,
the
prisoner
is
not
being
punished
for
taking
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
there
is
an
inference
drawn
from
his
silence
because
he
does
not
have
any
other
means
of
defending
himself.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right
and
here
if
he
does
not
talk,
he
for
sure
gets
the
disciplinary
punishment.
there
is
really
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
it
is
not
for
being
silent,
because
of
being
silent,
because
he
has
no
other
defense.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
question
is
whether
he
is
required
to
forfeit
all
defense,
his
only
defense,
whether
due
process
can
count
on
the
stat.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
there
were
written
statements
filed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
but
i
do
not
how
many
there
were?
mr.
william
bennett
turner
he
was
not
shown
any
of
those
statements
of
course
whether
reporting
against
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
doubt
about
that.
as
they
do
in
most
cases
but
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
it
is
not
for
this
reason
your
honor.
in
mcnaughton
the
accused
have
the
most
elaborate
procedural
protections
known
under
our
law.
he
had
the
lawyer,
he
had
the
presumption
of
innocence,
state
required
to
prove
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
trial
before
jury,
drawn
from
a
cross
action
of
the
community,
his
counsel
as
the
court
went
out
of
the
way
to
say
could
do
everything
that
they
accused
himself
wanted
to
do
in
a
way
of
explaining
mitigating
circumstances
to
the
jury.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
he
had
to
make
that
choice,
but
the
point
is
that
if
he
made
the
choice
to
remain
silent,
he
was
still
not
without
means
of
defense
whereas
the
prisoner
in
the
situation
has
nothing
going
for
him
other
than
the
right
to
speak
in
his
own
behalf.
everybody
agrees
that
due
process
says
that
you
have
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
your
own
defense,
but
he
cannot
have
it
here
if
he
wants
to
take
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
because
he
maybe
concerned
about
protecting
himself
in
a
later
criminal
prosecution.
if
he
wants
to
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
privilege,
that
means
he
cannot
defend
himself
in
the
hearing.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
the
point
is
if
he
does
not
do
something
at
the
disciplinary
hearing,
he
is
going
to
be
punished
by
the
tribunal
there.
that
punishment
may
include
an
immediate
dose
of
solitary
confinement,
the
other
punishments
that
available
in
california
as
well
as
an
increased
term
of
imprisonment
when
the
adult
authority
takes
a
look
at
him.
so
he
has
got
to
make
up
his
mind
right
then
and
there
whether
he
is
going
to
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
the
difference
is
because
of
the
fifth
amendment.
he
may
not
want
to
take
the
risk
of
saying
something
that
would
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
it
is
both
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
but
this
case
is
different
from
wolff
because
of
the
possibility
of
criminal
prosecution
and
he
has
to
do
one
of
two
things,
either
take
the
fifth
or
defend
him
self.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
have
been
told
that
in
the
district
court,
the
prisoners
offer
evidence
that
they
have
been
accused
of
things
which
could
have
been
considered
crimes,
but
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
neither
briefed
nor
argued
by
any
party
here
that
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
problem
in
the
case
and
it
is
not
adverted
to
in
the
court's
decision
in
any
way.
i
suppose
if
i
am
wrong
in
my
reading
of
wolff
will
find
out
about
the
decision
of
this
case,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
factors
involved
here
are
so
much
different
from
wolff
when
you
have
the
specter
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
fully
protecting
the
man's
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
do
not
think
the
record
shows
one
way
or
another
on
that,
but
assuming
he
could
walk
away
from
it
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
he
is
giving
up
any
defense
to
the
disciplinary
infraction
and
he
has
to
take
the
consequence
that
they
have.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
can
stop
at
anytime,
but
then
suffer
the
consequence
of
disciplinary
punishment.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
think
the
distinguishing
factors
are
two.
analytically,
it
seems
to
make
a
difference
in
the
court's
decisions
whether
the
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
this
court.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
wolf
and
lefkowitz
and
mcnaughton
and
all
of
the
decisions
that
deal
with
these
various
issues.
if
the
person
is
going
to
suffer
serious
consequences
that
may
not
make
the
difference,
but
if
he
has
no
alternative
means
of
defending
himself,
that
will,
that
is
if
the
person
is
going
to
suffer
grievous
harm,
if
he
does
not
defend
himself
and
if
there
is
no
other
means
of
defending
himself.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
then
there
is
a
serious
problem.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
only
meant
to
say
speak
because
that
is
all
that
the
prisoner
has
going
for
him,
at
least
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried.
his
only
means
of
defense,
he
could
not
call
any
witnesses,
his
only
means
of
defense
was
what
he
could
say
to
explain
with
the
charge.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
because
if
he
could
for
example
if
his
defense
was,
i
was
there,
but
it
was
the
man
next
to
me
who
hit
the
guard.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
but
saying
that
he
was
there
may
incriminate
him
in
a
criminal
trial
and
maybe
an
important
piece
of
evidence
against
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
in
the
criminal
trial?
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right
he
does
not
give
up
any
defense
in
the
criminal
trial.
if
he
refuses
to
answer
the
question
then
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
it
is
not
the
usual
conducted
under
oath.
the
issue
before
the
court
has
been
so
much
mis-characterized.
it
is
not
whether
counsel
has
to
be
provided
in
these
proceedings.
it
is
whether
some
kind
of
special
precautions
have
be
taken
because
of
the
--
to
the
collision
of
two
constitutional
rights.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
some
kind
of
special
precautions,
well,
the
ninth
circuit
specified
three.
first
it
said
that
the
state
can
postpone
disciplinary
proceedings.
now,
that
is
fine
and
doable
if
the
state
is
not
warning
to
impose
segregation
or
some
kind
of
disciplinary
like
punishment
while
the
case
is
pending
in
criminal
court
and
that
is
many,
but
definitely
not
all
of
the
cases.
in
many
of
the
cases,
the
state
is
going
to
say
no
we
do
not
want
to
wait
until
the
criminal
proceeding
is
over.
well,
then
the
ninth
circuit
said
yes,
that
the
state
can
hold
a
hearing
and
then
it
has
the
choice
between
providing
counsel
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
or
providing
use
immunity.
use
immunity
is
a
very
simple
and
workable
solution
in
these
circumstances.
it
would
eliminate
the
problem
essentially
because
the
man
could
testify
freely
and
what
he
says
could
not
be
used
against
him
and
would
eliminate
the
need
for
counsel
there,
but
the
ninth
circuit
as
i
read
the
decision
left
it
up
to
the
state
to
make
that
choice.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
state
could
do
that
because
it
would
then
be
openly
compelling
testimony
and
can
do
so
as
long
as
it
immunizes
the
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
i
don
not
think
that
makes
a
crucial
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right.
i
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
idea.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
in
this
case,
the
defense
was
clearly
going
to
be
self
defense
and
he
is
giving
up
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
not
in
that
case,
but
to
go
any
step
beyond
that
might
get
him
in
very
deep
trouble
and
assaulting
an
officer
in
the
california
prison
under
the
california
penal
code
is
a
very
serious
felony
and
he
should
not
been
put
to
that
choice
between
either
saying
nothing
or
giving
up
the
fifth
amendment.
this
choice
that
the
prisoners
are
confronted
with,
cannot
be
postponed
under
the
criminal
trial
to
see
whether
what
he
says
might
be
admitted
or
might
not
be
admitted
in
evidence.
the
constitutional
violation
occurs
that
the
hearing
where
he
is
required
to
forfeit
one
right
or
the
other.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
only
at
the
trial,
at
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
not
in
an
individual
case,
that
would
clearly
be
a
matter
for
the
states
courts
to
deal
with
on
the
criminal
prosecution.
there
are
several
other
issues
in
this
case.
i
intend
to
touch
only
on
the
other
major
issue
which
involves
the
right
of
confrontation
or
cross
examination
and
of
course
there
was
no
such
right
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried
in
california
prisons.
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
light
of
the
decision
in
wolff,
holding
that
there
is
no
general
right
of
cross
examination,
but
that
this
would
be
committed
to
the
discretion
of
prison
officials.
the
ninth
circuit
simply
prescribed
a
method
by
which
arbitrariness
could
be
controlled
and
said
every
time
you
deny
cross
examination,
put
your
reason
on
the
record.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
no
quarrel
with
the
requirement
that
they
record
reasons
for
denying
cross
examination.
that
present
plan
does
exactly
that
and
they
have
been
leaving
unto
that
plan
now
for
about
three-and-a-half
years.
now,
what
they
do
complain
about
is
that
the
reasons
given
authorized
by
the
ninth
circuit
are
not
brought
enough.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
we
do
not
think
that
wolff
can
be
read
as
a
declaration
by
this
court
that
never
in
any
circumstances
can
there
be
a
right
of
cross
examination.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
oh,
i
think
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
wolf.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
your
honor
it
was
not
a
remand.
the
court
agreed
itself
to
rehear
it
in
light
of
wolff
and
it
is
giving
its
own
reading
to
wolff
and
every
other
court
to
address
this
issue
since
wolff
has
done
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
think
the
reason
the
courts
are
doing
that
is
because
they
read
wolff
carefully
and
see
that
in
wolff,
nebraska
in
fact
permitted
a
limited
right
of
cross
examination.
the
prisoner
was
allowed
to
meet
with
the
charging
party
and
then
at
the
hearing
itself
to
ask
the
charging
party
questions.
so
there
was
a
limited
right
of
cross
examination
in
wolff
itself.
then
what
the
court
said
that
went
beyond
that
was
not
really
necessary
to
the
decision
there,
but
probably
more
important
than
that
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
if
wolff
can
be
read
as
saying
there
is
never
right
of
cross
examination,
that
certainly
would
not
have
been
necessary
to
decision.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
and
that
is
not
what
the
court
said
here
either.
all
they
said
is
do
what
the
state
is
doing
now
and
that
is
provide
reasons
so
that
you
can
see
whether
the
people
are,
whether
the
officials
are
dealing
fairly
with
prisoners
in
these
situations.
in
wolff
the
district
court
in
that
case
feeling
itself
bound
by
then
existing
eighth
circuit
precedent
did
not
take
any
evidence
whatever
on
whether
a
limited
right
of
cross
examination
is
workable
and
the
problems
that
might
result
if
it
were
used.
we
think
that
this
is
a
matter
that
is
susceptible
of
proof
and
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
before
the
district
court
gives
final
approval
to
any
rules,
there
ought
to
be
an
opportunity
to
take
testimony
on
these
problems
because
after
all
a
large
number
of
states,
28
states
according
to
the
aba
survey,
implement
some
kind
of
cross
examination
rights,
some
kind
of
confrontation.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
right
and
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well
no,
i
certainly
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
proper
in
this
case
and
that
decision
not
to
be
affirmed
so
that
the
case
can
go
back
down
to
the
district
court
finally
to
dispose
on
what
due
process
requires
in
this
case.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
we
do
not
go
that
far
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
--
that
the
ninth
circuit
gave
the
state
options,
three
options
of
dealing
with
the
situation
providing
special
precautions
at
the
hearing.
one
is
to
postpone
the
hearing
until
you
see
whether
the
district
attorney
is
going
to
prosecute
until
the
trail
is
concluded.
that
obviously
eliminates
the
problem
expect
when
the
state
wants
to
take
immediate
action
and
they
may
well
be
able
to
leave
with
postponement
in
many
cases,
but
where
it
wants
to
take
immediate
action
and
hold
the
hearing
then
the
two
options,
either
counsel
or
use
immunity
and
the
ninth
circuit
would
permit
either
one.
that
is
why
the
issue
that
is
before
this
court
is
not
simply
whether
counsel
has
to
be
provided.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that
is
correct.
