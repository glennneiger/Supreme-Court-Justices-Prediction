chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
baxter
against
palmigiano.
mr.
dwight
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
civil
case,
if
the
witness
whether
a
party
or
not
refuses
to
answer
a
question
on
the
grounds
of
possible
incrimination,
fifth
amendment
grounds,
and
if
the
opposing
counsel
points
to
that
in
his
closing
argument,
does
that
violate
any
provision
of
the
constitution
in
the
civil
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
we
are
talking
about
the
constitution.
is
there
any
reason
why
the
lawyer
in
arguing
the
case
cannot
point
to
that
witness,
let
us
say
he
is
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
say
you
heard
ask
him
this
question
and
he
declined
to
answer
and
i
suggest
to
you
he
declined
to
answer
and
then
undertakes
to
get
an
explanation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
constitutional
impediment
to
that
all,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
substantially
the
equivalent
of
a
miranda
rule
applied
to
this
setting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
is
the
distinction
between
the
use
immunity
that
you
have
been
discussing
and
the
application
or
in
effect
the
miranda
doctrine
to
this
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
the
law
requires.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
no
counsel,
you
cannot
use
the
statements.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
do
you
equate
that
to
use
immunity,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fortunato.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
you,
is
that
by
virtue
of
a
rule
or
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
very
many
inmates
in
rhode
island
who
are
not
indigents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
provision
in
the
constitution
do
you
suggest
requires
then
the
prison
authorities
to
tell
the
inmate
that
his
silence
will
not
be
taken
into
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
case
that
is
ever
held
that
you
can
say
to
us
that
tells
us
that
he
must
be
affirmatively
told
that
his
silence
will
not
be
used
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
be
proceeding
all
along
the
assumption
that
the
inmate
does
not
want
to
answer
any
questions,
perhaps
he
wants
to
answer
some
questions
on
the
complain.
now,
do
you
suggest
that
if
he
voluntarily
wishes
to
explain
some
of
the
--
some
parts
of
the
episode
that
he
must
have
a
lawyer
there
to
guide
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
going
back
to
the
realities
as
justice
brennan
i
think
described
them,
is
there
any
area
of
contest
inquiry,
whether
civil
or
criminal,
where
a
defaulting
party
does
not
have
his
default
in
reality
work
against
him?
do
you
of
any
such
area
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
maybe
because
of
the
weakness
of
the
evidence
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
notice
to
the
inmate
who
has
been
guilty
of
this
infraction
informs
him
that
an
informal
hearing
will
be
held
at
a
particular
day
and
hour
in
relation
to
the
episode
that
is
in
question
and
that
he
may
come
if
he
wishes
and
if
he
comes,
he
may
state
his
position.
if
he
wishes,
but
he
will
not
be
compelled
to
answer
any
questions
and
then
he
comes
to
take
either
choice.
he
stays
away
or
he
comes
and
sits
silent.
do
you
suggest
that
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
of
guards
and
other
inmates,
he
cannot
be
subjected
to
discipline
unless
he
has
a
lawyer
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
the
prison
authorities
necessarily
know
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
subject,
perhaps
he
will
and
perhaps
he
will
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
crime
of,
if
it
is
a
crime
in
the
state
of
inciting
a
riot
or
creating
a
disturbance
maybe
a
rather
settled
thing
in
some
cases
and
perhaps
they
do
not
know
at
that
time
whether
any
such
criminal
procedure
is
going
to
take
place
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
go
back
to
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
and
the
man
does
not
come
at
all.
he
elects
not
to
come
and
they
hear
the
guards
and
the
other
inmates
who
describe
his
conduct
and
then
they
say,
you
are
going
to
be
put
in
solitary
confinement
for
21
days
and
they
cannot
do
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
he
comes
to
this
informal
hearing
and
remains
in
the
chair
silent.
he
is
offered
an
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
and
he
responds
that
he
does
not
want
to
make
a
statement
or
answer
any
questions
and
then
they
proceed
to
do
the
same
thing,
any
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
he
has
not
made
statements
in
my
second
hypothetical.
he
made
no
statement.
he
is
in
invited
to
make
any
statement
he
wishes
and
he
answers
that
he
has
no
statement
to
make
and
that
he
does
not
want
to
answer
any
questions.
he
mute
except
for
that
statement
declining
to
make
a
any
utterance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
for
the
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
have
about
three
minutes
remaining
after
lunch
if
you
have
anything
further
we
will
adjourn
now
until
1
oâ€™clock.
you
may
continue
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
enomoto
against
clutchette.
mr.
stein
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
no
question
about
this
status
of
the
facts,
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court
originally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
isolation
was
carried
out
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
stein.
mr.
turner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
his
claim
is
when
you
compensate
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
everything
the
ninth
circuit
ordered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
fundamentally
is
very
much
different
than
the
decision
made
by
defendant
in
a
full
criminal
case
that
he
will
not
take
the
stand
after
there
has
been
overwhelming
evidence
against
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
court's
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
wolff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
if
he
does
not
defend
himself,
you
mean
if
he
does
not
speak
or
do
you
mean
if
he
does
not
come
in
with
a
full
scale
effort
to
meet
the
evidence
of
a
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
for
them,
if
they
give
a
use
immunity
to
couple
with
that
a
requirement
that
all
his
statements
to
be
under
oath
and
subject
to
the
penalties
of
perjury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
more
or
less
compelling
whether
he
is
under
oath
or
not
under
oath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
difference
is
that
in
one
case
he
maybe
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
for
perjury,
is
it
not,
and
that
might
keep
the
whole
proceeding
on
the
track
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
spoke
in
response
to
justice
wright
about
his
giving
up
something,
if
14
witnesses
have
placed
him
at
the
scene.
what
do
you
suggest
he
is
giving
up
when
he
responds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
would
not
incriminate
him
just
to
say
he
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
way
it
does
but
where
it
may,
is
not
that
qualification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-1187,
baxter
against
palmigianon
and
the
related
case,
74-1194,
enomoto
against
clutchette
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
