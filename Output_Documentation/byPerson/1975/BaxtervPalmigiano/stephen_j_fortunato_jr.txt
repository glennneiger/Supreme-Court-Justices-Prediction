mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
first
responding
to
a
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
powell
regarding
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
person
can
absent
himself
from
the
hearing.
my
answer
to
that
is
no,
not
when
he
is
charged
with
a
serious
in-prison
infarction.
i
address
myself
to
this
problem
at
page
11
of
my
brief,
footnote
3.
i
contend
that
the
reading
of
the
morris
rules
in
the
appendix
will
indicate
there
is
a
distinction
between
minor
infractions
and
major
infractions,
not
for
the
minor
infraction,
i
excuse
me
for
the
major
infraction
as
we
had
here
he
could
not
have
absented
himself.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
the
provisions
of
the
morris
rules.
i
would
also
suggest
that
i
was
counsel
present
here
in
the
record
before
the
court
so
indicates
and
the
only
thing
that
the
disciplinary
board
advised
us
when
we
raised
the
counsel
question
immediately
seeking
entrance
into
the
disciplinary
hearing
was
that
they
would
consider
a
postponement
to
consider
our
position,
but
there
was
no
indication
of
any
sort
that,
well,
why
does
not
palmigiano
just
go
sit
this
one
out
and
we
will
proceed
accordingly.
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
that
we
seek
no
extension
of
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
in
disciplinary
hearings.
we
are
not
contending
that
sufficient
time
has
a
elapsed
from
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
so
that
this
court
may
now
reconsider
whether
such
circumstances
have
changed,
so
that
additional
safeguard
should
be
afforded
at
the
in-prison
process.
in
seeking
the
ingress
of
counsel
into
these
proceedings,
we
are
not
asking
that
counsel
be
permitted
to
cross
examine,
to
challenge
the
composition
of
the
board,
to
assist
the
inmate
in
the
presentation
of
his
case
as
such,
but
solely
to
be
there
if
there
is
to
be
interrogation
and
if
in
fact
a
criminal
prosecution
is
threatened.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
clearly,
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
we
would
analogize
this
to
the
miranda,
mathis
situation
the
in-custody
interrogation
and
submit
that
a
where
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
the
lawyer
would
sit
there
so
long
as
there
was
to
be
interrogation,
a
relative
to
a
possible
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
as
a
lawyer
would
do
at
police
precinct
upon
being
summoned
by
the
police
or
via
phone
call.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
do
not
answer
this,
perhaps
you
would
be
wise
to
answer
this
question
and
spare
your
self
further
aggravations
just
as
i
think
was
indicated
in
miranda
that
that
would
be
one
of
the
functions
of
the
attorney
not
always
to
say,
be
silent,
but
from
time
to
time
speak.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
do,
i
do
not
believe
that
a
non-lawyer
assistant
is
sufficiently
trained
to
make
the
careful
distinctions
regarding
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
issue
was
now
before
the
court,
but
i
would
be
constrained
to
say
that
if
he
cannot
retain
in
this
court,
we
will
ultimately
find
itself,
i
think
called
upon
to
say
that
the
indigent
must
have
a
counsel.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
not
too
many,
so
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem,
but
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
just
during
the
interrogation
of
the
inmate.
we
do
not
seek
any
extension
of
counsels’
role.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
we
have
a
qualitatively
different
situation
because
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
but
only
there,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
no,
because
he
is
aware
of
the
charge.
the
morris
rules
are
salubrious
and
insofar
as
they
insist
that
the
man
be
told
in
notice
that
what
he
did
may
result
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
so
we
had
notice
that
he
was
charged
with
a
crime.
he
was
also
told
to
consult
with
his
attorney
which
he
of
course
did
and
it
was
only
we
got
to
the
hearing
as
the
record
indicates
that
we
were
excluded.
now
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
the
first
circuit
said
that
the
morris
rules
cannot
be
construed
as
filling
all
the
constitutional
gaps,
and
therefore,
we
are
here
now
contending
that
due
process
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
in
some
cases
they
may
well
do
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
do
that.
i
would
suggest
that
the
constitution
requires
and
the
proper
effectuation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
requires
that
counsel
be
present.
now,
one
possible
way
of
solving
the
problem
would
be
the
grant
of
use
immunity.
however,
as
counsel
for
the
state
pointed
out,
the
prison
disciplinary
board
is
not
empowered
to
make
such
a
grant.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
if
they
said
that
we
will
not
interrogate
and
if
they
also
said
we
will
not
consider
his
silence
against
him
then
i
would
be
forced
to
concede
that
counsel
perhaps
should
not
be
included
in
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
apparent
--
yes,
if
you
are
only
dealing
in
a
situation
where
and
i
do
not
believe
wolff
addressed
this
question
where
there
is
no
criminal
prosecution
threatened.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes,
i
am
aware
of
that
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
certainly
the
holding
of
wolff.
i
would
merely
submit
that
by
a
listing
in
footnote
20,
numerous
cases
around
the
country
that
the
court
was
not
commenting
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
merits
of
those
cases.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
due
process
notions
of
effectuating
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
not
that
it
says
that
his
silence
will
not
be
used
against
him,
but
i
do
not
think
that
he
can
be
compelled
and
this
is
where
we
get
to
the
issue
of
a
compulsion
of
this
custodial
interrogation,
that
is
palmigiano
was
told,
yeah,
sure
you
can
be
silent.
he
was
also,
i
think,
it
is
somewhat
mislead
by
being
told
that
if
you
speak
it
will
not
be
used
in
the
court
of
law,
but
in
any
event,
he
was
told
your
silence
will
be
held
against
you
if
you
do
not
choose
to
speak.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
honor,
and
your
honors
colloquy
with
the
attorney
general,
i
think
that
in
a
civil
proceeding
there
is
no
prejudice
of
a
constitutional
dimension
for
failure
to
call
a
witness
forward
and
certainly
you
can
comment
to
the
jury,
let
us
note
here
the
absence
of
such
and
such
a
witness
or
somebody’s
failure
to
even
to
be
present
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes,
but
i
think
you
have
a
qualitatively
different
situation
here
when
we
keep
our
eye
on
the
future
criminal
prosecution
and
we
argue
along
the
line
of
gardner
versus
broderick
and
lefkowitz
that
even
though
the
disciplinary
proceeding
itself
is
a
civil,
non-criminal,
if
you
will,
proceeding,
nonetheless
at
that
point
the
tribunal’s
decision
to
use
his
silence
is
substantive
evidence
against
him
acted
as
a
compulsion.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
perhaps
i
can
answer
this
question
by
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes.
there
is
somewhat
of
a
difference,
but
i
do
not
think
that
would
change
my
position.
what
i
mean
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
well,
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
i
certainly
agree
with
the
position
of
the
state
and
various
opinions
of
this
court
which
point
out
that
an
election
between
two
constitutional
rights
cannot
always
leave
person
having
his
cake
and
eating
it
too.
i
mean,
there
are
penalties
that
one
suffers,
however,
i
think
here
if
he
elects
to
remains
silence
--
silent,
he
forgoes
of
course
his
due
process
right
to
speak
in
his
own
defense.
he
may
live
to
regret
that
decision
as
a
tactic
or
as
a
stratagem.
he
may
go
to
the
trial,
take
the
stand
there,
let
us
say
in
a
self-defense
case
and
get
an
acquittal,
maybe
he
will
then
regret
that
he
spent
30
days
in
the
hole
because
he
did
not
come
forth
there.
he
might
even
have
increased
regret
if
despite
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution,
no
criminal
prosecution
is
ever
brought
to
bear
on
him.
but
i
do
not
think
that
his
personal
problems
he
faces
are
the
same
as
a
constitutional
punishment,
if
you
will,
by
having
his
--
by
being
compelled
to
speak
and
being
in
a
compulsory
situation
in
that
regard
and
i
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
fact
of
life
is
that
despite
repeated
admonitions
from
the
court,
if
you
do
not
put
your
client
on
the
stand,
you
are
in
a
lot
trouble.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes,
but
i
do
not
think
we
should
--
they
are
no
different
of
course,
however,
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
think
what
we
have
to
deal
with
of
course
is
building
our
record
for
standing
in
front
of
an
appellate
court
someday,
but
the
point
is
that
i
think
what
is
ultimately
of
concern
is
the
inmates
will
on
his
volition
and
the
factor
in
the
decision
of
wolff
that
now
the
disciplinary
board
will
have
to
set
forth
reasons
for
the
decisions.
so
despite
the
frailties
of
human
nature
they
will
at
least
have
to
consider
what
the
guard
said
or
what
other
inmate
said.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
object
to
that,
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
of
course
the
civil
defendant
can
always
summoned
to
the
stand
by
the
adverse
party.
is
your
honor
suggesting
--
is
your
honor
asking
what
should
a
judge
do
on
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
the
rhode
island
disciplinary
laws
do
not
--
the
so-called
morris
rules
do
not
address
themselves
to
that
question.
they
do
say
that
the
inmate
shall
be
summoned
before
the
board
and
then
the
inmate
shall
be
interrogated
and
they
use
that
specific
word
interrogated
at
the
hearing.
itself
they
set
in
to
nicholas
palmigiano,
well
nick,
what
do
you
want
to
say
here,
that
is
the
direct
quote
and
they
also
then
said
well
you
are
remaining
silent,
are
you
going
to
answer
any
questions
we
put
to
you?
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
with
one
addition,
then
i
would
agree
that
counsel
may
not
be
required
and
that
would
be
if
there
were
to
be
no
interrogation
of
the
inmate
because
dealing
in
the
closed
prison
society
you
can
tell
him
he
can
be
silent,
that
his
silence
will
not
be
held
against
him
and
you
can
still
get
into
interesting
colloquys
with
prison
officials,
either
immediately
outside
the
room
or
at
the
board
itself
in
an
effort
to,
you
know,
we
do
not
understand
the
behavior
this
time,
that
you
are
usually
so
cooperative
and
we
have
been
good
to
you
people,
giving
you
the
prison
newspaper
and
all
this
sort
of
thing
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
think
it
would
because
then
we
would
have
no
custodial
interrogation
although
the
threat
of
future
criminal
prosecution
may
still
hang
over
his
head.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes
and
i
would
correct
any
notion
i
might
have
conveyed.
i
am
not
saying
that
in
all
situations
the
inmate
may
not
wish
to
speak.
i
am
simply
saying
that
to
make
that
careful
distinction
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
forgo
his
privilege,
looking
toward
the
trial
and
exercise
his
due
process
right
to
speak
in
order
to
perhaps
to
protect
himself
from
going
to
the
hole
or
some
other
in-prison
punishment,
yes,
the
lawyer’s
counsel
would
be
necessary.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
well,
i
can
only
say
that
there
have
been
numerous
instances
of
acquittal
when
someone
has
not
taken
the
stand.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
but
at
least
it
shows
that
the
jury
upon
a
proper
admonition
can
keep
that
in
its
mind.
so
while
i
certainly
concede
human
frailty,
i
think
that
in
an
effort
to
support
the
value
of
non-compulsion,
historically
and
up
to
the
present
day
we
should
at
least
have
rules
that
try
to
circumscribe
the
situations
enough
so
that
a
compulsion
and
adverse
inferences
will
be
minimized
and
i
think
that
counsel's
presence
is
required
in
this
instance
to
do
that.
a
distinction
that
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
is
that
we
proceed
here
solely
or
seek
intrusion
of
counsel
with
our
attention
solely
riveted
on
the
trial
that
looms
and
its
threatened
somewhere
down
the
line.
and
we
do
not
have
the
same
concern
here
for
a
conditional
liberty
that
was
present,
say
in
gagnon
or
morrissey
v.
brewer
and
because
we
are
in
the
miranda-mathis
situation,
we
contend,
we
are
entitled
to
the
counsel
because
of
the
custodial
interrogation.
and
so
our
focus
is
on
the
future
criminal
trial
and
not
so
much
on
getting
intruding
counsel
in
here
to
address
himself
to
the
issue
so
that
the
defendant
or
the
accused
prisoner
will
not
end
up
in
the
hole.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
would
add
though
it
is
admonitions
that
you
are
now
the
subject
of
a
criminal
prosecution
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
one
can
only
speculate
and
hope
that
based
upon
their
training,
they
will
recognize
a
crime
when
they
see
it.
the
fact,
i
think
that
we
can
--
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
i
think
the
burden
there
your
honor
is
clearly
on
the
state
that
when
it
brings
someone
into
a
custodial
situation
as
we
contend
this
is,
that
they
have
a
burden
of
advising
him
that
there
is
a
threat
in
criminal
prosecution.
the
morris
rules
so
provide,
recognizing
that
they
do
not
cover
every
eventuality.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
no,
on
that
set
of
facts
they
could
do
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes
they
could.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
yes,
i
cannot
to
concede
that
we
should
allow
prison
officials
in
this
position
to
bring
someone
in
on
your
set
of
admonitions
or
statements,
unless
it
possibly
self
incriminatory
statements.
mr.
stephen
j.
fortunato,
jr.
there
is
no
problem
and
if
that
had
happen
in
palmigiano,
we
probably
would
not
the
here
today.
what
we
are
saying
that
the
evil
of
the
palmigiano
situation
is
the
circumstances
of
the
interrogation
and
the
fact
that
he
was
advised
silence
would
be
held
against
him,
that
interrogation
was
in
fact
