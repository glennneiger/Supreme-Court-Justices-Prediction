justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
inmate
have
the
option
not
to
take
part
in
the
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
inmate
elects
not
to
remain
at
the
hearing
is,
does
that
result
in
any
sanction
or
punishment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
rule
was
changed
in
that
respect
following
the
first
circuit
decision?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
come
back
to
some
of
the
prior
questions,
the
answers
have
left
me
in
some
doubt
as
to
your
position.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
rules
require
that
the
inmate
be
advised
explicitly
that
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent.
not
say
anything
or
to
elect
not
to
answer
any
particular
question
and
moreover,
if
he
were
advised
that
his
silence
would
not
be
used
against
him,
would
you
still
think
that
the
presence
of
counsel
is
required
by
the
constitution?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
add
one
other
condition?
suppose
also
that
it
were
made
clear
that
the
inmate
may
leave
the
hearing
without
that
consequences.
let
us
get
back
to
the
first
statement
you
made
responding
to
your
opponent.
i
think
you
said
there
was
no
option
not
to
attend,
but
as
i
understood
what
the
attorney
general
said,
if
the
inmate
made
an
appearance
he
thereafter
could
leave.
now,
if
the
inmate
could
leave,
if
he
had
been
advised,
he
might
remain
silent,
could
leave
in
silence
and
departure
would
not
be
used
against
him,
would
that
answer
your
problem?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
you
say
you
voluntarily
give
the
miranda
warnings,
now
does
that
mean
you
also
provide
counsel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
what
in
effect
you
are
saying
is
you
give
fifth
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you
do
allow
attorneys
outside
of
the
hearing
room
for
the
purpose
of
advising
the
inmate
prior
to
the
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
turner
i
want
to
come
back
to
that
point
you
arrived
yet.
i
am
looking
at
the
question
number
one
in
your
brief
and
you
end
up
by
saying,
there
must
be
a
hearing
that
the
fact
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
of
inmate,
the
question
is
phrased
in
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
of
california,
states
that
specifically
in
terms
of
the
requirements
of
counsel
being
present,
can
you
beyond
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
exactly
do
you
say
it
requires
by
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
these
three
options
applied
only
where
the
misconduct
also
constitutes
a
crime?
