well,
the
(voice
overlap)
of
rhode
island
has
the
right
act,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
mean,
it
is
only
under
the
compulsion
of
the
first
circuit
seeking
this
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
understood
you,
you
said
that
they
now
make
provision
for
counseling
in
these
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
only
under
only
under
that
compulsion?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
this
something
like
the
assistance
that
a
lawyer
may
give
a
grand
jury,
what
--?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
would
have
a
lawyer
present
at
the
hearing
and
so?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
precisely
--
what
would
be
the
role
of
the
lawyer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mean,
simply
advises
his
client?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
a
lawyer
does
before
a
congressional
inquiry
for
example?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
say,
do
not
answer
this.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
this
role,
i
gather
you
think
no
law
--
non-lawyer
assistant
could
really
perform?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
if
he
cannot
retain
a
lawyer
one
must
be
appointed
for
him?
