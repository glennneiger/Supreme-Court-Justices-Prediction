justice
white
but
if
they
are
there
not
compelled
to
say
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
say
your
use
immunity
would
be
required
unless
he
is
compelled
to
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
this
function
that
you
are
talking
about
now
not
also
be
called
for
in
situations
where
there
is
no
other
crime
involved?
wolff
did
say
that
the
counsel
would
not
be
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
are
saying,
but
it
should
be
in
some
situations
such
as
when
the
conduct
is
independently
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
function
of
being
there
when
your
client
is
interrogated
would
seem
to
be
--
until
the
case
is
over
you
really
do
not
know
what
the
conduct
is
sometime.
so
you
would
like
to
be
there
whether
in
any
place,
at
any
time
that
your
client
is
interrogated?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
did
the
next
best
thing
and
said,
look,
i
will
tell
you
what
we
will
not
do,
we
will
not
ask
your
client
a
question.
he
wants
to
say
something
and
he
can
say
something,
but
we
are
just
not
going
to
ask
him
anything.
we
are
going
to
put
on
our
evidence,
if
he
is
got
anything
to
answer,
we
will
let
him
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
not
--
at
least
wolff
it
seems
to
me
said
that
you
do
not
need
counsel
present
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
were
some
in
there,
who
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
really
--
you
do
not
object
--
you
do
not
say
that
he
needs
to
be
advised
that
his
silence
would
be
use
against
him,
but
you
object
to
is
that
the
board
telling
him
that,
if
you
remain
quiet
that
will
be
used
against
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
is
really
compelled?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
get
in
the
lefkowitz
area
of
either
you
talk
or
we
will
fire
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
you
will
talk
or
i
will
convict
you
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
doing
voluntarily
everything
that
ninth
circuit
says
you
have
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
advise
him,
but
do
you
interrogate
him
if
he
does
not
--
do
you
start
to
take
--
to
interrogate
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
does
not
request
to
remain
silent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
an
interrogation
unless
he
claims
a
privilege?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
from
that
the
authority
used
at
the
hearing
to
advise
him
of
his
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
you
suppose
someone
would
understand
from
that,
that
they
are
advising
him
that
whatever
he
says
could
be
used
against
him,
not
only
for
purposes
of
the
disciplinary
hearing,
but
the
for
the
purposes
of
some
later
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
lefkowitz
if
he
did
not
talk,
he
would
his
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
for
being
silent?
justice
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
that
that
argument
would
seem
that
--
it
would
not
make
any
difference
in
what
is
this
conduct
is
otherwise
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
prejudice
him
during
this
disciplinary
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
say
that
the
(inaudible)
california
situation
that
the
man
may
at
any
time
decide
that
he
does
want
to
talk
or
talk
anymore
or
he
could
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
he
can
say
look,
i
do
not
want
to
talk
anymore,
i
have
now
said
all
i
want
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
may
stop
it
any
time,
do
you
think
he
can
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
it
probably
get
that
far.
suppose
the
question
is
(inaudible)
so
they
ask
him,
they
say,
well
and
simple
question
is
did
you
beat
up
the
guard
or
not?
now,
he
says,
well,
i
decline
to
answer
and
they
said,
fine,
is
there
any
other
--
do
you
want
to
answer
any
other
question,
he
says
no,
now
does
he
give
up
any
defense?
i
need
to
answer
that
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
he
does
not
give
up
any
defense
by
saying
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
the
way,
do
you
know
whether
there
are
any
claims
or
any,
there
is
no
law
that
says
if
you
lie
in
one
of
these
proceedings,
you
are
subject
to
perjury?
justice
byron
r.
white
baxter
case,
sir,
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
first
circuit
and
the
enomoto
case
is
here
from
the
ninth
circuit.
both
cases
involve
questions
of
constitutional
dimension
with
respect
to
disciplinary
proceedings
in
state
prisons
and
these
issues
in
turn
involve
questions
of
interpretation
application
of
our
decision
of
a
term
or
two
ago
in
wolf
against
mcdonald.
we
reverse
both
judgments.
the
reasons
are
given
in
the
opinion
which
we
have
filed
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
brennan
along
with
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
stevens
to
fill
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
cases.
