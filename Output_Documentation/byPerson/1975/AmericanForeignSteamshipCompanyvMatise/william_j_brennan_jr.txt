justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
do
not
prevail
on
your
submission
that
the
this
was
a
wages,
that
were
paid
when
he
got
the
airline
ticket.
has
there
been
any
doubt
that
he
would
be
liable
for
the
penalty
dated
from
the
day
when
the
wages
should
have
been
paid,
assuming
now
they
were
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
indicate
how
they
got
--
how
it
was
that
they
were
present?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
coast
guard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
were
right
about
that,
assuming
you
had
some
penalty
to
pay,
how
much
would
the
penalty
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
against
35?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
first
position
is
that
he
was
paid
full
wages
and
therefore
there
is
penalty
involved
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you
are
wrong
about
that
--
your
second
argument
is
that
in
any
event
you
have
a
good
faith
defense
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
