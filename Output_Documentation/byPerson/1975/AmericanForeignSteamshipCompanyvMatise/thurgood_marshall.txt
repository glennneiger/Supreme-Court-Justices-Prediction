74-966,
american
foreign
steamship
company
versus
matise.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
granville
matise,
a
seaman,
was
discharged
from
petitionerâ€™s
ship
while
it
was
docked
in
south
vietnam.
south
vietnamese
currency
regulation
precluded
petitioner
from
paying
this
seaman
the
wages
that
were
due
him
in
american
currency.
however,
airline
tickets
to
the
united
states
could
be
purchased
in
saigon
only
with
the
america
currency.
in
order
to
resolve
the
dilemma
created
by
the
situation,
petitioner
purchased
an
airline
ticket
to
the
united
states
for
the
seaman,
gave
him
the
ticket
together
with
a
wage
voucher
for
$118,
which
represented
the
wages
due
him
less
than
$510,
the
cost
of
the
airline
ticket.
the
seaman
subsequently
filed
suit
against
petitioner
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
claimed
the
petitioner
owed
him
the
full
amount
of
the
money,
$510
of
wages.
under
46
united
states
code
596
petition
was
liable
to
him
for
the
$510
plus
two
days
for
every
pay
that
pays
without
the
payment
of
the
$510.
the
district
court
found
that
the
seaman
had
consented
to
the
purchase
of
the
ticket
with
this
money.
it
held
that
petitioner
had
not
refused
or
neglected
to
make
the
wage
payment
and
hence
was
not
liable.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
section
596
requires
that
wages
payments
be
made
directly
to
the
seaman.
therefore,
the
$500
paid
to
the
airline
did
not
be
regarded
as
a
payment
of
wages.
on
remand,
the
district
court
assessed
damages
amounting
to
$596
and
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
an
appeal
from
this
assessment
and
we
granted
certiorari.
on
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
today,
we
revere
this
judgment.
the
district
court
explicitly
found
that
the
seaman
consented
to
the
application
of
the
money
that
was
due
him
through
the
purchase
of
the
airline
ticket.
moreover,
the
seaman
received
a
direct
benefit
in
the
form
of
the
ticket
from
the
expenditure
of
the
$500
that
he
could
to
have
received
through
being
paid
in
cash.
under
such
circumstances
we
hold
that
the
transaction
involving
the
purchase
of
receipt
of
airline
ticket
constituted
a
partial
payment
of
the
wages
and
that
section
596
should
not
be
read
to
preclude
such
payments,
and
that
there
was,
therefore,
no
neglect
or
refusal
to
make
payments
of
the
wages
in
this
case.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
