is
that
allotted?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
a
hundred
and
--
unknown
speaker
i
think
in
your
arguments
you
could
prevail
without
reference
to
arguelles,
can
you
not?
unknown
speaker
section
600,
just
read
it
again.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
advance,
the
advances
routine,
(inaudible),
would
you
agree
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
will
you
point
out
to
me
mr.
schmidt,
where
is
it
that
it
says
that
an
advance
is
to
be
treated
as
an
advance
only
if
the
seaman
signs
the
logbook
that
you
have
mentioned,
is
that
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
where
does
that
come
from?
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
if
a
seaman
came
to
the
ship's
captain
and
said
that
i
want
to
go
ashore,
i
need
--
i
want
to
buy
some
things,
but
i
am
broke,
would
you
give
me
a
hundred
dollars?
the
captain
gives
him
a
hundred
dollars
and
puts
it
down
as
advance,
but
does
not
get
the
seaman
to
sign
the
logbook.
i
gather
in
that
situation
the
seaman
would
still
be
owed
a
hundred
dollars,
is
that
right?
he
would
not
have
had
an
advance
of
wages.
unknown
speaker
no,
no
record.
just
forget
it.
he
goes
to
the
safe
and
he
gives
the
seaman
a
hundred
dollars,
and
they
do
not
take
out
the
logbook,
and
go
through
the
formality
that
you
suggested
has
to
be
completed
before
there
is
an
advance?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
lack
of
rule.
you
cannot
hold
the
seaman
as
having
received
wages
unless
he
has
signed
the
logbook
stating
that
he
has
received
wages?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
well,
i
have
you
interrupted.
i
gather
there
is
a
second
question
here
and
that
is
assuming
now
that
the
payment
for
the
airline
ticket
was
not
wages,
nevertheless,
under
the
statute
that
is
under
596,
the
shipowner
has
a
defense
if
the
refusal
or
neglect
to
make
payment
of
the
$510.00
as
wages
was
without
sufficient
cause,
right?
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
now,
what
interpretation
do
you
give
without
sufficient
cause?
only
those
things
which
are,
by
statute,
expressly
permitted
as
deductions?
unknown
speaker
how
far
would
you
go
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt,
i
do
not
think
i
heard
you
say
what
it
is
without
sufficient
cause,
includes
as
a
defense
to
the
shipowner
beyond
deductions
explicitly
authorized
by
these
statutes?
unknown
speaker
that
is
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
can
the
shipowner
legally
make
an
advance
before
wages
are
earned?
unknown
speaker
i
though
mr.
schmidt
said,
he
may
if
--
can
actually
the
--
seaman
signs
the
logbook?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
statute.
there
is
a
section
which
indicates
it
is
a
crime
to
make
payment
of
wages
before
they
are
earned?
unknown
speaker
and
he
found
the
second
one,
did
he
not,
when
(inaudible)
