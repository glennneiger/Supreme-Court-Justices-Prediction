justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
it
is
conceited
that
the
sailor
or
seaman
owed
to
the
shipowner
for
the
airline
ticket?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
ship
was
obligated
to
get
him
out
of
vietnam
under
the
law,
nevertheless,
that
did
not
mean
that
they
had
to
pay
his
way
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
can
get
him
out
of
vietnam,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
have
to
get
him
out
of
their
own
expense.
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
the
seaman’s
obligation,
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
court
of
appeals
--
it
did
not
seem
to
make
any
difference
to
the
court
of
appeals
whether
it
was
his
obligation
or
not,
whether
it
was
or
whether
it
was
not,
this
penalty
was
to
be
invoked?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
seaman
had
gone
with
them
to
the
airline
office
then
they
had
given
him
the
cash,
the
seaman
the
cash
and
said
this
is
part
of
your
wages
and
the
seaman
had
bought
his
own
ticket,
there
would
not
have
been
any
problem,
i
guess
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
might
have
violated
vietnam
law,
giving
him
the
cash
having
the
currency
there,
but
nevertheless
there
would
not
have
been
any
problem.
the
real
problem
is
paying
a
third
party
what
the
lawyer
claims
to
be
what
the
seaman
owed
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
that
it
was
determined
after
studying
whatever
laws
or
treaties
there
are
that
it
really
was
the
shipowner's
duty
and
also
his
financial
obligation
to
return
him
to
the
united
states,
that
it
was
to
be
on
his
pocket,
not
the
seaman’s
and
they
just
made
a
mistake,
you
have
just
been
wrong.
you
would
still
say
that
was
a
good
faith
defense,
i
understand
from
your
answer
to
justice
brennan
as
far
as
the
penalty
was
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so,
but
what
about
the
penalty
up
to
that
time?
assuming
you
were
wrong,
assume
you
are
wrong
that
it
was
really
the
shipowner's
cost
to
send
him
home,
assuming
you
were
wrong,
how
about
the
penalty
up
to
the
date
of
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
in
the
understanding
that
you
were
paying
him,
that
you
had
paid
him,
and
you
were
advised
that
you
would
--
that
you
have
paid
him,
and
that
it
was
his
cost,
not
yours?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
we
are
entitled
to
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
or
accept
the
finding
that
it
was
the
seaman’s
obligation
to
pay
air
fare
home?
is
it
--
we
--
you
say
we
--
it
is
perfectly
all
right
to
proceed
on
that
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
so
we
may
proceed
on
that
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
require
a
contract
it
or
not
that
section
does
not
answer
the
question
where
the
wage
is
paid
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)the
issue
is
was
the
wages
paid
--
were
the
wages
paid
by
buying
an
airline
ticket,
that
is
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
employer
pays
in
advance
to
the
seaman
cash?
are
not
the
seaman
comes
to
him
and
says,
i
want
a
little
prior
payment
on,
i
had
a
bad
luck
at
the
table
and
i
need
a
little,
i
need
a
hundred
dollars
and
employer
gives
it
to
him
in
cash?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
when
they
finally
pay
him
off
in
san
francisco,
they
will
deduct
that
advance?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
advance
is
quite
alright,
you
say,
but
an
advance
to
buy
an
airline
ticket
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
way
to
do
it.
now,
if
they
entered
that
in
the
logbook
in
this
case,
we
would
not
be
here?
if
they
had
entered
this
$500.00
in
the
logbook
as
an
advance
to
the
seaman,
he
would
not
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
seaman
later
says,
here
i
got
the
hundred
dollars,
but
you
owe
it
to
me
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
can
--
if
the
seaman
signs
on
and
he
goes
to
the
captain
and
says,
i
need
some
money,
i
am
just
broke,
i
know
i
have
not
earned
them
yet,
and
he
says
all
right
i
will
give
you
$200.00.
he
has
committed
a
crime
and
then
when
the
seaman
earns
the
money
and
the
shipowner
is
going
to
pay
him
off
and
he
purports
to
deduct
the
$200.00,
the
seaman
can
say.
well,
i
know
you
gave
me
the
two
hundred,
but
you
have
to
pay
me
again
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
says
just
in
plain
language
that
he
still
got
to
pay
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
says
these
advances
shall
be
no
defense
to
a
liable
suit
or
an
action
for
the
recovery
of
the
wages?
