mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
imposition
against
the
shipowner
of
penalties
in
excess
of
$35,000.00
and
this
amount
fine
due
is
in
addition
to
an
award
in
favor
of
a
seaman
or
the
seaman’s
estate
of
the
sum
of
$510.00
plus
interest,
which
amount
had
been
brought
by
the
shipowner
found
by
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
to
have
been
an
amount
which
was
in
fact
paid
to
the
seaman
as
part
of
the
shipowners’
obligation
to
pay
his
wages
in
full.
throughout
the
handling
of
the
case
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
of
the
law
on
the
subject
as
the
shipowner,
the
money
was
paid
in
vietnam
under
circumstances
where
u.s.
dollar
currency
by
the
local
law
was
not
permitted
to
go
into
circulation.
i
assume
the
reason
was
simply
that
there
was
a
great
disparity
between
the
black
market
rate
and
the
official
rate.
the
seaman
was
discharged
for
a
cause.
there
is
simply
is
no
question
about
that.
that
has
been
conceded
throughout
the
case.
it
would
also
has
been
held
even
by
the
court
of
appeals,
whose
opinion
imposed
this
penalty
that
the
cost
of
repatriation
following
a
discharge
for
cause
was
as
between
the
shipowner
and
the
seaman,
the
obligation
of
the
seaman.
we
thus
have
a
situation
which
quite
literally
is
one
in
which
a
penalty
of
$35,000.00
has
been
imposed,
and
if
we
apply
the
maximum
of
the
law
that
will
assume
to
have
been
done
which
should
have
been
done,
where
if
everything
had
been
followed
literally,
even
in
accordant
with
the
plaintiff’s
desire
and
wish,
the
$510
representing
the
cost
of
buying
air
transportation
back
to
this
country
would
immediately
on
the
seaman’s
return
to
this
country
and
the
payment
of
the
remainder
of
his
wages
have
been
returned
by
the
seaman
to
the
shipowner.
so
one
has,
may
i
say
either
absurd
or
outrageous
depending
upon
the
point
of
view,
a
situation
in
which
we
have
a
penalty
in
excess
of
$35,000.00
imposed
for
the
theoretical
deprivation,
taking
the
plaintiffs’
case
at
its
best.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
this
is
further
as
the
counsel
concedes
or
not,
i
do
not
know,
he
did
concede
it
in
the
district
court.
in
the
court
of
appeals
there
was
a
holding
that
the
cost
of
repatriation
was
the
seaman’s
obligation,
not
the
shipowners’.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
may
i
say
this
is
true,
but
before
i
say
it
is
true,
may
i
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
vietnam
treaties
and
obligations
of
the
shipowner
to
bring
him
home.
there
was
nothing
in
the
district
court
record
to
that
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
the
--
the
money
was
the
seaman’s
obligation,
that
went
further
and
i
had
some
discussion
about
vietnam
treaties
and
the
shipowner’s
obligation
to
put
to
their
sole
support
for
the
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
if
one
assumes
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
if
one
would
assume
that
there
was
a
treaty
obligation,
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
this
is
exactly
the
shipowners’
position,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
well,
may
i
--
the
--
i
have
spent
many
hours
attempting
to
understand
the
court
of
appeals'
first
opinion.
i
believe
in
good
conscience
and
the
best
of
my
study
can
come
forward
with,
that
the
explanation
lies
in
a
misreading
of
this
courts’
opinion
and
isbrandtsen
versus
johnson.
and
i
assume
that
the
court
has
some
familiarity
with
that.
that
is
a
case
in
which
the
shipowner
offset
or
attempted
to
offset,
against
the
seaman’s’
wages,
the
cost
of
deviating
the
ship
to
provide
medical
treatment
to
a
seaman
who
had
been,
without
justification
stabbed
by
the
seaman
plaintiff
who
was
suing
for
his
wages
and
penalty
wages.
the
holding
in
johnson
versus
isbrandtsen
in
its
express
terms
and
i
quote
is
that
the,
well,
there
are
few
three
dots,
if
you
will,
before
that
that
the
shipowner
so
far
and
here
is
the
quote,
“deductions
for
derelictions
in
the
performance
of
duty”
is
limited
to
the
specific
fines
and
penalties
that
are
provided
in
section
701
or
a
few
other
miscellaneous
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
heart
and
the
basis
of
the
misunderstanding
i
think
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
some
of
the
trouble
in
the
other
circuits
relates
to
the
extrapolation
of
the
carrying
beyond
the
holding
of
this
court
which
related
to
penalties
into
the
subject
which
we
have
here,
where
there
is
in
fact
an
attempt
with,
again,
some
of
the
seaman
with
all
sorts
of
official
watch
dogging,
if
you
will,
of
a
payment
in
kind
of
an
attempt
to
actually
make
the
full
payment
to
the
seaman.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
there
should
not
have
been.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
i
think
there
is
no
question
under
the
record
that
we
have
in
this
case
that
the
seaman
in
fact
did
go
to
the
airline
office,
accompanied
by
the
agent.
the
money
was
paid
to
the
airline,
he
got
the
ticket.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
this
could
be
and
here
we
have
the
fines
or
problem
that
the
shipowner
faces,
that
if
had
given
the
cash
to
the
seaman
one
second
before
he
gave
it
to
the
agent,
theoretically
they
are
on
that
side,
you
have
a
technical
violation.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
assuming
that
this
did
not
constitute
legal
payment
then
we
will
come
to
the
question
of
the
quantum
of
the
penalty,
is
that
correct
your
honor?
i
think
there
is
a
very,
very
serious
question
and
here
we
have,
i
do
not
intend
this
as
a
digression,
but
this
brings,
i
think
into
play,
the
entire
subject
of
this
group
of
statutes,
and
how
they
are
being
handled
and
what
is
to
be
done
in
fairness
on
both
sides.
the
enforcement
section
of
more
than
100
sections
of
title
46
which
are
designed
for
protecting
seamen
and
particularly
in
their
wage
relationships.
the
enforcement
section
is
the
section
596,
which
is
directly
before
the
court,
and
which
as
the
court
is
aware,
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
penalty
of
two
days
pay
for
each
day
that
goes
by
where
the
master
or
owner
who
refuses
or
neglects
to
make
payment
without
sufficient
cause.
it
has
been
held
by
this
court,
so
far
as
i
am
aware
consistently
in
the
opinions
to
this
court
since
pacific
mail
steamship
versus
schmidt,
that
without
sufficient
cause
language
embodies,
should
be
read
as
including
within
the
statute
a
rule
of
reasons
so
that
if
the
shipowner
is
acting
reasonably
at
any
stage
of
the
process
in
which
payment
is
not
made,
the
penalty
is
not
triggered
and
this
is
true,
even
though
there
may
be
a
legal,
a
technical-legal
failure
on
the
shipowners’
part
in
having
either
made
payment
in
the
wrong
manner
and
the
wrong
medium,
or
having
made
an
improper
deduction.
here
in
the
schmidt
case,
it
was
held
by
this
court,
that
the
shipowner
had
a
valid,
let
us
say
by
valid,
i
mean
a
colorable,
an
arguable,
a
good
faith
argument
from
appealing
from
the
district
court
opinion
and
during
the
course
of
the
appeal,
this
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
which
had
imposed
the
penalty
during
the
course
of
appeal,
saying
in
effect
that
the
shipowner
was
entitled
to
pursue
his
rights.
that
is
to
inquire
out
--
to
inquire
whether
he
was
right
at
any
event.
in
this
case,
we
have
an
even,
may
we
say,
in
my
view
of
it,
the
strongest
possible
situation
where
we
not
only
thought
in
good
faith
that
we
had
made
payment,
we
complied
with
the
requirements
of
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
which
has
set
up
a
very,
may
i
say,
extensive
infrastructure
of
bureaucracy,
in
the
good
sense
of
the
word,
to
enforce
the
seaman’s’
rights.
these
were
complied
within
vietnam.
the
vice
consul
was
present
and
members
of
the
coast
guard.
the
court
of
appeals
with,
may
i
say,
no
reason
and
no
justification
of
the
record,
stated
that
the
presence
of
the
united
states
vice
consul
and
the
coast
guard
officers,
that
they
were
not
acting
within
their
official
capacity.
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
record
and
no
justification
for
that.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
the
record
does
not
indicate
who
called
whom,
but
that
record
does
indicate
that
the
vice
consul
was
inquiring
into
the
circumstances
of
the
discharge
into
the
loggings,
that
he
performed
all
the
duties
which
the
statute
requires
him
to
perform,
including
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
discharge
to
the
seaman,
reassuring
that
he
had
received
a
wage
voucher.
the
participation
and
the
termination
of
the
seaman
wanted
to
be
repaid
by
air
and
consented
to
this
procedure
and
might
as
--
what
occurs
to
me
as
the
only
possible
explanation
is
that
in
this
mass
of
statutes
and
there
are
more
than
a
hundred
sections
and
detailed
regulations,
it
simply
may
have
well
escaped
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
procedure
was
one
that
was
called
for
by
a
statute
and
that
the
vice
consul
was
not
simply
acting
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
the
coast
guard,
i
suspect,
and
the
record
does
not
disclose
except
that
they
all
came.
as
far
as
i
am
aware
the
coast
guard
was
in
attendance
presumably
at
the
request
of
the
vice
consul
because
presumably
the
coast
guard
officers
that
had
some
experience
in
the
shipping
commissioner
capacity
and
had
greater
familiarity
with
the
signing
on
and
off
of
seamen.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
i
did
not,
i
believe,
give
adequate
or
a
proper
answer.
what
i
think
is
a
very
strong
and
outstanding
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
we
not
only
went
through
all
of
those
procedures.
there
was
a
trial
in
the
district
court
in
which
the
district
court
found
that
we
had
in
fact
made
payment.
so
we
would
think
that
the
shipowner
so
far
as
the
question
of
sufficient
cause
is
concerned
or
a
rule
of
reason
or
an
entitlement
to
assume,
if
you
will,
among
other
things
should
have
been,
at
least
so
far
as
the
calculation
of
the
quantum
of
the
penalty
is
concerned,
entitled
to,
may
i
say,
rely
on
the,
after
a
full
contest,
it
was
no-default
procedure,
decision
of
the
district
court
after
a
trial
that
payment
had
been
made
and
certainly
in
the
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
i
would
think
that
up
to
date
of
the
trial
in
a
case
where
the
district
--
i
think
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
and
so
far
as
the
calculation
of
a
period
of
time
is
concerned,
i
would
think
that
certainly
through
the
decision,
through
the
two
decisions
of
the
trial
court
of
course,
the
first
one
found
that
we
had
paid,
i
would
say
that
through
that
one,
we
are
affirmed
in
the
sufficiency
of
our
cause
and
persisting
in
our,
we
are
assuming,
a
wrongful
belief,
and
i
would
say
that,
certainly,
in
applying
the
rule
of
reason
that
the
courts
have
applied,
and
i
would
say
that
this
court
applied
in
the
smith
case,
we
were
entitled
to
persist
in
this
assumed,
erroneous
course,
certainly
up
to
the
time
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
would
suggest
up
to
the
time
of
the
second
judgment
of
the
trial
court
which
was
entered
in
response
to
the
mandate
and
injunction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
based
not
only
on
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
but
on
the
intervening
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
by
a
different
panel
in
escobar
saying.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
i
am
sorry
sir.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
the
penalty
calculates
at
the
rate
of
approximately
$29.00
per
day
and
presumably
would
--
the
--
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
have
at
the
moment
the
date
of
entry
of
the
trial
court
judgment.
i
would
say
that
would
have
been
last
june,
it
would
be
approximately
$8,000.00,
i
would
think,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
may
i
--
on
the
subject
of
discharge
and
this
mass
of
statutes
that
i
was
touching
upon,
although
the
amount
here
was
$510.00,
under
the
statute
that
of
course
would
be
triggered
by
any
failure
to
pay
if
it
were
willful,
even
though
it
were
a
matter
of
just
a
few
cents.and
among
the
mass
of
statutes
and
the
question
of
airline
versus
other
repatriation,
there
is
a
statute,
46
u.s.c.
section
683
and
this
must
be
the
one
that
the
counsel
and
the
coast
guard
were
directing
their
attention
to,
even
though
the
master
had
not.
that
the
master,
in
case
of
a
discharge
abroad
shall
provide
any
seaman
so
discharged
with
employment
on
a
vessel
agreed
to
by
the
seaman,
or
shall
provide
him
with
one
months’
extra
wages,
if
it
shall
be
shown
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
counsel,
that
such
seaman
was
not
discharged
for
neglect
of
duty,
incompetence,
or
injury
incurred
in
the
vessel.
this
is
not
our
case.
he
was
discharged
for
misconduct
and
there
is
no
question
on
that
when
that
is
conceded
for
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
and
this
statutory
provision
that
i
just
adverted
to,
i
think
points
out
the
absurdity
of
the
result
because
of
the
shipowner,
in
this
case,
as
it
did
not,
had
discharged
the
seaman
wholly
without
cause,
the
shipowner's
obligation
would
have
been
to
pay
one
months’
wages
or
to
find
him
a
work-away
job
on
another
ship.
there
is
no
requirement
for
air
transportation
home
so
far
as
the
statutes
are
concerned.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
that
is,
i
believe
the
statute
is
46,
section
670.
it
requires
the
ship
to
maintain
a
slop
chest.
it
says
the
seaman
can
buy
from
it
and
the
reason
i
am
delighted
of
the
question
is
that
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
sales
on
credit.
that
is
for
deducting
from
the
seaman’s
wages,
the
amount
of
slop
chest
purchases.
although
incidentally
the
form
has
--
although
it
has
american
form
esteem
on
it,
essentially
follows
the
forms
of
the
coast
guard
use
for
and
it
is
a
traditional
type
of
form,
they
always
have
had
prevision
for
advances
for
slop
chest
and
this
was
another
one
of
those
where
the
money
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
seamen
and
has
traditionally
been
done
and
never
has
been
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
this
is
the
case
in
connection
with
the
slop
chest.
now,
what
--
following
today,
i
do
not
know,
he
may
have
a
mass
of
slop
chest,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
allotments
are
specific
or
statutory
and
that
is
so
specific
in
the
statute
that
i
would
make
no
argument
based
on
an
allotment
that
was
not
justified
by
the
statute.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
the
fines
are
also
specific
and
fines,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
are
exactly
what
was
determined
by
this
court
in
u.s.
versus
johnson.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
instance,
either
in
the
courts
or
other
wise,
in
which
since
u.s.
versus
johnson,
there
has
been
a
penalty
type
of
withholding.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
it
is
isbrandtsen
versus
johnson,
yes.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
in
the
isbrandtsen
case,
your
honor?
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
they
were
no
fines.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
oh,
no,
no,
i
am
sorry.
the
fines
are
not
in
controversy
for
this
case.
those
were
in
connection
with
the
repeated
episodes
of
misconduct
in
connection
with
which
he
was
finally
discharged.
and
there
is
no
controversy
concerning
the
fines
in
this
case.
it
is
only
the
510.
to
conclude
very
briefly,
essentially,
i
believe
where
we
now
are
is
a
result
of
a
misreading
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
some
of
the
other
courts
of
isbrandtsen
versus
johnson
as
reading
it
as
going
beyond
the
deductions
in
the
nature
of
penalty.
we
also
have,
perhaps
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
but
if
i
may
touch
on
it,
the
statutory
scheme
which
is
very
complex,
which
obviously
has
caused
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
some
difficulty,
perhaps
compounded
by
the
accident
in
the
ninth
circuit
of
published
opinions,
of
which
this
is
one,
unpublished
opinions
by
other
panels
dealing
with
exactly
the
same
subject
matter,
reaching
opposite
results
and
which
we
apparently
under
in
terrorem
injunctions
of
rules
of
the
court
are
not
permitted
to
use
as
precedent
or
authority.
so
we
have
some
difficulty
in
telling
what
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit
is,
but
we
do
have
the
situation
in
this
court
that
represent,
sorry
in
this
case,
which
represents
the
difficulty
that
it
had
in
dealing
with
the
complex
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme
and
one
is
left
with
the
thought,
although
it
may
never
surface
simply
because
of
the
difficulty
of
another
case
in
which
it
will
be
presented
of
this
court,
perhaps
taking
another
look
at
its
decision
in
u.s.
bulk
carriers
versus
arguelles,
in
400
u.s.351,
which
dealt
with
the
subject
of
arbitration
of
this
type
of
thing
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
yes,
this
is
a
total
digression
your
honor.
may
i
reserve
5
minutes?
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
am
at
--
simply
on
a
couple
of
technical
things
that
may
possibly
cause
a
little
confusion.
there
was
considerable
discussion
on
exploration
of
the
subject
of
advances
and
logging
and
how
one
handles
advances
and
all
in
the
general
context
of
the
complex
problems
that
one
has
when
one
pays
a
seaman.
we
have
on
pages
4
and
5
of
the
appendix
a
reproduction
of
the
pay
voucher.
now,
this
is
the
document
which
was
worked
up,
which
was
under
consideration
by
the
vice-consul,
the
two
coast
guard
people,
mr.
matise,
and
the
master
in
vietnam.
the
technical
thing
that
i
wish
to
mention
for
the
possible
assistance
of
the
court
is
that
the
statutory
routine
for
the
recording
and
the
making
of
advances
against
wages
which
counsel
--
to
which
counsel
adverted
relates
to
advances
against
earned
wages
made
during
that
time
that
the
seaman
is
a
member
of
the
crew.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
no,
no.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
there
may
--
i
first
--
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
cannot
be
made
before
they
are
earned.
the
word
advance
means
advance
against
earned
wages.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
well,
the
slop
chest
is,
i
think
there
is
no
statutory
authority
whatsoever
for
the
advancing
of
credit
on
that.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
that
is
correct
and
it
requires
that
sales
be
made
to
the
seaman
from
the
slop
chest
that
can
just
as
well
be
read
as
cash
sales.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
this
is
--
this
one
--
it
usually
is
extended.
[laughter]
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
exactly.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
i
certainly
assume
so,
yes,
and
counsel
certainly
presses
the
point.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
this
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
this
is
my
understanding.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
in
the
sense
that
the
deduction
for
those
unlawful
advances
is,
since
all
shipowners
understand
this
by
this
time,
you
would
have
a
serious
problem
in
presenting
a
good
faith
defense
on
that
particular
one
and
then
you
would
have
penalties.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
yes
and
that
is
pretty
clear
so
then
one
comes
into
596
and
one
would
have
a
very
difficult
situation
in
presenting
it.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
no,
no.
this
is
exactly
the
point
i
wish
to
mention
to
the
court.
the
wage
advances
that
counsel
was
mentioning
were
those
to
a
member,
to
person
that
is
still
a
member
of
the
crew.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
had
been
discharged,
was
no
longer
on
the
crew,
he
no
longer
was
a
party
to
the
articles
or
to
the
--
he
no
longer
was
a
working
member
to
whom
the
official
log
would
be
a
normal
working
document.
he
had
been
discharged
and
that
is
set
forth
in
this
document,
which
is
four
and
five,
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
whether
he
was
paid
the
wages
that
he
was
entitled
to
following
discharge.
may
i
suggest
that
his
signature
on
this
form
which
is
a
wage
voucher
that
the
counsel
is
required
to
administer
is
certainly
as
far
as
anybody
could
have
gone
to
accomplish
the
equivalent
of
the
signature
in
the
logbook.
mr.
francis
l.
tetreault
and
the
second
one,
may
i
point
out
is
done
before
the
shipping
commissioner
here,
signed
by
the
shipping
commissioner,
signed
by
the
man
himself
and
is
the
government
form
which
is
the
mutual
lease
which
a
statute
requires
to
be
signed
before
wages
are
paid.
unless
there
are
further
questions.
