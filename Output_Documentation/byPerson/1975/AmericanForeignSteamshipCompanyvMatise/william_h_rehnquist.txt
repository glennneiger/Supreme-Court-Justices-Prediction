justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
not
the
payment
for
the
air
fare
made
in
saigon
treatable
as
a
partial
payment
of
wages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tetreault,
if
you
take
a
look
at
page
5
of
the
tan
appendix,
where
there
is
the
statement
apparently
furnished
by
your
client
to
the
respondent
of
deductions
and
look
down
the
lower
half
of
the
page
where
it
says
first
and
half
deductions
transportation
saigon
to
san
francisco,
$510.00
and
then
right
below
that
says
advances
such
and
such
then
beyond
that
it
says,
slop
chest,
$51.00.
now,
i
take
if
that
is
the
kind
of
a
canteen
that
the
man
goes
into
and
gets
cigarettes
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
authority?
is
there
a
statutory
authority
for
deducting
slop
chest
chits,
or
is
that
just
a
process
of
consent
by
the
seaman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
consent
is
enough
without
specific
statutory
authorization?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
is
isbrandtsen.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
you
referring
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
seaman
agrees
as
in
the
case
of
the
case
of
a
slop
chest
that
he
has
bought
so
much
and
agrees
to
have
it
deducted
consensually?
does
the
shipowner
still
have
to
sue
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statute
does
not
authorize
a
deduction
from
wages
for
the
slop
chest
purchases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
u.s.
code
citations
to
the
statute
that
you
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
does
not
say
it
does
not
seem
to
me
what
you
said
it
said.
that
certainly
does
not
say
that
the
seaman
may
never
consent
to
receive
his
wages
in
some
other
form
or
to
have
some
other
payment
made
such
as
was
made
in
this
case.
what
language
of
section
6,
under
what
particular
phrase
in
it
do
you
think
supports
your
contention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
talking
about
remedies
for
the
recovery
of
wages
not
to
the
substantive
question
of
whether
the
wages
are
due
and
owing
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
cases
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
a
district
court
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
first
sentence
of
section
599,
talking
about
advances
and
allotments
says,
would
give
the
impression
anyway
that
a
seaman
cannot
assign
wages
not
yet
earned.
it
looks
like
a
flat
prohibition,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
it
goes
out
and
says
he
can
a
lot
of,
but
the
allotment
would
take
effect
after
the
wage
has
been
earned,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
suppose
your
opponentsâ€™
contention
here
is
that
these
were
not
assignments
of
wages,
unearned
wages,
this
was
a
payoff
of
wages
that
had
in
fact
been
earned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
assert
any
due
process
claim
here,
do
you?
i
mean
the
due
process
provisions
apply
to
the
federal
government,
the
state
government,
the
local
government.
the
shipowner
is
not
a
part
of
the
united
states
or
part
of
any
state,
is
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
599
says
that?
599
certainly
as
i
read
it
makes
it
a
crime
to
advance
against
unearned
wages,
but
do
you
think
it
also
says
that
they
have
to
be
paid
again?
