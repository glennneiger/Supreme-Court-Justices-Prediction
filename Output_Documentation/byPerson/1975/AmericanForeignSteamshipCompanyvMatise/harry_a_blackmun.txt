harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
fines?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
were
the
fines
imposed
before,
do
you
know?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
you
distinguish
this
case
from
coley
and
mccray?
you
had
started
mentioning
these.
i
would
like
to
have
you
follow
through
on
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
what
the
facts
are.
i
am
just
curious
as
to
whether
there
is
an
element
of
impossibility
of
performance
here
also?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
not
there
an
impossibility
of
his
staying
in
the
foreign
port
here
due
to
local
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
not
true
that,
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
by
treaty
and
by
sovereign
vietnam
law,
was
not
there
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
owner
to
remove
all
persons
he
had
brought
to
south
vietnam?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
is
not
there
an
impossibility
of
performance
here
that
equates
with
coley
and
mccray
in
the
impossibilities
of
performance
there?
