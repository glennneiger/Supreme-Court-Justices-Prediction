mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
this
morning
challenges
two
of
the
most
important
and
basic
rights
belonging
to
the
american
seamen.
the
first
one
became
a
seaman’s
right
at
the
same
time
that
all
american
citizens
acquired
that
the
constitutional
right
to
due
process
before
being
deprived
of
his
property.
the
second
right
is
a
very
important
one
that
makes
enforcement
of
the
first
possible.
my
respected
opponent
has
just
referred
to
section
596
as
the
enforcement
section.
the
shipowner’s
position
in
these
proceeding
this
morning
attempts
to
render
useless
this
very
important
enforcement
section.
i
have
prepared
a
statement
to
explain
the
respondents’
position
here
and
i
do
not
want
to
take
up
a
point-by-point
refutation
or
discussion
of
the
statement
that
had
just
been
made
by
opposing
counsel.
however,
on
the
repatriation
point,
i
am
going
to
deal
with
that
first.
at
the
trial,
i
summarize
by
saying
there
has
been
error
carried
consistently
through
this
litigation
with
respect
to
the
repatriation
aspect,
the
contract
implied
on
the
part
of
the
seaman
to
repay
the
vessel.
at
the
trial,
the
court
spoke
to
the
seaman’s
counsel
and
said
the
proposed
findings
of
the
defendant
indicate
that
the
shipowner
had
no
obligation
to
bear
the
expense
of
the
plaintiffs’
return
to
the
united
states.
do
you
dispute
that?
counsel
replied,
i
dispute
it
emphatically
your
honor,
but
i
say
that
it
is
irrelevant.
it
is
not
at
issue
in
this
trial.
court:
al
right,
alright,
proceed.
in
the
court’s
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law,
the
trial
court’s
findings
at
length
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
they
appear
in
the
transcript
to
page
44,
line
12.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
no.
i
have
you
to
give
you
the
correct
page.
it
is
page
80
of
the
appendix,
two-thirds
of
the
weight
to
the
bottom
of
the
page.
from
the
evidence
it
is
undisputed
that
the
obligation
to
repatriate
the
plaintiff
was
not
upon
the
shipowner,
but
was
rather
the
personal
responsibility
of
the
seaman.
but
the
appellate
court
simply
accepted
that
and
because
even
down
to
today
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
obligation,
of
the
existence
of
any
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
seaman
to
reimburse
the
shipowner
is
not
actually
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
presented
by
this
proceeding
is
whether
or
not
the
statutory
rights,
given
to
a
seaman
by
congress
to
ensure
that
he
would
not
be
overreached
by
recoupments
and
repayments
asserted
unilaterally
by
his
employer.
his
employer
being
historically,
and
today,
in
a
position
to
produce
proofs
from
foreign
places
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
consular
officials,
his
own
agents
in
foreign
ports,
locally.
there
is
simply
no
fair
contest
between
a
nomad
who
worked
on
a
ship
for
a
while
and
the
corporation
that
owns
and
operates
those
ships.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
well,
your
honor,
i
want
to
say
that
i
consider
that
to
be
completely
erroneous,
but
that
this
court’s
decision
would
be
the
same
in
either
event.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
it
is
completely
erroneous,
and
i
say
that
without
resorting
to
(inaudible)
it
is
completely
erroneous
in
view
of
the
statutory
protections
which
congress
established
for
a
seaman
in
order
to
prevent
precisely
this
kind
of
a
finding
being
made
by
a
court.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
am
sorry.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
think
that
it
definitely
does.
i
think
that
the
law
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
seamen
cannot
contract
and
cannot
enter
into
any
kind
of
an
agreement,
that
would
diminish
their
rights
to
wages
at
the
time
that
they
are
paid
off
before
a
shipment
commissioner,
the
knowledge
on
the
part
of
shipowners
which
they
are
certainly
are
required
since
1872
down
to
the
present
time
to
have
acquired,
the
knowledge
that
they
cannot
repay
themselves
unilaterally
from
a
seaman’s
earned
wages
goes
right
to
the
good
faith
of
the
entire
transaction.
if
a
shipowner
claims
that
a
seaman
owes
it
money,
it
must
do
what
everyone
else
must
do
in
our
society
who
says
that
a
seaman
owes
it
money,
it
must
resort
to
a
judicial
process.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
no,
your
honor.
the
statutes
create
the
slop
chest
and
it
has
historically
been
the
procedure
for
a
seaman
who
purchases
something
from
the
slop
chest
to
sign
his
name
on
the
date
of
the
purchase
in
the
official
logbook.
the
logbooks
are
printed
by
the
government
and
they
carry
pages
labeled
for
the
specific
purpose
of
keeping
track
of
the
seaman’s
purchases
from
the
slop
chest.
so
on
the
day
that
he
purchases,
he
signs
his
name
or
initials
opposite
the
amount.
that
is
statutory.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
believe
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
say
that
a
statute
that
creates
a
slop
chest
limits
the
percentage
that
the
captain
can
charge
in
terms
of
profit,
specifies
sold
items
that
the
slop
chest
must
carry
under
penalty
or
fine.
when
the
logbook
carries
pages
devoted
to
keeping
that
record
that
certainly
comes
close
to
being
statutory.
it
is
a
formal
procedure
that
is
subject
to
close
scrutiny
and
it
requires
a
seaman’s
signature
in
exactly
the
same
manner
that
wage
advances
made
to
him
in
foreign
places
require
his
signature
in
the
official
logbook.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
absolutely,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
under
the
statutes
enacted
in
1872,
shipping
commissions
act
of
june
4,
1872,
a
seaman
cannot
agree.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
contracts
are
forbidden
by
section
600
of
title
46.
it
is
very
brief.
section
600;
no
seaman
shall
by
any
agreement,
other
than
as
provided
by
title
53
of
the
revised
statutes,
forfeit
his
lien
upon
the
ship
or
be
deprived
of
any
remedy
for
the
recovery
of
his
wages,
to
which
he
would
otherwise
have
been
entitled.
and
every
stipulation
in
any
agreement
inconsistent
with
any
provision
of
title
53
of
the
revised
statutes
and
every
stipulation
by
which
any
seaman
consents
to
abandon
his
right
to
his
wages
in
the
case
of
the
loss
to
ship,
or
to
abandon
any
right
which
he
may
have
or
obtained
in
the
nature
of
salvage
shall
be
holding
an
altitude.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
no
seaman
shall
by
any
agreement
other
than
as
provided
by
title
53
of
the
revised
statutes
forfeit
his
lien
upon
the
ship
or
be
deprived
of
any
remedy
for
the
recovery
of
his
wages
to
which
he
would
otherwise
have
been
entitled.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
but
your
honor
the
cases
have
--
i
can
cite
i
believe
selman
offhand,
the
cases
have
interpreted
this
language
to
me
that
a
seaman
cannot
contract.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
true.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court
to
note
section
644,
rules
for
settlement.
the
fourth
section
says,
in
cases
in
which
discharge
and
settlement
before
a
coast
guard
official
to
whom
the
duties
of
shipping
commissioner
had
been
delegated
are
required,
and
that
is
all
off-shore
trips,
including
this
one,
discharge
and
settlement
is
required
before
shipping
commissioner
or
the
coast
guard
official
performing
those
duties.
no
payment,
receipt,
settlement
or
discharge
otherwise
made
shall
operate
as
evidence
of
the
release
or
satisfaction
of
any
claim.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
think
nothing
--
to
answer
your
honor
there
were
two
coast
guards
hearing
officers,
not
hearing
officers,
investigating
officers
present
at
the
time
that
the
man
was
discharged
in
saigon.
there
was
no
disposal
made
of
his
wages
there.
the
shipowner
at
the
time
of
the
pay-off
in
san
francisco
said,
i
am
keeping
back
$510.00
of
the
wages
which
i
admit
you
earned
to
repay
myself
for
an
airline
ticket
that
was
bought
for
your
benefit.
and
the
cases
have
been
clear
from
jolly’s
for
example,
the
man
who
was
put
in
jail.
he
signed
an
agreement,
a
written
agreement
to
repay
from
his
wages
the
amounts
that
the
captain
let
him
have
in
order
to
buy
a
mattress,
to
buy
some
food,
and
to
procure
legal
help.
the
captain
knew
that
such
an
advance,
presumably
he
knew
it
was
illegal
because
he
put
down
the
sums
that
he
had
given
to
the
seaman
as
fines
and
the
court
held
that
this
was
not
a
deduction
permitted
by
a
statute
and
the
double-wage
penalty
was
applied.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
gonzalez
was
an
appellate
court
case,
i
believe.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
usual
situation
of
that
kind
would
involve
the
seaman
signing
an
entry
in
the
official
logbook
that
he
had
received
in
advance
of
his
wages.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
correct.
the
advances
show
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes,
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
that
an
advance
made
pursuant
to
section
597,
requiring
it
to
be
added
in
the
logbook
and
signed
by
the
seaman
is
a
statutory,
legal
and
enforceable
payment
of
wages.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
and
the
seaman
had
signed
it.
if
it
had
observed
the
procedures
for
paying
a
man
wages
in
advance
there
would
be
no
contest.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
pardon.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
law
permits
him
to
obligate
wages
for
allotments
to
be
sent
to
his
family,
for
slop
chest
purchases,
and
for
wages.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
well,
this
is
provided
for
by
statute.
he
cannot
enter
into
any
kind
of
an
agreement
with
the
shipowner
or
anyone
else
that
involves
his
wages.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes,
your
honor.
advances
are
provided
for
by
section
599,
advances
and
allotments.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
well,
this
is
the
number
given
by
the
amendment
i
think
of
1915,
the
seaman’s
bill?
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
revised
statute
number,
i
have
not
put
down
the
equivalents.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
600,
yes.
agreements
concerning
laws
apply
to
wages.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
believe
it
would
be
section
31.
i
am
looking
at
their
historical
note.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes,
alright.
and
every
stipulation
in
any
agreement
inconsistent
with
any
provision
of
title
53
of
the
revised
statutes.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
the
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
revised
statutes
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
statute
permits
certain
specified
deductions
from
wages
and
the
statute
that
permits
deductions
for
advances
is
section
599
and
i
could,
given
time
i
could
find
the
equivalent
of
it
in
the
revised
statutes
because
it
is
an
old
law.
it
is
there,
it
provided
that
a
seaman
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
well,
i
can
only
say
your
honor,
i
am
under
the
impression
that
the
seaman’s
bill
incorporated
a
great
amount
of
past
law
and
gave
it
--
gave
these
sections
new
numbers.
i
have
the
numbers
for
the
seaman’s
bill
enacted
in
1915.
i
know
that
the
right
to
pay
seaman
advances
existed
before
1915
because
prior
to
that
time
a
seaman
was
entitled
to
demand
one-third
of
his
earned
wages
and
the
--
the
lafollette
act
of
the
seaman’s
bill
changed
that
to
one-half.
so,
i
cannot
answer
your
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
with
the
respect
to
wage
advances
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
the
only
way
to
advance
money
to
the
seaman
under
the
law.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
599
does
completely
prohibit
the
payment
to
seamen
of
wages
in
advance
at
the
time
that
he
has
earned
them.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
correct.
so
that
is
a
statutory
provision
for
an
employer
to
pay
out
a
seaman’s
wages
after
they
have
been
earned,
but
in
advance
of
the
payoff
before
a
shipping
commissioner.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
for
what
its
worth
that
argument
can
properly
be
made
because
the
wages
had
been
earned
at
the
time
the
shipowner
spent
this
money.
the
man
did
not
earn
any
more
money
after
the
time
that
he
was
discharged.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
do
not
believe
that
specific
language
is
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
think
your
facts
included
the
captain
making
it
in
advance
and
making
a
record
out
as
an
advance.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct
and
the
historical
explanation
of
it
is
obvious.
it
is
very
easy
for
knowledgeable
people
like
masters
and
ship's
agents
and
paymasters
to
either
procure
a
seaman’s
genuine
consent
wrongfully
and
it
happens
in
daily
life,
where
consent
to
frauds
happens
regularly
and
seamen
are
notoriously
ill-equipped
to
deal
with
these
things.
on
the
other
hand,
consent
need
not
to
have
been
given
by
the
seaman
at
all.
he
can
have
been
exceedingly
angry
about
it
and
for
purposes
of
litigation,
he
is
lost
because
the
captain,
the
company
will
provide
affidavits
from
abroad,
they
will
provide
letters,
they
will
muster
witnesses,
ship’s
officers
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
relationship
with
the
company
and
a
seaman
attempting
to
prove
that
he
did
not
consent
to
a
wage
deduction,
does
not
have
much
of
a
chance.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
think
that
is
completely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
not
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
the
case
is
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
the
principle
point
here
this
morning.
the
statute
absolutely
forbids
a
shipowner
to
repay
itself
for
unilaterally
asserted
claims.
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
but
there
are
other
situations,
and
the
cases
described
for
example,
collie
against
fergusson,
where
the
shipowner
was
insolvent.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
believe
that
the
due
process
and
i
could
be
wrong
about
this,
i
believe
that
a
person
who
is
deprived
of
his
property
in
this
manner
can
properly
say
that
his
right
under
the
constitution
with
respect
to
due
process
have
been
invaded
and
ignored.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
well,
your
honor
that
is
not
true
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
court
has
been
deceived
on
this
particular
thing.
with
respect
to
repatriation,
there
has
been
an
assumption
throughout
that
there
is
a
duty
to
repatriate
the
seaman.
the
seaman
has
no
duty
to
be
repatriated
or
to
repatriate
himself,
he
does
not
in
most
cases
want
to
be
and
until
shipowners
introduced
the
practice
in
fairly
recent
times
of
always
bringing
men
home
whom
they
discharge
or
leave
abroad
whether
for
illness
or
for
cause,
shipowners
now
engage
in
the
practice
of
always
brining
these
seamen
home.
in
past
years
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
shipowner,
wherever
he
lands
a
person
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
the
shipowner
has
a
legal
duty
to
perform
it
and
he
is
doing
it
as
part
his
--
the
duties
owed
to
his
crew
members.
the
law
has
imposed
that
duty
for
a
long
time.
the
seaman
is
definitely
the
beneficiary
of
that,
but
when
a
shipowner
takes
back
to
the
united
states
a
seaman
who
is
left
abroad
he
is
performing
an
inescapable
duty
that
is
imposed
upon
him
by
that
local
government.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
right.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
if
he
takes
him
to
manila,
he
simply
creates
the
same
situation
again.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
that
is
correct.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
sufficient
cause
has
been
found
to
exist,
your
honor
by
the
court
in
situations
where
performance
of
payment
were
made
impossible.
collie
against
fergusson
was
the
first
of
those.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes.
sufficient
cause
has
been
found
to
exist
in
a
great
many
cases,
more
than
insolvency
where
it
has
been
determined
and
decided
by
the
court
that
there
was
a
good
faith
dispute
concerning
whether
or
not
the
wages
in
question
had
ever
been
earned
by
the
seaman.
whether
the
shipowner
in
good
faith
says,
you
did
not
ever
earn
them,
but
where
the
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
would
be
glad
to
your
honor.
in
coley,
the
excuse
was
based
upon
impossibility
of
performance.
in
mccray,
the
court
did
not
label
it
in
that
way,
but
its
ruling
clearly
indicates
it
was
also
impossibility
for
the
reason
that
the
seaman
made
his
application
for
wages.
he
was
told
by
the
captain
to
appear
at
the
consulate
the
following
day.
the
seaman
appeared
at
the
consulate
before
the
time
that
he
was
supposed
to.
he
was
not
there
when
the
captain
arrived
and
on
the
third
day
after
his
discharge
he
disappeared
entirely
and
the
court
said
this
made
it
impossible.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
your
honor
the
only
--
the
seaman
probably
would
have
stayed
out
there
if
he
had
been
given
the
opportunity.
seamen
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
shipping
list
when
they
are
brought
home.
if
they
stay
on
a
foreign
port,
they
are
in
a
very
good
position
to
go
immediately
to
work.
also
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
there
were
thousands
of
americans
there
and
if
the
consul
had
not
been
prevailed
upon
to
take
an
antagonistic
attitude
toward
the
seamen,
as
an
american
seaman,
he
had
a
right
to
stay
there.
there
were
thousands
of
americans
and
many,
many
american
seamen
in
the
hospital
there.
the
circumstances
of
currency
regulations
is
totally
irrelevant
here.
if
the
shipowner
wanted
to
send
him
home
and
the
man
did
not
object,
then
the
shipowner
was
acting
within
its
rights,
but
who
should
pay
the
bill
is
still
not
a
relevant
issue
before
this
court
now
because
--
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
yes,
there
is.
the
captain's
deposition
was
taken
at
norfolk
and
in
it
he
made
a
remark,
the
seaman
had
no
one
present
at
the
deposition,
but
even
so
the
captain
made
the
remark
that
the
coast
guard
had
informed
him
that
after
five
loggings,
a
seaman
could
be
forced
to
spend
his
money
to
send
him
home
which
i
think
is
a
clear
implication,
a
clear
insight
into
the
existing
relationships.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
well,
the
logical
thing
to
do
with
a
man
in
mr.
matise's
position
was
to
keep
him
on
the
ship,
dis-rate
him
and
keep
him
aboard
the
vessel,
at
least
until
the
port
that
did
not
offer
financial
problems,
but
bring
him
home.
he
could
have
been
imprisoned
aboard
the
vessel.
he
certainly
could
have
been
denied
his
wages,
but
there
was
no
requirement
to
put
him
off
the
vessel.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
well,
he
could
have,
i
think
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
the
captain’s
power.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
to
keep
him
aboard
the
vessel,
but
not
necessarily
in
confinement
when
a
man’s
misconduct
was
simply
a
failure
to
perform
his
duty
from
drinking.
he
could
have
--
there
used
to
be
many
times
when
seamen
were
brought
home
aboard
vessels
in
a
work-away
status
or
a
dis-rated.
the
practice
has
simply
been
adopted
by
shipowners
to
fly
a
man
home
immediately.
it
satisfies
the
local
government’s
requirements.
they
prefer
to
handle
the
money,
the
pay-off
in
san
francisco
or
in
their
home
office
and
it
satisfies
the
requirements
of
section
596.
but
it
is
definitely
something
that
the
shipowner
wants
done.
you
can
see
it
from
the
schwartz
case
where
the
seaman
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
ticket
and
the
shipowner
added
its
own
money.
it
is
a
clear
benefit
to
the
shipowner
and
i
think
based
upon
an
inescapable
duty
to
the
local
government
to
get
that
man
out
and
practically
speaking,
taking
him
out
means
bringing
him
to
the
united
states.
but
the
validity
of
the
claim
for
the
cost
of
the
air
fare
is
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
eric
j.
schmidt
it
is
irrelevant.
thank
you.
