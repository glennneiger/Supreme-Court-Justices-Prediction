justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
schmidt,
are
you
arguing
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
seaman
consent
to
payment
in
kind?
suppose
a
seaman
on
his
own
initiative
in
saigon,
for
example,
had
come
to
the
shipowner,
putting
all
the
currency
problems
and
regulations
aside,
and
said,
i
would
rather
you
buy
the
ticket
for
me,
i
am
not
really
very
smart
at
figuring
out
how
to
get
home
on
airlines.
will
you
go
down
and
buy
the
ticket
for
me?
are
you
saying
that
under
no
circumstances
does
consent
relieve
the
shipowner?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
under
nothing?
