mr.
frank
susman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
little
over
three
years
ago,
this
court
spoke
firmly
and
clearly,
not
as
an
advocate
of
abortion,
but
as
an
advocate
of
each
individual
woman’s
right
under
her
then
existing
particular
circumstances,
and
in
consultation
with
her
physician
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
subject
to
certain
and
delineating,
compelling
state
interest,
a
right
to
abortion
was
then
recognized
as
equal
to
the
right
to
bear
children.
in
the
intervening
three
years,
many
things
have
remained
static
and
many
other
things
have
changed.
unchanged
in
particular
are
certain
fundamental
observations
that
were
made
by
this
court
in
its
decision
in
roe
versus
wade.
this
includes
one;
the
fact
of
the
sensitive
and
emotional
nature
of
the
abortion
controversy
and
the
deep
and
seemingly
absolute
convictions
that
the
subject
inspires,
noted
by
the
court
at
page
116.
secondly,
was
the
support
of
the
court’s
position
by
broadly
based
and
concerned
organizations,
which
included
and
still
include
today
things
such
as
the
american
medical
association,
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologist,
the
american
public
health
association
and
the
american
bar
association,
also
noted
in
the
court’s
opinion,
at
pages
144
to
146.
and
thirdly,
was
the
relative
safety
of
abortion,
when
compared
to
the
mortality
risk
normally
associated
with
child
birth,
noted
by
the
court
at
page
149.
and
lastly,
was
the
observation
that
those
trained
in
the
respective
disciplines
of
medicine,
philosophy
and
theology,
are
unable
to
arrive
at
any
consensus
of
a
question
of
when
life
begins,
noted
by
the
court
at
page
159.
but
i
would
suggest
that
even
more
dramatic
are
those
changes
which
have
been
directly
wrought
by
those
--
the
court’s
decision
of
that
day.
the
first
is
that
septic
abortions
in
the
united
states
have
decreased
by
50%.
secondly,
maternal
mortality
associated
with
pregnancy
has
decreased
by
80%
in
the
united
states.
and
thirdly,
illegitimate
births
have
also
dramatically
decreased.
it
is
somehow
cruelly
ironic
that
that
area
of
medical
practice,
afforded
the
greatest
constitutional
protection
by
this
court,
is
the
same
area
of
medical
practice
over
which
the
state
of
missouri
has
seen
fit
to
exercise
the
greatest
legislative
control.
in
1971,
just
five
years
ago,
approximately
38%
of
the
world’s
population
had
access
to
safe
medical
and
legal
abortions.
only
five
years
later
now
in
1976,
two-thirds
of
the
world’s
population
enjoys
that
right.
no
democracy
has
ever
reversed
the
trend
of
liberalizing
abortion
once
accomplished
and
yet
the
district
court’s
opinion
below
has
severely
throttled
and
restricted
this
court’s
opinions
of
roe
versus
wade
and
doe
versus
bolton
and
has
hampered
the
medical
progress
and
the
reproductive
freedom
for
women,
granted
by
this
court
in
1973,
in
which
was
over
a
hundred
years
in
coming
to
pass.
in
addition,
there
is
a
side
effect
of
restrictive
abortions
and
particularly
those
in
the
second
trimester
and
that
is
that
it
threatens
to
cripple
all
of
the
advances
made
in
amniocentesis,
by
which
today
approximately
60
serious
genetic
chromosomal
disorders
can
now
be
diagnosed.
we
would
also
point
out
that
the
district
court’s
opinion
below,
is
the
only
federal
court
challenged
to
uphold
major
legislation
or
policy
in
the
area
of
abortion
since
january
22nd
of
1973.
in
all
other
cases
in
which
policy
or
legislation
was
challenged,
it
was
voided
as
not
meeting
the
requirements
of
roe
and
doe.
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
clear
under
the
holdings
in
gonzales
and
m.t.m.
this
court
in
roe
and
doe,
and
subsequent
courts,
which
have
had
little
difficulty
in
understanding
the
opinions
rendered
by
this
court,
have
set
up
certain
standards
and
tests
by
which
abortion
legislation
and
abortion
policy
is
to
be
judged
and
they
include
among
others;
number
one,
the
delineation
of
the
period
of
gestation
in
the
various
periods,
frequently
called
trimesters,
but
not
truly
so,
at
the
first
trimester
and
then
the
second
period
running
up
to
the
point
of
viability
and
the
period
afterwards.
they
have
consistently
held
that
regulations
not
observing
these
distinctions
as
set
forward
in
the
court’s
opinions
are
invalid.
secondly
is
the
test
of
equating
abortion
with
other
procedures,
a
test
first
enunciated
by
the
eight
circuit
in
a
case
entitled
doe
versus
pelker
(ph).
in
that
case
the
eight
circuit
pointed
out
that
anytime
the
states
seeks
to
single
out
abortion
from
among
the
hundreds
and
thousands
of
other
medical
and
surgical
procedures
for
special
attention,
it
has
imposed
an
extra
layer
of
regulation
and
an
extra
burden
and
thus
is
invalid.
thirdly
are
the
tests
referred
to
the
by
the
court
itself,
those
of
compelling
state
interest,
placing
a
stronger
burden
upon
the
state
who
attempts
to
pass
such
regulations.
along
with
the
compelling
state
interest
test
of
course,
is
the
fact
that
any
regulations
enacted,
which
conform
to
those
test
must
be
narrowly
drawn
and
we
suggest
as
we
will
go
through
each
of
these
sections
that
are
challenged
here
this
morning,
that
they
are
not
so
narrowly
drawn.
again,
is
a
test
which
is
required
that
abortion
be
treated
equally
with
childbirth
and
that
it
not
be
legislatively
disfavored
by
the
legislation
which
is
enacted,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
abortion
for
periods
well
into
the
second
trimester
are
still
safer
in
the
mortality
rates
for
childbirth.
and
lastly
as
the
observation,
the
effect
of
any
restrictions
upon
access
to
abortion
are
more
onerous
for
the
poor
and
for
the
young.
it
is
basically
of
course
very
difficult
to
go
into
any
great
detail
in
any
of
this
sections
due
to
the
time
that
it
is
allotted,
and
therefore,
we
will
attempt
to
only
take
them
in
order
as
they
appear
in
the
statute.
first
section
that
was
challenged
is
section
2(2),
which
involves
the
definition
of
viability.
the
statute
provides
that
viability
is
defined
as
follows,
“that
stage
of
fetal
development,
when
the
life
of
the
unborn
child
maybe
continued
indefinitely
outside
of
the
womb
by
natural
or
artificial
life
support
of
systems.”
this
section
needs
to
be
read
of
course
in
conjunction
with
section
5,
providing
the
no-abortion
not
necessary
for
life
or
health
maybe
performed
after
the
period
of
viability
as
statutorily
defined.
this
court
in
speaking
of
viability,
spoke
about
it
in
several
different
ways
and
on
three
separated
occasions.
first
on
page
160
of
the
decision
in
roe,
it
referred
the
viability
as
usually
being
placed
about
seven
months,
twenty-eight
weeks,
but
may
occur
earlier
even
at
twenty-four
weeks.
secondly,
on
page
163,
the
court
said
that
point
of
time
in
which
the
fetus
then
presumably
has
the
capability
of
meaningful
life
outside
the
mother’s
womb
and
in
the
third
place
also
on
page
160,
the
court
referred
to
when
the
fetus
is
potentially
able
to
live
outside
the
mother’s
womb
or
be
it
with
artificial
aid.
we
do
not
believe
as
the
state
contends
that
the
court
may
only
look
to
one
of
these
meanings,
and
thereby
incorporate
it
statutorily
into
the
statute.
we
believe
that
all
three
must
be
look
like
--
look
at
and
taken
as
a
group.
first
of
all
this
restriction
in
definition
invades
the
first
trimester.
by
the
mere
addition
of
the
word
indefinitely
which
do
not
appear
in
the
supreme
court’s
decision,
which
dictionary
is
defined
as
indeterminate,
it
provides
for
remote
possibility
even
for
seconds
of
survival,
and
yet
the
idea
of
brief
respiratory
gasp
or
fleeting
heartbeats
are
not
considered
by
the
american
college
of
obstetricians
and
gynecologists
as
life.
fleeting
heartbeats
and
respiratory
gasps
are
still
considered
to
qualify
as
a
stillbirth
under
those
definitions.
three
courts,
three
federal
courts
have
held
that
in
fact
this
court’s
language
as
to
twenty-eight
weeks,
but
perhaps
occurring
at
twenty-four
was
not
dicta.
that
in
fact
it
was
to
be
a
lower
limit
beyond
which
states
could
not
allow
viability
to
occur
under
then
existing
medical
evidence
before
this
court
in
1973.
the
problem
of
defining
viability
involves
whether
you
are
talking
about
a
remote
possibility
of
survival
as
opposed
to
perhaps
a
probability.
this
was
a
problem
in
the
now
celebrated
trial
of
dr.
ethan
(ph)
in
boston.
we
would
suggest
that
the
standard
be
as
follows;
that
there
be
a
irrebuttable
and
conclusive
presumption
that
viability
does
not
occur
before
twenty-four
weeks.
and
we
agree
with
the
three
federal
courts
that
have
interpreted
the
court's
decision
as
saying
that
this
was
not
intended
to
be
dicta,
but
was
to
be
a
holding.
and
we
further
believe
that
in
those
cases,
the
fetus
being
beyond
twenty-four
weeks
in
gestation,
that
the
state
has
a
burden
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
that
particular
fetus
in
question
would
have
survived
and
not
the
possibility.
the
fact
that
one
in
a
thousand
at
that
particular
stage
of
gestation
might
survive
is
no
answer
to
the
doctor
whose
faced
of
making
the
decision
at
the
time,
as
to
whether
the
particular
fetus
is
viable.
we
also
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
some
form
of
absolute
lower
limit,
because
in
practice
it
has
been
shown
that
the
physician
of
course
would
tend
to
err
on
the
side
of
safety
for
himself
and
the
legal
processes
and
not
necessarily
with
only
the
woman’s
interest
in
mind.
second
section
challenged
is
that
section
3(2)
requiring
patient's
consent.
this
makes
it
a
crime
to
perform
an
abortion
without
requiring
the
woman
to
certify
in
writing
that
her
consent
is
informed
and
freely
given
and
not
the
result
of
coercion.
it
applies
to
all
stages
of
pregnancy,
and
it
singles
out
abortion
from
all
other
medical
and
surgical
procedures
and
makes
the
physician
obtain
a
specific
form
of
consent
at
the
peril
of
being
convicted
of
a
crime.
mr.
frank
susman
the
obligation
--
mr.
frank
susman
i
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
are
referring
to
normal
patients
or
fetus’
surviving
birth.
i
believe
the
obligations
--
mr.
frank
susman
i
believe
the
--
mr.
frank
susman
legally,
i
do
not
--
if
we
are
trying
to
--
i
do
not
think
we
are
getting
into
the
good
samaritan
type
of
a
problem.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
he
has
an
obligation
--
mr.
frank
susman
under
the
normal
manslaughter-type
statutes,
to
use
the
ordinary
means
to
preserve
life,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
has
the
obligation
and
most
religious
groups
would
agree
that
there
is
no
obligation
to
use
extraordinary
methods
of
continuing
heartbeat
or
respiration.
he
certainly
has
the
obligation
to
use,
assuming
he
is
that
patient’s
physician,
he
has
the
obligation
under
the
normal
manslaughter
statutes
to
use
all
ordinary
means
to
preserve
life.
the
normal
consent,
the
physicians
always,
whether
minors
or
adults,
have
an
obligation
to
obtain
an
inform
consent.
the
reason
of
course
that
physician
is
normally
in
any
surgical
procedure
obtain
written
consents
from
the
patient,
is
to
have
some
record
and
to
protect
themselves
from
future
potential
civil
liability,
but
this
is
the
only
statute
making
it
a
crime
not
to
obtain
a
certain
type
of
consent.
the
fact
that
the
statute
requires
the
consent
in
this
case,
be
in
writing,
informed,
freely
given
and
not
the
result
of
coercion,
in
no
manner
accomplishes
that
fact.
it
does
not
in
any
way
guarantee
that
that
consent
is
informed,
freely
given
are
not
the
result
of
coercion.
it
merely
requires
the
woman
so
state.
mr.
frank
susman
if
the
requirement
were
to
single
out
abortion
from
all
the
hundreds
and
thousands
of
other
medical
and
surgical
procedures,
i
would.
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
frank
susman
i
believe
it
is,
but
if
abortion
again
is
to
be
singled
out
for
--
at
the
risk
of
criminal
peril,
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
sustained.
a
general
statute
requiring
informed
consent
of
all
procedures
would
be
acceptable.
mr.
frank
susman
i
believe
it
would,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
particular
statute
addresses
that
problem
because
it
does
not
in
any
way
define
what
constitutes
informed.
it
merely
states
that
it
must
be
informed.
it
does
not
state
as
to
whether
it
should
be
informed
as
to
the
procedures,
the
risk,
the
complications,
the
results.
it
gives
no
indication
again
at
the
risk
of
criminal
peril
to
the
physician
what
constitutes
an
informed
consent,
an
informed
consent
basically
in
civil
liability
--
civil
liability
cases
requires
extra
testimony
at
least
in
missouri
of
other
doctors
as
to
whether
or
not
the
consent
given
was
informed.
mr.
frank
susman
this
particular
--
because
patient
consent
clause
we
believe
is
invalid;
number
one
because
it
applies
to
all
trimesters
contrary
to
the
court’s
decision
in
roe.
secondly
--
mr.
frank
susman
it
did
not
deal
specifically
with
the
consents,
but
we
believe
that
the
court
stated
that
there
was
to
be
no
regulation
during
the
first
trimester.
this
we
believe
falls
into
the
area
of
regulation.
mr.
frank
susman
yes
we
would
and
that
is
part
of
it.
mr.
frank
susman
if
abortion
is
being
singled
out,
the
reporting
and
record
keeping
considerations
we
do
not
believe
that
it
can
be.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
i
think
all
of
these
rights
have
to
go
back
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
right
of
privacy
upon
which
the
court
based
its
decision
in
roe.
this
is
--
record-keeping
requirements,
the
patient’s
consent
requirements
have
been
judged
by
precious
courts
and
also
awarded
based
on
the
decisions
in
roe
and
doe,
of
infringing
into
the
first
trimester.
in
the
kentucky
case,
a
three-judge
federal
court
panel,
a
case
entitled
wolfe
versus
schroering,
specifically
held
in
regard
to
patient
consent
that
it
was
over
broad
because
it
also
involved
the
first
trimester.
in
addition,
the
hudson
panel
in
minnesota
voided
the
same
type
of
patient
consent
for
the
reasons
that
it
affected
the
first
trimester
and
also
it
singled
out
abortion,
and
it
was
unnecessary
for
either
maternal
or
fetal
health.
the
second
--
i
hope
i
have
answered
the
question,
the
second
question
--
the
section,
excuse
me.
the
second
section
challenged
is
section
3(3),
which
is
that
requiring
the
consent
of
a
woman’s
spouse
for
the
procedure.
this
question
is
really,
whether
or
not
the
husband
has
the
right
to
control
the
medical
treatment
of
his
wife.
the
question
of
course
was
not
decided
in
roe.
in
fact,
there
is
a
footnote
saying
there
was
no
need
to
decide
the
question
at
that
time.
approximately
nationwide
30%
of
the
women
obtaining
abortions
are
married.
we
believe
that
this
requirement
unduly
interferes
with
the
physician-patient
relationship,
and
injects
unnecessarily
the
husband
into
the
medical
consultation.
there
is
no
other
statute
in
the
state
of
missouri,
which
requires
spousal
consent
for
a
medical
act.
it
also,
there
is
no
room
for
compromise
in
such
a
section.
it
is
an
all
or
none
type
of
situation.
the
husband
either
is
given
a
veto
right
or
he
has
no
rights.
unfortunately,
there
is
very
little
room
for
compromise
in
this
type
of
a
situation.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
i
do
not.
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
so
--
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
it
is
less
--
i
think
it
would
be
harder
to
void
such
statutes
than
they
would
in
this
area.
there
has
been
a
constitutional
guarantees
to
reproductive
medicine
in
many
ways,
whether
be
contraception,
sterilization,
abortion,
and
that
type
of
constitutional
protection
and
guarantees
have
not
yet
been
extended
to
other
types
of
medical
procedures.
while
i
personally
believe
that
requiring
spousal
consent
for
any
type
of
surgery
is
invalid,
i
do
not
believe
the
decisions
of
this
court
addressed
--
have
gone
that
far,
but
i
would
personally
object
to
them.
this
provision
also
requires
and
applies
to
all
stages
of
pregnancy.
it
allows
the
decision
of
the
spouse
to
override
the
decision
of
a
woman
and
her
doctor.
all
the
doctors
at
trial
testified
that
it
was
not
normal
medical
practice
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
spouse
in
order
for
medical
procedures
upon
a
wife,
including
items
such
as
sterilization.
there
is
also
we
would
suggest
no
compelling
state
interest
for
maternal
health
in
requiring
the
spouse’s
consent.
the
state
suggests
that
the
reason
to
require
it
is
the
husband’s
interest,
not
in
the
fetus,
not
in
the
child,
but
the
husband’s
and
the
state's
compelling
state
interest
in
the
marital
relationship,
a
new
compelling
state
interest
and
one
not
mentioned
in
roe
and
doe.
first
of
all
of
course,
the
reason
that
the
husband’s
interest
is
in
the
marital
relationship
and
not
in
the
fetus
is,
that
the
statute
does
not
require
the
husband
be
the
father
of
the
fetus.
he
need
not
have
fathered
this
particular
pregnancy,
but
yet
his
consent
is
still
required.
in
addition,
he
may
not
even
be
locatable.
he
may
have
deserted
his
spouse
ten
years
previously,
and
if
she
does
not
know
where
she
is
he
still
must
require
his
consent
and
no
exceptions
are
made.
we
would
also
suggest
that
you
may
have
the
--
well,
have
the
case
where
the
father
has
not
fathered
the
pregnancy
or
the
fetus
and
yet
he
withholds
his
consent
for
the
woman,
and
then
would
have
no
legal
liability
for
the
upbringing
or
raising
of
the
child
because
it
would
not
be
his
child.
there
is
an
unanimous
line
of
cases
dealing
with
spousal
consent,
both
in
state
courts,
the
one
state
court
case
mainly
being
jones
versus
smith
in
florida.
punitive
fathers
have
also
been
held
in
the
decision
by
justice
stevens
in
doe
versus
bellin
memorial
hospital,
not
to
be
indispensable
parties
to
a
case
in
which
a
woman
sought
an
abortion
at
a
private
hospital.
other
federal
courts,
panels
in
doe
versus
rampton,
roe
versus
gerstein(ph)
and
three
or
four
others,
the
most
recent
not
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief
is
a
case
entitled
weekes
versus
cocnic
(ph)
decided
in
a
district
court
in
louisiana
in
january
of
this
year,
all
have
held
that
spousal
consent
is
a
void
requirement.
there
has
been
no
case
upholding
a
spousal
consent
clause.
missouri
does
not
seem
fit
to
require
spousal
consent
for
either
artificial
insemination,
sterilization,
or
hysterectomy,
or
any
other
procedure
for
that
matter.
the
next
section
would
be
section
3(4),
which
is
the
parental
consent.
this
also
interferes
with
the
doctor-patient
relationship.
again,
no
other
criminal
statute
singles
out
parental
consent
as
necessary
for
the
treatment
of
minors.
minors
in
missouri
may
specifically
be
treated
for
vd,
drugs
and
pregnancy,
excluding
abortion,
by
statute
without
knowledge,
without
consent
of
the
parents.
in
other
words,
they
may
perhaps
be
sterilized,
receive
contraception,
bear
children
and
do
all
the
other
pregnancy
and
appropriation-related
acts
without
the
consent
of
the
parents
with
the
sole
exception
of
abortion.
in
fact,
minors
for
example
who
already
have
children
were
now
widowed
and
divorced
with
children
under
18
would
still
require
consent
of
the
parents
for
any
future
pregnancy
in
order
to
terminate
it.
mr.
frank
susman
once
the
minor
would
be
married,
the
only
--
the
parental
consent
clause
only
applies
to
unmarried
minors
under
18.
if
she
became
married
then
she
would
switch
over
to
the
spousal
concern
clause.
so
she
is
going
--
mr.
frank
susman
even
if
she
already
had
children.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct,
which
bring
back
--
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
particularly
in
light
of
this
specific
stature
--
mr.
frank
susman
well,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
of
course
has
never
ruled
on
this
statute.
they
have
--
mr.
frank
susman
we
have
no
real,
to
my
knowledge,
no
real
emancipation
case.
this
has
been
a
problem
in
child
support
cases
arising
on
disillusions
of
marriages
and
there
are
no
hard
and
fast
cases
dealing
with
what
makes
a
minor
emancipated
in
the
state
of
missouri.
we
also
suggest
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest.
in
regard
to
both
the
spousal
and
the
parental
consent
clauses,
the
state
suggests
that
somehow
marital
harmony
will
be
preserved
by
requiring
the
consent
of
the
spouses
or
the
consent
of
the
parents
from
minor.
it
is
difficult
to
believe
how
marital
harmony
is
better
preserved
are
requiring
a
child
or
a
wife
to
have
a
child
he
does
not
want,
then
to
preserve
it
by
allowing
her
to
terminate
that
pregnancy
when
the
parents
or
the
husband
does
not
desire
her
to
do
so.
neither
one
we
suggest
that
contributes
to
marital
harmony,
and
neither
one
contributes
to
more
or
less
marital
harmony.
in
regard
to
parental
consent
we
should
also
note
that
the
morbidity
and
mortality
rates
for
minors
having
been
pregnant
are
much
greater
than
they
are
for
adults.
and
all
of
the
factors
that
this
court
recognized,
at
page
150
of
its
decision,
are
adversely
and
multiplied
for
minors
than
they
were
for
the
adults
then
under
consideration,
all
of
the
emotional
distress
and
psychological
burdens
that
an
unwanted
pregnancy
places.
again
in
the
case
of
parental
consent,
while
they
can
require
by
withholding
their
consent
a
child
to
have
--
to
give
birth,
the
parents
would
have
no
legal
obligation
or
responsibility
to
raise
that
child
or
that
grandchild.
it
would
solely
be
the
responsibility
for
her
life
of
the
minor,
the
unwed
minor.
in
analogous
situation
minors
have
been
held
in
two
recent
federal
court
cases
not
to
require
parental
consent
to
receive
contraception
and
we
suggest
that
these
cases
are
very
much
on
point.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do,
i
think
every
inform,
consent.
doctors
face
the
same
question
when
treating
an
adult.
the
mere
fact
that
the
adult
is
over
21
does
not
really
mean
automatically
that
she
is
capable
of
giving
an
informed
consent.
i
think
informed
consent
regardless
of
age
has
to
be
based
in
each
individual
case
upon
the
age,
maturity,
education,
intelligence
and
judgment
of
the
individual
then
confronting
the
physician
and
each
case
must
be
looked
at
independently
whether
over
or
under
the
age
of
majority.
i
would
--
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
not
correct.
if
the
physician
in
the
talking
with
the
child
and
the
patient,
the
minor
patient,
determines
that
she
is
incapable,
based
upon
the
various
factors
i
have
delineated
is
capable
of
giving
parental
consent,
then
i
think
of
course
the
right
to
give
or
to
withhold
must
pass
to
some
other
responsible
individual.
whether
or
not
it
should
be
the
parents,
whether
or
not
it
should
be
a
guardian
appointed
by
the
court
is
another
question,
but
if
a
minor
is
incapable
than
certainly
someone
else,
rather
than
to
have
the
decision
made
to
default.
i
will
reserve
whatever
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
frank
susman
while
realizing
that
marriage,
voting,
are
also
fundamental
rights
upon
which
the
state
has
imposed
certain
age
limits,
i
cannot
put
those
personally
in
the
same
class
as
an
abortion,
because
those
rights
to
marriage
and
those
rights
to
vote
are
only
postponed
for
a
limited
and
a
small
number
of
years,
they
are
rights
that
are
postponed
and
the
damage
for
postponing,
excuse
me?
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
if
you
look
at
the
alternatives
or
the
disastrous
consequences
of
postponing
for
three-years
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
marriage
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
terminate
a
pregnancy,
because
your
religious
beliefs
may
differ
from
most
of
your
parents
who
are
given
a
veto
right
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason
whatsoever
to
say
no,
i
cannot
not
put
them
into
the
same
class.
mr.
frank
susman
yes
i
do.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
the
malpractice,
civil
liability
of
problems
in
regard
to
giving
abortions
to
minors
is
no
more
nor
no
less
than
those
of
deciding
on
whether
or
not
any
patient,
regardless
of
age
is
giving
an
informed
consent
based
on
the
procedure
at
hand.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
certainly
--
mr.
frank
susman
--
the
number
of
twelve-year-old
girls
is
much
less
than
the
number
of
thirteen-year-old
girls,
but
i
would
not
be
willing
a
blanket
statement
that
there
are
no
twelve-year-old
girls
who
are
capable
of
giving
consent
to
an
abortion.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
believe
that
they
can,
particularly
in
light
of
in
this
particular
statute,
the
parents
can
say
no
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason
whatsoever,
even
the
difference
in
religious
beliefs
is
for
--
there
are
no
guidelines
under
which
their
consent
can
be
withheld,
it
is
completely
arbitrary.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
you
can
because
i
think
the
statute
is
so
literal
that
it
cannot
be
read
in
any
other
way.
you
must
have
a
parent
--
parental
consent
or
else
it
is
a
crime
for
the
doctor
to
perform
the
procedure
and
if
you
--
i
have
no
time
left.
mr.
frank
susman
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
words
if
i
could
about
saline
which
was
risen
and
which
i
was
not
able
to
reach
due
to
the
time
factors.
mr.
frank
susman
--thank
you.
mr.
frank
susman
first
of
all
the
testimony
was
unequivocal
that
saline
is
the
procedure
of
choice
for
post
first-trimester.
in
over
75%
of
all
cases
in
this
country,
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
that
prostaglandins
were
available
much
less
in
use
anywhere
in
the
state
of
missouri.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
fact,
they
are
not
presently
being
used
by
anyone
in
the
state
of
missouri
as
a
procedure.
in
addition
all
of
the
evidence
also
without
exception
showed
that
saline
is
still
safer
than
sal
--
i
am
sorry,
that
saline
--
saline
mortality
rates
are
less
than
those
of
natural
childbirth.
doctor
anderson,
the
appellees,
the
only
medical
witness
of
appellees
who
had
any
experience
in
the
abortion
field
testified
that
if
confronted
with
a
case
in
which
prostaglandins
were
contrary-indicated,
saline
would
be
his
procedure
of
choice.
i
would
only
conclude
by
saying
that
the
sole
exception
again
of
this
case,
all
of
the
statutes
in
each
and
every
one
of
this
sections,
has
been
reviewed
by
other
courts
adopted
by
the
states
and
on
each
and
every
occasion
was
struck
down.
we
would
implore
this
court
to
stand
by
the
language
and
intent
of
1973
decisions
and
not
to
allow
the
unwarranted
encumbrances
upon
the
rights
of
women
and
their
physicians,
to
drive
women
back
to
the
septic
and
illegal
avenues
of
relief
which
were
so
prevalent
prior
to
1973,
and
which
then
existed
as
the
only
avenues
of
relief
for
the
poor,
the
young
and
the
unsophisticated.
thank
you.
