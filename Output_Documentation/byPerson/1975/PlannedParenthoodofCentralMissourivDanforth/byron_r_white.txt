justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
susman,
do
you
disagree
with
judge
webster’s
view
on
the
parental
consent,
namely
that
depends
on
the
ability
of
the
mother
to
give
consent
rather
than
a
specific
age
or
do
you
say
no
consent
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
view
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
is
that
the
parental
consent
should
neither
be
required
for
any
age
or
any
state
of
mentality
or
anything
else
for
that
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun’s
question
about
hysterectomy.
is
it
your
answer
that
that
procedure
would
not
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
long
run
family
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
previously
i
thought
you
have
said
that
the
distinguishing
feature
of
this
statute
was
that
if
involved
the
only
procedure,
which
would
have
that
kind
of
effect
on
the
family,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
there
is
a
little
inconsistency?
