justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
have
any
objection
to
a
simple
requirement
that
the
consent
be
informed,
freely
given
and
so
forth,
if
it
were
not
required
to
be
in
writing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
have
said
this
was
the
general
standard
by
which
consent
was
judged
for
any
sort
of
an
operation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
legislature
had
determined
or
had
some
basis
for
deciding
that
in
a
particular
type
of
operation
there
was
more
reason
to
question
the
consents
that
were
given
than
in
another
type,
would
it
not
be
permitted
to
address
that
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
a
statutory
rape
that
can
be
committed
on
a
man
in
missouri?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
legislature
cannot
draw
any
line
on
the
basis
that
there
are
a
lot
more
thirteen-year-olds
who
are
capable
than
there
are
twelve-year-olds
who
are
capable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
tell
that
without
the
state
courts
ever
having
construed
the
statute?
