justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
these
cases
are
the
anticipated
corollaries
to
the
so-called
abortion
cases
of
roe
against
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton,
decided
in
1973.
the
case
has
raised
a
number
of
secondary
issues
that
are
important.
the
first
one
is
74-1151
and
74-1419.
planned
parenthood
of
central
missouri
against
danforth
in
a
reverse
title.
in
these
cases,
there
are
two
physicians
who
were
licensed
in
missouri
and
planned
parenthood,
a
not-for-profit
corporation,
brought
a
suit
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
missouri
abortion
statute
enacted
after
the
decisions
in
roe
and
in
doe.
a
number
of
the
provisions
of
the
missouri
statute
are
under
attack
but
not
all
of
them,
and
the
ones
challenged
specifically
are
a
provision,
section
2
(2),
defining
viability.
and
another
provision,
section
3
(2),
requiring
that
prior
to
submitting
to
an
abortion
during
the
first
12
weeks
of
pregnancy,
a
woman
must
consent
in
writing
to
that
procedure
and
must
also
certify
that
her
consent
is
informed
and
freely
given
and
is
not
the
result
of
coercion.
still
another
provision,
section
3
(3),
requiring
the
written
consent
of
the
spouse
of
the
woman
seeking
an
abortion
unless
a
licensed
physician
certifies
that
the
procedure
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
mother's
life.
another
provision
section
3
(4),
requiring
the
written
consent
of
a
parent
or
person
in
loco
parentis
of
an
unmarried
woman
under
18;
and
still
another
provision
section
6
(1),
requiring
the
physician
to
exercise
professional
care
to
preserve
the
life
and
health
of
the
fetus,
and
failing
which
he
is
deemed
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
subject
to
an
action
for
damages.
another
provision
section
7,
declaring
an
infant
who
survives
an
attempted
abortion
to
be
an
abandoned
ward
of
the
state,
and
depriving
the
mother
and
a
consenting
father
of
parental
rights.
section
9,
prohibiting
after
the
first
12
weeks
of
pregnancy,
the
abortion
procedure
known
as
saline
amniocentesis
and
finally
two
provisions,
sections
10
and
11,
that
prescribe
reporting
and
record-keeping
requirements
for
facilities
and
physicians
performing
abortions.
the
case
came
before
a
three-judge
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
missouri
in
st.
louis
and
that
court
ruled
that
the
two
physicians
had
standing
to
maintain
the
suit
and
thus
it
was
unnecessary
in
their
view
to
determine
whether
the
corporation
planned
parenthood
had
standing.
on
the
merits,
the
court
upheld
all
of
the
challenged
provisions
of
the
missouri
statute
except
the
one
dealing
with
the
exercise
of
professional
care
to
preserve
the
life
and
health
of
the
fetus.
the
court
was
unanimous
with
respect
to
the
section
defining
viability,
as
to
the
woman's
consent
and
as
to
the
record-keeping
provisions
and
they
were
unanimous
in
striking
down
the
section
6
(1)
that
i
refered
to
regarding
the
exercise
of
professional
care
to
protect
and
preserve
the
life
and
health
of
the
fetus.
on
the
other
sections,
i
divided
two
to
one.
and
both
sides
have
taken
appeals
here.
we
hold
today
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
as
follows.
first
that
the
physicians
appellants
do
have
standing
to
challenge
of
the
act,
except
with
respect
to
section
7
that
declared
a
surviving
infant
to
be
an
abandoned
ward
of
the
state.
we
hold
that
as
to
that
they
do
not
have
standing
and
as
a
consequence,
we
do
not
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
that
particular
section
of
the
missouri
act
and
further
we
decline
to
consider
here
them
the
standing
of
planned
parenthood
to
attack
the
section
for,
we
feel
at
that
question
appropriately
maybe
left
to
the
district
court
for
reconsideration
on
remand.
second,
as
to
the
definition
of
viability
in
the
missouri
act,
we
hold
and
we
do
so
unanimously,
that
the
act
does
not
conflict
with
the
definition
in
roe
against
wade.
we
conclude
that
the
missouri
definition
maintains
the
flexibility
of
the
term
viability
that
was
recognized
in
roe
in
1973.
next,
we
hold
that
the
provision
that
the
woman
must
consent
in
writing
to
the
abortion
procedure
and
certify
that
her
consent
is
informed
and
freely
given
and
is
not
the
result
of
coercion,
is
not
unconstitutional
and
our
holding
there
is
unanimous.
the
decision
to
abort
is
an
important
and
often
stressful
one.
and
we
conclude
that
the
awareness
of
the
decision
and
its
significance
constitutionally
maybe
assured
by
the
state
to
the
extent
of
requiring
the
prior
written
consent
as
the
statute
prescribes.
next
so
far
as
the
spousal
consent
provision
is
concerned,
the
court
today
holds
that
it
does
not
comport
with
the
standards
enunciated
in
roe
against
wade,
and
we
hold
it
unconstitutional,
since
the
state
cannot
delegate
to
a
spouse,
a
veto
power
which
the
state
itself
is
prohibited
from
exercising
during
the
first
trimester
of
pregnancy.
the
court
is
divided
as
to
this
one,
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
are
in
dissent.
passing
on
to
the
parental
requirement,
we
hold
that
the
state
may
not
constitutionally
impose
a
blanket
parental
consent
requirement,
such
as
the
missouri
statute
contains
as
a
condition
for
an
unmarried
minor's
abortion
during
the
first
12
weeks.
here
again,
the
court
is
divided
and
in
dissent
are
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
stevens
also
dissents
so
on
this
provision.
passing
on
to
the
proscription
by
the
missouri
legislature
of
the
use
of
saline
amniocentesis
after
the
first
12
weeks
of
pregnancy,
we
hold
that
this
is
arbitrary
and
is
failing
as
a
reasonable
protection
of
maternal
health.
we
feel
that
this
would
force
pregnancy
terminations
by
methods
more
dangerous
to
the
woman
than
the
method
proscribed.
and
here
again
the
court
is
in
division
and
in
dissent
are
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
so,
far
as
the
record
and
the
recording
and
reporting
requirements
set
forth
in
the
statute,
the
court
holds
that
it
may
well
be
useful
to
the
state's
interest
in
protecting
the
health
of
its
female
citizens
and
maybe
of
medical
value,
and
unanimously
we
hold
that
these
are
not
constitutionally
offensive,
particularly,
in
view
of
the
supporting
provisions
of
the
statute
as
to
confidentiality
and
as
to
the
period
of
retention
of
the
records.
we
agree
with
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
three-judges
below
that
the
requirement
of
section
6
(1)
as
to
the
preservation
of
a
life
and
health
of
the
fetus,
whatever
the
stage
of
pregnancy
is
impermissible
and
is
not
separable
from
the
rest
of
the
section.
we
point
out
that
a
physician's
criminal
failure
to
protect
the
life
born
infant,
surely
is
subject
to
prosecution
in
missouri
under
the
criminal
statutes
of
that
state.
mr.
justice
white
and
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
are
in
dissent
as
to
that
holding.
in
summary
then
the
result
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
is
affirmed
in
part
and
is
reversed
in
part
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
although
joining
the
court's
opinion
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion
and
is
joined
there
in
by
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
also
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part
and
concurring
in
part,
and
he
has
joined
in
that
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
