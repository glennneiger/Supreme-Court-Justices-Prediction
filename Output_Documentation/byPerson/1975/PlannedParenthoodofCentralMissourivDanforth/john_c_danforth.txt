mr.
john
c.
danforth
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
one
overriding
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
state
legislatures
still
retain
the
power
to
regulate
in
major
areas,
traditionally
within
their
power.
in
resolving
this
issue,
the
court
is
faced
with
several
very
important
sub
questions.
first,
does
the
state
legislature
still
have
the
power
to
define
the
terms
and
obligations
of
marriage?
second,
does
the
legislature
still
have
the
power
to
protect
minors
from
their
own
immaturity,
where
stressful
and
tenuous
decisions
must
be
made?
third,
does
the
legislature
still
have
the
power
to
enact
reasonable
regulations
of
a
trade
or
profession
for
the
sake
of
public
health,
safety
and
welfare?
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
missouri
that
the
answer
to
each
of
these
questions
is
yes.
first
with
respect
to
spousal
consent;
the
legislature
of
our
state
has
in
effect
said
through
the
statute
that
inherent
in
marriage
is
that
certain
decisions
are
made
jointly
by
husband
and
wife
or
they
are
not
made
at
all,
that
this
is
the
very
definition
of
what
marriage
is
all
about.
the
legislature
has
done
this
elsewhere,
not
only
in
the
state
of
missouri,
but
in
other
states
as
well.
for
example;
if
a
woman
has
given
birth
to
a
child
and
then
decides
that
she
wants
to
place
the
child
for
adoption,
if
the
woman
is
not
married,
she
alone
can
make
that
decision.
if
the
woman
is
married,
her
husband
must
join
in
that
decision
to
place
the
child
for
adoption.
the
right
to
consent
is
not
in
the
punitive
father
in
the
state
of
missouri.
the
right
to
consent
to
an
adoption
is
in
the
husband,
because
this
is
fundamental
decision
relating
to
what
the
family
is
all
about.
with
respect
to
artificial
inseminations,
those
states
which
have
legislated
on
this
subject
and
missouri
is
not
one
of
them,
have
provided
specifically
that
in
the
case
of
a
married
woman,
the
legitimization
of
the
child
depends
upon
the
consent
of
the
husband,
if
the
woman
is
married.
in
the
case
of
sterilization,
two
or
three
states
that
have
legislated
in
this
area
have
provided
expressly
that
if
the
woman
is
married,
her
husband
must
join
in
approval
of
sterilization,
missouri
is
not
one
of
those
states.
obviously,
legislatures
have
provided
all
over
the
country
that
where
real
property
is
conveyed
during
a
marriage,
the
husband
or
wife
must
join
and
consent
to
that
conveyance.
the
fact
that
the
matter
is
that
it
has
historically
been
the
job
and
the
province
of
state
legislatures
to
provide
by
legislation
that
certain
fundamental
decisions
for
the
marital
entity
have
to
be
made
by
both
parties,
especially
where
change
is
required.
and
this
definition
of
marriage,
this
power
of
legislatures
rather
than
the
courts,
to
define
what
marriage
is
all
about
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
for
at
least
the
last
one
hundred
years.
expressly
in
the
case
of
reynolds
versus
united
states,
which
incidentally
involve
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
namely
religion,
where
the
court
held
that
a
statute
prohibiting
polygamy
was
not
unconstitutional.
likewise
in
the
case
of
maynard
versus
hill,
decided
by
this
court
in
1888,
the
court
expressly
said
in
that
case
that
it
is
the
job
of
the
legislature
and
the
courts
to
define
the
meaning
of
marriage
and
terms
and
the
obligations
of
marriage
and
what
marriage
is
and
we
believe
that
this
power
which
has
always
been
in
the
legislature
should
be
in
the
legislature
now
as
well.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
that
is
right.
this
is
also
the
only
medical
procedure
or
the
most
striking
medical
procedure,
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
would
alter
the
nature
of
the
family
and
would
change
the
direction
that
the
family
has
taken.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
pardon?
mr.
john
c.
danforth
that
is
my
conclusion,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
no
sir,
no
consent
required
by
the
legislature
--
mr.
john
c.
danforth
well,
i
do
not
believe
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
general
assembly
to
cover
every
possible
type
of
medical
situation
and
the
series
substantiates
to
render
one
particular
statute
constitutional.
furthermore
you
have
a
case
where
the
woman
is
pregnant
and
is
married
where
something
has
happened
in
the
marriage
itself
and
that
condition
is
either
going
to
yield
to
an
addition
to
the
family
which
is
proximate
and
immediate,
or
it
is
going
to
be
aborted.
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
for
the
state
legislature
to
say
that
that
decision
can
be
and
must
be
jointly
made
and
that
there
is
no
constitutional
provision
which
provides
that
the
woman
and
the
woman
alone
without
the
consent
of
the
husband
can
make
that
kind
of
decision.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
legislature
could
so
provide
that
has
not
in
this
case,
i
think
that
the
issue
becomes
elevated
to
a
much
different
plain
when
the
birth
of
a
--
of
a
coming
child
is
involved
and
i
would
also
say
that
whereas
mr.
susman
said
that
if
the
husband
is
not
the
father
of
the
child,
he
has
no
legal
obligations.
i
think
that
is
just
wrong.
i
think
that
is
a
misstatement
of
law.
if
the
husband
approves
of
the
wife
having
the
baby,
he
assumes
responsibility
for
that
baby.
in
fact,
there
is
no
stronger
presumption
in
the
law
than
that
a
husband
is
in
fact
the
father
of
any
child
born
of
that
marriage.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
think
it
--
yes,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
c.
danforth
well,
i
think
that
this
type
of
statute
involving
an
abortion
is
a
change
in
a
family
situation
which
is
already
been
commenced,
that
is
the
future
baby
is
on
the
way,
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
the
legislature
could
reasonably
say
that
unlike
a
hysterectomy,
which
may
or
may
not
be
called
for
for
any
number
of
medical
reasons
and
abortion
which
is
essentially
an
elective
procedure
by
the
woman
which
terminates
the
pregnancy
is
one
that
the
husband
has
a
particular
interest
in.
i
would
point
out
also
that
the
legislature
obviously
does
regulate
the
institution
of
marriage
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
it
provides
the
statutes
under
which
people
become
married.
it
provides
the
grounds
for
divorce
and
the
procedures
for
that
divorce.
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state
do
prohibit
the
way
in
which
people
can
use
their
own
bodies
during
a
marriage.
adultery
and
bigamy
are
both
criminal
offenses
in
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know.
with
respect
to
the
requirement
of
parental
consent,
the
legislature
has
in
effect
said
in
the
statute
that
where
decisions
are
to
be
made,
minors,
that
is
people
under
the
age
of
18,
simply
do
not
have
the
maturity
to
make
this
kind
of
stressful
and
tenuous
decision.
the
statute
provides
only
for
the
consent
of
a
parent
if
a
child
has
not
yet
reached
her
18th
birthday.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
do
not
know
because
i
do
not
know
if
this
would
be
construed
as
being
the
necessary.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
yes.
however,
i
think
the
whole
point
in
what
the
court
stressed
in
roe
versus
wade
is
that
abortion,
unlike
most
medical
procedures,
is
generally
elective.
that
is
it
is
one
where
the
woman
makes
a
decision,
and
the
evidence
at
trial
is
that
decision
is
a
stressful
and
a
tenuous
decision,
it
is
a
difficult
decision.
in
roe
versus
wade,
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
important
point,
the
court
indicated
that
the
decision
to
have
an
abortion
was
a
decision
that
that
the
woman
should
make
in
consultation
with
her
responsible
physician.
but
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
there
is
no
consultation
with
the
physician
whatever,
that
the
physician
makes
no
decision
whatever.
that
in
fact
what
happens
is
that
the
physician
is
one
of
a
number
of
doctors
on
a
roster,
who
shows
up
for
say
one
morning
a
week
and
performs
in
a
period;
and
this
is
the
case
and
evidence
in
the
trial,
reproductive
health
services,
which
is
the
abortion
clinic
in
the
city
of
saint
louis,
the
physician
shows
up
and
in
a
period
of
three-and-a-half
hours
performs
eight
abortions
on
total
strangers
and
there
is
absolutely
no
counseling
or
medical
input
from
the
physician.
there
is
a
degree
of
counseling
from
people
who
appear
to
have
no
special
expertise
in
counseling,
no
knowledge
of
what
they
are
doing,
and
i
would
say
a
strong
presumption
in
their
case
that
they
have
some
extra
grind
in
seeing
that
abortions
are
conducted.
the
state
in
the
case
of
minors
does
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
regulate
and
limit
what
minors
can
do.
minors
are
not
treated
by
the
state
of
missouri
in
the
same
manner
as
adults.
minors
in
our
state
may
not
vote.
minors
may
not
buy
liquor.
minors
may
not
buy
cigarettes.
minors
may
not
sue
or
be
sued
without
a
guardian
ad
litem
or
a
next
friend.
minors
may
void
contracts.
minors
after
they
reach
majority
may
set
aside
real
estate
conveyances.
the
consent
of
a
parent
is
required
when
a
minor
marries.
the
consent
of
a
parent
is
required
in
missouri
when
a
minor
buys
firearms,
when
a
minor
buys
sells
property
to
a
pawn
broker
and
even
when
a
minor
goes
into
a
pool
hall
in
our
state,
the
consent
of
a
parent
is
required.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
think
it
would
be
a
battery.
but
--
mr.
john
c.
danforth
yes
sir
and
of
course
then
the
question
is
well
what
--
then
why
have
a
criminal
statute
and
of
course
the
reason
is
that
a
girl
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
seventeen
and
there
is
evidence
that
children
ten-years-old
have
sought
abortions
in
our
state,
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
that
the
oldest,
the
eighteenth
birthday,
going
off
secretly
to
have
an
abortion
and
having
it
and
not
telling
the
parent,
the
parent
would
be
none
the
wiser,
and
there
would
be
no
battery,
there
would
be
no
lawsuit
brought.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
do
not
know
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
yes.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
the
standard
practice,
and
this
was
the
evidence
of
the
trial,
the
standard
practice
was
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
law
and
of
course
now
the
effectiveness
has
been
stayed
by
this
court
so
i
think
it
is
probably
still
the
case,
is
that
the
standard
practice
was
to
obtain
the
written
consent
of
the
individual
and
also
the
written
consent
of
the
parent
if
the
individual
was
a
minor.
now,
an
argument
has
been
made
here
that
why
not
judge
this
case
on
its
own.
why
presume
that
every
child
under
the
age
of
eighteen
is
incapable
of
an
informed
consent,
but
the
legislature,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
provides
age
levels
for
voting,
for
drinking,
for
everything
else.
it
does
not
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
a
bright
mature
person
who
is
sixteen
or
seventeen
years
old
to
vote
in
the
state
of
missouri,
even
though
voting
is
a
fundamental
right.
it
would
be
absolutely
unworkable
to
try
to
judge
the
maturity
of
each
person
and
if
the
maturity
of
each
individual
minor
is
to
be
to
judged,
we
would
submit
that
the
parent
is
the
only
person
who
is
qualified
to
make
that
judgment.
i
think
anyone
who
has
ever
had
a
teenage
child
will
know
that
the
child,
one
minute
can
act
very
mature
and
the
next
minute
can
act
very
immature
and
an
amateur
councilor
on
the
basis
of
one
hour
of
amateur
counseling,
i
do
not
think
can
make
that
kind
of
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
child
is
mature
enough
to
have
an
abortion.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
well,
it
is
changing,
justice
blackmun.
it
was
twenty-one
and
it
has
been
in
the
process
of
change
in
our
legislature
to
eighteen.
now,
the
legislature
purported
to
change
the
age
majority
in
fell
swoop
by
simply
deleting
the
word
twenty-one
and
rewriting
eighteen,
that
was
held
unconstitutional
by
our
state
courts
and
now
is
taking
the
statute
seriatim
and
changing
them
from
twenty-one
to
eighteen.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
yes,
i
think
there
is
an
exception
for
age
to
agree
to
be
married.
that
is
the
age
where
parental
consent
is
required
for
marriage
and
statutory
rape
i
believe
is
different.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
think
it
is
fifteen
for
a
--
but
i
do
not
have
that
on
my
fingertips.
i
would
also
point
out
that
--
mr.
john
c.
danforth
eighteen.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
would
require
the
consent
of
a
parent?
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
do
not
think
so.
i
would
guess
it
would
be
void.
now,
that
section
of
the
statute
on
which
most
of
the
evidence
was
presented
at
trial
had
to
deal
with
the
prohibition
of
one
of
the
various
mid-trimester
means
of
abortion
called
saline
amniocentesis
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
missouri
general
assembly,
on
the
basis
of
hearings
that
were
held
and
medical
evidence
that
was
presented,
both
orally
and
written
medical
journals
that
were
presented,
determined
that
the
saline
method
of
abortion
was
the
most
dangerous
of
the
two
fundamental
alternative
methods
of
mid-trimester
abortion.
saline
is
not
a
first
trimester
method
of
abortion.
it
is
purely
a
post
first
trimester
abortion.
there
are
other
post
trimester
methods.
hysterectomy
and
hysterotomy
are
two.
they
are
concededly
more
dangerous
than
saline.
however,
where
hysterectomy
and
hysterotomy
are
called
for
there
is
no
alternative
to
them,
and
therefore,
the
general
assembly
had
outlawed
hysterectomies
and
hysterotomies,
it
would
have
outlawed
abortions
during
the
second
trimester,
and
it
did
not
do
so.
with
respect
to
saline,
there
is
an
alternate
method
of
abortion
in
mid-trimesters
called
prostaglandin.
prostaglandin
is
a
different
kind
of
method.
it
is
readily
available
and
it
is
safer
and
there
was
substantial
evidence
presented
to
the
general
assembly
for
this
point.
there
was
substantial
evidence
presented
at
trial
for
this
point,
including
the
testimony
of
the
chief
of
obstetrics
at
the
yale-new
haven
hospital,
who
said
that
if
in
his
opinion
if
a
doctor
used
saline
instead
of
prostaglandin,
the
doctor
would
be
liable
for
malpractice.
roe
versus
wade
of
course
allows
--
mr.
john
c.
danforth
i
am
sorry
sir?
mr.
john
c.
danforth
there
was
a
testimony
from
a
doctor
perinier
(ph)
in
new
york
who
is
probably
the
leading
practitioner
and
expert
in
the
field
of
saline,
and
he
felt
that
saline
was
a
very
safe
method
and
the
safest
method.
before
--
that
was
at
trial,
before
the
general
assembly
there
was
certainly
notice.
i
think
representatives
of
the
pro-abortion
groups
were
present
at
the
hearing.
i
am
not
sure
whether
or
not
evidence
was
presented
at
the
legislative
hearing
on
the
relative
safety
of
prostaglandin
and
saline.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
in
our
record?
yes
sir,
there
is,
the
testimony
of
doctor
anderson
about
the
availability
of
it.
doctor
anderson
testified
that
prostaglandin
had
been
approved,
after
a
trial
period,
approved
by
the
fda
for
use
as
of
january
1974.
that
the
uptron
(ph)
company
which
is
the
manufacturer
of
prostaglandin,
restricted
its
sale
to
certain
medical
centers
and
teaching
hospitals
for
the
first
six
months
of
1974,
so
that
as
he
put
it,
information
as
to
its
use
could
trickle
out
through
the
medical
community.
as
of
july
1974,
when
the
trial
of
--
or
when
doctor
anderson's
deposition
was
taken,
he
said
that
this
was
available
in
small
hospitals
also
throughout
the
country.
so
as
of
july
1974,
it
was
available
in
small
hospitals.
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
predicated
on
the
finding
of
alternative
methods
for
the
trimester
abortion.
there
are
certain
very
rare
cases,
statistically
very
rare
cases
where
prostaglandin
is
contrary-indicated,
and
those
very
rare
cases
substantially
less
than
one
percent
of
all
mid-trimester
abortions,
the
testimony
of
doctor
anderson
was
that
the
person
--
the
patient
could
be
treated
and
then
given
prostaglandin
after
the
treatment.
also,
in
addition
to
prostaglandin,
there
are
other
alternative
methods
called
mechanical
stimuli
which
can
be
used
to
accomplish
a
mid-trimester
abortion.
roe
versus
wade
of
course
allowed
the
state
to
promulgate
reasonable
regulations
for
maternal
health
after
the
first
trimester.
the
state
of
missouri,
our
state
legislature
did
in
fact
take
the
court
up
on
that
statement
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
prohibition
of
saline
is
all
about.
the
government
--
one
point
is
made
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
practice
medicine,
i
take
it
free
from
governmental
regulation.
we
simply
reject
that
theory
and
the
court
rejected
that
theory
in
the
case
of
unites
states
versus
moore,
which
you
decided
last
december,
involving
the
use
of
whatever
the
substitute
for
heroine
is
called
to
treat
heroin
addiction.
method,
thank
you
--
and
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
together
with
the
justice
department,
the
attorney
general
could
set
forth
the
permissible
standards
for
treating
heroin
addiction.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
yes
it
did,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
danforth
most
definitely
did.
both
oral
testimony
and
written
material,
medical
journal
articles
and
the
like
were
presented,
comparing
saline
with
prostaglandin
and
those
medical
journals
were
presented
to
the
district
court
in
this
case,
introduced
at
the
district
court
level
in
this
case
and
furthermore
there
were
public
hearings,
both
sides
had
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
--
mr.
john
c.
danforth
no,
that
is
right,
that
is
correct,
but
there
is
certainly
was
every
opportunity
to,
and
this
was
a
two-year
process
of
passing
this
law
and
went
through
two
legislative
sessions
and
the
question
of
saline
was
debated
both
in
hearings
and
on
floor
of
both
houses
of
the
state
legislature.
so,
it
was
not
a
kind
of
a
secret
move
to
push
across
prostaglandin.
i
do
not
believe,
and
it
is
the
position
of
our
state
that
roe
versus
wade
and
doe
versus
bolton,
so
exulted
the
constitutional
right
to
an
abortion,
that
all
of
these
traditional
areas
of
state
legislative
action
have
somehow
been
suddenly
wiped-out
as
a
result
of
roe
and
doe.
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
how
the
rights
to
an
abortion
can
be
used
to
wipe-out
the
state
traditional
authority
to
regulate
in
the
case
of
marriage,
in
the
case
of
protecting
minors
and
in
the
case
of
the
operation
of
a
trade
or
profession,
without
having
a
serious
of
pandora’s
boxes
open
with
the
respect
to
state
powers.
now,
we
think
for
example
that
if
the
state
cannot
define
the
terms
of
marriage
in
this
circumstance,
it
would
equally
fall
that
the
state
statute
requiring
special
consent
for
adoption,
placing
a
child
for
adoption
would
fall,
and
that
any
state
restraint
on
using
your
body
as
you
like
in
adultery
or
bigamy
that
those
prohibitions
would
fall
as
well.
if
a
minor
cannot
be
protected
from
her
own
improvidence
and
immaturity,
were
this
kind
of
stressful
and
tenuous
decision
is
called
for,
i
do
not
see
how
any
state
statute
treating
minors
different
--
differently
from
adults
could
pass
constitutional
muster
and
if
the
state
cannot
regulate
the
practice
of
medicine,
i
think
that
we
are
right
back
in
the
box
of
wagner
versus
new
york
and
the
cases
which
followed.
thank
you.
