does

the

of
person
by

chief

e.

chief

warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
susman.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
are
you
implying
that
the
state
of
missouri
has
the
right
and
still
has
the
reserve
right
to
legislate
in
these
other
areas
to
require,
for
example,
spousal
consent
for
sterilization
or
any
other
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
missouri,
under
the
contract
law,
is
apparent
as
in
most
states
liable
for
unnecessary
obligations
incurred
by
a
minor
child?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
the
child
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
the
parent
is
contracted
for
this
surgical
procedure,
the
parents
would
be
liable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
say
liable
if,
liable
if,
i
had
not
finished,
liable
if
there
could
be
a
showing
that
this
was
--
fell
within
the
category
of
necessaries?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
missouri
law,
if
an
abortion
were
performed
say
on
twelve-year-old
or
a
thirteen-year-old
girl,
in
this
clinic,
in
the
process
you
have
described
and
if
afterwards
she
said
that
her
--
that
she
was
incapable
of
giving
consent
because
of
her
immaturity
and
youth,
that
is
her
chronological
age
and
immaturity,
would
she
under
the
missouri
law
have
a
malpractice
suit
against
the
doctor
on
an
assault
to
take
the
theory?
chief
justice
warren
e.

battery
as
--
battery
type
of
theory,
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
missouri
or
any
other
states,
any
such
an
actions
for
malpractice
on
battery
theory
have
been
brought
by
minors,
is
there
any
history
of
that
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
doctor
in
those
circumstances,
let
us
say
a
twelve-year-old
girl,
under
missouri
practice
as
distinguished
from
statutory
requirement,
get
a
signed
consent
from
the
girl?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
any,
without
any
other,
the
intervention
of
any
other
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
statutory
age
again
of
consent
in
the
statutory
rape
area?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
age
for
a
minor
getting
married?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
eighteen,
well
for
fifteen
year
old
boy
or
girl
want
to
get
married,
what
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
--
what,
what
in
missouri
law
would
be
the
status
of
the
marriage
if
in
fact
clergyman
or
a
justice
of
peace
performed
it,
laying
aside
their
possible
criminal
violation,
would
it
be
a
valid
marriage?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
susman,
in
your
view,
do
the
statutory
provisions
in
missouri
fall
those
relating
to
the
necessity
of
parental
consent
for
marriage
as
a
person
is
under
age
eighteen
and
others
like
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
answer
is
that
the
statutory
rape
age
limits
will
survive
and
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
put
the
statutory
rape
age
limit
in
the
same
category,
if
that
is
a
valid?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
any
comment
on
the
problem
of
a
malpractice
suit
against
a
doctor
based
on
the
claim
that
the
state
by
statute
has
said
that
a
minor
at
the
age
of
twelve
or
thirteen
cannot
legally
consent
in
a
rape
case,
therefore,
it
should
follow,
would
that
be
the
argument,
it
cannot
consent
to
abortion,
and
therefore,
rendered
the
doctor,
the
aborting
doctor
liable
of
malpractice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
a
twelve-year-old
girl
is
capable
of
giving
an
informed
consent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
an
abortion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
