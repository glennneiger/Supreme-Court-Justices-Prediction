mr.
jonathan
wallas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
plaintiffs
feel
that
it
is
important
at
the
outset
to
emphasize
the
narrow
scope
of
the
district
court
order
which
is
now
the
subject
of
review
in
this
court.
the
limiting
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
reads
as
follows:
so
long
as
the
defendants
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor
that
is
in
page,
that
is
at
page
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
page
a-14
of
the
petition,
your
honor,
the
very
last
page
i
believe,
in
paragraph
four
that
reads
as
follows:
“so
long
as
the
defendants
continue
without
clearly
stated
in
fair
standards
to
withhold
moneys
from
the
paychecks
of
city
employees
for
other
purposes,
organizations
and
entities,
not
specifically
required
by
law.
the
defendants,
the
agents,
the
successors,
employees
and
any
person
acting
in
concert
with
the
defendants
or
at
their
direction
are
enjoined
from
refusing
the
withholding
moneys
from
the
paychecks
of
individual
plaintiffs
to
be
paid
to
local
660.”
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor
the
reason
to
that
would
not
satisfy
us
because
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
contrary
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
if
i
may
start
out
by
answering
that
question
in
this
way,
contrary
to
what
mr.
watts
has
asserted
in
court
today
that
is
that
the
standard
that
the
policy
that
the
city
uses
is
a
policy
to
allow
all
employees
in
a
unit
any
trial
deduction
where
all
employees
and
in
a
unit
can
participate.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes
sir.
now
that
is
the
policy
that
mr.
watts
is
asserting
here
today
and
he
is
saying
that
the
policy
that
the
city
has
adopted
and
has
followed.
now
if
you
will
look
at
page
2
of
the
petition
you
will
see
that
the
first
question
which
was
addressed
to
this
court
reads:
“have
petitioners
by
following
a
policy
of
allowing
only
payroll
withholdings
which
benefit
all
of
its
employees
established
a
rational
basis
etcetera.”
now
the
reason
that
is
important
is
that
the
district
court
in
this
case,
found
on
page
a-10
that
the
practice
had
meant
to
allow
those
deductions
which
were
available
to
all
city
employees,
that
would
be
employees
of
all
of
the
departments
in
the
city,
or
those
programs
that
were
available
to
employees
within
a
single
department
and
that
would
be
the
fire
department
for
example,
to
allow
deductions
that
were
available
in
those
circumstances.
and
since
the
deduction
that
we
request,
i.e.
deduction
for
union
dues
is
available
to
all
employees
within
the
fire
department,
then
the
court
said,
well,
you
can
not
deny
this
deduction;
that
is
the
deduction
that
happens
to
run
to
a
labor
organization
while
you
are
allowing
other
deductions
that
only
run
to
or
only
to
benefit
people
in
a
particular
department.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
your
honor,
the
point
is
that,
that
is
the
number
of
members
of
the
fire
department
that
have
decided
to
join
the
union
as
of
a
particular
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
that
would
be
a
possibility.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
it
would
be
available,
this
union,
local
660
is
available
to
all
of
the
employees.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
--
that
would
not
be
required
by
this
order,
and
that
is
why
i
read
the
order
right
now.
i
think
what
the
city
has
to
do
is
simply
establish
some
reasonable
standards
to
apply
it
to
everyone.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
what
the
judge
is
saying
there
that
the
city
has
to
establish
a
rational
basis
for
their
actions,
a
rational
basis
furthering
the
legitimate
state
goal.
i
do
not
think
he
means
anything
other
than
that.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
that
on
this
record
they
are
required
because
on
this
record
they
did
not
do
what
--
their
practice
was
not
what
their
policy
was.
at
beginning
of
the
litigation
we
filed
some
interrogatories
and
in
the
interrogatory
number
four
we
ask
the
city
to
state
the
criteria
which
they
used
to
decide
which
withholding
to
allow
and
which
withholding
not
to
allow,
and
when
they
answered
that
interrogatory
on
page
14
of
the
appendix,
they
did
not
set
forth
any
criteria.
they
just
said,
“this
is
what
we
do.”
later
on
in
the
litigation,
in
an
affidavit
filed
by
the
city
manager
and
an
affidavit
filed
by
the
personnel
director,
they
said,
“our
policy
is
to
allow
those
deductions
which
every
employee
within
the
city
can
avail
themselves
of.”
judge
mcmillan
then
looked
at
those
things
that
they
actually
allow,
i.e.
those
deductions
of
the
14,
and
we
argued
to
the
court
and
it
was
obvious
from
the
record,
from
the
answers
to
the
interrogators
that
there
were
certain
deductions
that
could
only
--
that
will
allow
that
only
employees
in
the
certain
department
could
benefit
from
them.
and
our
argument
to
the
court
was,
well
if
that
is
really
the
practice
of
the
city,
what
they
do,
then
we
think
we
should
be
able
to
avail
ourselves
of
that
benefit.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor
i
think
the
reason
that
i
read
that
the
order
that
i
did
is
that
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
they
would
not
allow
that.
i
think
mr.
watts
mentioned
too
that
they
would
not
allow
that
deduction.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
the
difference
in
that
case
--
i
am
not
sure
there
is
a
difference
from
that
case,
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
that
they
are
free
to
develop
some
standards
where
they
could
deny
that
type
of
perception.
they
are
also
probably
free
to
develop
some
standards
where
our
deduction
would
be
allowed
--
disallowed.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
your
honor,
like
i
say,
i
think
that
is
really
saying
you
have
got
to
establish
a
rational
basis
for
your
actions.
the
court
is
saying
--
what
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
is
that
you
are
saying,
as
your
honor
points
out,
you
are
saying
one
thing
and
doing
another
doing
another.
and
that
is
just
not
permissible,
because
what
you
are
doing
or
maybe
doing
is
letting
the
benefits
of
withholding
which
is
simply
the
use
of
the
city’s
computer
in
this
case
to
flow
to
certain
organizations
and
entities
while
prohibiting
that
flow
to
this
union.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
what
the
court
is
saying
is
until
you
change
your
practice,
then
you
must
do
this.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
i
would
concede
that
the
city
of
charlotte
can
discourage
the
unions
per
se.
what
they
can
not
do
is
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
in
doing
that.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
that
your
honor,
i
think
is
singling
out
of
an
unfavorite
group
for
--
and
denying
to
them
benefits
that
you
give
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
right.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
absolutely,
it
may
very
well
be
rational
and
the
test
of
course
is,
is
this
a
rational
--
is
it
that
fosters
a
illegitimate
state
interest.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
we
do
not
think
you
have
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
your
honor
most
of
the
equal
protection
cases
involved
or
a
lot
of
the
equal
protection
cases
in
this
case
like
the
mosley
case,
(inaudible)
case
involved,
first
amendment
freedoms
are
involved,
but
you
take
for
example
mosley.
now
that
case
could
not
be
decided
or
would
not
have
been
decided
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
as
i
understand
justice
marshall’s
opinion
without
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
is,
this
court
has
clearly
said
that
picketing
can
be
limited
by
time,
place
and
manner,
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
rules.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
rule,
as
i
recall
only
union
picketing
was
allowed.
and
this
court
said,
well,
you
just
can
not
--
you
can
not
allow
picketing
for
one
group
and
not
allow
picketing
for
other
groups
in
the
equal
protection
argument.
and
that
is
the
argument
we
are
making
here.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
what
we
are
comparing
is
the
fact
that
certain
benefits
are
flowing
in
different
areas.
now
the
benefits
flow
to
seven
different
organizations
or
groups
of
employees
who
happen
to
opt
for
those
deductions.
under
the
policy
of
the
city
that
mr.
watts
in
his
argument
said
is
their
policy,
that
is
that
all
--
if
an
option
is
available
to
all
city
employees
then
the
city
will
avail
them.
well,
our
option
is
the
same,
and
we
think
that
those
employees
within
the
fire
department
who
want
benefits
to
flow
to
their
union;
all
of
this
is
a
simple
computer
operation.
i
think
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
the
record
makes
it
clear
that
this
is
not
when
i
asked
him
to
burden
the
city.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
i
do
not
understand
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
the
city
--
again,
your
honor,
the
reason
i
read
the
injunction
that
i
did,
the
city
is
free
to
adopt
the
policy
that
they
may
make
it
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
my
understanding
was
that
he
said,
“as
long
as
all
the
employees
in
the
department
could
avail
themselves
of
that
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
the
policy
is
whether
the
members
of
that
particular
department
can
avail
themselves
of
that
deduction
and
as
we
said
in
a
brief
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
different
basis
that
the
city
could
set
up.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
each
check
off,
of
course,
is
and
of
itself.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
believe
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
no,
i
believe
that
is
incorrect.
i
believe
that
there
are
in
the
fire
department,
there
is
firemen’s
benefit
fund
and
there
is
also
a
medical
insurance
and
life
insurance
fund.
so
the
firemen
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
and
all
firemen
are
eligible
to
the
check
off
to
the
union.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes,
that
is
correct
there
are
whole
variety
of
options
but
each
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
that
is
not
what
i
understand
the
policy
to
be.
my
understanding
of
the
policy
is
that
if
it
is
available
to
everyone
in
the
department
then
they
allow
it
and
that
is
what
i
understand
the
judge
found.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
no
sir,
may
not
--
well
the
law
the
statute
service
they
might
not
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
contract
or
agreement.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
prohibit
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
at
least
at
some
point
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
it
there;
my
understanding
is
that
the
city
will
talk
to
an
employee
as
an
employee
but
refuses
really
to
talk
to
an
officer
of
the
union
as
an
officer
of
the
union,
i.e.
if
i
am
the
president
of
the
union
i
want
to
come
in
and
represent
my
union,
the
city
will
say
come
on
in
and
we
will
talk
to
you
as
an
employee.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well
i
think
we
presented
a
request
and
it
was
denied,
in
essence
there
was
a
colloquy,
it
that
is
considered
to
colloquy
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
the
individual
employees
in
this
case
have
presented
to
us
as
an
individual
--
both
as
individuals
and
have
actions
both
as
individual
and
as
officers
of
the
union.
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
we
would
contend
that
this
case
as
i
said
before
fits
the
traditional
equal
protection
mold.
that
is
that
just
as
the
city
does
not
have
to
build
a
municipal
auditorium,
it
does
not
have
to
create
a
public
park,
it
does
not
have
to
necessarily
allow
the
use
of
their
computer
to
handout
or
to
allow
withholding.
but
once
it
is
does
it
can
not
discriminate
against
certain
unfavored
groups
in
favor
of
certain
favored
groups.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor
i
think
they
might
be
able
too,
but
i
think
that
the
importance
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
it
does
not
bother
me
because
the
district
court
order
makes
it
absolutely
clear
and
the
court
of
appeals
order
makes
it
doubly
clear,
reinforces
the
district
court
order
that
the
city
can
establish
some
guidelines,
some
standards
and
apply
them
equally
to
everybody
and
as
long
as
it
does
there
are
there
is
some
rational
basis,
furthering
some
legitimate
purpose,
then
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
that
under
their
present
policy
they
may
have
to
do
it.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes
your
honor.
but
they
can
always
set
up
reasonable
policy
--
we
have
suggested
on
brief
some
possible
bases
they
could
use.
there
are
many
other
bases
that
we
think
could
be
used.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
thank
you.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
now
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
asking
assuming
mr.
justice
that
the
policy
is
the
one
that
you
have
set
forth
and
again
i
would
contend
that
the
policy
is
not
that.
but
assuming
that
the
policy
is
to
allow
only
one
charity
to
deduction
that,
only
one
insurance
company
deduction
we
would
contend
that
we
fall
within
that
policy.
local
660
is
the
only
union
that
has
come
forward
and
said
that
it
is
willing
to
represent
this
firm.
we
are
open
to
all
firm,
and
in
that
sense
we
contend
that
we
are
within
the
policy
as
we
understand
policy
being
that
as
long
as
an
organization
is
open
to
all
members
of
a
particular
department
then
we
are
in
the
policy.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
address
myself
to
every
single
to
took
to
your
question
and
say
to
firm
with
you
that
every
single
decision
that
is
made
by
governmental
body
falls
within
that.
what
we
are
saying
here
and
what
i
understand
the
city
has
asserted
is
that
they
have
unfettered
discretion
to
decide
which
withholdings
to
allow
and
which
withholdings
not
to
allow.
because
they
have
a
policy
within
which
we
fall
and
yet
they
say,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
your
deduction.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
do
not
know
where
the
line
is,
it
maybe
a
threshold
below
where
the
courts
inquire
but
do
not
have
to
inquire.
but
it
seems
that
if
the
city,
in
that
instance,
was
making
its
design
and
its
policy
be
treat
union
members
as
union
members
in
one
way
and
everyone
else
in
another
way
that
would
have
the
policy
that
would
have
to
fall
into
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
your
honor,
i
think
you
said
a
social
gathering
of
some
fire
department
employees
on
one
hand,
i
take
it
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
--
and
then
a
business
meeting
of
the
union
on
the
other
hand.
if
it
was
a
social
gathering
of
the
union
--
what
i
am
saying
is
maybe
a
distinction
between
the
type
of
meetings
that
you
are
asserting.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
okay
if
you
make
it
a
social
gathering
of
the
union
then
i
would
say
that
the
denying
that
to
the
union.
because
it
is
the
union
would
be
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
the
cases
new
(inaudible)
is
a
park.
if
everybody
else
can
use
the
park
but
you
(inaudible)
witnesses
that
it
is
allowed
to
use
the
park
unless
the
state
--
in
that
case
it
can
show
a
compelling
stay
interest
while
that
should
not
be
allowed.
similarly
in
this
case
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
believe
it
was
your
honor;
i
believe
it
was
a
first
amended
case,
but
i
believe
the
equal
protection
clause
is
one
of
cases
that
justice
marshall
write
on
in
mosley.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
yes
sir.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
believe
it
was.
that
is
my
point
is
that
their
first
amendment
right
that
may
exist
but
this
court
in
many
cases
they
say
these
rights
are
not
--
that
there
are
limitations
on
these
rights
and
when
limitations
are
imposed
the
equal
protection
clause
comes
in
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
imposed
in
a
discriminatory
way.
our
contingent
here
is
that
the
city’s
position
that
they
have
the
unfettered
right
to
deny
the
withholding
benefit
to
plaintiffs
in
this
case
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
below
did
not
say
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
fact
specifically
says
to
the
contrary.
it
does
not
say
that
dues
check
off
is
a
absolute
right,
there
is
any
purse
right
to
check
off.
the
check
off
only
is
require
in
this
case
on
this
record,
because
we
fall
within
the
policy
that
the
city
has
been
following
consistently,
and
importantly
as
i
am
trying
to
emphasize
the
initial
part
of
my
argument
the
city
is
free
if
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
it
will
your
honor
and
--
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
i
think
that
i
may
have
misunderstood
one
of
the
chief
justice’s
questions;
i
think
he
may
have
asked
me,
i
am
not
sure,
whether
if
the
state
could
legislate
and
say
we
are
going
to
allow
all
withholdings
except
those
that
go
to
a
union
because
we
are
opposed
the
union.
i
think
that
falls
right
with
the
equal
protection
analysis
that
we
have
tried
to
present
in
our
brief.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
because
it
would
be
illegitimately
attacking
this
union
because
it
was
an
unfavored
group,
then
we
would
be
talking
more
about
the
first
amendment
question
that
justice
white
raised.
mr.
jonathan
wallas
well,
we
would
be
then
in
this
court
invoking
the
first
amendment
right
of
association
which
was
involved
in
the
atkins
case
to
attack
the
sister
statute
of
95
based
98,
that
is
95
based
97,
which
be
made
it
a
criminal
offence
for
a
firemen
to
be
a
member
of
union,
and
that
was
attacked
in
the
atkins
case
and
that
of
course
fail
on
first
amendment
grounds.
and
i
think
that
the
statute
or
the
policy
will
also
have
to
fall
on
first
amendment
grounds
if
the
union
was
picked
out
as
one
group
and
all
other
groups
were
allowed
withholding.
then
no
other
questions
i
would
conclude.
thank
you.
