mr.
wallas
suppose
the
355
once
said
they
want
to
give
their
money
to
the
first
methodist
church
of
charlotte
and
the
other
said
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
obviously,
that
would
be
within
the
guidelines
and
they
would
not
allow
it,
would
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
between
that
in
this
case
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
one
was
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
if
they
all
want
to
give
it
to
the
methodist
church
but
it
was
not
the
whole
bunch,
it
was
just
a
percentage
of
them,
it
would
be
alright
for
them
to
deny.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
refusal
of
the
petitioner,
the
city
of
charlotte,
north
carolina
to
allow
a
dues
check-off
for
the
local
660
and
its
members
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
north
carolina
found
the
city's
refusal
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
city
of
charlotte
refuses
to
allow
check-offs
unless
the
check-off
benefits
all
city
employees
or
all
employees
of
a
single
department.
since
the
union
represents
only
351
of
the
543
uniformed
members
of
the
fire
department,
it
is
not
eligible
for
check-off
under
this
policy,
and
we
find
the
policy
is
sufficiently
reasonable
to
survive
a
equal
protection
attack.
the
policy
is
a
legitimate
method
for
avoiding
the
burden
of
withholding
money
for
all
purposes
or
organizations
that
request
a
check-off.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
statement,
concurring
in
the
judgment.
