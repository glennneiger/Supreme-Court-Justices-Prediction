justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
aid
the
union
in
any
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
court
says,
look,
you
have
given
a
reason
for
distinguishing
between
the
check
offs
for
unions
and
others,
but
that
reason
is
a
very
bad
reason,
it
is
unacceptable,
but
we
can
think
of
a
very
good
one,
the
court
said.
for
example,
you
just
do
not
want
to
encourage
union.
whether
you
think
so
or
not,
that
is
as
far
as
where
the
court
is
concerned,
that
is
a
perfectly
justifiable
reason,
and
maybe
you
do
not
think
you
are
following
it
but
nevertheless
we
can
not
strike
it
down,
because
we
can
imagine
that
there
are
the
basis
for
this
classification.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
say
that
the
reason
we
do
not
check
off
for
unions
is
that
we
do
not
want
to
help
unions,
and
then
checking
off
dues
helps
unions.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
cannot
say
that
it
is
not
a
rational
basis.
you
can
say
it
is
an
unconstitutional
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
pretty
irrational,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
are
down
to
the
legitimate
end.
do
you
think
the
city
must
help
the
union
by
checking
off
or
it
will
violate
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do.
we
are
just
there
--
we
just
reached
it
a
minute
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
city
barred
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
union
may
talk
to
the
city
about
working
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
