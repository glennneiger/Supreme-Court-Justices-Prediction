well,
even
if
they
were
the
same
kind
of
item
as
the
other
items,
would
it
be
an
equal
protection
case?(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
arguing
that
the
classification
is
reasonable
rather
than
arguing
that
is
not
an
equal
protection
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
your
argument
fail
if
there
were
rational
basis
for
an
exemption
form
the
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
mr.
justice
whiteâ€™s
question
then,
is
that
a
rational
basis
for
the
city
to
say,
they
do
not
want
encourage
union?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
a
rational;
that
is
irrational.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
is
irrational
or
because
you
need
compelling
state
interest
to
make
that
exception?
which
is
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
it
would
be
so
illegitimate
or
it
could
not
be
done
no
matter
what
the
reason,
is
what
you
are
saying?
