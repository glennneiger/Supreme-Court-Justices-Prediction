justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
say
mr.
watts
that
all
of
these
items
then
were
available
to
all
employees?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
the
dues
check
off
to
the
same
union;
why
would
that
qualify?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
there
was.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
they
forbid
it
by
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
municipal
employees
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
with
that
if
you
answer
my
earlier
question
was
you
said
in
any
event
there
is
a
policy.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
a
key
element
of
the
policy
is
that
the
city
is
not
going
to
pay
at
the
request
of
employees
to
any
except
that
which
is
a
single
organization
beyond
in
any
event
that
which
by
statute
you
are
compelled
to
check
off
income
taxes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
you
uniformly
apply
that
policy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
uniformly
apply
it
because
you
say
you
would
not
check
off
for
individual
churches?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
individual
clubs,
social
clubs
because
that
is
outside
the
policy
of
requiring
a
single
recipient.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
and
that
you
apply
that
uniformly?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
would
not
do
it
here
because
there
maybe
more
than
one
union?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
your
equal
protection
argument
is
answered
by
the
answer
you
have
given
me,
you
do
not
have
to
reach
the
second
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
the
constituency
to
fire
department’s
500
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
about
350
union
members.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
will
i
suppose
some
of
the
others
wanted
to
join
a
different
union?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
that
happens
then
the
check
off
would
violate
the
policy
against
allowing
it
except
where
available
to
all
employees,
with
a
single
recipient,
would
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
only
you
and
union
there
now
as
opposed
the
chief
justice
suggested
and
some
of
the
other
firemen
organize
another
union
and
then
they
want
to
have
a
check
off
to
their
union.
and,
no,
it
is
not
the
city
then
in
the
position
where
it
has
to
violate
its
policy
which
is,
i
understand
it
is,
the
mid
check
off
only
where
there
is
a
single
recipient.
in
other
words,
you
make
a
contract
with
an
insurance
company
for
group
premiums
and
you
pay
up
to
a
single
insurance
company.
all
employees
take
advantage
of
it
if
they
want
to
pay
up
a
new
single
insurance
company.
but
where
you
get
two
unions,
that
is
not
the
situation
then.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
but
i
thought
you
agreed
earlier.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
but
what
mr.
watts
has
told
us
namely
that
the
key
to
that
check
off
policy
is
that
there
maybe
as
to
all
participating
employees,
a
payment
to
a
single
entity
either
an
insurance
company,
united
way
as
the
case
maybe.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
and
when
they
do,
they
check
off,
what
is
checked
off
is
paid
to
a
single
identifiable
entity.
united
way
insurance
company
and
alike,
that
is
what
i
understood
in
this.
is
that
not
the
policy,
and
is
that
not
what
you
pointed
out
to
as
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
policy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
whether
as
to
any
of
the
14,
well
i
guess
it
is
only
seven
because
seven
are
check
offs
required
by
law,
i
gather,
income
taxes
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
as
to
any
of
the
seven
which
are
not
check
offs
required
by
law,
under
the
city
policy,
is
any
check
off
paid
to
more
than
one
recipient?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
all
firemen
are
eligible
to
have
check
offs
to
either
entity.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
so
that
if
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
but
the
recipients
in
each
case
are
just
a
single
for
each
check
off,
is
that
right?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
do
not
make
a
charitable
contribution
except
the
united
way,
is
that
right?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
had
two
or
three
that
would
not
allow
the
check
off,
as
i
understand
mr.
watts’
description,
the
policy
is.
