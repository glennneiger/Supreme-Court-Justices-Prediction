justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
go
on
that,
you
referred
a
moment
ago
to
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
i
noticed
that
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
at
page
813
of
your
petition,
commented
that
desire
to
discourage
municipal
labor
organizations
would,
of
course,
be
an
impermissible
reason
for
refusing
to
withhold
moneys.
do
you
have
any
idea
why
he
said
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
state
of
north
carolina
attempts
to
discourage
municipal
labor
union
by
its
statute.
is
that
an
impermissible
purpose
for
the
state
of
north
carolina?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what
case
of
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
not
a
case
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
your
constitutional
beliefs
from
every
three-judge
district
court
aims
to
hand
down
a
decision
on
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
is
the
methodist
church
presumably.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
not
suggest
that
if
people
come
in
and
ask
that
some
withheld
all
their
paycheck
for
the
methodist
church
or
for
the
fraternal
order
of
elks
for
that
matter,
the
city
would
be
obliged
to
deduct
it
because
it
deducts
other
things
like
it
has
done.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
that
order
because
i
noticed
as
you
read,
as
you
read
from
it
that
you
seem
to
put
some
stress
and
perhaps
judge
mcmillan
did
too
was
so
long
as
the
defendants
continue
without
clearly
stated
in
fair
standard,
but
what
is
it
in
the
equal
protection
clause
that
requires
“clearly
stated
and
fair
standard”?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
then
that
the
city
in
deciding
perhaps
on
a
somewhat
shooting
from
the
hip
basis
what
to
check,
what
to
permit
check
off
and
what
not,
must
adopt
a
policy
that
justify
its
various
decisions
that
would
--
you
presumably
support
a
court
upholding
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
they
have
to
develop
any
standards
at
all?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
come
in
and
recite
the
history
of
what
they
have
done
and
judge
mcmillan
says
in
fact,
you
are
not
telling
the
truth.
it
is
not
what
you
say
you
have
done.
this
is
what
you
have
really
done.
he
has
got
a
right
to
measure
what
they
really
have
done
against
the
demands
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
but
i
do
not
see
anything
in
the
equal
protection
clause
that
requires
the
announcement
or
promulgation
of
standards
in
order
to
make
it
easier
or
harder
to
attack
the
thing
in
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
say
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
have
done
in
practice
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
is
totally
irrational
and
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
justifying
the
distinction.
you
do
not
say
that
until
you
promulgate
clear
standards
what
you
have
done
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
city
or
what
if
some
of
the
firemen
wanted
to
ask
their
elks
dues
to
be
checked
off
and
made
the
same
argument
your
people
do
that
anybody
in
this
town
can
join
the
elks,
and
the
city
says,
no
it
is
just
sufficiently
different
from
this
other
kind
of
things
we
are
checking
off;
we
will
not
do
it.
do
you
think
the
elks
could
come
in
and
make
the
same
claim
your
people
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
bother
you
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
two
separate
inquiries,
the
first
is
whether
the
city
is
promulgated
written
standard
or
not,
and
the
second
whether
what
it
does
in
fact
either
is
justified
by
it
on
a
rational
basis
or
whether
a
court
can
conceive
of
any
rational
basis
for
doing
it.
do
you
not
think
the
elks
case
could
be
said
put
the
one
side
what
regards
with
the
city
as
written
standards
on
the
ground
that
city
just
does
not
have
to
do
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallas
the
equal
protection
clause,
of
course,
reads
that
no
person
shall
be
denied
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
now
this
is
not
a
law,
it
is
not
a
regulation
in
fact
your
argument,
as
i
take
it,
is
almost
that
it
was
a
non-policy;
it
was
just
a
series
of
very
random
decisions
that
may
or
may
not
be
rationally
justified.
does
every
any
single
governmental
decision
of
that
sort
come
within
the
equal
protection
band?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
city
claim
that
had
an
unfettered
right
to
schedule
meetings
with
various
employee
groups
at
any
time
of
the
day
it
wanted
to,
and
that
in
variably
scheduled
meetings
with
non-union
groups,
say
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon,
and
invariably
scheduled
the
meeting
with
the
union
group
at
7:30
in
the
morning.
is
that
the
kind
of
governmental
action
that
if
you
could
show
it
was
discriminatory
and
would
invoke
the
equal
protection
clause
or
is
there
some
threshold
below
which
the
courts
just
do
not
inquire?
