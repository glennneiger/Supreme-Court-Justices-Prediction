well,
that
was
negotiated
or
part
of
the
contract
of
every
independent

the
negotiation?

e.

what
if
employee
of
fire
department
said
i
want
you
to
send
$20
out
of
each
monthly
paycheck,
ten
of
every
two
weeks
if
they
paid
that
way
to
my
church.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
decision
of
the
city,
as
the
employer,
can
establish
the
categories
with
or
without
a
good
reason
and
say
these
are
the
categories
we
will
deduct
and
we
will
check
off
none
other
than
these?
chief

e.

while
the
atkins
case
remains
on
the
books,
the
municipalities
within
the
reach
of
the
fourth

are
bound
by.
chief

e.
burger
unless
we
overrule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
even
if
there
is
only
one
union,
what
does
that
has
to
do
with
the
cityâ€™s
right
as
to
say
that
it
will
check
off
this
and
they
will
not
check
off
for
that?
chief

warren
e.

very
well

mr.
wallas
is
it
a
finding
or
just
--
it
is
not

chief

was
this
satisfied
that
the
defendants
announced
that
they
would
not
under
any
circumstances
allow
check
off
for
union
dues,
not
it
be
clear
and
explicit
but
must
it

what
is
your
basic
authority
for
that?

something.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
are
arguing
with
bond
purchases
and
insurance
premiums
you
would
have
a
much
stronger
case
on
equal
protection
as
i
see
it.
if
there
was
a
so
called
house
union,
a
company
union
unaffiliated
with
any
other
union
and
150
men
in
the
fire
department
belong
to
that
group
and
350
belong
to
this
union
of
yours
and
they
allowed
the
check
off
for
the
one
union
but
not
the
other,
then
you
might
have
an
equal
protection
case.
but
you
are
undertaking
to
compare
a
union
check
off
with
bond
purchases
and
insurance
premiums.

was
that
within
the
exception
that
the
person
presenting

was

let
us
suppose
that
was
a
general
practice
without
being
formalized
in

standards
for
the
city

allow
the
firemen
in

department
to
have
social
gatherings
of
their
social
organization
of
the
firemen
in
a
public
place.
and
then
the
union
demands
the
same
kind
of
facility
for
union
meeting.
the
city
answers
no,
we
do
not
want
to
encourage
or
help
your
union.
