mr.
william
a.
watts
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
w.a.
watts;
i
represent
the
city
of
charlotte
and
individual
petitioners
in
this
case.
we
are
here
on
the
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
that
court
has
ruled
that
a
municipality
must
grant
union
dues
check
off
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
in
the
alternative,
establish
certain
standards.
lower
courts
have
found
that
charlotte
has
not
established
clear
and
fair
standards
to
differentiate
between
the
denial
of
dues
check
off
on
the
one
hand
and
the
granting
of
six
withholdings
from
employees
pay
for
such
things
as
credit
union
savings,
insurance
premiums
and
contributions
to
one
charity,
to
name
a
few.
now
we
say
that
by
this
decision,
the
lower
courts
have
effectively
carved
out
and
established
a
substantive
right
to
dues
check
off.
we
say
that
is
a
right
that
has
never
existed
before
because
there
is
no
right
to
dues
check
off
as
we
see.
it
has
always
been
viewed
as
a
privilege
and
even
in
the
private
sector
of
our
economy,
check
off
must
generally
be
secured
by
bargaining.
nevertheless,
in
spite
of
this
the
court
has
equated
the
two
and
as
required
some
kind
of
standards.
i
think
it
might
be
important
to
the
court
to
that
i
very
briefly
recite
to
facts
giving
a
rise
to
this
case.
during
october,
1973,
local
660,
international
association
of
firefighters,
made
up
entirely
of
municipal
firemen
employees
and
five
of
their
employee
members
who
are
officers
of
the
union
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
north
carolina.
the
allegation
was
that
there
was
a
deprivation
of
rights
under
the
first
and
ninth
amendments
and
under
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
at
the
time
this
action
was
brought,
there
were
approximately
351
dues
paying
union
members
in
the
charlotte
fire
department.
this
was
out
of
a
total
of
about
543
uniformed
firemen.
the
union,
of
course,
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
the
serious
practice
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
they
claimed
also
that
denial
of
check
off
made
it
enable,
made
the
union
unable
to
obtain
group
life
insurance,
to
obtain
counsel
and
certain
other
things
that
the
union
desired
to
do.
now
on
the
other
hand,
the
city
contended
and
tried
to
show,
and
we
think
did
show,
that
the
city
had
established
not
standards,
but
a
policy,
a
policy
of
voluntary
withholding
from
employee’s
pay
and
the
city
contended
that
the
dues,
check
off
simply
did
not
conform
to
the
policy
which
the
city
had
established.
now,
i
might
mention
here
that
there
were
actually
14
items
which
the
city
permitted
to
be
withheld,
but
out
of
that
14,
seven
of
the
items
were
required
by
statute.
i
am
thinking
of
such
things
as
income
tax
withholdings
and
certain
other
things
that
either
the
federal
or
state
statutes
require
the
city
to
withhold.
that
left
seven
items
that
the
city
voluntarily
withheld
when
they
were
not
required.
one
of
these
was
a
city
sponsored
deferred
compensation
plan
that
the
city
had
established
as
a
fringe
benefit
and
indeed
we
say
all
of
the
withholdings
were
in
essence
a
fringe
benefit.
insurance
premiums
and
this
again
was
for
a
company
that
the
city
sponsored
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
city
paid
part
of
the
premiums.
the
premiums
were
--
all
it
was
accident,
health
and
also
life
insurance.
mr.
william
a.
watts
it
was
negotiated
with
a
private
insurance
company
and
the
city
participated
in
the
program
of
giving
its
employees
this
protection.
and
that,
of
course,
was
withheld
one
of
the
things
that
the
city
withheld.
us
savings
bonds
was
another.
united
way
contributions,
the
one
charity
that
was
permitted
and
that
was
available
to
all
employees.
now
in
spite
of
this
--
mr.
william
a.
watts
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we
would
say
that
all
of
these
were
available
for
all
employees
within
a
single
work
unit,
i.e.
the
fire
department.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
found
that
to
be
a
fact,
found
that
this
was
the
city’s
policy,
and
we
do
not
dispute
that;
we
think
that
it
is
a
correct
finding.
now
--
mr.
william
a.
watts
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
possible
under
the
policy
that
the
city
had
established.
the
reason
we
would
say
that
that
would
not
be
possible
or
practical
would
be
that,
we
all
know
that
there
are
many,
many
churches
and
you
would
have
to
set
up
some
kind
of
a
withholding
for
each
church,
i
assume.
so
that
would
not
conform
to
the
policy
because
as
we
all
know
that
our
fireman
belong
to
many,
many
churches,
many
religious
organizations,
many
social
organizations,
many
fraternal
organizations
and
the
sole
reason
that
the
city
had
this
policy
was
so
that
we
could
grant
or
the
city
could
grant
withholding
as
a
fringe
benefit
if
you
will,
as
a
convenience
to
its
people
but
still
keep
it
under
rationale
and,
well,
let
us
say
within
bounds.
mr.
william
a.
watts
the
only
policy
--
the
only
element
really
was
that
all
employees,
within
a
single
unit,
could
participate,
could
participate
in
a
specific
withholding.
in
other
words,
all
--
mr.
william
a.
watts
there
are
so
many
your
honor;
you
would
have
so
many
withholdings.
mr.
william
a.
watts
a
single
charity
available
to
all
the
employees,
but
churches
are
not,
you
would
have
to
note
down
how
many
churches
there
might
be
involved.
mr.
william
a.
watts
well,
now
there
again,
dues
check
off
for
one
union,
it
is
not
really
--
well,
let
us
put
it
this
way,
it
is
a
dues
type
thing.
dues
were
never
permitted
to
any
organization.
there
might
be
many
unions
involved
just
as
there
might
be
many
churches
and
we
would
say
that
would
not
conform
to
the
policy.
it
was
not
available
to
all
the
people
within
the
work
unit.
mr.
william
a.
watts
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
that
is
a
matter
of
policy
by
which
a
city
council
might
--
mr.
william
a.
watts
this
really
is
the
issue.
is
it
necessary
to
classify
in
this
situation?
now,
we
would
contend
that
it
might
be
necessary
to
classify
if
things
were
the
same,
but
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
make
to
this
court
is
simply
this.
mr.
william
a.
watts
your
honor,
i
can
only
answer
your
question
in
this
way.
if
you
will
notice
the
only
citation
at
the
district
court
or
for
that
matter
the
fourth
circuit
talked
about,
was
the
virginia
case
that
involved
segregation
and
the
impermissible
objective
of
bringing
about
or
denying
integration.
now
for
that
reason
it
would
appear
that
the
district
court
believed
that
the
city
attempted
to
discourage
the
union.
mr.
william
a.
watts
your
honor,
we
would
say
not.
we
litigated
that
case
some
time
ago
in
a
three-judge
court
and
this
was
upheld,
the
statute
was
upheld.
it
is
95-98,
i
do
not
know
lately,
yes
sir
95-98.
it
provides
in
essence
that
because
of
policy,
a
municipality
may
not
enter
in
the
collective
bargaining
contracts
with
the
union,
and
that
your
honor
was
upheld
for
what
it
is
worth
by
a
lower
court.
we
believe
that
it
is
a
permissible
type
legislation.
now
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
here,
there
is
not
one
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
city
has
ever
attempted
to
discourage
unions
other
than
the
statute
which
controls
the
city.
mr.
william
a.
watts
there
is
--
i
think
it
would
make
really
no
difference
when
you
get
right
down
to
it,
unless
the
city
would
go
so
far
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
union
to
operate.
mr.
william
a.
watts
forbid
people
belonging
to
the
union?
mr.
william
a.
watts
i
think
we
could
not
do
that
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
municipal
employees
now
have
a
right
to
belong
to
unions.
mr.
william
a.
watts
that
is
atkins
against
the
city
of
charlotte.
that
was
decided
within
the
fourth
circuit,
it
was
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
william
a.
watts
it
is
a
not
a
case
from
this
court
your
honor;
it
is
a
case
of
the
lower
court
and
i
only
mentioned
that
to
you
inciting
it
as
reason
for
my
belief
that
municipal
employees
may
belong
to
a
union.
mr.
william
a.
watts
well,
that
is
correct,
yes
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
fairly
well
established
now
that
employees,
municipal
employees
do
have
a
right
to
belong
to
unions,
but
they
have
no
right
to
dues
check
off.
that
is
the
point
i
want
to
make.
mr.
william
a.
watts
your
honor,
we
would
feel
bound
by
that
decision,
we
do
not
dispute
the
decision.
mr.
william
a.
watts
unless
your
honor,
this
court
should
overrule,
and
then
of
course,
we
would
be
bound
by
that.
but
at
the
present
time,
we
would
not
contest
the
fact
that
any
of
our
municipal
employees
may
belong
to
unions.
we
think
they
have
that
right.
we
think
they
have
a
right
to
join,
to
conduct
union
business,
to
do
everything.
but
we
think
there
is
no
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
city
to
deduct
the
dues
for
them.
mr.
william
a.
watts
oh,
i
think
that
is
right.
this
is
an
affirmative
type
thing.
we
have
no
right
to
--
we
have
no
requirement
to
do
that,
but
we
certainty
would
not
attempt
in
any
way
to
keep
the
union
from
operating,
to
keep
our
employees
from
joining,
or
to
keep
them
from
meeting
together
or
doing
anything
that
a
union
normally
does;
that
is
my
contention
your
honor.
now
going
on
just
for
a
moment
if
that
answers
your
question
right
now,
our
first
contention
here
is
that
this
case
is
really
not
an
equal
protection
case,
when
you
get
right
down
to
it.
check
off
of
union
dues
on
its
face
is
so
different
from
the
other
items
that
the
city
withheld
that
they
are
not
in
the
same
classification,
they
are
not
in
the
same
ballpark,
they
are
very,
very
different.
and
we
think
that
the
question
of
classification
is
not
raised
at
all.
mr.
william
a.
watts
we
think
not
your
honor,
but
we
think
that
clearly
in
this
case,
for
the
reasons
that
i
am
going
to
try
to
mention
to
you,
we
think
that
it
is
not
an
equal
protection
case
because
there
are
no
classifications;
that
is
our
contention.
let
us
think
for
just
a
moment
at
the
differences
between
union
dues
check
off
on
the
one
hand
and
for
instance
credit
union
savings
on
the
other.
to
begin
with,
check
off
is
for
the
benefit
of
a
union.
it
is
a
matter
of
union
security.
there
is
a
long,
long
history
of
unionism
in
the
united
states
and
the
fact
that
union
dues
check
off
is
very
important
to
the
union
as
a
matter
of
security.
it
enables
their
dues
to
be
readily
collected.
now
that
is
the
first
difference
that
i
can
think
of
and
that
is
a
very
big
difference.
another
thing,
another
difference
that
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
historically
and
practically
check
off
is
a
matter
of
the
employer-employee
relations.
that
is
another
difference,
totally
different
from
anything
else
that
the
city
has
checked
off
under
its
policy.
generally
speaking
also,
as
a
difference,
union
dues
check
off
is
a
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process;
that
is
another
difference.
it
is
also
different
in
north
carolina
cities
because
the
city
is
prohibited
by
a
state
statute
from
entering
in
the
collective
bargaining
contracts
and
we
say
--
mr.
william
a.
watts
your
honor,
i
am
just
arguing
that
it
is
not
even
a
classification
question
because
it
is
so
dissimilar.
in
other
words,
dues
check
off
is
so
dissimilar
from
anything
else
that
you
just
do
not
have
to
classify.
it
is
like
apples
and
oranges;
you
might
classify
apples
if
you
were
as
good,
bad,
or
indifferent
in
some
way,
red,
yellow,
but
you
would
not
classify
apples
and
oranges.
they
are
different
things.
that
in
and
of
itself
is
a
classification,
and
we
say
that
union
dues
check
off
is
in
a
class
by
itself.
mr.
william
a.
watts
there
is
a
policy,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
watts
that
is
correct
your
honor;
that
is
a
policy.
mr.
william
a.
watts
we
said
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
watts
that
is
right.
mr.
william
a.
watts
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
watts
that
is
what
we
said
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
watts
there
maybe
more
than
one
union
and
maybe
simply
members
of
the
firemen
who
are
not
--
mr.
william
a.
watts
we
say
that
this
is
entirely
discretionary.
it
is
a
matter
of
policy.
we
think
that
at
some
place
for
a
municipal
governing
body
must
have
a
right
to
govern.
mr.
william
a.
watts
you
do
not
really,
no
you
do
not,
your
honor.
but
we
say
it
is
there
and
we
think
that
the
court
might
be
aware
of
it,
that
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
classification
although
certainly
you
do
not
have
to
reach
it.
now
we
might
even
go
on
a
little
step
further
than
that.
we
say
that
in
any
event,
that
the
city
has
established
a
rational
basis,
quite
simply,
the
city
has
a
purpose,
a
very
valid
purpose
in
trying
to
limit
the
number
of
items
withheld,
and
that
simply
is
that
the
thing
can
become
totally
of
out
of
hand.
you
got
so
many
and
that
is
an
administrative
burden.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
watts
well,
that
is
right.
it
can
be
just
--
mr.
william
a.
watts
we
have
14
but
seven
of
those
only
seven
of
them
are
voluntary.
mr.
william
a.
watts
if
everybody
participated,
this
might
well
be
true
your
honor.
in
any
event,
we
think
that
it
is
a
certainly
a
permissible
and
a
valid
objective
that
the
city
has
to
limit,
to
permit
certain
withholdings
and
to
limit
others,
to
limit
numbers.
we
think
that
we
have
done
it
in
about
as
good
a
way
as
we
could
do
it
that
the
city
has.
now,
my
honorable
opponent
here
has
said,
well,
what
you
might
do
--
in
this
brief,
i
believe,
he
says
you
might
have
some
sort
of
a
vote
in
a
department
and
then
from
majority
of
the
people
say
that
they
want
something
withheld,
you
might
grant
that.
but
we
would
respectfully
urge
this
court
that
the
city
council
and
the
city
governing
body
is
the
one
that
has
to
determine
those
things
and
the
fact
that
there
might
be
some
other
way
of
doing
the
same
thing
of
limiting
the
number
of
withholdings;
that
does
not
make
any
difference
because
it
is
a
policy
matter
for
the
city.
we
say
that
the
council
must
be
permitted
to
govern.
i
might
mention
one
or
two
things
too.
i
would,
of
course,
hesitate
to
cite
district
court
cases
to
this
court,
however,
this
very
case
here,
a
local
660
has
been
considered
by
two
district
courts
that
i
can
think
of.
in
strazny
(ph)
against
grusauskas,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
georgia
considered
this
case
and
commented
on
it
in
the
decision.
specifically,
the
court
there,
the
district
court
declined
to
follow
local
660
for
many
of
the
reasons
that
i
have
just
enumerated
to
you.
it
was
--
this
case
was
considered
also
by
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
and
in
that
case
again,
the
district
court
refused
to
follow
the
reasoning
of
local
660
saying
among
other
things,
that
this
would
grant
a
right
to
municipal
employees
that
was
not
available
to
even
private
employees
because
private
employees
has
to
bargain
for
things.
so
for
these
reasons,
we
say
that
this
is
an
intrusion
on
the
right
of
a
city
to
govern
itself.
of
course,
you
can
--
it
is
easy
to
argue
well,
the
district
court
has
left
you
in
out.
all
you
have
to
do
is
make
out
some
kind
of
standard,
but
your
honor
what
better
standard
is
there
than
the
standard
which
the
city
has,
a
standard
which
treats
everyone
alike
under
the
constitution?
we
believe
that
the
city
council
should
be
permitted
to
govern
in
this
case.
thank
you
if
there
is
no
other
question.
mr.
william
a.
watts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
will
waive
any
rebuttal
on
any
remaining
time
that
we
have
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
