justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
the
judgment
to
announce
in
roberts
against
louisiana,
number
75-5844.
again
i
speak
for
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
powell
as
well
as
for
myself.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
of
death
for
the
crime
of
first-degree
murder
under
the
law
of
louisiana
is
constitutional.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
on
a
charge
that
he
committed
first
degree
murder
while
engaged
in
an
armed
robbery.
the
jury
found
the
petitioner
guilty
as
charged.
as
required
by
state
law,
the
trial
judge
sentenced
him
to
death.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
affirmed
the
judgment
and
we
granted
certiorari.
the
louisiana
legislature
in
1973
amended
the
state
statute
relating
to
murder
and
the
death
penalty
in
apparent
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman.
the
1973
amendments
changed
the
former
discretionary
statute
to
a
wholly
mandatory
one,
requiring
that
the
death
penalty
be
imposed
whenever
the
jury
finds
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
newly
defined
crime
of
first-degree
murder.
under
the
statute
if
there
was
a
specific
intent
to
kill
or
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm,
and
the
offender
was
engaged
in
an
armed
robbery,
the
offense
is
first-degree
murder
and
the
mandatory
punishment
is
death.
any
qualification
or
recommendation
which
a
jury
might
add
to
its
verdict,
such
as
a
recommendation
of
mercy
where
the
verdict
is
guilty
of
first-degree
murder,
is
without
any
effect.
the
constitutional
vice
of
mandatory
death
sentence
statutes,
lack
of
focus
on
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
offense
and
the
character
and
propensities
of
the
offender,
is
not
resolved
by
louisiana's
limitation
of
first-degree
murder
to
various
categories
of
killings.
the
diversity
of
circumstances
presented
in
cases
falling
within
the
single
category
of
killings
during
the
commission
of
a
specified
felony,
as
well
as
the
variety
of
possible
offenders
involved
in
such
crimes,
underscores
the
rigidity
of
louisiana's
enactment
and
its
similarity
to
the
north
carolina
statute.
louisiana's
mandatory
death
sentence
law
employs
a
procedure
that
was
rejected
by
that
state's
legislature
130
years
ago
and
that
subsequently
at
one
time
or
another
has
been
renounced
by
legislatures
and
juries
in
every
jurisdiction
in
this
nation.
the
eighth
amendment,
which
draws
much
of
its
meaning
from
"the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
mark
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society
simply
cannot
tolerate
the
reintroduction
of
a
practice
so
thoroughly
discredited.
accordingly,
for
reasons
more
fully
stated
in
the
opinion
which
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
powell
and
i
have
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
death
sentence
imposed
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case
under
louisiana's
mandatory
death
sentence
statute
violates
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
must
be
set
aside.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
filed
statements
concurring
in
the
judgment.
