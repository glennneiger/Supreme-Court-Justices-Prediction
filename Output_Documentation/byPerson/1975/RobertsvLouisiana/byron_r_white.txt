justice
byron
r.
white
the
issues
here
are
very
similar
to
those
in
woodson
against
north
carolina.
i
have
accordingly
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
this
time
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
opinion
states
at
some
length
why
we
cannot
accept
petitioner's
argument
that
capital
punishment
is
per
se
invalid,
petitioner's
further
argument
that
the
louisiana
scheme
does
not
escape
the
strictures
of
furman
v.
georgia
and
those
additional
arguments
offered
by
the
plurality,
which
were
neither
pressed
by
the
parties
nor
passed
upon
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
for
overruling
this
conviction.
as
in
the
north
carolina
case,
to
reach
the
result
it
does,
the
plurality
must
conclude
that
juries
will
not
obey
their
instructions
so
often
and
so
systematically
that
furman
v.
georgia
invalidates
the
scheme.
it
is
true
that
the
louisiana
juries
are
instructed
as
to
lesser
included
offenses
in
murder
cases.
but
they
may
consider
these
lesser
offenses
only
if
the
evidence
does
not
support
conviction
for
a
capital
offense.
this
is
the
clear
construction
of
the
statue
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
the
four
of
us
are
quite
unwilling
to
transform
the
plurality's
purely
empirical
speculation
into
a
constitutional
holding.
we
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
justice
blackmun
also
dissents
and
would
affirm
the
judgment,
for
reasons
stated
in
dissent
in
furman
v.
georgia.
