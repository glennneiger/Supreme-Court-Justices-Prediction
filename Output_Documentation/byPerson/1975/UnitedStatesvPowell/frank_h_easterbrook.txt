mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
issue
in
this
case
provides
that
pistols,
revolvers
and
other
firearms
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
are
not
mailable.
interpretive
regulations
of
the
postal
service
provide
that
the
phrase,
all
other
firearms
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
includes
what
is
not
limited
to
short
barrel
shotguns
and
riffles.
and
that
a
short
barrel
shotgun
includes
but
it
is
not
limited
to
shotguns
with
barrels
less
than
18-inches
in
length
and
an
overall
length
of
less
that
26-inches.
respondent
was
indicted
for
mailing
a
sort-of
shotgun
from
one
part
of
the
state
of
washington
to
another.
the
evidence
introduced
at
trial
demonstrated
that
a
shotgun
with
a
barrel
length
of
10-inches
and
an
overall
length
of
22-inches
sort
of
both
on
the
barrel
and
on
the
stock
was
mailed
by
respondent
to
mrs.
theresa
bailey
who
apparently
was
not
its
intended
recipient.
mrs.
bailey
turned
the
weapon
over
to
the
fbi
and
the
fbi
turned
the
evidence
over
to
the
united
states
attorney.
respondent
admitted
buying
a
shotgun
but
denied
ever
having
altered
it
or
mailing
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
this
shotgun
had
a
barrel
length
of
10-inches
and
an
overall
length
of
22-inches,
actually
22
and
1/8-inches
including
the
stock
and
the
barrel.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
well
within
the
regulations
and
in
fact
it
is
well
within
the
numerical
definitions
set
out
in
other
federal
statutes
and
in
the
washington
state
statutes
prohibits
the
possession
of
similar
sort-of
shotguns
with
barrels
less
than
12-inches
in
length.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
in
order
to
convict,
it
had
to
find
not
only
that
respondent
mailed
the
weapon
but
that
the
weapon
was
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person.
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
statute
is
vague
as
to
all
weapons
that
were
designed
as
shoulder
weapons.
apparently
no
matter
how
small
or
readily
concealable
the
weapon
maybe
or
whether
it
was
so
altered
that
it
is
no
longer
capable
of
being
used
as
a
shoulder
weapon.
the
court
held
that
the
phrase
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
is
so
uncertain
in
scope
and
application
that
it
cannot
constitutionally
be
used
by
congress
and
the
congress
should
instead
have
used
numerical
definitions
as
it
has
done
in
other
statutes.
the
court
did
not
refer
the
postal
service
regulation
and
the
court
made
no
attempts
to
clarify
or
construe
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
alleviate
the
vagueness.
the
only
issue
before
the
court
therefore
is
whether
the
phrase
other
firearms
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
is
so
devoid
if
meaning
that
it
cannot
be
used
to
support
punishment
even
if
the
particular
shotgun
is,
as
the
jury
found
in
this
case,
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person,
and
even
if
there
is
an
entire
class
of
weapons
clearly
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person,
our
point
of
departure
is
the
general
principle.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no.
the
court
never
did
your
honor.
it
said
as
to
all
weapons
that
were
designed
as
shoulder
weapons
on
its
face
and
it
never
reached
to
--
supplied
to
this
person.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
issue
is
still
open
and
it
will
be
open
on
remand.
it
seems
to
us
quite
possible
that
a
sort-of
shotgun
of
an
overall
length
of
16-inches
is
clearly
within
the
statute.
a
sort-of
shotgun
with
an
overall
length
of
32-inches
might
or
might
not
be
within
the
statute
and
there
would
be
a
vagueness
as
applied
argument
as
to
such
a
shotgun.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
there
are
at
least
some
sort-of
shotguns
plainly
within
that
statute
and
—
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
you
agreed
as
to
the
argument
as
to
all
sort-of
shotguns
then
it
would
not
be
open
on
remand.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
we
proved
as
part
of
our
case
in
this
case
that
this
particular
weapon
—
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
we
would
and
that
would
be
an
issue
–
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
and
that
issue
went
to
the
jury
in
this
case
and
the
jury
was
satisfied
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
conflict
on
the
evidence.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
one
federal
agent
testified
that
the
weapon
was
bulky
enough
that
it
might
cause
a
bulge
and
might
cause
a
bulge
under
the
clothing
if
it
is
attempted
to
be
concealed
under
the
clothing
and
i
think
that
created
a
fair
issue
for
the
jury
whether
that
bulge
was
so
observable
that
the
weapon
was
not
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
in
a
realistic
sense.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
statute
did
not
define
the
term
'person'
mr.
justice
marshall.
on
the
other
hand
i
think
the
statute
gives
several
clues
that
would
enable
someone
who
attempts
to
comply
with
the
statute
to
understand
the
statute's
meaning.
perhaps
the
most
important
clue
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
provides
that
it
applies
to
weapons
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person.
that
would
presumably
mean
a
person
who
was
determined
to
conceal
it
and
was
wearing
whatever
clothing
was
necessary
to
conceal
it.
more
over
it
seems
reasonable
that
it
would
include
at
least
a
person
of
average
size
and
perhaps
a
person
who
could
be
chosen
for
concealing
the
weapon.
that
is
a
fairly
large
person.
pardon?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
term
person
is
one
that
applies
to
people
of
different
sizes
and
i
think
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
to
make
that
go
away.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
as
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
it
might
well
make
a
difference.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
so
when
worn
under
a
jacket—
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
so.
and
the
same
argument
about
the
size
of
the
person
is
remarkable
with
weapons
no
matter
how
small
those
weapons
maybe.
for
example,
a
very
slight
person
wearing
tight
fitting
clothing
could
not
conceal
the
pistol,
no
matter
how
small
that
pistol
might
be.
it
would
always
have
a
tell-tale
bulge.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
so
your
honor
and
there
was—
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
was
testimony
in
this
case
that
the
place
in
which
this
shotgun
could
be
usefully
concealed
is
under
a
pants
leg.
and
since
both
men
and
women
wear
pants,
presuming
that
includes
respondent’s
pants
like.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
our
position
is
that
the
concept
of
vague
on
its
face
simply
has
no
meaning
outside
the
first
amendment
area.
and
that
the
argument,
someone
has
to
make
use
of
this
the
statute
did
not
give
him
notice
that
his
particular
conduct
was
within
the
statute's
prescription.
to
the
extent
it
has
any
meaning
at
all,
it
is
a
very
delicate
argument
that
there
is
no
meaning
in
the
statute.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
right
as
applied
to
statutes
other
than
first
amendment
statutes.
to
the
extent
the
concept
of
vague
on
its
face
has
any
meaning.
it
is
a
very
peculiar
kind
of
meaning.
it
is
an
argument
that
the
statutes
words
are
so
uncertain
that
no
one
has
any
idea
whatever,
whether
his
conduct
is
within
the
ambient
of
the
the
statute,
whether
there
is
a
zone
of
uncertainty
around
the
statute,
whether
he
could
comply
with
the
statute
if
he
attempted
to
comply.
that
is
an
exceptionally
narrow
class
of
cases
and
we
submit
it
is
a
very
far
cry
from
the
situation
here
because
the
statute
refers
to
a
number
of
things
that
people
might
be
able
to
judge,
if
they
were
to
look
at
the
statute
and
attempt
to
comply.
concealability
depends
on
a
number
of
factors
within
the
experience
of
most
people.
shorter
weapons
can
be
more
readily
concealed
than
longer
ones.
slim
weapons
are
more
readily
concealed
than
bulky
ones.
light
ones
are
more
readily
concealed
that
heavy
ones.
each
weapon
possesses
some
combination
of
these
characteristics
and
when
taken
in
combination
they
establish
its
concealability
or
the
lack
of
its
concealability.
people
of
common
understanding
acknowledge
that
a
short
light
single-barreled
weapon
sort
of
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
is
capable
of
being
concealed
on
most
if
not
all
people.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
is
why
there
is
significant
certainty
in
the
statute
provided
by
the
term
capable
of
being
concealed.
it
refers
to
the
concealability
of
the
weapon
and
not
to
what
an
average
person
maybe
wearing
on
the
street
at
a
particular
moment.
it
directs
the
attention
of
the
person
who
desires
to
comply
with
the
statute.
to
the
ability
of
the
weapon
to
be
concealed
by
some
person
determined
to
conceal
it.
to
utilize
the
capability
of
the
sort-of
shotgun
to
be
concealed
and
indeed,
common
experience
goes
perhaps
a
little
further
than
that.
and
suggest
that
the
only
reason
for
sawing
off
the
barrels
and
stock
of
a
shoulder
weapon
is
to
permit
its
concealment
on
the
person.
then
too
the
standard
under
this
statute
is
an
objective
standard.
all
of
the
factors
we
have
suggested,
the
length
of
the
weapon,
the
weight
of
the
weapon,
the
bulkiness
of
the
weapon
depend
on
verifiable
objective
factors
pertaining
to
the
weapon.
the
statutes
with
which
this
court
has
been
concerned
and
has
struck
down
for
vagueness
depend
on
subjective
standards,
such
as
the
degree
of
annoyance
caused
by
standard
by
conduct
or
the
amount
of
harmed
competitors
caused
by
particular
conduct.
on
the
statutes
meaning
turns
upon
the
effect
of
the
conduct
on
third
parties.
it
is
often
hard
for
someone
even
one
who
seeks
to
comply
to
assess
that
conduct
in
advance.
he
cannot
know
the
ripples
that
his
conduct
will
propagate
among
other
people.
not
so
here,
the
standard
is
objective,
physical
and
turns
on
an
analysis
of
the
gun
itself.
not
on
an
analysis
of
what
the
gun
will
do
to
other
people
or
how
they
will
react
to
it.
in
fact,
as
i
have
suggested
before,
perhaps
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
all
sort-of
shotguns
are
within
its
scope.
and
as
mr.
justice
white
stated
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
on
that
submission
then
there
is
no
problem
of
vagueness
as
applied
or
a
vagueness
on
its
face.
we
acknowledge
as
i
have
acknowledged
before
that
there
are
words
in
the
statute
that
include
a
potential
for
uncertain
application.
the
word
'person'
is
not
definite,
there
is
no
reference
man.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
was
enough
to
strike
the
statute
down.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct
and
it
is
also
an
issue
not
only
for
the
jury
but
for
the
court
through
a
process
of
continued
adjudication.
courts
can
hold
after
a
number
of
cases
that
coca
cola
bottles
are
inside
or
outside
the
statute’s
scope
and
those
adjudications
will
give
notice
to
those
who
seeks
to
comply
with
the
statute
as
to
the
statute's
meaning.
and
so
here
this
statute
as
well
can
be
construed
by
a
court
to
eliminate
most
if
not
all
of
the
problem
of
vagueness.
that
is
if
this
court
or
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
announced
that
sort-of
shotguns
are
so
readily
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
that
they
are
within
the
statutes
ambient.
the
problem
of
vagueness
is
by
and
large
cured
through
judicial
construction
and
there
is
no
need
to
strike
the
statute
down.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
court
were
to
say
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
sort-of
shotguns
are
by
and
large
within
the
ambient
of
the
statute,
there
is
still
a
question
for
the
jury
in
every
case
whether
this
sort-of
shotgun
was
in
fact
concealable
and
that
is
the
question.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
it
goes
to
the
jury
in
every
case.
we
need
it
to
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that
is
correct
and
as
i
indicated,
mr.
justice
marshall
we
think
there
is
a
question
for
the
jury
in
every
single
case.
the
only
point
of
my
argument
was
that
the
problem
of
vagueness
can
by
and
large
be
eliminated.
that
is
if
the
court
announces
that
the
statute
includes
sort-of
shotguns
to
the
extent
they
are
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
think
it
has
and
that
is
why—
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
respondent
claims
that
what
was
clear
to
congress
and
what
is
clear
to
us
was
not
clear
to
her.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
we
think
that
can
be
cleared
up
with
some
ease
actually.
having
set
out
the
skeleton
of
our
position,
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
number
of
arguments
that
respondents
make
that
border
on
vagueness
arguments
but
that
we
submit
on
vagueness
arguments.
the
first
of
these,
we
have
touched
on
earlier.
and
that
is
the
argument
that
the
shotgun
in
this
case
had
a
bulky
stock
would
have
caused
a
bulge
under
someone’s
coat
and
therefore
was
not
in
fact
conceivable.
that
argument
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
rejected
it.
it
is,
we
submit
it,
not
a
vagueness
argument
at
all
but
simply
a
question
of
fact
to
be
adjudicated
on
the
the
statute.
second
argument
is
the
argument
that
the
statute
could
have
been
drawn
with
greater
precision.
and
therefore
should
have
been
drawn
with
greater
precision.
this
we
think
is
an
argument
about
legislative
policy,
the
constitutional
question
is
simply
whether
the
words
congress
used
are
devoid
of
meaning.
if
congress
uses
words
of
clear
purport
in
at
least
some
cases,
the
fact
that
they
could
have
been
clearer
still
is
immaterial
for
constitutional
purposes.
third,
respondent
argues
that
there
is
some
murky
zone
between
large
and
therefore
mailable
sort-of
shotguns
and
small
and
therefore
non-mailable
sort-of
shotguns.
and
that
respondent
could
not
tell
where
in
the
zone
of
uncertainty
her
conduct
fell.
this
is
again
not
a
vagueness
argument
by
and
large
but
an
argument
for
the
jury.
to
the
extent
it
is
a
vagueness
argument
at
all
it
is
an
argument
about
vagueness
as
applied
to
particular
weapons,
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
some
sort-of
shotguns
that
are
so
large
that
even
though
the
jury
concludes
ultimately
that
they
are
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person.
that
it
was
so
uncertain
cannot
be
properly
culpable
for
her
conduct.
now
this
court
has
indicated
that
in
most
ordinary
criminal
statues.
a
person
who
approaches
the
zone
of
uncertainty,
simply
takes
the
risk,
that
he
will
cross
the
line.
that
we
submit
is
the
proper
resolution
of
the
a
vagueness
as
applied
issue
in
this
case.
respondent
approached
the
zone
of
uncertainty
and
took
the
risk
that
she
would
cross
the
line.
however,
it
is
not
altogether
necessary
to
reach
that
question
in
order
to
decide
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
yet
addressed
that
argument.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
are
statutes
making
un-mailable
destructive
devices
and
explosives
fall
into
the
category
of
destructive
devices.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that
is
still
possible
your
honor.
the
final
argument
the
respondent
has
raised
is
because
the
statute
does
not
specifically
mention
sort-of
shotguns,
it
does
not
reach
them,
it
is
too
vague
because
of
the
term
other
firearms.
whether
other
firearms
is
too
vague
is
another
question,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach.
the
problem
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
this
statute
is
whether
the
phrase
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
is
too
vague.
the
vagueness
problem
discerned
by
the
court
of
appeals
will
exist
in
this
case
even
if
the
statute
said
that
pistols,
revolvers,
shotguns
and
other
firearms
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
shall
be
non
mailable
because
respondents
still
could
contend
that
her
shotgun
was
not
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
that
the
statute
was
vague
as
to
her.
we
think
therefore
that
the
argument
that
the
statute
does
not
specifically
mention
shotguns
is
simply
not
a
vagueness
argument
within
the
posture
of
this
case.
in
some,
the
only
problem
with
the
statute
is
whether
the
phrase
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
is
so
devoid
of
meaning
that
it
cannot
ever
carry
with
it
a
criminal
punishment.
we
think
that
it
can
and
that
it
can
be
construed
to
be
even
clearer
by
this
court,
especially
perhaps
by
reference
to
the
postal
service
regulations
which
have
made
it
about
as
clear
as
can
be.
we
think
this
case
is
governed
by
what
the
court
wrote
two
terms
ago
in
the
letter
carriers.
there
are
limitations
in
the
english
language
with
respect
to
being
both
specific
and
manageably
brief.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
although
the
prohibitions
may
not
satisfy
those
intent
upon
finding
fault
at
any
cost,
they
are
settled
in
terms
that
ordinary
person
exercising
ordinary
common
sense,
and
sufficiently
understand
and
comply
with.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
believe
that
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
believe
that
it
does.
i
may
be
incorrect
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
has
been
used
very
seldom,
most
shipments
of
firearms
of
this
sort
cross
state
boundaries
and
so
other
statutes
are
available
for
prosecution.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
was
the
reason
the
united
states
attorney
selected
the
statute
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
as
far
as
we
know,
it
is
the
only
reason
why
this
one
was
selected.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
have
nothing
further
your
honor.
