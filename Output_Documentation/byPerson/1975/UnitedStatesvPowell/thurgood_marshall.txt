mr.
easterbrook,
the
word
person
is
that
a
five
foot
or
seven
foot,
500
pound
or
200
pound
or
100
pound
person.
that
is
the
one
that
gets
me
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
a
trouble
with
all
sort-of
shotgun
beyond
all
the
same
length,
i
have
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
cut
off
one-inch
you
could
not
conceal
it
for
well,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
this
include
all
shotguns?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
this
include
all
shotgun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
take
that
then
you
are
not
talking
about
a
shotgun.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
becomes
the
jury
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
tell
the
jury
that
this
gun
can
be
concealed
on
a
person,
what
was
the
expertise
of
the
expert?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
you
have
a
clothing
man
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
who
is
the
expert
on
what
you
can
conceal
in
clothing?
the
average
person,
that
is
all.
there
is
no
expertise
in
that
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
example,
an
expert
says
almost
all
firearms
can
be,
do
you
want
to
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
all
firearms?
i
hope
he
did
not.
i
hope
he
did
not
put
a
bazooka
on
somebodyâ€˜s
clothes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
final
question
did
the
judge
instructed
jury
on
the
expert?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
not
somebody
object
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
sort-of
shotguns
given
to
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
eight
inch
shotgun
would
be
a
shoulder
type
weapon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible),
how
does
he
shoot?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
point
is
that
the
weapon
can
be
concealed,
that
is
the
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
cannot
ignore
that
point.
you
cannot
just
say
all
shotguns
are
outside
of
the
statute,
i
hope
you
are
not
saying
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
that
this
shotgun
is
outside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
not
what
the
court
ruled.
the
court
said
all
of
them
were.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
a
22-inch
quite
in
length
and
bulky.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
applies
--
that
court's
opinion
applies
to
all
22.8-inch
sort-of
shotguns
that
are
bulky.
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
you
tell
me
what
bulky
is?
i
mean
so
i
can
measure
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
width?
how
much
width,
because
it
is
horrible
word?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
got
any
proof
that
a
sort-of
shotgun
can
be
fired
with
one
hand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
can
fire
with
one
hand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right
but
it
can
be
fired
with
one
hand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
makes
it
a
handgun.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
between
a
handgun
and
a
shoulder
gun,
that
is
the
basic
difference
and
a
sort-of
shotgun,
once
it
is
sort
of
is
not
a
typical
shoulder
gun.
