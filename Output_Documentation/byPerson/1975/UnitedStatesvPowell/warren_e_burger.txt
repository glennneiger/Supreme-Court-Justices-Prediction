chief
justice

burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
powell,
74-884.
mr.
easterbrook
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
matter
of
this
bulge,
i
suppose
a
snub-nose
38
caliber
pistol
commonly
worn
by
police
officers
often
in
fact
creates
a
bulge
that
is
noticeable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
clearly
that
would
be
subject
to
the
statute,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
listen
if
you
took
the
four-ten
gauge
shotgun
and
cut
it
down
to
8-inches
and
cut
the
stock
down
to
a
pistol
grip
which
has
been
done,
you
could
conceal
it
by
strapping
it
on
your
leg,
could
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
wear
a
tight
pants.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
are
outside
of
the
first
amendment,
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
difference
between
vague
as
applied
and
vague
on
its
face?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
especially
if
they
are
bent
on
concealing
it
they
will
wear
clothing
that
will
facilitate
the
concealment,
is
that
not
the
reason
of
my
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
is
any
more
or
less
vague
than
the
term
used
in
many
statutes,
dangerous
weapon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
presents
an
issue
for
a
jury
to
decide
whether
as
in
one
case
did,
a
coca
cola
bottle
is
a
dangerous
weapon.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
moberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
is
that
not
a
holding
that
has
applied
to
other
firearms
i.e.
shotguns
it
is
void
on
its
face.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
a
reasonable
man
have
very
much
difficulty
in
concluding
that
this
gun,
this
particular
gun
could
be
concealed
under
a
heavy
over
coat?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
taking
the
extreme
case,
heavy
over
coat
or
very
loose
baggy
pants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
judge
by
submitting
in
the
jury
obviously
made
the
decision
that
a
reasonable
man
could
so
conclude,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
question
went
to
really
telling
us
that
a
reasonable
man
could
not
reasonably
conclude
that
this
could
be
concealed
in
some
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
knew
this
was
not
a
pistol
and
he
knew
it
was
not
a
revolver;
therefore
it
was
an
other
weapon,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
juriesâ€™
assessment
of
her
credibility,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
have
any
further
mr.
easterbrook?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
very
much
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
the
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in
74-884,
united
states
against
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
mr.
justice
powell.
