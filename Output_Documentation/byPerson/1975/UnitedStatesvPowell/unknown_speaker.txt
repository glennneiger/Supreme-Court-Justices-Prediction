unknown
speaker
what
are
the
dimensions
of
this
shotgun?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
well
within
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
order
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
issue
is
still
open
--.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
by
saying
it
is
a
sort-of
shotgun.
unknown
speaker
if
you
made
that
argument
and
we
agreed
with
you,
the
issue
would
not
be
over.
unknown
speaker
would
not
that
be
a
matter
of
fact,
would
you
have
to
prove
that
as
part
of
your
case
if
you
came
in
there
with
that
20-inch
barrel?
unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail
on
this
vagueness
and
if
you
prevail
in
asking
us
to
reverse
the
judgment
on
this
case,
you
would
nonetheless
have
--
would
you
not
have
a
burden
proof
in
an
ordinary
prosecution
of
proving
that
this
weapon
is
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person.
unknown
speaker
the
jury
satisfaction
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
on
that
issue
was
to
the
effect
that
this
weapon
was
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person.
so
there
is
no
conflict
on
as
to
that,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
will
ask
you,
are
there
other
statutes
making
un-mailable
various
other
kinds
of
firearms
and
explosives
and
so
on?
unknown
speaker
and
do
they
too
make
it
a
criminal
offense
to
mail?
unknown
speaker
such
devices.
in
other
words
this
respondent
have
been
charged
under
those
other
statutes,
is
there
any
problem?
and
if
we
decide
this
case
against
you,
all
those
other
statutes
would
be
available.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
i
have
got
a
couple
of
it,
inconsequential
questions
that
does
this
record
show
the
offense
for
which
mr.
bailey
was
confined?
unknown
speaker
does
it
show
the
offense
for
which
mr.
powell
was
confined?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
my
impression,
this
statute
has
been
very
seldom
used.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
reason
it
was
utilized
here?
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
reason
as
far
as
you
know?
unknown
speaker
mr.
moberg,
did
not
--
i
am
looking
at
page
3a
of
the
government’s
petition
of
certiorari
where
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
set
up.
did
not
the
court
of
appeals
extend
its
invalidation
to
the
term
other
firearms
and
not
just
to
shot
sort-of
shotguns?
unknown
speaker
but
what
they
said
on
3a
was
this,
having
decided
the
unconstitutional
vagueness
of
the
statute
as
it
is
applied
to
“other
firearms”.
we
need
not
reach
the
other
assignments
here
made
by
appellant.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
look
at
the
paragraph
above
the
paragraph
i
was
just
reading
from
page
3a
on
the
petition,
was
that
to
require
congress
to
delimit
the
size
of
the
firearms
other
than
pistols
and
revolvers.
that
sounds
like
they
are
focusing
on
that
clause
in
general.
unknown
speaker
no,
would
you
need
an
expert
testimony
in
a
case
like
this?
why
is
it
not
some
of
the
jury
is
as
good
a
judge
representing
an
expert?
unknown
speaker
how
was
that
ordinarily
determined,
it
is
determined
by
a
ruling
of
the
trial
judge,
is
it
not
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
not
by
some
expert
getting
up
and
testifying.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
right
now
they
are
just
vacating
the
judgment
below
and
sending
it
back
to
place
the
statutory
question
at
the
outset?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
use
of
sort-of
shotguns?
unknown
speaker
when
you
get
out
into
the
field,
what
use
is
made
of
it?
unknown
speaker
what
do
people
use
them
for
as
a
result
of
that
less
restricted
choke?
unknown
speaker
they
are
used
to
shoot
people
with
that.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
the
only
use
for
it?
unknown
speaker
you
know
any
other
use
for?
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
ever
pick
a
shotgun
with
a
ten
inch
barrel
as
opposed
to
a
shotgun
with
a
two
and
a
half
foot
barrel
to
shoot
birds
with?
unknown
speaker
if
you
get
the
bird
out
at
two
feet
from
here
you
can
use
the
sort-of
shotgun.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
moberg,
a
couple
of
questions
just
leaving
through
the
record,
did
mrs.
powell
persist
in
denying
that
she
ever
mailed
this?
unknown
speaker
and
am
i
correct
in
my
impression
that
she
said
she
purchased
it
for
her
self-protection
at
home?
unknown
speaker
well
then
is
it
as
to
the
other
one
that
she
conceded
she
never
resembled?
unknown
speaker
well
is
it
not
there
is
a
testimony
in
her
part
that
she
put
up
in
a
closet
and
never
assembled
it?
unknown
speaker
and
why
would
she
not
if
purchased
a
shotgun
for
self
protection?
unknown
speaker
so
she
bought
it
for
her
protection
but
she
did
not
do
what
was
necessary
for
her
protection.
unknown
speaker
let
us
just
assume
that
someone
disagrees
with
you
and
holds
that
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear
insofar
a
sort-of
shotgun
and
just
as
clear
as
it
is
with
pistols.
now
you
do
not
agree
with
that,
but
let
us
assume
that
someone
decides
that
that
is
the
way
it
is.
on
that
assumption
there
is
no
discretion
at
all
and
the
prosecutor
except
just
do
not
bring
a
case
but
that
is
not
true
of
any
statute.
for
me
it
is
certainly
would
not
--
giving
in
many
range
of
discretion,
it
would
not
have
under
criminal
statute.
if
it
is
clear
that
the
statute
covers
this
weapon.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
moberg
before
you
sit
down,
assume
for
the
moment
as
painful
as
it
maybe
that
this
court
possibly
may
decide
against
you
on
both
the
constitutional
and
statutory
issues,
would
any
issue
or
fact
remand
for
the
jury
to
decide
on
a
remand
and
if
so
why?
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
decide
the
case
against
you,
just
assume
it.
and
the
case
were
remanded,
what
issues
of
fact
would
remand.
there
was
a
jury
of
verdict
against
you
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
and
instruction
no.
8
laid
out
the
statute
barbatum
so
that
the
jury
found
that
this
weapon
could
be
concealed
on
the
person.
so
would
there
be
any
of
issue
of
fact
left
in
the
case
--
unknown
speaker
yes
but
if
this
court
reverses
that
it
reinstates
the
conviction
entered
already
entered,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
there
is
nothing
more
if
we
reversed
that
is
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
to
get
a
new
trial
you
will
be
on
some
issue
not
yet
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals.
