of
course,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
really
what
congress
intended,
you
go
back
to
justice
holmes
holding
that
would
be
in
all
case
a
negligence
in
the
1920â€™s
that,
you
know
the
courts
have
to
lay
down
standards
of
what
is
or
what
is
not
negligence
and
if
you
do
not
stop
at
the
rail
road
crossing
it
is
negligence
per
se,
well
that
was
largely
rejected
by
cases
that
came
after
that.
it
seems
to
me
here
congress
intended
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
under
the
congressional
definition.
i
do
not
really
think
they
intended
that
courts
were
to
define
classes
in
or
out
of
the
definition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
not
the
congress
announced
that
already?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
added
by
the
court
doing
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
maybe
why
we
have
granted
certiorari.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
an
other
firearm.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
statutory,
not
a
constitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
go
on
that
ground.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
not
kind
of
strange
that
they
did
not
reach
the
construction
argument
because
they
went
right
to
the
constitutional
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
eastern
district
of
washington
where
the
respondent,
one
josephine
powell,
was
convicted
of
mailing
a
firearm
capable
of
being
concealed
on
the
person
to
with
a
sawed-off
shotgun
in
violation
of
title
18
united
states
code,
section
1715.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
her
conviction
on
the
ground
that
this
act
of
congress
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
the
statute
of
congress
was
not
unconstitutionally
vague
and
we,
therefore,
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
should
have
said
that.
