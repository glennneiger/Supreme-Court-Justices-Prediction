mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think,
excuse
me,
i
think
initially
that
it
needs
to
be
some
remarks
addressed
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
respondent
is
making
a
facial
attack,
i
believe
then
the
position
of
respondent,
both
at
the
trial
court
and
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
that
statute
was
vague
as
applied
to
her.
and
i
believe
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
opinion
if
the
ninth
circuit,
a
per
curiam
opinion
and
therefore
by
definition
being
rather
short,
does
although
not
very
precisely
set
forth
that
this
statute
is
vague
as
it
applies
to
sort-of
shotguns
and
i
believe
that
a
fair
reading
can
include
in
that,
as
it
applies
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
and
that
therefore
the
attack
in
the
question
before
this
court
is
not,
whether
this
is
in
fact
a
facial
attack
of
a
non-first
amendment
statute
but
in
fact
whether
or
not
this
statute,
criminal
statute
as
applied
to
the
respondent
is
unduly
vague
and
i
think
that
--
as
applies
to
shotguns
of
the
kind
and
i
believe
that
the
only
record
was
that
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
believe
it
depends
on
the
court
of
appeals
since
it
only
had
the
evidence
of
one
shotgun
of
a
specific
dimension
was
referring
then
to
that
shotgun.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
no.
i
would
say
to
the
shotgun
of
that
dimension.
i
believe
that
is
the
only
record
that
the
court
had
and
i
do
not
believe
then
that
the
court
could—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
a
specific
shotgun
which
was
the—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
that
becomes
a
question
then,
it
becomes
a
jury
question
if
properly
submitted
to
the
jury.
if
the
statute
then
is
of
such
certainty
that
sort-of
shotguns
would
fall
within
the
ambient
of
that
statute,
it
is
of
respondent’s
position
that
the
statute
as
applied
is
not
of
such
certainty
that
it
would
include
shotguns
and
therefore
make
a
jury
question.
and
it
was
moved
at
the
trial
court
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
shotgun
was
not
a
concealable
weapon,
otherwise
we
get
into
i
belief
the
question
that
this
court
has
expressed
some
concern
with
this
whether
or
not
we
can
make
a
statute
become
a
jury
question
and
whether
or
not
the
estimation
of
the
jury
will
the
deciding
factor
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
believe
that
there
is
language
in
that
that
could
support
in
a
very
narrow
reading
that
it
would
apply
to
other
firearms.
i
think
that
in
the
–
and
unfortunately
because
it
is
a
per
curiam
opinion
that
the
other
language
in
the
opinion
referring
to
sort-of
shotguns
saying
that
this
case
at
least
has
applied
to
sort-of
shotguns
is
a
case
where
the
vagueness
challenge
has
been
supported
that
the
court
was
meaning
to
say
that
considering
the
record
before
the
court
on
appeal
in
the
manner
which
the
issue
was
presented
on
appeal
that
as
applied
to
this
shotgun,
the
statute
was
vague
and
that
it
did
not
include
in
his
prescription
the
mailing
of
this
weapon.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
and
i
think
that
they
are
referring
to
other
firearms
in
reference
to
sort-of
shotguns.
that
is
as
opposed
to
other
firearms
in
reference
to
capability
of
concealment.
i
think
the
language
is
unfortunately
not
precise
but
i
think
that
the
reading
fairly
of
the
opinion
is
that
as
to
the
other
firearms
restriction
as
applied
to
sort-of
shotguns
because
the
court
at
one
point
in
the
opinion
did
indicate
parenthetically
that
their
comments
were
as
applied
to
the
sort-of
shotguns.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
it
would
be
my
reading
of
the
opinion
that
is
not
that
broad
of
a
holding
or
that
the
court
was
referring
then
principally
to
the
sort-of
shotgun
as
being
an
other
firearm
and
on
that
basis
it
was
vague
and
then
i
think
in
--
rather
dicta
in
this
opinion
said
that
this
firearm
provision
could
be
rather
more
precisely
drawn
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
necessary
to
the
resolution
of
the
case
as
applied
to
the
appellant
at
that
point,
the
respondent
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
at
any
point
that
most
properly
then
we
have
a
question
in
terms
of
an
application
of
the
statute
to
a
sort-of
shotgun
that
has
been
described
as
22
and
1/8-inches
in
length,
ten-inch
barrel
and
rather
bulky.
i
think
particularly
in
the
testimony
provided
by
the
state,
that
there
was
some
testimony
by
the
expert
that,
yes
this
weapon
could
be
concealed
in
a
full
coat
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
riffle,
a
full
size
shotgun
could
be
concealed
on
a
full
coat
and
that
most
any
weapon
could
be
concealed
on
the
person
should
someone
want
to
conceal
it.
so
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
testimony
was
of
such
an
expert
opinion
that
this
was
a
concealable
item
and
i
think
that
the
testimony
was
that
that
almost
any
weapon
is
capable
of
concealment
on
the
person
which
i
think
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
i
would
answer
the
first
part
of
that
question
that,
no
you
would
not
need
an
expert
in
regards
to
the
testimony.
if
in
fact
it
was
properly
an
issue
before
the
jury,
that
is
if
in
fact
it
had
been
determined
that
this
item
was
within
the
ambient
of
the
statute
and
therefore
it
became
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct.
except
that
i
think
that
the
ruling
of
the
trial
judge
in
terms
of
whether
there
is
evidence
or
whether
or
not
this
weapon
is
within
the
ambient
of
the
statute
could
be
premised
partially
upon
expert
testimony
as
to
the
concealability
of
the
weapon.
in
other
words
i
think
the
trial
judge
could
call
upon
that
expertise
in
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
he
was
a
tobacco
and
firearms
agent
of—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
[laughter]
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
it
is
not
a
question
that
is
exclusively
within
expert
testimony
but
that
expert
testimony
does
not
make
it
any
more
or
less
difficult
determination.
i
am
not
saying
that
there
needs
to
be
expert
testimony.
i
am
saying
that
there
needs
to
be
the
determination
that
the
statute,
that
the
charge
regarding
this
weapon
would
fall
within
the
statute.
i
think
curiously
enough
that
the
government
has
not
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
what
he
said.
he
said
that
a
full
length
shotgun
can
be
concealed.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
believe
that
he
said
the
literal
context
of
the
appendix
was
that
he
said
that
almost
any
firearm
could
be
concealed
and
i
think
the
importer’s
remarks
was
that,
it
does
not
take
a
great
deal
of
a
problem
to
conceal.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
yes,
it
was
an
instruction
on
expert
testimony
presented.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
at
that
point
through
the
trial,
we
were
raising
the
objection
that
it
was
not
a
jury
question
at
all
and
therefore
not
even
properly
subject
to
expert
testimony.
that
clearly,
that
statute
did
not
apply
to
sort-of
shotguns
and
therefore
it
was
not
an
element
of
the
crime
and
that
it
was
not
a
jury
question.
i
think
that
in
reference
to
the
vagueness
argument
that
we
need
to
be
premised
on
--
operate
on
a
couple
of
premises.
i
think
that
that
first
of
all
we
need
to
consider
the
statute
and
whether
or
not
it
does
fairly
appraise
one—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
eight-inches
in
entire
length.
i
would
say
that
not
clearly
it
would
because
it
is
a
sort-of
shotgun
and
in
terms
of
that,
it
is
a
shoulder
type
weapon
that
it
would
not
clearly
come
under
the
statute
but
that
a
stronger
argument
could
be
made.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
it
is
a
shoulder
class
of
weapon.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
i
think
that
the
testimony
was
in
fact
that
if
you
have
a
sort-of
shotgun
that
you
need
to
shoot
it
from
the
shoulder
or
from
the
hip
and
as
distinguished
from
a
pistol
because
of
the
certain
recoil
characteristics
of
the
sort-of
shotgun.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
the
statute
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
i
am
not
saying
that
in
terms
of
this
case,
except
that
the
government
would
have
a
stronger
position
to
urge
in
regards
to
sort-of
shotguns
of
that
dimension.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
yes.
i
am
saying
that,
this
shotgun,
this
20—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
it
gets
back
to
them.
i
guess
their
interpretation
of
that
courts
opinion
because
the
court
did
say
that
--
and
had
only
reference
to
this
size
of
a
shotgun
and
there
was
no
evidence
set
that
a
smaller
sort-of
shotgun
could
or
does
exist.
so
that
i
do
not
believe
that
a
broad
reading
of
that
per
curiam
opinion
would
be
fair
in
terms
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
okay,
bulky
in
terms
of
size,
in
terms
of
width,
weight-
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
believe
at
that
point
there
was—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
the
question
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
or
not
the
statute
as
it
was
written
would
apply
to
the
respondent
in
that
particular
case
and
the
shotgun
that
the
respondent
had,
that
is
correct.
and
it
was
very
in
the
briefs,
the
shotgun
was
described
in
terms
of
its
length
and
its
width.
and
arguing
that
that
it
is
not
a
weapon
capable
of
concealment
and
also
that
the
statute
is
not
of
such
a
precise
language
to
include
that
class
of
sort-of
shotguns,
that
class
of
weapons
of
that
size
and
bulk.
and
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
issue.
i
think
that
this
statute
does
not
provide
the
sufficient
amount
of
notice
to
appraise
someone
that
if
you
mail
in
the
mails
a
sort-of
shotgun
that
is
of
22
and
an
eight-inch
length
and
is
imprecisely
has
it
been
test
by
to
its
bulky
that
you
fall
within
the
prescription
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
if
we
operate
on
the
premise
at
number
one
as
a
criminal
statute,
the
statue
needs
to
be
strictly
construed.
and
number
2,
that
under
the
connally
case
that
it
has
to
be
a
statute
drawn
to
such
precision,
the
man
of
common
intelligence
could
decide
that
clearly
that
this
weapon
is
within
the
ambient
of
the
statute.
then
you
reach
the
question
of
the
certainty
of
the
statute.
it
could
admit
to
a
double
meaning.
and
i
think
that
it
gets
down
to
the
point
that
where
then
is
a
line
drawn?
is
it
drawn
at
22
and
an
eight-inches,
is
it
drawn
at
28-inches,
is
it
drawn
at
17-inches
and
that—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
would
say
that
the
reasonable
man—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
i
think
the
testimony
was
that
that
it
could
be
concealed
in
an
over
coat
as
could
a
full
size
shotgun.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
believe
that
could
be
read
into
the
judge’s
decision
of
submitting
to
a
jury.
i
think
that
the
question
though
is
the
notice
to
the
defendant,
that
is,
would
in
the
reading
of
this
statute—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
no.
i
believe
that
it
could
not.
a
reasonable
man
would
not
conclude
this
weapon
concealable
under
the
language
of
this
statute
because
this
statute
refers
to
pistols,
revolvers
and
other
weapons
capable
of
concealment.
and
i
think
that
is
a
particular
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
it
may
be,
except
i
think
at
that
point
in
determining
the
other
firearms
description—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
it
is
another
firearm
but
not
all
other
firearms
are
within
the
prescription
of
the
statute.
then
its
question,
is
it
not
an
other
firearm
capable
of
concealment
on
the
person?
now,
i
think
that
at
that
point
if
we
do
in
fact
determine
the
statute
and
its
meaning
to
the
man
of
common
intelligence,
according
to
any
principle
of
construction
that
clearly
this
statute
did
was
not
meant
to
apply
the
sort-of
shotguns.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct
and
i
think
it
is
entwined
with
the
argument
that
petition
raises
in
terms
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
terms
of
in
determining
its
vagueness,
i
think
that
we
need
to
look
at
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
one
of
the
principles
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
certain
and
that
it
is
certain
as
applied
to
sort-of
shotguns.
and
i
believe
that
this
statute
interpretive
with
any
kind
of
statutory
construction
would
lend
support
to
the
argument
that
it
does
not
apply
to
sort-of
shotguns.
it
is
not
drawn
with
language
so
that
it
would
apply
to
sort-of
shotgun.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
no,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
in
its
opinion
reach
the
construction
argument.
that
was
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
characterize
this
as
strange,
i
may
characterize
it
as
unfortunate
because
i
believe
there
is
a
construction
argument
there
that
probably
under
the
leadership
of
this
court
it
has
been
clear
in
us
versus
harris
that
if
the
statute
can
be
construed
in
a
constitutional
manner,
then
it
should
be.
and
that
this
statute
in
fact
and
part
of
the
argument
raised
before
this
court
is
that
this
statute
in
fact
can
be
construed
in
a
constitutional
manner.
but
that
construction
would
not
admit
to
the
inclusion
of
the
kind
of
weapon
that
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
i
think
that
i
would
object
on
the
terms
that
it
is
not
a
clear
question
that
the
statute
as
applied
is
so
certain
that
applies
to
sort-of
shotguns.
i
think
that
if
the
court,
if
this
court
decided
that
there
is
a
question
or
an
issue
of
vagueness
and
there
is
a
question
of
vagueness
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
this
case.
to
save
that
statute
from
its
constitutional
challenge
of
being
vague
that
the
court
may
and
in
fact
i
think
the
court
must
at
least
as
i
read
harris
then
interpret
the
statute
so
that
it
can
avoid
the
vagueness
issue
and
i
think
there
is
a
little
doubt
that
there
must
be
some
question
as
to
the
certainty
of
the
statute,
by
the
very
fact
that
we
have
the
court
of
appeals
wondering
and
in
fact
ruling
that
the
statute
does
not
cover
sort-of
shotguns.
i
think
in
a
similar
case
in
colorado,
cockley
(ph)
versus
people,
which
is
on
page
7
in
my
brief.
in
a
similar
statute
they
concluded
that
firearms,
other
firearms
provision
in
a
statute
that
referred
to
pistols,
revolvers,
knives
and
billy
clubs,
the
other
firearms
provision
was
not
within
the
ambient
of
the
that
statute.
so
i
think
there
is
a
considerable
question
as
to
what
application
the
statute
has
and
i
think
that
application
issue
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
language
is
certain
enough
to
advise
a
man
of
common
intelligence
that
the
mailing
of
a
sort-of
shotgun
of
22
and
eighth
inches
is
in
fact
in
violation
of
the
statute,
especially
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
statute
in
the
first
instance
because
i
believe
the
history
of
the
statute
in
the
first
instance
was
that
it
was
to
control
the
mailing
of
pistols
and
revolvers
of
handguns
by
mail-order
people.
i
think
clearly
in
that
history,
it
refers
to
the
sears
and
roebuck
mailing
of
handguns
and
that
the
loss
of
the
control
of
the
states
in
a
mail-order
situation.
this
statute
was
not
meant,
i
do
not
believe
from
its
history
and
from
its
meaning
and
from
its
interpretation
to
be
a
statute,
to
prosecute
one
who
mails
a
single
sort-of
shotgun
in
the
mails.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well
i
think
that
there
are
various
reasons.
number
one
i
think
sort-of
shotguns
are
a
collectors
item.
there
are
dealers
in
sort-of
shotguns
they—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well
sort-of
shotguns
provide
a
less
restrictive
choke
on
the
explosion
of
the
pellets
from
the
shotgun
and
gives
it
a
wider
stream.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well
in
terms
of
what
people
use
them
for,
i
do
not
know
because
i
think
that
is
a
rather
general
question.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
what?
they
may
be
used
to
shoot
people,
they
may
be
used
–
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
would
not
admit
to
that,
no,
that
is
–
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
believe
that
you
could
use
them
in
hunting
birds
for
example
and—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
think
that
you
would
have
a
considerable
problem
as
mr.
justice
raises
at
great
lengths
but
i
am
not
willing
to
admit
that
that
is
the
only
purpose
for
the
reducing
the
size
if
a
barrel.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
if
the
barrel
is
only
sort
of
two
inches
or
three
inches
then
i
think
that
your
range
is
then
proportioned
to
the
reduction
size
of
the
barrel.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
yes
she
did.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
she
purchased
a
riffle,
a
shot
gun
for
her
protection.
that
shotgun
was
not
the
shotgun
i
believe
as
i
recall
it,
there
were
two
shotguns
involved.
the
full
length
shotgun
that
they
did
attribute
to
her
purchasing
was
not
the
shotgun
that
is
against
of
this
appeal.
the
one
that
she
testified
she
purchased
was
in
her
closet.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
as
to
the
sort-of
shotgun,
she
testified
that
she
never
purchased
the
weapon
that
was
subsequently
reduced
to
a
sort-of
shotgun
and
that
the
only
weapon
that
she
purchased
was
in
fact
a
full
length
shotgun
which
was
in
fact
produced
at
trial.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well
i
think
at
that
point
as
i
recall
the
evidence,
her
testimony
was
that
she
put
it
in
there
and
she
just
simply
–
she
was
not
familiar
with
weapons
to
start
with
and
that
she
did
not
in
fact
know
how
to
assemble
or
clean
the
weapon
and
she
placed
it
then
in
the
closet
with
the
idea
of
then
sometime
putting
it
together
and
forgetting
about
it
and
it
was
not
a
long
period
of
time
between
the
purchase
i
think
and
the
subsequent
interrogation
by
the
postal
authority.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct
from
the
record.
and
i
would
hasten
to
point
out
that
that
is
not
the
shotgun
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
appeal.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
oh!
very
much
so
and
i
guess
that
is
not
an
issue
that
is
before
this
court
or
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
terms
of
her
credibility
and
now
one
that
i
could
properly
raise
because
i
believe
that
that
is
truly
within
the
ambient
of
the
jury
to
decide
whether
or
not
she
in
fact
purchased
a
weapon
but
i
think
that
the
question
it
comes
back
to
in
terms
of
its
interpretation,
in
terms
of
the
statutes
meaning,
is
the
statute
certain,
does
a
statute
number
one
give
the
no’s
and
does
it
too
number
one
provide
the
protection
against
an
arbitrary
law
enforcement
and
i
think
that
that
second
part
of
this
connally
test
and
the
same
test
was
raised
in
lanzetta
is
even
evident
in
this
case
because
i
think
that
at
the
point
and
i
can
always
surmise
the
reasons
that
the
prosecutor
decide
to
prosecute
under
this
seldom
used
statute,
one
it
is
to
control
mail
order.
is
that
if
the
prosecutor
did
not
feel
that
he
had
a
sufficient
case
for
other
possible
crimes
that
he
could
have
charged
and
i
think
as
one
of
the
justices
has
pointed
out
could
have
charged
this
defendant
with
and
that
by
the
very
fact
of
the
broadness
of
the
statute
then,
the
prosecutor
had
opened
to
him
a
catch
all
statute,
he
said,
i
do
not,
i
think
this
is
a
fair
supposition,
i
do
not
have
the
evidence
to
convict
her
on
some
other
crime
but
i
can
charge
her
on
this
mailing
crime
and
i
think
that
clearly
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
itself
that
this
charge
should
have
even
then
brought
as
a
mailing
violation
under
the
statute.
there
are
statutes
in
terms
of
possession
that
are
very
clearly
defined
and
sort-of
shotguns
over
statutes.
i
believe
that
that
could
have
been
broad.
i
think
that
i
raised
this
point
only
to
show
that
the
statute
does
in
its
rather
vague
language
prevent
or
permit
an
arbitrary
enforcement
of
the
statute
itself
because
there
is
no
discernible
standard.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
believe
that
his
discretion
is
reduced
except
that
the
statute
as
written,
i
think
in
its
entirety
is
the
statute
to
control
mail
order
shipment
of
pistols
and
revolvers
and
maybe
mail
order
shipment
of
sort-of
shotguns
and
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
prosecute
an
individual
mailing
of
that
kind
of
an
item
so
that
i
do
not
think
that
at
least
practically
that
is
a
purpose
or
has
been
a
use
of
the
statute.
if
although
the—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
no
and
the
prosecutor
can
very
well
bring,
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
clearly
applies
the
sort-of
shotguns.
he
would
be
very
well
within
his
rights
to
bring
this
case
under
the
statute.
but
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
he
did
under
this
statute
as
it
presently
is
written
points
out
to
the
arbitrariness
really
in
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
that
it
was
not
manned
under
its
history
or
its
interpretation
to
bring
up
a
conviction
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
i
say
that
only
as
a
support
of
the
vagueness
argument.
i
think
that
the
other
thing
that
the
court
needs
to
concern
itself
with
is
a
construction
of
the
statute.
i
believe
that
under
the
harris
case
that
this
court
may
and
should
then
if
it
determines
that
the
statutory
language
is
not
so
overly
broad
or
not
so
vague
that
men
of
common
intelligence
could
not
choose
their
path
in
the
conduct
as
prescribed,
could
save
that
challenge
of
the
statute
by
a
fair
construction
of
the
statute.
based
number
one
on
its
language,
pistols
and
revolvers
and
other
firearms
capable
of
concealment
on
the
person,
i
think
that
the
statutory
construction
is
that
pistols
and
revolvers
will
modify
the
general
language
in
the
statute
and
the
general
language
will
be
then
presumed
to
be
of
the
same
class
as
to
pistols
and
revolvers.
pistols
and
revolvers
are
in
the
class
of
handguns
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
clearly
under
that
theory
of
statutory
construction,
this
is
a
statute
to
control
the
unlawful
mailing
of
handguns,
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
statute
and
the
congressional
record
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
only
the
testimony
of
the
tobacco
and
firearms
man
that
because
of
the
recoil
characteristics,
it
would
not
be
a
weapon
that
you
could
fire
arm
extended.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
could
not,
because
of
the
recoil
characteristics
that
are
not
the
same
characteristics
of
a
pistol.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
can
be
fired
with
one
hand
against
the
shoulder
or
against
the
hip
and
that
was
the
testimony.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
would
presume
it
could
be
fired
with
one
hand.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well
i
think
that
the
distinction
between
handgun
and
shoulder
type
weapons
is
not
that
it
can
--
all
guns
are
fired
with
the
hand
or
hands,
can
be
hand
or
hands
gun,
but
i
think
that
the
distinction
is
that
a
handgun
characteristically
can
be
fired
with
one
hand
away
from
the
body
where
a
shoulder
type
of
weapon
needs
to
rest
against
the
body
itself
and
whether
the
structure
be
the
shoulder
or
the
hip,
it
needs
to
rest
against
the
shoulder
or
the
hip
and
i
think
that
is
the
distinction.
not
whether
one
uses
a
hand
to
manipulate
the
trigger
because
all
guns
are
fired
in
that
way.
pistols
and
revolvers
first
i
think
set
up
to
class
in
terms
of
size
and
i
think
that
they
also
setup
the
class
in
terms
of
characteristics.
that
is
--
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
would
say
that
is
not
a
typical
shoulder
gun
but
that
it
is
in
fact
a
shoulder
gun.
again
the
question
why
it
sort-of
for
ultimate
purpose
i
do
not
think
is
one
that
we
can
give
speculation
to,
i
think
the
question
is
that
in
the
argument,
i
am
raising
is
that
pistols
and
revolvers
define
not
only
the
class
and
that
handgun
is
oppose
to
shoulder
but
also
define
the
size
and
that
under
either
of
those
classes,
this
statute
refers
to
pistols
and
revolvers
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
and
that
men
of
common
intelligence
quite
readily
may
assume
that
there
are
not
pistols
and
revolvers
of
22
and
1/8
inches,
in
with
the
barrel
of
ten
inches
and
i
think
that
they
are
not
of
a
bulky
nature.
so
i
would
say
that
at
this
point
it
seems
that
and
it
is
a
construction
argument
in
the
sense
that
if
the
statute
can
be
saved
from
its
vagueness
then
it
must
be
saved
by
construction
but
even
further
that
construction
argument
points
to
the
problem
in
the
statute
in
terms
of
its
certainty
because
from
the
construction,
analysis
of
the
statute,
it
does
not
apply
to
sort-of
shotguns,
it
does
not
govern
a
weapon
of
that
size
or
the
kind
of
crime
it
was
charged.
and
i
would
think
that
other
firearms
capable
of
being
concealed
is
not
anymore
definable,
it
is
symbolic
language
that
has
an
outward
reference
point
and
that
our
reference
point
is
not
clear.
i
do
not
think
it
is
anymore
clearer
than
the
current
rate
per
diem
in
the
connally
case
so
that
i
would
say
in
conclusion
then
that
this
statute
is
unduly
vague
and
that
it
can
be
saved,
i
believe
by
this
court
from
its
vagueness
challenge
by
construction
limiting
it
to
pistols
and
revolvers
and
pistols
type
weapons—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
issues
of
fact
in
terms
of
the—
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
there
was
a
jury
verdict.
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
i
would
say
that
in
terms
of
the
concealability
of
the
weapon
that
there
would
not
be
an
issue
of
fact,
it
may
have,
it
may
require
a
considerable
difference
in
trial
strategy
because
at
the
point
that
the
respondent
assumed
the
position
that
it
was
not
a
concealable
weapon
then
the
respondent
was
not
willing
to
open
up
that
issue
to
the
jury
and
certain
fact
that
it
is
not
a
jury
question.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
well,
except
there
were
six
or
seven
other
items
at
the
court
could
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
as
far
as
i
do
not
believe
that
the
petitioner
or
the
respondent
could
go
back
and
ask
to
open
up
the
evidentiary
hearing
to
show
that
it
was
any
less
concealable.
mr.
jerry
j.
moberg
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
thank
you.
