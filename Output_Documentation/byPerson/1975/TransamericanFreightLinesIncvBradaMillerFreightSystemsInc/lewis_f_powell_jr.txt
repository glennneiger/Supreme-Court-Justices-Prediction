i
am
not
following
entirely
your
argument
about
the
common
law.
if
the
common
law
applied,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
your
indemnity
agreement
would
be
invalid,
are
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
has
absent
such
an
agreement
but
here
you
have
an
agreement,
you
are
not
attacking
the
validity
of
the
agreement
absent
the
icc
regulation,
are
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
leritz,
does
this
indemnity
agreement
on
this
phase,
report
to
shift
liability
in
the
manner
you
have
described?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
else
can
we
view
it
unless
we
get
into
the
facts
of
the
case
and
undertake
to
assess
whether
or
not
the
driver
himself
was
a
cause
of
this
accident.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
only
for
the
lesser’s
negligence
or
the
negligence
of
lesser’s
agents
or
employee?
