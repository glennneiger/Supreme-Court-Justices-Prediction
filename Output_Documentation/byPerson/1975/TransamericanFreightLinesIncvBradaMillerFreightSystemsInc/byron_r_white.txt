you
say
the
driver
here
would
remain
the
employee
of
brada,
i
take
that
he
did.
if
the
driver
is
negligent
and
injured
someone
and
they
say
under
that
victim
sues
the
lessee,
transamerican,
on
what

it
is
not,
but
except

one

operation
or
not,
or
whether
the
lesser
is
really
just
piggy-backing
on
the
lessee’s
