let
me,
let
us
assume
there
was
no
indemnity
agreement,
and
the
third
person
sued
the
lessee
whose
authority
was
being
used
and
whose
bill
of
lading
had
been
issued
i
guess?
now
let
us
assume
no
indemnity
agreement
or
anything,
the
third
party
may
recover
against
the
lessee
may
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
none
of
the
regulations,
so
that
is
a
federal
question?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
is
a
question
of
federal?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
it
is
not
respondeat
superior,
it
is
not
the
fact
that
he
is
an
employee,
it
is
just
the
fact
that
the
federal,
the
federal
regulations
says
the
lessee
is
responsible?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
guess
the
indemnity
agreement
be
irrelevant
in
terms—as
far
as
the
liability
of
the
lessee
under
the
regulations
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
a
third
party’s
claim
against
the—on
your
theory,
a
third
party’s
claim
against
the
lessee
was
strictly
a
federal
law
question
of
the
regulation.
justice
potter
stewart
--is
anyway
that
this
not
be
--
the
driver
is
not
an
employee
of
the
brada.
justice
potter
stewart
--the
lessee
liable
of
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
the
common
law
of
illinois
might
hold
the
driver
to
have
been
a
barrowed
servant
and
therefore
an
agent
of
the
lessee
conceivably,
but
that
is,
we
really
do
not
need
to
get
in
to
that
here
[voice
overlap]
because
the
commission’s
regulation
is
clear,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
attorney
takes
turns
around
the
to
what
extent
must
the
lessee
(inaudible).
this
liable
is
a
matter
of
commission
regulation,
the
lessee.
justice
potter
stewart
no
need
to
go
any
further
that
is
conceded
in
this
case,
i
gather
that
is
not
an
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
lessee,
you
mean.
