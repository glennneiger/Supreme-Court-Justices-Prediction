justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
voorhees,
let
me
clarify
a
couple
of
facts--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
agreement
provide
that
the
lessee
has
the
right
to
reject
the
driver
furnished
by
the
lesser?
will
it
go
that
far?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
understand
it,
the
indemnification
clause
here
does
not
apply
to
the
lessee’s
own
negligence.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
different
if
it
did?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
no.
74-54,
transamerican
freight
lines
against
brada
miller
freight
systems.
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
chicago.
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
the
parent
conflict
in
holdings
and
in
the
underlying
legal
theory
among
the
federal
courts
and
some
state
supreme
courts.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
connection
with
its
regulation
of
motor
carriers,
who
are
operating
in
interstate
commerce,
has
issued
regulations
applicable
to
the
leasing
of
equipment
between
authorized
carriers.
on
of
these
regulations
states
that
the
lessor
carrier
and
the
lessee
carrier
must
agree
in
writing
that
control
and
responsibility
for
the
operation
of
the
equipment
shall
be
that
of
the
lessee.
the
lease
between
the
lessor,
brada
miller,
and
the
lessee,
transamerican,
for
a
tractor
trailer
for
a
single
trip
between
detroit
and
kansas
city
did
in
fact
recite
the
transamerican
was
to
have
control
and
responsibility
for
the
operation
of
the
equipment
in
respect
to
the
public.
the
lease
also
provided,
however,
that
brada
miller,
the
lessor,
agreed
to
indemnify
transamerican
for
claims
arising
out
of
brada
miller’s
negligence.
an
accident
occurred
on
the
trip
allegedly
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
lessor
and
a
person
was
seriously
injured.
she
sued
both
carriers,
and
in
the
litigation,
transamerican
offered
the
defense
to
brada
miller.
it
was
refused
and
thereafter
transamerican
settled
the
lawsuit
with
the
plaintiff,
and
then
it
sought
to
enforce
the
indemnification
agreement
against
brada
miller.
this
was
resisted
on
the
ground
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
control
and
responsibility
provision
of
the
regulation
and
hence
was
against
public
policy.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
granted
brada
miller’s
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
the
indemnification
clause
contravened
the
regulation.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
indemnification
agreement
does
not
contravene
the
interstate
commerce
commission’s
control
and
responsibility
requirement.
and
on
the
facts
before
us,
the
lessee
had
the
required
control
and
responsibility
for
the
leased
vehicle,
and
this
was
so,
despite
the
indemnification
clause,
relating
to
the
lessor’s
negligence.
we
also
hold
that
the
indemnification
provision
does
not
conflict
with
the
commission’s
safety
regulations.
indeed
it
may
promote
rather
than
deter
safety.
consequently,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
douglas
concurs
in
the
judgment.
