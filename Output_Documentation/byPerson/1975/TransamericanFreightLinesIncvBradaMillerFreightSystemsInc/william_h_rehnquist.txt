justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
mr.
voorhees,
a
diversity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
that
if
the
indemnity
agreement
had
been
invalid
under
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
accident
occurred
or
the
state
which
the
case
was
tried,
would
that
make
it
a
different
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
most
states
will
allow
indemnity
agreements
whether
the
person
possibly
negligence
is
seeking
to
recover
from
the
person
actively
negligence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
now
about
the
responsibility
of
the
lessee
and
lesser
inter
say-say
and
not
about
responsibility
to
the
ultimate
plaintiff.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
responsible
to
an
injured
third
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
so,
supposing
you
had
a
single
truck
owned
by
an
individual
who
drove
it
himself,
and
he
leased
it
say
the
transamerican
in
this
case.
now,
if
there
were
no
regulation,
would
not
transamerican
in
many
states
be
able
to
obtain
indemnity
against
him,
just
under
common
law
if
he
were
negligent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
about
the
remark
you
have
made
just
a
moment
ago.
you
say
we
are
looking
to
the
question
of
whether
this
agreement
is
against
public
policy
in
general.
now
all
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
was
there
was
contrary
to
the
icc
regulations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
you
are
going
to
sustain
the
seventh
circuitâ€™s
holding
it
would
not
be
enough
to
show
that
the
seventh
circuit
might
if
it
had
taken
a
different
tack,
decided
that
it
was
against
public
policy
in
illinois
or
michigan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
are
talking
about
practicalities,
mr.
leritz,
as
you
are,
is
transamerican
generally
insured
against
this
sort
of
thing
as
brada
miller
insured
against
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
a
self-insured
for
purposes
of
this.
