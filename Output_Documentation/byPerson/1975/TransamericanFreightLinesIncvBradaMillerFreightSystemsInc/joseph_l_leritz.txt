mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case
takes
a
somewhat
different
view
of
the
various
liabilities
and
the
right
of
control
and
the
fact
of
control.
the
questions
presented
by
the
petitioner,
the
respondent
and
the
icc
and
the
united
states,
and
i
will
refer
to
it
as
the
icc
for
simplicity,
are
a
little
bit
different.
the
petitioner
states
that
the
question
before
the
court
is
where
the
lessee
assumes
control
and
responsibility
for
the
tractor
and
trailer
is
an
indemnity
caused
in
an
otherwise
vital
least
agreement
against
the
regulations.
the
respondent
sees
the
question
as
whether
an
agreement
to
indemnify
for
losses,
due
to
the
operation
of
the
equipment,
is
in
violation
of
the
regulations
and
the
icc
sees
the
question
as
whether
the
agreement
to
indemnify
for
loses—whether
the
regulation
for
prohibits
the
lesser
from
agreeing
to
indemnify
the
lessee
for
losses
caused
by
the
negligence
of
the
lesser.
now
in
the
amici
curiae
brief,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
claims
that
indemnity
agreements,
such
as
we
have
here,
are
beneficial
because
they
tend
to
place
the
responsibility
for
the
loss,
for
the
casualty,
where
it
belongs.
the
icc
assumes
that
the
negligence
of
the
driver
is
the
negligence
of
the
lesser,
and
it
is
respondent’s
position
in
this
case
that
the
icc
is
incorrect
in
that
for
reasons
i
hope
to
develop
in
my
argument.
the
regulations
require
that
the
exclusive
possession
control
and
use
of
the
equipment
remain
in
the
lessee,
and
of
course
not
in
the
lesser.
now,
in
the
icc
brief,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
takes
the
position
that
the
regulations
do
not
require
the
lessee
to
operate
the
equipment
itself.
the
lesser
can
perform
that
task
by
furnishing
the
driver
as
well
as
the
equipment,
and
that
subject
to
authority
and
responsibili—responsibility
of
the
regulations,
it
can
allow
the
lesser
to
perform
the
ministerial
tasks
of
moving
the
freight.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
interstate
commerce
commission’s
position
and
the
petitioner’s
commission
that
the
actual
movement
of
the
freight,
the
actual
work
is
done
by
the
lesser.
on
page
eight
of
the
brief
states
that
the
mere
performance
by
the
lesser
of
physical
operation
of
leased
equipment
does
not
negate
the
lessee’s
control
and
responsibility.
and
further
on
page
nine,
under
certain
circumstances,
an
indemnity
cause
might
help
to
induce
the
lesser
properly
to
perform
the
ministerial
tasks
that
under
the
regulations
can
be
assigned
to
it.
the
indemnity
cause
might
help
the
lessee
influence
performance
of
the
lesser
and
thereby
exercise
control
and
responsibility
over
the
lesser.
and
finally
on
page
sixteen,
the
amici
curiae
brief
states
that
providing
the
driver
at
least
physical
moment-to-moment
control
of
the
vehicle
and
the
lesser,
this
is
the
control
over
ministerial
tasks
and
the
icc
states
is
it
not
the
control
and
responsibility
required
by
the
regulations.
now,
i
think
that
the
icc’s
position
that
the
party
who
is
responsible
in
fact
and
the
negligent
party
shall
ultimately
bear
the
loss,
it
is
the
correct
position.
however,
i
think
it
is
based
on
a
false
premise
and
therefore
the—although
the
logic
is
good
the
conclusion
is
wrong.
and
i
say
this
by
going
back
to
the
history
of
master
of
the
master-servant
relationship.
let
us
assume
that
there
was
no
regulation
in
this
case,
i
think
these
matters
would
be
governed
by
traditional
questions
of
respondeat
superior,
master
and
servant,
agent
and
principal.
i
think,
well
i
know
that
all
of
the
cases
that
have
considered
this
particular
problem,
the
state
cases
and
the
federal
cases,
have
held
the
opposite
that
the
lessee
operates
and
trans-operates
the
vehicle
and
transports
the
freight
under
the
common
law
and
under
the
regulations.
now,
getting
back
to
our
assumption
that
this
is
a
common
law
rather
than
a
regulation
matter,
there
is
no
regulation.
when
the
lessee
takes
over
control
of
the
truck
and
of
the
driver,
the
driver
becomes
the
special
employee
of
the
lessee,
he
still
may
remain
in
the
general
employee
of
the
lesser
but
traditionally
under
our
law
and
i
think
cases
almost
all
hold
this,
that
in
the
event
of
the
negligence
of
the
driver
in
that
situation
that
the
responsibility
would
be
the
responsibility
of
the
lesser.
we
must
remember,
of
the
lessee
i
am
sorry,
of
the
lessee,
yes
sir
i
am
sorry.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
well
i
think
both,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
hope
to
explain.
a
party
a
lesser
to
a
lessee
is
not
negligent
itself
it
only
can
be
negligent
through
the
act
of
the
driver.
now,
in
this
particular
situation
and
the
situations,
which
are
generally
considered,
the
driver
is
driving
down
the
road
and
it
commits
a
negligent
act.
the
act
is
an
act
of
an
individual,
some
employee
or
co-employer,
or
corporation,
or
other
party
through
a
legal
fiction
is
responsible
for
that
person’s
act.
now
assuming
there
was
no
regulation,
who
would
be
the
party
responsible
for
the
driver’s
act?
under
the
common
law,
and
i
think
i
can
say
this
having
investigated
it
having
practiced
in
this
field
for
a
long
time,
under
the
common
law
this—the
special
employer,
the
lessee
in
this
case,
would
be
responsible--
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
yes
sir,
responsible
to
an
injured
third
party.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
yes
sir,
they
could,
against
him
in
the
same
way
in
that
in
this
case,
transamerican
could
obtain
indemnity
against
the
driver
hardrick,
but
you
see
they
are
not
attempting
to
obtain
indemnity
from
the
driver
hardrick
but
from
brada
miller
who
is
hardrick’s
general
employer.
there
is
a
difference
there;
the
driver
is
always
subject
to
indemnify
his
principle,
whether
he
be
brada
miller
or
transamerican,
the
driver
being
the
ultimately
responsible
person
is
always
the
person
who
theoretically
at
least
must
pay.
and
in
a
situation
you
gave,
the
driver
being
the
owner
of
the
truck
must
pay,
the
question
in
this
case
is
must
brada
miller
being
the
general
employer
of
the
driver
of
the
truck
pay,
and
i
think
that
is
a
different
issue,
your
honor.
now,
under
common
law
principles
of
respondeat
superior,
i
am
going
to
refer
the
courts
that
i
have
to
two
missouri
cases
one
of
which
mr.
voorhees
was
involved
in,
it
is
in
my
brief,
branica
versus
transamerican
428
southwest
2d
524,
and
barshed
truck
lines
versus
gerry
lips
424
southwest
2d
81.
and
i
think
it
is
the
general
law
throughout
the
country
and
always
has
been.
the
courts
generally
hold
that
under
the
common
law
principles
of
respondeat
superior
for
a
person
to
become
a
special
employer,
three
things
are
necessary.
first,
the
employee
must
consent
to
enter
into
the
special
employment.
second,
he
must
as
a
matter
of
fact
enter
into
the
special
employment
and
go
forward
with
the
employment.
and
third,
the
special
employer
must
have
the
right
to
control
his
actions.
if
those
three
conditions
are
met,
then
the
driver
comes
in
to
the
special
employ,
of
in
this
case
transamerica,
and
transamerica
would
then
be
liable
to
the
general
public
for
any
negligence
of
the
driver.
now,
were
those
three
conditions
met,
i
think
they
obviously
were.
hardrick
here
did
enter,
did
agree
to
enter
into
the
special
employ,
he
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
enter
on
to
this
special
employ
by
driving
the
truck
and
transamerican
did
have
the
control,
in
fact
as
well
as
under
the
regulations.
now,
if
that
is
the
common
law,
if
the
common--
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
yes
sir,
it
had
that
much
control.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
i
think
it
had
more
control
as
i
hoped
to
develop,
maybe
i
am
wrong,
but
i
think
i
can
develop
some
more
control.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
if
the
common
law
applied
there
would
be,
may
i
say
if
the
common
law
applied
absent
in
indemnity
agreement,
there
would
be
no
right
of
indemnity
from
transamerican
against
brada
miller.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
under
the
law
of
many
states,
sir,
an
indemnity
agreement
will
not
be
given
any
credence
if
unless
it
agrees
to
indemnify
the
indemnitor—the
indemnity
against
his
own
negligence.
now,
in
the
state
of
missouri
that
is
the
law,
in
some
other
states
i
think
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
is
the
law.
in
other
words,
i
cannot
agree
to
indemnify
you
against
your
own
negligence
unless
i
specifically
in
the
indemnity
agreement
state
i
will
do
so.
so
i
would
say
that
the
indemnity
agreement
in
this
case,
under
the
common
law,
is
certainly
in
question,
and
i
think
all
indemnity
agreements
of
this
kind
under
the
common
law
are
in
question.
whether
this
particular
one--
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
well,
in
any
state,
mr.
justice
marshall,
or
in
some
states.
in
missouri
for
example,
i
think
it
would
be
questionable.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
well
the
reason
i
say
that,
if
i
may,
is
that
we
are
looking
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
agreement
is
against
public
policy
in
general.
now--
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
it
is?
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
and
may
i
explain
why
i
think
that?
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
yes
sir,
that
is
correct,
i
would
say
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
that
is
correct.
i
think
though
that
the
regulations
add
additional
reasons,
in
other
words
we
had
a
situation
where
the
common
law
absent
the
regulations
states
where
the
negligence
lies
and
where
responsibility
lies.
now
the
regulations
come
along
and
reinforce
that,
they
do
not
take
anything
away
from
the
common
law
they
reinforce
the
common
law.
they
make
it
clear
that
under
a
situation
such
as
this,
the
control—the
possession,
control,
and
use
of
the
equipment
is
in
the
lessee.
that
is
what
the
regulations
says,
control
of
the
equipment.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
the
icc
does
not,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
alright,
i
believe
that—i
believe
that
the
icc’s
position
is
based
on
a
false
premise,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
false
premise
is
that
the
control
of
the
equipment
and
of
the
driver
remains
in
the
lesser.
i
think
that
is
the
false
premise.
now
the
icc
has
stated,
and
i
quote—paraphrase,
“the
objective
of
safe
operation
might
be
frustrated
if
the
indemnity
clause
also
requires
the
lesser
to
indemnify
the
lessee
for
the
lessee’s
negligence.
in
other
words
the
icc,
and
if
i
understand
that
statement
correctly,
takes
the
position
that
if
it’s
the
indem—if
the
indem,
i
am
sorry.
if
the
lesser
is
called
upon
to
indemnify
the
lessee
for
the
lessee’s
own
negligence,
then
the
purpose—then
the
indemnity
agreement
does
then
to
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
regulations.
so
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
determine
whose
negligence
is
involved
here.
is
it
the
negligence
of
hardrick,
the
negligence
of
the
lesser,
or
the
negligence
of
the
lessee?
if
the
negligence
if
hardrick
is
the
negligence
of
the
lessee,
then
if
read
the
icc’s
brief
correctly,
then
the
icc
would
take
the
possession
well
there
it
should
remain;
and
it
would
not
be
proper
under
the
regulations
and
it
would
not
follow
that
the
liability
should
be
shifted
from
a
non-negligent—from
a
negligent
to
a
non-negligent
part.
there
are
also
some
practical
reasons,
if
might
cite
someway,
these
regulations
might
be
con—i
am
sorry,
why
these
indemnity
agreements
might
be
contrary
to
the
regulations
and
might
be
against
public
policy.
as
the
court
knows
from
reading
the
respondent’s
brief,
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
driver
in
this
case
have
the
right
and
authority
to
enter
into
this
contract.
i
know
that
is
not
a
question
for
this
court
and
i
know
this
court
will
not
decide
that.
but
it
brings
up
an
important
part—point,
here
you
have
a
situation
where
a
driver
comes
up
to
the
doorway
of
a
trucking
company
with
a
truck
and
solicits
a
load,
and
it
takes
a
load.
the
lessee
describes
the
cargo,
tells
him,
decides
what
kind
of
cargo
is
to
be
carried,
whether
a
dangerous
cargo
or
other
cargo,
how
it
is
to
be
loaded,
where
it
is
to
be
taken,
the
route
by
which
it
is
to
be
taken,
the
lessee
describes
and
gives
instructions,
any
especial
instructions
with
regard
to
the
trip
itself.
the
lessee
gives
the
driver
expense
money,
the
lessee
checks
the
driver’s
medical
records,
the
lessee
makes
an
inspection
of
the
truck
itself,
in
the
event
of
an
accident
the
lessee—the
driver
reports
to
the
lessee
and
the
lessee
in
turn
reports
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
i
think
all
of
this
taken
together
show
a
great
deal
of
practical
control
of
the
lesser
over
the
trip
and
the
driver
and
the
equipment
itself.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
the
lessee,
i
am
sorry,
the
lessee,
yes
sir.
a
great
deal
of
practical
control,
and
the
law
puts
that
control
there,
the
common
law
puts
that
control
there
and
the
regulations
put
that
control
there.
now--
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
lessee--
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
that
is
correct.
of
course,
no
one
can
control
that
i
suppose.
if
a
driver
is
going
to
be
negligent,
he
is
going
to
be
negligent.
so
we
have
to
look
elsewhere,
where
is
the
law
place
the
responsibility,
where
do
the
practicalities
placed
the
responsibility,
where
do
the
regulations
place
the
responsibility.
i
might
just
point
out
again
some
practical
reasons.
in
this
particular
case
brada
miller
did
not
know
of
this
accident
for
four
months,
its
investigation
of
the
accident
was
impeded,
the
accident
was
not
reported
by
the
lesser
for
about
four
months,
he
report
it
to
the
icc
for
about
four
months.
it
is
respondent’s
position
that
if
a
lessee
knows
or
thinks
that
it
is
going
to
be
reimbursed
or
indemnified
for
an
accident,
it
does
not
have
the
incentive
to
do
what
it
must
do
and
to
make
a
prompt
investigation
and
attempt
to
make
a
prompt
settlement.
i
think
a
rule
such
as
this,
i
am
sorry,
i
think
an
indemnity
agreement
which
shifts
liability
will
tend
to
have
an
inhibiting
effect
an
investigations
and
on
settlements
of
claims.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
brada
miller
is
insured
above
a
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
does
not
involve
this—the
amount
of
money
here,
there
is
a
financial
responsibility
arrangement.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
that
is
my
understanding,
sir,
yes.
i
should—i
would
like
to
close
with
the
following
comments.
these
indemnity
agreements
at
best
are
questioned,
they
at
best—at
worst
they
actually
take
the
responsibility
from
where
the
law
places
it,
and
the
regulations
place
it,
and
the
practicality
has
placed
it,
and
shift
it
to
where
it
does
not
belong.
they
take
it
and
the
respondent’s
position
to—position
the
respondent’s
takes,
the
indemnity
agreement
takes
the
ultimate
financial
responsibility
from
the
lessee,
who
has
control
under
the
common
law
under
the
regulations
and
under
the
practicalities,
and
puts
it
in
the
lesser
who
does
not
have
those
responsibilities
and
control.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
regulations,
despite
the
position
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
contrary
to
good
practice,
to
good—to
good
practice
in
the
trucking
industry.
why
not
leave
the
ultimate
responsibility
where
the
law
places
it.
if
for
example
the
negligence
is
the
negligence
of
the
lessee
through
the
driver,
leave
the
ultimate
responsibility
with
the
lessee,
if
the
negligence
is
the
negligence
of
the
lessee
through
some
other
act
of
the
lessee,
then
leave
the
responsibility—the
ultimate
responsibility
with
the
lesser.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
lesser
is
negligent,
the
lesser
is
responsible
and
the
lessee
would
have
a
cause
of
action
over
without
an
indemnity
agreement,
allow
the
law,
not
the
artificial
indemnity
agreement,
to
place
the
ultimate
responsibility
where
it
belongs.
i
think
under
those
circumstances
the
law
would
best
be
served,
it
would
cut
down
litigation
of
which
there
is
considerable
amount
in
this
area,
and
unless
the
court
does
take
such
a
position
these
cases
are
going
to
continue
to
be
litigated
because
the
only
thing,
as
i
understand,
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
these
kinds
of
agreements
are
contrary
to
public
policy
because
of
the
regulations.
if
the
court
says,
no
they
are
not
and
we
will
allow
them,
then
we
will
continue
to
have
litigation
under
the
law
of
the
various
states
under
the
provisions
of
the
various
contracts.
i
respectfully
submit
on
behalf
of
respondent
that
the
court
hold
that
indemnity
agreements,
which
tend
to
shift
liability,
from
that
party
who
is
ultimately
responsible
under
the
law
to
some
party
who
is
not
responsible
under
the
law
should
be
condemned.
then
i
think,
your
honors,
that
the
regulations
will
be
complied
with,
the
common
law
would
be
followed,
and
the
litigation
will
be
terminated.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
not
on
this
phase,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
well
mr.
justice
powell,
it
does
on
its
phase
for
this
reason.
it
says
that
the
lesser
will
indemnify
the
lessee
for
the
lesser’s
negligence
and
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
leritz
right,
but
it
also
in
another
part
of
the
agreement
states
that
the
lesser,
that
the
driver
is
not
an
agent
of
the
lessee
but
rather
remains
an
agent
of
the
lesser,
which
is
contrary
to
fact,
to
common
law
and
to
the
regulations.
the
provisions
of
the
lease
in
this
case,
which
attempt
to
both
through
the
indemnity
agreement
by
stating
that
the
driver
remains
the
agent
of
the
lesser
and
is
not
the
agent
of
the
lessee
is
contrary
to
fact
in
law.
there
are
many
provisions
of
this
agreement
which
attempt
to
bolster
the
indemnity—the
indemnity
agreement.
and
in
doing
so
they
cite
statements
that
are—cite
facts
i
should
say,
or
tempt
to
cite
facts
which
are
contrary
to
the
true
facts.
