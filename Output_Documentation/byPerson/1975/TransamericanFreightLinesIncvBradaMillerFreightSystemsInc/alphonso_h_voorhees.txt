mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
voorhees,
i
am
from
saint
luis
missouri,
and
i
represent
transamerican
freight
lines,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
case
is
hereby
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit.
the
facts
of
this
case
involved
a
lease
of
equipment
between
two
trucking
companies,
two
certificated
carriers.
they
start
on
january
19,
1968
at
which
time
the
lesser
the
owner
of
the
equipment,
a
tractor
and
trailer
leased
the
equipment
to
transamerican
freight
lines.
the
lesser
was
brada
miller
freight
systems,
the
respondent
here
leased
the
equipment
to
transamerican
freight
lines
to
carry
a
load
of
steel
from
detroit,
michigan,
at
which
point
the
lease
was
entered
into
to
kansas
city,
missouri.
during
the
progress
of
the
lease
and
the
carriage
of
the
steel,
the
truck
was
involved
in
an
accident
in
illinois
and
injuring
one
sandra
wear
seriously,
and
she
later
filed
suit
against
both
brada
miller
and
transamerican.
prior
to
trial
sandra
wear,
dismissed
her
case
against
brada
miller
and
proceeded
to
trial
against
transamerican
freight
lines.
during
the
course
of
which
trial,
transamerican
entered
into
a
settlement
with
sandra
wear.
the
lease
agreement
between
the
parties
leasing
the
equipment,
provided
for
the
lease
of
the
equipment
and
provided
that
the
lesser,
brada
miller,
would
furnish
a
driver,
one
hardrick,
who
would
operate
the
equipment
during
the
term
do
the
lease.
the
lease
also
contained
an
indemnity
agreement
providing
that
in
the
event
of
a
loss,
the
lesser
brada
miller,
would
hold
the
lessee
transamerican,
harmless
from
any
loss,
which
resulted
from
the
negligence
of
the
lesser,
or
its
agents,
or
servants.
the
lease
provided
that
the
driver
was
to
be
considered
an
employee
and
agent
of
the
lesser
during
the
terms
of
the
lease.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
handed
down
regulations,
some
twenty
years
ago,
governing
the
relationship
of
parties
involving
in
the
leasing
or
the
transfer
of
equipment
from
one
person
or
company
to
another
for
a
trip,
which
is
what
we
call
this,
in
other
words
the
equipment
was
leased
for
one
trip.
and
the
regulations
of
the
commission
set
forth
certain
requirements
which
must
be
met
by
the
parties
to
the
lease
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
applying
to
our
case,
one
of
the
regulations
states,
and
i
am
quoting
out
of
the
middle
of
section
1057
3(a)
of
the
regulations,
that
the
two
carriers
involved
in
the
lease
must
have
first
agreed
in
writing
that
control
and
responsibility
for
the
operation
of
the
equipment
shall
be
that
of
the
lessee.
this
case
was
argued
and
decided
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
that
court
held
that
the
indemnity
agreement
involved
here
violated
the
control
and
responsibility
provisions
of
the
commerce
commissions
regulations.
the
purpose
of
this
lawsuit
is
a
suit
by
transamerican
the
lessee,
against
brada
the
lesser,
to
recover
the
amount
which
transamerican
had
paid
sandra
wear
to
settle
the
lawsuit
plus
the
expenses
involved.
as
i
say
the
narrow
issue
is
now
whether
or
not
the
indemnity
provision
in
the
lease
agreement
violates
the
control
and
responsibility
provisions
of
the
regulations
of
the
commission.
the
seventh
circuit
among
the
circuits,
among
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
stands
alone
in
holding
that
the
indemnity
provisions
are
in
violation
of
these
regulations.
and
on
the
other
side,
and
holding
directly
opposite,
are
decisions
of
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
and
by
implication
a
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit,
all
of
which
cases
are
cited
in
the
briefs.
the
question
the
commission
has
in
the
past
resided
that
when
they
talk
about
control
and
responsibility,
and
i
will
quote,
possibly
subject
to
some
qualifications
it
may
be
stated
that
when
a
certificate
are
permit
holder;
furnishes
service
in
vehicles
owned
and
operated
by
others,
he
must
control
the
service
to
the
same
extent
as
if
he
owned
the
vehicles,
but
need
to
control
the
vehicles
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
be
responsible
to
the
shipper,
the
public
and
the
commission
for
the
transportation.
this
lease
provided
and
was
complied
within
this
respect
that
the
equipment
during
the
term
of
the
lease
was
identified
as
that
of
the
lessee,
the
signs,
decals,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
of
the
transamerican
freight
lines
were
placed
on
the
truck
and
were
on
the
truck
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
the
truck
was
required
to
and
was
following
the
certificate
of
the
routes
of
the
transamerican
freight
lines,
and
transamerican
in
carrying
out
its
responsibility,
which
is
provided
for
by
the
lease
and
the
regulations
has
ultimately
paid
the
injured
party
in
this
case.
as
i
have
quoted
from
comments
of
the
commission
in
the
prior
hearings,
the—it
is
not
necessary,
it
is
not
the
dealing
of
the
commission
that
the
lessee
has
to
control
the
direct
minute-to-minute,
day-to-day
operation
of
the
vehicle.
the
lessee
must
control
the
service,
that
is
the
routes,
the
identity
of
the
equipment,
other
things
which
are
provided
for
in
the
regulations,
but
as
far
as
the
actual
operation
of
the
vehicle
itself,
the
lessee
is
permitted
to
allow
this
equipment
or
direct
that
it
be
in
effect
operated
by
others
as
long
as
it,
the
lessee,
is
responsible
for
the
operations.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
mr.
justice
blackmun,
yes.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
the
agreement
does
not
specifically
provide
that,
in
fact
the
agreement
in
this
case,
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner’s
brief,
provides
that
the
person
operating
the
truck
shall
be
howard
hardrick,
the
employee
of
brada
miller.
it
does
not—now
by
implication,
or
i
guess
by
actual
words,
by
making
that
provision
the
lessee
has
at
least
accepted
howard
hardrick
as
a
driver
of
the
equipment.
hardrick
was
an
employee
of
the
lesser
brada,
prior
to
the
time
of
the
lease,
he
was
an
employee
of
brada
after
the
lease
and,
by
the
terms
of
the
lease
was
an
employee
of
brada
the
lesser
at
the
time
of
the
lease.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
that
is
true.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
no.
i
think
if
we
read
the
amici
curiae
brief
filed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
united
states,
they
are
discussing
the
fact
that
ultimately
they
may
enact
regulations
regulating
the
area
of
indemnity
agreements.
their
briefs
states
quite
clearly
that
they
do
not
feel
that
their
present
regulations
do
control
these
agreements,
and
they
state
that
when
they
do
enact
such
regulations
they
would
consider
allowing
indemnity
agreements
in
certain
instances
and
not
allowing
them
in
other
instances.
but
at
this
point
the
position
is
that
no
regulations
have
been
made
controlling
the
indemnity
agreement,
prohibiting
them
or
allowing
them,
they
did
not
just
mention
therefore
the
indemnity
agreement
we
contend
is
proper.
now,
your
question
is
directed
to
if
it
was
the
negligence
of
the
lessee,
and
i
think
if
we
read
the
amici
curiae
brief,
their
feeling
is
that
when
they
enact
regulations
they
would
probably
provide
that
negligence
of
the
lessee
would
preclude
its
recovery
under
an
indemnity
agreement,
but
this
has
not
been
regulated
at
this
time?
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
it
was
diversity,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
i
think
that
that
would.
now,
this
question
has
not
been
gone
into,
the
agreement
was
entered
into
in
michigan,
the
accident
occurred
in
illinois,
the
three
case
was
tried
and
is
presently
pending
in
the
federal
courts
in
illinois.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
yes,
they
do,
and
michigan
and
illinois,
and
i
do
not
attempt
to
state
which
law
i
think
would
govern
here
but
those
are
the
two
obvious
states
to
look
to.
michigan
and
illinois
both
provide
that
a
person
may
indemnify
himself
against
his
own
negligence
if
the
indemnity
agreement
specifically
so
provides.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
that,
mr.
justice
white,
that
question,
i
will
answer
it
but
it
is
not
involved,
i
contend
in
the
issues
before
this
court.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
if
i
may
go
in
to
a
little
history
and
going
back
years,
this
type
of
agreements
i
think
generally
fell
into
the
category
of
what
was
known
as
the
“independent
contractor
relationship.”
the
lessee
of
the
equipment,
if
sued
would
generally
defend
and
say
that
the
person
from
whom
he
lease
the
equipment
was
an
independent
contractor
and
lessees’
generally
i
think
successfully
defended
on
that
ground.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
commission
was
attempting
to
regulate,
i
think
that
individual
owners
of
equipment,
probably
not
well-maintained--
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
the
third
party,
under
the
regulations,
could
recover
against
the
lessee.
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
two
purpose--
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
yes.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
yes.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
you
say
if
there
were
no
indemnity
agreement
to
follow
that
on--
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
as
far
as
the
liability
of
the
lessee
and
it
was
in
this
case
there
was
no
question
that
the
lessee
was
liable,
and
the
lessee
has
accepted
the
responsibility
and
paid.
now,
to
track
back
a
little
bit
on
this
history
the
commission
may
enacted
these
regulations
and
one
of
the
principle
things
that
they
were
concerned
about
was
lessee’s
dodging
liability
i
think,
so
they
said
that
the
lessee
should
be
responsible.
and
then
i
say
this,
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
regulations
of
the
commission
have
been
carried
out
in
this
case,
they
have
been
followed
by
the
parties.
well
now,
this
regulation
has
been
held
by
a
couple
of
the
cases
in
the
briefs,
makes
the
employee
a
statutory
or
special
employee
for
whose
acts
the
lessee
is
liable.
but
for
the
regulations,
the
driver
and
his
employer
would
be
independent
contractors,
i
mean
whatever
that
means,
[laughter]
it
means
different
things
i
suppose
from
case
to
case.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that,
i
am
not
really
quite
sure
if
a
violation
of
the,
or
a
question
involving
the--
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
yes.
now,
again
it
probably
is,
in
other
words
the
liability
of
the
lessee
is
set
by
the
regulations.
whether
that
is
a
sufficient--
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
on
the
statute
or
the
regulations,
make
him
such
--
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
i
think
that
that
is
true
using
common
definitions
of
word
employee.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
that
is
correct.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
i
find
in
defining
the
word
control
of
an
employee
to
involve
some
rather
nebulous
phrases
and
sometimes
beyond
those
fictitious.
an
employer
is
not
going
to
control
the
minute-to-minute
operations
of
a
driver
driving
a
truck.
he
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
prevent
him
from
going
too
fast
or
from
failing
to
stop
at
an
appropriate
time,
he
is
going
to—the
control
involved
here
is
twofold.
the
lessee
controls
in
that
he
tells
the
driver
where
to
go
and
what
routes
to
follow
and
what
reports
to
file
and
prepare,
the
lesser
controls
because
the
lesser
is
the
continuing
employer,
the
lesser
is
the
one
that
the
man
is
going
to
be
working
for
next
week.
chances
are
the
lessee
would
not
see
this
driver
again
after
the
end
of
this
particular
trip.
so
that
the
lesser
is
then
the
one
that
has
the
right
to
discipline
the
employee
if
he
has
violated
traffic
regulations,
or
has
done
something
wrong
and
the
lesser
is
the
one
that
could
discharge
him,
or
provide
some
other
type
of
discipline.
now,
there
are
two,
aside
from
the
fact
that
we
have
the
authority
of
several
circuits
maintaining
that
these
indemnity
agreements
are
not
in
violation
of
the
regulations.
two
basic
reasons
here,
which
i
urge
are
first
the
basic
concept
of
freedom
of
contract;
i
have
quoted
in
the
brief
from
a
case
that
is
quite
old
from
this
court,
a
1900
case,
and
it
is
baltimore
and
ohio,
southwestern
railway
company
versus
white,
provides
that
the
contract
between
parties
should
not
be
invalidated
unless
it
is
clearly
against
public
policy,
public
right
or
public
welfare.
additionally,
the
courts
have
held
and
this
court
in
the
case
of
bowles
against
seminole
rock
and
sand
company,
that
the
interpretations
by
an
administrative
agency
of
the
government
of
its
own
regulations
are
entitled
to
great
weight(ph)
and
they
become
controlling,
and
this
is
a
quote
from
the
bowles
case,
“become
of
controlling
weight
unless
it
is
plainly
erroneous
or
inconsistent
with
the
regulations.”
the
amici
brief,
filed
in
this
case
by
the
commission
and
by
the
united
states,
takes
the
strong
position
that
they
have
not
attempted
to
regulate
indemnity
agreements
that
they
feel
that
the
indemnity
agreement
in
this
case
is
appropriate
and
is
valid.
and
that
they
do
discuss
the
fact
that
in
the
future
they
may
attempt
to
regulate
these
agreements,
i
think
you
can
assume
from
reading
their
brief
that
they
probably
will
but
they
have
not
at
this
point.
i
think
that
basically
that
concludes
my
argument
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions?
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
i
have
some
time,
reserved.
mr.
alphonso
h.
voorhees
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
one
or
two
quick
comments.
first,
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier
the
question
here
is
the
issue,
the
narrow
issue
is
what
has
the
commission
done,
and
i
believe
that
most
of
mr.
leritz
argument
was
directed
to
what
should
they
do.
since
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
question
i
hesitate
to
get
into
it,
however
i
note
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
the
briefs
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
unites
states,
they—well
as
a
matter
of
a
fact
in
a
part
of
their
brief
including
a
footnote,
they
refer
to
probably
what
they
would
do
and
the
beneficial
aspects
of
indemnity
agreements
in
general
if
they
should
ever
reach
the
point
of
regulating
this
indemnity
agreements.
in
this
footnote,
they
refer
to
a
1973
university
of
chicago
law
review
article,
which
tries
to
assess
or
appraise
the
economic
approach
to
accidents
and
to
the
master-servant
relationship
and
to
the
independent
contractor
relationship.
and
the
gist
of
the
article
is
that
the
person
writing
that
article
reaches
the
conclusion
that
liability
should
ultimately
be
with
the
person
who
has
the
most
control
over
the
ultimate
prevention
of
the
accidents.
he
advocates
in
this
article
the
use
of
indemnity
agreements
to
allocate
that
liability.
he
says
in
his
view
there
should
not
be
any
distinction
between
independent
contractor
and
master-servant
relationships
that
it
would
be
ideal
for
both
parties,
were
at
common
law
liable,
and
then
they
could
adjust
their
differences
between
themselves
by
means
of
indemnity
agreement,
and
thereby
put
the
blame
on
the
person
who
theoretically
would
be
in
a
best
position
to
prevent
accidents.
and
as
we
have
shown
here,
brada
miller
is
the
company
that
would
have
the
control
over
determining
or
analyzing
latent
defects
to
their
equipment
that
transamerican
may
not
be
able
to
find
by
inspection.
also,
brada
the
lesser,
is
the
company
that
has
the
ultimate
employer-employee
control
over
their
driver.
they
have
the
means
of
weeding
out
drivers
with
bad
driving
history,
they
have
the
means
of
disciplinary
or
discharging,
and
the
best
means
of
providing
safe
drivers.
so
as
i
say,
even
though
that
is
not
the
question
in
this
case,
when
we
consider
various
authorities
on
what
should
be
done,
this
particular
authority
cited
in
the
amici
curiae
brief
does
endorse
and
advocate
the
approach
of
use
of
indemnity
agreements.
i
think
that
concludes
the
petitioner’s
argument.
thank
you.
