mr.
burton
marks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
mr.
garner
submitted
some
income
tax
returns
for
the
year
1965,
1966,
and
1967
in
which
he
stated
certain
information
which
turned
out
to
be
highly
incriminating
to
him
in
a
trial
which
involved
some
activities,
allegedly
engaged
in
1968.
in
1965,
he
stated
his
occupation
as
required
by
the
tax
return
to
be
a
professional
gambler.
in
1966
and
1967,
he
stated
he
was
a
horseman,
but
his
wagering
income
was
or
his
total
was
stated
to
be
as
a
result
of
wagering
income.
mr.
burton
marks
probably
not.
would
--
it
would
depend
because
one
of
the
interesting
propositions
with
respect
to
income
tax
reporting
is
when
you
define
what
you
are
or
where
your
income
came
from,
you
also
define
the
consequences
of
what
types
of
deductions
you
can
use.
therefore,
if
mr.
garner
had
denied
he
was
speculating
on
this,
he
defined
himself
as
a
self-employed
bank
robber,
he
may
have
been
able
to
take
depreciation
for
his
get-away
car,
whereas
if
he
is
a
gambler,
the
only
thing
that
he
could
take
is
a
deduction
against
wins
would
be
losses.
so
--
mr.
burton
marks
payment
for
tips?
mr.
burton
marks
perhaps,
it
might
be.
that
would
be
within
the
scope
of
his
business.
mr.
burton
marks
as
to
his
occupation,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
burton
marks
they
did
with
respect
to
mr.
garner
at
least
--
mr.
burton
marks
pardon
me.
prior
to
that?
mr.
burton
marks
i
really
do
not
know
whether
they
did
or
not.
i
really
cannot
answer
that
question.
it
seems
that
we
are
in
between
and
i
have
some
--
some
thoughts
on
that
situation.
the
case
that
we
have
here
appears
to
be
in
a
sense,
right
in
the
middle
of
what
you
would
call,
it
is
a
sullivan
versus
marchetti
type
of
case
that
is
to
say
or
byers
if
you
please
because
byers
is
a
more
recent
type
of
case.
the
question
really
seems
to
be,
could
mr.
garner
assert
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
at
the
time
he
was
prosecuted
or
did
he
have
to
do
it
at
the
time
that
he
was
filling
out
his
income
tax
return.
the
majority
of
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
indicate
in
--
in
my
opinion
or
rather
simplistic
fashion
that
he
had
to
do
it
at
the
time
he
filled
out
his
return,
even
though
he
may
or
may
not
have
known
at
the
time
he
filled
it
out
that
the
--
that
the
answers
were
incriminating
or
might
be
incriminating.
according
to
judge
wallace
of
the
ninth
circuit,
only
mr.
garner
would
know
whether
his
answers
were
incriminating
at
the
time
he
answered
the
question.
well,
being
a
gambler
is
not
an
incriminating
answer.
being
a
person
who
makes
his
wages
through
gambling
or
makes
his
income
through
gambling
is
not
incriminating.
it
became
incriminating
when
mr.
garner’s
income
tax
returns
were
presented
to
the
court
and
to
the
jury
and
certain
inferences
were
raised
and
argued
by
the
prosecutor
that
these
were
incriminating
circumstances.
that
is
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
he
had
not
even
committed
the
crime.
it
is
like
being
pregnant
or
the
concept
of
being
pregnant.
mr.
garner
would
have
to
have
known
in
1965
that
he
was
thinking,
if
he
was
thinking
of
committing
a
wagering
violation
in
1968.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
that
was
one
of
the
arguments
and
one
of
the
objections
that
was
raised
and
there
is
a
footnote
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief,
that
there
is
a
subsidiary
question
that
was
just
glossed
over
and
that
is
how
are
these
returns
admissible
in
any
case?
they
are
admissions
--
mr.
burton
marks
correct,
but
we
also
because
haines,
grosso,
and
marchetti
had
just
come
out,
the
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
as
being
applicable
to
the
tax
returns
was
very
vital
and
that
was
an
objection
that
was
raised
and
that
was
what
the
ninth
circuit
finally
landed
on,
that
is
the
important
question
which
is
here.
mr.
burton
marks
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
burton
marks
i
still
think
it
would
have
been
irrelevant
unless
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burton
marks
would
it
be
admissible?
mr.
burton
marks
not
unless
it
was
exactly
at
the
time
in
which
he
was
alleged
to
have
committed
the
crime
and
he
said
to
the
public
at
large,
i
am
a
professional
gambler
and
that
is
my
business.
mr.
burton
marks
then
it
would
be
admissible
as
admission
against
his
interest?
mr.
burton
marks
because
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
the
--
the
regulations
and
the
statute
require
that
he
put
in
truthful
information
and
this
court
in
max
(ph)
versus
u.s.
said,
he
better
put
in
truthful
information
or
he
cannot
assert
the
privilege
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
if
he
had
done
it
--
mr.
burton
marks
well,
the
return
would
not
be
admissible
because
it
would
not
have
any
evidentially
value
i
assume
or
based
on
other
ground
that
i
forget
the
case,
you
could
not
use
the
person’s
assertion
of
the
privilege
against
him
as
an
inference
of
guilt
which
is
a
different
subject
altogether,
but
i
perceive
in
our
case
and
this
is
why
a
very
interesting
proposition,
in
sullivan,
this
court
said
many
years
ago,
you
cannot
take
the
privilege
against
the
whole
tax
return.
in
marchetti
where
the
court
said
and
i
use
certain
quotes;
“where
there
is
an
area
permeated
with
criminal
statutes
where
it
is
obviously
incriminating,
then
the
person
can
assert
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
at
the
earliest
opportunity,
i
mean,
at
the
opportunity
where
it
is
being
prosecuted
to
--
at
trial.
that
was
the
specific
holding
of
marchetti,
no
question
about
it,
asserted
at
trial.
now,
here
we
have
an
intermediate
situation,
but
i
submit
that
it
is
really
no
different.
garner
is
no
different
from
marchetti
because
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
if
you
please
or
the
unconstitutionality,
the
permeation
of
criminal,
criminality
comes
not
from
the
face
of
the
statute
which
is
fair,
but
either
from
its
application
by
the
government
which
admittedly
uses
tax
returns
for
any
purpose
at
once
in
a
tax
case
or
a
non-tax
case.
in
the
appendix
and
in
the
government
regulations,
the
internal
revenue
is
26
cfr
which
is
cited
in
the
quote,
that
is
all
the
government
attorney
has
to
do.
the
youngest
u.s.
attorney,
assistant
us
attorney
has
to
do
is
write
a
letter
to
the
department
--
the
internal
revenue
service
and
say,
i
want
a
copy
of
the
--
of
the
tax
return
of
mr.
garner
and
it
is
necessary,
that
is
the
only
word
he
has
to
use,
it
is
necessary
for
my
investigation
and
he
gets
it.
now,
the
proposition
is
that
the
government
and
the
government
says
in
their
brief,
if
you
deprive
us
of
our
right
to
go
into
a
person’s
confidential
tax
returns,
you
are
hampering
government
investigation
and
what
it
means
simply
is
that
the
minute
mr.
garner
becomes
a
subject
of
investigation
according
to
the
governor's
--
government’s
theory,
he
becomes
a
suspect
for
any
type
of
criminal
activity
and
he
is
fair
game
for
complete
government
investigation
and
complete
going
into
his
tax
returns,
and
therefore,
the
government,
by
writing
a
letter
can
circumvent
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
requirements
of
boyd
versus
the
u.s.
they
send
the
letter
and
they
say,
we
want
the
income
tax
return
then
they
have
the
income
tax
return
and
under
calandra
just
recently
decided,
throw
it
into
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
has
this
information
that
they
can
use.
mr.
garner
cannot
object.
how
does
--
why
does
not
the
government
have
to
show
probable
cause
to
get
a
copy
of
mr.
garner’s
tax
return
and
if
he
does
need
probable
cause,
then
are
not
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
government
equally
unconstitutional
on
their
face,
that
is
to
say,
they
do
not
--
they
--
they
are
not
in
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
government
attorney
in
this
case
should
never
have
been
permitted
to
get
the
tax
returns
in
the
first
place
in
a
non-tax
related
case.
and
there
is
where
the
evil
comes
and
that
is
why
this
is
a
type
case
not
a
sullivan
case
and
that
is
the
reason
why
mr.
garner
can
only
object
at
the
time
when
he
is
faced
with
the
evidence
which
was
presented
against
him
at
trial
because
he
never
had
a
chance
to
object
to
the
use
of
the
evidence
before.
he
would
never
know
that
the
government,
the
u.s.
attorney,
the
fbi
and
if
you
read
the
--
the
regulations
of
the
treasury,
you
would
be
astounded
that
how
many
people
have
access
to
your
tax
returns
and
if
you
recall,
mr.
garner
testified
and
that
is
also
in
the
record.
he
got
up
in
his
defense
and
that
is
the
only
testimony
he
gave,
he
thought
his
tax
returns
were
confidential.
and
i
would
wager
that
if
you
--
you
took
a
prior
to
some
of
the
publicity
that
has
been
coming
out
in
recent
months,
but
if
you
had
taken
a
poll
sometime
before
of
the
citizenry
of
this
country,
they
would
have
assumed
that
they
had
a
sort
of
a
pack
with
the
government.
if
they
report
truthfully
and
honestly
what
--
what
they
have
done,
the
government
is
going
to
withhold
that
information
and
it
is
confidential
and
nobody
else
has
a
right
to
see
it.
if
they
defraud
the
government
in
their
tax
return
then
that
is
their
problem.
then
the
government
has
a
right
to
go
to
the
tax
returns
to
detect
the
fraud,
but
otherwise,
they
do
not.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
get
this
type
of
government
activity
which
turns
a
--
an
innocent
tax
return
fair
on
its
face
into
the
subject
of
constant
investigation,
in
other
words,
the
--
the
person
investigated,
whether
or
not
he
has
been
accused
or
not
accused
is
merely
a
subject
of
investigation
and
his
tax
returns
are
available
to
the
investigators
through
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office
and
this
court
is
aware
of
the
task
force
that
have
the
--
for
instance
the
drug,
person
suspected
of
drug
activities,
they
have
the
internal
revenue
service
working
with
them
so
the
irs
gets
in
and
they
convene
a
grand
jury
specially
for
the
purpose
of
subpoenaing
evidence
that
they
otherwise
could
not
get.
they
use
it
for
investigatory
purposes
and
then
they
turn
the
information
over
to
the
--
to
the
law
enforcement
officials
by
virtue
of
this
grand
jury.
they
have
the
tax
people,
they
have
the
drug
people,
they
have
the
--
the
department
of
justice,
all
working
as
a
team
and
this
is
under
some
philosophies
on
appropriate
method
of
investigating
what
is
happening,
but
to
me,
it
is
discriminatory
enforcement.
it
is
equal
all
over
again,
but
it
is
hidden.
it
is
a
fair
statute.
everybody
has
to
report.
everybody
has
to
state
the
information
truthfully,
but
the
government
has
to
be
fair
also.
they
cannot
take
a
series
of
regulations
and
under
the
guise
of
law
enforcement
or
what
they
would
like
to
have
take
a
statute,
internal
revenue
statutes
and
turn
them
into
investigatory
tools
through
purported
regulations
which
on
their
face
are
violative
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
privacy.
the
government
has
the
right
to
know
certain
information,
but
the
citizen
has
the
right
to
privacy.
mr.
burton
marks
i
believe
that
the
--
the
constitutional
guarantee
is
there
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments.
it
is
the
right
to
privacy,
the
right
not
to
disclose
anything
to
the
government.
if
you
are
compelled
to
disclose
it,
then
there
is
this
constitutional
and
i
call
it
a
sort
of
a
social
pact,
if
the
government
says
we
want
information
from
you,
you
must
give
it
to
us,
the
citizen
has
the
right
to
expect
that
the
government
will
not
use
that
information
against
the
citizen
unless
the
citizen
has
defrauded
or
violated
the
pact
with
the
government
and
produced
untruthful
information.
mr.
burton
marks
well
frankly,
i
--
i
have
--
grand
juries
i
would
--
could
accept
calandra
except
for
the
fact
that
they
are
controlled
by
the
united
states
attorney’s
office.
mr.
burton
marks
yes,
but
there
is
this
one
protection
that
the
citizen
has
to
raise
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
burton
marks
right,
and
in
this
case,
congress
has
said
in
effect
or
it
seems
to
be
the
congress
said
in
effect
and
also
so
has
the
internal
revenue
service
that
you
must
answer
every
question
on
the
return
and
you
must
answer
truthfully
and
as
in
garner’s
case
when
he
did
in
fact
assert
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
the
internal
revenue
service
sent
back
a
letter
and
said
your
returns
are
incomplete.
so
by
definition,
we
will
not
let
you
file
the
return
and
you
become
a
felon.
and
that
is
the
vice
where
you
allow
the
government
not
only
to
--
to
be
the
judge,
but
the
--
the
jury
and
all
those
things
as
to
when
the
privilege
can
be
asserted,
that
is
where
the
--
the
majority
is
wrong
in
the
ninth
circuit.
garner
is
not
the
judge
of
what
is
privileged
or
not
privileged,
neither
is
the
government.
what
is
privileged
or
not
privileged
is
judged
by
what
the
use
of
the
material
is
at
the
time
it
is
being
trying
to
be
used
in
a
court
at
the
time
it
is
incriminatory.
in
the
broader
aspects,
as
i
say
i
believe
that
the
way
the
government
is
acting,
the
way
it
is
administering
an
otherwise
fair
statute,
a
reporting
statute
indicates
that
it
is
making
criminal
statutes
and
using
the
internal
revenue
reporting
system
as
a
method
of
enforcing
criminal
statutes
or
investigating
criminal
violations,
something
which
congress
never
intended
to
be
about
to
do
and
something
which
at
least
in
the
process
in
which
it
is
being
done
to
write
a
letter
and
say
i
want
this
person’s
information
without
having
an
affidavit
in
support
of
probable
cause
to
show
that
there
is
reason.
it
is
just
like
king's
warrant
is
broad.
i
want
to
see
what
he
put
on
his
income
tax
report
because
maybe
i
will
find
something
incriminating
because
this
agent
told
me
that
he
did
something
and
so
when
we
look
at
the
tax
returns,
that
is
what
the
government
says
in
page
25
of
their
brief.
if
you
let
this
person
assert
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
if
you
let
them
assert
it
at
the
time
of
trial,
all
this
great
investigation
that
we
are
now
allowed
under
our
own
regulations
will
go
down
the
tubes.
we
cannot
use
it
because
we
sure
need
it
because
gee
wiz
we
sure
need
it.
mr.
burton
marks
actually
that
is
all
what
we
are
really
talking
about
and
if
marchetti
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes,
but
how
do
they
get
then
into
the
courtroom?
there
is
the
(voice
overlap)
question.
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
the
--
the
specific
question
here
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
i
could
have
objected
it.
mr.
burton
marks
because
--
mr.
burton
marks
oh!
it
is,
because
if
you
are
--
if
you
are
going
to
take
the
sullivan-bayer’s
approach
that
there
was
nothing
incriminating
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement
then
you
--
and
there
is
nothing
involved
in
the
--
in
a
permeated
criminal
statute
then
garner
never
had
a
right
to
raise
the
fifth
amendment
objection
at
the
time
of
trial.
and
say
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
statutes
are
used,
you
--
you
get
a
discriminatory
enforcement
so
that
they
are
unfair
as
applied
rather
than
unfair
--
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
right
but
–
mr.
burton
marks
because
the
majority
said
he
could
not
raise
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
at
trial.
he
had
to
raise
it
at
the
time
he
filled
out
his
reports.
mr.
burton
marks
and
i
am
analogizing
this
to
marchetti
in
the
sense
that
the
statute
and
the
way
that
the
income
tax
reporting
statute
is
being
used
is
discriminatory,
therefore,
unconstitutional,
therefore,
the
fifth
amendment
applies
as
well
as
it
did
in
marchetti
because
you
are
permeated
with
government
use
of
--
unlawful
use
of
the
statute.
may
i
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
burton
marks
they
were
compelled.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
sullivan,
again
i
have
to
say,
sullivan
was
in
1925.
mr.
burton
marks
alright.
we
do
not
know
what
questions
were
raised
at
the
time
sullivan
was
involved.
we
do
not
know
where
they
had
distinctions
between
gambling
income,
non-gambling
income,
what
the
tax
consequences
were
if
mr.
garner
were
to
--
whether
or
not
he
really
even
had
to
state
his
occupation.
i
do
not
know
in
1925,
i
was
not
around.
the
point
is
that
–
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
right.
it
turns
out
that
mr.
garner
was
compelled
to
answer
each
and
every
question
because
each
and
every
question
was
determined
by
the
government,
the
internal
revenue
service
to
have
some
bearing
on
the
computation
of
tax.
he
has
to
answer
them
and
he
has
to
answer
him
truthfully.
it
is
compelled.
there
are
some
cases
that
say,
you
cannot
even
--
sullivan
just
dealt
with
the
entire
return.
mr.
garner
never
refused
to
answer
the
return.
marchetti
refused
to
file
the
entire
return
so
you
have
something
right
in
the
middle
here
and
that
is,
i
say
that
mr.
garner
was
compelled.
and
we
have
evidence
that
he
was
compelled
because
when
he
attempted
to
assert
his
privilege
in
filing
a
partial
return,
the
internal
revenue
service
said
it
is
no
good
and
if
you
do
not
file
a
complete
return,
you
are
going
to
be
prosecuted
for
a
felony,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
compulsion.
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
right.
in
the
first
--
1965,
he
said
my
return
--
my
profession
is
wagering,
professional
gambler.
in
1966
and
1967,
he
said
a
horseman,
but
his
--
when
they
asked
him
the
source
of
his
income
in
1966
and
1967,
he
said
wagering
income
income
and
mr.
ulman,
the
trial
attorney
used
that
in
his
argument
which
is
at
page
58
of
the
appendix
to
prove
to
the
jury
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
betting
and
wagering
to
--
and
to
establish
if
you
will
an
element
of
the
offense
from
the
mouth
of
mr.
garner
from
prior
years.
thank
you.
may
i
reserve
the
time?
mr.
burton
marks
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
government
i
think
wants
too
much.
the
government
not
only
wants
full
use
of
the
information
in
the
income
tax
return,
but
it
also
wants
this
court
to
hold
that
there
could
be
no
assertion
of
privilege
perhaps
except
as
to
the
source.
i
would
like
point
out
to
--
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
dangers
inherent
in
that
type
of
approach
where
we
have
today
--
mr.
burton
marks
alright,
i
will
pass
it.
well
--
mr.
burton
marks
right.
i
think
the
question
of
testimonial
compulsion
is
a
false
issue
because
in
my
opinion,
testimonial
compulsion
occurs
when
its
testimony,
when
it
is
being
used
as
evidence.
in
this
case,
statements
of
garner
were
being
introduced
at
trial
as
testimony
or
admissions
against
him
and
whether
you
want
to
call
it
the
testimonial
compulsion
because
he
testified
or
did
not
testify,
i
think
is
begging
the
issue.
these
are
statements
that
he
made.
statements
that
were
compelled
and
they
are
not
testimony.
they
were
just
statements.
they
were
admissions
against
interest
which
perhaps
were
not
when
they
made
them,
but
they
certainly
turn
out
to
be
when
the
government
wanted
to
use
them
against
his
interest.
now
the
case
cited
by
counsel
--
mr.
burton
marks
the
compulsion
was
applied
in
the
first
instance
by
the
statute,
in
the
second
instance
when
they
were
used
or
attempted
to
be
introduced
to
trial.
mr.
burton
marks
that
he
made
--
mr.
burton
marks
yes,
but
under
a
different
theory.
i
think
at
that
point
you
get
into
this
privacy
right
because
he
supplied
this
information
to
the
government
as
testified
to
him
under
the
assumption
that
what
he
supplied
to
them
was
confidential
and
will
not
be
disclosed,
will
not
be
used
against
him.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
kordel
is
different
because
in
kordel,
the
civil
proceedings
were
right
at
the
same
time,
the
criminal
proceedings
were
and
kordel
if
he
was
not
smart
enough
to
know
that
he
could
assert
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
during
the
criminal
--
civil
proceeding
when
he
was
having
criminal
proceedings
against
him,
then
that
is
his
tough
luck.
here,
garner
did
not
have
anything
against
him.
mr.
burton
marks
[laughter]i
would
not
say
it,
but
i
think
he
was.
mr.
burton
marks
well,
to
whatever
extent
you
want
to
rely
on
monia,
i
believe
that
it
is
wrong
where
the
question
of
waiver
may
or
may
not
be
involved.
that
is
the
reason
that
the
government
is
avoiding
the
question
of
waiver
because
it
has
to
be
knowing,
you
have
to
know
when
you
want
to
assert
something.
mr.
burton
marks
it
is
wrong.
mr.
burton
marks
that
is
right.
mr.
burton
marks
the
government
refused
to
discuss
the
waiver
question
because
if
you
get
into
knowing
waivers
--
mr.
burton
marks
it
is
involved
because
a
person
cannot
have
a
privilege
--
mr.
burton
marks
if
a
person
has
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
--
mr.
burton
marks
but
if
he
does
not
know
that
he
is
incriminating
himself
and
then
at
a
later
point
it
turns
out
that
he
was,
he
has
a
right
to
assert
his
privilege.
that
is
my
opinion.
mr.
burton
marks
no,
it
is
not.
[laughter]thank
you.
