justice
potter
stewart
but
really
all
that
is
in
here
is
the
admissibility
in
evidence
at
the
trial
of
the
tax
return,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
tax
returns
could
be
used
for
investigation
is
another
subject
in
other
day,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
involved
here
is
the
admissibility
in
evidence
at
this
trial
or
the
tax
returns
itself,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
do
not
think,
why
do
you
need
to
take
on
the
question
of
the
use
of
tax
returns
in
preliminary
investigation
by
government
agency?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
said,
you
correct
me
if
am
wrong,
but
i
thought
you
said
that
i
was
correct
in
my
understanding
that
what
it
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
admissibility
in
evidence
that
this
person
at
your
client’s
trial
of
his
previous
tax
returns?
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
is
there
involved
here
any
of
the
questions
that
you
have
talked
about
involving
the
confidentiality
of
the
person's
tax
returns?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
issue,
whether
or
not
he
was
too
late,
when
at
trial,
he
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
the
tax
return,
that
is
the
issue,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
form
and
his
question
asking
(voice
overlap)
you
do
not
know?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
availability
of
a
person’s
tax
returns
to
agencies
other
than
the
internal
revenue
bureau,
all
covered
specifically
and
authorized
by
statute
or
is
it
a
matter
of
regulation
or
just
an
inter
agency
understanding
and
agreements?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
now
mr.
jones,
how
do
you
reconcile
what
you
are
telling
us
now
with
the
experience
that
this
taxpayer
had
with
respect
to
this
1973
return?
justice
potter
stewart
with
an
explanatory
letter?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
with
the
criminal
prosecution
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
taxpayer
was
a
resident
of
nevada,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
1973?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
not
be
incriminating
in
certain
states
to
show
professionalism?
your
occupation
was
professional
gambler?
justice
stewart
disclosures
were
though
self-incrimination
at
the
time
the
disclosure
was
made?
justice
potter
stewart
you
did
address
the
first
two
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
we
would
not
need
to
decide
(voice
overlap)
on
either
one
of
them,
you
would
not
get
to
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
court
of
appeals
address
your
point
of
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
is
it,
i
mean,
whatever
they
will
come
out,
that
is
not
issue,
but
maybe
some
other
day?
justice
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise,
you
run
into
the
monia
case
or
the
kordel
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
monia
stands
--
monia
stands
the
same
proposition
even
more
clearly
perhaps
in
kordel
and
a
witness
testifies
as
a
third
party
witness
and
does
not
tie
in
his
constitutional
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
that
testimony
can
later
be
used
against
him
at
his
criminal
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
such
privilege.
if
the
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
monia,
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
ir
was
all
withdrawn
on
the
rehearing?
justice
potter
stewart
the
original
claims
were
all
withdrawn?
