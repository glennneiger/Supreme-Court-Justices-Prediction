justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
marks
before
you
sit
down,
before
you
reach
the
ultimate
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
posting,
do
you
not
have
a
threshold
question
that
is
critical
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
responses
in
the
return
that
can
send
you
were
compelled
in
a
fifth
amendment
sense?
as
i
read
sullivan,
they
were
not
compelled.
i
take
it
you
take
a
different
view,
but
i
would
like
to
hear
you
discuss
that.
if
they
were
not
compelled,
that
comes
pretty
close
to
answer
--
answering
the
question
put
to
you
by
mr.
justice
stewart?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
why
in
light
of
--
in
light
of
what
sullivan
said?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner
revealed,
in
his
federal
income
tax
returns
that
he
was
a
professional
gambler.
he
was
subsequently
indicted
and
tried
on
a
gambling
conspiracy
charge.
his
returns
were
introduced
in
evidence
despite
his
fifth
amendment
claim
of
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
that
petitioner
had
voluntarily
revealed
his
status
as
a
gambler.
although
he
was
compelled
by
law
to
file
the
tax
returns,
he
could
have
claimed
the
privilege
with
respect
specific
disclosures
at
the
time
of
filing.
in
these
circumstance,
we
think
the
general
rule
applies,
that
privilege
must
be
claimed
prior
to
disclosure
in
the
absence
of
some
factor
that
deprives
the
individual
of
a
free
choice.
as
there
was
no
such
factor
in
this
case,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
justice
marshall
filed
an
opinion,
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
