mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
and
the
only
issue
that
i
am
likely
to
have
time
to
discuss
at
any
length
is
the
issue
to
which
mr.
marks
has
addressed
to
all
of
his
attention,
that
is
whether
a
taxpayer
has
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
exclude
from
evidence
in
a
subsequent
non-tax
criminal
proceeding
his
prior
federal
income
returns.
for
analytical
purposes
in
this
case,
we
have
subdivided
this
principal
issue
into
two
separate
questions.
first
of
these
is
to
in
what
circumstances
if
any
the
disclosures
on
a
taxpayer’s
income
tax
return
maybe
said
to
be
compelled
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
the
second
question
is
to
what
extent
if
any
does
the
fifth
amendment
require
the
imposition
of
used
immunity
with
respect
to
disclosures
that
have
in
fact
been
compelled
under
the
federal
income
tax
laws.
i
will
address
each
of
these
questions
in
turn,
but
with
major
emphasis
on
our
contention
that
testimony
or
compulsion
was
lacking
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
before
i
take
up
these
questions
however,
i
would
like
to
at
least
allude
briefly
to
the
significance
of
this
case
to
the
administration
of
the
tax
and
non-tax
criminal
laws.
our
underlying
concern
in
this
case
is
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
in
accordance
with
petitioner’s
arguments
here
that
a
taxpayer’s
disclosure
is
on
his
return
are
entitled
to
automatic
use
immunity,
then
in
any
non-tax
criminal
proceeding,
a
prosecutor
would
be
subjected
to
the
heavy
burden
of
disproving
taint
in
any
case
in
which
he
had
an
occasion
to
review
the
defendant’s
tax
returns
and
those
might
well
be
a
fairly
large
number
of
cases.
as
we
explained
in
our
brief
at
greater
length,
pages
22
to
27,
there
are
many
situations
in
which
a
prosecutor
may
have
occasion
to
review
a
defendant’s
tax
return.
the
easiest
ones
were
envision
as
the
case
where
taxpayer’s
returns
have
been
forwarded
to
the
u.s.
attorney
by
the
internal
revenue
service
with
a
request
that
the
defendant
be
prosecuted
for
tax
crimes.
if
a
defendant
has
also
been
under
investigation
for
non-tax
offenses,
the
non-tax
proceedings
will
then
be
subjected
to
inquiries
obtained
to
turn
whether
any
of
the
evidence
has
been
derived
from
the
taxpayer’s
returns.
and
there
may
be
many
other
situations
in
which
there
are
incidental
exchanges
of
information
between
the
internal
revenue
service
and
department
of
justice
which
may
give
rise
to
claims
obtained
if
there
were
was
an
automatic
used
immunity.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
suggested
that
that
issue
was
not
really
involved
in
this
case
because
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
the
possibility
of
an
application
of
the
“fruits”
doctrine
whereas
all
that
is
at
issue
here
is
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
the
tax
returns
themselves.
but
looking
into
the
future,
we
might
find
it
difficult
if
there
were
automatic
used
immunity
as
to
the
returns
to
distinguish
cases
like
counselman
against
hitchcock
and
kastigar
which
do
require
immunity
from
uses
--
from
indirect
as
well
as
direct
use
of
the
compelled
disclosures.
these
underlying
considerations
practicality
or
as
i
say
spelled
out
in
our
brief
and
i
will
not
enlarge
it
further
upon
them
here,
but
i
think
that
they
are
important
considerations
that
should
play
a
significant
role
in
the
court’s
analysis
of
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
president
must
authorize
and
has
done
so
through
regulations.
the
use
of
tax
returns
outside
the
internal
revenue
service.
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
pertinent
regulations
that
permit
the
department
of
justice
to
have
access
to
the
returns
in
connection.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
am
now
looking
at
the
index
and
we
cite
those
regulations
apparently
on
pages
25
and
36
of
our
brief.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
regulation
provides
that
the
department
of
justice
and
the
united
states
attorney’s
have
the
right
to
inspect
the
taxpayers'
return
“for
necessary
in
the
performance
of
official
duty,”
so
that
they
do
have
access
within
the
limits
of
that
regulation.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
cannot
answer
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
guess
so.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
would
not
think
so
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
this
anticipates
that
it
would
only
be
the
united
states
attorney
or
perhaps
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
with
his
authorization.
that
is
what
the
lawyers
would
have
access.
that
is
correct,
if
the
united
states
attorney
authorized
it.
i
am
not
sure
how?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
--
we
do
not
quote
full
text
of
the
regulation
here,
but
we
do
say
that
the
united
states
attorneys
by
regulation
have
the
right
to
inspect
the
return.
i
think
that
they
would
have
to
authorize
a
request
from
an
assistant
united
states
attorney.
that
is
my
understanding
at
any
rate.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
may
well
be,
i
am
not
sure
what
bearing
that
has
on
the
construction
of
this
regulation
and
i
am
not
sure
just
what
the
exact
terms
of
the
regulation
are.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct,
but
there
is
broad
access
for
purposes
of
investigation
of
criminal
activities.
with
these
general
thoughts
in
the
background,
i
will
turn
now
to
the
discussion
of
the
question
of
testimonial
compulsion.
and
in
approaching
this
question
that
is
helpful
at
the
outset
to
describe
with
some
clarity
the
legal
setting
in
which
a
taxpayer
completes
and
files
his
internal
--
his
income
tax
return.
the
taxing
statutes
require
that
the
taxpayer
provide
all
the
information
requested
on
the
return
and
a
taxpayer
must,
subject
to
penalties
for
perjury,
attest
by
his
signature
that
the
answers
on
his
return
are
accurate
and
complete.
and
a
willful
failure
to
file
a
complete
return
subjects
the
taxpayer
to
prosecution
for
a
misdemeanor
under
section
7203
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
petitioner
and
the
dissenters
in
the
court
of
appeals
perceive
the
statutory
scheme
as
exerting
testimonial
compulsion
upon
the
taxpayer
to
incriminate
itself.
they
reasoned
that
any
refusal
by
the
taxpayer
to
complete
his
returns
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
would
subject
him
to
prosecution
for
failure
to
file
a
return
under
section
7203
and
that
threat
of
prosecution
would
be
sufficient
to
induce
a
taxpayer
to
forgo
a
valid
claim
of
privilege
and
thereby
to
compel
self-incrimination.
now,
we
believe
that
this
conclusion
reached
by
the
petitioner
and
the
dissenters
below
is
based
upon
a
fundamentally
mistaken
understanding
of
the
scope
of
section
7203
and
an
equally
mistaken
understanding
of
the
pertinent
constitutional
principles
that
apply
here.
section
7203
punishes
only
a
willful
failure
to
file0
and
the
concept
of
willfulness
is
crucial
in
this
case.
under
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
bishop,
a
taxpayer
cannot
be
convicted
of
a
willful
failure
to
file
unless
his
failure
represents
a
voluntary
and
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty.
and
a
taxpayer
who
believes
that
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
justifies
his
refusal
to
provide
an
answer
on
a
federal
income
tax
return
cannot
be
shown
to
have
violated
a
known
legal
duty
within
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
in
the
bishop
case
because
such
a
taxpayer
by
hypothesis
has
a
good
faith
belief
that
his
statutory
duty
to
provide
information
has
been
constitutionally
excused.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
reconcile
that.
what
happened
was
that
he
filed
a
return
asserting
broad
claims
of
privilege
and
his
service
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
with
an
explanatory
letter.
the
service
determined
that
that
was
not
a
completed
return
as
required.
at
that
point,
i
will
leap
ahead
in
my
argument
here
to
spell
out
at
some
length
what
procedures
were
available
to
the
secretary
and
what
this
letter
represents.
if
a
taxpayer
asserts
a
claim
of
privilege
on
a
return,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
service
to
secure
the
information
necessary
to
complete
the
return
and
to
determine
the
amount
of
tax
due.
and
it
does
this
first
through
informal
mechanisms
by
sending
the
taxpayer
letters
such
as
it
was
sent
to
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is
fair
to
say
it
was
threatening
him
with
prosecution,
but
pointing
out
that
a
failure
to
provide
might
subject
him
as
indeed
it
might
if
his
claim
of
privilege
was
invalid
and
in
bad
faith
to
a
criminal
prosecution.
if
the
taxpayer
continued
to
assert
his
claim
of
privilege
in
informal
conferences,
the
internal
revenue
service
if
it
determined
that
the
privilege
was
not
available
could
issue
to
him
administrative
summons
requesting
that
he
furnish
the
information.
and
if
a
taxpayer
continued
to
assert
his
privilege
as
a
basis
for
refusing
to
comply
with
the
summons,
the
service
will
then
be
required
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
summons
in
a
district
court.
and
at
that
point,
the
taxpayer
would
have
--
would
be
entitled
to
an
adjudication
of
his
claim
of
privilege.
if
the
district
court
recognized
the
claim
of
privilege,
determined
it
to
be
valid,
well
then
it
would
refuse
enforcement
of
the
summons.
at
that
point,
the
service
would
in
order
to
secure
the
information
have
to
award
the
taxpayer
immunity
under
18
u.s.c.
6004
and
with
the
award
of
immunity
of
course,
the
taxpayer
could
be
ordered
to
provide
the
information
sought
in
the
summons.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
district
court
determined
that
the
claim
of
privilege
was
not
valid,
it
could
order
enforcement
of
the
summons
without
an
accompanying
ground
of
immunity.
but
in
either
case,
the
taxpayer
is
subjected
to
compulsion
only
at
the
time
the
summons
is
ordered
enforced
and
not
before.
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
never
asserted
this
claim
of
privilege,
he
never
invoked
his
administrative
process,
a
fortiori
he
was
not
compelled
to
disclose
information
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
go
back
to
the
processes
that
would
operate
if
the
service
determined
that
the
taxpayer’s
claims
of
privilege
were
in
bad
faith.
at
that
time,
if
it
secured
out
of
good
information
on
its
own
to
determine
the
taxpayer’s
liability
or
that
there
was
sufficient
information
from
which
it
can
conclude
that
the
claim
of
privilege
was
invalid
and
they
are
all
by
the
way
in
many
cases
involving
invalid
claims
of
privilege
by
taxpayers
who
wish
to
assert
such
a
claim
of
privilege
as
a
basis
for
not
filing
a
return
at
all.
now,
the
service
could
then
bring
a
prosecution,
but
as
i
pointed
out,
that
prosecution
could
be
successful
only
if
it
was
established
not
only
that
the
taxpayers
claim
of
privilege
was
invalid,
but
also
that
the
taxpayer
knew
that
it
was
invalid
and
that
he
was
making
it
in
bad
faith
merely
as
a
means
of
avoiding
payment
of
his
federal
income
tax
liability.
in
other
words,
the
sanctions
imposed
by
the
threat
of
a
prosecution
under
section
7203
places
no
burden
on
the
exercise
of
a
valid
claim
of
privilege
or
even
upon
a
claim
privilege
of
the
taxpayer
erroneously
believes
to
be
valid.
and
therefore,
section
7203,
the
enforcement
mechanism
in
the
code,
does
not
coerce
the
taxpayer
into
foregoing
a
claim
that
he
believes
to
be
valid.
it
does
not
compel
a
taxpayer
to
incriminate
himself.
we
think
that
this
analysis
is
buttressed
by
this
court’s
prior
decisions
under
the
fifth
amendment.
in
particular,
the
situation
of
a
taxpayer
completing
his
return
maybe
fairly
analogized
to
that
of
a
witness
in
a
civil
proceeding.
both
the
taxpayer
and
the
witness
are
confronted
with
authoritative
directives
to
furnish
information.
i
have
already
outlined
the
directives
that
are
addressed
to
the
taxpayer
and
those
that
are
addressed
to
the
witness
are
very
similar.
often,
the
witness
will
be
--
having
summoned
by
legal
process
to
appear
and
give
testimony
and
at
the
time
of
giving
testimony,
he
is
required
to
affirm,
subject
to
the
penalties
for
perjury
that
he
will
tell
the
whole
truth
and
if
necessary,
the
judge
will
instruct
him
that
he
has
a
duty
to
provide
evidence
and
that
his
refusal
to
do
so
may
subject
him
to
the
punishment
of
contempt.
in
other
words,
the
judge
may,
like
the
service
in
the
case
of
the
petitioner,
threaten
the
witness
with
the
possibility
of
punishment
if
the
information
is
not
forthcoming.
the
circumstances
therefore,
faced
by
a
taxpayer
and
a
witness
are
not
identical,
certainly
closely
comparable.
we
believe
that
the
same
constitutional
rule
should
apply
in
each
case.
the
rule
for
witnesses
is
clear.
this
court
has
held
and
reaffirmed
in
a
number
of
cases,
most
recently
in
united
states
against
kordel
that
self-incriminatory
testimony
given
by
a
witness
in
an
ordinary
civil
proceeding
may
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
trial.
the
reason
for
this
rule
or
the
basis
for
this
rule
is
set
forth
and
explained
by
the
court
and
in
the
case
called
united
states
against
monia,
and
i
think
that
is
the
pronunciation
of
it,
m-o-n-i-a
and
we
quote
from
that
opinion
on
page
15
and
i
would
like
to
repeat
it
because
it
bears
directly
upon
are
case
as
well.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
page
15
of
our
brief.
i
am
just
quoting
from
the
court’s
decision
in
the
monia
case
where
the
court
stated
the
amendment
speaks
of
compulsion.
it
does
not
preclude
a
witness
from
testifying
voluntarily
in
matters
which
may
incriminate
him.
if
therefore,
he
desires
the
protection
of
the
privilege,
he
must
claim
it
or
he
will
not
be
considered
to
have
been
compelled
within
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
and
that
is
our
contention
here.
the
taxpayer
does
not
assert
his
privilege.
he
does
not
claim
his
privilege.
he
cannot
be
considered
to
who
have
been
compelled
at
the
time
of
completing
of
filing
his
return.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
right.
we
do
not
discuss
this
case
at
all
in
terms
of
waiver,
but
merely
in
terms
of
the
absence
of
testimonial
compulsion
which
i
think
is
the
way
this
court
has
analyzed
analogous
cases
in
the
past.
precisely
the
same
consideration
should
govern
this
case
as
well
as
the
case
of
the
witness
in
the
ordinary
civil
proceeding.
although
a
taxpayer
is
under
some
official
pressure
to
complete
and
file
this
tax
return,
pressure
such
as
the
letter
that
you
have
mentioned
mr.
justice
stewart,
just
as
a
witness
is
subject
to
some
official
pressure
to
testify.
the
crucial
point
in
each
case
is
that
the
pressure
is
not
such
as
would
override
or
nullify
a
valid,
timely
asserted
claim
of
privilege.
in
neither
situation
is
the
sanction
oppose
upon
the
taxpayer
or
the
witness
for
asserting
a
valid
claim
of
privilege.
thus
in
neither
situation
can
answers
furnished
without
any
claim
of
privilege
be
treated
as
having
been
compelled
within
the
meeting
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
this
conclusion
we
think
is
further
supported
by
contrasting
this
situation
with
those
in
which
this
court
has
found
testimonial
compulsion
in
the
past.and
perhaps
the
most
pertinent
example
is
the
case
of
the
garrity
against
new
jersey.
in
that
case,
a
police
officer
was
informed
that
--
was
requested
to
testify
in
an
inquiry
into
alleged
traffic
ticket
fixing
and
he
was
informed
that
if
he
refused
to
testify
that
he
would
be
removed
from
his
office.
and
under
this
threat,
the
policeman
did
testify
and
in
doing
so
he
incriminated
himself.
the
incriminatory
disclosures
were
then
introduced
in
evidence
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
arising
out
of
the
inquiry.
this
court
determined
that
those
disclosures
were
not
admissible
against
the
policeman
in
his
trial,
reasoning
that
the
policeman’s
desire
to
remain
silent
had
been
overborne
by
the
threat
of
a
severe
economic
sanction
placed
upon
the
very
exercise
of
a
valid
claim
of
privilege.
in
other
words,
in
that
case
if
the
policeman
in
garrity
had
claimed
his
privilege,
he
still
would
have
been
subject
to
the
sanction
of
removal
from
office.
in
this
case,
if
the
petitioner
had
claimed
this
privilege,
he
would
have
been
subject
to
no
such
sanction.
even
if
his
claim
of
privilege
i
might
add
and
reiterate
was
invalid
so
long
as
he
in
good
faith
believed
it
to
be
a
valid
one.
accordingly,
unlike
garrity,
we
believe
that
the
policeman
in
this
case,
excuse
me,
the
taxpayer
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
not
subject
to
any
compulsion
to
incriminate
himself.
before
going
on
to
the
second
question
that
i
have
raised,
i
would
like
to
further
point
out
that
even
if
in
this
case,
this
line
of
reasoning
was
rejected
and
it
was
concluded
that
the
directives
addressed
to
a
taxpayer
at
the
time
that
he
completes
and
files
his
return,
do
represent
testimonial
compulsion.
there
is
no
compulsion
upon
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
incriminate
himself.
as
we
explained
in
footnote
13
of
our
brief
on
page
23,
the
disclosures
made
by
the
petitioner
on
his
tax
returns
as
mr.
marks
has
conceded
here
were
not
incriminating
when
made
and
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
only
protects
against
the
compelled
disclosure
of
self-incriminatory
information.
it
does
not
protect
against
the
compelled
disclosure
of
information
that
is
not
incriminating,
but
that
only
becomes
incriminating
because
of
the
subsequent
criminal
activities
of
the
witness
so
that
in
this
case,
even
if
it
were
found
that
in
that
testimonial
compulsion
is
present,
there
was
no
testimonial
compulsion
to
incriminate
in
this
case.
i
would
also
mention
that
the
kinds
of
disclosures
that
were
made
here
were
not
such
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
that
i
think
is
at
pages
42
to
45
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
those
answers
did
not
themselves
constitute
the
admission
of
any
criminality
nor
did
they
form
a
link
in
a
chain
of
evidence
with
regard
to
any
crime
that
we
know
of
as
of
the
date
that
the
tax
returns
were
completed.
the
conspiracy
for
which
the
petitioner
was
prosecuted
for
his
participation
in
it
began
in
may
of
1968.
his
last
tax
return
that
was
introduced
in
this
trial
was
filed
in
april
of
1968
for
the
preceding
year
of
1967
so
that
there
were
no
self-incriminatory
disclosures
made
on
this
taxpayer’s
return
whether
or
not
he
was
subject
to
testimonial
compulsion.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
a
resident
of
nevada
at
that
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
however,
he
now
is
a
resident
of
nevada.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
believe
at
the
time
this
taxpayer
resided
in
california
--
his
tax
returns
are
in
the
appendix.
yes,
in
the
case
that
at
the
time
his
returns
were
filed
he
was
a
resident
of
california,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
under
california
law
it
would
be
illegal
to
be
a
gambler
if
you
are
gambling
activities
in
fact
were
taking
place
in
nevada
or
indeed,
there
may
well
be
gambling
activities
in
california
they
can
be
engaged
in.
at
any
rate,
there
is
no
allegation
here
by
petitioner
that
those
answers
were
incriminating
when
made
and
indeed
as
i
indicated
earlier,
mr.
marks
has
conceded
that
they
were
not
in
fact
incriminating.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
would
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
by
that
i
think
we
meant
that
potential
for
incrimination
means
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
have
to
--
that
any
person
asserting
a
claim
of
privilege
does
not
have
to
show
actual
incrimination,
but
only
the
potential
of
incrimination,
if
his
answer
provided
and
all
we
meant
to
say
was
that
situation
at
the
time
of
filing
the
return
has
to
be
the
same
as
the
time
of
subsequent
use.
i
turn
now
to
the
second
question
that
i
undertook
to
address
at
the
beginning
of
this
argument
which
is
to
what
extent,
if
any,
the
fifth
amendment
requires
the
imposition
of
use
immunity
with
respect
to
disclosures
that
have
in
fact
been
compelled
under
the
federal
income
tax
laws.
time
does
not
permit
a
full
discussion
of
this
issue
and
i
can
do
a
little
more
than
outline
the
arguments
that
we
set
forth
at
some
length
at
pages
27
to
41
of
our
brief.
but
we
suggest
there
that
in
the
context
of
the
neutral
self-reporting
requirements
of
the
federal
income
tax
laws,
the
fifth
amendment
requires
the
imposition
of
use
immunity
only
with
respect
to
those
compelled
disclosures
that
constitute
or
that
entail
a
substantial
risk
of
prosecution
and
that
the
only
disclosures
on
a
tax
return
that
entail
such
a
risk
are
those
involve
a
direct
admission
of
criminality
when
made.
relevantly
obnoxious
disclosures
that
the
petitioner
made
on
his
tax
returns
in
this
case
clearly
do
not
need
that
test.
these
disclosures
that
he
was
a
gambler,
that
he
made
money
as
a
gambler
were
not
admissions
of
criminality
as
such.
now,
our
suggestion
along
these
lines,
draws
in
large
part
from
this
court’s
decision
in
california
against
byers,
in
which
it
was
held
that
a
driver
involved
in
an
accident
could
be
compelled
under
state
hit
and
run
statute
to
make
certain
disclosures
and
that
those
disclosures
could
be
used
against
the
driver
in
a
subsequent
criminal
proceeding
arising
out
of
the
accident.
although
there
was
no
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case,
both
the
plurality
opinion
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
evidence
a
concern
that
self-reporting
requirements
that
further
a
legitimate,
non-prosecutorial
government
purpose
might
be
substantially
hindered
or
frustrated
by
assertions
of
privilege
based
upon
a
mere
possibility
as
contrasted
with
a
substantial
probability
of
incrimination.
we
think
that
that
concern
is
also
appropriate
here.
under
the
standard
of
incrimination
applicable
in
the
criminal
context,
under
the
so
called
hoffman
test,
propounded
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
against
hoffman,
a
refusal
to
comply
with
a
request
for
information
or
a
refusal
to
testify
may
be
based
upon
even
a
very
attenuated
risk
of
incrimination.
we
fear
that
widespread
refusals
to
answer
questions
on
tax
returns
based
upon
that
relatively
permissive
hoffman
standard
of
incrimination
could
seriously
disrupt
the
administration
of
the
taxing
laws.
now,
if
as
i
have
spelled
out
in
the
earlier
part
of
my
argument,
the
procedure
to
be
invoked
is
one
of
administrative
summons
and
the
determination
of
the
validity
of
claims
of
privilege,
the
administration
of
the
taxing
laws
could
be
seriously
disrupted
by
fraudulent,
invalid
claims
of
privilege
that
require
a
lengthy
administrative
and
judicial
hearing
before
the
information
necessary
is
finally
secured.
if
on
the
other
hand,
a
higher
standard
of
incrimination
is
required
in
the
self-reporting
context
that
we
are
considering
here,
then
it
would
be
clear
what
questions
on
the
return
might
entail
a
substantial
risk
of
prosecution
and
those
which
would
not
and
we
suggest
in
our
brief
that
the
only
questions
on
a
taxpayers
return
that
are
likely,
the
answers
to
which
are
likely
to
entail
a
substantial
risk
of
prosecution
are
those
that
relate
to
the
source
of
miscellaneous
income
or
possibly
occupational
though
that
seem
somewhat
unlikely.
we
feel
that
permitting
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
only
on
the
basis
of
the
higher
standard
of
incrimination
that
we
suggest
would
afford
a
substantial
measure
of
protection
to
all
individual
taxpayers
while
at
the
same
time
not
significantly
impairing
the
government’s
ability
to
secure
and
use
the
information
needs
in
raising
the
revenue.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
you
agree
that
there
is
no
compelled
disclosure
here,
there
is
no
need
to
consider
what
would
be
the
appropriate
result
of
in
fact(voice
overlap)disclosures.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
or
as
we
also
point
out
in
our
brief
if
it
is
determined
that
error,
if
any,
were
harmless
here,
i
have
not
addressed
that
issue,
but
pages,
i
think
42
to
45
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
would
of
course
be
a
way
of
avoiding
the
necessity
of
a
constitutional
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
completed
my
presentation
of
the
government’s
arguments
in
this
case,
but
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
would
be
happy
to
try
to
respond
to
them.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
it
did
not.
not
so
far,
as
i
can
tell
it.
in
that
event,
i
simply
ask
the
court
that
judgment
below
be
affirmed.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
i
do
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
in
the
original
panel
opinion
case,
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
wallace
did
raise
the
question
of
harmless
error,
but
so
far
as
i
can
tell
the
majority
and
the
panel
did
not
reach
it,
and
neither
did
the
court
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
on
rehearing
in
fact
the
only
issue
considered
was
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
