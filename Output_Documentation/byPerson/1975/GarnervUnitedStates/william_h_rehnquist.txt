william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
know
that
i
follow
you
there
mr.
marks.
if
it
was
a
link
in
the
chain
of
causation
at
the
time
that
the
chain
of
inferences
that
would
lead
to
the
judgment
that
a
crime
had
been
committed,
at
the
time
the
prosecutor
was
arguing
it
to
the
jury,
would
it
not
have
been
the
same
at
the
time
he
filed
the
return?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
how
was
the
fact
that
he
admitted
to
being
a
wager
in
1965
incriminating
on
the
charge
that
he
was

did
in
1968?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
explain
grand
juries
under
that
theory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
are
cases
over
a
long
period
of
time
that
said
that
government
has
a
right
to
everybodyâ€™s
testimony.
there
is
no
pact
whatever
that
if
you
tell
the
truth
to
the
grand
jury,
you
will
not
be
indicted.
if
--
your
truthful
testimony
reveals
that
you
have
committed
a
crime?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
what
you
acclaimed
here
is
about
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
monia
does
not
--
monia
says
that
if
you
do
not
claim
your
privileges,
it
is
wrong?
