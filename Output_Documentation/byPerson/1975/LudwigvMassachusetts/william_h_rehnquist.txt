william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
if
massachusetts
wanted
to
--
if
the
motor
vehicle
registrar
wanted
to
suspend
his
driver’s
license
and
not
impose
any
criminal
sanction,
they
would
not
have
to
afford
a
jury
trial
for
that,
would
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
massachusetts
simply
says
that
not
only
as
driving
while
drinking
or
whatever
your
client
may
have
been
charged
with
a
criminal
offense,
but
is
also
a
basis
for
revoking
ones
driver’s
license.
if
the
motor
vehicle
registrar
thinks
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
as
happened
he
will
hold
a
hearing,
the
way
he
holds
other
administrative
hearings
without
any
jury
and
to
suspend
simply
he
needs
a
by
probable
cause
that
it
happened,
anything
wrong
with
that
constitutionally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
did
not
costarelli
last
year
cast
some
doubt
on
your
proposition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
true
but
preliminary
hearing,
preliminary
hearing
does
give
you
a
jury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
callan,
i
noticed
it
does
mention
those
massachusetts'
early
cases.
do
you
think
that
court's
opinion
really
expressly
disapproves
them
or
just
kind
of
puts
them
to
one
side?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
reason
this
is
not
properly
an
appeal
is
because
the
challenge
is
not
to
the
massachusetts
statute,
but
to
the
custom
and
practice
followed
in
the
massachusetts
court
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
this
not
the
reason
that
they
made
it
clear
is
not
because
of
any
provision
of
the
statute,
but
because
of
their
own
ruling
as
to
the
right
of
jury
trial
in
massachusetts
trial
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
a
single
tier
system
if
you
failed
to
make
untimely
demand
for
jury
trial,
you
waive
it?
