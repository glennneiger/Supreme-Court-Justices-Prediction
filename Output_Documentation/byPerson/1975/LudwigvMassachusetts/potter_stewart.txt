justice
potter
stewart
if
he
has
not
been
convicted,
if
you
set
aside,
whatever
the
jury
may
be,
the
law
of
massachusetts
says
that
even
after
it
is
set
aside,
his
license
is
revoked.
is
that
what
you
are
telling?
justice
potter
stewart
whereas
the
law
of
massachusetts
is
that
a
conviction
in
the
district
court,
even
after
it
is
set
aside
in
a
driving
case
of
this
kind,
has
the
collateral
consequence
of
depriving
a
person
of
his
driver’s
license?
justice
potter
stewart
it
really
boils
down,
does
it
not,
to
the
question
of
whether
the
rule
of
duncan
against
louisiana
embraces
the
doctrine
of
callahan
against
callan
against
wilson?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
you
certainly
have
--
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
throw
that
case
aside?
justice
potter
stewart
and
also,
a
double
jeopardy
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
have
those
data
been
published
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
well
settled
massachusetts
law
as
a
matter
of
judicial
construction
of
the
statute,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
what
the
statute
means
because
that
is
what
the
massachusetts
courts
have
said
that
means,
would
that
follow?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
up
to
us
to
construe
the
statute
that
has
been
done
for
us
by
the
massachusetts
court
which
had
made
it
clear
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
at
the
first
tier.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
superior
court
in
every
county
in
massachusetts?
justice
potter
stewart
being
multi-judge?
justice
potter
stewart
some
being
maybe
a
single-judge?
justice
potter
stewart
so
functionally,
that
is
not
unlike
just
the
binding
over
proceeding,
is
that
what
you
are
--?
justice
potter
stewart
alright
and
is
that
practice
availed
of
when
its
clear
that
the
defendant
has
to
go
to
the
superior
court,
it
is
done
only
then?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
almost
by
agreement
that
tradition
is
evolved
that
this
has
been
converted
into
a
traditional
binding
over?
justice
potter
stewart
except
of
course
on
his
record
is
this
conviction
that
is
now
been
set
aside
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
your
brother
told
us
might
have,
in
a
vehicle
case
might
have
the
collateral
consequence
of
the
deprivation
of
the
defendants
driving
license
for
a
period?
justice
potter
stewart
he
does
not
even
need
to
report
to
a
larger
error
in
the
first
trial
in
order
to
go
to
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
by
way
of
it
guilty
and
a
minor
punishment
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
case
and
there
is
no
reason
to
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
irwin,
you
sister
state
of
rhode
island
i
think
has
a
very
similar
not
almost
identical
statutory
system
which
i
understand
has
been
declared
to
be
invalid.
it
was
declared
invalid
by
a
district
court
in
rhode
island
has
now
moved
it
would
adapt
to
the
district
court’s
decree,
am
i
mistaken
in
this?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
does
rhode
island
go
about
it
now?
justice
potter
stewart
as
for
mr.
chief
justice's
question
you
said
at
the
very
outset
that
the
statute
itself
does
not
explicitly
deny
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
first
tier?
justice
potter
stewart
so
presumably
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
is
yes,
massachusetts
could
do
this
without
an
amendment
to
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
the
holiday
case
that
was
cited
in
the
briefs?
i
thought
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
under
rhode
island
93,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
do
about
callan
against
wilson?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
ford
has
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
duncan?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
was
the
maximum
sentence
of
imposable
under
the
offense
for
which
he
was
tried?
justice
potter
stewart
and
one
more
question
while
i
have
interrupted.
i
an
correct,
am
i,
in
my
understanding
that
on
this
trial
de
novo,
first
of
all
will
the
jury
know
or
will
not
know
about
the
first
trial
on
the
first
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
a
waiver
of
the
jury,
will
the
judge
know?
justice
potter
stewart
as
in
this
case
there
was?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
jury
would
not
know
about
the
judgment,
he
would
presumably
also
certainly
not
know
about
that
sentence
imposed?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
the
new
trial,
there
would
be
a
complete
and
uninhabited
freedom
for
the
court
to
impose
any
sentence
within
the
statutory
limits,
regardless
of
the
sentence
that
had
been
imposed
at
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
through
the
trial
of
de
novo
in
that
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
going
to
file
those
data
with
the
clerk?
