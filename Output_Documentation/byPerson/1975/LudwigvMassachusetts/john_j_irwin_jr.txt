mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
i
think
that
in
a
preliminary
way,
i
would
like
to
outline
probably
in
an
overview
fashion
the
course
i
hope
to
pursue
in
my
argument.
i
would
first
touch
on
the
jurisdictional
situation
that
i
think
is
appropriate
to
bring
before
this
court.
i
then
would
proceed
to
a
discussion
of
what,
at
least
in
the
judgment
of
the
commonwealth,
the
massachusetts
court
said
in
a
ludwig
decision.
i
would
then
try
to
impress
upon
the
court
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
notion
of
de
novo
procedure
in
massachusetts
and
what
is
all
about.
thereafter,
i
would
try
to
evaluate
that
particular
procedure
in
the
light
of
what
this
court
said
in
duncan
and
louisiana,
stating
at
least
minimally
that
our
position
if
that
duncan
and
louisiana
stated
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
rather
than
a
mode.
then
trying
to
establish
to
the
court
what
the
mode
of
delivery
of
that
right
is
in
massachusetts
and
whether
or
not
it
fulfills
the
basic
concept,
a
constitutional
concept
of
jury
trial
as
has
been
enunciated
by
this
court
and
finally,
hopefully
to
discuss
the
double
jeopardy
considerations.
proceeding
in
that
outline,
i
would
like
first
of
all
in
a
jurisdictional
way
to
ask
this
court
to
consider
that
the
record
before
it
constitutes
a
petition
for
certiorari,
rather
than
an
appeal.
the
commonwealth
does
that
fully
knowing
that
we
have
not
briefed
it,
but
in
preparing
for
the
particular
argument,
i
was
referenced
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
costarelli
where
this
subject
matter
was
raised
by
footnote
and
also
in
reviewing
the
brief
of
the
commonwealth
from
a
costarelli
case,
it
was
footnoted
there.
i
think
it
is
significant
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
we
got
this
procedure,
this
review
a
certiorari
rather
than
appeal
for
the
following
reasons.
section
2
which
is
used
by
the
appellant
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
i
think
quite
clearly
suggests
that
a
statute
has
to
have
been
put
in
issue
before
the
state
court,
allegedly
repugnant
to
the
constitution
which
statute
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
commonwealth
or
in
favor
of
the
state
at
the
highest
court
possible
for
the
defendant
--
the
appellant
to
have
a
judgment.
i
regard
that
is
being
construed
or
that
which
statute
being
construed
literally,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
is
an
issue
here
really
is
an
assertion
of
a
right
that
is
i
suppose
comprise
out
of
a
procedure
in
massachusetts
that
is
of
all
at
least
arguably
over
a
period
of
two
centuries
at
least
and
probably
three
centuries.
to
that
extent,
what
he
is
doing
is
asserting
a
right
under
section
3,
and
therefore,
if
the
court
agrees
that
certiorari
is
the
appropriate
way
in
which
this
court
has
review,
i
would
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
has
broad
jurisdiction
or
discretionary
jurisdiction
in
whether
or
not
it
would
in
fact
grant
that
particular
writ.
and
having
in
mind
the
scope
of
the
relief
that
the
appellant
seeks
here,
it
would
seem
to
me
appropriate
that
this
court
have
before
it,
a
much
broader,
detailed
record
dealing
with
the
issues
that
he
claims
to
deprives
him
of
a
constitutional
right
of
jury
trial
and
absent
that
the
court
would
deny
his
application
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
that
is
the
primary
reason
that
i
assert
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
statute
in
massachusetts
that
says
specifically
that
in
a
fairest
situation,
the
defendant
has
no
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
i
think
that
has
developed
historically.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
does
follow.
i
think
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
he
is
under
section
3
asserting
more
of
a
right
rather
that
by
a
statutory
situation,
and
that
therefore,
the
court
i
suppose
just
in
terms
of
by
the
appellate
procedure
should
construed
that
statute
very
literally.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
proceeding
line
to
analysis
of
what
the
massachusetts
court
did
in
the
ludwig
case
which
is
the
case
before
this
court,
i
think
it
safe
to
say
or
fair
to
say
that
the
court
simply
reaffirmed
its
judgment
in
the
case
of
commonwealth
versus
whitmarsh
and
i
think
that
probably
a
succinct
analysis
of
that
decision
would
be
that
massachusetts
said
that
its
de
novo
trial
procedure
as
outlined
here
before
this
court,
at
least
partially
outlined
here
before
this
court,
is
in
fact
a
constitutionally
permissible
mode
of
jury
trial
in
the
light
of
the
duncan
and
louisiana
case.
i
think
the
massachusetts
court
arguably
went
one
step
further
and
said
that
it
regarded
duncan
and
louisiana
not
as
setting
forth
an
absolute
right
to
trial
by
jury
with
all
of
the
appendages,
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way
of
the
federal
system,
but
as
establishing
a
right
rather
than
a
mode.
and
that
in
order
for
us
to
determine
here
today
whether
or
not
the
mode
that
massachusetts
applies
is
constitutionally
valid,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
examine
to
a
great
extent
the
mechanics
or
the
definition,
if
you
want,
of
the
massachusetts
de
novo
procedure.
very
briefly
there
are
four
levels
of
courts
in
massachusetts
which
deal
with
criminal
cases.
there
are
other
district
courts.
they
are
73
in
number.
they
are
geographically
located
throughout
the
commonwealth
of
the
massachusetts.
they
are
in
their
composition
i
suppose
rural,
urban,
and
suburban.
some
of
the
have
several
criminal
sessions.
it
includes
also
--
that
73
includes
the
boston
municipal
court.
its
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases
is
covered
by
chapter
218,
section
4
the
massachusetts
general
laws
which
covers
really
all
misdemeanors
and
certain
felonies
punishable
by
up
to
five
years
imprisonment.
although
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
district
court
judges
had
that
first
tier
level
if
they
take
jurisdiction
in
terms
of
a
felony
involving
possible
punishment
up
to
five
years
imprisonment,
the
district
court
judge
cannot
sentence
to
the
massachusetts
state
prison.
he
can
only
sentence
to
the
house
of
correction
and
obviously
there
are
no
juries
at
that
particular
level.
the
superior
court
is
the
court
which
i
suppose
is
most
adequately
described
as
our
great
trial
court.
it
has
a
original
jurisdiction
in
all
criminal
cases.
it
serves
as
an
appeal
court
for
the
cases
coming
out
of
the
district
court.
there
is
somewhat
of
a
interposition,
approximately
11
years
ago
of
a
six-man
jury
trial
where
on
appeal
from
the
district
court,
what
you
can
in
effect
do
is
waive
your
12-man
jury
trial
in
the
superior
court
and
opt
for
a
six-man
jury
trial,
so
probably
the
six-man
jury
is
better
described
as
being
in
for
the
purposes
of
our
discussion,
the
appeal
level
or
the
superior
court
type
of
level.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
there
is
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
have
14
counties
in
massachusetts
and
we
have
superior
court
that
covers
all
of
those
counties.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
some
of
them
--
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
we
have
46
justices
on
the
court,
in
the
superior
court.
they
sit
on
circuit,
usually
month
to
month
different
assignments
in
different
counties.
beyond
that,
in
terms
of
getting
appellate
review
of
cases
that
are
tried
in
those
two
tiers,
we
have
just
recently
three
years
ago
enacted
legislation
which
gives
us
intermediate
appellate
court
which
in
the
first
instance,
i
suppose,
reviews
all
criminal
cases
except
for
some
very
specific
exception.
those
would
be
first
degree
murder
cases,
cases
in
which
the
punishment
imposed
in
the
trial
was
life
imprisonment
or
death
and
a
situation
ironically
where
you
can
get
a
direct
appeal
from
a
six-man
jury
verdict
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
our
supreme
judicial
court
of
course
of
last
resort
and
that
is
the
court
that
decided
the
issue
in
ludwig
here
before
us.
i
think
the
next
thing
that
we
should
consider
is
that
in
the
context
of
that
particular
structure
of
judicial
dealing
with
criminal
cases,
what
happens
at
the
first
tier
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised
a
very
pertinent
point
when
he
asked,
i
think
in
connection
probably
having
in
mind
colten
and
kentucky
whether
or
not
the
defendant
in
the
massachusetts
trial
court,
the
first
tier
court
has
the
ability
to
evade
or
to
otherwise
move
away
from
that
particular
procedure
in
some
sort
of
waive
the
posture.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
procedure
and
it
was
alluding
to
somewhat
by
counsel
for
the
appellant.
there
is
a
procedure
known
as
admitting
sufficient
findings
of
fact
wherein
the
district
court
and
this
is
not
a
statutory
procedure,
but
an
accepted
procedure
that
has
evolved
over
years
in
the
court,
where
the
district
court
justice
will
hear
just
sufficiently
enough
evidence
i
suppose
to
want
him
in
concluding
that
there
is
probable
cause
for
the
existence
of
the
complaint
because
that
is
how
we
begin
in
the
first
tier
system
by
complaint.
once
having
satisfied
himself
of
that,
he
then
can
go
ahead
and
enter
a
finding
of
guilty
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
impose
a
sentence
on
that
from
which
at
least
in
the
contention
of
the
commonwealth
that
person
who
has
just
made
that
admission
has
an
immediate
right
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
once
and
forever.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
it
is
done
only
then.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
almost
in
the
category
of
waiver
i
would
say
because
what
counsel
does
ordinarily
is
go
to
the
trial
justice
in
the
court
and
indicate
that
he
really
sees
nothing
to
contest
here,
but
he
feels
that
it
would
be
better
off
in
the
superior
court
and
he
would
be
better
off
moving
there
quickly.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right
mr.
justice,
yes
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
might.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
it
could
happen
in
a
matter
of
10
minutes
if
you
your
honor
please
and
many
times
it
does.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
his
appeal
is
entered
and
i
think
when
we
are
talking
about
appeal,
my
conviction
is
or
the
commonwealth's
conviction
is
that
that
is
not
very
well
denominated.
i
would
prefer
to
call
it
an
assertion
of
his
inevitable
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
massachusetts
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
understand
that
in
massachusetts,
if
a
defendant
wants
in
any
criminal
case
from
the
most
minute
parking
violation
to
first-degree
murder,
he
can
in
fact
get
a
jury
trial
of
12.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
he
does
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
they
are
not
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
suggest
that
the
commonwealth
has
this
interest
that
there
is
before
the
court
in
the
record
here
and
in
the
briefs
an
indication
that
the
massachusetts
district
court
system
as
we
know
it,
handles
approximately
one
million
criminal
matters
a
year.
that
de
novo
approach
allows
the
district
court
in
our
judgment
to
weed
out
those
cases
that
appropriately
should
not
go
on
in
to
the
superior
court
where
a
proper
exercise
or
judicial
judgment
will
terminate
the
case
by
way
of
a
not
guilty
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly,
that
would
be
acceptable
to
the
defendant.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
in
this
situation
that
you
posited
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
the
state
really
has
no
benefit
if
what
you
are
suggesting
is
the
situation
that
i
think
you
are
that
where
they
know
he
is
going
to
appeal.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
in
the
situation
that
you
just
posited
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
court,
the
district
court
in
question,
given
the
situation
that
you
just
posted,
in
my
judgment
would
do
nothing
more
than
satisfy
itself
that
there
is
probable
cause
for
the
existence
of
that
complaint
and
to
a
finding
of
guilty
and
say,
leave
and
go
have
your
appeal
because
it
is
the
expeditious
way
to
handle
the
matter
in
my
judgment.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
that
is
in
effect
what
they
are
doing.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
judge
has
no
option.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
he
may
accept
the
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well
no,
i
think
what
he
would
do
mr.
justice
white
if
a
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
in
the
district
court
where
he
had
final
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
he
can,
but
the
only
thing
that
is
open
to
him
on
a
an
appeal
from
a
plea
of
guilty
is
the
disposition
of
the
case,
the
sentencing.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
he
may
not.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
he
apparently
waived
that
jury
trial
and
again
i
suppose
that
is
one
of
the
options
that
is
open
to
him.
what
he
could
do
even
if
he
gets
to
the
superior
court
where
he
might
be
claiming
a
12-man
jury,
he
is
empowered
under
our
massachusetts
set
up
to
go
ahead
and
waive
his
jury
trial
there.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
apparently
it
was
not.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
i
think
your
are
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
if
your
honor
please
how
rhode
island
goes
about
it
except
that
apparently
my
understanding
is
that
what
they
do
now
is
offer
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance
at
the
district
court
level,
allow
the
defendant
to
assert
his
right
to
jury
trial
and
set
it
out
for
a
jury
trial.
i
think
what
you
have
in
mind
is
probably
the
consequences
of
the
holiday
case.
yes.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
say
massachusetts
i
suppose
could
advance
a
court
rule
by
rule
of
court
or
probably
without
legislative
change
do
exactly
that
if
your
honor
please.
what
i
would
suggest
the
court
though
is
that
constitutionally
i
do
not
think
that
is
necessary.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
it
does
not.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
it
does
not.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
say
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
do
not
think
you
could
do
that
now.
i
do
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
no,
you
could
not.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
it
is
if
your
honor
please.
i
believe
it
is
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
think
they
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
constitutional
law.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
is
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
your
honor
it
is
moving
along
in
the
argument,
the
commonwealth's
position
is
that
when
this
court
enunciated
duncan
and
louisiana,
what
it
did
really
was
a
establish
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
but
did
not
establish
a
mode
to
constitutional
jury
trial,
and
therefore,
it
is
open
to
massachusetts
and
other
de
novo
states
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
de
novo
procedures
that
they
have
in
effect
deliver
constitutionally
mandated
jury
trial
in
a
constitutional
mode.
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
on
the
intense
analysis
that
this
court
is
made
by
its
procedure
and
in
weighing
it
against
the
perspectives
that
was
set
out
in
analyzing
the
jury
trial
right
in
duncan
and
louisiana,
we
can
find
that
the
massachusetts
system
is
basic
and
fundamental,
first
by
way
of
historical
analysis,
second
by
way
of
contemporary
practice
as
among
other
states
and
thirdly,
to
the
extent
that
it
fulfills
the
stated
function
and
purpose
of
the
jury
trial
in
america
to
wit
i
suppose
to
stand
as
a
bastion
against
depression
and
to
allow
a
person
accused
of
crime
to
have
the
judgment
of
his
peers
in
any
given
criminal
case
that
is
presented
against
him.
it
seems
to
me
that
by
that
analysis
and
by
a
fair
and
objective
appraisal
of
the
massachusetts
system,
we
can
find
that
the
massachusetts
system
does
serve
to
prevent
(1)
unfounded
criminal
charges
brought
to
eliminate
enemies,
(2)
judges
who
are
too
responsive
to
the
voice
of
higher
authority,
(3)
protection
against
arbitrary
action,
(4)
the
massachusetts
system
does
prevent
the
corrupt
an
overzealous
prosecutor,
(5)
it
does
prevent
the
situation
where
you
have
a
compliant
or
a
biased
or
eccentric
judge,
(6)
it
does
preserve
to
present
the
exercise
of
plainary
powers
over
the
life
and
liberty
of
the
citizens
by
one
judge
or
a
group
of
judges
and
(7)
it
does
prevent
un-checked
power
and
it
does
prevent
arbitrary
law
enforcement.
it
seems
to
me
that
going
back
and
analyzing
duncan
against
louisiana,
this
court
try
to
determine
what
constitutional
jury
trial
was
in
terms
of
its
history
and
in
terms
of
its
contemporary
use
i
suppose
in
our
society.
but
it
seem
to
me
that
thereafter
that
when
this
court
decided
cases
such
as
apodaca
and
such
as
williams
in
florida
or
apodaca
in
oregon,
that
what
it
did
really
was
lean
more
toward
an
evaluation
of
whether
or
not
this
particular
jury
system
that
is
put
in
question
serves
those
basic
purposes
that
i
just
told
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
in
the
affirmative
then
the
system
that
is
challenged
in
the
given
state
stands
the
test
of
constitutionally
fair
jury
trial.
finally,
the
commonwealth
would
direct
itself
for
a
few
moments
to
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
well,
again
i
think
that
my
position
in
callan
against
wilson,
of
the
callan
and
wilson
case
is
this
if
your
honor
please.
duncan
and
louisiana
in
interpreting
callan
and
wilson
as
i
suppose
was
imposed
upon
the
states,
in
effect
said,
that
where
you
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
federal
system
for
a
particular
offense
that
is
beyond
petty,
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
given
state.
my
understanding
of
the
duncan
and
louisiana
case
was
that
there
was
a
statute
which
provided
for
no
jury
trial
and
yet
allowed
a
punishment
up
to
two
years
in
prison.
the
callan
case
apparently
involved
imprisonment
potential
over
six
months.
six
months
or
over
and
the
court
i
think
simply
said
in
duncan
and
louisiana
in
interpreting
callan
and
wilson,
that
where
a
state
seeks
to
impose
punishment
of
over
six
months
in
as
much
as
you
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
federal
court
if
that
were
the
case,
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
state.
so,
i
guess
what
i
am
saying
is,
i
know
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
this
state
now
that
is
in
a
position
where
it
can
sentence
somebody
to
more
than
six
months
imprisonment,
this
court
would
say
in
terms
of
duncan
and
louisiana
and
callan
and
wilson
that
that
state
has
to
provide
a
jury
trial.
i
do
not
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
duncan
and
louisiana,
this
court
have
enunciated
what
mode
of
jury
trial
that
had
to
take.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
court
has
gone
on
later
on
in
apodaca
and
then
williams
to
indicate
that
certain
guarantees
in
terms
of
federal
jury
trial
certainly
are
not
binding
on
the
states.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly.
in
which
he
said
we
can
have
to
hide,
but
we
do
not
have
to
rub
the
tail.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
two
years
in
the
house
of
correction
and
a
fine
up
to
$200.00.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
jury
will
not
know
about
it.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
if
there
is
a
waiver
at
the
district
court?
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
the
judge
would
know.
yes,
he
would.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
exactly,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
it
is
not
uncommon
and
yet
it
is
not
uncommon
that
they
impose
the
same
sentence
or
maybe
even
lighter
sentences.
i
would
say
that
it
varies
almost
on
a
50/50
basis.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
yes,
it
is
if
your
honor
please.
for
just
the
final
few
moments
left
to
me
in
this
argument,
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
double
jeopardy.
it
seems
to
me
that
colten
and
kentucky
is
dispositive
at
that
contention
here
by
the
appellant.
i
suggest
that
for
several
reasons
and
one
is
that
my
recollection
of
the
colten
and
kentucky
case
directing
itself
to
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
contrasted
pearson
north
carolina
case
--
quite
distinguished
the
pearson
north
carolina
case
and
pointed
to
the
question
of
vindictiveness
and
i
think
to
a
certain
extent
that
has
just
been
touched
upon
here.
it
does
not
appear
that,
for
example,
in
terms
of,
i
suppose
exiting
your
right
to
appeal
on
trial
de
novo
that
you
are
in
any
jeopardy
of
vindictiveness
because
what
you
are
doing
is
you
are
going
from
a
different
court
system
to
a
superior
court
where
the
people
who
will
adjudicate
your
claim
are
in
no
way
connected
with
the
first
court.
secondly,
i
think
the
court’s
position
that
if
in
fact
in
colten
and
kentucky,
you
have
a
true
de
novo
type
of
system
where
there
is
in
effect
a
wiping
clean
of
the
slate
than
obviously
all
of
those
things
that
are
inherent
in
double
jeopardy
such
as
the
hazards
of
trial,
the
necessity
of
utilizing
your
tools,
i
suppose
at
that
given
hearing,
all
of
those
types
of
things
are
non-existent
in
that
so
called
de
novo
procedure,
and
therefore,
are
not
vulnerable
to
a
claim
of
double
jeopardy
as
i
see
it
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
would
be
totally
consistent
with
the
finding
in
colten
and
kentucky
to
find
that
massachusetts
de
novo
system
exactly
does
wipe
the
slate
clean,
and
therefore,
presents
no
double
jeopardy
problem
to
this
particular
court.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
irwin,
jr.
there
are
not.
there
are
situations
where
we
have
the
six-man
jury
trials
in
district
courts,
but
they
are
on
appeal
from
that
district
court
as
i
try
to
outline
and
i
think
they
are
probably
more
properly
considered
by
this
court
to
be
at
superior
court
level.
if
your
honor
please,
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
