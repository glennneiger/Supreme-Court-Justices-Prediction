justice

trial?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
colten
against
kentucky
is
against
you
on
that
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
has
a
two-tier
court
system.
a
person
accused
of
certain
crimes
is
tried
in
the
first
instance
in
the
lower
tier
where
there
is
no
trial
by
jury,
and
if
convicted
he
may
appeal
to
the
second
tier
and
if
his
conviction
followed
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
he
is
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo
by
jury
in
the
second
tier.
mr.
ludwig
pleaded
not
guilty
to
a
charge
of
negligent
operation
of
an
automobile
and
after
his
motion
for
a
jury
trial
was
denied,
he
was
convicted
by
a
judge
in
the
first-tier
court.
he
then
appealed
for
the
second
tier.
there
he
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
a
speedy
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance
and
on
the
further
ground
that
he
was
being
subjected
to
double
jeopardy.
his
motions
both
were
denied
and
he
then
waived
the
jury
trial
and
was
again
convicted
in
the
second
tier.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
affirmed,
holding
that
the
denial
of
his
request
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
in
the
lower
tier
did
not
violate
ludwig’s
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
or
to
a
trial
by
jury
and
that
the
massachusetts
procedure
did
not
place
him
twice
in
jeopardy.
we
hold
that
the
massachusetts
two
tier
system
does
not
deprive
an
accused
of
his
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial,
but
instead
absolutely
guarantees
trial
by
jury
to
persons
accused
of
serious
crimes
and
that
the
manner
specified
for
exercising
this
right
is
fair
and
not
unduly
burdensome.
the
system
provides
a
jury
trial
that
protects
an
accused
from
any
prosecutorial
or
judicial
misconduct.
the
fact
that
an
accused
may
undertake
to
incur
the
cost
of
an
additional
trial
does
not
unconstitutionally
burden
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
we
further
hold
that
the
procedure
does
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth.
according
may
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
powell,
although
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justices
brennan
and
stewart
and
marshall.
