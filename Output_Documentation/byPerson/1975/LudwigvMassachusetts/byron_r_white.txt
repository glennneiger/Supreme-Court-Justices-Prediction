the
constitutional
provision
you
are
relying
on?
justice

relying
on

of
them?
justice

white
can
he
appeal

white
so
that

you
could
not
just
sort
of
refer
the
case
to
the
second
tier?
justice
byron

white
or
just
permit
an
appeal

(inaudible)
privilege

satisfy
your
argument

and
then
appealing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
asking,
i
know
you

like
it,
but
how
about
if
congress
has
constitutional
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
colten
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggested
in
colten
that
he
can
get
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
tier
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
he
could
just
plead
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
you
are
suggesting
that
will
be
elected
in
colten
under
the
kentucky
system
that
he
can
have
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
tier?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
to
say
you
can
plead
guilty
and
do
not
have
a
jury
trial
in
an
upper
court
and
to
say
that
you
can
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
alright,
now
which
is
it
in
the
colten
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
frank
to
say,
i
did
not
recall
that
about
the
kentucky
system
i
knew
that
you
could
plead
guilty
and
automatically
get
a
jury
trial
when
you
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
elect?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
was
true
in
colten?
