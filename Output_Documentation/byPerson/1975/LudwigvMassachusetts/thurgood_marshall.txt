you
say
that
a
man’s
driver’s
license
can
be
taken
for
a
conviction
that
has
been
completely
nullified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
never
went
to
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
–
the
court
of
appeals
would
say,
well,
since
you
are
going
to
appeal
and
you
are
going
to
a
jury
trial,
you
do
not
have
to
go
through
this
over.
what
good
is
the
first
tier
into
the
state
where
you
know
the
man
is
going
to
appeal
and
ask
for
a
jury
trial.
what
benefit
does
the
state
have
in
the
first
tier?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
suggesting
the
situation
you
said.
you
said
that
that
where
the
man
goes
in
and
it
tells
the
judge,
look
i
am
going
for
an
appeal
and
i
am
going
because
i
want
a
jury
trial.
now,
why
does
not
he
just
not
go
and
get
the
jury
trial.
why
does
the
state
say,
whoop
before
you
do
that
you
got
to
go
through
this
charade?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
the
way
because
you
just
transferred
to
the
other
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
certainly
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
if
you
put
a
rule
that
if
a
man
does
not
show
in
the
second
tier,
he
goes
free?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
you
would
have
a
little
difficulty
to
get
that,
would
you?
