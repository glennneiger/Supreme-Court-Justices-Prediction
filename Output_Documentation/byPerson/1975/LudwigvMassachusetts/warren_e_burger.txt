mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
imposed
at
the
first
trial
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
to
your
friend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
went
to
the
second
tier,
you
did
not
want
a
jury,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
you
were
afraid
you
might
win
in
the
second
tier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sounded
like
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
irwin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
legislature
has
to
do
it
by
this
particular
mechanism
except
for
the
judge
has
no
option,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
hypothetical
we
have
done
putting
to
you
about
his
standing
aside
in
order
to
get
a
jury
trial
do
not
fit
this
case,
do
they,
because
he
did
not
want
a
jury
trial
in
the
second
tier?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
normally
the
purpose
in
most
cases
of
bypassing
or
standing
mute
at
the
first
tier
trial
is
in
order
to
get
a
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
is
not
the
objective
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
without
an
amendment
to
your
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
hagopian.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
it
is
common
defaults
or
many
defaults,
is
it
not?
you
are
saying
if
he
defaults,
he
is
in
trouble.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
contrary,
convictions
can
be
held
in
absentia
if
the
defendant
voluntary
absents
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
i
think
it
was
default,
his
failure
to
show
at
the
second
tier
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-377,
ludwig
against
massachusetts
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.

justice
