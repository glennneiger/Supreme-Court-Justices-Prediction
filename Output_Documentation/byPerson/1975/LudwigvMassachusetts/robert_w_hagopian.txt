mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
underlying
issue
on
the
merits
of
this
case
is
whether
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceedings
has
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
when
he
is
charged
upon
an
offense
on
which
he
faces
maximum
prison
sentence
in
excess
of
six
months.
in
the
instant
case,
the
defendant
richard
ludwig
was
denied
a
right
for
trial
by
jury
in
the
first
instance
and
he
was
convicted
on
the
first
tier
in
the
massachusetts
court
system
and
he
took
an
appeal,
whatever
the
word
might
mean,
to
the
second
tier
in
the
massachusetts
system.
at
that
time
he
presented
a
motion
to
dismiss,
based
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy
and
also
on
the
grounds
that
his
first
trial
was
an
error
that
there
were
errors
in
the
first
trial.
i
do
not
know
what
type
of
motion
to
dismiss
that
is,
but
leaving
that
aside
that
is
what
massachusetts
calls
it,
some
sort
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
in
the
second
tier
proceedings
he
waived
his
rights
for
trial
by
jury
and
that
was
on
my
advice
as
counsel
to
present
a
mootness
issue
from
arising.
that
decision
took
place
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
costarelli
versus
massachusetts
and
i
exercise
my
best
judgment
as
to
what
i
thought
the
state
of
law
was
at
that
time.
ludwig
was
convicted
by
a
judge,
eventually
took
an
appeal
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
which
took
the
position
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
first
instance,
that
this
court
has
not
made
that
clear
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
or
in
subsequent
decisions.
they
allege
that
they
state
of
the
law
was
in
a
flux.
they
did
not
apply
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
absence
of
any
prior
decisions
by
this
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
appeal
and
although
the
commonwealth
has
not
raised
it,
i
think
that
there
is
somewhat
of
a
problem
in
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
at
least
in
view
of
costarelli.
in
a
certain
sense,
when
mr.
ludwig
took
an
appeal
from
the
first
tier
to
the
second
tier,
he
vacated
the
judgment.
now,
let
me
see
if
i
can
draw
an
analogy
here.
we
will
make
it
a
little
bit
clearer
what
i
am
talking
about.
in
a
single
tier
system
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
he
does
not.
it
is
vacated
automatically
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
judgment
is
vacated,
but
that
subject
has
several
limitations.
one
is
this;
he
also
may
lose
his
license
which
is
in
ludwig’s
case.
now,
i
would
suppose
that
that
is
not
part
of
the
judgment
in
the
sense
that
the
judge
does
not
write
down
on
the
complaint,
but
the
statute
says
whoever
is
convicted
down
in
the
district
court,
the
clerk
of
the
court
sends
a
notice
to
the
registry
and
the
registry
yanks
his
license.
to
me
that
is
part
of
the
judgment.
it
is
a
criminal
punishment
that
is
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
but
his
revocation
exists
of
his
license
and
that
is
an
effect
and
that
is
penalty
that
is
being
imposed
because
he
is
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense.
that
is
not
a
civil
sanction.
it
is
a
criminal
sanction.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
is
quite
correct
and
because
it
arises
out
of
a
criminal
offense,
it
is
not
a
civil
sanction.
it
is
a
penalty
that
is
imposed
if
you
read
boyd
versus
united
states
and
those
forfeiture
cases
where
they
also
take
--
to
forfeit
the
goods
of
an
automobile
because
it
has
been
used
in
a
heroin
case.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
it
is
clear
massachusetts
law.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
there
is.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
it
is
not
in
my
brief
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
it
is
boyle
and
whitmarsh
versus
the
registrar
of
motor
vehicles
and
i
do
not
have
the
citation,
but
i
will
say
that
i
raised
the
same
issue
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
case
called
almeida
versus
massachusetts
in
this
court
affirmed
that
decision
and
i
must
confess
in
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
wait
a
minute,
i
take
that
back,
there
were
two
whitmarsh
decisions.
the
first
whitmarsh
decision
which
was
cited
in
the
costarelli
brief
is
the
one
on
the
trial
de
novo
issue
itself.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
there
was
another
whitmarsh
decision,
your
honor.
that
was
against
the
registrar
of
motor
vehicles.
that
whitmarsh
decision
which
was
cited
in
by
this
court
in
costarelli
involved
an
aspect
of
just
a
criminal
aspect.
we
have
a
separate
case
going
on
against
the
registrar.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
do
not
your
honor,
but
we
will
furnish
that
subsequently.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
absolutely
and
unequivocally
and
what
is
worst
is,
the
statute
says
that
once
he
is
acquitted
in
the
second
tier
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
absolutely
and
unequivocally,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
and
no
doubt
about
that.
that
is
black
letter
law
in
massachusetts
if
there
is
such
a
thing
and
the
statute
also
provides
that
after
he
is
convicted,
if
he
is
acquitted
in
the
second
tier,
the
registrar
gives
him
back
his
license
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
now,
it
is
a
matter
administrative
procedure,
it
is
automatic.
the
minute
he
is
acquitted
in
the
second
tier
he
gets
his
license
back.
so,
you
see
what
happened
is
they
have
imposed
a
punishment
on
him
for
the
price
of
a
trial
by
jury
and
that
only
not
only
applies
to
license
revocation,
it
also
applies
to
parole
probation
revocation.
that
issue
is
now
before
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
what
usually
happens
in
these
cases
when
a
fellow
is
on
probation,
he
gets
and
if
he
is
convicted
of
a
subsequent
offense
in
the
district
court
and
he
alleges
that
a
trial
de
novo,
they
yank
his
probation.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
am
not
too
sure
about
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
once
they
are
caught
in
the
united
states
and
the
case
i
cited
in
my
brief
that
holds
that
they
do.
the
reason
is
that
it
depends
upon
why
they
yanked
his
license.
if
it
is
because
he
commits
a
criminal
offense
as
defined
by
statute
in
the
state
court
then
i
am
not
sure
the
burden
must
be
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
now,
whether
the
jury
trial
issue
gets
in
there
is
another
matter.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
would
say
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
at
least
if
the
hearing
was
to
determine
his
competency
on
the
road.
there
are
state
court
decisions
which
hold
that
where
the
revocation
is
purely
as
a
penalty
for
committing
a
criminal
offense,
whether
that
is
road
related
or
not,
that
he
is
entitled
to
all
criminal
rights
that
a
criminal
defendant
has.
now,
there
is
one
case
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
up
in
the
state
of
alaska
and
they
have
held
squarely
that
he
is
entitled
to
trial
by
jury.
if
you
are
going
to
yank
a
man’s
license
for
a
year
because
that
period
of
time
is
such
a
lengthy
period
of
time
and
that
is
such
a
penalty
that
he
is
entitled
to
it.
and
right
in
this
district
here,
the
district
of
columbia
versus
colts
because
there
was
a
fine
imposed
and
i
think
there
was
maximum
prison
sentence
of
two
months,
but
they
talk
about
in
district
of
columbia
versus
colts
that
that
is
a
penalty
in
the
context
that
it
is
being
revoked.
now,
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
but
there
are
a
number
of
similar
cases,
i
think
three
or
four
years
ago,
there
was
a
case
called
one
lot
emerald
cut
stones
which
involved
this
issue.
i
think
that
was
a
forfeiture
case.
now,
i
suppose
in
these
forfeiture
proceedings,
they
can
be
civil
in
nature
and
only
the
civil
burdens
are
required
of
the
government.
but
where
that
impose
in
boyd,
in
klamath
(ph)
car
case
and
i
have
cited
those
in
my
brief
there
are
cases
in
this
court
that
hold
that
you
must
afford
the
accused
criminal
protection
or
criminal
rights
in
this
type
of
situations.
one
of
these
cases
is
one
lot
emerald
cut
stones
versus
united
states
as
a
footnote
in
that,
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
wrote
that
opinion
and
the
other
one
is
one
1958
plymouth
sedan
versus
pennsylvania
and
boyd
versus
united
states.
i
have
also
cited
in
page
50
and
51,
the
alaska
--
the
decision
of
alaska
supreme
court
on
this
particular
issue.
but
getting
back
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
again,
let
us
take
a
single
tier
system.
if
a
man
is
convicted
in
a
single
tier
system,
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
he
has
the
option,
he
may
or
the
state
may
afford
him
to
grant
him
a
new
trial.
he
may
make
a
motion
for
new
trial.
the
minute
he
makes
that
motion
for
new
trial
and
it
is
granted,
he
does
not
have
any
right
to
complaint
about
what
has
happen
before
in
the
first
trial
and
the
de
novo
procedure
is
in
same
sense.
the
fellow
has
an
option
to
elect
a
trial
de
novo.
let
us
assume,
and
there
are
many
jurisdictions,
i
think
there
are
16
jurisdictions
in
united
states
where
you
can
get
a
jury
trial
in
either
the
first
tier
or
the
second
tier.
now,
at
the
end
of
the
first
tier,
a
fellow
has
that
option
to
get
another
trial
de
novo
by
jury
or
by
judge.
he
does
not
have
to
exercise
that
option
and
to
me,
if
the
state
does
not
grant
him
a
right
of
appellate
review
with
that
stage
of
the
proceedings,
he
has
the
right
to
come
to
this
court,
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
either
by
appeal
or
certiorari
or
he
may
go
over
to
the
federal
district
court
by
habeas
corpus
or
if
a
fine
is
imposed
he
may
go
over
perhaps
under
the
civil
rights
act.
i
have
a
case
where
a
fellow
did
not
want
to
go
to
the
second
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
in
that
case,
costarelli
exercise
his
right
for
trial
in
his
second
tier.
but
i
have
cases
where
a
fellow
in
cambridge
district
court
was
convicted
and
fined
$65.00
for
larceny.
instead
of
going
for
a
trial
de
novo,
we
walked
over
to
the
federal
district
court
under
the
civil
rights
act,
even
though
a
fine
was
only
imposed
and
are
seeking
a
collateral
attack
on
that
first
tier
of
conviction.
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
federal
review
of
that
conviction
without
going
through
the
second
trial.
that
is
--
in
a
sense
that
is
the
whole
basis
of
the
merits
of
this
case,
that
an
accused
does
not
have
to
go
through
two
trials.
he
has
a
right.
he
should
have
the
right
to
have
a
trial
that
comports
with
the
constitution
in
the
first
instance
and
he
should
have
a
right
for
appellate
review
in
a
federal
court
if
the
state
does
not
grant
him
appellate
review
at
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
he
cannot.
the
most
he
can
do
is
just
sit
and
with
his
counsel,
the
government
will
plan
their
witnesses,
he
cannot,
there
is
an
informal
procedure,
it
is
not
statutory,
what
is
known
as
submitting
to
an
informal
admissions
of
facts
and
which
means
that
you
are
not
really
going
to
contest
the
trial.
you
allow,
he
will
say
to
go
on
the
government
still
puts
his
pray
to
witnesses
on,
that
is
a
means
of
speeding
up
the
first
tier
trial,
but
he
is
still
convicted,
found
guilty,
but
there
is
no
way
of
bypassing
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
but
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
danger
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
that
testimony
that
is
what
happened
to
whitmarsh.
the
police
chief
officer
against
whitmarsh
died
subsequent
to
the
first
trial
and
then
when
the
second
trial
came
up,
they
wanted
to
try
whitmarsh
again
and
introduce
his
testimony
that
police
chief
officer’s
testimony
from
the
first
trial
and
if
you
do
not
attack
his
credibility
or
cross-examining
him
in
the
first
trial,
that
evidence
can
be
use
against
you
in
the
second
trial
so
that
a
certain
amount
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
know
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
$20.00
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no
prison
in
sentencing
involved
in
the
case.
that
fundamentally
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
issue
of
the
right
to
trial
i
think
that
the
issue
was
a
very
simple
issue.
there
is
no
reason
at
all
that
justify
why
massachusetts
has
a
right
to
take
this
man
right
to
trial
by
jury
away
from
him
then
there
is
his
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses.
his
right
not
to
self-incriminate
himself.
he
has
right
not
to
counsel.
i
mean,
why
can
massachusetts
not
take
those
rights
away
from
say,
hey
we
will
give
him
a
second
trial
de
novo,
we
will
cure
all
these
defects.
i
mean,
that
argument
was
in
wood
versus
the
village
of
monroeville
or
the
mayor
of
monroeville
and
i
cannot
distinguish
why
the
right
for
trial
by
jury
should
be
any
different
than
any
other
fundamental
right.
it
is
true
we
have
a
six-month
demarcation
line,
but
that
came
out
of
historical
origins,
but
there
is
no
historical
origins
to
justify
the
trial
de
novo
system
in
england.
at
the
time
that
this
country
was
founded
that
there
was
trials
de
novo
bench
trials
and
you
will
find
that
colonies
in
massachusetts,
but
they
are
extremely
few
colonies
or
states
that
ever
had
a
trial
de
novo
system
of
jury
trial
system
as
opposed
to
bench
trial
systems
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
framed.
that
basically
is
the
fundamental
issue
in
the
case,
your
honor
and
i
submit
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
think
that
is
true,
but
i
would
not
rest
entirely
on
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
let
us
assume
that
that
callahan
versus
callan
versus
wilson
was
never
came
about
to
be.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh!
no,
certainly
not
your
honor.
i
think
that
i
agree
that
that
case
was
decided
by
unanimous
supreme
court,
in
this
court
here.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor,
basically,
but
the
underlying
basis
of
that
case
is
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
deprived
of
due
process
and
that
is
what
is
basically
the
argument,
the
bedrock
of
callan
is
that
in
fact
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
words
said,
the
defendant
should
not
have
to
suffer
the
burdens
of
two
trials
and
that
is
the
bedrock
of
callan.
i
would
also
like
to
say,
i
am
not
saying
we
should
do
away
with
trial
de
novo.
all
i
want
is
the
accused
to
have
that
right
to
have
the
option
for
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance
and
that
is
not
going
to
affect
massachusetts.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
compelling
interest
doctrine
should
apply
to
this
case,
but
even
if
you
do
apply
it
to
this
case,
massachusetts
can
easily
give
the
defendant
the
option.
there
are
very
few
defendants
that
are
going
to
exercise
that
option.
there
are
certain
instances
where
that
option
will
always
be
exercised,
but
in
those
types
of
cases,
the
fellow
is
almost
inevitably
going
to
take
the
right
for
trial
de
novo
anyway.
there
are
cases
that
if
you
do
give
them
the
option,
there
will
be
a
slight
increase
perhaps
and
very
incontestable
of
the
number
of
jury
trials,
but
it
is
only
going
to
be
in
those
cases
where
the
fellow
has
been
deterred
originally
by
the
do
novo
system.
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
commonwealth
has
any
right
to
complain
about
that
end
result.
so
in
effect,
what
i
am
simply
asking
here
is
in
the
sense
that
the
accused
have
the
option
to
go
to
the
jury
first
and
i
do
not
understand
why
massachusetts
should
complain
about
that
issue.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
they
do
not
advise
him
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
they
say,
you
have
a
right
of
appeal
and
all
these
convictions
where
the
fellow
does
not
exercise
his
appeal,
if
you
look
at
the
record,
on
the
face
of
the
record,
no
where
has
he
waived
his
right
for
trial
by
jury.
he
has
failed
to
appeal,
whatever
that
term
may
mean,
but
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
record
to
show
that
he
has
waived
his
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
i
have
cases
in
the
federal
district
court
where
prisoners
have
been
released
from
the
massachusetts
first
tier
system,
simply
because
there
is
nothing.
even
if
you
sustain
or
agree
with
the
de
novo
concept,
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
record
to
show
that
he
has
waived
his
right
for
trial
by
jury.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
principle
underneath
callan
is
very
simple.
it
is
a
deprivation
due
process.
it
is
a
burden.
the
defendant,
why
should
he
have
to
go
through
two
trials?
not
only
why
should
he
get
what
he
is
entitled
in
the
first
instance.
likewise,
why
should
he
have
to
go
through
two
trials
before
he
has
a
right
to
federal
review?
the
jurisdiction
issue
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
justice
harlan
in
that
case
that
he
would
not
follow
it.
he
did
not
say
why
he
would
not
follow
it.
he
disapproved
of
it,
but
the
decision
is
not
all
that
clear,
what
his
reasoning
is,
but
you
get
into
this
problem
of
what
is
required
in
the
federal
system
as
opposed
to
what
is
required
in
the
state
and
i
think
harlan
did
not
obviously
address
himself
to
that
issue.
no,
that
is
right
he
did
not
have
to
and
because
that
is
the
problem,
but
underneath
the
bedrock
of
that
case
is
very
simple
and
harlan
expressed
it.
he
said
a
man
should
not
have
to
go
through
twice
what
he
is
entitled
to
in
the
first
time
and
that
is
the
bedrock
of
that
decision.
it
seems
to
me
that
sound
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
due
process.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor
and
of
course
that
is
interpreting
that
as
to
what
that
meant
and
i
suppose
the
sixth
amendment
and
he
in
a
sense
that
callan
also
interprets
what
was
in
the
sixth
amendment
too.
the
words
in
the
massachusetts
constitution
are
almost
identical
or
equivalent,
that
is
what
chief
justice
shaw
said
in
the
massachusetts
case.
he
says,
it
is
the
same
thing
as
interpreting
the
sixth
amendment,
but
chief
justice
shaw
also
does
not
show
any
historical
basis
sustaining
his
decision
and
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
historical
basis
to
sustain
the
de
novo
procedure.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
rely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor
and
also
fundamentally
due
process.
i
think
it
is
fundamental
issue,
due
process.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor,
both
of
them.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
there
is
the
double
jeopardy
issue
and
the
double
jeopardy
issue,
your
honor
is
a
very
simple
issue.
it
says
you
cannot
force
the
man
to
go
through
two
trials
to
jump
the
hoop
twice.
that
is
exactly
what
double
jeopardy
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
limits
the
government
to
a
single
proceeding,
that
means
a
single
proceeding
that
comports
with
constitutional
standards.
i
do
not
see
how
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
can
be
read
in
the
other
way.
i
mean,
that
is
the
whole
underlying
basis
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor
because
in
colten
versus
kentucky,
the
man
had
aright
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance
in
colten.
he
waived
that
right
in
colten.
i
also
have
a
summary
of
the
de
novo
procedures
in
30
jurisdictions
that
was
prepared
not
by
myself,
but
the
court
--
i
would
like
this
just
briefly
there
are
30
jurisdictions.
16
of
them
allow
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
tier
or
the
second
tier.
one
jurisdiction
allows
a
jury
trial
in
either
one
tier
or
the
other.
you
take
your
pick
and
the
13
remaining
jurisdictions,
of
those
you
cannot
get
a
jury
trial
in
seven
of
them
in
the
first
instance
and
six
of
them
you
have
a
right
to
bypass
the
first
tier
trial
and
go
directly
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
second
tier
trial.
if
the
court
would
like
i
would
be
glad
to
submit
all
the
statutes
in
the
30
jurisdictions.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
they
are
not
your
honor.
there
is
something
by
the
national
state
courts,
but
it
is
no
where
as
comprehensive
as
this.
i
submitted
for
jury
information
purposes
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
has
a
copy,
i
have
supplied
him.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
did
not
want
it.
i
did
not
want
to
moot
out
the
issue
and
i
thought
that
if
we
asked
for
jury
trial
that
if
he
was
convicted,
there
would
be
nothing
to
complain
about
and
if
he
was
found
innocent
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
battle.
that
was
just
a
decision
and
based
on
the
law
at
the
time,
the
government
never
raises.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no.[laughter]
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
you
mean,
before
a
jury?
well,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
that
gets
us
back
to
that
things
are
not
in
the
face
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor
$20.00.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
may
i
clear
up
one
or
two
points
your
honor.
the
first
point
is
about
this
appeal
in
certiorari
jurisdiction.
the
statute
in
massachusetts
chapter
218,
section
26
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts.
the
district
courts
have
been
construed
by
massachusetts
in
jones
versus
robins
to
mean
courts
without
jury
and
that
statute
is
squarely
presented
among
other
statutes
so
i
think
the
case
is
properly
up
here
on
appeal.
number
two,
your
honor
there
are
a
lot
of
consequences
about
this
business
in
the
first
tier
trials
that
my
brother
has
not
mentioned
and
the
most
important
one
is
that
once
the
sentence
is
imposed
in
the
first
tier,
if
the
defendant
defaults
in
the
second
tier,
supposing
he
does
not
show
up
when
he
is
suppose
to,
that
sentence
of
the
district
court
is
imposed
and
the
man
winds
up
going
to
jail
and
it
is
not
pursuant
to
a
judgment
of
his
peers
by
the
district
court
sentence,
that
statutory
in
massachusetts
and
it
goes
on
all
the
time.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
sure
he
is
but
you
cannot
convict
the
man
in
absentia
and
that
is
what
it
is.
it
is
a
judgment
by
default.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
believe
that
issue
your
honor
was
raised
and
tacon
versus
arizona
right.
i
do
not
think
i
can
--
if
he
absents
himself
from
trial,
but
if
the
state
never
gets
him
into
court
to
begin
with,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
can
be
tried
in
absentia.
i
do
not
think
that
issue
has
been
squarely
presented
by
this
court,
but
what
happens
here
is
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
what
happens
is
the
first
tier
judgment
is
then
imposed.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
suppose
they
can
arrest
them,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh!
i
did
not
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
do
your
honor,
but
you
see
what
happens
is
that
it
shifted
the
burden
here
to
defendant.
and
in
the
second
tier,
everybody
knows,
the
juries
all
know
that
these
fellows
have
been
convicted
down
in
the
first
tier.
the
trials
are
segregated.
these
district
court
judges
sit
on,
not
so
superior
court
judges
and
it
is
quite
obvious
that
they
have
been
convicted.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
in
criminal
proceedings
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
there
can
be
any
constitute
waiver
for
the
specific
fundamental
procedural
right
in
a
criminal
trial
unless
it
is
expressed.
in
fact
most
courts,
most
jurisdictions,
so
it
must
be
written.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
true
in
the
criminal
proceedings.
in
fact,
in
boyd
they
hold
it
unless
there
is
something
on
the
record,
forget
about
whether
he
even
did
waive
it,
if
it
is
non-established
on
the
record,
the
conviction
has
to
be
set
aside
as
i
understand
that
case.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
do
not
like
to
see
the
fact
that
he
has
to
plead
guilty
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
conviction
itself
burdens.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
that
is
a
close
issue
because
that
is
the
case
in
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
have
to
concede
to
that
point
your
honor
because
you
wrote
the
opinion
in
colten
that
is
what
you
said
so.
i
guess
that
is
established
law.[laughter]
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
he
has
not
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
he
can.
he
can
plead
guilty
and
take
an
appeal
and
automatically
wipes
out
the
proceeding.
we
cannot
do
that
in
massachusetts,
you
plead
guilty.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
that
also
was
established
in
the
case
called
ramirez
(ph)
versus
robinson.
the
main
procedure
you
could
plead
guilty
and
do
the
same
thing
and
the
first
circuit
sustained
that
procedure.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
is
right.
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
because
you
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
colten,
in
the
first
tier
then
i
think
that
if
you
plead
guilty,
it
certainly
different
and
if
you
did
not
have
that
opportunity
before
the
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
but
you
have
that
right
for
the
jury
trial
in
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh!
yes
in
the
16-jurisdiction
it
is
like
that.
lastly,
just
let
me
say
what
happened
in
rhode
island.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
know
it
is
true
in
colten
your
honor.
i
read
that
very
carefully
and
in
fact,
i
believe
that
you
even
mentioned
that
back
to
yourself
in
a
footnote
in
costarelli,
excuse
me
or
the
per
curiam
court
did
and
i
think
that
is
quite
clear.
let
me
just
say
in
rhode
island
what
happens
is
that
if
a
fellow
wants,
unless
he
signs
a
waiver,
a
written
waiver
for
jury
trial
in
the
first
tier
the
papers
are
transmitted
right
up
to
the
superior
court
and
he
is
given
his
jury
trial
in
the
second
tier
immediately.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
i
have
that
later
on.
i
will
supply
the
citations
your
honor.
