mr.

at
this
point
do
i
understand
new
york
state
courts
have
gone
the
opposite
way
in
this
very
issue?
unknown
speaker
anddo
i
correct
--
do
i
understand
that
the
--
the
federal
court,
the
second
circuit
has
upheld
a
regulation
against
attack
so
far
as
firemen
are
concerned?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sweeney,
what
--
what
do
you
concede
is
the
burden
of
the
court
of
appeals
imposed
on
your
client
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
establishing
a
genuine
public
need
for
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
standard
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
state
right
was
compelling?
unknown
speaker
what
you
say
about
(inaudible)
a
legitimate
status?
when
he
says
the
rule
as
an
arbitrary
limitation
and
the
purposeness
was
strike,
is
that
what
you
--
that
spell
out
compelling?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
did
you,
in
the
trial
of
that
case?
unknown
speaker
now,
a
little
while
ago
you
spoke
of
a
legitimate
state
interest,
do
you
draw
distinction
between
that
and
a
compelling
state
interest?
unknown
speaker
they
do
not
sound
the
same
to
me,
but
you
have
sort
to
find
them
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
if
i
must
say
mr.
sweeney,
in
this
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
take
away
personal
liberty
as
not
to
compose
simply
and
only
of
freedom
under
the
fundamental,
implying
that
this
is
not
a
fundamental
right?
unknown
speaker
that
includes
the
freedom
to
make
an
act
unless
significant
personal
decisions
without
arbitrary
government
interference
and
then
going
on
to
say
limitation
with
such
a
right
requires
some
showing,
some
showing,
not
compelling
or
not
any
other
standard?
unknown
speaker
that
is
some
showing
of
public
need
--
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
judge
mishler
must
have
held,
am
i
right,
was
that
there
was
no
showing
of
any
kind?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
suggestion
is
that
there
is
public
need,
in
what?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
some
regulations
could
be
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
such
as
shaving
the
head?
