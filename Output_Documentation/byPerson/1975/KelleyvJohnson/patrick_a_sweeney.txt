mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
july
of
1971,
the
police
commissioner
of
suffolk
county
amended
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
suffolk
county
police
department,
concerning
certain
grooming
regulations
for
the
members
of
the
police
force.
in
substance,
the
rule
stated
that
members
of
the
force
should
be
neat
and
clean
at
all
times
and
that
male
personnel
should
comply
with
grooming
standards
in
respect
to
hair.
hair
on
the
head
should
be
neat,
cleaned
and
trimmed.
it
should
not
touch
the
ears
or
the
collar
and
the
hair
in
front
of
the
head
should
be
groomed
so
that
it
does
not
fall
below
the
band
of
properly
worn
headgear.
in
no
case
would
the
bulk
or
length
of
the
hair
interfere
with
the
proper
wear
of
any
authorized
headgear.
the
grooming
regulation
also
mentioned
sideburns
that
they
should
be
neatly
trimmed.
with
respect
to
mustache,
a
short
and
neatly
trimmed
mustache
may
be
worn.
as
to
beards
and
goatees,
the
face
should
be
clean-shaven.
wigs
are
also
mentioned
in
the
regulation
that
an
individual
may
wear
a
wig
for
cosmetic
reasons
to
cover
natural
baldness,
if
he
so
desires.
this
regulation
was
to
take
effect
august
1,
1971.
on
august
4,
1971,
an
action
was
commenced
in
--
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
in
new
york
basically
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
a
permanent
injunction
enjoining
the
suffolk
county
police
department
from
enforcing
such
a
regulation.
the
plaintiff’s
complaint
in
that
case
stated
that
the
mere
existence
of
the
regulation
violated
his
first
amendment
right
of
free
expression
and
the
second
aspect
is
that
the
regulation
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
because
no
state
shall
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
nor
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
the
regulation
is
in
the
appendix
on
page
57
and
58.
i
will
mention
that
there
was
an
amendment
to
even
that
regulation
and
that
is
on
page
48.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes.
the
main
one
that
i
have
just
referred
to
is
on
page
57
and
58.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
the
amendment
basically
was
a
compromise
that
for
instance
with
respect
to
mustache
is,
if
they
happen
to
go
below
the
lower
lip
that
that
did
not
matter.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
there
are
approximately
2,600
members
of
the
suffolk
county
police
department
of
which
approximately
2,100
are
uniformed
police
officers.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
it
does.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
it
does.
for
non-uniform
personnel
and
personnel
who
would
be
assigned
to
a
particular
undercover
duties
an
exception
would
be
made.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
just
in
suffolk
county.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes.
well,
in
suffolk
county
they
would
have
jurisdiction
over
most
of
the
towns
within
the
county
so
that
that
is
the
predominant
police
force
in
suffolk
county.
there
are
some
local
village
police
departments.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes
and
the
issue
is
before
this
court
of
whether
or
not
the
length
of
hair,
whether
it
is
on
the
head
or
facial
or
a
combination
of
both
is
a
first
amendment
right
and
if
it
is
--
or
does
it
fall
within
a
--
at
least
penumbra
of
the
first
amendment
and
if
it
is
not
under
the
first
amendment,
does
it
fall
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
third,
if
it
does
fall
within
either
one
of
these
amendments,
is
it
a
substantial
right
equivalent
to,
for
instance,
free
speech
or
is
it
an
ingredient
of
personal
liberty
which
though
not
substantial,
is
nevertheless
a
right.
and
lastly,
as
applied
to
police
officers
in
suffolk
county,
does
the
--
the
state’s
interest
in
effect
of
law
enforcement
by
uniformed
police
--
appearance
of
police
officers
outweigh
the
individual’s
right
to
govern
his
personal
choice
of
appearance?
now,
when
the
case
first
came
before
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
it
was
basically
on
papers
and
affidavits
submitted
to
the
court.
chief
judge
mishler
in
that
case,
dismissed
the
complaint,
stating
basically
that
the
suffolk
county
police
department,
because
it
was
quasi-military
in
character
that
--
and
that
uniformity
of
dressing,
grooming
are
essential
to
effect
the
law
enforcement,
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
on
appeal,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed,
stating
in
substance
that
there
should
have
been
--
a
hearing
or
some
testimony
concerning
the
state’s
interest
in
this
case.
they
did
while
stating
that
they
held
no
view
on
the
merits,
they
did
state
that
hair
in
and
off
itself
presents
a
substantial
constitutional
question.
they
stated
that
the
length
of
hair
was
an
ingredient
of
an
individual’s
personal
liberty
and
that
personal
liberty
is
not
composed
simply
of
the
freedom
held
to
be
fundamental,
but
includes
the
freedom
to
act
on
less
significant
personal
decisions.
after
a
hearing
before
chief
justice
mishler,
he
more
or
less
reversed
what
he
had
stated
before,
feeling
himself
bound
by
what
the
second
circuit
had
reiterated
in
terms
of
quasi-military,
and
stated
that
uniformity
of
police
officers
and
safety
of
police
officers
are
not
legitimate
state
interest.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion
and
of
course
we
are
here
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari.
first
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
if
it
is
substantive
right?
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
that
is
correct.
in
greenwald
against
frank,
the
state
--
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed
the
appellate
division,
second
department.
they
squarely
ruled
on
an
issue
which
was
before
the
nassau
county
--
which
was
a
similar
regulation
in
nassau
county
which
is
the
sister
country
of
suffolk
county.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
that
is
correct
also
and
--
and
that
is
both
in
this
case
and
with
respect
to
fireman,
those
were
the
cases
decided
after
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
ruled
that
with
respect
to
police
officers,
the
issue
was
one
of
a
modest
regulation
because
the
suffolk
county
police
department
was
quasi-military
in
character
that
there
was
not
a
substantial
federal
question
present.
what
constitutes
a
neat
appearance
in
the
opinion
of
the
police
commissioner
of
suffolk
county
should
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
commissioner.
the
length
of
hair
in
and
off
itself
does
not
rise
to
basic
constitutional
questions.
substantive
constitutional
rights
and
liberty
should
only
be
recognized
by
this
court
wherefundamental
liberties
are
at
stake.
certainly,
this
court
has
seen
fit
to
go
beyond
the
literal
language
of
the
bill
of
rights
by
defining
such
rights
as
right
of
privacy,
but
we
do
not
have
that
issue
present
here.
the
burden
should
not
be
on
the
stake
here
that
suffolk
county
police
department
to
show
that
this
regulation
is
constitutional.
they
should
be
in
a
regulation
of
this
type,
a
presumption
of
constitutionality.
i
have
this
in
his
brief
--
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
it
should
apply
here
and
--
and
my
adversary
is
mentioned
that
in
that
respect
that
you
can
seek
review
in
a
state
court
where
a
regulation
is
arbitrary
and
i
do
not
disagree
with
that
viewpoint.
i
think
that
is
what
was
done
in
greenwald
against
frank
and
i
think
that
is
what
should
have
been
done
in
this
case
and
that
was
the
proper
way
to
decide
because
that
can
always
be
tested
for
reasonableness
in
a
state
court.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
i
think
that
the
state
courts
probably,
since
they
are
here,
suits
by
patrolmen
benevolent
association’s
constantly
at
various
regulations
or
rules
of
police
departments
that
they
are
more
familiar
with
at
least
having
a
hearing
as
to
arbitrariness
and
--
and
that
--
what
the
rule
of
this
nature,
that
is
the
proper.
they
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
arbitrariness
at
that
point
and
i
think
that
is
the
better
approach
and
this
--
this
regulation
is
no
different
from
any
other
regulation
that
may
be
part
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
suffolk
county
police
department.
it
is
always
subject
to
reasonableness.
two
cases
are
in
conflict
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
brought
to
this
court
and
that
is
between
the
second
circuit
decision
here
and
the
eighth
circuit.
if
you
look
at
the
underlying
reasoning
in
both
circuits,
they
both
do
not
define
the
length
of
hair
as
a
substantial
constitutional
right.
they
merely
both
say
it
is
less
significant.
certainly,
it
is
not
enumerated
in
the
constitution,
but
they
lend
--
both
speak
in
terms
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
that
respect,
they
both
place
the
burden
of
proof
upon,
in
this
case,
the
suffolk
county
police
department,
to
show
a
legitimate
state
interest
reasonably
related
to
the
regulation.
in
respect
to
a
police
officer,
he
certainly
is
the
most
visible
representative
of
government
that
we
have
in
this
country
today.
it
is
the
position
of
the
police
commissioner
that
the
grooming
of
the
hair
is
no
different
from
cleaning
and
pressing
his
uniform,
cleaning
his
fingernails,
bathing
frequently.
it
is
just
part
of
those
rules
and
regulations.
if
you
are
going
to
isolate
every
one
of
these
regulations
then
we
can
be
in
court
on
every
single
one
of
them.
there
has
to
be
not
a
separation
of
this
as
a
basic
fundamental
right.
there
are
parents,
say,
as
much
about
the
police
officer
--
about
themselves
as
the
agency
they
represent
and
for
the
public
trust
they
hold.
grooming
standards
as
part
of
uniform
regulations
is
a
legitimate
state
interest,
is
a
non
question
interest
of
a
local
police
department
in
effect
of
law
enforcement
and
if
you
look
at
the
two
decisions
again,
you
will
see
that
they
are
really
differing
on
what
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
one
court
is
saying
and
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying,
yes
we
believe
that
is
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
the
second
court
by
affirming
what
chief
judge
mishler
had
stated.
he
is
saying
it
is
not
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
i
am
saying
that,
firstly,
if
assuming
arguendo
there
is
a
right,
i
am
saying
that,
it
is
not
substantial
that
it
may
be
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
state’s
interest
in
effective
law
enforcement
outweighs
that
individual
police
officer
in
having
as
hair
at
any
length
he
chooses.
we
are
all
subject
to
the
some
infringement
on
our
personal
liberties.
if
i
was
to
come
before
your
honors
now
wearing
a
bathing
suit,
i
probably
would
not
have
gotten
passed
the
guards.
now,
i
guess
that
there
is
some
infringement
on
my
personal
liberty
at
that
point,
but
certainly
the
fact
that
this
is
a
third
branch
of
government
and
the
dignity
of
the
court
outweighs
my
individual
preference
at
that
time.
well,
the
regulation
of
this
court,
i
believe
is
a
guideline
which
says
conservative
business
dress,
i
am
not
sure
if
at
some
point
what
that
means.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
it
does.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
well
--
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
i
can
say
this.
it
would
probably
bar
many
of
the
presidents
of
the
united
states
and
it
would
probably
bar
jesus
christ
if
he
was
alive
today
or
moses,
but
by
the
same
token,
any
of
those
individuals,
if
they
lived
today
to
be
suffolk
county
police
officer,
i
could
not
be
one;
i
am
over
29
years
old
so
i
could
not
be
one
for
that
reason.
i
--
i
will
have
to
take
a
civil
service
test.
there
are
many
reasons
why
one
would
become
a
police
officer.
there
are
many
restrictions
on
it.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
i
do.
i
look
at
the
--
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
they
certainly
do
and
i
--
i
believe
the
regulation
of
hair
is
part
of
that
and
--
and
if
i
--
i
attach
that
to
the
appendix
or
in
a
separate
volume,
excerpts
from
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
suffolk
county
police
department
--
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
no,
and
but
when
they
go
home
even
on
their
personal
time,
they
can
associate
with
persons
known
to
have
been
convicted
of
misdemeanor
or
felony
and
that
certainly
is
a
restriction
on
their
personal
rights
and
election
law
426
of
the
state
in
new
york
says
that
a
police
officer
cannot
be
a
member
of
a
political
committee,
a
political
club,
or
contribute
money.
now,
certainly
that
is
all
on
his
own
personal
time.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
alright.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
well,
i
am
just
indicating
that
this
is
one
of
many
infringements
if
you
want
to
say
it
on
what
may
be
termed
rights.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
i
would
think
it
is.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes,
i
think
it
is
a
greater
infringement,
yes.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
after
reading
the
decision
many
times,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
burden
placed
was
a
--
the
rational
relationship
test
--
not
the
compelling
interest,
but
i
think
there
was
some
confusion
in
that
decision
because
they
talked
about
a
substantial
constitutional
issue
and
then
they
talked
about
rationality
and
i
think,
even
chief
judge
mishler
had
a
problem
with
that
because
you
will
see
at
the
conclusion
of
his
case,
he
says
that
we
did
not
establish
a
legitimate
state
interest
which
shows
he
was
--
he
was
not
sure
of
the
burden
of
proof
at
that
point
himself.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
right
and
so
that
presented
problems.
i
would
say
that
if
anything,
it
should
have
been
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
that
that
was
shown
by
the
record.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
yes.
i
would
reserve
any
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
just
briefly.
i
think
this
court
realizes
that
we
are
not
here
talking
about
the
hair
of
individuals.
we
are
talking
about
the
length
of
hair
of
police
officers.
it
is
the
police
commissioner’s
contention
that
personal
right,
if
it
would
be
a
right
of
a
police
officer,
under
that
decision
of
greenwald
against
frank
is
offset
by
the
powerful
countervailing
interest
of
the
police
department
and
the
general
public.
certainly,
the
state
court’s
share
equal
responsibility
with
the
federal
courts
on
the
enforcement
of
federal
rights
under
the
principles
of
comity
that
is
the
decision
which
should
have
been
followed
and
if
it
is
a
right
within
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
burden
of
proof
would
certainly
sustain
and
the
--
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
i
believe
--
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
that
is
what
he
held.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
the
uniformity
of
appearance
and
for
safety
of
the
police
officer
which
in
turn
is
safety
of
the
general
public.
thank
you.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
that
is
correct
and
as
they
say
in
new
york
city
police
for
the
would
be
perpetrators,
the
criminals,
so
they
can
identify
police
also,
prevention
of
crime.
mr.
patrick
a.
sweeney
no,
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
get
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
then
you
are
always
going
to
have
a
problem.
for
instance,
if
the
hair
is
a
little
bit
over
the
ears,
is
that
a
problem
too?
i
think
you
have
to
leave
that
to
the
discretion
to
the
discretion
of
the
police
commissioner.
let
him
set
reasonable
standards.
if
they
are
unreasonable
and
i
think
he
could
promulgate
even
if
this
court
held
that
he
had
such
a
right,
there
is
a
possibility
at
some
place
in
this
country
a
police
commissioner
could
make
an
unreasonable
regulation,
but
i
think
a
court
would
strike
that
down,
for
that
reason
as
being
unreasonable.
