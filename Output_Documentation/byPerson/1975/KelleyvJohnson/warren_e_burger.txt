we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
kelley
against
johnson.
mr.
sweeney
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible),
except
in
the
remote
sense
getting
more
and
more
remote
that
you
are
an
officer
at
the
bar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
surrender
some
of
it
when
they
are
required
to
wear
uniforms?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that
is
something
like
hair
check
that
is
all
was
it
not
and
up
to
now
the
hair
check
has
survived,
has
survived
constitutional
scrutiny?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
this
is
of
a
piece
with
--
with
that
limitation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
a
greater
infringement
if
you
call
that
a
greater
limitation
when
the
police
regulations
forbid
his
making
a
political
speech?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
direct
conflict
of
the
first
amendment,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
wexler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
no
one
has
argued
that
policemen
and
soldiers
are
exactly
alike?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
exactly
alike?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quasi.(voice

alike
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
not
anything
alike?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
union
finally
imposed
on
the
department
a
requirement
that
they
all
have
crew
haircuts,
what
would
be
your
remedy
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
the
union
negotiated
a
contract
requiring
crew
haircuts
essentially
like
that
provided
for
the
united
states
marines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
1840
or
1530,
the
early
dates
you
were
talking
about,
they
did
not
have
electric
razors
or
safety
razors
that
was
a
common
custom
for
great
many
people
to
wear
beards
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
some
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
not
talking
about
people
generally;
we
are
talking
about
policemen
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
sweeney?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
