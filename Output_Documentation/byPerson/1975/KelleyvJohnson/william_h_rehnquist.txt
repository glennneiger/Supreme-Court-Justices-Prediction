mr.
sweeney,
does
the
suffolk
county
police
department
have
jurisdiction
over
incorporated
cities
within
suffolk
county
or
just
outside
of
incorporated
city?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
--
the
incorporate
cities
are
not
regard
as
being
part
of
suffolk
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
their
jurisdiction
concurrent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
with
respect
to
every
kind
of
regulation
or
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
you
are
just
saying
that
general
rule
should
--
should
apply
here
as
well
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
the
state
court
would
demand
more
of
the
state
in
effect
under
the
--
its
reasonableness
or
arbitrary
test
than
the
federal
courts
could
under
the
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
in
these
people
that
would
protect
them
if
the
state
could
not
show
a
legitimate
state
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
suffolk
county
passed
an
ordinance
requiring
all
of
its
citizens
when
they
appeared
on
the
public
streets
to
be
dressed
in
(inaudible);
do
you
think
that
would
raise
a
constitutional
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
--
you
in
effect
do
feel
that
there
is
some
right,
constitutional
right
somewhere
perhaps
surrendered
by
policeman
to
regulate
your
own
dress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
policemen
are
to
be
required
to
wear
uniform
while
on
duty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
all
citizens
of
suffolk
county
could
be
required
to
wear
uniforms
while
in
public?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
surely
there
are
differences
where
the
state
may
demand
more
of
a
member
of
the
police
force
and
of
an
individual
citizen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
we
get
a
compelling
state
interest
standard
when
we
are
talking
about
what
regulations
the
state
can
impose
on
an
employee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
a
compelling
state
interest?
why
not
simply
a
test
of
reasonableness
or
rationality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
this
--
is
this
the
standard
that
the
courts
reveal
statutes
or
legislative
ordinances
by
they
hold
a
trial
and
make
findings
of
fact,
i
thought
that
was
for
the
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
of
the
reaction
was
--
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
policemen
followed
the
general
sartorial
turn
of
the
society?
in
1960,
you
would
have
not
needed
a
regulation
like
this
because
no
policemen
would
have
wanted
his
hair
the
way
your
clients
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
a
regulation
limiting
the
length
of
a
policeman's
hair.
respondent
policemen
is
the
president
of
the
patrolmen's
benevolent
association
in
suffolk
county,
long
island,
new
york.
in
1971,
his
predecessor
brought
an
action
in
the
district
court
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
against
petitioner's
predecessor,
the
commissioner
of
the
suffolk
county
police
department,
claiming
principally
that
the
commissioner's
order
establishing
hair-length
standards
violated
his
liberty
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
complaint
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
new
york
reversed
saying
that
the
choice
of
personal
appearances
is
an
ingredient
of
an
individual's
personal
liberty
protected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
the
police
department
had
the
burden
of
establishing
a
genuine
public
need
for
the
regulation.
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
respondent
policeman
and
that
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
again.
because
we
hold
that
the
hair-length
regulation
challenged
here
did
not
violate
any
right
guaranteed
respondent
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
reverse;
respondent
has
sought
constitutional
protection
from
the
hair-length
regulation
not
as
an
ordinary
citizen
but
as
an
employee
of
the
police
force
of
suffolk
county.
this
status
affords
the
state
wider
latitude
in
imposing
restrictive
regulations
as
part
of
a
mode
of
organization
which
it
has
chosen
as
the
most
efficient
in
enabling
the
police
force
to
carry
out
the
duties
assigned
to
it
under
state
and
local
law.
this
choice
of
organizational
structures
entitled
to
the
same
sort
of
the
same
sort
presumption
of
legislative
validity
as
their
choices
designed
to
promote
other
aims
within
the
state's
police
power
and
the
burden
is
therefore
on
respondent,
the
policeman
in
this
case
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
the
regulation
based
as
it
is
on
the
state's
method
of
organizing
its
police
force
and
the
promotion
of
safety
of
persons
and
property.
the
district
court's
initial
dismissal
was
therefore
correct.
we
believe
that
matters
not
whether
the
choice
of
a
uniform
police
force
reflects
a
desire
on
the
part
of
suffolk
county
to
make
police
officers
readily
recognizable
to
the
public
on
the
one
hand,
or
foster
its
predictor
on
the
other
hand.
either
justification
is
sufficiently
rational
to
defeat
respondent's
claim
based
on
the
liberty
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
