mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
the
first
police
department
was
established
in
new
york
city
in
1844
not
by
right
of
the
united
states
constitution
or
the
new
york
state
constitution,
but
local
laws.
after
that
many
police
departments
were
formed
and
the
first
laws,
declaring
police
departments
or
policeman
quasi-military
were
in
the
1880s,
masterson
versus
french
in
new
york,
1888;
mcauliffe
versus
city
of
new
bedford,
1880s;
massachusetts;
hart
versus
board
of
fire
commissions,
1880,
new
york.
thereafter
these
cases
became
the
leading
cases
cited
in
both
state
and
federal
courts
throughout
the
country
that
policeman
are
quasi-military.
i
feel
those
cases
were
wrong.
it
was
not
until
this
court
said
in
garrity
that
policemen,
like
teachers
and
lawyers
are
not
relegated
to
worded
down
versions
of
constitutional
rights
and
it
was
finally
the
dwen
case.
this
case
that
said
policemen
are
not
quasi-military.
they
are
ordinary
civil
service
workers.
now,
what
has
happened
to
police
department
since
1844?
the
most
significant
thing
was
the
civil
service
law
which
was
passed
after
all
the
leading
cases
of
the
1880s.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
no.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes
sir,
as
an
employee
if
there
is
an
compelling
state
interest
of
course.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
because
there
are
certain
needs
the
state
has
which
supersedes
the
needs
of
an
individual,
and
therefore,
the
burden
is
placed
upon
the
state
to
prove
that
need,
the
right
to
wear
a
uniform.
of
course
if
there
is
a
need
they
have
a
right
to
do
it.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
well,
we
are
taking
away
someone’s
rights.
if
we
are
dealing
with
rights,
constitutional
rights,
there
should
be
a
compelling
state
interest
not
the
test
of
reasonableness.
these
are
not
whims
or
rules.
these
are
rights
or
people
we
are
talking
about
and
there
should
be
a
compelling
state
interest
if
we
are
going
to
make
the
individual
give
up
his
rights.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
i
think
they
may
be
compelling
state
interest,
yes.
i
think
you
give
that
right
up.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
maybe,
not
appearance.
maybe
you
do
not.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
it
is
more
than
that.
whether
i
shine
my
shoes
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes,
it
is
appearance
sir,
but
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes.
but
i
think
there
are
different
rights
involved
with
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes
[laughter]
and
i
do
not
mean
by
that
alone.
well,
as
--
as
i
said
what
happened
to
police
department,
so
i
am
talking
about
quasi-military,
the
basis
of
the
barry
case,
the
dwen
case,
i
said
civil
service
came
in
after,
these
leading
cases
in
the
1880s,
civil
service
took
away
the
right
of
the
police
commissioner
to
appoint,
promote,
suspend,
and
retire?
he
no
longer
had
that
authority
and
civil
service
in
new
york
state
said
the
military,
the
state
military
is
excluded
from
that.
i
am
trying
to
show
the
distinction
why
those
cases
do
not
apply
the
all
leading
cases.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
that
--
the
argument
has
been
up
until
dwen
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
no,
quasi.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
i
want
to
establish
they
are
not.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
no.
i
pointed
out
civil
--
i
pointed
out
civil
service
has
changed
the
appointment,
the
promotion,
the
retirement,
the
discharge,
excluding
the
military.
then
we
have
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
i
think
the
police
can
maintain
order
in
the
town.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
that
is
--
it
has
gone
beyond
the
police
authority.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
if
i
can
be
permitted
to
continue
on
in
that
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
no.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes,
you
do
in
the
postal
strike,
you
send
the
policeman
in.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
sir,
i
thought
that
was
the
job
that
the
postal
to
move
the
mail.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
i
beg
to
defer
sir.
when
they
would
talk
about
the
riots
in
the
jail,
they
were
going
to
send
the
state
militia
to
take
over
the
supervision
in
running
of
the
jails.
that
was
the
talk
was,
and
that
is
what
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
they
did
not.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
compelling.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes
sir.
well,
continuing
then
the
courts
passed
cpa,
article
78,
giving
the
procedure
in
which
the
test,
the
findings
of
the
head
of
the
department,
including
the
police
commissioner.
it
has
been
traditionally
that
the
courts
would
not
interfere
or
limitly
interfere
in
the
proceedings
in
the
military.
here
we
set
up
a
legal
proceeding
to
test
the
actions
of
a
police
commissioner.
i
think
the
greatest
significance
to
show
that
the
police
is
not
even
quasi-military
is
the
taylor
law.
the
taylor
law
provided
that
the
police
will
be
their
bargaining
unit
and
be
a
union
and
negotiate
all
terms
and
conditions,
not
with
the
police
commissioner,
but
with
the
county
representatives
where
the
police
commissioner
is
not
one
of
the
parties
to
the
action.
now,
what
are
the
terms
and
conditions
that
are
being
contracted
between
the
county
and
that
is
any
municipality
and
the
police,
the
hours,
the
wages,
and
the
uniform.
if
the
county
and
the
pba
in
their
negotiations
decided
that
be
no
uniform,
the
police
commissioner
must
enforce
it.
if
they
decided
the
uniform
would
be
white
regardless
of
what
the
police
commissioner
says,
it
has
to
be
white.
in
addition
to
the
uniform,
the
hours,
the
terminal
leave,
the
equipment,
guns
carried
by
policemen
are
now
negotiable,
negotiated.
in
addition,
thereto
they
have
tour
of
duty.
they
have
personal
leave.
when
their
tour
of
duty
ends,
when
it
starts,
what
shift
they
are
in,
these
are
all
negotiable
items.
can
we
envision
patrolman
or
the
lowest
rank
in
the
service
negotiating
with
congress
to
establish
a
book
of
rules
that
the
commander
in
chief
must
follow?
that
is
what
we
have
now
in
police
departments.
the
patrolman,
the
pba
negotiates
with
the
--
with
the
county
to
create
a
contract
which
is
then
turned
over
to
the
police
commissioner
who
must
administer
that
contract.
now,
i
agree
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
they
have
not
been
able
to.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
that
maybe
a
possibility.
everything
else
is
negotiated,
i
agree.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
if
the
union
imposes
it
sir?
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
then
i
do
not
think
the
contract
can
--
contract
the
way
constitutional
rights
of
its
members.
i
think
the
membership
would
have
a
right
to
attack
it.
again,
my
argument
is
trying
to
show
they
are
no
longer
quasi-military
in
view
of
the
fact
of
the
rights
that
have
been
taken
away
from
a
police
commissioner
as
he
originally
had
and
as
i
said
the
contract
book
that
is
negotiated
first
was
very
small.
it
gets
bigger
and
bigger
each
year
which
means
the
police
commissioner
has
lost
his
power.
he
is
just
the
administrator
of
the
book
with
certain
other
powers
of
course,
but
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
because
he
is
the
one
who
passed
this
regulation.
he
is
the
one
who
put
it
forth.
i
have
to
talk
about
the
other
case,
the
chameleon
case.
my
brother
makes
our
position
saying
that
how
can
you
have
two
different
decisions
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
have
to
tell
this
court
that
i
have
a
trial
of
when
and
the
appeal
and
the
trial
of
chameleon
and
the
appeal.
chameleon
was
based
on
dwen
and
that
court,
the
city
of
new
york
were
able
to
show
that
fireman
responding
to
a
fire
must
wear
facial
mask
because
most
of
them
go
into
fires
where
there
are
numerous
gases
and
they
have
to
wear
it.
they
were
able
to
prove
through
a
legitimate
state
interest
that
the
seal
of
the
mask
is
affected
by
facial
hairs
and
they
proved
this
for
many
laboratory
reports,
and
therefore,
there
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
to
regulate
hair
because
of
the
safety
to
the
men
and
of
course
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
not
on
that
theory
sir.
i
opposed
it
concerning
the
proof
they
offered,
i
conceded
dwen
and
i
rely
on
dwen.
i
did
fight
the
proof
whether
it
is
so
or
not.
if
it
so,
they
are
right
under
dwen
and
--
and
the
finders
of
the
fact
found
that
they
were
right.
there
was
leakage
in
the
gas
mask.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
no,
when
the
issue
was
involved,
we
had
the
trials
in
both
cases;
hearings,
witnesses
were
called,
fact
situations.
in
the
dwen
case,
the
finder
of
the
fact,
judge
mishler
found
the
police
department
has
failed
to
prove
their
--
thepoint.
in
the
chameleon
case,
they
found
that
the
fire
commissioner
did.
he
found
some
compelling
state
interest
that
they
should
regulate
hair
because
of
the
seal
on
the
gas
mask.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
no,
the
same.
legitimate
or
compelling
would
be
the
same.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes
sir.
can
i
--
can
i
briefly
say
that
with
all
this
legalistic
talk
about
hair,
does
it
not
really
break
down
to
a
person’s
grooming
habits
and
prejudice?
we
--
i
am
sure
when
the
police
department
was
established
in
1844;
the
policeman
had
the
kind
of
hair
that
handlebar
mustache,
the
mutton
chops,
and
so
forth.
when
the
decisions
calling
them
quasi-military
were
passed,
i
am
sure
all
policemen
had
the
bushy
hair,
the
mustaches,
and
so
forth
as
we
traditionally
see.
it
was
not
until
the
60s
where
the
hippies
came
in,
where
hair
became
a
dirty
thing
and
we
started
to
regulate
hair.
the
regulation
that
we
are
attacking
only
came
into
1971.
so
prior
to
that
there
is
no
safety
problem
with
hair,
there
is
no
uniformity
problem,
we
are
reacting
to
a
situation,
a
hair
situation
--
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
and
to
this
day,
it
still
common
custom
for
many
people
to
wear
beards.
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
yes,
is
that
not
a
personal
right?
mr.
leonard
d.
wexler
but
why
are
policemen?
well,
i
am
not
supposed
to
ask
questions,
i
am
sorry.
well,
i
think
i
will
conclude
with
just
saying
what
thomas
jefferson
said,
no
man
should
be
judged
by
the
cut
of
his
hair.
thank
you.
