mr.
robert
d.
city
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
single
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
massachusetts
was
declaring
unconstitutional,
that
portion
of
a
massachusetts
statute
which
separated
members
of
the
uniformed
branch
of
the
massachusetts
state
police
from
the
general
retirement
classification
in
which
they
had
been
placed,
enforced
mandatory
retirement
upon
this
officers
at
the
age
of
50
on
the
grounds
that
these
men
were
superannuated.
the
undisputed
facts
show
that
each
officer
has
been
determined
fit
to
continue
in
his
duties.
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
rests
upon
its
analysis
of
the
statute
in
terms
of
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
d.
city
it
is
not
a
class
action
your
honor.
the
point
that
i
am
making
here
is
that
the
elaborate
medical
screening
which
the
uniformed
branch
uniformly
applies
across
the
board
from
the
time
at
which
a
man
first
joins
to
the
time
he
reaches
his
50th
year
is
applied
to
every
single
member.
mr.
robert
d.
city
and
it
is
our
contention
that
having
screened
this
group
through
this
fine
mesh,
the
only
group
that
reaches
50,
the
only
group
that
can
continue
to
serve
at
age
50
because
everyone
who
does
not
meet
this
standards
is
set
aside,
he
just
cannot
continue
to
serve.
so
the
only
way
that
you
get
to
reach
your
50th
year
is
to
continue
to
be
fit.
therefore
the
group
upon
which
this
statute
applies
its
across
the
board
classification
is
a
group
which
by
definition
the
commonwealth
has
already
defined
as
fully
fit
and
fully
qualified
to
perform.
mr.
robert
d.
city
your
honor
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
the
burden
upon
the
individual
member
increases
at
age
40,
he
has
to
be
found
to
be
fit
every
single
year.
the
problem
that
we
have
is
that
these
members
continued
to
be
fit.
those
members
in
their
40th,
their
41st,
their
42nd
year
who
are
unfit
are
separated
and
only
those
men
who
are
fit
continue.
the
question
is
why
then
draw
the
line
at
the
50th
year?
mr.
robert
d.
city
well
i
think
that
the
district
court
opinion
addresses
itself
to
that
problem
and
i
think
the
later
that
we
get
in
age,
the
inevitable
aging
does
set
in
and
the
problems
that
are
incumbent
upon
us
become
greater.
but
your
honor
let
me
suggest
this
that
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
would
not
be
here
provided
that
at
age
55
the
medical
testing
which
is
already
the
order
of
the
day
showed
one
of
two
things.
one,
it
showed
that
some
of
the
group,
at
least
some
of
the
group,
were
not
being
fit,
we
would
just
not
be
able
to
meet
standards.
that
is
not
--
in
any
given
year
the
number
who
would
come
back
were
significantly
less.
secondly,
the
district
court
suggest
that
perhaps
the
issue
of
predictive
validity
is
another
reason
to
retire
a
man,
that
perhaps
at
age
50
or
51,
even
though
a
man
passes
a
physical
examination,
it
is
no
assurance
that
he
is
going
to
continue
to
be
fit
for
the
next
year
until
he
is
examined
again.
the
evidence
show
that
as
in
the
case
of
airline
pilots,
the
predictive
validity
of
physical
examinations
is
extensive
and
elaborate,
and
this
one
really
only
begins
to
break
down
at
around
the
age
of
60.
so
the
point
is,
that
i
would
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
that
is
for
airline
pilots.
i
would
say
your
honor
that
that
would
be
the
most
critical
situation
where
you
have
to
worry
about
a
man
suffering
a
disability
under
a
stress
situation.
i
think
that
while
state
police
may
be
in
analogous
situations
i
think
that
they
are
not
as
regularly.
so
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
standard
used
in
airline
pilots
are
certainly
the
most
rigorous
one
and
i
think
the
commonwealth
is
a
hard
placed
to
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
would
submit
that
the
examination
used
in
this
case
which
covers
60
pages
of
the
appendix
here
is
extremely
extensive
physical
examination.
mr.
robert
d.
city
your
honor
we
had
a
medical
expert
who
testified
in
this
case
who
was
familiar
with
the
medical
--
he
was
a
doctor
for
the
airlines
and
was
familiar
with
the
medical
tests
and
he
felt
that
they
were
comparable.
i
think
one
point
ought
to
be
cleared
up.
state
police
officers
are
members
of
the
department
of
public
safety
and
are
classified
under
the
general
massachusetts
retirement
statute
as
group
3
employees.
if
you
look
in
the
general
massachusetts
retirement
statute
you
will
be
find
that
group
3
employees
are
required
to
retire
at
age
55.
the
statute
which
is
the
subject
of
the
case
before
this
court
selects
particular
members,
the
massachusetts
state
police,
that
is
members
of
the
uniformed
branch,
selects
them
out
of
group
3
and
puts
him
into
a
separate
sub-classifications
which
requires
retirement
at
age
50.
and
the
statute
by
its
terms
says
it
does
this
on
the
grounds
that
these
men
are
superannuated.
that
is
that
the
state’s
necessary
interest
in
keeping
a
fit
force.
mr.
robert
d.
city
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
a
functional
relationship.
mr.
robert
d.
city
there
is
no
doubt
your
honor
that
they
are
different
retirement
ages
for
different
activities.
and
again
i
want
to
make
clear,
we
are
not
challenging
here
the
variable
retirement
ages
which
the
general
statute
applies
in
massachusetts.
we
are
talking
about
70
for
the
general
employees;
65
for
the
ones,
policeman
whose
duties
are
quite
similar
to
the
state
police
after
retiring
at
age
65,
even
age
55
from
members
of
the
department
of
public
safety.
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
here
where
they
take
and
remove
this
particular
sub
group
from
age
55
and
require
them
to
retire
at
age
50.
mr.
robert
d.
city
the
language
your
honor
in
the
first
part
of
chapter
32
in
the
definition
section
provides
that
a
man
will
be
retired
for
superannuation.
i
think
the
appendix
will
show
that
the
notice
that
colonel
murgia
received
from
the
board
of
retirement
provides
that
you
will
be
retired
for
superannuation
on
your
50th
birthday.
so
that
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
would
submit
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
this
court
should
be
bound
by
the
purposes
stated
in
the
statute,
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
no
sir.
i
think
there
is
--
i
will
admit
that
there
is
some
dicta
in
some
of
the
cases
in
this
court,
particularly
dealing
with
areas
of
economic
regulation
where
there
is
language
that
if
this
court
can
conceive
of
any
rational
basis
to
support
the
statute
i
would
say
that
that
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
that
burden
remained
on
the
plaintiff
throughout
and
i
think
that
the
district
court
adequately
found
that
we
adequately
carried
our
burden.
mr.
robert
d.
city
well
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
really
a
number
of
issues
in
here.
i
think
this
is
somewhat
of
a
novel
case.
without
any
doubt,
this
is
economic
legislation
and
that
the
commonwealth
has
a
legitimate
right
to
provide
for
retirement
benefits
for
its
employees.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
we
have
here
issues
which
deal
with
age
discrimination.
we
have
issues
here
dealing
with
a
man’s
employment.
i
think
the
fundamental
issue
that
we
are
talking
about
here
which
is
a
personal
right
is
the
right
not
to
be
classified
irrationally
on
the
basis
of
age.
mr.
robert
d.
city
my
position
is
even
under
that
test
your
honor,
there
is
no
rational
set
of
facts
on
the
--
there
is
no
rational
basis
on
the
facts
that
we
have
had
before
us
here.
mr.
robert
d.
city
your
honor
i
will
have
to
maintain
my
position.
i
cannot
--
i
agree
that
that
standard
exist
and
we
--
i
cannot
conceive
of
irrational
basis
we
have
gone
through
a
number
of
hearings
in
this
matter.
i
think
that
any
justification
should
be
permitted
to
be
tested
before
the
bar,
before
the
court
--
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
difficult
standard
if
ultimately
the
justification
for
any
particular
statute
can
rest
on
a
justification
which
this
court
might
simply
conceive
of
at
this
point.
i
think
at
the
very
least
if
that
were
the
case
we
should
be
permitted
the
opportunity
perhaps
to
go
back
to
the
lower
court
and
to
test
and
see
if
in
fact
if
the
justification
suggested
here
is
in
fact
rational.
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
a
rationale
or
an
explanation
for
a
statute
must
withstand
the
scrutiny
of
some
examinations
to
whether
in
fact
it
is
rational.
i
agree.
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
would
submit
to
you
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
that
is
just
the
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
that
is
just
not
a
rational
basis
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
--
on
which
to
make
a
determination.
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
think
that
the—
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
think
as
a
matter
of
the
united
states
constitution
the
classification
which
a
state
makes
in
which
it
selects
to
treat
its
people
has
got
to
have
some
functional
relationship
to
the
job
that
it
seeks
to
accomplish.
mr.
robert
d.
city
no
sir.
i
am
not
quite
saying
that;
i
am
saying
that
the
legislature
may
well
be
able
to
do
that
but
we
have
a
unique
factual
situation
here.
we
in
fact
have
preexisting
individual
testing
and
the
data
which
that
testing
shows,
shows
the
legislature
that
the
classification
that
it
is
making
is
irrational.
so
i
would
like
to
qualify
what
you
said
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
think
that
the
holding
of
the
district
court,
which
is
really
the
only
issue
that
we
have
here
before
us,
says
that
when
the
legislature
is
involved
in
an
admittedly
arbitrary
line
drawing,
which
is
the
classification
here.
and
two,
it
already
has
the
data;
it
is
not
burdened
to
go
out
and
get
it;
it
all
ready
has
the
data
which
shows
that
the
operation
of
that
classification
is
totally
irrational.
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
think
the
record
shows
that
every
single
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
think
that
the
standard
that
is
required
by
the
state
police
is
set
forth
in
its
examination.
mr.
robert
d.
city
mr.
justice
white
i
think
without
any
question
age
is
a
factor
here.
a
man
who
is
50
may
in
some
instance
be
lesser
than
a
man
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
exactly
your
honor.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
though
that
the
standards
which
are
required
to
perform
the
duties
are
fully
met
by
the
testing.
so
that
i
would
submit
that
even
though
a
man
of
50
may
not
be
as
fast
as
a
man
who
is
20,
the
man
who
is
50
so
long
as
he
meets
the
regulations
set
by
the
police,
by
the
state
police
here
is
capable
enough
to
do
his
job
and
i
submit
that
the
difference
that
he
may
experience
personally
between
when
he
was
20
and
when
he
was
50
is
irrelevant
to
his
competence
to
complete
his
job.
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
am
suggesting
that
they
could
recognize
that
except
in
this
instance
your
honor.
i
think
again
we
have
this
individualized
medical
testing
it
belies
at.
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
think
senior
judge
aldrich
said
to
the
legislature
that
is
something
that
you
cannot
do.
if
you
are
going
to
do
that
testing,
then
you
cannot
have
it
both
ways;
you
cannot
have
this
arbitrary
line
that
you
established
at
50
because
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
was
saying.
it
is
a
combination
of
factors
and
i
think
without
the
medical
examination
the
issue
may
not
have
existed.
i
would
like
to
speak
just
briefly
about
the
point
of
the
retirement
benefits
which
has
been
brought
up
here.
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
provision
of
retirement
benefits
is
the
reason
for
the
sub-classification.
i
would
submit
that
on
examination
that
is
just
not
the
case.
we
have
here
state
police
officers
who
are
classified
under
the
statute
as
belonging
to
group
3.
as
officers
under
group
3
they
are
entitled
retirement
benefits.
the
particular
statute
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case
takes
the
members
out
of
group
3
and
puts
them
into
a
classification
which
requires
them
to
retire
five
years
earlier.
since
they
were
all
ready
entitled
to
all
of
the
benefits
in
group
3
and
this
sub-classification
does
not
supply
any
substantially
different
or
additional
benefits,
it
cannot
be
a
justification
for
the
statute
to
provide
this
sub-classification
on
the
basis
that
it
is
providing
for
retirement
benefits
which
are
--
mr.
robert
d.
city
no
your
honor.
i
think
the
legislative
package
here
clearly
shows
that
the
--
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
particular
sub-classification
and
the
statute
in
its
first
one
or
two
sections
sets
out
the
general
terms,
establishes
these
three
general
classifications,
then
we
are
going
to
get
all
the
way
back
to
section
26,
we
find
the
specific
sub-classification
which
is
limited
just
to
members
of
the
uniformed
branch.
so
i
think
we
are
not
talking
about
four
classifications
here,
we
are
really
talking
about
three
classifications,
and
then
a
sub-classification
of
that.
and
i
would
submit
that
if
the
rationale
of
supplying
retirement
benefits
is
a
justification
for
taking
this
sub-classification
out
and
treating
these
members
essentially
different
from
many
others,
then
retirement
statutes,
in
general,
will
simply
be
a
subterfuge
for
the
state
to
practice
age
discrimination.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
d.
city
no
sir.
that
issue
is
not.
