we
are
not
uncomfortable
with
that
either?[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
data
in
the
record
shows
that
men
over
50
do
not
get
tired
quicker,
more
quickly?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
the
men
over
50
do
not
have
the
endurance
than
men
under
50?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
does
a
record
is
the
record
(inaudible)
him
is
the
questions
i
asked
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
we
know
but
some
personal
knowledge
on
this
matter.

byron
r.
white
well,

that
we
are
--
he
should
not
be
entitled
to
add
to
the
possible
qualifications
that
the
state
is
asking
of
its
policemen.
if
they
might
have
thought
that
men
over
50
get
tired
faster
and
if
they
might
have
thought
that
was
an
important
matter
to
consider
in
having
policemen,
can
we
recognize
them?
