we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
massachusetts
board
of
retirement
against

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.

(inaudible)
to
the
existence
of
the
medical
examination
requirement
after
age
40
means
that
a
decisions
had
been
made
that
after
age
40
the
policemen
in
uniform
is
in
a
suspect
class
in
a
sense,
and
they
cut
it
off
at
50
with
a
per
se
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
city.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
not
show
that
the
massachusetts
has
a
view
that
beginning
at
age
40
they
must
check
their
members
of
their
police
force
annually
to
determine
their
fitness
for
duty
and
then
they
cut
it
off
permanently
at
age
50.
is
that
not
the
essence
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
be
here
if
they
had
drawn
it
at
55?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
have
you
answered
my
question,
would
you
be
here
if
the
age
had
been
55?
chief
justice
burger
that
is
for
airline
pilots?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
mean
superannuated
in
relation
to
the
duties
that
are
called
underperformed,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
an
airline
pilot
is
presumed
superannuated
possibly
so
beginning
at
60
and
not
later
i
think
it
is
than
64,
but
lawyers
and
judges
are
not
necessarily
or
librarians
are
superannuated
at
60
or
64
or
65,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
that
a
legislature
of
a
state
cannot
act
on
the
generalization
that
men
over
50
are
not
as
competent
to
perform
rigorous
police
duties
as
men
50
and
under.
that
is
what
you
are
saying,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
they
abolished
all
of
the
medical
examinations
you
would
not
be
here,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
the
reflexes
are
not
as
swift?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
that
not
just
a
matter
of
drawing
different
lines
for
different
functions
in
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
o’malley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

morning,
