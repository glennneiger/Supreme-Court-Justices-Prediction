justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isnâ€™t
one
of
the
purposes
sometimes
advanced
for
these
kind
of
statutes
to
the
desirability
of
avoiding
having
to
make
individualized
determinations
and
tell
officer
smith
that
you
have
to
retire
at
62
because
you
are
not
quite
in
as
good
shape
as
you
used
to
be
but
officer
john
you
can
stay
on
for
three
or
four
more
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
each
officer
mr.
city,
i
have
thought
earlier
someone
said
this
was
not
a
class
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
equal
protection
clause
is
that
if
any
rational
set
of
facts
can
be
conceived
which
would
support
this
legislation,
it
will
be
upheld.
you
say
that
is
economic
legislation
and
what
else
is
this
but
economic
legislation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
is
just
a
on
words,
it
seems
to
me,
and
it
does
not
fit
in
at
all
with
our
equal
protection
decisions
which
justice
stewart
just
reminded
you
of.
let
us
say,
if
any
rational
set
of
facts
can
be
conceived
that
will
support
the
thing
it
will
be
upheld.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
the
question
of
the
facts
we
have
before
us
here
or
the
facts
on
or
the
basis
at
which
the
state
says
it
relied.
it
said,
any
set
of
facts
can
be
conceived
of.
that
is
what
this
court
had
said
time
and
time
again.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
fact;
it
is
a
question
of
constitutional
law.
it
is
not
something
that
you
try
in
the
district
court
and
decide
whether
the
district
court
reaches
a
different
view
than
the
legislature
which
has
the
principal
jurisdiction
over
the
matter.
it
is
a
question,
i
think
of
constitutional
law
and
i
think
that
is
what
those
questions
that
justice
stewart
propound
to
your
mean.
it
is
not
a
question
that
you
need
more
factual
hearings
on.
