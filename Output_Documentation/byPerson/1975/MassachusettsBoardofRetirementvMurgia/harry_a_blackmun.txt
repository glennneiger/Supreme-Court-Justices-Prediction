well
if
someone
came
in
at
age
48
then
he
could
serve
until
68
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
could
he
not?
justice
blackmun
one
more
question
now
that
i
have
interrupted
you.
is
there
any
right
on
the
part
of
the
colonel
here
or
anyone
else
at
age
50
to
transfer
to
some
other
division
of
the
state
police
where
the
retirement
age
is
later?
justice
blackmun
and
you
are
not
uncomfortable
because
everyone’s
pension
is
over
50,
are
you?
justice
blackmun
[laughter]we
are
not
here
for
the
explanations.
justice
blackmun
mr.
o’malley
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
your
system
or
did
not
have
the
built
in
physical
examination.
just
age
50
as
his
retirement
age?
