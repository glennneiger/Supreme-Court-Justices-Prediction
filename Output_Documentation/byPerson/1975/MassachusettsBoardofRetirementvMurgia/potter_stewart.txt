was
this
a
class
action?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
i
asked
because
the
joint
supplemental
memorandum
was
filed
here
by
recently
on
december
8
in
the
case
that
mr.
murgia
has
materially
changed
his
employment,
i
am
reading,
he
is
presently
employed
as
the
security
manager
in
the
westminster,
massachusetts
plant
of
digital
equipment
incorporated.
he
began
this
$17,000
per
year
job,
supervising
a
12-man
security
force
in
august
of
1975.
does
that
indicate
or
imply
that
he
no
longer
is
interested
in
getting
his
job
back
on
the
massachusetts
police
force?
justice
potter
stewart
you
or
at
least
your
side
of
case,
this
is
a
joint
submission,
as
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
thus
i
think
i
feel
free
to
ask
you
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
--
it
is
not
--
it
does
not
imply
that
there
is
a
--
this
case
moot
in
any
way
or
it
is
not.
justice
potter
stewart
what
language
--
what
statutory
language
were
you
referring
to
mr.
city
when
you
said
that
language
makes
--
the
statute
makes
specific
reference
or
it
has
--
and
gave
us
a
specific
reason,
the
hypothesis
that
these
people
were
superannuated?
what
language
were
you
referring
to?
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
assessing
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
state
statute
are
you
suggesting
that
we
are
confined
in
assessing
to
the
reason
that
the
state
gave
for
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
if
we
found
that
perhaps
the
presumption
of
superannuation
might
not
support
this
constitutionally
but
other
factors
or
considerations
might,
we
are
not
bound
by
the
reason
the
state
gave,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
own
suggestiveness
of
the
traditional
and
conventional
constitutional
law?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
presumption
of
course
you
would
agree
whether
that
the
statute
is
valid,
you
rule
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
a
state
just
want
it
all
of
its
placement
not
to
have
gray
hairs
as
a
matter
of
image
or
identification
just
as
a
person
making
a
movie
might
want
to
have
the
lead
roles
played
by
people
who
do
not
have
gray
hair
regardless
of
their
health,
would
that
be
--
and
what
if
a
state
said
any
placement
of
whose
hair
turns
gray
can
no
longer
be
a
policeman
working
for
us
because
we
want
only
people
whose
hair
is
not
gray.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
image
of
our
police
force.
justice
potter
stewart
no
matter
how
healthy.
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
not
it
be?
justice
potter
stewart
what
could
we
make
on
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
a
matter
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
city,
as
i
understand
the
original
complaint
it
also
alleged
sex
discrimination
in
that
women
officers
or
at
least
some
of
them
are
not
required
to
retire
at
age
50.
is
that
issue
still
in
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
