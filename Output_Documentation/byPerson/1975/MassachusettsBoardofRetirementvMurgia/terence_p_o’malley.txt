mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
order
of
a
three-judge
district
court
enjoining
the
enforce
in
the
massachusetts
general
laws,
chapter
32,
section
26,
sub-section
3.
that
statute
requires
that
members
of
the
uniformed
branch
of
the
massachusetts
state
police
retire
upon
reaching
the
age
of
50
or
on
serving
20
years
which
ever
occurs
later.
the
action
was
initiated
by
the
plaintiff,
a
member
of
the
uniformed
branch,
shortly
after
he
was
notified
by
the
board
in
may
of
1972
that
he
would
be
retired
on
his
50th
birthday.
the
complaint
filed
in
the
federal
district
court
essentially
alleged
that
this
statute
denied
him
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
district
judge
who
initially
heard
the
case
dismissed
the
case
for
failure
to
raise
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
district
judge
recognized
the
interest
of
the
commonwealth
insuring
a
high
level
of
physical
capability
of
uniformed
officers
of
the
state
police.
the
court
rules
that
retirement
at
age
50
was
at
least
irrational
if
not
the
only
means
of
achieving
these
purposes.
plaintiff
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
court
remanded
for
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
no
it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
i
have
not
been
informed
to
that
effect
your
honor;
i
am
informally
informed
that
he
would,
if
granted
reinstatement,
retake
his
position
of
the
state
police.
therefore,
i
do
not
believe
the
case
is
moot
or
affected
by
that.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
yes
your
honor
it
was
not
a
--
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
yes
your
honor.
i
do
not
--
i
think
that
evidence,
concerning
his
new
job,
might
relate
to
the
question
of
what
kind
of
effect
retirement
has
on
whether
he
can
get
other
employment
or
not.
this
shows
that
he
can
not.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
certainly,
yeah
there
is
nothing
in
that
joint
supplemental
memorandum
that
the
commonwealth
believed
material
affects
the
case.
we
just
had
the
admonition
of
the
court
in
mind
and
if
any
new
material
does
come
to
light
that
be
presented.
after
the
three-judge
district
court
took
the
evidence
in
documentary
form,
it
issued
an
opinion
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional.
it
stated
that
was
irrational
because
under
state
police
procedures
an
officer
over
the
age
of
40
takes
a
medical
examination
annually.
the
court
ruled
that
this
medical
examinations
were
available
and
did
not
justify
retirement
at
the
age
of
50.
the
court
also
noted
that
the
board
of
retirement
had
not
proved
that
a
critical
area
was
reached
at
age
50
which
would
justify
disregarding
these
examinations.
the
issue
brought
to
this
court
is
whether
mandatory
retirement
of
members
of
the
uniformed
branch
of
the
massachusetts
state
police
contravenes
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
plaintiffs
appear
to
concede
the
retirement
statutes
are
generally
constitutional.
these
are
rational
means
of
effectuating
legitimate
state
purposes.
these
purposes
are
increasingly
inefficiency
of
the
public
service
in
providing
financial
security
for
retired
employees.
there
is
no
reason
to
cover
exception
for
the
retirement
statute
of
the
state
police.
it
is
clearly
rationally
related
to
the
effectuations
of
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
exactly
your
honor.
we
stated
in
our
brief
that
this
is
a
demeaning
and
not
depressing
task
and
is
also
one
taken
in
an
area
of
very
great
medical
uncertainty.
it
is
highly
questionable
whether
the
state
can
actually
quantify
the
degree
of
diminishing
productivity
of
an
individual.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
he
may
not
your
honor
unless—
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
unless
he
has
not
served
20
years
yet.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
he
must
serve
20
years
before
he
is
granted
a
pension.
that
problem
does
not
come
up
in
any
substantial
--
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
historically
your
honor,
about
35
people
have
been
over
the
age
of
50
upon
retirement.
a
large
number
of
that
group
was
kept
on
after
age
50
because
they
are
veterans
in
world
war
ii
and
went
over
the
enlistment
age
and
special
act
was
enacted
so
that
they
could
still
enlist.
there
were
a
few
people
that
were
members
of
the
uniform
branch
before
that
enlistment
statute
was
enacted
in
1939.
so
it
is
very
few
cases
and
there
might
be
a
few
others
where
a
leave
of
absence
was
granted
and
then
an
officer
returned
to
the
service.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
yes.
but
no
one
could
come
in
at
the
age
of
48
now
and
historically
no
one
has
come
in
at
age
48.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
not
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
well
that
has
not
really
come
up.
the
procedures,
joining
the
detective
branch
or
any
other
public
service
job,
are
very
separate
and
there
is
no
particular
statute
which
gives
them
any
particular
rights
to
another
type
of
employment.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
yes
your
honor.
yes,
that
happens.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
there
is
a
--
well
we
have
a
very
comprehensive
retirement
scheme
of
which
are
about
four
basic
groups.
group
1
is
the
general
category
of
employees,
retirement
age
is
70.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
no,
they
are
all
mandatory.
group
2
is
generally
more
hazardous
duties
than
the
average
employee
which
is
65.
group
3
is
the
uniformed
branch
of
the
state
police,
the
age
of
50.
and
group
4
your
honor,
is
essentially
local
policemen
and
firemen
and
so
forth
which
is
age
65.
so
there
are
great
number
of
public
employees
covered
by
retirement
provisions.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
i
am
uncomfortable
your
honor
but
not
essentially
because
of
that.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
the
fact
the
age
for
the
retirement
at
50
is
lower
than
the
general
retirement
age
does
not
justify
carving
out
an
exception
for
the
general
rule
that
retirement
statutes
are
constitutional.
performance
of
the
public
safety
duties
of
the
state
police
requires
a
high
degree
of
strength,
agility
and
stamina.
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
that
the
ability
to
perform
these
functions
can
only
decreases
of
age.
drawing
the
line
at
age
50
is
well
within
the
legislative
discretion
in
setting
a
mandatory
retirement
age.
in
fact
the
district
court
acknowledged
that
the
service
in
the
uniformed
branch
is
significantly
different
from
that
of
other
law
enforcement
groups
in
that
age.
the
fact
that
a
higher
retirement
age
was
set
for
the
state
police
detectives
and
local
police
did
not
provide
the
basis
for
viable
equal
protection
claim.
the
attack
on
the
statute
made
by
the
plaintiff
essentially
is
that
because
there
is
this
medical
examination
procedure,
it
is
irrational
to
use
any
other
procedure
relative
to
retirement.
it
is
very
important
to
note
what
the
medical
examination
does
and
what
it
does
not.
it
has
a
very
limited
function.
as
described
by
the
state
police
surgeon
in
his
testimony,
the
purpose
of
the
examination
is
to
determine
whether
an
officer
has
a
physical
defect
which
would
disqualify
him
from
performing
state
police
duties.
an
example
of
a
temporary
defect
would
be
a
knee
injury
or
a
hernia;
a
permanent
injury
might
be
hypertension
or
cardiovascular
disease.
the
examination
does
not
measure
that
the
decrease
in
strength,
stamina
or
agility
that
generally
occurs
as
one
ages.
nor
does
it
measure
the
rate
of
aging
of
a
functional
age
of
an
officer.
these
are
all
areas
where
there
is
a
great
degree
of
medical
uncertainty
and
the
testing
in
the
area
is
still
in
its
stages
of
infancy.
because
of
this
testimony,
there
is
a
great
degree
of
uncertainty
and
a
legislative
determination
should
be
upheld.
indeed
when
concerning
the
area
of
incurring
disease
is
generally
associated
with
aging.
the
plaintiff’s
expert
and
testified,
that
we
do
not
know
much
about
the
cause
of
most
of
diseases
we
think
of
as
diseases
of
aging.
showing
the
distinct
purposes
of
the
medical
exam
also
shows
the
distinct
purposes
of
the
retirement
statute.
the
medical
is
based
on
definable
medical
conditions
which
may
be
determined
by
a
medical
examination.
the
goal
--
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
the
district
court
ruled
that
because
we
have
the
examinations
available,
the
statute
was
irrational.
we
would
also
state
that
the
statute
would
certainly
be
rational
if
there
were
no
medical
procedures.
in
fact
the
major
point
we
wish
to
make
today
your
honor
that
if
this
statute
is
held
unconstitutional
solely
because
the
state
has
attempted
in
some
manner
to
make
individualized
determination
and
the
effect
would
be
to
hinder
experimentation
and
the
utilization
of
individualized
medical
test.
the
--
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
yes
your
honor.
the
district
court
said
that
we
had
not
proved
that
a
critical
area
was
reached
at
age
50.
the
experience
of
the
state
police
is
that
they
have
examinations
biannually
before
the
age
of
40.
once
they
reach
the
age
of
40,
because
of
the
test
--
as
the
state
police
surgeon
testified,
there
is
a
higher
degree
of
incurring
hypertension
and
other
cardiovascular
diseases,
the
test
must
be
given
annually.
moreover,
the
test
is
also
expanded
to
include
electrocardiograms
and
other
procedures
because
of
the
concern
they
have
with
officers
at
that
age.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
i
think
that
explains
the
opinion
that
he
just
thought
50
was
too
young.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
he
never
really
defined
what
the
critical
area
or
how
it
was
defined.
but
the
first
thing
he
did
note
your
honor
was
that
medical
screening,
individualized
judgments
are
not
only
practicable
but
available.
therefore,
it
is
irrational
to
have
this
overall
cut
off.
and
from
there
he
--
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
if
you
apply
the
analysis
of
the
district
court
to
a
55-year-old
retirement
statute,
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
be
any
different.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
your
honor
with
respect
to
the
other
states
and
their
retirement
statutes,
i
did
note
that
state
of
delaware
has
a
20
year
service
requirement
and
an
officer
must
retire
upon
reaching
serving
20
years.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
yes.
so
that
might
well
work
out
to
be
an
early
retirement
age.
moreover
the
state
of
maine
has
a
25-year
service
requirement
and
if
the
average
age
of
enlistment
is
25,
a
50-year-old
retirement
statute
would
pertain
in
there.
however,
the
state
having
undertaken
these
medical
examinations
is
not
confined
in
merely
removing
the
physically
unfit.
the
retirement
statute
is
a
very
positive
objective
and
that
is
to
remote
the
overall
capability
of
the
force
as
a
whole.
therefore
the
retirement
statute
for
uniformed
members
of
the
state
police
is
irrational
exercise
of
legislative
power
and
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
terence
p.
o’malley
no
your
honor.
