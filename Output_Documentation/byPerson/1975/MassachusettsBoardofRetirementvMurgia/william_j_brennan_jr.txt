justice
jr.
that
may
--
i
am
talking
about
--
probably
tell
us,
that
may,
on
reaching
50,
an
office
be
continued?
justice
jr.
and
not
under
circumstances.
justice
jr.
well,
i
see.
justice
jr.
now,
but
if
he
has
served
20
years
and
reaches
age
50,
he
may
not
be
continued,
there
is
no
process
for
continuing
him,
and
he
must
retire.
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
in
massachusetts
there
are
other
mandatory
retirement
statute,
does
it
not?
justice
jr.
and
now
there
is
one
affecting
judges,
do
you?
justice
jr.
and
some
other
--
justice
jr.
that
is
mandatory.
justice
jr.
mr.
o’malley,
you
are
obviously
--
and
i
thought
(inaudible),
your
summary,
there
is
footnote
90
suggest
70
and
in
the
fact
you
are
talking
about
55
as
every
other
state
has
this
kind
of
law,
mandates
retirement
at
55
rather
than
50.
and
i
thought
largely
they
thought
that
50
was
just
too
young.
justice
jr.
well
thus
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
that
really
is
the
thrust
of
his
invalidation
that
massachusetts
has
to
this
individual
medical
examination
requirement.
justice
jr.
i
believe
it
certainly
sounds
that
50
was
just
irrational
under
any
circumstances.
justice
jr.
that
55
might
be
all
right;
70
certainly
might
be
all
right.
justice
jr.
i
guess
it
is
true,
is
it
not?
he
says
that
a
plaintiff
as
fart
as
the
list
of
statutes
from
which
it
appears
that
massachusetts
is
the
only
state
compulsorily
retiring
police
officers
before
age
55
of
age,
page
28
of
the
jurisdiction
statement.
justice
jr.
even
if
he
is
only
in
his
40’s?
justice
jr.
actually
those
requirements
that
after
40
each
officer
have
a
medical
examination.
i
would
suppose
really
evidence
that
what
the
legislature
thought
was,
you
ought
to
go
at
50,
but
it
maybe
that
you
deteriorate
before
age
50,
between
40
and
50,
and
we
want
to
examine
you
each
year
to
see
if
we
ought
to
let
you
out
before
you
reach
age
50.
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
medical
--
that
they
introduce
the
requirement
of
medical
examination
to
determine
whether
at
50
or
after,
when
they
are
still
capable.
justice
jr.
well
i
gather
if
that
is
what
he
said,
that
is
what
we
--
what
we
have
got
before
is
whether
he
was
right
for
saying
it.
