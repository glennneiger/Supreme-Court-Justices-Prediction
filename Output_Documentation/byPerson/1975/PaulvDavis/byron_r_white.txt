justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
taylor,
you
might
be
able
to
sustain
what
it
is
involved
here
in
the
preliminary
hearing
to
do
the
first,
but
you
still
got
to
go
across
the
notion
that
he
has
a
private
hearing
before
rather
than
after.
certainly,
the
state
gives
him
all
the
hearing
he
needs
after
the
circulation.
you
can
sue
in
court
and
you
get
as
much
of
a
hearing
as
you
want.
do
you
think
constantineau
requires
that
hearing
the
state
extends
be
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
you
have
any
hearing
any
time
there,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
know,
but
you
also
have
to
argue
then
that
it
is
not
enough
to
repair
the
damage
afterwards?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
(inaudible)
that
an
injunction
result
on
the
right
track.
i
suppose
you
would
as
well
as
damages
i
suppose
that
a
plaintiff
could
get
an
injunction
against
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
against
the
police
continuing
to
take
a
proof
that
the
allegation
was
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
irreparable
injury
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
suppose
this
case
was
over
and
he
had
been
found
guilty
and
fined
with
$100.00,
he
paid
the
fine
and
then
the
publication
was
made,
the
circulation
was
made
with
the
words
“active
shoplifter”
on
it
and
he
sued
and
asked
for
an
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
whatever
condition
in
this
case
was?
