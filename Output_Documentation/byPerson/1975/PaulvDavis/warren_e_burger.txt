well,
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
two,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
to
follow
wisconsin
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
the
chiefs
of
police
here

not
purporting
to
follow
any
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
finish
answering
my
question,
we
got
a
chance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

going
contrary.

chief

is
the
constantineau
case
a
1983
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
just
an
action
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
than
it
was.
but
it
was
not
in
1983.
the
thing
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
it
was
not
a
1983
civil
rights
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

a
little
time
left.

you
have
anything
further?

warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
procedural
delay
that
you
had
referred
to,
part
of
some
program
in
kentucky
that
is
generally
called
the
early
diversion
of
cases
that
is
deferral
of
any
prosecution
in
certain
types
of
cases,
first
offender
and
so
forth
or
was
it
just
administrative
inadvertence
that
no
prosecution
proceeded?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
the
application
of
it
though?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
