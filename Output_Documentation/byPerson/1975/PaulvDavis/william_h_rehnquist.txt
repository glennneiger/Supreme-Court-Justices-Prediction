you
do
not
(inaudible)mr.
taylor
base
your
claim
on
a
protection
of
reputation
based
on
kentucky
law.
take
an
example,
if
i
may
say
that
arizona
puts
out
a
arizona
highways
magazine
and
if
they
defame
somebody
in
that
magazine
would
that
give
that
person
who
was
defamed
in
1983
cause
of
action
against
the
editor
of
the
magazine?

(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no
one
found
this
man
guilty
in
official
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
you
just
mentioned
was
directed
to
criminal
proceedings,
directed
at
ultimate
incarceration
of
the
person?
justice
william

rehnquist
but
why
in
answer
to
justice
powell’s
question
when
one
professor
calls
another
man
a
fraud
and
perhaps
accuses
the
most
plagiarism,
why
can
the
same
principle
be
invoked,
if
they
are
state
employees?
justice
william

in
paul
against

no.
74-891,
petitioners
are
two
police
chiefs
in
the
louisville,
kentucky
area.
in
late
1972,
following
a
longstanding
practice
in
their
departments,
they
worked
together
to
produce
a
flyer,
which
contained
names
and
photographs
of
persons
thought
to
have
been
active
as
shoplifters
in
the
louisville
area
over
the
previous
two
years.
some
800
of
these
flyers
were
then
distributed
to
louisville
area
merchants,
so
that
they
might
instruct
their
security
personnel
to
be
on
the
alert
for
those
persons
during
the
then
upcoming
holiday
shopping
season.
respondent’s
name
and
photograph
appeared
on
this
flyer
because
he
had
been
arrested
and
charged
with
shoplifting
in
1971.
that
charge
was
still
pending
at
the
time
the
flyers
were
distributed,
but
shortly
afterwards
the
charge
was
finally
dismissed.
respondent
brought
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
district
of
kentucky
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
claiming
that
the
police
chief’s
actions
had
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
the
district
court
rejected
his
claims
and
respondent
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
reversed
the
district
court
in
order
to
the
respondent’s
complaint
against
the
police
chiefs
reinstated.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
we
agree
with
respondent
that
petitioner’s
actions
were
damaging
to
his
reputation
and
that
he
probably
could
have
established
the
elements
of
a
cause
of
action
against
them
under
the
common
law
of
defamation,
but
for
reasons
stated
in
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
believe
that
one’s
reputation
standing
alone
is
not
an
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
any
harm
which
might
be
caused
by
action
on
behalf
of
a
state.
thus,
we
conclude
that
respondent
is
not
entitled
to
relieve
based
upon
his
claims
of
constitutional
deprivation
but
instead
misrely
on
whatever
remedies
the
state
law
made
for
the
citizens
whose
reputations
have
been,
thus,
damaged.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined
and
in
which
mr.
justice
white
joins
in
part.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
