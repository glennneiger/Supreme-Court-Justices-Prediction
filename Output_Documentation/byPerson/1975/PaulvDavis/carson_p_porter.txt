mr.
carson
p.
porter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners,
the
chief
police
of
louisville,
kentucky
and
jefferson
county,
kentucky.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
factual
situation
which
began
when
the
respondent
was
arrested
for
shoplifting
at
louisville
retail
store
back
in
the
summer
of
1971.
subsequently,
in
september
of
1971,
this
individual
had
his
case
by
his
motion
filed
away
with
leave
which
under
kentucky
law
constitutes
a
general
continuance
of
the
charges
of
shoplifting.
subsequently
in
december
of
1972,
the
petitioners
sent
a
flyer
to
a
number
of
merchants
in
our
community
indicating
that
the
person’s
named
in
that
flyer
had
been
arrested
for
shoplifting
in
the
past
two
years
and
were
“active
shoplifters.”
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
is
the
real
heart
of
the
case.
subsequently,
the
respondent
after
finding
out
about
the
circulation
of
this
flyer
had
the
status
of
his
case
changed
on
his
motion
from
filed
away
from
the
general
continuance
status,
the
criminal
charge
was
changed
to
dismissed.
he
then
brought
an
action
or
attempted
to
do
so
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
and
right
there,
i
think
is
the
knot
of
this
case.
the
question
being
in
short,
did
the
respondent
bring
his
action
in
the
right
court?
we
submitted
to
the
district
court
that
the
respondent
had
failed
to
state
a
claim
under
section
1983.
for,
in
fact,
the
allegations
which
he
set
forth
by
the
factual
circumstances,
i
just
recited
the
statement
of
active
shoplifters.
no
question,
that
is
different
from
his
status
as
an
arrested
person.
but
that
constitutes
in
our
estimation
and
in
the
estimation
of
the
district
court
of
kentucky,
at
best
an
allegation
of
defamation
which
is
cognizable
in
the
circuit
courts
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
and
not
under
1983.
they
contended
in
their
compliant
that
the
right
privilege
or
immunity
which
had
been
denied
to
the
respondent
was
one
of
two
things,
either
(a)
a
deprivation
of
his
constitutional
right
of
privacy
or
(b)
a
denial
of
due
process.
i
would
like
to
focus
the
court’s
attention
if
you
will
firstly,
on
their
allegation
that
this
gentleman
has
been
denied,
he
is
alleged
constitutional
right
of
privacy.
we
basically
submit
it
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
held
in
his
failure
to
state
the
claim
decision
that
the
facts
of
this
case
did
not
give
rise
to
a
constitutional,
protected
right
of
privacy.
and
i
think
the
teachings
of
the
sixth
circuit
since
this
court
--
nobody
in
this
case
has
been
able
to
cite
a
decision
rendered
by
this
court
dispositive
with
this
issue
or
where
this
court
has
recognized
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
in
the
defamation
area.
we
have
of
course
learned
about
griswold
for
married
folks
in
contraceptives
and
eisenstock
for
unmarried
people
and
the
abortion
case
in
roe
versus
wade
but
not
what
we
consider
to
be
primarily,
if
not
totally,
a
defamation
case.
but
the
ninth
circuit
had
a
similar
case.
back
in
1963,
they
decided
in
a
split
decision
york
versus
torrie(ph).
now,
in
that
case
the
majority
held
that
the
factual
circumstances
there
did
in
fact
arise
to
a
constitutional
invasion
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
decision
was
correct
and
i
would
embrace
it
because
the
facts
in
that
case
are
entirely
different
from
the
facts
in
the
case
at
bar.
for
example,
in
york,
a
young
lady
had
gone
to
the
local
police
department
to
complain
about
being
raped.
when
she
got
there,
a
police
officer
acting
as
a
police
officer
took
her
into
a
room,
asked
her
to
strip
nude,
posed
her
and
as
the
court
said,
lured
in
lascivious
poses
and
took
photographs
over
and
then
circulate
the
photographs
to
all
of
his
friends
on
the
police
department.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
that
as
the
court
held
shocked
the
conscience
of
that
court,
shocks
my
conscience
and
i
think
it
would
shock
the
conscience
of
this
court.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
you
are
exactly
right
your
honor.
i
was
drawing
that
case
to
show
what
they
did
in
the
same
circuit
six
years
later
in
a
case
very
similar
to
the
one
at
bar.
baker
versus
howard,
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
held
unanimously
that
the
fact
situation
did
not
arise
to
a
constitutional
deprivation.
therein
in
fact
there
was
proof
that
baker
had
had
a
statement
alleging
that
he
had
committed
a
crime,
broadcast
to
the
general
public
pursuant
to
the
direction
of
the
police
department
over
the
radio
stations
and
had
in
fact
lost
his
job
because
of
this.
i
would
submit
that
to
be
a
potential
denial
of
the
property
right.
the
ninth
circuit
in
that
case
held
did
not
constitute
or
deprivation
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
case
that
was
cognizable
under
section
1983.
now,
in
the
transcript
before
you
in
this
case
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
held
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
the
district
court
denied.
respondent
called
two
witnesses.
they
called
the
employer
of
the
respondent
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
show
to
the
court
the
loss
which
respondent
had
suffered
because
of
this
dissemination.
but
the
best
testimony
that
was
advanced
there
was
that
the
employer
knew
about
it,
had
thought
about
restricting
his
employee’s
activities
as
a
photographer
for
the
local
newspaper
but
in
fact
when
asked
by
the
judge,
“what
had
you
done?”
he
said,
“nothing
your
honor.
i
have
taken
no
action
against
this
gentleman
whatsoever.”
some
interesting
distinctions
between
our
fact
situation
and
baker
versus
howard.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
if
the
teaching
of
baker
versus
howard
is
correct
where
the
gentleman
lost
his
job
because
of
the
dissemination,
and
where
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
proof,
advanced
whatsoever
at
any
type
of
grievous
injury
then
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
case
does
not
even
rise
on
the
hierarchical
ladder
to
baker
versus
howard
much
less
approach,
the
grievous
loss
in
york
versus
torrie.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor,
what
we
are
saying
is
while
we
are
admitting
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
these
actions
were
taken
under
color
of
law
which
put
us
under
the
first
aspect
of
1983.
we
are
submitting
that
we
do
not
and
we
have
not
deprived
the
respondent
of
any
right,
privilege,
or
immunity
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
or
the
federal
laws.
therefore,
since
he
cannot
make
up
a
case,
he
failed
to
state
the
claim
advancing
both
propositions
which
are
required.
we
contend
that
what
he
has
basically
is
a
defamation
case
and
that
he
should
be
suing
us
if
he
wishes
to
do
so
in
the
circuit
courts
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
that
is
the
heart
of
this
lawsuit.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
there
were
121
persons.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
is
the
cover
letter
i
believe
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes
sir
at
page
9
is
a
continuation
of
annex
“a”.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
constituted
the
cover
letter.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
and
as
you
will
note
in
the
cover
letter,
they
made
this
statement
these
persons
have
been
arrested
during
1971
and
1972
which
is
a
factual
statement.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
or
have
been
active
in
various
criminal
fields
in
high
density
shopping
areas.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
the
thrust
of
our
position
being
the
basically
at
best
those
statements
and
the
active
shoplifter
label
constitute
nothing
more
than
a
defamation
claim.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
the
15th
consecutive
year.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
it
has
been
there
since.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
the
businessman
enjoyed
receiving
this
information.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
that
and
part
of
the
thrust
of
our
argument
your
honor
is
that
the
dissemination
itself
constituted
a
legitimate
law
enforcement
dissemination
that
these
persons
are
charged
under
kentucky
statute,
the
store
detective,
the
owner
of
the
store,
and
any
merchants
employee
has
the
right
if
not
the
obligation
to
apprehend
persons,
they
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
are
shoplifting
on
the
premises
of
their
store.
because
of
that
statutory
cloak
of
authority,
we
contend
that
the
dissemination
from
the
police
department
to
these
merchants
was
a
protected
dissemination
within
law
enforcement
or
quasi
law
enforcement
groups.
it
served
a
proper
law
enforcement
function.
the
only
point
which
the
respondent
might
raise
which
would
be
a
legitimate
concern
with
regard
to
this
dissemination
is
that
attachment
of
the
words
“active
shoplifter”
which
i
contend
is
a
gratuitous,
editorial
comment
made
by
the
petitioners
in
addition
to
the
circulation
and
the
dissemination
but
at
best
the
labeling
there
constitutes
nothing
more
than
a
defamation
claim.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no
your
honor,
we
are
not
asserting.
we
did
not
assert
in
this
case,
the
qualified
privilege
as
an
affirmative
defense.
i
would
concur
with
your
analysis
there.
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
that
the
factual
allegations
did
not
set
forth
a
claim
cognizable
under
1983
because
no
privilege
right
or
immunity
enjoyed
by
the
respondent
viz-a-vis,
the
constitution
of
the
federal
laws
has
been
deprived.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes
sir.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
of
course,
i
concur.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
your
honor,
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
and
the
thrust
of
their
opinion
was
on
the
due
process
grounds.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
would
be
delighted
to
do
so
at
this
point
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
concur
with
that
your
honor
and
i
was
attacking.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
the
court
below
rested
its
opinion
largely
on
the
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
situation
wherein
they
were
making
the
thrust
of
their
position
that
because
of
the
labeling
which
took
place
in
the
case
at
bar
is
similar
to
the
posting
and
labeling
in
the
constantineau
circumstances
that
as
they
interpreted
the
constantineau
decision
whenever
that
is
undertaken,
due
process
must
be
entered
into
prior
to
posting
and
labeling.
now
we
would
submit
for
the
court’s
attention
that
three
are
serious
distinctions.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
think
that
is
their
point.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
think
if
that
so,
there
is
no
question
that
it
does
allege
a
violation
of
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
and
my
answer
is
that
with
all
due
respect
for
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
respectfully
dissent
from
their
opinion.
and
that
we
would
draw
the
following
distinctions
between
the
constantineau
application
and
its
application
to
the
case
at
bar.
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
your
honor,
i
would
dismiss
it
for
failure
to
stay
to
claim
and
not
be
cognizable
under
1983
because
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
constantineau
case.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
is
exactly
our
position.
for
the
following
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
struck
down
a
facially
unconstitutional
statute
passed
by
the
wisconsin
legislature
which
said
as
follows
that
a
wife
or
various
members
sheriff,
board
of
mayor
and
so
forth,
a
particular
community
could
by
swearing
out
an
affidavit,
supplying
the
picture
of
their
appropriate
person
have
that
person
without
any
other
further
notice
or
hearing
or
whatever,
the
sheriff
was
mandated
to
take
that
to
every
bar
and
every
liquor
store
in
that
community,
post
it
there
for
the
general
public
to
see,
saying
that
the
person
whose
picture
is
on
this
poster
cannot
be
served
alcoholic
beverages
for
a
period
of
one
year.
in
the
case
of
bar,
we
have
statutory
mandates.
we
have
two
chiefs
of
police
taking
on
their
own
making
a
gratuitous,
editorial
comment
not
pursuant
to
any
kind
of
direction
or
authority.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
did
admit
your
honor
that
it
was
state
action
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
but
i
am
just
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
your
honor
that
but
for
the
fact
that
these
two
gentlemen
were
chief
of
police.
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any
question
but
this
is
nothing
but
a
defamation
case
and
that
there
is
a
factual
distinction
in
that
first
point
between
the
statutory
problem
in
wisconsin
versus
constantineau
and
the
actions
taken
here.
secondly,
though
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
would
say
that.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
well
i
would
say
that
constantineau
situation
is
worse
your
honor
because
the
officials
in
the
constantineau
case
have
no
choice.
when
that
affidavit
was
signed
they
had
to
act
pursuant
to
that
statute.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes
sir.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
think
there
is
two
important
points
about
the
posting.
the
first
office
at
the
wisconsin
posting
was
to
the
general
public
at
large.
the
dissemination
here
was
to
these
group
of
merchants.
secondly,--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor,
she
was
deprived
the
opportunity
to
purchase
liquor
for
a
year.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor,
i
was.
in
focusing
on
the
attachment
of
the
label
act
which
i
believe
was
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
with
regard
to
this
situation
as
distinguished
from
the
constantineau
situation,
we
contend
for
this
court
that
the
respondent
in
this
particular
case
did
not
receive
from
this
type
of
publication
the
attachment
that
was
passed
on
in
wisconsin
versus
constantineau,
for
one
reason
because
of
its
unlimited
circulation.
secondly,
and
i
think
in
analyzing
these
1983
cases
and
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a
claim
asserted
and
when
the
court
takes
evidentiary
proof
on
that
matter
as
they
did
in
this
instance,
respondent
advanced,
his
evidentiary
proof
as
distinguished
from
constantineau,
there
is
not
one
instant
in
the
transcript
of
any
time
when
the
person
has
been
denied
employment
was
he
has
ever
been
stopped
in
the
store
or
has
he
ever
been
asked
about
this?
mr.
carson
p.
porter
it
goes
in
my
estimation
your
honor
and
i
respectfully
submit
it
goes
both
to
the
injury
and
the
potential
damages
to
this
individual
and
whether
or
not
he
has
been
deprived
a
constitutional
right.
that
is
the
reading
of
the
right
of
privacy
cases
from
the
ninth
circuit
to
fifth
and
the
third
circuit
in
rosenberg
versus
martin.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
think
that
is
right
your
honor
as
to
whether
he
is
entitled
to
due
process.
we
refer
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
if
we
did
in
the
due
process
area,
i
think
that
the
question
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
was
one-half
of
the
theory.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
is
the
teaching
of
the
roth
cases
i
understand
it
your
honor
that
unless
he
can
allege
and
assert
a
deprivation
of
liberty
or
property
then
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
is
right
your
honor.
alright
now.
yes
sir.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
consider
that
to
be
fundamental.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
and
grievous.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
that
is
right
your
honor.
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
certainly
do
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no
sir,
your
honor.
our
position
with
regard
to
the
due
process
question
is
basically
is
that
man
entitled
to
a
full
blown
due
process
hearing
prior
to
the
time
when
a
public
official,
in
this
case
two
chiefs
of
police,
make
what
amounts
to
a
defamatory
statement
about
the
gentleman
or
is
due
process
served
by
an
after
the
fact
proceeding
which
we
contend
in
a
defamation
case
is
cognizable
in
the
state
courts.
this
court
recently
in
arnett
versus
kennedy
in
reviewing
the
language
of
the
roth
case
where
there
was
an
obvious
deprivation
of
a
property
interest
and
that
was
a
civil
service
employee
who
had
lost
his
job.
he
pointed
out
that
after
the
fact
to
due
process
remedy
was
appropriate.
that
in
that
procedure
and
i
argue
this
case
only
by
analogy
not
just
as
dispositive
of
our
case,
but
in
that
proceeding,
due
process
not
as
the
respondent
would
urge
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
their
briefs.
but
that
due
process
can
be
provided
adequately
to
this
gentleman
after
the
fact,
not
prior
to
the
time
that
this
type
of
defamation
that
we
can
categorize
it
as
that
is
made
by
these
individuals.
i
think
it
is
important
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no,
your
honor
the
15
years
refers
to
the
15
consecutive
years
when
they
had
sent
a
circular.
the
evidence
is
that
this
is
the
first
time
this
gentleman
had
been
on
the
circular.
but
there
is
no
class
action
before
us
in
this
case
your
honor
so,
my
suggestion
to
the
court
is
very
simply
that
this
case
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
factual
allegations
set
forth
in
the
complaint
and
the
proof
presented
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
transcript.
that
it
should
not
be
given
a
broad
interpretation.
it
should
not
open
the
doors
to
the
federal
court
houses
throughout
this
country
by
attaching
the
constantineau
broad
interpretation
so
that
every
potentially
defamatory
statement
uttered
by
a
public
official
would
be
re-addressable
under
1983.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
under
the
common
law
defamation
remedy.
basically,
in
reviewing
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
assert
to
the
court
that
the
right
of
privacy
having
not
been
recognized
by
this
court
not
elevating
to
in
our
estimation
under
these
factual
circumstances
to
a
constitutional
level
and
in
our
estimation
inappropriate
application
of
constantineau
to
the
facts
at
bar
wherein
the
liberty
and
property,
procedures
and
application
of
due
process
have
not
been
attached
to
this
gentleman
that
under
these
circumstances,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
they
may
have
a
defense
of
qualified
privilege
your
honor,
that
point
of
course
has
not
been
brief
or
address
in
anywhere
in
this
lawsuit
to
date.
but
that
defense
would
probably
be
raised.
i
think
that
the
case
law
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
in
that
area
is
not
what
i
could
say
to
the
court
is
absolutely
clear
and
if
we
would
raise
that
defense
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no
question
about
that
your
honor
and
the
traditional
truth
is
defense
–-
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no
question
about
that.
the
issue
in
this
case
though
is
whether
that
injury
to
his
reputation
arises
to
a
constitutional
deprivation.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor
and
we
contend
and
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
not
and
that
the
decision
of
this
court
should
take
the
opportunity
to
carve
out
this
set
of
factual
circumstances
from
the
broad
scope
of
the
constantineau
in
roth
language
and
leave
the
appropriate
remedy
in
the
state
courts
for
persons,
define
themselves
in
the
circumstances.
thank
you.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
couple
of
points
which
i
should
like
to
address
the
court’s
attention.
what
i
think
falls
in
the
area
of
what
i
like
to
characterize
as
a
factual
misstatement
by
my
learned
colleague,
mr.
taylor
in
analyzing
the
status
of
filed
away
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
and
putting
it
in
the
proper
context
of
this
particular
litigation.
one
of
the
interesting
points
is
that
this
gentleman
at
that
time
the
dissemination
was
made
was
in
a
status
where
his
case
was
subject
to
being
reopened.
it
was
not
until
after
the
dissemination
was
made
that
mr.
taylor
came
to
the
local
police
court
and
petitioned
for
dismissal
of
the
charge.
the
second
and
most
important
thing,
i
would
like
follow
up
on
is
mr.
justice
powell’s
comments
regarding
prior
restraint
on
a
significant
first
amendment
freedom
of
these
two
particular
chiefs
of
police.
the
question
really
being
in
the
end
result
is
this
court
going
to
say
to
the
factual
circumstances
presented
here
today
that
before
these
petitioners
made
these
editorial
and
potentially
defamatory
remarks
about
this
respondent,
they
had
to
hold
a
full
evidentiary
due
process
hearing
or
as
we
respectfully
submit
and
petition
the
court
to
adapt
the
proposition
that
the
proper
remedy
lies
in
the
circuit
courts
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
for
defamation.
thank
you
your
honor
and
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
in
state
court
proceedings?
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes,
your
honor.
injunctive
relief
would
lie.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
yes
sir.
we
adapted
the
civil
rules
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
that
the
temporary
restraint
order
could
be
issued
to
prevent
the
further
dissemination
of
this
particular
articles
are
at
least
with
the
words
active
shoplifters
attached
to
this
dissemination.
that
kind
of
injunctive
relief
could
lie.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no,
your
honor
it
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
kentucky
law
where
the
respondent
in
this
case
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
well,
according
to
the
transcript
that
was
presented
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
there
were
no
prosecuting
witnesses
present
at
the
time.
the
respondent
made
the
motion
that
his
case
be
filed
away
instead
of
making
the
motion
that
it
be
in
fact
dismissed.
no
question
he
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence,
but
in
kentucky
we
make
a
distinction
between
dismissal
filed
away
and
convicted
and
there
is
a
procedure
whereby
a
criminal
defendant
can
instead
of
a
asserting,
i
want
to
have
my
day
in
court,
i
want
to
have
a
trial,
i
want
to
be
dismissed,
can
say
to
the
court
and
it
would
be
granted
by
the
court
as
it
was
in
this
instance
that
i
would
like
to
have
my
case
filed
away
with
general
leave
to
be
reopened.
obviously
when
a
case
is
in
that
category,
the
police
have
to
retain
the
arrest
records
in
their
file
or
there
would
not
be
a
file
upon
which
the
case
could
subsequently
be
reopened
and
that
was
the
status
of
the
respondent’s
position
on
the
date
of
this
dissemination.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
no
sir,
your
honor.
there
is
no
particular
standard.
it
is
basically
a
presentation
of
the
circumstances
to
the
court
and
first
off
in
the
case
cited
in
the
brief
in
arsdale
v.
caswell,
it
cannot
be
done
unless
the
defendant
concurs.
mr.
carson
p.
porter
i
think
your
honor
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
defamation
relief
even
under
those
circumstances
because
--
mr.
carson
p.
porter
basically,
i
would
concur,
except
i
wanted
to
correct
what
i
perceive
to
be
in
this
statement
of
the
status
of
that
provisional
in
the
law.
thank
you
your
honor.
