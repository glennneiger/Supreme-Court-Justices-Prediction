justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
taylor,
as
you
get
into
the
constitutional
issue
which
as
you
said
it
does
interest
me.
i
note
that
as
near
as
i
can
tell
in
your
brief,
you
do
not
use
the
word
liable
at
all.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do
not
mention
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
finish
my
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
use
different
terminology
quite
different
for
the
aclu,
punishment
without
a
prior
due
process
hearing.
is
it
your
basic
position
that
whenever
an
employee
of
a
state
or
city
utters
any
words
that
may
possibly
be
defamatory
that
under
a
new
doctrine
of
prior
restraint
there
must
be
a
due
process
hearing?
what
is
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
your
position,
restraint
or
prior
restraint.
for
any
state
or
county
or
city
employee
says
anything
libelous
about
anybody
else
in
the
course
of
his
duties.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
if
you
would
address
that,
i
will
appreciate
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
taylor,
if
you
were
the
lawyer
accused
of
using
falsified
testimony,
would
you
not
consider
that
rather
raw
also.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
said
this
was
a
raw
case
and
you
used
that
to
distinguish
the
case
that
i
put
to
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
put
another
one
to
you.
this
may
be
easier
for
you.
could
any
state
support
television
educational
programs?
suppose
that
a
professional,
a
state
tv
program
was
discussing
the
history
book
written
by
another
profession,
and
was
critical
of
it
and
in
the
course
of
that
discussion
on
educational
television,
he
said,
this
professor
was
really
a
fraud
and
was
widely
known
to
use
erroneous
false
information
in
his
textbooks.
a
1983
jurisdiction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no
prior
restraint
in
that
situation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
one
final
question?
do
you
perceive
any
impairment
of
first
amendment
rights
of
employees
of
state
and
local
governments
by
this
due
process
theory
of
yours
requiring
as
a
prior
restraint
to
prior
due
process
hearing
before
they
indulge
in
common
law
defamation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
my
concern
is
whether
or
not
your
position
does
not
run
head
on
into
the
first
amendment?
i
am
not
talking
about
ultimate
right
to
recover
damages.
i
would
be
with
you
all
the
way
on
that
in
this
case
of
course,
but
you
are
arguing
for
a
position
of
prior
restraint
of
the
first
amendment
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
on
the
egregious
case,
but
there
are
lot
of
cases
that
are
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
warring
publicly
on
educational
television?
