mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
begin
to
set
the
record
i
believe
a
little
bit
more
correctly
before
the
court
because
some
of
the
justices
indicated
that
it
was
perhaps
or
at
least
the
inquiry
run
is
to
well
had
there
been
any
damage
to
davis
per
se.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
may
i
please
refer
this
court,
and
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
response
that
the
employer
of
davis
gave
its
very
last
page
of
the
appendix
and
if
i
may
it
is
very
brief.
just
read
directly
the
question,
“as
a
result
of
the
flyer,
did
you
feel
that
you
might
have
to
possibly
limit
the
places
that
he
would
possibly
and
the
future
go
in
as
a
member?”
by
that
they
mean
of
course
the
news
staff.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
am
at
page
35
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
in
the
appendix,
the
numeration,
right
at
the
very
end.
mr.
justice
stewart
it
is
35.
thank
you.
the
answer
very
definitely
i
would
question,
and
why
did
you
feel
that
way
and
i
read
directly
now
from
the
proof
adduced
before
the
trial
court
at
the
seeking
of
the
preliminary
injunction
which
was
denied
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
“our
photographers
must
be
accepted
as
reasonably
honorable
and
truthful
man
whenever
they
go,
wherever
they
go.
i
felt
that
in
view
of
this
flyer
circulation
to
merchants
of
the
community.
i
could
not,
for
example,
assign
mr.
davis
to
photographing
anything
in
a
mercantile
establishment
and
so
that
should
such
an
assignment
come
up,
i
would
have
been
forced
to
have
someone
else
cover
that
assignment
rather
than
mr.
davis.”
now
if
i
might
--
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
yes,
of
course.
question,
that
is
all
and
the
court
said,
“by
the
court
did
you
restrict
him?”
the
question
was
from
the
bench.
the
witness
says,
“no,
i
did
not.”
by
the
court,
you
have
not
restricted
him
at
all.
the
witness,
“i
have
not
restricted
him
at
all.”
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
if
you
please
mr.
justice,
the
situation
had
not
come
up.
here
is
the
young
man’s
employer
saying
that
he
cannot
send
this
youngster,
he
is
a
college
student,
young
black
photographer,
what
he
was,
into
a
mercantile
establishment
because
he
does
not
have
the
proper
bona
fide
he
stood
at
this
spot
on
his
sketching.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
this
was
taken
in
january.
the
flyer
was
circulated
in
december.
there
was
--
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
there
had
been
possibly.
i
appreciate
that
question.
it
is
hard
to
say,
it
had
not
come
up
but
indeed
it
had
come
up
and
if
i
might
please
suggest
most
respectfully
that
the
very
question
that
your
honor
has
asked
points
out
that
the
wide
dissemination
of
this
flyer,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
in
his
question,
how
many
of
them
were
there?
let
me
say
to
this
court,
there
were
800
of
them.
let
me
say
to
this
court,
they
not
only
went
in
louisville,
they
went
across
the
river
into
what
we
call
atria
cities
in
the
indiana.
let
me
say
that
the
qualification
for
getting
hold
of
one
of
this
and
it
is
in
the
record
from
the
chief
of
police
was
to
go
to
the
police
department
and
knock
on
the
door
and
get
your
yearly
flyer
and
so
forth.
this
was
another
thing.
this
flyer
itself
on
that
cover
sheet
annex
“a”
says
a
great
deal
more
than
my
learned
colleague.
it
says
and
i
am
quoting
directly.
we
have
approved
and
attached
alphabetically.
this
is
of
course
in
our
appendix
arrange
flyer
of
subjects
known
to
be
active
in
this
criminal
field.
the
papers
themselves,
the
pictures
at
the
top
do
not
say
anything
about
this
man
has
been
arrested.
they
say
active
shoplifters.
it
is
a
fait
accompli.
there
is
no
future
determination.
there
is
no
notice.
there
is
no
confrontation.
the
trap
has
prompt
and
with
it
the
imputation
that
that
man,
not
the
imputation
that
the
man
is
a
criminal,
but
the
conclusion,
the
statement
official
state
action
to
the
police
department.
my
opponent
says
arguendo,
it
was
state
action
possibly
arguendo,
de
facto
and
realistically
and
actually
in
any
way
you
want
to,
pardon
me,
slice
it.
it
was
state
action
and
our
police
department
not
knowing
they
are
wrong
take
credit
at
the
bottom
of
this
paragraph
for
the
offense
against
this
young
man.
these
flyers
preparation
is
accredited
to
officers,
small
thing
to
take
credit
for.
i
would
suggest
this
court
would
perhaps
want
to
hear
more
about
the
constitutional
aspect
of
this
case
and
prepare
to
proceed
further
in
that
regard.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
hardly.
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
the
reason
i
was
opposing
was
to
try
to
give
you,
i
say
i
was
opposing
to
try
to
give
you
a
reasoned
answer.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
thank
you.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
powell
that
when
criminality
is
imputed,
i
believe
that
when
by
state
action
now,
absent
a
consideration
of
private
acts
and
so
forth
by
state
action
that
when
one
is
in
indiscriminately
lumped
into
a
criminal
quays
and
taken
as
having
being
convicted
when
the
mere
fact
of
arrest
is
all
that
is
involved
that
constantineau
mandates
a
reasonable
notice
that
this
is
not
contemplated
to
be
set
against
man
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
i
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
of
course
upon
which
constantineau
is
grounded
directs
that
this
must
be
the
case
therefore
is
kind
of
a
lengthy
answer.
but
my
answer
most
respectfully
would
have
to
be
yes
to
the
justice.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
baker
is
helpful
in
this
and
so
is
york
where
they
talk
about
an
abuse
can
be
so
gross.
and
i
might
add
that
in
the
brief
for
petitioner
it
was
stated
somewhere
along
the
line
that
katz
v.
united
states,
says
there
is
no
general
constitutional
right
to
privacy
as
what
they
wrote.
it
did
say
that.
but
it
also
did
say
as
baker
and
the
other
cases
that
it
is
a
question,
perhaps
of
the
heinousness
of
the
offense.
now,
therefore
i
respond
that
we
are
talking,
i
believe
about
a
matter
of
degree.
i
do
not
believe
that
every
time
someone
if
you
pardon
me
badmouths
someone
that
there
are
automatically
into
a
situation
of
constitutional
proportions.
i
think
what
i
would
emphasize
in
the
case
at
bar
is
that
here
you
had
the
christmas
season,
you
had
800,
but
wide
dissemination
and
i
mentioned
that
already
and
the
broadcast
aspect
and
what
was
called.
i
could
not
help
but
reflect
a
minute
ago
when
the
distinction
was
being
made
of
that
constantineau
that
if
one
had
a
choice,
i
would
rather
be
reprobated
as
a
drunk
than
a
thief.
no,
i
am
not
trying
to
be
humorous
or
in
any
way
when
i
say
that.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
no,
if
it
please
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
it
was
directly
appealed
from
a
three-judge
panel
which
had
held
the
statute.
it
was
wisconsin’s
state
statute
so
it
must
have
been
a
three-judge
panel
proceeding
originally
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
may
i
respond
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
believe
that
--
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
mr.
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
it
is
a
1983
action
but
i
know
it
was
a
statute
held
unconstitutional
then
i
believe
by
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
if
that
is
how
it
worked.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
would
not
see
that
fact
situation
as
similar
to
this.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
may
i
distinguish
why
with
your
permission.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
interesting
that
baker
had
the
first
amendment
aspect
as
you
recall
where
the
distinction
in
baker
was
made
because
i
mean
they
do,
police
officers
have
a
right
to
communicate
it.
we
are
not
supposed
to
have
opinion.
it
is
a
different
case.
i
believe
that
what
is
so
significant
here
are
the
facts
in
this
case.
they
are
wrong.
here
is
a
man
never
convicted
of
anything.
he
is
only
prior
arrested
for
speeding
and
write
away
thousands
of
copies
and
a
young
man
starting
his
life
distributed
in
his
area
not
any
inference
or
innuendo
but
the
plain
active
branding
of
criminality
by
state
action.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
would
i
consider
it
raw?
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
believe
i
would
mr.
justice
powell
but
i
think
in
considering
my
remedies,
i
would
not
feel
that
i
was
in
a
comfort,
in
a
position.
it
had
a
constitutional
statute
in
the
situation.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
your
honor
i
think
that
you
have
some
other
aspects
of
law
there.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
you
have
state
action
that
you
have
under
color
of
state
law
and
the
abridgment
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
was
going
to
add
a
little
more
to
that
sentence.
i
was
saying.
pardon
me
your
honor.
as
i
understand
its
basic,
its
black
letter
law
for
1983
action,
you
need
under
color
of
state
law
and
the
abridgment
of
a
right
guaranteed
a
right,
privilege
or
immunity
by
the
constitution,
that
i
respectfully
submit
is
where
the
fourteenth
amendment
becomes
so
important
in
these
type
of
proceedings.
so
now
people
have
opinions.
may
i
perhaps
shortcut
and
say
some
time
for
all
us
by
saying.
it
is
one
thing
for
professor
“a”
to
say
professor
“b”
is
a
fraud.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
thank
you.
i
was
suggesting
that
one
college
professor
imputing
to
another
is
being
a
fraud,
is
vastly
a
different
case
from
the
combined
police
departments.
in
the
christmas
season
for
15
years
to
run
indiscriminately
through
their
arrest.
i
say
indiscriminately
because
i
am
in
those
cities
and
counties
in
practice
and
can
assure
this
court
that
there
are
more
arrests
with
this
offense
than
the
112
appearing
here.
they
just,
it
is
just
sort
of
their
gift
to
the
community
at
least
that
is
how
they
saw
it,
you
see
and
i
think
that
is
tragic
and
sad
thing
really,
like
where
they
took
credit
here.
credit
for
what?
for
calling
an
innocent
man
all
this
number
of
times
a
criminal.
the
constitutional
argument,
i
think
also
should
give
a
good
deal
of
thought
to
just
the
most
basic
premise
in
american
criminal
jurisprudence,
the
absolute
bedrock,
the
one
axion,
the
one
room
that
every
school
child
learns
and
that
of
course
i
am
referring
to
the
presumption
of
innocence.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
with
all
respect
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
police
department
tried
him
in
there.
they
have
characterized
him
as
active
in
this
field.
they
have
printed,
how
else
do
you
communicate
in
a
brochure,
the
picture
and
the
language
described
in
relates.
they
say
thief.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
think
a
presumption
of
innocence
is
shared
and
possessed
by
all
of
us
at
all
stages
in
our
life
and
in
the
proceeding
of
a
criminal
case.
it
is
a
basic
thing.
what
we
were
talking,
we
were
trying
to
reach
the
constitutional
aspect
of
our
fact
situation
here.
in
other
words,
did
davis
have
standing?
well,
we
submit
in
behalf
of
respondent
davis
that
he
had
standing
constitutional
standing
because
of
his
constitutional
presumption
of
innocence.
now,
i
freely
concede
that
the
magic
language,
presumption
of
innocence
is
not
in
an
adjective
way
spelled
out
in
the
constitution,
but
i
further
say
to
you
your
honors
that
substantively
and
from
the
beginning
of
this
court,
that
right
has
assumed
and
has
always
enjoyed
and
should
most
certainly
enjoy
constitutional
statute.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
i
think
possibly,
one
might
want
to
consider
a
bit.
you
almost
walk
the
area
of
bad
faith
you
know.
but
may
i
point
is
that
to
the
justice,
this
police
department
had
within
its
own
building,
the
records
that
it
could
determine
by
going
right
downstairs,
what
disposition
has
been
made
in
and
may
i
further
say
just
to
correct
another
thing
here?
in
my
state,
a
finding
of
filed
away
is
not
some
sort
of
--
filed
away
with
leave
some
sort
of
indefinite
continued
or
anything.
i
really
do
not
think
that
we
have
to
reach
that.
i
think
that
the
appendix
will
show
the
order
of
the
court.
i
think
it
is
an
anomaly
that
should
be
done
away
with,
but
nonetheless
we
have
to
deal
with
it.
in
kentucky,
you
are
entitled
to
insist
on
a
final
determination
of
your
case
which
i
did
for
davis.
i
did
it
myself,
first
time
i
did.
the
reason
being,
the
reason
i
did
it
was
after
i
saw
that
he
was
being
characterized
as
a
thief
then
he
had
to
get
the
matter
resolved.
he
had
to
enforce
his
right
and
demand
that
the
case
be
dismissed,
but
i
thought
there
might
have
been
some
misapprehension
on
that
point.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
practice.
it
is
followed
in
too
many
states.
it
is
middle
ground,
this
limbo
between
convictions,
but
there
is
no
way
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
can
claim
that
davis’
case
had
ever
been
brought
to
conviction
at
the
time
they
ran
this
about
him?
i
have
just
very
brief
two
or
three
more
minutes
if
there
would
be
any
question.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
may
i
respond
that
i
understand
what
you
asked
me
is
indeed
--
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
yes.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
of
course
this
is
a
case
of
where
--
i
think
i
must
come
back
to
your
analogy
of
your
question
a
couple
of
minutes
ago
about
the
professors.
two
professors
warring
within
the
groves
of
academe
is
one
thing.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
that
is
right.
it
is
a
matte
of
fact
that
might
also
be
expected,
but
to
take
a
man’s
good
name,
his
future,
what
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
say?
life,
liberty,
and
property.
i
suggest
that
he
has
a
liberty
interest
in
the
jobs
he
might
want
to
take,
his
property.
there
is
another
great
quote
in
that
appendix
that
says,
“oh!
it
is
in
the
appendix.
he,
davis
had
better
watch
his
step.
next
time
he
is
going
to
send
the
appendix.”
the
page
right
before
your
reading.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
a
i
read
constantineau,
no.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
but
of
course,
the
statue
was
abrogated.
it
was
kind
of.
there
is
a
parallel
between
constantineau
in
our
case
because
the
damage
that
was
done
by
the
time
they
got
to
court,
what
happened
to
that
statute
has
been
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
oh!
you
take
what
you
can
get
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
respectfully
respond
to
you
that
constantineau
mandates,
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
the
state
maligns
the
character
and
good
name
of
the
citizen
that
is
what
i
believe.
mr.
daniel
t.
taylor,
iii
that
is
true.
i
am
reminded
for
some
strange
reason
of
the
famous
oscar
wilde
case
of
i
think
possibly
that
i
am
too
hard
on
the
professors.
maybe
if
i
represented
the
professors
that
they
have
as
much
right
to
their
expertise
and
their
reputation
and
their
character,
but
if
mr.
justice
powell
had
said
what
if
one
professor
had
called
the
other
a
criminal,
plus
here
is
another
thing,
we
have
all
seen
in
the
media
where
an
opportunity
is
given
for
a
person
to
express
his
views
and
this
court
has
pronounced
the
law
in
that
area
within
the
last
couple
of
years
and
so
forth.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
public
radio
and
the
media
is
any
proof
at
all
or
guarantee
for
what
they
produce.
here
we
have
state
action
in
davis’
case
purposely
done,
more
than
carelessly
done,
done
i
think
in
bad
faith
and
i
think
under
constantineau,
as
a
question
was
that
they
just
simply
cannot
do
it.
it
is
just
basically
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
--
it
is
i
think
a
very
traditional
and
uncomplicated
case.
no
person
shall
be
deprived
by
state
action
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
we
have
not
had
a
trial,
a
case
or
anything
in
the
case
instant
at
bar
as
yet.
the
case
was
reversed
at
the
sixth
circuit.
it
happened
and
i
have
argued.
the
case
is
now
before
your
honors
and
so
forth.
as
this
court
rules,
we
will
determine
the
final
chapter
no
matter.
may
i
thank
you
again.
