unknown
speaker
it
is
so
but
you
do
not
need
to
concede
the
correctness
of
that
decision.
it
may
have
shocked
all
of
our
consciences
but
it
may
not
have
been
violation
of
any
constitutional
rights.
in
other
words,
we
do
not
have
that
case
before
us.
unknown
speaker
well
supposing
that
there
had
been
an
inadequate
showing
in
your
view
of
significant
loss.
as
i
read
your
brief,
your
contention
is
that
nonetheless
if
the
loss
itself
is
not
imposed
by
the
sovereign
power
of
the
government
then
it
is
not
cognizable
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
his
diversity
or
citizenship
i
suppose
you
could
see
on
the
federal
court
unknown
speaker
were
about
a
115
of
these
people
pictured
as
active
shoplifters?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
looking
in
what
was
reproduced
here
in
the
appendix
about
half
or
more
are
women,
along
with
this
annex
“a”
that
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
8
was
that
distributed
to
the
businessman
too?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
the
material
on
page
9.
was
that
distributed
also
to
the
louisville
businessman?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
or
have
been
active?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
testimony
was
that
this
had
been
done
repeatedly
at
the
christmas
season?
unknown
speaker
and
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
businessman
when
they
did
not
get
their
copy
of
this
would
call
the
police
headquarters
say,
“are
you
not
going
to
do
it
again
this
year?”
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
question
of
privilege
that
you
would
not
be
able
to
raise
a
motion
to
dismiss,
is
it
not?
if
your
only
ground
were
to
say
that
even
though
the
states
are
claimed
under
1983,
we
nonetheless
were
privileged
because
we
were
engaged
in
legitimate
law
enforcement
activity.
you
would
not
be
able
to
get
the
complaint
dismissed
where
you
are
asserting
a
qualified
privilege
that
may
depend
on
subjective
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
quite
independent
--
unknown
speaker
--
from
your
position
that
it
is
legitimate
law
enforcement
activity
that
your
clients
were
engaged?
unknown
speaker
even
through
a
defamation
action
that
will
be
an
effective
defense?
unknown
speaker
on
what
ground
does
this
court
below
proceed,
was
it
on
due
process
grounds?
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
it
was
procedural
due
process
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
addressed
that
yet.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
before
you
can
say
it
was
1983
act,
you
have
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
properly
alleged
that
a
deprivation
of
procedural
due
process.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
then
that
the
court
below
--
did
the
court
below
suggest
that
even
with
proper
procedures,
the
officials
could
have
not
done
this?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
actually
after
going
all
through
label
carries
with
it
as
it
describes.
all
of
this
was
done
without
the
slightest
regard
for
due
process.
there
was
no
notice
or
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
distribution
of
the
flyer
and
the
appellate
and
others
have
never
been
afforded
the
opportunity
to
refute
the
charges
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
now,
do
i
correctly
read
that
and
saying
that
in
what
was
done
here,
there
was
a
denial
of
federal
procedural
due
process?
unknown
speaker
now
if
that
is
so,
does
that
not
allege
a
violation
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
and
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
not
mean
to
say
that
constitution
of
1983
this
means
that
if
you
dismiss
it
will
fail
you.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
agree
with
the
sixth
circuit
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
can
govern
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
admitted
that
this
was
state
action
on
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)on
their
own,
they
took
it
on
part
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
for
that
reason
in
constantineau
that
what
was
done
was
done
on
the
authority
of
the
statute
of
legislature.
here
you
have
a
couple
of
police
officials
that
will
just
do
this
out
of
thin
air
with
no
--
unknown
speaker
that
is
worse
in
the
situation.
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
state
of
kentucky
attach
any
disabilities
to
these
people,
the
way
that
said
it
was
consented
to
the
person
was
posted
simply
as
a
result
of
the
circulation
of
this
flyers?
unknown
speaker
all
that
happened
was
when
it
was
posted
they
could
not
sell
the
lady
any
drinks
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
at
least
that
was
to
go
through
the
rest
of
their
lives
accusations
apparently
untrue
that
they
were
active
shoplifters.
unknown
speaker
more
accurately
do
you
not
mean
whether
or
not
he
has
been
deprived
of
liberty
or
property?
unknown
speaker
that
is
where
we
are,
is
it
not?
that
was
the
theory
of
this
complaint
was
it
not.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit
decided
the
case?
unknown
speaker
so
the
question
is
even
though
if
he
had
been
deprived
of
liberty
or
property,
what
happened
here
might
have
been
a
violation
of
due
process
or
the
procedural
due
process
rights.
the
first
inquiry
is
whether
he
has
been
deprived
of
liberty
and
property
because
unless
he
has
been,
then
he
has
not
been
deprived
of
what
is
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
by
the
state
of
liberty
or
property?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
i
have
given
you
much
of
a
chance
to
argue
your
case
but
maybe
i
can
help
you.
in
constantineau,
the
party
was
deprived
of
a
very
fundamental
right
of
liberty.
he
was
not
allowed
to
buy
whiskey
for
a
year.
unknown
speaker
[laughter]right.
unknown
speaker
alright.
now
in
this
case,
there
was
no
deprivation
of
anything
as
shown
by
the
record.
unknown
speaker
but
does
not
evidence
totally
back
that
up?
unknown
speaker
because
your
contention,
is
there
any
evidence
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
this
is
after
15
years,
right?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one?
unknown
speaker
under
the
kentucky
law
in
a
defamation
state
defamation
suit
against
these
police
officers,
would
they
have
defensive
privilege?
unknown
speaker
i
think
in
kentucky
at
least
historically
has
been
a
defamation
to
accuse
some
persons
falsely
being
a
criminal.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
is
that
it
injures
his
reputation,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
deprivation
of
liberty
or
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
that
there
had
been
damage.
has
there
been
a
deprivation
of
liberty
or
property?
unknown
speaker
will
you
read
on
mr.
taylor?
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
no
restrictions?
unknown
speaker
how
long
after
the
flyer
was
circulated,
was
this
evidence
taken?
unknown
speaker
and
there
had
been
no
restriction
in
the
end,
anytime?
unknown
speaker
when
was
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
taylor.
unknown
speaker
you
asked
the
question
indicating
that
whether
or
not
1983
would
apply
to
confer
a
federal
jurisdiction
would
depend
on
the
degree
of
the
defamation.
let
me
put
up
a
couple
of
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
that
the
(inaudible)
the
police
department
in
louisville.
i
do
not
know
whether
they
have
one
or
not
to
let
us
assume
that
they
do
have
a
little
magazine
that
comes
out
once
a
month
and
let
us
assume
it
had
a
story
about
defense
counsel
and
it
named
a
well-known
defense
counsel
and
said
he
had
a
habit
of
using
perjury
testimony.
would
that
support
a
1983
case?
would
it
require
a
prior
due
process
hearing
before
the
story
was
published?
unknown
speaker
not
similar.
unknown
speaker
of
course.
unknown
speaker
no
state
action
in
teaching
classes.
what
about
those?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
counsel,
you
get
along
better
with
that
microphone
if
you
will
stay
about
six
or
eight
inches
away
from
it.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
do
you
distinguish
mr.
justice
powell’s
inquiry
about
the
two
professors,
we
are
assuming
there
state
maligning
and
there
is
just
of
much
of
a
good
name
that
issue
there
as
here?
