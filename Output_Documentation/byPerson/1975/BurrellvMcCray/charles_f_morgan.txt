mr.
charles
f.
morgan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
maryland
is
asking
the
court
for
a
decision
on
the
broad
question
of
whether
a
maryland
prisoner
maybe
required
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies
in
an
action
properly
bought
under
42
u.s.c.
1983,
alleging
violations
of
constitutional
rights.
the
fundamental
defect
in
the
state's
argument
is
that
the
asserted
remedy,
the
maryland
inmate
grievance
commission
is
not
an
adequate
administrative
remedy
under
the
circumstances
of
these
cases.
in
addition
the
state
misconceives
the
proper
role
of
this
court
in
asking
that
an
exhaustion
requirement
be
judicially
grafted
on
to
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
whether
the
exhaustion
administrative
remedies
doctrine
is
to
be
made
applicable
to
1983
cases
is
a
matter
for
congress
and
not
the
courts
to
decide.
the
cases
before
the
court
do
not
present
a
proper
vehicle
for
a
ruling
on
a
broad
constitutional
question
urged
by
the
state.
the
facts
require
only
a
holding
that
there
is
no
adequate
administrative
state
remedy
for
these
plaintiffs.
even
in
the
case
where
exhaustion,
even
in
the
case
where
the
exhaustion
doctrine
is
recognized
to
apply,
exhaustion
is
not
required
if
the
proposed
remedy
is
found
to
be
inadequate
or
if
the
purposes
of
the
doctrine
will
not
be
served.
these
cases
present
exactly
that
situation.
first
with
regards
to
milton
mccray
separate
actions
against
mr.
burrell
and
mr.
smith,
the
only
relief
sought
by
mccray
in
these
cases
is
damages
for
being
subjected
to
violations
of
his
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out
mccray
does
request
damages.
however,
he
was
incorrect
in
stating
that
mccray
requested
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
in
those
cases.
if
i
may
refer
the
court
specifically
to
the
appendix,
pages
12
and
16
are
mccray’s
per
se
complaints,
page
22
is
his
amended
complaint
in
burrell,
page
43
and
137
are
the
opening
statements
by
council
at
the
evidential
hearings
and
both
of
those
cases
and
all
that
indicates
clearly
that
the
only
request
being
made
by
mccray
in
those
cases
was
for
damages.
i
believe
when
his
original
per
se
complaint
was
filed
in
one
of
the
cases,
he
requested
injunctive
relief
because
at
that
time
he
was
being
subjected
to
the
conditions
he
was
complaining
about,
but
by
the
time
the
case
came
to
trial
it
was
quite
evident
that
the
only
issues
before
the
district
court
had
to
do
with
damages.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
the
records
reflects
that
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
of
what
the
number
was.
i
think
the
attorney
general
said
37
and
that
maybe
i
can.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
i
believe
some
of
them
were
in
the
state
court
system
as
well.
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
that
is
reflected
somewhere
in
the
record
in
chief
judge
norton's
opinion.
i
do
not
have
the
figure,
but
it
is
high.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
am
not
sure
about
that
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
as
the
state
concedes
the
maryland
inmate
grievance
commission
does
not
have
the
authority
to
award
either
compensatory
or
punitive
money
damages
and
when
an
administrative
agency
is
not
empowered
to
grant
relief,
effective
relief
or
as
in
this
case
any
relief,
it
must
be
deemed
to
be
inadequate
remedy
and
exhaustion
should
not
be
required.
in
addition,
in
both
of
mccray’s
cases
the
district
court
held
evidentiary
hearings
and
ruled
on
the
merits.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court
and
also
reached
the
merits
remanding
the
cases
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
whether
burrell
and
smith
may
avail
themselves
for
qualified
immunity
and
good
faith
defense.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
where,
are
the
commission
under
the
statute
has
no
enforcement
authority
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
no,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
that
they
can
do
is
make
a
recommendation
to
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
public
safety
and
correctional
services
who
would
then
enforce
the
recommendation,
if
he
saw
proper
to
do
something.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well
he
has
the
authority
under
the
statute
to
review
all.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
there
is
no
compulsion.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
no,
your
honor,
not
the
commission
directly.
it
only
makes
a
recommendation
to
the
secretary.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
to
the
prison
system?
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
the
record
that
reflects
that
one
way
or
another.
there
were
some
testimony
taken
that
in
one
particular
case
where
in
fact
mccray
had
gotten
relief
from
the
grievance
commission
which
had
been
affirmed
by
the
secretary
on
the
question
of
whether
he
should
be
present
when
his
cell
was
searched.
the
evidence
indicated
at
the
hearing
that
directive
of
the
commission
had
never
been
enforced
by
the
maryland
penitentiary
and
that
the
excuse
that
they
used
was
it
they
had
shortage
of
manpower.
that
is
the
only
example
that
i
know
of
in
the
record.
no
purpose
would
be
served
in
as
much
as
mccray’s
case
have
already
been
ruled
on
the
merits
in
having
him
go
back
to
the
state
administrative
remedy
at
this
late
stage
in
his
cases.
the
john
washington’s
case
against
officials
of
maryland’s
patuxent
institution
for
denial
of
medical
treatment
is
also
a
claim
for
damages.
he
requested
declaratory
relief
in
his
per
se
complaint,
but
the
declaratory
relief
was
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
achieve
an
award
of
damages
on
the
declaration.
the
inmate
grievance
commission
again
cannot
provide
the
relief
requested
to
washington
because
it
has
no
power
to
award
damages,
and
therefore,
it
again
is
an
inadequate
administrative
remedy
in
his
case.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
yes
sir.
i
think
that
was
implicit
in
preiser
and
perhaps
even
discussed
there,
but
the
circumstances
are
quite
different
here
where
is
no
request
for
equitable
relief
being
made
in
any
of
these
cases.
the
only
request
for
relief
is
for
damages.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
grievance
commission
cannot
award
the
relief
to
washington
that
he
wants,
washington
was
released
from
confinement
from
patuxent
in
19
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
it
would
require
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
that
would
be
required
in
the
district
court,
yes
sir.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
mccray
cannot
be
awarded
the
relief
he
seeks
by
the
grievance
commission.
he
is
been
released
from
patuxent
and
by
the
terms
of
the
grievance
commission
statute,
he
can
no
longer
file
a
complaint
with
the
grievance
commission.
so
we
would
suggest
that
the
issue
of
exhaustion
in
mccray’s
case
is
moot
or
in
washington’s
case
is
moot
at
this
time.
the
fourth
case
before
the
court
that
of
james
e.
stokes
against
official’s
of
the
maryland’s
penitentiary,
alleging
that
the
institution's
procedures
and
standards
for
censorship
of
literature,
prisoners
may
read
and
receive
are
unconstitutional,
should
also
be
decided
by
the
court
on
narrow
grounds.
in
his
per
se
complaint
stokes
sought
damages
and
injunctive
relief.
for
purposes
of
his
damage
claim,
again,
the
inmate
grievance
commission
is
an
inadequate
state
remedy
and
as
we
indicated
in
the
supplemental
brief
which
respondents
filed
because
of
two
recent
judicial
decisions
which
directly
affect
stokes,
he
no
longer
finds
it
necessary
to
pursue
his
claim
for
equitable
relief
when
his
case
returns
to
the
district
court.
stokes
is
authorized
thus
to
state
here
today,
that
he
will
he
only
request
damages
when
his
case
again
reaches
the
district
court.
he
has
been
transferred
from
the
maryland
penitentiary
to
patuxent
institution
where
he
is
now
committed
as
a
defective
delinquent
for
an
indeterminate
sentence
under
an
order
by
a
judge
of
the
baltimore
city
circuit
court.
although
that
decision
has
been
appealed
by
the
state,
stokes
has
no
present
interest
which
is
effective
by
the
maryland
penitentiary
censorship
regulations.
in
addition,
the
identical
constitutional
claim
made
by
stokes
to
the
regulations
at
the
penitentiary
has
been
decided
by
district
court
judge
kaufman
in
another
case
filed
by
another
penitentiary
prisoner.
whatever
the
outcome
of
the
state's
appeal
in
that
case,
stokes'
equitable
claim
will
be
resolved
there.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
your
honor,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
decision
in
the
hopkins
case
which
is
the
case
i
was
referring
to
will
necessary
rule
in
stokes'
favor,
but
it
will
resolve
stokes'
issue
one
way
or
another.
the
issue
is
identical,
your
honor.
stokes
is
claiming
that
the
standards
for
censorship
of
literature
to
penitentiary
and
also
the
due
process
safeguards
in
connection
with
the
censorship
decision
making
were
inadequate
and
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
he
will
be
bound
by
that
except
with
regard
in
his
damage
claim
which
applies
only
to
his
specific
instance
of
being
denied
specific
literature
several
years
ago.
for
all
of
these
reasons
under
the
facts
of
the
cases
before
the
court,
maryland
does
not
provide
an
adequate
administrative
remedy
for
these
plaintiffs.
there
is
another
reason
why
the
court
should
not
decide
the
broad
question
of
policy
raised
by
the
state.
if
section
1983
is
to
be
amended
by
adding
an
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
remedies
requirement,
that
amendment
should
be
made
by
legislation
and
not
by
judicial
decree.
the
state
in
asking
the
court
to
resume
the
–
the
state
is
asking
the
court
to
assume
the
role
of
congress.
in
fact,
the
state's
on
argument
leaves
inescapably
to
the
conclusion
that
any
fundamental
change
in
the
scope
of
1983
should
be
made
by
congress.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
your
honor
that
was
exactly
the
point
i
was
about
to
develop
if
i
can
carry
through
with
it.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
why
is
congress
--?
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
yes,
your
honor.
the
position
that
we
take
with
regard
to
that
is
that
in
monroe
versus
pape,
this
court
interpreted
congressional
intent
behind
section
what
was
then
1979
which
is
now
section
1983,
that
congressional
intent
was
stated
in
monroe
v.
pape
in
has
been
stated
by
the
court
in
decision
subsequent
to
that.
the
congressional
intent
was
that
the
state
remedy
be
supplement
--
that
the
federal
remedy
be
supplementary
to
the
state
remedy
and
that
the
state
remedy
need
not
be
first
exhausted
before
the
federal
remedy
may
be
invoked.
now,
what
the
state
is
suggesting
in
this
case
is
that
this
court
reinterpret
the
intent
of
section
1983.
there
is
no
further
evidence
before
the
court
that
the
interpretation
of
legislative
intent
in
monroe
versus
pape
was
incorrect.
the
state's
position
is
that
because
maryland
has
inadequate
inmate
grievance
commission
that
now
the
court
free
to
disregard
the
intent
that
was
expressed
in
monroe
versus
pape
and
to
create
an
exhaustion
requirement.
now,
our
position
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
more
directly
answering
your
question.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
court
has
no
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
this
would
be
an
improper
role
for
the
court
to
take.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
an
improper
role
for
the
court
to
take,
particularly
with
regard
to
prisoner
grievance
mechanism
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
express
if
i
may.
what
the
substance
and
i
think
this
goes
more
directly
to
your
question,
your
honor,
what
the
substance
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
is,
is
that
because
times
are
now
different
than
they
where
in
1871.
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
rule
for
1983
is
now
appropriate.
it
should
--
this
argument,
however,
should
made
to
congress
and
not
to
the
court
and
the
reason
is
that
if
times
have
changed
as
the
state
argues
it
is
congress
which
should
reevaluate
the
policies
underlying
its
1871
determination
that
their
should
be
no
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
in
1983.
for
example
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
your
honor,
i
think
that
comes
from
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
from
this
court
beginning
with
monroe
versus
pape
in
extending
through
damaco
in
bicknese
(ph)
and
district
of
columbia
versus
carter
and
all
the
cases
that
i
have
cited.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
we
assert
that
the
question
of
what
legislative
intent
was
behind
1871,
is
no
longer
open.
that,
that
question
has
been
decided
by
this
court
in
monroe
versus
pape
and
reaffirmed
over
and
over
in
the
other
decisions.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
that
is
true,
only
judicial
remedies
in
that
case,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
no
sir,
but
past
monroe
versus
pape
there
was
a
serious
of
decisions
that
decided
that
the
intent
of
the
1871
act
applied
not
only
to
judicial,
but
also
to
administrative
remedies
and
also
that
it
applied
to
remedies
which
where
available
inadequate
that
the
fact
of
adequate
available
remedies
made
no
difference
in
what
the
congressional
intent
was
and
having
established
that
as
the
congressional
intent,
it
would
be
improper
for
in
the
absence
of
some
evidence
that
there
was
different
congressional
intent
before
anyone,
besides
congress
to
reevaluate
the
policies
that
underly
section
1871
act.
we
would
suggest
that
this
was
a
particularly
inappropriate
time
for
the
court
to
act
on
this
because
at
this
very
moment
there
are
two
bills
pending
before
congress.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
your
honor
i
think
it
is
really
the
proper
term
is
inappropriate.
i
think
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
under
the
circumstances
that
of
what
the
state
is
arguing
in
this
case
that
this
court
should
give
proper
deference
to
the
role
of
congress
in
amending
section
1983.
as
an
example,
i
think
the
way
in
which
the
court
handled
preiser
versus
rodriguez,
where
the
court
gave
specific
deference
to
explicit
congressional
intent
in
a
habeas
corpus
statute
and
thereby
carved
out
an
exception
to
section
1983.
there
was
no
exhaustion
requirement
attached
to
1983
because
of
explicit
congressional
intent
that
there
should
be
certain
cases
which
cannot
be
brought
under
1983.
and
then
under
those
circumstances,
there
should
be
exhaustion
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
what
we
arguing.
that
there
should
be
--
that
proper
difference
given
to
what
the
congress
intended,
especially
in
this
case
where
the
court
has
already
found
what
congress
intended
in
monroe
and
all
the
cases
that
followed.
as
i
was
mentioning,
there
are
two
bills
presently
pending
before
congress,
congressman
railsback
has
introduced
hr
12008
and
congressman
rodino
has
introduced
hr
12230
and
both
of
these
bills
are
now
pending
before
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary.
if
the
bills
are
enacted
they
would
amend
section
1983
to
impose
an
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
remedies
requirement
for
state
prisoners.
in
addition
to
the
broader
policy
question
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
myes
sir.
they
are
both
before
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
a
one
by
mr.
rodino
and
one
by
mr.
railsback.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
do
not
know
sir.
i
do
not
believe
so
and
i
believe
there
is
also
another
bill
that
is
been
introduced
by
a
congressman
kastenmeier
which
does
not
specifically
speak
to
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
but
i
believe
has
provisions
in
it
which
deal
with
the
problem
that
the
district
courts
have
in
handling
prisoner
complaints.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
can
speak
to
the
railsback
bill
specifically.
that
specifically
is
directed
to
prisoners
and
i
believe
rodino’s
bill
is
also
specifically
directed
to
prisoners.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
am
sorry
sir,
do
you
mean
the
rationale
for
exhaustion
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
think
what
the
state
is
saying
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
because
the
state
of
maryland
has
developed
what
they
say
is
an
adequate
state
administrative
remedy
that
this
court
should
then
require
state
prisoners
to
exhaust
that
remedy.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
think
that
in
the
way
in
which
the
inmate
grievance
commission
is
setup
definitely
it
is
far
from
any
guarantee
that
the
inmate
grievance
commission
is
going
to
be
adequately
able
to
solve
constitutional
questions.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
i
think
at
most
what
the
grievance
commission
could
do,
would
be
to
declare
that
a
prison
regulation
is
no
longer
meet
sound
correctional
standards,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
qualified
to
declare
something
unconstitutional.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
primary
policies
that
underly
an
exhaustion
requirement
in
any
circumstances
in
a
sense
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
it
would
seem
to
me
your
honor
that
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
fundamental
purposes
of
exhaustion
should
be
to
create
a
record
for
the
district
court
and
also
to
allow
the
agency
an
opportunity
to
correct
its
own
errors.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
and
i
think
that
those
two
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
no
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
no
sir,
we
have
suggested
just
the
opposite
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
yes
sir.
what
i
was
leading
to
was,
in
the
habeas
corpus
situation
for
example,
where
congress
has
enacted
specific
statute
and
says
specifically
how
the
district
court
may
use
the
state
court
proceedings.
now,
there
was
no
such
statute
in
existence
now
as
to
how
the
district
court
can
use
state
administrative
remedies
proceedings.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
we
take
the
position
under
the
grievance
commission
statute
as
it
presently
exists
without
enabling
legislation
from
congress,
the
district
court
simply
cannot
use
the
record
of
the
administrative
agency
proceeding
as
anymore
than
a
matter
of
interest
to
read
the
facts
of
what
perhaps
happened,
but
as
far
using
it
in
the
decision
making
process,
we
would
say
that
would
be
inappropriate
in
the
absence
of
the
legislation
and
more
particularly
we
believe
that
legislation
is
particularly
--
that
kind
of
a
requirement
should
not
be
imposed
without
legislation
because
really
it
is
only
congress
who
is
able
to
evaluate
all
the
interests
that
are
involved.
the
state's
interest,
the
court's
interest
and
the
prisoner’s
interest
in
setting
up
what
would
be
an
effective
remedy
that
would
serve
the
purposes
of
allowing
the
agency
to
correct
its
own
errors
and
also
serve
the
purposes
of
the
district
court
and
no
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
have
not
seen
that
report,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
well,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
james
bennett
is
a
member
of
the
commission
in
maryland
and
i
think
his
dissenting
opinion
is
particularly
relevant
to
the
situation
before
the
court
because
in
that
opinion
he
describes
the
really
chaotic
decision
making
and
fact
finding
process
of
the
inmate
grievance
commission
and
certainly
that
kind
of
the
a
remedy
is
not
the
kind
of
a
remedy
that
would
serve
any
valuable
purpose
to
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
think
it
was
1971
legislation
that
set
up
the
commission
and
i
think
they
began
to
function
about
a
year
later
or
less.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
in
our
supplemental
brief,
i
think
that
we
brought
those
statistics
up
to
date,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
think
that
they
are
referred
to
--
certainly
that
the
record
of
the
case
at
the
time
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
court
contained
that
information
and
i
think
it
is
been
updated
through
our
supplemental
brief
and
also
through
some
of
the
materials
filed
by
the
state
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
no,
your
honor.
i
have
not
heard
that
mr.
--
the
attorney
general
today
stated
the
figure
which
i
have
not
heard
before
and
i
--
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
do
not
believe
that
figure
is
in
the
record
and
i
have
not
heard
it
from
any
other
source.
i
do
know
that
as
far
as
the
most
recent
performance
of
the
grievance
commission
in
the
supplemental
brief
that
we
filed,
we
indicated
recent
statistics
that
indicate
in
only
one
out
of
a
hundred
cases
of
prisoner
complaints
does
the
grievance
commission
grant
relief.
now
that
relief
is
granted
after
a
hearing
and
after
final
review
by
the
secretary,
that
is
during
the
past
four
months
period.
earlier
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
record
for
the
case
and
it
is
on
page
80
of
our
brief,
the
attorney
general
made
reference
to
the
allegation
that
the
grievance
commission
informally
resolves
many
of
the
complaints
that
come
before
them,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
need
for
a
hearing.
however,
in
discovery
in
this
case
we
asked
the
executive
director
about
specific
cases
over
i
believe
a
90-day
period
which
he
described
is
a
typical
day,
a
typical
period
of
time
for
the
commission
and
during
that
period
of
time
there
were
45
complaints
administratively
dismissed
and
only
four
of
those
were
complaints
they
were
informally
resolved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
inmate.
so
we
would
suggest
that
of
that
55%
or
65%
of
the
cases
which
are
administratively
dismissed
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
those,
perhaps
10%
or
less
are
actually
resolved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
prisoner.
that
when
added
to
the
fact
that
only
1%
of
those
which
ultimately
go
to
a
hearing
indicates
a
very,
very
low
number
of
cases.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
your
honor,
that
term
was
used
by
the
executive
director
in
his
deposition
and
i
think
again
that
indicates
a
difficulty
in
trying
to
impose
an
exhaustion
requirement
to
1983
because
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
it
means
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
inmate.
it
does
not
mean
that
he
will
no
longer
to
pursue
his
claim
into
court.
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
to
a
satisfaction
within
the
confines
of
grievance
commission's
jurisdiction
which
means
that
he
will
go
on
for
damages
or
what.
it
is
really
extremely
difficult
to
say
what
the
state
means
by
the
grievance
commission
having
responded
satisfactorily
to
an
inmate.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
no
sir,
i
do
not
know
what
the
statistics
are
on
that?
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
i
imagine
that
it
is
low,
your
honor
and
i
was
not
suggesting
the
figure
to
show
that
a
lot
of
prisoner
complaints
are
meritorious
and
the
grievance
commission
is
turning
them
down.
i
brought
that
figure
to
the
attention
of
the
court
to
indicate
that
giving
the
agency
in
opportunity
to
correct
its
own
action
is
not
what
the
grievance
commission
is
doing.
it
is
only
correcting
its
own
action
and
one
out
of
a
hundred
cases.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
perhaps,
yes
sir.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
direct
just
the
last
few
minutes
that
i
have
in
the
case
to
the
merits
of
mccray’s
claims.
the
facts
of
these
cases
are
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
basically
the
important
facts
are
that
mccray
was
thrown
--
placed
into
isolated
confinement
on
two
separate
occasions.
the
conditions
of
isolated
confinement
in
one
case,
the
burrell
case
were
particularly
severe
and
more
so
than
in
the
smith
case.
in
that
situation
he
was
placed
in
a
small
cell
naked
without
any
bedding,
without
any
mattress,
the
cell
was
cold,
there
was
no
toilet
in
the
cell,
he
was
denied
all
elements
of
personal
hygiene
for
two-day
period.
he
was
even
denied
toilet
paper
during
that
period
of
time.
his
toilet
was
at
6
to
8
inch
in
diameter
hole
in
one
corner
of
the
cell
with
an
iron
grating
over
which
was
encrusted
with
the
excrement
of
prisoners
who
would
been
in
that
cell
before
him.
he
remained
there
for
two
days
without
ever
receiving
any
kind
of
counseling,
medical
attention
or
professional
help
from
a
psychiatrist
or
a
psychologist.
and
the
basis
of
our
argument
is
that
although
there
was
perhaps
reason
to
have
placed
mccray
into
an
isolated
confinement
situation
because
he
needed
to
be
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
population
to
avoid
creating
a
disturbance
and
for
his
own
protection,
our
claim
is
that
the
conditions
of
isolated
confinement
and
the
length
of
isolated
confinement
from
mccray
were
arbitrary
under
the
circumstances
and
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
directive
--
the
regulation
of
the
maryland
prison
system
provided
a
liberty
interest
that
mccray
had
in
not
being
thrown
into
isolated
confinement
for
arbitrary
reasons.
in
addition
to
that
wolf
versus
mcdonald
seems
to
establish
that
some
minimal
form
of
due
process
is
available
to
a
prisoner
before
going
into
solitary
confinement.
under
these
circumstances,
we
say
that
that
mccray
was
not
entitled
to
a
wolf
versus
mcdonald
hearing,
but
what
we
do
say
is
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
minimum
of
procedure
in
order
to
assure
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
and
the
length
of
the
confinement
were
necessary
and
we
say
that
the
rule
of
reasonableness
in
this
case
is
maryland
penitentiary's
own
administrative
director.
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
proper
deference
to
maryland
prison
officials
by
suggesting
that
that
was
the
minimum
constitutional
standards.
in
answer
to
the
question
posed
earlier
by,
your
honor,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
mere
violation
of
a
state
regulation
arises
--
raises
a
constitutional
claim
in
this
case.
we
are
saying
that
first
of
all
the
regulation
serves
two
purposes
in
the
case.
first
of
all,
it
establishes
a
liberty
interest
on
the
part
of
mccray,
an
interest
that
cannot
be
deprived
without
some
kind
of
a
minimal
procedure
to
assure
that
it
is
not
arbitrarily
deprived
and
second
the
regulation
provides
a
standard
for
what
is
minimally
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
that
certainly
is
our
position,
your
honor
and
in
the
brief
we
cite
to
a
number
of
other
state
and
federal
prison
regulations
which
are
similar
or
even
more
restrictive
of
prison
officials,
certainly
what
maryland
has
imposed
on
its
own
prison
officials
is
the
bare
minimum
under
these
circumstances,
mccray
did
not
get
it.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
yes
sir,
we
take
the
position
of
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
is
not
the
controlling
factor.
the
controlling
factor
is
the
policy
argument
which
underlies
section
1983.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
we
believe
that,
that
kind
of
an
exhaustion
requirement
cannot
at
this
point
be
grafted
onto
the
civil
rights
act
without
congressional
amendment.
mr.
charles
f.
morgan
yes
sir,
we
do
and
the
only
reason
i
did
not
direct
myself
to
it
is
because
the
red
light
was
on.
i
will
be
glad
to
do
so.
thank
you.
