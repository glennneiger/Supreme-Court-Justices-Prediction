justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
come
back
to
the
adequacy
of
the
administrative
remedy.
most
of
these
prison
cases,
at
least
most
of
the
ones
i
have
seen,
claim
damages.
they
may
also
request
injunctive
or
the
declaratory
relief.
what
does
this
board,
this
commission
that
you
have
described,
do
with
a
damage
claim?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
does
it
make
any
finding
with
respect
to
the
entitlement
to
damage?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
there
any
decisions
of
a
federal
district
court
in
baltimore
that
indicate
whether
that
record
is
admissible
in
evidence?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
thought
he
said
55,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
but
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
morgan.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
do
you
say
that
only
congress
could
make
some
interpretation
of
section
1983?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
do
you
say
that
we
lack
power
to
reinterpret
if
we
decided
to
do
it,
1983
prior
to
1963
in
monroe
against
pape.
this
was
certainly
an
unsettled
issue
at
best?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)mr.
morgan.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
may
i
interrupt
you
because
it
might
show
in
your
answer.
i
can
understand
how
you
could
argue
with
some
force
that
there
are
precedents
of
this
court
that
should
not
be
reconsidered,
but
you
are
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
we
have
no
authority
to
reconsider
them?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
are
you
arguing
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
an
improper?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
did
the
commission
commenced
the
function?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
record
show
how
many
cases
that
the
commission
has
processed
to
final
decision?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
recall
generally
what
they
are?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
indication
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
final
decisions
of
the
commission
in
fact
are
taken
into
the
federal
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
heard
him
state
that
