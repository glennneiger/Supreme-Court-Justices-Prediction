justice
john
paul
stevens
general
burch,
what
would
the
maryland
commission
have
done
in
this
case
if
the
allegations
of
the
petition
were
true?
what
remedy
would
have
been
the
appropriate
remedy
that
the
commission
could
have
given?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
allegations
were
true,
they
were
not
following
rules
which
are
already
in
effect,
is
that
not
correct?
does
he
not
allege
that
there
was
a
rule
that
of
required
immediate
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
thought
he
had
alleged
that
there
was
a
violation
by
the
prison
officials
of
the
prison's
own
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
on
that
very
question,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disagree
with
the
findings
of
fact,
but
rather
drew
different
inferences
for
those
findings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
48
hours
without
clothing
in
a
cell,
without
heat
and
so
forth
was
cruel
and
unusual?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
will
not
be
bound
on
that
kind
of
question
by
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
not
like
setting
aside
of
finding
of
fact
as
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morgan
do
those
bills
merely
provide
for
exhaustion
in
prisoner
cases
or
in
cases
generally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morgan,
do
you
know
if
those
statistics
are
very
different
from
the
percentage
of
cases
that
resolve
satisfactorily
to
the
inmate
that
are
filed
in
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
clearly
low
percentage
there
are
to,
i
believe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
morgan
you
also
rely
on
the
eighth
amendment
in
your
constitutional
claim?
