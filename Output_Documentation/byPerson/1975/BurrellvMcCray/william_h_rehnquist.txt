justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
general,
i
think
there
is
a
statement
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
effect
that
a
state
is
required
to
follow
its
own
procedural
rules
and
of
course
that
is
certainly
true
in
the
federal
government.
do
you
agree
that,
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement
as
to
the
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
it
is
not
a
constitutional
right
then
presumably
the
federal
court
has
no
business
imposing
it
on
a
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
would
say,
well,
stay
there
till
the
federal
courts
get
through
it
and
approve
it
in
appropriate
cases
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
morgan
did
we
not
have
that
sort
of
bifurcation
in
preiser
to
where
it
was
clear
that
damage
ream
or
the
damage
claim
of
a
prisoner
could
be
retained
on
the
docket
of
the
district
court,
but
that
his
claim
for
other
relief
might
have
to
go
through
state
exhaustion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
on
the
state's
appeal
that
was
reversed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
rules
on
it,
it
will
either
does
--
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
appellant
there
will
be
unfavorable
to
your
client,
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
appellee
will
be
favorable
to
him
and
he
will
be
bound
and
either
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
saying
that
same
congress
made
a
determination
in
1871
that
there
should
be
no
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy?
i
mean,
does
that
come
from
legislative
history?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
argue
on
two
different
grounds
here
and
if
it
strikes
may
that
perhaps,
at
least
i
do
not
understand
it
to
being
firmly
committed
to
one
or
the
other
or
to
perhaps
both.
you
can
say
that
regardless
of
what
the
prior
cases
of
the
court
have
said
even
if
we
are
writing
on
clean
slate,
you
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
and
its
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
administrative
remedy
be
exhausted
or
you
can
say
that
even
though
there
might
be
doubt
as
to
legislative
history
the
precedents
of
the
courts
say
that
administrative
remedy
should
not
be
exhausted.
now,
do
you
assert
both
those
grounds
or
if
not,
which
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
in
monroe
versus
pape
where
the
court
was
confronted
only
with
judicial
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
are
not
bound
by
dicta,
are
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
assume
you
can
argue
too
since
the
state
has
been
willing
to
adopt
it,
it
does
not
unreasonably
frustrate
the
goals
of
prison
administration?
