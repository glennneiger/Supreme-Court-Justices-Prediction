mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cases
here
today
are
consolidated,
three
cases
dealing
with
three
inmates
of
the
maryland
state
penitentiary.
one
is
mccray,
one
is
mr.
stokes,
the
other
is
mr.
washington.
we
will
give
a
few
facts
with
respect
to
mr.
mccray
since
that
was
the
only
case
that
was
decided
on
its
merits
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
only
common
issue
with
respect
to
mr.
stokes
and
washington
is
the
single
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
remedies
is
required.
mccray
is
now
confined
in
the
maryland
penitentiary,
serving
28
years
for
having
--
been
guilty
of
four
counts
of
assault
with
intent
to
murder.
during
the
first
four
years
of
his
confinement,
he
filed
37
civil
rights
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
baltimore.
thereafter,
he
filed
additional
civil
rights
actions
so
there
are
now
55
actions
that
have
been
filed
by
mr.
mccray.
8
of
which
deal
with
habeas
corpus
relief
and
the
balance
of
which
deal
the
civil
rights
relief.
until
the
circuit
court
in
this
case,
which
we
say
wrongly,
gave
some
remedy
to
mr.
mccray,
not
anyone
of
his
petitions
gave
him
any
relief
whatsoever.
judge
field
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
his
dissent
described
mccray
from
his
litigious
history
as
a
chronic
trouble
maker
and
malcontent
who
was
engaged
in
a
ceaseless
array
of
frivolous
civil
suits
at
public
expense
based
upon
allegations
that
have
already
been
repeatedly
found
worthless
and
i
would
say
that
as
of
today
the
civil
actions
that
have
been
filed
by
mr.
mccray
have
caused
the
state
of
maryland
something
in
excess
of
$350,000.
mccray
alleges
deprivation
of
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
in
1971
in
two
separate
occurrences,
a
month
apart,
alleging
improper
punishment,
illegal
conditions
of
confinement
and
denial
of
medical
care.
the
fourth
circuit
declared
that
the
condition
of
mccray’s
two
days
solitary
confinement,
resulting
from
his
disturbance
and
misconduct,
violated
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
penitential,
maryland
state
penitentiary,
in
baltimore
city,
yes.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
i
do
not
really
do
not
know
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
have
not
been
down
there
so
i
am
not
sure
exactly
where
it
is.
mr.
stutman?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
is
the
south
wing
segregation
division
which
i
understand
is
not
underground,
is
that
correct?
it
is
not
underground.
the
fourth
circuit
remanded
the
issue
on
monetary
damages
and
the
qualified
immunities
of
the
prison
guards
to
the
district
court
for
further
determination.
but
in
our
view
it
is
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
mccray
case,
and
therefore,
we
will
not
deal
further
with
the
facts.
we
submit
that
the
district
court
of
maryland
was
correct
in
its
threshold
determination
that
the
widely
recognized
principles
of
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
remedies
required
the
respondents
in
these
cases
to
present
their
complaints
concerning
the
conditions
and
circumstances
of
their
confinement,
first
to
the
maryland
grievance
commission
before
approaching
the
federal
courts.
the
maryland
inmate
grievance
commission
procedure
is
an
adequate
and
an
effective
state
administrative
remedy
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
do
not,
in
our
view,
hold
that
where
there
is
an
adequate
administrative
remedy,
a
litigant
may
seek
relief
in
the
federal
courts
without
first
exhausting
that
administrative
remedy.
we
believe
that
this
view
is
implicit
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
comments
in
bicknese.
in
that
particular
case,
he
stated,
moreover
it
is
by
no
means
clear
that
illinois
law
provides
petitioners
with
an
administrative
remedy
sufficiently
adequate
to
preclude
prior
resort
to
a
federal
court
for
protection
of
their
federal
rights.
and
i
might
say
that
this
particular
quote
immediately
followed
the
citation
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
lane
versus
wilson
in
307
u.s.
we
believe
that
lane
versus
wilson,
the
predecessor
of
the
monroe,
specifically
held
by
implication,
if
not
by
direct
holding,
that
where
there
was
an
effective
state
administrative
remedy
that
this
must
be
exhausted
before
a
1983
suit,
maybe
unattained
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
the
allegations
were
true,
the
commission
could
have
changed
the
system
with
respect
to,
they
could
have
taken
disciplinary
actions
against
the
guards
who
were
involved
in
question.
they
could
have
notified
the
superintendent
of
the
institution
that
the
procedures
would
have
to
be
changed
and
they
would
notify
him
that
in
this
particular
case
there
was
a
question
of
the
two
days
solitary
confinement
without
the
person
--
that
mr.
mccray
being
clothed.
this
was
done
for
his
own
protection,
but
if
the
administrative
grievance
commission
were
to
have
made
the
determination
that
this
was
improper,
they
could
have
issued
directions
which
would
be
binding
upon
the
agency
to
correct
that
condition.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
was
difficult
to
state
exactly
what
mr.
mccray
alleged
because
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
were
prepared
by
him
in
his
own
hand
and
they
are
not
particularly
articulate.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
it
may
well
be
that
he
could
have
claimed
that
there
were
violations
of
the
prison's
own
rules,
but
at
least
the
grievance
commission
as
approved
by
the
action
of
the
secretary
would
have
been
able
then
to
take
remedial
action
within
the
institution
itself.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
to
see
that
it
did
not
occur
again
and
that
would
be
the
nature
of
the
relief
that
was
requested
which
was
both
declaratory
and
injunctive.
there
was
a
request
for
monetary
damages.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
necessarily
a
constitutional
requirement,
unless
it
involves
a
constitutional
right,
but
certainly
it
would
be
the
most
desirable
thing
that
a
state
be
required
to
follow
its
own
rules
or
an
institution
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
certainly
would
not
have
the
right
to
impose
that
burden
on
the
state
unless
it
involved
the
impingement
of
a
constitutional
right,
it
would
seem
to
me.
i
might
say
also
that
mr.
justice
harlan
in
damaco
read
the
majority
opinion
at
least
to
hold
that
is
a
requirement
of
exhaustion
that
the
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
an
adequate
state
remedy
was
condemned
in
monroe.
in
the
90
years
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
the
90
years
that
passed
between
then
and
the
holding
in
monroe,
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
assumed
it
with
good
reason
that
exhaustion
principles
applied
in
1983
action
where
there
was
an
adequate
administrative
state
remedy.
furthermore
as
early
as
1886,
this
court
ex
parte
royale
decided
that
a
state
prisoner
seeking
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
under
what
is
now
section
2254,
could
first
be
required
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
apply
to
the
state
court
for
such
relief.
this
specific
mandatory
requirement
by
the
way
was
not
written
into
section
2254
by
the
congress
until
1948,
some
62
years
later.
and
certainly
what
was
true
under
royale
as
to
the
predecessor
of
section
2254,
should
be
equally
be
as
applicable
in
1983
cases.
next
to
life
itself,
the
most
cherish
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
is
that
of
a
person’s
right
to
his
freedom.
this
court
has
held
in
legions
of
cases
that
property
and
other
rights
are
insignificant
in
comparison
to
one's
right
to
his
liberty.
if
this
be
the
case
then
by
what
possible
logic
can
it
be
said
that
state
administrative
remedies
need
be
exhausted
before
one
can
evoke
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
seek
relief
from
alleged
illegal
incarceration,
while
those
same
remedies
need
not
be
exhausted
with
respect
to
alleged
conditions
of
confinement
such
as
food,
privileges,
censorship
etcetera,
to
ask
the
question,
we
submit
is
to
answer
it
or
more
simply
stated
has
this
court
said
in
the
past
that
the
state
can
be
trusted
with
the
most
precious
of
all
person's
rights
his
liberty,
but
yet
cannot
be
trusted
with
this
property
rights
and
other
privileges.
we
certainly
think
this
is
not
the
case.
monroe
simply
held
that
the
right
to
litigate
in
the
state
courts
could
not
deprive
a
citizen
of
his
right
to
immediate
recourse
to
the
federal
courts.
but
in
so
holding,
this
court
specifically
noted,
that
one
of
the
three
main
purposes
of
1983
was
to
provide
a
federal
remedy
whether
state
remedy
though
adequate
in
theory,
was
not
available
in
practice.
as
this
court
knows
the
doctrine
of
monroe
was
extended
two
years
later
in
bicknese
a
school
system
case
to
a
questionable
administrative
remedy
as
contrasted
with
the
judicial
remedy
in
monroe.
in
bicknese,
justice
douglas,
suggested
for
the
first
time
that
the
court's
supplementary
language
in
monroe
actually
represented
a
fourth
purpose,
but
as
judge
noel
in
anger
egnar
versus
texas
city
said
to
read
the
court's
supplementary
language
as
creating
a
fourth
and
virtually
unlimited
occasion
for
the
application
of
the
section
1983
would
render
superfluous
monroe’s
extensive
previous
discussion
of
the
second
and
the
third
statutory
purposes.
then
8
years
after
bicknese
in
a
majority
per
curiam
opinion
in
willwording,
a
statement
appears
and
i
might
say
without
more
that
an
inmate
need
not
first
seek
questionably
available
administrative
remedies.
we
submit,
however,
that
as
the
dissenters
did
in
the
fourth
circuit,
this
loose
statement
from
the
per
curiam
willwording
holding
is
based
upon
a
faulty
reading
of
the
predecessor
cases
and
should
not
and
does
not
represent
the
state
of
the
existing
law.
moreover
the
unanimous
views
of
all
7
of
the
circuit
court
judges
below
reflected
a
deep
disenchantment
with
a
non-exhaustion
rule
followed
and
applied
only
because
they
said
we
had
no
alternative
and
the
exhortation
that
this
court
reexamine
and
modify
its
earlier
decisions.
we
would
hope
that
reexamination
will
result
in
a
clarification
of
the
per
curiam
willwording
holding
in
favor
of
a
narrower
and
more
accurate
reading
of
the
sixth-three
majority
opinion
in
monroe.
such
a
clarification
we
submit
is
similar
to
the
one
undertaken
by
this
court
in
1973,
in
miller
versus
california.
there
it
was
stated
that
the
ross
test
of
obscenity
had
been
drastically
altered
in
1966
by
the
plurality
opinion
in
memoirs
versus
massachusetts
so
as
to
require
prosecutors
to
prove
a
negative
that
the
material
is
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
following
this
court's
opinion
in
memoirs,
a
multitude
a
per
curiam
opinions
breathed
life
into
the
orderly
without
redeeming
social
value
test
and
thereby
seem
to
establish
that
as
a
basic
test
which
was
there
that
--
as
a
basic
test
which
was
there
to
consider
controlling
in
numerous
lower
court
decisions
under
the
doctrine
which
we
call
creeping
stare
decisis.
the
miller
decision,
however,
finally
returned
the
case
law
in
this
area
to
its
proper
and
established
path.
as
this
court
was
sure
enough
of
its
questionable
role
as
a
super
sensor
and
as
the
lower
courts
were
sure
enough
of
their
roles
as
statures
by
the
reexamination
and
clarification
of
memoirs
by
millers.
so
also
would
this
court
only
be
shoring
up
the
role
of
super
warden
by
a
proper
clarification
of
monroe
and
its
progeny
in
this
case.
the
same
of
course
would
apply
to
the
role
of
the
lower
federal
courts
as
being
the
wardens
of
the
various
institutions
throughout
this
country.
the
nature
of
the
administrative
remedy
provided
by
the
legislature
of
maryland
makes
the
time
and
the
setting,
particularly
right
for
reanalyzing
and
restating
the
law
on
this
very
thorny
subject.
maryland’s
inmate
grievance
commission
presents
this
court
with
a
case
of
first
impression.
two
of
its
members
must
be
lawyers
and
two
of
its
members
must
be
experts
in
the
field
of
correction.
the
commission
is
headed
by
an
executive
director
who
has
a
significant
professional
experience
than
significant
professional
assistance.
only
those
grievances
or
complaints
which
are
wholly
lacking
in
merit
maybe
dismissed
without
a
hearing.
all
of
the
rest
must
be
the
subject
of
a
hearing
on
the
merits
with
a
full
penalty
of
due
process
rights.
the
commission
must
decide
the
matter
promptly
in
a
written
order,
containing
findings
of
fact,
delivered
to
the
secretary
who
must
affirm,
modify
or
reverse
within
15
days.
if
the
action
is
favorable
to
the
inmate,
the
secretary
is
directed
to
implement
the
order
and
to
take
whatever
action
he
deems
appropriate
in
light
of
the
commission’s
findings.
if
unfavorable,
judicial
review
is
immediately
available
to
the
inmate
in
the
state
courts
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
surely
it
cannot
be
said
that
maryland’s
remedy
is
an
adequate
solely
because
it
does
not
provide
for
money
damages
which
are
appropriate,
which
are
really
not
appropriate
or
available
in
the
vast
majority
of
1983
prisoner
suits.
meaningful
relief
in
practically
all
such
cases
is
achieved
by
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
that
is
determination
of
an
unconstitutional
prison
practices.
in
the
myriad
category
of
cases
where
monetary
damages
maybe
appropriate
and
available,
the
federal
court
could
simply
stay
its
hand
until
the
completion
of
the
administrative
proceeding,
thus,
gaining
the
benefit
of
the
record
there
made.
as
the
district
court
below
said
in
washington,
the
short
answer
to
this
is
that
since
the
commission
has
been
invested
with
powers
comparable
to
the
equity
power
of
a
federal
court,
the
prisoner
will
not
be
prejudiced
by
delaying
an
award
of
damages
until
the
grievous
procedures
had
been
exhausted.
respondents
have
raised
several
objections
to
the
adequacy
of
maryland’s
administrative
remedy.
they
say
that
54%
of
the
grievances
filed
are
dismissed
without
a
hearing
as
wholly
lacking
in
merit
and
that
in
only
11.4%
of
the
cases
is
the
grievance
found
to
be
meritorious.
first
of
all
we
would
note
that
938
or
55%
of
the
cases
disposed
of
were
disposed
of
administratively
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
inmate,
generally
through
the
offices
of
the
commission.
and
of
the
remaining
744
cases,
a
191
were
decided
in
favor
of
the
inmate.
this
represents
a
66%
favorable
disposition,
instead
of
the
11.4%
as
alleged
by
the
respondents.
we
will
also
note
that
the
federal
court
under
section
1915,
possesses
the
identical
authority
to
dismiss
wholly
frivolous
in
forma
pauperis
suits
and
respondents
own
statistics
establish
that
only
4.9%
of
federal
civil
right
suits
ever
reach
trial
and
is
not
unlikely
that
an
even
lower
percentage
are
ultimately
disposed
of
favorably
to
the
inmate.
finally,
respondents
complain
about
the
lapse
of
24
weeks
between
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
final
decision
thereon.
the
actual
time
today,
we
would
say,
is
94.9
days.
the
average
time
elapsing
between
the
date
of
the
filing
of
all
grievances
and
all
dispositions
is
only
40.6
days.
by
contrast,
the
elapsed
time
in
federal
court
between
the
filing
of
a
1983
prisoner
suit
and
its
ultimate
disposition
at
the
trial
table
is
we
understand
some
24
to
36
months.
to
comprehend
the
problem
that
maryland
has
sought
to
be
in
the
context
of
that
problem,
it
is
helpful
to
remember
the
language
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
preiser
(inaudible)
discussing
the
intimate
day
to
day
relationship
of
the
inmate
with
the
state
comity.
the
strong
considerations
of
comity
that
require
giving
a
state
court
system
that
has
convicted
a
defendant,
the
first
opportunity
to
correct
its
own
errors,
that
is
also
required
giving
the
states
the
first
opportunity
to
correct
the
errors
made
in
the
internal
administration
of
their
prisoners.
mr.
justice
powell
expressed
similar
concerns
in
procunier
and
mr.
justice
marshall
in
mccarthy
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
quote
from
his
language
in
that
case.
at
page
1663,
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
“certainly
very
practical
notions
of
judicial
efficiency
come
into
play
as
well.
a
complaining
party
maybe
successful
in
vindicating
his
rights
in
the
administrative
process.
if
he
has
required
to
pursue
his
administrative
remedies,
the
courts
may
never
have
to
intervene
and
notions
of
administrative
autonomy
required
that
the
agency
be
given
a
chance
to
discover
and
correct
its
own
errors.
finally
it
is
possible
that
frequent
and
deliberate
clouding
of
administrative
processes
could
reek
in
the
effectiveness
of
an
agency
by
encouraging
people
to
ignore
its
practices.
the
nature
of
the
complaints
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
is
still
what
mr.
justice?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
as
far
as
i
know
the
practice
of
putting
him
in
the
solitary
confinement?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
solitary
confinement
is
being
practiced
in
the
--
what
are
considered
to
be
the
appropriate
cases.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
where
there
is
an
appropriate
case.
now
in
this
particular
instance
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
is
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
practice
has
been
changed.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
let
me
say
this
first
of
all
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
disagree
with
the
findings
of
the
circuit
court.
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case,
judge
arthur
(ph)
in
the
court
below
made
very
extensive
findings
of
fact
and
found
that
the
practice
of
which
he
had
complained
about
was
not
improper,
was
not
illegal,
did
not
violate
any
of
his
constitutional
rights.
we
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
made
a
serious
mistake
in
violating
the
long
established
principles
that
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
court
below
who
had
the
opportunity
to
see
the
witnesses,
to
hear
the
witness,
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
witness,
that
all
of
the
information
before
it,
that
the
fourth
circuit
would
come
in
and
reverse
in
the
manner
in
which
it
did.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
are
you
asking
me,
is
there
solitary
confinement
under
certain
extreme
cases?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no.
like
this
one,
yes,
there
would
be
because
we
said
there
had
not
been
a
violation.
now,
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
the
case
has
not
finally
been
disposed
of
on
its
merits,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
we
say
that
in
the
proper
case,
a
solitary
confinement
is
still
used,
in
the
proper
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
there
is
a
question
about
that,
your
honor
and
i
am
just
saying
if
we
are
not
--
the
state
has
not
abolished
the
practice
where
it
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
inmate
as
it
was
in
this
case,
where
it
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
other
population
of
the
prisons.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
he
was
put
in
isolation
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
him
because
he
had
acted
in
a
very
strange
manner.
he
had
threatened
to
do
harm
to
himself,
his
clothes
were
taken
away
from
so
he
could
not
strangle
himself.
had
it
not
been
done
so
and
had
the
man
taken
his
clothes
or
his
belt
or
his
shirt
or
his
underwear,
whatever
it
might
be
and
hung
himself,
then
it
would
have
been
a
1933
action
in
the
federal
courts
claiming
that
the
state
had
failed
to
do
what
was
necessary
to
protect
this
man
against
himself.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
they
have
psychiatric
provisions.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
tried
to
obtain
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
within
a
matter
of
two
or
three
days,
they
were
able
to
get
the
psychiatrist
to
come
in
and
to
interview
him
and
to
get
him
the
treatment.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
made
an
effort,
over
the
weekends
which
was
in
this
particular
instance,
three
days
weekend
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
am
not
saying
it
is
perfectly
alright.
i
am
saying
that
maybe
somebody
made
a
mistake
in
not
going
out
and
getting
the
particular
psychiatrist,
but
that
does
not
mean
the
system
is
bad.
that
does
not
mean
that
hereafter
that
would
not
be
corrected
and
i
believe
it
will
be
corrected.
i
think
maybe
an
error
was
made
in
that
particular
regard.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
understood
your
question
to
suggest
as
that
maybe
the
whole
question
of
solitary
confinement
was
eliminated
from
the
prisoner
system.
if
that
was
what
your
honor's
question
was
the
answer
is
no.
if
it
was
have
steps
been
taken
to
see
that
in
the
future
if
you
have
a
situation
such
as
this
and
a
psychiatrist
is
needed
or
psychologist
is
needed
and
is
not
available,
that
additional
remedial
steps
will
be
taken
to
see
that
he
is
made
immediately
available,
yes,
those
remedies
have
been
established
and
those
steps
have
been
taken.
and
to
that
extent
i
think
that
is
all
the
state
could
be
expected
to
do,
but
we
say
again,
we
do
not
think
that
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
was
correct
when
it
made
the
determination
that
the
lower
court
was
in
error.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
did.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
facts
as
found,
but
in
effect
said
as
a
matter
of
law
they
are
now
up
to
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
which
we
respectfully
disagree
with.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
court
of
appeals
obviously
would
have
the
right
to
make
whatever
determination
it
saw
fit
(voice
overlap)
the
law.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
we
think
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous
on
the
part
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
make
such
a
finding
of
law
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
established
in
the
record.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
commission
cannot
award
damages.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
do
not
believe
that
it
makes
any
finding
of
fact
with
respect
to
damages,
but
i
do
believe
that
what
it
does,
it
develops
a
record
which
the
federal
district
court
where
a
claimed
for
damages
has
been
made
at
the
appropriate
time,
may
then
have
the
benefit
of
that
record,
a
determination
on
the
face
of
the
record
is
to
whether
there
has
been
a
substantive
denial
which
would
on
the
face
of
it
seemed
to
entitlement
to
damage,
it
was
the
right
for
the
federal
court
then
to
take
such
a
additional
action
as
it
deemed
necessary
such
as
this
testimony
as
it
deemed
necessary
in
order
to
get
full
and
final
relief.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
know
of
none.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
used
it,
mr.
stutman
tells
me
in
summary
judgment
proceedings
in
maryland
and
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
of
the
2504
cases
tried
before
the
inmate
grievance
commission,
about
four
or
five
or
six
of
them
have
subsequently
been
filed
as
civil
action,
civil
rights
action
in
1983
cases
and
in
those
cases
the
record
has
been
made
available
to
the
court
and
the
court
has
made
good
use
of
that
record.
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
last
several
minutes.
there
are
some
other
things
i
would
like
to
point
out.
thank
you.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
may
it
please
the
court.
very
quickly
i
would
like
to
point
out
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
our
view
there
was
no
administrative
remedy
available
in
1871
when
the
1871
act
was
passed.
so
obviously
congress
could
not
have
been
addressing
itself
to
administrative
remedies.
secondly,
as
i
said
the
753
of
the
habeas
corpus
act
which
was
passed
in
1867
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
in
ex
parte
royale
held
that
it
was
discretionary
with
the
court
as
to
whether
exhaustion
shall
be
required.
at
the
least
that
is
what
should
be
held
in
this
case
that
is
discretionary
with
the
lower
court
as
to
whether
there
is
such
an
adequate
administrative
remedy
that
exhaustion
should
be
required.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
basis
for
requiring
exhaustion
is
to
give
the
opportunity
to
the
court,
first
of
all
it
is
federal
comity
--
federalism
in
comity
as
between
national
system
and
the
state
system.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
that
the
same
situation
would
prevail
with
respect
to
the
1983
cases
as
prevail
with
respect
to
the
habeas
corpus
cases.
there
is
certainly
is
far
greater
reason
to
not
permit
exhaustion
of
remedies.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
is
exactly
right
and
so
our
administrative
agencies.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
oh!
yes
they
do,
your
honor.
we
will
so
advise
them
through
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
that
they
must
construe
that
and
you
got
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
certainly
could.
they
have
the
right
to
counsel.
counsel
can
raise
any
issue
before
the
administrative
commission.
we
and
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
represent
the
commission.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
may
hold
that
release
should
be
granted
because
it
would
appear
that
the
particular
regulation
is
unconstitutional.
they
may
hold
that
relief
may
granted.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but
there
is
also
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
state
courts
and
in
the
last
analysis
after
there
has
been
the
sifting
out,
there
is
the
opportunity
to
go
into
the
federal
court
under
1983.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
reading
from.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
right,
mr.
bennett.
i
know
mr.
bennett.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
particular
that
is
left.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
is
this
with
respect
to
the
mccray
case?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
with
respect
to
the
mccray
case?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
i
can
only
say
that
that
certainly
his
opinion
and
i
am
not
into
position
to
comment
upon
that
your
honor.
if
that
is
mr.
bennett’s
opinion,
that
is
his
opinion,
but
we
say
that
at
least
the
court
ought
to
give
the
district
court
the
opportunity
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
adequate
--
the
remedy
is
adequate.
whether
it
be
in
this
case
or
whether
be
in
any
other
cases
or
whether
be
in
any
cases
throughout
the
united
states
because
some
relief
must
be
granted
to
the
states
and
to
the
federal
courts
if
we
are
going
to
see
if
there
is
an
expertise
handling
of
all
of
the
state
prisoner
complaints
throughout
the
united
states.
and
we
say
that
unlike
what
mr.
mccray’s
attorney
has
said,
we
say
that
actually
there
are
four
more
--
far
more
cases
where
there
are
favorable
decisions
in
favor
of
the
inmate
by
virtue
of
the
use
of
the
inmate
grievance
provisions
than
there
are
otherwise
because
of
the
filing
of
the
1983
cases.
i
would
ask
the
court
please
to
look
at
lane
versus
wilson
in
307
u.s.
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
and
carrington
versus
edwards
in
264
f.
2nd
because
i
think
they
give
the
background
historically
of
what
the
1983
cases
permitted
with
respect
to
administrative
remedy.
thank
you.
