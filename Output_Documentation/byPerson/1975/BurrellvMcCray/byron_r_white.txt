involved
i
take
it
as
a
predicate
to
the
damage
award
a
declaration
of
some
breach
of
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
determination
that
they
was
a
violation
of
federal
constitutional
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose
the
underlying
--
what
do
you
understand
the
underlying
argument
for
exhaustion
to
be,
what
is
the
rationale
that
is
been
suggested
as
it
to
avoid
the
decision
of
the
constitutional
issues,
is
that
it
or
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
rationale
as
you
understand
that
is
being
offered
for
a
requirement
of
exhaustion?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
concededly
there
is
no
damage
remedy
and
concededly
i
suppose
the
administrative
processes
in
maryland
prison
is
not
going
to
decide
a
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
administrative
procedures
usually
do
not
declare
some
prison
regulation
unconstitutional
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
not
the
most
that
exhaustion
would
produce
is
a
remedy
that
would
perhaps
obviate
a
result
to
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
go
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
in
the
federal
court
that
there
would
not
be
a
de
novo
determination
based
on
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
think
you
would
be
bound
by
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
if
he
decide
objected
to
the
use
of
the
any
part
of
the
record,
there
might
be
some
trouble
if
the
judge
nevertheless
used
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
understand
that
i
think
you
would
be
here
even
if
you
agree
that
the
prison
procedure,
the
grievance
procedure
was
as
adequate
as
a
grievance
procedure
could
be,
you
would
still
say
that
there
is
no
need
to
exhaust
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
even
though
a
good
inadequate
grievance
procedure
might
screen
out
or
obviate
the
necessity
of
considering
75%
of
the
cases,
nevertheless
the
plaintiff
should
be
able
to
directly
to
file
under
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
basis
for
the
requiring
exhaustion
is
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
if
he
is
claiming
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights,
are
you
suggesting
that
your
administrative
procedure
would
entertain
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
your
state
the
courts
are
bound
by
the
federal
constitution
and
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
you
do
not
usually
act
--
you
do
not
usually
see
administrative
agencies
entertaining
claims
of
constitutional
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
are
going
to
be
adjudicating,
you
can
present
claims
of
eighth
amendment
claims
for
example?m
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
administrative
agency
for
example
could
not
declare
one
of
the
regulations
that
have
been
issued
unconstitutional
at
all?
justice
byron
r.

in
the
