you

justice
thurgood

and

you

marshall
i
respectfully
ask
your
answer
to
my
question.
is
the
practice
still
in
existence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
this
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
are
asking
this
court
to
give
maryland
a
chance
to
take
care
of
its
own
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
had
that
chance
and
you
have
not
done
anything
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
practice
is
still
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
and
stay
there
until
somebody
goes
to
the
state
route,
so
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
i
think
proved,
did
you
he
stripped?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
of
maryland
have
any
psychiatric
treatment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
treat
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall

they
treat
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
you
had
his
clothes
taken
away
from
him
and
he
is
thrown
in
the
cell?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
perfectly
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
general
i
asked
you
had
it
been
corrected,
you
said
it
had
not.
i
guess
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
morgan
may
i
back
of
a
minute?
what
authority
that
says
maryland
commission
had
to
enforce
its
ruling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
issue
an
injunction,
could
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
they
wanted
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
compulsion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you
could
not
--
the
commission
could
not
change
what
was
going
on
in
the
penitentiary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
general
--
mr
attorney
general
you
consider
this
an
adequate
remedy
?three
members
of
the
commission
found
a
grievance
lacking
in
(inaudible)
and
order
the
case
dismissed.
this
member
was
erroneously
listed
as
concurrent
in
the
result.
this
was
apparently
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
there
was
as
usual
no
discussion
of
the
case
among
the
members
prior
to
they
drafted
its
order
and
also
to
the
general
confusion,
din
and
noise
surrounding
the
proceedings,
held
in
the
basement
room
that
had
been
scooped
out
during
the
construction
of
the
maryland
penitentiary
in
1804.
