at
least
the

would
have
standing
to
do
so,
to
raise
the

justice

but
the
fourth
amendment
claim
in
couch
considered
the
nature
of
the
records,
the
deal
not
just
ownership
or
possession
and
indicated
that
these
papers
were
not
private
papers
anyway?
justice

even
if
you
owned
them?

and
that
is
somewhat
a
different
approach,
some
rigid
rule
about
not

what
if
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
the
bank,
not
your
clients,
but
investigating
the
bank
and
they
served
the
same
subpoena
and
the
bank
had
objected
it
on
fourth
amendment
grounds.
you

there
when
you
under

well,
walling
said
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
inapplicable,
but
the
reasonable
of
equivalent
of
a
probable
cause
is
the
need
of
the
grand
jury
or
the
government
to
investigate
violations
of
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
(voice

you
would
say
that
such
traditional
function
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
hardly
responsive
to
my
purpose
in
walling,
is
it,
how
would
you
respond
to
it,
how
would
the
bank
respond
to
the
subpoena
for
its
own
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
in
behalf
of
the
bank?
justice
byron

white
what
if
the
records
here
were
in
possession
of
the
taxpayer
himself?
what
if
they
subpoenaed
his
own
records?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
that.
i
am
talking
about
his
fourth
amendment
rights,
a
subpoena
to
your
client
for
his
own
records
investigating
his
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
walling
and
cases
like
that
continued
that
approach
insofar
as
the
subpoena
in
the
fourth
amendment
are
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
it
--
you
are
asking
here
to
apply
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
subpoena
situation,
not
to
invasions
of
some
other
protected
areas?

respect
to
the
subpoena
of
what
--
of
certain
documents
in
which
you
say
they
have
some
privacy
interest.
now,
surely
you
would
not
think
that
fourth
amendment
would
protect
these
documents
in
the
hands
of
the
bank
if
they
would
not
protect
them
in
the
hands
of
the
depositor?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
standing
argument
sounds
like,
when
we
are
just
saying
this
--
what
i
really
mean
is
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
here
with
respect
to
the
owner
--
with
respect
to
the
depositor?
