and
i
got
some
records

i
will
give
them
to

yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you

a
little
trouble
there,
have
you

justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
an
accountant
is
less
obliged
to
protect
the
secrecy
than
the
bank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
it
gives
the
agent
the
exact
check
and
not
a
copy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
did,
what
would
you

could
u.s.
attorney’s
office
use
it?
justice
thurgood

and
you
do
not
think
this
was
voluntary?

is
everybody’s
knowledge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
against
the
fact
that
the
banks
do
microfilm
to
checks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
us
to
say
that
while
we
can
compel,
while
the
congress
can
compel
them
to
microfilm,
nobody
can
use
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
good
is
the
microfilm
if
they
cannot
use
it?
