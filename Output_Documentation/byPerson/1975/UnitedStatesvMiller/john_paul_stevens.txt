the

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
we
go
back
to
your
standing
argument
for
a
minute.
does
it
really
make
any
difference
whose
papers
they
were
as
long
they
are
in
the
custody
of
the
bank?
you
seem
to
stress
the
fact
that
they
are
the
bank’s
papers,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
is
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
--
would
your
argument
be
--
your
standing
argument
be
precisely
the
same
regardless
of
who
owned
the
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rampey,
would
you
say
your
client’s
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
if
the
government
lawyer
had
written
a
letter
to
the
bank
and
said,
please
turn
over
the
following
documents
and
if
you
do
not
turn
them
over
voluntarily,
we
will
get
a
grand
jury
subpoena
and
the
bank
had
responded
to
the
letter
by
doing
just
what
it
did
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rampey,
do
you
disagree
with
the
government’s
statement
that
these
records
were
the
property
of
the
bank
rather
than
the
property
of
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
object
to
the
search
as
well
as
the
seizure
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
object
to
the
search
as
well
as
the
taking
possession
of
the
records?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
object
even
if
an
agent
had
gone
in
and
voluntarily
requested
to
see
them
without
any
process
at
all,
you
would
make
precisely
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
same
argument
on
the
letter,
the
example
i
gave
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
your
argument
not
be
the
same
even
if
he
asked
for
just
one
check
instead
for
four
months
of
records?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
scope
of
the
subpoena
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
fourth
amendment
contention?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
standing
argument
please.
do
you
contend
that
this
test
of
standing
is
the
same
when
you
are
asking
whether
one
can
object
to
a
subpoena
as
it
is
when
one
is
asked
to
make
an
objection
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
on
the
fourth
amendment
ground?
i
am
not
wondering
--
i
am
wondering
if
you
are
not
confusing
two
different
kinds
of
standing
questions
in
your
brief.
do
you
understand
what
i
am
asking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
when
you
are
talking
about
standing
attack
a
subpoena,
the
question
of
ownership
would
not
be
relevant
or
is
it
might
be
relevant
when
you
are
talking
about
standing
to
raise
a
fourth
amendment
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
no
one
else
is
your
position?
