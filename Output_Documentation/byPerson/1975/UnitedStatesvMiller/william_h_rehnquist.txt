justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
grand
jury
itself
direct
or
asked
the
u.s.
attorney
to
subpoena
a
particular
witness
that
it
wanted
to
hear?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
state
law
recognized
such
a
privilege,
would
that
have
to
be
conclusive
as
to
the
disposition
of
a
federal
question
such
as
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rampey,
are
you
saying
in
response
to
the
chief
justiceâ€™s
question
that
assuming
the
subpoena
had
been
proper
and
a
proper
return
had
been
made
that
these
bank
records
are
simply
immune
from
any
sort
of
discovery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
then
what
showing
does
the
government
have
to
make
in
order
to
discover
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
what
showing
does
the
government
have
to
make
if
they
are
not
absolutely
immune?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
government
develop
probable
cause
except
running
down
leads
such
as
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
would
just
wipe
out
any
successful
prosecution
of
white
collar
crime,
with
your
suggestion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
had
been
doing
that
for
years
with
subpoenas.
so
they
were
--
it
is
you
that
is
asking
for
the
change,
not
the
government?
