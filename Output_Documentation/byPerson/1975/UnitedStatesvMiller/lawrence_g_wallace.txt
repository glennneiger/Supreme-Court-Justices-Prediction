mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
fourth
amendment
claims,
concerning
two
grand
jury
subpoenas
of
the
bank
records.
in
january
1973,
while
fighting
a
fire
at
a
warehouse
in
kathleen,
georgia
which
was
rented
to
the
respondent,
local
law
enforcement
officials
discovered
a
distillery,
a
quantity
of
non-tax-paid
whiskey
and
related
paraphernalia.
several
weeks
earlier
a
van-type
truck
occupied
by
two
of
respondents,
later
alleged
co-conspirators
was
stopped
on
the
basis
of
information
from
an
informant
and
found
to
contain
distillery
apparatus.
as
a
result
of
these
two
incidents,
two
grand
jury
subpoenas
were
issued
from
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
to
banks
in
nearby
communities
in
which
the
respondent
had
bank
accounts.
this
was
in
the
conduct
of
the
investigation
being
conducted
by
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
and
treasury
department
agents
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury..
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
subpoenas
was
to
determine
whether
the
records
of
the
respondent's
account
would
reflect
transactions
that
would
connect
him
with
the
maintenance
or
operation
of
the
distillery
discovered
during
the
fire
with
its
proceeds
and
that
would
connect
that
operation
with
the
van
that
had
been
stopped
a
few
weeks
earlier.
and
i
would
to
interject
at
the
outset
that
this
is
a
normal
method
of
investigating
an
incident
of
this
kind
and
we
believe
an
entirely
proper
line
of
investigation,
if
anything,
and
major
thrust
of
this
court’s
criminal
procedure
decisions
in
the
past
forty
years
has
been
to
encourage
law
enforcement
officials
to
seek
objective,
reliable,
documentary,
real
evidence
of
the
sort
from
third
parties
rather
than
focus
the
investigation
entirely
on
trying
to
illicit
incriminating
statements
from
the
suspects
themselves.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
issued,
yes.
they
were
cooperating
with
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
conduct
of
the
investigation,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
this
was
non-tax-paid
whiskey
that
had
been
discovered.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
an
investigation
--
what
they
issued
were
subpoenas
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury,
a
criminal
investigation,
a
grand
jury
investigation
and
the
subpoenas
were
issued
out
of
the
united
states
attorney’s
office.
no
inquiry
was
made
at
the
hearing
and
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
presumably,
the
subpoenas
were
issued
in
compliance
with
rule
17
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
provides
for
their
issuance
in
blank
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
parties
to
proceedings.
this
has
been
applied
to
grand
jury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
who
were
--
yes,
they
were
assisting,
as
fbi
agents
often
assist
the
us
attorney
in
the
conduct
of
investigation
on
preparatory
to
grand
jury
proceedings.
this
case
was
a
federal
offense
that
the
treasury
department
is
concerned
within
its
investigations.
the
banks
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
rule
does
not
specify,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
the
subpoenas
to
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
attorneys.
the
rule
was
really
drafted
for
trial
subpoenas
and
has
been
applied
by
analogy
to
grand
jury
subpoenas,
but
the
drafting
does
not
fit
the
grand
jury
situation
precisely.
in
any
event,
it
is
the
normal
practice
to
have
the
subpoenas
in
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
for
issuance
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
issue
a
trial
subpoena,
yes.
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
normal
method
used.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
case
may
not
go
to
the
grand
jury,
but
the
idea
is
seeking
information
that
can
be
presented
to
the
grand
jury.
sometimes
the
case
proceeds
by
information
rather
than
indictment.
eventually,
this
one
did
go
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
until
proceedings
have
been
brought.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does,
it
does
at
--
in
its
application
to
trial
subpoenas,
but
not
a
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
the
grand
jury
subpoena.
this
is
the
way
the
grand
jury
subpoenas
evidence
so
that
they
can
function.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
not
anybody.
the
subpoena
is
issued
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
the
attorney
for
the
grand
jury
who
is
the
united
states
attorney
and
it
is
issued
in
blank
and
then
filled
out
as
the
united
states
attorney,
acting
on
behalf
of
the
grand
jury
seeks
evidence
for
presentation
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
although
in
this
case,
the
evidence
did
go
to
the
grand
jury.
often,
there
is
voluminous
evidence
only
some
of
which
would
be
pertinent
to
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
after
it
is
screened
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
certainly
could
or
it
could
issue
a
subpoena
on
its
own,
but
in
a
situation
like
this
one
in
particular
where
the
grand
jury
is
not
in
continuous
session,
in
fact,
it
is
infrequently,
and
this
is
a
non-urban
area
and
the
grand
jury
sessions
are
infrequent
and
of
short
duration.
the
common
thing
is
for
the
united
states
attorney
to
act
on
its
behalf,
gather
the
evidence
for
presentation
to
the
grand
jury,
otherwise
service
on
the
grand
jury
which
often
entails
long
distances
of
driving
for
people
in
a
rural
district
of
this
kind
would
become
a
very
burdensome
thing.
well,
in
this
case
the
banks
complied
with
the
subpoena
without
actually
attending
a
grand
jury
session
by
handing
the
information
over
to
the
agents
working
with
the
united
states
attorney,
so
that
it
could
be
then
presented
by
them
to
grand
jury
later
on.
and
the
grand
jury
did
indict
the
respondent
and
four
others
on
five
counts
of
violations
related
to
the
operation
of
the
distillery.
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
evidence
secured
by
the
subpoenas
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
at
the
trial,
some
evidence
procured
by
these
subpoenas
was
introduced
and
the
subpoenas
also
gave
the
investigators
some
leads
that
may
have
led
to
other
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
and
the
respondent
was
convicted
on
all
five
counts,
so
that
he
was
charged
and
given
concurrent
sentences
of
three
years
imprisonment.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
held
that
his
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
should
have
been
granted
on
the
three
grounds
asserted
in
that
motion
and
the
government’s
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied
by
an
eight
to
seven
of
vote
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
our
view,
the
basic
error
at
the
court
of
appeals,
the
panel’s
opinion
and
decision
in
this
case
is
in
its
holding
that
the
alleged
defects
in
the
subpoena
violated
as
that
court
put
the
respondents
right
to
privacy
in
the
bank’s
records
of
his
account.
it
seems
to
us
this
holding
departs
from
this
court’s
admonition
in
katz
against
the
united
states
that
the
fourth
amendment
cannot
be
translated
into
a
general
constitutional
right
to
privacy.
pertinent
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case,
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
person,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizure
shall
not
be
violated.
now,
katz
held
that
that
right
to
be
securing
one's
person,
includes
security
from
unreasonable
intrusions
by
the
uninvited
ear
of
the
government
as
well
as
other
protections,
but
neither
katz
nor
any
other
case
of
this
court
has
ever
held
that
these
protections
apply
to
anything
other
than
the
claimant's
own
person,
houses,
papers,
or
effects.
in
fact,
the
rule
has
been
precisely
the
contrary
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
what
is
often
referred
to
as
just
tertiary
interests.
that
it
is
only
the
person
whose
own
person,
papers,
house
or
effects
are
the
subject
of
the
search
and
has
standing
to
complain
of
non-compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment,
not
someone
against
whom
that
evidence
may
later
be
used.
this
has
been
reiterated
time
and
again.
the
modern
cases
that
spell
it
out
start
with
goldstein
against
the
united
states
and
go
on
through
jones,
wong
sun
and
alderman,
all
of
which
are
quite
specific
on
this
point
and
the
court
has
also
applied
this
doctrine
with
specific
reference
to
the
papers
of
third
parties
that
concern
transactions
between
those
third
parties
and
the
person
seeking
to
complain
of
the
intrusion
into
those
papers.
it
was
done
in
both
donaldson
against
the
united
states,
involving
a
former
employer's
records,
concerning
donaldson
and
then
later
in
california
bankers
against
shultz,
where
the
court
pointed
out
that
as
long
ago
as
1925,
it
had
decided
that
an
internal
revenue
summons
directed
to
a
third
party
bank
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
either
the
bank
or
the
person
under
investigation
by
the
taxing
authorities
and
then
quoted
with
approval,
mr.
justice
douglas’
statement
concurring
in
donaldson
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
summoning
of
a
third
party
and
the
records
of
a
third
party
can
violate
the
rights
of
the
tax
payer,
even
if
a
criminal
prosecution
is
contemplated
or
in
progress,
which
seems
to
us
to
be
directly
on
point
here.
as
the
court
also
pointed
out
in
couch
against
the
united
states,
the
landmark
precedent
concerning
the
fourth
amendment
protection
of
private
papers,
boyd
against
the
united
states
did
not
contemplate,
the
court
said
in
couch,
the
divergence
of
ownership
and
possession
of
the
papers
and
a
fortiori
it
did
not
contemplate
the
complete
lack
of
possession
or
ownership
of
the
papers
by
the
person
making
the
complaint
which
is
the
situation
here.
these
records
are
owned
and
maintained
by
the
banks.
they
are
the
banks
records
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
also
a
fourth
amendment
claim
in
couch
which
the
court
rejected
and
discussed.
it
is
true
that
this
case
is
only
a
fourth
amendment
case,
but
i
do
not
think
that
makes
couch
less
precedent
for
that
it
rejected
claims
under
both
amendments,
mr.
justice.
so,
the
papers
themselves
belong
to
the
bank,
their
papers
which
the
bank
had
consent
to
a
search
of
without
any
right
of
the
petitioner
to
prevent
the
bank
from
voluntarily
turning
them
over
to
the
government
under
this
court’s
consent
search
cases.
and,
this
leaves
only
the
question
whether
because
the
information
was
secured
from
the
petitioner's
checks
and
in
the
course
of
transactions
between
the
petitioner
and
the
bank
whether
that
information
is
somehow
protected
or
whether
the
petitioner
has
standing
to
claim
that
the
information
cannot
be
disclosed
by
the
bank
to
the
government.
this
is
in
our
view
not
really
a
fourth
amendment
claim,
but
because
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
against
the
disclosure
of
the
information
itself
that
was
pointed
out
in
united
states
against
white,
that
the
person
with
whom
--
had
the
conversation
in
katz
could
later
testify
about
it,
so
long
as
it
was
a
non-privilege
conversation
and
not
a
confidential
communication
with
a
privileged
relationship.
the
protection
of
the
information
itself
is
really
the
providence
of
the
law
of
testimony
or
privileges
for
confidential
communications.
and
here,
there
is
no
such
privilege
recognized
between
a
bank
and
a
bank
customer
anymore
than
there
is
between
an
individual
and
his
accountant
or
others
with
whom
he
conducts
business
transactions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice
because
whether
such
a
privilege
would
be
honored
in
the
federal
courts
or
with
bar
of
the
testimony
of
bank
officials
as
to
their
transactions
with
an
individual
would
be
a
question
of
federal
law
and
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
will
of
course
bear
on
it.
but
no
state
to
my
knowledge
recognizes
such
a
testimony
or
privilege.
there
maybe
rights,
there
maybe
some
rights
of
confidentiality
in
one’s
bank
records
as
against
disclosure
to
third
persons,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
testimonial
privilege
to
refuse
in
response
to
proper
legal
process
to
testify
about,
after
all
these
are
the
banks
own
transactions,
and
they
have
been
common
source
of
evidence
in
both
state
and
federal
criminal
prosecutions
for
many,
many
years
as
the
court
recognized
in
california
bankers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
answer
would
be
the
same.
there
might
be
some
contractual
right
there,
some
basis
for
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract,
but
a
contract
cannot
amend
the
legal
process
that
is
provided
for
by
congress
and
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
securing
evidence
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
was
not
notified
by
either
the
united
states
attorney
or
by
the
bank
or
by
either
bank?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
standing
under
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
justice.
we
do
not
address
the
possibility
of
standing
under
the
first
amendment
if
the
allegation
which
is
not
made
here
is
that
this
is
an
improper
inquiry
into
his
associational
activity
or
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
not
required
to
do
so.
it
could
have
com
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
whether
that
kind
of
a
contractual
remedy
would
be
a
proper
way
of
interfering
with
the
execution
of
federal
process
is
something
that
does
not
have
to
be
reached
in
this
case
and
i
do
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
would
have
standing
to
bring
such
a
suit,
but
he
may
not
have
a
cause
of
action
there.
but
here,
there
was
no
problem
of
that
sort
and
indeed
what
the
district
court
said
was
that
the
bank
had
really
voluntarily
handed
the
records
over
after
receiving
the
subpoena.
now,
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
of
the
bank
secrecy
act
which
in
our
view
does
not
change
the
situation.
we
are
not
involved
here
with
the
reporting
requirements
of
that
act
which
were
the
subject
of
the
concerns
expressed
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
california
bankers
of
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
we
are
concerned
here
only
with
the
record
keeping
requirements
and
those
requirements
do
not
change
the
fact
that
the
records
belong
to
the
bank
and
are
records
of
its
own
financial
transactions.
i
do
not
see
any
basis
on
which
those
record
keeping
requirements
would
lead
to
a
difference
in
the
result
on
this
issue.
now,
our
basic
position,
therefore,
is
that
that
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
matter
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
complaint
by
the
respondent
about
alleged
defects
in
the
subpoena
should
not
have
been
entertained.
we
do
not
urge,
however,
that
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter
in
this
court,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
because
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
hold
that
the
subpoenas
were
defective
in
three
respects
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
course
of
action
here
that
it
adopted
in
donaldson
where
after
holding
that
mr.
donaldson
did
not
have
a
right
to
intervene,
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
internal
revenue
summons
and
nonetheless
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issue
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
fact
that
it
had
been
presented
to
the
court
went
on
to
decide
that
the
summons
was
being
used
to
for
a
proper
purpose
in
any
event
which
was
the
issue
that
mr.
donaldson
had
sought
to
raise
through
his
attempted
intervention.
here,
there
is
even
more
reason
to
go
on
and
comment
about
these
alleged
defects
in
the
subpoena
because
unlike
the
situation
in
donaldson,
there
is
a
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
subject
which
technically
would
be
vacated,
still
a
holding
that
would
be
troublesome
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
fifth
circuit
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
united
servicemen’s
fund
against
eastland.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
recall
whether
we
did
have
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
one
of
the
cases
most
closely
on
point
because
it
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
case
was
primarily
about
the
scope
of
the
debate
clause
and
it
was
a
case
which
raised
first
amendment
claims
rather
than
fourth
amendment
claims
so
it
seemed
to
us
not
as
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
would
put
in
the
context,
that
was
their
claim,
but
in
the
context
of
the
first
amendment
claim
and
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
fourth
amendment
claim
which
as
i
said
earlier
we
do
not
equate
with
the
claim
of
a
right
to
privacy.
it
is
a
claim
about
improper
intrusion
into
the
person’s
papers,
effects
which
are
not
the
respondents
and
it
seems
to
us
to
be
an
end
of
the
matter
with
respect
to
a
standing
to
raise
that
kind
of
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
couch
even
if
they
were
the
respondent’s
papers,
if
he
had
relinquished
possession
of
them
to
the
bank
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
just
adds
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
--
it
is
a
sort
of
an
a
fortiori
argument
since
the
papers
are
not
in
the
respondent's
possession,
in
actual
or
constructive,
there
is
no
basis
for
asserting
a
possessory
interest
and
couch
disposes
of
this
claim
on
that
ground
alone,
but
we
never
took
the
position
in
couch
that
mrs.
couch
could
not
be
heard
to
assert
the
claim
that
she
still
had
constructive
possession
over
her
records.
so,
that
there
is
more
of
a
basis
for
standing
to
complain.
in
the
owner
of
the
records,
if
there
is
a
proprietary
interest,
i
think
there
is
some
implication
in
donaldson
also,
that
that
can
be
a
basis
for
a
standing
to
complain
which
may
well
be
rejected
on
the
merits
as
it
was
in
both
of
those
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
might
well.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
well
the
fourth
amendment
claim,
that
was
also
rejected
in
couch.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
in
that
case
they
were
the
complainant’s
records,
there
was
ownership
and
we
have
in
our
brief
analogized
to
those
considerations
in
couch
by
pointing
out
that
the
checks
here
are
cast
upon
a
sea
of
commerce
over
which
the
respondent
has
no
control.
i
do
think
it
will
have
to
and
he
has
no
control
over
the
endorsements,
who
will
see
the
information
etcetera.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
it
applies
only
to
the
checks.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
deposit
slips,
but
even
where
privilege
has
been
recognized
for
confidential
communications
that
has
been
held
not
to
apply
to
transactions,
but
only
to
confidential
communications,
transactions
between
the
attorney
and
client,
the
amount
of
the
fee,
the
identity
of
the
client
are
held
not
to
be
privileged
under
the
attorney-client
privilege
for
example.
i
will
have
to
leave
to
our
brief
the
discussion
of
the
alleged
defects
in
the
subpoena.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
just
briefly
mr.
chief
justice.
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
involved
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
only
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
one's
own
person,
affects,
papers
etcetera.
if
there
is
to
be
privacy
protection
afforded
to
third
party
records
that
is
a
matter
for
legislative
consideration.
it
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
right.
we
have
pointed
out
on
page
31
of
our
brief
in
footnote
21,
bills
that
has
been
introduced
in
congress
on
this
subject
and
have
also
pointed
out
legislation
that
exists
with
respect
to
telephone
company
records
and
the
records
of
credit
reporting
agencies
where
congress
has
seen
fit
to
provide
some
legislative
protection.
now
here,
there
is
no
allegation
of
improper
disclosure
of
any
matters
relating
to
the
respondent's
personal
affairs.
the
only
allegation
is
that
these
were
exposed
to
the
agents
conducting
a
proper
government
investigation.
and
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
one
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
not
cited
in
the
brief
is
rule
6
(e)
does
contemplate
that
government
attorneys
will
seek
grand
jury
evidence
in
the
performance
in
the
course
of
their
duties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
would
be
different.
it
is
the
person
subpoenaed
who
has
standing
to
object
to
the
subpoena
and
since
the
person
against
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
anyone
who
is
unduly
burdened
by
the
need
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
has
standing
to
complain
about
the
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
no
one
else.
it
is
only
the
one
who
has
to
comply
with
it
because
the
subpoena
is
very
comparable
to
the
letter
that
you
are
posing.
hypothetically
it
is
merely
request
to
produce
information
and
if
the
person
subpoenaed
wants
to
object
to
that
that
it
is
too
burdensome
for
him
to
do
so
that
it
violates
his
fourth
amendment
rights
or
that
their
--
that
the
subpoena
is
defective
in
some
way,
he
may
do
so.
if
he
does
not
raise
such
an
objection,
it
stand
him
out
to
voluntarily
turning
over
the
records
in
response
to
an
oral
or
written
request
that
is
not
labeled
as
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
a
different
question.
it
is
a
different
question
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
a
different
question,
but
the
answer
to
the
question
has
been
that
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
context
of
seeking
to
exclude
evidence
does
not
protect
just
tertiary
interest.
it
does
not
protect,
some
of
them
having
evidence
used
against
him
which
was
taken
in
violation
of
someone
else’s
fourth
amendment
rights.
it
just
happens
here
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
anyway,
but
the
standing
point
is
still
in
the
case.
the
answer
is
the
answer
given
in
wong
sun
when
it
was
said
that
the
evidence
could
be
used
against
one
of
the
defendants,
although
not
against
the
other
one
whose
premises
were
violated,
whose
rights
and
premises
were
violated.
that
is
the
answer
to
it.
it
is
a
standing
issue.
it
is
obscured
slightly
in
this
case
because
it
is
in
our
view
fairly
obvious
that
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
of
anyone’s
rights
here.
thank
you.
