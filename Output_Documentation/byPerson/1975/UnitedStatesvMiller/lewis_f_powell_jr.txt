mr.
wallace,
was
the
customer
of
the
bank
notified
in
this
case
of
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
suppose
a
bank
could
have
got
the
policy
of
notifying
customers
whenever
a
customerâ€™s
record
is
subpoenaed
and
that
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
that
the
customer
would
have
no
standing
to
go
into
court
at
that
point
and
attempt
to
enjoin
the
implementation
of
the
subpoena
and
say
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
fishing
expedition
or
otherwise
invalid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
ramsey.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
records
involved
in
this
case
had
been
those
of
a
department
store
that
had
extended
credit
to
your
client,
would
you
have
a
different
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
your
client
had
been
extended
credit
by
a
department
store.
it
obviously
had
records
of
the
account
with
your
client.
let
us
assume
that
the
u.s.
attorney
had
issued
a
subpoena
to
obtain
those
records?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
lee
rampey.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me
the
extent
to
which
you
rely
on
the
bank
records
act.
would
you
be
here
today
if
that
act
were
not
on
the
books?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
banks
traditionally
have
had
ledger
accounts
just
like
reflecting
the
accounts
of
their
customers,
obviously
they
have
to
maintain
records?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
this
case
had
risen
before
the
bank
records
act,
do
you
think
the
subpoena
would
have
been
alright
for
such
records
that
may
then
have
existed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
apart
from
that,
assuming
you
had
a
valid
subpoena,
as
you
view
it,
such
records
as
a
bank
then
had,
could
have
been
subpoenaed
without
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
respondent,
in
this
case,
was
convicted
of
possessing
a
175
gallons
of
whiskey
upon
which
he
had
paid
no
taxes.
prior
to
his
trial,
he
moved
to
suppress
copies
of
his
checks,
deposit
slips
and
other
bank
records
deemed
by
him
to
be
incriminating.
these
records
have
been
obtained
by
subpoenas
duces
tecum
served
upon
two
banks
in
which
respondent
maintained
accounts.
the
banks
maintained
these
records
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
bank
secrecy
act
of
1970.
the
district
court
declined
to
suppress
the
records
but
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
in
concluding
that
the
records
had
been
obtained
by
defective
subpoenas,
thereby
violating
respondent's
fourth
amendment
rights.
we
take
a
different
view,
the
records
subpoenaed
were
not
respondent's
private
papers
rather
they
were
business
records
of
the
banks
even
with
respect
to
the
original
checks
and
deposit
slips
copied
by
the
banks,
respondent
having
made
these
available
to
a
third
party
could
have
had
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
contents.
the
depositor
takes
the
risk,
in
revealing
his
affairs
to
another
in
the
course
of
commercial
transactions
that
the
information
maybe
conveyed
to
the
government.
we
conclude
therefore
that
there
was
no
intrusion
upon
protected
fourth
amendment
interest
of
respondent
and
that
the
district
court
correctly
denied
respondent's
motion
to
suppress.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
