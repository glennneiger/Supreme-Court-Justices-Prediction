chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
against
miller,
74-1179.
mr.
wallace
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
rule,
mr.
wallace
that
requires
a
member
of
the
bar
to
request
the
subpoena,
that
is
to
physically
receive
it
from
the
clerk
or
a
member
of
the
bar
send
a
messenger
for
a
grand
jury
subpoena?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
does
authorize
the
issuance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
case
was
it
mr.
wallace
if
you
remember,
within
the
last
year
or
eighteen
months
in
which
senate
committee
in
conducting
an
inquiry
had
subpoenaed
bank
records
of
an
organization
which
it
was
investigating,
that
is
they
were
investigating
the
organization
and
the
sources
of
its
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
believe
(voice
overlap)
you
have
not
cited
that,
have
you?
i
could
not
find
it
in
your
--
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
think
it
has
any
bearing
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
a
standing
issue
of
the
organization,
of
the
depositor
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
privacy
issue
would
be
common
to
both,
would
it
not?
was
not
that
the
claim
of
the
united
servicemen’s
organization
that
this
was
a
violation
of
their
right
of
privacy
and
that
it
would
open
to
public
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
since
we
rejected
the
couch,
the
fifth
amendment
case,
claim
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rampey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
point
that
it
makes
some
difference
whether
the
united
states
attorney
did
it
personally
or
it
was
an
fbi
agent
or
a
united
states
marshal
or
one
of
his
secretaries?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
agent,
a
part
of
the
united
states
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
is
the
united
states
attorney
an
agent
of
the
united
states
government,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
change
and
give
you
another
variation
of
these
hypothetical
cases
that
had
been
put
to
you.
as
you
know,
some
people
who
receive
checks,
particularly
businesses
make
a
microfilm
of
every
check
they
receive
and
suppose
somewhere
along
the
line,
one
of
the
holders
in
due
course
of
this
man’s
checks
had
made
microfilms.
now
he
is
not
a
banker,
he
is
simply
a
person
who
received
that
check
in
due
course
and
while
he
had
it
of
course
he
had
a
property
right
in
it,
you
would
agree
i
am
sure.
now,
could
a
subpoena
reach
that
check
in
the
hands
of
that
former
holder
in
due
course
of
the
check?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
original
goes
back
to
the
issuer,
does
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
the
microfilm
copy
of
that
check
is
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
holders
in
due
course
and
they
may
have
been,
it
might
have
three
or
you
might
have
30
conceivably.
now,
is
that
the
right
of
privacy
is
the
same,
is
it
not,
in
this
case
in
my
hypothetical?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
frequently
the
government
does
that
when
they
are
making
a
tax
fraud
case,
do
they
not,
a
net
worth
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
problem
about
getting
that
kind
of
subpoena?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
a
defensive
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
the
privacy
point.
if
you
distinguish
this
to
pickup
the
net
worth
tax
case,
how
distinguish
the
right
of
privacy
here
from
right
of
privacy
that
is
involved
when
the
government
is
making
a
net
worth
tax
fraud
case
using
bank
records
and
great
many
other
types
of
records,
accountant’s
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
were
in
the
hands
of
his
accountant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
the
bank
examiners?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sir?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
74-1179,
united
states
against
miller
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
