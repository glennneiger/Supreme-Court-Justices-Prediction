mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
lee
rampey.
i
represent
the
respondent
in
this
case
ever
since
this
whole
case
started.
let
me
very
quickly
make
a
factual
condensation,
if
i
can,
of
this
case
in
regards
to
these
subpoenas.
i
think
the
appendix
that
the
court
has
before
it
is
within
about
60
pages
in
length
and
it
will
show
that
the
subpoenas
were
apparently
completed
and
as
the
government
concedes
issued
in
the
united
states
attorney’s
office,
two
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearm
agents
came
and
picked
up
the
subpoenas.
one
issued
to
c&s
bank
of
warner
robins,
georgia.
one
to
the
bank
of
byron,
two
small
state
type
banks,
obviously
federally
regulated
and
subject
to
the
bank
secrecy
act.
they
went
there.
they
served
the
subpoenas
at
the
c&s
bank
of
warner
robins.
the
agent
secured
all
of
the
information
he
has
for
over
a
four
month
period.
copies
of
the
checks,
financial
statements,
deposit
slips,
everything
he
requested
in
regards
to
miller’s
financial
transactions
at
the
c&s
bank
of
warner
robins.
those
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
rule
17
is
cast
in
terms
of
a
party
requesting
a
subpoena
in
blank
and
it
being
used
in
that
matter.
the
reason
i
am
going
over
this
point
is
to
show
that
really
as
a
practical
matter
the
only
people
that
knew
what
was
going
on
as
to
these
documents,
the
use
of
these
subpoenas
was
the
atf
agents
and
to
some
unknown
extent,
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
because
here,
the
atf
agent
retain
the
documents
that
he
secured
from
the
two
banks
in
his
possession
from
the
time
that
he
received
them
until
the
time
of
the
hearing.
in
the
appendix
at
page
41
and
42,
the
agent
is
sitting
right
there
on
the
stand
in
april,
three
months
after
he
had
secured
the
documents
from
the
bank,
he
is
sitting
there
and
he
has
all
the
papers
and
that
these
documents
and
exhibits
right
out
of
the
banks
are
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
for
your
inspection.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
is
an
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
agent
and
a
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
i
do
not
think
the
agent
is
necessarily.
the
united
states
attorney
has
at
my
request
subpoenas
in
behalf
of
the
party
i
--
he
--
the
united
states
of
america,
but
my
point
is
that
there
was
no
return
of
these
subpoenas
to
the
court
where
they
were
purported
to
be
issued
from.
the
agent
says,
well,
i
have
filled
in
the
information
and
i
still
have
the
original
subpoenas.
there
was
no
notice
to
the
defender,
no
return
to
the
court.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
think
they
still
would
have
been,
yes
sir,
i
do
because
i
do
not
think
a
depositor,
i
think
that
a
depositor
has
even
under
this
court’s
rulings
and
more
recently
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
ruled
under
their
constitutional
provisions
that
a
bank
depositor
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
under
their
equivalent
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
sanctity
of
those
documents.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
there
are
some
cases
cited
in
my
brief
mr.
justice,
where
a
right
of
action
and
contract
is
available.
i
think
though
that
here,
the
depositor
does
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
not
if
he
does
it
on
his
own
without
any
governmental
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
that
is
true,
but
there
is
no
governmental
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
our
point
is
that
these
subpoenas
number
one
were
invalid
as
a
process
of
a
grand
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
because
if
the
government
intervenes
to
some
extent
in
the
procurement
of
these
records
and
documents
in
which
we
content
the
depositor
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
is
justifiable,
then
this
gives
--
this
is
the
same
situation
as
where,
for
example
a
secret
service
agent
asked
an
airline
employee
to
search
a
piece
of
baggage
and
he
does
so,
i
think
this
court
has
ruled
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
his
accountant?
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
but
that
is
not
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes,
i
do
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
number
one
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
think
banks
are
more
obliged
to
protect
the
secrecy
in
this
instance
because
number
one,
the
records
are
compelled
to
be
kept
by
banks
under
the
bank
secrecy
act
and
number
two,
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
these
records
and
documents.
the
banks
really
do
not
necessarily
have
to
have
all
of
these
copies
of
the
checks
and
documents.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
the
bank
would
have
no
right
to
do
that.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
the
bank
should
be
sued
because
they
have
no
right
to
the
check
in
the
first
place.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
they
could
if
it
were
voluntarily
handed
over.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
but
this
court
has
also
held
that,
for
example
a
landlord
cannot
go
in
on
his
own
and
allow
the
law
enforcement
officers
to
go
in
and
search
a
house
where
a
distillery
is
located.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
but
we
are
contending
that
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
--
as
a
matter
of
pure
property
law,
that
is
correct
but
we
are
contending
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
these
microfilmed
records
that
are
kept
under
the
bank
secrecy
act
that
these
are
not,
otherwise
even
prior
to
the
act,
not
normally
kept
by
the
banks.
in
fact,
one
of
the
two
banks
should
never
keep
it.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
hope
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
to
records
of
a
department
store?
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
because
number
one
that
would
expose
only
his
transactions
with
that
department
store.
the
records
that
we
are
talking
about
today
are
records
that
even
as
conceded
in
the
california
bankers
association
case
are
records
that
really
tell
more
about
the
individual.
they
ought
to
be
protected.
in
our
arguments
they
ought
to
be
protected.
they
show
a
person’s
lifestyle,
his
thoughts,
what
he
does
with
his
money,
what
his
politics
might
be,
what
his
problems
are,
almost
anything
you
can
find
out
about
a
person,
you
can
find
out
from
his
financial
records.
and
i
think
even
donaldson,
we
contend
that
donaldson
is
distinguishable
in
this
particular
instance.
number
one,
donaldson
was
not
a
constitutional
case
in
the
sense
of
this
case.
it
was
a
question
of
whether
not
the
taxpayer
had
a
right
to
intervene
and
we
would
argue
that
the
language
in
donaldson
is
basically
from
rule
24
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
whether
or
not
he
had
right
to
intervene
to
protect
an
interest
relating
to
property.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
if
he
still
retained
the
original,
yes
sir
i
think
so,
but
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
oh,
the
microfilm?
yes.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
would
argue
not.
no
sir,
i
would
argue
not
for
the
reason
that
as
i
again
indicated,
that
exposes
only
one
single
transaction.
this
case
right
here
is
a
graphic
example
of
a
way
you
can
get
four
months
of
a
man’s
total
financial
life
unfolded
before
you
with
what
we
contend
are
illegal
grand
jury
subpoenas.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
our
contention
is
to
the
subpoenas
itself
are
that
the
subpoenas
were
improperly
used.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
our
point
is,
that
the
grand
jury
subpoena
is
used
in
this
matter
to
acquire
these
voluminous
records
from
banks,
invades
the
depositors
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
is
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
we
rely
on
katz,
the
language
in
katz,
and
also
as
to
the
proprietary
interest
in
the
documents
themselves,
we
also
cite
(inaudible)which
is
a
case
where
the
man
did
not
have
any
proprietary
interest
in
the
union
documents
that
were
secured
in
his
shared
office
space.
and
in
this
particular
instance
we
have
a
compulsory
record
keeping
of
everyone’s
financial
documents
and
papers
by
all
the
banks
in
the
nation.
we
have
a
situation
graphically
demonstrated
here
where
grand
jury
subpoenas
can
be
utilized
by
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms
agents
and
ostensibly
under
the
supervision
of
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
in
the
absence
of
a
grand
jury
and
in
the
absence
of
a
return
made
to
the
court
until
the
question
is
made.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
that.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
the
government
cannot,
in
this
instance,
as
the
government
concedes
they
were
looking
for
possible
transactions
relating
to
a
distillery.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
think
at
this
stage,
they
should
have
to
make
a
probable
cause
showing
just
to
get
these
files.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
they
can
develop
--
if
they
cannot
develop
probable
cause
they
should
not
intrude
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
honor,
mr.
justice
that
by
the
same
token,
approving
what
the
government
has
done
in
this
case
will
allow
them
in
an
unsupervised
manner
to
go
and
look
at
anyone’s
in
these
banks
at
anytime.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
but,
the
essential
difference
also
is
that
we
are
contending
today
that
these
records
should
be
allowed
the
same
dignity
as
the
original
records
that
were
at
home,
at
the
home
of
the
defendant.
they
could
not
have
secured
those
records
by
a
subpoena.
they
would
have
to
secured
a
search
warrant
for
mere
evidence
of
crime.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
i
realize
the
court’s
rulings
in
that
regard.
he
has
voluntarily
turned
him
over
to
a
third
party.
of
course
we
would
argue
here
that
this
is
--
actually
using
a
bank
is
a
necessity
of
human
life.
you
have
to
use
it.
the
case,
the
california
supreme
court
case
concedes
that.
i
realize
this
is
a
state
ruling,
but
i
cite
it
for
persuasive
authority
that
you
have
to
have
that
and
cases
cited
in
my
brief
indicate
that
depositors
themselves
have
a
right
of
privacy
and
contract
and
in
tort
that
they
can
enforce
in
this
regard.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
to
some
extent,
but
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
that
is
another
point
too.
that
is
really
not
the
need
of
the
grand
jury.
i
think
--
well
it
is
need
of
the
united
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
it
is
and
i
think
even
the
department
of
justice
in
a
statement
to
the
house
judiciary
committee
on
december
5,
1974,
has
indicated
that
the
traditional
functions
of
independence
of
grand
juries
is
really
a
myth.
this
is
a
letter
at
the
congressional
record
house,
page
11355
and
356
written
by
assistant
attorney
general
greg
straw
and
in
response
to
pending
legislation
regarding,
eliminating
grand
juries,
he
refers
to
the
independence
of
the
grand
juries
as
really
non
existent
anymore
as
a
practical
matter.
they
work
under
the
auspices
of
the
united
states
attorney’s
offices.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
in
behalf
of
the
depositors?
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
well,
but
that
would
be
an
investigation
relating
to
the
bank,
but
not
the
depositors.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
he
could
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
he
could
rely
--
he
could
start
by
relying
on
the
boyd
case
that
held
that
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendment
comes
together.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
mr.
justice,
i
have
to
admit
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
walling
case
so
i
do
not
think
i
could
really
respond
to
that,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
i
am
really
asking
so
far
the
fourth
amendment
to
individual
depositor’s
rights
in
that
of
which
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
as
i
indicate,
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
respond
because
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
walling
case,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
mr.
justice,
our
complaint
is
two-fold.
one,
as
a
composure
microfilming,
working
in
conjunction
with
grand
jury
subpoena
process,
if
this
honorable
court
will
recognize
a
right
of
a
constitutional
fourth
amendment
right
in
these
records
then
we
contend
that
grand
jury
subpoenas
and
grand
jury
process
does
nothing,
but
give
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
it
may
be
perfectly
alright,
if
these
records
are
indeed
not
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
our
contention
is
that
if
they
are
protected
under
fourth
amendment
grand
jury
procedures
just
simply
do
not
afford
any
protection
to
the
individual
depositor.
it
leaves
in
the
hands
of
the
agents
and
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
as
a
practical
matter,
the
securing
of
these
records
ostensibly
for
the
grand
jury
proceedings
which
even
in
this
record
does
not
show
whether
not
these
materials
leave
and
handed
over
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
from
a
pure
title
standpoint,
the
bank
owns
the
microfilm,
but
as
a
practical
matter
really,
they
are
not
looking
for
tangible
evidence.
they
are
looking
for
information
on
the
microfilm.
we
are
seeking
to
protect
the
information
on
the
microfilm
and
the
point
here
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
sir?
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes,
and
in
fact
the
california
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
contend
that
the
scope
was
too
broad
because
as
a
practical
matter
they
did
not.
the
government
argues
there
may
be
independent
sources
for
their
inquiry.
i
do
not
think
the
record
demonstrates
any
independent
knowledge
or
request
for
a
particular
check.
in
fact,
in
both
instances,
in
one
instance
they
microfilm
everything
and
put
it
in
a
bag,
and
in
the
other
instance
they
sit
down
at
the
machine
with
the
young
lady
and
look
at
everything
and
not
only
just
this
dependent,
they
look
at
everyone
else.
perhaps
look
at
everyone
else
on
the
whole
microfilm.
but
as
to
the
independent
source,
argument
by
the
government
we
contend
is
not
even
is
not
even
demonstrated
by
the
record
in
this
case.
it
is
graphically
demonstrated
that
the
agents
did
not
know
anything
about
any
particular
transactions.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
we
would
mr.
justice
because
c&s
bank
of
warner
robins
used
limited
microfilming
procedures
for
example
and
in
that
particular
instance,
there
would
have
been
no
records.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
have
to
maintain
some
records
that
they
feel
is
necessary
for
their
operation.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
certainly
do
not
want
to
concede
that
the
subpoena
in
the
matter
in
which
it
was
handled
a
would
have
been
alright.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
have
probably
rely
it
again
on
the
california
courts
rulings
and
not
only
in
that
case
where
that
was
an
instance
where
the
police
officer
requested
just
the
statements,
the
man’s
statements,
they
did
not
get
any
check
and
they
held
it
under
their
constitutional
provisions,
he
had
a
right
to
privacy
that
was
protected.
and
also
they
have
held
that
the
compulsory
financial
statements
required
of
public
officials
violates
an
individual’s
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
his
financial
affairs.
and
i
would
note
in
closing
that
as
we
have
indicated
in
brief
there
are
state
cases
where
the
depositors
have
enforced
their
contractual
and
tort
right
to
privacy
as
to
the
rights
of
depositors
for
unreasonable
--
disclosing
these
materials.
i
would
also
cite
a
case
that
i
do
not
have
in
brief.
it
is
a
third
circuit
case
zimmermann
v.
wilson,
81
f.2d
847
(3d
cir.
1936).
this
case
was
somewhat
modified
at
a
later
date,
but
if
indeed
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
as
to
these
records
on
the
part
of
bank
depositors,
i
believe
the
language
in
this
case
where
in
fact,
they
note
as
even
in
the
old
case
of
entick
versus
carrington,
that
really
is
not
the
paper,
it
is
the
information
on
the
paper
that
is
sought
to
be
protected.
and
we
contend
here
that
the
interaction,
the
compulsory
recording
of
all
these
records
by
the
banks
under
the
bank
secrecy
act
with
the
interaction
of
these
subpoenas
does
indeed
invade
an
area
where
depositors
reasonably
and
justifiably
can
and
should
be
protected.
if
one
cannot
keep
his
own
financial
affairs
out
of
the
scrutiny
of
the
government,
except
with
some
type
of
probable
cause
showing
we
would
at
least
argue
that
it
is
certainly
his
right
to
privacy
has
been
diminished
in
a
great
extent
and
even
our
constitution
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
no
sir.
my
client
did
not
know
about
the
act
itself.
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
well,
he
had
never
indicated
any
knowledge
of
the
microfilm
recording,
mr.
justice,
until
well
after
the
fact.
we
did
not
know
about
it
until
after
it
was
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
i
knew
about
the
act,
yes
sir,
but
i
did
--
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
because
i
did
not
represent
him
at
the
time
of
these
subpoenas.
i
did
not
represent
him
until
march
when
he
was
--[laughter]
mr.
d.
l.
rampey,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
thank
you.
