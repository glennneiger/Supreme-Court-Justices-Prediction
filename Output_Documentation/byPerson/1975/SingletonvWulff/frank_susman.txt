mr.
frank
susman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
statute
as
it
came
out
in
oral
argument
during
the
appellate
hearing
it
was
clear
what
the
state
means
for
medical
reasons,
therapeutic
abortions,
only
those
abortions
which
were
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
for
health
were
to
be
reimbursed
under
the
statute.
mr.
frank
susman
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
the
hornbook
type
of
black
letter
law
is
clearly
that
issues
not
decided
below,
will
not
be
decided
on
appeal
and
yet
as
we
attempt
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are
exceptions
which
have
been
accepted
by
every
circuit
to
this
general
black
letter
rule.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
the
three-judge
federal
statutes
would
appear
to
give
the
jurisdiction
solely
to
the
three-judge
district
court
panel.
we
would—
mr.
frank
susman
right.
we
would
suggest
that
in
the
unusual
situation
that
occurred
here
that
once
the
matter
is
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
assuming
for
the
moment
that
it
is
a
clear
matter,
that
judicial
economy
and
the
administration
of
justice,
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
sending
it
back
the
very
purpose
of
the
three-judge
panel
so
that
one
single
judge
does
not
have
the
authority
in
which
to
set
aside
the
state
statue
has
certainly
not
been
obviated
in
this
case
because-
mr.
frank
susman
no,
there
certainly
was
not.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
it
was
not.
but
we
would
only
contend
that
the
purpose
of
the
three-judge
panel
not
to
give
that
type
of
power
to
one
judge
has
not
been
ignored
or
avoided
here
because
three
federal
judges
did
rule
on
the
issue.
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
in
this—
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
there
was
no
answer
filed
by
petitioner
in
this
case
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings,
although
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
several
other
cases
in
which
court
of
appeals
also
rule
on
the
merits
in
which
the
one
side
of
the
other,
the
defendants
below
at
least
had
never
filed
an
answer
because
filing
an
answer
could
in
no
way
contribute
it
to
the
case
because
the
issue
was
so
clear.
they
did
--
mr.
frank
susman
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
issue
a
judgment
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
frank
susman
in
the
last
if
this
is
maybe
consider
the
judgment
in
the
last
para
--
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
no
that
is
all
that
they
said
they
did
not—
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct,
they
did
not
issue
an
injunction.
mr.
frank
susman
it
was
difficult
to
find
cases
on
either
side
of
this
issue
on
the
second
point.
there
were
--
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
they
state
in
their
verified
complaint
that
they
do
have
patients,
they
have
not
refused
patients.
it
was
not
something
hypothetical.
they
also
filed
affidavits
to
the
exact
same
effect
that
the
petitioner
took
time
and
got
an
order
from
the
court
giving
him
additional
time
which
to
file
--
mr.
frank
susman
no,
that
is
not
all.
mr.
frank
susman
the
respondents
want
to
assert
their
patient's
right
to
equal
protection
under
the
laws
regard
to
that
if
the
state--
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
not
correct.
well,
that
is
all
the
only
remedy
of
this
particular
statute
would
be
funds
in
which
to
pay
right.
mr.
frank
susman
otherwise
they
would
be
denied
access
to
any
abortions.
mr.
frank
susman
right.
the
public
hospitals
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
presently
do
not
provide
procedures.
mr.
frank
susman
who
--
the
doctors?
yes
they
have
already
submitted
hundreds
of
applications
which
all
had
been
denied.
now
one
payment
was
made
in
the
year-and-half
between
the
time,
the
statute
was
enacted--
mr.
frank
susman
to
assert
their
patients
right,
constitutional
rights
to
free
--
mr.
frank
susman
to
pay
them
and
they
have
free
access
to
abortion
rather
than
have
to
rely
on
the
physician’s
charity
to
perform
it
with
out
any
compensation
because
there
is
no
other
source
or
avenue
for
them
to
obtain
these
procedures.
if
the
physicians
would
not
do
it
for
free
there
is
no
place
else
they
can
obtain
it.
mr.
frank
susman
i
apologize
that
i
do
not
have
a
copy.
except
you
are
reading,
i
do
not
have
a
copy
that
--
mr.
frank
susman
yes.
mr.
frank
susman
when
standing
became
an
issue
we
also
asserted
or
attempted
to
assert
in
the
appeal
that
they
had
the
right
to
assert
their
patient's
constitutional
rights
to
abortion
as
part
of
their
standing.
they
have
standing
not
only
in
their
own
rights
but
on
behalf
of
their
patients.\
those
--
mr.
frank
susman
yes.
mr.
frank
susman
yes.
mr.
frank
susman
certainly.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
there
it
is
a
line
of
cases
in
which
individuals
whether
physicians
or
otherwise
have
a
right
of
liberty
to
pursue
a
lawful
profession
and
to
earn
a
living.
i
think
doctors
have
a
particular
right.
well,
of
course
part
of
it,
but
it
is
very
hard
to
separate,
that
is
one
of
standing
arguments
that
the
confidential
relationship
between
the
physician
and
a
woman
in
regard
to
abortion
procedure
is
basically
inseparable
and
is
very
hard
to
distinguish
and
segregate
out
the
respective
rights
of
each
because
this
it
is
a
joint
decision
under
the
wording
roe
and
doe.
the
abortion
cases,
ignore
for
the
moment
all
those
cases
which
provide
criminal
penalties,
all
statute
adopted
subsequent
to
1973,
in
every
one
of
those
cases
even
the
ones
that
had
no
criminal
penalties,
doctors
were
held
to
have
standing
to
assert
their
own
rights
and
those
of
their
patient.
in
other
medicaid
context
other
than
abortion
doctors
and
the
providers
of
medical
services,
institutions,
hospitals,
nursing
homes,
have
all
been
consistently
held
to
have
standing
to
assert
the
right
to
medicaid
payments
on
behalf
of
the
people
that
they
treated.
petitioner
cited
not
a
single
case,
abortion
or
medicaid
nature
in
which
physicians
were
not
held
to
have
standing
to
assert
these
type
of
payments
rights
on
behalf
of
their
patients.
mr.
frank
susman
he
may
have
any
constitutional
right,
i
think
he
has
other
interest.
the
court
of
appeals
for
example
made
specific
holding
that
in
two
ways,
1,
this
type
of
statute
which
excluded
payments
for
abortion
--
number
one
it
fringed
upon
his
medical
practice.
and
number
two,
caused
him
economic
hardship,
and
both
of
those
factors,
they
considered
to
give
him
separate
standing,
each
independently
was
enough
to
give
him
standing
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
financial
detriment
that
he
experienced,
and
also
the
fact
that
his
right
to
practice
medicine
was
being
fringed
upon.
mr.
frank
susman
separate
and
apart
from
their
patient,
i
am
not
sure
that
they
have
any
right
to
relief
on
a
constitutional
basis.
mr.
frank
susman
only
in
one
way
did
they
have
an
opportunity
to
deny
them,
because
all
of
those
allegations
that
you
referred
to
in
the
complaint
were
repeated
in
affidavits
filed
by
the
respondents
and
the
petitioners
specifically
requested
an
opportunity
from
the
court
to
file
counter
affidavits
and
was
given
leave
to
do
so
and
never
chose
not
to.
mr.
frank
susman
page
40,
i
am
sorry?
mr.
frank
susman
there
was
a
motion,
as
i
recall
a
motion
of
summary
judgment
filed
by
the
respondents.
although
i
really
do
not
recall
the
affidavits
have
been
filed
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
opposed
to
being
in
support
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
they
were
--
mr.
frank
susman
your
honor,
i
do
not
recall
whether
or
not
there
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
filed
this
time.
from
the
look
at
the
chronological
list
of
countries,
it
would
appear
that
there
was
not.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
as
to
standing
we
feel,
again
we
indicated
that
petitioner
has
not
cited
a
single
case
dealing
either
with
abortion
or
medicaid
in
which
physicians
were
not
held
to
have
standing
on
behalf
of
their
patient's
rights.
they
are
numerous
cases
in
which
they
were
held
as
have
such
standing
and
many
of
these
are
in
no
way
analogous
to
doe
versus
bolton
because
there
are
not
in
criminal
context.
there
are
also
some
--
mr.
frank
susman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
statement
does
appear
both
in
complaints
and
in
the
affidavits.
mr.
frank
susman
yes.
mr.
frank
susman
in
paragraph
9,
both
affidavits
being
identical
in
paragraph
9
on
page
32
of
the
appendix,
the
affidavit
by
respondent
george
j.l.
wulff
jr.
he
states
that
he
has
provided
an
anticipate
providing
abortions
in
the
future,
that
he
has
been
refused
and
anticipate
future
refusals
for
payment.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
it
would
not
adversely
affect
those
patients
upon
whom
he
had
to
date
rendered
services,
except
that
he
may
well
have
a
private
contract
right
back
against
them
for
payment.
i
admit
that
it
would
have
greater
effect
upon
the
future
patients.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
believe
there
is.
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
not
a
specific
allegation
to
that
effect.
i
think
perhaps
common
sense
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
the
doctors
will
not
continue
to
providing
the
services
for
free.
i
think
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact,
the
public
hospitals
are
not
doing
--.
mr.
frank
susman
i
agree.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
the
respondent
have
that
burden.
i
think
the
doctors,
the
physicians
have
standing
not
only
on
their
own
rights
as
we
previously
indicated
but
also
on
behalf
of
their
patients
both
the
right
to
practice
medicine
which
several
lower
courts
have
held,
both
the
economic
interest
which
we
have
already
discussed.
we
also
believed
that
they
have
the
logical
nexus
which
is
necessary.
we
think
the
general
rule
as
far
as
deciding
a
question
on
appeal
which
has
not
been
decided
below
is
basically
that
an
appellate
court
does
not
lack
of
power
to
do
what
plainly
ought
to
be
done
and
that
the
appellate
courts
decision
to
consider
the
merits
of
a
case
upon
appeal,
although
not
decided
below
is
matter
of
judicial
discretion
and
is
not
really
a
limit
on
jurisdictional
power.
basically,
that
was
the
whole
in
mercury
motor
express.
in
the
recent
decision
out
of
the
seven
circuit
authored
by
justice
stevens
in
fitzgerald
versus
porter
memorial
hospital,
in
that
case
a
single
judge
dismissed
for
lack
of
standing
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
went
on.
in
that
case
there
was
even
a
dissent
and
so
the
issue
was
not
even
as
clear
as
perhaps,
it
should
be
regarded
in
this
case.
but
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
rule
in
constitutional
merits.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
was
not
below.
the
factors
to
be
considered
as
found
but
the
various
circuits--
mr.
frank
susman
i
would
think
that
if
both
of
the
issues
are
affirmed
as
far
as
the
merits,
this
particular
case
is
over.
it
may
not
be
binding
on
other
future
litigation
in
other
states
as
far
as
this
particular
litigation
and
as
it
applies
to
missouri,
the
issue
would
be
resolved.
it
would
be
a
final
judgment.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct
but
i
am
assuming
justice
brennan
remarks
that
both
issues
were
to
be
affirmed
right.
the
factors
of
the
various
circuits
have
looked
at,
we
suggest
as
to
when
an
appellate
court
should
rule
on
the
merits
when
the
issue
has
not
been
decided
below
are
all
present
here.
they
include
some
of
the
following;
the
summary
judgment
nature
of
the
proceedings
--
petitioners
never
chose
to
contest
and
ignoring
for
the
moment
of
whether
or
not
he
had
the
opportunity
to
file
an
answer.
he
never
chose
to
contest
that
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeal
in
his
brief
or
any
of
the
factual
contexts
that
--
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct
you
honor.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
by
the
district
court.
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think,
the
answer
to
that
was
not
all
it
was
the
before
court
of
appeals
is
because
respondents
moved
their
own
initiative
to
attempt
in
every
way
possible
to
bring
the
merits
before
the
court
of
appeals
both
in
their
brief
and
then
oral
argument
which
they
did
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
either
rightly
or
wrongly
of
course
is
for
the
court
to
decide
but
they
did
accept.
certainly
counsel
for
petitioner
and
petitioner
were
forewarned
that
the
merits
were
going
to
be,
there
was
going
to
be
every
effort
to
contest
them
and
to
argue
on
appeal
some
80%
or
90%
of
the
appellant's
brief
constituted
the
merits--
mr.
frank
susman
that
was
the
only
ruling
by
the
district
court.
mr.
frank
susman
we
would
argue
that
was
not
all
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
am
not
in
position
to
say
whether
the
court
of
appeals
acted
correctly
or
not
but
certainly
the
respondents
made
every
effort
to
bring
the
merits
before
them,
and
for
the
various
reasons
and
we
think
the
reasons
that
other
circuits
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing
in
like
cases,
chose
in
this
particular
case
to
exercise
their
discretion
which
we
believe
they
had
and
to
rule
on
the
merits.
mr.
frank
susman
certainly.
mr.
frank
susman
no
there
are
not,
we
could
not
find
any
cases
on
either
side
on
those
specific
facts
as
you
set
them
forth?
mr.
frank
susman
sixth
circuit
was
asked
to
do
basically
the
same
thing.
mr.
frank
susman
they
did,
they
sent
it
back
to
the
panel
for
determination
of
the
constitutional
merits.
but
we
would
suggest
that
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeal
decides
to
send
it
back
or
to
retain
it
and
decide
it
on
their
own
initiative
is
matter
of
discretion
to
be
exercised
and
the
fact
that
the
sixth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit
reached
opposite
conclusions
as
to
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
in
no
manner
speaks
that
there
was
an
abusive
discretion
by
either
circuit.
and
that
the
test
to
be
utilized
here
is
whether
or
not
they
abused
their
discretion
in
ruling
upon
the
merits.
mr.
frank
susman
i
am
not
quite
sure,
i
have
not
seen
all
the
commentaries
and
text
and
other
cases
in
which
issues
are
decided
which
were
not
decided
below.
i
have
never
seen
a
discussion
as
to
which
classification
this
might
fall
in.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
clearly,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
letter
of
the
three-judge
panel
law.
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
because
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
remove
from
a
single
judge
the
power
to
set
aside
state
legislation.
and
here
three
judges
have
the
opportunity
to
rule.
mr.
frank
susman
just
a
moment,
your
honor,
sixth
circuit
is
roe
versus
ferguson

fed

mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
1970.
mr.
frank
susman
we
certainly
urged
upon
them
to
do
it.
i
cannot
say
that
we
were
not
surprised.
we
were
presently
surprised.
mr.
frank
susman
was
there
opposition
to?
mr.
frank
susman
i
cannot
really
recall
on
oral
whether
or
not
and
counsel
for
petitioner
have
to
speak
for
himself.
but
again,
we
would
take
the
position
that
because
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
our
brief
was
filed
first
and
dealt
almost
exclusively
with
the
merits.
our
oral
argument
dealt
almost
exclusively
with
the
merits,
that
in
effect
petitioner
had
his
chance
to
stand
up
and
take
his
wings,
he
had
his
chance
at
that
--
he
chose-
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
certainly
a
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
the
only
reasons
we
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
with
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
eighth
circuit
did
is
that
if
one
examines
the
different
reasons
of
justification,
and
again,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
no
case
exactly
on
constitutional
issues
has
been
done
but
in
other
areas
where
they
have
ruled
on
the
issue
clearly
not
decided
below.
in
fact,
the
only
issue
constitutionally
perhaps
is
fitzgerald
case
itself,
but
if
you
look
at
the
justifications,
the
reasons
they
say
why
we
are
going
to
ahead
and
rule
on
the
merits,
but
rule
on
an
issue
not
decided
below
and
there
are
many
summary
judgment
nature
of
the
proceedings,
the
clarity
to
principle,
the
fact
that
it
affects
a
lot
of
people
and
all
the
recognized
exceptions
--
every
one
of
those
we
would
argue
applies
to
this
case.unk
mr.
frank
susman
certainly
for
consistency,
if
not
for
any
other
reason,
i
would
agree
that
they
would
have
that
authority
in
a
given
case
which
fit
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
of
the
type
of
case
that
ought
to
be
decided
on
that
basis.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
exactly
true
because
in
fact—
mr.
frank
susman
right.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
that
is
not
exactly
correct.
prior
to
this
decision
which
came
down
in
december
31
of
1974,
some
15
other
federal
judges
had
passed
on
the
identical
issue
of
whether
excluding
abortion
from
medicaid
payments,
denial
of
equal
protection.
since
the
decision
of
december
31,
1974
and
this
of
course
is
only
in
retrospect,
an
additional
11
judges
have
so
held.
and
this
is
also
--
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
no
not
all
outside
some
of
those.
mr.
frank
susman
some
of
15
where
within
the
eighth
circuit,
some.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
none.
mr.
frank
susman
in
addition
to
those
15
judges
who
had
ruled
on
the
exact
equal
protection
argument
of
the
medicaid
exclusion,
there
was
also
a
host
of
other
federal
judges
who
would
rule
on
the
exact
equal
protection
argument
in
the
public
hospital
context
and
we
would
submit
that
there
can
be
distinction
between
the
two
because
the
same
argument
is
that
if
a
public
hospital
or
at
the
state
through
medicaid
provides
maternity
services
and
the
right
of
equal
protection
means
they
must
also
provide
abortion
services.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
they
were
urged
by
appellants,
respondents
to
do
so
quite
clearly.
mr.
frank
susman
while
i
agree
with
that
argument,
i
do
not
think
that
that
statement
is
synonymous
with
situations
under
which
a
court
of
appeals
can
rule
upon
an
issue
not
decided
below.
i
think
this
is
case
where
they
could
not
rule.
but
those
to—
mr.
frank
susman
that
and
i
think
there
are
two
other
ways
to
get
out.
first
being
the
fact
that
the
intent
and
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
three
judge
court
has
not
been
obviated
here
because
three
federal
judges
did
in
fact
--.
mr.
frank
susman
the
second
possible
way
out
would
be
that
in
light
of
staple
that
the
appellants,
respondents
did
not
appeal
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief
and
therefore
have
waived
the
request
for
injunctive
relief
and
therefore
even
if
necessary
remand,
it
may
well
now
go
back
in
absence
of
any
request
for
injunctive
relief
to
a
single
district
judge.
so,
i
offer
you
three
possibilities,
i
think
i
will
stop.
thank
your
honor.
