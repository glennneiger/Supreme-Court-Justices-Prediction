chief

the
court

chief

warren
e.

i
beg
your
pardon.
chief

when

to
the
district
court,
it
went
to
a
three-judge
court,
did

and
then
what
did
the

essentially
the
same
as
the
action

took
on
the
constitutional
question
which
the
district

did
not
reach?

warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
think
their
proper
procedure
should
have
been
on
that
issue,
if
they
were
going
to
be
decided
to
send
it
back
to
the
three-judge

to
reach
constitutional
issue?

panel?
chief

a
de
facto
of
three-judge
district
court,
was
it?
chief

e.

is
all
about.
chief

warren
e.
burger
the
district
court
statute

had
a
right
to
think
that
you
had
no
business
to
brief
that
issue
and
thought
that
the
three
judges
on

that
too?
