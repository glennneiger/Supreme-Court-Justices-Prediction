mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
on
for
hearing
upon
the
grant
by
the
court
of
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
limited
to
two
specific
questions.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
respondents
who
are
two
st.
louis
physicians
licensed
to
practice
medicine
in
missouri
has
standing
to
challenge
in
federal
courts,
the
constitutionally
of
the
missouri
state
statute
which
provides
that
benefit
payment
maybe
made
to
eligible
needy
persons
for
medical
assistance,
including
medical
assistance
for
family
planning
services
but
that
such
family
planning
services
shall
not
include
abortions
unless
same
are
medically
indicated.
the
second
issue
over
which
the
court
has
accepted
the
certiorari
is
whether
the
eighth
circuit
had
jurisdiction
to
take
under
consideration
and
determine
the
constitutionally
of
a
state
statute
on
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
dismissing
a
complaint
for
lack
of
standing.
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
eastern
district
of
missouri
dismissed
count
two,
which
we
are
now
concerned
with
the
other
two
counts
not
having
been
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
respondents
complaint
on
the
basis
that
although
the
issue
itself
may
have
been
judicable,
the
two
physicians
who
brought
the
law
suit
were
not
the
proper
parties
to
allege
in
federal
courts
that
this
particular
statute
was
unconstitutional.
this
order
granting
the
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
was
appealed
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
eighth
circuit
court
found,
first
that
the
district
court
was
incorrect
in
its
decision
on
standing
and
reversed
the
action
of
the
district
court
in
finding
that
these
two
physicians
do
not
have
standing.
but
the
court
below
did
not
stop
at
that
point,
the
court
went
on
to
the
determine
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
respondent's
constitutional
claims
on
the
basis
of
the
state
statute
challenge
was
so
obviously
constitutional
is
not
to
require
remand.
after
the
court
then
took
up
the
constitutional
merits
of
the
original
complaint,
the
lower
court
ruled
that
this
particular
statute
was
especially
unconstitutional
to
the
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
count
two
with
which
we
are
concerned
which,
the
plaintiff's
complaint
which
was
filed
in
the
eastern
district
court
of
missouri
included
all
necessary
allegations
in
order
to
invoke
a
three-judge
district
court
statute
passed
by
congress.
the
allegation
was
that
the
language
in
missouri
statute,
that
medical
benefit
payments
will
not
be
made
else,
only
the
needy
persons
for
family
planning
services
for
abortions
unless
such
abortions
are
medically
indicated
was
unconstitutional.
respondents
purported
to
bring
their
action
on
their
own
behalf
and
on
the
behalf
of
the
entire
class
of
duly
licensed
physicians
in
missouri,
presently
performing
or
desiring
to
perform
abortions
upon
women,
minors
and
adults
were
eligible
for
missouri
state
medicaid
assistants.
in
response
to
the
complaint,
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
among
other
things
raised
the
point
that
the
respondent
physicians
did
not
have
sufficient
standing
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionally
of
this
particular
statute.
the
only
factual
matters
which
went
on
the
record
before
the
district
court
ruled
on
that
motion
to
dismiss
was
a
limited
number
of
answers
to
interrogatories
by
the
petitioner
in
which
he
noted
that
he
knew
no
official
interpretation
to
the
challenged
language
and
that
no
medically
indicated
abortion
payments
had
been
made
over
a
period
of
three
months.
an
affidavits
of
the
doctors
attached
to
their
suggestions
and
our
position
to
our
motion
to
dismiss,
to
the
effect
that
they
were
unsure
as
to
what
the
statutory
language
met,
how
it
would
be
interpreted,
that
this
uncertainty
as
to
its
interpretation
chilled
their
ability
to
practice
medicine
as
the
they
deemed
most
expertise.
this
was
the
entire
record
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
standing.
and
that
was
the
entire
record
that
went
to
eighth
circuit
when
the
respondent
doctors
in
this
case
chose
to
appeal
that
order.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
as
i
understand
the
system,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
patient
makes
application
for
the
medicaid
benefit
payments,
since
that
in
to
the
state.
the
state
then
on
behalf
of
the
patient
sends
the
money
itself
directly
to
the
treating
physician.
at
the
time
that
the
eighth
circuit
took
up
this
matter
on
appeal,
petitioner
had
never
filed
an
answer.
no
meaningful
discovery
had
been
conducted
by
their
party.
the
record
before
the
eighth
circuit
pertaining
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
consisted
solely
of
conclusary
allegations
included
in
the
original
complaint
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
had
not
conducted
a
hearing
into
the
constitutionally
of
the
statute
and
had
made
absolutely
no
pronouncement
as
to
its
beliefs
concerning
the
statute's
constitutional
merits.
in
addition,
the
petitioners
never
had
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
to
brief
or
to
argue
the
constitutional
claims
included
in
original
complaint.
nevertheless,
the
court
below
not
only
reversed
on
the
issue
of
standing,
they
went
on
to
find
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
hold
that
the
statute
was
facially
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
in
the
eighth
circuit,
your
honor,
the
petitioner
did
not
brief
or
discuss
the
merits
below,
believing
that
it
was
appealed
solely
from
an
order
dismissing
for
lack
of
standing.
the
respondents
did
brief
rather
extensively
whether
or
not
the
statute
was
constitutional
or
not.
again,
it
will
be
our
point
that
their
brief
and
argument
concerning
that
matter
was
not
responsive
to
the
purposes
of
the
appeal.
that
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
order
dismissing
for
lack
of
standing
not
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
when
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
we
certainly
got
their
brief
first
and
they
did
brief
the
constitutionality
of
statute.
however
as
i
said,
we
did
not
feel
that
was
responsive
to
the
notice
of
appeal
itself
or
to
what
the
district
court
did.
if
the
court
should
agree
on
appeal
with
the
district
court
that
these
physicians
do
not
have
sufficient
standing
to
adjudicate
this
matter,
it
will
not
be
necessary
in
my
opinion
for
the
court
to
reach
the
second
issue.
the
respondents
in
effect
will
be
out
of
the
court
in
any
consideration
as
to
merits
will
be
then
be
moot.
in
regard
to
standing
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
in
an
abstract
sense,
whether
section
208.152
(12)
the
revised
statute
to
missouri
is
or
is
not
unconstitutional
or
whether
the
issue
of
this
constitutionally
is
judicable
question
again
in
an
abstract
sense.
rather
it
is
necessary
that
the
respondent
physicians
allege
and
have
support
in
the
record
before
the
court
that
they
are
proper
parties
to
litigate
in
the
federal
courts,
this
constitutional
claim.
the
only
personal
interest
which
i
believe
the
respondents
can
claim
is
the
existence
of
some
degree
of
confusion
as
to
the
source
of
payments
for
abortions
performed
on
the
specific
class
of
present
and
perspective
patients.
and
if
the
respondents
even
with
the
best
of
intentions
are
expressing
only
their
moral
indignation
at
the
statute
or
if
they
are
trying
to
represent
the
interest
of
pregnant
welfare
women
who
they
feel
are
being
discriminated
against
by
the
statute,
even
at
their
perspective
patients,
that
is
not
enough
for
them
to
have
standing
to
use
the
federal
tribunals
and
to
take
up
the
dockets
of
the
federal
court
to
adjudicate
this
issue
about
which
they
have
no
personal
interest.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
federal
court
should
become
a
form
for
morally
righteous
crusade.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
the
actual
claim
in
their
complaint,
your
honor,
was
that
they
did
not
know
what
the
interpretation
of
the
section
was
and
therefore
they
were
deterred
in
the
practice
of
medicine
not
knowing
whether
they
may
or
they
may
not
paid
by
state
of
missouri
for
abortions
performed
on
eligible
welfare
recipients.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
certainly,
the
inference
is
made
in
their
complaint
that
they
would
be
ultimate
source
of
welfare
moneys
paid
out
by
the
state
of
missouri
but
for
the
existence
of
the
statute.
however,
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
they
might
be
the
ultimate
recipient
of
medicaid
moneys
paid
by
the
state
of
missouri
i
still
think
that
the
traditional
standing
requirements
arising
out
of
article
3
of
federal
constitution
requires
that
they
be
able
to
show
a
personal
and
direct
detriment
which
arises
out
of
alleged
unconstitutionality.
now,
any
monetary
detriment
to
the
respondent
physicians
in
this
case
is
indirect.
it
does
not
arise
out
of
any
alleged
unconstitutionality.
it
arises
out
of
the
perspective
decisions
by
patients
and
perspective
patients
regarding
abortions,
whose
decision
on
behalf
of
the
patients,
may
or
may
not
be
affected
by
the
existence
of
the
statute.
in
other
words
if
this
statute
is
to
be
attacked
on
the
grounds
of
its
unconstitutionality
and
if
the
federal
courts
ought
to
accept
that
attack
as
a
judicable
question
and
consider
it,
the
proper
parties
to
adjudicate
the
matter
are
not
the
respondent
physicians
but
rather
they
are
the
pregnant
women
who
are
most
directly
affected
by
the
conjecture
operation
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
is
obvious
from
a
reading
of
the
multitude
of
cases
cited
on
both
briefs
that
pregnant
woman
have
certainly
been
able
to
participate
in
the
federal
court
process
involving
abortion
litigation.
i
think
it
is
even
more
apparent
that
they
are
protected
in
this
participation
by
the
use
of
such
names
as
roe
and
doe
which
would
protect
them
from
any
embarrassment
arising
out
of
their
supporting
their
constitutional
right
to
an
abortion.
i
think
that
given
the
protection
of
this
court
has
found
that
it
can
give
to
the
unanimity
for
women
desiring
to
participate
an
abortion
litigation
certainly
unnecessary
for
the
federal
court
to
entertain
litigation
which
is
brought
by
persons
not
within
the
direct
personal
causation
line
of
the
statute
and
constitutional
provisions
concerned
in
what
they
desire
that
had
to
be
done.
in
roe
and
doe
the
court
determined
that
the
constitutional
right
to
privacy
was
broad
enough
to
encompass
a
woman’s
decision
whether
or
not
to
terminate
her
pregnancy,
unless
the
woman’s
right
to
privacy
that
is
protected
by
constitution,
but
certainly
she
could
consult
with
the
physician
to
assist
her
in
exercising
her
decision
making
process.
but
is
still
her
right
which
is
protected
by
the
constitutional
her
privacy.
to
be
sure
in
doe
versus
bolton,
physicians
were
found
to
have
standing
to
participate
in
the
litigation
but
not
on
the
basis
of
constitutional
right
to
privacy
rather
on
the
basis
that
they
were
to
suffer
direct
personal
detriment
from
the
existence
of
statutes
under
which
they
could
be
criminally
prosecuted
in
the
state
courts
of
georgia.
the
challenged
missouri
statute
does
not
subject
the
physician
respondents
to
any
criminal
prosecution.
the
status
of
respondents
is
more
closely
akin
i
believe
to
the
childless
married
couple
in
roe
versus
wade
who
asserted
that
if
the
wife
became
pregnant
in
the
future,
they
would
desire
an
abortion—like
that
childless
married
couple,
the
respondent
may
choose
to
perform
abortions
on
legit
women.
and
those
women,
if
eligible,
may
choose
to
apply
for
medical
assistance
as
a
means
for
providing
the
respondents
a
pay.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
well
that
will
up
to
the
people
who
are
pushing
a
particular
legislation
or
i
think
it
is
likely
that
they
will
seek
out
plaintiffs
who
are
proper
parties
to
litigate
the
constitutionality
of
the
statue.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
well,
for
one
thing
what
we
really
want
to
gain,
that
comes
up
on
the
second
issue
we
want
to
have
hearing
on
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
secondly
we
do
not
think
that
the
state
of
missouri
or
officials
of
the
state
of
missouri
should
be
subjected
in
the
federal
courts
to
crusading
type
law
suits
like
this
one
is.
it
is
a
matter
or
not
only
of
gaining
in
this
case
but
it
gaining
in
the
future--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
well,
crusading
to--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
to
that
extent
your
honor
but
if
the
state
is
to
be
and
we
are
constantly
subjected
to
law
suits
in
order
to
keep
this
to
a
reasonable
minimum,
i
think
that
the
federal
court
should
require
that
the
people
bring
those
law
suits,
satisfy
the
traditional
standing
requirements
of
article
3
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
well,
again
your
honor,
it
probably
not
as
much
of
existence
of
what
we
gain
in
this
particular
case,
is
that
the
principle
that
stands
for
that
if
the
state
is
to
be
sued
in
federal
courts,
the
proper
parties
only
would
be
ones
who
would
be
entertained.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
counts
one
and
three
were
also
dismissed
but
were
are
not
appealed.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
not
the
defendant
with
regard
the
counts
one
and
three.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
they
were
dismissed
on
other
grounds,
lack
of
case
or
controversy
in
both
cases.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
both
federal
medicaid
laws
in
missouri
state
statutes
are
designed
to
afford
optimum
relief
to
eligible
persons
whose
applications
for
medicaid
assistance
is
denied
or
is
agreed
or
whose
interest
in
their
application
of
medicaid’s
assistance
are
agreed
in
that
interest
because
the
statutory
framework
provides
that
they
have
a
right
to
seek
a
hearing,
specifically
provides
that.
and
that
if
they
are
not
satisfied
with
that
hearing,
they
have
a
specific
right
to
appeal
to
the
appropriate
court.
the
physicians
are
not
in
any
way
in
the
federal
medicaid
laws
earn
the
state
statutes
which
enforce
medicaid
laws
in
missouri.
physicians
are
not
covered,
they
are
not
covered
in
any
manner,
no
mention
is
made
that
their
right
to
participate
in
the
hearing
of
their
right
to
object
to
the
failure
of
an
application
for
medicaid
assistance
to
go
through.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
statutory
framework
which
congress
in
state
of
missouri
has
created
is
designed
on
behalf
of
poor
people.
it
logically
follows
that
the
welfare
recipient,
the
poor
person,
should
be
the
one
and
was
intended
by
congress
in
missouri
legislature
to
be
one
who
could
challenge
of
a
portion
of
that
statutory
framework
which
he
or
she
found
to
be
objectionable
or
which
he
or
she
believed
to
be
unconstitutional.
nor
do,
the
constitutional
provisions
under
which
respondents
claim
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
protect
the
interest
they
assert.
i
think
the
lack
of
standing
is
very
clear
unlike
the
second
portion
of
the
test
that
this
court
created
in
data
processing
in
barlow
cases.
i
do
not
believe
that
respondent
standing
cannot
be
made
just
to
stand
up
under
the
zone
of
interest
test.
in
the
first
place,
roe
and
doe
said
that
the
right
to
privacy
encompassed
the
woman’s
freedom
to
the
abortion
alternative
to
her
pregnancy.
certainly,
the
physician
who
performs
that
pregnancy
does
not
share
that
right
to
privacy.
he
may
consult
with
her
and
give
her
assistance
in
making
her
decision
but
the
constitutional
right
to
privacy
which
is
protected
of
roe
and
doe
cannot
be
said
to
extend
to
the
physician.
therefore,
i
do
not
think
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
can
maintain
that
they
are
within
the
zone
of
interest
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
and
the
right
of
privacy
it
includes.
a
court
below
when
reached
the
merits
found
that
this
statute
denied
equal
protection
clause
because
it
discriminated
against
women
who
chose
the
abortion
alternative
to
their
pregnancy.
if
in
fact
the
statute
does
constitute
invidious
discrimination
and
we
do
not
concede
that,
we
would
like
to
have
a
hearing.
the
people
discriminated
against
are
the
poor
women
who
want
to
have
an
abortion
rather
than
take
their
pregnancy
deterrent.
i
do
not
think
that
the
respondents
can
maintain
that
they
within
the
zone
of
interest
protected
by
the
equal
protection
in
clause
in
that
regard.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
clear
at
all
your
honor,
the
district
court
in
fact
impaneled
the
three-judge
court,
that
it
found
no
substantial
constitutional
question,
one
judge
could
have
taken
care
of
the
matter.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
if
the
judge
who
impaneled
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
would
not
have
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
excuse
me,
would
you
please
repeat
the
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
they
dismissed
for
lack
of
standing.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
under
gonzales,
it
certainly
was
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor,
of
course,
i
think
--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
three-judge
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
allegations
of
the
complaint.
i
think
that
--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
no,
i
am
not
giving
up
a
standing
point.
i
was
covering
the
standing
point
first
because
if
the
court
should
agree
with
me
on
standing
matter,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
consider
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
regard
to
reaching
the
merits.
i
think
that
question
does
not
make
a
good
transition
in
the
second
issue
which
is
pending
before
the
court
today
on
this
ground
of
certiorari.
to
say
the
least,
the
record
pending
before
the
eighth
circuit
was
a
very
limited
one
on
which
to
read
the
merits,
the
respondents
claim
that
this
particular
statute
was
unconstitutional.
the
case
had
never
reached
the
stage
in
which
the
three-judge
court,
before
the
three-judge
court,
in
which
there
is
the
petitioner
would
have
had
a
chance
to
defend
on
the
merits,
in
fact,
the
petitioner
never
would
have
an
opportunity
to
file
an
answer.
the
district
court
had
only
been
called
upon
to
rule
upon
the
procedural
matters
raised
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
and
it
had
never
considered
except
perhaps
reading
conclusary
allegations
in
the
complaint.
the
constitutional
question
concerned.
28
u.s.c.
1291
provides
that
the
court
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
from
all
final
decisions
of
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
well,
i
respectfully
submit
that
only
final
decision
before
the
eighth
circuit
was
one
dismissing
a
complaint
for
lack
of
standing
because
the
district
court
certainly
never
considered
anything
other
that
the
standing
of
decisions
with
respect
to
what
they
did
to
count
two
of
the
complaint.
when
the
eighth
circuit
determined
that
it
could
reach
the
merits
and
proceeded
to
do
so,
i
believe
that
it
began
to
exercise
original
jurisdiction
which
it
had
not
been
deferred
upon
it
by
congress.
furthermore,
the
complaint
which
raised
the
constitutional
issues
made
every
allegation
necessary
for
a
three-judge
district
court
to
be
impaneled
and
in
fact
the
complaint
specifically
requested
that
the
three-judge
district
court
be
impaneled.
congress
has
mandated
that
with
regard
to
such
complaints,
that
in
the
first
instance
they
be
considered
by
a
three-judge
district
court
with
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
as
matter,
now
stands
in
the
first
instance,
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
has
been
considered
only
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
certainly
i
can
see
nowhere
in
congressional
scheme
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
where
eighth
circuit
has
jurisdiction
to
step
in
into
the
matter
on
an
issue
like
standing
on
appeal
the
reach
a
decision
on
the
merits.
the
sixth
circuit
was
called
upon
to
do
the
same
thing
as
the
eighth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case
in
roe
versus
ferguson,
a
statute
which
is
extremely
similar
to
statute
we
are
concerned
here
and
again
the
three-judge
district
court
had
not
reached
the
question
of
the
statute’s
constitutionality.
sixth
circuit
considered
and
rejected
an
argument
in
that
case
that
the
constitutional
issue
involved,
if
that
is
constitutionality
of
the
statute
had
been
clearly
settled
or
resolved.
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
correctly
remanded
their
case
to
three-judge
district
court
so
that
--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
to
this
extent,
your
honor—
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
think
you
can
reach
that,
i
think
it
becomes
relevant
because
respondents
are
alleging
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
so
clear,
so
clearly
settled
by
the
federal
courts
that
there
is
no
reason.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor,
under
the
statutory
scheme
set
up
a
congress,
i
do
think
that
is
the
case.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
as
i
understood
the
statute
your
honor,
either
one
would
have
been
acceptable,
that
although
i
could
have
raised
the
certiorari
or
appeal
to
constitutional
questions
but
on
appeal,
i
could
not
have
raised
questions
who
are
not
of
a
constitutional
magnitude
and
other
questions
in
regard
to
standing
and
their
jurisdictional
writ
to
merits
that
i
was
not
sure
about
what
the
court
would
say
in
regard
to
the
recent
constitutional
magnitude.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
the
court
of
appeals
declared
a
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
no
your
honor
and
it
did
not--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
that
we
should
allow
the
court
of
appeals
merely
by
not
saying
in
it
is
opinion
we
hereby
enjoin
the
state
to
avoid
the
clear
legal
rule
that
they
have
only
appellate
jurisdiction
because
certainly
the
state
is
going
to
abide
by
a
ruling
in
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
they
certainly
did.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
and
i
do
not-
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
this
court
has
never
decided
and
had
not
decided
at
the
time,
the
eighth
circuit
rendered
its
opinion.
whether
a
state
must
provide
payments
to
indigents
for
non
therapeutic
abortions,
they
also
provide
pregnancy
payments
for
those
who
have
taken
the
term.
now—excuse
me,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
