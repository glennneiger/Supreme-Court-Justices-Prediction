justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
boicourt
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
the
payments
in
question
would
have
gone
to
the
patient
and
then
to
the
doctor
or
would
have
gone
directly
to
the
doctor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
are
you
under
some
notice
though
i
take
it
that,
since
they
were
the
appellant,
that
they
were
at
least
urging
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
before
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
the
doctors
not
make
any
claim
that
they
would
have
gotten
money
through
this
plan,
if
the
section
which
they
claim
was
unconstitutional,
were
stricken
and
that
they
did
not
get
the
money
without
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
they
were
to
be
paid,
they
would
have
done
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actually
if
you
had
sought
to
challenge
the
constitutional
ruling
of
court
of
appeals
you
would
have
come
here
by
appeal
and
not
by
certiorari,
would
you
not
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
really
the
effect
of
the
eighth
circuits
passing
on
the
constitutional
question
here
is
that
if
they
decided
adversely
to
the
state,
the
state
can
come
here
on
appeal
but
if
they
decided
in
favor
of
the
state,
the
original
plaintiffs
can
come
here
only
on
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frank
susman,
in
your
complaint,
you
alleged
that
your
clients
are
physicians
residing
and
engaged
in
practice
of
obstetrics
and
gynecology
and
so
forth.
now,
the
state,
i
take
it
never
had
an
opportunity
to
traverse
or
deny
those
allegations
because
of
the
fact
that
was
it
never
had
a
chance
to
file
in
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
read
the
district
court's
memorandum
of
may
31st,
i
thought
it
would
treat
it
as
a
motion
to
dismiss.
are
you
suggesting
there
was
in
fact
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
page
6,
page
40
of
the
10
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
sure
you
know
the
record
much
better
than
i
do,
i
was
just
reading
the
district
courtâ€™s
memorandum
of
may
31st?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
how
you
could
use
affidavits
to
oppose
a
motion
to
dismiss
where
you
are
trying
to
bring
in
fact
that
you
did
not
plead
in
your
complaint.
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
giving
the
defendant
the
chance
to
deny
the
material
allegations
which
really
go
to
standing
here
that
you
made
in
your
original
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
did
go
up
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
this
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
come
up
the
other
way,
it
seems
to
me,
you
very
likely
would
have
had
a
pretty
arguable
complaint,
at
that
point,
all
you
would
had
here
was
a
right
to
petition
for
certiorari
whereas
the
three-judge
district
court
had
decided
a
case,
you
would
have
had
a
right
of
direct
appeal
on
a
decision
here
on
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
does
twist
around
the
statutory
system
a
little
bit
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
pass
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
this
case
the
resident
judge
in
saint
louis,
the
convening
judge
had
refused
to
convene
a
three-judge
district
court
saying
the
issue
is
so
insubstantial,
i
would
not
even
hear
it.
and
you
would
then
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
goosby
against
osser
claim
that
it
was
substantial,
it
should
not
have
been
three-judge
court.
should
the
court
of
appeals
hearing
a
goosby
against
osser
contention
say,
well
not
only
this
is
substantial
but
we
know
the
answer
why
it
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court,
we
will
just
tell
him
answer
right
now,
it
is
not
constitution?
