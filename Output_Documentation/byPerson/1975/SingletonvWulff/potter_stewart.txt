stewart
it
is
in
the
appendix
and
then
your
theory
as
i
understood
the
complaint
was
that
there,
a,
they
would
not
get
and
b
their
ability
to
perform
these
services
for
people
on
welfare
is
chilled
because
they
do
know
whether
those
people
would
be
able
to
get
paid
so
it
affects
their
practice
rather
than
the
patients
--
that
is
what
the
complaint
seems
to
say,
your
argument
is
quite
different
here
though.
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
your
theory.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
whether
it
was
exercising
original
jurisdiction
or
appellate
jurisdiction,
it
was
doing
so
quite
inconsistently
with
the
three-judge
court
legislation
which
gives
jurisdiction
to
a
three-judge
federal
court
to
enjoin
a
state
statute
on
a
constitutional
basis.
it
gives
appellate
jurisdiction
to
this
court
to
review
that
constitutional
determination
and
the
one
court
to
which
it
does
not
give
either
original
or
appellate
jurisdiction
is
the
court
of
appeals,
is
not
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
citation
of
sixth
circuit
case?
justice

stewart
515,
279?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
