unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail
here
what
is
likely
to
happen,
to
be
back
and
start
all
over
again
with
proper
plan?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
gain
with
that
in
the
long
run?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
just
as
much
of
a
crusading
type
law
suit
if
you
have
a
female
patient
plaintiff
in
addition
to
the
doctors?
unknown
speaker
…or
that
accusation
for?
unknown
speaker
but
my
question
was
premised
on
the
event
of
you
prevailing
here.
i
just
wonder
what
you
are
hoping
to
gain
in
the
long
run?
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
you
to
pause
for
a
moment,
would
you
help
me
on
procedure
here
again
i
know
you
covered
it
i
am
a
little
bit
lost?
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
is
the
posture
counts
one
and
three?
unknown
speaker
were
not
appealed…
unknown
speaker
that
is
as
to
the
standing
question
there,
it
would
appear
to
have
been
standing
for
the
doctors
in
those
counts,
i
take
i
that
you
would
have--
unknown
speaker
i
see,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
under
limited
grant,
limited
the
question
one
and
two,
the
issue
of
the
correctness
of
the
constitutional
termination
is
before
us?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at,
may
we
reach
and
pass
upon
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
the
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
we
would
disagree
with
the
conclusion
on
the
constitutional
question.
you
suggest
we
cannot
express
that
disagreement,
we
would
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
three-judge
court
to
let
it
grapple
over
the
constitutional
question
first?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
frank
susman,
i
do
not
read
your
count
two
of
your
complaint
as
alleging
a
right
on
behalf
of
the
patients.
it
very
clearly
alleges
a
right
on
behalf
of
physicians
and
surgeons,
in
the
sense
what
it
says
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
constitutional
right
on
behalf
of
the
doctors?
unknown
speaker
you
do
in
your
complaint?
unknown
speaker
would
you
like
to
articulate
it?
unknown
speaker
the
constitutional
right
of
the
doctors
not
of
the
patients?
unknown
speaker
speaking
now
about
standing,
i
was
wondering
about
constitutional
rights
on
behalf
of
the
doctors?
what
constitutional
right
does
a
doctor
have
to
claim
entitlement
to
medical
fee
provided
by
the
state
to
people
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
their
own
fees
--
unknown
speaker
it
could
have
article
3
standing
to
stay
in
court,
and
i
was
addressing
my
inquiry
primarily
to
what
sort
of
relief
the
doctors
were
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
that
was
my
inquiry.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
susman,
your
reliance
on
the
patient's
rights
as
distinguished
with
the
reliance
on
the
physician's
economic
rights
is
i
do
not
find
any
allegation
either
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
affidavits
in
support
that
indicate
that
any
welfare
patients
was
ever
denied
an
abortion
by
any
of
your
clients.
unknown
speaker
and
one
and
three
would
respect
to
services,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
count
two.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
refusal
to
get
paid
deters
the
plaintiff
from
the
practice
of
medicine
in
the
manner
he
considers
to
be
the
most
expertise.
but
it
did
not
say
he
refuses
to
--
unknown
speaker
you
said
he
has
not
been
paid,
how
did
that
affect
his
patients?
as
i
understand
that,
he
has
been
doing
it
for
nothing?
unknown
speaker
but
how
that
adversely
affected
his
patients?
unknown
speaker
he
may
well
have
but
he
is
not
alleged
that
he
has,
he
did
not
say
so
in
his
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
limited
to
whatever
standing
you
have
as
a
doctor
who
says
i
want
to
do
a
lot
of
work
and
perhaps
i
would
not
get
pay
for
it
which
may
or
not
be
sufficient
but
i
really
do
not
see
your
claim
on
behalf
of
the
patients,
and
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
anywhere
alleged
that
any
patient,
on
welfare
ever
failed
to
get
an
abortion
when
needed.
unknown
speaker
can
rely
on
common
sense—
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
can
we
rely
on
common
sense
about
doctors
in
general
or
do
you
have
the
burden
of
saying
this
doctor
in
particular
is
able
to
assert
this
particularly.
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
three-judge
district
court
said?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
the
two
questions
as
to
what
certiorari
was
granted?
what
happens
to
the
judgment
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
that
is
because
we
limited
the
grant?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
you
mean
what
you
say
that
other
circuit
have
done
the
same
thing
in
like
cases.
there
are
no
any
other
precedents
for
the
court
of
appeals
deciding
a
constitutional
issue
which
should
normally
be
presented
in
the
first
instance
with
the
three-judge
district
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
was
a
case
opposing
your
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
eighth
circuit
--
unknown
speaker
--
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
exercising
appellate
jurisdiction
or
original
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
in
the
eighth
circuits’
opinion,
they
state
this
“we
are
urged
by
appellants,
that
would
be
your
side
of
the
case.
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
case
rather
than
remand
the
three-judge
court,
i
take
it
therefore,
you
were
not
surprised
as
counsel,
when
they
did
not
reach
the
merits?
do
you
think
it
would
be
important
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
was
there
our
position
at
that
time,
that
the
issue
had
not
been
passed
upon
by
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
yes,
when
you
were
arguing
before
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible),
is
it
not
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
going
to
imply--
is
that
implied
in
this
paragraph?
the
statute
in
question
is
obviously
unconstitutional
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
case
might
well
have
been
decided
by
one
federal
judge
accordingly
we
choose
to
make
final
determination.
unknown
speaker
--
either
single
judge
and
the
three
judges?
unknown
speaker
--
ever
passed
on
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
before
this?
unknown
speaker
--
within
missouri
and
eighth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
none
of
them.
it
might
well
have
happened
that
the
panel
you
caught
on
the
caa,
might
not
have
included
a
missouri
judge,
it
happen
that
you
did
catch
one
at
the
court
of
circuit
judge,
but
there
are
no
district
judge.
unknown
speaker
i
am
going
back
to
my
other
question,
i
take
it
then
that
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
do
this
in
entirely
sue
sponte?
unknown
speaker
as
to
restate
your
oral
argument
a
little
it
i
may,
your
point
really
is
that
the
defense
is
so
frivolous,
there
really
was
not
a
three-judge
court
cases
at
all.
that
it
could
have
been
appropriately
been
decided
by
a
single
judge
in
the
district
court
because
defense
is
frivolous,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
substantial--
unknown
speaker
but
the
way
you
get
out
of
the
three-judge
court
problem
is
by
saying
this
is
the
kind
of
issue
that
a
single
judge
could
have
decided
and
therefore
you
rely
on
this
analogy
of
other
court.
unknown
speaker
oh
that
is
a
different
argument.
the
first
argument,
bailey
against
patterson
situation?
that
is
right,
that
is
bailey
against
patterson
situation.
