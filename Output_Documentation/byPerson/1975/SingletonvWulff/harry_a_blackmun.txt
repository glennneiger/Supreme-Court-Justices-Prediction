justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
last
case
of
the
three
is
singleton
versus
wulff,
the
number
74-1393.
this
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
and
it
also
centers
in
the
state
of
missouri.
the
issue
here
however
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
missouri
statute
that
excludes
abortions
that
are
not
medically
indicated
for
the
purposes
for
which
medicaid
benefits
are
available
to
needy
persons.
the
plaintiffs
who
are
respondents
here
are
two
physicians
licensed
in
missouri
and
they
brought
this
action
for
injunctive
relief
and
a
declaration
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
defendant
is
the
chief
of
a
bureau
of
medical
services
of
missouri.
he
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
the
ground
among
others
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
have
standing
to
bring
it.
the
plaintiff
physicians
word
however
that
they
had
provided
abortions
to
needy
persons
and
intended
to
do
so
in
the
future.
and
that
they
were
financially
affected
and
affected
in
their
practice
by
the
statute.
the
three-judge
district
court
in
missouri
dismissed
the
complaint
for
lack
of
standing
and
appeal
was
taken
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
that
court
reversed
finding
that
the
respondents
did
have
standing
to
bring
the
action
and
having
decided
that
issue
the
court
went
on
to
consider
the
case
on
the
merits
held
that
the
missouri
statute
was
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
the
opinion
filed
today
we
hold
that
the
physicians
in
fact,
did
have
standing
to
maintain
the
suit.
we
feel
they
have
a
sufficiently
concrete
interest
in
the
outcome
to
make
it
a
case
or
controversy
subject
to
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
four
of
us,
a
minority
feel
that
the
respondent
physicians
also
are
proper
proponents
of
the
particular
rights
of
their
patients
on
which
in
part
they
base
their
suit.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
holds
that
the
court
of
appeal
should
not
have
proceeded
to
resolve
the
merits
of
the
case.
that
court
did
so
even
though
the
defendant
who
is
the
petitioner
here
had
not
yet
filed
an
answer
or
other
pleading
addressed
to
the
merits
and
did
not
had
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
or
legal
arguments
in
defense
of
the
statute.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
with
directions
that
it
be
returned
to
the
district
court.
so
that
the
petition
may
file
an
answer,
petitioner
may
file
an
answer
to
the
complaint
and
the
litigation
proceed
accordingly
in
normal
course.
