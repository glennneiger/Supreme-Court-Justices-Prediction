(inaudible)
it
did
not
issue
declaratory
judgment,
it
did
not
issue
anything
did
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
said
so
in
its
opinion,
it
did
not
issue
one,
because
the
judgment
is
substantive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
anything
different
from
the
opinion
filed?
instead
the
declaratory
judgment,
no—no
injunctions
were
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
remember
they
said
in
their
opinion
that
they
expected
you
to
abide
by,
did
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
quarrel
with
that
but
i
mean
it
is
so
strange
for
them
to
take
an
action
which
if
they
were
district
court
they
would
have
had
the
issue
of
injunction
or
declaratory
judgment.
but
sitting
in
the
court
of
appeal,
they
do
the
same
thing
but
they
do
not
on
the
other
hand--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
confused.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
most
cases,
can
the
other
party
give
the
right
to
answer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
most
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then,
they
did
not
have
right
answer
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
federal
government,
i
guess
we
get
to
the
point
eventually
where
the
court
could
just
read
statute
and
declare
it
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
last
paragraph
of
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
a
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
all
they
said?
and
they
put
the
state
under
that
point
but
say
we
expect
you
to
follow
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
kind
of
peculiar,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
that
your
client’s
is
suing
on
behalf
of
“their
patients”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
do
not
know
if
they
have
got
patients
in
that
too?
justice

justice
thurgood

to
pay
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
…dismiss
--the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
the
only
motion
that
was
granted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
relying
that
all
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
before
the
court
was
granting
on
the
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
all
before
the
court
of
appeals.
