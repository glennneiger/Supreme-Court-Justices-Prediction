justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that
maryland
policy
is
directed
not
merely
to
getting
the
hulks
off
the
highway
right
away
but
to
getting
them
even
off
the
wrecker’s
private
property
because
of
--.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
that
be
simply
executed
by
a
wrecker
to
the
processor
or
by
a
third
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
that
their
input
is
as
great
under
these
alternative
methods
as
it
was
before?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
according
to
mr.
lord
they
do
not
have
to
be
without
motor.
that
is
just
one
of
several
qualifications.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ramsey,
i
thought
mr.
lord’s
argument
was
that
if
the
processing
of
these
hulks
is
limited
to
maryland
plants
that
the
owner
could
at
least
have
someone
within
that
jurisdiction
to
go
to
and
sue
for
the
conversion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
in
the
case
of
your
client,
if
used
processors
in
alexandria,
a
maryland
claimant
to
the
hulk
is
going
to
have
to
go
into
the
virginia
courts.
if
mr.
lord’s
argument
is
right
that
the
bounty
is
limited
to
maryland
processors
he
will
have
something
within
his
own
jurisdiction
to
sue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
disagree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
is
that
not
entirely
consistent
with
the
commerce
clause
mr.
ramsey.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
one
thing
for
maryland
to
say
that
to
prohibit
you
from
shipping
something
out
of
maryland.
but
if
maryland
wants
to
bid
up
the
price
of
hulks
within
maryland,
i
would
think
that
is
quite
consistent
with
our
prior
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
all
prohibitions
though
by
the
state
against
doing
something
rather
than
simply
bidding
up
the
price,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wait
a
minute
mr.
ramsey,
under
your
theory
then
cars
formerly
titled
in
maryland
but
presently
being
driven
or
on
vermont
or
new
hampshire
would
be
subject
to
the
maryland
law,
does
that
make
much
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
to
get
hulks
of
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
interest
does
maryland
have
in
getting
better-looking
junkyards
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
it
is
you
–
you
are
the
one
that
is
doing
that
moving.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
in
the
district
court
about
those
two
affidavits
where
judge
coffman
said
that
it
is
suggested
that
there
are
some
recovered
from
the
district
of
columbia.
but
it
meant
that
that
was
not
critical
to
the
court’s
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
equal
protection
point,
let
me
pursue
the
same
line
of
inquiry
that
justice
stevens
just
asked
you
about,
if
a
western
state
is
having
problems
with
coyotes
and
passes
a
bounty
law
which
you
may
or
may
not
be
familiar
with,
so
much
ahead
for
killing
coyotes,
is
there
any
constitutional
problems
that
limits
that
bounty
to
its
own
residents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
on
his
license
you
say
you
are
out-of-state
and
you
can
hunt
but
you
are
not
entitled
to
the
bounty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ten
dollars.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
this
equal
protection
and
i
am
saying—
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
