mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
so,
i
would
like
to
lower
this.
mr.
lord
stand
somewhat
taller
than
i
do.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
very
convenient,
your
honor.
let
me
address
myself
if
i
may
to,
one
of
the
introductory
subject
matters
which
may
be
the
grounds
of
some
sort
of
confusion
in
this
case.
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
white
or
mr.
justice
brennan
who
inquired
concerning
the
impact
on
wreckers
and
what
a
wrecker
was.
the
wrecker
of
course
under
this
statutory
scheme,
i
believe
with
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
wrecker
is
a
man
who
does
in
fact
maintain
a
yard.
he
is
defined
to
be
a
man
who
maintains
a
yard.
the
purpose
of
the
yard
being
that
he
may
take
from
those
cars
which
he
has
on
the
yard,
usable
parts
for
the
purpose
of
vending
them
to
others
who
retain
cars
of
the
same
vintage.
a
tower
however,
term
which
mr.
lord
did
not
identify
for
the
court.
he
is
the
gentleman
who
comes
out
on
the
highways,
maintains
no
yard
in
which
he
stores
vehicles
which
have
been
subject
matter
of
wrecks,
maintains
no
yard
from
which
he
vends
spare
parts
but
who
simply
tows
in
the
total
automobile
off
the
beltway
accident
and
it
is
irreparable,
cannot
be
repaired
and
it
is
this
tower
who
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
licensure
under
the
maryland
organizations
statutory
structure,
who
is
the
large
source
of
vehicle
hulks.
he
is
also
the
large
source,
if
the
court
please,
of
those
vehicles
which
make
use
of
the
indemnity
agreement.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
could
do
either,
mr.
justice
brennan.
he
could
go
either
and
if
he
goes
to
a
processor,
it
was
in
this
area
that
you
will
see
the
subject
matter
of
appendices
which
are
very
detailed
in
analyzing
alexandria’s
performance,
where
they
got
their
vehicles
from,
their
hulks
i
should
say
more
properly,
why
it
was
that
they
felt
that
this
constituted
an
impingement
on
the
commerce,
the
interstate
commerce
because
needless
to
say,
sitting
as
this
court
does
in
this
district,
alexandria
scrap
it
is
just
over
the
petomi,
it
is
a
relatively
convenient
location
for
the
towing
of
hulks
from
that
graveyard
of
automobiles
that
we
call
our
beltway
around
washington
and
it
is
a
logical
place
to
which
vehicles
may
be
towed
as
distinct
from
a
wrecker
taking
them
in
by
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
did,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
this
is
the
basis.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
sir?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
it
would
be
an
abandoned
vehicle
to
which
he
would
be
giving
title.
it
would
be
in
excess
of
eight
years.
you
know
sir,
that
the
statute
talks
about
vehicles
in
excess
of
eight
years
of
age
without
motor
indicating
that
they
have
no
longer
serve
a
function
as
a
automobile
and
have
become
an
abandoned
vehicle
or
otherwise
totally
inoperable.
and
it
is
as—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
without
motor
or
inoperable
otherwise
totally
inoperable.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
it
could
mean
that
mr.
justice
marshall
when
in
a
spark
plugs.
but
in
any
event
may
i
address
myself
to
it
and
tell
you
the
classic
ways
in
which
this
might
occur,
sir.
in
the
event
that
you
had
a
vehicle
which
you
could
not
part
with,
and
so
i
did
what
is
on
my
mind,
it
simply
died
in
your
driveway
and
you
wanted
it
towed
away,
you
would
have
a
title.
you
might
however,
over
for
an
excess
of
eight
years
not
be
able
to
locate
that
title.
now
what
you
want
to
go
to
the
cost
and
expense
of
applying
for
a
new
title
or
a
duplicate
title
for
an
ancient
vehicle.
you
might
on
the
other
hand
suffer
the
ignominy
of
having
parked
in
your
front
yard
an
abandoned
motor
vehicle
which
somebody
else
just
pulled
up
and
left
which
we
see
on
the
streets
of
our
cities
at
all
times
utterly
abandoned,
stripped
down
by
youngsters
without
wheels,
without
distributor,
without
spark
plug,
but
a
clearly
abandoned
vehicle,
an
abandoned
property,
and
i
am
not
of
course,
trying
to
teach
the
court
law
as
respects
abandoned
property.
but
abandoned
property
signifies
to
us
just
that.
and
the
indemnity
agreement
really
says
to
the
processor.
i,
a
tower
found
this
car
under
conditions
which
i
deemed
it
to
have
been
an
abandoned
vehicle.
if
on
the
other
hand
there
is
any
question
raised,
i
sir
will
indemnify
you.
now,
here
is
where
mr.
lord’s
argument
falls
considerably
short
because
he
attempts
to
direct
this
court’s
intention
to
the
necessity
of
having
a
maryland
agreement.
that
agreement
does
not
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
state
of
maryland.
that
agreement
inures
to
the
benefit
in
my
case
of
alexandria
scrap
and
if
alexandria
scrap
should
make
the
mistake
and
again
justice
marshall
i
am
back
to
line
of
inquiry
that
you
addressed
me
sir,
if
i
should,
on
behalf
of
alexandria
scrap
say
to
my
client,
yes
sir,
you
may
accept
that
indemnification
and
some
judge
or
jury
thereafter
said,
that
chattel
had
not
lost
its
true
ownership
and
you
are
a
converter
of
the
chattel,
i
would
suffer
whatever
the
civil
and/or
criminal
consequences
which
might
follow,
although,
civil
would
be
far
more
likely
given
the
type
chattel
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
was
found.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
the
owner
could
--
well,
he
has
the
same
person
or
persons
in
this
line
to
sue
for
the
conversion.
now
keep
in
mind
sir
that—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
justice
rehnquist’s—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
–
yes,
but
i
stepped
backward—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
step
back
into
your
premise
sir.
i
do
not
agree
with
mr.
lord’s
argument
because
under
the
regulations
as
they
are
enacted
in
maryland
and
as
we
have
adhered
to
them
we
have
an
office
in
maryland,
our
president
lives
in
maryland
and
we
maintain
a
license
under
maryland
law
and
we
may
be
reached
by
service
of
process
by
maryland.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
not
think
you
need
to
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
that
this
same
issue
was
addressed
by
the
three-judge
court
which
heard
us
below.
it
is
discussed
by
judge
coffman
who
wrote
the
opinion
for
three-judge
court.
the
fact
of
our
licensure
in
maryland
and
the
fact
of
our
office
in
maryland
is
discussed
by
judge
coffman
and
the
three-judge
court
had
no
difficulty
whatsoever
with
the
fact
that
alexandria
scrap
could
be
subjected
to
the
court
processes
of
maryland,
none
and
i
am
saying
to
you
sir
that
the
structure
of
the
maryland
act
and
mind
you,
mr.
lord
attempts
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
bounty
program
in
its
broad
scope.
we
say
to
you
that
the
bounty
program
is
not
what
this
case
is
about.
if
you
read
the
record
in
this
case
you
will
find,
gentlemen
of
the
court
that
when
a
$16.00
payment
is
made
to
a
processor,
fourteen
of
it
goes
back
out
to
the
tower
who
delivers
the
hulk
to
the
processor.
the
states
brief
would
have
this
court
believe,
understand,
or
find
that
we
are
in
this
business
and
are
constructing
a
$1
million
bailer
or
shredder
and
an
enormous
processing
plant
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
bounties
from
the
state
of
maryland
for
hulk
automobiles.
we
are
running
a
processing
plant
requiring
some
50
to
60
thousand
hulks
a
year.
our
constitutional
complaint
is
that
when
the
legislature
of
maryland
attempts
to
deprive
our
plant
of
the
right
to
compete
on
an
even
footing
in
interstate
commerce
with
those
processors
and
intrastate
commerce
who
also
want
60
thousand
hulks
a
year
to
keep
their
gold
finger
machine
as
mr.
lord
described
it,
the
one
that
takes
a
car
and
crams
into
a
2x2x5
bail.
we
want
them
and
they
want
them.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
certainly
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
suggesting
sir
that
the
record
will
sustain
me
in
saying
that
it
is
essentially
7/8th
of
it
has
gone
back
to
the
persons
who
delivered
them
to
us
because
we
analyze,
mr.
lord
and
you
will
notice
this
dichotomy
really
between
the
state's
approach
and
the
approach
of
alexandria
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
or
we
are
–
i
am
unfortunately
asking
the
court
to
bring
together
divergent
views
of
trains
running
on
somewhat
separate
track.
the
state
keeps
talking
about
the
money
we
have
gotten.
we
kept
talking
about
the
hulks
we
have
not
gotten
because
it
is
the
hulk
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
commerce.
it
is
the
hulk
which
maryland
has
affixed
an
added
value
to
by
its
bounty
program.
they
have
made
it
to
the
person
who
gathers
it
out
of
the
woods,
off
the
street,
out
of
the
side
yard
of
your
home
if
you
have
abandoned
it.
it
is
to
that
hulk
that
they
have
affixed
this
added
value.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
it
is
not
justice
rehnquist,
although
having
reviewed
the
various
commerce
clause
cases
in
preparation
for
the
argument.
the
commerce
clause
cases
diverged
in
many
respect
but
it
essentially
says
this,
we
as
a
licensed
person
participating
in
this
program
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
maryland
and
in
the
interstate
have
distinct
from
intrastate
aspects
of
it
are
entitled
to
be
treated
even
handedly
and
to
have
our
fair
shot
at
the
market.
they
cannot
appreciate
the
value
of
the
hulk.
and
then
say
that
by
virtue
of
appreciation
of
the
value
of
the
hulk
only
a
maryland
processor
may
have
a
crack
at
those
appreciated
hulks
where
we
are
in
the
state.
now,
you
are
mixing
admittedly
or
i
am
mixing,
you
are
not
sir,
equal
protection
and
commerce
clause
but
the
cases
and
considerations
do
tend
to
merge
and
overlap
with
each
other.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
on
the
commerce
clause,
i
think
the
court
will
note
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
note
the
repetition
and
consider
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
sir.
considerable
comeback
to
the
of
hood,
polar
ice
cream,
dean
milk,
baldwin,
seeling,
these
are
in
the
milk
field
essentially,
justice
rehnquist
you
will
recall.
and
the
pike
against
bruce
church
which
is
the
arizona
cantaloupe
packing
case
and
halliburton
oil
which
is
--
that
is
the
group
of
cases
which
i
think
you
will
find
essentially
are
the
heartland
of
our
commerce
clause
argument.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
fair
description
of
the
totality
of
the
opinions,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
is
the
posture
in
which
the
state
has
attempted
to
put
them
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
fairly
states
the
scope
of
the
cases
as
this
court
has
laid
them
down
in
connection
with
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
is
there
any
valid
distinction?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
not
sir.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
as
you
would
note
sir,
when
you
intermix
the
concepts
of
each
of
these
various
cases
and
where
the
court
has
talked
in
terms
of
a
prohibition
in
a
given
instances
being
constitutionally
interdicted
obviously
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
may
tend
that
way.
we
submit
however,
sir,
that
they
are
equally
valid
in
support
of
our
current
position
which
i
think
is
the
precise
answer
to
the
exact
question
which
you
addressed
to
me
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
have
misled
you
slightly
sir
by
the
way
i
have
put
it.
if
you
have
a
wrecker
who
delivers
under
a
wrecker’s
certificate,
that
is
the
wrecker,
the
man
with
the
yard
who
strips
the
car
for
parts.
it
is
split
eight
to
the
wrecker
and
eight
to
the
processor.
on
the
other
hand
if
you
have
an
unlicensed,
a
tower,
the
gentleman
i
earlier
started
to
describe,
the
man
who
picks
up
the
inoperative
cars
but
who
does
not
retain
them
for
use
or
cannibalizing
for
parts,
then
$16.00
goes
to
the
processor
and
the
processor
rebates
and
has
for
years
14
of
the
16
to
the
man
who
delivered
to
him.
have
i
clarified
the
problem,
justice
blackmun?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no.
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement
between
the
parties
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
a
wrecker
and
the
tower.
no
disagreements
of
the
statutory
structure,
carries
an
eight
and
eight
breakup
where
it
is
a
wrecker
who
delivers
the
hulk
and
you
can
visualize
the
logic
of
it.
he
is
presumably
cannibalized
the
hulk
down.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
would
be
–
if
a
tower
brought
it
in—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
if
he
personally
drove
it
up
then
he
would
–
we
would
talk
to
him
about
the
market
value
of
a
scrap
hulk
at
that
point.
we
would
not
talk
bounty.
he
is
not
qualified
to
get
bounty.
he
is
not
a
wrecker,
he
is
not
a
tower,
he
is
not
anything
in
the
delivery
market.
he
is
an
owner.
and
may
i
say
sir,
if
you
drove
your
own
car
up
to
alexandria,
we
would
talk
to
you
sir
on
the
basis
of
what
is
the
going
value
of
an
automobile
of
this
particular
--
and
that
–
now
you
are
talking—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
not
--
get
anything
from
justice
blackmun’s
car.
we
would
get
the
body
and
we
would
pay
you
what
might
be
called
fair
market
value
your
honor.
that
would
be
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
if
it
were
jack
benny,
and
he
was
still
alive,
god
bless
him,
i
think
he
would
probably
want
20,
justice
white,
but
i
think
we
would
resist
but
i
think
he
would
ask
for
it.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
and
that
is
enlarged
in
our
brief
and
that
is
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
about
2:1
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
and
you
will
find
a
full
schedule
of
where
we
got
them,
who
he
got
them
from
and
a
number
of
hulks
that
you
got
from
each
the
category
in
the—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
suspect
sir
if
you
are
talking
about
--
we
are
back
into
that
esoteric
field
of
who
can
get
title
from
a
thief
and
i
think
the
answer
has
always
been
nobody.
therefore,
what
passed
on
through
that
chain
would
be
a
claimed
right
and
asserted
right
to
the
property
in
the
hulk
but
in
fact
nobody
after
the
owner
from
whom
it
was
stolen
could
acquire
a
genuine
title.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
to
the
processor?
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct
sir.
right
now
the
only
way
in
which
that
would
be
helpful
as
a
qualified
processor
and
alexandria
remains
a
qualified
processor
under
maryland
law
right
down
to
today.
but
we
would
have
filed
with
the
department
the
title,
the
vin
plate,
the
vehicle
identification
number
plate,
the
indemnity
agreement.
we
would
show
by
that
indemnity
agreement
that
alexandria
scrap,
a
processor
which
has
an
office
in
silver
spring,
maryland
and
holds
a
license
under
the
regs
received
a
1969
automobile
which
mr.
justice
white
believes
is
stolen
from
his
front
yard
and
that
it
was
received
from
joseph
smith
hauling
company.
now,
when
you
come
to
us
sir
and
say,
i
think
my
car
was
stolen,
nobody
had
good
title,
the
department
would
be
able
to
tell
you
that
joseph
smith
of
rockville
was
the
tower
who
hauled
it
away,
alexandria
scrap
was
the
processor
who
compressed
it
into
a
2
x
2
x
5—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
think
that
is
correct.
it
is
the
old
deep
pocket
doctrine,
which
one
would
you
look
to
for
the
easiest
collection.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you
wanted
to
get
to
us
you
have
us
in
maryland
and
you
have
us
under
the
thumb
of
the
maryland
vehicle
administration
just
as
surely
as
you
have
everybody
else
because
of
the
office,
our
presidency—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is,
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
early
stages
it
was,
if
you
had
a
plant
of
a
certain
type
and
you
had
to
have
an
office
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
is
not
stated
in
terms
of
process,
it
is
stated
in
terms
of
maintain
an
office
in
the
state
and
you
have
to
certify
where
that
office
is.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
this
is
what
a
three-judge
court
in
effect
said,
here
they
are,
these
are
the
circumstances
under
which
this
particular
process,
they
find
itself.
now
insofar
as
the
comments
made
by
mr.
lord
concerning
the
justifications
under
the
equal
protection
aspects
of
the
argument,
we
have
addressed
the
equal
protection
aspects
of
the
argument
and
addressed
them
fully
in
the
brief
which
we
have
filed.
and
we
submit
that
there
can
be
shown
to
be
no
rational
basis
for
what
the
state
says
it
was
doing.
the
operative
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
we
think
we
fully
answered
that
mr.
justice
brennan
in
connection
with
it,
it
essentially
turns
itself
on
essentially
what
we
are
talking
about
earlier.
we
are
licensees.
they
let
us
in.
they
laid
down
their
conditions.
we
met
them,
there
we
are
and
we
ought
to
be
entitled
to
be
treated
fairly
and
with
no
invidious
discrimination
against
us
while
we
are
within
that
state
and
operating.
if
what
they
are
trying
to
do
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
the
real
problem
with
this
case
is
this.
the
state’s
brief
describes
and
state
counsel
below
in
argument
before
the
three-judge
court
handedly
conceded
that
when
this
statute,
which
we
have
before
the
court
here
today,
went
in
to
the
legislature
of
maryland
it
did
not
discriminate
against
out-of-staters.
it
did
not
gentlemen
of
the
court,
restrict
the
payments
of
bounty
to
cars
found
abandoned
within
maryland.
it
does
not
today.
it
has
to
do
with
cars
formerly
titled
in
maryland,
title
and
abandonment
spot
are
two
entirely
different
things.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no.
you
are—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
now,
yours
is
a
reduction
to
the
absurd
sir
and
i
am
willing
to
agree
that
it
does
reduce
it
to
the
absurd.
but
you
have
got
to
visualize
that
what
we
are
really
confronted
here
in
maryland
is
the
problem
of
the
district
of
columbia.
that
is
to
say,
maryland
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
no,
no,
no.
now
you
have
moved
one
aspect
of
the
act
into
the
other
aspect
of
the
act.
it
does
not
deal
with
wrecker
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
am
talking
about
the
towers,
when
a
tower
comes
out
of
d.c.
with
a
car
with
a
maryland
title,
the
access
and
the
inquiry
that
the
court
has
put
to
me,
i
submit
is
why
did
the
state
say
it
was
interested
in
cars
titled
in
maryland.
that
is
was
what
the
act
said,
it
does
not
say
cars
abandoned
in
maryland.
as
to
wreckers’
yards,
it
says
yes.
we
are
cleaning
out
our
own
wreckers’
yards.
but
as
to
vehicles
such
as
these
indemnity
agreement
type
vehicles,
it
talks
in
terms
of
titled
in
not
abandoned
in
nor
had
the
state
nor
had
the
administrator,
nor
had
the
legislature,
nor
had
anybody
and
this
was
conceded
in
colloquy
before
the
three-judge
court.
nobody
had
ever
said
that
it
was
required
that
these
cars
be
abandoned
in
maryland.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
they
construed
it
as
violative
of
both
the
commerce
clause
and
equal
protection
sir
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
they
clearly
say
and
judge
miller
i
think
put
the
spots
right
on
in
the
colloquy,
yes
it
would
and
today
a
processor
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
what
it
says
and
that
is
the
way
they
read
it,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
it
was
an
irrelevant
fact
justice
rehnquist
was
what
this
court
was
really
saying
because
never
had
there
been
any
regulation,
any
statutory
requirement
or
any
other
requirement
that
the
car
be
abandoned
in
maryland
in
order
to
be
the
subject
of
(inaudible)
and
counsel
for
the
state
conceded
that.
the
regs
show
it.
the
statute
shows
it.
and
that
was
what
mr.
judge
coffman
was
addressing
himself
to
as
respect
to
that.
now,
as
respects
to
where
it
was
claimed
that
both,
two
processors
had
submitted
the
same
vin
plate
or
may
claim
on
the
same
car
with
no
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
our
men
did
not
in
fact
process
that
our
man
was
not
the
one
who
did
process.
and
that
was
what
judge
coffman
said
on
that
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
you
will
find
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court.
but
in
essence,
what
this
court
did
was
analyze
what
was
before
it
and
say
that
there
are
no
relevant
or
material
considerations.
and
that
this
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
the
states
amendment
because
a
practical
matter,
if
the
statute
has
never
been
enforced
this
way.
the
regs
have
never
been
enforced
this
way.
it
is
simply
has
not
work
this
way
and
to
say
now
that
this
is
rational
basis
is
simply
not
supportable
and
it
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
what
was
claimed
to
be
the
discrimination
which
was
admitted
to
exist.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
have
no
knowledge
and
my
research
did
not
develop
a
case
which
dealt
with
a
bounty
payment
as
such,
justice
stevens
and
i
cannot
answer
you
any
affirmative.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
say
if
it,
you
are
talking
now,
i
may
not
live
in
a
western
state
but
i
have
watched
gun
smoke
and
things
that
sort
of
enough
to
have
a
passing
familiarity
with
the
concept.
my
answer
to
that
would
be
that
so
long
as
there
was
no
invidious
discrimination
against
someone
who
was
a
licensed
bounty
hunter,
this
would
put
it
in
our
category.
if
you
license
a
bounty
hunter
and
the
guy
is
in
there
hunting
you
ought
to
treat
him
fairly
with
every
other
bounty
hunter.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
right.
you
would
be
requiring
–
your
home
state
of
arizona,
let
us
say
would
require
that
the
coyote
be
shot
in
arizona
by
an
arizona
citizen
delivered
to
an
arizona
sheriff
and
then
you
get
your
$2.00
or
whatever
it
may
be.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
not,
i
would
think
you
would
come
back
justice
rehnquist
to
the
essential
problem
of
whether
the
coyote
as
such
is
an
article
of
commerce.
scrap
we
think
is
fully
established
on
this
record.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
you
are
talking
equal
protection.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
as
a
respect
to
equal
protection,
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
closer
argument
that
you
could
restrict
to
the
citizens
of
arizona
and
require
them
to
shoot
them
there,
turn
them
in
there
and
get
to
bounty
there..
and
to
be
a
citizens
of
the
state
in
which
the
coyote
was
in
fact
captured
so
to
speak.
and
i
do
not
think
you
could
stop
me
of
a
maryland
necessarily
from
coming
in
there,
if
i
moved
in,
and
had
a
residence
as
distinct
from
the
citizenship.
if
you
were
putting
in
terms
of
citizenship
i
would—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
yes
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
not
subsidized,
there
is
no
--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
think
justice
white
you
pose
the
other
side
of
the
problem
of
the
category
of
commerce
clause
cases
that
i
relied
on
which--
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
think
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
converse
of
it,
that
is
to
say
where
the
virginia
wish
to
come
in
and
buy
the
maryland
milk
in
order
--
that
is
the
new
york
milk
producers
case
and
the
boston—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct.
but
there
is
no—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
do
not
think
you—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
that
is
correct.
it
does—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
he
does
not
choose
to
come
in.
but
that
is
a
supplement
which
they
are
giving
to
their
own
citizens
in
that
sense.
and
all
i
am
saying
is
that
when
you
admit
us
to
participate
in
your
market
as
we
have
been
admitted
in
the
past
that
you
cannot
then
impinge
on
interstate
commerce.
we
as
one
of
the
leading
representatives
of
interstate
commerce
separated
by
a
bridge
from
maryland,
that
is
what
it
amounts
to
and
not
even
a
bridge
because
i
think
the
rivers
in
maryland’s
but
the—
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
i
would
think
sir
that
then
you
would
be
dead
on
my
case
in
part
and
i
think
you
would
be
guilty
of
a
situation
in
which
commerce
clause
would
impact
that
particular
arrangement.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
sir.
mr.
norman
p.
ramsey
well,
i
think
there
are
differences
between
those
two
illustrations
which
the
court
has
posed
to
me
and
i
simply
submit
that
on
the
second
of
the
illustration
which
you
gave
me,
you
would
be
in
problems
as
respect
to
commerce
clause.
in
the
first
of
them
you
would
be
further
away
but
you
might
be
subjects
to
attacks
such
as
in
the
hood
case
and
in
the
seeling
case
where
you
had
the
retention
for
own
use
within
own
state
to
the
disadvantage
of
one
of
the
sister
states
who
seek
to
serve
its
market
out
of
your
available
resources.
and
the
constitution
in
fact
permit
us
to
go
from
state
to
state,
free
of
improper
impediments
against
their
right
to
deal.
court
please,
i
note
that
i
am
in
the
closing
minutes
of
my
presentation
and
i
would
simply
return
to
one
additional
point
made
by
mr.
lord
in
connection
with
56
units
which
he
says
on
the
record
were
wrongfully
paid
for
to
alexandria.
i
will
submit
that
upon
examination
of
the
record
you
will
not
find
evidence
that
alexandria
was
paid
for
any
units.
it
was
improper
to
pay
it
for,
these
again
revert
to
the
substance
of
mr.
lord’s
argument
that
if
you
pick
a
car
up
out
of
maryland
that
you
need
must
restrict
the
right
to
receive
bounty.
now,
for
the
courts
benefit
in
the
record
although
not
printed
in
your
appendix
at
pages,
record
pages
261
through
266
the
court
will
find
specimens
of
indemnity
agreements
which
were
agreed
to
be
the
forms
which
were
and
had
been
in
use.
upon
checking
those
indemnity
agreements
accepted
by
the
state
of
maryland,
you
will
note
that
alexandria
scrap
was
the
only
one
whose
indemnity
agreement
showed
where
the
vehicle
was
picked
up.
all
other
indemnity
agreements
simply
showed
the
license
number,
the
make
and
the
model.
there
was
nothing,
no
question
raised
as
respect
where
these
vehicles
had
been
abandoned
in
order
to
accept
indemnity
agreements
from
various
persons
who
had
participated
in
the
program.
and
i
thank
the
court
very
much.
