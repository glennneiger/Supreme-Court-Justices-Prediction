unknown
speaker
i
think
the
wrecker
who
must
be
a
resident
and
a
processor
who
may
or
may
not
be
a
resident,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
does
the
wrecker
do
that
a
processor
does
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
bounty,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
either
the
half
shared
with
the
wrecker
or
the
whole?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
might
be
your
own
vehicle?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
pretty
quickly,
would
you
not
or?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
now
which
is
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
he
must
be
a
maryland
resident
with
a
plant
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
if
you
had
a
virginia
resident
with
a
plant
in
maryland,
he
would
not
be
a
maryland
processor.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
he
has
more
than
one
plant,
one
in
maryland
and
one
in
virginia,
is
he
still
alright?
unknown
speaker
would
have
to
be
--
unknown
speaker
just
to
clarify
the
tag
on
this,
under
--
on
these
vehicles,
these
over
eight-year-old
vehicles,
must
the
processor
actually
process
the
vehicle
in
a
plant
in
maryland
or
just
have
a
plant
in
maryland?
how
do
you
consider
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
processed
that
particular
car
outside
of
maryland?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
answer
is
yes,
so
you
would
be
all
right
if
he
processed
that,
crossed
the
line
in
some
other
state?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
the
indemnity
agreement
is
executed
in
maryland.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
a
processor
has
a
plant
in
maryland
and
one
just
across
the
line
in
virginia
and
he
goes
around
and
picks
up
wrecked
cars
and
when
he
picks
one
up
from
an
owner
he
gives
an
indemnity
agreement
right
on
the
spot.
he
has
a
plant
in
maryland,
they
have
just
have
to
be
close
to
his
plant
in
virginia
so
he
takes
it
over
in
virginia.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
but
tell
me
again,
what
is
the
significance
of
an
indemnity
agreement?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
did
you
not
say
that
the
state
would
be
barred
by
the
constitution
to
have
a
long
arm
statute
that
would
reach
them.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
existing
maryland
law
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
owner
of
an
eight-year-old
inoperable
vehicle
hulk.
unknown
speaker
--
without
an
engine,
among
other
things?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
if
some
of
these
are
made
of
pure
gold,
this
is
such
a
valuable
right
on
the
part
of
the
owner.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
alexandria
is
a
person
for
purpose
of
the—
unknown
speaker
upon
that
premise
but
you
do
not
concede.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
at
all
to
keep
the
body
payments
within
the
state
of
maryland?
unknown
speaker
the
one
reason
would
be
that
they
might
pick
up
maryland
income
tax
on
them.
but
they
do
not
from
alexandria
maybe
i
do
not
know.
unknown
speaker
precisely,
it
raises
some
constitutional
questions.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
why
you
are
avoiding
it?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
third?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
without
motor.
unknown
speaker
but
it
could
be
unknown
speaker
it
is
fair
to
say
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
$219,000.00
that
apparently
alexandria
received
in
bounty,
i
think
mr.
lord
told
us—
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
7/8th
of
that
has
gone
back
to
towers?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
is
your
strongest
case
supporting
your
position
on
the
commerce
clause
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
answer
the
question?
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
you
would
get
the
bounty
then?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
one
more
question,
did
i
understand
that
you
said
the
larger
proportion
of
the
hulks
that
alexandria
acquires
in
maryland
come
from
towers?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
percentage,
roughly
between
towers
and
wreckers?
unknown
speaker
but
really,
if
you
could
get
at
the
fellow
who
gave
the
indemnity
agreement
and
if
he
was
any
good,
it
would
not
make
any
difference
who
the
processor
was.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
construe
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
did
they
first
–
how
did
they
–
does
the
bounty
reach
cars
abandoned
outside
maryland?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
they
were
titled
the
three-judge
court
construed
the
maryland
law
to
mean
that?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
maryland
wanted
to
make
sure
there
is
enough
fresh
milk
to
supply
the
needs
of
its
citizens
and
it
decided
that
it
would
subsidize
dairy
farmers
in
maryland,
its
own
dairy
farmers
in
maryland.
unknown
speaker
and
that
made
it
worth
their
while
but
it
just
will
not
pay
--
will
not
subsidize
the
production
of
milk
outside
the
state
of
maryland.
