mr.
henry
r.
lord
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
plaintiff
here
of
virginia
corporation
has
attacked
successfully
up
until
this
moment
before
a
three-judge
court
on
equal
protection
and
commerce
clause
grounds,
a
sub
part
of
a
single
aspect
of
maryland’s
enlightened
and
comprehensive
program
unique
in
the
nation
for
removing
from
the
highways
and
junkyards
of
the
state
blighted
automobiles.
the
operative
facts
here
although
somewhat
dreary
and
inelegant
are
nonetheless
quite
important
to
a
full
understanding
of
the
program
and
of
the
constitutional
claims
at
least
in
our
view
are
relatively
simple
despite
the
fact
that
the
appellee
here
has
filed
a
40-page
statement
of
the
case.
i
would
like
to
take
5
minutes
to
touch
on
those
facts.
this
program
originated
as
a
result
of
careful
study
made
in
1967
by
the
legislative
council
of
maryland
of
the
very
problem
that
i
have
described
a
minute
ago.
the
counsel
report
is
in
the
record
and
i
think
a
reading
of
it
will
indicate
the
attention
that
was
giving
to
the
problem.
the
counsel
recognized
that
hulks
accumulated
on
the
lots
of
automobile
wreckers
throughout
the
state,
largely
because
the
free
market
mechanism
at
that
time
provided
very
little
financial
incentive
to
wreckers
to
place
these
vehicles
in
the
hands
of
scrap
processors
for
recycling.
accordingly,
a
three-part
program
with
both
carrot
and
stick
aspects
was
adopted
in
1969.
part
one,
required
all
wreckers
to
be
licensed
and
it
limited
the
wreckers
in
the
way
that
they
maintain
their
yards.
there
were
density
requirements
and
stacking
requirements
as
to
heights
of
vehicles
so
that
inspection
could
be
done
more
readily
and
also
--
so
that
the
blight
would
not
be
as
obvious
from
the
roads.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
now,
out-of-state
processors
were
also
licensed
for
the
first
time.
in
fact,
in
the
1969
statute
provided
that
wreckers
had
to
be
resident
in
the
state
of
maryland
to
be
licensed
but
processors
such
as
the
plaintiff
could
be
licensed
no
matter
where
they
operated.
it
being
recognized
that
an
out-of-state
processor
could
contribute
just
as
well
to
solving
the
environmental
problem
of
maryland
by
removing
this
hulks
from
the
highways.
now,
as
far
as
an
out-of-state
processor
is
concerned,
the
licensing
requirements
were
and
are
identical,
same
fee,
they
must
have
the
same
sort
of
equipment.
the
equipment,
i
think
was
described
in
an
article
which
is
in
the
record
but
very
quickly
a
processors
equipment
must
include
a
hydraulic
bailer
which
is
known
in
the
trade
as
a
gold
finger
machine,
reduces
an
automobile
to
a
2
x
2
x
5
foot
bail.
or
a
shredder
or
what
is
known
as
sheers,
that
plus
payment
of
the
fee
plus
maintaining
of
at
least
a
nominal
office
in
the
state,
although
records
do
not
have
to
be
kept
there
and
compliance
with
other
rather
rudimentary
maryland
regulations
admit
an
out-of-state
processor
to
the
maryland
program.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
a
wrecker,
your
honor
is
a
person
who
takes
possession
of
hulks
of
automobiles,
holds
them
for
resale
for
the
value
of
all
the
wreck
or
of
the
parts.
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
a
wrecker
is
very
often
the
source
of
hulks
to
clients
such
as
my
brother
represents
here
today.
the
processor,
they
are
the
source
to
the
processor,
one
of
several.
i
suppose
that
is
the
next
equal
protection
case
we
will
have
to
defend
is
one
based
on
that
distinction.
but
that
distinction
does
not
have
to
be
before
this
court.
we
have
already
had
one
equal
protection
challenge
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
suffice
it
to
say
that
alexandria
qualified
and
was
licensed
–
so
that
is
one
part
of
the
program.
part
two
is
the
stick
aspect
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
continuing
fine
assessed
against
a
wrecker
who
maintains
in
his
possession
for
more
than
a
six
months
–
for
more
than
a
one
year
period
of
vehicle
more
than
ten
years
old.
so
it
becomes
economically
a
liability
to
him
to
keep
it
there.
it
is
encouraging
him
to
move
it
off
to
a
processor.
and
so
it
is
really
encouraging
commerce
at
least
in
this
aspect.
now
the
third
facet
is
the
carrot,
the
carrot
is
the
bounty,
the
bounty
is
payable
if
a
licensed
wrecker
is
involved,
half
to
the
licensed
wrecker
delivering
the
hulk,
half
to
the
processor.
in
the
event
that
there
is
no
licensed
wrecker,
if
some
other
source
has
brought
the
vehicle
abandoned
in
maryland
to
the
processor,
the
entire
$16
which
is
the
current
total,
although
it
is
varied
over
the
years
is
paid
to
the
processor.
it
is
an
extra
bonus
in
effect
for
ridding
maryland
of
another
hulk
vehicle.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
exactly
correct.
i
would
say
there
is
an
equal
interest
in
both.
but
the
program,
although
the
statute
could
be
clear
on
this
is
restricted
to
hulks
that
have
been
abandoned
in
maryland
--
any
fair
reading
in
the
statute
i
think
will
indicate
that.
and
their
definitions
in
the
statute
which
i
think
support
that.
now,
that
is
the
program.
now
what
has
happened
under
the
program
is
that
in
the
five
years
of
its
existence,
simple
mathematics
applied
to
the
dollar
figures
in
the
records
would
indicate
that
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
vehicles
have
been
removed
from
the
junkyards,
to
use
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
and
the
highways
of
the
state,
abandoned
cars.
now,
who
knows
how
many
would
have
been
removed
if
there
had
not
been
a
bounty
program
but
it
is
fair
to
say
that
a
very
high
percentage
of
those
are
the
result
of
the
inducements
already
described.
now,
the
record
further
shows
that
alexandria
has
participated
in
this
program
from
its
inception
and
has
received
an
excess
of
$219,000.00
of
money
from
maryland’s
treasury
under
the
program.
money,
of
course
could
not
have
received
without
the
program
it
might
have
received
the
hulks
and
it
might
have
received
just
as
many
of
them.
but
it
would
not
have
received
the
bounty
because
it
was
not
in
existence.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
precisely,
your
honor.
now,
as
with
any
new
and
innovative
program,
the
general
assembly
since
its
inception
has
constantly
monitored
this
program
in
the
light
of
experience.
and
a
review
of
the
maryland
acts
for
the
last
several
years
will
indicate
that
there
have
been
at
least
a
dozen
amendments
probably
as
many
as
a
dozen-and-a-half
to
this
program,
different
parts
of
it
is.
it
is
a
complicated
lengthy
piece
of
statutory
material.
one
of
these
amendments,
chapter
465
of
the
laws
of
maryland
of
1974
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
now,
the
challenged
amendment
does
not
relate
in
any
way
to
the
three-part
program
described.
it
does
not
even
relate
to
the
entire
bounty
program.
it
relates
to
the
manner
by
which
vehicles
in
a
certain
category
and
bear
in
mind
that
this
bounty
is
available
on
all
abandoned
vehicles
no
matter
whether
it
was
an
aston
martin
that
just
rolled
off
the
assembly
lines.
but
the
one
category
that
is
being
complained
about
is
an
eight-year-old
and
inoperable
vehicle
which
prior
to
the
74
amendment
for
out-of-state
processors
could
be
received
and
a
bounty
paid
thereon
by
virtue
of
something
known
as
an
indemnity
agreement.
an
agreement
between
the
person
delivering
the
vehicle
to
the
processor
and
the
processor
himself
executed
of
course
at
the
door
of
the
processors
plant
upon
the
delivery
of
the
vehicle.
in
effect
holding
harmless,
the
processor
for
any
claims
by
prior
person
entitled.
that
is
really
what
this
case
comes
down
to.
now,
prior
to
that
amendment
--
we
will
come
to
this
in
a
more
clearly
in
the
equal
protection
discussion.
prior
to
that
amendment,
vehicles
in
that
category
could
really
be
destroyed
without
any
due
process
notions
that
traditionally
have
been
applied.
the
notice,
the
publication,
all
of
which
is
carefully
written
into
the
first
part
of
the
statute
was
absent
in
this
last
part
and
if
the
court
would
like
to
direct
its
attention
to
the
statute,
it
is
found
in
17a
in
the
appendix
in
18a
–
i
am
sorry,
15a
and
16a.
now—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
all
of
the
language
in
caps
are
at
16a
is
the
new
language
of
the
74
amendment.
as
in
artistically
drafted
as
any
piece
of
legislation
one
could
imagine
but
i
think
all
the
parties
here
know
what
it
means
and
we
are
interpreting
it
in
a
uniform
matter.
all
of
the
prior
language
which
overflows
to
15a
and
16a
says
in
essence
only
this,
anybody
who
is
licensed,
unlicensed,
resident
or
non-resident
who
comes
into
the
possession
of
a
vehicle,
eight
years
old
and
inoperable
can
transfer
that
into
the
bounty
program
through
a
processor
without
the
title
and
without
notification
procedures.
it
is
open-ended
and
really
threatened
to
swallow
up
all
of
the
carefully
drafted
aspects
of
the
statute
which
are
laid
out
at
the
prior
ten
or
15
pages
of
the
record.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well
it
would
–
i
think
it
is
fair
to—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
that
is
true
but
i
think
the
record
also
states
that
the
bulk
of
vehicles
processed
through
the
bounty
program
fall
in
that
category.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
you
may
--
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
as
of
couple
of
years
ago
less
than
5%
of
the
vehicles
on
the
road
were
seven
years
old
and
older,
something
like
that.
now,
it
is
this
amendment
that
is
being
challenged
and
it
is
being
challenged
obviously
on
two
grounds.
but
i
think
it
is
important
before
we
go
to
the
constitutional
challenges
to
see
exactly
what
that
new
statute,
the
amendment
that
is
challenged
does.
first
of
all
it
says,
that
for
maryland
processors
indemnity
agreements
are
permitted
to
an
announcement
of
maryland
public
policy.
for
the
first
time,
there
was
no
reference
prior
to
that
anywhere
in
that
statute
to
indemnity
agreements.
it
may
have
been
the
practice
and
i
understand
it
was
although
the–
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
may
has
been
deleted,
that
is
a
legislative
symbology
there
and
it
now
read
shall.
and
so,
in
each
instance
now
with
the
maryland
processor
indemnity
agreement
is
required
to
be
executed
and
submitted
to
the
motor
vehicle
administration.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
maryland—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
think
that
he
may
well
be
because
what
you
are
looking
at
for
the
public
policy
reason
is
whether
an
indemnity
agreement
executed
in
maryland
is
valid
public
policy
in
maryland.
and
the
indemnity
agreement
is
executed
at
the
processor’s
plant.
if
that
plant
is
in
maryland,
i
think
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
he
would
be
all
right,
now
the—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
would
read
that
and
i
think
my
brothers
read
it
the
same
way
that
under
this
amendment
to
qualify
alexandria
would
have
to
open
a
plant
in
maryland.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
it
would
not
have
to
be
as
exclusive
plant,
and
then
you
would
have
an
indemnity
agreement
in
each
instance
at
that
plan
executed
in
a
state.
all
right—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
now,
the
other
aspect
is
that
the
manufacturer’s
serial
number
or
identification
number
must
be
sent
in
also,
in
effect
added
protections
–
mr.
henry
r.
lord
in
this
category?
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
if
we
had
a
plant
in
maryland
and
indemnity
agreements
were
executed
in
maryland
he
would
be
a
maryland
processor
for
the
purpose
of
that
statue.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
think
it
would
be
where
the
indemnity
agreement
was
entered
into,
your
honor.
one
of
the
points
on
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
think
the
question
really
should
be
answered
as
to
where
the
indemnity
agreement
is
executed.
now
i
think
–
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
the
only
way
that
would
happen,
your
honor
is
factually
is
by
delivery
to
the
plant
in
maryland.
because
that
is
where
the
indemnity
agreement
would
be
executed
and
it
is
plaintiff’s
position
that
he
would
have
to
open
a
processing
plant
in
maryland
to
qualify
under
this
amendment
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
fair
reading–
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
think
to
present
the
argument
in
its
cleanest
form,
i
think
that
the
state’s
position
would
be
that
that
vehicle
would
have
to
be
processed
at
the
maryland
plant.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
and
as
a
matter
of
practice
that
i
know
would
happen
in
all
instances.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
an
indemnity
agreement
has
places
behind
the
processor
as
far
as
liability
is
concerned
to
seller,
an
unlicensed
person
could
be
anyone.
it
says
to
the
processor,
if
you
take
this
vehicle,
i
am
warning
to
you
that
i
have
title
to
it
and
that
if
you
get
into
any
kinds
of
further
problems
with
the
prior
owner,
i
will
indemnify
you
and
hold
you
harmless.
and
that
of
course
is
an
incentive
to
the
processor
to
take
the
car
because
he
is
not
buying
a
lawsuit
–
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
your
honor.
and
that
brings
me
to
this
aspect
of
the
equal
protection
argument.
there
are
several
other
ways
in
which
title
can
pass
or
evidence
of
title
can
pass,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
and
i
think
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
in
alexandria’s
case
a
wrecker’s
certificate,
a
licensed
wreckers
certificate
is
the
second
most
prevalent
way
that
they
receive
vehicles.
indemnity
agreements
was
the
first,
a
second
was
a
wrecker’s
certificate,
which
is
a
document
obtained
from
motor
vehicle
administration
after
the
wrecker
has
established
a
motor
vehicle
administration
that
he
has
evidence
of
title.
that
becomes
a
titled
document
and
that
is
the
second
way
and
a
typical
way
that
a
wrecker
passed
its
title
to
a
processor.
and
of
course
one
of
the
arguments
here
is
that
the
processor
has
that
option
still
available
to
him.
and
before
i
break
on
this
point,
i
would
like
to
get
quickly
to
the
state’s
justification
for
this
amendment.
because
we
have
briefed
thoroughly
and
urged
this
court
to
accept
our
argument
that
blake
versus
mcclung
under
within
its
jurisdiction
point
justice
harlan’s
opinion
of
1898
stands
for
the
proposition
that
alexandria
simply
cannot
qualify
for
equal
protection
relief
because
it
does
not
do
business
in
maryland.
it
does
not
maintain
a
real
office
in
maryland,
the
only
office
is
the
home
of
its
president.
it
is
not
incorporated
in
maryland,
does
not
pay
taxes
in
maryland.
all
force
with
the
mcclung
case
and
that
case
remains
good
law
today.
it
is
been
cited
with
approval
several
times.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
fully
briefed.
now,
i
want
to
get
though
to
the
justifications
under
equal
protection
because
they
cut
just
as
much
towards
the
commerce
clause
argument
as
they
do
towards
the
equal
protection
argument.
maryland
wanted
to
do
several
things
with
this
amendment
in
1974.
first
of
all,
it
wanted
to
legitimize
a
haphazard
practice
with
respect
to
indemnity
agreements.
it
wanted
to
announce
the
principle
that
at
least
in
maryland,
indemnity
agreements
were
valid.
your
honors
know
that
there
is
a
split
of
authority
around
the
country
on
whether
indemnity
agreements
are
valid,
public
policy
documents,
they
are
for
these
purposes
in
maryland.
obviously,
we
can
affect
the
public
policy
of
virginia
or
pennsylvania
and
did
not
purport
to.
that
is
why
it
is
restricted
to
indemnity
agreements
in
maryland.
now,
it
is
interesting
too
that
there
are
five
other
out-of-state
processors
who
have
gained
the
benefits
over
the
years
of
the
maryland
program
but
only
one,
alexandria
has
brought
this
suit.
now,
the
reason
is,
the
other
processors
have
just
shifted
their
ground
and
it
have
obtained
vehicles
more
readily
under
the
wrecker’s
certificate
and
had
it
relied
on
indemnity
agreements.
this
i
think
illustrates
in
response
to
an
earlier
question
that
this
is
an
equal
possibility.
now,
a
second
reason—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
record
indicates
such
as
the
record
is
on
this
point
that
for
--
in
a
couple
of
specific
instances
attested
to
by
an
affidavit
of
a
mr.
giddleson(ph),
an
officer
of
alexandria
that
several
towers
have
not
delivered
the
quantity
of
vehicles
after
july
1,
1974
to
alexandria
that
they
delivered
prior
to
that.
but
the
record
also
shows
that
the
money
figures
are
unpersuasive
and
may
help
the
state,
there
is
no
loss
of
revenue
established,
further
establishes
however,
and
equally,
importantly
that
there
other
sources
of
vehicles
and
in
fact
those
sources
picked
up
after
in
alexandria’s
case
after
the
74
amendment.
the
second
justification
and
under
the
mcgowan,
dandridge,
and
san
antonio
school
district
cases,
these
justifications
are
clearly
satisfactory
are
that
owners
gain
additional
protection.
because
under
these
agreements,
an
owner
can
look
to
a
maryland
processor,
put
yourself
if
you
will
in
the
situation
of
an
owner
whose
vehicle
has
been
wrongfully
taken.
if
it
has
been
destroyed
by
an
out-of-state
processor
with
no
contacts
in
maryland,
not
subject
to
process
in
maryland
and
our
position
is
firmly
contrary
to
a
statement
in
the
district
court’s
opinion,
alexandria
is
not
subject
to
process
in
maryland
under
any
fair
reading
of
our
long
arm
statute
where
this
court
principles.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
what
i
am
saying
you—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
have
not
got
to
that
your
honor,
what
i
am
saying
right
now
for
a
maryland
resident
whose
been
wronged
--
whose
car
has
been
wrongfully
destroyed
in
virginia,
he
has
no
relief
in
the
maryland
courts
but
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
right.
that
is
possible
that
that
could
be
expanded
and
broadened
in
light
of
this
court
holdings
but
as
it
stands
now
he
would
have
to
go
to
virginia
to
get
relief.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right.
inoperable
of
course,
could
mean
a
that
a
part
or
two,
was
defective—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no,
without
an
engine
is
one
category,
otherwise
inoperable
is
a
second
category
and
that
could
simply
mean
that
--.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think,
we
have
discussed
that
before
our
argument.
that
may
be
pressing
it.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
but
if
it
needed
a
new
spark
plug,
i
think
it
would
be
inoperable.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
well,
i
guess
beauty
is
in
the
eye
of
beholder,
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
owner
is
entitled,
he
may
have
a
vehicle
that
he
has
been
holding
for
a
future
appreciation
in
his
mind
at
least.[laughter]
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
do
not
have
any
idea
your
honor.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
since
this
statute
has
been
in
effect
at
least
says
that
the
owner
can
go
against
the
maryland
processor
and
in
effect
there
is
a
second
string
to
his
bow.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
first
reason
is
the
legitimization
of
these
agreements
in
the
first
place,
only
in
maryland.
the
second
is—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
and
–
but
in—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
your
honor,
i
do
not
see
how
can
you
define
that
for
this
record
at
all.
the
simple
way
to—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
think
that
is
an
addition
of
justification,
your
honor.
it
is
but
i
think
it
raises
questions
that
is
simply
are
not
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
right.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
not
at
all,
i
think
all
we
have
to
show
under
equal
protection
is
that
there
are
rational
reasons
that
legislators
at
least
could
have
thought.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
third
reason
your
honor
is
that
there
is
a
tendency
to
have
bounty
payments
come
only
on
vehicles
abandoned
in
maryland
if
they
are
delivered
to
maryland
processors
under
indemnity
agreement.
remember
now,
the
weakest
possible
evidence
of
title
is
an
indemnity
agreement.
and
a
position
is
here
is
that
unlike
the
56
vehicles
that
the
state
apparently
wrongfully
paid
for
on
behalf
of
alexandria
scrap
which
were
turned
over
to
alexander
from
the
district
of
columbia
police.
if
maryland
processors
subject
to
maryland
jurisdiction
are
receiving
these
vehicles
under
indemnity
agreements.
there
is
a
greater
tendency
that
they
will
be
vehicles
abandoned
in
maryland.
now,
i
will
come
back
in
my
remaining
time
to
some
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
am.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
a
couple
of
minutes
remaining.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
am
talking
about
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
pick
up
a
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
stevens
relating
to
the
commerce
clause.
the
state’s
position
is
that
this
case
stands
alone
because,
first
of
all,
it
does
not
relate
to
a
milk
industry
as
all
the
other
cases
seem
to.
but
secondly
because
this
is
a
subsidy
program
established
by
the
state
of
maryland.
and
the
argument
presented
here,
i
think
is
unique
in
this
court,
namely
that
a
subsidy
program
established
by
the
state
that
has
yielded
enormous
sums
of
money
no
matter
how
split
up
that
money
has
been
at
the
whim
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
now
acclaims
that
its
receiving
less
than
it
was
receiving
before.
you
have
to
look
at
this
1974
amendment
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
1969
legislation
and
indeed
all
the
amendments
to
that
legislation
and
treated
as
if
everything
passed
at
one
time
and
then
apply
the
test
under
commerce
clause
and
equal
protection
to
it.
and
the
state
submits
that
the
statute
pass
its
muster
under
both
equal
protection
and
commerce
clause.
now,
also
under
the
commerce
clause
the
real
market
here
is
not
eight-year-old
hulks
abandoned
in
maryland,
entitled
in
maryland.
the
market
is,
in
the
anti-trust
sense,
scrap
that
is
the
commerce.
now,
there
is
no
burden
on
interstate
commerce
as
such
here.
there
is
an
alleged
burden
on
one
who
allegedly
participates
in
interstate
commerce
namely
the
plaintiff.
now,
pike
versus
bruce
church
company
is
a
perfect
case
in
point
to
illustrate
what
i
am
about
to
say.
that
leads
you
to
the
conclusion,
those
facts
lead
to
the
conclusion,
that
is
an
incidental
burden
which
is
permissible
we
submit
and
as
long
as
local
legitimate
public
interest
are
served,
this
dovetails,
the
equal
protection
arguments
and
the
commerce
clause
arguments
and
in
fact
if
you
want
to
see
large
industries
that
were
hit
in
the
pocket
book,
do
not
look
at
alexandria
scrap
because
they
have
not
established
it.
look
at
the
american
can
company
who
has
closed
up
its
washington
plant.
when
aragon
passed
the
law
that
says,
that
you
cannot
get
a
rebate
on
one-way
cans
anymore.
look
at
proctor
and
gamble,
this
case
cited
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
attacked
the
city
of
chicago’s
anti-phosphate
ordinance.
there
is
a
demonstrable
financial
loss
in
the
short
run
and
immediate.
it
is
not
demonstrated
in
this
record.
i
do
not
want
to
quarrel
with
this
record
because
what
is
before
the
court
is
in
effect
something—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
allegations
your
honor,
in
those
cases
were
that
they
were
discriminatory
because
the
court
found
otherwise
but
there
were
some
serious
allegations
because
of
the
distances
from
the
market,
that
for
instance
the
american
can
case
particularly,
you
simply
could
not
compete
effectively
in
that
market
because
you
are
too
far
away
from
it.
similar
secondary
arguments
were
raised
in
the
proctor
and
gamble
case,
there
was
a
secondary
effect
on
all
the
markets
outside
of
chicago.
court
found
that
that
did
not
present
a
commerce
clause
claim.
now,
i
do
want
to
say
something
about
this
point
of
the
office,
of
this
company
because
i
had
not
thought
it
would
become
so
important
but
it
has.
the
brief
states
that
the
office
of
alexandria
scrap
in
maryland
in
fact
is
on
ellsworth
drive
in
silver
spring
and
it
is
the
home
of
the
president.
they
do
not
even
call
it—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
three-judge
court
found
that
there
was
an
office
in
maryland
in
compliance
with
the
–
mr.
henry
r.
lord
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
want
to
come
to
right
now.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
they
certainly
did
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
certainly
think
you
can
your
honor
because—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
do
not
know
that
you
do
but
i
do
not
know
that
the
three-judge
court
reaches
out
and
takes
an
issue
that
was
never
argued
and
never
was
below.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
true.
but
it
is
not
a
fact-finding.
it
is
a
legal
finding
and
it
is
simply
wrong.
and
i
do
not
see
why
your
honors
cannot
review
that
fact
finding
the
way—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
i
mean
that
legal
findings,
sir.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
no
you
do
not
honor.
but
this
is
a
federal
court
interpreting
maryland
law
on
a
point
never
raised
and
tied
to
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
the
fact
that
very
ardently
below
alexandria
urged
and
it
is
all
over
the
record
below.
that
it
was
not
doing
business
in
maryland
and
this
ties
back
of
course
to
the—
mr.
henry
r.
lord
to
have
a
license
your
honor.
but
that
is
not
doing
a
business.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
the
license
shows
as
maryland
addressed
i
think,
the
silver
spring
address.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
that
is
what
--
mr.
henry
r.
lord
an
office
for
fourteenth
amendment
purposes
is
what
i
am
talking
about
here
doing
business
your
honor.
and
i
submit
that
this
simply
does
not
qualify.
that
is
the
one
alleged
contact
with
maryland.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
they
have
a
license
to
accept
money
in
virginia
from
the
bounty
program.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
not
to
do
business.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
license
is
in
the
record.
mr.
henry
r.
lord
they
are
an
out-of-state
processor
not
doing
business
in
maryland.
now,
what
i
started
to
say
before
is
that
the
court
below,
at
the
behest
of
the
court
below,
the
state’s
motion
for
dismissal
for
lack
of
a
substantial
federal
question
was
converted
into
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
state
sees
no
need
to
remand
this
case.
the
state
stands
now
as
it
did
then
on
that
motion
to
dismiss,
neither
of
the
two
constitutional
arguments
raised
by
the
plaintiff
will
survive
scrutiny.
thank
you.
