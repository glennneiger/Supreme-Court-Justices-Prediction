so
is
that
a
valid
distinction
between
the
deadline
of
cases
in
this
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
–
even
if
they
are
prohibitions.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
it
make
them
any
less
valid
precedent
in
your
favor
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
was
trying
to
shore
up
your
argument
a
little
bit.
let
me
go
back
to
a
factual
difference.
i
think
mr.
lord
says
that
this
bounty
is
fifty-fifty
and
you
say
its
–
but—
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
we
are
not
quibbling
about
facts
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
takes
his
1908
maxwell
before
alexandria
scrap
and
it
dies
at
your
front
door
and
you
take
it
over
and
there
is
not
any
antique
value
to
it,
who
gets
the
money?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
drove
it
up
and
it
dies
in
the
front
door--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
see.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
does
an
owner
who
thinks
that
he
had
his
car
stolen
illegally,
does
he
have
a
cause
of
action
on
the
indemnity
against
the
--
say
against
the
tower
who
picked
it
up?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
am
wondering
if
maryland
says
we
are
trying
to
put
--
among
other
things
with
this
rule,
we
are
trying
to
protect
an
owner
so
that
he
will
have
somebody
in
the
state
of
maryland
that
he
can
come
to.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
per
the
indemnity
agreement
runs
from
the
fellow
who
brought
it
in
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
to
the
processor.
