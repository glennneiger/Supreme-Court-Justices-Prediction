if
he
knew
you,
you
are
going
to
get
$16.00.
he
might
want
a
little
more
than
the
â€“
would
without
that.

and
what
it
does
then
is
to
immediately
exclude
from
the
market
just
for
economic
reasons.
there
is
no
formal
exclusion
but
for
economic
reasons
that
excludes
from
the
market
milk
producers
from
virginia.
justice

and
the
--

they
are
not
just
subsidized
and
the
milk
that
used
to
flow
into
maryland
from
virginia
dairy
farms
no
longer
flows
there
as
the
result
of
the
bounty,
so
called.

here
comes
the
virginia
milk
producer
in
and
saying,
this
law
burdens
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron

but
maryland
does
not
try
to
keep
them
out,
they
say,
send
it
all
in
--
you
just
have
to
compete
in
our
market,
that
is
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
think
you
have
good
and
nice
fresh
milk
and
if
you
want
to
sell
it
here,
sell
it.
justice
byron

maryland
and
virginia
fellows
says,
awfully
sorry,
i
cannot
compete
with
you.
justice

because
of
your
bounty.
justice

what
is
wrong
with
maryland
saying,
look
we
want
enough
automobile
processors
and
enough
people
who
will
process
these
cars.
we
want
enough
of
them
around
to
get
the
job
done.
and
to
make
sure
they
are
going
to
get
the
job
done,
we
are
going
to
give
them
a
little
bounty
if
as
long
they
have
got
plants
here
and
when
then
we
can
make
sure
they
are
going
to
get
the
job
done.
we
have
just
been
subsidizing
our
milk
farmers
and
we
know
how
much
it
were.
how
well
it
works.
so
we
are
going
to
make
sure
we
grow
up
enough
plants
inside
here
to
get
the
job
done.
and
we
are
not
just
going
to
give
it
to
any
body
else.

in
the
car
case.
justice
byron
r.

well,
the
state
could
do
it
in
the
milk
case
but
not
in
the
car
case.
