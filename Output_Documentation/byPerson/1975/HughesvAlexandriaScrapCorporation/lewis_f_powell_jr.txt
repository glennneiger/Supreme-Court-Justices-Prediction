justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
district
of
maryland.
the
appellee
owns
a
scrap
metal
processing
plant
in
alexandria,
virginia.
in
1917
maryland
adopted
a
program
to
clear
its
landscape,
have
abandon
automobile
hulks.
the
state
pay
its
vendors
for
the
delivery
of
the
hulks
to
processors.
appellee,
though
located
in
virginia,
participated
in
the
boundary
program.
the
maryland
legislature
amended
the
program
in
1974,
making
it
virtually
impossible
for
out
of
state
processors
to
continue
to
participate.
appellee
brought
this
suit,
alleging
that
the
1974
amendment
violated
the
commerce
clause
and
the
equal
protect
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
district
court
agreed
with
appellee
and
invalidated
the
amendment.
we
conclude
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today
that
the
amendment
neither
burdened
in
the
state
commerce
nor
denied
appellee
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
stevens
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
mr.
justice
brennan
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white,
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined.
