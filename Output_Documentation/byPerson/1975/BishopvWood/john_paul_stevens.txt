justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
a
former
policeman
for
the
city
of
marion,
north
carolina.
he
brought
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
north
carolina,
claiming
that
his
discharge
violated
his
constitutional
right
to
due
process
of
law,
because
the
city
did
not
grant
him
a
hearing
in
advance
of
his
discharge.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
complaint,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
fourteenth
amendment
provides
that
no
state
shall
deprive
a
person
of
property,
or
liberty
without
due
process
of
low.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
held,
that
under
north
carolina
law,
petitioner
“held
his
position
at
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
city.”
it
followed
that
his
discharge
did
not
deprive
him
of
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
further
held
that
the
discharge
did
not
deprive
petitioner
of
the
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
liberty.
in
this
court,
the
petitioner
makes
two
basic
arguments.
first,
he
contends
that
the
lower
courts
misconstrued
the
applicable
city
ordinance,
and
that
under
that
ordinance,
he
could
only
be
discharged
for
cause
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
he
did
have
a
property
interest
in
his
job.
we
reject
that
argument
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
customary
practice
of
accepting
the
answer
to
a
question
of
state
law
concurred
in
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
which
deal
more
regularly
with
such
questions
than
this
court.
even
though
as
an
original
proposition,
we
might
have
interpreted
the
city
ordinance
differently.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
petitioner
had
no
property
interest
in
his
employment.
second,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
discharge
created
a
stigma
on
his
reputation,
and
therefore
impaired
his
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
liberty.
we
reject
this
argument
essentially
for
two
reasons.
first,
recognizing
that
every
discharge
may
have
some
adverse
effect
on
an
employee's
ability
to
obtain
future
employment.
as
we
have
in
the
past,
we
conclude
that
this
fact
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
a
contrary
conclusion
would
authorize
federal
judicial
review
of
almost
every
personal
decision
made
by
a
public
employer.
second,
since
the
reasons
for
petitioner's
recharge
were
communicated
to
him
in
private,
we
reject
his
claim
that
his
reputation
was
thereby
stigmatized
even
if
we
assume
as
he
argues,
that
the
reasons
given
him
by
the
chief
of
police
were
false.
accordingly,
as
more
fully
explained
in
the
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr,
justice
marshall
joined.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
joined,
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joined.
