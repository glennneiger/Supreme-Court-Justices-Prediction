before
you
leave
that
point,
the
respondent’s
brief
cites
a
couple
of
north
carolina
cases
at
page
11
of
their
brief.
unknown
speaker
in
which
they
say
they
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
contract
is
terminable
at
will.
you
did
not
discuss
those
cases
in
your
reply
brief.
i
wonder
if
you
plan
to
discuss
today.
unknown
speaker
on
the
basis
the
statute
is
giving
your
plan
some
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
now,
that,
you
in
fact
read
into
the
language
that
you
read
to
us.
would
the
part
of
the
ordinance,
the
last
sentence
of
it,
that
you
did
not
read
to
us
rather
cast
in
some
question
what
you
read
between
the
lines
because
it
explicitly
says
what
a
discharged
employee
shall
be
entitled
to.
would
that
not
indicate
he
is
not
entitled
to
anything
else?
any
discharge
employee
shall
be
given
a
written
notice
of
his
discharge
setting
forth
the
effective
date
and
reasons
for
his
discharge
if
he
shall
request
such
a
notice.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event
or
only
if
requested
by
the--
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
petitioner’s
request?
unknown
speaker
be
it
public
record?
unknown
speaker
is
the
record
available
to
some
new
employer
if
he
sought
employment
after
his
discharge
here?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
prohibition
against
showing
it?
unknown
speaker
no
requirement
that
it
be
shown?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
while
i
have
you
interrupted.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
you
make
this
argument
as
a
reason
for
reversal
apart
from
the
finding
of
the
district
judge
that
he
was
not
a
permanent
employee
even
if
he
were
only
a
temporary
employee.
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
nature
of
the
reasons
given
at
his
request
why--
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
what
in
the
affidavit
do
you
contend
affected
his
liberty
interest?
unknown
speaker
arnett
v.
kennedy
have
cited
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
connection
with
the
en
banc
request?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
recall
the
oral
argument?
unknown
speaker
it
was
actually
argued.
unknown
speaker
it
was
actually
argued
and
you
think
arnett
was
or
was
not
cited?
unknown
speaker
it
cited
arnett
even
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
could
be
viewed
the
same
that
under
state
law,
even
if
you
could
only
be
fired
for
a
cause,
that
nevertheless
by
failing
to
provide
any
procedure
other
than
notice
and
reason
that
that
define
the
procedural
entitlement
of
the
employee.
unknown
speaker
and
that
under
state
law,
that
is
all
he
is
entitled
to.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
they
are
false
or
they
were
just
not
a
complete
statement
of
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
false?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
all
those
detailed
things
no
more
than
specific
ingredients
of
the
generic
reason
of
unsatisfactory
work?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
stigma
that
unsatisfactory
work
is
not.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
would
they
not
be
subsumed
under
the
generic
reason
of
unsatisfactory
work?
unknown
speaker
i
am
suggesting
only
that
perhaps
the
responses
were
not
mutually
inconsistent
but
one
was
just
a
little
particular,
so
to
speak,
and
the
other
was
a
more
generic
reason.
unknown
speaker
i
rather
thought
that
perry
and
roth,
it
was
perry
specifically,
that
held
that
if
government,
the
state
or
federal,
terminated
an
employee
upon
the
purported
ground
of
some
stigmatizing
reasons
such
as
you
are
being
fired
because
you
embezzled
money,
that
the
termination
upon
that
purported
and
publicized
ground
is
what
made
it
a
colorful
liberty
interests
and
that
what
entitled
that
employee
to
a
hearing
to
show
that
although
he
might
have
been
terminated
he
did
not
embezzle
the
money
but
here,
as
my
brother
rehnquist
suggests,
you
do
not
have
that
situation
to
describe.
you
do
not
have
a
termination
of
employment
upon
any
purported
stigmatizing
ground
according
to
your
own
submission.
unknown
speaker
and
at
that
point
that
you
brought
your
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
the
truth,
then
that
is
the
end
of
it.
the
only
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
to
show
that
it
is
not
true.
unknown
speaker
he
has
been
by
definition
under
sindermann
if
that
was
not
the
reason
given.
unknown
speaker
you
represent
these
two
individuals,
i
take
it.
you
are
their
attorney
nevertheless.
unknown
speaker
damages
would
be
measured
by
the
loss
of
pay.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
i
hope
you
are
going
to
save
sufficient
time
to
argue
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
would
it
apply
to
the
state
law
in
response
to
a
request
to
give
the
reasons
for
discharge,
the
city
said
they
did
not
have
any?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
could
be
fired
at
will
without
a
cause
at
all.
unknown
speaker
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
cannot
apply
it,
employees
maybe
fired
at
will?
unknown
speaker
what
if,
in
response
to
the
request
that
says
that
you
required
for
inefficiency.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
answer
was
you
were
fired
because
you
are
habitually
negligent?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
answer
to
the
claim
of
deprivation
of
liberty?
let
us
say
the
statute
provided
that
an
employee
could
be
discharged
only
on
the
basis
of
gross
dishonesty
or
immorality
and
let
us
assume
that
that
employee
was
terminated
on
the
basis
that
he
had
embezzled
some
money
and
that
would
be,
therefore,
grossly
dishonest.
that
would
be
unscrupulous
accord
with
the
statute
but
it
still
might
deprive
him
of
a
liberty
interest
that
would
entitle
him
to
a
hearing
to
see
whether
or
not
he
had
been.
in
other
words,
following
the
statute
does
not
really
fully
respond
to
a
claim
of
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
different
point?
unknown
speaker
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
if
in
the
judicial
proceeding
rather
than
as
the
police
chief
testified,
really,
we
discharged
him
because
of
embezzlement,
you
would
still
say
that
there
had
been
no
invasion
of
liberty
interest.
unknown
speaker
but
because
they
did
not
tell
him
the
truth
when
they
discharged
him
for
unsatisfactory
work.
unknown
speaker
i
am
putting
you
a
question,
a
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
they
gave
him
the
letter
they
gave
him.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
the
chief
testified
on
the
judicial
proceeding
that
that
was
not
the
reason,
the
real
reason
was
he
was
an
embezzler?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
rumors
around
town
that
he
had
embezzled
funds
then
the
police
chief
takes
hold
of
the
situation.
then
the
police
chief
discharges
him
with
a
letter
which
simply
says
he
is
discharged
for
unsatisfactory
work.
unknown
speaker
after
the
new
ordinance
was
passed,
his
termination
occurred,
was
it
10
months?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
his
rights,
his
situation,
is
different
from
that
of
a
person
employed
on
the
same
job
after
the
ordinance
was
passed
or
are
they
in
the
same
boat?
unknown
speaker
under
the
ordinance,
the
city
need
not
have
any
cause
for
discharge
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
judge
said
that
the
employee
may
be
discharged
at
will?
unknown
speaker
he
did
not
say
that
he
could
be
discharged
without
cause.
he
said
he
could
be
fired
at
will
and
could
mean
there
was
only
notice
without
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
without
notice.
unknown
speaker
if
the
judge
said
that,
why
are
we
here?
unknown
speaker
on
the
liberty.
