mr.
charles
e.
burgin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
begin
my
presentation
to
this
court
with
an
assumption.
i
am
here
in
behalf
of
the
city
of
marion
and
its
two
officials
who
were
sued
in
their
representative
capacities
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
under
the
amount
in
controversy
statute
28usc1331.
the
first
assumption
that
i
make
is
about
the
reply
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
has
now
conceded
that
the
city
cannot
be
reached
under
42usc1983
and
this
case.
the
second
concession
that
the
petitioners
made
in
this
reply
brief
is
that
the
state
of
the
record,
at
this
point,
is
not
sufficient
for
a
proper
determination
of
whether
or
not
jurisdiction
exists
under
28usc1331
and,
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
with
regard
to
those
two
matters,
and
i
shall
attempt
to
confine
my
discussion
of
the
case
to
other
portions
of
the
case.
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
bishop,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
hired
as
a
policeman
by
the
city
of
marion
in
june
of
1969.
at
the
time
he
was
hired,
there
was
no
personnel
ordinance.
this
personnel
ordinance
that
we
are
now
talking
about
was
adapted
on
april
4,
1970,
some-10
months
later.
the
petitioner
was
discharged
after
having
been
employed
for
two
years
and
ten
months.
he
was
discharged
on
march
31,
1972.
he,
then
after,
brought
suit
against
the
city
and
he
brought
suit
against
the
two
officials
in
their
representative
capacities.
now,
we
made
the
point
about
that
in
our
brief
and
we
have,
from
the
very
start
of
these
proceedings.
before
i
get
into
that,
i
have
the
permission
of
my
brother,
counsel
here
to
advise
the
court
of
two
more
facts.
the
chief
of
police,
one
of
the
respondents
of
this
case,
mr.
wood
was
disabled
by
a
stroke
and
is
no
longer
employed
by
the
city
of
marion.
he
seized
working
on
november
17,
1972.
the
other
respondent,
the
city
manager,
left
the
city
of
marion
on
november
30,
1972
and
has
taken
a
position
as
city
manager
with
another
city
in
north
carolina.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
we
have
contended
in
part
one
of
their
brief
that
because
this
suit
has
been
directed
against
the
municipality
and
against
two
of
its
officers
and
their
representative
capacities,
that
the
federal
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
under
42usc1983
by
its
jurisdictional
counterpart
28usc1343.
we
have
contended
throughout
and
we
do
still
contend
that
this
suit
is
not
only
informed
but
is
in
substance
against
the
city,
and
that
these
officials
who
are
named,
the
city
manager
and
the
chief
of
police,
are
named
only
in
a
nominal
capacities
as
representatives.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
that
they
were
the
agents
of
the
city,
your
honor,
they
carried
out
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance.
they
are
named
to
get
to
the
city.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
your
honor,
we
take
issue
with
that
point.
we
think
that
monetary
damages
are
not
sought.
the
chief
of
police,
your
honor,
with
the--
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
well,
the--
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
the
chief
of
police
and
the
city
manager.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
they
are
responsible
for
the
affidavits,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
they
are
responsible
for
firing
him
only
in
the
sense
that
they
were
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
as
only
the
city
could
have.
they
carried
out
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
which
was
their
duty
to
do
so.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
well--
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
for
the
lie?
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
no,
sir,
if
there
was
in
fact
a
liable
-
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
well,
the--
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
absolutely,
in
his
individual
capacity.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
he
is
not
in
this
case
in
his
individual
capacity.
your
honor,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
damages
against
these
individuals
as
individuals,
we
contend,
are
not
requested.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
no,
your
honor.
i
regard
that
as
a
prayer
for
back
wages.
i
think
that
the
petitioner
regards
it
thusly
also
because
in
his
brief,
and
we
have
put
this
in
our
brief
and
the
petitioner’s
brief.
on
page
6
of
petitioner’s
brief,
he
states
that
he
is
seeking
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
well
in
our
mind,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference.
back
pay
can
only
come
from
the
city.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
that
is
right
but
we
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
is
not
what
they
are
asking
for.
that
the
word
“damages”
is
not
controlling,
that
the
word
“back
pay”
is.
they
do
not
say
damages
in
form
of
back
pay.
they
say
damages
consisting
of
the
back
pay.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
get
to
the
merits
at
this
time.
i
simply
point
out
one
case
in
support
of
our
position
which
we
think
is
that
the
principles
enunciated
in
the
case
are
in
support
of
the
principles
which
i
have
just
stated
and
that
was
a
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1949,
larson
versus
domestic
foreign
commerce
corporation
in
337us682,
in
which
it
was
stated
that
the
actions
of
an
officer
if
not
in
conflict
with
the
terms
of
his
valid
statutory
authority
or
the
actions
of
the
sovereign.
with
regard
to
part
three
of
our
brief,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
policeman
had
a
property
interest,
we
start
with
the
premise
of
the
federal
district
court
which
we
think
is
a
correct
premise
that
the
respondents
complied
with
this
ordinance
and
applicable
state
law
in
discharging
mr.
bishop.
we
say
that
the
course
that--
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
i
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
i
think
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
that
was
the
meaning
and
the
intent
by
the
words
used
by
the
district
judge.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
inefficiency?
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
is
something
that
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
protected
constitutional
property
interest
and
it
is
something
that
should
be
handled
purely
and
simply
by
the
supervisor.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
i
still
say
that
that
has
no
more
implication
than
inefficiency.
if
your
honor
please,
i
know
you
alluded
to
that
weird
thing
in
the
arnett
case.
i
think
this
is
a
case
somewhat
like
that.
i
think
the
principles
would
apply
here.
i
think
you
also
alluded
in
the
arnett
case
to
an
1856
case
ex
parte
secombe
in
which
employment
was
conditioned
upon
maintaining
proper
respect
for
courts
and
court
officials.
and,
we
say
that
this
man
was
discharged
unsatisfactory
work.
satisfactory
work
would
be
on
a
par
with
satisfactory
respect
that
was
to
be
paid
to
someone.
mr.
bishop
has
maintained
throughout
this
proceeding,
as
i
understand,
his
contentions
that
he
had
a
property
interest
in
his
job
because,
number
one:
he
was
a
permanent
employee,
number
two:
that
during
the
entire
term
of
his
employment
no
other
policeman
on
a
17-man
police
force
had
been
discharged,
and
number
three:
because
he
reasonably
believed
that
he
would
not
be
discharged.
now
that,
i
understand
from
the
pleadings
in
the
case
and
from
the
briefs
that
they
have
filed,
is
his
position.
we
say
that
north
carolina
law
disposes
of
his
strongest
argument
in
that
respect,
his
strongest
argument
being
the
fact
that
he
was
a
permanent
employee.
our
law
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
holds
that
permanent
employment
without
more
means
nothing
more
than
an
indefinite
general
hiring
power
which
may
be
terminable
at
the
will
of
either
party
or
irrespective
quality
of
performance.
we
say
that
mr.
bishop
had
no
more
than
a
subjective
expectancy
that
he
would
continue
to
be
employed
and
that
that
is
not
protected
by
a
procedural
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
with
regard
to
the
liberty
interest,
we
have
maintained
that
the
statute
was
followed
and
the
district
court
judge,
on
page
15
of
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari,
states
there
is
no
contention
that
the
provisions
of
this
article
were
not
complied
with
by
the
defendant.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
i
concur
in
that
statement
completely
but
i
do
say
that
we
had,
in
discharging
him,
implicated
his
liberty
in
no
way.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
time
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
liberty
interest
is
implicated
is
at
the
time
of
his
discharge.
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
reasons
for
discharge
implicated
his
liberty
in
any
manner,
and
i
point
out
to
the
court
this
fact.
when
mr.
bishop
was
discharged
and
at
his
request,
he
was
given
a
letter
setting
forth
those
reasons.
now,
he
had
that
letter
in
his
possession
and
if
he
wanted
to
show
it
to
a
prospective
future
employer
he
very
well
could.
and
the
public
record
statute,
i
believe
mr.
jones’
statute
is
33,
would
give
any
prospective
future
employer
the
right
to
see
that.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
absolutely,
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
there
had
been
no
invasion
of
his
liberty.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
well,
your
honor,
respectfully
i
think
that
that
may
be
an
assumption.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
i
do
not
think,
if
your
honor
please,
number
one:
because
it
is
a
judicial
proceeding,
number
two:
because
it
would
have
been
brought
by
the
petitioner
that
the
liberty
interest
would
be
implicated
in
that
case.
i
think
the
liberty
interests
are
implicated
and
i
cannot
recall
but
i
believe
there
is
some
language
in
the
roth
case
or
sindermann
case
or
maybe
the
arnett
case
that
at
least
implies
that
the
time
of
discharge
is
what
is
important.
if,
at
that
time,
his
liberty
interest
were
implicated
that
is
one
thing.
in
this
case,
they
were
not.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
there
would
be
no
difference
in
that
hypothesis,
your
honor,
than
the
one
you
posed
earlier,
in
my
mind.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
about
two
years,
a
little
over
two
years.
the
ordinance
was
adapted
in
april
of
’70.
he
was
terminated
in
end
of
march
’72.
mr.
charles
e.
burgin
no,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
i
have
not
contend
that
below
this
court,
i
would
not
contend
that
mr.
bishop
is
not
a
permanent
employee
and
that
the
situation
would
be
the
same
with
regard
to
the
hypothesis
that
you
put
to
me,
if
the
two
individuals
had
passed
the
six-month
period.
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions
of
me,
that
would
conclude
my
presentation.
