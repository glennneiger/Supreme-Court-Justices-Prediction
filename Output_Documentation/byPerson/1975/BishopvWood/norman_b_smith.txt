mr.
norman
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
norman
smith
from
greensboro,
north
carolina,
the
counsel
for
petitioner
in
this
case.
petitioner
is
a
former
member
of
the
marion
north
carolina
municipal
police
force.
he
was
dismissed
on
march
31,
1972
after
nearly
three
years
of
uninterrupted
service
as
an
officer.
he
had
achieved
permanent
employee
status
after
successfully
completing
a
six-month
probationary
period.
certain
aspects
of
the
marion
personnel
ordinance
relate
to
discharge
procedure,
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment,
and
certain
reasons
were
given
to
mr.
bishop
for
his
discharge,
which
i
shall
also
discuss
presently.
this
suit
was
instituted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
north
carolina
alleging
wrongful
discharge
without
notice
and
hearing.
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
filed.
the
district
court
granted
the
respondent’s
motion.
the
matter
was
brought
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
where
a
2:1
carrying
panel
decision
was
in
the
respondent’s
favor
and
it
was
reheard
en
banc
and
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
this
petition
was
granted
and,
now,
the
case
is
here.
the
case,
we
think,
is
very
critical
and
that
it
involves
applications
of
principles
announced
by
this
court
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth
and
perry
v.
sindermann,
as
further
explicated
in
arnett
versus
kennedy.
first
of
all,
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
had
property
rights
grounded
in
statute
which
gave
rise
to
procedural--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
do
not
think
this
case
has
said
that
a
united
states
district
judge
is
a
court
of
last
resort
as
far
as
determining
what
state
law
is
and--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
record
is
before
the
court
and
we
submit
there
is
nothing
intuitive
about
north
carolina
law
that
it
is
written
and
whatever
it
applies
is
here
and
we
think
the
oral
court
is
manifestly
wrong
on
the
record
of
this
case.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
absolutely,
we
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
supports
his
conclusion
that
petitioner
held
his
position
at
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
city.
the
court
of
appeals
wrote
no
opinion
on
the
matter.
the
only
opinion
written
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
judge
winter’s,
in
my
judgment,
compelling
a
dissenting
opinion.
four
out
of
the
seven
judges
in
active
service
would
have
favored
my
position.
now,
the
statute
in
question--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
your
honor
will
please,
our
view
those
of
cases
as
having
to
do
with
private
employment
and
employment
in
the
absence
of
one;
a
personnel
ordinance,
such
as
we
have
here,
or
anything
analogous
to
it
in
the
way
of
contract
and,
two,
in
the
absence
of
a
fixed
probationary
period
with
a
maturation
into
a
permanent
employment
classification
and,
thus,
i
feel
the
cases
just
deal
with
a
common
law
of
employment
in
the
absence
of
agreement
and
ordinance
to
the
contrary
and
are
not
controlled.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
primarily,
yes,
sir.
the
statute
and
practices
of
the
city.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
your
honor
please,
the
dissenting
opinion
was
produced
by
judge
winter
when
there
was
a
hearing
panel
of
three.
no
opinion
came
out
of
the
4:4
decision.
we
assume
that
senior
judge
bryan
was
consistent.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
presume
so.
nonetheless,
i
think
judge
winter’s
opinion
is
very
persuasive
simply
because
of
judge
winter’s
reasoning
and
i
think
that
it
should
be
regarded
by
the
court
as
being
correct.
the
ordinance
in
question,
it
is
very
brief
and
i
thought
i
would
read
it.
a
permanent
employee
whose
work
is
not
satisfactory
over
a
period
of
time
shall
be
notified
in
what
way
his
work
is
deficient
and
what
he
must
do
if
the
work
is
to
be
satisfactory.
if
a
permanent
employee
fails
to
perform
up
to
the
standard
of
the
classification
held
or
continues
to
be
negligent,
inefficient,
or
unfit
to
perform
his
duties,
he
may
be
dismissed
by
the
city
manager.
to
us,
it
is
very
clear
that
this
ordinance
establishes
four
causes
for
dismissal.
one:
work
not
up
to
standard,
two:
negligence,
three:
inefficiency,
four:
unfitness
for
duty.
and,
next,
we
think
it
is
very
clear
that
this
ordinance
establishes
certain
prerequisites
to
dismiss
procedural
prerequisites.
one,
that
there
must
be
a
notification
of
the
deficiency
and,
two,
a
continuance
of
the
performance
in
a
deficient
manner
and,
three,
a
statement
of
explanation.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
correct,
sir.
we
think
that
is
an
additional
procedure
that
has
to
be
undergone
and
i
will
undertake
to
discuss
in
a
moment.
i
could
now,
if
the
court
wished.
why
we
feel
that
the
very
minimal
procedures
set
forth
in
section
6
are
not
binding
in
the
determination
of
the
substantive
rights
that
are
created
by
that
section.
i
feel
that,
at
least
the
six
justices
of
this
court
in
the
arnett
case
would
so
hold.
now,
the
respondent
concedes
at
page
10
in
their
brief
that
the
ordinance
is
mandatory
as
to
notification.
this
concession
is
very
important.
they
say
it
is
mandatory
as
to
notification
of
a
deficiency
in
performance.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
police
discharge
notice.
i
think,
i
am
interpreting
the
respondent’s
brief
correctly.
on
page
10,
first
sentence,
“although
the
ordinance
is
mandatory
with
respect
to
notifying
employees
of
areas
of
deficient
performance,
it
is
merely
permissive
as
to
their
dismissal
for
failure
to
perform.”
so,
the
mandatory
provision
conceded
by
the
respondents
is
that
requiring
the
pre-discharge
notice.
in
other
words,
the
notice
that
must
be
followed
by
an
opportunity
to
reform
and
demand
one’s
conduct.
the
district
court
assumed,
on
15
of
the
certiorari
petition
opinion,
that
the
ordinance
had
been
fully
complied
with.
of
course,
we
think
that
assumption
is
manifestly
incorrect
for
reasons
which
we
will
state
in
a
moment.
but
once
it
is
established
by
the
concession
made
by
the
respondents
and
by
the
assumption
of
the
district
court
that
it
is
necessary
to
comply
with
certain
procedures
before
terminating
a
public
employee’s
employment
then
we
think
the
property
rights
are
confirmed.
the
property
rights
that
bring
due
process
considerations
into
play
are
confirmed.
we
have
an
alternative
argument
which
i
will
rely
upon
the
briefs
and
will
not
take
the
court’s
time.
the
fact
alone
that
this
employee
was
classified
as
a
permanent
employee
after
six
months
probationary
service,
that,
alone
we
feel
gave
him
a
property
right
to
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
liberty
interest
that
we
feel
are
identified
in
this
case
in
which
we
think
provide
an
equally
alternative
basis
for
procedural
due
process
requirements.
at
the
time
of
the
discharge,
the
chief
and
the
city
manager
refused
to
discuss
their
reasons
with
petitioner
as
to
why
he
was
being
let
go.
later,
upon
request
and
in
accordance
with
the
ordinance
that
we
have
cited,
a
written
statement
of
reasons
was
furnished
stating
that
petitioner’s
work
had
been
unsatisfactory
and
that
he
had
refused
to
attend
certain
schools.
of
course,
the
petitioner
takes
exception
to
these
and
says
that
these
statements
are
false.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
was
furnished
privately
in
a
letter,
if
your
honor
please.
the
ordinance
says
that
one
may
ask
for
written
reasons
and
the
petitioner
did
so
and
they
were
furnished.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
later
on
when--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
under
north
carolina
law,
i
am
inclined
to
think
they
would.
we
have
a
very
broad
public
records
statute
which
is
not
mentioned
in
the
brief
but
it
has
only
very
narrow
exceptions
and,
without
going
back
and
reading
it,
my
inclination
would
be
to
say
that,
yes,
this
would
be
a
matter
of
public
record.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
certainly.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
none
whatever.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no
requirement
that
it
be
shown
except
pursuant
to
our
public
records
law
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
would
be
available.
the
public
records
law
is
very
explicit
and
quite
simple
and
quite
short,
and
i
am
just
sorry
i
do
not
have
the
citation
in
my
mind.
it
is
relevant
but
it,
some
way
or
another,
did
not
get
into
the
briefs.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
precisely,
even
if
he
were
only
probationary
or
temporary
or
did
not
have
any
property
interest,
clearly,
if
his
liberty
interest
was
of
a
constitutional
magnitude,
he
would
be
entitled
to
procedural
due
process.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well
the
initial
reasons,
no,
your
honor.
the
initial
reasons
are
not,
i
think,
of
the
kind
that
would
require
that
unsatisfactory
work,
refusal
to
attend
schools.
at
least,
i
do
not
argue
that
they
are
sufficient.
perhaps
some
would,
but
later
when
this
action
was
brought
in
district
court,
the
chief
of
police
under
oath,
by
affidavit,
gave
his
real
reasons
for
discharging
petitioner.
these
were
much
more
serious
and
did
implicate
the
liberty
interest
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
was
only
then
that
it
became
disclosed
to
us,
but
we
must
assume
that
the
chief
of
police
was
telling
the
truth
under
oath
when
he
filed
his
affidavit
and
we
must
further
assume
that
he
has
extra
judicial
statement
not
under
oath
was
false,
or
else
he
would
have
been
committing
perjury.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
whenever
one
reasonably
suspects
that
his
liberty
interest
have
been
violated,
he
can
go
to
court
and
ask
the
person
who
fired
him,
under
oath,
to
say
what
the
reasons
were.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well
in
response
to
that,
your
honor,
it
is
well
known
that
a
lot
of
times
employers
will
not
be
candid
with
employees
to
their
face
and
say
the
reasons
but
it
must
be
assumed,
i
think,
that
for
prospective
employers
and
others
who
inquired
about
petitioner’s
conduct
i
think
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
chief
would
have
given
these
real
reasons.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
sir,
there
is
none.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
it
could
be
argued
there
that
it
did,
but
in
canter,
i
am
not
satisfied
that
it
did.
it
said
unsatisfactory
work
and
refusal
to
attend
schools.
i
am
hesitant
to
say
that
that
rises
to
a
liberty
interest.
of
course,
i
would
not
argue
with
a
majority
of
this
court
if
they
would
have
not
thought
otherwise
because
that
would
be
a
very
favorable
result,
but
i
am
unable
to
argue
that
in
good
conscience.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
there
were
four
things:
disobedience
of
orders,
insubordination,
causing
low
morale,
and
engaging
in
conduct
unsuited
to
an
officer.
these
are
on
pages
32-34
of
the
appendix.
and
these
of
course,
i
think,
clearly
rise
to
the
level
of
liberty
interest.
you
are
saying
that
a
person
is
deliberately
disobedient.
he
is
insubordinate.
he
is
causing
low
morality
and
engaging
whatever
it
is
in
conduct
unsuitable
to
an
officer
has
a
certain
moral
tinge
to
it,
i
think.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
terribly
unjust
to
allow
the
earlier
and
now
admittedly
false
reasons
to
control.
i
think
the
true
reasons
ought
to
control
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
assumed
that
prospective
employers
and
others
who
inquired
were
given
the
true
reasons--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
there
is
no
evidence.
of
course,
this
case
comes
up
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
and,
presumably,
if
we
go
to
trial
this
is
one
of
the
issues
that
would
be
explored.
clearly,
it
is
a
relevant
and
an
important
issue.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
we
engaged
in
very
limited
discovery
and,
i
must
say,
that
is
one
line
of
discovery
i
did
not
pursue.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
i
concede
that
neither
i
or
any
other
lawyer
can
think
of
everything
in
order
to
be
thought
of
at
the
trial
level
and
i
feel
that
there
are
ample
reasons
for
remanding
this
case
for
a
determination
on
the
merits
and
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
would
come
out
in
the
end.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
arnett
case
i
believe,
your
honor,
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time
en
banc
consideration
was
granted.
it
had
just
been
decided
when
we
argued
the
case
en
banc.
it
was
not
cited,
as
i
recall,
in
either
of
the
briefs.
i
do
recall--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
do
recall
judge
russell
asking
some
questions
about
the
arnett
case
and
i
do
recall
that
i
was
not,
at
that
time,
very
able
to
deal
with
his
questions
because
the
case
was
very
new.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
right,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
it
was.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
arnett
was
cited
in
oral
argument.
the
record
would
not
show
that
but
the
recordings
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
fourth
circuit
would.
it
was
discussed
in
oral
argument.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
my
memory
is
in,
but
if
your
honor
says
so,
i
assume
it
is
great.
of
course,
we
did
rely
on
arnett
in
our
brief.
i
do
feel
that
this
clearly
comes
under
roth
and
sindermann,
and
that
is
the
reason
we
are
here.
i
think
that
those
cases
should
control
the
outcome
of
this
case.
now,
as
to
whether
a
mere
--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
do
you
think
that
stands
under
arnett.
according
to
your
honor’s
opinion,
six
members
of
the
arnett
court
and
i
suppose
five
members
of
this
court
would
hold
that
once
the
property
or
liberty
interest
is
defined
by
state
law
that
the
procedural
requirements
are
constitutionally
defined
and
are
not
defined
by
state
law.
that
is
my
reading
of
the
opinions
in
arnett,
and
we
feel
quite
strongly
that
this
is
so
that
while
state
law,
of
course,
creates
certain
rights,
it
is
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process
clause
that
determines
how
these
rights
will
be
adjudicated
and
how
they
will
be
determined
in
the
administrative
process.
so,
we
say
that
the
full
range
of
rights
from
goldberg
versus
kelly
and
other
cases,
in
other
words,
a
trial
type
hearing
is
what
is
required
once
the
liberty
and
property
interest
of
constitutional
magnitude
are
identified.
the
respondents
have
shown
no
pressing
circumstances
such
as
those
present
in
a
prison
disciplinary
situation
or
a
public
high
school
disciplinary
situation
that
would
require
any
truncating
of
the
due
process
requirements
or
any
shrinkage
of
it.
we
think
that
there
is
ample
time
and
proper
place
when
an
employee
is
to
be
deprived
of
a
job
to
which
he
has
a
fourteenth
amendment
entitlement.
we
think
there
is
time
and
place
for
a
due
process
hearing
to
be
held.
clearly,
this
was
not
done
in
the
present
case.
now,
even
if
one
were
to
look
at
the
plurality
opinion
in
arnett
and
take
the
position
that
whatever
source
of
the
property
interest
at
stake,
that
should
also
be
the
source
for
the
procedural
requirements
even
if
one
were
to
take
that
view,
a
view
which
i
submit
cannot
be
taken,
still
the
respondents
are
deficient
and
were
in
violation
of
petitioner’s
rights.
in
the
first
place,
he
was
never
notified
of
any
deficiency
in
his
work,
at
least
on
summary
judgment
that
must
be
taken
because
that
was
petitioner’s
evidence,
although
it
was
in
dispute.
secondly,
the
written
statement
did
not
contain
the
true
reasons
for
discharge.
they
contained
false
reasons.
so,
we
feel
that
the
very
procedures
outlined
by
the
ordinance
were
not
adhered
to
and
clearly--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it
would
be--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
would
be
charitable
to
say
that
they
were
not
complete,
if
one
asked
for
a
list
of
all
reasons
that
he
is
terminated
and
he
is
told
that
he
is
terminated
because
of
unsatisfactory
work
and
refusal
to
attend
schools,
and
later
on
he
finds
out
that
he
has
been
terminated
for
all
these
things
that
implicate
his
morals
and
his--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
one
can
be
terminated
for
unsatisfactory
work
and
get
along
and
it
probably
does
not
give
rise
to
a
liberty
interest,
but
if
the
unsatisfactory
work
consists
of
deliberate
refusals
to
obey,
or
insubordination,
hostility,
all
of
these
sorts
of
things--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
precisely.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it
is
conceivable.
i
view
them
as
being
a
change
of
approach
and
i
view
them
as
the
police
chief
coming
out
with
the
real
reasons
and
reasons
which
are
basically
inconsistent
with
those
first
disclosed,
but
they
could
be
regarded
as--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
so,
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
such
a
material
difference
makes
it
clearly
incomplete
and,
in
my
view,
false.
i
do
not
think
the
falsity
of
the
first
set
is
necessary.
i
think
the
incompleteness
suffices,
if
those
reasons
which
were
not
disclosed
are
liberty-implicating
reasons
or
reasons
which
carry
stigma
and
tend
to
degrade
the
petitioner’s
good
name,
reputation,
and
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
i
think
if
the
real
reasons
are
stigmatizing
that
that
brings
the
right
to
a
hearing
into
play,
i
do
not
think
that
the
employer
should
be
allowed
to
benefit
or
to
be
shielded
as
a
result
of
either
his
falsehood
or
his
inaccuracy
of
his
first
description.
i
think
that
is
manifesting
unfairly.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
certainly
believe
that,
your
honor
and
i
think
whenever
and
however
it
comes
out,
if
it
comes
out
in
such
a
way
as
to
come
within
the
test
set
up
in
perry
and
roth,
i
think
he
needs
to
be
accorded
his
rights.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
you
have
an
employer
who
is
covering
up
and--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
when
you
have
employer
who
is
covering
up
and
concealing
the
truth
and
you
think
he
is
and
you
bring
him
into
court
and
you
get
him
to
tell
the
truth,
i
think
you
ought
to
be
able
to
benefit
by
whatever
the
truth
is.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
am
talking
about
the
true
state
of
the
employer’s
mind,
the
true
reasons
the
employer
had,
and
of
course,
the
due
process
hearing
would
determine
whether
they
are
in
fact
true,
and
we
most
emphatically
deny
that
any
of
these
charges
are
true
as
is
set
forth
in
the
record.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
he
feels
he
is
being
terminated
because
of
his
liberty
interest,
i
submit
that
that
is
a
perfectly
valid
reason
for
him
to
go
to
court.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
he
thinks
that
is,
although
that
is
the
reason,
it
is
not
but
why
should
he
not
be
permitted
to
go
into
court
and
have
the
parties
tell
the
truth
about
the
situation.
i
feel
that
it
would
be
just
unjust
to
hold
that.
one
should
not
be
bound
by
what
he
says
is
the
truth
in
court.
i
see
my
time
is
almost
run
out
and
i
will
save
whatever
remaining
time
i
have
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
thank
you.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
your
honor
please,
i
did
save
some
time
but
i
have
no
particular
comment
i
wish
to
make.
i
think
i
have
covered
the
points
in
the
opening
argument
unless
there
are
any
remaining
questions.
we
thank
the
court.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
just
think
he
is
plain
wrong.
i
think
you
can
look
at
the
ordinance
and
see
that
you
have
to
fall
into
one
of
four
categories
before
you
can
be
discharged.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
judge
is
just
wrong.
he
is
not
reading
the
statue
or
not
reading
it
correctly,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
any
way--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
presume
that
with
“at
will”
and
“without
cause”
is
the
same
thing.
it
would
be
wrong
to
think
that
one
had
to
have
cause
to
discharge
someone
and
then
say
you
can
do
it
at
will
anyway.
that
would
negate
the
force
of
the
cause.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
suppose
that
is
a
possible
construction
but
none
of
this
ordinance.
anyway
you
turn
this
ordinance
it
says
that
there
must
be
one
of--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
your
honor,
i
respectfully
contend
he
is
wrong
and
that
judge
winter
is
right
that
this
court
ought
to
reverse.
work
not
up
to
standard,
negligence,
inefficiency
or
unfitness
have
to
exist.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
if
you
agreed
with
everything
he
said
in
that
opinion,
i
would
lose
but--
mr.
norman
b.
smith
he
said
that
the
liberty
interests
were
not
implicated.
he
covered
the
whole
thing.
he
just
did
not
do
it
right.
