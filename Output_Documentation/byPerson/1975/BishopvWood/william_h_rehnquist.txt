justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smith,
let
me
call
your
attention
on
page
19
of
your
petition
for
certiorari,
a
part
of
judge
jones’
opinion
in
the
district
court
where
he
says
in
about
the
third
paragraph
on
that
page
that
the
page,
that
one
little
sentence
paragraph.
“it
further
appears
that
the
plaintiff
held
his
position
at
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
city.”
i
read
that
as
an
interpretation
of
local
ordinance
and
the
state
law
that
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
how
do
you
get
around
that
in
view
of
the
language
in
roth
and
perry
that
these
kinds
of
things
arise
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
are
regulated
by
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
here,
you
have
got
the
district
judge
in
north
carolina
who
is
presumably
a
north
carolina
practitioner
before
he
took
the
bench.
you
have
got
a
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
deals
with
north
carolina
who
are
all
much
more
regulated
than
we
do.
are
you
asking
us
to
second
guess
those
two
courts
on
what
carolina
law
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
do
want
us
to
reach
a
contrary
result
on
the
question
of
north
carolina
law
as
to
that
reached
by
judge
jones?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
furnished
to
petitioner
in
private,
more
or
less,
just
by
a
letter
or
was
it
publicly
announced?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
was
only
at
that
stage,
you
say,
that
the
liberty
interest
was
implicated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
that
leaves
you
in
this
position.
there
was
nothing
implicated
of
liberty
interest
at
the
time
of
the
discharge
or
even
in
response
to
petitioner’s
request
for
a
letter.
it
was
only
when
you
sued
them
that
this
came
out
as
a
legal
defense
in
their
eyes.
do
you
think
that
is
in
the
same
posture
as
if
they
had
simply
announced
it
without
any
lawsuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
your
liberty
interest
has
not
been
violated
at
the
time
you
file
a
lawsuit
and
the
violation
occurs
only
as
a
result
of
another
party’s
pleading
to
the
lawsuit
that
you
brought
against
him,
do
you
think
that
is
on
the
same
pleading
as
if
they
publicly
announced
it
at
the
time
of
discharge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there
any
evidence
that
he
did,
in
fact,
give
them
to
anybody
else
before
the
lawsuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
prospective
employer
did
inquire,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
have
an
opportunity
to
do
any
discovery?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
not
supposed
to
think
about
it
at
the
time
it
is
in
the
district
court
rather
than
the
time
it
is
up
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
reheard
en
banc,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
your
theory,
supposing
you
have
a
sindermann
type
case,
where
the
plaintiff
sues
claiming
a
guarantee
of
some
sort
of
tenure
plus
a
deprivation
of
first
amendment
rights.
he
was
fired
for
reason
impermissible
under
first
amendment,
and
no
reason
is
ever
furnished
at
all
for
his
discharge.
he
is
simply
discharged
and
nothing
more
is
said.
and
then
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
of
the
case,
in
order
to
rebut
the
first
amendment
argument
made
by
the
plaintiff,
the
respondent
employer
sets
forth
the
real
reasons
that
he
discharged
you
which
had
not
been
made
known
to
anybody
up
to
now.
do
you
think
that
at
point,
the
employee
has
an
additional
claim
based
on
a
deprivation
of
a
liberty
interest
because
some
of
the
respondents
followed
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
never
would
have
come
out
unless
the
employee
had
brought
a
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
motive
does
an
employee
have,
he
was
given
no
reason
for
his
discharge,
to
sue
his
employer
in
order
to
induce
his
employer
to
libel,
really
which
is
what
you
are
saying
that
he
is
doing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
nominal
capacity
as
representatives?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
you
take
monroe
against
pape,
a
case
like
that
where
they
held
you
could
not
recover
against
the
city
of
chicago,
this
court
held.
you
could,
i
take
it,
recover
against
the
individual
policeman
in
that
case.
i
would
think
in
your
case,
although
you
could
recover
against
the
city,
you
could
recover
against
the
named
individuals
if
they
were
city
officials.
monetary
damages
are
sought,
as
i
understand
the
complaint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
burgin,
in
judge
jones’
opinion
on
page
12
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
first
paragraph
of
his
opinion
says,
referring
to
the
petitioner,
he
seeks
an
order
requiring
the
defendant
to
reemploy
him
and
a
monetary
award
of
damages
consisting
of
his
wages
from
march
31
’72
to
the
date
of
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
you
not
regard
that
as
a
prayer
for
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
back
pay
or
back
wages
and
damages
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
may
be
true
but
judge
jones
opinion
talks
about
damages,
as
i
take
it,
if
one
of
the
individual
defendants
in
this
case
wrongfully
and
unconstitutionally
fired
the
petitioner
he
might
be
liable
for
damages
even
though
he,
not
being
the
city,
could
not
pay
“wages.”
