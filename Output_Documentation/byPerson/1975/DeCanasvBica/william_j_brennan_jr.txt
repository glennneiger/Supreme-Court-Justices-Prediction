(inaudible)
is
whether
is
this
field
has
been
preempted
by
federal
legislations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
federal
statute
to
impose
a
penalty
for
knowingly
employ
an
alien,
(inaudible)
could
that
ever
pass?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
does
it
stand
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it
is
still
a
live
effort,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
would
have
passed,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
(inaudible)
appellate
courts
has
held
as
this
one
did,
this
is
the
second
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
held
that
2805
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
california
supreme
court
refused
to
review
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william

(inaudible)
turn
to
page
four
of
the
solicitor
generalâ€™s
memorandum,
you
notice
that
footnote
4,
this
is
addressed
to
your
argument
based
on
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act,
he
says
while
that
act,
the
farm
act
contemplates
some
limited
room
for
state
laws.
the
state
law
must
be
approachable
and
2805
is
not
wholly
in
accord
with
federal
policy
and
thus
not
appropriate.
i
gather
that
is
an
attempted
answer
to
your
proposition
that
since
congress
already
said,
the
states
may
operate
in
the
field
of
farm
labor,
then
that
must
also
be
an
expression
of
congressional
intent
that
states
may
operate
generally
in
the
field
of
all
aliens,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
205
want
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
mean
shaped
for
us
that
we
--
whether
we
agree
with
you
that
has
not
been
an
occupancy
in
the
field
and
there
is
room
for
state
regulation.
is
the
record
sufficient
so
that
we
can
decide
whether
in
fact
the
state
law
in
conflict?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
first
of
these
two
cases
i
might
say
preliminary
that
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
either
of
these
cases.
in
the
first
de
canas
v.
bica,
which
is
here
from
an
intermediate
appellate
court
of
appeal
in
california,
section
2805
(a)
of
the
california
labor
code
prohibits
a
california
employer
from
knowingly
employing
an
alien
who
was
not
entitled
the
lawful
residence
in
the
united
states
if
the
aliens
employment
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
lawful
california
resident
workers.
our
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
reverses
the
holding
of
the
california
courts
that
that
statute
is
unconstitutional,
either
as
an
impermissible
regulation
of
immigration,
a
subject
exclusively
reserved
to
the
congress
for
regulation,
or
as
being
preempted
under
the
supremacy
clause
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
