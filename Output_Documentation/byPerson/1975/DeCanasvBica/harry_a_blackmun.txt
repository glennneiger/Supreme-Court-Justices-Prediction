response
to
my
brother
stewart
that
this
is
congruent
in
its
application
with
the
federal
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mean
that
is
the
schedule
a,
is
it
in
the
29
cfr?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
specifically
then
it
is
congruent
with
the
labor
department
regulations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
was--
no
particular
federal
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
gather
that
you
are
relying,
if
i
read
your
brief
correctly,
rather
heavily
on
what
was
done
in
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act,
even
though
that
is
limited
only
to
farm
labor
since
that
expressly
says
that
it
is
intended
to
supplement
the
state
action.
if
that
itself
is
evidence,
have
express,
explicit
on
the
part
of
congress,
then
that
in
this
whole
field
state
regulation
was
permissible?
justice

state
of
california
may
do
so?mr.
