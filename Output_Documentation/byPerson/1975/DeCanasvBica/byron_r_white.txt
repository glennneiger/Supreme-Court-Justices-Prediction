justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
a
federal
provision
with
respect
to
the
employment
of
illegal
aliens?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
let
us
suppose
you
are
talking
in
the
area
of
farm
labor
and
the
same
issue
came
up,
do
you
think
the
state
--
what
if
the
california
law
were
just
limit
it
to
farm
labors?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
but
--
now
you
would
argue
that
if
the
california
law
were
limited
to
the
farm
labor
situation,
there
would
be
no
preemption
because
the
federal
law
dealing
with
the
same
subject
matter
expressly
saves
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
would
be
effective
despite
the
immigration
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
not
think
that
is
somewhat
persuasive
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
california
law
in
it
is
entirety,
with
respect
to
the
intention
of
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
goes
some
direction
towards
--
conceding
that
there
is
no
overall
preempts
in
just
from
the
existence
of
the
â€“
of
an
un-exercised
federal
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
believe
i
understand
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
asserted
in
this
case
that
the
state
law
even
if
there
is
no
overall
(inaudible)
on
the
federal
power
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
state
law
and
federal
law,
an
actual
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
occupation,
you
mean
federal
occupation
of
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
--
if
the
state
court
did
not
really
reach
the
question
which
you
suggest
they
did
not,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
we
would
not
know
precisely
what
the
state
law
reaches
or
what
it
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
state
laws
are
(inaudible)
separable
or
invalid
the
--
in
part
it
might
be
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
california
law
at
issue
here
--
it
covers
farms
as
well
as
industrial
labor?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
were
in
so
--
if
it
--
let
us
assume
that
if
it
were
just
a
farm
labor
law
it
would
be
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
assume
that
it
was,
could
this
law
be
upheld
insofar
as
it
applied
to
farm
labor?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you
and
with
the
lower
court
with
respect
to
the
general
preemption
or
occupation
ground,
are
you
urging
us
here
to
sustain
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
there
is
an
actual
conflict
between
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
lower
court
did
not
decide
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
does
not
violate
it
unless
he
knows
that
the
man
is
here
illegally?
i
mean,
he
knows
when
he
hires
him,
but
he
also
must
know
that
he
is
violating
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there
was
a
conflict
law
and
i
am
not
sure
there
is.
what
about
the
civil
remedy
under
the
california
statute?
there
is
one
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
do
not
see
any
preclusion
of
the
civil
remedy,
do
you?
