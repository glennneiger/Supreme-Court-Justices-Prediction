mr.
william
s.
marrs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
respondents’
position
that
2805
of
the
labor
code
is
unconstitutional
on
three
grounds.
the
first
is
that
it
deals
with
foreign
affairs
and
immigrations
and
which
is
a
subject
of
such
down
the
federal
concern,
that
states
are
precluding
from
legislating
in
that
area.
clearly,
2805
will
discriminate
against
the
nationals
and
the
foreign
sovereign.
this
may
be
a
subject
which
congress
may
want
to
do,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
it
is
not
up
to
the
state
of
california
to
take
that
in
their
hands.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
in
the
case
of
farm
labor,
2805
applies
to
all
employers.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
it
is
separable
as
to
farm
labor
only?
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
would
disagree
with
that
because
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
if
2805
applied
only
to
farm
labor,
i
would
say
that
it
could
not
be
upheld
because
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act
took
into
account
the
state
scheme,
but
that
was
as
far
as
the
safety
and
the
health
standards.
there
are
some
12,
i
believe
states
who
already
have
laws
regulating
farm
labor
contractors
and
as
far
as
the
health
and
the
safety
of
the
employees
and
i
believe
that
is
what
that
was
after
and
not
that
they
had
passed
laws
regulating
the
employment
of
illegal
aliens
and
they
were
just
inviting
them
to
do
that.
2805
also
controls
immigration
rather
than
just
being
a
labor
law.
first
of
all
the
so-called
illegal
aliens
will
be
unable
to
secure
employment
in
the
state
of
california
and
those
that
are
working
will
be
terminated.
there
is
also
a
group
of
aliens
that
are
not
entitled
to
lawful
residents,
but
who
are
able
to
work
under
the
federal
scheme
who
would
not
be
entitled
under
2805.
now,
petitioners
put
much
reliance
on
the
regulations
that
--
which
try
to
save
2805.
those
regulations
were
adopted
three
days
after
a
superior
court
judge
in
los
angeles
declared
2805
unconstitutional
in
the
dolores
canning
case
which
was
the
other
appellate
case
and
they
were
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
will
get
to
those.
it
is
going
to
regulate
those
also.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
am
sure
they
were
and
i
also
think
that
if
this
court
upholds
2085,
a
labor
commissioner
could
rescind
those
regulations
and
we
are
right
back
to
the
statute
again
with
no
regulations.
so
then
we
have
what
is
an
adverse
effect,
who
is
entitled
to
lawful
residence.
the
regulations
are
not
embodied
in
stone.
also
in
california
particularly
there
is
a
problem
with
illegal
aliens
who
have
come
across
into
california,
particularly
in
southern
california
who
have
got
jobs,
have
families,
married
and
had
families
and
they
are
protected
from
deportation
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
but
they
are
not
given
a
document
by
the
immigration
authority
to
--
that
they
can
work
or
anything
and
if
this
was
enforced,
those
people
while
they
are
trying
to
get
their
status
adjusted
from
illegal
alien
to
lawful
resident
alien
would
be
unable
to
work
and
that
would
frustrate
california
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
no,
they
are
not.
in
fact
those
people
are
encouraged
by
the
immigration
to
keep
working
to
support
their
families
until
they
can
get
there
status
adjusted.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
the
regulations
say
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
no.
that
is
--
the
regulation
says
anyone
in
possession
of
the
green
card
or
any
other
federal,
any
document
issued
by
the
immigration
that
authorized
them
work.
but
they
do
not
issue
these
documents
to
one
of
this
aliens
who
are
subject
to
having
their
status
adjusted.
they
know
where
they
are
and
it
takes
a
period
of
time
to
get
their
--
they
have
to
investigate
their
background
and
they
do
not
issue
them
letter
or
anything
that
says
they
can
continue
to
work
because
it
is
not
a
problem
in
the
federal
statute.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes,
they
are
authorized
to
work.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
they
did
not
come
in
under
a
visa,
but
the
policy
of
the
government
is
to
continue
them
to
work
while
they
are
having
their
status
adjusted.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
but
under
this,
i
do
not
know
how
many,
but
i
am
sure
would
be
on
a
thousand
would
have
to
make
an
application
to
get
their
status
adjusted
or
loose
there
job.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
initially
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
usually
these
are
people
that
have
been
here
for
four
or
five
or
even
10
or
20
years
who
have
families
and
are
now
a
part
of
the
community
and
they
are
either
a
parent,
a
child
or
a
spouse
of
a
citizen
or
a
lawful
resident
alien
and
the
government's
policy
is
to
keep
them
in
the
country
until
they
can
get
their
status
adjusted
otherwise
they
are
going
to
break
up
the
family
units.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
do
not
think
that
is
probably
true.
yes.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes
that
is
true.
congressman,
since
i
believe
has
a
bill
in
right
now
to
recapture
those
or
to,
everyone
that
has
been
in
the
country.
i
think
it
is
three
years
will
be
granted
an
amnesty
type
thing
so
that
they
can
have
their
status
adjusted.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
the
green
card
is
given.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
what?
on
the
green
card?
mr.
william
s.
marrs
no.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well
no,
it
is
the
practice
of
the
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
no
it
is
not
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
was
just
bringing
in
up
in
relation
to
the
petitioners'
reply
brief
as
far
as
the
i151
cards
in
the
documents.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
i
think
there
is
an
actual
conflict
with
1324
(a)
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
the
lower
court
went
on
the
occupation
ground
that
the
immigration
nationality
act
was
so
comprehensive
that
the
states
were
precluded
from
them
acting
even
though
the
federal
scheme
was
not.
there
was
a
void
there.
i
think
2805
in
the
regulations
brings
us
right
into
the
situation
of
truax
and
that
is
if
2805
is
valid
then
prudent
employers
in
the
state
of
california
will
refuse
to
hire
all
aliens,
whether
they
are
illegal,
green
card
or
whatever
status
so
that
the
burden
is
not
on
them
to
determine
the
legal
status,
these
people
are
not
protected
by
title
vii
as
far
as
their
alienage
is
concerned
and
they
would
either
loose
their
jobs
or
would
have
to
take
lower
paying
jobs
where
employers
needed
to
recruit
other
people
from
the
workforce.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
then
he
is
put
on
the
position
of
judging
whether
the
green
card
is
valid
to
start
with
and
he
becomes
the
arbitrator
as
to
a
--
is
he
inherently
legally
or
is
he
not
inherently
legally
where
it
would
be
much
safer
for
him
just
to
hire
all
citizens
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
and
i
think
in
california
that
would
--
especially
in
southern
california,
that
is
a
real
possibility.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
maybe
the
green
card
is
a
forgery.
i
mean,
he
cannot
tell.
i
mean,
maybe
he
cannot,
maybe
it
is
a
bad,
maybe
it
is
a
bad
green
card
that
is
obviously
bad.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
that
is
conceivable.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
then
i
think
he
get,
kind
of,
what
is
a
legitimate
green
card
or
someone
else,
that
is
an
alien
that
is
entitled
to
work,
but
does
not
have
a
green
card.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
(inaudible)
well
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
do
not
know.
that
has
never
--
this
law
has
never
gone
into
effect
the
date
it
was
to
take
effect.
it
was
enjoined
by
a
superior
court
so
we
have
never
had
any.
we
do
not
have
any
case
law
under
that
all.
if
a
alien
was
a
151
one
card
looses
this
one,
apply
151
card
or
has
it
stolen
then
he
also
has
a
burden
on
him.
he
cannot
--
under
this
until
he
gets
a
new
card,
the
employer
would
not
hire
him
and
it
takes
from
six
months
to
two
or
three
years
to
get
a
new
i151
card.
it
is
also
our
position
that
2805
is
unconstitutional
because
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
has
so
--
is
so
comprehensive
that
they
have
left
no
room
for
the
states
to
legislate
and
i
think
there
is
a
specific
intent
by
congress
to
occupy
the
field
here.
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
in
foreign
affairs
and
immigration,
the
pervasiveness
of
the
legislation
is
very
comprehensive.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
thought
they
were
passing
the
comprehensive
bill.
the
only
earlier
state
legislation
on
this
was
struck
down
as
violating
the
foreign
commerce
clause
and
in
1917
when
the
immigration
nationality
act
was
passed,
they
continued
until
1952.
there
had
never
been
valid
state
intrusion
into
these
affairs.
if
2805
falls
within
the
parameters
of
the
hine’s
decision,
we
contend
because
there
is
such
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
that
the
states
cannot
help
it,
they
cannot
herd
it,
they
cannot
do
anything
to
it.
they
have
to
stay
away
from
it.
the
third
ground
upon
which
we
believe
2805
is
unconstitutional
is
that
it
is
in
direct
conflict
with
1324
(a).
2805
makes
the
crime
to
knowingly
employ
an
alien
not
entitled
of
lawful
residents.
1324
(a)
grants
an
exemption
for
such
an
employment.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
no.
that
is
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
the
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
in
my
brief
it
is
at
page
seven
of
the
appendix.
it
is
u.s.c.
1324
(a).
mr.
william
s.
marrs
at
7e
and
the
proviso
was
on
page
eight,
provided
however.
also
congress’
action
with
these
bills,
hr982
and
8713,
both
of
those
bills
are
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes
there
is.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
as
regards
1324
(a)
there
is
some.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
hr982
and
now
8713
specifically
repeal
that
proviso
and
attach
liability
to
the
employer.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
way
they
do
it,
those
are
three-step
process
and
that
is
one
they
give
a
citation
to
the
administrative
fine
and
then
three
there
is
a
criminal
penalty
and
congress
did
this
i
think
trying
to
balance
on
interest
because
there
are
various
groups
that
feel
this
will
cause
discrimination
against
minorities
if
they
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
that
will
cause
discrimination
of
by
employers
against
minorities
in
this
field.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
it
is
been
deleted
in
the
proposed
legislation.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
the
citation
and
then
a
fine
and
then
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
a
--
i
think
that
shows
a
little
of
evidence
that
congress
is
well
aware
of
this
problem
and
they
are
trying
to
find
a
way
to
solve
it
and
california’s
way
is
not
their
way.
they
specifically
rejected
the
original
bill,
came
in
with
a
--
leave
us
a
thousand
dollar
fine
the
first
time
out
not
similar
to
california
it
is
only
lesser
amount
and
they
rejected
that
because
they
thought
it
was
too
severe
and
would
cause
problems
on
employers
and
it
would
cause
importers
to
discriminate
against
a
certain
minorities.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
in
fact
they
were
aware
of
it
in
1952
when
they
passed
the
act
and
in
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
believe
they
already
have,
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
can.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
yes.
of
course,
that
is
inherently
in
the
sovereign
power
of
the
nation.
when
the
act
was
passed
there
was
reference
by
the
petitioner
to
congressional
record,
senator
douglas
in
1952
offered
an
amendment
to
senate
bill
1851
which
became
this
exemption
1324
(a)
and
his
bill
would
have
removed
that
exemption
and
made
it
a
crime
to
knowingly
employee
and
employer
and
that
amendment
was
turned
down.
so,
in
concluding
it
is
our
position
that
this
subject
is
of
such
a
dominant
federal
concern
and
congress
has
weighed
the
burdens
on
the
rights
of
all
aliens
in
this
country
in
that
the
federal
branch
conducts
foreign
policy
and
foreign
affairs
and
that
california
is
intruding
into
this
area
and
they
are
prohibited
from
so
doing.
mr.
william
s.
marrs
are
they
california
cases?[laughter]
mr.
william
s.
marrs
well,
i
believe
it
is
the
printers
choice
and
that
the
--
mr.
william
s.
marrs
i
will
send
him
a
note
on
that.[laughter]
mr.
william
s.
marrs
thank
you.
