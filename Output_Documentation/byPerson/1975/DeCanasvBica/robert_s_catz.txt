mr.
robert
s.
catz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
are
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
california
court
of
appeals,
second
appellant
district.
this
case
raises
the
question
of
whether
a
state
statutory
scheme,
which
prohibits
domestic
employers
from
employing
aliens
not
entitled
to
lawful
residence,
is
unconstitutional
under
the
doctrine
of
federal
preemption.
in
1971,
the
california
legislature
enacted
the
labor
code,
section
2805.
this
statute
was
enacted
in
recognition
by
the
california
legislature
that
the
increasing
numbers
of
illegal
aliens
coming
into
california
were
imposing
severe
hardships
on
the
state's
economy.
the
statutes
provides
in
part
and
the
statute
is
reproduced
in
our
brief,
petitioners'
brief
at
page
three,
that
no
employer
shall
knowingly
employ
an
alien
who
is
not
entitled
to
lawful
residence
in
united
states,
if
such
employment
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
lawful
resident
workers.
in
addition
to
the
above
provision,
2805
imposes
misdemeanor
penalties
on
employers
who
utilize
the
illegal
labor
and
in
addition
creates
a
private
cause
of
action
against
employers,
which
allows
employees
to
go
into
the
local
superior
court
to
enjoin
employers'
use
illegal
labor.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
petitioners,
domestic
farm
workers
from
california
were
employed
by
respondents'
farm
labor
contractors
for
approximately
three
months
during
the
summer,
harvest
season
of
1972.
in
september
of
1972,
respondents
laid
petitioners
off
on
the
grounds
that
respondents
had
a
surplus
of
labor
and
thus
had
no
work
available
for
them.
as
a
direct
consequence
of
being
laid
off
and
believing
that
respondents
were
employing
illegal
labor,
petitioners
commenced
this
action
in
the
local
superior
court
of
santa
barbara,
california,
pursuant
to
section
2805,
alleging
that
respondents
were
open
and
notorious
employers
of
illegal
labor.
in
fact,
at
one
point
in
our
complaint,
petitioners
alleged
that
during
the
four-month
period
in
1972,
the
united
states
boarder
patrol
visited
the
work
site
of
respondents
and
apprehended
over
40
illegal
aliens.
among
other
things,
petitioners
sought
their
own
job
reinstatement,
damages
and
a
permanent
injunction
against
respondent's
willful
and
continued
employment
of
illegal
aliens.
after
full
evidentiary
hearing
on
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
in
which
petitioners
sought
to
present
evidence
of
respondents’
use
of
illegal
labor,
respondents
filed
a
demur,
challenging
the
validity
of
section
2805
on
the
ground
that
statute
was
preempted
by
the
federal
immigration
law.
the
trial
court
granted
respondents'
demur
and
declared
section
2805
unconstitutional
on
several
grounds,
but
specifically
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
was
preempted
by
federal
immigration
law.
petitioners
subsequently
appealed
this
ruling
to
the
california
court
of
appeals,
which
it
affirmed
and
the
cal.
supreme
court
denied
petitioners’
request
for
discretionary
review.
a
petition
for
cert
was
sought
to
this
court
and
granted.
at
issue
here
today
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
state’s
statutory
scheme,
fashioned
to
protect
citizens
and
lawful
resident
workers
from
the
unfair
competition
caused
by
the
influx
of
illegal
aliens
into
california.
that
the
problems
of
illegal
aliens
is
one
of
great
public
importance,
of
course,
is
not
in
dispute
today.
this
court
took
the
opportunity
to
outline
the
scope
of
the
problem
just
last
term
in
its
series
of
u.s.
boarder
patrol
cases.
in
california,
the
problems
of
illegal
aliens
is
particularly
huge,
since
california
--
because
of
california’s
close
proximity
to
the
mexican
border.
illegal
aliens
go
virtually
unchecked
producing
drastic
effects,
particularly
on
low
income
and
minority
residents
who
suffer
substantial
job
displacement.
in
addition,
illegal
aliens
create
a
substantial
wage
(inaudible)
into
mexico,
adversely
affecting
the
local
economies.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
appendix,
your
honor,
in
the
superior
court's
opinion,
he
expresses
the
view
that
he
had
no
doubt
that
we
could
have
established
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
do
not
think
the
court
of
appeals
really
addressed
that
because
the
case
went
up
on
a
demur,
it
was
just
considering
the
statutes,
the
validity
of
the
statute
itself.
thus
we
submit
that
without
a
favorable
adjudication
of
the
constitutionality
of
section
2805,
the
continued
employment
of
illegal
aliens
who
may
render
jobless
thousands
of
lawful
resident
workers
in
california,
in
addition,
domestic
employers
who
by
long
time
business
practice
intentionally
seek
out
and
rely
on
illegal
labor
will
profit
at
the
sake
of
the
economy
and
will
do
so
with
total
impunity.
at
this
time
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
petitioners
outline
for
the
court,
how
the
state
statutory
scheme
operates
and
what
obligations
it
imposes
on
domestic
california
employers.
in
1971,
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
it
imposed
the
primary
enforcement
obligations
of
the
statute
on
the
california
labor
commissioner.
pursuant
to
section
2805,
the
california
labor
commissioner
promulgated
a
comprehensive
set
of
regulations
interpreting
section
2805
and
the
regulations
are
found
at
pages
1a
through
3a
of
petitioners'
reply
brief.
first,
the
california
labor
commissioner
defines
an
alien
not
entitled
to
lawful
residence.
the
commissioner
defines
an
alien
entitled
to
lawful
residence
as
any
non-united
states’
citizen
who
possesses
documentation
issued
by
the
federal
government,
authorizing
him
or
her
to
work.
thus,
when
an
applicant
and
employee
seeks
employment
and
an
employer
has
an
express
obligation
to
inquire
whether
the
applicant
be
either
a
citizen
or
an
alien.
if
the
applicant
employee
claims
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
he
must
sign
a
declaration
to
that
effect
under
oath.
if
an
applicant
claims
to
be
an
alien,
he
must
then
display
proper
federal
documents
that
are
issued
by
the
united
states
department
of
labor,
attesting
to
his
employment
certification
and
now
this
must
be
done
within
three
days
of
commencement
of
employment.
employer
liability
then
attaches
when
he
fails
to
take
the
steps
i
have
just
described
and
an
employee
is
found
to
be
--
later
on
an
employee
is
found
to
be
unlawful
resident
alien.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
yes,
there
has
your
honor.
the
last
regulation
--
it
is
in
the
brief
at
page,
reply
brief,
at
3a,
defines
what
an
adverse
effect.
now
28
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
at
page
3a,
petitioners'
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
yes.
now,
section
2805
requires
that
use
of
illegal
labor
must
have
an
adverse
effect
on
lawful
resident
workers
as
you
have
pointed
out
your
honor.
adverse
effect
arises
whenever
illegal
labor
is
employed
in
an
occupation
not
deemed
to
be
a
shortage
of
labor
in
that
field
by
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
united
states
department
of
labor.
now,
the
department
of
labor
promulgates
and
lists
those
areas
of
employment
in
this
country
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
labor
and
those
regulations
are
found
at
29c
of
our
section
60
at
sect.
in
addition,
adverse
effect
is
defined
--
arises
whenever
an
employer
pays
an
illegal
worker
less
than
the
prevailing
minimum
wage,
either
state
or
federal.
thus
for
purposes
of
a
hypothetical,
physicians
is
one
occupation
or
profession
in
which
the
secretary
of
labor
has
deemed
that
there
is
a
shortage
in
this
country.
so
that
if
an
illegal
alien
came
to
california
and
was
engaged
as
a
brain
surgeon
and
was
employed
by
the
california
hospital,
as
long
as
the
california
hospital
paid
him
in
excess
of
the
minimum
wage,
the
hospital
employer
would
not
be
subject
to
liability.
in
the
case
we
have
here
today,
there
is
a
surplus
of
agricultural
labor
and
in
other
words,
liability
attached
against
the
respondents
because
the
secretary
of
labor
of
the
united
states
did
not
list
agriculture
as
a
field
in
which
there
was
a
shortage
of
labor.
where
federal
and
state
laws
have
regulated
in
the
same
area,
this
court
is
evolved
two
basic
approaches
in
determining
the
constitutional
preemptive
ability
of
the
state
law
in
question.
the
first
approach
or
test
is
often
referred
to
as
occupation
and
that
renders
any
state
attempt
to
regulate
a
federal
area
invalid,
even
though
it
maybe
agreed
that
the
states’
scheme
does
not
impair,
but
enhances
and
aids
in
the
achievement
of
a
federal
goal.
the
lower
court
in
this
case
held
and
this
is
the
area
that
we
complain
off,
is
that
2805
was
an
attempt
by
the
state
of
california
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
immigration
and
the
lower
court
concluded
that
congress
by
the
mere
enactment
of
a
comprehensive
immigration
nationality
act,
that
of
1972,
thus
had
expressed
its
intent
by
just
the
mere
enactment
to
have
occupied
the
field.
now,
we
believe
that
the
lower
court
erred
because
any
judicial
preemption
decision
in
this
case,
based
on
the
occupation
test,
should
not
have
been
applied
and
we
say
that
because,
first,
there
is
no
textual
evidence
in
the
immigration
nationality
act,
where
its
legislative
history
or
even
other
federal
laws,
the
congress
specifically
intended
to
preclude
the
states
from
enacting
limited
statutes
such
as
2805.
we
submit
that
section
2805
is
not
an
immigration
law,
but
a
law
that
regulates
the
labor
practices
of
domestic
employers.
we
will
concede
that
the
statute's
long
range
affect
thus
have
an
indirect
and
incidental
effect
on
immigration,
but
the
statute
does
not
regulate
immigration
policy.
instead,
the
statute
prescribed
a
specific
employment
practice
of
domestic
employers.
section
2805
and
the
simple
many
regulations
issued
by
the
california
labor
commissioner,
use
federal
immigration
and
labor
law
definitions
to
effectuate
a
local
labor
law
policy.
the
statute
in
no
way
alters
federal
determinations
concerning
entry
into
the
united
states
and
in
what
terms
and
conditions
entry
maybe
made.
section
2805
merely
precludes
the
knowing
employment
by
california
employers
of
those
individuals
defined
by
federal
law
administrative
practice
is
not
authorized
to
work
in
united
states
by
virtue
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
the
h.r.
8713
reported
out
of
mr.
elburg’s
committee.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
it
is
--
we
have
heard
testimony.
the
bill
has
been
reported
out
of
the
house.
it
was
supposed
to
go
to
the
house
rules
committee
and
that
is
scheduled
for
the
spring
according
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
it
very
much
is.
but
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
it
might.
it
is
my
feeling
that
it
certainly
would
not--
it
would
deal
with
the
problem,
but
whether
how
it
would
affect
this
case,
i
hazard
to
say.
i
might
say
that
there
is
no
action
foreseen
on
the
rodino
bill
in
the
senate
at
all
and
no
hearings
were
scheduled
and
my
information
is
that
not
to
expect
it.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
well,
it
goes
a
little
bit
beyond
the
illegal
aliens.
in
other
words,
it
defines
lawful
resident
aliens
as
anybody
who
really
is
not
certified
by
the
department
of
labor
to
work.
thus
for
example,
if
a
student
from
south
korea
was
attending
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
and
decided
to
get
a
job
during
the
summer
and
did
not
have
proper
certification
from
the
department
of
labor
to
authorizing
him
to
work
and
an
employee
who
is
adversely
affected
by
him
or
her
taking
that
position
could
get
injunctive
relief
under
section
2805,
but
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute,
of
course,
was
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
illegal
aliens
which
congress
has
refused
to
deal
with,
at
least
in
the
employment
area.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct,
but
when
i
use
the
term
lawful
residence
that
is
the
definition
that
does
not
come
from
the
federal
scheme.
that
is
the
labor
commissioner's
definition
of
dealing
with
who
is
allowed
to
work
by
federal
standards.
there
may
very
well
be
people
who
are
entitled
to
be
in
the
united
states,
but
not
entitled
to
work
and
so
the
statute
goes
a
little
bit
beyond
the
illegal
aliens.
anybody
that
comes
into
california
who
is
either
a
citizen
or
authorized
to
work
by
the
secretary
of
labor
will
not
be
affected
by
section
2805.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct,
your
honor
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
it
actually
preceded
our
case
by
a
week.
it
was
argued
the
same
month.
the
appellants
in
that
case
were
the
state
of
california
and
for
some
reason
they
declined
to
take
the
case
to
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
would
be
our
position,
your
honor.
i
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
perhaps
in
the
absence,
i
will
not
strongly
concede
it,
but
in
the
absence
of
the
california
labor
commissioner's
implementing
regulations,
interpreting
section
2805,
that
the
statute
itself
would
be
seriously
in
question
in
terms
of
its
validity.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
the
california
labor
commissioner's
definitions
and
policies
salvage
2805.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
note
that
first
of
all,
in
the
area
of
employment
other
than
in
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act
which
i
will
be
addressing
in
a
few
minutes,
there
is
no
federal
law
which
deals
with
this
area
that
california
has
entered
into.
but
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
illegal
aliens
do
not
even
come
in
contact
with
the
state
of
california
in
section
2805.
if
for
example
the
california
labor
commissioner
were
to
go
out
and
visit
an
industrial
factory
and
discover
that
there
were
500
illegal
aliens
working
there,
the
california
labor
commissioner
would
have
no
authority
to
apprehend
the
alien
itself.
the
entire
relationship
is
between
the
employer
and
the
state
of
california
and
of
course,
california
does
not
stand
at
the
mexican
border
and
waive
people
of.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
the
section
2805
merely
adopts
the
standards
that
the
united
states
department
of
labor
utilizes
in
determining
who
can
work.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
in
schedule
b
as
well.
schedule
b
in
29
cfr
lists
those
occupations
in
which
there
is
no
shortage
and
labor
certification
would
not
be
allowed
by
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
well,
that
code
of
regulation
of
course
is
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
references
in
the
immigration
nationality
act
inviting
the
department
of
labor
to
determine
those
occupations
in
which
there
is
a
shortage
or
surplus
of
labor.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
no,
your
honor.
well,
there
is
none
in
the
immigration
nationality
act.
there
is
in
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act,
but
that
is
limited
to
the
farm
labor
context
and
not
to
industrial
employers.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
well,
i
would
draw
to
the
court's
attention
for
purposes
of
our
preemption
discussion,
section
15
of
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act
amendments
of
1974
provide
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
yes.
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
that
is
at
page
32
of
petitioners'
opening
brief.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
white,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
the

mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
that
congress
is
less
spoken
on
the
area
of
illegal
aliens
with
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act
and
it
deals
to
get
to
the
--
it
attempts
to
get
to
the
root
of
the
problem.
i
think
a
final
word
perhaps
needs
to
be
mentioned
about
the
anti
harboring
provisions
of
the
immigration
nationality
act
and
they
are
at
page
7
of
our
rely
brief.
this
is
the
only
specific
federal
statute
which
respondents
argue,
poses
a
potential
conflict
with
section
2805
and
that
is
section
274
(a)
(3)
of
the
act
and
this
section
provides
that
any
person
who
“willfully
or
knowing
conceals,
harbors
or
shields
from
detection
any
alien
not
duly
admitted
or
not
lawfully
entitled
to
enter
and
reside
within
the
unites
states
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony.”
now,
to
prevent
the
interpretation
that
employment
per
se
would
constitute
a
crime
under
this
section
and
i
emphasize
the
word
this
section,
congress
added
the
following
proviso,
“provided,
however,
that
for
purposes
of
this
section,
employment,
including
the
usual
and
normal
practices
used
in
the
employment
shall
not
be
deemed
to
constitute
harboring.”
now,
this
statute
while
exempting
employment
pre
se
from
the
crime
of
harboring,
does
not
purport
to
grant
an
absolute
exemption
from
criminal
or
civil
sanctions
for
employers
of
illegal
aliens.
there
may
well
be
given
set
effects
in
which
the
knowing
employment
of
illegal
aliens,
particularly
where
an
element
of
concealment
or
procurement
is
involved.
may
subject
an
employer
to
criminal
sanctions
under
the
act.
now,
there
has
been
no
specific
judicial
interpretation
of
274
(a)
(3)
i
believe
by
this
court,
but
examination
of
the
legislative
history
reveals
that
the
congressional
intent
was
to
protect
the
innocent
and
unknowing
employer
from
prosecution
under
this
section.
so
we
would
argue
the
274
(a)
(3)
indicates
no
more
than
congressional
silence
regarding
the
prohibition
against
the
intentional
and
knowing
employment
of
illegal
aliens.
this
section
does
not
express
an
intent
to
protect
the
knowing
employment
of
illegal
aliens
either
in
its
text
or
in
its
legislative
history
and
neither
thus
this
section
express
an
intent
by
congress
to
preempt
the
state
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
we
are
in
relying
heavily
on
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act
amendments
and
actually
if
this
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
what
page,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
s.
catz
well,
of
course
respondents
have
vigorously
argued
that
point
and
gone
one
step
further
and
suggested
for
example
that
section
2805
will
drive
illegal
aliens
out
of
california
into
neighboring
states
and
i
would
like
to
just
say
that
perhaps
the
potential
is
there
for
that,
but
in
fact
there
is
no
mechanism
for
enforcing
the
statute.
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
would
say
to
the
court
that
section
2805
will
be
a
panacea
for
solving
the
immense
problems
that
california
is
having.
however,
i
would
say
that
if
the
statute
has
any
value,
is
that
it
at
least
provides
a
vehicle
until
congress
fails
to
act
to
deal
with
a
limited
number
of
employers
in
california
that
knowingly
hire
illegal
aliens
and
use
it
and
rely
on
illegal
labor
in
running
there
business.
california
does
not
have
the
resources
to
strike
out
against
employers,
but
at
least
it
will
be
in
the
position
to
deal
with
those
of
few
employers
that
will
be
abusive.
so
i
do
not
think
there
is
an
actual
problem
that
will
transcend
beyond
the
california
borders.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
the
problem
is
national
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
would
think
so,
but
i
would
be
--
i
am
little
lost
to
understand
the
solicitor’s
conclusion
that
it
is
not
appropriate.
of
course,
i
do
not
recall
anything
in
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
the
word
appropriate
comes
from
the
language
of
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act
on
section
15
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
court,
i
mean,
what
the
makers
of
the
bill
meant
by
appropriate.
i
would
like
to
urge
the
court
that
it
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
think
that
is
correct
and
that
would
be
one
of
the
arguments.
i
think
that
this
case,
if
i
may
suggest
to
the
court,
can
be
adequately
disposed
on
on
a
very
narrow
ground
and
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
2805
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
that
by
congress’
mere
enactment
of
a
comprehensive
immigration
nationality
act,
that
congress
intended
to
occupy
the
field
without
there
being
anything
more.
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
dispose
of
this
case
in
the
same
manner
in
which
it
disposed
of
the
dublino
case
which
was
a
recent
preemption
decision
of
this
court
where
new
york
had
it
implemented
a
state
win
program
and
there
was
a
federal
win
program
and
the
lower
courts
declared
that
the
state
win
program
was
preempted
by
federal
immigrate
--
by
the
federal
adc
program.
in
rendering
the
decision
in
this
case,
this
court
did
not
reach
the
conflicts
question
and
we
are
merely
suggesting
that
this
court
need
not
reach
the
conflicts
question
either,
that
it
can
render
its
decision
based
on
the
occupation
test
alone.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
well,
i
am
merely
suggest
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
would
suggest
to
you
merely
that
since
the
lower
court
rendered
its
decision
based
on
the
occupation
test
alone
that
perhaps
might
be
the
only
question
that
was
before
the
court.
of
course
we
have
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
federal
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
that
is
merely
one
suggestion
that
i
will
offer
and
i
only
--
and
i
do
that
simply
because
of
the
way
this
case
disposed
of
the
dublino
matter.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
yes.
in
all
candor,
i
do
not
think
and
i
say
so
respectfully,
i
do
not
think
the
california
court
knew
why
it
rendered
the
case
unconstitutional.
there
are
overlapping
doctrines
in
its
opinion
and
it
is
hard
for
the
reader
to
conclude
whether
they
reached
the
preemption
decision
on
either
occupation
or
conflict
and
i
invite
the
court
to
look
at
that
opinion.
in
closing,
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
lower
court's
declaration
that
section
2805
is
unconstitutional
on
the
grounds
of
federal
preemption.
we
do
so
because
we
believe
that
section
2805
is
but
a
labor
statute
that
touches
on
the
field
on
immigration
law
in
an
incidental
manner,
but
in
a
very
limited
area
that
congress
has
not
expressly
indicated
its
intent
to
occupy
the
field
and
finally
the
statute
far
from
conflicting
with
federal
law,
furthers
the
accomplishment
of
federal
law,
policies,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
preempt.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
think
there
is
room
in
the
record
and
there
was
a
substantial
transcript
as
well.
mr.
robert
s.
catz
i
think
the
opinion
is
rather
nebulous
and
i
--
mr.
robert
s.
catz
perhaps
you
honor.
that
of
course
is
for
the
court
to
determine.
thank
you.
