mr.
catz,
the
statute
is
conditional.
it
says
no
employer
shall
knowingly
employ
an
alien
who
is
not
entitled
to
lawful
residence
in
the
united
states.
if
such
employment
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
lawful
resident
workers.
has
it
been
any
administrative
definition
of
that
condition?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
it
now?
justice
potter
stewart
of
your
reply
brief,
page
3a?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
catz
(inaudible)
my
brother
rehnquist
a
moment
ago.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
as
you
told
us
earlier
that
the
statute
does
not
--
as
administratively
construed,
it
does
not
mean
one
seems
to
say,
it
does
not
apply
to
aliens
who
are
not
entitled
to
lawful
residence,
but
rather
to
aliens
who
are
not
entitled
to
work
in
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
as
determined
by
the
federal
authorities,
by
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
that
extent
you
say
this
precisely
is
congruent
with
the
federal
classification
and
no
more
than
effectuates
the
federal
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
the
sanction
if
any
in
the
federal
scheme,
it
is
simply
deportation
of
the
alien,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it.
i
understood
your
brother's
submission
to
be
that
under
these
regulations,
under
california
regulations,
anybody
permitted
to
work
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
is
permitted
to
work
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
misunderstand
that?
justice
potter
stewart
why
on
earth
would
an
employer
hesitate
under
this
california
statute
to
hire
an
alien
who
had
a
green
card
because
in
order
to
be,
to
violate
the
state
statute
he
has
to
knowingly
employ
an
alien
who
is
not
permitted
to
work
in
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
duality?
justice
potter
stewart
that
proviso
is
till
in
effect
and
there
is
a
bill
pending
that
would
delete
it
and
would
substitute
a
three-step
process.
the
first
(inaudible)
first
a
warning,
i
think
and
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
so
far
it
is
pending
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
if
do
not
they
include,
you
cannot
see
the
black
pentagon?
