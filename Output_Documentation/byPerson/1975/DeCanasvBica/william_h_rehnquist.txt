justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
clear
from
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeals
that
your
clients
would
have
been
entitled
to
relief
under
the
california
statute,
had
it
--
the
court
of
appeals
not
found
it
to
be
preempted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
the
superior
court
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
catz
i
presume
your
case
is
stronger
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
californiaâ€™s
regulation
is
limited
just
to
illegal
aliens
rather
than
if
it
had
been
addressed
to
all
aliens,
legally
or
illegal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
deal
with
lawful
aliens
you
have
got
problems
with
the
cases
like
truax
against
raich?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
the
thought
that
perhaps
the
california
court
would
have
a
sharper
idea
than
we
would
of
the
application
of
2805?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
would
see
other
alien,
you
mean
the
green
card
people
that
come
across
on
a
daily
basis
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
subject
to
having
their
status
adjusted,
that
means
they
are
illegally
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
are
not
authorized
by
the
federal
government
to
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
expressly
authorized?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
--
that
is
a
matter
of
discretion.
i
mean,
they
can
make
an
application
for
status
adjustment
and
may
be
turned
down
by
the
commissioner
(inaudible)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
deportation
has
been
suspended
pending
outcome
of
the
change
in
status
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
1324(a)
is
a
california
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
cited
or
set
out
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
congress
has
been
a
lot
aware
of
it
long
time
and
has
not
done
much
about
it?
