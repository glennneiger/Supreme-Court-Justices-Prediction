justice
potter
stewart
did
the
district
court
consider
this
underlying
pleading
as
one
filed
under
2255
of
title
28?
justice
potter
stewart
court
never
explicitly
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
set
out
those
grounds?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
statute
explicitly
dealing
with
this
subject
in
federal
habeas
corpus,
in
federal
habeas
corpus,
you
say
it
is
a
case
law?
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
the
statute
goes,
it
just
says
that
you
can
obtain
it?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
proceed,
the
same
rule
would
be
constitutionally
required
in
any
state
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
a
decision
analogous
to
the
hardy
case
in
state
courts,
but
a
roughly
equivalent
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
and
its
progeny?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except,
you
concede
that
the
statute
provides
it,
that
even
if
it
is
5
years,
10
years,
15
years,
18
years,
23
years,
that
if
he
shows
a
need,
then
he
is
entitled
to
the
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
as
suggested
by
the
colloquy
with
my
brother
marshall,
there
is
a
time
limitation
on
appeal
and
there
is
none
in
collateral
attacks,
save
only
that
the
applicant
must
still
be
in
custody?
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
to
hold
that
that
statue
is
pro
tato
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
potter
stewart
because
here
the
statutory
condition
is
not
that
the
suit
be
not
frivilous
and
that
the
transcript
is
needed
to
decide
the
issue
presented
by
the
suit
or
appeal,
but
it
really,
by
a
trial
judge’s
or
a
circuit
judge’s
certificate?
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
the
facts
may
be?
justice
potter
stewart
what
happens
in
case
the
district
judge
simply
refused
the
request
for
a
transcript?
justice
potter
stewart
wihtout
--
justice
potter
stewart
without
certifying
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
an
individual
judge,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
any
judge
at
that?
justice
potter
stewart
he
appealed
the
dismissal?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
part
of
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
allegation
of
any
seperate
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
mr.
easterbrooks’
position
to
be
that
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
was
not
a
ground
upon
to
support
collateral
relief.
the
total
absence
of
any
evidence
would
clearly
be,
under
thompson
against
louisville.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
something
available
on
appeal,
but
not
on
collateral
attack.
is
it
that
not
mr.
easterbrook‘s
position?
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
this
court's
jurisprudence
goes,
one
is
a
constitutional
violation,
the
other
is
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
viewed
the
court's
decision
as
a
constitutional
decision,
did
he
not,
judge
taylor?
