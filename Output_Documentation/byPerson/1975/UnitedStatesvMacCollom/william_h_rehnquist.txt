justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
an
implicit
limitation
in
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
at
least
reserving
the
question
of
whether
if
the
reporter
had
died,
his
notes
were
unavailable
and
a
transcript
simply
could
not
be
prepared.
i
did
not
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
suggest
the
man
would
simply
be
out
on
the
street
for
that
reason?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook,
you
used
the
word
parameters,
what
do
you
mean
by
that
word?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
interchangeably
with
perimeters?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
not
of
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
relating
to
the
explanation
of
the
right
to
appeal,
but
simply
a
claim
limited
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial?
you
say
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
never
be
raisable
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
federal
court
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
a
direct
appeal
on
the
federal
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
mr.
strait
that
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
of
its
holding
is
broader
than
it
was
necessary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
then
where
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
last
sentence
says,
we
hold,
that
is
really
dicta,
which
it
may
well
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
strait,
you
previously
suggested
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
were
virtually
impossible
to
raise
on
appeal
or
at
least
very,
very
difficult,
but
certainly
insufficiency
of
evidence
claims
are
not
difficult
to
raise
on
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
guess
the
traditional
form
to
raise
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
do
you
need
a
constitutional
right
to
do
so
when
you
got
a
statutory
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
he
was
not
able
to
because
he
did
not
do
so.
are
you
saying
that
had
he
chosen
to
appeal,
there
would
have
been
some
impediment
to
his
raising
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
of
course
he
was
never
advised
that,
but
he
does
not
allege
that,
does
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
had
he
gone
ahead
and
appealed,
he
would
have
had
a
transcript,
and
perhaps
could
have
made
that
allegation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
your
man
does
not
allege
in
his
petition
that
he
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
do
not
know
what
he
would
and
what
e
would
not
allege
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
allege
the
transcript?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
cannot
he
put
in
the
application
or
petition
he
filed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
suggest
that
the
whole
thing
is
kind
of
a
balancing
process,
but
certainly
in
cases
such
as
ross
against
moffitt,
where
we
held
there
was
no
right
to
counsel
on
a
discretionary
appeal.
that
is
not
in
terms
of
balancing
the
financial
harm
of
the
state
against
the
benefit
to
the
indigent.
it
is
just
a
question
of
saying
the
indigent's
rights
goes
so
far
and
no
further?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
may
be
right,
but
the
analysis
is
in
terms
of
access,
not
in
terms
of
what
burdens
that
then
would
place
on
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
suggest
that
congress
would
have
had
to
enact
the
habeas
corpus
act
of
1867?
for
80,
90
years,
there
was
no
collateral
review
even
of
federal
convictions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
no
one
thought
for
the
first
80
years
of
the
republic
that
it
had
that
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
1867
act
not
bracket
federal
prisoners
or
the
pre-1867
litigation
cover
federal
prisoners
the
way
the
1867
act
covered
state
prisoners?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
there
is
not
an
opinion
for
the
court.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
mr.
justice
steward
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
in
the
judgment.
the
case
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
respondent
maccollom
was
convicted
in
federal
court
of
uttering
forged
currency
and
he
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
in
prison
under
1970.
he
didn't
appeal
at
judgment
of
conviction,
therefore
didn't
obtain
the
free
transcript
of
the
trial
to
which
all
indigent
attendants
are
entitled
when
they
do
appeal.
he
then
filed
a
motion
pursuant
to
section
2255
of
title
28
in
which
he
sought
to
set
aside
his
conviction
on
the
grounds
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
insufficient
evidence
to
support
the
conviction.
he
moved
for
a
free
transcript
in
connection
with
this
motion
stating
that
he
could
not
effectively
frame
his
arguments
without
it.
he
didn't
elaborate
on
why
these
particular
claims
required
a
transcript.
the
district
court
appointed
counsel
held
a
hearing,
but
refused
to
supply
respondent
with
a
few
transcript
and
ultimately
dismissed
or
denied
his
motion.
respondent
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
court
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
congress
has
expressly
addressed
the
question
of
furnishing
transcripts
at
public
expense
in
28
u.s.c
section
753(f)
and
it
provides
in
substance
that
on
direct
appeal
an
indigent
defendant
gets
a
transcript
automatically,
but
when
a
collateral
proceeding
after
the
opportunity
for
direct
appeal
is
passed,
the
defendant
gets
a
transcript
if
the
trail
judge
certifies
that
the
suit
or
appeals
is
not
frivolous
and
the
transcript
is
needed
to
decide
the
issue
presented.
here
the
district
court
resolved
those
issues
against
respondent.
while
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
these
restrictions
place
respondent
in
a
less
advantageous
position
than
a
person
of
means,
we
reject
his
claim
that
it
violates
his
equal
protection
rights
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendment.
to
do
so
respondent
has
received
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
his
claim
fairly
and
this
is
all
that
was
required.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
brenna,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall.
