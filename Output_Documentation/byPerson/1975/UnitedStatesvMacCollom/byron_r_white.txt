is
it
a
statutory
standard
or
does
the
statute
provide
for
the
standard
for
review
on
direct
appeal
of
the
evidence,
or
is
it
a
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
collateral
relief
in
the
federal
court
with
respect
to
a
federal
prisoner,
cannot
you
make
an
allegation
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
a
statute
or
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
not
this
situation
here
arise
only
where
or
mostly
where
the
issue
involved
was
not
raisable
on
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
had
been
appeal,
there
would
have
been
a
transcript,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
practical
matter,
this
problem
would
arise
only
when
there
has
not
been
an
appeal
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
as
though
it
would
hardly
ever
arise
if
it
were
in
the
case
of
a
state
prisoner?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
would
have
exhausted
his
state
remedies
which
would
include
an
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
they
held
that
it
is
requied
by
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
currently,
the
majority
of
the
active
judges
that
believe
that
wade
bound
neither
or
they
would
have
grant
a
hearing?
