mr.
john
strait
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
john
strait.
i
am
the
attorney
representing
the
respondent
in
this
case,
who
is
the
petitioner
and
the
appellant
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
below.
i
will
try
to
address
some
differences
of
opinion
which
the
respondent
has
with
the
petitioner
here
in
his
position
regarding
the
issues
before
this
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
considerably
narrower
than
that
as
stated
by
the
petitioner
here.
the
issue
is
far
closer
than
what
you
have
implied,
mr.
justice
stevens,
by
your
questions
and
that
is
not
simply
on
a
general
allegation
of
demand
for
a
transcript,
thus
an
indigent
federal
petitioner
subject
to
pursuing
his
rights,
under
section
2255,
become
entitled
to
a
transcript,
but
rather
where
there
is
an
allegation
of
specific
constitutional
error,
in
this
case,
the
violation
of
the
defendant
in
the
original
case
as
the
petitioner's
rights
to
sixth
amendment
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
fifth
amendment
due
process
rights
for
lack
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
where
that
specific
allegation
is
made,
and
made
in
good
faith,
but
cannot
be
supported
by
specific
references
to
the
record,
because
the
record
does
not
exist,
with
which
to
support
those
allegations.
mr.
john
strait
basically;
that
is
the
respondents’
position
herein.
mr.
john
strait
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
have
seen
several.
the
difference
between
my
position
here
and
the
solicitor
general's
is
that
i
represent
a
lot
of
people
in
post
conviction
proceedings
and
one
of
the
roles
of
the
counsel
in
trying
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
strait
no,
not
normally,
not
unless
i
am
very
certain
that
there
is
some
basis
to
support
that.
mr.
john
strait
i
am
saying
that
at
least
that
combined
with
the
sixth
amendment,
which
is
the
case
before
the
court
--
mr.
john
strait
you
will
find
that
in
the
appendix
at
page
11
thru
13,
the
court's
appendix.
mr.
john
strait
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
11.
petitioner
in
good
faith
believes
the
transcript
will
show
that
and
then
at
the
top
of
page
12,
a
petitioner
who
was
not
afforded
an
effective
assistance
of
the
counsel
as
required
by
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
and
immediately
below
that,
sub
b,
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
support
--
mr.
john
strait
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
the
problem
that
was
confronting
the
petitioner
--
mr.
john
strait
well,
the
problem
is
–
mr.
john
strait
the
answer
is
yes.
the
problem
with
that,
if
i
understand
your
reluctance
to
accept
that
position,
is
that
these
are
constitutional
claims.
they
are
in
fact
constitutional
claims
which
require
a
transcript
in
order
to
be
asserted
and
reviewed
by
the
court
and
indeed
for
the
trial
counsel,
that
is
the
counsel
that
is
representing
the
individual
at
the
trial
court
level
on
the
post-conviction
relief
proceeding,
to
have
it
available
to
him
to
review
solely,
so
he
can
tell
whether
they
are
meritorious
to
raise
and
that
is
the
problem
that
has
been
recurrent
in
the
pleadings
here
and
the
misquoting
of
the
statement
taken
by
respondent
herein
at
the
court
of
appeals
below.
mr.
john
strait
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
strait
i
would
have
a
caveat
to
that
position.
that
is
his
position,
yes.
i
would
have
a
caveat
to
that
position
to
the
degree
that
the
difference
between
a
total
lack
of
evidence
in
the
record
for
the
fifth
amendment
or
fourteenth
amendment
purposes
versus
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
not
an
apparent
difference
in
standard.
as
in
my
experience
with
appellant
courts,
the
issues
are
treated
exactly
the
same.
mr.
john
strait
well,
i
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
the
position
that
i
am
asserting
is
that
the
constitutional
implications
or
the
standard
that
is
actually
employed
in
reviewing
the
record
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
was
an
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
the
standards
that
are
employed
in
order
to
determine
the
lack
of
evidence
under
the
fifth
amendment,
in
my
experience,
had
been
co-extensive,
and
so
the
problem
is
essentially
partially
a
semantic
one
in
that
the
necessity
of
the
transcript
to
raise
either
issue
is
exactly
the
same,
and
whether
one
could
raise
one
only
on
appeal,
and
the
other
properly
in
either
appeal
or
post-conviction
relief.
mr.
john
strait
no,
i
believe
it
would
be
case
law.
there
is
no
statutory
standard.
mr.
john
strait
yes,
but
again
i
think
the
standard
that
the
petitioner
would
bare
would
be
exactly
the
same,
whether
you
rephrase
it
in
the
constitutional
or
the
statutory
sense.
he
would
have
to
show
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
the
statutory
element
that
he
was
arguing
was
not
sufficiently
reflected.
mr.
john
strait
no,
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
would.
it
could
in
fact,
be
raised
on
the
appeal.
the
effective
assistance
of
the
counsel
issue
might,
for
practical
reasons,
not
be
available
on
appeal
because
of
the
difficulty
of
the
individual
involved,
knowing
that
he
would
suffer
from
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
john
strait
yes,
that
would
be
correct,
for
all
practical
purposes.
the
solicitor
general’s
office
is
not
conceding
that
you
are
entitled
to
a
transcript
as
of
right
and
appeal
without
a
showing
of
some
need.
presumably
they
are
trying
to
adhere
the
position,
the
narrowest
reading
of
hardy
versus
united
states
which
says
at
least,
where
there
is
a
new
counsel
on
appeal,
there
is
an
absolute
right
of
the
trial
testimony
transcription,
but
they
are
holding
open
the
question
of
whether
there
is
original
appointed
counsel
or
original
trial
counsel
on
appeal.
mr.
john
strait
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
exactly
the
reason
why
the
government’s
position
herein
does
not
address
the
problem
which
maccollom
faces,
which
is
this
is
his
only
remedy.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
answer
in
brief,
there
can
be
no
allegation
and
intentional
bypass,
the
record
does
not
support
that.
the
very
problem
raised
by
the
sixth
amendment
effective
assistance
of
counsel
as
implied
by
your
question
is
that
the
individual
who
is
subject
to
the
ineffective
assistance
of
the
counsel
will
also
have
his
appeal
rights
affected
by
that.
mr.
john
strait
it
would
be
extremely
unlikely
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
strait
normally
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
strait
that
is
correct;
under
the
virtually
unanimous
rules
of
the
states,
which
i
am
familiar.
mr.
john
strait
no,
that
would
certainly
be
raisable
in
most
state
court
appeal
proceedings.
mr.
john
strait
and
in
a
subsequent
federal
court
proceeding.
mr.
john
strait
yes.
mr.
john
strait
very
substantially,
justice
rehnquist.
what
i
am
suggesting
specifically
is
that
the
actual
language,
which
the
government
bases
virtually
the
entirety
of
its
position
upon
is
not
the
holding
in
the
cases
exclusively
dicta,
because
in
this
particular
case,
the
indigent
petitioner
under
section
2255
did
allege
constitutional
error.
he
did
allege
a
good
faith
belief
that
it
existed.
he
did
show
that
there
was
no
adequate
alternative
to
a
transcript
with
which
to
present
the
material
to
the
court
and
the
functioning
of
section
2255
left
him
with
no
alternative,
but
to
follow
this
procedure.
mr.
john
strait
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
asserting,
yes.
i
am
saying
that
if
the
court
wishes
to
breach
the
broader
issue,
that
is,
the
issue
which
has
been
framed
by
the
solicitor
--
his
representative
here,
is
where
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
a
transcript
for
any
indigent
federal
prisoner
proceeding
ancillary
to
a
2255
proceeding,
that
issue
is
not
really
before
this
court,
and
ought
not
to
be
reached.
mr.
john
strait
i
think
what
the
court
of
appeals
confronted
was
the
problem
of
other
courts'
interpretations
of
the
demands
of
753
(f),
with
particular
reference
to
specific
claims
like
of
the
sixth
amendment
ineffective
assistance
of
the
counsel,
and
found
that
that
was
the
most
compliance
that
could
be
provided.
mr.
john
strait
no,
there
would
have
to
been
a
certificate
and
that
issue
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
strait
no,
i
believe
that
is
correct.
what
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
rests
upon
is
its
reading
of
the
interrelationship
between
section
1915,
the
general
forma
pauperis
provision,
and
753
(f)
and
the
apparent
inconsistency
in
relation
to
habeas
corpus
2255,
and
in
forma
pauperis
generally
and
said,
in
view
of
the
unclear
statutory
nature
that
now
the
solicitor
general
is
asserting,
that
is
quite
clear
to
him
based
on
his
prior
reading
of
the
cases,
but
certainly
there
is
some
room
for
disagreement
about
that.
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
addressed
some
of
the
ambiguities
here
in
an
article
in
43
federal
rules
decision,
which
addresses
the
at
least
the
nominal
nature
of
the
problem.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
attempted
to
fashion
a
remedy,
given
that
situation,
ought
not
to
be
disturbed,
since
there
is
no
particular
reason,
given
the
nature
of
the
holding
here
to
do
so,
that
is
the
actual
holding
of
the
case.
mr.
john
strait
i
think
that
there
are
constitutional
principles
which
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
adopt
that
particular
statutory
reading.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
actual
literal
holding
that
the
court
of
appeals
reached,
in
their
mind,
was
a
constitutional
holding.
mr.
john
strait
i
think
that
if
they
had
felt
they
could
not
have
interpreted
the
statutes
that
way,
the
way
that
they
did,
they
would
have
been
forced
to
strike
them
constitutionally,
which
of
course,
is
the
position
that
we
assert
here
insofar
as
it
applies
to
maccollom's
particular
case.
mr.
john
strait
yes,
judge
taylor
did
and
i
would,
in
that
regard,
to
be
candid,
i
would
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
unless
the
constitution
places
some
pressure
upon
reading
the
statutes
that
way,
that
would
be,
in
fact,
the
way
that
you
would
interpret
the
statutes.
yes.
mr.
john
strait
they
exclusively
viewed
it
as
a
constitutional
question,
simply
saying
that
there
was
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
statutory
interpretations
adopted
by
other
circuits
and
in
the
initial
hearing
of
wade
v.
wilson
which
was
ultimately
reversed
and
remanded
on
other
grounds
by
this
court.
no
reason
in
the
ninth
circuit,
no
reason
to
adopt
a
different
interpretation,
unless
there
was
a
constitutional
reason
to
do
so,
and
they
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
cour's
decision,
this
court's
decision
as
to
--
mr.
john
strait
the
position
of
the
panel
was
that
wade
did
not
reach
the
issue,
specifically
and
that
wade
had
been
cast
in
further
doubt
to
the
degree
that
its
dictum
did,
by
the
subsequent
court
decisions
across
in
north
carolina
versus
britt.
mr.
john
strait
that
is
correct,
and
i
might
add
that
as
the
litigant
there,
i
was
so
much
surprised
that
they
did
not;
i
expected
them
to
do
so.
the
position
that
we
assert,
has
not,
i
think
been
accurately
presented
to
the
court,
not
too
surprisingly
by
the
solicitor
general
in
regards
to
article
1,
section
9,
clause
2.
since
this
is
the
only
forum
that
the
petitioner
below,
the
respondent
herein
has,
in
which
to
assert
his
sixth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
deprivations
of
which
he
complains,
the
question
of
his
right
to
transcript
becomes
one
of
access,
not
simply
a
nice
tool
to
help
him,
once
he
gets
in
because
of
the
way
that
the
section
2255
operates.
and
i
would
refer
you
to
the
extensive
discussion
of
2255
and
its
procedures
in
the
hayman
case,
which
this
court
decided,
and
also,
in
the
socol
article,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief.
you
might
also
refer
to
the
university
of
kansas
law
review
article
in
volume
20,
student
note,
which
talks
about
the
dilemma
which
is
presented
to
the
petitioner,
who
asserts
claims,
such
as
maccollom's.
specifically,
what
happens
is,
in
order
to
assert
his
constitutional
claims
of
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
depravations
of
right
to
counsel
and
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
the
problem
then
becomes
one
of
him
having
to
identify
as
a
prerequisite,
to
even
having
his
2255
application
accepted,
and
then
getting
his
transcript.
he
has
to
identify
to
the
record
in
a
procedure
very
similar
to
that,
struck
down
by
this
court
in
gardner
versus
california.
he
has
to
identify
the
basis
for
his
claimed
allegations
of
error.
mr.
john
strait
no,
that
is
correct.(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
strait
i
agree.
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
guarantee
to
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
and
the
bypass
argument
essentially
which,
the
solicitor
general
relies
upon
to
emphasize
this
policy
choice
of
congress
to
emphasize
appeal
over
post-conviction
relief,
stands
the
constitutional
relationship
between
post-conviction
relief
and
appeal
on
their
head.
mr.
john
strait
you
do
not,
but
maccollom
would,
because
in
maccollom’s
situation,
he
had
both
the
problems;
sixth
amendment
and
ineffective
assistance
of
the
counsel,
fifth
amendment,
pardon
me,
insufficiency.
he
was
not
able
to
raise
by
appeal
because
he
did
not
do
so,
and
if
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
strait
no,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
very
process
of
the
choice
to
appeal
was
affected
by
the
very
ineffective
assistance
of
the
counsel,
which
he
asserts.
secondly,
if
the
government
is
to
say
that
there
has
been
a
essentially
an
intestinal
bypass
of
the
right
to
a
transcript,
not
the
right
to
post-conviction
relief,
which
they
can
not
argue,
because
of
article
1,
section
9,
clause
2,
then
the
problem
is
that
nowhere
was
maccollom
advised,
and
i
am
certain
of
this,
that
the
record
will
reflect
it,
nowhere
was
maccollom
advised
that
if
he
did
not
exercise
his
right
of
appeal
now,
he
would
not
get
a
transcript.
it
would
stand
the
concept
of
waiver
on
its
head.
of
course
he
was
never
advised
of
that,
and
that
is
not
in
fact
--
mr.
john
strait
no,
he
cannot
at
this
time
until
he
gets
the
transcript.
mr.
john
strait
but
the
problem
is,
i
understand
your
position.
the
problem
is
that
he
would
have
to
know
that
he
should
appeal
in
order
to
get
a
transcript
before
he
can
knowingly
make
any
decision
to
bypass
that
right,
if
you
follow
me.
mr.
john
strait
no,
he
does
not
allege
that
he
was
not
advised
to
his
right
to
appeal
by
the
court.
the
allegation
that
he
would
make
specifically
when
this
matter
is
returned
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
would
be
that,
his
attorney
did
not
advise
him
of
what
would
happen
if
he
did
not
appeal.
mr.
john
strait
well,
the
problem
is
that
most
of
the
material
that
is
involved
in
that
issue
was
also
connected
to
the
sixth
amendment
question
because
there
was
a
colloquy
he
believes,
and
i,
as
the
attorney,
entered
the
case
afterwards,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
this
is
accurate
or
not
until
i
see
the
transcript,
he
alleges
that
there
was
a
colloquy
between
him
and
the
attorney
on
the
record
--
mr.
john
strait
no,
it
is
not,
but
the
point
i
am
raising
is
that
the
only
way
it
will
ever
get
before
anyone
is
if
he
has
a
transcript.
mr.
john
strait
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
strait
he
probably
would
have
been
willing
to
do
so.
the
attorney
who
was
representing
him
at
that
time
felt
that
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
that
would
in
fact
turn
out
to
be
the
case,
and
wanted
to
see
the
transcript
first
before
he
took
up
the
court's
time
in
allegation,
that
he
thought
very
likely,
could
be,
in
fact,
frivolous,
which
raises
a
number
of
issues
that
i
wish
to
discuss
briefly
with
the
court.
and
these
would
have
to
do
with
the
policy
questions
before
the
court
that
are
presented
by
the
broader
issue,
which
if
the
court
reaches,
i
think
it
should
consider,
and
we
submit
it
should
consider.
the
governments’
position
is
virtually
exclusively
that
there
is
a
burden
on
court
reporters
services
and
that
there
is
a
financial
interest
in
reducing
the
availability
of
transcripts
in
situations
such
as
maccollom's.
this
court
has
never
found
that
monetary
considerations
alone
justify
the
depravation
of
right
to
a
transcript
or
availability
to
a
transcript
in
an
original
proceeding.
secondly,
as
i
believe
justice
marshall
pointed
out
by
his
question,
there
are
likely
to
be
an
increased
number
of
requests
for
transcripts,
so
that
there
will
be
proportionately
less
monetary
saving,
if
any.
thirdly,
as
the
counsel
for
--
mr.
john
strait
i
agree.
i
think
ross
supports
the
position
that
maccollom
takes
here,
which
is
that
since
the
discretionary
appeal
is
being
exercised,
as
the
court
points
out
with
a
series
of
factors,
including
the
availability
of
a
transcript,
the
prior
assistance
to
counsel,
presumably
the
availability
of
counsel
prior
to
the
time
he
withdraws
from
the
discretionary
appeal
application,
etc.
mr.
john
strait
i
agree,
and
that
is
why
i
have
been
emphasizing
that
it
is
a
question
of
access
here,
not
simply
a
question
of
expense,
but
there
are
policy
considerations
which
the
solicitor
general
has
raised
regarding
expense
and
availability
of
resources
for
doing
things
like
this,
and
i
felt
it
was
appropriate
to
address
those.
our
position
really
is
that
the
very
policy
of
post-conviction
relief
and
the
efficient
functioning
of
the
lower
courts
requires
that
maccollom’s
position
be,
in
fact,
adopted
and
my
premise
is
that
the
screening
function,
performed
both
by
counsel
where
counsel
exists.
in
the
day
of
legal
services
and
prison
legal
services
projects
that
is
not
as
uncommon
for
indigents
as
it
used
to
be
without
the
capacity
to
retain
counsel
and
secondly,
the
function
of
the
court
itself
in
reviewing
2255
applications
will
be
greatly
enhanced,
and
minimize
ultimately
the
judicial
time
expended.
for
exactly
the
same
reason
that
those
district
court
and
federal
attorneys
have
adopted
the
policy
in
some
areas
in
the
country,
and
not
resisting
transcript
applications
because
of
the
litigation
cost
and
time
involved
in
litigating
whether
the
persons
entitled
to
them
or
not,
the
court
will
be
spared
that
amount
of
time,
when
the
record
by
the
pro
se
applicant
comes
into
him,
with
or
without
the
assistance
of
the
counsel
at
some
point,
the
record
will
reflect
clearly
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
the
claimed
errors,
which
will
allow
the
reviewing
judge,
consider
with
greater
freedom
to
screen
the
cases
and
get
rid
of
them,
if
they
are
in
fact,
frivolous.
lastly,
the
dilemma
that
i
was
addressing
to
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
of
the
trial
lawyer's
ability
to
try
to
find
out
if
there
is
a
merit
to
what
its
client
says
is
greatly
enhanced,
where
the
lawyer
in
fact
exists
and
that,
in
my
experience,
is
one
way
of
minimizing
some
impact
on
the
courts
for
frivolous
claims.
mr.
john
strait
that
may
work.
there
are
a
number
--
mr.
john
strait
well,
it
depends.
speaking
as
a
trial
lawyer
mr.
justice,
i
found
that
i
almost
always
need
one
because
the
things
that
i
am
focusing
on
is
an
advocate
in
court
to
a
jury
are
very
different
than
the
kinds
of
things
i
review
the
record
for
to
be
addressed
in
appellant
court
or
in
a
post-conviction
relief
proceeding.
mr.
john
strait
very
often
not,
but
what
i
do
is
i.
mr.
john
strait
not
in
my
experience
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
strait
yes,
but
the
notes
very
rarely
reflect,
for
example,
on
the
basis
of
the
courts
rulings
on
issues
and
evidence
which
--
mr.
john
strait
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
strait
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
not
sure
--
i
believe
my
time
has
expired
so
i
will
conclude
with
these
remarks.
the
problem
is
presented
for
the
particular
indigent
2255
petitioner
in
maccollom
situation
is
that
where
he
is
raising
sixth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
issues
as
he
has,
the
transcript
itself
becomes
the
access
issue
under
the
scheme
of
2255.
without
the
transcript,
he
cannot
frame
his
issues
properly
to
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court
for
the
initial
screening,
and
once
the
district
court
has
screened
them,
cannot
review
the
issues
properly
as
to
frivolity
without
the
transcript
to
tell
whether
those
issues
are
properly
set
forth
in
the
record.
given
that
situation,
the
statutory
scheme
would
present
article
1,
section
9,
clause
2,
suspension
of
the
writ
problems,
as
i
have
stated
in
my
brief,
if
the
court
were
to
reject
the
position
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit,
as
to
the
narrow
category
of
petitioners
represented
by
maccollom,
the
respondent
before
this
court.
mr.
john
strait
and,
in
addition,
those
that
have
shown
by
their
affidavit
no
adequate
alternative
to
a
transcript
from
which
to
get
that
information,
and
also
those
who
had
counsel
appointed,
which
was
the
case
for
maccollom,
by
the
initial
trial
court;
all
three
of
those
distinguishing
factors.
excuse
me,
i
take
it
that
i
do
have
more
time,
thank
you.
the
primary
problem
that
is
presented
by
the
government’s
approach
to
habeas
corpus
is
that
it
presumes
that
there
is
some
necessary
incentive
available
through
the
appellant
scheme
which
undercuts
habeas
corpus.
that
obviously
could
not
be
a
proper
congressional
purpose.
while
there
may
be,
in
fact,
values
to
be
emphasized
by
encouraging
early
appeal
in
criminal
cases.
the
simple
fact
remains
is
central
to
the
government's
bounding
was
the
concept
of
habeas
corpus,
which
means
that
there
never
will
be
a
concept
of
finality
in
criminal
law,
the
same
as
there
would
be
in
a
civil
case.
for
that
very
reason,
most
of
the
government's
arguments
concerning
the
advantages
which
congress
has
created
by
discouraging
habeas
corpus,
simply
do
not
address
the
constitutional
question
which
is
raised
by
maccollom
situation.
mr.
john
strait
that
is
a
very
tough
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
my
position
is
that
today,
there
would
have
to
be
some
implementation,
or
an
interpretation
by
the
courts
that
the
habeas
corpus
act
was
self-implementing,
and
that
we
have
never
had
to
confront
the
question
with
the
judiciary
act
alone.
if
it
were
none,
it
would
not
present
some
jurisdictional
basis
for
habeas
corpus.
mr.
john
strait
my
position
is
that
article
1,
section
9,
clause
2
would
become
self-effectuating,
and
the
courts
would
have
to
entertain
such
motions,
presumably,
such
proceedings,
presumably,
this
court.(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
strait
well
i
believe
that
there
was,
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
if
i
am
not
--.
that
is
correct
(voice
overlap)
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
john
strait
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
strait
yes,
it
does,
there
is
no
question,
the
judiciary
act
of
1917
--
mr.
john
strait
that
is
right
and
this
court
had
not
been
confronted
with
a
position
prior
to
the
fourteenth
amendment's
enactment
of
whether
the
habeas
corpus
right
would
have
to
implemented
directly
by
the
states
and
prior
to
the
time
that
could
have
confronted
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
right
made
applicable.
the
problem
has
been
resolved
by
the
legislation
to
which
you
referred.
the
position
that
the
government
takes
with
regards
to
the
equal
protection
issue
raised
by
a
respondent
below,
i
believe
misstates
the
position
which
both
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
in
its
opinion
and
that
asserted
to
here
by
a
respondent.
specifically,
the
equal
protection
position
taken
is
not
that
the
wealthy
person’s
standards
are
to
be
met
by
the
state
or
the
federal
government
in
aiding
indigent
prisoners.
quite
the
contrary,
the
issue
is
one
of
adequate
access,
and
the
language
which
the
lower
court
relied
upon,
which
i
submit
is
appropriate
and
meets
maccollom’s
requirements
in
this
case,
is
a
language
of
this
court
in
ross
v.
moffitt,
specifically,
that
the
duty
of
the
system
is
to
assure
the
individual,
the
indigent
defendant,
an
adequate
opportunity
to
present
his
claims
fairly,
and
at
least
where
sixth
amendment
claims
and
the
fifth
amendment
claims
as
asserted
by
maccollom
or
raised,
that
required
transcript
in
the
post-conviction
relief
context
of
habeas
corpus.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
government
can
assert
to
the
contrary
that
the
language
we
relied
upon
below
is
any
different.
that
is
the
standard.
it
is
the
standard
used
by
this
court
in
equal
protection
cases
in
right
to
transcript
and
right
to
counsel,
and
that
is,
i
believe,
the
only
standard
adopted
by
the
lower
court
decision.
mr.
john
strait
it
is
an
awkward
question
to
answer,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
my
client’s
position
right
now
is
that
he
was
revoked
recently
and
is
presently
incarcerated
in
the
king
county
jail
for
seattle,
washington,
pending
a
federal
detainer
hearing,
a
federal
review
hearing
of
his
parole
status,
which
i
have
been
advised,
he
will
be
returning
to
federal
custody,
presumably
at
mcneil
island,
and
whether
he
will
be
transferred
again
to
leavenworth,
kansas,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
strait
he
remains
now
an
indigent,
but
in
custody
and
indigent.
he
is,
if
you
will
pardon
the
expression,
disgustingly
indigent.
mr.
john
strait
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
strait
i
meant
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
affidavit
in
forma
pauperis,
which
is
part
of
this
court's
records.
he
submitted
a
new
affidavit
as
of
the
filing
of
the
proceeding,
the
petition
for
a
review
by
this,
by
the
sloictor
general.
mr.
john
strait
yes,
and
at
that
time,
he
had
been
employed
for,
i
believe,
a
total
gross
income
of
$1000
in
the
previous
nine
months,
all
of
which
was
expended
at
that
time
and
he
has
not
been
employed
since,
which
i
assume
is
one
of
the
reasons
he
got
into
trouble
with
his
parole
status.
mr.
john
strait
i
agree
and
for
the
purposes
of
custody
for
2255
proceedings,
the
fact
that
he
was
either
actively
on
parole
or
in
custody
would
be
sufficient.
the
indigent
--
mr.
john
strait
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
john
strait
to
clarify
that
matter,
i
can
assert
with
certainty
that
the
individual
is
still
indigent
at
this
time,
and
is
not,
at
anytime,
during
the
pendency
of
his
proceedings
been
other
than
indigent
within
the
prior
definitions
of
indigency,
by
case
law.
thank
you,
very
much.
