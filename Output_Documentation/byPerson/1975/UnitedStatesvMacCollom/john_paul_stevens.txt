justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
supposing
in
his
motion,
he
had
alleged
that
his
trial
counsel
was
ineffective
in
that
he
had
failed
to
make
objections
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence
from
time
to
time
during
the
trial,
that
competent
counsel
would
normally
make,
would
he
be
entitled
to
a
transcript?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
only
error
goes
to
the
confidence
of
counsel,
perhaps,
i
should
change
the
example
to
make
it
a
little
stronger,
that
he
did
not
make
projections
which
any
trained
lawyer
would
make,
you
know,
the
standard
is
framed
differently
in
different
circuits,
but
assuming
you
have
met
in
conclusionary
terms
the
standard,
how
can
you
charge
him
with
a
failure
to
appeal,
if
he
relies
exclusively
on
the
advice
of
the
man
he
now
says
is
incompetent,
but
did
not
realize
at
the
time
his
was
incompetent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
that
that
would
not
be
sufficient,
if
it
were
merely
stated
as
a
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
theory
he
alleges
that
he
was
so
ineffective
that
the
defendantâ€™s
sixth
amendment
right
was
violated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
for
a
second.
do
you
concede
that
our
holding
in
this
case
will
necessarily
determine
the
state
practice
as
well
as
the
federal
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
a
holding
against
you
would
necessarily
rests
on
the
constitution,
which
is
what
i
probably
should
have
asked?
justice
john
paul
stevens
id
it
possible
mr.
easterbrook
to
hold
that
an
adequate
showing
of
need,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
is
made
by
an
allegation
that
the
petitioner
was
not
afforded
effective
assistance
of
the
counsel
as
required
by
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
more!
would
not
that
be,
at
least,
a
theoretically
permissible
way
of
deciding
the
case
without
reaching
the
constitution
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
it
is
to
my
understanding
that
there
are
federal
districts,
at
least
there
have
been,
in
which
as
a
matter
of
routine,
the
united
states
attorney
automatically
orders
a
transcript
in
all
cases
in
order
that
they
will
expedite
the
preparation
of
record
and
shorten
the
period
required
for
appeal,
for
disposition
of
the
appeal.
do
you
know
the
extent
to
which
that
practice
is
followed
in
the
federal
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
involve
a
transcript?
