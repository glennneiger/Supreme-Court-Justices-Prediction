the
stenographic
minutes
are
still
available?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
did
not
have
reach
the
constitutional
question?
what
is
the
ground
do
you
percieve
n
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
says
it
did
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
fact,
it
was
saying
that
was
constitutionally
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
on
an
allegation
such
as
my
brother
stevens
suggested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
could
be
reviewed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
boundaries
might
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
there
had
been
compliance
with
753
(f)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
it
be
compliance
with
753
(f),
except
as
an
application
for
and
the
certificate
rendered
either
by
a
trial
judge
or
a
circuit
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
at
the
very
least,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
does
not
rest
upon
a
holding
of
compliance
with
753
(f)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
judicary
act
of
(inaudible)
had
a
provision
that
covered
fereral
prosioners?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
extended
federal
habeas
relief
to
the
state
prisoners?
