mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
indigent
prisoner,
who
did
not
appeal
his
conviction,
has,
under
the
constitution,
an
unconditional
right
to
obtain
a
transcript
of
his
trial
for
perusal
in
the
hope
that
the
transcript
will
disclose
errors,
the
nature
of
which
he
does
yet
know.
put
another
way,
the
question
is
whether
congress
overstepped
its
constitutional
powers,
when
it
required
indigent
prisoners
to
show
that
they
had
some
need
of
a
transcript
to
support
a
non-frivolous
claim
for
relief.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
complicated.
respondent
was
convicted
in
1970
of
uttering
forged
currency,
and
sentenced
to
10
years
imprisonment.
he
did
not
appeal
that
conviction.
counsel
for
respondent
has
represented
that
the
reason
he
did
not
appeal
was
in
order
to
avail
himself
of
a
more
prompt
motion
in
the
district
court
for
reduction
of
sentence.
the
district
court
denied
that
motion.
in
march
1972,
respondent
filed
pro
se
a
motion
for
transcript
in
forma
pauperis.
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
court
instructed
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
return
that
motion
to
respondent,
instructing
him
that
he
should
file
instead,
a
motion
for
collateral
relief,
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2255.
in
june
of
1972,
respondent
filed
a
complaint
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief,
which
the
district
court
allowed
to
be
filed
as
a
civil
action.
this
complaint
alleged
that
respondent
desired
collateral
relief,
that
he
believed
that
his
counsel
at
trial
had
been
inadequate,
and
that
he
believed
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
his
conviction.
the
complaint
also
alleged
that
respondent's
memory
and
trial
notes
were
inadequate
and
that
without
a
transcript,
he
would
be
unable
to
frame
his
arguments
for
fair
and
effective
relief.
the
prayer
for
relief
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
district
court
did
not
state
how
it
was
considering
the
complaint.
it
dismissed
it
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
we
believe
that
the
best
interpretation
of
this
is
that
it
considered
it
as
complaint
under
2255
and
the
request
for
a
transcript
is
ancillary
to
that
complaint
and
then
dismissed
it
accordingly.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
court
never
explicitly
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--
set
out
those
grounds.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
he
is.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
believe
that
it
has
become
moot.
he
is
still
in
custody
for
purposes
of
collateral
relief,
so
long
as
he
is
on
parole
and
his
parole
runs
through
1980.
if
he
is
no
longer
indigent,
this
case
might
become
moot,
but
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
is
so.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
are
not
up
to
date.
the
record
in
this
case
closed
as
of
1973
and
we
have
no
further
information
as
to
his
indigence
after
that
date.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
transcript
is
a
transcript
of
a
two-day
trial,
your
honor.
it
would
probably
cost
in
the
nature
of
$400,
although
we
have
not
obtained
an
exact
estimate.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
stenographic
minutes
are
still
available,
although
they
have
not
been
transcribed.
the
prayer
for
relief
asked
the
district
court
to
declare
that
respondent
has
“an
absolute
constitutional
right”
to
a
verbatim
transcript
of
his
criminal
trial,
supplied
at
government
expense
to
aid
him
in
preparing
a
motion
for
collateral
relief.
the
complaint
is
in
essence,
simply
an
assertion
of
respondent’s
good
faith.
it
asserts
that
respondent
believes
that
his
trial
notes
are
inadequate,
and
that
he
believes
that
he
is
entitled
to
relief,
but
it
sets
forth
none
of
the
grounds
upon
which
those
beliefs
are
based.
the
district
court
appointed
counsel
for
respondent
in
order
to
investigate
the
claims
because
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
did
not
fully
disclose
whether
he
was
entitled
to
the
transcript
he
sought.
the
investigation,
with
the
aid
of
counsel,
disclosed
no
grounds
upon
which
a
transcript
was
needed,
other
than
as
respondent’s
counsel
candidly
admitted
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
peruse
in
the
hope
that
some
error,
the
nature
of
which
could
not
yet
be
determined,
might
show
up.
the
district
court
ultimately
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
a
transcript
must
be
provided
upon
request
to
search
for
error.
we
believe
that
the
starting
point
for
an
inquiry
into
an
indigent’s
right
to
a
trail
transcript
is
28
u.s.c.
753
(f).
that
section
provides
that
a
trial
transcript
can
be
furnished,
without
charge
to
an
indigent
prisoner,
proceeding
in
a
motion
for
collateral
relief,
under
section
2255,
and
i
quote
“if
the
trial
judge
or
a
circuit
judge
certifies
that
the
suit
or
appeal
is
not
frivolous,
and
that
the
transcript
is
needed
to
decide
the
issue
presented.”
in
other
words,
an
indigent
prisoner,
far
from
being
cut-off
on
account
of
poverty,
from
evidence
that
may
be
important
to
some
collateral
claims,
is
entitled
by
statute,
to
a
trial
transcript,
if
he
can
show
first
that
the
transcript
is
necessary
to
support
certain
factual
allegations
and
second,
those
allegations,
if
proved
by
the
transcript,
would
amount
to
a
non-frivolous
claim
for
collateral
relief.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
congress
meant
to
impose
upon
applicants
the
burden
of
demonstrating
need
and
lack
of
frivolity.
the
court
of
appeals
so
held,
and
that
portion
of
its
opinion
is
reproduced
at
pages
8a
to
10a
of
our
petition
for
certiorari.
the
legislative
history
of
section
753
(f)
shows
that
it
was
amended
in
1965
to
extend
to
proceedings
under
section
2255,
the
same
right
to
a
transcript
without
cost,
that
previously
had
been
available
in
habeas
corpus.
the
1965
amendment
adopted
verbatim,
a
1961
proposal
of
the
judicial
conference,
and
that
proposal
was
drafted
to
incorporate
the
almost
universal
rule
of
both
state
and
federal
courts.
a
rule
that
had
prevailed
in
collateral
cases
until
the
decision
below.
a
rule
that
a
prisoner
must
show
more
than
a
subjective
desire
for
a
transcript
in
a
collateral
proceeding
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
it.
we
believe
that
this
legislative
history
and
the
almost
universal
rule
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
also
disposes
of
respondent’s
argument
at
section
753
(f)
as
worded
and
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
suspends
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
far
from
suspending
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
section
753
(f)
makes
access
to
a
transcript
identical,
under
both
habeas
corpus
and
under
section
2255,
there
is
no
suspension.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
section
753
(f)
says
that
you
can
obtain
a
transcript
without
charge
in
habeas
corpus
cases.
the
case
law
is
and
was,
in
1965
and
was
before
then,
that
you
must
make
the
same
showing
that
section
753
(f)
requires
in
2255
cases,
but
it
is
a
case
law
requirement
rather
than
a
explicit
statutory
requirement.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
section
753
(f),
we
think,
does
no
more
than
enacting
to
law,
the
observations
of
this
court
in
many
of
the
cases,
beginning
in
1956
in
griffin
against
california,
agianst
illinois,
excuse
me,
dealing
with
a
right
to
a
transcript.
this
court
has
observed
many
times
that
a
transcript
is
not
necessary
in
every
case
and
that
in
many
cases,
less
than
all
of
the
transcript
will
suffice
and
the
legislature
can
take
steps
to
effect
those
rules.
section
753
(f)
is
such
a
step.
the
question
here,
therefore,
is
whether
the
device
congress
has
chosen
is
unconstitutional.
the
burden
of
my
argument
is
that
congress
has
provided
indigents
with
multiple
opportunities
to
review
their
criminal
convictions,
and
multiple
opportunities
to
obtain
a
transcript
that
would
facilitate
such
review.
congress,
therefore,
has
not
cut-off
review
on
account
of
a
person’s
poverty.
it
has
simply
structured
and
confined
the
methods
by
which
such
review
can
be
obtained.
congress
has
provided
the
fair
opportunity
for
review
that
this
court
has
held
is
required.
it
is
true
of
course,
that
the
provisions
of
753
(f),
requiring
an
indigent
person
to
show
need
and
lack
of
frivolity,
do
not
apply
to
a
person
who
can
pay
for
his
own
transcript
and
in
that
sense,
the
destitute
and
the
wealthy
are
not
treated
identically.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
this
to
be
fatal,
but
this
court
has
held
that
absolute
equality
is
not
required,
and
the
fact
that
a
particular
tool
might
be
of
use
to
some
defendants
and
applicants
for
collateral
relief,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
constitution
requires
its
provision.
the
constitution
requires
a
practical
opportunity
for
effective
review,
and
we
believe
that
congress
has
provided
that
opportunity.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
exactly,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--
as
much
as
was
necessary,
that
is
the
very
first
way.
every
defendant,
convicted
in
a
federal
criminal
case,
has
a
right
to
appeal
and
we
believe
that
is
also
true
in
every
state,
with
respect
to
serious
crimes.
on
appeal,
under
the
criminal
justice
act,
an
indigent
defendant
has
a
statutory
right
to
a
transcript
or
a
record
of
sufficient
completeness
to
allow
him
to
present
all
of
his
claims
on
appeal.
in
almost
every
case,
a
full
transcript
is
prepared
or
an
agreed
statement
of
facts
is
reached.
in
all
cases,
in
which
a
new
counsel
was
appointed
on
appeal,
the
criminal
justice
act
requires
a
full
transcript
to
be
prepared,
and
this
court
is
so
held
in
hardy
against
the
united
states.
an
indigent
defendant
who
seeks
collateral
relief
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
required
in
state
appeals.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
roughly
equivalent.
at
least,
there
would
be
a
requirement
of
a
record
of
sufficient
completeness
to
allow
you
to
present
your
claim
for
a
more
complete
record.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
so
your
honor.
an
indigent
defendant
for
whom
such
a
transcript
or
a
record
has
been
prepared
and
who
later
seeks
collateral
relief,
is
entitled,
without
charge,
to
a
copy
of
that
transcript,
and
therefore,
every
indigent
defendant
has
an
adequate
opportunity,
both
to
obtain
a
transcript,
and
to
obtain
full
review
of
his
claims,
without
charge,
and
without
making
a
particular
showing
of
need,
simply
by
appealing.
he
needs
to
resort
to
the
standards
under
753,
only
if
he
elects
not
to
appeal.
that
is
to
say,
no
defendant
in
the
federal
system
is
denied
a
transcript
on
account
of
his
indigence.
respondent’s
current
difficulties
stems
from
his
decision
not
to
appeal
and
not
from
the
federal
statutes
that
govern
provisions
of
transcripts.
then
too,
we
think
there
are
sound
reasons
for
the
decision
of
congress
to
create
a
different
standard
when
a
prisoner
seeks
a
transcript
for
use
in
preparing
a
motion
for
collateral
relief.
the
difference
acts
as
a
channeling
device,
encouraging
appeals,
rather
than
delayed
collateral
attacks.
congress
was
entitled
to
conclude
that
this
was
desirable
because
it
enables
and
indeed
encourages
errors
in
trial
to
be
detected
and
corrected
more
quickly.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
not
at
all,
your
honor,
not
at
all,
as
long
as
the
person
was
still
in
custody
for
purposes
of
2255,
in
court
of
appeals'
view
would
require
the
preparation
of
the
transcript.
that
might
be
difficult
in
some
cases,
if
the
original
stenographic
tapes
have
been
destroyed
or
lost.
usually,
it
is
much
less
likely
that
that
would
happen,
if
the
transcript
had
been
transcribed.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
would
be
some
difficulties,
we
think,
under
the
court
of
appeals
rule,
if
the
transcript
could
not
be
prepared
and
there
were
no
established
need
for
it.
in
that
event,
the
remedy
might
be
a
collateral
relief
for
want
of
a
transcript,
even
though
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
transcript.
that
problem
would
not
arise,
if
the
transcript
had
to
be
furnished
only
upon
the
showing
of
section
753
(f).
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no.
no
reason
whatever,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct,
no
demonstration
at
all
is
required.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
specifically
address
that
question,
your
honor,
as
indeed
it
did
not
have
to
because
a
transcript
could
be
prepared
in
this
case
if
that
is
necessary
and
i
think
that
question
is
still
fairly
open
to
litigation
in
the
ninth
circuit.
i
do
not
want
to
indicate
that
the
court
has
decided
that,
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
our
position
that
under
those
circumstances,
that
would
probably
not
state
a
claim
for
relief,
even
if
supported
by
the
transcript.
that
would
so
for
two
reasons:
one,
because
under
most
circumstances,
that
would
not
make
out
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel,
and
the
second
because
that
is
the
kind
of
claim
of
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel
that
could
be
raised
effectively
on
appeal.
it
is
type
of
trial
tactics
and
trial
decisions
that
can
be
reviewed
very
effectively
on
appeal
and
unless
the
allegations
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
were
coupled,
mr.
justice
stevens,
with
a
contention
that
counsel
was
also
ineffective
in
failing
to
advise
of
his
right
to
appeal
and
failing
to
pursue
an
appeal,
we
believe
that
those
kinds
of
claims
should
be
raised
on
direct
appeal,
and
not
on
collateral
attack.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
might
be
some
reason
to
inquire
whether
part
of
the
incompetence
dealt
with
failure
to
pursue
the
appeal.
assuming,
however,
that
part
of
the
incompetence
dealt
with
advising
him
accurately
of
what
would
be
good
grounds
for
appeal
and
whether
they
were
prospects,
if
there
were
a
detailed
showing,
and
if
the
claim
was
of
such
pervasive
error
throughout
the
trial,
that
no
reasonably
effective
counsel
would
have
engaged
in
this
course
of
conduct.
that
might
be
the
kind
of
claim
that
would
require
the
preparation
of
a
full
trial
transcript.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
it
were
just
simply
stated
as
the
conclusion
here,
that
is
my
counsel
was
ineffective,
it
truly
would
not
be
sufficient.
there
would
be
varying
degrees
of
sufficiency,
of
adequacy
of
the
claim.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
that
is
the
only
conclusion
that
is
no
adequate
to
require
a
trial
transcript.
not
only
because
of
the
reservations
i
have
expressed
and
answered
to
your
early
questions,
but
also
because
there
are
many
ways
in
which
trial
counsel
could
be
inadequate,
that
simply
would
not
show
up
in
a
transcript
and
an
adjudication
of
the
adequacy
of
counsel
could
take
place
without
a
transcript,
but
with
extrinsic
material,
or
with
portions
of
the
transcript,
or
if
a
greater
specificity
could
be
provided,
it
could
be
determined
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
claim,
even
if
proved
to
the
last
particular.
they
are
many
stopping
points
along
the
way,
between
the
claim
and
the
adjudication
and
not
all
of
those
stopping
points
are
going
to
require
a
transcript
to
determine
where
it
is.
that
is,
i
think,
a
very
sound
reason
why
congress
was
entitled
to
require
the
applicants
to
state
the
nature
of
his
claim,
so
that
it
could
be
determined
whether
this
was
one
of
those
cases
in
which
a
transcript
was
needed,
or
whether
it
was
not.
there
are
a
number
of
differences
between
direct
appeal
and
collateral
attack,
that
we
think
support
the
decision
of
congress
to
impose
different
standards
upon
access
to
a
transcript
under
them.
i
have
discussed
some
of
them
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens'
questions.
they
stem
primarily
from
the
fact
that
a
collateral
attack
is
not
a
substitute
for
direct
appeal
and
that
most
of
the
grounds
upon
which
ordinary
collateral
attacks
would
be
based,
for
example,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
or
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
underlying
conviction,
simply
do
not
you
the
transcript
at
all.
conversely,
most
of
the
errors
that
would
show
up
in
a
transcript
do
not
provide
grounds
for
collateral
attack.
ordinary,
evidentiary
rulings
of
the
trial
or
incorrect
or
inadequate
framing
of
the
charge
to
the
jury,
are
not
grounds
that
would
support
a
collateral
attack.
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
not
a
ground
that
would
support
a
collateral
attack.
on
collateral
attack,
the
only
claim
open
is
that
there
was
no
evidence,
and
that
the
absence
of
evidence
could
be
refuted
by
many
materials
other
than
the
provision
of
any
part
of
the
transcript.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
may
well
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
may
be
that
that
is
what
would
happen.
we
certainly
can
not
exclude
that
possibility,
but
if
that
occurs,
it
is
a
result
of
the
system
of
incentives
created
by
congress
and
we
think
that
congress
was
entitled
to
and
indeed
it
may
have
been
excellent
idea
to
create
those
incentives
because
of
the
desirability
of
resolving
promptly
any
claims
of
error,
so
that
innocent
men
can
actually
released
more
promptly
and
so
that
if
there
are
errors
that
require
a
new
trial,
the
new
trial
can
be
had
more
promptly
before
memories
are
faded
and
evidence
dissipated.
it
would
be
probably
be
a
good
idea
to
have
claims
of
this
sort
resolve
promptly
on
appeal,
rather
than
in
this
case,
6
or
7
years
later
on
collateral
attack.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
that
event,
he
must
face
the
consequent
claim
of
deliberate
bypass.
not
only,
as
in
this
case,
a
bypass
of
his
own
question
right
to
a
transcript
on
appeal,
but
a
deliberate
bypass
of
his
appellant
remedies,
sufficient
to
cut
off
later
claims
on
collateral
review.
the
jailhouse
lawyer,
i
am
afraid,
would
have
to
take
that
possibility
into
consideration.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
i
agree.
i
think
that
the
major
consequence
of
section
753
(f)
and
the
particularized
need
and
lack
of
frivolity
requirements
is
simply
to
require
individual
applicants
to
show
that
they
fall
within
the
exception
to
the
rule
that
normally
a
transcript
is
unnecessary
to
prosecute
a
collateral
attack
and
indeed,
in
light
of
the
burden
of
someone
who
seeks
to
overturn
his
conviction,
and
to
prove
that
he
was
not
justly
convicted,
to
show
that
he
is
in
fact,
entitled
any
relief
at
all.
only
by
exercising,
and
using
a
screening
device
of
this
sort,
can
congress
exercise
the
power
of
which
this
court
has
said
that
it
has,
to
determine
that
there
are
some
cases
in
which
transcripts
are
unnecessary
and
some
in
which
less
than
all
of
the
transcript
is
necessary.
screening
device
serves
other
purposes
as
well.
there
are
more
than
15,000
federal
defendants
in
criminal
cases
every
year
who
elect
not
to
appeal.
there
are
large
numbers
of
defendants
in
state
criminal
cases
who
elect
not
to
appeal.
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
upheld,
there
will
be,
at
least
for
a
period
of
time,
a
rather
crushing
burden
upon
court
stenographers
and
reporters
to
produce
large
numbers
of
transcripts.
it
is
a
burden
that
might
well
slow
down
the
process
of
production
of
transcripts,
for
those
for
whom
there
is
a
real
and
demonstrable
need.
moreover,
the
requirements
congress
has
used
create
at
least
rough
equality
between
the
destitute
defendant
and
the
prisoner
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
insofar
as
it
rests
upon
the
constitution
your
honor,
it
would
necessarily
determine
the
state
practice
as
well.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
light
of
the
explicit
provision
of
congress
in
section
753
(f),
that
there
should
be
a
showing
of
need
and
lack
of
frivolity,
i
think
the
decision
by
this
court
would
have
to
rest
on
the
constitution.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct,
to
the
extent
that
it
places
those
two
requirements
upon
an
applicant
for
collateral
relief.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
court
of
appeals
said
in
a
footnote
that
it
was
addressing
a
deficit
not
filled
by
the
statute.
we
do
not
perceive
on
what
grounds
it
could
require
congress
to
expend
moneys
and
to
provide
the
transcript
to
indigents
when
it
has
elected,
by
statute,
not
to
provide
such
a
transcript,
unless
the
constitution
requires
that.
it
was
the
constitution
that
court
of
appeals
thought
that
required
it
to
fill
the
deficit.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
the
only
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
the
court
did.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
without
more?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
believe
that
would
be
a
theoretically
permissible
way
to
decide
the
case.
although,
in
that
event,
there
will
be
some
tension
between
the
outcome
of
this
case
and
the
court’s
resolution
in
coppedge
against
united
states,
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
standard
for
assessing
frivolity
of
a
motion
for
leave
to
appeal
in
formo
pauperis,
is
an
objective
standard.
that
is,
it
depends
upon
demonstrable
facts
and
not
upon
the
feelings
or
beliefs
of
the
person
who
is
asking
to
appear
in
formo
pauperis.
if
it
were
sufficient,
simply
to
make
a
claim
that
i
believe
that
i
was
not
given
the
adequate
assistance
of
counsel,
that
would
be
an
entirely
subjective
standard
and
would
amount
to
that
extent,
we
think,
to
a
change
of
the
standard
that
was
established
by
coppedge.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
and
if
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
that
has
never
been
litigated.
we
have
never
sought
through
review
such
a
certificate.
there
is
no
express
prevision
in
the
statute
or
in
the
criminal
(voice
overlap)
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
would
not
like
to
foreclose
our
opportunity
to
test
that,
but
i
would
say
that
we
have
never
sought
to
review
them
and
that
ordinarily,
if
a
trial
judge
or
an
appellant
judge
makes
a
certificate
that
is
quite
sufficient
for
the
government.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
dismissed
--
he
dismissed
the
claim
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--
without
certifying
anything.
the
respondent
then
could
have
sought
leave
from
a
judge
of
court
of
appeals.
he
could
have
sought
the
certificate
from
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--
from
any
judge.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
did
not
do
that
because
it
was
his
intention
to
establish
the
principle
that
he
had
an
automatic
right
to
a
transfer
and
so
he
appealed
the
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
court
of
appeals
decided
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
none
to
any
circuit
judge.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
he
had
unqualified
right.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
know
that
that
practice
is
followed
in
a
number
of
districts,
but
i
think
in
great
number
of
less
than
the
majority
of
districts.
we
do
not
have
an
exact
figure
on
the
number
of
districts
in
which
that
is
true,
and
it
is
also
true
as
we
discussed
with
the
court
in
hardy
against
united
states,
that
there
are
a
number
of
districts
in
which
when
there
is
a
request
for
a
transcript,
the
transcript
will
be
prepared
as
less
expensive
and
less
burdensome
than
litigating
the
question
of
access
to
the
transcript,
but
of
course
the
parameters
of
such
preparation
are
set
in
large
measured
by
the
statutory
requirements
and
the
constitutional
demands,
so
that
the
united
states’
attorneys
will
know
when
it
is
that
they
should
order
such
a
transcript
to
be
prepared.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
none
at
all,
your
honor
and
we
believe
that
the
28
u.s.c.
section
2250
would
require
it
to
be
given.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
contex,
the
legal
context
in
which
the
decision
is
made
in
not
to
resist
the
claim
for
a
transcript
depends
upon
statutes
and
the
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
decisions
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
boundaries
might
have
been
even
a
better
term,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
afraid
it
is
a
corruption
of
a
perfectly
good
scientific
term.
going
to
the
language
perhaps
is
one
of
these
weeds
of
language
that
crops
up
far
too
often.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
questions.
