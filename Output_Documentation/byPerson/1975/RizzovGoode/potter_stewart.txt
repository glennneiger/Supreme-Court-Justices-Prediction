justice
potter
stewart
but
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquistâ€™s
question
is
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought,
mr.
hearn
you
argued
--
am
i
mistaken
in
thinking
of
the
basic
decree
that
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
one
that
appears
from
20-a
to
23-a
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
decree,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
how
they
proposed
to
comply
with
this
decree?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
well,
i
do
not
ask
you
again
and
again,
but
just
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
in
thinking
that
what
appears
from
20-a
to
23-a
in
the
appendix
is
the
decree
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
petition
of
cert.
