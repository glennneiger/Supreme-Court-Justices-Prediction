mr.
peter
hearn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
no
point
in
their
presentation
today
do
the
petitioners
address
themselves
to
the
findings
which
judge
fullam
did
make.
to
the
contrary
they
blithely
and
incorrectly
assert
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
they
had
engaged
in
no
legal
wrongdoing.
however,
there
were
a
number
of
expressed
findings
upon
which
this
relief
was
predicated.
these
findings
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes
sir.
there
was
a
finding
that
they
engaged
in
a
policy
to
avoid
or
minimize
the
consequences
of
proven
police
misconduct.
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
on
page
124-a
of
the
appendix.
mr.
peter
hearn
mr.
justice
white,
the
premise
of
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
the
defendants
tolerated,
condoned
or
acquiesced
in
the
misconduct
of
those
under
their
supervision
and
control.
mr.
peter
hearn
well
the
finding
is
that
there
was
a
policy
to
avoid
or
minimize
the
consequences
of
proven
police
misconduct.
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
on
page
124-a.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes
sir.
the
finding
3
above
i
believe
addresses
itself
simply
to
a
policy
of
racial
bias,
and
i
believe
the
finding
to
which
i
have
just
adverted
in
number
5
has
to
deal
with
the
failure
to
do
anything
about
all
forms
of
illegal
conduct
by
police
officers
whether
it
is
the
application
of
excessive
force,
whether
it
is
a
question
of
illegal
arrest.
in
other
words
i
think
that
he
is
saying
in
number
3
that
there
is
no
expressed
racial
motivation
here.
but
i
believe
to
the
contrary
in
number
5
he
has
expressly
found
that
there
is
a
policy
of
condoning
this
unacceptably
high
number.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
there
was
evidence
beyond
the
scope
of
unconstitutional
conduct.
there
was
considerably
more
evidence
of
unconstitutional
conduct
than
my
brother
would
indicate
as
to
what
the
court
meant
by
this
term,
i
do
not
know.
but
certainly
our
case
is
grounded
upon
specific
findings
of
unconstitutional
activity
which
was
acquiesced
and
condoned
where
there
was
a
policy
to
minimize
or
avoid
the
consequences
by
those
who
were
conceded
and
found
to
be
in
position
of
supervision
and
control.
mr.
peter
hearn
i
think
that
we
can
get
some
glean
on
what
judge
fullam
intended
by
referring
to
page
130-a
where
he
concludes
toward
the
bottom
of
his
opinion
in
the
next
to
last
paragraph,
violations
of
constitutional
rights
by
police
do
occur
in
unacceptably
high
number
of
instances,
and
so
i
would
submit
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
he
is
talking
about
unconstitutional
acts
as
affording
the
underpinning,
the
basis
for
the
remedy
that
he
entered.
now
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
both
the
district
court
on
page
124-a
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
use
the
word
pattern.
as
i
have
said,
it
found
that
the
number
of
violations
was
unacceptably
high
and
with
respect
to
whether
they
were
two
years,
three
years
or
a
shorter
period,
in
the
goode
case
there
were
six
incidents
over
15
months
involving
just
two
police
officers.
in
the
coppar
case,
which
was
later
consolidated
with
the
case
in
which
i
was
counsel
originally,
there
were
28
incidents
over
the
period
of
five
months.
there
was
also
extensive
testimony
that
this
was
basically
a
tip
of
the
iceberg
problem
and
that
moreover
there
was
a
policy
by
the
department
to
discourage
the
filing
of
complaints
whereby
this
information
would
come
to
the
attention
of
the
senior
officers.
so
that
the
time
period,
i
submit,
is
much
greatly
reduced
over
what
was
indicated
to
the
court
earlier
and
that
indeed
there
was
a
greater
concentration
when
the
temporary
restraining
order
entered
by
judge
fullam
was
in
effect.
there
were
some
16
incidents
in
the
coppar
case
over
three-and-a-half
month
period
prior
to
the
entry
of
that
restraining
order
and
there
were
12
incidents
during
the
one-and-a-half
months
in
which
the
restraining
order
was
in
effect.
so
that
the
frequency
was
ascending
that
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
in
a
much
more
confined
period
and
as
i
have
said
the
period
of
concentration
was
greater
when
there
was
a
court
order
restraining
unconstitutional
activity.
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
it
was
entered
about
that
time.
i
do
not
believe
there
was
any
connection,
factual
connection
that
these
incidents
which
were
proven
did
not
grow
out
of
that
convention.
and
by
the
way
i
think
that
the
reference
to
one
sentence
in
the
complaint
of
the
case
that
was
later
consolidated
with
goode
to
the
reference
to
genocide
and
that
the
reference
to
the
6,000
advocates
of
violence
and
non-violence
who
were
coming
to
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
no
more
that
an
attempt
to
discredit
this
case
before
this
court.
in
fact,
as
we
have
attempted
to
point
out,
the
convention
itself
was
not
involved
in
these
incidents
and
more
over
it
was
attended
by
a
much
smaller
number
something
like
500
people.
it
was
entirely
peaceful
and
it
involved
largely
residents
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
i
believe
that
this
is
a
reference
published
by
a
governmental
advisory
commission
of
the
highest
order.
mr.
peter
hearn
well
--
oh,
yes
sir.
the
philadelphia
highway
patrol
is
a
part
of
the
philadelphia
police
department
and
one
of
the
defendants
here
in
both
cases
is
captain
murphy,
who
is
the
commander
of
the
highway
patrol
and
there
was
evidence
of
a
substantial
number
of
incidents
here
involving
highway
patrolmen
and
i
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
of
the
reference
to
it
by
judge
fullam.
now
--
mr.
peter
hearn
no
sir,
definitely
not.
it
is
--
i
am
going
mildly
outside
of
the
record
but
i
believe
it
is
an
elite
group
where
there
are
more
stringent
physical
requirements.
i
believe
it
is
considered
today
a
more
mobile,
a
more
forward,
aggressive
entity
as
a
part
of
the
department.
it
is
not
related
to
the
control
of
traffic
at
all.
it
does
have
the
right
to
arrest
for
speeding
and
alike,
but
--
mr.
peter
hearn
before
the
commission,
mr.
chief
justice?
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
am
not
entirely
certain
how
the
record
and
the
findings
of
the
commission
were
developed,
however.
mr.
peter
hearn
but
i
think
that
the
essential
point
that
the
petitioners
fail
to
understand
here
is
that
we
are
not
talking
about
a
right
to
the
procedure
which
is
set
forth
in
judge
fullam’s
decree.
that
is
the
remedy.
the
right
that
was
violated
was
the
acts
of
those
who
were
under
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
defendants.
the
remedy
is
what
judge
fullam
concluded
on
the
basis
of
his
findings
of
fact
and
his
consideration
of
the
entire
record
was
the
most
appropriate
but
mild
remedy
as
to
what
this
decree
does.
i
think
it
is
particularly
important
to
point
out
that
it
is
procedural
only.
this
decree
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
the
substantive
standards
are
that
are
applied
to
police
activities.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
who
decides.
this
is
police
judging
police.
all
that
this
decree
does
is
to
specify
that
there
will
be
complaint
forms
of
a
certain
kind
available,
that
they
will
be
distributed
at
certain
locations,
that
the
investigation
will
not
involve
what
the
facts
disclosed
where
the
inhibiting
element
of
the
chain
of
command,
that
there
would
be
a
six
month
statute
of
limitation
so
to
speak
relative
to
the
submission
of
these
complaints,
that
there
will
be
minimum
investigational
steps
and
minimal
time
periods,
that
anonymous
complaints
will
be
handled,
and
that
frivolous
complaints
will
be
screened
out.
there
is
a
procedure
for
eliminating
frivolous
complaints.
the
hearing
that
is
involved
only
if
there
is
a
dispute
on
the
facts
as
to
a
non-frivolous
complaint
and
finally
there
is
a
provision
that
records
will
be
kept
for
a
period
of
two
years.
mr.
peter
hearn
the
decision
maker
is
no
different.
the
decision
maker
is
the
commissioner
of
police
or
his
deputy
in
certain
cases
but
the
--
there
is
--
mr.
peter
hearn
no,
this
is
judge
fullam’s
directive
to
the
police
department.
he
said
that
they
were
to
author
a
program
which
would
be
addressed
to
the
general
problem
and
that
on
129-a
he
is
discussing
some
of
the
points
that
he
believes
--
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
correct
but
that
--
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
he
meant
that
the
evidence
showed
mr.
justice
white
that
district
commanders
that
would
be
somebody
running
a
police
station
or
precinct,
tended
to
inhibit
the
flow
of
the
complaint
if
it
were
made
in
that
district,
that
it
was
their
interest
to
not
report
complaints
about
what
was
--
mr.
peter
hearn
well
--
mr.
peter
hearn
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
because
the
decree
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
police,
that
it
is
the
police
commissioner.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
perhaps
i
could
illuminate,
mr.
justice
white,
this
was
a
general
directive
by
judge
fullam
but
i
submit
that
it
has
to
be
considered
along
with
the
decree
that
was
actually
entered
and
the
decree
makes
it
clear
beyond
any
doubt
that
there
is
no
change
whatsoever
in
the
designation
of
the
people
who
passed
judgment
on
this
conduct
so
that
it
is
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
hearn
following
--
mr.
peter
hearn
the
final
decree
is,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
as
modified,
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
other
words,
judge
fullam
directed
that
a
program
be
submitted
by
the
defendants
and
this
is
premised
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
defendants
in
which
we
fully
concur
that
with
mild
pressure
from
the
court
that
they
would
in
effect
put
their
house
in
order
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
the
remedy
that
he
ordered
but
this
case
was
not
tried
nor
was
it
the
plaintiffs’
contention
at
any
time
that
we
had
a
right
to
that.
the
right
that
we
are
claiming
is
not
to
have
violations
on
the
street
by
those
under
the
supervisions
and
control
of
the
defendants
in
unacceptably
--
mr.
peter
hearn
mr.
chief
justice,
i
disagree
with
your
wording
of
the
--
mr.
peter
hearn
--
of
the
last
paragraph,
because
i
believe
that
--
mr.
peter
hearn
no
sir,
i
do
not
disagree
with
what
you
read,
i
agree
with
your
interpretation,
because
i
believe
that
in
the
following
sentence,
he
goes
on
to
say
what
the
court
has
decided
is
that
under
existing
circumstances
violation
of
constitutional
rights
by
police
do
occur
in
unacceptably
high
number
of
instances,
and
in
the
absence
of
change
and
procedures
such
violations
are
likely
to
continue
to
occur
and
that
revision
of
procedures
for
handling
civilian
complaints
is
a
necessary
first
step
in
attempting
to
prevent
future
abuses.
mr.
peter
hearn
no
sir,
i
believe
it
is
not,
and
i
believe
that
the
school
desegregation
cases
are
examples
of
remedies
fashioned
to
achieved
a
right
--
mr.
peter
hearn
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
factual
parallel
but
as
it
relates
to
interplay
between
right
and
remedy,
i
believe
that
it
is
a
comparable
to
the
reapportionment
cases
and
to
the
desegregation
cases.
that
1983,
section
1983
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
this
court
said
in
monroe
versus
pape,
includes
or
involves,
brings
with
in
its
sphere
under
the
rubric
of
color
of
state
law,
those
state
officials
who
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
enforce
a
state
law,
and
that
this
is
what
the
unconstitutional
activity
is,
and
that
--
the
court
had
before
it
a
number
of
possibilities.
it
could
have
entered
an
injunction
of
the
sort
that
it
had
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
for
a
shot
period
of
time
which
is
much
like
the
decree
in
allee
versus
medrano,
which
simply
says,
you
may
not
engage
in
unconstitutional
activity
henceforth.
but
i
submit
that
that
leads
to
exactly
to
thing
that
courts
should
seek
to
avoid
and
that
is
the
bringing
in,
hauling
in
to
court
of
specific
police
officers
to
stand
under
the
test
of
hindsight
for
some
act
that
they
might
have
done
at
the
10th
and
south
street
on
a
particular
night.
mr.
peter
hearn
if
there
was
a
willful
failure
to
do
something
mandated
by
the
order,
i
submit
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
would
be
appropriate
for
a
contempt
proceeding
but
there
is
also
a
retention
of
jurisdiction
here
and
that
if
the
defendants,
at
any
time
for
any
of
the
reasons
that
they
argue
here
in
many
instances
for
the
first
time,
make
this
order
unworkable,
then
they
can
go
back,
they
can
present
to
judge
fullam
evidence
about
the
impact
on
the
operations
room
which
they
claim
here
but
never
claimed
below
and
never
produced
on
any
evidence
on
below,
and
he
would
consider
that
and
make
a
finding
and
if
he
thought
that
it
were
proper
contention
and
that
we
did
not
have
any
evidence
contrary
that
was
properly
cognizable
that
he
would
make
a
finding
and
modify
his
order.
this
procedure
allows
for
exactly
the
working
out
of
these
elements
of
mechanical
difficulty
shall
i
say,
as
the
decree
goes
along.
mr.
peter
hearn
assuming,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
contention
tha
the
plaintiffs
in
such
a
case
would
make
is
unconstitutional
and
i
am
not
prepared
that
--
mr.
peter
hearn
then
i
would
submit
that
the
court
could
formulate
relief
which
it
concluded
would
most
likely
to
avoid
a
recurrence
of
the
unconstitutional
practice.
now,
certainly
the
type
of
order
that
you
contemplate
which
goes
into
an
entire
revision
of
the
process
--
mr.
peter
hearn
i
believe
it
is.
i
believe
this
is
a
very
--
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
but
of
course
the
specific
decree
i
think
is
the
one
that
would
govern
more
so
than
that
language
i
think
that
that
language
i
think
is
predicated
upon
in
great
part
a
procedure
endorsed
in
the
yale
law
journal
which
was
cited,
i
believe,
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
allee
with
respect
to
allowing
the
defendants
to
develop
the
program
to
assume
their
good
faith
in
this
situation.
mr.
peter
hearn
well
sir,
i
understood
the
reference
to
be
approving
but
i
could
be
incorrect,
but
the
point
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
the
procedure
was
drafted
by
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here
initially.
all
of
that
reference
to
the
circulation
of
various
colored
documents
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
numbered
directive.
this
says,
directive
127.
mr.
peter
hearn
the
format
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
then
we
submitted
using
their
format
certain
proposed
revisions
and
we
expanded
the
scope
of
investigation
and
made
certain
other
procedural
of
steps
along
the
line,
but
the
all
of
the
great
specificity
that
you
are
referring
to,
the
fact
that
we
have
what,
i
submit,
appears
to
be
something
that
it
is
not,
and
that
is
a
federal
district
judge
telling
a
police
department
that
the
goldenrod
copy
goes
to
the
operations
division
or
something
of
that
sort,
that
is
simply
not
involved.
this
was
an
effort
to
--
mr.
peter
hearn
it
is
involved
in
it
but
this
was
just
like
in
the
school
desegregation
cases.
this
was
a
plan
developed
by
the
people
that,
i
submit,
are
best
able
to
do
it.
mr.
peter
hearn
they
did
not
volunteer
but
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
this
is
the
most
appropriate
form
of
remedy
here.
there
is
some
coercion
involved
when
you
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
that
is
right,
i
agree.
when
you
have
a
record
such
as
the
findings
here
of
unconstitutional
activity,
i
think
that
it
is
appropriate
and
indeed
the
duty
of
the
federal
district
court
to
do
something,
and
the
question
here
is
did
it
go
about
in
the
least
intrusive
--
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
peter
hearn
i
agree
with
that
and
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
correct.
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
have
also
--
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
the
decree.
and
we
have
also
included
in
the
appendix
the
original
proposal
of
the
defendants
--
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
right,
and
then
judge
fullam’s
changes
to
it.
we
try
to
present
a
record
for
your
consideration
as
to
how
the
decree
evolved,
yes,
sir?
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
hearn
it
is
a
part
of
a
decree.
mr.
peter
hearn
oh,
i
am
sorry,
that
is
correct.
i
was
addressing
to
its
location
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
yes
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
on
page
20-a
mr.
justice
stewart
substantially
in
the
form
set
forth
there
and
nowhere
in
the
decree
is
there.
a
reference
to
matters
that
i
believe
have
troubled
this
court
before
such
as
whether
training
weaponry
or
alike
are
involved
or
whether
there
is
any
kind
of
violation
of
questions
of
comity
or
a
state
of
criminal
procedure,
none
of
this
questions
are
involved
here.
mr.
peter
hearn
no,
sir.
i
think
it
is
much
less
comprehensive,
much
more
limited
and
restrained
that
it
is
--
mr.
peter
hearn
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
he
has
found
that
there
is
a
violation,
a
pattern
of
violations
of
constitutional
rights
which
occurred
in
an
unacceptably
--
mr.
peter
hearn
he
orders
it
as
a
remedy,
sir.
not
because
there
is
a
right
to
that
particular
procedure.
there
is
not,
and
we
contend
there
is
not,
just
like,
and
i
do
refer
to
the
school
desegregation
cases
among
others,
as
situations
where
courts
are
faced
with
the
terribly
difficult
question
of
trying
to
have
an
impact,
trying
to
relieve
the
violations
that
it
found
to
occur
and
do
so
in
the
least
of
intrusive
way.
mr.
peter
hearn
in
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class
that
they
where
represent
which
is
--
mr.
peter
hearn
the
class
is
all
citizens
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
the
--
mr.
peter
hearn
there
was
no
expressed
findings
that
is
limited
to
those
whose
rights
have
been
violated
but
the
judge
held
that
violations
of
rights
of
the
members
of
this
class
occur
in
an
unacceptably
high
number
of
instances
and
where
likely
to
recur
unless
there
was
the
imposition
of
some
appropriate
federal
remedy.
mr.
peter
hearn
thank
you,
thank
you
sir.
