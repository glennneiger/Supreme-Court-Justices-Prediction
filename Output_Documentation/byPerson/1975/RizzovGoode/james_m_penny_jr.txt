mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
you
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
concerns
the
propriety
of
the
entry
of
mandatory
injunctive
relief
where
the
district
court
expressly
found
that
the
defendants
had
not
violated
plaintiff’s
constitutional
rights,
where
there
was
no
continuing
course
of
conduct
to
enjoin,
and
where
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
of
law.
this
case
is
before
this
court
in
consolidated
form.
it
originated
as
two
separate
cases
filed
and
tried
for
the
most
part
in
1970.
they
were
consolidated
in
1973
by
the
district
judge
for
purposes
of
relief.
the
plaintiffs
are
essentially
the
same
individual
plaintiffs
suing
on
behalf
of
the
class
of
all
philadelphia
citizens
and
on
behalf
of
the
specifically
included
class
of
all
philadelphia’s
black
citizens.
the
defendants
also
are
essentially
the
same.
they
are
the
mayor,
the
police
commissioner,
and
the
managing
director
of
philadelphia
and
in
addition,
a
police
captain.
the
class
plaintiffs
averred
that
the
defendants,
these
defendant
city
officials,
had
engaged
upon
a
course
of
conduct
of
the
basest,
lowest
form
of
racial
discrimination.
the
averment
was
that
these
city
officials
had
made
a
conscious
decision
to
deprive
a
segment
of
philadelphia’s
society
of
their
basic
constitutional
freedoms.
it
was
averred
that
genocide
was
the
goal
that
now
mayor
rizzo
had
actually
planned
and
was
attempting
to
carry
out
the
extermination
of
philadelphia’s
black
community.
and
the
vehicle
for
carrying
out
this
plan
was
supposedly
the
philadelphia
police
department,
whose
officers,
it
was
alleged,
were
ordered,
directed
and
encouraged
to
trample
upon
the
constitutional
rights
of
philadelphia’s
citizens,
and
in
particular,
philadelphia’s
black
citizens.
after
21
days
of
testimony
and
after
250
witnesses
or
approximately
250
witnesses,
the
court
was
forced
to
conclude
that
on
those
allegations
plaintiffs
utterly
failed
to
prove
their
case.
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
policy
of
racial
discrimination.
there
was
no
policy
to
violate
constitutional
rights.
the
court
refused
to
find
that
any
defendant
violated
any
constitutional
right
of
any
class
plaintiff
or
any
individual
plaintiff.
additionally,
aside
from
the
claims
of
palpably
unconstitutional
conduct,
plaintiffs
in
the
goode
case
averred
that
the
police
department’s
internal
disciplinary
procedures
for
disciplining
police
officers
were,
and
in
their
words,
inadequate.
they
averred
they
had
a
right
and
a
need
to
adequate
administrative
procedures
internal
to
the
police
department
and
they
demanded
a
remedy
in
the
form
of
the
adoption
of
their
scheme
for
their,
in
their
words,
adequate
internal
procedures.
the
court
heard
evidence
on
this
issue
and
decided
that
the
police
department’s
procedures
were
indeed
inadequate,
in
terms
of
disciplining
police
officers
and
in
terms
of
receiving
citizen
complaints.
yet
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
pointed
out
that
there
was
absolutely
no
constitutional
right
in
the
plaintiffs
or
in
the
class
plaintiffs
to
have
any
improved
procedures.
essentially
the
basic
question
is
whether
a
citizen
has
a
constitutional
right
enforceable
in
the
federal
courts
for
his
elected
officials
and
his
elected
officials’
appointees
to
act
wisely
or
adequately
or
efficiently
and
the
court
said,
no,
they
do
not
have
that
right.
but
nevertheless
the
relief
was
entered
and
it
was
entered
because
the
court
heard
evidence
and
made
findings
regarding
separate,
individual,
independent
incidents
of
police
misconduct.
there
are
approximately
38-40
introduced
at
trial.
the
court
made
findings
and
it
is
not
entirely
clear
from
the
court’s
opinion
but
it
appears
that
on
approximately
25
of
these
incidents
the
court
concluded
that
the
police
officers
involved
who
are
not
defendants
did
act
unconstitutionally
towards
these
individual
citizens.
the
question
--
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
in
the
coppar
case
there
--
on
two
of
the
incidents
the
court
made
a
finding.
i
think
one;
he
characterized
the
police
action
as
an
overreaction.
that
was
in
the
locke
and
perry
incident
where
the
finding
was
that
the
police
officer
had
a
bucket
of
water
thrown
on
him
from
the
third
floor
when
he
was
checking
out
a
stolen
car
and
then
the
police
went
in
and
did
overreact.
the
other
one
was
the
brown
and
smalley
incident
where,
i
believe
he
used
the
words,
the
police
acted
unreasonably,
although
he
did
not
use
the
words
unconstitutionally.
i
am
--
when
i
said
approximately
25
incidents
i
am
just
giving
the
best
estimate
that
you
could,
out
of
the
whole
case,
find
maybe
25
incidents
or
so
where
there
was
conduct
which
is
arguably
unconstitutional.
i
do
not
say
that
judge
fullam
concluded
that
in
25
incidents.
judge
fullam’s
conclusions
as
to
unconstitutionality,
i
believe,
only
go
to
the
six
of
the
incidents
in
the
goode
case.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
no
your
honor,
the
changes
have
not
been
implemented
as
far
as
i
know.
i
have
not
checked
on
it
but
i
do
not
believe
i
would
be
stating
the
facts
in
all
candor
if
i
said
they
were.
i
do
not
think
there
have
been.
the
court
found
on
the
basis
of
these
individual
sporadic
incidents
of
conduct,
these
25
or
so
incidents,
that
they
had
occurred
in
the
past
and
that
in
the
future
sporadic
incidents
also
would
occur.
and
the
question
is
assuming
that
a
remedy
can
be
awarded
in
the
absence
of
a
right
and
you
must
remember
that
the
district
court
refused
to
find
that
the
defendants,
these
defendant
city
officials,
had
embarked
upon
any
policy
to
violate
anyone’s
constitutional
rights.
but
assuming
that
a
remedy
is
proper,
some
remedy,
the
question
is
whether
the
court’s
prediction
that
these
individual
incidents
will
occur
in
the
future,
on
a
part
of
persons,
not
defendants,
presents
an
inappropriate
case
for
the
entry
of
mandatory
injunctive
relief.
now
generally
i
believe
that
for
a
single
act
or
an
independent
act
in
violation
of
one’s
constitutional
rights
by
another
one
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
the
typical
remedy
is
damages.
however,
if
a
plaintiff
establishes
a
continuing
course
of
conducts,
something
that
is
violating
his
constitutional
rights
and
immediately
threatens
to
violate
his
constitutional
rights
in
the
future,
then
that
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
have
that
conduct
stopped.
but
here
we
have
25
incidents
involving
30
police
officers
strung
out
over
a
period
of
three
years
where
the
court
found
in
that
same
period
that
there
were
300,000
arrests.
during
that
period
of
time
there
were
approximately
8,000
police
officers
and
there
are
literally
millions
of
police-citizen
interactions
which
do
not
amount
to
arrest.
the
plaintiffs
not
only
failed
to
establish
a
course
of
conduct
to
be
enjoined,
they
failed
to
establish
a
pattern
of
conduct.
we
have
25
incidents,
each
one
against
--
if
properly
pleaded
against
the
appropriate
defendant
may
well
be
eligible
for
damage
relief.
you
put
them
together
in
one
case,
you
still
have
30
separate
incidents
without
a
single
unifying
characteristic,
other
than
you
have
philadelphia
police
officers
who,
i
do
not
think
in
this
case,
are
acting
any
differently,
and
i
think
as
the
judge
found,
the
case
is
typical
of
most
urban
police
departments
that
in
the
course
of
events,
in
the
course
of
happenings,
unconstitutional
actions
by
police
officers
do
occur.
we
see
this
in
bad
arrests.
we
see
this
in
violation
of
rights
and
arrests,
it
happens.
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
it.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
i
think
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
judge
fullam’s
opinion
that
there
were
incidents
here
which
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
certain
persons.
however,
the
perpetrators
of
that
conduct
were
not
defendants,
they
are
individual
police
officers.
and
there
was
no
thread
running
through
this
conduct.
there
was
no
motivation
behind
it;
there
was
nothing
directing
it.
and
that
is
what
separates
this
case
from
allee
versus
medrano,
from
hague
versus
the
cio,
from
lankford
versus
gelston
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
was
cited
by
this
court
in
allee,
where
each
of
one
of
those
cases
involved
a
policy
determination
by
police
or
municipal
officials
that
we
are
going
to
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
certain
people.
we
are
going
to
run
the
farm
workers
out
of
the
rio
grand
valley.
we
are
going
to
run
to
cio
out
of
jersey
city.
we
are
going
to
search
the
homes
of
black
citizens
based
on
anonymous
tips.
we
are
going
to
do
it.
and
the
court
comes
in;
it
sees
that
conduct
and
says,
no,
you
are
not,
you
stop
it.
here
there
is
nothing
to
stop.
the
attempt
and
the
hope
of
this
relief
is
that
maybe
this
future
unknown
acts
that
are
specific
yet
we
do
not
know
who
they
are
going
to
be
perpetrated
by,
who
the
victim
is,
when
they
are
going
to
occur,
where
they
are
going
to
occur,
how
they
are
going
to
occur
or
why
they
occur
or
whether
they
are
going
to
occur
except
that
the
court
did
find
that
that
was
probable
that
it
would
occur
but
it
is
still
guess
work.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
over
the
course
of
the
three
year
period?
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
i
think
i
could
--
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
true
also,
your
honor.
i
think
--
the
circuit
court
used
the
term
pattern.
i
do
not
believe
judge
fullam
did
but
i
think
the
circuit
court
used
the
term
pattern
of
police
abuse
was
established.
but
as
i
understand
the
word
pattern,
it
is
an
outgrowth
of
title
vii
where
congress
has
said,
you
do
not
have
to
show
an
intentional
policy
to
do
anything
to
discriminate
in
your
employment.
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
the
effect
of
your
existing
policies
and
if
the
effect
of
those
existing
policies
is
to
demonstrate
a
pattern
of
conduct
statistically
then
the
courts
will
do
something
about
it,
but
there
was
no
similar
provision
in
1983.
there
is
no
pattern
here.
there
is
no
clear
and
imminent
threat
which
can
should
be
or
can
be
enjoined.
the
question
as
to
who,
when,
where,
how,
and
why
are
unanswered
in
the
record
and
they
are
answerable.
and
the
failure
--
and
this
remedy,
as
i
said,
only
hopes
to
stop
future
unknown
acts.
we
do
not
if
it
will
or
not
and
the
reason
we
do
not
know
is
because
it
does
not
go
to
any
unconstitutional
conduct.
unless
you
are
prepared
to
say
that
inadequate
procedures
are
in
themselves
unconstitutional.
then
the
remedy
and
--
the
district
court
was
not
prepared
to
say
that,
the
circuit
court
was
not
prepared
to
say
that,
then
the
remedy
does
not
enjoin
anything
that
is
unconstitutional.
it
just
substitutes
the
court’s
judgment
on
the
adequacy
of
internal
police
department’s
administrative
procedures.
now,
plaintiffs
concede
that
it
is
impossible
to
frame
injunctive
relief
which
would
stop
the
constitutional
violation
shown
in
this
case,
which
would
stop
this
future
various
and
independent
acts.
the
reason
is
not
because
of
anything
unique
to
the
police
department.
it
is
not
unique
to
this
case
or
to
the
defendants
in
this
case.
the
reason
is
because
of
a
fundamental
failure
in
the
plaintiff’s
case,
i.e.
they
failed
to
prove
the
underlying
policy.
they
failed
to
prove
the
continuing
course
of
unconstitutional
conduct.
they
failed
to
prove
the
existence
of
something
which
could
be
enjoined.
and
the
real
impossibility
of
framing
such
injunctive
relief,
in
view
of
this
fundamental
fault
in
their
case,
comes
to
the
floor
when
you
understand
that
they
have
attempted
to
present
these
unrelated
incidents
of
police
conduct.
for
this
purpose,
to
create
and
an
injunctive
decree
which
will
preserve
for
all
time
and
for
all
people
in
every
conceivable
right
existing
under
the
constitution
from
violation
for
any
police
officer,
because
there
is
no
definition
of
the
rights
here,
there
is
no
definition
of
who,
when,
where,
how,
and
why.
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
no
your
honor.
in
fact,
judge
fullam
says
that
it
is
rather
typical
of
any
urban
police
force
at,
i
believe,
it
is
on
page
123
of
the
appendix.
a
review
of
this
material
suggested
the
problems
disclosed
by
the
record
in
the
present
case
are
not
new
and
are
fairly
typical
of
the
problems
afflicting
the
police
departments
in
major
urban
areas.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is
--
yes
your
honor,
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
after
the
succession
of
citations
to
various
treatises
and
commission
reports.
because
of
the
failure
of
the
plaintiffs
to
establish
the
existence
of
any
conduct
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
city
officials
in
this
case,
and
as
i
said
the
court
--
in
view
of
the
allegations
the
court
was
forced
to
make
that
statement
that
there
were
no
policy.
mandatory
injunctive
relief
is
inappropriate,
first
of
all,
because
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
court,
because
it
is
just
fundamental
that
where
you
fail
to
establish
a
right
against
the
defendant
you
cannot
have
a
remedy.
secondly,
it
is
even
assuming
that
a
remedy
would
be
appropriate
there
was
nothing
here
to
enjoin;
there
was
no
conduct,
it
is
just
a
guess
work.
thank
you,
your
honors.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
correct
a
misconception.
the
defendants
did
not
come
close
to
drafting
the
decree
or
the
appendix
to
the
decree.
what
happened
was
on
march
14
of
1973,
the
district
court
entered
the
opinion,
a
long
opinion
which
is
set
out
in
the
printed
appendix.
the
court
ordered
the
defendants
to
submit
a
program.
now,
the
order
was
unappealable
and
as
the
court
recognizes
and
mentioned
several
times
at
various
points
in
the
record.
we
have
objected
to
the
right
of
the
court
on
this
record
to
enter
any
decree
but
nevertheless
we
could
not
appealed
on
that
time
and
we,
in
good
faith,
comply
with
the
court
order.
we
submitted
a
proposal.
that
proposal
was
four
pages
long
and
had
four
pages
of
forms
attached,
three
pages
of
schematic
designs
and
the
fourth
page
was
a
form
for
the
citizen
complaint
form
itself.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
no
that
is
eight
pages
total.
it
is
eight
pages
total,
four
pages
of
flowcharts
and
forms
and
four
pages
of
a
directive.
the
court’s
directive
is
14
pages
long
exclusive
of
any
flowcharts
and
forms,
they
are
not
there.
that
we
had
--
we
submitted
something
and
it
was
totally
unlike
what
the
court
eventually
implemented.
i
want
to
address
the
right
versus
remedy
issue.
this
case
can
be
construed
in
two
ways.
either
the
court
entered
relief
because
it
did
determine
that
the
procedures
were
inadequate
and
despite
what
it
said
about
not
having
a
constitutional
right
to
adequacy
decided
to
render
them
adequate
anyhow
or
the
court
decided
that
the
defendants
could
be
held
liable
despite
the
court’s
conclusion
that
they
had
not
violated
the
constitution.
in
either
of
those
two
events,
the
relief,
the
remedy
is
thoroughly
improper.
it
is
either
a
remedy
without
a
right
or
it
is
a
remedy
where
the
court
recognizes
it
does
not
have
a
right
to
question
the
wisdom
of
the
executive
branches
of
local
government.
as
for
the
inadequacy
it
has
been
asserted
to
you
that
it
was
only
raised
in
the
question
of
a
remedy.
paragraph
18
of
the
goode
complaint,
inadequacy
is
alleged,
paragraphs
49
to

the
need
for
a
mandatory
injunction
in
the
form
of
adequate
procedures
and
the
right
to
relief
in
that
form,
at
page
21-a,
paragraph
2
a
and
b
of
their
wherefore
clause
demanding
relief,
they
demand
revision
on
the
procedures.
these
procedures
and
the
disciplinary
procedures
did
not
arise
back
in
1973
they
have
been
in
this
case
since
the
beginning,
that
was
the
reason
this
suit
was
filed.
as
far
as
the
analogy
with
the
school
desegregation
cases
in
everyone
of
those
cases
there
is
a
policy
of
unconstitutional
conduct
which
is
stopped
immediately.
to
paraphrase
one
of
this
court’s
opinions
the
relief
will
halt
segregation
and
we
will
halt
it
now,
and
the
same
with
reapportionment
cases.
there
was
nothing
equivalent
here.
this
decree
does
not
enjoin
anything
other
than
what
the
court
deems
is
inadequate.
we
do
not
know
if
it
is
ever
going
to
prevent
any
unconstitutional
conduct
because
we
do
not
know
what
the
court
is
talking
about
other
than
something
will
happen
in
the
future.
there
were
some
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
court,
where
the
court
said,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
department
to
discourage
the
filing
of
such
complaints
to
avoid
or
minimize
their
consequences
of
proven
misconduct
and
to
resist
disclosure
of
the
final
disposition
of
such
complaints.
this
was
brought
up
to
the
court
at
the
beginning
of
mr.
hearn’s
remarks
stating
that
that
is
a
policy
determination
by
the
court.
i
believe,
it
seems
they
are
to
be
somewhat
irreconcilable,
yes,
irreconcilable
with
paragraph
three
of
the
findings
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
chief
justice.
but
if
you
turn
to
page
128-a
of
the
appendix,
it
is
explained
that
what
the
court
is
talking
about
there
is
that
policies
of
the
department,
meaning
the
procedures
of
the
department
had
the
result
of
minimizing
and
discouraging
the
complaints.
their
complaints
are
handled
on
a
“chain
of
command
basis”
and
these
results
in
the
tendency
to
minimize
and
discourage
complaints.
so
when
the
court
said
that
–
talking
about
the
policy
to
minimize
complaints,
it
was
not
talking
about
a
willful
policy
in
the
part
of
the
department
to
discourage
complaints,
but
it
was
talking
about
was
the
end
result
of
the
duly
authorized
departmental
policies.
finally,
mr.
hearn’s
remarks
mention
that
the
effected
decree
is
actually
very
mild,
and
he
says,
if
we
want
to
change
or
if
we
cannot
leave
with
it,
well
we
can
go
back
to
the
court.
well,
we
should
not
have
to
go
back
to
court.
a
mandatory
injunction
is
always
harsh.
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
form
of
judicial
remedy,
and
in
this
case,
it
results
in
the
district
court
taking
power
to
itself
which
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
place
elsewhere.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
yes
your
honor
i
believe
--
well,
first
of
all
this
only
goes
to
complaints
which
do
not
allege
a
criminal
conduct.
if
the
complaint
alleges
criminal
conduct,
it
is
elsewhere,
and
when
i
say
criminal
conduct
i
am
not
sure
if
the
judge
intended
to
subsume
federal
criminal
conduct
which
may
take
this
case
out
of
all
civil
rights
violations
also.
but
wherein
a
non-frivolous,
non-criminal
complaint
there
is
a
factual
dispute.
the
case
is
supposed
to
be
moved
to
a
substantially
altered
police
board
of
inquiry,
which
is
to
conduct
hearings
for
the
purpose
of
resolving
the
issues
and
determining
the
liability
of
the
officers.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
complainant
has
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
to
cross
examine
the
police
officers.
there
is
a
stenographic
record
taken,
and
it
is
available
to
any
complainant
so
long
as
he
averse
a
case
where
there
is
a
factual
dispute.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
very
new
your
honor.
what
the
court
has
done
here,
and
i
tried
to
point
this
out
in
the
brief,
is
create
a
system
which
is
a
mere
image
of
a
court.
the
police
department’s
regulations
are
designed
to
--
or
disciplinary
regulations
are
designed
to
go
at
violations
of
police
regulations.
they
were
never
designed
to
provide
an
open
forum
for
people
who
have
complaints
about
the
police
department.
it
is
a
disciplinary
tool
and
it
involves
the
police
officer
and
his
relation
to
the
department.
under
the
existing
procedures
the
complainant
has
no
right
to
counsel,
he
has
no
right
to
demand
a
hearing,
and
he
has
no
right
to
accuse
or
to
confront
the
accused
in
the
present
situation.
though,
i
believe
he
does
have
this
right
under
the
court’s
decree.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
i
do
not
imagine
that
judge
fullam
would
require
the
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
rights.
it
does
present
a
severe
hardship
to
the
police
officer
who
is,
on
the
one
hand,
a
defendant
in
a
civil
suit
for
damages,
and
on
the
other
hand,
must
submit
to
this
procedure
within
the
police
department
and
this
procedure
contemplated
by
judge
fullam.
mr.
james
m.
penny,
jr.
that
is
precisely
my
point
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
stenographic
record
taken
and
he
would
be
testifying
under
oath.
i
think
it
is
the
best
form
of
discovery
available
for
any
civil
rights
plaintiff.
he
has
to
file
the
complaint
and
go
to
the
department
and
get
everything
he
wants.
it
certainly
puts
the
department
or
the
police
officer
to
severe
disadvantage
in
the
subsequent
civil
rights
suit
for
damages.
one
further
point
mr.
chief
justice
with
your
example
regarding
the
assessors,
this
relief
goes
far
further
because
with
at
least
the
assessors
you
have
a
finite
number
of
homes.
there
is
only
a
certain
number
of
properties
to
assess
and
there
is
only
a
certain
number
of
problems
that
could
arise,
but
with
the
police
department
there
is
literally
an
almost
infinite
number
of
chances
for
something
to
occur.
i
think
the
scope
of
this
is
far
beyond
your
example
of
the
assessors
and
this
is
an
extremely,
extremely
substantial
interference
with
the
rights
of
the
police
department
on
the
rights
of
the
defendant
of
city
officials
here
where
the
court
has
refused
to
find
that
they
have
violated
anyone’s
constitutional
rights
and
repeats
that,
says
that
twice
during
its
opinion.
i
thank
you,
your
honors.
