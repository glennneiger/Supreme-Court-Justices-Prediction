we
will
hear
argument
next
in
74-942,
rizzo
against
goode.
if
counsels
in
united
states
against
foster
lumber
company
are
standing
by
they
maybe
excused
for
today
if
they
wish.
mr.
penny,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
suffice
to
say
that
with
8,000
policemen
operating
in
a
large
city
in
metropolitan
area
that
you
could
concede
that
that
25
incidents
or
30
incidents
of
violations
would
occur
in
the
same
time
span.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
rather
remarkable
if
it
was
that
low?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
penny.
mr.
hearn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
some
point
would
you
juxtapose
that
with
finding
number
3
above
and
suggest
what
you
think
the
relationship
is,
the
finding
that
the
evidence
does
not
disclose
any
conscious
departmental
policy
of
racial
bias
or
discriminatory
enforcement
on
racial
alliance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hearn,
before
you
go
on,
i
note
in
the
court’s
opinion
that
it
refers
to
some
very
general
matters
here.
it
recites
the
president’s
commission
on
law
enforcement
at
page
123-a,
referring
president
johnson’s
commission
of
1967,
described
the
philadelphia
highway
patrol
as
a
skull-cracking
division
and
then
it
gives
some
citation.
can
you
enlighten
me
on
how
something
that
happened
several
years
before
with
a
different
police
department
has
any
relevance
to
this,
to
the
findings
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assume
that
it
is
entirely
correct
that
the
philadelphia
highway
patrol
indeed
was
guilty
of
having
a
skull-cracking
division,
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
the
philadelphia
police
department?
are
the
two
connected
in
some
way
or
are
they
under
the
same
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
procedures
of
that
inquiry
were
not
adversary
in
any
sense,
were
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hearn
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit
for
the
last
paragraph
of
judge
fullam’s
opinion.
you
attached
your
case
here
on
constitutional
grounds,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
mr.
judge
fullam
masters
67
pages
of
writing
a
very
comprehensive
opinion,
says,
“in
conclusion,
it
should
be
emphasized
that
this
court
has
not
decided
that
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent
have
a
constitutional
right
to
improved
departmental
procedures
for
handling
civilian
complaints
against
police.”
and
yet
that
is
precisely
the
relief
that
he
ordered,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
at
this
stage
on
review,
we
are
not
concerned
precisely
or
particularly
with
what
you
have
asked
but
on
what
the
court
decided.
you
cast
it
on
constitutional
grounds;
the
court
granted
some
relief,
while
at
the
same
time
conceding
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
the
relief.
now,
that
leaves
only
--
at
least
i
suggest
to
you,
is
it
not
his
fallback
provision
that
this
must
be
under
some
supervisory
jurisdiction
if
it
is
not
constitutional,
and
he
is
exercising
a
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
a
state,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
tell
me
what
it
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
you
disagree
with
what
i
read
from
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
an
entirely
logical
extension
of
the
part
that
i
read,
but
where
does
the
united
states
district
judge,
what
is
the
source
of
his
authority
to
impose
a
supervisory
power
over
a
state
or
a
municipal
government
in
these
circumstances?
is
it
not
his
power
limited
for
granting
damages
or
injunctions,
and
in
the
ordinary
sense,
stops
doing
something?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
is
a
parallel
to
desegregation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hearn,
just
let
me
follow
this
analogy.
suppose
the
people
in
philadelphia
came
to
the
federal
judge
fullam
and
said,
the
local
assessor
is
following
improper
practices
in
assessments
of
real
state,
favoring
some
people
over
others,
and
thereby
inflicting
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection.
and
the
judge
heard
all
the
evidence
--
was
valued
at
to
25%
more
than
another
house
that
he,
the
judge
concluded
was
of
the
same
value
and
that
he
found
25
or
50
or
1250
illustrations
of
that.
do
you
think
the
judge
would
have
the
power
to
order
the
assessor
or
the
country
or
the
municipality
to
make
up
a
new
set
of
regulations
as
to
how
they
should
go
about
the
assessment
of
their
properties
for
tax
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean
suppose
the
matter
of
equal
protection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
very
much
different
from
what
you
have
got
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
to
paraphrase
them,
just
to
paraphrase
them,
just
to
simply
say
that
you
have
got
to
improve
your
procedure
for
handling
assessments
of
real
estate
under
your
statutes
substituting
real
estate
for
police
complaints
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
you
cite
the
law
review
article
because
we
do
not
endorse
it
and
not
because
we
endorse
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
all
of
that
flows
from
the
paragraph
which
begins
with
his
statement
that
he
has
not
decided
that
there
is
any
constitutional
right
but
nevertheless
he
is
going
to
order
them
to
improve
their
procedures
and
then
the
product
of
that
juridical
declaration
is
a
final
judgment
that
is
contained
from
20
to
page
37-a.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
improved
departmental
procedures
which
he
then
proceeds
to
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
hearn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
penny?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
decree,
would
the
policeman
still
be
entitled
to
assert
fifth
amendment
rights
or
is
that
gone
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
all
seriousness,
i
supposed
his
answers
would
be
admissible
against
him
in
a
civil
suit
for
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

judgment
and
opinion
