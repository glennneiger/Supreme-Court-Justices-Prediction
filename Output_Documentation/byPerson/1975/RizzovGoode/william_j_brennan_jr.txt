what
about
the
procedures
that
are
at
133-a
about
145
in
the
letter
to
judge
fullam,
by
mr.
mcnally,
are
those
--
were
they
are
acceptable
or
accepted
or
what?
these
are
the
procedures
that
as
i
read
this
letter
intended
to
comply
with
the
decree
of
march
14.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
have
they
been
made
effective?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
basically,
what
you
are
arguing,
i
take
it,
is
there
has
been
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
equitable
remedies
therefore
indicated,
those
within
the
discretion
on
the
first
instance
of
the
trial
judge,
that
in
this
instance,
he
accepted
some
suggestions
or
considerable,
i
gather,
from
the
defendants
as
to
how
they
could
bring
about
the
kind
of
remedy
that
he
had
in
mind.
that
was
then
revised
and
then
he
adopted
the
whole
work.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
are
saying
that
was
all
within
the
equitable
jurisdiction
of
district
judges
to
fashion
remedies
whether
there
has
been
a
finding
of
violation
of
constitutional
rights.
