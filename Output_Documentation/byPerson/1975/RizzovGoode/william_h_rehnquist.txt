justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
noticed
in
the
judge
fullam’s
opinion
that
in
the
goode
case
he
makes
specific
findings
with
respect
to
several
of
those
incidents
indeed
this
was
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
the
plaintiff’s
rights.
but
in
the
coppar
case
i
do
not
find
those
specific
findings.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hearn.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
read
the
word
police
misconduct
in
that
finding
5
that
you
just
referred,
as
being
the
equivalent
of
constitutional
violations
or
as
embracing
something
more
than
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
judge
fullam
then
followed
your
theory
of
the
case
or
in
order
to
have
his
findings
support
your
theory,
you
would
have
to
read
misconduct
to
mean
constitutional
violations
in
that
finding,
would
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
any
of
that
concentration
was
due
to
the
black
panther
convention
activity
in
september
of
that
year?
i
believe
that
was
why
the
restraining
order
was
initially
entered,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
of
the
matters
of
this
court
was
on
the
commission
side.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
will
you
not
get
a
certain
amount
of
hauling
in
here
if
the
district
captain
did
not
process
the
complaint
in
45
days?
i
mean
there
are
certainly
directives
in
judge
fullam’s
order
that
would
be
the
basis
for
contempt
citation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
court
ordered
–
they
did
not
volunteer
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
injunction
is
coercive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
class
actions
were
brought
under
section
1983,
principally
against
the
petitioners
who
are
the
mayor
and
police
commissioner
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
alleging
a
pervasive
pattern
of
unconstitutional
police
misconduct.
the
district
court,
after
lengthy
proceedings,
found
that
the
evidence
did
not
establish
the
existence
of
any
policy
on
the
part
of
petitioners
to
violate
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
respondent
classes
that
find
departmental
policy
to
minimize
the
consequences
of
police
misconduct
which
was
committed
by
a
small
percentage
of
policemen.
the
district
court
ordered
the
petitioners
to
submit
a
comprehensive
program,
jacketed
complete
provision
of
the
police
department’s
disciplinary
procedures.
the
petitioners,
the
city
officials
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
since
the
individual
respondents
have
not
demonstrated
a
real
and
immediate
threat
of
injury
at
the
hands
of
petitioners,
there
is
lacking
of
requisite
article
iii,
case
or
controversy,
as
to
them.
as
to
the
classes,
we
find
untenable
the
theories
of
liability
and
equitable
relief
adapted
by
the
lower
courts
under
section
1983
and
conclude
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
constitutes
an
unwarranted
intrusion
by
the
federal
judiciary
into
the
discretionary
authority
of
petitioners,
acting
as
officials
understate
in
local
law.
in
fashioning
prophylactic
procedures
designed
to
minimize
misconduct
by
a
relatively
huge
state
employees,
the
district
court
is
not
properly
heeded
important
principles
of
federalism.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
descending
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
join.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration,
or
decision
of
the
case.
