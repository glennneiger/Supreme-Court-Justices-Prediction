justice

in
your
second
point,
the
absence
of
a
fair
opportunity
to
rebut
the
presumption
based
on
the
facts
of
this
case
or
is
it
a
challenge
to
the
procedure
prescribed
by
regulations?
in
other
word,
are
we
talking
here
about
validity
of
a
statute
or
a
regulation
or
the
maladministration
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
these
particular
claimants?

you
a
question?

procedure
of
due

appellee's
brief

some
broad
categorical
statements,
i
will
read
one
to
you,
plaintiffs
were
not
afforded
a
hearing
of
any
kind
at
the
local
agency.
another
point
plaintiffs
were
afforded
any
opportunity
to
rebut
the
statutory
presumption
at
the
time
they
applied
for
assistance.

putting
maladministration
aside,

for
us
what
the
procedure
is?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
take
an
applicant
who
appears
for
the
time,
describe
the
procedure,
what
opportunity
does
he
have?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.

any
regulations
prescribe
the
procedure
at
this
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
just
tell
me,
what
they
are
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.

can
check
them
out?

any
pamphlets
or
written
information

--
one
other
question
the
three-judge
court
did
not
reach
the
procedure
of
due
process
issue,
it
is
addressed
by
the
both
of
you
on
the
briefs
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
we
should
reach
that
point
that
we
just
thought
that
we
should
remanded
the
three-judge
court
or
try
decide
it
on
this
record?
