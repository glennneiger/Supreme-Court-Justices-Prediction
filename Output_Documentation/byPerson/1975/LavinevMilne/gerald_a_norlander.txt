mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
record
shows
that
21
needy
persons
were
sanctioned
due
to
the
operation
of
the
statutory
presumption.
my
adversary
contends
in
her
reply
brief
now
that
20
out
of
those
21
persons
did
not
actually
terminate
their
employment
and
i
will
turn
that
question
a
little
later,
since
my
adversary
does
concede
at
page
5
of
the
reply
brief
that
the
presumption
was
properly
applied
in
the
case
of
plaintiff
beverly.
i
shall
turn
first
to
the
question
of
the
rationality
of
the
presumption
used
against
him.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
that
question,
your
honor,
i
believe
would
raise
a
serious
problem
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
think
it
would
be
a
close
question.
i
would
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
your
honor,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
benefit
that
has
impact
of
being
--
it
is
the
last
resort
for
a
person
who
is
destitute.
now,
whether
the
creation
of
a
class
of
persons
that
is
totally
destitute,
and
the
rejection
of
their
request
for
assistance
would
create
a
class
of
persons
with
no
legitimate
means
of
survival,
is
a
fact
question
that
would
have
to
arise
under
the
statute,
under
such
a
statute.
i
think
that
is
probably
what
would
happen
if
such
a
statute
were
written
in
new
york.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
as--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
this
court
has
never
held
that
welfare
is
a
constitutionally
required
benefit,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
has
never
held
at
one
state
offers
a
benefit,
it
may
have
arbitrarily
withdraw
or
deny
that
benefit.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
i
do
not
see
what
rational
purpose
of
that
would
advance.
i
think
it
is
a
close
question.
the
rational
basis
test
would
obviously
apply
to
the
situation.
i
think
it
is
that
one
would
probably,
one
might
even
concede
that
it
would
be
might
be
rational
on
its
face.
it
might
have
--
perhaps
the
legislature
could
imagine
a
person
who
wanted
to
be
on
welfare,
would
be
encouraged
to
save
his
money
for
75
days,
so
he
can
survive
before
that
time
and
then
he
could
receive
the
benefits
and
the
legislature
might
conceive
that
that
would
rationally
be
advanced
and
encouraged
by
such
a
rule,
but
in
operation,
i
am
afraid
that
under
such
a
statute,
i
think
experience
at
least
in
the
new
york
state
would
show
that
such
persons
who
would
be
rejected,
would
be
left,
but
virtually
no
legitimate
means
of
survival.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
a
class
of
persons
would
be
informed
as
a
result
of
the
operation
on
that
statute
and
it
is
rather
hypothetical
at
this
point.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
class
would
exist.
it
would
depend
upon
the
record
in
the
case.
i
doubt
that
the
creation
of
such
a
class
of
persons
would
rationally
advance
either
the
direct
purposes
of
new
york
social
services
law
or
the
purposes
of
that
statute.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
i
would
say
that
in
operation,
the
question
would
probably
boil
down
to
a
question
as
to
whether
such
as
classification
as
applied,
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
might
be
valid
on
its
face,
but
i
do
not
see
that
that
question
is
before
the
court.
most
of
my
adversary's
arguments
tend
to
relate
to
the
justification
of
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute
and
we
contend
that
the
validity
of
the
presumption
is
not
measured
by
the
validity
of
the
substantive
rule.
the
question
before
the
court
is
really
whether
the
state
has
adopted
a
fair
or
a
rational
means
of
determining
who
is
to
be
sanctioned
and
who
is
not
to
be
sanctioned,
who
shall
receive
assistance
and
who
shall
be
sanction
and
who
shall
have
75
days
where
the
benefit
is
forfeited.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
i
think
the
record
is
quiet
clear
in
this
respect,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
at
a
very
practical
level,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
label
of
the
sanction,
but
we
are
dealing
with
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
no.
i
think
that
the
record
shows
that
in
the
case
of
milne,
the
record
at
appendix
page
29,
westbrook
at
page
242,
brownly
at
304,
reed
at
291,
all
of
these
cases,
they
were
sanctioned
and
the
workers
i
believe,
by
the
use
of
that,
common
use
of
that
word
realize
that
they
were
in
the
business
of
punishing
these
persons
for
doing
something
that
they
had
done
wrong.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
we
do
not
concede
that
and
in
fact
they
have
taken
a
reversal
possession
in
their
papers
before
the
court
on
that
question.
let
me
point
out
that,
in
the
main
brief,
my
adversary
says
that
milne
at
page
10,
“was
denied
assistance
by
the
westchester
county
department
of
social
services
on
the
basis
of
new
york
social
services
on
13111
on
november
16,”
the
day
he
applied
and
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
9
virtually
the
same
statements
is
made
by
my
adversary.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
the
maladministration
of
the
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
one
of
the
questions
presented
by
my
adversary
in
jurisdictional
statement
is
whether
plaintiffs
had
a
share
opportunity
to
rebut
it.
we
contend
that
the
record
shows
not
maladministration,
but
the
lack
of
a
fair
opportunity
to
rebut
the
presumption.
the
particular
vice
of
an
arbitrary
presumption
is
that
innocent
persons
who
no
one
applying
commonsense
and
experience
to
the
facts
to
their
case
would
ever
sanction
or
impose
liability
upon
them.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
that
is
right!
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
oh!
yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
mr.
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
the
answer
is
sometimes
yes,
if
the
statute
as
applied
is
applied
in
unconstitutional
or
arbitrary
manner
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
the
district
court
judgment
that
held
at
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
although,
at
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
that
is
before
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
and
plaintiffs
have
urged
all
along
through
this
case.
in
their
motion
for
summary
judgment,
it
was
explicitly
mentioned
that
we
moved
to
have
the
presumption
declared
unconstitutional
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
the
critical
claim
in
the
application
of
the
presumption
is
that
plaintiffs
were
denied
the
fair
opportunity
to
rebut
the
presumption
because
they
were
denied
an
effective
opportunity
to
have
the
hearing,
which
was
delayed,
and
my
adversary
raises
that
question,
specifically
in
question
two
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
where
she
asks
this
court
to
determine
whether
plaintiffs
were
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
rebut
the
presumption.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
the
facts
and
the
records
illustrate
the
problem,
but,
our
contention
is
that
the
applicable
regulations
and
laws
are
not
really
in
dispute.
and,
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
no
law
and
regulation
requiring
the
defendant
to
notify
people
even
of
the
existence
of
the
presumption
nor,
obviously
are
people
advised
how
to
rebut
it,
or
what
kind
of
evidence
rebuts
it
and
in
the
hearings,
the
only
hearings
that
they
are
offered
by
regulation,
by
statute
are
need
not
to
be
decided
again
by
regulation,
until
up
to
90
days.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
i
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
in
the
beverly
case.
obviously,
every
applicant
has
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
some
information.
he
fills
out
the
application
form.
he
has
the
obligation
to
answer
any
question
that
is
asked
about
that.
he
has
the
obligation
to
produce
verifications.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well
obviously,
he
will
be
asked
why
he
left
his
employment.
if
he
says,
i
left
in
order
to
be
qualify
for
public
assistance,
i
assume
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
presumption.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
record
of
the
beverly
case
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
volunteer
--
of
recent
employment
termination
was
given
sufficient
prohibitive
weight
to
carry
the
presumed
fact
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
today.
it
is
not
because
plaintiffs
are
being
asked
about
why
they
quit
work.
in
fact,
the
post
judgment
instructions
issued
by
the
defendant,
they
appear
at
the
very
last
page
of
my
brief,
on
page
1
(c)
actually,
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
merely
the
implementing
instructions,
now
enforced
as
i
understand
it,
directly
to
case
worker
that
they
are
not
to
deny
assistance
unless
you
find
“from
all
available
evidence
as
a
fact
that
the
applicant
or
a
recipient
has
quit
his
or
her
employment
for
the
purposes
of
qualifying
for
public
assistance.”
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
framing
of
the
instructions
after
the
judgment,
there
was
a
colloquy
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
judge
wyatt,
indicated
that
that
was
the
court
meant
when
it
issued
the
injunction
that
from
now
on,
if
there
is
to
be
a
sanction
imposed,
it
should
be
based
upon
the
commonsense
and
experience
of
the
case
worker
and
it
should
not
use
this
rule
that
allows
them
to
issue
a
notice
you
quit
your
job,
come
back
and
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
no,
the
letter
was
drafted
by
the
department
of
social
services.
the
court
merely
enjoined
the
presumption.
it
did
not
issue
any
directive
to
the
agency
to
draft
this
letter.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
the
judgment
below
merely
says
that
the
presumption
may
not
be
enforced.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
that
is
right.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
that,
we
are
not
talking
merely
about
$
94.00
a
month
which
is
the
basic
grant
post
shelter
for
the
individuals
who
appeared
in
the
case
because,
obviously
if
there
is
mistake
in
the
denial
as
the
record
shows,
the
fair
hearing
process
corrected
the
number
of
those.
quite
effectively,
except
that
we
are
not
just
talking
about
$
94.00,
we
are
talking
about
what
the
use
of
that
means
to
the
plaintiffs
and
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
yes,
yes.
plaintiffs
contend
and
contrary
to
what
my
adversary
contends
that
the
rational
connection
test
announced
by
this
court
by
mobile
versus
turnipseed
does
require
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
the
court
said
in
mobile
that
there
must
be
a
rational
connection
between
the
given
facts
and
the
fact
presumed.
and
the
court
consistently
has
relied
upon
commonsense
and
common
experience
to
determine
whether
a
statutory
presumption
satisfied
the
requirements
to
due
process
and
irrational
connection
has
been
found
lacking
where
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
presumed
fact
more
likely
than
not
follows
from
the
given
facts.
the
question
thus
framed
for
this
case,
we
believe,
is
whether
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
plaintiffs
terminated
their
employment,
not
for
other
reasons,
but
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
for
public
assistance.
we
contend
that
commonsense
and
general
experience
teaches
that
people
ordinarily
did
not
terminate
their
employment
in
order
to
qualify
for
welfare
benefits,
that
rather
for
in
order
to
resolve
ordinary
on
the
job
conflicts,
health
problems,
transportation
problems,
any
number
of
other
problems
that
a
person
would
leave
his
employment
for.
the
defendant
himself
recognizes
these
ordinary
reasons
and
rules
in
the
regulations
and
rules
that
he
has
promulgated
in
which
he
tacitly
concedes
that
people
who
quit
work,
duty
owners,
conflicts
with
their
supervisors,
strikes,
discrimination,
people
who
leave
in
expectation
of
finding
another
job,
but
do
not
find
it,
he
concedes
that
those
are
not
persons
who
do
that
and
not
properly
subject
to
the
sanction.
we
contend
that
those
reasons
demonstrate
the
irrationality
of
the
presumption.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
yes,
he
is.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
certainly.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
the
presumption
allows
the
worker
to
really
cease
the
inquiry
at
the
time
when
it
is
found
that
a
person
recently
terminated
employment.
the
fact
that
recent
employment
termination
is
given
sufficient
weight
to
our
presumption
of
the
given
of
the
presumed
fact
and
as,
i
think
the
record
demonstrates
the
accuracy
of
making
these
subjective
determinations
by
welfare
case
workers
is
less
than
satisfactory
and
it
is
the,
the
element
of
error
is
very,
very
high
in
this
case.
i
would
point
out
that
if
one
would
review
the
notices
given
to
most
of
the
plaintiffs
we
could
see
that
the
75-day
period
was
generally
calculated
as
well
as
the
most
people
calculate
periods
of
time,
but
the
20
out
21
instances
the
defendant
concedes
the
subjective
purpose
was
erroneously
determined.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
i
do
not
know
that
the
presumption
would
be
needed
to
be
able
to
reject
that
claim.
if
a
person
refuses
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
my
adversary
did
say
in
oral
argument
below
that
presumption
is
necessary
because
we
do
not
have
to
take
a
person's
say
so
and
i
suppose
that
the
presumption
operates
to
provide,
the
given
presumed
fact
merely
upon
the
fact
that
the
person
voluntary
terminated
and
the
case
worker
is
free
to
totally
disregard
the
denial
under
the
presumption.
my
adversary
contends
in
her
main
brief
at
page
19
that
plaintiffs
milne,
lee
(ph),
strider
(ph)
and
beverly
(ph)
engaged
in
unusual
or
suspicious
behavior
when
they
terminated
their
employment
and
requested
assistance
thereafter.
i
would
also
contend
that
what
my
adversary
is
going
to
use
the
illustrations
milne,
lee,
strider
and
beverly
in
support
of
rationality
that
the
presumption
she
tacitly
concedes
that
they
voluntarily
quit
and
presumption
should
apply
to
them.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
the
facts
merely
illustrate
i
think,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
facial
issue,
they
merely
illustrate
the
irrationally
of
presumption.
it
is
not
and
you
are
quite
right,
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
facial
claim
are
illustrations
of
what
happens.
illustrations
of
the
common
reasons
why
people
will
leave
the
job
and
how
they
may
not
be
able
to
find
a
new
job,
how
their
claim
for
un-employment
insurance
benefits
maybe
erroneously
denied.
the
facts
show
that
the
persons
with
health
problems
very
often
terminate
employment
and
wind
up
applying
for
a
home
relief.
and
in
fact
the
study
showed
that
is
number
one
reason
why.
in
evaluating
the
rationality
of
the
presumption,
however,
the
court
has
always
looked
to
the
facts
in
the
record
and
the
court
has
looked
to
the
facts
in
the
case
and
in
the
history
of
the
similar
presumptions
and
the
court
has
looked
to
legislative
records
and
to
other
sources
of
information
to
ascertain
whether
common
experience
and
commonsense,
present
day
experience
support
the
presumption.
so,
in
that
limited
sense
the
facts
in
the
record
are
relevant
to
the
2.1
in
our
brief.
the
record
does
show
in
fact
that
most
plaintiffs
first
saw
other
work.
in
fact,
beverly
found
the
job
as
janitor
for
a
week.
plaintiff
milne
had
a
record
of
17
years
of
continuous
employment
and
this
illustrates
that
the
presumption
was
neither
easy
to
rebut
nor
rational.
not
only
is
it
contrary
to
commonsense
that
people
would
leave
their
jobs
in
order
to
qualify
for
welfare
benefits,
but
looking
at
the
nature
of
the
home
relief
program
in
new
york
in
its
totality,
there
is
simply
nothing
in
that
program
that
would
cause
us
to
depart
from
the
commonsense
approach
to
the
presumption.
the
entire
home
relief
program
is
based
upon
the
concept
of
less
eligibility
and
that
means
that
generally
speaking,
the
program
will
be
less
desirable
than
working
for
a
living.
for
instance
as
a
precondition
for
receiving
any
benefits
a
person
first
register
for
any
available
work
and
even
if
there
is
unemployment
in
the
local
economy,
he
maybe
assigned
to
perform
full
time
work
at
a
public
works
project
or
work
relief
program
for
no
extra
pay.
also
the
home
relief
program
has
a
stringent
means
test
and
the
applicant
must
generally
have
depleted
all
of
his
savings,
his
assets.
he
maybe
disqualified
for
owning
an
automobile.
if
he
owns
has
equity
in
a
home,
he
will
have
to
assign
it
to
the
department
of
social
services.
all
of
these
factors
make
it
very
undesirable
for
a
person
to
give
up
personal
possessions
in
order
to
qualify
for
public
assistance.
finally
the
benefits
themselves
which
are
rent
allowance
plus
$94.00
a
month
or
about
$3.10
a
day
are
simply
not
the
sort
of
benefit
that
would
cause
a
person
to
ordinary
leave
his
employment
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
for
it.
indeed,
the
benefits
themselves
are
set
at
the
scale
to
provide
only
for
the
bare
necessities
of
life.
when
one
looks
at
the
entire
picture
of
the
home
relief
program,
the
means
test,
the
amount
of
benefits,
the
work
rules
and
the
other
factors,
that
intangible
factors
perhaps
the
stigma,
all
of
these
factors
when
they
are
combined
with
the
ordinary
reasons
for
terminated
employment
merely
re-affirm
that
what
commonsense
tells
us,
that
people
just
would
not
to
quit
work
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
benefit.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
presumption
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
legislative
record
to
support
it.
my
adversary
contends
at
page
10
of
the
reply
brief
that
there
is
no
evidence
available
on
the
behavior
of
plaintiff
class.
plaintiffs
submit
that
common
experience
and
general
experience
is
to
the
contrary
and
that
the
available
interpretable
data
actually
show
the
best
available
information
show
that
poor
people
and
welfare
recipients
have
the
same
kind
of
attitude
towards
work
and
welfare
as
other
people.
this
is
what
the
president's
commission
on
income
maintenance
programs
found
in
1969
in
it
is
report.
in
the
president’s
commission
report
they
said
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
work
attitudes
of
poor
people
and
i
quote
“our
observation
have
convinced
us
that
poor
are
not
unlike
the
non
poor.
most
to
the
poor
want
to
work.
they
want
improve
their
potential
and
to
be
trained
for
better
jobs.
like
most
americans,
the
poor
would
like
to
do
more.”
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
--
and
the
likes.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
that
--
my
adversary
contends
that
there
is
no
evidence
available
with
respect
to
that
group
and
so
the
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well,
the
position
of
the
president's
commission
has
been
tested
by
a
massive
study
in
new
jersey
in
which
the
united
states
office
of
the
economic
opportunity
spent
$8
million
over
a
three-year
period
to
test
the
precise
question
whether
people
would
quit
their
jobs
in
order
to
qualify
for
welfare
benefits.
basically
there
are
two
ways
to
determine,
i
guess,
whether
people
would
quit
work
to
qualify
for
benefits.
one
would
be
to
offer
them
a
generous
benefit
without
a
work
rule
which
is
what
that
experiment
did
and
the
other
way
is
to
look
at
people
who
apply
for
welfare
and
find
out
why
they
are
applying.
alright,
both
ends
are
those
--
of
those
experiences
we
see
that
people
have
not
quit
work
in
order
to
qualify
for
welfare
benefits
and
interviews
of
people
who
do
a
apply
for
welfare
benefits
and
exhaustive
studies
for
the
reasons
why
people
apply
for
welfare
benefits
all
come
up
with
commonsense
reasons
that
people
apply
for
welfare
benefits
because
they
could
not
find
a
new
job,
because
they
were
not
covered
by
unemployment.
the
number
one
reason
in
new
york
is
health
reasons.
these
kinds
of
reasons
are
quite
independent
of
any
desire
or
motive
to
actually
qualify
for
the
benefits.
also
the
experience
under
the
work
programs
have
found
that
most
of
people
who
are
asked
to
go
out
and
work
actually
are
complying
with
the
rules
and
so
we
really
submit
that
the
available
information
when
there
is
nothing
to
support
the
presumption
and
does
confirm
what
common
sense
and
common
experience
tell
us
that
presumption
is
irrational.
plaintiffs
also
contend
that
this
presumption
is
an
unfair
rule
to
impose
against
the
plaintiffs.
in
goldberg
against
kelly,
the
court
stressed
that
fact
finding
procedures
should
be
flexible
and
they
should
be
geared
to
the
capacities
of
the
parties.
we
have
here
a
class
of
persons
who
are
not
highly
educated
and
who
are
not
high
income
persons,
they
are
unlikely
to
be
represented
and
they
are
unlikely
to
understand
a
sophisticated
rule
of
procedure
like
presumption
that
was
invoked
against
them.
that
the
defendant
has
shown
absolutely
no
legitimate
justification
for
the
practical
use
of
this
presumption
and
in
fact
the
defendants
accepted
if
deputy
commissioner
swore
in
the
court
below
and
i
quote
from
page
452
of
the
appendix
of
the
bottom
page,
the
very
last
sentence,
executive
deputy,
mahler
swore,
“it
also
clear
that
determinations
are
based
on
of
evidence
and
not
an
presumption
or
legal
conclusions.”
and
my
adversary
concedes
at
the
top
of
page
18
of
her
reply
brief
that
it
would
be
possible
to
make
the
determination
without
the
presumption.
the
record
shows
that
the
presumption
allows
the
exercise
of
our
obituary
power
by
case
workers.
i
do
not
think
that
any
other
conclusion
can
be
reached
to
reviewing
this
record
and
the
state
concedes
as
much
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
these
instances
where
erroneous
determination
and
adjectives
are
used
that
the
presumption
is
repugnant,
that
used
the
presumption
was
repugnant
of
the
statute,
i
assume
she
means
the
first
sentence
of
the
statute.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
well.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
i
would
not
agree.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that
the
fundamental
concept
of
the
rebutted
--
of
the
rational
connection
test
is
that
it
prevents
sweeping
in
of
a
broad
class
of
persons
and
subjecting
them
to
the
liability
imposed
by
the
first
--
by
the
substantive
rule
and
i
think
record
demonstrates
that.
thank
you.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
correct,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
i
think
not,
your
honor
because
if
we
have
a
situation
quite
unlike
that
in
the
case
of
weinberger
against
salfi
decided
in
last
term.
in
that
case
it
is
true
that
the
presumption
there
amounted
to
a
substantive
rule
of
law,
but
in
this
case
the
statute
does
not
purport
to
do
that.
the
statute
purports
to
make
an
individual
finding
of
fraud.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
we
say
it
has
that
the
same
rice.
we
say
that
it
is,
that
however
it
falls
under
the
rules
of
rebuttable
presumption,
we
by
analogy
we
argue
--
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
yes.
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander
thank
you.
