only
the
validity
of
the
presumptions,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
not
of
the
substantive
law
that
this
allows
home
relief
for
somebody
who
has
quit
his
job
for
the
purpose
of
going
on
home
relief?
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
75
days,
not
the
substantive
law,
that
is
not
an
issue
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
it
not
the
--
i
maybe
a
little
obtuse,
but
as
you
go
on
in
the
argument,
maybe
you
can
clarify
it
for
me.
i
thought
the
other
of
the
claim
is
that
as
a
practical
manner
invalidating
this
presumption
is
not
very
important,
so
long
as
the
substantive
law
remains
in
effect,
if
the
applicant
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
any
event?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
gathered
from
reading
the
briefs
and
if
that
is
so,
then
the
invalidation
of
the
presumption
does
not
hurt
the
stateâ€™s
position
very
much,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
with
law?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
substantive
law
remains
wholly
valid
that
a
person
is
not
eligible
for
home
relief,
if
for
the
first
75
days
after
the
termination
of
his
employment,
if
he
has
terminated
his
employment
for
the
purpose
of
going
on
home
relief,
he
has
to
prove
his
eligibility,
he
has
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
that
remains
true
under
this
court's
decision
whether
or
not
it
is
going
through
the
motions
of
invalidating
this
statutory
presumption?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
that
is
true
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
potter
stewart
but
an
applicant
for
home
relief
still
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
eligibility,
does
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
not
that
correct
as
matter
of
new
york
law?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
it
is
a
matter
general
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
applicant
for
anything
has
to
prove
his
eligibility
for
what
he
wants?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
--
just
one
more
try
one
more
time
and
then
just
i
will
to
try
stop
bothering
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
then
in
the
course
of
your
argument
maybe
you
can
explain
it.
had
there
never
been
this
presumption
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
would
not
have
--
the
applicant
would
have
still
had
the
burden
of
proving
his
eligibility?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
fact,
the
law
generally
would
have
been
as
though
this
presumption
were
written
into
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
had
they
never
been
any
statutory
presumption?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
never
been
this
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
the
applicant
still
has
to
prove
his
eligibility?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
particular
case,
the
plaintiffs
do
not
seem
to
have
to
quit
their
jobs,
they
seem
to
have
been
fired?
justice
potter
stewart
did
not
know?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
were
victims
of
maladministration
by
the
state
and
they
probably
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
victims
of
unfair
administration
of
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
supposed
to
be
eligible
for
home
relief
and
it
not
is
not
a
matter
of
the
sanction?
justice
potter
stewart
eligibility?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
your
sisters
on
the
other
side,
they
conceive
the
maladministration
of
this
law?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
fairest
and
the
most
valid
law
regulation
in
the
world
you
can
have
the
maladministration
by
ignorant
or
abusive
--
justice
potter
stewart
administrator,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you.
you
can
answer
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gerald
a.
norlander,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
in
your
brief
at
least,
i
think
you
made
it
again
today
that
you
say
that
while
in
terms
this
is
a
rebuttable
presumption,
impractical
fact,
it
is
irrebuttable
presumption
because
by
time
the
fair
hearing
is
held
the
75-day
has
passed.
justice
potter
stewart
now
if
that
is
true
and
if
we
except
the
wigmore
theory
that
an
irrebuttable
presumption
is
not
a
presumption
at
all,
but
merely
a
substantive
rule
of
law,
then
are
we
not
faced
with
my
brother
rehnquist's
question
of
earlier
in
this
argument
with
i.e.
the
substantive
validity
of
a
law
that
says
that
anybody
who
voluntarily
terminates
his
employment
shall
be
ineligible
for
home
relief
for
75
days,
cannot
rewrite
up
against
that,
if
this
is
an
rebuttable
presumption?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
tell
us
in
fact
it
is
tantamount
to
any
rebuttable
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
want
to
have
it
both
ways?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
