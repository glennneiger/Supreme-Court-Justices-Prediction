if
mr.
justice
stewart
is
correct
that
it
would
not
make
any
difference
whether
the
presumption
is
in
or
out
of
the
case
then
there
is
hardly
any
case
of
controversy
about
that
statute
and
the
district
court
should
never
adjudicated
it
and
much
of
that,
you
would
vacate
and
dismiss
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
not
really
care
about
that,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
the
judgment
of
unconstitutionality
would
be
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
like
the
20
out
of
the
21
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
under
new
york
law
if
there
is
a
hearing
at
sometime,
maybe
90
days,
maybe
whatever
it
is,
if
the
applicant
win,
i
take
it
he
does
to
get
the
back
pay,
so
to
speak,
back
to
the
time
when
he
should
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i
just
asked
whether
that
they
did
get
back
pay
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
an
applicant
were
asked
whether
he
quit
work
to
receive
relief
and
the
applicant
answered
no,
that
is
all
he
was
doing,
and
he
did
not
offer
any
other
reason,
and
there
was
no
other
inquiry
would
the
presumption
serve
to
reject
his
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
just
says,
he
says
no,
i
did
not
quit
at
work
to
get
a
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
lavine
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
here
under
a
new
york
welfare
statute,
a
person
is
disqualified
for
75
days
from
receiving
home
relief,
if
he
quits
his
job
in
order
to
go
on
relief.
the
statute
also
presumes
that
he
has
left
his
job
for
this
purpose,
if
he
applies
for
welfare
within
that
75-day
period.
the
three-judge
court
though
this
seeming
resumption
was
violative
the
due
process
of
law
and
entered
a
judgment
to
this
effect.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
in
our
view
this
so
called
resumption
there
is
no
more
than
to
place
the
burden
on
the
applicant
to
prove
his
qualification
in
this
respect
just
like
he
must
prove
his
other
qualifications
and
we
hence
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
considerations
or
decision
of
this
case.
