ms.
amy
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
presents
the
issue
whether
legislatively
created
rebuttable
presumptions
in
civil
cases
will
continue
to
be
hospitably
treated
by
the
courts
as
long
as
there
is
some
rational
connection
between
the
facts
proven
and
the
facts
presumed.
appellant,
the
commissioner
of
social
services
of
the
state
of
new
york
appeals
to
preserve
his
position
that
this
established
standard
is
the
appropriate
measure
for
judging
rebuttable
presumptions
in
these
cases.
it
also
his
position
that
the
statute,
the
presumption
in
section
131-11
of
new
york
social
services
law
which
was
declared
invalid
on
its
face
by
a
three-judge
district
court
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
in
fact
valid
under
the
established
standard.
the
presumption
is
contained
in
a
statute
governing
eligibility
for
public
assistance
in
new
york
state.
the
statute
provides
that
a
person
who
voluntarily
terminates
his
employment
or
reduces
his
earning
capacity
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance
or
increasing
his
grant
is
ineligible
for
public
assistance
for
a
period
of
75
days.
the
presumption
which
was
declared
invalid
below
is
an
evidentiary
rule
for
determining
whether
the
purpose
of
the
person
in
quitting
his
job
was
to
obtain
public
assistance.
that
presumption
is
triggered
only
when
the
person
voluntarily
terminates
his
job
and
when
he
applies
for
public
assistance
within
75
days,
then
and
only
then
is
he
presumed
to
have
terminated
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance.
the
statute
applies
to
applicants
for
aftc
as
well
as
to
the
state
created
home
relief
program.
however,
no
plaintiff
was
an
applicant
for
aftc
and
the
specific
statutory
and
regulatory
provisions
apply
differently
in
the
cases
of
aftc
applicants.
both
parties
now
agree
that
the
court
below
erred
in
extending
its
order
to
include
aftc
applicants
and
question
number
three
is
no
longer
an
issue
between
the
parties.
therefore,
we
will
address
ourselves
solely
to
the
application
of
this
presumption
to
applicants
for
the
state
aid
at
home
relief
program.
home
relief
is
the
assistance
provided
by
new
york
state
to
persons
who
are
not
eligible
for
federal
categorical
assistance.
that
this
persons
who
congress
has
not
deemed
to
be
the
most
needy
people
and
because
it
is
totally
supported
by
the
public
moneys
from
the
treasuries
of
the
state
and
local
governments
in
new
york,
the
terminations
of
eligibility
are
totally
governed
by
state
law
and
the
issue
presented
in
this
court
is
only
the
validity
of
that
state
law
under
the
constitution.
ms.
amy
juviler
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
amy
juviler
that
is
correct.
ms.
amy
juviler
well,
that
is
the
precise
form
of
the
order,
is
to
declare
the
presumption
invalid,
but
as
a
practical
matter
it
precludes
this
very
sensitively
drafted
statute
from
having
a
practical
fit.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
your
honor,
one
of
the
things
that
we
find
amazing
about
this
case
is
that
the
court
below
found
this
presumption
to
violate
the
plaintiff
class'
constitutional
rights
because
if
one
reads
the
statute
which
clearly
says
that
he
has
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
proving
each
element
of
eligibility
--
ms.
amy
juviler
--
in
any
event,
the
presumption
merely
clarifies
and
makes
explicit
his
duty
to
do
so
and
promotes
uniformity
of
application
throughout
the
state.
it
does
not
add
any
burdensome
procedural
impediment
to
his
obtaining
public
assistance.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
it
does.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
ms.
amy
juviler
the
major
reason
that
it
does
is
that
it
is
an
injunction.
the
appellant,
the
commissioner
of
social
services
and
his
agents
in
the
local
departments
are
now
enjoined
from
enforcing
this
presumption,
which
means
that
they
are
enjoined
from
requiring
a
person
to
come
forward
and
produce
evidence
of
why
he
terminated
his
employment.
ms.
amy
juviler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
juviler
except
--
ms.
amy
juviler
the
difference
that
it
makes
is
as
follows.
there
is
an
injunction
against
appellant
from
specifically
requiring
a
person
to
produce
evidence
of
the
purpose.
therefore,
while
there
is
a
general
duty
to
produce
each
element
of
evidence
to
prove
each
element
of
eligibility,
the
eligibility
under
131-11,
that
is
the
purpose
for
which
you
terminated
your
employment,
cannot
be
produced
or
at
least
there
is
a
considerable
cloud
on
a
local
agent
who
required
the
production
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
other
who
made
a
determination
unfavorable
to
the
applicant
when
the
record
was
silent
as
to
his
purpose.
that
is
the
effect
of
the
presumption.
now,
while
we
agree
with
the
court
that
the
presumption
did
not
add
to
the
procedural
burdens.
when
a
court
invalidates
the
statute
and
enjoins
a
party
he
is
put
at
his
peril
to
continue
to
operate
the
underlying
statute
in
which
he
could
impose
that
duty
because
he
is
subject
to
contempt.
i
want
to
note
that
there
is
already
been
an
effort
to
find
appellant
in
contempt
in
this
case.
ms.
amy
juviler
i
believe
that
that
will
be
up
to
this
court
and
it
is
--
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
except
the
injunction
in
this
case
raises
very
considerable
doubt.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes
i
think
it
makes
it
effective
because
of
the
nature
of
this
very
sensitive
statute.
since
the
statute
is
only
invoked
when
the
person
has
terminated
his
employment
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance,
the
next
question
for
the
legislature
is
how
we
measure
a
person’s
purpose
and
since
it
is
always
matters
that
are
totally
within
his
control,
they
place
the
burden
explicitly
on
the
applicant
to
produce
credible
evidence
of
his
purpose,
that
his
purpose
was
not
to
obtain
public
assistance
when
he
quit
his
employment.
and
without
the
presumption
whether
the
presumption
as
explicitly
written
and
clarified
under
the
legislative
program
or
the
general
rules
of
law
which
would
enable
the
local
administrator
to
enforce
such
a
presumption
without
the
ability
of
the
local
administrator
to
put
the
specific
burden
of
proof
on
the
applicant
this
statute
is
unworkable.
ms.
amy
juviler
right.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes.
ms.
amy
juviler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
local
agency
could
have
required
him
to
produce
the
evidence.
ms.
amy
juviler
the
only
--
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
that
is
--
ms.
amy
juviler
that
is
our
position
that
he
still
could
be
required
to.
the
only
difference
the
presumption
made
and
it
is
a
subtle
difference
and
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
constitutional
import,
that
is
the
whole
weight
of
our
argument
that
the
court
below
had
no
grounds,
whatever
to
find
this
presumption
violated
anybody’s
constitutional
right.
but
the
only
difference
the
presumption
made
was
that
it
clarified
the
specific
duty
and
it
promoted
uniformity
throughout
the
districts
and
considering
the
complicated
administrative
scheme
we
are
talking
about,
that
is
not
an
insignificant
matter.
ms.
amy
juviler
there
certainly
is
no
reason,
your
honor.
our
near
neighbor
new
jersey,
does
have
that
requirement.
they
say
that
any
applicant
for
aid
for
the
families
of
the
working
poor
are
ineligible
for
assistance
after
voluntary
termination
for
90
days.
furthermore,
in
the
federal
aftc
program
for
unemployed
fathers,
the
entire
family
is
ineligible
for
assistance
for
30
days,
irrespective
of
whether
the
person
voluntarily
terminated
or
whether
he
was
fired,
as
long
as
after
termination
of
employment
he
was
ineligible
for
30
days,
so
that
there
are
parallel
statutory
schemes,
to
say
nothing
of
numerous
parallel
regulatory
schemes
which
provide
just
that.
ms.
amy
juviler
that
is
correct
and
indeed,
i
think
that
anyone
looking
at
this
statutory
schemes
sees
the
very
narrow
road
that
our
legislature
travels.
they
could
have
done
what
arizona
and
delaware
did
and
said
that
no
employable
person
is
eligible
for
the
state
general
assistance
or
they
could
have
done
what
new
jersey
and
the
federal
government
did
and
say
that
nobody
is
eligible
after
voluntary
termination
of
employment
or
they
could
have
said
nobody
is
eligible
after
voluntary
termination
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance
and
they
did
not
do
any
of
those
things.
they
said
a
person
is
eligible
who
voluntarily
terminates
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance
after
75
days.
so
that
this
is
very,
very
permissive
statute
and
that
is
why
the
essential
of
the
evidentiary
rule
that
is
present
here
is
so
important
because
it
is
the
only
thing
that
allows
this
permissive
statute
to
have
any
practical
effect.
because
if
you
switched
the
burden
and
impose
the
burden
on
the
state
department
and
the
local
agencies
to
prove
purpose,
you
would
have
completely
shackled
them
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
appellees
do
suggest
that
the
state
agency
and
local
departments
have
an
easier
time,
proving
the
purpose
with
which
the
applicant
left
his
employment.
i
think
that
it
is
plain
that
the
applicant,
no
matter
how
uneducated
and
how
poor
he
maybe,
is
in
a
better
position
to
tell
the
agency
why
he
quit
his
job
and
the
agency
with
all
the
learning
in
world
is
able
to
tell
him
why
he
quit
his
job.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
problem
in
this
case
was
not
whether
the
plaintiffs
had
a
complaint.
i
think
there
are
two
problems
in
this
case
were
not
really
at
issue.
it
is
clear
that
the
named
plaintiffs,
except
for
joseph
beverly,
had
a
very
serious
complaint
and
it
is
also
clear
that
the
statute
of
which
they
were
complaining
was
obviously
valid
by
all
of
the
rules
of
procedural
and
substantive
due
process
that
have
ever
been
enunciated
by
any
court
who
seriously
gave
it
a
moment’s
thought
and
the
problem
that
this
case
created
was
a
terrible
mixed
up
of
these
two
things.
one,
the
plaintiffs
have
this
complaint
about
the
application
of
the
statute
and
the
court
probably
in
impatience
because
of
the
serious
misapplication
of
the
statue
decided
to
knock
out
the
presumption.
knocking
out
the
presumption
did
not
help
milne,
strider
(ph)
or
lee
(ph).
ms.
amy
juviler
because
the
presumption
was
not
applied
to
them.
they
were
fired
form
their
jobs.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes
and
we
point
--
ms.
amy
juviler
well,
we
do
not
even
concede
that
it
is
under
the
statute.
it
applies
so
much
in
the
face
of
the
statutes.
ms.
amy
juviler
administration
of
the
law
without
a
question
and
we
are
not
here
defending
that
maladministration.
ms.
amy
juviler
we
have
separated
ourselves
from
it
since
the
very
beginning.
indeed
the
local
commissioner
was
separately
represented
and
when
the
decision
below
came
down
in
which
the
presumption
was
invalidated
on
its
face
he
did
not
appeal
because
there
was
no
finding
against
him.
the
only
thing
that
really
we
are
here
defending
is
the
statute
which
really
did
not
cause
any
of
the
hardships
that
are
outlined
below
and
that
is
exactly
the
posture
of
this
case
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
want
to
point
out
why
that
presumption
is
inherently
rational.
ms.
amy
juviler
no,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
juviler
you
mean
about
this
presumption
particularly?
ms.
amy
juviler
if
we
talk
about
the
second
face,
yes
that
is
true,
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
not
the
presumption.
first
of
all
the
presumption
was
deemed
necessary
by
the
legislature.
it
may
seem
petty
at
the
stage
when
we
are
in
this
high
court
to
discuss
the
minute
service
that
it
performs
of
clarification
and
uniformity,
but
the
legislature
did
deem
it
necessary
and
did
formally
in
its
sovereign
power
enact
this
presumption.
therefore,
for
a
court
to
enjoin
it
and
declare
it
invalid,
there
has
to
be
something
unconstitutional
and
that
very
decision
itself
demands
reversal.
secondly,
the
presumption
as
the
face
in
the
statute
itself
may
not
be
essential,
but
the
idea
of
the
presumption
is
essential.
the
idea
that
the
person
can
be
forced
to
have
the
burden
of
proof,
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
in
the
presence
of
silence
on
that
subject,
he
can
be
deemed
to
have
terminated
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance.
those
are
the
three
functions
of
the
presumption
and
those
are
not
frivolous.
so
those
are
the
two
reasons
why
this
appeal
is
here.
i
understand,
your
honors,
impatience
with
such
an
innocuous
presumption
and
it
is
frankly
been
our
patience
from
the
beginning
of
the
case.
we
have
been
more
patient
maybe
we
would
not
be
here.
i
do
want
because
very
obviously
valid
presumption
was
declared
invalid.
i
do
not
want
to
miss
my
opportunity
to
explain
to
you
why
in
very
simple
terms
it
is
valid
and
that
is
that
the
relationship
between
the
facts
proven
of
voluntary
termination
and
the
early
application
for
public
assistance
why
they
have
an
internal
rationality
and
it
is
clear
that
income
from
employment
is
so
important
to
us
all;
rich,
middle
class,
poor
that
we
do
not
forgo
that
major
source
of
income
without
some
idea
of
where
our
next
source
of
income
will
come.
if
after
voluntarily
giving
up
that
one
major
source
of
income,
we
shortly
thereafter
appeal
and
apply
for
another
major
source
of
income,
it
is
rational
within
the
terms
of
the
constitutional
rule
to
assume
that
the
reason
that
we
gave
up
the
one
source
of
income
was
to
make
ourselves
eligible
for
the
second
source
of
income
as
long
as
we
have
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
this
was
not
the
case.
secondly,
there
is
a
tamper
relationship
between
these
two
actions
which
has
long
been
the
basis
of
many
rebuttable
presumptions
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
many
future
administrative
schemes,
it
is
important
that
this
device
is
not
the
clouded
by
a
decision
such
as
that
rendered
by
the
court
below.
therefore,
it
is
clear
that
this
rebuttable
presumption
allows
for
the
individualized
determinations
which
this
court
has
so
long
favored.
irrebuttable
presumptions
have
been
criticized
just
because
they
do
not
provide
that
kind
of
individualized
determinations
and
it
is
surprising
to
be
found
here,
having
to
defend
under
the
due
process
clause,
the
very
individualized
determinations
which
have
so
long
been
held
up
as
an
example.
the
appellees
also
claim
that
the
presumption
is
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
while
the
court
below
did
not
reach
that
question,
analysis
under
the
equal
protection
clause
only
makes
more
cogent
the
validity
of
this
presumption.
first
of
all
the
equal
protection
standard
is
the
same
standard
as
the
due
process
standard
of
rationality.
secondly,
if
we
look
at
the
classifications
in
the
statute,
we
see
how
reasonable
the
statute
is.
the
distinctions
are
between
people
who
quit
their
jobs
and
people
who
do
not
quit
their
jobs,
very
closely
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
deter
people
from
leaving
their
job
without
the
means
of
subsistence
in
the
near
future,
to
encourage
them
to
provide
for
themselves
in
the
near
future
and
to
limit
the
finite
resources
of
the
state
to
people
most
in
need.
and
the
second
classification
under
the
statute
is
the
difference
between
people
who
recently
quit
their
employment
and
became
eligible
for
public
assistance
and
those
who
not
so
recently
quit
their
job
to
become
eligible.
both
of
those
are
not
attackable
as
classifications,
which
could
in
any
conceivable
sense
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
do
want
to
point
that
the
procedures
for
dealing
with
the
presumptions
are
also
at
issue
here
in
a
limited
sense.
the
mobile
turnipseed
rule,
which
is
the
rule
of
rationality,
which
we
have
discussed,
is
a
two-fold
rule.
one,
it
requires
that
a
presumption
have
a
rational
relationship
between
the
facts
proven
and
the
facts
presumed
and
the
second
part
of
that
rule,
is
that
there
must
be
an
opportunity
to
rebut.
well,
the
court
below
did
not
find
that
there
was
not
enough
opportunity
to
rebut.
there
were
some
footnotes
which
made
some
suggestions
that
we
feel
were
unjustified
and
furthermore
to
demonstrate
the
clear
validity
of
this
presumption,
we
did
discuss
the
procedures
for
rebuttal
in
our
brief
and
they
were
framed
this
question
number
two.
however,
those
--
that
question
only
relates
to
the
statute
and
regulations
on
their
face
not
as
to
the
statute
in
regulation
as
applied
which
were
issues
of
fact,
debated
in
the
court
below
and
not
available
for
decision
on
summary
judgment.
in
general,
we
should
look
at
the
context
of
these
hearings
that
this
is
an
administrative
proceeding
for
an
application
for
state
created
benefits
and
that
the
procedure
before
the
social
services
department
is
informal
and
the
hearing
regulations,
the
regulations
regarding
that
informal
procedure,
make
it
clear
that
no
finding
of
an
eligibility
can
be
rendered
without
a
fair
opportunity
given
to
the
applicant
to
rebut
furthermore
that
decision
is
subject
to
supervisory
review
in
all
respects
it
meets
the
standards
of
tot
versus
new
york
state
labor
department
and
those
standards
are
stricter
than
are
necessary
in
this
case
which
is
an
application
proceeding.
furthermore,
there
is
a
fair
hearing
procedure
in
the
state
court
which
is
regulated
now
and
during
the
entire
dependency
of
this
suit
by
an
order
of
judge
motley
of
the
southern
district
court
and
in
case
in
which
applicants
all
were
members
of
the
class
protected,
nelson
versus
sugarman.
therefore,
we
regard
this
presumption
as
a
clearly
valid
exercise
of
the
legislature’s
prerogative
to
establish
evidentially
rules
and
as
such
we
request
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed
in
all
respects,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
i
just
have
two
things
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first,
is
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
regulations
that
existed
before
the
decision
of
the
court
below
which
did
make
explicit
the
way
the
facts
were
found.
they
appear
in
appendix,
but
they
also
appear
more
conveniently
at
our
brief
from
pages
45
through
47
and
those
are
regulations
with
regard
to
this
specific
statute
and
the
general
regulation
for
how
a
determination
of
eligibility
is
made
appear
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
at
pages
1(a)
and
following,
particularly
i
want
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
provisions
of
section
3518
then
18
nycrr,
appearing
at
pages
4(a)
and
5(a)
which
describes
how
determinations
of
eligibility
are
made
and
which
make
clear
that
there
could
be
no
determination
of
eligibility
unless
the
agent
found
that
the
applicant
did
not
produce
a
credible
evidence
to
overcome
the
presumption
and
further
more
the
agent
is
required
to
make
investigation
and
to
verify
all
conditions
of
eligibility.
with
regard
to
this
specific
statute,
the
pre-existing
regulations
gave
specific
examples
of
kinds
of
reasons
for
leaving
employment
which
would
overcome
the
presumptions,
such
as
illness,
the
payment
of
minimum
wages
and
so
forth
and
the
regulation
went
on
and
said
local
district
of
course
should
not
consider
this
list
as
exhausting
the
possibilities
under
which
a
voluntary
or
provoked
discharge
is
not
subject
to
sanction,
but
should
continue
to
exercise
reasonable
discretion
considering
such
factors
as
the
lapse
of
time
between
termination
of
employment
and
the
application
for
assistance
that
means
something
less
75
days,
if
the
difference
between
60
days
and
15
a
substantial.
and
also
in
attempt
to
resolve
the
differences
with
the
employer
which
led
to
the
termination,
ability
to
verify
reasons
alleged
for
termination
and
so
forth
as
reasons
--
as
judgments
as
to
whether
or
not
the
presumption
has
been
overcome.
so
the
regulations
were
specific
regarding
the
presumption
and
it
was
only
after
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
the
determination
had
to
made
without
regard
to
burden
of
proof.
i
know
that
all
of
us
have
discussed
this
experimental
data
which
is
bit
far
afield
exhaustively
for
the
court.
you
have
been
very
patient,
but
i
want
to
a
point
out
that
the
major
error
in
all
the
experimental
data
is
that
they
come
up
with
the
findings
that
most
people
would
not
quit
their
jobs
and
most
people
would
not
apply
for
public
assistance
and
even
if
that
is
so
when
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
we
are
dealing
here
only
with
people
who
did
quit
their
job
and
did
apply
for
public
assistance,
and
therefore,
all
of
that
material
is
irrelevant.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
amy
juviler
sure.
ms.
amy
juviler
at
the
time
--
from
initial
application?
ms.
amy
juviler
the
applicant
is
interviewed
and
it
is
interview
which
is
the
primary
and
original
source
of
information.
he
discusses
his
general
situation
and
it
comes
down
to
the
situation
that
he
is
a
home
relief
applicant.
he
is
not
a
caretaker
for
eligible
shelter
and
he
is
not
agent
for
blind
and
disabled,
and
they
say,
how
have
you
been,
this
is
specific
on
giving
specific
reference
to
351
(a),
how
have
you
been
maintaining
yourself
in
the
past
and
he
said
well,
a
week
ago
i
had
a
job,
let
us
talk
about
joseph
beverly
specifically
because
we
do
have
live
case.
joseph
beverly
said,
four
days
ago,
i
quit
my
job
working
on
a
chicken
farm
and
i
moved
down
here
to
geneva
and
they
say
to
him
well,
why
you
quit
a
job
and
he
says,
it
was
not
worth
it
for
me
to
continue
because
rent
is
so
expensive
and
i
was
evicted
because
i
could
not
pay
my
rent,
and
therefore,
i
left
my
job,
that
is
the
specific
statement.
now,
they
then
and
specifically
in
beverly
case,
which
is
our
last
case,
they
called
the
employer
and
indeed
at
the
ultimate
fair
hearing
which
occurred
only
two
weeks
after
this
initial
interview,
the
employer
did
testify
and
said,
i
continue,
i
still
want
to
hire
joseph
beverly
back,
he
was
a
fine
worker.
and
the
hearing
officer
determined
as
his
decision
specifically
state
that
he
did
not
believe
that
beverly
quit
his
job
because
he
could
not
find
housing.
he
believed
he
quit
his
job.
he
made
is
finding
a
fact,
an
actual
fact
that
he
quit
his
job
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance.
but
with
regard
to
somebody
who
might
overcome
the
presumption,
you
might
have
the
situation
like
this
where
the
person
comes
in
and
says
i
quit
my
job
because
i
am
a
legal
stenographer
and
everyone
told
me
that
legal
stenographer's
jobs
are
available
all
over
the
place
and
i
had
specific
position
that
i
had
in
mind
and
now
two
weeks
later
i
find
that
the
position
is
not
available
and
it
is
not
so
easy
to
find
a
legal
stenographer's
job.
that
statement
itself
because
of
it
is
internal
credibility
might
be
sufficient
whereas
statement
that
justice
white
posited
earlier,
no
i
did
not
quit
my
job
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
public
assistance
might
not
be
credible
evidence
sufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption,
but
--
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
there
are
two
regulations
assuming
--
ms.
amy
juviler
right.
ms.
amy
juviler
the
regulations
appear
as
an
appendix
to
our
main
brief.
these
are
regulations
which
govern
the
application
procedure
and
discuss
the
duties
of
the
local
agency
to
investigate.
they
discuss
the
duties
of
the
local
agency
to
inform
the
recipient
of
ineligibility
and
only
to
make
finding
of
a
--
ms.
amy
juviler
at
1(a),
and
let
me
particularly
draw
your
attention
to
page
5(a).
this
deals
with
the
conditions
prior
to
a
finding
of
ineligibility.
applications
are
denied
not
accepted
for
assistance
when
in
the
course
of
the
application
interview,
the
information
given
by
applicant
establishes
without
the
need
for
further
investigation
that
he
is
ineligible.
ineligibility
is
determined
in
the
course
of
or
upon
completion
of
investigation
or
if
the
applicant
refuses
to
comply
with
any
requirement
essential
to
the
determination
of
eligibility.
further
more
the
finding,
the
finding
that
must
be
made
within
30
days
unless
there
is
specific
adjournment
granted
to
the
applicant
to
produce
additional
information
and
there
is
a
specific
duty
at
a
page
3(a)
3515
for
the
applicant
to
produce
the
information
and
be
informed
of
his
duty
to
produce

specifically
at
351.2
appearing
in
pages
2(a)
and
3(a)
he
must
produce
evidence
of
his
resources
and
the
basic
duty
is
at
page
1(a),
the
responsibility
for
the
furnishing
information,
“the
social
services
official
should
provide
applicants
and
recipients
and
others
who
may
inquire
with
clear
and
detailed
information,
concerning
programs
of
public
assistance,
eligibility
requirements
therefore,
and
methods
of
investigation
and
benefits
available
under
such
programs.
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
juviler
they
do
have.
many
different
detailed
pamphlets
are
available
and
those
--
ms.
amy
juviler
yes,
there
--
ms.
amy
juviler
i
believe
that
the
court
can
decide
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
opportunity
to
rebut
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
not
only
130-10811,
but
face
of
the
regulations
and
the
statue
in
effect.
however,
the
court
might
prefer
to
remand
it
for
consideration
in
difference
to
the
court
below
which
specifically
said
it
was
reaching
the
question.
the
reason
after
all
i
framed
the
questions
and
i
will
answer
you
in
a
more
informal
and
direct
way
because
of
the
footnote
in
the
opinion
below,
i
did
not
feel
that
we
could
present
this
case
to
the
court
without
answering
what
we
regarded
as
specific
mis-statements
about
the
procedures
available.
and
it
was
not
in
knowing
thought
with
which
we
framed
that
question
and
presented
it
to
the
court
because
we
thought
the
footnotes
in
the
decision
presented
enough
question
as
to
procedures.
the
particular
footnote,
i
have
reference
to
is
where
court
said
there
is
no
opportunity
to
rebut
before
you
get
to
the
fair
hearing
and
we
think
that
is
decidedly
not
the
case
and
could
not
leave
that
unanswered.
in
fairness
to
our
opponents
would
not
just
stick
in
as
a
footnote
ourselves
and
we
decided
to
put
it
on
--
ms.
amy
juviler
he
was
making
2.25
an
hour,
i
think
40
hours
a
week,
he
was
guaranteed
40
hour
a
week
and
he
was
making
2.25,
not
much.
thank
you
very
much.
