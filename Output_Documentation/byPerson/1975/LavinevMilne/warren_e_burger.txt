first
this

in
74-1137,

against
milne.
mrs.
juviler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
what
you
are
saying
to
us
now
that
this
injunction
does
in
fact
impinge
upon
the
substantive
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
norlander.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
mr.
norlander,
the
legislature
of
the
state
to
constitutionally
provide
no
one
would
be
eligible
for
any
benefits
of
any
kind
for
75
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
you
say
about
a
state's
action
in
providing
for
no
welfare
or
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
welfare
program
and
rejecting
all
matching
funds
of
the
federal
government
and
saying
in
this
state,
we
are
not
going
to
have
any
program.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
burden
to
establish
eligibility
differ
from
the
burden
to
rebut
the
presumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
is
one
of
the
things
he
must
show
that
he
did
not
voluntarily
leave
his
job?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
any
of
these
facts
that
you
have
been
talking
about
have
anything
to
do
with
the
declaration
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
it
is
face?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
does
help
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
term
used
by
that
commission
is
“most?”
if
they
are
substantial
number,
who
do
otherwise,
does
not
warrant
the
legislative
presumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
accepting
this
as
a
evidence
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
is
not
necessarily
the
case,
accepting
it
as
what
someone
thought
about
it,
it
does
not
support
your
position
even
as
you
read
it
to
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
