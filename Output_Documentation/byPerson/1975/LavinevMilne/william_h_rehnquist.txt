justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
why
new
york
could
not
have
provided
that
no
person
should
be
eligible
for
home
aid
until
75
days
after
he
voluntarily
quit
his
job?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
new
york
scheme
is
actually
more
liberal
in
that
regard
than
say
new
jersey
that
you
correctly
described
new
jersey?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
raise
any
problem
at
all
on
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
taking
the
chief
justice's
question,
it
is
not
any
withdrawing,
if
it
is
simply
saying
70
per
75
days
after
you
voluntarily
quit
your
work,
you
are
not
eligible
for
work,
for
welfare.
i
cannot
imagine
that
would
violate
equal
protection
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
does
the
constitution
prevent
that
result?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
is
up
to
the
new
york
legislature
to
decide
what
would
advance
and
what
will
not
advance
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
issued
pursuant
to
the
mandate
or
order
of
the
court
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
is
the
court
saying
the
constitution
requires
it,
rather
than
the
choice
of
the
department
of
social
service?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
the
court
has
no
business
telling
the
department
of
social
services
anything,
other
than
it
be
mandated
by
the
constitution?
