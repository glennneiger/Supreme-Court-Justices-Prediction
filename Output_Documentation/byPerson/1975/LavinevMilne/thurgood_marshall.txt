temporary
would
be
maladministration
to
this
case
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
was
saying
before
was
the
knocking
down
of
the
statutory
being
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
the
people
you
represent,
they
quit
their
job
or
either
one
of
them
for
this
is
why
i
see
the
difference
and
you
do
not
expect
and
a
lot
of
that
people
come
to
him
and
says,
here
is
the
money,
they
have
to
go
and
ask
for
it,
do
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
do
not
they
have
to
“qualify?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
in
administering
the
qualifications
standards
the
officer
does
wrong,
is
that
ground
for
knocking
out
the
statute,
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
answers
no,
is
not
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)_
that
out
as
applied,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
validity,
the
facial
validity
of
the
statute
is
what
is
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
the
man
applied
for
home
relief
and
the
worker
says
did
she
quits
her
job
within
the
last
75
days,
and
he
said
yes,
he
says
why?
is
he
not
obliged
to
say
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
not
obliged
to
give
in
great
detail,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
with
that
presumption
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.

much
he
was
making?
