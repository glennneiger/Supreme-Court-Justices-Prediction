they
would
be
--
say
that
we
are
on
the
high
seas,
actually
they
would
be
in
the
florida
territorial
waters
for
the
real,
would
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
follow
the
same
course
that
we
used
to?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
straits
of
florida?
justice
potter
stewart
the
east
coast
of
florida?
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
while
in
the
territorial
waters
of
texas,
while
they
are
in
the
gulf?
justice
potter
stewart
they
pilot
each
area?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
are
in
the
territorial
waters
of
florida,
i
must
say
if
they
follow
the
normal
traders
for
a
while?
justice
potter
stewart
on
whose
expertise?
i
do
not
think
the
geography
has
changed.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
i
have.

(inaudible)
non-right
to
work
states,
although
the
crew
generally
goes
to
the
shore
on
leave
during
the
loading
and
unloading
operation?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
say
that
the
federal
policy
is
neutral,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
which
involved
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
sit
down,
perhaps
if
you
have
not
thought
about
this,
you
would
be
thinking
about
it
while
you
are
sitting
down.
this
is
a
matter
of
construing
the
language
of
14(b)
which
appears
on
page
14?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
phrase
in
any
state
or
territory
in
which
such
so
on
modifies
employment
or
does
it
modify
execution
or
application
of
agreements?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
the
employment
must
be
in
any
state
or
territory
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
was
not
a
departure
from
the
true
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
the
early
board
cases
were
to
which
you
are
referring
are
the
giant
food
and
northern
greyhound
and
western
electric?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
requirement
of
a
boat?
justice
potter
stewart
that
basic
issue
is
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
--
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
or
not
you
think
those
cases
where
rightly
or
wrongly
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
right
or
wrong,
but
--?
justice
potter
stewart
my
second
question
is
do
you
think
these
cases
help
you
in
your
position
in
this
case
or
hurt
you?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
white,
did
you
agree
that
this
case
was
properly
decided
and
should
be
confined
to
maritime
employment
or
did
you
take
the
view
that
it
has
a
considerably
broader
application?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
in
those
early
nlrb
cases,
which
were
decided,
one
in
1947
and
one
in
1948
and
one
in
1949
i
think,
you
said
they
were
different
because
they
involved
two
competing
--
two
or
more
competing
states
whereas
in
this
case
you
just
have
the
state
of
texas
on
the
one
hand
vis-a-vis
no
state?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
this
a
case
that
just
involves,
the
state
of
texas,
a
state
versus
no
state
or
should
it
--
does
its
impact
go
further
involving
--
two
cases
involving
a
competition
between
or
among
two
or
more
states?
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
to
work
law
or
8(a)(3)?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
question,
if
i
am
wrong
