you
would
not
distinguish
between
the
60
and
the
40
in
your
presentation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
with
your
current
attention
is.
as
i
read
the
brief,
the
first
thing
on
page
15
was
a
quote
from
judge
ainsworth,
rather
than
a
quote
of
the
solicitor
general
himself
and
i
do
not
think
you
directly
quoted
the
language
on
page
11
either,
does
it
say
exactly
what
you
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
did
not
find,
let
me
just
put
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
a
statement
that
they
all
work
outside
its
borders,
it
is
not
a
statement
that
none
of
them
were
within
its
borders?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
disagreeing
with
finding
18(a)
that
they
quote
that
says,
“80
to
90%”
is
on
the
high
seas
or
in
ports
other
than
texas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
other
finding
with
respect
to
the
percentage
of
work
that
is
within
or
without
texas
other
than
18(a)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
to
go
beyond
that
we
have
to
go
to
the
record,
the
original
record?
