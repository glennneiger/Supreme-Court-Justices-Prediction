mr.
james
w.
hambright
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
members
of
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
texas
has
sufficient
interest
in
the
employment
relationship
between
respondent
and
the
employees
in
its
tanker
fleet
headquartered
at
beaumont
so
that
under
section
14(b)
of
the
nlra,
as
amended,
that
texas
right
to
work
law
applies
to
the
agency
shop-clause
in
that
agreement.
the
trial
court
said
that
it
did.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
trial
court
was
correct.
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
primarily
for
the
reason
that
congress
has
made
no
exception
as
to
seafaring
of
maritime
employees
under
the
taft-hartley
act
as
it
did
under
the
railway
labor
act
for
airline
pilots
and
train
crews
and
for
the
further
reason
your
honors
that
the
employment
relationship
in
this
case
is
centered
in
texas.
we
start
with
the
problem
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
your
honor,
i
think
in
this
case
we
have
so
much
more
than
the
work.
we
have
the
hiring,
firing,
and
paying.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
your
honor,
the
14(b)
speaks
in
terms
of
execution
or
application
and
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
situation
where
under
the
phrase
“application”
that
i
could
be
here
before
you
if
there
was
utterly
no
work
done
in
the
state
where
i
was
urging
that
the
contract
was
a
duplication.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
in
that
connection
your
honor,
we
come
back
to
the
phrase
“execution”
and
that
is
what
your
question
is
directed
toward
and
in
looking
through
the
legislative
history,
i
found
nothing
to
indicate
whether
they
meant
execution
to
mean
signing
the
document
or
performing
the
work
because
execution
when
you
execute
a
contract,
sometimes
it
means
you
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
contract.
so,
without
research
in
that
area
and
looking
out
has
turned
out
nothing,
i
would
have
to
say
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
oh!
no,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position
that
under
the
phrase
“application”
there
comes
things
such
as
enforcement
of
the
agency-shop
clause
itself.
justice
douglas
held
that
in
the
schermerhorn
the
second,
the
second
schermerhorn
case
which
this
court
unanimously
decided
in
1963
when
he
said
that
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
that
the
language
of
the
section
means
that
the
act
shall
not
be
construed,
authorized
any
“application”
of
a
union
security
contract
such
as
discharging
an
employee
which
under
the
circumstances
is
prohibited
by
the
state.
the
legislative
history
of
the
section
would
dispel
it.
so
therefore,
your
honor,
i
think
that
when
we
speak
of
application,
we
cannot
just
look
at
work
as
my
colleague
has
suggested,
but
we
must
look
at
things
such
as
the
enforcement
of
a
union
security
clause
and
this
court
has
squarely
noticed
of
that
distinction.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
we
start
with
the
proposition
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
cooley
case
that
a
state
can
enact
a
law
regulating
maritime
commerce,
if
the
state
law
covers
the
matter
and
not
requiring
a
single
uniform
rule
nationally
and
if
the
state
law
is
not
conflict
with
the
national
law.
now,
in
this
situation,
on
the
question
of
uniformity
congress
says
there
shall
be
this
uniformity
in
the
area
of
right
to
work.
again,
in
the
schermerhorn
the
second
opinion
which
i
have
referred
to,
justice
douglas
wrote
for
the
unanimous
court
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law,
but
it
is
a
conflict
sanctioned
by
congress
with
directions
to
give
the
state
the
right
of
way
to
state
laws
barring
the
execution
and
enforcement
of
union
security
agreements
and
he
used
the
word
enforcement.
he
did
not
say
execution
and
application
as
the
statute
does,
he
departed
just
a
little
bit
and
said
the
execution
and
enforcement.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
i
think,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
the
enforcement
is
part
of
the
application,
yes
sir.
and
on
this
uniformity
point,
he
further
said
that
congress
in
other
words
chose
to
abandon
any
search
for
uniformity
in
dealing
with
the
problems
of
state
laws
barring
the
execution
and
application,
he
is
back,
mr.
justice
he
is
back
on
state
laws
and
application
of
agreements
authorized
by
14(b)
and
decided
to
suffer
a
medley
of
attitudes
and
philosophies
on
the
subject.
so
in
that
regard,
i
think
it
will
be
well
to
see
what
we
have
here
on
the
subject
of
uniformity
from
the
solicitor
general
who
filed
a
brief
at
the
invitation
of
this
court.
in
his
brief
and
that
is
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
on
page
14,
he
said
that
he
agreed
that
the
united
states
agrees
that
a
state
right
to
work
law
can
be
applied
to
the
maritime
industry.
that
is
what
he
came
up
with
your
honors,
after
looking
it
over.
now,
he
filed
three
briefs
with
you.
the
first,
he
filed
a
memorandum
urging
you
to
grant
this
writ.
then
he
filed
a
brief
with
you
and
then
he
filed
a
reply
to
our
brief.
so
i
am
talking
about
his
primary
brief.
he
says
in
there
that
the
united
states
agrees
that
a
state
right
to
work
law
can
be
applied
to
the
maritime
industry.
then
he
further
says
on
that
same
page
that
section
14(b)
of
taft-hartley
contains
no
exclusion
for
maritime
workers
as
does
the
railway
labor
act.
then
he
further
said
that
congress
expressly
permits
diversity
of
regulation
as
to
union
security
and
then
his
grand
finale
which
i
think
is
most
pertinent
here,
he
says
maritime
commerce
would
not
necessarily
be
disrupted
or
hindered
by
the
application
to
different
ships
or
different
employers
of
different
union
security
rules.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
sir,
he
seemed
to
find
nothing
wrong
with
the
idea
that
texas
law
might
well
apply
to
these
employees.
he
only
felt
that
texas
had
an
insufficient
contact.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir.
his
test
on
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
his
test,
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
on
page
15
and
i
quote
his
test,
“a
state
has
sufficient
interest
in
the
employment
relationship
only
if
the
employee
performs
some
work
within
the
state.”
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
mr.
justice,
it
is.
he
said
that
texas
does
not
have
sufficient
interest
then
at
the
job
situs
in
his
view
is
predominant,
but
let
me
explain
how
i
think
he
arrived
at
that
and
perhaps
dropped
the
bowl.
in
his
brief,
on
page
15
and
i
am
speaking
of
his
primary
brief,
seven
lines
down,
he
states,
“these
employees
perform
no
work
whatever
in
texas.
he
is
quoting
there
judge
ainsworth
from
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
that
is
one
thing
he
says
on
page
15
then
on
page
18
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
his
primarily
brief
your
honor
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
solicitor
general’s
brief,
page
15.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir.
that
is
right,
seven
lines
down
in
the
footnote.
i
am
sorry.
he
says
these
employees
perform
no
work
whatever
in
texas.
then
your
honor,
on
page
18
which
is
coincidentally
18
lines
down,
he
says
you
can
only
perform
a
union
security
clause
where
work
is
done
or
where
dues
are
collected
and
all
these
events
take
place
outside
texas.
the
work
is
performed
at
sea.
the
dues
are
deducted
from
wages
paid
at
sea.
then
he
goes
on
and
on
page
7,
line
5,
he
says
in
referring
to
this
workforce,
a
group
of
workers
who
perform
their
work
outside
the
boundaries
of
any
state.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
he
acknowledges
that
he
has
misstated
the
facts.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
but
the
thrust
of
his
job
situs
test
is
that
there
is
no
work
done
in
texas
because
he
says
your
honor
that
it
must
be
a
state
where
some
work
is
done.
he
lays
that
down
in
his
primary
brief
there.
then
again
in
his
primary
brief
on
page
11,
line
8,
he
says
texas
cannot
impose
its
judgment
on
a
seaman,
all
of
whom
work
and
are
paid
outside
its
borders.
now,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
this
is
not
in
accord
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
on
page
11,
he
says,
how
can
it
impose,
he
is
speaking
of
texas,
how
can
it
impose
its
judgment
upon
the
seaman
involved
in
the
instant
case,
all
of
them
work
and
are
paid
outside
its
borders?
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
it
is
about
seven
lines
down.
so,
my
point
is
that
on
four
different
pages
of
this
brief
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
alright
your
honor,
yes
sir.
now,
in
point
of
fact,
the
findings
of
fact
show
that
all
of
these
seamen
do
work
in
texas.
they
all
come
there
regularly
and
repetitively.
it
shows
that
the
voyages
normally
start
and
stop
in
texas.
it
shows
--
the
statement
of
findings
of
fact
on
appendix
page
29,
states
that
a
more
substantial
part
of
the
administration
of
the
bargain
agreement
occurs
in
texas
than
in
any
other
state.
now,
on
the
question
of
payment,
the
solicitor
speaks
about
collection
of
dues,
he
says,
they
are
deducted
from
the
wages
paid
at
sea.
the
facts
show
that
these
dues
are
computed
and
deducted
in
beaumont,
that
they
are
mailed
off
from
texas.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
ties
in
with
this
concept
we
think
the
--
there
is
an
exhibit
that
shows
that
in
the
representative
year,
there
is
about
a
$6
million
payroll
and
of
these
amount
money,
only
about
$1,900,000.00
is
carried
aboard
ship
for
payment
in
cash
to
the
seamen,
but
the
other
$4
million,
the
payment
of
that
occurs
within
texas.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
partially,
in
texas
your
honor
and
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
more
so
than
in
any
other
of
the
states
though.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
oh!
no
sir.
that
is
correct,
but
this
money
is
paid
in
this
manner.
the
seamen
can
designate
an
allotment
to
their
families,
so
that
they
do
not
take
the
money
themselves.
it
is
mailed
direct
to
their
families
and
all
of
this
handled
in
beaumont
and
there
is
well
over
a
million
dollars
a
year
disbursed
in
that
manner.
furthermore,
the
record
shows
that
these
seamen
worked
for
90
days
in
their
our
own
vacation
30
days,
but
they
remain
a
continuous
employee
all
along
and
the
30-day
portion
of
their
wages
of
course
comes
directly
from
texas
too
and
then
of
course
the
withholding
tax
is
deducted
in
beaumont
and
paid
in
austin
at
the
irs
office.
so
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
your
honor,
the
record
shows
that
out
289,
123
reside
in
texas.
it
shows
that
10
in
rhode
island,
10
in
maine,
13
in
louisiana,
16
in
florida,
21
in
new
jersey
and
60
in
new
york
and
then
there
are
36
others
in
16
other
states
each
having
fewer
than
six.
now,
the
designated
shipping
port
for
these
men,
a
152
of
them
have
designated
beaumont
as
their
shipping
port.
the
others
are
providence,
rhode
island
and
some
in
new
york,
but
the
residence
of
these
gentlemen
of
course
is
a
matter
that
the
authors
of
the
harvard
law
review
took
into
account
when
they
discussed
this
case.
they
held
our
opine
much
as
the
attorney
general
did
that
texas
does
have
the
right
to
have
this
right
to
work
law
and
that
there
is
no
exemption
for
blue
water
maritime
seaman.
in
fact
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
[laughter]we
view
them
a
lot
more
attention
than
we
do
than
some
of
the
reading
matter,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
i
viewed
it
with
great
authority
as
it
came
down
point
by
point
in
support
of
what
the
en
banc
panel
said
until
they
got
again
to
the
bottom-line
in
which
they
said,
apart
from
my
brother
here,
they
said
--
the
harvard
law
review
article
does
not
say
that
job
situs
is
the
test.
they
said
that
residents
ought
to
be
the
test.
they
said
that
the
court
did
have
power
to
expunge
this
agency-shop
clause,
but
they
suggested
that
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
we
did
it
only
in
part
and
if
we
split
it
up
and
let
it
go
away
with
respect
to
the
texas
residents,
but
those
from
the,
as
the
authors
there
said,
the
new
york
contingent,
let
it
remain
as
to
them.
now,
of
course
the
thing
wrong
with
that
bottom-line
approach
is
as
this
court
knows
in
the
hk
porter
company
case,
this
court
held
that
the
court
cannot
tell
parties
what
to
put
in
their
labor
contract
and
cannot
tell
them
to
modify
their
clauses,
but
can
only
tell
them
to
bargain.
so,
i
think
the
harvard
people
were
on
the
right
track
until
they
got
down
to
the
theory
part
of
it
and
of
course
there
is
another
impediment
to
that
also.
union
counsel
at
the
trial
of
this
case
told
judge
fischer
said,
your
honor,
that
there
is
no
way
the
court
can
carve
on
this
case
with
sufficient
delicacy
to
split
up
the
coverage
of
this
clause.
that
is
in
the
record
here,
but
that
is
what
he
told
the
trial
court
and
then
again
the
harvard
people
i
think
may
have
disregarded
the
fact
that
it
is
not
just
texas
and
new
york,
but
that
some
of
these
people
live
in
seven
or
eight
other
states
as
well.
now,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
would
like
to
speak
just
a
moment
about
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
no
sir,
i
do
not
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
you
should
in
this
case
go
into
a
sweeping
decision
as
to
--
of
that
nature
and
the
reason,
if
this
is
so,
it
is
that
this
case
does
not
concern
very
many
people.
the
solicitor
told
you
in
his
initial
memo
that
maybe
50,000
seamen
could
be
affected
by
it,
but
in
a
footnote
he
told
you
that
about
20,000
of
that
figure
which
he
got
from
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
were
supervisors
and
not
under
the
act
so
that
cuts
it
back
to
maybe
30,000,
but
the
biggest
distinction
is
he
was
speaking
of
people
that
work
under
maritime
contracts
as
we
normally
view
amount
of
of
hiring
halls
where
they
have
no
particular
company,
no
particularly
job
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
your
honor
it
has
to
do
with
a
company
headquartered
and
centered
with
its
employment
relation
as
this
company.
it
is
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
possible
it
could.
if
you
had
shoe
salesman
who
worked
on
in
another
state
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
it
might
have
your
honor
in
that
regard.
no
one
has
considered
that
approach
in
the
briefs
here
to
fore.
i
know
counsel
for
the
union
asked
the
clerk
for
an
extension
of
time
to
file
his
brief
here
so
he
could
check
with
the
other
maritime
unions.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
be,
if
all
--
if
every
fact
was
the
same
data,
indeed,
i
think
so.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
i
would
like
to
correct
if
i
may,
a
few
expressions
from
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
he
says
this
labor
contract
is
with
mobil
oil
corporation.
your
honors,
this
is
with
mobil
oil
corporation
and
marine
transportation
department
gulf
east
coast
operations.
the
importance
of
that
is
that
this
was
a
separate
employing
unit
and
the
multi-state
reciprocal
act
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
recognizes
that
in
maritime
employment,
unemployment
compensation
coverage
can
be
handled
with
the
state
where
the
headquarter
is
located.
it
refers
to
employing
unit
and
of
course,
i
think
we
have
rather
texas
flavor
to
the
case
perhaps
without
saying
that.
he
also
told
you
that
5%
is
closure
to
the
mark
as
to
the
amount
of
work
done
in
texas.
your
honors,
this
has
been
a
creeping
percentage.
in
the
union’s
initial
answer
they
said,
less
than
5%
of
the
work
was
done
in
texas,
but
when
it
came
time
to
submit
findings
of
fact
after
two-day
trial,
they
submitted
a
proposed
finding
in
which
they
got
it
up
to
10%
and
then
when
they
submitted
am
amended
--
a
proposed
amended
conclusion
of
law,
they
got
it
up
to
20%.
and
we
have
evidence
here
your
honors
that
puts
it
up
higher
than
that
because
these
ships
come
to
brownsville,
corpus
christi,
houston,
and
bay
town.
they
are
adding
topping
off
to
their
cargo,
then
they
go
up
east
and
discharge
and
they
come
back
in
ballast
and
the
proof
shows
there
is
a
grievance
here
where
a
man
--
that
ship
loaded
in
three
different
ports
and
he
(inaudible)
in
beaumont
and
he
wanted
penalty
pay
for
an
overtime
matter
because
it
had
been
in
all
those
ports.
so,
what
i
am
saying
to
this
court
is
that
more
than
20%
of
the
work
in
fact
is
done
within
the
territorial
waters
of
texas
in
the
normal
trade
and
further,
some
of
the
works
is
done
on
the
shore
in
texas.
the
labor
contract
which
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
no
sir,
i
am
not
disagreeing
with
that
because
the
court
uses
the
80
to
90
to
show
that
there
is
some
divergence
or
some
variation.
these
are
averages,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
no
sir,
there
is
not.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
that
is
correct
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
another
matter
that
we
have
is
this
business
of
the
old
board
cases
where
he
indicated
that
the
test
used
by
the
board
in
1948
which
was
one
year
after
taft-hartley
and
it
is
never
reverted
to
those
is
where
they
report
for
work,
where
they
are
paid
and
where
they
get
their
instructions.
i
would
like
for
the
court
to
know
that
these
ships
are
controlled
by
radio
from
beaumont
where
the
fleet
manager
is
located
and
the
fleet
marine
superintendent
speaks
everyday
on
the
radio
to
the
ship’s
masters,
that
is
in
the
record
on
appeal.
the
only
place
a
man
can
be
terminated
is
in
beaumont,
texas
and
there
is
an
exhibit
showing
a
letter
where
an
employee
was
indeed
terminated
in
beaumont
to
illustrate
that.
the
only
place
that
these
people
are
covered
by
unemployment
compensation
insurance
is
in
texas,
nowhere
else.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
your
honor
and
they
were
decided
under
provision
that
was
repealed
by
congress
within
a
year
or
so
after
that
and
it
has
never
been
reenacted.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
prior
to
the
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
i
think
in
that
case
it
was
not
your
honor
for
this
reason.
in
those
cases,
the
question
was
which
state
law
applied
and
not
whether
any
state
law
applied.
so
i
think
they
can
be
distinguished
in
that
manner
as
well.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
your
honor,
under
the
facts
then
before
the
board,
just
from
reading
the
cases,
i
would
say
that
they
were
decided
in
accord
with
expediency
for
the
board’s
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
[laughter]your
honor,
i
do
not
think
this
will
ever
be
a
problem
to
the
board.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
in
those
cases
your
honor,
i
think
they
help
us
because
they
say
you
look
to
the
focal
point
of
the
relationship
and
they
examined
everything,
not
just
the
work.
they
examined
where
are
they
paid,
where
are
they
instructed,
where
do
they
report
and
the
record
shows
that
all
289
of
these
employees
regularly
report
to
beaumont
at
one
time
or
another
to
catch
their
ship,
for
the
beginning
of
the
voyage,
that
is
in
the
record.
so
they
use
a
multi-dimensional
analysis
and
i
think
that
is
what
this
court
should
do
and
like
the
fifth
circuit
did
and
if
that
is
done,
if
you
look
at
the
whole
employment
relationship,
your
honor,
i
submit
there
will
be
no
problem
whatsoever
to
the
board
in
future
deals
in
this
area.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
they
regularly
and
repetitively
go
to
beaumont.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
yes
sir,
they
get
report
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
oh!
your
honor,
they
do
at
times,
but
they
also
fly.
sometimes,
they
fly
to
catch
the
ship
there
because
they
get
a
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
when
their
work
cycle
is
over,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
90
days
is
over
and
they
go
ashore.
thirty
days
later,
they
have
to
catch
a
ship
again.
that
decision
is
--
mr.
james
w.
hambright
very
often.
that
is
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
hambright
no
sir,
i
said
that
regularly
and
repetitively,
they
do
catch
ships
in
beaumont,
not
every
time,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
your
honor.
another
thing
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
application
of
a
labor
contract
is
the
handling
of
grievances.
the
record
shows
that
23
out
of
27
top
level
grievances
were
heard
in
beaumont,
texas
in
this
case
and
only
four
went
to
arbitration.
now,
that
is
a
pretty
important
aspect
of
labor
relations.
all
of
the
employees
get
their
mail
in
beaumont.
the
ones
in
new
york,
they
are
no
exception
when
they
come,
when
the
first
come
with
company,
this
did
not
show
up
in
the
appendix
too
well,
but
they
get
this
welcome
aboard
(inaudible)
and
in
there,
it
says
that
your
mailing
address
shall
be
p.o.
box
so
and
so,
beaumont,
texas,
so
that
it
just
one
more
indication
of
the
fact
that
the
employment
relationship
is
actually
centered
in
texas
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
bear
in
mind
that
these
are
not
hiring
hall
seamen.
these
are
not
seamen
who
were
sitting
around
waiting
and
hoping
that
the
might
get
a
job.
so,
where
the
arms
of
admiralty
around
these
people
with
the
special
privileges
affording
seafaring
men
when
they
do
not
have
a
job
at
all
and
in
our
case,
these
men
have
a
permanent
lifetime
job.
thank
you,
your
honors.
