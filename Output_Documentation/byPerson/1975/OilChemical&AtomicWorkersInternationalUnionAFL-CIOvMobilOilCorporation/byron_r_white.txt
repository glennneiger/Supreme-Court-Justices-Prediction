but
every
employee
does
some
of
his
work
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
20%?
10
to
20%?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
if
the
contract
is
executed
in
texas
and
exactly
50%
of
the
work
was
done
in
texas
and
50%
done
in
the
state
that
does
not
have
a
right
to
work
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
of
the
job
has
to
be
performed
in
the
state
with
the
right
to
work
law
before
that
law
is
applicable?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
bargaining
contract
covers
workers
in
two
different
states
and
some
workers
do
all
their
work
in
one
state
and
other
workers
do
all
their
in
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
bargaining
contract
has
to
reflect
both
things,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
(inaudible)
the
place
of
contracting
is
not
very
important?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
agreement,
i
suppose,
means
collective
bargaining
agreement,
there
is
enough
clearly?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not,
i
take
that
you
would
not
be
here
if
none
of
the
work
was
done
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
an
agreement
is
negotiated
and
executed
in
texas,
covering
employees
working
in
two
different
plants,
one
in
texas
and
one
in
louisiana,
the
law
of
louisiana
rather
than
in
texas
would
govern
the
employees
working
at
louisiana
plant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
difference
in
this
case
is
that
10
to
20%
of
the
work
in
addition
was
done
in
texas?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
you,
i
take
that
your
position
is
that
the
act
should
be
construed
so
that
only
one
law
applies
under
any
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
position
has
only
to
do
with
maritime
employment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose,
would
you
have
the
same
problem,
would
you
not,
if
you
had
exactly
the
same
facts
except
that
80%
of
the
employment
was
not
done
on
the
high
seas,
but
in
another
state
without
it
right
to
work
law,
everything
else
is
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
might
have
a
quite
wide
impact?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
all
the
facts
were
the
same
except
that
80%
of
the
work
was
not
done
on
the
high
seas,
but
in
another
state
without
a
right
to
work
law,
would
you
--
your
position
would
be
the
same
that
texas
would
be
entitled
to
import
the
right
to
work
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold
is
that
possible
between
states,
is
there
--
if
the
state
does
not
have
a
right
to
law,
the
federal
law
governs,
so
it
is
always
a
question
of
either
state
or
federal
laws.
it
is
not
a
question
which
state
law.
it
is
a
question
of
state
or
federal
law,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
do
not
understand.
i
thought
you
indicated
to
me
that
this
decision
that
you
would
be
here
even
if
80%
of
the
work
was
done
in
louisiana
rather
than
on
the
high
seas?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
said
you
would
be
here,
(inaudible)
louisiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
are
at
80%
of
this
work;
all
the
facts
were
the
same
except
the
work
here
was
done
--
80%
of
it
was
done
in
louisiana
on
dry
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
are
plunking
for
the
same
standard
the
board
applied
in
those
older
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
headquarters
sort
of
approach?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
certainly
involved
more
than
where
the
work
was
done?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
on
the
drilling
platforms?
