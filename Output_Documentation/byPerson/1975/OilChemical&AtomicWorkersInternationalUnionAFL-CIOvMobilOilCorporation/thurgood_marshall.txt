this
agreement,
74-1254
of
chemical
and
atomic
workers.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioner
union
and
respondent
employer
headed
in
to
a
collective
bargain
agreement
covering
seamen
employed
on
respondent's
oil
tankers.
the
agreement
contained
an
agency-shop
provision
requiring
all
employees
within
30
days
of
being
on
it
to
pay
the
union
be
equivalent
of
the
union
initiation
fees
and
to
make
periodic
payments
equal
to
union
dues.
two
years
after
entering
into
the
agreement,
respondent
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
claiming
that
the
context
between
the
employment
relationship
in
question
and
the
state
of
texas
were
sufficient
to
make
texas
laws
applicable
and
that
the
agency
shop
provision
was
therefore
invalid
and
unenforceable
because
it
violated
texas
right-to-work
laws.
the
district
court
granted
respondent
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
we
granted
certiorari,
we
now
reversed.
section

(a)
(3)
of
the
national

or

agreements
between
employers
and
unions.
but

to
exempt
themselves
from
the
policy.
and

states
can
imply
their
right-to-work
laws
only
to
employment
relationships
with
which
they
have
sufficient
contact.
we
conclude
for
reasons
detailed
in
our
opinion
filed
today
that
job
situs
is
the
critical
factor
in
determining
whether
a
state
has
that
sufficient
contact.
since
in
this
case,
all
the
employees
perform
most
of
their
work
not
in
texas
but
that
rather
on
high
seas.
texas
right-to-work
laws
are
therefore
not
applicable
under
14
(b).
accordingly
the
agency-shop
agreement
between
petitioners
and
respondents
is
valid
and
enforceable.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
statement,
chief
justice
has
concurred
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
joined.
