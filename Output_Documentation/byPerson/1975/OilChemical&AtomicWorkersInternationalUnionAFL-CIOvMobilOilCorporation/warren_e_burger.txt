mr.
gold,
let
me
put
my
hypothetical
to
you
about
80%.
assume
that
20%
more
or
less
of
the
same
kind
of
work
and
same
kind
of
contacts
were
in
texas
with
a
company
and
80%
more
or
less,
towing
oil
rigs
across
the
gulf
and
around
florida
and
over
to
the
adriatic
sea
and
off
to
the
north
sea
as
it
is
done
as
you
know
and
otherwise
all
of
the
contacts
are
the
same,
no
states
other
than
texas,just
--
high
seas,
and
the
adriatic
sea
and
the
north
sea
in
selling
these
rigs
and
coming
back
and
loading
them
and
taking
some
more,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
