mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
it
was
filed
on
friday
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
26th.
mr.
laurence
gold
oh!
yes,
it
would
have
been
late
today,
but
unless
i
am
misinformed,
it
was
filed
friday
afternoon.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
we
will
check
with
the
clerk’s
office
and
apologize.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
that
court
en
banc
reversed
the
panel
decision
and
held
that
the
agency-shop
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
question
here
contravene
texas’
law
prohibiting
such
forms
of
union
security.
that
clause
is
as
common
required
the
payment
of
dues
by
employees
who
have
completed
30
days
of
employment
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment.
the
collective
agreement
here
is
between
the
oil,
chemical
and
atomic
workers’
union
and
it
is
local
and
the
mobil
oil
corporation
and
the
agreement
covers
unlicensed
seamen
who
work
on
the
corporation’s
tankers
which
ply
the
high
seas
between
texas
and
the
eastern
ports
and
also
on
occasion
between
foreign
ports.
the
clause
in
question
is
set
out
at
page
281
of
the
printed
appendix
and
the
entire
agreement
is
at
pages
280
through
329.
we
believe
that
two
questions
are
presented.
the
first
is
whether
is
what
is
the
test
for
determining
whose
law
applies
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
an
agreement
is
negotiated
and
administered
in
the
different
states
and
work
is
performed
in
still
another
jurisdiction
and
there
are
contrasting
union
security
policies
in
all
three.
we
suggest
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction
where
the
bulk
of
the
work
is
performed
is
the
law
that
should
apply.
there
is
a
second
question
and
that
is
whether
the
test
we
have
just
stated
applies
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
one
of
the
jurisdictions
is
the
high
seas
or
whether
its
application
is
limited
to
cases
in
which
the
work
is
land-based
within
the
united
states.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
we
view
this
as
a
federal
statutory
case.
section
14(b)
sets
the
framework
for
the
case
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
case
which
is
in
the
area
of
constitutional
conflicts
of
laws.
very
summarily,
the
facts
are
these.
the
district
court
found
and
it
is
a
conservative
estimate
that
the
covered
seamen
do
80
to
90%
of
their
work
on
the
employer’s
tankers
that
i
have
just
described
while
those
tankers
are
on
the
high
seas
and
outside
the
boundary
of
any
state.
mr.
laurence
gold
they
are
on
--
mr.
laurence
gold
10
to
20%
is
the
estimate.
our
figures,
we
note
at
page
3
and
4
of
the
record
would
indicate
that
perhaps
it
is
closer
to
5%.
i
would
also
note
in
light
of
the
question
that
that
time
import
is
approximately
the
same
amount
of
time
spent
in
northern
ports
where
again,
the
seamen
are
on
ship
when
the
boat
is
under
pilot
and
when
it
is
being
loaded
and
unloaded
and
those
are
non-right
to
work.
mr.
laurence
gold
they
are
hired
principally
in
two
different
locations
as
the
record
shows,
perhaps
60%
in
texas
and
40%
in
northern
ports.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
lower
court
would
not
make
such
a
distinction.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
point
of
hire
or
the
point
of
residence
are
the
points
which
indicate
who
is
covered.
however,
if
you
had
a
unit
where
you
had
people
working
in
one
state
and
other
people
working
in
another
state,
then
we
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
difference
and
the
leading
nlrb
case
which
we
rely
on
makes
just
that
distinction.
there
are
bargaining
units
from
time
to
time
which
are
in
more
than
one
state.
the
district
court
held
that
since
the
mobil
oil
corporation’s
headquarters
for
--
administrative
headquarters
out
of
which
it
ran
its
american
flag
tanker
fleet
was
in
texas
that
the
greatest
part
of
the
administration
of
the
agreement
took
place
in
texas
when
you
compare
that
state
to
any
another
state.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
majority,
however,
gave
any
weight
to
any
of
the
activities
which
occurred
on
shipboard
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
as
i
have
already
stated,
it
is
our
view
that
really
the
only
operative
fact
that
is
relevant
here
is
the
fact
that
the
overwhelming
bulk
of
the
work
takes
place
on
ships
which
are
on
the
high
seas.
we
suggest
that
the
job
situs
is
the
appropriate
test
for
four
separate
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
job
situs
test,
we
believe
is
the
test
which
most
accurately
reflects
the
language
of
section
14(b)
which
is
the
operative
provision
of
the
federal
labor
law
in
question
here.
before
getting
to
that,
if
i
may
digress,
in
1947
there
was
a
complete
review
of
the
entire
question
of
union
security
by
the
congress
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments.
and
the
resolution
of
that
review
was
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
uniform
throughout
employment
in
this
country,
the
close-shop
which
requires
union
membership
at
the
time
of
hire
was
to
be
barred
that
no
employee
who
is
not
a
union
member
at
the
time
of
hire
could
be
required
to
join
the
union
for
the
first
30
days
or
pay
dues,
that
thereafter
there
was
nothing
in
federal
law
which
prohibited
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment
the
requirement
that
employees
pay
dues,
but
that
the
states
were
free
to
enact
their
own
policy
on
the
question
of
whether
after
the
30th
day
of
employment,
employees
could
be
required
to
pay
dues
or
become
union
members
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment.
we
think
that
that
background
is
relevant
because
it
indicates
a
congressional
determination
to
be
neutral
between
right
to
work
and
union
security
states.
both
policies
are
valid
under
the
national
labor
law
and
since
both
policies
are
valid,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
there
has
to
be
a
circumscribe
scope
for
the
policy
of
a
right
to
work
state
or
of
a
union
security
state
and
the
limitation
has
to
be
one
concerning
what
employment
relationships
are
centered
in
that
state
because
if
one
state
could
unless
export
its
policy
to
cover
employment
relationships
and
another
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
basic
policy
of
neutrality
and
the
question,
therefore,
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
employment
relationship?
where
is
the
center
of
the
employment
relationship?
as
i
have
indicated
before,
i
started
that
digression,
we
believe
it
is
the
place
where
the
employees
are
working
and
we
believe
that
that
is
the
test
first
of
all
which
does
the
best
service
to
the
language.
among
other
places,
section
14(b)
is
set
out
in
full.
it
is
a
short
provision
at
page
14
of
our
opening
brief,
the
brown
brief
for
petitioners.
it
is
phrased
as
a
permission
to
the
states
and
it
is
phrased
also
in
terms
of
covering
numerous
states.
to
put
it
in
focus,
we
think
that
a
fair
paraphrase
of
the
language
is
that
each
state
may
prohibit
the
execution
or
application
of
an
agreement
requiring
membership
in
a
labor
organization
as
a
condition
of
employment
in
that
state
or
territory.
and
we
think
that
on
the
normal
and
accepted
concept
of
where
is
somebody
employed
for
purposes
of
determining
what
his
permissible
conditions
of
employment
are
30
days
and
thereafter
during
his
tenure
of
employment,
it
is
a
place
where
he
is
working.
that
just
seems
to
us
to
be
the
common
sense
of
the
matter.
it
is
true
as
the
company
points
out
that
the
statute
prohibits
--
permits
the
state
to
prohibit
both
the
execution
and
application.
it
is
in
the
disjunctive.
either
one
or
both
may
be
prohibited
by
a
state,
but
we
do
not
think
that
that
cuts
against
our
argument
that
the
prohibition
has
to
relate
to
employees
who
are
working
in
that
state
because
with
the
common
sense
of
that,
we
believe
is
that
a
state
may
prohibit
execution
of
an
agreement
covering
employees
in
the
state
in
question
in
order
to
assure
that
the
agreement
can
be
declared
unlawful
before
anybody
is
discharged.
if
the
state
were
only
to
prohibit
application,
the
argument
could
have
been
made
we
take
it,
that
the
mere
execution
of
the
agreement
if
no
one
is
discharged
is
not
illegal
and
we
so
not
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
on
page
14
set
out
as
an
indented
quote
and
as
i
have
indicated
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
it
is
17,
if
i
have
my
numbers
corrected.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
i
believe
that
all
aside
from
louisiana
are
right
to
work
states.
on
the
other
hand
as
i
have
indicated,
these
voyages
typically
go
from
texas
to
new
york,
rhode
island,
and
new
jersey,
all
of
which
are
union
security
states.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
think
so
--
mr.
laurence
gold
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
—
mr.
laurence
gold
you
mean,
below
florida
and
under
t-west?
mr.
laurence
gold
all
i
can
say
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
my
understanding
of
the
record
is
that
it
is
conceded
or
found
rather
that
80
to
90%
of
their
work
takes
place
on
the
high
seas
outside
the
territorial
waters
of
any
state.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right.
they
come
into
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
afraid
that
your
expertise
on
that
matter
is
greater
than
mine.
mr.
laurence
gold
okay.
but
as
i
--
mr.
laurence
gold
[laughter]as
i
have
indicated
the
record,
the
facts
as
we
understand
them
as
the
district
court
found
them
are
that
such
vessels
are
located
on
the
high
seas
or
in
ports,
other
than
ports
located
in
the
state
of
texas
approximately
80%
to
90%
of
the
time
and
that
finding
is
set
out
at
page
8
of
our
brief
and
that
has
been
the
basis
upon
which
we
have
understood
the
case.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
record
indicates
that
the
crew
is
permitted
off
the
ship
when
they
are
not
standing
watches
or
otherwise
working
for
8
hours
at
a
time,
that
indicates
that
the
time
found
during
which
the
seamen
are
in
territorial
waters
aside
from
the
point
you
have
raised
mr.
justice
stewart
is
probably
less
if
anything
in
view
than
the
court
found,
if
we
look
at
working
time.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
laurence
gold
your
honor
and
i
would
say
by
the
same
token
that
if
all
the
facts
you
stated
were
true
and
the
occurrence
took
place
in
louisiana
and
the
employees
were
then
sent
to
texas,
the
texas
could
prohibit
application
of
that
agreement
or
it
was
executed
solely
to
cover
such
employees.
mr.
laurence
gold
prohibit
its
execution
maybe
an
improper
term,
but
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
i
believe
that
texas
in
the
situation
we
are
talking
about,
if
you
had
only
a
single
unit
of
such
employees,
could
enjoin
its
application
to
those
employees
and
i
would
think
that
it
was
true
if
the
agreement
was
negotiated
in
louisiana,
whether
if
both
of
the
signatory
parties,
namely
the
union
and
the
employer
were
located
in
louisiana
so
long
as
the
work
was
taking
place.
in
texas,
that
is
a
consequence
of
our
theory
and
we
think
that
that
neutral
principle
is
the
best
application
of
section
14(b)
not
because
we
believe
we
are
going
to
when
every
case
under
it,
but
because
it
makes
the
most
sense
for
all
the
reasons
that
i
am
trying
to
state.
obviously,
i
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
would
be
here
arguing
this
point
if
it
did
not
result
in
this
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
if
you
get
to
a
point
where
the
balance
is
absolutely
equal,
the
labor
board
and
to
sort
of
move
into
my
second
point
and
try
to
answer
that
question,
the
labor
board
very
early
on
had
to
deal
with
the
administration
of
a
provision
requiring
union-shop
elections
in
order
for
a
union-shop
provision
to
go
into
effect
and
it
had
to
deal
with
the
variety
of
questions
which
kind
of
rise
in
determining
which
law
applies
and
basically
what
the
labor
board
did
was
set
down
two
rules.
the
first
rule
is
the
job
site
of
the
employees
in
question
is
determinative.
the
second
rule
which
arouse
in
a
slightly
different
way
than
you
state,
but
it
is
equivalent
to
it
is
that
the
headquarters
of
the
employees,
the
place
where
they
are
paid,
receive
their
instructions
and
report
controls.
and
that
arouse
in
the
case
of
truck
drivers
going
through
many
states,
some
like
to
work,
some
union
security
and
the
board’s
conclusion
that
there
was
not
any
way
to
really
find
out
where
the
preponderant
amount
of
the
work
was,
the
board
nevertheless
said
that
since
we
are
focusing
on
the
situation
of
these
employees
whose
condition
of
continued
employment
is
in
question
was
the
issue
that
it
would
look
to
the
employee
headquarters
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
job
site.
we
think
that
that
was
a
sensible
principled
reading
of
the
statute
and
enjoys
and
gives
the
argument
we
make,
the
added
weight
set
out
in
cases
such
as
north
region
(ph),
nitrogen
(ph)
and
other
cases
which
talk
about
the
effect
of
a
rule
developed
by
an
administrative
agency
at
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
we
would
think
that
whichever
state
the
preponderance
of
the
work
was
done
ought
to
be
the
state
whose
law
control
and
i
would
take
it
that
there
will
be
some
cases
where
you
may
get
into
as
close
a
situation
as
you
envisage,
but
i
do
not
think
that
they
will
be
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
was
precisely
the
issue
that
first
faced
the
board
in
a
case
called
giant
food
which
we
cite
and
the
board
said
that
the
employees
who
worked
entirely
in
a
right
to
work
state
were
covered
by
the
right
to
work
law
and
the
employees
in
the
union
security
state
could
have
the
union
security
provision
applied
to
them
and
we
think
that
that
makes
the
very
best
sense
that
can
be
made
in
this
area
in
terms
of
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
is
right.
there
are
agreements
such
as
the
one
you
had
before
you
in
general
motors
where
you
have
plants,
i
have
no
idea
how
many
states,
but
in
a
very
vast
number
of
states
and
the
basic
reaction
of
the
court
was
that
obviously
the
indiana
law
would
apply
as
to
the
plants
in
indiana,
but
that
would
not
have
negated
the
agreement
as
to
the
employees
in
michigan.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
we
would
not
believe
that
it
ought
to
be
important.
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
in
employer-employee
relationships
is
that
we
can
count
on
the
employer
who
have
people
work
where
he
needs
them
and
on
the
other
hand,
where
an
agreement
is
negotiated,
may
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
situation
of
the
employees
and
what
is
the
rule
most
fairly
attuned
to
their
situation.
obviously,
if
the
rule
where
the
place
of
negotiation,
it
might
be
test
of
strength
about
where
an
agreement
was
to
be
negotiated.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
think
it
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
say
the
federal
conflicts
principle
is
neutral,
but
--
mr.
laurence
gold
what
i
was
attempting
to
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
that
the
federal
policy
is
neutral
between
law
givers.
normally,
if
the
federal
government
does
something,
it
is
supreme
by
the
fact
of
its
action.
here
in
8(a)(3),
the
federal
government
has
not
utilized
the
preemptive
powers
it
has
on
the
basis
of
the
commerce
clause,
but
again
because
it
seems
to
wrap
up
so
many
things,
i
go
back
to
the
first
labor
board
case,
this
giant
food
case
which
--
mr.
laurence
gold
--
which
involved
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
the
congress
has
never
enacted
a
right
to
work
law
for
any
federal
jurisdiction
in
which
it
has
the
same
type
of
exclusive
control
that
the
state
of
texas
has
within
texas.
and
in
that
sense,
the
federal
jurisdictions
are
union
security
jurisdictions
just
the
way
new
york
is.
most
union
security
states
do
not
have
a
law
saying
that
union
security
is
permissible.
there
is
the
absence
of
a
law
prohibiting
agreements
between
employers
and
unions
which
require
condition
of
continued
employment
and
the
federal
jurisdiction
such
as
the
district
of
columbia
is
that
type
or
jurisdiction.
now,
it
is
the
second
point
of
our
argument
that
the
high
seas,
an
american
flagship
on
the
high
seas
is
within
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
of
federal
maritime
jurisdiction
which
is
just
the
same
for
present
purposes
as
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
district
of
columbia.
so
you
do
have
in
terms
of
the
neutrality
of
conflicts
principle,
the
same
type
of
interests
at
stake
that
you
would
have
in
a
case
where
the
employees
spent
80
or
90%
of
their
time
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
10%
of
their
time
in
virginia.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
think
it
is
proper
to
do
so
for
the
reason
that
as
we
point
out
at
length
in
our
brief
and
as
judge
ainsworth
who
is
an
admiralty
and
maritime
lawyer
of
some
note,
pointed
out
in
his
dissent.
the
federal
government
has
always
regulated
the
employment
conditions
of
american
flagship
sailors
on
the
high
seas
in
the
way
that
states
have
regulated
employment
conditions
within
the
states.
indeed
the
federal
law
regulating
that
employment
relationship
was
far
more
detailed
i
think,
far
less
laissez-faire
than
a
comfortable
state
policy.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
make
the
point
in
our
reply
brief
that
we
think
--
the
only
thing
we
claim
and
i
hope
we
made
it
clearly
in
our
opening
brief
too,
the
only
think
we
claim
is
that
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
the
high
seas.
when
you
get
into
territorial
waters,
you
get
into
all
the
complexities
of
the
extent
to
which
the
state
law
and
the
federal
law
are
concurrent.
complexities
which
we
do
not
think
are
answered
by
any
of
this
court’s
precedence
that
we
know
and
nothing
that
we
are
arguing
here
would
prejudge
the
question
of
whether
the
state
right
to
work
law
would
be
pre-eminent
to
somebody
who
worked
solely
within
the
territorial
waters
are
primarily
within
the
territorial
waters
of
a
given
state.
i
would
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
our
view
it
modifies
employment
or
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
go
on
to
say
in
which
such
execution
or
application
is
prohibited.
in
other
words,
we
think
the
respondents
wish
to
suggest
that
this
provision
reads
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
as
authorizing
the
execution
or
application
of
agreements
requiring
membership
in
a
labor
organization
as
a
condition
of
employment
where
such
execution
or
application
is
prohibited
by
the
state
or
territorial
law.”
and
we
think
the
second
reference
indicates
that
the
focus
is
on
the
employee
who
we
are
trying
to
determine
may
have
to
pay
dues
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
again
to
go
on
with
some
of
the
examples
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
white,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
would
make
very
good
sense
to
say
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
an
agreement
is
negotiated
in
texas
and
all
the
work
is
to
be
done
in
louisiana,
that
this
was
intended
to
permit
texas
to
cancel
louisiana’s
choice
by
saying
you
are
foolish
enough
to
wander
into
our
state
to
execute
the
agreement
even
though
the
people
who
are
really
affected
by
it
are
not
really
working
here,
we
are
going
to
invalidate
the
agreement.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
light
of
your
opinion
in
kennel,
so
we
have
not
pressed
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
my
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
absolutely
the
case
only
involves
texas
vis-à-vis
the
admiralty.
there
is
no
showing
that
any
substantial
part
of
the
administration
of
this
labored
contract
occurs
elsewhere.
in
the
matter
of
money
for
instance,
it
is
$6million.
the
proof
shows
that
only
$67,000.00
was
disbursed
from
any
other
office,
less
than
1%.
so
it
is
so
tied
in
with
the
state
of
texas
that
you
really
need
not
bite
off
anymore
than
just
that
one
problem,
that
is
our
view.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir
and
of
course
they
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
if
it
was
in
the
same
fact
situation
your
honor,
it
may
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
not
sure
exactly
what.[laughter]
your
honor,
on
the
legislative
history,
you
wrote
the
opinion
in
schermerhorn
i
and
you
stated
in
that
case
which
was
a
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court,
you
stated
in
that
case
that
the
connection
between
8(a)(3)
and
section
14(b)
is
clear
and
whether
they
are
perfectly
coincident,
we
need
not
now
decide,
but
unquestionably
they
overlap
to
some
extent.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir,
i
would
be
here
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
laurence
gold
(laughter)thank
you.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
our
theory
mr.
chief
justice,
the
result
ought
to
be
the
same
because
the
work
would
be
on
american
flag
vessel
where
80
or
90%
of
the
work
was
being
done
on
the
high
seas
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
federal
jurisdiction
equivalent
to
the
district
of
columbia.
may
i
very
quickly
if
i
have
the
time
make
two
points.
first
of
all
up
until
in
1962,
this
employer
had
its
headquarters
in
new
york.
all
the
administrative
details
that
are
now
performed
in
texas
were
performed
in
new
york,
but
the
work
that
the
covered
employees
did
then
is
now
was
80%
on
the
high
seas.
we
do
not
understand,
if
we
look
at
this
in
terms
of
the
covered
employees
in
their
situation
why
there
should
be
a
different
result
because
the
employer
unilaterally
is
doing
his
paperwork
and
other
such
facts,
other
such
aspects
of
its
business
in
one
state
or
another.
the
one
factor
that
is
simple,
relatively
easy
to
understand
and
to
find
the
facts
about
is
where
is
the
work
being
done?
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
your
honor
because
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
first
case
as
i
have
indicated
was
the
giant
food
case
where
you
had
employees
who
stayed
in
a
particular
place.
half
of
them
in
virginia
and
half
of
them
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
board
said
that
the
job
site
was
controlling.
then
in
the
more
complicated
situation,
where
you
could
not
say
with
assurance
where
the
preponderance
of
the
work
was,
they
went
to
the
standard
that
you
are
discussing
and
we
agree
with
both
of
those
holdings.
we
think
there
is
sound
and
is
close
to
equity
as
one
is
going
to
get
in
this
area.
and
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
we
are
not
arguing
that
maritime
employees
are
exempt
from
right
to
work
laws.
as
i
have
indicated
in
trying
to
answer
mr.
justice
rehnquist
question,
we
think
it
is
an
entirely
different
matter
if
they
are
working
in
territorial
waters
and
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
gets
into
that
and
finally,
just
to
give
an
analogy
so
far
as
i
understand
it,
casinos
are
only
legally
run
in
nevada,
that
is
the
right
to
work
state,
the
job
situs
of
those
employees
is
nevada.
mr.
laurence
gold
on
the
drilling
platforms
i
would
say
that
it
depended
on
the
location
of
the
drilling
platforms
and
application
of
one
of
your
cases
whose
name
escapes
me
now
where
the
court
went
into
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
under
a
statute
of
congress
those
are
an
extension
of
the
state
or
within
the
federal
maritime
jurisdiction.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
your
honor,
i
think
in
that
case
you
would
be
into
the
situation
of
--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
right
and
that
would
be
like
bus
drivers
driving
through
many
states
and
the
headquarters
test
of
the
greyhound
case
would
apply.
