h.

mr.
gold,
you
do
not
rely,
do
you,
on
the
constitutional
conflicts,
principles
that
would
say
texas
did
not
have
enough
contact
with
this
contract
even
apart
from
federal
preemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
what
if
you
had
a
collective
bargaining
kind
of
executed
in
houston
or
beaumont
covering
workers
who
as
conceded
were
trained
in
texas
for
25
days
and
then
sent
somewhere
else
which
did
not
have
the
right
to
work
law,
would
you
say
that
texas
could
not
forbid
the
execution
of
that
sort
of
an
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
telling
that
you
probably
would?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely
texas
could
not
prohibit
its
execution
in
louisiana?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
one
could
conceive
your
two-state
analogy,
i
suppose,
saying
that
the
union
security
state
has
a
very
bit
as
much
right
to
have
its
policy
enforced
as
does
the
right
to
work
state
and
still
feel
that
here
the
result
might
come
out
differently
than
you
suggest
because
as
you
say
the
federal
policy
is
neutral.
you
do
not
have
a
pro-union
security
state
pooling
against
a
right
to
work
state,
but
it
is
basically
texas
versus
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
earlier
you
said
that
the
federal
policy
was
neutral
with
respect
to
right
to
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
you
can
draw
this
same
inference
from
congressâ€™
failure
to
legislate
with
respect
to
union
security
on
the
high
seas
that
you
could
from
its
failure
to
legislate
with
respect
to
union
security
or
its
absence
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
get
a
number
of
federal
labor
or
federal
maritime
enactments
that
would
apply
to
a
worker
within
a
3-mile
or
10-mile
territorial
limits
of
texas
waters,
could
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
feel
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
brief
are
you
referring
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
almost
a
semantical
point,
is
it
not?
i
mean,
they
are
deducted
from
wages,
the
residue
of
the
wages
being
paid
at
sea,
but
the
union
dues
are
in
fact
deducted
in
beaumont.
you
can
state
it
either
way,
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
the
evidence
is
a
real
or
factual
dispute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
harvard
law
review's
opinions
regarding
as
holdings
in
texas?
