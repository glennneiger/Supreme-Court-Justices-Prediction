justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
attacking
the
entire
mississippi
regulation
or
just
section
11
of
it?
justice
white
and
you
do
not
contest
those
provisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
would
not
insist
that
if
they
wanted
to
inspect
that
they
would
have
to
pay
the
cost,
you
would
pay
the
cost?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
it
would
burden
interstate
commerce
to
--
for
--
for
the
state
to
spread
the
cost
of
inspection
among
those
whom
it
inspects?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
outside
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
need
to
take
on
that
on
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
suggest
that
this
milk
does
not
need
the
health
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
say
that
milk
is
a
--
not
need
--
does
not
need
health
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
reciprocity
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
do
you
sure
--
who
do
you
sue
in
the
louisiana,
the
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
not
--
why
should
not
a
mississippi
producer
sue
the
louisiana,
he
has
the
same
constitutional
rights
to
free
flow
of
products
among
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
loui
--
if
loui
--
if
mississippi's
health
standards
and
the
product
--
and
the
production
of
milk
in
mississippi
are
comparable
to
louisianaâ€™s,
louisiana
probably
cannot
keep
them
out,
can
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
object
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
mr.
swagman
should
have
won
his
case
in
louisiana,
based
on
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
louisiana
must
under
the
constitution
accept
clean
milk
from
other
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
the
grounds
that
swagman
would
win
on,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
mississippi
is
subject
to
that
same
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
