mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
heber
ladner
jr.,
special
counsel
for
dr.
cottrell
in
this
matter.
section
11
of
our
regulation
is
a
part
of
the
solution
and
not
a
part
of
the
problem
to
the
interchange
of
milk
between
the
several
states.
in
the
first
place,
this
regulation
has
created
wide
ranging
commerce.
it
has
brought
in
milk
from
16
diaries
in
9
states.
it
has
worked,
in
short,
under
the
commerce
clause.
second,
unlike
the
baldwin
versus
seelig
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
this
regulation
does
not
favor
local
producers.
it
ensures
merely
parity
of
local
producers.
that
is
to
say,
the
reciprocity
provision
does
have
teeth,
but
it
allows
mississippi
producers
to
have
access
to
the
markets
from
which
imported
milk
comes.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
am
saying
that
once
a
certificate
of
reciprocity
is
not
forthcoming,
substantial
compliance
with
section
11
is
impossible
and
that
an
out-of-state
producer
is
then,
thrown
back
upon
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
we
do
say
that
it
fails
to
meet
health
standards.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
because
of
the
standards
applicable
to
domestic
producers.
absent
reciprocity
and
everything
section
11
entailed,
then
an
out-of-state
producer
is
thrown
back
upon
the
domestic
standards,
much
as
the
state
of
louisiana
says
it
utilizes
domestic
standards,
but
mississippi
did
--
does
not
at
present
conduct
out-of-state
inspections
because
it
adopted
section
11
to
obviate
that
responsibility.
in
other
words,
we
say
our
--
our
constitutional
responsibility
was
fulfilled
by
agreeing
to
let
out-of-state
milk
come
in
upon
a
reduced
standard
of
sanitation,
if
by
the
same
token
mississippi
milk
can
--
can
move.
now,
that
is
result
of
the
regulation.
the
methodology
of
the
regulation
is
to
simply
exchange
standards
of
inspection.
we
say
that
there
is
a
health-related
purpose
in
one
state
agreeing
that
a
sister
state
conducts
credible
health
investigations.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
your
honor,
on
this
record
i
would
think
not.
we
made
the
assertion
in
our
brief
and
the
trial
court
made
the
assertion
much
as
finding
the
fact
that
mississippi
standards
exceed
louisiana’s
and
i
find
that
unchallenged
in
the
appellant’s
brief.
we
say
that
we
--
the
regulation
serves
a
health-related
purpose
because
it
gains
out-of-state
assistance
in
inspecting
milk
and
it
ascertains
a
reasonably
reliable
interstate
standard.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
we
do,
but
we
say
that
we
--
we
are
not
isolating
ourselves,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
section
11
reciprocity
policy
has
worked,
is
produced.
we
are
in
a
strange
position
of
having
complied
with
the
--
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
and
in
the
same
breath
we
charge
with
--
with
not
complying
with
it.
we
have
used
one
of
those
reasonably
non-discriminatory
alternatives.
we
decided
we
did
not
want
make
out-of-state
inspections
and
so
instead
we
adopted
a
policy
of
reciprocity.
it
is
compulsory,
but
it
does
work.
now,
i
think
this
court's
cases
on
the
interstate
commerce
clause
focus
upon
the
whole
thrust
of
interstate
commerce
and
not
just
one
state
vis-à-vis
another.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
we
think
it
is
somewhat
broader
than
just
giving
louisiana
processors
the
right
to
come
in.
it
is
a
substantial,
but
incidental
burden
on
the
louisiana
processors
who
--
who
were
not
in
compliance
with
section
11,
but
we
think
the
interstate
commerce
clause
is
--
is
broader
than
just
mississippi
processors’
right
or
louisiana
processors’
right.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
we
say
to
that
the
sate
of
louisiana
has
the
power
to
execute
a
reciprocity
agreement.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
we
--
we
think
that
there
is
presently
some
litigation
in
louisiana
state
courts
that
has
come
up
since
this
case,
we
frankly
question
why
louisiana
was
not
sued
first?
why
us?
in
other
words,
there
is
a
duty
on
the
part
of
louisiana
official
to
enter
into
reciprocity
agreement.
it
is
in
the
original
record,
it
is
paragraph
5
b1
of
the
louisiana
regulations.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
the
sate
health
officer
for
failing
to
carry
out
his
duty
under
paragraph
5
b1.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
say
that
the
state
--
the
louisiana
regulation
reads
as
follows:
the
state
health
officer
…
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
am
on
page
8
of
my
brief.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
“the
state
health
officer
may
accept
the
certificate
of
inspection
of
a
duly
authorized
government
representative,
agent
or
agency
of
such
other
state,
wherein
such
products
are
produced.”
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
perhaps,
one
should,
one
has
not.
mr.
swagman,
a
well
known,
perhaps
nationally
known
--
i
think
mr.
swagman
helped
bust
the
fair
trade
law
several
years
ago
and
he
is
at
it
again
on
the
milk
regulations
and
he
has
obtained
an
injunction
in
the
louisiana
sate
court.
he
and
a
mississippi
producer
is
co-planing
it,
having
enjoined
the
louisiana
from
easing
to
accept
this
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
that
covet
rule
that
mississippi
milk
could
not
be
kept
out,
but
significantly
under
the
proviso
that
mississippi
milk
must
meet
louisiana
standards
to
come
in.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
result
of
this
case
of
section
11,
when
enjoined.
i
think
we
would
be
thrown
back
to
where
we
were
before.
there
has
been
no
challenge
in
this
case
that
our
health
regulations
for
domestic
producers
are
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
violate
the
commerce
clause
and
of
course,
there
might
be
some
question
as
to
how
far
section
11
falls
or
what
parts
of
it
fall,
but
we
would
say
it
would
be
a
sort
of
a
status
quo
situation
if
our
reciprocity
provisions
were
enjoined.
in
effect,
you
would
have,
almost
admittedly
you
would
have
a
&
p's
products,
which
do
not
meet
our
domestic
standards,
are
simply
up
against
our
domestic
standards,
so
section
11
is
productive.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
we
could,
we
could.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
could
not
speak
for
the
administrative
officials
i
represent,
but
that
possibility
could
be
confronted
later,
but
we
say
this
--
this
regulation
is
wiser
and
more
productive
for
interstate
commerce
through
all
of
the
sates,
than
having
these
picket
union
problems
of
how
many
square
feet
of
floor
space
is
in
the
milk
parlor
or
what
the
temperature
of
the
milk
is,
when
it
goes
to
the
cooling
trucks.
we
had
opted
this
regulation
to
try
to
avoid
those
hurdles
and
it
is
--
but
again,
to
get
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
inquiry
what
--
what
is
the
thrust
of
the
commerce
clause
in
a
case
of
this
import.
you
just
look
at
the
two
parties
or
that
you
look
at
all
commerce
coming
through
and
we
think
there
is
--
there
is
authority
in
--
in
this
court’s
books
in
polar
ice
cream
versus
andrew’s,
florida
case,
wherein
the
local
processors
were
required
to
buy
all
of
the
output
of
local
producers
at
a
certain
price
and
florida
came
to
this
court
and
argued
that
well,
in
effect
we
have
competition
on
the
distributor
level,
milk
comes
from
all
over.
this
court
in
the
footnote
analyzed
that
contingent
and
said,
well,
florida
of
all
the
southeastern
states
has
the
least
volume
of
interstate
movement
in
milk
at
the
distributor
level.
well,
we
have
a
high
volume.
proof
shows
that
this
regulation
has
produced
of
high
volume
of
interstate
trade
in
milk,
is
not
the
kind
of
historic
commerce
clause
case,
where
a
state
is
favoring
local
its
producers
or
its
local
economy.
all
this
regulation
does
is
obtain
the
imparity.
it
says
in
effect
mississippi
produced
milk
under
substantially
equivalent
regulations
can
go
wherever
milk
can
come
to
mississippi
from
and
that
is
--
and
that
is
the
result
under
section
11.
second,
i
will
explain
some
ways
in
which
this
reciprocity
regulation
is
health-related,
but
it
--
it
also
has
other
legitimate
state
interests
behind
it.
as
i
have
said
before
it
achieves
parity
for
local
producers
and
there
is
an
economic
justification
for
the
--
for
the
regulation
in
that
it
holds
down
the
price
of
milk.
regulation
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
this
court’s
cases
outlaw
only
favoritism,
but
not
parity.
there
is
an
aspect
in
which
mississippi
processors
are
--
are
disadvantaged,
under
our
section
11,
that
is
their
standard
for
sanitation
and
health
and
other
inspection
requirements
are
higher
than
those
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
results
in
increased
production
costs,
but
at
least
louisiana
would
be
bringing
in
milk
under
section
11,
if
the
state
complied
at
a
relaxed
standard.
now,
why
does
not
louisiana
comply?
we
think
it
is
relevant
to
this
case,
a
court
of
equity
look
at
all
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
including
the
fact
that
louisiana
stubbornly
refuses
to
enter
into
reciprocity
with
--
with
any
state.
they
have
the
power
to
do
so.
we
have
--
we
have
wondered
why
a
lawsuit
has
not
been
filed
against
the
state
of
louisiana
and
then
--
the
last
was
one,
while
this
case
was
brought
up
on
appeal.
the
regulation
of
health
and
sanitation
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
spoke
about
duties
earlier
and
i
was
--
i
was
leading
myself
several
steps
down
the
way.
they
have
a
discretionary
duty
under
this
statute
to
enter
into
reciprocity
agreements.
we
think
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
statute
is
there
for
no
good
purpose.
they
have
the
discretion.
they
cannot
exercise
the
discretion
capriciously
or
in
a
fashion
that
it
is
at
war
with
the
commerce
clause
and
we
say
they
are.
they
are
failing
to
accept
out-of-state
milk,
not
just
from
mississippi,
but
from
every
where.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that
as
much
as
that
concept
has
meaning,
they
are,
but
i
am
just
simply
saying
that
they
are
exceeding
the
bounds
of
their
discretion
in
not
considering
reciprocity
when
that
position
disadvantages
out-of-state
producers
for
commerce
clause
reasons.
they
are
acting
unconstitutionally,
acting
beyond
the
bounds
of
their
discretion
under
the
commerce
clause.
louisiana
has
the
trade
bearing
in
this
case
and
mississippi
has
the
solution,
yet
mississippi
is
sued
in
this
case
and
we
are
here
worrying
about
whether
a
regulation
in
effect
works
and
produces
the
widest
possible
scope
of
commerce.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
they
would
have
the
solution
if
louisiana
would
cooperate,
nine
other
states
have
and
we
seen
no
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
think
that
he
probably
should
have,
your
honor.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
with
the
distinction
that
louisiana
is
not
enjoying
a
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
milk
from
all
over
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
would.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
is
correct,
but
once
again,
he
won
a
peric
victory.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
i
will
take
it
the
interstate
commerce
clause
is
a
constitutional
reciprocity.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
that
was
their
position
and
the
court
said
that
--
the
state
court
in
louisiana
said
that
in
order
for
mississippi
milk
to
come
in.
it
must
meet
louisiana’s
health
requirements.
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct
nor
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
for
mississippi
to
exact
those
same
standards
from
louisiana,
absent
section
11,
so
a&p
could
win
the
battle
and
loose
the
war
if
it
just
succeeded
in
having
this
court
enjoin
section
11,
because
the
record
contains
indications
that
mississippi
standards
exceed
those
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
of
course
no
one
has
spoken
about
the
cost
of
out-of-state
inspections
necessary
to
verify
the
quality
of
louisiana
milk,
that
might
bring
about
a
price
differential,
in
its
own
way.
so
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
it
is
presently
having
milk
processed
by
mississippi
producers
under
its
own
label.
in
marketing
they
are
at
a
less
advantageous
profit
ratio
than
it
would
like.
i
have
a
hard
time
--
even
though
i
see
a
substantial
burden
with
respect
to
mississippi
bound
louisiana
commerce
in
this
case,
i
do
not
see
any
discrimination
of
constitutional
import.
there
is
certainly
no
intentional
discrimination
and
such
discrimination
as
result,
it
will
be
called
disparity
of
results
discrimination
is
produced
by
the
action
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
that
is
what
did
it
had
to
loose
by
signing
a
reciprocal
agreement
with
mississippi
that
was
valuable
or
that
could
be
reconciled
with
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
we
say
nothing.
now,
as
i
say,
once
this
baldwin
versus
seelig
line
of
cases
is
analyzed,
the
result
would
simply
be
that
we
are
not
favoring
domestic
commerce
with
respect
to
all
other
out-of-state
commerce.
now,
on
the
matter
to
conclude,
the
matter
of
the
equal
protection
claim;
jurisdictionally
we
say
it
is
not
here.
there
is
just
simply
been
no
amendment
to
the
complaint
to
reflect
a
practice
or
procedure
by
the
state
of
mississippi
in
allowing
grandfather
clause
access.
this
was
simply
an
after
thought
in
the
case.
the
counsel
for
a&p
at
one
point
determined
that
some
dairies
from
the
state
of
louisiana
were
coming
in,
so
he
decided
that
was
an
equal
protection
violation,
because
others
could
come
in,
but
he
could
not.
well,
how
is
a&p
to
be
advantaged
if
this
court
should
enjoin
mississippi
from
carrying
out
its
grandfather
policies?
in
effect,
that
would
just
disadvantage
a&p’s
competitors
without
helping
itself,
but
jurisdictionally
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
i
cite
golden
versus
zwickler
for
the
authority
that
as
a
standing
matter
you
do
not
have
standing
merely
to
disadvantage
your
competitors
if
you
cannot
obtain
any
beneficial
relief
yourself,
but
this
controversy
about
the
equal
protection
belongs
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
louisiana
makes
a
statement,
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
that
mississippi
has
adapted
this
grandfather
clause
policy
ultra
varies
without
any
statutory
authority.
well,
that
in
itself
implicitly
concedes
that
you
do
not
have
an
injunction
of
a
state
wide
import.
what
you
have
is
sort
of
a
quasi
declaratory
judgment.
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
the
controversy
is
just
simply
--
the
equal
protection
controversy
is
simply
not
here
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
that
was
a
matter
that
--
mr.
heber
a.
ladner,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
once
again
i
am
supposing
because
it
was
not
developed
in
the
record
in
this
case,
but
once
poses
that
when
section
11
was
adopted,
there
were
predecessor
regulations
of
some
sort,
under
which
these
companies
in
louisiana
qualified
and
i
had
never
--
i
do
not
get
the
constitutional
implications,
even
from
an
equal
protection
standpoint
of
the
grandfather
clause
treatment.
in
other
words,
there
were
rational
reasons
at
the
time
for
these
dairies
in
louisiana
to
come
in
and
at
the
time
section
11
was
adopted,
it
applied
only
looking
forward
and
not
backward.
now,
access
by
this
grandfather
clause
dairies
is
in
one
or
two
instances
that
i
know
of,
merely
local
access.
that
is
another
reason
why
the
regulations
allowing
grandfather
clause
treatment
on
a
state
wide
statute
of
state
wide
import.
in
other
words,
some
of
the
dairies
in
louisiana
had
access
to
merely
three
counties,
of
the
coastal
counties
in
the
state
of
mississippi
adjacent
to
new
orleans,
but
it
is
largely
undeveloped
on
this
record
and
we
say
it
is
merely
an
after
thought
that
its
--
jurisdictionally
is
not
proper
in
this
court
and
cannot
be
raised,
except
in
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
