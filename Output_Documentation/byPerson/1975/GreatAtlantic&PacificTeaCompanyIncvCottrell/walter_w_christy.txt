mr.
walter
w.
christy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
instant
case
presents
a
challenge
to
the
--
to
a
mississippi
statute
governing
the
sale
of
milk
in
mississippi
by
out-of-state
processors
and
brand
producers.
my
client,
the
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
operates
a
processing,
milk
processing
plant
in
the
state
of
louisiana
at
which
it
processes
milk
for
its
stores
in
louisiana
and
mississippi.
a
&
p
also
operates
approximately
38
stores
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
a
&
p
sought
a
permit
from
mississippi,
a
certification
from
mississippi
for
the
right
to
sell
its
milk
at
its
stores
in
mississippi.
the
permit
was
refused
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
in
question
requires
that
a
certificate
be
attached
to
the
application,
certifying
that
the
state,
in
this
case
louisiana,
would
give
reciprocity
to
mississippi’s
inspections
of
its
milk.
basically,
the
statute
says
your
honors
that
mississippi
will
allow
an
out-of-state
processor
to
sell
its
milk
in
mississippi,
if
that
company
--
if
the
state,
which
inspects
that
company’s
milk
has
standards
and
procedures
that
are
substantially
equivalent
to
those
of
mississippi
and
if
the
milk
receives
at
least
a
90%
rating
under
the
public
--
under
an
inspection
administered
by
a
public
health
service
certified
officer.
it
further
provides,
and
this
is
the
portion
of
the
statute
which
we
claim
to
be
unconstitutional,
that
the
milk
would
be
accepted
only
if
the
sending
state
gives
reciprocity
to
mississippi’s
inspections
and
accepts
its
standards,
also.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
well
your
honor,
just
section
11
is
the
--
is
the
only
section
that
deals
with
out-of-state
processors,
which
is
--
well,
in
answer
to
your
question,
only
section
11
and
only
part
of
section
11,
the
part
that
requires
that
the
processor
obtain
a
reciprocity
agreement
from
the
state
in
which
its
plant
is
located.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
it
is
a
very
confined
issue,
your
honors.
we
feel
that
the
statute
in
question
is
--
is
a
clearly
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
should
be
stricken
for
that
reason.
after
the
permit
was
denied,
a
&
p
filed
suit
in
mississippi
in
single
judge
court
and
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
this
was
denied.
the
company
was
given
leave
to
amend
and
ask
for
a
three-judge
court.
the
outcome
of
this
eventually
was
that
the
three-judge
court
denied
relief
and
this
appeal
followed.
your
honors,
mississippi
defends
its
statute
by
claiming
that
its
reciprocity
requirement
is
health-related
and
is
not
economic
in
nature
and
it
seeks
to
avoid
the
rulings,
the
vast
number
of
rulings
by
this
court
striking
down
similar
statutes
governing
regulation
of
milk,
sale
of
milk,
in
which
economic
purposes
were
found.
we
feel
that
logic
shows
that
the
statue,
or
at
least
the
reciprocity
provision
can
only
be
economic
in
nature.
mississippi
says,
“well,
if
we
get
reciprocity
from
louisiana,
then
we
will
accept
their
milk
even
though
their
standards
are
lower,
if
they
will
accept
our
milk.”
well,
if
they
accept
it
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
there
is
no
question
in
this
case.
it
has
been
stipulated
that
but
for
the
reciprocity
agreement,
a
&
p's
milk
would
be
acceptable
and
that
louisiana
standards
are
substantially
equivalent
to
mississippi’s.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
no
sir,
only
the
reciprocity
provision.
my
point
i
was
making
was
that
the
reciprocity
has
nothing
to
do
with
wholesomeness,
because
if
--
if
the
reciprocity
statement
is
signed
and
submitted
then
a
permit
is
given
and
they
will
accept
milk
of
a
less
wholesome
nature.
now,
their
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
i
suggest
your
honor
that
the
statue
in
question
is
--
is
an
economic
measure
passed
by
mississippi
to
ensure
that
its
processors
have
an
available
market
before
it
lets
in
foreign
competition.
also,
i
think
the
record
reflects
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
was
so
that
mississippi
would
not
have
to
expend
the
cost
of
--
for
out-of-sate
inspections.
mr.
cottrell,
the
defendant
testified
to
that
effect.
further,
along
this
line,
your
honors
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
that
was
the
basis
--
well,
i
do
not
think
that
question
is
before
the
court.
i
realize
that
that
could
be
--
it
could
be
an
alternative
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
i
was
going
to
point
your
honor
that
the
dixie
dairy
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
the
dixie
dairy
case,
which
is
cited
by
mississippi
and
was
also
relied
on
by
the
three-judge
court
to
deny
the
relief,
this
was
a
three-judge
court
in
the
seventh
circuit,
which
held
that
the
city
of
chicago
had
the
right
to
require
out-of-state
inspections
of
indiana
milk
and
that
this
was
not
a
burden.
well
you
honors,
the
--
that
case
was
overruled
by
the
seventh
circuit
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
has
since
ruled
that
chicago’s
requirement
of
its
own
inspections
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
as
much
as
indiana’s
inspections
are
sufficient
to
ensure
wholesome
milk.
so,
what
i
am
saying
is
if
that
is,
and
that
is
now
before
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
i
do
not
believe
that
this
case
requires
that.
i
think
that
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
in
the
area
of
milk,
regulation
of
milk
by
the
states,
make
clear
that
a
--
a
state
cannot
interact
an
economic
barrier
against
foreign
competition,
in
consequence
of
its
own
local
producers.
furthermore,
if
--
if
--
and
we
recognize
that
milk
in
these
cases,
have
recognized
that
the
regulation
of
milk
is
not
the
state’s
interest
and
it
is
a
matter
of
local
concern,
but
if
there
are
--
if
there
is
a
regulation
that
burdens
commerce
and
there
are
alternative
means
available,
which
will
be
less
of
a
burden,
then
the
regulation
must
fall.
the
dean’s
milk
case
mentioned
that.
there
is
no
question
here
that
if
the
reciprocity
requirement
is
not
economically
related
--
is
not
related
to
the
health,
then
they
do
not
need
it,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
reason
for
it.
the
statute
could
stand
without
that
requirement
and
mississippi
would
get
just
as
wholesome
milk
as
it
would
with
it
and
along
these
lines
the
--
the
record
reflects
that
four
dairies
in
the
louisiana,
four
processors
in
louisiana
are
at
this
time
and
have
been
exporting
milk
to
mississippi
without
a
reciprocity
agreement.
now,
mississippi
has
been
unable
to
explain
why
they
allow
four
processors
to
do
this,
but
they
would
not
allow
a
&
p
to
do
it
and
this
goes
to
the
second
part
of
our
argument,
that
bearing
on
the
equal
protection
claim,
but
i
think
it
illustrates
also
that
the
reciprocity
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
wholesomeness
of
milk.
your
honor,
mississippi
also
claims
that
their
statute
survives
a
constitutional
attack
because
they
have
--
they
have
safety
valves
built
in
there.
the
safety
valve
they
claim
is
that
their
--
the
statute
provides
that
the
--
the
governing
authority
can
inspect
the
milk
and
see
if
meets
domestic
standards.
so
that
if
we
do
not
have
a
reciprocity
agreement,
we
can
still
get
into
mississippi
with
our
milk
by
meeting
their
domestic
standards,
but
--
and
a
footnote
in
their
brief,
they
admit
that
they
have
no
means
set-up
for
any
type
of
inspection
at
all.
so,
we
submit
that
if
the
statute
does
allow
for
--
for
my
client
to
get
in
with
an
out-of-state
inspection,
it
is
being
applied
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
because
no
basis
or
no
--
no
procedures
has
been
established
to
--
to
allow
this.
mississippi's,
i
think
the
brief
indicates
that
the
main
thrust
of
their
argument
is
that
mississippi
is
not
to
blame,
but
louisiana
is
to
blame.
do
not
--
do
not
come
to
us
and
ask
to
get
your
milk
in.
go
to
louisiana
and
make
them
give
you
a
reciprocity
agreement.
well,
your
honors,
a
&
p
is
not
louisiana.
we
cannot
force
louisiana
to
enact
legislation.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
it
is
a
statement,
when
--
when
you
apply
for
a
certification,
the
health
officer
from
mississippi
sends
you
a
form
stating
the
requirements.
one
of
the
requirements
is
a
form
attached
to
that,
which
has
a
place
to
fill
in
the
name
of
the
other
state's
governing
authority,
health
authority
and
they
have
to
sign
it,
stating
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
that
authority
has
to
sign
it
and
of
course
louisiana
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
there
has
been
none
and
louisiana’s
position
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
no
sir.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
yes
sir.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
and
this
we
have
been
able
to
do,
but
louisiana's
position
is,
we
do
not
--
we
are
not
going
to
sign
a
reciprocity
agreement.
we
will
let
any
body’s
milk
come
into
our
state
if
it
meets
our
standards
and
louisiana
does
conduct
out-of-state
inspections.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
no
sir.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
there
is,
i
believe
the
--
the
regulations
under
which
louisiana
operates,
give
the
--
give
the
authorities,
the
discretion
to
enter
into
a
reciprocity
agreement
if
they
want
to,
but
they
have
never
done
this.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
the
record
contains
copies
of
all
the
--
the
various
statutes
and
regulations,
but
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
explanation
of
why
they
have
never
entered
into
it.
we
have
--
well
your
honors,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
letter
from
the
chief
health
officer
in
the
louisiana,
explaining
the
position
of
louisiana
and
that
is
basically
what
i
said
that
we
do
not
believe
reciprocity
is
necessary,
we
let
any
body’s
milk
come
in
if
it
meets
our
standards
and
that
--
that
has
been
their
position
and
that
is
as
far
as
they
would
go,
but
mississippi
would
not
accept
this
and
refuses
to
issue
the
permit.
as
i
mentioned,
we
believe,
although
our
principal
argument
is
aimed
at
the
commerce
clause
question
that
the
record
reflects
that
a
&
p
has
been
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mississippi
responses
to
this
by
saying,
“well,
you
have
never
brought
out
the
regulations
under
which
these
four
dairies
were
allowed
to
continue
to
do
business
in
--
in
mississippi
without
reciprocity.”
i
believe
the
record
shows
the
only
regulation
in
effect
is
section
11
and
if
mississippi
applies
section
11
by
allowing
four
processors
to
do
business
without
reciprocity,
while
not
allowing
a
&
p
to
do
business
without
a
reciprocity,
then
i
believe
that
is
a
clear
denial
of
equal
protection
as
the
statute
is
applied.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
that
is
what
i
understand
--
mr.
walter
w.
christy
and
--
and
the
state
and
the
claim
is
made
that
we
should
have
attacked
the
grandfather
provision.
well,
frankly
nobody
seems
know
--
nobody
knows
about
any
grand
--
the
record
does
not
contain
or
mention
of
any
provision
as
been
none
brought
into
any
body’s
attention
and
--
and
frankly
i
do
not
know
of
what
grandfather
provision
counsel
is
referring
to.
i
do
not
believe
the
counsel
does.
we
are
talking
about
section
11
and
if
there
is
sec
--
another
law
that
says
these
dairies
can
come
in
without
complying
with
the
law,
it
was
never
brought
to
any
body’s
attention.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
yes,
that
is
correct.
they
--
they
were
doing
business
before
1967
and
a
&
p
began
operations
about
1972.
i
might
add
that
a
&
p
is
sustaining
a
considerable
loss
of
revenue
as
a
result
of
mississippi’s
recalcitrance
of
adjusting
the
cost
of
buying
milk
in
mississippi
for
it
stores,
as
opposed
to
the
price,
the
cost
that
it
could
process
the
milk
for
itself
have
been
estimated
approximately
$195,000
a
year
and
of
course,
this
is
not
the
only
damage
they
are
suffering.
i
would
like
to
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
w.
christy
just
briefly,
your
honor.
as
to
the
last
matter
raised,
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
the
information
as
to
the
four
other
dairies
--
processors
came
out
during
the
testimony
at
the
initial
hearing.
a&p
had
no
prior
knowledge
of
this.
the
matter
or
the
issue
as
to
equal
protection
was
raised
before
the
three-judge
court.
it
was
briefed
by
the
parties
and
the
three-judge
court,
specifically
ruled
on
the
issue.
it
is
in
their
opinion.
they
reasoned
that
they
could
not
enjoin
mississippi
in
that
practice
because
if
they
did,
it
might
prevent
mississippi
from
later
requiring
reciprocity
from
the
full
processors.
i
do
not
exactly
understand
the
reasoning,
but
they
did
rule
on
it.
i
would
just
like
to
make
a
final
point.
counsel
perhaps
inadvertently,
i
am
sure
it
was
inadvertently,
but
he
made
the
statement
--
louisiana
makes
a
statement,
in
his
jurisdictional
statement,
we
are
no
louisiana,
we
are
a&p
and
i
think
the
whole
case,
as
far
as
the
defendant,
appellee
is
concerned
is
that
we
are
to
be
treated
as
though
we
are
louisiana.
we
are
simply
a
processor
in
louisiana
trying
to
sell
our
milk
in
mississippi
and
we
feel
the
barriers
erected
by
mississippi
to
doing
this
are
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
they
should
be
stricken
and
we
should
be
allowed
a
means
of
bringing
our
milk
in.
this
is
what
the
constitution
requires
and
it
is
not
sufficient,
i
submit
to
say,
“well,
we
are
the
good
guys.
we
have
the
reciprocity
and
that
is
all
we
have
to
do.
”that
is
not
all
he
has
to
do
and
i
submit
that
although
their
goals
maybe
laudable,
the
effect
of
the
law
is
to
lock
us
out
and
we
submit
that
the
law
should
be
stricken.
thank
you.
