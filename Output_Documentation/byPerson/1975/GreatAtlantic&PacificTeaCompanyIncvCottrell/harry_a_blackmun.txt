justice
blackmun
i
think
the
rest
of
it
is
not
for,
it
said
it
is
(voice
overlapping)
even
in
the
record
or
in
your
brief
of
anything.
it
is
just
section
11?
justice
blackmun
is
it
possible
that
louisiana
standards
maybe
higher
than
mississippiâ€™s,
is
it
not?
justice
blackmun
how
do
you
work
out
this
duty
on
the
part
of
louisiana
to
reciprocate?
justice
blackmun
mr.
ladner,
what
would
be
the
basis
of
that
lawsuit?
why
does
louisiana
have
a
duty
to
reciprocate?
justice
blackmun
well,
are
not
they
a
sovereign
state?
justice
blackmun
well,
is
that
the
point,
to
put
them
all
in
an
equal
basis?
justice
blackmun
can
you
explain
why
mississippi
permits
the
grandfather
operation?
justice
blackmun
are
the
reasons
just
as
applicable
to
those
other
producers
as
they
are
to
a&p?
