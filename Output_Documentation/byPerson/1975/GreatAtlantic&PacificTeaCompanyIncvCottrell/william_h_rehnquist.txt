justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
is
the
position
mississippi
here
so
much
different
than
that
of
the
city
of
madison
in
the
dean
milk
case?
there
are
two
madisons
that
were
not
just
not
going
to
make
out-of-state
inspections.
now,
you
have
an
addition
to
that
policy,
a
reciprocity
provision,
but
you
pretty
well
have
to
defend
the
reciprocity
provision,
do
not
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
--
but
is
the
only
goal
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause
to
make
sure
that
mississippi
has
enough
milk
coming
into
suit
its
needs
or
is
it
not
also
to
give
the
louisiana
producers
a
right
to
send
milk
into
the
mississippi
if
there
are
no
health
objections
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
--
it
is
not
just
a
minor
burden
on
them.
they
simply
cannot
do
anything
as
i
understand,
louisiana
processors
that
want
to
ship
milk
in
the
mississippi?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
your
--
as
your
opponent
points
out
a
&
p
is
not
the
state
of
louisiana?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
turn
--
you
could
turn
them
down
on
the
basis
of
their
failure
to
meet
your
domestic
standards
then,
could
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
louisianaâ€™s
position
is
that
the
milk
approved
by
mississippi
inspectors
is
just
not
sufficiently
healthy
compared
to
what
we
demand
in
louisiana,
therefore,
we
are
not
going
to
let
it
in?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that
is
certainly
not
a
violation
to
the
commerce
clause,
is
it?
