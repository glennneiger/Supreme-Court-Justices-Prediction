mr.
dunklin
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
assistant
attorney
general
from
texas
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
w.j.
estelle,
the
director
of
the
texas
department
of
corrections.
we
are
here
on
this
case
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
a
defendant’s
trial
in
jail
clothing
is
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
it
destroys
his
presumption
of
innocence
and
therefore
denies
him
a
fair
trial.
the
respondent
in
this
case
harry
lee
williams
was
convicted
by
a
jury
of
assault
with
intent
to
murder
with
malice
in
november
of
1970
in
houston
and
was
assessed
by
the
trial
judge,
his
punishment
confinement
for
ten
years
in
the
texas
department
of
corrections.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
affirmed
this
conviction
on
direct
appeal.
the
federal
district
court
below
then
held
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
case
and
denied
the
respondent
relief
holding
that
while
trial
in
jail
clothing
was
inherently
prejudicial.
the
evidence
of
his
guilt
was
so
overwhelming.
the
trial
in
jail
clothing
was
harmless
error.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
this
holding
and
affirming
again
that
trial
in
jail
clothe
is
inherently
prejudicial
but
they
found
that
harmless
error
was
not
available
in
this
particular
--
the
state
of
circumstances.
and
although
the
fifth
circuit
had
held
in
the
hernandez
case
1971
for
the
first
time
specifically
stating
that
trial
in
jail
clothing
was
inherently
prejudicial.
in
the
williams
case
they
held
for
the
first
time
that
the
decision
was
to
be
given
retroactive
application.
our
contention
is
that
the
united
states
constitution
while
it
guarantees
a
fair
trial
does
not
guarantee
a
perfect
trial.
and
we
contend
that
trying
a
man
in
jail
clothing
is
not
so
fundamentally
unfair
to
destroy
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
deny
a
man
a
fair
trial.
a
juror
is
aware
or
most
jurors
are,
that
defendants
are
arrested
and
there
are
kept
in
the
jail
prior
to
trial.
and
when
a
defendant
is
brought
into
the
court
room
in
jail
clothing
that
the
jurors
are
not
so
surprised
or
shocked.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
well,
i
mean
the
ones
that
are
not
able
to
be
released
on
a
bail
would
be
brought
in
in
jail
clothes.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
they
have
to
wear
the
jail
clothes.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
no
your
honor.
they
were
not
striped,
most
of
the
ones
were,
i
cannot
describe
--
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
it
was
a
white
t-shirt
and
harris
county
jail
stencil
across
the
back
and
pair
of
pants
with
the
harris
county
jail,
maybe
stencil
down,
one
side
of
the
pants.
no
striped
clothes.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
thank
you
your
honor.
i
believe
the
last
thing
we
talked
about
was
judge
blackmun
had
asked
the
attire
of
the
defendants
who
were
brought
into
the
court
room
and
i
would
like
to
say
that
they
did
not
have
on,
the
striped
uniform
with
the
little
striped
head.
it
was
a
pair
of
white
coveralls
and
most
cases
with
harris
county
jail
stenciled
across
at
the
back
of
the
uniform
and
sometimes
down
at
the
leg
of
one
of
the
pair
of
the
trousers
they
had
on.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
were
none
of
these
defendants
as
far
as
i
can
determine
that
were
compelled
to
go
to
trial
in
the
jail
clothes
they
had
on.
the
reason
they
were
tried
was
because
the
attorney
raised
no
objection
to
the
trial
judge
asking
that
they
be
tried
in
the
any
other
type
of
clothing
and
the
clothes
they
had
on.
and
it
is
our
position
that
being
tried
in
jail
clothing
is
not
anymore
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
and
then
bring
to
the
jury
of
the
indictment
or
under
--
or
agreeing
to
the
jury
of
prior
convictions
alleged
in
the
indictment
for
enhancement
of
the
state,
habitual
criminal
statutes.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
no
sir,
he
did
not.
however,
the
prosecuting
attorney
on
the
board
of
the
whole
jury
panel
did,
so
to
speak
asked
and
the
jurors
if
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
in
jail
clothing
would
have
any
kind
of
effect
on.
and
none
of
the
jurors
posed
an
objection
and
the
defense
attorney
did
the
same
thing.
he
said
the
fact
that
this
man
sitting
over
here
with
the
jail
clothes
on,
do
they
have
any
effect
on
and
again
none
of
the
jurors
expressed
otherwise.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir,
he
says
that
he
did
in
the
federal
habeas
hearing.
he
said
he
had
the
clothes
on
when
he
was
arrested
and
that
he
had
asked
somebody
at
the
rehabilitation
center
told
him
that
he
wanted
to
have
these
clothe
when
he
went
to
state
court
trial.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
no
sir.
it
really
is,
to
be
honest.
i
just
do
not
think
that
it
makes
that
much
of
an
impression.
and
we
have
both
sides
and
testimony
here
from
the
jurors
in
the
federal
habeas
hearing
and
i
wish
they
have
responded
that
they
really
did
not
remember
what
type
of
clothing,
the
defendant
had
on.
and
it
just
did
not
make
that
much
of
an
impression
on.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
that
is
exactly
correct
and
of
course
in
this
case,
you
could
almost
say
that
the
defensive
counsel,
all
he
asked
the
perspective
of
jurors
as
if
the
bail
is
okay
with
them
as
if
it
would
not
harm
them
in
any
way.
he
can
send
it
to
have
this
man
tried
in
these
prison
clothes.
and
there
is
a
fifth
circuit
case
where
the
defense
attorney
did
testify
that
he
wanted
this
man
tried
in
jail
garb
because
he
thought
he
would
make
a
sympathetic
impression
on
the
jury.
so
--
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir,
that
is
true.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
if
you
can
get
an
attorney
to
testify
that
he
wants
his
man
tried
in
jail
clothes
because
he
thought
it
would
make
the
jury
be
in
sympathy
and
that
there
is
an
exception.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
and
that
is
the
thing
that
bothers
me
about
the
fifth
circuit
holding
in
this
case
like
now,
in
the
hernandez
case
and
we
thought
our
motion
for
rehearing
that
say
it
that
the
defendant
has
got
to
make
an
objection.
he
is
got
to
make
the
trial
judge
aware
that
he
did
not
want
to
be
tried
in
jail
clothes.
and
then
they
started
sort
of
under
cutting
that
decision
and
now
they
say,
well
in
harris
county
everybody
was
tried
in
jail
clothes
and
so
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
did
not
object
is
not
waiver
that
right
because
the
lawyers
testified,
a
lot
of
them
did.
they
did
not
think
they
are
being
used
and
objected
because
everybody
was
being
tried
and
the
objection
would
be
denied.
it
would
not
be
substantial
objection.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
i
think
under,
that
would
the
best
thing
as
far
as
--
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
under
my
view
then
i
think
that
he
has
to
show
that
he
was
harmed,
substantially
harmed
by
being
tried.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
no
sir,
unless
he
was
able
to
specifically
show
harm.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
to
the
trial
judge
because
in
habeas
hearings
of
course
the
petitioner
will
say,
i
asked
somebody
from
the
rehabilitation
center
and
to
hold
over
time
and
of
course
he
cannot
remember
who
it
was
and
it
is
pretty
hard
to
find
out
who
he
was
talking
about,
it
puts
the
state
in
a
hard
position
to
rebut
his
testimony.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
your
honor.
that
is
my
position
that
it
should
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
in
fact
in
this
very
case
here
we
have
a
certificate
from
the
trial
judge
and
he
stated
that
if
he
had
been
asked
or
requested
for
williams
to
be
tried
in
civilian
clothes
he
would
have
allowed
but
their
request
and—
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
well
your
honor,
i
think
in
one
of
the
tenth
circuit
cases,
they
proved
he
was
harmed
when
the
prosecutor
kept
referring
to
him
as
manson
over
here
with
the
jail
clothes
on
he
was
just
like
all
the
rest
of
them.
and
they
seemed
to
infer
from
that
the
jury
might—
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
well,
perhaps
by
the
length
of
the
term
of
sentence,
he
got.
there
was
an
oklahoma
case
where
the
maximum
punishment
was
seven
years
and
the
man
objected
was
tried
in
jail
clothes;
he
got
a
five
year
sentence.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
but
in
this
particular
case
the
trial
judge
assessed
it.
in
the
williams
case
the
defendant
has
the
choice
either
the
jury
can
asses
the
punishment
or
else
the
trial
judge
can.
in
this
case
he
elected
to
have
a
trial
judge
asses
punishment.
the
trial
judge
assessed
him
ten
years,
the
maximum
was
25
years.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
and,
well
your
honor
we
have
not
tried
him
since
the
hernandez
decision
in
'71.
up
until
that
time
the
only
reason
i
have
is
that
that
just
never
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
inherently
unfair.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
and
the
harris
county
and
some
other
counties
had
a
large
number
of
defendants.
i
suppose
because
allowed
the
defense
when
they
were
arrested,
maybe
their
clothes
they
had
on
were,
that
they
did
not
think
that
it
might
make
a
very
good
impression
and
they
thought
perhaps
they
would
look
better
the
jury
and
coveralls
that
was
starched
and
it
and
--
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
no
sir.
our
main
interest
is
just
to
keep
it
from
being
applied
retroactive.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
right.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
the
william's
case
was
tried
in
1970.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
no
sir.
hernandez
did
not
say
if
it
was
retro—
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
no
sir.
hernandez
was
the
first
case.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
of
retroactivity?
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes.
that
is
what
they
say
in
the
williams
case,
they
say,
you
know
we
hold
that
now
it
is
going
to
be
applied
retroactive.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
of
course
our
concern
is,
is
if
it
is
given
retroactive
application
we
have
got,
you
know
all
the
people
in
the
penitentiary
that
were
convicted
on
the
recite
of
this
statutes.
if
they
can
just
allege
and
knock
out
one
prior
conviction
because
of
being
tried
in
jail
clothes
they
would
be
entitled
to
be
released.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
because
the
fifth
circuit
held
it
was.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
i
suppose
so
because
the—
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
that
is
in
the
brooks
case
you
are
talking—
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes.
they
had
said.
of
course,
the
brook's
case
was
disposed
of
mainly
because
of
ineffective
assistance
of
an
attorney
in
that
case.
and
they
did
say
that
trial
in
prison
garb
is
inherently
unfair
but
that
was
just
at
the
conclusion
out
of
of
a
lot
of
other
things
that
the
attorney
did
not
do.
in
fact
there
was
a
federal
judge
in
houston
that
in
1970
some
three
years
after
the
brooks
decision,
they
decided
that
the
brook's
decision
really
did
not
stand
for
that
proposition.
and
he
said,
it
was
alright
to
try
a
defendant
in
jail
clothing,
it
was
not
inherently
un-prejudicial.
so
--
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir,
i
suppose.
of
course
it,
in
the
hernandez
case,
the
defense
attorney
made
no
objection
either.
he
testified
the
federal
habeas
hearing
that
he
did
not
object
because
he
felt
that
it
would
be
that
everybody
was
being
tried
and
that
he
thought
it
would
be
a
useless
objection
and
when
hernandez
went
up
on
appeal,
fifth
circuit
reversed
that
saying
that
for
the
first
time,
actually
that
trial
in
prison
clothes
is
inherently
prejudicial.
and—
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
except,
of
course
specifically
holding
it
was
retroactive.
because
we
had
argued
before
that
he
was
not
and
there
was
another
fifth
circuit
case,
goodspeed
i
believe
in
which,
if
one
judge
said
he
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
applied
retroactively
but
the
other
two
said,
but
we
are
presenting
with
that
chip,
we
are
not
going
to
make
that
determination.
but
in
the
williams
case,
they
definitely
said
it
was
retroactive.
so
--
and
of
course,
it
is
for
this
reason
that
although
we
do
not
think
it
is
inherently
prejudicial
we
have
not
tried
anybody
in
jail
clothes
since
hernandez
in
'71
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
the
williams
case
should
not
be
applied
retrospectively.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
in
71,
1971.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
so
that
is
true,
but
of
course
i
recognize
there
is
a
possibility
of
unfairness
here
and-
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
and
you
are
trying
to
be
fair
to
the
defendant
of
the
state.
i
suppose
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
a
defendant
might
suffer
some
collateral
effects.
so
if
this
court
would
hold
it,
you
know,
do
not
do
it
anymore.
well,
we
would
have
no
real
quarrel
of
that
but
especially
not
to
hold
it
retroactive.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
and
there
is
a
case
on
the
books
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
another
trial
judge
had
did
the
same
thing.
the
defendant
did
not
have
any
clothes
to
wear,
his
attorney
objected
and
the
judge
went
back
and
handed
also
the
clothes
(inaudible).
the
final
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is
to
why
i
do
not
particularly
feel
it
is
inherently
prejudicial,
that
there
is
some
really
finding
in
the
attorney
general
harris
county
bar
association.
there
was
never,
there
were
very
few
objections
made
by
any
of
those
lawyers
to
defendants
being
tried
in
these
jail
clothing.
and
i
argued
that
the
reason
they
did
not
object
was
because
they
just
attached
no
significance
to
them.
they
just
did
not
think
it
made
that
much
of
a
difference.
and
it
is
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
an
attorney
who
really
thinks
that
his
client
is
going
to
be
denied
a
fair
trial
by
being
tried
in
jail
clothes,
would
you
stand
by
and
not
make
an
objection
because
he
thought
it
would
be
denied
because,
of
course,
you
never
know
until
you
make
an
objection
it
would
be
denied
or
not.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
at
one
time
they
did
not.
i
do
not
know
exactly
the
year
they
started
to
wear
in
robes.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
yes
sir.
they
are
provided.
i
think
the
only
way
you
can
get
tried
in
jail
clothes,
now
if
you
say,
i
want
to
be
tried
in
jail
clothes.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
since
1971.
mr.
dunklin
sullivan
i
think
throughout
the
state,
your
honor.
that
is
--
since
hernandez
has
come
down,
we
do
