unknown
speaker
do
you
have
bail
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
comes
to
ask
and
stand
in
jail,
is
that
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
sullivan
what
kind
of
jail
clothes
were
they?
are
they
all
striped--
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sullivan
did
judge
love
give
any
instructions
about
prison
garb
to
the
jury
at
all?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
mr.
williams
had
any
personal
clothes
that
were
taken
from
him
at
the
time
of
his
incarceration?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
personal
clothes
might
be
more
offensive
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
than
prison
garb
might
be.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
courts
below
commented
that
it
was
the
preference
of
some
defense
attorneys
to
have
their
clients
tried
in
prison
clothes
to
give
the
impression
that
he
had
already
served
some
time,
so
why
give
him
a
lot
more
than
that?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it
the
fifth
circuit
has
explicitly
cut
out
an
exception
from
their
so-called
per
se
rule
for
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
after
this
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
any
case
where
there
was
not
a
request
that
he
would
be
tried
in
civilian
clothes
and
there
he
would
assume
that
he
and
his
counsel
were
satisfied.
they
are
even
preferred
that
he
would
be
tried
in
jail
attires,
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
what
is
your
position
that
if
the
defendant
asks
to
be
tried
in
civilian
clothes
that
he
is
entitled
to
it.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
not
have
a
per
se
rule
even
in
that
situation.
you
would
not
resume
any
harm?
unknown
speaker
when
you
answered
justice
white’s
question
about
a
request
to
be
tried
in
street
clothes.
do
you
mean
a
request
to
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
he
is
perfectly
accurate
in
his
testimony,
i
suppose
asking
somebody
at
the
rehabilitation
center
isn’t
the
same
thing
as
calling
it
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
who
is
responsible
for
conducting
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sullivan,
how
was
the
prisoner
--
he
was
harmed
by
being
tried
in
the
prison
garb?
unknown
speaker
well
that
sounds
to
me
like
prosecutorial
misconduct.
how
otherwise
does
he
prove
it?
if
no
one
says
anything
about
it
and
there
he
sits
and
he
is
convicted.
how
do
we
know
what
the
jury
asserted
this?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
jury
sentencing
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
in
your
state,
the
jury
sentence
that
does
it?
in
your
state,
texas,
the
jury
imposes
or
fixes
the
sentences,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sullivan
why
does
texas
tried
him
in
jury
clothes?
unknown
speaker
it
used
to
be
the
fashion
to
do
it
this
way.
unknown
speaker
well
your
honor,
really
i
do
not
think,
like
i
said,
it
was,
that
the
state,
you
do
not
have
much
i
has
formed
the
impression
one
way
or
another.
that
they
just
assumed
that
it
was
okay
unless
the
defendant
raised
an
objection
to
it.
now,
if
he
objects
it,
the
trial
judge
and
they
would
allow
him
to
get
some
civilian
clothing
from
somewhere.
if
he
did
not
object
they
assumed
it
was
okay.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
or
it
is
the
part
of
the
state's
interest
to
prevent
this
decision
from
being
applied
to
everyone
who
has
ever
been
tried
in
texas
and
who
is
still
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
was
this
tried?
unknown
speaker
1970?
unknown
speaker
and
this
was
applied
retroactively
then
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
this
what
you
mean,
it
was
applied
retroactively
in
the
sense
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
already
decided
the
case,
hernandez?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
was
this
the
first
case
that—
unknown
speaker
well,
was
this
the
first
case
that
announced
this
particular
rule?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
this
is
a
retroactivity
case,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
everyone
that
has
never
been
tried
is
still
in
jail.
unknown
speaker
why
do
say
williams
is
being
applied
retroactively?
unknown
speaker
right.
that
maybe
what
the
fifth
circuit
said.
but
in
this
case,
is
it
applied
retroactively?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
this
the
first
case
that
ever
announced
this
particular
rule?
mr.
sullivan,
the
fifth
circuit
in
brooks
against
texas
as
i
recall,
said
trial
in
prison
garb
is
inherently
unfair.
that
is
in
1967.
unknown
speaker
hernandez
was
in
1971
and
the
trial
of
williams
was
in
1970.
so
that
in
1970,
ca5
by
dictum
that
held
or
had
said
that
trial
in
prison
garb
is
inherently
unfair,
that
is
a
sequence
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
was
the
first
case
that
said
that
conviction
in
prison
clothes
cannot
be
upheld
even
though
the
defendant
did
not
request
being
tried
in
civilian
clothes.
unknown
speaker
so
what,
in
this
case
williams
did
not
go
any
farther
than
prior
cases
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
not
any
trial
before
hernandez
and
hernandez
was
decided
when?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlapped)
any
trials
before
1971?
unknown
speaker
you
also
asked
us
to
hold
that
it
is
not
constitutionally
affirmed
that
he
did
try
a
person
in
prison
garb,
right?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
this
the
trial
judge
who,
when
some
prisoner
objected
allowing
them,
the
judge
allow
(ph)
them
the
suit
of
his
own
clothes.
unknown
speaker
they
tried
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
in
texas,
do
state
judges
wear
robes?
unknown
speaker
did
they
in
1970?
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
not
do
you
think
it
would
made
a
difference
in
the
fairness
of
the
trial?
at
one
time
they
did
not,
am
i
not
correct
on
that?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
the
texas
or
at
least
harris
country
changed
its
way
of
doing
things
after
the
hernandez
decision
in
1971?
unknown
speaker
so
now,
since
1971
even
without
a
request
from
the
defendant
civilian
clothes
are
provided?
unknown
speaker
and
that
has
been
true
since
1971?
unknown
speaker
since
the
hernandez
decision,
is
that
true
throughout
texas
or
only
in
harris
county?
unknown
speaker
and
before
hernandez
was
this
problem
peculiar
to
harris
county
or
was
it
general
throughout
texas?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mostly
from?
unknown
speaker
houston
is
harris
county
and—
unknown
speaker
that
has
been
changed
throughout
the
state
since
1971.
unknown
speaker
now
routinely,
defendants
are
tried
in
civilian
clothes,
the
only
way
they
would
be
tried
in
jail
clothes
would
be
if
they
made
an
affirmative
request.
unknown
speaker
in
what?
unknown
speaker
would
you
mind
stating
what
is
that
called?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
suggest
he
was
compelled
to
do
it
here,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
made
no
objection
here.
unknown
speaker
well
are
you
--
now
are
you
arguing
in
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
whether
a
trial
judge
is
suppose
to
read
through
all
those
by
himself
without
ever
having
called
to
his
attention
by
defense
council?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
is
the
state
simply
--
is
the
state
one
entity
in
this
sense
that
if
you
make
a
complaint
to
a
captain
in
the
sheriff’s
office
some
miles
away
from
the
court
house,
it
is
the
same
as
having
protested
to
the
judge
to
whom
the
state
has
entrusted
responsibility
for
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
what
decisions
are
you
talking
about
the
decisions
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
why
should
an
objection
not
be
required
here
where,
whatever
maybe
the
case
with
perhaps
more
fundamental
rights,
if
this
is
a
constitutional
right,
if
some
lawyers
like
to
have
their
clients
tried
in
jail
garb,
as
the
record
here
indicates
and
others
apparently
feel
it
is
prejudicial,
why
should
we
not
at
least
require
that
someone
who
does
not
want
to
be
tried
that
way
have
called
the
objection,
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
and
now
you
say
–
you
say
chilled.
i
certainly,
in
16
years
of
practice
i
would
not
only
make
an
objection
before
different
trial
judge,
i
would
make
the
same
objection
time
and
again
before
the
same
trial
judge.
and
i
never
felt
he
was
going
to
cut
my
head
off
if
i
did
it,
so
long
as
i
was
courteous
and
respectful.
to
say
that
you
have
made
an
objection
before
another
trial
judge
and
it
was
denied
does
not
strike
me
as
any
reason
at
all
why
you
should
not
make
an
objection
before
this
trial
judge.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
judge
love’s
court
not
just
the
--
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
mean
on
the
habeas
corpus
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
year
did
you
get
into
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
that
part
of
appointment?
unknown
speaker
had
you
taken
judge
love’s
deposition
in
the
habeas
case?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
hold
to
--
you
suggested
that
that
you
had
argued
at
one
point
in
this
controversy
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
are
you
referring
that
to
the
fact
that
counsel
failed
to
object?
unknown
speaker
was
the
practice
in
texas
generally
for
lawyers
to
object
when
they
thought
the
court
had
made
a
ruling
that
was
adverse
to
the
client’s
interest?
unknown
speaker
ca5
i
think
in
hernandez,
repeated
what
it
said
earlier
that
this
error,
constitutional
or
otherwise
could
be
waived
by
failing
to
object.
are
you
suggesting
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
counsel
to
object
in
order
to
accomplish
a
waiver,
is
that
right?
are
you
saying
an
objection
is
not
necessary
under
any
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
and
he
waive
it
through
his
counsel,
that
is
my
point.
unknown
speaker
can
he
waive
it
through
his
counsel?
unknown
speaker
that
is
(inaudible)
fair
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
jury
trial
--
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
itself
was
held
non-retroactive.
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
it
then
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
assuming
hernandez
was
a
new
departure
however
retroactivity
is
involved
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well
hernandez
is
the
first
time
that
ever
suggests
that
it
was
putting
it
on
a
constitutional
basis.
unknown
speaker
they
just
said
fundamentally
unfair?
unknown
speaker
is
it
unfair?
unknown
speaker
well,
then—
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
could
you
--
in
the
hernandez
case
on
rehearing
the
fifth
circuit
said
this,
appellees
petitioned
for
a
hearing
states
that
surely
some
burden
must
be
put
onto
the
defendant
and
his
attorney
to
make
note
that
he
desires
to
be
tried
in
civilian
clothes
before
the
state
can
be
held
accountable
for
his
being
tried
in
jail
clothes.
and
the
court
said,
we
agree.
and
our
opinion
is
not
the
contrary.
the
defendant
may
not
remain
silent
and
willingly
go
to
trial
in
prison
garb
and
there
after
claim
error.
now,
is
that
the
rule
that
was
applied
in
the
case
before
us?
unknown
speaker
that
isn’t
what
they
said
on
the
hearing.
that
was
in
the
main
opinion.
here
they
said
just
what
i
just
said.
this
is
what
i
read
you.
it
said,
we
agree,
a
defendant
may
not
remain
silent
and
willingly
go
to
trial
in
prison
garb.
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
but
they
went
on
to
explain
why
you
could
not
in
hernandez,
why
you
could
not
stick
him
with
a
waiver
because
he
thought
it
might
–
he
did
not
think
he
had
any
chance
whatsoever
to
win
such
a
motion.
unknown
speaker
well
i
know,
but
you
just
told
us
that
there
had
been
so
many
–
you
just
told
us
what
the
rule
was
in
hernandez.
that
this
is
that
–
it
was
not
a
new
rule
at
all
and
any
fool
ought
to
know
that
you
should
not
try
a
fellow
in
prison
garb.
then
the
rule
of
--
since
brooks
and
all
these
other
decisions
in
all
those
cases.
so
why
would
not
you
oblige
the
attorney
to
speak
up?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
we
are
not
bound
by
hernandez,
that
is
a
fifth
circuit.
but
even
on
hernandez
basis,
they
have
some
very
special
reason
for
saying
there
was
no
voluntarily
waiver
in
hernandez.
that
certainly
–
it
does
not
seem
to
apply
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
the
key
to
it
in
this
case?
after
quoting
what
justice
white
has
just
read
you
from
hernandez,
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
say
waiver
in
the
objection
cannot
be
inferred
merely
from
failure
to
object,
if
trial
in
a
prison
garb
is
customary
and
the
jurisdiction
like
your
position
is
that
it
was
customary
and
that
is
what
this
habeas
record
shows.
you
say
that
judge
love’s
affidavit
does
not
really
depict
the
actual
practice,
which
you
say
in
judge
love’s
court
was
always
to
try
in
prison
garb,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
fifth
circuit
goes
on,
it
must
be
shown
that
the
practice
was
not
customary
and
might
not
be
insisted
upon
or
subject
to
or
that
the
defendant
hope
to
illicit
sympathy
by
his
appearance
in
such
clothing.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
trying
of
person
in
prison
garb
when
he
objects
or
even
when
does
not
object
is
an
error
that
could
be
harmless?
unknown
speaker
yes.
could
you
hold
it
to
be
it
harmless
error?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
a
man
requests
to
be
tried
in
his
civilian
clothes
was
turned
down,
then
they
go
to
trial
and
he
is
convicted.
and
the
state
defends
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
harmless
error.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
determine
whether
it
is
harmless
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
can’t.
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
you
can
not
examine
the
jurors.
unknown
speaker
they
permitted
inquiry
of
the
jurors
themselves?
unknown
speaker
inaudible)
is
it
the
case
in
texas
that
you
may
impeach
a
jury
verdict
by
examine
of
the
jurors?
unknown
speaker
first
of
all?
unknown
speaker
but
then
that
can
still
be
harmless
in
the
view
of
these
courts
that
have
decided
this
case.
unknown
speaker
beyond
it
then
so
that
the
court
can
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
however
he
might
have
been
dressed
at
the
time
of
his
trial
he
would
have
been
found
guilty.
unknown
speaker
that
isn’t
the
inquiry
that
was
made
from
--
that
has
been
made
the
juries
in
these
situations.
you
just
suggested
you
do
ask
jurors
whether
they
notice
the
clothing.
unknown
speaker
so
that
indicates
that
you
--
that
it
has
happened
that
at
least
once
in
these
cases
that
you
do
inquire
from
the
jurors
of
the
impact
of
the
clothing?
unknown
speaker
or
you
could
have
been
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
aderholt,
(inaudible)
you
disagree
with
justice
stewart
that
is
the
(inaudible)
the
evidence
we
saw
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
chapman
that
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
stirring
the
issues
before
the
court
in
chapman
and
is
suggesting
by
his
question
he
–
what
was
said
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
i
remember
well.
but
chapman
decided
that
if
a
constitutional
error
existed
in
a
case,
a
conviction
nonetheless
could
be
affirmed
if
the
court
could
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
that
error
did
not
affect
the
verdict
to
guilt.
but
recognized
exceptions
amongst
which
were
deprivations
of
the
right
to
counsel.
whether
or
not
that
was
rational,
that
is
what
the
