we

hear
arguments
next
in

74-676.
mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
after
lunch.
mr.
sullivan
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
sullivan.
mr.
aderholt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
his
counsel
has
consented
on
the
record
to
being
tried
in
jail
clothing
because
he
wants
to
be
tried
in
jail
clothing?
does
the
judge
then
require
to
explain
to
the
jury
that
you
must
draw
no
inferences
from
this
because
the
defendant
affirmatively
wishes
to
be
tried
in
jail
clothing.
that
would
seem
to
follow
from
your
colloquy
with
justice
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
suggest,
the
jury
infers
when
there
has
been
a
trial
in
jail
clothing
by
request.
if
nothing
has
explained
to
them?
don’t
they
draw
the
same
inferences
that
the
would
in
any
other
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
just
as
harmful
or
just
as
beneficial
depending
on
the
point
of
view
as
in
the
case
where
he
has
not
the
consented,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
did
not
renew
that
request
to
the
trial
judge
who
was
presiding
over
the
trial,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn’t
he
the
–
isn’t
that
judge
the
person
who
has
the
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
really
bring
yourself
to
say
that
this
is
the
right
not
to
be
tried
in
prison
garb,
is
you
can
equate
with
the
right
of
counsel
that
was
involved
in
zerbst
if
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
bind
him
on
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
understand
you,
do
you
agree
that
this
judge
is
the
same
judge
who
lent
a
suit
of
clothing
to
a
defendant
who
objected
to
be
tried
in
jail
clothes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
affidavit
says
that
this
happened
on
several
occasions
when
he
had
people
that
brought
the
clothing
in
and
they
were
permitted
to
change
into
civilian
clothes
in
the
jury
room.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
that
suggest
an
objection
has
been
made
this
judge
would
promptly
granted
to
what
you
say
is
required?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
we
are
talking
about
this
case.
you
conceived
that
no
objection
was
made.
and
i
took
that
you
agreed
that
judge
had
on
prior
cases
supplied
clothing.
did
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
must
have
had
found
some
of
the
basis
for
reversal
in
light
of
chief
justice
white
just
read
to
you.
