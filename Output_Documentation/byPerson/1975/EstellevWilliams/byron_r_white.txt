would
he,
assuming
he
requested
to
be
tried
in
his
civilian
clothes,

this
is
why
i
asked
before
as
to
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
to
be
less
offensive
for
the
defendant
to
be
in
issued
garments
rather
than
in
his
own.
one
can
imagine
that
certain
types
of
dress
would
not
be
very
welcome
in
harris
county
or
any
other
county.
i
am
trying

get

is
in
trying
a
man
in
prison
clothes.
