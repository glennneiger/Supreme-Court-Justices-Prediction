but
then
let
me
go
back
to
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
suppose
this
man’s
regular
clothing
were
rather
hippy
type
and
he
showed
up
in
sandals
in
december
in
harris
county
and
insisted
on
wearing
those
clothes,
might
he
not
be
worse
off
in
the
eyes
of
a
particular
jury
than
to
be
in
a
clean
--prison
garb.
while
you’re
answering
that,
you
and
your
opponents
say
different
things
about
where
harris
county
jail
is.
you
said
it
was
on
his
chest,
your
opponent
said
it
was
on
the
back.
what
does
the
record
show?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
this
connection
do
you
accept
judge
love’s
exhibit
to
--
well,
the
exhibit
which
is
judge
love’s
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
on
numerous
occasions
during
that
period
of
time
since
1958.
i
have
granted
request
by
defendants
or
their
attorneys
for
them
to
be
allowed
to
obtain
civilian
clothes
to
wear
at
their
trials.
i
have
never
compelled
a
defendant
to
go
to
trial
in
jail
clothes
whenever
his
attorney
requests
otherwise.
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
had
this
request
been
made
of
me,
i
would
have
granted
such
request
and
permitted
the
defendant
to
tried
in
civilian
clothing.
do
you
accept
this
as
a
statement
of
fact
in
this
case
or
do
you
not?
