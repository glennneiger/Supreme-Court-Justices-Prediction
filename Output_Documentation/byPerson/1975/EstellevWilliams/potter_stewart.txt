justice
potter
stewart
the
fifth
circuit
said
test
of
harmless
error.
as
i
understand
it
the
the
thomas
case
does
not
go
to
the
jurors
impression
about
the
prison
–-about
the
clothing
the
defendant
has
worn
but
rather
as
to
what
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
in
the
case
and
if
it
was
so
overwhelming
that
the
court
can
say
with
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
would
have
been
found
guilty
whatever
what
ever
he
was
wearing
or
not
wearing.
then
they
find
it
was
harmless
error.
that
is
the
thomas
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
goes
into
that
at
some
way?
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
only
question
was
whether
the
inquiry
as
to
the
harmlessness
of
the
error
was
directed
to
the
jury’s
impression.
there,
the
impressions
the
jury,
the
members
of
the
jury
drew
from
the
clothing
he
was
wearing
or
rather
does
it
go
to
the
evidence
of
guilt
in
the
case
and
it
does
--
it
is
the
latter
to
which
the
courts
have
directed
their
inquiries
and
not
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
error
was
harmless?
