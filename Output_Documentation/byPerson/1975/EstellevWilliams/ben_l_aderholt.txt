mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
respond
first
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
presented
to
mr.
sullivan
and
then
i
will
present
on
the
rest
of
the
argument.
the
identity
of
jail
clothes
in
the
texas,
i
agree
with
mr.
sullivan.
is
as
he
has
described
it,
i
would
add
that
the
penitentiary
garb
and
the
jail
garb,
i
believe
the
testimony
show
is
the
same.
same
white
coveralls,
possibly
with
a
different
lettering
on
the
garment
showing
whether
it
is
a
jail
or
the
department
of
corrections.
in
addition
to
that
the
defendant
has
brought
in
shower
tongs.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
shower
tongs
where
the
feet
slip
through
are
kind
of
a
crows
foot.
the
defendants
were
all
tried.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
shower
tongs,
that
is
what
i
called
them,
it
is
what
i
believe
the
defendant
called
them
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
where
its
feet
–
sandals
–
where
his
feet
are
bare
and
he
slips
one
of
the
tongs
through
his
toe.
this
was
in
november,
a
cold
month,
and
i
think
this
would
have
been
sort
of
been
something
that
the
jury
would
have
immediately
seen.
the
second—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
think
it
carries
with
it
all
kinds
of
negative
inferences.
the
same
could
then
--
if
the
defendant
had
come
in
in
a
rabbi’s
clothing
or
surgeons
whites
rather
that
prison
white,
i
think
that
the
jury
make
short
hand
assessment
of
the
defendant
especially
in
this
case
where
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
am
not
sure
that
the
jury,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
knows
or
should
know
whether
the
defendant
cannot
make
bail.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
think
precisely
because
we
are
not
able
to
measure
what
the
jury
thinks
of
a
man
who
comes
in
dressed
like
this.
in
addition
to
that
i
believe
–
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
one
of
the
lower
courts
stated
that
the
prosecutor
could
not
have
gotten
administrable
prior
convictions
or
other
charges
brought
against
the
defendant.
he
also
stated
that
the
jury
might
have
inferred
or
probably
did
infer
from
the
appearance
of
the
defendant
that
he
had
other
charges
pending
or
was
a
convicted
criminal
and
was
too
dangerous
to
release.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
because
he
has
jail
printed
on
his
chest.
and
because
he
is
not
a
free
man
he
is
brought
in
by
the
sheriff
and
he—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
but
he
does
not
have
the
choice
of
putting
on
clothes
that
would
be
--
make
him
look
like
an
ordinary
average
jury
where
the
defendant
that
has
presumption
and
dignity
and
the
self-respect
of
a
free
man.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
in
view
of
the
long
line
of
cases,
i
think
a
trial
judge
might
consider
something
in
his
charge
just
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
trial.
on
the
other
hand,
i
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
garcia
which
carved
out
this
exception
in
which
he
uses
as
a
trial
tactic
to
gain
sympathy
from
the
jury.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
if
i
understand
your
correction,
your
question
and
statement
correctly,
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
that
they
would
draw
the
same
inference.
i
would
think—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
would
never
consider
to
be
a
beneficial
thing.
some
lawyers
may
believe
that
it
would
be
beneficial
to
gain
sympathy
because
he
had
been
in
jail
and
could
not
get
out
and
prepare
his
defense,
that
he
had
been
incarcerated
long
enough
for
this
kind
of
offense
and
therefore
no
longer.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
believe
the
record
does
show
it
to
be
on
his
back.
the
hippy
clothes
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
cannot
imagine
any
lawyer
not
being
extremely
cautious
in
trying
and
dressing
his
defendant
for
a
trial
before
an
average
jury
in
texas
especially
and
i
think
anywhere.
they
objective
would
be
to
emulate
or
give
a
mirror
image
to
the
jury
as
restated
in
an
article
in
the
practical
lawyer
by
a
prosecutor
in
ohio
and
he
takes
our
position
that
it
is
extremely
unfair.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
think
that
is
the
distinction,
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
we
do.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
he
made
no
objection.
the
record
shows
that
he
asked
the
captain
and
he
named
the
captain
on
the
trial
in
habeas
corpus
who
refused
to
let
him
put
on
a
suit
that
the
man
had
pressed
and
waiting
for
him
at
the
rehabilitation
center.
in
addition
to
that,
the
rehabilitation
center
where
the
defendants
live
are
some
miles
from
the
trial
location
in
houston,
texas.
at
that
time
the
accused
requested
a
suit
that
he
had
ready
and
waiting
for
him
and
this
was
denied.
this
was
refused.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no
he
did
not.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
your
honor,
i
think
he
should
have
made
an
objection.
this
was
an
inept
trial
by
the
defense
councilor
if
i
could
say
so.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
we
argued
that
in
the
fifth
circuit.
however,
we
felt
the
stronger
case
was
on
previous
presidential
decisions.
i
would
like
to
add
to
that
that
the
trial
judge
appointed
a
lawyer
to
represent
this
man
earlier
in
1970.
the
main
thing
is
that
the
that
the
defendant
was
indigent
and
the
trial
court
allowed
this
trial
to
proceed
with
the
defendant
in
jail
clothes
in
the
face
of
some
19
decisions
before
december
of
1970
in
15
different
courts
including
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
the
fifth
circuit
in
brooks
versus
texas,
and
some
nine
or
ten
supreme
court
decisions
in
other
states.
i
believe
that
it
was
well
established
law,
a
rule
and
by
the
time
that
the
defendant
was
tried
there
were
nine
supreme
court
decisions
in
florida,
colorado,
alabama,
arkansas,
pennsylvania,
michigan
--
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no
your
honor.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
sheriff
is
the
one
who
compelled
the
accused
to
wear
these
clothes.
the
state
did
this.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
he
should
have
made
an
objection
to
the
court.
he
did
not
--
the
decisions
do
not
require
an
objection
in—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no
your
honor.
i
am
talking
about
lower
courts
decision.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
with
the
exception
of
the
fundamental
nature
that
you
discussed,
i
think
that
an
objection
should
be
lodged
but
there
are
those
cases
where
as
in
this
case,
as
in
hernandez
as
in
many
others
where
the
circumstances
are
such
where
any
objection
is
chilled.
the
lawyer
testified
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
that
he
had
made
an
objection
in
the
trial
court
in
that
county
before
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no,
i
do
not
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
trial
judge,
i
do
not
believe
would
do
it
–
falsify
such
an
affidavit.
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
not
know
who
prepared
the
affidavit,
it
was
brought
the
day
of
trial,
i
strenuously
objected
that
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
that
statement.
i
had
had
their
positions
in
the
case
on
these
very
issues
showing
the
practice
of
that
trial
court.
every
case
tried
in
his
court
on
an
non-bailed
defendant
was
tried
in
prison
garb.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
judge
love’s
court.
every
defendant,
there
was
no
exception.
and
this
affidavit
showed
up
and
trial
now
objected
to
judge
buhe
(ph).
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
on
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
yes
your
honor
that
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
that
statement
because
i
believe
the
facts
to
be
otherwise.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
end
of
--
early
1971,
i
believe
you
honor.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it
was
by
appointment
of
of
judge
love.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no.
i
took
the
deposition
of
his
clerk
and
the
sheriff
and
the
–
every
single
lawyer
who
tried
the
case
where
the
defendant
was
tried
in
prison
garb.
and
that
was
introduced
in
the
evidence
of
the
case
of
a
habeas
corpus
hearing.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
think
that
that
was
one
of
my
grounds.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
do
not
know
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
think
though
that
if
it
is
a
fundamental
error
that
there
would
be
no
objection
required.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
think
it
is
wise
unless
the
record
reflects
what
you
complaint
of.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
believe
that
the
rule
is
presently
in
all
jurisdictions
with
varying
degrees
that
there
is
no
objection
required.
i
do
believe
the
error
–
that
the
rule
should
be
stated
that
its
an
error
to
try
an
accuse
in
prison
garb
unless
he
voluntarily
waives
a
known
right,
reserves
standard.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
he
may.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
he
may.
i
certainly
think
he
should
be
able
to
and
could.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
answer
that
question.
i
do
believe
that
it
is
a
fundamental
nature
to
the
fairness
of
a
jury
trial.
i
believe
that
the—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
your
honor
but
i
do
not
believe
retroactivity
even
comes
in
to
this
case.
i
tried
to
persuade
the
fifth
circuit
not
to
discuss
retroactivity.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
because
we
have
19
decisions
before
the
case
was
even
tried—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
because
the
fifth
circuit
made
it
so.
but
i
do
believe
that
they—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no
you
honor.
i
believe
brooks
versus
texas—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
they
said
that
it—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it
was
said
it
was
inherently
prejudicial.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
but
we
have
four,
five
federal
courts
handing
down
decisions
on
the
jail
clothes
case
before
williams
was
tried
in
harris
county.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
but
i
was
speaking
in
terms
of
retroactivity
in
connection
to
the
constitutional
right.
the
fifth
circuit
has
clearly
indicated
that
it
was
a
fundamental—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
fundamental
protection.
one
of
the
earlier
statements
was
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
laid
down
a
per
se
rule
in
hernandez
and
also
in
williams
and
the
way
i
read
the
case
is
that
it
is
not
a
per
se
rule.
and
it
is
not
a
per
se
rule
in
any
of
the
many
and
lengthy
decisions
across
the
country.
in
all
of
these
cases
it
appears
to
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
harmless
error
or
whether
it
is
harmless
or
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
add
that
one
element
that
i
have
not
stressed
is
that
all
of
these
cases
that
we
are
discussing
are
a
particular
class
of
defendant.
they,
if
i
may
say
so
generally
have
poor
counsel.
they
generally
are
not
protected
as
thoroughly
as
someone
who
is
able
to
hire
an
attorney
and
get
out
of
jail
and
defend
himself.
there
further
is
no
legitimate
state
interest
in
trying
a
defendant
in
jail
clothes.
it
is
simply
an
unnecessary
influence
on
the
jury.
the
prosecutor
of
williams
was
brought
by
the
government,
by
the
state
to
testify
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
and
the
prosecutor
in
judge
love’s
court
stated
that
he
encountered
jurors
who
were
hostile
to
defendants
because
they
were
brought
in
jail
clothes.
that
was
his
own
testimony.
any
attorney
who
tries
jury
cases
in
texas
knows
that
jurors
–
it
is
almost
impossible
to
convince
them
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
if
defense
rested
after
the
defendant
was
brought
in
in
an
indictment
read,
many
defendants
would
be
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble.
if
the
defense
stopped
right
there
even
though
the
presumption
of
innocence
would
apply
to
them.
i
believe
that
putting
a
defendant
in
this
kind
of
a
garb
is
simply
unnecessary,
it
gives
jury
negative
inferences
and
in
this
particular
case
where
the
defendant
does
not
take
the
stand
the
jury
must
make
its
assessment.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
meant
to
cover
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
affidavit
or
the
exhibit
that
was
referred
to
earlier
did
not,
i
believe
state
that
quite
clearly.
the
judge
did
say
he
had
lent
a
suit
of
civilian
clothes
to
a
defendant.
again
this
was
not
subject
to
my
cross
examination
and
we
do
not
know
when
he
is
talking
about.
i
think
that
the
judge
was
very
sensitive
at
this
issue
because
hernandez
had
been
handed
down
already.
the
practice
was
--
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
but
we
do
not
know
when
--
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
that
might
be
a
fair
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
that.
i
do
not
accept
it
though
because
it
never
happened.
all
the
defendants
were
tried
in
jail
clothes.
we
do
not
know
whether
the
objections
–
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no.
i
did
not
mr.
chief
justice.
i
stated
that
we
did
not
know
very
much
about
those
occasions
whether
they
occurred
before
williams
trial
or
after
williams
trial.
and
i
do
not
know
of
any
incidence
where
this
judge
has
done
this.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it
was.
the
fifth
circuit
followed
brooks.
its
earlier
decision
in
brooks
versus
texas
in
1967
and
made
a
very
strong
policy
statement.
and
also
held
in
hernandez
versus
texas,
a
very
strong
case
and
it
looked
like
it
was
a
per
se
rule.
i
think
on
rehearing
it
to
a
small
step
back
and
stated
all
of
the
chapman
and
harrington
tests
should
come
into
play.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
but
hernandez
made
no
objection
your
honor.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
well
that
was
trial
counsel’s
testimony
in
the
habeas
corpus
in
this
case—
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
because
hernandez
made
no
objection.
the
court
said
we
do
not
decide
that
is
not
a
voluntary
waiver.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
your
honor,
the
facts
in
hernandez
and
in
williams
are
practically
identical.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
believe
that
their
statement
on
motion
for
rehearing
is
that
the
defendant
may
not
willingly
go
to
trial
and
later
claim
error.
however,
there
was
no
objection
in
hernandez
and
so
it
must
be
taken
to
mean
and
within
the
meaning
of
the
opinion
that
an
objection
is
not
required.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
that
precisely
is
my
position
and
i
believe
that
the
hernandez
case
when
looked
at
on
its
motion
rehearing
is
clear
and
is
co-inscribed
with
the
other
circuit
–
the
other
cases
on
point
from
1938
on.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
do
i
believe
that
it
could
be
ever
be
harmless?
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
oh,
yes,
i
do.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
think
that
it
could
be
harmless
and
i
think
that
ought
to
be
test
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
and
i
believe
is
in
all
jurisdictions
that
it
is
an
fundamental
error
to
try
an
accused
in
prison
garb
unless
he
voluntarily
waives
the
right
and
if
the
probable
impact
on
the
jury
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
per
se
rule
is
easier
to
apply
but
i
believe
that
is
the
rule,
as
found
in
all
the
jurisdictions
up
to
1979.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
that
is.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
that
is
awfully
broad.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it
was
done
in
the
habeas
hearing
that
counsel
just
referred
to
and
it
should
and
could
have
been
done
in
this
case.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
question
should
have
been
gone
in
to.
now
the
hernandez
decision
and
williams
decision
and
the
thomas
decision,
all
fifth
circuit
decisions
went
to
the
test
of
harmless
error
on
the
angle
of
sufficiency
of
evidence.
in
hernandez,
the
court
said
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
i
think
the
question,
the
inquisition
of
the
jury
was
whether
or
not
they
identified
it
as
a
prison
uniform
and
whether
or
not
it
made
any
impact
on.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it
is
and
i
believe
that
is
the
holding
in
all
these
jurisdictions
of
the
cases
that
i
have
and
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
go
into
my
view
of
the
sufficiency
or
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
a
assault
with
intent
to
murder
with
malice.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it
does
at
some
length
and
the
testimony
is
set
out
--
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it
does
mr.
justice
stewart
and
it
also
however
mentions
the
reason
i
bring
this
in
that
the
defendant
in
order
to
win
must
prove
that
he
was
tried
in
an
identifiable
jail
or
prison
garb.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
first
to
either
--
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes.
all
the
courts
have
determined
the
harmless
error
under
chapman
to
be
one
of
the
grounds
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
your
honor.
that
should
be
--
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no
your
honor.
i
believe
that
my
answer
was
that
there
was
one
case
that
was
brought
up
in
the
state's
brief
where
jurors
were
questioned
on
the
habeas
corpus
as
to
whether
one
they
identified
this
as
a
prison
garb
and
they
said
they
did
not.
and
secondly
whether
or
not
what
was
the
impact
i
believe
was
the
other
inquiry.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes
your
honor.
i
think
the
state
could
have
subpoenaed
those
12
jurors
and
asked
them
to
defeat
our
claim.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
or
i
could
have
but
i
think
that
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
so
poor
to
prove
that
he
was
guilty
of
defense
with
malice
that
we
took
–
we
chose
not
to
bring
the
jurors
in
and
that
is
a
difficult
thing
to
do
is
to
bring
jurors
in.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
no.
i
would
not
follow
that
logic.
i
do
however
believe
that
this
has
been
many,
many
years
of
decision
as
held
down
by
lower
courts
since
1938
that
this
is
one
of
the
tests
to
be
used
under
chapman
and
harrington.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
yes,
and
included
within
this
concept
of
harmless
error,
i
guess
you
would
have
to
put
in
the
two
exceptions
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
other
decisions
of
the
garcia
exception
where
he
uses
a
trial
tactic
and
secondly
the
henderson
exception
where
the
crime
was
committed
in
prison
and
it
was
impossible
to
keep
it
from
the
jury.
mr.
ben
l.
aderholt
it’s
been
a
great
honor.
