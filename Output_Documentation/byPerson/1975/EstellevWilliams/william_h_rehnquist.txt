what
if
they
had
seen
it?
what
is
unfair
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
that
be?
no,
he’s
been
indicted
and
it
is
probably
no
secret
to
most
jurors
that
criminal
defendants
who
cannot
make
bail,
spend
time
at
jail
between
the
time
of
their
arraignment
in
trial
but
what
does
this
add
to
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
it
prejudice
the
jury
in
determining
the
issues
in
this
criminal
offense
of
which
he
is
charged
to
know
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
make
bail
or
to
know
that
he
had
been
able
to
make
bail.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
wait
a
minute.
you
say
because
we
do
not
know
therefore
we
decided
it
is
unconstitutional,
i
would
think
that
the
rule
was
just
the
opposite
but
there
is
a
presumption
of
constitutionality.
and
if
you
do
not
know,
that
is
a
reason
for
saying
there
is
no
constitutional
affirmity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
any
sort
of
a
permissible
inference
on
the
jury’s
part
that
he
had
prior
convictions
from
seeing
him
in
prison
garb?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
is
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
during
the
trial
whether
he
has
got
prison
garb
on
him
or
not,
isn’t
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
the
only
reason
that
fifth
circuit
could
upset
a
texas
conviction
would
be
on
constitutional
basis,
wouldn’t
it.
