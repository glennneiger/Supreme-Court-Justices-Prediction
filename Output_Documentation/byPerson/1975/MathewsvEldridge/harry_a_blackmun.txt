mr.
earl,
you
are
not
saying
that
a
co-medical
record
as
you
described
it
is
totally
objective
and
does
not
include
subjective
aspects,
are
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
take
that
for
me
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
according
to
their
diagnosis,
58%
are
wrong?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
that
you
are
saying
that
the
house
would
not
have
been
foreclosed
had
there
not
been
termination?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
would
he
have
enough
money?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
thus,
it
would
have
been
foreclosed
in
any
event?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
why
are
you
arguing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
question
is
that,
would
he
have
lost
his
house
had
the
benefits
not
been
terminated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
termination
was
the
difference
between
keeping
his
house
and
not
keeping
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
this
record
show
that?
