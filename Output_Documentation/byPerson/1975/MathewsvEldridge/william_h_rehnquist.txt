justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
this
respondent
did
not
have
a
post-termination
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
salfi
as
i
recall
said
that
actions
brought
for
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
arrive
could
only
be
brought
under
that
particular
jurisdictional
section.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
man
would
never
be
in
court
if
you
were
not
asserting
some
claim
to
a
benefit
under
the
social
security
act,
would
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
man
would
not
be
in
court
if
you
were
not
asserting
some
claim
to
a
benefit
under
social
security
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
did
you
get
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes
and
the
statute
that
we
construed
in
salfi
said
that
if
you
were
claiming
benefits
under
the
social
security
act,
you
bring
your
action
under
205
(g)
and
not
otherwise,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
compare
1,100
with
the
total
number
rather
than
with
the
1,800?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
presumably
the
ones
most
having
the
strongest
cases
are
the
ones
that
are
going
to
the
hearing.
the
ones
with
the
least
substantial
plans
are
going
to
accept
the
adverse
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
itself
is
a
medical
the
termination,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anyway
of
knowing
in
the
case
of
these
25,000
that
accept
the
initial
determination
whether
the
basis
for
the
determination
was
medical
records
or
return
to
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
permits
any
breakdown?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
manual
covers
old
age
pension,
survivorâ€™s
benefit,
as
well
as
disability
benefit,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
i
take
that
the
statement
is
a
general
one
presumably
referring
to
all
aspects
of
the
social
security
program?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
point
of
the
argument?
