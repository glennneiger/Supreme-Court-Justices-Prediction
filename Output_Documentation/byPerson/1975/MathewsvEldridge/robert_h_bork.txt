mr.
robert
h.
bork
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
issue
we
brought
up
is
the
question
of
whether
social
security
disability
benefits
can
be
terminated
in
a
procedure
which
allows
for
the
submission
of
evidence
by
the
claimant,
written
evidence,
but
does
not
include
an
oral
hearing.
the
court
below
held
an
oral
hearing
was
required
by
the
fifth
amendment’s
due
process
clause
under
an
extension
of
the
rational
of
goldberg
against
kelly.
here,
the
secretary
of
hew
terminated
respondent’s
disability
payments
in
1972
on
the
basis
of
medical
reports
and
respondent
was
given
a
summary
of
that
evidence,
given
an
opportunity
to
submit
additional
evidence
and
a
written
rebuttal.
there
were
post-termination
procedures
available
to
him,
including
a
full
oral
evidentiary
hearing
which
i
will
describe
in
a
moment,
but
he
brought
this
suit
instead
of
availing
himself
of
those
procedures,
claiming
a
constitutional
right
to
a
pre-termination
oral
hearing.
i
have
two
propositions
to
advance.
the
first
is
a
late
blooming
jurisdictional
issue
and
to
be
candid
about
it,
the
reason
it
is
late
blooming
is
because
our
initial
analysis
of
the
application
of
weinberger
against
salfi
decided
last
june
to
this
case
resulted
in
the
conclusion
which
we
now
think
erroneous,
but
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
here.
we
proceeded
for
some
time
on
that
belief
and
it
was
not
until
work
on
other
cases
required
re-thinking
of
the
problem
that
we
reversed
ourselves
and
came
to
a
contrary
conclusion
that
salfi’s
rational
precludes
the
district
court’s
assertion
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
basis
for
the
original
conclusion
was
not
my
own
conclusion
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
believe
it
was
that
the
constitutional
issue
might
be
final
here.
i
believe
the
thinking
was
that
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
was
the
reasoning.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
but
coming
to
the
opposite
conclusion,
we
prepared
the
brief
on
jurisdiction
issue
and
served
the
typed
script
on
respondent’s
counsel
a
week
ago
and
obviously
they
should
have
time
to
reply
in
a
brief
to
our
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
to
file
a
brief
in
response.
i
have
really
very
little
to
add
to
the
jurisdictional
argument
made
in
that
supplemental
brief.
so
i
would
to
like
to
maybe
outline
it
and
spend
most
of
my
time
if
i
may
on
the
due
process
question
where
i
believe
there
may
be
something
to
add
to
the
brief.
the
jurisdictional
problem
is
this.
the
relevant
statute
is
section
205
of
the
social
security
act
codified
as
42
u.s.c.
405
and
205
(h)
which
was
involved
in
salfi
as
it
is
here
states
that
no
findings
of
fact
or
decision
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
person,
tribunal,
or
governmental
agency
except
as
herein
provided.
now,
in
salfi,
this
court
concluded
that
205(h)
precludes
the
assertion
of
district
court
jurisdiction
except
insofar
as
jurisdiction
is
then
provided
in
section
205
(g)
and
if
we
turn
to
205
(g),
we
see
that
it
confers
jurisdiction
upon
district
courts
to
review
any
final
decision
of
the
secretary
made
after
a
hearing.
those
provisions
were
not
dispositive
in
salfi,
but
they
seem
to
be
here.
in
salfi,
the
only
issue
was
a
constitutional
issue
whether
a
categorization
made
by
a
statute
was
a
constitutional
categorization.
so
that
it
would
have
been
as
the
court
said
futile
and
wasteful
to
require
the
claimant
to
exhaust
the
administrative
process
and
it
also
decided,
the
court
also
said
that
the
secretary
had
decided
that
the
reconsideration
decision
involved
in
salfi
was
final.
now,
neither
of
these
grounds
is
present
in
this
case.
here
the
secretary
did
not
base
his
decision
on
a
statutory
probation
or
statutory
categorization
of
eligibility
which
is
subject
to
the
constitutional
attack,
but
upon
a
factual
the
termination
that
this
respondent
was
in
medical
effect
no
longer
disabled.
and
it
would
not
have
been
futile
and
wasteful
to
ask
this
respondent
to
exhaust
its
administrative
remedies
which
is
i
say
would
have
included
an
oral
hearing.
moreover,
the
secretary
has
not
here
determined
that
the
order
terminating
disability
benefits
was
final.
he
was
entitled
to
administrative
reconsideration,
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
so
forth.
he
availed
himself
of
none
of
this,
but
brought
suit
before
the
secretary
had
made
a
final
decision
after
a
hearing.
since
205
(g)
does
not
confer
jurisdiction
under
these
circumstances,
205
(h)
bars
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court.
i
think
there
is
no
mere
technicality.
it
is
important
to
judicial
administration
of
course
that
administration
remedies
be
exhausted,
even
when
not
required
by
statute,
and
here
at
congress
has
specifically
mandated
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
i
should
like
now
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
respondent’s
constitutional
claim
about
due
process.
the
issue
is
whether
he
is
entitled
as
a
matter
of
due
process
to
a
full
oral
evidentiary
hearing
before
any
benefits
paid
to
him
under
the
disability
insurance
program
may
be
stopped.
the
considerations
to
be
weighed
in
making
that
decision
of
course
are
well
known.
they
were
outlined
in
cafeteria
workers
against
mcelroy
and
stated
the
number
of
later
cases.
what
constitutes
constitutional
due
process
in
a
given
context
depends
upon
intensely
practical
considerations
peculiar
to
that
case
and
that
process
and
the
balancing
of
the
governmental
interests
and
the
private
interests
that
are
affected.
we
are
in
effect
dealing
with
a
cost
benefit
judgment
and
so
view
the
question
becomes
really
how
many
--
the
decision
of
this
case
will
have
a
heavy
impact
upon
the
decision
of
how
many
decisional
processes
of
government
must
be
conform
to
a
judicial
model
rather
than
to
an
administrative
model.
i
think
that
is
important
and
i
think
clearly
there
has
to
be
stopping
point
somewhere
to
the
imposition
of
judicial
models
upon
the
governmental
decision
making
because
it
is
very
expensive
and
in
some
circumstances
which
i
would
contend,
this
is
one,
adds
little
or
nothing
to
the
alternative
procedures
provided.
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
mean
expensive
in
terms
of
money
expended
in
terms
of
time
and
indeed
i
think
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
and
i
supposed
it
is
socially
expensive
because
i
think
in
this
case
for
example
if
one
were
required
to
continue
payments
until
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
could
be
had,
one
would
pay
a
lot
of
money
to
beneficiaries
who
claim
the
hearing
only
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
payments
going
and
i
think
that
imposes
a
social
cost
independent
of
money
upon
the
erosion
of
individual
character.
but
in
this
case
which
involves
one
of
these
massive
programs
with
thousands
--
hundreds
of
thousands
determinations
in
it,
i
think
we
face
something
not
like
the
ordinary
hearing
due
process
case
although
of
course
this
court
has
had
cases
similar
to
this
before.
but
it
is
crucial
here
i
think
to
understand
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
in
richards
against
wright,
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan,
although
these
are
the
procedures
that
have
just
been
instituted
prior
to
oral
argument
in
richards
against
wright.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
well,
i
think
the
thought
was
that
the
claimant
there
might
actually
under
the
new
procedures
be
paid
and
the
case
would
be
mooted
by
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
these
are
the
new
procedures
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
see
the
kinds
of
safeguards
they
provide
and
the
kinds
of
results
they
produce.
the
act
provides
that
the
initial
determination
after
a
man
has
been
qualified,
a
worker
has
been
qualified
for
disability
payments,
he
is
told
if
there
is
any
possibility
of
recovery
from
his
medical
disability
that
he
will
examined
to
see
if
recovery
has
occurred
because
if
disability
ceases,
the
payments
cease
and
the
congress
has
mandated
that
state
agencies
were
used
for
making
the
initial
the
termination
about
the
cessation
of
disability.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
they
want
to
draw
these
workers
into
vocational
rehabilitation
therapy
and
training
and
those
are
primarily
the
state
agencies
that
are
used
for
this
purpose.
so
that
a
state
agency,
working
under
standards
and
procedures
laid
down
by
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
requests
the
worker
to
supply
information
periodically
on
a
questionnaire
that
shows
his
present
condition,
his
medical
treatment
and
medical
restriction
placed
upon
him
and
so
forth.
if
that
questionnaire
does
not
show
clear
cut
recovery,
the
state
agency
then
obtains
information
from
the
treating
physician
of
the
claimant.
it
may
obtain
independent
consulting
examinations.
in
this
case
of
course
the
initial
the
termination
was
made
up
of
the
basis
of
a
previous
medical
record
which
was
on
the
files.
the
respondent’s
current
answers
to
the
questionnaire
about
his
condition,
the
current
report
of
his
treating
physician
and
the
report
of
an
independent
psychiatric
consultant
who
was
called
in
by
the
agency.
now,
this
material
when
it
is
gathered,
is
then
reviewed
by
a
state
agency
team
which
consists
of
another
physician
and
a
trained
disability
examiner.
if
the
worker
is
no
longer
disabled
in
their
opinion
after
examining
his
record
and
i
should
say
that
the
only
issue
is
one
in
fact
the
medical,
the
statute
requires
that
disability
be
proved
or
disapproved
by
medical
evidence
and
not
by
other
kinds
of
intuitions,
as
evidence
that
is
well
presented
in
other
words
in
a
written
record.
if
they
decide
that
that
claimant
is
probably
not
disabled
and
they
think
he
is
not
then
form
of
that
tentative
conclusion,
they
provide
him
with
a
summary
of
the
evidence
and
they
provide
ten
days
for
him
to
respond
in
writing
and
they
tell
him
that
if
he
wishes
additional
time
because
of
the
difficulty
of
procuring
the
evidence
he
needs
he
may
have
it.
they
also
tell
him
he
can
get
his
questions
answered
at
the
local
social
security
office.
now
here,
as
at
all
of
the
stages
of
this
process,
the
worker
is
entitled
to
be
assisted
by
a
counsel
or
by
any
other
representative
that
he
chooses,
it
is
often
is
by
union
representatives
or
somebody
of
that
sort
and
that
person
is
entitled
to
examine
all
the
evidence
in
the
file
including
the
medical
evidence.
respondent
here
declined
to
offer
any
additional
evidence
other
than
to
assert
that
he
did
not
have
a
back
sprain,
he
actually
had
arthritis
of
the
spine.
many
workers
do
offer
additional
evidence
and
often
get
the
initial
the
termination
of
no
disability
reverses.
but
if
the
tentative
conclusion
of
the
state
examining
team
is
not
changed,
the
report
is
forwarded
to
the
social
security
administrations
bureau
of
disability
insurance
where
it
is
reviewed
to
make
sure
that
it
is
in
conformity
with
national
standards.
if
that
office
thinks
that
perhaps
the
decision
should
have
been
favorable
to
the
work,
but
was
not,
it
has
no
legal
power
to
change
it,
but
it
may
and
does
send
the
case
back
for
reconsideration
and
i
believe
about
half
of
the
cases
in
fact
for
reconsideration
are
reconsidered
favorably
to
the
worker.
if
however
the
social
security
administration
accepts
the
the
termination
of
no
disability,
it
notifies
the
worker
in
writing,
states
the
basis
for
its
initial
determination
and
specifies
his
right
to
seek
further
review.
at
that
stage,
benefits
are
terminated
although
there
is
a
two-month
grace
period.
after
the
month
in
which
he
ceased
to
be
disabled,
that
grace
period
may
sometimes
run
by
them
or
it
may
still
have
some
time
to
run.
respondent
of
course
at
this
stage
filed
suit.
he
had
a
right
to
the
following
additional
remedies
which
he
did
not
elect
to
take.
he
can
ask
for
a
reconsideration,
he
gets
it
automatically.
that
means
that
a
wholly
different
team
of
physician
and
examiner
at
the
state
agency
review
the
record
de
novo,
consider
any
additional
evidence
submitted
by
the
worker
or
obtained
by
the
state
agency
such
as
another
medical
examination
and
that
decision
is
again
sent
for
review
to
the
social
security
administration.
there
is
a
reversal
right
that
is
significant
at
the
reconsideration
stage.
if
the
result
is
again
adverse
to
the
worker
he
can
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
a
social
security
administrative
judge.
he
may,
but
he
need
not
appear
personally.
social
security
administration
is
not
represented
by
counsel
or
by
staff.
it
is
not
an
adversary
hearing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
powell.
i
said
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
is
a
distinction
in
medical
practice.
apparently,
doctors
often
do
not
and
will
not
show
a
patient
his
own
file
either
because
an
embarrassment
might
result
or
in
some
cases
because
the
doctor
is
not
telling
the
patient
all
of
the
adverse
news
that
is
in
that
file.
hew
and
social
security
as
i
understand
it
are
now
reviewing
that
practice
and
asking
themselves
whether
they
should
conform
to
medical
practice
and
resolve
whether
they
should
allow
the
claimant
as
well
as
his
representative.
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
counsel,
his
representative
to
look
at
the
medical
evidence.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
it
is
mr.
justice
powell,
but
i
cannot
look
at
--
i
believe
it
is
in
the
regulation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
powell
a
claimant
who
cannot
get
anybody
to
represent
him,
that
is
it
could
be
a
relative,
it
could
be
a
union
representative,
it
could
be
any
representative
he
chooses.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
sir.
as
far
as
i
know
it
cannot
be.
if
i
am
wrong
in
the
statement
i
will
correct
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
have
operated
under
protective
orders.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
have
operated
under
protective
orders
occasionally
that
prevented
me
from
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
in
the
sense
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
think
under
current
medical
practice,
the
agency
would
have
some
difficulty
perhaps
getting
medical
reports
if
doctors
prefer
or
insist
upon
limiting
access
to
their
medical
files.
now
here,
the
claimant
gets
a
summary
of
the
medical
evidence
on
what
it
shows.
the
raw
file
is
available
to
any
representative
that
he
chooses
and
hew
is
looking
at
and
experimenting
as
i
understand
it
with
the
possibility
of
opening
the
raw
files
to
the
claimant
as
well.
but
as
the
matters
stand
now,
he
may
not
look
at
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
although
regulation
says
i
believe
that
he
is
entitled
to
subpoena
and
examination.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
government
puts
on
no
case
at
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
file
goes
in
and
the
administrative
law
judge
is
there,
but
the
government
is
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
i
understand
it,
he
may.
as
i
understand
the
regulations
about
it.
if
i
am
wrong,
i
am
sure
i
will
be
corrected
and
i
will
stand
corrected
likewise.
the
regulation
say
as
i
understand
he
is
entitled
to
subpoena
and
is
entitled
to
witnesses.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
what
i
understood.
i
hear
some
science
of
dissents
at
the
counsel
table
here,
but
that
was
my
understanding
of
the
process.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
they
are
not
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
white
because
they
are
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
only
question
here
is
whether
there
should
be
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
termination
and
the
post-termination
hearing
that
was
given
in
this
case
is
not
challenged.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
results
as
respondent’s
counsel
will
tell
you
at
a
very
high
rate
of
reversal
of
those
cases
taken
to
it.
so
that
it
appears
to
be
making
real
judgments.
of
course
a
very
few
cases
are
taken
that
far
because
most
of
these
determinations
are
accepted.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
did
not.
he
came
straight
to
court
after
the
initial
determination.
but
i
just
thought
it
was
important
to
point
out
what
this
process
offers
and
it
should
be
said
that
it
does
offer
an
impartial
tribunal,
it
offers
a
chance
to
submit
evidence.
it
offers
decisions
wholly
on
the
record.
it
offers
the
kinds
of
benefits
that
were
noted
in
richardson
against
perales
that
if
we
have
independent
and
unbiased
physicians
here,
these
are
not
government
physicians.
one
of
them
is
the
respondent’s
physician.
we
have
a
very
vast
system
with
thousands
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
determinations
so
that
that
makes
for
impartiality.
the
agency
does
not
operate
as
an
adversary
at
any
stage
in
this
process.
it
operates
only
as
an
adjudicator.
so,
the
due
process
question
i
think
then
comes
down
as
looking
at
this
entire
rather
elaborate
procedures
available,
the
safeguards
at
every
step,
what
would
be
gained
by
moving
an
evidentiary
hearing
up
before
the
initial
termination
decision
and
what
would
be
lost?
i
think
very
little
would
be
gained
and
i
think
a
very
great
deal
would
be
lost.
the
issue
was
medical
condition
which
is
not
an
issue
that
an
administrative
law
judge
gets
a
great
deal
of
information
about
by
looking
at
a
man
in
a
room,
even
the
demand
comes
he
need
not.
and
indeed,
the
decision
cannot
rest
upon
the
administrative
law
judges
to
look
at
the
man
and
feeling
about
his
condition.
it
has
to
rest
upon
medical
evidence
so
that
the
probate
of
evidence
here
is
the
kind
that
can
be
in
writing
and
can
be
challenged
in
writing.
and
he
not
only
has
his
own
doctor,
his
treating
physician
and
any
consulting
doctor
that
social
security
has
asked
for,
the
state
agency
has
asked
for.
he
gets
a
doctor
who
reviews
the
record
at
initial
the
termination
period.
now,
i
think
there
is
no
significant
likelihood
that
any
claim
is
going
to
be
damaged
significantly
by
the
timing
of
the
hearing.
i
have
been
looking
at
these
briefs
and
it
seems
to
me,
all
of
the
briefs
are
a
little
unrealistic
about
what
the
reversal
rate
is
in
these
cases.
our
brief
suggests
that
the
error
rate
in
the
initial
determination
is
12.2%
measured
against
what
happens
later.
but
i
think
it
is
really
more
realistic
to
look
at
this
process
at
the
reconsideration
stage
because
a
worker
is
terminated
and
can
get
reconsideration
rather
quickly
and
any
impact
he
may
feel
is
really
almost
de
minimis
at
that
stage
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
reconsideration
stage
is
the
same
kind
of
a
paper
record
determination
that
occurs
at
initial
determination
stage
so
that
the
reversal
rights
from
thereon
to
the
oral
argument,
i
think
to
the
oral
hearing
is
the
relevant
one.
and
if
you
look
at
that
reversal
rate,
there
are
1,101
workers
who
succeeded
at
the
oral
hearing,
having
lost
at
the
initial
stage
out
of
about
35,000
termination
decisions.
so
that
we
have
an
oral
hearing
that
cured
mistakes
at
a
3.3
reversal
rate
and
if
you
measure
that
against
all
determinations
concerning
disability
made
in
the
system
that
year,
about
150,000,
you
get
a
harmful
error
rate
of
7/10
of
1%.
now,
the
worker
who
receives,
who
wins
at
the
oral
evidentiary
hearing
or
indeed
the
reconsideration,
but
the
worker
who
wins
the
oral
evidentiary
hearing
stage
receives
all
his
back
payments.
now,
it
will
be
nice
to
say
i
suppose
that
the
system
must
be
perfect.
nobody
must
ever
be
terminated
no
matter
how
temporarily.
but
indeed,
i
do
not
think
any
legal
process
or
any
chemical
process
or
any
industrial
process
ever
can
afford
to
remove
the
last
bit
of
impurities
in
that
process
against
the
extraordinary
expensive,
indeed
up
against
the
defeat,
the
end
of
the
process.
i
cannot
put
for
approximate
dollar
cost
on
both
sides
of
this
due
process
equation
and
i
think
that
is
not
exactly
an
inhuman
thing
to
do
because
these
claimants
are
not
in
the
position
of
the
welfare
recipients
in
goldberg
against
kelly.
this
program
is
not
based
upon
need.
it
maybe
alternate
forms
of
income
in
the
family
or
to
the
worker
and
in
addition
if
there
is
a
worker
who
loses
his
disability
temporarily,
he
has
available
state,
local
and
other
forms
of
welfare.
so
that
we
are
not
--
that
puts
a
floor
under
his
income,
so
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
kind
of
stark
human
suffering
that
was
perceived
to
be
the
alternative
in
goldberg
against
kelly.
and
that
means
that
in
this
case,
i
think
the
dollar
amounts
are
real
proxy
for
the
interest
that
go
into
the
due
process
balance.
as
i
said,
11,101
workers,
one
reversal
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
calendar
'73.
now,
our
brief
is
a
little
misleading,
but
the
appendix
is
much
clear.
it
apparently
takes
10
to
11
months
to
get
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
after
the
initial
termination
and
part
of
that
time
--
part
of
that
average
time
is
clear
on
page
12(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
is
waiting
for
the
worker
to
asked
for
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
since
he
has
about
six
months
to
do
so,
but
it
is
163
days
as
the
median
time
from
request
for
an
oral
hearing
to
decision.
but
if
we
take
say
11
months
which
appears
to
be
roughly
as
the
period
of
time
that
worker
might
be
without
payments
and
there
are
11,101
workers,
it
turns
out
that,
since
we
are
dealing
with
the
stream
of
payments
so
that
only
half
of
the
payments
are
outstanding,
that
is
the
full
amount
he
ultimately
would
be
due
is
not
outstanding
all
the
time.
it
turns
out
that
there
must
have
been
total
payments
withheld
during
1973
that
were
later
said
to
be
due
to
workers
$2,028,000.00
or
an
average
of
$1,842.00
per
claimant.
now,
these
workers
recapture
that
money
at
the
end
of
the
period
so
that
they
did
not
lose
it.
what
they
did
lose
was
the
use
of
the
money
and
as
i
say
i
think
it
means
something
to
talk
about
that
because
these
people
do
have
alternative
welfare
systems
or
systems
that
deal
with
the
needy
or
often
their
forms
of
income,
they
lost
the
use
of
the
money
and
that
8%
interest
on
that
stream
of
monthly
payments
means
that
for
all
claimants
in
that
year
about
$162,000
or
$147.00
per
worker
was
lost.
now,
you
have
to
measure
that
of
course
against
a
cost
to
the
government.
hew
estimates
that
putting
in
full
evidentiary
hearings,
including
the
loss
of
$23
million
in
--
the
estimated
loss
of
$23
million
in
over
payments
that
cannot
be
covered,
some
of
them
maybe
recovered
and
they
estimate
the
total
cost
of
the
administrative
machinery
of
bureaucracy
and
the
lost
payments
to
be
between
$15
and
$25
million
annually
at
current
rates.
if
we
take
that,
take
the
median
figure
there
of
$20
million
cost
annually,
in
order
to
save
benefits
to
workers
of
a
163,000,
we
have
a
trade
off
in
costs
of
122
to
one
which
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
terribly
good
trade
off
and
it
may
be
low
because
it
does
not
really
take
account
i
think
of
the
full
scope
of
the
incentive
to
ask
for
evidentiary
hearing
to
keep
the
benefits
flowing.
but
i
think
it
does
not
make
a
great
deal
of
sense
in
due
process
terms
which
is
an
intensely
practical
subject
to
spend
a
$122.00
which
could
have
gone
to
other
recipients
to
save
$1.00
to
that
occasional
deserving
beneficiary.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
our
brief
contains
an
appendix
which
estimates
what
would
have
to
be
done
in
terms
of
manpower.
i
think
what
would
have
to
be
done
actually
is
to
create
for
the
first
time
hearing
procedures
either
in
the
state
agencies
or
in
the
local
social
security
offices
which
would
mean
an
extraordinary
proliferation
of
administrative
law
judges
and
an
extraordinary
call
upon
doctor’s
time
to
testify
at
these
hearings,
and
doctors
being
a
scarce
resource
i
think
is
part
of
the
equation
that
we
have
not
measured
in
dollar
terms,
but
it
is
a
real
part,
but
that
in
detail
i
think
is
found
in
the
appendices
here
mr.
chief
justice
and
how
they
make
their
estimate.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
after
that
the
judicial
review
which
is
the
first
review
which
is
not
de
novo.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
on
the
record.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
i
believe
i
do
mr.
justice
white
and
if
i
am
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
mean
at
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
administrative
oral
hearing?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
court
is
limited
by
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
i
think
in
no
previous
due
process
case
that
i
know
of
has
there
been
this
kind
of
a
ratio
of
cost
benefit,
in
fact
this
kind
of
a
disaster’s
ratio
of
cost
benefit.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
but
i
am
only
asking
that
there
not
be
a
pre-termination
here
mr.
justice
white.
but
in
any
event
for
the
jurisdictional
reason,
i
think
it
is
proper
for
the
case
to
be
--
the
judgment
to
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
with
instructions
to
dismiss
or
in
the
alternative
if
the
due
process
grounds
are
reached,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
