and
what
kind
of

get?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i

but
what
was
the
nature
of

j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
did
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
the
secretary

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
ask
that
he
produce
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
win
on
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
you
won?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
got
back
payments
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
next
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
you
got,
what
did
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
did
you
get
an
oral
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
happened
after
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
got
the
back
disability
payment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
it
was,
the
secretary
himself
after
the
second
oral
hearing,
reinstated
your
disability
benefits,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what
did
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
not
ask
for
reconsideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
happened
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
asked
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
that
because
meanwhile
you
filed
the
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understand
that
you
filed
suit
you
got
an
order
from
judge
turk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
government
appealed
that
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
this
obligate
you
asking
for
reconsideration,
the
fact
that
the
government
appealed
that
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
nothing
because
the
government
had
appealed
judge
turk’s
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
filed
suit
actually
before
the
second
reconsideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
second?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
never
got
reconsideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
the
reason
you
did
not
get
reconsideration
because
the
suit
was
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
precisely
what
order
of
judge
turk
did
they
advice
you
they
thought
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
on
the
ground
that
procedures
did
not
satisfy
the
standards
of
goldberg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let
me
see
what
that
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
means
as
you
described
it,
that
is
an
oral
hearing
at
which
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
claimant
and
his
lawyer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
said
i
think
earlier
that
this
claimant
had
lawyer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
you
would
be
satisfied
if
it
were
a
neighbor
or
union
representative
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
you
satisfied
just
to
look
at
the
medical
reports
rather
than
have
the
doctors
there
to
be
cross-examined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
not
asked
me
whether
you
insist
on
having
the
doctors
present?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
want
to
get
what
you
said.
you
are
satisfied
to
have
the
claimant
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
his
lawyer
if
he
wants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
satisfied
in
a
neighbor
and
members
of
the
family
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
testify
as
to
what
it
can
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
medical
records
that
are
used?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
the
medical
records?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
without
the
doctor
personally
present?
