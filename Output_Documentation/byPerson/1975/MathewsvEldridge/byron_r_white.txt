justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
he
can
present
whatever
evidence
he
wants
i
suppose,
but
he
apparently
is
not
entitled
to
have
any
witnesses
against
him
appear
personally?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
government
need
not
put
its
case
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
--
they
got
the
file
and
that
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
the
claimants
subpoena
the
doctors
and
cross-examine
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
can
call
them
for
cross-examination
or
what
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
validity
of
the
procedures
at
that
hearing
are
at
stake
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
was
just
where
there
needed
to
be
a
pre-hearing
a
prior
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
not
an
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
as
it
may
bear
on
whether
it
is
any
kind
of
a
reliable
substitute
for
a
pre-hearing
or
prior
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
supposed
the
administrative
remedies
are
completely
exhausted
then
i
suppose
at
some
point
there
is
judicial
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
that
is
on
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
it
is
true
that
--
it
is
true
that
--
you
think
however
that
if
he
wants
to
he
can
have
a
--
he
can
test
out
the
strength
of
the
government’s
case
through
live
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
as
assume
he
could
not,
assume
he
could
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
oral
hearing,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
administrative
oral
hearing
and
whatever
record
is
to
be
made
is
made
there
and
now
let
us
just
assume
he
cannot
test
up
the
government’s
case
by
confrontation
of
the
government’s
witnesses
or
the
sources
of
the
government’s
information,
assume
he
cannot
do
that,
neither
can
he
do
it
in
any
later
time.
in
court,
the
court
is
limited
to
the
record
this
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
argument
--
that
argument
is
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
what
is
your
(inaudible)?
have
they
terminated
you
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
and
you
have
divided
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
--
let
us
assume
that
the
present
evidentiary
hearing
that
is
supported
after
reconsideration
were
moved
up,
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
mean
the
content
and
the
opportunity
available
in
the
present
evidentiary
hearing
is
you
think
adequate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
have
the
power
of
subpoena?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
do
you
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i
just
ask
you
whether
you
have
the
power
of
subpoena
to
require
a
doctor
who
has
written
one
of
these
reports
to
attend
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
legally
speaking,
you
have
the
power
to
call
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
the
record
before
you,
you
can
call
the
doctor?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
answer
is
yes?
