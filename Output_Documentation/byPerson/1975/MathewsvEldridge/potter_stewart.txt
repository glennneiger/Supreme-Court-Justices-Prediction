justice
potter
stewart
i
am
asking
you
to
make
statements
against
interest,
but
will
you
sometime
tell
us
why
the
basis
for
your
original
conclusion?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
attacking
the
validity
of
the
very
process
under
which
it
could
proceed?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
the
issue,
it
is
whether
or
not
the
very
process,
the
administrative
process
is
a
valid
constitution
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
be
given
time?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
expensive
not
only
in
terms
of
money?
justice
potter
stewart
and
efficiency?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
are
those
new
procedures?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
earls
until
the
end
of
last
week
when
the
government
filed
its
supplementary
brief
you
had
no
reason
to
know
that
there
will
be
no
jurisdictional
question
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
for
one
would
be
interested
in
a
written
brief
from
you
on
that
issue
that
the
government
has
belatedly
brought
up.
