mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
basically
go
with
the
facts
that
i
do
not
think
mr.
bork
brought
out
in
detail
on
george
eldridge.
first
of
all,
mr.
eldridge
did
go
through
the
full
administrative
processes
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
justice
brennan
i
can,
i
am
familiar
with
the
salfi
case,
i
have
rated.
although
we
receive
the
government’s
final
brief
less
than
48
hours
ago
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
feel
as
far
as
jurisdiction
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
to
briefly
hit
the
jurisdiction
question,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
salfi
case
is
applicable
in
our
eldridge
case.
the
reasons
we
feel
is
as
follows.
in
salfi,
mrs.
salfi
was
trying
to
get
a
determination
that
she
was
entitled
to
benefits
through
the
district
court.
in
eldridge
we
are
not
concerned
with
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
george
eldridge
is
entitled
to
benefit.
judge
turk
in
his
district
court
opinion
and
the
government
in
their
brief
admit
that
this
is
not
a
case
determining
whether
or
not
george
eldridge
is
entitled
to
benefits.
certainly,
that
is
distinguishable
from
the
salfi
case
and
as
far
as
i
–-
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mt.
justice
rehnquist,
this
is
not,
the
district
judge
in
his
first
sentence
points
out
that
this
is
not
a
case
for
benefits.
the
government
in
their
own
briefs
have
said
this
is
not
a
case
for
benefits,
we
are
not
here
under
405.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
your
honor,
could
you
repeat
the
question
please?
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
had
--
mr.
george
eldridge
had
benefits
under
the
social
security.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
he
is
claiming
benefits
under
the
social
security
act,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
what
salfi
hailed.
however,
in
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
george
eldridge
case,
we
are
challenging
the
procedural
regulations
of
the
secretary.
we
are
not
asking
that
benefits
be
awarded.
we
are
challenging
merely
the
procedure
of
the
secretary
not
as
to
whether
or
not
george
eldridge
should
draw
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
your
honor,
we
did
go
out
in
the
administrative
process.
the
facts
basically
that
maybe
should
be
brought
out
is
that
initially
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir,
it
is
not
moot.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir,
we
are
drawing
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
sir?
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
your
honor,
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
be
termination
order.
you
mean
from
the
secretary?
mr.
donald
e.
earls
it
is
the
procedure
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
all
right,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
disability
recipient
should
be
given
an
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
terminating
the
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
we
do.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
secretary
did
terminate
mr.
eldridge’s
benefits.
the
district
court
reinstated
his
benefits
until
such
time
as
he
was
afforded
an
evidentiary
hearing
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
government
challenges
district
court
order.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
challenging
the
district
court
order
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeal
order
upholding
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
your
honor,
what
we
are
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
the
government’s
argument
mr.
justice
white.
our
contention
is
this,
that
by
being
terminated
--
by
our
benefits
being
terminated
prior
to
being
afforded
in
evidentiary
hearing,
we
were
denied
due
process.
we
went
twice
with
mr.
eldridge,
factually
speaking,
went
twice
through
an
administrative
hearing.
there
is
not
the
great
revamp
of
the
social
security
system
as
outlined
by
the
government
in
their
brief.
they
afford
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
after
a
reconsideration
determination.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
the
oral
evidentiary
hearing
be
moved
up.
in
other
words
that
the
individual
receive
his
benefits
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
have
been
terminated
twice.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
first
time
we
were
terminated
on
june
26
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
first
time
is
february
18,
1971
when
we
were
first
terminated.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
after
that
we
requested
a
reconsideration.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
it
was
unfavorable.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
it
is
a
paper
thing,
they
review
the
medical
evidence.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
next
we
went
to
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge
at
that
time
they
were
called
hearing
examiners.
the
hearing
examiner
gave
us
a
final,
favorable
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no,
that
is
not
true.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
the
first
time
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
is
where
the
claimant
and
his
attorney
may
sit
down
at
a
table
and
look
at
the
medical
evidence
which
the
secretary
has
concerning
the
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir.
practically
speaking,
we
do
not
cross-examine
medical
doctors
at
these
evidentiary
hearings.
this
is
the
time
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
we
did.
this
is
where
the
claimant,
his
neighbors,
his
wife
can
come
in
and
subjectively
tell
what
is
wrong.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
we
won.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
then
next,
the
secretary
sends
a
termination
letter
to
mr.
eldridge
advising
him
that
they
had
determined
that
he
is
no
longer
entitled
to
disability
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
then
requested
reconsideration.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
secretary’s
holding
was
upheld.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
secretary
in
their
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
were
awarded
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
true.
well,
in
the
meantime
before
our
second
hearing,
the
district
judge
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
requiring
the
secretary
to
continue
payments
until
we
received
that
hearing.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
have
two—
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
alright.
then,
after
one
year,
again
mr.
eldridge
receives
a
termination
letter
from
the
secretary
advising
him
that
they
have
determined
that
he
is
no
longer
entitled
to
disability
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
government
if
you
will
notice
on
the
government’s
appendix
in
the
fourth
circuit
brief
for
the
appellant
in
the
fourth
circuit
informed
us
that
they
determined
that
judge
turk’s
order
to
be
final
and
appealable
and
the
government
appealed
and
we
have
not
been
reconsidered.
we
have
not
been
offered
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
cannot
ask
for
a
hearing
until
after
we
have
had
reconsideration.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
had
already
asked
for
reconsideration.
the
secretary
did
nothing.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
i
do
not
know
why
they
did
not.
they
just
did
not
act
upon
our
request.
now,
i
think
george
eldridge
case
points
out
the
fairness
of
the
oral
evidentiary
hearings.
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
many
practically
speaking
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir
we
did.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
government
reconsiders.
we
do
not
reconsider.
we
requested
reconsideration.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
were
never
given
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
secretary
has
never
told
us
why
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
now,
we
requested
reconsideration.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
they
appealed
as
on
page
16(a)
of
their
appendix
in
the
fourth
circuit
is
the
letter
advising
me
that
they
are
appealing
that
they
consider
judge
turk’s
order
final
and
appealable.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
judge
turk
issued
an
order
requiring
the
secretary
to
continue
disability
benefits
to
george
eldridge
until
after
he
had
been
afforded
an
evidentiary
hearing
under
the
standards
of
goldberg
versus
kelly.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
well,
twice
when
george
eldridge
met
before
an
individual
rather
through
the
mails,
twice
he
was
given
benefits
by
the
secretary’s
own
representative
that
is
a
hearing
before
--
when
he
had
his
oral
evidentiary
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge
or
hearing
examiner.
judge
turk
had
no
problem
at
all
awarding
him
benefits
until
he
had
received
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing.
and
i
think
these
points
out
the
unfairness
of
terminating
the
benefits
prior
to
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing.
in
this
particular
case,
george
eldridge
had
his
home
foreclosed.
he
and
his
six
children
were
sleeping
in
one
bed
because
all
of
their
furniture
had
been
repossessed
and
yet
the
secretary
says,
in
his
argument
today
that
there
is
some
delay
of
160
days
from
request
for
hearing
until
termination.
by
their
own
figures,
in
their
reply
and
supplemental
brief,
on
page
14,
their
figures
show
that
indeed
roughly
58%,
58.6%
of
those
cases
that
go
before
--
that
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
are
reversed.
that
means
that
there
are
58.6
individuals
who
are
entitled
to
disability
benefits
who
have
their
disability
benefits
terminated
wrongfully.
figure-wise
this
is
1100.
so
doing
a
little
subtraction,
we
have
approximately
600
people
drawing
benefits
that
should
not.
our
main
contention
is
that
the
evidentiary
hearings
should
be
moved
up
before
benefits
are
terminated.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir
it
would.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
it
would
not
change
anything
at
all.
they
already
allow
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
justice
white,
the
figures
the
secretary
gives
you,
yes
sir,
absolutely.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
it
is
timing.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
claimant
is
present.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
possibly,
his
lawyer
or
a
neighbor.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
anyone
he
wants
to
tell
you?
mr.
donald
e.
earls
your
honor
in
the
case
of
underwood
versus
redicle,
the
fourth
circuit
has
hailed
that
main
element
in
determining
benefits
is
not
the
objective
co-medical
record
as
a
secretary
sees,
but
they
say
that
subject
if
evidence
such
as
the
claimant's
appearance
before
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
testimony
of
the
claimant,
his
wife,
and
neighbors
as
to
his
ability
to
work
and
in
many
of
this
cases
and
george
eldridge
is
a
very
good
example,
you
can
look
at
him
and
tell
he
is
disabled.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no,
your
honor
we
did
not
insist
upon
having
the
doctors
present,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
and
the
medical
records
that
are
used
against
him.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
or
form?
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
there
would
be
no
need
in
having
the
doctors
there.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
not
really
the
issue
here.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
by
way
of
cross-examination
to
medical
doctors,
if
you
start
subpoenaing
doctors,
you
can
never
get
one
to
examine
a
disability
claimant.
i
mean,
there
is
not
enough
money
in
the
program
for
it.
if
a
doctor
is
--
if
you
do
feel
a
doctor
is
antagonistic
he
could
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes
sir,
i
believe
you
do,
practically
speaking
i
have
never
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
yes,
you
do.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
at
the
oral
evidentiary
hearing
is
the
first
time
that
you
can
see
the
record
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
the
statistics
that
the
secretary
provided
to
you
point
out
that
the
co-medical
record
is
in
error
58%
of
the
time.
in
other
words
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
in
other
words
according
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
according
to
their
records,
after
an
initial
determination
is
made,
that
is
accepted
by
24,800,
roughly
25,000
of
the
persons
who
had
been
drawing
disability
payments
and
are
cut
off.
so
it
is
accepted
roughly
by
25,000
people
and
this
is
explainable.
you
have
25,000
people
who
are
involved
in
industrial
accidents
and
for
some
reason
or
another
are
drawing
disability
benefits.
when
they
recover
or
when
they
are
able
to
go
back
to
work
then,
they
certainly
would
not
contest
that
they
may
now
be
gainfully
employed
and
should
be
terminated.
of
these,
then
you
have
8,700
remaining
who
may
request
reconsideration.
of
those
that
do,
5,700
except
the
unfavorable
the
termination
after
reconsideration,
that
leaves
1,100
people
for
hearing,
i
am
sorry
1,800
people
for
hearing
and
of
those
1,100
went
out
after
the
hearing.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
because
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
have
25,000
people
who
realize
that
they
are
no
longer
disabled
and
do
not
contest
the
determination.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir
because
you
can
also
terminate
benefits
based
upon
the
work
record.
if
an
individual
returns
to
work,
then
of
course
these
disability
benefits
will
cease.
he
may
call
up
to
the
district
office
and
say
i
am
going
back
to
work.
i
do
not
want
your
benefits.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
possibly
the
secretary
could
provide
that.
i
do
not
have
those
figures
available.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
realistically
speaking,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
such
as
industrial
accidents,
recovery
from
injuries
and
this
sort
of
thing.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no,
your
honor
there
is
none.
but
we
do
want
to
point
out
that
george
eldridge
twice
went
through
the
adversarial
hearing
and
was
twice
awarded
benefits
after
this.
we
are
not
asking
for
any
great
reshuffling,
any
hiring.
what
we
are
asking
is
that
the
hearing
which
has
afforded
him
be
moved
up
prior
to
the
termination
of
benefits.
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
unreasonable
burden
and
certainly
58%
of
the
time,
what
we
are
doing
we
are
sacrificing
58%
of
the
people
that
are
entitled
to
the
benefits,
to
the
42%
that
are
not.
the
secretary
has
said
that
disability
benefits
are
not
based
upon
need.
the
statement
was
made
from
the
stand
today.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
page
28
of
the
government’s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
their
first
sentence
in
the
secretary’s
manual
states
that
most
people
who
get
a
social
security
check,
depend
on
it
for
the
necessities
of
life
and
this
is
certainly
the
case
in
george
eldridge
here,
an
individual
who
has
paid
into
a
system
such
as
social
security
must
forfeit
in
many
jurisdictions
or
at
least
submit
to
a
lien
for
any
welfare
benefits
which
he
may
draw
and
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
well,
the
secretary’s
figures
point
out
that
90%
of
the
total
beneficiary
population
earn
nothing.
so,
i
would
say
that
as
opposed
to
need
--
as
opposed
to
goldberg
versus
kelly
in
need,
they
are
indistinguishable.
i
feel
in
the
george
eldridge
case
where
mr.
eldridge
was
required
to
sleep
in
one
bed
with
five
children
lost
his
home
that
he
had
worked
all
his
life
for
as
a
labor
on
a
railroad
and
then
as
a
soda
distributor,
driving
a
truck
in
carrying
cases
of
soda
pop,
then
certainly,
he
lost
everything
which
could
not
be
recouped
after
the
--
in
other
words,
he
cannot
go
buy
his
house
back
once
it
has
been
foreclosed
and
this
is
what
happened
in
the
george
eldridge
case
and
this
is
what
happens
in
many
of
the
cases.
in
58%
of
the
cases,
it
may
happen
because
in
58%
of
the
cases
that
go
to
hearing,
they
are
reversed.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
true,
yes
sir.
he
would
have
had
some
money.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir,
he
would
not
have
enough
money,
enough
income
of
any
kind
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
my
point
is,
if
he
had
been
continued
on
benefits
prior
to
terminating,
those
benefit
payments
would
have
kept
his
house
payments
up.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
no
sir,
he
would
not
have.
he
would
have
had
money
to
make
house
payments.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
the
record
in
the
district
court
or
the
transcript
of
the
record
of
the
district
court
should
show
it.
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
as
to
need?
mr.
donald
e.
earls
we
were
not
pursuing
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
mr.
eldridge
is
entitled
to
benefits
in
the
district
court.
we
were
merely
challenging
the
procedures
employed
by
the
secretary
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
reversal
rates
now
after
hearing
are
greater
than
those
reversal
rights
prior
to
the
decision
in
wright
versus
richardson.
in
the
--
mr.
donald
e.
earls
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
reason
we
are
here
is
that
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
george
eldridge’s
due
process
rights
to
terminate
his
benefits,
his
disability
benefits
prior
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
district
judge
turk
was
upheld
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
government
chose
to
appeal
it
and
to
apply
for
a
certiorari
to
this
court
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
we
do
not
question
the
constitutionality
of
any
hearings.
we
are
just
saying
that
the
money
should
not
stop
prior
to
an
evidentiary
hearing.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
mr.
eldridge's
arguments.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
i
would
be
happy
to
do
so
and
i
would
like
approximately
ten
days
to
prepare
one.
mr.
donald
e.
earls
alright
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
