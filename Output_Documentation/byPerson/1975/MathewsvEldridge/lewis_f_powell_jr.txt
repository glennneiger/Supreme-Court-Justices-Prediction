justice

powell,

mr.
solicitor
general,
you
referred
to
the
right
of
the
worker
to
examine
the
file.
i
recall
i
believe
something
in
the
briefs
to
the
effect
that
the
worker
himself
could
not
see
the
medical
evidence
in
the
file
by
his
counsel
could?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
is
the
reason
for
that
distinction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
this
distinction
in
the
regulation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
this
means
that
a
claimant
who
does
not
have
counsel
does
not
have
access
to
that
medical
information?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

justice

f.
powell,

this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
it
presents
a
question
of
what
process
is
due
when
disability
benefits
are
terminated.
under
the
social
security
act,
a
worker,
receiving
such
benefits,
has
a
burden
of
showing
continuous
disability.
when
disability
is
put
in
issue,
as
it
was
with
respect
to
respondent,
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
hew
prescribed
an
elaborate
administrative
review
procedure,
but
this
procedure
does
not
include
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
prior
to
termination
of
benefits.
respondent,
in
this
case,
challenged
the
validity
of
the
procedure
by
suit
in
the
federal
district
court.
that
court,
relying
on
this
courtâ€™s
decision
in
goldberg
against
kelly,
held
that
such
a
hearing
was
constitutionally
required.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
decision
whether
to
discontinue
disability
benefits
normally
turns
upon
documented
medical
evidence.
the
issue
of
disability
is
a
focused
and
limited
one.
prior
to
termination
of
benefits,
the
claimant
is
given
access
to
government
trials
and
to
the
reasons
for
the
tentative
decision
to
discontinue.
the
claimant
also
is
afforded
an
opportunity
to
submit
additional
evidence
and
arguments.
following
discontinuance
of
benefits,
there
is
a
right
to
an
oral
evidentiary
hearing
and
ultimately
to
judicial
review
before
the
denial
becomes
final.
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
and
a
carefully
structured
system
for
administrative
review,
we
find
no
deprivation
of
procedural
due
process.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
