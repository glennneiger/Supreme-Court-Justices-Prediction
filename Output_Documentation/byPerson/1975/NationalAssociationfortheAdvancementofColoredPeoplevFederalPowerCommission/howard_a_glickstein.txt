mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fpc’s
position
in
this
case
appears
to
be
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
do
what
is
easy
and
lacks
jurisdiction
to
undertake
what
is
difficult.
the
fpc
seems
to
have
converted
and
alleged
burden
into
a
jurisdictional
barrier.
but
the
fpc
appears
to
contend
is
that
after
employment
discrimination
has
produced
costly
consequences
after
the
costs
of
the
employment
discrimination
have
been
assessed
by
some
other
agency,
then
and
only
then
is
it
proper
for
the
fpc
to
disallow
such
cost
in
a
ratemaking
proceeding.
this
is
the
limited
extent
to
which
the
fpc
recognizes
any
relationship
between
a
duty
to
eliminate
employment
discrimination—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
federal
power
commission
refused
to
disallow
a
specific
cost
and
against
the
utility
in
a
ratemaking
proceeding
for
example—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
we
concede
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
are
remedies
before
the
equal
employment
commission.
there
are
remedies
under
1981.
we
do
contend
however
that
the
costs
of
employment
discrimination
are
a
very
relevant
factor
for
the
fpc
to
consider
and
not
to
consider
it
merely
after
the
costs
have
been
assessed
by
some
other
--
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that,
the
fpc
had
jurisdiction
in
this
area
and
a
particular
rate
was
challenged
as
including
cost
that
related
to
employment
discrimination.
if
a
particular
license
was
challenged
as
being
applied
for
by
a
company
that
had
a
record
of
employment
discrimination.
and
the
fpc
refused
to
take
that
into
account
or
discounted
it
then
that
would
be
an
additional
proceeding
in
which
an
appeal
would
be
taken
from
the
fpc’s
conclusion
on
that
score.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
yes,
they
may,
they
certainly
may.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
there
are
multiple
remedies
available
for
victims
of
discrimination.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
i
think
they
would
have
the
power
to
disallow
cost
related
to
the
fact,
--
in
addition
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
not
merely
in
the
ratemaking
proceeding
where
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
this
question.
it
is
also
in
licensing
and
certificating
proceedings.
and
there
if
a
company
is
shown
to
be
a
known
discriminator
and
that
perhaps
is
a
competing
company
for
the
license
that
is
not,
that
is
a
factor
we
contend
that
federal
power
commission
could
into
account.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
we
are
barred
your
honor
because
the
fpc
has
prohibited
the
raising
of
such
an
issue
in
the
licensing
proceeding.
yes,
we
cite
the
case
on
page
47,
i
believe
of
our
brief.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
in
both
the
federal
power
commission
has
barred
the
raising
of
such
issues.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
i
think
the
factors
that
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
would
be
considering
in
granting
a
license
for
a
nuclear
regulatory
plant
would
be
somewhat
different
than
the
factors
of
the
federal
power
commission
considers
when
it
grants
licenses
of
set
rates,
to
the
extent
that
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
the
authority
to
consider
whether
or
not
consumers
are
being
exploited,
whether
or
not
unjust
and
unreasonable
costs
are
being
passed
on
then
i
suspect
it
would
apply.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
mr.
chief
justice,
the
icc
has
published
a
notice
of
rulemaking
and
we
have
the
same
problem.
they
have
not
done
anything
about
this.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
no.
they
do
not
have
a
rule
against
us.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
the
fcc
is
the
only
one
of
the
two
federal
regulatory
agencies
that
has
issued
a
rule
prohibiting
employment
discrimination
by
its
regualitives.
the
fcc
does
have
such
a
rule.
the
fcc,
federal
communications
commission.
i
think
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board,
i
believe
has
issued
a
similar
rule.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
no,
the
sec
has
not
issued
such
a
rule.
as
the
solicitor
general
indicated
in
his
amicus
brief
in
this
case,
the
number
of
the
federal
regulatory
agencies
apparently
are
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding
before
they
determine
what
they
should
do.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
one
cost
mr.
justice
brennan
that
i
guess
is
readily
assessable
is
of
course
the
back
pay
award.
and
mr.
journey
told
you
that
under
the
uniform
systems
of
accounts,
this
would
be
treated
as
penalties.
first
of
all
i
am
somewhat
puzzled
by
that
because
the
uniform
system
of
accounts
is
just
that.
it
is
a
system
of
accounts
that
tells
utilities
how
to
keep
their
books.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
and
one
such
cost
would
be
a
back
pay
award.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
we
would
not
–
that
we
would
not
allow
or
we
would
urge
to
the
fpc
not
to
take
the
back
pay
award
that
the
utility
had
to
payout
into
account
in
setting
its
rate.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
the
interest
that
our
clients
have
is
in
the
overall
question
of
the
discrimination
by—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
have
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
it
is
no
longer
necessary
to
award
back
pay
under
title
vii
because
the
problem
of
that
statute
is
directed
to
what
is
eliminated.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
our
request
in
this
case
is
that
if
the
labor
force
is
used
more
efficiently,
if
persons
regardless
of
sex
or
race
are
permitted
just
to
obtain
employment
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
that
to
be
back
pay
awards.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
i
certainly
concede
mr.
justice
stevens
that
some
companies
make
that
contention.
i
believe
that
is
a
rather
short-ranged
point
of
view.
i
think
that
the
testimony
of
economist
is
quite
clear
that
in
the
long
run
the
elimination
of
employment
discrimination
is
economically
efficient.
for
that
very
purpose
that
congress
passed
title
vii.
it
concluded
that
employment
discrimination
raised
a
great
cost
and
burden
to
the
state
commerce.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
mr.
justice
white,
we
are
urging
that
the
fpc
and
now
the
purpose
of
our
rulemaking
proceeding
was
to
have
the
fpc
to
take
preventive
steps
to
issue
a
prophylactic
rule
to
prevent
these
cost
from
arising.
to
prevent
it
being
necessary
to—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
it
was
not
ordered
to
undertake
a
rulemaking
proceeding
but
judge
mcgowan
(ph)
indicated
some
aspects
of
the
rule
that
we
were
proposing
that
it
might
be
appropriate
for
the
fpc
to
adopt.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
they
were
not
required
to
hold
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
correct.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
in
addition
to
back
pay.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
there
are
litigation
costs
that
would
be
disallowed.
in
addition
to
that
there
are
as
judge
mcgowan
(ph)
indicated
some
unquantifiable
costs.
and
it
might
well
be
that
the
fpc
could
conclude
that
a
company
that
engages
in
employment
discrimination
is
operating
less
efficiently
than
another
company.
and
it
might
take
that
into
account
in
setting
the
rate.
we
quote
in
our
brief,
a
letter
from
the
administrator
of
the
general
services
administration
that
deals
with
ratemaking
–
with
the
utilities
that
the
federal
government
deals
with.
and
he
says
it
on
page
27
of
our
brief
was,
since
such
practices
most
certainly
effect
the
utilities
overall
deficiency
the
rate
of
return
granted
to
the
utility
would
be
established
at
the
lower
end
of
the
zone
of
reasonableness.
so
we
do
say
if
the
federal
power
commission
were
to
find
that
a
company
was
a
repeated
discriminator
that
it
could
take
that—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
something
of
that
sort,
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
would
be
a
factor
that
taken
to
account
in
determining
the
rate
of
return
that
the—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
that
would
be
one
method
of
proceeding
when
there
are
unquantifiable
costs.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
that
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
would
be
a
cost
that
was
incurred
in
furthering
a
very
basic
national
policy.
i
think
that
would
be
very
similar
to
a
utility
arguing
that
what
it
had
to
do
to
eliminate
some
environmental
dangers
was
very
costly
and
that
expense
was
challenged.
i
think
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
were
writing
the
opinion
for
the
federal
power
commission,
i
would
say
that
this
cost
is
a
necessary
element
in
overcoming
the
effects
of
past
discrimination,
it
is
a
short-range
expenditure.
once
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
are
overcome,
this
company
will
ultimately
operate
much
more
efficiently
and
whatever
costs
were
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
affirmative
action
plan.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well
i—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
i
would
not
be
speculating
mr.
chief
justice.
again,
i
think
that
the
factors
that
go
into
the
economics
of
discrimination
have
been
studied
and
the
counsel
of
economic
advisers
for
example
estimated
some
years
ago
that
if
employment
discrimination
were
eliminated
from
our
economy
the
gross
national
product
would
increase
by
$20
billion.
discrimination
is
inefficient.
it
might
cost
something
to
eliminate
it
initially
but
in
the
long
run,
when
it
is
eliminated,
there
will
be
benefits
as
a
result
of
it.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
and
the
federal
power
commission
has
acted
on
jurisdictional
grounds
in
rejecting
that
instead
of
holding
some
sort
of
proceeding
and
asking
the
question
of
what
sort
of
costs
are
feasible
t
deal
with
and
what
sort
of
cost
are
not
feasible
to
deal
with.
perhaps
there
are
some
costs
that
are
so
difficult
to
quantify
that
they
could
not
deal
with.
on
the
other
hand
there
are
not
probably
some
costs
that
they
can
deal
with.
they
have
not
considered
that.
they
have
not
given
us
a
reasoned
response
to
why
this
is
not
the
feasible
function
for
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
prefer
a
rulemaking
proceeding
and
i
think
that
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
federal
power
commission.
one
of
the
concerns,
it
has
is
that
what
we
have
proposed
would
present
the
great
burden
because
they
would
have
to
consider
these
questions
in
a
case-by-case
basis.
but
they
do
not
want
to
that,
they
have
a
rulemaking
proceeding
and
state
what
their
policy
is.
in
addition,
mr.
journey
today
says
that
back
pay
awards
are
penalties.
that
is
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
back
pay
award
as
defined
as
a
penalty.
back
pay
awards
are
equitable
remedies.
so
this
court
is,
they
said
they
are
and
for
the
gas
and
electric
utility
industry
to
be
suddenly
told
in
a
brief
to
the
supreme
court
that
in
the
future
back
pay
awards
are
going
to
be
treated
as
penalties
is
a
rather
unusual
way
to
make
new
policy.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
albemarle
case,
you
refered
to
the
back
pay
awards,
equitable
remedies.
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
federal
power
commission
case
where
it
held
back
pay
awards
would
be
a
penalty.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
it
is
certainly
not
clear
from
their
system
of
accounts
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
pardon
me.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
i
do
not
know
whether
that
has
been
the
practice,
whether
i—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
in
the
un-uniformed
system
of
accounts
it
indicates
that
something
that
is
listed
as
a
penalty
might
be
treated
otherwise
in
a
ratemaking
proceeding.
and
i
assume
that
a
company
would
be
able
to
argue
that
the
reason
that
incurred
this
back
pay
award
was
because
it
was
conducting
itself
in
good
faith
in
some
particular
situation
and
it
should
not
be
disallowed.
i
do
not
believe
that
under
the
uniformed
system
of
accounts
is
that
clear.
the
uniform
system
of
account
is
analogous
to
your
tax
return
where
the
internal
revenue
service
tells
where
to
list
something.
and
merely
because
you
list
something
under
contributions
does
not
necessary
mean
that
that
is
the
way
they
are
going
to
treat
it
when
they
review
your
return.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
yes,
i
would.
i
would
say
that
kind
of
back
pay
should
be
subtracted
from
the
rate
base.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
in
that
particular
case,
we
would
ask
the
commission
to
perhaps,
condition
the
rate
increase
on
the
utility
undertaking
a
program
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
discriminatory
practices
and
its
promotion
procedures.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
i
think
that
there
is
an
instance
where
it
would
be
desirable
for
the
power
commission
to
have
some
rules
in
advance.
so
they
might
indicate
in
the
rules
under
what
circumstances
they
will
take
allegations
of
discriminatory
practices
into
account.
for
example,
if
the
practice
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
a
proceeding
before
the
federal
power
commission,
the
federal
power
commission
might
suggest
that
we
would
like
to
have
the
expertise
of
the
equal
employment
commission
on
this
issue.
the
federal
power
commission
might
decide
that
if
reasonable
cause
findings
have
been
made
by
the
equal
employment
commission
in
cases
then
it
will
consider
charges
of
discrimination
in
proceedings
before
it.
it
might
decide
that
if
there
has
been
a
judicial
finding
in
some
instance
then
it
will
consider
these
issues
when
the
proceeding
is
before
it.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
i
think
it
could
condition
the
rate
increases
and
condition
the
granting
of
licenses
and
certificates
on
certain
types
of
performance.
i
think
that
under
circumstances
the
federal
power
commission
could
order
something
directly.
for
example,
if
it
desired
that
every
regulatee
submit
periodic
reports
indicating
what
his
employment
practices
were.
it
could
order
something
like
that
directly.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
i
would
say
that
the
company
that
you
are
referring
to
was
faced
with
the
possibility
of
substantial
cost
as
a
result
of
putting
people
in
their
rightful
place.
and
therefore
the
power
commission
should
definitely
condition
the
rate
increase
on
the
curing
of
that
situation
and
not
allow
the
cost
that
are
incurred
by
making
up
for
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
rate.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
yes.
and
the
fpc
would
do
not
that.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
the
fpc
would
not
have
the
power
to
order
a
particular
employee
to
be
promoted
or
reinstated.
the
equal
employment
commission
would
or
the
federal
court
would
or
a
state
–
the
human
rights
commission
would—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
i
think
the
federal
power
commission
could
await
the
resolution
of
the
problem
you
suggest
by
another
agency
if
they
were
--
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
it
might.
and
the—
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
the
rate
increases,
there
is
a
lot
to
go
into
effect
and
the
rate
increase
would
be
in
effect
subject
to
refund.
and
if
it
turned
out
that
there
were
no
cost
to
related
to
this
so
there
would
not
be
any
refunds
involved.
if
there
were
costs
related
to
this,
there
would
be
some
refunds.
the
fpc
can
only
suspend
a
rate
increase
for
five
months
and
generally
it
does
it
for
just
a
few
days.
and
the
cost
–
and
the
new
rates
are
allowed
to
go
into
effect.
so
the
utility
would
be
able
to
get
its
increased
rate.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
again,
i
think
that
because
of
the
greater
expertise
of
the
equal
employment
commission
the
federal
power
commission
might
defer
to
their
expertise
and
condition
whatever
a
question
was
before
it
on
the
outcome
of
eeoc
proceeding.
if
it
were
a
licensing
question
they
would
grant
the
license
on
condition
that
whatever
remedy
is
ordered
by
the
eeoc
be
expeditiously
complied
with.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
fpc
has
suggested
that
a
lot
of
these
fears
that
it
would
have
to
cut
off
the
licenses,
the
dams
and
shut
off
power
plants
and
so
forth.
that
is
not
the
only
remedy
at
their
disposal.
if
appropriate
rules
are
issued
and
a
utility
does
not
comply,
they
can
seek
court
relief.
they
do
not
have
to
take
the
license
away
from
the
hydroelectric
plant
if
they
fail
to
comply.
there
are
other
remedies
under
the
federal
power
act
that
would
be
available.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
the
federal
power
commission
would
perhaps
be
the
ultimate
weapon
that
the
federal
power
commission,
if
it
conditioned
the
license
of
this
hydroelectric
dam
on
the
accomplishment
of
whatever
was
ordered
by
the
eeoc.
i
think
that
would
impose
on
the
hydroelectric
dam,
a
sufficient
degree
of
pressure
that
it
would
comply
with
the
eeoc
order.
mr.
howard
a.
glickstein
well,
i
think
the
fpc
could
undertake
a
civil
action
and
get
an
injunction
requiring
the
company
to
comply
and
for
example
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
for
some
cases
where
utilities
at
a
government
contractors
fail
to
comply
with
the
government
contract
provisions
and
the
federal
government
is
not
going
to
terminate
its
contract
with
the
utility,
it
needs
a
power.
and
it
went
to
court
and
sued
to
get
the
compliance
with
that
provision.
more
is
involved
in
this
case
than
the
fpc’s
responsibility
however
to
protect
consumers
and
to
ensure
the
health
of
the
gas
and
electric
utility
industry.
ten
years
before
this
court
decided
the
brown
case
and
steele
v.
louisville
&
nashville
railroad,
the
1926
railway
labor
act
was
interpreted
to
prohibit
their
railroad
employees
from
being
subjected
to
racial
discrimination.
repeatedly,
this
court
has
recognized
the
critical
importance
of
employment
and
has
endorsed
the
most
effective
remedies
with
dealing
employment
discrimination.
we
contend
that
in
this
case,
that
it
is
a
highly
consistent
with
the
federal
power
commission’s
proper
regulatory
role
that
it
too
be
required
to
take
steps
to
deal
with
illegal
employment
discrimination.
thank
you.
