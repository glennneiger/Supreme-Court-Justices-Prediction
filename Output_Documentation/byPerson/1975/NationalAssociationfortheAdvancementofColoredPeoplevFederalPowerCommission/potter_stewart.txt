justice
potter
stewart
pursuing
my
brother
white’s
inquiry
a
little
bit,
let
us
say
a
costumer
comes
in
and
says
some
of
this
cause
are
forbidden
by
law
because
they
were
bribes,
they
were
bribes
of
municipal
officials.
are
you
suggesting
that
you
–
your
commission
would
not
and
could
not
consider
that
until
or
unless
the
courts
had
convicted
somebody
of
bribery?
justice
potter
stewart
we
were
told
that
at
least
they
are
disallowed
that
double
payments
for
the
same
employment
were
disallowed
that
one
of
the
payments
was
disallowed,
that
sort
of
back
pay
would
be,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
we
were
told
by
that
counsel
as
i
understood
him,
that
standard
operating
procedure
for
their
accounts
when
they
go
into
a
utilities
office.
and
you
take
issue
over
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
has
been
suggested.
it
has
been
suggested
here
today,
on
oral
argument
for
example
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
means
or
can
be
read
to
mean
that
you
not
only
can
but
should
say
to
a
utility,
you
cannot
have
any
increase,
rate
increase
at
all,
regardless
of
your
legitimate
increase
in
cost,
you
cannot
have
any
rate
increase
at
all
until
or
unless
you
clean
up
your
discriminatory
employment
practices.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
what
you
object
to.
justice
potter
stewart
this
cases
are
here
by
way
of
the
grant
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
issue
is
to
one
what
extent
if
any
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
performance
of
its
function
under
the
federal
power
act
and
the
natural
gas
act
has
authority
to
prohibit
discriminatory
employment
practices
on
the
part
of
the
companies
that
it
regulates.
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
and
several
other
organizations,
petitioned
the
commission
to
issue
a
rule,
requiring
equal
employment
opportunity
and
non-discrimination
in
the
employment
practices
of
its
regulatees.
proposed
rule
would
have
required
the
regulated
companies
to
adopt
affirmative
action
programs
to
combat
discrimination
and
employment
and
would
have
given
any
person
who
believed
himself
to
have
been
subjected
to
employment
discrimination
by
any
such
company.
the
right
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
commission.
the
commission
refused
to
adopted
the
proposed
rule,
holding
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
do
so,
because
the
only
purposes
of
the
natural
gas
and
federal
power
acts
are
economic
regulation
of
entrepreneurs
engaged
in
energy
and
resource
development.
on
petition
for
review
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
agreed
that
the
commission
was
without
power
to
prescribe
personal
practices
in
detail
and
to
receive
complaints,
adjudicate
them
and
punish
directly
in
fractions
to
those
practices.
but
the
court
held
that
the
commission
does
have
power
to
take
into
account
in
the
performance
of
its
regulatory
functions
including
licensing
and
rate
review,
evidence
that
the
regulatee
is
a
demonstrated
discriminator
in
its
employment
relations.
both
the
commission
and
the
naacp
petitioned
for
certiorari
and
we
granted
both
petitions
in
order
to
consider
the
scope
of
the
commission's
authority
to
deal
with
discriminatory
employment
practices
on
the
part
of
the
companies
that
it
regulates.
the
question
presented
is
not
whether
the
elimination
of
discrimination
from
our
society
is
an
important
national
goal,
it
clearly
is.
the
question
is
not
whether
congress
could
authorize
the
federal
power
commission
to
combat
such
discrimination,
it
clearly
could.
the
question
is
simply
whether
or
to
what
extent
congress
did
grant
the
commission
such
authority.
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
federal
power
commission
is
authorized
to
consider
the
consequences
of
discriminatory
employment
practices
on
the
part
of
its
regulatees
but
only
insofar
as
such
consequences
are
directly
related
to
the
commission's
establishment
of
just
and
reasonable
rates,
in
the
public
interest.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
justice
marshall
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
