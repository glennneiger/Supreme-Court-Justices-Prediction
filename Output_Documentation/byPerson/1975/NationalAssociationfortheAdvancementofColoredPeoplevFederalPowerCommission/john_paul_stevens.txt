question
i
should
think
your
position
would
be
one
that
would
aided
by
encouraging
back
pay
awards
rather
than
penalizing
them.
i
am
just
wondering
if
you
are
representing
the
best
interest
of
your
client.

the
irony
of
this
case
as
it
strikes
me
is
that
so
often
in
the
employment
discrimination
field,
it
is
the
company
that
is
defending
on
the
ground
that
if
we
were
to
comply
it
would
be
very
costly.
and
here
we
are
suggesting
that
compliance,
we
are
just
suggesting
just
the
opposite.
