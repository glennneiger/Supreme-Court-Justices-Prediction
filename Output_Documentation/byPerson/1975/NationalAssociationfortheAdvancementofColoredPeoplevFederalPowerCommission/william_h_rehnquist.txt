justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
journey,
your
statement
at
what
you
now
require
from
this
court
is
such
and
such
raises
a
question
in
my
mind
that
bothered
me
while
reading
the
briefs
and
bothering
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
certain
abstractness
about
the
question
that
is
presented
here.
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
standing
or
a
case
or
controversy
or
rightness.
but
obviously
this
court
does
not
just
respond
to
the
request
of
both
parties
to
tell
us,
to
tell
you
what
you
can
do
and
what
cannot
do.
you
have
got
to
show
that
you
have
got
a
concrete
controversy.
and
i
am
somewhat
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
this
was
not
any
specific
attack
on
a
rate
hearing
or
license
application
but
simply
a
request
for
a
rule
and
the
fpc
turned
it
down
because
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
customer
comes
in
a
rate
proceeding
mr.
journey
and
says
the
utility
defended
a
lawsuit
and
then
paid
$350,000.00
in
lawyer’s
fee
and
we
do
not
think
it
should
have
defended
that
lawsuit.
we
think
it
should
have
just
capitulated.
now
would
the
fpc
inquire
in
that
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
utility
should
have
defended
the
action
on
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
utility
shows
that
it
followed
the
advice
of
a
lawyer
in
deciding
to
defend
the
action
and
there
is
no
question
about
the
size
of
the
fee.
the
customer’s
complaint
is
that
the
lawyer's
advice
was
wrong,
you
should
not
have
defended
the
action,
you
really
had
no
defense,
you
should
have
settled
it
and
avoid
this
cost
and
therefore
take
the
cost
out
of
the
rate
base.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
standard
do
you
apply
in
disallowing
those
--
.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
be
satisfied
with
the
reasoned
response
on
an
ad
hoc
case-by-case
basis
as
the
court
of
appeals
intimated
would
be
permissible
or
would
you
insist
that
it
would
be
an
actual
rule
making
legislative
type
hearing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
it
were
found
in
a
back
pay
proceeding
like
the
one
that
the
court
--
this
court
said
in
the
albermarle,
last
year
that
the
employer
had
been
acting
in
good
faith
but
that
was
not
sufficient
to
award
off
a
back
pay
award.
now,
would
you
say
that
that
kind
of
back
pay
award
should
be
subtracted
from
the
rate
base?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
do
you
do
by
way
of
implementing
that
condition?
you
see
you
have
a
license
to
build
a
dam
which
you
have
applied
for
one
now
presumably,
and
you
say
when
the
eeoc
provision,
proceeding
is
terminated
which
i
take
it
could
be
some
months
or
years
down
the
road.
you
then
will
have
a
conditional
license
to
build
the
dam
if
you
comply
with
the
order
of
the
eeoc.
now,
that
is
a
pretty
tough
road
a
whole
for
dam
(ph)
applicant,
is
it
not?
