unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
the
court
appeals
is
saying
that
in
an
individual
proceeding,
you
could
look
into
employment
practices
as
such
or
only
in
connection
with
the
cost?m
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
thought
that,
you
concluded
that
if
they
had
the
legal
employment
practices
their
cost
might
be
lower.
it
might
make
some
difference.
unknown
speaker
but,
yes,
but
only
because
of
its
impact
on
cost.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
but
let
me
get
your
position
clear.
suppose
that
the
fpc
on
its
own,
now
in
a
rate
proceeding
was
asked
to
give
rate
relief
to
a
company
and
it
thought
that
the
company
was
engaged
in
illegal
employment
practices,
which
if
cured
would
lower
their
costs.
would
you
have
the
power
under
your
present
statute
to
tell
the
company
that
you
would
not
give
them
rate
relief
because
they
have
–
because
the
legal
cost
would
not
justify
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
asking
you
that.
i
asked
you
do
you
have
the
power
to
determine
it
in
your
own
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
what
if
somebody
comes
in
to
one
of
your
rate
proceedings
and
one
of
the
customers
of
the
utility
and
complains
that
the
utility
–
that
some
of
the
cost
claimed
by
the
utility
are
forbidden
by
law?
unknown
speaker
would
you
inquire
into
that?
unknown
speaker
but
only
because
there
is
another
mechanism
for
determining,
whether
there
are
legal
costs?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
journey,
can
i
ask
you
a
follow-up
question?
unknown
speaker
supposing
it
was
proposed
that
there
be
a
rule
defining
when
the
attorney’s
fees
and
like
cost
would
be
allowed
in
litigation
involving
charges
of
discrimination
against
the
power
company.
would
you
have
jurisdiction
to
adopt
the
rule
that
would
say
in
certain
circumstances
those
costs
would
be
allowable
and
then
others
they
would
not?
unknown
speaker
then
you
do
not
–
that
judge
mcgowan
(ph)
in
his
opinion
said
they
did
not
know
whether
your
holding
of
no
jurisdiction
was
that
no
jurisdiction
to
adopt
the
specific
proposed
rule
that
the
petitioners
had
submitted
or
any
rule
relating
to
employment
discrimination.
the
one
you
have
said
you
could
adopt
would
be
a
rule
relating
to
employment
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
but
mcgowan
(ph)
did
not
require
you
to
make
any
rules.
he
permitted
you
as
i
understand
it
or
the
court
of
appeals
would
permit
you
to
go
at
it
on
just
a
case-to-case
basis—
unknown
speaker
and
only
in
connection
with
cost.
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
considered
in
a
rate
proceeding
whether
a
company
has
unneeded
employees?
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
do
look
in
the
charges
of
featherbedding?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
look
in
the
labor
questions.
unknown
speaker
mr.
journey,
may
i
just
interrupt
you
and
how
is
that
different
from
disallowing
the
cost
to
–
a
bribe
to
a
public
official
for
example,
does
that
cost
associate
with
a
violation
of
law,
why
is
discrimination
any
different
than
any
other
kind
of
violation?
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
would
act
on
substantial
evidence
as
i
understood
it
without
a—
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
you
had
substantial
evidence
of
unnecessary
costs
incurred
in
connection
with
racial
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
how
was
that
different?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
one
of
power
would
it
be
essential
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
that
you
would
defer
until
after
there
had
been
an
adjudication.
unknown
speaker
you
concede
as
i
understand
you
that
you
do
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
significance
of
costly
illegal
conduct
in
the
bribe
area,
do
you
make
the
same
concession
with
respect
to
costly
illegal
conduct
in
the
discrimination
area
and
if
not
why
not?
unknown
speaker
if
you
could
review
it,
could
you
also
make
a
rule
in
advance
indicating
the
circumstances
under
which
you
would
disallow
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
journey,
assume
you
had
a
situation
in
which
a
utility
had
been
found
guilty
of
discriminatory
practices
in
order
to
pay
back
pay,
you
know,
fixed
amount,
would
you
as
of
today
on
the
practices
presently
prevailing
disallow
the
back
pay
ordered
by
say,
a
court?
unknown
speaker
in
that
situation,
you
would
have
a
quantified
cost.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
in
many
situations
involving
alleged
discrimination
there
would
be
no
quantification.
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
to
pursue
that
topic
of
--
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
--
do
you
think
you
would
be
acting
contrary
that
court
of
appeals
opinion
if
in
a
specific
case
you
came
to
these
very
conclusions
that
you
have
just
now
stated
that
you
have
looked
at
this
and
you
really
cannot
arrive
at
anything
substantial
or
definite.
and
that
it
is
wholly
speculative
and
you
just
put
the
issue
aside.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
want
to
think
about
it
right
now,
but
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
suppose,
you
did
not—
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
would
be
required
to
inquire
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
you
whether
or
not
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
would
permit
you
to
conclude
just
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
that
you
just
–
now
you
have
looked
into
it
but
it
does
not
a
quantifiable
manner.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
now?
is
that
what
it
permits
you
to
do
that
or
would
it
require
you
nevertheless
to
regulate
the
employment
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
somebody
might
bring
you
up
here
but
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
your
opinion
was
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
is
what
you
say,
but
that
is
not
my
question.
my
question
is
if
you
exercised
that
authority
and
found
that
you
just
could
do
not
quantify
and
so
there
was
no
relief
given.
would
that
be
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
that
is
mr.
justice
white
is
asking
you,
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
is
not
the
problem
that
you
confront
not
the
one
you
have
been
articulating
but
the
fact
that
in
every
rate
case,
on
a
every
request
for
the
licensing
of
an
applicant,
this
issue
would
be
raised
and
you
have
to
try
it
and
it
might
take
you
6
week
or
6
months
to
litigate
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
journey,
you
were
asked
a
question
about
the
possible
example
of
quantified
cost
in
a
back
pay
award
and
you
expressed
the
opinion,
those
might
well
be
disallowed
by
the
commission.
has
there
ever
been
an
issue
such
as
that
actually
presented
to
the
commission,
or
are
you
just
giving
an
opinion
based
on
your
judgment
as
what
they
do.
unknown
speaker
a
utility
which
might
have
been
found
guilty
of
employment
discrimination
having
assessed
against
it
a
back
pay
award.
you
suggested
that
such
an
amount
might
well
be
disallowed
as
a
proper
cost.
is
that
issue
actually
been
passed
on
by
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
was
unfair
labor
practices.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)i
take
it
then,
the
procedure
that
would
be
followed
in
connection
with
an
eeoc
back
pay,
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
some
of
these
back
pay
awards
handle
a
lot
of
money,
a
million
more
dollars,
many
millions,
some
of
them,
are
they
handled
just
administratively
this
way?
unknown
speaker
but
i
do
not
think
you
have
answered
at
least
what
i
understood
that
chief
justice
question
to
be
and
that
is,
if
the
federal
power
commission
does
what
you
asked
it
to
investigate
discrimination
and
employment
on
the
practice
of
the
utility
and
concludes
there
was
no
discriminatory
practice
here.
may
you
then
or
may
people
who
claim
they
were
discriminated
again
to
a
parties
to
the
fpc
proceedings,
go
the
eeoc
and
start
all
over
again?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
the
fpc
would
have
the
power
to
enjoin
certain
employment
practice
or
order
reinstatement
or
back
pay
or
things
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
--
do
you
think
that
you
are
barred
from
raising
those
issues
in
licensing
proceedings
now?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
would
the
same
argument
apply
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
a
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
fcc?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
sec?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
a
back
pay
award
but
you
would
want
the
–
i
thought
you
are
at
–
going
to
be
asking
the
commission
to
disallow
certain
costs
that
were
invalid
because
of
discrimination.
that
is
what
could
be
asked
them
to
do.
unknown
speaker
would
it
disallow?
unknown
speaker
what
interest
do
you
have
in
whether
–
after
the
back
pay
award
has
been
made,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
your
clients
whether
that
is
considered
in
the
utilities
rates
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
lost
on
that
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
take
it
in
the
sense
that
fpc
was
not
ordered
to
adopt
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
it
might
be,
they
were
not
required.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
again
--
tell
me
a
cost
in
a
rulemaking
proceeding,
this
is
justice
brennan’s
question.
tell
me
a
cost
in
a
rulemaking.
proceeding
that
you
would
ask
to
be
disallowed
because
of—
unknown
speaker
in
addition
to
back
pay,
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
make
a
guess
as
to
how
much
this
discriminatory
conduct
is
costing
the
company
in
the
long
run
and
disallow
that
one.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
if
was
taken
by
the
rate
base,
you
would
simply
lower
the
percentage
of
return
or
you
would
ask
them
to?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
whatever
you
call
them,
penalties
or
whatever
they
are
disallowed
as
the
cost
--
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
hypothetical,
let
us
assume
that
a
utility
with
a
rate
case
pending
before
the
commission
was
charged
with
having
pursued
a
policy
persistently
say
over
10
to
15
years,
a
discrimination
in
promotion,
with
all
let
us
say
200
or
300
individuals.
what
sort
of
relief
would
you
asked
of
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
litigate
before
the
commission,
first
of
all
the
issue
of
alleged
discrimination
in
promotions.
would
you
take
them
out
one
by
one,
how
else
would
you
deal
with
them?
unknown
speaker
no
authority
to
order
directly
any
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
utility,
would
it?
it
could
as
you
say
perhaps
say,
we
will
grant
you
the
requested
rate
increase
provided
you
satisfy
us
within
a
specified
period
of
time
that
these
practices
have
been
eliminated.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
the
charge
was
that
in
the
employment
of
people
over
a
long
period
of
time,
discriminatory
practices
had
been
pursued
and
there
were
a
substantial
number
of
people
who
claimed
that
they
were
entitled
to
employment
and
to
be
put
in
to
their
rightful
place
in
the
union
structure.
what
would
you
request
the
commission
to
do
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
the
counsel
for
the
utility
company,
you
would
have
to
be
told,
you
would
want
to
be
told
which
of
the
150
people
who
said
they
have
discriminated
against
would
have
to
be
employed,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
the
fcf,
who
would
do
it?
unknown
speaker
if
the
fpc
conditioned
a
rate
increases
on
the
utility
doing
this,
would
it
not
the
commission
have
to
identify
that
people
who
said
they
have
been
discriminated
against
so
that
the
utility
would
know
how
to
comply
with
that
condition.
unknown
speaker
it
might
take
two
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
utility
do
for
a
public
financing
--
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
were
dual
proceedings
pending
involving
precisely
the
same
charges
before
the
eeoc
and
the
federal
power
commission,
what
would
be
the
situation
then?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
eeoc
has
ordered
them
to
do
something,
the
dam
applicant
to
do
something
and
he
is
not
doing
it,
the
eeoc
can
seek
court
relief,
you
would
not
have
the
federal
power
commission,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
the
ultimate
remedy
would
be
revoking
a
license
perhaps
after
the
dam
had
been
built?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
judge
mcgowan
(ph)
writing
for
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
your
task
and
i
am
reading,
in
protecting
the
consumer
against
exploitation
can
be
alternatively
described
as
a
task
of
saying
that
no
necessary
or
illegitimate
cost
are
passed
along
with
the
consumer,
to
the
costumer,
that
is
the
way
he
described
your
job.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
went
and
said
without
attempting
the
exhaustive
enumeration
we
identified
at
least
the
following
as
indicative
of
those
arguably
within
the
commissions’
range
of
concern.
now
i
take
it
that
some
of
these
you
already
indicate
that
commission
regularly
considers
at
least
in
other
kinds
of
cases.
one,
duplicative
labor
cost
incurred
in
the
form
of
back
pay
recoveries
by
employees,
who
have
proven
that
they
were
discriminatorily
denied
employment
or
advancement.
unknown
speaker
so
this
issue
–
this
is
just
not
an
issue,
do
you
not
think—?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
back
pay
with
respect
to
this
–
a
discriminatory
practice
that
has
been
adjudicated
by
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
how
about
the
–
three,
the
cost
of
legal
proceedings
in
either
of
these
two
categories?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
contend,
you
do
not
–
you
would
not
have
jurisdiction
or
that
you
should
not
consider
those.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
several
of
these
things
he
enlists,
there
is
no
real
question
about
either
your
power
or
your
order
desirability
of
considering
them.
