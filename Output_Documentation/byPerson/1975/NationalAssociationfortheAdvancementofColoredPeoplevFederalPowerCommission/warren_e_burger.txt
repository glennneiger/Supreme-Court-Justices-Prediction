chief

we
hear
arguments
next
in
1619,
federal
power
commission
against
the
naacp
and
1608,
naacp
against
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
journey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
justice
rehnquist
was
just
raising,
with
a
variation,
suppose
the
claim
was
that
the
president
of
the
company
had
caused
the
employment
of
a
law
firm
and
a
retainer
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
a
year.
the
law
firm
being
headed
up
by
the
son
of
the
president
of
the
company
and
that
these
payments
refer
unnecessary
services.
you
would
inquire
into
that
kind
of
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
though
the
president
had
a
yacht
or
an
airplane
that
he
did
not
need
that
was
charging
it
off
to
the
utility,
you
are
inquiring
to
that
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
glickstein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
in
your
view
should
prevail
in
the
federal
power
commission
undertakes
these
evaluations
and
the
eeoc
and
the
complaining
parties
all
disagree
with
it.
in
other
words,
suppose
they
had
a
rather
fixed
pattern
of
rejecting
all
such
plans,
have
you
exhausted
your
remedies
when
you
have
gone
to
the
federal
power
commission
or
do
you
get
another
bite
at
the
apple
over
in
the
eeoc?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
what
you
want
them
pass
on,
namely
to
get
in
the
substantive
of
aspect
forbidden
employment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
make
my
question
clear,
they
do
just
what
you
ask
them
to
do.
they
go
into
the
subject
of
employment
practices
with
respect
to
minorities.
but
you
do
not
like
their
decision
assuming
that
you
were
bringing
such
a
case,
do
you
think
the
federal
power
commission
has
not
followed
eeoc
guidelines
and
a
number
of
other
things.
what
do
you
do
about
that,
just
routinely
take
it
as
you
would
any
other,
federal
power
determination
in
the
court
of
appeal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
you
would
in
any
other
–
in
a
rate
case
or
any
other
issue,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
or
have
you
raised
it
with
the
icc
for
example
in
the
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
you
have
persuaded
them
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
suggested
question,
which
may
have
an
element
of
heresy
in
it,
mr.
glickstein
suppose
you
have
a
utility
down
the
southwestern
part
of
the
country,
and
eeoc
makes
some
preliminary
determination
that
they
have
none
but
they
have
no
people
employed
in
the
company
or
practically
none
with
spanish
surnames.
and
so
as
a
result
of
the
negotiation
not
litigation,
negotiation
with
eeoc,
the
company
agrees
to
appoint
three
out
of
every
four
employees
thereafter
with
a
spanish
surname.
and
then
some
years
go
by
and
some
objection
is
made
to
the
rates
and
the
proof
is
in
the
hypothetical
and
you
must
accept
this
as
being
the
proof
that
the
cost
of
this
affirmative
action
program
has
been
enormous.
that
it
is
taking
three
spanish
speaking
surnamed
people,
and
do
the
work
that
two
people
did
before,
partly
because
their
lack
of
command
of
english
and
perhaps
their
lack
of
education
or
whatnot.
any
reason
you
want
to
ascribe
but
the
conclusion
is
that
it
is
a
wasteful,
expensive
program.
now
then,
what
about
disallowing
that
cost?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
my
question
is
directed
as
to
who
decides
this?
you
are
going
to
say
that
the
federal
power
commission
would
have
to
respond
to
this
kind
of
a
challenge
to
wasteful
expenditure.
because
on
my
hypothesis,
there
is
a
determination
that
this
affirmative
action
program
is
costly
and
will
become
more
costly
over
a
period
of
years.
so
you
say
the
federal
power
commission
then
must
say
well,
it
is
true
that
this
is
wasteful
and
unnecessary
in
terms
of
operating
the
company.
but
because
it
furthers
a
desirable
social
policy,
then
the
rate
makers
must
–
the
rate
payers
must
bear
that
burden.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
did
not
have
any
evidentiary
basis
for
that
projection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
should
be
your
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
now
leaving
these
very
pleasant
figures
about
the
gross
national
product
or
that
the
federal
power
commission
which
has
a
very
narrow
limited
mission,
presumably,
if
we
read
the
act
is
equipped
to
deal
with
these
broad
national
highly
desirable
social
objectives.
that
is
really
one
of
the
underlying
questions
in
this
case,
is
it
not,
if
not
the
underlying
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
they
not
been
--
back
pay
awards
are
sometime
has
been
held
to
be
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
journey,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and

74-1608
and
related

of
