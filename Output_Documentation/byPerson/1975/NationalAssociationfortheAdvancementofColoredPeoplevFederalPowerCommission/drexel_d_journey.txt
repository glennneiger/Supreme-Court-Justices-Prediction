mr.
drexel
d.
journey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
comes
before
you
with
a
history
of
6
years
in
which
the
eeoc,
the
fpc,
the
justice
department,
the
civil
service
commission
and
others
have
been
seeking
an
answer
to
a
question.
that
question
is
the
proper
interrelation
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
laws
and
economic
regulatory
laws.
we
have
tried
three
approaches
to
get
a
definitive
answer.
we
have
tried
administrative
procedures.
we
have
tried
the
legislative
route
and
we
have
tried
the
judicial
route,
in
all
of
them
we
have
failed.
what
we
now
require
is
for
this
court
to
set
defenses
by
which
economic
regulatory
agencies,
equal
employment
opportunity
agencies
like
the
eeoc,
the
regulated
gas
and
the
electric
utility
industry
and
others
may
function.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
you
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
this,
the
pg&e
case
which
is
quoted
in
the
commission’s
declaratory
order
number
623.
you
will
see
that
this
controversy
started
out
in
a
fpc
hydro
licensing
case
raised
initially
by
the
california
rural
legal
assistance
inc.
the
matter
in
that
case
was
whether
economic
–
the
issue
–
the
precise
issue
there
and
here
is
whether
economic
regulatory
statutes
are
an
alternative
enforcement
strategy
for
the
equal
employment
opportunity
laws.
the
pg&e
case,
44
fpc,
that
is
quoted
in
the
declaratory
order
623
did
not
go
to
court.
the
commission
when
it
faced
the
issue
in
the
pg&e
case
invited
the
naacp
in.
they
invited
others
in
to
hear
the
points
of
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
and
whether
economic
regulatory
laws
could
be
used
as
an
enforcement
strategy.
the
commission
concluded
in
the
pg&e
case
that
it
could
not.
the
naacp
then
brought
a
general
proceeding
which
culminated
in
opinion
623
which
was
directed
basically
to
the
gas
and
electric
utility
industry
throughout
the
united
states.
we
think
that
the
question
is
important
and
should
be
resolved
by
this
court.
we
think
it
is
right
for
judicial
review.
naacp
argues
that
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
that
the
power
commission
have
affirmative
action
employment
regulatory
programs.
they
argue
also
that
under
the
public
interest
concept,
there
is
enfolded
within
the
umbrella
of
the
public
interest
notion,
a
requirement
in
the
power
commission
to
resolve
these
questions.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
no,
said,
when
you
look
at
the
function
of
a
regulatory
agency
such
as
the
fpc
you
must
look
at
its
delegated
authority.
it
found
that
we
had
under
the
power
and
gas
act,
three
things
to
do
basically,
we
were
to
look
at
the
conservation
of
natural
resources,
we
were
to
look
adequacy
of
supply
of
electric
energy
and
natural
gas
and
that
we
were
to
protect
the
consumer
from
exploitation.
the
court
went
on
after
making
that
finding
and
holding
that
we
had
no
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
employment
practices
should
be
to
reach
into
the
operation
of
the
economic
regulatory
function
and
it
found
in
our
ability
to
disallow
costs.
what
i
call
an
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
the
commission,
which
seems
to
say
by
reason
of
the
things
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
us
do,
namely
get
the
eeoc
forms
and
let
people
intervene
who
claim
they
were
victims
of
discrimination
and
unequal
employment
hearings
and
opportunity
to
be
heard.
well,
we
think
what
this
comes
down
is
an
endless
procession
of
litigation
for
us
in
terms
of,
why
would
we
hear
these
questions,
if
we
are
not
being
told
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
can
do
indirectly
that
thing
which
they
said
we
could
not
do
directly.
they
said
we
could
not
regulate
employment
practices
per
se.
now
when
we
discussed
this
matter
with
the
solicitor
general,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
he
thought
the
case
had
been
properly
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
we
do
not
have
a
regulatory
jurisdiction
per
se.
we
think
that
in
looking
at
the
additional
findings
of
the
court,
they
posed
a
most
difficult
situation
for
the
commission
to
administer—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
the
ladder
--
but
we—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
suggests
that
we
can,
one,
either
deny
rate
relief
or
deny
a
certificate
because
of
what
might
be
our
independent
views
of
what
should
be
their
employment
practices.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
cost
impact
and
service
impact
but
the
way
the
equal
employment
opportunity
laws
are
structured
and
the
way
the
regulatory
laws
are
structured.
there
is
now
in
being
under
the
employment
act
of
1972,
a
comprehensive
control
mechanism
administered
by
the
eeoc.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
if
the
legality
question
had
been
determined
in
the
forum
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
believe
not
in
the
first
instance.
we
apply
the
doctrines
of
prudence,
of
just
and
reasonableness
and
we
disallow
costs
for
rate
purposes
which
do
not
meet
the
standards
of
the
gas
and
the
power
act.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
if
they
are
forbidden
by
law
there
is—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes,
sir,
but
we
think
your
honor
that
is
not
what
this
case
is
about
and
in
historical
context
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
think
that
that
is
the
orderly
way
to
relate
the
equal
employment
opportunity
control
machinery
versus
the
economic
regulatory
machinery.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
for
cost
purposes
account
426.5
would
disallow
that
for
fpc
rate
purposes
upon
a
showing
of
substantial
evidence
and
relating
it
to
the
questions
of
rate
making
under
the
power
and
the
gas
acts.
but
i
am
suggesting
also
to
you
that
when
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
the
arguments
that
were
made
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
arguments
that
are
made
to
you
that
is
not
the
question
that
is
being
put
to
you.
you
are
being
asked
to
–
because
of
the
administrative
workload
of
the
eeoc,
the
100,000
plus
cases
in
the
backlog
to
have
us
through
the
economic
rate
making
procedure
determine
what
the
employment
conditions
should
be
of
the
utilities
whose
services
we
regulate.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes
sir,
there
has
been
a
litigation
on
that
question
on
legal
fees
and
we
have
determined
that
the
commission
makes
a
determination
on
a
cost
basis
supplying
the
just
and
reasonable
standards
whether
it
should
be
allowed
for
rate
purposes
or
disallowed.
but
it
is
up
to
the
utility
management
in
the
first
instance
to
engage
the
lawyer
and
the
lawyer
then
determines
with
management
what
they
do
or
do
not
do.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
have
had
that
question
your
honor
and
we
have
disallowed
some
of
the
costs
and
that
has
gone
up
through
the
fourth
circuit.
but
that
question
has
been
litigated.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
that
just
and
reasonable
standard
and
the
prudency
test.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
prudency
test
for—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
and
disallow
that.
yes.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes,
sir,
that
has
all
been
litigated
in
the
early
history
of
the
power
commission
after
the
passage
of
the
holding
company
act.
you
will
find
the
cases
that
related
to
the
cost
disallowance
and
rate
disallowance
coming
up
in
the
early
supreme
court
history.
what,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
not
what
is
being
asked
here
and
that
was
not
what
was
involved.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
think
for
purposes
of
fixing
the
regulated
utilities
cost,
we
would.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
no.
i
think
your
honor
that,
as
i
understood
the
question
you
put
to
me
was
whether
we
could
disallow
the
costs
of
the
utility
whose
rates
we
were
fixing.
when
judge
mcgawan
(ph)
opinion,
what
he
is
really
suggesting
that
we
do
is
permit
people
to
intervene
and
we
believe
by
indirection
fix
the
employment
practices
of
utilities.
we
regulate
the
services
and
the
cost
of
utilities
in
the
interstate
commerce.
what
this
is
all
about
is
the
commission
is
being
asked
to
grapple
with
the
economic
conditions
of
admittedly
disadvantaged
portions
of
the
society.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
but
if
there
is
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
but
if
there
is
jurisdiction
your
honor
whether
it
is
rule
making
or
ad
hoc,
it
really
means
that
--
that
opinions
means
one
of
two
things.
we
can
do
by
indirection
that
which
he
said
we
cannot
do
directly
or
it
means
that
we
have
an
ancillary
investigatory
review
authority
to
consider
facts.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
have
looked
at
–
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes
sir.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes,
they
relate
to
costs.
but
here
what
we
are
talking
about
is
using
the
economic
regulatory
process
not
to
in
effect
control
service
or
rates
or
costs
but
to
reach
back
in
and
cure
things
which
are
socially
and
legally
undesirable.
the
employment
practices
of
utilities
which
may
be
on
a
discriminatory
basis.
now,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
when
the
official
is
bribed
presumably
there
is
a
determination
that
he
has
been
bribed
and
there
is
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
would
act
on
substantial
evidence—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
if
there
were—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
if
there
was
a
question
of
--
if
i
may
answer
on
the
context
of
your
bribery
question.
if
there
was
a
proceeding
to
determine
the
bribe
question,
i
would
recommend
to
the
power
commission
that
it
defer
processing
of
that
until
the
bribed
trial
question
had
been
resolved
because
under
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
it
is
not
essential
to
defer
for
a
cost
allowance
purposes
your
honor.
but
what
it
does
require
is
if
the
other
proceeding
is
going
forward
and
if
it
is
determined
that
there
was
not
a
bribe
and
indeed
those
costs
should
be
disallowed
and
we
had
kicked
them
out
under
account
426.5
then
we
would
be
in
the
process
of
needing
to
put
them
back
in
again.
we
do
not
operate
in
a
vacuum
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
if
it
is
for
cost
incidence
purposes,
we
could
review
it
and
we
could
disallow
it.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
not
if
it
went
to
the
question
of
saying
that
we
could
prescribe
what
would
be
the
labor
requirements
of
the
regulated
utility.
see,
the
rule
that
was
proposed
to
us
is
that
we
undertake
and
determine
an
affirmative
action
program
like
the
philadelphia
plan
or
one
of
the
other
plans
to
determine
the
overall
employment
conduct
and
practices
of
the
electric
and
gas
utility
industry.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
do
not
as
a
matter
of
course
get
to
that
question
we
–
for
this
reason.
the
commission
regulates
10%
of
the
revenues
of
the
electric
utility
industry.
we
regulate
about
90%
of
the
revenues
of
the
interstate
gas
and
electric
utility
industry.
but
a
good
part
of
the
employment
of
the
gas
and
the
electric
utility
industry
is
covered
by
state
fair
employment
practice
laws.
it
is
covered
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
laws,
it
is
covered
by
the
federal
office
of
contract
compliance
and
the
general
services
administration
is
the
one
that
fixes
the
standards
and
criteria
by
which
utilities
must
comport
themselves.
we
take
account
of
their
requirements
just
as
we
take
account
of
the
irs
requirements
or
any
other
requirement.
we
might
want
to
disallow
an
income
tax
thing
or
something
of
that
nature
but
we
would
not
in
the
first
instance
make
the
determination
of
whether
someone
had
violated
the
income
tax
laws.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes,
sir
that
would
be
question
of
putting
it
in
to
the
cost
of
service
and
having
determined
that
it
was
not
a
just
and
reasonable
item
if
in
fact
it
was
not
just
and
reasonable
then
disallow
it.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
right.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
that
is
right.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
well,
there
are
areas
of
penalties
of
back
pay
and
other
things
where
items
can
be
liquidated
and
we
can
handle
them
through
the
economic
regulatory
process.
we
find
it
most
difficult
however
to
speculate
as
what
might
be
the
loss
of
morale.
what
might
be
the
inefficiency,
what
might
be
a
lot
of
the
other
factors
associated
with
this?
we
submit
that
under
their
end
result
test
of
natural
gas
pipeline
in
the
case
law
progeny
wherefrom1940
on
you
have
reviewed
our
cases
on
a
functional
appraisal
basis.
you
should
not
find
that
we
have
this
jurisdiction.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
think
what
would
happen
there
is
we
would
then
get
into
a
question
of
interpreting
the
opinion
if
i
advise
the
commission
we
could
not—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
think
that
probably
that
court
of
appeals
opinion
means
that
we
could
go
in
and
regulate
the
employment
practices
of
the
utilities.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
then
it
would
be
–
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
then
it
would
be
a
question
to
whether
we
abused
our
power.
see,
if
you
have
the
power
then—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
--
i
certainly
would
take
that
position
that
the
commission
should
not
be
forced
to
do
this
but—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
would
have
us
back
up
here
again
after
i
have
so
advised
the
commission
because
the
people
would
not
be
satisfied
that
the
proof
of
the
putting
in
this
was
until
we—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
means
that
there
is
an
ancillary
authority
in
the
commission
to
determine
employment
practices.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
if
we
could
defend
successfully
against
the
challenge
that
we
abused
our
discretion
and
not
acting,
i
would—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
think
that
we
would
have
difficulty
in
maintaining
that
position.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
that
is
the
burden,
the
administrative
burden
question.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
well,
we
have
that
in
our
brief
your
honor.
and
we
think
that
this
would
be
an
unmanageable
workload
for
us.
we
think
that
under
the
end
result
test
of
natural
there
are
three
reasons
why
you
should
not
find
this.
one,
we
are
not
equipped
to
do
it.
two,
we
are
otherwise
busily
occupied
with
gas
and
electric
matters.
three,
there
already
is
in
place
in
functioning
a
mechanism
under
the
equal
employment
opportunity
laws
by
which
equal
employment
practices
are
regulated.
the
1972
amendments
did
not
give
us
that
authority.
the
basic
64
act
did
not,
our
act
does
not
give
it
to
us.
you
are
being
asked
to
read
it
into
our
statute
and
you
are
being
asked
to
have
us
ask
answer
in
each
case,
substantial
questions
of
relevance
and
materiality.
we
think
we
would
be
in
a
hopeless
morass.
we
would
like
the
fences
fixed.
either
the
economic
regulatory
process
is
an
alternate
enforcement
strategy
for
the
equal
employment
laws
or
it
is
not.
we
think
it
is
not.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
in
terms
of
disallowing—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
it
has
not
been
passed
on
in
the
employment
context
but
it
has
been
passed
on
in
the
context
of
other
things
as
litigation
ensued
out
of
the
holding
company
in
the
divestiture
proceedings
and
as
the
gas
and
electric
industry
was
unscrambled
in
terms
of
its
financial
control.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
it
is
–
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
it
is
not
come
up
in
terms
of
a
decision
that
the
commission
rendered.
how
this
actually
happens
is
when
the
auditors
go
in
and
check
the
books.
they
in
effect
kick
out
as
a
matter
of
course
duplicate
labor
cost.
you
see
the
gas
and
the
electric
utility
industry,
the
labor
costs
are
all
handled
by
in-place
and
functioning
accounting
requirements
and
it
is
broken
down
by
the
functions
of
production
transmission,
distribution
in
general.
so
that
when
the
auditors
go
in
and
look
at
the
books
of
the
gas
and
the
electric
companies
they
kick
out
these
duplicate
costs.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
same
thing,
and
if
there
was
a
penalty
question
it
would
be
kicked
out
under
account
426.3,
if
it
was
an
unreasonable
charge
it
would
be
kicked
out
under
426.5
--
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
they
would
be
kicked
out
by
the
auditors,
yes,
in
the
accounts
if
they
were
duplicate
costs
or
penalties.
so
they
are
not
left
without
a
remedy,
they
have
one.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
would
just
say
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
that
the
commissions’
briefs,
i
believe
have
covered
the
constitution
points.
i
think
they
have
covered
the
legislative
history
points.
i
think
that
they
have
covered
the
reference
to
the
1972
equal
employment
laws
and
the
fact
that
the
procedure
there
for
the
eeoc
seeking
cease
and
desist
orders
in
court
review
were
all
setup
and
created
in
1972
to
correct
what
the
eeoc
said
it
needed
enforcement
authority
to
implement
what
you
have
said
in
the
johnson
case
is
a
comprehensive
regulatory
mechanism
for
dealing
with
the
equal
employment
questions.
we
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
the
power
of
the
gas
act
that
speaks
to
the
question
that
mr.
glickstein
and
naacp
want
us
to
undertake.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes,
sir.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
i
spoke
about
that
question
earlier
and
said
that
for
whatever
reason
if
back
pay
and
duplicate
labor
was
involved
the
auditors
would
pick
that
up.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
not
for
ratemaking
purposes
in
terms
of
cost
that
is
lost.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
it
has
been
resolved,
just
as
mr.
chief
justice
said
somebody’s
relative
on
the
payroll.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
the
cost
of
legal
proceedings
has
been
the
subject
of
litigation
and
the—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
we
do
not
for
cost
purposes,
no.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
if
you
are
looking
at
the
rate
regulatory
process
is
the
mechanism
by
which
you
adjust
the
economic
relation
between
the
producer
of
gas
and
energy
and
the
consumer.
we
go
through
and
on
a
cost
to
service
prudent
investment
basis
with
a
just
and
reasonable
standard,
we
go
ahead
and
disallow
these
things.
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
i
think
the
issue
here,
you
are
being
asked
to
have
the
regulatory
process
as
a
concept
be
an
alternate
enforcement
strategy
for
equal
employment
laws.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
yes,
sir.
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
that
is
what
i
am—
mr.
drexel
d.
journey
that
is
what
i
understood
to
be
the
argument.
thank
you,
sir.
