justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
hear
what
you
say,
but
does
it
mean
that
you
have
a
full-dress
trial
before
a
jury
on
the
merits
on
the
venue
issue
alone?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
does
not
exercise
that
discretion,
then
the
plaintiff
has
a
burden
of
showing
about
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
is
entitle
to
recover
on
the
merits?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
might
have
a
weekâ€™s
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
you
are
a
foreign
corporation,
you
do
not
have
that
opt-in.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
defendant
put
in
evidence
at
the
jury
trial
to
controvert
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
plaintiff?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
have
a
full-dress
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
you
carry
on,
what
is
the
justification
for
what
in
effect
is
a
mini
trial
on
a
plea
of
privilege
where
the
only
issue
is
venue
--
what
is
the
rationale?
what
prompted
the
texas
courts
to
construe
section
23
in
this
fashion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
(inaudible)
summary
judgment
practice
in
texas?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
this
curious
procedure?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
defend
the
classification
here.
would
you
summarize
to
me
exactly
what
you
think
because
state
interest
is
that
justifies
this
different
treatment
for
a
foreign
corporation
and
a
domestic
corporation
once
venue
is
sought
in
the
particular
locale
involved
in
this
case.
what
is
the
state
interest
that
your
(voice
overlap)
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
us
assume
a
domestic
corporation
and
a
foreign
corporation
both
being
sued
in
precisely
the
same
county.
as
i
understand
it
one
has
the
privilege
of
the
mini
trials
and
the
other
does
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
no
--
is
there
no
situation,
no
county,
no
cause
of
action
in
which
a
domestic
corporation
does
not
have
the
mini
trial
when
the
foreign
corporation
was
to
have
it.
i
put
that
badly,
(voice
overlap)
do
you
want
me
to
put
it
again?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
do
treat
a
foreign
corporation
differently
under
the
circumstances
before
us
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
answer
that
question
please
sir.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
both
to
have
the
mini
trial
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
not
told
me
what
interest
that
says,
what
does
that
do
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
of
texas?
