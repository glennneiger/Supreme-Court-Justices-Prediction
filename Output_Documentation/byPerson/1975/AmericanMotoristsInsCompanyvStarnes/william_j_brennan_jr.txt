now
the
first
of
these
cases
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
civil
appeal
in
texas.
under
the
texas
law
when
a
domestic
corporation
challenges
the
venue
of
a
seat
brought
against
it,
the
plaintiff
amongst
other
things
has
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
he
has
a
cause
of
action
against
the
domestic
corporation.
where
a
foreign
corporation
is
sued
and
challenges
the
venue
of
action
against
it,
a
similar
requirement
is
not
made
by
texas
law.
and
this
difference
between
the
situations
of
the
domestic
and
foreign
corporations
was
challenged
as
a
denial
of
equal
protection
and
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas
rejected
as
without
merit
that
equal
protection
claim,
we
affirm.
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joins.
