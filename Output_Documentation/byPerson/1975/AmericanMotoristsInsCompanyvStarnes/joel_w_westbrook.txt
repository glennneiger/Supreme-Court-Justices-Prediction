mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
i
am
joel
westbrook
of
san
antonio,
texas,
representing
the
appellant,
american
motorist.
we
are
aware,
may
i
please
the
court
that
not
very
many
constitutional
venue
of
questions
come
to
this
court.
but
i
must
say
i
must
pass
on
you
that
it
has
been
said
that
texas
probably
has
a
furnished
own
appellate
system,
more
venue
appealed
and
all
the
other
49
jurisdictions
combined.
and
i
believe
this
case
will
help
you
see
why
that
is.
because
in
texas
the
venue
cared
a
great
deal
more
encumbrance
than
just
where
the
case
is
going
to
be
tried.
our
client,
the
american
motorists,
unsuccessfully
challenged
venue
in
this
--
on
issue
of
motorists
case.
that
brought
against
it
in
a
texas
state
district
court
in
mclennan
county,
texas.
the
appellate
then
had
no
more
success
in
the
appellate
court
of
texas
because
the
texas
supreme
court
had
previously,
in
1963
in
its
commercial
insurance
versus
adam’s
case
against
virtually
the
same
constitutional
challenge
and
held
against
the
challenge,
and
virtually
the
same
one
that
we
are
making
today.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir,
texas.
actually,
your
honor,
the
texas
procedure
of
refusing
writ
of
error
and
choosing
between
two
conflicting
courts
of
civil
appeals’
judgments
on
this
point
and
in
per
curiam,
selecting
one
of
them
and
when
writ
is
per
curiam
to
texas
out
right,
well,
that
is
the
same
precedential
value
as
a
texas
supreme
court
case
would
have.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
you
honor,
i
felt
that
the
court
would
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
actually,
we
have
not
approved
a
case
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir.
it
is
a
final
judgment.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
have
the
familiarity
with
langdeau
on
that
point,
your
honor,
but
in
our
jurisdictional
statement,
the
appendix
b3,
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
which,
there
are
texas
cases
of
course,
that
do
hold
that
they
are
final
judgments
and
they
are
appealable
in
texas
and
this
court
did
note
proper
jurisdiction
before
in
an
another
texas
case,
exxon
versus
preston
and
it
had
been
briefed
by
the
appellant.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
well,
sir
i
can
only
say
that
in
preston
versus
exxon,
jurisdiction
was
noted.
it
was
never
heard
by
this
court
because
the
plaintiff
appellee
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir.
if
you
have
a
domestic
corporation
in
texas
that
challenges
venue
where
the
plaintiff
had
brought
the
action,
that
domestic
corporation,
the
defendant
files
what
is
called
a
plea
of
privilege,
a
verified
plea.
the
plaintiff
then
files
what
is
called
a
controverting
plea
and
it
is
set
down
for
hearing.
the
defend
--
a
jury
may
be
requested
by
the
defendant.
if
he
does,
however,
request
a
jury,
the
trial
court
in
his
discretion
can
try
it
on
the
merits
at
the
same
time,
but
of
course
he
is
running
the
risk
that
if
it
is
--
if
he
is
wrong
then
the
plea
of
privilege
will
be
reversed
and
he
has
to
try
it
on
the
merits
again.
now,
the
most
of
them
tried
before
the
judge.
the
judge
then
makes
a
decision
either
sustaining
or
overruling
the
plea
of
privilege.
if
it
is
sustained
then
the
case
is
transferred
in
our
case
to
dallas
county
where
the
principal
office
was
of
american
motorists,
it
is
transferred
to
that
county
unless
there
is
an
appeal
from
that
order.
if
it
is
overruled,
it
has
been
tried
in
the
county
in
which
it
was
originally
brought,
unless
it
is
an
appeal
in
that
order,
but
either
side
can
appeal
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
in
this
respect
that
when
the
domestic
corporation
make
its
challenge
to
the
venue,
the
plaintiff
in
order
to
keep
that
case
in
that
county,
mclennan
county,
has
to
prove
in
addition
to
other
factors
such
as
his
is
resident
there
or
he
is
an
agent
of
that
domestic
corporation,
resident
in
mclennan
county.
he
has
to
prove
his
cause
of
action.
every
constitute
element
of
his
cause
of
action
has
to
be
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
one
of
the
--
and
this
is
a
very
substantial
burden
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
bear
at
this
early
stage
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
that
is
right,
your
honor.
in
our
case,
we
stipulated
the
thing
we
tried
on
the
record,
we
stipulated
facts.
we
stipulated
american
motorists
was
an
illinois
corporation,
authorized
to
do
business
in
texas
and
doing
business
in
texas
and
that
it
had
an
agent
in
mclennan
county,
that
is
with
it
and
the
plaintiff
relied
upon
subdivision
27
of
our
general
venue
statute
and
that
was
sufficient
under
subdivision
27.
had
it
been
a
domestic
corporation
it
would
not
have
been
sufficient.
he
would
then
had
to
go
ahead
and
prove
his
cause
of
action,
every
element
of
it.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
if
you
ask
for
a
jury,
yes.
but
as
i
said
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
try
the
case
on
the
merits
at
the
same
time
and
try
its
plea
of
privilege,
if
he
does
ask
for
a
jury.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir,
every
element
of
the
cause
of
action,
except
damages.
yes
sir,
factual
damage.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no
sir.
just
that
you
are
a
foreign
corporation
doing
business
and
have
an
agent
in
that
county.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
it
could
be
yes,
yes
sir.
but
of
course
the
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no
sir,
i
would
say
the
normal
practices
of
the
jury
are
not
demanding.
the
normal
practice
is
that
the
judge
hears
and
makes
the
decision
and
normally
it
is
not
a
full-dress
trial.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no
sir,
it
has
to
go
beyond
that.
after
all
he
wholly
has
prove
it
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
of
course
if
the
jury
--
if
the
judge
is
the
finder
of
facts
and
he
finds
a
preponderance
there,
this
is
not
likely
to
be
upset
that
--
it
was
by
preponderance
of
evidence.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
sir,
we
say
that
the
federal
constitution
has
offended
the
equal
protection
clause,
by
reason
of
the
difference
between
subdivision
23
which
covers
domestic
corporations
and
subdivision
27
which
covers
foreign
corporations
other
than
those
specified
elsewhere
and
this
case
came
up
under
subdivision
27.
no
other
of
the
subdivisions
are
involved
in
this
situation.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact
subdivision
23
was
before
this
court
44
years
ago.
on
the
claim
that
corporations
were
discriminated
against
because
they
had
to
prove
a
cause
of
action
and
an
individual
did
not
in
order
to
avail
themselves
to
the
privilege
of
transfer
to
county
of
his
residence.
and
the
standard
we
think
is
the
standard
that
was
employed,
substantially
employed
in
the
power
manufacturing
versus
saunders,
which
this
court
decide
in
1927,
involving
an
arkansas
venue
statute.
in
that
the
case
the
arkansas
statute
permitted
a
foreign
corporation
to
be
sued
anywhere
in
the
state,
any
county
in
the
state,
whereas
a
domestic
corporations
were
limited
to
place
it
where
they
had
an
agency
or
representative
and
this
court
in
that
saunders
case
said
that
the
classification
was
not
a
reasonable
classification.
they
were
not
any
facts
related
to
the
classification
which
reasonably
could
justify,
it
is
to
us,
arbitrary.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
or
it
says
agent
or
its
principal
place
of
business
or
in
a
county
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
in
this
particular
case,
the
cause
of
action
arose
in
tarrant
county.
american
motorists
has
its
home
office
in
texas,
in
dallas
county
and
the
plaintiff
sued
in
mclennan
county,
the
county
of
his
residence.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
he
could
have
sued
a
domestic
corporation.
it
is
--
the
arkansas
statute
in
saunders,
we
recognize
that
had
a
wider
venue
play
than
here.
ours
is
deeper
because
this
matter
of
the
burden
that
domestic
--
that
a
plaintiff
against
a
domestic
corporation
has
is
a
valuable
right.
our
courts
have
consistently
said
this
is
a
valuable
right,
this
has
been
your
right
and
part
of
the
reason
is,
i
think,
readily
see
is
that
if
you
are
a
domestic
corporation,
you
get
these
things,
one
you
have
got
a
look
at
your
adversary's
tactics
and
his
witnesses,
you
get,
at
the
very
least
a
judicial
appraisal
of
the
value
of
the
case
from
the
evidentiary
point
of
view
and
you
get
an
appellate
appraisal,
perhaps
as
to
important
procedural
evidentiary
matters.
that
is
a
very
valuable
thing
that
these
domestic
corporations
have
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
rational
justification
before
having
the
--
this
difference
between
domestic
corporation's
right
to
be
transferred
to
the
county
of
their
residence
and
foreign
corporations.
now,
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir,
substantially
so.
the
domestic
corporation
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
sole
effect
and
this
is
what
was
held
i
think
in
saunders.
if
the
sole
reason
for
discriminating
in
the
venue
statutes
is
residence,
if
that
is
the
sole
reason
that
that
is
not
sufficient
to
avoid
confrontation
with
the
equal
protection
clause.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
an
argument
made
with
the
proposition
looking
for
legislative
intent,
that
is
just
like
it
may
not
have
even
intended
this
result.
it
--
what
happen
was
and
i
--
before
1943
they
were
treated
alike
then
in
1943,
the
legislature
amended
subdivision
23
and
created
this
requirement
that
a
cause
of
action
be
proven
against
it,
but
it
did
not
similarly
do
in
subdivision
27.
so,
you
are
not
getting
the
same
justice
in
the
procedure
of
defending,
of
an
insurance
company
defending,
if
you
are
foreign
corporation
that
you
would
get
if
you
are
a
domestic
corporation.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no
sir.
that
is
by
judicial
interpretations.
in
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
says
cause
of
action,
but
establishing
that
it
must
prove
a
cause
of
action
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
by
judicial
decision.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
think
partly
and
of
course
this
was
before
summary
judgment,
but
i
think
that
there
are
distinctions
still.
this
partly
was
to
nip
frivolous
cases
in
the
bud.
if
you
could
not
show
a
cause
of
action
right
there
at
the
beginning
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
or
jury
then
you
would
avoid
a
long
trial
because
we
will
transfer
to
another
county.
under
that
disability,
the
odds
are
pretty
good
it
is
not
going
to
be
tried.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
we
do
have
summary
judgment
practice,
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no
sir,
and
i
think
the
reason
why
not
and
why
we
still
have
so
much
of
this
is
it
that
you
get
some
things
in
plea
of
privilege
that
you
do
not
get
--
i
am
talking
from
the
defense
point
of
view
that
you
do
not
get
a
summary
judgment.
as
your
honor
knows,
not
texas,
but
most
states,
you
can
beat
a
summary
judgment
motion
by
the
defendant,
just
by
showing
there
is
an
issue
of
fact,
but
you
cannot
beat
a
plea
of
privilege
that
way.
you
have
to
prove
out
your
case.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir?
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
that
is
right.
it
is
conceivable
that
you
could
have
venue,
a
venue
exception
established
without
proving
a
cause
of
action,
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
know
if
that
was
a
language,
but
i
can
say
that
is
a
fair
effect
of
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
then
he
would
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
had,
i
suppose
more
difficult
problems
in
that,
but
we
would
be
happy
with
it.
if
you
did
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
this
cause.
mr.
justice
keith
wrote
an
opinion
when
this
court
sent
back
exxon
versus
preston
after
the
plaintiff
withdraw
brief
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
cause
was
moot
and
i
think
if
this
court
declares
subdivision
27
is
unconstitutional
that
it
might
well
have
the
superior
option
of
sending
it
back
for
determination
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
whether
a
cause
is
moot
or
what
further
proceedings
should
be
had.
i
think
that
is
texas’
problem
as
to
what
you
are
doing.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
your
honor,
there
is
a
question
about
whether
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
think
the
statute
limitations
on
uninsured
motors
case
is
probably
four
years,
i
am
not
sure
because
of
the
contract
aspect
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
like
we
brought
in
dallas
or
we
brought
in
tarrant
county,
if
the
forum
where
the--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
(inaudible)
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
did
not
hear
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
think
mechanistically,
i
have
to
say
yes,
but
of
course
we
are
hopeful
that
invidious
discrimination
will
be
declared
unconstitutional.
i
do
not
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes.
i
think
that
we
should
make
it
clear
to
the
court
because
i
do
not
see
how
this
question
was
missed,
but
i
think
it
was
surely
clear
to
the
court
that
we
are
talking
about
corporations
that
are
authorized
to
do
business
in
texas
not
unauthorized
because
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
story
i
think.
and
they
do
have
a
fixed
place
of
business
in
texas.
they
do
have
a
designated
process
agent.
now,
in
the
saunders
case
this
court
decide
in
1927,
held
that
for
venue
purposes
there
is
just
no
constitutional
basis
for
extinguishing
between
a
domestic
and
an
authorized
foreign
corporation.
i
do
not
know
what
my
time
situation
is,
except
i
will
be
advised
here,
but
i
believe
that
it
probably
be
appropriate
if
i
or
let
that,
not
a
distinguished
associate
from
word
go
in
answer
to
the
next
set
of
question,
but
before
i
do
let
me
say
this
i
--
you
will
pardon
me
personal
reference,
i
am
a
family
of
six
generations
in
texas.
i
really
feel
that
i
am
on
a
sound
ground
of
saying
that
--
that
this
invidious
discrimination
is
something
more
than
just
being
inhospitable
to
foreign
corporation.
regrettably
so
it
is
more
than
that.
we
think
it
does
what
mr.
justice
brennan
was
talking
about
in
bowers,
i
believe
when
he
spoke
of
the
disruption
of
federalism
and
we
think
this
kind
of
discrimination
is
disruptive
of
federalism.
i
know
around
the
navy
club,
you
know
they
changed
the
name
of
the
room,
strangers
room,
it
has
been
changed
to
visitors
room
and
that
is
somewhat
more
hospitable,
but
we
do
believe
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
hospitality
that
it
is
disruptive
of
federalism.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
very
limited
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
remark
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
as
to
whether
a
corporation
were
treated
differently,
foreign
and
domestic,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
they
were
treated
differently,
but
attempted
to
make
it
as
equal
as
possible
and
i
would
really
rather
thought
that
the
concept
of
separate
but
equal
had
been
a
long
and
since
dissipated.
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
right
to
choose
initially,
not
only
the
forum,
but
the
exception.
he
could
pick
four
or
five
of
them
if
you
wanted
to
and
he
did
in
this
case,
he
picked
two,
subdivision
23
and
subdivision
27.
but
in
actual
trial
--
plea
of
privilege,
he
elected
to
stand
only
on
27.
why?
because
if
he
had
tried
to
stand
on
23,
he
would
have
had
to
prove
the
cause
of
action,
it
is
his
choice.
i
do
feel
that,
it
will
be
useful
to
say
and
to
establish
although
i
do
not
see
it
on
one
of
justice’s
remark,
the
statute
itself
refers
to
a
principal
office
in
a
state
and
that
is
a
question
of
fact.
in
this
case
it
was
asserted
in
a
verified
plea
that
it
was
dallas.
that
was
not
consequent.
it
would
have
been
no
problem,
would
be
no
problem,
if
the
court
ruled
the
other
way,
we
are
going
to
dallas.
i
do
feel
that
it
might
be
desirable
and
if
the
court
would
give
us
leave
to
furnish
the
court
with
a
brief
on
the
jurisdictional
question
which
several
of
the
justices
asked.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
before
closing
finally
your
honor,we
believe
that
the
exxon
case
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
substantially,
yes
sir.
it
was
a
venue
of
question
and
it
came
up
here,
proper
jurisdiction
was
voted.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir,
that
is
right,
but
exxon,
exxon
likewise
was
the
question
where
the
plea
of
privilege
was
overruled.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no
sir.
the
appellant
filed
his
brief
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted.
appellant
filed
his
brief
and
i
do
not
think,
the
question
was
briefed
beyond
what
is
just
ordinary
is
and
then
the
plaintiff
withdrew.
i
have
got
the
exact
language
that
he
used
and
this
court
then
sent
it
back
to
the
courts
of
appeal
in
texas
for
determination
on
whether
or
not
it
was
moot.
that
court
determined
it
was
moot
and
transferred
to
harris
county
from
belmont
where
it
was
originally
filed.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
no
sir,
did
not
dismiss
it.
mr.
justice
keith
in
that
case
actually
got
it
back,
struggled
with
that
problem
quite
a
bit
and
wrote
an
opinion
on
it.
it
was
a
problem
for
him
,but
that
is
what
he
did.
we
would
feel
that
since
wheeling
versus
glander
came
after
saunders,
power
versus
saunders,
and
after
bain
peanut
which
expressed
the
philosophy
of
mr.
justice
holmes,
who
had
previously
dissented.
and
that
case
by
the
way,
the
bain
peanut
case
which
came
after
saunders,
i
do
not
believe
mr.
justice
holmes
discussed
saunders
at
all
in
that
opinion.
but
wheeling
came
still
further
and
while
it
was
not
a
venue
case,
i
think
that
it
has
a
very
considerable
philosophical
core
and
that
is
the
statement
that
is
made
in
there.
that
once
--
once
a
foreign
corporation
has
come
into
a
state
and
it
becomes
domesticated
and
let
me
say
that
this
insurance
corporation,
it
comes
fully
under
the
insurance
code
just
as
all
other,
all
other
insurance
companies,
domestic
or
foreign
in
texas,
but
once
a
state
has
chosen
to
domesticate
foreign
corporations,
this
is
in
wheeling
versus
glander,
571
of
337
u.s,
the
adopted
corporations
are
entitled
to
equal
protection
with
the
states’
own
corporate
progeny
and
this
was
attached
case
and
they
said
at
least
to
the
extent
that
having
the
same
tax
basis,
but
we
believe
the
basic
philosophy
of
that
statement
does
govern.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
do
not
i
believe
i
gave
a
helpful
oral
argument
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
i
can
refer
to
in
texas
cases
on
its
being
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
appeal,
but
i
do
not
have
in
mind
supreme
court
cases
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
if
the
court
will
grant
us
leave
we
will
undertake
--
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
yes
sir.
mr.
joel
w.
westbrook
thank
you.
