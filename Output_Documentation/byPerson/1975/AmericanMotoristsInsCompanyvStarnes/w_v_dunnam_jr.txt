mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
in
view
of
the
fact
apparently
that
justices
are
not
too
familiar
with
the
localized
plea
of
privilege
of
venue
practice
in
texas,
to
give
you
actually
a
clearer
view
point
of
what
it
actually
is
about
there.
in
the
20’s,
this
stuff
about
a
jury
trial,
in
the
27
years
so
that
our
practice
just
continuous
trial
practice
through
the
years,
i
have
yet
to
for
the
first
time
to
ever
try
a
plea
of
privilege
before
a
jury
and
actually
i
have
yet
to
hear
one
ever
being
tried
though
there
instances
during
this
history
of
the
state
where
it
has
occurred
and
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
well,
if
the
lawyer
or
defendant
demanded
a
jury
trial
then
the
court
would
put
in
the
trial
on
the
merits
at
the
same
time
and
for
that
reason
they
never
demand
a
jury
trial
because
then
you
just
try
the
whole
case
and
he
would
not
get
his
plea
of
privilege
trial.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
either
party
could
demand
it
but
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
either
party
can.
i
believe
just
the
defendant.
it
is
something
--
it
is
about
--
it
is
been
20
years
since
i
have
even
heard
that
question
of
a
jury
trial
brought
up
in
the
thing.
now,
about
the
burden
of
proof
which
justice
stewart
suggested
possibly
was
prime
facie
case.
technically,
legally,
according
to
decision,
this
preponderance
of
the
evidence
as
a
matter
of
actual
truth
and
fact
and
then
in
factual
analysis
that
is
simply
a
matter
prima
facie
proof.
actually,
the
way
the
practice
goes,
the
man
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case.
he
does
not
show
anything
other
than
a
prima
facie
case.
the
trial
judge,
i
have
never
known
of
one
to
decide
it
just
on
of
weighing
the
evidence
and
actual
facts.
if
he
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
the
plea
of
privilege
is
overruled.
that
was
a
law
for
many,
many
years
in
the
state
of
texas.
then
they
changed
it
to
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
of
course,
trial
court
is
being
jealous
of
their
own
jurisdiction,
generally
if
a
man
filed
a
case
in
this
court,
if
he
shows
that
there
was
a
collation
and
his
clients
says
the
light
was
green
for
him
or
other,
the
defendant
takes
his
stand
which
they
never
do.
the
defendant
never
puts
any
evidence
on
his
own
plea
of
privilege,
only
agrarians.
so
i
do
not
believed
in
27
years
i
have
ever
had
it
happen.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
if
venue
is
established.
now
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
no.
no
your
honor.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
he
just
overrules
a
plea
of
privilege.
now,
justice
rehnquist
brought
up
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
--
and
when
mr.
westbrook
responded
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
--
the
whole
plea
of
privilege,
the
purpose
and
objective
of
the
state
legislature
in
this
instance
is
to
give
our
defendant
an
opportunity
to
see
what
cause
of
action
is,
throw
out
frivolous
lawsuits.
and
of
course
that
has
no
bearing
on
it
whatsoever
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
legislature.
for
the
reason
that
justice
rehnquist
point
it
out
are
probably
50%
of
your
grounds,
your
exceptions
to
exclusive
venue
in
the
county
one's
residence
are
based,
have
no
relationship
to
cause
of
action.
in
the
words,
any
suit
involving
the
title
to
real
estate
or
remove
a
clout
of
title,
if
that
is
the
suit
by
its
pleadings
alone,
that
is
the
suit,
you
do
not
have
to
establish
a
cause
of
action
whatsoever
and
cause
of
action
has
no
bearing
on
it.
if
i
sue
john
doe
from
running
over
my
dog,
it
really
means
all
i
have
to
do,
he
files
for
a
plea
of
privilege,
all
i
have
to
do
is
come
in
and
prove
that
he
lives
in
the
county
were
the
suit
is,
cause
of
action
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
whatsoever.
all
i
have
to
do
is
establish
--
that
was
the
county
of
his
resonance
in
regard
to
corporation,
any
corporation,
domestic
or
foreign.
this
business
of
a
cause
of
action
applies
as
to
either.
anytime
you
sue
a
corporation
in
the
state
of
texas,
all
you
have
to
do
to
establish
venue
if
--
in
the
county
of
your
suit
is
to
establish
that
the
fact
that
your
cause
of
action
of
a
part
thereof,
it
says
to
domestic
or
foreign
that
your
cause
of
action
or
a
part
thereof
which
means
if
it
is
a
contract,
that
the
contract
was
entered
into
or
performance
or
breach
occurred
here,
any
part
of
that
cause
of
action
or
your
damages
occurred
in
this
county
or
your
initial
negligence
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
i
say
as
to
this
--
this
one
ground
of
exception
to
venue
in
the
county
of
one’s
residence.
that
is
not
common.
section
23
provides
as
to
domestic
corporations,
you
can
hold
them
in
any
county
where
a
cause
of
action
or
a
part
there
of
arose.
as
to
a
foreign
corporation
the
same
identical
provision
exists.
now
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
what
i
just
gave
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
other
words
in
23
and
27,
you
can
hold
either
one
where
identical
that
provision
and
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
in
a
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
no
sir.
no.
you
cannot
just
establish
venue
in
a
county
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
if,
if
--
of--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
--
i
mean
that
is
the
second
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
i
am
speaking
of
this
clause.
23
and
25
have
--
each
one
has
about
3,
or
4
separate
clauses,
that
is
what
i
am
getting
at.
they
have
one
in
common,
the
cause
of
action
or
part
thereof.
that
is
setup
of
the
separate
clause
as
to
each.
alright,
now
the
commercial
standard
versus
adams,
we
agree
with
the
rule
--
the
decision
in
that
case.
however,
in
our
brief
we
feel
that
the
court
there
did
not
see
it
as
concise
as
is
it
actually
--
the
actual
question
was.
in
that
case
they
just
discussed
overall
question
proposed
here
by
mr.
westbrook.
simply
is
it
an
invidious
discrimination
to
provide
that
you
can
merely
--
that
you
can
hold
a
domestic
corporation
by
--
of
having
to
prove
an
agency
and
a
cause
of
action
and
then
as
to
a
foreign
just
an
agency,
but
here
is
the
way
we
read
these
two
statutes.
the
first,
23
as
to
domestic
corporations,
we
have
got
the
common
clause.
we
set
that
out
of
the
way,
that
is
in
common,
i
cannot
make
a
complaint
about
that.
either
one
can
be
held
wherever
cause
of
action
or
part
arose.
alright,
set
that
aside.
now
,let
us
go
over
to
the
next.
here
is
where
mr.
westbrook’s
complain
is.
as
to
the
domestic
corporations
the
statute
provides
that
they
can
be
held
where
their
principal
office
is.
now
that
means
their
principal
office
in
fact
are
the
one
designated
in
texas.
now,
of
course
a
--
now
we
are
going
to
this
next
clause.
a
domestic,
you
can
hold
them
where
their
principal
office
is;
alright,
a
domestic
corporation,
their
principal
office
is
of
course
in
the
state
of
texas
generally.
that
is
where
their
officers
meet.
that
is
where
their
records
are
kept.
that
is
where
their
directors
meet.
that
is
where
their
officers
function,
their
primary
functioning
office
in
the
state
of
texas.
there
is
no
such
thing
over
here
to
correlate
as
to
foreign
corporation.
their
office
is
up
in
detroit,
michigan
maybe.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
alright
and
we
want
to
treat
as
equally
as
we
can
possibly
do
consistent
with
the
differences
at
reasonably
equal
consistent
with
the
differences.
alright,
we
got
the
domestic
where
it
has
its
principal
office
of
business.
we
can
not
hold
a
foreign
it
is
a
principal
place
of
business.
it
is
out
of
state.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
alternatives
but
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
we
recognize
that
as
a
possibility.
a
delaware
corporation
may
get
a
charter
up
there.
it
is
a
rarity,
once
in
probably
10,000
corporations
have
all
their
meetings
and
functions
right
there
in
texas
and
some
states
do
not
permit
that.
but
that
is
a
rarity.
actually
we
cannot
duplicate,
have
a
duplication,
so
what
is
the
next
closest
thing
to
equality
with
the
domestic
corporation.
texas
has
concluded
and
rightly
so,
that
domestic
has
its
primary
principal
office
with
all
of
its
functions
there,
you
can
hold
them
there.
the
foreign
does
not.
what
is
the
next
closest
thing
for
a
foreign
corporation?
it
is
this,
where
it
has
an
agency
and
representative,
not
just
an
agent
or
representative,
but
one
of
a
fixed
and
a
permanent
nature,
that
is
where
the
texas
supreme
court
has
construed
that
provision.
so
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
insurance
company
of
course,
it
is
a
foreign
insurance
company,
i
am
sure
its
main
office
is
probably
not
in
dallas.
it
is
in
some
other
state.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
record
does
not
show
that
your
honor
and
i
--
i
do
not
know
whether
that
even
has
it.
it
would
be
a
terrific
element
of
proof
to
try
to
establish,
say
some
insurance
company
in
nevada
state,
they
have
got
agencies
all
over
texas.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
alright.
i
will
get
to
that
your
honor.
the
principal
office
is
this.
what
you
raise
there
as
a
primary,
is
this
texas
statute.
avenue
insurance
company
has
an
office
in
houston.
it
is
a
foreign
company.
they
have
got
a
big
office
in
dallas.
they
have
got
one
at
odessa
and
one
at
the
lubbock.
which
one
is
the
principal
office?
they
have
got
an
agency,
a
fixed
permanent
agency
operating
out
of
all
four
places
and
they
covered
large
and
broad
areas
which
is
there
principal
office.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
if
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
they
would
have
to
hold
it
as
according
actual
primary
office
instead
of
their
designation
for
this
reason.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
alright
sir
and
here
is
what
would
happen.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
absolutely.
and
here
is
what
would
happen.
it
would
be
unfair
to
every
litigant
in
texas.
i
will
tell
you
why.
there
are
small
counties
in
texas
where
80%
of
the
populations
are
railroad
employees
like
palestine,
texas,
that
county.
the
railroads
would
all
designate
--
they
would
designate
that
county,
though
it
is
not
their
actual
primary
function
and
purpose.
it
could
not
succeed
in
a
judgment
against
them.
then
insurance
companies
would
all
designate
dallas,
texas,
whether
that
was
their
actual
main
operation
or
not.
some
companies
would
designate
the
--
some
county
in
the
remote
big
bend
county
where
it
be
prohibitive
for
anyone
to
sue
them,
it
is
a
far,
it
is
the
most
remote
area
in
the
state
of
texas,
miles
of
--
equivalent
of
going
to
across
four,
five
of
these
states
up
here.
and
the
--
it
would
be
un-functional,
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
citizens
of
texas.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
your
honor,
what?
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
but
texas
holds
it
to
their
principal
office
in
fact.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
principal
office
in
black’s
dictionary
is
generally
-
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
they
designate
an
agent
for
service
and
pay
a
franchise
tax.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
probably
the
--
generally
most
of
them
have
a
ct
corporations
in
some
building
in
dallas,
texas.
but
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
i
do
not
--
that
they
do
not
have
to.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
but,
there
would
be
a
black
pay
if
that
determined
where
their
principal
office
was.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
well,
but
--
it
is
easy
to
determine
a
domestic
corporation
because
that
is
the
home
office
of
the
company.
generally
they
have
to
have
some
home
office
and
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
right.
there
are
some
instances
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
if
that
was
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
it
probably
would
be
in
that
instance.
but
if
they
put
one
up
in
dallas
and
two
or
three
other
places
what
would
be
the
--
a
similar
building.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
exactly
correct.
that
is
why
mr.
black
defines
a
principal
office
of
a
corporation,
where
they
maintain
their
permanent
records
and
where
their
principals
officers
are
and
where
their
boards
generally
meet
those,
of
course
sometimes
they
have
a
meeting
at
vegas,
and
stuff
like
this
for
vacation
purposes.
their
primary
--
their
primary
board
room
and
so
forth
and
all
the
various
aspects
of
the
corporate
function.
now,
the
venue
--
the
texas
venue
statute
provides
a
railroad
can
be
held
wherever
it
has
a
track
running
in
texas.
the
final
shot
of
the
whole
thing
is,
as
stated
by
this
court
many
times,
if
the
classification
is
based
on
some
differences
that
reasonably
apply
and
are
pertinent
to
the
basis
for
which
the
classification
is
made
then
it
is
not
arbitrary,
it
is
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
equal
protection
laws.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
was
a
case,
that
was
a
case
where
--
they
just
provided
a
personal
injury
action.
you
can
sue
a
foreign
corporation
just
any
place
in
the
state.
there
was
no
--
the
classification
did
not
relate
to
the
distinction
made
to
the
subject
of
the
distinction
of
the
differences
and
so
forth.
the
--
in
other
words,
that
would
like
providing
a
--
well,
fro
instance
railroad
where
it
got
a
track,
that
has
some
relationship
to
the
function,
state
wide
function
for
reasonable
basis
of
--
it
is
familiar
with
those
grounds,
it
is
functioning
in
them.
therefore,
it
is
a
reasonable
basis
to
hold
it
there,
though
it
may
have
agencies
at
various
places,
but
of
courses
a
much
greater
argument
could
be
made
on
that.
you
could
argue
that,
it
is
just
like
saying
trucking
line
is
sueable
wherever
there
is
a
highway
in
the
state,
that
is
substantially
summary.
but,
the
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
well,
in
texas
a
plea
of
privileges
is
an
interlocutory
ruling
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
--
of
the
state
of
texas
does
not
have
jurisdiction
of
an
order
on
a
plea
of
privilege
except
in
certain
instances
where
there
is
a
conflict
of
decisions
or
where
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
on
certified
question
because
it
is
not,
it
is
an
interlocutory
order.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
i
have
not
claimed
that
in
the
brief
that
it
is
a
question
--
there
are
some
serious
question
about
it.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
but
i
did
not
--
this
is
a
matter
--
i
feel
that
as
short
as
our
brief
is
that
that
gets
to
the
heart
of
this
thing
and
the
texas
court
has
--
we
would
like
a
final
decision
on
to
by
this
court.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
well,
he
cited
adam’s
case
enough
and
it
attacked
its
rationality
which
we
think
is,
is
accurate.
however,
we
feel
that
--
i
feel
--
the
reason
we
presented
this
in
this
brief
like
i
said,
the
only
question
actually
before
this
court
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
whether
or
not
it
is
a
rational
distinction
where
you
give
a
(inaudible)
whatever
cause
of
action
is
that
you
take
another
clause,
you
say
the
domestic
can
be
held
where
it
has
its
principal
office.
then
in
order
to
equalize
this,
they
say
you
can
hold
a
foreign
corporation
wherever
it
has
a
--
it’s
a
primary
office
or
wherever
it
has
an
agency
or
representative
and
the
texas
supreme
court
construes
that
domain
a
fixed
permanent
agency
in
the
state
of
texas
and
we
say
those
are
equivalents
and
they
are
as
close
to
equivalence
as
anyone
could
actually
bring
about.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
texas
has
always
held
that
these
are
interlocutory
orders
or
statutory
jurisdiction.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
no,
i
know
we
cannot.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
none
whatsoever
except
the
fact
that
the
reason
i
did
not
raise
it,
back
this
court
did
note
probable
jurisdiction
back
in
this
case
one
time
when
it
presented
there
is
conflict.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
opinion
in
texas.
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
but
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
state
interest,
your
honor.
the
state
interest
is
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
trying
to
equalize
it.
i
will
say
that
--
that
where
a
domestic
corporation,
a
logical
place
to
sue
it
is
a
place
where
its
primary
office
is.
i
say
you
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
that
is
a
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
what
i
am
trying
to
make
--
i
feel
his
brief
misses
the
end
of
the
whole
thing
and
it
might
have
thrown
a
salvo.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
you
--
we
would
treat
them.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
we
treat
them
differently,
but
as
close
to
equally
as
can
be
possibly
be
done.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
we
do
not
allow
the
domestic
corporation
to
have
the
--
the
mini
trial
on
a
cause
of
action.
where
we
allege
--
it
is
a
primary
office
is
dallas
county
and
we
sue
him
in
dallas
county.
primary
office
in
fact,
all
we
have
to
do
is
prove
its
primary
office
in
dallas
county.
alright.
as
to
a
domestic
it
has
no
primary
office,
generally.
so
the
nearest
the
thing
to
it
--
without
a
--
it
just
prove
that
it
has
a
fixed,
permanent
agency
in
that
county.
that
is
what
a
foreign
corporation
will
have
in
place
of
its
primary
voting
office
and
so
forth
and
officers.
a
fixed,
a
permanent
place
of
business
and
we
prove
that
--
not
just
it
has
some
agent
living
down
there,
but
it
has
a
fixed
agency
of
a
permanent
nature
in
that
county.
did
we
not
have
established
it?
there
is
no
mini
trial
required
as
to
them.
there
was
no
mini
trial
required
as
to
the
domestic
corporation
as
to
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
thing.
that
is
our
position.
these
are
the
two
pluralities.
in
other
words,
he
has
tried
to
take
this
other
additional
ground
of
venue
which
the
domestic
corporation
as
his
honor
justice
stewart
pointed
out
a
while
ago
the
domestic
corporation
in
this
additional
ground
over
here,
he
is
talking
about
where
you
have
to
prove
a
cause
of
action.
that
is
an
additional
ground
to
hold
a
domestic
corporation.
in
addition
to
these
deals
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
you
can
hold
a
domestic
corporation
where
it
--
or
where
the
plaintiff
resides
and
it
holds
that
you
could
have
to
hold
a
foreign
corporation
where
the
plaintiff
resides
you
have
also
got
to
prove
that
the
cause
of
action
occurred
where
the
plaintiff
resided
or
that
the
cause
of
that
--
or
you
could
hold
him
in
the
nearest
county
of
which
he
has
an
agent
to
where
the
plaintiff
lives.
that
is
initial
ground,
additional
ground
of
that
you
have
got
to
prove
additional
burden
to
the
hold
a
foreign
corporation
that
you
do
not
have
to
place
on
a
domestic
corporation.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
i
think
they
were
correct
in
their
dissent,
but
i
do
not
think
that
case
is
anywhere
informed.
that
did
not
--
there
was
no
distinction
made
there.
there
is
no
--
it
is
just
wherever,
wherever
you
want
to
sue
a
foreign
corporation
does
not
relate
to
where
they
have
an
operation
going
there,
a
fixed
permanent
operation
or
primary
office
or
anything,
just
sue
him
anywhere.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
there
reasoning
is
accurate,
but
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
needed
in
this
case
because
this
is
a
--
we
have
texas
in
this
case
all
of
the
--
all
they
have
done
is
provided,
going
further
and
place
additional
grounds,
you
can
hold
a
domestic
just,
but
to
hold
a
foreign
corporation
in
addition
to
proving
the
plaintiff
as
there
you
have
got
to
prove
a
cause
of
action
there
to
and
as
to
domestic
just
prove
the
plaintiff
if
he
object
and
then
the
pluralities
are
up
here
higher.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
alright.
well,
of
course
it
is
the
interest
of
the
state
to
be
--
that
any
person,
form
of
corporation
is
functioning
within
his
borders,
have
some
means
of
access
to
the
courts
to
write
and
redress
the
wrong.
and
--
so
everyone
should
be
suable
in
some
county
and
it
is
the
interest
of
the
state
to
do
it
with
reason
provided
for
some
protection
to
the
person
sued
that
he
might
be
in
an
area
where
he
is
not
a
total
foreigner,
where
they
cannot
harass
him
by
filing
the
suit
over
into
big
bend
county,
on
a
man
in
dallas,
but
likewise
it
is
the
interest
of
the
state
that
litigants
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
present
their
case
to
a
forum
within
some
reasonable
relationship
to
the
functioning
company
involved
and
where
as
long
as
they
restrict
it
to
a
domestic
--
no
way
i
can
think
up
or
you
could
treat
them
more
equally.
if
you
are
going
to
let
a
domestic
corporation
be
sued
wherever
its
principal
office
is,
without
regard
to
where
the
wrong
occurred
or
claim
wronged
or
anything
of
that
nature,
then
the
only
way
you
could
closely
relate
up
a
foreign
corporation
to
the
same
category
would
be
to
provide
as
texas
has
done
that
it
can
be
held
wherever
--
it
has
a
fixed
agency
and
representative.
and
then
those
are
equivalents
as
close
as
it
could
be
possibly
set
--
be
set
out.
and
we
think
that
it
is
reasonable,
it
is
rational,
it
is
the
only
way
you
could
equivalently
treat
them.
if
you
provide
that
foreign
corporation
can
be
sued
where
its
principal
place
of
business
is
and
that
if
--
and
a
foreign
or
domestic
corporation
likewise
did
not
provide
that
foreign
could
be
sued
where
it
had
an
actual
permanent
fixed
place
of
business
in
texas
then
you
would
be
treating
the
domestic
corporation,
you
can
hold
them
wherever
there
principal
place
of
office,
businesses,
but
you
could
not
touch
the
foreign
corporation
where
its
principal
was
and
you
could
not
touch
him
any
place
else
though
they
have
got
their
actual
prime
of
fixed
place
right
there
in
texas
and
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
they
had
what,
your
honor?
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct.
but
--
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
well,
i
guess
they
want
to
treat
foreign
corporations
on
an
equal
--
as
far
as
possible
with
the
domestic
and
you
do
not
have
to
prove
a
cause
of
action
to
hold
a
foreign
corporation
where
its
office
is
and
likewise
you
should
not
have
to
prove
one
to
hold
a
--
i
mean,
the
domestic
corporation
where
its
office
is
and
where
a
foreign
corporation
its
office
in
texas,
you
ought
not
to
have
a
proof
of
cause
of
action
to
wholly
limit
that.
mr.
w.
v.
dunnam,
jr.
well.
you
could
hold
either
one
of
them
where
a
cause
of
action
occurred,
and
you
could
hold
either
one
of
them
where
the
plaintiff
resides
plus
you
got
to
prove
a
little
more
on
the
foreign
and
you
could
hold
the
local
or
wherever
their
principal
office
is,
but
the
foreign
does
not
have
any
office
you
could
hold
the
in
until
they
initiated
that
in
actual
practice,
for
truth
and
practice.
there
is
at
out--of--state,
they
got
--
they
might
have
to
or
three
huge
offices,
the
very
places
in
texas,
you
cannot
differentiate
which
is
the
biggest
and
which
is
the
volume
or
otherwise.
