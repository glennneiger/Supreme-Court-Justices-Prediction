that
was
a
texas
supreme
court
case,
was
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
possible
to
say
that
your
opponent
does
not
rely
on
adams,
he
does
not
cite
it
in
his
brief?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
you
are
suggesting
we
should
have
postponed
jurisdiction
rather
than
noted
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
follow
with
you
with
another
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
intimated?
would
you
explain
for
us
just
what
a
preliminary
venue
hearing
amounts
to
in
texas
as
far
as
a
domestic
corporation
is
concerned?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
feel
that
that
words
unequal
protection
as
between
domestic
and
foreign
corporations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
are
saying
he
does
not
have
to
bear
that
with
respect
to
a
foreign
corporation,
and
therefore,
no
equal
protection?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
would
not
be
content
with
a
mere
transfer
of
the
case
to
dallas
or
tarrant
county?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
the
statute
limitations
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
point
of
the
finality
of
the
judgment
here,
i
take
it
you
are
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
taking
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court
for
this
review
at
this
point.
i
do
not
read
your
brief
that
way?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
wonder
why
you
did
not
do
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
your
brief
is,
it
seems
to
me
it
does
not
touch
upon
it
and
this
raises
--
this
brings
me
to
my
other
question.
i
take
it
if
you
are
not
relying
on
the
adamâ€™s
case.
you
do
not
cite
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we
transferred
it
then,
we
did
not
dismiss
it?
