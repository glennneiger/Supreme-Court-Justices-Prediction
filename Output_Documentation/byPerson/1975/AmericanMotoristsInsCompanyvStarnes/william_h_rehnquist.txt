justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
westbrook,
i
take
it
that
this
same
plaintiff
could
have
sued
a
domestic
corporation
in
mclennan
county
just
as
you
were
sued
in
mclennan
county,
since
this
plaintiff
resided
in
mclennan
county,
so
that
the
only
distinction
you
claim
as
being
made
between
the
in
state
and
out
of
state
corporations
is
the
necessity
with
respect
to
a
domestic
corporation
of
having
to
prove
a
prima
facie
case
for
the
cause
of
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
is
the
final
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
is
a
final
judgment
under
r.
28
u.s.c.?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
our
langdeau
case
where
the
court
held
that
where
a
congress
conferred
a
right
of
--
limited
the
right
to
sue
a
federal
bank,
it
would
strike
me
that
your
claim
here
--
you
are
not
claiming
a
right
that
texas
law
gives
you
to
be
sued
in
a
particular
county.
all
you
really
claiming
is
the
right
to
be
treated
identically
with
the
domestic
corporation,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
is
the
same
as
langdeau,
for
finality
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
the
texas
court
here
did
was
to
say
that
the
suit
could
proceed
against
your
company,
did
they
not?
i
mean,
that
the
suit
is
not
over?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
westbrook,
i
see
from
the
brief
that
you
have
filed,
the
appendix
to
your
brief
that
there
are
31
sections
to
the
texas
venue
code
and
there
are
obviously
distinctions
between
foreign
corporations
and
domestic
corporations
which
you
are
asking
us
to
focus
on,
but
under
section
28,
if
your
company
had
been
of
a
fire,
marine
or
inland
insurance
company,
it
would
have
been
subject
to
different
regulations
than
being
an
automobile
casualty
company.
now,
what
is
the
standard
that
we
are
supposed
to
apply
in
terms
of
equal
protection
in
determining
whether
these
31
different
provisions
for
venue
in
different
kind
of
suits
offend
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
perfectly
true,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
any
litigant
in
texas,
unless
he
happens
to
be
a
private
individual
sued
in
a
particular
kind
of
case
is
going
to
be
able
to
make
some
claim
that
he
is
treated
differently
than
either
of
the
kind
of
railroad
personal
injury
case
in
section
25
or
the
fire
and
marine
case
in
28.
what
standard
do
we
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
but
your
case
is
not
power,
is
it,
because
texas
requires
even
though
a
foreign
corporation
that
it
be
sued
only
in
the
county
where
it
has
an
agent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
could
have
sued
a
domestic
corporation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
westbrook.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
mini
trial
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
occurs
in
your
plea
of
privilege
cases
only
where
the
statute
speaks
of
the
cause
of
action
having
arisen
in
a
particular
place,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
when
the
venue
provision
does
not
depend
on
where
the
cause
of
action
arose
then
there
is
no
mini
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really,
did
not
the
texas
supreme
court
just
come
along
and
read
this
language
where
the
cause
of
action
arose
and
say
that
you
are
in
affect,
if
you
are
depending
on
that
kind
of
language
in
a
venue
statute,
you
had
to
show
that
a
cause
of
action
did
arise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
41
of
the
appellant’s
brief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
what
you
are
saying
that
a
domestic
corporation’s
home
office
has
certain
functions
associated
like
--
where
the
like
the
presence
of
a
chief
executive
officer,
the
meetings
of
the
directors
and
that
sort
of
a
thing
that
make
it
much
more
readily
identifiable
factually
than
what
might
be
one
of
several
relatively
equally
important
branch
office
of
a
foreign
corporation
that
has
its
principal
place
of
business
in
another
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
exxon
was
never
argued
here
though,
was
it
not?
