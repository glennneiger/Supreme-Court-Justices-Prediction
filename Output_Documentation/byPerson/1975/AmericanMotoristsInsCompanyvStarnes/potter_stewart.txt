what
is
it,
sort
of
a
prima
facie
case,
and
just
(inaudible)
of
plaintiff?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
greater
burden
on
the
plaintiff
where
he
has
to
do
than
it
is
on
anyone
else?
justice
potter
stewart
no
sir,
we
are
asking
this
court
to
declare
that
subdivision
27
as
it
is
applied
in
texas,
is
unconstitutional
because
it
deprives
foreign
corporations
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
in
their
what,
over
200
counties
in
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
so
there
--
it
is
the
least
possible
their
practice
might
vary
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
demand
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
plea
of
privilege
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
case
in
this
court
that
bears
on
this
most
relevantly
i
suppose
is
the
power
company
against
saunders
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
quite
understand
your
answer
to
my
brother
marshall.
you
conceded
in
response
to
his
question
that
up
until
sometime
in
the
1940â€™s,
domestic
corporations
and
foreign
corporations
were
treated
precisely
alike
under
the
same
statute
and
as
i
understood
you,
in
any
civil
why
do
they
--
why
do
think
the
legislature
changed
it
and
your
answer
was,
in
order
to
treat
them
alike.
it
does
not
--
i
missed
something
there.
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
that
our
court
has
jurisdiction
which
depends
upon
whether
or
not
this
is
the
final
judgment
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
of
texas?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
be
interested
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
how
did
the
exxon
case,
was
it
in
the
same
procedural
posture
as
this
one?
justice
potter
stewart
that
actually
it
was
in
the
same
procedural
posture?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
arkansas
case,
power
company
case
did
not
--
that
was
a
final
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
after
a
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
proper
jurisdiction
was
noted.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
possibility
of
filing
a
written
document
directed
to
the
issue
of
our
jurisdiction.
do
you
have
any
views
on
it
orally
beyond
those
you
have
given
us?
have
you
(voice
