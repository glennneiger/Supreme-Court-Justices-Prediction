powell,

assume
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
the
defendant
had
been
engaged
in
selling
heroin,
say,
for
months
or
years,
but
the
particular
batch
of
heroin
that
he
was
being
prosecuted
for
having
sold,
had
been
supplied
by
government
agent.
would
your
position
be
different?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
advocating
a
per
se
rule
regardless
of
all
other
facts
and
circumstances
if,
and
only
if,
the
contraband
that
is
involved
in
the
particular
prosecution
was
supplied
by
the
government?
