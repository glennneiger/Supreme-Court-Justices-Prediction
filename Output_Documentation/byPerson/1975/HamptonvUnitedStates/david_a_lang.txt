mr.
david
a.
lang
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
david
lang
and
i
am
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
charles
hampton,
jr.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
a
judgment
a
jury
verdict
finding,
the
defendant
guilty
of
two
counts
of
distributing
heroin
in
violation
of
federal
law.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows:
petitioner
charles
hampton
was
initially
charged
in
a
two-count
indictment
with
violation
of
section
84191
of
title
21
of
the
united
states
code,
with
knowingly
and
intentionally
distributing
approximately
three
grams
of
heroin.
at
the
trial,
the
government
introduced
testimony
of
five
witnesses
in
this
case
in
chief
and
three
witnesses
in
rebuttal.
only
three
of
the
government’s
witnesses’
testimonies
are
presently
before
this
court.
hampton
likewise
also
introduced
the
testimony
of
five
witnesses
including
himself,
and
only
his
testimony
appears
in
the
record.
basically,
without,
to
think
the
facts
are
fairly
well
set
out
in
the
brief,
but
just
to
give
some
background
on
them.
basically,
the
government’s
first
witness
was
a
jules
hutton
who
was
a
special
employee
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
he
testified
that
he
had
been
involved
in
some
80
or
90
drug
cases
in
wichita,
kansas,
lawrence,
kansas
and
st.
louis
area.
he
had
just
gotten
into
st.
louis
and
his
job
was
to
make
contact
with
the
persons
who
were
involved
in
drug
trafficking
and
to
set
up
sales
with
agents
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration.
he
testified
that
in
business
that
he
was
approached
by
the
defendant
hampton
who
initiated
the
scheme
for
selling
drugs,
and
basically
there
were
two
sales
that
occurred.
one
occurred
on
february
25,
1974;
the
other
occurred
on
february
26,
the
following
day.
the
first
sale
took
place
and
at
that
sale
a
second
sale
was
set
up.
on
date
of
the
following
sale
february
26,
the
sale
was
consummated
and
the
two
persons
who
purchased
the
drugs
then
identified
themselves
as
being
federal
narcotics
agents
and
placed,
both
the
defendant
and
jules
hutton,
the
informant,
under
arrest
at
that
particular
time.
that
was
basically
the
story
that
was
given
by
hutton.
now,
the
contradiction
came
in
with
respect
hampton’s
testimony.
his
testimony
was
basically
that
all
of
the
drug
transactions
were
initiated
not
be
himself
but
by
hutton,
the
government’s
informant.
he
has
further
testified
that
at
no
time
did
any
of
the
substances
which
he
sale
--
rather
all
the
substances
which
he
sold
had
been
supplied
to
him
by
hutton.
that
he
had
no
independent
source
of
supply
of
these
drugs.
the
question
basically
was
a
question
of
credibility
between
the
two
witnesses.
at
the
trial,
we
moved
for
a
special
jury
entrapment,
a
special
jury
instruction
on
the
defense
of
entrapment.
this
was
based
upon
the
so-called
government
conduct
theory
of
entrapment.
and
the
focus
of
that
theory
is
that
one
does
not
focus
of
course
upon
the
predisposition
of
the
defendant
but
rather
upon
the
extent
of
the
governmental
participation
in
the
crime.
the
district
court
refused
to
give
the
requested
instruction
on
the
ground
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
united
states
versus
russell
precluded
any
entrapment
defense
based
upon
any
principle
other
than
predisposition.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
decision
on
the
ground
that
it
felt
it
was
also
precluded.
there
was
one
dissenting
opinion.
therefore
the
basic
issue
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
forbids
the
conviction
of
an
accused
for
selling
contraband
if
the
contraband
was
supplied
to
him
by
an
agent
acting
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
government.
previous
opinions
of
this
court
starting
with
sorrells
and
culminating
with
the
russell
decision
in
1973,
we
believe
not
to
reach
the
specific
issue.
we
believe
this
issue
neither
was
nor
reached
in
russell
and
russell
is
distinguishable
and
this
is
a
totally
different
situation.
mr.
david
a.
lang
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
lang
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
in
which
this
precise
issue
has
been
raised
both
in
state
court
cases
and
federal
cases.
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
russell,
every
court
that
it
passed
on
the
issue
of
contraband
being
supplied
to
the
defendant
and
that
was
subject
of
the
offense
had
ruled
that
that
constituted
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
now
a
careful
analysis
of
those
cases
i
believe,
the
courts
used
various
languages.
some
cases
use
the
term
entrapment;
some
cases
--
the
court
did
not
specify
what
exactly,
what
doctrine
they
were
purporting
to
utilize
on
those
cases.
i
think
this
cases
can
best
be
analyzed
if
they
are
viewed
a
due
process
cases.
and
--
mr.
david
a.
lang
this
was
judge
nangle.
we
did
not
request
the
traditional
predisposition
entrapment
instruction;
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
only
requested
this
so-called
government
conduct,
theory
of
entrapment
or
whatever
one
wants
to
term
it.
the
reason
for
that
in
this
particular
instance
was
that
the
offense
was
knowingly
and
intentionally
distributing
heroin.
so
the
issue
of
scienter
was
already
before
the
jury.
if
they
believe
that
this
defendant
never
knew
he
was
distributing
heroin,
they
had
ample
ground
to
find
form
on
that.
we
did
not
feel
that
we
should
confuse
the
jury
with
another
predisposition
issue.
in
other
words,
the
issue
of
scienter
goes
to
both
predisposition
and
knowledge.
mr.
david
a.
lang
on
the
question
of
knowledge,
yes
the
record
could
have
supported
that
your
honor.
but
as
i
say
it
was
strategic
move
at
that
point
not
to
confuse
the
jury
by
bringing
in
this
predisposition
when
if
they
believe
the
defendant’s
testimony,
they
would
necessarily
have
acquitted
him
on
the
grounds
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
distributing
heroin,
because
all
along
he
thought
the
substance
he
was
distributing
was
a
counterfeit
substance.
that
was
the
story
that
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
informant.
mr.
david
a.
lang
your
honor,
we
are
limiting
the
standard
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
adapt
specifically
to
cases
in
which
the
government
supplies
contraband.
mr.
david
a.
lang
yes.
mr.
david
a.
lang
no,
your
honor
and
i
will
answer
that
by
approaching
it
this
way,
i
like
to
approach
it
by
stating
it
this
way.
when
the
government
supplies
contraband
to
a
defendant,
it
is
necessarily
assuming
that
this
man
has
some
criminal
propensity
that
he
is
going
to
commit
and
offense
involving
the
contraband
in
the
future.
there
is
an
implicit
presumption.
that
is
the
only
presumption
that
can
justify
supply
and
contraband.
if
the
man
does
not
want
to
sell
contraband
in
the
government
has
no
right
to
test
him
or
to
aid
him
under
the
traditional
doctrine.
so
there
is
a
finding;
there
is
a
necessary
relied
on
presumption
when
the
contraband
is
supplied
that
he
was
going
to
sell
it
anyway.
he
was
going
to
get
his
own
source
of
the
contraband
and
sell
it.
mr.
david
a.
lang
well.
mr.
david
a.
lang
well,
no
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
contraband
first
of
all
because
an
item
has
been
labeled
contraband
by
congress,
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
that
item
is
not
generally
revealed
that
is
why
it
is
contraband.
indeed,
congress
is
trying
to
keep
it
off
the
street,
which
if
taken
hypothetical
for
example.
let
us
say,
someone
wants
to
make
a
time
bomb
and
let
us
assume
that
a
necessary
element
in
a
time
bomb
is
a
clock
or
some
type
of
time-keeping
device.
if
the
government
provide
it,
a
clock
i
will
have
no
problems
with
that.
it
is
necessary
but
we
can
assume
that
the
defendant
can
go
out
and
purchase
a
clock
anyway.
it
does
not
have
to
be
supplied.
i
am
saying
we
cannot
necessary,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
make
that
inference
when
the
contraband
is
supplied.
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
contraband
is
available
just
because
one
has
a
predisposition
to
want
to
engage
in
a
contraband
crime
that
he
would
be
able
to
get
contraband.
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
had
any
source
of
heroin
other
than
the
government.
that
was
never
brought
at
trial
what
his
source
of
the
supply
was.
mr.
david
a.
lang
well,
i
am
saying
your
honor,
certainly
at
some
point
when
a
crime
is
committed,
there
is
always
predisposition.
we
are
talking
about
a
consummated
criminal
act.
when
the
act
was
consummated,
certainly,
his
predisposition
was
one
element
what
one
calls
as
a
criminal
act.
another
element
was
the
inducement
by
the
government.
there
is
another
element
that
caused
a
consummated
act
was
supply
of
the
contraband.
all
of
these
things
caused
factually
the
consummated
criminal
act.
now,
i
am
saying
that
the
bigger
question,
if
we
look
the
fact
of
the
sale
of
the
contraband
is
saying
he
was
predisposed.
yes,
assuming
he
was
predisposed
and
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
he
could
have
gotten
contraband
from
any
of
his
source.
it
does
not
follow
as
a
matter
of
logic.
if
he
could
not
obtain
contraband
despite
his
predisposition,
he
may
have
been
deterred
from
engaging
in
a
particular
criminal
activity,
as
it
is
a
stake
possibility.
the
fact
that
it
is
contraband
means
that
it
is
difficult
or
ought
to
be
difficult
to
obtain.
it
is
not
as
available
as
many
other
substances.
in
the
russell
case,
the
substance
involved
was
propanone
which
was
an
essential
ingredient
to
making
“speed”
which
was
a
drug
that
was
involved
there
in
that
particular
case.
now
in
that
particular
case
there
are
some
factual
distinctions
there.
first
of
all,
it
was
clear
in
that
case
that
the
defendant
had
a
source
of
propanone
both
before
and
after
it
was
supplied
by
the
government.
secondly,
that
was
a
crime
involving
manufacture
of
“speed”,
and
manufacturing
involved
some
type
of
affirmative
action
on
part
of
the
person
engaging
in
crime.
you
just
do
not
take
this
substance
assuming
indispensable,
that
does
create
a
crime
in
and
of
itself,
he
had
to
do
something
actively
to
be
guilty
of
manufacturing.
mr.
david
a.
lang
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
in
that
instance
as
i
say,
with
the
clock
there
was
no
problem
because
everyone
knows
you
can
go
to
buy
a
clock.
in
the
russell
case,
there
was
no
problem
because
we
know
both
before
and
after
the
sale
the
defendant
had
its
own
source
of
the
propanone.
i
have
no
problem
joining
if
for
instance
he
could
have
gotten
those.
i
have
no
problem
with
that
government
supplied
it.
it
was
inconsequential,
but
that
is
not
case
here.
we
are
talking
about
the
presumption
that
the
government
is
relying
on
and
that
is
presumption
that
this
man
was
going
to
obtain
contraband
because
he
was
predisposed
to
engage
in
this
type
of
offense.
i
am
saying
it
does
not
follow
as
a
matter
of
logic
that
just
because
one
is
predisposed,
if
the
contraband
is
unavailable
that
you
would
therefore
engaged
in
that
crime.
mr.
david
a.
lang
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
lang
my
position
in
that
case
would
not
be
different
your
honor,
because
the
defendant
is
on
charge
for
the
sale
--
we
are
not
charging
the
man
or
holding
him
responsible
for
his
past
conduct.
the
crime
which
could
be
before
the
court
in
that
instances,
the
one
that
he
engaged
then,
and
in
that
case
whenever
the
supply
or
whenever
the
subject
of
the
offense
was
supplied
by
the
government,
i
would
say
that
regardless
of
what
he
had
done
in
the
past,
regardless
of
his
predisposition,
that
in
that
case
we
cannot
allow
his
prosecution
to
stand
or
he
cannot
be
prosecuted.
mr.
david
a.
lang
that
is
right
your
honor;
that
is
a
very
narrow
standard.
indeed,
we
have
to
set
some
outer
limits
on
the
government’s
conduct.
i
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
an
extent
to
set
out
of
limits
on
what
type
of
law
enforcement
activities
are
permissible
in
the
society.
if
i
can
set
up
another
hypothetical
that
comes
to
mind.
let
us
assume
we
have
situation
where
a
defendant
is
engaged
in
making
a
bomb,
he
is
going
to
blow
up
some
federal
buildings.
he
is
a
member
of
some
type
of
revolutionary
group,
and
his
group
was
infiltrated
by
an
agent
of
the
government,
and
this
man,
the
defendant’s
of
demolition
expert
and
he
gets
into
the
building
and
plants
the
bomb
and
has
a
change
of
heart.
he
decides
maybe
innocent
people
will
be
hurt
and
he
does
not
want
to
go
ahead
and
do
it.
and
the
government
agent
pulls
out
a
pistol
and
tells
him,
well,
you
know,
for
the
cause
you
must
do
this.
and
he
goes
ahead
and
fuses
the
bomb.
he
is
subsequently
charged
of
some
type
of
crime
relating
or
rising
out
the
incident.
now
if
we
just
focus
on
the
fact
that
he
was
predisposed
in
the
past,
there
would
be
room
for
a
jury
to
make
that
factual
finding.
i
am
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
we
might
want
to
have
some
situation
where
we
do
not
want
those
types
of
cases
going
to
the
jury.
mr.
david
a.
lang
well,
your
honor
i
am
saying
that
that
is.
i
agree
with
you
that
that
hypothetical
may
be
quite
far
off
from
what
is
in
reality,
but
i
am
saying
that
the
only
thing
that,
the
thing
the
most
closely
approximates
that
is
government
supply
a
contraband
and
from
what
i
have
seen,
that
is
the
greatest
extent
to
which
the
government
is
involved
in
a
crime
is
actually
supply
the
contraband.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is,
therefore,
a
difference
and
we
are
going
to
talk
about
joining
some
limits.
mr.
david
a.
lang
he
would
have
the
rest
but
he
should
also
have
the
defense
of
government
conduct.
i
am
saying
it
might
be
in
that
particular
instance
that
he
would
not
have
engaged
--
we
still
have
the
fact
that
he
effused
the
bomb.
that
is
a
different
fact,
just
like
we
have
in
the
case
before
the
fact
that
the
drugs
were
sold,
they
were
sold.
but
i
am
saying,
we
have
no
problems
in
the
hypothetical.
we
are
saying
that
we
do
not
know
for
a
fact
that
he
did
it
because
of
coercion
or
because
of
his
predisposition.
i
am
saying
it
is
too
great
a
danger
to
we
cannot
say
--
it
is
too
great
a
danger
to
allow
that
type
of
cases
going
to
the
jury.
i
am
saying
the
same
thing
is
true
when
we
are
talking
about
this
contraband
offense,
when
the
contraband
has
been
supplied
by
the
government.
it
is
just
too
great.
mr.
david
a.
lang
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
have
the
same
conclusion.
anytime
that
the
person
--
mr.
david
a.
lang
yes,
your
honor,
they
will
be.
i
wold
say
so,
because
what
the
government
is
doing
is
manufacturing
crime.
what
interest
does
a
government
have
--
if
the
government’s
interest
is
in
keeping
heroin
off
the
street,
what
interest
do
they
have?
mr.
david
a.
lang
well,
i
understand
it
was
a
known
pusher
but
then
why
--
the
question
comes
up
is
why
is
it
necessary
for
the
government
to
supply
him
with
the
heroin
if
he
is
a
known
pusher.
why
do
they
not
just
wait
until
he
gets
his
own
heroin?
that
is
where
we
have
to
look
at
the
problem.
if
the
man
is
a
known
pusher,
if
he
has
his
own
source,
why
can
the
government
not
just
wait
until
he
comes
up
with
his
own
source?
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
for
the
government
intervening
in
that
case.
mr.
david
a.
lang
well,
that
is
the
possibility
your
honor,
i
will
not
argue
that.
however,
when
they
do
convict
him
for
that
particular
crime,
we
still
get
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
nor
he
would
have
sold
the
heroin
without
their
intervention.
in
other
words,
i
am
still
saying
that
i
think
that
our
system
of
justice
says
that
we
have
to
give
a
man
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
this
instance.
we
are
talking
about
in
effect
--
we
are
looking
at
another
--
we
are
talking
about
cause
and
relation.
we
thought
about
it
in
tort
terms
of
cause
and
relation
and
criminal
terms.
we
have
several
acts
which
contribute
to
the
consummated
criminal
act
which
is
subject
of
the
offense.
we
have
several
things
to
contribute
to
a
one
thing
as
a
criminal
propensity
of
the
defendant.
another
thing
is
the
inducement
from
the
government
agents.
another
thing
is
the
supply
of
the
contraband.
under
the
tort
law
and
criminal
law,
there
is
instance
wherein
we
make
act
superseding
and
the
terminology
that
used
there,
superseding
intervening
causes
and
so
forth
and
relieve
liability
despite
factual
causation.
mr.
david
a.
lang
well,
i
am
saying
that
i
am
only
making
the
analogy
insofar
abd
saying
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
fact
that
we
have
several
causes
which
contribute
to
the
consummated
act.
i
am
saying
as
a
matter
of
logic,
we
do
not
know
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
able
to
complete
this
crime
but
for
the
government
supply
of
the
contraband.
and
we
have
to
use
a
more
exacting
standard
because
we
are
talking
about
a
man’s
liberty
in
this
case.
we
are
talking
about
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
i
think
the
standards
that
we
set
out
from
the
presumption
cases
that
we
cited,
i
think
the
standard
is
that
there
must
be
the
presumed,
the
ultimate
fact
must
follow
logically
from
the
proven
fact
and
must
exist
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
think
that
we
apply
that
standard
where
it
cannot
certainly
be
said
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
assuming
that
hampton
was
disposed
to
commit
the
offense
that
he
would
have
committed
it,
had
the
government
not
supply
the
contraband.
mr.
david
a.
lang
yes,
it
was
i
believe
your
honor.
the
second
aspect
of
due
process
your
honor
that
we
urge
this
court
to
adapt,
deals
with
the
question
of
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
government’s
conduct
by
supplying
the
contraband
in
this
case.
and
this
instance,
we
believe
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
for
the
government
to
provide
the
contraband.
the
government
has
no
legitimate
interest.
the
government’s
interest
is
only
in
apprehending
those
engaged
in
criminal
activity
by
the
mere
offer
of
a
neutral
opportunity.
that
is
the
standard
that
this
court
has
adapted
in
sorrells
and
sherman.
there
is
no
governmental
interest
in
intervening
in
the
contraband
trade
based
upon
anything
other
than
opportunity.
and
if
the
government
supplies
contraband
and
indeed
not
acting
within
the
bounds
of
this
legitimate
interest,
and
what
we
have
here
in
that
situation
that
the
government
is
bringing
about
a
conviction
by
the
method
of
law
enforcement
that
offense
a
general
sense
of
justice.
we
have
the
evidence
which
has
been
supplied
by
the
government
on
one
hand
and
then
they
obtain
a
conviction
based
upon
contraband.
this
is
one
of
the
impressions
of
a
shame
trial.
it
encourages
law
enforcement
officials
to
participate
in
current.
it
permits
overzealous
law
enforcement
officers
to
selectively
set
up
defendants
for
prosecution.
indeed,
this
is
just
what
hampton
is
alleging
in
this
case.
i
believe
these
evils
result
in
an
upfront
to
our
basic
notions
of
justice
in
the
society,
and
i
believe
that
applying
the
standard
from
the
rochin
case
shock
into
the
cons
of
this
court.
i
believe
that
this
type
of
conduct
should
shock
the
cons
of
this
court.
the
court
should
hold
that
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
allow
prosecution
in
this
instance.
i
would
like
to
at
this
time
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
a.
lang
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
on
the
last
issue
that
was
brought
up
to
distinction
between
informer
and
an
agent.
let
us
make
it
clear
that
the
person
involved
for
the
government
in
this
case
was
an
agent.
he
is
an
agent
provocateur.
his
job
is
to
go
out
and
find
people
who
might
be
interested
in
drug
trafficking
and
gets
them
to
make
sales
of
heroin
and
that
is
what
his
job
is.
mr.
david
a.
lang
and
he
gets
paid
per
deal.
mr.
david
a.
lang
right.
now
an
informant
is
typically
one
whom
we
think
of
a
stoolpigeon.
this
is
somebody
who
has
already
himself
engaged
in
a
criminal
activity
and
for
whatever
reason
he
decides
that
he
is
going
to
inform
the
government
about
it.
it
might
be
because
he
has
another
case
which
is
hanging
over
his
head
and
he
decides
it
might
be
his
way
out
if
he
informs
on
his
friends.
that
is
what
an
informant
does.
this
man
involved
here
is
not
an
informant.
he
is
an
agent
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government
actively
going
out
and
seeking
persons
to
engage
in
the
drug
traffic.
he
is
an
agent
provocateur.
and
as
an
agent
provocateur,
i
see
no
real
distinction
between
him
and
the
normal
government
agent.
that
is
what
their
job
is
too,
and
the
government
certainly
can
exercise
controls
over
both
of
this
types
of
person.
secondly,
mr.
jones
mentioned
that
there
might
have
situation
where
one
is
acting
--
one
might
be
engaged
in
criminal
enterprise,
let
us
say,
involved
in
drugs
and
he
decides
that
he
does
want
to
be
an
informant.
and
since
the
word
that
i
have
used,
he
wants
to
turn
state
evidence
for
his
benefit.
well,
i
am
saying
certainly,
in
that
instance
there
would
be
no
bar
of
persecution
to
the
defendant
who
is
charged
because
the
government
has
not
supplied
any
contraband
there.
we
are
not
going
to
simply
say
this
was
a
supply
of
contraband
because
this
person
has
changed
his
status.
those
cases
would
not
be
affected
at
all
by
the
standards
that
were
urged.
mr.
david
a.
lang
now,
another
thing
that
was
mentioned
here
had
to
do
with
the
question
of
indispensable
means
versus
contraband.
and
mr.
jones
used
the
term
indispensable
means
and
said
that
that
was
involved
in
the
hampton
case
here
that
the
indispensable
means
were
provided
to
this
crime.
well,
i
do
not
think
that
indispensable
means
is
the
correct
terminology.
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
providing
something
such
as
a
clock
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
or
the
propanone
in
russell
case
which
were
necessary
and
contraband
per
se.
in
the
russell
case,
the
offense
was
manufacturing
“speed”
and
in
that
particular
instance,
yes
it
was
necessary
to
have
propanone
to
do
that
but
it
also
requires
some
further
active
affirmative
action
on
the
part
of
defendant.
he
had
to
take
that
ingredient
that
was
given
and
mix
it
up.
there
is
the
evidence
of
real
predisposition
such
as
i
have
no
problem
within
informer
that
he
would
have
done
it
anyway
and
also
we
have,
as
i
indicated
before,
the
fact
that
he
did
have
his
own
propanone
both
before
and
after.
here
we
do
not
have
that.
if
i
can
go
back
to
my
original
argument
or
my
chief
argument
involving
statutory
presumptions,
the
proven
fact
in
this
case
is
that
hampton
sold
heroin,
and
yes
it
is
true
that
from
that
one
can
logically
infer
that
he
was
predispose
to
sell
heroin.
i
have
not
problems
with
that,
fine.
but
assuming
that
he
was
predisposed
does
then
follow
as
a
matter
of
logic
or
rationality
that
despite
his
predisposition
he
would
have
sold
heroin,
had
the
government
not
supplied
him.
i
say
we
do
not
know
that;
i
say
we
certainly
do
not
know
that
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
and
i
say
that
we
cannot
say
that
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
the
due
process
clause
forbids
conviction
of
any
defendant
in
these
circumstances.
thank
you
your
honor.
