mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
here
in
this
case
as
mr.
lang
stated
is
whether
to
say
per
se
denial
of
due
process
to
convict
the
defendant
for
the
sale
of
narcotics
that
he
procured
from
the
informant
or
government
agent.
there
is
a
conflict
among
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this
issue.
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
for
an
informant
or
government
agent
supplies
a
defendant
with
narcotics
for
which
the
--
for
the
sale
of
which
the
defendant
is
subsequently
arrested
and
indicted,
the
defendant
is
immune
from
prosecution
for
that
offense.
now
without
regard
to
any
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
including
the
fact
that
the
defendant
may
have
been
predisposed
to
deal
in
the
cons
of
narcotics
for
which
he
was
arrested
for
selling.
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
eighth
circuit,
rejected
this
per
se
test
and
held
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
properly
convicted,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
might
have
procured
his
heroin
here
from
a
government
informant.
because
of
the
importance
of
this
issue
to
the
administration
under
narcotics
laws,
the
united
states
acquiesced
in
the
granting
of
the
petition.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
briefly
recapitulate
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case.
i
think
there
are
four
of
them.
first,
the
petitioner
did
make
two
sales
of
heroin
to
government
undercover
agents.
second,
it
has
now
been
established
that
the
petitioner
knew
at
the
time
he
was
making
the
sales
that
the
substance
he
was
selling
was
heroin.
third,
it
is
unquestioned
that
the
petitioner
was
introduced
to
the
government
undercover
agents
by
an
informant
who
described
them
as
potential
narcotics
buyers,
and
fourth,
it
was
also
established
by
petitioner’s
counsel
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioner
was
at
all
relevant
times
predisposed
to
deal
on
heroin.
some
of
the
remaining
facts
are
still
controverted.
in
particular,
the
petitioner
testified
a
trial
that
it
was
the
informant
who
originated
the
scheme
of
selling
heroin.
whereas
the
informant
testified
to
the
contrary
that
the
scheme
originated
with
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
also
testified
that
he
obtained
his
heroin
from
the
informant.
the
informant
denied
this
and
testified
that
he
had
no
knowledge
concerning
the
petitioner’s
source
of
heroin.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
and
i
would
like
to
read
that
instruction
just
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
so
we
will
know
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
petitioner
requested
instruction
at
trial
as
follows:
“if
you
find
that
the
defendant
sales
of
narcotics
or
sales
in
narcotics
supplied
to
him
by
an
informer
and
he
employ
of
or
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government,
and
you
must
have
acquit
the
defendant,
because
the
law,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
forbids
his
conviction
in
such
a
case.
furthermore,
under
this
particular
defense,
we
need
not
consider
the
predisposition
of
the
defendant
to
commit
the
offense
charge.”
under
this
instruction
if
the
jury
had
concluded
that
the
petitioner
had
in
fact
obtained
the
heroin
that
he
sold
from
the
government
informant
and
it
would
have
been
required
to
acquit
petitioner.
and
this
would
have
been
true
no
matter
what
other
kinds
of
findings
the
jury
might
have
made.
for
example,
if
the
jury
had
concluded
that
petitioner
was
an
established
heroin
dealer
with
many
sources
of
supply
of
heroin
who
had
originated
the
scheme
of
selling
heroin
and
in
fact
demanded
heroin
from
the
informant
as
a
sign
of
good
faith
or
as
a
means
of
involving
the
informant
in
a
criminal
transaction.
nevertheless,
the
jury
would
have
been
required
to
acquit
the
petitioner
if
it
found
that
in
fact
the
informant
did
comply
with
the
demand,
did
furnish
the
contraband
in
question.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
pardon?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh
no,
that
was
disputed.
the
informant
denied
that
he
furnished
the
heroin,
so
that
the
matter
is
in
dispute
and
the
jury
made
no
finding
on
that
point.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
was
only
responding
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
i
only
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
dispute
matter
and
if
the
court
decided
that
the
instruction
should
have
been
given,
of
course,
the
proper
relief
would
be
a
new
trial,
because
that
question
is
in
dispute.
i
would
like
first
to
describe
the
relationship
that
the
petitioners
proposed
due
process
defense
bears
to
the
standard
defensive
entrapment
and
then
i
will
elaborate
a
greater
length
upon
the
reasons
for
rejecting
that
or
any
similar
defense.
the
availability
of
the
traditional
defense
of
entrapment
turns
upon
a
question
of
predisposition,
i.e.,
it
turns
upon
the
question
that
whether
the
defendant,
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
entrapment,
was
predisposed
to
commit
the
kind
of
offense
for
which
he
did
in
fact
commit.
now
the
petitioner
here
has
conceded
that
he
was
predisposed
to
commit
the
heroin
offense
with
which
he
was
charged.
and
he
has
not
attempted
to
assert
the
traditional
defense
of
entrapment
in
this
case.
but
the
defense
that
he
does
assert
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
an
entrapment
defense.
the
proper
scope
and
correct
formulation
of
the
defense
of
entrapment
has
been
much
mooted
by
the
members
of
this
court
over
the
years.
in
the
united
states
against
russell,
three
members
of
the
present
court
expressed
the
view
that
the
defensive
entrapment
should
turn
not
upon
the
subjective
factor
of
the
defendant’s
predisposition
or
rather
upon
the
objective
consideration
of
the
particular
law
enforcement
conduct.
the
entrapment
test
propounded
by
the
minority
in
russell
was
whether
the
government’s
conduct
--
and
i
quote
here
--
“whether
the
government’s
conduct
is
of
a
kind
that
could
induce
or
instigate
the
commission
of
a
crime
by
one
not
ready
and
willing
to
commit
it.”
now
we
think
it
is
fairly
clear
that
that
test
would
not
avail
petitioner
in
this
case
either.
what
he
seeks
is
recognition
of
an
absolute
defense
based
upon
the
presence
of
a
single
alleged
fact
the
provision
of
heroin
by
an
informant.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
has
been
the
rule
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
was
the
rule
in
the
fifth
circuit.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
also
may
now
be
the
rule
in
the
third
circuit.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
is
clearly
not
the
rule
in
the
seventh
circuit
or
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
is
not
in
the
seventh
either
where
the
mcgrath
decision
applied
russell
and
the
context
in
a
similar
context
to
preclude
an
absolute
defense.
but
we
feel
that
an
informant’s
offer
to
supply
heroin
to
an
individual
simply
not
the
kind
of
offer,
not
the
kind
of
law
enforcement
activity
but
is
likely
to
induce
an
otherwise
innocent
law
abiding
individual
to
enter
the
narcotics
trade.
it
is
simply
not
the
kind
of
objective
law
enforcement
conduct
that
is
likely
to
turn
an
innocent
individual
into
the
path
of
crime.
this
kind
of
offer,
this
kind
of
law
enforcement
conduct,
may
prove
useful
on
apprehending
criminals.
but
it
poses
little
or
no
risk
by
itself
of
trapping
unwary
innocence.
we
therefore
think
that
under
either
view
of
the
proper
scope
of
the
entrapment
test,
petitioner
was
not
entrapped.
but
indeed
the
petitioner
seems
to
concede
as
much
in
this
case
because
he
has
repeatedly
characterized
this
is
not
an
entrapment
case.
but
this
concession,
this
acknowledgment
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
entrapment
creates
for
petitioner
what
appears
to
be
an
insoluble
paradox.
the
due
process
test
that
he
advocates
is
analogous
to
the
test
advocated
by
the
minority
in
russell
and
that
each
of
those
tests
focuses
on
the
conduct
of
the
government
agents,
but
whereas
the
minorities
test
in
russell
entailed
an
evaluation
of
the
governmental
conduct
in
its
entirety.
the
test
proposed
by
petitioner
focuses
exclusively
on
a
single
aspect
of
that
conduct,
the
furnishing
of
narcotics.
his
contention
is
that
an
informant’s
supply
of
narcotics
to
a
suspect
for
controlled
resale
to
government
agents
is
somehow
shocking
an
offensive
per
se.
but,
as
i
have
just
indicated,
that
kind
of
law
enforcement
conducts
standing
alone
carries
so
little
risk
of
inveigling
an
innocent
law-abiding
individual
into
crime,
that
it
does
not
even
constitute
entrapment.
almost
by
definition
therefore,
the
governmental
furnishing
of
narcotics
is
not
shocking
and
offensive
in
any
sense
that
pertains
to
the
essential
concerns
underlying
the
entrapment
doctrine.
it
is
not
shocking
and
offensive
that
it
is
in
any
sense
that
pertains
to
the
values
underlying
the
traditional
defense
of
entrapment.
the
paradox
is
that
those
are
exactly
the
values
and
concerns
adduce
by
petitioner
here.
those
are
the
only
concerns
he
raises.
the
only
kind
of
complaint
that
he
makes
about
the
governmental
conduct
here
is
that
it
is
the
kind
of
conduct
--
and
quote
here
from
this
court
sherman
decision
--
“the
place
on
the
weaknesses
of
an
innocent
party,
beguiles
him
into
committing
crimes
which
he
otherwise
would
not
have
committed.”
this
is
not
a
kind
of
case
like
rochin
against
california
where
other
kinds
of
due
process
values
are
involved.
in
that
case,
the
value
was
the
protection
of
the
citizenry
against
governmental
brutality.
nothing
of
that
kind
is
involved
here.
petitioners
only
claim
is
that
he
was
unfairly
assisted
in
his
own
criminal
activities.
that
is
a
claim
that
smacks
solely
and
simply
of
entrapment
addressed
in
this
case
in
due
process
clothing
simply
to
conceal
petitioner’s
own
criminal
predisposition.
now
these
considerations
suggest
to
us
that
an
allegation
of
governmental
furnishing
of
narcotics
is
merely
one
factor
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
standard
defense
of
entrapment.
such
an
allegation
should
not
be
treated
as
giving
rise
to
a
separate
and
preclusive
due
process
defense.
now
we
would
of
course
concede
that
in
some
hypothetical
circumstances,
the
governmental
furnishing
of
narcotics
could
be
part
of
a
course
of
law
enforcement
conduct
that,
considered
in
its
entirety,
might
entail
the
entrapment
of
an
innocent
individual.
but
our
point
here
is
that
an
allegation
of
such
governmental
furnishing
by
itself
in
essence
raises
only
a
partial
claim
of
entrapment.
and
it
is
such
a
claim
must
be
rejected
if
the
other
requisites
of
an
entrapment
defense
are
lacking,
and
those
requisites
are
lacking
here
and
we
think
that
disposes
the
petitioner’s
case.
with
this
much
said
however,
i
would
now
turn
to
a
closer
analysis
of
petitioner’s
specific
contention
that
somehow
the
governmental
provision
of
narcotics
to
a
suspect
for
controlled
resale
is
shocking
to
the
universal
sense
of
justice,
shocking
to
the
conscience
of
the
court.
of
necessity,
the
application
of
a
due
process
test,
such
as
this,
depends
on
large
measure
upon
the
individual
subjective
judgments
of
the
members
of
the
court.
but
we
believe
that,
to
the
extent
that
analysis
and
experience
may
be
brought
to
bear
in
making
these
judgments,
that
the
governmental
conduct
alleged
here
cannot
be
viewed
as
so
outrageous
--
and
i
quote
here
from
the
majority
opinion
in
russell
--
“cannot
be
viewed
as
so
outrageous
that
due
process
principles
would
absolutely
bar
the
government
from
invoking
judicial
processes
to
obtain
a
conviction.”
our
submission
on
this
point
is
two-fold.
first,
as
an
analytical
matter
we
see
no
constitutionally
significant
difference
between
the
providing
of
narcotics
alleged
by
petitioner
here
and
the
furnishing
of
other
indispensable
means
of
committing
crime,
such
as
the
phenol
2-propanone
that
was
supplied
to
the
defendants
in
united
states
against
russell.
second,
as
a
matter
of
law
enforcement
experience,
we
are
concerned
that
the
adoption
of
a
per
se
due
process
rule
of
the
kind
advocated
by
petitioner,
could
seriously
hamper
enforcement
of
the
narcotics
laws,
and
i
will
discuss
these
two
pointes
in
turn.
first,
as
an
analytical
matter,
the
only
distinction
between
the
heroin
allegedly
supplied
the
petitioner
here
and
the
phenol
2-propanone
supplied
in
russell
is
that
heroin
is
contraband
whereas
phenol
2-propanone
is
not.
that
is
the
only
distinction
we
see
and
that
is
the
only
distinction
that
the
petitioner
has
suggested.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
the
distinction
that
criminal
law
makes
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
our
submission
here
however,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
it
is
a
distinction
which
in
this
context
has
no
constitutional
force.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
once
again,
the
distinction
between
contraband
and
an
alarm
clock
or
the
distinction
from
contraband
and
phenol
2-propenone
is
that
one
is
illegal
and
the
other
legal.
but
regrettably,
regrettably
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
two
as
to
the
relative
obtainability
of
the
two
substances.
that
seems
to
us
is
the
crux
of
petitioner’s
submission.
he
claims
that
one
substance
is
obtainable
and
the
other
is
not,
but
that
is
simply
not
the
as
phenol
2-propenone
was
difficult
to
obtain,
but
it
was
obtainable
and
the
same
may
be
a
set
of
heroin.
indeed,
it
is
very
likely
true
that
heroin
is
more
readily
obtainable,
more
easily
obtained
by
persons
familiar
with
our
narcotics
trade,
such
as
petitioner,
than
is
phenol
2-propenone.
petitioner
by
his
own
admission
in
this
case
was
testified
that
he
had
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
heroin
in
the
past.
he
was
an
acknowledged
heroin
addict
and
he
had
had
contact
with
heroin
with
the
four
months
preceding
his
trial.
we
quote
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
petitioner’s
admission
that
“the
heroin
i
have
seen
since
i
have
been
back
since
i
have
been
out
of
the
penitentiary
has
been
brown.
before
that
it
was
usually
white,
white
powdery
flower-like
substance.”
so
that
heroin
was
obtainable
by
him,
he
had
familiarity
with
it.
since
the
distinction
between
the
heroin
here
and
lawful
substances
that
may
also
be
indispensable
elements
and
crime
does
not
bear
upon
obtainability.
we
think
it
has
no
constitutional
force
here.
heroin
was
otherwise
obtainable
by
petitioner
and
he,
by
his
own
admission,
was
predisposed
to
commit
heroin
offenses.
he
was
willing
to
commit
such
offenses
and
he
was
able
to
do
so.
the
governmental
conduct
alleged
here,
was
therefore
nothing
more
than
the
simple
provision
of
the
opportunities
and
facilities
for
the
commission
of
a
particular
crime
of
a
type
with
which
the
petitioner
was
willing
and
able
to
commit,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
governmental
law
enforcement
conduct
that
has
long
been
sanctioned
by
this
court.
as
to
the
law
enforcement
experience
and
the
wisdom
that
it
can
provide
in
this
case,
we
do
feel
as
i
have
suggested
earlier
that
adoption
of
a
per
se
rule
might
seriously
hamper
enforcement
of
the
narcotics
laws.
and
this
is
so
for
two
different
kinds
of
reasons.
first,
governmental
furnishing
of
contraband
may
in
some
circumstances
be
necessary
to
effective
law
enforcement.
now
this
obviously
is
not
a
wholly
happy
state
of
affairs
but
neither
is
the
fact
of
substantial
narcotics
trade
in
this
country.
the
fact
that
governmental
furnishing
of
narcotics
sometimes
is
necessary
to
catch
narcotic
criminals
is
a
fact,
and
it
is
one
that
we
think
must
be
squarely
faced.
this
court
in
its
much
recognized
fact
in
russell,
court
observed
that
the
infiltration
of
drug
rings
and
a
limited
participation
in
their
unlawful
activities
is
one
of
the
only
practical
means
of
detecting
narcotics
criminals.
we
think
that
that
consideration
does
play
some
part
here.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
this
is
not
a
common
law
enforcement
practice,
that
it
is
not
common
for
the
government,
qua
government
to
provide
narcotics,
but
we
think
that
when
it
does
occur
it
is
not
shocking
and
offensive
per
se.
secondly,
we
are
perhaps
more
concerned
that
a
due
process
rule
of
the
kind
urged
by
petitioner
would
lead
to
acquittals
in
circumstances
where
the
government’s
conduct,
qua
government
was
completely
innocent.
in
some
cases
for
example,
a
narcotics
carrier
may
become
an
informant
and
may
reveal
to
the
government
the
identity
of
the
individuals
to
whom
he
makes
deliveries.
under
the
rule
adapted
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
under
the
instruction
offered
by
petitioners
here,
the
government
would
be
barred
from
prosecuting
those
individuals
and
that
is
a
result
which
seems
to
us
to
be
manifestly
improper.
the
government
has
done
absolutely
nothing
at
all
offensive
or
in
any
way
unfair
in
circumstance
such
as
that.
we
see
absolutely
no
reason
to
bar
prosecution
of
such
narcotics
criminals.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
what
i
was
suggested
was
that
the
governmental
furnishing
of
narcotics
was
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
an
entrapment
defense,
but
that
no
due
process
rule
bearing
focusing
exclusively
upon
that
fact
should
be
adapted.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we
might
then
get
in
broiled
in
a
discussion
of
the
proper
consequences
of
entrapment
defense;
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
there
might
be
circumstances
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
unsavory.
one
kind
of
situation
in
which
governmental
furnishing
of
contraband
might
well
be
offensive
is,
for
example,
where
the
congress
had
outlawed
the
possession
of
a
particular
kind
of
military
weapon.
and
such
weapons
were
not
in
private
possession.
and
the
government
through
undercover
agents
offered
to
furnish
a
defendant
such
a
weapon.
i
think
that
his
possession
in
such
a
case
may
well
not
be
subject
to
prosecution.
but
i
would
make
one
more
point
which
bears
upon
why
we
think
that
a
rule
like
this
is
inadvisable.
in
many
situations,
the
government
simply
has
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
where
the
defendant
obtained
the
narcotics
or
the
other
contraband
that
he
is
accused
of
selling.
in
such
cases,
the
government
will
have
no
affirmative
evidence
with
which
to
rebut
a
claim
that
the
supplier
was
an
informant.
but
more
than
that,
there
may
well
be
situations
in
which
the
supplier
was
in
fact
an
informant
but
was
acting
without
the
knowledge
or
sanction
of
the
government.
that
is
it
may
well
be
the
case
sometimes
that
an
individual
involved
in
a
drug
trade
will
also
be
doubling
as
an
informant
and
will
sometimes
tip-off
the
government
as
to
the
activities
of
some
of
his
associates.
and
we
feel
that
the
fact
that
the
defendant
obtained
narcotics
from
an
informant
who
was
acting
illegally
without
the
knowledge
or
approval
of
the
government,
plainly
does
not
warrant
a
due
process
defense
that
would
bar
prosecution
and
conviction.
in
short,
we
think
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
entrapment
amply
protect
the
unwary
innocent
in
circumstances
such
as
that.
and
then
no
additional
protection
should
be
afforded
the
unwary
criminal.
the
due
process
rule
advocated
by
petitioner
here
would
do
just
that
it
would
afford
additional
protection
to
the
unwary
criminal.
we
think
that
this
court
should
reject
that
per
se
due
process
rule
and
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
am
not
an
expert
in
the
argot
of
the
trade,
but
as
i
have
been
using
the
terms
here
i
have
been
thinking
of
a
government
agent
as
an
employee
of
the
government
and
an
informant
as
a
person
who
may,
from
time
to
time,
cooperate
with
the
government,
sometimes
for
pay
sometimes
not.
the
distinction
tends
to
break
down
in
a
middle
gray
area,
because
the
informant
here
for
example
did
receive
a
per
diem.
he
was
not
paid
for
specific
information
but
simply
paid
$25.00
a
day,
i
think
it
was,
for
his
activities,
but
he
is
not
an
agent
of
the
government
because
he
was
not
subject
to
the
control
of
the
government.
he
just
provided
information
when
and
if
he
had
it.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
he
could
have
been
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
of
course
we
do
not
–-
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
some
are
full
time
police
officers
and
some
are
not.
the
fact
is
that
that
the
government
does
not
have
complete
control
over
the
activities
of
many
of
its
informants,
whereas
the
government
agents
are
people
who
are
subject
to
the
day
to
day
control
and
that
is
the
distinction
that
i
meant
to
be
implicit
in
my
use
of
those
terms.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
