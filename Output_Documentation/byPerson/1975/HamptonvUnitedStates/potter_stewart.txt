justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
russell
case
was
can
not
be
your
hypothetical
case
of
the
time
bomb
in
the
furnishing
by
the
government
of
the
clock?
justice
potter
stewart
but
none
of
these
things
are
really
important
or
material
to
the
basic
question
in
this
case,
is
it
mr.
jones?
is
it
not
the
question
only
whether
or
not
the
instructions,
set
out
on
page
9
of
petitioner’s
brief,
then
was
required?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
fact
in
dispute
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
originally
spend
a
good
deal
a
few
minutes
talking
about
the
dispute
and
in
fact,
that
has
nothing
to
be
with
the
basic
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that
has
been
the
rule
of
the
circuit,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
just
reading
judge
ronnie’s
(ph)
opinion
for
unanimous
court
in
bueno
case
in
1971.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
some
of
the
state
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
is
totally
not
in
the
eighth,
as
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
is
a
distinction
the
criminal
law
makes
to,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
per
the
criminal
law
it
would
have
not
been
a
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
point
is
that
what
is
criminal
is
selling
the
contraband.
it
is
not
criminal
as
selling
an
alarm
clock?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
could
be
subject
to
control
if
he
was
being
paid
by
the
government.
he
could
have
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
told
to
confine
his
duty
to
supply
contraband
to
people
and
then
turn
them
in
for
the
sale
of
that
contraband.
justice
potter
stewart
we
do
not
have
control
over
his
situation
and
certainly
instructions
could
be
framed
to
exonerate
the
government
from
any
rule
as
propose
by
the
petitioner
in
the
event
that
there
was
not
a
deliberate
conscious
act
on
the
part
of
the
government
or
its
agent.
many
undercover
informants
are
full
time
police
officers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
gets
paid
on
a
piece
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
per
deal?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
