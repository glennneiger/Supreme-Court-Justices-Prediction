we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
74-5822,
hampton
against
the
united
states.
mr.
lang,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lang,
the
theory,
which
you
are
advancing
to
us,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
for
the
purposes
of
your
case,
whether
the
government
had
provided
the
money
to
buy
or
the
contraband
to
sell?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
difference
in
principle?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
not
be
the
next
step
providing
the
marked
money
to
buy,
which
does
much
of
obtent
(ph)
in
the
transaction
in
the
governmentâ€™s
role
as
providing
the
contraband
to
sell?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
supply
the
money,
is
there
not
just
as
realistic
notion
that
he
is
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
drug
traffic
and
that
he
is
going
to
use
the
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
way
that
he
agreed
to
use
it
that
is
to
buy
some
narcotics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
his
testimony
which
held
predisposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
hypothetical,
however,
is
quite
a
long
way
off
in
the
case
that
we
have
here.
your
hypothetical
is
one
where
he
is
compelled
or
coerced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lang,
do
you
have
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
