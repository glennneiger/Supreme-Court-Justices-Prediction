justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
your
hypothetic,
although
the
defendant
would
surely
have
a
defense
of
the
rest
available
to
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
one
reason
why
the
government
might
not
want
to
wait
is
that
if
they
do
not
know
its
source
and
cannot
apprehend
him
in
other
ways,
that
might
be
a
year
or
two
afterward
that
they
were
able
to
convict
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
no
conceivable
tort
theory
that
i
have
ever
heard
of,
would
your
men
in
this
case,
be
freed
on
the
ground
of
superseding
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
in
the
argot
of
the
trade
is
there
an
established
difference
between
an
undercover
agent
for
the
government
and
an
informer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
74-5822
hampton
versus
the
united
states,
there
is
not
a
court
opinion,
i
have
written
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
white
have
joined,
mr.
justice
powell
has
written
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
joined
and
the
by
virtue
of
the
combined
reasoning
in
those
opinions
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
in
this
case
is
affirmed.
in
the
case,
petitioner
was
convicted
of
selling
heroin
to
federal
undercover
agents
in
st.
louis.
the
government's
evidence
shows
that
petitioner
had
told
hutton
that
he
needed
money
and
knew
where
he
could
get
some
heroin.
hutton
who
was
an
informant
for
the
drug
enforcement
administration
told
petitioner
that
he
could
find
a
buyer,
hutton
contacted
the
drug
agents
to
setup
a
heroin
sale
and
the
second
sale
was
arranged
by
the
agents
at
the
conclusion
of
which
petitioner
was
arrested.
at
trial
petitioner
claimed
that
the
substance
which
he
sold
had
been
supplied
by
hutton.
the
petitioner
requested
a
jury
instruction
to
the
effect
that
if
the
narcotics
had
been
supplied
by
the
informant,
petitioner
must
be
acquitted
regardless
of
his
predisposition
to
commit
the
crime.
the
trial
court
refused
this
instruction
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
affirmed
relying
on
our
opinion
in
united
states
against
russell,
decided
two
years
ago.
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
chief
justice
mr.
justice
white
had
joined
my
opinion,
mr.
justice
powell
has
written
a
concurring
opinion
joined
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
mr.
justice
brennan
who
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
has
dissented,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
