justice

i
am
assuming
that
the
government
gives
a
known
pusher,
contraband
heroin,
and
a
known
pusher
showed
it
to
your
man,
would
you
still
have
the
same
effect?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
government
just
leaves
a
package
of
heroin
on
the
doorstep
and
the
pusher
picks
it
up.
will
the
government
then
be
guilty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
government
was
the
manufacturing
crime,
because
i
said
this
was
a
known
pusher?
justice
thurgood
marshall
indeed
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
no
dispute
that
the
informant
did
furnish
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
jones,
you
would
have
no
opposition
to
instruction
that
you
said
contain
considerably
whole
matter
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you
mentioned
some
time
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
it
was
broad
enough
you
would
not
have
any
objection?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
thinking
about
one
in
new
york
where
they
have
the
sullivan
law
for
possession
of
a
weapon
and
a
undercover
police
officer
solely
got
weapon
and
then
arrested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
those
are
some
kinds
of
things
that
would
be
a
little
