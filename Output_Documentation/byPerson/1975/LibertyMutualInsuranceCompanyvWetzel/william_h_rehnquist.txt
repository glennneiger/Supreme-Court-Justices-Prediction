justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
would
not
suggest
that
congress
could
not
go
further
in
prohibiting
employment
practices
than
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
it
so
chose,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
grove,
sometime
during
your
argument,
would
you
comment
on
why
you
think
the
district
court’s
order
was
appealable
to
the
third
circuit?
as
i
read
the
complaint,
the
plaintiffs
sought
injunctive
relief,
they
sought
damages.
the
district
court
gave
them
neither,
but
nonetheless
said
it
was
entering
a
final
judgment
and
the
third
circuit
said
we
have
jurisdiction
under
1291.
now,
certainly
in
a
personal
injury
action,
if
the
plaintiff
sues,
gets
a
judgment
on
liability
and
then
district
court
says
this
is
a
final
judgment,
the
defendant
cannot
appeal
without
certification.
it
strikes
me
this
is
somewhat
the
same.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
do
you
have
with
the
proposition
that
a
judgment
on
liability
only
separated
from
remedy
is
indeed
a
final
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
can
let
them
go
if
congress
has
permitted
them
to
go
i
take
it
and
if
you
cannot
do
it
on
the
personal
injury
action,
why
cannot
you
do
it
under
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know
i
can
certainly
see
your
point.
there
is
a
declaration
of
rights
as
to
the
party,
but
what
about
the
personal
injury
case
where
you
have
split
trial
as
to
liability
and
damages?
could
you
not
say
the
court’s
determination
of
the
first
phase
of
the
trial
on
the
issue
of
liability
is
likewise
the
declaratory
judgment
and
would
that
then
be
appealable
because
that
would
change
a
lot
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
am
not
sure
it
answers
it
at
all.[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
he
did
not
certify?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
had
made
a
54(b)
finding
at
the
clause
of
liability
phase
of
a
person
injury
case,
do
you
think
that
would
have
solved
the
problem
in
a
case
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
got
no
part
of
your
prayer
for
relief.
you
asked
for
an
injunction
you
did
not
get
it.
you
asked
for
damages
and
you
did
not
get
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
not
pray
for
such
other
relief
as
it
might
be
just
and
proper?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
third
of
this
trilogy
is
liberty
mutual
ins.
co.
against
wetzel,
number
74-1245.
in
this
case,
respondents
filed
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
in
which
they
asserted
that
petitioner's
employee
insurance
benefits
and
maternity
leave
regulations
discriminated
against
women
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
respondents
on
the
issue
of
petitioner's
liability
under
that
act,
and
petitioner
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
that
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
of
petitioner's
appeal
and
proceeded
to
affirm
on
the
merits,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
sustaining
the
plaintiff's
claims.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
heard
argument
on
the
merits.
though,
neither
party
has
questioned
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
entertain
the
appeal,
we
are
obligated
to
do
so
on
our
own
motion
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
conclude
that
the
district
court's
order
was
not
appealable
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
petitioner's
appeal
to
hear.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
