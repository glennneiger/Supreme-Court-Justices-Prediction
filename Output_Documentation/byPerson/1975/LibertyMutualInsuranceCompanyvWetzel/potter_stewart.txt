mr.
grove
how
old
is
the
plan,
the
insurance
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
has
it
always
had
the
exclusions
and
exemptions
that
now
have?
justice
potter
stewart
that
always
changes?
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
know
how
they
have
been
--
has
there
been
that
evolution,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
legislative
history
so
to
speak,
any
explanation
in
the
record
anywhere
as
to
these,
i
do
not
mean
now,
post
hoc
explanation
or
rationalization,
but
any
historic
explanation
for
the
exclusions
and
exceptions
of
this
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
waiting
periods
and
things
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
colloquy
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
specter?
justice
potter
stewart
where
in
your
view
in
the
many
briefs
filed
with
us
is
the
evolution
of
the
commission's
attitude
most
clearly
and
pictorially
and
thoroughly
and
intelligibly
set
up?
justice
potter
stewart
106
to
119
in
the
gilbert
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
respondentâ€™s
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
may,
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
do
i
understand
by
which
you
just
told
us
that
the
question
is
here,
whether
--
if
asked
today
whether
congress
would
--
majority
of
congress
might
be
persuaded
to
enact
legislation
that
would
say
that
no
employer
interstate
commerce
could
have
group
insurance
policy
that
excluded
pregnancy
as
among
the
disabilities
covered,
is
that
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
what
you
are
telling
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
until
one
gets
--
one
does
not
get
to
defenses
until
and
unless
there
is
a
finding
of
discrimination
based
upon
sex,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
under
all
the
decisions
of
this
court,
including
aiello?
justice
potter
stewart
where
in
the
citation?
justice
potter
stewart
444?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
which
say
the
policy
actually
had
other
exclusions
in
addition
to
those
that
are
here?
justice
potter
stewart
oh!
it
does,
i
know,
but
you
say
the
one
in
effect
had
even
more
other
exclusions
than
this?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
it
in
the
record?
