mr.
howard
a.
specter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
howard
specter.
i
have
the
privilege
of
representing
the
respondents,
mrs.
wetzel
and
mrs.
ross
in
a
matter
now
before
the
court.
it
was
not
my
intention
to
track
in
any
way
the
arguments
made
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
but
it
may
be
that
i
can
answer
to
some
extent,
or
at
least
one
of
the
questions
posed
by
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
concerning
the
age
of
the
plan
here
in
question
and
whether
any
explanation
for
the
evolution
of
the
plan
and
the
exclusions
was
ever
given
below.
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
are
a
series
of
exhibits
and
they
begin
at
page
90.
they
were
exhibits
to
the
plaintiff’s
brief
for
summary
judgment
below
and
they
were
made
part
of
the
record
by
affidavit.
the
affidavit
which
described
them
begins
at
page
86
and
reveals
that
the
exclusion
with
which
we
are
concerned
was
in
existence
at
least
as
early
as
march
1964.
the
subsequent
exhibits
deal
with
later
changes
in
the
plan,
but
to
the
extent
that
there
were
changes,
those
changes
generally
did
not
relate
to
changes
in
coverage,
but
rather
to
--
mr.
howard
a.
specter
changes
in
premium
primarily
and
things
like
that.
now,
in
addition
to
the
extent
that
mr.
grove
talks
about
the
fact
that
there
are
other
exclusions
in
the
plan
and
as
described,
those
exclusions,
it
is
imperative
to
note
that
many
of
the
exclusions
to
which
he
made
reference
are
nowhere
in
the
record
below.
the
plan
which
he
has
described
is
the
plan
which
is
annexed
as
an
appendix
to
the
petitioner’s
brief.
it
is
a
plan
which
was
never
made
part
of
the
record
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
as
far
as
anyone
in
this
case
knows
was
never
in
existence
until
the
day
that
i
saw
their
brief
for
the
first
time.
with
respect
to
the
contention,
that
the
plan
also
excludes
coverage
for
complications
due
to
pregnancy,
some
clarification
is
in
order.
the
court
of
appeals
did
indeed
state
that
the
plan
excluded
complications
and
of
course
that
was
not
the
case
in
aiello
where
only
normal
pregnancy
was
involved.
i
think
it
is
a
bit
unfair
to
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
to
state
as
to
the
petitioner
in
its
brief
that
it
misconstrued
the
plan
by
assuming
that
there
was
no
coverage
for
complications.
there
is
on
file
with
this
court,
a
transcript
of
the
argument
which
was
held
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
october
of
1973
or
1974,
i
have
forgotten
which
at
this
point,
where
there
was
a
colloquy
between
various
members
of
the
court
and
mr.
grove
who
argued
for
the
petitioner
and
after
repeated
questions
in
which
mr.
grove
acknowledged
that
complications
were
not
covered
and
where
they
discussed
specific
complications
such
as
hypertension,
blood
poisoning
and
others,
the
court
asked,
but
it
is
clearly
understood,
and
this
is
at
page
6
of
the
transcript,
but
it
is
clearly
understood
that
if
we
have
a
normal
pregnancy
or
a
pregnancy
with
complications
neither
are
covered
and
the
response
was
that
is
correct
under
my
client’s
policy
that
is
in
issue
here
today.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes
your
honor.
now
in
enacting
title
vii,
as
part
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
congress
had
several
objectives
and
of
course
there
was
the
objective
of
guaranteeing
equal
employment
opportunity
without
regard
to
sex.
the
guaranteeing
also
in
the
employment
context,
the
preservation
of
the
individual
employee’s
dignity
as
a
person,
as
an
employee
without
regard
to
sex
among
other
criteria
and
the
objective
of
maximizing
the
utilization
of
the
human
resources
of
this
country
by
not
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
sex
or
otherwise.
and
i
do
not
think
it
takes
prolonged
argument
to
demonstrate
the
extent
to
which
this
court
in
recent
opinions
has
recognized
the
evolution
of
women’s
role
in
american
commerce
since
mr.
justice
bradley
wrote
in
bradwell
versus
illinois
that
in
the
divine
nature
of
things,
women
are
unfit
to
engage
in
the
ordinary
occupations
of
civil
life.
this
court
has
long
since
recognized
that
those
days
are
over.
notwithstanding
the
petitioner’s
longstanding
practice
of
segregating
job
classifications
by
sex
as
the
trial
in
appellate
courts
found
that
it
did
in
this
case,
i
expect
that
very
few
people
would
suggest
today
that
men
and
women
are
not
similarly
situated
in
the
employment
context
and
that
women
are
not
able
to
hold
virtually
every
job
that
men
are
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
narrow
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
test
which
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
which
was
not
raised
here.
now,
even
though
they
are
similarly
situated
in
the
employment
context,
of
course
it
is
fundamental
that
men
and
women
are
in
many
ways
different
as
indeed
they
must
be.
and
perhaps,
the
most
fundamental
difference
lies
in
the
fact
that
only
women
can
become
pregnant
and
when
they
do,
to
one
extent
or
another
and
for
one
period
of
time
or
another,
they
become
disabled
and
men
do
not
get
pregnant
and
to
that
extent
they
are
different.
but
so
long
as
employers,
like
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
are
permitted
to
fire
employees,
women
employees
simply
because
they
are
pregnant
without
regard
to
disability
and
so
long
as
they
are
found,
as
long
as
they
are
permitted
to
impose
mandatory,
unpaid
leaves
of
absence
without
regard
to
ability
to
work
just
because
they
are
pregnant
and
so
long
as
practices
like
the
one
involved
here
where
comprehensive
income
protection
benefits
are
provided
for
virtually
every
disability
to
which
a
man
can
be
subjected
and
none
for
the
one
disability
unique
to
the
woman,
then
those
guarantees
that
title
vii
was
intended
to
protect
of
equal
employment
opportunity
and
human
dignity
are
in
fact
unachievable
today.
i
think
mr.
grove
accurately
stated
the
question
as,
did
congress
intend
to
go
that
far?
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
there
are
any
number
of
aids
to
statutory
construction
in
dealing
with
the
precise
issue
here
today.
it
would
require
a
remarkable
lack
of
candor
on
my
part,
however,
if
i
were
to
argue
that
the
specific
legislative
history
dealing
with
the
addition
of
the
word
“sex”
to
title
vii
was
very
enlightening
in
and
of
itself,
it
is
clearly
not.
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
one
year
before
the
enactment
of
title
vii,
the
same
congress,
the
88th
congress
enacted
the
equal
pay
act.
and
there
is
copious
legislative
history
concerning
the
equal
pay
act
and
copious
legislative
history
involving
the
practice
which
is
in
question
here
because
the
opponents
of
the
act
went
to
congress
as
they
are
now
coming
to
this
court
and
took
the
position
that
because
it
costs
a
certain
amount
of
money
to
employ
women
because
they
become
pregnant
and
disabled
and
disability
benefits
sometimes
have
to
be
provided
and
in
fact,
they
were
provided
to
most
women
that
employers
should
be
permitted
to
pay
women
less.
they
should
be
permitted
to
take
into
account
the
fact
of
pregnancy
and
the
cost
of
pregnancy
related
disabilities
in
order
to
pay
them
less.
the
legislative
history
and
in
fact
a
bill
and
an
amendment
were
introduced
which
would
have
provided
just
that
and
they
were
rejected.
there
is
an
extensive
treatment
of
the
legislative
history
and
i
will
not
dwell
on
it,
but
it
can
be
found
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents
in
the
next
case
to
be
argued
at
pages
121
to
138.
now,
certain
things
happened
after
the
enactment
of
title
vii
in
congress
too.
we
became
involved
with
the
equal
rights
amendment
upon
which
many
of
the
petitioner's
amici
and
this
petitioner
rely,
they
rely
upon
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
and
they
assert
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
equal
rights
amendment
supports
the
contention
that
the
practice
involved
here
should
survive
a
title
vii
attack.
i
would
only
point
out
that
there
was
a
law
review
article
prepared
by
a
number
of
scholars
entitled
a
constitutional
basis
for
equal
rights
for
women,
it
was
published
at
80,
yale
law
journal
871
and
it
was
submitted
to
every
member
of
congress
in
connection
with
the
consideration
of
equal
rights
amendment
and
it
was
deemed
by
congress
to
be
primarily
legislative
history
in
connection
with
that
amendment.
and
the
authors
of
that
article
in
response
to
general
electric’s
brief
have
submitted
an
amicus
curiae
brief
to
this
court
in
the
general
electric
case
in
which
they
track
the
legislative
history
of
the
equal
rights
amendment
and
point
out
the
way
in
which
it
has
been
portrayed
to
this
court
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
challenged
practice
here
today
would
not
survive.
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
whose
guidelines
were
sustained
or
upheld
by
the
court
below
did
not
adapt
a
new
position
overnight
in
1972.
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
various
amici
in
support
of
our
position,
as
early
as
1970,
before
congress
had
an
opportunity
to
amend
the
act
in
1972,
the
eeoc
had
developed,
not
the
guidelines,
but
the
principle,
the
premise
which
has
evolved
into
the
guidelines
and
had
published
various
decisions
which
made
it
clear
that
from
the
eeoc’s
point
of
view,
disparate
treatment
based
upon
the
fact
of
pregnancy
was
condemned
by
the
act.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes
your
honor.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
again,
i
think
credit
is
to
be
given
to
the
counsel
for
the
respondents
in
gilbert.
at
pages
106
through
119
--
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes,
that
is
the
fact,
the
yellow
one,
your
honor.
now,
even
after
that
and
perhaps
most
significantly
because
the
petitioner
has
not
responded
to
it,
the
educational
amendments
act
of
1972
and
1974
were
enacted
and
provided
for
prohibitions
against
sex
discrimination
in
federally
funded
educational
projects
and
delegated
to
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
the
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
to
carry
out
those
amendments.
and
congress
provided
that
unlike
the
eeoc’s
guidelines,
hew
would
have
to
publish
the
regulations
in
advance
of
an
effective
date
and
submit
them
to
congress
and
that
if
congress
did
not
reject
them
or
alter
them
within
45
days,
they
would
be
self-executing.
they
were
published,
they
were
transmitted
and
they
became
effective
and
they
are
virtually
identical
to
the
guidelines
involved
here
today
and
they
certainly
would
indicate
the
current
view
of
congress
and
i
think
under
the
philosophy
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
burnet
versus
guggenheim
demonstrate
what
it
is
that
congress
would
have
done
back
in
1964
when
considering
the
issue.
i
think
that
is
the
choice
which
has
to
be
made.
i
would
like
to
endeavor
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
respond
to
your
question
--
mr.
howard
a.
specter
i
am
sorry,
it
is
apparent
that
i
did
not
articulate
as
clearly
as
i
should
have,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
the
area
of
statutory
construction,
it
is
appropriate
to
look
if
there
is
any
question
to
statutes
and
legislative
history
which
were
enacted
or
were
involved
prior
to
and
subsequent
to
the
particular
statute
involved
to
determine
some
continuing
philosophy
which
would
indicate
what
it
was
that
congress
had
in
mind
back
when
it
enacted
the
particular
statute.
and
what
we
have
here
i
believe
is
a
steady
pattern
which
is
reflective
of
an
intention
in
1964
to
prohibit
this
prior
treatment
based
on
pregnancy
as
a
characteristic
unique
to
females.
i
do
not
think
the
question
is
what
would
they
do
if
presented
with
the
question
today?
i
hope
that
answers
your
honor's
your
question.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
you
raised
the
question
of
appealability
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
it
adequately,
but
i
hope
that
i
can.
we
considered
that
question
when
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
course
what
we
did
has
no
authority,
but
i
assure
we
would
have
gone
kicking
and
screaming
to
the
court
of
appeals
just
as
we
opposed
coming
here
after
winning
the
case,
but
in
my
view,
a
declaratory
judgment
was
entered
which
could
be
considered
to
be
final
as
--
mr.
howard
a.
specter
well,
the
most
candid
answer
i
can
give
the
court
is
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
appealable
and
i
believe
it
is
different.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
we
are
dealing
with
a
uniform
practice
applied
to
a
class
of
persons
which
under
this
court’s
decision
in
sosna
versus
iowa
has
a
kind
of
jural
existence
of
its
own,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
totally
answers
the
question.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
as
i
said,
i
would
do
the
best
that
i
can.
you
raised
an
issue
that
i
do
not
think
anyone
fully
anticipated.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
it
certainly
did,
it
certainly
did
mr.
justice
white
and
i
would
analogize
it
if
it
is
appropriate
to
do
so
to
what
happened
in
gilbert,
the
next
case
to
be
argued
where
an
injunction
was
issued.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes,
your
honor
i
think
it
is
that
and
something
else.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
well,
he
was
asked
to
certify
it
and
he
was
asked
by
the
petitioner
to
certify
it
under
1292(b)
and
i
believe
this
is
in
the
record
because
there
was
colloquy
on
the
record,
i
believe
the
court
concluded
that
rather
than
have
to
await
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
54(b)
would
be
more
appropriate
and
expeditious
way
of
resolving
a
very
important
question.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
not
under
1292(b)
mr.
howard
a.
specter
and
i
hope
it
was
right.[laughter]
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes,
i
do.
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
more
comment
if
i
may,
concerning
the
appealability
because
i
believe
it
is
analogous
to
the
gilbert
situation
where
an
injunction
was
entered
and
then
stayed.
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge,
judge
webber
said
that
this
was
an
appropriate
case
for
injunctive
relief,
but
he
would
withhold
the
entry
of
the
injunction,
pending
disposition
of
the
appeal
and
i
think
that
functionally,
we
have
the
same
situation
and
it
may
be
a
question
of
form
over
substance
although
i
am
reluctant
to
make
an
argument
like
that
with
respect
to
a
jurisdictional
question
if
indeed
it
is
jurisdictional.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
oh,
expressly
yes
your
honor,
that
is
in
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
i
like
to
say
no.
i
am
not
sure,
but
i
expect
that
the
answer
is
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
and
that
certainly
is
the
situation
here
where
there
were
three
separate
claims
brought
on
behalf
of
the
class.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
well,
hopefully
this
one
and
two
--
mr.
howard
a.
specter
the
damage
issue
has
not
been
resolved.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
the
damage
issue
was
before
the
trial
court
in
one
of
the
other
claims,
the
claim
of
discrimination
and
hiring
and
promotion,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
the
claim
that
the
pregnancy
related
practices
are
violative
of
title
vii
and
the
claim
which
is
not
before
this
court
that
the
petitioner
discriminated
against
women
as
a
class
in
hiring
and
promotion
even
though
the
issue
of
back-pay
has
not
been
resolved.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
a.
specter
back-pay,
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
that
is
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
also
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
however.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
yes,
we
did
and
that
is
on
page
19
of
the
appendix,
a
very
troublesome
aiello
case.
a
number
of
things
can
be
said
about
aiello
which
distinguished
it
from
this
case
aside
from
the
obvious
fact
that
it
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
case,
dealing
with
the
state’s
social
welfare
policy
and
not
a
title
vii
case,
involving
a
relationship
between
an
employer
and
an
employee
under
a
statute.
one
is
that
unlike
the
situation
here,
california
so
fit
to
come
into
court
and
explain
why
the
plan
contained
the
exclusions
that
it
did.
and
in
fact,
when
an
effort
was
made
to
ascertain
why
the
petitioner
in
this
case
excluded
the
benefits
that
we
are
talking
about
today,
the
only
explanation
ever
proffered
was
on
advice
of
counsel
and
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
it
is
not
required.
there
was
never
any
justification
given
in
terms
of,
well,
it
was
done
because
it
will
cost
as
this
much
or
it
was
done
because
we
are
concerned
about
the
welfare
of
certain
of
our
employees
or
it
was
done
because
we
do
not
have
enough
money
to
do
it
or
for
any
other
explanation.
the
position
was
about
this
case
on
the
facts,
on
the
language
of
the
plan
was
right
for
summary
judgment
and
no
explanation
for
the
reason
behind
the
plan
is
required.
now,
i
think
you
get
into
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
to
some
extent
when
you
reach
that
point
because
in
the
previous
opinions
of
this
court,
in
title
vii
situations,
relatively
light
burdens
have
been
imposed
upon
employees
for
making
a
prima
facie
tests
and
the
test
has
been
declared,
in
other
cases
to
be
one
of
basic
fairness
and
it
has
been
stated
that
of
course
the
standard
varies
from
case
to
case,
but
i
would
point
only
that
in
this
situation,
no
one
but
the
employer
knows
why
it
did
what
it
did
and
why
it
excluded
whatever
it
excluded.
and
once
it
was
demonstrated
under
the
standards
annunciated
by
this
court
that
only
women
were
affected
by
this
program,
the
burden
in
fairness
then
shifted
to
the
employer
to
come
forward
with
whatever
simple
or
complex
explanation
it
might
have
had
for
the
plan.
and
with
respect
to
any
other
defenses
which
have
been
suggested
in
the
briefs
or
today
at
oral
argument,
i
would
only
comment
very
briefly
that
there
were
absolutely
no
defenses
suggested,
raised,
briefed
or
argued
below
and
it
is
fundamental
that
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
to
assert
them.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
of
course,
your
honor
and
it
was
a
position
of
the
petitioner
below
that
there
was
none
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
and
under
all
of
the
tests
enunciated
by
this
court,
the
question
is
basically
one
of
impact
and
where
does
the
impact
fall
and
if
it
falls
on
a
protected
class
that
is
--
mr.
howard
a.
specter
title
vii
cases
your
honor,
title
vii
cases.
i
am
not
sure
quite
sincerely
what
the
burden
of
proof
was
in
aiello.
even
assuming,
well,
not
assuming,
it
is
apparent
that
aiello
required
the
showing
of
pretext
at
least
within
the
context
of
that
case
and
i
am
not
sure
where
the
burden
of
proof
would
fall
to
demonstrate
the
presence
or
lack
of
a
pretext
in
the
first
instance.
the
burdens
generally
imposed
by
this
court
in
the
title
vii
cases
have
been
like
ones
and
in
many
of
those
cases
where
the
burdens
of
proof
were
enunciated,
ultimately
the
employees
did
not
prevail,
but
i
think
there
has
been
a
clear
recognition
that
in
fairness,
once
an
impact
is
shown,
the
party
who
is
in
possession
of
the
knowledge
concerning
the
practice
ought
to
come
forward
and
explain
it
and
perhaps
coincident
with
that,
the
test
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
stevens
in
his
dissenting
the
opinion
in
spurgess
(ph)
is
an
appropriate
one
because
i
think
it
dovetails
with
the
impact
test
enunciated
by
this
court
in
title
vii
cases

the
employee
--
mr.

a.
specter
taking
the
most
recent
plan,
the
one
which
we
know
was
in
effect
in
june
of
1970,
if
we
look
at
page
99
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
is
the
statement;
limitations
on
insurance
benefits.
benefits
are
not
payable
for
disability
due
to
pregnancy
or
any
cause
related
to
pregnancy
and
that
is
what
we
say
is
wrong
mr.
justice
marshall
because
the
impact
falls
solely
upon
women.
mr.
howard
a.
specter
that
is
the
one
which
the
record
demonstrates
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
adjudication
and
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
the
only
plan.
that
exclusion
is
also
included
in
the
plan
which
was
annexed
as
an
appendix
to
the
petitioner’s
brief,
but
it
is
no
part
of
the
record
and
i
cannot
fairly
address
myself
to
its
existence
or
when
it
came
into
being.
i
believe
that
my
time
is
up
and
unless
your
honor
has
another
question,
thank
you
very
much.
