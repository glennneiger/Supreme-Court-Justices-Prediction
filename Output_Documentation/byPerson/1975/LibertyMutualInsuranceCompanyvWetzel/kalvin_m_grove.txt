mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
you
today
on
review
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
which
reviewing
liberty
mutual
insurance
company’s
disability
program
for
its
employees,
determined
that
that
plan
violates
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
know
just
exactly
what
their
plan
is
and
what
it
provides.
first
of
all,
besides
excluding
from
coverage,
disability
due
to
pregnancy
and
complications
from
pregnancy,
that
plan
has
numerous
other
exclusions.
it
does
not
cover
disabilities
due
to
self-inflicted
wounds.
it
does
not
cover
disabilities
unless
the
employee
is
under
the
care
of
a
licensed
physician.
it
does
not
cover
acts
of
suicide.
it
does
not
cover
acts
which
are
the
cause
of
declared
or
undeclared
war
and
it
does
not
cover
emotional
disorders,
alcoholism,
or
narcotics
or
drug
addiction
unless
again
the
employee
is
under
the
care
of
a
licensed
physician.
the
plan
provides
that
contributions
are
made
by
the
employees
no
matter
what
their
sex
in
equal
amounts
and
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
in
turn
contributes
to
the
plan
equally
no
matter
what
the
person’s
sex
is.
the
third
circuit
held
that
this
court’s
decision
in
geduldig
versus
aiello
was
not
applicable
because
of
the
fact
that
that
case
arose
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
this
case
arises
under
title
vii.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
court’s
reasoning
in
aiello
is
directly
in
line
with
title
vii
and
there
is
no
reason
why
that
thinking
should
not
be
applied
to
a
title
vii
case.
the
question
is,
is
it
discrimination
and
no
matter
what
the
standard
is
that
is
the
question
that
has
to
be
determined.
in
this
court,
in
a
similar
situation,
in
fact
the
california
disability
plan
is
very
similar
to
the
liberty
plan,
held
that
absent
a
showing,
that
the
exclusion
of
a
risk
was
pretext
to
engage
in
an
invidious
discrimination,
you
could
do
such
and
liberty
mutual
here
because
of
valid
and
cogent
region
has
decided
to
exclude
certain
disabilities
under
its
plan
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
under
your
thinking
that
is
not
discrimination
based
on
sex.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
you
could
not
apply
aiello
because
of
the
fact,
again,
as
i
repeated
that
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
and
title
vii
cannot
apply,
suggests
that
that
is
improper
and
should
not
be
the
holding.
this
court
specifically
in
response
to
i
believe
mr.
justice
brennan’s
dissent
and
mr.
justice
marshall’s
dissent
in
a
footnote
indicated
that
the
policy
was
lawful.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
is
going
to
review
aiello,
then
aiello
should
be
affirmed
and
the
court
should
say
that
that
case
is
applicable
to
title
vii.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
i
agree
with
that
statement.
if
congress
so
chose,
but
we
submit
the
congress
did
not
so
choose.
if
aiello
was
not
applied,
you
are
going
to
have
a
result
of
at
least
in
those
states
where
the
state
is
the
carrier
such
as
california
and
other
states,
the
insurance
carrier,
where
the
state
under
the
umbrella
of
aiello
will
not
need
to
provide
this
benefit,
but
the
state
as
an
employer
will
have
to
provide
the
benefit
to
its
employees.
you
are
going
to
have
one
standard
for
the
state
as
the
insurance
carrier
and
another
standard
for
the
state
as
an
employer
and
to
me,
that
result
is
not
what
title
vii
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
supposed
to
accomplish.
i
think
that
we
as
practitioners
in
this
area
are
looking
for
some
guidance
from
the
court
because
there
are
as
you
know
by
the
numerous
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
the
parties
are
squarely
on
one
side
or
the
other.
everyone
is
citing
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that
you
did
not
mean
what
you
said,
and
therefore,
you
need
to
come
up
with
a
new
standard
and
the
other
side,
the
liberty
side
if
you
will,
says
that
what
you
meant
is
exactly
applicable
to
title
vii
and
i
do
not
think
that
we
should
have
different
standards
for
the
determination
of
what
is
discrimination.
the
court
of
appeals,
after
summarily
dismissing
aiello
with
a
one
very
quick
brief
sentence,
then
went
on
and
said
that
because
of
three
things;
number
one
that
because
the
eeoc
has
come
down
with
guidelines
which
indicate
this
policy
is
violated
and
since
they
have
some
expertise
in
the
area,
the
court
should
defer
to
them.
i
suggest
in
this
situation
that
the
eeoc
guidelines
as
in
the
espinosa
(ph)
should
not
be
given
deference
to.
as
the
court
is
well
aware
and
it
is
stated
in
the
briefs,
from
1965
when
title
vii
became
applicable
until
after
this
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
commission
was
on
record
as
stating
that
a
policy
such
as
liberty
mutuals
was
not
in
violation
of
title
vii.
and
as
in
any
hearings,
requests
from
experts
if
you
will,
requests
for
interested
employer’s
associations
or
anyone
else,
the
eeoc
all
of
the
sudden
came
down
and
changed
its
position.
but
yet
in
the
aiello
case
before
you
the
eeoc’s
amicus
brief
clearly
indicated
that
what
you
were
going
to
hold
in
aiello
could
be
dispositive
of
title
vii
cases.
of
course
now,
the
eeoc
comes
down
with
their
guideline
and
so
it
is
just
exactly
opposite
and
i
suggest
that
they
should
not
be
entitled
to
the
deference
normally
granted
to
an
agency
because
you
have
a
shifting
stand
situation
here
and
they
are
no
more
expert
in
this
situation
than
i
submit
this
court.
the
third
circuit
then
went
on
to
say
that
because
liberty
mutual
has
so
many
coverages
under
its
policy
that
it
is
unreasonable
for
it
to
exclude
pregnancy
and
disabilities
due
to
pregnancy.
therefore,
they
cannot
sustain
that
exclusion
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
i
think
the
third
circuit
read
the
plan
wrong
because
as
i
have
just
read
to
you,
the
plan
does
have
numerous
situations
where
disabilities
are
excluded.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
i
do
not
know
exactly
your
honor.
i
would
say
at
least
it
is
prior
to
1972.
prior
to
the
guidelines
as
it
would
--
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
yes,
it
is.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
no,
there
have
not
been
any
changes
as
far
as
i
know.
if
there
were
changes
and
i
submit
i
do
not
know,
they
were
to
include
more
as
opposed
to
taking
out
some,
that
is
more
disabilities
would
be
included
as
being
excluded
from
the
plan’s
coverage.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
i
cannot
respond.
i
really
do
not
know.
i
think
there
have
been,
but
i
am
unfamiliar
with
it.
over
the
years
that
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
has
been
in
business,
i
cannot
tell
you
how
many
years
and
i
am
sure
that
over
the
years
there
have
been
some
changes,
but
i
am
frankly
unfamiliar
with
all
the
changes.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
no,
there
was
none.
it
was
just,
this
plan
that
was
litigated
and
there
was
no
attempt
by
either
side,
if
you
will,
to
go
back
into
history
to
determine
those
questions.
lastly,
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
the
proper
standard
to
determine
this
case,
again
was
not
aiello
but
griggs
versus
duke
power.
we
submit
that
under
griggs
versus
duke
power,
you
do
not
have
a
violation
in
this
type
of
situation.
we
must
remember
that
all
women
and
all
men
at
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
under
this
plan
received
exactly
the
same
contribution
from
the
company.
they
make
the
same
contribution
and
the
benefits
to
all
are
exactly
the
same.
for
every
disability
to
the
man
may
have,
a
woman
has
the
same
coverage
under
the
plan
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
there
are
rational
basis
for
liberty
mutual's
plan,
the
record
so
indicates.
first
of
all,
as
long
as
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
plan
was
instituted
or
the
exclusion
was
instituted
as
a
pretext
to
engage
invidious
discrimination
then
an
employer
is
free
to
exclude
whatever
he
wants
from
the
disability
plan.
i
submit
to
you
that
this
record
does
not
sustain
a
showing
that
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
engaged
in
a
pretext
of
excluded
maternity,
a
pretext
to
engage
in
invidious
discrimination.
the
plan
is
such
so
that
the
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
can
pay
to
its
employees
the
maximum
of
benefits.
the
company
has
determined,
based
upon
statistics
that
it
had
that
if
it
was
to
cover
the
disability
of
maternity
and
complications
due
to
maternity
that
that
would
be
the
greatest
number
of
claims.
it
would
be
the
greatest
drain
on
the
plan,
and
therefore,
it
felt
that
it
would
either
have
to
revise
its
plan,
it
would
have
to
contribute
more,
require
the
employees
to
contribute
more,
and
therefore,
it
did
not
desire
to
do
such.
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
discussed
in
aiello,
said
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
state
of
california
was
desirous
of
maintaining
the
integrity
and
sanctity
of
its
plan.
the
state
felt
in
its
wisdom
that
if
it
covered
the
disability
in
aiello
what
was
normal
pregnancy,
it
could
distort
the
plan
and
said
that
that
was
perfectly
legitimate.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well,
i
think
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
instance
your
honor
is
it
split
the
issue
of
liability
and
remedy
and
determined
liability
and
then
said
that
there
is
no
reason
to
delay
an
appeal
on
this
situation
under
the
rules
which
she
had
the
right
to
do
and
then
submitted
it
to
the
third
circuit
which
took
it
under
that
situation.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well,
i
cannot
give
you
any
authority
right
now,
but
in
my
knowledge
this
is
very
common
situation
that
occurs
in
the
trial
courts.
many
of
the
cases,
in
fact
title
vii
is
the
exact
situation
where
it
is
being
practiced
heavily
where
the
judges
are
splitting
the
issue
of
liability
and
damages.
only
hearing
the
matter
of
liability
because
determining
damages
in
these
cases
as
you
know
is
extremely
complicated
and
the
courts
are
issuing
determinations
on
liability,
letting
those
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
coming
back.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
i
do
not
have
any
answer,
a
good
answer
your
honor.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
happened
that
judge
indicated
that
there
was
no
reason
to
delay
an
appeal
in
this
situation
and
it
happened.
i
do
not
think,
again
to
repeat
myself,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
this
court
needs
to
tamper
with
its
prior
ruling
in
geduldig
versus
aiello
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
this
court
needs
to
say
that
there
is
a
different
standard
for
title
vii
cases
than
there
are
for
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
the
second
is
the
way
i
read
the
guidelines.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
that
is
right.
that
there
is
an
absence
in
this
record
that
shows
that
liberty
mutual
excluded
the
disability
that
we
are
talking
about
as
a
pretext
to
engage
invidious
--
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well,
i
suggest
it
is,
except
for
the
fact
that
all
employers
during
the
first
seven
years
of
title
vii
relied
upon
that
and
then
all
of
the
sudden
lawsuits
like
this
came
along
where
the
commission
then
switched
their
position
and
came
along
with
plaintiffs
as
in
this
case
to
try
to
substantiate
their
guidelines.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
your
honor
what
is
on
page
99
appears
to
be
only
a
portion
of
the
plan,
the
limitations.
what
is
in
the
record
or
in
our
brief
before
you
includes
other
exclusions
that
do
not
appear
at
page
99
of
the
record.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
no,
the
other
disabilities
that
i
talked
about.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
as
far
as
it
goes
it
is
accurate,
the
one
that
you
are
referring
to
on
page
99.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well,
the
one
right
before
you.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
that
is
right.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well
it
is
--
i
am
not
sure
it
is
in
the
record.
bear
in
mind
the
material
that
is
presented
here,
i
find
it
somewhat
of
a
shock
that
mr.
specter
now
says
that
he
has
never
seen
the
plan
because
the
discovery
in
this
case
has
been
extensive,
but
the
plan
that
is
attached
to
our
brief
is
the
actual
plan
and
it
does
have
exclusions
over
and
above
that
which
appears
on
page
99.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
in
my
recollection
that
it
is,
but
--
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
it
should
be.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well,
yes
it
is.
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court’s
attention
to
comments
concerning
the
equal
pay
act
that
mr.
specter
made;
the
wage
and
hour
administrator
has
said,
“if
the
employer
contributions
to
a
plan
providing
insurance
for
a
similar
benefits
to
employees
are
equal,
for
both
men
and
women,
no
wage
differential
prohibited
by
the
equal
pay
provisions
will
result
from
such
payments,
even
though
the
benefits
which
accrued
to
the
employees
in
question
are
greater
for
one
sex
than
for
the
other.”
so
according
to
the
administrator
of
equal
pay
act,
liberty
mutual's
policy
of
making
equal
contributions
is
in
total
and
full
compliance
with
the
equal
pay
act.
i
think
that
also
when
mr.
specter
indicates
that
we
gave
no
reason
why
we
have
excluded
these
disabilities,
i
think
the
court
and
it
said
it
in
aiello
is
that
it
is
evident
that
a
program
or
a
totally
comprehensive
program
is
going
to
cost
substantially
more
than
one
without
these
disabilities
and
i
think
that
cost
situation
can
be
assumed.
i
submit
though
and
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question,
the
burden
always
remains
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
the
reason
for
the
exclusion
is
a
pretext
and
they
have
not
done
that
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
reason
for
the
exclusion
was
--
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well,
aiello
says
to
us
that
exclusion
of
this
disability
is
not
discrimination
per
se
until
it
is
shown
that
the
reason
for
the
exclusion
is
a
pretext
to
engage
in
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well,
i
do
not
think
you
get
to
the
question
of
cost
unless
the
plaintiff
has
sustained
its
initial
burden.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
in
aiello
says
it
is
not.
if
i
would,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
yes,
well
i
agree
with
your
dissent.[laughter]
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
absolutely
not.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
or
even
the
test
that
you
applied;
if
your
test,
your
dissent
in
spurgess
was
applied
you
would
not
because
you
do
not
have
discrimination
between
substantially
similarly
situated
people.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
would
not
these
plaintiffs?
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
i
have
some
difficulty
in
understanding
just
exactly
what
you
are
saying
even
though
you
are
saying
it
per
the
point.[laughter]
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
okay.
what
is
important
though
is
the
plan;
mr.
specter
argues
about
the
impact,
but
this
plan
if
you
look
at
it
has
impact
in
disproportion
in
statistics
against
others.
statistically,
i
presume
that
one
might
be
able
to
show
that
males
attempt
suicide
in
a
greater
rate
than
women.
so
because
we
exclude
that,
i
supposed
we
are
discriminating
against
males.
one
might
legitimately
argue
i
suppose
that
statistically
men
have
alcoholic
problems
greater
than
women.
i
do
not
know
if
you
can
prove
that,
but
just
assume,
so
we
do
not
cover
that
unless
there
is
a
licensed
physician
so
we
probably
are
excluding
or
discriminating
against
men
in
that
situation.
i
think
the
whole
thing
goes
to
say
and
really
in
summary,
that
an
employer
such
as
liberty
mutual
or
anybody
else
can
exclude
in
his
wisdom
anything
under
its
disability
program
as
long
as
it
cannot
be
proven
that
that
is
a
pretext
to
engage
in
invidious
discrimination
and
that
is
the
thing
that
is
missing
in
this
case
and
i
would
just
like
to
say
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
judge
webber
on
the
fourth
circuit
in
his
dissent
in
the
ge
case
which
is
of
course
is
again
the
next
case,
really
said
it.
and
i
might
in
end,
i
will
sit
down,
in
that
he
said,
the
inquiry
in
this
case
must
therefore
focus
initially
on
whether
exclusion
of
pregnancy
related
disability
from
the
disability
benefits
plan
is
sex
discrimination.
if
it
is
not
sex
discrimination,
then
regardless
of
what
test
is
applied
there
is
no
title
vii
violation.
absolute
showing
of
sex
discrimination,
title
vii,
even
if
its
reach
were
broader
than
the
equal
protection
clause
would
not
render
unlawful
a
pregnancy
exclusion
such
as
that
involved
here.
i
think
that
--
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
women
should
not
be
eligible
for
payments
due
to
alcohol;
i
think
that
in
that
type
of
situation,
the
burden
would
be
on
the
employer
to
explain,
does
it
have
a
rational
basis
for
excluding
that?
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
that
is
right.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
well
i
do
not
mean
just
the
use
of
the
word.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
not
if
you
are
just
using
the
word
semantics
and
not
if
you
are
just
putting
women
and
pregnancy
--
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
absolutely,
i
do
not
disagree
with
that
at
all.[laughter]
at
least
right
now
standing
here,
i
know
it
has
never
been
shown
otherwise
and
that
is
the
premise
of
this
case.
mr.
kalvin
m.
grove
none.
