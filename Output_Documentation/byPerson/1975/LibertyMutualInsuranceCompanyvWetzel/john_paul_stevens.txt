mr.
grove
you
make
reference
to
the
prior
position
of
the
eeoc
as
having
changed
and
i
could
not
find
it
in
your
brief,
maybe
it
is,
that
the
prior
opinions
of
the
eeoc
indicate
that
they
are
based
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
the
first
instance,
no
sex
discrimination
or
alternatively
where
they
are
based
more
or
less
on
the
ground
that
there
might
have
been
discrimination,
but
it
was
justified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
your
argument
in
this
case
relies
just
on
the
first
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
really
the
prior
eeoc
history
is
quite
irrelevant
to
the
issue
you
present
to
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
little
detail,
he
did
purport
to
make
a
54(b)
finding
now
in
the
language
of
the
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
not
look
for
it,
i
just
want
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
rule
54(b)
as
whether
it
is
multiple
claim
case
or
not,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
if
any
of
those
three
is
finally
adjudicated
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
is
the
damage
issue
resolved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
claim
is
not
finally
adjudicated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
repeat
because
i
have
the
same
problem
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
does.
which
claim
if
any
do
you
contend
has
been
finally
adjudicated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
issue
was
the
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
entitlement
to
an
injunction
or
entitlement
to
back-pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
argue,
you
do
not
get
to
the
pretext
question
until
you
have
raised
an
affirmative
defense.
if
on
its
face
the
plan
is
discriminatory
why
do
we
have
to
talk
about
pretext?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
by
like
reasoning,
is
there
any
reason
to
talk
about
costs
in
this
case?
could
you
for
example,
would
it
be
relevant
if
there
were
difference
in
pay
between
males
and
females
to
say
what
would
cost
more
the
increase
the
female
salary
level,
would
that
be
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
is
this
not
whole
case
turned
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
opponentâ€™s
analysis
in
my
dissent
in
spurgess,
have
you
read
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree,
that
is
not
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
if
one
applies
the
test
that
i
have
applied
there
to
this
case,
he
has
made
out
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
not
these
plaintiffs
not
face
a
particular
risk
if
they
were
male?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
they
not
avoid
the
risk
of
being
hospitalized
for
a
short
period
of
time
with
no
income,
if
they
were
male?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
i
will
not
try
to
rephrase
it?
