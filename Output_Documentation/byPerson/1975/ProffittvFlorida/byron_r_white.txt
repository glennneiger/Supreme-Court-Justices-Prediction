justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
filed
an
opinion
in
this
case,
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined
the
opinion
i
have
filed.
there
is
no
need
to
repeat
the
facts
of
the
case
or
to
restate
the
statutory
procedure
under
which
the
death
penalty
was
imposed.
we
agree
with
the
plurality
that
although
the
statutory
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances,
under
the
florida
statute
are
not
susceptible
to
mechanical
application,
they
are
by
no
means
so
vague
and
overbroad
as
to
leave
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
authority,
essentially
unfettered.
under
florida
law
the
sentencing
judge
is
required
to
impose
the
death
penalty
on
all
first
degree
murders
as
to
whom
the
statutory
aggravating
factors
out
weigh
the
mitigating
factors.
there
is
a
good
reason
to
anticipate
then
that
as
to
certain
categories
of
murders
the
penalty
will
not
be
imposed
freakishly
or
rarely
but
will
be
imposed
as
regularity
and
consequently
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
death
penalty
in
florida
as
to
those
categories
has
creased
to
be
a
credible
deterrent
or
majoribly
to
contribute
any
other
end
of
punishment
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
accordingly
as
we
see
it,
the
florida
statutory
scheme
for
imposing
the
death
penalty
does
not
run
of
afoul
of
this
court's
holding
in
furman
v.
georgia.
also
as
in
gregg
v.
georgia,
we
agree
with
the
plurality
in
rejecting
petitioner's
argument
that
under
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments
the
death
penalty
may
never
be
imposed
under
any
circumstances.
we
accordingly
concur
in
the
judgment
of
affirmance.
mr.
justice
blackmun
also
concurs
in
the
judgment
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
dissent
in
furman
v.
georgia.
