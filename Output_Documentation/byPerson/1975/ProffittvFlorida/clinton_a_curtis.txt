mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
court
has
already
heard
arguments
relating
to
the
discretionary
elements
and
features
of
the
pre
and
post
sentence
procedures
which
are
basically
the
same
as
those
that
exist
in
florida.
i
therefore,
limit
my
remarks
to
the
procedure
under
the
florida’s
post
furman
statutes
as
they
relate
to
the
actual
structuring
of
the
sentencing
procedure
itself.
florida’s
death
penalty
act
became
law
on
the
8th
of
december
of
1972
and
since
that
date,
some
70,
have
been
sentence
to
die,
19
of
the
sentences
have
thus
far
been
reviewed.
12
sentences
including
the
petitioners
have
been
affirmed
and
seven
vacated.
now,
i
understand
there
might
be
one
or
two
more
that
have
been
added
to
the
number
since
this
information
was
obtained
approximately
30
days
ago
but
that
is
as
close
as
i
could
get.
the
statutes
of
florida
provide
for
a
life
sentence
upon
conviction
of
a
capital
felony.
excuse
me.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
vacated
on
death
sentence.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
yes,
sir.
the
statutes
of
florida,
provide
that
a
life
sentence
will
be
imposed
upon
a
conviction
for
a
capital
felony
and
consisting
of
not
less
than
25
years
without
the
hope
of
parole,
and
this
capital
felony
is
defined
as
premeditated
murder
or
murder
during
the
commission
of
eight
enumerated
felonies
and
there
is
another
capital
felony
which
is
rape
of
a
child
11
years
or
under.
but,
the
imposition
of
the
life
sentence
is
mandatory
unless
the
death
penalty
is
determined
and
imposed
pursuant
to
the
new
death
penalty
act.
this
act
provides
for
a
bifurcated
procedure.
upon
conviction
for
a
capital
felony,
a
sentencing
hearing
this
conducted
before
the
same
trial
jury,
in
order
to
obtain
advice
and
advisory
recommendation
of
life
or
a
death
sentence.
no
reasons
need
to
be
given
in
the
verdict
returned
by
the
jury.
it
simply
is
a
statement
that
we
the
majority
have
determined
to
recommend
either
life
or
death,
and
that
is
basically
the
form
of
the
verdicts
giving
to
the
judge.
the
trial
judge
may
not
withstanding
the
juries
recommendation
and/or
either
a
sentence
of
life
or
death,
if
he
imposes
death,
he
is
required
to
file
written
findings
in
support
of
his
sentence.
the
statute
requires
review
of
all
death
sentences
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
eight
aggravating
and
seven
mitigating
circumstances
is
set
forth
from
the
statute
for
the
consideration
of
the
sentencer.
the
jury
for
advisory
purposes,
the
trial
judge
for
sentencing
purposes.
on
the
26th
of
july
of
1973,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
this
particular
act
constitutional,
acknowledging
that
there
was
discretion
in
the
sentencing
procedure
but
this
discretion
possible
and
necessary
was
reasonable
and
controlled
and
thereby,
complied
with
the
test
of
furman
versus
georgia.
the
petitioner
was
charged
in
july
of
1973
and
was
convicted
in
march
of
1974,
a
premeditated
murder
of
joel
medgebow
by
stabbing.
the
jury
recommended
and
the
trial
judge
imposed
a
death
sentence.
the
petitioners
claimed
that
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
was
rejected
on
the
authority
of
the
early
decision
on
state
versus
dixon.
we
submit
that
death
sentences
imposed
under
the
statute
are
arbitrary,
because
they
may
be
and
have
been
based
on
non-statutory
enumerated
factors,
and
at
the
uncontrolled
discretion
of
the
sentencer
is
permitted
and
required
to
interpret
or
valuate
and
apply
the
statutory
circumstances.
now,
in
the
petitioners
case,
the
trial
judge
found
and
set
forth
in
his
written
findings
four
aggravating
circumstances.
one
of
these
circumstances
was
that
the
defendant
had
the
propensity
to
commit
the
crime
for
which
he
was
charged
and
that
he
was
a
danger
and
menace
to
society.
this
is
not
one
of
the
statutory
enumerated
aggravating
circumstances.
by
affirming
this
death
sentence,
the
florida
supreme
court
approved
the
concept,
chief
justice.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
by
the
affirmance
itself,
and
in
an
earlier
case
in
sawyer
versus
state,
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
murder
and
robbery
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
affirmed
the
sentencers,
the
trial
judge
sentence
of
death.
citing
among
other
things
that
the
defendant
had
certain
--
excuse
me,
sir
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
if
i
said
jury,
i
intended
judge
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
that
is
correct.
you
see,
all
the
jury
does
under
this
system
is
to
return
a
verdict
of
recommendation.
then
the
trial
judge
in
the
event
and
only
in
the
event,
he
determines
to
impose
a
death
sentence,
he
prepares
a
series
of
written
findings
in
support
of
death
sentence.
i
must
point
out,
i
think
it
is
only
fair
to
do
so
that
in
state
versus
dixon,
there
was
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
supreme
court
would
urge
the
lower
courts
to
file
written
findings
in
the
event
that
they
determined
to
impose
life
sentences
also.
but,
i
found
as
a
matter
of
practice,
this
is
not
done.
but
in
any
event,
returning
to
the
point
your
honor
in
this
respect.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
there
were
three
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
and
one
non-statutory.
the
non-statutory
is
one
that
i
have
related
to
you.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
well,
the
course
of
the
argument
is
this.
if
the
trial
judge
felt
that
the
three
aggravating
circumstances
were
sufficient
to
support
his
position
that
the
death
sentence
should
have
been
imposed.
why
was
it
necessary
for
him
to
come
forward
and
come
with
a
non-statutory
aggravating
circumstance
and
this
will
become
more
relevant
as
we
get
into
the
discussion
of
sufficiency
which
is
this
weighing
process
that
florida
requires,
and
it
is
some
what
different
than
any
of
the
other
statute
that
had
been
thus
far
presented.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
in
the
written
findings
of
the
trial
judge
--
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
i
think
that
is
a
fair
assessment
of
it
your
honor,
yes.
now,
as
i
said
sawyer
versus
state
stands
for
the
same
proposition,
where
there
were
additional
non
aggravating,
non
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
cited
and
with
approval
when
the
trial
judge
cited
as
a
matter
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
took
these
facts
and
placed
them
in
a
notion
or
in
the
form
of
aggravating
circumstances,
and
those
facts
were
pending
robbery
charges
against
the
defendant.
the
defendants
demeanor
and
conduct
during
the
course
of
a
trial
as
well
as
defendants
alleged
incurable
drug
habit.
now,
the
supreme
court
has
also
approved
and
relied
on
a
non
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
form
of
a
defendants
or
record,
emotional
strain
of
the
defendant
as
well
as
sentences
that
have
been
administered
to
accomplices
or
co-defendants
which
are
less
than
death.
now,
we
advance
to
the
court,
the
notion
that
since
the
sentencer
may
relay
on
statutory
factors,
of
course
his
discretion
can
not
be
controlled
by
the
statute.
now,
to
the
point
of
weighing,
the
statute
permits
the
sentences
are
through
evaluation
of
the
enumerated
circumstances.
now,
according
to
the
statute,
the
sentencer
determines
whether
sufficient
aggravating,
or
mitigating
circumstances
exist,
and
whether
the
mitigating
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances.
nowhere
in
the
statute,
do
we
have
a
definition
of
the
term
sufficient.
the
weight
or
relative
significance
of
a
circumstance
or
a
combination
there
is
likewise
rather
not
in
the
statute.
well,
i
told
that
this,
this
circumstance
has
more
weight
or
is
entitled
to
more
weight
than
any
other.
in
other
words,
the
presence
or
absence
of
any
said
circumstance
or
combination,
does
not
compel
a
particular
result,
this
is
somewhat
different
than
the
federal
statute
where
you
have
aggravating
circumstances
and
if
that
is
found
to
exist,
such
and
such
result
will
occur
and
then
if
a
mitigating
circumstances
to
exist,
such
and
such
result
will
recur.
there
is
no
such
definition
in
our
statute.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
yes.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
yes
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
it
was
basically,
the
statute
provided
that
in
the
event
of
conviction;
death
would
follow
unless
the
jury
recommended
mercy
and
the
judge
had
absolutely
had
nothing
to
do
with.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
that
was
last
day
--
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
yes.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
i
am
not,
i
can
not
answer
quite
that
way
because
vagueness
has
been
sometime.
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
was
left
to
their
determination.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
yes,
oh
yes.
but,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
expanded
instruction
on
it,
yes,
i
really
do
not
recall
it
your
honor.
now,
the
supreme
court
has
stated
that
its
responsibility
in
this
overall
process
and
mind
you,
the
statute
is
not
define
what
the
supreme
court’s
responsibility
is
but
the
supreme
court
is
defined
that
it
is
to
review
a
death
sentence
case
in
the
light
of
facts
presented
in
evidence,
as
well
as
other
decisions,
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
sentence
of
death
is
too
great.
and,
no
opinion
that
has
been
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
thus
far
affirming
a
death
sentence
explains
why,
a
less
harsh
penalty
would
not
be
sufficient,
nor
does
any
opinion
compare
a
death
sentence
case
with
the
many
life
sentences
imposed
for
basically
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
type
of
conduct.
such
a
comparative
review
is
impossible.
it
is
frankly
impossible
since
the
many
life
sentences
are
reviewed
if
at
all
not
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
but
by
the
district
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
yes.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
as
of
statutory
direction,
it
goes
all
death
sentences
whether,
i
assume,
the
defendant
wishes
or
not.
it
will
be
automatically
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
but
in
the
situations
where
life
sentences
were
imposed
for
capital
felonies,
if
they
were
reviewed
and
i
say,
if
at
all
they
go
to
the
district
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
only
in
the
event
of
a
constitutional
question
or
you
have
--.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
that
is
basically
correct.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
none
whatsoever.
there
is
an
absence
of
expression
on
the
statute
on
that
point.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
well,
a
customary
review,
as
i
said
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
defined
its
review
as
something
more
than
just
customary,
i
would
say
it.
it
has
taken
upon
itself
not
only
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
or
what
have
you
but
also,
to
determine
in
the
--
to
take
upon
itself
to
a
way
whether
or
not,
this
death
sentence
is,
as
they
say,
too
great;
and
whether
a
less
harsh
punishment
would
be
adequate
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
it
is
a
total
review.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
seven
and
as
i
say
it,
this
is
my
recollection.
i
do
not
believe
any
of
the
seven
that
were
reversed,
were
reverse
because
of
insufficiency
of
evidence.
it
was
directed
totally
at
vacation
of
the
death
penalty
and
i
am
sure,
attorney
general,
shevin
will
correct
me
if
i
am
adhering
that
regard.
as
i
say
a
review
of
the
19
opinions
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
reflected,
there
is
no
meaningful
basis
for
distinguishing
the
death
sentence
cases
from
the
life
sentence
cases.
that
is
the
seven
that
have
then
vacated
and
i
realize
we
could
engage
in
a
discussion
that
this
case
means
this
and
that
case
means
that,
and
this
circumstance
should
be
interpreted
this
way.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
--
we
can
demonstrate
and
our
brief
does
discuss
just
this.
each
aggravating
circumstance
and
each
mitigating
circumstances,
we
feel
is
relevant
to
a
consideration
of
the
statute
that
lends
itself
to
the
vagueness
charge.
but
to
give
you
an
idea,
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
thinks
of
its
procedure
and
how
it
assesses
this
particular
statute,
i
invite
the
court’s
to
page
86
of
our
brief
and
i
would
only
quote
only
three
sentences
from
that
quoted
material,
and
this
is
from
the
alvord
case:
“the
law
does
not
require
the
capital
punishment
be
imposed
in
every
conviction
in
which
they
particular
state,
the
facts
occur.
certain
factual
situations
may
warrant
the
infliction
of
the
capital
punishment
but
nevertheless,
would
not
prevent
either
the
trial
jury,
the
trial
judge
or
this
court
from
exercising
reasoned
judgment
and
reducing
the
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
such
an
exercise
of
mercy
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
in
one
case
does
not
prevent
the
imposition
of
death
by
capital
punishment
in
the
other
case.
without
legislative
formulation
of
the
circumstances
or
combination,
there
are
which
warrants
executing
or
not
executing
a
defendant
the
decision
to
execute
is
nothing
more
than
the
function
of
the
sentencer.”
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
florida
death
penalty
act
permits
the
arbitrary
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
is
therefore
violated
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
thank
you.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
less
vulnerable
if
it
did
not
have
any
--
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
(voice
overlap).
excuse
me
for
interrupting.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
no,
i
do
not
think
the
removal
of
review
is
what
we
are
directing
ourselves
to,
it
is
not
having
meaningful
standards
to
guide
that
review,
so
that
everyone
knows
where
they
are.
in
other
words,
if
they
are
going
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
this
issue,
you
are
going
to
be
talking
about
this,
this,
and
this
and
it
is
going
to
be
fit
within
a
frame
work.
so
that,
if
a
particular
decision
is
affirmed
or
reversed,
it
is
affirmed
or
reversed
because
of
a
clear
reason
and
that
is
the
problem
we
have
with
the
review
that
is
we
have
here.
there
is
no
standards
really
that
truly
guide
the
sentencer
and
there
is
an
absence
standards
to
guide
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
its
review.
so,
i
am
not
urging
that
we
can
make
this
statute
good
by
eliminating
review,
quite
the
contrary.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
239
conviction.
yes,
sir.
of
those
239,
64
are
on
death
row,
64
accounts
for
about
29%.
again,
hardly
arbitrary
selectivity,
by
the
same
token,
mr.
justice
burger,
it
is
hardly
a
rubber
stamp,
it
is
not
a
rubber
stamp
when
we
have
at
least,
we
have
29%
of
the
cases
resulting
in
death.
it
is
not
a
rubber
stamp
when
the
supreme
court
reverses
in
one
third
of
the
cases
and
reduces
it
to
life
but
by
the
same
token
it
is
not
arbitrary
selectivity.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
just
one
or
two
comments
--
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
off
hand,
i
do
not.
there
has
been
a
number
of
statistics
submitted
in
the
one
or
more
or
several
of
these
briefs
and
that
is
one
of
the
matters,
i
would
like
to
address
my
self
to.
mr.
clinton
a.
curtis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
say
it,
i
will
accept
that
as
so.
i
have
never
thought
about
of
comparing
the
two
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
while
we
have
this
alleged
rate
of
increase
and
the
number
of
murders
and
none
of
this
here,
any
place
in
this
room
is
suggesting
that
we
approve
of
it
and
every
one
is
uphold
by
it,
but
to
say
that
because
of
the
absence
of
this
form
of
punishment
that
somehow
we
are
going
to
effectively
treat
that
particular
problem,
disallows
for
the
fact
that
every
other
form
of
serious
crimes
has
accelerated
--
far
greater
proportionate
and
assume,
we
assume
that
appropriate
punishment
is
being
meted
out
in
terms
of
what
the
legislature
thinks
ought
to
be
done
with
it.
but
i
do
not
wish
to
get
in
exchange
about
statistics
and
what
they
mean
or
what
the
effect
will
be,
but
i
would
like
to
comment
on
two
things,
one
attorney
general
referred
the
equal
justice
under
the
law.
well,
i
think
that
is
what
this
whole
argument
is
about
and
that
is
why
we
are
here
for.
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me,
that
in
swan
versus
state,
where
you
have
what
is
describe
by
the
trial
judge,
as
an
outrageous
wicked,
wild,
atrocious,
cruel
and
heinous
crime,
committed
during
the
course
of
a
robbery,
that
was
the
beating
death
of
an
elderly
house
keeper
and
the
supreme
court
in
light
of
those
two
aggravating
circumstances,
takes
the
position
that
and
i
quote,
“there
were
insufficient
aggravating
circumstances
to
justify
the
imposition
of
a
death
penalty.”
now,
if
we
are
going
to
have
standards,
which
attorney
general
shevin
is
suggesting
that
these
are
supposed
to
be,
we
are
going
to
have
standards.
what
is
good
for
mr.
swan,
is
good
for
mr.
proffitt
and
if
we
are
going
to
be
measured,
if
we
are
going
to
be
measured
by
the
jury,
the
sentencer,
or
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
we
are
being
measured
by
the
same
rules
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
see
justice
under
the
law.
i
thank
you
very
much.
