made
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
did
say
it
but
i
got
an
impression.
it
is
not
the
jury
you
are
talking
about
now?
this
isâ€”.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
for
the
extra
one
articulated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
position
is
that
now,
the
reviewing
court
then
and
now
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
might
have
been
the
dominant
one
or
the
decisive
one,
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
assuming
that
the
judge
in
furman
that
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
as
of
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
your

not
clear
furman
hurdles.
do
you
then
asked
the
chairman
the
overruled?
.
chief

thank
you
mr.
attorney
general.
do
you
have
anything,
further
mr.
curtis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
a
question
before
you
start,
the
growing
rate
of
homicides
in
florida
at
the
present
time,
how
many
thousands
a
year
or
hundred?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
hardly
a
large
city
in
america
including
washington
that
does
not
have
more
homicides
every
year
than
all
the
european
countries
this
side
of
the
iron
curtain.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
would
be
emerged
in
these
briefs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
