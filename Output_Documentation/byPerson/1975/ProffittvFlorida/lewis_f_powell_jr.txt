justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
have
the
judgment
to
announce
in
75-5706,
proffitt
against
the
state
of
florida.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
of
florida.
it
presents
the
challenge
to
the
capital
punishment
statute
of
that
state.
as
the
justices
says
who
have
preceded
have
stated.
the
threshold
question
that
fundamental
one
presented
in
all
five
of
the
cases
here
today
is
as
follows.
whether
the
punishment
of
death
for
the
crime
of
murder,
is
under
all
circumstances
cruel
and
unusual,
in
violation
of
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
if
we
had
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative,
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
consider
this
statute
and
the
procedures
in
these
five
states.
as
has
been
indicated
seven
members
of
the
court
have
concluded
that
capital
punishment
is
not
unconstitutional
per
se.
mr.
justice
white
speaking
for
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
summarized
their
reasons
for
agreeing
with
this
conclusion.
i
now
speak
for
justices
stewart,
stevens
and
myself
in
our
joint
opinion
in
gregg
v.
georgia.
we
elaborate
on
our
reasons
for
reaching
the
same
conclusion.
we
incorporate
these
reasons
by
reference.
in
the
joint
opinions
filed
by
the
three
of
us,
in
each
of
the
other
four
cases.
the
precedence
of
this
court
extending
over
many
years,
established
the
guiding
principles.
the
eighth
amendment
is
not
a
static
concept,
it
draws
its
meaning
from
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
marked
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society.
a
penalty
must
not
involve
unnecessary
and
wanton
infliction
of
pain
nor
can
it
be
substantially
out
of
proportion
to
the
severity
of
the
crime.
as
long
as
the
penalty
specified
by
the
legislature
comports
with
these
criteria,
we
must
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
on
this
basic
issue.
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
death
penalty
was
contemplated
when
the
constitution
was
adopted.
it
was
a
traditional
penalty
both
in
the
colonies
and
in
england.
the
text
of
the
fifth
amendment
reiterated
in
part
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
75
years
later,
makes
clear
the
acceptance
of
capital
punishment
and
in
the
nearly
two
centuries
of
our
national
existence
until
1972,
this
court
repeatedly
and
often
expressly
recognized
that
capital
punishment
is
not
invalid
per
se.
in
trop
against
dulles,
decided
in
1958,
then
chief
justice
warren,
in
the
same
opinion
in
which
he
spoke
of
evolving
standard
of
decency,
said
this.
“the
death
penalty
has
been
employed
throughout
our
history
and
in
a
day
when
it
is
still
widely
accepted,
it
cannot
be
said
to
violate
the
constitutional
concept
of
cruelty.”
the
first
major
challenge
to
the
per
se
validity
of
capital
punishment
reached
this
court
in
1972
in
furman.
although
the
issue
was
strongly
presented
in
that
case.
it
was
not
then
resolved
by
the
court.
four
justices
would
have
held
that
capital
punishment
is
not
invalid
per
se.
two
would
have
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
and
three
justices
while
agreeing
that
the
statues
then
before
the
court
were
invalid
as
applied,
left
open
the
question
whether
such
punishment
may
ever
be
imposed.
the
principal
argument
presented
by
petitioners
in
furman
was
that
standards
of
decency
had
evolved
to
the
point
where
capital
punishment
was
no
longer
tolerated
in
this
country.
it
was
said
then
that
the
eight
amendment
must
be
construed
finally
as
prohibiting
capital
punishment
for
any
crime
regardless
of
it's
depravity
and
of
it's
impact
on
society.
petitioners
in
the
prior
cases
the
other
day
have
renewed
the
standard
of
decency
argument.
but
as
mr.
justice
white
has
noted,
developments
during
the
four
years
since
furman
have
undercut
substantially,
the
assumptions
upon
which
that
argument
was
advanced.
objective
criteria
demonstrate
that
prevailing
standards
in
our
country
do
not
reject
capital
punishment,
at
least
as
a
sanction
in
some
cases.
the
most
marked
indication
of
society's
endorsement
of
the
death
penalty
for
murder,
is
a
legislative
response
to
furman.
the
legislatures
of
at
least
35
states
and
the
congress
of
united
states
had
enacted
new
statutes
that
provide
for
this
penalty
at
least
for
some
murders.
the
jury
also
is
a
reliable
objective
index
of
contemporary
values.
it
has
a
fearful
responsibility
and
is
directly
involved,
and
yet
since
furman
and
under
the
new
statutes,
juries
across
the
country
have
imposed
the
death
penalty
in
more
than
400
cases.
but
the
eight
amendment
demands
more
than
a
finding
that
a
challenged
punishment
is
acceptable
to
contemporary
society.
as
noted
above
a
penalty
may
not
be
substantially
out
of
proportion
to
the
severity
of
a
crime
nor
may
it
be
totally
without
penological
justification.
we
cannot
say
that
the
infliction
of
death
as
a
punishment
for
murder
is
without
justification.
in,
part
capital
punishment
is
an
expression
of
society's
belief.
that
certain
crimes
are
so
grievous,
so
grievous
and
upfront
to
humanity
that
the
only
adequate
response
is
a
penalty
of
death.
in
part,
capital
punishment
also
reflects
a
legislative
judgment
that
the
sanction
is
necessary
to
deter
capital
crimes.
there
is
no
conclusive
empiric
data
either
proving
or
disproving,
the
value
of
the
penalty
as
a
deterrent.
yet
we
may
assume,
we
do
assume
that
there
are
murders
,
such
as
those
committed
in
the
heat
of
passion
for
which
the
threat
of
depth
has
little
or
no
deterrent
effect.
but
there
are
others,
for
example
those
are
deliberately
planned
in
advance,
where
the
penalty
may
well
be
a
deterring
factor,
and
in
some
cases,
such
as
murder
by
a
life
prisoners
there
is
no
other
adequate
sanction.
the
evaluation
of
the
unresolved
debate
concerning
deterrents
properly
rests,
as
mr.
justice
white
has
said
with
the
legislatures.
they
have
the
flexibility
and
the
means
to
ascertain
the
facts
that
are
quite
unavailable
to
the
judiciary.
it
is
well
to
remember
that
are
we're
consent
in
these
cases
only
with
the
imposition
of
capital
punishment
with
the
crime
of
murder.
we
conclude
when
a
life
has
been
taken
deliberately
that
the
punishment
of
death
is
not
invariably
disproportionate
to
that
crime.
it
is
an
extreme
sanction,
but
it
is
suitable
for
the
most
extreme
of
crimes.
i
come
now
briefly
to
the
florida
case
itself.
i
will
not
state
the
facts
beyond
saying
that
petitioner
in
the
course
of
an
unlawful
entry
into
a
private
home
at
3
am
in
the
morning,
stabbed
to
death
his
sleeping
victim
and
beat
the
victim's
wife.
the
florida
statute
in
all
material
respects
provides
the
same
procedural
and
substantive
safeguards
as
a
judge
of
statute
described
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
florida
provides
for
a
bifurcated
procedure.
in
this
case
after
the
jury
had
found
petitioner
guilty,
a
separate
hearing
was
held
to
determine
whether
the
sentence
should
be
death
or
life
imprisonment.
the
florida
statute
requires
consideration
of
specified
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
acting
in
light
of
these
the
jury
recommended
the
sentence
of
death.
the
trial
judge
then
imposed
that
sentence
and
identified
in
writing
for
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
again
as
in
georgia,
for
automatic
review
the
florida
supreme
court
is
required
by
statue.
that
court
reviews
and
evaluate
the
sentence
in
comparison
with
and
to
assure
consistency
with
similar
cases.
for
reasons
more
fully
stated
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
these
safeguards
provide
the
procedural
protection
that
prevent
the
wanton
and
freakish
imposition
of
capital
punishment
that
was
held
unconstitutional
in
furman
against
georgia.
accordingly
mr.
justice
stewart,
justice
stevens
and
i
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
as
the
chief
justice
and
three
other
justice
concur
in
the
result.
this
is
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
