mr.
robert
l.
shevin
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
about
five
different
areas
in
the
time
that
i
have.
one
is
to
look
at
the
death
penalty
itself,
secondly,
the
eight
amendment
question
i
know
you
have
heard
a
lot
on
it
today
but
i
do
want
to
comment
on
that
question
per
se.
i
want
to
comment
on
mr.
amsterdam’s
attack
on
the
system
because
i
think
that
is
pivotal
and
i
do
not
care
what
he
calls
it.
what
he
is
really
doing
is
attacking
the
whole
system.
he
is
really
talking
about
due
process
regardless
whether
he
calls
it
eight
amendment
or
not.
because
he
says
he
is
concern
about
the
fairness
of
the
system
and
that
is
due
process,
it
is
nothing
else.
i
would
like
to
talk
about
our
statute;
i
would
like
to
talk
about
our
case.
counsel
quoted
just
before
he
sat
down
from
the
alford
case,
the
alford
or
the
alvord
case,
both
of
them
are
in
this
court.
the
alvord
case
involve
in
upholding
of
the
death
sentence
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
that
case
involved
a
mass
murder,
a
man
who
wiped
out
an
entire
family,
he
raped
and
then
killed
a
grandmother,
a
mother
and
a
daughter.
so,
i
do
not
think
that
case
speaks
to
the
issue
of
any
discrimination
or
arbitrariness
in
the
application
of
the
death
sentence.
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
inquired
on
each
of
the
statutes
as
to
whether
they
provided
full
appellate
review.
the
florida
statute
does
provide
full
appellate
review.
the
florida
statute,
under
florida
law,
the
supreme
court
can
reverse
for
insufficient
evidence,
the
supreme
court
has
the
inherent
power
to
reduce
a
charge
from
first
degree
murder
to
second
degree
murder
to
even
man
slaughter.
so,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
that
authority,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
also
reviews
the
sentence.
now,
this
may
be
the
only
case
that
it
is
before
you
in
which
the
sentence
is
specifically
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
and
has
been
demonstrated
in
some
19
cases.
they
have
upheld
the
death
penalty
in
13
cases
and
changed
it
from
death
to
life
in
six
cases,
hardly
an
arbitrary
selectivity.
when
one
third
of
those
has
resulted
in
a
bringing
down
of
the
penalty
from
death
to
life.
also,
the
supreme
court
is
required
to
read
the
entire
record
whether
or
not
there
is
error
alleged
and
all
of
this
we
contend
is
in
response
to
furman.
it
was
in
response
to
furman
that
we
created
a
bifurcated
system,
that
we
created
standards
for
the
jury
on
the
basis
of
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
and
that
we
created
appellate
review
of
the
sentence.
mr.
amsterdam
says,
death
is
different.
we
recognized
death
as
different
that
is
why
we
provided
all
these
safeguards
in
death
penalty
cases,
because
it
is
different.
and,
i
suggest
to
you
that
he
does
not
want
us
to
treat
it
different,
he
wants
a
different
result,
not
a
matter
of
treatment,
a
matter
of
result.
i
would
also
point
out
that
our
bifurcated
hearing
goes
to
aggravation
and
mitigation
and
it
does
involve
not
just
the
facts
of
the
murders
itself
but
the
unique
qualities
of
the
defendant.
all
of
the
factors
concerning
each
particular
defendant
and
in
each
of
this
cases
and
i
intend
to
review
them,
there
is
a
reason
why
the
supreme
court
changed
it
from
death
to
life,
either
it
had
to
do
family
squabble
or
it
affected
the
age
of
the
defendant
or
it
involved
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
had
no
prior
criminal
record.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
how
many
cases
we
had
in
florida,
mr.
justice
white
asked
that
question
several
times
today.
in
florida,
we
have
had
in
the
past
three
years
under
the
new
death
penalty
law,
some
239
cases
that
have
been
tried
that
that
could
result
either
in
death
or
life,
239
capital
cases.
of
those
239.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
convictions
of
239
cases
that
went
to
a
jury
where
the
death
penalty
could
have
been
returned.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
yes,
239
convictions,
they
made
--
some
of
those
convictions
might
have
been
--
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
that
is
correct.
alright,
counsel
mentioned
the
written
findings,
and
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
the
maturing
case
law
on
this
death
penalty
statute
has
required
judges
below
to
enter
detailed
written
findings
even
when
they
conclude
life
imprisonment
rather
than
death.
the
concept
being
to
allow
the
supreme
court
to
be
able
to
look
at
those
cases
as
well.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
at
this
point
that
you
could
point
anything
that
would
indicate
whether
it
is
going
up
or
down.
i
think
as
far
as
the
number
of
cases
that
are
going
to
trial,
we
have
more
murders
in
florida
and
as
a
result
we
have
more
cases
going
to
trial
and
we
probably
have
more
men
on
death
row
now.
and,
in
response
to
your
question
of
mr.
justice
stevens
asked,
we
probably
have
a
few
more
men,
it
is
not
much
difference
than
we
did
pre
furman.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
i
have
not
asked
in
our
brief
for
you
to
overrule
furman.
i
do
think
there
is
an
inherent
conflict
between
mcgautha
and
furman.
i
do
not
think
you
can
reconcile
those
two
cases
because
in
mcgautha,
you
say
basically
that
juries
are
going
to
make
the
right
decision.
in
furman
you
say
basically
that
they
may
not.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
the
reason
why
we
do
not
say
that
is
because
we
came
back
and
adopted
the
statute
with
standards
and
appellate
review.
we
did
not
adopt
the
mandatory
death
penalty
statute.
we
think,
we
have
met
furman
and
therefore,
since
we
feel
we
have
met
furman.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
no,
we
are
satisfied
with
the
system
that
we
have
adopted
post
furman.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
if
it
can
clear
furman
hurdles,
we
would
ask
it
to
be
overruled
but
we
really
do
believe
that
we
provided
a
system
that
meets
the
arbitrariness
that
has
been
outlawed
in
furman.
counsel
talked
about
propensity,
and
he
said
this
was
an
issue
that
came
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
and
the
jury
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
aggravating
circumstances
enumerated
in
the
statute,
and
the
chief
justice
at
that
point
said,
well,
how
did
they
determine
propensity
or
whether
he
would
be
a
danger
to
society,
very
simply
he
said,
he
will
kill
again.
we
have
a
testimony
in
the
record
of
the
psychiatrist
of
the
doctor,
and
he
was
asking
him,
this
was
subsequent
to
the
trial,
the
psychiatrist
at
the
hearing
testify
this
was
after
they
waved
confidentiality.
he
felt
that
he
would
do
damage
to
people
in
the
future
that
he
already
had
done
damage
to
the
people
that
he
had
killed
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
page
423
of
the
testimony,
“further
more,
he
was
having
similar
feelings
beginning
to
build
up
in
the
cell
in
which
he
was
confined,
and
he
felt
this
degree
of
hostility
being
directed
towards
a
specific
inmate.
he
told
the
doctor
and
this
was
part
of
the
testimony
that
the
judge
and
jury
heard
on
whether
or
not
he
should
get
death
or
life.
he
told
the
doctor
he
was
going
to
kill
again.
that
he
had
this
urge
to
kill
again,
that
he
might
even
kill
an
inmate
in
the
jail
cell.”
now,
where,
why
should
not
the
judge
be
able
to
consider
that?
why
should
not
the
propensity
to
kill?
now,
when
that
came
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
recognized
that
was
not
one
of
the
enumerated
aggravating
circumstances
but
the
florida
supreme
court
through
maturing
case
law
on
this
subject
has
in
effect
in
several
of
this
cases
expanded
the
aggravation
and
expanded
mitigating
circumstances.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
gardner
case,
they
say
that
a
psi
saying
that
someone
is
going
to
be
a
menace
to
a
society
can
be
considered.
in
the
hallman
case,
they
said
fact
that
the
defendant
was
non-rehabilitable,
can
be
considered,
in
our
case
in
the
proffitt
case,
the
propensity
to
commit
another
crime
was
added
aggravating
circumstances.
in
the
sawyer
case,
sawyer
said
he
was
going
to
kill
the
judge,
he
said,
when
i
get
back
out
of
the
prison,
i
am
going
to
kill
the
judge,
i
am
going
to
kill
the
prosecutor.
so,
this
judicial
threat
was
considered
as
an
additional
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
your
honor,
the
statute
says
that
they
can
consider
all
relevant
material,
the
supreme
court
has
said
anything
that
it
is
relative
of
probative
value
and
has
not
been
admitted
in
violation
of
a
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
florida
can
be
considered
as
long
as
it
deals
with
either
aggravation
or
mitigation.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
oh
yes,
i
think
so.
in
this
case
there
were
four,
only
one
of
them
was
non-statutory.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
want
to
point
out
the
fairness
of
this
procedure
because
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
also
found
some
non
enumerated
mitigation
circumstances.
again,
relevancy
is
the
key.
in
this
slater
case,
they
reduce
it
from
death
to
life
because
a
co
conspirator
had
gotten
life
and
they
felt
it
was
unfair
to
give
one
of
them
death
when
the
other
one
got
life.
so,
that
was
the
basis
of
reducing
it
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
in
the
taylor
case,
there
was
question
as
to
whether
he
actually
pulled
the
trigger.
they
were
not
sure
he
pulled
the
trigger
and
as
a
result
they
reduced
it
because
they
were
not
sure
he
was
the
trigger
man.
in
the
gardner
case,
they
said
intoxication
is
an
unenumerated
mitigating
circumstance.
in
the
swan
case,
it
was
a
non
deliberate
killing.
it
was
a
felony
murder
and
they
beat
this
woman
but
they
said
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
intended
to
kill
her.
they
put
her
in
a
closet
and
because
of
a
preexisting
medical
condition
she
died
in
the
closet
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
it
was
basically
a
non
deliberate
felony
killing
and
as
a
result
it
could
be
mitigated.
in
the
proffitt
case,
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
danger
to
society.
he
will
kill
again
by
his
own
statement.
he
has
a
propensity
to
kill.
he
has
an
uncontrollable
appetite
to
kill
which
has
not
been
--
which
is
not
synonymous
with
diminished
mental
capacity.
there
has
been
testimony
in
the
record
by
two
psychiatrists
that
he
understood
the
criminality
of
his
act.
there
was
not
one
mitigating
circumstances
and
there
were
four
aggravating
circumstances.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
powell,
you
asked
in
the
last
case
what
kind
of
review
can
be
held
by
the
supreme
court
and
is
there
any
basis,
any
standard
for
that
review.
in
the
dixon
case
which
is
our
leading
florida
case,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
review
by
this
court
guarantees
that
the
reasons
presented
in
one
case
will
reach
a
similar
result
to
that
reached
under
similar
circumstances
in
another
case.
no
longer
will
one
man
die
and
another
live
in
the
basis
of
race
or
a
woman
live
and
the
man
die
on
the
basis
of
sex.
if
the
defendant
is
sentenced
to
die,
this
court
can
review
that
case
in
light
of
all
the
other
decisions
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
punishment
is
too
great.
they
go
on
in
the
case
to
say
that
we
consider
at
reasonable
to
require
the
trial
judge
to
emulate
detail
written
finding
even
when
he
imposes
light.
even
though
the
statute
said
it
was
only
required
when
he
imposed
death.
so,
i
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
matured
this
law,
has
rounded
out
the
circle
and
has
set
forth
under
what
circumstances
the
death
penalty
can
be
applied
and
under
what
circumstances,
it
cannot
be
applied
and
all
of
this
we
contend
has
been
done
subsequent
to
furman
in
order
to
meet
furman.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
well,
the,
as
i
point
out
a
moment
ago
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
said,
we
want
the
judges
to
enter
written
findings,
even
in
the
life
cases
and
they
have
been
traditionally
argued.
every
time
someone
comes
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
if
they
think,
there
is
a
life
case
similar
to
theirs
that
ought
to
get
them
life
rather
than
death.
they
rely
on
it
very
heavily
and
those
are
reported
cases
in
the
southern
reporter
and
they
are
available
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
even
though
they
are
not
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
we
contend
they
are
available
and
are
considered
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
absolutely,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
let
me
relate
to
the
cases
they
referred
to,
because
i
think
this
is
very
significant.
on
page
85
of
their
brief
they
say,
“there
appears
no
rational
explanation
as
to
why
petitioner
must
suffer
death
while
the
convicted
murderers
swan
and
halliwell
and
taylor
were
spared”.
now,
in
this
case,
it
was
spared
after
the
discretionary
review
of
the
supreme
court,
so
it
is
a
little
different
than
the
question
you
asked
but,
let
me
talk
about
those
three
cases.
in
the
swan
case
there
was
a
beating,
the
woman
was
beaten,
again,
he
did
not
beat
her
to
try
to
kill
her,
he
put
her
in
a
closet
and
she
died.
the
supreme
court
said,
it
was
a
non-deliberate
homicide
and
that
is
why
they
reduced
it
to
life
in
the
swan
case.
in
the
halliwell
case,
it
was
a
love
triangle,
a
family
squabble
no
prior
record,
the
defendant
in
the
case
was
a
vietnamese
or
a
vietnam
war
veteran,
excuse
me,
he
was
a
green
beret,
the
supreme
court
said
he
has
been
desensitized,
he
was
a
green
beret,
he
had
severe
emotional
disturbance
and
it
is
true,
after
he
killed
this
person,
after
he
killed
this
man,
he
cut
the
body
up
in
to
a
little
pieces
and
dispose
off
it
and
the
supreme
court
had
to
consider
was
that
heinous,
was
that
atrocious?
and
they
concluded
that
he
cut
the
body
up
after
the
killings.
so
therefore,
it
was
not
particularly
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
and
that
is,
i
think,
a
logical
position
that
the
court
could
have
taken
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
killing
had
already
occurred.
so,
there
were
circumstances
concerning
the
defendant
in
the
halliwell
case.
in
the
tedder
case,
again,
it
was
a
domestic
squabble,
there
was
a
killing
in
this
case
of
a
mother-in-law,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said,
it
was
not
particularly
heinous,
there
were
no
prior
circumstances.
in
the
thompson
case,
which
they
rely
upon,
the
defendant
was
a
17
year
old
boy,
again,
with
no
prior
criminal
record.
now,
the
one
case
they
point
out,
where
if
i
was
sitting,
i
might
have
reached
the
different
conclusion
was
the
powers
case,
the
powers
case
was
a
young
man
in
their
appendix,
i
think
it
is
very
convenient
that
they
said,
his
age
was
not
available
from
the
record,
his
age
was
available,
and
his
age
happened
to
be
18
and
obviously
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
lower
court,
this
was
the
case
where
the
lower
court,
the
jury
recommended
the
death,
the
judge,
imposed
life,
and
in
this
case
it
was
rather
a
heinous
crime.
he
broke
or
he
came
in
to
a
store,
he
showed
no
remorse
afterward,
he
sat
the
man
down
on
a
chair,
and
he
shot
three
bullets
in
his
head.
now,
if
i
were
sitting
on
that
case,
perhaps
i
would
have
reached
a
different
conclusion
and
perhaps
i
would
have
imposed
death.
but,
what
is
interesting
about
the
powers
case
it
does
involve
a
young
man
who
the
court
felt
below
had
been
culturally
deprived,
it
did
involve
a
young
man
who
was
less
than
18
years
old,
who
had
less
than
a
fifth
grade
education
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
judge
felt
that
life
was
sufficient
and
the
other
interesting
point,
is
that
at
the
time,
the
power’s
case
was
decided
the
supreme
court
of
florida
had
not
yet
decided
dixon.
so,
the
lower
court
judge
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
dixon
case
or
any
of
the
maturing
case
law
at
the
time
he
imposed
life
on
powers.
the
gentry
case
is
another
case,
involving
a
domestic
quarrel,
no
criminal
record,
fifth
grade
education.
those
are
the
cases
he
refers
to
and
we
contend
that
there
has
no
showing
of
discrimination
that
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
was
not
arbitrary
selectivity,
that
in
each
of
those
cases
it
involves
cases
in
which
there
was
ample
reasons
for
mitigation.
he
does
not
tell
you
about
a
case
which
is
pending
in
your
court.
the
alford
case,
a
case
involving
the
rape
and
murder
of
a
13
year
old
girl
in
palm
beach,
who
was
both
vaginally
and
anally
assaulted
and
then
shot
eight
times,
twice
in
the
head.
he
does
not
tell
you
about
another
case
pending
in
your
court
involving
an
11
year
old
boy,
who
happened
to
be
riding
his
bicycle
on
the
wrong
street
at
the
wrong
time
and
was
mutilated,
torn
limb
from
limb.
and,
these
are
the
kind
of
cases,
these
are
the
kinds
of
heinous
cases
that
we
have
pending
has
a
result
of
the
crimes
that
are
committed
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
asked
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
proceeding,
you
asked,
would
not
the
kind
of
elaborate
statutes
that
mr.
amsterdam
was
complaining
about
the
so
called
winnowing
devices,
would
not
they
have
been
predicted
or
expected
under
furman,
and
he
said,
well,
we
might
have
predicted
mandatory
death.
well,
let
me
mention,
let
me
talk
about
that
for
just
a
moment.
when
i
first
read
furman
and
everybody
is
going
through
the
same
throws.
what
did
furman
mean?
what
did
it
say?
what
is
required?
i
was
concerned
that
may
be
we
were
required
to
pass
a
mandatory
death
penalty;
i
did
not
like
that,
because
i
do
not
think
that
mandatory
death
penalties
in
and
of
themselves
are
the
fairest
kinds
of
justice.
and
then,
when
we
reread
furman,
we
particularly
read
what
the
chief
justice
said,
when
he
said
that
“legislative
bodies
may
now
seek
to
bring
their
laws
in
to
compliance
with
the
courts
ruling
by
providing
standards
for
juries
and
judges
to
follow
in
determining
the
sentence
by
more
narrowly
defining
the
crimes
for
which
there
to
be
imposed
or
determining
or
providing
standards
for
juries
and
judges.
well,
that
is
exactly
what
florida
did,
florida
eliminated
rape
from
its
capital
crime
category
accepted
that
it
involves
the
rape
of
a
young
child
less
than
11.
so,
it
narrowed
the
crimes
and
florida
for
the
first
time,
provided
standards.
it
provided
aggravating
circumstances
and
providing
mitigating
circumstances,
and
provided
by
bifurcated
hearing,
and
provided
a
review,
all
of
these
things
precisely
what
the
legislature
did
in
response
to
furman.
but,
i
think
this
is
more
important,
when
i
went
to
the
legislative
committees
and
in
their
brief
they
quote
my
statements
saying
that
“mandatory
is
probably
the
safest
way
to
go”.
and,
when
i
went
to
the
legislative
committee
that
is
the
position
i
took
after
having
read
furman
once
or
twice,
and
when
i
went
to
the
legislative
committees,
the
expression
of
the
legislative
body
was
this:
“we
would
rather
pass
a
good
law,
a
fair
law,
that
might
be
suspect
than
to
pass
mandatory
death
penalty
even
if
it
is
allowed
by
furman”
because
it
is
harsh,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
legislation
that
the
florida
legislature
passed.
they
did
not
pass
mandatory
death.
they
have
attempted
to
remove
the
arbitrariness
from
the
system,
they
have
attempted
to
remove
the
discretion
so
that
we
have
reasoned
judgment
which
is
the
conclusion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
they
have
attempted
to
have
review,
which
is
so
very,
very
important.
they
agreed,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
with
you
mr.
chief
justice,
that
to
provide
mandatory
death
was
a
step
backward.
now,
every
state
had
to
do
their
own
thing,
and
had
to
make
their
own
decision
but,
that
was
a
decision
of
the
florida
legislature
and
we
have
responded
to
furman.
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
even
though
he
did
not
mention
it
today,
in
his
brief
he
says,
that
the
death
penalty
is
still
being
applied
dis
proportionally
to
blacks
and
to
poor
people.
now,
may
be
that
was
true
prior
to
furman,
maybe
that
was
true.
but,
it
is
not
true
under
florida’s
new
death
penalty
law.
in
1973,
'74,
and
'75,
those
three
years
since
we
have
had
our
new
law,
more
blacks
have
been
arrested
for
killing,
for
murder
than
whites.
about
one
third
more,
and
yet
on
death
row
today,
today,
not
when
the
brief
was
filed,
but,
today
we
have
64
people
on
death
row
and
out
of
those
64,
34
of
them
are
white
and
30
of
them
are
black.
so,
we
actually
have
more
people
who
happen
to
be
white
on
death
row
than
black
people.
yet,
the
proportionate
numbers
of
those
kinds
of
crimes
being
committed
happen
to
be
about
a
third
higher
going
the
other
way.
we
think
this
demonstrates
that
we
have
even
handed
justice
in
florida
and
incidentally,
one
third,
one
third
of
all
those
on
death
row
in
florida
retain
their
own
counsel,
not
court
appointed
counsel.
so,
we
do
not
have
just
poor
people
on
death
row.
we
do
not
have
just
black
people
on
death
row.
we
have
even
handed
justice.
let
me
comment
on
the
deterrent
aspects,
if
capital
punishment
does
not
deter,
then
punishment
does
not
deter.
the
whole
pain,
pleasure
philosophy
of
society
is
based
on
the
theory
that
punishment
does
deter,
and
the
ultimate
punishment
deters
the
most.
it
obviously
deters
that
individual
who
cannot
kill
again.
it
deters
the
robbers
and
the
rapist
who
will
sustain
a
greater
punishment
for
murder
than
for
rape
or
robbery,
and
therefore
may
not
eliminate,
the
only
eye
witnesses
to
the
crime
in
order
to
avoid
apprehension
and
we
think,
it
deters
homicides
generally.
mr.
justice
powell,
you
commented
earlier
about
the
increase
in
homicides,
which
you
were
amazed
that
had
gone
over
50%.
the
figures
are
really
quite
higher
than
that.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
murder
rate
in
this
country,
in
1930,
1940,
1950,
all
the
way
up
to
1965,
you
will
find
that
there
were
approximately
7,000
to
9,000
murders
committed
each
and
every
year.
that
figure
has
jumped
from
between
7,000
and
9,000
up
to
22,000.
this
is
the
decision,
the
legislature
made.
this
is
the
decision
that
they
had
the
right
to
make
and
we
contend
that
this
is
basically
a
legislative
decision
that
contemporary
standards
of
decency
are
determined
by
what
the
legislature
and
what
the
people
want.
since,
i
only
have
a
few
moments
left,
i
want
to
direct
my
attention,
if
i
may
to
the
question
of
the
system.
what
they
are
saying
is,
that
because
of
this
discretion,
the
system
is
wrong.
now,
obviously,
they
do
not
want
a
system
in
which
only
capital
offenses
can
be
charged,
in
which
only
first
degree
murder
charges
can
be
brought
back,
in
which
no
clemency
can
be
exercised.
but
that
is
exactly
what
they
are
saying
to
us
today.
mr.
justice
white,
in
an
argersinger
versus
hamlin,
you
told
the
state
of
florida
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference,
whether
a
man
was
facing
a
misdemeanor
charge
or
a
felony
charge,
the
inside
of
a
jail
looked
the
same.
and,
i
contend
that
the
inside
of
the
jail
looks
the
same,
to
someone
under
life
imprisonment
or
five
years
or
99
years
as
it
does
to
someone
facing
the
ultimate
punishment.
if
the
eight
amendment
argument,
if—.
mr.
robert
l.
shevin
the
court
said
that,
yes
sir.
i
was
talking
about
during
the
discourse
of
the
argument.
if
the
eight
amendment
argument,
if
the
eight
amendment
argument
that
he
says
applies
only
in
capital
cases.
logically,
legally
you
cannot
apply
that
only
in
capital
cases.
true
death
is
different
but
the
eight
amendment
does
not
apply,
just
the
capital
cases,
the
eight
amendment
applies
and
has
traditionally
been
applied
to
less
than
capital
cases,
and
the
due
process
provision
talks
about
life,
liberty
or
property,
and
if
you
are
going
to
deprive
somebody
of
life,
and
you
are
going
to
say
we
cannot
do
that
because
there
is
prosecutorial
discretion,
jury
discretion,
executive
clemency.
i
submit
to
you
that
same
argument
applies
to
a
lifer,
and
even
though
mr.
amsterdam
stands
before
this
court
and
says,
i
am
only
trying
to
apply
it
in
death
cases,
there
is
no
way
he
can
foreclose
someone
who
is
under
a
life
sentence,
coming
back
to
this
court
and
saying,
give
me
that
same
protection,
equal
justice
under
law.
that
is
what
the
front
of
the
building
says,
and
that
is
exactly
what
a
lifer
is
going
to
say.
that
is
exactly
what
a
man
under
five
years,
20
years
or
99
years
is
going
to
say.
he
is
going
to
say,
that
if
you
say
the
whole
system
is
wrong,
then
it
is
wrong
as
to
him
as
well,
and
for
those
reasons,
we
urge
you
to
affirm
this
conviction
to
state
in
effect
that
the
whole
system
is
not
wrong,
to
state,
the
capital
punishment
is
not
cruel
and
unusual
per
se,
and
that
it
cannot
be
applied
as
an
eight
amendment
violation
just
in
capital
cases,
so
as
to
attack
in
effect,
the
entire
criminal
justice
system.
