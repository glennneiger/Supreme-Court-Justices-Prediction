seven
were
vacated,
was
that
in
connection
with
the
convictions
or
--.
unknown
speaker
just
on
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
mr.
curtis,
while
you
were
interrupted
there,
there
were
four
aggravating
circumstances
here.
one
of
which
was
a
non-statutory,
is
it
not?
were
the
other
three
found
by
the
trial
judge
be
statutory?
unknown
speaker
but
why
was
not
the
fourth,
simply
superfluous
and
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
course
of
argument
there?
unknown
speaker
a
pre
furman
did
the
jury
sentence?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
instruction
to
the
jury
then
about
sentencing,
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
they
say
to
the
jury
about
mercy,
anything?
unknown
speaker
within
your
discretion
or
what?
unknown
speaker
did
they
expressly
say
that?
unknown
speaker
does
that
death
sentence
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
was
there
any
possibility
of
afterwards
going
to
the
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
a
certiorari
jurisdiction
here
or
roughly
so.
unknown
speaker
the
florida
statute
prescribed
any
special
standards
for
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
law
unknown
speaker
comparable
to
those
in
georgia?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
review?
i
understand,
i
am
not
--
unknown
speaker
do
the
questions
on
the
merits
go
with
the
review
on
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
and
to
what
extent,
the
convictions
have
been
upset
in
cases
--
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question.
would
you
say
that
statute
will
be
less
vulnerable
if
it
did
not
have
any
appellate
review?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
you,
you
are
pointing
out
that
the
supreme
court
is
without
a
reasoned
basis
granted
mercy
in
seven
out
of
nineteen
cases
when
some
of
the
other
12
are
really
comparable--
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
wondering
if
your
argument
was
death
disparity
could
be
removed
by
removing
a
appellant
review
entirely?
unknown
speaker
239
convictions?
unknown
speaker
general
shevin.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that,
there
were
239
convictions.
you
do
not
mean
convictions
with
sentence
of
death,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,just
so
i
understand,
the
non-statutory
additional
aggravating
circumstances
is
not
a
substitute
for
statutory
circumstance,
just
additional
fact
that
may
be
considered.
unknown
speaker
but
it
remains
true
that
one
of
the
ten
statutory,
or
whateve
the
number
is,
aggravating
circumstances
must
be
filed
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
