mr.
beals,
that
is
the
information
the
government
did
furnish
you
was
that
acceptable
or
rejected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
has
not
been
in
the
form
of
an
application
would
have
permit,
when
you
grant
it
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
any
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
have
a
complaint
on
those?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
you
just
want
the
formality
of
asking
for
permit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
those
that
did
meet
the
standards?
the
only
thing
the
objective
of
the
government
did
also
say
we
want
a
permit,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
give
you
all
the
information
that
they
would
have
given,
if
it
applied
for
permit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
all
you
asked
for
was
that
did
they
applied
for
permit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
you
just
wanted
to
go
through
the
formality
in
some
instances?
