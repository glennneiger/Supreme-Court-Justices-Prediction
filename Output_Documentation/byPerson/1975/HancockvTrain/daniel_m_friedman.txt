mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
advert
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
put
to
my
opponent,
what
if
anything
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
doing
to
ensure
compliance
by
federal
facilities
with
state
pollution
standards.
it
is
doing
a
great
deal.
it
has
its
own
office
called
the
office
of
federal
activities
whose
sole
function
is
to
ensure
that
federal
facilities
do
come
in
to
compliance.
the
record
contains
numerous
items
of
evidence
showing
that
the
various
federal
facilities
in
the
commonwealth
of
the
kentucky
have
supplied
a
great
deal
of
information,
a
great
deal
of
data
have
worked
closely
with
the
state
authorities
to
ensure
that
as
quickly
as
possible
the
federal
facilities
do
come
in
to
compliance
with
the
state
emission
standards,
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
the
substantive
standards
that
the
state
has
imposed
in
implementing
the
federal
plan
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
can.
we
endeavored
to
do
that
and
indeed
there
is
document
in
the
record
of
direction
from
the
regional
administrator
which
instructs
all
the
federal
facilities
to
work
closely,
to
cooperate
with
the
state
authorities
and
to
submit
to
them
their
own
plans,
their
own
schedules.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
informal
discussion
and
communication.
i
mean,
the
compliance
standard
for
major
installation;
it
is
not
a
simple
thing.
it
is
very
complicated.
there
are
all
sorts
of
standards.
they
are
problems
about
the
technology
available.
it
is
not
something
unfortunately
that
can
be
done
very
quickly.
it
does
take
time
but
the
federal
facilities
are
moving
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
try
to
accomplish
this.
and
this
is
we
think
precisely
what
congress
intended
in
section
118
of
the
act
when
it
said
that
the
federal
facilities
are
to
comply
with
state
and
local
requirements
with
respect
to
the
emission
of
the
pollutants.
the
question
in
the
case
basically
is
whether
when
congress
used
that
word
“requirements”
in
there,
it
intended
also
to
subject
the
federal
instrumentalities
to
the
various
procedures
that
the
state
might
work
out
in
order
to
accomplish
compliance
within
the
state
with
these
various
requirements.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice
because
now
all
states
have
permit.
some
call
them
permits.
some
call
them
registration,
there
is
a
wide
variety
in
the
plan.
but
i
think
it
is
essential
and
i
think
this
has
been
brought
out
in
the
colloquy
with
my
opponent
as
to
what
we
really
are
talking
about
here.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
it
wants
the
authority
to
control
the
way
in
which
the
federal
instrumentalities
are
operating
within
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
what
the
state
permit
regulation
provides
is
that
you
must
have
a
permit
in
order
construct,
use,
operate
or
maintain
an
air
contaminant
facility.
and
i
think
it
was
brought
out
very
clearly
that
if
the
state
believes
that
fort
knox
is
not
complying
with
its
standards,
it
can
shutdown
fort
knox.
i
think
this
whole
concept
that
the
state
somehow
has
a
veto
power
over
the
operation
of
federal
facilities
runs
and
flies
in
the
face
of
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
for
more
than
150
years,
that
ordinarily
unless
there
is
a
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
do
so,
that
these
federal
facilities
are
not
subject
to
control
by
the
states
and
that
the
states
cannot
require
federal
facilities
to
obtain
a
permit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
whether
in
118
congress
has
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
precisely
and
clearly
indicated
that
the
federal
facilities
are
--
but
i
think
in
determining,
i
think
mr.
justice
in
determining
whether
118
has
that
effect,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
this
broad
back
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
thing
but
our
submission
is
that
before
one
can
conclude
the
congress
intended
to
subject
the
federal
facilities
to
this
kind
of
state
control
there
has
to
be
some
clear
indication
that
congress
did
so.
and
our
submission
is
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
subject
the
federal
facilities
to
state
permit
requirements.
my
opponent
has
considered
there
is
nothing
explicit.
and
when
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
thought
as
i
understood
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
he
has
conceded.
he
has
conceded
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
he
is
conceded
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
explicitly
refers
to
permits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
says
it
used
the
word
“requirements.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
does
not
say
substantive
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
does
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
is
not,
with
all
due
respect
mr.
justice
it
is
not
a
question
of
leaving
it
out.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it
means
only
substantive.
we
think
it
means
only
substantive
and
we
think
that
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
that
is
precisely
we
think
what
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
shows
that
what
congress
is
intending
to
do
in
this
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
do
not
think
that
the
shutting
down
–-
i
agree
that
the
federal
administration
is
required
to
enforce
the
standards
just
as
rigorously
as
the
state
is
doing.
that
is
precisely
what
we
do
but
the
question
of
shutting
down
fort
knox
it
seems
to
me
is
not
a
substantive
standard
and
i
would
think
that
that
is
a
matter
for
the
federal
authorities
to
decide
if
they
feel
it
is
necessary
to
shut
down
fort
knox
because
it
is
not
complying
with
the
pollution
requirement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
remedies
mr.
justice,
the
remedies
are
themselves
tied
into
permit
requirement
because
if
you
have
a
state
permit
requirement
then
you
cannot
operate
unless
you
have
obtained
the
permit.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
think
than
the
situation
where
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
federal
facilities
to
comply
with
the
state
substantive
standards
but
if
there
is
non-compliance,
there
are
two
remedies
available
either
the
state
can
sue
as
the
state
of
alabama
is
suing
tva
or
alternatively
the
federal
authorities
can
take
whatever
steps
are
necessary
to
bring
the
state,
the
federal
facilities
in
the
state
into
compliance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
does
not
say
mr.
justice
with
all
due
respect
to
try
to
come
around
within
five
years.
they
tell
them
that
they
have
to
comply
and
they
are
taking
every
step
possible
to
comply
as
rapidly
as
possible.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
only
question
really
is
whether
the
state
can
require
the
federal
facility
to
obtain
a
permit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
i
would
hope
that
it
would
never
come
to
that
but
the
state
apparently
claims
the
power.
that
is
the
thing.
under
the
argument
that
it
can
apply
its
permits
to
the
federal
facilities
the
state
would
claim
the
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
in
an
escape
clause
but
it
has
been
interpreted
rather
narrowly
because
it
says
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
close.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
it
is
not
just
that.
it
is
a
lot
of
other
things
in
connection
with
the
permit,
the
way
in
which
the
federal
facility
operates.
for
example,
one
of
the
facilities
involved
in
this
case
is
the
aecs
gases
diffusion
plant
which
enriches
uranium.
now,
i
suspect
there
is
probably
a
fair
amount
of
pollution
involved
in
that
and
steps
are
being
taken
but
the
notion
that
the
state
commonwealth
of
kentucky
can
in
effect
say
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
unless
you
do
not
operate
this
plant
the
way
we
want
you
to,
you
will
not
get
a
permit
and
threaten
them
with
closing
down.
it
seems
to
me
that
before
one
could
find
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
states
that
kind
of
power
there
have
to
be
some
very
clear
indication
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
not
think
it
could
close
it
down
mr.
justice.
it
could
bring
a
lawsuit
under
section
304
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
so
and
i
would
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
one
assumes
that
i
would
think
the
court
would
order
them
to
comply
and
if
they
fail
to
comply,
the
court
has
whatever
sanctions
are
available
to
compel
compliance.
i
would
assume
that
once
a
court
tell
the
federal
facility
that
it
was
not
in
compliance
in
order
for
it
to
comply
it
would
comply.
one
must
assume
that
i
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
original
bill
that
was
passed
by
the
house
directed
that
federal
facilities
would
have
comply
with
local
emissions
standards.
and
the
house
committee
report
on
the
bill
said
the
same
thing
that
would
direct
the
federal
facilities
to
comply
with
local
emission
standards.
now,
if
that
is
all
that
you
had,
there
could
be
not
much
question.
we
think
that
clients
with
local
emission
standards
means
that
and
does
not
mean
complying
with
permit
standards.
the
senate
bill
use
different
language.
it
said
it
should
comply
with
the
requirements
in
this
act
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
person
should
comply
but
the
significant
thing
to
us
is
that
the
senate
committee
in
reporting
this
bill
saw
no
difference
apparently
between
the
word
'requirements'
in
this
bill
and
a
emission
standards
in
the
house
bill
because
it
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
section
using
the
words
“requirements”
was
to
acquire
federal
facilities
to
meet
the
emissions
standards
necessary
to
achieve
ambient
air
quality
standards
as
well
as
those
established
in
other
sections
of
title
1.
now,
when
the
conference
committee
came
along
and
adapted
the
language
now
in
the
bill
to
comply
with
their
requirements
to
the
same
extent
as
every
other
person
what
it
said
is
that
the
language
it
was
using
required
that
the
government
comply
with
requirements
respecting
control
of
air
pollution
that
it
said,
this
house
bill
and
the
senate
amendment
declared
that
the
federal
departments
and
agencies
should
comply
with
applicable
standards
of
air
quality
and
emission
standards,
standards
of
air
quality
and
emission.
now
if
the
conference
committee
believed
that
in
using
the
word
of
the
senate
bill
“requirements”
rather
than
using
the
word
“emission
standards”
of
the
house
bill
that
it
would
somehow
changing
the
standard.
it
seems
to
us,
most
extraordinarily
that
it
did
not
indicate
that
to
the
contrary
what
it
indicated
is
that
it
view
the
same
the
two
phrases
as
meeting
the
same
thing.
and
this
is
i
think
particularly
brought
out
by
the
fact
that
the
very
next
sentence
in
the
conference
report
points
out
that
in
one
respect,
it
was
changing
the
bills.
what
it
said
was
the
conference
substitute
modifies
the
house
provision
to
require
that
the
president
rather
than
the
administrator
of
epa
be
responsible
for
assuring
compliance
by
federal
agencies.
now,
it
pointed
out
the
change
it
was
making
and
saying
that
it
was
to
be
the
president
rather
than
the
administrator
of
epa
who
is
responsible
for
ensuring
federal
compliance
by
federal
agencies
but
yet
it
treated
the
word
emission
standards
and
requirements
in
the
two
versions
of
the
legislations
as
meaning
the
same
thing
and
the
same
thing
it
said
it
meant
was
standards
of
air
quality
and
emission.
moreover,
it
seems
to
us
would
be
most
extraordinary
we
think,
that
after
the
conference
committee
said
that
it
was
giving
the
president,
responsibility
for
ensuring
compliance
with
the
standards
of
air
quality
emissions
that
it
then
would
have
turned
around
and
expected
that
the
president
would
have
to
comply
with
state
permit
provisions.
now
we
have
set
out
at
length
in
our
brief
a
number
of
respects
in
which
we
think
the
word
“requirements”
in
the
statute
reflects
a
congressional
intention
to
cover
only
the
substantive
standards
and
not
the
procedural
ones.
many
of
them
are
rather
detailed
in
technical
and
not
particularly
appropriate
for
oral
presentation.
but
let
me
just
refer
to
one
particular
provision,
which
i
think
dramatizes
it
very
clearly
that
is
in
section
110(e)
1(a)
and
it
provides
that
after
the
state
has
approved
the
plan
for
compliance.
if
a
particular
emission
source
is
unable
to
achieve
compliance
with
the
deadlines
because
of
technological
problems
that
period
for
compliance
may
be
extended.
now,
there
the
requirements
with
which
they
can
extend
the
time
for
compliance
because
of
technological
problems,
obviously
refers
to
the
substantive
standards
the
problems
that
because
of
the
lack
of
technology,
they
are
not
able
to
control
particular
emissions.
it
cannot
refer
in
any
meaningful
sense
of
the
term
to
any
technological
problems
with
respect
to
seeking
a
permit.
and
if
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
in
that
provision
was
to
reach
the
permit
thing.
it
seemed
to
me,
it
would
not
have
put
it
in
those
terms.
now
we
have
a
final
point
which
this
court
relied
on
in
its
train
opinion
last
year
which
is
that
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency,
who
is
the
person
charged
with
enforcing
this
statute
has
interpreted
it
as
not
applying
to
federal
facilities.
he
did
it
in
a
1972
ruling
and
a
1973
ruling.
i
should
mention
that
the
1972
ruling
which
is
embodied
in
a
letter
from
the
regional
administrator
of
epa
in
the
region
involved
here
at
page
57
of
the
appendix
points
out
the
importance
of
the
federal
instrumentalities
submitting
their
compliance
schedules.
it
is
not
just
the
substantive
standards
the
federal
instrumentalities
are
to
meet
the
state
compliance
standards.
one
final
point
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
he
is
a
party
but
he
is
also
a
party
in
the
train
case
mr.
justice
in
which
this
court
placed
considerable
reliance
on
his
interpretation.
and
indeed,
in
most
litigation
which
this
court
has
applied
the
principle
of
giving
weight
to
the
administrative
determinate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
usually
is
suit
to
challenge
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
ordinary
party
however
does
not
have
the
expertise
of
the
administration.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
here
by
the
commonwealth
as
to
the
importance
of
the
desirability
of
requiring
the
federal
instrumentalities
to
obtain
permits.
if
this
is
the
most
effective
way,
in
which
one
can
assure
compliance,
that
it
seems
to
us
is
a
matter
for
the
congress
to
consider
because
we
think
that
the
statute
as
it
is
written,
its
language,
its
structure,
its
legislative
history
rather
clearly
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
subject
the
federal
facilities
to
state
permit
requirements.
if
that
is
to
be
changed,
we
think
it
is
for
congress
to
change
it
and
rather
significantly
there
is
now
pending
before
the
congress
a
rather
lengthy
bill
which
would
revise
the
clean
air
act
in
many,
many
particulars.
and
one
provision
of
that
bill
would
provide
that
from
now
on
if
this
bill
is
passed
federal
facilities
would
be
required
to
obtain
permits
from
states
if
the
state
so
required.
that
we
think
is
the
way
in
which
if
federal
facilities
are
to
obtain
permits
that
congress
should
make
its
intention
clear
and
explicit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
a
fair
summary
but
then
our
answer
is
that
in
this
kind
of
situation
unless
congress
clearly
intended
to
permit
this
kind
of
state
authority
it
should
not
be

it
is
the

of
authority
we

that
has
to
be
provided
explicitly.
thank
you.
