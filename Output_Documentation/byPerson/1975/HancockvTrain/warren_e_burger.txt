chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
hancock,
the
attorney
general
of
kentucky
against
train
the
administrator
of
epa.
mr.
beals
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
the
environmental
agency
state
that
it
would
submit
all
of
the
information
which
is
called
for
about
the
application
but
would
not
submit
it
in
the
form
of
an
application
for
reasons
which
were
given.
now,
does
that
not
give
you
everything
that
the
application
would
give
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
cannot
you
not
tell
them
that
when
they
submit
the
data
that
they
have
offered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
everything
you
get
in
an
application?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
if
you
really
had
the
authority
to
require
permit
you
could
say
no
to
an
application,
whereas
if
you
do
not
have
the
authority
require
permit,
all
you
can
do
is
kind
of
file
what
they
are
doing
and
not
say
no?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
read
the
government’s
brief,
you
get
the
impression
that
the
government
installations
will
fully
comply
with
the
substantive
requirements
and
presumably
epa
and
that
is
what
is
regulating
the
government’s
installations
would
be
saying
no
in
place
of
the
state
agency.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
compliance
schedule
originates
at
the
time,
the
permit
is
issued?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
at
least
for
me
fully
answered
the
questions
of
justice
blackmun
or
justice
marshall
or
the
ones
i
was
trying
to
put.
if
the
environmental
agency
is
prepared
to
have
the
federal
facility
to
everything
that
it
would
do
except
the
formality
of
the
application
and
that
you
are
free
to
respond
in
the
same
way
to
that
issue
would
be
to
a
formal
application
in
terms
of
setting
up
the
schedule,
then
what
are
we
really
here
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
have
you
responded
to
the
informal
approach
just
the
way
you
would
to
a
formal
application?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
starting
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
congressional
program
broken
down
in
the
states
that
do
not
have
a
permit
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
those
as
possible
that
each
of
the
states
has
its
own,
it
is
likely
that
each
have
their
own
schedules
and
own
notions
about
how
the
compliance
can
be
accomplished
so
that
there
will
be
no
uniformity
applicable
to
all
federal
installations,
is
that
the
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
would
be
another
case
and
another
day
when
we
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
they
can
close
fort
knox?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
white
has
four
opinions,
judgments
and
opinions
to
announce
for
the
court
and
will
identify
each
of
them
with
his
announcement.
