mr.
david
d.
beals
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
to
review
that
court's
interpretation
of
the
cleaner
act
amendments
of
1970
as
that
act
concerns
the
relations
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
and
the
operator
and
the
respondent
operators
of
existing
federal
air
contaminants
sources
located
in
the
commonwealth
kentucky.
with
the
passage
of
the
cleaner
act
in
1970,
the
congress
set
forth
the
clearly
define
and
discernible
plan
for
the
enhancement
and
enforcement
and
protection
of
the
air
resources
of
the
united
states.
basic
to
this
plan
were
minimum
standards
to
be
prescribed
by
the
epa
administrator
under
section
109.
the
congress
stated
the
means
by
which
these
standards
would
be
put
into
effect.
in
section
107,
directing
that
the
states
would
have
implementation
plans
to
achieve
and
maintain
the
national
primary
and
secondary
ambient
air
quality
standards.
that
these
plans
were
state
plans,
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
scheme
of
the
act.
in
101(a),
one
of
the
findings
of
the
congress
with
respect
to
air
pollution
was
that
it
was
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
state
to
control
and
abate
air
pollution
at
its
source.
indeed,
section
101(b)
listed
as
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
assist
the
states
and
local
governments
in
the
formulation
and
execution
of
their
air
pollution
programs.
as
to
what
these
programs
should
at
a
minimum
contain,
congress
was
also
very
explicit.
in
section
110,
they
listed
a
number
of
requisites
which
had
to
be
included
in
any
one
county
implementation
plan.
among
these
the
basic
requirement
of
the
plans
was
that
the
plan
provide
for
the
attainment
of
the
primary
standards
as
expeditiously
as
possible
and
in
no
case,
more
than
three
years
following
approval.
also
required
in
110
were
provisions
for
emission
limitations,
schedules,
timetables
for
compliance
and
such
other
measures
as
might
be
deemed
necessary
to
meet
these
standards.
but
in
addition
to
these
emission
standards,
110
also
specified
that
the
states
had
to
incorporate
into
their
plan,
appropriate
devices,
methods
and
systems
for
monitoring,
compiling
and
analyzing
data
and
making
this
data
available
to
the
administrator,
appropriate
procedures
and
systems
for
reviewing
the
location
and
new
sources,
appropriate
procedures
to
ensure
that
no
emission
in
one
air
quality
region
would
cause
or
interfere
with
the
attainment
of
the
standards
and
in
the
other
air
quality
region.
it
also
called
for
adequate
personnel
spending
and
authority
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
carry
out
the
plan.
it
required
that
the
plan
have
authority
to
require
the
installation
and
monitoring
equipment
to
require
periodic
reports
from
air
contaminant
sources,
to
correlate
this
data
received
from
these
reports
to
the
emission
standards
that
were
currently
existing
and
required
authorization
to
restrain
any
air
pollutant
source
which
was
presenting
an
eminent
and
substantial
danger
to
health.
the
contention
of
the
common
law
of
the
kentucky
that
these
requirements,
all
of
the
requirements
listed
in
110,
all
the
requirements
which
are
contained
in
the
states
implementation
plan
are
requirements
respecting
the
control
and
abatement
of
air
pollution.
mr.
david
d.
beals
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
envision
a
situation
where
if
the
control
strategy
proposed
by
a
federal
source
will
in
the
opinion
of
the
state
air
pollution
control
agency
not
result
in
the
attainment
of
the
ambient
standards,
will
not
result
in
the
meeting
of
the
admitting
standards
that
that
federal
source
would
have
to
redraft
its
control
strategy,
its
compliance
schedule
so
that
it
would
indeed
meet
these
standards
as
required
by
the
act.
mr.
david
d.
beals
at
the
permit
stage,
these
things
can
be
worked
out.
we
say
your
strategy
is
not
sufficiently
stringent
to
meet
our
standards.
your
emissions
are
too
high
to
maintain
the
air
quality
required.
therefore
you
have
to
incorporate
more
standards.
this
is
as
opposed
to
later
finding
that
they
are
indeed
in
violation
of
the
standards
and
presumably
shutting
down,
that
is
a
possibility,
highly,
unlikely
that
any
of
the
agencies
would
be
indeed
shut
down
by
they
would
be
subject
to
daily
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
we
are
indeed
your
honor
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
the
implementation
plan
as
expressed
by
congress
contains
considerably
more
than
just
identification
of
the
sources
of
pollution
and
it
contains
considerably
more
than
simply
emission
standards.
it
contains
the
entire
mechanism
for
bringing
these
standards
into
being
for
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
would
hardly
be
prevention
your
honor.
we
might
be
able
to
abate
any
violations
that
came
up
later.
but
it
would
hardly
relate
to
any
sort
of
preventive
concept,
since
the
time
for
prevention
is
before
the
attainment
dates.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
pre-attainment
period
seeing
to
it
that
these
control
strategies
are
moving
into
proper
direction,
that
the
strategies
will
indeed
result
in
reduced
emissions,
will
indeed
result
in
the
air
quality
of
the
entire
air
quality
control
region
being
raised
to
a
level
expectable
under
the
minimum
standards,
minimum
primary
and
secondary
standards.
mr.
david
d.
beals
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
that
gives
everything
that
the
application
would
give
you
but
it
does
not
give
you
what
the
permit
requires.
the
application
for
permit
is
not
an
automatic
issue
in
some
department.
mr.
david
d.
beals
once
again
your
honor,
the
ambient
standards
are
interfered
with
the
attainment
and
likeness
of
the
ambient
standards
are
interfered
with
if
we
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
but
the
data
they
offer
is
just
a
status
report.
that
is
a
listing
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
yes
but
the
process
does
not
stop
at
the
application.
the
process
goes
on.
we
use
the
information
that
we
get
from
the
application
to
determine
what
sort
of
controls
are
necessary,
to
determine
what
kind
of
emission
standards
are
necessary
to
be
imposed.
this
does
not
stop
with
just
getting
the
information
and
finding
out
where
we
are
and
waiting
until
three
years
later
to
see
if
we
got
any
better.
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
we
can
do
right
now.
that
is
what
we
have
been
doing
for
the
last
three
years.
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
would
have
been
fine,
if
the
administrator
had
come
in
1972
under
313
when
the
implementation
plan
broke
down
when
they
refused
to
comply
with
the
implementation
plan,
what
the
installations,
what
the
respondents
have
done
so
far
is
when
requested
not
on
the
basis
of
a
periodic
report,
when
requested
they
have
submitted
a
status
report.
this
is
not
similar
to
a
compliance
schedule.
the
respondents
are
not
operating
under
any
approved
compliance
schedules
because
the
compliance
schedule
is
the
end
result
of
the
process
that
starts
with
the
permit
application.
the
position
of
the
government
that
they
are
to
comply
with
compliance
schedules
and
emission
standards
is
generally
hard
for
me
to
follow
since
there
are
no
compliance
schedules.
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
way
the
kentucky
permit
system
functions,
the
information
is
received
on
the
applications.
that
information
is
analyzed
to
see
what
steps
are
necessary
to
bring
the
source
into
compliance.
if
the
source
is
already
in
compliance,
then
a
permit
may
be
issued.
if
a
source
is
not
in
compliance
then
no
permit
will
be
issued
until
a
compliance
schedule
which
will
bring
the
source
into
compliance
within
the
attainment
days
has
been
agreed
to
by
the
source.
mr.
david
d.
beals
it
was
taken
as
what
it
was.
the
original
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
in
some
cases
perhaps
it
would
have
been.
in
most
cases
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
this
case
deals
with
quite
a
number
of
different
respondents.
mr.
david
d.
beals
some
of
them
may
have
gotten
the
permit.
some
of
them
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
the
complaint?
i
do
not
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
beals
no,
we
want
the
cooperation.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
they
did
not
apply
for
a
permit.
mr.
david
d.
beals
only
those
few
sources
and
i
am
not
sure
how
many
of
them,
there
are
which
would
be
in
compliance.
in
fact,
the
information
only
application
is
just
the
preliminary
information
through
which
the
analysis
could
start.
it
would
still
require
some
further
information,
further
cooperation
by
the
respondents.
as
to
those
sources
which
would
not
be
in
--
we
have
asked
for
the
further
information.
we
get
status
reports.
mr.
david
d.
beals
in
asking
that
they
applied
for
a
permit,
we
are
asking
that
they
submit
to
our
entire
implementation
plan
system.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
in
the
instances
where
they
are
already
in
compliance,
i
agree
if
they
applied
for
permit,
they
would
be
granted
a
permit.
but
those
are
a
very
few
and
far
between
sources
which
are
already
in
compliance.
they
have
already
met
all
of
the
emission
standards.
in
addition,
the
information
that
we
gather
from
these
applications
are
necessary
in
order
to
determine
at
what
level
the
emission
standard
should
be
set.
it
is
not
just
an
automatic
process
that
they
apply
for
a
permit,
they
get
a
permit.
what
they
have
to
do
is
go
through
the
permit
process.
the
determination
is
made
but
whether
or
not
these
strategies
will
bring
them
into
compliance
with
the
ambient
standards,
they
will
be
in
compliance
with
the
emission
standards
which
are
set
through
the
information.
the
air
quality
control
region
is
analyzed
to
determine
what
sources
are
there,
what
levels
of
control
need
to
be
placed
on
these
sources.
only
through
this
process,
can
the
emission
standards
be
set.
now,
the
fact
that
the
initial
information
was
put
in
is
just
the
very
first
step
in
the
whole
permit
process.
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
planning
required
in
determining
how
to
bring
a
plant
such
as
the
shawnee
power
plant
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority
into
compliance
with
the
emission
standards
within
three
years.
in
fact,
it
has
not
been
done
under
the
system
that
the
government
suggests
where
the
only
standards
which
they
have
to
meet
are
the
emission
standards
and
compliance
schedules.
this
is
very
similar
to
the
method
of
implementation
that
was
considered
in
train,
they
discussed
the
florida
method
where
we
just
told
in
three
years
you
have
to
be
in
compliance.
and
that
was
it.
this
method
was
discouraged
by
epa.
this
is
the
method
we
have.
we
say,
we
are
turning
it
loose
but
in
three
years,
you
have
to
be
there.
the
state
suggests
that
this
is
a
regulatory
statute
that
the
state
has
some
expertise
in
determining
what
their
air
quality
control
regions
require
in
terms
of
emission
standards.
in
developing
these
emission
standards
for
the
particular
areas,
the
louisville,
for
instance,
the
louisville
air
control
region
has
considerably
more
stringent
standards
than
the
bowling
green
air
control
region.
this
is
developed
through
a
complete
control
over
each
stationary
source
in
the
commonwealth.
we
have
to
analyze
the
data
from
each
of
these
sources
in
order
to
make
the
standards
for
all.
for
the
section
118
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
we
are
here
for
the
fact
that
they
have
not
than
that.
mr.
david
d.
beals
perhaps
not
but
we
have
not
had
the
same
information.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
the
informal
approach
nonetheless
is
totally
unrelated
to
our
implementation
plan.
the
congress
said
that
we
have
to
have
this
authority.
they
said
that
this
is
essential
to
achieving
thee
plans
and
what
these
respondents
have
declared
is
that
none
of
these
are
the
things
are
essential
to
achieving
these
standards
except
the
emission
standards.
no
other
way
to
compliance
schedules
come
into
being.
they
have
not,
as
i
say,
we
have
not
gotten
control
strategies
from
these
sources.
we
get
status
reports
which
they
say,
right
now
we
are
putting
out
this
much
emission.
we
are
installing
this
sort
of
equipment.
there
is
no
opportunity
or
review
to
control
strategies.
there
is
no
opportunity
review
to
control
strategies
in
light
of
the
rest
of
the
air
quality
control
region.
mr.
david
d.
beals
not
specifically
your
honor.
the
federal
statute
requires
that
the
states
draw
an
implementation
plan
containing
a
certain
set
of
authorities.
now,
the
majority
of
substantial
majority
of
the
states
have
adapted
a
permit
system
in
order
to
accomplish
this.
the
permit
system
integrates
all
the
requirements
of
110.
it
integrates
all
the
control
necessary.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
it
has
been
approved.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
yes,
but
it
has
been
approved
by
the
federal
epa.
it
has
been
published
as
regulations
of
the
federal
epa.
in
effect,
the
kentucky
implementation
plan
is
the
federal
implementation
plan
for
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky.
mr.
david
d.
beals
the
federal
statutory
authority?
mr.
david
d.
beals
i
take
it,
that
there
would
be
not.
mr.
david
d.
beals
however,
if
section
118
clearly
makes
that
is
the
federal
statutory
authority
which
makes
all
state
and
federal
requirements
respecting
control
and
abatement
of
air
pollution
applicable
to
each
of
these
federal
respondents.
in
that
regard
what
we
adapt
as
a
requirement
respecting
control
and
abatement
under
section
110
which
is
republished
as
a
federal
requirement
respecting
control
and
abatement
of
air
pollution
by
the
federal
epa.
we
would
think
that
those
would
be
federal
requirements
that
are
–-
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
is
exactly.
yes,
we
are
preceding
under
118.
we
are
saying
that
there
is
a
federal
duty
under
section
118.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
the
point
where
you
–-
mr.
david
d.
beals
because
the
permit
will
give
us
everything.
the
permit
will
get
us
–-
mr.
david
d.
beals
administratively,
it
is
practically
impossible
to
go
after
each
requirement
of
the
permit
system
individually.
we
would
have
to
go
after
emergency,
episode
regulations
separately.
we
would
have
to
go
after
monitoring
separately
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
other
than
the
proliferation
of
federal
district
court
suits
that
that
would
bring
on.
that
just
is
not
what
we
consider
the
plan,
that
the
congress
had
for
the
enforcement
of
the
standards.
that
puts
us
in
federal
district
courts
suing
every
two
weeks,
if
the
periodic
report
does
not
come
in
on
time,
we
have
to
follow
another
suit
to
get
the
same
information
again.
mr.
david
d.
beals
it
has
indeed
your
honor.
the
implementation
plan
–-
mr.
david
d.
beals
i
find
that
in
the
record
by
the
fact
that
none
of
the
respondents
herein
are
committed
to
compliance
schedules.
you
will
find
that
in
the
record
in
may
of
1975,
a
month-and-a-half
before
the
attainment
dates.
the
epa
is
just
then
trying
to
find
out
whether
anybody
is
in
compliance.
in
a
publication,
in
a
federal
register,
the
epa
has
put
out
their
guidelines
to
make
a
firm
public
commitment,
to
abate
air
pollution
from
federal
sources.
this
is
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
implementation
plan
require
the
state
to
do
in
1972
which
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
did
do
and
had
that
system
been
allowed
to
function
as
it
should
as
not
only
as
kentucky
law
but
as
a
federal
regulation
for
kentucky.
then,
the
same
thing
that
the
administrator
is
trying
to
do
in
1975
would
have
been
doing
in
1972
we
would
be
much
closer
meeting
the
standards.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
that
would
be
the
direction
of
the
clean
air
act
that
is
what
they
say
that
we
should
do.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
no
section
suggests
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
close
down
fort
knox.
however,
as
in
terms,
as
far
as
the
air
pollution
control
measures
taken
by
fort
knox,
we
should
be
allowed
to
review
them.
the
citizens
of
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
are
breathing
air,
we
have
the
air
quality
control
regions
and
there
is
no
reason
why
under
the
federal
act,
and
under
the
direction
of
118
which
declares
that
they
shall
comply
with
requirements
respecting
that
they
cannot
produce
a
compliance
schedule.
mr.
david
d.
beals
well,
i
take
that
it
would
but
the
possibility
of
shutting
down
epa
and
tva
all
together
is
very,
very
remote.
we
would
be
going
after
penalties
in
terms
of
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
of
alabama
has
recently
filed
suit
against
the
tennessee
value
authority
for
exactly,
for
violating
the
emission
standards
under
the
their
implementation
plan.
in
that
case,
they
are
seeking
substantial
penalties
until
the
sources
brought
in
to
compliance.
mr.
david
d.
beals
it
is
not
just
the
purpose.
it
is
the
purpose
of
that
lawsuit
to
compel
tva
to
bring
their
source
into
compliance
with
the
air
pollution
control
requirements.
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
is
correct,
just
exactly
as
it
would
be
against
any
other
utility
company.
mr.
david
d.
beals
but
the
congress
did
not
contemplate
that
they
would
be
subject
only
to
the
substantive
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
at
least
that
--
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
as
it
comes
in,
they
are
not
subject
to
the
means
of
reaching
those
ends
that
every
other
public
utility
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
to
go
through.
they
have
to
come
in
with
a
compliance
schedule
which
is
approvable
by
the
state
which
will
get
them
to
that
point
other
than
to
just
say
that
three
years
from
now,
we
are
going
to
be
subject
to
these
things,
to
these
penalties,
so
we
are
going
to
meet
the
standards.
this
is
a
regulatory
statute.
we
plan
to
get
the
source
into
compliance.
it
is
not
a
question
of
saying
in
three
years;
you
are
going
to
have
to
be
responsible
to
meet
these
standards
i
hope
you
make
it.
that
is
not
what
the
state
does.
the
state
comes
in
and
they
plan
it.
they
see
to
it.
they
say
your
plan
is
not
adequate.
then
tva
says
we
will
do
this.
the
state
then
says
well
okay
that
is
fine.
mr.
david
d.
beals
in
1975,
a
month-and-a-half
before
the
attainment
dates,
the
federal
epa
was
trying
to
determine
the
compliance
status
of
federal
sources
and
to
get
them
to
enter
consent
agreements,
if
they
were
not
in
compliance,
consent
agreements
which
are
exactly
identical
in
every
respect
to
what
a
compliance
schedule
would
have
been.
mr.
david
d.
beals
that
is
correct.
the
fact
that
the
attainment
dates
and
in
addition
to
that
the
federal
administrator
is
talking
about
bringing
the
sources
into
compliances
expeditiously
as
practical.
we
were
talking
about
bringing
them
in
three
years.
we
were
talking
about
trying
to
arrange
it
so
that
they
would
be
in
compliance
at
the
end
of
a
three-year
period.
epa
apparently
is
still
not
talking
about
that.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
remaining
for
rebuttal.
