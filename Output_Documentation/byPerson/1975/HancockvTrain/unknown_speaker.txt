unknown
speaker
well,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
suggestion
why
not
wait
until
you
have
the
problem
and
then
go
in
on
the
enforcement
where
the
environmental
agency
raises
no
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
beals,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
provides
in
substance
that
if
a
point
source
is
in
compliance
with
the
standards,
emitting
the
wrong
kind
of
material
but
does
not
have
a
permit
that
it
is
in
violation
of
the
federal
statute,
does
the
federal
statute
require
a
permit
and
provide
that
the
failure
to
have
a
permit,
there
is
some
kind
of
remedy
for
that
even
though
there
is
compliance
with
the
substantive
standards.
unknown
speaker
that
is
purely
a
state
requirement,
the
permit
itself.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
state
technique
for
implementing
section
110.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
reason
i
asked,
i
was
wondering
what
would
happen
if
the
federal
point
source
were
in
compliance
with
the
substantive
standards
and
simply
refuse
to
get
a
permit.
what
federal
statutory
remedy
would
there
be
that
kentucky
could
assert
against
the
federal
point
source?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
there
really
have
been
–-
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
remedy
that
you
pursued
this
litigation
is
it
not?
that
is
the
remedy.
that
is
a
remedy.
that
is
the
reason
this
case
is
here.
you
began
a
lawsuit
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
remedy
to
enforce
your
permit
system,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
then
what
you
really
want
is
some
kind
of
reports
other
than
the
status
report?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
not
go
up
to
those
instead
of
going
out
with
permit?
unknown
speaker
or
you
just
want
to
show
up
with?
unknown
speaker
could
you
not
file
the
same
suit
to
require
them
to
file
these
reports?
unknown
speaker
mr.
beals,
let
us
just
go
down
the
road
away,
assume
that
you
prevail
in
this
lawsuit
and
the
federal
government
is
required
to
apply
for
a
permit
and
after
all
the
negotiations
and
all
of
the
good
faith
have
been
exhausted,
let
us
assume
the
appropriate
kentucky
authorities
conclude
that
the
--
let
us
take
fort
knox
is
not
in
compliance
with
the
standards.
what
do
you
then,
do
you
try
to
get
an
injunction
to
close
down
fort
knox?
unknown
speaker
what
section
of
the
act
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
allow
any
state
to
close
down
fort
knox?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
national
statute
we
are
talking
about.
consider
the
example
of
tennessee
valley
authority
which
operates
in
several
states
in
addition
to
kentucky,
it
is
at
tennessee
and
alabama,
perhaps
others.
if
kentucky
undertook
to
shutdown
a
part
of
tva,
of
the
tennessee
value
authority,
would
that
have
any
impact
on
its
operation
in
other
states?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
like
what
presumed.
what
i
am
asking
you
is
it
the
purpose
of
the
lawsuit
to
shutdown
the
entire
operation
of
the
tva?
unknown
speaker
that
is
quite
similarity,
as
it
would
be
against
any
utility
company?
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
congress
contemplated
that,
is
it
not?
when
it
said
that
the
federal
installation
should
be
subject
to
the
least
of
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
state
program?
unknown
speaker
but
congress
contemplated
at
least
that.
unknown
speaker
that
the
tva
and
fort
knox
would
be
subject
to
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
state
program?
unknown
speaker
and
so
far
as
you
know
is
epa
undertaking
any
parallel
monitoring
of
federal
facilities
to
see
that
they
come
into
compliance
with
the
state
requirement?
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
say
if
they
have
been
subjected
to
the
permit
program
you
would
have
had
those
on
in
72
and
not
75?
unknown
speaker
well,
everybody
agrees
with
that
mr.
friedman,
i
think
we
do
not
need
to
go
into
that.
the
question
of
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
section
118.
unknown
speaker
precisely!
unknown
speaker
but
if
does
not
have
that
effect
then
you
win.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
does,
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
he
concedes
what
in
this
agreement?
unknown
speaker
he
says
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
is
very
explicit
as
i
understood
it.
that
is
quite
a
lot
for
him
to
claim.
he
says
the
statute
on
its
face
covers
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
he
concedes
there
is
nothing
else
maybe?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
refers
to
substantive
requirements
either.
unknown
speaker
well
it
does
not
say
substantive.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
say
procedural.
unknown
speaker
so
which
one
would
you
like
to
leave
out?
unknown
speaker
well
which
one
would
you
think
that
would
be
included?
unknown
speaker
but
why?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
means
only
substantive
requirements
then
is
it
not
epa
under
a
duty
to
enforce
just
as
rigorously
against
the
federal
facilities,
the
state's
substantive
requirements
so
that
fort
knox
will
be
shutdown
if
it
does
not
comply?
the
only
question
is
whether
it
will
be
shutdown
by
the
kentucky
commission
or
by
the
epa.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
are
talking
about
a
good
deal
more
than
just
a
permit
requirement.
you
are
talking
about
the
remedies
that
may
be
imposed
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
substantive
standard?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
even
though
the
state
commission
dealing
with
says
the
kentucky
power
company.
if
it
were
doing
the
same
thing
could
order
the
facility
shut
down
if
it
have
not
complied
in
90
days.
the
epa
given
precisely
the
same
situation
with
respect
to
the
power
plant
at
fort
knox
can
say,
try
to
come
around
as
a
matter
of
committee
in
five
years.
unknown
speaker
this
is
before
us
now?
is
any
remedy
issue
before
us
now
or
is
it
only
the
application
question
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
the
–
you
have
that
escape
clause
--
unknown
speaker
and
i
would
suppose
the
president
can
interpret
it
and
make
a
finding
that
it
is
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states
--
unknown
speaker
to
keep
fort
knox
open.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
can
i
be
sure,
i
understand
your
position?
assume
a
facility
does
not
comply
with
the
substantive
requirements
forgetting
the
procedure
and
the
permits
for
the
moment
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
assume
the
president
has
not
made
an
exception,
would
you
not
agree
that
the
state
could
then
close
a
facility
down?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
and
would
the
lawsuit
not
have
merit?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
court
would
have
to
decide.
but
what
would
be
the
defense
be
to
such
a
suit?
unknown
speaker
if
you
assume
a
violation
of
the
substantive
requirement?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
have
any
question
that
we
have
to
comply
with
the
standards.
now,
what
does
the
legislative
history
show
about
what
congress
intended
in
section
118?
unknown
speaker
the
administrator
is
a
party
to
this
litigation,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
why
does
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
since
the
ordinary
party
does
not
have?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
say
it
is
a
fair
summary
of
the
legislative
history
to
say
that
it
does
not
indicate
that
anybody
actually
thought
of
the
precise
problem
that
this
case
would
have?
