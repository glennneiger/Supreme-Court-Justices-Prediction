mr.
beals,
do
you
envisage
situations
where
the
state
would
not
grant
a
federal
installation
of
permit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
would
stop
at
the
permit
stage
rather
than
later?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
are
zeroing
in
on
something
more
than
merely
identification
on
the
source
of
pollution?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
the
permit
stage?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
you
could
do
that
by
a
compulsion
suit
later,
could
you
not
after
the
permit
is
issued?
