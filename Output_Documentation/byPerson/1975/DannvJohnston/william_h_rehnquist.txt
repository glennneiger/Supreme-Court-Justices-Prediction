he
does
not
think
much
of
benson,
does
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
process
path?
justice
rehnquist
well,
certainly
mr.
shapiro,
that
is
far
beyond
the
holding
of
benson
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
require
more
technological
ability
than
i
posses
and
i
would
suspect
perhaps
than
you
posses
to
say
flatly
that
nothing
that
might
subsequently
be
done
with
a
computer
in
the
way
of
programming
could
ever
be
patented?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
you
probably
would
have
anticipated
the
telegraph
or
the
telephone
either
any
more
than
i
would
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
have
the
analog
computer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
there
you
do
not
have
it
just
for
an
instant,
you
have,
once
it
is
wired
i
take
it,
it
--
it
is
--
is
set
in
place
the
way
any
other
machine
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
digital,
basically
a
general
purpose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
you
can
say
that
about
a
record
player
too,
but
that
does
not
mean
you
get
a
patent
for
a
new
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
physical
machine
is
already
well
developed,
is
it
not,
and
then
perhaps
patented
it
separately?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
a
--
a
pro
the
fact
that
you
require
rely
on
a
program
should
not
make
it
unpatentable.
it
is
quite
another
to
say
that
the
program
itself
is
patentable,
which
is
really
what
you
are
saying
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
(voice
overlap)
in
the
taking
of
you
example
of
a
change
from
a
manual
choke
to
an
automatic
choke,
presumably
there
is
only
one
or
at
the
most
patents
that
are
available
on
---
on
that
kind
of
change,
but
if
your
theory
is
right,
there
is
a
patent
available
for
every
conceivable
configuration
of
this
computer
programming?
