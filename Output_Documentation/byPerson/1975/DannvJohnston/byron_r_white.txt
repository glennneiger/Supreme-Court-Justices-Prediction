justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
had
he
not
in
benson?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
(inaudible),
had
he
ever
expressed
how
it
was
held,
how
he
would
have
held
prior
to
benson
---
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
bring
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
is
the
board
or
the
board
is
--
he
may
not
challenge
the
board’s
--
the
board's
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
i
think
that
relates
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
machine
or
a
new
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
taking
issue
with
the
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
not
benson
after
the
board’s
decision
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
benson
bore
heavily
on
the
--
one
the
issues
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
you
say
that
you
should
at
least
have
a
chance
to
represent
your
arguments
to
the
board
of
--
to
the
board,
at
the
very
least?
justice
white
does
anyone
know
--
there
has
been
any
subsequent
cases
or
other
cases
that
you
know
what
the,
how
the
board
would
decide
its
case
after
benson?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
board
has
since
taken
a
position,
that
its
position
in
this
case
is
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
board
not
say
this
was
just
a
new
use,
it
is
a
new
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
it
said
it
was
a
new
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
not
patentable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
would
hold
any
--
as
any
general
purpose
computer
that
has
a
new
program
designed
for
it
to
be
a
new
machine,
i
--
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
not
hold
it
patentable
but
they
would
hold
it
to
be
a
new
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
required
to
follow
the
court
in
other
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
say
it
was
a
new
machine?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
rejected
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
rejected
it
for
some
other
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
[laughter]
time
is
short,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
--
if
a
holding
company,
if
a
conglomerate
had
a
lots
of
units
around
the
country
and
it
wanted
to
keep
track
of
it
--
of
the
--
of
the
bookkeeping
and
the
profits
of
the
various
units
and
it
used
this
very
machine
to
--
to
give
it
ready
information
about
the
operations
of
its
various
units,
would
that,
would
that
infringe
this
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
--
but
you
would
not
say
in
order
to
infringe
they
would
have
to
have
the
identical
circuitry?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
very
claims
of
generality
of
this
--
of
this
way
of
doing
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
not
just
claiming
something
like
a
copyright,
i
mean-
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
claiming
--
you
are
--
there
could
be
a
lot
of
machines
to
do
the
same
function,
but
differently
hooked
up
that
would
violate
your
patent?
