this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
the
respondent
developed
a
machine
system
for
automatic
record
keeping
of
bank
checks
and
deposits.
under
that,
the
system,
checks
and
deposits
are
labeled
by
the
customs
with
code
categories
which
are
read
and
then
processed
by
data
processes
such
as
programmable
electronic
digital
computer
having
data
storage
files
and
a
control
system.
the
system
allows
the
bank
to
furnish
customers
with
an
individualized
and
categorized
breakdown
of
their
transactions
with
appropriate
subtotals
for
the
periods
involved.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
held
the
respondent's
system
to
be
patentable,
be
reversed.
title
35
of
united
states
code
section
103
mandates
that
a
patent
not
be
given
when
the
differences
between
the
subject
matter
sought
to
be
patented
and
the
prior
art
are
such
that
the
subject
matter
as
a
whole
would
have
been
obvious
at
the
time
of
the
invention
was
made,
to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
to
which
said
subject
matter
pertains.
we
hold
that
under
this
standard,
respondent
system
was
obvious
and
hence
unpatentable.
