mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
respondent’s
invention
is
concerned
with
the
problem
of
meeting
the
needs
of
small
businessmen,
farmers
and
professionals
to
have
good
accurate,
reliable
financial
records
and
to
have,
where
possible,
the
benefit
of
large-scale
data
processing
systems
in
the
same
way
that
large
corporations
and
government
make
use
of
these
facilities.
one
solution
to
that
problem
of
providing
a
computer
is
to
do
the
same
thing
that
is
done
in
a
large
corporation
of
the
government
to
have
all
of
the
departments
or
users
conform
to
the
single
system,
a
single
algorithmic
procedure
that
the
computer
is
constructed
to
operate
on.
in
short,
if
all
of
these
small
users,
the
businessmen,
the
professionals,
the
farmers
would
all
keep
their
books
in
the
same
way,
then
that
solution
would
have
been
available.
respondent
said,
instead
of
having
all
the
users
adapt
to
the
machine,
let
us
construct
a
machine
which
will
adapt
to
the
users
and
so
he
provided
a
set
of
controls
for
a
computer,
so
that
any
ledger
format,
any
method
of
bookkeeping
could
be
used
by
a
user.
and
that
ledger
format
and
bookkeeping
procedure
of
each
user
would
be
established
in
the
circuits
of
the
machine,
in
the
master
circuits
as
we
called
them
in
the
patent
application,
and
a
general
set
of
controls
would
adapt
to
those
master
circuits
and
their
contents
and
operate,
so
that
each
individual's
format,
its
own
way
and
in
its
own
words
could
be
operated
on
by
the
machine,
each
individuals
own
method
of
bookkeeping
could
be
operated
on
and
what
is
more
interesting
because
of
this
adoptive
procedure,
each
time
a
user
wanted
to
change
his
procedure,
change
his
data,
change
his
records,
he
could
do
it
in
a
simple
fashion.
he
did
not
need
a
computer
programmer
or
anyone
else
to
restructure
the
machine.
he
could
communicate
directly
with
the
machine
by
reason
of
these
controls.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
yes
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
is
contemplated
by
use
of
the
program
that
--
that
this
machine
is
implemented
in,
that
precisely
those
benefits
would
be
derived.
i
spoke
primarily
of
--
of
business
users,
people
engaged
in
some
enterprise,
but
it
would
also
apply
to
personal
financial
record
keeping
as
well.
so
that
out
of
this
system
would
be
derived
the
possibility
that
people
can
go
their
own
way
and
still
get
the
benefits
of
the
reliability
of
the
digital
computer,
the
fast
speed
of
the
digital
computer,
to
keep
sound
records
for
tax
and
other
purposes
and
as
far
as
the,
as
far
as
these
benefits
are
concerned
they
are
once
of
in
effect
by
an
adaptive
machine
removing
the
impediment
of
having
to
deal
with
a
machine,
because
the
machine
adapts
to
the
user.
now,
this
is
not
a
method
of
bookkeeping
that
is
inside
the
machine.
it
is
not
an
accounting
algorithm
that
is
inside
the
machine.
it
is
a
machine
that
adapts
to
any
body’s
method
of
bookkeeping,
adapts
to
any
ledger
format
and
it
does
whatever
is
required
in
that
regard.
besides
the
software
programming
version
in
the
computer,
in
the
patent
application
for
the
computer
that
we
have
described,
we
also
indicate
that
the
control
mechanisms
can
also
be
implemented
by
what
is
called
hardware
programming.
the
description
is
in
terms
of
one
skilled
in
the
art
and
in
the
computer
art,
knows
the
circuits
of
the
computer
art,
would
understand
how
to
build
and
operate
the
circuit
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
requirements
of
section
112.
the
computer
expert
would
know
what
happens
in
those
circuits
and
would
know
how
to
build
a
machine
and
operate
it,
and
in
both
the
hardware
version
and
the
software
version.
if
we
had
a
demonstration
of
this
machine,
and
it
was
all
inside
the
machine
housing
so
we
couldn’t
look
in
there,
there
would
be
no
question,
it
would
be
a
machine,
because
it
would
perform
automatically.
it
would
need
all
the
definitions
of
a
machine,
a
devise
that
does
something
reasonably
complex
without
human
intervention,
automatically.
that
is
an
automatic
machine;
it
goes
beyond
the
definition
of
machine.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one
does
not
get
a
new
patent
on
a
new
record
because
there
is
no
technical
innovation
on
the
contents
of
the
record.
we
are
not
seeking
a
patent
on
a
record.
we
are
seeking
a
patent
on
a
machine
and
on
the
structure
of
the
machine.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
the
answer
to
your
question
is
a
complicated
one,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
give
you
an
answer.
this
diagram
is
an
attempt
at
a
lawyer’s
abstraction
of
all
that
we
need
to
know
of
how
a
computer
is
constructed
as
it
relates
to
the
issues,
the
legal
issues
in
this
case.
in
order
to
understand
how
a
special
purpose
computer
is
constructed,
we
have
to
understand
also
how
the
electrical
components
are
combined
to
produce
that
computer.
they
are
combined
in
the
fashion
of
using
conventional
computer
elements,
correction
electrical
components,
conventional
electrical
components,
resistors,
diodes,
transistors
and
connecting
to
those
resistors,
diodes
and
transistors
into
a
circuit
configuration,
the
circuit
configurations
that
we
illustrate
here
are
the
basic
circuit
configurations
used
in
a
computer.
they
are
and
circuits,
not
circuits
or
circuits,
they
are
called
logic
circuits.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
yes
sir.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
yes
sir.
it
appears
precisely
on
page
30.
it
is
just
a
blow-up
of
what
appears
there.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
commits
me
to
point
to
the
items
so
that
i
can
communicate
with
you.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
thank
you,
sir.
a
circuit
configuration
is
what
we
are
asking
for
in
the
way
of
patent.
the
configuration
of
the
circuit
elements,
as
defined
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
on
pages
14
and
15,
and
on
the
footnote
on
page
15
i
believe,
a
configuration
is
the
ordered
arrangement,
the
physical
location
and
arrangement
for
interrelationship
of
the
ports.
we
take
circuit
components
and
we
connect
them
in
a
configuration
and
that
is
done
--
and
that
is
done
at
the
logic
circuit
level.
these
same
logic
circuits
are
in
turn
connected
at
another
level
in
a
hierarchical
structure
of
this
complex
machine.
those
functional
circuits;
adder,
compare,
branch,
the
fetch
and
store,
the
basic
circuits
of
a
general
purpose
computer
are
configured
by
hardware
programs
using
as
the
basic
elements
the
and
or
and
not
logic
circuits.
at
the
level
of
the
special
purpose
computer,
these
same
functional
circuits
are
combined
in
a
new
circuit
configuration
and
that
circuit
configuration
is
also
a
program
in
the
same
way
that
the
programs
are
employed
to
build
the
functional
circuits.
so
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
are
building
a
circuit
configuration
that
claims
define
a
circuit
configuration.
they
define
a
circuit
configuration
whether
it
be
built
by
hardware
or
software
programming
and
as
i
indicated,
if
we
saw
this
machine
operating,
the
question
would
arise
from
the
patent
office,
not
is
this
machine
patentable
subject
matter
because
it
is
a
machine,
but
how
do
you
construct
it
with
hardware
programming
or
software
programming
and
that
question
is
a
simple
question.
it
is
how
do
you
electrically
interconnect
and
interrelate
the
circuit
elements?
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
that
is
the
difference
between
hardware
programming
and
software
programming,
a
mode
of
connection.
the
patent
office
says
--
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
we
are
talking
about
the
ibm
machine,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
the
ibm
machine
consists
of
electrical
components,
logic
circuits
and
functional
circuits
and
it
also
consists
of
another
device
called
a
“function
sequencer.”
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
what
we
put
in
there
in
addition
is
the
software
program
which
is
the
circuit
configuration.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
here
it
is
the
software
programs
which
are
stored
in
the
memory
states
of
a
computer.
up
to
this
point
we
have
what
are
called
unrelated
circuits,
the
functional
circuits.
if
we
think
for
a
moment
of
an
adder,
a
compare
circuit,
a
branch
circuit,
simple
fetch
and
store
circuits,
simple
little
things
like
that
and
combine
them
into
patterns
of
hundreds,
thousands,
even
millions
of
such
circuits,
extraordinary
things
take
place
that
computer
scientists
have
told
us.
you
can
restructure
those
circuits
by
that
combination
into
a
musical
synthesizer,
you
can
reconstruct
it
into
a
document
or
character
recognition
machine,
into
a
talking
computer.
into
a
computer
for
reading
electrical
meters,
a
computer
performing
calculations
on
a
readings
that
it
achieves,
a
computer
that
can
take
us
to
the
moon
and
all
of
those
different
things
are
done
with
these
four
little
circuits.
they
are
not
little
in
--
in
concept.
they
are
reasonably
sophisticated.
you
know,
they
could
fit
in
my
hand
in
modern
technology,
so
small
we
couldn’t
even
see
them
microscopically
in
the
most
modern
technology,
but
with
the
combinations
of
those
elementary,
unrelated
circuits,
the
extraordinary
technology
of
a
modern
computer
has
achieved.
the
configuration
of
those
circuits
is
the
same
thing
that
takes
place
at
the
elementary
level
of
forming
circuit
configurations,
which
have
always
been
patentable
since
sam
morse.
the
same
thing
in
the
way
of
a
circuit
configuration
that
takes
place
at
the
functional
circuit
level,
which
have
always
been
patentable
since
i
have
been
involved
in
this
technology
and
that
goes
back
some
decades.
the
fact
that
programs
are
used
to
construct
these
functional
circuits
is
no
detriment
to
patentability.
the
fact
that
programs
are
used
to
build
special
purpose
computers
is
no
detriment
to
patentability.
the
only
issue
is
how
do
you
connect
the
circuits.
as
my
colleague
indicated
before
lunch,
but
if
it
is
done
evanescently,
if
it
is
done
in
fractions
of
a
second
or
millionths
of
a
second
then
it
is
not
patentable.
if
it
is
done
slowly,
permanently,
like
taking
an
erector
set
and
riveting
the
pieces
together
permanently
that
would
be
patentable,
but
if
we
took
a
nut
and
bolt
and
put
the
pieces
together
and
then
took
the
pieces
apart
with
a
nut
and
bolt,
the
machine
we
built
with
that
later
technique,
that
would
be
evanescent,
it
could
not
be
patented
they
say.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
law
for
this
theory?
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
almost,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
almost,
but
let
me
clarify
what
the
word
program
is.
if
we
look
in
the
encyclopedia
britannica,
we
will
find
the
definition
of
the
word
program.
now,
interestingly
enough
it
does
not
appear
in
the
section
under
computers,
the
definition
does
not.
the
definition
appears
in
the
section
under
automation,
in
the
section
on
automatic
machines
and
in
the
encyclopedia
britannica,
they
say
a
program
tells
us
how
a
machine
will
function.
a
program
tells
the
machine
what
the
parts
will
do
and
how
they
will
work
together
to
produce
the
desired
result.
the
very
first
programs
that
we
know
of
took
place
some
hundreds
of
years
ago
in
the
time
when
the
patent
system
was
developed.
as
the
encyclopedia
reminds
us
and
that
is
a
program
for
operating
a
steam
engine,
so
that
a
man
does
not
have
to
stand
at
the
valves
and
open
them
and
close
them,
as
he
had
to
do
in
the
first
steam
engines,
even
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that.
what
they
did
with
the
program
was
to
replace
the
human
being
at
this
tedious
mental
and
physical
labor,
and
build
a
mechanism
for
interconnecting
the
parts.
so
that
as
the
piston
went
out,
one
thing
happen
with
the
valves,
when
the
piston
went
in
another
thing
happened
with
the
valves,
that
is
a
program.
a
program
is
when
we
take
a
manual
choke
and
replace
it
with
an
automatic
choke.
we
have
programmed
this
simple
device.
it
is
a
rather
elementary
kind
of
program,
but
it
is
a
program
nevertheless
and
in
modern
technology
where
the
computer
is
being
put
under
the
hood
of
our
automobiles
in
order
to
solve
the
problems
of
pollutants
and
alike,
the
programmed
digital
computer
is
now
being
used
as
we
explain
in
our
brief
and
as
amici
have
explained
in
their
brief
--
briefs,
to
build
these
mechanisms
under
the
computer,
the
control
mechanisms,
so
that
the
engine
will
operate
more
effectively.
in
fact,
they
are
patent,
excuse
me
--
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
i
would
say
yes
and
no
to
the
first
part
of
your
comment,
your
premise,
but
i
would
say
yes
to
the
last
part,
and
let
me
explain
that.
they
are
not
just
a
few
patents
to
automatic
chokes.
automatic
chokes
are
a
development
that
have
existed
for
long
time,
and
these
mechanisms
are
always
under
examination
and
ways
of
looking
--
ways
of
being
searched
for
to
improve
upon
them,
they
still
are
in
even
in
the
mechanical
and
electro-mechanical
sense.
in
the
second
part
of
your
question
let
me
say
this.
many,
many
computer
programs
are
being
written,
many
more
will
be
written.
most
of
them
use
the
state
of
the
art,
just
as
most
circuits
that
are
built
are
state
of
the
art.
perhaps
one
percent
of
the
circuits
that
are
built
that
are
available
to
us,
go
beyond
the
state
of
the
art
and
are
patentable
subject
matter.
as
far
as
computer
programs
are
concerned,
i
would
suspect
it
is
far
a
less
than
one
percent,
maybe
a
fraction
of
one
percent
of
patentable
subject
matter.
not
patentable
subject
matter,
correction,
are
patentable.
they
would
all
be
patentable
subject
matter
i
have
to
say
because
they
all
configure
a
circuit,
they
all
take
electrical
circuits
and
combine
them
into
new
sequences
and
combinations
and
relationships.
and
that
is
patentable
subject
matter
as
a
machine
and
the
important
part
for
us,
the
important
part
for
us
is
to
understand
the
import
of
all
of
this,
and
of
the
rule
that
is
being
requested
by
the
patent
office.
the
patent
office
says
computers
built
by
software
programming
are
not
patentable.
they
cite
a
case
which
on
the
same
theory
holds,
that
since
a
program
is
supposed
to
be
a
new
use
of
this
digital
computer,
it
does
not
infringe
a
patent
built
on
a
hardware,
on
the
same
type
of
computer
with
hardware
programming.
the
import
of
that
decision
is
that
one
can
take
any
hardware
patent
and
infringe
it
with
impunity,
it
would
not
be
an
unlawful
infringement,
by
programming
a
general
purpose
computer
to
perform
the
same
set
of
functions,
to
create
the
same
sequence
of
circuits.
that
is
what
that
decision
holds
and
what
we
have
as
result
in
the
way
of
an
absurdity,
we
have
as
a
result
that
you
cannot
get
patents
on
software
programming
and
any
hardware
programming
patents
you
get,
can
be
easily
infringed
by
software
programming.
as
a
consequence
the
patent
system
is
not
available
as
an
incentive
for
operating
in
a
computer
technology.
that
is
the
import
of
--
of
the
rule
suggested
by
the
patent
owners.
the
board
of
appeals
held
that
we
have
a
new
machine.
they
held
it
is
a
different
machine
from
the
general
purpose
computer
and
they
did
not
feel
constrained
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
ccpa,
when
it
comes
to
evaluating
this
technology.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
there
has
been
no
--
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
board
of
appeals'
position
in
this
regard.
there
has
been
one
case
which
was
published,
in
fact,
we
have
submitted
it
to
the
ccpa
over
opposition,
but
we
did
submit
it
to
the
ccpa
and
i
think
it
is
ultimately
a
part
of
the
total
record.
a
decision
of
the
board
of
appeals
and
that
board
of
appeals
did
not
change
its
position
on
new
machine,
different
machine,
or
new
use,
there
is
not
a
--
an
iota
of
change
of
the
court’s
position
in
that
regard.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
as
a
general
rule
it
does,
but
we
are
talking
basically
here
about
what
is
a
factual
issue.
what
happens
inside
of
this
box
with
the
circuits?
and
i
think
the
board
would
feel
a
large
sense
of
independence,
since
one
of
their
prerequisites
for
holding
office
in
35
u.s.c
section
7,
is
that
they
have
substantial
scientific
ability
and
i
believe
they
would
have
a
considerable
sense
of
independence
in
this
regard.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
that
was
their
holding
because
the
examiner
below
said
it
was
not
a
new
machine,
that
it
was
merely
a
new
use,
and
they
were
reversed
--
that
rejection
was
reversed.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
and
they
said
it
--
may
i
read?
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
yes.
they
said
since
--
they
said
that
there
was
a
premise
by
the
examiner
that
an
unprogrammed
or
a
definitely
programmed
general
purpose
computer
is
the
same
machine
as
the
one
that
would
result
from
appellants
programming
of
the
same
or
a
similar
computer.
since
neither
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
nor
this
board
considers
this
premise
to
be
valid,
each
of
the
rejections
advanced
by
the
examiner
is
not
sustained.
now,
there
was
another
issue
let
me
speak
to
it
at
this
point,
about
their
saying
later
on
about
different
machine.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
it
races,
mr.
justice
white.
they
say
they
are
simply
because
one
chooses
to
denominate
a
section
of
its
memory
by
a
term
descriptive
of
one
meaning,
such
as
a
file
of
stock
numbers
like
in
taking
inventory,
rather
than
the
file
of
sums
of
money
that
that
kind
of
difference
would
not
be
a
new
machine,
or
as
they
use
the
phrase
different
machine
and
we
have
no
disagreement
with
that.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
patent
because
we
have
applied
old
techniques
of
an
adoptive
machine
to
a
situation
in
which
it
is
now
going
to
be
used
for
financial
record
keeping.
as
to
the
issues
of
unobviousness,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
patent
office’s
briefs,
that
the
prior
art
can
achieve
the
same
result,
that
the
same
mechanisms
exist,
the
same
combination
of
control
mechanisms,
what
we
call
a
master
and
a
general
control
and
their
interrelationship
as
defined
in
the
claims
and
as
found
by
the
ccpa.
there
is
not
a
slightest
doubt
that
those
mechanisms
do
not
exist
in
the
prior
art.
mr.
chief
justice
markey
dealt
with
one
issue
and
that
is
category
codes.
we
do
not
seek
a
patent
on
category
codes
and
i
can
say
only
that
that
is
not
an
issue,
it
is
referred
to
in
the
claims,
but
that
provides
the
context
in
which
this
kind
of
machine
has
to
function
and
anybody
can
use
any
other
machine
to
work
with
category
codes,
to
perform
the
same
types
of
services,
the
same
type
of
use
of
--
of
general
purpose
computers
for
record
keeping
of
users
as
long
as
they
do
not
build
the
machine
that
we
have
which
is
adaptive
to
the
user
and
which
has
a
different
combination
of
controls.
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
--
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
yes
it
would
if
they
use
the
same
configuration
of
controls
that
which
infringed
this
patent,
but
they
would
have
no
reason
to
--
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
no,
our
claims
are
not
limited
to
any
particular
program,
software
or
hardware
and
not
limited
to
various
ways
of
--
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
we
are
--
we
are
claiming
the
generality
of
circuit
configurations
whereby
these
set
of
controls
is
achieved.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
no,
we
are
not.
mr.
morton
c.
jacobs
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
white.
as
far
as
the
issue
of
new
use
is
concerned,
let
me
make
one
comment.
new
use
means
you
compare
the
current
invention
with
the
prior
machine.
if
the
current
invention
is
the
same
structure
as
claimed
with
the
prior
machine,
then
it
is
a
new
use.
if
it
is
a
different
structure,
then
you
evaluate
that
structure
for
unobviousness
and
we
do
not
claim
the
same
structure
because
we
have
a
configuration
inside
of
that
machine
which
did
not
exist
there
before,
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
fundamental
issue.
new
use
when
it
was
written
into
the
1952
statute
was
for
purposes
of
extending
patentability
because
you
could
not
get
patents
before.
the
patent
office
is
arguing
here
that
it
ought
to
be
used
to
restrict
patentability,
not
to
extend
it.
a
point
is
raised
in
the
reply
brief
that
i
would
like
to
speak
to
just
quickly
and
that
is
with
regard
to
misuse
of
patents.
it
is
a
completely
misleading
and
erroneous
statement
to
say
that
the
law
is
such
that
a
staple
article
of
commerce
like
a
general
purpose
computer
could
be
tied
in
by
means
of
a
patent.
it
is
clearly
in
viol
--
it
would
be
clearly
in
violation
of
the
section
271
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
