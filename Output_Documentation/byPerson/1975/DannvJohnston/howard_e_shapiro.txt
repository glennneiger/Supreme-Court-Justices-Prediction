mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
three
years
ago
in
gottschalk
against
benson,
this
court
held
that
a
method
of
programming
a
general
purpose
digital
computer
to
convert
signals
from
one
form
of
binary
number
or
another
was
not
a
patentable
process
under
section
101
of
the
patent
code.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
held
that
a
computer
program
used
to
keep
records
of
financial
accounts
is
patentable
as
a
new
machine
rather
than
as
a
process,
even
though
the
application
in
our
view
claims
no
new
apparatus
and
the
program
is
carried
out
in
conventional
general
purpose
computers,
intentionally
designed
to
handle
such
programming.
the
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
under
section
1256
of
the
judicial
code.
the
issues
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
before
this
court,
are
whether
such
a
program
is
patentable
subject
matter
under
section
101
of
the
patent
code,
and
whether
use
of
computers
to
keep
track
of
financial
transactions
as
disclosed
in
the
specification
in
this
case,
is
obvious
from
the
prior
art.
now,
as
the
benson
case
explains
in
some
detail,
a
general
purpose
digital
computer
operates
by
performing
arithmetical
and
logical
operations
on
numbers.
now,
all
of
the
data
is
reduced
to
digits
represented
by
the
symbols
“1”
and
“0”
in
the
binary-number
system
and
these
numbers
can
be
made
physically
to
correspond
to
on
and
off
states
of
electronic
signals,
and
these
are
controlled
through
the
opening
and
closing
of
electronic
pathways
within
the
system.
it
is
a
sort
of
system
of
switching
among
circuits.
this
switching
process
is
accomplished
through
a
sequence
of
coded
instructions
called
the
program.
now,
to
create
a
program,
the
problem
to
be
resolved,
it
has
to
be
reduced
to
a
series
of
sequences
or
steps
expressed
in
a
language
which
the
computer
will
accept.
in
effect
therefore,
every
computer
program
requires
an
algorithm,
which
is
a
precise
and
complete
step-by-step
recipe
for
a
computational
procedure
because
computers
do
not
think,
the
algorithm
has
to
set
out
in
very
exacting
and
specific
rules,
and
it
has
to
be
expressible
in
a
programming
language.
the
computer
then
takes
the
expressed
language,
which
is
usually
in
a
higher
language,
you
go
through
several
steps
from
ordinary
human
thought
to
a
special
computer
language
as
to
language
that
is
close
to
what
the
machine
actually
uses
and
through
a
translator
device,
the
computer
converts
the
language
into
the
machine’s
code.
this
reduces
the
program
to
the
binary
number
system
of
on
and
off
states
and
then
the
computer
can
carry
out
the
arithmetic
and
logic
functions
by
which
it
operates.
now,
the
patent
application
in
this
case
discloses
a
computer
program
for
an
accounting
system.
the
system
permits
the
maintenance
of
individual
customer
accounts,
say
by
a
bank,
by
assigning
category
codes
to
checks
and
deposit
slips
that
are
marked
in
a
machine-readable
magnetic
ink.
the
categories
of
transactions
are
--
are
computed
as
totals,
and
they
are
reported
as
statements
to
the
customer
so
that
he
can
find
his
rent
expense
for
a
period
or
his
repair
expense
or
what
have
you.
the
specification
which
describes
the
steps
in
some
detail,
it
sets
out
flow
diagrams
for
the
programs
and
it
gives
as
an
example
of
a
specific
program,
a
program
for
use
in
an
ibm
1400
general
purpose
digital
computer.
the
--
the
accounting
aspects
are
shown
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
at
pages
72
and
83,
at
least
illustratively,
because
they
show
a
sample
check
with
the
category
code
and
a
transaction
journal
and
a
summary
statement.
i
think
the
--
a
precise
way
into
this
specification
which
is
long
and
detailed
would
be
to
glance
at
page
a7
of
the
appendix,
which
states
that
in
the
system
a
data
processing
--
a
data
processor
ega
store
program,
digital
computer
embodying
this
invention
is
employed.
the
program
may
assume
many
different
forms
that
are
well
known
in
the
art.
now,
that
is
essentially
all
that
this
specification
deals
with.
when
you
go
on
through
it,
you
do
not
find
any
description
of
“apparatus”
or
“circuitry”
of
any
--
or
devises
of
any
kind.
what
you
find
are
the
steps,
the
sequence
of
steps
to
be
carried
out
in
the
computer.
so
in
our
view,
this
specification
describes
a
system
of
records
and
procedures
for
carrying
out
accounting
in
a
general
purpose
digital
computer
system.
the
patent
claims
are
very
broadly
worded.
the
accounting
procedures
can
be
carried
out
in
existing
computers
long
in
use
and
no
new
machinery
is
necessary.
now,
the
patent
examiner
in
this
case
rejected
the
application
under
section
112
of
the
ground
that
it
was
indefinite
and
inadequately
disclosed,
and
under
section
102
on
the
ground
that
prior
patents
anticipated
these
inventions.
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
patent
office
board
of
appeals.
now,
the
board
at
this
time
was
constrained
by
decisions
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
particularly
ingrid
bernhard
(ph)
and
its
progeny,
which
hold
that
each
program
for
a
general
purpose
computer
makes
the
computer
into
a
different
machine
and
that,
therefore,
if
it
is
a
new
program
it
becomes
a
new
machine.
the
logic
of
this
is
said
to
be
that
electronically
the
program
sets
up
a
different
set
of
circuits,
and
therefore,
it
is
structurally,
at
least
for
the
few
millions
of
a
second
that
the
program
and
the
circuits
are
in
existence
in
the
machine.
this
court’s
decision
in
benson
had
not
come
down
at
this
time,
when
the
matter
was
before
the
board
of
patent
appeals.
nevertheless
the
board
of
patent
appeals,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
held
that
the
patent
application
was
not
patentable
subject
matter
within
section
101
of
the
patent
code.
it
said
that
the
claims
did
not
enhance
the
internal
functioning
of
a
computer,
but
were
merely
a
process
for
using
it,
using
that
computer
for
purposes
outside
the
technological
arts;
this
was
an
attempt
to
accommodate
ccpa
decisions
as
they
then
stood.
it
expressly
held
that
a
computer
operating
with
any
given
stored
program
is
not
a
different
machine
simply
because
somebody
decides
to
assign
to
its
memory
a
particular
human
meaning
and
the
board
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
difference
between
the
apparatus
claims
which
were
in
this
patent
and
the
machine
claims
they
really
had
to
stand
or
fall
together,
and
then
finally
the
board
held
that
the
claims
were
obvious
in
the
light
of
prior
art
because
it
has
said
that
banks
have
long
been
using
magnetic
ink
machine-readable
category
codes,
and
also
that
the
system
fell
within
the
disclosure
of
apportion
of
another
patent
previously
issued,
the
derk’s
(ph)
patent.
the
respondent
challenged
the
board
of
appeals
decision
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
on
every
ground.
now,
while
the
appeal
was
pending,
this
court’s
decision
in
benson
came
down
and
then
the
respondent
abandoned
his
process
claims,
living
only
the
machine
claims.
the
commissioner
argued
in
the
court
below
that
benson
applied
both
to
the
machine
and
the
patent
claims,
and
that
the
computer
programs
were
unpatentable
under
section
101.
the
respondent
argued,
referring
particularly
to
the
ccpa’s
earlier
decisions
that
a
computer
program
is
a
physical
structure,
that
machine
claims
are
patentable
under
benson,
that
benson
has
not
affected
the
rule
in
the
ccpa.
that
an
unprogrammed
general
purpose
computer
is
a
different
machine
and
--
in
effect
he
said
that
benson
was
confined
to
machine
claim
--
was
confined
to
process
claims.
the
court
below
held
again
that
that
record-keeping
machine
systems,
which
comprise
programmed
general
computers,
digital
computers,
are
statutory
subject
matter
and
they
could
be
patented
if
they
were
not
obvious
in
the
line
of
prior
art.
again
it
reaffirmed
its
decision
in
the
bernhardt
case.
it
held
that
benson
was
inapplicable,
because
benson
dealt
with
a
process
claim
and
these
were
drafted
in
the
form
of
machine
claims
and
of
course
it
rejected
the
holding
of
obviousness
from
the
prior
art.
judge
markey
(ph)
dissented,
concluding
that
the
disclosure
was
obvious,
and
then
judge
rich
(ph)
wrote
a
very
interesting
decent
in
which
he
analyzed
benson
and
concluded
that
there
is
just
no
difference
between
machine
claims
and
structure
claims
in
this
context,
that
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
the
patent
draftsman's
art
and
that
meant
the
thrust
of
benson
clearly
indicates
that
computer
programs
are
not
patentable.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
he
does
not.
he
disagrees.
he
adheres
to
the
ccpa
analysis
which
is
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
he
had
written
benson,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
he
was,
yes.
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
believe
he
joined
the
decision
in
bernhardt
and
a
decision
subsequent
to
benson
which
were
decided
on
records
completed
before
the
benson
case,
which
continued
to
adhere
to
the
ccpa’s
bernhardt
rule.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
there
is
an
argument
that
the
commissioner
is
--
is
barred
jurisdictionally
from
contesting
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
it
is
really
whether
the
bernhardt
rule
can
be
challenged
in
this
proceeding
because
of
the
way
in
which
it
came
up.
we
think
it
clearly
can
be
for
the
reasons
i
recited
in
listing
the
board
of
appeals'
rejection.
the
board
of
appeals
restrained
by
bernhardt
at
this
time,
and
as
the
court
to
which
its
decisions
of
the
board
have--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened
in
benson,
the
issue
came
before
the
ccpa.
the
rejection
was
under
section
101
by
the
board,
and
the
issue
before
the
ccpa
in
part
concerned,
what
does
benson
do
to
the
general
doctrine
of
bernhardt.
the
ccpa
held
as
it
had
to
one
way
or
another
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
at
the
very
least,
your
honor.
this
court’s
jurisdiction
after
all
is
under
section
1256
of
the
code,
it
is
broad
certiorari
jurisdiction,
just
as
broad
as
if
this
case
came
up
from
the
district
court
under
section
145,
and
then
through
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
under
section
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
since
benson,
the
--
the
board
i
think
is
taking
position
that
benson
is
controlling
as
the
commissioner
argued
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
would
have
to
--
well,
its
decision
in
this
case
was
a
rejection
of
the
applications
under
101.
a
step
in
its
reasoning,
a
step
in
its
reasoning
is
no
longer
valid,
that
is
right
because
of
benson
which
made
clear
that
these
computer
programs
are
not
patentable.
well,
i
turn
to
the
merits
then.
if
we
look
at
the
specification,
we
can
see
that
what
we
have
got
here
is
nothing
more
than
an
accounting
system
carried
out
in
a
computer.
now,
as
an
accounting
system,
the
disclosure
is
unpatentable
because
a
method
of
transacting
business
is
an
abstract
concept
without
a
physical
embodiment;
an
abstract
concepts
and
laws
of
nature
and
mental
process
are
not
patentable
and
certainly
business
methods
are
not
patentable.
when
you
take
a
business
method
or
an
accounting
system
and
you
embody
it
as
a
sequence
of
steps
for
using
a
general
purpose
computer,
it
is
also
unpatentable
subject
matter.
now,
benson
clearly
holds
that
a
mathematical
formula
is
not
patentable.
it
then
goes
on
to
hold
that
such
an
abstract
concept
does
not
become
patentable
when
it
is
expressed
as
an
algorithm
for
a
computer
program.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
a
process,
but
the
thrust
of
benson
is
that
abstract
concepts
like
accounting
systems
are
also
unpatentable
when
expressed
as
computer
programs.
if
you
--
if
you
call
the
machine
you
do
not
really
change
anything,
as
judge
rich
pointed
out,
all
that
is
happening,
when
you
say
it
is
a
process
or
a
machine
is
--
is
that
you
are
taking
the
same
sequence
of
steps
and
then
saying,
well,
we
will
call
it
a
machine
because
it
operates
in
the
computer
--
it
is
the
same
way
as
if
we
call
it
a
process.
the
--
in
fact
i
think
that
since
all
computer
programs
are
algorithms,
are
series
of
steps,
sequences
of
steps,
none
can
be
patentable
under
benson
as
either
machines
are
process,
and
this
is
the
thrust
of
judge
rich's
analysis.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
have
--
we
have
tried
to
reserve
the
possibility
which
we
have
no
technological
force
as
you
recognized
that
there
maybe
some
sort
of
combination
or
use
of
program
and
computer
that
--
that
operates
in
some
synergistic
way.
i
cannot
anticipate
what
it
is,
i
am
not
an
inventor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
which
is
why,
which
is
precisely
why
in
using
those
cases,
the
court’s
decisions
involving
those
inventions,
the
telegraph
and
the
--
the
telephone,
have
always
been
limited
in
such
a
way
that
the
results
achieved
as
distinguished
from
the
machinery
themselves
cannot
be
patented
and
what
is
happening
here
in
this
case
is
that
the
--
the
simple
idea
of
using
a
general
purpose
computer
to
carry
out
an
accounting
program,
without
being
embodied
or
limited
to
any
particular
apparatus,
is
getting
--
is
being
patented
and
that
is
part
of
the
objectionable
aspect
of
this
--
this
--
of
this
application.
the
grant
of
the
patent
in
effect
is
a
grant
of
a
monopoly
on
the
general
idea
of
providing
individual
financial
record
keeping
by
computer.
we
think
that
at
most
the
disclosure
involves
a
new
use
of
an
old
machine
and
even
that
i
think
i
would
have
to
qualify
the
new
use,
but
when
you
claim
it
is
a
machine,
you
run
into
the
--
the
long-standing
rule
that
you
cannot
get
a
machine
patent
on
a
new
use
of
that
machine.
and
that
is
clear
in
the
patent
law,
and
congress
made
it
doubly
clear
in
1952
when
it
added
to
the
patent
code
the
definition
of
process,
which
says
that
a
process
is
a
new
use
of
an
old
machine.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
board
did
not
say
it
is
a
new
machine.
it
simply
--
it
simply
--
in
fact
it
claimed
to
the
contrary
that
there
was
no
structural
change
by
the
nature
of
this
fact.
all
it
did
was
reject
a
premise
that
the
examiner
had
relied
on
which
was
at
that
--
it
was
inconsistent
with
bernhardt.
the
board
tried
to
accept
bernhardt
and
then
come
back
in
the
back
door
with
the
way
around
it.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
they
said
it
was
not
patentable
because
it
found
no
structural
change,
no
enhancement
of
a
function
of
the
machine,
those
were
his
words,
enhancement
of
the
function
of
the
machine.
so
they
did
not
concede
that
this
was
a
new
machine.
now,
we
get
to
this
question
of
is
it
a
new
machine
or
is
it
not
and
you
really
have
to
think
about
what
--
what
computers
are
and
what
they
do.
the
bernhardt
case
says
that
every
general
purpose
computer
becomes
a
special
purpose
computer
when
you
put
in
a
new
program
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
electronic
circuitry
changes,
but
this
machine
only
exists
in
fractions
of
a
second
while
the
program
is
going
on,
and
as
soon
as
the
sequence
is
completed
the
new
machine
is
gone
until
the
program
is
put
back
in
again.
now,
this
evanescence
electronic
condition
just
is
not
a
new
machine
under
section
101.
the
only
machine
involved
is
the
existing
general
purpose
computer.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
the
argument
would
be
the
same,
although
we
do
not
have
an
analog
computer
here
and
the
technology
is
somewhat
different.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
with
this
difference
i
do
not
fully
--
this
record
that
has
not
told
us
enough
about
the
--
the
operation
of
what
are
called
general
purpose
analogs,
and
i
really
cannot
describe
them
for
you,
but
i
think
as
in
benson
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
issue
of
analog
computers
is
not
before
us
here,
but
with
--
at
least
with
the
general
purpose
computer,
about
which
we
can
talk
with
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
this
calls
for
a
--
a
general
purpose
digital
computer.
now,
these
machines,
i
mean,
digital
general
purpose
computers
are
frequently
multi-programmed.
so
that
you
have,
may
be
operated
on
time-sharing
basis,
and
almost
simultaneously
they
have
data
from
all
kinds
of
sources
and
programs
coning
in,
and
they
are
able
to
sort
it
out
and
operate
almost
instantaneously
on
a
large
number
of
them.
now,
to
say
that
this
single
general
purpose
computer
is
as
many
different
machines,
for
legal
purposes,
as
--
as
there
are
programs
in
it,
is
really
the
step
into
the
area
of
legal
fiction,
which
is
what
judge
rich
candidly
recognized
we
were
dealing
with.
the
various
configurations
of
circuitry
or
electronic
pathways
are
no
more
new
machines
than
would
be
switching
configurations
in
a
railroad
yards
that
is
constantly
changing
or
the
--
or
the
different
circuit
patterns
that
appear
in
electric
sign
that
flashes
the
news;
you
change
those
circuit
patterns
to
light
up
the
bulbs,
it
is
all
it
is,
but
it
is
one
machine.
when
we
get
down
to
--
it
does
not
make
a
difference
between
process
claims
and
machine
claims.
as
i
have
said
that
is
a
matter
of
the
draftsman
art
and
finally
there
is
an
argument
made
that
the
general
purpose
computer
will
achieve
the
same
results
as
a
hardwire
special
purpose
computer,
so
it
must
be
a
new
machine.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
--
that
a
special
purpose
machine
can
accomplish
the
same
results
as
a
programmed
general
purpose
device,
but
equivalence
of
results
is
not
equivalence
of
means.
it
is
well
established
that
the
results
that
a
machine
achieves,
the
function
of
the
machine,
to
use
the
old
language
from
corning
against
burden,
is
not
patentable
as
a
machine.
the
special
purpose
machine
has
a
physical
structure.
the
program
is
only
a
sequence
of
steps
carried
out
in
a
machine
with
a
different
structure.
now,
this
is
what
led
to
the
digitronics
decision
which
we
have
described
in
our
reply
brief.
there
is
an
argument
made
that
the,
there
would
be
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
to
grant
a
patent
on
a
hardwire
machine,
but
not
on
a
program
general
purpose
machine
or
rather
to
put
more
truthfully
on
the
program
itself,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
up
to
congress,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
benson,
to
decide
how
far
it
will
go.
in
deepsouth
against
latrum
(ph),
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
scope
of
the
patent
clause
is
for
congress
to
implement,
and
that
is
what
really
takes
care
of
the
equal
protection
argument
in
nash
(ph).
now,
finally
there
is
a,
i
mean,
really
what
this
sounds
in
--
is
the
problem
of
--
of
technology
overtaking
existing
law.
we
faced
this
in
the
catv
area
now
and
the
court’s
decisions
have
reflected
that
and
in
recently
i
think
in
the
radio
music
case,
20th
century
music
corporation
against
aiken,
where
the
technology
just
does
not
fit
the
existing
law.
congress
was
called
on
to
do
something
about
this
in
benson,
it
has
not
acted
on
computer
programming
yet,
we
do
not
know
whether
it
will.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
should
like
--
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
briefly.
first
i
note
that
in
respondents’
analysis,
he
has
not
pointed
to
anything
in
the
language
of
its
application,
which
expressly
describes
a
circuit
configuration.
those
words
do
not
appear.
no
drawing
appears
showing
any
particular
circuit
configuration
of
any
kind.
what
is
described
is
a
sequence
of
steps
that
can
be
carried
out
in
a
computer.
the
reference
has
been
made
to
a
hardwire
version,
and
the
phrase
special
computer
use.
the
respondent
himself,
in
his
application
at
a66,
drew
the
distinction
between
a
general
purpose
computer
which
is
programmed
and
a
hardwire
version,
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
application
that
would
tell
anyone
how
to
build
a
hardwire
version
there
has
been
a
discussion
of
the
meaning
of
the
claims.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
to
the
petition
at
page
37a,
one
can
see
the
way
that
any
claim
for
a
process,
involving
a
computer
program
can
be
simply
revised
by
a
few
words
to
be
a
machine
claim.
it
is
literally
a
matter
of
substituting
the
word
machine
and
substituting
the
word
means,
but
that
has
to
be
backed
by
some
sort
of
structure
description
in
the
specification
and
that
just
is
not
here.
it
has
been
stated
that
the
program
--
the
application
is
not
limited
to
any
particular
program,
so
that
what
is
claimed
is
the
general
right
to
use
computers
for
this
particular
kind
of
accounting.
a
word
on
the
obviousness
question
which
we
have
submitted
on
our
briefs,
obviousness
does
not
require
the
same
mechanisms
to
be
in
existence.
obviousness
is
the
gap
between
what
exits
and
what
someone
skilled
in
the
art
could
bring
into
existence.
the
same
mechanism's
issue
is
a
matter
of
anticipation
by
prior
patents,
and
that
is
not
before
the
court,
that
arises
under
section
102,
the
obviousness
issue
under
section
103.
judge
markey,
in
his
dissent
on
obviousness
was
quite
specific.
he
said
that
one
skilled
in
the
art
presented
with
a
conventional
machine
system
would
have
found
that
obvious
without
knowledge
of
appellant's
disclosure
to
have
modified
the
system,
as
set
forth
in
the
appealed
claims.
he
was
not
just
confining
himself
to
category
codes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
