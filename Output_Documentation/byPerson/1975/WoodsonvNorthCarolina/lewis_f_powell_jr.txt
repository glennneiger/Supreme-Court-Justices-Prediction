so
if
the
some
fanatic
set
off
a
hydrogen
bomb,
said
destroyed
new
york
city.
do
you
still,
you
think
they
think
the
appropriate
remedy
for
that
would
be
that
to
put
him
in
prison
to
have
set
it
on
parole
in
seven
years?
justice

for

before

mr.
amsterdam
may
i
give
you
at
least
to
have
a
half
a
minute.
i
would
like
to
ask
this
question
and
i
am
sure
you
feel
that
each
of
these
five
statutes
is
apparent
and
unconstitutional
in
the
views
that
you
have
expressed.
well
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
someone,
somewhere
had
to
choose
among
the
five,
which,
of
that
five
in
your
judgment,
since
you
have
studied
them
all,
would
be
most
likely
to
minimize
the
elements
of
discretion
and
arbitrariness
that
are
so
offensive
to
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
you,
you
have
no
choice
among
the
five
statutes?
