justice

the
next
case
to
announce
this
morning,
the
fourth
case
is
75-5491,
james
tyrone
woodson
and
luby
waxton
petitioners
against
the
state
north
carolina,
respondent,
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence
for
the
crime
of
first-degree
murder
under
the
law
of
north
carolina
violates
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
the
petitioners
were
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
and
mandatorily
sentenced
to
death
as
the
result
of
their
participation
in
an
armed
robbery
of
a
convenience
food
store,
in
the
course
of
which
the
cashier
was
killed.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
affirmed
the
judgments
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
the
claim
that
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentences
in
this
case
amount
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
petitioner's
first
and
most
basic
argument
is
that
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
under
any
circumstances
at
any
time
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
we
reject
this
argument
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
opinions
that
have
just
been
announced.
at
the
time
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
furman
case
furman
against
georgia
in
1972,
north
carolina
law
provided
that,
in
cases
of
first-degree
murder,
the
jury,
in
its
unbridled
discretion,
could
choose
whether
the
convicted
defendant
should
be
sentenced
to
death
or
to
life
imprisonment.
after
the
furman
decision,
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
held
unconstitutional
the
provision
of
the
death
penalty
statute
that
gave
the
jury
that
option,
but
the
state
supreme
court
held
further
that
this
provision
was
severable
so
that
the
statute
survived
as
a
mandatory
death
penalty
law.
the
north
carolina
general
assembly,
two
years
later
in
1974,
followed
the
court's
lead
and
enacted
a
new
statute
that
was
essentially
unchanged
from
the
old
one,
except
that
it
made
the
death
penalty
mandatory.
it
was
under
this
statute
that
the
petitioners,
who
committed
their
crime
on
june
3,
1974,
were
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
death.
north
carolina,
unlike
florida,
georgia,
and
texas,
has
thus
responded
to
the
furman
decision
by
making
death
the
mandatory
sentence
for
all
persons
convicted
of
first-degree
murder.
in
ruling
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
sentences
imposed
on
the
petitioners
under
this
north
carolina
statute,
the
court
now
addresses
for
the
first
time,
the
question
whether
a
death
sentence
returned
pursuant
to
a
law
imposing
a
mandatory
death
penalty
for
a
broad
category
of
homicidal
offenses,
constitutes
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
it
is
settled
that
the
eighth
amendment
stands
to
assure
that
state's
power
to
punish
is
"exercised
within
the
limits
of
civilized
standards."
central
to
the
application
of
the
amendment,
therefore,
is
a
determination
of
contemporary
standards
regarding
the
infliction
of
punishment.
at
the
time
the
eighth
amendment
was
adopted
in
1791,
the
states
uniformly
followed
the
common
law
practice
of
making
death
the
exclusive
and
mandatory
sentence
for
certain
specified
offenses.
although,
the
range
of
capital
offenses
in
the
american
colonies
was
quite
limited
in
comparison
to
the
more
than
200
offenses
then
punishable
by
death
in
england,
the
colonies
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
imposed
death
sentences
on
all
persons
convicted
of
any
of
a
considerable
number
of
crimes,
typically
including
at
a
minimum,
murder,
treason,
piracy,
arson,
rape,
robbery,
burglary,
and
sodomy.
but
almost
from
the
outset,
jurors
reacted
unfavorably
to
the
harshness
of
mandatory
death
sentences.
the
states
initially
responded
to
this
expression
of
public
dissatisfaction
with
mandatory
statutes
by
limiting
the
classes
of
capital
offenses.
this
reform,
however,
left
unresolved
the
problem
posed
by
the
not
infrequent
refusal
of
jurors
to
convict
even
murderers
rather
than
to
subject
them
to
automatic
death
sentences.
in
1794,
pennsylvania
attempted
to
alleviate
the
undue
severity
of
the
law
by
confining
the
mandatory
death
penalty
to
"murder
of
the
first
degree"
and
within
a
generation
that
practice
spread
to
most
of
the
states.
but
juries
continued
to
find
the
death
penalty
inappropriate
in
a
significant
number
of
first-degree
murder
cases,
and
refused
to
return
guilty
verdicts
for
that
crime.
the
inadequacy
of
distinguishing
between
murderers
solely
on
the
basis
of
legislative
criteria
soon
led
the
states
to
grant
juries
sentencing
discretion
in
capital
cases.
tennessee,
in
1838,
followed
by
alabama,
in
1841,
and
louisiana,
in
1846,
were
the
first
states
to
abandon
mandatory
death
sentences
even
for
first-degree
of
murder,
in
favor
of
discretionary
death
penalty
statutes.
by
the
turn
of
this
century,
23
states
and
the
federal
government
had
made
death
sentences
discretionary
for
first-degree
murder.
and
during
the
next
two
decades,
14
additional
states
replaced
their
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes.
by
1963,
all
of
the
remaining
jurisdictions
had
replaced
their
automatic
death
penalty
statutes
with
discretionary
jury
sentencing.
the
history
of
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes
in
the
united
states
thus
reveals
that
the
practice
of
sentencing
to
death
all
persons
convicted
of
a
particular
offense,
even
first-degree
of
murder,
had
been
totally
rejected
years
before
the
furman
case
was
decided
in
this
court.
the
two
crucial
indicators
of
evolving
standards
of
decency
respecting
the
imposition
of
punishment
in
our
society,
jury
determinations
and
legislative
enactments,
both
therefore
point
conclusively
to
the
repudiation
in
our
country
of
mandatory
death
sentences.
although
this
court
has
never
ruled
on
the
constitutionality
of
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes,
it
has
on
several
occasions,
dating
back
to
1899,
in
the
case
of
winston
against
united
states,
it
has
commented
upon
our
society's
aversion
to
mandatory
sentence
of
death.
fifty
years
after
winston
case,
the
court
underscored
the
marked
transformation
in
our
attitudes
toward
mandatory
sentences
and
i
quote
from
the
case
of
williams
against
new
york,
"the
belief
no
longer
prevails
that
every
offense
in
a
like
legal
category
calls
for
an
identical
punishment
without
regard
to
the
past
life
and
habits
of
a
particular
offender.
this
whole
country
has
traveled
far
from
the
period
in
which
the
death
sentence
was
an
automatic
and
commonplace
result
of
convictions.”
more
recently,
in
the
case
of
mcgautha
against
california,
the
court
spoke
of
the
american
"rebellion
against
the
common
law
rule
imposing
a
mandatory
death
sentence
on
all
convicted
murderers."
so
it
was
that
four
years
ago
in
the
furman
case,
the
chief
justice
speaking
for
the
dissenters
in
that's
case,
was
able
to
say
with
total
accuracy
and
i
am
quoting,
“i
had
thought
that
nothing
was
clearer
in
history,
then
the
american
abhorrence
of
'the
common
law
rule
imposing
a
mandatory
death
sentence
on
all
convicted
murderers.”
we
conclude
that
north
carolina's
mandatory
death
penalty
statute
for
first-degree
murder,
conspicuously
departs
from
contemporary
standards
respecting
imposition
of
punishment
of
death
and
thus
cannot
be
applied
consistently
with
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
a
separate
and
perhaps
somewhat
inconsistent
deficiency
of
north
carolina's
mandatory
death
sentence
statute
is
its
failure
to
provide
a
constitutionally
tolerable
response
to
furman's
rejection
of
unbridled
jury
discretion
in
the
imposition
of
capital
sentences.
it
is
argued
that
north
carolina
has
remedied
the
inadequacies
of
the
death
penalty
statutes
held
unconstitutional
in
the
furman
case
by
withdrawing
all
sentencing
discretion
from
juries
in
capital
cases.
but
when
one
considers
the
long
and
consistent
american
experience
with
the
death
penalty
in
first-degree
murder
cases,
it
becomes
evident
that
mandatory
statutes
enacted
in
response
to
furman
have
simply
papered
over
the
problem
of
unguided
and
unchecked
and
unreviewable
jury
discretion.
a
third
and
final
constitutional
shortcoming
of
the
north
carolina
statute
is
its
failure
to
allow
the
particularized
consideration
of
relevant
aspects
of
the
character
and
record
of
each
convicted
defendant
before
the
imposition
upon
him
of
a
sentence
of
death.
a
process
that
accords
no
significance
to
relevant
facets
of
the
character
and
record
of
the
individual
offender
or
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
offense,
excludes
from
consideration
in
fixing
the
ultimate
punishment
of
death,
the
possibility
of
compassionate
or
mitigating
factors
stemming
from
the
diverse
frailties
of
humankind.
it
treats
all
persons
convicted
of
a
designated
offense
not
as
uniquely
individual
human
beings,
but
as
members
of
a
faceless,
undifferentiated
mass
to
be
subjected
to
the
blind
infliction
of
the
penalty
of
death.
while
the
prevailing
practice
of
individualizing
sentencing
determinations
generally
reflects
simply
enlightened
policy,
rather
than
a
constitutional
imperative,
we
believe
and
when
i
say
we
i
mean
mr.
justice
powell,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
believe
that
in
a
capital
case,
the
fundamental
respect
for
humanity
underlying
the
eighth
amendment,
requires
consideration
of
the
character
and
record
of
the
individual
offender
and
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
offense
as
a
constitutionally
indispensable
part
of
the
process
of
inflicting
the
death
penalty.
this
conclusion
rests
squarely
on
the
proposition
that
the
penalty
of
death
is
qualitatively
different
from
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
however
long.
for
the
reasons
i
have
summarized,
we
conclude
that
the
death
sentences
imposed
upon
the
petitioners
under
north
carolina's
mandatory
death
sentence
statute
violated
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
and
therefore
must
be
set
aside.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
reversed
insofar
as
it
upheld
the
death
sentences
imposed
upon
the
petitioners,
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
that
mr.
justice
powell,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
have
filed,
with
the
clerk
today.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
filed
statements,
concurring
in
this
judgment.
