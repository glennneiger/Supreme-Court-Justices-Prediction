unknown
speaker
what
about
the
motion
for
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
but
what
about
in
the
trial
court
on
the
motion
for
new
trials.
unknown
speaker
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
you
got-
unknown
speaker
well
i
say
again
as
i
said
yesterday,
has
not
your
furman
result
prompted
this
kind
of
thing
of
which
you
are
now
so
seriously
complaining.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
said
that
in
my
dissent,
so
you
do
not
have
to
argue
with
me
about
it.
unknown
speaker
it
would
conceive
that
the
jury
system
does
work
irrationally
sometimes
in
criminal
cases
as
[voice
overlap]
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)now
to
your
argument
that
death
is
different.
this
is
where
you
must
end
up.
as
yesterday,
when
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you
the
question
and
your
answer
has
to
be
that
death
is
different
and
if
it
is
not
different
you
have
to
lose.
unknown
speaker
i
sense
you.
unknown
speaker
i
say
if
one
wanted
be
to
argue
retribution,
one
could
say
that
the
victims
whom
you
never
mention
have
already
lost.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
missed
my
point,
i
mentioned
victims
of
the
four
defendants.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
getting
back
to
the
discussion
you
were
just
having
with
mr.
justice
blackmun.
you
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
one
person
who
has
committed
murder
may
receive
capital
punishment
while
8
or
10
or
20
escape
it,
let
me
ask
you
a
better
federal
statute
that
imposes
a
death
penalty
only
for
air
piracy
that
results
in
death
and
that
death
on
the
747
could
be
350
people.
it
does
not
appear
very
often
fortunately,
you
would
not
have
the
same
argument
their,
because
they
would
not
be
a
peter,
paul,
john,
james,
and
henry
and
these
other
people
you
have
been
talking
about,
there
might
be
a
half
a
dozen
in
course
of
year
who
committed
air
piracy.
would
you
make
the
same
arguments
against
the
federal
statute
that
you
do
against
the
north
carolina
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
amsterdam,
just
so
i
am
clear;
you
are
really
reverting
back
to
your
first
argument
now.
unknown
speaker
but
your
response
really
is
in
the
context.
but
basically
in
the
context
that
you
first
tried,
am
i
not
correct
in
understanding
your
second
argument
that
you
really
make
the
same
argument
regardless
of
what
the
statutory
procedure
is
and
regardless
of
whether
it
applies
to
one
person
or
thousand.
unknown
speaker
so
that
your
second
argument
has
the
same
force
against
the
air
piracy
example
of
mr.
justice
powell
but
as
it
does
against
--
unknown
speaker
absolutely.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on
let
me
pursue
that
just
a
step
further,
can
you
conceive
of
any
crime
as
to
which
you
would
consider
the
death
penalty
on
appropriate
response
by
society?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
a
case
to
you,
you
read
about
buchenwald
one
of
the
camps
in
germany
in
which
thousands
of
jewish
citizens
were
exterminated,
it
is
unthinkable
that
that
could
happen
again
but
who
would
have
thought
it
would
happened
in
a
20th
century
in
a
country
as
civilized
that
germany
was
supposed
to
be.
if
we
have
had
jurisdiction
over
the
commandant
of
buchenwald,
would
you
have
thought
capital
punishment
was
an
appropriate
in
response
to
put
that
man
or
woman
was
responsible
for?
unknown
speaker
putting
him
in
prison
in
a
solitary
confinement
for
life
with
no
parole,
solitary
confinement.
unknown
speaker
you
are
foreclosing
altogether
the
use
of
capital
punishment
under
any
and
all
circumstance
and
society
must
have
some
effective
alternative
to
protect
people
and
i
am
asking
you
what
do
you
think
it
could
be?
unknown
speaker
plus
solitary
confinement.
(inaudible)
would
kill
anyone
else
in
the
prison.
would
not
kill
this
as
to
the
prisoner?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you
professor
amsterdam,
what
do
you
think
is
constitutional
and
valid,
would
you
think
the
type
of
a
punishment
that
i
have
just
suggested
would
be
constitutionally
valid?
unknown
speaker
mr.
eagles,
is
there
any
significance
on
the
ages
of
these
four
men
and
the
differences
on
those
ages.
am
i
correct?
perhaps
i
am
not.
the
two
who
did
not
receive
the
death
penalty
were
they
younger,
youngest
of
the
four?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
age
of
majority
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
all
these
were
over
18,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
can
however
find
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
a
ready
to
guilt
a
first
degree
murder
and
remand
it
for
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
eagle,
can
we
just
ask
on
the
change
that
the
new
statute
made
in
north
carolina
practice?
the
appendix
to
the
petitioners
brief
list
some
63
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
under
death
sentence.
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
be
a
somewhat
larger
number
than
it
is
true
in
other
states.
would
it
be
your
judgment
that
the
kind
of
overall
impact
of
the
change
in
the
statutory
scheme
has
been
to
increase
rather
than
to
decrease
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
north
carolina?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
my
impression
i
just
want
to-
unknown
speaker
that
covers
rape
convictions
obtained
after
waddell,
and
before
the
effective
date
of
the
new
statute
unknown
speaker
the
section
14-17
of
the
north
carolina
statute
has
this
phrase
in
it
and
it
includes
murder
by
any
other
kind
of
willful,
deliberate
and
premeditated
killing.
is
that
qualified
in
anyway,
it
seems
to
have
that
broad,
i
know
that
is
not
the
case
you
would
have
here
but
as
you
point
out,
the
petitioner
is
attacking
the
system
and
the
entire
statute
facially.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
other
statute
that
the
united
states
for
which
you
are
familiar
broad
as
this
one?
unknown
speaker
mr.
eagles
let
me
ask
one
more
question
to
be
sure
i
have
correctly
in
mind,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
in
north
carolina
unlike
louisiana,
the
trial
judge
does
not
regularly
submit
a
lesser
included
offense
instruction
to
the
jury
unless
the
evidence
warrants
the
instruction?
unknown
speaker
but
a
general
rule
is
different
from
louisiana
practice.
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
if
in
fact,
there
is
the
difference
which
the
counsel
described
and
which
i
know
you
dispute
between
the
mandatory
character
of
the
north
carolina
statute
and
the
more
of
the
greater
area
of
discretion
in
the
louisiana
practice
and
if
in
fact
the
north
carolina
practice
results
in
a
larger
number
of
death
penalties.
would
you
nevertheless
under
your
first
argument
conclude
that
the
north
carolina
statute
is
less
vulnerable
than
the
louisiana
statute,
that
is
what
i
would
understand
to
be
thrust
of
your
argument.
