putting

that
puts
a
trial

in
to
rather
a

corner,
does
it
not,

decide
that
there

no
evidence

that
is
a
little
different
from
a
sufficiency
test,
is
it
not?

would
you
say
then
that
you
are
suggesting
then
that
the
gloss

their

mr.
amsterdam,
would
you
argue
for
abolishing
the
jury
system
in
criminal
cases
because
it
produces
some
irrational
results
sometimes
in
acquittals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
arguing
now
that
we
should
abolish
of
all
system
of
punishment
because
it
works
irrationally
sometimes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
many,
many
arguments
that
is
exactly
the
same
ones
that
are
being
presented
to
us
in
this
case
that
total
life
imprisonment
and
solitary
confinement
is
a
more
cruel
punishment
and
a
more
unusual
punishment
than
death.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
not
foreclose
you
from
making
the
argument
i
have
just
made
and
i
suspect
it
would
be
made
that
that
is
more
cruel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
familiar
with
the
article
written
by
the
director
of
the
prison
system
in
minnesota
that
the
most
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
of
all
is
life
imprisonment.
he
is
a
trained
penologist.

close
over
period
of
time
six
months
or
year,
the
mcgautha
poll
and
the
harris
poll
and
all
the
other
poles
that
are
conducted,
showed
90%
of
the
people
in
this
country
in
favor
of
capital
punishment,
3%
undecided
and
a
balance
against
it.
do
you
think
that
enters
in
to
the
constitutionality
appraisal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
converse
of
that
would
be
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
got
the
impression
from
either
what
you
had
said
yesterday
or
this
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
in
someway
we
have
to
evaluate
the
standards
of
the
people
of
this
country
today
in
light
of
what
people
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
one
more
minute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
