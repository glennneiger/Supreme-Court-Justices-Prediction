mr.
amsterdam,
i
thought
i
said
that
in
my
dissent
in
furman,
precisely
that.
justice

of
course
one
does
not
read
the
dissents
anyway
but
the
argument
you
are
just
making,
you
know
as
a
professor
that
when
counsel
lose
one
case,
they
come
up
on
the
next
one
and
distinguish
it.
i
do
not
believe
is
deserved
enough
logical
consistency
necessarily
is
it?
