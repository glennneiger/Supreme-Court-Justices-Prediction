mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
several
problems
which
i
have
with
some
of
the
statements
by
mr.
amsterdam
move
me
to
depart
from
my
earlier
notions
of
how
i
would
proceed
in
order
to
put
to
rest
the
couple
of
questions
which
he
may
have
raised
in
a
minds
of
the
court,
not
in
mine
but
perhaps
in
yours.
as
i
understood
a
statement
by
mr.
amsterdam
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
that
he
said
that
in
capital
cases,
the
jury
system
cannot
be
made
rational,
i
dispute
that.
respondent
disputes
that,
the
capital
punishment
does
not
affect
the
operation
of
the
jury
system
except
to
make
our
jurors
even
more
sensitive
to
their
constitutional
and
sworn
responsibilities.
if
the
jury
system
is
not
rational
and
sometimes
there
are
cases
in
which
it
results
on
the
called
record,
seem
not
rational.
even
so,
it
is
the
best
system
known
to
man,
it
is
in
deeply
ingrained
in
our
constitutional
system
and
until
a
better
alternative
comes
along,
respondent
urges
that
petitioners
have
no
right
to
complain.
as
i
understood
mr.
amsterdam’s
argument
he
indicated
that
the
mandatory
death
penalty
had
been
repudiated
and
i
was
not
paying
as
close
attention
as
i
might
have
perhaps
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
he
said
by
this
court
or
by
the
people.
i
suggest
that
in
either
event
it
has
not
yet
been
repudiated
by
this
court,
though
two
members
of
the
court
and
furman
indicated
a
preference
in
that
direction.
and
the
people,
at
least
the
people
of
north
carolina,
the
respondent
state
have
acted
definitely
to
guarantee
a
mandatory
death
penalty
in
a
limited
series
of
cases
and
i
will
talk
more
about
that
at
an
appropriate
time.
all
the
states
have
responded
however
to
your
decision
in
furman
to
assure
that
in
those
states
in
35
odd
states,
i
understand
36
in
july
that
there
will
be
the
right
in
limited
cases
to
bring
forward
the
ultimate
sanction
of
our
criminal
justice
system,
the
death
penalty
for
the
ultimate
crimes..
the
ultimate
crime
which
present
a
threat
if
you
will,
to
our
system
of
government
and
to
the
people
of
our
country,
i
say
that
in
disrespect,
may
it
please
the
court
that
our
people
are
governed
by
their
consent,
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
establishes
purposes,
including
which
maintenance
of
domestic
tranquility.
now,
perhaps
for
those
of
us
who
are
fortunate,
domestic
tranquility
prevails
but
to
the
victim
in
this
crime,
there
is
no
domestic
tranquility,
there
is
nothing.
blank
brains
have
been
blown
out
by
small
caliber
pistol,
a
close
range
for
no
reason
except
to
eliminate
a
witness.
that
is
the
only
possible
logical
reason
that
you
can
imagine,
there
was
no
resistant,
she
was
an
elderly
woman
at
58
years,
these
are
young
strong
men
and
they
just
killed
her.
but
there
has
to
be
a
sanction
to
that
kind
of
treatment.
the
assertion
by
mr.
amsterdam
that
woodson
is
the
least
culpable
defies
my
comprehension,
much
of
his
argument
have
at
from
time
to
time
but
i
attribute
that
to
my
limitations
rather
that
to
him.
woodson
was
outside
with
a
riffle,
sitting
in
the
car
standing,
watch.
he
--
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
other
man
in
the
car
carroll,
he
was
about
to
get
out
and
shoot
stancil
if
he
had
not
pulled
him
back
into
the
car.
a
fortuitous
happenstance,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
lucky
bike
as
it
way
say
on
straight
that
stancil
was
not
shot
with
the
riffle
out
run
instead
of
merely
wounded.
mr.
amsterdam
asked
what
purpose
is
served
by
the
trial
and
by
the
death
penalty
in
these
two
cases.
well,
the
purposes
of
retributions,
specific
deterrents
and
all
the
purposes
which
have
been
discussed.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
the
two
who
did
not
receive
the
death
penalty
were
not
only
the
younger
two
of
the
four
your
honor,
they
were
the
least
expensed
as
far
as
their
background
went,
the
two
who
were
here
had
been-
by
their
own
admission
and
their
own
testimony
involved
in
some
trouble
with
the
drugs
in
new
jersey,
before
they
came
back.
not
only
that,
they
were
unarmed,
the
weapons
in
the
case
were
in
the
hands
of
woodson
who
had
the
riffle
and
waxton
who
had
the
pistol
and
shot
the
lady
in
the
head.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
18
years
old.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
the
youngest
was
18
as
i
recall
it,
i
am
sorry?
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
no
sir,
waxton
pulled
the
trigger,
the
testimony
from
all
three
of
the
witnesses
except
waxton
of
course
was
that
he
was
the
one
who
put
the
pistol
to
the
lady's
head
without
any
provocation,
but
put
the
pistol
to
the
lady’s
head
and
killed
her.
he
of
course
testified
and
we
set
this
out
in
our
brief
that
it
was
tucker,
the
other
fellow
who
was
in
there
but
even
his
co-defendant
woodson.-
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor,
the
remaining
point
that
i
wanted
to
clarify
before
beginning
for
what
i
have
prepared
to
say
has
to
do
with
the
reasons,
the
rationale
behind
two
of
these
men
being
tried
and
two
being
permitted
to
plead
and
that
is
the
necessity
of
meeting
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
to
convict.
without
the
testimony
of
at
least
one
witness
and
in
this
case
since
it
could
easily
have
been
three
against
one
or
one
against
an
absence
of
any
evidence
on
the
other
side,
not
meeting
the
burden,
the
state
was
required
to
make
sort
of
a
deal,
some
sort
of
plead
bargain
in
order
to
be
able
to
prove
immediate
proper
constitutional
burden
of
proving
the
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
proper
basis
for
complain
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
woodson,
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
plead
because
he
never
tried
to,
his
lawyer
according
to
the
record,
had
entered
in
this
negotiations
and
he
promised
that
he
would
make
some
recommendation
to
his
client
and
the
prosecutor
anticipated
the
pleas
but
one
never
was
forthcoming.
it
was
his
decision,
certainly
not
a
requirement
of
constitutional
law
that
he
be
compelled
to
plead.
in
the
case
of
waxton,
he
was
the
trigger
man
and
he
was
probably
the
dominant
individual
in
the
entire
plan.
he
was
the
one
who
actually
pulled
the
trigger
according
to
the
testimony
of
three
of
the
four
and
he
of
course
said
it
was
his
colleague,
tucker
who
was
with
him
and
even
if
that
had
been
true
under
north
carolina
law,
the
felony
murder
rule,
he
would
have
been
guilty
as
upfront.
the
practicality
of
conviction,
however,
leads
us
to
require
--
prosecutor
be
able
to
make
the
necessary
bargain
with
those
that
he
and
his
judge
pursuant
to
his
sworn,
in
his
experience
and
his
training,
determines
are
those
who
he
can
make
of
deal
with
who
will
be
willing
to
testify
for
the
state
for
conviction,
without
a
conviction
of
course,
(inaudible).
this
is
of
course,
may
it
please
the
court
not
a
package
store
situation
in
the
context
that
i
understand
package
stores
to
be.
this
was
a
convenience
market,
was
a
small
grocery
store
that
his
of
the
seven
eleven
quick
mart
type.
this
woman
was
alone
in
the
store,
these
men
came
in,
asked
for
cigarettes
and
one
them
without
any
resistance
on
her
part
put
a
pistol
to
her
head
and
shot
her,
they
seized
the
money
and
run
out
and
out
they
shot
another
man
coming
in.
they
were
tried
first
degree
murder
under
the
felony
murder
rule
in
north
carolina
since
it
was
pursuant
to
a
robbery,
they
were
convicted.
at
that
point,
there
is
absolutely
no
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
in
north
carolina
law.
he
sentenced
them
to
the
death
sentence
as
he
was
entitled
to
and
as
he
is
required
to.
the
convictions
were
unanimously
affirmed,
unanimously
not
a
single
dissenting
vote
in
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
the
same
court
had
in
ladel
split
for
three.
even
there
however,
our
supreme
court
to
a
person
stated
that
they
had
no
problems
with
any
constitutional
infirmities
of
capital
punishment
per
se.
we
urge
that
that
was
a
wise
decision,
we
urge
that
to
you.
as
we
read
the
petitioners
briefs,
they
have
not
asserted
as
we
read
it
any
equal
protection
called
or
any
as
applied
clause,
as
applied
provisions
of
the
law,
they
address
themselves
to
the
presence
or
the
existence
of
the
institutions
as
presenting
a
form
of
discretion
which
is
impermissible.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
if
you
say
insufficient
your
honor?
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
could
do
that.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
is
as
i
understand
it
in
this
particular
situation.
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
thrust
as
we
perceived
it
in,
is
that
first
on
the
one
hand
and
we,
the
north
carolina
situation
is
one
where
our
general
assembly,
our
legislature
acted
in
what
it
deemed
the
safest
way
in
response
to
this
honorable
court's
decision
in
furman,
wisely
or
unwisely
and
we
urge
that
wisdom
is
not
the
question
here,
constitutionality
is
the
question
but
wisely
or
unwisely,
they
reacted
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman
in
such
a
way
as
to
say
in
order
to
guarantee
the
protection
to
our
citizens
that
a
death
penalty
will
have
for
certain
crimes.
we
will
reduce
the
scope
of
the
crimes
to
which
it
is
applicable
but
make
it
mandatory
and
that
was
their
answer,
not
being
willing
to
second
guess
this
court
as
to
what
degree
of
discretion
or
judgment
after
sentence,
might
or
might
not
be
permissible.
in
doing
that,
they
reduce
the
number
of
crimes
from
four
to
two
and
the
one
other
than
murder
is
rape
and
it
is
a
first
degree
rape
which
is
a
new
type
of
rape
that
involves
serious
battery
injury
or
deadly
weapon
or
a
underage
victim
and
an
older
rapist.
the
first
degree
situation
however
is
the
same
as
it
was
except
to
the
punishment
is
mandatory.
one
point
which
is
made
here
as
we
perceive
it
from
petitioners
brief
is
that
there
is
an
arbitrariness
and
in
the
other
cases,
they
seem
to
say
that
this
arbitrariness
results
from
the
fairness
or
the
falsity
of
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
is
actually
levied.
to
be
sure,
that
is
not
viable
argument
in
the
north
carolina
situation,
to
be
sure.
we
would-
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
it
would
be
my
judgment
your
honor
that
it
has
resulted
in
an
increase.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir
and
we
have
today
on
death
row,
106,
we
had
a
107,
your
honor,
we
said
so
in
our
brief
and
that
time
it
was
true,
the
last
week
a
superior
court
judge
acting
pursuant
to
authorization
from
the
general
assembly,
reviewed
the
conviction
of
a
black
man
for
rape,
found
that
it
fit
the
criteria
for
second
degree
murder
and
second
degree
rape
and
reduced
it
however
it
will
soon
be
a
107
because
saturday
night,
a
jury
came
in
with
the
white
residential
construction
executive
that
had
contracted
to
murder
with
his
wife
and
found
him
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
he
just
has
not
reached
central
prison
yet
but
it
is
at
107
at
this
point
in
time.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
it
is
the
special
statutory
probation
mr.
justice
marshall
which
provides
in
the
limited
number
of
cases
where
an
individual
has
been
convicted
since
waddell
of
rape
in
the
first
degree.
there
is
a
statutory
provision
that
provides
for
post-conviction
hearing
where
you
can
reexamine
the
facts
and
say
if
this
would
have
been
second
degree
rape,
had
the
law
been
in
effect,
you
might
consider
and
a
levy
punishment
to
court
that
does
not
apply
to
murder.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding,
yes
sir.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
powell
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
the
statutes
provides
for
first
degree
murder
being
under
the
two
possibilities
your
honor,
a
list
of
established
defenses
lying
and
waive
more
about
(inaudible)
or
those
committed
by
premeditation
and
deliberation,
that
is
the
one
category
and
that
is
not
limited
as
i
understand
it.
if
there
is
premeditation
and
deliberation
and
the
judge
will
instruct
the
jury
as
to
what
they
may
consider
and
how
long
it
need
be
which
is
not
very
long
under
our
law,
then
that
is
the
first
degree
murder.
under
the
second
category
of
the
first
degree
murder
is
the
felony
murder
rule
and
in
that
situation
which
is
what
we
have
here
a
robbery
which
is
one
of
the
enumerated
defenses
on
14-17,
that
a
murder
occurred
in
the
course
of
that
robbery.
we
also
--
at
least
four
or
five
as
i
recall
and
the
other
offenses,
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
language
other
offenses
as
our
court
has
interpreted.
it
is
interpret
other
offenses
to
talk
in
terms
of
those
which
are
inherently
dangerous
to
human
life
or
those
for
which
there
is
a
substantial,
foreseeable
risk
of
death
or
killing
of
an
individual
and
a
death
results,
that
was
incidentally
one
of
the
considerations
that
the
general
assembly
took
into
account
as
it
was
determining
whether
to
pair
down
the
death
penalty
considerations
because
arson
was
formally
a
death
penalty
offense
and
they
determined
that
simple
arson
if
that
is
anomaly.
simple
arson
without
human
life
being
lost,
ought
not
to
result
since
it
would
result
in
the
death
penalty,
if
a
human
life
did
that
as
result
of
the
murder
felony
rule.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
other
statutes
of
the
united
states,
your
honor,
i
apologize.
the
basic
argument
which
we
intend
to
make
here
is
that
first
of
it
is,
there
are
two
questions
asked,
although
counsel
have
indicated.
we
agree
with
the
notion
that
there
are
two
counsel
that
there
are
two
questions.
the
due
process
portions
are
not
raised
here,
we
are
talking
about
a
per
se
system,
the
existence
of
our
discretion,
if
it
is
discretion
or
judgment
as
we
prefer
to
style
it,
since
discretion
carries
with
it
the
connotation
at
least
from
the
petitioners
brief
of
an
arbitrariness
and
a
capriciousness
which
we
believe
that
we
urge
to
you
which
we
believe
is
susceptible
to
prove
just
does
not
exist
in
our
system.
the
death
penalty
per
se
as
we
urge
it
is
not
unconstitutional,
it
is
not
required
as
we
urge.
the
plain
language
of
the
constitution
even
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
of
maturing
society
standard,
we
believe
can
only
be
developed
up
to
the
point
where
it
runs
in
to
the
plain
language
of
the
constitution
which
permits
capital
punishment,
this
is
very
explicit.
it
is
not
a
casual
references
it
is
not
a
single
reference,
a
multiple
references
by
implication
and
plaintiffs.
the
judgment
that
is
complained
off
in
this
case,
discretion
if
you
will.
is
that
judgment
that
necessarily
occurs
in
the
constitutional
mandated
process
of
trial
of
any
criminal,
any
accused
person.
the
prosecutor,
the
grand
jurors,
the
petty-jurors,
the
trial
judge
and
indeed
our
appellant
courts,
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
which
hears
every
death
case,
are
all
acting
pursuant
to
oaths
of
office,
statutory
obligations
and
in
some
cases
constitutional
obligations
under
our
constitution.
all
of
these
things
result,
we
believe
in
a
trial
which
is
necessarily,
constitutionally
perfect
in
the
sense
of
fairness
and
due
process
to
the
individual
being
tried.
having
resulted
in
this
over
200
years
of
evolution
of
this
country
and
its
judicial
system
were
shocked
frankly,
that
petitioners
now
say
that
because
things
are
so
fair
and
because
your
system
is
so
judicious
and
because
your
system
is
so
careful
about
who
finally
receives
the
death
penalty,
that
then
is
arbitrary.
it
just
does
not
follow
we
urge,
it
is
logically
fallacious,
it
is
not
supported
by
any
evidence
that
we
are
able
to
as
assign.
it
requires
we
urge
the
court,
an
assumption
that
some
or
all
of
these
officials
be
acting
in
bad
faith.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that,
certainly
not
in
this
case,
that
is
not
even
an
issue
in
this
case
but
that
specter
hangs
up
in
the
balance
as
petitioner
would
have
it
the
way
we
perceive
its
posture.
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
only
where
there
is
some
evidence,
now
there
are
cases,
may
it
please
the
court
where
reading
a
whole
record
once
hard
put
to
find
the
evidence
on
which
he
based
that
and
our
court
has
addressed
that
particular
problem
by
saying
that
doubts
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
accused
being
on
tried,
not
of
course
in
favor
of
the
whole
class
of
murders
mr.
sidney
s.
eagles,
jr.
yes
sir,
as
i
understood
the
louisiana
rule
being
explained
it
is
very
different.
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
make
before
i
conclude
is
the
notion
that
the
existence
of
the
capital
punishment
in
our
judicial
system
being
somehow
abhorrent
to
society,
there
is
no
evidence
that
we
have
found
aside
from
scholarly
writings,
cited
by
petitioner,
that
tends
to
support
that
doctrine,
kind
officers
or
the
solicitor
general
have
submitted
documentary
evidences
and
statistical
evidence
that
tends
to
go
all
the
way,
we
find
that
to
be
a
draw
if
you
will
that
the
abhorrence
is
simply
not
established
if
it
must
be.
we
urge
to
this
court
that
the
fact
that
the
general
assemblies,
legislatures,
of
the
35,
36
states
and
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
death
penalty
in
four
years
and
this
is
not
an
issue
that
is
been
ignored
in
the
past,
past
over
that
the
court
is
required
to
step
in
and
get
somebody’s
attention.
the
attention
of
the
general
assembly,
the
attention
of
all
elected
representatives
has
been
focussed
on
every
session
of
the
general
assembly
of
north
carolina
since
1961
and
perhaps
before
that
we
just
did
not
check
that
far
back.
there
has
been
a
bill
introduced
to
do
something
with
the
death
penalty,
either
modify
it
or
eliminate
it
or
change
it
or
do
something
with
it
and
they
all
failed.
the
bill
that
it
before
you
today,
the
law
that
provides
death
penalty
in
this
particular
situation,
passed
the
senate
with
only
four
dissenting
votes
of
50.
the
vote
in
the
house
were
somewhat
different
and
there
was
conference
committee,
but
the
bill
finally
came
out
as
a
compromise.
the
idea
that
death
penalty
is
abhorrent
to
the
standards
of
society’s
decency
is
simply
not
supportable,
indeed
to
strip
the
states
of
their
ultimate
punishment
to
stem
the
tide
of
robberies
and
murders
would
more
likely
offense
society.
