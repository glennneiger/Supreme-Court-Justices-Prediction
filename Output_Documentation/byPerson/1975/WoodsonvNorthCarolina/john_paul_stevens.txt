justice

that
is
it,
if
you
except
mcgautha
to
this
argument,
are
you
not
also
accepting
the
fact
that
a
stantardless
exercise
of
jury
discretion
is
something
different
from
a
lottery.
it
does
not
but
mcgautha
held
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
the
question
just
a
little
differently
then,
is
your
argument
predicated
on
the
proposition
that
standardless
discretion
is
equivalent
to
a
lottery.
the
solicitor
general
takes
precisely
the
opposite
position
on
there.
he
said
discretion
is
not
necessarily
capricious?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
any
further,
it
is
not
at
rational
basis
that
a
jury
of
12
people
differentiated.
one
jury
of
12
people
found
that
this
group
should
die
and
another
jury
found
that
they
should
not.
that
is
not
a
rational
basis
