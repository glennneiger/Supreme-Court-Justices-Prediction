justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
and
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
also
in
the
dissent,
but
for
reason
that
were
stated
in
dissent
in
furman
against
georgia.
the
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case.
and
i
should
make
clear
if
i
have
not
before
that
the
chief
justice
while
joining
my
several
opinions
in
these
cases
adheres
to
his
views
expressed
in
the
dissenting
opinions
which
he
authored
or
joined
in
furman
v.
georgia.
as
in
the
other
cases,
we
cannot
agree
that
the
death
penalty
is
invalid
under
any
and
all
circumstances.
neither
can
we
agree
that
even
though
the
north
carolina
jury
is
carefully
instructed
in
the
elements
of
felony
murder
and
even
though
it
is
instructed
that
if
a
defendant
is
found
guilty
of
murder,
the
death
penalty
must
be
imposed,
the
jury
will
so
systematically
disobey
its
instructions
that
the
death
penalty
will
be
imposed
so
seldom
and
randomly
as
to
be
invalid
punishment
under
furman
v.
georgia.
in
our
view,
the
range
of
jury
discretion
under
the
north
carolina
law
does
not
began
the
measure
up
to
that
which
exist
under
georgia,
florida,
and
texas
statutes
and
with
all
due
respect,
we
cannot
invalidate
the
north
carolina
statute
on
furman
v.
georgia
grounds,
while
at
the
same
time
sustaining
a
statute
such
as
the
state
of
the
georgia
now
has.
as
additional
grounds
which
were
not
urged
by
the
parties
for
invalidating
the
north
carolina
statute,
the
plurality
would
require
capital
punishment
statutes
to
provide
for
separate
sentencing
proceeding,
having
the
characteristics
specified
in
the
plurality
opinion.
this
holding
as
i
indicated
in
announcing
my
great
concurrence
effectively
overrule
v.
california
and
we
would
not
take
that
step
since
it
is
not
required
by
the
eighth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
we
also
cannot
agree
with
the
plurality
that
our
history
establishes
that
society
has
rejected
the
mandatory
death
penalty
for
all
first-degree
murders
as
being
below
contemporary
community
values.
it
is
true
that
for
several
reasons
the
legislatures
of
many
states
for
a
time
discarded
statutes
mandatorily
imposing
the
death
penalty
for
all
first
degree
murders
in
favor
of
statutes
giving
the
jury
unfettered
discretion
not
to
impose.
it
cannot
be
concluded,
however,
that
a
return
to
mandatory
statute
is
therefore
unconstitutional.
for
under
the
discretionary
statutes,
the
death
penalty
was
imposable
on
any
given
first-degree
murder
as
the
jury
in
its
discretion
saw
fit.
discretionary
statutes
cannot,
therefore,
stand
for
the
proposition
that
society
had
or
has
concluded
that
the
death
penalty
for
first
degree
murder
was
or
is
inconsistent
with
contemporary
standards
of
decency.
what
the
plurality
does,
is
to
strike
down
the
sentencing
statute
in
north
carolina
both
because
through
claimed
“jury
nullification”
there
is
two
much
discretion
in
the
sentencing
process
and
because
due
to
the
mandatory
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for
first-degree
murder
--
once
first-degree
murder
is
proved
there
is
too
little
discretion
in
the
system.
this
makes
little
sense
to
us
and
we
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
