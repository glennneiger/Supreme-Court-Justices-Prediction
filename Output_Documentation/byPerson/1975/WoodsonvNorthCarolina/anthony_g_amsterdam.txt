mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
before
beginning
the
presentation
of
the
argument
in
the
waxton
case,
simply
speak
to
three
question
that
came
up
in
the
previous
questioning
and
specifically
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
white
about
louisiana
practice
and
a
california
practice.
the
mystery
about
the
louisiana
practice
is
no
mystery
at
all.
it
is
explicated
at
page
33
footnote
45,of
their
brief
in
roberts
but
louisiana
supreme
court
does
not
review
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
it
does
use
a
no
evidence
test
to
review
sufficiency.
akin
to
the
thompson
v.
louisville
test,
whether
a
new
trial
motion
is
filed
or
not,
there
is
not
a
question
whether
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict,
it
is
a
no
evidence
test.
there
is
not
a
great
mystery
about
it,
just
that
they
do
not
review
sufficiency
in
the
normal
way.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
same
standard,
no
evidence
standard,
not
a
sufficiency
standard.
second
question
had
to
do
with
the
californian
practice.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
it
merits
to
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
difference
between
the
thompson
and
louisville
constitutional
no
evidence
test
and
the
standard
state
sufficiency
test.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
louisiana
law
operationally
differs
from
the
law
in
other
states
and
it
needed
the
trial
judge
nor
the
appellant
court
exercises
the
degree
of
scrutiny
over
the
evidence
and
over
the
jury
that
exists
in
other
states,
that
is
a
matter
of
degree.
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
about
california
practice,
the
reason
that
they
have
two
stages
in
california
is
that
some
of
the
special
circumstances
may
not
come
out
at
the
guilt
phase.
for
example;
the
defendant
committed
an
unrelated
murder,
that
is
one
of
the
special
circumstances,
but
and
other
reason
for
the
second
phase
is
that
at
the
first
phase
the
jury
may
not
resolve
all
of
the
relevant
issues.
for
example;
a
case
is
punishable
by
death
in
california,
if
it
first
degree
murder.
it
is
first
degree
murder
if
it
is
either
premeditated
and
deliberated
or
felony
murder.
so
what
goes
to
the
jury
is
an
alternative
submission.
premeditation,
deliberation
or
felony
murder,
then
they
come
back
at
the
penalty
stage
and
even
if
there
is
no
new
evidence
presented,
they
now
have
to
answer
both
questions
cumulatively.
and
the
answer
to
how
they
do
that
is
very
interesting.
because
in
fact,
as
mr.
justice
white’s
question
suggested,
there
are
juries
and
may
have
done
it
again
and
again
who
have
come
back
at
the
second
phase
with
a
life
sparing
verdict.
it
is
inconsistent
with
their
verdict
at
the
first
phase.
cold
blooded
murders
where
the
defendant’s
contention
was
an
alibi,
where
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
facts
of
the
case
that
a
person
whoever
he
was
who
committed
the
crime,
intentionally
premeditatedly
and
deliberatedly
committed
a
killing
in
a
course
of
a
robbery.
the
jury
then
goes
ahead
and
points
the
defendant
guilty.
and
then
it
is
asked
the
question
at
the
penalty
phase,
that
the
defending
premeditatedly
and
deliberatedly
killed
and
in
the
course,
the
felony
comes
back,
no
and
spares
the
defendants
life.
now
the
third
question
that
we
came
up
on
the
previous
arguments
that
i
would
just
like
to
mention
to
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
justice
powell,
we
do
deal
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
three
to
six
with
the
question
of
a
homicide
rape
figures
about
which
you
are
under
arrest
and
i
hope
the
court
would
look
at
our
reply
briefs
treatment
of
that
subject.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pardon
me
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
pages
three
to
six
of
the
reply
brief
and
a
homicide
rate
has
in
fact
shown
a
decrease
last
year
for
the
first
time.
but
we
deal
more
generally
with
those
figures
in
the
reply
brief.
now
if
i
may,
i
said
yesterday,
that
the
petitioners
in
the
texas
and
louisiana
cases,
may
two
separated
constitutional
contentions
against
their
sentences
of
death,
both
of
those
contentions
are
also
made
by
the
petitioners
in
this
present
north
carolina
case.
yesterday,
i
spent
all
of
my
time
talking
about
the
first
of
those
two
issues.
today,
i
would
like
to
devote
most
of
my
time
to
talking
about
the
second.
in
order
to
begin
that
however,
i
would
like
to
simply
summarize,
recapitulate,
the
essence
of
the
first
argument
in
order
to
distinguish
it
from
the
second
because
although
both
arguments
depend
upon
characteristics
of
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
under
the
present
system
putting
as
we
are
ready
in
arbitrariness,
they
are
very
different
arguments
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
state
them
succinctly.
our
first
argument
then
is
based
squarely
upon
furman
versus
georgia.
the
predicate
of
the
argument
is
arbitrary
selectivity
in
the
administration
of
the
death
penalty.
it
is
not
mere
selectivity
as
such,
it
is
arbitrary
selectivity
by
which
i
mean
that
certain
persons
are
consigned
to
die
and
others
are
spared
call
it
mercy
if
you
will
as
the
government
puts
it
but
other
people
in
a
like
situations
are
spared
with
no
meaningful
basis
to
distinguish
between
them.
that
is
an
eight
amendment
argument.
it
is
not
a
due
process
argument
because
the
eight
amendment
unlike
the
due
process
clause
is
not
concerned
with
process.
it
is
concerned
with
the
results
of
process.
the
eighth
amendment
is
concerned
with
punishment.
it
asks
whether
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
and
punishment
maybe
cruel
and
unusual
even
though
as
mr.
justice
stevens
says,
“the
results
in
a
particular
case
of
the
process
are
fair
simply
looking
at
that
case
in
isolation.”
the
eight
amendment
question
is
whether
the
result
of
that
process,
whether
fair
or
not
in
isolation
is
in
the
perspective
of
all
of
the
punishments
meted
out
by
the
system,
nevertheless,
a
cruel
unusual
punishment.
now
that
is
why
furman
is
consistent
with
mcgautha
and
that
is
why
furman
is
not
limited
to
jury
discretion.
the
government
suggests
in
its
brief
that
the
in
other
way
to
run
a
system
of
selecting
people
to
die
would
be
a
lottery.
that
is
of
all
people
convicted
of
the
first
degree
murder,
you
run
a
lottery
and
you
only
kill
some
of
them.
it
is
our
contention
that
furman
would
outlaw
that,
just
as
much
as
it
outlawed
the
jury
discretionary
systems
involved
in
furman
and
it
is
our
position
that
furman
outlaw
is
the
present
systems
before
the
court
in
these
five
cases
because
the
results
are
no
better
than
a
lottery.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
no,
no.
i
think
that
mcgautha
says
--
mr.
justice
stevens
i
am
not
sure
that
mcgautha
does
say
that.
i
am
not
sure
that
mcgautha
addresses
the
question
whether
a
lottery
would
be
unconstitutional.
it
may
well
be
that
mcgautha
is
based
on
precisely
the
notion
as
the
government
suggests
that
the
state
can
choose
any
way
it
sees
fit
as
a
matter
of
due
process
rather
than
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
for
eight
amendment
purposes,
standardless
discretion
is
equivalent
to
a
lottery
and
for
eight
amendment
purposes,
it
would
be
equivalent
to
a
system
in
which
a
prosecutor
before
a
trial
simply
could
decide
to
paper
the
case
capitally
or
not
capitally
as
he
chose.
our
point
is
that
the
eight
amendment
is
not
concerned
with
the
way
the
decision
is
made.
it
is
concerned
with
whether
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
you
look
at
it
and
you
say
these
people
are
dying
like
being
struck
by
lightning
and
these
people
are
living
and
there
is
no
rational
basis
for.
and
which
ever
procedure
immediately-
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
it
is
not,
the
fact
is
that
each
individual
jury
may
come
in
with
different
standards,
different
approaches,
there
is
no
way
to
rationalize
the
system
like
that.
now,
our
second
argument
though
is
different,
our
second
argument
i
say,
squarely,
does
not
depend
on
furman.
it
would
be
the
same
whether
furman
had
been
decided
or
not.
the
second
argument
is
that
the
death
penalty
is
an
atavistic
butchery
which
has
run
its
course.
now,
i
listened
yesterday
the
argument
of
attorney
general
in
texas
and
there
is
something
extraordinarily
striking
about
this.
attorney
general
texas
said
yesterday,
look
at
what
we
use
the
death
penalty
for
now,
we
only
use
it
for
this
limited
class
of
highly
serious
murders.
we
do
not
all
use
it
for
all
murders
anymore;
we
do
not
use
it
for
rape.
the
responding
brief
in
florida
says
look
at
the
way
we
used
the
death
penalty
now,
we
used
it
for
broader
range
than
texas
does
but
we
have
got
standards.
we
do
not
use
it
the
way,
we
used
before
furman,
they
say
it
is
not
surprising
that
sentences
determine
under
the
system
condemned
by
furman
produced
uninformed
irrational
and
freakish
results.
what
are
we
talking
about?
we
are
talking
about
the
way
of
killing
people
that
was
argued
for
by
these
very
same
states
in
this
court
five
years
ago.
we
are
talking
about
penalties
for
which
they
were
killing
people
ten
years
ago.
we
are
talking
about
penalties
for
which
15
years
ago,
they
were
killing
20
people
a
year
and
in
the
1930s
they
were
killing
200
people
a
year
and
we
are
now
told
that
it
is
no
surprise
that
they
were
found
to
be
irrational
and
arbitrary
and
uninformed.
and
what
will
we
be
told
10
years
from
now,
if
the
court
sustained
these
death
penalties
and
we
find
the
system
working
in
a
predictable
and
expectable
way
that
we
have
outgrown
these
death
penalties,
that
these
death
penalties
are
equally
purposeless
and
in
vain.
our
argument,
our
second
argument
which
does
not
depend
on
furman,
places
the
death
penalty
in
its
historical
perspective.
these
new
death
penalties
that
we
are
having
urged
on
is
that
solicitor
general
is
seeking
to
sustain
or
either
just
exactly
like
furman
that
is
the
aggravating,
mitigating
circumstances
which
amounts
to
a
process
that
is
ultimately
totally
discretionary
and
uncontrolled,
or
else
they
are
reversions,
they
are
throw
backs
to
the
old
mandatory
death
penalty
system.
now
the
mandatory
death
penalty
system
was
repudiated
in
this
country
because
it
was
intolerable
because
mandatory
death
penalties
for
crimes
were
intolerable
and
because
juries
would
not
convict.
and
so
what
happened
was
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
there
is
a
quite
a
difference,
i
think
that
when
we
are
now
told
that
the
system
under
which
hundreds
of
people
would
put
to
death,
was
arbitrary
and
uninformed
and
irrational,
with
that
is
quite
an
important
consideration
in
whether
we
should
permit
a
new
round
of
those
kinds
of
killings
to
begin.
yes,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
situation
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
suppose
if
furman
is
rejected
then
the
concession
that
the
states
are
now
making
based
on
furman
would
have
to
be
rejected
as
well.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
have
a
dialectic
process
going
on,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
states
have
responded
to
furman,
but
furman
itself
responded
what
went
before.
mandatory
capital
punishments
found
unacceptable
by
the
people
of
the
country
and
are
unacceptable
by
the
legislature.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
absolutely,
discretionary
capital
punishments
put
in
their
place
and
then
what
happened?
what
happened
was
when
given
discretion,
the
systems
of
american
criminal
justice
so
thoroughly
repudiated
the
death
penalty,
that
in
1967
for
example;
the
national
crime
commission
concluded
that
being
most
salient
characteristic
of
capital
punishment
was
that
it
was
infrequently
used.
this
court
then
as
a
result
of
that
and
i
do
not
think
wrong,
held
in
furman
versus
georgia
that,
that
kind
of
application
of
death
penalty
violated
the
constitution
and
now
indeed
the
states
have
responded,
but
how
have
they
responded?
they
have
responded
either
by
maintaining
the
old
discretionary
outlets
in
a
new
form
for
whole
sale
evasion
of
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
or
enacting
so
called
mandatory
death
penalty
schemes.
in
a
procedural
setting
where
in
fact,
all
these
escape
hatches
exist
prosecutorial
discretion,
etcetera.
now
let
me
just
point
out
that
for
our
second
argument,
the
existence
of
discretion
and
escape
hatches
and
arbitrariness
in
the
selective
system
is
not
relevant
because
of
furman,
it
is
relevant
because
it
explains
why
and
how
new
statutes
can
be
enacted
without
a
considered
judgment
that
the
death
penalty
ought
to
be
use
in
the
regular
and
even
handed
way
which
would
denote
acceptability
by
the
public
for
eight
amendment
purposes.
the
legislatures
which
have
put
these
penalties
in
know
that
they
would
be
averted,
wildly,
erradicaly,
arbitrarily,
by
a
number
of
selective
devices,
and
all
of
them
cumulatively
in
these
various
case,
and
look
at
the
case
before
the
court,
look
at
woodson
and
waxton
versus
north
carolina.
i
think
it
is
important
to
take
a
good
hard
look
at
this
case.
you
have
four
people
who
commit
a
robbery
of
a
package
store,
tucker,
carroll,
woodson
and
waxton.
the
first
one
after
their
apprehension
to
break
the
story,
to
confess,
to
come
clean
is
woodson.
woodson
also
happens
to
be
the
least
culpable
from
our
points
of
view
of
the
four.
he
goes
to
trial
because
it
is
uncontested
that
prior
to
going
out
to
the
package
store
robbery,
he
was
hit
by
waxton,
hit
so
his
eye
was
bleeding
and
he
went
alone.
now
maybe
that
is
why
tucker
and
carroll
were
willing
to
plead
guilty
and
get
life
and
at
the
end
of
this
process,
they
are
going
to
live,
they
are
in
prison,
and
they
are
going
to
live,
woodson
on
the
other
hand
and
his
lawyer
make
the
judgment
that
because
he
has
got
the
most
attractive
case,
because
he
has
got
a
duress
argument
that
the
jury
might
or
might
not
buy
because
he
did
cooperate
with
the
police,
they
can
take
the
case
in
front
of
a
jury.
so
they
go
in
front
of
the
jury,
jury
comes
back-
first-degree
murder
comes
back
death
and
woodson
is
going
to
die.
now,
is
this
unfair?
in
a
due
process
sense
maybe
“no”
,
in
a
due
process
sense,
you
take
your
money
and
you
run
your
risk”,
you
pay
your
money,
you
take
your
choice;
you
gamble,
life
or
death,
get
convicted
and
you
die.
but
is
it
that
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
let
me
ask
what
purpose
is
served
by
killing
mr.
woodson
while
tucker
and
carroll
live?
what
purpose
is
served
by
his
death,
when
hundreds
of
other
similarly
circumstanced
people,
chosen
by
processes
which
are
arbitrary
not
in
the
vindictive
sense,
not
in
the
sense
that
people
are
shirking
their
responsibilities.
but
in
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
not
at
all
and
that
is
what
i
am
saying,
it
is
not-
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
not
at
all
and
i
am
trying
very
hard
mr.
chief
justice
to
distinguish
a
due
process
argument
which
it
sails
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
indeed,
there
is
a
looseness
throughout
the
entire
system,
prosecutorial
discretion,
jury
discretion,
throughout
the
entire
system
which
may
work
irrational
results.
the
question
in
these
cases
is
whether
what
is
good
enough
for
meeting
out
remediable
punishments.
punishments
that
are
within
the
realm
of
the
knowable
and
the
curable
is
also
good
enough
for
meeting
out
the
punishment
of
life
and
death.
furman
said
“no”.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
absolutely
correct,
if
death
is
not
different
we
lose
on
every
argument
we
got
and
i
can
not-
of
course,
if
one
wanted
to
argue
retribution
one
could
say
that
the
victims
have
already
lost.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
one
wanted
to
argue
that
system
with
of
killing
killing
woodson
and
not
tucker
and
carroll
was
retributive,
yes
but
there
is
no
rational
retributive
justification
for
killing
the
people
who
are
killed
part
of
--
as
you
inspect
each
of
the
justifications
put
forward
for
the
death
penalty,
it
crumbles
in
the
face
of
the
fact.
the
north
carolina
legislature
has
said
that
everybody
who
is
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
shall
be
killed,
now
whether
they
mean
it
or
they
do
not.
if
the
justification
is
retribution
and
tucker
and
carroll
and
woodson
and
waxton,
all
of
them
ought
to
be
dead.
if
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
the
victim
is
unquestionably
dead
but
i
am
not
sure
--
it
seems
that
something
must
follow
from
that
in
terms
of
why
the
defendants
ought
to
be
dead
or
more
particular
in
this
case
why
two
of
one
want
to
be
dead
and
two
of
them
ought
to
be
alive
and
that
is
a
very
problem
we
are
putting
our
finger
on
that
when
this
court
is
told
that
legislative
judgments
are
involved
during
the
court
deferred
legislative
judgments.
a
legislature
is
not
what
is
deciding
that
particular
person
get
killed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
not
make
the
same
arguments
but
i
think
that
the
federal
statute
is
a
subject
to
attack
and
that
it
does
nevertheless
permit
even
within
a
defined
range,
in
this
respect
to
the
question
i
was
trying
to
respond
mr.
justice
stevens
on
yesterday.
i
think
that
one
can
argue
both
ways
about
whether
the
narrowing
of
the
statute,
cures
the
furman
problem
so
long
as
discretion
remains
within
that
class
defined
by
the
statute
to
sentence
for
life
or
death.
on
the
one
hand
the
narrower
you
make
the
statute
the
less
broad
the
range
of
play
for
discretion.
on
the
other
hand
the
narrower
you
make
the
statute
the
more
alike
as
your
honor
points
out,
the
people
within
the
class
are
and
the
are
more
arbitrary
therefore
is
to
distinguish
among
them
instead
of
treating
them
all
the
same.
now,
i
just
think
it
is
premature
to
anticipate
until
we
see
the
specific
statute
in
question.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
responding
your
question
well--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
second
argument
is
totally
independent
of
that,
the
second
argument
is
an
argument
that
at
this
point
in
history.
in
this
fourth
quarter-
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
that
happened
in
the
united
states
with
a
constitution
with
an
eight
amendment
in
it,
against
the
background
of
the
history,
we
have
had,
the
only
likely
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
i
probably
would
respond
the
same
way
all
of
the
human
beings
to
the
kind
of
atrocities
that
your
honor
is
raising.
we
all
have
an
instinctive
reaction
that
says
you
know
“killer”,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
that
your
honor
is
raising,
with
that
crime
or
any
other
crime,
being
consistent
with
the
eight
amendment
to
the
constitution
in
united
states
against
the
history
in
which
this
court
must
now
apply
that
amendment.
at
this
point
in
time,
my
answer
would
be
no.
that
is
a
second
of
our
two
arguments,
not
the
first
but
it
is
a
second
and
the
answer
is
categorically
no.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
powell,
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
state
must
have
and
that
it
does
have
ample
remedies
against
people
who
are
going
to
set
off
hydrogen
bombs.
there
is
no-
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
simply
no
doubt
that
it
is
not-
the
question
whether
let
him
out
in
seven
years
is
totally
different
question
as
whether
he
is
a
killer.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
questions
of
life
imprisonment
without
parole
is
also
not
before
the
court.
i
think
that
under
certain
limited
circumstances,
it
maybe
permissible
to
incarcerate
somebody--
we
are
not
going,
it
seems
to
me
constitutionally
normative
questions
mixed
up.
i
see
no
constitutional
objection
at
all.
for
life
imprisonment
without
a
parole.
as
far
as
a
normative
provision
goes,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
wise
think
but
i
am
not
sure
that
this
court
is
called
upon
to
make
those
kinds
of
judgment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
life
imprisonment
without
have
possibility
of
parole
is
quite.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well
i
just
--
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
manner
of
a
prison
management.
the
way
you
prevent
children
from
hurting
themselves
in
sharp
objects,
you
put
the
sharp
objects
out
of
their
reach,
you
do
not
punish
them
and
do
not
rely
exclusively
on
punishment
for
picking
up
sharp
object,
you
manage
the
prisons
better,
you
get
them
in
securities.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
i
would
like
to
say
if
i
may
–
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
neither
mr.
justice
burger
and
not
only
to
my
clients
but
everybody
on
death
row
appreciates
the
difference.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
death
and
imprisonment.
if--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
possible
but
it
would
certainly
rather
easy
i
think
for
this
court
to
write
an
opinion
that
said
“death
is
different”
and
make
the
attorneys
who
would
bring
those
arguments
up,
feel
rather
embarrassed
about
doing
so,
including
myself.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
article
but
i
am
familiar
with
(inaudible)
position
that
one
of
the
reasons
he
favors
a
death
penalty
is
that
capital
punishment
is
milder
than
life
imprisonment.
i
have
always
said
that
was
a
very
good
argument
for
giving
that
prison
of
his
choice.
if
i
may
reserve
such
little
time
as
i
have
in
this
court
room.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
they
urge
the
unconstitutionality
to
the
death
penalty,
and
all
other
questions,
right
now
i
do
not
recall
all
this
time,
but
there
were
all
disposed
off.
the
court
went
through
in
this
case,
examined
the
record
as
it
does
in
every
capital
case,
those
exceptions
and
objections
brought
forward
and
those
that
are
abandoned
if
they
appear
to
court
to
be
worthy
of
attention,
the
court
on
this
motion
considers
them.
in
this
particular
case,
my
recollection
is
that
primary
thrust
was
the
statement
that
had
been
made
by
woodson,
whether
or
not
that
was
admissible
and
there
was,
perhaps
some
other
questions,
i
just
do
not
recall
this
time.
the
primary
thrust
though
in
that
court
at
that
time
was
the
attack
on
the
felony
murder
rule
has
been
a
way
of
approaching
the
death
penalty
and
the
death
penalty
per
se.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
as
such
your
honor,
no.
however,
it
would
be
less
than
candid
to
say
that
our
court
does
not
treat
capital
cases
in
a
special
way.
they
examine
every
capital
case.
there
is
an
automatic
appeal
to
our
supreme
court,
every
case
comes
up
without
regard
for
the
diligence
or
competence
or
anything
else
to
the
lawyer
and
i
certainly
do
not
mean
to
apply
anything
here,
these
are
the
lawyers.
they
review
them
those
that
are
brought
forward
in
jurek
as
i
recall
the
opinion.
mr.
justice
lee
pointed
out
that
they
had
been
back
over
50
odd
exceptions
that
the
appellants
counsel
had
abandoned
and
still
found,
there
was
no
basis.
but
as
to
sentence
itself
there
is
no
way
that
our
court
can
say,
this
case
does
not
deserve
a
death
sentence,
it
gets
a
life
sentence,
you
either
by
the
conviction,
you
find
there
is
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
or
that
there
was
a
constitutional
error
of
some
form
or
that
there
was
an
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
the
non
suit
question
as
a
matter
of
law
should
have
been
granted.
in
that
case
it
goes
back
for
re-trial
but
they
cannot
adjust
the
sentence
at
that
time.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
two
minutes,
let
me
spend
half
of
one,
i
hope
that
no
more,
speaking
at
justice
stevens
question,
i
do
not
think
anybody
here
knows
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
lessors
are
submitted
as
a
matter
of
routine
in
north
carolina.
we
know
the
law,
the
law
is
that
the
trial
judge
is
not
required
to
submit
lessors
without
evidence,
but
if
he
does,
the
judgment
would
be
affirmed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
less
vulnerable
in
a
scale
of
one
to
a
hundred,
yes
but
they
are
both
vulnerable
and
the
difference
is
marginal
in
terms
of
where
the
line
ought
to
go
it
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
there
is
a
difference
between
them
but
they
are
both
well
below
the
line
of
constitutionality
and
the
difference
between
them
is
small
compared
to
the
quantum
jump
that
had
to
be
made
to
get
up
to
constitutionality.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
do
not
think
that
the
plebiscites
cut
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that
is
true
but
not
as
a
matter
of
plebiscite.
your
honor,
if-
what
if
we
possibly
ask
the
court
for
two
more
minutes,
government
has
had
or
45.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
simply
want
to
make
more
points
very
clear,
first
of
all,
to
attack
a
death
penalty
on
eight
amendment
grounds
is
not
to
express
sympathy
for
crime.
it
is
not
to
express
coalescence
with
regard
to
victims.
the
death
penalty
maybe
the
most
--
the
greatest
obstacle
to
adequate
enforcement
of
crime
in
this
country
today
because
it
saps
public
conscience
and
make
succinct,
we
are
doing
something
about
serious
crime
instead
of
devising
other
methods
of
dealing
with
it.
secondly
we
are
taxed
in
this
case
and
have
been
throughout
our
eight
amendment
presentation
with
the
notion
that
we
were
seeking
to
have
this
court,
use
subjective
gut
feelings
to
be
a
super
legislature
that
is
not
true.
our
position
is
the
only
coherent
analytic
position
of
the
eight
amendment.
the
government
says
that
the
death
penalty
for
jay
walking
would
be
bad,
why?
because
there
is
an
emotional
feeling
that
is
being
invited
that
that
is
too
much.
it
cannot
be
that
it
is
a
comparative
test
such
as
solicitor
general
bork
suggests.
the
eighth
amendment
was
written
reply
only
to
the
federal
government
not
to
the
state
it
could
have
been
asking
a
comparative
question.
we
submit
simply
that
our
argument
has
a
coherent
eighth
amendment
base
is
adequately
improperly
based
on
the
facts
accounts
for
the
needs
of
law
enforcement
of
protection
of
victims
and
under
that
view,
the
death
penalties
is
violation
to
the
eight
amendment.
thank
you
for
the
extra
time.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
none
of
them
is
close
enough
so
that
i
can
give
a
meaningful
answer
to
that
question.
it
is
not,
i
am
not
tying
to
simply
comp
off
question,
it
just
that
they
do
not
come
close
enough,
they
are
so
close
together
in
their
total
impact
and
where
they
are
is
so
far
from
where
they
got
to
pay
that
to
draw
that
marginal
differences
is
essentially
i
think
meaningless
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
i
will
say
that
one
of
the
problems
with
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes
and
i
think
we
have
got
a
phrase
right
after
this,
is
though
in
80
or
90%
of
the
cases,
at
a
process
through,
the
all
of
the
actors
involved,
the
prosecutor,
the
jury
everybody
recognizes
a
power,
an
extra
legal
power
and
frequently
exercise
in
it.
some
poor
cases
go
right
through
to
the
mail
and
nobody
recognized
they
got
the
power
and
these
people
end
up
dead
because
nobody
realized
that
all
the
discretion
which
is
in
the
system,
which
is
exercised
and
used
by
other
prosecutors
and
other
juries
was
even
available
and
that
is
a
very
bad
thing
but
is
it
bad,
is
it
worst
than
what
goes
under
a
system
in
which
overt
discretion
allows
inconsistent
judgments
with
no
accountability.
i
think
they
are
both
bad
and
as
bad,
the
best
i
can
do.
thank
you
court.
