mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
on
april
28th,
1972,
the
petitioner
ralph
nader,
arrived
at
national
airport
to
take
an
allegheny
airlines
flight
to
hartford,
connecticut.
when
he
arrived
at
the
boarding
gate
and
plenty
of
time
of
the
flight,
he
had
a
confirmed
reservation
and
had
a
proper
ticket
for
the
flight.
but
the
agent
told
him
that
the
plane
was
already
full
and
he
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
on.
allegheny
had
overbooked
this
flight
and
it
had
oversold
it
and
in
the
parlance
of
the
airline
industry,
mr.
nader
had
been
bumped.
just
like
900
other
people
had
been
bumped
that
very
month
by
allegheny
airlines
and
16,000
other
people
had
been
bumped
during
a
period
of
3-and-half
years.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
civil
aeronautics
board
approved
an
industry
plan
for
a
no-show
penalty
but
the
airlines
did
not
like
it
and
the
public
apparently
did
not
like
it.
all
of
those--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
if
the
no-shows
were
penalized--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
one
of
the
problem
with
the
no-show
plan,
that
was
tried
and
they
have
never
been
able
to
work
this
out,
is
that
apparently
a
lot
of
the
no-shows
really
are
not
the
fault
of
the
passenger
and
there
is
apparently
a
minority
of
individual
passengers
who
simply
neglect
to
cancel
their
reservation
or
do
not
show
up.
a
lot
of
the
no-shows
are
caused
by
mis-connecting
flights
for
example.
traffic
jams
and
this
is
particularly
so
with
the
security
apparatus
at
the
airport
now,
people
get
hung
up
trying
to
get
to
the
plane.
so,
there
are
lots
of
mitigating
factors
that
have
made
the
no-show
penalty
concept
a
difficult
one
to
work
out
for
the
industry.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
do
not
think
so.
the
problem
here
is
not
that
there
was
overbooking
but
that
when
allegheny
told
mr.
nader
that
he
had
a
confirmed
reservation,
it
did
not
give
him
the
most
important
piece
of
information
of
all
which
was
that
there
was
a
significant
risk
that
he
might
be
bumped
from
the
flight.
and
if
he
had
known
that
in
advance,
he
could
have
protected
himself.
he
could
have
arrived
earlier
to
the
airport
than
he
did
to
improve
his
chances
of
getting
on
the
plane.
he
could
have
taken
an
earlier
flight
or
could
even
have
taken
a
train
to
hartford.
so
it
is
not
the
fact
that
the
airlines
overbooked
that
is
involved
here
but
the
fact
that
allegheny
conceals
this
practice
and
the
fact
that
--
and
conceals
the
fact
that
bumping
results
from
it.
when
a
passenger
finds
out,
it
is
simply
too
late
for
them
to
do
anything.
and
when
mr.
nader
found
out
about
this,
there
was
no
way
he
could
get
to
hartford
in
time
for
his
commitment,
speaking
engagement
without
the
window
and
his
host
hartford
were
embarrassed
and
discredited
in
their
fund-raising
efforts.
the
thousands
of
people
who
were
coming
out
to
hear
him
during
the
lunch
hour
went
away
with
disappointment.
as
a
result,
the
petitioner
filed
a
suit
for
damages
against
allegheny
and
two
claims
were
pressed
in
this
action.
first,
there
was
a
statutory
claim
under
the
aviation
act,
alleging
discrimination
in
not
honoring
his
reservation
priority,
and
secondly,
and
this
is
a
claim
that
is
involved
here.
there
was
a
tort
claim
of
fraudulent
misrepresentation
arising
under
the
common
law
of
the
district
of
columbia.
and
after
a
trial
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
found
in
petitioner's
favor
on
both
of
these
he
wanted
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
on
appeal,
the
d.c.
circuit
issued
a
lengthy
opinion
which
it
reversed
and
remanded
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
only
issue
of
that
decision
that
had
issue
here
involves
its
holding
on
the
misrepresentation
claim.
as
to
which
the
appellate
court
divided
2:1.
the
majority
held
that
the
common
law
misrepresentation
claim
should
have
been
referred
for
an
initial
determination
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
it
held
that
regardless
of
the
language
in
the
federal
aviation
act,
that
preserves
common
law
remedies
the
cab
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
approve
conduct
by
an
airline
that
otherwise
would
be
a
tortuous
misrepresentation.
and
if
it
does
so
the
majority
held,
any
common
law
right
of
action
to
recover
damages
for
an
injury
that
is
caused
by
that
conduct
would
be
extinguished.
and
judge
fay
dissented
on
this
point.
he
said
that
this
result
that
was
not
called
for
by
the
aviation
act
and
in
fact
was
contrary
to
that
act.
and
that
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
federal
aviation
act
--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
the
district
court--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
believe
that
would
be
correct
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
the
federal
aviation
act
of
course
is
the
organic
statute
that
sets
forth
in
considerable
detail,
the
powers
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
has
to
regulate
the
airlines
industry.
there
are
two
sections
of
this
act
that
are
directly
involved
in
this
case.
first
is
section
411.
this
section
says
that
if
the
cab
finds
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served,
it
may
investigate
and
determine
whether
airlines
or
ticket
agents
are
engaging
in
unfair,
deceptive
practices
or
unfair
methods
of
competition.
and
if
so,
the
cab
has
cease
and
desist
power
to
bring
that
conduct
to
an
end.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
the
judgment
under
the
federal
law
was
remanded
for
additional
findings,
relating
to
the
details
of
what
happened
at
the
boarding
gate
and
we
are
going
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
due
course
and
try
to
ascertain
what
those
proper
findings
should
be
under
the--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
that
is
right
your
honor.
the
ruling
was
not
that
we
could
not,
in
fact
the
ruling
said
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
judgment
there.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
how
the
facts
came
out.
yes.
now
section
411
does
not
say
that
the
cab
can
approve
any
unfair
methods
of
competition
and
it
does
not
say
that
it
can
approve
unfair
or
deceptive
practices.
it
does
not
say
that
the
board
can
immunize
any
practices
from
the
common
law
liability.
the
next
section
that
is
relevant
here
is
1106,
which
says
as
follows,
nothing
in
this
act
shall
in
anyway
abridge
or
alter
the
remedies
now
existing
at
common
law
or
by
statute
but
the
provisions
of
this
act
are
in
addition
to
such
remedies.
in
other
words,
this
means
that
provisions
like
411,
which
create
new
remedies
to
deal
with
unfair
practices
and
other
kinds
of
problems
in
the
airline
industry.
those
remedies
do
not
take
away
the
old
remedies
that
might
exist
under
state
law.
the
decision
below
simply
ignores
the
section
1106.
the
majority
held
that
the
common
law
remedies
for
fraud
and
deceit
cannot
remain
totally
unaffected
by
the
federal
aviation
act.
but
section
1106
explicitly
says
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
are
in
addition
to
common
law
remedies.
not
that
they
undercut
or
restrict
them
in
any
way.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
do
not
believe
that
the
board
has
any
such
power
to
authorize
any
airline
to
conceal
material
faction
of
public
or
to
deceive
any
passenger.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
the
point
is
that
we
are
not
complaining
about
overbooking
here.
what
we
are
complaining
about
is
that
they
do
not
disclose
to
you
the
materiality
that--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
there
is
a
plan
under
which
the
board
has
approved
a
program
that
in
effect
is
overbooking.
this
is
the
program
of
eastern
airlines--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
it
is
announced
to
the
public
set
forth
in
the
tariffs,
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
and
furthermore
the
board
has
made
clear
that
the
airline
has
to
disclose
to
the
passenger
when
he
gets
this
kind
of
reservation
that
he
might
be
bumped
and
that
is
the
genius
of
this.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
in
addition
to
the
tariff.
yes.
and
the
similar
factor
occurs
in
the
liability
limitation
area.
the
board
has
made
clear
that
you
have
to
specifically
make
sure
the
passenger
knows
it.
when
he
checks
his
baggage,
he
is
subject
to
liability
limitations,
that
is
in
the
tariff,
in
addition
to
board
has
imposed
additional
disclosure
requirements
and
this
is
true
in
the
overbooking
area.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
he
must
be
specifically
advised
to
that
--
that
is
specifically
set
forth
in
the
regulations.
judge
fay’s
dissent
pointed
out
correctly,
i
think
that
the
concept
that
the
board
could
ever
immunize
tortuous
misrepresentations
by
an
airline
from
the
liability
of
the
common
law
would
really
nullify
section
1106.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
he
was
referring
to
the
same
thing
we
have
been
talking
about
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
it
talking
about.
it
is
the
failure
to
disclose
the
material
relationship
between
the
bumping
and
the
reservation
that
you
think
is
going
to
assure
your
transportation.
so
furthermore,
when
the
majority
below
said
that
--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
i
do
not
know,
i
mean
that
is
really
what
we
were
talking
about.
these
are
non-
representation,
so
i
do
not
have
any
argument
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
that.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
that
is
absolutely
right.
i
think
if
somebody
were
bumped
tomorrow,
i
mean,
this
very
proceeding
has
made
the
situation
somewhat
different
in
terms
of
people’s
expectations
about
what
happens
to
the
airline
gate.
i
mean
each
of
these
tort
of
claims
comes
up
under
its
own
set
of
facts
and
you
have
to
prove
it
under
the
common
law
as
you
find
it
and
i
think
they
could
cross
examine
the
bumpy
who
suffer
this
tomorrow
and
say,
well,
did
you
not
know
that
mr.
nader
had
been
bumped,
most
people--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
it
is.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
do
not
know.
i
did
not
--
i
do
not
think
that
those
people
know
--
you
might--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
i
mean--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
they
did
try
that
in
the
court,
in
the
district
court
did
fight
for
them.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
the
district
court
made
an
affirmative
finding
that
mr.
nader's
reliance
was
a
reasonable
one
here
that
he
did
expect
that
this
was
an
assurance
of
accommodation
on
the
flight
and
in
fact--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
do
not
recall
your
honor.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
i
do
not
recall
that.
i
know
a
number
of--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
that
is
right.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
there
maybe
a
different
case
and
each
one
turns
on
its
own
facts
when
you
are
talking
about
the
common
law.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
the
percentage
is
about
99.94%
chance
that
you
will
be
accommodated.
now,
of
course
that
includes
all
the
flights
that
are
not
oversold
at
all
because
there
are
not
even
a
hundred
passengers
for
the
hundred
seats
but--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
could
not
tell
you
that.
my
impression
is
that,
yes
they
are.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
think
as
i
recollect
his
testimony,
he
did
indicate
that
he
might
have
taken
an
earlier
flight
or
--
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
recall
exactly
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes,
and
as
a
many
of
fact
we
had
some
discussion
with
what
--
whether
mr.
nader
could
be
here
today
for
the
argument.
he
has
to
be
in
michigan
and
he
had
to
take
an
earlier
flight
because
he--[laughter]
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
when
you
translate
that
out
to
the
absolute
numbers,
what
you
are
talking
about
is
a
100,
000
people
every
year.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
that
is
right.
i
think
the
odds
--
the
odds
mount
up
if
you
travel
in
a
considerable
amount
of
time.
whatever
the
case
maybe,
there
is
a
lot
of
people
that
will
be
bumped
and
it
is
something
the
airlines
have
known
about
it
and
for
some
reason
i
do
not
want,
they
have
not
wanted
the
passenger
to
know
about
it.
i
think
that
their
concern
that
the
passengers
might
not
like
it,
might
not
like
that
risk.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
that
is
right
your
honor.
this
case
really
boils
down
to
is
--
the
concept
that
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
the
cab
might
have
the
power
to
approve
a
common
law
fraud.
this
is
a
new
doctrine
of
administrative
law,
deception
in
the
public
interest
and
the
whole
point
of
section
411,
is
that
deception
is
not
good
for
you.
411
was
designed
to
protect
people
from
deception
and
not
to
protect
deceivers.
if
the
congress
is
in--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
it
is
not
an
implied
contract,
your
honor,
it
is
a
very
specifically
detailed
contract
that
is
set
forth
in
the
tariffs.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
for
its
purpose,
under
its
statute,
under
section
411,
it
could
and
it
has
done
precisely
that.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
it
could
say--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
do
not
believe
they
could.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
think
the
best
way
to
approach
is
to
look
at
the
situation
where
the
board
does
have
specific
statutory
powers
to
approve
conduct
that
might
be,
might
violate
the
law.
in
the
anti-trust
field,
we
have
three
different
sections
in
which
the
cab
has
specifically
given
power
and
it
has
very,
very
carefully
spelled
out
to
approve
conduct
that
would
otherwise
violate
or
might
otherwise
violate
the
administrative
anti-trust
laws.
these
are
sections
408,
409
and
412
on
the
federal
aviation
act.
and
when
the
board
does
give
that
kind
of
approval
under
these
sections,
under
these
specific
provisions,
section
414
of
this
act
specifically
says
that
these
transactions
are
thereby
immunized
from
anti-trust
liability.
there
is
simply
no
comparable
language
in
this
act
that
would
authorize
the
board
to
sanction
deceit
by
an
airline
under
any
circumstance
or
to
immunize
the
concealment
of
material
facts
from--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
if
that
just
what
the
--
the
respondents
here
are
saying
the
board
has
said
that,
do
not
disclose.
it
says,
it
is
against
the
public
interest
for
you
to
disclose
the
truth.
first
of
all,
they
simply
have
not
said
anything
of
a
kind.
what
they
have
said
is
that
you
retain
your
common
law
right
to
go
to
court.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
would
have
any
power
to
tell
an
airline
that
it
may
not
disclose
the
truth.
that
is
simply
beyond
anything
--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
or
that
it
must
not
disclose.
yes.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
and
i
--
this
act
simply
gives
the
board
no
such
power.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
if
it
did,
i
think
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
what
they
can
do
is
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
section
411,
they
are
not
or
and
the
other
parts
of
its
statute,
they
are
not
going
to
try
to
get
in
to
detailed
regulation
of
this
kind
of
area.
what
they
are
going
to
do
is
leave
this
to
free
enterprise
system
to
work
out.
i
think
that
is
what
they
have
done
here.
but
they
have
never
said
that
they
are
going
to
preempt
common
law
remedies
and
i
do
not
think
they
could
in
this
kind
of
area.
now,
suppose
someone
had
come
in
and
filed
a
tariff,
if
it
had
filed
a
tariff
saying
the
reservation
means
that
you
are
going
to
be,
you
maybe
overbooked
and
you
are
or
you
have
an
assumption
of
risk.
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
it
would
certainly
help
your
honor.
i
think
you
would
have
a
lot
harder
time
making
out
a
common
law
tort
claim.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
i
do
not
know
what
would
be
satisfactory
for
the
airlines
to
do,
i
mean
there
is
a
lot
of
possibilities
where--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
i
think
you
are
a
little
late
by
the
time
you
get
the
guy
to
the
airline
counter
to
tell
him
that
they
overbooked
these
flights
but--
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
well,
if
it
is
on
a
stake
it
--
i
think
that,
i
mean
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
it
might
be
a
defense
to
acclaim
that
the
plaintiff
had
been
deceived.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
yes.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
but
that
does
not
involve
the
slightest
bit
of
concealment,
i
mean
they
are
telling
you
they
are
--
they
are
telling
you
and
you
can
assume
that
risk
safely
it
seems
to
me
and
make
your
own
judgment.
that
as
i
say,
that
is
the
genius
of
these
eastern
airline
system
that
they
--
in
which
they
do
tell
you
that,
look,
you
are
in
a
class
that
people
that
might
get
bumped
here.
and
if
you
do
not
like
it,
take
an
earlier
flight
or
go
in
another
airline
and
if
you
do
like
it,
if
you
do
get
bumped,
you
might
get
you
might
get
the
--
the
denied
boarding
compensation
penalty.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
i
do
not
know
how
it
would
come
out
if
some,
i
mean
as
a
practical
matter
of
people
do
not
read
the
tariffs
but
they
are
held
to
be
binding
as
a
matter
of
law
here,
deemed
to
have
notice
of
everything
that
is
in
the
tariffs
and
the
case
has
consistently
held
this.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
different
case
from
the
one
we
have
here.
so
the
decision
below
would
turn
this
act
on
its
head,
411
says
that
the
cab
can
eliminate
deceptive
practices,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
it
can
approve
deception
in
the
public
interest.
1106
says
that
the
common
law
remedies
survived
and
that
new
statutory
powers
here
are
an
addition
to
these
remedies.
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
the
common
law
must
be
altered
and
these
remedies
are
subordinated
to
administrative
powers
that
are
not
even
stated
in
the
act.
i
think
that
this
decision
calls
for
a
major
reallocations
of
functions
between
the
common
law
of
courts
and
the
federal
agency.
this
would
seriously
disrupt
a
statutory
scheme
and
as
judge
fay
said,
it
is
plainly
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress.
so
we
respectfully
urge
that
you
reverse
the
decision
below.
mr.
reuben
b.
robertson,
iii
they
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
level
that
the
case
was
so
important
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
file
their
brief
five
months
after
all
of
the
briefs
were
due,
i
must
say
over
my
objection.
but
then
they
apparently
lost
interest
in
the
case,
i
assume
they
feel
that
i
can
adequately
represent
their
interest.[laughter]
