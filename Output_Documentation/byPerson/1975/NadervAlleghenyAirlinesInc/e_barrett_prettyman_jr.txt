mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
only
one
single
and
very
narrow
question
and
that
is
whether
the
cab
does
have
power
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
notice
to
the
public
of
overbooking
by
regulated
carriers.
now,
we
have
to
start
with
overbooking
itself
even
though
it
is
not
directly
involved
here.
in
the
first
place,
petitioner
concedes
that
overbooking
itself
is
not
illegal
per
se
and
in
the
second
place
the
overbooking
part
of
the
case
if
you
will
has
been
remanded
back
and
it
is
not
before
you.
but
the
reason
that
we
have
to
start
with
overbooking,
the
reason
that
it
is
relevant
is
that
if
petitioner
is
successful
here,
there
will
be
an
end
to
overbooking.
he
has
a
letter
in
the
record
indicating
that
is
really
what
he
is
trying
to
do.
he
is
not
trying
to
get
damages
or
fraud
--
misrepresentation,
he
is
using
that
as
a
vehicle
to
stop
overbooking
and
the
cab
has
said
in
fact
that
if
notice
is
published,
overbooking
will
stop.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
the
25
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
notice
is
given
to
the
public
overbooking
is
going
to
have
to
stop.
obviously,
if
somebody
--
one
of
two
things
is
going
to
happen.
somebody
calls
up
on
the
phone
and
he
says,
i
want
to
make
a
reservation
to
go
to
chicago
and
they
say,
alright,
we
are
giving
you
a
reservation
but
we
should
tell
you
that
this
is
not
really
a
reservation
because
there
is
a
chance
that
you
maybe
get
on
the
plane.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
that
is
a
very
special
kind
of
a
plan
whereby
eastern
tells
you
in
advance
that
you
might
not
and
you
therefore
choose
to
go
out
to
the
airport
because
you
really
do
not
want
to
get
anywhere
necessarily
at
that
time
and
if
you
do
not
get
that
flight,
you
can
get
some
other
flight
and
you
get
it
free.
but
the
point
of
it
sir,
that-that
is
not
what
the
174
million
passengers
a
year
who
travel
want,
that
most
people
do
not
go
on
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
right.
they
do
not
go
on
eastern
leisure
class.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
exactly
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
very
true
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
but
i
would
suggest
you
that
they
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
questions
that
the
cab
has
now
been
struggling
with
for
20
years.
because
this
goes
back
to
1956,
when
they
first
took
a
look
at
this
whole
problem.
and
since
then
as
i
am
going
to
detail
for
you,
they
have
dealt
with
it
in
some
length
and
some
depth
and
they
have
reached
a
number
of
conclusions
that
i
think
you
ought
to
know
about.
because
what
you
are
going
to
do
if
you
hold
for
him
is
you
are
going
to
take
this
whole
problem
away
from
the
cab
that
has
been
attempting
to
deal
with
it
for
20
years.
and
has
detailed
regulations
on
the
subject,
has
detailed
regulations
on
the
subject
and
you
are
going
to
say,
no,
we
are
going
to
allow
$25,000
awards
which
in
effect
is
going
to
not
only
bring
a
stop
to
overbooking
which
the
cab
has
said
definitely
is
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
say
that
the
cab
has
power
to
regulate
both
in
the
area
of
overbooking
and
in
the
area
of
notice
to
the
public.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
absolutely.
i
will
tell
--
think--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice,
we
say
two
things.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
that
was
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
here.
is
that
this
is
a
matter
which
should
first
be
sent
to
the
cab
to
determine
first
of
all
whether
they
have
already
ruled
on
it
as
we
think
they
have.
and
secondly,
if
they
have
not
ruled
on
it
to
get
the
benefit
of
their
judgment
before
the
court’s
try
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
this
amounts
to
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
section
1106
is
precisely
the
language
that
went
way
back
1906
in
the
texas
pacific
case,
do
you
remember?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
this
court
has
ruled
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
all
it
means
is
that
all
of
your
remedies
are
preserved
except
for
those
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
agency
determination.
that
is
all
that
means,
that
is
what
they
said
in
texas
&
pacific
where
you
had,
where
they
tried
to
bring
the
suit
because
of
bad
rates
and
they
said
no,
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
agency’s
jurisdiction
to
determine
rights
and
therefore
despite
with
this,
even
though
it
was
a
common
law
defense--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
no.
that
is
exactly
the
point.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
not
a
different
case
your
honor
and
let
me
make
this
very
clear
to
you.
back
in
1967,
the
cab
issued
detailed
regulations
dealing
with
overbooking
and
with
denied
boarding
compensation
and
they
decided
that
because
of
the
extraordinary
no-show
problem
which
amounts
to
almost
10%
of
your
sales,
i
think
you
got
to
get
a
picture
of
what
goes
on
here
at
these
airports.
28%
cancellations,
20%
of
your
--
of
there
is
a
20%
turn
over
in
seats
in
the
last
6
hours
before
the
flights
take
off.
airlines--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
only
a
very
small
part
of
it,
we
say.
and
the
figures
here
are
in
conflict,
the
hearing
examiner
decided
that
it
was
somewhere
between
50
and
60%,
he
could
not
decide
who
was
the
major
contributor
to
no-shows
but
certainly
a
great
number
of
no-shows,
i
would
say
at
least
in
the
area
of
half
are
simply
people
who
make
reservations
and
who
do
not
turn
up.
now,
that
problem
was
costing
the
airlines
industry
at
over
$18
million
dollars
a
year
and
the
board
being
extremely
concerned
with
this
decided
that
they
would
issue
detailed
regulations
and
allow
overbooking
to
take
place
and
if
there
was
an
over
sale
to
allow
a
specific
amount
of
denied
boarding
compensation.
alright,
the
next
thing
that
came
along
was
this
problem
of
notice.
and
i
will
be
very
frank
with
you.
their
first
reaction
to
it
was
the
same
as
mr.
nader’s.
their
first
reaction
was,
well,
it
is
kind
of
deceptive
not
to
tell
the
public
and
consequently,
we
will
have,
the
first
suggestion
was,
24
hours
before
notice,
before
flight
time.
and
then
the
second
suggestion
and
this
they
were
actually
going
to
make
a
rule.
they
issued
a
notice,
a
proposed
rulemaking
that
you
had
to
give
12
hours
notice,
if
you
overbook
to
the
passengers
on
the
plane,
what
happened?
the
airlines
came
in
and
they
show
precisely
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
he
think--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
respectfully
disagree
your
honor
because
i
think
that
what
he
is
saying
is
that
the
--
when
he
called
to
make
a
reservation,
they
failed
to
give
him
notice
that
he
might
not
get
on
the
flight
because
of
an
overbooking
situation.
now
the
problem,
you
got
to
understand
this
overbooking,
this
is
not
designed
to
create
over
sales.
if
the
thing
works
perfectly,
there
is
no
over
sale.
for
example,
just
take
this
very
flight.
this
very
flight
had
a
history
of
leaving
with
6,
an
average
of
6
empty
seats
on
every
flight.
so
what
they
were
doing
and
was
overbooking
in
attempt
to
compensate
for
those
empty
seats.
they
only
had
one
prior
instance
of
overbooking
on
this
particular
flight.
so
it
does
not,
it
--
you
should
not
the
impression
that
this
thing
is
just
a
sloppy
method.
it
is
done
through
a
computer
in
an
attempt
to
make
every
flight
leave
with
every
seat
taken,
and
that
is
why
the
cab
very
concerned
about
over
sales
said
in
effect
that
over
--
we
are
going
to
improve
in
overbooking
so
long
as
you
have
three
conditions
and
they
are
very
important.
first
of
all,
you
have
to
get
denied
boarding
compensation,
has
to
be
handed
to
the
man
if
there
is
an
over
sale
right
on
the
spot.
secondly,
you
have
to
have
priority
rules
so
that
you
are
fair
to
the
over
if
over
sales.
if
you
have
more
than
one
that
they
are
treated
in
a
proper
manner
and
finally,
that
you
have
to
file
with
us
quarterly
and
monthly
detailed
reports
with
the
cab
of
your
over
sales,
they
get
monthly
reports
about
this.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
overbooking
is
meaningless
until
it
results
in
an
over
sale
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
it
does
not.
they
are--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
but
the
statistics
show
whether
they
would
be
reasonable
because
if
their
overbooking
is--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor
because
if
they
have
too
many
over
sales,
it
is
an
obvious
indication
that
the
overbooking
is
not
working.
in
other
words,
by
the
reports
they
get
every
month
of
over
sales,
they
can
tell
whether
an
airlines
is
out
of
kilter
in
terms
of
its
overbooking
because
of
it
has
too
many
over
sales,
then
obviously,
the
system
is
not
working
right.
we
for
example,
allegheny
are
below
the
average
--.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
absolutely,
and
more
detailed
than
that.
it
is
in
the
records
as
to
precisely
what
the
reports
are.
now,
i
want
to
get
back
to
this
notice
thing
again
because
i
think
it
is
extremely
important.
when
it
was
suggested,
that
the
public
be
told
about
the
overbooking
situation
and
that
they
might
not
get
on
the
flights.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
that
the
notice
would
be
of
the
kind
that
he
seeks
here
and
that
is
when
you
call
up.
they
qualify
your
confirmation.
in
other
words
they
say,
alright,
so
we
are
going
to
put
you
on
this
plane
but
you
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
you
might
not
get
on
it.
now,
listen
to
what
the
board
said
when
it
rejected
a
rule
specifically
designed
to
do
that.
it
said,
this
is
the
boards’
words,
not
what
the
airlines
argued
to
them,
he
said,
the
result
in
confusion,
alarm,
bitterness
and
cancellation
of
reservations.
it
referred
to
the
very
sizable
number
of
peoples
needlessly
alarmed
by
the
notification
of
their
overbook
status.
they
referred
to
reservations
that
would
have
been
canceled
on
flights
which
actually
could
have
accommodated
the
passengers.
they
talked
about
a
large
number
of
passengers
who
would
be
denied
reservations
on
flights
which
because
of
reservations
turn
over
and
no-shows
would
depart
with
empty
seats.
what
are
they
saying
here?
they
are
saying
that
here
in
an
effort
to
make
up
for
the
problem
of
no-shows,
we
are
going
to
allow
you
to
overbook
then
if
you
are
going
to
give
notice,
you
are
going
to
exacerbate
the
very
problem
that
we
are
faced
with
in
the
first
place.
because
you
are
going
to
have
people
making
multiple
reservations
and
a
lot
of
people
not
showing
up
and
instead
of
6
empty
seats
on
allegheny
flight
864,
you
are
going
to
have
15
or
30
seats
if
you
start
telling
the
public
this.
now
the
point
i
want
to
make
to
you
is
this--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
what
they
did
was
have
they,
if
you
look
at
part
250
in
the
regulations,
they
have
a
detailed
plan
for
what
happens
when
you
overbook
and
have
an
over
sale
and
the
second
thing
you
have--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
that
if
it
says
that
it
is
overbooked?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
it
is
not--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
may
go
out
of
business
but
it
is
not
--
may
not
in
violation
of
any
cab
order.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
i
will
tell
you
this,
i
think
that
if
tomorrow,
an
airline
began
telling
the
public
that
they
might
not
get
on
to
this
flights,
it
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
cab--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
you
and
i
may
argue
about
the
wisdom
of
both
overbooking
and
denied
boarding
conversation
and
notice.
but
the
real
point
is
that
that
we
should
not
be
here
arguing
this.
we
should
not
have
40
pages
of
brief
and
talk
back
and
forth
about
whether
this
is
wise
or
not.
this
is
what
the
cab
is
for.
this
is
precisely
what
it
is
designed
to
do.
to
take
into
consideration
the
pros
and
the
cons
of
notice,
there
are
things
to
be
said
against
notice.
there
are
things
to
be
said
in
favor
of
it.
but
this
is
precisely
what
this
agency
is
designed
to
do
is
to
take
the
public
interest.
not
mr.
nader’s
particular
problem
which
of
course
is
serious
to
us
but
to
take
the
entire
public
interest
problem
into
consideration
and
say,
now,
wait
a
minute.
we
were
going
to
issue
this
rule
requiring
notice
we
find
as
i
have
read
it
to
you
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they
might
find
that
there
is
no
common
law--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i
am
not,
conceded
this
common
law
of
fraud--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
difficulty
your
honor
is
that,
the
primary
jurisdiction
problems
enters
the
case
before
that.
in
other
words,
where
it
should
enter
that
case
is
when
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
certainly
enters
it
in
the
connection
with
notice.
that
is
right,
but
he
is
claiming
that
he
did
not
receive
notice
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
that
is
true.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
the
--
the
point
i
do
want
to
make
is
that
when
the
first
--
when
the
case
first
comes
up
and
it
is
first
presented
in
district
court
is
at
the
point
where
this
court
seems
to
me
has
said
in
enumerable
cases,
cases
like
ricky
for
example.
not
just
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
cab
because
they
have
some
kind
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
this
even,
we
think
they
do.
but
even
to
get
their
view
about
this
is
helpful
for
us
in
deciding
this
kind
of
case.
in
other
words--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
would
be
the
faa
but
it
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
but
that
is
more
or
like
our
priority
problem
here
which
is
a
different
problem.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
if
you
have
your
priorities
on
file
and
if
you
violated
your
priority,
then
that
is
a
court
question
and
there
have
been
in
number
of
recoveries
because
priorities
are
set
out
clearly
and
there
is
nothing
for
the
cab
to
do.
assuming
that
the
priorities
that
you
have
are
fair
and
if
you
have
violated
your
priorities
then
you
can
recover
in
court.
just
as
he
maybe
able
to
recover
on
the
remand
of
the
other
section
of
the
case
because
if,
you
know,
we
obviously
claim
we
followed
our
priorities
but
if
we
were
wrong--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
you
do
if
the
question
that
is
involved
is
whether
a
particular
safety
regulation
for
example,
was
in
effect
or
was
violated
or
an
issue
as
to
a
regulation
relating
to
safety,
if
as
soon
as
that
becomes
involved,
the
whole
case
does
not
go
to
the
cab
or
in
that
case
the
faa.
but
that
section
interpreting
the
safety
regulation
is
then
shifted
to
the
faa
for
determination
for
its
interpretation
of
that
safety
regulation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
sir
that
is
what
--
that
is
what
the
whole
line
of
primary
jurisdiction
cases
that
you
have
established
says
and
that
is
not
anyone
of
this
cases
where
you
get
into
an
interpretation
of
a
board
or
agency’s
regulations
or
rules
that
instead
of
the
court
deciding
it,
it
should
be
set
to
the
agency
if
the
agency
has
not
here
before
it
decided
the
question.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
negligence
claims?
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
the
--
there
are
couples
of
exculpatory
cases
your
honor.
there
are
--
let
me
just
give
you
an
example
of
the
type
of
case
that
have
been
referred
to
agencies
or
thrown
out.
you
had
the
lichten
case
is
the
--
it
is
in
our
brief,
is
the
most
--
the
one
that
seems
most
obvious
where
there
was
a
common
law
claim
and
where
in
fact
there
was
nothing
specific
giving
the
board
jurisdiction
and
yet
in
which
it
--
that
that
was
a
case
involving
the
jury
on
a
plane
with
--
that
was
delivered
to
the
wrong
person.
and
the
court
ruled
that
the
cab
tariff
controlled
and
that
the
passengers
assume
the
risk
unless
the
carrier
was
specifically
notified
of
the
jury.
now
otherwise,
that
would
have
been
a
clear
case
of
a
common
law
recovery
and
there
was
nothing
specific
that
gave
the
cab
jurisdiction
in
that
case
and
yet
they
said
that
--
that
was
a
matter
which
did
come
into
the
cab.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
what
happened
sir,
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
hear
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
but
that
has
been
remanded.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
that
is
precisely
whether
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
as
it
did.
it
said,
first
of
all
that
overbooking
was
not
per
se
illegal
and
secondly,
therefore
the
only
question
that
was
properly
up
was
whether
the
priority
rules
had
in
fact
been
followed
and
that
--
and
there
was
dispute
about
that
and
therefore
it
was
sent
back
for
determination
of
that
single
question.
so
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
way
it
did
on
the
first
--
on
the
federal
cause
of
action.
i
mean
you
are
asking
me
to
assume
a
result
which
i
would
say
would
be
wrong
under
my
theory,
mr.
justice.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
of
a
federal
law
that
we
have
violated,
well,
of
course
our
claim
is--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
well,
but
that
would
be
a
section
404
claim.
that
would
be
claim
of
unjust
discrimination
and
so
forth
under
404.
that
would
be,
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
overbooking
but
that
when
the
man
turned
up,
there
were
three
people
waiting,
we
let
the
wrong
person
honor,
we
took,
did
not
take
the
right
person
off
the
plane.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
the
priorities
have
absolutely
nothing
to
with
the
notice
issue
that
is
in
the
front
of
the
court
now
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all.
priorities
has
to
do
with
whether
if
you
have
more
over,
more
than
one
over
sale,
how
you
are
going
to
treat
them.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether,
since
he
claims
that
he
was
entitle
to
notice
and
the
cab
has
been
working
with
this
issue
and
dealing
with
it
and
deciding
not
to
tell
a
carrier
to
give
notice.
in
fact,
absolutely,
doing
away
with
the
proposed
rule
that
would
have
required
us
to,
whether
you
do
not
turn
to
the
cab
in
the
first
instance
and
say,
number
one,
have
you
decided
in
the
past
and
already
back
in
67,
that
not
giving
notice
is
proper,
or
if
you
have
never
decided
this
question
give
us
your,
at
best
advise
now
as
to
how
you
would
decide
prospectively
because
that
would
aid
us
in
this
case.
that
is
precisely
the
line
of
cases
that
you
have
had
here
in
so
many
instances
where
you
--
this
is
a
precisely
the
kind
of
question
that
is
referred
to
the
board
for
its
expertise
and
in
order
to
avoid
conflict.
now,
may
i
just
present
to
you
on--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
would
take
this
position
your
honor,
that
if
they
say
that
not
because
of
all
of
the
considerations,
the
balancing
considerations
that
notice
should
not
be
given,
that
that
should
strongly
influence
the
court
in
deciding
that
in
fact
there
was
no
fraudulent
misrepresentation
back
in
1972.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
would
personally
think
it
would
be
determinative
but
i
concede
that
the
court
would
have
some
role
to
play
because
it
might
decide
that,
simply
because
of
what
the
board
is
deciding
now,
it
does
not
necessarily
preclude
it
back
several
years
ago.
but
i--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
could
have
jury
trial,
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
well
of
course--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course,
i
would
take
the
position
that
this
would
really
be
a
legal
question.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
let
me
just
--
let
me
make
a
one
point
very
strongly
here
to
because
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
gotten
this
across.
and
that
is
that
you
cannot
have
a
$25
thousand
recovery
in
this
case.
and
the
cab
operating
in
the
area
that
it
thinks
it
is
operating
in
as
it
told
the
court
of
appeals,
it
thinks
it
is
operating
in
both
going
on
at
the
same
time.
the
cab
has
an
investigation
right
now
and
has
had
since
1973
into
this
whole
problem.
it
has
an
ongoing
investigation
since
the
nader
case
was
decided,
the
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
informed
the
industry
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
nader
case,
the
cab
informed
the
industry
of
the
result
and
solicited
its
views
in
the
light
of
the
ongoing
investigation
that
is
going
on
of
this
entire
business
of
overbooking
practices
and
notices
and
so
forth.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
not
here.
they
did
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they
filed
amicus
brief
supporting,
fully
supporting
us
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
saying
that
they
thought
that
they
had
primary
jurisdiction
in
this
area.
now
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
no.
they
--
what
they
did
was
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
they
detailed
everything
that
had
gone
on
in
this
extraordinary
number
of
orders
and
backing
and
filling
on
this
entire
problem
and
the
regulations
that
they
have
and
how
they
worked
the
denied
boarding
compensation
out
in
the
notice--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
both,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
they
said
they
had
primary
jurisdiction
and--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
can
easily
be
supplied
to
the
court.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
you
see
what
--
what
that
means
your
honor
is
that
there
are
two
types
of
cases
that
are
kind
of
left
over.
one
is
the
fitzgerald
type
case
where
an
airline
denies
boarding
to
a
passenger
solely
on
the
basis
of
race.
now
there
is
no
way
that
the
cab
can
approve
that.
there
is
nothing
to
refer
to
the
cab.
that
is
a
racial
discrimination
case.
you
go
into
court
and
you
can
recover.
therefore
there
is
no
primary
jurisdiction
on
that
kind
of
case.
another
kind
of
case
would
be
the
priorities
case
that
is
if
you
have
violated
your
priorities,
there
is
nothing
to
go
the
cab
about.
therefore,
you
can
choose
to
turn
down
your
denied
boarding
compensation
and
go
in
and
get
higher
damages
than
you
would
get
under
denied
boarding
compensation
because
they
have
violated
their
priorities.
if
those
kinds
of
things
that
are
still
left
over
and
that
is
the
reason
why
some
passengers
turn
down
the
denied
boarding
compensation.
there
is
a
recent
case
before
judge
gazelle,
for
example,
where
apparent
pelagic
was
denied
entrance
to
an
airplane
because
he
did
not
have
somebody
with
him
and
that
the
cab
has
not
dealt
in
anyway
with
that
problem
and
therefore
that
presumably
would
not
have
to
be
--
go
to
the
cab.
but
the
point
i
have
to
drive
home--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
it
is
thought
that
it
should
have
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
to
decide
what
the
correct
practices
should
be.
to
give
the
court
its
judgment--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
cannot
go
that
far.
my
memory
does
not
serve
me
best
to
tell
you
whether
they
went
that
far
but
what
they
did
say
was
that
they
were
avidly
involved
into
this
entire
problem.
there
were
an
ongoing
investigations
that
they
should
have
a
hand
at
least
in
giving
the
court
the
best
advice
that
they
could
about
what
the
practices
should
be.
but
again
if
i
can
just
say
one
word
and
that
is,
i
want
to
emphasize
that,
so
that
you
know
what
you
do
here
when
you
allow
a
$25
thousand
award.
you
are
not
only
allowing
that
but
you
are
eliminating
overbooking.
the
cab
has
said
so.
you
are
eliminating
overbooking
and
i
think
that
you
are
placing
yourself
with
all
due
respect
right
in
this--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
no.
but
what
i
am
saying
is--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
saying
that
if
you
allow
them
the
option
of
trying
for
punitive
damages
and
getting
this
kind
of
award,
you
are
doing
away
with
overbooking
and
as
i
say
with
great
respect
you
are
putting
yourselves,
i
think
in
the
shoes
of
the
cab
because
that
is
a
cab
decision
and
not
your
decision.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
answer
sir
is
certainly
would
do
away
with
a
claim
of
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
but
i
think
the
problem
from
the
airline
industry's
standpoint
is
that
that
right
now
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
multiple
booking
going
on.
people
make
reservations
on
any
number
of
flights
and
they
only
take
one
if
they
take
any.
and--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
he
had
been
bumped
twice
before.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
asked
him.
but
i
think
that
they
would
tremendously
exacerbate
that
problem.
it
would
result
in
many
more
multiple
reservations
than
we
have
got
and
this
as
i
say
is
precisely
why
the
cab
is
allowing
overbooking
in
the
first
place
trying
to
get
away
from
the
multiple--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
have
not
either
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
of
course
the
point
i
think
you
are
trying
to
make
is
if
you
gave
people
notice,
i
mean,
if
you
are
just
going
to
give
them
a
formal
notice
to
get
away
from
your
fraudulent
misrepresentation
claim
that
is
one
thing.
but
if
you
are
going
to
put
up
a
big
sign
and
say
we
do
not
really
confirm
the
space
because
you
may
not
get
on
the
plane.
if
you
do
not
think
that
is
going
to
have
an
impact
in
terms
of
people
taking
trains
or
making
multiple
reservations
or
having
no-shows,
why,
you
are
just
wrong
and
that
is
what
the
cab
is
saying
and
that
is
what
they
are
fighting
with.
it
is
not
an
easy
problem
they
have
got.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh!
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely.
i
will
certainly
will.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
just
one
brief
clarification
your
honor.
on
the
1967
proposal,
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out,
i
have
submitted
to
the
court
a
set
of
the
relevant
cab
materials
for
your
convenience.
i
have
obliged
there
with
the
ten
sets--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
ten
sets
applied
are
with
the
clerk
so
that
if
you
want
to
look
at
these
documents
that
are
sometimes
hard
to
find.
this
was
a
rulemaking
called
edr-95
and
that
did
not
contemplate
a
general
warning
to
be
given
to
all
passengers.
what
it
was
talking
about
was
that
the
airlines
would
have
to
figure
out
12
hours
ahead
of
time
every
flight
that
was
likely
to
be
overbooked,
that
was
overbooked
to
that
time.
and
that
it
would
have
to
call
up
every
passenger,
sometimes
long
distance
to
warn
them
that
they
might
be
bumped
and
the
airlines
said
they
simply
could
not
do
that.
they
did
not
have
the
data
processing
capacity.
they
did
not
have
the
personnel,
it
would
involve
millions
of
calls
every
year
and
it
would
be
enormously
costly.
the
cab
had
noted
that
every
airline
said
that
they
recognized
on
their
own
the
obligation
to
give
a
warning
and
the
purpose
in
this
rulemaking
was
simply
to
regularize
those
procedures.
cab,
finally
concluded
that
it
did
not
need
to
regularize
those
procedures
at
the
clasp
of
such
flexibility.
that
is
at
edr-95
page
4.
so
i
do
not
think
we
are
talking
about
the
same
kind
of
thing
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
have
wondered
about
that
a
great
deal
--
your
honor.
i
cannot
draw
any
conclusion
one
way
or
the
other
i
am
--
