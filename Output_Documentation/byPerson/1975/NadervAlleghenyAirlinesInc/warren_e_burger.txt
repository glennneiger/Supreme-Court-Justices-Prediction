chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-455,
nader
against
allegheny
airlines.
mr.
robertson,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
robertson,
this
is
not
relevant
to
this
case
but
the
reason,
airlines
bump
people
is
because
a
lot
of
people
who
make
reservations
do
not
show.
they
tried
for
awhile
to
impose
a
penalty
for
that.
it
did
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
civil
aeronautics
board--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no-shows,
who
were
penalized
do
not
like.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
suspect
that
there
were
a
no-show
program
penalty,your
client
would
like
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
enough
to
spoil
your
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
you
are
saying
in
affect
permeating
your
whole
case
is
the
idea
that
people
who
travel
on
airlines
more
than,
once
or
twice
in
their
lives
do
not
all
ready
know
all
of
this
as
a
practical
matter,
that
is--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
something
in
the
nature
of
an
assumption
to
risk
defense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
something,
i
had
to
wait
--
i
read
the
papers
but
i
did
not
know
mr.
nader
got
bumped
until
i
read
the
pleadings
in
this
case
or
until
petition
for
cert,
i
guess
was
filed.
do
you
not
think
most
people
who
knew
about
this
problem
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
one
thing
that
remains
to
be
tried.
the
assumption
of
risk
idea
i
suppose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
undertake
to
show
evidence
that,
i
do
not
know
how
they
do
it
but
they
might--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
poll
of
passengers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
say
that
proposition
in
other
terms
i
suppose,
more
simple
terms,
that
the
board
might
say
that
the
across
the
whole
range
of
this
problem,
a
doctrine
of
assumption
of
risk
is
written
into
the
implied
contract
between
the
passenger
and
the
carrier.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
change
that
and
say
hereafter,
could
the
board
say
by
promulgating
a
rule
of
some
kind
that
passengers
assume
the
risk
of
being
one,
mechanical
failure
that
cancels
the
flight,
two,
being
bumped
because
of
overbooking
and
three,
whatever
the
other
reasons
may
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
to
block
a
common
law
suit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
us--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
responses
to
these
questions
conflict
with
an
announcement
by
the
cab
to
the
public
generally
that
it
was
approving
the
overbooking
practice
which
is
pretty
close
to
what
they
have
done,
or
at
least
they
have
not
done
it.
what
quarrel
do
you
have
with
that
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
very
clear
on
what
is
your
position
was
about
that.
you
said
they
can
do
that
all
right
but
they
cannot
take
away
any
common
law
action
that
you
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
bring
in
perhaps
something
like
an
assumption
of
risk--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
there
was
if
it
said
you
are
hereby
notified
that
you
might
be
bumped
and
if
you
are
bumped
there
will
be
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
carrier.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
prettyman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
also
want
to
conserve
themselves
to
the
privilege
of
not
showing
up
and
not
being
penalized
for
it
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
other
side
of
that
coin,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
responded,
i
will
not
call
it
a
concession
but
he
responded
certainly
not
negatively
that
if
the
tickets,
the
airline
ticket
on
the
back
said
something
to
the
effect
--
that
there
is
one
chance
in
a
hundred
or
maybe
two
chances
in
hundred
if
they
wanted
to
be
safe
that
you
will
not
be
accommodated
as
a
passenger
on
the
flight
covered
by
this
ticket
either
because
of
mechanical
failure,
bad
weather
or
overbooking.
and
now
it
cannot
be
that
simple
if
that
would
solve
this
problem,
i
should
think
it
would
have
been
done.
what
is
the
flaw
in
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
whether
he
had
ever
done
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
had
made
multiple
reservations
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
that
most
people
read
their
tickets,
i
have
been
traveling
on
airlines
since
they
began,
i
have
never
read
a
ticket
yet,
i
do
not
know
what
is
on
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
robertson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
let
the
record
show
that.
mr.
prettyman
does
not
agree
with
you.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-455,
nader
against
allegheny
airlines
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
