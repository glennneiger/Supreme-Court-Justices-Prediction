justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
he
get
this
compensation
and
he
is
bumped,
does
not
the
board
require
that
he
be
advised
that
the
compensation
is
in
lieu
of
common
law
remedies
which
he
might
otherwise
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
public
be
told,
you
mean
a
general
message
or
notification
of
people
with
reservation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
cab
certainly
has
some
authority
to
regulate
safety
conditions
on
airplane,
does
that
mean
that
before--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay
the
faa,
does
that
mean
that
before
a
passenger
can
sue
an
airline
as
a
result
of
an
aviation
disaster
he
has
to
first
present
his
claim
to
the
cab?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
the
federal
law
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
am
asking
you
whether
in
order
to
maintain
a
state
law
claim
for
negligence
against
an
airline
as
a
result
of
a
disaster,
you
have
to
first
go
to
the
cab
and
see
if
they
approve
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
well
established
in
the
case,
i
have
not
realize
that.
