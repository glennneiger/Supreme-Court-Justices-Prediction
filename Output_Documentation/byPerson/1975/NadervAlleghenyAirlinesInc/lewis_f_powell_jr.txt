justice

so
mr.
nader
testified
on
the
stand
that
if
he
had
known
there
was
fraction
of
1%
as
a
matter
of
probabilities
that
he
would
be
bumped,
that
he
would
not
have
taken
his
flight?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
not
a
fair
question
but
if
you
ever
heard
of
anybody
who
declined
to
fly
on
an
airplane
because
of
that
probability?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

(inaudible).
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
opinion
below
indicated
that
4.5
people
out
of
10,000.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
odds
are
not
bad,
are
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
petitioner,
ralph
nader,
had
reserved
a
seat
on
allegheny
airlines
to
fly
to
hartford.
he
arrived
to
check
in
five
minutes
before
departure
time,
but
found
that
all
seats
on
the
flight
were
occupied.
in
the
familiar
terminology
of
air
travel,
petitioner
was
bumped.
this
resulted
from
the
then
practice
of
allegheny
and
other
domestic
airlines
of
overbooking
at
least
on
many
flights.
petitioner
instituted
suit
claiming
damages
on
account
of
alleged
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
petitioner
had
not
been
advised
in
the
filed
tariffs
or
otherwise
of
the
overbooking
practice
and
the
resulting
possibility
of
being
bumped.
it
was
acknowledged
that
this
possibility
was
relatively
remote
statistically.
the
1972
average
for
all
domestic
airlines
was
slightly
more
than
one
chance
in
2000
of
a
particular
passenger
being
bumped.
the
airlines
are
subject
to
extensive
regulation
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
although
the
board
was
fully
familiar
with
the
overbooking
practice,
it
had
never
been
firmly
authorized
or
expressly
approved.
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
decided
that
petitioners
tort
action
should
be
stayed
to
afford
the
board
an
opportunity
to
consider
whether
failure
to
disclose
overbooking
is
a
deceptive
practice
under
section
411
of
the
federal
aviation
act.
we
conclude
for
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
that
there
is
no
incompatibility
between
the
maintaining
of
a
common
law
tort
action
and
the
exercise
of
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
board.
indeed,
we
think
this
is
clear
from
section
1106
of
the
act.
we
therefore
hold,
reversing
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
stay
of
petitioner's
suit
is
inappropriate.
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
