unknown
speaker
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
could
i
just
pose
this
question.
as
i
understood,
neither
judge
fay
nor
the
majority
actually
decided
whether
they
are
was
a
common
law
cause
of
action,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
the
court
followed
--
just
to
get
your
request
in
mind
that
if
you
should
prevail
the
relief
you
ask
is
that
the
matter
be
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
under
the
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
judgment
was
--
the
ruling
was
not
that
you
could
not
get
a
judgment
under
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
what
the
facts
turn
out
to
be?
unknown
speaker
but
the
board
had
the
power
to
order
the
airline
to
behave
just
the
way
it
did
here.
unknown
speaker
they
had
the
power
to
authorize
the
airline
or
order
the
airline
to
establish
a
no-show
policy?
unknown
speaker
including
overbooking?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
complaint.
i
just
wondered
if
you
thought
the
board
had
the
power
to
order
to
the
airline
to
overbook.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
has
the
board
addressed
the
question
of
whether
that
program
should
be
announced
to
the
public
or--
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
if
anybody
read
the
tariff
would
you
know
that
you
might
--
that
there
might
be
overbooking?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
in
addition
to
the
tariff?
unknown
speaker
what
specifically
--
what
misrepresentation
was
judge
fay
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
court
of
appeals
call
that
non-representation,
i
think
that--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
does
a
record
show
what
did
the
--
what
the
percentages
of
--
in
terms
of
a
hundred
passengers
or
a
thousand
passengers
in
one
day
are
bumped?
unknown
speaker
the
chance
is
greater
of
being
bumped
than
they
are
that
the
flight
will
not
fly
for
mechanical
or
some
other
reasons.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
we
are
talking
about
here.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
position
is
that
as
an
original
matter
of
a
kind
of
consideration
that
justice
powell
is
questioning
about,
should
be
addressed
by
the
common
law
jurisdiction,
that
is
deciding
whether
or
not
this
was
in
fact
deceptive,
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
might
decide
contrary
to
judge
richie
that
this
was
not
really
deceptive
but
that
--
at
any
rate
you
want
it
free
to
make
that
decision
on
the
basis
of
fraud
law
rather
than
preemption
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
robertson,
by
analogy
to
your
anti-trust
example,
supposing
the
board
that
--
your
theory
of
fraud
is
a
non-representation,
failure
disclosed,
supposing
the
board
issued
an
order
saying,
do
not
disclose
because
their
conflicting
interest
is
at
stake
and
it
would
be
harmful
to
do
it.
then
what
about
the
rational
of
the
parker
against
brown
case
that
the
airlines
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
obey
the
order
and
therefore
it
would
be
somewhat
unfair
to
hold
them
liable
as
a
matter
of
common
law.
unknown
speaker
that
it
must
not
disclose--
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
is
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
if
it
did
given
such
a
power,
well,
you
have
just
answer
that.
that
is
a
different
case.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
to
answer
--
you
do
not
have
meet
that.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
we
put
a
sign
on
the
camera
like
they
have
the
liability
on
baggage
which
thinks
the
decision
in
mind
they
have
to
do,
would
that
be
satisfactory?
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
satisfied
with
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
mere
inclusion
in
the
tariff
would
be
sufficient
in
your
opinion.
unknown
speaker
if
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
is
approved
precisely
that
kind
of
a
tariff
in
that
eastern
airlines
plan?
unknown
speaker
reservation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nader
got
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
he
had
a
confirmed
reservation
when
he
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that,
you
assert
that
cab
has
power
to
regulate
this
practice
and
to
insulate
the
airlines
from
these
sort
of
actions.
i
think
that
think
it
does.
unknown
speaker
and
then,
do
you
think
enough
has
happened
so
that
these
kinds
of
actions
may
not
be
maintained.
unknown
speaker
if
all
the
court
did
was
to
say
that,
well,
the
cab
might
be
able
to
do
that
but
it
has
not
done
it
yet
and
you
certainly
have
not
run
and
driven
any
holes
through
the
civil
aeronautics
board
or
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
unknown
speaker
cab
turned
around
on
that
sort
of
an
approach
--
the
cab
could
turn
around
tomorrow
and
make
it
clear,
if
it
had
the
power
to
do
it
as
you
say
it
does
that
the
airlines
must
do
this
and
that
we
are
preempting
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
does
that
not
read
section
1106
right
out
of
this?
unknown
speaker
it
came
from
and
maybe
boilerplate
but
it
does
say
something
and
it
must
be--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
it
is
quite
a
different
case
than
this.
unknown
speaker
it
in
not
different
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
is
induced
by
the
airlines,
is
it
not?
they
do
not
want
penalize
no-show.
unknown
speaker
mr.
prettyman,
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a
minute.
you
are
saying
that
this
is
just
what
mr.
nader
is
asking
for.
as
i
understand
of
what
the
cab
was
talking
about
there
was
notification
of
individual
passengers
who
had
reservations
within
the
12
hour,
24
hour
period
and
what
mr.
naderâ€™s
argument
is
that
the
airlines
are
by
implication
of
representing
that
there
is
no
problem
to
the
general
public
that
a
confirmed
reservation
means
just
that.
unknown
speaker
i
think
those
two
could
stand
consistently
with
one
another.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
about
over
--
do
they--
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
do
they
to
tell
how
--
that
does
not
airline
tell
the
board
how
it
as
an
airline
as
calculating
its
overbookings?
unknown
speaker
an
airlines
might
be
reasonable
about
it
and
others
might
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
they
are
being
reasonable
unless
the
airline
tells
them.
unknown
speaker
report
every
month
the
fellows
who
are
left
at
the
gate.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
they
did
not
tell
them
to
overbook.
unknown
speaker
no
airlines
is
in
violation
of
any
order
of
the
cab
if
it
does
not
overbook.
unknown
speaker
no.
if
it
does
not
overbook.
unknown
speaker
no
airlines
is
in
violation
to
cab,
any
cab
order
if
it
overbooks
and
tells
people
it
is.
unknown
speaker
so
are
the
cab
left
the
airlines
on
their
own
in
this
is
respect,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
to
tell
them,
it
is
just
that
the
--
the
opposition's
position
is
that
you
may
have
to
pay
a
judgment
down
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
prettyman,
may
i
just
interrupt?
unknown
speaker
your
whole
argument
proceeds
on
the
premise
as
i
understand
it
that
overbooking
really
is
at
stake
in
this
case.
is
it
not
entirely
possible
that
we
could
reverse
and
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
would
find
there
is
no
common
law
of
fraud
by
reason
of
the
failure
to
disclose?
unknown
speaker
have
you
conceded
that
there
is
a
common
law
of
fraud.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
correct.
that
is
not
necessarily
true
that
the
kind
of
notice
you
are
describing
is
at
issue
but
merely
you
would
have
an
obligation
to
give
sufficient
notice
to
have
a
defense
to
a
common
law
fraud
action.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
you
hit
on
every
ticket,
you
would
have
one
chance
out
of
10,
000,
if
you
do
not
get
there
15
minutes
early,
that
you
may
be
bumped,
something
like
that.
that
would
be
--
probably
an
adequate
defense
even
though
it
would
not
be
the
kind
of
notice
that
you
are
saying
he
wants.
unknown
speaker
but
does
it
enter
it
with
respect
to
the
question
that
we
have
to
decide
that
was
presented
by
the
certiorari
petition.
unknown
speaker
i
know
he
is
claiming
but
you
certainly
are
not
admitting
that
that
is
the
only
kind
of
notice
that
would
be
an
adequate
defense
to
a
common
law
fraud
case,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well.
unknown
speaker
but
are
there
primary
jurisdiction
cases
involving
negligence
claims?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
familiar
with
it
neither.
unknown
speaker
not
in
anti-trust
cases
i
know
that
of
--.
unknown
speaker
suppose
mr.
prettyman,
the
--
the
claim
under
federal
law,
under
the
federal
statute
is
sustained
eventually
and
that
i
suppose
the
--
would
you
simply
--would
it
be
fair
to
conclude
if
that
happened
that
--
unknown
speaker
that
the
claim
under
federal
law
is
sustained.
was
not
there
not
a
judgment
in
the
district
court
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
let
us
assume
ultimately
it
is
sustained.
or
let
us
assume
that
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
it.
would
it
be
fair
to
conclude
from
that
not
only
is
the
fraud
--
was
deterred
to
conclude
that
that
--
that
the
federal
law
would
not
protect
this
kind
of
action
from
a
fraud,
state
fraud
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
it
just
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
awfully
difficult
thing
to
claim
that
you
are
protected
from
a
state
cause
of
action,
because
of
a
federal
law
that
you
have
violated.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
you
have
violated
the
priorities?
unknown
speaker
in
the
anti-trust
area
sometimes,
an
agency
has
the
power
to
insulate
you
from
anti-trust
judgment
as
long
as
you
do
things
in
the
right
way
but
if
you
do
them
on
the
wrong
way
or
you
can
get
sued
under
the
anti-trust
law.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
was
correct
and
that
this
now
goes
to
cab
and
the
cab
says
no,
we
have
never
decided
this
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
but
now
that
you
ask
us,
we
think
we
will
probably
decide
it
in
the
future
and
we
can
tell
you
now
that
we
will
hold
that
not
giving
notices
--
notice
is
all
right.
and
then,
would
it
be
your
submission
that
that
ends
this
claim
that
that
is
an
absolute
defense.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
judge
would
--
then
the
judge
would
not
have
much
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
that
was
a
jury
question?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
had
informed
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
the
cab
has
not
filed
anything
here,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
context
with
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
saying
what?
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
also
say
that
this
is
what
we
meant
all
along?
unknown
speaker
that
they
want
them
--
maybe
have
a
new
swing
at
it.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
address
both
the
common
law
issue
and
the
statutory
issue?
unknown
speaker
in
both.
unknown
speaker
is
there--
unknown
speaker
in
the
court
of
appeals
brief
in
the
record,
i
wonder.
unknown
speaker
did
they
complain,
what
they
meant
about
saying
that
you
could
keep
your
common
law
remedies
if
you
did
not
take
that
denied
boarding
compensation?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
indicate
what
should
happen
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
to,
i
mean
on
the
--
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
indicate
that
furthermore
if
we
decide
the
correct
practice
should
be
no
notice
that
therefore
there
is
no
cause
of
action
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
$25,000
is
dependent
on
punitive
damage
recovery.
unknown
speaker
which
is
still
another
hurdle
that
they
--
conceding
they
are
entitled
to
punitive
damages
--.
unknown
speaker
as
they
have
a
$25,000
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
prettyman,
could
you
conveniently
arrange
to
have
the
members
of
the
courts
supplied
with
the
copies
of
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
applied
by
the
cab
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
mr.
robertson
do
you
know
why
the
cab
is
not
here?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
or
did
they
come
in
by
themselves?
