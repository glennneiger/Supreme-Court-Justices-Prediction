justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
is
a
citizen
suit
brought
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
that
act
makes
it
unlawful
to
discharge
pollutants
into
navigable
waters
without
a
permit
issued
by
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
nuclear
waste
materials
subject
to
regulation
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
its
successor
agencies
are
pollutants
within
the
meaning
of
the
water
act.
we
hold
that
they
are
not.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
regulation
of
these
nuclear
waste
materials
is
controlled
exclusively
by
the
terms
of
the
atomic
energy
act.
so
as
the
talk
reveals
out
to
the
contrary,
the
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
