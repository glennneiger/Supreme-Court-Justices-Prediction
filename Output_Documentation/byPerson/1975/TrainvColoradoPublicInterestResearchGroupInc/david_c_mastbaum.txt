mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
is
a
systematic
and
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
designed
to
restore
and
maintain
our
nation’s
vital
water
resources,
every
industrial
category
and
indeed
every
energy
facility
in
this
country
is
subject
to
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
and
at
the
present
time,
every
nuclear
facility
including
those
subject
to
regulation
on
the
atomic
energy
act
must
obtain
a
permit
pursuant
to
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act.
what
petitioner
seeks
is
to
exclude
aea
regulated
materials
that
is
radioactive
materials
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act
from
the
existing
permits
that
nuclear
facilities
must
obtain
pursuant
to
the
water
act.
i
would
like
to
make
three
points
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
the
objectives
and
purposes
of
the
water
act
as
well
as
the
expressed
statutory
language
clearly
mandate
that
all
radioactive
materials
must
be
regulated
pursuant
to
that
act.
second,
that
when
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
is
considered
fully
and
in
context,
it
clearly
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
all
radioactive
materials
be
regulated
pursuant
to
the
water
act.
and
third,
that
the
pre-emption
involved
in
the
northern
states
power
decision
has
no
bearing
on
issues
which
are
presented
for
review
today.
the
strategy
of
the
water
act
was
to
create
specific
limits
on
the
amount
of
pollutants
that
could
be
discharged
into
our
nation’s
water.
to
this
end,
the
act
gives
the
epa,
the
sole
responsibility
to
set
effluent
limitations
and
specifically
states
that
other
federal
permitting
and
licensing
agencies
must
accept
the
epa
limitations
and
cannot
set
any
of
their
own.
the
water
act
specifically
defines
several
terms
which
indicate
that
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
regulate
all
radioactive
materials.
thus
the
act
specifically
defines
pollutant
to
include
radioactive
materials
without
limitation
or
exception.
further,
the
act
defines
pollution.
pollution
includes
and
this
is
very
important,
the
man-made
or
man-induced
alteration
of
the
radiological
integrity
of
water.
third,
the
act
prohibits
the
discharge
of
high
level
radioactive
waste
and
radiological
warfare
agents.
both
of
these
materials
are
exclusively
regulated
by
the
atomic
energy
act.
and
fourth,
the
act
states
that
nuclear
steam-electric
generating
plants
are
subject
to
its
regulation.
fifth,
the
act
regulates
toxic
pollutants
and
hazardous
materials
and
indeed
is
undisputed
that
as
these
terms
are
used
in
the
water
act,
radioactive
materials
would
be
toxic
pollutants
and
hazardous
materials.
the
definition
of
pollutant
and
pollution
are
central
to
the
water
act
for
as
these
terms
determine
the
scope
of
the
act.
congress
recognized
the
importance
of
these
terms
representative
blatnik
(ph)
a
member
of
the
fwpca’s
conference
committee
made
the
point
succinctly,
the
total
utility
of
the
bill
is
reflected
in
the
definition
of
the
term
pollutant,
pollution,
point-source,
discharge
and
toxic
pollutant.
to
revise
any
of
these
definitions
is
to
upset
the
common
thread
of
the
bill.
if
there
is
a
part
of
this
bill
that
can
be
labeled
most
important
is
these
definitions
to
revise
them
in
a
way
to
limit
their
coverage
is
to
severely
detract
from
the
effectiveness
of
the
bill.
moreover,
these
critical
definitions
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
act
received
microscopic
scrutiny
from
congress.
the
final
bill
was
subject
to
a
three-month
conference
in
which
the
conference
committee
met
39
times
and
according
to
senator
muskie,
the
conference
committee
tried
to
write
into
expressed
language
as
clearly
as
possible,
the
intent
of
congress
and
not
leave
final
evaluation
of
the
bill
to
legislative
history.
thus,
the
definition
of
pollutant
includes
radioactive
materials
without
exception
or
limitation.
the
natural
meaning
of
this
term
in
both
its
popular
usage
and
in
a
technical
sense
has
always
meant
all
radioactive
materials.
indeed,
the
nrcs
own
regulations
define
radioactive
materials
as
any
such
material
whether
or
not
subject
to
licensing
controlled
by
the
commission.
this
is
found
in
10
cfr
section
20.3
13.
furthermore,
the
definition
of
pollutant
contains
specific
exceptions
from
the
term.
this
court
has
reaffirmed
on
numerous
occasions
that
when
a
statutory
phrase
contains
specific
limitations
or
exceptions,
no
further
exceptions
are
to
be
applied.
moreover,
the
exemption
which
the
government
is
seeking
in
this
court
would
render
the
fwpca’s
reference
to
radioactive
materials
virtually
meaningless
for
the
vast
majority
of
radioactive
materials
are
discharged
into
water
are
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act.
nothing
is
left
by
comparison.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
whenever
congress
has
utilized
a
term,
radioactive
materials,
and
other
legislation,
what
it
has
intended
to
include
all
radioactive
materials,
it
has
just
utilize
the
term.
when
it
has
intended
to
exclude
those
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act,
it
has
said
so
in
expressed
language.
the
intent
of
congress
to
include
all
radioactive
materials
within
the
water
act
is
further
found
in
the
definition
of
pollutant.
the
act
defines
pollution
as
a
man-made
or
man-induced
alteration
of
the
radiological
integrity
of
water.
radioactive
materials
regulate
under
the
atomic
energy
act
are
all
man-made
or
man-induced.
therefore,
this
was
the
precise
type
of
pollution
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
defined
pollution
to
mean
man-made
or
man-induced
alteration
of
the
radiological
integrity
of
water.
since
radioactive
materials
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act
constitute
the
vast
majority
of
radioactive
materials
discharged
into
water,
the
exclusion
would
render
meaningless.
the
congressional
intent
to
protect
the
radiological
integrity
of
water.
in
summary,
the
language
of
the
act
reflects
a
consistent
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
regulate
all
radioactive
materials.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
submit
that
resort
to
legislative
history
is
unnecessary
and
unwarranted.
however,
since
the
government
places
such
heavy
reliance
on
it,
we
will
present
the
legislative
history
in
context.
the
government
utilizes
the
legislative
history
in
the
case
of
bar
to
create
not
to
solve
ambiguity.
it
is
our
position
that
both
the
senate
bill
and
the
conference
committee
plainly
intended
to
include
all
radioactive
materials
while
the
exemption
which
the
government
seeks
in
this
court
had
some
support
in
the
house.
it
never
obtained
the
status
of
legislative
language
and
was
specifically
rejected
by
the
conference
committee.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
mr.
justice
the
petitioners
have
cited
a
portion
of
the
house
report.
the
conference
committee
specifically
considered
the
definition
of
pollutant
and
adapted
a
new
definition
that
was
different
from
both
the
house
and
the
senate
versions.
the
house
had
included
two
additional
exceptions
to
that
definition.
these
exclusions
were
cut
out
of
the
conference
bill.
furthermore,
the
precise
language
found
in
house
report
which
excluded
radioactive
materials
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act
was
not
found
anywhere
in
the
conference
report.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
in
light
of
the
microscopic
scrutiny
that
senator
muskie
emphasized
the
conference
bill
received,
it
can
only
be
assumed
that
the
fact
that
the
conference
bill
and
the
conference
port
contains
no
statement
which
would
indicate
an
intent
to
exclude
radioactive
materials
regulated
under
the
atomic
energy
act
as
a
very
expressed
and
very
strong
rejection.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
that
is
precisely,
thus--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
that
is
right.
however--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
that
is
precisely
right,
however,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
conference
specifically
considered
the
scope
of
the
term
and
in
light
of
senator
muskie's
statement
that
the
conference
that
tried
to
writing
to
us,
clearly
as
possible
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
that
is
correct,
however–-
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
let
me
address
it
specifically.
first
by
moving
over
to
the
senate,
subsequent
to--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
i
think
it
is
necessary
for
me
in
order
to
explain
that
to
move
over
to
the
senate.
in
the
senate,
there
were
a
number
of
debates
which
indicated
that
it
was
the
intent
or
was
the
understanding
of
the
senate
members
of
the
conference,
that
all
radioactive
materials
be
included.
in
fact,
let
me
quote
you
from
senator
buckley
who
was
engaged
in
a
colloquy
with
senator
muskie.
senator
buckley
declared
himself
deeply
concerned
about
section
511(c)(2)(b).
this
clause,
may
i
understand
bar
any
federal
permitting
or
licensing
agency
such
as
aec
from
imposing
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
issuance
of
any
license
or
permit,
any
effluent
limitation
other
than
those
limitations
established
pursuant
to
the
fwpca.
now,
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
senator
buckley's
understanding
in
his
colloquy
with
senator
muskie
that
any
effluent
limitation
established
by
epa
for
any
material
would
have
to
be
accepted
by
the
aec.
now,
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
house
and
mr.
robert
zener
who
is
the
general
council
of
the
epa
and
on
the
brief
for
the
petitioners
in
the
case
at
bar
in
a
more
scholarly
moment
noted
that
the
house
in
senate
conferees
on
the
water
act
often
made
contradictory
statements
when
they
returned
to
their
respective
chambers.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
if
i
could
just
–
in
the
treaty
signed
on
federal
environment
law,
mr.
zener
analyzed
such
discrepancies
in
connection
with
section
13
and
14
of
the
water
act
as
follows.
this
is
one
of
the
many
situations
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
amendments
where
the
senate
and
house
managers
made
statements
and
the
floor
debates
which
they
apparently
cannot
agree
on
at
the
conference.
in
these
situations,
the
statements
are
dubious
as
indications
of
congressional
intent.
i
guess
that
is
the
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
that
the
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
house
are
dubious
as
--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
if
ones
in
the
senate
are
dubious,
then
i
would
rely
on
the
conference
report
which
clearly
indicates
that
there
is
no
exception.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
but
while
the
conferees
considered
the
extent
of
the
exclusions
and
the
scope
of
the
definition.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
no,
i
do
not,
what
will
occur
will
be
that
the
epa
will
have
the
sole
authority
to
set
effluent
limitations.
the
nrc
and
erda
will
have
the
authority
to
license
nuclear
facilities
and
be
responsible
for
the
operation
of
those
facilities.
their
licenses
will
merely
have
to
reflect
the
epas
standards,
established
pursuant
to
the
water
act.
there
is
no
duplication,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
will
result
in
uniformity
and
that
all
aspects
of
water
pollution
from
nuclear
facilities
will
be
subject
to
the
water
act.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
no,
that
is
not
true.
the
water
act
is
very
practical.
it
requires
that
the
epa--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
i
do
not
concede
that
there
was
silence
in
congress.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
i
also
rely
on
language
that
one
can
find
in
the
legislative
history.
for
example,
in
the
debate
that
the
government
refers
to
between
senators
pastore
and
senators
muskie
subsequent
to
discussion
on
the
consequences
of
epa
regulation
under
the
water
act.
there
was
a
discussion
on
the
setting
of
specific
effluent
limitations
from
nuclear
facilities
and
this
discussion
arose
in
the
context
of
northern
states
power
versus
minnesota.
and
that
case
as
you
know
preempted
the
states
from
regulating
radioactive
materials
that
were
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
at
that
time
it
was
adapted
20
years
early
than
the
water
pollution
control
act.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
i
do
not
concede
silence.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
you
have
not
appointed
anything
very
specific
so
far.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
if
the
exception,
it
must
be
remembered
that
what
the
government
is
seeking
to
exclude
from
the
water
act
is
a
very
significant
form
of
pollution.
if
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
those
materials,
when
they
made
specific
reference
to
them
not
only
in
definition
of
pollutant
but
in
definition
of
pollution,
they
would
have
said
so.
undoubtedly,
there
is
some
support
for
the
government’s
position
but
that
is
primarily
in
the
house.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
yes.
excuse
me.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
i
have--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act,
i
think
would
take
presence.
my
co-counsel--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
the
water
acts
specifically
states
any
agency's
authority
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
water
act
must
yield
to
the
water
act
1371.
my
co-counsel
has
just
reminded
me
that
in
the
senate
report,
there
is
a
specific
reference
to
radioactive
materials
subjected
to
the
atomic
energy
act.
that
is
in
the
discussion
of
section
1316
of
the
final
version
of
the
bill
section
306
and
the
senate
bill,
the
senate
committee
specifically
restated
that
epa’s
office
of
radiological
health
should
prepare
itself
to
regulate
nuclear
fuels
processing
plants.
well,
the
functions
of
the
office
of
radiological
health
deal
purely
with
radioactive
materials
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act
and
the
only
discharge
is
from
nuclear
fuels
processing
plants
are
those
subject
to
the
atomic
energy
act.
so
--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
if
it
was
a
verbatim,
it
is
very
closed,
it
dealt
with
new
sources
of
pollution
that
the
epa
should
regulate.
and
from
the
list
of
sources
included
in
section
306,
this
act
only
indicated
that
epa
indicated
that
it
did
not
have
the
authority
at
this
time
to
regulate
nuclear
fuel
processing
plants
but
that
it
should
develop
the
authority
as
bureau
of
radiological
health
should
prepare
to
regulate
the
discharges
of
radioactive
materials
from
these
plants.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
section
306,
the
one
i
have
been
referring
to
is
the
same
as
a
comparable
provision
of
the
senate
bill
and
the
house
amendment
so
therefore,
they
apparently
do
accept
the
senate
version.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
i
would
say
that
what
would
happen
if
this
court
affirms
the
tenth
circuit
would
be
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
would
set
effluent
limitations
for
radioactive
materials,
then
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
or
erda
would
ensure
that
facilities
subject
to
their
licensing
authority
would
meet
those
limitations--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
they
would
have
the
authority
to
regulate
those
facilities
but
they
would
not
have
the
authority--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
yes,
they
could
regulate
the
pollution
but
they
could
not
establish
the
limits.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
i
do
not
think--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
two
competing
agencies
here.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
environmental
protection.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
i
think
the
missions
and
functions
of
this--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
with
respect
to
matters
related
to
environmental
pollution,
the
epa
is
superior.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
that
is
correct
with
respect
to
water
pollution?
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
we
do
not
claim
that
there
was
any
problem
with
respect
to
that
but
the
water
act
establishes
a
new
regulatory
scheme
with
specific
effluent
limitations.
these
limitations
enforced
by
the
program
give
more
control
of
pollution.
furthermore,
their
technology
forcing,
that
is
there
was
a
phased
approach
to
pollution
control.
there
are
several
dates
which
have
been
set
far
in
advance
for
achieving
more
stringent
pollution
control
and
therefore
by
subjecting
the
nuclear
facilities
to
this
law,
we
will
have
hopefully
the
advancement
of
technology
which
will
result
in
cleaner
water.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
i
think
the
point
that
you
make
is
very
important
because
the
government
concedes
that
epa
has
responsibility
to
set
general
or
ambient
environmental
standards
for
radiation.
however--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
that
is
true.
they
are
dealing
with
the
total
number
of
plants.
the
only
way
to
effectively
reach
that
point
is
to
provide
for
specific
limitations.
the
epa
may
establish
general
in
this.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
well,
i
am
not
persuaded
that
they
would
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
my
argument
is
that
the
water
act
clearly
and
unequivocally
includes
all
radioactive
materials.
the
precise
regulatory
scheme
established
under
that
act
will
result
in
the
epa
being
able
to
achieve
a
fulfillment
of
the
general
environmental
standards
which
they
are
required
to
set.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
states
would
be
preempted
from
regulating
radioactive
materials
pursuant
to
the
water
act
has
never
a
reason
at
this
time--
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
the
role
of
the
states
would
be
one.
if
it
is
found
that
the
states
are
preempted
for
saying
effluent
limits,
the
epa
would
set
effluent
limits
and
then
as
the
states
take
over
individual
permit
programs,
they
would
include
the
epa
the
federal
limits
within
the
state
permit.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
no,
it
would
not.
in
northern
states
power,
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
states
were
preempted
under
the
atomic
energy
act.
it
is
our
position
that
under
the
water
act,
radioactive
materials
discharged
into
water
is
now
being
regulated.
therefore,
the
atomic
energy
act
has
no
bearing
on
preemption
under
the
water
act.
mr.
david
c.
mastbaum
they
would
have
a
very
limited
role
pursuant
to
a
federal
regulatory
scheme.
thank
you.
