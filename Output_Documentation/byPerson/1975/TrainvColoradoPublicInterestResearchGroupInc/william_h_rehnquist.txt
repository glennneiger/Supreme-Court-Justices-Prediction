of
course
those
two
are
not
necessary
completely
inconsistent.
anyone
could
feel
that
both
epa
and
aec
or
whatever
its
successor
is
should
both
regulate
and
still
feel
that
the
states
are
not
to
regulate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
the
same
congress
that
has
passed
the
water
act
or
was
it
the
following?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
it
was
specifically
rejected
by
the
conference
committee?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
a
little
strong
to
say
that
they
specifically
rejected
it.
is
it
not
more
accurate
to
say
that
they
came
up
with
different
language
which
did
not
include
the
house
provisions?
i
mean,
you
are
not
talking
about
for
instance
that
conference
report
that
said
the
house
bill
provided
such
and
such
but
the
conference
determined
that
we
did
not
want
the
law
to
say
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
it
can
only
be
assumed,
i
think
you
concede
some
of
what
i
am
asking
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
the
states
come
in
by
the
back
door
if
not
the
front
of
the
epa
as
given
the
authority
that
you
contend
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
water
bill.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
did
not
mean
by
preemption
but
i
meant
by
participation
in
the
epa
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
a
result
somewhat
contrary
to
the
(inaudible)
case
would
it
not
be?
the
northern
states
power
company?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
admittedly
not
direct
but
the
states
would
have
a
role
in
regulating
that
they
would
not
have
if
your
contention
were
rejected.
