unknown
speaker
rather
radioactive?
unknown
speaker
the
way
we
have
here
disavowed
by
the
epa
who
is
the
administrator
which
is
a
party
here?
unknown
speaker
the
only
parties
but
you
say
the
success
of
the
aec,
the
nrc
takes
a
quite
consistent
position
that
it
does
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
they
have
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
but
their
jurisdiction
is
exclusive?
unknown
speaker
are
they
members
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
appointed
for
a
term
of
years
or
they
removed
well
by
the
president?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
that
might
be
of
some
importance
because
a
response
to
the
argument
you
just
made
is
that
there
is
one
president
and
presumably
if
he
thinks
that
two
are
getting
out
of
coordination,
he
can
coordinate
them
by
removing
one
or
telling
one
what
to
do.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
are
fixed--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
fixed
terms.
i
supposed
under
humphrey's
executor
,
he
could
not
remove
them
just
because
they
did
not
like
what
they
were
doing?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
it
will
all
be
whatever
this
new
agency
success
for
the
atomic
energy
commission
were
to
say,
no
you
cannot
introduce
this,
and
epa
were
to
say
yes,
you
can.
it
could
have
a
conflict
between
the
two
agencies
as
particular
radioactive
material?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
the
epa
there
states
do
not
have
the
right
for
specific
source,
limitations
except
their
own?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
at
least
one
authority
can
decide
on
what
is
the
specific
source
that
may
contribute
to
the
pollution
of
the
air.
here,
the
atomic
energy
commission
wants
to
permit
the
release
of
certain
amount
of
radioactive
materials?
it
may
do
so
right
up
to
the
very
limit
of
the
epa
general
standard.
unknown
speaker
no
one
else
--
unknown
speaker
the
epa
says
there
can
only
be
a
hundred
in
the
water.
and
so
the
atomic
energy
commission
cannot
allow
specific
release
anymore
than
a
hundred.
total
came
with
it,
right?
unknown
speaker
suppose
though
that
there
are
other
sources
contributing
to
the
radioactive
pollution
of
radioactive
materials
of
the
kind,
for
example,
that
you
--
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there
can
be
no
other
sources
because
this
is
exclusively
--
do
you
say
that
there
are
other
kinds
of
radioactive
materials
that
are
not
over
which
the
aec
does
not
have?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
in
mines?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
the
only
sources
for
radioactive
materials
would
be
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
aec?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
saying
that
the
epa
may
say
that
these
ten
sources
can
only
contribute
a
hundred.
but
they
cannot
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
ten
sources
may
only
contribute
ten?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
the
fight
is
all
about?
unknown
speaker
the
conference
bill
did
not
change
the
words
of
radioactive
materials,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
the
argument
is
here
as
to
what
those
words
mean?
unknown
speaker
the
exceptions
that
were
in
the
house
report
were
the
exceptions
to
the
radioactive
materials?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
conference
report
or
the
conference
action
did
not
report
to
widen
or
limit
whatever
the
words
radioactive
materials
might
have
been.
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
statements
on
the
house
floor
after
the
conference
report,
did
mr.
anderson
not
make
the
statement
as
to
what
conference
did?
unknown
speaker
did
he
not
say
that
the
original
understanding
as
to
the
meaning
or
say
the
scope
of
radioactive
materials
had
not
been
changed?
unknown
speaker
let
us
talk
about
the
house.
let
us
talk
about
mr.
anderson.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
could
change
the
meaning
of
radioactive
materials
as
it
came
to
that?
they
did
not
change
the--
unknown
speaker
as
with
respect
to
radioactive
materials?
unknown
speaker
the
conference
report
does
not
help
you,
i
do
not
think
in
so
far
as
establishing
your
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mastbaum,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
there
will
be
duplicative
regulation
by
the
nrc
and
the
epa
that
could
be
conflicting?
unknown
speaker
and
the
nrc
authority
that
it
is
exercised
for
20
years
will
be
taken
away
from
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
authority
that
had
existed
would
be
limited
by
the
new
act.
the
nrc’s
authority
--
it
would
be
limited
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
epa
has
broad
radiation
authority
and
experienced
when
it
was
established
pursuant
to
reorganization
plan
3
of
1970.
the
federal
radiation
council
was
transferred
to
the
epa
from
the
aec
as
well
as
the
bureau
of
radiological
health
from
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare.
but
do
you
think
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
from
but
in
effect
it
is
silenced
by
congress
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
was
taking
away
from
an
agency
that
operated
for
20
years
or
some
of
its
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
rely
on
the
language
in
the
statute
itself
but--
unknown
speaker
but
did
not
the
atomic
energy
act
vest
have
the
exclusive
control
in
the
commission
of
atomic
energy?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
the
1974
act
subtracted
a
certain
portion
of
that
exclusive
control
lies
thereby
silent
so
far
as
specific
discussion
of
it
was
concerned
in
a
congressional
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
the
language
in
the
act
which
i
concede
gives
you
quite
an
arguable
position?
unknown
speaker
in
your
plain
language?
unknown
speaker
their
plain
language
argument
might
have
certain
amount
of
substance
if
there
had
not
been
the
atomic
energy
act
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
not
think
that
when
you
have
two
congressional
statutes
and
one
of
them
--
and
they
seem
to
be
clashing
or
they
seem
to
be
inconsistent,
isn't
there
some
ground
for
making
room
for
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that?
it
was
just
passed
later
but
let
as
assume
there
was
no
legislative
history
whatsoever
with
respect
to
what
the
words
radioactive
materials
meant
as
used
in
the
water
act.
but
nevertheless
you
have
another
statute
which
purports
to
give
the
atomic
energy
commission
some
of
the
same
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
with
the
section
of
the
senate
bill
that
the
senate
report
was
addressing
to
there,
was
that
carried
over
verbatim
into
the
final
bill?
unknown
speaker
but
you
criticized
the
reliance
on
the
house
committee
report
because
you
say
the
conference
committee
did
not
go
the
same
way.
now
if
you
are
going
to
rely
on
the
senate
committee
report,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
got
to
show
that
that
is
somehow
more
faithful
to
the
conference
report
or
the
conference
report
in
effect
adopts
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
the
energy
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
how
much
pollutions
are
put
in
the
water?
unknown
speaker
so
they
would
have
no
independent
authority
at
all
anymore.
unknown
speaker
there
will
be
no
authority
to
regulating
the
pollution?
unknown
speaker
so
now
you
got
congress
deliberately
setting
up
two
complete
intimations.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
congress
meant
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
you
either
have
two,
one
is
superior?
unknown
speaker
what
i
want
to
know
what
is
your
position,
is
the
epa
superior?
unknown
speaker
and
that
right
has
been
taken
away
from
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record,
any
testimony
in
support
of
the
view
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
had
failed
adequately
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
the
discharge
of
radioactive
materials
into
waters
of
our
country?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mastbaum,
what
do
you
understand
by
the
statement
in
the
government’s
brief
as
to
what
it
concedes
the
epa
would
still
be
able
to
do
even
if
the
government
wins?
thus
the
lines
of
authority
were
fairly
drawn,
epa
was
to
set
generally
applicable
radiation
standards
limiting
the
total
amount
of
permissible
radiation
in
the
environment
for
major
categories
of
sources.
now
i
assume
from
what
i
have
heard
the
government
say
that
the
epa
under
the
government’s
view
would
be
entitled
to
set
limits
on
radiation
releases
into
the
water
for
major
categories
of
sources
namely
power
plants
for
example,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
when
they
say
it
from
major
categories
of
sources,
would
not
power
plants,
would
not
the
facilities
managed
by
the
aec
be
a
major
category?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
just
making
effective
argument
but
assume
that
the
aec
after
the
general
standards
were
set
by
the
epa,
honestly
carried
out
its
task
and
limited
the
radiation
and
kept
the
radiation
release
within
the
limits
of
the
epa.
now
would
you
be
satisfied
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
argument
is
that
they
will
not
do
it?
neither
if
they
did
it,
if
they
did
do
it,
it
would
not
be
enough?
