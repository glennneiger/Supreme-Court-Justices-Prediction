mr.
randolph
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
hereon
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
issue
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation
and
we
believe
one
of
considerable
importance.
the
question
is
whether
nuclear
materials,
nuclear
waste
materials
that
are
already
comprehensively
controlled
and
regulated
by
the
success
or
agencies
to
the
autonomic
energy
commission
are
pollutants
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
order
pollution
control
act
as
amended
in
1972.
if
they
are
pollutants,
the
result
is
that
these
same
nuclear
materials
will
be
under
the
regulatory
control
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
if
one
accepts
the
arguments
of
the
fourteen
states
who
are
here
in
amicus
curiae
eventually
under
the
control
of
the
individual
states.
the
case
arises
as
a
result
of
a
suit
that
was
brought
in
october
of
1973
in
the
district
court
of
colorado
by
two
organizations
representing
college
students
and
law
students
attending
school
in
colorado
and
also
for
individual
citizens
of
the
state.
the
respondents
who
are
plaintiffs
below
saw
that
the
declaratory
judgment
in
an
injunction
against
the
epa
and
its
administrator
for
failing
to
regulate
the
particular
material,
nuclear
material
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
they
pointed
to
the
fact
that
they
were
two
nuclear
facilities
within
the
state
of
colorado.
one
was
the
fort
st.
vrain
generating
power
station
which
is
a
nuclear
reactor
gas-cooled
that
had,
at
that
time
not
been
yet
in
operation.
and
the
other
was
the
rocky
flats
plant
which
is
a
plant
that
fabricates
plutonium
for
use
in
weapons.
it
is
owned
by
the
federal
government
specifically,
the
energy
research
and
development
administration
and
run
by
a
private
company.
the
record
here
is
very,
very
sparse.
this
case
was
decided
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
actually,
it
could
have
been
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
there
were
only
two
things
outside
the
record
both
of
which
are
in
the
appendix.
there
were
only
two
exhibits
in
regard
to
draft
permits
for
the
fort
st.
vrain
generating
station.
the
district
court
granted
the
environmental
protection
agencies
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
this
was
at
the
pleading
stage.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
the
epa
had
the
responsibility
and
duty
of
regulating
the
material
in
question
here.
before
i
proceed
to
the
argument,
i
think
some
statutory
background
is
necessary
in
light
of
this
very
sparse
record.
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
conferred
upon
the
atomic
energy
commission
which
is
now
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
and
erda
complete,
extensive,
exclusive
authority
and
control
over
the
use
and
disposal
of
certain
nuclear
materials.
these
materials
fall
into
three
categories
of
substances
which
was
set
forth
in
the
footnotes
on
our
brief
at
page
20.
first
of
all
source
material.
source
material
means
materials
such
as
uranium
238
from
which
nuclear
fuel
was
extracted.
the
second
kind
of
material
that
is
involved
here
is
special
nuclear
material
such
as
fissionable
material.
it
is
uranium
233,
uranium
235
and
plutonium.
the
third
kind
of
material
in
addition
to
source
and
special
nuclear
material
is
byproduct
material.
that
means
the
material
that
is
produced
from
the
fission
process
itself
and
made
radioactive
as
a
result
of
that
process.
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
established
maximum
permissible
limits
on
the
releases
of
radioactivity
into
the
environment
by
its
licensees.
its
licenses
further
limit
to
a
minute
percentage
of
those
maximum
limits
the
amount
that
an
individual
licensee
like
the
fort
st.
vrain
generating
station
can
release
into
the
atmosphere
either
through
the
air
or
through
the
water.
and
of
course
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
licensing
procedures
that
the
nrc
conducts
are
detailed
comprehensive
and
a
great
deal
of
time,
manpower
spent
before
a
plant,
a
nuclear
generating
plan
can
even
be
constructed,
let
alone
operated.
after
it
does
get
constructed,
there
is
another
licensing
procedure
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
that
essentially
in
a
nutshell
is
what
the
atomic
energy
act
does.
the
water
act
which
was
amended
in
1972
and
in
several
important
respects,
has
as
its
basics
structure
in
regard
to
discharges
of
pollutants
into
the
water.
one
section
that
absolutely
forbids
any
discharges
of
any
pollutants
into
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
without
a
permit.
the
permit
can
be
issued
by
epa
as
it
would
have
been
the
case
in
colorado
in
1973,
when
this
case
was
started
or
if
a
state
has
adopted
pursuant
to
epa’s
approval,
a
plan
for
implementing
a
permit
program
then
the
authority
to
issue
permits
is
transferred
from
epa
to
the
state.
colorado
adapted
and
approved
plan
as
of
april
1975.
it
did
not
have
one
when
this
case
was
began.
so
the
first
point
under
the
water
act
is
that
no
discharge
of
pollutant
without
a
permit.
the
term
pollutant
is
defined
in
section
5026
of
the
water
act
to
include
radioactive
materials
and
i
put
quotations
around
that
phrase,
“radioactive
materials.”
this
leads
to
respondents
argument
which
is
essentially
set
forth
in
their
complaint
and
as
the
argument
that
was
adapted
by
the
tenth
circuit.
the
argument
is
simply
this.
source,
special
nuclear,
byproduct
materials
under
the
atomic
energy
act
are
radioactive.
no
question
about
it.
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
randolph
there
are
other
ways
of
producing
radioactive
material
and
i
am
a
not
scientific
expert
enough
to
know
what
is
more
or
less
radioactive.
there
is
accelerator
processes
which
are
not
regulated
by
the
atomic
energy
act.
but
they
are
radioactive.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
therefore
there
are
pollutants
under
the
water
act,
therefore
they
cannot
be
discharge
without
a
permit
at
the
time
from
epa
now
either
from
epa
or
the
state
of
colorado.
therefore
epa
must
regulate
the
discharge
of
the
source
or
special
nuclear
and
byproduct
material.
epa
refused
to
do
that
and
what
probably
precipitated
this
suit
is
the
regulation
of
epa
which
is
set
forth
of
page
18
of
our
brief
which
was
adapted
in
the
summer
of
1973.
in
implementing
the
water
act,
epa
repeated
the
statutory
language.
the
term
pollutant
means
radioactive
materials
discharged
into
the
water.
however,
in
a
comment,
the
administrator
of
epa
stated
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
water
act
reflects
that
the
term
radioactive
materials
is
included
in
the
definition
of
pollutant
covers,
only
radioactive
materials
which
are
not
encompassed
in
the
definition
of
source
byproduct
or
special
nuclear
materials
and
so
forth,
as
covered
by
the
atomic
energy
act.
this
legislative
history
which
is
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
brief
and
also
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
utilities
here,
which
the
administrator
relied
upon
which
respondents
urges
court
not
to
look
at
and
which
the
court
below
indicated
could
be
disregarded.
we
think
demonstrates
conclusively
the
correctness
of
epa’s
interpretation
of
this
particular
provision
in
the
water
act.
before
discussing
that
history
however,
i
would
like
to
discuss
and
stress
a
few
points
that
we
think
are
important
in
approaching
this
problem.
first
of
all,
that
of
course
on
this
record,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
in
fact
respondents
complaint
is
not
even
alleged
that
the
successor
agencies
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
are
in
any
way
improperly
failing
to
perform
their
duty
in
regard
to
the
discharge
of
nuclear
material
on
question.
they
do
not
claim
that
the
minute
amount
now
released
could
in
any
way
be
reduced
and
indeed
there
is
no
allegation
that
there
is
even
the
remotest
danger
to
the
health
or
the
environment
under
the
current
situation
of
regulation.
there
is
nothing
indeed
in
the
hearings
and
the
extensive
hearings
that
took
place
before
the
water
act
was
amended
in
1972
but
indicates
anything
in
regard
to
any
problem
whatsoever
from
the
discharged
into
the
water
from
nuclear
power
plants.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
statement
that
is
relevant
to
that
question
is
quoted
at
the
top
of
the
page
43
of
the
brief,
amicus
curiae
by
the
utilities
and
that
statement
is
from
the
testimony
of
russell
train
who
was
now
of
course
the
administrator
of
epa
and
then
was
chairman
of
the
counsel
on
environmental
quality
and
he
testified
that
the
existing
atomic
energy
commission
regulation
of
discharges
such
as
what
we
are
talking
about
from
nuclear
plants
was
rigorous
and
demanded
adherence
to
“the
highest
possible
standards.”
what
we
are
talking
about
here
in
light
of
the
atomic
energy
or
the
successors
to
the
atomic
energy
commissions
regulations
are
discharges
from
nuclear
power
plants
into
water
and
into
the
air
that
specifically
in
regard
to
the
water
cannot
exceed
5
millirems
per
person
per
year.
it
has
to
be
less
than
that.
a
rem
is
a
radioactive
dose.
i
think
the
average
person
of
the
united
states
receives
a
dose
of
500
rems.
but
to
give
the
court
an
idea
of
what
5
millirems
means,
it
means
simply
this,
that
if
you
stood
outside
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
that
was
license
and
as
they
have
to
be
by
the
nrc
and
took
your
drinking
water,
from
the
water
that
is
discharged
in
that
power
plant.
for
an
entire
year,
you
could
not
receive
a
dose
of
more
than
5
millirems
which
is
equal
to
or
less
than
the
radioactivity
that
you
would
receive
from
flying
from
washington
dc
to
denver.
secondly,
in
establishing
the
liquid
effluent
limitations
for
nuclear
power
plants,
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
must
consider
the
design
and
operation
of
the
plant.
what
comes
out
is
intermittently
related
with
how
the
plant
is
operated
and
how
it
is
designed
reducing
the
radioactivity
discharged
into
the
water
could
as
we
stated
in
our
brief
result
in
serious
problems
in
regard
to
increased
gas
emissions
or
solid
waste
emissions
and
indeed
even
safety
problems.
and
let
me
give
the
court
an
example
of
what
we
mean
by
this.
the
way
that
these
minute
fractions
of
radioactivity
get
released
at
all
is
through
an
osmosis
process.
there
are
rods
that
are
submitted
and
stuck
into
the
core
of
a
nuclear
reactor.
they
contain
the
radioactive
material.
they
are
made
generally
of
stainless
steel.
water
within
a
loop,
this
is
water
that
is
self-contained
circulates
around
those
rods
as
a
cooling
process.
other
water
flows
through
to
cool
that
water
in
the
loop.
that
is
the
water
that
generally
is
pumped
out
at
the
end
of
the
process.
the
reason
any
radioactivity
gets
out
at
all
is
because
of
a
number
of
things.
number
one
there
may
be
microscopic
faults
in
that
stainless
steel.
there
is
an
osmosis
process
where
there
is
a
transfers,
so
on
and
so
forth.
there
is
one
way
that
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
scientist
to
understand
of
stopping
that
from
happening.
and
that
is
to
increase
the
thickness
of
the
stainless
steel
rods.
increase
that,
the
osmosis
stops,
the
faults
disappear
because
of
the
thickness.
unfortunately,
what
that
would
do
is
require
one
thing.
it
will
require
the
nuclear
generating
plant
that
operate
at
a
higher
temperature.
and
second
of
all,
it
would
take
more
time
for
that
plant
to
cool
down.
if
god
forbid,
there
ever
were
an
accident
in
which
the
coolant
for
some
reason
or
another
was
not
working
properly
and
as
the
scientific
material
that
is
cited
in
all
these
briefs
indicates
the
most
dangerous
problem
in
operating
a
nuclear
power
plant
is
loss
of
coolant
because
that
is
when
a
problem
can
occur.
of
course,
the
nrc
follows
a
rule
three
generally
for
every
system
that
is
needed,
they
have
three
of
them.
everything
is
bolted
on
to
a
power
plant,
now
that
can
prevent
the
discharge
of
radioactivity
is
now
bolted
on.
but
that
gives,
i
think
the
court
an
idea
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
simply
putting
something
on
the
end
of
a
pipe.
the
filtered
out
radioactive
waste
material.
the
congress
itself
recognized
the
interrelationships
that
i
am
talking
about.
in
the
atomic
energy
act
itself,
congress
specifically
stated
that
the
nrc
was
forbidden
in
any
way
to
relinquish
its
authority
in
regulatory
control
over
the
material
we
are
talking
about.
now,
with
all
this
in
mind
and
with
the
fact
that
we
have
the
atomic
energy
act
on
the
books
now
for
nearly
20
years
at
the
time
of
the
water
act
was
passed.
we
think
it
would
be
remarkable
indeed
if
congress
directed
the
epa
to
regulate
the
same
nuclear
materials
for
the
same
purposes
that
they
are
being
regulated
now
by
the
nrc
and
that
it
is
precisely
the
same
time.
the
house
committee
report
which
is
cited
on
page
38
of
our
brief,
we
think
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
no
such
thing.
report
says
that
the
term
pollutant
is
defined
in
this
bill
includes
radioactive
materials.
but
these
materials
are
not
those
encompassed
in
the
definition
of
source,
byproduct
or
special
nuclear
materials
as
defined
by
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
as
amended
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
the
material
or
the
congress
wanted
epa
to
regulate
was
the
material
that
was
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
what
was
then
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
this
was
not
a
statement
and
a
report
that
was
buried
away
and
forgotten,
written
but
not
read
by
the
people
that
were
most
concerned
with
this
legislation
because
this
statement
in
the
house
report
was
specifically
cited
and
relied
upon
and
later
floor
debates
and
specifically
in
order
to
defeat
an
amendment
submitted
by
congressman
wolfe
that
would
have
had
the
effect
submitted
on
the
house
floor
that
would
have
had
the
effect
of
allowing
the
states
to
be
able
to
regulate
radioactive
discharges
from
nuclear
power
plants.
mr.
randolph
they
are
not
absolutely
inconsistent
but
i
think
it
is
inconceivable
that
if
congress
on
the
one
hand
writes
a
statute
and
then
directs
and
the
report
that
they
are
only
doing
with
materials
that
are
not
regulated
aec
that
they
would
want
the
epa
to
regulate
that
material
too.
and
it
is
also
inconceivable
i
think
that
in
light
of
the
lack
of
any
consideration
of
what
a
regulatory
scheme
would
result
from
two
regulations
by
an
agency
that
on
the
one
hand
could
only
regulate
how
much
comes
out
and
an
agency
on
the
other
hand
that
regulates
not
only
that
but
the
design,
the
operation,
the
licensing
function
with
no
consideration
or
whatsoever.
i
think
that
the
potential
for
inconsistent
regulations
would
certainly
be
there.
and
it
is
a
potential
that
we
think
would
be
dangerous
for
the
reasons
we
stated
and
we
also
think
the
congress
gave
absolutely
no
consideration
to
whatsoever.
and
indeed
the
wolfe
amendment
that
i
was
about
to
discuss
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
one
of
the
basis
on
which
that
was
opposed
is
that
in
this
act,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
material
that
is
regulated
by
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
therefore
we
are
not
going
to
give
it
to
the
states.
a
number
of
congressmen
said
if
we
want
to
deal
with
that
question,
let
us
amend
the
atomic
energy
act
directly.
not
do
it
collaterally
in
which
case
the
legislation
should
go
through
the
relevant
committee,
the
joint
committee
on
atomic
energy
which
handles
these
particular
matters.
the
congressman
that
spoke
up
against
that
amendment
were
not
only
congressman
who
were
members
of
the
joint
committee
on
atomic
energy
but
also
members
of
the
public
works
committee
that
reported
out
this
bill.
and
the
amendment
that
i
was
speaking
of,
the
wolfe
amendment
that
was
defeated
by
a
three
to
one
margin.
on
the
senate
side,
senator
pastore
who
was
then
chairman
of
the
joint
committee
on
atomic
energy
sought
assurances
from
senator
muskie
who
sponsored
the
bill
on
the
senate
side,
that
this
legislation
that
they
were
then
considering
would
in
no
way
affect
the
regulatory
responsibility
and
control
under
the
atomic
energy
act.
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
that
if
the
environmental
protection
agency
is
given
regulatory
authority
over
the
same
materials
that
that
will
have
an
effect
on
the
responsibility
and
authority
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
on
hopes
it
would
not
be
inconsistent.
but
it
nevertheless
would
have
an
effect.
i
think
respondents
have
sought
to
and
the
states
also
have
sought
to
try
to
work
out
some
system
that
would
operate
when
you
have
this
redundant
regulatory
control
for
the
same
purposes
of
the
same
material.
someone
has
to
give
way
some
place
and
there
is
no
question
as
i
said
that
that
would
really
be
inconsistent
with
senator
muskie’s
assurances
to
senator
pastore
that
the
bill
that
had
in
front
of
them
would
not
have
any
effect.
when
the
conference
committee
reported
out
this
bill,
two
members
of
the
conference
committee
who
were
in
the
house
of
representatives
again
assured
that
the
radioactive
materials
did
not
include
the
atomic
energy
act
regulated
nuclear
materials,
confirming
the
understanding
of
the
representative
who
asked
the
question.
we
think
it
is
important
to
remember
here
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
statute
that
is
directed
not
regulating
the
activities
of
the
general
public.
what
we
are
dealing
herewith
is
the
statute
with
directions
to
one
person.
the
administrator
of
the
of
the
environmental
protection
agency,
telling
him
what
to
regulate
and
he
is
a
person
that
congress
i
think
can
in
fact
trust
to
know
precisely
what
congress
had
in
mind.
epa
administrator
was
testifying
at
the
hearings.
he
was
in
active
participation
with
this
legislation
as
it
was
going
through.
and
i
would
like
to
read
from
what
senator
muskie
said
on
the
senate
floor
and
this
is
not
quoted
in
any
of
the
brief
so
i
give
the
court
the
citation.
it
is
on
the
second
volume
of
the
compiled
legislative
history
on
pages
1347
to
1348.
i
am
taking
this
out
of
context.
it
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
radioactive
material.
but
what
he
is
talking
about
is
what
the
administrator’s
responsibility
is
in
defining
and
in
dealing
with
the
very
section
we
are
discussing
here,
the
section
defining
a
pollutant.
and
senator
muskie
says,
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
business
of
defining
or
applying
these
definitions
to
particular
kinds
of
pollutants.
that
is
an
administrative
decision
to
be
made
by
the
administrator,
sometimes
a
particular
kind
of
matter
is
a
pollutant
in
one
circumstance
and
not
in
another.
that
is
a
decision
to
be
made.
i
am
very
reluctant
to
try
to
make
it
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
he
goes
on.
this
bill
does
not
prohibit
discharges.
it
prohibits
the
discharge
of
pollutants.
so
we
get
back
to
what
a
pollutant
is
under
a
particular
set
of
circumstances.
i
cannot
interpret
all
the
circumstances.
the
administrator
can
do
so.
i
would
like
to
that
to
be
helpful
to
my
colleague
but
we
are
going
to
have
to
live
it
to
the
judgment
of
the
administrator.
and
that
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
it
was
left
to
the
judgment
of
the
administrator
and
he
interpreted
the
legislative
history
which
we
think
is
convincing.
before
i
leave
that,
i
would
like
to
mention
one
other
thing
which
we
think
is
relevant,
hardly
convincing
but
when
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
and
erda
were
formed
by
the
re-organization
act
of
1974,
an
amendment
was
proposed
in
the
house
that
would
have
had
the
effect
of
redefining
radioactive
materials
as
used
in
this
act
to
mean
materials
including
those
now
regulated
under
the
atomic
energy
act.
the
amendment
was
rejected
by
voice
vote.
the
citations
were
set
up
at
page
49
of
our
brief.
in
other
words,
in
the
house
at
least,
congress
voted
on
the
question
that
is
before
the
court
and
rejected
amendment
to
accomplish
the
result
of
the
court
of
appeals,
accomplished
here.
that
was
in
december
of
1973,
a
number
of
months
after
the
suit
had
been
instituted.
well,
before
the
court
of
appeals’
decision--
mr.
randolph
it
was
the
following
congress,
mr.
justice.
i
have
to
check
on
that.
i
am
not
sure.
the--
mr.
randolph
yes
mr.
justice
powell?
mr.
randolph
the
duties
of
administering
the
order
act
were
given
to
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency.
mr.
randolph
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
no.
mr.
randolph
there
may
be
separate
commissions
for
advice
on,
for
example,
sewer
problems
and
--
mr.
randolph
epa.
mr.
randolph
i
might
say
that
as
we
said
in
the
footnote
in
our
briefs
that
the
views
i
am
expressing
to
this
court,
are
the
views
that
are
expressed
in
our
brief
are
concurred
in
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
and
the
energy
and
research
development
administration.
they
did
not
file
a
separate
amicus
brief
because
i
think
that
as
far
as
this
issue
is
concerned;
all
three
agencies
are
for
square
set
that
this
material
that
is
sought
to
be
regulated
here
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
epa.
mr.
randolph
yes,
the
administrator
and
the
agency
itself
are
the
only
parties
--
mr.
randolph
oh!
that
is
right.
well,
they
have
no
choice.
regardless
of
which
way
this
case
--
mr.
randolph
they
have
i
think
in
section
209,
two
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
congress
said,
you
are
prohibited
from
giving
up
any
regulatory
authority
--
mr.
randolph
their
jurisdiction
had
been
considered
exclusive
until
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
below
and
in
fact,
as
the
court
has
probably
aware,
again
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
a
possibility
of
explaining
this
but
in
the
northern
states
power
case,
that
was
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
decided
in
discussed
in
the
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
there
held
that
the
federal
law,
the
atomic
energy
act
preempted
the
states
so
that
one
of
the
reasons
was
that
it
was
necessary
and
indeed
a
legislative
history
of
atomic
energy
act
indicated
clearly
that
it
was
important
for
one
agency
to
have
exclusive
control
over
this
dangerous
material.
the
supreme
court,
this
court
affirmed
that
decision
in
405
u.s.
mr.
randolph
i
do
not
know.
mr.
randolph
i
know
we
can
remove
the
epa
administrator.
mr.
randolph
i
suppose
it
is
right.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question
but
i
would
be
happy
to
send
a
letter
to
the
court.
the
role
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
of
course
was
the
same
role
that
the
epa
administrator
has
in
this
case
that
was
to
effectuate
congress’
intention
in
this
act.
i
have
a
note
that
says
they
are
appointed
to
a
five-year
term.
and
that
was
to
effectuate
congress’
will
here.
the
court
below
was
looking
at
the
same
material,
same
information,
the
same
statute
that
the
epa
administrator
was
interpreting.
there
is
an
argument
here
that
is
put
forth
that
we
think
it
is
not
really
a
very
proper
persuasive
argument.
that
is
that
well,
if
congress
really
meant
this,
they
could
have
said
it.
why
did
they
not
write
it
in?
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
argument
begs
the
question
because
congress
if
you
look
through
the
legislative
history
and
most
of
the
members
i
would
suppose
read
that
report,
at
least
a
great
many
of
them
did
because
they
relied
on
the
house
report
and
muskie's
exchange,
i
thought
there
was
no
necessity
to
write
it
in
because
they
knew
or
at
least
they
thought
what
they
were
dealing
with
here.
it
also
is
a
statement,
well,
congress
could
have
said
it
more
clearly
that
can
be
made
in
every
statutory
interpretation
case.
congress
can
always
speak
more
clearly
but
that
statement
really
imposes
upon
congress
some
sort
of
obligation
to
write
in
detail
every
problem
and
solve
every
problem
that
comes
up
by
writing
it
into
this
language
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
role
in
this
case
was
not
to
impose
that
kind
of
a
requirement
on
congress
but
to
effectuate
what
his
will
is.
mr.
randolph
absolutely.
absolutely,
it
is
not
clear
who
would
control
that
situation.
i
suppose
there
has
been
a
lot
of
thought
that
it
would
be
the
lesser
whoever
says
you
can
introduce
the
less.
the
least
is
the
one
that
controls
because
by
doing
that
you
always
satisfy
the,
one
agency
says
5
millirems
in
the
epa
says
four
and
then
you
do
four
because
that
satisfies
eps.
i
might
say
that
epa
as
a
result
of
this
decision,
if
it
is
reversed,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
environmental
protection
agency
has
no
role
to
play
in
regulating
radioactive
material.
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
footnote
26
on
page
37
of
our
brief,
some
of
the
areas
that
the
epa
still
has
to
regulate.
one
of
the
things
we
mentioned
was
that
epa
was
preparing
effluent
limitation
for
radium,
uranium,
and
thorium
released
in
ore
mining
operations
which
are
not
controlled
in
any
way
by
the
atomic
energy
act.
i
might
mention
to
the
court
that
these
regulations,
proposed
regulations
by
epa
have
now
been
published
on
november
6,
1975.
the
citation
is
40
federal
register
51722
and
of
course
the
epa
still
has
regulatory
authority
to
set
what
is
known
as
the
ambient
radiation
limits
and
they
have
done
that
as
we
mentioned
on
page
52
of
our
brief.
mr.
randolph
yes.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
randolph
it
is
sort
of
like
the
clear
air
act
system
where
the
epa
set
the
ambient
quality
and
then
air
quality
and
then
--
mr.
randolph
well,
the
states
do
regulate
the
discharge--
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
mr.
randolph
well,
no,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
epa
general
standards
apply
to
the
release
of
radioactive
material
from
the
sources
that
are
governed
by
the
nrc.
so,
when
they
say
--
what
they
set
is
a
25-millirem
standard.
mr.
randolph
no,
that
was
a
question
that
arose
in
the
administration
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
i
might
just
say
that
the
question
that
you
are
asking
arose
not
under
the
water
act,
before
the
water
act
was
even
passed,
that
question
arose
because
epa
was
given
authority
under
the
authority
under
the
federal
radiation
counsel
who
set
these
standards
and
there
were
some
question.
we
mentioned
the
ash
memorandum
that
arose
within
the
administration
about
what
that
did.
did
that
gave
epa
authority
to
set
points
--
mr.
randolph
total,
cumulative,
right?
mr.
randolph
radioactive
isotopes
which
is
used
mainly
in
hospitals
and
i
think--
mr.
randolph
the
epa
regulates
the
mining?
mr.
randolph
from
man
produced
radioactive
materials
other
than
radioactive
isotopes
produced
by
accelerators.
i
mean
there
is
radioactivity
everywhere,
granite
buildings
have
a
great
deal
of
radioactivity.
if
you
sit
in
the
senate
office
building
you
get
445
millirems
a
year.
but
as
far
as
man
produce
radioactivity,
that
is
right.
mr.
randolph
no,
that
is
right.
mr.
randolph
who
controls
the
specific
discharge
limits
from
an
individual
plant?
that
is
what
the
question
in
this
case
is.
right.
thank
you.
