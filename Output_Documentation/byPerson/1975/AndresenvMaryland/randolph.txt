mr.
randolph
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
here
to
argue
the
question
arising
under
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
it
is
our
position
that
a
defendant
has
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
bar
the
admission
into
evidence
of
items
seized,
in
this
case
business
records
from
him,
so
long
as
the
items
were
seized
in
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment.
the
purpose
of
my
argument,
i
will
assume
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
not
been
violated
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
suggested
in
his
oral
argument
that
documents,
papers,
books,
ledgers
are
accorded
and
should
be
accorded
special
treatment.
that
is
that
when
such
items
are
seized,
apparently
the
trial
courts
review
them
to
see
if
they
contain
ideas
and
petitioner
contends
that
if
they
do
contain
ideas,
then
he
can
properly
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
bar
their
introduction.
presumably,
petitioner
is
referring
to
only
his
ideas
it
seems,
would
seem
incredible
that
a
book
found
on
a
--
in
a
bomber’s
apartment
that
said,
how
to
make
bombs
which
contains
ideas
would
fall
under
his
rule.
but
in
any
event,
what
petitioner
is
contending
now
really
sounds
more
like
a
first
amendment
claim
and
the
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment.
why
the
fact
that
a
document
contains
ideas,
implicates
the
fifth
amendment
is
hardly
clear
and
is
hardly
clear
where
the
court
would
go,
what
the
--
where
the
path
would
lead
if
the
court
adopted
such
a
doctrine.
would
it
mean
for
example,
that
it
would,
you
could
seize
a
robber’s
mask,
but
not
the
note
that
he
showed
to
the
teller
or
the
schematic
drawing
that
he
made
of
the
bank
prior
to
the
robbery
or
that
you
could
take
the
typewriter
from
the
kidnapper’s
apartment,
but
not
the
half
completed
ransom
note
that
is
contained
in
it
or
indeed
even
closer
to
a
case
decided
by
this
court
that
you
could
not
seize
a
coded
message
on
a
piece
of
graph
paper
which
was
what
was
seized
in
the
abel
case
and
introduced
into
evidence
and
upheld
by
this
court.
presumably,
most
telephone
calls,
one
likes
to
think
contain
ideas
and
yet
this
court
has
upheld
under
proper
circumstances
in
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment,
the
seizure
is
such
cause.
as
far
as
petitioner’s
case
is
concerned,
it
is
doubly
difficult
to
see
why
the
fifth
amendment
is
involved.
certainly,
petitioner
was
not
compelled
to
take
the
stand
in
this
case
and
in
fact
he
did
not.
he
was
not
compelled
the
right.
he
was
not
required
to
speak.
he
was
not
forced
to
admit
anything
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
documents
that
are
contained
in
our
appendix
in
the
bright
yellow
volume
were
all
documents
that
petitioner
created
himself
or
that
someone
in
his
employment
created
presumably
for
him.
petitioner
seems
to
contend
that
because
he
was
the
source
of
evidence,
and
so
do
incriminate
him,
he
was
compelled
to
be
the
source
because
he
had
to
subject
himself
to
a
search,
that
therefore,
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
bars
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
obtained.
the
court
has
rejected
just
such
an
argument
in
the
schmerber
case
and
it
rejected
it
again,
i
think
in
dionisio
and
in
the
mara
case
only
a
few
terms
ago.
the
test
in
every
case
must
be
testimonial
--
mr.
randolph
in
mara,
there
were
doc
--
they
were
handwriting
exemplars
and
the
--
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
ever
directly
faced
the
doctrines
question.
that
is
(voice
overlap)
mr.
randolph
well,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
accurate
to
say
the
question
was
left
open.
what
schmerber
--
warden
and
hayden
--
what
warden
and
hayden
said
is
we
do
not
have
to
decide
that
issue
here.
i
do
not
think
that
implies
--
mr.
randolph
well,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
compulsion
on
the
one
hand
and
the
question
on
whether
the
document
seized
is
testimonial
on
the
other
seemed
to
me
not
to
relate
to
one
another.
it
is
not
very
much
different
in
saying
in
the
month
of
may
more
babies
are
born
in
denmark
and
also
in
the
month
of
may
more
storks
fly
over
denmark.
therefore,
the
conclusion
is
obvious
is
it
not?
storks
bring
babies.
no,
it
is
not
obvious.
just
because
there
is
compulsion,
if
you
define
it
as
having
to
stand
aside
while
the
police
search
and
just
because
the
document
is
testimonial,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
in
anyway
implicate
because
--
mr.
randolph
yes,
boyd
said
that
and
i
think
--
mr.
randolph
i
think
the
court
is
moved
away
from
--
mr.
randolph
i
think
that
is
true,
yes,
but
i
think
the
court
has
moved
away
from
that.
in
mapp
versus
ohio,
i
agree
it
was
only
four
justices
and
justice
black
expressed
that
view
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
mapp,
but
in
mapp
v.
ohio
the
court
arrested
the
exclusionary
rule
it
seems
on
the
fourth
amendment
i
think
calandra
makes
it
even
clear
that
it
rests
on
the
fourth
amendment
not
the
fifth.
when
mapp
was
decided,
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
made
applicable
to
the
states.
it
was
not
done
so
until
malloy
v.
hogan
i
think
two
years
later.
mr.
randolph
it
was
warden
and
hayden.
mr.
randolph
now,
there
has
been
some
talk
about
the
analogy
here
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
in
the
cases
that
court
has
decided
under
that.
petitioner
seems
to
argue
that
simply
because
a
document
maybe,
that
he
may
invoke
his
privilege
to
bar
production
of
a
document
pursuant
to
a
subpoena,
therefore,
it
follows
that
the
document
cannot
be
had
pursuant
to
a
search.
and
he
assumes
that
he
could
have
barred
the
production
of
these
documents
in
this
case
by,
if
they
have
been
sought
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
i
will
assume
the
premise,
but
the
conclusion
that
he
reaches
from
that
does
not
follow
because
he
has
failed
to
take
into
account
the
reason
why
the
fifth
amendment
is
implicated
when
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
is
issued
to
an
accused
or
to
a
suspect
in
a
case.
the
court
said
in
united
states
v.
white,
it
repeated
again
in
couch,
said
it
again
in
bellis
recently
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
designed
to
prevent
the
use
of
or
to
prevent
the
use
of
legal
process
“to
force
an
accused
to
produce
and
authenticate
any
personal
documents
or
effects
that
might
incriminate
him.”
as
far
as
the
subpoena
is
concerned,
the
court
has
not
drawn
a
distinction
between
documents
on
the
one
hand
or
effects
on
the
other.
the
fourth
amendment
certainly
does
not
draw
such
a
distinction.
it
talks
of
persons,
homes,
of
papers
and
effects.
all
the
items
are
on
an
equal
plane.
so
if
petitioner’s
argument
were
accepted,
arguably
it
may
mean
and
since
the
government
may
not
be
able
to
subpoena
even
tangible
items
like
a
gun
or
the
bag
in
which
weapons
were
carried,
therefore,
it
could
not
validly
search
for
such
items.
and
i
think
the
history
of
this
court’s
decisions
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
enough
to
refute
that
contention,
but
that
brings
me
to
what
i
think
is
the
critical
point,
what
the
government
thinks
is
the
critical
point
in
this
case,
that
is
when
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
is
issued
to
an
accused,
it
forces
him
to
respond.
when
a
search
warrant
is
issued,
there
is
no
such
compulsion
to
respond.
in
the
forced
response
from
the
subpoena
duces
tecum,
the
court
has
found
implicit
testimony
that
is
that
the
item
demanded
is
the
item
produced.
if
you
look
at
a
subpoena
and
the
federal
rules
are
set
out,
the
subpoena
says,
you
are
hereby
commanded,
that
sounds
very
much
like
compulsion
and
the
command
is
directed
to
the
person
that
receives
the
subpoena.
a
similar
language
in
the
search
warrant,
you
are
hereby
commanded,
but
the
command
goes
not
to
the
person
who
is
subject
to
the
search,
it
goes
to
the
person,
the
officer
of
the
law
who
executes
it.
as
far
as
the
person
subject
to
the
search
is
concerned,
his
only
--
the
only
restrain
on
him
is
to
stand
aside
to
let
the
search
proceed.
he
is
compelled
to
do
nothing.
although,
that
is
rather
ambiguous
phrase,
but
in
those
circumstances
it
seems
odd
as
an
initial
matter
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
violated
by
telling
someone
to
stand
aside.
you
are
thereby
compelling
him
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
now,
petitioner’s
argued
and
boyd
itself
seems
to
say
throughout,
and
i
think
what
is
left
after
this
and
i
will
address
boyd
in
a
moment,
the
dictum
in
boyd,
is
really
a
generalized
claim
of
privacy
that,
well,
petitioner
ought
to
be
allowed
to
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
because
after
all,
his
privacy
would
be
invaded.
we
think,
properly
understood,
privacy
is
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
at
least
as
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned.
the
rule,
the
general
rule,
i
think
the
court
has
referred
to
it
as
the
ancient
rule,
is
just
the
opposite.
in
a
criminal
case,
the
public
has
the
right
to
every
man’s
evidence,
whether
that
evidence
is
private
so
long
as
it
is
related
to
the
question
before
the
court
or
before
the
jury.
the
rule
applies
to
newsman,
the
court
so
held
in
branzburg
v.
hayes,
it
even
applies
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
if
they
designed
the
fifth
amendment
to
protect
privacy
committed
an
incredible
blunder
because
if
they
designed
it
to
protect
the
privacy
of
the
citizens
of
this
country,
they
left
out
all
the
innocent
people
here
who
could
never
claim
the
fifth
amendment
or
that
they
would
be
incriminated
by
producing
a
document.
i
think
what
i
have
just
said
has
been
repeated
by
the
court
recently
in
a
footnote,
in
nobles,
in
the
nobles
case,
footnote
7
specifically,
where
the
court
quotes
mr.
justice
white
concurring
in
united
states
v.
mara,
i
think
it
was
where
mr.
justice
white
said
the
purpose
of
the
relevant
part
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
to
prevent
self-incrimination
not
to
protect
private
information.
now,
as
far
as
boyd
is
concerned,
there
is
dictum
to
be
sure
that
seems
to
point
in
the
other
way.
the
court
could
find
no
difference
between
on
the
one
hand
a
search
for
evidence
and
compelling
a
man
to
incriminate
himself.
but
the
premises
on
which
boyd
rested
we
think
are
undercut
and
have
been
undercut
for
quite
sometime
in
this
court.
first
of
all,
one
premise,
there
are
four
basic
premises
for
that
statement
in
boyd,
the
first
is
that
a
search
and
seizure
of
mere
evidence
is
not
permitted,
warden
v.
hayden
overruled
that
doctrine.
the
second
is
that
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
which
was
the
fact
situation
of
boyd
is
the
equivalent
of
search
and
seizure.
since
oklahoma
publishing
company
v.
walling,
the
court
has
not
followed
that
doctrine,
they
are
not
equated.
the
third
resting
point
of
boyd
is
the
one
i
have
already
mentioned.
that
evidence
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
violates
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
if
introduced,
an
exclusionary
rule.
i
think
that
decisions
of
this
court
for
mapp
versus
ohio
on
recognized
the
exclusionary
rule
rests
on
the
constitutional
basis
on
the
fourth
amendment
only.
and
finally,
the
final
point
of
boyd
is
that
compelling
a
person
to
final
premise
of
boyd
is
that
compelling
a
person
to
be
the
source
of
incriminating
evidence
violates
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
that
was
rejected
in
schmerber
which
involved
the
taking
of
a
blood
sample
from
an
individual
under
compulsion.
that
was
rejected
in
wade,
which
involved
the
lineup.
it
was
rejected
i
think
in
dionisio
which
involved
the
voice
exemplar,
and
it
was
rejected
in
mara.
so,
they
are
four
basic
pillars
to
the
foundation
of
boyd.
one,
the
search
and
seizure
of
mere
evidence;
two,
the
subpoena
is
equal
to
a
search;
three,
evidence
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
violates
the
fifth
exclusionary
rule,
and
four,
compelling
a
person
to
be
the
source
of
incriminating
evidence
violates
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
not
a
single
one
of
those
doctrines
stands
anymore.
we
think,
therefore
that
what
was
only
dictum
in
just
a
few
lines
in
the
boyd
opinion
is
no
longer
a
good
law
and
should
not
be
followed.
thank
you.
mr.
randolph
well,
his
concurring
opinion
in
mapp
versus
ohio
is
--
would
not
--
if
it
were
accepted
would
not
affect
my
argument
because
his
concurring
opinion
was
that
if
evidence
taken
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
introduced,
it
violates
the
fifth.
the
premise
of
his
argument
is
that
it
violates
--
that
the
evidence
has
been
taken
in
violation
of
the
fourth,
and
of
course,
i
am
assuming
that
it
has
not
--
mr.
randolph
well,
of
course.
the
fifth
amendment
says
that
it
is
compelled
a
witness
against
himself,
but
as
i
said
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
accepted
that
doctrine.
mr.
randolph
and
your
dissenting
opinion
in
the
bivens'
case
i
think
details
this
development.
thank
you.
oh!
i
am
sorry
i

been
asked
