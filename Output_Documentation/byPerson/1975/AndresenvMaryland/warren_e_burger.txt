chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1646,
andresen
against
maryland.
mr.
andresen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
referring
page
36
of
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
an
application
for
a
warrant
must
contain
a
balanced
presentation
of
the
facts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
not
directing
it
to
withholding
facts,
but
it
is
your
view
that
it
must
present
both
sides
of
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
instead
of
a
gun,
mr.
andresen,
the
things
taken
were
papers,
namely,
obviously
and
admittedly
forged
promissory
notes
and
mortgage
papers.
let
us
assume
that
they
were
later
established
to
be
forged
papers,
forged
by
the
person
from
whom
they
were
seized.
now,
they
are
papers
as
distinguished
from
guns,
would
you
say
that
there
is
a
compulsion
that
that
is
compelled
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
change
(voice
overlap),
he
forged
promissory
notes
or
mortgages,
counterfeit
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
promissory
note
an
object?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
written
in
the
hand,
forged
by
the
hand
of
the
person
from
whom
it
was
seized?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
concerned
about
what
it
is
until
it
is
offered
and
received
in
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
reserve
any
time
for
rebuttal,
you
are
now
into
your
last
five
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
oster.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
these
are
traditional
business
records?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
in
the
regular
course
of
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
oâ€™clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
oster
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
you
are
giving
us
now
go
to
the
question
whether
this
is
a
business
record
originally
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
with
the
limited
time
you
have,
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
none
of
this
fell
under
catch
all
clause
at
the
end
of
the
warrant,
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
they
are
all
specifically
identified
in
the
warrant,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
an
application?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
identified
specifically?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
be
sure.
you
have
said
to
us
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
that
all
of
the
five
exhibits
submitted
were
identified
in
the
warrant
and
were
not
taken
pursuant
to
the
catch-all
clause
at
the
end?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
position
would
be,
even
if
you
took
500
documents
erroneously,
but
did
not
have
them
go
into
evidence,
it
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
we
do
not
care
about
the
things
that
were
not
admitted
at
least
i,
speaking
for
myself
that
is
not
in
the
case.
it
is
what
was
admitted
that
we
are
concerned
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
oster.
mr.
randolph.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
pointed
out
a
number
of
expressions
since
then
and
within
the
courts
have
gone
the
other
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
transcript
or
the
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
andresen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
search
warrant
in
the
boyd
case?
chief

e.
burger

you.

case
is
submitted.
