justice

the
word
time
is
supposed
to
be
in
there.
it

not
in
my

on

mine
just
says,
that
this
unknown.
justice
potter
stewart
who
two
--
different
lawyers
offices
or
two
offices
in
this
suite
of
offices?

justice

blocks
away,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
is
the
rule
of
maryland
law
is
it
that
whenever
anything
that
has
been
seized
under
a
warrant
is
introduced
in
evidence,
the
warrant
itself
also
has
to
be
introduced
with
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
true
even
if
there
is
no
objection
to
the
introduction
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
compulsion
involved
in
this
evidence
with
respect
to
your
argument
about
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
you
concede
of
course
that
there
must
be
some
--
that
the
defendant
must
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
we
want
was
--
what
was
the
compulsion
exerted
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
somebody
else
did
that.
the
defendant
was
not
compelled
to
do
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
cases
have
you
got
for
that,
that
indicates
it
is
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
that
of
course
of
the
hills
case.
justice
potter
stewart
what
else?
do
you
have
any
cases
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
tell
me
what
compulsion
there
is
then?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
tell
me
what
compulsion
was
the
--
what
was
the
defendant
compelled
to
do
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
kind
of
an
argument
with
me
would
go
for
any
kind
of
evidence,
would
it
not?
you
could
never
--
justice
potter
stewart
let
us
assume
--
let
us
assume
the
searches
in
this
case
had
not
only
seized
papers,
but
it
seized,
let
us
just
assume
that
a
gun
was
relevant
to
the
case,
just
assume
that,
they
seized
papers
and
a
gun.
now,
would
you
say
that
the
defendant
was
compelled
to
--
in
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment
to
incriminate
himself
by
not
only
the
papers,
but
by
the
gun?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
be
compelled
to
furnish
it,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
he
testifying
with
the
papers?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
suggesting,
i
suppose,
that
if
what
was
seized
was
a
diary
written
in
the
handwriting
of
the
petitioner
which
was
self
incriminating
that
that
would
constitute
--
the
introduction
of
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
at
least
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
trial
judge
to
look
and
see
if
these
material
was

difference
of
about
three,
less
than
$300.00?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
there
was
a
--
at
least
one
case
here
where
the
question
was
explicitly
left
open.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
just
read
warden
and
hayden,
i
was
settling
now
for
gilbert.
i
thought
that
is
what
i
had
in
mind
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
that
means
that
or
perhaps
i
just
sing
out
loud,
as
i
recollect
mr.
justice
blackâ€™s
concurring
in
the
opinion
in
mapp
against
ohio
was
based
upon
those
doctrines
of
the
boyd
case?
justice
potter
stewart
there
had
to
be?
