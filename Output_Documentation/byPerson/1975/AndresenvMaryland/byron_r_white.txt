justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
basic
defect
that
you
claimed
was
not
cured
by
the
extent
to
which
the
trial
court
suppressed
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
handful
of
papers
that
were
left
over
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
was
left
over
that
you
talked
about,
you
say
was
tainted
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
should
have
been
obtained
by
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
--
under
a
general
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
trial
was
on
the
original
counts,
was
not
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
that
indictment
can
--
that
was
consolidated
with,
contained
17
counts?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
--
were
any
of
those
counts
obtained,
do
you
claim
based
on
the
evidence
that
was
seized?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
a
--
how
about
the
evidence,
that
handful
of
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
healthy
handful
of
papers,
but
to
which
counts
did
the
trial
court
say
they
were
relevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would
have
been
true
whether
the
case
was,
whether
there
had
been
a
consolidation
with
another
indictment
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
just
tried
on
the
original
four?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
--
this
warrant,
this
seizure
did
no
make
you
--
make
the
defendant
do
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
have
been
there,
would
there
have
been
compulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
say
that
the
--
that
any
--
any
of
the
arguments
that
are
presented
relate
only
to
certain
counts?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
counts
on
which
they
were
given
concurrent
sentences
had
--
do
not
have
the
--
this
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
are
those
counts
independently
affirmed
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
how
about
the
separate
forms
--
i
take
it
you
say
that
there
were
--
that
the
evidence
on
certain
counts
did
not
include
any
of
this
material
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
was
seized
from
the
office?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
principally,
let
us
--
let
us
get
it
--
give
me
a
count
that
the
evidence
on
which
it
did
not
rest
at
all
or
completely
unrelated
to
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
evidence
did
not
include
any
of
the
evidence
received
from
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
it
does
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
point
this
out
--
on
your
--
to
response
to
the
petitioner?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
not
(inaudible)
the
remaining
fourth
amendment
argument
though
was
it
--
it
was
just
a
shotgun
warning?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
probable
cause
are
not,
just
warrant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
any
of
the
evidence
that
was
not
suppressed
was
specifically
listed?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
we
are
asking
is
that
perhaps
all
of
the
evidence
or
at
least
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
at
trial,
all
of
that
was
specifically
listed
on
the
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
it
was
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
general
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
were
any
of
the
documents
suppressed,
suppressed
for
the
reason
that
they
were
not
specified
on
the
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is,
my
question
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
them
was
suppressed
because
they
were
not
listed
with
specificity
on
the
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
did
the
warrant
list
any
of
the
documents
that
were
suppressed?
i
thought
you
indicated
to
me
that
the
warrant
listed
all
of
that
was
suppressed.
if
there
was
no
nexus
between
them
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
yes,
that
is
just
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
they
were,
are
you
as
a
state
in
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
compulsion?
(voice
overlap)
where
is
the
compulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
whichever
came
last,
cited
the
former
and
at
least
they
were
tied
together
so
the
reservation
is
there
on
documents.
i
do
not
know
that
the
reservation
relates
to
whether
there
is
a
compulsion
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
cases,
there
are
several
cases
in
the
court
that
say
that
if
the
fourth
amendment
is
violated,
so
as
the
fifth?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
a
whole
line
of
cases
said
that,
and
the
only
way
that
fifth
could
have
been
violated
is
if
there
are
some
element
of
compulsion
in
a
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
not
so,
is
it
not
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
also
have
to
be
that
there
was
compulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
fundamentally
is
that
even
if
you
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment,
you
have
a
perfect
search
warrant
and
even
though
the
search
is
a
reasonable
one,
it
nevertheless
violates
the
fifth
amendment
if
the
search
warrant
has
named
the
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
andresen,
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
saying
that
the
conviction
on
some
of
these
counts
did
not
rest
at
all
on
any
of
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
and
which
you
challenge?
