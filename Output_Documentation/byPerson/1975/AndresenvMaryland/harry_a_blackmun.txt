justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
to
what
issue
in
the
case
is
this
all
relevant?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
first
one
is
74-1646
andresen
versus
maryland,
this
case
comes
to
us
by
certiorari
to
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland.
after
investigation
by
state
attorney's
fraud
unit
of
real
estate
settlement
activities
in
montgomery
and
prince
george's
counties,
indicated
that
the
petitioner
while
acting
as
a
settlement
attorney
had
defrauded
the
purchaser
of
certain
real
estate
known
as
lot
13t
in
potomac
woods.
the
search
warrants
were
issued
and
these
listed
specified
items
pertaining
to
lot
13t
to
be
seized
together
with
other
fruits
and
instrumentalities
and
evidence
of
crime.
in
the
ensuing
research
of
the
petitioner's
law
office
at
the
office
of
the
corporation
he
owned
and
controlled
solely
a
number
of
incriminating
documents
including
some
containing
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
were
seized,
and
he
was
then
charged
with
the
crime
of
false
pretenses
based
on
a
misrepresentation
to
the
purchaser
of
lot
13t.
the
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
the
seized
documents
and
this
motion
was
granted
as
to
some
but
the
court
ruled
with
respect
to
other
documents
that
their
admission
into
evidence
would
not
violate
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendments.
at
the
trial
which
resulted
in
a
conviction,
a
number
of
the
seized
items
were
admitted
in
evidence,
after
having
then
authenticated
by
prosecution
witnesses.
the
maryland
court
of
special
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
and
rejected
petitioner's
constitutional
claims.
we
hold
that
the
search
of
offices
for
business
records,
their
seizure,
and
their
subsequent
introduction
into
evidence
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case,
did
not
offend
the
fifth
amendment's
proscription
against
compulsory
self-incrimination.
although
the
records
seized
contained
statements
that
petitioner
had
committed
to
writing,
he
himself
was
never
required
to
say
anything
and
their
was
no
compulsion
to
speak
other
than
the
inherent
psychological
pressure
to
respond
at
trial
to
unfavorable
evidence.
we
further
hold
that
the
searches
and
seizures
were
not
unreasonable
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
warrants
in
our
view
were
not
general
warrants
we
also
hold
that
the
seizure
of
documents
pertaining
to
lot
other
than
13g
but
in
the
same
subdivision
and
the
subjected
to
the
same
liens,
did
not
violate
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
both
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
filed
separate
dissenting
opinions.
