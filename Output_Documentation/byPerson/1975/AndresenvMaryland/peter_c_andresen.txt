mr.
peter
c.
andresen
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
set
the
scene,
involved
in
the
search
and
its
fruits
which
are
complained
of
in
this
petition.
there
existed
between
petitioner
and
a
local
bank,
a
dispute
as
to
application
of
payments,
which
were
forwarded,
to
the
bank
to
extinguish
a
particular
lien,
which
encompass
several
properties
in
a
subdivision
in
montgomery
county.
it
was
the
basis
of
this
dispute
that
provided
the
hearsay
evidence
and
information
upon
which
the
affidavits
of
the
police
officers
were
based
which
was
used
to
obtain
the
search
warrant
to
search
the
petitioner’s
offices.
the
dispute
arose
because
the
indebted
party
for
whose
benefit
the
payments
were
being
forwarded
to
the
bank
was
the
credit
--
was
the
debtor
on
two
separate
debts,
one
of
which
was
a
lien
debt,
the
other
which
was
a
personal
debt.
and
although
the
checks
in
their
accompanying
letters
and
releases
which
were
mailed
to
the
bank
in
each
instance
were
forwarded
by
messenger,
stipulated
that
the
money
was
to
be
applied
to
a
particular
debt.
the
bank
instead
was
applying
the
money
to
the
personal
rather
than
the
secured
debt
and
this
came
to
light
later
in
a
civil
case
involving
the
same
subject
matter,
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
bank
was
erroneously
doing
so
and
in
fact
the
lien
complained
of
had
been
extinguished
some
months
prior
to
the
acts
complained
of
which
lead
to
the
search.
however,
this
was
a
scene
upon
which
the
information
was
related
to
the
investigators
who
swore
to
the
affidavit
contained
in
the
warrant
upon
which
the
circuit
court
judge
issued
and
found
probable
cause
and
issued
the
search
warrant.
now
the
warrants,
there
were
two
in
number,
called
for
the
search
of
petitioner’s
law
offices
and
also
another
office
which
was
occupied
jointly
by
petitioner
for
storage
of
his
files
and
with
some
corporate
offices
of
which
the
involvement
is
not
completely
clear,
but
the
petitioner
did
have
some
involvement.
there
were
two
separate
warrants
based
upon
the
same
affidavits.
the
majority
of
the
affidavits
were
the
same.
i
think
one
of
the
affidavits
had
some
additional
information
and
that
was
the
search
of
the
corporate
offices,
it
had
some
additional
information
to
establish
that
petitioner’s
legal
files
were
maintained
in
storage
and
that
some
of
his
employees
did
work
in
part
of
that
office.
now,
the
law
office
itself,
picture
if
you
will,
a
reception
room
with
a
secretary
and
other
chairs
and
one
desk,
a
large
office
type
room
which
was
entered
into,
through
the
reception
room,
contained
several
file
cabinets
along
one
wall,
completely
in
line
with
one
wall,
other
file
cabinets,
approximately
five
to
seven
desks
with
their
contents.
piles
of
papers
on
each
of
this
desk,
a
conference
room
and
two
lawyer’s
offices
of
which
there
were
book
cases
containing
papers,
credenzas
with
papers,
a
desk,
completely
average
legal
office.
papers
from
everywhere
and
contained
in
every
desk
drawer.
the
auxiliary
office
was
containing
even
more
files
and
title
files,
was
occupied
in
part
by
petitioner
and
his
law
clerk
and
used
for
reference
to
these
files
when
preparing
title
abstracts
information
because
petitioner
was
a
title
attorney
and
heavily
engaged
in
not
only
real
property
practice,
but
handling
transfers
of
real
estate
in
montgomery
county.
petitioner
had
handled
at
the
time
of
the
search,
according
to
his
files,
over
5,000
property
cases
since
he
conceived
this
practice,
all
of
which
files
are
maintained
in
these
two
locations.
now,
some
of
the
files
are
very
voluminous,
some
of
the
transfers
were
dependent
on
prior
transfers,
and
therefore,
the
files
were
not
so
voluminous.
but
the
files
comprised
so
much
space
that
even
though
petitioner's
office
was
a
1,200
to
1,400
foot
category
and
in
a
neighborhood
of
five
to
seven
employees
beside
himself
in
it,
that
he
had
to
have
additional
space
in
order
to
store
the
balance
of
the
records.
that
is
the
scene
upon
which
the
officers
entered
with
the
warrant.
the
affidavit
contained
in
the
warrants,
contains
mostly
interviews
with
individuals
and
the
results
of
these
interviews.
and
in
part
two
of
the
petition,
petitioner
complains
that
because
there
were
no
direct
observation
or
personal
knowledge
as
to
the
things
sought
in
the
affidavits
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
affidavits
to
spell
out
reasons
why
the
hearsay
evidence
was
reliable.
we
maintain
that
there
was
no
such
information
contained
in
the
affidavit.
that
the
information
was
sought
and
obtained
from
individuals
who
were
involved
with
the
petitioner
in
the
dispute
which
i
earlier
recited
to
the
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
investigators
at
page
36
of
the
brief
says
that
he
knew
at
the
time
of
the
affidavit
that
the
bank
officer
had
told
him
that
he
had
received
the
payments
complained
of,
but
in
fact
applied
them
to
another
debt.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
that
would
be
in
the
appendix,
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
the
second,
right,
the
second
appendix
which
should
be
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir.
no,
to
the
brief
on
the
merits.
the
beginning
of
the
--
the
application
in
affidavit
begins
at
page
897
which
is
the
--
on
the
first
pages
of
a
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
alright
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
a
very
lengthy
application
going
on
for
several
pages,
but
the
important
thing
that
i
intend
to
point
out
at
this
part
of
the
argument
is
that
the
information
was
not
fully
set
out
to
the
issuing
judge
as
he
was
only
presented
with
the
disputed
information
on
the
side
of
the
dispute
that
the
officers
choice
to
side
and
that
this
information
was
unreliable.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
i
think
you
must
present
all
the
facts
your
honor,
instead
of
withholding
facts
which
are
pertinent
to
the
issues
such
as
these
officers
did
as
they
admitted
under
cross
examination.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
if
it
is
important
to
the
issue,
yes
sir.
again,
the
court
of
special
appeals
felt
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
provide
information
as
to
why
the
sources
were
reliable
because
they
were
thought
to
be
dissenters
to
the
citizens.
however,
as
i
stated
it
could
hardly
be
considered
dissenters
to
the
citizens
when
they
were
deeply
involved
in
the
complained
off
problem
and
that
the
ops
--
that
the
allegations
were
later
proven
to
be
false
or
erroneous.
next,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
warrant
itself,
which
appears
at
page,
beginning
at
page
894.
on
page
895,
it
is
set
forth,
the
descriptive
phrase
of
the
things
sought
to
be
seized.
and
if
i
may,
it
begins
towards
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph,
saying
the
following
items
pertaining
to
a
particular
piece
of
property
and
then
the
warrant
sets
forth
virtually
every
type,
that
is
general
category
of
paper
or
document
in
existence
in
anyone’s
files
or
papers
that
could
possibly
relate
to
any
particular
source.
memoranda,
settlement
statements
memoranda,
correspondence,
disbursement
memoranda,
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera,
and
all
books,
records,
documents,
paper
memoranda,
and
correspondence
showing
or
tending
to
show
a
fraudulent
intent
and/or
knowledge
as
to
elements
of
a
certain
crime
or
false
pretenses
and
then
the
final
sentence
is
together
with
other
fruits,
instrumentalities
and
evidence
of
a
crime
at
this
time
unknown.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir,
the
word
time
should
appear,
that
is
a
typographical
error.
as
maintained
by
petitioner
that
the
general
language
as
to
the
types
of
papers
sought
was
as
general
as
the
one
struck
down
by
this
court
in
stanford
versus
texas.
in
stanford,
mr.
justice
stewart
speaking
for
the
court
used
the
terms
when
referring
to
books
and
papers
were
that
contained
ideas
or
thoughts
expressed
that
they
must
be
described
with,
“the
most
scrupulous
exactitude”
and
we
maintain
that
the
description
as
set
out
was
very
similar
to
that
used
in
stanford.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir,
your
honor.
there
were
several
books
seized
in
that
particular
search.
in
the
language
and
also
the
language
used
in
the
warrant
set
out
in
the
vonderahe
versus
howland
case
which
is
set
out
in
the
brief
by
a
warrant
struck
down
as
being
general.
when
referring
to
papers,
it
is
not
sufficient
to
just
describe
every
kind
of
paper.
let
us
say
letters,
books,
memoranda,
it
is
not
particular
nature
to
the
items
sought
to
be
seized
and
then
especially
when
you
add
the
language
of
other
evidence
of
crime
at
this
time
unknown,
which
means
that
the
officers
were
empowered
by
this
warrant
to
use
their
judgment,
make
legal
conclusions,
arrive
at
decisions
as
to
what
should
be
seized
and
what
should
not
be
seized.
now,
especially
when
they
even
had
the
authority
to
seize
evidence
of
crimes
that
they
did
not
even
know
about
at
the
time
that
they
entered
the
premises
and
one
must
also
look
at
the
extent
of
the
search.
in
stanford,
the
search
comprised
approximately
five
hours.
in
the
instant
case,
there
were
two
offices
being
searched
simultaneously
and
comprised
approximately
five
to
six
hours.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
no
sir.
one
whole
suite
of
offices
plus
at
another
location,
there
was
a
small
office
that
was
contained
in
overflow
of
files
were
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
right
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
just
a
couple
of
blocks
away.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
in
stanford,
the
officers
carried
away
approximately
2,000
books
and
pamphlets.
in
petitioner’s
case,
the
papers
were
never
counted.
nobody
ever
in
the
record
expressed,
how
many
papers
were
seized.
we
come
upon
a
lot
of
different
expressions
as
to
description
of
the
amount
of
paper
seized.
that
is
because
petitioner
feels
there
were
many
more
than
could
be
readily
counted.
at
one
point,
the
prosecuting
attorney
stated
at
page
372
of
the
transcript
of
motions
that
the
papers
comprised
three
file
cabinet
drawers
full
that
were
seized.
in
other
words,
the
officers
did
not
carry
away
boxes,
the
type
of
cartons
you
get
in
a
grocery
market,
with
them
carried
away
papers
and
when
they
got
back
to
the
office
with
them,
they
filled
up
three
file
cabinet
drawers.
i
measured
one
of
the
file
cabinet
drawers,
it
is
28
inches
deep,
and
i
also
measured
the
stack
of
papers
and
i
found
240
pages
in
each
inch
of
paper.
so
the
28
inches
of
file
cabinet
drawer
would
handle
between
six
and
seven
thousand
papers.
in
three
drawers
then
it
would
be
an
excess
of
20,000
papers
which
were
carried
away
and
most
of
these
papers
were
enclosed
in
large
files
which
were
enumerated
as
to
what
the
file
contained.
therefore,
we
contend
under
that
part
of
our
argument,
the
warrant
for
general
allowed
the
searchers
to
do
too
much,
and
therefore,
should
have
been
struck
down.
that
is
under
our
part
2b
of
the
argument.
i
am
quoting
from
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire
in
the
brief,
stated
by
this
court
that
distinct
objective
is
that
the
search
is
deemed
necessary,
it
should
be
as
limited
as
possible.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
particularity
of
description
which
is
required.
and
the
day
following
the
search
of
the
premises,
petitioner
was
arrested
in
front
of
his
office
and
charged
with
four
counts
of
false
pretenses
which
were
basically
as
to
subject
matter
contained
in
the
affidavit
for
the
warrant.
he
was
incarcerated,
then
released
on
bond
approximately
two
weeks
later.
after
a
thorough
study
of
all
the
papers
seized,
he
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
in
montgomery
county
on
approximately
fifty
other
counts
all
of
which
were
subject
wise
extracted
from
the
seized
papers.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
seized,
as
pointed
out
in
part
2a
of
the
argument,
even
though
the
warrants
were
discussed
in
great
detail
and
passed
around
and
a
matter
of
fact
the
hearing
held
comprised
approximately
a
day-and-a
half
of
argument
and
testimony,
they
were
never
--
the
warrants
were
never
actually
formally
introduced
and
as
pointed
out
in
1a,
although
a
technicality,
we
feel
that
the
non-introduction
of
the
warrants
a
technicality
under
our
laws
of
evidence
that
cannot
be
dispensed
with
or
at
least
some
reason
be
shown
why
they
were
not
introduced.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir
or
an
explanation
to
be
made
as
to
why
the
warrant
is
not
available.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir,
your
honor
and
i
believe,
in
bumper
this
court
referred
to
a
very
similar
case
in
north
carolina
where
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
it
is
just
i
believe
is
basic,
is
back
to
basic
best
evidence
rule
that
if
you
intend
to
prove
that
a
certain
document
exists
and
that
it
was
used
in
the
auspice
of
it
were
heart
of
the
proceeding
that
that
it
is
necessary
to
introduce
that
article
into
evidence
or
explain
why
it
cannot
be
produced.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
state
does
not
quarrel
with
the
theory
of
law
there
just
to
expounded
to
you,
your
honor.
they
just
feel
that
the
non-introduction
was
overcome
by
certain
things
which
are
set
out
in
the
court
of
special
appeals
opinion.
now,
following
that,
the
suppression
hearing,
the
trial
court
required
the
state
to
establish
a
nexus
under
warden
v.
hayden,
that
is
a
connection
between
the
articles,
the
individual
papers
seized
and
the
crimes
or
the
intent
or
the
mens
rea
behind
the
crimes.
now,
at
this
point,
the
state
went
back
into
a
huddle,
stayed
overnight
and
completely
went
through
the
papers,
disregarded
approximately
75%
of
them
as
pertaining
to
other
indictments
which
they
were
not
pressing
at
that
time.
of
the
balance,
because
of
the
necessity
of
opening
the
file
and
looking
at
each
paper
rather
than
establishing
the
connection
of
the
complete
file
and
why
the
officers
seized
it,
went
through
the
papers
and
eliminated
the
majority
of
what
was
left.
so
that
when
they
got
through,
they
had
only
a
handful
which
could
easily
be
held
in
one
hand.
again,
i
do
not
know
the
count,
but
only
a
handful
of
papers
upon
which
the
trial
court
did
not
suppress.
at
this
point
it
is
important
to
point
out
the
argument
in
part
2b
which
refers
to
the
motives,
excuse
me
2d,
and
i
will
refer
it
to
2d,
the
motives
of
the
prosecutor
as
espoused
by
warden
v.
hayden,
at
page
34
of
petitioner's
brief,
the
language
in
warden
v.
hayden,
referring
to
mere
evidence
states,
and
i
so
quote,
“that
probable
cause
must
be
examined
in
terms
of
cause
to
believe
that
the
evidence
sought
would
aid
in
a
particular
apprehension
or
conviction.
in
so
doing
consideration
of
police
purposes
will
be
required.”
at
this
point,
i
think
it
is
evident
from
the
facts
as
to
what
the
prosecutor’s
motives
were
at
this
particular
point.
they
used
the
facts
as
espoused
in
the
search
warrant
to
obtain
a
warrant,
search
the
premises,
waited
two
weeks
of
sifting
through
the
material
seized,
not
even
knowing,
as
is
obvious
from
the
testimony
of
the
investigators
involved,
what
the
papers
were,
then
using
these
as
a
basis,
obtained
50
additional
indictments
based
on
the
information
in
the
paper
seized.
then
consolidated
the
original
bill
of
information
with
one
of
the
indictments
which
contained
about
17
counts
for
a
trial
at
the
same
time.
and
then
at
time
of
the
trial,
even
though
he
failed
to
establish
a
prima-facie
case
throughout
the
entire
case
and
the
judge,
trial
judge
refused
to
allow
admission
at
that
time,
was
able
to
admit
this
evidence
under
the
proving
allegations
and
the
testimony
which
applied
to
the
additional
indictments
which
in
fact
were
obtained
under
the
search.
the
indictments
could
not
have
been
attained,
had
the
search
not
been
performed
and
the
extent
of
the
search
has
been
so
general
that
they
could
seize
all
the
papers
involved,
with
all
these
other
indictments.
we,
therefore,
say
that
under
warden
v.
hayden,
an
examination
of
the
prosecutor’s
motives
should
have
caused
the
non-introduction
of
this
evidence.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
no
sir.
i
do
not
think
the
evidence
even
though
not
suppressed
could
have
ever
been
introduced
had
it
not
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
because
--
i
am
not
referring
to
each
and
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
it
had
been
obtained
under
the
search
and
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
--
and
used
to
--
not
only
a
general
warrant
which
is
part
of
the
argument,
but
the
papers
were
used
to
obtain
indictments.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
search,
but
they
were
obtained
because
of
mens
rea
and
it
was
that
the
prosecutor
maintains
that
these
papers
showed
a
criminal
intent
prior
to
the
time
that
these
acts
were
permitted,
and
therefore,
even
though
they
were
from
years
past
that
the
criminal
intent
maintained,
was
maintained
by
petitioner
at
the
time
he
committed
the
acts
which
was
the
subject
to
the
warrant.
then
while
obtaining
the
information
because
it
had
to
do
with
the
mens
rea,
he
then
went
and
obtained
50
additional
indictments
for
the
crimes
which
he
said
were
part
of
the
criminal
scheme.
and
then
at
the
time
of
trial,
i
know
it
is
difficult
to
follow
this,
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
when
he
is
attempting
to
prove
the
initial
counts
of
the
causation
of
the
probable
cause
to
search
the
premises,
he
could
never
get
this
information
introduced
because
the
trial
judge
never
felt
that
a
prima-facie
case
was
established
under
the
evidentiary
rule
so
that
the
only
way
you
could
get
them
into
evidence
was
through
the
major
part
of
this
case
referring
to
those
particular
indictments
and
my
argument
is
that
his
motives
are
so
obvious
to
low
the
jury
with
evidence
of
papers
of
various
and
a
multitudes
of
crimes
and
numbers
of
counts
in
order
to
obtain
a
conviction.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
plus
a
consolidated
indictment
which
contained
17
of
the
later
obtained
counts,
in
other
words,
it
was
at
21
counts.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
all
of
them,
all
17
in
additional
counts.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
there
still
would
have
been
healthy
handful
hands.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
they
said
they
were
relevant
to
the
criminal
scheme
of
intent.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
they
never
would
have
been
able
to
have
been
introduced.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
they
are
not
because
the
trial
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
the
prosecutor
attempted
over
and
over
to
have
them
introduced,
but
under
an
evidentiary
rule
in
maryland,
mckean
v.
state,
you
cannot
introduce
evidence
of
other
crimes
or
criminal
intent
until
you
have
first
established
a
prima-facie
case
on
the
major
part
of
your
case.
and
the
trial
judge
ruled
over
and
over
that
this
prima-facie
case
had
never
been
established
and
only
when
the
prosecutor
turned
to
the
proofs
of
the
additional
indictments
was
he
able
to
get
the
evidence
in.
and
that
is
the
what
--
the
maintenance
of
--
turning
then
to
the
last
part
of
the
second
section
--
second
question
and
it
is
at
2c
which
had
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
is
that
it
was
complained
off
which
is
a
completed
act
and
even
that
the
issuing
judge
found
that
it
was
being
committed
at
the
time
and
we
complained
that
it
could
not
have
been
committed
because
under
the
facts
if
there
was
such
a
crime
that
had
been
complete
months
before
and
that
the
information
used
was
stale
as
well
and
turning
to
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
the
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
it
was
objected
at
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
that
under
the
hill
v.
philpott
case
that
petitioner’s
privileges
under
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
his
business
and
personal
papers
which
were
seized,
and
therefore,
has
set
forth
in
argument
section
1,
the
papers,
even
if
the
warrant
were
held
to
be
reasonable,
could
not
be
introduced
over
petitioner’s
objection
because
they
will
violate
his
fifth
amendment
rights
against
self
incrimination.
now,
at
the
time
that
these
articles
were
in
fact
introduced
at
the
trial,
petitioner
continued
to
object
and
he
is
finally
reminded
by
the
trial
court
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
continue
to
object
if
the
record
would
show
that
the
objection
was
sustaining
against
all
the
article
seized.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
this
comes
down
to
the
distinction
between
the
cases
as
to
how
you
define
compulsion.
now,
black
says
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
definitely.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
the
compulsion
was
the
taking
of
the
papers
from
him.
now
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
that
is
the
ruling
of
the
o'brien
case
that
the
one,
if
the
searchers
do
all
the
work,
then
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
hand
over
the
papers,
that
he
is
not
compelled
to
do
anything
and
that
is
--
we
say
that
is
wrong.
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
we
got
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
there
are
no
cases
at
least
upon
my
examination
of
all
the
cases.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
i
would
--
we
feel
that
the
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
that
is
a
question
as
to
what
would
the
framers
of
the
constitution
meant
when
they
said
that
he
shall
not
be
compelled
to
give
evidence
which
will
tend
to
incriminate
him.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
it
is
obvious
if
somebody
is
tortured
and
compelled
to
testify
that
this
less
obvious
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
no
not
the
gun
because
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
however,
he
is
not
testifying
by
the
gun
in
my
impression.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
we
feel
that
boyd
and
other
cases,
bellis
and
other
cases,
couch
have
set
forth
that
one’s
personal
papers
are
protected
and
taking
evidence
form
one’s
papers
is
the
same
as
from
his
own
mail.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
i
have
to
contend
that
mainly
that
we
need
examination
of
papers
first
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
is
compelled
testimony.
if
their
thoughts
and
ideas
expressed
in
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
or
the
appellate
court
whoever
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
on
counterfeit
money,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
could
be
a
thought,
i
mean
i
think
that
that
is
more
of
an
object
such
as
a
gun
or
something
in
that
nature.
i
think
that
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
but
it
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
the
question
is,
if
it
contains
his
thoughts
and
ideas.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
if
we
look
at
the
paper,
and
all
i
am
asking
is
that
the
trial
court
look
at
the
paper,
when
the
objection
is
interposed
you
say
that
this
paper
is
not
a
private
thought,
it
is
not
communicative
with
testimonial
nature,
and
therefore,
your
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
protected.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
that
is
our
only
request
that
they
look
at
it,
instead
of
what
the
trial
court
did
and
the
appellate
court
did
and
say,
we
do
not
care
what
the
paper
was,
the
search
was
reasonable,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
compulsion
attached.
they
can
take
anything
they
please,
be
it
diary,
be
it
personal,
be
it
business,
no
matter
what
it
is
because
the
search
was
reasonable.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
no
sir.
but
the
--
this
times
it
was
offered
and
received
in
evidence,
the
objection
was
interposed
continuously
again
and
again
that
the
paper
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
it
must
be
a
factual
standard
and
that
would
have
to
be
set
out
by
cases
dealing
with
the
papers.
now,
obviously
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
i
think
this
is
much
--
i
know
and
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that.
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
physical
compulsion
attached
in
a
force
seizure
of
one’s
papers
from
his
premises,
being
under
warrant
or
not,
that
there
is
and
be
forced
to
testify.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
he
is
not
performing,
but
my
explanation
of
compulsion
is
there
is
the
force
and
that
is
what
black
and
valentine
say
it
is.
that
is
the
force
which
makes
you
move
or
the
force
which
makes
you
do
which
maybe
unavoidable.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
and
made
me
stand
aside
and
let
them
search
and
i
objected
over
and
over
again
to
the
search.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
there
is
still
would
have
been
a
breaking
on
my
doors
and
taking
of
my
files
and
that
is
the
force
compelling
me
to
give
up
the
papers.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
thank
you.[laughter]
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
i
do
not
know
it.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
well,
that
is
a
question
that
has
been
forwarded
by
the
federal
government.
as
to
tapping
of
phones,
and
i
really,
i
think
that
is
why
the
rules
as
to
authorizing
such
search
warrants
are
getting
stricter
and
stricter.
that
the
question
is
as
to
conversations
between
peoples
and
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
and
i
was
able
in
my
own
mind
due
to
shortness
of
time
i
had
to
answer
the
federal
brief
which
i
just
received,
feel
that
because
i
was
talking
about
papers
i
did
not
really
fully
research
it.
i
cannot
really
answer
that.
again
--
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
alright
sir.
i
will
reserve
this
five
minutes.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
the
principles
of
boyd,
i
do
not
agree,
have
been
rejected
by
schmerber
and
gilbert,
as
a
matter
of
fact
both
cases
were
cited
and
maintained
the
boyd
rule.
gilbert
used
the
language
as
to
relating
to
a
hand
writing
exemplar
that
in
contrast
to
the
content
of
what
is
written,
like
the
voice
or
body
itself
is
only
an
identifying
characteristic
and
schmerber
on
the
same
rationale
--
mapp
did
not
reject
the
fifth
amendment
holdings.
i
do
not
have
a
definite
citation
in
front
of
me.
the
question
is,
is
whether
we
are
talking
about
the
content
of
the
testimony
or
the
communication
from
it
or
whether
it
is
as
to
what
is
written
there
itself.
in
dallas,
boyd
has
been
reiterated
by
the
words
of
justice
marshall
and
quoting
from
boyd,
“it
has
long
been
established
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compulsory
self
incrimination
protects
an
individual
from
compelled
production
of
his
personal
papers
and
effects
as
well
as
compelled
oral
testimony.”
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
boyd
case
was
a
subpoena,
your
honor.
it
was
a
bill
of
lading
that
was
seized
which
was
held
to
be
testimonial
and
going
on
further
from
boyd
and
couch
and
hill
versus
philpott,
the
words
in
bellis
continue
to
say
that
privilege
applies
to
the
business
records
of
the
sole
proprietor
or
sole
practitioner
as
well
as
to
the
personal
documents
containing
more
intimate
information
about
the
individual’s
private
life.
now,
the
character
of
the
papers
was
never
raised
or
decided
below.
this
is
being
raised
by
both
the
state
and
the
federal
government
for
the
first
time
here.
the
fifth
amendment
contention
was
rejected
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
blank
case
and
the
fifth
amendment
contentions
at
the
time
of
the
trial
were
rejected
solely
because
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
warrant.
now,
the
question
is
now
going
through
the
appendix,
i
certainly
disagree
as
to
most
of
the
contentions
of
both
the
state
and
the
federal
government
as
to
the
items
here.
beginning
on
page
44
through
60,
are
all
handwritten
items,
which
were
established
to
be
in
petitioner’s
handwriting
in
which
the
court
of
special
appeal
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief,
were
among
the
most
important
items.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
if
the
papers
are
of
the
type
which
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment,
yes
sir.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
testimony
on
communicative
papers.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
oh!
very
importantly,
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
the
sole
amount
of
the
evidence,
the
fact
that
the
draft
and
the
finished
copy
were
different.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
the
test
were
that
these
thoughts
expressed
on
this
paper
were
never
expressed
to
anybody
else
that
these
were
kept
by
the
petitioner.
as
matter
of
fact
some
of
these
papers
were
taken
from
my
desk,
these
notations
were
never
in
finalized
form,
but
with
the
thoughts
and
working
out
the
figures
which
was
used
to
incriminate
the
fact
that
it
changed
and
that
items
were
deleted
at
the
time
of
settlement
was
the
whole
crux
in
mens
rea
argument
as
to
the
--
self
--
the
self
incriminating
acts
of
--
they
totaled
up
to
more
and
they
were
reduced
to
take
care
--
be
taken
cared
of
an
approach
to
this,
that
was
the
liens
exceeded
the
sale
price.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
you
need
to
show
that
it
is
your
own
self
creation
being
put
down
on
the
paper
or
something
that
you
are
maintaining
for
your
own
personal
ideas.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
yes
sir.
now,
the
important
thing
to
reiterate
is
that
these
questions
were
never
considered
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
court
relied
solely
on
the
blank
case.
now,
as
to
the
compulsion
question,
just
incidentally,
it
was
never
established
as
corporate
offices.
as
the
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony,
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
showed
otherwise
that
the
investigators
plus
the
affidavit
in
the
search
warrant
both
show
that
they
were
my
files
maintained
as
an
auxiliary.
that
in
both
vonderahe
in
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
and
in
shaffer
in
the
dissenting,
it
is
pointed
out
just
how
much
compulsion
is
involved
in
a
search
and
hill
versus
philpott
also
does
that.
mr.
peter
c.
andresen
not
at
all
sir.
i
could
point
to
specific
act.
