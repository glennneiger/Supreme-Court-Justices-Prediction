justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
stanford,
you
had
some
first
amendment
implications,
did
you
not,
whether
or
not
a
bookstore
search?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
reason
do
you
know
for
that
requirement
of
maryland
law
is
that
the
jury
would
not
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
state
quarrel
with
the
language
of
the
warrant
that
you
have
set
out
in
your
own
appendix?
i
mean,
is
there
a
dispute
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
standard
does
the
trial
court
apply
when
it
looks
at
it,
if
it
were
to
require
to
do
that
the
way
you
suggest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
focus
on?
i
mean,
your
response
to
justice
whiteâ€™s
question
indicated
that
you
did
not
certainly
contend
there
was
any
physical
compulsion
here.
what
should
the
trial
court
look
at?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
compulsion
is
not
on
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
again,
how
many
exhibits
were
or
admitted
in
evidence
as
a
result
of
all
these
searches?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
exhibit
2
for
example
is
made
up
i
see
of
13
letter
subsections?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hen
you
say
the
record
office,
would
that
be
the
county
record
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
trust
provided
for
partial
releases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think,
i
take
that
you
are
also
saying
that
where
there
were
mistakes
made,
it
was
not,
at
least
a
testimony
to
suppression
hearing
indicated
it
was
not
in
reliance
on
the
catch-all
clause,
but
in
the
mistakes
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
more
specific
language
of
the
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
type
of
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
a
draft
of
a
settlement
statement
come
within
that
definition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
fact
that
is
incriminating
though,
is
that
the
test,
if
it
is
incriminating,
it
is
covered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
that
simply
makes
your
definition
of
documents
coextensive
with
the
notion
of
incrimination?
you
do
not
need
to
show
anymore
about
documents
other
than
they
incriminate
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
draft
of
a
settlement
statement
has
the
same
standing
as
a
personal
diary?
