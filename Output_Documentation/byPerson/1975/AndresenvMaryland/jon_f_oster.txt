mr.
jon
f.
oster
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
into
the
statement
of
the
case
and
the
facts
because
the
facts
are
so
important
in
this
type
of
case,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
solicitor
general’s
appendix
which
gives
you
an
example
of
the
type
of
exhibits
which
were
seized
from
mr.
andresen’s
office.
and
if
you
will
--
if
the
court
has
that
and
if
you
will
look
at
page
7,
it
is
very
faint,
but
if
you
will
find
it,
you
will
find
a
settlement
statement
for
buyer,
property,
lot
7,
block
t,
section
10,
potomac
woods,
it
is
dated
july
9,
1970.
it
is
clark
king
construction
co.,
inc.--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
it
is
the
yellow.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
it
is
page
7,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
it
is
very
faint.
now,
that
you
are
turned
to
this
small
print
and
if
you
will
also
turn
to
page
12
and
hold
page
12,
you
will
see
also
a
settlement
statement
there
for
seller
and
if
you
will
look
closely
you
will
see
that
both
pertain
to
lot
7,
block
t,
section
10,
potomac
woods.
the
seller
and
the
purchaser
are
the
same,
the
date
is
the
same
and
the
case
number
is
the
same,
case
#70-307.
now,
if
you
will
look
at
the
columns,
you
will
notice
in
the
debit
column
on
the
first
one
on
page
7,
it
is
48,000
and
then
you
will
notice
on
the
credit
on
page
12
it
is
48,000.
but
after
that
there
is
a
great
variance.
you
will
note
for
instance
that
the
buyer's
copy
makes
no
reference
to
the
payment
of
any
prior
liens
or
mortgages.
and
you
will
note
in
fact,
that
the
buyer's
copy
shows
that
the
first
mortgage
is
$38,000.00
whereas
if
you
look
on
page
12,
you
will
note
that
the
seller
received
notice
that
the
first
mortgage
was
$35,000.00.
he
also
received
notice
that
the
trust
to
the
state
national
bank
in
the
amount
of
$1,000.00
was
paid
off.
the
state
to
the
lumsden
trust
in
the
amount
of
$1,333.00
had
been
paid
off.
the
fourth
trust,
foday
(ph),
$2,000.00
have
been
paid
off.
federal
line
trust
had
been
paid
off.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
look
at
the
totals
for
the
two
settlement
sheets,
you
will
see
that
the
first
settlement
sheet
on
page
7
is
$50,487.61
and
you
will
see
that
the
total
for
page
12
is
$50,746.06.
now,
those
same
exhibits
in
the
petitioner’s
handwriting
are
also
on
pages
65
and
66
of
the
solicitor
general’s
appendix,
and
the
the
handwriting
and
you
will
see
that
there
is
a
different
settlement
statement
for
the
buyer,
it
is
identical
to
the
one
on
page
7
and
it
--
and
day
--
on
page
66
you
will
see
the
handwriting
for
the
seller’s
settlement
statement
and
again
the
seller
statement
does
not
correspond
with
the
buyer’s.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
right,
your
honor.
but
the
information
i
think
more
significantly
was
that
the
seller
was
being
made
aware
that
certain
liens,
prior
liens
were
being
paid
off.
the
buyer
had
no
notice
whatsoever.
but
the
information
of
course
received
by
the
buyer
was
that
all
liens
had
to
be
paid
off.
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
the
terms
of
the
first
mortgage
from
the
equitable
life
insurance
company,
they
would
never
provide
a
first
mortgage
unless
they
were
sure
that
all
prior
liens
had
been
paid
off.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
this
eventually
has
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
records
that
were
seized.
if
we
get
into
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
were
these
testimonial
or
communicative
or
whether
these
were
business
records.
i
wanted
the
court
to
be
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
records.
i
thought
it
was
good
to
have
the
records
in
your
context
before
i
presented
the
case.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
these
are
representative
of
the
records
which
were
seized
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes,
your
honor.
now,
if
i
may
proceed,
i
only
have
about
five
minutes,
i
will
try
and
get
into
the
basic
statement
of
the
case
and
then
after
lunch
i
will
return
to
the
facts
which
setup
the
probable
cause
for
the
application
for
the
search
warrant.
the
petitioner,
mr.
andresen
is
an
attorney
at
law
in
montgomery
county
specializing
in
real
estate.
he
was
suspended
from
active
practice
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
on
june
9,
1975.
on
november
1,
1972
an
information
was
filed
against
him,
charging
him
with
four
counts
of
false
pretenses.
on
november
16,
1972,
he
was
indicted
by
the
montgomery
county
grand
jury
on
17
additional
charges.
the
indictment
and
the
information
were
consolidated
for
trial.
the
petitioner’s
case
was
removed
upon
his
motion
to
frederick
county
for
trial.
there
had
been
a
lot
of
publicity
in
the
newspapers
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area.
he
elected
a
jury
trial
which
was
presided
over
by
judge
samuel
w.
barrack
of
the
circuit
court
for
frederick
county
and
this
trial
lasted
over
one
week.
it
began
on
may
21,
1973.
before
the
trial
however,
on
april
11
and
april
12
in
1973,
a
two-day
hearing
was
conducted
on
the
petitioner’s
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
seized
from
his
law
office.
as
a
result
of
that
hearing,
the
state
was
left
with
17
items
of
evidence
of
which
it
chose
to
introduce
five
exhibits
into
evidence
and
those
five
exhibits
are
the
exhibits
which
are
listed
in
the
solicitor
general’s
appendix.
i
should
point
out
here
so
that
there
is
not
any
confusion
that
their
--
the
search
--
there
were
two
searches,
conducted
on
october
31.
one
of
the
petitioner’s
law
office
located
at
3700
decatur
avenue
and
the
other
located
at
his
corporate
offices.
he
had
a
number
of
corporations.
among
them
mount
vernon
development
corporation
and
kensington
corporation.
and
these
records
are
--
the
location
of
these
corporations
was
about
five
blocks
away,
3514
priers
mill
road.
both
searches
commenced
at
the
same
time.
and
52
items
or
exhibits
were
seized
from
the
corporate
offices
at
3514
priers
mill
road.
only
one
of
them
was
eventually
introduced.
all
the
rest
were
either
suppressed
or
they
were
returned
by
the
state.
i
think,
however,
pretty
clearly
under
the
bellis
case
which
mr.
justice
marshall
wrote
that
these
were
corporate
offices
and
were
not
dealing
with
the
same
constitutional
problems.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
three
counts
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
first
three
exhibits
b,
c
and
d
on
the
first
three
pages
of
the
solicitor
general’s
appendix.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
they
are
the
exhibits
which
are
listed
in
the
table
of
contents.
and
there
are
few
handwriting
exemplars
which
have
not
been
included,
but
they
are
basically
2,
3,
4,
10a
was
--
while
10a
was
introduced
--
it
had
to
do
with
a
charge
concerning
the
misrepresentation
of
the
stamp
tax
that
was
due
to
montgomery
county,
and
that
was
withdrawn
so
that
is
really
not
relevant.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
right.
that
was
a
file.
that
was
one
file
and
this
was
the
contents
of
the
file.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
on
that
one,
clark
king.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes.
that
was
their
purchase
and
that
relates
to
the
settlement
sheets
that
i
have
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
when
i
started.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
three
counts
of
fraudulent
misappropriation
by
a
fiduciary
in
contravention
of
article
27,
section
132
of
the
code
of
maryland
and
five
counts
of
false
pretenses.
he
received
eight
concurrent
2-year
sentences.
after
appealing
to
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland,
that
court
reversed
the
petitioner’s
convictions
on
four
of
the
five
counts
of
false
pretenses
because
the
necessary
element
of
the
offense,
the
intent
to
defraud
had
not
been
alleged
in
the
indictment.
the
court
of
special
appeals
rendered
its
decision
on
january
10,
1975.
cert
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
on
march
31t,
1975
and
thereafter
this
court
granted
cert.
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
petitioner
seeks
reversal
of
conviction
on
one
count
of
false
pretenses
relating
to
lot
13t
in
section
10
of
potomac
woods.
this
is
a
development
in
montgomery
county
and
all
of
the
charges
flow
out
of
section
10
of
potomac
woods
and
three
counts
of
misappropriation
of
funds
by
a
fiduciary
relating
to
mr.
and
mrs.
richard
pullets,
mr.
and
mrs.
seth
moorefield,
and
mr.
and
mrs.
robert
holtsclows
(ph)
who
purchased
lots
12s,
25r
and
7t
respectively
in
section
10
of
potomac
woods.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
thank
you
your
honor.[luncheon
break]
mr.
jon
f.
oster
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
simply
finishing
up
a
statement
of
the
case.
the
evidence
seized
from
mr.
andresen’s
law
office
pertains
only
to
the
false
pretense
charge
relating
to
lot
13t
and
the
misappropriation
of
funds
by
a
fiduciary
charge
relating
to
the
purchase
of
lot
7t
by
the
holtsclows.
furthermore,
most
of
the
items
of
evidence
relating
to
lot
7t
which
were
seized
from
the
petitioner’s
law
office
are
duplicates
of
evidence
from
other
sources
which
were
introduced
at
this
trial
through
other
witnesses.
so
this
means
that
there
could
be
the
possible
application
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
if
the
court
wish
to
apply
it
because
only
two
of
the
possible
charges
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
out
of
four,
two
relate
to
independent
testimony
and
independent
exhibits
of
evidence
totally
unrelated
to
the
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
the
counterpart
relates
to
one
of
the
charges,
the
holtsclows,
fraudulent
misappropriation.
that
was
lot
7t
and
that
was
the
example
of
the
two
settlement
sheets
that
i
showed
you.
but
that
--
they
also
introduced
identical
exhibits
through
the
holtsclows
themselves.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
right.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
the
other
counts
relate
to
test?
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes,
if
it
is
a
flaw,
the
other
counts
relate
to
fraudulent
misappropriation
charges
and
the
evidence
in
the
testimony
there
are
totally
unrelated
to
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
evidence
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes
they
were.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
7
you
will
see
that
a
copy
of
this
document
was
also
introduced
as
part
of
the
state’s
exhibit
29
from
robert
holtsclows'
record,
transcript
131
and
if
you
look
at
page
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes
sir.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
correct.
the
material
that
was
seized
from
the
--
from
the
office
applied
principally
to
the
false
pretense
counts
against
lot
13t.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
the
counts
relating
to
the
pullets
and
the
count
relating
to
the
moorefields.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
correct.
that,
that
evidence
was
introduced
by
the
--
by
the
pullets
and
moorefields
themselves.
they
testified
and
they
introduced
their
documents.
and
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes.
i
think
--
well
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
no
it
does
not.
no.
i
think
it
was
in
benton
versus
maryland
that
--
it
certainly
does
not
bar
your
consideration
of
the
substance
issue
here.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
no
i
did
not,
your
honor.
we
--
i
overlooked
it.
however,
it
is
very
clear
that
--
is
that
the
option
of
the
supreme
court
is
to
whether
or
not
you
wish
to
apply
this
doctrine.
i
think
that
i
am
going
to
have
to
go
into
somewhat
into
the
factual
background
which
led
to
the
search
and
seizure
of
this
--
because
the
petitioner
has
rested
so
much
his
testimony
as
to
the
issues
of
probable
cause
and
the
background
of
it
and
i
feel
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court.
in
early
1972,
the
washington
posted
did
some
expose
articles
on
real
estate
settlements
in
the
metropolitan
area.
there
was
some
evidence
that
there
had
been
abuse
in
the
montgomery
county
and
prince
george’s
county
area
and
the
state's
attorney’s
offices
of
those
two
counties
setup
a
bi-county
fraud
unit,
as
initially
set
up
it
consisted
of
three
people,
a
mr.
moyers,
a
mr.
lawrence
and
a
mrs.
knowles.
mrs.
knowles
started
working
in
the
record
office
at
montgomery
county
and
among
the
persons
that
you
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
right,
the
county
record
office
and
they
were
looking
at
some
of
these
real
estate
transactions.
the
pullets
who
were
--
one
of
the
charges
here
the
fraudulent
misappropriation
charge,
were
going
to
sell
their
house
in
july
of
1972
and
discovered
that
there
were
several
liens
on
the
property
which
had
never
been
released.
of
course
they
had
been
led
to
understand
by
the
petitioner
who
handled
their
real
estate
settlement
that
all
the
liens
had
been
released
and
of
course
they
would
not
have
received
their
first
mortgage,
if
the
liens
had
not
been
released.
a
complaint
was
given
to
the
state's
attorney’s
office
and
to
the
bi-county
fraud
unit
and
they
did
start
investigating
both
the
pullets
and
the
moorefields
and
the
holtsclows
because
they
were
basic
deeds
of
trust
which
covered
all
of
the
section
10
of
potomac
woods
so
that
they
did
have
some
evidence
that
there
were
deeds
of
trust
outstanding
and
that
they
had
not
been
released.
these
deeds
of
trust
would
be
a
basic
financing
situation
where
a
financial
institution
would
loan
$37,000.00
to
a
builder
and
the
builder
would
give
a
deed
of
trust
which
covered
a
great
many
lots
and
of
course
as
a
lot
was
sold
--
was
sold
you
would
pay
a
portion
of
the
--
of
the
lot
of
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes
it
did,
all
of
them.
as
the
background
of
this,
in
1967,
clark
king
who
was
the
builder
and
who
is
using
the
petitioner
exclusively
as
his
real
estate
attorney
for
handling
settlements,
was
having
difficulty
paying
off
his
contractors.
the
petitioner
agreed
with
clark
king,
this
is
the
name
of
the
company,
it
is
mr.
clark,
to
maintain
a
running
account
whereby
he
would
ostensibly
lay
out
money
for
clark
king,
so
that
a
free
and
clear
title
could
be
delivered.
clark
testified
at
the
petitioner’s
trial
that
he
thought
this
was
a
lending
arrangement
under
which
the
petitioner
would
be
repaid
once
sales
improved.
clark
thought
that
the
debts
secured
by
the
deeds
of
trust
on
the
various
lots
were
being
paid
off
so
that
good
titles
were
being
delivered
at
the
time
of
settlement.
the
deeds
of
trust
and
other
encumbrances
were
listed
on
the
seller’s
settlement
sheet
as
i
have
already
illustrated
to
you.
however,
the
evidence
at
the
trial
indicated
that
the
encumbrances
were
frequently
not
being
released.
there
were
two
deeds
of
trust
covering
lot
13t,
that
is
the
false
pretenses
charge,
the
principal
one
against
the
petitioner.
as
security
on
a
note
for
$31,000.00,
clark
king
executed
a
deed
of
trust
to
state
national
bank
on
a
number
of
potomac
woods
lots,
including
lot
13t.
this
deed
of
trust
was
recorded
on
august
2,
1968.
a
security
on
another
note
in
the
amount
of
$24,000.00,
clark
king
executed
the
deed
of
trust
to
author
dale
lumpstien
(ph)
in
the
amount
of
$24,000.00
on
a
number
of
potomac
woods
lots.
this
deed
of
trust
also
included
lot
13t,
so
there
were
two
deeds
of
trust.
actually
there
was
an
--
was
a
third
one
as
well.
excuse
me,
there
were
two
on
13t,
two
deeds
of
trust.
the
second
deed
of
trust
was
recorded
on
october
9,
1968.
mr.
andresen,
the
petitioner,
was
the
trustee
on
the
deed
of
trust
to
the
state
national
bank
and
was
personally
responsible
for
signing
any
releases
for
individual
lots.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
no,
it
does
not.
i
thought
if
the
court
is
interested
i
will
go
to
that
your
honor
but
i
thought
since
the
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
i
realized
that
the
solicitor
general,
the
solicitor
general
will
discuss
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
will
get
to
that,
but
i
was
concerned
about
the
probable
cause
arguments
that
had
been
registered
by
the
petitioner
and
that
is
why
i
was
going
into
it.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes
they
have.
i
will
move
into
the
--
if
the
business
records
--
if
it
is
the
wish
of
the
court.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
there
were
a
number
of
issues.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
was
one
of
the
arguments
that
it
was
a
general
warrant
because
of
the
language
attached
to
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
i
would
say
first
that
the
court
of
special
appeals
pointed
to
the
great
particularity
and
i
think
if
you
look
in
the
record,
you
will
see
the
great
particularity
that
is
recited
in
the
warrant
and
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
attached
any
significance
to
those
last
three
or
four
words
that
--
we
are
on
the
--
i
think
it
is
page
90
--
i
think
that
is
--
96
together
with
other
fruits
instrumentalities
and
evidence
of
crime
at
this
time
unknown.
time
is
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
i
am
saying
that
all
of
the
evidence,
all
of
the
evidence
related
to
either
lot
13t
or
it
related
to
the
holtsclows'
lot
which
was
7t
and
the
holtsclows'
lot
was
secured
by
a
deed
of
trust
which
also
secured
13t,
so
there
was
a
relationship.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
no,
no.
there
are
two
wherefore
clauses
in
the
application
for
a
warrant
and
in
the
second
--
in
the
second
wherefore
clause
they
specifically
refer
to
the
state
national
bank
deed
of
trust
and
that
deed
of
trust
covered
both
lot
13t
and
the
holtsclows'
lot
which
was
7t.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes.
my
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
there
was
to
rummaging
and
searching.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
there
was
no
rummaging
or
searching.
the
proceeding
on
the
motion
to
suppress
took
two
days.
there
was
a
--
it
took
about
two-and-a-half,
it
started
at
10:30
in
the
petitioner’s
office,
but
if
they
waited
another
half
hour
for
the
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
they
were
--
many
documents
were
returned
by
the
state’s
attorney.
other
documents
were
suppressed
by
the
court
because
there
was
no
nexus.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
the
search
and
i
--
that
the
search
was
conducted
in
conformance
with
the
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
no.
the
only
reason
for
suppression
was
that
there
was
no
nexus
or
that
they
were
irrelevant,
but
as
far
as
the
specificity
is
concerned,
i
think
in
the
record
of
the
suppression
hearing
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
did
the
warrant
specify?
no.
i
do
not
thing
it
did.
the
warrant
was
very,
very
carefully
drawn.
the
warrant
was
extremely
carefully
drawn
and
they
were
looking
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
there
was
a
return
on
the
warrant
with
29
items
and
they
are
listed
on
the
return.
of
those
items,
eleven
items
were
either
suppressed
by
the
court
or
they
were
returned
by
the
state
leaving
seventeen
items
and
out
of
those
seventeen
items,
the
state
elected
to
introduce
five
and
those
five
items
are
listed
in
the
appendix
of
the
solicitor
general’s
brief.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
to
the
extent
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
extent
that
they
relate
to
lot
13t
or
to
the
extent
that
they
relate
to
the
deed
of
trust
to
the
state
national
bank
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
they
are
specifically
identified.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
they
had
no
nexus
with
lot
13t
or
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
there
is
testimony
in
the
suppression
proceedings
in
which
--
which
they
go
into
great
detail
as
to
how
they
were
trying
to
identify
the
material.
they
went
into
a
law
office
and
they
found
files,
a
lot
of
files
on
tables.
some
files,
there
is
testimony
that
the
filing
system
was
something
that
the
investigators
were
not
familiar
with.
there
was
one
comment,
it
was
helter-skelter.
some
files
related
to
section
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
no.
in
the
cross
examination
of
the
investigators,
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
went
into
that
in
great
detail
and
they
emphasized
that
they
were
trying
to
relate
it
to,
they
knew
about
three
deeds
of
trust
and
they
also
knew
about
lot
13t
which
is
set
out
in
the
affidavit,
and
everything
that
they
attempting
to
seize
related
to
those
items.
now,
they
did
make
mistakes
as
they
were
pulling
certain
files.
but
they
had
to
make
some
kind
of
a
cursive
research
of
certain
files.
for
instance,
they
knew
that
most
of
the
lots
they
were
concerned
with,
that
they
knew
that
there
were
deeds
of
trust
that
had
not
been
released
were
in
section
10
of
potomac
woods
and
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
what
he
said?
mr.
jon
f.
oster
i
cannot
--
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
if
i
had
the
time,
i
can
certainly
find
them
for
you,
your
honor,
in
the
proceedings.
it
is
in
the
proceedings.
there
is
a
450
word
transcript,
375
pages
of
which
relate
to
the
motion
to
suppress
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
i
regret
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
i
regret
that
and
i
am
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
i
did
not
bring
the
case
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
right.
they
were
papers
relating
to
lot
13t
or
they
were
papers
that
related
to
the
deeds
of
trust
and
both
of
which
are
set
forth
in
the
application
to
the
warrant.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
i
think
under
the
factual
circumstances
that
when
you
go
into
a
law
office,
it
is
got
to
be
expected
that
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
readily
identify
something
right
away.
they
tried
--
mr.
jon
f.
oster
yes.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
that
is
right
and
the
state
recognized
and
the
state
at
the
suppression,
at
the
suppression
proceeding
the
state
returned
a
lot
of
documents
voluntarily.
the
real
reason
for
the
length
of
the
suppression
hearing
is
that
they
went
through
every
document.
they
would
go
through,
they
would
go
into
a
file
and
take
each
document
one
by
one,
the
judge
would
rule.
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
more
and
that
i
will
just
take
a
minute
to
refer
to
the
fifth
amendment.
the
state
feels
that
under
couch
and
under
the
blank
case
that
these
are
business
records,
i
would
point
out
that
this
was
not
a
subpoena.
this
was
a
valid
search
and
seizure
and
that
we
believe
that
the
nature
of
the
records
are
such
that
they
are
not
testimonial
or
communicative
that
those
terms
do
not
seem
to
be
applied.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
i
do
not
know
that
this
court
has
said
that
if
they
are
testimonial
and
communicative,
they
are
barred.
mr.
jon
f.
oster
well,
i
would
say
the
compulsion
applies
when
there
is
a
subpoena
and
the
petitioner
is
required
to
come
and
identify
the
documents
himself.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
compulsion
when
there
is
a
valid
search
and
seizure
and
the
search
and
seizure
is,
you
know,
is
conducted
in
accordance
with
the
mandates
of
the
fourth
amendment.
thank
you.
