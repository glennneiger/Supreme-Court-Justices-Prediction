mr.
oster,
may
i
get
something
straight?
i
am
a
little
bit
confused.
in
answer
to
justice
white,
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
said
that
some
documents
were
suppressed
because
they
had
no
nexus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nexus
with
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
would
that
not
also
be
true,
they
did
not
have
a
nexus
with
the
particular
descriptions
in
the
warrant,
and
therefore,
probably
were
seized
pursuant
to
the
catch
all
clause
of
the
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
documents
were
seized
pursuant
to
the
catch-all
clause
rather
than
pursuant
to
the
specificity?
