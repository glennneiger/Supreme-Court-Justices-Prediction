justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
define
a
profession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
is
the
case,
why
doesn’t
he
write
a
prescription?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that’s
the
case,
why
doesn’t
he
write
prescriptions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
their
contraindication.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
some
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
weighing
your
submission,
the
state's
interest,
do
we
get
any
help
in
evaluating
the
state's
interest
out
of
williamson
and
those
other
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
can't,
you
can't
do
that
i
gather
from
what
you’re
suggesting,
your
next
step
is
going
to
be,
but
you
can't
do
that
as
to
assume
that.
well,
evaluating
the
conduct
of
a
professional
themselves
that’s
one
thing.
but
here
you’re
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
consumer
is
entitled
of
this
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
do
you
perceive
the
reasons
for
preventing
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
preventing
dissemination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
agree,
mr.
troy
that
this
prohibition
goes
so
far
as
to
prevent
the
pharmacist
from
putting
a
sign
even
on
his
prescription
counter
that
i
sell
such
and
such
for
a
$1.20?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
not
your
submission
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
suggestion
is
that
in
this
instance,
the
state
interest
does
not
override
the
right
to
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
wasn’t
i
alone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
lamont,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
anything
as
to
the
standing
of
these
people
to
sue
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
consumers
would
never
be
hurt
–
would
only
hurt
to
the
extent
that
the
druggist
would
advertise,
if
it
weren’t
for
this
long?
