mr.
troy,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
don’t
quite
understand
how
this
argument
addresses
the
question
that
you
have
presented
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment.
the
prohibition
of
price
advertising
is
a
violation
at
first
hand,
is
that
issue
we
have?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
everything
you’ve
been
saying
everything
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
can
understand
if
you
were
arguing
a
compelling
interest
argument
assuming
that
there
was
first
amendment
protection,
but
i
thought
the
question
you
gave
me
was
whether
or
not
commercial
advertising
had
first
amendment
protection?
