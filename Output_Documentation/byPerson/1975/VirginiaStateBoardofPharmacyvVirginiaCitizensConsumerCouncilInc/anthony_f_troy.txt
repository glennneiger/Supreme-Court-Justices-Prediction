mr.
anthony
f.
troy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
traditional
that
the
practice
of
professions
are
to
be
above
the
morals
of
the
marketplace.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
practice
of
pharmacy
in
the
dispensing
of
drugs
should
be
subject
to
the
morals
of
the
marketplace.
should
prescription
drugs
be
advertised?
the
concerns
of
this
case,
however,
are
not
only
in
the
profession
of
pharmacy
or
rather
in
each
and
every
profession,
law,
medicine,
optometry,
dentistry
and
any
other
profession
controlled
by
the
state.
the
true
question
then
is
the
ability
of
a
legislature
to
regulate
these
professions
within
the
economic
and
social
policies
deemed
provident.
in
virginia,
the
practice
of
pharmacy
is
a
profession.
it
has
been
deemed
a
profession
by
the
general
assembly.
it
has
been
found
a
profession
by
the
courts.
it
is
a
profession
from
the
time
that
the
pharmacist
procures
the
drug,
through
the
time
that
he
prepares
it,
compounds
it,
dispenses
it,
and
delivers
it
to
the
patient.
our
brief
in
footnote
3,
pages
six
and
seven,
sets
forth
some
of
the
statutes
which
comprise
the
scheme
by
which
the
profession
of
pharmacy
is
regulated
in
the
commonwealth.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
your
honor,
the
general
assembly
has
defined
this
profession.
it
has
defined
it
within
the
scheme
work
of
what
is
traditionally
been
defined
as
this
profession.
a
learned
profession
requirement
of
a
degree
or
requirement
of
some
protection
to
the
health,
safety
and
welfare
of
the
people.
and
in
this
case,
it
has
been
shown
and
not
only
by
statute
but
in
the
record
itself
that
the
pharmacist
is
the
last
professional
who
interposes
himself
between
a
patient
and
a
drug.
he
has
a
vital
role
in
the
medical
health
team.
in
1968,
the
virginia
general
assembly
enacted
a
measure
prohibiting
the
advertisement
of
the
price
of
prescription
drugs.
the
history
of
that
statute
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
page
20.
and
i
would
point
out
here
in
response
to
the
appellee’s
statement
that
the
legislature
enacted
this
without
any
basis
whatsoever.
the
short
answer
is
that
since
that
1968
enactment,
the
statute
has
been
enacted
or
amended
twice
with
full
knowledge
of
the
1969
federal
court
decision
sustaining
the
validity
of
the
statute.
and
the
legislature
declared
by
this
statute
than
any
pharmacist
who
advertised,
would
be
guilty
of
unprofessional
conduct.
the
statute
regulates
only
the
conduct
of
the
pharmacist.
as
the
appendix
demonstrates
and
as
judge
butzner
of
the
fourth
circuit
found
speaking
for
the
three-judge
court
in
patterson
drug
company
v.
kingery,
a
pharmacist
“must
have
an
extensive
knowledge
of
a
wide
range
of
drugs.
accuracy
is
essential.
mistakes
can
be
serious”.
just
four
pages
of
the
appendix,
pages
44
through
47
demonstrate
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
carl
m.
zwiller,
a
pharmacist
in
nearby
loudoun
county
that
a
pharmacist
plays
a
vital
role
in
the
health
field
and
the
dispensing
of
drugs.
a
pharmacist
in
dispensing
drugs
is
doing
more
and
what
i
as
layman
would
comprehend
that
is
taking
bottle
--
pills
from
a
big
bottle
counting
to
25
to
30
and
pouring
pills
into
small
bottle.
the
entire
educational
training
of
a
pharmacist
is
geared
to
impart
to
him
a
knowledge
greater
than
a
physician
as
relates
to
drugs,
their
chemical
composition
and
the
reactions,
contraindications
or
synergistic
effects
of
such
chemical
elements.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
i’m
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
the
reason
that
he
does
not
write
prescriptions
of
course
that
is
his
education
is
to
the
extent
of
knowing
the
chemical
elements
of
drugs
and
their
contraindications.
the
doctor
of
course
is
the
one
that
knows
what
the
therapeutic
affect
of
these
drugs
is
for
the
particular
disease
of
the
doctors
prescribing.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
and
their
contraindication
is
some
cases,
but
as
the
record
in
this
case—
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
is
in
some
cases,
yes
your
honor
because
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
pharmacist
do
keep
medical
profile
records
containing
a
patient’s
allergies,
sensitivities,
or
reactions
to
drugs.
for
example,
mr.
m
zwiller
detailed
again
on
the
appendix
pages
44
through
47.
two
instances
of
the
utilization
in
value
of
the
medical
profile
cards
among
typical
examples,
he
detailed
two
instances
where
medical
profile
record
assist
in
the
dispensing
of
drugs.
one,
an
example
of
a
patient
taking
a
blood
pressure
tablet
which
would
have
due
to
a
chemical
element
in
such
table,
potentially
aid
an
anesthesia
that
was
about
to
be
administered
prepared
toward
the
surgery.
another
specific
example
was
a
patient
taking
a
tranquilizer.
he
was
then
prescribed
the
different
type
of
tranquilizer.
the
second
one
had
what
was
known
as
an
mao
inhibitor.
in
short
a
drug
which
would
interfere
and
the
matter
in
which
the
body
was
utilizing
to
form
a
drug.
due
to
the
nature
of
these
drugs,
it
was
necessary
that
a
two-week
period
elapsed
prior
to
the
administration
of
the
second
drug
or
a
prolonging
and
intensifying
of
the
former
drug
would
occurred
in
the
body
was
serious
overdose
and
drug
side
effects.
the
record
before
this
court
does
demonstrates
that
the
profession
of
pharmacy
is
completely
entwined
into
dispensing
a
prescription
drugs.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
under
the
medical
profile
records
that
a
pharmacist
would
have
your
honor,
the
prescription
of
course
would
be
written
in
the
name
of
the
individual.
the
record
would
be
in
the
name
of
the
individual,
the
pharmacist
by
looking
at
the
record,
comparing
the
prescription
about
to
filled
could
tell
if
there
would
be
any
side
effects.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
can
he?
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes
he
can,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no
by
no
means.
it’s
universal.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
exactly
your
honor
and
as
judge
butzner
found
speaking
for
the
three-judge
court
that
although
monitoring
is
not
completely
effective
because
of
the
mobility
of
customers
or
because
of
the
availability
of
non-prescription,
otc
items
that
could
be
antagonistic.
it
is
not
a
perfect
cure,
but
it
is
a
benefit
to
the
public.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
that’s
exactly
correct
your
honor.
it
could
be
even
a
little
more.
but
the
point
is
as
pointed
out
in
the
appendix
that
today
as
compared
to
prior
years
when
druggist
used
to
compound
drugs,
today,
we’re
talking
about
drugs
that
have
a
benefit
of
curing
rather
than
just
a
palliative
affect
in
the
old
days
of
compounding
and
these
drugs,
while
they
have
the
benefit
of
curing,
have
also
the
benefit
and
ability
to
do
great
harm.
as
in
the
example
of
mr.
m.
zwiller
where
there
was
a
drug
that
he
dispensed
that
did
not
have
to
be
compounded.
nonetheless,
he
knew
that
if
he
gave
that
second
drug
that
that
patient
since
he
had
been
a
two-week
elapse
period
of
time
would
have
been
harmed
by
that
drug.
not
withstanding
that
it
was
a
drug
that
was
not
compounded.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes
it
does
your
honor
for
this
reason.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
correct
and
this
is
the
connection.
the
statute
here
is
a
major
addressed
to
the
public
health.
it
is
as
mr.
justice
stewart
found
in
head
and
has
described
similar
statutes
“within
the
most
traditional
concept
that
what
is
companiously
known
as
the
police
power.”
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
exactly,
yes
it
was
your
honor.
the
lower
court
paid
lip
service
only
to
the
principles
announced
in
these
cases
in
semler,
head,
williamson,
and
it
found
that
this
was
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
case
but
rather
was
a
first
amendment
case
because
it
violated
consumer’s
right
to
know.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes
your
honor
for
this
reason.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no
your
honor.
this
is
in
the
context
in
which
it
has
been
framed
for
us
by
the
lower
court,
a
first
amendment
case.
but,
the
lower
court
simply
ignored
fourteenth
amendment
cases
and
under
the
guise
of
the
first
amendment
then
examined
the
wisdom
of
the
virginia
statute
and
absent
a
convincing
explanation
for
its
wisdom,
it
struck
it
down.
now,
somehow
it
reasoned
that
approaching
this
from
a
consumer's
view
point
would
not
be
an
intrusion
upon
the
state’s
regulation
of
pharmacy.
i
suggest
that
court’s
decision
is
analytically
unsound.
it
has
set
war,
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments.
how
can
there
be
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
information
which
the
state
has
a
legitimate
and
constitutional
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
prohibiting
the
dissemination
of
that
very
same
information.
there
can
only
be
two
answers.
one,
that
the
right
to
know
is
a
concomitant
right.
it
is
not
an
independent
right
which
would
allow
access
to
any
information,
commercial
or
otherwise
which
perhaps
has
an
economic
impact
upon
the
consuming
public.
the
second
answer
is
that
an
independent
constitutional
right
would
exist
and
consequently
if
so,
semler,
head,
williamson
and
like
cases
must
be
over
ruled.
the
two
are
diametrically
apposed
and
cannot
stand
together.
now
this
court
has
not
granted
a
right
to
know
where
there
has
not
been
a
concomitant
first
amendment
right
to
speak.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no
your
honor,
it’s
a
health
matter.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
as
i’ve
indicated
--
let
me
answer
this
directly.
it’s
exactly
as
in
the
head
situation
where
the
statute
was
upheld
because
consumers
could
put
the
needs
of
their
pocket
books
above
their
remedial
needs.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no
your
honor.
as
an
attorney
with
some
antitrust
background,
i
would
be
the
first
to
concede
that
advertising
does
generate
price
competition.
but
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
that
the
general
assembly
in
its
wisdom
has
decided
that
the
delivery
of
a
prescription
drug
is
part
and
parcel,
entwined
with
the
health
care
that
must
be
given
--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
the
advertising
of
course
would
induce
consumers
to
think
of
this
as
a
mere
commodity
and
would
be
deceptive
in
and
of
itself
because
they
would
not
realize
what
the
general
assembly
--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
that
is
correct
your
honor.
this
has
no
effect
on
prices.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no
i
don’t
think
it
would
at
all.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
the
statute
does
not
intend
to
regulate
price.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
well
that
is
perhaps
an
analysis
justice
rehnquist
--
sorry
that
came
out.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
though
we
do
not
relay
on
that
analysis
per
se
in
the
lower
court.
what
we
felt
was
that
this
monitoring
situation,
if
you
have
advertising,
you’re
going
to
induce
patience
to
shop
around.
to
shop
from
pharmacy
to
pharmacy
and
by
not
having
price
advertising,
you
are
in
effect
creating
a
system
whereby
perhaps
a
physician,
pharmacist,
patient
relationship
would
exist.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no
sir.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
exactly,
and
the
fact
is
of
course
that
the
statute
does
not
in
anyway
intend
to
state
to
a
consumer
that
you
cannot
shop
around.
we
cannot
protect
our
consumers.
the
general
assembly,
however,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
found
that
there
was
a
rational
relationship
between
monitoring
--
between
having
patients
go
to
the
same
pharmacist
and
consequently
on
that
basis
enacted
the
statute.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
well,
in
those
cases
where
the
monitoring
has
worked
of
course
yes
your
honor.
the
record
would
show
that
there
are
examples
where
people
have
come
back
time
and
time
again
and
have
been
stopped
from
taking
antagonistic
drugs.
now,
to
remove
the
price
restrictions,
i
agree
create
retail
incentive
for
price
competition,
but
where
is
the
constitutional
right
to
the
lowest
price
possible.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes
it
would
your
honor.
there
is
under
the
patterson
v.
kingery
decision
which
was
in
1969
in
an
agreement
and
of
course
that
you
could
issue
a
discount.
when
that
case
first
came
before
the
court,
the
word
issue,
advertise
or
promote
a
prescription
drug
was
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
court
in
upholding
the
statute
struck
out
the
word
issue.
and
now
on
that
basis
of
course
senior
citizen
discount
plans
of
10%
have
been,
in
effect
in
the
commonwealth.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no
i
don’t
think
it
could
under
this
statute.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes
he
could
--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
you
could
or
you
could
go
down
to
the
next
pharmacist.
you
could
shop
around.
the
state
just
because
it
creates
a
system
which
it
feels
that
protects
health
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
you
as
a
consumer
have
to
accept
of
what
the
state
is
in
fact
trying
to
protect
you
from.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
the
first
amendment
interest
of
the
druggist
your
honor
brings
us
to
bigelow
--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no.
i
do
not
think
so
for
this
reason.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
well,
if
there
is
then
i
suggest
that
you
have
a
balancing
test
and
the
balancing
would
be
the
governmental
interest
in
regulating
versus
any
first
amendment
rights
that
maybe
existing
and
this
brings
us
to
this
court’s
recent
decision
of
bigelow.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
because
the
bigelow
is
simply
not
applicable
for
this
reason.
in
this
case,
what
is
advertised,
is
commercial
advertising
in
is
pure
sense.
phrases
such
as
compare,
safe,
pay
less
or
dial
a
discount
do
not
as
found
in
bigelow
convey
information
of
interest
regarding
reform,
the
subject
matter
of
the
law
in
another
state
or
advertise
activity
which
pertains
to
a
constitutional
interest,
abortion
in
bigelow.
such
phrases
do
no
more
and
simply
propose
a
commercial
transaction.
they
are
entitled
to
little,
if
any
constitutional
weight.
however,
as
i’ve
said
those
phrases
would
create
perhaps
a
retail
incentive
for
price
competition.
but
again
where
is
the
constitutional
right
to
the
lowest
price
possible?
trying
to
ensure
the
lowest
price
is
in
the
context
in
itself
a
wise
economic
policy.
it's
not
however
i
suggest
a
constitutional
pre-requisite.
for
example,
does
every
victim
of
an
anti
trust
price
fixing
conspiracy
have
a
cause
of
action,
for
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
not
withstanding
the
parker
brown
decision.
if
a
balancing
or
whatever
first
amendment
interests
are
involved
must
be
made
and
as
i
have
stated,
it
should
be
done
in
light
of
this
court's
recognition
for
over
40
years
for
the
inherent
interest
of
the
state
through
it's
police
power
to
regulate
the
various
professions.
since,
in
this
case
it
is
the
manner
by
which
price
information
is
disseminated
and
not
the
actual
dissemination
of
price
information
itself
that
is
regulated.
then
the
balancing,
if
any
must
be
done
as
it
was
in
mcdonald,
not
under
a
compelling
interest
doctrine
but
under
the
rational
relationship
test.
in
the
instant
case,
that
test
has
been
applied
and
the
statute
has
been
found
not
wanting.
it
has
been
found
by
a
district
court
whose
decision
was
declared
to
have
no
infirmity
by
the
lower
court,
to
have
a
statute
before
it
which
has
a
rationale
and
reasonable
basis.
the
virginia
statute,
wise
or
foolish,
economically
sound
or
improvident
should
be
sustained.
by
doing
so,
this
court
will
be
sustaining
the
constitutional
framework,
the
legislative
bodies,
not
courts
must
decide
the
wisdom
of
economic
and
social
policies.
we
cannot
and
should
not
turn
back
the
clock
for
40
years
under
the
guise
of
an
independent
right
to
know
which
would
begin
anew
the
scrutiny
of
wisdom
of
legislative
choices
in
the
health,
regulatory
and
other
professional
fields.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes
your
honor.
first
as
to
bigelow,
let
me
quote
from
their
brief
that
they
filed,
pages
28,
29
describing
the
advertisement
in
question,
“the
advertisement
contained
much
more
than
a
proposal
for
a
commercial
transaction.
the
information
that
new
york
had
legalized
abortions
was
important
not
just
to
persons
dealing
with
pregnancy
but
the
citizens
in
virginia
generally.
the
knowledge
that
other
states
had
altered
their
laws
on
such
a
controversial
subject
as
abortion
is
likely
to
have
a
tangible
impact
on
the
attitude
of
persons
concerning
restrictive
laws
in
their
own
state.”
well,
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
in
bigelow
and
it
is
i
suggest
the
argument
that
was
adapted
by
this
court,
when
it
found
that
the
advertisement
did
contain
certain
information.
now
--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
in
the
context
that
we
have
brought
it
to
this
court,
it
has
been
--
come
by
an
independent
right
to
know
granted
under
the
first
amendment
and
therefore
is
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
exactly.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
nothing
more
than
that
at
all.
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
in
the
context
that
the
court
decided
of
the
case
below,
it
was
decided
on
a
first
amendment
basis
and
the
entire
argument
that
we
are
presenting
is
that
that
first
amendment
basis
was
analytically
unsound.
how
can
you
regulate--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
no,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
there
cannot
be
a
first
amendment
right
to
know,
as
decided
by
the
lower
court
which
would
destroy
the
inherent
power
of
the
states
to
regulate
the
professions.
now,
i
sympathize
with
the
consumers
that
prices
are
high
and
as
they’ve
stated
in
their
brief
at
page
25,
the
effective
dissemination
of
drug
price
information
would
revive
competition
in
virginia,
reduce
the
price
of
prescription
drugs,
significantly
benefit
the
consumers
and
would
benefit
the
public
generally
by
implementing
sound
economic
and
social
policy
but--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
yes,
there
was
your
honor
but
that
was
overruled
and
it
was
a
overruled
on
the
very
basis
that
as
the
court
said,
the
patterson
case
concerned
pharmacy,
the
case
here
concerns
first
amendment
rights
of
consumers
to
know.
we
find
no
infirmity
in
the
patterson
case.
here
we
are
dealing
with
consumers.
i
suggest
that
you
cannot.
i
would
like
to
--
if
i
may,
just
close
by
indicating
two
things
--
mr.
anthony
f.
troy
well
as
i’ve
indicated
in
the
monitoring
situation
as
mr.
morrison
indicated,
if
a
doctor
prescribes
a
drug
that
is
bad,
we
have
a
malpractice
suit
on
our
hands.
why
does
the
state
have
to
await
a
malpractice
suit,
why
can’t
it
try
to
devise
a
scheme
whereby
a
pharmacist
can
stop
that
bad
drug
from
getting
into
the
hands
of
the
consumers?
i
suggest
that
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
we
don’t
have
to
wait
for
the
redress
of
citizens
harmed
by
drugs
through
malpractice
suits.
now,
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
case
of
head,
the
statute
there
“prohibits
advertising
by
any
means
whatsoever
the
quotation
of
any
prices
or
terms
on
eyeglasses.”
and
that
statute
was
upheld,
it
was
upheld
under
the
state's
power
to
regulate
sound
or
improvident,
the
state
regulated
in
that
manner
and
i
say
sound
or
improvident
here,
the
state
has
chosen
this
road
if
it
is
to
be
changed,
it
should
be
changed
by
the
consumers
at
the
ballot
box
and
not
in
the
court.
