justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you’re
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
type
of
analysis
where
you
talk
about
any
conceivable
side
effects,
don’t
you
have
to
get
back
to
justice
white’s
earlier
question
that
if
you
have
price
advertising
here,
you’re
going
to
have
price
wars
and
if
the
pharmacist
does
have
a
responsible
position,
the
less
he
can
charge
for
the
unit
of
the
less
time
he
is
able
to
devote
to
supervising
its
distribution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you’re
right
that
this
will
not
serve
the
virginia
statute
won’t
even
survive
a
rationale
basis
test,
i
would
think
you
could
prevail
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
on
the
first.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
constitutional
interest
that
you’re
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
your
argument
is
applied
to
the
legal
profession
putting
aside
the
antitrust
problem,
is
the
state
bar
regulation
prohibiting
lawyers
from
advertising
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
they
have
a
word
about
anything
else
in
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
how
do
you
know
what
was
in
the
back
of
their
minds,
how
do
you
know
that
monitoring
was
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
think
that
in
the
answer
to
furtherance
of
justice
blackmun’s
question,
that
the
physician
had
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
prescribe
in
the
generic
name
and
you
then
balance
the
state's
interest
to
see
whether
he
would
prevail
or
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
call
it
freedom
of
expression,
he
is
writing
on
a
prescription
pad
rather
than
speaking.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you’re
not
suggesting
are
you,
that
the
consumers
have
the
right
to
know
even
though
the
pharmacists
don’t
have
the
right
to
speak?
