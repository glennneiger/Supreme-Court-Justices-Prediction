justice

does
this
case
involves
on
an
action
for
declaration
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
an

justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
no
free
press
question
in
this
case
is
here?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
law
directed
at
all
against

justice
potter
stewart
or
only
against
pharmacist?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
criminal
sanctions?
justice
potter
stewart
no
criminal
sanctions
against
anybody?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
sanctions
against
pharmacist?
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
drummed
out
of
the
professional
way.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
being
asked
in
other
words
to
argue
your
opponents
case
now.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
law
is
directed
only
against
pharmacists.
it’s
not
directed
against
the
labor
unions
or
members
of
the
elks
or
anybody
else?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suggested
a
moment
ago
mr.
morrison,
i
think
that
this
was
almost
price
control
law,
was
there
anything
implicit
in
that
suggestion
that
a
state
would
violate
the
constitution
by
enacting
a
law
regulating
prices?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i’m
glad,
i
gave
you
an
opportunity.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there’s
a
policy
for
rightly
or
wrongly
or
rationally
or
irrationally
against
advertising,
price
advertising
by
pharmacists?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
that
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
you
stated
as
i
understood
you
that
it
would
depend
on
the
facts,
i’ll
try
to
put
a
fairly
straightforward
factual
situation.
as
you
know
most
lawyers
have
an
hourly
rate
at
least
for
internal
record
purposes.
and
the
first
step
in
most
legal
charge
computations
is
to
look
at
one
record
to
see
how
many
hours
have
been
devoted
to
their
representation.
let’s
assume
that
desire
on
the
part
of
lawyers
or
assume
that
the
issue
where
whether
or
not
lawyers
would
be
allowed
to
advertise
that
their
hourly
rate
for
non-litigation
advice
was
$25.00
an
hour,
whatever
it
might
be,
what
would
your
reaction
to
that
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
if
there
were
according
to
your
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
would
override
it,
and
if
there
is
a
right
to
know,
if
there
is
as
you
submit,
a
constitutional
right
to
know
on
the
part
of
potential
clients
or
potential
customers
or
pharmacist.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
if
there
is
a
right
to
know.
justice
potter
stewart
well
some
people
think
some
and
other’s
don’t.
others
think
if
there’s
a
clear
constitutional
right,
that’s
the
end
of
it
and
in
any
state,
the
statute
that
impedes
or
interferes
that
right
as
invalid.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
one
way
of
looking
at
it,
but
it’s
not
the
way
that
some
constitutional
lawyers
do.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
first
of
all,
on
an
absolutist
view
or
any
other
view,
you
have
to
look
at
the
constitution,
don’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
do
you
find
that
the
constitution
any
right
to
know?
justice
potter
stewart
strictly,
if
you’re
an
absolutist.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
may
fully
accept
that
and
still
say
that
the
constitution
protected
the
right
to
know
by
guaranteeing
the
right
to
speak
or
the
right
to
a
fair
press.
that’s
not
a
free
press.
and
that
those
are
the
constitutional
guarantees
and
anything
else
is
derivative
and
it’s
not
protected
directly
by
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
that
you
mean
that
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment
that
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
anything
more
than
that?
