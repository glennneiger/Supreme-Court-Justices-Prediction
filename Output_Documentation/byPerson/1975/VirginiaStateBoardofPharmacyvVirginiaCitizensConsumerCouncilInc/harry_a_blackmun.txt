justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
troy,
you’ve
mentioned
the
importance
of
drug
as
compounding
drugs,
as
i
understand
the
stipulation
95%
of
the
drugs
dispensed
do
not
require
compounding?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
that
they
do
go
the
same
pharmacist?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
this
law
reach
the
pharmacist
to
put
a
sign
on
his
prescription
counter
says
“i
sell
drugs
10%
less
than
you
can
buy
anywhere
else”?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
okay,
can
you
put
on
something
my
price
for
some
of
these
we’ll
say
achromycin
tablets
on
his
prescription
counter
as
$2.00,
they
do
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
troy,
i
wanted
to
be
sure
you
would
touch
upon
bigelow
because
you
didn’t
--
your
brief
of
course
was
filed
before
bigelow
came
down.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
haven’t
seemed
fit
to
file
a
supplemental
so
i’m
particularly
interested
in
your
comment.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
be
out
of
here,
if
in
fact
what
they
had
in
mind
and
said
so
was
we
think
it's
best
for
people
who
have
to
use
drugs,
patronize
a
single
dispenser
so
that
we
can
have
a
record
of
everything
that
the
patient
buys.
that’s
what
you
understand
to
be
monitoring?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
morrison,
let
me
ask
you
this
and
i
hope
it
isn’t
irrelevant.
i
think
it’s
a
fact
that
drugs
by
trade
names
generally
are
more
expensive
than
drugs
by
their
basic
–
chemical,
generic
name.
suppose,
virginia
had
a
statute
requiring
physicians
to
prescribe
in
the
generic
name,
would
this
be
unconstitutional?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
morrison,
maybe
this
is
why
i
for
one
anyway,
i
was
a
little
uneasy
about
using
the
phrase
such
as
the
right
to
know.
i
think
i’d
rather
plump
for
something
like
the
free
flow
of
information.
it
puts
a
little
less
emphasis
on
the
right
to
know
on
one
party
and
the
right
to
speak
from
the
other
and
we
have
restricted
them
here
a
little
bit.
and
i’m
groping
obviously.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
that
information
and
not
noise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
can
see
this
is
the
first
amendment
case,
of
course,
don’t
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i’ve
read
your
brief
this
is
the
first
amendment
case.
it
is
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case
in
your
view.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
the
appellees
are
consumers
of
prescription
drugs.
they
instituted
this
suit
against
the
virginia
state
board
of
pharmacy,
challenging
the
validity
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
a
virginia
statute
which
declares
it
to
be
unprofessional
conduct
if
a
licensed
pharmacist
advertises
the
prices
of
prescription
drugs.
the
district
court
declared
the
statute
void
and
enjoined
the
appellants
from
enforcing
it.
we
hold
that
these
consumers
enjoy
the
same
first
amendment
protection
that
advertisers
have
to
disseminate
prescription
drug
price
information
and
thus
that
the
appellees,
as
recipients
of
the
information,
have
standing
to
bring
the
suit.
we
further
hold
that
so-called
commercial
speech
is
not
wholly
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
individual
consumer
and
society,
in
general,
may
have
strong
interests
in
the
free
flow
of
commercial
information.
the
ban
on
advertising
prescription
drug
prices
cannot
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
state’s
interest
in
maintaining
the
professionalism
of
its
licensed
pharmacists.
the
state
is
free
to
require
of
course
whatever
professional
standard
it
wishes
of
its
pharmacists,
but
it
may
not
do
so
by
keeping
the
public
in
ignorance
of
the
lawful
terms
that
competing
pharmacists
are
offering.
the
court,
of
course,
has
recognized
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
on
commercial
speech,
but
whatever
these
maybe,
they
are
plainly
exceeded
by
this
virginia
statute
which
singles
out
speech
of
a
particular
content
and
seeks
to
prevent
its
dissemination
completely.
we
point
out
that
there
is
no
claim
made
here
that
the
prohibited
prescription
drug
advertisements
are
false
or
are
misleading
or
that
they
propose
illegal
transactions.
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
concededly
truthful
information
about
entirely
lawful
activity
and
the
state’s
fear
of
the
effect
of
that
information
upon
its
disseminators
and
its
recipients.
we
also
stress
that
this
case
concerns
only
the
regulation
of
commercial
advertising
by
pharmacists.
although
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
other
professions,
the
distinction
between
professions
may
require
consideration
of
quite
different
factors.
physicians
and
lawyers,
for
example,
do
not
dispense
standardized
products
as
we
are
concerned
with
in
the
present
case.
they
render
professional
services.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
each
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion
and
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
