mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
first
amendment
case.
there
is
only
one
question
and
that’s
the
constitutionality
of
the
virginia
statute
which
prohibits
the
advertising
of
the
price
of
prescription
drugs.
the
pharmacy
board
below
on
its
brief
in
this
court,
relied
on
valentine
against
christianson
for
the
proposition
that
commercial
advertising
is
entitled
to
no
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
now
whatever
the
merits
of
that
position
may
have
been
before
june
16
of
last
year
when
this
court
decided
bigelow
that
position
simply
has
no
merit
today.
bigelow
clearly
and
unmistakably
forecloses
any
broad
argument
based
on
valentine
that
all
commercial
advertising
is
outside
the
first
amendment.
bigelow
says
you’ve
got
to
look
at
the
information
being
conveyed.
you’ve
got
to
balance
the
interest
in
having
that
information
conveyed
against
the
interest
of
the
state
in
prohibiting
the
dissemination.
the
traditional
kind
of
first
amendment
balancing.
bigelow
said
you
have
to
find
a
clear
relationship
between
the
prohibitions
and
the
goals
of
the
state.
now
bigelow
did
not
specifically
decide
whether
under
the
line
of
cases,
it
did
rely
upon
the
cases
such
as
the
new
york
times,
against
sullivan
and
pittsburg
press
which
were
precursors
and
we
say
whatever
valentine
once
stood
for.
it
now
only
relates
in
the
manner
in
which
the
distribution
maybe
controlled
by
the
state.
counsel
for
the
pharmacy
board
today
said
“well
bigelow
is
not
a
commercial
advertising
case.”
let
me
read
you
from
the
brief
from
the
state
of
virginia
put
in
the
bigelow
case
last
year.
counsel
for
the
state
of
virginia
was
the
same
counsel
exactly
as
on
the
brief
today.
and
let
me
read
you
from
page
seven
referring
to
the
advertisement
in
bigelow.
appellant's
conduct
is
clearly
within
the
hardcore
of
commercial
activity
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
page
nine,
the
advertisement
therefore
can
only
be
viewed
as
a
proposal
for
the
sale
of
services.
page
11,
quite
simply,
if
the
advertisement
does
no
more
than
propose
a
commercial
transaction.
that’s
exactly
what
they
contended
here
today.
that’s
what
they
contended
last
year
and
that’s
what
we
suggest
today
as
what
went
on
bigelow.
there
was
essentially
a
commercial
transaction,
true
it
was
for
the
sale
of
services
for
abortions
as
opposed
to
the
sale
of
pills
but
essentially
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment
kind
of
analysis.
that
is
the
first
amendment
has
no
applicability
to
commercial
transaction,
the
proposition
is
the
same.
now,
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
traditional
first
amendment
analysis
requires
that
the
state
is
unable
to
prevail
unless
it
can
show
both
a
compelling
state
interest
and
that
it
has
accomplished
that
interest
by
the
least
restrictive
alternative
possible.
that
particular
mode
of
analysis
was
not
specifically
adopted
in
bigelow
nor
was
it
rejected.
the
court
simply
said,
a
clear
relationship
has
to
be
shown.
now,
we
believe
that
as
in
bigelow,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
decide
whether
all
first
amendment
analysis
carry
forth
with
those
compelling
state
interest
and
the
least
restrictive
alternative.
you
don’t
have
to
decide
that
question
here
today
because
whichever
way,
you
strike
the
balance,
the
scale
tips
so
heavily
in
favor
of
public
disclosure
of
this
information
under
the
first
amendment.
that
under
even
the
most
relaxed
rationale
relationship
test,
the
plaintiffs
will
prevail.
i’d
like
to
turn
for
just
a
moment
before
weighting--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
injunction.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes
and
that
we
sought
the
convening
and
retained
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court
and
hence
the
direct
appeal
on
this
court
because
of
the
injunction
that
was
granted
below.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
let
me
say
a
word
about
the--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well
none
of
the
plaintiffs
is
a
newspaper.
although,
of
course
the
effect
of
this
law,
although
none
of
the
plaintiffs
is
a
newspaper
is
to
prohibit
newspapers,
indeed
newspapers
in
the
district
of
columbia
did
sell
in
maryland
and
in
virginia
from
the
disseminating
information
about
prescription
drugs
in
virginia.
so
while
none
of
the
plaintiffs
is
a
newspaper,
it
plainly
has
an
effect
on
newspapers
and
so
it's
only
an
indirect
effect
because
of
course
no
pharmacist
would
place
an
add
on
the
newspaper
knowing
that
he
would
be
subject
to
disciplinary
proceedings
for
having
done
so.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
don’t
believe
so
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well
it's
not
a
--
the
way
the
law
works
is
it
prohibits
pharmacist
from
doing
certain
things
and
it's
not
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
don’t
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i'm
pretty
certain
that’s
correct,
is
that
correct?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
disciplinary
proceedings,
the
equivalent
of
disbarment,
i
don’t
know
what's
called
in
the
pharmacy
profession
but--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
so
your
white
coat
is
removed
or
whatever
may
happen.
i’d
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
these
fourteenth
amendment
cases
and
what
we
have
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well
it's
not
clear
after
the
north
dakota
pharmacy
that
i
can
even
make
a
substantive
due
process
argument
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
indeed,
we
had
such
account
in
our
compliant.
we
were
about
to
go
to
argument
on
this
before
the
three-judge
court,
a
week
or
two
before
this
court
decided
north
dakota
pharmacy.
seeing
that
that
was
not
our
best
point
at
that
time,
we
withdrew
that
claim
from
the
district
court
and
believed
that
we
had
a
strong
first
amendment
claim
and
that
we
chose
to
base
our
contention
on
that.
i
don’t
think
north
dakota
pharmacy
can
be
read
so
broadly
as
to
prohibit
any
substantive
due
process
challenge
but
we
didn’t
consider
that
it
was
appropriate
for
us
to
go
under
here
when
we
made
that
decision.
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
cases
that’s
williamson,
semler
and
head,
there's
two
important
points
to
note
about
that.
first
that
those
cases
analyzed
the
question
only
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
points
of
view.
footnote
ten
on
the
bigelow
case
last
year
page
15
of
the
slip
opinion
specifically
notes
the
fact
that
head
in
particular
did
not
consider
the
first
amendment
challenge
because
it
had
not
been
properly
been
brought
before
this
court.
second,
the
same
thing
is
true
when
it
was
emphasized
in
the
pittsburg
press
case,
again
footnote
ten
at
page
387
of
413
u.s.
so
this
court
has
recognized
on
two
separate
occasions
that
those
cases
do
not
involve
first
amendment
but
aside
from
the
fact
that
they
don’t
involve
the
first
amendment,
i
think
the
most
important
thing
to
note
about
reading
those
cases
is
that
there's
not
one
word
of
mention
any
place
in
there,
about
the
interest
that
the
consumers
have
in
finding
out
this
information.
now
i’ll
talk
about
that
interest
in
a
minute
but
regardless
of
whatever
the
extent
of
the
interest
is,
the
fact
that
consumers
have
the
interest
in
finding
out
how
much
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
for
drugs
that
may
save
their
lives
in
this
case,
is
a
kind
of
question
that
was
never
even
considered.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes
it
is
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
the
right
to
receive
information
under
the
first
amendment
and
the
concomitant
right
on
the
part
of
the
pharmacist
to
speak
freely
and
while
the
pharmacist
is
subject
to
regulation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
are
still
specific
first
amendment
prohibitions
that
cannot
be
overruled.
for
instance,
this
court
in
naacp
against
button
absolutely
cleared
that
lawyers
are
subject
to
regulation
as
a
profession
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
when
the
lawyers
tried
to
cloak
all
of
their
actions
in
we’re
a
profession,
we’re
subject
to
regulation,
this
court
said
no,
you
can't
ride
rough
shot
over
the
first
amendment
associational
rights,
specifically
guaranteed
under
the
general
guise
of
regulation.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
want
to
answer
that
question
directly
because
it's
something
that’s
been
alluded
to
a
number
of
times.
the
first
point,
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
mode
of
analysis
employed
in
bigelow
that
we
are
seeking
to
have
employed
here,
requiring
the
recognition
of
a
first
amendment
right
and
requiring
the
balancing
of
the
two
kind
of
interest,
that
is
the
interest
on
the
one
hand
in
obtaining
the
information,
the
specific
items
of
information
that
we’re
talking
about
as
against
the
interest
that
the
state
has
in
precluding
the
dissemination
of
that
information,
that
kind
of
balancing
test
would
most
definitely
have
to
be
engaged
in,
in
a
case
similar
to
the
one
that
you’ve
suggested.
now,
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
and
this
is
again
very
important.
we
cannot
predict
the
outcome
of
that
case
now
because
we
don’t
know
first,
what
kind
of
information
we
are
talking
about.
i
can
see
wide
distinctions
for
instance
between
information
about
what
a
lawyer
charges
on
a
specific
per
hour
basis
on
the
one
hand
and
a
lawyer
who
attempted
to
make
the
same
kind
of
guarantees
that
the
dentist
did
in
semler
case
saying
“i
guarantee
no
pain”,
whatever
the
legal
equivalent
of
that
maybe
and
“i
guarantee
satisfaction”.
those
are
different
kinds
of
questions
and
they
would
have
to
be
looked
at
differently
on
one
side
of
the
scale.
similarly,
we
don’t
know
and
we
don’t
have
a
record
as
we
have
here
on
what
specific
justifications
the
bar
would
put
forth.
here
we
have
the
monitoring
justification.
we
can
sit
down,
we
can
analyze
it,
and
we
can
say
does
that
make
any
sense?
does
it
come
close
to
promoting
a
goal
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
and
does
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
think
that
those
cases
do
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
professionals
do
not
engage
in
broadly
called
over
reaching
activities
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
the
context
of
analyzing
what
professionals,
who
after
all
are
licensed
by
the
state,
given
an
imprimatur
of
going
out
to
the
public
and
say
“you’re
a
professional,
state
says
that
you
can
do
a
good
job”
the
state
may
well
and
i
don’t
suggest
that
there
is
definite
answer
but
may
well
be
able
to
say
“hold
on,
you
can't
say
the
same
thing
to
soap
maker.”
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
both
of
those
interests
can
properly
be
focused.
we
can
focus
on
the
entire
transaction
and
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
the
state
could
not
focus
on
it.
indeed
i
think
there
are
very
many
important
consumer
interests
that
can
be
protected
against
by
deceptive
and
fraudulent
advertising.
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
the
context
of
a
particular
case
with
regard
to
the
regulations
of
a
particular
profession,
we
have
to
look
at
the
particular
information
under
the
kind
of
analysis
we’re
suggesting
here
and
look
at
the
states
rationale
for
prohibiting
the
dissemination
of
it
judged
against
the
interest
of
both
parties.
the
disseminator
of
the
information
and
the
person
who’s
going
to
receive
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
this
case?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well
the
only
ones
that
had
been
suggested
is
the
fact
that
pharmacy
is
a
profession
and
i
think
that
naacp
against
button
case
eliminates
that
as
a
blanket
excuse
for
all
kinds
of
first
amendment
restrictions.
the
second
is
the
monitoring
argument,
that’s
the
only
other
one
that's
been
put
forward
here.
i
would
suggest
arguments
that
have
been
raised
in
other
cases
and
i
deal
with
them
quickly
if
i
may.
first
it's
been
suggested--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well
i
don’t
think
it
fits
in
at
all,
but
the
state
has
said--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
that’s
not
the
monitoring
argument.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
let
me
give
you
the
monitoring
argument,
as
i
understand
the
state's
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
okay
fine.
the
monitoring
is
a
practice
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i'm
stating
their
case.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
it.
[laughter]
i
can
assure
you
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
interest
in
monitoring.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that’s
right
and
that’s
what
i'm
going
to
do
right
now.
the
state
claims
that
monitoring
which
is
the
keeping
of
records
of
what
prescription
drugs
are
taken
by
each
patient
will
encourage
--
will
permit
a
pharmacist
to
be
able
to
look
at
a
record,
profile
and
tell
whether
a
patient
is
taking
a
drug
that
maybe
antagonistic
to
the
one
on
which
he
is
about
to
fill
a
prescription
on.
now
they
claim
that
what
the
statute
does
is,
it
does
not
tell
consumers
what
prices
are
being
charged
at
different
drugstores
around
town
or
around
the
county.
and
therefore
consumers
presumably
won’t
know
enough
to
shop
around
and
get
a
better
buy
and
therefore
they’ll
just
out
of
habit
go
back
to
the
same
drugstore
that
they’ve
always
have
been
going
to.
that’s
what
i
understand
the
argument
is;
now,
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
is
about
three
fold.
the
first
is
that
there's
not
the
slightest
evidence
anyplace
and
this
is
anything
but
an
invention
and
that
the
legislature
had
the
foggiest
notion
that
they
were
creating
a
monitoring
system.
the
statute
we
have
in
front
of
us
is
the
product
of
a
regulation
which
was
issued
in
1967
by
the
state
pharmacy
board.
that
regulation
said
no
advertising
of
the
price
of
prescription
drugs.
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
said
“uh-uh,
you
don’t
have
authority
to
issue
that
regulation”,
so
1968
statute
was
passed.
not
a
word
about
monitoring,
they
didn’t
pass
a
monitoring
statute.
they
passed
a
no
price
advertising
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
not
a
word.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well
i'm
suggesting
there's
no
evidence
of
it
and
there's
subsequent
evidence
of
conduct
which
supports
that
inference,
and
that
is
first
that
the
pharmacy
board
has
never
urged
upon
the
state
to
pass
a
regulation,
a
statute.
they
have
never
attempted
to
pass
a
regulation
that
would
require
monitoring.
the
state
pharmacist's
own
code
of
ethics
which
does
not
require
any
state
authority
at
all--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that’s
right,
if
that
was
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
we
wouldn’t
be
out
for
the
next
reason
i'm
going
to
get
to
and
that
is
that
the
statute
goes
much
too
far.
it's
vastly
over
inclusive,
it
does
much
more
than
needed
to
accomplish
this
end.
after
all,
we
have
a
doctor
who
is
involved
in
this
transaction,
we
are
dealing
only
with
drugs
which
a
doctor
has
told
the
patient
“you
better
this
take
this
drug
because
this
may
save
your
life,
or
may
cure
an
illness
that
you
have.”
so
we
are
not
dealing
with
something
that’s
optional
even,
we
are
dealing
with
prescription
drugs
and
the
doctor
has
a
professional
obligation
to
be
sure
that
antagonistic
drugs
aren’t
taken.
now
of
course,
no
doctor
is
perfect
as
no
lawyer
and
no
pharmacist
is
perfect
and
there
maybe
times
when
they
will
miss.
the
book
will
not
be
accurate
or
they
will
not
take
the
time
to
check.
that
simply
means
that
we've
got
malpractice.
on
the
other
hand,
it
does
suggest
to
me
that
the
pharmacist
can
provide
a
useful
function
but
only
as
a
back
up
function.
the
primary
responsibility
is
on
the
doctor
and
that’s
where
it
ought
to
continue
to
be
placed
and
if
the
state
elected
a
number
of
less
restrictive
ways
of
accomplishing
this
monitoring,
short
of
a
price
control
regulation
which
is
what
they
almost
have
here.
then,
we
would
have
a
different
case
but
we
don’t.
they’ve
done
with
this
no
advertising
statute
that
which
they
ought
to
have
done
if
it’s
worth
doing
at
all
with
the
monitoring
statute.
the
second
reason
is
that
the
monitoring
--
that
the
statute
is
vastly
ineffective
for
achieving
even
the
limited
ends
that
it’s
supposed
to
achieve.
and
it’s
ineffective
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
only
a
small
minority
of
pharmacists
actually
monitor
these
days.
the
second,
consumers
shop
around.
in
any
event,
they
don’t
always
go
to
the
same
store
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
maybe
closer
to
one
doctor,
maybe
closer
to
their
home,
their
office,
there
maybe
non
prescription
drug
sales
at
one
place
and
they
decided,
well,
as
long
as
i’m
in
here
i
might
as
well
fill
my
prescription.
indeed
the
way
the
advertising
rules
work,
the
pharmacist
can
advertise
non-prescription
drugs,
non-drug
items,
they
can
even
advertise
that
they’ll
give
you
free
cup
of
coffee
while
you
wait
and
they
can
advertise
free
delivery.
but
the
one
thing
that
the
consumer
really
wants
to
know
is
what's
it
going
to
cost,
where
in
this
range
of
100%
to
600%
variation,
are
you
mr.
pharmacist
going
to
fall?
that
information
you
can’t
get
under
this
statute.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
certainly
think
it
could
be
interpreted
that
way.
and
i
would
say
that
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
earlier
about
whether
consumer
could
go
in
and
circulate,
obtain
the
factual
information
from
the
pharmacist
by
asking
them
and
go
out
and
put
a
consumer’s
bullet
in
their
guide
up,
i
would
say
that
there
are
situations
in
which
not
the
pharmacist
but
other
laws
similar
to
this.
those
laws
had
been
construed
to
say
a
doctor
who
cooperates
or
a
lawyer
who
cooperates
in
that
situation
simply
giving
out
factual
information
is
engaged
in
unethical
conduct
the
way
a
pharmacist
would
be
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
absolutely
nothing,
in
the
statute
it
says--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
circulating
that
fact
among
its
members,
well,
i
don’t
know
whether
the
pharmacist
--
the
pharmacist
who
cooperate
in
that
venture,
if
he
knew
that
the
information
was
going
to
be
circulated
might
be
guilty
under
this
rather
broad
statute.
it
hasn’t
been
pressed
that
far
although
as
i
suggested
other
similar
statutes
have
been
pressed
at
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that’s
right,
because
that
only
goes
to
the
mechanism
for
enforcing
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
and
i
would
suggest
that
--
similar
to
the
other
statutes
that
i
mentioned
earlier
also
involved
only
doctors
in
one
case
i’m
thinking
of
particularly.
only
a
doctor
could
be
disciplined
but
that
if
the
doctor
knowingly
cooperates
being
aware
that
the
result
is
going
to
be
this
kind
of
information
dissemination,
he
would
be
guilty
of
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
misspoke
and
i
wanted
to
correct
that
and
i
was
in
the
middle
of--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
thank
you
very
much
sir.
what
i
wanted
to
say
is,
indeed,
it’s
just
the
opposite
because
as
was
earlier
pointed
out
the
state
doesn’t
even
have
a
policy
prohibiting
price
competition.
if
indeed,
it
had
a
policy
prohibiting
price
competition.
if
for
instance,
all
pharmacists
had
to
charge
prices
in
accordance
with
what
the
state
pharmacy
board
determined
after
appropriate
hearing
was
a
reasonable
price.
in
a
way,
utility
has
to
charge
for
instance,
the
telephone
company
or
electric
company.
and
in
that
situation,
somebody
was
advertising
a
price
below
the
price.
we
have
a
case
like
pittsburg
press,
aiding
and
abetting
in
illegal
activity.
but
here
we
are
not
aiding
and
abetting
anything
that’s
illegal.
it’s
perfectly
legal
for
a
pharmacist
to
charge
any
price
the
pharmacist
chooses.
indeed,
it’s
perfectly
legal
and
the
state
has
no
policy
against
consumers
shopping
around.
all
it
has
a
policy
against
as
far
as
we
can
determine,
is
consumers
shopping
around
in
a
meaningful
way
by
newspaper
advertisement
and
other
forms
of
media
advertising
so
they
can
find
out
what
the
prices
are
reasonably
instead
of
having
to
walk
around
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that’s
the
policy,
yes.
that's
what
the
statute
says
and
they
claim,
it’s
to
enforce
the
policy
having
to
do
with
monitoring.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
is.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
first
say
that
my
first
offhand
reaction
is
that
that
would
not
be
a
first
amendment
issue.
my
second
reaction
is
that,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
excuse
me,
because
i
would
think
that
the
state
would
have
a
legitimate
interest
if
it
made
a
factual
determination
that
builds
a
pharmacologically
identical
to
be
able
to
say
to
the
doctor,
you
must
prescribe
that
unless
there
is
some
medical
reason
for
doing
so.
but
i
don’t
think
whatever
the
outcome
of
that
case
maybe,
would
control
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
don’t
see
the
speech
element
of
first
amendment
coming
in.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
say
that
would
very
much
come
on
to
the
o’brien,
united
states
against
o’brien
where
it’s
a
mixed
act
of
speech
and
conduct
and
is
much
more
having
to
do
with
the
conduct
and
the
content.
i
think
almost
anything
that
any
of
us
does
could
be
a
speech--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
it
might
be
--
as
i
say
i
haven’t
focused
on
it
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it’s
not
traditional
kind
of
expression
issue.
it
maybe
–
he
may
have
a
fifth
or
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
engage
in
his
occupation,
in
accordance
with
what
he
determines
to
be
the
best
dictates
of
his
profession
and
training.
and
i
would
certainly
want
to
think
about
it
and
want
to
see
what
the
justifications
were.
my
own
belief
is
such
statute
would
be
constitutional
because
of
the
state's
interest
in
ensuring
that
people
who
are
in
need
of
medical
assistance
are
permitted
to
--
are
able
to
buy
at
the
least
possible
price
where
there
is
no
medical
difference.
now,
if
there
were
medical
differences
of
course
we’d
be
in
a
different
kind
of
an
inquiry.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
oh
yes,
since
we
won
this
case,
almost
a
year
a
half
ago
there
has
been
advertising
going
on.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
there’s
been
no
stay
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i’m
sorry,
your
honor.
why
aren’t
they
plaintiffs?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
the
pharmacists
had
a
try
at
this,
in
1969
in
patterson
against
kingery,
they
didn't
win
that
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
these
are
consumers,
we
thought,
that
we
could
do
a
little
better
[laughter].
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
my
first
reaction
would
be
that
that's
certainly
an
item
of
information
that
consumers
would
want
to
know.
and
that
the
lawyer
would
want
to
be
able
to
disseminate
that
either
because
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
the
people
he
is
attracting
can
pay
the
fees
or
because
he
thinks
that
he
would
get
people
to
come
in
at
that
rate
because
he
thinks
it’s
a
good
competitive
rate.
now,
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
talking
about
a
dignified
notice
or
simply
a
statement
in
some
place
in
a
legal
registry
of
some
kind
that
says
$25.00
an
hour
is
what
this
lawyer
charges.
i
would
see
no
interest
of
state
of
the
kind
that
i
would
think
would
be
sufficient
to
overturn
it.
but
as
i
said
before,
i
think
that
before
we
prejudge
a
case
like
that
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
have
an
opportunity
to
present
whatever
justification,
the
equivalent
of
monitoring
or
whatever
else
the
state
has
to
put
forth
and
we
can
make
a
determination
at
that
time.
my
own
judgment
would
be
since
i
think
that’s
what
you’ve
asked
that
there
is
no
sufficient
interest
of
the
state
involved.
but
again,
i
would
say
that
i
would
want
finally
to
wait
until
we
saw
exactly
what
the
facts
were
before
we
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
in
every
case
of
course,
there
would
be
a
strong
presumption
that
the
right
to
know
would
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
but
it’s
always
engaged
in
the
permissible
balancing
test
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
cases
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no
and--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
that’s
right.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
absolutist
view
of
first
amendment
commands
a
majority
of
the
justices
of
this
court
at
this
time
and
i
have
said
that
of
course
under
an
absolutist
view,
we
would
be
entitled
to
win.
but
even
without
that,
even
under
the
traditional
view
that
if
the
state
could
show--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
compelling
state
interest
and
it
was
a
least
restrictive
way
they
could
prevent
this
dissemination,
then
that
case
might
be
cited
against
the
dissemination
of
the
information
but
we
have
to
look
at
the
facts.
the
analysis
would
be
the
same.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that’s
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
it’s
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it’s
the
correlative
--
i
would
say
of
the
right
to
speak.
freedom
of
speech
that
i
think
justice
brennan
said
that
the
market
place
would
be
a
barren
place
indeed,
if
we
had
only
sellers
and
no
buyers.
and
we’ve
recognized
the
right
to
receive
information
specifically
in
a
number
of
context
lamonte--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
you
were
concurring
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
we
would
certainly
say
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
direct
right
to
speak
that
would
plainly
support
the
right
to
receive
the
information.
but
there
have
been
a
couple
of
cases
in
which
the
question
about
the
right
to
speak
has
not
been
at
issue.
kleindienst
against
mandel
for
instance,
no
one
claimed
that
professor
mandel
had
a
constitutional
right
under
our
constitution,
as
someone
from
belgium
to
speak
nor
did
anyone
say
that
the
hanoi
government
and
lamont
had
a
right
to
speak.
yet
we
upheld
the
constitutional
rights
in
those
cases.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
the
pharmacist
do
have
the
right
to
speak
in
this
case.
but
they
are
not
here
and
i
do
say
that
there
have
been
cases
in
this
court
and
i
simply
make
the
observation.
i
think
that
the
rights
are
equal
and
the
same
and
that
when
you
view
the
entire
transaction
together,
considering
all
of
the
rights
involved
that
you
do
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
this
information
disseminated
and
received
in
this
case.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
have
been
a
couple
of
cases
where
the
right
to
receive
has
seemingly
been
elevated
above
the
right
of
the
person
who
is
making
the
statement
had
under
our
constitution.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
agree
with
you
a
hundred
percent
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
don’t
think
and
i
haven’t
read
my
brief
again
with
that
specific
in
mind
that
we
specifically
adapted
the
right
to
know
phraseology
in
this
court,
largely
relying
upon
your
honors
opinion
in
bigelow
where
that
phrase
was
not
involved.
and
i
agree
that
the
free
flow
of
information
is
what
the
first
amendment
is
really
all
about.
and
we’re
suggesting
here
that
the
consumers
have
a
very
important
part
to
be
heard
in
explaining
why
this
information
should
be
disseminated.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
don’t.
you
mean
something
meaningful
to
say?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
i’m
only
talking
about--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that
is
absolutely
correct.
i’m
only
talking
about
those
cases
in
which
a
state
is
claiming
that
some
interest
in
prohibiting
certain
kinds
of
information
maybe
raised
and
in
those
cases,
i
think
that
it’s
proper
as
this
court
did
in
bigelow
last
year
to
take
a
look
at
the
kind
of
information
that
we’re
talking
about.
that
was
my
only
point.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
thank
you
very
much.
