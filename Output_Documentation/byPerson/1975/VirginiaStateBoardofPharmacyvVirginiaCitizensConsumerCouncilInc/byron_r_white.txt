justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
head
a
due
process
case
and
not
a
first
amendment
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
disagree
with
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
then
this
is
a
due
process
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
state’s
interest
in
forbidding
the
advertising
to
forbid
to
do
away
with
competition
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
how
does
it
protect
health?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
advertise
and
if
you
advertise
prices
so
called
price
studying,
you
think
it
might
lead
everyone
to
cut
prices
which
lowers
profits
which
would
put
the
druggist
in
a
poor
position
to
do
his
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now,
has
that
advertising
impinge
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
general
assembly
in
its
wisdom
doesn’t
fix
prices
on
drugs,
and
it
doesn’t
prevent
a
druggist
from
cutting
a
price
at
the
request
of
the
consumer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn’t
prevent—it
wouldn’t
prevent
i
suppose
consumers
picketing
a
drug
store
to
say
that
druggist
is
charging
too
high
a
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wouldn’t
even
prevent
one
druggist
from
picketing
another,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
druggist
wants
to
sell
the
drugs
cheaper
than
his
competitors
who
made
do
so
without
interference.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
law
prevent
me
from
writing
a
letter
to
my
friends
in
the
lodge,
if
i
belong
to
one
that
there’s
an
awful
good
price
on
certain
drugs
at
a
certain
drug
store?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
everybody
but
the
druggist
can
advertise
the
fact
that
there
is
a
cut
rate
druggist
down
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
ask
him
what
his
price
is
he
can
certainly
tell
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
can
go
outside
and
tell
everybody
else
you
wanted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
we
--
must
we
take
in
to
account
of
the
first
amendment
interest
here
of
the
druggist
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
first
amendment
interest
of
the
druggist
to
take
account
of
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
there
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
involved
not
the
criminal
conviction
of
the
publisher
of
the
newspaper?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
what
about
the
monitoring,
how
do
you
tie
that
in,
i
mean
why
does
that
fit
in
as
a
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
they
make
that
benefit
that
if
unless
the
pharmacy
makes
an
adequate
profit,
they
won’t
deal
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
activity,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
the
one
who
says
that
your
interest
outweigh
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
can
you
please
tell
me
how
it
outweighs
the
state's,
when
you’re
telling
the
state
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there’s
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
labor
union
for
example
couldn’t
go
to
a
pharmacist
or
to
a
chain
drug
store
and
negotiate
for
lower
prescription
rates
for
its
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nothing
to
forbid
the
labor
union
from
circulating
that
among
its
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
doctor
is
to
prescribe
a
certain
proprietary
drug,
if
he
thinks
his
better
or
he
just
wants
his
customers
to
use
that
drug?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
isn’t
that
this
is
a
first
amendment
issue?
