mr.
robert
b.
reich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims.
after
the
government’s
petition
was
filed
in
this
case
by
leave
of
these
courts,
the
claimant’s
widow
was
substituted
as
respondent
before
this
court
and
for
simplicity
sake
when
i
refer
to
the
respondent
i
shall
be
referring
to
the
claimant.
respondent
was
discharged
from
his
position
of
civilian
employment
with
the
army
and
air
force
exchange
service
for
alleged
acts
of
misconduct
incompatible
with
his
continued
employment.
that
discharge
was
sustained
on
administrative
appeal.
respondent
then
commenced
this
suit
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims,
alleging
that
the
discharge
and
the
subsequent
administrative
appeal
violated
applicable
exchange
service
regulations
than
in
effect.
that
was
also
a
breach
of
his
contract
of
employment
with
the
exchange
service
and
that
he
was
also
thereby
denied
due
process.
he
sought
back
pay
and
allowances
and
he
asserted
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act.
the
court
of
claims
denied
the
government’s
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
acknowledged
that
prior
to
1970,
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
such
claims,
but
the
court
held
that
the
1970
amendment
to
the
tucker
act
which
provides
that
a
contract
expressed
or
implied
with
the
exchange
service
shall
be
deemed
a
contract
with
the
united
states
conferred
such
jurisdiction
and
the
court
reasoned
that
exchange
service
employees
have
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
exchange
service.
now,
we
submit
that
the
court
of
claims
was
correct
only
insofar
as
it
acknowledged
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
respondent’s
non-contractual
claims.
congress
does
not
appropriate
money
to
support
the
exchange
service
and
there
is
no
statute
or
constitutional
provision
that
can
fairly
be
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation
for
the
damage
sustained.
that
is
a
prerequisite
to
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act
for
non-contractual
claims
as
this
court
recently
acknowledged
and
held
in
united
states
against
testan
and
zirilli
(ph).
but
we
submit
that
the
court
of
claims
misconstrued
the
1970
amendment
to
the
tucker
act
to
encompass
within
its
provisions
a
claim
by
an
exchange
service
employee
to
back
pay
for
unlawful
discharge.
first,
such
claims
are
not
derived
form
contract.
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
in
the
exchange
service
is
derived
entirely
from
regulations,
duly
promulgated
under
the
authority
of
the
secretaries
of
the
army
and
air
force.
indeed
the
very
terms
and
conditions
that
respondent
alleged
were
violated
in
this
case
were
derived
solely
from
those
regulations.
now,
respondent
asserts
in
his
brief
before
this
court
that
those
regulations
in
effect
constitute
a
contract
of
employment.
but
those
regulations
can
be
and
have
been
unilaterally
changed
by
the
exchange
service,
by
the
secretaries
of
the
army
and
air
force
as
the
needs
of
the
army
and
air
force
require.
indeed,
they
were
changed
and
modified
during
the
course
of
respondent’s
employment
and
they
continue
to
be
subject
to
periodic
change
and
modification
and
a
long
line
of
cases
beginning
with
butler
against
pennsylvania,
this
court
has
held
that
government
employment
that
is
based
upon
regulations
or
statutes
which
unilaterally
must
be
capable
of
change
as
public
needs
require,
does
not
giver
rise
to
contractual
rights.
accordingly,
the
exchange
service
employees
like
other
federal
employees,
do
not
have
contractual
rights
against
the
united
states.
this
conclusion
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
we
submit
that
the
term
government
or
federal
employees
has
no
real
talismanic
significance
in
this
case.
exchange
service
employees
certainly
are
federal
employees
for
many
purposes.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
congress
has
expressly
included
them
within
the
definition
of
federal
employee
for
the
purposes
of
the
dual
compensation
act
and
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
they
are
federal
employees
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
many
of
the
rules
and
regulations
are
exactly
the
same
as
those
governing
other
federal
employees.
the
point
is
and
i
think
this
is
the
point
that
the
court
of
claims
misconstrued
that
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
because
they
are
derived
entirely
from
regulations,
duly
authorized
and
promulgated
under
the
authority
of
the
secretaries
of
the
army
and
air
force
and
because
they
can
be
and
must
be
capable
of
unilateral
change,
indeed
they
were
capable
and
there
were
changed
in
this
case,
simply
do
not
give
rise
to
contractual
rights,
whether
you
term
this
people
federal
employees
or
something
else.
in
terms
of
the
relationship
of
their
employment
it
is
not
contractual.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
certainly.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
we
would
submit
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
we
would
submit
your
honor
that
if
employment
is
governed
by
terms
and
conditions
which
unilaterally
must
be
subject
to
change
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
those
terms
and
conditions
could
not
be
changed
then
there
is
no
contractual
relationship.
now,
i
am
informed
that
there
is
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
at
this
particular
time
with
regard
to
enlistees
who
actually
sign
a
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
your
honor,
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
precise
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
traditional
hallmark
of
a
contractual
relationship
is
an
agreement
to
be
bound
by
whatever
term
and
conditions
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
a
contract
presumably
could
be
your
honor,
but
if
one
party
to
a
contract
and
this
is
established
in
contract
law,
if
one
party
to
the
contract
may
unilaterally
change
whatever
terms
and
conditions
that
are
part
of
that
agreement,
then
it
is
not
deemed
a
contract
or
an
implied
contract.
even
an
implied
contract
would
not
stand
up
under
scrutiny
if
one
of
the
parties
could
laterally
at
anytime
change
the
terms
of
conditions.
it
is
not
merely
enough
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
we
would
not
your
honor
call
that
a
contract
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
this
would
be
precisely
the
same
type
of
employment-
relationship
that
all
federal
employees
as
this
court
has
time
again
held
to
which
they
are
subject
and
that
is
the
rights
and
obligations
of
employment
derived
entirely
from
rules
and
regulations
and
statutes.
it
is
not
contractual
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
agreement
presumably
would
be
an
element
of
the
relationship,
but
that
we
submit
would
not
be
enough
to
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
it
is
not
a
contract
because
as
this
court
has
held,
well,
for
instance,
butler
against
pennsylvania
was
one
of
the
first
times
that
this
court
actually
faced
the
issue
of
a
government
employee
asserting
that
he
had
contractual
rights
to
whatever
agreement
he
had
entered
into
with
the
government
and
at
that
time
this
court
said
contractual
rights
are
to
be
distinguished
from
engagements
adapted
by
the
government
for
the
benefit
of
all
which
are
to
be
varied
or
discontinued
as
the
public
good
shall
require
and
then
this
court
went
on
to
say,
the
establishment
of
contract
would
arrest
necessarily
everything
like
progress
or
improvement
in
the
government.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
label
it
is
convenient
to
put
upon
this
government
employment
relationships,
but
this
court
has
held
and
we
think
wisely
that
the
appellation
contracts
simply
is
inappropriate.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendment
to
the
tucker
act
confirms
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
affect
the
substantive
rights
of
exchange
service
employees.
exchange
service
employees
are
nowhere
specifically
mentioned
in
any
of
the
legislative
history,
any
of
the
reports
or
debates
or
hearings,
proceeding
enactment.
the
entire
focus
of
congressional
concern
in
1970
was
upon
independent
third
party
contractors
and
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
suppliers
of
good
and
services
who
and
there
is
a
repeated
cadence
in
legislative
history,
a
need
to
put
this
third
party
suppliers
upon
equal
footing
with
those
who
contracted
for
goods
and
services
with
the
rest
of
the
federal
government
and
over
whose
contractual
claims
the
court
of
claims
did
have
jurisdiction.
the
absence
of
any
express
reference
to
exchange
service
employees
in
the
legislative
history
is
particularly
indicative
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
are
100,000
exchange
service
employees
and
had
congress
intended
in
1970
to
expose
the
federal
treasury
to
the
indeterminately
large
liabilities
that
might
be
represented
by
the
back
pay
claims
of
this
size
of
a
group,
presumably
congress
would
have
address
the
issue
directly
but
it
did
not
do
so.
indeed,
whenever
prior
to
1970,
congress
had
legislated
with
respect
to
the
rights
or
obligations
of
exchange
service
employees,
it
had
done
so
expressly
and
directly.
for
instance,
it
expressly
included
exchange
service
employees
within
the
definition
of
federal
employees
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago.
it
expressly
excluded
exchange
service
employees
from
the
definition
of
federal
employees
for
the
purposes
of
laws
administered
by
the
civil
service
commission,
including
i
might
add
the
back
pay
act.
now
in
1970,
had
congress
intended
to
give
exchange
service
employees
a
back
pay
remedy,
presumably
not
only
would
it
have
addressed
the
issue
directly
in
the
legislation
of
legislative
history,
but
presumably
it
would
have
done
it
directly
by
merely
amending
the
back
pay
act
to
encompass
such
claims.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
that
is
not
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
there
were
series
of
cases
beginning
i
believe
with
united
states
against
wickersham
under
which
an
employee
whose
emoluments
were
actually
enacted
in
appropriations
by
congress
might
have
an
entitlement
to
back
pay
under
the
theory
that
he
had
never
been
lawfully
discharged
from
his
employment.
but
we
would
point
out
that
in
those
cases
congress
had
waived
sovereign
immunity
at
least
to
the
extent
of
creating
a
substantive
right
to
money.
the
public
treasury
was
exposed
by
the
very
nature
of
the
appropriation,
but
with
regard
to
exchange
service
employees,
where
congress
has
not
appropriated
any
money
to
support
the
exchange
services
that
kind
of
logic
obviously
would
not
be
sufficient
to
create
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
yes,
the
1970
amendment
does
concern
itself
with
third
party
contractors
with
the
exchange
service.
however
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
but
congress
presumably
would
have
said
so
had
it
so
intended
and
our
point
is
that
first
of
all
these
are
not
contractual
relationships
and
secondly,
congress
did
not
indicate
any
intention
at
all
within
the
hearings,
debates,
or
reports
proceeding
enactment
to
bring
within
the
ambit
of
the
term
contract
or
contractual
relationships.
the
claims
of
exchange
service
employees,
congressional
silence
both
in
the
legislative
history
and
also
in
the
language
of
the
resulting
enactment
can
only
be
taken
as
an
indication
that
congress
simply
did
not
intend
to
embrace
or
encompass
exchange
service
employees
claims
to
back
pay
for
unlawful
discharge.
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
particularly
within
the
context
of
court
of
claims,
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
cannot
be
implied,
but
must
be
unequivocally
stated.
there
has
been
no
such
unequivocally
statement
here.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
keetz
case
was
one
of
four
cases
your
honor
that
were
cited
in
the
legislative
history
all
merely
for
the
proposition
or
merely
as
instances
where
sovereign
immunity
had
barred
access
to
the
court
of
claims.
three
of
the
cases,
not
the
keetz
case,
but
the
other
three
cases
involved
express
contracts
for
the
supply
of
goods
or
services.
keetz,
you
correctly
point
out,
did
involve
the
claim
to
back
pay
by
an
exchange
service
employee.
however,
none
of
these
cases
were
cited
on
its
facts
or
discussed
on
its
facts.
they
were
merely
cited
in
the
legislative
history
as
four
instances
where
sovereign
immunity
had
barred
access
to
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
in
the
instant
case
focused
upon
the
keetz
case
in
discerning
a
congressional
intent
to
bring
exchange
service
employees
within
the
ambit
of
the
1970
amendment,
but
we
think
that
the
mere
citation
of
keetz
without
any
discussion
whatsoever
is
not
sufficient
indication
that
congress
unequivocally
intended
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
and
to
expose
the
public
treasury
to
the
claims
of
exchange
service
employees.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
but
again
your
honor
we
–
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
again
we
would
have
to
point
out
that
the
fact
that
they
are
100,000
exchange
service
employees,
the
fact
that
congress
had
expressly
legislated
with
respect
to
them
three
or
four
times
prior
to
1970
and
had
expressly
excluded
them
from
coverage
of
laws
administered
by
the
civil
service
commission,
including
the
back
pay
act
would
indicate
that
congress
simply
did
not
intend
or
focus
upon
or
consider
the
inclusion
of
exchange
service
employees
within
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
represented
by
the
1970
amendment
and
again
one
cornerstone
of
our
argument
must
be
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized,
such
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity,
exposure
of
the
public
treasury
to
claims
within
the
court
of
claims
simply
cannot
be
implied,
but
must
by
unequivocally
stated
somewhere.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
reminder
of
my
time
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
just
two
points,
may
it
please
the
court.
respondent
tells
us
that
the
terms
and
conditions
of
his
employment
in
the
exchange
service
derived
from
contract,
but
when
asked
to
provide
the
basis
for
the
contract
or
to
provide
the
terms
or
the
relations
for
the
contract,
he
turns
inevitably
to
the
regulations
governing
employment
in
the
exchange
service.
i
would
point
out
that
these
regulations
not
only
were
unilaterally
changed
during
the
course
of
respondent’s
employment,
but
the
very
terms
and
conditions,
the
very
regulations
that
respondent
in
his
complaint
before
the
court
of
claims
asserted
were
violated
or
were
breached
were
not
enforced
in
effect
at
the
commencements
of
his
employment
in
1958
with
the
exchange
service.
therefore,
the
employment
status
of
this
employee
like
other
exchange
service
employees
really
turns
within
or
comes
within
the
butler
principle
and
that
principle
does
not
turn
upon
labels
as
to
who
is
or
who
is
not
a
federal
employee,
because
we
know
that
for
certain
purposes,
exchange
service
employees
are
deemed
federal
employees.
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
there
are
statutes
in
which
congress
has
expressly
brought
them
within
that
definition
for
other
purposes,
they
are
outside
that
definite
of
federal
employee.
the
term
federal
employee
is
not
the
touchstone.
the
question
rather
is
whether
under
the
butler
principal,
the
employment
relationship
with
the
government
is
derived
entirely
as
here
from
regulations
or
statutes
which
must
be
capable
of
uniform
or
unilateral
change
as
public
policy
requires.
in
traditional
contract
terminology,
there
would
be
no
contract
simply
because
there
is
no
mutual
obligation
to
be
bound.
in
fact,
even
as
between
private
parties
an
agreement
such
as
this
or
such
as
respondent
wants
to
create
would
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
retroactive
for
that
claim
for
money
due
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
we
would
contend
that
that
would
no
be.
that
would
be
exactly
the
same
mr.
justice
white
as
any
other
employee
of
the
government.
again,
whether
he
is
termed
the
federal
employee
or
not,
who
merely
asserted
that
he
was
entitled
to
back
pay
and
if
there
is
an
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
then
he
is
entitled
to
back
pay
or
if
the
back
pay
act
applies.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
but
if
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
it
would
be
a
contract
claim
if
this
were
between
private
parties.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
if
you
were
to
conclude
that
their
employment
relationship
was
not
of
the
sort
that
would
come
under
butler
whether
it
be
called
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
the
court
of
claims
merely
went
by
labels
mr.
justice,
they
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
they
said
that
they
were
not
“federal
employees,”
but
they
did
not
analyze
and
what
we
emphasize,
they
should
have
done
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
with
analysis
if
you
decided
that
they
were
not
government
employees
then
the
next
question
would
be
whether
in
1970
congress
gave
any
express
indication
that
it
desired
to
expose
the
public
treasury
to
the
claims
of
these
exchange
service
employees
because
what
we
are
trying
to
construe
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
because
there
are
a
hundred
thousand;
there
are
two
reasons
mr.
justice:
first,
there
are
a
hundred
thousand
exchange
service
employees.
whenever
congress
had
legislated
with
respect
to
them
in
the
past
and
had
done
so
directly.
secondly,
because
these
employees
are
federal
employees
for
certain
purposes
and
are
not
for
other
purposes
because
there
is
at
the
very
least
that
confusion
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
no,
but
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
for
the
congress
expressly
included
them
within
the
definition
of
federal
employees
for
the
due
compensation
act,
the
prevailing
wage
rate,
the
federal
employees
compensation
act,
they
are
federal
employees
for
the
purpose
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well
certainly,
i
mean
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
cannot
be
implied
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
he
simply
does
not
have
a
remedy
under
the
tucker
act
for
access
to
the
court
of
claims
since
there
must
be
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
his
remedy,
he
perhaps
might
have
a
remedy
and
again
–-
he
might
have
remedy
under
--
if
his
allegation
is
that
the
government
has
not
subscribed
properly
to
the
regulations,
governing
employment,
he
might
have
a
remedy
under
mandamus
in
the
district
court
or
perhaps
he
would
have
a
remedy
under
1331.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
in
that
case
you
might
have
an
allegation
under
the
tucker
act
not
as
a
contract,
but
any
federal
employee
or
any
person
employed
by
the
government
might
have
a
just
compensation
claim.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
correct
if
we
are
private
parties.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
if
one
party
is
the
government
mr.
justice,
the
remedy
for
every
one
who
has
an
employment
relationship
with
the
government
and
was
not
been
paid
by
the
government,
i
presume
that
the
remedy
would
be
under
the
tucker
act
and
the
allegation
would
be
something
that
can
do
an
unjust
taking,
a
lack
of
just
compensation
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
perhaps
an
illegal
extraction,
but
our
point
is
that
that
would
not
create
a
contract,
right?
if
i,
for
instance,
were
not
paid
by
the
government,
i
might
have
access
to
the
court
of
claims
under
one
of
those
theories.
perhaps
a
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
i
would
also
have
access
under
the
back
pay
act.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
that
is
absolutely
correct;
he
would
not
have
access
under
the
back
pay
act.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
he
would
have
absolutely
no
forum
for
the
back
pay
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
--
that
he
claims
he
was
entitled
to.
he
might
have
a
forum
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
he
might
have
a
forum
for
reinstatement,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
following
butler
there
were
many
cases
concerned
not
with
high
level
appointees,
but
concerned
with
all
kinds
of
individuals
who
had
employment
relationships.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
well,
for
instance,
united
states
against
hartwell
at
73
u.s.
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
i
believe
is
concerned
with
a
minor
official
who
does
not
come
under
the
appointments
clause,
but
where
the
government
simply
relied
upon
the
butler
principle
and
held
that
because
his
employment
relationship
derives
from
regulations
that
must
be
capable
of
change
as
public
policy
requires,
therefore,
he
does
not
have
contractual
rights.
there
is
no
vesting
of
any
right
against
the
government
and
again
the
butler
logic
would
apply
with
equal
force
to
all
employees
--
mr.
robert
b.
reich
it
is
not
contractual.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
not
that
the
contract
is
one
that
is
terminable
at
will
or
that
there
are
any
vested
contract
of
rights
at
all.
the
simple
holding
is
that
there
is
no
contract
to
begin
with.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
b.
reich
your
honor,
that
is
correct
except
insofar
as
you
and
i
are
paid
from
appropriated
funds,
so
that
the
very
least,
even
if
they
were
not
a
tucker
act,
again
referring
to
the
case
i
cited
yesterday
wickersham,
there
is
a
line
of
cases
holding
that
even
prior
to
the
back
pay
act,
if
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
represented
by
a
mere
appropriation,
the
government
has
in
effect
opened
up
the
public
treasury
and
exposed
it
to
that
kind
of
a
back
pay
claim.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
thank
you.
