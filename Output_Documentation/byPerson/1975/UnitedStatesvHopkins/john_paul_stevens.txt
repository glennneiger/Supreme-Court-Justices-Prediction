john
paul

mr.
reich,
can
i
test
that
with
you
for
just
a
moment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
a
person
is
drafted
into
the
service
under
the
selected
service
law
and
he
has
to
serve
according
to
the
rules
and
regulations
in
effect
from
time
to
time.
is
his
legal
relationship
to
his
employer
the
same
as
the
legal
relationship
with
this
employee
to
his
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
terms
could
be
said
unilaterally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
talking
about
the
enlistees.
perhaps,
you
did
not
hear
my
question.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
legal
relationship
of
a
draftee
and
a
person
who
voluntarily
says
to
the
government
i
will
work
on
these
terms
and
conditions
and
such
changes
that
you
may
make,
my
regulation
although
i
may
quit
if
i
do
not
like
the
change.
is
that
the
same
relationship
that
a
draftee
undertakes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
relationship
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
that
the
employee
has
voluntarily
agreed
to
work
for
the
government
on
those
terms
and
is
that
not
the
traditional
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
hallmark
of
a
contractual
relationship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
terminated
at
will?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whenever
he
makes
the
change,
he
runs
the
risk
that
the
employee
may
say
well,
the
bargain
is
no
longer
attractive
to
me
so
i
will
now
terminate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
not
a
contract
what
it
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
also,
always
an
element
of
the
relationship
that
the
employee
agrees
to
accept
that
term?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
is
it
not
a
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
one
question.
i
think
you
say
the
congress
was
silent
about
the
problem
of
the
employee
exchange,
but
did
they
not
cite
the
keetz
case
during
the
legislative
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
we
have
the
same
problem
with
the
legislative
history
that
we
do
with
the
statute
itself
that
the
word
“contract”
is
perhaps
ambiguous,
i
understand
your
position
to
the
contrary
and
if
the
word
contract
is
construed
to
include
the
employee-employer
relationship
then
all
the
references
to
contractor
is
in
the
legislative
history
are
equally
ambiguous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
citing
four
cases
in
a
group
one
of
which
is
an
employee
case
and
the
other
three
are
third
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mcgrail,
i
do
not
seem
to
be
able
to
find
the
complaint
in
front
of
me.
does
your
complaint
allege
that
there
was
a
contract
between
your
client
or
the
decedent
in
the
exchanges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
it
allege
a
breach
of
that
contact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
abandon
in
effect
to
regulation
theory,
you
are
just
relying
on
the
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
rather
than
for
failure
of
the
said
claim,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
the
dismissal
did
the
court
rely
at
all
on
anything
outside
the
complaint,
did
it
rely
on
there
is
an
affidavit
by
somebody
in
the
record
i
believe?
what
is
the
record
before
us,
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
i
know
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
described
the
contract
in
any
detail
other
than
simply
saying
there
was
a
contract.
is
it
oral
or
written
or
what
is
the
character
of
the
contract,
can
we
tell
from
the
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
substance
of
the
contract
that
you
have
alleged?
is
it
turntable
at
will
or
at
is
it
for
a
fixed
term
or
what
is
it?
what
do
you
claim
the
contract
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
the
papers
which
describe
the
government’s
contractual
obligation?
are
they
the
regulations
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
there
should
be
a
hearing
and
the
district
court
should
conclude
after
looking
at
all
these
papers
that
they
do
not
constitute
a
contract
then
i
take
it
you
would
lose,
assuming
that
is
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
question.
i
assume,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
about
the
bricklayer
on
a
terminable
at
will
situation,
assume
your
man
had
a
terminable
at
will
contract,
but
did
not
get
paid
for
the
last
week
of
his
work,
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
he
would
have
no
way
of
getting
his
back
pay,
would
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
by
administrative
process
that
gave
it
to
him,
assume
they
denied
and
had
found
he
had
not
in
fact
worked
as
much
he
claimed,
you
would
say
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
he
would
be
entitled
to
be
paid
and
his
jurisdiction
of
court
of
claims
toward
back
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government’s
position
would
say
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
you
are
just
out
of
luck?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
his
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reich,
can
i
ask
one
other
question.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
reference
to
the
butler
case
which
is
a
case
that
held
as
i
understand
it
that
canal
commissioners
appointed
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania
did
not
have
a
contract
within
the
meaning
of
the
contracts
clause
of
the
constitution.
what
is
the
federal
case
that
you
rely
on
to
describe
this
concept
of
a
federal
employee
who
has
no
contractual
rights?
it
is
not
the
butler
case
surely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
the
leading
case
that
says
they
cannot
possibly
have
contractual
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
two
separate
theories.
one
might
say
that
the
contract
is
on
terminable
at
will
to
retain
the
sovereign’s
ability
to
change
personnel
and
alike.
that
is
not
necessarily
inconsistent
with
saying
that
the
relationship
is
nevertheless
fundamentally
contractual,
so
that
the
man
could
sue
for
back
pay
and
the
like
under
contract
theory.
they
are
not
necessarily
inconsistent,
but
you
say
these
line
of
cases,
the
only
one
i
look
at
is
butler,
these
cases
say
that
they
definitely
established
the
proposition
that
the
relationship
is
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
that
the
contract
is
one
--
