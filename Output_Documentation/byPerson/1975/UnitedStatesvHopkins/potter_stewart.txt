do
you
think
in
other
words
that
any
and
every
employee
except
for
a
federal
employee
has
a
contract
with
his
employer?
justice
potter
stewart
in
private
employment
and
in
this
argument
as
exchange
employee?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
terminable
at
will?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
i
may
suggest
in
this
question,
the
bricklayer
case,
if
he
does
do
an
hour’s
work
of
bricklaying
he
is
entitled
under
that
oral
contract
$8.50,
if
it
is
a
satisfactory
job
of
bricklaying
and
it
is
a
contract
to
that
extent,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
employer
might
fire
him
after
one
hour?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
might
terminate
the
contract
after
an
hour?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
terms
of
the
contact
could
be
decided
on
the
trial
on
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
my
brother
white’s
question
suggest,
judge
skelton’s
dissent
was
really
directed
more
to
the
merits,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
back
pay
is
his
pay?
pay
for
work
done
for
which
he
has
not
been
paid.
that
is
mr.
justice
white’s
question.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
contract
claim,
is
it
not?
