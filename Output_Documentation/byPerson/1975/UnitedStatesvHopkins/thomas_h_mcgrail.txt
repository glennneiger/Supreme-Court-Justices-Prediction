mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
brief
by
the
respondent
contains
three
arguments.
the
first
argument
is
that
the
respondent
had
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
exchange
service.
that
the
respondent
is
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
butler
cases.
that
the
record,
the
history
of
the
exchange
services
show
that
the
respondent
and
other
exchange
service
employees
are
contractual
and
not
federal
employees
and
that
will
be
the
argument
i
will
present
today.
in
my
brief,
however,
there
were
two
other
arguments,
arguments
2
and
3
in
which
are
raised
issues,
the
similar
types
of
the
raised
by
the
employee
and
testan.
the
testan
decision
by
this
court
last
month
rejected
those
decisions
--
those
contentions
and
therefore
my
arguments
2
and
3
are
now
moot.
however,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
testan
case
does
not
detract
from
the
first
argument
which
is
a
contraction
argument
and
as
i
will
later
point
out
actually
strengthens
it.
i
also
would
like
to
mention
that
my
arguments
2
and
3
do
contain
some
development
of
the
background
of
the
exchange
services
which
development
is
pertinent
to
my
argument
1,
and
therefore,
i
submit
respectfully
that
court
may
wish
to
review
arguments
2
and
3
for
the
purposes
of
the
background
facts,
but
i
will
not
be
able
to
cover
them
all
in
oral
argument.
the
ultimate
issue
here
is
not
necessarily
whether
this
employee
and
other
exchange
service
employees
are
in
some
vague
way
federal.
the
question
is
whether
the
butler
principle
should
be
extended
to
exchange
service
employees.
butler
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1850.
of
course
it
held
that
the
government
has
to
be
at
liberty
to
change
the
agents
which
carry
out
this
function
whenever
there
has
been
change
of
policy
or
change
administration
or
whatever.
i
submit
that
butler
is
obsolete
that
that
is
not
the
policy
now.
we
now
have
stability
in
the
executive
branch.
i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
renounce
butler.
i
am
just
asking
the
court
not
to
extend
it
to
exchange
service
employees.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes
your
honor.
it
begins
with
the
constitution,
article
2
section
2,
gives
the
congress
the
part,
directs
the
congress
or
rather
gives
congress
the
power
to
delegate
to
the
executive
the
employment
of
federal
employees
and
congress
has
done
that
by
statute
section
3101
of
title
v
of
the
u.s.
code
then
has
done
it
very
broadly
in
one
sentence.
section
3101,
“each
executive
agency,
militarily
department
and
the
government
of
the
district
of
columbia
may
employ
such
number
of
employees
of
the
various
classes
recognized
by
chapter
51
of
this
title
as
congress
may
appropriate
fore
from
year
to
year.”
that
is
the
delegation
to
the
executive
to
employ
federal
employees
whether
they
are
called
federal
employees,
public
officials,
or
inferior
officers
as
they
are
refereed
to
in
the
constitution
in
article
2,
section
2
that
is
the
delegation.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
and
i
am
saying
your
honor
in
response
to
that
the
basic
statute
in
which
congress
does
that
is
the
one
i
just
cited
because
that
statute
says
that
federal
employees
are
paid
out
of
appropriated
funds
and
exchange
service
employees
are
not
paid
out
of
appropriated
funds.
and
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
confirmed
in
chapter
51
which
is
this
general
authority
to
employ,
the
section
i
just
quoted,
cites
there
is
another
limitation
and
there
chapter
51
covers
all
civilian
employees,
all
civilian
positions
employees
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
it
says
this
chapter
does
not
apply
to
employees
whose
pay
is
not
wholly
from
appropriated
fund
of
the
united
states.
so
there
again
congress
has
said
that
federal
employees
are
that
only
if
they
are
paid
by
appropriated
funds
and
the
exchange
service
employees
are
not
paid
from
appropriated
funds.
the
government
counters
this
with
reference
to
section
2105(c)
and
that
was
the
section
in
which
the
definition
of
employee
in
title
v.
congress
in
that
section
said
that
exchange
services
employees
will
not
be
federal
employees
for
the
purpose
of
the
civil
service
laws
and
then
it
mentioned
one
or
two
exceptions
and
then
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
stated
a
moment
ago,
it
has
some
in
other
occasions
passed
statutes
whereby
certain
provisions
which
govern
federal
employees
are
extended
to
the
exchange
service
employees.
but
i
wish
to
emphasize
whenever
that
was
done.
it
was
done
expressly
and
explicitly
by
congress.
it
was
congress
extending
the
anti-discrimination
laws,
the
safety
program
laws
or
whatever
may
have
been
involved,
they
were
not
too
many,
it
was
congress
to
extending
those
to
exchange
service
employees,
it
was
not
bringing
exchange
service
employees
within
the
ambit
of
federal
employee.
so
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
it
is
correct.
congress
has
always
treated
the
service
employees
differently
from
federal
employees,
and
therefore,
they
would
not
be
within
the
butler
concept.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
during
my
argument,
i
had
pointed
out
that
the
fulcrum
of
federal
employees
of
article
2,
section
2
of
the
constitution
where
there
are
two
types
of
employees
referred
to
and
the
two
together
cover
all
federal
employees.
one
is
those
officers
who
are
confirmed
by
the
senate
and
the
other
consists
of
all
the
remaining
officers
or
officials
or
employees
of
the
federal
government
and
that
constitutional
provision
authorizes
congress
to
delegate
the
power
of
employing
those
individuals
to
the
executive.
congress
did
that
in
section
3101
and
in
doing
so,
limited
those
employees
to
persons
who
are
paid
out
of
appropriated
funds
and
of
course
the
exchange
service
employees
are
not.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
i
am
arguing
that
only
those
who
fall
within
that
clause
are
properly
in
the
category
of
federal
employees
or
officials
or
inferior
officers.
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case
your
honor
and
i
think
it
would
appear
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
article
2,
section
2,
and
butler
case
which
we
are
now
contending
with,
the
limitations
imposed
by
butler,
i
submit
is
directed
only
to
the
article
2,
section
2
employees.
the
government
argues
that
section
2105
(c)
indicates
that
congress
has
extended
the
concept
of
federal
employees
to
the
exchange
service
and
i
pointed
out
yesterday
that
in
addition
to
being
contrary
to
article
2,
section
2,
that
statutory
provision
does
not
do
so,
although
it
does
in
that
provision
in
several
others,
apply
certain
principles
which
are
generally
applied
to
federal
employees.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
respondent
prevails
on
that,
it
ends
the
case.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
--
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
it
would
end
the
case
because
the
only
reason
why
these
employees
would
not
have
an
enforceable
contract
of
employment
is
because
butler
said
inferior
officers
or
public
officials
do
not
have
it.
so
if
the
exchange
service
employees
are
not
in
the
category
contemplated
by
butler
then
there
is
a
contract
of
employment
which
can
be
enforced
and
the
1970
amendment
to
the
tucker
act
would
clearly
apply.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
it
is
also.
the
contention
by
the
government
that
the
amendment
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
suppliers
is
not
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
the
government
asks
or
says
there
is
no
reference
to
px
employees
in
the
legislative
history.
it
so
happens
there
is.
there
is
no
reference,
however,
in
the
senate
report
or
the
house
report
or
the
debate
to
supply
contractors,
although
the
px’s
deal
with
billions
of
dollars
a
year
in
supplies
which
they
sell
at
retail,
there
is
no
reference
to
any
suppliers
in
the
legislative
history.
now,
the
reference
to
the
employees
in
the
legislative
history
is
the
keetz
case
which
is
a
very
significant
case
and
the
borden
case,
not
just
one
employee
case,
but
two
of
them.
congress
in
both
reports
said,
there
is
a
gap
or
a
loophole
in
the
course
jurisdiction
formed
by
borden,
keetz,
pulaski,
and
kyer.
two
were
employee
cases;
two
were
personal
service
cases.
the
government
suggests
that
congress
did
not
understand
what
those
cases
were
about.
i
submit
it
is
elemental
and
statutory
construction
that
we
assume
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
and
these
bills
came
out
of
the
judiciary
committee
composed
of
lawyers,
and
furthermore,
trial
judge
spector
of
the
court
of
claims
was
a
witness
before
the
committee
on
behalf
of
the
american
bar
association.
mr.
spector
was
formerly
chairman
of
the
armed
service
board
of
contract
appeals
and
is
recognized
as
one
of
the
leading
authorities
on
federal
contract
and
employee
law,
and
he
did
refer
to,
in
his
statement
presented
to
the
committee,
he
did
refer
to
the
employee
situation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
pointed
out
there
is
a
difference
between
px
employees
who
have
a
contract
and
regular
federal
employees.
at
the
march
4,
1969
hearings
at
page
10,
he
stated,
regular
civilian
employees
of
the
government,
unlike
those
of
non-appropriated
fund
activities
are
not
employed
by
contract.
thus,
he
is
saying
to
the
committee,
px
employees
have
a
contract,
federal
employees
do
not
and
he
cited
the
bouchea
case
which
unfortunately
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
but
is
cited
at
page
10
of
those
hearings
which
was
an
employee
of
the
px
who
was
fired
or
demoted
and
he
went
to
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals,
and
they
did
not
turn
him
down
because
he
did
not
have
a
contract
relationships.
they
turned
him
down
because
their
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
contracts
where
there
is
a
standard
government
disputes
clause.
everyone
recognized
that
there
was
a
contract
relationship.
in
the
keetz
case
which
is
one
of
the
four
cases
that
the
congress
relied
on
in
passing
this
legislation,
the
government
took
the
very
strong
position
that
exchange
service
employees
have
contracts.
it
argued
and
i
quote,
“it
is
patently
not
true
that
the
claim
is
not
founded
on
contract.”
it
is
patently
not
true
the
government
said
at
that
time
that
the
exchange
service
employees’
relationship
was
not
founded
in
contract.
the
court
of
claims
picked
that
case
up
in
this
case,
the
hopkins
case
below,
and
referred
to
the
fact
the
government
has
previously
taken
the
position
that
they
have
contracts
of
employment
and
stated,
we
find
it
a
bit
ironic
that
in
the
instant
case,
the
government
argues
just
the
opposite.
we
can
only
assume
that
this
inconsistency
has
occurred
because
the
enactment
of
public
law
91350
now
grants
jurisdiction
for
exchange
contract
employees.
we,
the
court
of
claims
speaking
in
this
case,
we
hold
the
government’s
contract
area
in
keetz
to
be
correct
and
see
no
reason
to
change
in
the
instant
case.
why
did
congress
pass
the
1970
amendment?
because
the
court
of
claims
in
borden,
and
keetz
and
in
kyer
said
there
is
a
harsh
result
here.
these
people
have
no
court
to
go
to,
and
the
senate
and
house
both
said
that
is
why
we
are
passing
this
legislation.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
no,
he
did
not.
the
reference
to
employees
is
through
the
keetz
case
and
the
borden
case
and
through
mr.
spector’s
statement.
but
i
think
mr.
justice
stevens
in
his
comment
yesterday
may
have
pointed
to
the
answer.
congress
was
aware
that
these
employees
had
contracts,;it
was
aware
that
there
were
personal
service
contracts
with
the
exchange
service,
and
obviously
was
aware
that
there
were
billions
of
dollars
of
supply
contracts.
it
did
not
isolate
in
its
reports
supply
contracts.
it
just
referred
to
contracts
and
contractors.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
not
in
respect
to
federal
employees,
but
i
think
in
respect
to
non-federal
employees
it
is
recognized
or
understood
the
language
may
not
be
contractual
or
legal
contractual
language,
but
i
think
that
it
is
recognized
at
least
by
lawyers
that
the
employer-employee
relationship
is
clearly
contractual
what
else
can
it
be?
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct,
because
that
is
what
the
1970
amendment
directs
in
respect
to
all
contracts.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
definitely
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
it
alleges
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
in
the
alternative
it
alleges
breach
of
the
regulations.
of
course
it
was
filed
before
testan
so
there
were
alternatives
here.
one
of
which
--
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
there
is
no
answer
filed
and
of
course
no
discovery
and
there
is
no
record
before
the
court
other
than
the
fact
the
government
did
submit
what
they
have
attached
to
their
brief
in
this
case,
a
government
paper
that
shows
the
positions
held
by
the
respondent
at
various
times
and
the
government
submits
that
for
the
proposition
that
the
respondent
was
“appointed”
to
his
position
or
he
was
a
federal
employee.
there
was
nothing
else
in
there
record
for
the
court
to
rely
on.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
no,
the
contract,
i
contend,
is
not
a
document
that
states
contract
of
employment.
the
contract
would
be
formed
by
the
appointment
papers
which
the
employee,
respondent,
would
have
signed.
the
government
--
the
exchange
service
had
superimposed
on
themselves
the
same
format
that
the
civil
service
uses
in
respect
to
employees.
so
the
same
type
of
documents
would
exist,
and
i
say
those
documents
would
constitute
the
written
contract.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
it
is
a
contract
whereby
the
government
agreed
to
pay
this
individual,
permit
him
to
work
and
not
fire
him
except
for
cause,
disability,
inefficiency,
and
the
contractor
or
the
employee
agreed
to
work,
comply
with
the
regulations
and
to
do
his
job.
he,
i
will
concede,
had
the
prerogative
to
withdraw
at
anytime
which
is
not
untypical
of
contracts
which
it
is
between
management
and
labor
and
which
are
enforced.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
these
would
be
regulations
and
circulars,
primarily
the
regulations
plus
the
appointment
to
use
that
term.
the
government
uses
the
appointment
papers.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
but
that
would
be
a
very
unusual
result
because
either
these
individual
had
a
contract
or
he
was
a
federal
employee.
i
see
no
possible
alliterative.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
unless
it
is
in
the
government
butler
type
situation
i
see
not
alternative,
but
a
contractual
relationship.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
well,
the
unions
of
course
provide
a
much
greater
force
than
the
individual
employee
in
contracting
with
the
employer.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
the
individual,
i
submit
your
honor
does
negotiate
when
he
asks
for
a
job
even
a
very
simple
job.
secretary
comes
in
ask
for
a
job
--
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
pardon?
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
well,
your
honor
if
there
are
terms
to
the
contract
specific
performance
is
not
available
frequently
if
not
always
in
respect
to
personal
service
contracts,
but
the
contracts
can
be
enforced
if
there
is
a
breach
by
the
employer.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
if
the
contractor
says
to
a
bricklayer,
i
have
a
job
out
here.
this
is
going
to
take
one
week
and
i
agree
that
you
can
work
for
the
full
week
and
do
that
entire
job
for
one
week
and
if
you
do
it
properly
you
have
a
guarantee
that
you
will
work
for
one
week
and
if
--
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
the
terms
you
just
stated,
that
is
all
it
is
your
honor
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
enforced
there.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
it
is
terminable
at
will
your
honor,
that
contract,
but
we
do
not
have
a
terminable
at
will
contract
here
because
the
exchange
service
has
said
we
will
not
fire
you,
unless
you
are
inefficient,
unless
you
are
disabled,
or
unless
we
have
a
cause
and
the
causes,
various
cause
are
as
follows.
otherwise,
we
will
not
fire
you.
that
is
enforceable.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
well,
it
is
not
a
(voice
overlap)
but
we
do
not
have
a
contract
at
will
here.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
it
would
your
honor,
but
you
see
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
employee
situation
here
when
it
passed
this
bill
and
has
stated,
there
is
one
little
loophole
we
want
to
close
it.
i
say
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
whether
these
exchange
service
employees
had
a
contract
for
basis;
congress
here
mandated
that
they
did
by
treating
them
as
they
have
over
the
years
that
federal
government
and
the
courts
have
treated
these
employees
as
contractual.
congress
was
fully
aware
of
that
one
when
it
passed
this
bill.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
i
am
aware
of
judge
skelton’s
(ph)
dissent
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
because
judge
skelton
thought
this
was
terminable
at
will
and
i
respectfully
consider,
i
believe
that
as
incorrect.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
no,
i
would
say,
it
would
not
be
correct,
but
when
the
case
went
back
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
of
claims
would
dismiss
it
because
there
was
no
contract
to
be
enforced.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
i
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
there
is
jurisdiction
at
the
court
of
--
mr.
thomas
h.
mcgrail
yes,
because
they
say
that
butler
applies
and
exchange
service
employees
are
federal
employees
contrary
to
the
statute
and
contrary
to
the
fact
that
throughout
the
history
until
this
amendment
the
government
and
courts
have
treated
these
employees
as
contract
employees
and
not
federal.
and
congress
recognized
this,
was
aware
of
this
when
it
passed
the
1970
amendment
and
stated
its
strong
positions
that
it
wanted
to
close
this
gap
formed
by
keetz
as
completely
as
possible
so
there
would
be
no
opportunity
and
i
now
quote
from
the
senate
report
“which
would
ultimately
serve
to
create
additional
loopholes
through
which
clever
defendants
may
ultimately
retreat
and
to
the
anachronism
of
the
governmental
immunity
that
the
bill
seeks
to
eradicate.”
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
status
of
these
employees
as
contractual
and
that
is
why
--
and
was
aware
of
the
supply
contracts
because
a
personal
service
contract
as
also
and
just
refer
generally
to
contracts
and
contractors,
made
no
specific
mention
to
any
of
them
and
as
i
said
before
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
addresses
itself
to
the
major
contractors
of
these
exchanges,
the
supply
contractors.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
