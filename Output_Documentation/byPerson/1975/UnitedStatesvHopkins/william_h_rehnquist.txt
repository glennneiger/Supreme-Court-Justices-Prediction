there
are
certain
inconsistencies
in
your
argument
mr.
reich
and
i
think
there
probably
is
in
your
opponent's
too.
you
have
to
argue
that
they
are
not
government
employees
for
one
purpose
and
yet
they
are
for
another
and
he
has
to
take
just
the
opposite
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reich,
am
i
right
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
back
pay
act,
an
admitted
government
employee
had
no
money
remedy
against
the
government
for
a
claimed
violation
of
his
tenure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
has
that
not
appropriated
money
here
to
pay
judgments
that
are
rendered
by
the
court
of
claims
that
it
has
to
be
third
party
contractors
under
the
19
--?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
your
opponent
is
right,
presumably
congress
is
likewise
prepared
to
appropriate
money
to
pay
judgments
for
people
such
as
the
respondent
in
this
case
and
then
seek
reimbursement
from
the
exchange
service?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
mcgrail
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
only
categories
of
people
who
can
find
the
employment
with
the
federal
government
are
those
who
are
appointed
in
conformity
with
the
appointments
clause,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
that
is
true,
but
when
you
go
from
inferior
officers
to
just
employees,
there
are
a
couple
of
old
cases
from
this
court
that
talk
about
one
man
who
was
appointed
by
an
assistant
surgeon
or
something
like
that
may
say
he
is
just
an
employee,
he
is
not
under
the
appointments
clause
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
position
is
sustained
here
mr.
mcgrail,
mechanically
i
take
it
the
court
of
claims
would
render
a
judgment,
the
treasury
would
pay
the
judgment,
and
then
seek
reimbursement
from
the
exchange,
just
as
it
would
with
a
third
party
contractor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
access
under
the
back
pay
act,
do
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
difference
between
you
and
the
respondent
here
is
that
he
does
not
have
access
under
the
back
pay
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
idea
is
no
access
to
the
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
must,
for
reinstatement
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reich,
if
government
employment
of
a
kind
that
you
have
and
i
have
is
a
contract,
i
suppose
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
the
back
pay
act,
since
either
one
of
us
could
have
sued
under
the
tucker
act
in
the
court
of
claims?
