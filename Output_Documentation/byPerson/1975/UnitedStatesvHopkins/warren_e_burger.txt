warren
e.

counsel
you
may
proceed
whenever

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
that
the
congress
has
always
tended
to
treat
the
employees
of
exchanges
in
separate
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
my
question
mr.
mcgrail
went
to,
what
i
thought
it
was
(inaudible)
congress
to
deal
with
exchange
employees,
way
different
from
and
separately
from
the
civil
service
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
10
oâ€™clock
in
the
morning
mr.
mcgrail.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
the
untied
states
against
hopkins.
mr.
mcgrail
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
other
very
important
question
in
this
case
whether
the
1970
amendment
granted
rights
with
respect
to
employees
or
put
it
broadly
people
working
for
the
government
or
whether
it
was
intended
to
be
limited
to
contractors
with
the
government
suppliers,
is
that
not
really
a
fulcrum
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
correct.
those
statements
of
the
court
of
claims
are
entirely
consistent
with
what
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
said
in
describing
it
as
under
the
tiding
statements
i
am
referring
to
where
he
said
that
this
amendment
will
provide
the
contractors,
the
people
who
are
selling
goods
and
services
to
non-appropriated
fund
agencies,
with
the
means
of
suit
and
remedy
and
omission.
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
say
anything
about
employees,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
people,
employees
as
having
contracts
mr.
mcgrail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
whether
the
1970
amendment
alleges
suing
under
the
tucker
act,
even
if
you
were
correct
on
your
composition
about
the
contract,
if
the
1970
amendment
did
not
apply
to
employees,
then
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case
too,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
reich?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
was
just
an
employee
or
a
person
engaged
in
that
activity
has
no
remedy
if
they
do
not
give
them
his
paycheck
at
the
end
of
the
pay
period,
which
you
say
he
does
not
have
a
remedy
under
the
tucker
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
