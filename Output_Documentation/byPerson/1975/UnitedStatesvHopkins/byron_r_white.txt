justice

that
is
all
you
really
need
to
argue
is
just
the
statutory.
if
you
win
on
that,
you
need
--
justice
byron
r.
white
only
because
then
for
purposes
of
the
issue
in
this
case,
these
people
would
not
be
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
would
it
end
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
cases
which
say
that
employees
of
the
united
states
do
not
operate
or
they
are
not
under
a
contract,
it
is
not
a
contractual
arrangement.
if
you
are
not
an
employee
of
the
united
states,
the
usual
jurisprudence
it
that
it
is
a
contractual
employment
and
that
is
what
you
argue?
justice
byron
r.
white
supposing
jurisdiction,
i
suppose
you
would
argue
--
you
stated
the
cause
of
action
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
judge
skelton
went
to
a
great
length
to
demonstrate
his
satisfaction
that
once
the
exchange
service
terminated
his
employment
which
he
had
a
right
to
do
without
liability,
all
of
his
contract
rights
were
also
terminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
it
was
terminable
at
will,
let
us
just
assume
that
for
a
moment,
would
the
jurisdictional
holding
here
be
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
the
jurisdictional
holding
was
correct,
that
it
was
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
think
it
is
a
contract
claim
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
if
the
contract
was
terminable
at
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
claim
was
asserting
something
in
in
futoro?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
a
claim
in
the
court
of
claims
that
the
plaintiff
had
worked
for
an
exchange
and
had
not
been
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
back
pay,
somebody
says
you
owe
me
some
money
for
some
work
i
did
for
you,
is
that
a
contractual
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
does
this
gentleman
prevail
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
exchange
employees
are
not
employees
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
not
what
the
court
of
claims
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
decided
there
were
not
employees
of
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
we
apply
the
same
label
with
analysis,
they
were
not.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
they
gave
an
indication
that
any
contract
claims
with
the
exchanges
could
be
sued
on,
that
is
what
they
said
and
then
if
you
agree
that
a
non-federal
employee
has
a
contract
claim,
why
does
it
not
cover
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
even
employees
for
purposes
of
civil
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
amendment
would
have
to
indicate
congressional
intention
to
include
them
much
more
clearly?
