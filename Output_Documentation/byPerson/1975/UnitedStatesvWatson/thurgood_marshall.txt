justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
this
is
all
very
short
term?
justice
thurgood
marshall
consent
was
very
shortly
after?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
can
you
do
about
the
government's
position
that
it
was
exigent
at
the
time
that
he
was
committing
the
last
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
not
convicted
on
the
first
one
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
see
any
significance
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
when
he
saw
the
crime
committed
in
his
presence
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
he
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
saw
the
possession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
cigarette
being
lit
mean?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
the
credit
cards
in
the
car
in
his
possession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
in
his
possession?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
understand
you
that
if
he
said
i
will
arrest
you
for
having
a
credit
card
on
your
possession
as
of
this
time,
everything
would
be
alright?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
problem
is
he
did
not
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
both
statements
on
what
police
usually
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
not
cite
that,
instead
of
bring
it
out
of
the
air?
you
should
cite
that
gave
rule,
that
the
usual
rule
is
that
a
police
officer
may
arrest
without
a
warrant.
one
believed
by
the
office
of
unreasonable
cause
to
have
been
guilty
of
a
felony?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
see
any
exigent
circumstance
in
what
i
have
just
quoted
to
you,
and
you
will
find
that
in
carroll
against
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
in
that
phrase,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
the
usual
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
usual
rule
does
not
have
exigent
circumstances
in
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
usual
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
to
tell
us
that
where
a
man
is
committing
a
crime
that
exigent
circumstances
got
to
be
shown?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
he
not
possessing
a
credit
card
illegally
in
the
officer’s
presence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
officer
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
different
from
the
miranda,
this
man
says
specifically
whether
about
finding
that
car
i
am
going
to
use?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
said,
despite
that
go
ahead
and
take
it
and
use
it,
that
is
what
in
substance
he
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
and
in
this
case,
he
did
tell
them,
so
that
takes
that
dissent
out
of
your
picture?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
he
had
worked
with
the
same
inspector,
had
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
knew
a
little
bit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
said
i
know
my
rights,
did
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
“i
know,
do
not
bother
frank.
i
know
my
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
said
so.
i
know.
