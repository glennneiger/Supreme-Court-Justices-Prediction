what
are
those
cases?
justice

there
had
been
many
cases
in
which
the
validity
of
the
arrest
has
been
assumed,

why
do
say
that
he
did
not
believe
the
informant
when
the
informant
lit
up
the
cigarette?
justice

but
was
it
that
triggered
his
approach
to
the
respondent,

it
not
and
the
arrest?
justice

but
why

but
it
was
arranged,
that
it
was
pre-determined
that
the
signal
should
be
the
lighting
of
cigarette?
justice

and
when
the
cigarette
was
lighted,
his
friend,
the

arrested
him?

objective
facts
would

was
the
signal,
a
pre-arranged
signal?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
arrest
in
a
public
place?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
do
not
test
the
validity
of
an
arrest,
but
ultimately
it
turns
out

overlap)
do
a
search.

whether
or

he
had
any

had
nothing
to
do
with
the
reason
he
made
it.
