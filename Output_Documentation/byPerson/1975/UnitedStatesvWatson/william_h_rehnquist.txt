justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
amounted
to
a
statement
that
a
respondent
like
the
one
here
who
had
been
illegally
arrested
could
not
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
give
a
valid
consent
to
a
search
of
his
car?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
not
the
holding
in
schneckloth
limited
to
the
non-custodial
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
failed
to
carry
its
burden
where,
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
district
court
order
suppression?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
just
in
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
district
court
suppress
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
district
court
found
in
favor
of
the
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
all
cases
have
required
warrants
in
this
situation,
were
you
talking
about
arrest
and
not
a
search?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
case
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
said
cases.
what
cases
from
this
court
are
you
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
searches?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
you
get
back
to
answering
my
question,
which
is
about
the
cases
that
you
said
a
moment
ago
held
that
all
that
warrant
was
required
for
arrest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
cases
are
those?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
all
of
the
cases
held
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
did
not
qualify
that
way
when
you
said
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
had
been
numerous
cases
from
this
court
that
hold
probable
causes
sufficient
for
an
arrest
of
a
person,
have
there
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
one
reason
for
distinguishing
private
property
is
that
that
is
a
fact
situation
which
was
deemed
to
important
in
coolidge
as
to
the
situs
of
the
car?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
if
no
person
were
involved?
you
mean
if
there
had
been
nobody
at
home,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
alright
to
search
the
home?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
rights;
you
mean
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
i
did
not
realize
that
was
involved
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
when
he
says,
i
consent,
he
has
incriminated
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
that
analysis,
yes,
but
under
any
other
analysis
that
has
ever
been
supported
by
any
judicial
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
if
the
police
officer
says
to
your
client
will
you
let
me
go
in
your
car
and
he
says
yes,
i
will,
that
his
statement
“yes,
i
will”
incriminates
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
tell
me
just
why
you
think
it
incriminates
him
under
our
cases?
