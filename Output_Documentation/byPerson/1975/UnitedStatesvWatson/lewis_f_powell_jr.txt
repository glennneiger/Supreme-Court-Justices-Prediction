mr.
nasatir,
do
you
think
this
consent
could
have
been
exculpatory
in
the
minds
of
your
client?
in
other
words,
he
seemed
confident
that
the
police
would
find
nothing,
if
the
police
found
nothing
they
well
would
have
not
arrested
him?

unlike
a
confession
in
that
respect,
is
it
not?
if
one
consents
to
search,
do
you
not
think
the
chances
are
that
he
thinks
nothing
would
be
found
that
incriminates
him?
