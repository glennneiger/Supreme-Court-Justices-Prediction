mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
reversing
respondent's
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
the
stolen
credit
cards
he
was
convicted
of
possessing,
have
been
obtained
by
postal
inspectors
during
an
illegal
search
of
respondent’s
automobile
and
should
have
been
suppressed
as
evidence
at
his
trial.
i
will
state
the
case
at
some
length
not
because
the
facts
are
particularly
complicated,
but
because
they
demonstrate
so
convincingly
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
erroneous
and
should
be
reversed.
on
august
17,
1972,
postal
inspector
frank
barbarick
(ph)
received
the
telephone
call
from
awad
khoury,
an
informant
who
had
supplied
accurate
information
to
barbarick
on
a
number
of
prior
occasions.
the
informant
told
barbarick
that
respondent
watson
was
in
possession
of
a
stole
bank
of
america
credit
card
and
planned
to
turn
the
card
over
to
khoury.
later
that
day,
khoury
met
with
barbarick
and
turned
over
the
credit
card
such
as
he
had
described.
the
inspector
ascertained
from
the
bank
of
america
that
the
credit
card
had
been
mailed
three
days
earlier
and
had
never
reached
its
intended
customer.
the
informant
told
barbarick
that
he
and
respondent
had
an
agreement.
respondent
would
furnish
the
informant
with
additional
credit
cards
stolen
from
the
mail
and
the
informant
would
purchase
airline
tickets
and
merchandise
with
the
cards.
inspector
barbarick
instructed
the
informant
to
set
up
another
meeting
with
the
respondent
to
obtain
the
additional
credit
cards.
although
there
was
sufficient
time
to
have
obtained
a
warrant
for
respondent’s
arrest
during
the
time
that
passed
between
this
initial
contact
and
the
actual
arrest,
the
postal
inspector
made
no
attempt
to
do
so.
after
several
postponements,
the
meeting
was
finally
held
between
the
informant
and
respondent
at
noon
on
the
23rd
of
august,
in
a
restaurant
in
los
angeles.
at
the
designated
time,
the
informant
met
and
at
a
nearby
table
there
were
two
postal
inspectors
stationed.
inspector
barbarick
had
instructed
the
informant
that
if
respondent
were
in
possession
of
stolen
credit
cards,
the
informant
should
light
a
cigarette
as
a
signal
to
the
surveillance
agents
in
the
restaurant.
the
agents
would
then
activate
a
beeper
which
would
inform
agents
positioned
outside
the
restaurant.
at
the
meeting,
the
informant
learned
that
respondent
had
the
credit
cards
outside
in
his
car.
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
the
agents
in
turn
activated
their
signal,
inspector
barbarick
and
other
agents
entered
the
restaurant
and
placed
respondent
under
arrest
for
possession
of
stolen
mail
and
specifically
for
possession
of
the
card
that
the
informant
had
turned
over
to
inspector
barbarick
six
days
earlier.
the
inspectors
escorted
respondent
out
of
the
crowded
restaurant
and
searched
him.
but
they
did
not
find
the
credit
cards
on
this
person.
respondent
was
then
given
miranda
warnings.
the
respondent
who
had
previously
been
an
informant
for
inspector
barbarick
and
who
knew
him
well
said
in
response
to
the
miranda
warnings,
frank,
which
was
barbarick’s
first
name,
i
understand
my
rights.
the
inspector
then
asked
respondent
where
his
automobile
was
located
and
respondent
pointed
to
a
car
nearby.
and
the
inspector
said,
can
i
look
inside
and
respondent
said,
go
ahead.
then
the
inspector
said
you
know
if
i
find
anything
it
is
going
to
go
against
you
and
respondent
said,
go
ahead,
there
is
nothing
in
there.
the
respondent
then
gave
the
inspector
the
keys
which
opened
the
locked
car
and
inspector
barbarick
and
another
inspector
searched
the
car
and
found
under
the
floor
mat
an
envelope
containing
two
pieces
of
stolen
mail
each
with
credit
cards
inside
them.
these
two
pieces
of
mail
together
with
these
two
credit
cards,
together
with
the
credit
card
supplied
six
days
or
earlier
by
the
informant
formed
the
basis
of
the
indictment
returned
against
respondent
for
possession
stolen
mail.
prior
to
trial,
respondent
moved
to
suppress
the
stolen
credit
cards.
he
made
several
arguments.
first
that
the
informant
was
not
a
reliable
informant,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
arrest
respondent.
second,
that
a
warrant
was
required
for
respondent’s
arrest.
and
third,
that
respondent’s
consent
to
the
search
of
his
automobile
was
invalid
because
he
had
not
been
told
that
he
could
withhold
his
consent.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
and
respondent’s
trial
proceeded.
he
was
convicted
by
the
jury
on
two
counts,
involving
the
credit
cards
found
under
the
floor
mat
of
his
automobile.
he
was
acquitted
on
a
count
involving
the
credit
card
turned
over
six
days
earlier
to
the
informant,
by
the
informant
rather
to
the
inspector.
the
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction.
the
majority
concluded
that
the
information
gathered
by
inspector
barbarick
from
the
informant
was
reliable.
it
was
confirmed
by
physical
receipt
of
a
stolen
credit
card,
that
it
did
provide
probable
cause
to
arrest
respondent,
and
therefore,
it
rejected
that
argument
that
respondent
had
made.
it
held,
however,
that
because
the
officers
had
not
sought
or
obtained
a
warrant
for
respondent’s
arrest
during
the
six
days
between
the
acquisition
of
probable
cause
in
the
meeting
at
the
restaurant,
the
arrest
was
unconstitutional.
proceeding
from
that
conclusion,
the
majority
then
held
that
the
consent
respondent
gave
to
search
his
automobile
was
defective.
it
purported
to
adhere
to
the
totality
of
all
the
circumstances
test
annunciated
by
this
court
in
schneckloth
against
bustamonte,
but
stated
nevertheless
that
the
consent
was
involuntary
because
respondent
was
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
expressly
put
it
in
on
those
words,
but
every
single
fact
that
would
bear
on
the
actual
voluntariness
of
respondent’s
actions
tended
to
point
toward
voluntariness
and
i
think
it
must
be
viewed
in
effect
upon
analysis
as
a
per
se
rule
there
would
be
three
factors:
(1)
custody
(2)
illegal
and
(3)
the
lack
of
a
specific
miranda
type
warning
of
a
right
to
withhold
consent.
although
as
i
will
argue
later,
there
was
effectively
a
communication
of
the
right
to
withhold
consent
in
this
case.
the
case
thus
presents
the
court
today
with
two
issues.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
rule
on
the
arrest
issue
would
turn
on
certain
facts
i
think.
in
other
words,
it
would
turn
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
an
opportunity,
whether
in
fact
they
had
acquired
probable
cause,
whether
they
had
an
opportunity
subsequent
to
the
acquisition
of
probable
cause
to
obtain
a
warrant.
the
rule
then
would
be
that
an
arrest
is
illegal
if
they
had
acquired
probable
cause
and
had
passed
up
the
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant.
so
in
that
sense
i
suppose
it
is
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
would
be
equivalent
to
the
emergency
doctrine
for
search
warrants
of
homes,
that
is
the
government
would
be
required
to
show
exigent
circumstances
that
justify
the
failure
to
get
a
warrant,
otherwise
the
arrest
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
an
arrest
warrant?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct
and
it
is
definitely
a
new
rule.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
is
a
per
se
rule,
although
unlikely
rule
on
--
the
rule
on
the
consent
issue,
you
look
at
three
relatively
concrete
isolated
and
inflexible
kinds
of
facts
and
if
you
find
those
three
facts
then
there
cannot
be
a
valid
consent.
here
there
is
a
factual
inquiry
into
exigent
circumstances
which
cannot
be
pinned
down
as
quite
as
specific
a
narrow
inquiry,
but
it
is
a
per
se
rule
ones
you
gotten
across
the
factual
threshold.
now,
the
two
questions
that
are
presented
to
the
court
today,
both
the
question
regarding
the
need
to
obtain
a
warrant
for
and
arrest
and
the
question
regarding
the
ability
of
one
in
custody
and
in
illegal
custody
to
consent
to
a
search
are
questions
of
great
practical
importance
to
everyday
law
enforcement.
i
believe,
turning
first
to
the
arrest
issue,
that
it
would
be
a
considerable
understatement
to
say
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
represents
a
sharp
break
with
tradition
and
history.
the
federal
rule,
the
rule
in
each
of
the
50
states,
the
common
rule,
the
rule
i
dare
say
that
each
of
you
learn
as
black
letter
law
during
your
first
year
criminal
law
course
in
law
school
is
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
may
make
a
warrantless
arrest
for
felony
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause,
at
least
so
long
as
the
arrest
does
not
entail
an
entering
to
a
dwelling
or
similar
place.
this
proposition
has
been
recognized
in
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
during
the
past
50
years
from
the
carroll
case
to
last
term’s
decision
in
gerstein
against
pugh.
it
is
reflected
in
section
3061
of
title
xviii
of
the
united
states
code
which
authorized
inspector
barbarick
to
arrest
respondent
without
a
warrant
on
the
very
circumstances
of
this
case.
neither
we
nor
respondent
have
been
able
to
find
a
single
case
in
the
entire
annals
of
anglo-american
jurisprudence
holding
otherwise.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
coolidge
case,
but
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
coolidge
does
not
support
the
conclusion
it
reached.
coolidge
was
clearly
and
repeatedly
focused
upon
the
problem
of
an
entry
into
a
dwelling
or
similar
place,
a
privacy
invasion
of
that
nature
in
connection
with
an
arrest.
we
have
no
similar
ingredient
in
the
present
case.
given
this
background
then,
i
submit
that
even
if
it
were
otherwise
desirable,
this
court
would
not
be
free
to
overturn
this
consistent
and
heavyweight
of
precedent
and
to
hold
that
this
time
for
the
first
time,
warrants
are
required
as
a
constitutional
matter.
even
if
the
court
did
consider
itself
free
as
a
jurisprudential
matter
to
adapt
a
radical
constitutional
departure
embodied
in
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there
are
good
reasons
of
policy
and
practice
that
counsel
against
such
as
then
and
we
have
made
these
arguments
in
our
brief
and
we
advance
them
without
intending
in
any
way
to
minimize
the
seriousness
of
being
arrested.
we
recognize
that
an
arrest
is
an
intrusion
into
individual
liberty
of
substantial
dimensions.
we
recognize
that
the
this
court
has
repeatedly
looked
carefully
at
the
circumstances
surrounding
an
arrest
and
has
required
that
the
officers
have
substantial
justification
amounting
to
probable
cause
in
order
to
make
a
lawful
arrest.
the
question
here
of
course
is
whether
a
warrant
should
be
required.
i
think
there
is
one
structural
difference
which
i
would
like
to
mention
this
morning
between
a
search
of
a
dwelling
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
absence
of
exigent
circumstances
does
require
a
warrant
and
an
arrest.
if
a
warrantless
search
is
made
and
items
are
seized
or
indeed,
if
nothing
is
seized,
there
is
no
judicial
accounting
that
necessarily
takes
place
as
a
result
of
that
action.
it
may
never
come
to
the
attention
of
the
courts,
indeed
this
is
the
problem
i
think
that
underlies
the
whole
rational
of
the
warrant
requirement.
the
reason
that
has
impelled
this
court
to
impose
a
warrant
requirement
is
to
ensure
some
degree
of
judicial
supervision.
only
upon
a
motion
for
suppression
of
evidence
or
return
of
property
which
may
be
made
many
months
later
by
the
person
who
was
the
subject
of
the
search
is
their
judicial
review.
quite
the
contrary
is
the
case
where
an
individual
is
arrested,
the
law,
both
federally
and
in
the
states
and
as
a
result
of
gerstein
against
pugh
requires
a
reasonably
prompt
judicial
determination
of
the
adequacy
of
the
grounds
underlying
the
arrest.
this
to
us
is
a
substantial
counterweight
neutralizing
to
some
extent
the
desirability
that
otherwise
might
be
viewed
to
exist
for
obtaining
a
warrant
prior
to
arrest.
there
are
also
a
lot
of
practical
problems
with
requiring
an
arrest
warrant
and
this
case
i
think
illustrates
very
well
some
of
those
problems.
even
when
suspicion
focuses
on
a
suspect,
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
arrest
them
is
often
not
made
immediately.
instead,
further
investigation
is
undertaken,
either
with
the
goal
of
securing
additional
evidence
or
alternatively
of
demonstrating
the
suspect’s
innocence.
here
an
effort
was
made
to
obtain
further
confirmation
by
catching
respondent
red-handed
with
stolen
credit
cards,
if
it
was
possible
to
do
so
and
indeed
it
was
successful
in
this
case.
now,
respondent
seeks
to
explain
a
way
our
arguments
that
it
is
undesirable
to
force
officers
to
seek
warrants
as
soon
as
they
have
acquired
probable
cause
by
saying
that
well,
the
police
can
wait.
they
do
not
have
to
acquire
a
warrant
right
away.
the
only
thing
they
have
to
do
is
get
a
warrant
before
making
the
arrest.
but
i
think
that
argument
does
not
work
because
as
in
this
case,
once
the
decision
is
made
to
arrest,
the
need
often
is
sudden
to
do
so.
here
in
other
words,
the
investigation
was
proceeding.
i
think
it
is
quite
apparent
for
my
recitation
of
the
facts
that
no
decision
had
been
made
whether
or
not
to
arrest
the
respondent
or
when
to
arrest
him,
until
the
signal
was
given
in
the
restaurant
which
indicated
that
he
was
in
possession
of
additional
stolen
credit
cards.
at
that
point,
he
was
--
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
then
and
there
committing
a
new
crime.
not
to
say
that
because
they
have
failed
to
get
a
warrant
previously,
they
were
powerless
to
arrest
them
seems
to
me
a
very
undesirable
result.
indeed,
even
if
the
innovation
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
constitutional
law
of
arrest
were
correct
as
a
general
proposition,
it
was
wrongly
applied
to
this
case
because
here
there
was
probable
cause,
fresh
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
respondent
for
a
fresh
offense.
i
would
like
to
turn
the
question
of
the
voir
dire
of
respondent’s
consent
to
the
search
of
his
automobile.
and
i
hark
back
to
some
of
the
facts
of
the
case
as
i
stated
earlier.
the
respondent
knew
the
arresting
officer.
he
was
on
a
first
name
basis
with
him.
the
situation
was
casual
even
friendly.
and
the
dialogue
indicated
a
request
for
consent
to
search.
a
consent
followed,
by
a
warning
that
if
anything
were
found
it
would
go
against
the
respondent,
followed
by
a
repeated,
almost
a
demand
that
the
inspector
search
the
automobile.
so
obvious
from
those
facts,
the
respondent
not
only
willingly
consented
to
the
search,
but
that
he
believe
it
would
benefit
him
because
the
inspector
would
fail
to
find
the
stolen
mail
that
respondent
had
hidden
under
the
floor
mat
of
his
car.
it
is
also
clear
i
think
from
the
facts,
although
the
court
of
appeals
says
otherwise,
that
respondent
knew
he
did
not
have
to
consent.
again,
under
the
holding
of
this
court
in
schneckloth
an
actual
concrete
warning
with
respect
to
the
right
to
withhold
consent
is
not
necessary
and
its
presence
or
absence
is
simply
a
fact
that
could
be
taken
into
account,
presumably
that
means
that
it
is
to
be
taken
into
account
realistically
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
where
an
arrested
person
is
practically
insisting
that
his
car
be
searched,
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
find
that
there
was
not
voluntary
consent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely
and
i
am
turning
to
that
next.
it
is
true
that
schneckloth
explicitly
refrained
from
passing
on
the
custodial
situation.
however,
six
courts
of
appeals
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
the
second,
fourth,
fifth,
seventh,
eighth,
and
ninth
circuits
all
have
passed
on
that
issue
and
indeed
the
court
below
in
this
case
said
that
consent
alone
just
like
the
lack
of
a
warning
of
a
right
to
withhold
consent
is
not
a
per
se
factor
that
would
be
automatically
dispositive
of
the
validity
of
the
consent,
but
custody
is
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account.
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
if
a
person
in
custody
can
give
a
valid
confession
as
miranda
recognizes
he
can,
that
a
person
in
custody
can
give
a
valid
consent
to
a
search.
of
course
if
he
has
been
taken
away
and
he
spent
six
hours
in
the
back
room
of
a
police
station,
that
would
be
a
significant
factor
in
evaluating
the
voluntariness
of
his
consent.
so
i
think
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
at
substantial
length
on
the
factor
of
custody
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
overall
reasoning
and
structure
of
the
schneckloth
decision
and
the
principles
that
underlay
it
apply
equally
to
the
factor
of
custody.
it
is
possible
to
look
at
custody
and
to
determine
the
circumstances
of
custody
and
from
that
to
make
a
decision
whether
or
not
the
consent
that
is
given
to
a
search
is
a
voluntary
consent.
and
there
is
i
think
no
need
for
per
se
rule
and
the
courts
of
appeals
seem
to
be
in
universal
agreement
on
that
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
the
record
indicates
about
15
minutes.
the
search
itself
was
about
15
minutes,
but
he
was
removed
from
the
restaurant,
arrested,
told
what
he
was
arrested
for,
searched
and
then
the
conversation
promptly
ensued.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right,
it
was
on
the
street
prompt
consent.
and
that
the
--
of
course
the
period
of
time
that
passed
would
be
significant
in
the
rothman
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
was
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
cited
by
my
opponent.
several
hours
had
passed,
during
which
repeated
requests
had
been
made
to
the
suspect
in
custody
to
permit
the
search
of
his
bag
and
he
had
refused
over
and
over
and
finally
he
was
told
that
the
officers
would
get
a
warrant,
although
in
fact
they
have
not
the
least
basis
to
get
a
warrant.
and
at
that
point,
he
said,
well,
what
the
heck,
go
ahead
and
search
it,
but
that
is
quite
a
different
case
from
what
we
have
here.
so
turning
from
the
fact
of
custody
alone
to
the
question
of
the
illegal
nature
of
the
custody
and
i
am
assuming
arguendo
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
respondent’s
custody
was
illegal,
it
is
clear
that
the
illegality
is
in
almost
all
cases
totally
irrelevant
to
the
kind
of
voluntariness
analysis
that
was
applied
in
schneckloth
for
assessing
the
validity
of
a
consent.
the
voluntariness
of
respondent's
consent
could
not
possibly
have
been
affected
by
what
he
did
not
know
to
wit
that
the
court
of
appeals
two
years
later
would
hold
that
his
arrest
was
illegal
for
lack
of
a
warrant.
since
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
arrest
could
not
have
impinged
on
his
consciousness
or
indeed
on
the
consciousness
of
the
postal
inspectors
under
circumstances
of
this
case,
unless
the
court
is
going
to
simply
throw
away
the
voluntariness
analysis,
the
illegality
cannot
play
a
role
in
that
analysis.
so
in
connection
with
the
consent
i
think
the
only
colorable
issue
that
really
exists
is
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
question
and
that
is
a
question
that
was
no
adverted
to
at
all
or
relied
upon
in
any
way
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
the
argument
is
whether
or
not
the
consent
was
voluntary
if
it
was
the
product
of
an
illegal
arrest,
part
of
the
deterrent
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
might
be
served
by
treating
the
consent
as
invalid
fruit.
we
think
such
an
argument
is
untenable
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
we
think
that
that
result
is
clear
from
this
court’s
decision
in
brown
against
illinois.
in
brown,
the
court
asked
the
question
whether
the
statements
there
obtained
by
an
illegally
arrested
individual
after
he
had
been
given
miranda
warnings,
but
during
a
period
of
illegal
detention
were
obtained
by
exploitation
of
the
illegality
of
his
arrest.
the
court
rejected
any
“but
for”
rule
that
said
simply
it
would
be
enough
for
the
defendant
to
show
that
he
might
not
have
made
the
statement
or
here
he
might
not
have
consented
had
he
not
been
arrested.
instead
it
looked
at
exploitation
of
illegality.
it
looked
at
the
behavior
of
the
officers
in
the
case,
particularly
said
the
court
at
page
13
of
the
slip
opinion,
the
purpose
and
flagrancy
of
the
official
misconduct.
in
the
present
case,
there
was
not
and
there
could
not
have
been
any
exploitation
of
the
illegality
that
existed
in
the
present
case.
the
illegality,
if
there
was
any,
was
not
that
they
have
no
right
to
arrest
him
as
such,
not
that
there
was
not
adequate
justification
for
taking
mr.
watson
into
custody,
but
that
they
did
not
possess
a
warrant.
now,
of
course
their
possession
are
non-possession
of
a
warrant
can
have
no
possible
bearing
on
whether
or
not
a
consent
would
be
given
to
search
of
the
automobile.
consequently,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
they
could
have
been
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
no
exploitation
of
an
illegality
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
consent
and
that
under
brown,
i
think
is
the
pertinent
criterion.
so
i
think
in
this
case
we
have
the
consent
as
an
independent
voluntary
act,
untainted
by
any
legality
that
there
may
have
been
in
the
arrest.
finally,
in
connection
with
the
consent
issue,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
respondent
did
not
testify
at
the
suppression
hearing.
he
never
got
up
and
said
one
word
about
the
involuntariness,
one
word
about
his
state
of
mind
in
granting
the
consent.
there
was
no
contradiction
of
the
inspector’s
version
of
the
events.
now,
unless
there
is
to
be
a
per
se
rule,
i
think
that
a
defendant
is
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time
establishing
voluntariness
without
getting
on
the
stand
and
then
of
course,
there
are
no
self-incrimination
problems
because
his
testimony
at
the
suppression
hearing
could
not
be
used
against
him
in
the
trial.
so
we
do
not
have
fifth
amendment
justification
for
not
taking
the
stand
and
i
submit
that
ordinarily,
unless
the
other
evidence
demonstrates
plainly
that
the
consent
was
involuntary
that
the
absence
of
testimony
by
a
defendant
would
be
a
very
significant
factor
in
the
voluntariness
inquiry.
so
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
reinstate
respondent’s
conviction.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
one
or
two
brief
points
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
on
the
question
of
the
basis
for
respondent’s
arrest,
inspector
barbarick
never
denied
that
he
was
arresting
for
the
other
purposes.
he
is
simply
announced
at
the
time
he
made
the
arrest
then
he
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
the
arrest
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
old
credit
card.
of
course
at
that
point,
he
had
not
yet
found
the
other
credit
cards
which
might
explain
why
he
was
basing
it
on
the
old
credit
card.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree
if
he
have
not
had
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
not
affect
whether
or
not
he
had
probable
cause,
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
even
if
he
subjectively
believed
he
was
arresting
for
the
old
credit
card,
the
existence
of
probable
cause
with
respect
to
the
additional
stolen
credit
cards
would
support
the
arrest
and
there
are
several
cases
that
hold
that
that
i
would
like
to
call
for
the
court’s
attention
in
light
of
the
argument
that
has
been
made.
in
united
states
against
martinez,
a
second
circuit
decision
465
f
2d
79
and
ramirez
against
rodriguez,
467
f
2d
822,
a
tenth
circuit
decision.
there
are
some
others,
but
the
point
is
there
that
if
the
officer
believes
he
is
arresting
for
one
offense
for
which
he
does
not
have
probable
cause,
but
in
fact
the
facts
known
to
him
give
him
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
a
different
offense,
the
arrest
is
lawful.
similarly
if
an
officer
is
proceeding
under
warrant
which
turns
out
to
be
invalid,
the
court
then
looks
to
see
whether
probable
cause
existed
for
the
arrest
and
indeed
that
was
the
analytical
approach
taken
in
the
coolidge
case
by
this
court.
now,
also
as
a
practical
matter,
the
suggestion
is
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
this
warrant
requirement
would
not
apply
because
in
most
cases
there
would
be
a
danger
of
escape
or
something
of
that
sort.
but
of
course
there
are
holdings
in
the
search
and
seizure
area
that
exigent
circumstances
at
the
moment
you
under
take
the
search
may
not
be
enough
to
support
the
search
if
you
had
an
opportunity
prior
there
to
obtain
a
warrant.
the
case
that
comes
immediately
to
mind
is
vale
against
louisiana
in
which
it
was
clear
once
vale
was
arrested
on
the
doorstep
of
his
house,
that
there
were
indeed
exigent
circumstances
for
searching
his
house.
if
the
court
said
that
could
not
justify
the
failure
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
before
going,
so
that
the
logic
of
respondent’s
principle
would
have
a
substantially
broad
impact
and
it
is
not
just
a
very
narrow,
small
category
of
cases
that
would
be
effected.
as
for
the
desirability
of
getting
the
courts
involved
in
this,
it
seems
to
me
that
runs
contrary
to
the
robinson
case
which
recognized
that
there
were
certain
principles
in
the
law
of
arrest
that
were
well
established
and
that
it
was
undesirable
to
disrupt
those
principles
and
to
introduce
a
whole
new
realm
of
litigation.
finally
on
the
false
bravado
point,
the
record
shows
that
the
search
actually
took
15
minutes
before
the
envelope
was
found,
and
certainly
it
was
not
obvious
to
mr.
watson
that
the
inspectors
would
find
the
envelope.
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you.
