we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-538,
united
states
against
watson.
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me
mr.
frey,
you
mean
to
say
they
made
the
per
se
rule,
do
you
think
they
made
a
per
se
rule
both
on
the
arrest
factor
and
on
the
consent
or
just
only
consent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
fact
of
determination
left
to
be
made
is
on
the
time,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
cases
held
that
a
warrant
must
be
obtained
simply
because
there
is
time
to
obtain
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
they
have
established
the
rule
that
if
there
is
time
to
get
a
warrant,
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
is
invalid,
is
that
not
the
holding
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
per
se
rule,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
frey.
mr.
nasatir.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
he
know
that
he
was
going
to
be
present
except
to
he
was
invited
or
an
appointment
had
been
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
did
not
know
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
statement
assumes
that
after
various
people
have
handled
the
credit
card,
the
fingerprints
of
the
first
man
would
still
be
discernible,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
very
likely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
been
handled
by
first,
the
informant
then
by
the
detectives
and
other
the
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
one
you
are
arguing
that
that
the
constitution
requires
a
policeman
to
protect
a
man
in
this
situation
from
which
you
call
his
urge
to
engage
in
false
bravado?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
--
what
is
the
basis
for
you
making
that
statement
that
he
did
not
know
about
his
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you
had
just
describe
that
a
false
bravado
a
few
minutes
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
tried
not
to
be
false,
but
perhaps
he
hoped
they
would
not
look
under
the
floor
board?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
white
will
announce
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
watson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
