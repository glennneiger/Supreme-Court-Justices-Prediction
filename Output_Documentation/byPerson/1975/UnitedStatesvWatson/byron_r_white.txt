justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
presents
questions
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
to
the
legality
of
a
warrantless
arrest
and
of
the
ensuing
search
of
an
automobile.
we
find
that
the
arrest
was
authorized
by
federal
statute
and
did
not
violate
the
constitution.
in
our
view,
the
resulting
search
was
also
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
different
view
and
on
that
basis
set
aside
a
criminal
conviction,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
powell,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court,
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
either
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
