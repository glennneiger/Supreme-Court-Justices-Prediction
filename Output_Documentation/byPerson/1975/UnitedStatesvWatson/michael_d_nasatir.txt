mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
last
part
of
petitioner’s
argument
in
this
case
i
think
states
and
clearly
states
how
the
petitioner
is
misstated
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
police
had
time
to
get
a
warrant
and
just
because
they
waited
six
days,
they
had
to
get
a
warrant
for
petitioner’s
arrest.
the
issue
in
this
particular
case
is
that
the
prosecution
failed
to
carry
its
burden
as
it
had,
as
it
did
not
produce
a
warrant,
failed
to
carry
its
burden
on
these
particular
facts
and
in
these
particular
circumstances.
of
course
it
failed
to
carry
its
burden
on
the
two
crucial
points.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
excuse
me.
just
in
the
district
court
at
the
hearing.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
i
mean
just
in
the
district
court,
in
the
district
court
at
the
hearing,
the
prosecution
had
the
burden
of
proving
(1)
that
the
arrest
was
legal
and
proper
and
was
made
with
probable
cause
since
they
did
not
have
an
arrest
warrant
and
(2)
that
the
consent
to
search
was
voluntary
because
the
respondent
was
in
custody
at
the
time.
so,
on
each
of
those
two
points,
they
failed
to
carry
their
burden.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
the
district
court
did
not
suppress
the
evidence.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct.
of
course
the
district
court
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
this
schneckloth
decision
at
that
time.
it
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
brown
decision
at
that
time
and
it
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
some
of
the
later
cases
which
has
clarified
this
court’s
thinking
on
that
very
issue.
and
i
think
the
district
court
erroneously
and
i
think
even
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
considered
that
this
was
a
probable
cause
arrest
and
that
the
probable
cause
was
sufficient.
but
of
course,
that
was
decided
against
us
and
although
we
asserted
as
alternative
ground
is
not
our
primary
issues.
what
i
would
like
to
make
clear
to
the
court
today
is,
what
is
the
issue
in
this
case
and
what
was
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
ninth
circuit?
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
establish
a
per
se
rule
as
to
all
situations
that
an
arrest
warrant.
if
you
have
time
to
get
one,
you
must
obtain
one
or
the
police
must
obtain
one.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
said
in
this
particular
situation
where
inspector
barbarick
waited
six
days,
where
there
was
time
to
get
a
warrant
and
where
the
prosecution
in
caring
its
burden
could
not
point
to
one
exigent
circumstance
where
a
warrant
would
be
excused
and
in
this
particular
case
a
warrant
is
not
excused
and
a
warrant
was
necessary.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
it
might
have
been
exigent
at
the
time
he
was
committing
the
last
crime
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct.
but
that
of
course
was
later
and
i
think
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
do
not
see
any
significance
because
the
officer
at
the
scene
did
not
see
any
significance
in
that.
obviously,
what
happened
here
is
the
officer
at
the
scene
did
not
trust
his
own
informant,
especially
when
he
found
out
after
he
searched
him.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
he
did
not
see
a
crime
committed
in
his
presence.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
all
he
saw
was
–-
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
all
he
saw
in
his
presence
was
a
cigarette
being
lighted.
as
soon
as
he
started
to
validate
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
the
respondent
was
in
possession
of
stolen
credit
cards
which
is
a
crime.
but
your
honor,
as
soon
as
he
patted
down
the
respondent,
he
found
out
that
they
did
not
have
credit
cards.
and
obviously,
since
he
said
that
the
only
reason
he
arrested
the
respondent
was
because
of
that
lit
cigarette,
i
mean,
was
because
of
the
prior
crime
he
did
not
even
trust
the
lit
cigarette.
i
think
this
is
important.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
the
credit
cards
were
in
his
car.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
the
court
found
they
were
in
his
constructive
possession,
yes
your
honor.
now,
what
inspector
barbarick
and
this
i
think
is
crucial,
when
he
saw
that
lit
cigarette,
he
did
not
trust
that
lit
cigarette.
he
did
not
feel
that
there
was
new
crime
being
committed
or
he
would
have
arrested
on
probable
cause
for
that
new
crime
which
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
do.
there
is
a
crime
being
committed
in
his
presence.
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
of
escape,
but
what
he
did
he
relied
on
a
crime
that
was
committed
six
days
ago
and
i
think
this
issue
is
important
because
of
the
straw
man
which
the
solicitor
general
has
set
up
in
this
case.
he
says
all
the
deleterious
effects
that
a
warrant
would
have,
he
says
that
a
warrant
would
encourage
an
investigation,
a
further
investigation
that
no
warrant
would
leave
the
police
free
to
conduct
the
further
investigation
and
to
collect
more
evidence
to
be
sure
that
they
had
the
right
men,
that
they
could
collect
more
information
and
be
sure
that
they
could
collaborate
the
informant,
that
they
could
collect
more
information
so
that
they
could
clear
innocent
people.
but
on
these
facts,
you
can
see
what
human
nature
is
and
i
think
you
can
see
the
reason
why
the
fourth
amendment
and
all
case
law
has
required
warrants
in
these
situations
where
a
policeman
has
a
time
to
reflect.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
well,
i
can
say
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
the
cases
from
this
court
are
the
rabinowitz
case,
the
trupiano
case,
the
brown
case,
all
the
cases
which
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
absolutely
searches,
but
are
we
going
to
say
that
a
search
of
items
or
objects
are
more
of
an
intrusion
on
a
person’s
privacy
which
i
think
anyone
will
admit
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect,
are
they
more
of
an
intrusion
on
a
person’s
privacy
and
a
seizure
that
person
himself.
when
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
a
warrant
is
required
where
there
are
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
your
honor,
there
are
no
cases
which
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
all
of
the
cases
hold
that
in
a
search
and
seizure
situation
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
well,
your
honor,
an
arrest
is
a
seizure
of
a
person.
that
is
all
it
is.
that
is
the
only
thing
an
arrest
is.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
there
have
been
the
probable
cause
where
there
exigent
circumstances,
certainly
and
in
every
case
where
they
have
held
that
an
arrest
is
proper,
there
have
been
exigent
circumstances.
now,
in
a
couple
of
cases
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
in
trupiano
for
example.
the
officers
saw
an
ongoing
crime,
committed
exactly
in
their
presence
which
is
the
situation
that
mr.
justice
marshall
spoke
about,
a
crime
being
committed
in
their
presence
which
they
had
the
perfect
right
to
stop
and
to
arrest
the
person
without
a
warrant
even
when
he
was
on
his
premises.
they
look
through
that
window;
they
saw
the
man
operating
a
still.
they
had
a
search
warrant
in
that
case
and
they
presented
the
facts
as
to
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
exactly
your
honor
and
mr.
justice
white,
in
a
dissent
and
i
do
not
have
the
case
to
cite
to
you
at
the
present
time,
but
in
a
dissent,
he
says
that
really
it
has
been
assumed
that
arrest
have
been
made
with
exigent
circumstances
because
in
actuality
this
is
an
unusual
case.
in
most
cases,
in
arrest
situation,
there
are
exigent
circumstances
which
exist.
exigent
circumstances
apply
to
movable
objects
and
what
is
more
movable
than
a
human
being.
but
in
this
case
there
was
not
a
movable
human
being.
in
this
case,
the
officer
knew
he
could
get
a
hold
of
mr.
watson.
he
in
fact
set
up
a
meeting
where
he
knew
mr.
watson
would
show
up
and
mr.
watson
did.
he
had
control
over
mr.
watson.
he
did
not
rely
upon
a
crime
that
was
being
committed
in
his
presence.
he
relied
upon
facts
that
occurred
six
days
prior
to
this.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
well,
certainly
he
did
not
know
but
obviously
when
mr.
watson
showed
up
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
he
had
the
feeling
and
when
mr.
watson
showed
up,
his
feeling
was
confirmed.
there
was
no
danger
of
mr.
watson
escaping.
you
see
your
honor,
what
has
happened
in
this
case
and
in
this
case
alone
is
the
prosecution
just
failed
to
carry
its
burden.
if
they
had
asked
mr.
barbarick
or
mr.
barbarick
had
really
felt
that
he
was
arresting
for
an
ongoing
crime,
he
could
have
said
so.
if
mr.
barbarick
had
felt
that
there
was
danger
of
escape
of
mr.
watson,
he
could
have
said
so.
if
mr.
barbarick
had
felt
that
he
was
protecting
the
safety
of
property
or
other
persons,
and
he
had
to
do
that
by
arresting
mr.
watson,
he
could
have
said
so.
he
never
said
so.
what
he
did
say
was
he
arrested
for
a
crime
that
was
six
days
old.
what
he
did
not
do
are
all
of
the
things
that
the
solicitor
general
says
an
investigator
will
do
if
he
is
given
the
time
to
reflect.
he
did
not
check
out
his
informant.
he
did
not
look
for
fingerprints
on
the
credit
card.
he
did
not
look
for
the
innocence
of
mr.
watson.
he
did
not
try
any
other
investigative
techniques.
he
sat
back
and
tried
to
set
up
a
situation
where
he
caught
mr.
watson
“dirty”
with
other
credit
cards.
but
then
when
he
saw
the
signal
from
his
own
informant,
obviously
he
did
not
trust
that
and
relied
upon
a
situation
which
was
six
days
old.
we
are
not
talking
about
time
in
this
case,
time
only,
but
we
are
talking
about
is
an
opportunity
to
obtain
a
warrant
without
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
would
not
concede
that
there
would
be
probable
cause
under
that
situation
your
honor,
but
i
would
concede
that
that
would
be
a
ground,
that
would
be
an
exigent
circumstance
if
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
the
only
problem
is
he
did
not
rely
on
his
informant.
he
relied
upon
a
situation
which
was
days
old.
now,
he
could
have
said
he
thought
mr.
watson
was
going
to
escape,
but
he
did
not.
obviously,
he
did
not
think
so
or
he
would
have
said
so
and
he
could
have
said
any
of
the
other
things,
but
obviously
he
did
not
think
so.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
we
want
to
involve
the
judiciary
and
magistrates
in
our
machinery
for
search
and
seizure.
if
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
in
the
decisions
that
i
have
read
in
this
court,
i
think
your
honor
that
every
justice
sitting
on
the
court
have
said
that
we
want
to
encourage
warrants
and
we
want
to
encourage
involvement
of
the
judiciary
in
arrest
situations.
we
want
to
interpose
a
magistrate's
detached
opinion
between
the
officer
who
is
actively
involved
in
forwarding
out
crime
and
whose
ego
and
everything
in
his
personality
is
involved,
we
want
to
interpose
a
neutral
detached
magistrate
to
help
him
out
to
see
if
he
has
probable
cause,
to
confirm
probable
cause
and
issue
a
legal
process
so
that
a
person
can
be
arrested.
in
many
arrest
situations
and
the
reason
why
this
litigation
has
not
reached
this
court
is
because
usually
in
an
arrest
situation,
it
is
an
easy
burden
for
the
prosecution
to
carry.
and
as
mr.
justice
white
said
in
the
dissent
i
spoke
about.
it
has
not
been
litigated
because
people
assume
exigent
circumstances
in
most
arrests
situations.
but
you
have
here
are
no
exigent
circumstances.
and
what
you
have
here
is
this
is
maybe
the
one
case
where
you
are
harking
back
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
you
say
that
the
seizure
of
a
person
is
more
important
or
at
least
just
as
important
as
the
seizure
of
an
object.
you
see,
coolidge
would
mean
if
we
would
not
require
a
warrant
to
arrest
a
body,
a
person,
to
deprive
a
person
of
his
liberty,
we
could
say,
well,
you
cannot
seize
the
car
in
coolidge
because
there
is
no
warrant,
but
you
sure
could
seize
the
driver
if
you
are
sitting
behind
the
wheel
which
seems
to
me
in
congruous
and
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
ever
meant
to
differentiate
between
searches
and
seizures.
and
why,
we
must
ask
ourselves,
does
the
solicitor
general
play
so
much
emphasis
on
an
arrest
on
private
property?
once
again,
do
we
extort
private
property
or
possessions
over
the
actual
person,
over
the
actual
liberty
of
the
human
being?
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
right
and
the
only
reason
that
it
was
deemed
important
in
coolidge
and
the
only
reason
private
property
is
deemed
important
in
any
situation
as
the
katz
case
makes
clear
your
honor
is
because
of
the
interest
that
people
have
in
their
property
and
in
that
privacy.
if
nobody
was
involved,
if
no
person
was
involved
in
that
private
property
situation
in
coolidge,
we
would
not
care
about
it.
we
would
not
be
worried
about
it.
so
when
the
person
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
if
no
one
owned
that
car,
like
an
abandoned
car,
if
it
was
an
abandoned
car,
if
no
one
had
an
interest
in
it,
if
no
one
owned
that
home
or
lived
there.
a
home
is
only
a
shell
around
the
body.
katz
made
clear
that
what
you
are
talking
about,
when
you
are
talking
about
the
protection
of
privacy
and
property
is
the
person
who
owns
it,
who
has
an
interest
in
it.
those
are
our
reasons
for
standing.
those
are
our
reasons
for
the
protection
of
the
judiciary
in
these
situations
at
all
is
that
person.
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
why
it
has
not
been
brought
up
in
many
cases
before
this
court
is
because
usually
the
police
have
an
excuse
for
justification,
for
arresting
a
person
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
well,
really
the
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
the
only
authority
that
i
have
is
mr.
chief
justice
white’s
statement
that
this
has
never
been
litigated
because
people
are
not
litigated
much
because
people
assume
that
there
are
exigent
circumstances
and
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
certainly
that
is
the
usual
rule,
but
there
must
be
exigent
circumstances.
the
constitution
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
in
carroll
versus
united
states?
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
certainly
in
carroll
versus
united
states,
but
you
will
also
find
exigent
circumstances
in
carroll
versus
united
states.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
it
is
not
in
that
phrase,
but
that
is
what
carroll
is
all
about,
the
moving
vehicle.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
and
that
is
what
carroll
has
been
cited
for
in
many,
many
years,
it
is
the
moving
vehicle
in
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
has
been
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
but
the
case
did
and
the
usual
case
has
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
the
usual
facts
do.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
not
where
a
man
is
committing
a
crime
in
the
officers
presence.
obviously
the
officer
has
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
he
was.
that
is
what
the
informant
signal
meant
to
the
officer.
that
is
correct,
but
the
officer
did
not
believe
it
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
he
did
not
move
on
that.
what
he
moved
on
was
the
situation
that
arose
six
days
earlier.
the
past
crime.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
crime
was
possession
of
stolen
mail
also,
but
that
was
a
different
crime.
what
he
tried
to
do
was
set
up
a
new
crime.
what
happened
was
he
was
not
sure.
if
you
allow
this
type
of
situation
your
honor,
you
allow
a
situation
which
and
what
want
to
get
to
now
is
the
consent
where
a
person
can
be
arrested
and
his
consent
can
be
obtained.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
and
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it
your
honor.
your
honor,
in
this
type
of
situation
since
the
officer
did
not
find
the
credit
cards
on
the
person
or
did
not
believe
his
informant’s
signal,
obviously,
what
he
wanted
to
do
is
set
up
a
situation
where
he
could
arrest
mr.
watson
with
the
credit
cards
on
him.
he
patted
him
down.
he
searched
him.
he
did
no
have
the
credit
cards.
then
he
advised
him
of
his
miranda
rights
immediately
after
taking
him
out
of
a
restaurant
and
the
reason
he
took
him
out
i
think
is
important,
that
things
were
getting
excited
in
the
restaurant
and
things
were
getting
confused
in
the
restaurant.
it
was
confusing,
exciting
situation.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
because
he
did
not
rely
on
it.
he
relied
on
the
information
that
he
had
received
six
days
earlier.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
not
the
arrest
your
honor.
the
arrest
was
triggered
because
of
the
past
crime
that
the
officer
had.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
what
the
officer
said
on
the
stand.
that
is
what
the
prosecution
in
attempting
to
carry
their
burden
in
this
case
said.
this
comes
from
the
prosecution’s
evidence
not
those
of
--
that
of
the
respondent.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
triggered
the
approach
your
honor
which
triggered
the
arrest
according
to
the
officer’s
own
testimony
was
that
prior
crime
and
not
the
signal
and
i
think
there
is
distinction
between
the
approach
of
the
person
and
the
arrest.
now
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
the
signal
only
pointed
in
time
the
approach
of
the
officer,
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
i
think
relevant
to
this
issue
by
the
way
is
the
fact
that
the
officer
in
the
six
days
never
attempted
to
collaborate
his
informant
in
any
way.
he
had
a
handwriting
exemplary
of
my
client,
the
respondent.
he
had
fingerprint
exemplary
of
my
client.
he
never
corroborated
that
his
fingerprints
were
on
the
credit
card
or
that
his
handwriting
was
on
the
list
that
was
given
to
him
by
his
informant.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
yes,
it
does.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
it
is
possible
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
well,
your
honor,
in
careful
police
work,
the
detective
would
have
not
handled
it
of
course.
so,
it
would
have
just
been
handled,
if
the
informant’s
facts
were
true,
it
would
have
just
been
handle
by
the
informant
and
the
respondent
so
that
the
fingerprints
still
would
have
been
there,
if
inspector
barbarick
had
used
those
six
days
to
check
those
facts
up.
in
the
consent
situation,
he
was
placed
in
custody,
handcuffs
were
placed
upon
him,
he
was
given
his
miranda
rights.
his
miranda
rights
of
course
do
nothing
to
vindicate
his
fourth
amendment
rights
as
was
made
clear
by
brown.
so
the
first
analysis
i
think
is
if
you
hold
that
arrest
was
illegal
because
of
the
failure
to
obtain
a
warrant
in
this
unusual
circumstances
or
because
the
prosecution
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of
showing
exigent
circumstances
to
excuse
that
warrant,
then
it
is
certain
under
these
facts
that
this
was
a
fruit
of
that
illegal
arrest.
there
was
very
few
minutes
in
between
the
arrest
and
the
consent.
there
was
clearly
no
warning
that
would
attenuate
the
taint
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
my
client
said
yes.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
oh!
that
is
consent
your
honor,
but
is
a
voluntary
consent.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
not
to
my
mind,
not
in
this
situation
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
what
you
would
need
for
consent
is
the
specific
warning.
now,
mr.
watson
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
was
the
warning
about
what
would
be
done
with
it,
but
there
was
no
warning
of
his
right
to
refuse.
the
fact
of
it
being
used
against
him
does
not
indicate
that
he
had
a
right
to
refuse
and
it
has
always
intrigued
me
in
the
miranda
situation
that
you
tell
a
person
that
he
does
not
have
to
talk
to
you
and
then
you
immediately
start
asking
him
questions.
now,
what
is
he
to
assume
for
that?
is
it
to
assume
that
he
has
the
right
to
refuse
from
the
fact
you
tell
him
you
do
not
have
to
talk
to
me
and
you
immediately
ask
him
questions?
and
also
your
honor,
i
think
you
should
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
but
he
never
said
you
have
the
right
under
the
constitution
not
to
let
me
go
in
there.
i
will
use
it
against
you,
but
you
have
the
right
not
to
let
me
go
in
there.
if
inspector
barbarick
really
wanted
to
be
fair
in
this
case
to
mr.
watson
and
really
wanted
–-
your
dissent
in
brown
your
honor,
you
stated
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no
question
about
it,
but
i
think
you
correctly
stated
that
–-
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
no.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
i
am
just
talking
in
favor
of
a
principle
that
an
informed
choice
must
necessarily
be
made
by
a
person
who
is
aware
of
his
choices.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
think
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no,
because
i
think
telling
a
man
that
you
are
going
to
use
it
is
different
from
telling
him
that
he
has
the
right
to
prevent
you
from
getting
it
in
the
first
place
and
i
think
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
that
your
honor.
but
there
are
three
analyses
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
case
below
in
their
totality
of
–-
first,
it
can
be
analyzed
under
the
fruits
doctrine
as
stated
in
brown
to
protect
the
fourth
amendment
rights.
but
to
protect
the
fifth
amendment
rights
involved
in
this
case,
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
consider
both
sides
of
the
coin
which
is
i
think
the
correct
analysis
under
this
court’s
opinion.
they
considered
the
effect
of
the
possible
coercion
on
the
respondent.
they
also
considered
the
police
conduct.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
the
right
to
due
process.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
think
it
is
involved
too.
it
is
a
custody
situation.
it
is
a
situation
where
a
person,
where
the
police
had
in
effect
extracted
the
words
i
consent
from
my
client.
under
that
situation,
it
is
a
fifth
amendment
analysis.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
under
that
analysis
yes.
and
also
under
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
think
under
the
katz
decision,
your
honor
where
they
say
that
an
intercepted
conversation
is
the
same
an
intercepted
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
case.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
it
incriminates
himself,
but
the
main
argument
of
course
is
the
schneckloth
volunteer
in
this
argument.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
because
it
is
a
response
where
he
does
not
have
to
give
one,
leading
to,
tending
to
incriminate
himself.
leading
to
evidence
that
will
incriminate
himself
by
his
own
statement.
when
he
says
i
consent,
that
allows
the
officer
to
get
evidence
from
the
automobile.
but
also
your
honor,
obviously,
the
fifth
amendment
analysis
goes
to
the
voluntariness
question.
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
saying
is
that
you
cannot
ignore
the
situation
which
has
brought
about
the
custody
in
determining
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
when
you
are
looking
at
the
voluntariness
question
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
not
ignoring
the
situation
which
brought
about
the
custody,
they
took
a
look
at
the
police
conduct
as
well
as
it
its
effect
on
that
person.
and
under
that
analysis,
you
can
apply
to
the
facts
of
any
case
and
certainly
it
is
not
a
per
se
rule
as
to
consent.
it
allows
the
court
and
courts
in
general
to
look
at
all
the
circumstances,
including
the
situation
which
brought
about
the
consent
as
well
as
that
situation’s
effect
on
the
person
and
its
voluntariness.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
mr.
justice
blackmun,
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
am
sorry.
my
client
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
one
minute
and
was
arrested
in
handcuff
the
next.
he
was
then
given
rights
which
related
to
his
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
and
then
immediately
asked
the
question
that
lead
to
his
incrimination.
under
those
circumstances,
certainly
human-beings
react
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
and
one
of
those
ways
might
be
false
bravado.
certainly
the
way,
the
human-beings
react
is
not
to
look
at
the
officer
in
the
eye
in
stony
silence
which
would
be
rude,
which
would
be
in
congress
with
a
question.
that
is
not
the
way
human
beings
usually
react.
sometimes
some
of
them
react
as
did
mr.
watson
here
obviously
with
false
bravado
rather
than
with
informed
awareness
of
his
right
to
refuse
to
consent.
if
it
had
been
certainly
a
lawyer
under
arrest
or
someone
who
was
informed
of
his
rights,
he
would
have
said
i
refuse
to
consent
to
a
search
of
my
automobile.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
only
to
adequately
inform
him
of
his
choices
your
honor.
only
to
make
sure
that
he
is
aware
of
what
his
choices
are
and
that
one
of
those
choices
would
result
in
his
keeping
the
officer
out
of
that
automobile.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
he
certainly
had
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no
sir.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
yes,
in
response
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
obviously,
he
did
not
know
about
his
right
to
consent.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
because
he
allowed
the
officer
to
go
into
a
car
where
he
knew
incriminating
evidence
was
under
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
it
was
false
bravado.
obviously
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
a
possibility
your
honor,
no
question
about
it.
i
think
this
case
shows
the
propriety
and
the
reasons
why
warrant
should
be
required.
without
requiring
warrants
in
a
case
such
as
this,
there
will
never
be
an
incentive
for
the
police
to
get
warrants
in
an
arrest
situation
where
warrants
are
required.
respondent
admits
that
vast
majority
of
arrest
situations;
a
warrant
will
not
be
required
because
exigent
circumstances
are
present.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
in
a
public
place.
no
question
about
it
and
i
admit
that,
but
not
in
this
case.
not
in
this
case
where
the
man
waited
six
days
and
showed
why
warrant
should
be
required
because
he
did
intend
to
try
to
corroborate
his
informant.
he
did
not
investigate
further.
he
did
not
investigate
to
clear
my
client.
he
did
not
do
any
thing
except
try
and
set
up
a
situation
to
get
a
new
crime
which
he
did
not
get
in
his
own
mind
and
he
arrested
for
the
old
crime.
under
those
circumstances
the
prosecution
in
this
case
did
not
carry
its
burden
on
either
issue.
