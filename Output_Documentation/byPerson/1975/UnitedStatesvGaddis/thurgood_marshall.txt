justice
thurgood
marshall
in
jones
the
charge
being
--
it
is
either
the
grand
jury
or
the
prosecutor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
in
this
case
if
he
had
been
found
not
guilty
of
possession
in
this
very
period?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
have
been
an
awful
silly
verdict,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
see
why
we
have
to
make
rules
to
let
the
prosecutor
try
anyway
he
wants
to
try,
i
think
he
should
follow
the
rules?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
decides
to
try
the
man
on
possession,
he
is
stuck
with
it.
if
he
decides
to
try
him
on
robbery,
he
is
stuck
with
it;
he
can
have
it
both
ways.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
not
brought
it
back
by
the
prosecution,
putting
all
four
of
these
together?
when
it
gets
to
the
jury,
doesn’t
he
have
a
duty
of
deciding
which
one
should
go
to
the
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
is
required
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
isn’t
he
required
to
read
these
two
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
only
people
guilty
in
the
robbery
are
those
inside
the
bank?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
do
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
she
didn’t
shoot
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
were
the
men
in
this
case
charged
with
assault?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
was
guilty
of
that
then,
wasn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
have
lost
your
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
with
the
instructions
that
the
court
acquit
on
the
possession
charged.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
more
do
you
want
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
a
new
trial.
you
were
satisfied
with
the
trial
at
the
time
of
the
verdict
weren’t
you?
except
the
verdict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
cite
the
failure
to
give
the
either-or
instruction
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
so
far
that
was
concerned
you
were
satisfied.
