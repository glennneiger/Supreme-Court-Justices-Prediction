justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
under
2255
then,
they
later
come
and
attack
the
main
sentence—
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
had
thought
you
could
submit
inconsistent
verdicts
to
the
jury
for
the
last
200
years
that
notions
to
the
contrary
went
out
with
blackstone.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
failure
to
object
to
the
instructions
is
open
to
the
government
to
argue
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
you
not
object
to
the
failure
to
give
the
instruction
that
you
now
say
should
have
been
given?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn’t
that
the
whole
point
of
objections
in
the
trial
court
is
so
that
the
district
judge
who
maybe
on
the
point
of
erring
can
have
his
attention
called,
and
if
you
fail
to
object,
you
are
presumably
barred
from
raising
that
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
was
this
plain
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
why
did
they
decide
it
was
plain
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
is
true
of
almost
any
jury
exceptions.
if
you
say
this
is
plain
error,
you
are
going
to
end
up
saying
that
counsel
never
has
to
object
because
you
can
always
call
it
plain
error.
the
district
judge
could
have
shaped
his
instructions
to
conform
to
your
objection,
you
called
his
attention
to
the
milanovich
case,
i
would
think?
frankly,
that
you
didn’t
know
of
it
and
he
didn’t
know
of
it.
i
would
think
it
is
counsel's
job
to
call
his
attention
to
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
one
can
reject
that
is
take
it
without
necessarily
feeling
that
the
thing
ought
to
be
sent
back
for
a
new
trial
at
all.
do
you
think
it
makes
much
sense
in
the
administration
of
justice
when
a
jury
has
found
these
clients
of
yours
guilty
on
two
separate
counts,
to
simply
say
they
are
entitled
to
a
new
trial
on
both
counts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
all
that
jury
did
was
found
facts,
that
seems
to
me
that
heflin
and
milanovich
do
not
say
anything
more
that,
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
fact.
these
two
offenses
can't
subsist
side
by
side.
and
so
your
client
is
getting
a
good
deal,
if
he
is
let
off
to
hook
on
either
one
of
them,
that
is
what
it
boils
down
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
sounds
like
a
good
part
of
georgia
to
stay
away
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
the
court
does
not
agree
with
you
that
a
new
trial
is
required,
but
the
that
the
defendant
may
be
sentenced
for
only
one
of
the
crimes,
do
you
make
a
separate
point
that
there
must
be
re-sentencing
here
or
just
cancellation
of
the
one
sentence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
the
--the
sentence
was,
the
sentences
were
separate
on
each
count?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
did
say,
he
did
sentence
separately
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about
the
law.
that
is
what
instructions
do,
they
state
the
law?
