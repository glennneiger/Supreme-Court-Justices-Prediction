mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
which
reversed
respondents’
convictions
for
aggravated
bank
robbery
and
possession
of
the
proceeds
thereof,
in
violation
of
various
subsections
of
18
u.s.c
2113
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
the
facts
maybe
stated
simply,
respondents
along
with
co-defendant
davis
robbed
the
bank.
in
the
course
of
doing
so,
they
assaulted
several
people
in
the
bank,
and
in
departing
the
scene
of
the
robbery
both
respondents
shot
at
and
one
at
least
hit
a
police
officer
who
tried
to
intercept
them.
after
getting
away
with
their
loot,
respondents
and
davis
split
up
the
money.
for
this
event,
respondents
were
indicted
in
an
eight
count
indictment.
seven
of
these
counts
charged
robbery
and
assault
and
unlawful
entry
offenses
under
subsections
(a)
and
(d)
of
section
2113.
the
eight
count,
thanks
to
which
we
are
here
today,
charged
respondents
with
possession
of
the
proceeds
of
the
robbery
in
violation
of
subsection
(c).
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
under
instructions
that
allow
the
jury
to
convict
on
all
eight
counts.
the
jury
was
not
told
that
the
possession
count
was
inconsistent
with
all
the
others,
or
that
it
could
not
return
a
guilty
verdict
on
that
count,
unless
it
refused
to
convict
on
the
robbery
and
assault
counts.
the
defense
made
no
objection
to
the
failure
to
give
this
what
i
will
call
here
after
in
the
argument
an
either-or
instruction.
the
jury
convicted
respondents
on
all
counts.
and
imposing
sentence
the
district
court
stated
that,
this
is
set
forth
at
page
six
of
our
brief,
the
court
realizes
the
25
years
is
the
maximum.
and
the
cases
say
that
there
is
a
merger
of
all
of
these
offenses.
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
the
legality
of
that
sentence,
that
is
the
court’s
intention,
and
the
judgment
indicated
maximum
sentences
on
each
of
the
counts
all
that
are
concurrent.
the
maximum
sentence
for
the
(c)
count
would
be
ten
years,
had
the
defendants
been
convicted
only
on
that
count,
however
in
effect
they
received
the
25
year
sentence.
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
relying
upon
this
court’s
decisions
in
heflin
and
milanovich
reversed.
held
that
the
failure
to
give
the
either-or
instruction
was
plain
error
and
the
proper
remedy
for
this
error
was
a
remand
for
new
trial.
it
explains
this
as
follows,
and
this
is
at
page
18
of
our
petition,
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
what
verdict
to
properly
instruct
the
jury
would
have
returned
in
this
case,
and
for
a
reviewing
court
to
speculate
on
that
subject
would
be
to
usurp
the
functions
of
both
the
jury
and
the
sentencing
judge,
citing
milanovich.
since
the
jury’s
verdict
was
inherently
inconsistent,
the
proper
remedy
is
to
remand
for
a
new
trial.
before
beginning
the
argument
portion,
i
would
like
to
make
one
correction
in
our
brief
at
page
17,
the
brief
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
brief
on
the
merits,
yes.
i
do
not
believe,
we
had
a
supplement
to
the
petition,
but
we
do
not
have
a
supplemental
brief
or
reply
brief.
we
only
have
one
brief
on
the
merits.
page
17
in
footnote
4
in
the
second
paragraph,
there
is
a
citation
to
a
case
called
ethridge
versus
united
states.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
page
17,
footnote
4,
the
second
paragraph
ceg(ph).
that
ethridge
case
is
mis-cited,
it
did
not
involve
equal
concurrent
sentences,
and
that
citation
should
be
deleted
and
i
suppose,
the
eg(ph)
signals
should
also
be
deleted
because
i
can
not
replace
it
with
any
other
cases.
it
is
not
pertinent
to
the
main
body
of
my
argument
but
i
did
not
want
to
--—i
believe
it
does.
we
have
presented
basically
three
arguments
to
the
court
in
our
brief.
first
that
the
milanovich
decision
is
distinguishable
on
these
facts.
second,
that
the
either-or
instruction
in
the
new
trial
remedy
dictated
by
milanovich
were
incorrect
and
that
the
case
should
be
overruled.
and
thirdly,
failing
those
arguments
that
any
retrial
that
might
take
place
in
this
case,
should
be
limited
to
a
selection
by
the
jury
between
the
possession
and
the
theft
offenses,
that
it
should
not
detail
a
retrial
of
guilt
or
innocence.
we
have
not
argued
although,
it
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
is
a
point
that
may
perhaps
be
kept
in
mind,
the
plain
error
issue,
milanovich
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
it
was
plain
error
because
there
was
an
objection
in
milanovich.
here
there
was
no
objection
and
presumably,
if
the
either-or
instruction
was
correct
then
we
hope
the
court
will
hold
that
no
such
instruction
ought
to
be
given.
but
if
it
should
be
given,
had
defense
council
pointed
out
to
the
court,
the
error
could
have
been
rectified
at
that
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
do
not
that
is
correct.
what
we
do
agree
with,
we
do
not
dispute
heflin,
and
what
we
do
agree
with
is
that
there
could
be
no
accumulation
or
pyramiding
of
punishments.
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
whether
they
can
be
convicted,
i
think
that
is
not
in
a
sense
an
important
question,
so
long
as
they
are
not
cumulatively
punished.
we
would
have
no
objection
to
a
rule
which
require
the
vacation
of
a
possession--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
we
would
have
had
no
objection,
because
on
the
facts
of
all—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
i
think
there
was
simply
no
independent
basis
for
convicting
them
of
possession
that
would
be
completely
irrational,
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
we
would
distinguish
milanovich
from
this
case,
because
in
milanovich
there
were
separate
evidence
of
a
separate
receipt
transaction.however
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
the
courts
of
appeals
in
applying
milanovich
have
rather
consistently
taken,
extracted
from
milanovich
the
principle
that
the
two
offenses
being
inconsistent
in
law,
although
of
course
they
are
not
inconsistent
in
fact,
this
either-or
instruction
must
be
given
to
the
jury.
normally,
i
believe
it
is
important
to
submit
both
counts
to
the
jury.
now
on
the
facts
of
this
case
where
there
was
absolutely
no
independent
evidence
of
possession,
i
think
it
would
have
been
quite
proper
for
the
district
court
simply
not
to
instruct
the
jury
on
possession.
normally,
and
i
might
mention
that
the
court
has
before
it
two
petitions,
which
i
guess,
it
is
holding
for
the
time
being
in
cases
that
raise
related
facets
of
this
problem.
one
is
a
case
called
united
states
against
sellers
out
of
the
fourth
circuit.
now
sellers
was
halfway
between
the
facts
of
the
present
case
and
the
facts
of
milanovich
and
that,
or
little
closer
to
milanovich
i
would
say,
in
sellers
he
was
found
with
the
loot
sometime
later.
so
that
there
was
independent
evidence
of
possession,
that
would
have
been
logically
possible
for
the
jury
to
convict
the
possession
only
and
not
of
robbery.
that
case
might
more
squarely
present
the
problem
about
which
we
are
concerned.
there
also
is
a
case
called
phillips,
also
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
into
which
we
have
petitioned.
and
there
three
of
the
judges
in
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
it
was
a
defense
to
a
possession
charged
to
prove
that
you
were
the
robber.
that
also
is
to
us
a
wooden
and
improper
application
of
the
principles
that
underlie
heflin.
i
have
mentioned
those
cases
just
to
keep
in
mind
that
there
is
a
broad
spectrum
of
factual
variance
that
can
arise.
now
certainly
in
this
case
we
have
argued
that
these
--
on
the
facts
where
all
the
evidence
points
to
robbery
where
there
is
no
independent
evidence
of
possession.
at
least
in
that
case,
there
is
no
basis
for
ordering
a
new
trial
and
at
most
it
would
simply
be
logical
to
vacate
the
possession,
conviction
and
the
concurrent
sentence
on
that
point.
now,
i
will
say
that
respondents
have
argued
that
this
case
is
not
distinguishable
from
milanovich,
and
their
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
one
of
the
respondents,
the
evidence
suggests
that
it
was
respondent
gaddis
who
was
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car
and
not
an
actual
entrant
into
the
bank
during
the
robbery.
the
argument
then
is
that
he
is
similarly
situated
to
mrs.
milanovich
because
he
was
not
a
principle
that
is
he
did
not
take
the
money
out
of
the
bank
drawers.
that
argument
would
have
a
little
more
merit
where
it
not
for
the
fact
that
he
was
a
principal
in
one
of
the
assaults
involved
in
this
case
that
is
that
it
is
he
who
shot
officer
cody
according
to
the
evidence.
and
so
that,
i
think
creates
some
difficulty
in
analogizing
his
situation
to
that
of
mrs.
milanovich.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
a
theft,
not
robbery,
yes
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
yes.
well
it
is
true
that
the
evidence
was
far
more
separated
than
here,
but
logically
one
could
perhaps
suggests
that
after
all
the
government’s
witness
was
co-robber,
davis
and
his
testimony
was
that,
that
gaddis
had
waited
outside
in
the
getaway
car
and
that
after
they
had
made
their
getaway
they
had
divided
the
loot.
logically,
i
suppose
one
could
argue
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
an
empirical
possibility
on
this
record
that
the
jury
could
have
disbelieved
that
gaddis
--
portion
of
his
testimony,
that
gaddis
was
involved
in
the
robbery
but
believed
the
portion
that
he
divided
the
proceeds.
you
shake
your
head
justice
stewart,
i
think
it
is
obviously—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
they
have
done,
they
have
done
very
strange
things.
i
do,
we
do
submit
that
the
cases
are
distinguishable
but
i
also
submit
that
at
the
heart
of
this
whole
problem
is
the
either-or
instruction
that
this
court
indicated
in
the
milanovich
case
was
required.
and
i
believe
that
it
is
our
submission
to
the
court
that
that
instruction
has
been
the
source
of
considerable
problems
in
the
administration
of
the
bank
robbery
act,
and
that
it
is
not
justified
upon
close
analysis.
and
that
this
court
ought
now
to
indicate
that
the
either-or
instruction
is
improper
and
ought
not
to
be
given
in
the
future.
the
first
defect
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
by
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
or
even
on
subsequent
attack
later
on
that
would
be
an
illegal
sentence
under
heflin,
yes
but
that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
agree
justice
stewart—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
would
be
proper
not
to
submit
the
possession
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
am
reluctant
to
say
that
because
if
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
heflin
stands
for
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
pyramid
punishments
of—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
that
requires
us
to
conclude
before
the
jury
has
decided
the
case
what
the
evidence
shows;
i
think
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
evidence
and
it
ought
not
to
be
submitted
but
there
are
lesser
included
defense
cases
where
there
is
virtually
no
evidence,
and
courts
of
appeals
have
nevertheless
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
understand
i
cite
that
by
analogy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
fail
to
see
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
safety,
there
is
no
conceivable
prejudice
to
the
defendant
from
submitting
the
possession
count
and
it
eliminates
the
possibility
that
an
appellate
court
might
later
determine
that
perhaps
the
jury
could
somehow
if
convicted
of
possession
and
acquitted
--
under
the
either-or
instruction
acquitted
of
robbery.
i
mean
there
would
be
out
of
a
great
abundance
of
caution
that
one
would
submit,
and
if
i
were
the
district
judge
in
this
case
i
think
would
not
have
submitted
it
because
i
think
it
is
clear
on
this
evidence
that
it
would
have
been
unnecessary.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
there
is
evidence—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
that
is
what
heflin
suggests
that
congress,
and
milanovich
where
the
possession
is
distinct
in
time
and
proved
by
the
distinct
evidence,
suggests
that
even
there
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
it
a
separate
offense.
of
course
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
person
is
guilty
of
possession,
where
he
indicted
only
for
possession
and
not
for
robbery,
there
would
be
no
obstacle
to
convicting
him
of
possession.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
be
bizarre
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
it
could,
it
could
happen
if
there
were,
if
there
were
an
either-or
instruction
then
there
would
be
a
considerable
risk
that
something
like
that
would
happen.
and
i
would
like
to
mention
a
case
to
show
that
my
concern
would
be
either-or
instruction
is
not
simply
wild
conjecture.
an
individual
attempted
to
buy
a
car
and
he
used
the
hundred
$5
dollar
bills
to
make
his
down
payment
on
the
car.
and
those
bills
were
checked
and
turned
out
to
contain
to
be
bait
money
from
a
recent
bank
robbery.
he
was
arrested
and
he
was
indicted
for
bank
robbery.
the
prosecution’s
theory
being
that
his
possession
of
these
bills,
his
recent
possession
of
these
bills
permitted
the
jury
to
infer
that
he
was
involved
in
the
robbery
itself.
the
evidence
showed
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
robbers
at
the
bank
but
it
also
showed
that
he
had
been
in
the
vicinity
of
the
bank
shortly
before
the
robbery.
the
jury
accepted
the
prosecutions’
theory
and
convicted
the
defendant
of
robbery.
the
case
was
appealed.
now
had
there
been
an
either-or
instruction,
unfortunately
there
was
no
possession
charge
in
this
case,
the
jury
would
presumably
have
to
acquit
him
of
the
possession
charge
of
which
he
was
clearly
guilty
pursuant
to
the
milanovich
either-or
instruction.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
justice
blackmun
may
remember
this
case
because
he
sat
on
the
panel
in
the
eight
circuit
at
that
time,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
evidence
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
robbery.
it
merely
shows
possession,
the
inference
from
possession
to
robbery
is
not
strong
enough
where
there
is
no
evidence
besides
the
guilty
possession
and
therefore
it
reversed
the
conviction
for
robbery
and
in
order
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
robbery
charge.
now
this
case,
united
states
against
jones
418
f2
818,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
had
jones
been
charged
with
possession
as
well
as
with
robbery,
had
the
jury
been
given
the
either-or
instruction,
they
very
likely
would
have
convicted
him
of
robbery,
acquitted
him
of
the
possession
charge.
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
said,
well
this
does
not
make
out
robbery
and
he
would
have
gone
scot-free.
now
that
is
a
serious
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
could
but
this
requires
a
degree
of
pressing
and
some
prediction
by
the
prosecutor
in
making
an
indictment
by
the
judge
and
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
and
the
question
is
why
ought
not
the
jury
be
allowed
to
consider
the
facts?
that
is
did
these
defendants’
in
fact—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
but
had
he
been
--
i
am
merely
pointing
out
that
the
cases
are
numerous
where
the
evidence
of
possession
is
stronger
than
the
evidence
of
robbery
and
there
is
ample
evidence
of
both,
where
the
robbery
conviction
if
one
is
obtained
may
fall
for
a
variety
of
reasons
on
appeal,
and—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not,
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
difference
had
he
been
found
not
guilty
of
possession.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
it
would
have
been
a
silly
verdict,
yes.
but
the
either-or
instruction
is,
is—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
really
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
even
in
milanovich
there
was
no
question
that
the
prosecutor
was
entitled
to
indictment
on
both
charges,
and
everybody
agreed
that
he
was
not
required
to
elect
between
the
charges.
the
issue
was
when
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
was
the
jury
to
be
forced
to
select
between
the
two
charges,
and
that
is
what
we
are
saying
was
the
mistaken
holding
of
milanovich
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
law
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
is
not
required
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
think
he
should
be
required
to
elect
because—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
certainly
he
should
be
required
to
read,
so
should
defense
counsel.
i
mean
that,
nobody
points,
so
should
the
judge
but
nobody
pointed
out,
i
mean
apparently
there
was
not
an
awareness
of
milanovich
but—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
our
contention,
i—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
think
both
cases
were
quite
clear
in
milanovich,
and
it
is
true
that
the
cases
are
distinguishable
but
honestly
i
do
not
think
i
can
say
to
you
that
milanovich
itself
depended
upon
that
distinction.
in
fact
justice
frankfurter's
dissent
was
based
largely
on
the
proposition
in
milanovich
that
these
were
two
distinct
defenses,
in
fact
and
therefore
the
milanovich
ruling
ought
not
to
be
held
proper.
that
is
justice
frankfurter's
thought
that
she
should
be
convictable
of
both
offenses
because
of
the
degree
of
separation
between
the
two.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
submit
that
either
the
dismissal
of
one
charge
at
that
time
or
the
either-or
instruction
would
be
erroneous.
there
is
no
harm
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
is
not
required
to
elect,
both
counts
can
go
to
the
jury
that
much
is
clear.
that
is,
it
is
established
that
both
counts
can
go
to
the
jury
in
the
normal
case.
now
i
agree
with
justice
stewart
that
in
this
case,
there
was
really
no
occasion
to
submit
the
possession
count
because
of
the
nature
of
the
evidence.
and
therefore,
harmless
error
however
in
having
done
so,
no
certainly
no
basis
for
awarding
a
new
truck.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
know
that
the
jury
found
--the
jury
finds
facts,
that
is—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
said
guilty
on
each
count,
eight
counts.
guilty
as
to
count
one,
guilty
as
to
count
two,
guilty
as
to
count
three,
and
so
on
that
is
the
form
of
the
verdict
that
is
in
the
appendix.
they
did
not
just
say
guilty,
in
other
words
they
convicted
him
separately—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
nobody
said
anything
about
milanovich,
nobody
said
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
that
i
recall,
the
case
was
treated,
there
were
two
separate
counts.
i
assume
they
were
convicted
on
--
mrs.
milanovich
was
convicted
on
each
count.
on
mr.
milanovich,
the
larceny
count,
the
possession
count
rather
i
think
he
received
a
directed
verdict
from
the
trial
court—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
object
to
the
second
part,
i
object
to
the
first
part.
i
think
the
instruction
was
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
object
so
long
as
that
count
is
subject
to
revival
in
the
events
something
happens
to
the
other
count.
yes,
we
have
no
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
not
object
to
that.
in
fact
we
believe
that
uniformly
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
punishment
on
both
counts
is
improper,
conviction
is
a
little
bit
like
the
concurrent
sentence—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
right,
we
don’t.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
then
our
view
is
that
the
conviction
would
be
revivable
at
that
point,
but
we
want
a
jury
verdict
as
guilty
in
order
to
avoid
that
possibility.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true,
that
is
verdicts
that
are
inconsistent.
in
fact,
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
milanovich
is
not
inconsistent
verdicts,
the
verdicts
are
completely
consistent
in
this
situation.
we
are
dealing
with
verdicts
that
are
inconsistent
in
law.
but
the
either-or
instruction
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
in
fact
they
possessed
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
consistent,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
is
a
very
technical
area.
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
is,
well
they
may
have
robbed
the
bank
and
they
may
have
possessed
the
proceeds
but
they
could
not
be
convicted
of
both,
and
therefore
although
nobody
doubts
that
they
robbed
the
bank
and
possessed
the
proceeds,
we
are
going
to
give
them
a
new
trial.
and
the
reason
we
are
going
to
give
them
a
new
trial
is
because
the
judge
did
not
give
an
either-or
instruction,
which
if
i
may
give
an
analogy,
it
is
a
little
bit
like
saying
to
the
jury;
you
are
asked
to
find
on,
count
one
whether
140
equals
12
inches,
and
on
count
two
whether
three
feet
equals
a
yard,
but
you
may
not
find
both.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
do
not
agree
with
that
portion
of
the
opinion
because
we
do
not
know
until
the
jury
has
returned
its
verdict,
justice
stewart,
what
has
been
done,
we
do
not
know
whether
the
person
is
a
thief,
we
have
evidence
suggesting
that
he
is
a
thief,
we
have
stronger
evidence
indicating
possession.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
true
that
if
this
case
falls
within
a
subclass
of
the
cases
in
which
we
have
had
these
issues
arise
where
i
agree
--it
would
have
been
better
to
indict
these
people
in
one
count
under
(d)
for
aggravated
bank
robbery
to
treat
the
(a)
and
(b)
as
lesser
offenses.
but
it
is
clearly
harmless
error
in
the
circumstances,
it
hardly
warrants
a
new
trial
even
if
you
were
to
hold
that
the
prosecutor
was
in
error
in
framing
his
indictment
in
that
fashion
and
that
the
court
was
in
error
in
submitting
it
to
the
jury.
the
problem
will
--that
holding
i
think
would
be
correct.
the
problem
i
assume
would
be
back
before
this
court
shortly
because
i
do
submit
with
all
respect
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated
that
it
is
a
continuing
problem
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
theft
statutes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
see
why
not,
it
is
within
the
questions
presented,
it
was
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
mentioned
it
in
our
brief,
but
we
have
not
argued
it
in
our
brief.
i
mentioned
it
here
at
oral
argument,
i
think
it
would
be
open
be
for
this
court
to
decide
it
on
that
basis.
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttle.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
just
one
or
two
points.
with
respect
to
justice
brennan’s
question
about
whether
the
statute
did
not
indicate
that
there
should
be
rather
than
this
equal
either-or
instruction,
perhaps
a
priority
instruction
that
asks
the
jury
first
to
consider
robbery
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right,
well
heflin—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
it
certainly
was
a
statutory
construction.
what
is
not
clear
was
whether
the
thrust
of
heflin
was
to
the
pyramidal
punishment
that
existed
in
heflin
or
whether
it
was
to
the
entry
of
dual
convictions—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
made
both
points
that
it
was
a
separate
class
of
offenders.
my
point
is
that
in
effect
counsel
concedes
away
his
case
here
to
agree
with
your
suggestion,
because
if
it
is
true
that
the
jury
ought
first
to
consider
robbery,
and
if
it
finds
the
defendant
guilty
of
robbery,
or
admits
its
consideration
of
the
possession
or
receipt
offense,
then
the
remedy
surely
is
simply
to
vacate
the
possession.
conviction,
but
not
certainly
to
grant
a
new
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
that
would
certainly
be
better
than
returning
an
acquittal
on
the
possession
count.
that
would
at
least
theoretically
leave
the
possession
count
open,
but
the
question
is
why
is
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration
should
the
jury
be
told
that?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but,
but
the
robbery
conviction
maybe
ultimately
overturned
for
reasons
that
would
not
infect
a
possession
conviction.
and
it
seems
to
me
as
a
matter
of
sound
administration
of
justice,
you
allow
the
jury
to
return
verdicts
on
both,
and
then
it
is
the
judge
who
enters
no
judgment
of
conviction
on
the
possession
count
but
only
on
the
robbery
count.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
all
that
i
am
saying
is
that-that
one,
that
at
law
there
is
no
crime
of
possession
for
one
who
robs—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct
in
this
case
because
whether
or
not
somebody
is
one
who
robs
has
only
determined
at
the
conclusion
of
the
litigation.
and
possibly
even
amendable
to
collateral
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
that—
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
we
do
not
challenge
the
ultimate
conclusion
that
ultimately
one
who
is
convicted
of
robbery
ought
not
to
have
a
conviction
on
his
record
for
possession.
but
we
are
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
the
administration
of
justice,
you
ought
to
let
the
jury
find
the
facts.
in
most
cases
you
will
have
quite
separate
evidence
of
possession
independent
of
the
evidence
of
robbery.
and
if
you
do
not
have
the
jury
return
a
verdict
with
respect
to
that,
you
run
the
risk
of
having
to
have
a
later
trial
or
of
having
double
jeopardy
objections
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
robbery
conviction
that
would
not
taint
the
possession
conviction.
if,
it
is
only
one
who
is
convicted
of
robbery
who
is
immune
from
possession.
it
is
not,
not
one
who
is
a
robber,
it
is
only
one
who
is
convicted
of
robbery
who
is
immune
from
the
possession
conviction.
that
is
we
strenuously
disagree
and
we
have
a
petition
pending
before
the
court
in
the
phillips
case
that
you
cannot
setup
as
a
defense
to
a
possession
charge
that
you
are
robber.
it
is
only
after
conviction
that
the
preclusion
of
the
possession
charge
comes
into
play
in
our
view.
thank
you.
