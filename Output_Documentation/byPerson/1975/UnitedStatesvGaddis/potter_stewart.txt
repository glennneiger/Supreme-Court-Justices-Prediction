justice
potter
stewart
mr.
frey,
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
agree
do
you
not,
that
the
person
cannot
be
convicted
of
both
bank
robbery
and
of
receiving
or
possessing
the
proceeds
of
the
robbery
of
the
same
robbery.
justice
potter
stewart
which
had
a,
an
objection
to
an
instruction
in
this
case
that
had
said
if
you
find
that
these
people
were
the
robbers,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
you
should
convict
them
of
bank
robbery.
but
if
they
were
the
robbers,
they
were
not
guilty
of
receiving
stolen
goods?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
the
evidence
was
in
this
case
that
they
was
a
robbery—
justice
potter
stewart
17
days
apart,
it
had
evidence
of
each
one
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
was
no
question
to
milanovich
case
it
had
the
jury
believe
that
mrs.
milanovich
and
her
husband
had
indeed
been
drivers
of
the
getaway
car,
that
they
would
have
been
themselves
guilty
of
bank
robbery.
if
that
was
up
for
the
jury
and
there
was
wholly
different
and
independent
evidence
indicating
that
some
17
days
later
she
agreed,
dug
up
some,
made
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
dug
up
the
proceeds
of
a
bank
robbery,
and
those
were
two
separate
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
sorry,
that
from
a
commissary
down
below.
justice
potter
stewart
if
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
for
the
prosecution
is
that
the
defendant,
i
should
just
simplify
to
say
there
is
one,
entered
a
bank,
armed,
held
up
the
teller,
left
with
the
money.
is
there
any
ground
at
all
upon
which
the
trial
judge
had
instructed
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
offense
of
possession
or
receipt
of
the
proceeds
of
a
bank
robbery?
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
that
the
question?
given
my
case
where
all
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
indicates
that
the
defendant
was
a
bank
robber.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
improper
to
submit
it,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
stewart
lesser
included
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
anymore
than
in
a
bank
robbery
case,
it
would
have
been
--it
would
not
be
error
for
a
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
on
those,
on
a
direct
offense?
there
is
just
no
evidence
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
heflin
said
this
was
not
lesser
included
offense,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
not
an
analogy,
given
heflin.
this
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
of
possession?
justice
potter
stewart
well
certainly
if
he
had
stolen,
had
it,
and
he
possessed
it,
but
you
certainly
can
argue
very
sensibly
that
was
not
what--
the
congress
did
not
intend
to,
to
make
a
separate
crime
out
of
possessing
what
you
stole?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
is
you
say
undoubtedly
and
so
on,
that
is
a
hypothetical
case.
in
the
actual
jones
case,
he
could
have
been
indicted
for
possession,
and
there
would
have
been
no
double
jeopardy
questions
whatsoever
because
he
had
not
been
charged
with
that
the
first
time
around
as
you
give
it
to
us.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
jury
in
the
jones
case
was
not
allowed
to
consider
the
alternatives,
he
was
not
charged
with
possession,
you
just
told
us—
justice
potter
stewart
well
milanovich
was
a
totally
different
case
from
this
on
its
facts,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
what
the
jury
convicted
him?
justice
potter
stewart
they
just
said
guilty,
didn’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
in
milanovich?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
did
they
in
milanovich,
was
there
just
a
general
verdict
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
the
government
object
to
saying
that
the
instruction
was
improper,
and
that
at
least
--
and
that
the
conviction
for
possession
should
be
set
aside
as
well
as
its
sentence,
but
no
new
trial
i
should
say?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
would
not
object
afterwards
to
saying,
you
cannot
be
convicted
for
both
therefore
we
will
set
aside
one
count
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
on
appeal,
on
appeal,
on
appeal
if
the
court
of
appeals
says,
it
should
not
have
been
convicted
of
both
counts.
we
set
aside
the
besides
the
conviction
on
the
possession
count
and
sentence—
justice
potter
stewart
because
conviction
on
both
counts
is
improper?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know
but
you
would
not
object
to
setting
aside
the
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
milanovich,
as
you
pointed
out
justice
frankfurter
dissented.
and
in
his
dissent
he
said
this,
it
is
hornbook
law
that
a
thief
cannot
be
charged
with
committing
two
offenses;
that
is
stealing
and
receiving
the
goods
he
has
stolen.
this
is
not
a
manner
of
inconsistent
of
the
general
rule
of
inconsistent
offenses,
this
is
a
specific
rule
as
to
robbery
and
receiving
stolen
property.
this
is
the
dissenting
opinion,
i
am
reading.
justice
potter
stewart
not
in
this
case,
you
do
not.
you
have
nothing
but
evidence
that
he
was
a
bank
robber
not
a
thief,
a
robber.
justice
stewart
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
driver
of
this
car
take
a
shot
at
the
policeman?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
makes
any
difference
as
to
whether
he
was
participant
in
the
robbery?
justice
potter
stewart
the
man
who
guides
the
robbers
inside
the
bank
is
not
a
party
to
the
robbery?
justice
potter
stewart
no
matter
what
maybe
the
length
and
time
between
the
date
of
the
robbery
and
the
incident
which
led
to
the
possession
charged?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
about
the
same
person?
justice
potter
stewart
the
robber
cannot
be
can't
be
convicted
of
possession,
somebody
else
could
be
convicted
of
possession.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
a
situation
where
gaddis
was
convicted
of
robbery?
justice
potter
stewart
that
being
so,
no
matter
what
the
interval
may
have
been
which
led
to
the
possession
count.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
heflin
said.
heflin
said
that
the
possession
count
was
directed
toward
a
wholly
different
kind
of
a
defendant,
the
person
who
is
not
the
robber,
is
that
not
what
heflin
said?
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
is
no
question
what
the
jury
decided
as
respect
to
the
individual
counts,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
made
separate,
in
turn
separate
verdicts
on
the
different
counts,
each
count?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
point
is
in
any
event,
the
jury
under
this
statute
could
have
convicted
on
these
facts,
of
robbery
or
nothing?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
some
suggestion
that
davis
now
refuses
to
testify
of
any
new
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
government’s
interest
be
adequately
protective,
if
the
jury
was
instructed
to
return
a
verdict
on
only
one
of
these
counts?
suppose
that
it
was
instructed
that,
if
you
find
these
people
guilty
of
robbery,
bank
robbery,
return
no
verdict
on
the
possessions?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
but,
and
then
--
if
you
had
both
counts
in
the
indictment
you
would
just
tell
the
jury
that
you
do
not
that,
if
you
find,
unless
you
find
the
person
guilty
of
robbery
you
may
convict
him
for
possession
if
the
evidence
warrants
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
then
you
are,
you
are
disagreeing
with
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
court
has
adopted
in.
well,
it
is
namely
that
there
isn’t
any
crime
of
possession
on
the
part
of
one
who
robs?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
tell
me
mr.
frey,
who
should
be
held
guilty?
let
us
suppose
you
had
an
indictment
that
had
separate
robbery
and
possession
counts
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
instructed
the
jury
that
if
you
find
the
person
guilty
of
robbery,
do
not
find
him
guilty
of
possession?
but
you
may
find
him
guilty
of
possession
if
you
do
not
find
him
guilty
of
robbery.
now
you
tell
me,
what
people
do
you
think
ought
--the
government
ought
to
be
able
to
hold
guilty
of
possession
who,
wouldn’t
be
covered
by
the
second
count
of
possession?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
are
saying
that
there
are
three
crimes
involved
now
in
this
statute.
one,
one
a
class
of
persons
who
just
received,
but
then
there
are
two
crimes
that
maybe
committed
by
another
group
of
people,
either
they
posses
or
they
rob?
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
opinion
and
judgment
that
i
am
authorized
to
announce
this
morning
is
that
in
number
74-1141,
united
states
against
gaddis,
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
as
well
as
the
last.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
gaddis
and
his
co-respondent,
were
convicted
in
a
federal
district
court
of
bank
robbery
and
also
convicted
of
receiving
the
proceeds
of
the
same
robbery.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
judgments
of
conviction
and
reminded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
and
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
holding
that
a
person
cannot
be
convicted
and
punished
for
robbing
a
bank
and
separately
convicted
and
punished
for
receiving
the
proceeds
of
the
same
robbery.
we
further
hold
that
a
new
trial
is
not
necessary
to
correct
the
district
court's
error
in
this
case.
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
written
opinion
of
the
court,
filed
today.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined
and
as
in
the
last
case,
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
