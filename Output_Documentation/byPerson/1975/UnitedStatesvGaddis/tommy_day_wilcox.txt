mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
i
will
address
myself
to
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
begin,
i
would
also
like
to
make
a
notation,
a
correction
if
you
will
in
the
respondents’
brief
on
the
merits.
it
is
on
page
nine,
and
it
comes
from
a
quote
by
judge
donahue
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
united
state
v.
tyler.
about
one-third
way
down
the
page
the
quote
begins,
and
it
begins
by
leaving
all
of
the
word
“a”,
it
is
a
typographical
error
i
assume.
but
that
particular
quote
should
read,
“a
case”,
it
does
not
decide
only
the
exact
factual
question
that
it
presents
and
then
it
continues
on
as
it
is
there.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
a
case,
sir.
page
nine
on
the
merits.
before
beginning
my
argument,
let
me
say
that
my
name
is
tommy
day
wilcox
and
i
am
counsel
for
the
respondents
gaddis
and
birt.
in
the
trial
of
this
particular
case,
i
was
trial
counsel
for
billy
sunday
birt.
mr.
tony
mann
of
megan
georgia
was
the
attorney
for
mr.
bobby
gene
gaddis.
at
the
conviction
mr.
mann
and
i,
as
co-counsel
represented
these
two
respondents
on
appeal,
i
now
represent
each,
the
two
of
them
together
of
course.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
the
two-two
responses
to
that
question.
certainly,
i
accept
responsibility
for
these
respondents
for
not
requesting
that
charge.
our
theory
of
that
particular
case
of
course,
that
interviewing
these
two
defendants
was
one
that
they
were
not
involved
at
all,
either
as
possessing
or
robbery.
so
from
that
standpoint
that
was
one
reason
we
did
not
request
it.
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
i
was
not
aware
of
this
line
of
cases
and
therefore
i
did
not
request
this
particular
instruction.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
your
honor,
unless
it
is
plain
error.
and
certainly
i
would—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
the
reason
this
was
plain
error
is
it,
for
one
thing
whether
or
not
an
objection
is
made
as
plain
error
or
not
more
times,
and
that
goes
to
the
facts
in
the
case,
so
the
courts
that
have
considered
have
said
that
anyway,
whether
that
evidence
is
overwhelming
or
not.
but
to
this
particular
point
i
would
cite
the
court’s
attention
to
at
least
three
appellate
courts
that
were
presented
with
this
particular
question
and
decided
that
it
was
plain
error
and
the
case
not
to
give
the
particular
instruction
that
should
have
been
requested
--
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
the
case
of
united
states
v.
roach
and
o’neal
v.
united
states,
and
those
cases
went
off
on
the
fact
that,
and
also
that,
and
baker
versus
united
states.
almost
the
same
thought
that
i
am
giving
here,
your
honor.
one,
the
evidence
was
not
overwhelming
in
those
particular
cases
and
the
court
concluded
that
it
was
plain
error,
and
they
went
to
certainly
the
merits
of
the
defendants
claim.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
certainly,
we
bear
some
of
the
responsibility.
but
in
this
particular
case
and
in
this
particular
situation,
the
question
here
is
how
to
avoid,
i
think
your
honor,
the
error
that
was
committed
by
the
lower
court.
first
of
all
the
prosecution
has
all
the
facts
of
the
case,
they
certainly
did
in
this
case
and
that
mr.
davis
was
arrested.
and
after
getting
his
statement,
this
particular
indictment
ensued
the
prosecution
then
as
mr.
justice,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
milanovich
decision
said
it
would
better
that
be
to
have
the
prosecution
elect.
whether
or
not
at
the
onset,
they
were
going
to
indict
for
possession
and
for
robbery.
and
second
of
course,
the
prosecution
could
have
dismissed
this
particular
charge
before
it
went
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
of
course
has
some
duty
to
properly
instruct
the
jury.
but
no,
your
honor,
again
we
would
say
that
certainly
it
was
my
responsibility
and
i
did
not
request
that
particular
charge
in
this
case.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
in
this
particular
situation,
i
can
only
speak
from
my
experience
in
this
particular
case.
this
was
the
very
first
case,
i
participated
in
as
a
trial
attorney,
and
is
this
is
the
first
case
i
participated
in
here,
no
excuse
of
course.
but
our
defense
was,
one;
that
we
did
not
participate
either
as
the
robber
or
as
the
possessor,
perhaps
we
still
should
have
had
the
duty
to
request
this
particular
charge.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
either
before
the
case
is
tried
or
before
the
case
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
yes
we
did,
we
have
made
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
--
conclusion
of
the
prosecution’s
case
and
also
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
as
a
whole.
if
i
might
comment
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
one
brief
comment
before
beginning
my
argument,
that
is
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
counsel
frey.
certainly
we
are
clear
in
acquitting
this
case,
but
actual
trial
of
this
case,
the
only
evidence
it
connected
either
gaddis
or
birt
with
the
robbery
of
this
bank
in
loganville,
georgia,
was
a
testimony
this
co-defendant
gaddis.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
independent
evidence
to
otherwise
connect
them
with
the
robbery
of
the
bank.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
interestingly
enough
the
money
was
found
in
the
possession
of
the
wife
of
mr.
davis,
the
co-defendant.
she
took
some
of
the
marked
money
to
the
bank,
the
fbi
discovered
it
there,
went
to
her
house
and
the
remainder
of
the
money
or
a
portion
of
the
money
was
found
in
her
deep
freezer.
if
the
court
will.
but
none
of
the
money,
neither
masked
guns
nor
independent
identification
was
ever
given
as
to
gaddis
and
birt
at
the
trial
of
this
particular
case.
to
the
court’s
submission,
i
will
present
two
arguments
in
support
of
respondents’
position
before
this
case.
first,
this
court’s
decision
in
milanovich
v.
united
states,
which
is
applicable
to
the
case
involved
in
our
view,
is
an
appropriate
statement
of
the
law
where
defendant
is
charged
and
convicted,
both
of
taking
and
receiving
the
same
property.
second,
any
suggestion
that
an
appellate
court
rendered
the
error
that
was
committed
in
the
trial
court,
by
ordering
the
trial
court
to
either
dismiss
the
taking
conviction
or
the
possession
conviction
as
improper,
in
our
view;
whether
under
the
guise
of
some
rule
of
priority,
what
has
become
known
as
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine.
petitioner
has
properly
stated
the
rule
enunciated
by
this
court
in
milanovich,
and
again
that
rule
simply
says
that
where
the
government
chooses
to
indict
both
for
robbery
and
for
possession,
then
it
is
the
duty
or
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
trial
judge
to
give
an
either-or
instruction.
further,
given
heflin
v.
united
states,
the
rationale
of
this
milanovich
decision
is
appropriate
to
this
case,
where
these
particular
defendants
were
charged
and
convicted
on
a
federal
bank
robbery
statute.
however,
in
his
argument
here
today,
the
petitioner
attempts
to
distinguish
the
case
at
bar
on
the
facts,
and
thereby
take
it
out
from
under
the
purview
of
milanovich.
in
our
view,
the
factual
pattern
in
these
two
cases
is
much
the
same,
especially
when
viewed
toward
the
activities
of
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car.
to
point
up
what
happens
in
a
case
and
in
our
opinion
why
the
government
would
choose
to
indict,
both
for
robbery
and
for
possession,
i
cite
this
court’s
attention
to
a
recent
eighth
circuit
case,
dixon
versus
united
states,
507
federal
2d.
683.
in
that
case,
there
were
three
robbers.
one
drove
the
getaway
car,
he
was
indicted,
and
that
was
dixon.
a
mistrial
was
declared
as
to
the
robbery,
but
he
was
found
guilty
as
to
the
possession.
that
particular
panel
concluded
that
the
no-charge
was
given,
but
it
was
harmless
error
given
to
verdict,
and
the
comment
was
that
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car
acted
only
as
an
aider
and
abettor
to
the
robber.
and
therefore
it
could
be
conceptualized
as
a
separate
offense.
this
discussion
of
the
distinction
between
the
two,
engenders,
we
think
a
consideration
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
single
transaction
or
two
separate
transactions.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
the
evidence
adduced
at
the
trial,
given
davis’
testimony,
was
as
i
recall
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car
did
fire
at
the
policeman
when
he
arrived
at
the
scene.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
i
do
not,
your
honor.
certainly
if
a
separate
charge
of
assault,
as
to
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car
would
have
been
proper.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
under
an
aiding
and
abetting
charge
where
there
had
certainly
a
jury
could
return
that
type
of
verdict,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
but
juries
do
return
verdict
saying
that
drivers
of
getaway
cars
as
evidenced
by
the
dixon
case.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
not
really,
your
honor.
certainly,
given
the
legislative
history
of
2113(c),
the
possession
is
only
as
a
separated
offense,
it
contemplates
separate
people.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
no,
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
i
am
not
taking
that
position.
i
am
saying
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case
when
looking
at
the
driver
of
the
getaway
car,
there
really
is
not
distinction
between
this
particular
case
and
the
case
of
the
milanovich
situation,
where
the
lady
there
drove
the
getaway
car
to
the
scene—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
she
did
not
shoot
anybody,
that
is
true.
and
that,
if
in
fact
we
consider
that
an
assault
charge
then
it
would
be
proper
to
separate
count.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
they
were.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
given
the
facts.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
well
the
point
is
simply
this,
that
in
our
position
whether
or
not
it
is
a
single
transaction
or
two
transactions
is
of
no
import.
and
that
the
milanovich
situation
and
the
rule
of
law
there
was
a
rule
or
rationale
that
is
applicable
to
these
types
of
cases
whether
or
not
it
is
a
single
transaction
or
two
transactions.
i
have
mentioned
the
dixon
case,
only
to
show
the
court
if
i
might
that
the
reason
for
the
possession
count
oftentimes,
is
in
fact
juries
do
return
verdicts
when
a
person
is
found
guilty
of
possession
and
not
robbery,
even
though
he
drove
the
getaway
car
and
waited
for
the
robbers
to
return.
similar
case,
the
fifth
circuit
case,
baker
v.
united
states,
where
there
are
same
facts.
the
man
drives
the
car,
he
waits
for
the
robbers
to
go
in,
he
identifies
the
car
in
the
parking
lot,
steals
it
and
drives
the
robbers
away.
there,
that
particular
case,
no
either-or
instruction
was
given
and
the
case
was
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
yes,
your
honor.
you
can
indict,
but
the
point
is
of
course,
that
the
jury
should
be
instructed
before
they
retire,
that
given
the
history
of
this
particular
statute
under
which
these
men
were
charged,
that
they
have
the
choice.
to
first
of
all
determine
whether
or
not
these
folks
are
robbers.
and
if
they
are,
fine,
they
cannot
also
be
convicted
of
possession,
unless
a
separate
person.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
in
this
particular—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct.
and
of
course
under
that
particular
factual
situation
then,
the
jury
could
return
a
verdict—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
he
cannot
be
convicted,
that
is
correct.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
under
this
statute.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
certainly
this
court
relied
on
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
when
they
rendered
that
opinion.
and
i
might
add,
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned
in
this
case
on
that
particular
point,
while
mr.
davis
chose
to
identify
mr.
gaddis
as
the
driver
of
the
car.
the
evidence
at
the
trial
of
the
case
was
that
billy
sunday
birt
had
a
very
serious
speech
impediment,
and
had
had
to
the
testimony
of
a
numerous—several
people
throughout
his
life.
and
it
is
possible
that
that
particular
jury
decided
that
yes,
these
two
men
were
involved,
but
may
have
decided
that
birt
was
in
fact
driving
the
car.
this
is
on
the
conjunction
on
my
part,
but
it
is
the
real
reason
that
we
are
here
today
is
whether
or
not
we
want
to
look
behind
what
the
jury
decided.
these
facts
presented
to
this
court
in
the
coolness(ph)
of
this
hour
appears
to
be
just
open
and
close,
this
particular
jury
was
out
for
six
and
one-half
hours,
this
appears
to
be
a
clear
case.
but
certainly
in
the
state
courts
of
the
state
of
georgia,
where
a
man
cannot
be
convicted
on
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
a
co-defendant,
this
case
may
not
have
even
gotten
to
the
jury.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
my
only
point
was
there
is—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
they
did.
there
is
some
concern
in
my
mind
whether
or
not
the
jury
decided
it
was
birt
or
gaddis
driving
the
car,
that
was
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
question
is
what
remedies
to
be
applied
in
this
case,
given
the
error
committed.
we
can
see
that
the
lower
courts,
during
this
interval
between
1961
and
today’s
date,
have
attempted
various
methods
to
avoid
the
new
trial
mandate
of
milanovich.
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
case
pointed
out
by
mr.
frey,
that
mr.
justice
clark
set
on
in
the
fourth
circuit.
there
sellers,
the
defendant,
four
counts
of
robbery
and
possession
and
he
was
convicted.
and
when
the
instruction
was
not
given,
and
the
appellate
court
there
decided
that
the
remedy
should
be
that
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
trial
court
and
there
the
prosecution
could
elect
whether
or
not
they
would
let
the
possession
or
lesser
sentence
stand
or
whether
or
not
they
sought,
would
seek
to
have
a
new
trial.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
it
is
not,
your
honor,
because
i
have
the
feel
that
what
has
been
done
there
is
that
an
appellate
court
then
has
looked
at
the
facts
there
really,
i
am
almost
arguing
for
fairness
on
behalf
of
the
government,
and
that
the
appellate
court
has
decided
that
this
man
was
guilty
of
possession
but
was
not
guilty
of
robbery.
and
my
fear
is
of
course,
on
balance,
if
it
is
sent
back
and
said
drop
the
possession
there
guilty
of
robbery
there
again
in
some
way
usurp
the
authority
of
the
jury,
which
is
this
case
is
all
about
in
my
opinion.
but
the
sellers
case
also
concerns
me,
but
is
one
way
appellate
courts
have
looked
at
this
problem.
and
certainly
the
tyler
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
there
the
appellate
court
said,
well
we
have
a
sentence
stay
of
six
years
for
possession
and
six
years
for
robbery.
so
under
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
we
would
not
even
look
at
this
particular
case.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
for
number
of
reasons.
i
have
a
real
question
and
only
this
court
can
know
after
the
benton
case,
benton
v.
maryland,
the
real
thrust
of
the
concurrent
sentence
approach
at
this
point.
but
i
think
certainly
here
there
was
a
general
sentence,
concurrent
sentences
cases
had
not
gone
to
where
there
is
a
general
sentence.
second
of
all
as
in
the
recent
case
--
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
we
could
go
back
and
have
the
trial
judge
breakdown
the
particular
years
on
each
statute.
that
would
be
simple
enough
and
would
correct
that
objection.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
not
to
bring
it
under
concurrent
sentence
doctrine,
your
honor.
because
in
this
particular
case,
as
in
united
states
v.
belt,
a
very
recent
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
516
federal
2d.
873.
the
court
there
concluded
that
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
lacks
propriety,
where
the
prime
is
charged
of
various
and
serious
and
differing
in
substance.
and
the
possibility
of
collateral
affects
is
what
that
particular
court
went
to.
and
certainly
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
concludes
that
there
is
one
valid
count,
and
of
course
the
error
here
we
say
goes
to
both
counts.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
the
objection
would
be,
mr.
justice,
that
the
same
fear
that
this
court
had
in
milanovich
would
be
of
course
evidence
and
that
is
that
an
appellate
court
had
decided
which
offense
these
particular
men
were
guilty
of.
and
we
still
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
correctly
instructed
jury
would
have
returned
the
verdict
of
possession
--
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
we
want
a
new
trial
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
well
certainly,
we
made
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
after
the
evidence
was
adduced
to
trial
and
then
again—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct
at
that
time.
our
main
fear
is
of
course,
as
i
have
already
pointed
out,
that
given
the
decision
in
milanovich
and
given
the
decision
in
heflin,
we
find
nothing
to
take
this
case
out
from
under
the
purview
of
those
two
decisions.
and
by
the
same
token,
the
majority
of
appellate
courts
and
the
interim
have
given
this
same
set
of
facts,
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
in
the
fifth
circuit
alone
there
have
been
four
or
five
cases
in
particular
on
the
same
facts
that
had
been
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
and
certainly
the
proposition
that
the
government
offers,
that
in
some
way
this
case
should
be
sent
back
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
be
instructed
that
these
two
particular
defendants
are
guilty
of
something,
either
possession
or
robbery.
and
it
is
your
duty
to
find
either-or,
that
i
find
no
precedent
for
that
and—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
simply
from
the
standpoint
of
a
rule
of
law,
because
if
in
fact
we
decide
or
a
court
decides
that
there
was
a
distinction
to
made
here,
robbery
or
possession
and
we
will
make
that
now
given
this
record.
that
this
is
a
beginning
of
the
usurpation
of
the
jury’s
function,
which
was
in
fact
finder.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
certainly,
that
is
a
hard
proposition
to
argue
with.
if
in
fact
like
--
as
in
the
sellers
case,
the
case
is
returned
as
the
government
argued
before
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
there
contingent
there
was
dropped
the
robbery
count
and
re-sentence
these
two
particular
defendants
on
the
possession
count.
i
would
not
concede
that
point,
but—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
certainly
we
would
rather
have
a
return
of
the
case
and
upholding
the
possession
as
opposed
to
dismissing
the
possession
as
the
government
now
suggests
would
be
proper
and
leaving
intact
the
robbery
conviction.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
your
honor,
let
me
respond
to
that
question
in
this
way.
certainly,
to
give
the
court
a
new
ratification
about
these
particular
parties
as
this
remains
our
discussion
here
today.
there
is
not
much
question
that
mr.
davis
will
testify
against
mr.
birt
and
mr.
gaddis
in
our
opinion.
and
that
since
the
trial
of
this
case,
as
to
these
two
particular
defendants,
certainly
i
am
here
to
discuss
a
rule
of
law.
mr.
davis
has
testified
in
a
trial—a
murder
trial,
charging
both
gaddis
and
birt
with
a
double
murder,
they
were
convicted
in
that
trial
and
are
now
have
been
given
a
death
sentence,
two
death
sentences
in
the
state
of
georgia,
and
of
course
that
case
is
on
mandatory
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
and
of
course
mr.
davis
participated
in
that
particular
trial,
i
know
your
honors
concern
with
the
footnotes
that
the
government
has
put
in
several
briefs
before
this
court,
mr.
davis
now
had
said
that
he
would
not
testify.
but
i
can
only
give
you
my
opinion
on
that,
he
had
no
reluctance
to
testify
in
the
state
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
informed
at
this
point
now
that
the
government
seeks
help
from
gaddis
to
implicate
davis
in
some
crimes
in
that
general
area,
and
this
all
goes
to
really
of
course
who
mr.
davis
really
is.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
well,
(laughter)
your
honor,
your
honor,
began
the
discussion
where
the
question
might
not
object
and
are
asking
for
the
either-or
instruction.
i
might
add
in
that
vein,
mr.
davis’
attorney
at
this
particular
trial,
was
also
indicted
for
murder
with
birt
and
gaddis.
and
subsequent
to
the,
the
district
attorney,
i
understand,
has
certainly
decided
not
to
prosecute
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
connect
of
the
attorney.
but
mr.
davis
was
dissatisfied
with
his
representation,
so
yes,
your
honor,
i
have
a
reason
to
question
mr.
davis.
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
the
proper
method,
your
honor,
in
my
opinion
if
the
court
concluded
that,
that
would
be
proper
would
be
to
remand
this
case
to—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
in
the
end,
the
court
concluded
that
this
was
a
general
sentence
of
25
years
and
that
all
of
these
counts
merged.
and
of
course—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
he
did
sentence
separately,
ten
years
to
the
possession
and
then
had
them
merged.
i
certainly
can
find
no
objection
but—
mr.
tommy
day
wilcox
the
courts
had
considered;
of
course,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
says
that
it
cannot
run
consecutive.
so
several
courts
concluded
after
the
passage
of
the
statute,
that
subsections
(a),
(b)
and
(d)
for
purposes
of
sentencing
were
all
merged
into
the
sentence,
the
most
severe
sentence
of
25
years
was
proper.
that
is
the
terminology
but
of
course
the
same
court
has
said
that
subsection
(c),
a
possession
count
will
not
merge.
and
of
course
to
completely
answer
the
justice’s
question
about
retrial.
as
to
these
two
particular
defendants,
there
is
some
doubt
if
in
fact
this
court
concluded
that
a
new
trial
was
warranted,
given
the
two
trials
that
i
have
just
alluded
to,
whether
or
not
these
two
particular
defendants
would
be
given
a
new
trial.
my
point
here
today
is
that
we
have
an
issue
of
law,
and
i
am
here
to
discuss
some
of
that,
i
want
to
make
that
clear
if
i
might.
in
concluding,
milanovich
v.
united
states
is
a
sound
decision
and
is
appropriate
in
my
opinion
for
consideration
here.
we
respectfully
submit,
that
this
court
one
should
not
overrule
that
decision.
and
second
of
all
should
not
in
some
way
formulate
a
procedural
cure
for
the
error
that
was
committed
at
the
trial
court,
and
that
rather
this
case
should
be
remanded
for
a
new
trial
under
the
purview
of
milanovich
and
heflin.
thank
you,
your
honor.
