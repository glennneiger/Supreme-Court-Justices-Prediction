chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
united
states
against
gaddis
and
birt.
mr.
frey
you
may
precede
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
in
the
milanovich
case
there
was
a
distinction
of
facts,
wasn’t
there?
chief
justice
burger
jury
have
done
things
like
that
sometimes
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
that
the
problem
of
double
punishments
could
be
taken
care
of
by
the
sentencing
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
if
the
judge
did
indeed
give
cumulative
sentences
for
both
offenses,
that
could
be
readily
corrected
on
a
remand,
on
review.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
submission
of
both
these
questions
to
the
jury
invite
the
bizarre
result,
i
say
bizarre,
it
would
have
been
bizarre
on
this
evidence
to
find
him
not
guilty
of
bank
robbery
but
guilty
of
possession.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
those
things
have
happened?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
it
is
borne
out
by
the
opinion,
the
opinion
indicates
that
one
crime
is
committed
and
this
woman
--
the
case
against
her
for
the
bank
robbery
was
dubious
at
best
and
probably
could
not
be
made
out,
but
the
case
against
her
for
the
possession
was
perfectly
clear
two
or
three
weeks
later.mr.
deputy
solicitor
general
frey:
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
assuming
that
the
prosecutor
on
your
view,
should
not
be
required
to
make
an
election
before
he
starts,
that
is
he
is
entitled
to
wait
until
his
evidence
is
in
to
see
what
his
case
is,
where
the
strengths
and
weakness
of
his
case
is.
doesn’t
the
either-or
instruction
present
a
parallel
to
the
idea
of
dismissing
one
charge
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
talking
about
what
is
required
to
do—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
perfectly
consistent—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
did
rob
the
bank,
they
did
posses
the
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
just
a
question
of
whether
the
rule
of
law
is
that
that
is
in
effect
double
punishment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
if
that
is
the
case
by
remanding
for
reexamination
of
the
sentence
to
see
that
double
punishment
is
not
imposed
for
both
possession
and
bank
robbery.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
it
in
your
own
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
evaluating
of
plain
error
claim,
is
it
of
some
consequence
that
the
error
wasn’t
so
plain
that
the
counsel
in
the
case
didn’t
see
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
do
you
think
in
those
circumstances
the
prosecutor
should
be
required
to
elect
before
the
case
is
tried
which
count,
he
is
going
to
stand
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
move
for
dismissal
of
all
of
the
charges
at
the
close
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
was
the
money
found?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
defense
verdict,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
talking
about
the
driver
of
the
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
think,
or
do
you
think
that
is
not
the
proper
solution?
chief
justice
burger
why
do
you
say
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
was
not
--
chief
justice
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
burger
(inaudible)
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
a
(inaudible)
there
are
legal
basis
for
that,
is
that
just
where
they
discuss
sentences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
