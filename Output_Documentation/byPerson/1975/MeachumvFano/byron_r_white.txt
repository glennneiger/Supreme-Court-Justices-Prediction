suppose
two
inmates
that
is
charged
with
exactly
the
same
violation
and
one
of
them
gets
to
hearing
and
sent
to
solitary
the
other
one
does
not
get
a
hearing
and
is
transferred
to
a
maximum
security
institution.
justice
byron

white
and
the
reason
they
get
to
him
is
that
he
broke
a
rule.
and
he
said
–
and
he
asks
are
you
punishing
me?
and
they
say,
well,
yes,
i
guess
so.
justice
byron

disciplinary
board
–
there
was
not
any
disciplinary
board
involved
in
my
example,
they
just
transferred
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
opinion
is
fied,
but
he
takes
along
with
him
the
other
institution
that
is
said
that,
this
fellow
is
being
transferred
because
he
burns
things
up.
that
would
not
make
any
difference,
do
we,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
transfer
board
puts
it
–
put
something
in
his
file
and
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
my
example
what
would
they
do?
would
it
not
--
is
it
not
possible
that
they
would
say
this
fellow
burns
things
up
and
we
are
transferring.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
you
he
is
not
entitled
to
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
his
colleague
who
was
sent
to
solitary
is
entitled
a
hearing
for
breaking
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
there
were
--
it
would
be
more
like
solitary
where
there
is
a
rule
about
solitary.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
if
there
were
that
kind
of
a
predicate,
you
would
agree
there
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
say
if
there
were
rules
about
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
seem
to
say
in
your
brief
that
independently
of
any
rule,
it
may
be
that
the
constitution
itself
would
require
a
hearing
before
a
man
is
placed
in
solitary.
you
at
least
conceive
that
that
is
possible.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
do
not
need
--
you
do
not
need
to
decide
it
here,
but
if
you
think
that
is
possible
that
the
constitution
itself
might
require
a
hearing
wholly
aside
from
any
state
rule.
then
i
suppose
you
should
not
--
you
must
--
that
and
in
this
case,
which
involves
the
transfer,
you
must
face
up
to
that
possibility,
that
at
least
this
is
not
in
kind
enough
of
a
change
of
the
conditions
to
trigger
a
factual
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
two
cases
raise
a
common
question.
in
the
fano
case
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
fano
was
a
state
prisoner
in
a
medium
security
institution.
he
was
transferred
to
a
maximum
security
prison.
in
haymes,
which
is
here
on
petition
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
prisoner
was
transferred
from
one
medium
security
prison
to
another.
in
each
case
the
inmate
brought
suit,
claiming
that
the
transfer
violated
his
right
to
liberty
under
the
due
process
clause
and
that
he
was,
therefore,
entitled
to
more
procedural
due
process
than
he
had
received
in
connection
with
his
transfer.
both
courts
of
appeals
agreed
to
the
inmate
and
ordered
the
transfer
canceled.
we
reverse
both
judgments,
since
in
our
view
no
cognizable
rights
to
liberty
of
either
inmate
were
violated
by
the
transfer.
our
reasons
are
given
at
greater
length
in
the
opinions
on
file
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
these
cases.
he
has
been
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall.
