mr.
donahue
in
reciting
this
description
of
the
procedures
that
were
followed,
are
we
to
take
that
you
acknowledged
that
the
constitution
required
those
procedures?
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
why
are
they
crucial
if
the
constitution
did
not
require
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
understood
from
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question
of
mine
that
so
far
as
the
united
states
constitution
goes
massachusetts
could
have
taken
unilateral
and
what
you
call
arbitrary
actions
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
any
concern
of
ours.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
regulation
said
that
no
inmate
shall
be
transferred
from
a
medium
security
institution
to
a
maximum
security
institution
unless
he
is
guilty
of
some
kind
of
misconduct
in
the
former
institution
then
you
think
he
would
have
an
entitlement
to
stay
in
the
medium
security
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
and
could
not
be
transferred
except
upon
a
finding
that
he
was
guilty
of
misconduct
and
such
a
finding
could
be
made
only
after
according
him
some
sort
of
a
procedural
due
process
determination.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
such
substantive
regulation
of
any
kind
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
settled
it
and
paul
against
davis
resettled
it,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
agree
with
the
damage
that
as
you
say
to
be
liberty
or
property
or
life.
justice
potter
stewart
:
that
is
a
factual
--
really
it
is
largely
or
prettily
factual,
is
it
not,
whether
or
not
that
something
is
liberty
or
property.
i
suppose
if
you
--
if
the
warden
took
somebody
in
the
general
prison
population
and
put
him
in
leg-irons
or
a
straight
jacket
or
handcuffs,
that
would
be
a
deprivation
of
his
liberty
as
a
matter
of
fact,
would
it
not?
even
though
he
had
originally
been
in
the
--
inside
the
prison
in
the
general
population?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
constitution
has
a
different
meaning
does
it
not,
at
least
generally?
i
mean
that
is
a
liberty
or
freedom
that
is
protected
by
the
constitution
itself,
i.e.
the
liberty
of
a
speech,
the
liberty
of
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
that
is
one
kind
of
a
liberty.
where
that
is
not
the
case
--
that
sort
of
constitutional
liberty
is
not
implicated
here
at
all,
it
is
a
matter
of
factual
liberty,
is
it
not,
freedom?
justice
potter
stewart
not
constitutionally
protected,
but
whether
in
fact
that
the
person
was
deprived
of
his
freedom
of
movement,
and
not
his
constitutional
freedom.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
constitutional
right
to
be
out
of
jail
and
as
a
constitutionally
right
to
be
put
in
to
jail
only
after
has
been
accorded
due
process
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
quite
different.
do
you
not
see
the
difference
between
the
liberty
that
is
embodied
in
liberty
in
the
first
amendment,
on
one
hand,
which
is
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
from
the
factual
liberty
of
whether
somebody
got
his
arms
free
or
whether
he
is
in
handcuffs?
are
they
not
too
quite
different
concepts?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
factual
matter
whether
a
person
is
free
to
walk
the
streets
or
in
prison,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
a
matter
of
fact.
