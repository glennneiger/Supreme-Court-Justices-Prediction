mr.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
only
the
question
whether
the
transfer
of
prisoner
to
a
prison
with
a
higher
security
classification
implicates
the
procedural
protections
of
due
process
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
such
a
transfer
does
not
implicate
due
process.
by
its
terms
the
due
process
clause
applies
only
where
governmental
actions
threaten
to
deprive
an
individual
of
life,
liberty
and
property.
in
a
case
such
as
this,
therefore,
analysis
necessarily
begins
with
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
substantive
interest
is
at
stake,
the
substantive
interest
underlying
the
claim
or
subsumed
under
either
liberty
or
property.
as
this
court
stated
in
board
of
regents
against
roth,
to
determine
whether
due
process
requirements
apply
in
the
fist
place,
we
must
look
not
to
the
weight
but
to
the
nature
of
the
interest
at
stake.
court
of
appeals
bypassed
this
necessary
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
effected
interest.
it
formulated
the
issue
solely
in
terms
of
the
weight
of
those
interests
by
asking
whether
the
detriment
worked
by
the
challenge
transfer
was
serious
enough
to
trigger
the
application
of
due
process.
the
detriment
alone
without
more
is
not
sufficient
to
implicate
due
process.
that
match
this
court
settled
in
roth.
mr.
jones
yes,
that
is
right.
the
interest
and
reputation
in
paul
against
davis
or
the
interest
in
continued
employment
in
roth
was
not
sufficient
to
implicate
due
process
because
those
affected
interest
were
neither
liberty
nor
property.
mr.
jones
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
believe
that
it
is
important
that
the
roth
analysis
be
adhered
to
requirement
that
a
liberty
or
a
property
interest
be
affected.
a
requirement
that
is
imposed
by
the
constitution
itself
is
an
appropriate
and
wise
limitation
on
the
applicability
of
due
process.
a
contrary
rule
which
threatened
to
hamstring
the
government,
hamstring
the
essential
operations
of
government
by
requiring
a
hearing
or
other
due
process
procedure
and
virtually
every
term.
with
regard
to
the
governance
of
prisons
for
example,
the
denial
of
a
furlough,
the
termination
of
an
educational
program,
change
in
work
assignment
might
be
deemed
by
some
court
to
work
a
sufficient
detriment
implicate
due
process
and
require
a
hearing.
mr.
jones
transfer
to
a
solitary
confinement
raises
a
slightly
different
question.
as
we
note
i
think
that
in
the
footnote
15
of
page
22
of
our
brief,
there
may
be
an
issue
of
whether
the
conditions
of
solitary
confinement
are
so
different
from
those
of
other
confinements
as
to
possibly
implicate
a
constitutional
liberty.
we
would
say
that
in
answer
to
your
question
there
would
be
no
liberty
interest
of
non-constitutional
origin.
if
the
state
could
put
a
man
in
solitary
confinement
without
a
finding
in
misconduct,
that
whether
there
is
interest
of
constitutional
origin
and
that
special
circumstance
is
an
issue
and
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case.
mr.
jones
well
our
answer
to
that
would
be
that
if
there
were
no
articulated
standards
in
the
rules
governing
his
confinement
there
would
be
no
non-constitutional
origin
for
a
liberty
interest.
and
the
question
would
be
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
liberty
involved.
and
that
might
in
some
cases
be
a
factual
question.
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
factual
question
here.
mr.
jones
i
do
not
know.
mr.
jones
if
it
is
not
of
constitutional
basis,
i
am
not
sure
of
what
basis
it
is.
i
think
that
there
are
two
arguments
that
respondents
--
mr.
jones
well
that
is
a
different
way
phrasing
it
but
i
do
not
see
the
difference
in
substance.
mr.
jones
well,
they
are
different
in
this
sense.
the
first
amendment
affirmatively
grants
certain
liberties.
the
fourteenth
amendment
grants
you
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
liberty
without
due
process.
but
i
would
not
say
that
what
liberty
is
as
a
factual
question,
my
analysis
would
be
that
--
mr.
jones
mthere
is
no
doubt
about.
mr.
jones
that
is
true.
our
argument
or
let
me
rephrase
it.
as
i
understand
the
respondent’s
argument
about
constitutional
liberty.
they
say
it
is
inherent
in
the
concept
of
liberty
or
physical
freedom
from
the
control
of
the
state
is
at
the
heart
of
constitutional
liberty.
mr.
jones
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
just
setting
up
silages
and
so
that
i
could
knock
it
down
--
mr.
jones
once
a
prisoner
or
once
a
man
has
been
convicted
and
sentenced,
he
is
lawfully
subject
to
whatever
conditions
of
confinement
that
may
be
fairly
said
to
be
inherent
within
that
sentence.
an
imprisonment
in
a
maximum
security
institution
is
plainly
within
the
range
anticipated
by
a
sentence.
that
is
not
--
mr.
jones
ven
if
solitary
is
not,
that
is
correct.
indeed
counsel
for
the
state
informs
me
that
the
respondents
in
this
very
were
actually
sentenced
to
a
maximum
security
institution.
a
fortiori,
they
have
constitutionally
based
interest
in
avoiding
a
retransfer
to
such
an
institution.
now
this
is
not
to
say
that
a
man
is
deprived
of
all
possible
constitutional
liberties
when
he
is
convicted
and
sentenced.
mr.
jones
in
morrissey
against
brewer,
he
was
different
for
one
of
two
reasons.
first,
under
the
statutes
and
regulations
governing
his
parole,
his
parole
could
not
be
revoked
unless
and
until
it
was
proved
that
he
had
violated
the
conditions
of
that
parole,
i.e.
he
had
a
non-constitutional
entitlement
that
amounted
to
a
liberty
interest.
now
a
second
possibility
was
that
he
had
a
constitutionally
based
interest
once
he
had
been
freed
on
parole.
i
mean
it
may
be
that
once
a
man
is
liberated
on
parole,
he
takes
on
some
of
the
protected
liberty
interest
that
were
deprived
from
him,
taken
away
from
him
upon
the
conviction
in
sentence.
in
this
case
there
is
no
right
of
constitutional
origin
nor
is
there
any
of
non-constitutional
origin
as
i
have
to
show.
mr.
jones
that
is
true.
in
wolff
against
mcdonnell,
the
predicate
for
the
court’s
opinion
was
that
good
time
could
not
be
forfeited
unless
and
until
it
was
shown
that
there
had
been
misconduct.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
there
can
be
a
transfer
to
a
prison
even
to
a
maximum
security
prison
without
any
showing
by
the
state
of
misconduct.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutes,
regulations
or
rules
governing
the
conditions
of
confinement
that
prevents
the
state
from
making
that
transfer
for
any
or
no
reason,
but
for
any
reason
that
the
custodian
deems
appropriate.
mr.
jones
footnote
19
in
the
wolff
opinion
seemed
to
include
a
factual
assumption
that
there
was
a
statutory
regulatory
predicate
that
a
man
could
not
be
placed
in
solitary
confinement
unless
the
state
had
shown
misconduct.
mr.
jones
then
there
would
be
an
entitlement
of
non-constitutional
origin
that
would
amount
to
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
jones
that
is
correct.
if
the
state
adopted
a
rule
about
transfer
which
said
that
a
man
may
be
transferred
to
a
higher
security
institution
only
if
it
is
shown
that
he
is
guilty
of
misconduct,
then
the
man
has
a
protected
right,
whether
that
is
a
liberty
interest
or
a
property
interest
one
need
not
inquire
into,
he
has
an
entitlement
that
is
safeguarded
by
the
guarantee
of
due
process.
mr.
jones
yes.
we
--
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
jones
well,
it
is
not
that
the
detriment
is
serious
enough.
all
we
meant
to
suggest
in
our
footnote
with
regard
to
solitary
confinement
was
that
there
maybe
some
elements
of
personal
freedom
from
physical
control
of
the
state
that
have
not
been
wholly
divested
from
the
prisoner
upon
conviction
in
sentence.
we
do
not
concede
that
that
is
necessarily
the
case.
but
we
suggest
that
that
may
be
a
possibility.
mr.
jones
well,
i
take
it
that
other
than
the
eighth
amendment
nothing
would
prevent
the
state
from
imposing
that
as
a
crime
for
proven
--
i
mean
as
a
punishment
for
proven
crime.
mr.
jones
well,
i
do
not
try
to
distinguish
between
property
interest
and
liberty
interest.
i
think
that
liberty
interest
can
emanate
from
statutes
and
regulations.
mr.
jones
i
am
not
sure
i
fully
understand
that
hypothetical,
if
the
man
is
released
--
mr.
jones
i
see.
well,
my
answer
to
it
and
it
is
the
answer
i
have
been
giving
to
the
other
questions
i
think
is
that
if
there
is
a
non-constitutional
origin
for
his
interest,
that
is
if
it
the
statute
or
regulation
or
rule
provides
that
his
furlough
or
whatever
it
is
cannot
be
revoked
unless
it
is
determined
that
he
is
guilty
of
something
than
he
has
an
interest
that
requires
some
kind
of
due
process
determination
before
it
can
be
deprived.
mr.
jones
they
could
not
do
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
--
mr.
jones
well
he
had
an
expectancy
that
was
of
constitutional
origin.
his
expectancy
is
that
he
has
all
of
the
rights
and
privileges
of
freedom
from
the
restraint,
the
physical
restraint
of
the
state
that
is
enjoyed
by
all
citizens.
that
is
a,
it
seems
to
me,
constitutionally
based
liberty.
that
is
not
founded
in
a
specific
non-constitutional
statute
but
is
of
the
essence
of
constitutional
liberty.
mr.
jones
that
however
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
jones
mr.
justice
stevens
that
--
mr.
jones
under
my
theory
there
is
no
answer
yet,
i
mean
we
do
not
a
position
on
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
my
theory
is
twofold.
one,
if
there
is
a
statute,
regulation
or
rule
which
does
not
exist
in
your
hypothetical
that
creates
an
entitlement
then
due
process
attaches.
on
the
other
hand,
if
there
is
an
invasion
of
constitutional
liberty
greater
than
that
inherent
in
the
--
that
it
can
fairly
be
deemed
to
be
inherent
in
the
sentence
then
may
be.
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
reach
that.
mr.
jones
if
good
time
mr.
justice
stevens
--
mr.
jones
they
would
be
better
off
in
a
constitutional
sense
because
they
would
not
have
to
afford
elaborate
hearings.
they
might
not
be
better
off
in
a
penological
sentence.
there
are
many
questions
i
have
not
covered
but
if
the
court
has
no
further
question
itself.
thank
you.
