chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-252,
meachum
against
fano.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
donahue
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
review
of
the
status
right
springs
from
the
constitution
or
from
the
regulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you
do
not
(inaudible)
that
were
permitted
to
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
to
the
rights
the
prisoner
involved
in
the
case
of
good
time,
good
behavior
credit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
amendment
to,
except
for
the
eighth
amendment
mr.
jones,
i
am
laying
aside
all
humanitarian
considerations.
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
state
from
saying
that
every
person
convicted
of
homicide
of
first
or
second
degree
will
be
confined
in
solitary
confinement
permanently
laying
aside
the
eighth
amendment
cruel
and
inhuman
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
morrissey
and
brewer
standards
would
probably
be
thought
to
apply
to
the
halfway
of
situation
that
justice
marshall
poses.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
work
release
where
he
is
out
either
going
to
school
or
job
or
both
and
provided
he
meets
certain
conditions
such
much
like
the
conditions
of
parole,
he
is
allowed
to
stay
at
liberty.
now
the
termination
of
that
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
was
posing
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
jones.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
would
you
consider
a
change
from
an
11
o’clock
lights
out
hour
in
the
prison
to
9
o’clock,
a
deprivation
that
required
some
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
most
of
the
questions
we
are
asking
about
are
not
before
the
court,
but
we
are
trying
to
prove
that
what
you
are
driving
at.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
extend
it
then,
that
the
lights
out
at
9
instead
of
11
cell
doors
locked
at
9
instead
of
11.
that
restricts
a
lot
of
movement
now.
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
a
hearing
is
sort
of
a
rule
making
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
affect
everybody
in
the
institution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
have
still
got
several
times
i
am
interested,
suppose
they
have
just
built
a
new
institution
in
massachusetts
of
the
same
level
of
security
as
that
prisoners
then
confined,
and
they
transfer
that
to
--
a
prisoner
to
that
place
without
consulting
him.
he
was
just
informed
one
day
that
tomorrow
morning
get
your
things
ready,
and
he
is
taken,
a
hearing
required
in
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
take
my
hypothetical.
it
is
a
brand
new
modern,
the
most
modern
institution
of
its
kind
available.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
your
answer
is
that
they
must
have
a
hearing
in
order
to
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
going
to
do
the
balancing,
the
district
judge
or
the
warden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
the
sanction
here
--
he
corrections
board,
the
overall
supervisory
body
has
built
a
new
institution
and
they
decide
that
650
from
one
institution
must
be
moved
into
the
new
one
to
relieve
crowding,
350
from
another
and
so
on.
no
invidious
action,
no
discipline,
it
just
kind
of
moves
650
people,
is
then
a
hearing
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
following
my
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assume
hypothetically
that
the
release
of
the
information
was
stated
by
the
director
or
warden
of
the
institution
as
something
that
would
endanger
the
lives
and
safety
of
the
informants,
would
you
think
they
could
withhold
the
details
from
the
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
time
and
place
might
enable
the
subject
to
identify
the
informant
very
readily,
probably
would.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
donahue,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
mention
or
did
someone
mentioned
earlier
in
the
argument
the
figure,
the
total
number
of
transfer
in
one
year
in
massachusetts
or
was
that
in
the
other
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
total
prison
population
of
massachusetts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
total?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-520,
montanye
against
haymes,
and
75-252,
meachum
against
fano
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
