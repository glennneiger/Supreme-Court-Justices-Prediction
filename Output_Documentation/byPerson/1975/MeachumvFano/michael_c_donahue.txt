mr.
michael
c.
donahue
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
michael
donahue;
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
case
presents
a
similar
question
to
the
case
previously
argued,
it
is
somewhat
different
but
it
broadly
presents
the
question
of
whether
and
to
what
extent
procedural
requirements
for
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
extend
to
the
interstate
transfer
of
state
prisoners.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
intrastate
your
honor.
this
action
was
originally
commenced
by
17
inmates
confined
to
the
massachusetts
correctional
institute
at
norfolk.
mci-norfolk
is
a
medium
security
institution.
an
amended
complaint
was
later
filed
by
six
inmates
who
are
the
respondents
here.
they
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
pursuant
to
section
1983,
sought
money
damages
against
the
commissioner
of
correction,
the
superintendent
of
norfolk
alleging
that
hearings
that
had
been
held
transferring
them
from
norfolk
to
walpole
were
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
respondents
asked
the
district
court
to
enjoin
any
transfer
to
walpole
and
to
with
any
of
the
other
state
institutions
and
it
ordered
--
it
sought
an
order
to
the
correction
officials
to
place
the
inmates
in
the
general
population
of
norfolk.
the
chronology
of
the
case
is
briefly
as
follows:
in
november
the
case
was
filed,
the
district
judge
denied
a
temporary
restraining
order.
in
january
10,
1975,
following
argument,
the
district
judge
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
and
ordered
that
the
department
officials
submit
regulations
to
deal
with
the
question
of
hearings
that
was
--
to
deal
with
the
question
of
hearings
to
be
applied
at
mci-norfolk.
the
regulations
would
have
to
be
similar
and
to
provide
the
same
rights
to
inmates
who
are
confined
to
mci-walpole.
the
district
judge
stated
part
of
the
order,
pending
appeal.
the
full
panel
of
the
first
circuit
stated
the
remainder
of
the
auto-pending
of
full
argument
on
the
merits
to
the
full
bench
of
the
first
circuit.
in
june
last
year
the
court
of
appeals
reached
decision
affirming
the
district
court.
in
so
doing
they
held
that
the
loss
suffered
by
inmates
in
transfer
from
norfolk
to
walpole
was
sufficient
to
constitute
a
deprivation
of
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
was
a
purely
weight
analysis;
it
did
not
reach
it
in
the
first
instance
by
arguing
whether
or
not
there
was
a
liberty
of
property
interest
involved.
it
said
there
was
a
cumulative
approach
that
the
loss
suffered
by
the
inmate
on
the
transfer
from
norfolk
to
walpole
was
sufficient
to
invoke
the
procedures
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
judge
levin
campbell
of
the
first
circuit
dissented.
judge
campbell
argued
that
inmates
had
no
recognizable
interest
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
had
no
interest
in
liberty
of
property
and
remaining
at
any
particular
institution.
judge
campbell
said
in
his
dissent
that
remaining
in
the
correction
institution
in
massachusetts
was
no
more
than
a
unilateral
expectation
conditioned
by
no
act
of
the
state.
on
december
8,
1975
this
court
granted
certiorari.
in
the
fall
of
1974,
the
massachusetts
correctional
institute
at
norfolk
was
undergoing
a
series
of
significant
disruptive
incidence.
a
series
of
fires
occurred
beginning
in
august,
1974
and
continued
through
october.
there
were
nine
fires.
they
were
serious
enough
that
required
the
assistance
of
outside
fire
departments
from
the
surrounding
communities.
at
various
points,
four
of
the
surrounding
towns
sent
firefighters
in
to
engage
in
putting
out
the
blaze.
from
august
to
october
over
$
100,000
in
damages
had
occurred
within
the
institution,
two
inmate
living
units
were
burned
down,
there
was
a
partial
loss
of
the
laundry
at
the
institution.
at
some
point
on
october
the
record
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
at
some
point
in
october
in
1974,
superintendent
of
norfolk,
mr.
larry
meachum
was
informed
by
certain
inmates
at
the
institution
that
certain
other
inmates,
among
whom
are
the
respondents
here,
were
engaged
in
the
disruptive
incidents
at
the
institution.
meachum
began
to
take
action
to
cause
them
to
be
removed
from
the
general
population.
on
the
16th
of
october
he
removed
the
first
of
the
respondents.
by
the
24th
of
october
all
of
the
other
respondents
were
removed
from
the
general
population.
by
october
31st
there
were
no
further
fires
in
the
institution.
by
october
25th
each
of
the
inmates
had
received
a
notice
of
a
“discipline
hearing”,
notice
of
a
discipline
charge,
which
stated
in
general
terms
that
the
superintendent
of
the
institution
had
received
information
through
a
reliable
source
that
they
were
in
engaged
in
certain
general
conduct.
in
some
of
the
respondents’
case
it
was
that
they
had
engaged
in
setting
the
fires
or
participated
in
the
fires.
in
other
cases
it
was
alleged
that
they
were
trafficking
in
narcotics.
in
other
cases
it
was
alleged
that
they
were
--
had
possession
of
ammunition
or
weapons
within
the
institution.
the
local
district
attorney
was
informed
at
the
same
time
and
the
matter
was
referred
to
his
office
for
investigation.
specifically
because
of
the
massachusetts
correctional
procedures
which
were
enforced
at
that
time,
no
disciplinary
hearing
was
held
because
the
regulations
abide
holding
a
disciplinary
hearing,
abiding
posing
sanctions
as
a
result
of
disciplinary
punishment
when
the
matter
had
been
referred
to
the
local
district
attorney.
those
regulations
are
no
longer
in
effect.
by
early
november,
each
of
the
respondents
received
notices
of
“classification
hearings”.
the
classification
hearings
notified
them
in
general
terms
of
the
same
informant
information
that
had
been
contained
in
the
disciplinary
notices
and
it
specifically
informed
the
inmates
that
they
will
possibly
be
subject
to
transfers
to
higher
custody
status
as
a
result
of
the
classification
hearings
which
were
to
be
scheduled.
classification
in
massachusetts
determines
custody
level.
it
does
not
adjudicate
specific
instances
of
misconduct.
a
classification
board
may
review
instances
of
misconduct
or
allegations
of
misconduct,
only
insofar
as
they
relate
to
the
custody
level
at
the
institution
does
not
determine
guilt
or
innocence
on
specific
disciplinary
charges.
classification
hearings
were
scheduled
and
held
for
each
one
of
the
respondents
through
early
november
1974.
at
the
hearings
each
inmate
was
represented
by
counsel
or
represented
by
a
law
student.
each
inmate
read
a
prepared
statement
by
the
board
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
hearing,
the
powers
of
the
classification
board,
the
possibility
of
the
transfer
could
result.
i
might
add,
interject
at
this
point
-
the
hearings
were
not
held
at
the
same
day;
they
were
held
over
one
week
period
during
or
approximately
one
week
period
during
november.
following
the
statement
made
by
the
classification
board
to
the
inmate.
the
inmate
and
the
counsel
were
asked
to
leave
the
room
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
allowing
the
superintendent
to
come
in
and
testify
as
to
the
informant
information
that
he
possessed.
superintendent
came
in
the
room,
stated
times
not
reflected
by
the
record,
the
record
does
reflect,
however,
in
the
reports
of
the
classification
notices
beginning
at
page
68
of
the
appendix
that
the
board
examined
(inaudible)
to
the
sources
if
this
information.
they
probe
his
information
as
to
the
credibility
of
the
informants
and
the
reliability
of
the
information.
there
are
specific
findings
in
the
classification
reports
that
the
classification
board
found
the
information
to
be
reliable.
in
one
instance
one
of
the
respondents
was
recommended
by
a
classification
board
not
to
be
transferred.
and
then
on
a
review
by
the
commissioner
of
correction
who
has
the
ultimate
responsibility
in
massachusetts,
the
commissioner
of
correction
overruled
that
and
order
that
he
would
be
transferred.
but
i
am
moving
ahead
the
game
at
this
point.
following
meachum’s
testimony,
the
inmate,
he
was
excused,
the
inmate
was
called
back
into
the
room.
they
were
told
that
meachum
again
had
presented
informant
information.
in
no
instances
it
appeared
that
the
board
summarized
the
information
for
the
inmate,
the
position
that
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
to
the
district
court
in
an
affidavit
by
meachum
was
that
meachum’s
judgment
was
that
it
would
compromise
the
safety
and
security
of
the
informant.
there
is
other
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
classification
reports
that
the
classification
board
felt
that
to
reveal
any
more
of
the
information
and
meachum
--
to
the
inmate
than
the
general
charges
would
have
compromised
the
safety
and
the
security
of
the
informants.
the
inmate
was
allowed
to
present
any
testimony
he
wish.
he
was
not
given
a
compulsory
process.
he
was
not
allowed
to
compel
the
presence
of
corrections
offices.
he
was
allowed
to
compel
the
--
he
was
allowed
to
submit
documentary
evidence.
the
record
reflects
that
certain
of
the
respondents’
submitted
documentary
evidence
from
individuals
they
worked
for
at
the
institution.
the
record
reflects
that
certain
of
the
respondents
were
allowed
--
requested
and
were
allowed
and
did
present
corrections
offices
to
testify.
the
board
heard
from
the
social
workers
in
each
case
who
testified
as
to
the
institutional
history
or
of
the
respondents,
they
testified
as
to
their
criminal
history,
and
the
board
had
a
full
view
of
what
the
inmates’
conduct
had
been
in
the
institution.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
no.
i
do
not,
your
honor,
no.
i
do
not.
i
am
going
into
detail
in
the
facts
because
i
think
they
are
crucial
and
because
it
is
not
the
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
well
because
the
position
of
the
commonwealth,
the
position
of
my
clients
has
been
throughout
--
hearings
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
in
correction
practice.
in
this
instance
hearings
were
held
because
my
clients
regarded
them
as
a
useful
tool
in
corrections
practice.
we
do
not,
however,
think
that
they
are
constitutionally
required,
because
we
do
not
think
in
this
instance
that
there
was
any
state
created
interest
sufficient
to
create
a
liberty
of
property
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
existence
of
hearings
in
the
provision
for
hearings
is
not
necessarily
a
question
which
implicates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
do
not
concede
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
hearings
to
be
held.
following
the
hearings
the
board
orally
announced
its
recommendations
to
counsel
and
to
the
inmate.
they
informed
them
that
what
their
recommendations
would
have
been
--
they
informed
the
board
what
its
recommendations
would
have
been.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
board’s
decision
ultimately
was
raised,
made,
they
made
only
recommendations.
there
was
no
ultimate
decision
made
by
the
board.
the
power
to
transfer
in
massachusetts
is
vested
in
the
commissioner
of
correction.
at
page
6a
of
the
respondents’
brief,
the
massachusetts
statute
is
contained.
there
were
no
standards
implied;
it
just
indicates
that
the
commissioner
may
transfer
an
inmate
in
his
discretion.
so
what
the
board
did
in
this
instance
was
made
a
factual
findings
and
give
recommendations
to
the
commissioner
who
then
proceeded
to
act.
because
there
were
no
statutes
or
because
there
were
no
regulations
which
give
substantive
standards
to
the
transfer
of
question,
it
is
--
the
petitioners’
position
is
that
there
is
no
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
for
an
inmate
to
remain
in
the
correctional
institution.
and
that
any
inmate’s
desire
to
remain
at
that
institution
is
therefore
conditioned
by
no
act
of
the
state.
the
desire
to
remain
in
the
institution
is
nothing
more
than
a
unilateral
expectation.
the
commissioner’s
decision
is
entirely
discretionary.
moreover,
it
is
important
to
focus
i
think
on
the
question
as
to
what
this
board
did
even
if
due
process
is
found
to
apply.
what
this
board
did
was
not
adjudicate
misconduct.
what
the
board
did
was
only
determined
the
question
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
these
inmates
remaining
at
norfolk
in
a
situation
which
in
the
superintendent’s
judgment
was
untenable.
if
due
process
applies
in
the
first
instance
we
suggest
this
is
crucial
because
they
did
not
determine
misconduct.
these
inmates
were
not
punished.
at
least
they
were
not
objectively
punished.
the
gravity
of
the
loss
that
the
inmates
suffered
is,
in
our
judgment,
no
more
significant
in
the
loss
suffered
by
the
teacher
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth.
his
subjective
perception
may
have
been
lost
but
there
was
nothing
in
an
objective
standard
which
we
suggest
that
the
court
could
base
the
decision
saying
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right.
these
inmates
were
not
committed
to
segregation
at
walpole,
they
suffered
no
loss
of
good
time,
they
were
not
branded
as
troublemakers
as
the
court
of
appeals
found.
they
were,
they
did
have
notations
entered
in
an
institutional
record
but
that
was
the
only
thing.
to
derive
injury
from
the
mere
entry
to
the
notation
is
a
very
speculative
type
of
approach
in
due
process,
and
we
think
that
this
court’s
opinion
at
least
recently
in
paul
versus
davis
recognized
that
the
stigma
or
unless
there
is
an
independent
liberty
of
property
interest
is
not
a
cognizable.
the
quarrel
that
we
have
with
the
first
circuit’s
opinion
exists
because
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
require
us
to
give
information
which
in
our
judgment
would
have
revealed
the
identity
of
the
informants.
that
is
the
crux
of
the
matter
before
the
court
on
the
question
of
whether
the
process
was
adequate,
if
indeed
process
is
found.
a
summary
of
the
evidence
could
have
revealed
the
names
and
the
identity
of
the
informants
and
it
was
the
only
procedure
in
fact
that
was
abbreviated
by
my
clients.
we
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
procedures
that
were
followed
in
the
hearings
were
consistent
with
this
court’s
interpretation
of
wolff
that
when
institutional
security
was
implicated
there
were
certain
matters
that
might
be
excluded
from
the
information
given
to
the
inmate.
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument
and
they
said
that
it
was
--
that
quite
frankly
that
the
language
that
this
court
have
used
was
cryptic.
we
did
not
find
anything
cryptic
about
it.
the
language
in
wolff
we
thought
gave
the
department
the
right
to
exclude
summaries
of
evidence
when,
in
their
judgment,
there
would
have
compromise
the
safety
and
security
of
the
informants.
the
record
at
least
says
to
the
finding
of
the
classification
boards
is
clear
on
that
question.
there
was
no
question
in
the
minds
of
the
superintendent,
there
appears
to
have
been
no
question
in
the
minds
of
the
classification
committee
that
it
give
the
inmates
a
summary
of
the
evidence
would
have
compromised
their
safety.
if
due
process
is
to
serve
in
this
instance,
two
purposes
that
may
very
well
assert
to
accurately
ascertain
facts.
we
contend
that
it
was
done.
there
was
no
procedure
that
this
court
would
follow
which
compromise
the
accurate
identification
of
facts.
the
procedure
that
the
board
followed
insofar
as
the
purpose
was
to
accurately
ascertain
facts
was
adequate.
in
terms
of
allowing
the
inmate
to
testify,
to
have
an
input
in
its
decision,
we
believe
that
was
also
adequate.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
inmates
in
these
cases
because
they
were
represented
by
counsel,
because
they
were
allowed
to
call
witnesses,
because
they
were
allowed
to
present
documentary
evidence,
had
anything
but
a
fully
input
into
the
factual
considerations
by
the
board.
this
may
not
be
necessarily
have
been
the
case
if
we
were
adjudicating
a
specific
instance
of
punishment,
but
we
were
not
adjudicating
specific
instance
of
punishment.
the
board
was
not
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
individuals
are
involved
in
the
setting
of
fires.
the
only
question
before
the
board
was
the
propriety
of
these
inmates
whom
the
superintendent
believed
to
have
been
involved,
was
the
propriety
of
these
inmates
remaining
at
the
institution
in
norfolk.
this
case,
we
suggest,
really
presents
the
question
of
where
balance
ought
to
be
struck
in
prison
situations,
the
balance
that
was
noted
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
between
the
need
for
institutional
security
and
the
right
to
protect
individuals.
in
this
instance
we
believe
what
judge
campbell
in
his
dissenting
opinion
that
the
states
interest
is
paramount,
the
states
interest
is
so
important
in
instances
of
this
nature,
that
the
court
should
properly
strike
the
balance
in
our
favor.
we
are
not
trying
to
limit
the
right
to
hearing.
in
massachusetts,
hearings
are
held
for
virtually
every
conceivable
administrative
purpose.
prior
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
the
record
reflects
that
massachusetts
had
promulgated
disciplinary
procedures
which
granted
procedures
in
excess
of
what
this
court
constitutionally
mandated
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell.
classification
regulations
in
its
full
sense
were
issued
later.
every
procedure
dealing
with
transfer,
every
procedure
dealing
with
discipline
is
covered
under
massachusetts
regulations.
there
are
no
standards.
we
do
not
think
that
they
create
an
entitlement
by
that,
by
the
existence
of
the
regulations.
but
the
procedures
in
massachusetts
--
the
massachusetts
prison
system
was
followed
to
allow
a
hearing
in
virtually
every
conceivable
limitation.
so
that
is
not
really
the
question
before
the
court,
the
question
is
not
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
limit
the
right
of
hearings
and
to
taking
unilateral
and
arbitrary
action.
that
is
simply
not
presented
by
the
case.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
to
be
consistent,
yes
your
honor,
that
is
true.
yes,
i
believe
so.
as
i
mentioned
earlier
though
our
judgment
is
that
what
is
mandated
by
good
correctional
practice
and
what
is
mandated
by
a
sound
administrative
judgment,
it
is
not
necessarily
required
by
the
constitution.
we
may
by
virtue
of
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
absolutely,
yes.
opposition
is
that
while
a
hearing
may
be
necessary
it
may
be
wise
in
specific
instances
that
it
is
not,
it
is
not
necessarily
mandated
in
this
case.
if
we
create
a
system
of
regulations
which
play
substantive
standards
on
the
conduct
of
the
individuals
we
may
create
an
entitlement.
but
this
record
does
not
reflect
that
any
entitlement
was
created.
this
record
only
reflects
that
inmates
were
transferred
from
one
institution
to
another
and
suffered
some
deprivation
as
a
result
of
that.
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
sufficient
to
invoke
the
procedural
requirements
of
due
process.
if
it
is
entitlement,
if
it
is
board
of
regents
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
yes
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
absolutely,
yes
sir.
if
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
no
your
honor.
there
is
not.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
we
believe
it
springs
from
the
regulations
your
honor.
it
is
an
entitlement,
it
is
a
state
created
interest.
whether
it
is
a
liberty
type
interest
such
was
involved
in
the
nebraska
procedures
in
wolff
that
the
statutory
creation
of
good
time
or
whether
it
is
the
example
that
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
as
to
transferring
only
from
misconduct,
and
that
is
a
different
question
and
we
believe
that
the
state
has
created
the
right
rather
than
something
that
is
inherit
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
i
do
not
believe
it
is
inherent
in
the
constitution
your
honor.
if
regulations
exist
so
as
to
premise
the
transfer
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
no
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
no
independent
liberty
interest
springing
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
that
type
of
situation.
it
may
well
implicate
as
you
say
the
eighth
amendment
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
the
question
of
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
what
we
believe
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
in
the
instances
is,
well
excuse
me
let
me
back
up
on
that.
we
believe
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
are
very
limited
inherent
rights
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
what
exists
we
believe
from
this
court’s
decision
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth,
from
perry
versus
sindermann,
through
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
and
goss
versus
lopez
is
a
recognition
that
certain
due
process
rights
are
created
and
are
conditioned
by
the
state.
but
there
are
other
due
process
rights
which
are
not
inherent
in
the
constitution.
there
are
other
rights
that
are
all
ready
inherent
in
the
constitution
such
as
the
inmates’
right
in
procunier
versus
martinez
which
is
something
that
was
inherent
rather
than
springing
from
the
state’s
created
interest.
the
thrust
of
our
position
is
that
due
process
must
have
am
objective
reference
point.
it
must
contain
some
limiting
principle.
due
process
in
order
to
be
understood
and
applied
consistently
must
mean
more
than
what
a
particular
district
judge
says
it
means
at
any
particular
moment.
it
must
have
a
point
of
reference
to
which
all
individuals,
all
citizens
and
all
governmental
agencies
can
say
that
apply.
it
cannot
exist
by
virtue
of
a
weighed
interest
or
a
weighed
analysis
where
one
single
judge
will
say
that
because
of
this
cumulation
of
deprivations
we
believe
that
due
process
has
to
apply.
we
think
such
an
approach
is
inconsistent
with
this
court’s
analysis
in
board
of
regents
versus
roth,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
court’s
analysis
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell,
and
we
strongly
believe
that
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here.
they
cumulated
the
deprivations
that
the
inmate
was
to
suffer
upon
transfer
and
they
said
therefore
due
process
applies.
we
think
that
is
an
improper
approach
to
defining
whether
a
liberty
of
property
interest
excess
and
for
that
basis
we
are
asking
that
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
well
actually
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
it
cannot
happen
in
massachusetts
your
honor.
the
hypothetical
you
raised
cannot
happen.
disciplinary
boards
in
massachusetts
cannot
transfer.
disciplinary
boards
can
only
recommend
transfer
to
classification
board.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
and
neither
did
the
board
adjudicate
the
specific
question
of
misconduct.
it
only
determined
whether
or
not
the
inmate
could
appropriately
remain
at
the
institution.
there
has
never
been
an
adjudication
in
this
case
of
whether
these
inmates
did
what
the
informants
said
they
would
to
do.
in
my
client’s
judgment
that
was
not
the
crucial
question.
the
crucial
and
the
most
overwriting
question
from
the
state’s
point
of
view
was
to
remove
this
people
from
the
situation
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
from
a
strict
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
there
is.
there
was
a
stipulation
of
fact
entered
in
the
district
court
that
notation
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
it
is
conceivable.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
no
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
yes.
i
think
there
he
is.
i
think
they
are
independent
questions
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
is
involved
is
an
adjudication
of
misconduct
in
one
instance
for
which
the
inmate
is
punished,
objectively
punished,
segregation,
loss
of
good
time.
and
the
other
instance
if
the
department
chooses
not
to
punish
him
but
rather
to
remove
him
from
the
source
of
his
difficulty,
i
think
it
is
a
different
question.
with
the
court’s
permission
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
two
brief
points.
the
possibility
of
a
transfer
occurring
for
disciplinary
measures
is
somewhat
ambiguous
in
the
record.
the
sanctions
that
may
be
imposed
by
the
disciplinary
regulations
which
appear
in
this
record
include
transfer
as
a
possible
sanction.
that
is
not
the
practice
in
massachusetts.
first
of
all,
because
those
regulations
are
no
longer
in
effect
and
second
of
all
it
was
never
the
practice
of
the
disciplinary
board
to
transfer.
it
only
recommended
transfer
as
to
the
classification
board.
i
would
like
to
address
the
point
that
mr.
shapiro
raised
concerning
the
inmate’s
interest
in
remaining
in
the
institution.
as
mr.
jones
pointed
out,
all
of
these
inmates
in
this
instance
were
sentenced
to
mci-walpole
prior
to
being
transferred
for
whatever
reason
to
mci-norfolk.
no
reason
apparent
in
the
record
why
any
of
these
inmates
were
sent
to
norfolk.
transfers
occur
in
massachusetts
for
a
myriad
of
reasons.
they
may
occur
because
of
population
control.
they
may
occur
simply
because
of
program
availability.
they
may
--
excuse
me.
for
certain
matters
in
massachusetts
they
may
occur
because
of
the
hospital
at
norfolk
is
regarded
as
significantly
better
than
the
hospital
in
walpole.
inmates
who
have
medical
problems
may
be
sent
to
norfolk.
it
does
not
depend
on
the
behavior.
it
is
not
predicated
upon
their
behavior.
there
may
be
general
instances
where
an
inmate
will
be
transferred
to
norfolk
for
behavior,
but
there
is
no
indication
in
record
of
this
case
that
any
of
these
inmates
were
sent
to
norfolk
because
they
were
better
behaved
than
other
inmates
who
remained
at
walpole.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
i
believe
that
might
have
been
the
other
case
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
such
statistics
are
available.
and
in
anyway,
in
any
event
i
think
it
will
be
significantly
less
because
there
are
approximately
2,700
inmates
in
massachusetts.
the
institutions
at
norfolk
and
walpole
are
only
approximately
one
mile
part
so
there
would
not
probably
be
any
significant
disruption
of
the
administrative
process,
and
we
do
not
contend
that
that
would
be
the
case
here.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
approximately
2,700
your
honor.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
donahue
your
honor
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
notice
was
inadequate
because
it
did
not
state
the
time
and
place
of
the
hearings.
my
brother
said
that
was
not
presented.
the
district
court
--
the
district
court’s
rulings
include
a
reference
to
the
defendants
asserting
that
to
give
such
notice
would
have
compromised
the
safety
of
the
informants.
it
was
my
client’s
position
that
any
further
notice,
any
further
detail
would
have
seriously
compromised
the
safety
of
the
informant.
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
in
earlier
in
a
question,
in
norfolk
which
is
an
open
institution
where
inmates
roam
generally
at
will
there
would
have
been
a
great
deal
of
probability
that
giving
the
time
and
place
of
the
offense
that
they
were
charging,
the
informant
could
have
been
identified.
thank
you.
