mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners’
argument
ignores
the
four
critical
facts
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
decisions
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
upholding
the
prisoners’
claims.
first
of
all,
the
close
relationship
of
this
case
to
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
a
disciplinary
process
was
initiated
in
this
case.
this
demonstrates
that
there
was
a
recognition
on
the
part
of
prison
officials
that
there
were
historical
facts
at
controversy
and
that
there
was
a
violation
of
a
regulation
at
stake.
in
addition,
transfer,
as
appears
on
page
117
of
the
appendix,
is
a
possible
sanction
for
major
misconduct
in
the
walpole
prison
system,
in
the
massachusetts
prison
system,
pardon
me.
second,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
massachusetts
has
deliberately
differentiated
the
institutions
within
the
state.
and
it
has
provided
graduated
conditions
of
confinement
in
the
various
institutions.
this
has
a
definite
and
real
meaning
to
the
legal
conclusions
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court.
in
massachusetts,
there
is
a
system
of
prisons
ranging
from
maximum
through
medium,
minimum,
halfway
houses,
pre-release
centers,
a
variety
of
institutions
with
different
physical
conditions
of
confinement,
different
custody
controls,
different
restrictions
on
movement
and
different
opportunities
for
programs.
the
purpose
as
conceded
by
the
massachusetts
correctional
authorities
is
to
avow
inmates
whose
conduct
demonstrates
that
they
are
able
to
function
in
a
responsible
fashion
to
have
fewer
bodily
restraints
placed
upon
them
and
to
have
a
greater
opportunity
to
participate
in
programs.
similarly
by
avowing
fewer
bodily
restraints
placed
upon
the
inmate
by
avowing
them
to
have
a
greater
opportunity
to
participate
in
programs
perhaps
work
in
the
community
part
of
the
day,
perhaps
go
out
into
the
community
on
furloughs
which
are
limited
passes.
it
indicates
to
parole
board
when
they
consider
this
inmate
for
release
on
parole
that
he
or
she
has
demonstrated
responsibility
in
their
actions
and
an
ability
to
function
in
society
as
determined
by
prison
officials
and
the
placement
of
this
person
within
the
prison
system,
suggest
the
converse
in
true
when
a
person
is
placed
in
a
more
restrictive
condition
of
confinement.
at
the
same
types
of
concerns
are
reflected
by
the
parole
board
that
the
prison
officials
had
already
made
some
judgment
about
the
responsibility
of
this
person
and
the
ability
to
function
in
the
society.
within
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
it
flows
independently
from
the
–
any
of
liberty
interest
in
the
anticipation
of
parole.
the
analogy
that
the
court
of
appeals
drew
between
this
court
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
is
similar
to
the
argument
presented
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
that
is
the
massachusetts
had
no
obligation
to
create
a
system
of
confinement
whether
or
deliberate
differentiations
amongst
the
institutions
whether
graduated
conditions
of
confinement.
but
once
having
done
so
and
once
having
demonstrated
in
this
case
that
the
withdrawal
of
those
conditions
is
related
and
the
additional
restrictions
upon
liberty
are
related
to
allegations
of
serious
misconduct
than
at
least
the
liberty
interest
of
the
due
process
clause
as
recognized
in
wolff
is
implicated.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor
there
is
an
independent
liberty
interest
that
petitioners
--
that
respondents
assert
in
this
case.
there
is
a
liberty
interest
which
flows
from
the
constitutional
concept
of
liberty,
the
factual
restraints
upon
liberty,
the
closer
controls.
in
wolff,
the
court
recognized
that
even
if
liberty
is
state
created
that
this
liberty
is
protected
by
the
due
process
clause.
the
clause
--
the
court
did
not
have
to
face
the
question
that
is
precisely
faced
in
this
case
as
to
the
physical,
factual
restrictions
on
bodily
movements.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
if
there
is
an
adverse
change
in
conditions
of
confinement
then
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
the
liberty
interest
would
be
implicated.
the
question
would
still
remain
as
to
what
processes
do.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
it
would
depend
upon
the
particular
circumstances
as
to
whether
the
change
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
that
there
may
be
in
that
case
if
there
are
not
sufficient
deprivations,
it
may
fall
into
the
range
of
lesser
privileges
that
were
discussed
but
not
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell.
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
situation.
it
is
not
the
case
where
there
is
a
transfer
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--
to
more
adverse
conditions
of
confinement.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
because
a
transfer
implicates
the
nature,
severity
and
possible
length
of
incarceration.
it
operates
as
an
immediate
physical
change
in
the
restraints
upon
the
inmate.
it
disrupts
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor,
i
am
not
saying
that
in
an
appropriate
case
that
that
may
not
constitute
adverse
change
in
conditions
of
confinement.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
case
is
even
more
compelling
and
you
do
not
have
to
reach
the
issue
faced
by
more
limited
restrictions
on
a
person’s
liberty.
within
the
scheme
--
within
the
massachusetts
prison
system
scheme
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
i
was
suggesting
that
it
may
implicate
liberty
but
it
may
not
be
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
it
may
still
be
a
de
minimis
loss,
yes
your
honor.
and
that
is
why
an
evaluation
of
the
particular
circumstances
is
necessary.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
again
your
honor,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
but
in
the
appropriate
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
what
i
am
suggesting
is
when
there
are
changes
in
the
actual
physical
fact
of
liberty.
the
actual
movement,
the
actual
bodily
restraints
then
the
liberty
interest
may
be
implicated
if
in
your
hypothetical
your
honor
there
would
be
none
of
those
changes
to
begin
with.
that
it
would
just
function
as
a
change
in
just
the
lighting
it
may
be
that
that
would
again
fall
within
the
category
of
de
minimis
losses
although
if
it
restricts
the
movement
of
the
inmate
the
ability
to
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
that
would
implicate
the
liberty
interest
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
appropriate
circumstances
it
may
not
a
de
minimis
loss
and
it
may
still
require
some
procedure
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor,
again
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
the
crux
of
our
argument
is
that
when
allegations
of
serious
misconduct
are
at
issue
and
the
liberty
interest
is
implicated,
there
is
a
need
for
the
minimal
due
process
provided
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell.
but
in
a
situation
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
what
i
was
suggesting
your
honor
is
that
even
if
the
liberty
interest
of
a
group
is
implicated
there
is
still
the
question
of
what
procedures
are
appropriate.
and
beyond
the
question
of
allegations
of
misconduct
there
may
be
lesser
procedures
than
those
required
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell,
but
those
procedures
are
necessary
to
insure
that
the
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause
are
fulfilled
in
the
individual
case.
in
our
case
though
we
have
situations
where
there
were
allegations
of
serious
misconduct
against
individual
prison
inmates.
there
was
no
determination
made
with
respect
to
any
larger
group.
it
focused
on
individual
conduct.
within
the
scheme,
the
general
scheme
that
i
have
already
discussed
in
massachusetts,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
this
is
a
finding
of
fact
of
the
district
court
that
can
find
that
the
conditions
of
confinement
at
walpole
and
bridgewater
are
substantially
more
adverse
than
those
at
norfolk.
and
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals
and
district
court
recognized
that
this
implicated
the
basic
values
of
liberty.
the
external
restraints
on
bodily
movement
were
increased
as
a
result
of
their
transfer
from
norfolk
to
walpole
and
bridgewater,
there
were
stricter
security,
closer
custody,
fewer
programs
and
it
was
difficult
to
obtain
furloughs,
work
release,
educational
release
and
other
rehabilitative
opportunities.
this
is
fundamentally
important
because
it
demonstrates
that
the
ability
of
the
inmate
to
assert
his
responsibility
to
demonstrate
his
ability
to
function
in
society
is
minimized
and
reduced
as
he
is
moved
back
into
the
system
through
--
into
higher
custody
levels
and
that
will
effect
all
of
the
future
decisions
which
are
made
about
this
inmate
and
could
follow
the
inmate
throughout
his
entire
term
of
incarceration.
this
possibility
is
made
more
certain
by
the
fact
that
in
the
present
case
the
defendants
have
stipulated,
that
there
was
a
notation
in
the
file
and
that
this
notation
did
indicate
the
reason,
the
fact
of
the
transfer
and
the
reasons
for
he
transfer.
and
that
was
noted
in
the
file
and
will
be
considered
by
future
agencies
within
the
department
of
corrections
and
ultimately
by
the
parole
board.
now
with
this
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
we
are
not
arguing
that
there
is
any
liberty
interest
in
parole.
we
are
arguing
that
the
liberty
interest
of
an
inmate
who
is
transferred
involves
not
only
the
possible
impositions
of
sanctions
as
a
result
of
a
notation
in
the
file
but
also
immediate
disruptive
severe
changes
in
the
nature
and
seriousness
in
conditions
of
confinement.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
it
recognizes
your
honor,
first
of
all
that
within
the
prison
system
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
reputation,
that
is
the
issue
as
was
stated
in
paul
versus
davis,
it
is
a
question
of
whether
all
the
future
decisions
that
will
effect
the
quality,
length
and
severity
of
an
inmate’s
incarceration
will
be
based
on
erroneous
information
and
that
is
a
present
interest
in
the
inmate.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
it
demonstrates
the
court’s
concern
in
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
with
the
collateral
consequences
that
could
follow
from
a
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
of
the
perceived
charge
in
the
prison
system.
it
again
--
it
just
emphasizes
the
seriousness
of
the
affects
of
this
determination
upon
the
inmate.
and
therefore
it
demonstrates
that
are
collateral
and
future
consequences,
as
well
as
immediate
direct
consequences
on
the
inmate’s
conditions
of
confinement
and
his
liberty.
now
with
this
factual
background
which
was
duly
noted
by
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
there
are
two
separate
inquiries
before
the
court,
whether
the
due
process
clause
is
applicable
in
the
instant
circumstances
and
what
procedures
are
required.
the
court
of
appeals
first
of
all
read
wolff
as
implicating
liberty
interest
in
two
respects.
in
one
respect
there
are
the
external
physical
restraints
upon
bodily
movement
which
were
not
discussed
in
wolff
but
which
are
present
in
a
transfer
to
more
adverse
conditions
of
confinement.
the
court
recognize
that
this
implicated
the
liberty
interest
and
then
considered
whether
there
was
--
they
were
certain
and
serious
enough
to
implicate
the
liberty
cause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
found
that
the
adverse
change
in
conditions
of
confinement
based
on
the
factual
record
in
this
case
had
severe,
abrupt,
immediate
and
comprehensive
effects
on
the
prisoners’
limited
liberty.
there
were
additional
bodily
restraints
placed
on
the
inmate
and
several
other
instance
of
transfer
which
affected
the
nature,
severity
and
possibly
the
length
of
his
incarceration.
this
direct
and
immediate
losses
are
identical
to,
if
not
more
serious
than
those
already
recognized
in
wolff.
good
time
the
court
recognized
and
wolff
has
a
future
effect
and
may
be
restored.
a
transfer
represents
an
immediate
disruptive
effect
on
all
of
the
conditions
of
confinement
of
the
inmate.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor
in
that
situation
liberty
interest
would
be
implicated
if
there
is
an
adverse
change
in
conditions
of
confinement.
it
is
not
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
as
the
first
circuit
has
recognized
there
are
disruptions
inherent
in
transfer.
there
is
a
discontinuation
of
programs.
there
are
changes
in
the
inmate’s
daily
life
which
effect
all
aspects.
so
in
case
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no
your
honor.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
liberty
clause
is
implicated.
now
the
appropriate
procedures
that
may
be
required
in
those
circumstances
depend
on
balancing
the
interest
and
if
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
i
would
suggest
that
when
allegations
of
serious
misconduct
are
not
of
issue
your
honor,
balancing
can
be
left
in
the
first
instance,
as
this
court
recognized
in
wolff,
to
the
sound
discretion
of
correctional
officials.
so
long
as
they
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause,
which
are
to
protect
the
individual
against
arbitrary
action
of
the
government
and
to
insure
that
determinations
are
made
on
the
basis
of
reliable
information
for
imposition
of
the
sanction
which
in
this
case
is
a
transfer.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
if
the
determinations
are
based
on
allegations
of
individual
conduct,
a
hearing
of
individual
misbehavior
or
misconduct,
the
hearing
is
necessary
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
if
it
is
--
in
the
situation
where
there
is
a
selection
of
inmates
some
lesser
--
the
liberty
interest
is
still
implicated.
the
question
is
still
what
procedures
are
appropriate
in
those
circumstances,
and
it
may
be
based
on
those
circumstances
that
some
lesser
procedures
are
appropriate
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause
in
those
circumstances.
i
would
suggest
that
a
checklist
might
be
provided,
informal
consultation,
other
types
of
means
of
an
opportunity
for
the
inmate
to
submit
facts
to
the
correctional
authorities.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor
as
both
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
noted
there
was
an
inadequate
notice
under
the
standards
in
wolff.
once
the
liberty
interest
is
implicated
as
we
suggested
due
process
procedures
must
be
applied.
in
cases
where
the
allegations
are
serious
misbehavior
and
are
no
different
than
those
that
were
considered
by
the
court
in
wolff
then
the
same
minimal
due
process
procedures
are
required.
in
this
case
note
the
notice
that
not
even
state
the
time
and
place
of
the
alleged
offense
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
the
inmates
knew
when
the
hearing
would
be
held
but
they
did
not
know
anything
about
the
time
or
place
of
the
conduct
charged
in
the
notices
of
the
classification
hearing.
that
was
the
failure
to
follow
minimal
due
process
that
was
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
then
became
a
hollow
ritual
your
honor,
because
the
inmates
did
not
know
what
they
were
supposed
to
defend
themselves
against
what
charges
they
appeared
primarily
with
character
witnesses
because
they
had
no
idea
how
to
deal
with
the
allegations
of
misconduct.
they
only
suggest
that
in
these
circumstances
the
hearing
requirements
to
consider
allegations
of
serious
misconduct
did
not
even
provide
the
minimal
due
process
requirements
recognized
by
this
court
in
wolff.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
provided
that
a
summary
of
the
information
which
gave
the
inmates
some
idea
of
the
conduct
that
was
charged,
yes
the
hearings
would
have
been
adequate
because
then
the
inmate
would
have
had
n
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
response
to
the
charges.
in
this
case
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
was
meaningless
because
the
inmate
was
not
even
aware
of
the
charges.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor
that
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
that
was
never
presented
as
an
evidentiary
matter.
it
was
never
suggested
even
to
the
classification
board.
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
record
reflects
that
the
classification
board
has
never
considered
whether
the
release
of
any
of
the
informant
information
would
endanger
the
informants.
at
the
district
court
level
there
was
no
indication
that
the
release
of
the
time
and
place
of
the
alleged
offense,
that
minimal
amount
of
information
to
avow
the
inmate
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
would
in
any
way
endanger
the
security
of
the
institution.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor,
a
heavy
burden
would
be
placed
upon
them
in
that
case.
i
would
say
no,
they
could
not
withhold
basic
information
such
as
the
time
and
place
of
the
alleged
offense
or
else
they
would
erode
all
of
the
minimal
due
process
procedures
recognized
in
wolff,
but
--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
if
at
point
your
honor,
the
heavy
burden
would
be
placed
upon
correctional
officials
to
demonstrate
why
minimal
due
process
procedures
in
wolff
should
be
eroded
in
the
instant
circumstances.
that
is
not
the
situation
in
our
case
because
in
our
case
there
was
a
regulation
in
effect
at
walpole
which
was
a
maximum
security
prison
which
indicated
that
a
release
of
summary
of
informant
information
was
appropriate
and
consistent
with
correctional
goals
and
would
not
--
and
this
reflects
the
sound
discretion
of
correctional
administrators
that
a
release
in
massachusetts
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
legitimate
correctional
goals,
absent
any
demonstration
on
the
record
by
the
prison
officials
in
this
case.
why
that
regulation
should
not
have
been
followed
or
why
the
minimal
due
process
procedures
in
wolff
should
not
have
been
followed,
they
failed
to
meet
their
burden.
and
in
other
case
they
would
still
have
that
burden
but
perhaps
they
could
meet
it.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no.
there
is
nothing
that
i
am
aware
of
either
in
massachusetts
or
in
the
federal
system
that
provides
that
information
or
provides
information
about
how
many
higher
custody
transfers
may
have
been
voluntary
transfers
and
may
not
have
involved
any
disputes
of
allegations
of
misconduct
or
any
disputed
facts
and
the
inmate
just
merely
wanted
a
transfer.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes
your
honor.
but
in
an
exceptional
case
there
might
be
movement
to
higher
classification
to
be
closer
to
relatives
or
closer
to
family.
and
those
--
the
statistics
do
not
reveal
any
of
that
information
at
all.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
in
summary
with
respect
to
the
interest
implicated
the
prisoners
maintained
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest
which
flows
because
from
the
constitution
which
resulted
from
the
external
bodily
restraints
upon
the
prisoner’s
and
the
closer
custody
and
conditions
of
confinement
that
secondarily
within
massachusetts,
because
of
a
deliberate
differentiation
of
conditions
of
confinement,
because
of
the
graduated
conditions
of
confinement
there
is
a
liberty
interest
in
effect
state
created
as
in
wolff
and
very
similar
to
the
creation
of
good
time
credits
in
wolff,
which
is
implicated
by
the
transfer.
and
as
we
have
argued
in
our
there
is
also
a
property
interest
which
is
implicated
in
this
case
and
because
of
the
particular
statutes
and
administrative
regulations
in
massachusetts.
there
are
two
points
that
deserve
emphasis
your
honor
in
conclusion.
one
is
that
a
hearing
in
these
circumstances
is
necessary
to
insure
that
there
is
a
reliable
determination
of
the
disputed
facts.
minimal
due
process
procedures
in
this
case
will
not
impinge
at
all
on
the
appropriate
good
faith
exercise
of
administrative
discretion.
once
the
facts
have
been
reliably
found,
then
the
correctional
officials
will
be
free
to
exercise
their
discretion.
in
the
case
where
allegations
of
serious
misconduct
are
at
issue,
this
court
has
already
recognized
that
the
need
for
minimal
due
process
procedures
is
evident,
and
that
in
similar
situations
when
transfer
results
in
the
same
deprivations
the
need
is
no
less.
the
prison
officials
in
addition
concede
in
their
argument
that
prison
officials
have
no
interest
enacting
arbitrary
and
capriciously.
and
a
hearing
in
these
circumstances
would
insure
that
their
discretion
is
exercised
appropriately
and
on
the
basis
of
facts
reliably
found.
the
petitioner
--
the
prisoner’s
claim,
pardon
me
your
honors,
is
grounded
in
considerations
already
have
reflected
in
wolff.
prisoners
do
retain
a
residuum
of
liberty,
a
limited
liberty.
when
this
is
interfered
with,
the
due
process
clause
is
implicated.
when
allegations
of
misconduct
are
at
issue
minimal
due
process
procedures
are
necessary
to
insure
a
reliable
determination
of
fact.
other
circumstances
not
presented
by
allegations
of
misconduct
and
not
presented
in
the
instant
case,
other
transfer
circumstances
where
liberty
interests
are
implicated
may
be
left
to
the
sound
discretion
of
prison
officials
to
forge
appropriate
procedures
based
on
the
individual
circumstances
so
long
as
these
procedures
insure
that
the
lofty
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause
are
maintained
in
the
prisons
of
this
country.
thank
you.
