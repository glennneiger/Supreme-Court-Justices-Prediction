mr.

there
was
a

here
in
what

do
you
consider
it
deficient?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
any
of
those
questions
that
they
knew
when
the
hearing
would
be
held?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
notices
had
replied
with
the
requirements
you
have
just
described
with
the
hearings
otherwise
that
would
be
adequate.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
donahue,
you
had
comment
on
the
adequacy
of
the
notice
here.
i
know
you
can
â€“
i
know
you
suggest
that
no
hearing
at
all
was
necessary,
but
assuming
a
hearing
was
necessary,
what
do
you
say
about
the
notice?
