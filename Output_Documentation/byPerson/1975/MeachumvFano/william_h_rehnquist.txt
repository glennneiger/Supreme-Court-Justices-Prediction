justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
massachusetts
passes
a
statute
that
says,
walpole
is
from
now
on
not
a
penal
institution
but
we
think
it
is
just
damn
good
experience
for
all
our
citizens
to
spend
a
year
there.
and
so
from
now
on
by
lottery
every
child
born
after
this
date
will
be
sent
a
particular
time
to
walpole.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
factual
law
celebrity,
even
though
the
man
had
no
expectancy
of
staying
out
at
walpole.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
quite
a
different
basis
for
finding
a
liberty
interest
than
wolff
found
where
the
statute
conferred
good
time
credits
in
the
conditions
on
which
they
should
be
taken
away.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay,
supposing
a
man
stays
at
walpole
but
they
have
had
a
bad
time
at
walpole,
so
they
decide
that
instead
of
getting
one
hour
of
exercise
in
the
afternoon,
you
are
only
going
to
get
half
an
hour,
you
are
only
going
to
get
two
meals
a
day,
the
whole
population.
now,
under
your
theory
i
suppose
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
they
would
have
be
entitled
to
some
process
on
hypothesis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
have
given
you
the
particular
circumstances.
what
is
your
answer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
the
transfer
by
itself
different
from
simply
creating
adverse
--
more
adverse
conditions
of
confinement
in
the
same
institution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
does
my
hypothesis.
it
operates
as
an
immediate
physical
change
on
the
restraint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
why
the
parole
board
could
not
consider
total
hearsay
when
it
decides
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
man
parole?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
do
you
add
when
you
say
it
also
means
a
notation
in
the
file
assuming
your
other
argument
is
valid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
parole
board,
at
the
time
of
its
hearing,
takes
a
look
at
the
man’s
entire
file
and
finds
a
notation
to
years
ago
made
by
the
warden,
this
guy
has
set
fire
to
his
bunk,
december
2,
1973.
he
never
had
a
hearing
on
it.
it
was
simply
warden’s
upset.
maybe
the
warden
did
not
even
observe
it.
now,
is
the
parole
board
prevented
from
considering
that
because
he
did
not
have
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
does
your
argument
here
about
the
file
notation
have
any
added
weight
to
your
liberty
claim.
