justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
donahue
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
assume
that
within
a
given
institution
there
is
an
inmate
in
the
general
population,
to
start
with,
there
are
no
regulations
applicable
just
the
day
to
day
administration
by
the
warden,
and
he
is
transferred
from
the
general
population
to
solitary
confinement
for
six
month
period.
does
he
have
a
liberty
interest
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
assuming
no
regulations,
it
is
the
change
in
status
from
the
general
population
in
a
medium
security
institution
to
solitary
confinement
for
six
months
living
on
bread
and
water
during
this
entire
six
months.
but
it
is
not
cruel
and
unusual
i
do
not
to
posit
the
case
where
you
have
and
eighth
amendment
issue.
would
you
say
he
had
any
liberty
interested
of
which
he
had
been
deprived?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree
that
constitutionally
that
is
the
same
case
as
a
transfer
from
a
medium
security
institution
to
a
separate
facility
which
has
that
kind
of
conditions
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
transfer
to
solitary
confinement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
point
is
that
you
lost
part
of
it,
not
all
of
it,
is
that
not
it?
is
there
some
remaining
concept
of
liberty
with
the
inmate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
a
moment
mr.
jones.
supposing
a
man
is
out
on
parole
and
he
was
originally
sentenced
to
a
maximum
security
institution,
why
does
he
have
any
constitutionally
protected
right
to
a
hearing
before
his
parole
is
revoked?
why
is
he
different
from
a
man
who
originally
goes
into
maximum
then
gets
into
minimum?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones
just
a
follow
up
justice
rehnquist.
now
supposing
the
walpole
institution
repealed
all
the
existing
regulations
and
said,
nobody
goes
into
solitary
except
when
the
warden
decides
it
is
a
good
idea.
would
there
then
be
any
constitutional
right
to
have
a
hearing
before
you
leave
the
general
population
going
to
solitary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
in
your
thinking
the
answer
is
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
good
time
would
never
raise
the
question
because
that
is
all
was
lessening
the
sentence
the
judge
imposes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
logical
conclusion
in
your
position
would
be
that
the
institutions
would
be
better
off
to
minimize
the
number
of
rules
they
have,
to
leave
us
things
as
discretionary
and
flexible
as
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro
before
you
leave
that
point,
is
it
not
rather
fundamental
that
the
deprivation
that
triggers
the
operation
of
the
due
process
clause
must
be
of
a
sufficient
magnitude
to
be
called
a
“grievous
loss”
and
is
not
the
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
one
may
not
necessarily
conclude
that
that
particular
deprivation
is
sufficiently
serious
to
require
the
procedure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
still
not
be
a
sufficiently
grievous
loss
to
constitute
a
deprivation
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro,
mr.
donahue
told
us
that
both
sides
agreed,
as
i
recall
and
i
may
have
it
wrong,
that
if
the
summary
of
evidence
had
been
disclosed
to
the
inmates
that
they
would
have
been
a
threat
of
serious
harm
to
people
involved,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shapiro
may
i
ask
you
an
unrelated
question
while
you
are
interrupted.
in
some
of
the
briefs
as
referenced
to
the
large
number
of
transfers,
i
think
the
government
briefs
tell
us
there
are
14,000,
15,000
a
year
or
something
like
that
in
that
system.
i
do
not
recall
what
the
number
is
in
massachusetts
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
you
are
aware
of
that
tells
us
how
many
of
those
transfers
or
what
the
proportionate
transfers
are
from
a
higher
security
classification
to
a
lower
as
opposed
to
from
a
lower
to
higher.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
suppose
the
normal
change
would
be
from
higher
to
lower
classification
just
as
one
works
toward
parole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
