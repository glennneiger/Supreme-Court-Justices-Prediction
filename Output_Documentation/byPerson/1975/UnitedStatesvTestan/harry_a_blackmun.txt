do
you
know
by
any
chance
whether
there
had
been
many
requests
for
comparisons
since
the
testan
case
was
decided
by
the
court
of
claims?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
civil
service
commission
is
in
fact
paying
different
wages
for
the
same
work.
what
is
the
remedy
of
people
such
as
these
respondents?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
totally
prospective?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
the
second
route?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
there
just
is
no
review.
i
mean.
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
remedy?
justice
harry

mr.
rupp
before
you
sit
down,
i
ask
this
purely
out
of
curiosity
that
judge
consee
(ph)
did
not
sit
on
the
case
below,
did
he,
and
senior
judge
larmour
(ph)
did.
i
just
wondered
why
that
juxtaposition
through
such
a
word.
it
is
not
important,
but
i
just
wondered
if
you
happened
to
know?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
claims
and
it
concerns
the
basic
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
mr.
testan
and
mr.
zarrilli
are
government
trial
attorneys.
they
requested
their
employing
agency
to
reclassify
their
positions
to
a
higher
grade.
they
claim
that
their
duties
met
the
requirements
for
that
higher
grade
and
were
identical
to
the
duties
of
other
attorneys
in
another
agency.
thus
they
said
under
the
principle
of
equal
pay
for
a
substantially
equal
work
prescribed
in
the
classification
act,
they
were
entitled
to
the
higher
classification.
relief
was
denied
by
their
agency
and
by
the
civil
service
commission,
and
the
two
attorneys
then
sued
the
united
states
in
the
courts
of
claims.
they
sought
reclassification
and
back
pay.
that
court
held
that
it
was
not
empowered
to
direct
reclassification
but
it
further
held
that
if
the
civil
service
commission
were
to
decide
that
it
had
made
an
erroneous
classification,
then
the
court
could
award
money
damages
for
back
pay
lost.
it
also
held
that
court
had
power
to
order
the
commission
to
reconsider
the
classification
decision.
thus,
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
to
make
the
comparison
and
to
report
back.
we
reverse,
we
hold
that
the
tucker
act
which
is
the
statute
primarily
concurring
jurisdiction
upon
the
court
of
claims
whenever
a
substantive
right
enforceable
against
the
united
states
for
money
damages
exists,
does
not
in
itself
support
the
action
taken
by
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case.
we
also
hold
that
the
neither
the
classification
act
nor
the
back
pay
act
creates
a
substantive
rights
in
these
respondents
to
back
pay
for
the
period
of
the
claimed
wrongful
classification.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
