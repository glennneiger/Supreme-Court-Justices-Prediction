mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
are
that
the
respondents
are
correctly
classified
as
gs-13.
now,
the
issue
depends
upon
the
civil
service
commission’s,
general
attorney
series
and
upon
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
statute.
now
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well,
so
far
it
is
first
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
so
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
the
tucker
act
gives
the
court
jurisdiction
and
we
submit
that
it
absolutely
waives
sovereign
immunity
insofar
as
it
goes.
now,
that
provides
that
the
court
of
claims
who
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgment
upon
any
claim
against
the
united
states
founded
either
upon
the
constitution
or
any
act
of
congress
or
any
regulation
of
the
executive
department
or
upon
any
express
or
implying
contract
with
the
unites
states
or
for
liquidated
or
un-liquidated
damages
in
case
it
is
not
sounding
in
tort.
now,
we
submit
that
our
case
is
based
upon
one
that
classification
act
and
also
upon
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
at.
now,
the
court
of
claims
below
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
which
the
chief
judge
and
judges
davis
and
joshua
(ph)
and
--
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
four
to
three
and
nichols
joined,
ruled
this;
they
said
that
this
case
is
peculiar
in
its
facts.
whereas
here,
employees
all
belong
to
a
small
betterly
manageable
category.
their
jobs
have
a
large
nexus
of
duties
shared
in
common
and
other
employees
were
specifically
pointed
out
by
the
complaining
employees,
we
deem
the
case
to
be
different.
now,
the
case
on
which
the
court
of
claims
depended
was
the
selman
case,
selman
against
united
states.
in
that
case,
navy
captains
had
been
assigned
as
assistant
judge
advocate
generals
of
the
navy.
and
the
statute
provided
that
if
an
officer
was
assigned
to
that
position,
he
was
entitled
to
the
pay
of
rear
admiral-lower
half.
nevertheless
he
was
only
paid
at
the
rate
of
navy
captain’s
pay.
now,
when
it
came
to
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
of
claims
ruled
that
the
statute
was
mandatory
and
gave
them
the
pay
of
a
rear
admiral-lower
half
for
the
period
of
their
service
and
gave
selman
backpay
for
44
months.
now,
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
are
trial
attorneys
before
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals.
now,
the
trial
judge
pointed
out
and
he
set
forth
the
position,
descriptions
of
both
the
plaintiffs
which
are
under
gs-13
and
the
air
force
attorneys
which
are
gs-14
and
he
said
that
there
is
really
do
difference
between
the
position
descriptions.
the
duties
are
the
same.
they
prepare
cases,
try
cases,
file
posturing
briefs,
file
pre-trial
briefs,
interview
witnesses,
secure
expert
witnesses,
they
do
everything,
the
same
job
is
both
of
them.
now,
he
said
that
if
you
apply
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
statute
and
if
you
look
at
the
general
attorney
series,
you
come
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
be
classified
at
grade
gs-14.
mr.
edwin
j.
mcdermott
well,
selman
is
right
because
it
was
pursuant
to
a
statute
which
provided
for
that
pay,
a
pay
of
a
rear
admiral-lower
half
for
an
assistant
judge
advocate
general,
it
is
a
specific
provision
of
a
statute.
now,
we
say
that
whereas
selman
depended
upon
the
provisions
of
a
statute,
we
depend
upon
the
provisions
of
the
general
attorney
series
and
the
trial
judge
and
he
studied
this
case,
i
think
very
well,
he
said
this,
“that
the
action
of
the
comparison
of
the
position
descriptions
at
the
dpsc
and
the
aflc
demonstrate
that
they
are
strikingly
similar”
and
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
one
classifier,
for
instance,
how
that
dayton
would
look
at
the
general
attorney
series
of
the
position
description
and
come
to
the
conclusion
and
it
was
properly
classified
at
grade
gs-14.
whereas
the
position
classifier
at
the
defense
personnel
support
center
will
look
at
the
same
position
description,
the
same
general
attorney
series
and
come
to
the
conclusion,
that
it
was
properly
classified
at
gs-13.
now,
he
said
the
position
descriptions
are
almost
strikingly
similar
and
the
duties
of
the
trial
attorneys
are
the
same.
now,
also,
mr.
rupp
argued
that
the
back
pay
act
does
not
cover
the
situation.
now,
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
at
page
16
on
line
17,
there
is
an
analysis
of
the
back
pay
act.
now,
it
is
submitted
that
the
phrase
unjustified
or
unwarranted
personnel
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
back
pay
act
applies
as
well
to
this
action
wrongly
classifying
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
as
it
would
as
if
there
were
a
removal
or
reduction
in
rank
or
a
suspension.
and
he
--
that
is
pointed
out
that
the
congress
left
that
phrase
almost
open
for
interpretation
and
that
the
civil
service
commission
did
the
same
thing.
and
that
there
is
no
statement
in
any
of
the
congressional
hearings
or
reports
defining
what
is
meant
by
unjustified
or
unwarranted
personnel
action.
and
that
is
merely
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
we
submit
that,
on
that
basis
we
are
entitled
to
recover.
now,
so
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
we
depend
on
three
things.
one,
the
general
attorney
series
and
the
trial
judge
has
found
that
we
are
entitled
to
grade
gs-14
there
under.
there
are
only
two
factors
that
are
concerned
there
and
that
was
and
he
went
into
them
quite
thoroughly
in
his
opinion.
now,
actually
if
you
look
at
this
case
and
you
look
at
the
selman
case,
and
in
selman,
the
court
said,
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
rank
of
--
to
the
grade
--
payable
rear
admiral-lower
half
because
the
statute
so
provided.
we
say
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
grade
of
gs-14
because
the
general
attorney
series
so
provided
and
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
statute
so
provides.
now
actually,
if
you
come
down
to
the
position
of
the
civil
service
commission,
that
says
that
we
disregard
the
statute
which
says
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
we
look
at
the
position
description
of
the
person
only
under
the
series
which
is
applicable
to
it.
now,
the
court
of
claims
and
the
trial
judge
ruled
that
that
was
improper
and
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
the
commission
actually
refused
to
follow
a
congressional
mandate
of
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
and
there
are
many
cases,
recorded
claims
where
that
provision
has
been
established
and
enforced.
now,
we
submit
also
that
the
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
discrimination
in
this
case
and
he
specifically
found
that
out,
found
that
in
his
opinion
where
he
said
on
the
evidence
in
this
case
he
has
concluded
that
the
refusal
to
classify
plaintiffs
to
gs-14
is
arbitrary,
discriminatory
and
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
now,
if
there
be
discrimination
in
this
case,
then
we
cite
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
in
chambers
against
united
states,
and
that
ruled
that
a
black
applicant
for
a
position
in
the
social
security
administration
who
had
been
discriminated
against
was
entitled
to
backpay.
now,
that
is
a
very
well
written
opinion
by
judge
nichols
and
i
suggest
that
if
that
opinion
be
followed
and
fact
of
discrimination
be
found
to
have
been
adopted
by
the
trial
judge
as
a
finding,
based
upon
his
review
of
the
record
then
i
suggest
that
we
are
entitled
to
relief.
now
actually,
if
you
look
at
what
is
referred
to
as
the
remand
statute,
all
that
the
court
of
claims
has
done
here
has
been
to
follow
it.
they
found
that
the
civil
service
commission’s
action
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
that
the
commission
should
comply
with
the
mandate
of
the
statute
calling
for
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
and
the
court
of
claims
ruled
that
the
grades
of
other
lawyers
representing
in
other
per
curiam
agencies
before
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
provide
an
essential
benchmark
and
without
consideration
to
them
no
confidence
could
be
felt
to
the
statute
calling
for
equal
pay
for
equal
work
has
been
obeyed.
now
the
statute,
that
is
92-415,
that
is
what
is
referred
to
in
mr.
rupp’s
brief
as
the
remand
statute,
provides
that
in
any
case
within
its
jurisdiction
the
court
of
claims
shall
have
the
power
to
remand
appropriate
matters
to
any
administrative
or
executive
body
or
official
with
such
direction
as
it
may
deem
proper.
and
the
senate
report
pointed
out
that
the
act
provides
the
united
states
court
of
claims
with
the
necessary
means
to
compel
administrative
or
executive
bodies
to
take
further
action
where
it
is
necessary
to
make
an
adequate
record.
and
that
is
all
that
the
court
of
claims
has
done
here.
it
said
that
that
it
disagrees
with
the
trial
judge
that
the
court
has
the
right
to
reclassify
people,
but
that
is
a
job
for
the
civil
service
commission
and
it
remanded
it
back
to
the
civil
service
commission
to
take
into
consideration,
the
equal
pay
for
equal
work
statute
and
to
find
if
the
plaintiffs
using
as
a
benchmark
the
grade
applied
to
the
trial
attorneys
from
the
air
force
at
dayton
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
entitled
to
grade
gs-14
and
that
is
all
that
the
remand
statute
does.
so
we
ask
the
court
in
consideration
of
this
case
to
find
first
all
that
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction.
to
consider
this,
it
is
never
necessary
for
a
statute
to
itself
provide
that
for
a
breach
of
it,
a
person
shall
have
an
action
against
united
states
because
that
is
what
the
tucker
act
does.
the
tucker
act
gives
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
claims.
and
there
are
many
statutes
and
regulations,
the
breach
of
which
do
not
spell
out
the
right
to
sue
in
the
court
of
claims
for
damages.
so
we
submit
that
there
is
--
first
all
there
is
jurisdiction
and
that
it
is
a
good
thing
for
the
practice
of
law
generally
to
raise
the
grades
of
lawyers
who
appear
before
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals.
now,
we
have
a
letter
from
the
chairman
of
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
in
which
he
says
that
generally
most
of
the
lawyers
who
appear
before
them
are
grade
gs-14.
the
only
exception
appears
to
be
the
trial
attorneys
for
the
defense
personnel
support
center
and
when
they
do
the
same
work
that
other
lawyers
do
before
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
then
i
submit
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
pay
because
it
is
equal
work,
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
that
is
a
statutory
definition
and
reinstate
and
i
submit
that
the
court
of
claims’
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you,
sir.
