mr.
john
p.
rupp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
by
the
court
of
claims.
two
questions
were
presented
in
the
petition.
first,
whether
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction
over
this
case
and
second,
whether
in
determining
the
correctness
of
respondent's
classifications,
the
classification
act
requires
that
there
positions
be
compared
with
the
positions
held
by
employees
in
another
federal
agency.
the
relevant
facts
are
both
few
and
largely
undisputed.
respondents
were
employed
as
trail
attorneys
by
the
defense
supply
agency
of
the
defense
personnel
support
center
in
philadelphia.
there
positions
are
subject
to
the
classification
act
and
under
that
act,
they
were
at
all
relevant
times
classified
at
civil
service
grade
gs-13.
on
december
9,
1969,
they
submitted
requests
to
their
employing
agency
seeking
reclassification
to
civil
service
grade
gs-14.
in
support
of
those
requests,
they
argued
that
they
were
entitled
to
reclassification
at
gs-14
under
standards,
the
general
standard
promulgated
by
the
civil
service
commission.
and
secondly,
that
their
positions
were
identical
to
positions
occupied
by
attorneys
employed
by
the
air
force
logistics
command
in
dayton,
ohio,
positions
that
were
classified
one
grade
higher
than
their
own.
after
an
audit
by
a
position
classification
specialist,
respondents'
employing
agency
informed
them
that
they
were
properly
classified
at
gs-13.
on
appeal,
the
civil
service
commission
endorsed
that
conclusion,
made
the
same
finding
and
denied
respondents
request
for
a
classification.
the
commission
also
ruled
and
informed
respondents
that
the
comparisons
that
they
had
requested
did
not
constitute
a
proper
method
of
classification
under
the
classification
act.
respondents
then
filed
the
present
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
seeking
an
order
directing
their
reclassification
to
gs-14
as
of
the
date
of
the
first
administrative
denial
of
their
requests
and
backpay
accrued
from
that
date.
the
court
of
claims
in
a
four
to
three
decision
ruled
that
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
case
under
the
tucker
act
and
on
the
merits
that
the
civil
service
commission
had
been
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
not
making
the
comparisons
that
respondents
had
requested,
the
court
therefore,
remanded
the
case
to
the
civil
service
commission
with
instructions
to
undertake
the
requested
comparisons
and
to
report
the
results
to
the
court.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
know
of
one.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
there
--
i
know
of
one
that
resulted
in
a
decision.
there
is
case
decided
by
the
district
of
--
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
chapter
in
which
the
court
held
the
comparisons
were
not
required,
were
not
appropriate.
i
did
not
know
and
i
may
have
misconceived
your
question
initially.
i
did
not
know
whether
many
such
requests
have
been
made
directly
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
then
had
not
been
pursued
after
they
have
been
denied.
i
do
know
that
the
civil
service
commission’s
policy
is
uniformly
to
deny
such
requests.
as
noted
in
our
reply
brief
the
central
and
in
our
judgment
dispositive
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
any
federal
statute
or
statutes
gives
respondents
a
substantive
right
to
recover
from
the
united
states
money
damages
for
the
period
of
a
wrongful
civil
service
classification.
in
assuming
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
the
court
of
claims
conceded
that
the
classification
process
involves
substantial
discretion,
a
concession
which
i
think
flows
naturally
from
this
case
decision
in
the
ramsbeck
case.
the
court
of
claims
also
conceded
that
it
was
without
power
to
direct
respondents
for
classification.
the
court
reasoned,
however,
that
if
respondents
found
administratively
to
be
entitled
to
reclassification,
that
determination
could
create
a
right
to
money
damages
or
right
to
reclassification
which
the
court
could
then
force
by
way
of
a
money
judgment.
well,
i
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
claims
dealt
at
best
equivocally
with
the
issue
of
its
jurisdiction.
the
court
appeared
to
assume
first
that
a
substantive
right
to
the
recovery
of
money
damages
against
the
united
states
could
appropriately
be
found
by
implication.
and
second,
that
the
history
of
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
its
employees,
evidence
is
an
intent
on
congress’
part
to
permit
the
recovery
of
money
damages
for
the
period
of
wrongful
civil
service
classification.
we
submit
that
both
of
these
assumptions
which
are
together
essential
to
what
holding
at
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
so
that
the
cause
of
action
was
stated
are
incorrect.
it
is
settled
of
course
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
under
the
tucker
act
is
limited
to
cases
in
which
the
claimants
seek
actual
presently
due
money
damages,
claims
founded
upon
the
constitution,
any
federal
statute,
etcetera.
to
that
extent
then
we
acknowledge
that
congress
has
waived
in
the
tucker
act
a
portion
of
the
sovereign
immunity
or
the
historic
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
suit.
but
its
essential
i
think
to
recognize
that
the
tucker
act
is
not
itself
create
any
substantive
rights
to
the
recovery
of
money
damages
from
the
united
states.
whether
the
claimants
such
as
respondents
are
entitled
to
the
recovery
of
money
damages
depends
in
our
view,
upon
the
existences
of
the
statute
or
combination
of
statutes,
a
substantive
provision
of
some
sort
in
a
statute
expressly
and
unequivocally
waiving
the
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
the
recovery
of
money
damages
from
the
public
treasury.
it
is
not
sufficient
for
these
purposes
in
our
view
nor
indeed
is
it
even
relevant
that
the
existence
of
such
a
substantive
right
might
be
thought
responsive
to
a
particular
conception
of
public
policy.
the
settled
rule
followed
in
countless
cases,
many
of
which
are
cited
in
our
main
brief
at
pages
six
through
eight,
prohibits
courts
from
implying
authority
to
collect
upon
the
public
treasury
which
is
precisely
what
the
court
of
claims
did
here
and
what
respondents
would
have
them
do.
respondents'
contention
to
the
contrary
apparently
precedes
from
their
view
as
the
tucker
act,
of
the
tucker
act
as
constituting
not
only
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
claims
over
particular
types
of
cases,
that
is
those
involving
claims
from
money
damages,
but
also
is
creating
substantive
rights
to
money
damages
whenever
the
provisions
of
any
federal
statute
have
been
violated.
we
submit
that
those
are
separate
issues
and
that
they
must
be
analyzed
separately.
an
example,
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
there
waived
a
portion
of
the
historic
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
suit.
it
incorporated
the
law
of
the
place
and
gave
to
private
parties
a
substantive
right
to
proceed
against
the
united
states
for
certain
types
of
tortuous
activities.
it
did
not,
however,
waive
the
immunity
of
the
united
states
to
suits
in
the
court
to
such
suits
in
the
court
of
claims.
respondents'
failure
to
appreciate
the
distinction
between
substantive
rights
and
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
leads
them
to
the
a
conclusion
that
would
render
meaningless,
the
multitude
of
federal
statutes
in
which
congress
has
expressly
created
a
right
to
money
damages
in
particular
and
clearly
defines
circumstances
in
favor
of
private
parties.
respondents'
view
would
render
the
back
pay
act,
certainly
superfluous
as
would
it
render
a
meaningless
--
a
number
of
other
statutory
provisions,
for
example,
the
provision
in
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972,
42
u.s.c.
2000
(e)
(5)
(g)
which
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
the
wickersham
case,
it
is
important
to
recognize
i
think
that
the
context
in
which
the
wickersham
case
was
decided.
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
civil
service
act
1883,
this
court
held
in
several
cases
that
federal
employees
who
were
discharged
or
not
promoted
stated
no
cause
of
action,
were
not
entitled
to
judicial
redress,
notwithstanding
the
cause
or
reasons,
the
grounds
for
their
suspension.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
keim
and
hennan
are
the
principal
cases,
i
suppose.
with
the
passage
of
the
civil
service
act
of
1883,
which
was
measurably
strengthened
by
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
in
1912,
this
court,
beginning
with
the
united
states
versus
wickersham,
and
other
courts
recognized
that
federal
--
and
that
congress
intended
that
federal
employees
should
not
be
separated
from
their
position
wrongfully,
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
privileges
and
emoluments
of
the
position
to
which
they
were
appointed
until
they
were
wrongfully
separated.
that
is
what
those
statutes
meant,
separation
for
cause
and
not
otherwise.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
courts
have
continued
to
recognize
that
people
are
not
entitled
to
receive
the
salary
of
the
position
to
which
they
have
never
been
appointed.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
to
some
extent
it
was.
it
certainly
covered
a
--
some
kinds
of
cases
and
maybe
the
kinds
of
cases
that
will
arise
in
the
majority
kind
of
cases.
although
the
back
pay
act
extended
protections
to
classes
of
employees
who
had
not
been
there
to
--
for
protected
by
judicial
decision.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
particularly
of
the
back
pay
act
amendments
passed
in
1966,
congress
thought
it
was
filling
in
the
gaps
left
by
the
back
pay
act
of
1948,
which
the
legislative
history
indicated
was
tied
to
section
7101
of
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
and
judicial
decision.
at
the
time
they
passed
those
amendments
in
1966,
they
gave
a
rather
careful
consideration
to
the
costs
of
the
coverage
that
they
were
providing
for.
now,
if
the
violation
of
any
federal
statute,
including
the
classification
act
gave
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
for
backpay,
it
would
have
been
a
hold
if
you
liked
to
pass
the
back
pay
act
or
any
number
of
other
federal
statutes
such
as
the
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
there
are
two,
i
suppose
and
they
are
or
perhaps
more
properly
stated
they
are
part
of
the
same
process.
the
first
thing
they
may
do
is
file
a
request
for
reclassification
with
their
employing
agency.
a
position
classifications
specialist
is
then
obligated
to
look
at
their
positions
to
perform
an
audit
of
their
positions
and
attempt
to
determine
whether
their
positions
have
been
properly
classified.
at
that
--
if
the
decision
by
the
employing
agency
which
draws
upon
the
audit
is
not
satisfactory
to
the
employees,
they
have
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes
and
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
we
are
not
here
saying
simply
that
these
employees
are
entitled
to
backpay.
we
are
saying
as
well
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
retroactive
reclassification.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well
again
it
is
part
of
the
same
route.
once
the
employees
have
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies,
i
suppose
that
there
might
be
cases
in
which
they
could
file
suit
in
the
district
court
seeking
perspective
equitable
relief.
although
i
do
not
see
any
basis,
any
jurisdictional
basis
for
such
a
suit
other
than
the
mandamus
act
28,
1361
and
i
concede
as
well
that
the
scope
of
review
on
mandamus
is
restrictive.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
it
does
not.
the
claim
that
the
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
if
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
civil
service
commission
says
for
the
future
we
will
not
promote
anyone
with
blue
eyes
or
anyone
who
is
black,
i
have
little
doubt
that
the
district
court
would
entertain
a
suit
under
the
mandamus
action
and
would
overturn
that
determination.
if
however
it
is
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
and
1331,
yes,
that
is
right.
in
a
case
in
which
there
were
a
decision
within
the
discretion
of
the
employing
agency
in
the
civil
service
commission
going
to
the
duties
and
responsibilities
performed
and
whether
under
the
relevant
standards
those
duties
and
responsibilities
merited
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
thank
you.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
point
of
my
argument
this
morning
was
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
imply
authority
to
collect
from
the
public
treasury
of
the
united
states.
to
complete
that
discussion
let
me
only
make
a
couple
of
additional
points.
the
first
is
that
the
principles
that
are
discussed
this
morning
do
not
govern
fifth
amendment
taking
cases
in
the
citation
by
respondents
and
amici
in
this
case
to
those
cases
appears
to
us
consequently
to
have
been
misplaced.
the
fifth
amendment
by
its
very
terms
is
as
this
court
recognize
in
the
rail
reorganization
act
cases,
a
self
executing
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
would
mean
nothing
if
it
did
not
meant
that.
this
court
has
recognized
that,
beginning
with
the
cosby
case,
and
that
view
was
reaffirmed
in
the
rail
reorganization
act
cases.
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
implicated
in
this
case
and
those
cases
do
not
govern
here.
the
second
and
the
last
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
that
regard
is
that
neither
is
this
a
case
like
bivens
or
bell
versus
hood
where
the
immunity
of
the
united
states
is
not
directly
implicated.
the
issue
in
those
cases,
fundamentally,
in
those
cases
is
fundamentally
is
whether
the
activities
complained
of
the
basis
for
the
suit
in
those
cases
were
acts
of
the
sovereign
with
respect
to
which
the
defendants
there
were
entitled
to
claim
sovereign
immunity.
although
that
issue
may
not
be
finally
be
disposed
of,
it
seems
relatively
clear
that
if
the
person
or
a
federal
employee
is
acting
unconstitutionally
or
beyond
the
scope
of
his
or
her
statutory
authority,
those
allegations
are
not
made
here.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes.
this
court
has
so
held.
the
importance
of
the
court
of
claims,
to
the
court
of
claims
assumption
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
of
its
being
able
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states
stems
precisely
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
federal
statute
expressly
and
unequivocally
waiving
or
implying
a
substantive
right
in
favor
of
individual
federal
employees
to
collect
from
the
public
treasury
for
the
period
of
an
assuredly
wrongful
civil
service
classification.
indeed
the
respondents
in
the
amici
had
appeared
to
concede
that
there
is
no
such
substantive
provision
is
explicitly
so
providing
in
the
classification
act,
and
in
fact
when
the
scheme
provided
for
in
the
classification
act,
the
classification
process
provided
for
in
that
act
is
viewed
as
a
whole,
it
seems
to
me
apparent
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
classifications
would
operate
either
retroactively
or
that
reclassification
might
provide
a
predicate
for
the
recovery
of
backpay.
for
example,
the
classification
acts
provides
in
a
number
of
provisions
that
the
classification
certificates
issued
by
employing
agencies
in
the
first
instance
and
on
occasion
in
the
event
of
review
by
the
civil
service
commission
are
to
be
binding
on
payroll,
certifying
and
other
officials
with
authority
to
disperse
monies
from
the
public
treasury.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
classification
act,
warning
either
at
retroactive
reclassification
or
the
award
of
backpay.
neither,
i
should
note,
is
there
any
suggestion,
however,
tenuous
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
classification
act
supporting
the
claim
made
by
respondents
in
this
case.
that
omission
it
seems
to
me
is
particularly
significant
in
light
of
the
long
standing
rule
that
federal
employees
are
entitled
to
receive
only
the
salaries
of
the
positions
to
which
they
were
appointed,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
may
have
performed
duties
of
another
higher
paying
position.
furthermore,
although
the
classification
act
has
been
in
effect
for
approximately
50
years,
although
significantly
amended
in
1948,
but
in
its
essential
and
effect
for
over
50
years,
we
have
been
able
to
locate
only
one
of
the
case
in
which
the
court
of
claims
or
any
other
court,
we
know
of
no
other
court,
that
so
held
by
implication
as
the
court
of
claims
did
here.
the
only
other
case
in
which
the
court
of
claims
appeared
to
assume
in
dicta
and
again
without
reaching
the
issue
that
the
classification
act
might
provide
a
warrant
for
a
retroactive
reclassification
or
the
award
of
backpays,
the
case
bookman
(ph)
versus
the
united
states.
prior
to
the
decision
in
bookman,
the
court
of
claims
had
consistently
and
repeatedly
held
that
federal
employees
were
only
entitled
to
the
salaries
of
the
positions
to
which
they
were
appointed.
they
so
held
in
cases
such
as
bear
versus
the
united
states,
price
versus
the
united
state
and
coleman
versus
united
states
and
as
recently
as
1968,
none
of
those
cases
were
cited
or
discussed
in
the
court’s
opinion
in
this
case.
in
the
series
of
decisions
extending
over
40
years,
beginning
shortly
after
passage
of
the
classification
act,
the
comptroller
general
of
the
united
states
has
taken
the
same
position,
that
is
that
reclassifications
may
operate
perspectively
only
and
that
federal
employees
may
not
recover
back
pay
for
the
period
of
a
wrongful
classification.
the
only
exception
to
this
general
rule
that
has
been
recognized
has
been
for
administrative
errors,
attributable
to
the
failure
of
the
subordinate
to
implement
a
valid
classification
decision
made
by
the
employing
agency
or
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
that
may
be
true.
although
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case
expressly
disclaimed
the
erroneous
on
the
back
pay
act,
let
me
make
a
couple
points
in
that
regard.
again
the
back
pay
act
is
not
explicitly
provided
for
the
payment
of
money
damages
for
the
period
of
a
wrongful
classification.
the
back
pay
act
authorizes
the
award
of
backpay
and
“to
an
employee
subjected
to
an
unjustified
or
unwarranted
personnel
action
that
has
resulted
in
the
withdrawal
or
reduction”
of
all
or
part
of
his
compensation.
that
language
does
not
cover
the
situation
with
which
we
have
been
presented
here
which
does
not
involve
the
withdrawal
or
the
reduction
of
compensation,
but
in
assuredly
wrongful
failure
to
increase
compensation.
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
that
language,
and
i
think
there
is
none,
the
legislative
history
of
the
back
pay
act
makes
unmistakably
clear
that
congress
meant
that
act
to
apply
only
to
wrongful
suspensions,
demotions,
removals
and
other
unwarranted
and
unjustified
personnel
actions
resulting
from
the
reassignments
or
a
transfer
from
full
or
part-time
work.
the
back
pay
act
originally
grew
out
of
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
of
1912
which
governed
dismissals
and
suspensions.
as
amended
in
1966,
the
congress
filled
in
a
number
of
gaps
in
the
act,
but
did
not
provide
for
the
recovery
of
backpay
for
persons
wrongfully
classified.
the
court
of
claims
prior
to
this
case
has
held
as
well
that
the
back
pay
act
does
not
provide
a
predicate
for
the
recovery
by
federal
employees
of
backpay
for
the
period
of
wrongful
classifications.
for
it
would
have
ruled
otherwise
other
than
it
did
in
this
case
then
it
would
have
required
to
overrule
a
long
line
of
its
own
decision,
including
desmond
versus
united
states,
dianish
versus
united
states
and
gaines
versus
the
united
states.
even
if
a
substantive
right
to
the
recovery
of
money
damages
against
the
united
states
for
the
period
of
a
wrongful
classification
could
appropriately
be
found
by
implication
and
as
i’ve
argued
this
morning
and
in
our
briefs
that
it
cannot
be.
i
think
that,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
claims
would
no
less
assuredly
have
been
without
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
we
have
discussed
in
some
detail
the
history
of
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
its
employees.
in
our
briefs,
we
discussed
it
a
bit
further
this
morning.
the
fact
is
that
when
congress
was
considering
the
classification
act
and
the
back
pay
act,
the
prevailing
rule
was
that
wrongfully
classified
civil
service
employees
were
not
entitled
to
the
recovery
of
backpay.
congress
could
have
provided
in
either
the
classification
act
or
the
back
pay
act,
for
such
recovery,
it
did
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
persuasive
evidence
of
congress'
intent
not
permit
the
recovery
of
backpay
such
as
that
sought
by
respondents
in
this
case
in
the
circumstances
presented
in
their
compliant.
one
final
point
on
the
jurisdictional
or
cause
of
action
aspect
of
this
case,
that
is
the
argument
made
by
the
amici
that
our
position
in
this
case
would
leave
respondents
wholly
without
remedy
for
wrongful
classifications.
as
their
discussion
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
classification
act
reveals,
i
think,
congress
created
in
the
classification
act
an
elaborate
set
of
administrative
safeguards
to
ensure
that
the
goals
of
the
act
would
be
met
in
practice,
including
the
goal
of
equal
pay
for
substantially
equal
work.
we
have
also
acknowledged
that
a
suit
could
be
brought
in
district
courts
seeking
perspective
classification,
although
that
remedy,
the
scope
of
that
remedy
is
of
course
a
limited
one.
to
the
extent
that
persons
wrongfully
classified
or
assuredly
wrongfully
classified
are
without
backpay
for
the
period
of
that
wrongful
classification
is
a
matter
in
our
view
to
be
left
to
congress.
they
have
resolved
this
far
not
to
provide
backpay
under
the
circumstances.
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
contention
that
the
civil
commission
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
refusing
to
compare
respondents’
positions
with
the
positions
held
by
employees
in
another
federal
agency,
let
me
say
only
that
that
kind
of
position
to
position
comparison
was
very
substantially
the
kind
of
classification
scheme
which
congress
rejected
in
1923
when
it
enacted
the
classification
act.
they
are
inseparable
in
our
view,
practical
difficulties
associated
with
the
suggestion
that
the
civil
service
commission
has
a
duty
to
compare
positions
under
any
circumstances.
the
court
of
claims
attempted
to
deal
with
these
difficulties
in
part
by
suggesting
that
its
holding
was
limited
to
circumstances
which
the
complaining
employees
and
employees
referred
to,
had
a
large
nexus
of
duties
performed
in
common.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
if
you
hold
that
the
court
of
claims
had
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
you
would
have
to
reach
point
two.
we
believe
the
case
is
over
as
soon
as
you
have
looked
at
jurisdiction.
the
entire
thrust
of
the
classification
act
is
to
require
the
classification
of
positions
by
reference
to
generally
applicable
standards
repeatedly
in
the
classification
act.
the
civil
service
commission
is
required
to
promulgate
generally
applicable
standards.
employing
agencies
are
obligated
to
look
at
those
classification
standards
in
making
classifications,
in
reviewing
the
appropriateness
of
classifications.
the
civil
service
commission
is
required
again
to
scrutinize
the
classification
decisions
reached
by
employing
agencies
in
light
of
the
general
classification
standards.
one
of
the
great
problems
that
would
be
presented
with
the
civil
service
commission
to
have
a
duty
to
perform
comparisons
of
the
type
requested
by
respondents
is
that
the
employing
agency
in
the
first
instance
would
not
have
access
to
the
kind
of
information
it
would
need
to
make
such
comparisons.
you
would
then
have
the
decision
made
by
--
a
classification
decision
made
by
an
employing
agency
not
taking
into
account
the
full
range
of
considerations
made
appropriate
by
the
court
of
claims'
decision
in
this
case.
not
only
then
would
federal
civil
service
employees
have
the
prospect
of
to
bite
it
said
very
largely
the
same
apple,
they
would
also
have
the
prospect
of
review
by
a
body
obligated
to
take
into
account
considerations
that
could
not
have
been
taken
into
account
by
the
employing
agency.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
very
great
likelihood
that
that
would
stimulate
appeals
in
a
large
number
of
cases
in
which
appeals
were
not
warranted.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
yes,
that
is
right
and
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
that
is
a
problem.
there
is
a
further
problem
then
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
there
is
the
problem
that
you
suggest
and
we
referred
to
that
in
our
brief
and
another
related
problem
is
that
the
civil
service
commission
could
not
necessarily
assume
that
the
position
appointed
to
by
the
complaining
employees
was
properly
classified.
i
suppose
it
would
have
prima
facie,
be
entitled
to
prima
facie
considerations
of
proper
classification,
but
to
do
the
kind
of
job
that
the
court
of
claims
appeared
to
require
in
this
case
would
require
the
civil
service
commission
not
only
to
make
the
comparison
that
it
had
been
requested,
but
to
validate
the
classification
of
the
positions
being
pointed
out.
at
least
in
theory
that
is
going
to
double
the
work
of
the
civil
service
commission.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
they
do
both.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
in
theory,
of
course
they
should
do
one
or
the
other.
decisions
from
the
court
of
claims
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
their
support
for
either
preposition;
i
think
the
proper
courts
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
although
there
is
support
for
the
contrary,
particularly
given
the
implications
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
it
may
not
be.
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
opinion
in
gnotta
would
lead
to
that
conclusion.
i
think
the
contrary
of
argument
could
be
made
with
some
reasonableness.
it
is
without
significance
here.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct
and
they
would
be
obligated
to
do
precisely
the
same
having
reached
that
conclusion.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
do
not
know.
i
am
sorry.
