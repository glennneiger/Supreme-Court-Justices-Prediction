of
course
if
you
read,
if
you
read
the
wickersham
case,
mr.
rupp,
you
wonder
if
the
back
pay
act
was
not
superfluous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
keim
and
those
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
really,
all
the
back
pay
act
does
is
say
if
you
are
wrongfully
denied
your
emoluments,
youâ€™re
entitled
to
backpay,
i
would
have
thought
--
i
thought
that
was
established
by
wickersham?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
it
does
not
cover
discretionary
decisions
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
you
would
have
1331
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
must
the
united
states
be
the
only
defendant
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
often
that
the
justice
department
relies
on
the
comptroller
general
to
support
its
views,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
did
not
mean
to
interrupt.
if
a
plaintiff
files
a
complaint
in
the
court
of
claims
and
says
that
the
back
pay
act
and
the
classification
act
together,
give
me
a
claim
for
money
damages
against
the
united
states
and
goes
on
to
detail
particulars.
the
court
of
claims
decides
that
neither
of
those
acts
does
give
a
claim
for
money
damages
against
united
states.
does
the
court
of
claims
dismiss
for
one
of
jurisdiction
or
for
failure
to
stay
the
claim
on
which
relief
could
be
granted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
they
had
to
do
one
or
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
mean
as
a
practice,
but
i
mean,
what
should
they
do,
largely
under
your
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
make
two
jumps
though
to
have
the
selman
case
control
this
case,
do
you
not?
you
have
got
that
there
is
language
in
either
the
back
pay
act
or
the
classification
act
that
is
equally
mandatory
and
you
have
got
to
show
that
selman
is
right
in
the
light
of
our
decision
in
the
king
case?
