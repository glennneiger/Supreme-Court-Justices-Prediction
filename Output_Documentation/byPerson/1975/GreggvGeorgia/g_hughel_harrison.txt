mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
hughel
harrison
from
lawrenceville,
georgia
and
i
represent
troy
leon
gregg
who
is
now
under
two
death
sentences
for
murder.
originally
he
was
tried
on
two
murder
charges
plus
two
armed
robbery
cases.
the
georgia
supreme
court
on
its
review
of
the
case,
set
aside
the
death
penalties
as
to
armed
robbery
and
that
the
--
for
two
grounds.
that
the
armed
robbery
had
been
used
as
a
aggravating
circumstance
on
the
murder
cases
and
that
the
death
penalty
was
disproportionate
for
the
punishment
of
this
crime.
gregg
was
tried
under
a
1973
law
in
georgia
that
made
some
changes
in
our
death
penalty.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
only
one
offense
and
that
of
perjury
was
deleted.
the
general
assembly
provided
for
a
bifurcated
trial
under
which
at
the
first
phase,
you
would
determine
guilt
or
innocence
and
that
only.
then
that
same
jury
was
to
consider
the
punishment
that
would
be
imposed
and
we
submit
that
in
this
area,
we
still
have
some
of
the
arbitrariness
and
the
discretion
and
that
we
do
not
meet
the
furman
standard.
in
the
1973
law,
there
were
ten
enumerated
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
those
are
set
out
and
i
believe
they
are
set
out
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent
in
that
the
appendix
was
not
printed
on
the
appellant's
--
petitioner's
brief.
those
are
specified
and
referred
to
as
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
at
this
phase
of
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
must
determine
which
of
those
he
will
submit
and
in
addition
the
jury,
as
i
understand
the
law,
can
consider
other
aggravating
circumstances
to
use
the
language
as
authorized
by
law.
nowhere
does
the
statute
make
any
definition
of
a
mitigating
circumstance.
it
is
completely
silent.
now,
in
this
case
when
we
proceed,
with
the
senates
in
phase
and
after
instructions
and
these
instructions
are
required
to
be
carried
out
with
the
jury
and
the
jury
make
its
finding
and
indicate
what
the
aggravating
circumstances
are.
this
record
reveals
that,
if
i
recall
correctly,
some
three
were
submitted.
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
and
made
its
recommendation
of
death
which
was
binding
upon
the
court
when
that
recommendation
is
made,
so
the
substantive
change
in
our
law.
before
that
the
jury
made
its
finding.
if
it
made
a
recommendation
of
mercy
then
only
life
sentence
could
be
imposed,
and
if
it
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty
in
these
cases
then
it
was
the
automatic
death
sentence.
now,
then
73
law
provide
for
an
appeal.
this
is
in
addition
to
our
review,
a
statutory
review.
this
was
in
addition
to
the
usual
and
normal
appeal
which
was
done
in
this
case
and
it
is
submitted
that,
while
this
is
desirable,
it
does
not
cure
some
of
the
discrepancies
and
arbitrariness
of
furman.
in
this,
the
trial
court
is
required
to
submit
to
the
appellate
court,
his
evaluation,
shown
on
appendix
b
of
the
brief
for
the
respondent.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
this
because
it
illustrates
the
effect
of
action
in
the
trial
court
level
on
the
appellate
court.
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
was,
in
this
report
says
--
number
seven
on
page
3b
on
the
end,
was
an
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances.
the
trial
court
says
no.
this
removes
from
consideration,
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
in
this
case
and
where
there
was
a
written
statement,
exculpatory
in
nature
taken
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
this
removed
and
i
submit
removed
it
in
the
appellate
level.
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
this
case
and
i
think,
i
would
apologize
for
going
into
the
evidence
to
this
point,
but
upon
arrest
in
north
carolina,
gregg
made
a
statement
to
the
georgia
authorities
when
they
questioned
him
about
what
had
happened.
it
was
exculpatory
in
nature
and
that
he
said
there
was
a
fight
and
he
did
it
in
self
defense.
there
was
evidence
in
the
record,
including
the
lip
of
one
sam
allan
and
some
evidence
as
to
some
abrasions
on
the
hands
of
one
of
the
victims,
but
gregg
was
carried
from
asheville
down
inter
state
85,
past
the
most
direct
route
to
lawrenceville.
sometime
before
daybreak
early
in
the
morning
in
the
presence
of
and
after
having
been
transported
from
asheville
to
this
area,
with
the
district
attorney,
the
prosecuting
officer
in
the
back
seat
with
and
gregg
under
handcuffs,
the
other
passenger
in
that
car
being
the
chief
of
the
county
police
of
rennet
county
and
one
of
the
detectives
that,
that
in
two
hours
turned
around
and
proceeded
back
north
to
the
scene
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
that
detective
barnett
said
that
there
was
a
restatement
or
reenactment
of
what
happened.
they
also
testified
that
the
chief
of
police
told
gregg
that
this
is
the
way
it
happened,
(inaudible).
gregg
is
supposed
to
have
said
yes,
but
this
record
reveals
that
gregg
refused
to
sign
a
statement.
gregg
denied
it
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
but
this
removes
entirely
we
submit,
any
consideration
of
the
mitigation
--
mitigating
circumstances.
now,
where
does
that
leave
us?
i
objected
strenuously,
tied
to
keep
this
evidence
out,
notwithstanding
this,
on
the
trial
of
this
case
when
it
was
charged,
the
effect
of
the
charge
in
this
case
is
to
submit
to
this
jury
the
question
you
either
acquit
him
or
you
convict
him.
the
lesser
included
defenses
of
manslaughter
or
even
the
statutory
right
of
a
jury
to
find
and
attempt,
even
if
a
crime
was
committed,
affectively
deprived
the
jury
of
any
discretion,
except
you
either
find
it
as
a
murder
or
justifiable
homicide,
that
is
what
the
charge
is
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no
sir,
certainly
i
think
there
is
a
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
also
as
a
matter
of
right,
i
think
a
jury,
at
least
in
georgia,
has
a
right
to
convict
of
a
lesser
included
offense,
particularly
in
a
capital
case.
that
is
true
in
most
other
felonies,
but
in
the
capital
cases
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
not
on
necessity
your
honor,
i
think
it
comes
back
down
to
show
that
whether
we
use
equal
protection
in
this
sense
of
what
happened
to
allen.
there
were
two
people
who
were
involved
in
an
incidence.
two
people,
one
suffering
the
death
sentence
and
one
going
away
with
ten
years,
for
no
reason,
no
explainable
reason.
gregg,
no
prior
record,
he
admitted
he
killed
the
people,
but
he
said
he
did
it
in
self
defense.
jury
rejected
it
and
that
apparently
is
in
now
it
is
still
suffering
the
death
penalty
and
he
is
under
today,
two
of
them.
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
1973
law
was
an
attempt
to
meet
firmly
and
it
has
not
done
it.
it
still
leads
that
discretion
both
in
the
prosecution.
i
submit
to
you,
whether
it
is
right
or
wrong
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
some
discretion
must
be
vested
in
the
prosecuting
attorney,
we
must
have
it,
but
is
that
to
be
unlimited
and
is
it
to
have
the
right
to
care
with
it,
you
live,
you
die.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
i
would
follow
that
argument
mr.
chief
justice
and
particularly
to
this
point,
that
in
the
end
result,
whatever
it
might
--
what
process
we
might
have
to
get
to
that,
that
here
under
this
statute,
the
arbitrariness
no
guidelines.
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
of
georgia.
a
man
can
be
indicted
for
murder
and
before
that
case
is
called
for
trial,
the
district
attorney
can
stand
up
with
no
reason
and
(inaudible),
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
the
only
limitation
is
it
once
it
is
submitted
to
a
jury
then
he
must
have
the
approval
to
do
it.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
except
your
honor
when
it
becomes
really
effective
in
the
breast
of
the
court
for
trial.
before
that
case
is
called
for
trial,
the
district
attorney
can
just
(inaudible).
he
can
determine
when
he
calls
it
and
if
he
were
called.
now
this
is
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
sir,
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
understood
you.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
of
course,
there
is
that
remedy
to
the
ballot
box,
but
had
to
precede
the
re-indict
and
i
am
sure
the
argument
might
be
made,
well,
he
does
not
indict,
but
for
all
practical
purposes
he
does,
because
he
attends
upon
the
grand
jury,
he
prepares
the
indictments
and
submits
them.
there
is
only
your
honor,
only
the
individual
discretion
i
submit
to
you.
it
is
the
only
limitation
on
whether
or
not
a
district
attorney
of
what
he
does.
just
as
in
this
case
and
they
could
be
no
better
illustration
of
it
than
in
this
case.
sam
allan
who
was
with
him
and
under
any
theory
of
georgia
law,
he
is
just
as
guilty
as
troy
leon
gregg.
we
have
no
excuse
to
use
him
as
a
state
witness,
no
trade
of
--
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no
sir,
his
only
appearance
in
this
case
was
to
be
brought,
adjunct
to
the
courtroom
for
the
purpose
of
identification,
that
was
all.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
no
sir,
i
believe
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
an
officer
identifying
sam
allan
if
i
recall
it
correctly
on
it.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
he
did
not.
he
was
just
brought
to
the
edge
of
the
courtroom
for
so
he
could
be
seen.
so
it
was
not
necessary
in
the
usual
thing
of
turning
state
evidence
is
not
apparent
here.
so
this
to
me
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
it.
two
people,
equally
guilty
on
any
theory
of
law,
one
with
ten,
20
years
and
the
other
with
the
death
penalty
with
no
prior
record.
now,
your
honors
the
1973
act
has
not
intended
at
all
and
made
no
change
in
what
happened
beyond
the
appellate
level,
in
the
executive
clemency.
it
is
in
the
area
of
being
in
the
court
with
the
prosecutor,
with
the
jury
and
the
trial
judge,
even
in
his
instruction
and
i
do
not
think
we
can
avoid
that
in
this
instance
and
the
uncertainty
of
what
the
jury
is
given
to
find
insofar
as
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
justice
powell,
you
were
asking
about
some
of
the
broadness
of
the
language
that
was
contained
in
the
north
carolina
statute.
the
code
section
enumerating
this
ten,
flip
on
8a
of
appendix
a,
you
see
we
start
enumerating
these
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
of
respondent,
yes.
number
two
the
offense
of
murder,
rape,
armed
robbery
and
kidnapping
was
committed
while
the
offender
was
engaged
in
the
commission
of
another
capital
felony
of
aggravated
battery,
or
the
offense
of
murder
while
is
committed
while
the
offender
was
engaged
in
the
commission
of
burglary
or
arson
in
the
first
degree.
this
was
given
to
this
jury.

was
not
given
an
then
four
was
purported
to
be
given
and
a
comparison
of
this
with
what
was
actually
given
at
leaves
much
to
be
desired,
but
the
offender
committed
the
offense
of
murder
for
himself
or
another
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
money
are
the
thing
of
monetary
value.
your
honors
the
only
proof
of
the
taking
of
the
money,
of
any
money
was
possibly
that
contained
in
the
exculpatory
statement
taken
in
north
carolina
and
then
they
purported
a
transaction
out
in
the
early
morning
that
gregg
denied.
seven,
the
offense
of
murder,
rape,
armed
robbery,
kidnapping
was
outrageously
or
wantonly
vile,
horrible
or
inhuman
in
that
it
involved
torture,
depravity
of
mind,
or
an
aggravated
battery
to
the
victim.
aggravated
battery
under
georgia
law
that
they
could
cover
almost
anything
from
the
touching
if
it
had
intend
to
commit
harm.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
this
was
given
in
the
instructions
your
honor.
numbers
two,
four
and
seven
were
given
and
they
were
returned.
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
important
that
here
this
georgia
statute
sets
and
enumerates
these
ten
and
some
reference
has
made
as
to
this
being
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
but
in
the
introduction,
there
is
no
limitation
on
the
aggravating
circumstances
otherwise
authorized
by
law,
court
law
or
jurisdiction.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
this
is
at
the
top
of
the
page
mr.
chief
justice
on
the
along
b27,
25,
34
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
i
think
it
is
--
it
creates
the
confusion
of
what
i
have
if
you
are
going
to
enumerate
the
statutory
condition.
why
go
back
and
cover
the
whole
code
from
a
to
z
as
might
be
authorized
by
law
and
if
we
are
going
to
do
this,
either
we
leave
mitigating
circumstances
undefined
anywhere.
now,
is
this
uncertainty
that
permeates
and
we
submit
that
the
statute
cannot
meet
the
firm
indecision.
with
that
your
honor,
we
submit
that
under
this
circumstances
that
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
ultimate
question
of
the
death
penalty
under
eight
amendment,
even
though
we
say
that
even
there
we
question
the
sufficiency
of
proof
to
justify
the
taking
of
human
life.
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right.
whatever
a
man
has
done,
he
pays
his
penalty
and
we
submit
the
court
that
there
is
a
real
eight
amendment
issue
and
that
is
not
to
be
tested,
but
what
a
general
assembly
thinks
is
to
be
tested
by
an
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
i
would
submit
that
a
more
proper
test
and
i
submit
that
this
court
has
consistently
held
it
when
you
take
away
a
right
that
the
burden
not
necessarily
be
upon
the
person
accused.
traditionally
the
authority
of
an
individual
accused
with
a
crime
in
this
country
to
stand
mute
and
be
clothed
with
a
protection
of
the
constitution.
he
does
not
have
to
say
i
am
not
guilty.
he
does
not
have
to
say
anything,
but
i
am
here
and
he
does
not
have
to
say
that.
that
the
cloak
of
the
constitution
protects
it
and
when
we
loose
sight
if
this
that
the
state
in
order
to
come
to
remove
any
facet
of
and
particularly
the
life,
the
most
precious
thing
he
has
that
the
state
must
prove
it.
i
submit
in
conclusion
your
honor,
that
the
weems
case
and
the
robinson
case
and
really
the
dulles
case
show
that
this
court
can
take
and
can
consider
any
punishment
imposable
under
the
judicial
system
in
this
country
today
and
you
can
place
it
in
the
ballots
of
does
it
meet
the
test
of
the
eight
amendment,
without
any
apology
to
anyone,
anywhere
and
that
is
where
this
comes
down
to.
the
bottom
line
is,
is
it
justified
or
had
the
government
proving
that
it
is
such
a
punishment,
has
it
proven
that
there
is
such
a
deterrent
that
in
1976
that
we
will
continue
to
impose
the
death
penalty
under
such
conditions
when
we
do
not
know
for
sure.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
hughel
harrison
yes
sir,
but
i
believe
the
theory
or
the
idea
there
of
looking
into
the
punishment
is
present
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
with
that
your
honors
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
this
decision
to
follow
the
furman
line
of
cases
and
that
these
two
death
penalties
on
this
young
man
be
reversed.
thank
you.
