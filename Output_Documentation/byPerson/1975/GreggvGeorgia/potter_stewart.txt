and
that
you

been

and
how

but
let

talk
then
about

how

1
out
of
55
people
who
were

have
been

one
of

55,
their

is
that

some

justice

so
there
are
as
i
understand
your
answer,
54
people
now
under
sentence
of
death
in
georgia,
but
some
of
whose
convictions
have
not
yet
been
reviewed
on
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
any
for
robbery,
i
know
for
these
robberies
death
sentences
were
set
aside
as
an
comparability
basis
and
that
would
imply
that
there
are
no
death
sentences
for
robbery,
although
the
statute
does
provide
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
did
not
quite
say
that
it
would,
that
under
georgia
law
it
could
never
be
imposed,
no
reason
why
it
should,
it
said
that?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
i
have
filled
for
myself,
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
concur
in
the
judgment
and
agree
that
the
sentence
in
this
case
should
be
sustained.
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
agree
with
a
plurality
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
any
in
all
circumstances.
it
was
not
thought
to
be
at
the
time
eighth
amendment
was
adopted,
and
the
recent
decisions,
35
state
legislatures
to
authorize
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
under
various
narrowly
defined
circumstances,
we
feud
any
argument
the
death
penalty
has
become
cruel
and
unusual
as
our
society’s
standards
of
decency
have
evolved
since
the
eighth
amendment
adoption.
reasonable
men
and
reasonable
legislatures
may
differ
on
the
question
whether
the
death
penalty
serves
to
deter
murders
or
serves
any
other
valid
penological
interest.
but
so
long
as
the
penalty
is
imposed
with
some
reasonable
consistency
with
respect
to
a
given
category
of
murder,
resolution
of
this
question
at
least
on
the
present
evidence
is
simply
not
for
this
court
but
for
the
states
and
for
congress
who
are
quite
plead
to
reject
capital
punishment
and
phase
he
has
fit.
petitioner's
other
major
arguments
in
this
case
is
that
the
issue
of
sentencing
under
the
georgia’s
scheme
is
controlled
by
such
vague
and
in
determinant
standards
of
the
death
penalty
will
inexorably
be
imposed
in
as
discriminatory,
standardless,
and
rare
a
manner
as
it
was
imposed
under
the
scheme
that
was
declared
invalid
in
furman.
like
the
puerility,
we
do
not
agree.
the
georgia
legislature
has
made
an
effort
to
identify
those
aggravating
factors
which
is
considered
necessary
and
relevant
to
the
question
whether
a
defendant
convicted
of
capital
murder
should
be
sentenced
to
death.
it
has
plainly
made
an
effort
to
guide
the
jury
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
invested
in
it
and
we
can
not
accept
the
naked
assertion
that
the
effort
is
bound
to
fail
because
the
jury
will
so
often
and
systematically
refuse
to
follow
the
guidelines
laid
down
for
it.
as
the
types
of
murders
for
which
the
death
penalty
maybe
imposed
become
more
narrowly
defined,
and
are
limited
to
those
which
are
particularly
appropriate
as
they
are
in
georgia
by
reason
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
requirement,
it
becomes
reasonably
to
expect
the
jury
even
given
the
discretion
not
to
imposed
the
death
penalty,
will
impose
it
in
a
substantial
portion
of
the
cases
so
defind.
if
they
do,
this
can
no
longer
be
said
that
the
penalty
is
being
imposed
wantonly,
freakishly,
and
so
infrequently
that
it
loses
its
usefulness
as
a
sentencing
device.
there
is
therefore
a
reason
to
expect
that
georgia’s
current
system
will
escape
the
infirmities
which
were
found
to
invalidate
its
previous
system
under
furman.
in
addition
to
jury
guidance,
the
legislature
has
also
assigned
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
the
important
role
of
insuring
that
capital
punishment
will
not
be
imposed
in
a
discriminatory
or
standardless
fashion.
there
is
discretion
in
the
georgia
system
to
be
sure,
but
at
this
juncture,
we
cannot
conclude
that
it
threatens
to
invalidates
the
statute.
in
reaching
this
result
however,
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
i,
and
as
i
understand
mr.
justice
blackmun
who
also
concurs
in
the
judgment,
he
is
in
like
posture,
do
not
find
it
necessary
in
effect
to
overrule
mcgautha
v.
california,
decided
only
a
few
terms
ago
and
to
demand
as
a
constitutional
requirement
that
capital
punishment
be
imposed
only
after
a
separate
sentencing
proceeding
conducted
and
structured
as
our
brothers
stewart,
powell,
stevens
would
have
it.
for
us
at
least
where
a
first
degree
murderer
is
involved,
it
is
enough
to
be
consistent
with
furman
and
with
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
that
the
state
required
the
death
penalty
be
imposed
with
reasonable
consistency
for
a
given
category
of
crime.
this
the
georgia
statute
does
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court.
as
i
have
indicated
mr.
justice
blackmun
also
concurs
in
the
judgment
but
for
the
reasons
stated
in
dissent
in
furman
v.
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
troy
leon
gregg,
petitioner
against
the
state
of
georgia,
there
is
no
opinion
for
the
court.
however,
mr.
justice
powell,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
have
filed
a
joint
opinion
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
which
has
the
divisions
among
the
court,
is
the
–
in
summarizing
our
opinion
in
this
case,
i
speak
as
much
for
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens
as
i
do
for
myself,
this
as
i
say
is
a
joint
opinion.
the
issue
in
this
case,
whether
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
of
death
for
the
crime
of
murder
under
the
law
of
georgia
violates
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
petitioner,
troy
gregg,
was
charged
with
committing
armed
robbery
and
murder.
in
accordance
with
georgia
procedure,
in
capital
cases,
the
trial
was
in
two
stages,
a
guilt
stage
and
a
sentencing
stage.
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
at
the
guilt
stage
established
that
on
november
21,
1973,
the
petitioner
murdered
and
robbed
two
men
in
the
gwinnett
county,
georgia
and
the
jury
at
the
end
of
the
trial
from
the
petitioner
guilty
on
two
counts
of
armed
robbery
and
murder.
at
the
penalty
stage,
which
took
place
before
the
same
jury,
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
it
could
recommend
either
a
death
sentence
or
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
on
each
count.
the
judge
further
charged
the
jury
that
in
determining
what
sentence
was
appropriate,
the
jury
was
free
to
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
presented
by
the
parties,
if
any,
in
mitigation
or
aggravation.
finally,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
it
would
not
be
authorized
to
consider
imposing
the
sentence
of
death
unless
it
first
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
one
of
three
relevant
statutory,
aggravating
circumstances.
finding
two
of
these
circumstances
,
the
jury
returned
verdicts
of
death
on
each
count.
we
consider,
at
the
outset,
the
basic
contention
that
the
punishment
of
death
for
the
crime
of
murder
is
under
all
circumstances
cruel
and
unusual
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
for
the
reasons
that
mr.
justice
powell
will
summarize
thoroughly
in
announcing
our
opinion
in
the
case
of
proffitt
against
florida,
we
reject
that
contention.
we,
therefore,
must
consider
the
specific
constitutionality
of
georgia's
capital
sentencing
procedures.
in
the
wake
of
this
court's
judgment
in
the
furman
case
four
years
ago,
georgia
narrowed
the
class
of
murderers
subject
to
capital
punishment
by
specifying
10
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
at
least
one
of
which
must
be
found
by
the
jury
to
exist
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
a
death
sentence
can
ever
be
imposed.
in
addition,
the
jury
is
authorized
to
consider
any
other
appropriate
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstances.
the
jury
is
not
required
to
find
any
mitigating
circumstance
in
order
to
make
a
recommendation
of
mercy
that
is
binding
on
the
trial
court,
but
it
must
find
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
before
recommending
a
sentence
of
death.
these
procedures
require
the
jury
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
of
the
criminal
before
it
recommends
the
sentence.
no
longer
can
a
georgia
jury
do
as
furman's
jury
did,
reach
a
finding
of
the
defendant's
guilt
and
then,
without
guidance
or
direction,
decide
whether
he
should
live
or
die.
instead,
the
jury's
attention
is
directed
to
the
specific
circumstances
of
the
crime.
was
it
committed
in
the
course
of
another
capital
felony?
was
it
committed
for
money?
was
it
committed
upon
a
peace
officer
or
judicial
officer?
was
it
committed
in
a
particularly
heinous
way
or
in
a
manner
that
endangered
the
lives
of
many
persons?
in
addition,
the
jury's
attention
is
focused
on
the
characteristics
of
the
person
who
committed
the
crime.
does
he
have
a
record
of
prior
convictions
for
capital
offenses?
are
there
any
special
facts
about
this
defendant
that
mitigate
against
imposing
capital
punishment,
such
as
his
youth
or
his
emotional
state
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
as
a
result,
while
some
jury
discretion
still
exists,
the
discretion
to
be
exercised
is
controlled
by
clear
and
objective
standards
so
as
to
produce
insofar
as
possible,
non-discriminatory
application.
as
an
important
additional
safeguard
against
arbitrariness
and
caprice,
the
georgia
statutory
scheme
provides
for
automatic
appeal
of
all
death
sentences
to
the
state's
supreme
court.
that
court
is
required
by
statute
to
review
each
sentence
of
death
and
to
determine
whether
it
was
imposed
under
the
influence
of
passion
or
prejudice,
whether
the
evidence
supports
the
jury's
finding
of
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
and
whether
the
sentence
is
disproportionate
compared
to
those
sentences
imposed
in
similar
cases.
in
short,
georgia's
new
sentencing
procedures
require
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
specific
jury
findings
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
character
of
the
criminal.
moreover,
to
guard
against
--
to
guard
further
against
a
situation
comparable
to
that
presented
in
the
furman
case,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
compares
each
death
sentence
with
the
sentences
imposed
on
similarly
situated
defendants
to
ensure
that
the
sentence
of
death
in
a
particular
case
is
not
disproportionate.
the
basic
concern
of
the
furman
decision
centered
on
those
defendants
who
were
being
condemned
to
death
capriciously
and
arbitrarily.
under
the
procedures
before
the
court
in
that
case,
juries
were
not
directed
to
give
attention
to
the
nature
or
circumstances
of
the
crime
committed
or
to
the
character
or
record
of
the
defendant.
left
unguided,
juries
imposed
the
death
sentence
in
a
way
that
could
only
be
called
freakish.
the
new
georgia
sentencing
procedures,
by
contrast,
focus
the
jury's
attention
on
the
particularized
nature
of
the
crime
and
the
particularized
characteristics
of
the
individual
defendant.
while
the
jury
is
permitted
to
consider
any
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstances,
it
must
find
and
must
identify
at
least
one
statutory
aggravating
factor
before
it
may
impose
a
penalty
of
death.
in
this
way
the
jury's
discretion
is
channeled.
no
longer,
therefore,
can
a
jury
wantonly
and
freakishly
impose
the
death
sentence.
it
is
always
circumscribed
by
the
legislative
guidelines.
in
addition,
the
review
function
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affords
additional
assurance
that
the
constitutional
concerns
that
prompted
our
decision
in
furman
are
not
present
in
the
georgia
procedure
applied
in
this
case.
for
the
reasons
i
have
summarized
which
are
set
out
at
considerable
in
the
written
opinion,
that
mr.
justice
powell,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
have
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
statutory
system
under
which
gregg
was
sentenced
to
death
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
he
will
shortly
announce
orally.
