justice
thurgood
marshall
in
furman
against
georgia,
i
concluded
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
prohibited
by
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
that
continues
to
be
my
view.
in
furman,
i
concluded
that
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons.
first
the
death
penalty
is
excessive
and
second,
the
american
people
fully
informed
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
death
penalty's
liabilities
in
my
view
rejected
as
morally
unacceptable.
since
the
decision
in
furman,
the
legislature
of
35
states
have
indeed
enacted
new
statutes
authorizing
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
for
certain
crimes
and
congress
has
enacted
the
law
of
providing
the
death
penalty
for
the
piracy
resulting
in
death.
i
would
be
less
and
candid,
if
i
did
not
acknowledge
that
these
developments
have
a
significant
bearing
on
a
realistic
assessment
of
the
moral
acceptability
of
the
death
penalty
to
the
american
people.
but
if
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
turns,
as
i
have
urged,
on
the
opinion
of
an
informed
citizenry,
then
even
the
enactment
of
new
death
statutes
cannot
in
and
off
themselves
be
viewed
as
conclusive.
in
furman,
i
observed
that
the
american
people
are
largely
unaware
of
the
information
critical
to
a
judgment
on
the
morality
of
the
death
penalty,
and
there
i
concluded
that
if
they
were
better
informed
they
would
consider
it
shocking,
unjust,
and
unacceptable.
a
recent
study
has
confirmed
that
the
american
people
know
little
about
the
death
penalty,
and
that
the
opinions
of
an
informed
public
would
differ
significantly
from
those
of
a
public
unaware
of
the
consequences
and
effects
of
the
death
penalty.
even
assuming,
however,
that
the
post-furman
enactments
and
statutes,
authorizing
the
death
penalty,
renders
the
prediction
of
the
views
of
an
informed
citizenry,
uncertain
basis
for
a
constitutional
decision,
the
enactment
of
these
statutes
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
conclusion
that
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
excessive.
an
excessive
penalty
is
valid
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
even
though
popular
sentiment
may
favor
it.
the
inquiry
here,
then,
is
simply
whether
the
death
penalty
is
necessary
to
accomplish
legitimate
legislative
purposes
in
punishment,
and
whether
a
less
severe
penalty
such
as
life
imprisonment
would
do
as
well.
the
two
purposes
that
sustain
the
death
penalty
as
nonexcessive
in
the
court's
view
are
general
deterrence
and
retribution.
in
furman,
i
canvassed
the
relevant
data
on
the
deterrent
effect
of
capital
punishment.
the
state
of
knowledge
at
that
point,
after
literally
centuries
of
debate,
was
summarized
in
the
united
nations
committee.
which
committee
said,
it
is
generally
agreed
between
the
retentionists
and
abolitionists,
whatever
their
opinions
about
the
validity
of
comparative
studies
of
deterrence,
that
the
data
which
now
exists
show
no
correlation
between
the
existence
of
capital
punishment
and
lower
rates
of
capital
crime.
i
concluded
in
furman
and
i
conclude
today,
that
the
available
evidence
is
simply
convincing
that
capital
punishment
is
not
necessary
as
a
deterrent
to
crime
in
our
society.
the
other
principal
purpose
said
to
be
served
by
the
death
penalties
retribution.
the
notion
that
retribution
can
serve
as
a
moral
justification
for
the
cessation
of
death
finds
credence
in
the
opinion
of
my
brothers
stewart,
powell,
and
stevens
and
that
of
my
brother
white.
it
is
this
notion
that
i
find
to
be
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
today's
unfortunate
decision.
my
brothers
stewart,
powell
and
stevens
after
the
following
explanation
of
the
retributive
justification
for
capital
punishment
have
this
to
say.
“the
instinct
for
retribution
is
part
of
the
nature
of
man,
and
challenging
that
instinct
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
serves
an
important
purpose
in
promoting
the
stability
of
a
society
governed
by
law.
when
people
begin
to
believe
that
organized
society
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
impose
upon
criminal
offenders
the
punishment
they
deserve,
then
there
are
sown
the
seeds
of
anarchy
or
self-help,
vigilante
justice,
and
lynch
law.”
this
statement
is
wholly
inadequate
to
justify
the
death
penalty.
as
my
brother
brennan
stated
in
furman,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
utilization
of
imprisonment
rather
than
death
encourages
private
blood
feuds
and
other
disorders.
it
simply
defies
belief
to
suggest
that
the
death
penalty
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
american
people
from
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands.
in
a
related
vein,
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
expression
of
moral
outrage
through
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
serves
to
reinforce
basic
moral
values.
there
it
announces
in
the
strongest
possible
way
that
murderer
is
wrong,
and
therefore,
to
be
avoided.
well,
this
contention,
like
the
previous
one,
provides
no
support
for
the
death
penalty.
it
is
inconceivable
than
any
individual
concerned
about
conforming
his
conduct
to
what
society
says
is
right
would
fail
to
realize
that
murder
is
wrong
if
the
death
penalty
were
simply
real
true
life
imprisonment.
there
remains
for
consideration,
what
might
be
termed
“a
purely
retributive
justification
for
the
death
penalty.
that
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate,
not
because
of
its
beneficial
effect
on
society,
but
because
the
taking
of
the
murderer's
life
is
itself
morally
good.”
some
of
the
language
of
the
plurality
opinion
appears
positively
to
embrace
a
notion,
a
retribution
for
its
own
and
as
a
justification
for
capital
punishment.
the
opinion
of
plurality
had
said,
“the
decisions
that
capital
punishment
may
be
the
appropriate
sanction
in
extreme
cases
is
the
expression
of
the
community's
belief
that
certain
crimes
are
themselves
so
grievous
and
an
affront
to
humanity
that
the
only
adequate
response
may
be
the
penalty
of
death."
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
the
argument,
society's
judgment
that
murderer
deserves
death
must
be
respected
not
simply
because
the
preservation
of
order
requires
it,
but
because
it
is
appropriate
that
society
make
the
judgment
and
carry
it
out.
it
is
this
latter
notion,
in
particular,
that
i
consider
to
be
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
eighth
amendment.
the
mere
fact
that
the
community
demands
the
murderer's
life
in
return
for
the
evil
he
has
done
cannot
sustain
the
death
penalty,
for
as
the
plurality
reminds
us,
"the
eighth
amendment
demands
more
than
that
a
challenged
punishment
be
acceptable
to
contemporary
society."
to
be
sustained
under
the
eighth
amendment,
the
death
penalty
must
be
comport
with
the
basic
concept
of
human
dignity
at
the
core
of
amendment.
the
objection
on
opposition
to
it
must
be
consistent
with
our
respect
for
the
dignity
of
other
man.
under
these
standards,
the
taking
of
life
because
the
wrongdoer
deserves
it,
surely
must
fall
for
such
a
punishment
has
as
its
very
basis
the
total
denial
of
the
wrongdoer's
dignity
and
worth.
the
death
penalty,
unnecessary
to
promote
the
goal
of
deterrence
or
to
further
any
legitimate
notion
of
retribution,
is
an
excessive
penalty
forbidden
by
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
i
therefore,
respectfully
dissent.
