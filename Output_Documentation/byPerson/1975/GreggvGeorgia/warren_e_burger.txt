chief

e.

in
the
first
of
these
cases,
troy
leon
gregg,
the
petitioner,
against
the
state
of
georgia,
there
is
no
opinion
for
the
court,
however
mr.
justice
powell,
mr.
justice
stevens
and
i
have
filed
a
joint
opinion
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
which
because
of
the
divisions
among
the
court,
is
the
prevailing
decision.
in
summarizing
our
opinion
in
this
case
i
speak
as
much
for
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
stevens
as
i
do
for
myself
this
is
i
say
is
a
joint
opinion.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
impositions
of
the
sentence
of
death
for
the
crime
of
murder
under
the
law
of
georgia
violates
the
eight
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
petitioner
troy
gregg
was
charged
with
committing
armed
robbery
and
murder.
in
accordance
with
georgia
procedure
and
capital
cases,
the
trial
was
in
two
stages:
a
guilt
stage
and
a
sentencing
stage.
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
at
the
guilt
stage
established
that
on
november
21st,
1973
the
petitioner
murdered
and
robbed
two
men
in
gwinnett
county,
georgia,
and
the
jury
at
the
end
of
the
trial
found
that
the
petitioner
guilty
on
two
counts
of
armed
robbery
and
murder.
at
the
penalty
stage
which
took
place
before
the
same
jury,
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
it
could
recommend
either
a
death
sentence
or
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
on
each
count.
the
judge
further
charged
the
jury
that
in
determining
what
sentence
was
appropriate,
the
jury
was
free
to
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
presented
by
the
parties,
if
any,
in
mitigation
or
aggravation.
finally,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
it
would
not
be
authorized
to
consider
imposing
the
sentence
of
death
unless
it
first
found
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
one
of
three
relevant
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
finding
two
of
these
circumstances,
the
jury
return
verdicts
of
death
on
each
count.
we
consider
at
the
outset
the
basic
contention
that
the
punishment
of
death
for
the
crime
of
murder
is
under
all
circumstance,
cruel
and
un-usual
and
violation
of
the
constitution.
for
the
reasons
that
mr.
justice
powell
will
summarize
thoroughly
in
announcing
our
opinion
in
the
case
of
proffitt
against
florida,
we
reject
that
contention.
we
therefore
must
consider
the
specific
constitutionality
of
georgia’s
capital
sentencing
procedures.
in
the
wake
of
this
court’s
judgment
in
the
furman
case
four
years
ago,
georgia
narrowed
the
class
of
murderers
subject
to
capital
punishment
by
specifying
ten
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
at
least
one
of
which
must
be
found
by
the
jury
to
exist
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
before
a
death
sentence
can
ever
be
imposed.
in
addition
the
jury
is
authorized
to
consider
any
other
appropriate
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstances.
the
jury
is
not
required
to
find
any
mitigating
circumstance
in
order
to
make
a
recommendation
of
mercy
that
is
binding
on
trial
court,
but
it
must
find
a
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
before
recommending
a
sentence
of
death.
these
procedures
require
the
jury
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
other
criminal
before
it
recommends
sentence.
no
longer
can
a
georgia
jury
do
as
furman’s
jury
did,
reach
in
finding
of
the
defendants
guilt
and
then
without
guidance
or
direction
decide
whether
he
should
live
or
die.
instead
the
jury’s
attention
is
directed
to
the
specific
circumstances
of
the
crime.
was
it
committed
in
the
course
of
another
capital
felony?
was
it
committed
for
money?
was
it
committed
upon
a
peace
officer,
or
judicial
officer?
was
it
committed
in
a
particularly
heinous
way
or
in
a
manner
that
endangered
the
lives
of
many
persons?
in
addition,
the
jury’s
attention
is
focused
on
the
characteristics
of
the
person
who
committed
the
crime.
does
he
have
a
record
of
prior
convictions
for
capital
offences?
are
there
any
special
facts
about
this
defendant
that
mitigate
against
imposing
capital
punishment
such
as
his
youth
or
his
emotional
state
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
as
a
result,
while
some
jury
discretion
still
exists,
the
discretion
to
be
exercised
is
controlled
by
player
and
objective
standards
so
as
to
produce
and
so
far
as
possible
non
discriminatory
application.
as
an
important
additional
safeguard
against
arbitrariness
and
caprice,
the
georgia
statutory
scheme
provides
for
automatic
appeal
of
all
death
sentences
to
the
state’s
supreme
court.
that
court
is
required
by
statute
to
review
each
sentence
of
death
and
to
determine
whether
it
was
imposed
under
the
influence
of
passion
or
prejudice,
whether
the
evidence
supports
the
jury’s
finding
of
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
and
whether
the
sentence
is
disproportionate
compare
to
those
sentences
imposed
in
similar
cases.
in
short,
georgia’s
new
sentencing
procedures
require
as
a
pre-requisite
to
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
specific
jury
findings
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
character
of
the
criminal.
moreover
to
guard
against,
to
guard
further
against
a
situation
comparable
to
that
presented
in
the
furman
case,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
compares
each
day
of
death
sentence
with
the
sentences
imposed
on
similarly
situated
defendants,
to
insure
that
the
sentence
of
death
in
a
particular
case
is
not
disproportionate.
the
basic
concern
of
the
furman
decision
centered
on
those
defendants
who
are
being
condemned
to
deaths
capriciously
and
arbitrarily.
under
the
procedures
before
the
court
in
that
case,
juries
were
not
directed
to
give
attention
to
the
nature
or
circumstances
of
the
crime
committed
or
to
the
character
or
record
of
the
defendant.
left
un-guided,
juries
imposed
the
death
sentence
in
a
way
that
can
only
be
called
freakish.
the
new
georgia
sentencing
procedures
by
contrast
focused
the
juries’
attention
on
the
particularized
nature
of
the
crime
and
the
particularized
characteristics
of
the
individual
defendant.
while
the
jury
is
permitted
to
consider
any
aggravating
or
mitigating
circumstances,
it
must
find
and
must
identify
at
least
one
statutory
aggravating
factor
before
it
may
impose
a
penalty
of
death.
in
this
way
the
juries’
discretion
is
channeled
no
longer
therefore
can
a
jury
wantonly
and
freakishly
imposed
the
death
sentence
it
is
always
circumscribed
by
the
legislative
guidelines.
in
addition,
the
review
function
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affords
additional
assurance
that
the
constitutional
concerns
that
prompted
our
decision
in
furman
are
not
present
in
the
georgia
procedure
applied
in
this
case.
for
the
reasons
i
have
summarized,
which
are
set
out
at
considerable
lengths
in
the
written
opinion
the
mr.
justice
powell,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
i
have
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
statutory
system
under
which
gregg
was
sentenced
to
death
does
not
violate
the
constitution.
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
he
will
shortly
announce
orally.
