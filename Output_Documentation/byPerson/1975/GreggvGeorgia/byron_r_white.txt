justice
byron
r.
white
in
furman
against
georgia,
i
concluded
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
prohibited
by
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
that
continues
to
be
my
view.
in
furman
i
concluded
that
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons:
first,
the
death
penalty
is
excessive;
and
second,
the
american
people
fully
informed
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
death
penalty
and
its
liabilities,
would
in
my
view
reject
it
as
morally
unacceptable.
since
the
decision
in
furman,
the
legislatures
of
35
states
have
indeed
enacted
new
statutes
authorizing
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
for
certain
crimes,
and
congress
has
enacted
a
law
providing
the
death
penalty
for
the
piracy
resulting
in
death.
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
did
not
acknowledge
that
these
developments
have
a
significant
bearing
on
a
realistic
assessment
of
the
moral
acceptability
of
the
death
penalty
to
the
american
people.
but
if
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
turns,
as
i
have
urged,
on
the
opinion
of
an
informed
citizenry,
then
even
the
enactment
of
new
death
statutes
cannot,
in
of
themselves,
be
viewed
as
conclusive.
in
furman,
i
observed
that
the
american
people
are
largely
unaware
of
the
information
critical
to
a
judgment
on
the
morality
of
a
death
penalty.
they
are
concluded
that
if
they
were
better
informed
they
will
consider
it
shocking,
unjust,
and
unacceptable.
a
recent
study
has
confirmed
that
the
american
people
know
little
about
the
death
penalty,
and
that
the
opinions
of
an
informed
public
would
differ
significantly
from
those
of
a
public
unaware
of
the
consequences
and
effects
of
the
death
penalty
even
assuming
however,
that
the
post
furman
enactment
statues
authorizing
the
death
penalty,
renders
the
prediction
of
the
views
of
an
informed
citizenry,
uncertain
basis
for
constitutional
decision,
the
enactment
of
these
statutes
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
conclusion
that
the
death
penalty
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
excessive.
an
excessive
penalty
is
invalid
under
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
even
though
popular
sentiment
may
favor
it.
the
inquiry
here
then
is
simply
whether
the
death
penalty
is
necessary
to
accomplish
the
legitimate
legislative
purposes
in
punishment
or
whether
a
less
severe
penalty
such
as
life
imprisonment
would
do
just
as
well.
the
two
purposes
that
sustain
the
death
penalty
as
nonexcessive
in
the
court's
view
are
general
deterrence
and
retribution.
in
furman,
i
canvassed
the
relevant
data
on
the
deterrent
effect
of
capital
punishment.
the
state
of
knowledge
at
that
point,
after
literally
centuries
of
debate,
was
summarized
in
the
united
nations
committee,
which
committee
said
"it
is
generally
agreed
between
the
retentionists
and
abolitionists,
whatever
their
opinions
about
the
validity
of
comparative
studies
of
deterrence,
that
the
data
which
now
exist
show
no
correlation
between
the
existence
of
capital
punishment
and
lower
rates
of
capital
crime."
i
concluded
in
furman
and
i
conclude
today,
that
the
available
evidence
is
simply
convincing
that
capital
punishment
is
not
necessary
as
a
deterrent
crime
in
our
society.
the
other
principal
purpose
said
to
be
served
by
the
death
penalty
is
retribution.
the
notion
that
retribution
can
serve
as
a
moral
justification
for
the
sanction
of
death
finds
credence
in
the
opinion
of
my
brothers,
stewart,
powell,
and
stevens,
and
that
of
my
brother
white.
it
is
this
notion
that
i
find
to
be
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
today's
unfortunate
decisions.
my
brother
stevens
--
stewart,
powell
and
stevens,
after
their
following
explanation
of
the
retributive
justification
for
capital
punishment
had
this
to
say:
"the
instinct
for
retribution
is
part
of
the
nature
of
man,
and
channeling
that
instinct
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
serves
an
important
purpose
in
promoting
the
stability
of
a
society
governed
by
law.
when
people
begin
to
believe
that
organized
society
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
impose
upon
criminal
offenders
the
punishment
they
deserve,
then
there
are
sown
the
seeds
of
anarchy
of
self-help,
vigilante
justice,
and
lynch
law."
this
statement
is
wholly
inadequate
to
justify
the
death
penalty.
as
my
brother
brennan
stated
in
furman,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
utilization
of
imprisonment
rather
that
death
encourages
private
blood
feuds
and
other
disorders.
it
simply
defies
belief
to
suggest
that
the
death
penalty
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
american
people
from
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands.
in
a
related
vein,
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
expression
of
moral
outrage
through
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
serves
to
reinforce
basic
moral
values
there
it
announces
in
the
strongest
possible
way
that
murder
is
wrong
and
therefore
to
be
avoided.
well
this
contention,
like
the
previous
one,
provides
no
support
for
the
death
penalty.
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
individual
concerned
about
conforming
his
conduct
to
what
society
says
is
"right"
would
fail
to
realize
that
murder
is
"wrong"
if
the
death
penalty
was
simply
reeled
through
life
imprisonment.
"there
remains
for
consideration
what
might
be
termed
the
purely
retributive
justification
for
the
death
penalty
that
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate,
not
because
of
its
beneficial
effect
on
society
but
because
the
taking
of
a
murderer's
life
is
itself
morally
good."
some
of
the
language
of
the
plurality
opinion
appears
positively
to
embrace
the
notion
of
retribution
for
its
own
and
as
a
justification
for
capital
punishment.
and
the
opinion
of
plurality
said,
"the
decision
that
capital
punishment
may
be
the
appropriate
sanction
in
extreme
cases
is
an
expression
of
the
community's
belief
that
certain
crimes
are
themselves
so
grievous
an
affront
to
humanity
that
the
only
adequate
response
may
be
the
penalty
of
death."
in
other
words
as
i
understand
the
argument,
societyâ€™s
judgment
that
murderer
deserves
death
must
be
respected
not
simply
because
the
preservation
of
order
requires
it,
but
because
it
is
appropriate
that
society
make
the
judgment
and
carry
it
out.
it
is
this
latter
notion
in
particular
that
i
consider
to
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
eighth
amendment.
the
mere
fact
that
the
community
demands
the
murderer's
life
in
return
for
the
evil
he
has
done
cannot
sustain
the
death
penalty,
for
as
the
plurality
reminds
us
"the
eighth
amendment
demands
more
than
a
challenged
punishment
be
acceptable
to
contemporary
society."
to
be
sustained
under
the
eighth
amendment,
the
death
penalty
must
be
comport
with
the
basic
concept
of
human
dignity
at
the
core
of
the
amendment.
the
objection
and
opposition
to
it
must
be
consistent
with
our
respect
for
the
dignity
of
other
man.
under
these
standards,
the
taking
of
life
because
wrongdoer
deserves
it
surely
must
fall
for
such
a
punishment
has
as
its
very
basis
the
total
denial
of
the
wrongdoer's
dignity,
and
worth.
the
death
penalty,
unnecessary
to
promote
the
goal
of
deterrence
or
to
further
any
legitimate
notion
of
retribution,
is
an
excessive
penalty
forbidden
by
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
and
i
therefore
respectfully
dissent.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
i
have
filed
for
myself,
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
concur
in
a
judgment
and
agree
that
the
sentence
in
this
case
should
be
sustained.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
agree
with
the
plurality
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
any
and
all
circumstances.
it
was
not
thought
to
be
at
the
time
the
eighth
amendment
was
adopted
and
the
recent
decisions
of
35
state
legislatures
to
authorize
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
under
various
narrowly
defined
circumstances
refute
any
argument
that
the
death
penalty
has
become
cruel
and
unusual
as
our
society
standards
of
decency
have
evolved
since
the
eight
amendment's
adoption.
reasonable
men
and
reasonable
legislatures
may
differ
on
the
question
whether
the
death
penalty
serves
to
deter
murders
or
serves
any
other
valid
penalogical
interest.
but
so
long
as
the
penalty
is
imposed
with
some
reasonable
consistency
with
respect
to
a
given
category
of
murder,
resolution
of
this
question,
at
least
on
the
present
evidence
is
simply
not
for
this
court,
but
for
the
states
and
for
congress
who
are
quite
free
to
to
reject
capital
punishment
if
they
fit.
petitioner's
other
major
argument
in
this
case
is
that
the
issue
of
sentencing
under
the
georgia
scheme
is
controlled
by
such
vague
and
indeterminant
standards
of
the
death
penalty
will
inextricably
be
imposed
in
as
discriminatory,
standardless
and
rarely
manner
as
it
was
imposed
under
the
scheme
that
was
declared
invalid
in
furman.
like
the
plurality,
we
do
not
agree.
the
georgia
legislature
has
made
an
effort
to
identify
those
aggravating
factors
which
it
considers
necessary
and
relevant
to
the
question
whether
a
defendant
convicted
of
capital
murder
should
be
sentenced
to
death.
it
has
plainly
made
an
effort
to
guide
the
jury
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
vested
in
it
and
we
cannot
accept
the
naked
assertion
that
the
effort
is
bound
to
fail,
because
the
jury
will
so
often
can
systematically
refuse
to
follow
the
guidelines
laid
down
for
it.
as
the
types
of
murders
for
which
the
death
penalty
may
be
imposed
become
more
narrowly
defined
and
are
limited
to
those
which
are
particularly
appropriate
as
they
are
in
georgia
by
a
reason
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
requirement,
it
becomes
reasonable
to
expect
that
juries
even
given
discretion
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
will
impose
it
in
a
substantial
portion
of
the
cases
so
defined.
if
they
do,
it
can
no
longer
be
said
that
the
penalty
is
being
imposed
wantonly,
freakishly
or
so
infrequently
that
it
loses
its
usefulness
as
a
sentencing
device.
there
is,
therefore,
a
reason
to
expect
that
georgia's
current
system
will
escape
the
infirmities
which
were
found
to
invalidate
its
previous
system
under
furman.
in
addition
to
jury
guidance,
the
legislature
has
also
assigned
to
the
georgia
supreme
court,
the
important
role
of
insuring
that
capital
punishment
will
not
be
imposed
in
a
discriminatory
or
standardless
fashion.
there
is
discretion
in
the
georgia
system
to
be
sure,
but
at
this
juncture,
we
cannot
conclude
that
it
threatens
to
invalidate
the
statute.
in
reaching
this
result,
however,
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
and
as
i
understand
mr.
justice
blackmun
who
also
concurs
in
the
judgment,
he
is
in
like
posture,
do
not
find
it
necessary
in
effect
to
overrule
mcgautha
v.
california,
decided
only
a
few
terms
ago
and
to
demand
as
a
constitutional
requirement
that
capital
punishment
be
imposed
only
after
a
separate
sentencing
proceeding,
conducted
and
structured
as
our
brothers
stewart,
powell
and
stevens
would
it.
for
us,
at
least
where
a
first-degree
murder
is
involved,
it
is
enough
to
be
consistent
with
furman
and
with
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
that
the
state
requires
that
the
death
penalty
be
imposed
with
reasonable
consistency
for
a
given
category
of
crime.
this,
the
georgia
statute
does,
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
georgia
supreme
court.
as
i
have
indicated,
mr.
justice
blackmun
also
concurs
in
the
judgment,
but
for
the
reasons
stated
in
dissent
in
furman
v.
georgia.
