justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
might
i
ask
what
your
judgment
is
on
the
comparison
between
this
group
of
55,
who
now
have
received
the
death
sentence
as
to
the
pre
furman
experience
under
the
statute,
would
you
say
that
there
are
more
or
less
death
penalties
than
there
were
before?
you
have
a
judgment
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
want
you
to
state
if
you
do
not
have
a
thought
already
in
line
and
secondly
could
you
tell
us
how
many
of
the
55
are
for
rape
and
how
many
for
murder,
if
you
know?
