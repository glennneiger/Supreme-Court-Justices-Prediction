justice
blackmun
mr.
kilcullen,
are
the
operators
really
claiming
that
they
do
not
know
what
these
alleged
violations
consist
of
or
are
they
really
arguing
mitigation
here?
justice
blackmun
is
that
not
the
reason
for
requesting
a
hearing
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
randolph,
could
i
interrupt
you
here?
as
i
recall,
judge
adams
in
the
third
circuit
opinion
argued
that
the
apa
itself
requires
findings
where
there
is
a
hearing
and,
therefore,
that
under
the
secretaryâ€™s
interpretation
of
the
statutes
section
109
adds
nothing.
do
you
have
an
answer
to
that
one?
