you
mean
even
if
the
mine
operator
had,
in
writing,
expressly
purported
to
dispense
with
a
need
for
a
hearing
or
with
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
rest
on
any
constitutional
argument
below?
did
you
make
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
rejected
too,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
did
they
reject
the
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
pressing
a
constitutional
claim
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
not
ask
for
a
post-assessment
hearing
either,
i
take
it.
could
you
not
have
had
a
de
novo
hearing
before
a
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume
you
could
have.
you
did
not
find
out
whether
you
could
any
way,
whether
you
could
have
had
that
hearing
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
available
to
you,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
its
failure
to
exhaust?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
blackwell,
do
you
have
objections
to
the
new
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
they
do
not
solve
the
problem
of
past
assessments,
but
do
we
have
any
problem
in
this
case
that
is
to
the
future
validity
of
a
set
of
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
old
regulations
that
we
are
arguing
about
have
been
replaced.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
the
issue
here
with
the
past
assessments
then?
