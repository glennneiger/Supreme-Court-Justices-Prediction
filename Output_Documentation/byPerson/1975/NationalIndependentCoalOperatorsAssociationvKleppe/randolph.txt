mr.
randolph
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
d.c.
circuit
case
they
also
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
to
the
extent
that
the
court
might
hold
that
the
regulations
are
invalid
and
that,
in
turn,
might
affect
pending
cases
for
enforcement.
the
action
may
not
be
moot.
in
our
brief,
in
our
position
in
the
d.c.
circuit
case
we
pointed
out
only
that
so
longs
as
that
decision
stands
it
really
has
no
effect
outside
of
the
circuit
because
of
the
fact
that
there
are
no
mines
within
the
district
of
columbia
and,
therefore,
it
would
be
proper
for
this
court
only
to
hear
the
delta
mining
case,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
technically
moot
because
of
the
declaratory
judgment
aspect
of
it.
these
are
the
first
cases
that
have
reached
the
court
--
mr.
randolph
well,
if
the
regulations
are
held
invalid,
then
the
argument,
and
the
argument
indeed
was
in
delta
mining,
that
therefore
the
penalties
assessed
under
those
regulations
are
invalid
as
well,
and
if
those
penalties
assessed
are
invalid
then
enforcement
actions
cannot
be
sought
and
must
be
dismissed.
that
would
be
the
only
argument.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
delta
mining
case.
mr.
randolph
no,
the
regulations
were
held
invalid
in
the
delta
mining
case.
the
regulations
under
which
the
penalties
were
assessed
were
held
invalid.
these
are
the
first
cases
obviously
to
reach
the
court
involving
the
federal
coal
mine
health
and
safety
act
of
1969
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
act
is
a
culmination
of
federal
legislative
efforts
dealing
with
coal
miners
that
dates
back
to
1865.
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
cure
some
of
the
problems.
many
of
the
problems
that
led
to
the
failure
of
past
legislation.
the
purpose
of
the
act
as
well
was
to
protect
the
coal
miners,
the
primary
purpose,
to
protect
their
health
and
safety.
congress
recognizing
that
they
were
engaged
in
the
most
hazardous
occupation
within
the
united
states.
congress
found
that
between
1960
and
1968,
under
the
passed
law,
that
federal
inspectors
had
observed
1.3
million
violations
of
the
advisory
safety
code
of
the
bureau
of
mines.
one
of
the
major
problems
that
congress
identified
with,
even
enforcing
the
existing
laws
and
this
is
in
the
senate
report
right
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
report
on
this
bill,
was
that
the
enforcement
procedures
did
not
work.
congress
said
they
were
too
complex.
they
were
too
difficult.
it
made
it
impossible
to
secure
compliance
even
with
the
laws
that
were
on
the
books
at
that
time
and,
therefore,
congress
abandoned,
in
this
act,
it
abandoned
the
approach
of
seeking
voluntary
compliance.
it
imposed
125
specific
mandatory
standards
of
health
and
safety
that
coal
mine
operators
must
comply
with,
and
it
imposed
penalties
for
violations
of
those
standards.
in
order
to
make
it
no
longer
profitable
for
the
coal
mine
operators
to
continue
operating
in
violation
of
the
law,
to
make
it
no
longer
profitable
for
them
to
operate
in
violation
of
health
and
safety
standards
at
the
expense
of
the
miners.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
one
statutory
interpretation.
and
i
will
explain
later
that
it
goes
beyond
the
particular
regulations
that
are
involved
here.
the
question
specifically
is
what
does
section
109
(a)
(3)
of
this
act
require
when
the
secretary
assesses
a
penalty
in
the
absence
of
a
request
or
the
holding
of
an
administrative
hearing.
more
specifically
written
detailed
findings
of
fact
such
as
those
required
under
the
apa
after
a
hearing,
are
those
kinds
of
findings
of
fact
required
to
be
incorporated
in
the
secretary’s
assessment
order
when
there
has
been
no
hearing,
and
when,
indeed,
the
mine
operator
is
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo
in
a
district
court
on
all
issues
and
a
trial
by
jury
by
all
factual
issues?
let
me
add
right
here
at
the
outset
that
the
statement
that
i
believe
mr.
kilcullen
quoted
of
the
attorney
in
the
pretrial
proceedings
in
the
delta
mining
case
about
what
de
novo
means
is
not
the
position
of
the
government.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
de
novo
trial
on
all
issues
means
an
absolute
de
novo
trial
on
all
issues
of
fact
in
law,
that
the
administrative
proceedings
become
irrelevant;
they
wash
out.
i
would
like
to
put
this
case
in
its
proper
prospective
by
just
outlining
for
the
court
the
steps
that
lead
to
an
assessment
and
finally
the
steps
that
lead
into
the
district
courts.
we
begin
with
the
mine
inspectors
themselves
and
these
are
people
specifically
required
by
the
act
under
section
505
to
be
experienced
people
in
mining.
all
the
people
appointed
by
the
secretary
to
administer
this
act
are
required
by
the
statue
itself
to
be
experienced
mining
people.
the
mine
inspector
approaches
the
mine
without
any
advance
notice.
in
fact,
the
statute
specifically
prevents
him
from
giving
any
notice.
each
mine
within
the
united
states
must
be
inspected
entirely
four
times
a
year.
there
are
also
spot
inspections
periodically.
for
dangerous
mines
where
there
had
been
fatalities
or
serious
accidents
within
the
past
five
years,
there
must
be
a
spot
check
once
out
of
every
five
days
by
a
mine
inspector.
the
union
representative
has
an
absolute
right
to
accompany
the
mine
inspector
when
he
reaches
the
mine.
the
company
official,
i
am
told,
usually
does
as
well.
let
us
suppose
the
mine
inspector
goes
into
the
mine
shaft
and,
as
in
delta
mining
g.
m.
w.
and
the
mears
company
mines,
he
finds
violations
of
the
act.
at
that
point,
he
writes
out
a
detailed
notice
of
violation
quite
analogous,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
a
traffic
ticket.
under
section
104
(e)
of
the
act
he
is
required
to
set
down
precisely
what
he
finds
is
wrong,
what
sections
of
the
act
where
the
regulations
are
violated,
and
then
he
also
sets
a
time
for
abatement.
in
this
case,
i
notice
in
the
delta
mining
situation
the
operator
had
one
month
to
correct
that
violation.
now,
this
is
handed,
this
notice
of
violation
is
required
by
the
statute
to
be
handed
right
there
to
the
company
official,
but
that
is
not
all.
the
act
also
requires
specifically
that
the
mine
inspector
post
the
notice
of
violation
saying
what
was
wrong
and
where
in
the
mine
and
how
long
it
is
before
it
has
to
be
corrected.
he
must
post
that
notice
on
a
bulletin
board.
and,
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
careful
congress
was
in
this
detailed
act,
there
is
even
a
section
in
the
act,
107
(a)
that
requires
mine
operators
to
have
bulletin
boards,
so
they
would
not
get
into
the
problem
of
having
no
place
to
post
it.
the
bulletin
boards
must
be
right
outside
the
mine
entrance.
then,
the
mine
inspector
returns
to
check
to
see
whether
there
has
been
an
abatement,
to
check
and
see
whether
the
violation
has
in
fact
been
remedied.
if
it
has
not,
if
there
has
been
no
abatement,
then
the
mine
inspector
can
order
withdrawal
of
all
people
from
the
area
of
the
violation
or
he
can
extend
the
time
for
correcting
the
violation.
but
let
us
suppose
that
the
violation
has
been
abated.
if
that
is
done
then
the
notice
of
violation
and
the
abatement
notice
is
sent
to
the
assessment
office
of
the
bureau
of
mines.
now,
what
i
have
just
described
is
happening,
and
i
think
we
said
in
our
brief,
at
the
rate
of
80,000
times
a
year,
80,000
violations
of
the
health
and
safety
standards
of
the
act
and
regulations.
that
was
wrong.
that
figure
is
not
accurate
today
because
the
latest
figure
shows
that
the
rate
has
increased
now
to
110,000
violations
a
year.
congress
could
have
stopped
right
there.
it
could
have
led
the
--
like
a
traffic
office,
it
could
have
left
the
mine
inspector
write
out
a
fine,
serve
it
on
the
mine
operator,
and
say
“either
pay
it
or
litigate
in
district
court.”
the
apa
would
not
have
been
applicable
at
all
to
that
situation.
if
the
court
will
notice,
in
section
554
(a)
(3)
of
the
apa,
it
specifically
made
inapplicable
the
findings
of
a
fact
requirement,
the
hearing
requirement
to
situations
involving
inspections,
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
is.
it
has
also
made
inapplicable
the
apa
requirements
in
finding
of
fact
requirements
until
the
applicable
are
totally
inapplicable
when
there
is
a
trial
de
novo
in
a
district
court
available,
but
congress
did
not
stop
right
there.
now,
it
gave
another
step
in
the
process.
it
required
the
secretary
himself
to
assess
the
penalties
and
it
thought
it
advisable
to
give
the
mine
operators
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
the
way
that
has
been
operating,
the
way
it
operated
under
the
old
regulations
is
that
the
assessment
officer
would,
after
getting
a
notice
of
violation,
the
abatement
would
make
up
a
proposed
order
of
assessment,
the
assessment
officer
is
a
man,
as
i
said,
experienced
in
mining,
and
send
it
to
the
mine
operator.
it
is
not
an
order
to
pay.
he
cannot
be
required
to
pay.
it
just
says
that
you
have
15
days
to
protest
this.
in
the
delta
mining
case,
the
addendum
at
page
28
of
our
brief
shows
that
there
was
a
protest.
it
was
not
on
a
basis
that
we
did
not
violate
the
act.
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
protest
that
we
have
not
violated
the
act.
it
was
that
this
is
a
new
mine.
people
have
to
be
trained.
we
showed
good
faith
in
trying
to
abate,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
but
let
us
assume
in
the
usual
case
that
the
operator
does
protest.
if
he
does
not
protest
the
proposed
assessment
order,
then
the
order
becomes
the
final
order
of
the
secretary.
he
can
request
a
hearing
at
this
point
but
let
us
assume
that
he
does
not.
the
assessment
officer
takes
the
protest
from
the
mine
operator,
reconsiders,
and
let
us
assume,
he
reissues
the
assessment
order.
the
mine
operator,
again,
has
the
opportunity
to
request
a
hearing
and
i
might
add
that
if
he
does
request
a
hearing,
the
hearing
itself
is
de
novo.
nothing
that
went
on
before
is
considered
to
be
bearing
one
way
or
another
in
whether
there
is
a
violation
and
if
he
loses
the
hearing,
i
might
add,
he
has
the
opportunity
to
appeal
within
the
administrative
process
to
the
board
of
mine
operations
appeal,
but
let
us
assume
he
does
not
request
a
hearing
because
that
is
the
situation
in
this
case.
if
he
does
not
request
a
hearing,
then
the
order,
the
proposed
order
of
assessment
becomes
the
final
order
of
the
secretary.
now,
that
sets
forth
the
amount
of
the
fine;
it
sets
forth
the
regulations
violated;
it
sets
forth
the
days
in
which
the
notices
of
violation
were
issued
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
i
might
add
also
that
this
is
not
all.
this
is
not
the
mine
operator’s
only
opportunity
as
to
find
out
what
he
has
been
charged
with
and
why
he
has
been
assessed
a
certain
penalty.
in
fact,
the
old
regulations,
one
of
the
most
normal
occurrences
was
that
conferences
were
held,
informal
conferences,
maybe
as
little
as
simply
picking
up
of
a
telephone
and
calling
the
assessment
officer
and
asking
him
“why
the
penalty
you
assessed
against
me
was
$25
instead
of
$50.”
mr.
randolph
yes.
if
it
please,
i
will
do
it
now.
i
would
like
to
just
finish
up
this
summary.
in
that
effect,
the
gao
report
that
surveyed
the
operations
of
the
assessment
office
pointed
out
that
for
three
assessment
officers,
35%
of
their
time
was
spent
in
informal
conferences.
now,
even
after
all
of
this,
the
secretary
cannot
collect
a
cent
from
the
mine
operators.
he
cannot
collect
anything.
he
cannot
force
the
mine
operator
to
pay.
he
must
go
to
the
district
court
where
the
trial
is
de
novo
on
all
relevant
issues
and,
regarding
issues
of
fact,
the
mine
operators
can
request
a
jury
trial.
i
noticed
that
delta
mining
and
g.
m.
w.,
in
fact,
did
request
a
jury
trial
in
this
case.
what
this
means
is
simply
this
that
after
all
of
these
administrative
proceedings,
regardless
of
what
went
on
during
these
administrative
proceedings,
as
soon
as
the
mine
operator
does
not
pay,
they
are
all
transformed
into
nothing
more
than
a
charge,
an
allegation,
a
complaint.
in
a
civil
case,
the
administrative
proceedings
are
not
facts.
they
are
simply
allegations
to
be
proved
like
any
other
case
in
a
district
court.
now,
the
claim
here
is
that
the
mine
operator
who
never
requested
an
administrative
hearing
can
defend
a
de
novo
trial
and
enforcement
action
on
the
basis
that
the
secretary
did
not
make
adequate
findings
of
fact.
the
relevant
statute,
109
(a)
(3)
scarcely
compelled
such
a
result
on
its
language.
it
is
always
difficult
to
argue
orally
whether
a
statute
is
plain
on
its
face
or
it
is
not
plain.
the
very
fact
that
judges
mackinnon,
chief
justice
bazelon,
judge
mcgowan,
and
incidentally,
i
might
add,
the
gao
itself
in
its
report
thought
that
the
statute
did
not
require
written
findings
of
fact
when
no
hearing
had
been
held
is
at
least
some
evidence
that
reasonable
men
differ
on
whether
the
statute
means
one
thing
or
another.
our
reading
is
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
necessary
as
to
a
violation
and
as
to
a
penalty
only
after
the
mine
operator
has
taken
advantage
of
his
opportunity
for
an
apa
type
hearing.
the
secretary
himself
has
always
read
the
statute
this
way.
there
had
been
a
number
of
statements
in
the
argument
that
said
that
originally
the
secretary
read
the
statute
the
other
way
and
required
findings
of
fact
in
regard
to
every
order.
that
is
not
so.
the
original
regulations
which
were
issued,
and
i
might
add,
saturday,
march
28,
1970
were
enjoined
incidentally
in
a
case
called
radcliff
v.
hickle
(ph)
in
the
western
district
of
virginia
in
a
suit
by
the
mine
operators
so
that
these
regulations
did
not
go
into
effect.
i
do
not
think
a
single
penalty
was
assessed
under
them,
but
these
original
regulations
which
are
contained
in
35
federal
register
5256
said
only
that
the
hearing
examiner
has
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
penalty
which
is
warranted
and
incorporate
in
his
decision
the
violation
of
an
order
that
the
penalty
be
paid.
the
only
time
findings
of
fact
were
required
under
those
regulations
is
after
a
hearing
which
is
precisely
the
point
we
are
making
here.
now,
back
to
the
statutory
language
itself,
i
think
the
reading
that
we
proposed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
certainly
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
--
is
reasonably
within
the
wording
so
that
the
language
can
bear
that
meaning.
whether
it
is
conclusive
or
not
conclusive
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
i
think,
is
really
beside
the
point.
mr.
randolph
i
have
a
couple
of
answers
to
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
the
wrong
question.
the
question
should
have
been
--
when
you
look
at
the
statute
109
(a)
(3)
notice
that
the
apa
is
invoked
right
at
the
bottom,
it
is
the
last
sentence.
the
question
should
have
been
why,
after
requiring
findings
of
fact
in
a
decision
and
a
hearing,
did
congress
invoke
the
apa
at
the
last
part
of
the
section.
the
answer
to
that
if
that
question
had
been
asked
and,
incidentally,
it
was
not
by
the
court,
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
clear.
that
congress
wanted
to
bring
in
to
bear
on
the
hearing
all
of
the
detailed
requirements
about
what
we
mean
by
a
hearing
examiner,
when
the
hearing
has
to
be
held,
notice,
and
so
on.
that
would
be
swept
in
by
a
reference
to
the
apa.
he
had
to
refer
specifically
to
the
apa
to
accomplish
that
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
and
i
do
not
think
this
was
mentioned
in
our
brief,
section
507
of
the
act,
this
act,
the
coal
mine
act,
specifically
says
that
the
apa
is
inapplicable,
this
entire
act,
unless
it
is
expressly
so
provided.
so,
congress
had
to
invoke
the
apa
for
that
reason,
number
one;
and,
number
two,
the
apa
would
not
have
applied
here
in
this
case,
otherwise,
because
of
the
trial
de
novo
in
the
district
court
which
would
make
the
apa
inapplicable.
i
might
add,
the
really
remarkable
thing
about
the
statute
is
that
the
mine
operators
are
even
given
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
that
is
the
remarkable
thing
about
the
statute.
that
cuts
against
the
grain
of
jurisprudence
because
in
trial
de
novo
situations
hearings
are
not
required.
now,
getting
back
to
the
particular
language,
we
think
that
this
language
is
illuminated
by
the
legislative
history
that
bears
on
it.
this
is
not
a
detailed
--
what
i
am
about
to
tell
the
court
is
not
a
detailed
analysis
of
reports
and
a
snippet
of
a
hearing
and
maybe
a
line
from
another
report
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
this
is,
i
think,
probably
the
most
solid
legislative
history
that
one
can
have
because
i
rely
on
the
house
provision
and
what
that
said
and
the
senate
bill
and
what
that
said,
and
what
happen
when
they
were
put
together
in
a
merge
in
conference.
and,
i
think
this
will
explain
why
that
conjunction
is
there.
these
two
provisions,
the
house
bill
and
the
senate
bill,
the
predecessors
of
section
109
(a)
(3),
are
set
out
in
our
brief
on
pages
24-25.
one
thing
is
absolutely
clear
from
both
these
bills
and
that
is
that
no
findings
of
fact
were
required
except
in
regard
to
a
hearing,
after
a
hearing
was
held.
the
senate
bill
could
hardly
be
more
explicit
on
this
point.
the
original
senate
bill
from
which
this
statute
is
derived
said
that
the
mine
operator
--
mr.
randolph
i
am
sorry,
pages
24-25.
mr.
randolph
of
our
brief.
mr.
randolph
yes,
the
other
brief
did
not
go
that
high.
now,
the
senate
bill
which
is
on
page
25
originally
said
that
an
order
assessing
a
civil
penalty
shall
be
issued
by
the
secretary,
etcetera,
etcetera,
only
after
the
mine
operator
has
been
given
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
the
secretary
has
determined
by
decision
incorporating
findings
of
fact
based
on
the
record
of
such
hearing.
now,
that
language
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
only
time
findings
of
fact
were
required
was
when
there
was
a
hearing,
which
is
our
point.
the
house
bill,
i
think,
was
just
as
clear.
he
conference
committee
took
both
of
those
bills,
the
house
bill
and
the
senate
bill,
and
what
they
did
to
that
language
that
i
have
just
quoted
on
page
25
is,
instead
of
saying
“incorporating
findings
of
fact
based
on
the
record
of
such
hearing,”
they
took
out
based
on
the
record
of
such
“hearing”
and
added
instead
“therein.”
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
conference
report
that
they
were
intending
to
change
the
meaning
of
this
provision
by
doing
that,
by
trying
to
streamline
the
language.
we
do
not
think
they
did.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
the
senate
and
house
bills
were
in
agreement
on
this
point,
and
i
think
we
mentioned
this
in
the
brief,
conference
committees
are
appointed
to
resolve
differences
between
the
houses.
they
are
to
compromise.
here,
there
was
no
difference.
the
two
bills
were
the
same.
they
were
put
together.
the
mine
operators
argue
that
something
new
came
out.
if
that
were
true,
then
the
conference
committee
had
exceeded
its
authority
and
a
point
of
order
would
have
been
put
on
the
floor
and
that
would
have
defeated
this
entire
legislation.
we
find
that
incredible
to
believe.
we
think
the
legislative
history
is
perfectly
plain,
and
that
is
why
the
conjunction
is
in
there,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
it
is
derived
from
this
particular
provision
on
page
25.
now,
the
mine
operator’s
only
point
really,
and
i
do
not
think
they
stress
this
in
their
argument
but
since
it
is
in
the
brief
i
will
deal
with
it,
for
requiring
findings
of
fact
in
cases
where
there
is
no
hearing
is
simply
this:
if
the
mine
operators
had
these
findings
of
fact,
they
would
be
more
upped
to
pay
and
that
would
relieve
the
courts
of
some
of
the
burden
of
enforcement
suits.
let
me
respond
to
that.
there
are
three
points
that
i
think
are
against
it.
number
one,
congress
never
considered
it.
congress
never
considered
whether
the
administrative
burden
entailed
by
that
kind
of
a
process
as
outweighed
by
the
alleged
benefits
that
the
mine
operator
cites.
number
two,
the
underlying
assumption
that
the
mine
operators
will
tend
to
pay
more
lacks
any
support
whatever.
there
is
no
evidentiary
support
for
that
and
if
the
idea
is
that
the
mine
operators
need
more
information
because
if
they
only
knew
what
they
were
being
charged
with
and
why
they
were
being
penalized,
they
would
pay,
the
fact
is
they
could
have
gotten
that
information
indeed,
in
many
cases,
did
if
not
by
talking
to
the
mine
inspector,
calling
up
the
hearing
officer,
seeking
an
informal
conference.
they
had
that
opportunity
and
yet,
still,
we
have
under
these
old
regulations
more
than
18,000
violations
that
have
not
been
paid
yet.
the
third
point,
and
i
think
this
is
probably
the
most
significant,
is
as
to
the
burden
on
the
courts
we
think
personally
that
the
burden
might
well
increase
if
you
accept
the
mine
operator’s
arguments
because
what
does
it
mean?
it
means
that
the
mine
operators
are
then
given
one
more
opportunity
to
contest
in
a
de
novo
enforcement
action
to
argue
that
the
whole
action
should
be
dismissed,
not
because
they
did
not
violate
the
act,
not
because
the
penalty
is
too
high,
but
because
the
findings
of
fact
were
not
adequate,
not
sufficient
under
administrative
law.
professor
davidson
(ph),
as
an
administrative
law
treaty,
says
at
section
1601
that
the
amount
of
litigation
involved
where
the
adequacy
of
administrative
findings
is
nothing
short
of
tremendous.
if
that
is
what
this
results
in,
if
a
holding
for
the
mine
operators
results
in
that,
it
means
that
every
enforcement
action
will
be
met
at
the
outset
with
a
contest
over
whether
the
findings
effect
were
detailed
enough
or
sufficient
enough
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
that,
i
think
mr.
blackwell
used
the
argument
of
alice
in
wonderland,
that
is
alice
in
wonderland-like.
why?
because
the
only
importance
of
those
administrative
proceedings
is
merely
that
they
are
charged.
they
are
simply
acclaimed.
they
wash
out
as
soon
as
the
enforcement
action
is
brought,
they
are
irrelevant.
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
i
think
that,
in
light
of
the
system
that
is
now
set
up
that
there
are
administrative
safeguards.
indeed,
there
are
more
than
enough
administrative
safeguards
for
the
mine
operators.
they
have
the
right
to
--
mr.
randolph
i
said
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
the
findings
of
fact
were
adequate
enough,
detailed
enough,
because
the
court
in
an
enforcement
action
cannot
rely
upon
them
anyway.
they
are
irrelevant
to
whether
the
--
and
the
jury
is
the
one
that
determines
the
facts,
and
mr.
blackwell
indeed
requested
a
jury.
so
the
jury
is
not
going
to
consider
whether
the
administrator’s
findings
of
fact
were
sufficient
or
not.
they
are
just
irrelevant
to
that
consideration.
now,
i
think
this
is
where
the
third
circuit
went
wrong
in
the
delta
mining
case.
if
you
read
the
opinion
by
that
court,
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
entire
opinion
--
the
words
“de
novo”
do
not
appear
within
the
entire
opinion.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
court
mistakenly
thought
that
this
was
the
kind
of
case
where
the
administrative
action
is
reviewed
on
the
basis
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
are
two
things
that
i
think
this
court
can
see
the
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
fell
into
in
the
delta
mining
case.
one
of
the
main
reasons
on
page
11-a
of
our
petition,
i
will
read
it
to
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
in
delta
mining
said
“judicial
review
of
a
final
administrative
determination
is
held
as
a
right
and
such
review
is
rendered
practically
impossible
or
at
least
vastly
more
difficult
where
the
agency’s
decision
is
not
accompanied
by
expressed
findings.”
that
goes
precisely
to
the
point
that
i
was
just
discussing.
it
is
not
rendered
more
difficult
because
there
is
no
review
of
the
agency’s
findings.
this
is
a
de
novo
trial.
the
agency’s
findings
are
transformed
merely
into
a
charge
that
has
to
be
proven.
so,
i
think
that
is
wrong.
on
page
12-a,
the
court
said,
finally,
“though
it
might
not
be
beyond
congress’
power
to
provide
for
the
entry
by
the
secretary
of
penalty
assessments
orders
without
findings
of
fact,
such
a
provision
would
run
against
the
grain
of
much
of
our
administrative
jurisprudence.”
i
submit
that
it
is
just
other
way
around.
requiring
findings
of
fact
when
there
has
been
no
administrative
hearing
runs
directly
against
the
grain
of
our
administrative
jurisprudence
because
the
apa
which
is
a
reflection
of
that
tradition
says
specifically
that,
number
one,
hearings
are
not
required.
number
two,
findings
of
fact
are
not
required
when
there
is
an
opportunity
for
de
novo
review
of
all
the
issues
in
a
district
court
proceeding.
that
is
precisely
what
this
statute
provides.
