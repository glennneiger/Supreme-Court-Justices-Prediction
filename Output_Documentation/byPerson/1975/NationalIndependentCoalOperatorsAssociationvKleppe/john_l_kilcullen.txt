mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
these
consolidated
cases
present
a
single
legal
issue
as
to
whether
the
bureau
of
mines
of
the
department
of
interior
in
assessing
civil
penalties
for
alleged
violations
of
the
federal
coal
mine
health
and
safety
act
followed
strictly
the
procedural
requirements
spelled
out
by
congress
in
the
act.
the
act
directs
that
the
operator
of
a
coal
mine
in
which
a
violation
occurs
shall
be
assessed
to
civil
penalty
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
an
amount
not
less
than
$10,000
for
each
violation.
the
penalty
provisions
of
the
statute
are
mandatory,
i.e.,
the
secretary
must
assess
penalty
in
each
instance
where
he
finds
a
violation.
in
this
respect,
the
act
differs
from
other
occupational
safety
acts
such
as
osha
which
give
the
administrative
agency
discretion
to
assess
penalties
where
a
fault
is
found.
here,
the
statute
requires
in
each
case
that
a
penalty
be
assessed
regardless
of
fault.
because
of
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
penalty
provisions
of
this
statute,
congress
wrote
into
the
act
certain
procedural
safeguards
which
must
be
followed
by
the
secretary
in
assessing
these
penalties.
the
act
expressly
provides
that
a
penalty
shall
be
assessed
by
the
secretary
only
after
a
mine
operator
charged
with
the
violation
has
had
an
opportunity
for
a
public
hearing
and
the
secretary
has
determined
by
decision
incorporating
findings
of
fact
that
a
violation
occurred
and
the
amount
of
the
penalty
which
is
warranted.
the
statute
also
requires
that
hearings
be
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
penalty,
the
secretary
must
consider
six
criteria
spelled
out
in
the
statute:
the
operator’s
prior
record
of
violations,
the
size
of
his
business,
whether
he
was
negligent,
the
gravity
of
the
violation,
his
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
compliance,
and
whether
the
penalty
would
affect
his
ability
to
continue
in
business.
these
cases
are
before
the
court
because
the
secretary
has
not
applied
these
procedural
safeguards.
instead,
he
has
adapted
a
summary
type
of
procedure
under
which
he
has
authorized
the
bureau
of
mines
to
issue
a
proposed
order,
a
proposed
assessment,
in
advance
of
any
hearing
or
any
finding
or
determination
that
a
violation
occurred.
unless
the
mine
operator
request
formal
adjudication
within
a
certain
number
of
days
after
he
receives
such
a
proposed
order,
the
order
becomes
final
by
its
terms.
the
bureau
of
mines’
assessment
officer
who
issues
these
assessment
orders
is
not
a
qualified
administrative
law
judge
nor
does
he
have
authority
to
hold
hearings
or
adjudicate
disputed
issues.
on
deposition,
he
admitted
that
he
made
no
effort
to
determine
whether
a
violation
had
in
fact
occurred,
and
he
also
admitted
that
in
fixing
the
amount
of
the
penalty
he
had
simply
followed
a
preset
penalty
schedule
which
gave
no
consideration
to
the
six
statutory
criteria.
in
the
national
independent
coal
operators’
case,
the
district
court
found
that
the
assessment
officer
gave
no
meaningful
consideration
to
the
six
statutory
criteria
for
determining
penalties
and
that
he
made
no
independent
determination
as
to
whether
the
charged
violation
had
occurred.
in
the
delta
mining
group
of
cases,
the
district
courts
refused
enforcement
of
these
penalty
assessment
orders
on
the
same
ground,
that
they
were
not
based
on
a
genuine
determination
as
to
the
occurrence
of
a
violation
or
consideration
of
the
statutory
criteria
for
determining
the
penalty
amount.
now,
the
government
has
argued
that
the
statutory
language
requires
only
that
the
mine
operator
be
given
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
and
if
he
does
not
request
a
hearing
there
is
no
need
for
a
decision
incorporating
findings
of
fact.
in
other
words,
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
act
are
satisfied
simply
by
advising
the
operator
that
he
can
request
a
hearing.
the
balance
of
the
section
which
calls
for
determination,
the
government
says,
becomes
inoperative
once
he
had
been
given
this
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
the
district
courts
in
the
cases
below
rejected
this
argument
and
held
that
in
all
cases,
before
an
assessment
order
can
become
final,
it
must
be
supported
by
a
decision
incorporating
the
secretary’s
findings
of
fact
that
a
violation
did
occur
in
the
amount
of
the
penalty
which
is
warranted,
and
held
that
the
procedures
leading
to
the
orders
sought
to
be
enforced
by
the
secretary
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
simply
follows
the
standard
procedure
for
adjudicating
penalties,
any
penalty,
to
be
asserted
against
the
citizen.
there
must
be
some
adjudicative
process
and
this
is
simply
what
the
congress
provided
here
that
there
must
be
a
determination.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
but
the
statute
says
that
the
secretary
must
apply
these
criteria
in
making
a
determination
and
unless
he
has
done
so,
the
operator’s
failure
to
request
a
hearing
does
not
validate
or
does
not
cure
a
secretary’s
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute.
he
has
to
find
that
there
has
been
a
violation,
and
having
found
that
there
is
a
violation,
he
must
then
decide
what
the
amount
of
the
penalty
must
be
and
in
doing
so,
he
has
to
take
into
account
the
six
criteria.
the
procedure
that
has
been
followed
here
eliminates
that.
it
simply
involves
issuing
a
proposed
order
and
advising
the
operator
that
if
he
does
not
request
a
hearing
a
proposed
order
becomes
final.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes,
sir,
that
initiates
the
hearing
procedure
and
then
the
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
your
question
is
why
did
not
the
operators
request
a
hearing?
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
cannot
answer
that
question
other
than
to
say
that
the
operators
undoubtedly
felt
that
these
orders
were
not
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
procedure,
that
the
orders
were
not
valid
orders.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
in
every
one
of
these
cases
--
your
honor,
in
every
one
of
these
cases
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
operator
protested,
filed
a
protest
with
the
assessment
officer
and
sent
in
material
to
establish
that
the
circumstances
of
the
violation
were
set
to
the
penalty
--
it
sets
should
not
be
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
are
correct
in
saying
it
is
a
lawyer’s
fight.
i
believe
that
the
mine
operator
is
entitled
to
the
due
process
that
is
set
out
on
the
statute,
your
honor,
and
his
failure
to
request
a
hearing
does
not
entitle
the
secretary
to
disregard
the
statute.
he
cannot
avoid
his
responsibility
to
adjudicate.
he
has
got
to
make
a
determination.
he
cannot
assume
that
a
violation
occurred,
which
he
does
--
which
the
assessment
officer
does.
he
cannot
assume
the
existence
of
a
violation.
he
must
find,
under
the
statute,
he
must
find
that
there
was
in
fact
a
violation,
and
if
he
finds
that,
as
i
say,
he
then
has
to
determine
the
amount
that
is
to
be
assessed.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
mitigation,
your
honor?
no,
i
think
they
are
not
given
adequate
notice
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
charge
is.
the
district
court
so
found
in
the
national
independent
case
that
all
they
get
is
a
pro-form
of
printed
form
with
some
blanks
still
there
which
says
“you
have
been
assessed”
or
“we
propose
to
assess
a
penalty
of
so
much
money”
without
any
explanation
of
why
or
how
the
penalty
was
determined.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
the
secretary
originally
set
up
a
procedure
whereby,
in
each
case,
the
matter
would
be
sent
to
the
office
of
hearings
and
appeals,
and
then
the
bureau
of
mines
had
to
file
a
petition
for
an
assessment
within
which
they
would
spell
out
the
circumstances,
all
of
the
factual
background,
and
so
on.
in
that
circumstance,
the
matter
would
then
go
to
an
administrative
law
judge
who
would
take
testimony
and
make
findings
and
then
further
appeal
from
that
to
the
board
of
mine
operations
appeals.
now,
after
this
procedure
was
in
effect
for
a
year,
the
secretary
decided
he
was
going
to
take
a
shortcut
and
he
then
adapted
this
new
summary
procedure
under
which
the
assessment
office
would
send
out
these
proposed
penalties.
the
important
point
i
think
is
that
the
assessment
officer
made
no
adjudication,
no
attempt
to
adjudicate.
he
admitted
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
find
whether
a
violation
had
occurred.
he
simply
took
the
notice
of
violation
that
had
been
issued
by
the
mine
inspector
and
on
the
basis
of
that
he
issued
the
penalties.
now
the
penalties
were
in
large
amounts
in
many
cases,
running
$5,000-$10,000.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
he
found
a
situation
which
he
considered
to
be
a
violation
but
that
does
not
prove
the
existence
of
a
violation.
there
has
to
be
some
actual
proof
in
many
of
these
instances,
and
these
cases
are
now
being
heard
by
administrative
law
judges.
when
the
evidence
is
heard,
it
is
found
that
there
was
not
in
fact
a
violation.
the
mine
inspector
misread
the
situation.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
they
could
go
to
a
hearing,
right.
the
question
is
whether
the
order
which
became
final
without
a
hearing
was
a
valid
order
because
it
was
not
based
upon
a
determination
as
to
the
existence
of
a
violation
or
the
application
of
these
statutory
criteria.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
there
is
not
adjudicative
officer
in
this
procedure,
your
honor.
the
secretary
dispensed
with
an
adjudicative
officer.
all
he
has
is
an
assessment
officer
who
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
why
is
he
not
entitled
to
take
it?
because
it
is
a
unproved
violation
and
it
has
to
be
established
by
adequate
evidence.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
no,
sir,
i
do
not
understand.
i
think
perhaps
i
am
not
getting
across.
the
assessment
officer,
it
is
a
ministerial
act
with
him.
all
he
does
is
just
--
in
fact
his
clerical
staff
just
filled
in
the
blanks
on
these
forms,
these
pre-credit
forms.
he
made
no
effort
to
adjudicate
or
make
any
determination
of
any
of
these
questions.
he
just
sent
out
an
order,
and
he
said
“unless
you
pay
this
order
or
request
a
hearing,
it
becomes
a
final
order
of
the
secretary.”
now
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
secretary
cannot
disregard
the
statute.
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
statutory
requirements
cannot
be
waived
by
the
person
who
is
charged
with
the
violation.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
he
could
pay
the
penalty
and
settle
the
case
and
not
at
that
level
if
he
wished,
but
if
he
did
not
wish
to
pay
this
penalty
he
filed,
in
these
cases,
as
we
have
indicated,
he
filed
a
protest.
he
said
“i
think
this
is
erroneous;
it
is
wrong.”
now,
at
that
stage,
he
should
have
--
if
the
secretary
wanted
to
make
this
penalty
a
final
penalty,
he
should
have
gone
through
the
adjudicative
process.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
we
did,
in
fact,
make
the
constitutional
argument,
there
was
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
no,
the
district
court
held
in
our
favor
in
each
case
and
the
third
circuit
held
in
our
favor
in
the
one
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
they
did
not
consider
the
constitutional
argument.
they
read
the
statute.
they
said
“we
aer
going
to
go
back
and
try
to
find
out
what
the
congress
meant
in
the
statute,”
and
we
feel
they
misread
completely
the
statute.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
it
is
the
question
of
due
process
of
law
i
think
is
a
proper
question
here.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
that
is
a
question.
the
statute
is
ambiguous
on
that
point
and,
in
fact,
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
this
would
come
up
in
a
situation
where
the
secretary
goes
into
the
district
court
for
enforcement
as
he
did
in
the
delta
mining
cases,
and
the
operator
then
says
“i
think
this
order
of
the
secretary
is
invalid.
it
was
improperly
issued,
and
i
want
to
have
a
full
de
novo
trial
on
these
issues.”
now
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
no,
the
government
said
in
the
delta
mining
case,
in
the
pre-trial
conference,
the
government
contended
that
this
de
novo
trial
provision
of
the
statute
does
not
give
the
operator
the
right
to
adjudicate
the
fact
of
the
violation.
in
fact,
in
the
appendix
on
page
--
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
well,
they
did
not
spell
it
out
in
those
forms.
they
said
the
way
that
the
statute
reads,
excuse
me
your
honor,
i
will
just
read
the—
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
have
it
right
here,
i
believe.
it
is
in
the
appendix.
here
it
is
in
the
appendix.
i
am
sorry.
it
is
on
page
6
of
the
government’s
brief,
the
addendum
on
page
6.
it
says
the
court,
that
is
the
district
court,
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
judgment
enforcing
modified
and
enforcing
as
so
modified
or
setting
aside
in
whole
or
in
part
the
order
and
decision
of
the
secretary
or
may
remand
the
proceedings
to
the
secretary
for
such
further
action
as
it
may
direct.
the
court
shall
consider
and
determine,
de
novo,
all
relevant
issues
except
issues
of
fact
which
were
or
could
have
been
litigated
in
review
proceedings
before
a
court
of
appeals,
under
section
106
of
this
act.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
yes,
sir.
well,
i
will
just
finish
up
and
i
point
the
government
argued
in
the
pre-trial
conference
that
these
issues
could
have
been
litigated
in
an
appeal
proceeding
under
section
106
and,
therefore,
the
operator
was
not
entitled
to
a
de
novo
consideration
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
has
it
been
used
up?
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
you
say
my
time
has
been
used
up?
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
thank
you.
mr.
john
l.
kilcullen
i
thought
i
had
reserved
some
time,
apparently
not.
