but
if
he
requests
a
hearing
without
law,
the
procedure
goes
in,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
he
not
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
not
cost
him
anything
to
send
a
note,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
send
a
note
and
say
“we
want
a
hearing.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
like
a
lawyer’s
fight,
he
just
wants
to
try
this
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
lawyer’s
fight;
he
just
wants
to
try
the
statute
out,
when
all
you
have
to
do
was
send
in
one
little
piece
of
paper
saying
“i
request
a
hearing.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
blackwell,
if
you
would
have
had
the
hearing,
how
long
would
have
it
taken?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
a
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
pretty
close.
justice
thurgood
marshall
pretty
close
to
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
long?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
would
it
be
decided?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
meant
to
tell
me
that
if
you
ask
or
a
hearing
you
get
one
within
three
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
never
seen
a
government
agency
doing
that
in
history.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
that
is
what
i
meant;
when
would
it
be
finished?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
same
time
we
have
here.

complained
about
it
into
the
year.
am
i
right?
