justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kilcullen,
isn’t
your
version
of
what
congress
provided
here
rather
elaborate
by
the
standards
of
normal
administrative
law?
if
congress
clearly
provided
it,
certainly
that
is
the
way
it
ought
to
be,
but
if
there
is
ambiguity,
is
there
not
some
question
as
to
whether
this
is
a
rather
unusually
elaborate
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
has
an
opportunity
for
an
adjudication
if
he
wants
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
mine
inspector
did
make
an
effort
to
find
out
whether
a
violation
had
occurred,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
sort
of
a
hearing
was
opened
to
any
of
your
clients
on
request.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it
was
not
based
upon
a
determination
of
the
existence
of
a
violation.
why,
at
that
stage
of
the
administrative
proceeding,
is
not
the
adjudicative
officer
entitled
to
take
the
representations
of
the
mine
safety
inspector?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
call
it
then
that
why
is
the
assessment
officer
then
entitled
to
take
their
finding
of
the
mine
safety
inspector?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
it
has
to
be
proved
twice
then
in
a
course
of
an
administrative
hearing,
first,
at
the
preliminary
stage
and
then,
if
a
hearing
is
requested,
again?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
had
before
us
just
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
serious
question
of
mootness
whether
since
all
you
sought
in
that
action
was
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
these
procedures.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
not
resolve
the
mootness
issue
as
to
the
third
circuit’s
case
though
where
there
you
did
have
an
effort
to
enforce
these
penalties
and
the
government
seeks
to
enforce
them
regardless
of
the
effect
of
these
new
rules?
you
do
not
contend
that
is
moot,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
the
declaratory
judgment
aspect
change
the
mootness
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
deal
with
the
conjunctive
language
in
section
109
(a)
(3)
which
seems
to
cut
against
your
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
be
brought
in
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
is
certainly
not
unknown
to
administrative
law
even
where
you
have
a
trial
de
novo
to
require
some
sort
of
procedural
safeguards
in
the
administrative
proceeding
in
some
sort
of
an
administrative
record.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
not
the
argument
you
were
making
a
minute
ago.
a
minute
ago,
you
were
saying
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
there
are
or
not
because
the
whole
thing
washes
out
when
an
enforcement
action
is
brought.
