mr.
fred
blackwell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there
is
no
consideration
of
health
or
safety
of
the
minors
attaching
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
the
coal
mine
inspector
issues
a
notice
to
obey
the
condition
which
he
considers
unsafe.
that
inspector’s
order
must
be
obeyed
within
the
time
he
allows
for
the
correction,
otherwise,
the
affected
part
of
the
mine
is
closed
down.
so,
there
is
absolutely
no
connection
between
this
case
and
the
safety
actions
which
are
taken
in
the
day-to-day
operations
in
the
mine.
the
penalty
assessment
process
comes
many
months
after
the
condition
has
been
corrected.
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
that
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
give
us
any
due
process
protection
beyond
that
already
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
we
merely
ask
that
the
secretary
be
required
to
honor
the
expressed
penalty
assessment
procedures
that
are
already
there.
we
contend
that
the
penalty
orders
in
these
cases
are
invalid
for
a
number
of
reasons,
the
major
one
of
which
is
that
the
secretary
did
not
comply
with
section
109
(a)
(1)
and
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
the
first
sentence
in
each
of
these
provisions
requires
that
a
violation
must
occur
before
a
penalty
can
be
assessed,
violation
must
occur
before
a
penalty
can
be
assessed.
however,
the
testimony
of
the
secretary’s
assessment
officer,
mr.
everich
turner
(ph),
shows
that
no
proper
finding
of
violation
has
been
made
in
these
cases.
the
turner
testimony,
appendix
page
93,
shows
that
the
assessment
officer
looked
solely
to
the
charge
in
the
inspector’s
unsworn
statement
and
assume
on
the
basis
of
that
that
a
violation
had
occurred.
no
written
finding
of
violation
was
put
in
the
assessment
order
and
in
the
delta
and
g.
m.
w.
cases
no
written
finding
that
a
violation
had
occurred
was
issued
until
long
after
the
final
penalty
orders
had
been
issued.
in
one
instance,
the
finding
of
violation
called
almost
one
year
and
eight
months
after
the
penalty
order
was
issued.
the
findings
were
never
presented
to
the
operators
prior
to
the
secretary’s
enforcement
action
and
we
saw
the
findings
for
the
first
time
when
we
received
the
complaint
as
exhibits
attached
to
the
complaint.
moreover,
these
findings,
when
they
did
come,
although
it
is
an
adjudicatory
function
to
find
such
a
violation,
the
findings
were
made
by
mr.
everich
turner
who
is
the
secretary’s
assessment
officer.
he
is
not
a
hearing
officer.
he
is
not
a
juridical
officer.
this
penalty
process
was
not
under
the
jurisdiction
of
a
juridical
officer
at
any
time
during
the
process.
mr.
fred
blackwell
that
is
the
government
--
the
government’s
position
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
penalty
assessment
procedure
in
a
hearing
and
a
non-hearing
situation,
that
the
statute
simply
does
not
contain
such
a
distinction.
in
fact,
when
the
secretary
first
implemented
the
coal
act
in
1970
his
construction
of
the
statute
was
the
same
as
our
construction
here
today.
the
penalty
assessment
function
was
placed
under
the
jurisdiction
of
a
hearing
officer
from
the
very
beginning.
if
he
had
maintained
that
procedure
which
was
in
conformity
with
the
statute,
we
would
not
have
this
problem
today.
now,
the
fact
that
the
hearing
has
not
been
held
cannot,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
justify
a
government
agency
dispensing
a
sanction
a
monetary
penalty
issuing
the
order
“you
pay
this,”
and
then
months
later
say
“by
the
way,
you
were
guilty
of
something.
you
were
guilty
of
a
violation
of
a
standard.”
mr.
fred
blackwell
the
hearing
in
these
cases
could
have
taken,
well,
the
estimate
--
pardon?
mr.
fred
blackwell
no,
not
a
year,
sir.
mr.
fred
blackwell
pardon?
mr.
fred
blackwell
to
a
year?
mr.
fred
blackwell
the
hearing
in
the
delta
and
g.
m.
w.
--
no,
i
cannot
agree
with
that
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
blackwell
three
to
five
or
seven
days
i
would
say,
at
the
outside.
mr.
fred
blackwell
when
would
it
have
been
decided?
well,
if
the
hearing
examiner
is
not
too
--
mr.
fred
blackwell
i
thought--
excuse
me.
mr.
fred
blackwell
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
asked
how
long
the
hearing
would
take
if
it
were
held.
mr.
fred
blackwell
well,
the
administrative
hearing,
if
it
had
been
asked,
could
have
been
concluded
i
say
within
a
year
after
these
assessments.
mr.
fred
blackwell
no,
i
am
not
complaining
about
a
year.
i
am
pointing
out
that
one
of
the
findings
of
violations
of
a
standard
in
a
mine,
on
which
the
penalties
were
based,
was
not
made
until
a
year
and
eight
months
after
the
penalty
assessment
was
issued.
verdict
first,
trial
afterwards,
alice
in
wonderland,
i
just
cannot
square
this
with
american
jurisprudence
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
mr.
fred
blackwell
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
a
grave
error
to
inject
the
traffic
ticket
violation
into
this
case.
number
one,
there
are
no
$10,000-traffic
tickets
in
this
country
and
these
penalties
can
be
up
to
$10,000,
but
more
basically
all
of
these
traffic
ticket
procedures
are
established
under
a
city
ordinance,
under
a
state
code,
and
i
believe
i
have
seen
maybe
some
by
court
order.
those
procedures
then,
how
they
work,
must
be
measured
by
the
originating
authority
in
the
ordinance.
here,
we
have
a
different
set
of
procedures
with
its
own
source
of
statutory
authority.
we
must
measure
these
procedures
by
its
statutory
source
and
the
traffic
ticket
by
its
statutory
source.
mr.
fred
blackwell
well,
i
see
your
interest
in
that
area,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
this
additional
very
important
distinction
in
my
mind.
number
one,
the
traffic
regulations
and
all
of
that
attached
to
a
conditional
privilege,
in
the
first
place,
a
license
to
drive
a
car.
the
state
issues
this
and
you
agree
to
abide
by
all
of
these.
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
license
to
go
into
the
mining
business.
and,
number
two,
from
the
very
first
instance,
in
which
the
auto-driver
receives
that
ticket
in
his
hand,
he
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
he
is
summoned
to
a
hearing.
he
is
told
that
he
can
forfeit
collateral
and
not
appear
before
that,
but
he
is
before
a
judicial
forum
from
the
very
moment
that
he
receives
that
ticket,
and
those
procedures
are
established
by
their
own
source
of
statutory
authority.
here,
we
have
a
different
statutory
authority
and
--
mr.
fred
blackwell
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
blackwell
in
this
case,
those
new
regulations
are
not
involved
at
all,
your
honor.
it
is
only
the
former
regulations.
mr.
fred
blackwell
they
have
been
replaced
and
i
have
had
no
reason
to
study
those
to
make
even
a
speculative
judgment
on
their
validity
or
non-validity.
mr.
fred
blackwell
that
is
right.
it
was
the
method
in
which
the
past
assessments
were
issued
under
the
former
regulation.
all
i
know
is
i
am
just
not
familiar
with
what
is
going
on
under
the
new
regulations
except
to
have
information
that
the
non-hearing
situations
under
the
new
regulations,
are
causing
no
practical
problems
there.
the
hearing
examiners
are
able
to
deal
with
these
expeditiously
and
there
is
no
fact
back
up
there.
mr.
fred
blackwell
well,
i
think
you
have
a
serious
question
of
mootness
in
any
event
and
the
only
thing
that
might
save
it
is
the
government’s
2,000
cases
distributed
to
the
district
attorneys
all
over
the
country
that
they
say
they
want
to
enforce.
mr.
fred
blackwell
no,
i
say
that
is
what
prevents,
the
2,000
cases
prevent
the
mootness.
mr.
fred
blackwell
i
may
just
include,
gentlemen,
the
third
circuit
had
all
of
these
arguments
before
this,
as
well
as
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
may
have
rendered
its
decision.
