the

and
the
consolidated

the

mr.

mr.
kilcullen,
if
you
are
reading
from
the
record,
where
we
will
find
it.?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
kilcullen,
i
think
you
are
getting
into
mr.
blackwell’s
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
blackwell.
chief
justice

e.
burger
but
was
that
not
in
part
because
it
is
the
government’s
position
that
there
was
no
occasion
absent
a
request
for
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
compare
this,
mr.
blackwell,
with
the
traffic
violation
where
the
traffic
violation
is
asserted
in
the
notice
and
where
you
can
get
a
trial
if
you
want,
if
you
do
not
ask
for
a
trial
the
penalty
is
automatic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
some
situations,
traffic
citation
or
driving
under
the
influence
of
liquor
might
have,
if
not
a
$10,000-impact,
a
very
large
impact
but
does
not
that
same
procedure
prevail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
blackwell.
