mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
brother
neal
says
that
the
central
issue
here
is
whether
a
school
system
that
has
been
in
compliance
with
the
decree
for
some
considerable
period
of
time
may
be
released
from
that
decree
eventually
and
allowed
to
try
other
plans.
were
that,
i
think
the
only
issue
here,
there
would
be
no
disagreement
between
us.
petitioner’s
argument
actually
derives
such
power
that
it
has
from
the
argument
of
questions
that
are
not
before
the
court.
they
do
it
in
two
ways.
one
is
by
arguing
about
what
the
district
court
said
and
did,
rather
than
where
the
court
of
appeals
decision
placed
the
case.
and
secondly,
by
arguing
about
events
that
had
occurred
since
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
judgment
and
those
are
not
before
the
court
either.
what
is
before
the
court
we
suggest
is
a
rather
narrow
case.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
required
as
a
matter
of
law
and
upon
the
facts
as
they
stood
in
1974,
not
upon
the
facts
as
they
stand
today,
to
order
the
district
court
to
relieve
petitioners
from
judicial
supervision
altogether
or
in
the
alternative
to
let
them
put
into
plan
for
voluntary
desegregation.
the
short
answer
i
believe
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
might
perhaps
have
done
so,
but
it
certainly
was
not
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
do
so.
what
it
did
do
was
clerical
miss
that
we
think
under
the
law
as
it
now
stands.
they
were
in
the
pasadena
system
acts
of
de
jure
segregation
by
the
school
system.
in
response,
the
district
court
entered
the
order
under
discussion
here.
that
decree
was
not
appealed
when
it
was
entered
in
1970,
but
the
argument
is
now
made
that
it
was
subsequently
shown
to
be
illegal
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
swann
case
and
should
have
therefore
been
terminated
in
1974.
we
think
we
can
show
that
the
swann
decision
does
not
make
the
decree
illegal.
the
swann
case
says
that
no
particular
decree
of
racial
mix
or
balance
is
a
matter
of
substantive
constitutional
right
and
we
agree
with
that.
nobody
in
this
case
claims
that
it
is.
swann
did
not
say,
however,
that
an
equitable
decree
designed
to
produce
a
unitary
school
system
could
never
under
any
circumstances
start
as
a
matter
of
remedy
from
a
particular
degree
of
racial
mixing.
as
a
starting
point,
such
a
decree
is
unexceptionable
under
existing
law.
though
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
when
i
quoted
from
the
swann
opinion,
i
was
saying
what
that
opinion
says
on
pages
24
and
25.
the
district
court
there
had
imposed
a
numerical
equitable
remedy,
percentage
of
the
races.
this
court
said
that
a
numerical
mixing
of
the
races
was
not
a
substantive
constitutional
right,
but
in
an
equitable
decree
it
was
a
satisfactory
starting
place.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
did
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it
is
inconsistent
with
swann.
i
think
it
was
an
invalid
order
to
that
extent,
but
i
think
it
was
an
order
that
the
petitioners
here
were
required
to
obey
unless
they
got
it
modified
and
let
me
straighten
one
thing
out
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
what
i
would
do
mr.
justice
powell,
were
i
the
member
of
the
school
board,
is
going
to
the
district
court
now
and
say
we
have
done
one
more
reassignment
just
as
chief
justice
chambers’
opinion
said
which
i
think
is
the
opinion
that
represents
the
consensus
or
the
only
majority
that
could
have
been
formed
on
that
court.
we
have
done
one
more
reassignment.
we
now
ought
to
be
released
from
the
decree
and
it
is
our
position.
it
is
the
position
of
united
states
that
that
is
probably
true
if
there
are
no
more
serious
violations.
if
there
is
no
lingering
effect
of
the
de
jure
segregation
as
proven
to
exist,
they
should
be
released
from
the
decree.
but
in
this
case,
we
are
discussing
the
1974
situation
and
in
1974,
these
petitioners
when
they
came
in
made
no
effort
to
deal
with
any
lingering
effects,
not
even
discussed
them
schools
citing
capacity
decisions
and
moreover,
i
should
say
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
i
think
they
were
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not.
i
think
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
modify
that
district
court
order
considerably
and
i
think
i
have
done
everything
that
the
petitioners
have
a
right
to
complain
about.
let
me
make
this
point
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
these
petitioners
were
in
violation
of
that
decree.
phil
neal
said
yesterday
that
nobody
supposed
that
this
decree
required
annual
redistricting.
the
united
states
did
not
suppose
that,
but
it
is
clear
that
besides
the
judge,
the
one
other
party
to
this
case
that
understood
that
was
this
school
board
because
if
you
look
at
their
notice
of
motion
to
modify
the
decree
on
page
233
of
the
appendix,
they
come
in
and
seek
modification
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
having
trouble
complying
by
annual
redistricting.
that
is
under
(1)
and
if
you
look
at
the
affidavit
on
234,
a
raymond
cortines
who
was
a
superintendent
of
the
schools
at
235
and
236,
he
says,
demographic
changes
are
making
it
difficult
for
them
to
keep
up,
to
keep
complying.
if
you
look
at
that
affidavit
of
henry
marquezque
(ph)
on
237
who
was
then
the
president
of
the
pasadena
city
board
of
education,
he
says
that,
it
has
become
practical
impossibility
to
continue
to
comply
with
the
portion
that
judgment
of
this
court
which
required
that
there
be
no
school
district
having
majority
of
any
minority.
the
school
board
understood
that
they
were
under
an
annual
obligation.
that
obligation
i
believe
to
be
invalid,
but
they
had
not
been
changed
and
they
were
violating
it.
they
knew
they
were
violating
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
they
were
not
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
so
modified
it
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
said
one
more
time,
you
have
been
--
i
think
that
is
justified
for
this.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
it
is
not
because
of
demographic
change
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
the
problem
here
is
that
they
were
out
of
compliance
which
indicated
an
attitude
i
think
towards
this
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
allowed
to
take
into
effect.
furthermore
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
first
year.
the
first
time
they
did
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
because
mr.
justice
white,
they
were
under
an
order
which
they
could
have
gotten
rid
of
by
appealing,
but
they
did
not
appeal.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
like
united
mine
workers
case
or
like
any
of
those
cases
which
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
they
got
it
modified
now,
that
is
quite
correct,
but
they
were
under
an
obligation
to
obey
it
as
long
as
it
stood
in
effect.
and
furthermore,
the
other
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
kinds
of
de
jure
violation
shown
in
1970
by
the
kinds
that
have
lingering
effect:
school
citing
school
capacity
decisions,
the
racial
identifiability
of
schools,
they
did
not
even
address
those
problems
in
their
motion
for
modification
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
quite
right
in
saying,
we
want
to
see
those
things
addressed
before
we
say
drop
the
order
altogether.
i
think
now
that
they
--
we
are
told
here
that
they
have
complied
since
1974
and
they
have
done
it
again.
that
is
all
the
court
of
appeals
requires
them.
i
think
if
they
go
back
at
this
time,
they
probably
be
entitled
to
removal
of
the
order.
but
in
1974,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
tell
them
that
the
district
court
order
has
to
be
lifted
in
its
entirety.
that
is
our
entire
position,
a
very
narrow
position.
now,
a
good
deal
of
what
is
happening
here
i
think
is
really
an
objection
to
a
heavy
busing
order
and
that
is
not
really
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
united
states
thinks
it
is
an
inappropriate
case.
the
proper
scope
of
initial
remedies
in
cases
such
as
this
ought
to
be
reexamined.
it
is
our
position
of
proper
function
of
a
remedy
in
this
area
is
like
it
is
in
any
other
area.
it
is
an
attempt
to
put
matters
where
they
would
have
been
if
the
violation
had
never
occurred.
now,
if
that
is
true,
if
we
rethink
the
problem
and
it
comes
out
that
way,
then
it
is
properly
true
that
large
scale
busing
orders
indefinitely
continued
designed
to
produce
a
racial
mix
such
as
this
one
are
probably
beyond
the
proper
scope
with
equitable
remedy.
but
i
do
not
think
this
is
the
case
to
re-examine,
although
that
is
part
of
underlying
pressure
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
i
am
saying
something
additional.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
scope
of
an
order,
the
size
of
swann
scope
perhaps
ought
to
be
rethought
on
the
theory
that
it
did
much
more
than
put
matters
where
they
would
have
been
had
there
been
no
de
jure
violation.
i
am
just
saying
that
was
not
litigated
in
the
distinct
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
i
think
we
should
remove
that
element
of
this
case
from
our
minds
for
that
reason,
this
is
not
the
appropriate
case
to
address
that
problem.
now,
as
i
say,
we
have
been
arguing
about
what
the
district
court
said,
if
what
the
district
court
said
was
still
in
this
case,
we
would
concede
that
petitioners
have
a
lot
of
room
for
well-founded
complaint.
it
is
not
in
this
case.
where
the
court
of
appeals
left
the
case
as
what
we
are
discussing
and
i
will
not
claim
that
there
is
sparkling
clarity
there
either,
but
the
upshot
of
those
opinions
is
it
is
the
only
position
which
can
gain
a
majority
as
judge
chambers
position
and
we
ask
this
court
to
interpret
that
court
of
appeals'
position
as
we
do
and
sustain
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
those
grounds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
there
has
been
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
think
that
means
that
they
have
complied
with
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
reads
the
order
and
i
think
they
are
entitled
under
judge
chambers'
reading
of
the
order
to
go
back
now
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
right.
i
think
they
now
have
the
case
which
the,
they
are
now
in
position
to
go
in
and
say,
the
court
should
stop
active
supervision
of
the
school
system
,
but
we
are
discussing
1974
and
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
well,
1970
is
not
even
up
here
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
only
1974.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
only
in
a
matter
of
the
way
the
law
was
read
in
the
future
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
they
might.
i
think
of
the
judicious
supervision
is
lifted.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
if
they
win
this
case
in
the
sense
that
they
are
told
they
are
out
from
under
judicial
supervision
or
if
they
go
back
to
the
district
court
as
we
think
they
should
and
get
judicious
provision
lifted,
they
are
free
to
return
to
a
(voice
overlap)
policy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
pardon
me.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not
mr.
justice
white.
the
problem
is
that
is
why
we
oppose
certiorari
in
this
case,
that
is
why
we
have
been
saying
this
is
a
very
narrow
case
and
indeed
that
is
why
we
are
standing
here
saying
that
the
real
importance
of
this
case
is
a
question
of
law.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct,
but
the
question
is
whether
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
on
the
facts
existing
as
of
1974
was
within
its
power.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
do
they
have
to
go
in
or
they
have
--
i
assume
if
it
turns
out
they
have
been
in
violation
of
a
valid
part
of
the
decree
again,
they
might
not
get
off
from
under,
but
i
am
assuming
that
they
are
acting
responsibly
under
the
decree
as
they
say
they
are.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
difficulty.
we
keep
discussing
what
the
district
court
said
which
is
no
longer
in
the
case.
we
keep
discussing
what
they
have
done
since
1974
which
is
not
in
this
case.
that
is
why
i
say
this
is
a
narrow
case
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
required
completely
to
remove
these
petitioners
from
judicial
supervision.
and
that
indeed
is
our
entire
case
and
it
is
for
those
reasons
that
we
ask
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
no,
not
a
bit
mr.
justice
powell.
we
merely
said
that
under
existing
law
which
we
have
prepared
to
ask
to
be
reexamined
in
the
appropriate
case,
but
under
existing
law,
under
swann,
it
is
appropriate
if
other
factors
do
not
make
it
too
costly,
too
time
consuming,
too
disruptive
to
take
a
school
district
of
this
size
and
start
with
a
percentage
figure,
as
a
starting
place,
but
you
cannot
keep
it
up.
now,
in
this
case
i
should
stress
that
the
no
majority
of
any
minority
is
a
much
more
flexible
rule
because
there
are
two
minorities
here
it
gives
the
school
board
much
more
room
to
maneuver
than
a
decree
like
swann
did.
so
if
the
swann
decree
was
always
a
stating
place,
this
one
clearly
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
am
not
sure
minority
is
the
term
of
art
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
the
judge
--
there
are
people
who
will
use
minority
as
a
term
of
art
meaning
particular
identified
groups.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
