we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
pasadena
city
board
against
spangler.
mr.
neal
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
use
the
term
racial
balance
mr.
neil,
in
this
context
precisely
what
do
you
embrace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
entire
district?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
was
that
part
of
his
original
order?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
regard
that
as
having
been
modified
by
the
majority,
minority
standard
that
you
refer
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
being
incompatible
with
the
standard
done
by
this
court
in
the
swann
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
racial
balance
is
now
a
constitutional
requirement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
that
swann
in
its
memo
said
that
an
inquiry
under
what
was
the
existing
balance
was
the
starting
point
of
the
inquiry?
i
had
no
inference
that
that
could
be
the
end?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
take
a
census
first
to
know
whether
there
was
any
problem
at
all,
but
once
have
taken
that
census,
perhaps
we
can
address
that
the
first
thing
in
the
morning.[court
adjourned]
chief
justice

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
say
it
is
much
more
of
the
swann
case.
did
we
not
say
that
if
we
read
the
order
of
the
district
judge
as
requiring
any
particular
racial
balance
we
would
disapprove
then
reverse,
but
then
we
went
on
to
read
his
orders
otherwise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
fact
the
results,
that
is
not
in
any
record
before
us
now?

your
time
is
up
mr.
