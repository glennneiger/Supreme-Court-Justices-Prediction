mr.
fred
okrand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
regret
that
i
had
to
take
issue
with
my
colleague
respondent.
the
plaintiff’s
respondent
do
not
view
the
1970
decree
as
being
void,
the
portion
of
the
decree
that
says
the
school
board
at
that
time
and
until
further
relieve
shall
have
no
majority
of
a
minority
in
any
school
of
the
district.
i
read
swann
quite
differently.
i
read
swann
to
allow
just
that
and
that
until
the
school
board
has
shown
that
it
is
a
unitary
school,
a
unitary
district,
it
cannot
be
allowed
to
be
relieved
from
that
requirement.
now,
just
one
assign,
the
judgment
of
the
court
did
not
require
that
there
be
any
particular
racial
in
any
particular
school.
it
even
allowed
your
honor
that
there
will
be
all
white
schools.
it
was
the
school
board
which
decided
that
they
would
not
have
any
all
white
schools.
with
mr.
neal
eliminating
from
the
case,
any
question
i
thought,
i
thought
he
did
as
to
the
validity
of
the
1970
decree,
with
him
eliminating
from
the
case,
the
question
of
any
possible
busing
problem
in
the
case,
i
view
the
case
when
i
left
here
last
night
as
involving
only
one
question
and
that
is
as
to
whether
the
trial
court
abused
its
discretion
in
not
relieving
the
school
board
completely
from
judicial
control
and
alternatively
for
not
allowing
it
to
go
forward
with
this
alternative
plan.
i
think
that
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
and
the
district
court
not
only
did
not
abused
its
discretion
in
not
relieving
the
board
from
judicial
control,
but
with
due
respect
have
it
relieved
the
board
from
judicial
control,
that
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion.
let
me
in
a
few
minutes
if
i
may
point
out
to
the
court
some
of
the
things
that
were
before
the
trial
court
at
the
time
it
was
asked
to
relieve
the
board
of
a
judicial
control.
incidentally,
i
also,
before
i
do
that,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
board
did
not
ever,
ever
ask
the
court
to
relieve
it
of
the
no
majority
of
the
no
minority
requirement,
ever
did
they
do
that.
they
came
into
court
and
they
asked
to
be
relieved
entirely
of
judicial
control
or
if
not
then
to
be
allowed
to
put
in
that
alternative
plan
and
neither
one
would
be
proper
as
i
view
the
case
as
this
court
has
decided.
let
me
review
for
a
moment
what
the
court
had
to
consider.
also,
although
nominally,
the
school
board
is
here
as
a
petitioner,
this
really
is
a
case
involving
human
beings
who
are
charged
with
the
duty
of
running
that
school
system
and
its
human
beings
that
that
judge
had
to
look
at
and
decide
whether
he
would
permit
them
to
go
free
at
that
time
in
1974.
before
the
court
at
that
time
were
these
facts.
the
ink
was
not
even
dry
on
the
1970
judgment
of
the
court
when
certain
persons,
including
the
architect
of
the
so-called
alternative
plan
started
a
movement
to
recall
the
three
members
of
the
board
who
had
the
temerity
of
not
appealing
the
court’s
judgment
and
who
decided
to
go
forward
with
their
efforts
to
desegregate
the
school
district.
these
are
three
members
who
had
just
been
found
guilty
of
segregating
the
school
system
and
their
slogan
in
that
recall
campaign
was
return
to
neighborhood
schools.
now,
return
to
neighborhood’s
schools
--
mr.
fred
okrand
nothing
illegal
at
all
your
honor.
it
is
the
genius
of
our
american
system
that
they
do
that,
but
they
have
to
be
held
responsible
for
what
they
say
and
the
reason
that
they
say
it.
when
the
re-callers
have
returned
to
neighborhood
schools,
this
was
five
months,
five
months
before
the
pasadena
plan
was
even
to
go
into
effect.
what
were
they
to
return
to?
what
they
were
saying
was
remain
where
you
were
and
what
they
were
doing
at
that
time
was
operating
segregated
schools.
return
to
neighborhood
schools
meant
remain
in
segregated
schools.
next,
when
the
architect
of
the
plan
was
elected
to
the
board
the
following
year,
the
recall
having
failed
very
soon
thereafter,
he
presented
a
so
called
alternative
plan
to
the
board
and
what
was
the
cardinal
principle
of
that
alternative
plan?
get
all
black
schools,
the
black
children
were
to
be
encouraged
to
stay
in
the
black
ghetto.
oh!
yes,
there
will
be
some
encouragement
for
them
to
go
out
of
the
black
ghetto,
if
they
so
wanted,
if
they
asked
to
go
out,
but
the
thrust
was
to
keep
them
in
the
black
community
even
to
have
their
own
separate
school,
sub-school
district.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
do
not
know
that
the
school
population
is
about
25
to
28,000.
it
is
a
small
school
district.
the
whole
area
is
less
than
about
half
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
whole
district
from
one
side
to
the
other
is
about
6
miles.
mr.
fred
okrand
yes,
yes,
there
is
indeed,
the
northwest
portion
of
it.
let
me
go
on
if
i
may.
the
next
year,
there
was
an
effort
talking
about
white
flight
which
the
petitioners
have
talked
about.
there
was
an
effort
for
a
whole
segment
of
the
pasadena
school
system
to
flee
from
the
school
district.
they
asked
to
be
relieved
to
join
another
school
district
adjacent
to
it
which
was
all
white
and
while
the
petitioners
talk
about
being
concerned
with
white
flight,
the
architect
of
the
alternative
plan
voted
to
allow
them
to
get
out
to
further
white
flight.
that
was
before
the
board
below.
another
plan
was
presented
by
the
architect
the
following
year.
this
time
he
omitted
the
ghetto
black
school.
after
the
three
--
and
then
that
same
year,
the
three
new
members
subsequently
were
elected
and
became
the
majority
of
the
board
ran
on
the
same
platform
that
had
been
the
re-callers
platform,
this
time
return
the
neighborhood
schools.
i
will
live
out
the
majority
of
stuff
for
busing.
during
that
campaign,
one
of
the
members
who
was
running
for
election,
publicly
announced
that
two
of
his
two
school
children
have
been
taken
out
of
the
pasadena
school
district
out
of
the
public
school
because
of
the
school
to
which
they
have
been
assigned,
thus
demonstrating
his
feeling
about
it.
and
i
agree
with
the
court
for
the
first
circuit
in
the
morgan
versus
corrigan
(ph)
case
in
which
the
court
said
white
flight
is
an
expression
of
opposition
by
individuals
in
the
community
to
desegregation
of
the
school
system.
that
was
before
the
trial
court.
virtually
the
very
first
act
that
was
done
by
this
new
school
board
when
they
took
control
was
to
violate
the
pasadena
plan.
this
court
has
said
that
the
assignment
of
administrators
and
faculty
is
one
of
the
most
important
part
of
whether
or
not
a
school
system
is
segregated
or
desegregated
and
what
do
these
school
board
members
do?
they
immediately
in
violation
of
the
pasadena
plan
which
was
very
carefully
designed
by
the
former
school
board
members
to
make
sure
that
there
would
not
be
discrimination
in
administrative
appointment.
they
appointed
five
top
administrators
in
complete
violation
of
the
plan
which
is
not
the
main
thing.
they
appointed
them
without
even
trying
to
get
the
minority
candidates
that
the
pasadena
plan
and
what
this
court’s
decision
envisage
i
think
and
predictably
those
five
top
appointees
were
caucasians
not
minority.
further
conduct
of
these
board
members
whereas
formally
there
had
been
a
black
task
force
and
a
mexican-american
task
force
designed
to
try
to
look
into
the
needs
of
the
black
and
mexican-american
community,
as
soon
as
this
new
school
board
took
control
there
was
no
longer
any
black
or
mexican-american
task
force.
in
their
conduct
among
themselves,
the
school
board
members
allotted
spheres
of
influence
to
the
four
white
members
of
the
school
board,
none
to
the
black
member
of
the
school
board,
none
and
all
the
time,
they
were
in
violation
of
the
no
majority
of
the
no
minority
clause
and
finally
they
presented
to
the
court,
the
alternative
plan.
now,
i
submit
your
honors
that
when
the
trial
court
was
faced
with
that
kind
of
recalcitrance,
it
had
no
alternative,
but
first
to
deny
the
thought
of
allowing
these
school
board
members
to
go
free
and
go
their
own
way
and
go
back
to
segregated
schools,
go
back
to
black
schools
and
white
schools
and
also
to
deny
the
alternative
plan.
let
me
for
a
moment
if
i
may
if
i
have
time,
go
over
a
few
of
the
things
that
mr.
neal
said
yesterday.
i
have
also
mentioned,
i
think
that
in
our
judgment,
the
board
had
not
been
in
compliance
at
all.
mr.
neal
suggested
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
simply
had
to
do
with
school
assignment.
it
did
not.
it
had
to
do
with
desegregating
the
public
school
system
in
pasadena
which
had
been
segregated
system
for
years
and
it
ordered
desegregation
of
all
features
of
the
pasadena
system,
including
the
administrators
and
the
faculty.
mr.
neal
suggests
there
was
no
resistance
to
the
pasadena
plan.
i
do
not
know
what
resistance
is.
you
do
not
have
to
break
windows.
you
do
not
have
to
turn
over
buses
to
show
resistance.
there
was
resistance
with
the
vengeance
and
perhaps
that
is
the
tragedy
of
pasadena.
have
they
not
done
that,
we
would
not
be
here
at
all
and
they
would
very
well,
perhaps
be
entitled
to
be
relieved
of
court
supervision.
by
no
means
have
they
met
the
standard
of
the
fifth
circuit.
they
have
not
been
in
compliance,
not
even
once.
that
the
school
board
still
needs
supervision
of
the
court
to
make
sure
that
they
do
not
run
amok.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
think
it
is
a
guideline
of
some
type
to
the
trial
court.
it
may
have
eliminated
--
mr.
fred
okrand
i
think
the
court
should
not
do
that.
i
think
the
court
should
properly
--
mr.
fred
okrand
i
do
not
think
the
court
--
i
think
judge
chambers
said
that,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
effect.
mr.
fred
okrand
i
do
on
know.
the
dissent
would
not
agree.
the
dissent
said,
send
it
back
and
find
out
if
they
are
still
remnants
of
de
jure
segregation.
that
is
what
the
dissent
said
and
i
think
there
are
remnants
of
the
of
de
jure
segregation.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
we
always
have
arguments
in
the
district
court
your
honor.
[laughter]
you
should
see.
[laughter]
mr.
neal
suggested
that
the
contempt
citation
which
is
still
pending
on
appeal
was
solely
because
the
school
board
did
not
vacate
the
appointments.
that
is
not
it
at
all.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
at
384
f.
supp.
we
mentioned
it
in
our
brief.
they
were
found
in
contempt
because
they
violated
their
own
pasadena
plan
by
appointing
five
caucasian
administrators
without
trying
to
find
any
minority
administrators
and
they
were
plenty
of
qualified
ones
as
the
court’s
1970
opinion
shows.
mr.
neal
suggested
that
there
was
no
substantial
reason
offered
for
not
allowing
the
relief,
the
alternative
plan.
they
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
alternative
plan
was
better
than
the
pasadena
plan
and
there
is
not
a
shred
of
proof
in
it
at
all.
indeed,
the
record
is
very
clear
and
the
trial
court
just
could
not
have
decided
in
any
other
way
that
had
the
alternative
plan
going
into
effect,
say
next
september,
those
schools
would
immediately
be
black
and
white
schools,
quite
in
violation
of
this
court’s
green
decision
that
says
it
should
only
be
schools
and
not
black
schools
and
not
white
schools.
going
outside
the
record,
i
know
we
are
in
the
supreme
court
and
that
perhaps
permissible
sometimes.
mr.
neal
talked
about
the
audubon
school.
one
of
the
difficulties
in
going
and
outside
the
record
as
you
are
not
able
to
give
the
complete
picture,
mr.
neal
did
not
mention
that
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
of
the
moving
parties
at
the
mckinley
school,
another
school
will
not
be
allowed
to
be
established
as
a
fundamental
school.
he
allowed
that
school
to
be
established
as
a
fundamental
school
because
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
segregation
or
desegregation
of
the
pasadena
schools.
the
reason
they
did
not
allow
the
fundamental
school
at
audubon
was
because
it
was
a
segregating
act
on
the
part
of
the
board.
what
it
did
was
it
put
the
burden
on
the
blacks
who
under
the
pasadena
plan
were
supposed
to,
ideally
to
be
able
to
walk
to
their
own
elementary
school
for
half
the
time
and
ride
if
they
so
chose
the
other
half
the
time,
but
not
this
fundamental
school.
what
that
required
was
at
that
these
blacks
who
were
going
to
that
school
ride
the
bus
the
whole
seven
years
of
the
their
schooling.
and
that
that
is
why
the
trial
court
said
no
i
am
not
going
to
allow
this.
you
got
to
make
that
burden
equal.
then
you
can
have
the
fundamental
school
and
he
said,
“do
no
worry,
go
ahead
and
do
it”
in
mckinley.
mr.
fred
okrand
well,
i
think
i
am
just
about
to
be
at
the
bottom.
i
think
i
really
am.
the
red
light
is
very
dis-concerning
i
must
say.[laugher]
mr.
fred
okrand
oh!
i
am
going
to
just
say
one
more
thing.
talking
again
about
audubon,
the
court
asked
the
superintendent
whether
or
not
he
had
ever
recommended
to
the
board
that
they
come
in
and
ask
for
relief
from
the
no
majority
of
no
minority,
the
superintendent
answered
yes
he
had.
i
think
it
was
three
times
to
the
former
president
of
board
orally
and
once
to
the
present
board
in
writing
and
the
board
still
had
not
gone
in
to
ask
for
that
relief.
having
all
those
things
in
mind,
may
it
please
the
court
there
is
nothing
left
for
this
court
to
do,
it
seems
to
me,
but
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
