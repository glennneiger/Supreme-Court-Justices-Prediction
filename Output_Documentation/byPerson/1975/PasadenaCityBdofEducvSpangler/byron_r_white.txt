justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
point
that
is
that
the
blacks
became
a
majority
in
the
school
district,
the
majority
of
the
students
in
the
public
schools
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
point
they
are
i
suppose
the
condition
would
be
impossible?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
so,
even
it
was
very,
very
difficult
or
impossible
now,
it
might
be
that
the
most
relief
you
could
ask
would
be
for
that
particular
part
of
the
decree
to
be
modified?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
go
much
further
than
that.
do
you
think
the
decree
should
be
lifted
entirely?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
they
said
it
had
to
be
one
more
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
because
of
demographic
change,
is
it
valid
that
it
will
not
be
invalid
for
one
more
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
they
ever
in
compliance?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
make
a
change
in
that
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
it
is
an
invalid
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
what
is
supposed
would
happen
if
the
other
side
won
this
case?
if
the
reassignment
is
already
been
taken
place,
would
it
come
out
any
different
and
if
you
want
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
would
not
make
any
difference
because
the
assignment
had
already,
they
would
not
reassign
them
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
is
lifted,
but
assume
the
other
side
wins
this
case
and
except
where
they
reassign
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
either
way
they
might
assign
or
reassign?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
way,
they
might
then
assign
or
reassign?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
there
any
difference
in
this
case
as
to
what
might
happen
as
to
who
might
win
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
insist
the
case
is
not
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
moot
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
moot
because
if
you
win
they
have
to
do
something
to
get
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appealsâ€™
opinion
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
school
board
now
goes
into
court
and
says
we
have
made
one
re-assignment
and
we
ask
that
the
order
be
de-terminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
is
what
you
think,
but
you
do
not
think
that
is
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
else
said
--
who
said
something
to
the
contrary?
the
dissent
certainly
would
agree
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
going
to
have
argument
in
the
district
court,
i
take
it?
