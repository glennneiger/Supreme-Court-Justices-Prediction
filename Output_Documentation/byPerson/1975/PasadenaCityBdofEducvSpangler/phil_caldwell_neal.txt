mr.
phil
c.
neal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
school
desegregation
case.
the
central
issue
it
presents
is
whether
a
school
district
that
has
been
in
compliance
with
the
desegregation
decree
for
an
extended
period
of
time
is
entitled
to
release
or
at
least
to
an
opportunity
to
attempt
new
and
different
solutions
to
the
problems
of
integration
and
educational
quality.
and
that
issue
in
turn,
i
would
suggest
may
require
some
further
consideration
of
what
are
the
ultimate
objectives
of
judicial
remedies
in
desegregation
cases.
and
i
would
say
what
the
case
does
not
involve,
the
case
does
not
involve
the
question
of
the
extent
at
which
compulsory
busing
may
be
used
as
part
of
the
desegregation
order
and
it
does
not
involve
issues
of
the
de
jure
versus
de
facto
segregation.
the
case
arises
on
a
petition
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
by
the
school
board
for
modification
of
the
court’s
original
desegregation
order.
that
order
had
been
issued
in
1970.
the
petition
for
modification
was
made
in
1974.
the
fourth
year
of
compliance
with
the
degree.
the
school
board
is
now
completing
its
sixth
year
of
compliance
with
the
decree.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court’s
denial
of
relief
by
a
divided
vote
and
with
three
quite
divergent
opinions.
to
review
the
facts
as
briefly
as
possible,
the
case
began
on
the
complaint
of
individual
parents,
alleging
unlawful
segregation
in
the
high
schools
of
pasadena.
the
united
states
intervened
and
broadened
the
case
to
include
all
the
schools
in
the
district.
after
hearing,
the
district
court
found
that
the
school
board
over
a
number
of
years
had
engaged
in
a
variety
of
acts
and
omissions
that
tended
to
accentuate
and
perpetuate
the
segregated
character
of
the
district
schools
which
fundamentally
was
based
as
you
might
expect
on
the
racial
residential
patterns
in
the
city.
the
sufficiency
of
those
findings
to
establish
a
predicate
for
a
de
jure
as
distinguished
from
de
facto
segregation
is
not
under
challenge
here.
on
the
basis
of
those
findings,
the
district
court
ordered
the
board
to
come
forward
with
a
plan
that
would
meet
the
requirement
that
no
school
in
the
district
have
a
majority
of
any
minority
students.
the
racial
composition
of
the
district
at
that
time
was
58%
white,
30%
black
and
12%
other
minorities.
at
the
time
the
petition
for
relief
was
filed,
the
figures
were
44%
white,
40%
black,
and
16%
other
minority.
the
plan
that
was
adapted
which
is
referred
to
in
the
record
as
the
pasadena
plan,
divided
the
district
into
four
somewhat
irregular,
elongated
zones,
each
having
a
racial
balance
that
matched
that
of
the
district
as
a
whole.
and
within
each
of
this
four
zones,
school
attendant’s
areas
were
established,
some
of
them
non-contiguous,
to
produce
in
each
school
approximately
the
same
racial
balance.
that
required
busing
for
about
50%
of
the
elementary
pupils,
52%
of
the
junior
high
pupils
and
27%
of
the
high
school
pupils.
that
plan
was
put
into
operation
for
the
school
year
beginning
in
the
fall
of
1970.
the
adoption
of
the
plan
and
particularly
the
failure
of
the
school
board
to
appeal
the
district
court’s
order,
generated
a
great
deal
of
opposition
and
controversy
in
pasadena.
at
first
there
was
a
recall
election
which
failed
to
achieve
the
required
two-thirds
majority,
but
then
there
were
successive
of
elections
of
new
board
members
that
resulted
overtime
in
creating
a
board
that
had
pledged
itself
to
seek
modification
of
the
plan.
and
i
might
say
that
the
issues
in
the
election
campaigns
centered
on
opposition
to
force
busing
support
for
neighborhood
schools
and
also
emphasize
concern
about
the
quality
of
education
in
the
pasadena
schools
and
the
problem
of
the
declining
white
population
in
the
city.
and
the
theme
that
was
constantly
reiterated
in
the
election
campaigns
was
that
there
must
be
better
ways
and
that
there
were
better
ways
or
the
better
ways
would
be
found
to
achieve
integration
in
the
plan
that
the
court
had
ordered.
i
think
it
should
be
said
here
that
there
was
never
at
any
time,
any
violence
or
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
parents,
children,
or
the
school
board
to
carrying
out
the
order.
this
was
a
city
where
so
far
as
the
operation
of
the
plan
was
concerned,
everything
went
smoothly.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
five-member
school
board.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
three
years
i
think
it
is.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
not
all.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
it
is
a
staggered
term,
yes.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
i
am
advised
to
two-year
term
mr.
justice
stewart.
well,
in
1971
the
newly
elected,
the
first
of
the
newly
elected
board
members
proposed
a
modified
plan
to
the
board
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
plans
that
were
considered
by
the
school
board
over
time
for
changing
the
plan
that
had
been
ordered
by
the
court.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
stress
here
that
it
was
explicitly
contemplated
from
the
beginning
that
if
and
when
the
board
agreed
on
a
new
plan,
that
plan
was
going
to
be
submitted
to
the
district
court
for
permission
to
proceed.
it
was
never
suggested
in
any
way
that
the
board’s
action
in
the
meantime
should
be
anything
other
than
full
compliance
and
cooperation
with
the
existing
plan.
now,
the
first
two
versions
of
the
modified
plan
were
not
adapted,
but
ultimately
in
december
of
1973,
the
board
agreed
on
a
third
version
and
it
was
that
plan
that
was
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
early
1974.
the
board’s
petition
to
the
court
sought
two
different
kinds
of
relief.
the
first
was
that
the
school
district
be
relieved
of
judicial
supervision
on
the
ground
that
it
had
become
a
unitary
school
system
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
second,
if
that
relief
were
not
granted
that
the
decree
be
modified
and
i
will
address
myself
first
to
the
request
for
relief
from
active
supervision,
all
these
relief
was
denied.
the
board’s
position
in
the
district
court
as
well
as
here
is
that
it
has
by
its
compliance
for
the
then
period
of
four
years
and
now
six
years
met
the
appropriate
standard
for
release
from
detailed
judicial
supervision
of
school
desegregation.
this
court
has
not
yet
spoken
on
what
that
standard
is.
however,
the
school
district
has
met
what
appears
to
be
the
standard
that
has
been
followed
in
other
courts,
notably
in
the
fifth
circuit
were
the
problem
has
been
faced
repeatedly.
and
it
is
not
the
standard
that
respondent,
the
united
states
urged
in
those
cases.
the
board’s
proof
on
this
point
consisted
essentially
of
a
stipulation
at
the
beginning
of
a
trial
in
which
the
respondents,
in
which
the
government
stipulated
without
qualification
that
there
have
been
no
violations
of
the
decree
of
which
it
was
aware
during
the
period
of
the
plan's
operation.
the
individual
respondents
qualified
that
stipulation
in
minor
respects
that
i
will
mention
in
a
moment.
the
district
court
relied
on
only
one
circumstance
as
indicating
lack
of
compliance
with
its
judgment,
with
its
order.
that
was
a
fact
that
over
the
four-year
period
in
which
the
plan
had
been
in
operation,
five
elementary
schools
had
developed
minor
deviations
from
the
no
majority
of
the
minority
requirement.
those
were
deviations
that
were
due
to
demographic
changes
in
those
districts
and
the
government,
indeed
both
respondents
agree
that
until
the
hearing
itself,
until
the
course
of
the
hearing
before
the
district
judge,
no
one
had
supposed
that
the
court
order
required
annual
redistricting
to
correct
for
minor
changes
in
the
racial
balance
that
resulted
from
shifts
in
population.
the
district
court
expressed
a
contrary
view
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
itself
and
that
was
the
only
circumstance
relied
on
by
the
district
court
as
indicating
a
departure
from
the
court
order.
there
was
another
fact
that
was
adverted
to
in
the
hearing
and
has
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs
here,
namely
that
in
the
case
of
five
administrative
appointments
of
an
acting
and
temporary
character,
the
school
board
had
not
gone
through
the
detailed
personnel
procedures
that
were
spelled
out
in
the
plan
and
which
indeed
were
part
of
the
pasadena
school
system's
existing
procedures.
the
board
was
under
the
understanding
that
it
was
not
compelled
in
acting
in
temporary
appointments
to
go
through
these
procedures.
once
again,
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
before
the
district
court,
the
judge
said
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
they
had
to.
the
board
promptly
proceeded
to
initiate
procedures
for
permanent
appointments
to
replace
these
acting
appointees
following
the
detailed
procedures.
after
the
opinion
and
order
that
are
our
concern
here,
were
handed
down,
contempt
proceedings
were
initiated,
although
the
court
made
no
reference
to
this
matter
in
its
decision
denying
relief,
contempt
proceedings
were
initiated,
centered
on
the
point
that
the
board,
although
it
had
began
the
process
of
reappointment
had
not
immediately
vacated
these
five
administrative
positions.
and
once
again,
it
was
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings
that
the
district
court
made
clear
that
that
was
what
he
had
wanted
and
he
held
the
board
in
contempt
for
not
having
vacated
and
that
order
is
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
appeal.
now,
that
second
incident
did
not
figure
as
i
say
in
the
district
court’s
action.
we
believe
that
no
substantial
reason
has
been
offered
for
not
according
the
pasadena
school
board
the
same
relief
from
judicial
supervision
that
has
been
found
appropriate
in
numerous
other
cases.
we
submit
that
the
government,
although
it
appears
to
advocate
that
general
standard
has
not
offered
here
any
substantial
reasons
for
not
applying
it
to
the
pasadena
school
board.
there
seems
to
be
a
suggestion
among
others
in
the
government’s
brief
that
the
very
fact
that
the
school
board
was
applying
for
a
modification
of
the
decree
of
the
plan,
somehow
a
reason
for
finding
that
it
was
not
entitled
to
be
released
from
active
supervision
because
that
would
suggest
that
the
plan
would
change
after
the
release.
we
suggest
that
is
a
very
paradoxical
kind
of
reason,
that
the
whole
purpose
for
contemplating
termination
of
active
regulation
and
substituting
a
general
injunction
in
the
form
that
other
courts
have
done
is
to
permit
the
school
board
to
have
flexibility
in
arranging
its
affairs
and
if
it
were
expected
to
go
on
indefinitely
with
the
court
order
plan,
it
would
not
be
any
point
in
ever
bringing
these
proceedings
to
a
termination.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
pasadena
school
board,
some
subsequent
events
have
underscored
the
importance
at
some
point
in
time,
bringing
this
detailed
judicial
supervision
to
a
conclusion
and
that
concerns
the
so
called
audubon
matter
which
has
subsequently
come
to
the
court
in
a
different
form,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
granted
a
stay
in
december
in
this
other
matter
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
case.
that
matter
arose
out
of
the
pasadena
school
district’s
fundamental
school’s
program.
one
of
the
things
that
the
school
board
had
done
since
the
beginning
of
this
whole
proceeding
was
to
establish
a
number
of
so-called
fundamental
schools,
emphasizing
traditional
teaching
and
including
such
fundamentals
as
this
court
helps
keep
alive
that
is
to
say
they
require
the
school
teachers
to
wear
coats
and
ties
in
the
classrooms
and
the
emphasis
is
upon
rigorous
teaching
of
basic
educational
subject.
the
evidence
so
far
is
that
the
school
board
has
had
considerable
success
in
this
program
in
elevating
the
achievement
of
students
in
the
program
both
white
and
black,
but
particularly
with
the
minority
students.
at
the
time
the
district
court
denied
relief
in
this
proceeding,
it
expressed
the
view
that
the
board
could
accomplish
whatever
it
wanted
to
in
the
way
of
its
special
programs,
including
the
fundamental
program
under
the
existing
decree.
a
year
later,
the
proposed
to
establish
a
new
fundamental
school
this
one
in
a
predominantly
black
section
of
pasadena
for
the
purpose,
both
of
making
it
easier
on
a
black
students
who
were
presently
attending
the
fundamental
schools
voluntarily
and
being
bused
to
long
distances
and
secondly
in
order
to
attract
more
black
students
in
that
neighborhood
into
a
fundamental
school.
fundamental
school
program
is
entirely
voluntary
and
it
maintains
strict
racial
balance
both
in
the
voluntary
school
and
in
ascending
school
so
there
is
absolutely
no
question
here
about
racial
balance
or
departing
from
the
decree
in
that
respect.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
the
district
court’s
order
required
no
school
have
a
majority
of
any
minority
and
it
is
that
requirement
that
i
refer
to,
given
the
very
close
racial
balance
in
the
district
that
requirement
in
the
case
of
pasadena
comes
very
close
to
a
requirement
that
each
school
mirror
the
racial
composition
of
the
district.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
of
the
entire
district.
yes.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
that
was
his
original
order.
that
was
the
heart
of
his
original
order.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
no,
that
is
the
standard.
it
has
been
the
standard
from
the
beginning
and
that
has
not
been
modified
and
the
school
board
in
this
proceeding
requested
modification,
really
requested
disillusion
of
that
requirement
because
given
the
close
racial
balance
in
the
district
that
was
increasingly
hard
to
comply
with.
so
that
the
district
as
it
now
stands
is
really
under
an
order
to
maintain
in
every
school
a
racial
balance
that
is
very
close
to
the
racial
balance
in
the
district.
you
cannot
depart
very
much
from
40%
without
going
over
the
50%
that
the
injunction
forbids.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
yes
sir.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
yes
sir,
that
is
our
fundamental
contention
on
that
part
of
the
petition
for
modification
that
seek
to
eliminate
the
no
majority
of
a
minority
requirement.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
i
know
they
say
that
mr.
justice
powell,
but
if
one
reads
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
that
out
of
them
clearly.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
no
sir
and
the
court
of
appeals
merely
affirmed
the
district
court’s
order
which
denied
everything
that
it
had
been
asked
for.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
modify
the
order.
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
audubon
school
matter
which
came
on
after
the
court
of
appeals'
opinions
were
handed
down
that
the
district
court
regards
the
no
majority
of
the
minority
requirement
as
still
in
force
and
indeed
as
still
requiring
constant
readjustment
to
maintain
the
required
balance
in
the
several
schools.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
no,
the
only
contempt
matter
related
to
these
administrative
appointments
that
i
referred
to
earlier.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
i
think
you
could
argue
that
the
annual
readjustment
part
was
settled
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
judge
ely’s
opinion
as
judge
wallace
said,
judge
ely’s
opinion
clearly
contemplated
that
the
general
requirement
of
no
majority
of
a
minority
would
go
on
indefinitely.
so
there
is
no
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
point
and
i
think
with
deference
that
the
government
is
stretching
things
when
it
suggested
there
is
no
need
for
relief
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
already
taken
care
of
the
problem.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
they
are
not
yet
a
majority
--
mr.
phil
c.
neal
well
that
is
right,
impossible
then,
very
difficult
now.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
well,
that
is
one
of
our
requests
for
modification.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
well,
i
think
there
must
come
a
time,
i
think
that
is
a
fundamental
question
this
court
needs
to
face,
it
certainly
has
happened
in
other
districts,
but
it
cannot
well
be
i
suggest
that
a
school
district
is
to
operate
indefinitely
under
the
detailed
supervision
of
the
judge.
and
if
i
can
just
finish
on
the
fundamental
school
thing,
the
ironic
outcome
of
that
was
that
the
district
judge
enjoined
the
formation,
not
only
of
this
fundamental
school,
but
if
any
others
until
the
board
was
able
to
satisfy
him
that
they
had
gone
through
all
kinds
of
calculations
would
make
this
the
least
disruptive
choice
possible.
mr.
phil
c.
neal
well,
your
honor
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
basis
for
--
supposing
that
the
lifting
of
this
decree
would
result
in
a
lot
of
all
black
and
all
white
schools,
the
school
district
had
proposed
an
alternative
plan
and
i
would
like
to
spend
several
minutes
discussing
what
the
alternative
plan
was.
the
district
court
rejected
that
on
the
ground
that
it
involved
freedom
of
choice.
what
the
board
wanted
to
do
was
something
that
could
be
regarded
as
very
creative
and
enterprising
and
forward
looking.
they
wanted
to
take
each
one
of
these
zones
that
it
has
been
establish
by
the
decree
and
make
them
fluid
zones
without
attendance
areas
and
by
trying
to
provide
incentives
in
differentiated
schools,
every
school
differentiated
to
draw
students
voluntarily
away
from
their
neighborhood
schools
and
into
an
integrated
situation.
now,
that
is
experimental.
it
is
bold
perhaps.
they
had
some
solid
basis
for
believing
it
might
work
because
of
the
great
success
they
had
had
with
this
fundamental
schools
in
drawing
blacks
and
whites
into
an
integrated
school
and
the
school
board
said
let
us
try
it
and
give
it
a
chance
to
work.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
we
knew
that
the
board
could
succeed,
if
we
could
look
back
and
see
the
pasadena
school
board
having
had
success
with
this
plan,
it
would
have
been
much
more
progress
toward
the
ultimate
goal
of
brown
versus
board
of
education
and
everything
since
than
if
the
board
simply
went
along
indefinitely
under
this
compulsory
racial
balancing
decree.
that
really
is
the
ultimate
irony
of
the
case,
i
think
because
this
school
board
had
gone
along
passively,
and
merely
carried
out
the
court’s
decree
and
made
no
effort
to
develop
the
innovative
programs
that
it
did
and
the
fundamental
school
program
and
no
effort
to
come
back
and
seek
relief
from
the
decree,
there
would
come
a
time
when
it
was
released
from
the
court’s
order.
and
at
that
point
i
suppose
it
could
have
gone
back
to
some
perfectly
neutral
attendance
zone
system
done
by
computer
perhaps
that
would
have
resulted
in
a
lot
of
segregation
because
of
the
residential
pattern
and
only
helped
things
along
the
fringes.
whereas
the
actual
plan
of
the
board
has
pressed
for
here
is
one
that
might
ultimately
produce
much
more
integration
than
that
kind
of
an
acceptable
plan
would
do
and
i
would
suggest
that
that
kind
of
an
objective
comes
closer
to
the
long
stated
goal
of
having
not
black
schools
and
not
white
schools,
but
just
school
than
a
mere
caring
forward
indefinitely
of
the
no
majority
of
a
minority
requirement.
so
our
submission
is
that
the
result
reached
by
the
district
court
in
refusing
to
relinquish
jurisdiction,
in
refusing
to
modify
the
no
majority
requirement
would
seem
to
be
squarely
interface
of
this
one
decision
and
in
dismissing
out
of
hand,
the
board's
request
for
an
alternative
plan
is
a
perversion
of
the
function
of
equity
in
school
desegregation
cases.
thank
you.
