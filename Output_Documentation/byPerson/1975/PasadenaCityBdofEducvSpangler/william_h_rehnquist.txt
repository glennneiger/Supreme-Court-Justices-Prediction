bork,
perhaps
you

now.
if

just
some

during

would
you
address
yourself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
no
majority
of
any
minority
provision
of
the
1970
decree
entered
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
contemplated
annual

in

solely
by

of

if
it
did,
is
it

pasadena
city
board
of
education
versus
spangler,
the
district
court
in
1970
in
the
central
district
of
california,
as
a
result
of
an
action
originally
brought
by
high
school
students
and
their
parents,
found
that
the
unified
school
district
of
pasadena
was
unconstitutionally
segregated.
the
court
thereupon
ordered
the
defendant
school
district
officials
to
prepare
and
submit
a
plan
for
the
de-segregation
of
these
public
schools.
one
aspect
of
the
required
plan
was
the
re-drawing
of
the
attendance
zones
for
the
pasadena
schools,
a
requirement
which
the
district
court
said,
had
to
include
provisions
ensuring
that
there
would
be
no
majority
of
any
minority
racial
group
attending
any
pasadena
school.
the
school
officials
prepared
the
requested
plan
which
was
submitted
to
and
approved
by
the
district
court.
the
plan
was
put
into
operation,
beginning
with
the
1970-71
academic
year
and
the
pasadena
school
officials
were
under
its
terms
for
the
next
four
years.
in
1974,
however,
these
officials
sought
relief
from
further
compliance
with
the
1970
decree.
they
argued
that
they
had
met
their
application
of
de-segregating
the
pasadena
public
schools
and
should
be
released
from
the
further
supervision
of
the
federal
court
or
in
the
alternative
that
they
were
at
least
entitled
to
revision
of
some
aspects
of
the
plan.
central
to
this
alternative
contention
was
the
schools
official's
argument
that
deviation
from
the
district
court's
formula
had
resulted
from
the
demographic
changes
in
the
pasadena
school
district,
the
moving
in
and
about
pasadena
of
population,
and
the
district
court
could
not,
therefore,
require
annual
shifting
of
boundaries
to
confirm
to
it's
no
majority
of
any
minority
guideline.
the
district
court
rejected
these
requests
for
relief
and
ordered
the
plan
continued
in
full
effect.
the
court
also
made
clear
it's
intention
to
require
annual
re-drawing
of
the
school
district's
attended
zones
so
there
would
never
be
a
majority
of
any
minority
in
a
pasadena
school.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
upheld
the
district
court's
decision,
although
in
the
course
of
doing
it
so,
it
cast
some
doubt
upon
the
correctness
of
some
of
the
statements
made
by
the
district
court.
for
reasons
more
fully
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
a
clerk
this
morning,
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
exceeded
it's
authority
in
attempting
to
require
the
school
district
to
re-draw
attendance
zones
each
year
so
as
to
ensure
that
the
racial
balance
in
the
public
schools
would
never
violate
it's
no
majority
of
any
minority
directive.
the
school
officials
had
submitted
a
racially
neutral
attendance
zone
scheme
to
the
district
court
in
1970.
the
court
approved
the
plan
and
implemented
it.
having
done
so,
we
think
it's
authority
to
order
further
alterations
of
the
attendance
patterns
in
this
case
was
at
an
end
unless
subsequent
disparities
in
the
actual
attendance
of
those
schools
could
be
shown
to
be
the
result
of
segregated
actions
chargeable
to
the
defendant
school
officials.
there
was
no
such
showing
in
this
case.
accordingly,
we
conclude
that
the
lower
courts
erred
in
determining
that
the
school
officials
could
be
required
to
rearrange
their
attendance
zones
each
year
in
response
to
normal
demographic
changes
in
the
pasadena
area.
we,
therefore,
vacate
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings.
