mr.
philip
c.
neal
i
have
these
two
minutes
i
think
your
honor.
that
obviously
does
not
allow
me
time
to
try
to
reply
to
mr.
okrand’s
somewhat
a
capella
treatment
of
the
record.
mr.
philip
c.
neal
thank
you.
thank
you
your
honor.
but
as
to
the
record
i
will
have
to
rely
i
think
upon
our
briefs
and
upon
this
court’s
own
examination
of
the
record.
let
me
correct
one
thing
that
i
think
is
of
importance.
it
is
not
true
that
board
never
asked
for
modification
of
the
no
majority
no
minority
requirement.
that
appears
explicitly
on
the
motion
that
the
233
of
the
record,
the
first
paragraph
of
the
motion.
i
think
i
would
like
to
take
this
few
instances
that
i
have
to
speak
to
mr.
bork’s
position
which
i
find
somewhat
perplexing
because
as
i
understand
it,
he
thinks
we
are
really
entitled
to
the
relief
that
we
are
asking,
but
he
is
confident
that
it
has
already
been
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
an
examination
of
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
will
make
clear
that
it
was
only
judge
chambers,
who
said
if
we
redistricted
once
more
we
would
be
entitled
to
be
free
of
that
requirement.
neither
he
nor
judge
ely
addressed
himself
to
the
question
at
what
point
we
would
be
entitled
to
be
relieved
from
active
judicial
supervision.
mr.
bork,
if
mr.
bork
thinks
that
all
we
need
to
do
now
is
go
back
before
judge
real
(ph)
and
say
everything
is
over
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
mr.
bork
is
simply
unfamiliar
with
the
course
of
the
school
boards
relationships
with
judge
real
and
this
entire
proceeding.
and
i
think
any
such
notion
is
totally
dispelled
if
the
court
will
take
a
look
at
any
part
of
the
record
on
the
audubon
proceeding
which
is
before
this
court
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
thing
in
that
connection.
there
was
testimony
from
that
audubon
proceeding
that
was
relied
upon
in
a
government
brief
which
is
cited
at
page
13
or
15
of
the
government
brief
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
inclusion
in
the
government’s
brief
that
i
asked
the
solicitor
general,
if
he
would
lodge
the
entire
record
and
the
record
is
lodged
and
we
have
discussed
it
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
think
that
should
completely
dispel
any
notion
that
this
problem
can
be
eradicated
by
merely
sending
the
case
back
without
this
court
saying
anything.
so,
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
like
to
re-emphasize
two
points.
the
courts
below
have
clearly
misconceived
the
swann
decision,
what
that
case
said
might
be
taken
as
inappropriate
starting
point
as
has
been
made
in
this
case,
the
end
point,
the
total
objective
of
the
remedial
process
and
apparently
for
an
indefinite
period.
aside
from
that
fatal
flaw,
the
judgment
should
at
the
very
least
be
remanded
with
some
guidance
from
this
court
as
to
when
and
how
the
school
board
will
have
satisfied
the
requirement
that
it
be
a
unitary
district
so
that
it
can
be
released
from
the
straight
jacket
that
has
been
in
for
now
six
years.
