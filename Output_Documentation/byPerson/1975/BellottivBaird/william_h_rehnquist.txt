justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
three-judge
district
court
had
the
benefit
of
any
state
court
construction
in
reaching
that
interpretation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
three-judge
court
give
any
consideration
or
was
it
asked
to
give
any
consideration
to
abstaining
in
order
to
prevent
the
massachusetts
courts
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
in
affect
that
even
though
the
three-judge
court
is
not
to
abstained,
it
was
obligated
to
construe
the
state
statute
more
narrowly
than
it
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
say
that
the
three-judge
district
court
should
have
left
the
statute
standing
and
in
particular
cases,
perhaps
there
might
have
been
an
unconstitutional
application,
but
it
would
be
sufficient
for
that
evil
for
the
day,
so
to
speak?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
alleged
to
be
residing
with
her
parents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
the
massachusetts
courts
would
not
either
on
their
probate
side
or
on
their
equity
side
make
some
provision
for
expedited
hearing
if
they
thought
there
was
an
emergency
even
though
the
statute
does
not
so
many
words
say
they
should?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
when
you
say
that
you
are
suggesting
it,
you
are
relying
on
some
provision
on
massachusetts
law
or
some
customer
practice
in
massachusetts
that
you
know
of,
now
what
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
correct,
but
certainly
i
do
not
know
if
you
practiced
in
massachusetts
or
not,
but
i
would
gather
that
in
most
states
there
are
any
number
of
court
rules
or
customs
that
are
made
to
accommodate
the
situations
where
the
statute
is
completely
silent
on
the
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
at
least
had
gone
part
way
towards
curing
that
if
it
did
had
a
chance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
the
more
different
the
problems
and
the
more
diverse
the
problems
are,
the
more
you
make
out
a
classical
case
where
the
district
court
should
have
abstained.
here
the
constitutional
question
of
the
necessity
of
the
parent’s
consent
is
one
that
is
reserved
and
rolled
and
the
district
court
had
an
opportunity
with
this
consent
provision
to
say
and
let
the
state
court
put
it
in
a
different
posture
and
come
back
here
and
tell
them,
then
we
will
decide
the
constitutional
question.
it
seems
to
me
hard
to
justify
their
failure
to
abstain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
presumably,
the
massachusetts
legislature
was
willing
to
have
that
burden
placed
on
the
state
courts
when
it
enacted
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
would
have
had
standing
to
attack
the
statute
if
in
fact
her
parents
had
consented
her
or
would
have
consented
if
she
asked
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
do
you
not
think
the
state
has
quite
illegitimate
objection
to
the
district
court’s
refusal
to
divulge
to
the
state
which
who
was
defending
the
action,
the
names
of
the
parents
because
really,
all
we
have
is
the
assertion
of
the
plaintiff
that
her
parents
did
not
consent.
the
state
never
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
parents
and
see
whether
perhaps
they
might
have
consented?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
if
her
parents
had
in
fact
consented
she
would
not
have
standing
to
bring
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
state
was
never
enable
to
find
out
in
effect
whether
she
had
standing
because
they
were
not
permitted
to
examine
her
parents
as
to
whether
they
would
have
consented?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
we
have
is
her
say
so.
ordinarily
in
a
lawsuit
you
are
entitled
to
examine,
all
she
did
was
make
representations
as
to
what
her
parents
would
have
done.
ordinarily
in
a
lawsuit,
you
are
entitled
to
examine
the
people
about
them,
the
representations
are
made
to
see
if
they
are
proved
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
he
is
probing
out
--
what
he
was
probing
out
and
what
i
am
concerned
about
is
how
do
we
know
if
the
parents
would
not
have
consented
and
that
there
would
have
been
no
case
here
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
to
follow-up
on
justice
steven’s
question,
instead
of
just
wanting
to
wear
an
armband,
they
wanted
to
have
an
armband
tattoo
in
such
a
way
that
there
was
medical
evidence
to
suggest
there
was
some
danger
attached.
now,
would
your
answer
still
be
the
same?
