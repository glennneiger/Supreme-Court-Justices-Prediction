mr.
brian
a.
riley
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
at
the
outset,
we
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
this
is
not
an
abortion
case
in
our
mind,
but
rather
deals
with
the
issues
of
medical
treatment
of
minors
and
informed
consent.
the
fundamental
issue
raised
by
this
appeal
is
whether
the
parents
would
be
given
the
opportunity
to
exercise
their
right
and
duty
to
guide
and
protect
their
children
in
medical
decisions.
this
includes
abortions
as
well
as
all
other
medical
decisions.
the
intervenors
submit
that
roe
versus
wade
and
doe
versus
bolton
lend
no
support
to
the
plaintiff’s
contentions.
wade
and
bolton
involved
an
adult
woman’s
right
to
effectuate
a
reasoned
and
informed
decision
to
terminate
a
pregnancy.
these
cases
concerned
adult
woman
who
have
always
been
considered
capable
of
giving
a
valid
and
informed
consent
to
medical
treatment.
in
the
present
case,
however,
we
are
concerned
of
minors.
minors
have
always
been
deemed
incapable
as
a
class
of
giving
an
informed
consent
to
medical
treatment.
the
court
in
bolton
held
that
an
abortion
is
merely
a
medical
procedure
and
should
not
be
differentiated
from
other
medical
procedures.
the
same
is
true
of
minors
who
seek
medical
treatment.
they
should
not
be
treated
differently
than
minors
who
seek
other
forms
of
medical
treatment.
the
lower
court
acknowledged
this
fact
when
it
held
that
dr.
zupnick
could
not
legally
perform
abortions
on
minors
that
were
not
capable
of
giving
an
informed
consent.
the
lower
court
found,
however,
that
it
was
insignificant
that
there
were
certain
number
of
minors
who
are
capable
of
in
fact
giving
an
informed
consent.
the
court
nevertheless
found
that
in
determining
whether
a
particular
minor
is
or
is
not
capable
of
giving
an
informed
consent
that
there
would
be
factual
questions
to
weigh
in
each
case.
the
essence
of
this
appeal
is
who
should
weigh
these
factual
questions.
who
should
determine
whether
a
particular
girl
is
capable
of
giving
an
informed
consent?
who
should
assist
her
in
this
decision
making
process?
should
it
be
the
doctor,
should
it
be
her
parents,
or
should
it
be
a
judge
of
the
superior
court?
the
intervenors
submit
that
the
parents,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
should
aid
her
in
this
decision.
this
is
in
accord
with
a
long
line
of
decisions
which
hold
that
the
care,
custody,
and
nurture
of
children
reside
first
in
parents
and
in
no
one
else.
the
intervenors
submit
that
parents
at
least
in
this
first
instance,
should
be
given
the
opportunity,
opportunity
to
guide
their
children
in
this
decision.
this
is
not
only
their
right,
but
it
is
also
their
duty
and
obligation
to
do
so.
all
the
experts
in
this
case
agree
that
an
unplanned
pregnancy
for
a
minor
girl
is
accompanied
by
a
great
period
of
stress.
these
girls
are
typically
scared,
frightened,
they
are
desperate
children.
one
expert
described
these
girls
as
upset,
withdrawn,
non-communicative,
and
anxious.
expert
testimony
reveals
that
such
an
adolescent
is
often
compelled
to
seek
an
immediate
solution
to
the
problem.
they
want
instant
relief.
it
is
crucial
at
this
point,
that
this
decision
to
abort
be
the
product
of
an
informed
and
reasoned
consent,
and
not
merely
a
desire
for
instant
relief
from
the
crisis
she
faces
at
the
moment.
the
minor
girl
is
entitled
to
and
must
obtain
proper
guidance
in
assessing
the
risk,
the
complications,
and
the
alternatives
to
the
abortion
procedure.
this
guidance
is
generally
supplied
to
her
in
all
other
surgical
procedures.
it
is
important
that
the
girl
resolve
in
her
mind,
that
whatever
choice
she
makes,
is
the
product
of
reflection
and
not
a
reaction
to
the
crisis
that
she
is
in.
all
of
the
experts
agreed
that
parental
support
and
guidance
is
extremely
necessary
to
help
a
child
through
this
difficult
period
in
her
life.
it
is
submitted
that
the
great
majority
of
parents
will
provide
their
children
with
the
proper
guidance
and
support
that
they
are
entitled
to.
parents
are
the
ones
who
are
most
interested
in
ensuring
that
their
daughter
receives
proper
medical
care
and
guidance.
parents
are
best
suited
to
aid
her
in
choosing
a
doctor
and
a
medical
facility
which
offers
the
quality
of
interest
and
sensitivity
that
can
deal
with
this
delicate
problem
for
the
child.
finally,
parental
concern
and
involvement
will
ensure
that
there
is
proper
follow-up
medical
care
for
the
child
if
it
is
necessary,
whether
it
be
medical
or
psychiatric,
or
both.
although
the
great
majority
of
parents
would
act
in
the
best
interests
of
their
minor
children,
the
intervenors
acknowledge
that
some
may
not.
the
question
then,
is
who
should
fill
this
void?
should
it
be
the
doctor
or
should
it
be
the
state?
the
intervenors
submit
that
is
should
be
a
judge
of
the
superior
court
rather
than
a
doctor.
judges
have
always
been
resorted
to,
when
a
conflict
develops
over
whether
a
parent
is
acting
in
the
best
interest
of
their
child's
health
and
well
being.
judges
have
always
been
resorted
to,
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
child
is
in
need
of
a
particular
medical
procedure.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
it
is
a
very
informal
procedure
in
my
mind.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
i
would
say
that
a
child
could
go
into
the
court
and
have
a
hearing
within
the
day
that
she
goes
in,
and
there
is
a
daily
motion
session
in
most
of
the
courts
of
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
where
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
no.
i
would
imagine
that
a
matter
of
this
nature
would
take
presence
on
the
calendar
and
that
the
--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
well,
in
other
situations
where
medical
treatment
is
necessary,
for
example,
a
blood
transfusion
or
other
medical
treatment
that
is
necessary
and
has
to
be
performed
within
a
particular
period
of
time,
state
court
systems
have
been
able
to
adjust
and
adopt
themselves
to
deal
with
that
problem
and
provide
the
necessary
hearing
and
make
the
necessary
determination
as
to
whether
or
not--
mr.
brian
a.
riley
well,
as
far
as
the
supreme
court
judge
may
have
a
hearing,
the
statute
provides
a
hearing
as
he
deems
necessary.
there
would
need
to
be
no
guardian
appointed
for
the
child.
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
rules
of
court
have
been
developed.
this
statute
has
never
gone
into
effect.
the
courts
themselves
in
the
superior
court
have
their
own
rules
of
court
to
deal
with
particular
procedures.
they
do
this
with
criminal
matters
and
with
civil
matters.
they
could
create
an
expeditious
procedure
to
deal
with
the
problem.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
we
have
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
it
is
daily
in
most
counties.
mr.
brian
a.
riley
thank
you.
