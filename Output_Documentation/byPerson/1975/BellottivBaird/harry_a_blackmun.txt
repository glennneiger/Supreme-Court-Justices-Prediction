justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
one
way
for
the
state
to
attack
that
problem
would
be
to
require
that
a
physician
consult
with
the
patient,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
rather
than
to
go
about
the
way
they
have
done
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
understanding
this
case
for
your
massachusetts
statute,
it
is
different
from
the
missouri
one
and
that
it
requires
the
consent
of
both
parents?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
here
then
one
parent
has
absolute
veto
power.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
when
they
were
separated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
do
not
think
i
have
this
straight.
you
say
if
parents
are
separated
that
the
consent
of
only
one
is
necessary?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
one
parent
were
diseased
or
has
deserted
his
or
her
family,
that
then
only
the
consent
of
one
would
be
sufficient?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
tie
into
your
statute
really
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
riley,
enlighten
me
on
the
massachusetts
situation.
how
available
is
a
procedure
of
this
kind
time-wise
in
the
superior
court
in
massachusetts?
is
there
a
three-year
waiting
period
or
--?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
am
not
asking
about
formality
or
informality.
i
am
asking
about
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
not
the
backlog
that
would
delay
this
for
weeks?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
does
your
statute
still
provide?
the
answer
is
no,
and
i
am
really
asking
that
we
hear
here
constantly
about
the
delay
in
courts.
we
are
aware
of
it
pretty
well
on
the
federal
side,
and
i
am
really
asking
what
the
massachusetts
situation
is.
if
someone
wanted
relief
by
way
of
a
court
hearing
whether
she
would
have
to
wait
for
one
month
or
three
years,
this
is
a
time
imperative
situation,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
am
not
asking
that
some
have
not,
and
i
am
asking
what
the
massachusetts
situation
is,
apparently
you
do
not
know?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
shown
an
exception,
mr.
lucas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
say
you
have
spoken
of
unfettered
control,
is
not
the
massachusetts
for
a
good
cause
shown
provision
and
exception?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
it
make
it
a
little
easier
or
harder
then.
what
about
girl
is
having
her
ears
pierced
for
earrings?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
are
dangers
of
infection
with
ear
piercing
as
you
know?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
unless
so
when
a
nurse
does
it
then
why
not
a
physician
does
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
case
is
number
75-73
and
75-109,
bellotti
against
baird
and
hunerwadel
against
baird.
this
comes
to
us
from
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts.
that
commonwealth
in
1974
enacted
a
statute,
governing
the
type
of
consent,
including
parental
consent
required
before
an
abortion
may
be
performed
on
an
unmarried
women
under
the
age
of
18.
the
appellee's
here
are
an
abortion
counseling
organization,
it's
president
and
it's
medical
director
and
several
unmarried
pregnant
women.
they
brought
a
class
action
against
the
massachusetts
attorney
general
and
the
district
attorneys
of
several
counties
of
the
commonwealth,
claiming
that
the
statute
violated
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
entered
a
temporary
restraining
order
before
statute
became
affective.
that
court
later
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
creating
a
parental
veto
over
the
performance
of
abortions
on
minors,
in
that
it
applied
even
to
those
minors
who
were
capable
of
giving
informed
consents.
the
court
then
permanently
enjoined
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
denied,
at
least
by
implication,
the
appellant's
motion
that
the
court
of
abstain,
pending
an
authoritative
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
massachusetts'
supreme
judicial
court.
in
1975,
after
the
district
court
had
made
it's
decision,
but
prior
to
argument
here,
massachusetts
enacted
another
statute
dealing
with
consent
by
minors
to
medical
procedures
other
than
abortion
and
sterilization
and
as
a
consequence
in
this
court,
the
appellee's
raised
an
additional
claim
of
impermissible
distinction
between
the
consent
procedures
applicable
to
minors
in
the
area
of
abortion
under
the
74
statute
and
the
consent
required
by
the
75
statute
in
regard
to
other
medical
procedures
on
minors.
the
court
holds
and
it
does
so
unanimously
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
from
deciding
the
constitutional
issue
and
should
have
certified
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
appropriate
questions
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
74
statute
and
the
procedure
it
imposes.
the
74
statute
at
least
as
the
attorney
general
represented
it
is
susceptible
of
the
appellant's
interpretation
that
it
would
permit
a
minor
capable
of
giving
informed
consent
to
obtain
a
court
order,
allowing
abortion
without
parental
consultation
and
would
further
permit
even
a
minor
incapable
of
giving
a
informed
consent
to
obtain
an
abortion
order
without
parental
consultation,
where
it
is
shown
that
the
abortion
would
be
in
her
best
interest.
an
interpretation
of
that
kind,
should
it
be
forthcoming,
with
a
void
or
substantially
modified
the
federal
constitutional
challenge
to
the
statute.
we
further
hold
that
the
claim
of
impermissible
discrimination
due
to
the
75
statute
is
dependent
upon
the
meaning
of
the
74
statute,
and
therefore,
is
similarly
subject
to
abstention.
we,
therefore,
suggest
that
it
would
not
be
inappropriate
for
the
district
court
on
remand
to
certify
an
appropriate
question
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
75
statute
in
the
light
of
the
74
one.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
therefore
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
consistent
with
the
opinion
that
has
been
filed
today.
