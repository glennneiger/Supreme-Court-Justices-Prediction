mr.

before
you
go
on,
i
suppose
massachusetts
has
a
customary
law
requiring
parental
consent
for
matter
to
marry?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
wanted
to
ask
your
opinion
of
verdict
that
was
addressed
in
the
case
that
preceded
yours
is
whether
you
think
the
reasoning,
the
rationale
of
the
three-judge
court
in
your
case,
if
adopted
by
us,
would
necessitate
the
invalidating
of
the
massachusetts
consent
to
marriage
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
state
in
the
same
reasons
suggested,
have
included
the
parental
interest
in
the
childâ€™s
welfare?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
included
in
both
instances
i
take
it,
the
consent
to
marriage
and
the
consent
to
abortion?
