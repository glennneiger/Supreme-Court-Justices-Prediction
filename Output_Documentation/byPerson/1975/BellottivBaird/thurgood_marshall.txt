that
goes
to
the
fact
that
even
if
the
girl
is
living
away
from
home
or
the
other
side
of
town
and
has
not
seen
her
parents
for
the
last
three
years?
justice

marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
(inaudible)
that
we
want
to
keep
the
family
together?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
applies
to
all
whether
they
are
together
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
know
what
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
might
set
up
as
rules,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
made
no
effort
to
find
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
not
get
the
material
because
you
ran
in
favor
of
the
court
before
they
even
get
the
chance
to
look
at
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
how
do
we
know
what
will
be
done
in
the
state
court?
we
do
not
know
and
you
do
not
know,
and
nobody
knows.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
know
what
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
speaks,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
fact
the
state
did
ask
the
court
to
abstain?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
did
not
and
they
did
not
give
any
reason
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
would
say
that
this
statute
required
that
the
judge
get
the
best
medical
assistance
that
he
can
get
and
the
best
medical
adviser
he
can
get
and
that
it
be
expeditiously
held
within
24
hours.
that
would
take
you
at
that
point,
would
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
saying
that
some
18-year-olds,
17-year-olds,
and
no
more
than
21-year-olds,
if
sol
why
cannot
they
get
married
without
consent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
see
any
difference
in
the
state
is
interest
on
this
point,
when
you
say
that
12-year-old
got
more
sense
than
some
17-year-old.
what
you
mean
is
some
exceptionally
intelligent
12-year-olds
have
more
sense
than
some
stupid
17-year-old,
you
do
not
know
the
average?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
good
is
it
to
your
argument?
