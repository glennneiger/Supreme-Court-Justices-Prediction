do

in

a

suppose
a

13-year-old

inherited
very
substantial

jammed

accept
the

pay
anything

it,
from
a
12-year-old

you

the
right
of
a
12-year-old

13-year-old
girl
to
give
away
a
home
worth
$500,000.00

the

you
have,
at

for
me
satisfied
me
that
the

not
give,
looking
at

whole

twenty-five
reasons
could
occur
to
me
in
less
than
not
many
seconds
on
why
a
girl
who
has
already
made
in
all
these
briefs
a
strong
case
and
i
think
accurately
that
this
is
a
period
of
great
stress.
she
is
afraid
to
tell
her
parents.
it
is
also
certainly
so
that
i
can
take
it
as
a
common
knowledge
that
frequently
adolescent
people
feel
that
way,
but
when
they
do
in
fact
consult
their
parents,
they
find
much
more
rapport
than
they
anticipated?
chief
justice
warren
e.

how
you
can
you
generalize
as
you
were
saying
that
the
court
could
decide
in
talking
with
her?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
in
fact
her
parents
were
likely
to
consent?
chief
justice
warren
e.

is
that
not
the
business
of
the
courts
to
find
out
before
they
bring
them
out
on
this
stage
of
litigation?
chief
justice
warren

as
i
understand,
these
other
parties
have
not

resolved
of

the
finality?
