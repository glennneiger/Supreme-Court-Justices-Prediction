mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-73,
bellotti,
the
attorney
general
of
massachusetts
against
baird
and
75-109,
hunerwadel
against
baird.
mr.
rosenfeld
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
order
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
the
majority
of
that
court
enjoined
the
defendants
from
enforcing
mass
general
law's
chapter
112,
section
12p
and
related
sections.
the
majority
also
declared
that
section
12p
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
this
statute
was
originally
enacted
on
august
2,
1974
and
it
provides
that
before
an
unmarried
minor
in
this
case,
a
child
under
18,
may
obtain
an
abortion,
the
physician
involved
must
obtain
both
her
consent
and
the
consent
of
her
parents.
importantly,
if
either
parent
refuses,
a
state
court
judge
is
explicitly
authorized
by
the
statute
to
give
his
consent
for
good
cause
shown.
the
action
is
brought
by
the
plaintiffs
on
october
30,
1974,
the
day
before
section
12p
was
to
go
into
effect
and
the
principal
plaintiffs
were
gerald
zupnick,
a
physician
performing
abortions
and
two
pregnant
minors
who
were
seeking
abortions
without
the
knowledge
of
their
parents.
a
single
judge
entered
a
temporary
order
restraining
the
enforcement
of
12p
and
convened
a
three-judge
court
and
subsequently
granted
intervention
to
parents
of
unmarried
minor
daughters
in
massachusetts
and
those
intervenors
are
represented
today
by
mr.
brian
riley
whose
argument
will
follow
mine.
the
three-judge
court
after
four
days
of
hearings
issued
its
opinion
on
april
28,
1975
and
the
majority
found
the
section
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
invaded
fundamental
privacy
interest
of
minors.
the
court
acknowledged
that
all
the
experts
both
the
plaintiff’s
experts
and
the
defendant’s
experts
believed
that
parental
involvement
was
very
important
and
helpful
to
the
child
at
this
crucial
time.
the
court,
however,
construed
the
statute
on
its
own
and
found
that
in
its
view,
the
statute
created
parental
rights
that
were
independent
of
the
interest
of
the
child.
therefore,
asserted
the
court,
parents
would
be
authorized
under
the
statute
to
refuse
consent
in
order
to
punish
the
child
or
for
other
misguided
reasons.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
in
fact
had
never
been
allowed
to
go
into
effect
and
no
case
had
therefore
come
up
to
the
state
court.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
yes,
it
was
asked
to
abstain,
your
honor,
and
it
decided
that
such
abstention
was
unnecessary
without
giving
reasons.
therefore,
it
will
be
argued
that
a
quite
apart
from
abstention,
the
existence
of
the
judicial
review
provision
provides
the
opportunity
for
a
narrowing
construction
in
the
state
court,
and
therefore,
justifies
a
finding
that
at
least
on
its
face,
the
statute
is
not
invalid
because
of
this
opportunity
for
a
narrowing
construction.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
i
am
suggesting
that
there
were
alternatives,
your
honor.
it
could
have
abstained,
but
even
if
it
decided
that
this
was
the
kind
of
case,
it
should
decide
on
the
merits
since
the
only
attack
was
a
facial
attack.
the
existence
of
a
good
cause
provision
for
the
state
court
to
grant
consent
was
sufficient
basis
for
finding
that
at
least
on
its
face,
the
statute
was
valid
because
a
state
court
utilizing
common
law
principles
well
established
in
massachusetts
might
narrow
the
statute
to
come
within
constitutional
limits.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
that
is
right,
your
honor.
on
this
very
point,
the
district
court
found
that
the
provision
in
the
statute
for
consent
to
the
abortion
by
a
state
court
judge
would
not
protect
the
child’s
privacy
interest
because,
again,
in
a
district
court’s
view,
it
was
part
of
a
statute
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
parents
and
not
for
children.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
that
would
be
consent,
and
that
therefore,
the
abortions
--
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
not
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
because
on
the
statute
requires
that
the
physician
obtain
a
consent
of
both
the
minor
and
their
parents.
so,
it
contemplates
that
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
the
judgment
of
the
child
will
be
taken
into
account,
but
in
addition,
the
judgment
of
the
parents
will
also
be
given
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
a
decision
for
the
minor’s
abortion.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
provisions
and
in
fact,
they
are
set
out
in
the
dissent
to
district
court's
opinion
in
a
footnote.
they
deal
in
areas
of
adoption
and
various
kinds
of
licenses
on
the
consent
of
parents
is
required.
specifically,
your
honor,
as
an
example,
no
child
--
in
the
adoption
of
a
minor
child
the
consent
of
both
that
minor
child
and
the
natural
parents
is
required
before
the
adoption
can
be
approved
by
a
state
court.
final
point,
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
district
court’s
opinion
is
that
the
district
court
found
that
parental
consent
was
unnecessary
because
in
the
court’s
own
words,
a
substantial
number
of
minor
females
on
their
own
were
capable
of
informed
consent
about
whether
or
not
to
have
an
abortion.
today
in
our
argument,
the
state
will
focus
briefly
on
three
issues.
first,
the
rights
and
interests
of
parents
and
child
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
section
12p.
second,
the
state's
interest
in
enacting
12p
and
finally
the
important
role
that
the
statute
gives
to
the
state
court
to
authorize
the
consent
or
to
authorize
an
abortion
for
good
cause
shown
where
individual
circumstances
so
suggest.
state’s
view
of
the
daughter’s
rights
and
the
parent’s
interests
are
decidedly
different
from
either
the
plaintiff’s
or
the
intervenor’s
or
the
district
court.
with
regards
to
parents,
contrary
to
the
district
court
and
to
intervenors,
the
state
does
not
believe
that
this
statute
or
any
other
source
in
law
gives
parents
the
right
to
refuse
consent
for
reason
other
than
the
child’s
wellbeing.
we
do
believe
that
parents
have
an
interest,
the
interest
in
assessing
what
will
best
serve
the
child’s
needs.
parent's
interest
we
believe
is
a
derivative
one
and
is
entirely
a
function
of
their
greater
relative
capacity
for
judgment.
thus,
we
believe
it
was
wrong
for
the
district
court
to
separate
out
and
exalt
what
it
labeled
as
parental
rights.
with
regard
to
minors,
we
believe
that
minors
have
a
constitutionally
protected
interest
in
privacy
and
it
includes
the
abortion
decision.
however;
in
legislation
affecting
minors,
the
state
may
take
account
of
differences
in
capacity
between
minors
and
adults
and
enact
broader
legislation
for
minors.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
state’s
position
that
adults
and
children
both
have
rights
of
privacy
protected
by
the
constitution,
but
the
state
may
pursue
different
and
important
interests
when
legislating
specifically
for
minors.
turning
to
the
interests
of
the
state
which
justified
the
requirement
of
parental
consent,
they
are
as
follows.
first,
the
statute
seeks
to
support
the
role
of
the
family
in
a
situation
where
the
need
for
family
and
family
support
is
plainly
called
into
play.
it
assumes
not
the
parents
will
be
punitive,
but
they
will
be
supportive
and
assisted.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
your
honor,
in
massachusetts
--
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
no,
the
statute
will
not,
your
honor,
because
of
the
provision
for
consent
by
a
state
court
for
good
cause
shown.
we
believe
that
the
common
law
principle
of
the
freedom
emancipation
of
the
minor
would
be
a
factor.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
where
it
is
together
or?
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
it
applies
in
the
first
instance
to
all,
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
right.
we
believe
that
nothing
in
the
record
establishes
the
contrary
proposition
to
the
fact
that
parents
will
be
supportive
where
the
family
unit
exists.
the
second
--
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
that
is
quite
right,
your
honor,
she
was
residing
with
her
parents.
the
second
state
interest
is
its
health
and
welfare
interest,
ensuring
participation
and
decisions
about
a
minor’s
abortion
by
those
who
know
best
her
medical
and
emotional
history.
it
is
an
effort
to
guarantee
that
this
history
will
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
abortion
decision.
some
parents
may
object
not
to
the
abortion
itself,
but
to
the
conditions
under
which
it
is
performed.
for
example,
taking
from
the
record,
there
maybe
instances
and
indeed
are
instances
where
abortions
are
performed
on
minors
with
little
or
no
counseling
or
where
that
counseling
goes
on,
it
goes
on
in
groups
with
no
opportunity
for
individual
understanding
of
the
plight
of
the
particular
minor.
often,
it
may
happen,
and
does
happen
that
physicians
will
perform
abortions
with
no
prior
knowledge
of
the
child
and
possibly
an
inadequate
knowledge
of
her
prior
medical
or
emotional
history.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
usually.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
your
honor,
in
all
cases,
there
is
as
the
record
shows,
an
hour
of
prior
conversation
with
adults
and
minors
mixed
together
and
often
in
groups.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
not
with
the
physician.
although
the
record
suggests
that
on
occasion
the
physician
may
participate
to
some
degree,
but
the
usual
situation
is
that
the
physician
sees
the
child
for
the
first
time
when
she
comes
into
actually
to
have
the
surgery
done.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
right.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
that
is
one
method,
your
honor,
assuming
that
the
patient
would
be
in
the
position
to
be
able
to
appreciate
and
make
a
judgment
with
regard
to
the
abortion
decision
and
as
we
say,
this
interest
is
one
of
a
number
of
interests
that
we
think
that
the
state
is
pursuing
in
enacting
section
12p.
we
believe
that
the
parents
might
fairly
condition
an
abortion
on
having
that
abortion
done
not
under
the
circumstances
that
i
have
just
described,
but
under
the
circumstances
that
exist
and
are
available
in
the
city
of
boston,
for
example,
at
the
beth
israel
hospital,
as
is
reflected
in
the
record.
we
believe
that
the
health
and
welfare
interest
of
the
state
here
goes
beyond
its
support
of
the
family
unit.
this
interest,
i
am
now
speaking
of,
is
usually
characterized
as
parent’s
patriarch.
it
is
the
state's
own
independent
concern
for
protecting
the
minor.
now,
the
state
recognizes
that
neither
this
concern
nor
its
concern
for
family
would
justify
an
outright
prohibition
of
abortion
as
was
the
case
with
the
texas
statute
in
roe
v.
wade
such
as
--
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
it
does,
your
honor
that
is
a
difference.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
well,
we
disagree
that
the
veto
power
is
absolute,
but
both
parents
do
have
the
power
over
the
consent,
the
criteria
of
consent.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
no,
your
honor.
if
they
were
separated,
but
not
divorced,
the
statute
is
unclear
as
to
what
the
situation
would
be
in
that
instance,
but
the
statute
may
explain
that
where
required
in
appropriate
circumstances,
one
guardian,
if
you
will,
will
do.
and
again,
the
underscore
the
importance
of
the
state
court
could
cause
provision
to
deal
with
the
individual
circumstances
such
as
you
have
suggested.
we
feel
that
in
this
area,
individual
circumstances
are
the
norm
and
not
the
exception
and
that
a
statute
must
take
account
of
that.
any
statute
must
take
account
of
that
by
giving
some
flexibility
and
an
opportunity
for
a
construction
consistent
with
the
constitution,
the
state’s
interest,
and
the
interest
of
the
child.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
i
am
saying
that
on
its
face,
the
consent
of
both
would
be
necessary
because
you
have
used
the
word
separated
rather
than
divorced.
but
i
believe
that
if
the
separation
were,
if
you
will,
a
divorce
in
fact,
this
certainly
would
be,
i
believe
it
would
be
sufficient
given
the
statute
for
the
consent
of
one
parent
to
suffice
any
provision
for
state
court
involvement
is
there
on
the
face
of
the
section
12p.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
yes,
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
well,
it
certainly
does
not
fit
the
word
deserted
on
its
face
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
statute
as
written
would
guarantee
that
the
consent
of
only
one
parent
would
suffice
in
that
instance.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
legislature
in
enacting
any
statute
can
only
deal
specifically
with
so
many
situations
and
the
responsibility
beyond
that
is
to
provide
a
process
whereby
additional
individual
circumstances
can
be
dealt
with
to
avoid
the
rigidity
and
over
breadth
that
would
otherwise
be
the
case.
it
is
important
in
our
view
to
know,
your
honor,
that
this
is
the
only
statute
of
all
the
parental
consent
provisions
dealt
with
by
lower
courts
that
provides
explicitly
for
the
involvement
of
a
state
court
and
provides
that
the
state
court
quite
apart
from
what
the
parents
have
done,
may
provide
the
consent
and
i
want
to
turn
now,
your
honor,
to
that
judicial
review
provision.
we
believe
that
in
the
end,
the
state
recognizes
that
there
has
to
be
a
process
to
focus
directly
on
the
child’s
interest
and
privacy
and
by
giving
a
state
court
a
role,
the
state
believes
that
section
12p
provides
the
kind
of
flexibility
and
satisfies
this
need
to
take
account
of
individual
circumstances.
there
are
specifically
two
common
law
principles
that
the
state
court
is
likely
to
use
in
applying
12p's
good
cause
standard.
first
is
to
mature
minor
role.
it
is
a
well-established
common
law
rule
in
massachusetts
that
when
the
minor
shows
a
capacity
for
informed
judgment,
the
rationale
for
parental
consent
ceases
and
the
court
should
authorize
an
abortion.
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
with
this
common
law
rule,
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
conclusive
or
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
statute
sets
up.
it
is
a
irrebuttable
presumption
and
the
process
is
provided
where
by
that
presumption
can
be
rebutted.
the
second
common
law
principle
is
the
court’s
independent
responsibility
to
act
in
the
child’s
best
interest.
even
if
the
mature,
minor
rule
does
not
apply,
the
common
law
compels
in
massachusetts
that
the
consent
be
given.
if
the
court
making
its
own
independent
assessment
finds
that
abortion
would
be
in
the
child’s
best
interest.
we
believe
in
light
of
these
principles
that
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
statute
will
be
applied
faithful
to
the
constitution.
the
state
submits
that
it
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
exercise
its
police
power
within
these
self-imposed
limits.
for
these
--
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
the
statute
does
not
speak
specifically
to
those
items.
it
does
suggest
that
no
guardian
ad
litem
need
to
be
appointed,
and
for
the
pregnant
minor
to
have
the
process
that
the
statute
provides.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
yes,
we
would,
your
honor.
we
speak
to
this
in
our
briefs.
specifically
we
believe
that
since
the
statute
says
that
common
law
rights
are
preserved
and
since
the
common
law
provides
this
opportunity
for
the
minor
child
in
consent
situations
that
the
minor
could
attempt
to
go
into
court
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
court
as
part
of
its
good
cause
decision
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
parents
need
to
be
consulted
in
the
first
instance.
and
of
course,
there
is
also
a
provision
for
anonymity
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
well
only,
your
honor,
only
if
a
state
court
judge
familiar
with
these
kinds
of
cases,
were
to
exercise
his
judgment
in
that
regard,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
any
general
rule,
any
inflexible
rule
can
be
stated
that
would
dictate
an
outcome
in
one
direction
or
the
other.
what
i
do
believe
is
that
the
difficulty
of
these
questions
does
not
compel
a
conclusion
that
the
state
has
no
role
in
the
area
of
protecting
minors,
and
protecting
the
minors’
best
interest,
and
we
believe
that
is
what
the
state
has
done
in
this
statute.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
no,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
what
i
suggest
is,
if
a
child
went
into
state
court
saying
that
in
this
instance,
the
individual
circumstances
were
such
that
it
would
be
damaging
to
notify
the
parents
because
of
some
individual
circumstance,
the
state
court
would
have
to
decide.
the
first,
the
threshold
question
it
would
have
to
decide
before
deciding
whether
or
not
to
consent
of
the
abortion,
it
would
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
parents
should
be
notified,
and
whether
or
not
the
hearing
should
be
held.
we
believe
that
the
statute
must
say
suggest
that
in
most
instances,
the
parents
should
be
notified.
indeed
that
is
the
policy
of
the
statute.
i
am
saying
there
maybe
that
rare
occasion,
where
it
would
be
the
state
court
judge
might
decide
it
is
unnecessary,
or
in
fact
harmful
to
inform
the
parents,
and
in
that
case,
the
state
court
might
proceed
to
the
next
question,
that
is
whether
or
not
to
grant
its
consent
to
the
child’s
abortion.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
well,
your
honor,
this
statute
we
believe
quantifies
the
common
law.
we
believe,
for
example,
that
the
two
parent
requirement
is
one
of
long
existence
in
massachusetts.
we
believe
it
is
a
quantification.
it
is
a
subsequent
--
excuse
me?
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
it
does
not,
but
i
have
an
additional
point,
your
honor.
of
course
it
provides
for
a
fine,
a
criminal
fine,
and
there
was
no
provision
for
a
fine
and
common
law
does
not
provide
for
any
jail
sentence
i
might
add.
one
additional
point,
if
i
may
your
honor,
there
was
a
statute
passed
in
the
last
six
months
which
deals
with
the
consent.
it
is
raised
in
the
plaintiff’s
supreme
court
--
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
it
does
change
the
common
law.
mr.
s.
stephen
rosenfeld
it
does,
your
honor.
i
frankly,
i
think
the
record
is
inadequate
to
deal
with
that
statute
here
and
i
think
the
statute
that
has
been
passed
is
an
ambiguous
one,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
should
deal
with
the
constitutionality
of
one
statute
at
a
time.
thank
you
very
much.
