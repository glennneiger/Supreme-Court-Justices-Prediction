mr.
roy
lucas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
three-judge
court
below
and
many
other
courts
facing
these
issues
across
the
united
states
have
viewed
these
issues
in
a
fundamentally
different
way
from
that
suggested
by
the
commonwealth
and
by
the
intervenors.
it
is
generally
been
presumed
that
statutes
of
these
kind
mean
what
they
say.
namely,
that
in
the
first
instance,
one
or
both
parents
have
a
right
to
veto
the
exercise
of
access
to
abortion
on
behalf
of
a
minor,
regardless
of
the
health
condition
or
the
circumstances
of
the
minor.
the
statutes
on
their
face
and
as
they
are
written
expressly
place
a
medical
decision
in
the
unfettered
discretion
of
two
persons
other
than
the
patient
and
persons
other
than
the
physician.
it
is
not
even
an
expressed
exception
in
this
statute
to
protect
the
life
of
the
young
woman,
or
to
protect
the
health
of
the
young
woman.
there
is
not
even
any
mention
of
her
health
solely
that
of
the
power
of
the
parents
to
veto
and
consent
and
indeed
there
is
no
exception
made
in
the
statute
in
the
case
of
rape
or
statutory
rape,
and
nowhere
is
there
any
mention
of
the
possibility
of
the
physician’s
judgment
in
an
exceptional
case
allowing
an
abortion
that
--
mr.
roy
lucas
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
one
potential
exception
but
it
is
totally
undefined
and
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
circumstances
in
which
there
could
be
good
cause
according
to
the
patient
but
not
according
to
the
superior
court.
the
problem
with
the
good
cause
clause
is
that
it
in
effect
sets
up
an
obstacle
course
which
is
designed
to
defeat
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right
by
a
minor.
there
is
no
other
statute
in
the
commonwealth
which
requires
a
person
to
go
to
court,
to
be
able
to
exercise
a
fundamental
right.
it
is
our
position
that
the
good
cause
clause
is
even
worse
than
the
multiple
physician
consultation
requirement
in
doe
versus
bolton.
it
is
even
worse
than
the
requirement
of
hospital
committing
in
doe
versus
bolton.
at
least
those
requirements
had
physicians
reviewing
the
matter.
here
you
have
parents
and
you
have
the
superior
court
judge
without
any
provision
whatsoever
for
example
for
an
expedited
hearing.
there
is
no
provision
for
the
patient
having
access
to
legal
counsel
and
they
--
mr.
roy
lucas
we
are
suggesting
that,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
well,
in
view
of
the
statute,
the
statute
could
have
provided
for
an
expedited
cause,
and
provided
--
mr.
roy
lucas
no,
i
am
not.
there
is
no
provision
on
one
way
or
another
and
--
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
true.
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
the
minor
could
obtain
some
relief
immediately
in
state
court,
but--
mr.
roy
lucas
we
have
no
idea
what
they
might
do?
mr.
roy
lucas
well,
we
have
certainly
ascertained
that
there
is
no
law
on
this
subject
because
the
statute
was
enjoined.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
correct,
we
did
and
--
mr.
roy
lucas
our
position
would
be
--
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
correct
and
the
state
has
not
suggested
any
reasonable
ways
in
which
it
would
be
likely
under
traditional
abstention
principles
enunciated
by
the
courts.
mr.
roy
lucas
the
state
asked
the
court
to
abstain,
yes
and
the
court
refused
to.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
true.
they
regarded
the
good
cause
clause
as
something
which
was
not
substantial
enough
to
justify
extended
discussion
and
---
mr.
roy
lucas
we
would
still
assert
that
the
minor
cannot
be
burdened
with
being
required
to
be
in
the
court.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
do
not
know
in
massachusetts
law.
i
would
presume
that
there
would
be
an
expedited
tro
here.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
true.
i
can
imagine
the
judge
granting
on
ex
part
temporary
restraining
order
without
notice
to
the
parents
here
and
it
has
been
our
position
consistently
that
requiring
the
patient
to
even
notify
the
parents
could
be
seriously
disrupted
with
the
patient’s
life
and
disrupted
with
the
family
to
the
extent
that
a
notification
requirement
would
be
something
we
would
be
opposed
to.
and
in
particular,
the
abstention
cases
on
this
court
have
tended
to
indicate
that
there
should
be
some
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
a
state
court
construction
would
avoid
the
constitutional
questions
and
we
do
not
believe
--
mr.
roy
lucas
we
would
that
on
the
grounds
that
that
was
primarily
economic
and
social
welfare
legislation
under
the
distinction
the
court
adopted
in
dandridge
v.
williamson
and
cases
as
i
mentioned.
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
we
would
think
that
--
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
we
would
think
that
is
true.
there
is
certainly
no
emergency
in
the
property
area
either
and
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
here
that
delay
could
cause
the
possibility
of
minors
seeking
out
illegal
non-medical
abortions
and
that
would
be
one
of
the
main
problems
and
the
delay
here
could
take
the
minor
over
in
to
the
2nd
trimester
of
pregnancy
where
the
procedure
would
be
more
complicated
and
more
difficult.
mr.
roy
lucas
even
if
they
did.
even
if
we
assumed
that
the
state
courts
could
reach
the
issue
within
one
week
or
two,
there
would
be
some
medical
cases
where
that
would
be
hazardous
and
on
top
of
that,
the
state
court
has
no
guidelines
whatsoever
in
which
to
know
what
factors
to
look
into.
that
is
our
chief
problem
with
it
is
that
the
roe
v.
wade
indicated.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
true
but
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
guidance
whatsoever
for
what
practice
they
should
take
into
account.
that
is
the
principal
problem
with
the
good
cause.
mr.
roy
lucas
it
could
have
gone
some
of
the
distance,
yes
it
could
have.
there
are
so
many
different
types
of
problems
that
could
come
up.
there,
we
could
enumerate
--
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
we
will
disagree
with
that
strongly
because
the
state
court
would
have
to
litigate.
the
burden
that
they
put
on
the
courts
to
take
into
account
all
the
different
ages,
all
the
different
health
conditions,
the
rape
situation,
the
incest
situation,
the
different
reasons
the
parents
might
have
on
withholding
consent
would
impose
a
tremendous
burden
on
the
state
courts
if
not
on
the
federal
courts
some
people
would
go
in
to
1983
actions.
mr.
roy
lucas
presumably,
they
were
yes.
but,
presumably
certainly,
there
is
no
indication
what
legislative
motive
would
have
been
which
is
not
relevant
here,
but
the
effect
and
the
impact
of
the
statute
is
to
put
a
tremendous
burden
on
the
minor,
a
tremendous
burden
that
the
minor
would
not
have
in
any
other
circumstance.
one
of
the
equal
protection
issues
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
new
statute
was
passed
last
summer
allows
a
pregnant
minor
to
consent
to
any
other
procedure
except
abortion
or
sterilization.
and,
if
the
state
interest
is
so
strong
in
the
abortion
area,
then
why
are
they
not
strong
for
any
other
form
of
treatment.
a
minor
can
consent
to
all
forms
of
prenatal
care
and
surgery
under
that
statute.
the
minor
could
consent
even
to
a
major
operation
such
as
a
cesarean
section
under
the
new
statute
without
having
to
go
to
court.
the
minor
has
to
go
to
court
for
no
other
type
of
procedure
which
is
accepted
under
the
medical
right
statute
that
was
passed
last
summer.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
would
not
--
if
her
parents
had
consented,
i
would
think
that
she
had
no
standing.
mr.
roy
lucas
well,
our
position
was
not
that
the
disclosure
of
the
patient’s
name
and
bringing
the
parents
into
the
case
would
have
been
unnecessary
because
of
other
parties
withstanding
in
the
case
and
it
would
have
been
destructive
and
damaging
to
the
patient.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
true.
she
would
not
have
been
hurt
by
the
statute
at
all.
mr.
roy
lucas
if
her
parents
had
been
willing
to
consent
then
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
her
to
become
involved
in
the
litigation
and
to
have
taken
such
care
to
avoid
exposure
of
her
name.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
would
be
true
ordinarily
but
in
this
case
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
essential.
in
this
case
a
three-judge
court
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
observe
her
demeanor
and
question
her
in
camera
for
at
least
probably
a
two-hour
hearing
that
we
had
and
it
would
be
against
the
common
sense
to
think
that
there
would
be
any
reason
why
she
would
lie
about
that.
why
she
would
say
her
parents
--?
mr.
roy
lucas
in
many
cases
that
would
be
true.
we
have
a
great
deal
--
mr.
roy
lucas
perhaps
--
mr.
roy
lucas
perhaps
i
misunderstood
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
the
question.
i
thought
this
question
was
whether
the
parents
may
have
in
fact
already
consented
and
if
the
parents
had
already
consented
or
would
have
been
willing
to
consent
--
mr.
roy
lucas
we
certainly
do
not,
we
do
not
know
that.
we
--
mr.
roy
lucas
well,
with
other
parties
who
had
standing
in
the
litigation
it
was
not
really
necessary.
i
think
the
district
court
determined
that
her
right
not
to
have
her
parents
notified
was
of
sufficient
privacy
and
constitutional
dimension
to
justify
the
limited
inquiry
in
her
particular
case.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
true.
the
physician
in
particular,
we
feel
that
his
standing
was
recognized
in
roe
v.
bolton
and
that
would
be
clear
on
that
particular
issue
and
the
court
did
make
a
rule
allowing
intervenors
to
participate
in
the
case.
the
intervenors
extensively
represented
the
parents
of
minors
who
could
become
pregnant,
who
might
become
pregnant
and
want
to
obtain
abortions
in
massachusetts.
so
there
were
two
sets
of
attorneys
on
the
other
side
to
protect
any
possible
interest.
i
do
not
see
how
another
third
set
of
attorneys
for
the
parents
could
have
affected
the
presentation
of
the
litigation
or
the
outcome
in
view
of
the
standing
of
the
other
parties.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
true
and
also
the
court
addressed
the
case
in
terms
of
the
statute
on
its
face
rather
than
as
applied
to
this
particular
minor
and
the
court
made
an
express
determination
that
this
minor
was
fully
confident
to
bring
the
action
and
that
she
was
confident
to
give
an
informed
consent
and
that
was
another
reason
for
dispensing
with
notifying
her
parents.
mr.
roy
lucas
she
was
16.
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
certainly
true.
we
had
a
great
deal
of
testimony
concerning
the
problem
of
12,
13,
14-year-olds
and
the
testimony
from
dr.
jane
hudson
and
dr.
carol
natalson
indicated
that
certainly
maturity
decreases
with
age,
but
there
would
be
instances
where
some
12,
13,
and
14-year-olds
could
give
an
informed
consent
equal
to
or
better
than
that
of
a
18
or
19-year-old,
that
it
was
an
individualized
case
and
this
where
the
opinion
in
roe
v.
wade
expressing
the
need
for
physician’s
discretion
comes
in
very
strongly
that
a
physician
and
the
counselor
in
the
facility
would
have
to
more
carefully
talk
with
and
more
carefully
obtain
a
consent
from
a
minor
who
was
13
or
14
in
order
to
make
sure
that
this
minor
had
a
full
understanding.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
lucas
thank
you,
your
honor.
early
in
the
day
the
question
was
raised
whether
they
were
pending
any
malpractice
battery
cases
on
the
subject
of
abortion
for
minors
and
we
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
foot
note
5
of
the
motion
to
affirm
and
brief
filed
by
the
appellees
in
this
case
which
cites
a
case
pending
in
vermont.
it
is
the
only
we
know
of.
we
have
looked
to
see
if
there
are
any
others.
the
case
was
pending
in
the
superior
court
and
it
is
being
certified
at
the
supreme
court
of
vermont
for
argument
being
may
by
mutual
stipulation
of
the
party
since
--
mr.
roy
lucas
on
foot
note
5
on
page
4
of
the
green
pamphlet,
bogart
versus
vermont
women’s
health
center.
vermont
has
no
statute
requiring
parental
consent.
in
this
case,
the
uncontested
stipulation
shows
that
the
minor
changed
her
mind
after
her
parents
found
out
about
her
having
an
abortion
and
that
the
parents
have
sued
for
battery.
when
we
were
discussing
the
abstention
doctrine,
the
appellees
were
particularly
concerned
with
the
cases
of
lake
carrie’s
association
and
harris
county
commissioners,
the
latter
being
from
the
last
term
and
we
would
refer
the
court
to
the
language
in
lake
carrie
as
about
abstention
being
invoked
only
in
very
special
circumstances
which
justified
the
delay
and
the
expense
and
to
harris
county
which
indicated
that
if
the
state
courts
would
be
likely
to
construe
the
statute
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
it
has
been
our
feeling
that
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
state
courts
would
be
able
to
resolve
the
constitutional
questions
in
this
particular
instance.
the
idea
of
a
14,
or
15,
or
16-year-old
being
able
to
make
her
way
to
through
maze
of
state
or
federal
courts
is
particular
with
her
parents
on
the
other
side
and
not
even
being
able
to
have
access
to
legal
services
representations
as
the
federal
legal
services
corporation
act
bans
the
use
of
those
funds
in
representing
anyone
to
help
obtain
an
abortion.
i
think
from
a
very
practical
standpoint,
it
would
be
an
insuperable
burden
for
most
minors
and
a
burden
which
is
not
imposed
on
any
other
form
of
medical
care
or
any
other
constitutional
right.
there
were
four
days
of
testimony
in
this
case
in
an
effort
to
sift
out
with
numerous
experts
the
underlying
factual
issues
which
are
so
sensitive
and
so
important
in
the
case.
mary
moe
testified
in
camara
before
the
three-judge
federal
court.
they
made
an
expressed
finding
that
she
had
made
a
considered
decision
to
have
an
abortion.
she
has
had
two
hours
of
counseling
from
the
registered
nurse
at
the
clinic.
she
had
received
materials
from
the
county
health
clinic
perhaps
over
40
days
before.
there
was
a
period
in
the
record
of
43
days
which
passed
before
her
pregnancy
test
could
be
positive
before
it
could
be
determined
in
which
she
had
an
opportunity
to
give
thought
and
give
consideration
to
the
subject.
the
intervenors
had
a
child
psychiatrist
sit
in
on
her
testimony
and
that
this
is
perhaps
significant
that
the
child’s
psychiatrist,
when
he
testified
at
the
trial
did
not
in
even
one
sentence
questioned
her
confidence
and
her
ability
to
consent
to
the
procedure.
mr.
roy
lucas
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
she
would,
unless
in
a
very
rare
set
of
circumstances.
i
think
the
physician
would
have
an
obligation
to
refer
her
somewhere
else
if
possible
and
if
that
place
was
known
and
he
may
be
liable
for
not
referring,
but
the
physician
has
his
own
individual
rights.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
think
the
doctor
could
do
that
and
i
think
some
doctors
do
and
some
doctors
will.
even
in
jurisdictions
where
the
question
is
up
in
the
air,
i
think
that
has
often
been
the
case
and
in
many
hospitals
that
has
often
been
the
case.
i
think
that
great
many
people
are
waiting
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
from
the
court
because
of
the
very
important
problems
that
have
come
up
with
teenagers
wanting
access
to
abortion
and
access
to
contraception
and
physicians
being
concerned
as
to
whether
they
can
legally
without
risk
of
litigation
provide
them
with
that
equality.
the
issue
of
civil
remedies
is
not
specifically
raised
in
the
case.
i
think
a
great
many
people
will
be
looking
to
this
decision
to
see
whether
a
physician
could
recognize
a
minor’s
constitutional
right
and
perform
an
abortion
on
a
minor
or
provide
a
minor
with
contraceptive
so
they
do
not
have
parental
consent.
it
is
fairly
clear
in
the
federal
family
planning
programs
because
they
provide
that
family
planning
services,
at
least
insofar
as
contraception
is
concerned,
will
be
provided
without
regard
to
age.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
a
very
interesting
question.
i
would
think
that
the
child’s
right
in
this
particular
case
would
not
merely
rise
to
the
statute,
that
the
right
of
access
to
abortion
rises.
the
tattoo
would
be
something
more
of
a
whimsical
nature,
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
a
lot
of
constitutional
protections
extended
to
conduct
which
is
--
mr.
roy
lucas
i
think
that
is
a
really
kind
of
case
that
could
go
either
way.
it
is
a
kind
of
case
that
would
go
depending
on
what
rights
were
eventually
recognized
to
think
such
as
hair
and
personal
appearance
and
i
am
aware
of
your
honor's
position
in
the
seventh
circuit
on
the
hair
question
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
if
the
right
of
personal
appearance
were
recognized
as
a
fundamental
right
then
the
minor
would
be
able
to
do
this
without
parental
consent
and
it
maybe
on
the
other
hand
that
there
is
no
substantial
reason
for
forbidding
her
or
him
to
have
tattoo
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
could
come
up
in
something
very
simple
to
tinker
context.
it
would
be
our
feeling
that
while
the
plaintiffs
in
the
tinker
case
were
on
the
same
side
as
their
parents,
but
the
parents
could
not
have
eradicated
the
impact
of
this
court’s
decision
in
tinker
by
saying
that
they
will
not
consent
to
their
children
engaging
in
those
activities,
particularly
with
the
state
backing
them
up
with
criminal
sanctions.
i
do
not
think
the
school
could
have
said
that
only
those
minors
whose
parents
will
give
them
written
permission
to
demonstrate
and
wear
armbands
will
be
permitted
to
do
so.
i
think
this
would
apply
in
the
emery
gold
(ph)
area
too,
that
parents
could
not
conduct
and
control
and
weigh
constitutional
rights
of
a
minor
in
a
juvenile
offender
proceeding.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
think
my
answer
would
be
different
in
a
case
like
that.
the
state
itself
could
theoretically
band
tattooing
if
there
were
evidence
of
hepatitis
outbreaks
and
things
of
that
nature.
if
there
were
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
it
being
harmful
to
the
minors
that
would
be
a
whole
different
story.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
again
gets
in
the
same
area
as
the
personal
appearance
and
the
hair
area.
i
do
not
know
what
the
outcome
of
that
would
be
in
this
court,
but
it
is
a
right
that
it
is
not
as
important
to
minors
as
the
right
of
control
of
their
reproductive
freedom,
their
right
of
access
to
abortion.
it
could
be
things
said
in
this
court’s
opinion
about
the
dangers
--
mr.
roy
lucas
yes
and
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
roy
lucas
i
would
not
be
surprised
of
that.
mr.
roy
lucas
we
are
not.
we
clearly
feel
that
the
consent
of
one
parent
is
just
as
unconstitutional
as
requiring
the
consent
of
both.
that
with
both,
you
have
the
problem
of
arbitrary
reasons,
or
no
reasons,
or
unreasonable
reasons
from
two
different
people.
it
causes
more
delay.
mr.
roy
lucas
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
your
honor
that
is
true.
mr.
roy
lucas
i
do
not
think
it
would.
i
would
agree
precisely
with
what
mr.
susman
said
that
this
right
is
a
more
important
and
more
fundamental
lasting
right
and
that
the
state
interest
in
preventing
your
marriages
are
much
more
compelling.
in
fact,
the
the
other
side,
here
i
do
not
think
the
state
has
any
substantial
interest
in
preventing
a
minor
from
having
access
to
an
abortion
when
she
can
give
an
informed
consent
and
there
is
no
danger
of
medical
problems,
but
the
state
can
offer
a
lot
of
compelling
reasons
for
postponing
the
age
of
marriage
and
it
is
just
a
brief
postponement,
a
thing
would
apply
to
the
right
to
vote,
i
think.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
would
not
be
--
mr.
roy
lucas
yes,
justice
powell.
we
realize
that
is
one
that
has
been
offered,
but
we
do
not
think
that,
that
interest
independently
would
support
the
restriction
on
the
right
to
marry.
that
interest
is
one
of
many
interests
and
that
in
this
particular
case
the
parent’s
interest
does
not
outweigh
the
minor’s
interest.
in
that
case,
the
parent’s
interest
and
a
lot
of
other
interests
outweigh
the
minor’s
interest
in
becoming
married.
there
are
great
many
reasons.
the
impact
on
education
and
the
economic
condition
of
minors
for
getting
married
when
they
are
very
young,
the
high
divorce
rate,
and
a
lot
of
those
factors
which
can
be
used
to
justify
the
age.
we
located
in
the
record
the
testimony
on
the
subject
of
minors
that
were
12,
13,
14,
and
15
and
there
were
statements
from
two
of
very
experienced
experts
to
the
effect
that,
example
dr.
hudson
at
page
79
stated
that
some
12-year-olds
will
be
more
mature
than
18-year-olds
and
at
page
176
dr.
carol
natalson
who
was
a
psychiatrist
in
the
field,
stated
that
one
can
find
a
13-year-old
was
better
able
to
make
good
decision
than
a
17-year-old,
and
dr.
summer
sturgess
who
has
been
active
in
the
adolescent
medicine
field
for
a
long
time,
just
about
at
the
very
outset
of
his
testimony,
that
age
was
simply
was
no
criteria,
no
conclusive
criteria
of
maturity.
mr.
roy
lucas
because
of
the
other
state
interest
that
justifies
drawing
some
line
at
some
point
in
that.
mr.
roy
lucas
that
is
perfectly
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
lucas
it
is
just
to
illustrate
that
if
you
ban
abortions
for
someone
under
age
14,
there
are
going
to
be
a
few
whose
rights
are
very
important
to
them.
they
maybe
members
of
a
class
that
90%
them
cannot
consent,
but
there
is
other
10%
have
important
rights
that
justify
being
recognized
and
it
is
--
mr.
roy
lucas
it
does
come
up
in
the
line
drawing
area
situations
that
we
discussed
in
the
brief.
there
are
just
different
issues
and
different
factors
in
different
cases.
here,
we
are
dealing
with
the
right
that
has
been
recognized
as
fundamental
for
all
persons
in
roe
v.
wade
and
we
are
simply
asserting
that.
mr.
roy
lucas
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
certainly
the
loving
case
and
the
other--
mr.
roy
lucas
we
would
agree
with
that.
the
state
has
much
more
compelling
reasons
for
regulating
in
that
particular
context.
in
massachusetts
for
example
while
the
marriage
is
voidable
for
someone
very
young,
a
marriage
of
a
12-year-old
woman
and
a
14-year-old
young
man
is
not
void
under
statute.
the
18
maybe
the
general
age,
but
if
someone
manages
to
get
married
at
age
12
or
age
14
it
is
valid.
it
is
not
voidable,
but
it
is
not
that
invalid.
there
was
also
some
testimony
as
to
the
practical
issues
in
the
case
of
what
if
a
minor
could
not
obtain
parental
consent
and
we
refer
the
court
to
page
76
of
the
appendix,
one
of
the
witnesses
indicated
that
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
minors
would
be
seeking
illegal
abortions.
i
suppose
minors
that
are
financially
well-off
in
massachusetts
could
cross
over
into
vermont
or
if
vermont
does
not
require
parental
consent
expressly.
referring
to
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
rights
of
minors,
there
is
certain
general
principles
that
we
have
been
able
to
suggest.
there
is
no
case
that
we
have
encountered
which
upholds
the
rights
of
parents
over
the
rights
of
minors
when
both
are
asserting
rights
of
constitutional
dimension
and
i
believe
my
time
is
over.
thank
you,
your
honors.
