mr.
rosenfeld,
does
the
statute
tell
us
anything
about
the
procedure
that
is
to
be
followed
at
such
a
hearing?
for
example,
are
the
parents
of
the
mother
entitled
to
notice
and
to
participate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
construe
the
statute
as
permitting
the
pregnant
minor
to
go
before
the
court
without
giving
notice
to
her
parents?
thereby
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
then
suggesting
that
the
decision
can
be
made
without
the
benefit
of
the
family
history,
which
you
suggest
it
was
a
reason
for
the
parental
consent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
it
is
the
view
of
the
state,
if
i
understand
you
correctly
then
that
the
interest
of
the
pregnant
minorâ€™s
parents
is
insufficient
to
entitle
them
to
notice
in
a
hearing
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lucas,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
that
has
run
through
my
mind
as
i
listened
to
the
argument.
you
suppose
the
statute
would
be
constitutional
that
required
the
consent
of
both
parents
before
a
child
could
obtain
a
tattoo?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(inaudible)
think
for
example
growing
long
hair
is
whimsical
in
nature
that
has
been
given
constitutional
protection,
at
least
in
some
circuits,
i
wonder
if
it
is
right
to
affect
one's
appearance
by
having
some
kind
of
a
special
emblem
on
an
arm
or
something
like
that
might
be
somewhat
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
critical
your
argument
is
the
fact
that
both
parents'
consent
is
required?
you
are
relying
heavily
on
matter
that
you
need
consent
entirely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
consent
requirements
really
change
the
constitutional
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure.
