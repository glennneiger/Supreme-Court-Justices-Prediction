warren
e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1563,
city
of
eastlake
against
forest
city
enterprises.
mr.
andrews.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
this
is
decision
solely
on
ohio
law,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
gave
some
information
in
the
west
virginia
case
a
couple
of
years
ago,
i
think
it
was
'66,
it
is
either
'66
or
'60,
there
was
some
hint
that
that
could
go
so
high
that
it
might
create
constitutional
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
unreasonableness
raise
one
that
mr.
justice
blackmun,
suggested
90%
or
93%
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ginn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
in
the
referendum
aspect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you,
at
least
i
understood
you
to
say
that
they
could
not
change
the
rules
of
the
game
after
you
acquired
the
property
here.
now,
suppose
at
the
time
you
acquired
the
property
a
simple
majority
of
the
city
council
would
resolve
these
issues,
but
the
city
charter
was
amended
after
you
have
acquired
the
property,
provided
that
it
would
take
a
vote
of
three
fourths
of
the
council
to
change
the
zoning,
is
that
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
having
the
city
procedure
amended
by
putting
it
to
a
referendum
and
increasing
the
size
of
the
vote
in
the
council,
what
is
the
fundamental
difference
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
deficiencies
in
hypothesis
just
given
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
hypothesis
before
the
planning
commission?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
answer
is
the
city
council
cannot
do
what
justice
white
has
hypothesized?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
the
normal
processes,
the
normal
process
in
the
city
of
eastlake
is
to
have
go
to
a
referendum?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
--
the
town
here
is
in
massachusetts
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
postulated
to

justice
warren

chief
justice
