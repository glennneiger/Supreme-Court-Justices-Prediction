justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
claim
here
that
the
existing
use
of
the
property,
existing
industrial
zoning
was
an
unreasonable
classification?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
ohio,
what
if
the
city
subjected
rezoning
or
variances
to
referendum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
us
suppose
(inaudible),
what
federal
constitutional
provision
is
implicated
by
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
are,
then
what
provision
does
the
federal
constitution
be
implicated
if
those
decisions
were
subject
to
referendum?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
had
a
provision
under
ohio
statute
that
set
after
a
criminal
defendants
trial
in
the
court
of
common
pleas,
the
verdict
will
then
be
submitted
to
a
referendum
of
the
people
in
that
county
and
if
they
found
him
guilty
even
if
the
jury
and
the
court
of
common
pleas
had
found
him
innocent,
he
would
be
regarded
as
guilty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
can
assume
that
the
city
council
acted
in
the
public
interest,
one
can
assume
that
the
people
who
voted
in
the
referendum
likewise
acted
in
the
public
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
that
the
zoning
that
results
from
the
referendum.
this
referendum
procedure
is
subject
to
the
same
type
of
review,
is
that
that
it
has
simply
been
limited
to
city
council,
that
is
once
it
has
gone
the
referendum,
it
does
not
mean
all
judicial
review
is
foreclosed
of
the
reasonableness
of
this
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
way
it
is
chosen
to
pass
on
application
such
as
yours
to
change
the
zoning
that
existed
on
the
property
at
the
time
you
bought
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
not
object
on
the
grounds
that
once
the
planning
commission
has
decided
to
recommend
the
change,
it
is
unconstitutional
to
submit
it
to
even
a
body
derivative
from
the
sovereignty
of
the
people,
such
as
the
city
council?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
the
way
the
eastlake
ordinance
has
set
up
now
that
the
city
council
only
makes
referendum
recommendations
and
it
is
ultimately
the
people
who
decide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
city
council
in
this
case
had
simply
denied
your
application
for
rezoning
without
any
reasons
or
giving
simply
a
minute
order
denying
it,
would
you
say
that
is
a
procedurally
defective
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
that
the
city
council
is
the
real
decision
maker.
now,
in
our
hypotheses
where
the
city
council
is
the
final
authority
that
is
true,
but
the
people
of
eastlake
have
made
the
people,
a
real
decision
maker?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
extend
that
rule
to
legislation
in
general?
most
western
states
have
a
provision
that
if
the
legislature
passes
a
law,
a
certain
number
of
people
by
petition
can
submit
it
to
referendum
and
if
at
the
next
election,
the
people
disapprove
the
law
it
is
repealed.
is
that
constitutionally
infirm?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
know
that,
but
the
question
is,
in
this
case,
not
whether
your
property
was
going
to
be
rezoned
against
your
will,
but
whether
the
existing
zoning
on
your
property
was
going
to
be
changed
in
accordance
with
your
request?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
is
peculiar
to
zoning
then
this
doctrine
that
you
are
not,
it
does
not
carry
you
over
in
the
other
legislative
function?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
is
true
in
plenty
of
city
council
meetings?
