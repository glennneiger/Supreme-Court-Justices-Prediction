justice

in
accord
with
the
ordinary
referendum
provisions
under
the
town
charter
of
eastlake,
what
if
the
people
in
a
referendum
had
ordained
that
there
would
be
no
change
in
any
of
the
zoning
laws
or
ordinances
of
eastlake
for
five
years?
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
make
a
law
of
general
applicability?
justice
potter
stewart
and
ordinance
enacted
by
referendum,
by
popular
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
the
substantive
zoning,
not
the
substantive
law,
not
a
matter
of
the
procedure
under
which
it
was
enacted
there?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
substance,
not
as
a
matter
of
procedures
by
which
it
was
created
or
ordained
or
acted
upon?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
different
question.
you
have
answered
i
thought
quite
clearly
and
answered
to
other
previous
questions
here
from
the
bench
that
you
are
not
attacking
as
such,
the
unreasonableness
of
this
--
refuse
of
the
result?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question
then?
a
popularly
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
enacted
ordinance
provides,
there
shall
be
no
rezoning
in
eastlake
for
five
years
and
who
change
the
process
on
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
--
procedure,
the
method
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
which
was
it
was
enacted;
it
has
to
do
with
the
substantive
result
underneath
that.
how
about
the
method
and
procedure
by
which
this
hypothetical
ordinance
was
enacted?
would
that
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
conventional
way
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
ordinance
providing
for
this
special
referendum?
what
was
the
convention?
how
would
you
get
the
review
of
--
is
it
either
the
council
action
or
council
action
vetoed
by
the
mayor
that
council
had
failed
to
override?
justice
potter
stewart
common
pleas
court?
justice
potter
stewart
name
me
one.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
still
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
why
could
you
not
go
in
the
county
pleas
court
with
the
same
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
all
you
can
show
by
your
own
case,
not
by
examination
of
your
adversaries,
but
by
your
own
case,
if
this
violates
all
the
standards
of
equity
and
reasonableness
are
outnumbered,
cannot
you?
justice
potter
stewart
common
pleas
court
of
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
that
it
would
be,
if
there
were
this
for
council
action,
that
is
it
would
be
if
these
were
council
action
vetoed
by
the
mayor
and
that
is
what
will
be
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
same
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
under
the
law,
you
can
still
get
a
review
of
that
under
amber,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
have
a
little
different
problem
of
proof
because
you
--
in
council
action,
i
suppose
you
could
call
councilmen
to
the
witness
stand
to
testify
and
you
could
not
call
the
individual
voters
of
ambler,
but
beyond
problem
of
proof,
you
would
have
the
same
kind
of
case,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
is
the
presumption
and
validity
of
what
the
voters
did?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
suppose
so
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
is
an
inequitable
refusal
to
rezone
in
violation
of
the
standard
set
out
in
ambler,
why
could
you
not
seek
review
in
the
county
pleas
court,
the
same
as
you
would
have
been
able
to
do,
had
this
simply
been
council
action?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
you
talk
about
the
variance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
my
brother's
example
might
be
no
more
than
a
variance?
