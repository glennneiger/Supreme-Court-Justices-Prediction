mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
city
of
eastlake
is
located
approximately
15
miles
of
east
of
cleveland
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
it
is
has
about
20,000
people.
it
is
a
city
which
operates
under
a
charter
type
of
government,
which
under
the
ohio
constitution
grants
to
the
city
all
rights
of
local
self
government,
and
it
grants
to
the
people
sovereign
rights
and
so
far,
they
do
not
conflict
with
the
ohio
constitution
or
general
laws.
the
city
of
eastlake
had
adopted
a
general
zoning
plan,
some
25
years
ago,
in
which
the
entire
city
is
zoned
into
various
districts
for
industrial
business
and
residential
use.
the
general
zoning
plan
of
the
city
of
eastlake
did
not
under
attack
in
this
case.
in
may
of
1971,
forest
city
respondent
herein
asked
or
requested
a
rezoning
of
an
eight
acre
parcel
of
land
from
a
limited
industrial
use
to
a
multiple
family
use
for
the
purpose
of
building
multiple
housing.
the
record
does
not
disclose
the
type
of
multiple
housing
rather
it
would
be
very
expensive
apartments
or
the
lower
economic
variety.
at
any
rate,
the
planning
commission
of
the
city
of
eastlake
approved
this
rezoning
request
and
in
the
meantime,
the
voters
by
initiative
petition
had
made
an
amendment
to
the
eastlake
city
charter
requiring
that
before
any
rezoning
of
land
becomes
finally
effective,
it
must
be
submitted
to
a
55%
majority
vote
of
the
people.
now,
the
city
council
then
approved
the
rezoning
request
of
forest
city
and
under
the
eastlake
charter
amendment,
it
was
submitted
for
a
vote
of
the
people
and
failed
to
achieve
or
receive
the
55%
affirmative
vote
necessary
for
its
passage.
forest
city
then
applied
to
the
local
court
of
common
pleas
requesting
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
judgment
asking
that
the
court
declare
the
eastlake
charter
amendment
to
be
unconstitutional
and
the
court
of
common
pleas
affirmed
the
constitutionality
of
the
eastlake
charter
amendment
and
subsequently
in
the
court
of
appeals
–
the
eastlake
charter
amendment
was
affirmed.
and
then,
in
the
ohio
supreme
court,
the
decision
was
reversed
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
found
a
reasonable
use
of
property
by
rezoning
may
not
be
made
dependent
upon
the
potentially,
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
whims
of
the
voting
public
without
violating
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
not
find
the
eastlake
charter
amendment
to
violate
the
ohio
constitution
or
the
general
laws
of
the
state
of
ohio
even
though
this
was
contended
by
the
respondents
throughout.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
mandatory
referendum
voting
procedure
of
the
eastlake
charter
relative
to
rezoning
constitutes
unlawful
delegation
of
legislative
power
to
the
electorate
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
i
believe
basically
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
got
the
cart
before
the
horse
because
the
delegation
as
power
is
not
from
the
council
to
the
people
but
it
is
exactly
the
opposite
under
the
charter
and
under
the
ohio
constitution.
the
power
is
given
by
the
people
to
the
council.
they
can
give
as
much
of
the
power
to
the
council
as
they
desire
or
they
can
retain
it
onto
themselves.
really,
what
is
involved
here,
we
believe
is
a
struggle
on
a
local
issue
between
whether
the
final
power
of
rezoning
shall
reside
in
the
city
council,
or
whether
it
shall
reside
in
the
people.
the
supreme
court
has
placed
in
jeopardy
the
final
power
of
the
people
in
respect
to
rezoning.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
correct.
now,
the
history
of
ohio
without
exception
has
made
a
determination
that
rezoning
a
property
is
a
legislative
act
and
as
such,
subject
to
referendum.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
right.
we
are
not
talking
a
variance
here
nor
on
hardship,
nor
administering
of
the
act.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
right.
the
basic
thinking
is
as
long
as
the
people
have
the
initial
right
to
enact
zoning
ordinances,
then
they
also
have
the
right
of
change.
because
if
that
were
not
so,
then
the
final
power
of
zoning
would
vest
in
the
council
and
not
in
the
people.
we
believe,
that
my
basic
position
is,
this
is
just
a
pure
local
issue
as
to
where
that
power
should
be
vested.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
there
are
cases
throughout
united
states
where
they
have
called
rezoning,
a
quasi-judicial
act
or
an
administrative
act
and
attempted
to
get
around
the
referendum
because
the
referendum
even
on
ohio
is
restricted
to
legislative
act.
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
even
in
this
case,
found
this
to
be
a
legislative
act
and
cited
the
ohio
law
which
backs
that
up.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
absolutely
not.
this
is
the
basic
problem
here
that
there
is
no
claim
whatsoever
that
the
existing
zoning
classification
of
the
property,
the
industrial
zone
classification
is
any
matter
unreasonable.
there
is
no
claim
that
there
is
any
economic
damage
to
the
respondent
here
by
virtue
of
the
failure
of
the
city
rezoning.
no,
this
property
maybe
equally
valuable
as
industrial
property,
maybe
more
so
than
it
would
as
multiple
family
zone
housing.
there
is
no
–
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
it
would
be
good
city
planning
to
rezone
the
property
as
request.
in
fact,
the
proposed
parcel
is
located
directly
between
industry
and
business
zone
property.
the
very
purpose
or
the
reason
that
this
came
into
being
is
that
the
respondent
here
is
a
very
large
developer
property
throughout
the
ohio
district,
and
the
history
has
been
such
that
they
can
go
into
a
given
community
and
exercise
much
power
of
control
over
the
council
and
so
the
city
of
eastlake
residents
felt
rightly
or
wrongly
that
forest
city
had
too
much
sway
over
council
and
that
council
is
making
these
decisions
not
because
of
what
is
good
for
the
city
but
because
of
pressures
and
so
forth
what
was
good
for
forest
city.
and
the
very
traditional
concept
of
referendum,
was
to
sort
of
counterbalance
the
wealthy
and
entrenched,
so
that
the
people
could
reserve
themselves
the
power
to
in
effect
veto,
the
actions
of
their
council
if
they
did
not
like
them.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
the
only
way
we
got
into
the
federal
implication
is
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
may
know
finding
of
any
violation
of
ohio
law
but
said
that
this
procedure
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
our
premise
is
that
--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
well,
they
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
there
was--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
–
i
do
not
believe
it
is
a
question
for
federal
constitutional
constraint
at
all.
i
think
it
is
a
pure
local
issue--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
rezoning,
i
mean,
there
are
two
different
things.
variance
is
administrative
probably--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
probably,
a
variance
is
usually
given
to
a
board
of
appeals
and
generally
speaking,
i
think
variance
is
to
be
considered
administrative.
probably-
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
do
not
believe
there
would
be
any.
i
think
the
line
is
drawn
here.
we
go
back
to
the
ambler
reality
case,
1926,
in
which
this
court,
in
its
initial
case
finding
the
general
zoning
to
be
valid
under
the
police
powers,
said
number
one,
that
it
had
to
be
reasonable
and
secondly
it
had
to
pass
certain
test,
it
has
to
bear
a
reasonable
resemblance
to
the
public
health
safety,
morals
and
welfare.
i
believe
that
if
the
final
decision
of
the
council
people
and
so
forth,
violates
those
safeguards
of
ambler,
then
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
then
it
should
be
determined
whether
or
not
it
is
non-constitution
restriction,
but
in
the
absence
of
that,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
federal
constitution
has
anything
to
do
with
the
decision
of
the
people
so
long
as
the
decision
is
reasonable
as
it
applies
to
any
given
property.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
would
you
repeat
that
please.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
agree.
this
is
far
field
from
our
issues
here.
i
do
not
know
that
i
can--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
court
decisions
constitutionally
can
be
made
to
subject
of
a
vote
of
people
and
everything.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
pardon?
i
believe
that
legislation
matters
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
people
would
have
that
power.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
well,
like
i
said,
it
requires
so
much.
i
just
have
not
considered
that
kind
of
a
question
here.
i
think
that
we
are
into
a
different
area.
i
think
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
local
decision
not
with
court
decision
that
we
are
dealing
legislative
matters
which
are
subject
to
vote
of
the
people.
now,
whether
judicial
matter
is
subject
to
vote
of
people
is
another
question.
i
do
not
think
it
involved
here.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
it
would
have
been
much
more
difficult
to
be
here
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
placed
this
entirely
upon
the
federal
constitution
basis
and
in
effect
by
their
silence,
it
has
held
that
this
does
not
violate
ohio
constitutional
or
general
laws.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
think
that
there
will
be
no
difference,
whatsoever.
the
traditional
concept
of
ohio
law
and
i
have
quoted
all
of
these
various
decision
in
my
briefs
but,
many
of
the
statues
of
ohio
require
55%,
60%,
and
65%
majority.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
right
and
that
is
the
precise
issue
that
we
are
talking
here
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
respondent
contends.
that
it
is
the
procedure
by
which
this
is
given
to
the
people
that
they
are
arguing
about.
they
do
not
seem
to
say
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
having
referendum
on
zoning
matters
as
long
as
there
is
10%
petition
circulated
but
the
moment
you
eliminate
that
10%
petition
and
say
it
would
be
by
automatic
referendum
then
they
say
that
is
not
correct.
but
anyhow,
really,
this
does
not
make
that
much
change
because
in
the
zoning
procedures
under
the
eastlake
charter
and
this
is
traditional
method,
first
of
all
it
goes
to
the
planning
commission
and
then
there
is
a
public
hearing
for
the
planning
commission,
then
it
goes
to
the
city
council
as
it
plans
a
public
hearing
for
city
planning
–
city
council.
this
far,
the
amendment
makes
no
change
whatsoever,
if
city
council
turns
the
change
down
it
makes
no
difference.
it
is
only
in
the
event
that
city
council
approves
the
proposed
rezoning
that
for
the
first
time
does
this
amendment
come
in
to
play
and
then
it
says
before
that
decision
of
city
council
becomes
final
then
it
must
be
approved
by
a
majority
vote
of
people.
now,
if
we
have
a
voter
whose
property
of
rezoning
is
destined
to
become
a
subject
referendum
by
the
10%
petition,
it
makes
no
difference
at
all
other
than
the
fact
the
electors
have
to
circulate
their
10%
petition.
and
in
the
other
side
of
the
defense,
if
it
does
make
a
difference,
it
might
add
as
much
as
six
months
time
to
the
application
because
you
do
have
to
submit
it
for
a
vote
of
the
people
and
there
is
some
delay
involved
there.
i
think
we
should
at
least
mention
because
of
judge
stern’s
decision
that
the
record
does
not
substantiate
any
claim
of
racial
or
economic
discrimination
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
respondent
will
probably
back
me
up.
there
is
no
record
in
this
case,
whatsoever
except
for
the
charter
and
the
applicable
ordinances.
so,
really,
we
are
talking
entirely
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
eastlake
procedure
provided
for
rezoning.
it
is
a
little
unfortunate
because
in
the
ohio
supreme
court,
there
was
a
housing
unit
that
filed
a
brief
which
was
far
field
from
the
record
in
this
case
and
there
they
advocated
the
discrimination
and
impeding
a
right
travel
and
so
forth
and
judge
stern
in
his
concurring
majority
opinion
picked
up
this
kind
of
wording
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
record
in
this
case
substantiates
that
and
i
do
not
believe
it
is
basically
a
discrimination
case.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
believe
that
this
case
is
pretty
well
governed
by
the
finding
of
this
court
in
the
valtierra
case
rising
out
of
california.
almost
the
same
arguments
were
made
in
that
case
even
though
that
case
applied
to
a
public
housing.
it
was
a
constitutional
amendment
of
the
state
of
california
requiring
before
any
law
in
housing
comes
in
any
community,
it
is
subject
automatic
referendum
requirements.
in
the
same
case,
the
same
arguments
was
made
in
here
that
people
or
the
developers
were
entitled
this
10%
procedure
type
petition
and
there
are
the
judge
black,
i
believe
in
the
ruling
says
that
the
referendum
is
a
democratic
decision
making
procedure
which
by
ensuring
at
all
people
of
community
will
have
a
voice
in
the
decision
which
may
lead
in
large
expenditure.
local
government
funds
will
increase
public
services.
so,
it
gives
them
voice
in
decisions,
it
will
effect
the
development
of
the
community.
and,
i
think
that
is
what
we
are
saying
here,
that
this
is
a
means
whereby
the
people
have
the
constitutional
right
to
reserve
on
to
themselves
the
power
in
respect
to
rezoning.
now,
if
rezoning
was
a
power
that
was
set
aside
by
the
ohio
constitution
and
said
no,
you
cannot
vote
on
that,
that
be
something
else.
there
are
certain
things
such
as
fiscal
matter
and
tax
matters
which
are
exempt.
rezoning
is
not
one
of
them
and
rezoning
has
traditionally
been
subject
to
a
vote
of
people
and
first
of
all
adopting
the
general
zoning
plan
and
secondly,
we
feel
that
they
have
the
power
to
adopt.
they
have
the
power
to
rezone.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
are
you
speaking
of
--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
we
are
speaking
now
of
the
two
cases.
the
supreme
court
below
and
also
the
respondents
here
relied
pretty
much
upon
roberge
and
this
is
a
case
way
back
in
1928
in
which
the
court
held
that
a
philanthropic
home
could
not
to
be
made
a
subject
of
voting
by
people
located
in
the
same
block
and
also
the
eubank
case
which
was
in
1912
and
this
is
one
which
they
attempted
to
establish
building
lines
by
adjacent
neighbors.
and
we
believe
that
neither
of
these
cases
are
correctly
interpreted
by
the
respondent
or
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
because
these
are
neighborhood
preference
cases
and
they
say
that
they
can
not
have
a
vote
of
people,
in
neighborhood’s
preference
case
unless
there
are
established
standards.
but
even
in
those
cases,
in
each
case,
the
court
says
the
power
to
locate
a
philanthropic
home,
or
the
general
part
of
the
city
located
philanthropic
home,
we
do
not
decide.
and
in
the
other
case,
the
power
to
establish
building
lines,
we
do
not
decide.
so
these
are
the
cases
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
respondent
and
i
think
they
are
misinterpreted
or
mis-relied
upon
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
this
is
exactly
the
wording
which
was
used
by
district
court
case
of
california,
the
alameda
spanish
speaking
case,
which
they
said
that
these
two
cases
were
misinterpreted
and
were
not
a
basis
for
a
finding
where
the
entire
referendum
power
of
the
city
is
involved.
i
will
save
the
remaining
time
--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
yes.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
no.
the
reason
this
was
circulated
for
petition
and
so
forth,
it
was
conceded
by
the
respondent
that
the
petition
was
correctly
circulated,
that
amendment
was
correctly
made
and
so
the
reason
why
this
amendment
was
made
is
somewhat
immaterial
to
this
case.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i,
that
is
certainly
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
supposed
it
is
a
presumption
that,
i
do
not
think
it
is
important
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
no.
i
am
saying
this
that
the
city
council
is
the
subservient
to
the
electors.
in
other
words,
as
i
am
saying
that
the
final
decision
is
not
in
council.
the
final
decision
is
in
the
electors
and
that
the
electors
have
the
constitutional
right
to
veto
the
access,
as
they
are
elected
representative
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
certainly
hope
so
and
as
they
stated
in
the
valtierra
case
that
such
procedure,
referendum
procedure
show
a
devotion
to
democracy
and
not
to
bias
and
prejudice.
so
i
hope
that
we
can
assume
that,
yes.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
no,
they
used
equal
protection
but
the
arguments
were
the
same.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
think
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
requirement
and
i
think
an
unconstitutional
requirement.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
do
not
know
that
the
courts
have
ever
really
drawn
that
line.
i
know
in
ohio
they
have
held
that
55%
is
constitutional
in
certain
issues.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
yes.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
court
has
ever
held
that
and
also
as
far
as
i
know,
no
court
has
ever
held
the
automatic
referendum
procedure
or
process
itself
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
absolutely.
you
have
the
same
ambler
procedure
safeguards
to
the
final
decision.
that
is
why
i
am
saying
that
the
way
that
the
political
decision
is
made,
be
it
by
the
people
or
council
is
of
very
low
consequence,
but
if
they
make
the
wrong
decision,
be
it
council
or
people,
then
we
go
into
the
ambler
to
ask
if
it
is
unreasonable.
it
is
subject
to
judicial
scrutiny
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
i
would
think
so,
almost
without
doubt.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
just
very
briefly
in
answer
to
the
question
of
justice
stewart.
the
decision
would
be
reviewable
the
same
from
the
council
or
the
people.
that
type
of
case
you
look
at
the
property
and
determine
what
the
restrictions
are
in
the
property
and
whether
decision
made
by
council
or
people,
makes
no
difference.
are
those
restrictions
are
reasonable
or
are
they
not,
that
is
the
issue
there.
secondly,
i
think
mr.
ginn’s
position
is
he
does
not
want
the
people
to
vote
on
rezoning
and
thirdly,
in
respect
to
the
eastlake
charter,
rezoning
has
always
been
a
subject
of
referendum
under
the
eastlake
charter.
the
only
difference
being
that
under
old
system
so
we
speak,
it
required
a
10%
petition
of
the
people
in
order
to
bring
the
referendum
to
vote
and
the
substantive
rights
are
the
same.
now,
the
only
difference
is
the
procedure
is
different.
instead
of
the
requirement
that
the
people
circulate
at
10%
petition
that
is
eliminated.
that
is
the
only
difference.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
let
us
get
straight
on
this
cost.
the
law
court
held
the
fact
that
the
cost
of
the
referendum
should
be
chargeable
to
the
applicant
was
unconstitutional.
we
have
accepted
that
and
we
have
not
pursued
it
on
review
so
that
is
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
correct.
it
was
just
very
recently
that
a
piece
of
property
up
the
street
from
this
particular
property
was
put
up
through
a
vote
of
people.
it
was
nine
acre
parcel
from
industrial
business.
they
received
the
78%
majority
vote
so
--
but
this
is
true
we
draw
the
line
at
rezoning.
yes.
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
variance
is
something
else.
we
are
talking
on
rezoning,
yes
sir
--
mr.
j.
melvin
andrews
that
is
right.
if
it
got
into
a
variance
set,
that
is
administrative,
that
is
not
subject
to
a
referendum.
