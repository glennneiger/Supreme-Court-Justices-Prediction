unknown

your
entire
argument
is
based
upon
hypothesis
that
zoning
is
a
legislative
function,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
now,
a
variance
would
probably
be
administrative
quasi-
judicial
act,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
on
the
general
zoning
provision.
unknown
speaker
if
one
thought
of
zoning,
generally
zoning
as
a
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
function,
you
could
not
make
the
arguments
you
are
making,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
under
the
ohio
law,
it
has
traditionally
been
considered
a
legislative
function?
unknown
speaker
in
what
respect?
well,
i
understand
this
but
in
my
example,
what
provision
of
the
federal
constitution
do
you
think
might
be
implicated?
unknown
speaker
how
about
you?
what
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
local
legislative
bodies
could
leave
to
the
electorate,
all
questions
of
rezoning
or
variances?
unknown
speaker
just
take
the
variance
then,
just
take
the
variance.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
state
of
ohio
should
make
every
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
subject
to
popular
recall,
referendum?
would
that
violate
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
let
us
say,
this
ohio
state
legislature
provided
that
every
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
upon
initiative
of
5%
of
the
people
could
be
subject
to
referendum
and
recall
in
i.e.
popular
overruling,
would
that
violate
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
it
is
very
far
field
in
theory,
at
least
arguably.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)

command
any

(voice

sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
but
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
hypothesis
does
not
involve
those,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
over
a
simple
majority
rather
than
a
55%?
unknown
speaker
here
is
whether
they
were
right
in
saying
that
merely
submitting
it
to
a
referendum
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
--
i
think
this
dealt
specifically
with
two
or
three
decisions
in
this
court
upon
which
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
relied,
have
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
understood
you
indicate
that
the
referendum
was
required
because
some
history
indicate
that
the
council
subservient
to
a
large
economic
interest
of
some
kind.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that?
unknown
speaker
but
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
the
record
is
silent
on
why
this
procedure
was
adopted?
unknown
speaker
and
you
suggested
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
there
is
any
public
interest
in
having
this
rezoning
take
place.
should
we
not
presume
that
the
city
council
acted
in
the
best
interest
of
the
community?
and
therefore,
there
is
some
public
interest
to
be
served
by
this
particular
rezoning?
unknown
speaker
you
represent
the
city
and
you,
as
lawyer
for
the
city,
you
are
describing
the
city
council
the
way
you
did
earlier
that
there
is
subservient
outside
interest?
unknown
speaker
the
valtierra
case
did
not
involve
a
due
process
as
you
did?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
logical
end
of
your
last
statement.
suppose
the
citizen
adopt
a
amendment
to
the
city
charter
and
say
instead
of
55%
we
have
to
have
95%
and
then
along
comes
a
referendum
on
this
kind
of
rezoning
ordinance
and
only
93%
vote
the
favor
of
it?
unknown
speaker
they
draw
the
line
then?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
the
55%?
