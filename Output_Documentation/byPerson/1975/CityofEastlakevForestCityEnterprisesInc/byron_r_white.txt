justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
there
has
been
no
city
council
ordinance,
no
referendum
in
this
case
that
you
should
win
because
industrial
zoning
is
unreasonable
to
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
only
is
that
you
are
left
with
industrial
zoning?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
you
are
being
unreasonably
restrained
in
the
use
of
your
properties?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
by
the
use
of
reasonable
restriction
above
the
use
of
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
that
every
votes
of
the
city
council
once
the
planning
commission
acts,
it
goes
to
the
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would,
i
guess
you
would
see
an
argument
that
it
is
planning
committee
make
a
right
decision,
city
council
(inaudible)
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
which
comes
out
with
the
decision
which
announces
the
next
morning
without
any
reason
at
all.
that
is
procedurally
deficient
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
city
council
does
it.
the
only
thing
is
it
just
does
not
tell
you
who
is
going
to
do
it,
has
no
public
hearings,
there
is
not
one
single
procedural
right
extended
to
any
member
of
the
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
litigant
is
the
property
owner.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
just
said
the
city
council
just
announces,
we
think
industrial
zoning
is
just
fine
for
this
property.
now,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
there
as
you
are
making
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
careful
condition,
their
approval
on
their
being
as
many
as
20%
in
the
community
who
agreed
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
just
assume
the
ordinance
said
no
city
council's
rezoning
shall
be
--
shall
take
effect
until
as
20%
of
the
people
in
the
referendum
approved.
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)if
everything
you
wanted
to
say
about
it,
got
an
every
single
voters
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
let
us
assume
that
the
states
and
you
want
to
say
we
will
make
sure
it
gets
in
the
hands
of
every
voter.
i
take
it
your
problem
is
that
you
think
voters
voted
in
a
way
that
it
may
be
completely
irrational?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
really
a
procedural
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
fact
that
--
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
voting
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
not,
you
just
really
will
not
just
accept
the
fact
decision
is
made
by
the
individual
voter,
by
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
have
accorded
all
the
process
that
anybody
could
have
imagined
and
you
still
would
be
here
objecting?
