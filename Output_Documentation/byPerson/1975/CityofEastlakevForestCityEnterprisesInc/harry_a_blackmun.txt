justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
this
case,
instead
of
coming
up
from
ohio,
came
up
from
a
rural
county
in
massachusetts
where
everything
is
done
by
town
meeting,
would
you
be
making
the
same
arguments
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
know
what
a
town
meeting
is?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
town
meeting
and
the
decisions
made
that
night
are
there
standards
ever,
people
can
just
vote?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
that
is
your
13
there,
necessarily
means
that
the
town
meeting
procedure
is
unconstitutional
when
it
comes
to
rezoning?
