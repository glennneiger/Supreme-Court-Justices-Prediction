the
time
when
this
referendum
requirement
was
put
in?

(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
and
if
so
do
you
rely
on
that
time
sequence
as
part
of
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ginn,
you
were
going
to
tell
us
and
you
never
did.
what
are
the
three
you
are
relying
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
is
the
lack
of
standards,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
again,
i
take
it
you
attach
any
significance
either
to
the
fact
that
the
property
owner
bears
the
cost
of
the
election?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
andrews,
let
me
just
get
the
55%
requirement
clear
in
my
mind.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
if
an
individual
say
an
owner
of
a
two
flat,
one
at
the
rezone,
the
single
family
is
just
a
very
minor
30-foot
lot,
wanted
to
change,
that
property
owner
would
still
in
order
to
get
that
done
had
to
bare
the
cost
of
a
city
wide
referendum
to
get
approved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
if
that
is
true,
no
matter
how
small
the
parcel
and
no
matter
how
minor
the
change
in
zoning,
the
property
owner
has
the
burden
of
getting
a
55%
of
the
electorate
to
agree
to
that
particular
change?
