it
was
authorizing
legislation
was
not
it?
both
acts
were
authorizing
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
authorized
the
school
boards
to
do
this
if
they
wanted
do?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
thought
and
that
was
true
on
both
acts,
both
for
the
school
board
and
the
police
jury?
justice
stewart
so
it
was
a
constitutional
holding?
justice
potter
stewart
the
school
board
and
the
police
jury
had
legislative
authority
to
do
it,
did
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
really
authorizing
acts
of
the
state
legislature?
justice
stewart
you
are
urging
that
the
case
is
what?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
police
juries
continue
to
be
without
legislative
power
to
reinforce
themselves,
is
that
right,
because
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
they
do
not
themselves
have
legislative
power
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
authorizing
statute
is
being
--
has
been
suspended
while
it
is
pending
approval
under
section
5
in
the
justice
department,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
been
squarely
held
that
a
court
ordered
plan
is
not
subject
to
section
5,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
a
court
ordered
plan,
in
contrast
with
legislative
plan.

legislative
body,
statewide
or
local?
