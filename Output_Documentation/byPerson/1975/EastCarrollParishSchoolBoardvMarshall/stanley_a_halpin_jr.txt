mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
certain
factual
matters
that,
and
i
feel
compelled
to
correct
at
the
outset,
the
matter
of
the
question
on
the
percentage
of
black
voter
registration
in
parish
has
been
raising,
question
from
mr.
justice
stevens
and
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
assert
that
as
of
the
particular
time
in
which
they
refer
to
in
their
brief
that
there
was
a
majority
of
black
voters
and
their
figures
i
think
showed
the
they
were
17
more
black
voters
than
white
voters.
however,
i
checked
this
and
my
information
is
that
there
was
only
a
short
period
of
time
of
approximately
three
weeks
during
the
summer
of
'75
in
which
this
was
the
case
due
to
a
flux
in
adaption
of
the
new
louisiana
constitution
which
enfranchised
a
new
segment
of
people
and
blacks
in
the
parish
as
they
always
do
their
work
hard
and
got
sort
of
a
jump
on
the
registration
for
a
few
weeks,
but
then
the
registration
went
back
to
it
is
normal
level
so
that
the
figures
that
i
have
obtained
from
--
had
someone
obtain
from
the
registrar
of
voters
in
east
carroll
parish
yesterday
are
as
follows:
that
there
are
3,511
blacks
registered
and
3759
whites
registered
or
a
white
majority
of
248
voters.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
precisely
your
honor.
they
are
facts
--
this
may
be
--
this
is
just
one
of
them,
but
there
are
also
inferences
to
be
drawn
and
so
these
facts
have
also
been
elections
and
have
on
--
been
run
in
five
years
since
the
trial
of
this
case.
these
are
matters
of
serious
contest
and
i
frankly
cannot
see
how
we
can,
you
know,
we
cannot
resolve
the
case
on
the
facts
as
they
exist.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
refer
to.
my
--
i
do
not
have
my
complete
file
with
me.
my
recollection
is
that
i
filed
a
motion
to
modify
the
injunction
which
then
resulted
in
the
court
order.
i
am
not
absolutely
positive
and
i
will
be
glad
to
communicate
by
letter
and
attach,
if
that
was
the
case,
but
certainly
the
situation
was
that
the
petitioners
had
certainly
every
right
to
move
the
court
to
reconsider
or
rehear
had
they
object
into
the
second
order.
there
is
no
question,
second
order
was
done
very
rapidly
while
hearing.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
after
appeal
had
been
noticed.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
(voice

i
think
the
--
if
we
are
dealing
with
injunctive
matter,
particularly
in
elections
where
you
have
a
great
deal
of
flux
that
certainly
district
court
has
the
right
to
modify
an
injunction
to
meet
present
circumstances
and
change
in
law
or
whatever
and
that,
particularly
in
this
case
there
are
procedures
which
we
indicated
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
that
at
least
eight
of
the
circuits
agree
that
in
situations
as
this
where
the
district
judge
is
changing
his
mind,
the
proper
procedure
is
for
the
district
judge
to
indicate
his
difference
and
then
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
remand
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
(voice

mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
if
i
filed
the
motion,
i
did,
serving
on
the
other
side,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
mr.
ward
was
not
counsel
then,
so
i
think
he
was
saying
he
does
not
know,
but
i
will
be
glad
to
supply
the
court
with
whatever
was
filed
or
indicate
the
letter
that
no
motion
was
filed,
but
my
recollection,
although
that
was
five
years
ago,
my
recollection
is
that
i
did
file
something
and
my
practice
as
an
attorney
is
always
to
serve
or
file
a
motion
to
serve
an
(voice

mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
they
mean
that
he
is
out
of
jurisdiction
just
in
regard
and
i
think
the
proper
procedure
at
that
stage
would
have
been
to
remand
the
case
so
that
perhaps
within
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
it
is
not
--
frankly
it
is
not
absolutely
clear.
i
have
to
guess
of
course
to
certain
extinct
as
to
what
the
judge
was
saying
and
there
was
not
a
particular
--
i
raised
that
on
oral
--
orally
before
this
--
it
does
appear
in
a
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir
and
i
can
only
assume
that
what
was
going
on
with
the
district
judge
is
that
--
that
somehow
he
did
not
consider
himself
in
the
situation
of
drawing
a
remedy
or
that
somehow
that
case
--
i
really
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
cannot
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
what
i
think
--
yes
i
think
it
is
one
way
or
the
other.
i
can
not
really
read
his
mind,
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
he
was
saying,
perhaps
was
saying
that
“well,
this
is
a
legislative
enactment
and
it
is
not
a
connor
versus
johnson
situation.”
i
think
it
is
either
or
then
it
should
be
going
in
section
5
and
if
not
it
is
under
connor
versus
johnson,
chapman
versus
meier
and
--
but
exactly
was
is
at
that
time
i
cannot
really
tell
the
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
in
view
of
that
second
order
that
it
is.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
it
is
moot,
your
honor
in
view
of
the
second
order
in
that,
this
is
here
on
certiorari
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
would
assume
that
it
is.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
a
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
by
the
other
side
to
the
second
order
and
assume
it
was
then
launched.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
would,
you
know,
(inaudible)
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
in
the
sense
that
the
district
court
has
definitely
indicated
its
view
to
change
its
mind.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
my
first
preference
but
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
that
would
accomplish
in
some
respects,
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
best.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
that
would
accomplish
our
purpose
and
that
would
be
treating
it
as
a
chapman
versus
meier
situation,
but
the
reason
that
i
am
concerned
about
that
your
honor
is
that
i
think
this
is
a
section
5
situation.
we
have
got
not
only
this
case
to
deal
with,
but
we
have
got
many
other
cases
to
deal
with
and
i
am
familiar
with
those,
particularly
in
louisiana
where
these
court
decrees
have
been
used
to
circumvent
section
5.
we
lodged
in
the
record
for
the
court’s
benefit,
i
think
which
--
i
find
worse
example
of
this,
but
a
classic
example
of
circumvention,
a
case
named
whatley
v.
union
parish.
it
is
a
very
short
record.
everything
was
filed
on
the
same
day.
it
is
about
ten
days.
the
complaint
was
filed
on
the
same
day.
the
answer
was
filed
on
the
same
day.
an
order
was
filed
and
signed
on
the
same
day
by
the
court
approving
a
plan
for
the
redistricting
of
union
parish,
louisiana,
a
place
where
a
significant
black
population
which
the
justice
department
had
only
months
before
objected
to
under
section
5
as
a
violation
and
the
thing
is,
i
think
the
way
to
hear
this
case
would
be
to
make
a
clear
pronouncement
with
this
court,
that
this
is
clearly
covered
for
instance
by
connor
versus
waller,
that
this
sort
of
circumvention
should
not
continue.
we
cited
in
footnote
32
of
our
brief
which
i
believe
is
at
page
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
connor
against
waller,
your
honor
is
the
mississippi
situation
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
specifically
the
court
indicated
there
that
--
the
district
court
in
holding
that
--
here
the
court
had
--
this
mississippi
state
legislature
had
adopted
a
court,
it
is
very
similar
to
that
which
the
district
court
--
the
three-judge
district
court
had
adopted.
and
then
the
district
court
said
that,
“well,
this
is
not
subject
to
section
5.
”this
court
said
“it
was
subject
to
section
5,”
and
said
that
the
court
should
not
have
considered
those
different
racial
allegations.
but
at
footnote
32
of
our
brief
on
page
18,
we
cite
a
number
of
cases,
i
think
there
are
about
ten
or
12,
all
in
that
same
district
in
louisiana
in
which
the
courts
have
approved
the
redistricting
plans
without
they
ever
having
been
submitted
under
section
5.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
here
your
honor
the
police
jury
adopted
a
resolution.
they
sent
a
letter.
the
court
said
we
have
adopted
this,
please
incorporate
it
in
your
fourth
coming
order.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
it
is
terribly
familiar
with
it,
but
that
could
be
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
just
about
it,
your
honor.
i
think
so,
in
connor
you
had
this
on
going
redistricting
litigation
as
to
restricting
the
judges
in
the
context
of
litigation
just
as
much
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
it
is
not
clear
what
they
say.
at
one
point
on
their
brief
at
page
six,
i
think
they
admit
quite
the
opposite.
they
say
that
this
was
not
court
fashioned
plan,
this
was
something
the
police
jury
had
been
working
on
even
before.
they
say
that
it
is
something
that
should
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
so
that
technically,
however,
there
are
lots
of
bodies,
police
juries
and
school
boards
which
have
continued
to
do
that
to
enact
it
without
that
authorization
and
incidentally,
again,
a
point
of
factual
correction,
the
objection
to
561
dealing
with
school
boards
has
been
lifted,
but
the
objection
to
445
dealing
with
police
juries
has
been
never
been
removed
by
the
justice
department
and
that
was
a
mistake
in
the
fact.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
to
go
at-large.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
to
go
at-large?
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
they
can
redistrict
themselves
as
long
as
they
do
it
to
single-member
districts.
they
cannot
go
at-large
using
that
new
statute
under
current
law.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
right.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
well,
it
is
been
objected
to.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
as
practical
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
think
it
is
indistinguishable
your
honor.
i
think
it
is,
i
think
it
is
a
situation
where
you
do
have
an
adoption,
although
in
the
sense
that
they
do
not
have
authority
to
adopt
it
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
think
the
--
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
the
test
here
is
who
drafted
the
plan.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
i
think,
i
think
that,
i
think
that
distinction
is
over
settled
and
does
not
really
meet
the
needs
of
interpretation
involves.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
i
think
if
you
read
connor
versus
waller
with
connor
versus
johnson
wherein
in
connor
versus
johnson
you
had
a
situation
where
the
court
was
drawing
its
own
plan
as
an
interim
measure,
and
this
court
says
“okay,
that
is
beyond
the
reach
of
section
5,”
that
is
the
exact
facts
in
narrow
holding
that.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
yes
sir.
frequently
they
are
now
appointing
special
masters
who
do
draft
the
plans
and
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
of
course
it
is
always
an
adversary
situation,
yes
sir.
and,
but,
as
a
--
the
practice
--
i
realize
that
--
i
think
the
technical
line
when
you
read
connor
versus
johnson
together
with
connor
versus
waller,
that
the
rule
comes
out
that
you
do
have
to
attempt
to
make
this
determinations
as
to
what
is
--
whether
this
is
a
preacher
of
the
court
or
preacher
of
the
legislature
and
to
not
do
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
okay.
this
is
where
i
think
it
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
think
that
if
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
in
the
sense
where
it
is
a
court
drawn
plan,
but
i
think
the
--
certainly
the
primary
jurisdiction
is
under
section
--
it
should
be
under
section
5
and
that
at
the
proper
course,
for
instance,
for
a
court
to
do
in
this
action
unless
it
is
emergency
situation
we
had
to
(voice

mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no
sir,
of
course
not.
i
am
speaking
only
where
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
section
5
jurisdiction.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
where
section
--
no,
where
section
5
coverage
exists,
i
think
the
proper
course
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
it
is
been
squarely
held
your
honor
that
our
plan
which
was
drawn
by
the
court
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
my
concern
also
--
i
have
certainly,
chapman
versus
meier
and
connor
versus
johnson
would
require
single-member
districts
back,
but
i
wanted
this
opportunity
to
point
out
to
the
court
some
of
the
very
difficult
practical
problems
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
louisiana
and
other
places
and
that
there
should
be
some
mechanism
to
avoid
the
circumvention
of
section
5
through
court
orders
and
that
mechanism
would
be
as
such
as
we
are
suggested
in
the
brief
either
to
get
to
draw

mr.

your

mr.

now,
inadvertently
it
happens
that
way.
i
am
not
suggesting
any
intent
whatsoever,
but
i
think
because
(voice

mr.
stanley

(voice

flexibility
in
the
law,
i
am
asking
this
court
really
to
clear
it
up.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
i
would
suggest
this
your
honor,
that
if
the
law,
if
this
court
will
make
a
clear
pronouncement
on
that
then
there
would
not
be
this
sort
of
fuzzy
area
between
section
5
which
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
your
honor,
i
--
well
that
is
one
of
the
problems
that
might
(voice

mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,

i
think
the
principal
difference
in
this
case
(voice

mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
as
a
practical
matter,
the
difference
is
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies
which
to
the
extent
to
which
that
is
a
fact
in
the
case
it
would
make
a
difference
in
the
standards,
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
at-large
elections
it
seems
that
substantive
standards,
it
is
not
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
[laughter]
no
sir.
i
was
this
--
the
--
what
i
would
urge
the
court
is
that
if
as
the
court
has
suggested
that
this
is
a
creature
of
the
court,
a
court
ordered
plan
which
would
not
be
under
section
5,
that
clearly
connor
versus
johnson
and
chapman
versus
meier
would
require
that
single-member
district
be
devised
as
a
remedy.
the
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
oh!
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
here
we
have
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well
we
have
a
resolution
of
the
school
board
of
november
18th,
1968
or
whatever
it
is
and
it
is
--
the
question
is
that
well,
actually
(voice
overlap)
not
(voice
overlap)
have
authority
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
well,
there
is
certainly
in
any
event
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
are
number
of
things
that
had
happen
since
this
case
was
tried
some
five
years
ago
and
i
think
it
is
certainly
is
appropriate
a
thing
to
be
considered
on
the
present
facts
and
in
this
court
is
in
no
position
to
do
that.i
would
think
that
it
should
be
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
particular
that
since
now
the
school
board
does
have
one
body,
does
have
the
authority
to
be
able
to
go
at-large
then
maybe
that
is
the
result
that
we
will
have
to
reach
ultimately
and
that
some
of
this
questions
may
be
metaphysical
because
when
it
comes
back
to
the
court,
the
court
will
be
in
the
situation,
this
board
now
has
the
authority
to
do
it
and
may
well
be
an
enactment
then
under
connor
versus
waller
and
there
was
at
the
courts
that
those
are
the
matters
that
will
have
to
be
resolved.
thank
you.
