that
was
an

that
was

justice
byron

white
who
requested
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
had
retained
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
and
he
must
have

justice

[voice

a
new
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
did
he
enter
a
new
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ward
was
your
--
what
was
the
judges'
answer
to
contentions
in
a
district
court
or
that
--
without
even
getting
the
constitutional
issues
that
the
preference
is
for
single
member
districts
when
a
court
is
fashioning
a
real
question
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
not
that
--
that
is
--
this
court
has
said
that
is
the
normal
rules,
is
not
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
multi-member
districts
are
not,
necessarily
are
not
per
se
unconstitutional
if
a
court
has
to
come
up
with
a
plan
or
approval
plan
and
that
the
preference
is
for
single
member
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
i
may
not
be
of
understanding
what
i
asked
you
was
what
was
the
district
court's
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
it
--
put
into
effect
by
a
court
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
not
a
piece
of
legislation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
it
is
not
a
piece
of
legislation,
it
was
a
court
ordered
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
they
did,
which
is
normal
in
reapportionment
cases.
you
get
to
submit
plans,
that
is
where
they
usually
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
have
no
legislative
authority
to
do.
they
could
certainly
comply
with
the
court's
request
to
submit
a
plan,
but
they
could
not
legislate
without
the
statutory
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
was
that
urged
in
the
--
was
it
urged
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
single
member
districts
should
have
been
put
in
because
the
preference
expressed
by
this
court
for
single
member
districts
in
court
ordered
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
did
the
district
court
tried
to
change
its
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
did
not
it
put
it
in
single
member
districts
while
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
they
would
not
have
any
need
for
one,
they
will
even
have
an
en
banc
hearing
if
the
district
court
was
already
ready
to
put
in
a
single-member
district
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
case
come
to
us
we
are
talking
to
the
validity
of
a
district
court
order
that
the
district
judge
who
wants
to
scrap
and
has
tried
to
scrap?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
not
that
true
that
is
the
fact,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
set
in
that
--
it
had
--
that
district
judge
had
no
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
on
whether
the
district
court
--
i
take
it
you
felt
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
it
is
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it
the
district
judge’s
second
order
and
decided
that
they
would
either
--
could
not
or
would
not
consider
it
because
in
their
view
he
had
no
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
district
judge’s
answer
to
connor
against
--
connor
v.
johnson
claim
that
single-member
districts
were
to
be
preferred
when
the
court
adopted
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
raised
--
then
you
raise
the
same
thing
that
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
put
it
on
a
constitutional
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
not
there
--
that
was
a
section
5
matter?then
if
he
--
](voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
urging
that
this
case
(inaudible)
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
connor
against
waller
involved
a
--
whatever
was
submitted
to
the
district
court
in
that
case
was
a
product
of
legislative
action,
it
was
a
piece
of
legislation?
justice
white
but
your
colleague
says
that
when
this
plan
was
adopted
it
had
no
legislative
power
to
adopt
it.
it
was
just
responding
to
a
request
to
the
court?
justice
white
well,
maybe
--
his
point
was
that
under
the
state's
authorize
--
the
state
authorizing
statute
was
not
important.
justice
white
well,
that
is
also
a
little
--
it
is
also
the
question
you
want
to
raise
seems
to
run
against
the
grain
of
our
prior
cases?
justice
white
oh!
yes,
but
the
fact
remains
that
once
the
plan
was
issued
by
the
district
court
the
locality
administered
it?
justice
white
well,
it
did
administer
it,
did
it
not?
justice
white
and
nevertheless
it
could
administer
the
plan
without
going
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
white
i
am
not
sure
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
--
what
would
you
say
if
the
rule
should
be
under
section
5,
if
the
court
enters
a
declaratory
judgment,
a
reapportionment
plan
in
existence
is
unconstitutional
and
request
the
parties,
both
sides
to
submit
plans
and
suppose
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
has
been
in
court
defending
the
state
plan
and
he
goes
back
and
confers
with
his
legislative
colleagues
and
he
comes
back
to
the
court
with
plan
and
submits
it
as
the
states
official
suggestion
to
the
court
for
a
plan
and
the
other
party
of
course
comes
back
with
a
plan
too.
now,
the
court
has
requested
the
state
to
make
it
is
official
recommendation
of
the
court.
now,
what
is
your
rule
there?
does
connor
against
johnson
apply
or
waller?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
when,
not
when
there
is
a
--
the
legislature
is
not
about
to
meet
before
the
next
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
state
responds
in
the
example
of
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
were
talking
about,
respondent
submits
a
plan
and
the
court
says
“well,
there
is
some
good
parts
to
that,
but
some
good
parts
to
the
other
side
too
and
i
am
going
to
put
them
together
and
it
drafts
it
is
own
plan,
and
it
is
got
--
it
is
half
and
half,
half
state,
half
the
other
party.”
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
the
state
was
wholly
disqualified
from
even
submitting
the
plan
to
the
court
until
it
is
gone
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
states
order,
the
court’s
order
would
be
invalid
because
in
part
it
rested
on
a
state
--
in
part
of
a
state
profit
plan,
that
is
a
very
usual
situation,
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
--
the
congressional
report
is
the
report
to
which
you
refer
to
says
that
“where
the
district
court
directs
an
entity
to
adopt,
to
a
adopt
a
new
plan
and
present
it
to
the
court
for
consideration.”
now,
do
you
think
--
now
do
you
think
that
it
was
referring
to
just
a
business
of
a
--
the
attorney
general
and
to
request
of
the
court,
submitting
a
recommended
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
adopting
a
plan;
it
does
not
even
purport
to
adopt
a
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
are
suggesting
it,
it
sounds
like
when
a
declaratory
judgment
is
entered
the
attorney
general
should
retire
the
case
for
a
fear
of
poisoning
his
holding
decrees?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
part
of
it?
