william
j.
brennan,

it
do
not
really
mean
moot
in
there,
this
case
is
not
over?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
would
not
you
be
satisfied
if
this
case
were
back
before
the
district
court
on
a
connor
and
johnson
that
you
should
have
given
preference
to
single-member
districts
and
you
did
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
would
that
not
accomplish
everything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
our
disposition
last
--
what
was
connor
and
waller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
when
handled
summarily
last
june
or
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
cannot
you
recall
in
connor
and
waller
you
had
two
separate
acts,
one
of
the
upper
house
and
one
of
the
lower
house,
and
which
added
up
to
the
legislative
plan,
was
not
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
my
recollection
of
it
and
there
was
not
any
question
that
that
was
a
legislative
plan
and
yet
the
court
for
some
reason
held
it
was
not
covered
by
section
5
and
we
summarily
reversed
said
yes
the
legislative
change
like
that
was
indeed
a
section
5,
is
it
that
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
when
i
got
to
conner
and
waller
now,
and
indeed
what
we
held
there
was
that
district
court
erred
in
holding
that
house
bill
number
1290
and
senate
bill
number
2976,
mississippi
laws
1975,
regular
session,
are
not
legislative
enactments
required
to
be
submitted
pursuant
to
section
5
of
voting
rights
act.
so
there
was
not
any
question
there
that
we
had
statutes
of
the
state
legislature
of
mississippi.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
were
held
not
to
be
a
legislative
enactment
and
we
said
that
was
just
plain
wrong,
they
should
try
it
under
section
5,
but
i
do
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest
what
you
have
here
is
not
quite
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
you
cannot
talk
about
a
legislative
enactment
if
they
had
no
power
to
enact
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
is
in
a
situation
mr.
justice
white
posed,
the
attorney
general
has
been
party
to
litigation
and
a
litigation
has
resulted
in
invalidation
of
the
existing
legislative
reapportionment
plan
and
the
request
was
made
to
the
parties
to
submit
a
plan
and
the
attorney
general
says,
well,
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
plan,
try
this
one,
not
something
that
legislature
adopts,
but
something
that
he
formulates
and
he
submits
the
plan
and
that
plan
is
then
is
adopted
by
the
district
court,
is
that
a
--
is
that
wrong
under
johnson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
is
it
a
waller
situation
when
not
the
state
legislature,
but
the
attorney
general
formulates
and
submits
the
plan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
make
out
a
waller
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
by
court
that
you
say,
i
gather,
your
submission
is
that
a
district
judge
not
having
any
legislative
plan
to
propose
to
replace
an
invalidated
legislative
plan
can
formulate
his
own
and
not
require
--
where
pre-clearance
could
not
be
required
only
if
whatever
he
formulates
has
no
input
at
all
from
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
what
you
just
saying
--
