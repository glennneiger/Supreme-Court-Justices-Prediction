justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ward
while
we
are
talking
about
procedural
problems
here,
you
mentioned
in
your
brief,
at
least
if
i
read
it
correctly
that
there
has
been
change
in
the
relative
strength
of
the
black
versus
white
voting
population,
is
that
in
the
record
and
what
is
the
support
for
that
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
whole
case
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
start
over,
is
that
what
you
really
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
ward,
which
are
the
circumstances
we
should
base
that
decision
on,
an
assumption
that
the
blacks
outnumber
the
whites
or
the
whites
outnumber
the
blacks
in
the
voting
arena?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
factual
basis
on
which
you
want
us
to
make
that
decision?
if
it
is
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
it
might
be
one
decision
and
it
is
under
basis
what
you
tell
us
in
the
brief,
it
might
be
something
else?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
the
updating
should
be
done
in
this
court
rather
than
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
already
suggesting
is
that
the
district
judge
when
he
calls
for
somebody
to
submit
some
plans,
he
is
got
to
wait
until
â€“
until
dispose
of
this
case,
until
one
of
the
parties
has
its
wrestling
match
with
the
attorney
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
either
that
or
he
has
to
receive
the
plan
and
then
call
up
--
and
then
himself
ask
the
attorney
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
rejected
in
connor
against
johnson?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
did
not
know
section
5
--
i
did
not
know
section
5
replaced
all
of
the
reapportionment
litigation
in
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
only
where
what,
only
where
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
just
said
it
should
be
the
primary
mechanism
to
reapportionment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
where
it
does
it
exist,
that
is
the
question
right
here
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
suggesting
now
that
--
the
federal
district
judges
are
parties
to
circumventing
section
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
we
not
supposed
to
assume
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you
are
assuming
that
(voice

justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
and
if
they
do
not
know
what
is
going
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
or
the
other,
you
are
suggesting
is
they
are
doing
it
deliberately
or
ignorantly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you
would
also
concede
or
would
you
--
i
would
like
to
ask
you,
what
do
you
think
the
difference
between
the
section
5
standard
is
and
the
constitutional
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
can
understand
(voice
overlap)
i
can
understand
your
interest
in
wanting
to
--
them
under
section
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
will
not
permit
multi-member
districts
under
section
5,
if
there
is
any
kind
of
unidentifiable,
a
residential
pattern
of
living
in
the
community,
is
not
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
know
of
any
multi-member
districts
that
the
attorney
general
has
approved
under
section
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
about
to
find
one
either,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
question
is
on
--
question
is
on
which
certiorari
(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
suggest
to
do
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
like
a
jurisdictional
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
did.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
supposing
the
plaintiffs
submits
a
plan
and
the
defendant,
the
state
subdivision
files
a
memorandum
in
which
it
suggests
to
the
court
that
the
plan
have
certain
features
in
it.
could
such
a
memorandum
be
filed
without
submitting
to
the
u.s.
attorney
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
objecting
and
saying
we
think
the
plan
the
court
is
to
adopt
should
have
features
a,
b,
and
c
in
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
just
goes
to
the
form
of
the
submission
by
the
(voice
