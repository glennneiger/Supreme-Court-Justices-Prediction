justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
the
panel
decision
though
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
did
not
see
that
repeated
in
the
en
banc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
mr.
ward
that
indicates
one
way
or
the
other
whether
the
district
court’s
second
order
was
entered
with
or
without
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
along
that
same
line,
can
you
shed
any
light
on
whether
or
not
there
was
notice
in
the
hearing
in
connection
with
judge
dawkin's
order
of
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
while
it
was
an
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
a
connor
against
waller
case
by
definition,
it
is
not,
by
definition
it
could
not
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
mean
just
is
a
practical
matter,
but
as
a
legal
matter
it
is
not,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
a
police
jury
has
named
its
defendant
in
a
district
court
action
and
defense
and
they
hire
an
attorney
and
there
is
the,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
a
chairman
or
president
of
the
police
jury
in
a
committee
that
supervises
this
suit.
the
attorney
and
the
chairman,
the
police
jury
get
together.
the
court
has
asked
for
a
plan
and
the
chairman
and
attorney
together
say
“we
will
submit
this
plan.”
now,
surely
that
is
not
a
connor
against
waller
situation,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that
--
certainly
what
connor
against
waller
talks
about
is,
was
this
a
legislative
enactment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be
your
view
of
the
law
of
what
the
law
should
be,
but
certainly
connor
against
waller
spoke
in
terms
of
a
legislative
enactment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
court
drawing
it
is
own
plan.
now,
you
have
practiced
enough
and
i
think
i
have
practiced
that
before
i
went
to
the
bench
to
know
that
there
are
very,
very
few
judges
who
sit
down
without
any
advise
from
counsel
on
either
side
and
ponder
the
whole
thing
through
and
come
up
something
that
was
never
suggested
to
them
by
a
lawyer,
do
you
not
agree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
absence
of
a
special
master,
i
do
not
mean
just
in
a
case
like
this,
but
in
any
of
case,
the
judge
gets
at
least
his
idea,
if
not
the
findings
that
he
actually
signs
from
one
of
the
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ordinarily,
though
we
do
not
even
let
one
of
the
parties
argue
an
issue
that
was
not
read
or
raised
in
the
questions
presented
in
a
certiorari
--
here
you
are
amicus
and
you
are
seeking
to
alter
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
district
court
here,
mr.
landsberg,
had
done
just
what
it
did,
but
there
had
been
no
appeal
taken
from
it
is
judgment
and
then
it
became
final,
would
you
still
say
that
there
was
a
litigatable
violation
of
section
5?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
circuit
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
district
court
judgment
is
final?
