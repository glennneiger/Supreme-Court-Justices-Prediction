mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
provides
in
relevant
part
that
whenever
a
state
and
it
is
set
forth
on
beginning
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
that
whenever
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision
with
respect
to
which
the
prohibition
is
set
forth
in
section
4(a)
are
in
effect,
shall
enact
or
seek
to
administer
any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting
or
standard
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
enforced
or
effect
on
november
1,
1964,
then
that
state
or
political
subdivision
must
comply
with
the
pre-clearance
provisions
of
section
5
either
by
bringing
a
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
seeking
approval
of
the
change
as
not
having
a
discriminatory
perpetual
effect
or
by
submitting
the
change
to
the
attorney
general.
if
it
is
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
has
not
interposed
an
objection
within
60
days
then
the
state
or
political
subdivision
may
enforce
the
change.
now,
the
question
today,
i
suppose
is
whether
the
words
“seek
to
administer”
which
are
found
in
the
first
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
no.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
judicial
administration
which
if
we
are
correct
in
our
position
that
the
courts
below
should
not
have
considered
the
plans
submitted
to
them
prior
to
pre-clearance
then
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
but
of
a
primary
jurisdiction
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
your
honor
this
court
has
on
its
own
raised
questions
where
it
felt
that
principles
judicial
administration
required
the
court
to
do
so.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
as
an
amicus
we
are,
i
suppose
suggesting
that
this
court
should
do
it
and
it
is
an
issue
which
has
been
briefed.
it
is
an
issue
which
has
been
addressed
in
oral
argument.
this
court
has
the
authority
to
decide
it.
it
is
also
an
alternative
ground
for
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
sending
the
case
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well,
i
think
that
is
the
question
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
because
i
do
not
believe
that
it
does.
there
are
two
cases;
neither
case
is
an
interpretation
of
the
words
“seek
to
administer.”
the
first
case,
connor
v.
johnson
held
that
a
decree
of
a
district
court
was
not
subject
to
review
by
the
attorney
general.
in
that
case
the
district
court
had
formulated
it
is
own
plan
because
the
jurisdiction
involved
had
failed
to
present
an
acceptable
plan
that
met
fourteenth
amendment
standards.
so
the
court
properly
held
that
under
section
5
this
court
ordered
plan
was
not
a
plan
which
had
been
enacted
by
the
jurisdiction
and
it
was
not
a
plan
which
the
jurisdiction
sought
to
administer.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
it
was
required
to.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
it
did
administer
it.
it
was
under
order
to
administer
it.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
that
is
what
this
court
held
and
we
have
no
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
no.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
congress
in
reenacting
the
voting
rights
act
in
1975
cited
this
court's
decision
in
connor
v.
johnson
with
approval
as
expressing
the
will
of
congress.
congress
also
was
of
the
view
and
the
legislative
history
is
set
forth
on
pages
18
to
20
of
our
brief
that
section
5
would
apply
to
situations
such
as
this.
this
is
not
a
case
where
it
was
necessary
for
a
decision
of
a
district
court
to
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
the
proper
course
for
the
district
court
here
would
have
been
to
defer
ruling
on
the
case
until
the
jurisdiction
had
complied
with
the
provisions
of
section
5.
we
think
that
is
what
this
court
said
that
the
state
of
mississippi
should
have
done
in
connor
versus
waller.
now,
the
difference
between
this
case
in
connor
versus
waller
is
in
connor
versus
waller
there
was
an
enactment.
here
it
is
arguable
at
least
with
respect
to
the
police
jury
that
there
was
not
an
enactment
because
of
the
invalidity
of
the
state
law
providing
for
the
enabling
statute
allowing
at-large
elections.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well,
it
has
been
--
it
has
been
held
that
there
is
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia,
sir.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
yes.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
yes
and
we
would
prefer
to
avoid
that
situation
where
the
attorney
general
is
called
upon
a
required
to
review
a
statute
which
the
district
court
has
already
approved.
we
think
that
the
procedure
that
we
are
suggesting
would
avoid
that
result.
the
differences
between
connor
v.
waller
and
this
case
are
perhaps
twofold.
in
connor
v.
waller
there
was
not
a
court
order
to
submit
the
change
to
the
court,
the
legislature.
the
court,
however,
under
established
practices
in
reapportionment
cases
generally
gave
the
legislature
an
opportunity
to
enact
a
new
reapportionment
plan.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
waller.
it
would
be
a
plan
which
the
jurisdiction
of
seeking
the
courts
approval
and
is
there
by
seeking
to
administer.
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
the
ordinary
way
in
which
a
reapportionment
case
would
be
handled.
ordinarily
the
court
would
first
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
i
think
that
ordinarily
the
court
would
first
ask
or
give
the
opportunity
for
the
state
or
political
subdivision
to
formulate
a
plan.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well
if
we
are
in
an
emergency
type
situation
that
is
true.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
that
is
true.
in
connor
v.
waller
there
was
an
emergency
type
situation.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
we
think
it
is
wrong
under
the
voting
rights
act.
i
do
not
think
that
johnson
speaks
to
it.
i
think
that
the
situation
that
johnson
speaks
to
is
where
the
court
has
formally
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
it
is
an
attempt
by
the
state
in
the
person
of
it
is
counsel
to
administer
a
change.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
yes,
and
i
think
that
that
if
one
looks
at
the
purpose
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
situation
which
led
to
it
is
enactment
that
the
procedures
of
the
voting
rights
act
were
intended
to
apply
not
just
to
actions
which
the
state
took
legislatively,
but
also
to
voting
practices
which
might
be
imposed
without
the
authority
of
state
law
perhaps
by
local
officials
or
by
local
police
juries
or
school
boards.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
that
is
right.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
but
the
court
should
not
rely
on
the
state's
plan
until
that
plan
has
been
pre-cleared,
that
is
what
--
i
think
congress
very
clearly
stated
in
saying
that
section
5
is
intended
to
establish,
this
is
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
a
form
of
primary
jurisdiction
for
section
5
review
under
which
courts
dealing
with
voting
discrimination
issues
should
defer
in
the
first
instance
to
the
attorney
general
or
to
the
district
of
columbia
district
court.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
no,
i
would
not
think
we
would
go
that
far,
i
think
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
no,
i
think
that
when
the
plaintiff
presents
a
plan,
certainly
the
state
would
as
a
party
to
the
case
have
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
any
proposals
that
were
made.
if
this
court
were
to
appoint
a
special
master
the
same
would
be
true.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
i
think
that
it
would
cover
that
as
well.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well,
we
get
the
situation
and
in
this
case
we
have
two
sets
of
resolutions,
one
of
which
says
the
school
board
and
police
jury
adopt
reapportionment
plan
and
then
the
next
time
a
resolution
is
passed
by
the
police
jury
and
the
school
board
saying
“we
propose
this
plan.”
well,
it
was
not
formally
adopted,
but
the
effect
of
what
they
are
trying
to
do
in
both
situations
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
i
think
that
can
only
be
done
as
i
understand
this
court’s
decisions
where
there
is
some
sort
of
an
emergency
situation
it
has
been
unable
to
get
an
acceptable
plan
from
the
jurisdiction.
in
the
ordinary
case
as
in
this
case
there
was
a
period
of
four
months
between
the
submission
of
the
plan
and
the
trial
on
the
plan,
there
was
ample
opportunity
for
the
political
jurisdiction
to
submit
the
plan
to
the
attorney
general
for
his
review
in
the
interim.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
input.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well,
he
is,
but
he
is
also
an
officer
of
the
state
and
counsel
for
the
state
and
is
representing
the
state
in
seeking
to
--
permission
to
administer
the
plan.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
a
memorandum
in
effect
objecting
to
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
a
close
case.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
what
i
am
trying
to
suggest
that
it
ought
not
to
be
governed
by
the
forum.
it
ought
to
be
governed
by
what
the
submission
really
is.
in
whatever
form
it
is
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
administer
a
particular
voting
change
and
that
congress
has
said
must
be
subjected
to
the
provisions
of
section
5.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well,
that
would
--
we
are
talking
about
the
unusual
situation
where
the
--
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
the
state
may
comment
on
what
(voice
overlap)
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
the
court
may
look
to
the
state
for
comments
on
what
the
other
parties
have
submitted.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
well
there
again,
i
think
we
are
getting
into
a
close
area
where
one
would
have
to
look
at
the
actual
document
that
has
been
filed.
mr.
brian
k.
landsberg
i
think
not.
i
think
that,
what
the
structure
of
the
act
is
intended
to
provide
as
if
the
attorney
general
would
submit
it
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
who
in
most
instances
has
approved
plans.
if
the
attorney
general
disapproves
the
plan
and
the
state
should
have
an
opportunity
to
formulate
a
new
one.
