mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
requested
the
marshall
to
notify
as
i
would
like
to
save
a
little
time
for
a
rebuttal
and
view
of
the
solicitor
general
being
permitted
to
participate
in
oral
argument
and
brief
along
with
one
additional
amicus
curiae.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
before
getting
to
the
discussion
of
the
issues,
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case,
i
dig
two
points
[voice
overlap]
to
consider
and
keep
in
mind
while
you
are
considering
the
issues
and
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case.
one;
east
carroll
parish
is
in
north
west
louisiana,
a
small
rural
parish.
in
louisiana,
our
law
requires
the
districts
attorneys
in
our
state
to
represent
the
local
governmental
units
in
their
districts
such
as
school
boards
and
police
juries.
often
times
a
district
attorney
will
have
three
parishes
in
his
district
which
gives
him
three
school
boards,
three
police
juries
to
advice.
of
course
he
is
primarily
a
county
prosecutor.
criminal
law;
our
district
attorneys
are
generally
understaffed
and
overworked
and
their
assistants,
the
view
that
they
have
are
trained
primarily
in
criminal
law.
but
we
do
not
have
for
our
school
boards
unfortunately
and
our
police
juries
a
battery
of
lawyers
such
as
the
solicitor
general
and
justice
department
have,
or
the
lawyers
committed
to
civil
rights
under
the
law
or
even
lawyers
with
the
expertise
and
knowledge
in
constitutional
law
that
mr.
halpin
has
from
the
many
cases
he
has
handled
with
the
ac,
american
civil
liberties
union.
i
say
that
not
to
present
a
david
and
goliath
type
picture,
but
merely
so
that
the
court
will
understand
that
back
in
1971,
68
to
71
when
this
was
in
--
the
case
was
in
the
district
court,
that
school
board
and
police
jury
was
relying
on
the
advice
of
an
assistant
district
attorney
who
really
had
not
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
this
area
of
the
law.
and
also,
the
second
point,
this
particular
area
of
the
law
was
constantly
changing.
it
was
virtually
impossible,
really,
for
lay
police
jury
members
and
lay
school
board
members
to
know
from
day
to
day
what
the
law
really
was
with
regard
to
reapportionment.
it
was
not
until
really
your
averred
decision
that
when
you
reply
to
local
political
subdivisions
as
well
as
congressional
districts
and
state
legislators.
at
that
time
in
'68,
we
tried
to
anticipate
the
problem
of
reapportionment
and
assist
these
school
boards
as
the
brace
of
all
three,
the
respondent,
the
solicitor
general
and
amicus
curiae
point
out.
the
louisiana
legislature
in
1968
adopted
a
law
which
would
permit
school
boards
to
reapportion
themselves,
that
was
act
561.
a
similar
and
not
seminar
law,
but
to
the
same
effect
was
suggested
by
the
police
juries,
act
445.
it
is
animated
and
the
plaintiffs
--
respondent’s
brief
and
the
government's
brief
that
because
in
prior
years
the
school
board
members
and
the
police
jury
members
had
been
elected
from
wards
within
a
parish.
that
when
the
legislature
switched
to
a
reapportionment
plan
which
would
permit
at-large
districts
that
there
was
some
invidious
motive
in
switching
from
single
member
districts,
if
you
could
call
our
police
jury
ward
single-member
district,
they
really
were
not,
because
some
of
them
were
multi-member.
but
the
switch-in
from
that
system
to
a
possible
permissive
at-large
system
was
designed
to
discriminate
against
black
citizens
and
to
deny
them
the
right
to
vote
and
the
right
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process.
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
for
the
school
boards
association,
the
louisiana
school
boards
association
which
is
a
non-profit
advisory
service
type
organization
which
i
happen
to
represent,
i
drafted
the
legislation
or
the
school
boards
that
the
legislature
adopted,
act
561.
it
was
slightly
amended
in
the
legislature,
but
basically
we
were
lucky
and
it
came
through
pretty
much
in
as
it
went
in.
we
never
considered
once,
the
possibility
of
that
at-large
feature,
permissive
at-large
feature
being
used
to
discriminate
a
back
against
black
citizens
or
to
dilute
their
vote.
we
simply
wanted
to
give
our
school
boards
as
much
latitude
as
possible
in
trying
to
devise
the
best
plan
that
they
could
to
help
them
provide
the
best
possible
education
system
they
could
in
their
parish.
the
attorney
general
of
our
state,
somewhat
delays,
submitted
those
two
acts
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
as
required
by
the
voting
rights
act.
he
entered
an
objection
due
to
the
at-large
feature.
we
spent,
myself
and
mr.
james
prescott
who
was
executive
secretary
of
the
louisiana
school
boards
association
about
two
years
with
numerous
phone
calls
and
correspondents
trying
to
convince
the
attorney
general
that
since
that
the
at-large
feature
was
permissive
and
since
the
voting
rights
act
would
require
submission
of
local
governmental
units
reapportionment
plans
to
him,
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
object
to
the
state
legislation
and
not
only
that,
but
because
of
his
objection
we
now
find
that
some
school
boards,
i
say
them
particularly
because
i
represent
them
more
than
i
do
police
juries,
could
not
reapportion
because
of
the
inoperativeness
of
the
state
legislation.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct,
it
did
not
mandate
at-large
district,
it
made
it
permissive.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
police
jury
act
was
much
shorter.
it
is
simply
repealed
a
lot
of
the
statutes
tying
police
juries
to
wards
whereas
our
act
went
into
more
detail,
limited
the
smallness
and
the
maximum
size
of
the
board
within
their
discretion,
permitted
single
member
districts
or
at-large
districts.
as
probably
it
just
as
part
of
the
one
reason
for
that
was
that
school
boards
had
been
tied
to
police
juries’
historically.
simply
we
like
same
school
board
members,
and
same
wards
elect,
police
juries
and
the
school
boards
have
wanted
to
get
away
from
that
for
many
years
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
generally
speaking,
justice
powell,
i
would
say
yes.
[voice
overlap]
building
roads
and
drainage
that
is
--
that
kind
of
thing?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
it
is
the
only
governing
body
in
the
parish
except
for
the
school
board
which
has
complete
and
sole
jurisdiction
over
the
school
system
for
the
parish
and
any
town
council
which
may
be
in
a
town
or
village.
it
is
the
sole
building
part
of
a
parish
government
but
as
i
was
saying
school
board
functions
and
police
jury
functions
are
so
totally
different
that
we
had
long
wanted
to
get
away
from
being
tied
to
the
police
juries.
there
is
no
reason
why
school
board
members
should
be
elected
from
the
same
district
that
police
jury
members
are.
we
have
perish
wise
school
systems
and
it
did
not
make
it
--
it
is
not
important
whether
this
man
gets
a
school
built
in
his
district
as
compared
to
this
man
over
here,
is
do
you
get
the
right
kind
of
school
bills
throughout
the
parish
to
provide
the
best
education.
we
ultimate
were
successful
in
getting
the
attorney
general,
convincing
him
that
he
could
withdraw
his
objection
to
the
permissive
legislation
which
he
did
in
'72
after
this
case
had
gone
through
the
district
court.
now,
when
it
was
before
the
district
court
originally,
it
was
on
a
suit
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
grounds
of
one
man,
one
vote
in
'68.
of
course
an
at-large
system
meets
one
man,
one
vote
requirement
perfectly
with
zero
deviation.
when
1970
rolled
around,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
plan
was
approved
by
the
district
court,
there
was
no
appeal
taken
and
really
it
is
sort
of
a
res
judicata.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
same
residential
requirements
meeting
that
wards.
in
1970,
however
the
district
court
on
its
own
motion
requested
the
board
and
police
jury
to
either
file
a
new
plan
or
at
least
file
updated
statistics
based
on
the
1970
census
which
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
district
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir.
not
specifically.
i
did
not
believe
if
you
--
the
appendix
indicates
that
he
retained
jurisdiction
from
his
--
he
may
have,
you
are
correct
to
that
one.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
right
that
is
prior
to
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
required
them
to
update,
they
did
simply
by
filing
the
same
plan,
the
'70
census
figures
did
not
affect
the
one
man,
one
vote
because
it
was
an
at-large
system.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
at
that
point
the
present
intervene
respondent,
intervened
mr.
marshall
and
complaining
of
fifteenth
amendment
discrimination
and
dilution
of
the
black
vote.
the
district
court
held
a
hearing
in
july
of
1971
in
which
the
plaintiffs,
the
intervene
here
marshall
put
on
the
evidence
to
the
effect
that
you
had
a
history
of
segregated
school
system
in
east
carroll
parish
that
you
--
federal
registrars
had
registered
--
black
people
had
to
come
in
and
register
black
voters,
the
usual
effect
of
that
obsolete,
hopefully,
obsolete
history
of
our
past
as
to
practices
which
we
now
regret.
however,
in
this
particular
parish
at
that
time
even,
black
citizens
constitute
about
58%
of
the
total
population
in
the
parish.
at
that
time
they
were
54
or
45%
approximately
of
the
registered
voters
in
the
parish.
i
do
not
know
what
the
eligible
voting
age
figures
would
be,
i
do
not
have
those.
the
district
court
concluded
in
its
order
of
august
'71,
set
down
seven
points,
four
of
which
as
i
recall
related
directly
to
whether
or
not
this
plan
discriminated
against
the
black
citizens
of
east
carroll
parish.
he
found
that
it
did
not.
that
they
were
majority
in
population,
that
the
plan
was
accruable
on
one
man,
one
vote
since
it
was
at-large
and
he
approved
that
plan.
the
intervener
noticed
an
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
final
decision
affirmed
the
district
court,
two
to
one.
an
application
for
rehearing
was
filed
and
granted
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
they
reheard
the
case
en
banc,
en
banc
as
we
say
in
louisiana
and
by
a
nine
to
six
split
decision
reserved
the
district
court
finding
that
due
to
the
fact
that
black
citizens
in
east
carroll
parish
who
were
at
that
time
only
54%
or
45%
of
the
registered
voters,
regardless
of
the
question
of
how
many
were
eligible
to
register,
of
age
to
register,
that,
that
was
sufficient
to
dilute
the
minority
vote.
even
though
the
black
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
constitutional,
yes
sir,
that
was
a
constitutional
holding
based
primarily
on
white
versus
registered.
there
were
six
dissents,
six
dissenting
opinions
to
the
effect
that
population
is
the
proper
criteria
not
registered
voters
and
that
--
because
of
population
majority,
there
was
no
way
that
an
at-large
plan
could
discriminate
against
that
majority.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
may
have
partially
beg
ignorance
your
honor,
i
did
not
represent
the
petitioner
either
at
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
did
say
it
in
connor
versus
johnson
that
when
a
court
fashions
a
plan,
it
may
not
have
been
connor
versus
johnson,
that
it
should
prefer
single
member
districts
although
i
do
still
--
i
do
not
yet
understand
that
preference.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
--
his
answer
to
that
was
that
if
the
issue
was
raised
at
the
district
court
level
that
--
regardless
of
that
preference
and
if
there
was
proof
that
the
other
plan
was
unconstitutional,
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
draw
a
single
member
district
plan.
he
did
not
actually
draw
this
plan.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
well,
that
is
a
contention
in
this
suit.
now
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
court
ordered
the
police
jury
and
the
school
board
to
adopt.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
and
submit
to
it
a
plan,
which
they
did.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
and
he
accepted
their
plan
as
being
as
constitutional.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
there
would
be
a
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
if
you
go
purely
technically
at
the
time
this
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
the
attorney
general’s
objection
to
the
permissive
legislation
was
still
in
effect
and
had
not
--
it
was
not
withdrawn
until
'72,
so
those
state
statutes
were
no
in
effect?
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
would
be
correct
and
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
the
court
approved
the
plan
as
being
constitutional
over
the
objections
that
it
is
discriminating.
now,
of
course
single
member
districts
and
multi
member
districts,
you
can
draw
reapportionment
plans
just
like
a
pie,
you
have
got
all
sorts
of
different
kind
of
slices
depending
on
who
is
got
the
knife.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
it
was
raised
your
honor.
there
was
not
a
great
deal
on
how
it
made
of
it
that
i
can
find
either
at
the
district
court
level
or
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
that
once
the
case
was
on
appeal,
the
district
court
no
longer
had
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
new
order.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
the
en
banc
as
i
recall
--
if
they
have
mentioned
it
all;
it
was
barely
in
passing
because
they
have
decided
apparently
that
they
were
going
to
reverse
the
at-large
plan,
so
really
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
particularly
consider
that
question.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
but
does
a
district
court
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
orders
once
the
case
is
on
appeal.
are
there
--
can
he
cut
out
the
chance
to
hear
the
issue
on
appeal
when
it
is
already
been
appealed
and
another
thing
that
this
was
ex-partie
order,
issued
without
hearing,
without
notice
to
the
defendant
political
subdivision
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
on
all
the
rules
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
apparently
somebody
convinced
him
without
a
hearing
or
anything
that
perhaps
the
state
of
decisions
that
have
come
down
since
the
original
order
commanded
single-member
districts.
if
that
is
the
law,
it
certainly
should
not
be
the
law
because
single-member
district
can
be
just
as
a
discriminatory
as
at-large
and
multi-member
districts.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
you
will
not
find
a
new
motion
[voice
overlap]
in
the
record
after
the
original
complaint
was
filed.
in
his
brief
he
attaches
the
order
of
the
court,
but
he
does
not
attach
any
new
motion
or
is
there
any
in
the
record
that
i
was
able
to
find
or
any
notice
of
the
hearing
to
be
set
and
according
to
the
information
given
me
by
the
then
assistant
district
attorney
who
was
handling
it,
nobody
knew
about
it
till
in
it
was
issued.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
your
honor
as
i
recall
the
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
all
it
says,
i
willl
read
the
very
beginning
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
am
reading
from
respondent's
brief,
page
1aa
of
appendix.
if
the
order
itself,
this
is
the
order
of
'72,
march
27,
1972
commences
by
saying
on
august
7,
1971,
this
court
entered
an
order
approving
at-large
parish
while
the
elections
for
the
police
juries,
school
board
of
east
carroll
parish.
subsequent
decisions,
particularly
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
have
convinced
this
court
that
at-large
elections
for
a
parish
with
a
sizable
black
population
and
a
history
of
denial
of
vote
to
black
citizens
is
constitutionally
impermissible
and
as
allowed
by
the
louisiana
statutory
authority.
having
received
the
various
alternative
plans
proposed
by
plaintiff
intervener
and
defendants
at
the
july
29,
1971
hearing,
the
court
finds
that
the
nine
member
plan
of
plaintiffs
is
the
best.
no
indication
at
all
of
any
further
motion
by
the
intervener
or
any
notice
to
their
respondent
or
defendant
public
bodies,
a
chance
to
defend
against
that
viewpoint
which
we
submit
as
incorrect,
both
procedural
and
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
my
authority
for
that
change
in
registered
voters
comes
from
a
letter
from
the
registrar
of
voters
as
i
requested
him
to
let
me
know
what
was
his
registration.
now,
those
figures
are
accurate,
they
are
not
in
the
record.
the
record
would
have
to
be
supplemented
and
i
inquired
of
the
clerk
after
filing
my
petition,
if
it
would
be
proper
to
do
so
and
he
indicated
that
at
the
time
he
did
not
--
just
helping
out
fact
that
these
are
one
of
those
cases
that
cannot
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
just
old
stayed
facts
in
1971
like
maybe
an
automobile
accident
can
be
decided.
the
law
changes
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
no
sir,
i
am
saying
i
do
not
think
you
should.
i
think
you
can
decide
this
case
on
the
merits
even
if
the
government's
position
as
to
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
correct
and
should
be
applied
in
other
cases,
there
would
be
real
point
in
sending
this
case
as
it
stands
before
you
now,
back
to
the
district
court
and
put
these
two
bodies
though
all
of
the
expense
of
going
to
the
attorney
general
under
section
5,
then
possibly
having
to
go
to
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
get
a
ruling
if
the
attorney
general’s
ruling
is
adverse.
i
think
the
attorney
general
may
also
need
some
direction
from
this
court
as
to
is
at-large
system
under
these
kind
of
circumstances
constitutionally
impermissible.
presumably
if
you
deny
he
may
in
his
consideration,
if
it
went
back
to
the
district
court
and
through
the
attorney
general
under
section
5,
say
is
constitutionally
impermissible
and
he
will
come
right
back
to
this
court
again
because
it
just
does
not
seem
conceivable
to
me
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
the
respondent
here,
the
complainant
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
think
on
the
basis
that
i
think
if
there
is
a
problem
with
doing
it
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
the
court
should
permit
the
record
to
be
updated
with
regard
to
the
present
facts
as
to
--
[voice
overlap]
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
in
the
essence
of
time,
i
would
say
yes,
your
honor.
if
it
must
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
that
then
let
it
go
back
for
that
limited
purpose,
but
even
the
district
court
is
going
to
need
some
direction
from
this
court
as
to,
if
the
facts
are
this
what
is
the
law,
if
the
facts
are
what
is
the
law.
are
there
now
more
registered
black
voters
in
the
east
carroll
parish,
then
why,
and
is
the
population
58,
still
58%
black
and
if
it
is,
then
is
this
at-large
plan
constitutional?
i
think
the
district
court
will
need
to
know
because
i
do
not
believe
he
knows
now,
whether
it
is
or
whether
it
is
not.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
but
you
have
to
make
the
decision
as
to
what
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
well,
as
to
those
facts,
if
you
want
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
or
to
permit
to
us
to
supplement
the
record
with
the
exact
facts,
that
may
be
the
proper
thing
to
do.
it
is
a
long
time
and
a
lot
of
expense
for
this
--
to
local
government
units
who
do
not
have
a
great
deal
of
money.
they
are
not
--
local
governments
are
not
very
rich,
particularly
in
smaller
rural
parishes.
i
would
like
to
perhaps
conclude
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
--
by
saying,
i
do
not
necessarily
disagree
with
government’s
position
as
to
the
use
of
section
5
and
that
plans
should
be
submitted.
the
law
of
section
5
has
changed
so
much
since
the
voting
rights
act
was
first
adopted.
in
1965,
the
only
newspaper
publicity
was
about
reading
more
--
to
read
the
constitution
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
was
not
really
until
about
1969
or
70
that
we
begin
to
realize,
that
is
in
the
local
government
area,
that
this
section
5
is
back
there,
that
everything
we
do
must
be
submitted
to
the
attorney
general.
we
relocate
a
polling
place
in
somebody’s
grocery
store
and
he
says
“i
am
tried
of
putting
up
with
this,”
go
find
yourself
another
polling
place,
we
do
that,
it
must
be
submitted.
it
is
a
problem,
but
i
have
submitted
plans
to
the
justice
department
under
section
5
and
have
had
them
approved,
all
single-member
districts,
all
multi-member
districts
and
combination.
and
that
does
not
bother
me,
having
to
come
all
the
way
to
washington,
d.c.
and
bring
witnesses
in
order
to
try
to
defend
myself
in
the
d.c.
district
court.
that
is
another
problem,
of
course
congress
did
it,
i
do
not
know
that
you
could
do
much
about
it,
unless
it
is
discriminatory
against
the
states
for
depriving
them
of
the
normal
judicial
procedure
of
their
local
district
judges.
there
seem
to
be
some
indication
that
perhaps
congress
did
not
trust
our
local
district
judges.
i
find
them
--
mr.
halpin
wins
as
many
cases
on
one
side
as
i
do
on
the
other
side,
so
they
do
a
pretty
good
job,
but
perhaps
that
is
a
way
to
take
a
burden
off
of
the
court
system
by
requiring
it
to
go
to
section
5.
in
other
cases,
even
though
a
suit
has
been
filed,
and
our
problem
back
in
'71,
particularly
with
connor
versus
johnson,
we
did
not
know
how
far
connor
versus
johnson
went
and
suits
were
being
filed
and
the
district
attorneys
relied
on
their
district
judges
and
the
district
judges'
docket
is
not
the
only
one
interpreted
connor
versus
johnson
to
apply
even
when
he
did
not
devise
the
plan
himself,
but
had
compelled
the
plan,
through
a
court
order
directed
the
legislative
body
to
submit
a
plan
to
him.
i
think
you
can
decide
the
merits
of
this
case
under
these
circumstances
on
the
merits
and
hold
this
at-large
plan
as
being
constitutionally
permissible
under
these
circumstances
and
make
an
alternative
decision
on
--
as
to
other
cases
under
the
section
5
position
of
the
government.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
i
will
be
very
brief
your
honor.
i
have
somewhat
the
same
problem
with
the
section
5
argument
that
justice
white
has
raised.
on
the
one
hand
the
government
says
if
the
court
finds
a
body
of
malapportioned,
orders
it
to
submit
a
plan,
it
submits
a
plan
under
a
lawsuit
filed
by
plaintiff,
plaintiffs
submit
is
a
plan,
so
you
have
an
intervener
also
submits
a
plan,
if
the
court
chooses
the
plan
submitted
by
the
political
subdivision
it
is
subject
to
section
5
review.
if
it
chooses
--
mr.
john
f.
ward,
jr.
or
any
part
of
it.
it
chooses
on
the
other
hand
the
plaintiff's
plan
as
being
the
best
the
plan,
it
is
not
subject
to
section
5
review.
the
same
would
be
true
with
the
intervener
plan
which
begs,
it
seems
to
me
to
beg
the
question
one
time,
one
plan
that
just
took
the
voting
rights
act
requires
clearance
by
the
attorney
general.
another
plan
doing
--
having
the
same
effect
or
different
effect,
but
in
the
same
purpose
is
not
subject
to
pre-clearance.
this
case,
i
think
you
can
decide
on
its
facts
even
on
the
record
before
you
without
the
update.
that
the--
although
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
held,
which
reversed
the
district
court
and
held
that
an
at-large
plan
discriminates
against
blacks
where
blacks
are
in
a
majority
in
population,
but
slightly
less
than
a
majority
in
registered
voters,
it
is
not
accord
with
your
previous
decisions
in
white
v.
regester,
it
is
arguing
over
a
minimal
difference.
for
example,
the
voter
registration
figures,
at
that
time,
3,342
white,
2,899
black,
a
443
more
white
registered
voters
than
black.
my
figures
as
of,
when
i
filed
my
brief,
new
figures
with
3,550
white,
black
rather,
3,533
or
a
17
more
black
registered
voters.
if
you
went
to
the
registered
democrats
because
in
my
state
we
are
almost
a
one
party
system
unfortunately,
the
difference
will
be
considerably
greater
in
number
of
more
blacks
registered
than
white.
but
when
you
go
to
mr.
halpin’s
figure
which
he
says
he
got
by
telephone
call
from
the
registrar,
it
shows
as
now
more
white
registered
voters
than
black,
but
again
the
difference
of
only
242
between
17
to
242
to
443,
that
is
such
a
minimal
difference
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
and
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
that
makes
an
at-large
plan
constitutionally
impermissible,
that
slight
difference.
when
a
parish
with
a
majority
population
like
this,
black
and
white,
pretty
near
equal,
55-58%
black
registered
voters
are
going
to
vary
from
year
to
year
depending
on
age
of
children
for
one
thing.
another
thing
that
i
think
that
you
must
remember,
before
the
court
of
appeals,
this
plan
in
effect,
blacks
have
been
elected
to
the
school
board
and
have
been
elected
to
the
police
jury.
i
might
direct
your
attention
to
the
appendix
at
pages
119
through
121
i
believe
in
which
a
number
of
the
police
jury
is
questioned
during
the
hearing
in
july
of
'71.
as
to
the
town
of
lake
providence
and
which
is
the
only
large
town
in
the
parish
and
is
questioned
as
to
the
black
population
being
virtually
almost
two
to
one,
greater
than
white,
he
testifies
also
that
part
of
their
past
history,
no
black
had
ever
been
elected
as
alderman
in
the
town
of
lake
providence
even
though
they
were
on
at-large
and
the
black
majority
is
almost
two
to
one.
but
today
gentleman
all
five
alderman
are
black.
the
mayor
of
the
town
is
black.
the
respondent
himself
who
was
previously
defeated
for
the
office
of
city
marshall
has
now
been
elected
city
marshall
and
is
city
marshall
today.
i
respectfully
submit
to
you
that
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case,
this
plan
is
not
unconstitutional.
the
fifth
circuit;s
en
banc
decision
should
be
reversed
and
the
district
court’s
original
order
implementing
this
at-large
system
should
be
approved.
thank
you.
