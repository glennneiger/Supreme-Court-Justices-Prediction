chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
1542,
union
electric
company
against
the
environmental
protection
agency.
mr.
ferrell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
mr.
ferrell
that
none
of
these
of
factors
could
have
been
anticipated
in
time
for
a
different
type
of
review?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
ferrell.
mr.
taft.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
if
you
will
agree
with
your
friend
that
there
are
no
circumstances
under
which
a
plant
like
this
can
be
closed
as
it
might
be
true
in
some
other
types
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
ultimate
solution
then,
mr.
taft?
suppose,
it
finally
occurs
that
is
accompanied,
the
utilities
are
conflict
to
financing
with
this
without
drastic
rate
structure
and
suppose
they
cannot
satisfy
the
rate
making
authority,
that
does
mean
the
federal
district
court
or
the
epa
must
take
over
the
operation
of
the
plant
until
standards
are
met?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
can
reconcile
that
with
your
footnote
on
the
bottom
page
36,
mr.
taft.
the
last
full
paragraph
of
the
footnote
where
you
say
it
is
the
administratorâ€™s
duty
however
that
claims
of
infeasibility
are
not
relevant
to
whether
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
implementation
program.
some
claims
in
other
words
may
not
be
used
to
render
invalid
the
emission
limitations
and
so
forth.
now,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that.
does
that
mean
that
a
district
court
cannot
make
some
adjustment
in
light
of
the
intervening
events
or
events
subsequent
to
the
three-year
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happens,
mr.
taft,
if
the
state
runs
a
variance
which
the
epa
does
not
agree
with
or
approve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
who
decides
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
i
am
proposing
a
confrontation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
the
sanctions
done
against
the
state
or
against
the
utility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
meanwhile
the
utilities
must
be
a
little
bit
uncertainty,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
ferrell
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
in
74-1542
union
electric
company
against
environmental
protection
agency
and
75-260
mcdonald
against
santa
fe
transportation
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
