mr.
peter
r.
taft
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
question
has
been
well
presented
here.
primarily
we
are
concerned
with
whether
or
not
in
approval
of
the
state
air
implementation
plan,
the
epa
must
consider
the
economic
and
technological
feasibility
of
the
plan
before
approving
it.
the
court
below
said
no.
they
said
no
at
anytime
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
30
days,
within
30
days
or
after.
we
agree.
we
believe
that
from
the
face
of
the
statute
that
is
clear.
we
believe
from
the
history
of
it
is
clear
and
also
from
its
structure.
if
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear
on
pollution
control
law
when
you
go
to
congress,
it
is
technology
and
economics
and
the
water
pollution
control
act,
it
is
a
technology
act.
under
section
301,
they
refer
to
for
77
to
the
best
practicable
control
technology
available.
for
83,
they
refer
to
the
best
available
technology,
economically
achievable.
in
the
clean
air
act,
it
comes
up
again
and
again.
it
comes
up
with
respect
to
technology.
it
is
relevant
to
air
craft.
it
is
relevant
to
fuels,
to
motor
vehicles,
to
new
source
performance
standards
and
section
110
itself
twice
brings
technology
into
play,
in
section
110
(e)
and
section
110
(f).
so
that
i
think
that
when
the
standards
are
set
forth
in
section
110
(a)
(2)
as
to
what
the
epa
shall
review
when
it
reviews
a
plan,
it
sets
eight
of
them
out
and
when
it
chooses
to
omit
technology
and
economics,
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
that
choice
by
congress
was
clear
and
intentional.
in
fact,
when
you
go
to
the
history
of
the
act,
it
is
even
more
clear,
set
forth
well
in
the
court
of
appeals,
set
forth
well
in
our
briefs.
the
act
adapted
the
senate
language.
the
reports,
the
floor
debates,
statements
after
the
fact
all
make
very,
very
clear
that
as
far
as
congress
was
concerned,
the
primary
air
quality
standards
were
to
be
met
where
the
plants
were
to
close
or
they
were
to
return
and
get
an
extension
from
congress
itself.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
yes,
yes
i
would.
i
think
the
one
case
that
is
clear
is
that
i
do
not
think
any
court
would
turn
the
lights
out.
i
happened
to
be
in
new
york
when
the
blackout
came
on
for
12
hours.
the
health
damage
by
a
blackout
within
12
hours
will
outweigh
the
advantage
to
help
the
clean
air
act
over
the
years.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
no,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
this
can
be
brought
up
in
enforcement
that
in
this
case
of
a
shutdown
of
electric
plants,
you
would
have
to
balance
again
the
health
factors
involved.
i
think
that
a
decree
to
be
fashioned
by
the
trial
court
that
will
take
into
consideration
what
could
be
done
as
fast
as
it
could
be
done.
you
have
an
adjudicatory
hearing
at
that
time.
the
decree
could
for
instance,
it
could
require
that
low
sulfur
coal
be
used
in
those
plants
in
high
concentration
area.
it
could
require
that
a
particular
plant
might
be
close
down.
it
may
require
that
a
research
program
be
instituted
by
the
utility
to
find
the
kind
of
equipment
that
can
work.
it
can
fashion
under
its
powers
of
equity
which
could
be
reviewed
every
six
months
for
instance,
the
kind
of
decree
that
could
be
as
effective
as
possible.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
that
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
in
a
trial
court
when
an
enforcement
proceeding
is
brought
under
such
in
113
because
at
that
time
that
could
be
heard.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
you
look
under
section
113
that
when
he
enters
an
order
first,
an
order
of
compliance,
it
requires
a
conference.
it
also
requires
that
the
administrator
when
he
issues
his
order
under
section
113,
it
requires
that
he
in
the
order
itself
after
conference
that
he
consider
the
nature
of
the
violation
and
set
forth
a
time
for
compliance
that
is
reasonable,
taking
into
account
the
seriousness
and
the
good
faith
efforts
to
comply.
in
other
words,
before
you
even
get
to
court,
the
epa
administrator
must
satisfy
these
kinds
of
terms
before
he
can
seek
a
decree
from
the
court.
so
that
when
i
think
that
when
you
come
into
the
court,
what
you
ask
for
would
necessarily
be
effected
by
those
kinds
of
considerations
and
it
is
not
a
white
or
black
by
the
time
that
you
ask
the
judge
what
he
requires.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
they
would
be
free
to
raise
any
question
or
issue
that
has
not
been
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
action
of
the
administrator
of
the
epa.
307
(b)
(1)
which
is
what
they
came
in
to
the
court
of
appeals
on,
only
permits
a
review
of
the
action
of
the
administrator.
it
is
not
a
review
of
the
plan
as
a
whole.
this
is
only
of
what
he
acts
as
or
what
he
does
and
we
claim
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
section
110
(a)
(2)
he
cannot
consider
economic
or
technology
factors
and
as
a
result
as
far
as
that
section
is
concerned
or
the
exclusionary
or
preclusion
of
review
is
concerned,
he
would
not
be
affected
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
yes,
your
honor,
110
(a)
(2),
yes.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
may
it
please
the
court,
three
years
has
passed
and
as
result
we
have
run
into
the
absolute
barrier
of
the
three
years.
at
that
point,
the
practicable
language
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
your
honor,
the
question
is
where
that
can
be
heard
and
that
can
be
heard,
we
believe
in
the
state.
it
is
a
state
plan
and
as
i
say,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
there
to
review
the
plan.
they
only
review
the
narrow
grounds
that
epa
acts
on
approving
the
plan.
an
overall
review
of
the
plan
must
be
under
state
law.
it
can
be
reviewed
in
the
state
and
it
can
be
reviewed
as
we
say
if
it
is
a
constitutional
type
ground,
it
can
be
reviewed
on
enforcement.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
may
it
please
the
court.
that
is
what
the
administrator
claims
under
the
act,
applying
the
act.
if
there
is
a
constitutional
ground,
a
substantive
process
ground,
a
balancing
of
health
factors
where
to
close
a
plant
would
be
more
adverse
to
help
in
the
advantages
of
the
clean
air
act.
that
is
a
matter
which
the
court
can
consider
at
that
time.
well,
i
cannot
begin
to
set
forth
what
those
factors
may
be.
i
only
admit
one
which
is
the
closing
of
the
plant.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
right.
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
suggest
that
health
code,
health
inspectors
that
closed
down
plants
for
a
long
time
and
congress
has
the
power
and
has
exercised
the
power
here
under
section
110
(a)
(2),
it
has
exercised
that
power
that
if
necessary
to
meet
the
primary
air
quality
standards
then
they
must
close.
so
that
i
think
that
constitutionally
the
power
is
there.
there
may
be
a
balancing
factor,
i
say
on
health
if
you
are
going
to
try
and
turn
the
lights
out.
if
i
may,
let
me
just
go
back
again
to
110
(a)
(2).
the
way
the
statute
is
structured,
epa
sets
the
primary
air
quality
standard
in
sulfur
dioxide
that
has
been
set.
the
state
had
nine
months
to
come
up
with
the
plan
which
had
to
comply.
section
110
(a)
(2)
states
that
the
administrator
must
approve
a
plan
which
does
comply
with
the
primary
air
quality
standards.
it
is
for
that
reason
to
meet
that
standard
that
congress
was
prepared
to
face
the
closure
problem
and
did.
the
rest
of
the
act
and
the
good
deal
of
the
rest
of
section
110
deals
with
softening
the
effects
of
the
strictness
of
that
standard.
i
will
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
section
110
(a)
(3)
(a)
that
the
plan
can
be
revised
by
the
state
and
this
court
in
train
gave
that
the
broadest
interpretation
it
could
in
the
sense
that
they
can
be
revised
plant
by
plant.
it
can
be
revise
source
by
source
and
company
by
company
as
long
again
as
the
primary
air
standards
are
met.
under
section
110
(e)
when
the
plan
was
submitted
to
the
epa,
the
governor
of
the
state
could
request
a
two-year
extension
to
five
years
if
technology
was
not
available
and
they
did
not
expect
it
within
the
three
years.
under
section
110
(f)
after
the
three
years
or
when
the
three
years
is
up,
the
governor
may
come
in
and
request
a
postponement,
again
because
of
technology
not
being
available.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
especially
to
look
at
section
110
(f).
if
the
petitioner
is
correct,
section
110
(f)
is
a
nullity
because
if
he
says
it
is
infeasible
technologically
or
economically,
the
petitioner
claims
the
plan
as
void.
section
110
(f)
gives
four
grounds
for
postponement
of
one
year
of
the
plan.
the
second
ground
is
technology
is
not
available.
now,
it
seems
to
me
under
section
110
(f)
as
soon
as
he
proves
the
second
ground,
he
is
not
postponing
the
plan,
he
just
voided
it.
the
plan
is
void
at
that
point
and
as
a
result
you
do
not
have
to
go
through
good
faith
compliance
with
national
interest
with
health
or
welfare
requirements
as
set
forth
in
the
rest
of
110
(f).
just
as
soon
as
he
proves
technology
is
unavailable,
he
voided
the
plan.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
the
governor
of
the
state
must
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
it
cannot.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
i
do
not
know
if
they
tried.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
i
am
not
sure
if
many
would.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
(voice
overlap)
most
of
them
would
be
for
a
different
kind
of
plaintiff.
most
of
them
would
be,
for
instance
that
they
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
tremendous
benefit
to
them,
no.
there
may
be
one,
but
i
cannot
think
of
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
but
there
are
many
that
could
come
in
under
that.
namely,
for
instance
had
the
air
quality
standards
have
not
been
met
after
the
fact.
then
you
would
come
in
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
it
is
more
likely
to
be
the
kind
you
get.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
i
would
say
that
the
sixth
and
seventh
as
far
was
directly
before
the
court
namely
that
under
section
307
(b),
a
review
proceeding
of
the
plan
where
the
administratorâ€™s
action
on
the
plan
cannot
bring
up
these
factors.
the
sixth
and
seventh,
i
believe
said
that
they
could
be
brought
up
on
enforcement,
but
they
agree
with
the
eighth
circuit
that
they
could
not
be
brought
up
now.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
the
fourth
and
third,
both
i
think
are
in
direct
conflict,
yes.
as
i
say
110
(f)
would
not
need
to
be
there
if
the
petitioner
were
correct
because
the
plan
would
be
void
as
soon
as
he
proves
that
technology
is
not
there.
may
it
please
the
court,
may
i
also
just
point
out
the
timing.
congress
set
out
nine
months
for
the
state
to
adapt
its
plan
after
hearings.
it
then
set
up
only
four
months
for
the
epa
to
approve.
not
just
one
plan,
but
55
plants.
effectively,
the
epa
had
two
days
per
plan
to
approve
55
state
implementation
plans.
i
think
it
as
the
third
circuit
makes
clear
in
the
duquesne
case
if
congress
had
ever
expected
these
factors
of
technology
and
economy
to
be
considered,
there
is
no
way
within
that
period
of
time
it
could
have
been
done.
again,
this
just
goes,
as
i
say
to
the
structure
of
the
act.
the
act
is
strict,
upfront,
and
then
sets
up
the
means
whereby
it
can
be
soft,
relaxed
and
softened.
but
i
also
point
out
110
(a)
3
(b),
the
energy
act
of
1974
where
again
congress
suggested,
in
fact
required
the
epa
to
review
state
plans
and
when
they
were
more
strict
than
required
could
suggest
to
the
states
that
they
be
softened.
so
long
again
as
they
stay
within
the
primary
air
quality
standards.
so
that,
and
as
i
pointed
out
before
in
section
113
on
enforcement,
they
make
it
very
clear
that
the
enforcement
process
through
the
epa
is
take
into
consideration,
good
faith
attempts
at
compliance
in
a
reasonable
time
schedule.
so
that
i
think
the
structure
of
the
act
is
very
strict
up
front
and
then
softens
issue
attempts
to
soften
as
you
go
through
the
other
parts
of
the
act.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
i
am
informed
that
they
can
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
any
time.
i
have
been
informed
by
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
yes,
in
the
state
courts.
i
might
also
point
out
on
the
hearing
point
on
the
variant
variance.
the
state
now
as
a
matter
of
course
always
grants
a
hearing
on
variances
complied
with.
section
110
(a)
(2)
only
requires
the
fact
that
a
hearing
took
place,
not
that
the
law
requires
it.
so
when
the
agency
in
fact
provides
the
hearing
that
satisfies
the
act.
i
have
here
the
notice
of
hearing
for
the
sui
plant
variance
just
to
show
that
the
in
fact
missouri
is
going
through
that
procedure
there.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
that
is
correct.
i
might
point
out
one
other,
it
is
an
error
i
believe,
in
our
brief
and
the
footnote,
the
variances
that
were
applied
for
in
merit
plans
were
in
fact
denied
by
epa.
they
are
not
pending,
they
were
denied.
they
were
denied
by
the
epa
because
it
simply
was
a
postponement
as
opposed
to
the
modification
setting
for
the
times
for
compliance
and
increased
compliance.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
whether
the
epa
agrees
or
not,
if
it
meets
the
primary
air
quality
standards
under
110
(a)
(2)
it
must
approve.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
the
epa
must.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
if
the
epa
says
that
they
do
not
meet
the
primary
air
quality
standard
under
the
variance,
then
you
have
a
question
that
will
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
review
under
307.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
the
review
itself,
if
the
review
upheld
the
utility
would
be
that
the
revision
would
direct
i
suppose
a
number
of
things
among
other
things,
it
could
direct
the
epa
to
approve
the
change
if
in
fact
the
utility
was
right
that
the
primary
air
quality
standards
were
still
met
under
the
variance.
i
might
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
fact
the
courts
of
appeals
are
not
the
right
place
to
consider
the
kinds
of
things
that
petitioner
wants
to
have
heard.
they
said
if
he
claims
there
is
a
right
to
be
heard
some
place
for
constitutional
grounds,
for
substantive
due
process
grounds
of
some
kind,
then
i
do
not
think
the
court
should
have
it
heard
at
the
one
place
where
congress
said
it
should
not,
which
is
at
the
point
of
approval
the
plan
and
review
there
from.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
i
believe
that
they
can
be
heard
under
the
state
implementation
plan
in
the
state
courts?
mr.
peter
r.
taft
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
may
be
constitutional
grounds
or
maybe
due
process
grounds.
they
are
not
statutory
grounds.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
that
clearly
is
an
enforcement
type
hearing
where
absolutely
you
are
entitled
to
an
adjudicatory
hearing
before
a
court.
that
would
be
in
the
enforcement
stage.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
yes,
i
do
not
know
what
the
grounds
could
be
heard
on.
the
grounds
might
not
be
all
the
grounds
that
he
would
like
to
have
heard.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
and
this
goes
into
the
enforcement
on
where
it
should
be
heard,
assuming
that
there
is
a
thing
there
to
be
heard.
assuming
that
what
you
have
put
forward
is
going
to
the
market
for
500
million
is
a
legitimate
ground
under
some
standard.
assuming
that
i
would
suggest
that
really
what
they
did
was
they
had
an
order
of
violation
from
the
epa.
rather
than
go
through
the
113
procedure
of
a
conference
of
going
through
the
various
grounds
that
the
epa
must
incorporate
into
its
order
of
compliance,
it
chose
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
there
is
a
good
reason
why
they
did.
they
did
that
because
if
they
can
win
the
court
of
appeals,
if
those
things
can
be
heard
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
307,
they
have
avoided
the
plan
and
they
start
the
procedure
all
over
again
back
at
the
state.
if
you
look
at
what
the
third
circuit
did
in
duquesne,
they
have
been
back
and
forth
the
epa
four
times
in
the
original
plan
on
economic
and
technological
grounds.
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
keep
up
with
the
change
in
technology.
our
argument
last
march,
they
were
still
submitting
new
studies
on
technology
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
all
they
were
getting
to
was
avoiding
the
plan
which
would
require
going
back
to
the
state,
back
to
the
epa,
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
finally
only
at
that
time
could
you
get
an
enforcement
started
again.
and
when
you
have
two
years,
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
case
to
be
heard,
you
are
talking
about
the
fact
that
if
they
can
win
by
this
route,
we
cannot
get
back
to
enforcement,
to
a
compliance
schedule
for
perhaps
up
to
three
years.
in
fact,
if
you
go
through
compliance
hearing
in
order
to
enforce
and
a
case
to
enforce
by
the
epa
which
the
state
could
moot
it
anytime
by
revising
the
plan
provided
they
still
come
under
the
primary
air
quality
standards,
they
could
revise
the
plan
along
the
way.
but
assuming
that
you
get
to
an
enforcement
proceeding,
assuming
they
have
an
equitable
ground
that
must
be
heard,
like
going
to
the
market,
like
they
cannot
close
down
all
the
plants,
assuming
they
have
such
a
ground,
the
court
at
that
point
can
fashion
an
order
after
full
adjudicatory
type
hearing,
could
fashion
an
order
which
will
make
the
clean
air
act
as
effective
as
it
can
immediately.
then
you
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
review
at
that
time
and
they
review
the
record
before
the
trial
court
which
must
have
findings
of
fact
in
conclusion
to
go
and
the
decree
is
in
effect
at
that
point
unless
the
court
of
appeals
were
to
stay
it,
if
new
technology
comes
up,
if
a
new
report
comes
up,
you
go
back
under
rule
60
(b)
under
federal
rules
and
you
re-open
at
the
trial
court.
you
do
not
submit
technology
reports
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
oral
argument
as
was
done
in
duquesne.
the
fact
is
the
one
should
get
into
economics
and
to
technology,
inevitably
is
not
a
broad
standard
you
are
concerned
about.
you
get
down
how
it
affects
one
plan.
all
the
plan
does
is
set
an
emission
standard.
how
the
plant
complies
is
up
to
it.
it
may
be,
if
it
has
an
old
plant,
it
cannot
use
a
particular
kind
of
technology.
it
may
be
if
it
is
financial
structure
is
weak
it
cannot
get
to
the
market.
maybe
if
it
is
financial
structure
is
strong
it
could,
but
as
duquesne
indicates,
you
are
getting
to
the
point
where
to
consider
these
you
have
to
consider
it
case
by
case.
and
if
you
are
going
to
consider
it
case
by
case,
enforcement
is
the
only
way
you
can
because
at
that
point
you
call
witnesses,
you
have
your
experts
on
the
stand,
they
are
under
cross-examination
at
that
time
and
that
is
the
way
that
this
kind
of
issue
must
be
heard.
so
that
i
think
that
enforcement
is
the
stage
where
if
they
have
a
ground
then
that
is
where
it
must
be
raised.
it
may
be
equitable.
it
may
be
--
i
just
do
not
know
what
they
will
be,
but
that
will
be
fashioned
as
you
go,
but
to
have
it
heard
on
the
court
of
appeals
is
impossible.
i
think
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
state
of
texas,
the
epa,
which
had
to
do
with
t
the
texas
plan
where
the
epa
changed
the
plan
because
they
did
not
think
the
model
use
on
oxides
would
work.
and
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
point
had
to
go
through
a
diffusion
model
on
oxide
as
it
applies
not
just
to
electric
utilities,
but
to
all
the
various
kinds
of
sources
to
put
oxides
out,
including
automobiles
and
every
kind
of
plant
that
uses
heat
of
any
kind.
and
if
you
see
there,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
cork
in
concurring
said
that
this
is
no
way
to
review
this
kind
of
matter
as
to
technical.
they
did
not
have
findings
of
fact
to
conclusions
of
law.
in
fact,
after
it
was
argued,
they
had
hold
hearings
informally
with
the
parties
from
both
sides
and
in
fact
with
experts
so
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
the
expert
could
take
them
through
the
diffusion
model
used
by
the
state
and
the
one
use
by
the
epa
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
that
and
that
is
just
the
overall
model
used,
that
did
not
even
get
into
the
question
whether
or
not
it
was
feasible
as
to
particular
plants
and
sources.
as
far
as
the
so2
standard
is
concerned,
60%
of
your
so2
according
to
the
epa
comes
out
and
as
reported
in
duquesne,
comes
out
from
electric
power
plants.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
not
sure
what
--
i
am
not
conceding
what
the
standards
would
be
or
what
could
be
raised.
the
only
one
that
will
concede
is
that
they
cannot
turn
out
the
lights
and
that
is
a
health
balance
that
would
be
drawn
by
the
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
the
question
is
what
the
grounds
could
be
that
they
would
raise
and
i
think
you
have
to
go
case
by
case
when
that
happens.
well,
in
a
similar
case
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
strictly
that
the
plan
is
void
if
feasibility
is
not
economically
or
technologically
achievable
because
the
power
to
close
was
there
and
congress
saw
it.
the
question
would
be
a
different
kind
of
choice.
the
question
would
be
that
if
it
is
impossible
for
this
plant
at
that
point
i
do
not
think
your
grounds
will
be
that
it
is
impossible.
your
ground
would
be
that
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
well,
at
that
point
the
health
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
if
it
were
electricity
and
turning
out
the
lights,
if
it
were
a
marginal
and
weak
plant
that
is
not
involved
with
utilities
which
is
producing
say
some
product
and
produces
so2,
it
is
a
marginal
plan,
it
is
a
weak
company,
it
cannot
comply.
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
it
would
close.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
(a)
yes,
i
think
it
can
be
raised.
the
scope
of
it
would
be
decided
by
the
courtâ€™s
at
that
time.
as
far
as
criminal
is
concerned,
i
would
suggest
that
if
it
is
an
electric
plant
if
you
could
not
close
it
you
cannot
put
them
in
jail
for
not
closing
it
and
so
that
i
think
that
that
would
just
have
to
wait
and
see
how
it
comes
up
in
fact.
i
do
not
believe
that
they
will
bring
that
particular
case
if
they
do
[laughter]
i
will
be
surprised.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
statute
does
shift
the
risk.
it
puts
the
risk
on
them
and
the
risk
was
intentional
by
congress
to
force
them
to
do
the
best
they
can.
if
perhaps
under
the
fear
they
may
not
prevail
on
enforcement
and
that
is
the
technology
forcing
act
and
that
is
a
very
powerful
persuading
--
to
persuade
them
to
in
fact
develop
the
technology
if
they
can.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
r.
taft
the
state
is
heavily
involved.
i
would
suggest
that
under
the
utility
laws
that
they
have
to
give
them
a
rate
of
return
against
proper
expenditures
in
the
clean
air
act
to
be
a
proper
expenditure.
the
circuit
got
into
that
and
wanted
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
the
puc
would
apply
the
law
and
that
i
think
--
mr.
peter
r.
taft
if
you
helping
me
out.
i
think
you
are
actually
right.
