justice
thurgood
marshall
the
union
electric
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petition
is
the
operator
of
an
emission
source
regulated
by
state
implementation
plan
under
the
clean
air
act.
and
a
petition
for
review
of
the
state
plan
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
petitioner
claimed
that
it
was
economically
and
technologically
impossible
for
him
to
comply
with
the
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
petitioner
could
not
raise
such
a
claim
and
we
affirm.
the
1970
amendments
to
the
clean
air
act
were
a
drastic
remedy,
to
what
was
perceived
as
a
serious
and
otherwise
uncheckable
problem
of
air
pollution.
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendments
conclusively
demonstrates,
congress
made
the
considered
judgment
that
a
certain
level
of
clean
air
was
necessary
for
the
health
and
well
being
of
the
people
and
it
determined
to
force
technology
to
achieve
that
result.
thus
the
amendments
require
regulated
emission
sources
to
meet
certain
air
quality
standards
with
those
specific
period
of
time
whether
compliance
of
those
standards
seemed
possible
or
not.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
find
that
this
game,
there
is
no
room
for
petitioner
to
claim
the
compliances
technologically
or
economically
impossible.
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
powell
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
mr.
chief
justice
joined.
