mr.
william
h.
ferrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
it
arose
by
a
petition
brought
under
the
judicial
review
section
of
the
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1970,
to
review
the
sulfur
emission
regulation
in
the
missouri
implementation
plan.
section
307
(b)
(1)
says
that
petitions
may
be
brought
within
two
different
time
periods.
in
the
first
place,
the
petition
may
be
brought
within
30
days
after
the
administrator
of
the
epa
approves
the
implementation
plan.
in
that
event,
it
is
probable
that
there
would
be
an
administrative
record
which
is
susceptible
of
review
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
section
secondly
says
that
petitions
may
be
brought
at
a
later
date
if
tmr.
justice
rehnquisthey
arise
solely
on
grounds
that
have
occurred
more
than
30
days
after
the
epa
approved
the
state
devised
implementation
plan.
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain,
this
is
the
only
case
in
the
united
states
that
has
been
brought
more
than
30
days
after
the
epa
approved
the
implementation
plan,
and
of
course,
brought
on
grounds
that
arose
more
than
30
days
after
such
group.
there
were
a
substantial
number
of
cases
that
have
been
filed
within
this
initial
30-day
period
which
in
99%
of
the
cases
occurred
within
the
month
of
june
1972
and
those
cases
have
resulted
in
a
apparently
substantial
number
of
opinions
by
the
several
united
states
courts
of
appeals
and
the
various
circuits
because
this
implementation
plan
review
petitions
must
be
brought
in
the
appropriate
circuit,
first
to
tenth.
the
results
have
differed
in
those
decisions
and
i
think
that
it
is
the
differing
results
that
have
occurred
vis-à-vis
themselves
and
the
different
result
in
many
of
those
cases
with
the
result
reached
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
instant
case
is
now
before
your
honors,
there
is
the
reason
this
case
is
here,
that
is
the
basis
for
us
to
grant
of
certiorari.
now,
let
us
take
a
quick
look
at
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner’s
petition.
union
electric
alleges
that
three
of
its
base
load
electric
generating
plants
and
base
load
plants
are
the
one
that
supply
the
bulk
of
the
electricity,
three
of
them,
all
located
in
the
state
of
missouri
in
the
eighth
circuit
do
not
meet
the
sulfur
emission
regulation
in
the
state
devised
implementation
plan,
that
by
epa
approval
has
become
a
federal
law.
we
allege
that
grounds
which
of
a
reason
more
than
30
days
after
the
epa
approval
make
it
impossible
for
union
electric
on
technical
grounds
to
comply
with
this
regulation
and
we
allege
that
it
would
be
manifestly
against
the
public
interest
for
union
electric
to
make
an
attempt
to
comply.
now,
going
on
a
scientific
possibility
of
compliance,
i
am
not
saying
that
it
may
work
out,
there
are
as
far
as
we
know
and
as
far
as
we
allege
in
the
petition
only
two
scientific
basis
of
which
a
compliance
could
hope
to
be
attempted.
one
is
by
the
utilization
of
what
is
called
sulfur
dioxide
removal
equipment,
in
the
industry
is
commonly
known
as
scrubbers
and
perhaps
that
is
what
we
actually
refer
to
it
from
time
to
time.
the
other
method
would
be
the
use
of
a
low
sulfur
content
coal.
it
is
ordinarily
found
in
the
midwest
and
it
is
not
too
frequent
these
days.
we
allege
in
our
petition
that
in
the
time
following
the
period
30
days
after
the
administrator
approved
the
epa
plan,
i
mean,
the
administrator
of
the
epa
approve
the
implementation
plan,
thereby
making
it
federal
law
that
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
no
scrubbers
have
been
developed
or
invented
that
would
permit
or
enable
a
compliance
with
this
sulfur
emission
regulation.
so
we
demonstrate
that
it
is
technically
impossible
to
comply
with
this
federal
law
and
we
allege
that
those
grounds
have
a
reason
more
than
30
days
following
the
epa
approval.
now,
it
is
true
that
a
considerable
number
of
years
ago,
utilities
and
suppliers
began
to
work
on
what
are
called
scrubbers,
development,
invent
them,
union
electric
was
deeply
engaged
in
this
project.
there
were
high
hopes,
high
expectations,
but
unhappily
in
light
and
in
this
case,
the
expectations
have
not
been
realized
and
this
(inaudible)
in
our
complaint,
one
that
we
think
that
is
susceptible
of
proof
and
i
think
should
be
taken
by
this
court
in
these
deliberations
as
being
a
fact.
now,
going
to
low
sulfur
coal
i
think
even
and
i
am
not
saying
this
in
any
derogatory
manner,
but
my
brethren
of
the
department
of
justice,
the
respondent
epa
would
agree
that
there
is
unhappily
is
just
not
enough
low
sulfur
coal
at
this
time.
and
if
we
go
on
to
the
market
and
corner
it,
beat
it
up,
up,
up,
we
are
going
to
run
into
electric
rates.
money
has
to
come
from
somewhere
and
it
comes
from
the
consumers.
so
we
are
going
to
have
electric
rate
so
high,
that
we
corner
the
market
on
low
sulfur
coal
that
it
would
topple,
virtually
destroy
the
economy
on
the
st.
louis
area,
much
of
missouri,
illinois,
and
iowa.
so
we
contend
that
it
would
be
manifestly
against
the
public
interest
for
us
to
attempt
if
we
could
to
corner
the
market.
now,
turning
a
minute
to
scrubbers
if
i
may,
i
am
sure
all
of
your
honors
are
familiar
with
the
fact,
there
has
been
a
series
of
inflation
in
the
world
today,
unhappily
the
price
of
these
ineffective
scrubbers,
these
inefficient
scrubbers
that
will
not
enable
us
to
comply
have
increased
so
enormously
that
to
install
them
on
our
three
electric
generating
plants
would
cost
us
over
$500
million.
assuming
that
we
can
go
on
to
the
market
in
new
york
and
ask
and
get
$500
million
for
non-productive
equipment,
we
have
terrible
carrying
charges
as
we
allege,
it
is
worth
hundred
million
dollars
per
year,
that
would
call
for
terrible
increase
on
electric
rates.
we
do
not
allege
the
percentage,
but
it
would
be
so
high
that
we
say
it
would
be
manifestly
against
the
public
interest
and
again
it
would
be
imposing
upon
our
economy
and
economic
condition
there
would
be
manifestly
against
the
public
interest.
i
think
there
is
one
variant
part
of
allegation
in
our
complaint
that
has
to
be
realized
and
considered
in
this
entire
case
and
that
is
our
allegation
that
although
union
electric,
the
petitioner
is
not
meeting
the
state
sulfur
emission
standard
in
the
federally
approved
implementation
plan,
it
is
fulfilling
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards,
both
primarily
and
secondary
and
these
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
are
really
thrust
the
purpose
of
our
clean
air
act.
i
suppose
that
when
you
get
down
to
precise
question
as
you
have
to
at
some
time
or
should
in
any
lawsuit,
perhaps
make
an
existence
precisely
as
possible
to
do,
what
do
we
mean
by
the
word
“grounds”
in
the
judicial
review
section?
well
it
is
a
word
of
general
import;
lawyers
use
it
all
the
time.
judges
use
it.
i
do
not
know
if
whether
we
always
know
exactly
what
we
mean
by
it,
but
here
i
do
not
think
we
can
take
that
word
alone.
we
have
to
look
at
to
congressional
history.
we
have
a
somewhat
ambiguous
statute
here.
we
have
to
look
at
the
congressional
history
and
there
is
one
other
thing
that
i
want
to
point
out
and
that
is
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
rule
that
you
should
construe
an
act
of
congress
to
be
constitutional
or
rather
than
unconstitutional
for
the
reason
of
the
concept.
so
sometimes
in
the
constructional
process
itself,
we
are
confronted
with
constitutional
questions.
now,
let
me
divert,
if
i
may
for
just
one
second,
there
has
been
a
kind
of
a
thread
that
is
running
through
this
litigation
and
that
is
that
where
really
you
should
not
and
maybe
you
do
not
intend
to
place
a
fact-finding
original
type
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
appeals,
for
we
claim
that
you
have
here,
but
the
statute
has,
the
congressional
act
has,
maybe
that
is
unfortunate,
i
suppose
it
is
unfortunate
the
courts
have
more
than
they
can
do
anyway,
but
it
has
been
done
here
and
the
question
is,
what
are
the
facts
to
be
found?
we
say
that
these
technical
and
economic
factors
making
it
impossible
for
petitioners
to
comply
with
the
regulation,
although
we
are
fulfilling
the
federal
standard.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
well,
i
do
in
my
brief
and
i
will
now
point
out
that
we
think
from
constitutional
point
of
view,
there
are
three
different
methods
that
the
constitutional
requirement
should
be
met
and
when
you
talk
about
a
different
type
of
review
in
a
sense
you
have
to
look
at
the
two
periods
of
time.
i
hope
i
am
not
taking
too
long
to
answer
your
question,
but
when
you
have
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
30
days
after
the
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
has
approved
the
plan
then
you
do
have
some
kind
of
a
record
before
the
court.
but
when
you
are
alleging
in
your
petition
in
the
court
of
appeals
grounds
that
arose
long
after
the
federal
agency
has
acted,
you
do
not
have
an
administrator
or
administrative
record
or
review
with
one
possible
exception
which
i
refer
to
in
my
brief
and
i
think
it
is
a
possible
one,
one
that
might
be
adapted
by
this
court.
maybe
it
is
the
best
one,
i
do
not
know,
we
are
unhappily
dealing
with
a
sort
of
ambiguous
act
of
congress
and
presented
with
a
very
difficult
problem,
well,
you
do
not
want
to
throw
it
out
completely
as
being
too
ambiguous.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
they
did
say
that.
they
did
say
that
and
i
have
been
anticipating
whether
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
the
time
period
really
makes
a
difference.
procedurally,
i
think
it
probably
might.
in
my
initial
brief,
i
skirted
around
it,
in
my
reply
brief
and
the
adversary
have
sometimes,
i
have
got
a
little
more
definitely
to
it,
but
i
am
not
at
all
assured.
i
mean,
i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
that
technical
and
economic
factors
must
be
considered
at
any
time.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
yes,
i
mean,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
say
what
is
exactly
part
of
the
opinion,
what
is
the
dicta,
but
he
did
say
that
this
is
a
political
matter
that
these
technical
factors
and
economic
factors
are
matters
of
politics,
matters
which
the
judiciary
cannot
touch
matters
beyond
the
judiciary.
that
to
me
brings
in
sort
of
a
constitutional
feeling
i
have,
but
here
we
have
something
that
the
person
can
lose
his
business
for
it.
it
is
a
federal
law.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
well,
there
is
the
other.
i
do
say
that
in
enforcement
proceeding
that
is
possible.
i
question
whether
that
is
a
very
clear
interpretation
from
the
statute
that
it
should
be
raised
in
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
no,
in
fact
i
say
that
if
you
rule
as
has
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
indiana
in
michigan
electric
company
case,
former
justice
of
this
court
was
ahead
of
the
time
there.
mr.
justice
clark,
i
think
it
s
a
buckeye
case.
i
think
that
is
a
sixth
circuit
that
held
that
the
constitutional
difficulty
is
same
and
i
would
agree
with
him
if
the
point
may
be
raised
in
enforcement
proceeding.
now,
of
course,
the
statute
itself
says
that
you
may
not
raise
anything
in
an
enforcement
proceeding,
there
is
a
preclusionary
provision,
if
it
may
be
raised
in
a
judicial
review
proceeding.
maybe
--
may
i
mention
just
one
practical
matter?
maybe
it
is
not
a
legal
matter,
but
the
utility
industry
is
engaged
in
a
very
large
capital
raising
campaign
and
it
maybe
true
that
it
will
come
about,
but
you
hate
to
go
to
the
wall
street
when
you
right
sitting
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
that
may
close
down
all
of
your
plants
or
require
to
pay
as
much
as
a
$50,000.00
a
day
in
fine
per
plant
to
keep
them
open
which
would
mean
you
could
not
get
the
working
capital
to
go
on
and
you
kind
of
hate
to
go
on
and
try
to
raise
money
to
build
new
plants
and
we
must
build
new
plants.
in
fact,
new
plants
must
be
built
just
to
stay
on
even
line.
everybody
has
--
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
well,
the
variance
procedure
this
court
did,
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
the
author
of
the
opinion,
decided
one
and
only
one
case
under
the
clean
air
act
and
that
is
a
variance
approved
by
the
state
under
the
state
law
may
thereafter
be
consider
a
revision
of
an
implementation
plan
and
approved
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
under
to
be
precise
i
think
it
is
101
or
110
(c)
of
the
clean
air
act,
if
there
will
not
be
any
jeopardy
to
the
maintenance
of
the
national
air
quality
standards.
but
at
least
in
missouri
and
i
will
not
go
down
missouri,
there
is
one
difficulty
about
that.
the
statute
that
governs
the
epa’s
approval
of
a
variance,
a
revision
section
101
(c)
says
there
must
be
a
public
hearing
and
the
missouri
statute
that
provides
for
variances
and
i
think
others
too
as
well
as
missouri,
say
that
a
variance
may
be
granted
without
a
hearing
and
at
least
90%
of
them
are.
the
executive
secretary,
i
do
not
like
to
say
percentages,
i
do
not
really
know
or
many
of
them
are,
the
executive
secretary
proves
the
grant
of
the
variance
to
the
air
act
conservation
permission
as
granted
without
a
hearing.
so,
at
least
in
missouri
we
cannot
have
epa
approved
variances
unless
there
is
a
hearing.
now,
if
there
is
a
hearing,
the
epa
still
proceeds
with
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
law,
you
see
we
have
separate
verification,
we
have
a
state
law,
we
have
a
federal
law,
i
mean,
that
does
not
really
have
any
particular
concern
on
what
state
is
doing,
the
state
can
have
a
proceeding
that
goes
on
for
four
or
five
six
years
--
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
well,
we
say
that
that
is
not
correct.
we
are
trying
to
get
variances,
but
they
are
not
–-
we
would
hope
that
--
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
we
always
have
application,
whenever
we
have
a
variance
we
have
an
application
for
it.
we
do
that
yes.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
but
right
now
they
are
all
applications.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
i
think
the
reason
is
just
waiting
on
this
decision
and
i
think
everybody
quit.
but
we
would
anticipate,
we
have
a
recommendation
by
the
way
for
the
granting
of
a
variance
by
the
executive
secretary.
now,
if
those
recommendations
are
approved,
we
will
have
a
variance
given
they
have
not
been
approved
by
the
air
conservation
of
missouri,
but
if
the
air
conservation
does
approve,
we
will
have
a
variance
grant
without
a
hearing
and
then
that
cannot
be
approved
by
the
epa.
it
cannot
be
an
epa
approved
variance.
so
we
do
not
have
any
variances
as
far
as
federal
law
is
concerned
and
then
there
may
be
--
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
well,
it
would
be
on
collusive.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
it
will
only
be
collusive.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
well,
there
are
two
methods
of
getting
a
hearing.
one
is,
if
the
executive
secretary
does
not
recommend
against
the
variance
then
there
is
a
hearing
if
the
attorney
requests
and
the
second
is
if
there
is
intervenor
or
some
party
that,
normally
the
environmental
agency
would
be
that
intervenes
the
proceedings
as
they
do
not
want
a
variance
granted
then
there
is
a
hearing
and
then
we
would
have
a
procedure.
during
that
procedure
the
federal
law
would
be
enforced,
we
would
be
fined
$50,000.00
a
day,
$25,000.00
a
day,
we
would
be
subject
to
a
fine
for
all
this
time
and
there
is
no
break
vindication
after
four
or
five
years
to
have
an
epa
approved
variance
if
during
that
four
or
five
years
is
spent,
wither
you
have
shut
down
your
plants.
if
you
were
an
individual,
you
were
jailed
or
you
had
to
pay
an
enormous
amount
in
fines
and
of
course
your
honors,
no,
we
are
not
going
to
shut
down
any
plants
under
any
circumstances
until
the
army
tells
us
to
do
so
or
this
court.
i
notice
that
my
white
light
is
on.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
may
retain
just
a
few
minutes.
mr.
william
h.
ferrell
if
i
may
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
take
only
one
or
two
minutes
to
not
to
respond
point
by
point
and
then
extend
the
argument
that
have
been
made.
i
would
refer
to
our
briefs
on
that,
but
i
want
to
make
one
unique
point
that
arises
for
the
first
time
i
think
in
american
juridical
history.
and
that
is
that
we
have
here
the
very
anomalous
situation
where
a
state
can
place
an
emission
and
an
emission
limitation
in
a
plant
that
exceeds
the
national
air
quality
standards
and
that
by
epa
approval
of
that
plan,
it
becomes
federal
law
whereas
the
federal
government
itself,
if
it
made
an
implementation
plan
could
not
place
an
emission
limitation
that
exceeds
the
national
air
quality
standards.
that
is
due,
i
think
to
a
clear
misreading
of
section
116,
both
as
to
congressional
history
and
as
to
the
section
itself.
so
we
pray
for
a
reversal
into
accordance
with
our
prayer
and
petition.
thank
you.
