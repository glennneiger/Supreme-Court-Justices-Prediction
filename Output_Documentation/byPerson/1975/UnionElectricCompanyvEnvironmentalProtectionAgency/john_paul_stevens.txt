justice
john
paul

mr.
ferrell
as
i
listen
to
you
i
was
just
thinking
about
the
interest
of
the
state
of
missouri.
i
suppose
that
people
in
missouri
would
be
unhappy
if
you
had
to
close
up
the
utility
and
not
serve
the
community
anymore.
is
it
that
your
reaction
they
are
not
proceeding
in
that
area,
that
arena
because
they
ruled
against
you
on
the
merits
whereas
there
is
no
procedure
in
missouri
at
all
in
which
you
can
raise
any
of
these
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
missouri
practice
are
you
permitted
to
ask
for
a
hearing
if
you
need
that
in
order
to
validate
your
defenses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it
satisfy
the
federal
requirement
if
that
is
the
only
problem
–-
justice
john
paul
stevens
excuse
me,
i
do
not
have
the
statute,
that
is
part
of
the
statute
in
front
of
me
just
to
follow
you.
in
what
kind
of
a
proceeding
does
he
raise
the
110
(f)
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
that
the
state
is
against
the
utility
as
it
is
here
and
the
state
is
satisfied,
what
can
the
utility
do
to
raise
a
110
(f)
issues?
can
it
do
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
that
really
is
not
relevant
to
union
electric’s
argument
here
then,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
it
just
a
little
differently.
let
us
just
for
a
moment,
307
(b)
(1)
which
is
where
they
seek
to
come
in
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
they
may
not
raise
technological
factors
as
i
understand
your
position.
is
there
anything
they
can
raise
in
the
307
(b)
(1)
proceeding
if
you
assume
that
the
state
has
complied
with
the
minimum
requirements
in
the
8
sub
paragraphs
of
one
amici.
what
grounds
would
be
reviewable
at
the
petition
of
the
utility
in
the
307
(b)
(1)
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
think
there
will
be
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
review
of
the
request
of
a
utility,
this
provision
really
is
a
nullity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
could
not
think
of
any
one.
i
was
trying
to
think
of
what
it
might?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
an
environmental
proof
might
come
in
and
say
the
standards
are
not
strict
enough
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taft,
may
i
ask
another
procedural
question.
apart,
from
the
variance
procedure
in
missouri,
is
there
a
state
procedure
by
which
the
utility
may
challenge
the
basic
plan
that
missouri
submits
for
approval
by
the
epa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
state
court.
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taft,
let
me
just
get
one
thing
off
my
mind.
you
have
been
assuming
i
think
that
the
issue
can
be
raised
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
and
that
such
a
proceeding
would
be
an
equitable
proceeding.
is
it
not
possible
if
the
enforcement
proceeding
would
be
a
criminal
proceeding
and
would
the
issue
be
raisable
in
such
a
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
--
you
are
saying
it
is
possible
that
their
argument
might
be
successful
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.
you
do
not
concede
as
you
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
the
seventh
circuit
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
or
does
he
have
a
position
on
whether
these
issues
maybe
raised
in
an
enforcement
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
danger
of
close,
i
mean,
it
is
always
possible
to
close?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
the
question
would
be
if
the
defendant
could
show
that
it
was
impossible
to
comply
without
closing
would
that
be
a
defense
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
or
an
issue
that
could
be
properly
be
raised
in
enforcement
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
question,
if
that
is
an
issue
that
the
defendant
in
the
judgment
of
the
solicitor
general,
is
that
an
issue
which
can
appropriately
be
raised
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
(a)
civil
(b)
criminal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
chance
any
way
the
utility
will
say,
well,
i
must
obey
the
law,
namely
the
clean
air
act
and
therefore
i
shall
shutdown
and
tell
nobody.
they
have
to
go?
