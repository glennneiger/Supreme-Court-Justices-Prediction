justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
taft,
when
would
an
equitable
decree
of
this
kind
be
handed
down
by
court?
i
understand
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
to
be
in
accord
with
that
of
eighth
circuit
that
the
courts
no
longer
have
a
new
power
to
review
the
plan
to
consider
whether
it
is
economically
or
technologically
feasible.
when
would
this
decree
you
describe
come
down
and
why
and
under
what
circumstances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
the
parties
have
reached
an
impasse?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
utility
would
say
we
got
to
put
the
lights
out.
the
administrator
would
then
bring
a
suit
to
turn
the
lights
on.
all
you
need
is
$500
million.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
suggesting
that
the
decree
of
the
eighth
circuit,
the
judgment
of
the
eight
circuit
be
affirmed
and
that
the
parties
then
proceed
to
the
point
where
they
have
a
type
of
hearing
you
are
now
describing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
it
would
be
any
res
judicata
the
effect
of
the
eighth
circuit
decision,
would
the
company
be
free
to
raise
every
issue
that
it
raised
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
the
section
that
provides
in
substance
that
the
plan
must
be
implemented
as
promptly
as
practicable
and
in
any
event
within
three
years?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
the
requirement
that
the
plan
be
put
into
effect
as
promptly
as
practicable
is
affected
by
the
feasibility
of
the
plan
as
it
affects
a
given
utility
for
example?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
however
impractical
the
plan
may
be
after
the
three
years?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
taft,
before
you
go
on,
do
you
consider
the
decisions
in
this
area
in
i
think
the
fourth,
sixth,
and
seventh
circuits
are
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
the
fourth?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do
not
question,
i
take
it,
the
right
to
be
heard
somewhere,
do
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
again,
are
you
suggesting
no
right
to
a
due
process
hearing
before
a
utility
plan
is
closed
down?
no
right
to
have
such
a
hearing
anywhere?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
are
entitled
to
a
due
process
hearing
before
the
automobile
can
be
repossessed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
agree
that
the
utility
is
entitled
to
a
due
process
hearing
somewhere?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
ground
would
be
either
that
the
plant
would
shutdown.
while
i
have
interrupted
you,
let
me
say
this.
this
is
not
really
an
adversary
case
in
the
normal
sense.
the
government
perhaps
has
a
greater
interest
than
the
petitioner
here
in
seeing
that
the
public
is
served
and
served
at
reasonable
rates
and
served
without
polluting
the
atmosphere.
the
briefs
indicate
that
half
a
billion
dollars
would
have
to
be
raised
to
meet
the
standards
and
keep
the
plant
going.
they
ought
to
be,
there
must
be
some
way
to
bring
this
issue
before
a
fact
finding
tribunal
with
authority
to
decide
the
issue
of
properly
or
improperly.
now,
these
people
went
to
court,
you
say
they
went
to
the
wrong
court.
i
would
like
you
to
review
again
so
that
it
would
be
clear
to
me
what
the
next
step
ought
to
be.
you
represent
the
government
of
the
united
states,
what
should
this
utility
do?
it
cannot
go
to
the
market
and
raise
a
half
a
billion
dollars,
that
is
perfectly
absurd
in
the
present
climate
of
affairs.
what
should
be
done?
