mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
is
a
narrow
one,
whether
the
instruction
that
the
district
judge
gave
without
more
requires
reversal.
petitioner’s
position
is
that
this
is
error
and
it
is
error
that
cannot
be
harmless.
i
think
the
place
to
start
is
on
page
18
of
the
appendix,
just
to
look
exactly
how
this
issue
arose?
on
the
bottom
of
page
18,
defense
counsel
told
the
court,
i
feel
that
i
do
not
have
the
right
to
confer
with
him
my
client
--
i
do
have
the
right
to
confer
with
him,
but
not
to
coach
him
as
to
what
he
may
say
on
cross
examination,
or
to
how
to
answer
questions.
thereafter
a
little
further
down,
the
court
says,
i
think
you
might
ask
him
right
now,
right
here
while
we
are
here,
what
does
he
think,
he
thinks
you
ought
to
call
in
the
morning.
let
us
put
it
this
way,
you
ask
him
right
now,
if
he
thinks
that
there
are
any
witnesses,
you
ought
to
call
during
the
evening,
if
anything
comes
up
after
he
has
been
crossed
examined
and
after
you
have
had
an
opportunity
for
redirect,
we
would
have
a
recess
and
you
are
going
to
have
as
much
time
as
you
want
to
talk
over
trial
strategy.
so
this
case
really
arises
under
circumstances
where
counsel
who
is
best
familiar
with
the
defendant
and
said
to
the
court,
i
really
do
not
want
to
talk
to
him
about
his
testimony
at
all.
all
i
want
to
talk
to
him
about
there
other
matter
and
the
court
says,
okay,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
other
matters,
that
is
fine.
you
can
talk
to
him
about
other
matters
now,
and
if
you
need
extra
time
at
the
conclusion
of
the
direct
examination,
or
after
the
cross
examination,
i
will
give
you
additional
time.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
judge
was
getting
ready
to
do
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
judge
originally
said
on
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
on
the
bottom
page
16,
however,
your
honor,
the
judge
says,
does
the
government
wish
to
proceed
with
his
cross
examination
now.
there
are
reasons
why
you
may,
or
may
not
accept
for
the
time
factor,
i
do
not
know.
and
one
reason
which
why
i
think
the
prosecution
did
not
want
to
proceed,
it
was
already
4:55
and
the
normal
time
for
adjournment
was
5:30.
if
he
had
proceeded
the
result
would
have
been
a
recess
during
the
cross
examination.
during
the
next
day,
when
the
cross
examination
commence,
it
took
the
entire
morning,
it
took
the
entire
afternoon.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
it
could
have
been
solved
that
way,
right
(voice
overlap).
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yeah,
well,
let
me
--
let
me
just
put
this
case
in
little,
add
some
extra
facts
to
put
this
in
perspective,
this
whole
incident.
this
trial
covered
a
two
weeks
span.
the
government
completed
this
case
and
the
case,
what
case
was,
the
defendant
was
charged
and
convicted
of
conspiring
to
import
1,000
pounds
of
marijuana
in
the
united
states
and
his
defense
was
entrapment.
now,
the
government
completed
this
case
during
the
first
week
of
trial.
in
fact,
it
completed
this
case
on
thursday
and
except
for
two
witnesses
who
testified
the
following
week
that
the
substance
imported
was
marijuana.
at
this
point
on
thursday,
the
court
recessed
and
so
both
the
government
and
defense
counsel
had
thursday
night,
friday,
saturday,
and
sunday
to
discuss
the
cases
with
their
witnesses.
now,
during
the
course
of
the
presentation
of
the
case,
the
court
had
instructed
all
of
the
government
witnesses,
in
the
same
fashion
as
it
instructed
the
defense
--
the
defendant
here,
not
to
talk
to
lawyers
during
a
recess.
indeed
when
the
case
commenced
on
the
second
week
when
there
was
a
motion
on
behalf
of
petitioners
attorney
that
the
government’s
case
agent
who
i
have
been
called
as
the
defense
witness,
should
not
be
allowed
to
participate
in
a
prosecutorial
conference
and
the
court
said,
okay,
if
you
do
not
want
to
participate,
i
will
instruct
to
him
not
to
participate.
so
this
was
--
the
way
this
case
was
handled,
both
sides
were
treated
equally,
both
sides
were
not
allowed
to
discuss
their
testimony
with
their
witnesses
while
the
witnesses
were
on
the
stand.
now,
the
judge
even
though,
he
put
this
--
put
counsel
in
the
bind
so
to
speak
as
to
talking
to
the
witnesses
overnight,
however,
he
was
very
free
and
liberal
in
granting
recesses.
for
example,
during
the
afternoon,
before
defendant
commenced
test
--
commenced
his
testimony,
he
granted
two
recesses
for
defense
counsel.
one
to
talk
to
a
witness
and
two,
he
granted
a
recess,
a
recess
which
i
think
is
essential,
the
defense
counsel
said,
i
would
like
to
talk
to
my
client
now,
that
the
government’s
case
is
almost
closed,
so
we
can
make
a
decision
as
to
whether,
he
is
going
to
take
the
stand
and
testify.
so
the
judge
said
fine,
we
will
grant
you
another
recess
to
make
that
decision.
now,
subsequently
after
the
defense
finished
--
after
the
government
finished
its
re-direct
examination
of
the
defendant
there
was
another
recess.
there
was
another
recess
and
that
is
on
page
22
of
the
appendix
which
we
think
is
significant
to
show
that
we
do
not
have
an
arbitrary
judge
here.
between,
when
the
government
completed
its
cross
examination
it
was
time
for
a
luncheon
break.
at
that
point,
the
court
said
to
defense
counsel,
i
am
going
to
instruct
your
client
not
to
talk
to
you,
during
the
luncheon
break.
at
this
point,
counsel
said,
your
honor,
i
know
of
notice
on
page
22,
i
know
of
no
way
that
i
can
properly
examine
my
client
on
redirect
examination,
unless
i
talk
to
him
about
the
cross
examination
and
about
other
factors
pertaining
to
the
case.
so
the
court
said,
alright
you
can
go
ahead
and
talk
to
him.
so
what
you
really
have
here,
is
a
situation
just
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
like
leighton
versus
united
states,
the
second
circuit
case,
in
which
i
think
you
could
say
that
all
counsel
was
doing
here
was
trying
sow
error
into
the
record.
if
he
had
pressed,
if
counsel
had
pressed
at
the
time
--
at
the
conclusion
between
direct
and
cross
and
said,
i
want
to
talk
to
my
client,
i
want
to
talk
to
him
about
potential
questions
on
cross
examination,
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
done
the
same
thing,
as
he
did
between
the
cross
and
redirect.
now,
concededly
assistance
of
counsel
requires
consultation
and
preparation.
counsel
normally
prepares
a
case
before
trial
and
it
is
often
necessary
not
only
you
cannot
complete
the
preparation
of
your
case
before
trial
because
many
things
happen
unexpected,
so
you
do
have
to
prepare
for
--
prepare
your
case
while
the
case
is
proceeding
and
this
requires
you
to
make
use
of
recess.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
when
counsel
is
here
says
i
do
not
want
a
recess,
i
do
not
want
to
recess
to
talk
to
my
client
about
his
testimony,
i
think
the
court
is
entitled
to
take
him
at
phase
value.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
is
our
position
if
he
had
asked,
if
he
had
said
that,
we
would
take
the
position
he
should
have
the
right
to
talk
to
the
client
about
his
testimony.
the
reason
we
do
is
illustrated
by
this
case.
what
would
occur
if
there
was
a
denial,
would
be
a
claim
that
there
was
a
denial
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
government
to
rebut,
whether
or
not,
the
counsel
had
something
that
occurred
which
require
a
recess
at
that
time.
after
all,
there
is
the
lawyer-client
privilege
relationship
and
there
would
be
no
way
to
rebut
something
like
that.
that
is
why
we
do
not
say
this
is
a
practice
that
should
ordinarily
follow,
because
it
does
create
these
types
of
problems,
but
when
you
have
a
situation
where
counsel
says
like
here,
i
do
not
want
to
talk
to
my
client
about
his
testimony,
that
is
a
unique
situation,
and
we
think
there
is
no
violation
of
his
assistance
to
counsel
in
that
situation
and
there
is
no
harm.
now
of
course,
when
a
defendant
testifies,
he
subjects
himself
to
restrictions,
just
like
any
other
witness.
under
our
advisory
system,
he
is
not
entitled
to
recess
just
because
an
embarrassing
question
is
asked.
the
jury
is
entitled
to
hear
his
testimony
and
decide
on
the
basis
of
his
personal
responses,
is
not
to
response
--
not
the
responses
of
his
lawyers,
so
the
jury
can
--
can
determine
--
determine
his
demeanor
and
make
its
own
appraisal
of
whether
or
not,
he
is
a
credible
witness
or
not
a
credible
witness.
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh!
yes,
we
think
--
we
think
that
is
a
reasonable
restriction.
the
only
reason
we
would
say
that
ordinarily
it
should
not
be
done
when
you
have
a
defendant,
is
because
you
create
these
problems
which
sometimes
could
arise
even
in
a
post
conviction
proceeding
in
which
there
would
be
a
claim,
well,
there
is
really
something
very
essential
that
we
have
to
talk
about,
and
you
denied
us
a
right
to
talk
and
therefore,
the
case
should
be
reversed
because
you
denied
the
--
defendant
has
been
denied
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
that
is
why
we
do
not
think
this
is
a
--
this
procedure
should
routinely
be
followed.
it
just
happens
in
this
case
uniquely
that
the
lawyer
--
now
most
lawyers
would
not
say
this.
most
lawyers
would
say,
yes,
your
honor,
just
like
this
lawyer
here
said
on
redirect,
i
cannot
--
i
want
to
talk
to
the
client,
i
do
not
think
he
is
ready
for
cross
examination.
i
think
there
is
some
areas
which
i
have
to
refresh
as
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
well
--
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
am
defending
the
judge
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i
am
defending
the
judge’s
decision
in
this
sense.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
well.
well,
let
me
just
say
this.
let
me
back
track—
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
am
defending
the
judge’s
decision.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
am
--
i
am
not
defending
the
practice.
i
am
not
defending
the
practice,
i
do
not
think
that
this
practice
is
--
is
a
desirable
one.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
am
if,
and
if
the
defense
not
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
if
the
defense
counsel
said
i
--
i
--
if
the
defense
counsel
said,
i
want
to
talk
to
him
about
cross
examination,
i
would
concede
that
the
defense
counsel
has
the
right
to
talk
to
him
about
cross
examination.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
just
--
let
me
just
go
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
alright.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
the
denial,
let
me
--
may
be,
i
should
back
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
was
no
prejudice,
that
is
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
order
maybe
constitutionally
alright.
let
me
just
back
it,
the
order
maybe
constitutionally
alright,
i
just
do
not
think
it
is
appropriate
procedure.
the
reason
why
it
might
be
constitutionally
alright
is
because
you
certainly
could
have
gone
forward,
you
could
have
gone
forward
and
tried
the
entire
case
without
any
recesses
and
that
is
what
occurs
in
many
short
cases.
the
defendant
gets
on
and
testifies
and
right
after
he
testifies
and
direct,
he
goes
ahead
with
his
cross,
and
if
he
asks
for
recess,
the
judge
can
say,
oh
you
do
not
need
a
recess,
let
us
finish
it.
so
i
do
not
say
there
is
anything
constitutionally
wrong
with,
maybe
i
just
misunderstood
justice
white’s
question,
i
do
not
see
there
is
anything
constitutionally
wrong
with
that.
what
i
am
saying
,
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
good
practice.
it
is
not
a
good
practice
because
afterwards,
after
the
--
if
there
is
--
in
event
there
is
a
conviction,
you
are
going
to
get
the
claim
that
oh,
you
did
not
let
me
cross
--
talk
to
my
client
about
his
cross
examination
and
that
was
really
something
i
should
have
talked
to
him
about,
and
this
is
something
occurred
because
of
some
sort
of
surprise,
but
apart
--
in
addition
of
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
you
could
show,
if
you
--
well
maybe
it
could
come
up
with
something.
he
maybe
able
to
come
up
with
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh!
yes
you
could
not,
but
usually
--
usually,
if
he
came
up
with
something
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
chances
are,
the
trial
court
will
try
to
ride
it
at
that
particular
point.
so
usually
--
usually
nothing
would
occur
until
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial.
at
that
point
there
will
be
some
second
guessing,
and
then
defense
counsel
or
there
would
be
new
lawyer
in
the
case
and
then
the
claim
would
be
made.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
am
sure,
i
am
sure
that
occurs
your
honor.
i
do
not
how
common
it
is.
i
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh!
i
am
sure,
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
about
the
latter
of
state.
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
when
counsel
puts
witnesses
on
to
testify,
they
certainly
are
cognizance
and
they
consider
when
the
recesses
are
going
to
occur
because
the
some
of
one
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
only
trouble
with
that
is
the
country
judges
do
it,
but
the
city
judges
do
not.
i
had
never
seen
a
city
judge
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
alright
,
alright,
alright.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
you
are
right,
right.
he
as
willing
to
do
it,
but
apparently
neither
counsel
wanted
to
because
defense
counsel
did
not
protest
about
the
recess.
in
fact,
defense
counsel
did
not
say
to
him
look
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
protested
about
the
times
of
the
recess,
but
he
did
not
say
to
judge,
look
this
is
going
to
let
the
government
think
about
cross
examination
overnight
and
we
are
not
going
to
able
to
think
about
it.
he
did
not
--
he
did
not
--
if
he
had
protested
that
way
i
think
the
judge
would
have
gone
forward.
well,
i
just,
from
reading
the
record,
your
honor,
it
is
plain
from
reading
the
record,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge
was
trying
to
be
evenhanded,
but
when
counsel
said
to
the
judge,
look,
i
do
not
want
to
talk
to
him
about
his
testimony.
all
i
want
to
talk
to
him
about
is
what
witnesses
to
call
and
the
court
said,
okay,
well,
you
can
talk
to
him
about
what
witnesses
you
are
going
to
call,
you
can
talk
to
him
right
now
and
in
addition,
if
you
need
an
additional
time,
you
can
talk
to
him
later.
so,
i
think
we
have
a
judge
who
was
trying
to
be
evenhanded,
both
to
the
prosecution
and
the
defense.
now,
we
think
that
if
this
is
error
that
this
is
not
the
type
of
error
which
is
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule,
and
we
think
that
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
if
you
examine
all
of
the
circumstances
and
i
will
recite
them
briefly,
if
there
was
there,
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
the
first
place,
the
limitation
here,
the
restriction
here,
is
not
akin
to
the
denial
of
somebody,
the
right
of
a
lawyer
at
all.
certainly,
in
those
cases
where
a
defendant
has
not
waived
his
right
to
a
lawyer,
the
court
will
not
look
and
decide
whether
it
has
been
prejudiced
or
not.
here
the
limitation
that
the
court
placed
on
the
overnight
recess
is
not
significantly
different
from
the
short
trial
where
the
defendant’s
testimony
may
go
forward
from
commencement
to
conclusion,
covering
direct
and
cross
without
any
recess.
to
the
extent,
that
a
recess
might
have
significance
or
make
a
difference,
since
it
maybe
used
in
trial
preparation,
there
was
no
harm
here
because
counsel
said
he
did
not
need
the
recess
for
--
to
talk
to
his
client
about
his
cross
examination
and
as
far
--
as
far
as
other
matters
are
concerned,
the
court
gave
defense
counsel
opportunity
at
the
beginning
of
the
recess
and
later
on
to
discuss
trial
strategy.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
but
i
thought
the
import
of
the
remark
was,
but
then
when
we
--
but
then
another
reason
we
took
this,
we
interpreted
slightly
different
is
--
is
when
the
counsel
says
to
the
court,
he
has
some
questions
about
trials,
he
has
some
matters
of
trial
strategy,
he
only
--
so
the
court
says
to
counsel,
what
matters
are
those?
and
he
says,
well,
i
might
want
to
talk
him
about,
what
witnesses
to
call
and
from
that
i
think,
you
are
going
to
infer
that
he
did
not
want
to
talk
to
him
about
his
trial
testimony,
otherwise
that
would
have
been
foremost
in
his
mind.
in
addition,
we
think
the
court
should
be
deciding
that
if
there
was
error
--
was
harmless
error,
look
to
the
fact
that
here
we
have,
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
we
have
a
reluctant
counsel
who
was
--
who
was
not
pressing
things
for
the
--
on
behalf
of
his
client.
here,
when
counsel
was
not
reluctant
to
express
his
need
when
he
thought
he
had
talked
to
the
defendant
about
his
testimony,
as
he
did
before
redirect
examination,
and
if
he
had
a
need
--
if
he
had
a
need,
justice
rehnquist
to
discuss
any
testimony,
as
to
what
his
testimony
be
on
cross
i
think
he
would
have
done
the
same
thing
at
this
recess,
as
he
did
in
the
subsequent
recess
which
occurred
the
following
day
at
the
luncheon
time.
finally,
we
have
a
case,
where
we
have
a
court
which
had
concerned
that
the
defendants
have
a
fair
trial.
this
court
freely
granted
recess
just
before
the
defendant
testified.
he
gave
a
recess
for
a
--
to
defense
to
talk
to
a
government
witness,
a
defense
witness.
thereafter
--
shortly
thereafter
counsel
said,
i
would
like
time
to
talk
to
my
defendant
to
decide
whether
the
defendant
should
testify
at
that
point,
counsel
was
given
another
recess.
finally,
the
restrictions
posed
were
no
--
were
not
one-sided.
they
were
posed
on
government
witnesses
and
including
its
case
agents,
and
in
these
circumstances
especially
since
this
--
there
the
--
the
evidence
of
guilt
as
the
court
below
found
was
overwhelming,
we
think
this
court
should
affirm
this
conviction.
