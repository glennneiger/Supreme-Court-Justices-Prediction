justice

marshall
why
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
there
is
a
five
minute
recess,
the
judge
can
tell
you
sit
there
and
do
not
talk
to
anybody
that
is
a
violation
to
somebody’s
rights,
why
do
you
do
that
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
recess
for
the
next
five
minutes,
nobody
talks
to
anybody
and
you
give
reversible
error.
why
do
you
have
to
go
that
far?
you
got
16
hours
in
this
case,
why
do
you
have
to
cut
it
to
five
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
your
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
your

justice

(inaudible)
court
judge
was
really
gone
ahead
without
the
recess,
so
the
question
about
the
judge's
time
is
being
too
--
that
was
what
he
was
getting
ready
to
do,
was
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
continue
with
the
cross
examination,
not
to
recess?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
top
of
page
17?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
we
come
back
to
this,
by
record?
he
says
we
would
prefer
to
recess.
the
court
says
alright,
you
may.
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
stay
a
reasonable
time
which
means
he
was
going
to
proceed?
(voice
overlap)
again
did
move
in
this
--
oh,
no,
we
do
not
want
that,
and
could
it
all
have
been
solved
if
they
just
gone
along
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right
so
the
judge
chose
to
go
the
other
way
and
get
the
whole
long?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
is
suspicious,
you
will
not
get
recess,
he
will
let
you
go
through
to
9
and
10
o’clock
at
night?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
judge
was
getting
ready
to
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
a
city
judge,
was
he
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
protest
about
the
times
of
it?
