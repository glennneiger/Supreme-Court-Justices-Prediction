mr.
seymour
l.
honig
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
seymour
l.
honig.
i
am
an
attorney
form
tampa,
florida.
seated
at
counsel
table
is
richard
h.
mcguinness,
also
an
attorney
from
tampa,
florida.
mr.
mcguinness
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
john
geders.
your
honors,
the
petitioner
is
here
pursuant
to
issuance
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
what
appears
to
be,
a
conflict
between
two
circuits
regarding
the
question
presented
for
review
before
this
honorable
court.
the
matter
on
review
arises
out
of
certain
trial
proceedings,
in
the
united
states
district
court,
middle
district
of
florida,
tampa
division,
in
which
the
petitioner
john
geders
was
on
a
trial
as
a
defendant
charged
with
particular
offenses.
during
the
trial,
the
court
issued
an
across
the
board
incommunicado
order,
prohibiting
the
defendant
from
communicating,
or
having
any
access
to
and
with
his
attorney
during
a
16-hour
overnight
recess
period
between
the
conclusion
of
direct
examination
and
the
conclusion
of
cross
examination
of
the
defendant
himself.
the
role
of
in
factual
situation
your
honors,
as
it
relates
to
the
question
presented
for
review,
commenced
on
the
next
to
the
last
day
of
trial.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
geders
took
the
witness
stand
on
his
own
behalf
and
his
attorney
mr.
rinehart,
who
was
a
defense
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
completed
direct
examination
at
approximately
4:55
p.m.
in
the
afternoon,
a
usual
time
for
recess
in
the
united
states
district
court,
the
middle
district
in
tampa.
however,
in
response
to
a
motion
of
the
prosecutor
mr.
blasingame,
his
honor
judge
klinsmann
decided
to
recess
the
particular
trial
until
the
following
day,
apparently
mr.
blasingame
wanted
to
prepare
as
not
unusual
for
a
cross
examination,
because
there
was
an
extensive
direct
examination
of
the
defendant
in
that
particular
matter.
but
recess
was
not
ordered
your
honors,
before
the
prosecutor,
blasingame
questioned
the
court
with
respect
to
certain
instructions
that
he
desired
that
the
court
issue
to
the
accused
and
his
counsel
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
17
of
the
appendix
at
which
time
mr.
blasingame
stated,
has
this
witness
been
instructed
now
that
he
has
not
to
talk
to
anyone
whatsoever,
including
his
attorneys
or
anyone,
about
this
case
at
all
and
this
is
the
prosecutor
your
honors
addressing
the
court
at
the
time
that
recess
was
going
to
be
ordered
by
the
district
judge.
just
below
that
mr.
rinehart,
in
response
thereto
stated,
if
he
were
instructed
not
to
talk
to
his
attorney,
i
feel
that
it
would
be
improper.
i
think
i
always
have
the
right
to
talk
to
my
client,
of
course
the
emphasis
is
mine,
but
the
words
are
mr.
rinehart’s.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
a
noon
recess,
well,
your
honor
--mr.
justice
this
was
a
situation
where
he
was
denied
16
hours
with
his
counsel.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
it
would
be
your
honor
by
reason
that
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
it
would
be
essentially
the
same
answer
your
honor
because
it
would
be
a
violation
of
a
basic
constitutional
safeguard.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
in
logic,
and
in
practice,
and
in
defense
of
the
constitution,
as
i
see
it
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
if
he
declared
no
recess
and
cross
examination
was
continued
immediately
subsequent
to
direct
examination,
no,
not
at
all
your
honor,
i
would
not
be
here.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
that
is
correct
and
i
would
not
object
to
the
fact
that
counsel
for
the
defense
would
have
not
the
opportunity
to
discuss
anything
with
his
client
during
the
process
of
cross
examination
which
i
will
understand
mr.
justice.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no
not
completely
your
honor.
my
point
is
this
that
the
recess
did
occur,
but
at
the
instance
of
the
government
who
moved
for
it,
not
the
defense.
if
the
recess
and
it
was
granted
then
certainly,
i
would
submit
respectfully
that
defense
counsel
should
not
be
denied
the
right
to
consult
with
his
client
and
this
would
be
most
consistent
with
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
for
one's
defense
pursuant
to
the
sixth
amendment,
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no,
your
honor.
one
does
not
have
the
right.
i
would
say
this
would
be
discretionary
with
the
court
and
i
would
say
that
in
this
particular
situation
the
court
accommodated
the
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
government
--
the
judge,
excuse
me,
the
trial
judge
was
well
prepared
to
continue
with
the
proceedings
and
go
into
cross
examination,
but
the
government
moved
for
recess
because
of
its
reason
to
prepare.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no,
it
would
not
your
honor,
i
submit.
if
the
government,
if
his
honor
at
that
time,
i
sent
it
to
a
recess
then
i
would
submit
that
certainly
counsel
and
the
client
would
have
the
right
to
consult
with
one
another.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
defense
is
making
the
application
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
would
be
here
for
that
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
be.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
defense
witness
mr.
justice
--mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
this
is
defendant
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
defendant,
this
was
not
the
defense
witness,
a
defendant.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
precisely,
that
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
excuse
me,
then
i
misunderstood
you.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
because
i
would
submit
that
this
is
inherent
prejudice.
that
this
inherent
prejudice
that
flows
from
a
violation
of
that
basic
constitutional
safeguard.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
i
cut
it.
this
was
in
response
to
your
colleague's
questions
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
it
would
be
five
minutes,
or
16
hours
my
answer
would
be
much
the
same,
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
sorry.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
not
during
the
trial
proceedings
itself
in
the
midst
of
a
courtroom,
unless
some
undue
occurrence
happen
to
take
place.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
would
submit
that,
a
16
hour
recess,
subsequent
to
a
recess
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceedings
at
which
time
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
has
to
be
present
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
for
meaningful
defense.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no,
your
honor.
no,
excuse
me
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
say
at
all.
coaching
is
not
what
defense
counsel
in
this
case
wanted
to
do.
he
wanted
to
discuss
with
his
client,
this
was
the
next
for
the
last
day
of
trial,
witnesses
who
might
be
called
and
trial
strategy.
this
is
always
something
to
be
discussed
between
attorney
and
client.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
not
actually.
with
all
due
respect
to
judge
klinsmann
who
i
have
great
respect
for,
his
statement
was
really
in
effect
a
sham
because
what
he
stated
to
counsel
was
that
he
was
to
discuss
before
the
bench,
what
witnesses
he
was
going
to
or
planning
to
call.
in
other
words,
consult
with
his
client
with
respect
to
what
witnesses
they
were
going
to
decide
to
call,
really
a
revelation,
matter
of
privilege
matter
before
the
bench
and
then
judge
klinsmann
said,
well,
i
am
not
going
to
sacrifice
this
whole
matter
for
your
strategy.
in
effect,
this
is
what
he
said.
this
is
revealed
in
the
appendix,
and
well,
if
we
need
a
month
after
this,
i
will
give
it
to
you
to
prepare
your
case
or
to
continue
with
strategy,
but
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
talk
to
your
client
at
this
particular
stage,
for
16
hours
or
whatever
time
it
was
until
the
conclusion
of
cross
examination,
the
following
day
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
that.
the
record
reflects
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes.
may
i
refer
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
other
honorable
members
of
this
court
to
page
19
of
the
appendix,
and
it
is
the
fourth,
which
is
the
court
the
fourth
time
the
court
speaks
in
the
third
paragraph.
i
think
you
might
ask
him
right
now,
right
here
while
we
are
here,
what
witnesses
he
thinks
you
ought
to
call
in
the
morning.
now,
i
would
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
trial
judge
is
treating
this
situation
as
a
fishbowl
situation.
he
has
the
defense
counsel
before
him
with
his
client,
with
the
defendant
and
he
says
if
you
wanted
to
call
witnesses
in
the
morning,
discuss
it
right
here
and
we
will
get
on,
but
that
you
are
not
going
to
talk
with
each
other
and
have
any
communication
with
each
other,
until
the
termination
of
cross
examination
the
following
day.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
well,
i
submit
your
honor
that
this
is
a
basic
constitutional
safeguard.
the
right
of
assistance
of
counsel
and
this
is
the
basis
and
the
ground
of
our
argument.
the
right
of
assistance
to
counsel
for
one’s
defense
and
it
does
not
only,
we
respectfully
submit,
prevail
in
a
courtroom,
but
outside
of
a
courtroom
as
well.
the
eve
of
the
last
day
of
trial
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
proceeding
where
defense
counsel
and
we
respectfully
submit
sir
and
his
client,
have
every
right
to
discuss
trial
strategy
and
the
calling
of
witnesses
or
whatever
in
preparing
for
the
following
day
trial.
i
think
that
every
trial
lawyer
has
done
this.
i
find
that
the
evenings
are
in
most
critical
in
any
stage
of
trial,
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
begging
the
court’s
pardon,
that
was
not
my
hypothetical,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
if
the
defendant
were
told
to
remain
on
the
stand
and
the
jury
was
removed
and
what
happened,
i
do
not
quite
follow
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
and
that,
well
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
is
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
the
defendant
witness
is
there
and
there
is
a
ten
minute
recess
in
effect
because
the
jury
is
out
and
the
judge
is
not
out
of
the
courtroom,
he
is
there.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
he
is
technically,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
correct
ruling
on
the
trial
judge.
it
would
be
questionable,
but
i
would
tend
to
say
that
would
be
a
correct
ruling.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
not
left
the
witness
stand
between
direct
and
cross
examination.
he
is
still
in
the
midst
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
this
is
quite
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
most
respectfully
submit
that
no
trial
judge
in
united
states
has
any
discretion
with
which
to
violate
a
basic
constitutional
safeguard
and
that
is
precisely
my
answer.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes
sir.
your
honors,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
--
oh!
yes,
the
government
in
its
appeal,
in
its
brief
to
the
fifth
circuit,
i
feel
and
i
submit
has
misled
the
court
to
some
measure
in
that
they
confuse
the
issue
your
honors
by
indicating
that
the
prohibition
between
the
counsel
and
the
defendant
was
a
limited
prohibition,
only
relating
to
the
prohibition
with
respect
to
discussing
testimony
when
in
fact
of
course
this
was
an
across
the
board
incommunicado
order,
or
a
totally
incommunicado
order.
no
reason,
no
--
no
consulting
whatsoever
about
anything,
and
the
next
day
when
the
court
did
resit,
the
court
stated
to
mr.
rinehart
as
appears
on
page
20,
questioned
him
i
should
say,
you
have
not
talked
with
him
of
course,
have
you?
and
mr.
rinehart
says,
no
i
have
not
and
this
would
clear
of
any
doubt
as
to
the
limitation
or
the
narrow
prohibition
regarding
the
incommunicado
order,
it
was
in
fact
total
and
complete.
counsel
was
not
permitted
to
talk
to
his
client,
the
defendant
at
all
for
period
of
what
appeared
to
be
16
hours.
we
would
respectfully
submit
your
honors,
that
there
are
certain
matters
which
are
self-evident
and
basic
and
dealing
with
the
question
presented
for
review
and
they
are
one
and
i
submit
that
self-evident
in
basic
is
that
error
was
committed
by
the
trial
judge.
secondly,
that
the
error
was
a
constitutional
error.
thirdly
in
self-evident
and
basic,
we
would
urge,
is
that
the
federal
constitutional
error
was
one
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
portion
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
was
violated,
was
that
part
which
pertains
to
the
right
of
assistance
of
counsel
for
one’s
defense.
and
lastly,
we
would
urge
that
this
violation,
that
this
federal
constitutional
violation
occurred
during
the
critical
stage
of
the
proceedings,
namely
during
the
trial
itself,
between
the
termination
of
direct
examination
of
the
defendant
and
the
termination
or
conclusion
of
cross
examination
of
the
defendant
the
following
day
by
the
government
prosecutor.
we
would
further
submit
that
the
denial
of
right
to
consult
with
counsel
for
a
16-hour
period
of
time
is
in
contravention
to
a
basic
constitutional
safeguard
and
as
such
is
inherently
prejudicial,
inherently
prejudicial
and
is
per
se,
reversible
error.
in
support
of
this
position,
the
petitioner
relies
upon
glasser
versus
united
states.
powell
v.
alabama,
hamilton
v.
alabama,
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
argesinger
versus
hamlin
and
sir,
oh!
i
am
sorry.
these
cases
we
submit,
all
pertain
to
the
denial
of
assistance
of
counsel
for
one’s
defense
and
we
would
further
submit
as
we
have
before
that
the
denial
of
assistance
of
counsel
for
one’s
defense
in
each
of
the
above
cases,
from
powell
v
alabama
through
argesinger
v
hamlin
was
deemed
inherently
prejudicial
and
was
per
se
reversible
error.
in
the
glasser
case
without
going
into
any
quotations,
the
court
considered
that
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
was
so
fundamental
and
absolute
right
that
the
courts
could
not
indulge
in
nice
calculations
as
to
the
amount
of
prejudice
arising
form
the
denial
and
we
would
submit
that,
that
is
correct.
we
further
contend
your
honors,
that
the
rule
of
harmless
error
as
promulgated
in
chapman
v.
california
is
irrelevant
and
inappropriate
to
the
question
presented
for
review.
we
would
submit
your
honors,
that
the
harmless
error
rule
applies
to
the
evaluation
and
measurement
of
the
prejudicial
quality
and
quantity
if
any,
of
tainted
evidence
admitted
in
the
trial
of
an
accused.
but
the
harmless
error
rule,
we
would
submit,
is
not
applied
in
measuring
prejudice
which
inherently
flows
from
the
violation
or
from
the
denial
of
a
basic
constitutional
safeguard.
we
urge
that
the
harmless
error
rule,
as
promulgated
in
chapman
v.
california
does
not
apply
nor
can
it
realistically
apply
to
a
violation
of
a
basic
constitutional
safe
guard.
this
court
has
recently
dealt
with
harmless
error
cases
in
hamilton
v.
state
of
california
and
milton
v.
wainwright.
i
would
submit
two
very
typical
cases
where
a
harmless
error
has
been
applied
and
in
both
cases,
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
admission
of
tainted
evidence,
if
you
would,
or
a
testimony,
but
in
the
face
of
which
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
to
convict
and
so
this
was
deemed
by
the
court
to
be
a
harmless
constitutional
error,
but
the
chapman
v.
california
doctrine
puts
the
burden
of
proof
above
and
beyond
the
exclusion
of
all
reasonable
doubt
as
you
have
it
in
any
criminal
proceeding
upon
the
government
to
establish
the
absence
of
prejudice
or
harmless
error.
it
would
be
impossible,
we
submit
for
the
government
to
at
all
put
forth
such
proof
in
this
particular
case
nor
have
that
and
not
having
done
so
that
certainly
could
not
be
considered
harmless
--
they
certainly
have
not
met
their
burden
with
respect
to
the
harmless
error
doctrine.
the
fifth
circuit,
we
submit,
was
in
error.
one,
they
not
only
misapplied
the
chapman
case,
we
submit,
they
should
not
have
applied
chapman
case
to
the
particular
ruling
that
they
made
in
this
case,
but
that
they
misinterpreted
it
as
well.
chapman
is
very
clear,
i
will
submit
your
honor,
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
prove
above
any
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
an
absence
of
prejudice
or
harmless
error
and
this
is
to
protect
them.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
would
submit
that
if
i
was
asked
to
do
that,
that
we
would
be
flying
in
the
face
of
chapman,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
for
this
reason
your
honor
that
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
oh!
i
say
that
we
could
make
such
a
showing,
your
honor,
but
to
make
such
a
showing,
it
would
reveal
privileged
matter,
cause
to
reveal
privilege
matter.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
well,
if
the
court
has
asked
to
me
to
do
something
which
i
considered
to
be
unconstitutional
then
i
--
if
i
am
ordered
to
do
so,
i
would
have
got
something
(voice
overlap).
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
well,
yes
your
honor.
may
i
make
it
on
three
points.
one
and
i
do
not
want
to
sing
the
old
song.
again,
i
say
it
is
inherently
prejudicial,
pursuant
to
the
glasser
versus
united
states
decision.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
that
is
right,
there
is
no
shoeing
at
all
because
prejudice
in
here
is
in
the
act.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
that
is
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
oh,
i
am
not
fencing.
i
believe
that
i
can
show
it
right
now,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
i
would
be
very
happy
to
answer.
the
defense
counsel
at
this
trial
stated
very
specifically
and
i
could
refer
the
court
to
the
particular
quotation
here
where
he
states
that
he
wants
to
discuss
with
his
client
the
calling
of
witnesses
and
also
the
discussion,
he
wants
to
have
a
discussion
of
trial
strategy
with
his
client,
i
would
say
this
is
per
se
reversible
error,
in
view
the
fact
that
he
has
been
prejudiced.
i
think
that
i
would
submit
that
he
has
this
inviolable
right,
this
to
have
a
discussion
of
trial
strategy
and
the
calling
of
witnesses
with
his
client.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no,
your
honor,
i
would
submit,
then
would
not.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
the
only
thing
that
revealed
--
that
is
revealed
on
the
record
is
that
the
defense
counsel
did
want
to
discuss
with
him
matters
of
witnesses
and
trial
strategy
which
takes
in
the
whole
spectrum
of
things,
i
respectfully
submit.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
it
would
depend
upon
the
trial
strategy
and
the
recess
and
the
witnesses
that
they
would
want
to
call.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
not
to
coach
his
witness,
never
to
coach
his
witness,
your
honor.
that
would
be
possibly
suborning
perjury,
no,
no.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
not
to
coach
a
witness
your
honor,
but
to
discuss
with
him
to
have
the
assistance
of
one’s
client
and
counsel.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
would
say
that
not
necessarily,
your
honor
because
things
can
happen
between
that
particular
time.
i
would
not
conceive
of
what
could
happen,
but
there
are
things
that
conceivably
occur
that
might
be
vital
to
that
trial
and
it
would
be
a
critical
stage
of
the
trial.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
between
direct
and
cross
examination
providing
to
be
a
24
hour,
a
period
of
recess
given
after
that.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
there
might
be
a
witness
who
would
be
leaving
town
or
witnesses
who
may
be
leaving
the
city
and
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
them
called
immediately
and
have
them
subpoenaed,
so
they
will
be
there
tomorrow
on
the
court
order.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
well,
it
just
might
be
that
these
people
may
not
be
locatable
the
following
day
and
so
that
particular
time,
they
might
be
necessary.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
well,
your
honor,
may
i
without
being
evasive
to
your
hypothetical,
may
i
just
raise
this
hypothetical
with
due
respect.
if
the
court
looking
at
the
defense
counsel,
said
i
do
not
like
the
way
you
part
your
hear.
so,
consequently
thereof,
you
are
not
to
discuss
this
case
with
your
client
until
the
termination
of
cross
examination
and
then
after
that
i
will
let
you
have
24
hours
to
discuss
the
case
with
him.
would
there
be
any
difference
there
your
honor?
i
doubt
it.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
this
your
honor,
i
believe
that
if
the
court
affirms
the
ruling
of
the
lower
court
here,
it
would
lay
a
potential
ground
for
the
opening
of
a
floodgate
of
possible
judicial
wrongdoing.
i
consider
this
judicial
wrongdoing.
the
court
has
asked
me
what
could
possibly
happen
between
the
conclusion
of
direct
examination
and
the
conclusion
of
cross
examination,
providing
counsel
and
his
attorney
are
not
allowed
to
consult
and
providing
that
there
will
be
a
24
hour
recess
period
after
that.
i
would
mention
just
one
item.
it
could
be
that
he
--
without
coaching
him,
he
might
review
what
questions
he
thinks
the
government
might
propound
to
him
on
cross
examination
without
giving
him
the
answers.
he
say,
well,
perhaps
the
government
may
ask
you
a,b,c,d,
and
e,
because
this
would
be
logical
for
them
to
do
so,
so
you
should
be
ready
and
on
your
guard
with
respect
to
proper
and
honest
answers
in
response
to
those
questions
and
i
think
that,
that
might
be
quite
necessary
at
that
point
to
discuss
it.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
providing,
yes
your
honor,
providing
that
there
will
be
a
recess,
yes,
not
if
there
was
a
continuum
from
direct
to
cross
examination,
i
would
admit
that
certainly,
he
would
not
have
a
right
to
consult
with
his
client
at
that
particular
time,
but
if
there
was
a
recess
and
especially,
one,
that
is
called
or
moved
it
by
the
instance
of
the
government,
then
certainly
he
would
have
this
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
well,
only
because
it
happened
in
this
case
that
way,
but
it
would
apply
in
any
other
situation,
i
would
respectfully
submit
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
the
trial
judge
prohibited
counsel
from
discussing
any
matter
or
discussing
matters
across
the
board
with
his
client
during
the
course
of
a
trial
whether
the
defendant
took
the
stand
or
not,
my
position
would
be
the
same
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
that
is
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
after
the
direct
examination
of
the
defendant?
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
of
course,
i
would
have
a
full
right
to
discuss
and
to
consult
with
my
client,
during
the
process
of
that
direct
examination
and
the
overnight
recess
of
course.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
would
say
your
honor,
that
a
“critical
stage”
of
the
proceedings
any
stage
wherein,
if
there
is
not
assistance
of
counsel,
accused
may
well
be
denied
or
will
not
receive
a
fair
trial
in
due
process
of
law.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
yes,
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
even
if
it
is
for
five
minutes
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
any
stage
of
the
trial
is
a
critical
stage
and
that
is
a
stage
where
meaningful
defense
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
would
submit
that
it
is
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
well,
every
stage
is
a
critical
stage
of
the
--
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
not
at
that
stage,
but
if
the
trial
judge
ordered
the
attorney
out
of
the
courtroom
and
said,
now
he
will
be
crossed
examined
without
you
being
there,
that
certainly
would
be
the
denial
of
his
right
of
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
not
if
he
is
being
tendered
forthwith
for
cross
examination,
no
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
i
think
it
is
critical
for
justices,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
do
not
see
any
wrongdoing
and
certainly
we
have
had
this
in
the
state
courts
for
years
and
this
is
the
first
time,
i
ever
heard
of
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
must
confess
my
ignorance
wherein
there
was
prohibition
on
the
part
of
counsel
and
his
client
from
discussing
any
matters
between
the
conclusion
of
direct
and
the
conclusion
of
cross
examination.
however,
if
any
federal
judges
feel
this
way
about
it,
then
certainly
they
can
commence
direct
the
following
day
or
they
can
choose
just
to
allow
as
i
would
submit
is
correct,
defense
counsel
and
defendant,
to
consult
with
one
another
over
night.
i
would
say
this
is
quite
consistent
with
our
federal
constitution.
mr.
seymour
l.
honig
no.
i
am
not
your
honor.
thank
you,
very
much
mr.
justice,
and
honorable
members
of
the
court.
