(inaudible)
making
the
annotation,
granted,
provided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
judge
said
granted,
provided
that
you
do
not
talk
to
your
client
during
the
recess?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
right,
the
assistance
of
counsel
has
been
violated,
there
is
simply
no
room
for
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
are
you
fencing
it
up
whether
you
could
or
could
not
show
it
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
not
saying
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
read
judge’s,
and
court’s
opinions.
the
court
of
appeals
has
limited
and
you
suggest
that
he
made
a
request
as
he
had
earlier
at
the
noon
recess,
because
he
wanted
to
talk
with
his
client
about
cross
examination.
i
do
not
read
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
denying
that
would
have
been
error
and
as
i
understand
your
argument
you
do
say
that
the
denying
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
how
about
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
do
not
think,
it
can
be
read
as,
as
saying
you
are
entitled
--
that
the
order,
if
it
had
gone
so
far
as
to
forbid
you
to
talk
with
your
client
about
his
cross
examination,
as
saying
if
that
would
be
alright?
