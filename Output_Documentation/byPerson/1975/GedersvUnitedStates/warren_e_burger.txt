chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
geders
against
the
united
states,
5968.
mr.
honig
you
may
proceed,
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying
that
the
trial
judge
has
no
discretion
or
whatever
to
limit
the
conversations
of
the
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
under
cross
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
trial
judge
had
said
in
taking
your
short
recess
hypothetical
case,
if
the
judge
had
said
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
no,
i
thought
that
you
were
addressing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
to
have
a
great
range
of
hypothetical
to
test
by
analogy
of
the
arguments
being
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
if
the
judge
said,
the
jury
maybe
excused
and
everyone
else,
both
counsel
will
remain
in
the
courtroom
and
the
witness
will
remain
on
the
stand
as
was
suggested
before.
you
think
you
have
then
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
we
are
going
to
take
it,
the
jury
is
excused
for
ten
minutes,
but
the
witness
who
is
now
under
examination
will
remain
on
the
witness
stand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
defendant
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
let
us
say
the
judge
leaves
the
courtroom,
but
says
let
us
pursue
that.
you
will
remain
on
the
witness
stand
and
counsel,
you
will
not
consult
with
them
during
this
recess?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
purpose
of
all
this
is
of
course
very
clear,
is
it
not?
the
discretion
vested
in
trial
judges
to
see
that
witnesses
are
not
coached
before
they
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
cross
examination
by
the
opposing
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
do
not
agree
on
that
fine
generality,
i
am
sure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
judge
klinsmann
had
said
and
when
the
objections
came
from
defense
counsel
that
if
you
need
time
for
this
final
roundup
before
the
close
of
the
trial,
the
order
will
stand,
but
i
will
give
you
a
recess
of
as
long
as
you
want.
one
day,
two
days,
whatever
you
need
after
the
cross
examination
is
completed,
would
that
take
care
of
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
does
that
narrow
it
down
that
--
you
may
think
that
the
defense
counsel
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
that
night
with
his
cross
examination
the
following
day?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
all
that
be
done
in
this
hypothetical
recess
that
i
have
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
will
remind
you,
you
are
at
the
end
of
the
day,
at
the
end
of
the
court
day,
the
judge
says
you
cannot
talk
to
this
man
about
his
cross
examination
tomorrow,
but
if
you
need
24
hours
after
that
to
plan
of
closing
stages
of
the
trial,
the
court
will
give
it
to
you,
that
would
not
cure
the
error
that
you
see?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
does
that
not
narrow
the
proposition
down
that
you
are
really
arguing
for
a
constitutional
right
for
a
defense
counsel
to
coach
his
witness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
any
consequence
of
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
back
to
the
hypothetical
then.
the
judge
said,
he
would
give
him
the
24
hours
recess
after
the
cross
examination,
would
that
not
give
you
everything
that
you
say
was
going
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
consultation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
just
give
a
hint
as
to
what
one
them
might
be?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
purpose
of
doing
all
the
tings
that
you
said
that
were
imperative
to
be
done
during
a
15
hour?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
courtâ€™s
powers
are
pretty
broad
about
subpoenas,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
suggesting
that,
that
is
something
beyond
a
remedy,
bringing
--
bringing
them
in
the
courtroom
and
have
them
sitting
there,
or
in
an
ante
room
as
long
as
you
want
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
what
that
has
do
with
the
hypothetical
question
i
put
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
consultation
relating
to
the
cross
examination;
now
i
do
not
suggest
by
that
question
that
there
is
anything
unethical
about
consultation.
i
am
simply
putting
it
to
you.
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
consult
with
the
defendant
before
the
cross
examination
begins
relating
to
the
scope
of
the
cross
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
constitutional
right
that
you
are
urging
is
one
that
depends
on
fortuity
of
the
time
of
the
day,
the
point
in
the
trial
when
direct
examination
begins?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
glazer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
witnesses
being
crossed
examined
as
is
not
unusual
for
3,
4,
5,
6
days,
you
think
the
court
could
say
that
during
the
time
of
the
cross
examination
is
continuing,
you
may
not
consult?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
is
not
common,
the
judge
--
trial
judge
has
or
he
thinks
he
has
reason
to
doubt
whether
a
witness
is
going
to
be
improperly
coached
that
he
will
say
we
will
not
begin
the
direct
examination
until
the
beginning
of
the
court
session,
in
someway
that
he
can
plan
it
out,
is
that
not
a
common
thing
for
judges
to
do?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
it
is
probably
quite
common
for
defense
counsel
putting
a
witness
on
the
stand
to
try
to
have
it
fall,
so
that
you
will
have
a
recess
to
talk
to
the
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
74-5968
geders

the
united
states,
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
reversed.
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
that
circuit
with
directions
that

be
remanded
in
turn
to

district
court
for
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall,
with
whom
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
