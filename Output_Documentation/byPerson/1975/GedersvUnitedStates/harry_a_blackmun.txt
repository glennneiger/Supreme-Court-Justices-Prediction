justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thin
at
this
point,
let
is
follow
through
on
that.
suppose
this
were
noon
recess,
the
same
answer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
i
am
talking
about
the
noon
recess
of
one
hour,
would
your
answer
be
the
same?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
it
were
rest
and
relaxation
period
to
allow
the
jury
to
go
to
bathroom
five
minutes,
same
answer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
logic
you
have
to
give
that
answer
(inaudible)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
suppose
that
the
judge
here
had
said,
we
will
finish
with
this
witness
tonight,
declared
no
recess,
would
you
be
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
it
continued
well
past
your
closing
time
in
the
middle
district
division?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
your
right
to
discuss
is
not
absolutely
depends
on
the
accident
of
the
recess?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
the
right
to
insist
on
a
recess
between
direct
and
cross
examination
at
all
times?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
it
make
a
difference
if
you
had
requested
the
recess?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
honig?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand
why
you
feel
this
is
a
very
critical
case,
it
is
critical
for
your
client?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
that
you
prevail
here
and
we
reverse,
is
the
ultimate
result
not
going
to
be
what
i
suggested
in
my
first
question,
namely
that
federal
judges
will
just
not
call
a
recess,
until
the
cross
is
complete.
either
that
or
they
would
not
start
with
the
defendant
if
he
chooses
to
take
the
stand
unless
they
can
finish
him
up
and
want
to
go
around.
now,
what
is
going
to
happen,
if
it
is
a
long
session
for
two
or
three
days,
that
is
something
else
again
maybe?
is
this
not
the
ultimate,
what
you
are
guiding
federal
judges
to
do,
if
you
prevail?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
last
question,
neither
you
and
our
government
has
cited
the
manes
case
of
last
term
here,
are
you
familiar
with
that?
