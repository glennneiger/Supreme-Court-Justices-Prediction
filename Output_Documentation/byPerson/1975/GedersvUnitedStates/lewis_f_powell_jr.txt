justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
referred
several
times
in
your
argument
and
in
your
brief
to
this
event
having
occurred
at
a
critical
stage
in
the
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yeah,
so
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
recess
had
taken
place
10
to
15
minutes,
or
half
an
hour
after
the
commencement
of
a
direct
examination
of
defendant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
just
started
the
direct
examination
and
you
plan
to
examine
him
for
a
day
or
two,
recess
occurs
shortly
after
you
commenced,
over
night
recess,
what
is
you
position
on
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
how
would
you
limit
your
use
of
the
phrase
“critical
stage”
in
the
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
not
really
saying
that
any
time
the
court
is
in
recess
that
defense
counsel
has
the
right
to
confer
with
his
client?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
there
is
no
significance
really
to
your
talking
about
a
critical
stage?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
at
any
stage?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
whenever
you
have
a
recess
and
the
defendant
is
involved
in
criminal
case,
the
stage
is
critical
in
your
view?
