do
you
think
--
the
judge
did
not
agree
with
that
position
herein,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
not
really
defending
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
judgeâ€™s
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
the
way
he
put
it
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
can
you
answer
yes,
or
no,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
not
defending
the
decision
he
made,
what
he
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
defending
--
you
are
not
defending
the
district
judge
if
he
said,
well
you
can
confer,
but
you
cannot
confer
about
cross
examination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
just
said
that
you
are
not
defending
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
district
judge
had
a
wholly
different
view
in
this
case?
