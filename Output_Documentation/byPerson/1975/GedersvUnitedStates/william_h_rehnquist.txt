defense
witness
or
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
you
concede
that
the
defense
counsel
does
not
have
a
right
to
insist
that
cross
be
interrupted,
cross
of
his
client
on
the
stand,
in
order
that
he
may
confer
with
him
for
a
few
minutes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
right
of
consultation
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
is
not
an
absolute?
it
cannot
be
demanded
at
anytime
during
the
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel,
the
coach
demand
on
what
to
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(voice
overlap)
allow
that
sort
of
a
consultation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
not
judge
klinsmann
in
his
order
allow
that
sort
of
consultation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that
judge
klinsmann
would
not
permit
mr.
rinehart
and
the
defendant
to
confer
about
order
of
witnesses
even
for
five
minutes
outside
of
the
judges’
presence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page
are
you
referring
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
see
that
is
a
pretty
ambiguous
colloquy
to
ask
us
to
reverse
a
judgment
after
a
completed
trial.
if
you
concede
that
had
it
been
out
of
the
court’s
presence,
it
would
have
done
alright?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
chapman
you
are
talking
about
evidence
which
ultimately
got
into
the
trial
which
should
have
been
excluded,
so
you
have
something
factual
that
the
government
can
at
least
go
ahead
and
start
evaluating
and
say
it
could
not
have
made
any
difference.
here
all
you
have
is
the
absence
for
a
period
of
a
time
of
a
right
to
consult
between
the
defendant
and
his
counsel.
now,
supposing
in
that
sort
of
a
case,
this
court
would
say
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forth
--
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
showing
that
it
might
have
been
prejudicial
is
up
to
you,
well,
what
showing
would
you
make
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
are
saying
that
that
you
could
not
make
any
such
showing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
say
that
you
could
not
make
any
such
showing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
at
any
rate
--
at
any
rate
you
are
unwilling
to
do
so
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
individual
justice
of
the
court
has
powered
to
order
you
to
do
anything.
all
i
am
asking
is,
is
there
anything
you
would
wish
to
disclose
to
the
court
as
to
why
this
might
in
anyway
have
hurt
--
hurt
your
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
is
no
showing
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
i
asked
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
the
end
of
direct
for
a
defendant
on
the
stand
and
the
shift
to
cross
is,
you
know,
in
the
contemplation
of
most
trial,
is
a
very,
very
critical
stage.
all
of
a
sudden
you
stop
getting
questions
from
the
attorney
that
is
friendly
to
you,
and
you
get
under
questions
from
attorney
hostile
to
you
and
by
your
definition
if
there
is
no
recess
at
that
point,
that
is
not
a
critical
stage
of
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
not
entitled
to
--
you
are
not
entitled
to
consult
with
counsel
at
that
stage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
trial
judge
simply
says,
we
had
a
recess
an
hour-and-a-half
ago
and
no
need
for
a
recess,
now
we
will
go
into
cross,
even
it
is
a
critical
stage,
but
the
defendant
has
no
right
to
consult
with
his
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
government’s
position
mr.
glazer,
if
the
client
--
if
the
lawyer
had
said,
i
do
want
the
recess
to
talk
to
my
client
about
his
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
not
raise
that
kind
of
a
claim,
where
you
could
show
a
constitutional
violation,
i
would
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
could
come
up
something
on
a
habeas,
you
could
not
come
up
with
something
on
the
direct,
i
would
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
glazer,
actually,
on
page
18
of
the
appendix,
as
i
read
what
counsel
said,
the
bottom
of
page
18,
i
feel
i
do
not
--
i
feel
i
do
have
the
right
to
confer
with
him,
but
not
coach
him
as
to
what
he
may
say
on
a
cross
examination
on
how
to
answer
questions?
now,
that
is
a
little
bit
different
i
would
think
than
you
--?
