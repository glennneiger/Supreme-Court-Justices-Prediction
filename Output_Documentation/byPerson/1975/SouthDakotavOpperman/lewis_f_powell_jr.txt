practice
varied
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
car
door
is
a
locked?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
stated
it
is
a
purpose,
a
primary
purpose
in
any
event
of
the
inventory
search
is
to
safeguard
valuables.
would
you
say
that
a
secondary
purpose
of
the
search
would
be
to
discover
evidence
of
crime?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

do
you
think
the
watch
on
the
dash
board,
being
in
plain
view,
supplied
the
element
of
reasonableness
that
you
mentioned?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
instead
of
a
wrist
watch
on
the
dashboard
there
had
been
a
beautiful
diamond
broche.
would
that
make
any
difference?
would
that
justified
entry
to
protect
it?
