mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
very
well
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
pertaining
to
the
factual
situation
that
mr.
janklow
is
tried
to
be
the
elements,
it
is
such
factual
situation
involving
this
particular
case.
well,
i
basically
agree
with
the
facts
as
presented.
i
feel
it
is
imperative
for
analyzation,
proper
analyzation
of
this
case
that
certain
facts
which
are
contained
and
a
record
again
be
brought
to
your
attention.
those
are
that
the
record
clearly
shows
that
this
particular
vehicle
wore
current
south
dakota
license
plate
at
the
time
of
the
initial
seizure
from
the
streets
of
vermillion
occurred.
the
record
also
clearly
establishes
the
fact
that
the
officer
towing
the
vehicle
or
the
officer
who
had
the
vehicle
towed
made
no
attempt
to
contact
the
owner,
made
no
attempt
to
ascertain
who
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
was
prior
the
time
which
he
discovered
in
the
close
glove
compartment
after
he
had
broken
into
the
automobile
with
the
use
of
the
tool.
after
--
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
i
think
the
argument
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall
would
be
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
it
can
all
but
there
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
but
i
think
perhaps
the
scope
of
this
decision
would
be
in
the
areas
where
perhaps
the
owner
would
be
present
at
the
time
the
initial
seizure
occurred
and
the
argument
that
i
wish
to
make,
and
i
feel
that
this
particular
fact
should
be
brought
on,
if
mr.
opperman
were
present
when
they
have
towed
his
car,
he
should
have
been
given
the
opportunity
or
preference
at
least
some
choice
to
whatever
you
want
his
automobile
is
search.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
the
automobile
was
—
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
the
automobile
was
left
there
due
to
a
malfunction
in
the
automobile;
it
was
not
there
by
choice.
it
was
there
as
a
resulted
bad
battery.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
are
not
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
we
are
not,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
are
not
arguing
the
position
that
the
initial
seizure
in
this
case
was
improper.
we
concede
that
the
initial
seizure,
under
the
ordinance
of
the
city,
was
proper.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
i
do
not
want
to
insist
that
it
be
done.
i
only
wanted
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
for
the
court’s
purpose
that
if
the
situation
does
occur
where
the
owner
is
present
at
the
time
the
initial
seizure
takes
place
that
he
should
be
given
some
type
of
preference
to
whether
he
wants
his
automobile
searched,
and
that
is
the
only
reason
why
i
raised
that
fact.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
a
necessity
for
that.
now
i
am
somewhat
lost
for
that
answer
because
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
our
state
law
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
our
state
law
does
not
require
that
you
keep
your
registration
in
your
vehicle.
it
only
requires
that
you
have
it
in
your
person
or
in
your
presence
the
time
of
vehicle’s
being
operated.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
so,
in—
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
i
only
brought
that
fact
to
light
again
mr.
chief
justice
is
for
the
court’s
attention
that
if
the
situation
would
arise
as
a
result
of
this
holding
a
rule
or
law
which
would
be
the
establishment
by
holding
of
this
case
that
if
the
owner
is
present,
perhaps
the
best
way
to
handle
is
protection
of
his
privacy
and
the
protection
of
his
property
argument,
would
be
the
give
him
the
preference.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
that
is
my
position
mr.
chief
justice.
the
record
also
establishes
in
this
case
that
they
could
--
that
the
identity
of
the
owner
was
detected
after
the
time
the
seizure
are
occurred,
the
seizure
of
the
criminal
evidence,
of
the
automobile.
but,
it
was
very
easy
for
the
vermillion
police
department
to
detect
who
the
owner
of
this
automobile
was.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
pardon?
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
they
radio
the
state
bureau
of
motor
vehicles,
and
it
takes
about
three
minutes
to
determine
who
the
registered
owner
of
that
vehicle
would
be.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
am
saying
they
have
no
right
to
take
that
step
because
they
would
have
no
expectation
of
finding
this
particular
document
in
the
automobile.
it
is
not
required
to
be
present
in
the
automobile.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
i
think
the
better
argument
be
rather
than
do
breaking
into
the
automobile
with
the
use
of
a
tool,
and
perhaps
going
one
more
step
further
in
this
argument
if
the
glove
compartment
was
locked
also
breaking
into
that,
particular
closed
area
that
it
would
be
much
easier
to
pick
up
the
radio
on
a
police
unit
and
radio
into
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
and
have
your
answer
back
in
three
minutes.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
did
not
argue
the
point
mr.
justice
marshall
that
there
is
a
duty
to
notify.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
i
think
this
is
what
the
state’s
argument
goes
to
either.
they
are
staying
at
the
entry
into
the
closed
area
of
this
compartment.
an
area
which
we
argue
is
an
area
of
expectation
of
privacy
was
done
to
be
nice.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
the
close
compartment
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
this
is
an
area
that
the
record
is
unclear.
i
do
not
even
know
if
this
automobile
was
capable
of
locking
the
console
and
i
know
in
my
automobile
i
cannot
lock
my
console.
i
do
not
have
a
lock
guard.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
i
do
not
see
any
distinction
between
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
rather
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
think
it
would
be
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
agree.
but
of
that
purpose
of
that
argument
or
purpose
of
addition
of
that
fact
was
only
for
the
point
mr.
marshall
to
notify
the
court
that
perhaps
in
further
situations,
if
the
individuals
present,
he
should
have
been
given
the
opportunity
or
the
choice
which
particular
means
he
would
wish
to
exercise
to
protect
his
property.
and
that
is
the
only
limited
purpose
again
for
bringing
that
to
the
court’s
attention.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
i
agree
that
it
is.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
my
position
is
the
only
way
that
they
could
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
car
after
the
initial
seizure
would
be
to
follow
one
of
the
prescribed
exceptions,
automobile
exceptions
for
the
warrant
requirement
on
a
consent
search.
now,
if
the
individual
is
present,
that
the
police
officer
did
ask
him
which
would
be
your
preference
and
the
individual
consent
it
to
the
entry
and
the
seizure
of
any
items
within
the
automobile.
that
would
be
the
only
two
areas
were
my
argument
would
allow
police
to
enter
and
search.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
it
would
be
unreasonable.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
time
element.
if
no
one
showed
to
claim
the
impounded
automobile
within
a
reasonable
time
that
the
police
under
somewhat
of
an
argument
presented
in
the
cooper
decision,
time
element
where
the
police
were
allowed
to
search
car
after
they
have
custody
for
one
week.
this
time
element
argument
would
then
come
in
to
play.
that
would
give
them
--
it
would
give
the
police
department
some
reasonable
justification
at
that
time
perhaps
to
enter
the
automobile
and
search.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
think
in
the
stolen
vehicle
type
argument,
perhaps
it
still
not
be
search,
in
those
arguments,
the
police
are
going
and
notify
the
owner
of
the
recovery
of
this
automobile.
he
should
then
be
given
the
preference
whether
the
automobile
be
searched.
now
again,
there
is
all
kind
of
extensions
in
this
area
that
we
will
allow
a
search
but
i
would
not
wish
comment
at
all.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
i
guess
that
is
basically
what
my
argument.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes.
but,
pursuing
the
matter
of
early
cases
which
you
have
been
referred
to
by
the
state
in
the
manner
--
the
state
in
their
argument
does
place
reliance
upon
a
decision
of
this
court
in
cady
versus
dombrowski.
my
argument
is
to
the
interpretation
of
that
case
and
the
proper
interpretation
of
that
case
would
be
to
examine
the
factual
situation
contains
in
cady.
a
factual
situation
where
the
individual
was
intoxicated,
later
unconscious
and
hospitalized,
his
automobile
in
an
accident,
constituting
a
nuisance
the
automobile
being
impounded,
the
police
officer
impounding
the
vehicle
pursuant
to
somewhat
of
a
police
regulation,
which
would
require
them
to
conduct
an
inventory.
the
record
in
that
case
are
not
quite
familiar
with
what
their
regulation
states,
but
the
regulation
was
present
and
the
motive
of
the
inventorying
officer
in
that
case,
which
is
absent
in
this
case,
was
he
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
vehicle
contained
a
weapon,
which
would
be
dangerous
either
to
himself
or
to
members
of
the
general
public.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
no
motive
or
no
reasonable
grounds
or
probable
cause
existing
to
believe
that
this
vehicle
contained
anything.
other
than
the
items
of
plain
view
that
were
contained
in
the
interior
that
the
officer
could
observe
from
the
window.
when
he
entered
to
the
glove
compartment,
this
officer
did
not
know
what
are
the
glove-compartment
contained
any
items
of
value.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
do
not
believe
you
would
have
to.
i
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
only
applicable
area
of
the
search
with
an
attempt
to
see
its
criminal
evidence.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
i
agree
with
your
position.
the
element
should
be
reasonableness
and
that
i
think
that
if
i
did
state
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
it
was
error
on
my
behalf
and
proceedings
that
analyzes
as
reasonable
measure.
but
i
think,
reasonableness
in
this
case,
the
automobile
was
seized
and
searched
right
around
noon.
it
was
a
broad
day.
this
is
a
very
small
rural
community.
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
the
standing
population
is
5,000,
and
when
the
university
is
in
session,
the
population
will
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
10,000.
but
it
is
a
small
community,
the
owner
did
arrive
at
the
police
station
sometime
around
3
p.m.
mr.
janklow’s
fax
stated
he
did
return
at
5.
he
did
return
at
3
p.m.
to
claim
his
automobile.
the
automobile
was
only
in
place
custody
for
period
of
three
hours
in
broad
daylight
in
the
small
rural
community.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
pardon?
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
there
is
a
possibility
that
it
is
happening,
but
i
think
in
those
particular
cases,
a
search
or
entry
into
the
automobile
maybe
justified
under
some
time
element
reasoning
which
exist
in
cooper.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
that
would
be
my
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
that
would
be
my
position
that
that
evidence
would
not
be
admissible,
the
entry
into
a
closed
part
of
the
vehicle
without
any
justification
or
without
any
basis
of
reasonableness
would
offend
fourth
amendment
standards.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
it
would
definitely
alter
situation;
it
would
give
the
officer
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
it
would
give
a
reasonable
foundation
for
the
officer
to
believe
that
the
vehicle
did
contain
something
which
should
be
removed
immediately
and
he
would
be
justified.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
in
my
view,
that
would
constitute
reasonableness
in
light
of
fourth
amendment
standards.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
my
answer
to
that
question
would
be
yes.
whoever
under
facts
of
this
case,
i
do
not
feel
that
they
did
stumble
under
this
evidence
by
accident;
i
think,
it
was
by
design.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
from
the
mere
fact
that
the
entry
was
gained
into
an
area
of
privacy
would
--
no
foundation
of
reasonableness.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
well,
the
state
seems
to
make
that
argument.
the
state
seems
to
make
the
argument
that
harris
is
applicable-.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
this
case
is
completely
different
than
harris.
harris
may
--language
in
harris
maybe
helpful,
but,
the
rule
of
law
spotted
by
harris,
in
my
opinion,
is
not
applicable
in
this
case,
and
i
do
assure
your
opinion
that
harris
is
a
plain
view
case.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
would
like
to
answer
that
question,
and
mr.
janklow’s
position
was
that
opperman
did
concede
the
initial
entry
onto
this
automobile.
that
has
never
been
my
position.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota,
the
initial
entry,
to
remove
articles
in
plain
view
as
reasonable.
my
argument
was
even
the
initial
entry
with
this
automobile
and
where
windows
are
rolled
and
the
doors
were
locked,
the
owner
had
taken
all
precautions
that
he
could
to
protect
his
items
of
value
within
the
car
finds
of
his
automobile.
the
initial
entry
or
breaking
the
clause
and
entering
into
the
automobile
was
unreasonable.
that
was
my
initial
argument.
however,
this
decision
now,
the
decision
that
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
has
modified
that
wise
decisions
stating
that
there
--
that
will
be
opinion
that
any
seizure
of
items
in
plain
view
would
be
unreasonable.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
think
perhaps
the
better
argument
between
the
initial
entry
and
the
alternative
argument
of
no
entry
what
at
all,
that
will
make
the
better
argument
is
that
that
would
justify
an
entry
into
the
automobile.
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
area
of
plain
view
within
the
automobile,
which
is
an
area
--
excurse
me
--which
is
an
area
in
order
to
come
within
the
automobile
exception.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
excuse
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
yes.
we
are
all
--
pursuant
to
the
states
additional
argument,
their
argument
also
runs
the
lower
court’s
decisions,
citing
state,
federal
court
decision.
about
half
of
the
state
court
decisions
that
the
government
relies
on
and
in
this
case,
did
not
analyze
an
inventory
procedure
to
be
a
search.
now,
the
state
has
conceded
this
to
be
a
search
for
purpose
of
this
argument.
now
the
additional
half
of
these
cases
proceed
with
the
analysis
of
reason
ones
in
the
light
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
argument
as
to
civil
liability
or
the
argument
of
bailments,
in
my
opinion,
is
applicable
in
the
analysis
of
reasonableness,
maybe
not
just
for
the
fact
that
it
is
fair
but
any
analysis
of
reasonableness
has
to
deal
with
motive.
what
is
the
motive,
in
my
opinion,
of
the
officer
that
is
entering
in
the
closed
compliance
of
the
automobile?
the
state
attempts
to
justify
this
entry;
it
means
of
the
officer’s
motive
was
to
protect
the
police
department.
well,
in
the
analysis
of
this
motive,
it
is
obvious
that
under
the
state
laws
for
each
he
was
operating
that
he
would
not
be
a
liable
for
the
entry
to
the
automobile,
for
it
would
not
reliable
to
any
articles
within
the
automobile
but
where
in
the
absents
of
his
plain
view.
the
only
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
this
was
announced
incidentally
in
this
case.
there
has
been
an
additional
decision
since
that
time
which
i
do
not
have
to
cite
to,
i
would
be
happy
to
send
it
to
you,
where
the
arrest
occurred
on
the
open
highway
and
the
automobile
was
left
by
the
police
officer
on
the
open
highway.
the
individual
who
was
arrested
was
taken
into
the
station
house
and
during
the
time
the
station
house
procedure
was
occurring
the
automobiles
was
vandalized.
our
supreme
court’s
stated
that
the
officer
was
under
no
liability
for
any
vandalism
that
occurred
to
the
automobile
on
the
open
highway.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
this
is
a
matter
of
statute
also.
certainly,
there
are
maybe
some
questions
as
the
statutory
interpretation,
but
i
think
the
statute
in
this
case
is
quite
clear.
in
south
dakota,
they
are
known
or
termed
as,
gratuitous
depositories,
and
they
are
only
held
to
a
slight
standard
or
slight
degree
of
care.
so,
i
think
that
the
--
there
maybe
a
problem
with
statutory
interpretation,
but
i
can
find
no
slighter
degree
of
care
that
rolling
the
windows
locking
the
doors
on
an
automobile
would
protect
any
property,
and
in
this
case,
automobile
was
already
lie.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
no,
i
do
not
believe
it
should
but
it
if
may
go
to
an
analysis
of
motive,
what
the
officer’s
motive
was
when
he
entered
the
automobile.
but
in
this
case,
the
state
is
attempting
that
justify
the
entry
as
a
police
protection
argument.
that
was
the
motive
that
the
officer,
one
of
the
motives
of
the
officer
entering
to
the
vehicle
to
protect
police
department,
and
i
do
not
see
how
that
motive
can
be
justified
in
light
them
the
state
statute,
only
defying
them
as
gratuitous
depositories
and
slight
degree
of
care.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
excuse
me
mr.
justice?
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
give
me
a
contrary
motive.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
that
would
be
correct.
now,
it
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
it
would
be
deterring
constitutional
violations
because
in
my
argument,
and
entry
under
the
closed
confines
of
the
automobile
and
the
console
would
be
a
breach
of
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes.
returning
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
marshall
as
to
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
any
bad
faith
or
any
bad
motive.
i
think
an
analysis
of
the
court
of
special
appeals
of
maryland
on
this
issue
in
their
latest
case
involving
inventories
procedure
is
helpful.
the
name
of
the
case
is
dixon
versus
state
where
the
justice
writing
that
opinion
begins
with
the
statement
that
nothing
is
affected
the
yawning
credibility
gap
in
between
the
officer’s
testimony
in
the
area
of
inventory
searches
since
the
dombrowski
cases.
and
i
think,
this
is
one
of
the
dangers
that
are
present
by
allowing
this
type
of
procedure
and
in
allowing
the
officer
to
testify
that
he
had
no
bad
motive,
and
that
it
was
strictly
a
good
effort.
i
do
not
think
the
constitutional
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
answer
to
that
particular
question
as
to
regard
to
the
state
policy.
i
think
that
the
holding
in
this
case
by
the
state
supreme
court
would
certainly
organize
or
stabilize
these
procedures.
it
would
certainly
give
direction,
this
holding,
and
i
think
since
holding
has
been
expounded
in
south
dakota
that
standard
has
been
reached
on
the
inventory
searches
after
this
holding.
so,
as
the
conclusion
of
this
argument,
my
position
is,
and
i
feel
to
be
a
better
position,
in
the
absence
of
any
reasonableness
the
entry
into
an
area
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
has
to
be
the
found
unreasonable
and
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
in
the
state’s
arguments
as
to
police
protection
and
the
argument
has
to
the
protection
of
the
owner
of
the
property,
in
my
opinion,
are
without
merit.
the
owner
is
given
no
more
protection
by
having
his
inventory,
the
items
in
his
automobile
inventory.
if
an
individual
is
going
to
make
false
claim,
he
is
going
to
be
the
type
of
visuals
going
to
make
it
at
anyway
whether
the
items
are
inventoried
or
whether
they
are
not
inventoried.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
i
would
say
that
just
because
an
inventory
sheet
is
presented
by
a
police
officer
that
it
does
not
--
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
those
materials,
yes,
those
materials
would
be
safe.
mr.
robert
c.
ulrich
yes,
that
would
be
protection.
well,
concluding
the
argument,
i
can
still
find
no
reason
why
an
entry
into
an
area,
protected
under
the
fourth
amendment
constitution,
the
standard
of
reasonableness,
i
can
find
no
reasonableness
as
to
the
entry,
and
this
closed
compliance.
in
the
absence
of
any
reasonableness,
the
evidence
should
be
excluded
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
thank
you.
