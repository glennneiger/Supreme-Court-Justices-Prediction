mr.
janklow,
does
the
record
show,
what
the
police
standard
procedure
is
with
respect
to
ascertaining
the
ownership
of
the
vehicle
and
where
the
owner
might
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
a
sign,
for
example
and
whether
there
was
a
license
on
the
car
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
this;
i
just
wanted
you
to
confirm
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
practice,
mr.
janklow,
do
they
take
it
out
of
the
car
then,
these
items
or
do
they
leave
them
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
also
does
the
records
tell
us
what
the
standard
procedure
would
have
been
if
there
had
not
been
a
valuable
article
such
as
a
watch
in
plain
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
rely
particularly
on
the
fact
that
they
saw
the
watch
in
the
back
seat
or
whatever
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
were
unlocked?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
show
one
of
the
standard
procedures
were
adopted
by
the
police
department?
it
does
show
some
vandalizing;
i
am
just
wondering
the
vandalizing
was
before
or
after
the
standard
procedures?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
ulrich
you
keep
referring
to
the
desirability
giving
him
a
choice,
if
he
had
been
present.
but
is
it
not
the
typical
situation,
one
in
which
the
owner
is
not
present?
that
is
why
the
problem
arises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
assuming
he
is
not
present,
what
exactly
is
the
obligation
of
the
police
and
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
before
they
may
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
car,
including
the
glove
compartment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
that
they
are
unable
by
looking
at
the
license
plate
or
seeing
any
other
indicia
of
ownership
in
plain
view.
assume
they
are
unable
to
identify
the
owner,
would
you
say
that
then
it
would
be
reasonable
or
unreasonable
to
make
a
complete
search
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
they
get
an
abandoned
car
and
they
cannot
identify
the
owner,
you
would
say
that
police
may
never
go
into
the
private
areas
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
it
was
apparent
that
the
vehicle
had
been
stolen,
and
then
abandoned
on
the
street?
would
you
stay
still
it
cannot
be
searched?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
basically
you
are
saying,
i
think
that
no
search,
if
you
know
the
owner,
without
first
notifying
the
owner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
an
affirmative
duty
to
contact
the
owner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ulrich,
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
police
officers
are
possibly
sometimes
guilty
of
not
telling
the
truth.
i
suppose
there
are
also
on
occasions
guilty
of
breaking
into
cars
and
stealing
the
property
of
the
citizen
who
abandoned
it
there.
is
it
a
possible
legitimate
interest
to
the
state
to
regularize
the
procedure
by
which
this
inventories
are
taken,
in
order
to
minimize
the
danger
of
theft
by
the
police
officers?
