mr.
janklow
you
drawn
the
distinction,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
inventory
and
the
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
is
ounce,
is
that
enough
for
one
cigarette?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
duties
the
policeman
have
been
looking
up,
he
left
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
place
where
did
do
anymore
and
check
to
see
if
it
is
a
stolen
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
called
up
all
the
cars
that
were
seized
in
new
york,
you
will
be
busy
all
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
should
not
have
left
it
on
the
street?
justice
thurgood
marshall
illegally.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
policeâ€™s
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
very
well
be
an
abandoned
car?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
trying
to
find
where
you
get
that
they
should
have
notified
him
or
gone
to
look
for
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
insist
that
that
is
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
you
do
that
before
they
tow
the
car
away?
how
far
you
are
going
to
go
on
that?
why
--
if
they
have
got
that
much
doing
to
notify
you
after
they
tow
it,
why
do
they
have
to
notify
it
before
the
tow
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
it
is
not
a
duty,
what
is
it?
it
is
just
would
be
nice
if
they
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
discuss
the
constitutional
statutory
rights
here.
we
are
not
talking
how
nice
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
locked,
it
was
unlocked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
compartment
was
unlocked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
is
just
(inaudible)
i
mean,
why
are
we
arguing
on
the
theories
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
you
keep
emphasizing
that
they
had
some
kind
of
a
duty
to
notify
him
that
they
had
towed
his
car
away.
the
normal
procedures,
when
your
car
is
gone,
you
call
the
police
and
the
police
say,
did
you
pay
your
last
installment?
and,
you
say
yes.
and,
he
says
we
are
going
to
look
and
see
if
we
towed
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
usual
procedure
in
vermillion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
usual
procedure
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
was
they
were
doing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
is
there
in
the
record
to
give
you
a
motive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
is
there
in
the
record
to
give
you
a
contrary
motive
on
behalf
of
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
are
inventoried
and
carried
to
this
police
and
put
into
police
safe,
they
are
a
little
bit
safer
than
not
there
in
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
a
sheet
--
they
took
the
materials
and
took
them
through
the
police
and
put
them
in
safe
keeping.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
not
protect
for
the
man?
