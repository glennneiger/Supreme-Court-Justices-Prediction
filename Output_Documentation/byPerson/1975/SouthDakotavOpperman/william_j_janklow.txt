mr.
william
j.
janklow
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
versus
opperman
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
dakota,
and
basically
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
an
inventory
procedure
of
an
automobile
that
was
taken
pursuant
to
lawful
ordinance
of
the
city
of
vermillion,
south
dakota.
i
think
the
facts
are
particularly
important
with
respect
to
this
particular
case,
they
are
very
brief.
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
december
12,
i
should
say
december
10,
1973,
there
was
a
car
parked
on
the
street
in
vermillion,
south
dakota
which
is
a
small
college
town,
the
seat
of
the
university
of
south
dakota.
the
ordinances
in
the
city
of
vermillion
prohibit
parking
there
from
2
am
to
6
am
in
the
morning.
this
vehicle
was
parked
there
during
that
period
of
time
received
the
ticket
from
the
police
officer
the
next
morning.
it
was
still
there
at
approximately
10
a.m.
the
meter
maid
in
making
her
rounds,
put
a
ticket
on
the
car,
shortly
there
after
when
she
completed
the
rounds,
she
reported
it
to
the
police
department
at
which
time
the
one
of
the
police
officers,
officer
frank,
went
over
looked
at
the
car,
and
examined
the
two
tickets,
and
had
the
car
towed
away
to
the
impoundment
lot
in
vermillion.
the
impoundment
lot
in
vermillion
is
an
unguarded
lot
and
as
the
record
clearly
establishes,
they
have
had
trouble
there
previously
with
respect
to
having
cars
broken
into
and
vandalized
when
they
have
been
put
in
the
impound
lot.
as
you
look
through
the
window
of
the
automobile,
the
windows
were
locked,
i
should
say
rolled
up,
and
the
doors
were
locked.
as
he
proceeded
in
to
look
into
automobile,
he
could
see
a
wrist
watch
and
other
items
on
the
back
seat.
he
had
the
tow
truck
operator
to
open
the
truck,
open
the
door
latch
i
should
say,
and
he
proceeded
pursuant
to
the
standard
procedure
of
the
vermillion
police
department
with
a
standard
procedural
form
to
go
through
and
inventory
the
contents
of
the
automobile
for
valuables.
the
standard
inventory
consisted
of
things
such
as
the
outside,
the
exterior
condition
of
the
car,
the
dashboard,
the
seats,
the
floors,
and
things
to
that
nature.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
in
our
brief,
we
attempted
to
draw
the
distinction
between
an
inventory
and
search,
and
frankly
we
no
longer
do
that.
i
do
not
draw
a
distinction.
i
do
draw
as
distinction
in
the
word
search
between
criminal
searching
type
conduct
and
normal
inventorying
type
thing.
but
i
will
get
in
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
but,
we
do
not
attempt
at
this
point
before
the
court
to
say
that
an
inventory
is
an
intrusion
which
is
the
fourth
amendment
type
of
search
situation.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
does
not
your
honor,
and
i
am
--
since
our
office
did
not
handle
it
i
do
not
know.
i
only
know
what
the
record
shows
and
the
record
that
does
not
show
that.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
as
far
i
can
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
does
not,
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
after
this
--
they
have
had
several
instances
where
cars
had
been
vandalized.
the
vermillion
police
department
is
a
small
police
department
in
a
college
town,
the
impoundment
lot
is
not
secure
or
guarded
at
anytime
and
they
have
had
past
instances
of
people
breaking
in
the
cars.
so,
as
a
result
of
that
particular
procedure,
they
have
started
inventorying
cars
for
the
valuable
contents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
our
particular
case,
the
respondent
opperman
has
never
contested
at
any
point
in
this
proceedings
including
in
the
briefing
stages
before
the
supreme
court
that
the
police
officer
did
not
have
followed
a
proper
procedure
and
was
doing
nothing
wrong
in
violation
of
any
amendment
including
the
fourth
amendment
when
he
entered
the
car,
the
locked
car
to
search
for
the,
i
should
not
say
the
search,
to
secure,
retrieve
and
put
into
safety
the
contents,
the
watch
and
things
of
that
nature.
there
is
never
been
any
argument
that
the
police
officer
have
done
anything
that
was
not
in
fact
correct.
so,
basically,
what
we
come
down
to
is
during
the
point
of
the
time
that
the
officer
was
retrieving
the
items
from
inside
the
body
of
the
car,
he
checked
the
glove
compartment.
he
opened
the
glove
box,
it
was
close
but
it
was
not
locked
and
open
it
up
in
it
he
found
a
checkbook
and
installment
loan
contract
or
installment
loan
papers,
blank
checks,
some
keys
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
less
than
an
ounce
of
marijuana.
all
of
these
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no
sir,
they
were
taken
out
of
the
car
and
they
were
in
this
case,
all
of
these
items
to
the
vermillion
police
department
pursuant
--
after
they
filled
out
an
inventory
sheet
and
approximately
5
a.m.,
or
i
should
say
5
p.m.
of
the
same
afternoon,
mr.
opperman,
respondent
opperman
came
to
the
vermillion
police
department,
picked
up
his
belongings
and
his
valuables,
received
them
back
with
the
exception
of
the
marijuana
where
warrant
was
served
at
him.
citation
was
issued,
and
that
brought
about
the
reason
for
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
to
my
understanding
mr.
justice
stevens
that
all
of
the
cars
that
are
impounded
by
the
vermillion
police
department
involved
having
the
contents
inventoried
for
the
protection
of
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
do
not.
the
reason
for
that
again
is
--
i
think
we
are
involved
basically
with
three
particular
issues
when
we
are
talking
about
safety
of
property.
the
first
issue
is
the
safety
of
the
individual
who
owns
the
car’s
property.
opperman
obviously
left
his
watch
on
the
dash
and
argument
then
i
think
could
be
made
that
by
leaving
his
wrist
watch
on
the
dash,
he
could
careless
whether
or
not
somebody
took
his
watch.
but,
he
left
it
out
on
the
main
street
of
vermillion,
south
dakota
where
it
is
well
left
and
it
was
moved
to
a
different
place
pursuant
to
legitimate
or
lawful
police
activity
under
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
vermillion
police
department.
the
trunk
was
not
searched
in
this
particular
automobile.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
does
not.
i
have
to
ask
the
counsel
if
it
does
not.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
even
if
it
is
locked,
it
does
not
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
if
it
were
unlocked?
i
cannot
answer
that
because
i
do
not
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no.
a
package
of
cigarette’s
weighs
approximately
an
ounce
and
the
standard
i
always
get
is
you
can
you
probably
get
about
20
joints
from
an
ounce.
it
is
standard
that
i
usually
here.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
they
are
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
frankly
do
not
see
any
difference.
i
think
if
i
had
to
put
them
in
orders
or
priority
one,
glove
boxes
have
locks
them.
when
anybody
ever
breaks
into
a
car,
i
can
imagine
anybody
breaking
into
a
car
to
take
anything
and
not
going
into
the
glove
box,
because
i
think
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
we
realize
that
people
always
go
into
there.
and
because
opperman
concedes
that
we
could
be
in
the
car
under
plain
view
to
secure
the
watch,
it
was
just
a
matter
of
checking
the
glove
box
and
it
opened
up
and
out
came
the
contents.
i
think,
also
frankly
that
with
respect
to
a
trunk
and
under
the
hood,
there
are
certain
areas
to
this
country,
frankly
in
our
states,
some
areas
more
than
other
where
things
like
car
batteries
disappear
quite
often.
i
am
not
familiar
that
engines
come
out
of
cars
very
often
when
they
are
vandalized,
but
certainly
car
batteries
do
the
same
as
true
with
respect
to
items
in
the
trunks:
spare
tires
and
jacks,
and
things
to
that
nature
invariably
come
out
of
trunks.
the
state
of
south
dakota
is
not
contending
that
everything
that
is
there
has
the
right
to
be
going
through.
for
example,
we
are
not
arguing
for
a
moment
that
we
could
go
inside
the
wrist
watch
to
look
for
things.
respondent’s
pre
phrases
questions
about
the
suitcases
and
things
of
that
nature
and
cites
the
lawson
cases.
the
lawson
case
i
should
say
from
the
eight
circuit,
but
we
have
got
a
different
situation
there,
because
in
the
lawson
case
you
are
dealing
with
a
trunk
that
was
entered.
we
did
not
have
any
trunk
that
was
entered,
we
feel
that
the
scope
of
the
search
or
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
or
whatever
characterization
the
activity
should
be
given,
whatever
terminology
it
should
be
given,
is
one
enough
activity
to
one,
secure
the
item
and
two,
to
be
able
to
reasonably
identify
it
for
the
purposes
of
safe
keeping
and
inventory.
and
if
that
is
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no
sir.
i
would
not
because
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
our
record
that
would
indicate
that.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
case
in
vermillion
that
is
arisen
with
respect
to
the
discovery
of
anything
for
a
crime.
we
have
got
--
i
am
familiar
with
the
amicus
briefs
that
was
file
from
americans
reflective
law
enforcement,
i
believe
it
is
the
name
of
the
organization
and
they
cite
statistics
dealing
with
other
areas
of
the
country
which
show
that
in
fact,
a
very
small
portion
of
the
automobiles
in
those
sample
areas
that
are
inventory
involve
the
recovery
of
any
properties
that
deals
with
criminal
activity,
and
frankly,
it
would
be
the
most
unproductive,
assuming
that
the
statistics
that
had
been
submitted
are
true,
it
would
be
the
most
unprotected
fight
for
police
activity
that
you
can
imagine
and
it
would
certainly
be
wasteful,
and
that
there
are
better
things
that
police
could
do
with
respect
to
protection
of
the
people
and
the
property
and
the
community.
and,
so
for
those
reasons,
we
do
not
feel
that
that
is
the
secondary
motive
at
all
mr.
justice
powell.
we
think
that
one
of
the
key
things
that
we
have
here
is
that
we
certainly
are
not
in
the
particular
situations
like
some
of
the
more
large
states
are
or
the
more
popular
states
are.
you
take
states
such
as
new
york,
illinois,
michigan
and
places
like
that
that
have
the
larger
police
departments,
that
have
the
facilities,
impoundment
lots
with
high
wire
fences
around
them,
guards
around
them
and
things
to
that
nature.
and,
you
know,
i
do
not
know
that
we
would
be
here
if
were
representing
one
of
those
states
and
face
with
that
problem.
but
we
are
dealing
with
vermillion,
south
dakota
where
frankly
we
just
do
not
have
the
resources.
i
think
it
is
more
than
just
the
protection
of
the
individual’s
property
that
we
are
talking
about
when
we
talked
about
this
inventorying
procedure,
because
we
have
also
got
the
protection
of
the
law
enforcement
officers.
now
our
supreme
court
attempted
to
minimize
that
particular
problem
by
stating
that
because
the
individual
had
left
his
car
and
had
lawfully
come
in
to
the
custody
of
the
law
enforcement
community
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
ordinance
provided
that
it
would
be
impounded,
that
it
be
taken
away
for
the
improper
parking,
that
the
law
enforcement
community
then
at
that
point
became
a
gratuitous
bailee
and
as
a
result
there
liability,
if
any,
was
very
slight.
but,
i
do
not
think
frankly
that
fourth
amendment
is
ever,
an
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
ever
turned
on
what
the
financial
obligations
are
or
responsibilities
are
of
any
of
the
particular
varieties
involved
in
the
proceeding,
and
the
one
additional
thing
which
was
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
except
--
we
work
from
the
premise
basically
that
all
people
are
honest.
we
pre
suppose
that
they
are
going
to
honest,
and
that
one,
if
the
first
individual
that
has
the
interior
contact
or
the
contact
with
the
automobile
inventory,
it
is
a
question
of
that
one
person’s
word
against
anybody
else’s
one;
and
two,
you
have
got
the
situation
where
once
the
community
knows
that
impounded
automobiles
are
inventoried,
it
is
certainly
going
to
not
make
a
lot
of
sense
once
the
words
out
for
them
to
go
vandalizing
and
breaking
in
the
cars
any
longer
that
have
no
valuables,
and
then
because
they
have
been
taken
out.
so,
i
think
that
there
is
a
third
category
here,
a
protection
and
that
is
protection
of
people
from
not
being
encouraged,
especially
young
people,
juveniles,
to
go
and
burglarizing
and
vandalizing
cars
when
they
realize
there
will
not
be
any
fruits
there.
and
so,
i
think
we
are
not
only
talking
about
protection
of
the
law
enforcement
community,
we
are
also
talking
about
protection
of
the
individual
who
has
got
possession
or
originally
had
possessions
of
the
vehicle
or
at
least
whose
property
is
in
the
vehicle,
as
well
as
the
general
public.
so,
i
think
there
are
three
areas
of
protection
that
we
are
dealing
with,
with
respect
to
this
particular
case.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
it
does
not
show
that
your
honor.
we
feel
that
with
respect
to
the
court’s
decision,
in
cady
versus
dombrowski
that
basically
although
it
did
not
come
down
on
exactly
the
same
issue.
it
was
awful
close
that
the
language
of
that
is
could
be
controlling
or
could
be
governing.
the
parallels
that
could
be
drawn
from
a
real
community
in
wisconsin
with
vermillion,
south
dakota
are
certainly
there.
with
respect
to
the
activity
of
the
law
enforcement
officers,
the
parallel
was
there
other
than
a
fact
that
in
dombrowski,
they
were
dealing
with
looking
for
a
firearm
for
generally
the
protection
of
the
general
public
at
large.
we
are
dealing
with
an
automobile
in
both
instances
that
lawfully
came
into
the
control
of
the
law
enforcement
community
and
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
things
is
there
has
never
been
an
allegation
at
any
time
in
our
case,
as
the
same
is
true
in
dombrowski
that
the
law
enforcement
officers
were
looking
for
one
any
criminal
evidence
that
they
were
conducting
any
criminal
investigation,
that
they
were
involved
in
anyway,
in
pursuing
the
criminal
law.
no
allegations
ever
been
made
that
there
was
any
attempt
to
subterfuge,
or
i
should
say
that
there
was
a
subterfuge
being
used
in
this
inventory
process
to
pursue
the
criminal
law
or
any
criminal
prosecution.
as
a
matte
of
fact,
the
records
clear
at
least
as
far
as
the
trial
transcript
is
concern.
i
believe
the
page
number
is
27,
when
a
law
enforcement
officer
was
asked,
he
said
that
until
he
was
in
1the
process
of
doing
this
inventory
and
came
across
the
items
in
the
glove
compartment,
he
had
no
reason
to
suspect
anything
improper
with
respect
to
that
particular
motor
vehicle.
i
think
the
key
or
in
a
lot
of
cases
in
this
area,
especially
in
the
supreme
court
level,
the
supreme
court’s
cases
of
cooper,
harris
and
dombrowski
are
basically
the
three
key
cases.
dealing
with
the
cooper
case,
first
i
should
say,
then
the
harris
case
and
then
of
most
recent
nature,
the
case
in
dombrowski
in
1973.
preston
case
was
discussed
a
lot
in
all
of
these
various
cases.
but
the
preston
case,
we
submit,
is
not
involved
in
our
issue
here,
the
1964
preston
decision
for
the
reason
that
preston
dealt
with
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
say
that
a
car
was
taken
pursuant
to
a
valid
arrest,
even
though
--
or
the
search
i
should
say
was
conducted
pursuant
to
a
valid
arrest,
when
in
fact
that
was
no
the
case.
individuals
were
arrested
for
vagrancy
there
and
the
issues,
the
holding
in
preston
has
been,
on
many
occasions,
referred
back
to
is
the
fact
that
it
is
confined
specifically
to
the
facts
that
you
have
in
preston
and
that
we
do
not
have
here
with
this
particular
case
at
all.
law
enforcement
officers
were
not
in
any
legal
custody
of
the
preston
vehicle
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
attempted
in
subsequent
argument
or
i
should
in
further
argument
to
say
that,
the
car
might
had
been
stolen
and
that
is
the
reason
they
were
looking
at
it
from
that
standpoint.
so,
we
feel
that
the
preston
case
is
not
controlling.
there
is
an
additional
case
other
than
those
that
have
been
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
fourth
circuit,
i
have
been
informed,
has
recently
come
down
with
a
decision,
dealing
with
this
particular
type
of
fourth
amendment
question.
i
frankly,
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
case.
i
was
only
made
aware
of
it
yesterday
and
i
do
not
have
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
certainly
will.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
additional
time
that
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
couple
of
things
mr.
chief
justice.
members
of
the
court,
with
respect
to
the
defendant’s,
excuse
me,
respondent’s
contemption,
that
you
can
compare
this
case
with
cady,
that
opperman
case
with
cady,
the
state
will
submit
that
is
the
case
also.
cady
was
unconscious;
here
opperman
was
even
not
around.
he
might
as
well
a
bit
unconscious
because
he
was
not
around,
from
the
time
in
the
early
morning
hours
when
he
first
discover
that
his
car
was
not
available
or
that
he
did
not
--
his
car
would
not
start,
according
to
the
record
until
late
the
next
day
afternoon,
he
never
bother
to
call
the
police
department
which
everybody
can
see
in
a
community
with
approximately
5,000
to
10,000
people.
yet,
an
argument
is
not
made
that
there
was
some
expectation
the
police
should
go
around
and
around
looking
for
him.
when
the
obvious
thing
would
have
been,
and
had
he
cared,
was
to
get
a
hold
of
the
police
department.
second
of
all,
cady,
there
was
a
nuisance
the
car
park;
here
there
was
a
nuisance
with
car
park.
there
is
a
legitimate
ordinance
that
there
is
no
argument
but
there
is
a
legitimate
ordinance
that
provides
that
cars
that
break
the
law
with
respect
to
the
parking
have
to
be
removed
between
2
and
6
a.m.
with
respect
to
the
impoundment
in
cady
the
car
was
impounded
and
here
the
car
was
impounded.
in
cady
it
happened
to
be
seven
miles
from
the
police
station,
on
the
rural
country
of
wisconsin,
here
we
happened
of
had
it
taken
inside
the
community
of
vermillion,
but
also
not
at
the
police
station,
and
also
on
a
public
place
where
it
was
unprotected.
in
cady,
they
talked
about
motive
and
here
we
talked
about
motive.
in
cady,
the
motive
was
to
search
for
the
weapon
to
protect
the
general
public.
there
was
no
argument
but
what
the
police
and
cady
where
doing
was
to
look
for
the
weapon
one,
and
two
their
contact
with
the
car
was
a
non-criminal
contact
because
the
car
was
a
nuisance
and
they
legitimately
had
it.
here
in
opperman,
we
have
non-criminal
contact.
there
was
no
suspicion
and
nobody
has
ever
made
the
allegation
that
there
was
any
police
suspicion
of
any
criminal
violation.
we
have
got
the
protection
of
the
public,
the
protection
of
the
police
officer,
and
the
protection
of
mr.
opperman
with
respect
to
the
property
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
would
say
yes,
because
i
think
anybody
frankly
--
people
put
their
keys
under
the
floor
mat
a
lot
of
times.
people,
that
is
where
they
place
the
ignition
key.
in
our
country,
you
look
in
the
ashtray
over
the
visor
and
under
the
floor
mat
when
you
are
looking
for
keys.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
not
under
the
floor
mat
in
the
back
seat.
but
if
you
are
going
to
do
the
proper
inventory
procedure,
i
will
submit
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
no,
you
do
not
parked
the
keys
there
but
--
mr.
william
j.
janklow
we
think
that
that
would
be
proper
just
because
trunks
are
broken
into
just
like
glove
boxes
are
broken
into.
this
particular
case
we
have
here
mr.
justice
white,
respondent
concedes
where
in
the
car
and
he
would
have
us
just
stop
and
look
at
the
glove
box
and
not
even
check
to
see
what
is
open.
but,
we
would
submit
that
the
legitimate
areas
of
concern
for
the
protection,
on
the
balancing
test
under
what
is
reasonable,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
reasonable
substandard,
the
objective
standard
of
terry
versus
ohio,
that
was
set
forth
by
the
court
in
terry
versus
ohio
would
certainly
be
the
one
that
will
be
applicable
in
could
be
applicable
with
respect
to
these
inventory
procedures
are
that
the
interior
of
the
car,
the
body
of
the
car
i
should
say,
under
the
hood
and
the
trunk.
that
does
not
mean
you
tare
off
the
door
panels,
it
does
not
mean
you
tare
the
seats
apart,
does
not
mean
you
go
up
under
the
behind
the
dash,
and
those
kind
of
things.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
looking
under
the
seat,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
janklow
i
would
say
the
answer
to
that
would
be
yes.
just
because
of
thief
that
would
go
in
there
would
break
up
that
glove
box,
but
i
would
also
submit
that
if
that
was
our
fax,
i
would
be
in
a
completely
different
situation.
i
think
would
be
less
tenuous,
or
i
should
say
more
tenuous
than
it
is.
now,
but
we
submit
that
reasonableness
is
in
fact
the
standard
under
the
fourth
amendment,
clearly
the
fourth
amendment
demands
reasonableness
and
the
standard
of
terry
versus
ohio
on
the
objective
test,
that
is
the
one
that
would
be
appropriate.
the
last
point
that
the
state
would
suggest
is
what
had
when
he
found
the
wrist
watch
on
the
dash,
had
he
opened
the
glove
box
to
put
it
in
there?
to
get
it
out
on
plane
view
and
seeing
the
marijuana
with
the
respondent
present
then
arguing
that
for
some
reason,
the
law
enforcement
officer
had
also
made
a
mistake.
but
the
key
thing
i
think
the
facts
in
our
case
are
unique
and
they
lay
us
basically
other
than
for
the
gun
situation
that
put
a
squarely
within
the
reasoning
and
the
logic
and
the
proposition
that
where
laid
forth
with
respect
to
dombrowski.
also
the
arguments
for
fourth
in
cooper
and
harris
clearly
apply,
that
the
automobile
is
of
a
different
nature
than
somebody’s
house.
it
is
mobile
but
not
only
it
not
mobile
but
also
because
of
the
police
contact
in
an
non-criminal
nature,
that
there
is
so
much
of—this
is
the
only
reasonable
thing
that
these
officers
could
have
done
other
than
to
just
leave
the
car
in
an
area
where
they
knew
that
it
is
broken
into
on
the
past
and
where
it
could
be
broken
into
now,
and
then
face
the
arguments.
this
whole
argument
about
bailments
and
gratuitous
bailee
frankly,
although
there
is
a
statute
down
in
the
south
dakota,
it
does
not
pertain
the
police
officer,
it
is
a
statute
on
gratuitous
bailments
and
it
took
our
supreme
court
to
decide
that
issue
and
even
its
respondents
says
in
this
argument,
even
after
this
case,
there
is
another
case
before
our
supreme
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
law
enforcement
officer
was
agreed
to
it
as
bailee
and
we
submit
that
the
protection
of
people’s
property
should
not
depend
on
whether
or
not
people
are
gratuitous
bailees
or
not.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
would
request
the
decision
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
be
reversed.
thank
you.
