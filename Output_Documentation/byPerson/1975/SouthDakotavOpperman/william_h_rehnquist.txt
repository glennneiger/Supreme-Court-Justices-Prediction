rehnquist
mr.
janklow,
i
suppose
regardless
of
the
standard
imposed
by
south
dakota
as
to
what
kind
of
bailee,
you
can
still
get
into
arguments
about
whether
something
was
or
was
not,
in
fact,
in
the
glove
compartment.
if
someone
comes
along
later
and
says
it
was
stolen.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
can
keep
it
in
your
wallet
then.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ulrich
does
not
the
notion
of
probable
cause
almost
not
land
itself
when
you
depart
from
the
idea
of
a
search
with
the
object
of
taking
incriminating
evidence?
i
mean,
does
it
make
any
sense
in
cady
versus
dombrowski
to
talk
about
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
a
gun
in
the
trunk,
when
you
are
not
talking
at
all
in
terms
of
pursuit
of
criminal
evidence?
do
you
not
have
to
analyze
in
some
other
terms
of
reasonableness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
am
suggesting
is
that
perhaps
the
line
of
analysis
should
be
reasonableness
which
is
the
language
of
the
amendment
rather
than
probable
cause
when
you
get
out
the
side
of
the
area
you
have
searching
for
criminal
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ulrich,
what
if
you
win
here
and
the
south
dakota
legislature
decides
it
does
not
like
the
result
very
much,
and
so
if
passes
a
statute
saying
that
policeman
impounding
car
shall
be
subject
to
the
highest
degree
of
care.
ought
that
to
change
the
result
for
fourth
amendment
purposes?
