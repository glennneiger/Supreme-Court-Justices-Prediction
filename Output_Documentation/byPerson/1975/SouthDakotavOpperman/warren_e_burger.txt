chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
south
dakota
against
opperman.
mr.
janklow,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
in
this
case
the
constitutional
issues
are
no
different
sort
of
from
what
they
would
be
if
it
were
heroin
or
some
other
stuff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
as
you
get
that,
send
as
a
memorandum
and
send
it
to
your
friend.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
janklow.
mr.
ulrich.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
that
the
car
with
a
pennsylvania
license
tagged
on
it.
you
would
not
think
to
have
an
obligation
to
pick
the
phone
and
call
pennsylvania
and
see
who
owns
that
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
going
back
to
the
situation
as
here,
an
apparently
abandoned
car
or
at
least
the
car
left
alone
overtime
and
do
you
say
that
they
had
no
power
to
search
the
car
for
whatever
records
or
papers
might
indicate
the
identity
of
the
owner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
doing
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
calling
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
they
find
the
ticket
of
the
card,
the
ownership
card
or
the
driverâ€™s
license
in
the
car,
you
said
they
have
no
right
to
take
that
easier
step?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
does
not
mean
that
there
would
be
no
expectation;
it
is
not
required
in
many
places
but
in
many
places
that
is
where
you
would
find
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
justice
white
suggested
that
is
where
you
would
find
it
in
his
car,
that
where
you
would
find
in
my
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
have
been
there
for
three
days
of
three
weeks?
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
have
been
there
for
three
days
or
three
weeks?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
another
one
hypothetical
question.
now,
they
did
not
enter
the
trunk
in
this
case,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
they
did
enter
the
trunk
and
found
inside
the
trunk
some
incriminating
evidence,
you
say
that
would
similarly
be
subject
to
suppression
and
exclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
when
they
open
the
trunk,
they
found
small
child,
bound
in
the
gagged,
victim
of
kidnapping.
that
fact
would
not
be
admissible
an
evidence
if
he
is
tried
for
kidnapping.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
this
hypothetical
kidnapped
victim
were
10-12
years
old
and
vigorous
enough
to
kick
on
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
make
a
little
noise.
do
you
think
that
then
might
alter
the
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
it
alter,
because
it
gave
some
probable
cause
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
they
have
the
right
to
go
in,
in
your
view,
then
to
see
whether
it
was
just
a
hunting
dog
or
kidnapped?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
he
they
just
stumbled
down
and
by
accidents,
then
they
could
not
prove
or
use
that
evidence
against
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
record
do
you
suggest
supports
all
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
that
in
a
decision
on
precisely
that
point
or
did
they
just
announce
it
incidentally
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
officer
or
municipality
might
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court
as
this
case
now
demonstrates
to
get
that
decided.
do
you
not
think
they
have
the
right
to
talk
some
precautions
and
how
the
procedures
that
will
protect
them
even
against
the
likelihood
of
defending
a
suit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
thing
that
will
be
deterred,
the
only
conduct
that
will
be
deterred
if
the
case
were
decided
your
way,
would
be
inventorying
contents
of
cars.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
be
deterring
constitutional
violations,
but
simply
here
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
