the
exigent

there
is

it
can

improperly
up?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
number
75-19,
united
states
against
santana
involves
a
search
and
seizure
question
that
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
august
of
1974,
an
undercover
police
officer
arranged
to
purchase
heroin
from
one
mccafferty.
he
drove
with
mccafferty
to
a
place
called
2311
north
fifth
street
in
philadelphia
where
mccafferty
took
a
$110
in
marked
bills
and
went
inside,
indicating
that
she
was
going
to
get
the
dope
from
one
known
as
mom
santana.
mccafferty
soon
returned
to
the
car
and
they
drove
off.
mccafferty
turned
over
several
glassine
envelopes
containing
a
brownish-white
powder
which
was
later
found
to
be
heroin.
at
this
point,
about
a
block-and-a-half
from
the
santana
house,
the
officer
stopped
the
car
and
arrested
mccafferty,
he
asked
her
where
the
money
was.
she
said,
“mom
has
the
money.”
this
information
was
passed
on
to
other
officers
who
proceeded
to
the
north
fifth
street
address.
they
saw
respondent
santana,
known
to
them
as
mom
santana,
standing
in
the
doorway
of
her
house.
when
they
pulled
up
and
identified
themselves,
she
attempted
to
flee
into
the
house.
she
was
apprehended
in
the
westerville
and
found
to
have
both
heroin
and
some
marked
money
in
her
possession.
the
district
court
granted
respondent
mom
santana's
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
though
it
found
that
there
were
strong
probable
cause
to
arrest
santana
and
that
the
police
acted
under
extreme
emergency
conditions.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion.
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
in
united
states
against
watson,
decided
earlier
this
term.
we
held
that
the
warrantless
arrest
of
an
individual
in
a
public
place
did
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
since
santana
by
standing
in
her
doorway
was
not
in
the
area
where
she
had
any
expectation
of
privacy,
we
hold
that
she
was
in
public
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
consequently
a
warrantless
arrest
was
proper
under
watson.
her
act
of
retreating
into
the
house
may
not
thwart
an
otherwise
valid
arrest,
rather
the
police
are
entitled
to
follow
her
inside
under
the
hot
pursuit
doctrine
of
warden
against
hayden.
since
the
arrest
was
valid,
the
property
ceased
pursuant
to
that
arrest
should
not
have
been
suppressed.
the
chief
justice
and
justices
stewart,
white,
blackmun,
powell
and
stevens
joined
this
opinion,
but
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
joins.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joins.
