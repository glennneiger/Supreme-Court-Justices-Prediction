justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
judge
said
that
before
you
move
the
van
you
should
have
gone
and
gotten
the
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
did
santana
know
that
she
had
been
caught?
she
did
not
know
it,
did
she?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
think
there
was
no
danger
when
destroying
this
loot?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
publicly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
people
that
go
in
and
make
purchases
do
not
usually
do
not
usually
do
it
public,
do
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
us
put
it
this
way,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
did
not
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
she
did
know
i
would
submit
that
she
would
have
come
out
the
back
door
rather
than
the
front
door?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
you
submit
the
whole
case
is,
do
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
