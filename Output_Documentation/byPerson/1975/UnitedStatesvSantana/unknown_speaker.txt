excuse
me
mr.
easterbrook,
i
am
little
confused,
i
am
glancing
now
at
the
district
judgeâ€™s
oral
colloquy
which
amounted
to
his
opinion,
i
guess,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
except
it
is
to
be
on
her
person,
or
in
plain
view
they
would
be
required
to
get
a
warrant,
would
they
not?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
oh,
no?
unknown
speaker
but
your
own
knowledge
what
shows
--
the
record
shows
that
she
had
just
engaged
in
a
sale
of
narcotic?
unknown
speaker
--
if
there
was
probable
cause?
