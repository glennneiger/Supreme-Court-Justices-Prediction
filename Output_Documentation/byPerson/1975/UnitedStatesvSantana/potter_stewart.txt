to
mccafferty
--
justice

not

that
would
have
been
that
evidence
that
santana

heroin
in
her
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
or
sell
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
it,

is
--

heroin
that
was
sold
to
mccafferty?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
reason
to
suppress
that,

it?
justice

stewart
so
you
can
tell
by
that
quantity

how
faraway
were
they,
when
they
learned
of
the
sale
to

to
be
supported
by
probable
cause?
