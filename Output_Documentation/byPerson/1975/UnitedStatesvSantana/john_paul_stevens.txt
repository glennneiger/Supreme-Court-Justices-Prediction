let
me
state
that
second
ground,
you
say
when
it
is
supposed
evidence
might
be
destroyed,
is
that
not
always
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
dependent
upon
there
being
some
likelihood
that
--
well,
supposing
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
crime
involves
no
other
evidence
other
than
just
knowledge
or
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
person
say,
committed
a
murder,
but
there
is
no
evidence,
you
do
not
expect
to
find,
does
the
evidence
have
any
bearing
and
i
understand
â€“-
i
am
quite
following
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
just
one.
on
both
of
your
second
and
you
third
justifications,
probable
cause
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
by
the
particular
suspect,
also
a
probable
cause
that
he
is
within
the
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
are
required?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
i
have
just
one
small
point.
is
it
correct
that
your
theory
is
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
she
was
then
committing
the
crime
of
possession
of
heroin
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
as
opposed
to
having
just
completed
a
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
that
they
would
--
they
had
before
they
went
up
after
the
door?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
easterbrook,
may
i
ask
about
the
ongoing
crime
theory.
you
told
me
a
little
earlier
that
the
reason
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
she
was
then
committing
a
crime
was
that
you
assume
that
one
who
sells
some
heroin
retains
some
in
supply.
do
you
also
assume
that
the
retained
heroin
is
on
the
person
of
the
defendant
or
merely
on
the
premises?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
only
appropriate,
but
necessary?
