mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
in
reality
whether
200
years
after
the
declaration
of
independence,
americans
can
be
secured
in
the
knowledge
that
the
police
may
not
broach
the
sanctity
of
their
homes,
seize
them
or
there
loved
ones,
carry
them
away
without
a
judicial
finding
of
probable
cause
for
their
arrest,
accepting
the
argument
that
in
certain
cases,
exigent
circumstances
would
require
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
what?
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
well,
what
the
record
shows
in
the
district
court,
and
why
the
district
court
i
believe
held
this
way
was
that
the
police
set
in
motion
the
fact
of
the
discovery
of
the
arrest
by
their
own
action
and
immediately
going
to
the
house
and
taking
the
options
of
her
immediately
rushing
up
--
in
plain
clothes
with
guns
drawn
and
rushing
the
house.
when
the
court
felt
below
that
it
would
have
been
just
as
easy
and
more
constitutionally
proper
for
them
to
have
gone
immediately
to
the
place
where,
in
philadelphia,
where
the
justices
of
the
peace
sit
on
a
24
hour
basis
which
is
only
a
half
an
hour
away,
gotten
a
warrant
and
return
and
not
rush
the
house
with
guns
drawn
and
children
sitting
on
a
steps
in
plain
clothes
in
this
fashion.
so
i
think
the
argument
that
once
the
police
ran
up
to
the
house
with
their
guns
drawn
that
the
defendant
would
have
known
that
they
were
coming
to
arrest
them
would
have
destroyed
evidence,
begs
the
issue
that
the
district
court
found
was
that
they
should
not
have
acted
in
that
fashion.
they
said
they
had
the
time.
were
no
exigent
circumstances
absent
what
the
police
themselves
created
here
in
this
case.
the
exigent
circumstances,
as
pointed
out
by
the
government
in
this
case,
are
all
circumstances
which
were
created
by
the
government’s
action
and
could
have
been
negated
by
merely
getting
a
warrant
and
returning
to
the
house
and
making
the
arrest.
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
i
think
that
--
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
i
think
if
she
were
out
in
the
street
or
if
it
was
an
open
porch,
not
connected
inside
the
close
of
the
house
as
we
might
say,
it
might
--
the
case
might
fall
into
the
area
of
the
watson
decision.
but
in
this
case
the
record
clearly
shows
that
she
was
inside
the
doorway,
and
a
matter
fact,
one
of
the
police
officers
testified
even
in
the
vestibule.
and
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
this
case
is
here
today
is
to
decide
the
issue
different
from
watson,
not
a
person
out
in
a
public
place,
but
whether
a
person
inside
the
home,
has
the
security
that
we
submit
the
fourth
amendment
gives
additional
rise
to
the
security
of
the
home.
in
this
case,
there
were
absolutely,
according
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
no
exigent
circumstances.
there
was
no
information
whatsoever
that
the
defendant
was
armed
or
dangerous.
there
was
no
degree
of
time
necessary
to
get
a
warrant,
as
in
the
miller
case,
another
third
circuit
case
where
they
knew
that
it
only
took
15
minutes
to
cut
heroin.
it
would
have
taken
them
45
minutes
to
get
the
warrant.
here
the
district
court
found
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
they
have
ample
time
to
get
a
warrant.
thirdly,
there
was
no
information
that
the
defendant
was
in
anyway
aware
that
the
police
was
on
--
were
--
was
on
her
trail.
and
finally,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever,
and
the
record
as
it
is
stood
when
the
police
rushed
the
house
that
there
would
be
an
effort
to
dispose
off
the
money,
which
is
the
only
real
evidence
that
the
police
were
talking
about.
in
this
case,
that
they
were
going
in
to
seize.
the
court
below
asked
a
specific
question,
on
page
37
of
the
record.
now,
the
minute
you
left,
what
was
your
purpose
of
going
to
the
house?
what
did
you
intend
to
do?
answer
-
i
immediately
intended
to
recover
the
marked
money
that
was
used
in
the
transaction
and
arrest
of
defendant
dominguez
santana.
nothing
in
the
record,
in
this
case,
that
they
had
a
reason
to
believe
that
there
are
additional
narcotics
present
in
the
house
or
that
this
defendant
in
fact
possess
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
interestingly
reveals,
no
direct
information
that
it
was
this
defendant
who
made
the
sale,
the
evidence
presented
in
this
case
was
that
the
police
officer
saw
mccafferty
go
into
the
house
with
alejandro
and
come
out
of
the
house
shortly
after.
the
police
had
never
seen
mrs.
santana
at
all
that
day.
and
when
asked
about
the
transaction
the
only
thing
that
mccafferty
said
was
mom
has
the
money,
not
that
mom
sold
the
dope,
but
that
mom
had
the
money.
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
well,
she
was
seen
going
into
the
house
with
the
co-defendant,
mr.
alejandro
and
coming
out
a
short
time
after
and
i
think
it
would
be
just
as
logical
to
assume
that
the
dope
could
have
been
sold
by
alejandro,
and
somehow
she
saw
the
proceeds
eventually
go
to
mrs.
santana
was
told
that
the
money
would
eventually
go
to
her.
but
in
this
record,
and
i
am
not
arguing
with
the
finding
of
the
district
court
of
a
probable
cause
here.
what
i
am
saying
is
the
record
here
is
even
a
little
unclear
as
to
what
knowledge
the
police
had
when
they
charged
the
house
with
their
guns
drawn,
in
plain
clothes
with
children
sitting
on
the
step
saying,
police.
here
in
addition
to
the
issues
raised
by
the
government
on
their
appeal
--
there
was
the
another
issue
that
i
do
not
think
the
court
really
felt
it
necessary
to
get
to,
but
that
was
that
the
circumstances
of
this
arrest,
the
failure
to
say,
we
are
here
to
arrest
you,
and
merely
running
up
with
guns
drawn
into
somebody’s
home
without
stating
the
purpose
for
that
entry,
was
in
fact
improper
also.
the
sanctity
of
a
person’s
home
is
not
only,
i
believe,
guaranteed
by
the
constitution,
but
it
is
a
tradition
that
goes
back
hundreds
of
years
in
england
and/or
anglo-saxon
heritage.
it
is
a
problem
not
only
that
existed
at
the
time
of
our
revolution
and,
according
to
many
writers,
was
one
of
the
fundamental
reasons
why
in
1776
there
was
a
declaration
of
independence,
but
in
fact,
exist
today
outside
of
our
country
in
england,
the
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
i
do
not
intend
to
dwell
on
at
any
great
length.
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
in
england?
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
in
england
there
was
no
requirement
for
a
warrant
to
make
an
arrest
and
i
submit
that
is
the
reason
why
our
constitution
was
written
or
fourth
amendment
was
written
to
the
constitution
was
to
distinguish
between
what
was
going
on
in
england
and
the
colonies
in
those
days,
and
what
was
hoped
for
to
be
different
in
this
country.
because
in
england
today,
according
to
at
least
the
press
in
london,
that
is
before
the
house
of
parliament,
a
bill
that
gives
the
internal
or
inland
revenues
service,
as
it
is
called
in
england,
the
right
to
go
into
somebody’s
home
and
search
for
any
papers
necessary
to
prove
tax
evasion,
take
away
anything
necessary,
and
break
doors,
if
necessary.
general
warrants
--
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
with
a
warrant,
but
not
no
warrants
specifying
to
any
general
specific
areas
that
--
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
no.
it
is
a
warrant
that
is
obtained
from
a
justice
of
the
peace,
which
according
to
the
reports
i
have
read,
has
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
what
the
inland
revenue
service
might
be
interested
in,
but
the
point
i
am
making
is
this
is
a
general
warrant,
the
type
of
warrant
that
was
used
in
england
and
in
the
colonies
before
the
declaration
of
independence,
which
lead
to
the
eventual
finding
that
a
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
was
necessary.
if
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
us
from
intrusions
into
our
home,
and
protect
us
from
the
police
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
arrest
us
by
putting
between
the
police
and
the
citizen
a
judicial
disinterested
determination,
then
what
does
the
fourth
amendment
stand
for?
it
has
to
stand
for
the
fact
that
in
america,
citizens
before
they
could
be
taken
out
of
their
house,
whether
be
day
or
night
--
and
i
do
not
think
--
although
it
is
a
little
more
horrendous
to
be
dragged
from
your
home
without
a
warrant
at
night
than
it
is
to
be
dragged
from
your
home
or
have
your
sons
or
daughters
dragged
from
your
home
in
the
day
time
without
a
warrant.
at
least
if
we
know
that
before
the
police
came
to
our
house,
absent
exigent
circumstances,
that
a
judge
had
found
probable
cause,
then
i
believe
we
will
be
finding
what
our
forefathers
in
the
bill
of
rights
wanted
to
offer
for
our
country
that
we
would
be
different
from
the
systems
in
other
countries,
and
that
we
would
have
the
protections
of
a
judicial
determination
of
probable
course.
in
this
case,
there
was
absolutely
no
exigent
circumstances
found
by
the
trial
court,
and
no
reason
to
go
into
the
home
and
drag
out
mrs.
santana
in
the
fashion
it
was
done.
this
was
a
row
house
with
people
sitting,
children
sitting
on
the
step
and
the
facts
are
that
plain
clothes
policemen
jumped
out
of
a
van,
ran
up
with
guns
drawn,
ran
into
the
house,
and
grabbed
the
defendant.
it
is
a
frightening
aspect
or
specter
to
think
of,
even
though
when
we
consider
that
the
crime
involved
is
a
crime
that
we
consider
serious.
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
frightening
that
it
might
happen
to
one
of
us
that
the
police
may
come
to
our
house,
run
up
with
guns
drawn
and
plain
clothes,
run
through
the
doorway
where
we
are
standing
on
vestibule
and
grab
us.
it
is
frightening
that
to
think
that
not
only
can
this
happen
to
someone
as
alleged
like
mom
santana,
but
it
could
happen
to
anyone,
where
the
police
are
the
ones
making
the
determination.
mr.
dennis
h.
eisman
well,
i
--
i
concur
that
where
the
person
is
armed
and
dangerous.
where
there
is
evidence
that
the
person
can
destroy
the
evidence,
or
might
destroy
the
evidence,
or
might
flee,
that
that
is
a
common
sense
and
logical
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
but
here
in
this
case,
and
i
believe,
and
the
reason
why
this
case
is
before
this
court
today
is
the
determination
of
absent
those
exigent
circumstances.
do
we
as
american
citizens
have
the
protection
of
a
judicial
determination
before
we
are
seized?
normally,
before
this
time
most
of
the
cases
requiring
warrants
were
just
for
the
seizure
of
property,
and
i
am
the
first
to
admit
that
property
rights
are
extremely
important
in
our
society,
but
rights
to
physical
arrest,
i
believe,
are
a
little
more
important,
and
the
seizure
of
a
person
is
it
goes
even
deeper
than
the
seizure
of
a
property,
and
people
should
at
least
be
have
the
same
rights
to
protection
of
a
judicial
determination
before
the
seizure
of
their
person
that
they
have
in
the
seizure
of
their
property.
thank
you.
