mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
police
can
make
a
warrantless
arrest
of
a
person
who,
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe,
has
committed
one
crime
only
moments
before
and
is
still
committing
another
crime,
when
that
arrest
requires
a
brief
entry
into
the
vestibule
of
a
house.
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
this
question
is
that
a
warrant
need
not
be
obtained.
three
independent
arguments
support
our
position.
two
of
these
arguments
assume,
arguendo,
that
a
warrant
ordinarily
must
be
obtained
to
make
an
arrest
inside
a
house.
we
argue
first
that
a
warrant
need
not
be
obtained
when
a
crime
is
in
progress
and
the
entry
can
halt
that
crime.
second,
we
argue
that
a
warrant
need
not
be
obtained
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
when
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
is
in
progress.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
unless
it
was
known
beforehand,
if
it
just
simply
turned
out
that
it
was
in
progress,
the
after
the
fact
justification
would
not
be
sufficient.
second
argument
is
that
an
entry
should
be
permissible
when
it
occurs
within
a
few
hours
after
a
crime
and
during
a
time
during
which
it
might
be
supposed
evidence
might
be
disposed
off.
we
submit
that
the
case
can
be
decided
upon
either
of
those
two
grounds
without
reaching
the
general
issue
of
when
a
warrant
must
be
obtained
to
enter
a
house
to
make
an
arrest.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
our
general
argument
in
that
regard
is
that
during
several
hours
after
a
crime,
it
should
be
reasonable
to
enter
a
house
to
make
an
arrest.
and
that
the
general
justification
for
that
is
that
evidence
might
be
destroyed
during
those
first
few
critical
hours.
whether
or
not
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
be
destroyed
in
a
particular
case
as
we
submit
immaterial
that
the
justification
of
reasonableness
extends
to
those
cases
as
a
class
and
it
is
not
dependent
upon
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
it
would
be
difficult
to
understand.
there
is
often
evidence
that
a
murder
has
been
committed
and
that
evidence
might
dissipate.
in
the
case
of
cupp
against
murphy
of
course
there
were
fingernail
scrapings
under
the
fingernails,
type
of
evidence
that
might
dissipate.
but
our
justification
runs
to
crimes
as
a
whole
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
are
often
used
evidence
of
crimes.
the
problem
with
figuring
out
whether
there
is
evidence
in
a
particular
case
is,
we
submit,
the
best
argument
against
requiring
the
officers
to
figure
out
whether
there
is
or
is
not?
it
is
such
a
problematic
inquiry
and
it
depends
so
much
upon
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
require
officers
or
indeed
to
require
courts
to
make
that
kind
of
determination
before
or
after
the
fact
in
a
particular
case.
the
third
argument
is
that
it
is
always
reasonable
to
enter
a
home
to
make
an
arrest
with
or
without
a
warrant.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
historically,
that
has
been
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
our
position
is
that
that
still
should
be
so,
but
it
is
of
course
not
necessary
to
reach
that
question
here
because
of
the
two
independent
grounds
that
i
have
begun
to
set
out
and
also
because
this
arrest
took
place
during
the
day.
our
primary
support
for
that
is
historicalness,
mr.
justice
holmes
wrote,
“page
of
history
is
worth
a
volume
of
logic.”
but
i
do
not
intend
to
discuss
that
point
further
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
about
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
both
are
required.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
complicated.
a
philadelphia
narcotics
squad
officer
arranged
to
purchase
heroin
from
patricia
mccafferty.
patricia
mccafferty
told
him
that
she
would
go
down
to
mom
santana’s
for
the
dope.
the
officer
recorded
the
serial
numbers
of
$110
in
$10
and
$20
bills
and
gave
the
bills
to
mccafferty.
mccafferty
visited
santana’s
house,
spent
a
few
moments
inside,
and
returned
to
the
officers’
car
with
heroin,
but
without
the
money.
the
officer
gave
a
hand
signal
to
other
officers,
and
mccafferty
told
him
that
mom
santana
has
the
money.
the
other
officers
then
drove
in
there
van,
the
short
distance
to
santana’s
house,
intending
to
arrest
her
for
her
part
in
the
crime
and
to
recover
the
purchase
money.
when
the
group
of
officers
drove
up
in
there
van
in
front
of
santana’s
house,
they
saw
her
standing
in
the
threshold
of
her
doorway
with
a
brown
paper
bag
in
her
hand.
one
of
the
officers
recognized
the
person
in
the
doorway
as
santana.
the
officers
left
the
van
and
ran
up
to
the
walkway
to
the
front
door
of
the
house.
there
were
approximately
15
feet
between
the
curb
and
the
doorway
of
the
house,
so
it
took
about
a
moment
to
reach
the
threshold.
meanwhile,
santana
had
turned
and
retreated
into
the
interior
of
her
residence.
one
of
the
officers
overtook
her
in
the
vestibule,
as
she
was
leaving
the
vestibule
for
the
living
room
of
the
house.
respondent
alejandro
was
in
the
living
room.
when
the
officers
overtook
santana
they
jostled
her,
and
white
packets,
white
packets
filled
with
white
powder,
fell
out
the
bag
to
the
ground
in
the
vestibule.
santana
ran
from
the
living
room,
attempted
to
pick
up
the
packets
and
attempted
to
flee.
another
officer
subdued
alejandro
and
the
arrest
was
completed
in
the
vestibule.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
they
were
officers
of
the
philadelphia
police.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
our
view,
they
must
be
judged
as
though
they
were
federal
officers,
and
because
of
elkins
and
i
would
add
to
elkins,
the
companion
case,
rios,
364
u.s.
260
to
61
and
most
recently,
cady
against
dombrowski,
413
u.
s.
433
at
449.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
must
be
treated
as
though
they
were
federal
officers
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
their
actions
comported
with
the
federal
constitution.
the
packets
in
the
bag
were
heroin.
santana
was
asked
to
empty
her
pockets.
the
officers
recovered
from
the
search
of
santana’s
pockets,
$70
of
the
purchase
money.
the
other
$40
of
purchase
money
was
never
found.
the
officers
also
discovered
on
a
table
in
the
living
room
two
large
knives
that
could
have
been
used
as
weapons.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
by
the
fact
--
because
the
serial
numbers
have
been
recorded
your
honor.
the
serial
numbers
on
the
other
money
in
santana’s
pocket
did
not
tally
with
the
money
that
had
been
used
for
the
purchase.
respondents
were
indicted
for
possessing
heroin
with
intent
to
distribute
it.
they
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
seized
incident
to
their
arrest
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
were
originally
also
arrested
by
state
authorities,
initially
-–
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
they
were
charged
by
state
authorities.
approximately
a
week
after
the
arrest
the
state
charges
were
dismissed
so
that
there
is
no
state
prosecution
now
pending.
they
were
dismissed
technically
without
prejudice,
but
the
state
authorities,
i
am
informed,
have
to
intention
of
prosecuting.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
was
not.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
although
the
oral
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
not
entirely
clear,
the
judge
apparently
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
required
to
be
suppressed,
because
the
arrest
of
santana
was
made
without
a
warrant.
court
recognized
that
there
was,
in
his
words,
strong
probable
cause
to
arrest
santana
and,
in
our
words,
absolute
certainty
to
believe
that
she
was
at
home.
moreover,
the
judge
stated
that
he
did
not
want
to
criticize
the
officers
for
acting
as
they
did
under
the
extreme
emergency
posture
of
a
case
like
this.
nevertheless,
the
judge
concluded
they
should
have
obtained
a
warrant
to
enter
her
vestibule
to
make
the
arrest.
we
appealed,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion.
we
begin
from
the
premise
that
under
united
states
against
watson
decided
by
this
court
on
january
26
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
district
court
concluded
that
because
they
found
$70
in
respondent
santana’s
pockets,
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
evidence
was
to
be
destroyed.
in
our
view
this
is
essentially
a
post
hoc
justification.
the
officers
had
no
way
of
knowing,
whether
they
would
find
the
evidence
or
not
amongst
santana’s
pocket.
and
the
fact
that
they
did
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
the
fact
that
they
did
find
that
there
was
happenstance
and
was
something
they
could
not
have
known
at
the
time
they
were
making
the
arrest.
under
united
state
against
watson,
we
believe,
police
are
entitled
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant,
if
they
are,
where
they
have
a
right
to
be,
at
the
time
they
make
the
arrest.
in
watson,
the
police
had
a
right
to
be
in
the
public
restaurant
at
noon
time
and
therefore
had
a
right
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
there
is
no
doubt
that
police,
like
other
visitors
have
the
right
to
approach
a
house
by
using
the
front
steps.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
was
the
heroin
that
was
found
in
the
bag
that
respondent
santana
was
carrying
at
the
time
she
was
seen
in
the
doorway.
and
that
is
the
very
heroin
that
she
is
charged
with
the
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
that
is
the
focus
of
the
indictment
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--
was
not
suppressed
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
would
also
have
been
evidence.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
but
that
evidence
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
she
was
charged
with
possession
of
the
heroin
that
was
found
in
the
bag.
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
the
indictment
is
a
page
5
of
the
separately
bound
appendix.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
and
the
heroin
that
was
the
subject
matter
that
indictment,
was
the
heroin
that
was
in
the
bag
at
the
time
she
was
arrested.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
does
not
appear
specifically
in
the
indictment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
there
was
no
reason
to
suppress
that
and
it
was
not
suppressed.
the
subject
matter
of
the
indictment
relates
that
she
possessed
587
grains
of
heroin.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
mccafferty
was
indicted
with
distributing
42
grains
of
heroin.
that
is
in
the
paragraph
immediately
preceding.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
was
part
of
his
reason
for
suppressing
the
evidence,
and
i
booked
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
is
no
other
statement
except
to
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
none
other
your
honor,
except
the
fact
that
it
was
in
her
pockets
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
which
was
approximately
two
or
three
minutes
after
the
sale,
and
at
that
point,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
$40
of
the
money
was
already
gone,
$70
was
recovered.
problem
here
we
think
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
did
on
the
last
page
of
his
oral
opinion
on
page
5a,
the
second
paragraph
from
the
end.
the
court
believes
the
heroin
would
support
count
two
and
three
should
be
suppressed
and
not
offered
as
evidence.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
correct.
he
never
makes
any
statement
that
there
was
–
that
the
officers
knew,
or
did
not
know
whether
that
was
to
be
destroyed.
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
his
opinion
that
the
officers
did
not
know
that
it
was
soon
to
be
destroyed.
we
think
the
problem
here
is
whether
the
police
who
were
entitled
to
approach
santana
as
she
stood
in
her
doorway,
were
required
to
stop,
turn
back
and
seek
a
warrant
because
santana
retreated
from
the
threshold
of
her
doorway
into
her
vestibule.
the
consequences
of
a
sudden
stop
would
have
been
considerable.
respondents
would
have
been
afforded
a
respite
of
an
hour
or
more
while
the
warrant
was
being
obtained.
there
would
have
been
ample
time
then
to
destroy
the
heroin
and
the
money
which
having
seen
the
officers
coming.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that
is
another
possible
interpretation,
and
my
understanding
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
--
at
least,
one
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
expressed
that
view.
and
if
that
is
the
correct
view
of
this
case,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
because
the
officers
were
entitled
to
approach
santana
as
she
stood
in
her
doorway
without
a
warrant,
and
the
respondents
do
not
seriously
contest
that.
but
if
it
is
the
correct
view
of
the
case
the
arguments
that
we
make
here
are
unaffected.
it
was
still
true
that
the
police
believed
that
she
was
committing
the
crime
of
possession
of
heroin,
and
it
was
still
true
that
the
arrest
was
quite
prompt
after
she
had
committed
the
crime
of
distributing
heroin
to
mccafferty.
and
i
will
now
turn
to
our
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
her
for
two
crimes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
that
it
is
reasonable
for
officers
to
believe
that
people
who
have
just
sold
heroin
from
a
house
in
an
operation
of
this
sort
have
not
sold
at
all.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
essentially
a
question
of
common
experience.
the
most
general
justification
for
the
arrest
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
continuing
crime
was
articulated
by
mr.
justice
marshall
in
watson.
he
wrote,
“when
law
enforcement
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
is
taking
place
in
their
presence
and
that
the
suspect
is
at
that
moment
in
possession
of
the
evidence,
exigent
circumstances
exist.
delay
could
cause
escape
of
the
suspect
or
destruction
of
the
evidence.”
that
fits
this
case
exactly.
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
santana
was
engaged
in
the
crime
of
possession
of
heroin
with
intent
to
distribute
it,
and
that
she
possessed
not
only
the
heroin
but
the
evidence
of
another
crime,
her
previous
sale
of
heroin
to
mccafferty.
they
were
therefore
entitled
to
make
a
prompt
arrest
even
though
that
involved
an
entry
into
her
vestibule.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
they
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
her
for
that
crime.
there
would
be
some
difficulties
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
that
they
could
make
the
arrest.
there
would
in
our
view
be
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
entered
in
the
vestibule.
there
would
be
difficulties
if
they
then
attempted
to
search
the
house
for
the
heroin
that
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
was
there.
we
believe
they
would,
at
that
point,
be
required
to
desist
and
if
the
heroin
was
not
within
the
reach
of
her
or
on
her
person
to
obtain
a
warrant
to
search
the
house
for
the
heroin
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
was
there.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
to
search
the
house
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
unless
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
were
other
people
in
the
house,
for
example
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
assuming
that
they
had
already
arrested
everyone
in
the
house.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
would
like
to
expand
upon
my
answers
to
two
of
mr.
justice
stewart’s
questions.
you
inquired,
mr.
justice
stewart
about
the
nature
the
indictment
in
this
case,
and
the
indictment
is
indeed,
as
i
indicated,
for
the
possession
of
the
heroin
that
was
in
the
bag.
united
states
attorney
informed
me
that
that
indictment
was
returned,
because
patricia
mccafferty
whose
testimony
would
have
been
perhaps
necessary
for
proof
of
the
sale
to
mccafferty
had
indicated
that
she
was
unwilling
to
testify
against
santana.
and
therefore
the
decision
was
made
to
indict
her
for
the
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
the
heroin
of
the
bag.
second
question
had
to
do
with
whether
our
position
was
that
you
could
make
a
warrantless
arrest
entry
at
night?
and
i
indicated
that
that
our
position
was
that.
i
should
expand
by
saying
that
we
believe
that
historically
no
warrant
has
been
required
and
none
should
be
required,
but
the
reasonableness
of
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
full
force,
and
it
could
--
and
usually
would
be
unreasonable
to
make
a
night
time
entry
if
a
daytime
entry
would
do
as
well
to
make
an
arrest.
so
that
we
do
not
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
night
time
entries
are
a
preferable
or
indeed
unquestioned
way
of
making
such
arrests,
they
are
not.
they
are
often
unreasonable.
this
case
does
not
involve
an
entry
to
search
for
a
suspect
who
may
or
may
not
be
there.
does
not
involve
a
delayed
arrest
for
a
crime
committed
long
ago.
the
officers
had
seen
santana
in
the
doorway
with
their
own
eyes
and
they
knew
she
had
committed
a
crime
there
moments
before
and
probably
was
still
committing
a
crime.
there
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
about
a
block
and
a
half
your
honor.
and
they
returned
that
block
and
a
half
in
a
very
brief
time.
this
immediate
arrest
did
not
only
put
a
halt
to
an
ongoing
crime
but
it
preserved
the
evidence
of
that
crime
and
of
the
crime
that
had
just
been
committed
in
the
sale
to
mccafferty.
it
prevented
any
possibility
of
flight,
it
produced
maximum
surprise,
and
by
that
token,
maximum
safety
to
the
officers,
because
if
the
officers
had
been
compelled
to
desist
and
defect
the
house
arrest,
their
personal
safety
could
have
been
in
some
danger,
if
they
had
later
attempted
to
make
the
arrest
once
respondents
knew
they
were
there
and
attempting
to
arrest
them.
in
many
ways,
this
case
is
similar
to
scher
against
united
states,
which
we
discussed
in
our
reply
brief.
officers
had
possessed
probable
cause
to
believe
that
scher
was
committing
the
crime
of
distributing
distilled
spirits
and
that
he
had
some
such
spirits
in
his
car.
they
followed
scher’s
car
to
his
home
and
arrested
him
in
his
garage.
the
court
unanimously
upheld
that
arrest.
it
observed
that
the
passage
of
the
car
into
the
garage
did
not
destroy
the
officers’
right
to
follow
and
to
arrest
mr.
scher,
and
so
it
is
here.
respondent’s
passage
into
her
vestibule
did
not
destroy
the
officers’
right
to
arrest
her
for
an
ongoing
crime.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
assume
only
that
is
on
the
premises
your
honor,
and
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
chief
justice,
it
would
be
permissible
to
arrest
that
person.
at
that
point,
if
a
search
of
the
premises
were
necessary
to
discover
the
heroin,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
obtain
a
warrant
to
make
the
search
of
the
premises
for
the
heroin.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
necessary,
yes.
we
do
not
argue
that
you
can
search
the
premises
if
the
heroin
is
not
on
the
person
who
is
arrested.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
the
search
would
go
no
further
than
the
permissible
scope
of
search
under
chimel
against
california,
which
included
the
person
of
the
person
arrested
and
the
area
within
his
reach
at
the
time
of
arrest.
we
do
not
believe,
however,
that
the
right
to
make
the
arrest
of
santana
depended
necessarily
upon
the
fact
that
she
was
committing
the
crime
of
possession
of
heroin
with
intent
to
distribute.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
reasonable
for
officers
to
enter
the
house
within
a
few
hours
after
a
crime
and
hear
the
crime
of
the
sale
to
mccafferty.
whether
or
not
this
justification
is
called
fresh
pursuit.
it
is
based
on
an
entirely
practical
understanding
that
the
first
few
hours
after
a
crime
are
critical,
both
to
capture
the
suspect
and
to
recover
the
evidence.
it
is
a
justification
based
on
exigencies
that
pertain
to
many
cases.
the
decisions
of
the
courts
below
by
requiring
officers
to
delay
and
invest
one
or
more
hours
in
obtaining
a
warrant,
would
disable
them
from
acting
during
this
most
critical
time
immediately
after
a
crime
had
been
committed.
once
these
first
few
hours
have
passed,
the
need
for
haste
is
diminished,
but
at
least
during
the
first
few
hours
it
is
reasonable
for
officers
to
act
promptly
to
make
the
arrest.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
this
argument,
because
it
said,
the
police
could
not
be
sure
that
respondents
would
flee,
could
not
be
sure
that
respondents
would
destroy
evidence
and
so
on.
the
problem
with
this
approach,
as
i
indicated
earlier
to
you
mr.
justice
stevens,
is
that
there
are
many
possible
outcomes
during
the
first
few
hours
after
a
crime.
they
are
in
reality
no
more
than
predictions
of
probabilistic
events.
the
police
may
know
that
some
suspects
will
flee;
they
will
know
that
some
will
arm
themselves
in
attempt
to
defend
themselves
against
arrest;
they
know
that
some
suspects
will
destroy
evidence,
but
with
rare
exceptions,
they
cannot
know
which
suspects
those
are.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
santana
did
not
know
until
her
arrest
was
made
and
our
argument
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
believe
that
there
was
a
very
real
danger
as
soon
as
the
arrest
of
mccafferty
was
made
only
a
few
blocks
away.
mccafferty
--
the
arrest
of
mccafferty
could
have
been
observed
and
that
in
fact
could
have
been
related
to
santana.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mccafferty
was
arrested
immediately
after
the
sale.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
she
was
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
she
was
arrested
in
an
automobile
approximately
a
block
and
a
half
from
santana’s
house.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
there
is
nothing.
and
our
argument
is
that
there
need
be
nothing.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right.
oh,
no.
there
is
no
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
are
not
arguing
that
she
knew.
we
are
arguing
that
the
prompt
arrest
prevented
her
from
running.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
are
not
arguing
your
honor
that
she
was
about
to
destroy
these
goods.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
our
argument
is
that
officers
might
reasonably
believe
that
some
suspects
will
destroy
evidence.
we
are
not
arguing,
this
was
necessarily
such
a
suspect.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
her
probable
reaction
we
think
is
to
attempt
to
destroy
the
evidence
that
she
has
and
to
attempt
to
flee,
if
they
were
required
to
desist
after
they
were
walking
up
her
driveway.
but
again,
as
we
have
argued
it
is
simply
the
question
of
probabilities,
and
we
think
it
was
reasonable
for
the
officers
in
consideration
of
these
probabilities
to
continue
on
to
make
the
arrest.
our
argument
rests
on
probabilities
and
it
rests
on
an
analysis
of
reasonableness
that
pertains
to
the
many
cases
other
than
this
one.
if
there
are
no
questions
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
counsel
for
respondent
has
indicated
that
a
problem
in
this
case
is
the
failure
of
the
officers
to
announce
that
they
were
officers
and
to
state
their
purpose
and
to
demand
entry.
i
will
deal
with
that
just
quite
briefly.
it
is
not
clear
that
the
constitution
requires
any
announcement.
ker
against
california
presented
that
question
directly,
and
four
justices
believe
that
it
did;
four
justices
that
it
did
not,
and
justice
harlan
expressed
no
view
on
that
question.
assuming
the
constitution
requires
some
sort
of
announcement.
the
pertinent
analogue
would
be
18
u.s.c.
3109,
which
requires
an
announcement
prior
to
the
breaking
of
the
door
of
a
house.
our
reply
brief
devotes
substantial
space
to
this
question.
we
have
argued
that
walking
in
through
an
open
door,
in
the
view
of
someone
who
knows
that
the
officers
are
coming,
is
not
such
a
breaking
that
an
announcement
is
required
by
section
3109.
and
in
addition,
there
was
no
chance
here
that
any
of
the
harms
that
that
rule
was
intended
to
prevent
could
come
about.
the
rule
was
designed
to
prevent
the
exertion
of
force
by
officers,
the
breaking
of
doors
when
that
kind
of
breaking
could
be
avoided
by
consent.
it
was
also
designed
to
avoid
unnecessary
opportunities
for
violence.
the
householder
in
england
had
the
right
to
protect
himself
against
those
who
would
break
down
his
door
and
enter.
and
the
rule
of
announcement,
by
letting
him
know
that
the
police
were
coming,
would
prevent
that
sort
of
violence,
but
this
case
does
not
present
either
of
those
two
rationales
and
we
submit
should
not
be
cover
by
them.
thank
you
very
much.
