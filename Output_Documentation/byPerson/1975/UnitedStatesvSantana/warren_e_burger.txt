or
when
it

in
progress
and
that
fact

chief

e.

just
to
be
abstract
without
observation
or
without
objective
fact
--
chief

say
recovered
the
money,

a
virtue
of
them

serial
numbers?
chief

e.
burger
did
district

following
the
words
that
the
court
--
what
the
district
judge
said
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
by
way
of
an
opinion,
and
among
other
things,
the
presence
of
the
money
in
defendants
santana’s
pocket
indicates
that
there
was
no
basis
to
conclude
that
it
was
to
be
destroyed,
that
is
the
judge’s
statement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
predicate
for

suppression?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

any
other
explanation

(inaudible)
the
district

observed,
or
did
he
at
some
point?
chief

warren
e.
burger
what
should
be
suppressed
that
to
--
that

warren
e.
burger
to
serve
a
status
quo
until
someone

chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
just
assuming.
chief

warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1
o’clock.
mr.
easterbrook
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
said
before
that
the
limit
of
the
officers
conduct,
once
they
got
in
the
house
was
a
-
to
search
that
person
who
was
arrested
and
b
-
to
seize
any
contraband
in
plain
view,
and
the
third
alternative
would
be
to
take
them
in
custody
and
preserved
the
status
quo
while
awaiting
another
officer
who
would
go
to
secure
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
--
again
walking
up
her
driveway
when
she
was
standing
in
the
open
door,
what
would
be
her
probable
reactions
since
your
dealing
in
probabilities?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
eisman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
suggest
as
a
hypothesis
for
the
probabilities
when
the
officers
approached
the
door
and
she
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway,
as
it
turns
out
with
the
heroin
either
in
her
hands
or
under
her
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
lady
had
been
on
the
front
porch
and
had
not
identified
the
police
as
policemen,
as
they
approached
to
assume
that
they
were
reps,
assuming
that
they
were
magazine
salesmen
or
whatnot,
could
they
have
lawfully
arrested
her
then
and
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
given
the
knowledge
that
they
had
about
the
prior
transaction
a
few
minutes
before?
chief
