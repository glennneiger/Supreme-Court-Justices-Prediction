where
do
we
get
any
authority
at
all
in
view
of
1447(d)
that
says
an
order
of
remanding
a
case
to
a
state
court
pursuant
to
that
was
removed
pursuant
to
section
1443
shall
not
be
reviewable
by
appeal
or
otherwise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
not
just
as
possible
to
say
that
what
1447(d)
contemplates
is
that
congress
rather
deliberately
chose
to
avoid
the
danger
of
delay
that
would
come
from
appealing
an
order
of
remand,
even
though
that
order
was
erroneous
rather
than
to
make
sure
that
an
erroneous
order
of
remand
was
straightened
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
every
time.

mr.
dickey
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
the
first
hundred
years
in
this
country
that
there
were
trials
in
the
federal
courts
for
criminal
offenses,
there
was
no
appeal
whatever
beyond
the
district
court
until
1889.
if
a
district
judge
or
circuit
judge
sitting
all
by
himself
sentenced
you
to
a
hundred
years
in
prison,
there
was
simply
no
appeal
from
that
and
nobody
ever
suggested
that
even
though
it
was
very
arbitrary,
the
particular
action
taken
by
the
court,
that
the
supreme
court
had
some
inherent
right
of
review
over
these
sentences.
congress
had
not
granted
it
and
i
would
think
that
you
would
have
something
of
an
uphill
argument
on
bringing
your
case
the
appealability
of
it
under
this
1447(d),
conceded
there
was
flagrant
error
in
what
judge
hermansdorfer
did,
how
do
you
get
beyond
his
court
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
statute
not
read
differently
then
than
it
does
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
are
not
the
judicial
council.
the
judicial
council
consists
of
the
judges
of
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
gather
that
the
sixth
circuit
was
concerned
about
what
the
judge
had
done
and
was
going
to
try
that
perhaps
set
them
straight
informally,
that
does
not
help
you
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dickey,
looking
through
this
fourth
circuit
case
that
you
cited
a
moment
ago,
the
traveler’s
protective
association
case
in
1934,
the
statute
then
apparently
read
that
an
order
of
remand
shall
be
carried
into
exertion
and
no
appeal
or
writ
of
error
from
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
so
remanding
the
cause
shall
be
allowed.
and
in
that
case,
the
fourth
circuit
held
yes,
although
you
cannot
have
an
appeal,
you
can
have
mandamus,
but
now
your
1447(d)
reads
differently.
it
says
by
appeal
or
otherwise.
now,
i
am
surprised
frankly
that
you
answered
question
that
the
statute
was
the
same
because
it
seems
to
me
that
is
quite
an
important
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fourth
circuit
said
differently
certainly.
i
would
think
that
the
present
proscription
is
broader
than
the
one
that
was
obtained
in
the
34
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
defendant’s
right
to
remove
is
not
conditioned
on
a
showing
of
prejudice
in
an
individual
case,
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
you
feel
like
we
are
more
likely
to
decide
that
it
is
reviewable,
if
we
feel
that
is
grossly
wrong
and
if
we
feel
less
that
is
grossly
wrong,
we
are
less
likely
to
find
it
reviewable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
as
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
like
yours
has
a
good
deal
more
incentive
that
get
into
an
uncrowded
court
and
get
to
a
trial
than
a
defendant
does?
