chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
74-206,
thermtron
products
against
hermansdorfer.
mr.
dickey,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
mean,
it
is
not
reviewable
language
right
out
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
has
been
suggested
to
you,
every
element
of
reviewability
is
a
creature
of
congress,
it
is
a
result
of
congress
defining
it,
so
you
have
to
point
to
specific
statute,
do
you
not,
to
use
jurisdiction
to
review?
you
claim
inherent
power
that
--
is
that
not
contrary
to
all
the
law
we
have
had
for
a
180
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
be
on
solid
ground
if
you
argued
that
section
332
title
xviii
gives
council
of
the
circuit
that
kind
of
authority,
but
where
do
you
find
the
counterpart
statute
to
section
332
vesting
this
court
with
such
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
combs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
right
to
remove,
is
that
qualified
in
some
way
or
is
it
an
absolute
right
on
the
part
of
the
litigants,
the
litigant
claiming
diversity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
could
understand
that
better
if
the
statute
said
improvidently
or
without
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
really
an
issuer
here.
how
could
we
evaluate
an
issue
like
that
on
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
concede
that
judge
hermansdorferâ€™s
action
was
in
itself
improvident,
imprudent
and
unauthorized
and
yet
stand
on
the
statute
that
justice
stewart
has
just
referred
to
which
says
that
even
if
that
is
true,
no
court
can
reveal
it.
is
that
not
the
heart
of
this
case
that
has
been
suggested
to
you
several
times?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
which
the
affirmative,
the
congress
has
permitted
a
district
judge
to
engage
in
such
an
act
without
trying
to
characterize,
same
is
true
to
some
of
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
does
not
say
the
same
thing
of
your
case,
had
it
been
venued
in
the
federal
court
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.(inaudible),
you
have
about
three
minutes
left,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
this
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
74-206,
thermtron
products
against
hermansdorfer
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
