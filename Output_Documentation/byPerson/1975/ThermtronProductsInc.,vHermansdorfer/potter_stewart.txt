it
has
long
been
recognized,
has
it
not,
that
constitutional
provision
is
subject
to
the
terms
and
conditions
for
diversity
jurisdiction
that
congress
might
specify?
justice
potter
stewart
congress
has
specified,
you
say
that
a
case
such
as
yours,
is
clearly
removable
by
your
client
to
the
district
court
and
congress
has
further
specified
that
an
order
of
a
district
judge
remanding
a
case
that
has
been
sought
to
be
removed
is
unreviewable
by
any
court.
now,
are
those
not
the
terms
and
conditions
that
congress
has
specified,
both
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
district
judge
has
told
that,
but
assume
you
are
quite
right
that
the
district
judge
was
acting
quite
erroneously
when
he
remanded
this,
but
congress
has
simply
said
that
one
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
diversity
jurisdiction
is
that
the
action
of
the
district
judge,
however
erroneous
it
may
be,
is
unreviewable?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
the
--
that
what
seems
to
be
said?
justice
potter
stewart
what
congress
seems
to
have
said,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
one
of
the
limitations
on
diversity
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
does
say,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
kind
of
odd
to
say
that
it
is
not
reviewable
with
even
though
erroneous,
unless
the
error
is
serious,
what
sort
of
a
doctrine
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
what
you
always
say
on
appeal
or
on
mandamus.
that
is
your
substance
of
your
case,
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
procedural
statute
that
congress
enacted
saying
that
it
is
not
reviewable,
no
matter
how
erroneous
by
appeal
or
otherwise
and
it
is
no
answer
to
say
to
that
statute
to
say
yes,
but
this
was
erroneous?
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
we
get
that?
this
court
has
the
jurisdiction
that
was
conferred
upon
it
by
the
united
states
constitution
plus
the
additional
jurisdiction
has
been
conferred
upon
it
by
the
congress
under
the
authorizing
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
that
is
it.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
combs,
this
is
not
the
issue
that
is
before
us
at
all,
is
it?
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
or
not
the
judge's
order
of
remand
was
reviewable
at
all
by
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
the
only
issue,
was
it
not,
not
whether
or
not
it
was
correct
or
incorrect?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
at
all
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
not
a
single,
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says
and
that
is
not
what
any
other
case
has
ever
held,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
issue
before
this
court.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not,
even
assuming
it
was
a
grossly
erroneous
remand
order,
whether
or
not
it
was
reviewable?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
a
very
strong
authority,
that
says
it
is
not,
and
that
is
an
act
of
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
what
is
before
us
whether
or
not
that
act
of
congress
means
what
it
seems
to
say?
