justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
in
connection
with
that
i
think
it
did
not
cite
1447(d)
at
all.
so
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
that
not
come
up
on
the
appeal
from
the
final
judgment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
congress
certainly
choose
that
unfortunate
language
in
1447(d),
did
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
--
to
the
other,
some
28
actions
which
this
judge
remanded
similar
to
this
diversity
action
or
they
are
just
sitting
there
in
the
state
court
or
what
has
happened
to
them?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
page
26
of
the
appendix,
i
just
want
to
--?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
what
you
are
saying
is
that
this
decision
below
opens
a
way
for
the
federal
judiciary
country-wide
to
do
away
independently
with
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
the
responsibility,
is
it
not,
for
every
federal
judge
to
follow
his
example
and
just
clear
their
calendars
of
diversity
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
only
remove
--
of
diversity
cases
â€“-
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
may
i
ask
mr.
combs?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
whether
then
on
his
docket
any
federal
employer's
liability
act
cases
or
jones
act
cases
that
had
been
brought
into
kentucky
courts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes
or
removed
to
this
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
i
gather
the
federal
question
cases
such
as
those
pending
on
the
state
courts
which
were
also
removable
might
have
been
included
in
the
remand,
might
they
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
they
are
federal
question
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
are
other
types
of
federal
question
cases
besides
federal
employer's
liability
and
jones
act
cases,
are
there
not,
that
might
also
be
removed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
will
you
not
have
in
the
sixth
circuit
pressures
as
other
circuits
have
to
get
all
cases
tried
and
off
the
docket
and
given
priority
to
bring
in
visiting
judges
from
other
places
to
help
clear
up
these
old
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
am
just
suggesting
that
there
are
other
ways
to
clear
a
calendar
than
to
(voice
overlap)?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
state
issues,
you
mean
issues
of
state
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
to
maintain
the
interruption
here,
had
you
--
then
your
--
this
case
originally
in
the
federal
court
it
could
not
be
remanded?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
the
same
considerations
might
under
into
judge
hermansdorfer's
mind?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
there
were
no
hearing
on
that
to
hear,
was
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
supposing
in
kentucky,
your
federal
jury
is
chosen
from
a
larger
geographical
area
than
the
state
court
jury,
is
it
not?
