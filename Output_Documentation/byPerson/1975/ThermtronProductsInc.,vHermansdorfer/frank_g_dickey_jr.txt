mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
i
am
with
the
law
firm
of
landrum,
patterson
&
dickey
of
lexington,
kentucky.
we
represent
the
petitioners,
thermtron
products
and
larry
dean
newhard.
it
is
indeed
remarkable
that
for
more
than
175
years,
the
district
courts,
the
circuit
courts
have
substantially
followed
and
complied
with
the
statutory
provisions,
concerning
removal
and
remand.
however,
this
matter
is
before
the
court
for
review
of
an
erroneous
order
of
remand
and
is
before
the
court
upon
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
and
for
determination
of
this
court
to
exercise
its
inherent
authority
to
intercede
and
direct
the
sixth
circuit
to
review
this
matter
and
for
issuance
of
a
writ
to
the
respondent
herein,
to
prohibit
the
respondent
from
divesting
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky,
of
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
to
compel
the
respondent
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
this
matter.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
1447(d)
says
exactly
that.
that
an
order
of
remand
is
not
reviewable
by
appeal,
mandamus,
prohibition
or
any
writ
whatsoever.
what
1447
contemplates
obviously
is
that
there
would
not
be
any
orders
of
remand
where
a
case
was
removed
properly,
where
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
case,
assumed
jurisdiction
of
the
case
and
then
turn
around
and
wrongfully
remanded
it
upon
some
arbitrary
and
discretionary
basis.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
agree
that
congress
did
intend
not
to
burden
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
with
review
of
every
order
of
remand
that
came
along.
1441
provides
that
any
civil
action
brought
in
a
state
court
of
which
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
have
original
jurisdiction
may
be
removed
by
that
defendant
from
the
state
court
to
federal
court.
section
1447(c)
provides,
if
at
anytime,
before
final
judgment,
it
appears
that
the
case
was
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction
then
it
shall
be
remanded.
in
any
case
that
it
is
removed
from
the
state
court
to
the
united
states
district
court.
if
it
is
removed
and
on
the
face
of
the
petition
for
removal,
it
is
apparent
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
then
it
is
mandatory
that
that
case
shall
be
remanded
and
there
is
no
review
of
that
order
because
the
petitioner
has
not
complied
with
the
statutory
provisions.
however,
if
a
case
is
removed
properly
or
providently
and
if
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
then
the
district
court
must
assume
jurisdiction
and
cannot
remand
that
case.
otherwise,
if
it
were
not
so,
the
district
court
could
enter
an
order
of
remand
in
any
case
it
saw
fit
and
the
petitioners,
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
or
not,
would
be
sent
back
to
state
court
without
any
remedy,
without
any
review
of
any
discretionary
or
arbitrary
decision
and
i
submit
that
would
constitute
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
there
are
cases
which
say
that
even
if
the
order
of
remand
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
the
case
goes
back
to
state
court
and
is
tried
and
comes,
in
this
case,
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky,
that
this
court
i
believe
would
say
and
has
stated
or
at
least
the
sixth
circuit
has
stated
that
that
order
of
remand
is
not
reviewable
under
section
1447(d)
for
the
simple
reason
that
that
order
of
remand
in
that
particular
case
was
made
because
the
court
obviously
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
to
hold
otherwise,
would
create
a
volume
of
appeals.
in
every
single
case
where
a
defendant
thinks
that
he
would
be
wrongfully
denied
access
to
the
federal
courts
under
his
statutory
rights
which
congress
has
granted
since
1797
--
89
that
statutory
right
would
be
denied,
that
there
would
be
a
volume
of
appeals.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
in
this
particular
instance
and
under
these
facts,
yes
sir
they
did,
because
in
this
case,
the
facts
in
record
herein
are
decisive.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
removed
this
action
from
the
pike
circuit
court
in
pike,
kentucky.
that
action
was
removed
in
strict
compliance
with
the
removal
statutes.
it
was
properly
removed
and
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
it
was
properly
removed.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
assumed
jurisdiction
over
this
matter.
the
respondent
recognized
that
he
had
jurisdiction
over
it
and
the
case
stayed
in
united
states
district
court
for
some
nine
months,
after
which
the
respondent
took
it
upon
himself
to
remand
the
case
to
the
pike
circuit
court.
and
in
this
situation
where
an
order
of
remand
was
wrongfully
entered,
the
petitioners
must
have
some
remedy
in
as
much
as
the
order
of
remand
was
based
on
purely
discretionary
considerations.
and
based
upon
considerations
that
have
no
foundation
whatsoever
in
the
legal
scheme
or
the
statutory
scheme
as
far
as
removal
and
remand
are
concerned
that
until
this
court
granted
certiorari,
the
petitioners
had
been
denied
any
remedy
whatsoever
from
the
order
of
remand.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
believe
that
reference
is
made
in
the
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
that
reference
was
made
upon
information
to
counsel
for
the
petitioners
and
even
though
it
is
not
in
the
record,
i
would
have
to
advise
the
court
that
i
have
subsequently
been
advised
that
14
cases,
i
believe
is
the
correct
number
which
consists
of
all
of
those
cases
which
were
removed
during
the
year
1973
from
the
pike
circuit
court
to
united
states
district
court.
in
14
cases,
there
were
orders
entered
show
cause
why
the
cases
should
not
be
remanded.
in
all
but
two
of
those
cases,
orders
of
remand
were
entered.
in
the
two
cases
which
the
district
court
arbitrarily
and
discretionarily
decided
to
retain
jurisdiction.
those
two
cases
of
course
are
still
in
the
united
states
district
court.
however,
the
other
12,
i
cannot
answer
you
definitely
as
to
what
action
has
been
taken.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
pike
circuit
court
judge,
judge
fenders,
has
held
a
pre-trial
conference
in
the
matter.
he
has
been
advised
and
has
considered
the
fact
that
this
case
was
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
subsequent
to
that
no
action
has
been
taken
by
the
pike
circuit
court.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
the
constitution
specifically
provides
for
controversies
being
litigated
in
federal
courts
between
citizens
of
different
states.
that
probation
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
it
is,
since
1789.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
those
are
the
terms
and
conditions
to
the
extent
that
it
contemplates
that
an
order
of
remand
will
not
be
entered
unless
the
case
is
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
is
what
the
language
of
section
1447(d)
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
exactly.
however,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
and
this
has
been
one
of
the
arguments
of
the
respondent
that
at
page
8
of
the
respondent's
brief,
this
particular
argument
is
even
made
that
even
if
an
erroneous
order
is
entered,
there
is
no
remedy,
there
is
no
review
of
that
order.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
congress
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
and
i
would
submit
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
if
that
is
what
that
says
and
if
that
is
what
congress
intended
which
i
submit
that
is
not,
singularly
any
district
court
judge
in
this
entire
country
could
arbitrarily,
discretionarily
upon
mere
whim
say
to
any
removing
defendant,
i
do
not
like
your
case,
i
am
too
busy,
i
do
not
like
this
party
and
even
though
that
party
has
a
statutory
right
of
removal,
granted
by
congress,
he
would
have
no
remedy
whatsoever
from
action
on
behalf
of
a
district
court
judge?
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
this
court
does
have
inherent
authority
over
all
lower
federal
courts,
over
all
district
court
judges
in
fact,
where
there
is
such
a
flagrant
denial
of
a
defendant’s
right
of
removal
and
denial
of
a
statutory
right,
that
there
must
be
some
extraordinary
remedy
and
this
court
does
have
the
inherent
jurisdiction
or
the
inherent
authority
to
discipline
lower
court
judges
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
as
i
pointed
out
before
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does
read
exactly
that
way,
but
obviously
it
was
not
contemplated
by
congress
to
mean
that.
although
this
court
is
not
bound
by
the
circuit
court
decisions,
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
1934
in
traveler’s
protective
association
against
smith
clearly
states,
“we
do
not
think
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
that
a
party
entitled
to
invoke
the
federal
jurisdiction
should
be
without
remedy
if
the
court
without
a
finding
expressed
or
implied
of
improper
removal
should
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
on
a
ground
arising
after
removal
and
not
affecting
jurisdiction.”
certainly,
we
do
not
find
in
the
statutes
any
evidence
of
such
intention
and
the
petitioner’s
likewise
do
not
find
any
evidence.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
that
was
under
section
28
of
the
judicial
code
and
at
that
particular
time,
there
was
also
the
same
language
as
in
section
1447(d)
forbidding
review
of
an
order
of
remand
in
a
case
such
as
the
one
that
was
taken
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
that
case
the
fourth
circuit
stated
that
leave
would
be
granted
to
the
defendant
in
that
case
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus,
requiring
the
court
below
to
hear
and
determine
the
case
and
the
court
further
stated
that
it
will
probably
not
be
necessary
for
the
defendant
to
file
such
petition
as
the
learned
judge
may
of
his
own
motion
vacate
the
order,
remanding
the
case
and
proceed
to
hear
and
decide
it.
i
would
submit
that
this
is
exactly
the
same
situation
as
in
that
case
to
the
extent
that
judge
hermansdorfer
never
made
any
finding
whatsoever
that
this
case
was
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction.
to
the
contrary
judge
hermansdorfer
admitted
that
the
case
was
properly
removed.
he
has
conceded
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
and
in
that
case
i
think
that
the
language
in
the
fourth
circuit’s
opinion
is
applicable
to
this
case
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
entitled
to
some
remedy,
some
review
of
judicial
discretion.
otherwise
i
think
every
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
to
deny
a
review
of
a
decision
such
as
this
would
squarely
fall
within
in
the
concept
of
the
constitution
and
deny
the
petitioner’s
due
process
law.
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned,
there
are
no
cases
which
specifically
interpret
section
1447(d)
because
there
has
been
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
cases,
no
decision
or
no
case
where
a
district
judge
has
flagrantly
disregarded
the
clear
and
precise
and
language
of
the
statute.
only
in
cases
where
a
matter
is
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction
shall
a
case
be
remanded.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
i
had
to
look
into
the
mind
of
judge
hermansdorfer,
which
i
obviously
cannot
do,
i
would
say
that
this
was
the
intent
of
his
order
of
remand.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
it
would
certainly
be
unless
this
court
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
if
the
order
of
remand
in
this
particular
case
is
permitted
to
stand,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
legislate
judicially
which
is
an
area
which
is
completely
within
the
realm
of
congress
and
this
court
would
also
have
to
eliminate
original
diversity
jurisdiction
as
well
as
removal.
i
think
that
not
only
would
the
order
of
remand
in
this
particular
case
apply
to
removal
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
it
would
as
far
original
jurisdiction
goes
because
this
was
a
case
which
could
have
brought
them
in
the
district
court
under
the
provisions
of
original
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
what
congress
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
congress
could
do
that.
i
think
also
that
congress
intended
that
this
matter
should
never
arise
by
reason
of
the
language
in
1447(c).
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
that
is
entirely
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
1447(d)
says
that
an
order
remanding
a
case
is
not
reviewable
on
appeal
or
otherwise.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
otherwise,
under
the
cases
which
have
been
interpreted
before
means
by
any
remedy
or
by
any
means?
however,
when
section
1447(d)
is
read
with
1447(c),
unless
a
case
was
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction,
then
the
order
of
remand
is
not
even
a
proper
order
of
remand.
the
refore,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
order
of
judge
hermansdorfer
in
this
case
was
a
void
order
to
begin
with.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
what
i
am
saying
is
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
court
has
the
inherent
authority
to
discipline
district
court
judges
as
far
as
administrative
matters
are
concerned
and
this
is
an
administrative
matter.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
this
court
has
the
authority
to
control
the
dockets
and
where
an
attempt
is
made
to
deny
the
petitioner’s
statutory
right
of
removal
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
i
feel
that
this
court
could
probably
order
under
that
particular
statute
the
implementation
of
the
relief
sought
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
well,
that
particular
judicial
council
has
been
notified
as
indicated
in
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
that
does
not
help
me
a
bit.
i
would
assume
that
is
correct.
apparently
judge
hermansdorfer
is
the
first
district
court
judge
to
infer
discretionary
powers
in
remanding
this
particular
case
and
i
would
submit
that
the
discretion
that
was
exercised
by
judge
hermansdorfer
is
in
direct
contravention
of
the
statutes
provided
by
congress.
his
decision
is
certainly
not
founded
upon
any
legal
or
jurisdictional
basis,
particularly
where
he
has
admitted
that
he
should
actually
have
the
case
and
i
am
as
concerned
as
well
as
the
judiciary
with
the
problems
which
confront
our
lower
courts
today.
however,
i
am
reminded
of
the
situation
that
existed
in
the
1880s
when
we
had
the
same
crowded
docket
that
we
have
today.
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
william
megs
(ph)
from
philadelphia
submitted
an
article
to
the
american
law
recorder
and
in
an
effort
to
determine
whether
more
federal
judges
should
be
appointed
or
whether
the
federal
court
should
restrain
themselves
from
participating
in
diversity
matters,
megs
suggested
that
the
federal
courts
eliminate
or
diversity
jurisdiction
be
eliminated
from
the
federal
courts.
and
the
reply
that
he
got
to
that
suggestion
in
the
washington
law
reporter
was,
the
fault
of
this
proposal
is
the
same
which
has
marked
many
other
suggestions.
it
is
a
proposal
how
not
to
do
professional
business,
not
how
to
do
it
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
judge
hermansdorfer's
order
is
an
example
likewise
of
how
not
to
rather
than
how
to.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
well,
the
way
i
had
read
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
that
it
read
the
same.
it
does
not
read
exactly
the
same.
my
interpretation
of
that
is
where
it
said
writ
of
error
that
that
included
all
other
writs
such
as
mandamus,
prohibition,
all
writ
statute.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
but
without
being
fictitious
may
be
otherwise
does
not
include
mandamus.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
do
have
an
absolute
statutory
right
of
removal.
what
happens
if
this
court
permits
this
case
to
stand
as
it
is
now
and
what
happens
if
all
district
court
judges
are
granted
unbridled
discretion
to
remand
any
case
involving
diversity
jurisdiction
that
they
see
fit
because
those
would
be
the
only
cases
which
would
appear
in
the
united
states
court
district
court
as
a
result
of
diverse
citizenship.
mr.
frank
g.
dickey,
jr.
that
does
not
have
to
be
diversity?
