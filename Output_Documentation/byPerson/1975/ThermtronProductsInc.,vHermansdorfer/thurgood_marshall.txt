mr.
dickey,
congress
could
remedy
and
stop
this
with
just
one
stroke
of
(inaudible)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
take
the
word
“mandate”
out
of
their
provision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
congress
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
not
say
that
he
exercised
his
discretion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
he
get
the
discretion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
not
really
the
point
is
whether
he
did
have
any
discretion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
not
support?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
assume
he
had
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
that
should
be
improvident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand
in
this
case
if
he
had
less
cases
on
his
docket,
it
would
have
not
been
remanded,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
reason
because
he
had
too
many
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
about
all
diversity
cases
in
the
country?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
interfere
with
quite
a
few
motions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
to
accommodate
one
court
they
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
you
get
some
judges
to
agree
with
you,
but
it
would
though?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that
once
the
case
is
remanded,
that
is
it
and
the
only
way
you
can
do
it
is
on
jurisdiction.
i
understand
that
the
rule,
at
least
every
case
i
read
that
is
what
it
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
we
say
“and,”
i
could
take
or
and
come
out
the
same
way.
what
case
do
you
have
on
improvidently?
what
removal
case
do
you
have
that
took
at
improvidently?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
think
you
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
brand
new?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
seven
different
places
--?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
does
not
say
impartial
tribunal,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
does
not
say
that
you
have
to
give
an
impartial
tribunal
that
is
why
you
remove
and
do
not
say
a
word
about
that
because
it
just
says
removal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
purpose,
when
it
was
passed
it
did
not
have
a
little
while?
you
talked
about
thousands
of
cases
in
the
second
circuit.
you
are
going
through
a
lot,
i
do
not
know,
i
do
not
even
know
how
many
there
are,
that
is
why
you
want
throw
him
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do,
unless
you
want
to
exception
for
your
district?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
cannot
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
each
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
the
amount
of
judicial
time
spent
if
you
had
a
hearing
on
each
case
that
would
cut
down
judicial
time,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
basis
it
is
that
this
judge
is
overloaded?
