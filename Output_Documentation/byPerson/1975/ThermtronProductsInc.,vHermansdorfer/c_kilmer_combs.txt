mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
as
the
respondent
real
parties
and
interest
and
there
would
be
a
couple
who
was
injured
on
a
mountain
road
in
pike
county,
kentucky.
but
i
do
not
hesitate
one
moment
to
support
judge
hermansdorfer
in
what
he
did
in
this
case.
at
the
outset,
i
want
to
disabuse
this
court's
mind
of
any
notion
that
judge
hermansdorfer
through
pressure
of
case
load
or
whatever,
rationally
or
otherwise
dismissed
rather
or
remanded
these
cases
that
are
referred
to
in
the
record.
to
the
contrary,
his
response
in
the
sixth
circuit
points
out
that
when
he
realized
that
there
had
been
very
few,
practically
none,
of
the
several
cases
in
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
tried
since
1968,
when
he
realized
that
there
could
be
no
trial
dates
in
the
foreseeable
future,
he
realized
that
something
had
to
be
done.
so,
he
went
through
his
entire
docket
and
he
concentrated
on
the
diversity
removal
cases
and
he
looked
at
those
cases
with
the
idea
of
determining
whether
in
his
discretion
he
might
some
way
remand
those
cases
to
the
state
courts
or
there
was
an
impartial
tribunal
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
that
is
brought
to
this
court?
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
cannot
answer
that
question
your
honor.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
they
could
have
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes.
now,
as
i
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
would
think
there
are.
i
do
not
know
of
any
on
his
docket.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
we
have
those
pressures
your
honor.
we
have
those
pressures
particularly
in
the
criminal
field.
we
have
those
pressures
particularly
in
the
social
security
field.
i
believe
judge
hermansdorfer
mentioned
that
in
his
response
in
the
sixth
circuit.
we
have
that
in
the
federal
black
long
field
which
is
again
the
social
security
which
the
sixth
circuit
has
given
priority
to,
leaving
cases
such
as
this
dormant
on
the
docket.t
hose
are
the
pressures
we
have
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
other
judges
have
been
sent
in.
i
have
tried
cases
before
other
judges.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
there
are.
this
is
simply
one
thing
that
judge
hermansdorfer
looked
at
and
what
he
did,
he
looked
at
this
cases
and
he
realized
that
these
were
state
cases,
state
issues.
in
this
particular
case,
an
automobile
accident,
the
kind
that
we
try
in
the
pike
circuit
court
everyday.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
issues
of
state
law
involving
state
occurrences,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes,
i
did.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
he
gets
that
–-
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
this
–-
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
this
is
the
real
issue.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well,
i
hope
i
can
demonstrate
it
your
honor
and
if
i
may
i
will
try
to
do
it
right
now.
now,
it
has
been
suggested
here
that
once
a
case
is
removed,
that
then
it
cannot
be
remanded
other
then
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
i
think
all
of
us
would
concede
that
if
it
is
removed
on
a
diversity
basis
and
it
later
develops
there
is
no
diversity,
then
most
certainly
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
remanded
automatically.
now,
section
1447(c)
provides
for
remand
if
the
case
is
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction.
now,
the
question
which
entered
judge
hermansdorfer’s
mind
and
i
think
really
is
the
basic
question
here,
is
whether
removed
improvidently
and
without
jurisdiction
should
be
used,
should
be
construed
in
the
conjunctive
sense
or
in
the
disjunctive
sense.
now,
judge
hermansdorfer
improvidently
removed
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
improvident
as
i
understand
the
word
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
improvident
removal
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
concede.
but
i
concede
improvident
removal,
a
removal
which
was
not
providently
made
in
order
to
secure
a
more
impartial
tribunal
which
is
the
sole
purpose
really
of
the
diversity
removal
statute
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
in
my
view
and
as
i
hopefully,
correctly
understand
the
intent
of
the
congress,
it
is
a
qualified
right.
you
have
the
right
to
remove,
but
the
congress
provided
expressly
that
if
the
district
court
finds
that
the
removal
was
improvident,
that
is
it
was
improvident
in
the
sense
that
it
was
not
necessary
in
order
to
secure
a
more
impartial
tribunal,
then
the
district
court
can
remand.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
had
the
same
problem
your
honor,
but
then
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
all
removal
diversity,
of
course
there
is
no
remand
to
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well
–-
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
be
it
as
it
may.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
now,
getting
back
to
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
no,
your
honor
it
could
not
be
dismissed.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes,
your
honor.
getting
back
hopefully
to
answering
both
questions
at
once
the
and
or,
now
this
court
pointed
out
in
de'silva
against
valentine,
351
u.s.
575
(73)
that
and
or
are
often
used
interchangeably
and
when
in
the
context
of
the
intent
of
the
statute,
the
intent
of
the
congress
is
necessary
to
construe
one
as
the
other,
this
court
would
do
so.
conceivably,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
says
and
and
it
ought
to
be
first
tested
that
way.
but
when
we
test
it,
we
find
that
as
judge
hermansdorfer
calls
it
a
logical
nonsecretory.
in
other
words,
what
he
is
saying
is
that
it
is
just
that
it
is
construed
that
way
it
does
not
make
sense.
it
does
not
logically
follow
because
if
you
use
and
in
the
conjunctive
sense
then
in
order
to
remand
the
case,
you
could
not
remand
it
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
alone.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
have
no
case
your
honor.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
but
in
all
–-
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
to
my
knowledge,
it
is,
but
i
will
say
that
it
sounds
at
least
in
my
mind
that
this
hearing
--
now
in
one
case
where
i
believe
it
was
a
jurisdictional
question
in
this
court.
this
court
construed
or
the
main
land
to
give
a
circuit
court
jurisdiction
and
that
is
the
case
of
union
insurance
company
against
the
united
states,
6
wallace
879
881.
so
when
we
look
at
it
in
that
sense
the
word
improvident
that
has
a
different
and
distinct
meaning
than
improper.
now,
improper
removal
to
note
some
error
in
removing.
improvidence
has
a
deeper
meaning,
a
meaning
where
the
parties
intend
to
provide
for
the
future,
that
is
to
provide
a
more
impartial
tribunal
and
bear
in
mind
i
say
a
more
impartial
tribunal.
so
in
my
view,
what
the
congress
was
saying,
using
the
disjunctive
or
is
that
whenever
the
district
court
finds
that
the
removal
was
improvident
and
that
it
was
not
done
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
more
impartial
tribunal
then
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
could
remand
because
after
all,
that
was
the
intent
and
the
purpose
of
the
removal
statute
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes,
it
was
your
honor
and
i
want
to
defend
judge
hermansdorfer
on
that.
he
entered
a
show
cause
order.
in
all
of
those
some
28
cases
or
whatever
and
in
each
case,
the
parties
were
given
ten
days
to
respond
and
show
why
they
would
be
prejudiced,
why
the
cause
should
not
be
remanded.
now,
i
do
not
know
that
judge
hermansdorfer
gave
too
much
or
too
little
time.
i
do
not
know
that
he
could
have
suggested
whether
he
should
or
should
not
have
suggested
a
hearing,
but
in
any
event
the
parties
were
given
an
opportunity
to
respond,
to
request
a
hearing,
to
request
an
evidentiary
hearing
if
they
desired
which
they
did
not.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes,
your
honor
and
that
the
eastern
district
is
divided
up
into
divisions
and
not
statutory,
but
divisions
nevertheless
and
they
do
come
from
all
let
us
say,
five
or
six
or
seven
counties
instead
of
just
a
one.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
some
and
each
of
those
divisions
of
course
the
jury
is
ordinarily
selected
from
within
the
division.
other
than
that,
the
jury
selection
is
substantially
the
same.
now,
judge
hermansdorfer
commented
and
i
think
maybe
mistaken
way
that
in
the
pike
circuit
court
and
especially
the
judge
to
whom
this
case
was
assigned,
there
is
no
problem
about
prejudice.
there
is
no
serious
objection
on
the
ground
of
prejudice
in
this
case.
judge
fenders
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
would
say
you
could
not
your
honor.
i
would
say
you
could
not,
but
certainly
there
was
no
sufficient
suggestion
of
prejudice
in
order
for
judge
--
to
deter
judge
hermansdorfer
from
remanding
and
he
indicated
in
his
response
to
the
sixth
circuit
that
had
there
been
such
a
suggestion,
seriously
he
would
not
have
remanded.
so
that
we
say
is
important
from
the
standpoint
that
there
was
no
local
prejudice
at
least
as
disclosed
by
the
record.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
no,
it
is
not,
but
i
suggest
that
it
arises
your
honor
on
remand
or
improvident
removal.
my
construction
is
correct,
if
the
congress
intended
for
the
district
court
to
have
a
discretion
in
remanding
removal
cases,
where
removal
is
improvident,
then
it
does
have
a
play
because
after
all
the
whole
purpose
of
removal
is
in
order
to
provide
a
more
impartial
tribunal.
if
there
is
just
an
impartial,
a
tribunal
in
the
state
court,
then
certainly
the
same
provident
and
there
it
becomes
important.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
no
sir,
it
is
improvidence.
that
is
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
but
if
i
recall
correctly,
your
honor,
this
court
has
construed
that
as
being
the
purpose
of
the
removal
statute.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
do
not
want
to
throw
him
out.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
want
to
give
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
i
want
to
give
the
district
judge
in
every
district
the
discretion
and
i
would
agree
that
it
must
be
carefully,
wisely
and
soundly
exercised
to
remand
whether
it
is
a
improvident
removal
--
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
in
each
case
upon
his
suggestion
or
upon
the
suggestion
of
the
parties.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
it
as
an
administrative
matter
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
his
response
in
the
sixth
circuit
indicates
that
it
is
on
the
same
basis
that
i
am
arguing
now.
that
is
the
district
judge
has
a
discretion
where
there
is
a
improvident
removal.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well,
certainly
as
i
see
it,
that
is
an
issue
just
as
well
as
the
reviewability.
certainly
if
it
is
appropriate
then
that
is
a
major
factor
in
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor,
but
as
noted
by
counsel
they
handled
the
thing
as
administrative
matter.
of
course
i
have
argued
in
the
brief
and
i
maintain
of
course
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
i
am
agreeing
with
sixth
circuit,
but
i
still
nevertheless
maintain
that
the
district
court
has
discretion.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well,
by
the
same
token,
i
have
no
authority
that
says
it
is
reviewable.
i
have
cited
the
authority.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well,
certainly
that
is
the
heart
of
it
because
if
that
be
true,
then
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
well,
the
statute
seems
to
say
that
he
can
remand
for
any
reason.
i
could
argue
that.
i
will
not
suggest
very
strongly
that
that
is
not
this
case
because
i
think
it
was
carefully
done.
i
think
judge
hermansdorfer
construed
this
section
1447(c)
in
the
disjunctive.
he
felt
that
something
improvidently
done
is
a
word
that
this
court
uses
all
the
time
and
that
if
it
was
removed
improvidently,
it
was
his
duty
to
remand,
but
even
so
i
will
agree
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
i
will
agree
that
the
sixth
circuit
has
no
jurisdiction
under
all
of
the
authorities
and
under
the
history
of
the
statute
as
i
understand
it
from
the
cases.
i
think
this
case
and
the
reason
that
i
have
perhaps
belabored
1447(c)
is
important
from
an
administrative
standpoint,
if
that
is
what
the
congress
intended.
if
the
congress
intended
the
district
judge
to
have
a
discretion
to
remand
where
a
case
was
improvidently
removed
to
secure
a
more
impartial
tribunal
when
it
was
not
necessary
to
do
so
then
i
think
it
should
be
said.
i
do
not
think
i
would
not
suggest
to
this
court
for
a
moment
that
that
should
be
the
basis
for
a
wholesale
remand
throughout
the
united
states.
i
would
not
suggest
that
this
court
for
a
moment
that
it
be
done
other
than
on
a
forward
looking
clear
and
impartial
basis
with
a
view
of
limiting
and
restricting
diversity,
removal,
jurisdiction,
so
that
cases
such
as
this
where
you
have
state
issues,
state
occurrences,
state
law
can
be
tried
in
the
state
courts
where
i
think
they
belong.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
yes,
i
could
your
honor.
unfortunately,
i
represent
an
elderly
couple
who
would
like
to
see
this
rule
applied
not
only
because
i
think
it
is
a
sound
rule,
but
because
they
need
to
get
their
case
tried
in
some
court
some
day.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
certainly,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
judge
fenders
has
assigned
it,
we
had
a
free
trial,
we
have
assigned
it
for
trial
one
time
and
finally
it
came
here.
i
report
to
him
periodically.
in
the
other
14
cases
incidentally,
the
counsel
involved
told
me
that
most
of
them,
virtually
all
of
them
have
been
disposed
of,
the
ones
that
have
been
remanded.
so
this
is
important
to
me
and
to
these
two
people.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
oh!
i
agree
wholeheartedly
your
honor.
mr.
c.
kilmer
combs
that
is
true.
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
grant
the
relief
sought
by
the
petitioners,
i
would
submit
that
we
would
still
have
orderly
process
in
the
district
courts
until
congress
sees
fit
to
act
which
i
realize
that
congress
has
not
been
totally
responsive
to
the
needs
of
this
court
and
other
federal
courts,
but
until
such
time
as
congress
acts,
there
would
be
orderly
process.
and
without
sounding
pride,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
for
every
wrong
there
must
be
a
remedy
and
i
would
certainly
hope
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
this
case
and
to
grant
the
relief
sought
by
the
petitioners.
thank
you.
