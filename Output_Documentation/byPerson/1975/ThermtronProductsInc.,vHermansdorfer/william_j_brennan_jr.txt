justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
not
the
substance
of
your
argument
that
we
ought
not
comes
to
1447(d)
as
literally
written,
but
as
limited
in
application
to
cases
you
regularly
sent
back
under
the
1447(c)
on
some
reason
that
might
be
error?
is
that
not
as
you
say
happened
here,
the
court
because
it
had
a
crowded
calendar,
sending
it
back
and
say
go
try
at
the
state
court,
do
not
bother
me
with
it?
