justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solicitor
general
in
the
district
court,
did
the
plaintiffs'
request
for
a
metropolitan
remedy,
was
it
accompanied
by
a
prayer
to
join
the
outlying
housing
authorities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
arguing
in
a
sense
into
the
absence
of
indispensable
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
defend
the
district
court’s
refusal
to
permit
the
joining
of
these
outlying
districts
for
the
purpose
of
offering
proof?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
judge
austin
if
he
is
still
on
the
case
or
if
his
successor
might
well
feel
that
the
issue
of
the
availability
of
a
metropolitan
remedy
would
be
foreclosed
in
favor
of
a
metropolitan
remedy
by
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
here,
might
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
if
there
had
been
as
there
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
ruling,
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
after
a
complaint
in
which
all
of
the
outlying
authorities
had
been
joined
and
there
had
been
a
finding
by
the
district
court
of
inter-district
violations
on
the
part
of
all.
would
not
that
put
the
case
in
a
somewhat
different
posture?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
this
come
in
to
the
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
was
it
authenticated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
admitted
an
evidence
in
some
factual
proceeding
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
polikoff,
what
and
is
you
conceive
the
decree
that
would
be
required
under
the
remand
of
the
court
of
appeals?
what
effect
would
it
have
on
the
local
authorities
who
were
not
previously
parties
to
(inaudible)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
so
--
but
might
it
have
some?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
can
you
justify
the
imposition
of
that
second
condition
as
against
outlying
authorities
who
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
any
of
these
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
do
you
not
have
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
then
too
was
premature
in
saying
as
it
did
that
there
should
be
a
metropolitan
remedy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
even
if
those
housing
authorities
are
not
as
you
say,
decreedly
involved,
if
hud
is
to
be
enjoined
by
the
court
to
treat
them
in
a
manner
otherwise,
then
it
would
voluntarily
treat
them,
ought
they
not
to
have
had
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
that
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
of
that
relate
simply
to
the
chicago
housing
authority
as
i
understand
it.
it
is
not
just
that
the
local
authorities
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
factually
in
the
district
court
their
activities
in
the
area
outside
of
chicago,
but
i
gather
has
been
no
factual
hearing
on
hud’s
activities
outside
of
the
chicago
housing
authority
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
theory
in
the
district
court
that
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
first
appeal
was
that
hud’s
violations
had
been
secondary
as
a
result
of
pressure
from
chicago
alderman.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
get
outside
of
the
city
of
chicago,
you
would
have
to
make
some
sort
of
a
new
showing
that
this,
that
hud
had
engaged
in
similar
violations
and
the
fact
that
it
responded
to
pressures
from
chicago
alderman
would
not
necessarily
mean
than
joliet
alderman
or
elgin
alderman
would
have
put
the
same
pressures
on
the
hud?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
question
suggest
is
not
a
hearing
about
a
remedy,
but
a
question
about
whether
there
had
been
an
initial
wrong
and
then
presumably
if
a
finding
of
a
wrong?
