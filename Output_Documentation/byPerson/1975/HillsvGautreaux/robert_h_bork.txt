mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
on
writ
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
history
of
this
litigation
is
rather
complex,
but
i
think
the
facts
that
need
to
be
stated
for
purposes
of
this
review
are
stated
rather
briefly.
respondents
are
six
black
residents
of
chicago
who
brought
this
action
in
1966
against
a
department,
an
agency
of
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development.
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
black
tenants
in
and
applicants
for
public
housing
projects
in
chicago,
their
claim
which
was
subsequently
upheld
by
the
courts
was
that
hard-aided
public
housing
through
financial
assistance
to
the
chicago
housing
authority
and
that
when
it
made
that
financial
aid
it
knew
that
members
of
the
chicago
city
council
were
blocking
the
efforts
of
chicago
housing
authority
to
place
this
housing
in
white
residential
neighborhoods
thus
reinforcing
patterns
of
residential
segregation
and
most
of
the
tenants
and
applicants
here
were
black.
it
should
be
said
in
this
case
by
the
way,
i
think
it
is
of
some
interest
that
when
we
--
as
this
case
is
developed,
to
phrase
a
black
residential
neighborhood
or
a
limited
housing
neighborhood
means
one
with
more
than
30%
blacks.
so
it
can
be
30%
black
and
70%
white
and
still
for
purposes
of
this
case
be
described
as
a
black
neighborhood
or
it
can
be
within
one
mile
of
any
such
census
tract
that
still
be
described
as
a
black
neighborhood.
respondents
brought
a
companion
suit
against
the
chicago
housing
authority
and
the
court
found
that
that
authority
had
in
fact
engaged
in
these
discriminatory
practices.
it
issued
an
injunction
among
the
terms
of
which
were
an
order
to
halt
the
practices,
to
build
the
next
700
dwelling
units
in
the
substantial
a
year
over
70%
white
residential
areas
of
chicago
and
to
locate
at
least
three
fourths
of
those
units
would
be
in
those
neighborhoods.
now,
in
the
parallel
action
against
hud,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
the
district
courts
dismissal
of
the
complaint
and
held
that
hud’s
knowing
act
re-essences
in
chas,
chicago
housing
authorities
admittedly
discriminatory
housing
program
brought
hud
in
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
of
section
601
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
make
no
contention
here
of
course
that
hud
did
not
violate
those
provisions
by
knowingly
funding
chicago
housing
authority,
but
i
think
simple
justice
to
the
hud
officials
involved
requires
me
at
least
to
note
that
during
the
time
of
the
violation
according
to
district
court,
hud
made
efforts,
consistent
efforts
to
correct
what
was
happening
and
had
succeeded
in
some
respects
and
the
court
of
appeals
itself
said
that
was
fully
sympathetic
with
hud’s
dilemma
of
being
forced
to
choose
between
the
funding
of
construction
of
public
housing
in
black
neighborhoods
or
denying
housing
all
together
to
thousands
of
needy
negro
families.
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
appeal
emphasized
that
its
holding
should
not
be
construed
as
granting
a
broad
license
to
interfere
with
the
programs
and
actions
of
what
it
described
as
an
already
beleaguered
federal
agency
and
it
suggest
that
the
district
court
might
find
that
little
equitable
relief
was
needed
beyond
a
best-efforts
clause
necessary
to
remedy
the
wrongs
that
had
been
committed.
at
that
point
in
the
district
court,
the
actions
against
hud
and
cha
were
consolidated.
the
district
court
did
enter
a
best-efforts
clause
and
they
were
still
outstanding
of
course
against
hud
and
they
were
still
outstanding
of
course
the
relief
against
the
chicago
housing
authority.
the
district
court
specifically
rejected
plaintiffs’
proposal
for
a
hearings
to
develop
a
plan
of
metropolitan
relief
for
the
areas
surrounding
the
city
of
chicago.
upon
appeal,
a
wholly
new
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
with
one
judge
dissenting,
reversed
and
remanded
for
consideration
of
a
comprehensive
metropolitan
area
plan
and
that
is
the
order.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
recall
whether
there
was
a
prayer
at
that
stage.
there
was
a
prayer
which
was
granted
in
the
district
court
after
the
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
believe
there
was
a
request.
yes
there
was.
i
believe
there
was
a
request
to
join
them
in
the
prospect
in
the
district
court
before
the
appeal
so
that
a
much
(inaudible)
plan
could
be
drawn
up.
but
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
that
a
comprehensive
metropolitan
area
plan
be
now
considered
is
what
is
judicial
here,
meanwhile
district
court
has
permitted
respondents
to
file
a
supplemental
complaint
to
add
as
party’s
defendant.
the
11
local
housing
authorities
outside
the
city
of
chicago
as
well
as
the
illinois
housing
development
authority,
the
northeastern
illinois
planning
commission
and
the
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
local
government
affairs
and
respondents’
current
assertion
in
this
court
is
that
housing
in
six
illinois
counties,
cook,
a
part
of
which
is
the
city
of
chicago,
but
much
of
which
is
not.
dupage,
kane,
lake,
mchenry
and
will,
those
counties
which
contain
12
local
housing
authorities
and
over
300
cities,
villages
and
townships
are
the
area
which
should
be
swept
into
this
case
and
put
under
judicial
supervision
and
used
as
a
remedy,
to
remedy
an
act
of
segregation
that
occurred
entirely
within
the
city
of
chicago.
now,
none
of
these
counties
or
housing
authorities
or
municipalities
has
been
in
this
case
previously.
none
of
them
has
been
found
to
have
committed
any
acts
of
discrimination,
much
less
any
acts
of
discrimination
related
in
any
way
to
what
happened
in
chicago.
the
objection
of
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
precisely
this.
the
secretary
of
hud
will
be
required
to
impose
obligations
upon
communities
that
are
without
fault
in
order
to
achieve
a
remedy
for
respondents
that
runs
contrary
to
statutory
obligations
and
a
remedy
that
is
not
premised
entirely
upon
wrong
doing
in
chicago.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
not
actually
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
arguing
at
this
case
is
like
milliken
against
bradley
in
the
sense
that
district
court
is
being
directed
in
effect
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
exceed
the
scope
of
allowable
equitable
remedies
and
i
am
arguing
also
that
the
swann
case
has
something
to
say
here
about
this
case.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
if
the
--
i
think
of
the
plaintiffs,
i
think
this
case
is
just
like
the
milliken.
if
the
plaintiffs
allege
and
prove
an
inter-district
violation,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
but
that
is
not
the
posture
this
case
is
in
now
and
i
think
as
this
court
said
in
milliken,
a
controlling
principle
which
is
consistently
been
stated
in
the
holdings
of
this
court
is
that
the
scope
of
the
remedy
is
determined
by
the
nature
and
the
extent
of
the
violation
and
as
the
concurring
opinion
put
it
there,
the
courts
there
were
in
error
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
thought
what
the
remedy
they
thought
necessary
was
simply
not
commensurate
with
the
constitutional
violation
found
and
that
is
what
i
think
is
difficulty
here.
i
want
to
discuss
milliken,
but
i
first
want
to
develop
a
point
which
is
not
fully
developed
in
our
brief,
although
it
is
present
and
which
in
and
of
itself
seems
to
me
fully
dispositive
of
this
case.
as
i
said,
respondents
here
proved
a
violation
which
was
entirely
within
the
city
of
chicago
and
relief
was
ordered
there
quite
properly
and
on
this
last
appeal,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
consideration
of
metropolitan
relief.
now,
it
gave
a
couple
of
reasons
why
it
thought
metropolitan
relief
was
essential.
one
was,
that
intra
city
relief
had
become
less
valuable
while
the
case
was
pending
because
the
number
of
neighborhoods
with
fewer
than
30%
black
or
outside
of
one
mile
within
a
census
tract
of
less
than
30%
black
residence
had
declined
so
that
there
was
difficulty
getting
sites
to
put
enough
public
housing
in
areas
with
more
than
70%
white
population.
well,
i
think
it
is
important
to
ask
why
that
is
true
and
it
is
true
not
because
of
any
action
by
any
governmental
unit.
it
is
true
because
of
demographic
shifts,
shifts
in
residential
patterns
in
the
chicago
area.
thousands
of
individuals
and
families
made
personal
choices
which
they
are
legally
free
to
make
and
as
result
we
are
told
the
federal
courts
must
pursue
those
demographic
shifts
into
outlying
cities
and
townships
and
municipalities.
the
court
is
not
pursuing
governmental
action,
or
anything
connected
with
governmental
action.
they
are
pursuing
populations
and
demographic
shifts.
now,
the
other
thing,
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
it
is
quite
clear
in
its
opinion,
is
that
it
was
reacting
not
to
the
constitutional
violation
in
chicago,
but
it
was
reacting
to
the
phenomenon
of
white
flight
and
it
was
reacting
to
sociological
and
demographic
predictions
about
the
distant
future,
1984
was
mentioned,
the
year
2000
was
mentioned.
the
remedy
in
short
is
actually
addressed
to
a
predicted
de
facto
segregation
and
not
to
the
limited
proven
de
jure
segregation
in
public
housing
in
chicago.
i
happened
to
think
that
the
sociological
and
demographic
predictions
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
are
not
accurate
and
if
sociology
were
relevant
to
this
court,
to
this
case,
i
would
think
that
the
remedy
chosen
to
deal
with
sociological
trends
is
the
worst
possible
remedy
one
could
choose,
but
that
is
not
the
point.
chasing
demographic
shifts
and
attacking
purely
de
facto
living
patterns
i
think
is
not
a
proper
remedial
function
of
courts
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
that
fact
in
swann
against
charlotte-mecklenburg
and
that
seems
to
me
sufficient
to
require
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
here.
but
aside
from
the
principle
of
swann,
there
is
the
holding
of
milliken
against
bradley.
this
violation
took
place
as
i
have
said
repeatedly
within
the
city
of
chicago
and
it
is
therefore
inappropriate
to
frame
relief
in
an
area
that
encompasses
300
other
governmental
units,
more
than
300
other
towns
and
villages
with
a
complete
strangers
to
the
action
and
to
the
violation.
now,
respondent's
attempted
answer
to
this
is
that
this
is
not
inter-district
relief
in
the
milliken
sense
because
it
is
not
inter-district
relief
as
to
hud,
since
hud
may
operate
over
metropolitan
areas.
that
is
fallacious,
that
answer
is
fallacious
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is,
that
this
remedy,
even
if
it
is
nominally
directed
or
actually
directed
only
against
hud
in
a
legal
sense,
will
actually
destroy
the
autonomy
and
some
of
the
political
processes
of
the
cities
and
housing
authorities,
who
have
no
connection
with
the
violation
in
chicago
and
secondly,
i
think
it
is
irrelevant,
it
is
a
fallacious
answer
because
the
remedy
would
compel
hud
and
this
cannot
be
gotten
around,
this
remedy
would
compel
hud
to
ignore
obligations
placed
upon
it
by
congress.
now,
respondent’s
argument
as
to
the
first
point
is
that
the
1974
act
permits
hud
to
bypass
local
communities
and
to
deal
with
private
developers.
and
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
they
may
deal
with
private
developers.
i
do
not
think
they
used
to
comply
with
the
zoning
ordinance
and
so
forth
in
the
city
you
are
in.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
they
deal
with
private
developers
in
any
particular
community,
but
under
certain
limitations.
but
my
first
point
is
that
even
if
those
limitations
were
not
present
in
the
statute
about
what
hud
may
do,
it
is
wrong
to
say
that
these
communities
are
not
being
involved
in
this
lawsuit
because
the
result
would
still
be
that
communities
that
have
done
nothing
wrong
whatever
and
that
neither
need
nor
want
any
public
housing
would
have
public
housing
placed
upon
them
by
court
order.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
must
operate
through
communities,
state
or
local
housing
authorities
or
with
private
developers
under
certain
limitations.
but
it
does
not
--
hud
does
not
build
these.
currently,
hud
is
not
building
anything,
it
is
not
seizing
property.
it
is
subsidizing
rental.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
they
do
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
when
i
think
what
is
going
to
happen
and
in
fact
mandates
if
it
work,
but
respondents
say
that
the
decree
does
not
allow
them
to
nor
do
they
wish
to
override
local
zoning
ordinance.
it
is
not
what
is
going
to
happen
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
area
around
chicago
is
it
zoning
changes
are
going
to
have
to
be
requested
to
put
up
multi
family
dwellings
of
this
size
and
has
to
be
at
least
of
a
certain
size,
50
to
100
families
to
make
it
economically
feasible.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
assume
mr.
justice
powell
either
in
this
case
or
in
a
separate
case
we
will
then
have
serious
of
litigation
about
whether
refusal
to
make
zoning
changes
or
variances
was
discriminatory.
i
think
that
is
the
way
it
would
have
to
work
out.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
judge
austin,
with
the
direction
in
that
opinion
and
that
order
is
bound
to
feel
that
he
has
to
enter
some
kind
of
a
metropolitan
remedy.
but
my
point
is,
that
quite
aside
from
the
limitations
placed
upon
hud,
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
point,
about
dealing
with
local
communities,
if
it
were
true,
which
it
is
not,
if
it
were
true
that
hud
could
deal
with
private
developers
and
ignore
the
local
community,
those
local
communities
would
have
public
housing
they
do
not
need,
they
do
not
want,
they
have
committed
no
constitutional
violation,
and
they
are
going
to
provide
the
services
with
a
police
protection,
the
fire
protection,
the
additional
schooling
for
families
with
children,
to
benefit
citizens
of
chicago.
but,
and
i
want
to
say
this,
my
point
is
not
merely,
that
that
is
not
a
proper
equitable
remedy.
my
point
is,
that
a
rather
extraordinary
legal
principle
is
being
formulated
here.
well,
we
remember
what
happened
in
this
case.
chicago
housing
authority
was
held
responsible
because
of
the
acts
of
the
chicago
city
council.
hud
was
then
held
responsible
because
of
the
acts
of
the
chicago
housing
authority
and
now
wholly
uninvolved
town
governments
are
to
be
held
responsible
because
hud
can
reach
them,
that
is
all.
hud
is
to
be
made
in
to
a
conduit
through
which
the
impact
of
local
violations
flows
outward
to
all
other
governments
in
the
area,
the
respondents
or
the
district
court
think
it
useful
to
reach.
now,
i
say
that
is
an
extraordinary
legal
principle
because
it
is
federal
assistance
and
federal
authority
increases
not
only
in
this
field,
but
in
all
kinds
of
fields.
that
principle
will
expand
the
equitable
powers
of
district
courts
to
unheard
of
dimensions.
in
this
very
case,
i
think,
it
is
clear
that
this
court
has
been
pushed
from
performing
a
traditional,
judicial
function
of
framing
an
equitable
remedy
into
a
position
what
is
going
to
become
necessarily
a
metropolitan
wide
land
use
and
social
planning
agency
on
a
continuing
basis.
i
think
all
of
that
would
be
bad
enough,
but
it
is
also
true
in
respondent’s
brief,
i
think
obscures
this
fact
that
metropolitan
relief
would
require
hud
to
violate
limitations
built
into
which
authority
by
congress.
now,
it
is
all
very
well,
i
think
respondent's
counsel
say
that
congress
contemplated
metropolitan
planning
and
that
hud
officials
endorsed
metropolitan
planning
and
that
is
entirely
true.
hud
does
that
and
hud
will
continue
to
think
in
planning
metropolitan
terms
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
case.
but
it
is
also
true
that
in
metropolitan
planning
congress
has
placed
limitations
and
processes
that
must
be
observed
and
that
a
court
order
would
have
to
sweep
away.
and
the
relief
proposed
here,
i
think
would
reverse
the
congressional
thrust
in
the
1974
amendments
to
1974
housing
act
to
return
more
decision
making
to
local
communities
and
let
me
indicate
briefly
a
couple
of
examples
of
how
coercion
would
be
necessary
or
how
violation
of
hud’s
statutory
mandate
would
be
necessary.
one
example,
a
community
which
receives
funding
from
hud
for
community
development
activities
under
the
block
grant
program
which
is
title
i
of
the
1974
act,
is
required
to
prepare
a
housing
assistance
plan
of
its
own
housing
needs
in
that
community
as
part
of
its
application.
now,
the
statute
requires
or
it
is
required
that
that
housing
assistance
plan
must
be
prepared
by
citizen
participation
including
two
public
hearings
for
the
citizens
and
it
must
be
later
reviewed
and
commented
upon
by
the
relevant
area
wide
planning
agencies
to
the
state
or
the
locality.
hud
cannot
unilaterally
decide
to
work
with
a
private
developer
in
order
to
put
up
a
public
housing
in
that
community.
instead,
hud
is
require
under
section
213
of
the
act
to
forward
any
proposal
by
private
developer
for
public
housing
to
the
community
and
the
community
is
required
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
proposal
is
consistent
with
its
housing
assistance
plan
which
it
has
been
required
to
make
and
which
had
been
made
through
citizen
participation.
if
a
community
says
their
proposal
for
public
housing
is
not
consistent,
then
secretary
cannot
go
forward
unless
she
determines,
despite
that,
that
the
proposal
is
consistent
with
the
community’s
own
housing
assistance
plan,
and
if
hud
does
that
and
goes
forward,
and
the
community
disagrees
then
the
community
may
seek
judicial
review.
that
is
all
built
into
the
1974
act.
any
community
and
the
number
of
these
communities
do
that
has
the
block
grant
program
and
a
housing
assistance
program,
all
of
this
would
have
to
be
swept
away
if
you
are
talking
about
hud
dealing
with
the
private
developer
without
interfering
with
the
community.
if
a
town
is
not
a
participant
in
that
plan,
then
section
213
cf,
title
ii
applies,
secretary
consults
with
the
town,
of
course
the
town’s
wished
has
have
influence,
but
the
secretary
shall
not
approve
a
proposal
there,
even
from
a
private
developer,
unless
she
determines
that
there
is
need
for
federally
assisted
public
housing,
taking
into
consideration
the
applicable
state
plans
and
finding
that
there
is
or
will
be
available
in
the
area
public
facilities
and
services
adequate
to
service,
their
proposed
development.
now,
i
think
that
court
ordered
metropolitan
relief
in
this
case
no
matter
how
gently
it
has
gone
about,
no
matter
how
it
trained
is
bound
to
require
hud
to
ignore
the
safeguards
of
local
autonomy
and
local
political
processes,
the
very
safeguards
that
the
congress
deliberately
built
into
the
1974
act.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
would
put
the
case
in
an
entirely
different
posture
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
we
have
here
the
remedy
appropriate
to
a
case
which
is
not
here
which
is
our
problem.
finally,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
anything
done
within
chicago
produced
any
segregatory
effect
in
any
other
city
and
certainly
not
segregatory
effect
between
chicago
and
any
other
city.
now,
there
is
exhibit
11
which
has
been
offered
in
this
case
and
which
is
a
map
that
is
at
the
back
of
respondents’
brief
and
i
must
say,
that
that
exhibit
11
does
not
prove
anything.
it
does
not
prove
segregation.
it
does
not
even
raise
a
prima-facie
case
of
segregation
in
any
outlying
city
and
it
certainly
does
not
prove
any
causation
between
what
happened
in
public
housing
in
chicago
and
the
situation
in
any
outlying
city.
remember
that
these
shaded
areas,
these
limited
housing
areas,
they
get
shaded
if
they
are
more
than
30%
black,
those
are
not
solid
black
communities
or
they
get
shaded
if
they
are
within
one
mile
of
a
30%
black
census
tract.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
respondents'
counsel
drew
this
map
and
put
it
into
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
were
no
alternatives
available
to
respondents
to
move
into
public
housing
in
white
areas
outside
of
chicago.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
believe,
i
mean,
i
am
subject
to
correction,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
is
authenticated.
i
think
it
was
drafted
by
respondents'
counsel
as
an
illustration
and
put
in.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
i
think
it
was
just
admitted,
i
do
not
think
it
is
been
there,
i
do
not
think
any
testimony
taken
about
how
this
was
drawn
or
the
lines
or
anything
else,
but
let
me
make
a
point
about
it.
if
one
looks
at
this
rather
large
area
with
two
close
together
dots
for
housing
areas
here,
right
below
the
city
of
chicago,
that
is
the
robbins,
that
is
the
town
of
robbins.
now,
that
looks
like
somebody
has
placed
housing
in
the
middle
of
a
black
area
and
maybe
that
is
supposed
to
be
segregatory.
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
town
of
robbins
itself
is
98.1%
black
and
that
this
census
tract,
upon
which
that
public
housing
is
located
is
94.4%
black.
so
there
is
no
way
for
the
town
of
robbins
to
put
up
any
public
housing
that
is
not
in
a
black
area.
so
that
does
not
show
segregation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
has
its
own
government,
i
do
not
know
if
it
has
a
housing
authority
because
many
of
these
communities
do
not
have
housing
authorities.
it
has
handled
--
i
do
not
know
if
robbins
has
a
housing
authority
or
whether
it
operates
thought
its
city
council.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
right.
i
take
it
as
no.
directly
below
that
one
will
see
a
black
area
with
six
black
dots.
the
three
to
the
right,
to
the
east
are
in
the
city
of
east
chicago
heights.
that
city
is
98.2%
black
and
the
public
housing
happens
to
be
on
the
census
tract
which
is
80%
black.
there
is
again
no
possibility
that
any
public
housing
could
be
put
up
in
those
two
cities
that
was
not
in
a
black
census
tract.
so
this
map,
if
it
showed
it,
does
not
even
raise
a
prima-facie
case
of
segregation
in
the
suburbs.
if
a
de
jure
prima-facie
case
of
segregation
in
the
suburbs,
it
would
certainly
not
show
that
there
was
any
connection
between
what
happened
in
chicago
and
that
--
i
will
take
it
back,
i
am
told
that
the
map
is
not
exhibit
11
it
is
just
an
exhibit
in
the
brief,
it
is
an
attachment
in
the
brief.
milliken
against
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
fairly
so
right.
the
respondents
offered
it
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
guess
it
is
offered
as
an
indication
of
what
they
regard
as
prima-facie
evidence.
i
do
not
think
it
is
prima-facie
evidence
of
anything.
our
final
submission
is
that
milliken
against
bradley
governs
this
case,
the
faults
of
one
locality
or
being
a
--
made
a
jurisdictional
predicate
for
area
wide
social
planning
on
communities
that
are
in
no
way
involved
and
i
think
swann
suggest
that
judicial
attempts
to
follow
demographic
shifts
that
are
not
due
to
any
constitutional
violation,
really
involves
the
court
in
doing
little
more
than
requiring
racial
balance
as
a
constitutional
mandate
where
no
constitutional
violation
has
occurred.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
let
me
address
the
question
of
the
remand
because
i
think
that
would
be
totally
improper
in
this
case.
a
remand
would
send
this
case
back
under
respondents'
counsel
theory
to
consider
a
metropolitan
wide
relief
which
we
think
can
be
shown
now
and
we
think
we
have
shown
now
as
a
matter
of
law
to
be
improper.
secondly,
in
answer
the
question
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
would
do
no
good
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
bring
in
local
communities
for
a
hearing
about
a
remedy.
they
might
be
heard
about
a
remedy,
they
might
prevail,
or
they
might
be
overridden,
but
they
are
being
subjected
to
hearings
and
a
possible
remedy
when
they
have
committed
no
violation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
quite
agree
in
that
case
if
the
respondents'
counsel
wants
to
file
a
new
case
or
amend
this
case
and
start
a
new
lawsuit
about
an
inter-district
violation
of
the
fact,
of
course.
now,
if
we
talk
about
ordering
hud
alone
and
this
not
being
inter-district
as
to
hud
as
a
somatic
game,
it
really
ought
to
go
on
unchallenged.
the
truth
is,
as
i
stressed
in
my
opening
statement,
there
would
be
an
enormous
practical
impact
on
innocent
communities
who
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
this
housing.
we
will
have
to
house
a
plaintiff
class
from
chicago
which
they
wronged
in
no
way,
who
is
--
political
processes
which
are
respected
by
congress
will
be
overridden
and
there
is
no
way
that
is
not
an
inter-district
remedy
even
though
you
used
hud
as
the
conduit.
it
is
very
dangerous
to
say
that
anytime
a
federal
agency
does
anything
wrong
in
any
locality
because
the
federal
agency
has
jurisdiction
over
a
very
wide
area,
the
federal
agency
can
be
asked
to
sweep
in
the
residents
of
that
entire
area,
although
they
were
not
involved
in
any
wrongdoing
and
in
any
shape
or
form.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
court
might
not.
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
if
the
district
court
were
not
to
issue
any
metropolitan
decree,
it
could
only
be
because
this
court
vastly
modified
what
that
court
of
appeals
said
because
that
was
a
direction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh.
hud
does
study
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
that
is
a
different
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
a
different
lawsuit
mr.
justice
marshall.
if
the
question
were,
is
hud
adequately
exercising
its
discretion
under
its
statute
that
would
be
a
totally
different
statute,
a
lawsuit.
this
is
not
that
lawsuit.
this
is
a
constitutional
violation
in
chicago
with
no
allegation
that
hud
is
acting
improperly
anywhere
else,
but
hud
is
to
be
used
because
of
its
wide
jurisdiction
as
a
conduit
to
take
the
chicago
violation
out
and
bring
somebody
else
in
for
a
remedy.
now,
on
a
remand,
i
think
it
is
improper
because
hud
is
going
to
have
to
litigate
something
that
i
think
is
improper
to
begin
with.
these
communities
are
going
to
be
required
to
litigate
it.
we
have
got
11
housing
authorities
in
there
who
are
not
even
alleged
to
have
done
anything
wrong.
so
that
a
remand,
i
think
would
be
quite
wrong.
hud
wide-spread
jurisdiction
was
not
intended
to
wipe
out
the
local
political
units
that
are
supposed
to
make
these
decisions
for
their
community.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
does
not
wipe
out
the
lines.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
hud
may
do
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
hud
looks
at
it
for
planning
purposes,
but
when
it
is
finished
planning,
it
does
not
implement
a
plan
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
local
communities
housing
assistance
plan
for
example.
the
local
community
participates
politically
in
this
and
has
a
number
of
checks
upon
this.
so,
but
what
is
obviously
inevitable
here
is
that
in
some
form
that
local
autonomy
is
going
to
be
overridden
or
bypassed
and
we
are
going
to
wind
up
with
effective
remedies
in
towns
that
have
done
nothing
wrong.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
the
order
against
hud
entered
by
the
district
court
mr.
justice
white
was
a
best-efforts
order
and
hud
is
cooperating
in
the
chicago
area,
and
will
use
its
best
efforts
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
the
area,
i
am
sorry,
i
am
sorry.
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
best-efforts
order.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
see
the
legal
predicate
for
an
order
against
hud
in
the
chicago
housing
area
anymore
because
it
did
something
wrong
in
chicago.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
correct
mr.
justice
white.
however,
i
would
certainly
would
object
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
hud
is
not
being
shown
to
and
does
not,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
to
violate
the
constitution
in
anyway
in
the
chicago
housing
area
and
it
is
not
doing
it
in
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
certainly
do
mr.
justice
white
and
let
me
explain
why.
i
would
object
to
it
if
the
request
for
relief
in
this
case
were
hud
is
been
found
to
acquiesce
in
the
acts
of
the
chicago
housing
authority,
and
therefore,
we
are
going
to
order
hud
to
stop
it
in
new
york,
detroit,
los
angeles,
and
san
diego.
hud
has
not
done
anything
like
that
and
i
think
it
ought
not
to
be
subjective
to
an
order
which
is
an
equivalent
of
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
must
mr.
justice
white
there
has
been
no
showing
of
a
predisposition
on
the
part
on
the
part
of
hud
to
this.
in
fact,
all
of
the
courts
agreed
that
hud
opposed
what
was
happening
in
chicago,
made
some
progress
and
in
opposing
it,
but
ultimately
acquiesced
and
financed
things
they
should
not
have
because
of
the
desperate
need
for
housing
and
plaintiffs’
affidavits
about
the
kind
of
housing
they
were
living
in
before
hud
put
up
this
public
housing
in
chicago
illustrates
that
desperate
need
for
public
housing
that
existed
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
hud
does
think
that
it
ought
to
work
as
its
statutory
mandate
requires
throughout
the
metropolitan
area.
it
does
not
think
it
ought
to
be
subject
to
a
court
order
which
is
going
to
change
its
statutory
mandate
throughout
that
area
when
it
has
done
nothing
wrong
in
that
area.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did,
mr.
justice
white
and
i
think
respondents'
counsel
too.
hud
keeps
saying
that
it
is
important
to
work
in
the
metropolitan
area
and
that
it
will
do
so
as
its
statute
allows
and
the
statute
allows
that,
encourages
that,
but
it
does
place
limitations
and
there
is
no
reason
to
destroy
those
limitations
when
nothing
is
wrong
has
been
done
at
that
area.
