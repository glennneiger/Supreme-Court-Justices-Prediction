mr.
alexander
polikoff
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wish
to
make
two
basic
points
this
morning.
the
first
is,
that
a
remedial
order
confined
to
hud
and
extending
throughout
the
hud
defined
chicago
housing
market
area
is
a
practical
option
open
to
the
district
judge.
it
would
be
an
appropriate
order
in
this
case
and
it
would
not
be
an
inter-district
order
under
milliken
and
incidentally
it
would
not
be
an
order
that
answers
to
the
description
that
the
solicitor
general
gave
you
of
the
order
that
was
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
have
a
feeling
that
we
are
addressing
two
different
cases
here
this
morning.
the
solicitor
general’s
view
of
what
is
mandated
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
will
show
in
a
moment
is
not
my
view
of
what
that
court
has
mandated
or
indeed
of
what
would
be
proper
under
equitable
principles
the
solicitor
general
and
i,
i
am
sure
share.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
it
would
have
to
be
exercised
your
honor
by
private
developers
or
by
local
housing
authorities
and
not
by
hud.
hud
has
never
exercised
the
power
of
imminent
domain
in
the
operation
of
these
programs
and
the
exercise
of
that
power
presents
no
problem,
no
obstacle
in
framing
equitable
relief
here
where
a
developer,
public
or
private,
has
acquired
land,
it
then
applies
to
hud
for
funds
to
promote
a
subsidized
housing
project
on
that
land.
if
it
has
not
acquired
the
land,
it
never
comes
to
hud
for
the
money
in
the
first
place.
we
have
never
contended
in
this
case
and
we
do
not
contend
now
that
the
zoning
power
is
at
issue.
the
decree
which
the
solicitor
general
suggests
mandates
a
judicial
supervision
of
the
exercise
of
zoning
powers
by
local
communities
is
not
the
decree
we
envision
and
it
is
not
in
our
opinion
the
decree
compelled
by
the
court
of
appeals
order
in
this
case.
i
think
the
suggestion
and
it
is
one
of
many
similar
suggestions
in
the
government’s
brief
and
in
the
argument
here
this
morning
that
a
parade
of
horrors
will
be
the
result
of
implementation
of
a
metropolitan
remedial
plan
at
the
district
court
level
is
simply
inaccurate.
as
our
brief
indicates,
and
we
have
cited
cases
and
hud
regulations
to
this
effect,
subsidized
housing
is
required
to
comply
with
local
zoning
and
other
land
use
control
regulations.an
d
nothing
we
have
proposed
in
this
case
to
date
and
nothing
said
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
judgment
changes
that
fact
and
the
remand
before
the
district
court,
we
would
not
propose
anything
different
that
i
am
saying
here
right
now.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
it
might
have
none,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
it
might
have
an
indirect
impact
and
one
of
the
problems
is
we
cannot
know
because
as
my
first
of
two
points
and
i
have
not
even
told
you
yet
what
the
second
is,
my
first
of
two
points
was
that
an
order
might
be
confined
to
hud
alone.
if
the
district
court
in
its
judgment
on
remand
did
confine
such
an
order
to
hud
alone,
it
would
have
no
direct
impact
upon
local
housing
authorities.
they
would
not
be
decreedly
(ph)
involved,
the
order
would
not
run
against
them
at
all.
they
would
only
be
indirectly
involved
in
the
following
way.
if
and
when
a
local
housing
authority
voluntarily
chose
to
apply
for
hud
subsidy
funds
in
order
to
develop
some
housing,
a
choice,
i
repeat
for
emphasis
would
be
voluntarily
made
on
its
part,
there
would
be
no
impact
if
it
chose
not
to
do
so,
it
would
then
be
subject
to
the
conditions
that
hud
imposed
on
the
use
of
federal
funds
offered
to
applying
housing
authorities.
in
our
view
as
indicated
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
one
conceivable
remedial
decree
might
be
a
direction
to
hud
to
impose
two
additional
conditions
on
the
use
of
federal
funds
in
the
chicago
housing
market
area
by
those
who
apply
for
such
funds.
the
first
such
condition,
a
condition
essentially
all
ready
contained
in
hud
regulations
would
be
that
housing
be
predominantly
provided
in
the
future
in
white
rather
than
black
neighborhoods
because
the
history
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
violation
in
this
case
is
confining
it
to
the
black
neighborhoods.
the
second
condition
would
be
that
a
portion
of
the
housing
thus
provided
be
made
available
to
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
as
a
remedial
measure.
now
--
mr.
alexander
polikoff
we
do
not.
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
imposition
of
that
condition
should
be
imposed
against
persons
who
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate.
that
was
the
inherent
implication
in
your
question
of
the
solicitor
general
and
i
would
like
to
advise
your
honor
that
the
solicitor
general
was
correct
before
the
district
court,
long
before
the
court
reached
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
request
the
district
court
to
enter
an
order,
i
will
call
it
a
milliken
type
order
if
you
will,
in
which
he
determined
that
it
would
be
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
consider
housing
market
area
relief,
but
we
said
before
doing
so,
it
would
be
necessary
to
add
the
governmental
parties,
not
the
local
communities
that
the
solicitor
general
talks
about
in
the
scores
and
in
the
hundreds
because
they
do
not
provide
housing,
robbins
does
not
provide
housing
it
is
the
cook
county
housing
authority
which
does,
we
suggest
that
before
the
district
court
embarked
on
a
consideration
of
metropolitan
relief
and
because
of
the
dictates
of
milliken,
the
appropriate
affected
party
should
be
at
it.
we
suggested
it
to
the
district
court
which
parties
we
would
suggest
the
adding,
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
housing
authorities
in
the
housing
market
area
potentially
to
the
affected.
we
suggested
that
the
district
court
should
direct
hud
and
cha
to
indicate
what
additional
parties
if
any
ought
to
be
at
it
and
only
at
that
stage
we
said
to
the
district
court
should
you
consider
to
--
should
you
proceed
to
consider
a
metropolitan
plan,
indeed
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
submitted
a
proposed
order
in
connection
with
that
motion
to
the
district
court
in
which
we
specifically
said,
the
court
is
not
now
called
upon
to
decide
whether
to
order
metropolitan
relief,
but
only
that
for
the
consideration
of
such
relief
that
is
appropriate
to
add
these
parties.
that
motion
was
denied
and
--
mr.
alexander
polikoff
i
think
it
does
your
honor
and
--
mr.
alexander
polikoff
that
is
exactly
correct.
it
is,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
said
speaking
for
the
court
in
the
recent
case
of
wheeler
versus
barrera,
the
case
involving
teaching
in
parochial
schools
by
publicly
paid
teachers,
the
order
before
the
court
in
that
case,
it
was
a
statute,
but
i
am
drawing
an
analogy,
did
not
mandate
on
the
premises
parochial
school
instruction
so
that
issue
was
not
yet
presented
and
that
if
on
remand,
missouri
and
its
state
agencies
chose
to
up
for
that
form
of
instruction.
mr.
justice
blackmun
said,
the
range
of
possibilities
was
still
very
broad
and
the
first
amendment
implications
of
such
a
plan
would
vary
depending
on
what
was
adopted.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
that
is
correct.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
i
think
that
emphasizes
the
prematurity.
indeed
the
second
point
which
i
have
not
yet
had
the
opportunity
to
tell
your
honors
about
was
precisely
this,
that
the
issue
of
a
remedial
decree
that
embraced,
if
it
did
and
we
do
not
know
whether
it
would
or
not,
but
that
embraced
local
housing
authorities,
is
premature
at
this
point
because
we
do
not
have
the
shape
of
that
decree
before
us,
let
alone
knowing
for
sure
that
such
a
decree
will
be
entered.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
i
do
your
honor
and
i
must
say
with
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
i
am
not
here
defending
that
opinion
per
se.
a
remand,
i
am
defending
the
result.
i
think
the
result
is
sound,
but
i
think
the
language
is
overly
broad
and
this
court
knows.
a
remand
to
the
district
court
would
be
in
compliance
with
whatever
this
court
said
in
its
opinion,
not
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
i
think
that
on
remand,
with
the
proper
parties
added,
it
would
be
open
to
the
district
court
in
theory.
i
think
it
is
very
unlikely
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
reasons
i
will
come
to.
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
district
court
in
theory
to
decide
against
the
metropolitan
plan
and
i
do
not
think
without
having
joined
the
appropriate
parties
to
be
joined
and
having
heard
them,
a
final
determination
can
be
made
with
respect
to
that
matter
either.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
not
at
all
your
honor.
the
government’s
brief,
it
is
reply
memorandum
rather
makes
the
flat
out
statement
that
this
case
is
at
the
same
stage
that
milliken
was
when
this
court
granted
certiorari.
i
differ
with
that
view.
the
district
court
in
milliken,
before
this
court
took
the
case,
had
entered
a
plan
--
entered
an
order
which
provided
for
the
establishment
of
a
panel
of
nine
persons
to
formulate
a
desegregation
plan
and
it
had
laid
out
a
number
of
precise
respects
in
which
that
panel
was
to
operate.
it
talked
about
the
equalization
of
facilities
between
school
districts,
the
financial
arrangements
to
be
made
between
them
and
a
number
of
other
particulars.
and
only
after
it
was
clear
in
milliken,
as
a
result
of
the
entry
of
that
order,
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
in
some
particulars
that
essentially
affirmed
the
district
court's
basic
approach
in
dealing
with
those
matters
and
involving
the
local
district,
then
it
came
to
this
court.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
it
affirmed
and
approached,
but
with
a
clear
indication
that
in
--
it
was
a
long
court
of
appeals’
opinion
your
honor
will
recall,
in
a
number
of
specifics
that
the
district
court
had
indicated,
that
was
the
right
way
to
go.
now,
we
do
not
have
that
here.
we
do
not
have
anything
like
that
here.
we
have
not
even
heard
at
lower
court
levels
let
alone
at
this
court
level
from
the
parties
who
might
be
affected,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
even
clear
your
honor,
and
it
was
clear
in
milliken,
it
is
not
even
clear
here,
that
the
district
court
would
enter
an
order
that
would
involve
local
housing
authorities
at
all.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
out
of
chicago,
it
would
not
involve
them
at
all.
i
wish
--
mr.
alexander
polikoff
the
court
of
appeals
was
talking
your
honor,
about
the
desirability
on
the
record
made
in
this
case
of
area
wide,
but
not
multi
district
relief.
in
milliken,
this
court
spoke
not
merely
of
area
wide
relief
in
a
geographic
sense,
but
of
area
wide
multi
district
relief.
that
is
a
quotation
i
believe
from
phrase
that
appears
in
mr.
chief
justice
burger’s
opinion
in
milliken
and
what
that
phrase
meant
in
milliken
was
that
the
relief
envisioned
by
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
necessarily
involved,
what
your
honor
called
included
dtistricts.
decrees
that
ran
--
a
decree
that
ran
against
local
governmental
entities,
discreet
autonomous
units
and
required
them
to
do
something
they
were
decreedal
parties.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals'
direction
to
be
metropolitan
area
wide
in
scope
need
not
involve
the
decreedal
provisions
that
require
the
inclusion
of
additional
parties.
my
very
first
point,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
early
question,
was
it
one
invisionable,
there
is
such
a
word,
one
invisionable
form
of
relief
in
this
case
is
a
decree
confined
to
hud
that
does
not
decreedly
run
against
anybody
else
that
tells
hud
to
utilize
what
it
already
utilizes
administratively,
a
housing
market
area
unit
for
administering
the
stream
of
federal
subsidy
funds
flowing
into
the
chicago
area
that
is
in
the
past
caused
discrimination
and
in
the
future
ought
to
be
used
to
remedy
it.
now,
that
flow
of
federal
funds,
hud
administers
on
an
area
wide
basis,
not
an
area
wide
multi-district
basis
as
in
milliken,
but
an
area
wide
basis,
it
compares
competing
proposals
for
the
use
of
those
funds
that
come
to
it
from
within
that
area.
now,
why
does
it
choose
such
an
area?
it
does
so
because
hud’s
regulations
say
that
in
the
real
world,
housing
is
not
like
schools.
children
are
assigned
to
schools
within
a
discreet
geographic
area
and
they
have
to
go
there,
they
cannot
go
anywhere
else
if
they
live
within
that
area.
hud
says
that
by
contrast
in
the
housing
situation,
people
look
for
housing
in
terms
of
how
far
they
are
from
jobs,
commuting
distances,
what
the
market
for
housing
is
as
determined
by
hud
to
be
a
specific
geographic
area
that
crosses
the
boundary
lines
of
local
political
jurisdiction.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
we
insist
that
they
should
and
i
have
been
agreeing
with
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
should
have
been
the
procedure
followed.
it
was
the
procedure
we
requested
the
district
court
to
follow.
it
was
aborted
because
the
district
court
denied
our
motion
to
that
effect.
and
indeed,
the
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
appeal
not
from
the
entire
judgment
order
entered
by
the
district
court,
but
only
from
that
portion
of
the
order
that
denied
the
motion
you
and
i
have
just
been
talking
about.
the
rest
of
the
judgment
order
was
the
general
summary
judgment
against
hud.
we
did
not
appeal
from
that.
hud
filed
a
cross
appeal
from
that
portion
of
the
order
and
later
abandoned
it
and
rightly
so
because
it
was
the
order
they
themselves
had
proposed.
the
second
aspect
of
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
implied
as
i
understood
it
that
there
might
be
something
inequitable
even
about
an
indirect
involvement
of
the
local
housing
authorities
since
they
were
not
involved
in
the
wrong,
i
am
assuming
for
this
purpose
that
the
wrong
is
viewed
as
being
limited
to
chicago,
we
make
that
is
not
so
also.
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
show
that
in
the
administration
of
federal
programs,
federal
courts
have
a
number
of
times
in
food
stamp
cases
and
employments
services
cases
confined
relief
to
the
federal
administering
agency
in
connection
with
the
joint
federally,
locally
administered
program.
the
courts
have
said
that
is
proper.
the
indirect
impact
on
the
state
is
something
that
is
mandated
by
federal
law,
but
even
beyond
that,
the
major
current
form
of
federally
subsidized
housing
activities
does
not
necessarily
involve
local
housing
authorities
at
all.
hud’s
current
program
is
primarily
a
private
developer
program,
not
a
local
housing
authority
program.
hud’s
dealings
are
primarily
with
private
developers
and
with
respect
of
that
kind
of
flow
of
federally
subsidized
activities,
the
local
jurisdictional
boundary
lines
are
completely
irrelevant.
housing
authorities
may,
but
need
not
enter
into
the
program.
it
is
a
matter
of
their
own
voluntary
choice.
in
sum,
there
are
two
alternatives
it
seems
to
me.
one
is
to
dismiss
the
writ
that
is
improvidently
granted
because
the
whole
thing
appears
premature.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
correct.
i
do.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
the
second
alternative
and
in
my
view
by
far
the
preferable
one
because
this
has
been
a
long
lasting
litigation
and
clarity
is
desirable.
the
second
would
be
to
recognize
the
force
as
i
see
it
and
i
hope
you
do
if
i
point
number
1
that
on
any
view
giving
the
most
weight
and
strength
to
the
milliken
considerations
on
any
view,
a
decree
limited
to
hud
not
running
against
the
local
housing
authorities
or
other
governmental
entities
would
be
an
appropriate
order
in
this
case
and
would
not
be
inter-district
under
milliken.
now,
on
that
view
the
court
of
appeals
judgment,
not
its
opinion
of
course,
but
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
could
be
affirmed
because
all
that
judgment
does
is
--
mr.
alexander
polikoff
with
limitation
that
i
--
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
a
limitation
as
to
an
appropriate
order
that
might
be
entered
by
the
district
court,
but
the
district
court
would
not
be
confined
to
that.
the
other
possibilities
in
light
of
the
procedural
corrections
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
have
been
talking
about
having
been
made,
the
district
court
could
then
consider
whether
or
not
and
i
am
not
predicting,
whether
or
not
relief
extending
beyond
hud
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
pardon
me?
mr.
alexander
polikoff
that
is
correct.
we
think
that
the
next
step
and
indeed
what
we
asked
for
in
our
motion
below
that
was
denied
was
the
holding
hearing.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
the
district
court
would
not
in
our
judgment
be
free
to
say
that
soundly
and
correctly
because
as
i
have
indicated
it
is
my
first
and
principal
point
here
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
that
an
order
confined
to
hud,
even
though
it
extended
area
wide
to
the
housing
market
area,
but
did
not
involve
other
parties
would
not
be
an
inter-district
order
under
milliken.
the
--
mr.
alexander
polikoff
not
quite
that
way.
we
have
an
order
in
chicago
your
honor,
to
illustrate
and
i
am
not
--
i
am
answering
your
question
in
terms
of
what
district
court
might
do,
what
one
of
the
options
would
be,
we
have
an
order
in
chicago
that
essentially
imposes
two
requirements
on
hud.
it
says
that
the
federal
housing
subsidy
funds,
henceforth
flowing
into
chicago
should
meet
two
criterion
if
they
are
to
be
used
in
chicago,
in
addition
to
all
of
the
other
criterion
and
those
two
criteria
are
first
the
predominance
in
white
resident
black
neighborhoods
and
second,
availability
of
some
of
the
housing
to
the
plaintiff
class.
now,
to
answer
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
exactly
those
two
criterion
could
be
directed
by
the
district
court
to
be
used
by
hud
in
the
area
hud
already
uses
to
administer
these
programs
that
would
not
involve
other
parties,
that
would
not
in
our
view,
therefore,
be
an
inter-district
order
under
milliken
and
the
district
court
would
not,
therefore,
be
prohibited
by
milliken
from
entering
such
an
area
wide
order
against
hud.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
the
authority,
i
would
say
the
duty
stems
from
the
adjudication
of
liability
against
hud.
the
federal
executive
branch
is
obligated
to
remedy
its
constitutional
and
statutory
wrongs
just
as
much
as
state
and
local
governments
are
and
cases
without
number
have
imposed
restrictions
and
limitations
on
federal
agencies
requiring
them
to
remedy
their
own
wrongs.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
the
solicitor
general
emphasizes
and
properly
so
that
hud’s
wrong
was
in
a
sense
secondary
because
it
consisted
of
funding
and
approving
actions
of
another
agency,
but
we
insist
and
i
think
also
correctly
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
finding
that
hud’s
activities,
although
understandable
were
nonetheless
an
independent
basis
of
wrongdoing
and
violated
both
the
constitution
and
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
that
is
correct
your
honor.
in
our
view
housing
market
areas
or
relief
against
hud
would
not
be
dependent
upon
such
a
factual
hearing
because
the
chicago,
the
city
of
chicago
is
located
within
the
chicago
housing
market
area,
an
administrative
area
that
hud
defines
and
uses
as
the
appropriate
area
for
a
number
of
purposes,
particularly
and
specifically
including
and
i
am
now
quoting
from
a
hud
regulation
“decreasing
the
effects
of
past
housing
discrimination.”
mr.
alexander
polikoff
i
think
not.
it
is
important
to
distinguish
between
what
is
necessary
to
demonstrate
at
the
liability
stage
of
the
case
and
what
is
appropriate
for
an
equity
court
to
consider
at
the
remedial
stage
of
a
case.
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
and
i
am
not
arguing
here,
i
am
certainly
not
waiving
and
i
will
come
to
it
shortly
if
there
is
time,
but
if
we
assume
of
this
suburban
discrimination
aspect
of
the
case,
but
if
we
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
wrongs
were
confined
to
the
city
of
chicago,
nonetheless
residents
of
the
city
of
chicago
seek
housing
as
hud
itself
says,
not
within
the
boundaries
of
the
city
of
chicago,
but
within
the
housing
market
area.
they
seek
it
throughout
that
entire
area.
hud
constantly
administers
its
programs
with
respect
to
that
broader
area.
now,
liability
having
been
established
on
the
part
of
hud
admittedly
by
assumption
for
our
purposes
here
at
the
moment
within
the
city
of
chicago,
it
is
incumbent
upon
hud
and
it
is
incumbent
by
an
equity
court
to
direct
hud
to
provide
the
fullest
possible,
the
most
effective
relief
that
may
be
attainable
with
respect
to
the
wrongs
it
has
committed
in
chicago.
now,
why
implied
in
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
should
hud
in
doing
that
go
beyond
the
city
of
chicago’s
corporate
boundary
limits.
well,
the
answer
is,
unlike
the
situations
with
schools,
housing
is
sought
by
the
persons
in
chicago,
including
the
wrong
persons
within
the
housing
market
area.
it
is,
therefore,
possible
for
hud
to
provide
relief
for
those
persons
in
accordance
with
its
normal
administrative
activities
as
indicated
by
its
own
regulations
in
what
is
a
realistic
geographic
area
with
respect
to
housing.
it
would
not
be
with
respect
to
schools.
it
is
true
that
the
nature
of
the
wrong
determines
the
scope
of
the
remedy,
but
the
nature
of
the
wrong
in
this
case
is
not
a
school’s
wrong,
it
is
the
housing
wrong
and
the
nature
of
the
universe
of
housing
is
that
we
deal
with
market
areas,
we
do
not
deal
with
identifiable
and
confined
geographic
units
called
school
districts
and
the
nature
of
the
housing
wrong
in
this
case
not
only
justifies,
but
compels
the
equitable
relief
of
using
the
housing
market
area
as
the
remedial
geography.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
both,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
and
the
political
unit
that
is
relevant
with
respect
to
hud
is
of
course
the
entity,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
which
has
chosen
an
administrative
area
that
expands
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
local
housing
authorities
who
may
not
even
be
participants
at
all
in
a
part
of
the
remedial
scheme
we
are
talking
about.
one
of
the
anomaly
--
mr.
alexander
polikoff
that
is
correct.
not
being
exercised,
it
had
a
potential
for
late
in
power
to
compel
the
consolidation
of
local
school
districts
in
that
case.
here
we
do
not
have
a
potential
or
late
empower
on
the
part
of
hud
to
compel
anybody
to
do
anything.
we
are
not
talking
about
compelling.
we
are
talking
about
an
order
confined
to
hud.
that
is
a
practical
option
to
the
district
court
that
would
not
compel
anybody
other
than
hud
to
do
anything.
there
would
of
course
be
indirect
impacts
on
housing
developers,
private
developers,
as
well
as
public
developers
who
chose
voluntarily
to
apply
for
the
housing,
but
those
indirect
impacts
are
no
ground
for
refusing
or
denying
the
relief
against
hud
that
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
as
a
remedial
matter.
i
guess
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
mr.
alexander
polikoff
i
think
i
would
mr.
chief
justice,
in
fact
i
think
that
to
be
consistent
