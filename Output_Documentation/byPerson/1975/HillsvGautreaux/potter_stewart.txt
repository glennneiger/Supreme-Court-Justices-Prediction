with
that
geographical
restriction,
if
any?
justice

that
was
within
a
--
given
metropolitan
community
or
--?
justice

stewart
does
robbins
have
its
own

authority?
justice
stewart
in
this
respect
is
this
not
case
and
very
much
the
same
posture
that
the
milliken
case
was
when
it
came
here?
justice
stewart
it
was
affirmed
and
approached
though?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
mean
--
you
mean
out
of
chicago?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
an
affirmance
in
that
you
think
we
ought
to
agree
that
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
to
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
the
school
districts
are
geographic
units,
they
were
politically
units?
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
to
you
have
political
units?
justice
potter
stewart
in
milliken,
you
have
the
state
of
michigan
with
an
overall
regional
educational
policy
and
powers?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
united
states
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
known
as
hud
or
sometimes
as
hud,
has
been
judicially
found
to
have
violated
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
in
connection
with
the
selection
of
sites
for
public
housing
in
the
city
of
chicago.
the
issue
now
before
us
is
whether
the
remedial
order
of
the
federal
trial
court
may
extend
beyond
chicago’s
territorial
boundaries.
the
district
court
confined
the
operation
of
its
decree
to
the
chicago
city
limits,
but
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
order
and
remanded
the
case,
so
that
the
district
court
could
consider
a
broader
decree
covering
the
entire
metropolitan
area.
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
hud,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
view
of
this
court’s
decision
two
terms
ago
in
the
case
of
milliken
against
bradley,
which
held
that
a
judicial
decree
to
remedy
an
unconstitutionally
segregated
school
system
in
the
city
of
detroit
must
be
confined
to
the
territorial
boundaries
of
that
school
district.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
milliken
decision
to
suggest
a
per
se
rule
that
federal
courts
lack
authority
to
order
a
person
found
to
have
violated
the
constitution
to
undertake
remedial
efforts
beyond
the
municipal
boundaries
of
the
city
where
the
violation
occurred.
the
proposed
remedy
in
the
milliken
case
was
held
to
be
impermissible
because
of
the
limits
on
federal
judicial
power
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
political
entities
that
were
not
implicated
with
unconstitutional
conduct.
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
a
judicial
order
directing
relief
beyond
the
boundary
lines
of
chicago
will
not
necessarily
entail
coercion
of
uninvolved
governmental
units.
our
prior
decisions
counsel
that
in
the
event
of
a
constitutional
violation,
all
reasonable
methods
must
be
available
to
formulate
an
effective
remedy,
and
that
every
effort
should
be
made
by
a
federal
court
to
employ
those
methods
to
achieve
the
greatest
possible
degree
of
relief.
in
this
case
it
is
entirely
appropriate
and
wholly
consistent
with
the
milliken
decision
to
order
hud
to
attempt
to
create
housing
alternatives
for
the
respondents
in
the
chicago
suburbs.
the
wrong
committed
by
hud
confined
the
respondents
to
segregated
public
housing.
the
relevant
geographic
area,
for
purposes
of
the
respondents’
housing
options,
is
the
chicago
are
housing
market,
not
the
chicago
city
limits.
to
foreclose
such
relief,
solely
on
the
ground
that
hud’s
constitutional
and
statutory
violations,
took
place
within
the
city
limits
of
chicago,
would
transform
the
milliken
decision
into
an
arbitrary
and
mechanical
shield
for
those
found
to
have
engaged
in
unconstitutional
conduct.
for
the
reasons
i
have
summarized
which
are
discussed
in
some
detail
in
the
court’s
written
opinion,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
concurring
statement,
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
have
joined,
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
