justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
they
defrauded
the
government
the
defrauded
model
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
would
not
have
to
be
based
on
contract
well
is
suppose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
before
the
discovery
of
the
fraud,
what
if
the
day
after
they
sent
the
stuff,
they
simply
had
a
change
of
heart,
and
before
the
government
ever
discovered
the
fraud
they
sent
single
damages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
liability
for
double-damages
becomes
fixed
when
they
cause
to
be
submitted
to
the
government,
the
false--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
if
model
had
discovered
the
fraud
and
refused
to
submit
the
invoices
to
the
government,
then
although
the
respondents’
fraud
was
complete
they
never
would
have
been
become
liable
to
the
government.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
your
brief
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
certainly
caused
to
be
presented
a
claim
to
the
government,
under
the
rs
5438
that
you
have
set
forth
at
pages
four
and
five
of
your
brief,
did
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
the
language
caused
to
be
presented?
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
do
not
read
5438,
if
you
look
at
the
top
of
page
five
perhaps,
i
have
missed
something
that
you
have
seen,
look
at
the
top
of
page
five
of
your
brief,
any
claim
upon
or
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
officer
there
of
knowing
such
claim
to
be
false,
fictitious
or
fraudulent.
now
that
just
says
claim,
it
does
not
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
act
prohibited
is
causing
to
be
submitted
a
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing,
i
am
hurt
in
an
automobile
accident
and
i
incurred
$2,000.00
hospital
bills,
and
as
approximate
result
of
the
negligence
of
the
driver
at
the
other
car.
now,
if
i
have
hospital
insurance
that
pays
me
offer
that
right
away,
you
would
not
say
that
none
of
that—i
never
would
sustained
those
damages
would
you,
in
dealing
with
the
tortfeasor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
as
a
matter
of
principle,
i
would
think
you
would
extend
proximate
cause
further
when
you
are
dealing
with
someone
who
defrauds
than
with
someone
who
is
merely
negligent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
that
is
an
argument
on
the
forfeitures
point,
but
you
are
making
an
argument
on
the
double-damages
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
should
just
look
though
to
the
act
of
the
subcontractors
as
your
opponents
are
suggesting,
and
say
that
what
is
forbidden
by
rs
3490
is
the
doing
or
committing
of
the
act,
the
subcontractor's
act
is
single
in
submitting
the
thing
to
the
prime.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
how
many
times
do
the
subcontractor
in
this
case
cause
a
false
claim
to
be
submitted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
you
could
argue
equally
well
that
it
did
it
once.
