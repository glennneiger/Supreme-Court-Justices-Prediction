mr.
jack
ballan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
not
wish
to
be
repetitive.
i
hope
you
will
bear
with
me
if
i
am.
i
would
like
to
just
emphasize
a
few
points
that
perhaps
have
also
been
mentioned
before.
one
is
that
this
statute
ambiguous,
and
indeed
the
last
paragraph
of
the
circuit
court’s
opinion
indicates,
when
it
cries
out
for
interpretation
or
revision
and
perhaps
that
is
why
we
are
here.
and
i
raise
this
because
i
think
that
the
court’s
have
been
struggling
with
this
ambiguity
and
these
ambiguities
and
these
overlapping
sections,
and
have
come
up
with
reasonable
guidelines,
not
sufficient
admittedly
but
reasonable
guidelines
to
date.
and
may
i
say
that
in
each
case
that
i
have
read
i
can
find
no
exception.
there
has
been
a
minimization
of
claims
from
the
subcontractor
through
the
contractor.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
only
case
that
i
know
off
and
i
stand
to
be
corrected
if
i
am
wrong,
where
the
acts
of
the
subcontractor
have
been
maximized
rather
than
reversed.
even
in
the
ueber
case,
which
is
very
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
government,
there
were
442
false
invoices
submitted
to
the
general
contractor
--
by
the
two
general
contractors
by
the
subcontractor,
they
were
reduced
to
54.
and
it
makes
it
clear
in
this
case
that
there
was
a
pass
through
that
these
invoices
that
were
ultimately
submitted
arouse
out
of
truly
arouse
out
of
it
and
truly
were
caused
by
the
acts
of
the
subcontractor.
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
we
did
not
truly
cause
the
35
claims
to
be
filed.
we
did
cause
claims
to
be
filed
but
not
35,
and
as
i
think
mr.
justice
powell
indicated
the
government
could
have
got
to
500
in
this
instances,
if
it
wished
to,
it
could
look
for
all
types
of
false
documents
and
include
them
in
their
false
claims.
but
this
would
be
a
gross
injustice,
i
think
and
it
would
be
a
misreading
of
the
statue
which
admittedly
has
some
problems.
now,
i
think
it
is
fair
then
to
say
that
the
subcontractor
here
should
be
charged
with
his
acts,
and
not
the
fortuitous
acts
of
the
general
contractor,
which
are
as
has
been
said
before,
totally
beyond
his
control.
now
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
indicated
some
concern
about
deterrence
as
we
are
and
we
are
not
here
to
defend
or
prove
certainly
of
what
was
done,
but
the
deterrence
does
in
fact
take
place
with
the
criminal
sanction,
which
was
imposed
and
can
always
be
imposed
by
the
statute
here
and
that
these
two
gentleman
received
a
two-year
jail
sentence
which
are
in
stipulations,
which
was
suspended,
and
as
businessmen
certainly
that
is
quite
a
serious
deterrent.
mr.
jack
ballan
i
think
you
are
right,
sir.
to
my
knowledge
very--
mr.
jack
ballan
well,
we
are
dealing
with
this
statute
and
how
it
has
been
interpreted,
the
government
--
the
petitioner
has
relied
heavily
on
marcus
and
hess,
which
is
the
only
supreme
court
decision
to
deal
with
the
question
of
multiple
forfeitures.
and
in
that
case
also,
there
was
a
reduction,
a
minimization
of-of
claims
and
of
penalties
or
forfeitures
because
the
court’s
have
been
struggling
with
this
ambiguous
statutes
and
have
been
in
each
instance
reducing
them
to
a
reasonable
level
and
a
reasonable
standard.
with
respect
to
the
double-damages,
may
i
just
say
that
in
this
instance,
the
statute
says
double-damages
sustained
are
to
be
charged
against
the
subcontractor,
these
two
individuals,
and
may
i
suggest
that
there
were
no
damages
at
all
in
this
case.
that
when
the
restitution
was
made,
when
the
payment
was
made
by
model,
the
contractor,
who
never
went
after
the
respondents
herein,
although
he
might
have
or
it
might
have.
when
that
payment
was
made
of
$18,000.00
to
the
government,
the
government
was
rendered
whole
financially
and
economically--
mr.
jack
ballan
no,
i
would
not
say
that,
i
would
agree
with
the
implication
of
your
question.
however
this
is
a
question
of
fraud
and
i
do
think
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
tort
action
or
a
negligence
action
that
the
approximate
causes
are
certainly
the
responsibility
of
the
original
tortfeasor.
but
in
this
instance,
with
a
fraudulent
claim,
with
fraud
being
charged
the
response
i
think
they
should
be
charged
only
and
i
think
the
statutes
and
the
cases
indicate
with
their
acts
of
fraud.
mr.
jack
ballan
well
sir,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
this
case
our
problem
is
that
the
upper
limits
of
that
are
totally
beyond
our
control
and
do
result
in
very
unfair
consequences.
for
example,
this
contract
with
which
we
were
subcontractors
was
a
two-million
dollar
contract.
there
were,
as
the
government
pointed
out,
about
five
or
six
component
parts
and
these
sets
that
were
sent
out,
we
provided
a
small
part
of
one
of
those
five
or
six
parts,
namely
two
tubes
for
each
unit.
now,
the
total
of
that
we
have
received
was
approximately
about
$13,000.00
or
$16,000.00
i
believe
was
what
we
received
in
payment.
now,
we
are
unable
to
control
the
ultimate
or
the
subsequent
subdivision
or
multiplication
by
the
general
contractor
when
he
submits
his
invoices--
mr.
jack
ballan
well
on
that,
i
making
a
statutory
argument,
sir,
and
i
am
referring
to
the
rationale
of
the
client
case,
which
is
the
only
circuit
court
decision
on
this
matter,
and
in
that
case,
they
read
the
statute,
which
does
not
provide
for
when
the
doubling
takes
place.
and
they
felt
that
a
rationale
approach
would
be
to
fix
the
amount
lost
if
there
is
restitution
made,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
to
then
subtract
the
difference
and
then
double
and
they
came
up
with
a
figure
indicating
that
there
was
really
no
loss
to
the
government,
it
was
miniscule.
if
model
had
not
made
restitution,
had
not
paid
$18,000,
then
we
certainly
would
have
been
held
accountable
for
a
doubling
of
a
loss
of
16,000
to
18,000
or
namely
32,000
to
36,000.
but
the
payment
was
made.
there
was
no
law
sustained
by
the
government
except
in
its
subsequent
prosecution
of
this
matter.
i
believe
that
the
rest
has
been
stated
by
my
colleague
and
i
will
probably
repeat
anything
unless
there
are
any
questions.
thank
you.
