mr.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
under
the
false
claims
act,
raises
out
of
respondent’s
fraudulent
supply
of
non-conforming
electron
tubes
for
use
in
army
radio
communications
kits.
the
facts
were
as
follows;
in
1962,
the
signal
supply
agency,
acting
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
the
army,
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
private
company,
model
engineering
and
manufacturing
corporation,
for
the
supply
of
radio
kit
sets.
each
set
was
to
contain
a
transmitter,
a
receiver,
a
power
supply,
transformer,
and
radio
accessory
kit.
a
radio
accessory
kits
operated
with
4x150g
electron
tubes,
the
contract
required
that
these
be
“jan”
branded.
“jan”,
j-a-n
is
an
acronym
standing
for
joint
army
navy.
the
manufacturer
is
authorized
to
use
the
jan
designation,
only
after
its
manufacturing
process
has
passed
certain
government
test
for
quality
control
and
the
tubes
themselves
pass
certain
government
inspection
tests.
thus
by
calling
for
jan
tubes
in
the
contract,
the
contract
in
effect
require
the
furnishing
of
tubes
that
were
certified
as
having
met
certain
government
standards
as
to
both
manufacture
and
performance.
the
requirement
of
jan
tubes
in
the
contract
can
therefore
be
seen
to
be
more
than
a
mere
technical
formality,
although
the
record
is
silent
on
this
point,
it
may
reasonably
be
inferred
that
the
radio
sets,
which
as
i
have
indicated,
included
both
receiver
and
transmitter
will
be
used
for
the
army
for
field
communications,
and
that
a
tube
failure
can
impair
the
military
operations
that
might
be
dependent
upon
such
communications.
the
rigid
quality
control
and
performance
standards,
represented
by
jan
branding,
is
therefore
served
to
minimize
the
risk
of
such
a
tube
failure.
this
consideration
i
believe,
indicates
the
practical
importance
of
the
contractual
requirement
that
the
tubes
to
be
supplied
would
be
jan
tubes,
and
it
also
underlines
the
seriousness
of
the
respondents’
fraud,
which
i
will
now
describe.
the
respondents
who
are
the
owners
and
operators
of
a
corporation,
united
national
labs,
that
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
prime
contractor,
model
engineering
for
the
supply
of
the
jan
tubes
called
for
by
the
contract.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case
that
the
respondents
caused
and
are
responsible
for
all
the
acts
of
their
corporation,
united
national
labs,
and
therefore
it
is
appropriate
in
further
describing
the
facts
in
this
case
to
raise
the
corporate
veil
and
talk
solely
in
terms
of
the
respondents’
individual
acts,
attributing
the
acts
of
the
corporation
to
the
respondents
as
well.
the
respondents
were
dealers
in
electron
tubes
and
they
entered
into
the
subcontract
with
model
engineering,
knowing
that
the
tubes
to
be
furnished
there
under
were
to
be
used
in
the
military
procurement
contract.
at
the
time,
they
entered
into
this
subcontract,
the
prevailing
market
price
for
jan
tubes
of
the
type
specified
in
the
contract
was
approximately
$40.00
per
tube.
instead
of
buying
and
supplying
these
kinds
of
tubes,
the
respondents
instead
bought
cheaper
tubes
at
prices
ranging
from
$15.00
to
$18.00
and
they
falsely
stamped
each
tube
with
a
jan
designation.
as
we
have
here
a
case
of
fraud,
pure
and
simple,
committed
solely
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
dishonest
profit.
the
respondents
made
three
shipments
of
a
total
of
397
falsely
branded
tubes,
the
tubes
were
packaged
in
21
separate
boxes,
and
each
box
was
accompanied
by
a
packing
list
to
which
the
respondents
have
fixed
a
false
government
inspection
stamp.
the
respondents
billed
model
engineering,
the
prime
contractor
for
the
tubes,
on
three
separate
invoices.
in
turn
model
engineering
incorporated
these
tubes
into
the
radio
kit
sets
that
it
supplied
to
the
army,
and
it
billed
the
army
for
the
tubes
on
35
separate
invoices
or
claims
for
payment.
each
of
these
claims
for
payment
represented
falsely
because
of
the
respondents’
fraud,
that
the
electron
tubes
furnished
in
the
radio
kit
sets
were
government
inspected
jan
tubes.
the
government
paid
these
35
claims
for
payment.
when
respondents’
fraud
was
subsequently
discovered
after
some
negotiation,
model
engineering,
the
prime
contractor,
paid
the
government
a
total
of
a
little
bit
more
than
$16,000.00
for
the
breach
of
contract
that
had
been
occasioned
by
the
respondents’
fraud.
mr.
jones
well
i
think
that
the
government
owed
model
monies
in
connection
with
some
other
contract
and
that
the
$16,000.00
odd
here
was
withheld
from
that
other
payment.
mr.
jones
well,
that
raises
two
questions,
one
of
contract
law
that
i
cannot
answer
because
these
respondents
are
individuals
and
i
do
not
know
whether
they
would
be
liable
in
contact
to
model
engineering,
it
was
their
corporation,
united
national
labs
that
actually
was
in
the
privative
contract
relation
with
model.
the
second
question
is
a
factual
one
and
i
simply
do
not
know
the
answer
to
it,
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
jones
yes
there
is
and
that
is
the
basis
for
the
government’s
concession
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
determining
double
damages
to
allow
a
certain
credit
for
the
payment
that
model
engineering
made,
i
will
get
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
in
a
moment.
mr.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
jones
the
respondents
is
individuals
themselves
might
be
liable
in
tort,
perhaps
that
is
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
at
any
rate,
under
the
theory
that
they
will
be
liable
in
one
form
or
another,
we
have
not
pressed
the
full
double
damages
liability
but
rather
have
indicated
that
some
kind
of
allowance
may
be
appropriate
on
account
model’s
payment
to
the
government.
mr.
jones
like
in
the
full
now
but
only
as
against
the
double
damages
that
had
to
be
competed--
mr.
jones
no
we
do
not
expect,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jones
well,
i
will
get
to
the
double-damages
aspect
to
the
case
in
a
moment.
now
first
i
would
like
to
layout
the
rest
of
the
facts
in
the--
mr.
jones
well,
i
certainly
hope
so.
a
trial
in
the
case,
the
district
court
determined
that
the
government’s
actual
injury
from
the
breach
of
contract
was
approximately
the
same
that
model
had
paid
to
the
government
that
are
$39.70
more.
the
district
court
further
determined
that
respondents
acts
in
supplying
the
falsely
stamped
tubes
thereby
causing
a
submission
of
false
claims
to
the
government
violated
the
false
claims
act,
and
the
respondents
have
not
contested
that
determination
either
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court.
the
issues
in
this
case
pertain
to
the
consequences
that
flowed
from
the
district
courts
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
false
claims
act.
there
are
two
issues;
one
concerns
the
question
of
whether
there
are
multiple
forfeitures
that
maybe
imposed
against
respondents
for
their
violation.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
respondents
here
are
subject
to
a
total
of
35
$2,000.00
forfeitures
under
the
act.
one
for
each
of
the
35
false
claims
for
payment
that
where
madders
has
resulted
to
their
fraud.
the
respondents’
assert
that
they
are
subject
to
only
one
forfeiture
payment
because
they
say
their
fraud
affected
only
one
subcontract,
and
that
is
how
they
would
measure
the
number
of
forfeitures
under
the
act,
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
respondents’
position.
mr.
jones
in
this
case
there
were
actually
8
government
vouchers
of
payment,
model
submitted
35
invoices
for
payment.
mr.
jones
yes,
that
is
apparently
what
took
place
in
this
case
and
i
do
not
know
over
what
course
of
time
the
various
claims
and
payments
were
made.
the
other
issue
in
the
case
is,
we
have
already
talk
about
a
little
bit,
is
the
question
of
the
proper
measurement
of
double-damages.
both
courts
below
sustained
the
respondents’
contention
that
the
government’s
single
damages
under
the
act
for
purposes
of
computing
double-damages,
is
limited
to
the
amount
of
the
government’s
injury
less
its
recoveries
from
the
prime
contractor.
accordingly,
the
courts
below
determined
single
damages
of
$39.70,
and
double
damages
of
$79.40.
our
position
on
this
issue
is
that
for
determining
single
damages
you
look
to
the
government’s
actual
injury
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
the
fraud,
to
get
double-damages,
you
double
that
amount.
the
government’s
injury
was
$16,000.00,
to
double
that
you
get
$32,000.00,
but
we
have
further
submitted
that
the
respondent
should
be
allowed
a
credit
against
that
$32,000.00
double-damages
liability
in
the
amount
of
the
recoveries
from
the
prime
contractor.
now
before
turning
to
an
analysis
of
these
two
separate
issues,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
combined
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
on
these
issues
taken
as
a
whole,
and
that
effect
we
feel
is
to
eviscerate
the
false
claims
act
as
the
deterrent
to
subcontractor
fraud.
the
court
imposed
upon
the
respondents
in
this
case
a
poultry
penalty
of
only
$2,079.40,
and
that
penalty
--
penalty
imposed
by
the
court
of
appeals
permits
the
respondents
to
retain
over
three-quarters
of
the
illegal
gain
that
they
made
on
by
supplying
the
government
with
cheap
tubes
rather
than
the
jan
tubes
required
by
the
contract.
and
we
submit
that
the
puny
threat
of
such
disproportionately
small
penalty
is
unlikely
to
deter
any
subcontractor
from
attempting
to
defraud
the
government.
if
the
fraud
goes
undetected,
the
subcontractor
reaps
a
dishonest
profit
and
pays
no
penalty
whatsoever.
if
on
the
other
hand,
as
in
this
case
the
fraud
is
discovered,
the
subcontractor
nevertheless
pays
back
to
the
government
only
a
small
of
fraction
of
the
dishonest
profit
on
the
illegal
gain.
mr.
jones
there
is
some
deterrents
on
the
criminal
side,
it
was
not
terribly
effective
in
this
case.
mr.
jones
yes,
but
what
we
are
now
talking
about
is
placing
at
least
a
substantial
deterrence
once
there
is
a
discovery.
i
would
further
point
out
that
although
these
respondents
were
prosecuted
and
convicted
of
a
conspiracy,
apparently,
there
is
no
criminal
statute,
which
by
its
terms
would
prohibit
the
substantive
act
of
causing
a
false
claim
to
be
made.
if
you
look
at
18
u.s.c
287,
it
punishes
the
making
of
false
claims.
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case
with
regard
to
contractors
is
causing
a
third
party
to
make
false
claims.
mr.
jones
well,
i
do
not
know
if
you
can
be
an
aider
and
abettor,
if
there
is
no
substantive
crime
by
another
person,
and
there
would
be
no
substantive
crime
by
the
prime
contractor
because
he
unknowingly
made
a
submission
of
false
claims.
not
saying
there
is
no
possible
criminal
punishment
other
than
under
a
conspiracy
clause,
but
i
am
just
pointing
out
that
the
criminal
and
the
civil
statutes
are
not
coterminous,
that
is
by
no
means
positive
that
you
can
always
punish
criminally
the
kinds
of
act
that
we
are
now
trying
to
impose
a
civil
penalty
on.
to
summarize
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
our
view
converted
the
false
claims
act
into
little
than
an
inexpensive
license
to
defraud
the
government.
license
moreover,
so
i
have
just
indicated,
that
must
be
paid
for
only
if
the
fraud
is
discovered,
and
we
believe
congress
could
not
and
did
not
intend
that
result.
indeed
as
i
know,
hope
to
show,
congress
intended
a
very
different
result
indeed.
i
begin
for
purposes
of
convenience
of
exposition,
with
the
question
of
double
damages,
because
i
have
one
important
thought
to
add
to
what
we
said
in
our
brief
on
that
issue,
and
i
would
like
to
address
at
the
outset.
respondents’
contention
here
is
that
the
prime
contractors
payment
to
the
government
of
a
single
contract
damages,
in
effect
absolves
the
respondents
from
any
liability
under
the
false
claims
act
double-damages
provision.
and
this
contention
can
fairly
be
tested
i
think,
by
asking
what
would
the
consequences
have
been,
if
the
single
contract
damage
as
payment
have
been
made
not
by
the
prime
contractor
but
by
the
respondents
themselves.
could
respondents
have
insulated
themselves
from
any
liability
for
double-damages,
by
coming
forward
after
the
discovery
of
the
fraud,
merely
with
the
payment
of
single
damages?
mr.
jones
well
i
would
think
that
from
a
purely,
trialling
logical
reading
of
the
act,
that
double-damages
would
have
in
fact
been
--
the
liability
for
double
damages
would
in
fact
have
been
incurred
as
of
the
date
of
the
fraud.
but
there
might
be
a
question
of
whether
had
there
been
a
payment
the
next
day,
that
had
actually
been
an
injury
to
the
government.
mr.
jones
well
that
is,
well,
the
violation
of
the
act
has
become
complete
at
that
point.
mr.
jones
well
that
is
exactly
our
point.
the
respondents
seem
to
think
that-that
they
or
the
prime
contractor
can
come
in
after
the
fraud
has
been
discovered
and
after
the
injury
has
already
been
sustained
and
reduced
their
liability
under
the
double-damages
provision
of
the
act,
from
double-damages
to
single
damages
merely
by
coming
forward
voluntarily
with
the
payment.
but
that
is
clearly
not
the
case,
respondents
could
not
have
escaped
their
own
liability
for
double
damages
simply
by
offering
single
damages.
mr.
jones
well
in
that
case,
there
might
not
have
even
been
a
violation
of
the
false
claims
act.
mr.
jones
it
would
not
have
caused
the
submission
of
a
false
a
claim
and
there
would
have
been
no
injury
to
the
government
for
purposes
of
the
double-damages
provision
either.
well,
we
believe
that
this
analysis
that
i
have
just
gone
through,
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
not
set
forward
with
any
clarity
on
our
brief,
is
dispositive
of
respondents
double-damages
claim
in
this
case.
i
would
recommend
to
the
court
the
reading
of
our
brief
for
further
arguments
on
this
point,
but
i
would
like
to
turn
for
the
remainder
of
my
argument
to
the
question
of
multiple
forfeitures.
the
first
clause
of
the
false
claims
act,
which
is
the
relevant
clause
in
this
case,
provides,
and
i
quote
with
some
deletions,
none
of
which
i
hope
change
the
substance.
any
person
who
shall
make
or
cause
to
be
made
any
claim
upon
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
officer
thereof,
knowing
such
claim
to
be
false,
shall
forfeit
and
pay
to
the
united
states
the
sum
of
$2,000.00.
as
well,
as
established
as
to
prime
contractors,
this
language
imposes
a
separate
$2,000.00
forfeiture
for
each
false
claim
for
payment.
since
the
act
imposes
a
forfeiture
on
any
false
claim
the
statutory
volition
is
complete
upon
the
presentation
of
the
first
false
claim,
and
a
forfeiture
arises
on
account
of
that
violation.
each
additional
false
claim
constitutes
a
separate
and
complete
violation
of
the
act
that
gives
rise
to
an
additional
forfeiture.
as
a
prime
contractor,
who
for
example
knowingly
submitted
35
false
claims
for
payment
to
the
government,
unquestionably
would
be
liable
for
35
separate
forfeitures.
we
believe
that
the
same
reading
of
the
act
before
supplies
to
subcontractor
fraud.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
established
by
this
court’s
opinion
in
united
states
exrel.
marcus
against
hess,
that
a
subcontractor
violates
the
act
when
its
fraud
causes
the
prime
contractor
to
submit
a
false
claim
for
payment
to
the
government.
the
subcontractor’s
violation
is
complete
when
the
prime
contractor
submits
its
first
false
claim
and
a
forfeiture
arises
at
that
time.
every
additional
submission
of
a
false
claim
is
a
separate
and
complete
violation
of
the
act
that
gives
rise
to
an
additional
forfeiture.
in
short,
the
plain
language
of
the
act
requires
the
number
of
forfeitures
to
be
determined
in
the
same
fashion,
whether
the
fraud
originates
with
the
prime
contractor,
or
as
in
this
case,
the
subcontractor.
this
we
believe
to
be
as
sensible
and
natural
result,
because
after
all
the
government’s
injury
is
the
same
whether
the
fraud
originates
with
the
contractor
or
the
subcontractor,
the
need
for
deterrence
is
the
same,
whether
the
fraud
originates
with
the
contractor
or
the
subcontractor,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
these
two
cases.
the
respondents’
argument
moreover,
which
is
that
you
measure
the
subcontractor’s
forfeitures
by
the
number
of
subcontracts,
has
utterly
no
basis
in
this
statutory
text,
which
has
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
act
that
produces
that
result.
and
not
only
is
our
results
supported
by
the
statutory
text,
serves
the
twin
purposes
of
deterrence
and
restitution
that
underlie
the
act.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
and
i
would
not
repeat
those
arguments
here,
there
will
be
a
mockery
of
the
legislative
intent
to
lump,
as
respondents
would
have
this
court
do,
all
the
subcontractors
fraudulent
practices
and
their
elections
into
a
single
statutory
violation.
now,
this
more
or
less
furnishes
the
court
with
our
affirmative
presentation
on
this
issue,
i
will
address
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
two
threads
of
argument
that
the
respondents
present
here.
one
appears
to
be
that
the
false
claims
act
should
be
narrowly
construed
in
the
manner
of
criminal
statute.
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
kind
of
narrow
construction
they
would
intend
since
there
is
no
apparent
basis
in
the
language
of
the
act
for
their
result
anyway.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
court
has
already
rejected
the
principle
of
construction
upon
which
they
rely.
in
the
united
states
ex
rel.
marcus
against
hess,
the
court
held
that
the
forfeiture
provisions
of
the
act
imposes
civil
not
a
criminal
sanction,
and
perhaps
more
to
the
point
in
united
states
against
neifert-white
co.
the
court
stated,
and
i
quote,
in
the
various
context
in
which
questions
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
act
have
been
presented.
the
court
has
consistently
refused
to
accept
a
rigid
restrictive
reading,
even
in
the
time
when
the
statute
imposed
criminal
sanctions
as
well
as
civil.
the
statute
no
longer
imposes
any
criminal
sanctions.
it
is
a
wholly
civil
statute
that
should
be
liberally
construed
in
a
manner
that
will
effectuate
its
underlying
purposes
of
deterrence
and
restitution.
respondents’
argument
appears
to
be
that
although
35
false
claims
for
payment
were
presented
to
the
government
in
this
case,
they
nevertheless
have
committed
only
a
single
causative
act,
a
single
act
of
causation
deserving
of
a
penalty.
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
basis
the
respondents’
have
for
making
that
suggestion.
in
the
first
place
it
is
clear
that
they
have
committed
many
separate
fraudulent
acts,
they
falsely
stamped
each
of
397
electron
tubes,
they
falsely
have
fixed
government--
false
government
inspection
stamps
to
each
of
21
packing
list.
they
have
submitted
3
false
invoices
to
the
prime
contractor
and
they
made
false
oral
representations
to
the
contractor
as
well.
mr.
jones
well
i
think
the
suggestion
is
that
the
government
could
take
the
position
that
there
were
397
violations
of
the
act
as
a
consequence
of
the
false
stamping
of
each
of
the
397
tubes.
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
assume
that
the
stamping
of
the
tubes
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act
and
of
the
second
clause
of
the
act.
i
think
that
it
is
arguable
whether
the
government
would
be
able
to
prevail
the
cause,
the
categories
of
documents
with
respect
to
which
false
entries
are
punished
under
the
second
clause
of
the
act,
would
not
appear
to
include
the
tubes
--
mr.
jones
well
the
199
is
a
number
of
the
respondents’
drew
out
of
the
hat,
and
i
think
they
arrived
at
because
there
were
397
false
tubes
and
they
said
well,
each
radio
kit
set
contains
two
tubes
and
therefore
a
198
kit
sets
would
include
false
tubes.
no
one
on
the
government
side
has
ever
suggested
that
the
figure
199.
the
only
figures
that
i
can
run
through
them
are
35
false
claims
under
the
first
clause
of
the
act.
397
falsely
stamped
tubes
under
the
second
clause
of
the
act,
but
i
question
whether
you
could
find
a
violation
with
regard
to
that.
21
falsely
stamped
package
list,
and
that
probably
is
a
violation,
causing
the
government
to
issue--
under
2?
mr.
jones
under
2,
but
we
are--
mr.
jones
which
is
not
involved,
none
of
these
other
numbers
are
involved.
8
false
vouchers
issued
by
the
government,
also
under
the
second
clause,
and
1
conspiracy,
and
3
false
invoices
issued
to
the
prime
contractor.
but
we
are
just
the
taking
the
position
here
that
the
false
claim
submitted
in
violation
of
the
first
clause
without
regard
to
any
of
the
other
clauses
of
the
act,
constitute
a
basis
for
the
forfeitures.
we
would
say
that
the
respondents’
course
of
fraudulent
conduct,
whether
it
is
conceived
of
consisting
of
one
act
or
many,
nevertheless
cause
the
submission
of
the
35
false
claims,
and
it
is
the
number
of
false
claims
that
is
determinative
of
the
number
of
forfeitures
under
the
act.
mr.
jones
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
jones
well
we
might
not
have
seek
to
impose
500
penalties
but
as
a
reading
of
the
act--
mr.
jones
that
is
correct,
we
take
the
position
that
respondents
could
reasonably
have
anticipated
that
the
prime
contractor
might
submit
more
than
one
false
claim
for
payment
as
a
result
of
their
fraud.
more
generally,
our
position
is
that
when
a
subcontractor
seeks
to
defraud
the
government,
he
does
so
at
its
peril
and
at
the
anticipatable
risk
that
the
prime
contractor
will
submit
multiple
false
claims
as
a
result
of
the
fraud.
there
were
35
such
false
claims
filed
here,
we
think
35
forfeitures
should
be
imposed.
i
would
like
reserve--
mr.
jones
yes,
i
think--
mr.
jones
i
assume
that
is
right
when
you
have
a
contract
that
extends
over
a
long
period
of
time,
you
have
payments
during
that
time.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
wanted
to
address
myself
to
the
argument
that
there
is
some
difference
between
the
revised
statutes
and
the
false
claims
act,
as
codified
in
the
31
usc.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever
in
the
language
of
practical
effect.
in
either
case
you
look
to
determine
that
whether
there
was
a
false
claim.
if
so
you
ask,
did
the
subcontractor
cause
it?
if
so
there
was
a
violation,
then
in
this
case
you
look
to
the
second
false
claim,
did
the
subcontractor
cause
it?
yes
he
did
by
his
fraud.
that
is
th
second
violation.
mr.
jones
the
reason
i
think
that
that
is
inappropriate
analysis
is
that
the
doing
or
committing
such
act
refers
to
the
act
described
in
5438,
and
the
acts
described
in
the
5438
are
the
causing
of
false
claim
to
be
submitted.
mr.
jones
35.
mr.
jones
well,
he
argues
that
his
fraudulent
course
of
the
conduct
constituted
a
single
causative
act
or
that
is
that
essence
as
i
take
it
of
that
argument.
it
seems
me
that
that
is
wrong
for
two
reasons
which
inter-relate.
one
is
that
we
have
here
multiple
acts
if
you
are
focusing
upon
the
acts
of
the
respondent
we
have
isolated
some
400
odd
different
fraudulent
acts.
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
concerned
with
the
act
as
defined
in
the
statute,
that
act
is
to
cause
the
false
claim
and
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
look
to
determine
whether
a
false
claim
was
submitted
and
if
so
whether
there
was
act
or
acts
of
the
respondent
that
caused
that
submission
and
in
this
case,
each
one
of
the
false
claim
was--
the
submission
jof
each
one
of
the
false
claim
was
caused
by
the
respondent
within
the
intendment
i
take
it
of
section
5438.
thank
you.
