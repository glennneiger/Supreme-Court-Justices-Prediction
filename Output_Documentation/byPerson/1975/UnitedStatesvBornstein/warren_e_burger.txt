is
it
government
practice
from
the
accounting
side

require
a
separate

they
accumulate
them
and
then
pay
in
groups,
apparently.
chief
justice
warren
e.

one
of
the
reasons
for
submitting
frequent
claims
is
to
get
the
money
back
into
the
capital
of
the
performing
contractors,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
as
applied
to
this
case,
do
you
think
that
operates
as
much
of
a
deterrence
for
this
kind
of
corrupt
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
contractors?

ever
informant

involved
under
that?

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
congressâ€™
numerous
statutes
provided
these
kinds
of
deterrent
civil
penalties
in
very
large
amounts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
from
the
civil
penalty
being
much-much
greater
than
the
criminal
penalty.
