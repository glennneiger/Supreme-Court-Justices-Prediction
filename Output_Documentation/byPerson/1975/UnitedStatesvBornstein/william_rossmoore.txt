mr.
william
rossmoore
yes
sir,
may
i—mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
respondent
gerald
page
in
this
matter.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
dispute
as
to
the
facts,
with
one
exception,
that
is
mr.
jones’
statement
that
the
repayment
by
model
to
the
government
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
deduction
from
other
contractor
--
from
other
contracts
between
model
and
the
government.
i
think
the
documents
which
are
included
in
the
government’s
appendix
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
deduction
was
from
payments
due
under
this
very
same
contract.
i
pointed
out
the
numbers
involved
in
my
brief
on
pages
17
to
18,
and
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
that
you
will
see
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
comes
under
this
same
contract.
well,
addressing
myself
first
to
the
question
of
the
number
of
forfeitures,
mr.
jones
here
dealt
with
a
different
numbers
that
might
be
used,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government’s
position
from
the
beginning
of
this
litigation
has
not
been
at
all
consistent.
as
judge
gibbons
pointed
out
in
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
originally
the
government
based
its
claims
for
forfeitures,
not
at
all
on
vouchers
submitted
by
model
to
the
government
but
on
its
claim
that
the
respondents
submitted
30
invoices
to
model
and
it
asserted
30
forfeitures
on
that
basis.
the
shift
came
when
i
think
it
found
out
that
there
were
only
three
invoices
and
then
this
theory
came
in
that
the
respondents
were
now
liable
for
the
one
forfeiture
for
each
of
35
invoices
submitted
by
model
to
the
government,
plus
one
forfeiture
each
for
the
joint
act
of
misbranding
the
tubes,
one
forfeiture
for
the
combined
acts
of
submitting
21
packing
lists,
and
one
forfeiture
for
the
combined
acts
of
submitting
21
certificates,
a
total
of
38,
i
take
it
that
at
this
point
they
are
now
asking
only
for
35.
i
think
that
what
this
demonstrates
is
that
in
fact
the
act
as
the
government
reads
it
is
not
all
clear.
i
submit
however,
that
if
properly
read
the
act
is
clear
and
i
note
that
mr.
jones
in
reading
the
act
to
this
court
persisted
in
reading
from
the
codification
in
31
u.s
section
231.
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
is
not
the
correct
wording
of
the
act,
this
court
has
so
recognized
that
in
the
u.s.
ex
rel.
marcus
against
hess
case,
the
neifert-white,
the
rainwater
case,
and
other
cases.
if
you
read
the
act
as
it
is
actually
written,
i
think
that
you
will
find
--
mr.
william
rossmoore
that
is
on
pages
four
and
five
of
my
brief,
sir.
the
act
does
not
say
that
anyone
who
submits
a
false
claim
or
causes
the
--
pages
four
and
five,
mr.
justice
brennan.
anyone
who
--
does
not
say
that
anyone
who
causes
the
submission
of
a
false
claim
shall
forfeit
$2,000.00.
it
says
that
anyone
who
commits
any
of
the
acts
prohibited
by
the
prior
criminal
section,
that
was
section
5438,
shall
forfeit
$2,000.00.
now
one
of
the
acts
prohibited
by
section
5438
is
the
causing
to
be
made
of
a
false
claim.
but
the
forfeiture
is
imposed
by
the
statute
on
the
act
committed
by
the
respondent
or
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court.
it
is
not
impose
on
the
submission
of
one
or
more
false
claims,
as
long
as
the
respondent
caused
the
submission
of
a
false
claim
he
then
becomes
for
that
act
liable
for
one
$2,000.00
forfeiture.
and
i
think
that
whether
or
not
this
is
now
solely
a
civil
statute,
the
criminal
statute
having
been
absorbed
elsewhere.
it
was
written
as
a
criminal
statute
originally
and
the
language
which
was
quite
clear
that
forfeitures
were
to
be
only
to
be
imposed
for
acts
committed
by
the
person
charged
with
the
forfeiture.
and
i
think
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
have
stressed
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute,
the
correct
language
as
it
actually
exists
on
the
statute
books.
mr.
william
rossmoore
well,
the
deterrent
effect
as
it
works
out
in
this
case
may,
certainly
is
not
as
great
as
if
you
impose
35
forfeitures.
the
deterrent
affect
comes
from
the
criminal
statute
and
i
think
the
record
here
shows
that
these,
both
of
these
respondents
were
charged
criminally,
did
plead
guilty
and
were
sentenced.
now,
the
fact
that
they
were
not
deterred
previously,
that
is
true
of
both
any
deterrent
statute
and
any
criminal
statute.
they
could
have
gone
to
jail
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
they
could
have
been
fined,
i
think
it
is
$10,000.00,
this
being
a
first
offense,
those
penalties
were
not
visited
upon
them.
but
i
think
the
threat
of
the
criminal,
the
criminal
process,
the
threat
of
the
jail
term
would
certainly
be
a
much
greater
deterrent
than
the
possibility
of
fortuitous
imposition
of
fines.
mr.
william
rossmoore
nothing
at
all,
and
in
many
cases
it
so
works
out.
and
some
of
the
--
i
guess
even
in
the
hess
case,
the
criminal
penalty
is
actually
imposed
were
greater
than
--
would
have
been
imposed
have
the
defendant
there
been
prosecuted
criminally.
but
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
it
in
the
hess
case,
is
to
provide
restitution
for
the
government.
mr.
william
rossmoore
i
believe
that
is
all.
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
language
of
the
court
in
the
hess
case
so
states.
we
think
that
the
chief
purpose
of
the
statute
here
was
to
provide
restitution
to
the
government
of
money
taken
from
it
by
fraud,
and
that
the
device
of
double
damages
plus
a
specific
sum
was
chosen
to
make
sure
that
the
government
would
be
made
completely
whole.
now,
it
may
also
incidentally
have
a
deterrent
effect
and
somebody
who
is
starting
out
to
commit
a
fraud
might
examine,
sit
down
and
say,
well
gee,
if
do
this,
it
is
going
to
cost
me
seventy
thousand
dollars
or
a
hundred-thousand
dollars,
i
do
not
give
a
damn
about
the
criminal
penalty
but
i
am
not
going
to
subject
myself
to
that.
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
way
people
get
into
this
kind
of
situation,
i
think
as
the
record
shows
here,
these
respondents
actually
backed
into
it.
they
entered
into
a
contract
which
they
could
not
fulfill
and
then
they
have
found
out
that
the
way
they
could
fulfill
it
was
committing
the
fraud,
and
they
were
involved
not
in
considering
the
penalties
at
all,
they
certainly
were
not
considering
the
number
of
forfeitures.
they
certainly
committed
illegal
acts,
they
certainly
were
subject
to
the
criminal
penalties
and
they
are
subject
to
the
civil
penalties
that
this
statute
provides.
mr.
william
rossmoore
yes,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
the
question
is
are
they
to
be
charged
with
a
$2,000.00
forfeiture
for
each
act
then
committed
by
somebody
else
over
which
they
had
no
control.
mr.
william
rossmoore
yes,
but
the
witness
statute
says
as
anyone
who
commits
an
act
shall
be
fined
$2,000.00,
the
act
is
causing
to
be
presented
a
claim
or
claims.
mr.
william
rossmoore
that
is
right
mr.
justice,
but
if
the
section
3490
says
that
the
forfeiture
should
be
visited
upon
the
act
committed
by
the
respondent
not
by
the
--not
upon
the
claims
submitted.
the
act
causes
the
claim,
yes,
but
the
punishment
or
the
penalty
or
the
forfeiture
goes
against
the
act
committed.
mr.
william
rossmoore
that
is
right,
sir.
but
one
act
can
cause
the
submission
of
one
claim
or
a
hundred
claims
or
400
or
397
claims
in
this
particular
case.
and
perhaps
it
can
be
made
clear
that
government’s
argument
is
that
somehow
the
subcontractor
gets
off
easier
than
the
contractor
in
this
case,
because
if
the
contractor
himself
were
committing
the
fraud
he
submitted
35
claims.
well
that
is
true,
but
the
contractor
had
the
power
each
time
that
he
submitted
a
claim
and
let
us
assume
he
knew
he
were
submitting
a
false
claim
to
say
gee,
you
know
i
have
talked
to
my
lawyer
and
i
realized
i
am
going
to
be
in
trouble,
i
am
not
going
to
submit
anymore
of
these,
i
may
be
stuck
with
what
i
have
submitted
but
i
am
not
going
to
submit
anymore.
the
subcontractor
does
not
have
that
option,
he
is
done,
he
did
his
--
he
committed
his
fraud,
he
submitted
the
false
goods
and
then
he
is
subjected
to
the
multiplication
of
claims
by
acts
over
which
he
has
neither
knowledge
nor
control.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
the
act
--
that
the
impact
of
section
3490
is
on
the
act
committed
by
the
respondent
not
on
the
subsequent
acts
committed
by
the
contractor,
even
though
that
is
one
of
those
subsequent
acts,
this
is
a
necessary
change,
it
is
the
claim
submitted.
mr.
william
rossmoore
yes,
the
act
that
the
respondent
here
committed
was
causing
a
claim
to
be
submitted,
it
was
not
submitting
one
or
35
or
397
claims.
i
suppose
the
problem
with
the
statute
and
the
problem
that
this
court
and
many
of
the
lower
courts
have
wrestled
with
is
that
it
does
find
its
impact
in
such
a
great
variety
of
situations
and
there
has
not
been
no
broad
statement
as
to
what
the
rule
is.
it
has
been
applied
on
a
case-by-case
basis
and
the
courts
of
appeals
has
come
to
different
conclusions
although
most
of
them
i
think,
except
for
the
court
in
the
ueber
case
agree
with
the
position
that
we
take
in
this
case.
and
at
the
risk
of
being
presumptuous,
i
would
like
to
state
what
i
think
might
be
a
formulation
of
a
rule
for
consideration
by
this
court
which
would
operate
fairly,
and
which
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
that
is
that
a
forfeiture
should
be
imposed
for
each
act
or
series
of
acts
or
cause
of
conduct
by
the
defendants
in
the
case
involved,
which
result
in
the
payment
of
a
false
claim
or
claims
by
the
united
states.
this
formulation
puts
the
emphasis
where
it
belongs
on
the
acts
committed
by
the
person
charged
with
the
forfeiture.
so
much
for
the
forfeiture
question,
i
would
want
the
touch
briefly
on
just
two
thoughts
with
respect
to
the
double-damages
issue.
one
is,
and
i
think
it
is
clear,
in
again
in
mr.
justice
black’s
opinion
in
the
marcus
against
hess
case,
that
the
double-damages
provision
originally
came
in
to
this
statute
because
of
the
key
term
provision,
the
informers’
provision,
whereby
it
was
thought
that
most
of
these
actions
at
that
time
would
be
brought
by
informers,
the
informer
would
get
half
of
the
recovery
and
the
government
would
then
be
made
whole
by
its
half
of
the
recovery.
obviously
if
that
was
the
intent,
if
the
government
had
already
been
paid
or
reimbursed
as
it
was
in
this
case
by
a
credit
in
the
same
contract,
no
informer
would
consider
bringing
a
suit,
there
would
be
nothing
to
sue
for,
the
government
had
not
been
damaged.
mr.
william
rossmoore
that
is
the
criminal
statute
is
it
not?
i
think
there
were
informant
fees
but
it
did
not
relate
to
the
question
of
damages,
there
are
many
statues
where
there
are
informant
fees.
i
think
the
public
contracts
act,
the
situation
has
worked
out
pretty
much
as
we
contend
here
that
any
payment
by
the
government
is
first
deducted
before
the
doubling
of
damages.
the
informer
feature
still
remains
in
our
statutes
although
in
a
much
modified
form
in
the
31
u.s.c
section
232,
which
is
the
successor
to
the
revised
statutes
3493.
at
present
though,
and
it
is
only
under
limited
circumstances,
the
informer
can
get
up
to
one-fourth
of
the
recovery
but
it
is
still
there.
one
final
thought,
in
the
hess
case
itself
or
in
the
trial
court
in
u.s.
ex
rel.
marcus
against
hess,
there
were
a
number
of
instances
where
the
government
discovered
the
fraud
before
it
made
payment.
the
defendants’
argued
that
since
the
fraud
had
been
discovered,
there
were
no
damages
and
therefore
there
should
be
no
forfeitures.
and
the
district
court
decision
which
was
eventually
affirmed
in
this
court
held
that
true
there
were
no
damages
to
be
doubled
but
there
was
still
a
claim
for
forfeitures.
this
was
pointed
out
again
in
this
court
in
the
rextrailer
case
on
page
153
footnote
five.
and
i
think
that
in
at
least
in
part
answers
the
question
of
whether
the
government
can
first
double
the
damages
and
then
deduct
any
credit.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
it
cannot
and
should
not
both
because
of
the
history
of
the
way
this
statute
was
put
together
in
the
key
term
actions
and
because
of
the
interpretations
that
have
been
placed
upon
it.
i
will
yield
the
rest
of
my
time
to
mr.
ballan
for
further
comments,
he
represent
mr.
bornstein.
