justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
have
been
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case.
a
case
in
which
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
whatsoever.
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
false
claims
act,
federal
act
provide
that
the
united
states
may
recover
from
a
person
[(00:36)
-
(00:45)audio
corrupt]
double
the
amount
of
damages
that
the
united
states
has
sustained
by
reason
of
the
false
claim.
this
case
presents
two
interpretative
problems
that
arise
when
the
united
states
sues
a
subcontractor
under
the
act
on
the
ground
that
the
subcontractor
has
caused
the
prime
contractor
to
present
false
claims.
the
questions
are
first,
how
should
the
number
of
$2,000
forfeitures
be
counted
in
such
a
situation?
and
second,
when
the
united
states
has
already
recovered
damages
from
the
prime
contractor
because
of
the
subcontractor's
fraud,
what
effect
does
that
recovery
have
upon
the
government's
right
to
recover
double
damages
from
the
subcontractor?
these
problems
of
statutory
construction
do
not
lend
themselves
to
a
very
interesting
or
even
a
very
intelligible,
oral
summary.
in
that
respect,
this
case
is
akin
to
the
one
announced
yesterday
by
my
brother
powell.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
court
holds
today
that
in
determining
the
number
of
$2000
forfeitures,
the
statute
requires
that
the
focus
must
be
upon
the
specific
conduct
of
the
person
from
whom
the
government
is
trying
to
collect
the
forfeitures.
in
this
case
upon
the
acts
of
the
subcontractor,
not
the
acts
of
the
prime
contractor
and
that
in
computing
the
double
damages
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
government's
actual
damages
are
to
be
doubled
before
any
deductions
are
made
for
compensatory
payments,
the
government
may
have
previously
received
from
any
source.
application
of
these
principles
in
the
present
case,
leads
to
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
dissenting
in
part
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
white
have
joined
and
as
i
said
i
think
at
the
outset
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
this
case.
