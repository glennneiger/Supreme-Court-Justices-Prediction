h.
rehnquist
if
only
he
has
authority
to
determine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can’t
hold
it
up
because
he
thinks
it’s
a
bad
deal
for
buyers
or
because
he
thinks
it’s
a
bad
use
of
the
land.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
it
ever
been
suggested
or
held
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
ought
to
file
an
environmental
impact
statement
when
it
permits
of
registration
to
go
into
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
even
that
been
held?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
anywhere
other
than
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
reasoning
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
zabel
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
consistent
with
your
first
scrap
opinion
in
which
we
said
that
the
nepa
does
not
alter
or
amend
any
other
statutory
provision
and
here
you
do
have
a
statutory
provision,
don’t
you
think
that
the
administration
doesn’t
express
any
position
on
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
argument
in
first
scrap
and
was
rejected
by
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
administrator
really
has
almost
no
discretion
in
deciding
whether
to
permit
those
sales.
thus,
once
he’s
satisfied
that
the
truthful
disclosure
has
been
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
all
goes
to
what
the
secretary
may
require
to
be
filed
by
the
developer.
now,
instead
if
the
secretary
or
the
administrator
himself
may
file
in
terms
of
a
proposal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
kind
of
environment
from
the
purchaser’s
point
of
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
filing
of
a
deliberately
false
statement
by
a
developer
subject
to
criminal
liability?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
supposed
anyone
can
write
to
the
criminal
division
or
the
us
attorney
and
say
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
