but
the
law
was
more
patterned
on
the
securities
act
of
1933,
wasn’t
it?
justice

stewart
so,
are
there
any
provisions
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
that
require
impact
statements
or
their
equivalents
by
anybody
but
the
federal
agencies?
justice
potter
stewart
any
aspect
or
any
under
circumstances
to
argue?
justice
potter
stewart
environmental
kind
of
disclosure?
justice
potter
stewart
what
sort
of
development
was
this?
justice
potter
stewart
in
to
how
many
units?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
many
structures?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
talking
about
the
timing
and
you
said
that
hud
doesn’t
plan
any
party
even
as
a
recipient
until
the
time
comes
from
sales
and
i
was
wondering
how
much
is
then
been
done.
not
very
much
actual
construction
of
structures,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
including
sewage
or
septic
tanks
or
whatever?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
the
individual
units?
justice
potter
stewart
the
opinion
said
something
along
the
line,
it
said
it
didn’t
amend
any
other
statutes,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
language
to
which
my
brother
was
referring
to.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
the
federal
action
consisted
only
in
carrying
some
of
the
correspondence
of
this
developer
in
the
united
states
mails
and
yet
the
development
was
absolutely
mammoth
and
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
environment
and
there
was
federal
action
that
was
essential
to
get
his
financing
from
the
new
york
bankers.
would
that
require
an
environmental
impact
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
essential
for
getting
his
financing
without
carrying
it
in
united
states
mails,
is
that
not
possible
to
be
accomplished?
justice
potter
stewart
no
just
in
fact
that
this
was
sent
in
the
mails,
and
you
have
the
present
legislation,
and
you
have
the
present
language
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
of
1969.
justice
potter
stewart
to
get
the
financing.
justice
potter
stewart
your
claim
is
that
in
this
case
that
the
act
that
the
statute
requires
the
agency
to
file
an
impact
statement.
that’s
what’s
at
issue
here,
isn’t
it?
that’s
the
only
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
but
if
you’re
correct
the
statute,
the
1969
act
requires
the
federal
agency
to
file
the
impact
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
and
to
help
in
the
preparation,
and
maybe,
the
agency
can
contract
it
out
or
all
every
other
--
there
are
all
sorts
of
questions
but
the
act
requires
the
agency
ultimately
to
file
it,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
if
you’re
right,
then
that’s
the
agency
that
must
file.
this
case
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
with
what
the
agency
might
or
might
not
have
or
should
require
the
applicant,
the
builder,
the
developer
to
file,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
here
and
the
only
issue
as
i
understand
it
and
you
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong,
also
then
and
maybe
again,
whether
or
not
the
agency
has
to
file
an
environmental
impact
statement.
isn’t
that
the
only
issue
here?
