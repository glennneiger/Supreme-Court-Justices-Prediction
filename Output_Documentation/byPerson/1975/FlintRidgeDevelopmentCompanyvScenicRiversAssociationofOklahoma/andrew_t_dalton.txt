mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
what
we
have
here
is
an
action
brought
by
several
thousand
people
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
who
have
come
together
in
one
way
or
another,
in
action
against
the
federal
government
to
seek
compliance
and
enforcement
of
federal
law.
the
shorthand
law
is
nepa,
of
course
we
have
a
problem
when
we
used
the
shorthand
of
sometimes
forgetting
what
the
meaning
of
the
language
is.
it's
the
national
environmental
policy
act.
there
has
been
intent
to
interject
before
this
court,
issues
a
fact
and
law
that
were
not
litigated
in
the
trial
court,
were
not
presented
before
the
tenth
circuit
and
have
no
basis
in
the
record
or
anything
we’re
doing
here
today.
for
example,
we’ll
start
off
with
this
proposition;
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
absolutely
refuses
to
comply
with
the
national
and
environmental
policy
act,
period.
that’s
what
started
this
lawsuit.
the
issue
before
this
court
or
non
issues
before
this
court,
is
not
how
you
do
an
environmental
impact
statement
but
for
example,
ceq
and
hud
co-sponsored
a
study
concerning
the
environmental
consequences
of
these
second
home
developments
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
that
study
was
to
provide
an
outline
and
an
environmental
information
based
handbook
that
can
be
used
to
evaluate
the
consequences.
other
people
have
developed
handbooks,
there's
one
by
(inaudible).
it's
a
detailed
handbook
on
how
to
do
these
things.
it's
not
the
type
of
eis
that
is
involved
here.
we
can't
get
to
that
issue
until
we
agree
to
do
something.
another
things
not
at
issue
before
this
court
is
what
to
do
with
environmental
impact
statement
and
whatever
form
it
takes
once
it
is
done.
now,
the
state
of
new
mexico
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
and
is
suggested
in
their
brief
many
things
that
can
be
done,
and
perfectly
consistent
with
the
act
in
102
(g),
and
i
believe
it
is
now
of
circulating
it
among
the
states
and
local
agencies
the
information
that
can
be
obtained
and
they
say
that
they
will
utilize
it
and
they
need
it
very
desperately.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
it
could
very
well
provide
information
with
respect
to
the
accuracy
of
the
filing.
it
could
very
well
provide
information
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
the
act
itself.
in
other
words,
there
are
many
things
that
the
administrative
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes
sir.
and
in
the
record
also,
we
have
sworn
testimony
from
several
officials
from
the
state
of
oklahoma
from
offices
of
planning
and
development,
from
offenses
of
pollution
control
and
recreation
concerning
the
use
and
utilization
which
they
would
put
with
the
information
and
asking
for
the
information
and
that’s
consistent
with
the
act
itself.
it's
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act.
another
thing
that’s
not
before
this
court
in
terms
of
issue
is
whether
you
can
disapprove
a
filing
on
environmental
grounds.
now,
there
are
cases
such
as
zabel
v.
tabb
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
say
you
can
disapprove
on
environmental
grounds.
i
believe
they
did
similar
things
in
marco
island
here
just
recently,
101
(b).
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
simply
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
in
particularly
101
provides
substantive
authority
to
the
agency
involved
and
consider
environmental
matters
and
could
reduce
or
suspend
or
prevent
a
permit
on
environmental
grounds.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
i
don’t
think
it's
a
matter
of
amendment,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
an
enlargement
giving
the
agency
one
more
thing
to
consider.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
well,
i
don’t
myself
understand
scrap
to
mean
that.
i
understand
scrap
one
to
mean
nepa
did
not
revive
a
judicial
remedy
that
has
been
previously
excluded.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes
sir.
i
don’t
think
that
in
another
issue
is
not
what
the
hud
can
do
anything
about
environmental
degradation
it
finds.
although
there
are
i
believe
many
things
they
can
do
about
it,
provide
information
to
others
for
example
and
in
hud
--
hud
has
promulgated
what
is
called
handbook
1390.1.
there
are
guidelines
for
compliance
with
the
national
environmental
policy
act
and
part
of
that,
part
of
that
requires
and
directs
the
members
of
the
department
to
meet
with
and
discuss
these
matters
with
the
developer
or
the
applicant
to
work
out
an
amicable
way
of
resolving
some
of
these
things
without
necessarily
through
an
enforcement
procedure.
now,
there
are
other
things
that
are
not
at
issue
before
this
court
and
i
think
it
goes
to
the
question
of
what
really
is
at
issue.
the
facts
are
not
an
issue,
the
significance
of
the
degradation
is
not
at
issue.
judge
bohanon
found
actual
potential
effect
in
all
aspects
of
the
environment.
for
example,
upon
the
depth
and
course
of
the
river
itself,
upon
social
economic
conditions,
aesthetic
conditions,
the
habitat,
fish
and
wildlife,
these
were
un-appealed
from
and
not
an
issue
before
this
court
and
you
will
find
that
his
finding
number
14.
another
matter
that
is
not
an
issue
before
this
court
and
which
is
admitted
is
that
the
filing
and
the
permission
to
sell
interstate
commerce
facilitates
the
developer
in
obtaining
money
in
interstate
commerce
and
without
that,
this
development
would
not
exist.
they
talked
about
there
would
degradation
anyway.
well,
that’s
a
talking
about
something
in
the
abstract
because
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
would
not
be
degradation
anyway.
we
note
that
they
have
said,
they
are
not
doing
anything
now.
much
of
this
money
is
spent
for
other
things
in
environmental
degradation.
for
example,
in
the
record
and
it
reflects
that
less
than
one
half
of
the
payrolls
are
in
place.
less
than
one-third
of
the
unpaid
rolls
are
in
place.
there
are
only
16
of
a
potential
of
3,000
septic
tanks
in
an
area
that’s
ill-suited
for
septic
tanks
according
to
the
findings
of
the
court.
there
virtually
no
structures
existing
on
the
7,000
acres.
the
human
involvement
there
is
minimal
at
best.
the
socio
economic
problems
that
would
ensue
as
a
result
of
this
development
are
yet
to
occur
and
will
occur
in
the
future
and
perhaps
by
thinking
about
it
now,
we
may
be
able
to
mitigate
that
either
to
state,
local
or
federal
level.
another
problem
of
that
argument
is
they
can
ask
you
to
freeze
in
point
and
time
the
question
of
environmental
impact.
and
consider
the
flint
ridge
as
in
a
vacuum
which
the
court
did
not
do.
there
are
peripheral
effects,
other
developments
may
occur,
side
issues
with
respect
to
developments.
so,
there
are
satellite
developments
and
this
sort
of
thing
may
occur
and
this
is
a
very
fragile
ecosystem,
the
illinois
river
basin.
we
also
see
that
many
of
the
effects
that
will
flow
from
this
development
will
be
continuing
in
nature.
we
also
suggested
the
option
for
example
for
14,000
more
acres
has
been
dropped
and
some
of
the
things
they
talk
about,
about
exempting
laws
and
so
forth,
they
haven’t
done
it.
in
fact,
in
a
letter
to
this
court
asking
that
it
be
advanced
for
hearing,
they
did
complain
of
the
fact
that
they
were
at
a
stand
still
if
you
will.
so,
there
is
significance
to
what
the
tenth
circuit
said
and
what
judge
bohanon
said
about
money
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
connection
between
the
filing,
the
approval
to
sell
interstate
commerce
and
the
obtaining
of
money,
and
the
environmental
degradation.
the
issue
in
this
case
must
be
considered
to
what
hud
is
trying
to
do.
hud
is
trying
to
get
this
court
to
condone
their
excessively
narrow
construction
of
their
operating
authority
inspite
of
what
congress
said.
the
issue
is
very
simple,
must
hud
under
the
facts
of
this
case
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
in
a
format
tailored
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
prior
to
giving
permission
to
sell
in
interstate
commerce.
the
answer
is
simple,
yes
they
must
and
why?
it
is
compelled
by
the
language
of
statute
itself
by
this
legislative
history
of
the
statute
by
all
cases
which
are
construed
in
the
national
environmental
policy
act
to
date,
by
ceq
guidelines
and
by
hud’s
own
handbook
1390.1.
do
we
have
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment?
and
you
can't
bifurcate
that
language.
it's
all
part
of
the
same
term
and
whether
you
have
two
or
three
tests
really
don’t
make
any
difference
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
have
proven
in
the
record
and
accepted
by
the
trial
court
and
the
tenth
circuit
facts
to
reflect
each
test.
we
have
proven
magnitude,
we
have
proven
controversy,
we
have
proven
cumulative
effect,
we
have
proven
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
the
major
federal
action?
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
well,
the
federal
action
to
begin
is
the
giving
of
permission
to
sell
in
interstate
commerce
as
the
result
of
a
filing.
it
becomes
major
when
you
consider
the
end
result
that
occurs
and
that
is
the
substantial,
actual,
potential
or
cumulative
effect
of
the
environment.
they
stated
for
example
in
simmons
v.
grant
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
but
for
this
filing
the
degradation
will
not
take
place.
in
other
words,
they
are
not
going
to
do
anything
unless
they
get
that
money
in
interstate
commerce
as
stated
in
the
minnesota
pirg
case
v.
butz.
it
makes
little
sense
to
call
a
federal
action
minor
when
the
end
result
whether
it
be
by
public
authority
or
by
private
authority,
is
major.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
well,
i'm
not
certain
that’s
a
federal
action
in
terms
of
a
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
if
we
assume
hypothetically
that
there
is
a
statute
which
requires
the
use
of
the
united
states
mails
to
send
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
and
they
utilized
the
mails
to
mail
documents
to
bankers
and
so
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
and
to
solicit
sales,
i
think
probably
in
that
situation
you
may
have
nothing,
i
believe
nothing
which
would
result
in
degradation
substantially
because
of
federal
involvement
although
i
can
see,
i
can
see
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
sir?
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes
sir,
if
that’s
a
necessary
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
fine.
and
that
being
the
case,
that
being
the
case
that
becomes
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
quality
in
the
environment
and
would
require
compliance
in
my
opinion,
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
you
can
get
money
through
interstate
commerce
although
there
is
the
option
available
here
not
to
get
money
in
the
interstate
commerce.
in
other
words,
to
--
there
are
specific
exemptions
in
the
act
itself
in
which
they
could
obtain
money
in
interstate
commerce
but
not
have
to
qualify
under
the
interstate
land
sales
act.
and
they
could’ve
also
gone
strictly
intrastate.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
in
as
far
as
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
is
concerned,
the
only
thing
they
do
is
administer
the
interstate
land
sales
act.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
the
giving
of
permission
to
sell
in
the
interstate
commerce
which
resulted
in
significant
effect
on
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes,
sir
that’s
all,
in
any
case.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes,
sir.
in
my
opinion,
they
would.
i
think
probably,
to
maybe
get
to
some
of
these
questions,
they’re
more
directly.
the
national
environmental
policy
act
is
one
thing,
is
an
administrative
reform
statute.
and
it
is
designed
to
achieve
a
certain
amount
of
cooperation
among
all
of
the
federal
agencies.
now,
one
of
the
problems
with
the
arguments
that’s
been
presented
today
and
probably
one
of
the
underlying
premises
of
the
question
is
that
we’re
talking
about
hud
existing
in
a
vacuum.
there
are
other
federal
agencies.
now,
if
hud
can’t
do
anything
about
it,
they
are
required
to
provide
the
information
and
should
provide
the
information
to
other
federal
agencies,
state
agencies
and
local
agencies
which
may
in
fact
be
able
to
do
something
about
it
whether
hud
can
or
will.
so,
i
think
probably
the
answer
to
your
question
is
very
definitely
yes.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
the
answer
to
your
question
is
definitely
yes
because
we
cannot
consider
the
lead
agency
or
the
responsible
agency
in
the
vacuum.
they
are
required
to
cooperate
with
other
agencies
which
may
and
can
and
probably
will
do
something
about
it.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
that’s
true
but
you
know
and
probably
there’s
a
fear
that
environmental
impact
statement
may
look
something
like
the
(inaudible)
situation.
i
think
we
can
tailor
to
the
circumstances
at
hand.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes
sir,
well,
in
this
case,
the
hud
handbook
1390.1
requires
such
information.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
it
should
be,
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
well
that
could
be
the
format
of
the
environmental
impact
statement
takes.
the
development
of
that
type
of
information
which
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
in
our
opinion,
when
we
began
this
act
or
this
action,
we
felt
that
our
position
was
limited
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
illinois
river
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
we
discern
or
felt
we
may
have
some
problems
with
respect
to
standing
in
some
other
issues
limited
amount
of
approach.
we
could
take
and
we
directed
our
question
to
the
illinois
river.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
if
that
rule
were
consistent
with
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
yes.
and
we’re
promulgated
in
response
to
the
national
environment
policy
act.
i
see
no
--
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
yes,
the
agency
is
required
to
file
it.
i
don’t
know
that
the
development
of
the
information
necessarily
must
come
out
of
the
minds
and
pockets
of
the
agency.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
well,
that’s
true
to
some
extent.
of
course,
nepa
has
been
amended
to
allow
certain
circumstances,
state
agencies
which
have
statewide
e
jurisdiction
to
participate
or
prepare
this
instance.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
they
will
accept
responsibility
for
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
well,
only
in
the
sense
that
the
act
is
a
mandate
to
be
innovative
and
to
try
to
develop
ways
and
means
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
comply
with
the
act
which
is
the
language
of
the
act
itself.
and
also
not
to
use
an
excessively
narrow
construction
of
his
operating
authority
to
avoid
compliance,
which
is
the
language
of
congress.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
i
think
it
is
proposal
for
recommendation
and
so
forth,
it
falls
within
the
category
of
other
major
federal
action
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment
term
in
that
section
which
has
to
do
with
the
decision
to
permit
the
sales
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
is
the
triggering
action.
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
and
once
he’s
satisfied,
true
but
he
has
tremendous
or
she
has
tremendous
discriminate
or
discretion
in
determining
what
is
necessary
before
there
is
adequate
compliance.
not
only
what
is
necessary
in
protection
of
the
purchaser,
what’s
necessary
in
the
protection
of
the
public
interest
and
which
would
make
the
filing
not
misleading
under
the
circumstances.
these
are
left
for
the
secretary
and
her
administrator
to
determine
mr.
andrew
t.
dalton
no,
but
these,
yes
that’s
a
thing
--
it
is
what
is
developed
in
compliance
with
the
act
and
when
you
have
superimposed
upon
the
interstate
land
sales
act,
the
requirement
of
compliance
with
nepa,
this
will
include
environmental
information
sufficient
to
apprise
all
parties,
all
agencies
of
the
government,
state
local,
and
federal,
environmental
consequences.
see,
what
we
have
here,
i
think
is
a
statutory
mandate
to
exercise
compliance
with
the
act
to
the
fullest
extent
possible.
it
is
not
inherently
flexible.
we
must
construe
this
statute,
the
natural
environmental
policy
act
from
its
four
corners.
we
can’t
pick
out
102
(2)
(c)
and
say
that
this
is
the
only
part
of
the
act.
i
think
all
of
the
cases
and
you
know
statutory
construction
do
tell
us
that.
it’s
a
mixed
question
of
a
law
and
fact
involved
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
things
they
said
scrap
in
this
case.
they
talked
about
a
so-called
conflict
and
this
does
deals
with
this
30-day
thing.
we
must
begin
with
the
preface
that
in
order
to
avoid
compliance,
the
act,
it
must
be
impossible
or
it
must
expressly
prohibited.
now
first
of
all,
is
question
of
conflict
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
of
courts,
so
it’s
not
been
litigated
and
there
are
no
facts
before
this
court
in
respect
the
conflict.
again,
we’re
not
talking
about
how
you
do
in
eis.
the
tenth
circuit
described
this
as
a
superficial
argument
and
quite
correctly.
the
ilsa,
the
interstate
land
sales
act
and
nepa
are
very
compatible.
they’re
both
full
disclosure
laws,
they
both
provide
information
in
the
public
interest,
and
in
fact
if
you
get
into
the
legislative
history
of
both
of
them,
they
use
virtually
identical
language.
there
is
no
specific
exemption
to
compliance
in
ilsa.
now,
both
the
interstate
land
sales
act
and
nepa
have
been
amended
and
in
fact
since
the
investigation
of
this
litigation.
now,
i’m
sure
that
congress
knows
how
to
exempt
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
from
compliance.
they
do
so
by
saying
that
nothing
herein
shall
be
considered
major
federal
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
they
have
done
it
in
several
statutes
but
not
in
this
one.
to
come
before
this
court
and
argue
that
there
is
a
conflict
is
to
admit
a
specific
violation
of
section
103.
section
103,
required
all
these
agencies,
hud
included,
to
review
their
operating
authority
and
their
statutory
mandate,
to
determine
whether
there
are
any
inseparable
barriers
to
compliance.
there’s
nothing
to
indicate
that
that
review
process
was
to
await
the
taking
of
major
federal
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment.
it
was
to
be
done
by
date
certain.
we
must
conclude
therefore
that
hud
did
it,
and
found
no
inseparable
barrier
to
compliance.
as
the
court
said
calvert
cliffs,
it’s
too
late
now
to
raise
this
argument.
compliance
is
consistent
with
ceq
guidelines.
ceq
guidelines
talked
about
a
license
and
entitlement
to
use
or
a
permit.
and
in
fact,
the
ceq
itself,
in
the
letter
dated
january
or
july
7th,
1975
from
the
director,
to
david
o.
meeker
of
housing
and
urban
development,
talked
of
several
items
that
needed
further
discussion
and
attention.
and
among
these
evidence
that
concerned
about
nepa
compliance
in
the
office
of
the
interstate
land
sales
and
suggested
ways
of
complying
such
as
the
incorporate
information
in
the
environmental
impacts
in
the
statement
of
record,
establish
thresholds
to
determine
significance,
prepare
program
eis
and
this
sort
of
thing.
and
he
said,
“we
believe
that
hud
could
solve
the
issue
by
taking
steps
in
line
with
the
above
suggestions.”
so,
ceq
themselves
feels
that
there
is
not
compliance
and
of
course
they’re
entitled
--
their
determination
entitled
a
great
weight.
is
there
a
conflict
by
administrative
burden?
they
talked
about
the
administrative
burden
in
their
briefs.
we
begin
with
the
preface
that
congress
did
intend
to
interrupt
business
as
usual
in
these
agencies
which
here
to
for
have
not
cared
one
iota.
and
before
this
court
today,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
does
not
care
one
iota
about
the
environment.
the
gao,
i
think
and
we’ve
cited
this
in
our
brief
has
criticized
them,
and
i
think
they’ve
quite
correctly
characterized
their
lack
of
concern
as
based
on
empire
building.
we
could
go
further
and
to
say
they
flat
don’t
care.
the
facts
of
the
case
control
was
the
type
of
compliance
and
it’s
not
that
difficult.
one
of
the
purposes,
i
think,
we
pointed
out
has
been
partially
fulfilled
and
that
is
inter-agency
cooperation.
the
statute
must
be
read
as
whole
and
to
foster
inter-agency
cooperation
as
one
of
the
purposes.
whether
hud
can
or
will
do
anything
about
the
substantial
destruction
or
the
total
destruction
of
this
river
in
the
whole
basin
is
not
an
issue,
it
is
whether
maybe
somebody
else
can
and
resolve
the
information
as
being
take
or
the
actions
being
taken.
it’s
just
not
impossible
to
comply.
they
can
pre-file
it,
they
can
include
it
in
their
filing,
they
can
use
their
1390.1
format,
they
can
make
a
rule.
gentlemen,
the
cases
below
are
correct
in
all
respects.
they’re
legally
correct
based
upon
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
the
cases
that
have
construed
the
act
to
date,
and
all
of
the
regulations
in
guidelines
that
are
involved.
they’re
economically
correct.
we’re
trying
to
internalize
our
true
costs
and
recognize
those
ultimately.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
was
to
learn
and
quantify
all
of
these
costs
and
so
that
they
can
be
taken
into
consideration
for
the
protection
of
the
public
and
the
public
interest.
it
is
ethically
correct.
we
have
tried
to
evolve
through
time,
a
course
of
ethics
that
people
dealing
with
the
people
and
the
people
dealing
with
their
society.
today,
we
have
not
really
realized
a
firm
ethic
between
or
among
people
of
their
society
and
their
environment.
the
national
environmental
policy
act
says,
“to
create,
foster
and
maintain
a
state
or
productive
harmony
between
man
and
his
environment.”
that
is
nothing
more
than
a
statement
of
the
principle
of
ethics.
to
reverse
this
case,
will
be
to
deny
the
ethical
content
of
the
act
and
to
deny
the
evolutionary
principles
of
ethics
involved.
we
must
continue
to
restore
and
maintain
that
state
of
productivity,
and
if
we
do
not,
we’re
in
for
a
lot
of
trouble,
particularly
in
illinois
river
basin.
nepa
is
a
vehicle
to
provide
us
the
information.
and
until
we
have
that
information
to
act
intelligently,
to
make
intelligent
decisions,
then
we
will
continue
to
operate
in
the
dark.
and
to
violate
the
expressed
and
exact
intent
of
congress
that
we
no
longer
continue
to
ignore
the
environmental
consequences
of
our
decisions
at
every
agency
level
at
the
lowest
level
possible
in
congress.
thank
you,
we
ask
that
you
would
affirm.
