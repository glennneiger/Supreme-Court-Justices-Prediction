mr.
dalton,
let
me
give
you
another
one.
suppose
there
is
a
securities
registration
statement
filed
with
respect
to
a
bond
issue,
the
procedure
what
will
be
used
for
the
an
off
shore
oil
rig
which
if
installed
would
certainly
have
the
environmental
consequences.
does
the
sec
because
it
could
disapprove
have
to
file
an
environmental
impact
statement?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
it
even
quite
that?
the
statute
doesnâ€™t
speak
in
terms
of
filing
the
statement.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
the
agency
including
a
statement
with
a
proposal
or
recommendation.
i
was
curious
to
know
precisely,
what
is
the
proposal
that
is
supposed
to
incorporate
the
environmental
impact
statement
under
your
theory
of
the
sequence
of
events
that
the
agencies
just
to
follow
here.
