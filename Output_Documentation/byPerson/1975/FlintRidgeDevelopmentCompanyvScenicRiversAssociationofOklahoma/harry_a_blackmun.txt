thus
affirmative
answer
then
really
mean,
the
sec
in
almost
every
securities
registration
situation
has
to
file
an
environmental
impact
statement.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
dalton,
do
you
think,
it
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
need
of
other
agencies
and
of
local
authorities,
if
the
administrator
here
or
if
the
sec
in
that
context
had
a
rule
which
required
detailed
information
from
the
filer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
that
--
assume
it's
true,
assume
every
filing
would
be
true,
would
the
environmental
information
then
be
there
of
public
record?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
would
the
agency
have
to
prepare
a
statement
to
inform
–-
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then,
why
shouldn’t
you
--
why
isn’t
there
a
more
sensible
way
of
going
about
the
problem
under
this
act
to
start
--
to
attack
the
rules
to
say
that
there
should
be
a
different
rule
about
the
filing
and
its
contents?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
you
might
not
be
here
at
all
if
the
administrator
had
what
you
sought
was
an
adequate
rule
with
respect
to
what
the
developer
had
to
file.
