i
think
there
are
some
statements
that
are
required
in
the
filling
that
relate
to
the
environment.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
just
thought
that
some
of
those
statements
are
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
do
you
call
in
the
administrator?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
the
administrator
know
whether
they’re
false
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
view
that
the
phrase
major
federal
action
is
the
critical
phrase?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
statute
is
that
the
national
environmental
policy
act
of
1969
does
not
apply
if
the
--
even
though
the
action
is
major
unless
the
federal
participation
in
the
action
is
also
major,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
virtue
of
minor
participation
by
the
federal
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
plan
that
this
is
not
federal
action
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
was
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
impact
statement
ought
to
be
prepared
and
filed
so
that
the
administrator
can
tell
whether
the
disclosures
are
adequate
and
accurate?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
just
a
--
that
the
statement
is
a
statement
of
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
would
--
instead
of
making
an
investigation
of
this
field
force
and
have
them
write
a
report
to
him,
he
has
them
write
a
environmental
impact
statement
saying,
“here
are
the
facts.
here’s
what
this
will
do.”
and
then
he
tries
to
tell
whether
the
disclosures
and
the
filing
are
adequate
and
accurate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
has
to
do
that,
doesn’t
he?
he
has
to
make
his
mind
whether
he’s
going
to
approve
this
filing
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
he
send
people
out,
i
suppose
that
you’ve
suggested
to
see
if
this
disclosure
were
enacted.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
also
state
--
tell
state
enforcement
authorities.
justice
byron
r.
white
something
that
they
might
not
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
make
litigation
on
it
beyond
that
district
of
columbia
litigation
that
you
know
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
claim
in
other
words.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
which
you
think
should
be
filed
will
bear
at
all
on
the
decision
by
the
administrator
with
respect
to
the
filing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
would
--
i
take
it
you
would
be
here,
however,
even
if
the
filing
required
nothing
at
all
with
respect
to
the
environment.
no
facts
at
all
that
could
be
called
environmental.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
in
mind
the
facts
of
my
hypothetical.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
in
mind
that
--
justice
byron

white
the
financing
--
financing
wouldn’t
be
possible
but
without
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
regulation
require
the
disclosure
of
any
environmental
facts
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
in
the
papers
we
have?
justice
byron

1710.105?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
statute
bears
on
this
if
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
it
in
your
brief?
justice
byron

at
the

(a)
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
subsection?
justice
byron

(voice

the
disclosure
as
this
is
very
noisy?
justice

and
terrible
drainage?

anybody
