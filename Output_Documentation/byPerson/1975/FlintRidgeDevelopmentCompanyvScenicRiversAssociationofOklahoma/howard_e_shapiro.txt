mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
question
is
whether
an
environmental
impact
statement
must
be
prepared
by
the
administrator
of
the
office
of
interstate
land
sales
registration
before
the
registration
of
subdivision
lots
under
the
interstate
land
sales
full
disclosure
act
of
1968
may
become
effective.
to
state
the
meaning
of
the
question,
i’ll
have
to
explain
the
disclosure
act.
the
disclosure
act
requires
developers
selling
or
leasing
50
or
more
unimproved
lot
pursuant
to
a
common
promotional
plan
to
file
a
registration
statement
called
the
statement
of
record
with
the
administrator.
the
administrator
is
the
delegate
of
the
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
to
whom
the
functions
of
carrying
out
the
disclosure
act
have
been
assigned
by
congress.
the
act
also
requires
the
developer
to
furnish
a
document
called
a
property
report
to
each
purchaser
of
a
lot
within
the
registered
subdivision.
the
property
report
contains
information
from
the
statement
of
record
which
purchasers
need
to
make
their
decisions
and
the
statement
of
record
is
a
detailed
description
of
the
property,
its
ownership,
title,
access
roads,
and
so
on.
in
some
respects,
the
entire
process
is
like
a
security’s
registration
and
the
property
report
is
a
good
deal
like
a
security’s
prospectus
describing
a
particular
subdivision.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
it
was
your
honor
and
i
think
that’s
quite
a
significant
point
in
viewing
the
act
because
the
securities
act
of
1933
really
represented
a
choice
for
congress
to
go
two
ways.
it
could
have
decided
in
favor
of
some
degree
of
substantive
regulation
of
the
economic
merits
of
securities
issues
and
instead
it
opted
simply
for
a
disclosure
requirement.
when
congress
decided
that
there
were
problems
about
the
interstate
sale
of
subdivision
lots,
it
could’ve
done
the
same
thing.
it
could’ve
empowered
the
administrator
to
consider
the
merits
of
subdivision
lots
and
make
comments
and
recommendations
on
them.
instead
it
opted
for
not
substantive
regulation,
but
simply
a
system
of
full
disclosure.
this
law
was
enacted
in
1968,
your
honor.
now,
unless
these
disclosure
statements
are
on
file
and
in
effect,
the
developer
may
not
use
the
mails
or
facilities
of
interstate
commerce
to
sell
or
lease
the
lot.
the
statute
provides
that
the
administrator
has
30
days
from
the
date
the
developer
files
the
disclosure
statements
with
his
office
to
determine
whether
they
are
accurate
and
complete
in
their
disclosures
under
the
act
and
the
regulations.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that’s
all
he
has
authority
to—
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
in
fact
the
act
is
explicit
on
that,
your
honor.
it
provides
in
section
1716
of
the
u.s.
code,
15
u.s.c
1716
that
a
registration
may
not
be
taken
to
mean
that
the
secretary
was
delegate
here,
the
administrator
has
passed
upon
the
merits,
that’s
the
language
of
the
statute,
has
passed
upon
the
merits
of
the
development
or
has
approved
it.
so
the
congress
was
quite
clear,
they
did
not
want
any
kind
of
comment
by
the
federal
government
or
controlled
by
the
federal
government
over
the
merits
of
land
use
planning
or
the
use
of
subdivisions
in
anyway.
they
simply
wanted
disclosure
to
protect
purchasers.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
they
do.
the
statute
calls
for
disclosure
of
information
about
nuisances
and
sewage
and
drainage.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
if
anything
required
by
the
statute
or
regulation
is
false,
we
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
administrator.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
he
has
a
field
force
which
does
some
inspecting
in
connection
with
registrations.
and
if
there
are
false
statements
that
violates
the
statute,
it
could
be
a
criminal
offense
to
violate
the
statute.
in
any
event,
the
administrator
has
the
power
to
suspend
the
registration
just
as
the
sec
does
for
false
or
inaccurate
statements.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
or
an
incomplete
statement
and
this
brings
to
the
time
limits
in
the
statute.
the
process
works
under
strict
time
limits.
the
developer
submits
his
disclosure
statements
when
he’s
ready
to
begin
sales
and
he
wants
to
use
the
facilities
of
interstate
commerce.
the
statements
in
this
record
which
i
think
are
plaintiff’s
exhibit
one
are
typical.
it’s
a
document
several
inches
thick.
once
the
statements
are
filed,
the
30-day
limit
that
congress
has
imposed
on
the
administrator
to
complete
clearance
of
those
statements
goes
into
effect,
starts
ticking
away.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
if
the
administrator
finds
that
they
are
--
that
the
registration
statements
proposed
by
the
developer
are
deficient.
he
can
suspend
it
until
corrections
are
made
and
when
the
--
well,
what
he’ll
do
is
advice
that
the
registration
is
suspended.
the
administrator
has
--
i
mean
the
developer
then
has
a
strong
incentive
to
get
the
corrections
in
and
when
the
corrections
are
filed,
another
30
days
starts
ticking
away
and
the
effort
is
then
made
by
the
administrator
to
complete
his
review
before
that
30
days.
when
that’s
over,
the
administrator
sends
a
letter,
nothing
more,
just
a
letter
to
the
developer
saying,
“your
registration
is
effective.”
and
that
letter
is
not
an
approval
of
the
merits
of
the
project
or
a
report
of
any
kind.
it’s
not
even
a
license.
it’s
simply
a
notification.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
to
that
extent.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
every
case
to
ensure
that
there
is
adequate
disclosure.
now,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
the
secretary
and
the
acting
administrator
and
a
private
developer
who’s
the
disclosure
statements
were
suspended
by
the
court’s
below
until
hud
had
prepared
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
the
merits
of
the
project
involved.
that
project
known
as
flint
ridge
is
located
on
heights
above
the
illinois
river
which
is
70
miles
east
of
tulsa
roughly
in
northeastern
oklahoma.
respondents,
the
plaintiffs
below
were
environmental
groups
concerned
with
the
preservation
of
the
illinois
river
in
its
natural
state.
they
sued
to
prevent
flint
ridge’s
disclosure
statements
from
becoming
effective
until
hud
had
prepared
an
environmental
impact
statement
on
the
development.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
respondents
and
suspended
flint
ridge’s
registration
until
an
impact
statement
is
completed
by
the
administrator.
now,
in
our
view
this
case
only
involves
one
issue
whether
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
the
national
environmental
policy
act
or
nepa
applies
to
hud’s
supervision
of
developer’s
disclosures
under
the
lands
sales
disclosure
act.
there’s
no
question
here
that
the
nepa
applies
in
full
to
hud’s
activities
respecting
substantive
regulation
of
any
kind
or
grants
or
other
substantive
activities.
but
we’re
dealing
with
a
narrow
question
that
is
what
section
102
(2)
(c)
requires
in
a
situation
like
this
where
this
is
no
substantive
regulation.
section
102
(2)
(c)
of
nepa
in
effect
requires
federal
agencies
to
include
in
every
recommendation
or
report
on
proposals
for
legislation
and
other
major
federal
actions
significantly
affecting
the
quality
of
the
human
environment,
a
detailed
statement
concerning
environmental
effects
and
alternatives.
it
requires
a
federal
agency
to
weigh
the
environmental
merits
of
their
planning
and
substantive
decision
making.
but
in
our
view,
it
doesn’t
apply
at
every
point
of
federal
contact
with
the
private
sector.
there
has
to
be
a
federal
proposal
or
recommendation
for
and
a
report
on
major
federal
action.
the
language
of
102
(c)
is
qualified.
now,
the
administrator
here
is
empowered
to
review
disclosure
statements
as
this
has
already
been
indicated
only
for
accuracy
and
completeness.
this,
we
submit,
is
not
major
federal
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
it’s
not
major
federal
action
because
the
administrator
cannot
pass
on
the
merits
of
projects
and
of
course,
you
cannot
write
an
environmental
statement
without
passing
on
its
merits
at
least
to
waive
them
and
to
list
alternatives
so
that
that
point
seems
quite
clearly
barred
by
the
statute
itself
expressly
and
it’s
also
barred
because
of
the
nature
of
the
function
since
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
disclosure
function.
secondly,
we
submit
that
the
administrator
makes
no
recommendation
or
report
on
a
proposal
for
major
federal
action.
now,
i’ve
already
indicated
that
the
statute
bars
the
administrator
from
passing
on
the
merits
or
proving
any
subdivision.
what
congress
intended,
was
that
land
use
planning
should
be
reserved
to
that
state.
in
fact,
it
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
no
developer
can
represent
that
the
secretary
has
approved
or
recommends
any
particular
development
and
that’s
even
reflected
in
the
property
report
as
described
in
the
regulations
since
on
the
face
of
every
property
report
there’s
a
disclaimer.
that
this
property
report
does
not
represent
any
approval
by
the
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
or
any
comment
on
the
merits.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
is
it
exactly
in
that
phrase.
it’s
qualified.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
essentially
it,
your
honor,
because
what
we’re
dealing
with
here,
what
really
what
we’re
saying
is
that
you
cannot
turn
major
private
action
into
major
federal
action
by
virtue
of
environmental
act.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
exactly
the
point
your
honor
and
we
think
that
this
was
clearly
congress’
intent
in
the
disclosure
act
because
of
the
provisions
they
included
in
it
barring
comment
on
the
merits
because
the
legislative
history
where
congress
in
the
senate
report
expressly
said
that
the
government
may
not
pass
upon
the
quality
of
what
is
being
sold
or
upon
such
questions
as
land
value,
land
use
or
zoning.
they
clearly
left
the
whole
question
of
land
use
planning
to
the
states.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
no.
clearly
the
administrator
has
a
federal
responsibility.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
that’s
correct
and
this
becomes
even
clear
when
you
look
at
what
the
administrator
does
not
do.
he
has
no
land
use
planning
functions.
he
doesn’t
disperse
any
funds.
he
doesn’t
give
any
hud
guarantees.
he
has
no
control
over
the
design
of
subdivisions.
he’s
not
permitted
to
stop
a
private
development
or
to
direct
the
developer
to
go
ahead.
he’s
not
in
any
sense
in
partnership
with
the
private
developer.
indeed
in
this
case,
there
are
no
federal
funds
of
any
kind
involved
and
no
federal
planning
involved
in
the
flint
ridge
development.
it’s
a
private
enterprise.
when
you
consider
this
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
administrator
normally
has
30
days
in
which
to
complete
his
review
before
one
of
his
statements
automatically
becomes
effective,
it’s
apparent
that
you
cannot
get
an
environmental
impact
statement
requirement
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
one
reason
is
that
it’s
the
administrator
who
has
to
prepare
the
impact
statement.
what
the
argument
would
be
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
it
is
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
impact
statement
in
that
context
would
serve
as
primarily
as
a
checkup
on
the
developer,
that’s
what
you’re
implying
that
we
could
have
it
as
a
checkup
on
the
developer.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
that
the
principal
check
on
the
developer
is
the
obligation
to
make
truthful
statements
and
there’s
criminal
sanctions
that
follow
if
doesn’t
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
they
usually
they
inspect
the
registered
subdivisions
themselves
to
see
that
there
haven’t
been
changes
as
a
very
limited
field
force.
but
the
statute
itself
wouldn’t
permit
the
preparation
of
this
within
the
30
days.
i
mean
the
most
environmental
impact
statements
take
at
least
to
120
days
to
prepare.
on
a
major
project
the
great
deal
longer,
so
that
the
administrator
really
has
to
rely
on
the
submission
by
the
developer
and
most
developers
are
truthful.
there’s
another
function
which
an
impact
statement
could
serve,
i
suppose,
and
that
is
that
it
could
tell
purchasers
about
the
nature
of
the
development,
but
that’s
not
involved
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
that’s
one
of
things
the
amici
argued
here,
but
that’s
not
involved
in
this
kind
of
a
case
because
there
hasn’t
been
any
request
here
that
the
basic
document
for
giving
information
to
purchasers
and
the
state
authorities,
namely
the
registration
statement
be
amended
to
include
more
environmental
information.
they
haven’t
requested
that
the
regulations
be
amended.
they
simply
say
that,
“well,
we’d
like
more
information,
therefore
you
must
file
an
impact
statement.”
now,
given
the
fact
that
congress
intended
land
use
planning
to
be
for
the
states,
it
seems
to
me
rather
difficult
to
argue,
for
a
state
particularly
to
argue
that
“well,
we
need
more
information
so
the
federal
government
ought
give
us
information.”
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
section
102
(2)
(c)
as
i
understand
that
applies
only
to
the
federal
government.
there’s
no
provision
for
private
developers
to
file.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
present
time,
under
present
law.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
it
has
not.
the
court
below
misread
a
decision
called
national
resources
defense
counsel
against
sec
in
out
of
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
there
is
a
case
--
that
case
held
that
sec
in
adopting
regulations
dealing
with
more
environmental
disclosure
would
have
to
adhere
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
make
fuller
disclosure
arguably
than
it
had
made.
but
there
was
no
case
holding
that
environmental
impact
statements
are
necessary
in
each
sec
filing.
in
fact,
if
we
to
had
to
have
them,
the
impact
on
the
nation’s
capital
markets
would
be
just
devastating
because
the
number
of
securities
issues
that
are
involved.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
has
not
been
held.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
even
the
district
of
columbia
case
didn’t
go
that
far,
your
honor,
and
no
case
to
my
knowledge
has
gone
that
far.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
i
know
of,
no
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no.
what
has
been
going
on
is
a
very
elaborate
rule
making
proceeding
before
the
sec
with
respect
to
how
much
additional
disclosure
is
necessarily.
that’s
still
going
on.
there
have
been
hearings
and
the
proposals,
but
certainly
there’ve
been
no
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
environmental
disclosure
which
of
course,
is
a
different
question
than
we’ve
got
here.
the
plaintiffs
here
did
not
go
to
the
administrator
and
say,
“amend
your
regulations
to
require
more
environmental
disclosures
in
statements
of
record
and
property
reports.”
thank
you.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
one
very
brief
point,
your
honor.
we
want
to
make
clear
that
if
the
developer
completely
discloses
all
the
facts
required
under
the
act
in
the
regulation,
the
administrator
must
allow
his
disclosure
statement
to
become
effective.
he
can’t
suspend
it
for
any
reason
except
inaccuracy
or
incompleteness.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
both
the
statute
and
the
regulation
both
do
--
yes
the
regulations
at
24
cfr
17
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
they
are
in
the
papers,
you
have
to
code
of
federal
regulations.
it’s
24
code
of
federal
regulations
1710.105
and
they
described
in
detail,
the
contents
of
the
statements
of
record.
among
those
items
that
affect
the
environment
would
be.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
1710.105.
24
cfr
1710.105.
among
the
factors
that
bear
on
the
environment
are

local

including
such
things
as

mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
the
statute,
specifically
that
the
12
items
that
are
specifically
required
to
be
included
in
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
this
is
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
i
was
looking
at
the
petition
but
it’s
in
the
brief
also.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
at
4
(a)
or
5
(a)
it’s
section
1406
on
page

(a),
it’s
15

--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it’s
subsections
--
subsection
2
which
requires
a
description
of
topography
and
subsection
3,
we’ll,
that's
the
title.
subsection
5
in
particular
which
calls
for
a
description
of
noise
and
safety
and
other
facilities,
municipalities
and
in
these
are
expanded.
it’s
2
in
5
as
expanded
by
the
regulations.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
and
going
back
to
my
point,
if
the
developer
discloses
all
of
information
required
by
the
statute
and
regulations,
then
the
administrator
has
no
choice
but
to
allow
his
registration
statement
to
go
into
effect
and
that
doesn’t
matter
--
and
that
is
so
regardless
of
the
quality
of
the
development.
whether
it’s
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
they
could
disclose
it’s
noisy,
they
could
disclose
that
the
development
is
under
water
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that’s
right.
as
long
they
disclose
the
truth,
the
facts
required
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i’m
sorry.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
to
do
the
impact
statement.
that
is
right.
the
only
thing
they
could
do
would
be
to
ask
that
the
regulations
be
broadened,
to
include
more
environmental
information
for
the
use
of
all
interested
parties.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
then
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
as
long
as
they
were
not
purchasers,
their
only
remedy
would
be
to
complain
to
hud
and
to
the
attorney
general
alleging
that
there
had
been
violations
to
the
act
and
the
regulations.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
they
could
at
least
write
a
complaint
in
as
any
citizen
can.
they
would
not
have
any
standing
to
bring
a
legal
proceeding
as
such.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
purchaser
also
has
certainly.
if
they
were
purchasers,
if
they
bought
a
lot,
then
they
would
have
standing
to
revoke,
to
sue
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
certain
damages.
these
are
contained
in
the
act
and
of
course,
to
complain
of
the
violation.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
their
remedy
would
only
be
to
go
to
hud
and
say,
you
ought
to
have
better
regulations
and
petition
for
better
regulations
which
is
at
these
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
any
legal
proceeding.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
there’s
no
fee
but
we
do
depend
on
in
the
enforcement
and
then
there
have
been
criminal
actions
brought
under
the
statute,
where
there
has
been
misrepresentation.
