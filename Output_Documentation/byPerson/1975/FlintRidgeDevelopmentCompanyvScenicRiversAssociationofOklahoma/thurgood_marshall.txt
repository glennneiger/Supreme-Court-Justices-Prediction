to
every
construction
in
the
country,
doesn’t
it?
justice

marshall
if
it
involves
money,
it
involves
a
major
federal
intervention
because
you
get
money
through
the
interstate
commerce,
isn’t
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that’s
your
only
basis
for
this
federal
major
--
major
federal
intervention.
that’s
the
only
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
particular
case,
what
was
the
major
federal
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
all?
justice

these
cases
are
here
on
writ
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
they
present
the
question
of
whether
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
must
file
an
environmental
impact
statement
pursuant
to
the
national
environment
policy
act,
prior
to
allowing
a
disclosure
statement
filed
with
the
secretary
pursuant
to
the
interstate
land
sales
full
disclosure
act
in
order
to
become
effective.
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
oklahoma
ruled
that
the
secretary
must
file
such
a
statement
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
nepa
instructs
all
federal
agencies
to
comply
with
it's
impact
statement
requirement
“to
the
fullest
extent
possible.”
where
a
clear
and
unavoidable
conflict
in
statutory
authority
exists,
however,
nepa
must
yield.
here
we
find
that
the
secretary
cannot
comply
with
a
duty
to
allow
disclosure
statements
to
become
effective
within
30
days
after
the
filing
and
the
same
--
and
simultaneously
prepare
an
environment
impact
statement.
accordingly
the
impact
statement
requirement
is
inapplicable
to
this
situation.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
these
cases
are
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
