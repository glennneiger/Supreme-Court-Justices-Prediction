mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
what
is
major
federal
action?
that’s
the
issue
in
this
case.
congress
commanded
all
agencies
of
the
federal
government
in
those
instances
where
it
proposed
to
take
action
which
as
major
federal
action
which
has
a
significant
effect
upon
the
environment
that
it
must
prepare
an
impact
statement.
this
impact
statement
must
be
prepared
by
the
agency
prior
to
the
time
that
it
undertakes
the
action.
the
impact
statement
itself
is
a
detailed
written
statement
prepared
by
the
agency.
it
describes
the
impact
of
the
proposed
action
upon
the
environment.
it
describes
what
alternatives
there
are
to
the
proposed
action.
the
purpose
of
the
impact
statement
is
to
be
used
by
agency
as
a
tool
to
asses
that
in
its
decision
making
processes.
in
that
connection
the
agency
weighs
the
impact
of
the
proposed
action
upon
the
environment.
it
measures
the
benefits
of
the
action
against
the
burdens
on
the
environment.
most
importantly,
what
the
purpose
of
the
impact
statement
is,
is
that
it
gives
to
the
agency
the
power
to
take
in
to
consideration
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
permit
the
project
to
go
forward,
whether
it
should
modify
the
project
or
whether
or
not
it
should
stop
the
project
altogether
because
the
environmental
consequences
are
so
severe.
now,
if
the
agency
under
its
organic
act
doesn’t
have
the
power
to
permit
the
project
to
go
ahead,
to
modify
it,
to
reduce
the
environmental
impact
or
to
stop
the
agency’s
action
altogether,
then
there's
no
really
no
use
or
purpose
fulfilled
in
the
preparation
of
the
statement
because
it's
meaningless.
now,
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
agency
has
the
power
to
permit
action
to
go
forward,
to
modify
the
proposed
action
or
to
stop
it
altogether,
you
have
to
look
to
the
organic
act
under
which
the
agency
was
created
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
agency
has
such
authority
and
powers
under
the
act.
in
this
case
when
you
look
at
ilsa,
you
will
see
that
ilsa
was
passed
by
congress
and
dealt
with
the
subject
of
sales.
in
the
spectrum
of
land
development,
sales
is
at
the
very
end
because
what
has
preceded
sales
is
land
acquisition,
the
planning,
the
financing
and
to
a
substantial
extent,
development
and
development
afterwards.
all
of
those
things
which
preceded
sales
hud
has
no
involvement
in
and
has
no
authority
and
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
developer’s
activities.
take
for
instance
flint
ridge
in
this
case.
flint
ridge
acquired
this
property
in
february
of
1973.
no
federal
approval
was
required
by
hud
in
connection
with
that
acquisition.
when
flint
ridge
was
doing
its
planning
and
when
it
was
doing
all
of
the
things
that
had
to
be
done
to
comply
with
the
state
and
local
laws
of
oklahoma,
there
was
no
approval
required
by
hud
in
connection
with
those
approvals.
and
when
flint
ridge
obtained
it's
financing,
no
federal
approval
was
required
by
hud
in
connection
with
that.
and
more
importantly
at
the
time
that
flint
ridge
began
it's
construction
which
was
in
1973,
which
was
more
than
six
months
prior
to
the
time
that
hud
that
it
filed
it's
registration
statement
with
hud.
it
actually
undertook
its
construction
activities
and
by
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case,
it
has
spent
over
$3.5
million
in
construction
on
this
development.
and
in
connection
with
all
of
this
expenditure
of
money,
all
of
the
construction
activities,
flint
ridge
did
not
have
to
obtain
the
approval
of
hud.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
it's
a
second
home
residential
subdivision,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
the
first
--
this
was
the
so
called
first
phase
and
there
was
a
1014
lots
in
the
first
phase.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
the
property
was
being
sold
as
vacant
lots
to
purchasers.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
of
course
what
happens
in
this
type
of
a
development,
the
developer
never
knows
beforehand
how
many
of
the
lots
within
the
subdivision
that
he
is
going
to
sell
with
houses
on
them.
how
many
he
will
be
selling
with
contracts
to
build
houses,
how
many
he
will
be
selling
to
other
developers
and
by
the
way
all
of
those
types
are
exempt
sales
under
the
act.
so,
what
a
developer
really
does
is
that
he
registers
all
of
these
lots
to
keep
his
options
open.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
not
in
the
record
but
what
is
in
the
record
is
that
between
july
of
‘73
and
july
of
‘74,
over
$3.5
million
had
been
spent
in
actual
construction
of
the
development.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
no
these
were
just
roads,
a
water
treatment
plant,
improvements,
and
clubhouses,
those
types
of
improvements.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
not
the
individual
units.
so,
we
have
a
situation
that
if
hud
doesn’t
have
any
control
over
the
development
activities
of
the
developer
which
really
is
what
causes
the
impact
upon
the
environment,
then
hud
should
not
be
required
to
do
an
environmental
impact
statement.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
well
if
you
use
the
term
peril--
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
is
your
honor
talking
about
when
you
say
at
his
peril
--
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
that’s
correct
but
we
say
erroneously
so.
mr.
f.
paul
thieman,
jr.
yes,
we
have
been
held
--
i’d
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
