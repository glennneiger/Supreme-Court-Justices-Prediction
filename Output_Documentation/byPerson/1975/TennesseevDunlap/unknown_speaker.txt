unknown
speaker
what
would
the
level
of
the
decision
not
to
permit
reenlistment
made?
unknown
speaker
this
unit
would
be
what?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
a
unit
is
it?
unknown
speaker
like
a
company?
unknown
speaker
most
of
them
are
major.
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
in
fact
in
this
case
–
he
did
in
fact
in
this
case
consult
some
sort
of
advisory
group
of
other
officers,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
review
of
the
initial
decision
whatever
level
it
is
made,
whether
it
is
captain
or
major.
unknown
speaker
the
review
of
that
not
of
right,
the
guardsman
has
no--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
--
the
tennessee
guard
unit
would
be
the
adjutant
general
that
he
would
be
on
the
top
--
unknown
speaker
could
it
get
to
him?
unknown
speaker
not
of
right
as
far
as
the
guardsman
is
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
mr.
shipley,
as
i
understand
it
that
a
reenlistment
confers
no
more
rights
upon
the
applicant
for
reenlistment
than
with
an
applicant
for
original
enlistment.
unknown
speaker
you
are
at
zero.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
--
go
on
but
so
far
as
the
rights
of
the
applicant
go,
they
are--
unknown
speaker
they
are
zero
and
that
is
your
submission
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
say
that
the
decision
to
refuse
enlistment
or
reenlistment
is
wholly
discretionary,
not
subject
to
review
on
any
ground?
unknown
speaker
what
if—
unknown
speaker
certainly
a
big
absence,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
that
if
there
was
a
statutory,
if
the
statute
regulating
this
technician’s
job
expressly
said
that
you
cannot
refuse
to
reenlist
because
of
your
job
performance.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
argument
here
is
that
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
is
what
the
statute
means.
and
but
you
say
that
they
could
refuse
reenlistment,
but
even
if
whoever
refused
reenlistment
said
expressly,
the
reason
i
am
refusing
reenlistment
is
because
we
are
unsatisfied
with
your
performance
as
a
technician.
unknown
speaker
do
we
not
have
to
judge
the
case
on
this
basis?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
thought
as
i
understand
it,
thought
that
the
real
reason
they
were
refusing
to
reenlist
was
that
they
were
unsatisfied
with
his
job
performance.
unknown
speaker
and,
i
thought
your
position
was
that
even
if
that
is
the
case,
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
you,
you
would
agree
that
if
he
were
terminated
or
refused
reenlistment
for
a
constitutionally
impermissible
reason
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
some
hearing.
unknown
speaker
supposing,
in
other
words
if
the
purpose
was
to
deny
him
a
constitutional
right.
he
would
be
entitled
to
some
kind
of
hearing.
unknown
speaker
supposing
he
has
alleged,
and
i
think
one
might
read
his
complaint
this
way,
that
the
statute
gave
him
a
right
not
to
be
discharged
except
for
a
cause
which
gave
him
a
property
interest
in
his
job
and
that
entitled
him
constitutionally
to
a
hearing
in
connection
with
the
discharge.
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
refusal
to
reenlist
was
to
deny
him
his
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing
in
connection
with
his
discharge.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
if
he
were
terminated
for
any
reason
other
than
failure
to
continue
a
status
in
the
reserve
that
he
would
be
entitled
constitutionally
to
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
he
still
has
the
right
to
a
hearing?
that
is
my
question.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
mr.
shipley,
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
question.
if
he
were
terminated
for
a
reason
other
than
failure
to
obtain
reenlistment,
would
you
agree
that
he
does
or
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing?
i
understand
he
has
the
right
--
an
administrative
right
to
hearing
but
does
he
also
have
a
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
necessary,
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
situation
here
is
like
the
non
ten
year
teacher,
let
us
say,
who
is
hired
for
a
year
and
during
the
term
during
that
year,
he
might
be
entitled
under
his
contract
to
a
hearing
if
his
contract
was
terminated
before
the
year
is
over.
but
at
the
end
of
the
year,
they
might
refuse
renewal
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
for
a
reason
that
if
may
during
the
term
would
entitle
him
to
a
hearing
but
which
at
the
end
of
the
term
does
not.
unknown
speaker
it
is
possible
that
the
technician,
are
essentially
military
responsibilities,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
not
have
this?
he
would
be
on
active
duty
with
doing
the
very
same
thing
he
is
now
doing
as
a
civilian.
unknown
speaker
does
it
suffice
this?
these
men
from
a
cadre,
in
the
event
we
suddenly
had
a
war.
they
trained
and
enlarged
the
group
doing
the
same
kind
of
things
for
the
military
and
that
he
does
on
weekends
as
a
weekend
warrior,
the
same
things
he
does
during
the
week
but
he
is
definitely
military
on
weekends.
unknown
speaker
doing
the
same
thing
as
he
is
doing
during
the
weekend
as
a
civilian.
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
have
this
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
that
their
job?
unknown
speaker
general
shipley,
can
i
put
my
question
just
a
little
differently?
it
is
a
bit
of
different
question.
supposing
he
asked
for
a
statement
of
reasons
for
not
being
allowed
to
reenlist
and
he
received
a
letter
which
said,
one,
we
have
heard
from
our
technical
people
and
they
think
you
are
kind
of
an
average
technician
and
they
would
like
to
get
rid
of
you,
and
two,
they
do
not
want
to
take
the
trouble
to
have
the
hearing
so
we
have
decided
just
not
to
let
you
reenlist.
would
that
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
my
hypothetical
letter
is
written
by
a
military
man
saying
this
is
why
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
reenlist.
would
you
say
that
is
perfectly
alright?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
argument
was
that
the
answer
to
that
question
you
just
asked
is
yes.
is
is
simple,
yes
or
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
and
that
he
would
not
get
a
hearing
even
for
that
expressed
reason.
i
thought
that
is
the
position
you--
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
the
question
a
while
ago,
if
they
told
him
expressly
that
the
reason
they
were
refusing
reenlistment
was
because
of
his
poor
performance
as
a
technician,
what
would
there
be
any
review,
judicial
review?
and
you
said,
no
there
would
not
be
judicial
review.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
the
still
the
same
answer,
mr.
justice
steven?
is
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
only
additional
fact
is
they
say,
(a)
we
understand
you
are
not
a
very
good
technician,
and
(b)
we
do
not
want
to
be
bothered
with
a
lot
of
hearings.
so
instead
of
having
a
hearing
in
the
technician
side
of
the
coin,
we
are
simply
not
going
to
let
you
reenlist.
do
you
think
that
is
perfectly
alright?
unknown
speaker
and
they
might
put
a
p.s.
on
the
letter
and
you
were
lucky
that
we
waited
this
long.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
waited
that
long,
they
could
have
removed
him
as
a
technician
only
with
a
hearing.
during
his
term
of
enlistment,
he
would
have
10
years
in
the
national
guard.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
supposedly,
reenlistment
came
up,
reenlistment
was
refused
and
he
was
notified
expressly
that
we
are
not
reenlisting
you
because
we
think
you
are
only
an
average
technician,
and
we
can
do
better.
we
are
not
saying
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
your
performance
in
the
sense
that
we
could
have
fired
you
during
the
term
but
we
just
think
we
can
do
better
so
we
are
going
to
not
reenlist
you.
unknown
speaker
but
as
only
if
you
think
--
it
is
only
if
you
think
that
they
are
firing
him
because
of
some
reason
--
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
write
another
fellow
and
say
the
reason
we
are
not
reenlisting
you
is
because
of
your
performance
on
a
certain
day
which
is,
it
was
--
you
just
were
not
a
good
technician
on
that
day.
we
could
have
fired
you
then
for
a
cause
but
we
just
waited
till
now.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
they
did
not
go
ahead
and
do
it
but
they
just
waited
until
the
end
of
the
term.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that
seventeen-and-half
years?
unknown
speaker
just
to
make
sure,
i
understand.
does
the
record
show
that
he
is
17
years
old
or
not?
unknown
speaker
anything
before
us
showed
this.
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer
is
no
then?
unknown
speaker
the
brief
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
is
it
not?
because
some
mention
of
the
opinion
that
sixth
circuits
is
not
there
or
not?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
position
is
that
once
a
member
of
the
national
guard
becomes
a
technician,
he
then
can
never
be
denied
the
right
to
reenlist,
or
the
assertive
right
to
reenlist
without
a
prior
hearing.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
how
does
one
determine
this?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
to
my
question
then
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
and,
that
is
once
the
status
of
technician
is
obtained,
it
may
be
the
first
month,
he
is
a
member
of
the
national
guard.
from
then
on,
he
can
never
be
denied
the
right
to
reenlist
without
a
prior
evidentiary
hearing.
unknown
speaker
the
adjutant
general
just
said
you
are
the
worst
soldier
we
have
ever
had.
you
are
totally
incompetent.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
that
was
a
sham?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
he
did
not
believe
that
that
was
the
real
reason.
the
point
is
that,
that
is
what
you
told
me
but
i
know
the
real
reason
you
fired
me
or
would
not
be
reenlisted
because
you
did
not
like
my
work
as
a
technician.
would
he
always
be
free
to
make
that
allegation
and
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
allegation
regardless
of
what
the
commanding
officer
said
to
him.
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
always
would
have
an
opportunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
his
allegation
be
exactly
what
you
put
in
this
complaint,
but
the
real
reason
you
said
that
is
you
did
not
like
my
work—
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
like
me
at
hearing.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
would
you
assert
that
he
had
any
ground
for
complaint
upon
denial
of
reenlistment?
unknown
speaker
just
as
an
ordinary
national
guard.
unknown
speaker
on
the
fact
that
your
client
is
a
technician
or
was
a
technician.
unknown
speaker
before
one
may
retain
the
position
of
technician,
he
must
be
a
member
of
the
national
guard.
unknown
speaker
how
many
days
a
week
as
a
technician?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
two?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)military.
unknown
speaker
and
are
doing
the
same
functions
that
he
performed
during
the
week
as
a
civilian
technician?
unknown
speaker
and
then,
the
commander
said
we
are
not
allowing
you
to
reenlist
because
one
weekend
in
the
month
you
performed
so
poorly,
we
decided
that
you
would
not
reenlist.
you
are
not
permitted
to
reenlist,
then
what
is
the
situation.
unknown
speaker
that
day,
performing
military
duty,
you
did
not
perform
satisfactorily
and
for
that
reason,
we
are
not
permitting
you
to
reenlist.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
been
very
simple
then
instead
of
denying
him
reenlistment.
as
they
did
--
as
that
merely
said,
you
deny
a
reenlistment
because
on
one
weekend
of
the
month
that
you
have
to
report
as
a
military
person,
you
did
not
perform
satisfactorily.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
think
a
u.s.
attorney
is
appointed
four
years.
suppose
the
four-year
period
expires
and
he
is
not
reappointed,
is
he
entitled
to
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
the
u.s
attorney,
normally
is
appointed
by
the
executive.
sometimes
if
there
is
a
vacancy
where
the
district
court
steps
in
but
i
am
just
speaking
of
the
usual
situation.
unknown
speaker
if
i
understand
you,
are
you
saying
that
the
u.s.
attorney
can
acquire
some
kind
of
tenure
at
his
job
beyond
his
period
of
appointment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
den,
are
you
familiar
with
roth,
i
take
it
at
board
of
regents
versus
roth?
unknown
speaker
are
you
aware
that
there
in
that
case
when
it
had
been
on
the
seventh
circuit
before
it
got
here.
although
roth
had
no
claim
of
entitlement
to
be
rehired,
it
was
simply
about
ten
year
at
will.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
as
a
prophylactic
matter
to
make
sure
that
the
refusal
to
rehire
was
not
for
impermissible
purposes.
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
either
in
federal
court
or
administrative
and
this
court
disapproved
that.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
that
there
is
a
prophylactic
necessity
for
this,
we
are
going
to
make
sure
that
it
was
not
improper
reasons
as
very
much
to
the
position
of
the
seventh
circuit
took
in
roth
and
that
was
not
followed
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
denton,
that
argument
does
not
--
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
fact
is
other
than
as
being
a
technician
and
i
thought
i
understood
your
answer
mr.
justice
powell
by
saying
relied
entirely
on
the
status
as
a
technician.
and
if
that
is
true,
i
do
not
see
whether
it
makes
any
difference
whether
one
year
or
seventeen-and-half
years.
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
any
--
would
you
say
he
had
a
claim
if
you
were
not
a
technician.
unknown
speaker
or
if
you
rely
entirely
on
the
status
as
a
technician,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
was
in
the
service
for
17
years
or
only
for
six
weeks.
unknown
speaker
yes.
your
point
being
that
when
his
term
of
reenlistment
comes
up,
his
status
as
a
technician
entitles
him
to
a
special
protection
but
it
seems
to
be
that
is
completely
independent
of
the
seventeen-and-half
year
point
and
vice
versa.
unknown
speaker
does
seventeen-and-half
years
give
him
expectancy
under
roth
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
then
he
does
not
need
to
be
a
technician.
unknown
speaker
i
have
to
confess,
i
am
confused.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
not
allege
that
here,
did
you,
in
your
complaint?
you
did
not
allege
that
the
refusal
to
allow
reenlistment
was
because
of
race,
religion,
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
he
right
in
the
roth
case
and
his
enlistment
is
up
and
he
is
asking
for
a
new
enlistment.
unknown
speaker
he
had
been
allowed
to
be
reenlist
whether
it
would
have
been
a
continuous
situation.
unknown
speaker
both
in
the
national
guard
and
as
a
technician.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
term
enlistment
in
the
national
guard?
i
do
not--
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
years,
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
of
the
applicant
or
of
the
particular
unit
or
what?
unknown
speaker
the
normal
term
is
six
years,
is
it
like
that?
unknown
speaker
can
you
know
the
opinion
written
for
the
court
of
appeals
is
written
by
a
former
member
of
the
court
of
military
appeals?
