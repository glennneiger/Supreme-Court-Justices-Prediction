justice
thurgood
marshall
as
you
have
said,
this
is
civil
service.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
then
cannot
fire
--
then
he
will?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can
not
fire
him
at
will?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that,
if
they
want
to
fire
him,
and
they
are
not
willing
to
go
through
the
normal
firing
processes,
they
just
refuse
the
letter
and
reenlist.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
let
us
go
back
and
find
out
if
there
is
some
hanky-panky
on
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
the
court
says
go
find
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
says,
go
find
that,
whether
the
reason
to
fire
him
--
not
to
let
him
reenlist
was
not
to
deprive
him
of
his
job.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
wrong
with
finding
that
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
this
case,
let
me
just
a
man
that
has
the
status
of
the
standing
job,
the
civil
service
job
i
saw
him
in
one
of
his
limited
jobs.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
not
apply
to
the
other
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
give
him
civil
service
status,
this
is
what
you
are
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
final
question,
the
man,
the
adjutant
general
is
in
charge
of
him
as
a
specialist,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
technician.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
responsible
for
him
as
a
guardsman.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
civilian
judgment.
the
only
trouble
with
this
case
is
the
same
man
as
both
to
civilian
and
the
military.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says
while
i
got
the
hat
on
as
supervisor
of
this
man.
i
cannot
fire
him
without
a
hearing.
so,
i
put
my
other
hat
on
and
fire
him
without
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
has
been
in
the
guard
since
17-and-half
years
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
the
record
shows
how
much
time
he
served
in
the
national
guard.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
do
not
have
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
taking
out
the
decision
that
the
sixth
circuit,
where
is
there
in
the
testimony,
evidence,
affidavits,
or
anything
else
at
the
period
of
time
that
he
was
in
the
national
guard.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
no
testimony--
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure,
how
long
he
was
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
brief
is
not
evidence
to
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
us
take
this
seriously.
now,
this
man’s
enlistment
period
is
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
no
longer
a
technician.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
if
he
comes
back,
what
is
the
difference
between
when
he
recently
applied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
there
is
a
(inaudible)
between
the
ending
and
the
reenlistment,
is
it
not?
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
particular
case
does,
i
mean
is
not
he
just
right
in
the
roth
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
mean
time,
he
is
not
a
technician.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
requires
us
to
consider
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
interpreted
the
provision
of
the
national
guard
technicians
act
of
1968.
that
act
provided
that
the
a
national
guard
technician
was
a
full-time
civilian
employee
of
the
national
guard
must
be
a
member
of
the
guard
and
that
a
technician
who
was
separated
from
the
guard,
“shall
be
properly
separated
from
his
technician
employment.”
the
act
also
provides
that
a
technician
may
at
anytime
be
separated
from
his
technician
employment
for
cause.
the
respondent
was
denied
re-enlistment
in
the
guard
when
his
term
of
enlistment
expired
and
it
was
then
notified
that
his
employment
as
a
technician
will
be
terminated
because
he
was
no
longer
member
of
the
guard.
the
respondent
brought
this
suit
to
challenge
the
denial
of
his
request
for
re-enlistment
and
the
termination
of
his
employment
as
a
technician.
the
dispositive
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
act's
provision
that
a
technician
may
discharged
for
cause
and
any
application
to
a
case
in
which
the
termination
of
a
technician's
employment
follows
is
separation
on
the
guard.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
it
does
not,
and
since
the
court
of
appeals'
order
is
to
the
contrary,
the
judgment
of
that
court
is
reversed.
