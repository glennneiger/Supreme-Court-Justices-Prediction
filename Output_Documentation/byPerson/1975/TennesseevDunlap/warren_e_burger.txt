chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-95,
tennessee
against
dunlap.
mr.
shipley,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
national
guard
just
concludes
that
he
is
not
up
to
par
in
terms
of
his
technical
competence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
--
his
technician
in
essence
and
they
have
two
choices.
are
you
telling
us
they
can
dismiss
him
from
that
job
for
a
cause
or
they
can
just
simply
wait
until
his
enlistment
expires
and
then
decline
to
reenlist
him
and
he
is
automatically
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
these
two
evidences
to
terminate
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
it
is
for
that
reason,
from
your
point
of
view,
that
there
is
nothing
that
for
any
court
to
review
because
they
can
do
this
for
any
reason
they
desire.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
and
the
statute
says
he
has
that
right.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
creates
a
right
to
a
hearing
for
an
administrative
dismissal
as
a
technician--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
a
cause.
for
all
--
i
suppose
it
is
your
position
and
for
all
we
know,
military
minds
said
this
man
is
not
a
suitable
man
for
the
military.
we
do
not
want
him
in
the
guard.
maybe
he
is
a
fine
technician
but
he
is
not
a
good
guardsman
and
therefore--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
there
is
no
review
of
that
kind
from
your--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
denton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
decision
is
not
a
military
decision
if
the
commander
reaches
the
conclusion
that
his
performance
as
a
technician
is
not
supportive
of
the
military
mission
of
the
unit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
answered
the
question
both
ways.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
this
right--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
says
as
an
enlistment
in
the
guard
is
the
base
of
the
employment.
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
statute.
they
read
this;
it
is
simply
saying
that
if
you
terminate
him
within
the
six-year
enlistment
period,
you
have
got
to
give
him
a
hearing
or
perhaps
alternately
a
dismissal
by
a
court
marshall.
i
suppose
that
could
be
done
too,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
man
could
be
terminated
within
the
six
years
if
he
were
found
guilty
of
some
offense
by
a
court
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
administrative
appeal
on
the
other
side,
would
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
why
can
not
this
statute
be
read
as
meaning
only
that
if
he
is
terminated
within
the
period
of
his
enlistment,
he
gets
an
administrative
hearing
but
that
when
his
enlistment
expires,
that
is
the,
and
not
renewed,
that
is
the
end
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
does
the
statute
--
why
cannot
the
statute
be
read
as
meaning
simply
but
if
he
is
terminated
during
the
six-year
period
of
his
enlistment,
then
they
must
give
him
the
administrative
hearing.
but
if
he
is
not
reenlisted,
he
is
in
the
same
posture
as
a
man
who
just
said
he
did
not
want
to
reenlist
but
he
wanted
to
keep
his
job.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
disposition
in
number
75-95,
tennessee
against
dunlap
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
