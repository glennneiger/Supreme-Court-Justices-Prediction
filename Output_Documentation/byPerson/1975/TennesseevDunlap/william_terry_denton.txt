mr.
william
terry
denton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
that
at
the
outset
of
this
argument
that
i
should
point
out
that
court
of
appeals
correctly
noted
that
one
must
look
not
to
the
nature
of
the
decision
or
must
look
to
the
nature
of
the
decision
and
not
the
mere
identity
of
the
decision
maker.
this
is
where
we
feel
that
the
petitioners
were
incorrect
and
that
they
are
alleging
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
a
military
commander
who
made
the
decision
that
it
was
a
military
decision.
our
allegations
are
to
the
effect
that
it
was
a
military
commander
who
made
the
decision
but
he
made
for
a
nonmilitary
purpose.
that
purpose
being
a
sham
to
remove,
to
respond
from
this
technician’s
employment.
mr.
william
terry
denton
no
sir.
on
that
instance
it
would
be--
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
would
be
a
military
decision
on
that
instance
but
whether
he
wants
to
remove
a
man
for
other
than
a
military
purpose,
this
would
be
for
benefit.
to
answer
your
question,
his
decision
on
that
instance
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
military.
mr.
william
terry
denton
well,
it
can
work
both
ways.
he
is
capable
of
working
both
ways,
that
is
why
you
must
look
to
the
nature
of
the
decision
and
not
merely
the
decision
maker.
mr.
william
terry
denton
in
that
instance,
i
feel
that
the
commander’s
decision
would
then
be
within
the
purview
of
the
military
decision.
mr.
william
terry
denton
if
they
had
an
ability
to
fire
the
technician
for
a
cause
on
any
day,
then
i
think
under
the
dictates
of
congress
and
congress
in
providing
the
portion
under
provision
in
the
statute
for
removal
for
a
cause,
then
they
must
remove
for
a
cause.
mr.
william
terry
denton
then
i
think
it
is
impermissible
conduct.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
do
not
think
congress
ever
intended
for
them
to
have
this
dual
capacity.
i
think
this
is
something--
mr.
william
terry
denton
a
requisite.
it
is
a
requisite.
but
a
man
could
also
have
an
outstanding
military
performance
record
and
could
be
dismissed
by
a
military
commander.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
am
sorry–
mr.
william
terry
denton
yes,
your
honor.
he
could.
if
he
were
court
marshalled
and
dismissed
with
his
service
as
a
result
of
court
marshall,
he
could
be.
mr.
william
terry
denton
no,
your
honor.
he
would
not.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
do
not
think,
i
follow
your
honor,
your
question
here.
mr.
william
terry
denton
the
statute
deals
specifically
where
the
technician’s
employment,
does
not
deal
with
the
military
aspect
of
which
the
technician’s
employment
does
rest
upon
the
military
aspect.
the
commander
as
far
as
a
sham
could,
for
political
purposes
or
through
friendships,
be
designed
to
place
someone
else
in
the
technician’s
position
and
therefore,
refuse
reenlistment
on
that
basis.
mr.
william
terry
denton
according
to
our,
it
may
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
because
it
would
involve
or
involve
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
maybe
not
constitutionally
impermissible
and
be
statutory
and
regulatory
impermissible.
mr.
william
terry
denton
our
argument
would
be
that
if
they
desire
to
remove
the
respondent
from
his
technician’s
employment,
they
should
have
done
so
for
a
cause,
had
done
so
through
the
statute.
mr.
william
terry
denton
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
does
not
say,
you
can
deny
a
reenlistment.
the
statute
only
deals
with
the
removal
for
a
cause.
i
do
not
think
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
ever
meant
to
give
the
national
guard,
the
means
of
removal
for
other
than
cause.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
do
not
think
you
can
read
that
into
the
statute,
i
think
that
reading
into
the
sixth
circuit’s
decision
that
this
comes
from
that
be
permissible
or
be
necessary
to
give
them
a
hearing,
especially
in
this
case
where
the
commander
convened
the
board
which
we
allege
was
to
hear
charges
and
statements
against
the
respondent.
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
be
allowed
to
reenlist
then
the
respondent,
--
the
commander
convenes
the
board
request
it
to
be
allowed
to
appear
before
this
board.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
think
so,
(inaudible)
the
statute
and
regulations.
mr.
william
terry
denton
in
part
on
the
constitution
and
also
regulations,
also
statutory.
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
mean
that
once
the
commander
convened
the
board
of
all
sorts
to
hear
charges
and
statements
and
his
refusal
to
allow
the
respondent
to
appear
before
this
board,
also
his
refusal
to
furnish
the
respondent
with
a
copy
of
any
charges
or
statements,
that
was
constitutionally
impermissible.
mr.
william
terry
denton
because
it
denied
the
respondent
his
right
to
procedural
due
process.
it
had
attached
a
statement
to
him
before
other
people
who
were
passing
upon
his
conduct
and
his
performance.
mr.
william
terry
denton
well,
quite
often,
under
the
law,
there
are
not
public
statements
or
public
hearings
possibly
held
where
people
have
been
entitled
procedural
due
process.
there
are
different
methods
of
denying
a
person’s
procedural
due
process.
mr.
william
terry
denton
well,
most
certainly
we
do
and
it
was
damaging
to
the
respondent
and
that
he
lost
his
technician’s
position.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
think
the
mere
statement
of
saying
that
it
was
not
in
best
interest
of
the
tennessee
international
guard
to
allow
his
reenlistment
especially
in
a
lot
of
facts,
his
being
having
seventeen-and-half
years
of
employment
or
military
expertise
employment.
mr.
william
terry
denton
your
honor,
as
general
shipley
correctly
bought
before
this
court’s
attention
was
first
raised
in
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
william
terry
denton
you
mean
his
military
record
or?
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
would
only
be
in
the
brief;
it
would
not
be
in
the
technical
record
itself.
mr.
william
terry
denton
well,
a
brief,
we
put
brief
in
the
--
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
believe
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
terry
denton
actual
credible
time,
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
the
national
guard
time.
all
the
national
guard
time
is
seventeen
and
half
year
as
credible
time.
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
would
only
be
possibly
on
the
record
as
far
as
the
decision
of
sixth
circuit.
mr.
william
terry
denton
of
course
there
is
no
testimony.
the
only
thing
we
rely
on
is--
mr.
william
terry
denton
be
the
complaint.
the
complaint
was
dismissed
without
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
of
course
from
there,
there
have
been
briefs
filed.
mr.
william
terry
denton
no,
your
honor.
other
than
the
briefs
which
have
been
filed,
that
would
be
the
only
thing.
mr.
william
terry
denton
no,
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
mr.
william
terry
denton
he
can
not
be
if
he
is
not–the
denial
reenlistment
is
not
a
mere
sham
to
get
rid
of
him
from
this
technician’s
employment.
mr.
william
terry
denton
this
is
to
through
an
evidentiary
hearing
at
least
and
if
there
are
sufficient
allegations
in
the
complaint
then
this
is
our
contention
that
the
federal
court
should
review
at
least
to
make
a
determination
whether
or
not
it
was
the
decision
made
by
a
military
commander
for
a
nonmilitary
reason
as
noted
in
the
sixth
circuit’s
opinion.
mr.
william
terry
denton
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
terry
denton
the
answer
is
not
yes.
it
is
yes,
if
his
denial
to
reenlist
or
the
denial
to
reenlist
is
a
sham
to
get
rid
of
him
from
his
technician’s
employment.
mr.
william
terry
denton
then
that
would
be
a
military
--
purely
military
decision
and
you
have
no--
mr.
william
terry
denton
no,
your
honor
not
in
that
instance
because
it
would
be
a
military
decision
and
not
merely
a
military
decision
maker
making
decision
for
nonmilitary
purpose.
mr.
william
terry
denton
he
could.
he
could
make
that
allegation
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
sufficient
--or
made
sufficient
allegation.
mr.
william
terry
denton
he
could.
mr.
william
terry
denton
right
he
–
but
also
he
would
have
to
show
sufficient
allegations
before
the
court
would
be
willing
to
review
on
the
oral
argument.
mr.
william
terry
denton
true.
mr.
william
terry
denton
if
you
were
not
a
technician
and
merely
with
the
military
personnel.
mr.
william
terry
denton
no,
your
honor.
he
would
not
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
in
this
instance
and
if
he
was
merely
military
personnel.
mr.
william
terry
denton
right,
your
honor.
i
think
the
facts
on
the
decision
in
this
case
are
unique
to
my
client’s
type
of
employment.
it
does
not
apply
across
the
board
to
all
military
personnel.
it
applies
in
an
instance
where
you
have
civilian
technician’s
employment
based
upon
military
employment.
mr.
william
terry
denton
that
is
correct.
we
have
no
argument
with
that.
that
is
by
operation
of
law.
if
he
loses
his
guard
membership,
he
loses
his
technician’s
employment.
mr.
william
terry
denton
he
is
a
technician
for
five
days
a
week.
mr.
william
terry
denton
the
other
two,
he
is
off-duty.
actually,
he
has
i
think
one
weekend
per
month
that
he
performs
services
as
a
national
guardsman.
mr.
william
terry
denton
yes,
your
honor.
he
does.
mr.
william
terry
denton
basically
as
i
understand,
most
of
them
are.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
respondent
did
perform
a
very
same
function.
mr.
william
terry
denton
if
it
is
made
for
military
purpose
where
in
that
case
it
is.
mr.
william
terry
denton
but
again,
there
would
not
be
a
sham
to
get
him
out
of
his
technician’s
employment.
it
would
be
for
military
reasons.
mr.
william
terry
denton
that
is
correct
and
also--
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor.
i
believe
that
would
probably
fall
in
–-
i
do
not
recall
the
exact
name
of
the
case,
but
it
was
in
regard
henan
or
henner,
some
of
that
nature
where
the
district
court
clerks,
law
clerk
or
maybe
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
was
not
retained
by
the
federal
district
judge
and
the
court
held
that,
that
was
not
reviewable.
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
would
be
a
purely
discretionary
matter.
well,
it
might
possibly,
it
could
attach,
if
the
u.s.
attorney
had
performed
such
a
job
for
such
a
period
of
time
whereby
he
became
vested
with
a
property
interest
and
continued
employment.
this
is
another
aspect
of
this
and
we
feel
that
due
to
the
respondent’s
past
military
record,
awards,
citations,
being
within--
mr.
william
terry
denton
if
you
want
to
relate
tenure
and
a
vested
property
interest,
you
want
to
say
they
have
the
same
connotation,
yes.
i
do
not
feel
they
have
the
same
connotation,
i
think
tenure
is
being
somewhat
different
from
invested
property
interest
by
virtue
of
things
that
have
been
performance
of
the
employee-employer
relationship
or
whatever
over
the
past.
it
would
be
probably
somewhat
--
again
to
perry
versus
sindermann
where
it
was
found
that
there
was
a
ten
year
program
although
not
spelled
out
--
and
the
profession
became
vested
with
the
right
or
property
interest
and
it
continued
employment
and
renewal
of
his
contract.
mr.
william
terry
denton
yes
sir.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
think
the
distinction
in
that
case
was
that
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
mere
subjective
expectancy
was
protected
and
this
court
disagreed
saying
that
a
mere
subjective
expectancy
was
not.
i
agree
with
that.
mere
subjective
expectancy
is
not
protected.
we
think
that
the
respondent
had
a
justifiable
and
reasonable
expectancy
based
on
the
seventeen-and-half
years
of
credible
time,
based
upon
previous
reenlistments,
based
upon
military
record
and
awards
and
citations,
that
they
had
created
in
him
a
reasonable,
justifiable
expectation
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
reenlist.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
will
get
off
of
a
trial.
mr.
william
terry
denton
sorry,
i
do
not
follow,
your
honor.
mr.
william
terry
denton
if
he
were
not
a
technician
does
he
have
a
claim,
no
your
honor.
mr.
william
terry
denton
if
i
rely
on
his
status
of
the
technician?
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
is
total
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
terry
denton
his
seventeen-and-half
years
gives
him
an
expectancy
of
reenlistment.
once
he
reenlists,
then
his
technician’s
employment
continues
unless
dismissed
for
a
cause.
mr.
william
terry
denton
may
i
go
back
to
the
idea
that
once
the
board
was
convened,
the
respondent
became
closed
with
the
right
to
appear
before
this
board,
a
right
to
have
the
copy
of
the
charges
or
statements
made
against
him
and
all
of
which
were
denied
to
him.
this
was
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
also
set
forth
that
the
commander
exceeded
his
scope
of
authority
and
abused
the
authority
if
it
is
in
fact
vested
in
him.
the
complaint
listed
out
the
alleged
vested
discretional
prerogative.
our
position
is
that
this
discretional
prerogative
does
not
in
fact
exist.
if
it
does
in
fact
exist,
we
would
have
expected
the
petitioners
to
set
forth
specifically
where
that
regulation
or
statute
vesting
the
commander
with
this
discretional
prerogative
where
we
can
locate
it.
some
of
them
i
have
totally
failed
to
do,
which
were
been
very
simple
i
think
possibly
could
have
foreclosed
the
issues
in
this
case.
of
course,
we
feel
that
the
commander
overstepped
his
authority
and
abused
it,
enacted
in
arbitrary
capricious
and
unreasonable
manner
when
they
used
the
military
aspect
of
the
respondent’s
employment
in
order
to
terminate
his
technician’s
job.
also,
if
the
military
commanders
given
an
un-fretted
authority
or
prerogative
or
discretion
without
judicial
restraint
or
the
possibility
of
review
by
the
judiciary,
then
the
decision
of
the
military
commander
would
be
left
to
stand
even
if
they
were
made
on
constitutionally
impermissible
or
statutory
or
regulatory
impermissible
grounds
such
as
race,
religion,
or
sex.
to
deny
a
review
would
then
to
allow
the
military
commander
to
do
that
which
the
constitution
statute
regulation
says
he
cannot
do.
mr.
william
terry
denton
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not.
that
issue
has
not
been
raised
in
the
complaint.
we
would
say
that
once
sufficient
allegations
have
been
made
before
the
court,
allegations
of
nature
that
the
commander
has
exceeded
his
statutory
and
regulatory
authority,
that
the
commander
had
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
respondent
or
over
his
petitioner
or
plaintiff,
that
then
the
courts
could
review.
they
have
the
right
to
review
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
if
there
has
been
a
violation
and
if
this
violation--
mr.
william
terry
denton
correct.
mr.
william
terry
denton
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
terry
denton
if
he
comes
back
now?
mr.
william
terry
denton
are
you
talking
about
in
this
particular
instance,
if
the
respondent
went
back
and
asked
for
reenlist–
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
am
sorry,
i
did
not
know.
mr.
william
terry
denton
right.
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
is
done,
your
honor,
so
as
not
to
--
so
there
will
not
be
break
in
his
employment
either
as
a
military
personnel
or
a
technician.
mr.
william
terry
denton
right,
it
would
have
--
he
would
have
been--
mr.
william
terry
denton
right.
mr.
william
terry
denton
the
term
of
enlistment--
mr.
william
terry
denton
varies.
i
believe
under
the
regulations,
the
secretary
can
allow
enlistment
for
periods
as
short
as
one
half
or
six
months,
maybe
even
possibly
shorter
up
to,
i
think
a
maximum
of
six
years
at
one
time.
it
varies.
mr.
william
terry
denton
these
depend
upon
on
a
various
things
such
as
the
age
of
the
applicant,
if
he
is
eligible
within
a
matter
of
a
short
time,
possibly
six
months,
he
would
be
eligible
for
retirement
then
they
may
reenlist
him
for
six-month
period.
mr.
william
terry
denton
i
am
really
not
that
familiar
with
hr
to
be
able
to
answer
that.
again
we
feel
that
the
sixth
circuit’s
decision
does
not
go
outside
the
old
bounds
of
non-reviewability
but
actually,
as
we
enter
of
that,
they
just
set
forth
a
method
of
review,
if
there
are
sufficient
allegations.
we
feel
that
the
sixth
circuit’s
decision
is
judicially
correct
and
based
upon
--
mr.
william
terry
denton
it
was
formally–judge
duncan
was
formally
the
chief
justice
as
i
understand,
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
and
as
such,
i
would
feel
that
he
does
possess
some
expertise
in
the
military
matters.
that
is
all,
thank
you.
