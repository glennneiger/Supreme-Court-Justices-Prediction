mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
originally
brought
by
the
respondent,
the
plaintiff
below,
who
was
a
member
of
the
tennessee
national
guard.
he
also
served
in
a
dual
capacity,
a
separate
and
distinct
capacity,
as
a
national
guard
technician
which
is
a
federal
civil
service
capacity
exempt
from
the
normal
merit
competitive
civil
service
because
of
the
requirement
that
these
civil
servants
must
maintain
their
membership
in
the
tennessee
national
guard.
now,
the
plaintiff
alleged
that
he
was
wrongfully
denied
his
opportunity
to
re-enlist
in
the
tennessee
national
guard,
the
air
national
guard,
asserting
that
the
only
reason
he
was
not
allowed
to
reenlist
was
a
sham
to
deny
him
his
opportunity
for
continued
employment
as
a
technician,
as
a
national
guard
technician
under
32
usc
section
709
which
creates
the
national
guard
technician
positions.
the
complaint
argued
that
in
this
case,
the
military
commander’s
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
accept
and
offer
of
reenlistment
was
so
broad
and
vague
and
it
lacked
objective
criteria
and
was
thus
unconstitutional.
apparently,
a
delegation
of
authority
argument
rather
than
a
fourteenth
amendment
vagueness
argument,
the
denial
of
the
opportunity
then
to
reenlist
denied
the
plaintiff,
according
to
the
complaint,
his
administrative
review
which
he
would
have
had,
had
he
been
dismissed
for
cause
from
his
national
guard
technician
status.
the
complaint
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
alluding
to
the
unique
relationship
between
the
state
militia
and
one
of
its
members
and
holding
that
the
judiciary
should
avoid
interference
with
legitimate
military
matters.
the
sixth
circuit
from
which
this
--
to
which
certiorari
was
granted,
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
directing
the
district
court
to
determine
a
threshold
question.
here,
whether
or
not
this
military
decision
not
to
reenlist
this
man,
was
made
for
a
military
reason
indicating
that
you
look
to
the
military
and
it
is
of
the
decision
rather
than
to
the
fact
that
the
decision
maker
was
a
military
man.
the
national
guard
technician’s
act
of
1968
was
passed
in
order
to
create
a
federal
civil
service
position
for
national
guard
technicians.
prior
to
that
time,
they
had
been
--
they
were
called
caretakers
and
they
were
considered
to
be
state
employees.
consequently,
you
had
a
wide
diversion
of
employment
benefit,
retirement
benefits.
so
congress
in
1968
chose
to
make
these
persons
federal
civil
service
employees.
the
top
level
supervisor
of
these
federal
civil
service
employees
with
the
states
is
the
adjutant
general.
he
receives
that
authority
from
the
congressional
enactment.
because
of
the
difficulties
which
had
a
reason
previously
with
these
caretakers
not
being
military
members
of
the
particular
units
in
which
they
served
in
a
caretaker
capacity
during
their
week’s
work
as
opposed
to
their
weekend
warrior
capacity.
the
congress
imposed
the
basic
requirement
that
a
man
is
to
be
a
national
guardsman
in
order
to
hold
this
civil
service
position.
the
adjutant
general,
the
top
level
supervisor,
is
required
by
the
congressional
enactment
to
promptly
separate
from
employment,
any
technician,
who
fails
to
maintain
his
national
guard
technician.
now,
of
course,
a
technician
might
be
separated
for
cause.
he
might
be
fired
as
it
were
and
were
he
separated
for
cause,
a
right
of
appeal
would
exist
up
to
the
adjutant
general,
who
is
the
military
commander
of
the
state
national
guard.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
indicates
that
because
this
man
is
a
national
guard
technician,
he
has
a
particular
right
to
continued
membership
in
the
national
guard
thus,
apparently
grafting
the
cause
of
requirement
for
firing
a
civil
service
technician
on
to
the
prerequisite
for
national
guard
membership
to
be
maintained
in
the
first
instance.
so,
that
decision
avoided
the
issue
of
the
required
membership
in
the
national
guard.
now,
a
military
member
of
the
national
guard
can
lose
his
national
guard
status
for
variety
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
he
maybe
too
old
to
continue
to
serve
in
the
national
guard,
he
may
have
a
physical
illness
or
injury
which
would
cause
him
to
be
separated
from
the
national
guard.
he
may
simply
failed
to
reenlist.
so,
the
loss
of
guard
membership
for
any
of
those
reasons
results
on
a
consequent
virtually
automatic
loss
of
the
technician
employment.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
are
you
alluding
your
honor,
to
his
military
capacity?
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
a
guard
member
has
no
right
to
reenlist.
no
more
than
a
member
of
the
regular
service--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
your
honor,
exactly.
if
the
national
guard
chose
not
to
reenlist
him
for
whatever
purpose,
he
would
not
be
able
to
maintain
his
technician
employment.
that
is
a
decision
and
that
is
what
we
are
here
for
because
this
is
a
purely
military
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
determine
this
man’s–whether
the
military
wants
to
accept
his
offer
to
reenlist.
it
is
the
court
of
client’s
cases
which
we
considered
enlistments
have
all
alluded
to
the
fact
that
enlistment
is
a
contract
and-
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
exactly.
now,
that
is
true
in
this
case,
we
are
not
dealing
necessarily
with
employment
at
will
or
continued
employment
at
will
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
determination
that
is
made
whether
to
employ
in
the
first
instance,
a
reenlistment,
so
the
same
would
apply
whether
or
not
this
was
a
military
decision,
that
is
correct.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is
civil
service.
the
technician
status
is
civil
service.
it
is
civil
service
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
they
cannot
--
you
cannot
fire
him
for
cause.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
from
his
technician
status,
that
is
right,
your
honor,
we
agree.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor,
they
can
refuse
the
letter.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
that
would
be
right.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
allegation
of
hanky-panky
because
i
think
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
a
guard
commander
in
making
his
determination
on
whether
or
not
to
let
the
guards
to
reenlist,
might
well
consider
his
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
that
is
what
the
court
said
but
they
went
further
your
honor
in
stating
that--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
this
is
the
difficulty
it
creates
there
is
that
it
would
create
a
bifurcated
guard
capacity.
if
i
were
a
weekend
warrior
who
did
not
serve
as
a
national
guard
technician,
then
i
would
not
have
this
additional
right
to
maintain
continued
membership
in
the
national
guard,
but
if
on
the
other
hand,
i
was
a
national
guard
technician--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
right.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
but
the
technician
status,
your
honor,
is
subservient
to
the
military
status.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
technician
program
is
to
maintain,
equip,
and
train
the
weakened
warrior
personnel.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
it
does.
he
does
have
certain
civil
service
status.
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
competitive
civil
service
but
as
a
result,
he
must
maintain
his
guard
membership
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
which
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
create
a
greater
right
to
guard
membership
for
a
national
guard
technician
as
opposed
to
any
other
national
guardsman.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
your
honor,
the
air
force
regulation
which
is
directive
but
not
binding
on
the
state
of
tennessee
national
guard
and
which
i
understand
is
generally
followed
is
that
the
decision
is
made
by
the
unit
commander.
the
initial
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
accept
the
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
i
have
to
refer
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
we
are
dealing
with
the
basic.
i
am
an
army
man.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
air
force
terminology
and
i
have
to
apologize,
i
do
not
know
whether
its
a
wing
or
group
but
it
is
the
basic
level
unit
commander
would
be
a
company
in
the
army.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
right
your
honor.
and
this
is
in
keeping
with
the
normal.
if
a
man
says
i
want
to
reenlist
and
the
military
says
we
decide
not
to
accept
the
reenlistment,
the
unit
commander
or
his
superior
can
convene
a
board
of
officers
just
to
advice
him,
do
we
think
this
man
ought
to
reenlist?
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
your
honor
i
would
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
now,
the
guardsmen
did
not
have
the
right
of
review.
now
assuming
it
is
a
military
decision,
i
am
sure
if
the
superior
commander
decided
to
countermand
the
decision
of
his
inferior
commander,
then
that
would
obtain.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
he
is
at
the
top,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
it
could
get
to
him
and
i
believe--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
it
is
not
a
right
vested
in
the
guardsman
himself.
it
is
a
method
by
which
the
military
commanders
up
the
chain
of
command
can
make
this
determination.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
exactly.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
you
are
at
zero.
except
you
do
have
a
military
record
to
the
term
and
the
commander
has
seen
your
performance.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
starting
from
scratch.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
right,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
is
the
danger
in
the
sixth
circuit
precedent
in
this
case
that
a
well
pleaded
but
factually
unsubstantial
complaint.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
as
a
technician.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
he
is
subservient
to
the
governor’s
commander
in
chief
but
the
state
guard
is
a
guardsman.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
after
the
constitutionally
protected
ground
such
as
race
or
first
amendment
protected
by--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
then
that
would
be
a
statutory
creative
right
which
there
is
--
not
here.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
military
determination.
now
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no
allegation
here
other
than
--
the
only
allegation
here
is
that
they
chose
not
to
reenlist
him
as
a
sham
to
invoke
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
allegation
was
that--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
and
we
think
so,
your
honor.
but
under
the
complaint
in
this
case,
the
complaint
asserts
that
the
only
reason
they
chose
not
to
reenlist
him,
the
cause
--
the
underlying
cause
might
be
there
but
the
only
reason
was
to
deny
him
any
administrative
review
available
to
him
and
his
technician
status.
so,
what
we
have
here
is
there
are
no
charges
against
this
man.
there
are
no
--
nobody
coming
in
and
making
statements
against
him
that
he
is
being
denied
the
opportunity
to
refute.
it
merely
has
been
a
military
determination
that
they
decide
that
it
was
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
tennessee
air
national
guard
to
opt
for
his
reenlistment.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
right,
right,
your
honor.
it
is
a
military
decision
which
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
we
are
not--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
that
might
be
so,
your
honor,
except
for
the
statute
itself
and
the
legislative
history
itself
indicates
that
the
technician
status
is
subservient
to
the
military
status.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
technician
program
is
to
support
the
military
not
vice
versa
and
the
requirement
that
he
maintain
his
guard
membership
is
in
709(b)
and
(e)(1),
it
states
that
adjutant
general
shall
separate
him
and
it
is
not
until
(e)(3)
where
they
say
if
he
wants
to
fire
him
for
cause,
he
may
do
so
and
later
on
in
the
statute,
it
says
any
appeal
from
that
decision
goes
only
as
far
as
the
adjutant
general.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
are
several
other
reasons
but
if
he
were
separated
for
calls
from
his
technician
job,
certainly
he
is
entitled
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
we
get
to
the
question
of
whether
he
has
a
constitutional
right
and
i
think
maybe
that
we
are
looking
at
the
statute
to
see
whether
it
does
create
a
right
to
continue
guard
membership.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
for
a
cause.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
where
the
complex
subtle
and
professional
decisions
concerning
the
composition--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
in
this
particular
instance,
he
may
well
be
both
but
he
actually
wear
two
hats,
your
honor,
because
as
a
national
guard
technician,
his
supervisor
is
a
civil
service
technician.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
because
you
did
not
fire
him
in
this
case.
he
chose
not
to
reenlist
him
and
there
is
no
right
to
reenlistment.
now,
your
honor,
if
during
his
term
of
enlistment,
during
his
six-year
period
for
apparently
which
this
man
had
enlisted
a
six-year
period
in
the
guard
that
he
had
chosen
to
boot
him
out.
then,
there
are
certain
administrative
rights
available
to
guard
members
before
a
man
can
be
separated
from
the
guard
for
a
cause.
but
this
is
not
the
case
here.
this
is
a
case
where
his
term
was
up,
his
contracts
or
term
was
up
and
he
maintained
--
he
has
no
right
to
continued
employment
or
to
renewed
employment.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
he
apparently
--
now,
this
was
not
alleged
in
the
complaint
below.
he
had
been
in
the
guard
as
i
understand
it
and
all
i
know
is
what
is
in
the
complaint
frankly
for
six
years.
he
was
apparently
enlisted
in
the
guard
and
hired
as
a
civil
service
technician
at
the
same
time.
he
apparently
had
prior
military
experience.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
apparently
so.
now,
this
came
up
on
the
first
time.
your
honor,
this
came
up
that
the
17-and-a-half
years
assertion
came
up
for
the
first
time
at
the
sixth
circuit
level.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
he
had
anymore
time
than
his
six
years
as
a
technician
and
as
a
guardsman.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
as
a
technician?
he
would
have
a
statutory
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
if
dismissed
for
a
cause,
i
think
under
board
of
regions
and
even
under
sindermann
and
i
think
both
of
those
cases
would
indicate
that
he
has
--
if
he
has
the
entitlement
and
if
he
has
charges
brought
against
him
which
should
be
necessary--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
then
he
would
have
this
constitutional
right
but
we
have
neither
of
those
present
here.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
right.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
right.
an
our
position
to
perry
versus
sindermann,
there
is
no
allegation
here
of
any
de
facto
tenure,
not
any
de
facto
opportunity
to
automatically
have
a
right
to
renew
that
contract
absent
any
charges
or
statements
against
him.
and,
i
think
that
is
what
the
crux
of
this
case
is,
is
that
this
decision
is
purely
a
military
decision.
purely
whether
or
not,
the
military,
given
the
discretion
given
to
the
military
--
the
constitution
gave
the
authority
to
run
the
military
to
the
congress--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
they
are
for
military
purpose.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
not
necessarily,
the
very
same
thing
but
in
the
same
unit
and
generally
at
a
rank
in
the
national
guards.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
he
is
definitely
military
on
the
weekends.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
your
honors,
not
necessarily
the
same
thing
but
generally
working
in
the
same
area.
during
the
week,
he
may
be
dealing
more
in
personnel
matters
whereas
on
the
weekend
he
may
have
a
job
as
a
legal
court
for
instance,
a
military
occupation
especially
some,
but
generally,
at
similar
capacity.
and
this--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
this
right,
your
honor,
this
is
a
continuing
operation
of
the
military.
these
men
are
the
ones
that
during
the
week
maintain
the
equipment,
who
keep
the
personnel
paper
works.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
that
is
their
job
and
they
provide
training
schedules
and
matters
for
that.
so,
when
the
weekend
warrior
comes
in
on
saturday
morning
to
do
his
monthly
drill,
he
does
not
have
to
start
from
scratch.
he
is
ready
to
go
and
trying
militarily.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
factual
situation
here.
and
it
is
questionable
under
roth
if
you
are
putting
the
(inaudible),
so
to
speak,
perhaps
he
does
have
some
constitutionally
protective
right
to
some
kind
of
hearing
and
his
technician
status
and
his
military
status,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
ever
been
determined.
i
believe
that
the
military
commander,
this
is--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor.
and
i
think
historically
the
courts
have
chosen
not
to
get
into
that
area
of
military
decision
making
and
not
to
review
the
military
decision.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
as
i
recall
it
at
the
first
argument,
the
question
was
could
they
consider
his
technician
capacity?
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
no,
that
is
my
answer.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
well,
i
felt
like
the
situation
--
the
question
was
different.
i
do
not
know.
i
hope
i
have
not
answered
the
same
question
in
two
different
ways,
i
certainly
did
not
intend
to.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
i
think
that
is
all
right
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
reenlistment,
at
the
end
of
the
enlistment
term.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
they
might
your
honor.
but
now,
i
will
not
--
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
for
a
cause,
your
honor,
and
i
would
reiterate
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
allegation
and
there
is
no
--
the
military
statement
was
that
we
have
chosen
not
to
enlist
you
in
the
best
interest
of
the
national
guard
and
that
is
the
purely
military
decision
that
was
made
by
the
military
commander
and
we
think
that
the
question
at
the
sixth
circuit
post
is
in
of
itself
a
military
decision.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time,
i
have
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
alex
b.
shipley,
jr.
briefly
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
that
this
was
a
purely
military
decision
and
to
refer,
your
honors,
to
the
prayers
of
the
complaint.
he
wants
to
be
reinstated
in
his
employment.
he
wants
to
be
reinstated
in
the
national
guard.
he
wants
full
back
pay
for
any
period
of
time
after
which
he
was
terminated
in
his
guard-technician
status,
and
is
seeking
$100,000.00
in
damages
from
his
military
commanders
and
we
would
assert
that
to
subject
military
commanders
to
the
possibility
of
these
type
suits
would
severely
interfere
with
the
military
preparedness
of
this
country
through
the
national
guard
program.
