mr.
shipley,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
military
or
not?
i
mean,
it
is
the
supposed
thing
that
was
simply
on
a
civilian
context
in
a
classical
employment
at
will
type
of
thing.
does
it
not
the
board
of
regents
versus
roth
indicate
that
there
is
no
requirement
for
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
does
not
require
any
charges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
be
a
constitutionally
impermissible
reason
where
there
might
be
one
that
would
not
meet
the
standard
for
a
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
but
if
it
is
not
constitutionally
impermissible
and
still
it
simply
would
be
a
violation
of
the
cause
requirement
if
it
had
been
done
under
the
cause
section,
what
is
your
argument
for
the
proposition
that
since
they
have
not
proceeded
under
the
cause
section,
nonetheless,
the
provisions
of
that
section
is
somehow
important
and
to
what
otherwise
seems
to
be
rather
unlimited
discretion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
statute
gives
them
two
ways,
does
not
it?
it
says,
you
can
remove
him
for
a
cause
or
you
can
deny
him
reenlistment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
it
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
of
the
active
congress,
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
even
though
he
is
told
he
is
being
denied
reenlistment
rather
than
being
dismissed
from
the
technician’s
job?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
sixth
circuit’s
decision
is
based
on
the
united
states
constitution?
you
intended
its
decision
to
be
based
on
u.s.
constitution.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
argument
here
is
based
in
part
on
the
constitution
as
well
as
on
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
constitutional
point
precisely?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
never
any
public
statement
or
so
far
as
i
can
talk
about
any
private
statement
as
to
why
your
client
was
denied
reenlistment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
do
you
contend
there
was
any
damaging
reason
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
a
reason
given
by
the
people
who
refused
reenlistment
to
him.
