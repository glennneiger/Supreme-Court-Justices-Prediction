justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is...
is
your
argument
that
if
you
don't
interpret
the
second
one
under
federal
law,
you're,
in
effect,
going
to
undercut
the
significance
or
the...
the
efficacy
of
federal
law
in
interpreting
the...
the
first,
the...
the
hamburg
sud?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
but
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
going
to
be
different
in
another
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
is
the
significance,
if
any,
of
cogsa
in...
in
your
analysis
in
coming
to
that
conclusion?
you're
talking
about
pre-cogsa
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
didn't
have
the
prior
cases,
what
would
the
significance
of
cogsa
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is...
what
is
the
efficacy
of
the
cogsa
limit
if...
if
in
fact
the...
the
tariff
is...
the
bill
of
lading
is
not
enforced
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
does
that...
i
mean,
and...
and
assuming
from
that,
that
it
follows
that
this
isn't
federal
jurisdiction
and
so
on...
federal
rule,
where
does
that
leave
the...
sort
of
the...
the
carrier
in
the
middle?
is
the
carrier
in
the
middle
in
a
position
to
know
what
the
result
will
be
on
your
analysis
and
therefore
in
a
position
to
know
whether
he
can
rely
upon
a
federal
rule
or
is
taking
his
chances
with
respect
to
any
state
rule
that
may
apply
because
of
a
railroad
at
the
end
of
the...
the
trip?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's...
it's
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation,
but
the...
the
significance
for...
for
an
understanding
of
the
contract
liability,
which
the
shipper
in
the
middle
is
undertaking,
may
be
enormous.
and
my
question
i
guess
is,
if
we
follow
your
rule
and...
and
we
say
that
because
the...
this
isn't
admiralty,
therefore
there's
no...
there's
no
federal
rule
of
decision,
where
does
that
leave
the...
the
carrier
in
the
middle?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
that's...
that's
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
this
court
know
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that...
i
mean,
that's
ambiguous
on...
on
the
point,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
it...
it
may
be
that
it's
clear
because
it
was
clear
as...
as...
on
the
basis
of
some
legal
principle.
it
may
be
clear
because...
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
this
means,
but
because
they
said
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
an
agency
relationship.
but
this...
this
court
doesn't
know
that.
the...
the
minnesota
opinion
is
ambiguous
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
it
is.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
thought
you...
clarify
this
for
me.
i
thought
you
were
saying
a
moment
ago
they
would
have
to
be
a
third
party
beneficiary
and
they
would
have,
in
fact,
to
have
relied
upon
the...
the
limitation
upstream.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's...
that's...
basically
to
your
central
argument,
that's
neither
here
nor
there.
