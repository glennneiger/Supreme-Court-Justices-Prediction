justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
not
necessarily
true
that
the
law
that
applies
to
the
second
bill
of
lading
also
applies
to
the
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
just
troubles
me
as
i
read
all
the
papers?
has
icc
ever
been
sued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
sued
in
australia.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
for
the
maximum...
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
just
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
suppose
in
this
case,
instead
of
having
a
through
bill
of
lading
from
the
sea
all
through
the...
through
the
railroad,
there
had
been
a
delivery
at
the
port
to
the
freight
forwarder
or
somebody
else
on
behalf
of
the
shipper
and
then
a
new
bill
of
lading
was
issued
to
the
railroad.
would
the
liability
then
be
different
for
the
railroad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
if...
would
the
rate
be
different
in
that
instance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
railroad
would
have
a
different
liability
under
my
hypothetical.
i'm
wonder
if
it
would
have
charged
a
different
amount
for
the
freight.
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
we
assume
that
the
railroad
probably
gave
a
special
bargain
to
the
shipper
in
this
case
because
it
had
a
lesser
exposure
for
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
record
doesn't
actually
tell
us
whether
the
rate
was,
in
fact,
different
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one...
one
last
question?
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
defendant
were
a
longshoreman
rather
than
a
railroad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
the
accident
occurred
not
in
the
shipment
by
rail
carrier
but
unloading
cargo
at
the...
and
the
negligence
was
on
the
part
of
a
stevedore.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
also
whether
it's
a
matter
of
state
or
federal
law
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
referring
to
the...
the
matter
you
quoted
a
moment
ago?
after
the
shipment
arrives
in
the...
on
shore
and
there
is
an
outstanding
maritime
bill
of
lading
that
has
the
cogsa
limits
in
it,
is
the
railroad
entitled
to
rely
on
that
bill
of
lading
in
quoting
a
rate
to
the
maritime
shipper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
it,
they
did
not
do
so
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
it
be
open
to
them,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
say,
whenever
we
get
a
joint
bill
of
lading
like
this,
we're
going
to
give
a
different
rate
because
we
have
a
different
liability
exposure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
in
doing
that,
can
they
rely
on
the
limits
in
the
joint
bill
of
lading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
asking
us
to
hold
that
they
may
not
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
did,
would
there
be
a
different
result
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
norfolk
southern
railway
against
kirby
engineering
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
