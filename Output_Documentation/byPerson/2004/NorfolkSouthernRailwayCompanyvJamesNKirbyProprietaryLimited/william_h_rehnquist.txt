02-1028,
the
norfolk
southern
railway
company
v.
james
n.
kirby.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
was
we
would
be
deciding
a
highly
hypothetical
case
without
knowing
that
federal
law
governed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
for
instance,
we...
we
do
not
accept
stipulations
on
questions
of
law.
we
accept
stipulations
on
questions
of
fact.
you're
saying
it
was
litigated
on
the
assumption
of...
isn't
that
pretty
much
like
a
stipulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
before
erie
against
tompkins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
think
we
would
have
some
reservation
about...
excuse
me...
about
deciding
a
case
where
one
of
the
principal
points
in
issue
was
simply
assumed
rather
than
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
if
the
overseas...
this
maritime
part
of
the
shipping
was
500
miles
and
the
land
part
was
2,000
miles?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
asking
you
to
do
a
mileage
analysis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
not
my
hypothetical,
but
about
the
facts
of
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said,
you're
not
talking
about
the
500
miles
ocean/2,000
miles
land.
you're
talking
about
the
facts
of
the
case
we're
arguing
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
might
not
that
have
been
a
matter
of
contract
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
the
shipping
act
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
briefly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
