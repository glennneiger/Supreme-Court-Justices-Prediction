mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
inclination
is
to
start
with
the
question
that
the
court
asked
for
supplemental
briefing
on
on
monday
and
analyze
the
question
of
which
law
applies,
federal
or
state
law,
and
then
examine
the
issue
of
why
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
primary
reason
under...
with
respect
to
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading
is
that
that
is
incorporated
into
a
tariff
that's
filed
with
the
federal
maritime
commission
under
the
shipping
act
of
1984,
and
it's
long
been
settled
that
the
interpretation
of
tariff
and
obligations
arising
out
of
tariff
filings
are
questions
of
federal
law.
so,
therefore,
in
deciding
what
the
bill
of
lading
by
the
ocean
carrier...
what
effect
it
has
in
terms
of
binding
the
actual
owner
of
the
property
in
operating
through
a
freight
forwarder,
that
would
be
a
question
of
federal
law,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we...
the
parties
clearly
litigated
this
issue
from...
essentially
from
day
one
as
a
question
of
federal
law,
and
i
think
you
could,
in
fact,
simply
accept
that
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court
without
resolving
the
question
of
whether
federal
or
state
law--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it's...
it's
not
as
hypothetical
as
it
might
be
in
some
contexts
because
it's
absolutely
clear
that
there
are
going
to
be
lots
of
instances
in
which
ocean-based
carriers
are
going
to
be
issuing
bills
of
lading
and
which...
and
which
the
responsibilities
or
duties
that
arise
out
of
those
bills
of
lading,
as
they
apply
against
the
actual
owner
in
operating
against
the
freight
forwarder,
are
going
to
arise,
and
there's
not
going
to
be
any
serious
question
in
that
context.
it's
purely
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
quite
sure--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
it's
not
clear
at
all.
there's
no
argument
ever
been
made
by
the
respondents.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
apologize.
i
do
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
if
you
were
looking
at
the
icc
bill
of
lading
and
you
only
looked
at
state
law
or
any
other
law
that
the...
the
ultimate
conclusion
is
inescapable
because
the
language
of
that
contract
says
that
these
conditions,
the
limits
on
liability,
apply
whenever
claims
are
made
against
any
other
person,
including
any
independent
contractors,
whose
services
have
been
used
in
order
to
perform
the
contract.
that's
at
joint
appendix
page
93.
that...
that
language
is
so
absolutely
crystal
clear
and
it
arises
in
the
context
of
a
through
bill
of
lading,
which
made
it
absolutely
clear
to
kirby,
as
the
owner
of
the
goods,
that
this
property
was
going
to
be
shipped
overland
that
there
is
no
way
to
interpret
that
language
under
state,
federal,
australian,
or
anybody
else's
law
as
not
extending
to
this
situation
except
because
of
the
rather
peculiar
interpretation
the
eleventh
circuit
adopted
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
robert
n.
herd.
and
i
think
if
you
recognize
that
the
herd
decision
is
not
meant
either
to
create
a
magic
words
exception
or
to
otherwise
impose
extraordinary
obligations
on
parties
who
enter
into
contracts,
and
that
in
fact
what
we're
looking
for
is
what
was
the
parties'
intent
as
measured
by
the
language
of
the
agreement,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
under
federal
or
state
law,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
icc
bill
of
lading
has
to
be
interpreted
to
extend
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i...
i
think
that
on
the
hamburg
sud
bill,
again
the
easy
way
to
answer
that
is
it's
incorporated
into
a
tariff,
and
if
it's
incorporated
into
a
tariff,
that
means
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
the
same.
i
think
in...
in
this
context
it
makes
sense
that
they
both
ought
to
be
resolved
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
it's
absolutely
clear
that
the
first
bill
of
lading
ought
to
be
interpreted
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
undermines
the
efficacy
of
the...
of
the
federal
uniformity
of
the
hamburg
sud
bill
because
if
you
enforce
that
one,
then
the
second
one
in
some
respects
becomes
irrelevant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but
i
do
think
it...
it
interferes
with--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
might
be
different
in
another
case,
and
i
do
think
it
obviously
interferes
with
the
kind
of
uniformity
you
would
ordinarily
expect
when
you're
dealing
with
essentially
maritime
commerce.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
want
to
be
clear
that
obviously
in
our
view
the...
there's
no
question
about
the
hamburg
sud
bill.
that
one
has
a
$500
cogsa
limit.
it's
embodied
in
there.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
so,
again,
to
the
extent
the
court
decides
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
hamburg
sud
bill,
there's
no
question
that
you
have
to
worry
about
the
meaning
of
the
icc
bill.
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
icc
bill,
i
think
the
united
states
is
correct
that
you
can
certainly
read
that
contract
as...
as
including
a
higher
limit.
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
was
not
the
way
the
case
was
litigated
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
not
the
way
the
case
was
litigated
in
order
to
obtain
interlocutory
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
parties
specifically
stipulated
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
way
this
case
would
be
resolved
most
rapidly
was
by
immediate
review
because
the
amount
in
controversy
would
be
the
$500
cogsa
limit.
so
i
think
there
is
a
very
strong
argument,
justice
ginsburg,
that
that
issue
has
been
waived
by
the
respondents
prior
to
the
time
it
got
to
this
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there's
no
question
that
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
in
the...
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
you'll
find
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
orders
granting
interlocutory
review,
and
they
are
very
explicit
in
identifying
the
$500
cogsa
limit
as
the
justification
by
which
the
parties
decided
to
take
the
case
on
an
interlocutory
basis.
having
obtained
a
benefit
by
making
a
representation
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
there's
a...
that
the
court,
this
court,
ought
to
say
they
are
estopped
to...
to
argue
another
limit
at
this
point.
indeed,
in
our...
in
our
petition,
we
argue
explicitly
for
the
$500
cogsa
limit
because
we
took
that
straight
from
the
district
court's
own
treatment
of
this
issue,
and
the
respondents,
in
their
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
did
not
assert
anything
to
the
contrary.
so
i
would
argue,
under
this
court's
prior
decisions,
that
the
issue
is
waived
at
the
score
as
well.
so
it
seems
to
me
the...
the
more
sensible
way...
and...
and
i
agree
with
you,
the
somewhat
cleaner
and
easier
way
for
this
court
to
resolve
this
case,
is
to
recognize
that
the
plain
language
of
the
icc
bill
of
lading
unquestionably
extends
here,
that
the
parties
have
litigated
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
that's
a
question
of
federal
law,
and
that
the
parties
have
litigated
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
cogsa
limit
of
$500
per
container
applies
to
this
particular
case.
that
said--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--are
you
talking
about
on...
on
the
question
of
whether
federal
law--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--or
state
applies?
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
it
was
a...
i
mean,
it
wasn't
a
stipulation
that
federal
law
applies.
it
was
a
stipulation
in
order
to
obtain
interlocutory
review
as
to
the
$500
limitation...
cargo
limitation.
so
that...
that
strikes
me
as
a
somewhat
different
issue
for
the
court
to
resolve.
and
it's
not
the
issue
that's
been
posed
for
this
court
to
decide
in
any
event.
it
seems
to
me
at
a
minimum
if
you
simply
accept
the
case
as
having
come
to
you
with
the
understanding
of
a
$500
limit
and
reverse
on
the
basis
of
either
of
the
other
two...
on
the
basis
on
the
two
court
of
appeals
errors,
either
one
of
them,
and
the
case
goes
back
to
the
lower
courts,
they
can
fight
over
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
issue
has...
has
been
properly
preserved.
but
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly
that
it
has
not.
now,
that
said,
while
i
agree
with
justice
breyer's
assessment
that
in
some
respects
the
icc
bill
of
lading
is
potentially
a
simpler
way
of
resolving
the
case,
i
also
believe,
frankly,
that
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading
is
in
some
ways
a
more
important
basis
on
which
the
court
ought
to
decide
this
question.
the...
the
issue
of
what
effect
an
ocean
carrier's
bill
of
lading
has
on
the
conduct
of
the...
of
the
owner
of
the
property
is
an
issue
that,
as
a
matter
of
common
carriage
law,
this
court
has
resolved
since
before
the
civil
war.
and
the
clearest
case
in
which
to
my...
from
my
perspective
is
the
great
northern
opinion
where
the...
where
this
court
specifically
said
that
the
owner
of
the
goods
who
operate
through
a
freight
forwarder
is
bound
by
the
bill
of
lading
issued
by
the
railroad
whether
as
a...
an
agent
or
as
a
freight
forwarder.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
understand
that,
and...
and
all
i'm
saying
is
what
is
the
federal
rule.
and
what
this
court
said
as
a
matter
of
what
is
the
federal
rule
is
that
you
don't
apply
strictly
agency
principles
when
you're
dealing
in
the
area
of
common
carrier
relationships
and
liabilities.
and
again,
remember,
from
my
perspective,
the
easiest
way
for
this
court
to
reach
the...
this
question
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
is
because
this
is
embodied
in
a
tariff,
and
the
filed
rate
doctrine
has
long
recognized
that
when
you're
enforcing
the
rights
and
obligations
arising
out
of
a
tariff,
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
so
the
real
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
what
is
the
rule
of
law
that
should
be
applied
in
this
context.
this
court
announced
that
rule
of
law
in
great
northern.
it
actually
announced
it
before
the
civil
war
in
york.
it
had
announced
it
again
in
acme
fast
freight.
and
it
has
consistently
held,
as
a
matter
of
carrier
relationships
and
as
a
matter
of
an
efficient
method
of
moving
goods
in
interstate
and
international
commerce,
that
you
must
hold
the
owner
of
the
goods
strictly
to
the...
to
the
tariff
arrangements
in
the
bill
of
lading
when...
with
or
without
the
use
of
a
freight
forwarder.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
cogsa
directly
affects
that
particular
analysis
other
than
by
enforcing
the
bill
of
lading.
that
is
the
only
mechanism
by
which
you
get
cogsa
incorporated
into
the
international
scheme.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
cogsa
says
that
there
are
$500
limits
on
the
bill
of
lading,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
tell
you
the
question
of
what's
the
relationship
between
the
owner
or
the
freight
forwarder
and
the...
and
the
ocean
carrier
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
then
cogsa
has
no
role
at
all,
which
is
why
it's
very
important,
if
cogsa
is
to
have
a
meaningful--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
was
trying
to
get
there
too.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i
was
getting
there
pretty
slow.
i
apologize.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
cogsa,
yes.
that's
one
ground
on
which
you
can
get
there
as
a
federal
question.
the
shipping
act
i
think
also
makes
a...
a
federal
question,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--ultimately
you'd
say
the
maritime
statute
makes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
there
are
three
theories
that
have
been
put
forward
in
the
past.
one
i
think
is
embedded
in
this
court's
decisions,
and
particularly
great
northern
where
the
court
talks
about
because
necessities,
and
in
york
where
the
court
recognizes
that
the
carrier
doesn't
know
the
difference
between
a
freight
forwarder
and
a
shipper
and
it's
unreasonable
to
allow
the
shipper
to
get
off
the
hook
when
the
shipper
chooses
the
freight
forwarder
and
can
structure
a
better--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
legal
basis
is
that
because
the
carrier
is
obliged
to
take
the
goods
and
cannot
discriminate,
that
he
has
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
person,
and
that
the
courts
are
not
going
to
impose
an
obligation
on
him
to
look
behind
who
shows
up
with
the
goods
in
order
to
determine
the
rights
or
obligations
of
the...
of
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
that's
the
first
of
my
three
theories.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
the
second
one
is
a
bailment
theory,
and
we...
we
spent
a
little
bit
of
time
on
that
in
the
reply
brief.
but
if
you
look
at
english
common
law,
english
common
law
uses
a
combination
of
bailment
and
sub-bailment
to
get
to
exactly
the
same
result
where
the
owner
of
the
goods
is
bound.
and
then
the
final
theory
is
one
that
comes
out
of
the
restatement
of
agency,
and
it's
the
limited
power
theory,
that
it's
not
a
true
agent.
and
i
understand
the
reason
why
there
is
some
reluctance
to
call
this
a
true
agency
relationship
because
if
you
impose
agency
duties,
you
may
expose
the
owner
to
significantly
more
expansive
liability
than
he
otherwise
would
have
reasonably
undertaken,
which
is
why
this
court,
i
think,
has
wisely...
and
i
think
most
of
the
courts
have
wisely...
said,
no,
it's
not
a
pure
agency
relationship.
it's
a
common
carrier,
bailment,
limited
power
type
of
a
relationship
which
imposes
you...
which
allows
you
to
go
downstream
under
your
contracts.
you
can
sue
us
under
the
contract,
but
just
as
you
can
sue
us
pursuant
to
the
contract,
you're
also
bound
at
the
end
of
that
process
by
the
liability
limitations
that
are
embedded
in
that
same
agreement.
i
think
those
are
the
three
theories
that
lead
you
to
the
right
conclusion
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
i...
as
i
recall
the
way
that
amicus
brief
reads,
it's
a
little
cagier
than
that
because
it
says
of
the
law
that
we
have
evaluated
in
this
brief,
nowhere
else.
and
i'm
telling
you
that,
one,
in
uk
it's...
clearly
the
rule
is
to
the
opposite.
and
i
don't
believe
there
was
anything
in
there
about
japanese
law.
i
mean,
what's
really
missing
in
this
case
is
none
of
our
trading
partners
came
in
here
and
argued
that
this
is
a...
that
there's
a
problem
in
the
interpretation
that
we've
put
forward.
i
would,
frankly,
dismiss
out
of
hand
the
position
of
the
law
professors.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
icc
was
sued
in
australia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
was
settled,
so
i
don't
know.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
they
made
the...
the
full
claim.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
start
by
trying
to
clarify
the
herd
holding.
herd
did
not
involve
the
himalaya
clause
since
there
was
no
question
about
downstream
liability
or
the
limits
on
liability,
and
so
what
the
court
said
there
is
if
your
agreement
extends
to
carriers,
it
doesn't
extend
on
to
stevedores.
our
agreements
extend
well
beyond
carriers
under
these
circumstances,
and
we're
asking
to
have
them
applied
in
this
particular
context.
justice
stevens,
with
respect
to
your
question
about
the
rate
flexibility
that
we
had.
there
is
no
question
that
the
protections
of
the
hamburg
sud
bill,
which
we...
which
we
accepted
for
these
purposes,
carries
with
it
rates
that
we...
there
are
limitations
on
liability
that
norfolk
southern
was
intimately
familiar
with,
relied
upon
in
setting
the
rate.
you
could...
you
could
have
assumed
that
based
on
the
court's
analysis
in
great
northern,
but
the
reality
is
that,
of
course,
entities
that
engage
in
these
kinds
of
operations
and
the
kind
of
common
enterprises
know
what
their
rates
are
and
they
set
the
rates.
and
if
you
had
broken
this
rate...
this
transportation
down,
it
would
have
required
a
different
rate
setting
regime,
and
the...
and
the
circumstances
would
have
been
fundamentally
different.
the
basic
point
here
is
that
there
is
a
reliance
and
interest
that
is
implicated
here.
mr.
frederick,
with
all
due
respect,
has
described
to
you
a
world
that
is
not
the
world
in
which
ocean...
ocean
carriers
and
rail
carriers
and
shippers
ordinarily
operate.
the
world
in
which
we
operate
is
one
in
which
we
say
either
declare
the
value
of
the
goods
or
live
with
the
limitation
on
liability.
they
never
declared
any
value
of
the
goods.
there's
no
way
for
the
freight
forwarder
to
declare
the
value
if
the
shipper
doesn't
do
that
in
the
first
instance.
and
all
of
the
limits
of
liability
flow
directly
from
that.
it's
not
unfair.
it
doesn't
unduly
limit
the
remedies
available
for
the
owner
of
the
goods.
he
always
has
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
the
option
of
declaring
the
goods,
making
us
the
insurer
under
those
circumstances,
and
we
never
do
it.
the
fact
that
there
are
no
such
cases,
justice
breyer,
strikes
me
as
the
clearest
evidence
that
the
rule
of
law,
as
we've
described
it
in
our
briefs
and
as
our
amicus
have
described
it,
is
the
standard
that
has
applied
to
the
worldwide
carriage.
one...
two
last
points.
justice
breyer,
you
asked
me
for
a
couple
of
theories
about
how
to
get
to
the
right
answer.
one
other
theory
is
the
entrustment
of
the
goods
creates
an
implied
consent
to
be
bound.
that's
a...
an
argument
that's
been
made.
and
then
finally,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
about
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
acme
fast
freight
is
a
post-erie
case,
along
with
great
northern
is
itself
obviously
a
decision
that
comes
out
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
and
then
finally,
with
respect
to
great
northern,
i
would
urge
the
justices
to
read
the
brief.
it's
absolutely
clear.
thank
you,
your
honor.
