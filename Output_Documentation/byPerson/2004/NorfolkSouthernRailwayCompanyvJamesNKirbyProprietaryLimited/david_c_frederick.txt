mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
at
the
beginning
in
this
litigation
because
the
district
court
ruled
erroneously,
on
page
38a
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading
controlled
and
allowed
norfolk
southern
to
limit
its
liability.
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading
is
the
wrong
bill
of
lading.
so
when
we
took
an
interlocutory
appeal...
and
the
reason
it's
the
wrong
bill
of
lading
is
because
kirby
was
not
a
party
to
that
bill
of
lading.
and
our
theory
all
along
has
been
we
are
not
bound
to
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading.
we
weren't
a
party
to
it,
and
icc
was
not
our
agent
for
purposes
of
entering
into
that
bill.
we
took
an
interlocutory
appeal,
saying
the
district
court
was
wrong.
it
applied
the
wrong
bill
of
lading.
that
bill
of
lading
provides
for
the
cogsa
limit
f
$500.
it
shouldn't
have
applied
that
limit.
it
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
very
importantly,
when
we
filed
a
motion
for
interlocutory
appeal,
we
did
not
state
that
federal
substantive
law
governs.
that
is
nowhere
in
the
interlocutory
appeal
petition.
we
cited
five
cases,
three
from
the
second
circuit,
two
from
the
ninth
circuit.
four
of
those
cases
involved
clearly
the
application
of
state
substantive
law.
they're
contract
interpretation
cases
in
which
federal
courts--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
your
honor.
we...
the
parties
never
argued
what
substantive
law
applied.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
this
court
would
be
making
precedent,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
wrong
legal
theory
for
what
substantive
law
controls.
and
this
is
a
very
important
point.
the
question--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--true,
your
honor,
but
that
isn't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
that...
there's
no
agreement
here,
and
that's
our
point.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we're
objecting
now.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
not
late,
your
honor,
because
the...
the
question
here...
this
is
a
diversity
case.
and
we
brought
a
tort
action,
and
under
the
normal
rules
that
have
been
applied
ever
since
the...
the
1941
decision
of
this
court
in
claxson
is
that
you
look
to
the
state
law
to
be
applied.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
true.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
why
it's
important
that
you
understand
what
their
theory
is
for
applying
federal
maritime
law.
this
court's
decision
in
victory
carriers
said,
you
do
not
apply
federal
maritime
law
until
you
establish
that
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
constitution,
article
iii,
section
2
says
the
judicial
power
extends
to
cases
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.
so
you
look
first
to
determine
is
there
admiralty
jurisdiction.
now,
there's
no
claim
here
that
the
tort,
the
train
derailment,
is
a
maritime
tort.
that
would
be
an
absurd
argument.
their
only
argument
is
that
the
multimodal
through
bill
of
lading,
because
it
covers
partly
ocean
carriage,
has
to
be
a
maritime
contract.
that
theory
is
wrong,
and
it's
been
rejected
by
virtually
every
court
that
we've
been
able
to
find,
including
cases
that
the
government
cites
in
their
brief
on
page
7.
what
the
courts
have
held
is
that
with
a
mixed--
1
contract
that
has
part
maritime
and
part
non-maritime
obligations,
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
defeated.
and
that
is
the
uniform
holding
of
all
of
the
cases.
and...
and
judge
friendly
in
the
leathers
best
case
in
1971
set
this
out
very
clearly,
and
what
he
said
was
when
you
have
a
mixed
contract,
you
cannot
apply
admiralty
jurisdiction
under
this
court's
precedent
in
the
eclipse
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
souter,
our
position
is
that
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation.
and
the
reason
why
federal
courts
have
not
looked
at
the
state
substantive
versus
federal
substantive
law
question
is
they
simply
looked
at
the
words
in
the
contract.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
carrier
has
uniformly
been...
the...
the
issue
is
a
question
of
contract
interpretation.
what
do
the
words
mean?
and
the
carrier
in
all
these
cases
imposes
a
limitation
of
liability
in
the
contract.
and
the
question
is
one
of
interpretation
as
to
does
that
limitation
apply.
we
cited
a
number
of
cases,
justice
souter,
where
it's
clear
that
issue
is
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
substantive
law,
even
when
the
shipment
starts
in
korea,
lands--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
respectfully,
yes,
it
is,
justice
scalia,
because
you
have
to
look
at
who
was
within
the
clause.
but
the
way
the
courts
have
treated
this,
under
the
mixed
contract
doctrine,
which
we
set
out
in
our
supplemental
brief,
is
to
look
at
whether
the
maritime
obligations
are
separable
from
the
non-maritime
obligations,
and
where
they
are
separable,
then
you
would
apply
the
maritime
law
to
that
part
of
it,
which
is
a
maritime
obligation,
here
the
sea
carriage,
and
you
would
apply
non-maritime
law
to
the
inland
carriage.
and
here
there's
no
question
that
a
train
derailment
would
be
non-maritime
because
it
is...
involves
a
locus
on
the
land
and
not
at
sea.
now,
based
on
this
court's
decisions
and
the
application
of
the
mixed
contract
doctrine,
you
would
be
deciding
a
question
of
state
substantive
law,
which
you
are
clearly
empowered
to
do.
the
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
precedent,
you
should
not
assume
that
federal
maritime
law
applies
here
because
to
do
that
would
make
the
multimodal
industry
subject
to
the
federal
maritime
law.
and
that's
what
the
government
has
just
suggested,
extending
the
jenson
line
not
just
from
the
water's
edge,
but
inland.
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
o'connor,
if
congress
makes
that
decision,
that's
certainly
an
appropriate
thing
for
discussion
for
legislation.
our
submission
is
that
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
judge-made
law
where
the
parties
have
not
litigated
this
until
10
days
before
the
oral
argument,
should
not
be
decided
in
this
case
to
doctrinally
extend
the
jenson
line
to
a
place
where
it
has
never
before
existed.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
most
of
them
have
choice
of
law
provisions
that
states
respect
and
as
did
the
icc
bill
of
lading
which
applied
for
the
country's
law
of
shipment
to
govern.
that's
in
the
last
clause
of
the
icc
bill
of
lading.
so
most--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
yes.
i
can
point
you
to
several
court
of
appeals
decisions,
and
in
particular,
i
would
point
you
to
judge
cabranes'
decision
in
the
hartford
insurance
case,
which
we
have
cited.
i
would
cite
you
to
judge
diane
wood's
opinion
for
the
seventh
circuit
just
last
year
in
the
insurance
v.
hanjin
shipping
case.
and
importantly,
i
would
point
you
to
judge
friendly's
seminal
decision
in
leathers
best,
a
decision
decided
in
1971.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
substantive
answer,
as
i
think
norfolk
southern
has
basically
conceded
on
the
agency
point,
there's
no
question
that
if...
if
that
is
decided
as
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation,
we
win.
they've
never
disputed
that
the
words
do
not
create
an
agency.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
with
respect
to
which
question?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
our
position
with
respect
to
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading
stays
the
same,
that
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading
does
not
control
for
the
same
agency
reason
that
we
set
forth
in
our
briefs.
with
respect
to
the
himalaya
clause
issue,
which
i'm
assuming
you're
asking
about--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think
victory
carriers
answered
the
question.
it
would
depend
on
how
the
accident
happened.
if
the...
if
the...
and
this
is
the
confusion
that
is
raised
in
the
cases
that
we
cited
to
the
court
of
appeals.
in
one
of
them,
a
ninth
circuit
case,
the
stevedore
dropped
the
cargo
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel,
and
that's
the
only
maritime
law
case
that
we
think
would
be
governed
by
substantive
maritime
law.
all
of
the
other
cases
involved
the
stevedore
committing
a
tort
on
land--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
therefore
would
fall
on
the
land
side
of
the
locus
jurisdiction.
so
those
are
the...
the
three
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
petition
to
the...
from
the
second
circuit.
one
of
them,
the
scheiss
case,
the
finlander,
in
footnote
2,
makes
it
very
clear
there
that
it
was
dealing
with
state
law,
and
that's
because
the
stevedore
there
committed
the
tort
on
land.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
your
honor,
the...
there
was
a
limitation
of
liability
in
the
icc
bill
of
lading.
and
justice
breyer,
it's
set
forth
in
clause
8.3
that
two
special
drawing
rights
per
kilogram
gross
weight
would
be
applied.
to
translate
that
for
you,
that's
the
hague-visby
limits
which
dramatically
increase
the
limits
from
the
hague
rules
which
australia
has
adopted
in
its
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
insurer
here,
justice
o'connor,
is
the
real
party
in
interest
because
it
subrogated
interests.
it
paid
its
insurance--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
wants
to
collect
against
the
wrong...
the...
the
wrongdoer
here,
which
is
norfolk
southern.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that...
that
there's
been
this
comment
by
the
government,
which
is
strange,
about
efficiencies.
if
you
look
at
the
maritime
cases
that
are
decided,
a
very
high
proportion
of
them
are
brought
by
insurance
companies
to
bring
claims
against
negligent
wrongdoers.
that's
how
you
keep
premiums
down.
if
a
wrongdoer
commits
a
tort--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--but
that's
not
the
system,
justice
breyer,
and
that's
important
for
you
to
understand.
that
is
not
the
system
that
we
have
because
we
have
insurance
companies
bringing
subrogated
claims
all
the
time
against
negligent
wrongdoers,
and
they
do
that
in
order
to
get
recoveries
for
losses
that
they
have
to
pay
out.
that's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--hartford
insurance.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
read
hartford
insurance.
judge
cabranes
lays
this
all
out.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
he
explains
it
very
clearly
why
an
insurance
company
would
bring
a
subrogated
claim,
and
that
claim
would
be
decided
by
state
substantive
law,
notwithstanding--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--through
bill
of
lading.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
reflected
in
the
marketplace.
the
insurance
rates
are
going
to
be
set
on
the
basis
of
loss
recoveries
with
the
idea
of
deterring
negligent
conduct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i...
i
haven't--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
uncitral
process
has
negotiated
this
very
point,
justice
breyer.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
cert,
it
involves
very
delicate
compromises
among
a
whole
range
of
maritime
and
non-maritime
interested
parties.
we
submit,
as
a
matter
of
common
law,
for
this
court
to
drop
in
and
make
a
decision
in
this
case
would
have
only
one
small
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
is
being
negotiated
internationally
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
issue.
and
our
submission
is
the
international
parties
and
the
12
professors
that
mr.
phillips
said
should
be
given
no
weight,
as
the
amicus
brief
points,
are
virtually
all
the
representatives
of
their
countries
at
these
uncitral
negotiations.
and
they're
telling
you
that
international
uniformity
would
be
served
by
affirming
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
and...
and
reflecting
what
parties
understand--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
two
cases
that
i'm
familiar
with,
justice
breyer,
are
from
japan
and
korea,
and
the
japan
case
actually
deals
with
this
bill
of
lading
and
comes
to
exactly
the
same
conclusion
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
here.
what
the
scholars
have
said,
though,
is
that
because
the
shipper
would
not
be
bound
by
the
non-vessel-operating
carrier's
subsequent
subcontract,
that
there
would
be
no
basis
for
applying
a
different
limitation
of
liability
other
than
the
one
the
cargo
owner
entered
into
in
that
contract
with
the
non-vessel-operating
carrier.
and
that's
clear
from
professor
ramberg's
treatise
on
the
law
of
freight
forwarding,
his
amicus
brief
which
sets
this
out
clearly--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
britain...
well,
britain
does
it
differently
to
this
extent.
britain
applies
a
concept
called
bailment
on
terms,
which
again
norfolk
has
introduced
as
a
totally
new
theory
in
their
reply
brief
on
the
merits.
but
they
misapply
the
bailment
on
terms
argument.
the
bailment
on
terms
concept
applies
when
the
bailee,
the
carrier,
is
having
control
of
the
goods
and
damages
those
goods,
and
there's
a
suit
brought
against
that
carrier,
and
he
says,
i
get
to
carry
it
on
my
terms.
there's
no
concept
in
the
law
of
bailment
for
a
sub-bailee
to
say,
well,
i
don't
like
my
terms.
i
want
to
use
a
different
carrier's
terms.
and
that's
what
norfolk
southern
is
arguing
here.
they
don't
want
to
apply
their
terms
of
carriage
because
their
terms
of
carriage
provide
a
$250,000
per
container
limit,
which
would
more
than
amply
satisfy
the
damage
caused
to
kirby's
goods.
they
want
to
rely
on
a
different
bailee's
terms.
and
they
cite
no
case
and
there
is
none
that
we're
aware
of
that
applies
the
bailment
on
terms
concept
in
that
way.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
only
when
the
forwarder
was
the
agent
of
the
owner.
the
cases
that
i'm
familiar
with
have
been
thrown
out
where
the
forwarder
was
in
fact
a
carrier
and
therefore
had--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
if
you
were
to
conclude,
justice
kennedy,
in
this
case
that
icc
is
the
sort
of
quasi-agent,
whatever
their...
however
you
want
to
characterize
norfolk's
theory
here,
that
wouldn't
be
applicable
in
australia,
which
would
apply
its
own
precedents
to
say,
no,
it
isn't.
it's
a
carrier.
and
as
a
carrier,
it
owes
no
fiduciary
duty
and
cannot
bind
kirby
because
kirby
did
not
consent
to
be
bound
by
the
terms.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
like
to
address
the
o'connor
case
because
i
think
that
has
been
badly
misunderstood
and
represented
by
the
other
side
in
this
case.
we
went
back
and
looked
at
the
trial
record,
and
in
the
trial
record,
one
of
the
instructions
to
the
jury
stipulated
that
the
freight
forwarder
was
the
owner's
agent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
forwarder
was
mrs.
o'connor's
agent
in
that
case,
and
the
case
proceeded
all
the
way
up
on
the
assumption
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
forwarder
was
serving
as
the
agent.
now,
our
submission
is
simple.
you
can't
read
that
and
say
that
that
announces
some
common
law
rule
when
the
jury
is
being
stipulated
and
both
sides
agree
that
boyd
is
her
agent.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
believe
that
the
fair
way
to
read
mrs.
o'connor's
brief
in
the
case...
and
we
cite
it
in
our...
our
brief...
is
that
yes,
it
did.
the...
the
minnesota
supreme
court
opinion
in
that
case
said
the
instructions
were
not
objected
to.
it
is
clear
mrs....
boyd
is
o'connor's
agent,
and
we
think
it
is
the
case--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
justice
souter,
the
jury
charge
is
in
the
supreme
court
record.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
where
we
found
it.
and...
and
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
there
was
something
else
different,
the
interstate
commerce
act
passed
filed
tariff
requirements
that
under
the
act,
as
a
statutory
matter,
the
cargo
owner
was
assumed
to
understand,
and
that's
how
the
railroad
law
developed.
now,
the
government
makes
the
leap
that
because
o'connor
did
that
in
the
rail
context,
the
same
answer
has
to
apply
here
in
the
shipping
act
context,
but
that
is
completely
flawed.
they
give
you
some
of
the
statutory
provisions
in
an
appendix
to
their
supplemental
brief,
but
they
leave
out
the
most
important
one.
and
that
is
the
provision
that
says,
if
a
vessel
carrier
enters
into
a
service
contract,
it
can
be
done
confidentially
and
would
not
be
subject
to
the
normal
tariff
requirements.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
i'm
talking
about
the
shipping
act,
and
the
provision
is
1707(c)(1).
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
proposition
has
been
so
clear
that
no
one
has
had
the
audacity
to
argue
it
for
a
railroad.
[laughter]
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
i
don't
want
to
create
work
for
your
law
clerks,
but
if
you
did
a...
a
search
for
himalaya
clause,
your
law
clerk
will
find
400
cases
decided
since
the
robert
c.
herd
decision,
most
of
which
will
have
been
brought
by
insurance
companies.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
insurance
companies
are
bringing
this
against
non-maritime
parties.
it's
long
been
understood
that
himalaya
clauses
are
intended
to
protect
only
maritime
parties.
there
is
no
reported
court
of
appeals
decision--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question
of
me,
justice
stevens,
because
it...
it
may
but
that
isn't
what
happens.
their
own
rail
circular
has
no
mention
of
ocean
bills
of
lading.
their
own
rail
circular
says
we...
you
accept
our
terms
and
you
do
it
on
the
basis
of
our
rates.
and
their
rates
for
damage
at--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
there's
no--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
certainly
have
contractual
freedom
to
alter
their
relations
in
the
future.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
don't
do
that
and
they
haven't
done
that.
and
we
found
no
evidence
of
industry
practice
that,
in
fact,
they
do
do
that.
in
fact,
the
best
evidence
of
that,
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
our
position
is
that
they
have
to
come
forward
with
some
indication
that
in
fact
that's
what
they
did,
and
they
haven't
done
that.
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
they
did
because
they
contracted
with
a
different
party.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
so,
and
the
reason
is
that
each
of
these
carriers
in
their
own
subcontracts
are
having
a
contractual
relation
with
the
party
with
whom
they
deal.
and
if
that
means
that
if
that
party
wanted
to
break
through
the
limit,
they
would
be
bound
by
the
contract.
that
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
an
upstream
harmed
party
would
be
bound
by
it.
that's
the
herd
case.
i
mean,
in
herd,
it's
very
important
that
you
understand
the
very
last
paragraph
of
the
court's
opinion
because
the
court
there
relied
on
an
australian
high
court
opinion
in
which
it
said...
and
if
i
could
just
substitute
the
parties
and
read...
hamburg
sud
was
engaged
by
icc
and
by
nobody
else.
icc
had
no
authority
whatever
to
bind
kirby
by
contract
with
hamburg
sud,
and
no
principle
of
law
compels
the
inference
of
any
contract
between
kirby
and
hamburg
sud.
that's
the
very
last
paragraph
of
this
court's
decision
in
herd
as
understood
through
the
lens
of
what
our...
our
case
is
here.
so,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the...
the
point
is
contractual
privity
would
determine
the
relationships
between
the
parties
with
whom
there's
a
contract,
and
where
there
isn't
contractual
privity,
if
they
are
not
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
the
contract,
they
would
be
liable
for
full
damages,
as
the
stevedore
was
in
the
herd
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think
reliance
necessarily
has
to
be...
establishes
a
legal
requirement.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
no
reliance
in
this
case
and
there's
no
reliance
in
the
industry
that
i'm
aware
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
right.
the
question
is
are
they
a
third
party
beneficiary.
and
norfolk
southern
clearly
is
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
that's
the
hold
of
the
herd
case.
the
stevedore
was
not
allowed
to
claim
the
limits
of
the
ocean
carrier
and
was
liable
for
the
full
tort.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that...
could
i
answer
this
question,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
would
be
going
to
a
bailment
on
terms
argument.
if
you
were
to
find
that
norfolk
southern
is
entitled
to
rely
on
its
own
terms
as
a
bailee,
their
rail
circular
would
govern.
our
position
is
we
get
full
damages
under
that
too.
