mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unless
corrected
by
this
court,
the
erroneous
rules
of
law
announced
by
the
court
of
appeals
will
produce
substantial
inefficiencies
and
frustrate
longstanding
and
important
congressional
policies
in
the
ocean
transportation
arena.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
federal
or
state
law,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
response
to
your
questions,
it
would
not
be
hypothetical
or...
or
an
inappropriate
acceptance
of
a
stipulation
on
a
question
of
law
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
parties'
implicit
agreement
that
it
is
governed
by
federal
law
because
parties
are
always
permitted
to...
to
agree
to
choice
of
law,
which
is
all
we
would
be
talking
about
here.
there's
no
jurisdictional
problem
because
jurisdiction
is
clearly
present.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading,
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
that
is
unquestionably
covered
by
federal
law
because
of
the
application
of
the
shipping
act
and
the
tariff
regime
and
the
nondiscrimination
principle
that
requires
enforcement
of
the
terms
of
the
bill
of
lading,
which
is
incorporated
into
the
tariff.
and
even
with
respect
to
the
icc
bill
of
lading,
where
parties
have
agreed
on
choice
of
law,
it's
appropriate
for
a
court
to
accept
that
agreement,
and
it's
not
hypothetical
because
it's
unquestionable
that
there
will
be
many
circumstances
in
which
the
very...
in
which
the
question
presented
here
and
the
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals
will
be
implicated
in
purely
maritime
context--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
that's
an
open
question,
and
we've
argued
in
our
supplemental
brief
that
it
would
be
appropriate,
if
the
court
felt
it
necessary
to
address
that
question.
we
don't
think
it
is
necessary,
but
if
the
court
felt
it
necessary
to
address
that
question,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
conclude
that
in
the
specific
context
we
have
here
in
a
multimodal
bill
of
lading
for
transportation
internationally
by
ship
and
also
by
land
carrier,
where
the
clause
in
issue,
the
himalaya
clause,
is
applicable,
we
submit,
to
both
by
its
terms,
to
both
maritime
players
and
land
carriers,
read
in
accordance
with
its
terms,
where
you're
interpreting
a
clause
that
has
application
clearly
in
the
maritime
as
well
as
the
inland
context,
it
is
appropriate
to
apply
the
established
maritime
rules
of
construction
to
that
clause
because
this
is
a
maritime
bill
of
lading
and
uniformity
in
this
area
is
extremely
important.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
while
the
borders
between
the
federal
maritime
law
and
state
law
are
very
unclear
and
it's
a
flexible
analysis
where...
where
uniformity
is
important,
federal
maritime
law
will
govern.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
we
think
it
would
be...
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
do
a
mileage
analysis.
i
mean,
here
the...
here
obviously
i
think
the...
the
mileage--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
we
would
submit
that
it...
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
adopt
a
rule
in
which
the...
the
applicability
of
federal
law
depends
on
the
relative
mileage
because
that
would
create
uncertainty
and
confusion,
although
here,
if
one
were
to
apply
such
a
rule,
it
would
suggest
application
of
federal
maritime
law,
given
the
distance,
more
than
10,000
miles
versus
366
miles.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
your
hypothetical,
again
i
think
that
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
our
submission
that
federal
law...
federal
maritime
law
would
govern
if
you
have
a
through
bill,
an
intermodal
bill
of
lading
involving
maritime
transportation
in
the
international
context,
which
would
be
subject
to
maritime
law,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
apply
maritime
in
construing
the
himalaya
clause.
but
again,
the
court
need
not
reach
that
question.
we
think
if
the
court
does
consider
the
application
of
federal
law
and
federal
interpretative
principles
to
the
icc
bill
of
lading,
the
answer
is
clear.
the...
the
plain
text
of
the
bill
of
lading,
of
the
himalaya
clause--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
it
would
because
in
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
it
would
be
if
it...
a
through
rate...
by
definition,
if
you
have
a
through
bill,
you
have
a
through
rate.
it's
one
rate
offered
by
the
ocean
carrier
that
encompasses
the
whole--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--the
record
doesn't
reveal
that,
but...
but
it
would
have
been
a
different
negotiation
obviously,
subject
to
different
terms,
and
it
seems
likely
that
the
rate
would
have
been
different.
whether
higher
or
lower
is
unclear
but...
because
in
that
circumstance,
the...
depending
on
the
terms
of
the...
of
the
contract
between
the...
the
railroad
and
the
shipper,
it
might
have
been
subject
to
the
carmack
amendment
which
provides
a
different
liability
limitation
regime--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
that
seems
appropriate
to
assume.
hamburg
sud
is
a
major
ocean
carrier
and
norfolk
southern
is
a...
a
major
rail
carrier.
and
it
seems
appropriate
to
assume
that
in
their
negotiations,
they
would
address
questions
such
as
limitation
of
liability.
the...
the
record
here
is
clear.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
hamburg...
that...
that
norfolk
southern
carried
under
the
terms
of
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading,
and
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
they
were
relying
on
that,
that--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
justice
o'connor,
the
railroad
industry
has
been
deregulated,
but
the
shipping
industry
has
not.
and
the
tariff
requirement
specifically
requires
an
ocean
carrier
like
hamburg
sud
to
file
its
tariff
and
its
bill
of
lading
for
through
routes
covering
the
entire
through
route
that
is
the
subject
of
the
transportation
being
offered
and
provided.
so
in
that
sense,
it's
true
that
normally
the
nondiscrimination
principle
would
not
apply,
but
in...
in
the
context
of
a
through
bill,
which
this
is,
issued
by
an
ocean
shipper,
an
ocean
carrier,
the
nondiscrimination
principle
is
applicable,
and
that's
under
section
1707(a)(1)
of
the
shipping
act.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
tariff...
with
respect
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
your
question
about
great
northern,
great
northern,
although
decided
pre-erie,
is
not
a...
it
was
not
decided
under
diversity
jurisdiction.
it
was
a
case
that
came
out
of
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
so
swift
v.
tyson
would
not
have
been
applicable.
and
more
importantly,
although
the
court
was
perhaps
not
as
clear
as
we
would
have
liked
in
explaining
the
rationale
for
its
holding,
it's
clear
that
it
was
relying,
at
least
in
part,
on
federal
tariff
regulations,
essentially
the
same
as
those
at
issue
here.
the
court
said...
and
this
is
on
page
515
of
its
opinion...
so
long
as
the
tariff
rate,
based
on
value,
remained
operative,
it
was
binding
upon
the
shipper
and
carrier
alike
and
was
to
be
enforced
by
the
courts
in
fixing
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
parties.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
did
in
that
case,
and
we
submit
that's
exactly
what
the
court
should
do
in
this
case
as
well.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor,
because
it's
very...
it's
very
clear
that...
that
tariff
rates
are
enforceable...
federally
filed
or
federally
published
tariff
rates
are
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
liability
limits
are
part
of
that,
as
this
court
said
in
precedents
that
the...
that
are
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
and
the...
that's
a
federal
law
question,
not
merely
a
question
of
state
law,
when
there
is
a
federal
tariff
regime
in
place.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
that's
exactly
the
facts
in
great
northern.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
in
great
northern,
the
shipper
hired
the
boyd
transfer
company
to...
to
ship
the
goods,
which
in
turn
hired
the
railroad,
and
then
the
shipper
tried
to
sue
the
railroad,
and
the
court
said
you
can't
do
that
and...
and
clearly
relied,
at
least
in
part,
on
the
tariff
regime,
as
well
as
the...
the
whole
history
of...
of
the
federal
common
carrier
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
the...
again,
in
great
northern,
the
court
was
presented
with
that
issue.
the...
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
argued
that
the
transfer
company
was
not
its
agent
and
therefore
it
wasn't
bound.
they
argued
that
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
and
this
court
essentially
said
it
doesn't
matter.
whether
agent
or
forwarder,
the
railroad
there,
the...
the
carrier
that
actually
carried
the
goods
is
entitled
to
rely
on
its
bill
of
lading,
its
tariff
as
against
in
a
suit
brought
by
the...
the
shipper,
the
owner
of
the
goods.
that's...
that's
precisely
the
fact
situation
at
issue
here.
the
court
felt
it
unnecessary
to
resolve
the
dispute
about
whether
the...
the
forwarder
in
that
context
was
an
agent
forwarder
or
a
full-fledged
common
carrier
forwarder.
