i'm
not
sure
it's...
it's
just
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation.
the...
the
contract
is
clear
that
there's
a
limitation
of
liability.
the
question
is
whether
that
limitation
of
liability
applies
to
someone
who
is
not
privy
to
the
contract.
that's...
that's
not
an
issue
of...
of
contract
interpretation.
