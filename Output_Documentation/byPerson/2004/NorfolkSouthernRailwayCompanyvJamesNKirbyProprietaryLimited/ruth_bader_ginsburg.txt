mr.
phillips,
i
hope
maybe
you
make...
you're
going
to
make
this
point
later,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
important
which
contract
controls
because
the
government
has
made
an
argument,
as
you
know,
that
the
cogsa
limit,
the
$500
per
package,
would
not
apply
under
the
icc
contract,
that
the
number
there
would
be
$450,000.
it's...
so
i
hope
you
will
explain
to
us
why...
if
you
think
that
the
government
is
wrong,
why
they
are
wrong
in
saying
if
it's
the
icc
contract
with
kirby,
then
the
appropriate
limit
is
not
cogsa
but
the
$450,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one...
one
brief
does
take
quite
a
clear
position
on
this.
i
don't
know
if
it's
right
or
wrong,
but
respondents
tell
us
that
there's
nowhere
in
the
world
except
venezuela
where
the
cargo
owner,
kirby
here,
would
be
bound
by
a
bill
of
lading
that
the
ocean
carrier
issues
to
the...
a
non-vessel-owning
common
carrier.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
make
any
difference
that
we
have
this
division
between
freight
forwarders
who
act
as
agent
for
the
cargo
owner
and
the
so-called
nvocc
that...
that
act
as
principal
vis-a-vis
the
ocean
carrier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
there
are
diversity
cases
in
which
federal
maritime
law
has
applied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
doesn't
follow
like
the
night,
the
day,
that
because
it's
brought
under
the
heading
of
diversity,
that
therefore
state
law
applies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
right,
mr.
frederick,
that
it's
state
law
that
controls,
then
why
should
we
decide
anything
beyond
that
choice
of
law
question?
because
if
state
law
controls,
then
louisiana
could
do
it
one
way,
mississippi
could
do
it
the
other
way.
why
should
we
be
concerned
what
the
substantive
answer
would
be
if
state
law
controls?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever.
if
there's
contract
determination
under
state
law,
why
should
this
court
be
resolving
the
question,
however
clear
it
may
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we've
opposed
certiorari.
we've
put...
used
every
line
of
every
brief
that
we've
been
able
to
submit
in
this
case.
this
is
an
interlocutory
appeal
of
a
tort
brought
in
diversity
where
there's
a
contract
interpretation
issue
raised
as
a
defense.
our
position
all
along
has
been
that
this
court
should
not
decide
the
case.
but
if
i
could
turn
to
the
merits--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
you...
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what...
what
does
govern
their
liability
in
your
view?
you
referred
to
this
circular
a
couple
of
times.
that's
not
a
tariff.
is...
is
your
position
they
were
negligent
and
whatever
the
damages
you
proved?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
does
the...
what
does
the
circular
have
to
do
with
anything?
