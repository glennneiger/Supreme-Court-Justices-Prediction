justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
i'm
glad
you're
doing
that.
this
is
a
suit,
a
diversity
suit,
between
an
australian
entity
and
a
virginia
company
about
a
rail
accident
on
land,
and
why
do
you
think
federal
law
applies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was...
was
the
question
waived
by
the
respondent
below?
how...
how
did
you
all
proceed
on
this
assumption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hungar,
the
railroad
industry
has
been
deregulated.
as
a
result,
i
suppose
the
nondiscrimination
policy
doesn't
apply.
it
may
end
at
the
water's
edge.
so
how
would
there
be
any
preemption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
point
to
the
record
anyplace
where
you
took
the
position
below
that
federal
law
could
not
and
did
not
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
shouldn't
we
just
say
you
both
assumed
it
was
going
to
be
decided
under
federal
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
the
parties
presumably
could
agree
among
themselves
in
the
contract
what
law
to
apply.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
it
a
step
to
say
they
can
implicitly
agree
the
same
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
objection.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it's
a
little
late.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
jenson
line
may
make
real
sense
in...
in
its
application
to
intermodal
bills
of
lading
like
this
which
occur
all
the
time.
it
seems
so
strange
that
a
carrier
like
hamburg
sud
would
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
money
finding
out
if
they're
contracting
with
an
intermediary
who
has
other
contracts
or
what's
going
on.
i
mean,
these
are
things
that
happen
all
the
time,
and
i
wonder
if
the
jenson
line
isn't
the
correct
line
to
look
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
frederick,
just
as
a
practical
matter,
why
isn't
the
client
satisfied
with
suing
icc
for
damages,
which
i
understand
has...
has
been
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
i...
i
understood
that
kirby
collected
insurance
and
sued
icc.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
wants
now
to
collect
money
from
norfolk.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
this
is
a
maritime
case
about
a
train
wreck.
james
kirby,
an
australian
manufacturing
company,
sold
10
containers
of
machinery
to
a
general
motors
plant
located
outside
huntsville,
alabama.
it
hired
international
cargo
control,
which
i
will
call
icc,
an
australian
freight
forwarding
company,
to
arrange
the
delivery.
because
it
does
not
itself
actually
moved
cargo,
icc
then
hired
hamburg
sud,
a
german
ocean
shipping
company
to
transport
the
machinery.
hamburg
sud
intern
hired
norfolk
southern
railway
to
transport
the
machinery
on
its
final
leg
from
the
port
in
savannah,
georgia
to
the
destination
in
huntsville.
the
norfolk
train
carrying
the
goods
derailed
in
route
causing
an
alleged
1.5
million
in
damages.
kirby
and
its
insurers
sued
norfolk
railroad
in
federal
district
court
in
georgia
alleging
tort
and
contract
claims.
norfolk
argued
that
kirby's
potential
recovery
could
not
exceed
the
amounts
set
forth
in
the
liability
limitations
in
the
two
contracts
negotiated
for
the
machinery's
carriage,
a
contract
between
kirby
and
icc,
and
a
contract
between
icc
and
hamburg
sud.
the
district
court
granted
norfolks
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment.
a
divided
panel
of
the
eleventh
circuit
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse
the
eleventh
circuit
judgment.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
we
hold
that
federal
law
governs
the
interpretation
of
the
two
contracts
at
issue.
we
think
that
the
two
contracts
here
are
maritime
contracts
because
their
primary
objective
is
to
accomplish
the
transportation
of
goods
by
sea
from
australia
to
the
eastern
coast
of
the
united
states.
while
some
state
and
australian
concerns
are
certainly
implicated,
they
cannot
be
accommodated
without
defeating
the
federal
interest
in
preserving
the
uniform
meaning
of
maritime
contracts
and
the
uniformity
of
maritime
law
more
generally.
turning
to
the
merits,
we
hold
that
norfolk
can
take
a
shelter
in
the
liability
limitations
contained
in
both
of
the
contracts
or
as
the
shipping
industry
calls
them,
bills
of
lading.
the
first
bill
of
lading
that
icc
issued
to
kirby
says
that
its
liability
limitation
should
extend
to
any
servant
agent
or
other
person
including
any
independent
contractor
whose
services
have
been
used
in
order
to
perform
the
contract.
the
plain
language
of
that
clause
indicates
that
per
its
intent
to
extend
liability
limitations
broadly.
hunstville
is
about
366
miles
inland
from
savannah,
and
the
parties
must
have
anticipated
that
a
land
carrier
services
would
be
necessary
for
the
contract's
performance.
it
is
clear
to
us
that
a
railroad
like
norfolk
was
an
intended
beneficiary
of
the
broadly
written
clause.
the
second
bill
of
lading
that
hamburg
sud
issued
to
icc
extends
the
limitation
of
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act
the
limit
of
$500
per
package
unless
expressly
provided
otherwise
to
potential
damages
on
land
in
the
course
of
delivery.
applying
a
rule
for
our
precedent
about
common
carriage,
we
hold
that
kirby
is
bound
by
the
liability
limitation
in
the
contract
between
hamburg
sud
and
the
icc.
while
icc
was
not
kirby's
agent
in
every
sense,
it
was
for
a
single
limited
purpose
in
negotiating
down
stream
limitations
on
liability.
thus,
it
was
able
to
bind
kirby
when
making
a
contract
with
hamburg
sud
about
liability.
this
rule
tracks
practices
in
the
international
shipping
industry.
it
promotes
non-discrimination
on
common
carriage
and
we
think,
produces
an
equitable
result.
accordingly,
kirby
cannot
recover
more
than
$500
per
package
from
norfolk
and
the
judgment
is
unanimous.
