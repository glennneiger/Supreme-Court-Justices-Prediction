justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
your
view
of
that?
because
if
you're
right
on
that
icc
bill
of
lading
and
the
limit
is
the
same,
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
other
question,
which
i
think
is
much
harder.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
are
we...
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
what
do
i
look
up
to
find
out
whether
you're
right
about
this
and
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
other
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it?
now,
this
is
maybe
only
me,
but
i
don't
think
it
is.
what...
the
basic
question,
in
my
mind
anyway,
in
respect
to
the
hamburg
sud
bill
of
lading
is
one
i
would
have
thought
would
have
been
answered
in
the
law
clearly.
i
said
the
supreme
court
cases
aren't
clear
because
they
don't
say
what
the
theory
behind
them
is.
i
read
all
these
amicus
briefs.
they
don't
really
seem
to
me
to
come
to
the
point.
you
have
a
shipper
of
some
goods.
he
goes
to
an
independent
freight
forwarder
who
then
enters
into
a
series
of
contracts.
i
don't
care
if
they
were
ships
or
trains
or
whatever.
and
something
happens
to
the
goods.
maybe
they
weren't
shipped.
maybe
that
independent
freight
forwarder
went
bankrupt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the...
mr.
shipper
wants
to
sue
one
of
these
carriers.
well,
he
didn't
sign
the
contract,
and
the
person
who
signed
it
was
an
independent
freight
forwarder,
not
wholly
his
agent.
okay.
can
he
do
it
or
not
do
it?
i
have
all
about
the
law
of
france
in
one
of
these
briefs,
except
they
just
don't
tell
you
the
answer
to
that
question.
they
just
don't
tell
you
whether
in
france,
sweden,
or
finland
or
some
other
place,
when
the
shipper
wants
to
go
and
sue
one
of
those
carriers,
he
can
recover.
there's
a...
there's
a
limit...
liability
limitation
in
the
contract.
the
contract
is
enforceable.
there
could
be
100
situations
where
it
comes
up.
what's
the
answer?
i'm
amazed
that
that's
never
been
answered
in
200,000...
2,000
years
of
people
shipping
things.
all
right.
so...
so
why
is
this
so
unclear?
why
can't
i
get
an
answer?
and
i
just
can't
find
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
it's
very
unreasonable.
but
even
i
can't
say
there's
a
general
rule
of
law
against
behaving
unreasonably.
so,
therefore,
i
look
for
a
theory.
what's
the
legal
basis?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
clear
that
they're
applicable...
the
tariff
as
a
matter
of
law...
to
a
shipper
that
hires
an
independent
freight
forwarder
to
arrange
for
the
shipment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
i
mean,
all
over
the
world,
people
ship
with
these
bills
of
lading.
the
shipper
simply
gets
a
piece
of
paper.
it
says
it's
a
bill
of
lading
and
it's
going
to
be
sent
to
anyone
of
5
billion
destinations.
four
billion
of
the
5
billion
will
involve
some
little
bit
of
inland
travel.
now,
if
suddenly
the
laws
of
50
states
were
to
apply
to
all
those
bill
of
ladings,
wouldn't
it
be
an
all-time
mess?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
i
can
read
that
would
help
me
decide
if
it
really
would
be
a
mess
or
wouldn't
be
a
mess?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean,
the...
the
argument,
which
i'm
really
interested
in
your
addressing,
is
that
overall,
naturally
any
insurance
company
would
like
to
get
the
money
if
it
could.
but
overall,
a
system
that's
developed
where
the
shippers
buy
first
party
insurance
and
get
their
money
if
they're
hurt
and
the
carriers
all
know
their
tort
liability
is
limited
in
contract
liability
is
one
that
overall
avoids
lawyers,
avoids
lawsuits,
avoids
tremendous
expense,
and
has
led
to
lower
rates
and
better
service.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
this
happens
all
the
time.
if
it
happens
all
the
time
that
the
subrogated
insurer
goes
and
sues
someone
down
the
line
with
whom
the
shipper
himself
did
not
enter
into
a
liability
limiting
contract,
why,
after
reading
these
briefs,
do
i
feel
i
can't
find
a
case
in
point--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
for,
arguably,
this
old
case
of
the
supreme
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
hartford
insurance,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
maybe
that
is
what's
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
let
me
ask
you.
is
it
necessarily
going
to
be
true
that
if
we
agree
with
you
and
shippers
in
general
did
want
to
have
first
party
insurance
and
did
want
to
contract
for
these
lower
rates,
et
cetera,
you
just
couldn't
create
the
system
because
carriers
down
the
line
would
look
back
and
see
that
the
independent
freight
forwarder
was
the
party
in
interest
at
the
first
contract
for
transportation
would
have
no
idea
whether,
behind
that
independent
freight
forwarder,
there
stood
another
independent
shipper
or
there
did
not,
and
thus
would
not
know
whether
his
liability
was
really
limited
or
not,
and
therefore
would
have
to
charge
a
price
that
in
fact
reflected
a
liability
regime
where
he
might
have
to
pay
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
now
taking
your
answer
to
my
question
is
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
there
is
no
way
to
do
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
in
fact...
all
right.
if
there
is
a
way
to
do
it,
i
want
to
find
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
with
the
professors
was
i
thought
not
all,
but
most
of
the
cases
they
cite,
they're
citing
for
the
proposition
that
the
person,
i.e.,
the
independent
freight
forwarder,
is
indeed
independent
and
not
the
agent
of
the
shipper.
i...
i
got
that.
but
what
i
wonder,
of
course,
is
whether
that
fact
translates
in
their
law
into
the
conclusion
that
therefore
the
carrier
ultimately
is...
that
he
cannot
assert
a
liability
limitation.
that's
the
ultimate
question.
and
there
were
one
or
two
that
did
seem
to
say
that,
but
most
of
them
just
didn't
seem
to
talk
about
that
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
britain
does
it
differently
though,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
britain
does
it
differently
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
you'd
have
to
say...
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
say
that
northern
case
rests
on
the
principle
that
the
agent...
he's
not
an
agent
for
most
purposes,
but
he
is
an
agent
for
the
purpose
of...
of
entering
into
a
liability
limitation.
and
that's
not
unheard
of
in
the
law.
it...
it's
an
agency
type
power
that's
given
to
a
person
who
isn't
an
agent.
and
the
argument
would
be,
well,
that's
the
precedent
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
if
that's
right...
let...
just
why...
as
a
simple,
empirical
question,
if...
if
this
is
so,
you
know,
fairly
clear,
he's
not
an
agent,
independent,
you
can't
enforce
the
liability
thing,
why
aren't
the
case
books
filled
or
the...
the
reports
filled
with
cases
where
an
insurer
went...
and
it
subrogated,
went
and
sued
somebody
down
the
line
and
they
asserted
a
liability
limitation
and
people
laughed
and
said
it's
not...
you
can't
assert
that,
he
never
entered
into
a
contract
with
you?
why
isn't
that
true
in
all
these
eight
foreign
countries?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
we
find
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
find
judgments.
no,
i'm
sorry.
we
would
find
in
insurance
records,
for
example...
insurance
companies...
they're
proud
of
the
money
they
get
back.
it
would
be
easy
to
locate
lots
of
instances
where
insurance
companies
did
recover,
subrogated,
from
carriers
down
the
line
who
were
unable
to
assert
liability
limitations.
