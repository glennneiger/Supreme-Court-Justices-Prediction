justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
there
basically
to
comment
on
the
point
that
justice
scalia
made
in
the
course
of
the
last
argument?
the
context,
as
we
know,
has
changed
pretty
radically
in
the
course
of
litigation
over
this
and
it
started
out
with
just
the
ten
commandments
alone
and
then
version
2,
the
ten
commandments
had
certain...
were
surrounded
by
certain
quotations
of
religious
content
from
other
texts.
and
finally,
as
i
guess
literally
is
true
with
a
new
lawyer
and
more
litigation,
we've
gotten
to
the
present
context.
isn't
the
problem
that
you
have
to
face,
as
i've
said
before,
what
justice
scalia
raised
before,
everybody
knows
what's
going
on.
everybody
knows
that
the
present
context
is
simply
litigation
dressing
and
that
the
object
for
what
is
going
on
is
the
object
that
was
revealed
in
the
first
place.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
created
the
land
mine
basically.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
if
we
still
have
a
purpose
inquiry,
what
you
say
of
course
is
true.
the
current
display
includes
the
display
of
a
lot
of
legal
documents.
but
is
there
any
reason
for
anyone
to
believe
that
that
display
of
legal
documents
or
anything
else
would
be
there
for
any
other
purpose
than
the
display
of
the
ten
commandments,
including
the
religious,
the
overtly
theistic
part
of
the
text
of
the
ten
commandments?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
abandoning
the
position
that
you
have
a
right
to
make
this
kind
of
religious
display,
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
there...
i
guess...
i
don't
want
to
tie
you
up
too
long
but
i
mean
given
the
history,
isn't
it
still
the
case
that
there
is
no
serious
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
any
object
here
other
than
the
display
of
the
ten
commandments
including
the
overtly
theistic
text
and
the
rest
of
this
is
basically
enabling
context
which
does
not
affect
the
objective,
the
objective
being
the
ten
commandments
and
the
religious
text?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
not
forever
but
for
now.
this
isn't
a
case
in
which
they
came
up
with
the
ten
commandments
display,
it
got
enjoined
and
10
years
later
somebody
comes
along
and
says,
let's
have
a
display
of
important
documents
in
the
history
of
law.
this
in
fact
is
a
continuous
process
and
it
is
a
continuous
process
within
the
context
of
litigation
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
display.
it's
not
a...
the
implication
is
not
that
you
can
never
have
a
different
display
but
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
intent
of
this
display
has
changed
as
the
context
has
changed.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
assume
if
you
were
running
a
course
in
a
school
about
the
biblical
text,
you
would
explain
the
differences.
you
would
indicate
the
difference
between
the
jewish,
the
roman,
the
protestant,
the
lutheran
and
so
on
and
you're
not
doing
that
here.
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
might
be,
well,
if
that
really
made
a
difference,
we
could
have
separate
versions.
but
it's
not
comparable
to
school
teaching.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
think
it
was
appropriate
in
a
public
school
course
that
was
otherwise
a
bona
fide
course
to
teach
the
day
on
exodus,
to
teach
about
simply
the
protestant
version
of
the
ten
commandments?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
a
public
school,
wouldn't
it
be
required,
at
least
for
intellectual
reasons
if
not
the
reasons
of
the
establishment
clause
to
say,
well,
graven
images
are
dealt
with
differently
in
the
standard
roman
translation
and
the
preamble
sections
of
what
may
and
may
not
be
regarded
as
commandment
number
1
are
different
in
the
christian
versus
jewish
and
so
on.
wouldn't
that
be
an
intellectually
responsible
requirement?
justice
david
h.
souter
exactly.
i
thought
you
were
equating
the
two
together.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
in
marsh,
there
wasn't
any
question
that
what
they
were
doing
was
praying.
and
here
it
seems
to
me
that
the
change
that
you're
arguing
for
as
significant
is
only
significant
unless
it
is
a
change
in
the
essential
activity
because
there
is
no
law
and
it
would
be
crazy
law
from
this
court
that
said
you
can
engage
in
religious
endorsement,
promotions,
et
cetera,
so
long
as
you
hide
the
ball
well
enough.
what
this
court
basically
has
said
is
you
can
engage
in
secular
objectives
that
incidentally
involve
religious
figures
or
references,
e.g.,
moses
up
there.
what
you
started
with
in
this
case
or
what
the
county
started
with
was
a
pretty
religious-looking
exercise
and
the
question
is,
did
they
go
from
a
totally
religious
exercise
to
a
secular
exercise
or
did
they
go
from
an
obviously
religious
exercise
to
an
obscured
religious
exercise?
and
therefore,
you
can't
make
context
a
mere
change
in
physical
context
dispositive
because
it
ignores
that
distinction.
and
that
distinction
i
think
is
what
is
driving
or
what
is
going
to
drive
possibly
in
my
mind
the
resolution
of
this
case.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that
point?
and
i
should
know
the
answer.
it
must
be
in
the
briefs
but
i
don't
remember.
i
assume
that
they
rescinded
the
resolution
before
version
3
of
the
display
was
put
up,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
still
on
the
books?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
explain
why
you
distinguish
text
and
symbolize
them?
you
distinguish
text
from
the
crucifix
and
so
on.
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
the
text
part
but
why
not
adopt
the
same
test
for
the
symbols?
for
example,
why
not
adopt
it
for
the
moses
up
here?
the
burden
would
be
on
the
government
to
show
that
it
was
not
approving,
endorsing,
et
cetera,
and
in
this
context,
that
would
be
pretty
easy.
why
not
have
the
same
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
first
case
in
which
i
have
the
announcement
this
morning
is
mccreary
county
v.
aclu,
no.
03-1693.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
issue
two
identical
series
of
ten
commandments
displays
erected
by
county
officials
in
two
kentucky
courthouses.
the
first
display
in
each
county
consisted
of
a
large
gold
frame
copy
of
the
ten
commandments
that
was
hung
in
1999
in
a
busy
hallway
of
each
courthouse.
the
respondents,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
brought
a
lawsuit
against
the
county
petitioners
alleging
the
displays
violated
the
clause
of
the
constitution
prohibiting
the
establishment
of
religion.
the
county
is
responded
by
passing
identical
resolutions
stating
that
the
commandments
were
the
precedent
legal
code
for
kentucky
law,
and
approvingly
citing
various
sectarian
references
including
the
kentucky
legislature’s
description
of
jesus
christ
as
the
prince
of
ethics.
as
called
for
by
the
resolutions,
the
county’s
extended
the
displays
to
surround
the
ten
commandments
with
smaller
size
patriotic
and
legal
documents
that
highlighted
religious
references.
the
district
court
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
requiring
the
displaced
to
be
taken
down.
it
found
that
poses
risks
and
the
second
displays
lack
any
secular
purpose
and
that
the
county’s
object
was
instead
to
advance
religion
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
at
this
point,
the
county
has
got
a
new
lawyer
and
installed
another
display,
the
third
within
a
year.
this
one
was
entitled
“the
foundations
of
american
law
and
government”
and
it
comprise
an
extended
text
of
the
commandments
surrounded
by
equal
size
copies
of
such
documents
as
the
bill
of
rights,
a
picture
of
lady
justice
and
the
lyrics
of
the
star
spangled
banner.
the
commandments
now
had
an
explanatory
note
next
to
them
stating
that
they
profoundly
influence
the
formation
of
our
county
and
thus
us
seen
in
the
decoration
of
independence.
the
district
court
found
that
this
display
also
violated
the
establishment
clause
concluding
that
the
county
has
claimed
broader
educational
goals
crumbled
upon
examination
of
the
litigations
history.
it
divided
sixth
circuit
panel
affirmed
the
preliminary
injunction
on
much
the
same
ground.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
now
affirm.
the
primary
questions
this
case
presents
are
first
the
extent
to
which
governmental
purpose
is
relevant
in
enforcing
the
establishment
clause,
and
secondly
where
they
past
official
action
can
be
relevant
in
evaluating
current
actions.
as
the
opinion
explains,
an
evaluation
of
purpose
has
been
a
long
standing
all
be
it
rarely
just
positive
feature
of
our
establishment
clause
cases.
purpose
is
critical
because
it
directly
relates
to
a
central
establishment
clause
principle
neutrality.
the
idea
that
the
government
may
not
discriminate
among
religions
who
are
between
religion
and
your
religion.
well,
no
one
principle
can
be
this
positive
in
many
situations
in
which
religion
and
government
intersect.
neutrality
has
long
been
attached
down
of
our
cases
and
when
the
government
is
understood
to
take
sides
purposely
in
religious
matters,
there
can
be
no
neutrality
but
only
the
social
attention
that
the
framer
sought
to
avoid
in
drafting
the
establishment
clause.
we
thus,
reaffirm
today
that
government
action
predominantly
intended
to
advance
religion
is
not
permitted
under
the
establishment
clause.
applying
this
principle
to
the
case
at
hand
we
reached
the
following
conclusions:
twenty-five
years
ago
in
the
case
of
stone
v.
graham,
we
recognized
and
held
something
pretty
obvious
that
the
ten
commandments
are
inherently
religious
statements,
that
does
not
to
be
sure
mean
that
every
governmental
display
of
the
commandments
is
unconstitutional,
context
matters
and
where
the
display
serves
on
educational
or
other
predominantly
secular
goal,
the
display
can
be
constitutional.
in
fact,
moses
and
the
commandments
are
displayed
in
this
very
courtroom
up
on
the
south
and
east
but
moses
stands
there
in
the
company
of
other
lawgivers
both
great
and
secular
demonstrating
that
the
display
is
about
lawgivers’
not
about
religion
and
was
not
the
product
of
some
religious
objective.
in
the
kentucky
courthouses
however,
the
first
commandment’s
display
consisted
of
the
text
of
the
commandments
in
isolation
showing
that
any
integration
into
a
secular
project
the
commandment’s
text
including
such
provision
as
“thou
shall
have
no
other
gods
before
me”
leads
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
the
county
has
intended
to
put
out
a
religious
message.
the
second
display
only
amplified
this
religious
message
and
indeed
the
county
has
make
not
attempt
to
defend
it
describing
the
second
display
as
dead
and
buried.
that
display
with
its
explicitly
cite
herein
resolution
and
surrounding
religious
references
could
leave
no
doubt
that
the
county
is
intended
to
make
a
religious
statement.
in
evaluating
the
third
display,
we
have
to
consider
the
two
displays
that
immediately
preceded
it.
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
justified
in
concluding
that
the
county
has
had
not
shown
any
secular
educational
purpose.
the
counties
did
not
repeal
the
religious
resolution
that
accompanied
the
second
display,
iin
fact
the
third
quoted
the
religious
prohibitions
of
the
commandments
and
even
more
detail
than
the
preceding
once
had
done.
the
county’s
educational
claims
were
also
undermined
by
the
scatter
shot
nature
of
the
supposedly
foundational
materials
accompanying
the
commandments,
for
example,
the
picture
of
lady
liberty
and
the
overstated
description
of
the
commandments
influence
on
american
law.
in
upholding
the
district
court’s
conclusions
that
the
county
has
still
had
a
predominantly
religious
purpose
in
erecting
the
third
display,
we
do
not
hold
that
past
unconstitutional
purposes
have
attained
future
government
action.
instead,
we
acknowledge
only
that
stated
purposes
must
be
creditable
before
they
will
be
credited
and
that
the
district
court
which
was
familiar
with
the
facts
in
this
case
was
warranted
in
concluding
that
the
counties
had
not
adapted
a
new
purpose.
finally,
a
word
needs
to
be
said
about
the
dissent
in
this
case.
the
dissent
calls
decades
of
precedent
adhering
to
the
neutrality
principle
to
return
what
it
believes
to
be
the
framers’
understanding
of
the
establishment
clause,
but
the
dissent’s
account
of
history
is
not
compelling
and
certainly
not
sufficient
to
over
rule
60
years
of
precedent
recognizing
government
neutrality
as
an
objective
of
the
establishment
clause.
while
the
dissent
cites
evidence
showing
that
some
framers
like
our
first
president
included
religious
references
and
official
speech.
here
is
evidence
that
equally
prominent
figures
like
jefferson
and
madison
believed
that
references
to
be
for
those
references
to
be
forbidden
under
the
establishment
clause.
and
if
the
history
of
official
religious
acknowledgment
is
too
murky
to
justify
departing
from
a
neutrality
precedence
then
the
new
rule
of
the
dissent
derives
some
history
should
quicken
our
resolve
to
stick
with
the
precedent.
but
the
dissent
will
not
allow
the
government
to
espouse
and
acknowledge
the
core
religious
beliefs
of
some
religious
faiths
all
those
that
are
monotheistic
but
not
others.
while
some
members
of
this
court
have
argued
that
the
establishment
clause
that
bids
only
discrimination
among
religious
sects
but
not
between
religion
and
irreligion.
this
is
the
first
time
the
view
has
been
advanced
that
the
government
may
favor
some
religions
but
not
others.
we
think
that
this
view
flies
in
the
face
of
the
neutrality
that
framers
thought
necessary
to
prevent
the
religious
strife
with
which
they
were
all
too
familiar.
as
for
us,
we
are
centuries
away
from
the
st.
bartholomew’s
day
massacre
and
from
the
treatment
of
heretics
in
early
massachusetts
but
the
divisiveness
of
religion
in
current
public
life
is
indisputable.
this
is
no
time
to
turn
our
back
on
the
principle
of
neutrality.
it
has
served
religious
liberty
and
freedom
of
conscience
so
well.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
will
announce
the
dissenting
opinion.
