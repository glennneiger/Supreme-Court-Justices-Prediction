justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
mccreary
county
against
the
aclu.
mr.
staver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
souter,
in
fact
it
would
be
somewhat
comparable
because
if
you're
teaching
general
biblical
text,
you
wouldn't
have
all
the
different
versions
lined
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
certainly
may
do
so.
mr.
clement,
you're
welcome
back
for
a
second
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
basically,
and
i
think
i
understand
you,
you're
saying,
and
i
think
you
said
it
earlier,
drop
the
intent
clause
and
basically
have
a...
try
to
move
toward
an
objective
criterion
saying
there
are
some
ways
you
can
display
religious
things
and
some
ways
perhaps
that
you
can't
and
try
to
develop
that
kind
of
objective
jurisprudence
as
distinct
from
an
intent
jurisprudence.
that's
your
point,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
mr.
friedman?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
all
of
that
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
i
don't
think
we
should
talk
about
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
friedman,
can
you
tell
me
where
in
the
joint
appendix
the
resolution
appears?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
other
question
i
have
is
assuming
you
didn't
have
any
of
this
history
and
they
started
off
with
plan
3,
would
that
have
violated
the
establishment
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
primacy
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
real
position
is
they
wouldn't
have
to
have
done
that
as
long
as
they
had
the
ten
commandments
in
the
display,
that
would
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
exactly
what
we've
got
in
exhibit
3
or
whatever
it
is,
that
we
don't
have
the
statement
of
purposes,
we
don't
have
them
saying
it's
the
sole
source
or
the
primary
source.
they
say
it's
a
source.
does
that
still
violate
the
establishment
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
friedman.
mr.
staver,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
correct
that
it
was
not
amended
when
the
third
display
was
created?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
the
last
expression
of
the
governing
body's
intent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
