what
if
its
purpose
were
to
demonstrate...
and
i
quote
from
one
of
our
earlier
opinions...
that
we
are
a
religious
people
whose
institutions
presuppose
a
supreme
being.
what
if
that
were
its
purpose?
would
that
have
made
it
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
ten
commandments
are
longer
than
the
legislative
prayers
you've
heard
at
the
beginning
of
congressional
sessions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
the
acknowledgment
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
we
don't
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
who
we're
addressing
when
we
say
god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.
they're
not
talking
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
stands
for
that.
as
you
heard,
the
code
takes
various
forms
for
various
religions.
and
i
think
all
it
stands
for
is
the
proposition
that
the
moral
order
is
ordained
by
god.
that's
all
it
stands
for.
and
to
say
that
that's
the
basis
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
of
our
institutions
is
entirely
realistic.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
they're
really
saying
that
the
particular
commandments
of
the
ten
commandments
are
the
basis
of
the
declaration
of
independence.
that's
idiotic.
what
the
commandments
stand
for
is
the
direction
of
human
affairs
by
god.
that's
what
it
stands
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
what
it
means,
it's
idiotic.
i
don't
think
anybody
is
going
to
interpret
it
that
way.
you
can't
get
the
declaration
of
independence
out
of
the
ten
commandments.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
think
that's
how
somebody
would
normally
read
it.
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
the
principle
of
laws
being
ordained
by
god
is
the
foundation
of
the
laws
of
this
state
and
the
foundation
of
our
legal
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
the
difference.
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
it
would
violate
the
establishment
clause,
it
would
equally
do
so
if
you
said
it's
a
major
part
of
or
even
a
part
of.
now,
maybe
it
makes
it
wrong
to
say
it's
the
exclusive
one.
it
may
make
it
more
wrong
but
we're
not
grading
papers
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
it
violates
the
establishment
clause
depends
upon
whether
you're
endorsing...
whether
you're
proselytizing
religion.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
dissent
is
divided
into
three
parts;
the
last
two
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
and
thomas
discussed
respectively
how
today’s
opinion
retch
it
up
this
court’s
hostility
to
religion
by
adding
two
new
elements
to
the
famous
lemon
test
that
it
has
been
using
in
establishment
clause
cases
for
about
the
last
50
or
60
years,
and
how
even
applying
that
heightened
tests
the
display
of
the
ten
commandments
in
this
case
passes
master
because
there
is
a
distinction
between
preaching
religion
and
acknowledging
the
role
of
religion
in
our
national
history.
i
want
to
summarize
this
morning
only
part
1
of
my
opinion
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas.
on
september
11,
2001,
i
was
attending
in
rome,
italy
an
international
conference
of
judges
and
lawyers
principally
from
europe
and
the
united
states.
that
night
the
president
of
the
united
states
gave
an
address
to
the
nation
concerning
the
murderous
attacks
upon
the
twin
towers
and
the
pentagon
in
which
almost
3,000
americans
were
killed.
the
address
ended
as
presidential
addresses
often
do
with
the
prayer,
“god
bless
america.”
the
next
afternoon,
i
was
approached
by
one
of
the
judges
from
european
country
who
after
extending
his
profound
condolences
on
my
country’s
loss
sadly
observed
how
i
wish
that
the
head
of
state
of
my
country
at
a
similar
time
of
national
tragedy
and
distress
could
conclude
his
address,
“god
bless
the
name
of
the
county.”
it
is
of
course
absolutely
forbidden,
he
said.
that
is
one
model
of
the
relationship
between
church
and
state.
a
model
spread
across
europe
by
the
armies
in
napoleon
and
reflected
in
the
constitution
of
france
which
begins
france
is
a
secular
republic.
religion
is
strictly
excluded
from
the
public
forum.
that
is
not
and
never
was
the
model
adapted
by
america.
george
washington
added
to
the
form
of
presidential
oath
prescribed
by
article
ii
of
the
constitution
that
concluding
words
“so
help
me
god.”
the
supreme
court
under
john
marshall
opened
its
sessions
with
the
prayer
“god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court."
the
first
congress
instituted
the
practice
of
beginning
its
legislative
sessions
with
a
prayer.
the
same
week
that
congress
submitted
the
establishment
clause
as
part
of
the
bill
of
rights
for
ratification
by
the
states;
it
enacted
legislation
providing
for
paid
chaplains
in
the
house
of
senate.
the
day
after
the
first
amendment
was
proposed,
the
same
congress
that
had
proposed
it
requested
the
president
to
proclaim
“a
day
of
public
thanksgiving
and
prayer
to
be
observed
by
acknowledging
with
grateful
hearts
the
many
and
signal
favors
of
almighty
god."
president
washington
authored
the
first
thanksgiving
proclamation
shortly
thereafter
devoting
november
26,
1789
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
“to
the
service
of
that
great
and
glorious
being
who
is
the
beneficent
author
of
all
the
good
that
is,
that
was,
or
that
will
be.”
i
could
add
to
these
examples
many
other
official
and
quasi-official
indications
of
the
compatibility
with
the
establishment
clause
of
expressions
of
belief
in
god.
today’s
majority
opinion
brings
forward
no
official
or
quasi-official
statement
expressing
what
the
majority
says
to
be
the
contrary
view,
only
letters
and
statements
of
individual
framers.
some
of
which
are
contradicted
by
the
actions
that
those
framers
themselves
took
when
they
were
in
official
office.
there
is
moreover
no
indication
that
america's
views
on
the
official
acknowledgment
of
god
today
are
any
different
from
what
they
were
in
1789.
presidents
continue
to
conclude
the
presidential
oath
with
the
words,
“so
help
me
god”
and
to
wish
you
thanksgiving
proclamations
calling
for
thanks
to
god.
our
legislatures
state
and
national
continue
to
open
their
sessions
with
prayers
led
by
official
chaplains.
the
sessions
of
this
court
continue
to
open
with
the
prayer
“god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.”
invocation
of
the
almighty
by
our
public
figures
at
all
levels
of
the
government
remains
common
place.
our
coinage
there
is
the
model
“in
god
we
trust”
and
less
than
three
years
ago
an
active
congress
adapted
unanimously
by
the
senate
and
with
only
five
nays
in
the
house
of
representatives
criticized
a
federal
court
opinion
that
had
held
the
words
under
“god”
in
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
be
unconstitutional.
with
all
of
this
reality
and
much
more
scarring
it
in
the
face
how
can
the
court
possibly
assert
as
it
does
in
today’s
opinion
that
“the
first
amendment
mandates
governmental
neutrality
between
religion
and
non-religion”,
manifesting
a
purpose
to
favor
adherence
to
religion
generally
is
unconstitutional.
who
says
so?
surely
not
the
words
of
the
constitution,
surely
not
the
history
and
traditions
that
reflect
our
society’s
constant
understanding
of
those
words,
surely
not
even
the
current
sense
of
american
society
nothing
stands
behind
the
court's
assertion
that
governmental
affirmation
of
america’s
belief
in
god
is
unconstitutional
except
the
court’s
own
say
so,
citing
as
support
only
the
unsubstantiated
say
so
of
earlier
courts
going
back
no
further
than
the
mid
20th
century.
it
is
moreover
a
thoroughly
discredited
say
so.
it
is
discredit
to
begin
with
because
a
majority
of
the
justices
on
the
current
court
including
at
least
one
member
of
today’s
majority
have
in
separate
opinions
repudiated
the
so-called
lemon
test
that
embodies
the
supposed
principle
of
neutrality
between
religion
and
irreligion,
and
it
is
discredited
because
the
court
has
not
had
the
courage
or
the
full
of
heartiness
to
apply
the
neutrality
principle
consistently.
today’s
opinion
admits
that
it
does
not
rest
upon
consistently
applied
principle.
in
a
revealing
footnote
the
court
acknowledges
that
the
establishment
clause
doctrine
it
purports
to
be
applying
“lacks
the
comfort
of
categorical
absolutes.”
what
the
court
means
by
this
euphemism
is
that
sometimes
the
court
chooses
to
decide
cases
on
the
principle
that
government
cannot
favor
religion
and
sometimes
it
does
not.
for
example,
the
court
has
approved
the
exemption
of
houses
of
worship
from
property
taxes.
it
has
approved
a
program
allowing
students
to
absent
themselves
from
public
school
in
order
to
take
religion
classes
and
it
has
exempted
religious
organizations
from
generally
applicable
prohibitions
of
religious
discrimination.
indeed,
it
has
even
approved
post
lemon
government
led
prayer
to
god
permitting
a
state
legislature's
practice
of
paying
a
chaplain
to
lead
it
in
prayer
at
the
opening
of
legislative
sessions.
what
could
possibly
be
the
court’s
reason
for
occasionally
ignoring
the
neutrality
principle?
i
suggest
that
it
is
the
instinct
for
self-preservation
and
the
recognition
that
the
court
cannot
go
too
far
down
the
road
of
a
judge
enforce
neutrality
that
contradicts
both
historical
fact
and
current
practice
without
losing
the
willingness
of
the
people
to
accept
its
interpretation
of
the
constitution
as
definitive
in
preference
to
the
contrary
interpretation
of
the
democratically
elected
branches.
besides
appealing
to
the
demonstratively
false
principle
that
the
government
cannot
favor
religion
over
irreligion,
today’s
opinion
suggest
that
the
posting
of
the
ten
commandments
violates
the
principle
that
the
government
cannot
favor
one
religion
over
another.
that
is
indeed
a
valid
principle
where
public
aid
or
assistance
to
religion
is
concerned
or
where
the
free
exercise
of
religion
is
at
issue
but
it
necessarily
applies
and
has
always
applied
in
a
more
limited
sense
to
public
acknowledgment
of
the
creator.
if
religion
in
the
public
forum
had
to
be
entirely
non-denominational,
there
could
be
no
religion
in
the
public
forum
at
all.
one
cannot
say
the
word
god
or
the
almighty,
one
cannot
offer
public
supplication
or
thanksgiving
without
contradicting
the
beliefs
of
some
people
that
there
are
many
gods
or
that
god
or
the
gods
pay
no
attention
to
human
affairs.
with
respect
to
the
public
acknowledgment
of
religious
belief,
it
is
entirely
clear
from
our
nation’s
historical
practices
and
its
practices
today
that
there
is
a
distance
between
the
acknowledgment
of
a
single
creator
and
the
establishment
of
a
religion.
the
former
is
as
the
court
itself
said
in
the
case
appproving
legislator
prayers
“a
tolerable
acknowledgment
of
beliefs
widely
held
among
the
people
of
this
country.
the
three
most
popular
religions
in
the
united
states,
christianity,
judaism,
and
islam
which
combined
a
count
for
97.9%
of
all
believers
are
monotheistic.
all
of
them
moreover,
islam
included,
believe
that
the
ten
commandments
were
given
by
god
to
moses
and
are
divine
prescriptions
for
a
virtuous
life.
publicly
honoring
the
ten
commandments
is
thus
indistinguishable
in
so
far
as
discrimination
against
other
religious
is
concerned
from
publicly
honoring
god.
both
practices
are
recognized
across
such
a
broad
and
diverse
range
of
the
population
that
they
cannot
reasonably
be
understood
as
a
government
endorsement
of
a
particular
religious
viewpoint.
the
court
today
fails
to
recognize
that
in
the
context
of
public
acknowledgements
of
one
god
or
of
the
ten
commandments,
there
are
legitimate
competing
interests.
on
the
one
hand,
the
interest
of
a
minority,
the
religious
minority
and
not
feeling
excluded,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
interest
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
religious
believers
in
being
able
to
give
god
thanks
and
supplication
as
a
people
and
with
respect
to
our
national
endeavors.
our
national
tradition
has
resolved
that
conflict
in
favor
of
the
majority.
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
change
a
disposition
that
accounts
many
americans
think
for
the
phenomenon
remarked
upon
in
a
quotation
attributed
to
various
authors
including
bismarck
but
which
i
prefer
to
associate
with
charles
de
gaulle,
“god
watches
over
little
children,
drunkards,
and
the
united
states
of
america."
