mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
stevens
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
this
court
is
a
setting
of
law
in
a
courthouse
and
a
display
on
law
that
contains
the
universally
recognized
symbol
of
law.
despite
the
fact
that
the
deck
law
occupies
only
one
tenth
of
this
otherwise
secular
display,
the
sixth
circuit
struck
it
down.
the
court
focused
solely
on
the
religious
aspect
of
the
ten
commandments
and
that's
aired
by
ignoring
the
overall
context.
the
ten
commandments
is
unlike
most
any
other
acknowledgment.
it
is
in
a
category
essentially
all
by
itself.
it
is
thematic
in
common
places
in
courthouses
while
nativity
scenes
and
menorahs
occur
occasionally
and
often
gratuitously
on
public
property.
the
ten
commandments
occurs
quite
frequently
and
has
for
more
than
a
century
in
courthouses
all
over
this
nation.
it
is
associated
with
courthouses
for
a
clear
historic
reason,
because
the
ten
commandments
has
played
an
influential
role
in
american
law
and
government
and
our
system
of
law
in
this
country.
the
context
in
this
case
is
clearly
important.
yet
the
sixth
circuit--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--several.
the
display
in
this
case
has
three
different
phases.
first
it
was
the
stand-alone
ten
commandments.
they
were
sued.
they
could
have
defended
that
but
they
chose
instead
to
switch
rather
than
fight
because
they
wanted
to
try
to
comply
with
this
court's
establishment
clause
jurisprudence,
to
try
to
figure
out
how
to
be
able
to
display
this
particular
document.
they
stepped,
however,
on
a
land
mine
admittedly
with
this
second
display.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
they
were
trying
to
do
the
best
that
they
could,
trying
to
follow
this
ever
bending
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
especially
in
the
area
of
displays.
remember
this
was
back
in
1999.
at
that
time,
there
were
less
than
a
handful
of
reported
decisions
ever
in
this
country
on
the
ten
commandments.
the
first
was
in
1973,
stone
was
in
1980
and
there
were
a
couple
of
others.
there
are
only
30
reported
cases
in
the
country
or
so
and
23
of
those
happened
from
1999
to
the
present
so
they
didn't
have
really
any
guidance.
they
were
trying
to
follow
lynch
and
allegheny
as
best
as
they
could
but
these
are
governmental
officials.
they're
not
jurists
schooled
in
the
law.
and
admittedly
they
made
a
mistake.
but
what
they
have
now
is
the
foundations
display
and
as
the
district
court
recognized,
it
is
fundamentally
different
than
any
previous
display.
like
this
court's
decision
in
the
sunday
law
cases,
even
though
it
may
have
started
off
for
a
religious
purpose,
the
sunday
laws
were
continued
to
be
retained
for
secular
reasons.
in
this
case--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--we're
saying
that
in
this
case,
the
purpose
is
about
the
display
of
law.
we
also
have
an
argument
later
on
that
this
court
should
reconsider
the
purpose
prong
in
generally
as
it
relates
to
the
lemon
test.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
yes,
your
honor.
the
district
court
actually
recognized
that
one
of
the
omni
intended
effects
of
the
history
is
to
educate
everyone
of
the
difference
between
an
acknowledgment
and
an
establishment.
and
even
if
they
had
a
religious
purpose
under
the
second
display,
that
religious
purpose
has
been
buried
and
has
been
abandoned.
they
voluntarily
accepted
the--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--no,
we're
not.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
and
that's
why
we
said
that
they
could
have
defended
the
individual
first
display
which
was
the
ten
commandments
alone,
in
part
because
it
is
the
uniquely
recognized
historic
symbol
of
law
and
is
commonplace
and
thematic
in
the
courthouse.
they
could
have
defended
when
they
were
originally
sued
on
that
basis
alone
but
instead
they
chose
to
modify
the
display.
and
when
they
modified
the
display,
it
had
excerpted
sections
around
it.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
your
honor,
they
must
be
able
to
change
their
misstep,
if
it
was
a
misstep,
that
they
had.
otherwise,
that
past
taint
would
be
superimposed
on
the
foundation's
display
forever
and
the
question
would
be--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--the
intent
has
certainly
broadened
in
this
case
and
there
is
clearly
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
foundations
display
is
solely
purposed
or
intended
to
be
a
religious
display.
in
fact,
even
the
respondents
of
amici
that
wrote
against
us
said
that
on
the
face
of
this
display,
it
appears
secular
in
nature.
it
does.
in
fact,
the
foundations
display
not
only
has
numerous
other
documents
of
which
the
ten
commandments
is
only
one
tenth
of
these
many
other
document
but
it
also
has
a
foundations
document
that
says
what
the
purpose
is
about.
there
is
only
two
places
that
talk
about
the
purpose
on
the
foundations
display.
on
the
document
itself,
which
says
it's
a
display
about
some
documents
that
influenced
american
law
and
government,
and
the
undisputed
testimony
that
these
are
documents
that
reflect
documents
that
have
influenced
american
law
and
government.
that's
the
record
before
this
court
on
the
foundations
display
and
that
is
fundamentally
different--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--that
is
arguably
constitutional--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--your
honor,
there
was
no
resolution,
justice
o'connor,
for
the
first
display.
it
just
went
up.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
the
purpose
of
that
first
one
is
like
it
is
in
many
courthouses
around
the
country.
both
courthouses
have
numerous
documents
of
his
historical
nature
along
the
walls,
284
just
in
the
curia
alone.
and
in
pulaski,
many,
many
documents,
when
they
celebrated
their
200th
anniversary
in
1999.
so
that
was
one
of
many
documents
that's
there
and
that
was
a
document
of
the
ten
commandments
that
was
meant
to
show
the
historic
nature
of
the
ten
commandments,
how
it
has
in
fact
influenced
american
law
and
government
in
the
appropriate
setting
of
a
courthouse.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
the
original
one.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
it
was
just
the
document
itself
in
a
frame
on
a
wall
amongst
almost
300
other
documents.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
scalia,
because
that
in
fact
is
an
acknowledgement
that
is
part
of
our
history;
like
in
marsh
versus
chambers.
that's
why
this
court
has
authorized
prayers
before
legislative
sessions
or
suggested
that
the
national
motto
is
constitutional
because
indeed
we
are
a
religious
people
as
this
court
has
said
more
than
five
times.
we
are
a
religious
people.
our
institutions
do
presuppose
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
correct,
your
honor.
justice
kennedy,
it
would
not
inflict
any
harm
because
in
this
case,
it's
a
passive
display
in
a
courthouse
in
a
hallway
and
you
could
simply
walk
past
that
and
avert
your
eyes
once
you
see
this.
it
inflicts
no
harm,
it
does
not--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--justice
ginsburg,
the
ten
commandments
is
a
unique
symbol
in
the
area
of
acknowledgment
because
of
its
historic
role
in
influencing
our
law
and
government.
it
is
displayed
in
this
context
for
that
unique
role.
it
does
have
some
statements
in
there
about
god
but,
frankly,
very
few
when
you
look
at
the
overall
context.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
sure.
and
those
are
definitely
and
decidedly
religious.
there
is
no
question
that
the
ten
commandments
is
a
religious
document.
there
is
also
no
question
that
it
has
influenced
our
american
law.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
they're
quite
shorter.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
justice
breyer,
it
is
not
wrong
to
end
with
any
more
than
it
would
be
wrong
to
begin
with
the
sunday
laws
based
upon
the
sabbath
commandment
which
was
a
commandment
about
worship
and
the
end
with
the
secular
reason
for
keeping
those
particular
laws
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
mcgowan.
and
in
this
case,
even
if
they
started
off
with
a
decidedly
and
only
religious
purpose,
which
we
contend
they
did
not,
they
did
not
end
with
one
and
they've
got
to,
as
governmental
officials,
be
able
to
adjust
their
missteps
whenever
they
step
on
a
constitutional
land
mine
that
is
sometimes
blurry
and
confusing
to
them.
that's
what
they
tried
to
do
in
this
case,
the
best
efforts
to
try
to
follow
this
court's
decision
when
there
was
really
no
specific
guidelines
for
them
to
be
guiding
their
direction.
the
ten
commandments
that
justice
stevens,
you
had
mentioned
about
the
versions,
the
versions
i
don't
believe,
with
all
due
respect,
are
relevant
in
this
case
or
any
other
case
regarding
the
ten
commandments
because
if
that
were
the
case,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
teach
the
bible
in
an
appropriate
context
because
there
are
so
many
different
versions
and
yet
stone
and
schempp
has
indicated
that
you
indeed
can
teach
even
the
biblical
text
with
all
of
its
multiple
versions.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
we
would
believe
that,
in
fact,
in
this
case,
i
don't
even
think
they
thought
about
whether
there
were
different
versions
but
we
certainly
believe
that
they
could
have
the
text
there
and
talk
about
the
ten
commandments.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that's
in
a
school
context
which
this
is
a
courthouse
context.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
not
one
to
one
but
i
think
the
version
issue,
if
there
is
a
version
that
flunks
the
test,
it
would
be
this
court's
south
frieze.
it's
actually
in
hebrew
and
it
speaks
only
to
jewish
people.
but
yet
that's
not
sectarian
such
that
it
violates
the
establishment
clause.
that's
the
acknowledgment
as
opposed
to
an
establishment.
justice
stevens,
if
you
would
like,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
justice
stevens,
the
argument
before
this
court
was
unlike
anything
that
went
down
in
the
district
court
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
because
never
was
a
resolution
ever
mentioned.
never
did
the
district
court
or
the
sixth
circuit
ever
discuss
a
resolution.
it
was
not
mentioned
in
this
court
until
this
answer
brief
by
respondents
was
filed.
it
is
not
part
of
the
district
court's
decision,
it
was
not
part
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
said
that
what
imprinted
every
action
thereafter
with
defiance
in
a
taint
is
the
mere
posting
of
the
first
display.
there
was
no
resolution
for
that
display,
none
is
needed.
there
is
no
resolution
for
the
foundations
display.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
for
the
second
display,
yes,
your
honor,
there
was.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
it
is
that
resolution
but
it
is
specific
to
the
second
display
because
it
specifically
mentions
what
kind
of
documents
are
in
that
display.
it
is
not
a
general
display
regarding
posting
of
documents.
in
this
case,
when
the
court--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--it
was
not
amended
because
it
was
not...
it
was
relevant
and
fact-specific
in
the
display
itself.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
no,
your
honor.
what's
the
last
expression
is
the
foundations
display
which
clearly
a
reasonable
observer
would
see.
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
regarding--
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
--there
is
not
a
new
resolution.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
that
one
died,
your
honor,
with
the
court's
ruling.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
presumably.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
what
happened
to
it.
whether
it
was
repealed
or
not.
but
it
was
specific
factually
only
to
that
second
display,
not
to
the
foundations
display
which
the
district
court
found
was
fundamentally
different.
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
regarding
the
history
of
purpose,
we
would
suggest,
justice
o'connor,
your
suggestion
in
the
wallace,
that
if
there
is
any
doubt
regarding
purpose,
to
look
to
the
effects
prong.
and
i
think
when
you
look
to
the
effects
prong,
a
reasonable
observer
will
see
that
this
is
a
constitutional
display.
this
case
is
one
in
which
the
sixth
circuit
drew
the
most
difficult
taint,
it
imposed
it
in
a
subsequent
action
in
the
most
difficult
area
of
the
establishment
clause
and
clearly
the
public
officials
have
substantially
and
fundamentally
changed.
they
can't
live
under
this
taint
forever.
they
tried
but
they
could
to
correct
their
way.
they
tried
what
they
could
to
display
this
in
a
constitutional
manner
so
that
anyone
passing
by
would
see
this
as
one
document
among
many
others.
in
addition
to
the
display
itself,
with
all
the
other
hundreds
of
other
documents
that
are
on
the
wall,
that
this
display
has
a
specific
stated
purpose.
mr.
mathew
d.
staver
yes,
the
preliminary
injunction.
if
the
fact
that
the
resolution
is
technically
latent
on
the
books,
they
will
repeal
that,
they
repudiate
that
resolution.
thank
you.
