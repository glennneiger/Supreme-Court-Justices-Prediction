are
you
saying
that
the
purpose
is
neutral
or
that
the
purpose
doesn't
matter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
your
position
that
no
real
harm
is
inflicted
on
people
who
do
not
agree
with
that
message?
justice

m.

suppose
you
had
a
county
100
miles
away
or
a
state,
a
different
state,
and
the
same
display
was
put
on
and
the
recitation
was...
and
it
was
a
sincere
recitation,
that
the
government
simply
wanted
to
recognize
that
the
10
commandments
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
civic
life
of
our
people.
then
you
have...
they're
each
up
for
five
years
and
five
years
later,
some
school
kids
wander
by
one
and
they
wander
by
the
other.
in
your
view,
from
what
you're
telling
me,
the
commandments
are
permitted
in
one
location
and
not
the
other?
i
mean,
that's
the
necessary
purport
of
your
argument.
you
may
not
think
that
either
of
them
are
valid
but
on
this
prong
of
the
argument,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
differentiate,
i
just
don't
understand
that.
