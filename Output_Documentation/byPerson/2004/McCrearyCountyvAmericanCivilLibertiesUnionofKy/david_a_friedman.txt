mr.
david
a.
friedman
justice
stevens
and
may
it
please
the
court,
three
times
in
the
course
of
a
year,
mccreary
and
pulaski
county
posted
ten
commandments
displays.
they
variously
describe
the
ten
commandments
as
the
precedent
legal
code
of
kentucky,
the
central
historic
legal
document
of
the
state
and,
finally,
as
the
moral
background
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
foundation
of
our
legal
system.
in
the
course
of
the
litigation,
they
announced
that
under
current
law,
they
announced
to
the
court
that
uncurrent
law,
america
is
a
christian
nation
and
they
acknowledge
that
the
purpose
of
their
second
display
was
to
demonstrate
america's
christian
heritage.
in
this
context,
it
is
our
position
that
the
current
courthouse
display
reveals
both
a
purpose
and
an
effect
to
endorse
religion.
this
court
has
repeatedly
and
most
recently
in
the
santa
fe
case
made
clear
that
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
content,
the
context
and
the
history
of
a
display
in
order
to
gauge
whether
or
not
there
is
a
true
secular
purpose
or
whether
or
not
an
asserted
secular
purpose
is
a
sham.
we
submit
here
that
on
this
record,
the
district
court
and
particularly
in
the
context
of
an
appeal
from
a
preliminary
injunction,
which
we
have
here,
that
the
district
court
had
ample
evidence
from
which
it
could
conclude
that
the
asserted
secular
purpose
of
mccreary
and
pulaski
counties
was
indeed
a
sham.
the
counties
announced
their
purpose
not
only
in
the
content
of
the
display
itself
but
in
the
resolution
that
the
counties
enacted,
the
identical
resolutions
that
the
counties
enacted
within
weeks
after
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit.
and
in
that
resolution,
the
counties
make
clear
that
they
relied
on
and
cited
approvingly
the
kentucky
legislature's
reference
to
jesus
christ
as
the
prince
of
ethics.
they
made
clear
that
they
supported
the
fight
of
alabama
supreme
court
justice
roy
moore
against
the
aclu.
they
made
absolutely
clear
in
their
legal
papers
that
they
deemed
this
to
be
a
christian
nation
under
current
law
and
they
made
clear
that
they
absolutely
intended
and
believed
they
had
the
right
to
display
the
ten
commandments.
they
did
so
not
in
a
display
of
history.
they
asserted
and
they
intended
to
do
so
because
of
the
religious
nature
of
the
ten
commandments.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
ten
commandments
portrays
a
religious
point
of
view
and
is
profoundly
religious.
the
court
said
so
in
stone.
there
is
no
serious
question
about
that.
the
question
then
here
is
whether
or
not
the
counties,
in
their
current
display,
have
done
anything
to
sufficiently
neutralize
the
endorsing
message
that
is
contained
in
this
record.
and
we
submit
it
has
not
done
so.
it
now
announces
that
the
ten
commandments
are
the
foundation
of
our
legal
system,
not
just
that
religion
is
but
that
the
ten
commandments,
a
particular
religious
code,
the
word
of
god,
it
asserts
is
the
foundation
of
our
legal
system.
it
asserts
that
the
ten
commandments,
the
revealed
word
of
god,
provides
the
moral
background
of
the
declaration
of
independence.
we
think
it
clear
that
the
content
of
the
ten
commandments
and
the
content
of
the
declaration
of
independence
deal
with
substantially
different
topics.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think
to
an
extent
there
is
a
differentiation
because
this
court
has
made
clear
that
any
assessment
must
depend
on
context.
there
is
no
fixed
per
se
rule
but
rather,
the
context
one
must
look
at
both
the
purpose
and
the
effect.
in
gauging
the
purpose,
one
looks
at
both
the
litigation
history,
the
social
facts,
the
content
and
any
changes.
here
the
district
court
had
not
only
the
display
itself
but
it
had
the
announced
purpose
of
the
county.
it
therefore
was
in
a
unique
position
to
gauge
the
purpose
of
the...
the
true
purpose
of
these
counties.
moreover,
it
was
in
a
unique
position
to
gauge
the
effects
that
the
reasonable
observer
in
these
small
rural
kentucky
counties,
the
reasonable
observer's
assessment
of
this
particular
display.
and
the
court...
mccreary
county
is
a
county
with
only
17,000
people.
whitley
city,
the
county
seat,
which
is
not
even
incorporated,
has
1,100
people.
the
district
court
from
its
chambers
in
london,
kentucky
was
well
situated
to
gauge
whether
or
not
the
reasonable
observer,
knowing
the
litigation
history
of
this
case
and
knowing
the
changes
in
the
forum
and
the
context
of
this
display,
would
perceive
this
to
be
a
neutral
recitation
of
history
or
simply
the
third
in
a
series
of
efforts
by
this
county
government
to
post
the
ten
commandments
because
that
is
what
it
wanted
to
post.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think
it's
a
question
of
degree
and
while
over
time
the
importance
of
the
purpose
may
diminish,
the
purpose
does
not
fully
diminish
and
the
effect
does
not
change
substantially.
it
is
a
question
of
degree,
it
is
a
question
of
line
drawing.
here
there
is
not
an
effort
to
incorporate
the
ten
commandments
into
a
neutral
display
or
a
neutral
course
of
study
such
as
a
compare
and
contrast
of
ancient
moral
codes
or
a
comparative
religion
course
such
as
many
of
us
have
taken
and
schools
clearly
can
offer.
it
is
not
a
neutral
display
of
law
givers
like
the
frieze
in
this
court.
it
asserts
the
primacy
of
the
ten
commandments.
it
says
the
ten
commandments
are
the
moral
background
of
the
declaration
of
independence.
it
doesn't
say
there
is
some
commonality
between
the
ten
commandments
and
some
american
laws.
it
talks
not
only
about
law.
it
talks
about
our
system
of
government.
it
says
the
ten
commandments,
the
revealed
word
of
god
is
the
moral
foundation
of
the
declaration
of
independence.
that
in
itself
is
an
endorsement
of
religion
in
this
context
and
i
don't
think
that
can
dissipate
over
time.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
it's
the
difference
between
acknowledgment
and
endorsement.
of
course
counties
and
other
governments
can
acknowledge
the
role
that
religion
played
in
history.
that
is
very
different
from
acknowledging
religion
as
a
general
matter
and
asserting
that
a
specific
code
that
is
central
to
specific
religions
is
the
one...
not
only
the
one
religious
source
but
the
one
source,
religious
or
moral,
that
provide...
religious
or
secular
that
provides
the
moral
background
of
the
declaration
of
independence.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
what
this
display
says--
mr.
david
a.
friedman
--whatever
the
merit
of
that
statement,
that
is
not
what
these
counties
have
said.
what
these
counties
have
said
in
their
resolutions
is
that
the
ten
commandments
are
the
precedent
legal
code
of
kentucky
and
the
central
historic
legal
document
of
the
state.
what
they
have
said
in
this
display
itself,
in
the
explanation
of
the
display,
that
they
are
the
moral
background
of
the
declaration
of
independence,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others,
in
effect.
when
you
say
the,
it
doesn't
say
one
of.
it
says
it
is
the
foundation
of
our
legal
system.
it
doesn't
say
it
had
an
influence
on
some
of
our
laws.
it
asserts
the
primacy,
the
actual
text
of
this
display
asserts
the
primacy
of
the
ten
commandments.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
an
element
that
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
must
accept
and
gauge
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
announced
secular
purpose
is
indeed
a
true
purpose
or
is
a
sham.
where
we're
talking
about
a
close
time
period,
here
three
displays
in
less
than
a
year
by
the
same
officials
of
the
same
county
trying
to
post
the
same
document,
this
case
becomes
very
close
to
the
santa
fe
independent
school
district
case
where
it's
a
moving
target
in
direct
response
to
pending
litigation
as
an
effort
to
try
to
get
the
same
end
result
and
changing
the
operative
facts
just
slightly
in
the
hope
that
eventually
it
will
be
right.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
the
resolution
was
enacted
in
early
december
1999,
a
couple
of
weeks
after
the
display.
it
has
never
been
rescinded.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
it
is
still
on
the
books.
a
point
is
made
in
the
reply
brief,
and
it
is
accurate
that
it
is
is
not
a
binding
resolution,
it
encourages
the
county
judge
executive
to
post
the
ten
commandments
as
part
of
a
historic
display.
it
doesn't
say
post
a
display
of
documents
and
have
a
county
judge
choose
to
post
the
ten
commandments.
the
initial
paragraph
of
the
resolution
makes
clear
that
it
encourages
the
county
judge
to
post
the
ten
commandments
and
then
as
part
of
a
historic
display.
the
county
judge
did
that.
the
district
court
enjoined
that
display.
the
county
appealed
that
injunction
and
then,
after
getting
new
lawyers,
dropped
its
appeal.
soon
after
that,
the
county
posted
a
third
display,
again,
the
ten
commandments
with
what
it
called
historic
documents,
leaving
aside
how
the
stars
spangled
banner
or
the
national
motto
as
a
historic
document.
what
it
did
is
wrap
the
ten
commandments
in
the
three
or
four
secular
documents
that
we
all
clearly
acknowledge
as
the
root
of
the
american
system
of
government.
it
did
so
pursuant
to
the
same
resolution.
there
has
never
been
another
resolution,
it
has
not
been
rescinded.
the
resolution
is
there.
it
cites
jesus
christ
as
the
prince
of
ethics,
it
cites
legislative
allusions
to
jesus
christ.
i
think
the
resolution,
which
is
cited
in
the
joint
appendix
of
the
docket
number,
makes
it
clear
that
the
purpose
of
this
county
was
to
post
the
ten
commandments
and
to
do
so
because
of
the
religious
nature
of
the
ten
commandments
because
of
the
primacy
in
its
view
of
the
ten
commandments.
that's
what
it
focused
on.
that's
what
this
litigation
history
has
revealed
throughout
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found
at
least
at
the
preliminary
injunction
stage,
which
is
where
we
still
are.
there
has
been
no
evidence
taken
in
the
case,
no
discovery
taken
in
the
case
to
suggest
anything
other
than
what
the
district
court
found.
and
on
this
record,
i
submit
that
there
can
be
no
conclusion
other
than
that
the
purpose
of
the
county
in
posting
the
series
of
displays
was
to
post
the
ten
commandments
because
of
their
religious
nature
and
the
effect
on
the
reasonable
observer
who
knew
what
was
going
on,
who
was
there
to
see
what
was
transpiring
in
this
small
county
was
clear
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
doesn't
operate
in
a
vacuum.
and
this
court
has
made
clear
that
courts
cannot
turn
a
blind
eye
to
a
sham
secular
purpose.
the
district
court
not
only
saw
the
displays,
heard
the
arguments
of
counsel,
saw
the
resolutions
of
the
district
court,
of
the
fiscal
court.
the
fiscal
court
is
the
legislative
branch
of
government
in
kentucky.
the
district
court
also
was
there
in
the
community
and
could
see
both
the
public
reaction,
the
letters
to
the
editor,
the
keep
the
ten
commandments
signs
on
yards
throughout
the
county.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
the
district
court
was
well
situated
to
understand
the
social
fact,
historical
record
and
arguments
of
both
the
lawyers
and
the
parties
and
the
statements
of
the
parties.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
joint
appendix
page
1,
number
5,
and
it's
exhibit
1
attached
to
it.
and
that's
for
one
of
the
counties.
the
other
one
is...
and
these
are
the
docket
entries.
the
document
itself
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
the
other
county
is
joint
appendix
page
28,
number
6.
they're
both
exhibit
1s
attached
to
those
documents.
those
documents
are
the
county's
motions
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
itself,
no.
the
resolution
is
not
in
there.
the
citation
to
it
from
the
index
is
there.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
it
is
in
the
record.
it
was
submitted
in
fact
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
they
submitted
the
resolution
in
support
of
their
arguments
defending
the
second
display,
the
display
that
surrounded
the
ten
commandments
with
the
religious
text.
they
made
clear
in
that
brief
that
they
were
asserting
their
right
to
display
the
ten
commandments
as
part
of
their
argument
that
the
purpose
was
to
demonstrate
america's
christian
heritage.
i
submit
that
in
that
brief,
in
that
resolution,
in
the
repeated
statements
of
the
county
officials
and
of
their
counsel,
the
district
court
was
well
within
its
discretion
to
determine
that
the
purpose
here
was
religious,
was
not
secular
and
that
the
effect,
as
viewed
by
the
reasonable
observer,
was
religious...
was
to
endorse
religion,
not
secular.
if
there
are
additional
questions,
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
them.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would.
it
would
be
a
closer
question
but
in
this
context,
what
we
have
is
the
assertion
that
the
ten
commandments
are
the
source,
the
moral
background
of
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
foundation
of
our
legal
system.
it
is
not
incorporating
the
ten
commandments
as
part
of
a
neutral
course
of
study.
it
is
not
like
having
moses
along
with
15
other
or
15
law
givers.
it
is
the
assertion
of
the
primacy
of
the
ten
commandments.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think
it
makes
it
an
easier
case
when
it
asserts
this
is
the
one
rather
than
one
of
several
or
one
of
many.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think
it
depends
on
the
content
and
context
of
the
display.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
i
think
the
court's
endorsement
test
has
stood
the
test
of
time
and
has
worked
well.
it
allows
the
district
courts
that
are
most
familiar
with
what
is
actually
happening
to
look
at
both
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
a
particular
display.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
an
ironclad
rule.
there
can
be
presumptions.
there
can
be
brighter
line
tests
perhaps.
but
i
think
ultimately--
mr.
david
a.
friedman
--we
think
that
test
can
work
very
well
in
a
context
like
this
where
we're
talking
about
the
display
of
religious
texts
rather
than
just
symbols.
and
the
point
i
think
is
well
worth
considering,
that
we
assume
that
when
people
post
signs
or
displays,
bumper
stickers,
buttons,
that
they
endorse
the
content
of
that
text
and
that
the
presumption
then
would
place
a
burden
on
government
to
make
sure
that
it
is
neutralizing
the
endorsing
effect
of
displaying
text.
i
think
that
is
a
very
workable
test
in
a
context
like
this
where
we're
talking
about
the
posting
of
core
religious
texts.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
it
does
depend
entirely
on
context,
to
be
sure,
but
symbols
are
subject
to
alternative
interpretation.
text
is
not.
or
text
rarely
is.
and
text
such
as
this,
religious
text,
cannot
be
seen
as
anything
other
than
the
revealed
word
of
god.
i
mean,
here
we
have
120
words
in
the
first
four
commandments,
142
in
the
first
five
commandments
of
this
display
that
is
a
profound,
detailed
explication
of
core
religious
content,
core
religious
meaning.
mr.
david
a.
friedman
there
is
no
reason
why
it
couldn't
be
applied
just
as
well.
my
point
was
simply
that
it's
even
easier
to
do
it
when
there
is
text.
the
court
doesn't
need
to
go
so
far
as
to
decide
whether
to
apply
it
to
both
text
and
symbol,
although
it
certainly
could.
it
need
only
go
so
far
as
say
when
government
posts
religious
texts,
it
must
be
presumed
to
endorse
the
content
of
that
text.
it's
a
little
more
difficult
when
you're
talking
about
symbols,
depending
on
what
the
symbols
are.
some
symbols
are
far
more
sectarian
such
as
the
cross,
such
as
the
star
of
david,
than
are
other
symbols.
at
least
when
there
is
text
involved,
one
presumes
that
the
display
of
text
is
an
endorsement
of
the
content
of
that
text
unless
the
content
and
the
context
make
clear
that
it
is
neutralizing.
the
examples
are
obvious.
the
display
of
religious
art
in
a
government
owned
art
museum,
the
playing
of
religious
music
by
a
government
symphony
orchestra,
the
context
of
the
orchestra,
the
context
of
the
museum
are
sufficient
to
neutralize
the
religious
message
that
is
contained
in
the
display
itself.
here...
and
the
same
thing
i
think
would
be
said
of
a
comparative
religion
course
or
a
compare
and
contrast
ancient
moral
code
course.
there
there
is
not
an
endorsement
of
a
particular
code,
a
particular
text
but
rather
a
neutral
educational
display
about
several
alternative
ones.
that
is
different
from
taking
one
religious
code,
one
revealed
word
of
god,
placing
it
next
to
the
revered
documents
that
frame
the
american
republic
and
saying,
these
are
all
alike,
these
are
worthy
of
equal
reverence.
that
is
simply
wrapping
the
ten
commandments
in
the
flag
and,
with
all
due
respect,
that
constitutes
endorsement.
thank
you.
