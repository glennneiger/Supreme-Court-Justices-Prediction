mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
display
of
historical
documents
here,
like
the
display
in
the
lynch
against
donnelly
case
of
the
creche,
may
include
a
religious
item
without
running
afoul
of
the
establishment
clause.
as
in
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
o'connor,
we
would
urge
you
not
to
consider
the
history
of
the
display.
you
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
pinette
case
made
the
point
that
in
the
context
of
accommodations,
the
inquiry
into
religious
purpose
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
and
you
urged
the
court
to
drop
it
in
that
context.
i
think
so
too
in
the
acknowledgment
context.
certainly
if
you
have
a
situation
where
you
don't
have...
i
think
in
the
acknowledgment
context
as
well,
a
focus
on
purpose
may
not
be
that
productive.
but
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
purpose--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
this
court
has
said
that
you
can
accommodate
religions.
they've
also
said
that
you
can
acknowledge
the
role
that
religion
has
played
in
our
society
and
i
think
in
both
contexts,
a
focus
on
purpose
is
probably
not
a
prudent
exercise
of
judicial
resources.
but
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
purpose
here
because
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
a
display
of
a
document
alone
in
the
first
instance
that
certainly
was
at
least
defensible
and
probably
constitutional,
yet
the
courts
below
got
off
on
the
wrong
foot
by
saying
that
the
first
display
was
open
defiance
of
this
court's
decision
in
stone
against
graham
and
i
think
this
court's
cases
themselves
suggest
that
the
contextual
differences
between
the
schoolhouse
and
the
courtroom
are
enough
to
make
the
display,
at
least
the
first
display,
not
in
open
defiance.
now
there
was
the
second
display
and
we
are
not
here
to
defend
the
second
display
but
that
was
the
display
that
was
in
reaction
to
the
lawsuit
filed
against
the
first
display.
now,
i
don't
know
if
that
second
display
was
the
product
of
bad
legal
advice
or
simply
frustration
at
the
first
lawsuit
being
filed
but
i
don't
think
it
should
make
a
constitutional
difference.
in
the
lynch
against
donnelly
case,
mayor
lynch,
after
the
aclu
filed
a
lawsuit
against
him,
had
a
rally
at
the
site
of
the
creche,
a
press
conference,
where
he
publicly
vowed
to
fight
to
keep
christ
in
christmas
and
then
he
led
city
workers
in
carols
and
said
they
should
sing
another
one
that
apparently
bothers
people.
yet
despite
that
adverse
reaction
to
the
litigation
being
filed
against
the
city
of
pawtucket,
this
court
upheld
the
display
and
although
the
dissent
did
focus
on
the
mayor's
crusade
to
keep
christ
in
christmas,
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinions
did
not.
and
i
think
that
is
the
proper
mode
of
analysis.
now,
the
second
point
i
think
is
should
these
counties
be
faulted
for
trying
to
bring
their
practices
in
compliance
with
the
constitution?
and
i
think
the
answer
there
is
clearly
not.
and
i
was
going
to
point
this
court
to
the
marsh
case
that's
been
talked
about
quite
a
bit.
one
of
the
things
that
as
professor
chemerinsky
said
about
the
marsh
case
that
this
court
emphasized
in
that
case
itself
and
in
subsequent
cases
is
the
fact
that
the
prayers
there
were
non-sectarian
in
the
sense
that
they
did
not
directly
invoke,
say,
christ.
but
that
actually
is
something
of
a
change
that
took
place
after
the
litigation
began.
prior
to
the
litigation,
there
were
explicit
references
to
christ
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
footnote
2
of
his
dissent
in
that
case.
but
the
state
of
nebraska,
after
they
had
a
lawsuit,
decided
let's
make
this
an
easier
case
for
the
court,
not
a
harder
case,
and
they
modified
their
conduct.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
souter,
i
have
two
points
in
response.
first
of
all,
what
i
think
would
be
a
crazy
way
of
having
a
jurisprudence
is
for
the
court
to
say
that
this
display
is
a
foundation
to
the
law
document,
it's
perfectly
constitutional
in
every
other
county
courthouse
in
kentucky
except
for
mccreary
county
and
pulaski
county
because
of
their
prior
conduct.
the
second
point
that
i
think
is
important
in
this
context
is
that
i
think
this
court's
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
is
already
difficult
enough
to
apply
without
creating
the
first
amendment
equivalent
of
covered
jurisdictions
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
would
be
my
point,
justice
souter,
but
i
also
think
independent
of
that
point,
it
is
also
not
a
particular
productive
jurisprudence
to
really
treat
municipalities
differently
because
the
mayor
in
one
case
may
have
started
with
the
creche
and
decided
to
add
the
wishing
well
or
in
the
other
case
started
with
the
wishing
well
and
added
the
creche.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
sense
that
if
they
end
up
in
the
same
place,
the
constitutional
rules
should
be
the
same.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
understand
the
jurisprudence
that
said
this
court
could
not
open
its
sessions
with
a
prayer
but
the
capitol
can.
now,
if
there
was
any
difference
drawn
at
all,
i
would
assume
it
would
be
a
difference
based
on
history.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
know,
it
depends
on
how
much
content
one
wants
to
give--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
as
i
said,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
if
there
were
a
difference
in
principle,
it
would
have
to
be
a
difference
based
on
history.
but
i
don't
think
there
is...
in
this
context,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
ginsburg,
i
suppose
if
the
federal
courts
decided
to
do
that,
we
would
probably
try
to
defend
them
on
establishment
clause
grounds.
i
don't
think,
though,
that...
i
think
that
would
obviously
be
a
much
tougher
case
than
the
posting
of
the
ten
commandments
in
the
outer
hallway
along
with
a
variety
of
other
documents
which
i
take
it
to
be
the
first
case
here.
and
then
the
final
display
that
the
court
has
before
it
is
actually
the
ten
commandments
in
the
context
of
the
other
secular
historical
documents.
and
i
think
that
kind
of
display
clearly
is
constitutional
for
the
reasons
that
the
display
was
constitutional
in
the
lynch
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
on
a
variety
of
occasions
has
chosen
to
simply
put
lemon
to
one
side
as
opposed
to
overtly
amending
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
don't.
i
think
it
would
be
prudent,
as
i
suggested
at
the
outset,
to
make
not
necessarily
a
full
amendment
and
eliminate
the
first
purpose
prong
of
lemon
but
at
least
in
the
acknowledgment
context
as
in
the
accommodation
context
we're
not
going
to
focus
on
that.
but
independent
of
that,
i
think
many
of
these
court's
cases
that
were
decided
even
under
lemon
acknowledge
the
principles
that
municipalities
should
be
rewarded,
not
punished,
for
trying
to
change
their
conduct
to
try
to
get
things
right.
in
abbington
against
schempp,
which
i
think
in
many
respects
is
a
precursor
to
lemon
because
it
talked
at
least
about
the
purpose
and
effects
test
and
i
gather
that's
about
all
that's
left
of
lemon.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
out
the
promise
that
it
might
be
permissible
for
the
government
to
have
some
use
of
the
bible
in
school.
now,
when
it
did
that,
it
didn't
except
out
abbington
township
and
said,
but
not
for
you,
abbington
township,
because
you
violated
the
purpose
prong.
the
sixth
circuit
here
has
adopted
a
rule
that's
essentially
once
mistaken,
always
condemned
and
we
don't
think
that
has
any
proper
place
in
this
court's
establishment
clause
jurisprudence.
