suppose
we
go
back
to
the
first
display.
if
all
that
was
there
was
the
ten
commandments,
now,
in
your
opinion,
was
that
constitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
just
that
first
display,
what
was
the
purpose
of
that
first
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
original
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
anything
there
that
said
we're
interested
in
history
and
what
we're
not
interested
in
is
having
this
on
the
wall
as...
to
encourage
people
to
study
the
bible
and
to
encourage
them
to
study
religion
and
to
understand
that
in
their
lives,
religion
should
be
important
and
this
very
solemn
secular
setting.
nonetheless,
religion
is
important.
was
there
anything
other
than
the
document
itself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
how
much
help
i
can
get
or
not
but
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
the
involvement
of
the
government,
is
the
government
involved
in
religion
when
it
posts
the
ten
commandments
alone?
yes,
of
course
it
is.
now,
there
could
be
a
purpose
to
it,
that
they
want
to
just
show
the
history
of
law
but
it's
all
by
itself
and
there
is
a
lot
more
history
than
that
and
context
may
matter
a
lot.
not
everybody
will
go
with
the
ten
commandments
just
by
itself
there
and
say,
well,
gee,
this
seems
to
go
too
far.
this
is
going
too
far.
why?
because
it
isn't
really
related
to
history,
it's
the
only
thing
up
there,
it's
involvement
in
religion,
so
forth.
now,
suppose
i
go
down
that
track
because
what
i'm
really
looking
for
is
a
key
as
to
what's
too
far
and
what's
not.
but
for
present
purposes,
let's
assume
it's
too
far.
now,
once
they've
gone
too
far
there,
the
next
thing
that
happens
is
they
keep
changing
it
but
they
change
it
pursuant
to
the
resolution
and
it
seems
as
if
in
context,
all
they've
tried
to
do
is
to
surround
what
went
too
far
with
a
number
of
other
things
that
would
somehow
make
it
legal.
now,
if
it
was
wrong
to
begin
with,
is
it
wrong
to
end
with?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
mean
forever?
what
i'm
thinking...
let
me
spell
it
out
a
second.
the
key
words
in
stone
would
be
that
this
was
posted,
the
ten
commandments,
because
it
would
lead
to,
in
the
circumstances,
the
students
remeditate,
venerate,
perhaps,
and
obey.
in
other
words,
their
reaction
to
it
would
likely
be
a
religious
reaction.
now,
here
if
you
saw
it
just
by
itself,
perhaps
one
would
be
concerned
with
the
intent
or
the
effect
of
calling
to
the
viewer's
mind
the
sacred
character
of
the
law,
which
is
fine
for
religious
people
to
do
but
not
necessarily
fine
for
the
state
to
do;
and
that
leads
them
to
venerate,
perhaps
to
meditate,
perhaps
to
consider
the
relationship
in
a
religious
way.
if
that's
the
problem,
that
would
exist
here
only
because
of
the
history
or
most
likely
because
of
the
history.
and
if
that
is
the
problem,
that
would
dissipate
over
time
because
it
is
the
smallness
of
the
audience
and
their
familiarity
with
the
history
that
would
likely
produce
the
similar
religious
reaction
to
the
display.
now,
what's
your
reaction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it?
it
may
be
true.
these
pilgrims
came
for
religious
reasons.
if
all
this
was...
so
you
have
a
display
of
the
history
of
the
origin
of
the
law
in
the
united
states,
what
would
be
wrong
with
saying,
this
is
a
historical
account?
it's
like
teaching
religion
in
the
schools.
of
course
it
stemmed
from
the
religious
beliefs
of
those
who
came
to
the
united
states.
you
don't
mean
it
religiously.
you
mean
it
historically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
printed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
since
you
have
a
minute,
give
me
your
opinion
to
the
right
standard
if
hypothetically
you
start
with
the
goldberg-schempp
idea,
that
the
government
is
not
absolutely
forbidden
by
the
establishment
clause
to
recognize
the
religious
nature
of
the
people
nor
the
religious
origins
of
much
of
our
law
and
so
forth
but
it's
easy
to
go
too
far
and
it's
easy
in
this
area
you
are
trading
on
eggs
to
become
far
more
divisive
than
you
hoped
and
really
end
up
with
something
worse
than
if
you
stayed
out
in
the
first
place.
in
other
words,
it's
a
very
delicate
matter
and
it's
very
easy
to
offend
people.
now,
suppose
you
start
with
that.
you're
trying
to
define
what
is
too
far
constitutionally
speaking.
what's
your
test?
of
the
many
that
have
been
in
our
opinions,
which
do
you
think
works
the
best
for
that
purpose
or
some
other?
