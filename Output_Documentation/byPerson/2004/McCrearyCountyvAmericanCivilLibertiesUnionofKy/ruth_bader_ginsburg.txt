mr.
staver,
what
about
all
the
distinctions
that
have
been
made
between
messages
that
are
brief
or
i
think
the
expression
has
been
minimal
or
minimum
in
some
of
our
cases,
like
in
god
we
trust,
like
god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court,
like
under
god,
and
a
document
that
is
about
worshipping
the
lord,
at
least
as
many
words
devoted
to
that
topic.
so
it's
not
a
brief
reference.
it's
a
powerful
statement
of
the
covenants
that
the
lord
is
making
with
his
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you
read
the
first
four
commandments
and
could
you
say
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
you
placed
heavy
reliance
on
marsh,
which
was
prayer
and
it
was
undisguised
and
it
was
permitted
as
it
has
been
since
the
beginning
of
our
nation.
would
it
be
equally
compatible
with
the
establishment
clause
if
this
court
opened
its
daily
sessions
with
prayer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
kind
of
prayer
that
is
used
to
open
the
legislative
sessions
which
this
court
has
distinguished
from
in
god
we
trust,
god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
asking
you
what
your
view
is
of
the
compatibility
of
every
federal
court
in
the
country
having
over
the
bench
a
replica
of
the
ten
commandments
and
opening
each
session
with
prayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
within
reason
outline
an
approach
that
would
say
a
religious
display
is
presumptively
for...
is
a
presumptive
endorsement.
i
think
with
the
baptist
brief.
would
you
endorse
that
test?
