justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
take
it
along
with
the
resolution
of
the
counties?
do
we
look
at
everything?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
to
consider
the
history
of
the
display
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
we
have
to
amend
the
lemon
test
to
reach
your
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think,
then,
we
have
to
either
put
it
aside
or
amend
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
decide
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
long
is
that
resolution
going
to
guide
our
view
of
the
future
displays
or
even
the
present
one?
what
if
the
membership
of
the
board
of
supervisors
is
changed?
how
long
do
we
look
to
that
particular
resolution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
in
the
record
which
we
have?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
a
resolution,
counsel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
whatever
is
in
the
record
is
that
resolution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
hasn't
been
a
new
resolution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
one
wasn't
rescinded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
adopted
and
it
still
is
there,
presumably?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
presumably
these
things
are
open
if
it
goes
on
to
the
final
hearing?
the
preliminary
injunction
stage?
