justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mitchell,
my...
my
problem
is
even
more
fundamental
than
justice
souter's.
conceding
that
the
rule
in
mississippi
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
federal
rule
in
beck,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
arguing
mississippi
law,
just
because
it
happens
to
be
the
same
as
federal
law,
amounts
to
raising
a
federal
question.
let's
assume
you
have
a...
a
state
law
against
wire-tapping.
it
is
unlawful.
and
you...
you
come
in
and
you
ask
that
the
evidence
be...
be
excluded
because
it's
contrary
to
the
state
law.
have
you
raised
a...
a
federal...
a
federal
question
when
all
you
cite
is
the
state
law,
even
though
the
effect
under
state
law
is
the
same
as
the
federal
effect
under
the
fourth
amendment?
it's
not
my
understanding
that
you've
raised
a
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
it
takes
for
the
new
york
state
supreme
court,
for
example,
to
have
said,
well,
you
know,
our...
our
wire-tap
statute
does
the
same
thing
as
the
fourth
amendment
does
anyway?
that's
all
it
takes?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
thereafter,
all
you
have
to
do
is
cite
the
new
york
state
statute,
and
you've
raised
a
federal
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
if...
but
the
state
standard
always
has
to...
has
to
comply
with
the
federal
requirement,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
it
takes
is
a...
is
a
single
decision
by
the
state
supreme
court
which
says
that
our
rule
is
no
broader
than
the
federal
constitutional
requirement,
and
thereafter
all
you
have
to
do
is
appeal
to
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
does.
why...
why
is
that...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
counsel
should
stand
up
on
his
two
feet
and
say,
we're
raising
a
federal
question.
why
is
that
too
much
of
an
imposition
when
the
statute
requires
that
you
raise
a
federal
question?
why
do
we
have
to
go
researching
what
the
state
supreme
court
said
several
years
ago?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
to
figure
out
in
every
case
whether
the
two
claims
are
interwoven.
do
you
think...
do
you
think
counsel
for
the
defense
isn't
always
going
to
say
that
they're
interwoven?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
too
much
to
ask
counsel
for
the
defense
to
say,
we
are
raising
a
federal
question.
and
it
solves
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
get
your
point.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a...
a
lesser-included
offense--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
long
as
it's
a
lesser
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
you're...
you're...
i
don't...
you're
calling
the
heat
of
passion
an
element
of...
of
the
crime
of
manslaughter?
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
walk
up
and...
and
you
blow
somebody
away.
you
can't...
there's
no
heat
of
passion.
there's
no
sudden
provocation.
you
just
walk
up
and
blow
them
away.
and
you're
telling
me
that
that's
not
a
crime
because
you
can't...
you
can't
prove
heat
of
passion?
you
can't
prove
one
of
the
other
elements
of
manslaughter?
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
enough
that
you
killed
somebody?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
killed
somebody.
you
didn't
plan
to
kill
to
somebody,
so
it's
not
murder.
okay.
but
you
killed
somebody.
surely,
there
must
be
some
crime
in...
in
mississippi
that...
that
covers
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
not
murder.
it
wasn't...
you
know,
he
didn't...
i
didn't
walk
up
to
the...
to
the
car
intending
to
kill
him.
as
you
say,
you
couldn't
have
indicted
for
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
there...
there
is
a...
you
say
there...
there
are
what?
nine
different
manslaughter,
did
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
twelve
different,
and
one
of
them
is
simply
killing
somebody
simpliciter,
without
any
provocation.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
confuse
us
by
saying
that.
if
you
just
left
that
out
of
your
statement,
felony
murder
is
killing
in
the
course
of
a
crime.
don't
say
anything
about
intent.
intent
is
not
an
element
of
felony
murder.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
want
to
get
plain
murder,
you're
adding
an
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
murder
with
intent,
and
that's
why
you
say
it's
not
a
lesser-included
offense
because
for
plain
murder,
you
need
intent,
and
for
felony
murder,
you
don't
need
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that...
isn't
that
your
case?
