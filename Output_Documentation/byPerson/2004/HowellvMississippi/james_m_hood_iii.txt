mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
make
the
point,
as
far
as
jurisdiction
goes,
that...
that
the
defendant
has
failed
to
make
a
federal
claim
and
he
is
required
under
webb
v.
webb.
if
the
mississippi
supreme
court...
if
the
lower
court
does
not
address
the
issue,
then
it
is
assumed
that
it
was
not
properly
raised.
now,
as
to
the
issue
of
beck,
there
is
no
beck
violation.
actually
mississippi
finally...
we've
gotten
in
one
instance,
we've...
we've
become
first
in...
in
this
regard.
in
jackson
v.
state
in
1976,
our
supreme
court...
which
was
cited
in
a
footnote
10,
i
believe,
in...
in
beck.
in
the
jackson
case,
mississippi
said...
we
had
the
same
statute,
pretty
much,
that
alabama
had
that
restricted
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction.
mississippi
said,
number
one,
you
cannot
restrict
that
lesser-included
offense
instruction
if
it
is
supported
by
the
facts,
and
number
two,
in
the
jackson
case,
the
court
held
that
there
had
to
be
bifurcation,
which
was
the
problem,
the
impact
on
the
guilt
phase.
and...
and
so
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
impact
in
mississippi
in
this
case
on
the
guilt
phase,
nothing
to
influence
the
jurors'
decision,
and
that
was
the
inherent
problem
that
the
court
recognized
in
beck.
number
two,
mississippi
allows
a
life
sentence,
which
also
distinguishes
beck.
it...
it
allows
the
jury,
in
a
separate,
bifurcated
hearing,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
should
receive
life
or
the
death
penalty.
and
then
thirdly,
in
mississippi,
we
have
a
broader
standard
than
the
federal
standard.
if
it's
any
lesser
offense
in
mississippi,
then
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
it
if
it's
supported
by
the
facts
of
the
case.
so
we
have
a
broader
standard
that
gives
the
defendant
an
easier
opportunity
to
meet
that
standard.
and
thirdly--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
yes,
sir--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--justice
scalia.
it
just
has
to
be
a
lesser
offense.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
we
are
analyzing
a
federal
constitutional
issue,
then
perhaps
we...
we
should
follow
federal
constitutional
standards,
which
was
stated...
the
strict
elements
test,
in
other
words,
because
under...
under
federal
law,
it
has
to
be,
well,
number
one,
a
lesser-included
offense,
a
true
lesser-included
offense,
and
under
the
schmoke
case,
this
court
has
stated
that
that
is
in
fact
applying
the
strict
elements--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
no,
sir.
i...
i'm
not
stating
that.
it
would...
it
would
be
an
offense,
but
based
upon
these
facts.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
because
the...
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
there
was
no
other
reason
for
him
to
approach
that
vehicle
than
to
rob
that
individual.
there
was
no
premeditated
intent.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir,
justice
stevens.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
it
depends
on--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--well,
that's
the
facts
that
we
had
in
this
case.
and
your
analysis
there
again
will...
will
hinge
on
whether
or
not...
in
mississippi
admittedly
murder
would
be
a
lesser-included
offense
if
the
facts
support
it
and
also
manslaughter.
but
now,
if
you
apply
the
federal
standard--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir,
it
is.
it's...
the...
the
facts
were
in
this
case,
though,
all
night
long
they
had
ridden
around
looking
for
someone
to
rob.
they
made
a
statement
in
tupelo--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--no,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
on
the
facts
that
we
had,
if...
if
you
analyze
it
under
the
federal
standard...
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
we
should
apply--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--we
don't
know...
he
didn't
know
this
defendant.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
well,
first--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--which
crime.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
you're
correct.
first,
we
wouldn't
have...
have
charged--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--based
upon
the
facts
that
we
had...
and
he
didn't
know
this
individual.
he
had
no
premeditated
intent
to
kill
him.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
it
would
not
be
murder.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
it
could
arguably
be
a
felony
murder,
which
is
a
separate
statute
in
mississippi.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
he
meant
to
commit
another--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--another
crime.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
well--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--oh,
yes,
sir.
that...
that
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
but,
of
course,
it's
premeditation.
if
there
were
evidence,
say,
for
example--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--justice
ginsburg,
to...
to...
first
of
all,
we
wouldn't
have
indicted
for
capital
murder
if
we
didn't
have
that
evidence.
we
wouldn't
be
discussing
the
beck
issue.
it
wouldn't
be
a
lesser-included
offense
question.
we'd
strictly
be
focusing
on
those
facts,
number
one,
that
particular
witness
rice
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
vehicle.
you
had
separate
testimony
from
lipsey,
the
co-defendant
who
was
in
the
vehicle
and
could...
behind
where...
where--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--it
would
be
manslaughter,
i
suppose,
your
honor.
that's
not
the
facts
in
this
case
and...
and
i
apologize--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--there--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--there
are
12
separate
manslaughter
sections
in
the
mississippi
code,
not
in
one
section.
our
murder
section
lists...
lists
four
just
in
one
section.
there
are
12
different
ones.
we
have
one
if
you
drive
a
nail
in
a
tree
and...
and
you're...
you're
cutting
lumber
and
it
kills
someone,
that's
a
manslaughter
still.
this
defendant
only
requests
a
culpable
manslaughter
instruction.
there
was
no
evidence
to...
to
support
that.
the
only
potentially...
i...
i
could
even
make
a
stretch...
would
be
heat
of
passion.
he
did
not
request
that...
request
the
instruction,
and--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--his
failure
to
request--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--perhaps
the
judge
should
correct
within
a
particular
statute,
but
not
go
look
at
all
12
statutes
that
he's
under...
which...
which
would
classify
as
murder.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
would
have
had
to...
to
have
specifically
requested
heat
of
passion.
but
there
again,
i
don't
believe
that
he
put
on
evidence
to
support
even--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--i
don't...
that's
only
a
stretch
to
answer...
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
it...
it
would
have
to
be
classified
as--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--i...
i
believe
what
he
was
addressing
was
language
within
a
particular
statute,
meaning
a
lesser-included
offense
of...
of
murder
or
how
you
styled
it,
whether
it
be
depraved
heart
murder
or...
or
felony
murder,
first
degree
murder.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
and...
and
there
again,
i'd
like
for
the
court
to...
to
understand
my
statement
that
we
should
construe
this
on
what...
how
the
federal
law...
how
you...
how
the
federal
courts
construe
it,
not
use
mississippi's
lesser
standard,
but
let's...
let's
construe
it
on
whether
or
not,
first,
it
is
a
true
lesser-included
offense
because
that's...
that's
what
the
federal
standard
is,
and
that's
what
we
followed
in
nebraska.
and
secondly,
if
it's
a
true
lesser-included
offense,
we
have
to
use
the
analysis
of
the
federal
courts
which
says
that
it
has
to
use
the
strict
elements
test.
well,
murder
would
not
be
a
lesser-included
offense
under
federal
law
because
under
the
mississippi
capital
murder
statute
can
be
with
or
without
deliberate
design.
therefore,
there
is
no
deliberate
design.
it
would
not
be
a
lesser-included
offense
of
murder.
manslaughter
would
not
be
a
lesser-included
offense
under
that
same
elements
test
because
it
requires
the
additional
element
of
sudden
provocation
or
heat
of
passion.
so
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
if
we
apply
what's
fair
under
federal
law,
what
the
floor
is
under
federal
law,
we
should
use
the
federal
analysis
and
not
mississippi--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--it
would
be
a
matter
of
the
defense
raising
sudden
provocation.
and
i
don't
believe
that
they...
they
certainly
didn't
put
on
anything
about
culpable
negligence.
for
example,
maybe
he
was
spinning
the
gun
in
his
hand
for
culpable
negligence.
they
didn't
put
on
anything
about
deliberate
design
because
he
didn't
want
to
testify.
his
defense
was
alibi
and
so
he
didn't
take
the
stand
and
say,
i
intended
to
kill
this
person,
therefore,
give
me
the
murder
instruction.
he's
got
to
put
on
evidence
to
support
it,
and
i
don't
believe
he
put
on
sufficient
evidence
for
either
of
those.
and...
and
i
was
the
district
attorney
who
tried
this
case,
so
factually
i...
i
remember
the...
the...
my
argument
was
that
we
couldn't
have
proved
murder
if
we
had
wanted
to
because
there
was
no
premeditation.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
he
could
have
asked
for
a
heat
of
passion
instruction,
but--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--but
he
did
not
do
so.
yes,
sir.
that...
those
facts--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--it's
sudden
provocation,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
no,
sir.
the--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--if...
if--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir.
you--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--charge
murder
and...
and
the
prosecution--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--likely,
the
state
would...
would
have...
have...
if
those
were
the
facts
and
that's
all
the
facts
that
we
had,
then
the
state
would
likely
have
charged
murder
and
asked
for
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction
for
manslaughter.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
twelve
different
manslaughter--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir,
without.
but
he
requested
the
culpable
negligent
manslaughter
instruction,
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
culpable
negligent
manslaughter.
it's
a
separate
section
in
our
code
now.
there
are
12
different
sections.
it's
not
like
we
have
one
statute
that
lists
all
of
those.
and...
and
some
of
them
are...
are
arcane.
and
i
think
it's
unfair
to
ask
a
trial
court
judge
to
correct
every
request
for
an
instruction
and...
and...
he...
at
trial,
if
you
read--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--there
are
two
possibilities
that
were
not
requested.
one
is
our
felony...
felony
murder.
felony
murder
is...
is
the
killing
of...
that
occurs
without
occurring
with
one
of
the
seven
offenses
that
we
have
listed,
murder,
rape,
and
so
forth,
committing
another
crime.
or
heat
of
passion
manslaughter.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that...
that
they
never
requested
anything
about
the
felony
murder
and
they
never
requested
the
heat
of
passion
manslaughter.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
elements
of
the
offense
are
that
he...
that
he...
a
killing
occurred
with
or
without
intent
and
that
it
was
in
the
commission
of...
of
a
crime,
robbery.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
with
or
without
under
mississippi
law--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
it...
if
you...
if
you
prove
the
intent--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir.
if
you
just
take
those
away
and
you
just
have
those
two
elements,
with
or
without,
if
it's
with
intent,
then
it
would
be
classified
as
murder.
if
it's
without,
it
could
possibly
be...
without
intent,
then
it
could
be
classified
as
manslaughter.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
i...
i--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir,
i
understand.
but
there
again,
if
we
go
back
to
what
the
federal
standards
are,
we're
talking
about
what
the
united
states
constitution
requires,
and
therefore,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
we
should
apply
what
the
federal
law
is.
and
that
law
is...
number
one,
is
it
a
lesser-included
offense?
using
the
elements
test,
murder
is
not
a
lesser-included
offense
to
capital
murder,
and
the
reason
being
is
because
capital
murder
is
with
or
without
intent
and
you
add
an
additional
element
of
murder
which
requires
intent.
same
goes
for
manslaughter
because
you
had
the
additional
sudden
provocation
element.
so
i
would
say
that
if
we
follow
the
federal
standard
and...
and
that's...
that's
the
floor,
and
the
floor
is
it's
got
to
be
a
lesser-included
offense,
it...
it's
not
a...
a
lesser-included
offense.
so
therefore
that
should
answer
the
question.
secondly,
under
the
federal
standard,
you
have
to
prove
that...
that
the
court...
the
judge
has
to
decide
that
the...
a
reasonable
juror
would
acquit
of
the
greater
offense
and
also
convict
of
the
lesser.
well,
mississippi
law
does
not
require
that,
but
i...
i'd
submit
to
the
court
that...
that
after
the
beck
decision
in
1980,
our
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
in
re
jordan...
they
applied
the
federal
standard.
they
required
that...
when
they
analyzed
beck,
they
applied
the
federal
standard,
in
other
words,
the...
the
part
about
that
you
have
to
acquit.
you
have
to
acquit
on...
on
the
greater
offense.
and
they
also
included
the
lesser-included
offense
language
in
that
beck
analysis.
so,
therefore,
had
he
properly
raised
the
jurisdictional
issue...
there's
nowhere
in
the
record
does
he
cite
beck.
there's
nowhere
in
the
record
that
he
states
facts
that
would
even
support
beck.
so
had
he
even
properly
reached
that
issue
and...
and
cited
beck,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
facts
don't
support
it
under
mississippi
law.
the
facts
don't
support
it
under
federal
law.
and
it
doesn't
meet
the
lesser-included
offense
standard.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
there
again,
your
honor--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--no,
sir.
and...
and
i
would
say
that
under
the
federal
standard,
clearly
it's
not
a
lesser-included
offense.
i
would
say
under
the
state--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--no,
sir.
he
didn't...
first
of
all,
he
never--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
i...
i
didn't
follow
you.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
right.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
right.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir,
on
a
felony--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir,
and
that's
why
i
would
submit
to
the
court
it
distinguishes--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
i'd
like
to
also
point
out
factually
that
in
the...
in
the...
initially
in
the
petition,
the...
and
actually
at
trial
and
at
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
they
talked
about
that
the
defendant
may
have
been
able...
may
have
been
out
there
selling
drugs
to
the
defendant.
i'd
submit
to
the
court
that
a
proper
view
of
the
record,
if
you
look
at
the
mississippi
supreme
court
opinion
at
page
98
and...
97
and
98
and
page
40,
the
defendant
in
his
own
brief
admits
that
that
was
not
in
evidence.
it
came
from
the...
from
a
plea
where
the...
where
one
of
the
co-defendants
pled,
and
it
never
was
placed
before
the
jury.
here
in...
in
the
brief
in
this
particular
case,
they
talk
about,
well,
he...
maybe
he
was
borrowing
money,
the
sting
question,
whether
he
was
borrowing
money.
that
comment
came
from
one
of
the
witnesses
named
powell
who
was
merely
speculating.
i
don't
know
what
he
was
talking
about
a
sting,
but
it
could
have
been
that
he
was
going
to
borrow
money
or...
or
rob
somebody.
so
that...
that
was
speculation.
so
the...
the
facts
just
don't
support
the
granting
of
a
lesser-included
offense
in
this
particular
case.
i'd
also
like
to
ask
the
court
to...
to
note
that
in
hopkins
v.
reeves
in
footnote
7,
the...
the
court
suggests
that
we
don't
decide
that...
that
particular
case
based
upon
the
bifurcation
issue
alone.
i
would
ask
that
the
court
answer
that
question
in
this
particular
case
and
state
that
beck
has
no
application
in
this
particular
case
because
the
danger
that
occurred
and
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
beck
is
not...
doesn't
happen
here
in
the
mississippi
instance
because
in
jackson
v.
state,
we
had
already
said
that
you
have
a
bifurcated
hearing--
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
--justice
stevens,
i...
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
we
believe
that
the...
the
beck
issue
is
just
with
this
question.
you
have
a
choice
of
guilt
and
death
penalty
or
acquittal.
this
question
that
they're
raising
is
conviction,
not
death
penalty,
or
acquittal.
and
those
are
separate
issues.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
yes,
sir,
but
it
doesn't
impact
the
guilt
phase,
and
that
was
what
the
problem
was,
i
believe,
in
beck,
was
that...
that
a
jury
might
not...
they
don't
want
to
turn
him
loose
because...
and
they
give
him
a
conviction,
which
automatically
carries
the
death
penalty.
and
that
impacts
the
jury.
and
i
understand
that.
that
was
a
proper
decision,
but
that
just
didn't
happen
here
in
this
particular
case.
and
mississippi
has
just
distinguished
beck.
i
don't
believe
that
they
properly
raise
this
court's
jurisdiction.
they
never
cite
beck.
they
never
raised...
they
never
said
due
process.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
well,
maybe
i
don't
understand
the
question
correctly.
but
in
beck,
you
know,
the
jury
wasn't
told
that
the
judge
would
have
a
separate
option
of
denying
the
death
penalty.
in
this
case,
judge
in
state's...
court
instruction
c-5,
the
court
says
you
are
not
to
consider
the
sentence,
that
you
only
consider
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
charge.
and
so
that's
why
i
say
this
is
not
a
beck
issue
because
it
doesn't
impact
the...
the
jury's
determination
in
the
guilt
phase.
mr.
james
m.
hood,
iii
well,
justice
kennedy,
in
mississippi,
we
have,
there
again,
that
open
standard,
not
the
federal
standard.
and
we
would
give
him
that
instruction
and
give
that
jury
that
option
if
the
facts
support
it,
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that...
that
the
facts
do
not
support
a
lesser-included
offense
under
these
facts.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
