well,
it
isn't
even
clear
here
that
beck
would
have
been
violated.
as
i
understand
it,
in...
in
mississippi
the
jury
could
have
given
a
sentence
less
than
death
despite
the
conviction.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
so
i'm
not
sure
if
beck
even
applies
on
its
own
terms.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
finally,
i
have
a
per
curiam
opinion
to
announce
in
no.03-9560,
howell
versus
mississippi.
marlon
howell,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
convicted
of
capital
murder.
he
argues
that
the
mississippi
courts
violated
his
federal
constitutional
rights
by
refusing
to
require
a
jury
instruction
for
manslaughter
or
simple
murder.
when
we
granted
certiorari,
we
asked
the
parties
to
address
whether
this
federal
constitutional
claim
was
properly
raised
before
the
mississippi
supreme
court
for
purposes
of
section
28
u.s.
code
1257.
that
statute
gives
this
court
the
power
to
review
state
court
judgments
when
federal
rights
are
specially
set
up
or
claimed.
under
that
statute,
this
court
has
almost
unfailingly
refused
to
consider
any
federal
law
challenge
to
a
state
court
decision
unless
the
federal
claim
was
either
addressed
by
or
properly
presented
to
the
state
court.
we
hold
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
state
supreme
court
did
not
properly
present
his
claim
as
one
arising
under
federal
law.
in
the
relevant
argument,
he
did
not
cite
the
u.s.
constitution
or
even
any
cases
directly
construing
it,
much
less
any
of
this
court’s
cases.
instead,
he
argues
that
he
presented
his
federal
claim
by
citing
one
case
which
cited
another
case,
which
in
turn
cited
the
case
from
this
court
that
established
the
constitutional
right
he
now
asserts.
this
daisy
chain
is
too
lengthy
to
meet
this
court’s
standards
for
proper
presentation
of
a
federal
claim.
as
we
recently
explained
in
a
slightly
different
context,
a
litigant
wishing
to
raise
a
federal
issue
can
easily
indicate
the
federal
law
basis
for
the
claim
by
citing
in
conjunction
with
the
claim
the
federal
source
of
law
on
which
he
relies
or
a
case
deciding
such
a
claim
on
federal
grounds
or
by
simply
labeling
the
claim
federal.
in
the
context
of
section
1257,
the
same
steps
toward
clarity
are
just
as
easy
to
take
and
are
generally
necessary
to
establish
that
a
federal
question
was
properly
presented
to
a
state
court.
petitioner
took
none
of
these
steps.
petitioner
also
contends
he
raised
his
federal
claim
by
implication
because
the
state
law
rule
on
which
he
relied
was
identical
or
virtually
identical
to
the
constitutional
claim
we
have
articulated.
but
mississippi’s
rule
about
jury
instructions
differs
from
our
constitutional
rule
in
several
ways.
petitioner
finally
suggests
that
we
still
have
discretion
to
consider
his
federal
claim
because
the
presentation
requirement
is
not
jurisdictional.
as
in
prior
cases
however,
we
need
not
decide
today
whether
our
requirement
that
a
federal
claim
be
properly
presented
in
a
state
court
is
jurisdictional
or
prudential,
because
even
treating
the
rule
as
purely
prudential,
the
circumstances
here
justify
no
exception.
accordingly,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
