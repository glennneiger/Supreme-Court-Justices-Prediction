justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
howell
against
mississippi.
mr.
mitchell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
mitchell?
supposing
the...
there
are
alternative
lesser-included
offenses
that
might
be
urged
by
the
defendant
as
to...
to
get
an
instruction
on,
and
he
asks
for
the
wrong
one.
in
other
words,
the
question...
there
is
a
question
here
about
exactly
what
is
the
lesser-included
offense.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
he
tried
to
kill...
if
he
killed
the
driver
of
the
vehicle,
there
may
well
have
been
some
kind
of
crime.
but
maybe
you
ask
for
a
lesser-included
offense
of,
say,
simple
murder
and
the
facts
don't
fit
simple
murder,
but
they
might
fit
manslaughter
or
something
else.
would
your
request
for...
for
a
simple
murder,
lesser-included
offense
instruction
be
sufficient
if
you
should
really
have
asked
for
a
different
lesser-included
offense
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may.
general
hood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question
there,
general
cox?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
if
the
man
approached
the
victim
in
the
car
and
shot
him
and
killed
him,
as
i
understand
it,
and
the
theory
was
an
attempted
robbery
and
therefore
the...
the
capital
offense.
now,
are
you
telling
me
that
if
they
failed
to
prove
there
was
an
attempted
robbery,
it
was
not
an
offense
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
wasn't
he
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
whatever
offense
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
his
theory
was
if
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
on
the
attempted
robbery,
that
all
was
left
was
a...
a
killing
for
some
other
reason.
and
if
there
was
a
killing...
if
there
was
a
failure
of
proof
on
attempted
robbery,
would
he
not
then
have
been
entitled
to
a...
a
lesser
offense
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
your
theory
is
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
the
proof
that
there
was
an
attempted
robbery
is
so
convincing
that
no
other
theory
was
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
scott,
i
suggest
you
try
to
answer
her
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
that's...
one
witness
is
all
you
had.
would
there
be
a
crime
against
the
law
of
mississippi
and
if
so,
what
would
it
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
under
your
view
of
the
facts,
as
i
understand
it,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
manslaughter
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
surely...
surely,
if
one
walks
up
to
a
car
and
shoots
the
driver
dead,
that's
must
be
a
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is
we
don't
know
exactly
which
of
your
several
statutory
provisions
it
violated,
but
if
it
violated
one
of
them,
i
don't
understand.
and
if
he's
correct...
maybe
he
misrepresents
the
law.
he
tells
us,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
if
he
asked
for
the
wrong
lesser-included
instruction,
but
there
is
a
correct
one,
the
judge
has
a
duty
to
give
the
correct
instruction.
that's
what...
what
the
counsel
has
told
us.
and
if
that's
right,
i
don't
understand
why
he
wasn't
entitled
to
some
lesser-included
offense
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's...
it's
your
view
he
must
ask
for
the
correct
lesser-included
offense
instruction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
sudden
provocation
or
heat
of
passion
part
of
the
prosecution's
burden
or
a
part
of
his...
one
of
the...
is
it
a
matter
of
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
just
to
help
me
sort
of...
what
are
the...
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
what
are
the
elements
of
the
offense
for
which
he
was
convicted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
the
two
elements.
and
so
that
if
you
take
out
with...
in
the
commission
of
another
crime
and
just
left
the...
the
other
part
of
it,
would
that
also
be
an
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
say...
you
say
the
offenses
are
killing
somebody
with
or
without
the
intent
to
do
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
in
the
course
of
an
attempted
felony.
say
you
failed
to
prove
the
attempted
felony
and
you
proved
the
remainder
of
the...
the
other
elements.
is
he
guilty
of
anything
in...
under
mississippi--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
if
he
is,
why
isn't
it
a
lesser-included
offense
is
my
next
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
then
there
are
two
lesser-included
offenses,
and
either
one
would
have...
he
should
have
gotten
an
instruction
on
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
understand
why
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but...
but
it
is
true
that...
that
there's
a
difference
between
becoming
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
on
the
one
hand,
and
not
being
eligible
on
the
other.
and
conceivably
the
beck
concern
is
triggered
when
the
failure
to
give
a
lesser-included
offense
gives
the
jury
the
option
of...
no
other
option
other
than
convicting
of
a
capital
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--an
offense
for
which
the
death
penalty
is
the
punishment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
the
jurors'
concern
is
that
you
either
have
to
acquit
them
or...
we
want
to
make
sure
he
never
walks
out
of
prison
again,
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
convict
him
of
a
capital
offense
so
the
judge
can
impose
the
death
penalty.
i
don't
know
why
that
beck
wouldn't
be
triggered
on
those
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
general
hood.
mr.
mitchell,
you
have
about
4
and
a
half
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
mitchell.
the
case
is
submitted.
