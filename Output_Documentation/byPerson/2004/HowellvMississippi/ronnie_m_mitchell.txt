mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
has
directed
us
to
address,
in
addition
to
the
question
raised
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
following
question.
was
petitioner's
federal
constitutional
claim
properly
raised
before
the
mississippi
supreme
court
for
purposes
of
28
united
states
code,
section
1257?
accordingly,
we
begin
by
addressing
that
question
and
answering
it
affirmatively.
here,
howell
maintains,
one,
the
standards
for
adjudicating
state
and
federal
claims
of
this
particular
type
are
identical--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--where
they're
labeled
as
such--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
that
the
rule
in
beck
establishes
that
state
law
must
be
viewed
and
state
law
is
the
determiner
of
whether
an
offense
is
a
lesser-included
offense,
but
federal
law,
the
federal
constitution
determines
whether,
as
a
matter
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
eighth
amendment
concerns,
whether
an
instruction
must
be
given
as
a
federal
constitutional
matter.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
respectfully,
justice
souter,
we
would
submit
that
mississippi's
own
law
says
that
it
embraces
the
beck
standard
and
that
mississippi's
own
law--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--we
would
respectfully
submit
that...
that
in
mississippi,
for
example,
as
contrasted
with
the
statutory
scheme
that
was
present
in
hopkins,
the
nebraska
scheme,
in
the
mississippi
scheme,
mississippi
has
held
that
simple
murder
is
a
lesser-included
offense,
and
therefore,
by
definition
that
offense
at
least
mirrors
what
is
required
under
beck.
now,
the
question
of
whether
some
other
lesser--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--in--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--well,
we
believe
that...
that
it
is
the
same.
and
in
fact,
the...
the
case
that
the
state
cites,
state
v.
goodin,
explains
that.
the
representation
of
goodin
in
the
state's
brief,
as
it
appears
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
23,
we
contend
is
not
faithfully
representative
of
what
the
court
said
in
that
case.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
goodin
is
the
case
that
the
state
cited
for
that
purpose,
but
an
analysis
of
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
actually
said
at
page
656
of
the
southern
reporter,
787,
is
this.
the
goodin
jury
did
not
face
the
dilemma
of
the
beck
jury.
here,
the
jury's
alternatives
in
the
guilt
phase
were
to
convict
goodin
of
capital
murder,
simple
murder,
or
to
acquit
him,
which
is
the
very
purpose
that
the
later
cases...
and
beck
itself
explains.
schad,
for
example,
explains
that
the
reason
for
the
beck
determination
was
that
presenting
only
the
option
of
convicting
of
a
capital
offense
or
acquitting
was
not
constitutionally
permissible.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
incorrect.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
what
i
do
believe
is
correct
is
that
under
mississippi
law,
the
jury,
because
of
the
bifurcated
nature
of
the...
of
the
case,
is
given
at
least
the
preliminary
reference
or
preliminary
instruction
that
if
there
is
a
guilt
verdict,
then
there
will
be
a
sentencing
phase.
but
we
submit
that
that
is
a
distinction
that
this
court
has
not
adopted,
nor
have
other
courts
adopted
because
in
this
situation--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--your
honor,
we
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
position
because
of
the
analysis
that
the
court
has
undertaken,
for
example,
in
hopkins
and
because
of
the
analysis
in
spaziano
v.
florida.
in
those
cases,
they
were
presented
with
schemes
in
which
the
jury
did
not,
of
necessity,
impose
the
death
penalty.
however,
the
jury
was
confronted
with
exactly
the
same
position--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--well,
the
consequence
of
the
jury
verdict
may
have
been
the
death
penalty.
for
example,
in
spaziano,
the...
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty.
the
jury
recommended
life,
but
the
judge
imposed
a
sentence
of
death
nevertheless.
in
the
hopkins
case,
the...
a
three-judge
panel
then
imposed
the
death
penalty.
those...
those
differences
in
sentencing
schemes
we
do
not
believe
separates
the
rationale
of
beck
which
is
the
danger
of
affecting
the
jury
verdict
by
being
faced
with
the
dilemma
of
either
convicting
of
a
capital
offense
or
acquitting.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
i
do
not
believe
that
i
would
have
unless
in
that
particular
state,
if
its
highest
court
had
said,
we
embrace
the
same
standard
and
we
apply
the
same--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--i
believe--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--no,
respectfully,
your
honor.
however,
if
the
state
supreme
court
has
adopted
not
only
the
same
purpose,
but
the
very
language
and
has,
in
effect,
said,
our
ruling
in
these
cases
is
controlled
by
the
same
provision
of
law,
whether
a...
a
decision
of
this
court,
as
in
the
beck
standard
that
we
believe
mississippi
has
adopted,
or
if
the
court
has
articulated
that
the
united
states
constitution
controls
this
particular
provision.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
it
always
has
to
comply
with
the...
with
the
federal
requirement,
but
as
justice
souter
pointed
out,
it
may
be
broader,
for
example,
in
situations
where
there
might
be
a
right
to
a...
a
jury
instruction
on
a
lesser-related
offense.
for--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--well,
while
we
believe
that
is
minimally
sufficient,
we
believe
that
thereafter
it
is
important
certainly
to
raise
a
claim
which
puts
the
court
on
notice
of
a--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--claim.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
where...
where
it
is
generally
understood,
as
in
this
case,
that
the
two
claims
are
interwoven,
we
believe
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
as
the
court
has
said,
is
plain.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
i
think
counsel
for
the
defense
would,
indeed,
contend
that
they
were
interwoven.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
the...
the
difficulty
in
saying
that
we...
that
we
raise
a
federal
question
is
that
suppose,
in
this
instance,
the
trial
counsel
and
appellate
counsel,
mr.
lott,
had
said,
the
jury
in
this
case
is
presented
with
an
untenable
position,
convicting
of
a
capital
offense
or
acquitting.
that's
untenable
and
that
raises
a
federal
question.
would
the
state
then
concede
that
that
was
a
sufficient
assertion
of
a
federal
constitutional
claim?
probably
not,
and
that
is
because
the
state
contends,
just
as
the
amicus
brief
contends,
that
this
court
should
adopt
some
inflexible
rule
that
is
extremely
and
extraordinarily
difficult
to
apply
in
the
context
of,
for
example,
a
trial
in
mississippi
or
north
carolina
where
counsel
understands
the
lifeblood
of
the
rule,
the
lifeblood
even
of
the
constitution,
but
cannot
at
the
moment
recall
the
correct
citation.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
and...
and
we
would
concede
that
but
for
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
instance,
this
particular
rule
is
so
clearly
identifiable.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
well,
your
honor,
we
would
respectfully
submit
suppose
that
the...
that
howell's
counsel
here
had
called
this
a
schad
issue,
for
example,
where
a
sentencing
scheme
somewhat
similar
to
the
present--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--and...
and--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--or...
or
suppose--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--or...
or--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--but
justice
souter--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--suppose,
though,
that
this
were
not...
were
not
a...
a
lesser-included
instruction
case.
suppose
that
what
had
happened
in
this
case
was
that
howell
had
stood
before
the
judge
and
said,
i'm
asking
for
you
to
appoint
counsel,
and
the
judge
said,
well,
under
the
law
of
this
state,
i
don't
have
to
do
that.
but
then
howell
had
responded,
but
the
supreme
court
says
that
you
do.
would
that
then
be
sufficient
to
raise--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--well--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--maybe
he
meant
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
no,
but
we
would
say...
we
would
say
this,
your
honor,
that
the
effort
to
federalize
the
claim
as
was
done
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court
was
done
in
an
effort
to
address
the
instructions
as
a
whole,
and--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--we
would
concede
that.
once
the
sentencing
phase
was
reached.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
it
would
be
our
contention,
your
honor,
that...
that
spaziano
v.
florida,
that
schad,
and
the
cases
following
beck,
hopkins
v.
nebraska
even
would,
of
necessity...
or
hopkins
v.
reeves...
i'm
sorry...
the
nebraska
scheme...
would,
of
necessity,
report
to
the
court
the
continuing
vitality
of
beck
even
under
these
circumstances,
but
it...
it
is
a
matter
that
we
believe
was
at
least
made
fairly
and
reasonably
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that...
that
the
state's
recitation
of
goodin
is
not
a
faithful
representation
of
what
happened
in
goodin.
in
goodin,
he
was...
the
defendant
was
given
the
lesser-included
simple
murder
instruction,
which
howell
seeks.
it
was
a
robbery
case.
the
report
of
the
case
appears
at
787
so.2d,
beginning,
i
believe
it's,
639.
at
pages
655
and
656,
the
court
addresses
the
beck
issue,
and
it
says
there
that
because
the
jury's
alternative
in
the
guilt
phase
was
either
to
convict
of
capital
murder
or
simple
murder
or
to
acquit,
then
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
beck...
that
beck
was
not
violated.
it
then
says
we
must
look
to
our
practice
to
determine
whether
a
manslaughter
instruction
should
be
given.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
respectfully
submit
that
goodin
does
not
attempt
to
distinguish
beck,
but
in
fact
squarely
addresses
a
beck
claim,
although...
and
we
candidly
admit...
goodin's
counsel
did
cite
beck
itself
to
the
mississippi
court.
nevertheless,
the
claim
was
phrased
in
precisely
the
same
manner
in
which
mr.
howell's
counsel
expressed
the
same
claim.
these
claims,
therefore,
we
would
respectfully
contend,
are
not
virtually
identical
but
are
in
fact
identical.
but
even
if
there
were
some
minor
variations,
some
deviations,
as
this
court
indicated
would
appear
from
time
to
time,
we
contend
that
clearly
that
such
identity,
such
virtual
identity
is
sufficient
to
raise
the
issue.
in
this
case,
howell's
trial
and
appellate
counsel
raised
two
issues
with
regard
to
the
jury
instructions.
those
two
issues
themselves
were
interrelated.
those
two
issues
were
a
whole.
those
issues
related
to
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
of
robbery
and
whether
or
not...
or
attempted
robbery
rather,
and
whether
or
not
there
was
a
basis
to
give
a
lesser-included
instruction.
the
cases
which
he
cites
are
state
cases
related
to
the
necessity
of
giving
lesser-included
instructions
where
there's
an
attempted
robbery
and
simple
murder
is,
therefore,
included
in
that
offense.
he
also,
at
the
outset
of
his
contentions
with
regard
to
jury
instructions,
says
that
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
these
jury
instructions...
and
we
contend
that
they
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
these
jury
instructions
violate
his
rights
under
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
sufficient...
while
not
a
cognate
of
that,
is
sufficient
to
at
least
be
a
corresponding
claim,
a
substantially
identical
claim
to
beck,
and
one
which
entitles
the
defendant
as
a
matter
of
due
process
and
as
a
matter
of
eighth
amendment
consideration
and
concern,
to
an
instruction.
the
difficulty
that
we
face
in
a
circumstance
such
as
this
where
the
instruction
is
not
given
is
that
the
jury's
function,
while
not
always
reviewable,
but
which
is
always
entitled
to
protection,
may
be
called
into
question
and
the
quality
of
the
verdict
impeached,
in
effect,
by
the
failure
to
have
the
third
option.
in
essence,
it
is
our
contention
that
where
a
defendant
uses
the
very
words
that
this
court
has
used
to
describe
the
constitutional
claim,
where
it
uses
the
very
words
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
used--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--we
would
respectfully
submit
that...
that
even
the
mississippi
court
has
addressed
that
situation
in...
in
a
case
cited
in...
in
the
briefs
in
mease.
and
there,
the
defendant
asked
five
times
for
instructions,
lesser-included
offense
instructions,
and
never
actually
got
them
right.
the
court
said
that
that
is
not
a
basis
upon
which
to
deny
the
instruction
and
then,
citing
back,
said
that
where
there
is
a
proper
lesser-included
offense,
the
fact
that
the...
that
the
defendant
does
not
request
the
proper
instruction
still
rises
to
the
constitutional
proportions
that
a
beck
claim
does.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
we...
we
believe
that
it
does
raise
it
adequately.
we
believe
that
it--
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
--we
do
contend
that
it
was
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
we
believe
that...
that
there
are,
in
effect,
two
forms
of
simple
murder
because
of
the
structure
of...
and
in
fact,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said
this...
because
of
the
structure
of
the
mississippi
murder
definitions.
they
are
contained
in
a
number
of
separate
sections,
but
the
most
important
of
which
is
that
a
killing,
not
done
in
certain
enumerated
felonies,
such
as
robbery
or
attempt
to
rob,
would
constitute
simple
murder.
we
believe
that
the
simple
murder
instruction
would
have
been
correct.
but
even
if
it
were
not,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
sufficient
to
raise
the
question.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
arguably
it
would
be
manslaughter.
for
example,
the
mease
case,
which
the
state
cites
and
to
which
i
made
reference,
was
a
case
in
which
capital
murder
was
not
robbery
murder
as
in
this
case,
but
the
killing
of
a
police
officer.
in
mease,
there
was
an
altercation
between
the
sheriff
and
mease.
during
that
altercation,
mease
was
struck
on
the
head
by
another
deputy.
his
contention
was
that
the
gun
fired,
which
he
was
holding
next
to
the
sheriff's
neck.
the
gun
fired
by
reaction
for
two
reasons,
one
that
he
was
in
a
fight
and,
secondly,
that
he
was
struck.
the
mease
court
said
that
that
was
a
proper
basis
to
instruct
on
manslaughter,
the
fact
that
he
had
pulled
the
gun
and
was
using
it
during
the
course
of
the
fight.
now,
while
i
find
that
case
difficult
to
parse,
we
believe
that
that
certainly
could
have
been
an
argument
that
could
have
been
raised
and
that,
albeit
it
was
not,
it
could
have
been
a
proper
instruction
to
have
been
given.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
justice
stevens,
and...
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
regard
to
the
argument
that
the
state
makes
here
that
these
individuals
had
ridden
around
all
night
with
a
plan
to
rob
and
that,
therefore,
there
were
no
other...
there
was
no
other
possibility
for
the
court
to
consider
in...
in
granting
instructions,
first,
it
is
our
contention
that
both
mississippi
law
and
due
process
law
requires
a
judge
to
instruct
a
jury
on
all
of
the
relevant
issues
in
the
case,
on
all
the
relevant
law
in
the
case.
and
in
fairchild
v.
state,
that
is
precisely
what
the
mississippi
court
did
in
saying
that
a
court
could
not
simply
conclude,
no
matter
how
strong
the
evidence
of
attempt
to
rob
or
plan
to
rob,
that
it
could,
in
effect,
direct
a
verdict
and
not
instruct
on
lesser-included
offenses.
mr.
ronnie
m.
mitchell
your
honor,
those
are
the
ones
that
were...
were,
in
fact,
raised.
we
believe
that
rather
than
intent
the...
on
the
simple
murder,
that
the
issue
is
malice
as
opposed
to
intent.
the
statutory
definition,
for
example,
of
manslaughter
in...
in
mississippi
statute
97-3...
i
believe
27
is
a
killing
of
a
human
being
without
malice
and
while
not
in
the
commission
of
these
felonies.
now,
it
may
be
that
simply
a
small-town
lawyer
from...
from
north
carolina
is
told
don't
go
to
the
big
city
and
get
stung
by
some
guy
coming
up
to
you
and
saying,
you
know,
i
just
got
off
the
bus
and
i
need
to
get
some
money
from
you
and
my
kids
and
my
wife
are
waiting
for
me
in
the
hotel
room.
but
that
happens
not
only
in
the
big
city,
it
also
happens
in
mississippi.
and
so
there
was
a
basis
in
which
a
jury
could
reasonably
infer
that
there
was
a
reason
to
approach
that
vehicle
other
than
an
attempted
robbery.
and
the
question
is,
what
is
a
reasonable
inference?
the
mississippi
court
here
in
its
opinion
said
that
there
was
clearly
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
infer
robbery.
we
concede
that,
but
there
were
also
other
inferences
that
this
evidence
raised,
and
that
evidence,
we
respectfully
submit,
mandated
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction.
we
also
contend
that...
that
the
state
has
not,
heretofore,
raised
any
issue
about
beck's
continuing
vitality,
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
beck
is
of
continuing
vitality.
just
a...
a
survey
of
even
habeas
corpus
cases
from
the
various
circuits
will
show
that
the
circuits
are
continuing
to
apply
beck
even
in
states
where
the
statutory
sentencing
scheme
is
far
different
from
beck
and
there
is
no
preclusive
statute
involved,
as
there
was
in
alabama.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
language
in
beck
itself
speaks
to
this
issue.
the
beck
court
added,
the
same
reasoning
must
apply
to
rules
that
diminish
the
reliability
of
the...
the
guilt
determination,
the
very
point
that
justice
kennedy
pointed
out
undercuts
mississippi's
argument.
it
is
this
diminution
of
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
determination
that
is
at
issue
here.
in
addition
to
that,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
under
these
circumstances,
there
was
a
basis
under
which
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction
was
mandated
because
beck
did
not
apply
the
blockburger
test.
in
fact,
it
did
not
incorporate
blockburger,
did
not
refer
to
mullaney
v.
wilbur.
what
it
did
was
it
said
if
there
is
a
lesser-included
offense,
as
defined
by
state
law.
all
of
the
succeeding
cases
from
this
court
have
said
if
there
is
a
lesser-included
offense,
as
defined
by
state
law,
conceding
that
state
law
is
the
applicable
standard
then
and
not
the
standard
that
the
state
now
seeks
to
impose,
which
it
never
raised
in...
in
its
brief,
which
it
has
never
asserted
to
be
the
standard.
blockburger
is
certainly
not
cited
in
anything
that
the
state
has
submitted.
blockburger
is
not
contended
to
be
the
basis,
nor
could
it
be.
the
basis
is
is
there
a
lesser-included
offense
under
state
law,
and
we
contend
that
that
is
the
basis
on
which
this
case
should
be
decided.
thank
you
very
much.
