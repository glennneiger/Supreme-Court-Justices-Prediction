justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
the
standards
under
beck
are
different
from
the
standards
under
the
roughly
comparable
state
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
because
under
the
state
rule,
the
lesser
offense
need
not
be
an
included
offense,
in
the
technical
sense;
and
number
two,
there
need
not
be,
in
the
absence
of
a
further
instruction,
a...
a
limitation
to
the
jury
to
two
choices,
death
or
acquittal,
so
that
unless
one
is
very
careful
to
raise
the
federal
standard,
simply
raising
the
state
standard
wouldn't
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
it
embraces
it
because
it's
broader,
which
means
that
if
you
raise...
if
you...
if
you
make
a
claim
under
the
state
standard,
you
are
not
necessarily
making
a
claim
under
the
narrower,
more
restrictive
federal
standard.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about...
what
about
the...
the
beck
condition
that
in
the
absence
of
the
instruction,
there
must
be
a
choice
between...
the
jury
must
be
confined
to
a
choice
between
death
and
acquittal?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
not
the
same
in
the
state's
scheme,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
goodin
the
case
that...
that
stands
for
the
proposition
that
under...
under
state
law,
the...
the
jury
has
an...
an
option
to
sentence
for
life,
as...
as
well
as...
as
to
impose
the
death
sentence?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
know
where
we
stand.
you're
saying
that
the
assumption
i
was
making,
that
under
mississippi
law,
in
the
absence
of
an
instruction
for
a
lesser
offense,
the
jury
has
an
option
not
only
to
acquit
or
to
impose
the
death
penalty,
but
an
option
of
life
with
or
without
parole,
that
assumption
is
simply
incorrect
as
a...
as
a
fact
about
mississippi
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
takes
you
out
of
beck,
at
least
arguably,
doesn't
it?
the...
the
question
is,
have
you
raised
something
that
is
necessarily
on
all
fours
with
beck?
and
given
this
sentencing
scheme,
we
can't
say
that
simply
raising
a
state
claim
necessarily
raises
the
beck
claim.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
consequence
of
the
jury
verdict
was...
was
the
death
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
wrote
it.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
that
the
case
here
too?
one
of
the
things
that's
neither
here
nor
there
i
guess,
but
one
of
the
things
that
perplexed
me
was
that
i
would
have
thought
that
the
lesser-included
offense
on...
on
the
theory
that
the...
that
he
didn't
intend
to
kill,
he
was
sprayed
with
mace,
got
mad,
pulled
out
a
gun,
and
shot
and
so
on...
i
would
have
thought
the
lesser-included
offense
was
a
heat
of
passion
kind
of
killing.
but
as...
as
i
read
the...
the
statement
of...
of
simple
murder,
which
requires
a
deliberate
act,
that
didn't
sound
like
it.
and
i...
i
read
negligent
homicide,
and
that
didn't
sound
like
heat
of
passion.
but
is...
is
it
your
point
here,
if...
if
we
get
into
it,
that
as
long
as
you
asked
for
some
lesser-includeds,
under
mississippi
law
that
raises
the
issue
adequately?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
fatal
to
him?
i
mean,
that's
what
we're...
one
of
the
things
we're
trying
to
get
at
i
guess.
is...
is
that
fatal
to
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
mississippi
law,
would
he
be
entitled
to
a
lesser
offense
instruction
if
he
asked
for
the
wrong
lesser
offense?
i.e.,
in
this
case,
if
he
failed
to
ask
for
heat
of
passion,
would
he
still
be
entitled
to
a
correct
lesser
instruction,
even
when
he
didn't
ask
for
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
say
he's
not
entitled
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
only
thing
he
would
be
entitled
to,
if
he
were
correct,
is
the
lesser
instruction
that
he
asked
for,
and
if
he's
not
correct,
there's
no
error.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
we're
just
trying
to
get
at
what
mississippi
law
is,
and
i
think
you've--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
go
back
to
the
heat
of
passion
point?
you
say
he
did
not
put
on
evidence,
but
wasn't
there
evidence
in
the
record
through
a
state's
witness
that
at
least
would
have
supported
a
heat
of
passion
argument,
the
evidence
being
that
he
went
up
to
the
car,
no
gun
was
apparent,
something
happened.
evidence
shows
that
he
was
sprayed
with
mace,
and
at
that
point,
he
pulls
out
a
gun
and
shoots.
that,
i
suppose,
is
evidence
of
heat
of
passion.
couldn't
he
have
asked
for
a
heat
of
passion
instruction
even
though
he
did
not
put
on
the
heat
of
passion
evidence
himself?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
he
did
not
do
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
manslaughter
being
defined
as
killing
without
deliberation?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
that's
what
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may...
may
i
ask
you?
i'm
unclear
on...
on
lesser-included
in
mississippi.
and
i'm
going
to
take
this
step
by
step.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
tell
me
if
i'm
right
or
wrong
at
each
step.
the
offense
that
he
was
charged
with...
the
capital
offense
that
he
was
charged
with
was
killing
with
or
without
intent
in
the
course
of
committing
a
crime.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
his
claim...
let's
assume
he
claimed
this.
there
is
evidence
from...
from
which
you...
you
could
infer
that
he
wasn't
committing
a
crime.
he
may
or
may
not
be
right,
but
let's
assume
that's
his
claim,
and
let's
assume
the
judge
says,
yes,
there's
some
evidence
that
would
indicate
that
he
wasn't
up
there
robbing
at
the
time
he
stood
next
to
the
car.
assume
the
judge
accepts
that.
he
then
says,
on
that
assumption,
i
want
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction
of
simple
murder,
killing
with
intent.
is
that
a
lesser-included
offense
under...
under
capital
murder?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
what
he's
saying
is,
i'm
asking
for
an
instruction
on
an
offense
which
is
lesser...
it
does
not...
it's
an
offense
that
doesn't
include
the
course
of
the
crime,
but
it
does
include
the
other
elements.
it
includes
killing
with
intent.
isn't
that
lesser-included
on
your
definition
of
mississippi
homicide
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i
mean,
he's
got
to
qualify
under
the
federal
standard.
he
says,
the
offense
i
was
charged
with
was
killing
with
or
without
intent,
plus
crime.
i
want
an
instruction
that
says
nothing
about
plus
crime
but
simply
charges
on
killing
with
or
without
intent.
isn't
he
asking
under
federal
law
for
a
lesser-included
instruction?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
confine
it
to
killing
with
intent.
justice
david
h.
souter
under...
under...
as
i
understood...
as
i
understood
you
to
define
the
capital
offense,
the
state
could
prove
the
capital
offense
by
saying
he
did
have
intent
when
he
killed
and
he
also
happened
to
be
committing
a
crime.
am
i
wrong
about
that
statement
of
mississippi
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
said
that
on
the
capital
offense,
the
killing
could
be
with
or
without
intent.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
the
mississippi
law
for
felony
murder
is
killing,
pure
and
simple,
plus
crime,
and
simple
murder
is
killing
plus
intent.
and
that
plus
intent
is
why
it
is
not
lesser-included.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
understand
you
now.
let...
let
me
ask
you
this
as
a
matter
of...
on...
on
the
second
point,
as
a
matter
of
mississippi
law.
under
the
charge
of
capital
murder,
was
there
a
possibility
of
sentencing
to
life
or
life
without
parole,
as
well
as
the
possibility
of
the
death
penalty
upon
conviction?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
that's
the
second
reason
why
it
would
not
fall
within
the...
the
beck
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
