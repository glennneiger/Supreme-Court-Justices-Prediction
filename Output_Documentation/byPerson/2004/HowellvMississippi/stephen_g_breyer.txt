stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
my
goodness,
all
it
requires...
look,
the
problem
is
not
a
technical
problem.
it's
a
human
problem.
a
judge
is
a
human
being.
he
gets
the
petition.
there
are
28
different
issues.
that's
a
lot
of
work.
he
goes
down
one,
two,
three,
four.
he
gets
to
this
issue,
which
is
somewhere
hidden
among
the
28,
and
what
it
says
is,
there
should
have
been
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction
and
it
cites
three
mississippi
cases,
which
in
turn
cite
one
other
case,
and
that...
that
other
case
says
that
the
mississippi
rule
has
constitutional
implications
and
cites
beck.
well,
i
mean,
if
that's
supposed
to
be
sufficient,
i
as
a
judge
would
have
to,
in
every
one
of
these
cases
that's
cited
in
these
28
different
issues,
start
looking
up
the
other
cases
in
mississippi
to
see
if
there's
some
other
place
they
cite
some
other
case
that
says
something
about
a
federal
case.
i
mean,
you
see
it's
impossible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
isn't
even
because,
after
all,
beck
talked
about
an
instruction
where
the
choice
was
either
convict
the
person
of
murder,
death
penalty,
or
acquit
him,
and
your
case
happens
to
involve
an
instruction
which
said
to
the
jury,
convict
him
or
give
him
a
life
sentence
or
acquit
him.
so
we
don't
even
know
if...
if
beck
applies
to
your
case.
that's
never
been
decided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
even
know...
i
am
so
ignorant
i
don't
even
know
if
schad
is
a
federal
case
or
a
state
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
guess
if
he
had,
he
should
have
said
fed.
or
u.s.
or
whatever
it
is
so
that
i'll
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
seem
like
such
a
burden.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
supreme
court?
yes,
that's
probably
pretty
clear
it's
federal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
he
meant
the
state
supreme
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i'm
saying
you
don't
carry
it
to
extremes.
don't
be
ridiculous
about
it,
but
that
isn't
an
extreme
case
we
have.
we
have
which
is
the
case
we
have,
the
state,
and
then
three
state
cases,
and
then
referring
to
one
state
case
that
says
that
beck
is...
is
a
constitutional
implication
citing
beck.
i
mean,
i
don't
have
to
be
extreme
in
order
to
say
yours
isn't
that
extreme
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
the
question
is
suppose
we
have
a
different
case,
not
this
case.
everything
is
the
same
but
for
the
fact
we
know
for
sure
it
wasn't
a
robbery.
that's
all.
now,
in
that
different
case,
is
it
a
crime
under
the
law
of
mississippi
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
told
you
everything
about
the
case.
it's
just
like
this
one
except
we
know
it
isn't
a
robbery.
now,
is
it
a
crime?
the
answer
we
think
is
absolutely
it's
a
crime.
and
my
next
question
is
which
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
which
crime
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
so
it
would
be
something.
what
would
it
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then
maybe
there's
a
felony--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
anything
else
possible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
manslaughter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
odd
that
in
mississippi
people
just
go
around
shooting
each
other
all
the
time
and
there's
no
statute
that
seems
to
cover
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
there
must
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no.
they
just
do
it...
who
knows
why.
all
we
know
about
them
is
they
went
and
killed
somebody.
now,
i
think
it's
still
a
crime
to
kill
people
in,
i
thought,
all
50
states,
but...
but--
[laughter]
so
i'm
going
to
say
which--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
so
what...
but...
but
the
line
of
reasoning
is...
is...
now,
there
is
a
crime.
let's
call
it
x.
all
right?
and
what
you're...
what
counsel
says
is
it's
the
law
of
mississippi
that
if
there
is
a
crime
and
it's
x
and
it's
lesser,
you've
got
to
charge
it
if
somebody
just
says,
please
give
me
a
lesser-included
instruction,
even
if
he's
all
mixed
up
as
to
what
the
right
crime
is.
i
don't
know
if
that's
the
law
of
mississippi.
from
reading
the
mississippi
supreme
court
opinion,
i
would
say
it
wasn't
the
law
of
mississippi
because
they
say
you're
not
supposed
to
charge
people
in
ways
that
would
mix
them
up.
but,
i
mean,
anyway...
but
that's
the
argument.
so
what's
the
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
don't
take
the
one
i
just
suggested
because
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
what
is
your
response?
