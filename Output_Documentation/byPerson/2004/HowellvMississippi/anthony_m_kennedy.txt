justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
souter
was...
was
a
state
court
judge
as
well.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
still
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question.
i
had
the...
i
had
the
same
problem.
the
evidence
of
robbery
here
was
circumstantial,
strong,
but
still
circumstantial
based
on
his
earlier
statements
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
sting,
i
think
he
said,
and
then
the
witness
saw
him
outside
the
window
and...
and
he
stopped
the
car.
and
i
take
it,
he
didn't
take
the
stand
and
say,
i
stopped
the
car
to
ask
for
directions
or
something.
but
still
it's...
it's...
that's
certainly
a
jury
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
a
robbery.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
would
the
state
of
mississippi
take
the
position
that
if
there
was
no
robbery,
there
was
no
crime
in
this
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
a
man
is
shot
and
killed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
i'm
talking
about
just
mississippi
law.
you're
the
prosecutor
saying,
we...
we
may
not
get
robbery
here.
the...
is
that
the
only
thing
they
charge
is
robbery
or
let
the
man
go
after
he
shoots
and
kills
the
person
he
doesn't
even
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
you
don't
know
someone,
then
it's
not
murder?
[laughter]
i
don't
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let...
let
me
ask...
ask
you
this.
knowing
what
we
know
now,
we
have
the
record,
we
have
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
we
know
the
evidence,
in
your
view
now
what
would
have
been
the
closest
lesser-included
offense
for
which
an
instruction
might
have
been
sought?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
works
against
you
because
it
takes
away
from
the
jury
the
option
of
saying,
well,
we'll
convict
him
of
a
serious
offense,
but
we'll
be
sure
not
to
give
him
a
capital
offense.
so
that...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
then
works
against
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your...
were
the
two
principal
lesser-included
offenses
in...
in
your
view
your
d-13
and
d-18
that
are
in
the
appendix?
