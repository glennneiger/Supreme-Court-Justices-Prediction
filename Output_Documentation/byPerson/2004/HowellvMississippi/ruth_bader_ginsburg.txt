justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
was
that...
where
was
that
maintained?
because
i
thought
that
below,
all
there
were
this
was
a...
was
it
a
lesser-included
offense
under
state
law,
and
i
didn't
see
below
any
reference
to
the
federal
constitution.
justice

mr.
mitchell,
what
gives
me
pause
is
that
there
are
mississippi
cases...
you
no
doubt
know
them...
where
the
court
has
seemed
to
think
that
the
federal
issue
under
beck
was
discrete
from
the
state
issue.
so
i
forgot
the
name
of
them,
but
one
of
them
was
striking
because
it
says
this
doesn't
run
afoul
of
beck,
and
then
it
says,
now
we
turn
to
mississippi
law
on
lesser-included
offense.
and
it...
the...
the
state
supreme
court
treated
those
two
as
discrete.
so
when
you
just
say
lesser-included
offense,
why
should
the
court
assume
that
you're
talking
about
one
rather
than
the
other
when
the
mississippi
supreme
court
itself
has
made
it
clear
that
it
thinks
they
are
discrete
inquiries?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
what
would
be
a
lesser-included
offense?
because
if
it's
not
simple
murder
and
it's
not
manslaughter,
you
haven't
suggested
a
third
that
it
might
be.
i
thought
your
whole
position
was
that
this
simple
murder
was
right
and
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
judge
was
obliged
to
give
it.
so
why...
in
view
of
what
justice
souter
just
said
about
simple
murder
requiring
a
deliberate
design,
where
was
the
deliberate
design
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
would
be
if
it
were
not?
what
would
be
the
lesser-included
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
make
it...
if
we
make
it
concrete,
let's
take
all
that
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
testimony
that
rice
gave.
rice
was
the
one
who
observed
this
murder,
and
he
didn't
have
any
statements
about
the
defendant
needing
money
to
pay
off
his
debt.
you
have
only
that
snapshot
scene
of
what
the
witness
saw
from
the
window,
which
doesn't
establish
any
robbery
at
all
because
rice
said
he
didn't
observe
any
robbery
going
on.
all
he
observed
was
the
killing.
now,
if
that's
all
you
have
in
this
case,
a
person
was
killed,
an
eyewitness
to
the
shooting,
the
eyewitness
testifies
exactly
as
mr.
rice
did
in
this
case,
what
crime
would
you
indict
for?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'm
giving
you
a
hypothetical
where--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
all
you
have--
