mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
submit
that
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
prohibits
an
employment
practice
that
has
a
significant
disparate
impact
on
older
workers
if
that
practice
lacks
any
reasonable
business
justification.
the
adea
embodies
congress'
determination
that
age
discrimination
seriously
impedes
older
americans'
ability
to
participate
fairly
in
the
american
work
force.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
stevens,
there
is
not
a
clear
answer
to
that
question
in
all
candor.
it
is
not
before
the
court.
i
will
tell
you
that
the
lower
courts
uniformly
in
the
adea
disparate
impact
context
apply
justice
o'connor's
plurality
opinion
in
watson
and
the
wards
cove
rule
rather
than
the
post-1991
civil
rights
act
rule.
that
is
a
debatable
proposition
because,
as
your
question
suggests,
in
subsection
(f)(1)
of
the
statute
where
this
provision
comes
from...
and
let
me
just
take
us
to
the
language.
it
would
probably
be
most
useful.
in
the
blue
book,
the...
the
blue
petitioners'
brief
at
page
1
are
the
relevant
provisions.
(a)(2)
we'll
come
back
to.
that's
the
parallel
language
to
griggs.
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
provision
is
(f)(1),
and
it
says:
it
shall
not
be
unlawful
for
an...
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
it
shall
not
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
take
any
action
otherwise
prohibited...
and
i'm
going
to
come
back
and
focus
on
that...
under
subsection
(a)
where
the
differentiation
is
based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
the
fact
that
it
says
otherwise
prohibited
seems
to
suggest
that
this
is
setting
up
an
employer
defense,
as
your
question
indicates.
and
the
court
in
the...
the
western
air
lines
case
in
1986
said
that
the
bfoq
provision,
which
is
in
(f)(1)
as
well,
is
an
affirmative
defense.
so
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
can
tell
you.
[laughter]
the
answer
is
that
you
should
recognize,
as
does
the
commission,
which
has
delegated
rulemaking
authority
under
the
act,
that
business
necessity,
which
is
the
term
of
art
that
they
used
in
the
regulation...
and
we'll
come
back
to
it.
it's
at
page
2
of
the
blue
brief...
means
different
things
in
different
contexts.
and
so
i
want
to
take
you
to
the
specific
citations
where
the
eeoc
has
recognized
the
common
sense
principle.
we
know
that
more
things
that
are
legitimate
employer
practices
correlate
with
age
than
they
do
with
race
and
gender.
it
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
our
position
relies
only
on
the
statute.
we
embrace
the
text
of
the
statute.
(f)(1)
says
that
the
employer's
conduct
merely
has
to
be
reasonable.
we
agree
with
that.
the
point
i
would
then
take
you
to
is
that
in...
if
the
court
were
interested
in
the
regulation...
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
get
to
the
regulation,
but
if
it
were,
the
eeoc
has
said
that
it
too
recognizes
that
the
phrase,
business
necessity,
in
the
context
of
the
age
act
does
not
mean
essential
to
the
business.
let
me
tell
you
why
it
used
the
language
it
did,
business
necessity,
in
the
regulation
just
to
clear
it
up.
and
that
is
when
this
court
first
used
the
words,
business
necessity,
in
griggs
and
then
subsequently
in
wards
cove,
it
didn't
have
all
the
connotations
that
it
does
now
as
being
quite
a
high
employer
burden.
if
i
could
just
read
to
you
two
things
from
griggs.
griggs
said,
the
touchstone
is
business
necessity.
if
the
employment
practice
cannot
be
shown
to
be
related
to
job
performance,
the
practice
is
prohibited.
it
simply
required
related
to
job
performance.
that's
the
backdrop
on
which
the
eeoc
used
the
word.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
my
point
is
only
terminological,
and
that
is,
when
the
eeoc
used
those
words,
it
did
not
do
so
against
a
backdrop
in
which
they
carried
a
connotation
that
was
necessarily
very
strict,
and
it
has
said
several
times...
and
they
are
quoted
in
our
brief...
that
the
standard...
and
this
is
just
the
bottom
line.
i
think
it's
a
very
important
bottom
line.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
do
care
about
the
regulations.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
we
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
can
and
will.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
do
believe
that
it
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference
because
they
have
delegated
rulemaking
authority
and
there
is
some
suggestion
that
the
because
of
language
in
subsection--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
a
post-notice
and
comment
rule.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
conceivable
you
could
read
it
that
way,
although
the
eeoc
has
specified
many
times,
in
the
quarter
century
since
it
enacted
the
regulation,
that
no,
when
we...
and
let
me
take
us
to
the
text
to
explain
why,
and
that
again
is
at
page
2
of
the
blue
brief.
they
said...
and
this
is
the
block
quote.
when
an
employment
practice,
including
a
test,
is
claimed
as
a
basis
for
different
treatment
of
employees
or
applicants
for
employment
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
a
factor
other
than
age,
and
such
practice
has
an
adverse
impact
on
individuals.
that's
the
reference
to
disparate
impact.
the
regulatory
materials
cite
to
griggs.
but
in
all
events,
i
do
want
to
come
back
to
the
bottom
line,
and
that
is
the
eeoc
recognizes,
we
recognize
that
it's
easier
to
prove
either
a
defense
or
to
put
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff's
case.
it's
a...
you
have
a
higher
hurdle--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
let
me
take
you
to
the
lines
of
cases
that
i
think
might
concern
you.
there
were
a
set
of
cases
before
this
court's
decision
in
hazen
paper
that
involved
two
rules,
justice
breyer,
and
i
will
tell
you
that
you
referred
to
in
the
adams
oral
argument
when
this
case...
this
issue
came
to
you
before.
and
so
i
want
to
refer
to
a
very
specific
set
of
cases.
there
were
a
set
of
cases
before
1993
in
which
there
was
some
correlation.
high
salary
correlated
with
age.
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
third...
the
second
circuit
in
the
geller
case
and
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
leftwich
case
treated
that
as
effectively
a
disparate
treatment...
disparate
treatment
case
because
of
the
high
level
of
correlation.
the
more
recent
cases
reject
that
result
and
we
embrace
the
more
recent
cases.
and
i
want
to
cite
them
to
you
so
you
could
look
them
up
if
you
wanted.
the
evers
case,
which
is
241
f.
3d
948;
the
williams
case,
which
is
112
f.
supp.
2d
267;
and
the
last
one
is
newport
mesa,
893
f.
supp.
927.
these
cases
recognized
that
cost
is
a
perfectly
legitime
business
justification,
and
they
put
a
single
burden
on
the
employer.
now,
let
me
just...
just
to
say,
most
impact
cases
aren't
cost
cases,
but
i
know
it's
a
concern.
they
say,
look,
if
you
want
to
cut
your
costs
and
get
rid
of
your
more
expensive
work
force,
we're
only
going
to
ask
you
to
do
one
thing,
and
that
is
allow
your
more
senior
workers
to
take
a
pay
cut.
they
do
not
say,
as
did
the
older
cases,
that
it
causes
disparate
impact
and
you
lose
your
case.
and
so
we
don't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
o'connor,
the
lower
courts
unanimously
conclude,
as
does
the
commission,
that
(a)(2),
although
it
does
not
have
the
word
compensation
in
it,
does
apply
to
compensation
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--because
they
understand
4(a)...
and
let
me
take
you...
everyone
to
the
text
just
so
we
can
all
be
literally
on
the
same
page,
and
that
is
going
to
be
in
the
red
brief
at
page
17a.
it
is
623(a),
and
it's
the
first
block
quote
at
the
top
of
page
17a
of
the
red
brief.
they
understand
that
623(a)(1)
refers
to
actions
against
individuals,
whereas
623(a)(2)
refers
to
actions
against
groups,
group
policy
versus
individual
action,
and
they
do
that
because
of
the
introductory
language
to
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2),
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire
or
to
discharge
any
individual;
whereas,
(a)(2)
refers
to
limit,
segregate,
or
classify
his
employees.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
hazen
paper
established
that
that
is
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
may
misunderstand
the
hypothetical,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
that's
perfectly
legitimate.
that...
as
i
understand
the
hypothetical--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
it
would
not
because
the
rationale
given
by
the
employer
here
for...
let...
let
me
take
us
to
the
facts
and
then
the
explanation
that's
given
by
the
employer.
what
happened
here
is
they
gave
all
of
the
line
police
officers
much
bigger
raises
than
they
gave
to
the
more
senior
officers.
that...
and
the
difference
in
pay
between
protected
persons
under
the
adea
and
non-protected
persons
was
4
standard
deviations,
a
1
in
10,000
chance,
statisticians
will
tell
you.
and
they
said--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
basis
for
differentiation
was
years
of
service,
but
the
question
is
in...
is
it
a
reasonable
choice
by
the
employer
in
this
context.
and
the
reason
is
it's
a--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
apologize.
that...
and
so
i
think
i
answered
your
hypothetical
too
broadly.
and
that
is,
it
depends.
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
employers
certainly
can
say
i
want
to
give
a
class
of
employees
more
money.
perfectly
sensible.
congress
didn't
intend
to
block
that.
but
the
question
is,
is
this
outside
the
usual
set
of
cases?
and
the
city's
explanation
what...
for
this
policy,
which
was
to
give
the
line
cops
more
money
but
not
the
rest
of
the
cops
who
happen
to
all
be
over
40,
was
that
they
wanted
to
bring
the
salary
up
to
a...
a
regional
average.
and
so
we
asked
the
question,
does
this
accomplish
that
in
a
reasonable
way,
and
it
does
not
because
they
left
out
huge
categories
of
employees.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
not
the
facts
here.
that's
right.
they...
they
did
not
say
we
are
going
to
give
pay
raises
to
the
people
who
have
lesser
years
of
service
because
we're
concerned
about
their
pay.
to
the
contrary.
let
me
take
you
to
one
piece
of
the
record
that
i
think
will
be
helpful.
although
again
the
cases
presents
the
legal
question,
the
lower
court
on
remand
can
resolve
the
case.
but
at
page
15
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
is
the
pay
plan
itself,
and
the
first
sentence
is
that...
they...
explains
the
purpose.
the...
the
city
wanted
to
provide
a
compensation
plan
that
will
attract
and
retain
qualified
people,
and
then
it
says,
to
all
employees
regardless
of
age.
they
purported
to
be
giving
the
same
treatment
to
everyone
regardless--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
stevens,
i...
i
just
think
that...
it
misunderstands
the
facts
as
i
know
them
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
criterion
was
that
they
took
the...
they
had
different
kinds
of
officers.
they
had
police...
line
police
officers,
master
sergeants,
all
the
way
on
up
through
the
system.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
and
then--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
question
is
not
whether
that
because
that's
not...
having
those
criterion
is
perfectly
reasonable.
the
question
is,
is
it
reasonable...
and
this
would
be
resolved
on
remand...
to
give
raises
to
only
one
of
those
categories
when
your
explanation
is
that
you
were
trying
to
give
raises
to
bring
everyone
up
to
a
regional
average?
and
so,
justice
stevens,
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
there
are
two
things.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
oh,
i...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
it's
the
same
question
that
we
ask
in
title
vii,
and
that
is,
was
it
a...
a...
there's
a
higher
bar
there,
but
were
you
pursuing
a...
a
legitimate
goal
and
did
you...
did
you
pursue
it
in
a
reasonable
way?
that's
why
a
title
vii
plaintiff...
and
this
has...
and
i
do
want
to
come
back--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
absolutely
right,
but
it's
not
language
here
that
would
detract
from
that
structure
of
the...
of
the
title
vii
inquiry.
all
the
lower
courts,
for
example,
agree
that
it...
as
i
said,
follows
the
pre--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
they
give--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
they
give
an
explanation.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no.
you
would
lose
a
treatment
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
paid
the
lower
paid
workers
more?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you,
in
all
likelihood,
win
in
that
hypothetical.
you--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
but
let
me
tell
you,
it's
still
a
very
important
statute
because...
for
the
reason
that
i
framed
before,
and
that
is,
most
cases
that
are
adea
disparate
impact
cases
are
not
cost
cases.
there
are
other
tests:
applications
procedures,
strength
tests,
and
the
like.
that's
what
the
eeoc
believes
is
still
very
essential.
so
while
we
don't
impose
a
big
burden
on
employers
in
the
cost
context
for
the
reasons
that
you
and
justice
stevens
have
been
exploring,
that
doesn't
mean
our
position
is
somehow
worthless.
the
eeoc
has
said
that
the
disparate
impact
plays
a,
quote/unquote,
vital
role
under
the
adea
and
that
the
respondents'
position
would
greatly
weaken
the
statute
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
i
can.
i'll
give
you
two
sets
of
examples.
the
first
is
the
examples
identified
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
cert
petition
defending
the
eeoc's
position
in
the
francis
w.
parker
case
in
1994.
the
eeoc
pursued
cases...
and
they're
cited
in
the
cert
petition...
involving
rules
that
prohibit...
that
require
recent
college
graduates
to
get
a
job
that
forbid
hiring
someone
who
worked
previously
for
a
higher
salary
than
they
would
be
getting
in
the
new...
in
the
new
job
and
that
laid
off
people
who
would
be
eligible
to
retire
soon.
so
those
are
the
examples
the
solicitor
general
gave.
i'll
give
you
two
other
examples.
one
is
a...
a
case
called--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--violations.
i
apologize.
the
eeoc
filed
suit
because
of
these
violations
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
it's
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
view
of
the
commission...
it's
one
i
share,
but
a
particular
court
might
not...
is
that
that
is
not
a
good...
a
reasonable
work
place
judgment.
one
could
disagree
with
it.
but
the...
those
employees
will
be
very
valuable.
and
it's
not
that
they
will
retire,
i
should
make
clear.
it's
that
they're
eligible
to
retire.
it...
it
may
well
be
a
different
case
if
you
could
say,
i
asked
the
person.
they
said
they're
leaving
in
a
year.
the
rule
challenged
there
was
mere
eligibility
to
retire,
and
they
did
give
the
other
examples.
i
didn't
finish
with
the
court
cases.
they
are
klein,
which
is
807
f.
supp.
1517,
which
is
a
hiring
test
i
think
by
the
faa
in
that
case
that...
that
happened
to
exclude
all
of
the
people,
i
think,
over
the
age
of
55.
and
there
are
other
cases
that
are,
in
the
line
of
cases
that
i
was
discussing
with
justice
breyer,
in
which
the
employer
doesn't
say...
doesn't
give
the
person
who
gets
the
higher
pay
the
option
of
taking
a
pay
cut
before
being
fired.
so
the
statute,
both
in
the
non-cost
context
and
the
cost
context,
has
very
important
applications.
i
did
want
to
return
to
your
correct
premise,
however,
justice
ginsburg.
you
said
there
aren't
many
cases.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the...
the
important,
legitimate
cases,
by
and
large,
are
conciliated
by
the
eeoc.
remember,
it
goes
through
an
administrative
process
first.
the
eeoc
found
a
violation
here,
gave
us
a
right
to
sue
letter.
the...
the
city
just
declined
to
settle
with
us.
there
have
been...
and
i
have
checked.
there
have
been
74
disparate
impact
cases
in
the
history
of
the
statute
that
are
reported
in
the
federal
courts,
and
i
think
that
is
a
good
answer
to
the
idea
of
the
respondents
that
this
will
impose
a
huge
burden
on
employers,
the
idea
that
there
will
be
a
massive
amount
of
litigation.
remember--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it's
possible
it
would
expand
some,
but
i
do
think
we're
right
to
say
not
much
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
there
are
two
fears
i
think
the
respondents
have
articulated,
neither
of
which
are
borne
out
by
actual
experience
because,
justice
o'connor,
the
eeoc
has
recognized
these
claims
for
a
quarter
century.
until
1993,
every
single
circuit
agreed
with
us,
and
right
now
three
circuits
agree
with
us.
so
i...
there
is
a
large
body
of
experience
that
suggests...
and
that's
where
those
74
cases
come
from.
so,
justice
breyer,
they
have
two
concerns.
one
is
the
mere
notion
of
the
possibility
of
liability
will...
and
the
prospect
of
how
expensive
litigation
would
be...
would
be
deterring
valuable
employment
practices.
that's
not
borne
out
by
experience.
your
point
is,
well,
what
if
the
liability
threshold
is
too
high?
and
experience
suggests
and
the
rules
endorsed
by
the
commission
and
the
lower
courts
are
that
the
liability
threshold
is
not
too
high.
i
did
also
want
to
say
that
it
is
the
liability
threshold
that
is
the
key
for
deciding
how
to
accommodate
the
respondents'
concerns.
justice
o'connor's
watson
plurality
opinion
explains
that
the
evidentiary
standards
that
apply
in
these
disparate
impact
cases
should
serve
as
adequate
safeguards.
the
precise,
same
argument
was
made
by
the
business
community
in
watson,
saying,
look,
we're
going
to
have
to
adopt
quotas.
this
will
be
entirely
unmanageable.
before
i
sit
down
and
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
i
did
want
to
say
we
have
a
really
good
case,
to
refer
back
to
my
last
argument,
and
that's
griggs,
which
is
about
the
exact
same
statutory
text.
and
then
we
have
a
line,
a
wall
that
is
uninterrupted
of
this
court's
authority.
six
straight
decisions
say
when
the
statute...
title
vii
says
something
and
the
adea
says
the
same
thing,
they
have
the
parallel
construction.
and
in
our
view
the
respondents'
arguments
aren't
good
enough
to
overcome
the
double
hurdle
of
stare
decisis
and
chevron
deference.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
want
to
start
with
our
affirmative
case
which
is
one
of
stare
decisis
and
then
go
to
what
i
think
is
the
thing
that
might
concern
the
court
and
that's
the
practicalities
of
implementing
our
rule.
our
stare
decisis
case
i
think
is
fairly
decisive.
the
language
of
title
vii
was
the
model
for
the
adea.
it
runs
all
the
way
through
the
same
in
subsection
(a)(2).
this
court
construed
the
text
of
the
statute
to
give
rise
to
disparate
impact
liability,
and
there
are
six
cases
of
this
court
that
say
when
the
language
is
the
same,
because
one
was
derived
from
the
other,
we
give
them
the
same
meaning.
now,
i
take
it
that
the
respondents
have
three
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
they
attempt
to
rewrite
the
rationale
of
griggs
and
say
griggs
really
isn't
so
much
about
the
text
of
the
statute.
it's
what
congress
was
getting
after,
and
this
court
in
griggs
was
principally
concerned
with
the
fact
that,
look,
in
the
context
of
age
and
sex
discrimination,
there's
no
legitimate
correlation
between
an...
a
disparate
impact
and
a
legitimate
employer
policy.
that
is
not,
in
fact,
what
the
rationale
of
griggs
is.
the
rationale
of
griggs
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
to
the
employee
if
you
are
purposefully
discriminated
against
or
accidentally
discriminated
against.
congress
was
concerned
with
the
effects
of
discrimination.
and
this
court
reached
that
conclusion
based
on
the
text
of
the
statute.
if
i
could
read
from
griggs,
quote,
the
objective
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
title
vii
is
plain
from
the
language
of
the
statute.
that's
the
same
language
as
in
our
statute.
the
thrust
of
section
703(a)(2)
was
to
address,
quote,
the
consequences
of
employment
practices,
not
simply
the
motivation.
this
court
subsequently
reiterated
twice
that
disparate
impact
comes
from
the
text
of
the
statute,
not
from
the
air.
those
two
cases
are
quoted
at
page
9
of
our
reply
brief
and
they
resolve
all
doubts
about
commas
and
because
of
or
anything
like
that.
the
court
in
both
connecticut
v.
teal
and
justice
o'connor's
opinion
for
the
court
in
watson
tied
it
directly
to
the
statute.
if
i
could
just
read
the
watson
example.
again,
they're
quoted
in
full.
in
disparate
impact
cases,
quote,
the
employer's
practices
may
be
said
to,
quote,
adversely
affect
an
individual's
status
as
an
employee
because
of
such
individual's
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin.
now,
the
second
argument
they
have...
and
this
was
the
fifth
circuit's
argument...
is
the
rfoa
provision
exists
in
the
adea,
not
in
title
vii.
i
do
not
understand
how
the
rfoa
provision...
if
it
means
anything,
it
doesn't
help
us.
again,
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
text.
it's
on
page
1
of
the
blue
brief.
it's
in
a
few
other
places,
but
it's
there.
it
shall
not
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
take
any
action
otherwise
prohibited
under
subsection
(a)
where
the
differentiation
is
based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
the
necessary
premise
of
that
provision
is
that
something
will
be
otherwise
unlawful
when
it's
based
on
something
other
than
age.
it
can't
be
talking
about
disparate
treatment.
the
only
kind
of
liability
that
involves
factors
other
than
age
is
impact.
and
then
on
top
of
that,
congress
required
that
the
employer's
conduct
be
reasonable.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
the
statute
refers
to
something
otherwise
unlawful,
it
can't
be
talking
about
price
waterhouse
mixed
motive.
price
waterhouse
mixed
motive
cases
establish
liability;
i.e.,
you're
not
liable
if
you
had
another
reason
for
doing
it.
but
the
premise
of
(f)(1)
is
if
it's
already
otherwise
unlawful,
this
is
a
defense
to
that.
the
third
thing
that
they
say
is
that
in
hazen
paper
this
court
construed
the
because
of
language
in
(a)(1)
not
to
refer
to
impact.
the
critical
difference
is
that
the
(a)(1)
language
does
not
include
the...
the
clause
that
refers
to
the
impact
on
the
employee
that
justice
stevens
and
justice
breyer
talked
about
with
mr.
nager.
they're
structured
very
differently.
as
to
the
practicalities,
let
me
just
say
this
has
been
the
rule
for
a
quarter
century
of
the
eeoc.
it
was
the
rule
in
every
circuit
until
1993.
it
is
still
the
rule
in
three
circuits.
the
notion
that
there
is
a
big
problem
with
administering
it
and
that
the
eeoc
can't
recognize
the...
as
it
has
in
all
the
examples
we
cite,
that
it's
easier
for
an
employer
to
prevail
in
the
adea
context
is
not
accurate.
i
also
want
to
just
agree
with
justice
breyer,
that
an
important
part
of
impact
liability
is
just
making
employers
think
about
it.
and
that
comes
from
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
mckennon
where
he
said
that
disparate
impact,
quote,
acts
as
a
spur
or
catalyst
to
cause
employers
to
self-examine
and
self-evaluate
their
employment
practices
to
endeavor
to
eliminate,
so
far
as
possible,
the
last
vestiges
of
discrimination.
