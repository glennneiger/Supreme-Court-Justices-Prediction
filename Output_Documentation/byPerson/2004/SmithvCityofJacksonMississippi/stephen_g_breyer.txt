justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
put
your
finger
on
exactly
what's
the
part
of
this
case
that's
bothering
me.
read
through
the
language.
as
you
read
through
the
language,
disparate
impact
does
seem
to
be
called
for,
and
this
particular
provision,
reasonable
factors
other
than
age,
seems
a
defense
to
that,
just
as
bfoq
is
the
defense
to
disparate
treatment.
and
that
all
seems
to
work.
but
you
read
the
definition
of
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
to
mean
business
necessity
or
even
justice
o'connor's
opinion,
which
is
pretty
tough.
it's
hard
for
an
employer
to
make
that
defense.
and
while
making
it
hard
to
make
that
defense
in
the
case
of
gender
or
race
discrimination,
in
fact
works
in
my
opinion
perfectly
well.
you
start
making
it
hard
to
make
that
defense
here
and
you're
going
to
have
a
nightmare
because
every
effort
by
any
employer
to
equalize
to
any
degree
pay
or
treatment
of
his
or
her
employees
is
going
to
have
a
disparate
impact
in
respect
to
age
because
the
correlation
with
age
runs
into
all
kinds
of
things
that
it
doesn't
in
the
other
cases.
so
i
can't
believe
that
congress
really
would
have
wanted
that,
but
the
reason
i
can't
believe
it
is
because
i
can't
believe
the
business
necessity
part
of
it.
and
so
here
i'm
faced
with
a
reg
which,
at
one
and
the
same
time,
pulls
in
disparate
impact
and
business
necessity,
and
now
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
easier...
easier
is
a
matter
of
degree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
reasonable
factor
could
be
interpreted
to
say
what
the
employer...
but
the
employer
just
doesn't
like
paying
these
executives
so
much
money
when
these
new
younger
janitors
make
so
little.
and
so
he
says,
i
want
to
pay
the
new
younger
janitors
more.
okay?
there
we've
got
it.
disparate
impact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
you
say,
what's
the
business
necessity?
and
frankly,
there
wasn't
one.
it's
just
that
i
found
it
sort
of
bad.
all
right?
so
there
we
are.
i've
lost
my
case.
now,
that's
what
is
worrying
me,
and
i
thought
perhaps
this
reg
that
seems
to
say...
and
lower
courts
have
accepted
that
i
would
lose
my
case...
that
this
reg
is
outside
congress'...
the
agency's
authority
for
that
reason
because
congress
couldn't
have
intended
that
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
i
want--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
here...
here
you're
saying
you're
not
attacking
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
it
has
to
be
based
on
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
and
i
take
it
here
you're
saying
it's
not
based
on
what
they
advance
as
reasonable
factors.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
i...
i
say
my
explanation
for
why
i
pay
the
newer
people
more
is
really
i
like
to
have
that
atmosphere.
you
make
less
money
in
my
business,
but
it's
more
democratic
and
people
are
happier
even
though
no
one
will
invest
in
my
company.
[laughter]
but
still,
i'd
like
a
commune.
all
right?
that's
how
i
want
to
do
it.
now,
that's
not
totally
idiotic.
it's
plausible.
so
i
just
win.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
i
lose
a
treatment
case.
no,
no.
i'm
not...
i'm
just...
it's
i'm
not
paying
the
younger
workers
more.
i'm
paying
the
newer
workers
more.
all
right?
they
happen
to
be
much
the
same
category,
but
i...
i
don't
want
it.
it's
not
age.
or,
you
know,
i
pay
the
lower
paid
workers
more.
how's
that?
do
i
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i
paid
the
lower
paid
workers
more?
i
want
to
bring
them
up
to
the
executives.
i...
i
like
it.
it's
more
democratic
and
it
makes
a
happier
group.
and...
and
so,
now,
do
i
win
or
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
win.
and
i
don't
have
to
say
any
more
than
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
not
the
number
of
cases
either.
i
mean,
you
could
have...
it
wouldn't
take
much
to
have
a
single
case
that
has
a
rule
in
it,
say,
that
makes
it
very
difficult
for
an
employer
to
do
things
of
type
x
or
type
y,
and
that
would
have
enormous
impact
even
though
you'd
say,
well,
it
was
just
one
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
that's
true,
but
they...
they
did
promulgate
this
guideline,
as
far
as...
i
looked
it
up.
at
that
time,
they
said,
look,
it's
going
to
be
disparate
impact,
and
they
cited
griggs.
and
people
have
put
comments,
which
i
haven't
read
yet,
but
i
imagine
the
comments
went
to
disparate
impact.
and
then
when
they
rewrote
it
in
this
form,
they
have
a
little
paragraph
of
explanation
which
makes
pretty
clear
it's
meant
to
be
disparate
impact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right.
but
i
mean,
they...
everybody
knew
what
they
were
driving
at
at
the
time
they
promulgated
this.
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
if...
if
we're
not
governed
by
the
reg,
it
must
be
because
the
reg
is
outside
the
statutory
authority.
and
it
might
be
outside
the
statutory
authority
if
in
fact
it
embodies
too
tough
a
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now
we've
heard
it
doesn't
embody
that
much
of
a
tough
test,
and
you
know,
the
eeoc
isn't
here
to
tell
us--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
in
fact
it
thinks.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
we
don't
know
what
the
government's
position
is.
they're
not
here.
so
suppose
i
think,
one,
the
language
is
against
you,
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
do
think
it's
against
you.
two,
the
eeoc
reg
does
foresee
a
disparate
impact
test.
three,
the
practicalities
are
absolutely
with
you,
and
that
has
to
go
with
the
scope
of
the
statute.
and
four,
it
might
be
possible
for
the
eeoc
to
write
a
reg
that
deals
with
the
problems
you're
worried
about
while
advancing
a
disparate
impact
test.
suppose
i
think
all
those
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
are
at
least
consistent.
what
would
i
do
with
this
case?
that's
my
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
the
government
hasn't
appeared
and
told
us
what
they
want
to
do
or
what
they
think
should
be
done,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
would
be
a
fairly
easy
burden...
a
fairly
easy
burden
to
me.
and...
and
to
give
you
a
fairly
easy
burden
is
consistent
with
the
idea
of
trying
to
get
employers
to
think
about
the
problem.
an
employer
who
uses
a
different
factor
which
is
correlated
with
age
but
it's...
it's
an
unreasonable
thing
to
do
or
it
isn't
the
real
basis
hasn't
thought
about
the
harm
that
he's
working.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
could
give
you
an
easy
burden
and
still
accomplish
the
objective.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
how
does
that
work?
because
the...
the
particular
language,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
classify
his
employees
in
any
way
that
would
adversely
affect
an
individual's
status...
his
status,
it
says...
as
an
employee
because
of
such
individual's
age.
now,
that
sounds
as
if
it's
driving
right
at
disparate
impact.
it's...
it's
unlawful
to
classify
an
employee
in
any
way
that
would
adversely
affect
him
because
of
his
age.
that's
what
it
says.
and
then
you
turn
to
defense
and
it
says,
but
there's
the
defense
with
a
differentiation,
i.e.,
the
classification
is
based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
and
therefore
it
would
sound
as
if
it
says,
look
at
the
factor
and
ask
is
the
factor
reasonable.
if
so,
the
employer
wins
if
it's
really
based
on
that
factor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
we
get
out
of
that
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
it
says...
it
says
that
would
adversely
affect
him
because
of
his
age.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no.
it's
not
intent
because
if
you
read
it
as
a
part
of
classifying,
which
you'd
have
to
do
to
get
it
because
of
intent,
you'd
have
to
say
to
classify
his
employees
because
of
such
individual's
age.
now,
that's
a
little
tough
because
you're
talking
about
employees,
and
then
you
go
to
such
individual.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be
the
natural
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
natural
way...
wait.
the
natural
way
is
to
read
it
as
modifying
to
deprive--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
otherwise
adversely
affect.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
natural
way
to
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
we
read
it
that
way.
then
what
do
you
say?
