justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
smith
against
the
city
of
jackson.
mr.
goldstein.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldstein,
let
me
just
interrupt
a
minute.
you
say
if
it
lacks
the...
the
business
justification.
but
is
it
not
a
part
of...
that
is
not
a
part
of
the
plaintiffs'
primary
submission,
is
it,
that
it
does
not
show?
that's
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
at
this
point
going
really
back
to
the
question
i
asked
you
at
the
outset
of
the
argument?
if
i
thought
seniority
or
years
of
service
was
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
and
if
i
thought
this
particular
compensation
program
was
based
on
years
of
service
rather
than
age,
can
i
look
at
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
in
deciding
whether
your
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
i
do
look
at
it
and
if
i
do
come
to
the
conclusion
i've
suggested,
would
i
not
have
to
dismiss
your
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
hypothetical...
and
i
think
it
may
be
the
case...
that
you
have
a
compensation
program
which
uses
years
of
service
as
a
basis
for
classifying
employees
which
has
a
disparate
impact
on
older
workers,
but
it
does...
also
it
relies
squarely
on
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
if
you
will
call
years
of
service
such
a
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
to
be
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
basis
for
differentiation
was
years
of
service,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just
asking
in
the
abstract.
why
wouldn't
that
always
be
a...
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
factor...
if
i
understand
it,
it
wasn't
because
they
were
line
officers,
it
was
rather
because
they
had
lesser
years
of
service
than
the
more
senior
officers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
the
statement
of
purpose
tells
me
what
the...
what
the
criterion
for
the
different
treatment
was.
i
still
think
it
was
years
of
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
criterion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
other
words,
the
criterion
was
the
kind
of
rank
they
had
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
say
the...
the
question
isn't
whether
they
used
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
your
question
is
whether
the
use
of
those
factors
was
overall
reasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
rewriting
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
title
vii
doesn't
have
this
language
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nager.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
that...
in
that
case,
we
were
construing
the
word
age
and
age
definitely
has
a
different
meaning
from
sex
or...
or
race.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nager,
i'm
lost.
what...
what
part
of
56a
are
you
referring
to?
(d)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
say
what
you
just
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nager,
at
the
end
of
his
report,
secretary
wirtz
said
the...
a
purpose,
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
the
employment
of
older
workers,
it
would
necessary
not
only
to
deal
with
overt
acts
of
discrimination,
but
also
to
adjust
those
present
employment
practices
which
quite
unintentionally
lead
to
age
limits
in
hiring.
and
your
point,
as
i
understand
it,
yes,
that
was
one
of
his
purposes,
but
he
meant
that
one
to
be
accomplished
with
erisa
and
other
things
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
quote...
the
reference
to
employment
practices
which
quite
unintentionally
lead
to
age
limits
in
hiring.
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
your
view,
is
based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
strictly
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
did
you
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
this
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
allege
that
the...
the
program
was
not
based
on...
was
based
on
factors
that
were
unreasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
trying
to
think
through
is
whether
that
issue
is
one
that
can
be
resolved
on
the
pleadings,
or
does
it
always
require
a
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
4
minutes,
and
let's
make
it
4
and
a
half.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
petitioners,
police
and
public
safety
officers
employed
by
the
city
of
jackson,
mississippi,
contend
that
salary
increases
received
in
1999
violated
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
of
1967,
which
we
refer
to
as
the
adea,
because
they
were
less
generous
to
officers
over
the
age
of
40
than
to
younger
officers.
their
suit
raises
the
question
whether
the
so-called
disparate
impact
theory
of
liability
that
we
have
recognized
in
cases
brought
in
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
is
also
cognizably
under
the
adea.
under
that
theory,
the
legality
of
a
discriminatory
practice
depends
on
its
effect
on
the
disfavored
employees
rather
than
the
intent
of
the
employer.
a
majority
of
the
court
has
concluded
that
the
adea
does
authorize
recovery
on
a
disparate
impact
theory.
the
opinion
that
i
have
authored,
which
is
joined
in
full
by
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer,
relies
primarily
on
the
text
of
the
statute
and
the
fact
that
we
have
interpreted
identical
statutory
language
in
title
vii
to
authorize
that
result.
justice
scalia
has
joined
all
but
part
three
of
our
opinion
and
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
that
endorses
our
reasoning
but
relies
primarily
on
the
so-called
chevron
deference
owed
to
the
views
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
which
is
joined
by
justice
kennedy
and
justice
thomas
expressing
the
view
that
the
disparate
impact
theory
is
categorically
unavailable
in
aeda
cases.
we
do,
however,
unanimously
agree
that
the
pay
plan
at
issue
in
this
case
represents
an
entirely
reasonable
attempt
to
bring
the
officers’
salaries
up
to
a
level
that
matches
those
in
surrounding
communities
in
order
to
meet
the
city’s
legitimate
goal
of
retaining
police
officers.
accordingly,
while
the
court
rejects
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
that
disparate
impact
theory
of
recovery
is
never
available
under
the
aeda.
we
affirm
its
judgment.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
