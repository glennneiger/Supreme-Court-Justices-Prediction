mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
go
straight
to
the
question
as
to
why
mere
statistical
correlations
with
age
don't
create
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
because
of
age.
this
court
in
its
title
vii
cases
has
said
that
a
mere
statistical
correlation
with
race
or
sex
can
create
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
because
of
race
or
sex
because
it's
advanced
a
proposition
that
there's
no
inherent
correlation
between
race
and
sex
and
ability
to
perform
a
job
or
do
a
job.
and
as
a
consequence,
the
court
has
said
that
a
statistical
disparity
is
a
departure
from
the
expected
norm.
thus,
the
statistical
disparity
creates
a
suspect
situation
which
could
be
treated
as
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
because
of
age,
to
use
the
court's
term
in
watson,
the
functional
equivalent
of
intentional
discrimination.
in
the
age
context,
the
premise
doesn't
apply.
in
the
age
context,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out
in
the
florida
power
argument,
as
he's
pointed
out
again
today,
age
is
inherently
correlated
with
myriad
selection
practices.
it's
painful
to
say,
particularly
to
a
court
that's
a
little
bit
older
than
i
am,
but
our
mental
and
physical
capacities
are
not
constant
over
our
lifetimes.
they're
different
for
each
one
of
us,
but
statistically
they
change
over
time
and
they
deteriorate
over
time,
and
progress
doesn't
treat
the
skills
and
abilities
that
we
have
with...
the
same
way
to
people
who
are
at
different
stages
in
life.
our
education
and
our
technological--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--there
is
no
doubt,
particularly
in
occupations
like
judging--
[laughter]
--that
experience
and
wisdom
may
be
something
that
grow
over
a
lifetime.
but
as
we
know--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
answer
to
that
is
as
follows,
is
that
justice...
chief...
then
justice
rehnquist,
now
chief
justice
rehnquist,
wrote
a
dissent
from
denial
at
the
time
of
geller
v.
markham.
and
in
my
practical
experience...
and
i
do
defend
these
cases
for
a
living...
that
put
a
tremendous
chill
on
the
plaintiffs
bar,
and
there
were
very
few
of
these
cases
brought.
but
contrary
to
mr.
goldstein,
who
doesn't
represent
employers
and
help
them
plan
their
selection
practices,
employers
made
huge
changes
in
the
'80's
and
the
early
'90's
until
this
court's
decision
in
hazen
paper
because
employers
were
scared
of
these
cases,
and
so
employers
started
managing
the
numbers.
there
were
a
lot
of
reductions
in
force
in
the
late
'80's,
as
i'm
sure
this
court
remembers,
as
our
nation
when
through
a...
a
industrial
restructuring.
and
every
one
of
those
reductions
in
force,
i
had
to
sit
down
with
my
clients
and
break
up
the
age
of
the
work
force
into
bands
and
see
how
people
were
going
to
be
affected
and
move
numbers.
and
the
irony,
of
course,
is...
is
in
doing
that,
employers
adversely
impact
the
very
people
who
are
benefitted
by
the
disparate
impact
doctrine
under
title
vii
because
the
age
discrimination
act
principally
favors
more
senior,
older
white
males,
and
when
you
try
to
manage
your
numbers
so
that
you
don't
adversely
impact
older
white
males,
what
happens
is...
is
you
adversely
impact
the
new
entrants
to
the
work
force
who
in
the
last
25
years
have
been
much
greater
numbers
of
racial
minorities
and
females.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
let
me
answer
that.
first
of
all,
the...
the
answer
is,
is
you
only
get
to
chevron
deference
if
this
statute
is
not
subject
to
construction
by
this
court
in
phase
one
of
chevron.
the
first
question
is
can
this
court,
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
other
legal
materials,
interpret
the
statute
to
have
a
single,
reasonably
clear
meaning.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
just
the
way
this
court
did
last
term
in
the
general
dynamics
case,
which
i
realize
you
dissented
on
this
point,
justice
scalia.
but
just
last
term
in
the
general
dynamics
case,
this
court
held
that
the
phrase,
because
of
age,
is
idiomatically
and
contextually
different
than
the
phrase,
because
of
race
or
sex.
and
my
point
to
justice
breyer
is...
is
that
the
phrase,
because
of
age,
cannot
properly
be
construed
to
be
satisfied
by
a
mere
statistical
correlation
with
age.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i'm
not
saying
that
the...
the
general
dynamics
case
disposes
of
this
case,
justice
stevens.
i'm
simply
pointing
out
that,
as
justice
souter's
opinion
for
the
court
last
term
held,
that
similar
language
in
similar
statutes
can
have
different
meaning
and
not
be
ambiguous.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
not
quite
right,
justice
ginsburg.
what
we're
saying
is...
is
that
natural
meaning
of
the
phrase,
because
of,
either
in
title
vii
or
in
the
age
act,
is
a
natural,
more
conventional
reference
to
intent.
nonetheless,
the
court,
because
of
the
objectives
of
title
vii
and
because
statistical
correlations
could
equal
a
functional
equivalent
of
intentional
discrimination,
construed
title
vii
to
go
beyond
intent-based
claims
to
encompass
disparate
impact
claims.
our
point
to
the
court
today
is...
is
that
neither
of
those
two
critical
premises
apply,
that
a
mere
correlation
with
age
does
not,
in
the
context
of
age,
equal
a
prima
facie
case
of--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
they
copied
it
before
griggs
was
decided,
indeed,
before
any
agency
of
government,
before
any
court
in
this
country,
and
before
any
academic
in
this
country
had
floated
the
concept--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i...
i
think
that
that's
wrong,
justice
scalia.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
let
me
answer
that
question
directly
and
then
come
back
and
argue
with
you
about
your
premise.
if
you
turn
to
the
appendix
and
on
the
red
brief,
page
56a
is
the
regulation.
and
it
is...
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
it
is
not
an
interpretation
of
the
prohibition
of
the
statute.
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
reasonable
factor
of
an
age
provision.
and
as
initial
point,
i'd
submit
to
you,
justice
scalia,
that
it's
one
thing
to
defer
to
an
agency's
interpretation
of
the
provision
that
you're
being
asked
to
construe
in
resolving
what
the
meaning
of
the
provision
you're
being
asked
to
construe
is.
it's
another
thing
to
defer
to
their
interpretation
of
a
distinct
provision
which
isn't
a
prohibition
at
all.
let
me
move
on
and
let's
read
what
it
says,
though.
what
it
says
is...
is
the
following.
it's
interpreting
a
phrase
that
says
is
based
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age,
which
mr.
goldstein
has
conceded
in
his
brief
and
the
petitioners
in
the
florida
power
case
also
conceded
is
necessarily
a
reference
to
intentionality.
but
there's
not
a
word
in
this
regulation
about
employer
intentions.
quite
the
contrary.
and
the
reason
why
i...
i
asked
you
to
turn
to
page
56a
of
our
brief
rather
than
the
quotation
of
the
regulation
in
mr.
goldstein's
brief
is
because
there's
an
additional
sentence
in
the
regulation
that
mr.
goldstein
didn't
print
in
his
brief,
and
that
is
that
the
eeoc
said
where
tests
are
involved--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--page
56a
of
the
red
brief.
i'm
sorry,
justice.
it's
section
(d).
mr.
glen
d.
nager
(d)
as
in
david.
what
the
eeoc
said
is
that
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
provision
is
not
an
intent-based
provision.
it's
a
business
necessity
provision.
they
did
it,
saying
it
means
the
same
thing
as
it's...
as
it
means
in
title
vii
because
their
whole
purpose
here
was
to
conform
the
age
act
to
title
vii,
and
they
said
you
have
to
comply,
where
tests
are
involved,
with
the
uniform
guidelines
on
employee
selection
that
they
jointly
promulgated
with
the
department
of
labor,
the
justice
department,
and
the
civil
service
branch,
whose
name
has
escaped
me
right
now.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
(d)
on
page
56a.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
glen
d.
nager
tests
which
are
asserted...
the
last
sentence.
tests
which
are
asserted
as
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
will
be
scrutinized
in
accordance
with
the
standards
set
forth
at
part
1607
of
this
title.
part
1607
of
this
title
is
the
uniform
guidelines
on
employee
selection.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
were
assuming
that
this
court's
decision
in
griggs...
because
this
is
what
they
said
in
their
comments...
this
court's
decision
in
griggs
required
disparate
impact
analysis--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it's...
it's
outside
the...
the
statutory
authority
for
two
reasons.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--mr.
goldstein
cited
a
bunch
of
eeoc
briefs
in
his
brief,
and
you'll
notice
he
didn't
quote
a
single
part
of...
of
those
eeoc
briefs
which
say
that
the
standard
under
the
age
act
is
less
than
the
standard
under
the
age
act.
what
he
cites
to
is
a
footnote
in
his
opening
brief
where
he
quotes
one
sentence
from
an
eeoc
brief
where
an
eeoc
appellate
lawyer
said
it
is...
is
likely
that
an
employer
will
be
able
to
prevail
more
often.
the
eeoc
never
said...
and...
and
i
litigate
against
them.
i
can
tell
you
the
only
thing
that
they
would
hate
less
but
hate
a
lot
than
your
ruling
in
our
favor
that
there's
no
disparate
impact
claims
at
all
is
that
mr.
goldstein
has
represented
what
their
version
of
the
defense
is
because
that's
not
the
government's
position.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
which
one--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--okay.
i...
i
would
submit
that
you
should--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i...
i
should...
i
would
submit,
justice
breyer,
that
you
should
reexamine
your
premise
that
the
language
of
the
age
act,
both
in
section
4(a)
by
itself
and
construed
in
light
of
4(f)
and
the
legislative
history
and
purposes
of
the
statute
encompass
disparate
impact
claims.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
oh,
i
think
that's--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
you
did,
although
i
don't
even
think,
frankly,
from
what
i've
read
is
they
made
the
judgment.
they
made
the
assumption.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
great
question
and
the
answer
is
no,
they
can't.
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
reason
is...
is
because
if
you...
if
you
lower
the
prima
facie
case
so
that
it's
meaningless,
so
that
it
means
that
all
a
plaintiff
has
to
do
is
find
a
selection
practice...
because
it's
always
going
to
correlate
with
age...
it
means
you
shifted
the
burden
to
an
employer
in
every
case
to
establish
that
its...
its
practice
meets
whatever
standard
your
hypothesizing
the
eeoc
might
come
up
with
later,
justice
breyer.
meanwhile,
the
world
has
to
go
on,
and
what
my
clients
will
do
is
as
follows.
they
will
say,
well,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
wait
to
see
if...
if
this
new
practice
we're
going
to
consider
is
going
to
stand
the
test
of
time
in
court
and
under
the
eeoc's
yet-to-be-articulated
regulation.
we're
going
to
stick
with
the
tried
and
true.
we
are
not
going
to
innovate
at
all,
and
if
we're
going
to
innovate,
we're
going
to
massage
the
numbers
while
we
do
it.
the
employers--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
as--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i...
i
don't
want
to
resist
the
easy
burden,
but
i
do
want
to
tell
you,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
the
florida
power
argument,
my
clients
do
think
about
these
things
because
if...
you
know,
if
they
adopt
an
unreasonable
practice
that
has
an
adverse
statistical
effect
and
they
think
they're
likely
to
get
sued
about
it,
they
actually
do
have
to
worry
about
it
because
these
cases
are
tried
to
juries
and
they
have
to
have
a
reasonable
explanation
for
what...
their
practice
because
they
get
tried
to
juries
as
disparate
treatment
cases.
our
point
is
not
that
statistics
are
not
admissible.
they
are.
our
point
is...
is
that
they're
not
sufficient
by
themselves
to
create
a
prima
facie
case
of...
because
of
age,
as
it
would
be
in
a
title
vii
case
where
we
wouldn't
expect
to
see
the
statistical
disparity.
so
it's
fair
to
say
that
there's
a
reasonable
adverse
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
existence
of
the
disparity
itself.
that
is
the
premise
articulated
by
this
court
as
to
why
the
disparate
impact
doctrine
can...
can
at...
the
prima
facie
case
aspect
of
it
equals
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
because
of
race
or
sex.
that
is
not
true
here.
now,
it
is
also
the
case
that
when
this
court
adopted
the
disparate
impact
doctrine,
it
said
it
placed
an
enormous
weight
on
the
objectives
of
title
vii's
prohibitions,
which
it
construed
to
be,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
eliminating
these
built-in
headwinds.
well,
when...
when
the
secretary
of
labor
proposed
the
age
discrimination
act,
he
gave
a
report
to
congress
and
he
said
age
discrimination
is
different
than
race
and
sex
discrimination.
it
is
not
based
on
animus.
it
is...
it
is
not
dealing
with
a
group
of
individuals
who
have
suffered
cumulative
disabilities
over
their
lifetime
because
of
historic
discrimination.
he
said
it's...
the
problem
of
age
discrimination
is
the
problem
of
over-generalization
by
an
employer.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
but
his
solution
was
not
a
disparate
impact
doctrine.
his
solution
was--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
take
a
look
at
the
statute,
justice
ginsburg.
please
look
at
page
15a
and
16a
in
the
red
brief.
and
if
you
look
at
section
621(b)...
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
15a
of
the
red
brief...
congress
said
what
the
purposes
of
the
age
discrimination
act
were,
and
it
had
three,
but
it's
only
addressed
one
with
a
prohibition.
the
second
one
was
to
prohibit
arbitrary
age
discrimination
in
employment.
the
other
two
were
to
promote
employment
of
older
persons
based
on
ability
and
to
help
employers
and
workers
find
ways
of
meeting
problems
arising
from
the
impact
of
age
on
employment.
and
if
you
turn
the
page
and
look
at
section
622(a)(1),
the
very
first
thing
congress
mandates
that
the
secretary
shall
do
to
address
its
other
two
purposes,
to
undertake
research
and
promote
research
with
a
view
to
reducing
barriers
to
the
employment
of
older
persons
and
the
promotion
of
measures
for
using
their
skills.
what
the
secretary
of
labor's
report
goes
on
at
length
about
is
it
identified
all
kinds
of
factors,
neutral
and
non-neutral--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it
does...
what
it...
you're
right
it
doesn't
say
the
following.
it
doesn't
say,
and
we
don't
want
disparate
impact,
because
in
1967
the...
the
concept
of
disparate
impact
as
a
legal
theory
was
unknown
to
congress,
to
the
courts,
and
to
the
administrative
agencies.
but
what
the
secretary
of
labor
did
do
in
his
report
is,
after
identifying
all
of
the
problems
that
adversely
affect
older
workers,
he
says,
i
recommend
a
two-pronged
approach.
one
prong
is
prohibitory.
it's
coercive.
you
shall
not...
we'll
prohibit
arbitrary
age
discrimination
in
employment,
which
the
secretary
explained
to
congress,
and
this
court
last
term
said
itself,
means
a...
is
a...
is...
is
the
use
of
age
as
the
decision-making
criteria.
he
said,
separately
we
should
have
a
series
of
programs
that
seek
to
enlarge
the
abilities
of
older
workers,
that
seek
to
educate
employers
about
the
abilities
of
older
workers
through
non-coercive
programs.
and
so
what
this
statute
does...
and
this
court
has
said
it
in
several
of
its
cases...
this
statute
was
based
upon
the
secretary
of
labor's
report.
the
secretary
wrote
the
bill,
and
although
congress
amended
it
in
other
ways,
it
didn't
amend
any
of
these
provisions.
that
this
statute
took
a
more
nuanced
approach
to
deal
with
a
distinctly
different
problem,
and
the
problem--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
the
quote
that
you
just
gave
says
that
there
are
express
uses
of
age
and
there
are
non-age
reasons
that
lead
to
the
use
of
express
limits
of
age,
for
example,
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
gave
with
mr.
goldstein,
saying,
well,
i
wouldn't
want
to
hire
someone
who's
going...
who
tells
me
they're
going
to
retire
a
year
from
now.
but
if
he
said
i'm
not
going
to
hire
you
because
you're
64
because
i
know
you're
going
to...
people
retire
at
65
mostly,
that
would
be
the
same
kind
of
non-age-based
motive
that
nevertheless
used
age
as
a
decision-making
criteria.
that's
what
that
quote
is
referring
to.
if
you...
if
you...
the
second
half--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--right.
and
then...
and...
and
the
point
here
is
this
was
thought
out.
it
wasn't
thought
out
as
disparate
treatment
versus
disparate
impact
because
the
concepts
didn't
exist
at
the
time,
but
it
was
thought
out
as
arbitrary
age
discrimination
versus
other
factors
that
adversely
bear
on
older
workers.
the
prohibitions
went
to
arbitrary
age
discrimination
and
didn't
go
to
the
adverse
impacts.
it
was
the...
the
non-coercive
measures
that
went
to
the
adverse
impacts.
let
me
go
also--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--two
points?
mr.
glen
d.
nager
one
is...
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
we
love
the
language.
we
don't
have
to
get
out
of
it.
it
says
because
of
age.
that's
a
reference,
a
traditional,
conventional
reference--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
the
first...
before
the
comma
is
the
statement
both
of
the
action
of
the
employer
and
the
injury
that
it
has
to
cause
in
order
for
a
claim
to
exist,
and
then
there's
another
requirement.
the
requirement
is...
is
that
the
action
and
the...
the
effect
of...
the
injury
that's
affected
by
it
be...
because
of
age.
that
is
a
conventional
reference
to
intent.
and
the
confirmation
that
it's
a
reference--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it...
it...
the
phrase,
because
of
age,
modifies
all
of
the
words
that
precede
the
comma
that
separates
the
two.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
i...
i
think
it
does
modify
the
verb,
but--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
i...
i
think
that's
the
grammatically
correct
way
to
read
it.
but
even...
even
if
it
was
just
modifying
the
adversely
affect--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it
would
still
be
because
of
age.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
one
still--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--you...
even
if
you
read
it
that
way,
it
still
says,
comma,
because
of
age,
and
the
because
of
age
is
a
reference
to
intent,
and
the
confirmation
of
that,
justice
breyer,
is
the
defense
that
you
keep
pointing
to
because
as
mr.
goldstein
conceded
in
his
brief
and
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
questioning,
it
says,
is
based
on.
that
is
also
a
reference
to
intent.
this
statute
is
preoccupied
with
intent.
what
section
4(f)
was
about
was
identifying
the
situations
in
which
age
would
be
used
but
it,
nonetheless,
wouldn't
even
be
arbitrary--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
had
never
thought
of
construing
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
if...
if
he
did,
he's
only
strengthened
our
case.
what
i
want
to
say
to
the
court
is...
is
that
both
of
those
provisions
are
modified
by
the
phrase,
because
of
age.
this
court
in
hazen
paper
construed
the
because
of
language
in
4(a)(1)
as
a
reference
to
intent
and
said
statistical
correlations
of
age
are
not
sufficient
to
establish
because
of
age
within
the
meaning
of
section
4(a)(1).
and
the
presumption
of
uniform
usage...
we're
entitled
to
point
to
it
as
well
that
the
presumption
of
uniform
usage
which
would
be
that
the
phrase,
because
of
age,
in
section
4(a)(2)
is
also
not
satisfied
by
a
mere
statistical
correlation
with
age.
and
the
reason
why
title
vii
is
different
than
the
age
act...
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
because
this
is
so
critical,
justice
breyer...
is
that
the
premise
of
the
court's
statistical
cases
under
title
vii
is
that
it's...
it
presumes
that
there's
no
inherent
difference
in
ability
between
the
races
and
the
genders,
whereas
you
know
and
i
know
that
there
is
a
difference
in
an...
an
inherent
correlation
between
abilities
and
skills,
between
people
of
different
ages
statistically.
and
so
that
whereas
in
the...
in
the
race
and
sex
context,
a
statistical
disparity
by
itself
points
out
that
there's
something
suspect
and
so
would
justify
putting
the
employer
to
the
burden
on
those
occasions
which
would
happen.
and
by
definition,
i
think
you
and
i
both
think,
justice
breyer,
that
it's
not
all
that
often
that
you're
going
to
have
these
statistical
disparities
in
the
race
and
sex
context.
in
the
age
context,
they
happen
all
the
time.
so
it's...
it...
there's
no
basis
for
suggesting
that
a
statistical
correlation
by
itself
creates
something
suspect,
and
it
would
rob
the
notion
of
a
prima
facie
case
of
any
meaning
to
say
that...
that
a
statistical
correlation
with
age,
which
we
expect
to
see
all
the
time,
would
establish
a
prima
facie
wrong.
and,
of
course,
the
secretary
of
labor
wrote
a
report
telling
congress
that
race
and
sex
were
different
than
age
for
this
very
reason.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i...
i
think
that
it
is...
it
was
intended
to
address
mixed
motive
cases.
that's
why
it
was
added.
i
think
it
is
a
indicia
of
the
fact
that
this
statute
is
concerned
with
intent
in
its
prohibitions
only.
i'm
not
saying
it's
conclusive
of
that,
but
i'm
saying
it's
another
indicia,
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
section
4(f),
it's
about
the
instances
in
which
age
is
being
used--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i...
i
don't
think
that
it
is,
and
i...
i--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i...
i
didn't
handle
the
case
in
the
trial
court,
but
i
believe
that
the...
our...
our
client
denied
all
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
affirmatively
said
this
was...
its
salary
program
was
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age,
yes.
and
certainly
in
the
courts
below,
the
reasonable--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--well,
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
provision,
when
read
in
conjunction
with
section
(a)(4)...
4(a)
shows
that
this
is
an
intent-based
statute,
as
a
pure
legal
question,
can
be
judged
on
the
pleadings.
the...
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a...
in
a
particular
fact
situation
something
is
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
or
not
i
think
would
be
subject
to
what
the
proof
is.
it
might
be
undisputed.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
was
added
in
as
a
safe
harbor
to
address
mixed
motive
cases.
there
was
a
concern
at
the
time
that
since
employers
had
been
using
age
as
the
decision-making
factor,
that
they
would
continue
to
think
about
it,
and
the
question
was
raised,
well,
would
that
mean
that
the
very
fact
they
thought
of
it,
even
though
they
had
a
nondiscriminatory
reason,
mean
that
they
still
violated
the
act?
and
the
secretary
said,
no,
we've
put
in
this
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
provision
to
make
it
clear.
it...
it
was
simply
a
safe
harbor.
