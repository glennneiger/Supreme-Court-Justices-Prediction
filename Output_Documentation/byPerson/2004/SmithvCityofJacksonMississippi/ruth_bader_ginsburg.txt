mr.
goldstein,
before
you
do
that,
before
you
deal
with
the
eeoc
regulation,
this
statute
doesn't...
at
least
on...
on
the
page
1
part
you
called
our
attention
to,
doesn't
refer
to
business
necessity.
that's
in
the
eeoc
regulation.
if
i
were
just
reading
this
statute
cold,
i'd
say,
yes,
that
looks
like
an
affirmative
defense
to
me,
but
reasonable
factor
seems
like
something
quite
different
than
necessity.
it
isn't
necessary
for
the
business
to
do
this,
but
it's
reasonable.
and
if
that's...
then
the
business
necessity...
it
seems
to
me,
at
least
arguably,
an
improper
construction
of
this
act,
that
the
eeoc
got
it
wrong
when
it
referred
to
business
necessity.
they
were
thinking
of
griggs
and...
and
title
vii,
but
this
statute
says
reasonable
factors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
not
sure
you're
right
about
that,
mr.
goldstein,
because
if
you
think
of
what
it
was,
it
was
a
pen
and
paper
test
and
it
was
a
high
school
diploma.
now,
an
employer
might
well
think
i
want
to
upgrade
my
work
force.
i
want
this
to
be
a
real
classy
work
force.
so
i'm
going
to
require
a
high
school
diploma.
it
isn't
necessary,
but
why
is
it
unreasonable
for
me
to
do
that?
so
i...
i
don't...
i
think
griggs
spoke
about
rules
that
were
built
in
headwinds
because
a
large
part
of
the
population
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
get
high
school
diplomas.
that
doesn't
exist
in
the
age
discrimination
area.
so
i...
i
don't
think
that
griggs
is
an
example
of
something
that
was
a
loose
business
necessity
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
haven't
been
a
whole
lot
of
cases
under
the
impact
theory
as
applied
to
age,
and
you
just
said
you're
not
talking
about
the
cost
category
but
that...
you
mentioned
physical
fitness.
and
there
was
a
case.
smith
against
des
moines
involved
that,
but
it
was
found
the...
the
physical
fitness
test
was
job-related.
have
there
been
mutual
rules
with
a
disparate
impact
that
you
can
give
us
as
examples?
when
you're
talking
about
race
and
sex,
the
examples
come
to
mind
much
more
readily
than
in
the
age
category.

justice

no.
34.
justice
ruth
bader

yes,
but
not
whole
texts,
not...
i
don't
remember
whether
it
was
1...
1
and
2
or
a
and
b,
but
this
is
not
a
word,
age.
it's...
it's
lines
and
lines,
and
to...
and
to
say,
oh,
in
griggs
we
held
that
the
title
vii
language...
this
language
means
you
can
have
a
disparate
impact
theory,
but
in
age,
we're
going
to
read
those
very
same
words
to
prohibit.
in
one
sense...
one
you
read
to
say,
these
words
permit
disparate
impact,
and
then
you
read
the
same
words
to
say
these
words
prohibit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--disparate
impact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
gave
the
very
same
example
that
was
griggs.
he
gave
the
example
of
the
high
school
diploma
because
he
thought
that
people
of
a
certain
age,
when
there
wasn't
such
general
education
as
there
is
today,
might
not
have
a
high
school
diploma
to
a
much
higher
extent
than
the
people
who
came...
the
generation
who
came
after.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
a
little,
and
you
said
his
solution
was
we're
going
to
have
training
and
manuals
and
all.
but
that's
not
altogether
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
doesn't
say
there
that
that
is
to
implement
the
first...
that...
that
only
the
second
one,
to
prohibit
arbitrary
age
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
your
reading,
i
just
don't
see
that
there's
any
function.
i
mean,
if
disparate
impact
is
out
of
it,
then...
then
what
work
is
there
for
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
to
do?
