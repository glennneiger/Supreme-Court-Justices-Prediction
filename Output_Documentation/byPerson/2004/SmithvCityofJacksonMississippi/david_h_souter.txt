let
me...
let
me
ask
this.
if...
if
your
argument
has
force,
why
haven't
we
been
having
horrible
example
piled
upon
horrible
example
since
1981
when
the
eeoc
took
the
position
that
it
takes?
justice

mr.
nager,
will
you
go
to
another
one
of
justice
breyer's
premises?
he
says
following
the
practicalities
are
with
you,
which
you're
certainly
going
to
accept.
he
says
i
think
the
eeoc
can
deal
with
some
of
these
practical
problems.
do
you
think
so?
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
give
me
some
examples.
