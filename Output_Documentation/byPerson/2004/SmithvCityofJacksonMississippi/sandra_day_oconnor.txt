well,
maybe
you
should
because
i'm
not
so
sure
that
the
eeoc
interpretation
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
was
this
an
actual
rule
after
notice
and
comment,
or
is
it
a...
an
interpretation?
justice
sandra

mr.
goldstein,
you...
this
is...
this
case
arises
out
of
a
compensation
program
of
the
employer,
and
why
is
it
brought
under
4(a)(2)
instead
of
4(a)(1)
which
addresses
discrimination
in
compensation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
in
light
of
4(a)(1)?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
once
we...
if
we
were
to
say
it's
covered,
don't
you
think
that
number
would
expand?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
is
it
an
affirmative
defense?
