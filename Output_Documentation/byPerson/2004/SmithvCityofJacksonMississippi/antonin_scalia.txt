scalia
you
don't
care
about
those
regs
anyway.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
do.
i
thought
you
were
saying
you
could
make
your
case
just
on
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--text
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
examples
of?
violations
or
things
that
are
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
that
i
don't
want
to
hire
somebody
who's
going
to
retire
a
year
after
i
hire
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
that
seems
to
me
terribly
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
how
old
he
is.
i
don't
want
anybody
who's
going
to
retire
the
year
after
i
hire
him.
i
don't
want
to
have
to
go
through
this...
this
whole
process
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
wunsler
died
at
about
28,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
do
about
the
eeoc's
regulation?
why
isn't
that...
why
isn't
that
entitled
to
chevron
deference?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
we
possibly
say
that
it's
not
ambiguous
when
we
have,
in
another
context,
interpreted
the
identical
language
to
permit--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
that's
so,
congress
shouldn't
have
copied
the
language
of
title
vii.
it
isn't
a
matter
of
it
just
accidentally
comes
out
to...
to
be
sounding
the
same,
as
though,
you
know,
two
monkeys
did
it
on
a
typewriter
or
something.
they
copied...
they
copied
title
vii.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it's
a
fair
conclusion
that
they
meant
the
two
to
mean
the
same
thing,
whether
it
was
before
griggs
or
after
griggs.
they
copied
the
language.
it
seems
to
me
they
wanted
the
two
to
mean
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
or...
or
at
least
it
is
arguably
so,
in
which
case
you
come
back
to
my
question.
why
isn't
the...
the
eeoc's
resolution
of
that
ambiguity
conclusive?
justice
antonin
scalia
where...
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
(e)?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
eeoc
regulation
was
not
so
much
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
as
an
interpretation
of
griggs.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
maybe
this
provision
represents
the
judgment
of
the
agency
that
griggs
applies
to
this
other
statute,
and...
and
i'm
not
sure
that
we
owe
chevron
deference
to
that
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
segregate
or
classify.
you
want
to
read
it
all
the
way
up
back
to
segregate
or
classify.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
good
if
you
had
a
comma
after
employees.
i...
i
might
go
along
with
you
if
there
was
a
comma
after...
to
limit,
segregate,
or
classify
his
employees,
comma,
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
or
tend
to
deprive
any
individual
of
opportunities
or
otherwise
affect
his
status
as
an
employee,
comma,
because
of
such
individual's
age...
go
way
back
to
before
the
comma.
i
can
see
that,
but
without
the
comma,
that's...
that's
an
awful
travel
back
to
limit,
segregate,
or
classify.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
and
i
guess
what
supports
that
reading
is
that
intent...
intent
to
discriminate
in
hiring...
the
intentional
discrimination
because
of
age
in
hiring
is
covered
by
(2)
rather
than
(1)
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think...
i
mean,
if...
if
you
have
a
rule...
if
you
have
a
rule
that
you
won't
hire
any
employee...
i
mean,
we...
we
were
talking
earlier
about
the...
the
reason...
(2)
reads
employees
in
the
plural,
and
(1)
reads
refuse
to
hire
or
discharge
any
individual.
so
if
you
have
any
intentional
discrimination
that
is
against
a
class,
it
comes
under
(2)
rather
than
(1).
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
wrong?
well,
i
thought...
i
thought
that's
what...
what
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
telling
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
of
dual
motive?
