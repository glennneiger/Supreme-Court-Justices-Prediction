justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you...
do
you
agree
that
all
the
papers
showing
the
arrest
and
the
investigation
and
so
forth
show
that
this
was
in
fact
a
building--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
was
burglarized?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
show
it
was
a
vehicle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
boat?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
motorcycle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
shows
nothing?
none
of
the
supporting
documentation
shows
what
it
was?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
my
question.
i
asked
you
whether
any
of
them
show
that
it
was,
in
fact,
a
building
or
a
car
or
a
boat.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
rule
you
would
have
us
follow
does
result
in
a...
a
super
technicality
in
a
sense
of
what...
what
was
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe,
maybe
not.
that's
kind
of
the
question
we
have,
how...
what
gloss
to
put
on
taylor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
join
the
amici
in
saying
almendarez-torres
has
to
be
overruled?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
so
we're
looking--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there's
no
record
here
of
the
colloquy
at
the
plea?
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
would
be
content
with
just
relying
on
whatever
was
disclosed
at
the
plea
colloquy
in
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
would
take...
you
would
make
the
assumption,
apparently,
that
on
that
occasion
the
elements,
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea
would
have
been
disclosed.
but
unfortunately,
the
record
has
been
destroyed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
can
just
presume
that
the
proceeding
was
regular
and
it
was
disclosed.
is
that
right?
is...
under
massachusetts
law
is
there
any
difference
in
the
penalty
at
all
for
burglary
of
a
house
versus
a
motorcycle
versus
a
car
versus
a
vessel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
should
we
interpret
taylor?
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
the
interpretation
suggested
this
morning
by
justice
breyer,
for
example?
