justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what...
is...
is
your
argument
that
we
are
likely,
in
effect,
to...
to
violate
some
constitutional
standard
if
we
do
what
the
government
wants,
or
is
your
argument
as
follows?
that
taylor
says
this
is
an
offense-based
not
a
fact-based
determination.
taylor
says
that's
what
the
statute
is
getting
at.
and
if
you
go
as
far
as
the
government
wants
here,
you
basically
will
have
gone
beyond
offense-based.
you
will
have
gone...
become
fact-based
and
you
will
be
violating
the
statute.
so
my
question
is,
is
there
something
constitutionally
we
have
to
worry
about
which
is
the
basis
for
your
argument,
or
is
it
a
violation
of
the
statute
that
you
think
we
ought
to
be
worried
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
have
a
position.
i
can't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
aren't
we
asking
that
question
in...
in
any
case?
the
question
ultimately
is,
what
did
he
mean
when
he
said
i
am
guilty?
if
you've
got
a
plea
colloquy,
as
you
admitted
a
moment
ago,
it's
easy
to
find
out
what
he
meant
because
they
would
have
gone
into
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
if
there's
a
written
plea
agreement,
it's
probably
going
to
be
easy
to
find
out
because,
again,
there
would
be
a
basis
for
the
plea
set
out.
here,
there
isn't
one
of
those
documents.
so
you're
going
one
step
further,
but
you're
still
asking
the
question
what
did
he
mean
when
he
stood
in
that
courtroom
and
said
i
am
guilty.
and
yes,
in...
in
one
sense
that's
fact-based,
but
all
of
those
questions
are
fact-based.
they're
going
to
the
same
issue.
what
did
he
mean?
what
was
pleading
guilty
to?
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
can't
you
make
the
determination?
isn't
the...
the
problem
that
your
determination
may
not
be
as
reliable?
and
i
thought
ultimately
your
argument
would
boil
down
to
saying
this.
the
reason
you
will
accept
the
plea
colloquy
or
the
plea
agreement,
if
it
sets
out
the
facts,
is
that
that
is
very
reliable.
it
is
a
reliable
indication
of
what
he
was
pleading
guilty
to
and
what
the
court
was
finding
him
guilty
of.
but
once
you
go
beyond
that
and
you
start
looking
into
police
reports
appended
to
complaints
or
whatnot,
you're
getting
into
an
area
of
less
reliability,
and
when
we're
dealing
with
sentence
enhancements
like
this,
we
better
be
reliable.
that's
why
the
statute
based
it
on...
on
offense
rather
than
facts.
don't
get
into
a
factual
determination
that
is
unreliable.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument
ultimately.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i'll
accept
that,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
is
a
categorical
determination
important?
i
threw
you
a...
a
bone
a
second
ago,
and
i
said
maybe
it's
because
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--a
reliability
concern.
is
that
it?
is
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is...
is
your
point
that
once
you
get
beyond
the
documents
that
you
admit
we
can
look
at,
there
is
a
higher...
an...
an
unacceptably
high
risk
of
unreliability?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that...
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow
from...
from
looking
at
a
police
report.
it
may
well
be
that
we
would
say
the
burden
never
shifts,
and
he
is
simply
in
the
position
of
any
other
party
to
a
case.
if...
if
the
other
side
has
put
in
evidence
that
is...
is
against
his
interest
and
he
does
nothing,
then
he's
in
trouble.
but
that
isn't
the
same
as
shifting
the
burden.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no...
i
guess
all
i'm
saying
is
it
doesn't
follow
from
the
argument
that
the
government
is
making
that
a
burden
of
persuasion
shifts.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
government--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
the
warrant
affidavit
is
going
to
be
present
in
the
files.
it's...
it's
returned.
it's...
it's
normally
filed
with...
with
the
other
papers
in
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
not?
i...
i
mean,
are
we
going
to
imagine
an
entirely
different
case
out
of
the
blue
from
the
one
that's
disclosed
in...
in
the
warrant
application?
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
a...
a
relatively
high
degree
of
probability
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
say
the
warrant
application
says,
you
know,
we're
looking
for
a
stolen
radio
and
the
charge
does
indicate
that
he
was...
that...
that
the...
that
the
property
taken
in
the
burglary
was
a...
was...
was
a
radio.
wouldn't
that
be
a
basis
for
saying,
okay,
the
warrant
application
probably
discloses
what
was
going
on
here?
if...
if
the...
if
it
was
a
radio
on
the
warrant
application,
a
radio
in
the
burglary
charge
to
which
he
did
plead
guilty,
probably
it's
the
radio
at
the
address
indicated
in
the
warrant
application.
isn't
that
a
fair
inference?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
done
in
advance
by...
you
know,
by...
by
a
couple
of
hours
from
the...
the
police
going
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what...
what
about
the...
the
police
officer...
what...
what
if
we
don't
have
a
document
of
any
sort
but
the...
the
state
calls
the
police
officer
who,
in
fact,
made
the
application
for
the...
the
issuance
of
the
complaint
and
he
says,
when
i
appeared
to
ask
for
the
issuance
of
the
complaint,
i
testified
to,
i
swore
to
the
following
facts?
i.e.,
that
it
was
a
house
at
such
and
such
shaw
street.
that
gives
you
your
contemporaneity
element.
why
not
accept
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
have
notes.
but
the
police
all
have
little
notebooks.
that's
what
they
use
in
trial
day
in
and
day
out.
so
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
if...
if
contemporaneity
is
the...
is...
is...
or
rough
contemporaneity
is...
is
the
criterion,
then
on
your
theory
we
ought
to
get
into
testimonial
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
armed
career
criminal
act
provides
that
anyone
convicted
of
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
who
has
three
prior
convictions
for
violent
crimes
must
be
sentenced
to
at
least
15
years
in
prison.
the
statute
defines
violent
crime
who
include
burglary.
in
a
1990
case,
taylor
against
the
united
states,
we
interpreted
the
law's
use
of
burglary
to
cover
only
what
we
then
called
generic
burglary,
by
which
we
basically
meant
a
burglary
that
involved
entry
into
a
building
rather
than
a
car
or
a
boat
or
whatnot.
in
taylor,
the
defendant's
prior
burglary
conviction
had
occurred
in
a
state
with
a
statute
providing
that
burglary
included
entries
into
boats
and
railroad
cars
as
well
as
into
buildings.
the
state
statute,
in
other
words,
criminalized
both
non-generic
and
generic
burglary.
how
then
was
the
a
sentencing
someone
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
supposed
to
tell
whether
a
burglary
conviction
in
a
state
like
that
was
the
generic
burglary
which
counted
under
the
act
or
non-generic
burglary
which
did
not
count?
we
said
that
a
conviction
under
a
state
statute
that
criminalizes
both
generic
and
non-generic
burglary
accounts
for
the
15-year
minimum
under
the
act
if
the
charging
document
and
the
jury
instructions
from
the
earlier
trial
show
that
the
jury
necessarily
had
to
find
a
generic
burglary
in
order
to
convict
the
defendant.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
reginald
shepard,
pleaded
guilty
in
federal
court
to
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
the
government
argued
its
sentencing
that
shepard
had
at
least
three
burglary
convictions
that
counted
against
him
under
the
act
and
so
had
to
receive
the
15-year
mandatory
minimum.
the
district
court
said
no,
however,
noting
that
each
of
the
prior
burglary
convictions
occurred
in
massachusetts,
the
state
with
a
non-generic
burglary
statute
and
each
followed
a
guilty
plea
rather
than
a
trial.
the
charging
document
in
each
case
did
not
limit
the
charge
to
generic
burglary
and
because
there
was
no
trial,
there
were
no
jury
instructions
that
showed
shepard's
conviction
was
necessarily
for
generic
burglary.
although
the
government
contended
that
the
police
reports
and
complaint
applications
from
those
prior
convictions
showed
that
each
one
involved
entry
into
a
building
and
thus
was
a
generic
burglary.
the
district
court
concluded
that
taylor
did
not
permit
her
to
examine
such
documents.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
review
of
the
police
reports
and
complaint
applications.
the
district
court
conducted
the
review
and
again
declined
to
impose
the
sentence
concluding
that
the
documents
did
not
provide
the
necessary
assurance
that
shepard
had
pleaded
guilty
to
three
generic
burglaries.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
again
and
ordered
the
imposition
of
the
15-year
minimum.
we
granted
certiorati
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
although
taylor
involved
prior
burglary
convictions
obtained
after
jury
trials
rather
than
guilty
pleas,
the
armed
career
criminal
act
gives
no
indication
that
the
two
types
of
prior
convictions
should
be
treated
differently
and
the
reasoning
of
taylor
itself
is
not
limited
to
prior
jury
convictions.
in
the
context
of
prior
jury
convictions,
taylor,
as
mentioned,
allows
sentencing
courts
to
examine
the
indictment
and
the
jury
instructions.
taylor
referred
to
indictments
and
in
jury
instructions
for
a
specific
reason,
namely,
that
they
can
show
that
the
jury
necessarily
had
to
find
a
generic
burglary
in
order
to
convict.
in
the
context
of
prior
of
guilty
pleas,
we
conclude
that
the
need
to
show
that
a
conviction
was
necessarily
for
generic
burglary
limits
courts
to
examining,
in
addition
to
the
charging
documents,
the
written
plea
agreement,
the
transcript
of
the
plea
colloquy
and
any
explicit
factual
findings
by
the
trial
court
to
which
the
defendant
assented.
police
reports
and
complaint
applications
cannot
show
that
a
later
guilty
plea
was
necessarily
to
generic
burglary.
the
government
urges
us
to
allow
a
more
wide-ranging
inquiry,
but
its
arguments
in
favor
of
such
an
approach
are
inconsistent
with
taylor
and
thus
amount
to
a
call
to
move
away
from
that
decision.
since
taylor
was
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
usual
demands
of
sticking
to
precedent
are
very
strong.
we
also
believe
that
relaxing
the
standard
as
the
government
asks
us
to
do
would
take
trial
judges
dangerously
close
to
fact
finding
of
a
sort
that
a
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
insist
that
a
jury
make.
justice
thomas
joins

but
part
three
of
the
opinion
and
he
has
filed
and
opinion
concurring
in

conruccing
in

judgment;
justice
o'connor
has
filed

in
which
justices

and
breyer
join.
the
chief
justice
took
no

in
the
decision
of
this
case.
