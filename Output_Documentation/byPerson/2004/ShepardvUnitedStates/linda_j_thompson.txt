ms.
linda
j.
thompson
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
proper
application
of
the
categorical
method
of
analysis
that
this
court
prescribed
in
taylor
against
united
states,
and
it
involves
the
application
of
that
categorical
method
to
what
is
described
as
ambiguous
burglary
convictions
obtained
under
nongeneric
burglary
statutes
with
boiler
plate
complaints
and
a
general
finding
of
guilty
following
a
plea
proceeding.
at
stake--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--in
this
case--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--well,
a
generic
burglary
statute,
as...
as
defined
in
the
taylor
case
is
one
that
criminalizes
unlawful
entry
into
a
building
or
a
structure
with
intent
to
commit
another
crime.
those
are
the
three
elements
of
generic
burglary.
those
apply
if
any...
if
a
state
statute
covers
those
three,
it's
considered
generic
burglary
and
would
then
qualify
as
a
predicate
violent
felony
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
a
nongeneric--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--no.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
i
do
not.
i...
as
this--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--it
doesn't
show
that
it
was
a
vehicle.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
it
doesn't
show
that
it
was
a
boat.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
it
doesn't
show
that
it
was
a
motorcycle.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
those
supporting
documents
do
not
play
a
role
in
the
adjudication.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
none
of
them
shows
that
it
was
anything
other
than
a
building.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
the
police
reports
and
the
complaint
applications,
but
the
statute--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--there
is
no
question
of
that.
when
you
look
at
the
police
reports,
if
you
read
those
police
reports,
some
of
which
you
can
actually
read,
they
do
describe
buildings
and
they
describe
addresses
and
hallways
and
things
like
that.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
that's...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
actually
the
district
court
established
that
this
was
not
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
the
district
court
took
evidence
on
this
issue.
the
statutes
to...
that
are
underlying
these
convictions,
to
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
are
nongeneric,
and
they
are
nongeneric
in
the
sense
that
they
make
it
unlawful
to
break
into
structures
other
than
buildings
or
in
addition
to
buildings.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
that
calls
into
question
what
kinds
of
documents
can
be
examined
in
terms
of
making
a...
a
determination
as
to
whether
this
offense
was
categorically
a
crime
of
violence,
that
is,
that
it
was
generic
burglary.
it's
our
position
that
there's
a
limitation,
and
the
limitation
is
imposed
by
taylor
itself,
that
the
question
being
answered
be
made
a
question
of
law,
that
it
is
a
question
of
law,
that
it's
a
matter
of
law
that
you
make
the
determination.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
if
we
had
a
contemporaneous
record
of
the
adjudication
of
this
conviction
that
showed
an
actual
admission
to
breaking
into
a
building,
i
believe
that
that
would
satisfy
a
sort
of
modified
taylor
categorical
approach.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
the--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--the
example
that's
given,
the
charging
document
and
jury
instructions...
let's
suppose
that
instead
of...
of
guilty
pleas,
mr.
shepard
was
tried
and
he
was
tried
on
this
nongeneric,
boiler
plate
complaint,
and
there
were
no
jury
instructions
available.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
the
district
court
did
actually
entertain
this
issue,
justice
breyer,
and
what
they...
what
the
district
court
found
was
there
wasn't
an
opportunity,
there
wasn't
a
reason
for
mr.
shepard
to
contest
building
or
any
other
element
of
this
offense.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
and
it
also
isn't
in
fact.
and
the
question
here
is--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--is
it
in
law--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--or
in
fact
that
we
are
trying
to
make
this
determination?
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
taylor
said
you
don't
look
at
facts--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--because
your
reading
of
it
requires
a
look
at
the
underlying
conduct.
it
actually
requires.
and
the
document
here
that
was
selected
to
exhibit
the
underlying
conduct
is
as
far
away
as
you
can
get
from
an
adjudicatory
document.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
in
this
case
it's
the
statute
that
was
violated,
but
you
are
correct,
justice
souter--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--that...
no.
you
are
correct
in
representing
that
the
government's
approach
to
this
will
take
what
is
quintessentially
a
question
of
law,
that
is,
a
comparison
of
adjudicated
elements
of...
adjudicated
elements
of
conviction
against...
compared
to
the
elements
of
generic
burglary.
that's
a
question
of
law.
do
they
match?
do
they
not
match?
it
becomes
a
question
of
fact
then,
as
the
first
circuit
put
it
in
shepard
and
in
the
harris
case,
to
determine
what
was
actually
in
the
mind
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
he
entered
his
plea.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
because
it's
based
on
an
examination
of
the
underlying
conduct,
which
is
forbidden
by
the
taylor
decision--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--no,
i
do
not.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
i
do
not
join--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--the
sense
it
makes
is
this.
what
the
armed
career
criminal
act
addresses
and
what
this
court
discussed
in
taylor
was
the
applicable
term
is
conviction,
that
is,
a
conviction
for
a
categorical
offense.
the
categorical
offense
is
a
crime
of
violence
specifically
described
as
burglary,
arson,
but
there
are
specifically
described
crimes.
those
are
things
that
you
can
determine
as
a
matter
of
law.
do
the
elements
match
the...
the
generically
violent
crime,
or
do
they
not
match
the
generically
violent
crime?
if
they
do
not
match
the
generically
violent
crime,
you
might
still
be
able
to
figure
out,
you
might
be
able
to
surmise
what
the
defendant
actually
had
in
his
mind,
if
he
had
anything
in
his
mind,
about
this
at
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea.
well,
one
of
the
unique
things
about
the...
these
nongeneric
burglary
statutes
in
massachusetts
is
that
they're
really
relatively
petty
offenses.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
judge
referred
to
a
police
report.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
if
you
can
look
at
the
colloquy
and
the
judge,
without
incorporating
it,
has
the
defendant
explicitly
admit
the
facts
that
constitute
the
elements
of
generic
burglary,
it
is
our
position
that
that...
that
conviction
could
be
used
to
enhance.
but--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--i
agree
that
whether
or
not
that
document
is
in
the
record,
if
there
is
an
explicit
finding
or
an
admission
by
the
court
that
enters
the
judgment,
that
the
defendant
broke
and
entered
a
building,
that
that
conviction
should
be
able
to
qualify
as
a
predicate
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
it
is
not
a
requirement
that
the
underlying
document
be
incorporated
into
the
record,
only
that
the
admission
be
made
or
the
facts
be
found
by
the
fact-finder,
whoever
is
taking
the
plea.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
certainly
not
under
taylor.
the
whole
idea
of
taylor
was
partly
dictated
by
the
words
of
the
statute.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
this
is...
it...
well,
i
don't
think
it's
comparable
because
the
district
court
finding
was
that
the
documents
that
the
government
relies
on
were
not
involved
in
the
adjudication
at
all.
so
it--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--this
is
even
farther
removed
than
a
plea
colloquy,
farther
removed
than
a
trial
transcript
looking
into
the
evidence--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--if,
for
example.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
and
i...
i
do
agree
that
that's
one
of
the
questions
presented
by
this
case.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
i
do
believe
that
the
best
reading
is
the
categorical
reading.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
but
i'm
willing
to
accept
for
example--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--for
purposes
of
argument.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
and
all
taylor
and
the
armed
career
criminal
act
are
interested
in
is
what
was
he
convicted
of.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
true.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
you
can
look
to
the
charging
document
and
the
statute
to
see
what
he
was
charged
with.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
not
to
determine
what
he
was
charged
with.
to
determine
what
he
was
convicted
of.
because
the
jury
instructions
are
not
going
to
be
factually
oriented.
the
jury
instructions
are
going
to
tell
you
what
the
element
of
the
crime
was,
elements
that
were
adjudicated.
so
that
if
you
have
the
person
charged
with
a
nongeneric
document
here...
the
nongeneric
statute,
a
boat,
a
house,
a
whatever,
and
the
jury
instructions
establish
for
you
that
he
could
not
have
been
convicted
by
that
jury
without
finding
a
house
because
that's
the
elements
laid
out
in
the
jury
instruction--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--the
police
report
does
not
show
you
what
the
results
of
the
adjudication
was.
it
does
not
establish--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--the
elements.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
i
suggest
that
it
doesn't
tell
you
anything
about
what's
actually
been
adjudicated.
what
it
tells
you,
it's
what's
actually
been
charged.
and
here's
one
of
the
things
that
came
up
in
the
district
court
in
front
of
judge
gertner,
and
the
government
brought
up
this
as
well
as
judge...
as
the
district
court
judge.
what
if
mr.
shepard
went
in
and
said,
yes,
i
broke
into
the
property
of
another
person
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime?
that
would
be
a
factual
basis
that
would
be
adequate
for
the...
for
any
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
under
that
statute.
because
the...
because
of
the
fact
that
the
boat,
the
house,
the
car,
and
the
vessel
are
all
put
on
the
same
level,
the
operative
fact
is
is
it
yours,
mr.
shepard.
does
that
belong
to
you,
mr.
shepard?
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
which
brings
me
to
henderson
against
morgan.
one
of
the
issues
in
henderson
against
morgan
is
whether
or
not
you
can
infer
guilt
of
an
element
that
is
not
specifically
charged
even
from
overwhelming
evidence,
that
that
could
be
proved.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
it
does.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
i'm
talking
about
the...
the
2
percent
that
are
nongeneric
burglary.
and
in
those
2
percent
that
are
nongeneric
burglary,
the
issue
that
is
raised,
by
the
fact
that
it's
nongeneric
burglary,
is
you
can't
make
a
determination
based
on
the
face
of
the
record
of
what
was
actually
adjudicated,
that
this
person
was
actually
found
guilty
of
each
element
of
generic
burglary.
and
when
you
cannot
make
that
determination
from
record
documents
and
contemporaneous
documents
with
the
adjudication,
then
you
cannot
make
that
determination
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
that...
that
is
part
of
the
argument,
and
i...
i
think
that
we're
just
using
different
terms
here.
you're
using
offense,
and...
and
the
taylor
court
and
the...
and
the
armed
career
criminal
act
use
conviction.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
okay.
and
so
when
you're
talking
about
a
conviction,
you're
talking
about
something
that
has
already
been
established,
that
you
should
be
able
to
make
a
determination
by
looking
at
the
contemporaneous
documents.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
well,
the
theory
that
i'm
proposing
is...
is
i
believe
the
theory
that's
already
been
adopted
by
this
court,
which
is
the...
the
one
described
in
taylor.
it's
the
categorical
approach
that
says
you
cannot
make
a
determination
of
what
elements
were
adjudicated
by
looking
at
the
underlying
conduct.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
it's--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--it
is
reliable
and
it's
also
not
fact-based.
once
you
start
to--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--that
is
one
of
my
arguments,
justice
souter,
and
the...
and
there's
something
that
goes
hand
in
glove
with
that
and
did
in
this
case.
the
burden
shifts
then
to
the
defendant.
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
was
not
convicted
of
generic
burglary,
and
that--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--assignment--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--well,
it--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--what
shifts
is
the
risk
of
being
wrong.
the
shifts...
the
risk
of
being
wrong
right
now
is
on
the
government.
if
the
government
cannot
establish
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
generic
burglary,
it
bears
that
responsibility.
if
the
defendant
cannot
establish
that
back
when
he
entered
his
plea--
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
--i
would.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
linda
j.
thompson
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
armed
career
criminal
act
does
not
punish
all
recidivism.
it
is
designed
to
punish
the
people
who
have
prior
convictions
for
those
offenses
falling...
falling
within
the
categories.
so
it's
not
designed
to
punish
all
recidivism.
massachusetts
does
have
generic
burglary
statutes.
these
statutes
that
are
at
issue
here
are
not
among
them.
but
for
the
serious
forms
of
burglary,
such
as
home
invasion,
massachusetts
punishes
those
under
generic
burglary
statutes.
so
those
do
exist.
with
regard
to
the
record
that
the
court
can
look
at
in
making
this
determination,
it
was
significant
in
the
district
court
that
judge
gertner
was
not
pointed
to
the
face
of
the
complaint.
and
as
you
look
at
the
complaints
that
are
shown
in
the
third
appendix
in
this
case,
there
is...
there
are
dates
listed
at
the
bottom.
the
entries
in
those
docket
sheets
were
made
at
different
times,
not
all
made
at
the
time
of
a
guilty
plea.
the
government
did
not
present
any
evidence
to
help
the
court
understand
anything
about
the
way
the
dockets
were
made
and
the
entries
were
made
when
a
guilty
plea
was
taken
in
the
district
court.
the
third
thing
of
interest
is,
as
judge
gertner
found,
there
was
no
reason
for
a
contemporaneous
contest
of
the
evidence...
of
the
material
in
the
police
report
because
the
police
report
was
not
part
of
the
plea
proceeding.
so
what
happens
is
the
district
court
that's
faced
with
the
sentencing
issue
now
has
to
make
the
determination,
can
i
now
look
and
see
whether
there
was
some
contest
years
ago
when
the
guilty
plea
was
entered
without
the
aid
of
a
contemporaneous
record
of
adjudication.
and
what
mr.
shepard's
position
is,
as
to
what
the...
the
rule
should
be,
is
that
where...
and
we
don't
contest
even
remotely
that
guilty
pleas
don't
fall
under
the
ambit
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
taylor
was
a
guilty
plea
itself.
that
case
was
a
guilty
plea...
is
that
where
you
have
a
nongeneric
statute
and
you
have
a
conviction
by
a
guilty
plea,
that
the
court
can
look
at
a
charging
document
and
a
contemporaneous
formal
record
of
adjudication,
not
simply
anything
that's
found
in
the
court
file,
and
that
must
establish,
based
on
that
examination,
that
the
defendant
was
necessarily
found
guilty
of
all
the
elements
of
generic
burglary
either
by
his
own
admission
or
by
a
finding
by
the
judge.
thank
you.
