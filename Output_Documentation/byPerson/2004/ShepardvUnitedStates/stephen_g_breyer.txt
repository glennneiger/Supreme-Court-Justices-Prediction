justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
don't
understand
your
reading
of
taylor.
as
i've
read
that
case
many
times,
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
was
making
a
perfectly
sensible
point.
at
the
end
of
the
opinion,
justice
blackmun
says,
you
know,
there
are
some
states
like
massachusetts,
for
example,
that
instead
of
just
saying
burglary,
they
say
burglary
of
a...
of
a
ship
or
a
car
or
a
building.
and
that
leads
us
to
answer
a
more
general
question.
well,
in
context,
that
more
general
question
is
whether
you
ought
to
go
look
into
how
a
particular
burglary
was
committed
to
see
if
there
was
really
violence
or
not.
and
he
says
no.
just
look
to
the
definition
of
the
crime.
that's
what
he
says.
that
will
end
it.
now,
he
says
we
agree,
because
i
started
here,
that
we
have
a
couple
of
states
with
some
weird
statutes,
and
what
you
have
to
do
in
those
states
is
you
won't
know
if
it's
a
boat
or
a
car
or...
so
he
says,
for
example,
in
a
state
like
the
one
we
have,
if
it
shows
it's
charged
us
with
a
burglary
and
you
have
to
find
out,
you
know,
here's
what
you
do.
it
says
you
may
have
to
go
beyond
the
mere
fact
of
conviction.
so
he
says
go
look
to
the
indictment
or
information
and
jury
instructions.
that
isn't
a
limiting
phrase.
that's
for
example.
he
just
thought
that
in
those
cases,
that's
what...
all
you'll
have
to
look
to,
for
example.
we
happen
to
have
an
unusual
case
where
there
are
no
jury
instructions
because
he
pled
guilty.
so
what's
the
harm
of
going
looking
to
the
documents
that
will
show,
in
an
uncontested
way,
just
what
the
address
on
these
pieces
of
paper
show?
there
are
no
boats,
you
know,
in
watertown.
it's
not
a
dock,
i
don't
think,
or
at
least
not
in
that
part
of
it.
so...
so
i
mean,
what's
the
problem
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
everyone
so
mixed
up?
i
must
be
missing
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
problem?
i
grant
you
i
could
imagine
a
case
that
could
be
a
problem.
maybe
it
was
a
houseboat.
okay?
[laughter]
or
maybe
it's
like
a
trailer.
so
if
we
run
into
that
case,
we'll
deal
with
it.
you
know,
i'm
perfectly
capable
of
thinking
that
if
this
is
a
charge
where
there
is
a
dispute
on
the
contested
point,
fine,
we
won't
take
that
dispute
into
account,
maybe
decide
it
in
the
favor
of
the
defendant,
maybe.
but
this
is
not
that
case.
and
by
the
way,
if
he's
going
to
say,
how
do
you
know?
i'd
say,
i
know.
i
know
boston
and
i
also
know
that
breaking
into
a
boat
at
least
is
unusual.
so
if
he
thinks
it
wasn't
that,
let
him
say
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
of
course,
there
wasn't.
so
all
he
has
to
do
now
is
say,
judge,
in
my
latest
thing,
you
know,
they
say
30
bremer
street.
30
bremer
street
sounds
like
the
address
of
a
building,
but
by
the
way,
unusually
enough,
it's
the
license
plate
of
a
car.
now,
if
in
fact
that's
the
case,
he
can
come
in
and
say
it.
there's
no
fifth
amendment
problem.
we're
talking
about
sentencing
and
what
a
prior
conviction
was.
he
doesn't
even
have
to
say
it.
you
as
his
lawyer
could
tell
us.
now,
you
know
why
i
think
you
don't
say
it?
because
it
isn't
conceivably
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean
it
isn't
right
in
fact?
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
look
to
facts
about
what
the
prior
convictions
were
about.
that's
what
taylor
says.
that,
of
course,
is
a
fact,
but
it's
a
legal
fact,
what
was
this
conviction
for.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
your
reading
of
it.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what's
wrong
with
my
reading
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
try
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
we're
now
talking
about
that
part
of
taylor
which
deals
with
a
narrow
statute
where
our
object
is
not
to
find
out
what
he's
guilty
of
or
anything.
we're
just
trying
to
find
out
what
was
the
crime
he
was
charged
with.
and
there
are
two
or
three
states
which
lump
together
in
one
statute
crimes
that
are
violent
and
nonviolent.
burglary
of
a
structure
is
violent.
burglary
of
a
car
or
a
ship
is
not.
so
all
we
want
to
know
is
what
was
the
charge
at
issue.
now,
do
you...
let
me
break
the
question
into
two
parts.
the
key
sentence
here,
i
think,
is
for
example,
in
a
state
whose
burglary
statutes
include
entry
of
an
automobile,
as
well
as
a
building,
if
the
indictment
or
information
and
jury
instructions
show
that
the
defendant
was
charged
only
with
burglary
of
a
building,
then
it's
going
to
be
violent.
now,
would
you...
would
you
agree
with
me
or
not
that
he
could
have
written...
justice
blackmun...
that
same
sentence
to
say
if,
for
example,
the
indictment
or
information
and
jury
instructions
show?
would
you
be
willing
to
add
those
two
words,
for
example?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if,
for
example.
i
want
to
know
how...
how
absolute
you're
making
this.
and
the
next
question
i'd
ask
would
be
if
you
agree
for
example,
what
are
the
things
you
can
look
to
and
what
are
the
things
you
can't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
do
you
want
add
the
for
example
or
do
you
want
to
take
it
just
categorically?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
what
kinds
of
things
would
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no.
i
will
get
that
later.
let
me
deal
with
the
charge.
if
he
was
charged
with
breaking
into
a
boat,
that's
the
end
of
this.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
fine.
so
i
want
to
know
what
he
was
charged
with.
let
me
do
that
one.
now,
what
will
you
let
me
look
to
to
see
what
he
was
charged
with?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
happens
in
the
case
where...
justice
blackmun
let
us
go
further
than
that.
he
says
the
indictment...
that's
the
charging
document...
or
information
and
jury
instruction.
he'll
let
us
look
to
a
jury
instruction
as
if
there's
actually
been
a
trial.
so
he'll
let
us
go
further
than
you
will.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
a
police
report
that
makes
it
quite
clear
that
in
the
circumstances
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
boat
or
a
car
being
involved?
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
the
police
report?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
what
shows
us
that...
what
shows
us
that
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
check
mark.
no.
the
check
mark
on
the
form
that
says,
for
example,
plea,
admit
sufficient
facts.
you
know,
that's
a
check
mark
or
it's
on
the
form.
it
says
plea,
guilty.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
could
have
different
things
checked.
so
that's
what
established
the
guilt.
and
then
the
police
report
establishes
whether...
what
kind
of
a
thing
was
at
issue.
and
i
will
agree
with
you
that
if
it's
at
all
contested,
we
shouldn't
get
into
it.
but
if
it's
not
contested,
there's
no
question.
there
was
no
boat
around
there.
it's
a
city
street.
or
there
was
no
car.
it's
plain
it
was
a
building.
then
that's
just
as
good
as
the
jury
instruction.
why
not?
tell
me
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
but
that's
always
true.
you
could
have
a...
you
could
have
a...
a
sheet
that
shows:
admitted,
assault,
you
know.
and...
and
what
the
sheet
says,
it
says:
charge,
assault;
plea,
guilty.
it's
possible,
for
all
we
know,
that
when
the
actual
colloquy
took
place,
he
was
talking
about
some
other
thing.
i
don't
know
what
he
was
talking
about,
but
what
you'd
go
upon
is
that
there
was
a
charge
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
don't...
good.
are
you
going
to
explain
this?
because
i
thought
what
we
were
supposed
to
do
is
just
look
to
the
sheet,
charge;
the
plea,
guilty.
and
that
is
what
we
do
and
it
disposes
of
98
percent
of
the
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so...
so
are
you
talking
about
those
98
percent
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your...
what
rule
would
you
have
here?
the
question
is,
was
he
convicted
of
a
crime
of
violence?
98
percent
of
the
cases,
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
to
the
crime
charged,
burglary,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted.
he
pleaded
guilty
or
didn't.
but
there
are
these
two...
three
states
i
guess
that
lump
together
in
one
code
provision
for
breaking
and
entering
into
a
ship
or
a
car
or
a
house.
so
now
we've
got
to
know
which
of
the
three
it
is.
if
they
go
to
trial,
it's
easy.
just
look
to
the
jury
instructions.
if
they
plead
guilty,
i
guess
your
opponents
would
say
that's
the
end
of
it.
you
can't
use
it
because
we
don't
ever
know
from
the
charge
itself
which
of
the
three
it
was
that
was
at
issue.
was
a
house
at
issue?
was
a
car
at
issue?
was
a
boat
at
issue?
now,
you're
going
to
say,
but
do
a
little
investigating
to
find
out
what
was
at
issue.
look
at
the
police
report.
is
your
view
look
at
anything
as
long
as
it's
uncontested
and
clear?
their
argument
is
no
matter
what
you
look
into,
once
you
go
beyond
that
charging
document,
you're
going
to
find
i
think
justice
souter's
point.
it's
going
to
be
ambiguous
sometimes.
you
get
into
facts
of
things
happened
years
ago.
it's
just
not
worth
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
we're
still
going
to
have
to
write
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
what's
your
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then...
but
reading
it
that
way,
which
is
arguable,
this
case,
but
reading
it
that
way,
you'd
say
you
can
look...
what
we're
interested
in
is
not
what
happened.
we
are
interested
in
what
kind
of
a
crime
was
at
issue.
and
where
it's
difficult
to
decide
what
crime
is
at
issue,
you
can
look
to
whatever
official
documents
are
there
at
the
time,
any
court
records,
to
make
that
determination,
but
there...
if
there
is
any
indication
that
they're...
they're
contested,
if
there's
any
dispute
as
to
what
was
at
issue,
then
you
can't
count
it.
then
it
doesn't
count.
what
about
that
as
a
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you'd
say
there's...
you
can
look
to
what
justice
stevens
says.
you
can
look
to
what
is
official
in
that
record
that
seems
to
have
indication
of
reliability,
and
if
there
is
any
indication
at
all
that
this
was
a
matter
in
dispute,
you
can't
count
the
conviction.
that
would
be
the
rule.
