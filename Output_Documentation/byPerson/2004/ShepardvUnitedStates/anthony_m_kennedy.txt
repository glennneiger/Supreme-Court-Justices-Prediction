justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
in
the
earlier
conviction,
the
police
report
is
in
the
court.
it's
not
part
of
the
record,
and
then
the
court
says,
i've
read
the
police
report.
is
that
accurate?
and
the
client...
or
the
defendant
says,
yes.
then
later,
can
we
go
back
and
look
at
the
police
report
even
though
it
was
not
annexed
as
part
of
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--taylor
were
not
on
the
books.
what...
what
would
be
the
basis
of
your
argument?
you
say
that
it's
all
right
to
look
at
a
plea
colloquy,
but
it's
not
all
right
to
look
at
an
arrest
report
to
which
the
judge
referred.
what's
the
basis
for
that
distinction?
what
sense
does
it
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
why
can
you
look
at
what's
in
the
plea
colloquy
that's
in
the
record,
but
you
cannot
look
at
a
document
that
the
judge
referred
to,
if
that
document
isn't
there?
what's...
what's
the
common
sense
argument
that
you're
making?
i...
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
this
is
my
little
hypothetical
case
so
that
we
can
test
your
theory,
just
to
see
the
reasons
that
you're
advancing
for...
for
us
to
rule
in
your
favor.
and
i...
i
don't
see
any
rationale
that
you've
given
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
why
can't
you
go
one
step
further
and
refer
to
the
document
that
was
not
in
the
record
but
that
the
judge
mentioned
in
his...
in
his
findings
at
the
first
sentencing?
why?
i
still
haven't
had
a
reason
why.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you...
you
still
haven't
given
a
reason,
other
than
the
one
justice
souter
accepts.
look
it.
this
is
a
case
where
we
all
know
what
the
truth
is,
but
you
want
to
argue
that
we
shouldn't
find
that
out.
and
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
give
us
a
rationale
for
we
shouldn't
know
the
truth
here.
you...
you
don't
want
us
to
find
it,
and
there
must
be
some
reasons
for
that.
and
the
law
does
that
once
in
a
while.
we
all
know
that
something
happened,
but
the
law
is
supposed
to
pretend
it
didn't.
that's
why
justice
has
a
blindfold
on.
i...
i
know
that.
but
you
haven't
given
me
one
reason
yet
why
i
should
adopt
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
test
is
whether
or
not
there's
reliable
record
evidence?
is
that...
that
the
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it...
does
the
plea
refer
to
the
police
report?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
is
there
some...
i...
i
take
it
that
you
say
certainly
if
the
plea
colloquy
or
the...
or
the
judge's
guilt
determination
refers
to
the
police
report,
then
the
police
report
comes
in.
suppose
there's
no
reference
to
the
police
report.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
still
go
find
the
police
report
and
then
where
do
we
stop?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
mentioned--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you...
you
mentioned
the
state
file.
is...
is
the
rule
whatever
is
in
the
state
file,
even
if
there's
no
reference
to
it?
you
had...
you
had
two
variables:
one
that
there
was
reference
to
it;
and
two,
that
it
was
in
state
file.
suppose
there's
no
reference,
but
it
is
in
the
state
file.
what...
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
what
rule
you
would
draw?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
we...
are
we
going
to
decide...
decide
a
lot
of
probate
cases
about
incorporation
by
reference
in
wills
and
stuff?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
what
we're
supposed
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
want
us
to
write
the
opinion
that
we
can
presume
that
what's
in
the
state
investigative
files
and
records
was
likely
before
the
trial
court?
i...
i'd
like
to
know
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
don't
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
write.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
souter
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
shepard
versus
united
states,
no.
