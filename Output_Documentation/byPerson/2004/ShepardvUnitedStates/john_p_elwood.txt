mr.
john
p.
elwood
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
defendant
has
been
convicted
under
a
state
statute
that
prohibits
both
burglary
of
a
building
and
burglary
of
a
car
or
some
other
item,
the
court
can
still
look
to
the
conviction
to
determine
whether
it
is
an
armed
career
criminal
act
predicate
when,
as
here,
the
police
report
indicates
the
defendant
was
arrested
for
burglarizing
a
building
rather
than
a
ship
or
a
car
and
the
other
documents
in
the
file
corroborate
that
the
basis
for
the
plea
was
the
crime
outlined
in
the
police
report.
because
two
of
the
three
elements
of
generic
burglary...
that
is,
breaking
and
entering
and
intent
to
commit
a
crime--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
in
a
case
where
the
police
report
was
ambiguous
about
what
it
is
that
the
person
broke
into,
i
think
that
you
could
not
base
the
enhancement
on
that.
we
are
asking
only
when
both
the
police
report
is
unambiguous
and
the
documents
recording
the
guilty
plea
suggest--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
you
might
be
able
to--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
think
that
you
could
talk
about
introducing
extrinsic
evidence
of...
of
that
sort.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
go
that
far,
and
i
think
in
the
run-up
cases--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
don't
think
so
in
this
case
because
the
police
report
is
in...
in
a
police
file
itself.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
and
i
don't
think
you
could
for
an
additional
reason,
which
is
that
i
don't
think
assault
and
battery
is
necessarily
a...
is
a
necessary
element
of
the...
of...
of...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
right,
violent
and
nonviolent.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
exactly
right.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
only
rule
we
are
advocating
is
that
when
we
are
talking
about
a
necessary
element
of
the
offense
that
can
be
satisfied
in
different
ways,
that
you
can
look
to
the
police
report
to
indicate
which
way
it
was
met
in
this
case
if
the
rest
of
the
file,
the
state
court
file,
indicates
that
the
police
report
was
the...
provided
the
factual
basis
or
provided
the
basis
for
the
conviction.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
file
in
this
case,
for
example,
for
four
of
the
defendant's--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--we
believe
that
the
record
indicates
that
it
was.
for
four
of
the
defendant's
convictions,
if
you
look
at
the
document
that
records
the
guilty
plea,
it...
it
says...
in
addition
to
the
notation
of
guilty,
and
as
justice
breyer
averred,
a
check
of
admit
sufficient
facts
or
that
there
are
sufficient
facts
present,
it
lists
the
same
date
of
the
offense,
the
same
street
address,
the
same
arresting
officer,
and
the
same
victim.
and
it
is
our
submission
that
that
implies
certainly
very
strongly...
it
supports
a
very
strong
inference...
that
the
crime
of
conviction
was
the
very
same
crime
that
is
described
in
the
police
report.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
to
begin
with,
judge
gertner
looked
only
to...
she
didn't
draw
any
inference
based
on
the
document
recording
the
guilty
plea
and
what
happened.
she
looked
only
to
the
direct
evidence
of
what
happened
in
the
colloquy,
i.e.,
the
petitioner's
affidavit.
but
even
more
than
that,
her
only
finding
was
that
the
police
report,
as
a
police
report,
was
not
introduced
at
the
plea
colloquy.
it
wasn't
marked
as
an
exhibit.
it
wasn't
attached
to
anything.
it
wasn't
introduced
as
that.
i
don't
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
idea
that
as
is
often
the
case
and
is
probably
usually
the
case,
that
the
police
report
was
synopsized
by
the
prosecutor
and...
and
read
at
court,
which
would
explain
why
the
offense
of
conviction
has
the
same
offense
date,
same
street
address,
same
victim,
same
arresting
officer.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
but
we
do
know
that
under
massachusetts
state
law,
that
there...
before
a
court
can
accept
a
guilty
plea,
there
has
to
be
a
factual
basis
in
the
record.
there
have
to
be
facts
in
the
record
to
support
every
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the
requirement...
the
factual
basis
requirement
requires
a
statement
of
the
facts,
not
a
statement
of
the
legal
conclusion,
and
simply
reading
the
charging
document
as
a
legal
conclusion
about
what
it...
about
a
boat,
building,
et
cetera
was
broken
into.
what
it
requires
is
a
narrative
description
of
the
underlying
conduct
so
that
the
judge
can
satisfy
him
or
herself
to
what
the
defendant
is
pleading
guilty
to
is
actually
a
crime.
if
he
just
says,
i
agree
with
the
charging
document,
if
the
underlying
facts
were
he
broke
into
a
grocery
cart
or
a...
a
refrigerator
shipping
box
or
something,
it
might
not
satisfy
the
elements
of
the
crime.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
would
have
satisfied
the
factual
basis
requirement
in
that
there
has
to
be
a
narrative
description
of
what
the
defendant
did,
like
he
showed
up
at
that
day
and
he
broke
into
258
norwell
street.
and
i
have
yet
to
find
a
massachusetts
case
where
a...
a
guilty
plea
was
accepted
based
on
basically
just
a
recitation
of
the
charging
document--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no.
there's...
there's
no
facts...
there's
no...
as
is
the
case
often
in
guilty
pleas,
which
are
not
challenged
on
appeal,
no
colloquy
was
ever
prepared
and
apparently
the
tape
recording
was
destroyed.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
yes,
whether
there's
reliable
record
evidence
that
is
reliable
in
describing
what
the
offense
was
that
was
the
subject
of
the
plea
colloquy.
and
in
this
case,
we
believe
it
is
met
both
because
the
police
report
is
unambiguous,
as
several
of
the
members
of
the
court
have
averred
to,
and
that
the
documents
recording
the
guilty
plea
i
think
very
clearly
indicate
that
the
thing
that
was
at
issue
was
the
crime
described
in
the
police
report.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
it
does
not.
it
doesn't
in
so
many
words
refer
to
the
police
report,
but
it
refers
to...
it...
it,
i
think,
unambiguously
describes
the
crimes
described
in
the
police
report
and
that
it
involves,
as
i
said,
the
same
date,
the
same
street
address,
the
same
victim,
and
the
same
arresting
officer.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
if
there's
no
reference
to
the
police
report
and
if
the
police
report
is
not
in
the
state
court
file,
which
it
was
in
this
case...
the
court
indicated
it
was
in
the
state
court
file...
i...
i
think
that
you
would
probably
have
to
have
a
stronger
showing
in
order
to
say,
well,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
police
report
such
as
a...
a
reference
to
the
police
report
or
more
of
an
indication
on
the
guilty
plea
form,
a
notation
of...
of
what
was
entered
or--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--something
that
unambiguously
indicated
the
police
report
provided
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
the...
if...
i...
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
both
an...
that
the
police
report
is
unambiguous
and
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
or
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
police
report
provided
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
and
if
it's...
if
there's
no
reference
to
it
in
so
many
words,
i
think
the
same
could
be
said
this...
that
the
same
could
be
said
here
in
this
case.
it
doesn't
say
we
look
to
the
police
report.
you
just
draw
that
inference
from
the
fact
that
the
crime
described
looks
like
the
crime
described
in
the
police
report.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
our
argument...
or
the...
the
proposition
that
we
are
arguing
for
today
is
that
when
the
documents
and
the
state
court
file
indicate
that
the
defendant
was
arrested
for
only
burglary
of
a
building
and
there's
no
question
that
it
wasn't
a
ship
or
a
vehicle,
that
it
will
support
the
acca--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--correct.
when--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right.
when
the
other
documents
in
the
file
indicate
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
police
report
or
that
that
description
of
events
served
as
the
basis
for
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i...
i
think--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
that
in
this
case
it
just...
i
don't
think
the
court
really
has
to
get
to
the
outer
reaches
of
this
because
in
many
of
these
cases,
it's
overwhelming--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--no.
because
the...
the
important
thing
is
not
just
describing
what
actually
happened,
but
what...
what
happened
on
the
day
the
guilty
plea
was
taken.
and
that
is
where
the
documents
that
record
the
plea
i
think
come
in
to
show--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--the
police
report
was
prepared
earlier,
but
when
the
crime...
when
they
wrote
down
guilty,
the
offense
he
was
guilty
of
is
breaking
into
a
certain
address
at
a
certain
day,
belonging
to
a
certain
victim,
and
involving
the
same
arresting
officer.
and
we
believe
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--well,
perhaps
because
you
can
refer
to
the
police
report.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
you
really
only
have
to
look
at...
the...
the
fact
that
these
are
present
in
the
court's
files
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--they
are
present
in
the
court's
files.
the
court
said
they
were
present
in
the
court's
files.
they
just
said
they
didn't
become
part
of
the
plea
colloquy
because
of--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think,
though,
that
there's...
there
would
be
no
particular
reason
to
believe
that
the
warrant
application
had
been...
had
served
as
the
basis
for
the
guilty
plea.
i
mean,
if
you
had
some
sort
of--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--if...
i...
i
think
that
if
the
documents
recording
the
guilty
plea
indicate
that
the...
that
the
crime
described
is
the
crime
described
in
the
warrant
application,
you
probably
could
look
at
that
if...
to
determine
if
it
was
a
boat
or
a
building
or--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--perhaps.
the...
the
whole
thing
about
the
warrant
application,
though,
strikes
me
as...
as
a
little
bit
more
attenuated,
though,
also
because
it's
done
in
advance
of
the
police
arriving
on
the
scene
and
discovering
what's
going
on
whereas
the
police
report--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--right.
but
still
it's...
it's
done
beforehand
as
opposed
to
done
after
the
crime
has
been
investigated.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
under
a
sort
of
a...
theoretically
that's
a...
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility,
justice
souter.
i
don't
think
that
would
happen
a
lot
in
actual
practice
because
the
sort
of
people
who
are
prosecutional
witnesses
have
a
sufficient
caseload
that
they're
just
never
going
to
have
in
a...
a
actual
recollection
of
specific
events.
and
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it's...
it's
both
contemporaneity,
if
i've
said
that
correctly,
but
i
think
also
a...
a
reason
to
infer
that
it
provided
the
basis
for
the
plea...
for
the
plea
colloquy,
which
it
is
in
this
case
because--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that's
correct.
and--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--it
has
been
destroyed,
but
massachusetts
state
law
requires
that
there
be
a
factual
basis
before
the
court
can
accept
a
guilty
plea.
and
i
think
we
can...
under
the
presumption
of
regularity
that
attaches
to
guilty
pleas,
you
can
presume
that
occurred.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
no,
there
isn't.
they're
all
punished
the
same.
so
it's
not
as
though
this
was
a...
a
lesser
included
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that
when
the...
basically
when
the
police
report
is
unambiguous
and
when
the
documents
in
the
state
court
file
indicate
that
the
basis
for
the
guilty
plea
was
the
crime
described
in
the
police
report,
that
you
can
infer
that
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea,
which
is
required
under
massachusetts
law,
was
in
fact
the
breaking
into
a
building
as
opposed
to
a
ship
or
a
vehicle
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
to
me
it's
not
100
percent
clear
whether
when
taylor
referred
to
the
jury
instructions
and
the
charging
documents,
that
that
was
exhaustive
of
the
jury
trial
conflict.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
right.
it
could
be
something
else.
but
i
think
that
if
you
were
going...
it's
still
possible
to
draw
the
distinction
based
on
an
administrability
factor,
which
is
the
way
many
courts
have
looked
at
it,
which
is
you
don't
want
to
have
to
have
the
court
look
back
to
transcripts
of
the
whole
thing
versus...
for
the
whole
trial,
whereas
if
they
can
look
at
a
discrete
body
of
documents
and
say
yes,
this
guy
pleaded
guilty
to
burglary
of
a
building,
that
you
can
reach
that
conclusion.
it's
a
line
of
administrability,
not
a...
a
line
of
testimony
with
the
documents.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
i
think
that
it
has
proven
administrable.
and
it...
it...
i
think
that
the
majority
of
courts
allow
you
to
look
at
court
documents
in
order
to
determine
what
was...
what
sort
of
offense
was
at
issue
and...
and
that--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think
it's
definitely
should
be
interpreted
to
include
guilty
pleas
because
taking
taylor
literally,
i
mean,
they
only
discussed
jury
trials.
but
every
court
with
criminal
jurisdiction,
every
court
of
appeals
with
criminal
jurisdiction,
has
concluded
that
it
includes
guilty
pleas.
and
so
i
think
it...
it
does
make
sense.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
would
have
in
such
a
short
section
of
the
opinion
have
exhaustively
addressed
the
entire
scope
of
factual
situations,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
have
addressed
the
circumstance
under
which
most
guilty
pleas...
or
rather,
under
which
most
convictions
are
obtained--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
think
that
is
a
sensible
rule.
i
mean,
basically
our
rule--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i...
i
think
that
would
be
a
sensible
rule.
and
in
this
case,
as...
as
we
indicated,
not
only
are
the
police
reports
unambiguous,
but
there's
a
very
strong
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
the
basis
for
the
guilty
plea
as
it
was
obtained
on
that
day.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
as
i
recall
groh,
that
case
specifically
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
face
of
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
the
warrant
describe,
not
that
the
supporting
documents
describe,
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
items
to
be
seized.
and
i
think
in
this
case
we
already
know
it's
okay
to
look
behind
convictions
because
taylor
itself
says
so.
the
only
question
is
what
items
are
acceptable,
and--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--i
think,
though,
that
in
the
context
that...
that
is,
if
you're
going
to
include
guilty
pleas
at
all
for
these
sort
of
straddle
offenses
that...
that
some
of
the
conduct
is
generic
burglary
and
some
isn't,
that
if
taylor
is
accepted
on
face
value,
where
it
isn't
an
example,
then
it...
it
basically
would
mean
that,
sub
silentio,
the...
the
court
had
held
that
guilty
pleas
could
not
be
used
at
all
for
this
sort
of
inquiry
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
which
i
think
would
be
extraordinarily
or...
or
it
would
definitely
limit
at
least
the
utility
of
the
acca
as
an
act
punishing
recidivism
because
the
vast
majority
of
convictions
are
obtained
through
criminal--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--but
if
the...
i
don't
think...
i
think
that
whenever
there
is
a
straddle
crime
and
that
the
charging
document
is--
mr.
john
p.
elwood
--that
is
probably
the
case.
i
know
that
there
are
something
like
28
states
that
have
them.
mr.
john
p.
elwood
there...
there
are
many
states
that...
that
have
offenses
that
include
both
generic
and
nongeneric
burglary,
although
i
think
that
it's
probably
true
that
most...
most
burglary
statutes
are
either
generic
or
nongeneric,
not
sort
of
straddled
like
that.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
it
would
significantly
limit
the
utility
of
the
acca.
and
in
addition,
every
court
of
appeals
with
criminal
jurisdiction
has
held
that
that's
not
what
it
means,
that
it
does
mean,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
that
that
was
one
example
that
the
court
meant.
it
is,
after
all,
a
fairly
abbreviated
discussion
that
wasn't
briefed
by
the
parties
in
the
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
read
it
so
expansively
based
on
relatively
ambiguous
language.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
we'll
rely
on
our
submission.
