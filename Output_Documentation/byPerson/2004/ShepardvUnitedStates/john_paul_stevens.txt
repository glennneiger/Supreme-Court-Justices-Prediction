justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
hear
argument
in
shepard
against
the
united
states.
ms.
thompson.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
assume
the
case
had
been
tried
and
you
could
not
tell
from
either
the
indictment
or
the
instructions
to
the
jury
whether
it
was
a
generic
burglary
or
a
nongeneric
burglary.
would
the...
our
decision
permit
us
to
look
at
the
transcript
of
the
trial
to
answer
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
argument
is
that
this
is
comparable
to
using
the
transcript
of
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
this
is
even
farther
removed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
thompson,
you
know
your
white
light
is
on.
so
if
you
want
to
save
time,
you
should
perhaps
do
so
right
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
elwood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
suppose
the
police
report
had
been
ambiguous
and
referred
to
both
a
boat
and
a
house.
what
would...
could...
would
it
be...
what
would
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why...
why
couldn't
you
use
it
in
the
other
case?
couldn't
you
ask
the
police
officer
what
he...
who
conducted
the
investigation
what
the
facts
really
were?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you'd
start
out
with
the
premise
that
90
percent
of
these
cases
are
really
houses
anyway,
so
there's
a
strong
presumption
in
favor
of
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the...
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
police
report
is
extrinsic
evidence,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
that
it
was
an
assault
and
battery,
for
example,
and
you're
trying
to
decide
whether
it
was
violent
or
not,
and
the
police
report
was
somewhat
ambiguous.
could
you...
you
couldn't
look
at
it
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
a
distinction
between
violent
assaults
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--nonviolent
assaults.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
might
want
to
find
out
which
one
it
was
and...
and
as
here,
it
seems
pretty
easy.
everybody
knows
most
burglaries
are...
are
of
houses.
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
we're
not
trying
to
find
out
what
the
categorical
rule
is
that...
that
is
at
stake
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
it
provided
the
basis
for
the
conviction.
was
it
presented
to
the
court
in
each
of
these
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
couldn't
the
judge
in
that
colloquy
have
said
to
him,
did
you
break
into
a
building,
a
car,
or
a
boat?
and
he
would
have
said
yes,
and
wouldn't
that
have
satisfied
the
element
of
the
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
we
don't
get
to
the
outer
reaches,
the
next
case
i
suppose
will
involve
a...
an
application
for
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant
which
describes
facts
and
pretty
well
tells
you
what
really
happened.
could
you
rely
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
police
report
wasn't
made
on
that
date.
the
police
report
was
prepared
earlier,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
it's
that...
if
it's
that
explicit,
i
don't
think
you
need
the
police
report.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
we're
dealing
with
a
case
in
which
the
court
documents
are
sufficiently
ambiguous
that
you
have
to
look
to
something
else.
then
the
question
is
what
other
things
may
you
look
to,
and
you
say
we
can
look
to
police
reports.
i
say
why
not
look
at
warrant
applications
or
maybe
the
prosecutor's
notes,
or
there
could
be
other
equally
reliable
documents
available,
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
would...
which
establish
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
police
reports
were
not
present
in
the
court--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
elwood,
can
i
tell
you
what's
troubling
me
about
that?
maybe
the
whole
categorical
approach
is
unwise.
it
may
have
been
more
strict
than
it
should
be.
but
it...
i'm
puzzled
by
the
notion
that
in
a
case
that's
been
tried
to
verdict,
you
can
only
look
at
the
indictment
and
the
instructions,
as
i
understand
justice
blackmun's
opinion.
you
could
not
look
at
the
testimony
in
the
record,
even
though
there
are
nine
witnesses
who
described
what
happened.
it
seems
to
me
that
might
be
much
more
reliable
than
a
police
report.
and
i'm
just
wondering
am
i
correct,
do
you
think,
on
saying
you
cannot
look
at
the
testimony
in
the
tried
case?
and
if
so,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
say
that
police
reports
are
better
than
sworn
witnesses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
for
example
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
i'm
just
questioning
is
whether
this
rule
that
you...
you're
advocating
is
really
more
administrable
than
one
that
just
says
it
seems
crazy
in
this
particular
case.
but...
but
in
the
interest
of
having
a
categorical
administrative
rule,
we'll
simply
say
whatever
the
public
record
shows
and
the
proceedings
themselves.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
aren't
the
vast
majority
of
guilty
pleas
unambiguous?
this
is
a
rather
rare
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
whenever
straddle
crimes,
but...
but
they're
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
burglary
i
think
in
most
states
would
be
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
elwood.
ms.
thompson,
you
have
a
little
over
3
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
thompson.
the
case
is
submitted.
