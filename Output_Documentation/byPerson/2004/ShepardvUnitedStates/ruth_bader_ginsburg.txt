justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why...
why
are
you
resisting
that
the...
that
the
police
report
gave
an
identified
building?
i
mean,
you're...
you're
saying
that
one
mustn't
look
behind,
in
the
case
of
a
guilty
plea,
to
find
the
police
report
or
even
the
police
application
for
complaint.
but
there
isn't
any
question,
is
there,
that
the
police
reports
in
fact
gave
addresses
of
particular
buildings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what...
what
you're
saying
is
the
conviction
itself
didn't
show
that,
and
so
the
question
is
whether
you
can
look
to
documents
that
in
fact
showed
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
defendant
at
the
plea
colloquy
had
said,
yes,
i
entered
x
building
or
even
in
the
plea
bargain
had
said
that,
even
though
the
charge
just
read
the
boiler
plate,
the
whole
statute,
buildings,
vessels,
et
cetera,
if
he
had
admitted
it
either
in
the
plea
colloquy
or
in
the
plea
bargain,
wouldn't
that
be
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let
us
look
to
and
what
kinds
of
things
not?
all
we're
interested
in
is
what
was
he
charged
with,
which
of
these
three
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
judge
gertner
said
she
didn't
know
whether
anybody
had
seen
this
police
report.
it
wasn't
attached
to
the
charge.
i
thought
that
was
her
position,
that
these
are
untested
documents.
we
don't
know
one
way
or
another
whether
the
judge
that
accepted
the
plea
had
seen
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
don't
have
any
colloquy.
we
don't
know
what
happened
at
the...
you're
saying
it's...
it's
altogether
likely
that
that
happened,
but
we
don't
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
defendant
says,
yes,
i
plead
guilty
to
this
crime
and
the
crime
is
described
as
ship,
vessel,
car,
building,
and
that's...
if
that's
all
that
happened
is
the
boiler
plate
charge
that
just
repeats
the
statute
and
the
defendant
says,
yes,
i
did
that,
but
nothing
tells
us
did
what,
other
than
violate
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
elwood,
we
had
a
case
last
term
involving
a
search
warrant,
groh
against
ramirez,
and
it...
it
was
very
clear
that
the
application
for
the
warrant
identified
specifically
what
the
police
were
to
search
for,
but
the
warrant
itself
didn't.
and
this
court
held
you
couldn't
look
behind
that
blank
warrant
for
the
particulars
that
were
revealed
in
the
warrant
application.
and
i
suppose
this
is
similar
in
the
sense
that
we
have
the
conviction
and
you're
saying,
but
you
can
look
behind
that
conviction
to
something
that,
we
don't
know,
may
or
may
not
have
been
before
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
taylor...
taylor
doesn't
quite
have
this
full
for
example
because
there's
another
paragraph
following
the
for
example
paragraph
which
says
we
hold
an
offense
constitutes
burglary
for
purposes
of
924(e)
if
either
the
statutory
definition
corresponds
to
generic
burglary,
which
it
doesn't
here,
or
the
charging
paper,
which
it
doesn't
here,
and
jury
instructions,
which
the
judge
tells
the
jury
you
must
find
this
in
order
to
convict.
those
are
not
for
examples.
that
paragraph
says
you've
got
three
things
you
can
look
to.
you
can
look
to
the
statutory
definition.
you
can
look
to
the
charging
paper,
and
you
can
look
to
the
jury
instruction.
and
that's
it.
