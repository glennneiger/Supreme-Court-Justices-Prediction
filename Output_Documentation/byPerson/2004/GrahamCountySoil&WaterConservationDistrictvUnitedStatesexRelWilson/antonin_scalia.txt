justice

scalia
they
could
have
done
the
same
in
3731(c)
also.
instead
of
just
saying
any
action
brought
under
section
3730,
they
could
have
said
any
action
brought
under...
which
one?
(a)
of...
of...
which
is
the
one
that
allows
the
government
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
(a).
they
could
have
said
(a),
and
they
didn't.
they
said
all
of
3730.
justice
antonin
scalia
sloppy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
what
you
can
take.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
a
necessary
element
of
a
successful
action
for
retaliatory
discharge
that...
that
the
action
under
the
false
claims
act
have
succeeded?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
government
contend
is
to
be
done
under
(b)(1)
when
no
violation
of
section
3729
is
committed?
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
done
it
for
several
hundred
years,
haven't
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
all
federal
causes
of
action?
we've...
we've
looked
to
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
sloppiness.
how
about
that
as
a
reason,
sloppiness
that
appears
throughout
the
rest
of
this...
of
this
piece
of
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
do
you
know
of...
of
any
other
situation
in
which
a...
a
time
limit
is
imposed
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the...
with
the
act
that
the
individual
is
complaining
about,
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
act--
justice
antonin
scalia
--before
the
act
occurs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
time
limit
could
have
expired
before
the
act
occurs.
right?
so
you
get
free
retaliation
after
6
years.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
wait.
what
kind
of
an
equitable
doctrine?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
one
of
the
major
things
they
were
concerned
about
was
retaliation
against
witnesses
in
the
qui
tam
action,
and
that
will
always
occur
after.
i
mean,
the...
the
suit
for
retaliation
will
then
always
occur
after
the
qui
tam
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
now
saying
majority,
not
vast
majority.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait
for
the
sg.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
reading
alleged
into...
into
(b)(1).
right?
sure,
it
will
always
be
based
on
an
alleged
violation.
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
he's
saying
is
it
should
be
read
to
include
only
those
causes
of
action
under
3730
that
the
rest
of
(b)
makes
sense
as
applied
to,
just
as
in
(c)
the
phrase,
brought
under
section
3730,
should
be
interpreted
to...
to
include
only
those
causes
of
action
that
the
rest
of
that
provision
applies
to,
namely,
those...
those
actions
under
3730
that
involve
the
united
states.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think...
do
you
think
congress
is
more
likely
to
amend
3731(b)
to
say
clearly
and
non-sloppily
what
it
means
if
we
find
for
the
government
here
or
if
we
find
for
the...
i
mean,
for...
for
the
side
that
the
government
supports
or
if
we
find
for
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
about
this
as
a
general...
as
a
general
principle
of
construction?
a
court
should
not,
unless
there
is
no
reasonable
alternative,
construe
a
statute
of
limitations
provision
in
such
fashion
that
the
statute
can
expire
before
the
cause
of
action
arises?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
reasonable
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
reasonable
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
run
forward
to
create
situations
like
that,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
my...
my
point
isn't
that
it
couldn't
exist.
i
just
said
you
should
not
interpret
a
statute
of
limitations
if
it
is
reasonably
possible
to
avoid
it
in
that
fashion.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
ask
you
another
textual
question?
you...
you
want
us
to
say
that
(b)(1)
must
apply
to
all
civil
actions
under
section
3730.
must
(b)(2)
apply
to
all
civil
actions
under
3730
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that...
that
could
exclude
even
a
retaliation
action
by
an
individual
who...
who
doesn't...
who
doesn't
know
when
the...
when
the
individual...
the
official
of
the
united
states
found
out
about
those
facts.
that...
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
provision
is
very...
very
reasonable
as
applied
to
qui
tam
actions.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
any
sense
as
applied
to
a
retaliation
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
be,
but
maybe
the
united
states
found
out
before...
before
that
individual
came
forward.
maybe
there
was
an
official
in
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
he's...
you
know,
he's...
he's
out
of...
out
of
time
before
he
even
knows
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it...
but
it
would
mean
that
just
as
3731(b)(2)
can
be
selectively
applied
to
some
categories
and
not
to
others,
so
also,
by
parity
of
reasoning,
(b)(1)
can
selectively
be
applied
to
some
categories
of
violation
and
not
to
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
rest?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
would
count
that
as
being
brought
separate.
i
think
you
should
add
that
with
the
other
5.
