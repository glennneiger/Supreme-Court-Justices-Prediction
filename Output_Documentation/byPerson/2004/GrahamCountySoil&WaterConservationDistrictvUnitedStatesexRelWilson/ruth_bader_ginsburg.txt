mr.
browning,
this
argument
that
you're
making,
where
you
seem
to
be
having
great
solicitude
for
the...
for
the
whistleblowers,
for
the
people
who
might
be
retaliated
against...
the
respondent
and
the
solicitor
general
answer
your
argument
by
saying
in
all
the
years
that
3730(h)
retaliation
claims
have
been
available,
there
has
been
no
instance
of
qui
tam
plaintiff
barred
because
the
retaliation
occurred
outside
the
6
but
are
there
any
actual
cases
where
the
retaliation
in
fact
fell
outside
the
6-year,
dated
from
the
submission
of
the
false
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
they
don't
get
retaliated
against
if
they
testify
at
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
problem
out
there
in
the
real
world
on...
for
people
whose
interest
is
certainly
not
identical
to
yours.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems...
it
seems
if
you
read
a
provision
like
this,
it
says
what
the
united
states
would
be
required
to
prove.
implicit
in...
in
that
is
in
any
action
brought
by
the
united
states
under
3730.
i
think...
think
(c)
is
clearly
talking
about
cases
in
which
the
united
states
is
bringing
the
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
think
that's
at
all
as
clear
as
that
(c)
is
directed
to
cases
brought
by
the
united
states
for
the
reason
that
justice
breyer
just
explained.
congress
might
want
to
have
one
6-year
limitation
and
say,
well,
maybe
there
would
be
this
hypothetical
case
that
you're
worried
about,
but
for
the
most
part,
6
years
will
take
care
of
everybody.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
connection
with
what's
included
and
what
isn't
included,
the...
in
that
same
3731
provision
in
(d),
(d)
is
limited
to
(a)
and
(b)
and
so
excludes
(h).
and
if
congress
had
meant
that
with
respect
to
the
6-year
period,
they
could
have
said
the
same
thing,
that
it
relates
to
(a)
and
(b)
and
not
(h).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
browning,
is
it
proper
to
consider
in
the
calculus
that
if
you
use
6
years
from
the
date
the...
that
the
false
claim
was
made
or
was
alleged
to
be
made,
then
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the
question
which
state's
statute
of
limitations,
the
choice
of
law
question,
and
then
when
you
identify
that
state,
which
limitation
period
within
that
state?
i
mean,
those
are
two
inquiries
which
can
sometimes
be
rather
complicated.
they
are
obviated
entirely
if
we
take
the
6
years
from
the
federal
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
is
federal
statute.
is
there
one?
and
my
question
is
deciding
is
there
one...
this
is
not
something
drawn
from
thin
air.
there
is
a
6-year
period
right
in
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hurt,
can
you...
can
you
go
back
a
few
steps?
because
there
was
a
difference
between
an
answer
that
you
gave
and
one
that
mr.
browning
gave.
he
said
it's
a
mixed
bag,
the
litigation
of
whether
it's
brought
in
one
action
and
the
whistleblower
is
making
both
claims
or
whether
the
retaliation
claim
is
saved
out
and
brought
in
a
separate
action.
you
said
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
involve
the
whistleblower
asserting
both
claims
in
a
single
action.
which
characterization
is
right?
mixed
bag
or
vast
majority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hurt,
what...
what
about
the
argument
that
unlike
most
retaliation
situations,
here
if
you
take
that
6-year
period,
which
is
much
longer
than
the
general
run
of
retaliation
statutes
take
it,
then
you
could
have
a
qui
tam
plaintiff
who
waits
while
the
back
pay
is
mounting,
and
so
you
can
have
an
exorbitant
application
both
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
back
pay
and
the
claim
for
reinstatement.
5
years
down
the
road...
i
haven't
worked
with
this
company
now...
i'm
going
to
insist
they
take
me
back,
be
reinstated.
that...
that
concern,
that
on
your
reading
there
is
the
potential
for
much
larger
damages
and
much
more
disruptive
reinstatement
than
is
usually
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
the
point
that
the
seventh
circuit
made
clear
in...
in
its--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--statute
of
repose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
go
back
to
what
you
said.
in...
in
the
major...
whatever
it
is...
is
there
any
limitation
at
all,
or
just
the
limitation
on
the
qui
tam
and
as
here,
as
you
contend
is
so
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
that's...
that's
a
criminal
proceeding.
