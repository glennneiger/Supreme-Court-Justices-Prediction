mr.
mark
t.
hurt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
of
this
statute
could
not
be
more
clear
on
this
issue.
a
retaliation
claim
is
a
civil
action
under
section
3730,
and
a
civil
action
under
3730
is
subject
to
a
6-year
limitations
period.
petitioners
argue,
in
effect,
that
the
court
should
disregard
the
plain
language
here
and
claim
that
congress
really
meant
that
only
two
of
the
three
causes
of
action
under
section
3730,
should
be
subject
to
the
6
year
limitations
period,
those
brought
under
sections
(a)
and
(b),
and
that
congress
told
us
this
indirectly
by
changing
the
limitations
trigger...
this
simply
makes
no
sense
for
two
reasons.
first,
there
is
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
limited
the
scope
of
the
limitations
period
in
such
a
cryptic
manner.
in
paragraph
(d)
as
justice--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--well,
i...
i
would
propose
that
if
congress
really
wanted
this
trigger,
wanted
a
uniform
limitations
period,
they
really
couldn't
have
done
this
particular
provision,
(b)(1),
in
a
more
clear
way.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
the
answer
is
no,
but--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--sometimes
equitable
doctrines
might
apply,
but
the--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--for
instance,
if
the
employer
deliberately
waited
to
retaliate
until
the
6
years
has
past,
that
could
be
an
instance.
but
the
important
thing
is
the
retaliation
provision
in
the
false
claims
act
is
unique
because
it's
designed
to
be
a
companion
or
an
add-on
action
to
the
qui
tam
action.
that's...
if
you
look
at
the
reported
cases,
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases
show
the
two
actions
brought
together.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
i
believe
the
core
concern
is
to
incentivize
the
whistleblower.
but
take
that
particular
situation,
the
witness,
and
that
concern.
there
are
other
laws
and
other
causes
of
actions
that
will
protect
the
witness
in
that
situation.
for
instance,
section
1985.
this
court
in
hadel
v.
harrison
ruled
that
a
witness
who
is
retaliated
against
at
a
federal
trial
does
have
a
section
1985
action.
here,
congress
was
focusing
on
the
whistleblower,
encouraging
him
to
bring
this
qui
tam
action.
in
fact,
he's
only
protected
for
activities
that
are...
the...
the
statute
says,
in
furtherance
of
an
action
under
this
section.
that
is
pointing
to
the
qui
tam
action.
and
there's
all
kinds
of
problems
that
arise
if
these
two
actions
are
not
brought
together
if
the
retaliation
action
must
be
brought
first.
first,
if
you
accept
the
petitioner's
view,
you're
going
to
have
situations
where
as
little
as
180
days...
they
have
180
days
like
in
florida
to
bring
this
retaliation
action.
once
that's
gone,
the...
the
whistleblower
has
possibly
6
years
to
bring
this
qui
tam
action,
but
no
incentive
from
the
retaliation
action,
which
was
one
of
the--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--well,
the
sg's
office
informed
us
that
they
did
a
search
of
the
reported
cases.
in
the
majority
of
those
cases,
the...
the
claims
were
brought
together.
the
sg,
i
think,
can
give
you
the
details
on
that.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
okay.
i
think
it--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--but
they
point
out...
they
realized,
i
think,
petitioners,
that
this
is
a
problem
that...
that
this
is
a
unique
act,
and
they...
and
they
point
out...
they
make
the
claim
that
the
major
fraud
act
somehow
renders
this
not
unique.
that's
a
criminal
statute
and
it
doesn't
have
a
qui
tam
action.
every
retaliation
claim
is
going
to
be
based
in
part
on
an
alleged
violation
of
section
3729.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
well,
no.
i
think
that
ignores
how
statute
of
limitations
are
actually
construed
by
courts.
you
can
write
a
statute
basically
two
ways.
you
can
put
the
violation
as
the
trigger
or
you
can
put
the
act,
alleged
to
be
a
violation.
courts
apply
those
identically.
and
for
instance,
if
you
have
a
summary
judgment
motion
by
a
qui
tam...
qui
tam
defendant,
which
we
always
agree
that
this
statute
(b)(1)
applies,
all
the
defendant
has
to
do
is
point
out
the
act
alleged
to
be
a
false
claim
falls
outside
of
the
6-year
period,
and
he
wins.
he
doesn't
have...
no
one
has
to
show
whether
the
actual
claim
itself
was
false
or
not.
so
i
think,
you
know,
as
justice
breyer
points
out,
this
is
the
way
you
universally
construe
statute
of
limitations.
having
the
same
trigger
for
all
three
3730
actions
means
the
limitations
period
starts
for
all
three
at
the
same
time.
this
makes
it
easier
for
the
whistleblower
to
bring
both
their
qui
tam
and
retaliation
actions
together.
if
she's
forced
to
bring
the
retaliation
action
first,
then
if
she
misses
that,
then
she's
got
no
incentive
to
then
go
on
and
bring
the
qui
tam
action
from
the...
the
incentive
from
this
whistleblower
action,
which
is
the
key
purpose
of
it.
also,
if
she
has
to
bring
the...
the
retaliation
action
first
before
the
qui
tam
action,
then
what
will
happen,
if
she's
not
ready
to
bring
the
qui
tam
action...
these
can
be
very
complicated
allegations,
complicated
defense
contract...
then
what
will
happen
is
she
will
most
likely
have
to
split
her
claim.
and
that
exposes
the
whistleblower
to
all
kinds
of...
of
pitfalls.
for
instance--
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
--i
think
that
that
type
of
situation
is
just
so
highly
unlikely.
it
doesn't
really
comport
with
the
realities
of
what
whistleblowers
are
thinking
about.
for
instance,
in
this
case,
ms.
wilson
didn't
come
forward
until
she
saw
no
one
else
would
come
forward
and
remedy
what
she
saw
as
theft
from
the
u.s.
government.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
i
think
that...
i
think
there's
a
split
in
the
lower
courts
about
how
the
mitigation
will
apply.
mr.
mark
t.
hurt
i
think
that...
that
that
is
a
possible
case,
but
i
think
that
that's...
the
priorities
for
the
government
and...
and
congress
in
drafting
this
law
was
to
get
money
back
for
the
government.
that's
their
number
one
concern
here
and
to
incentivize
that
whistleblower.
if
it
so
happens
that
the
whistleblower
takes
much...
takes
a
long
time
to
prepare
his
qui
tam
and
brings
his...
his
retaliation
action
at
the
same
time
and
ends
up
getting
some
more
damages,
i...
i
think
that
ranks
low
on
the
list
of
congress'priorities
in
drafting
this
retaliation
provision.
it's
the...
getting
the
government's
money
back,
giving
the
whistleblower
protection
and
an
incentive
to
bring
that
qui
tam
claim
is
really
congress'core
concern
here.
and
i
think
these
other
issues
about
damages
mounting
can
be
readily
addressed
with
the
mitigation
defense
and...
and
dealing
with
that
that
will
take
care
of
double
damages
so...
so
if
the
whistleblower
is
just
sitting
around
waiting
for
that,
then
the
mitigation
defense
would
take
care
of
that.
also,
i
think
the
petitioner
raised
the
idea
that
this
is
some
kind
of...
the...
the
retaliator
can
bring
some
kind
of
nebulous
fraud
allegation
if
it
doesn't...
isn't
really
tied
to
a
specific
false
claim.
i
think
that
the
courts
are
not
interpreting
it
that
way
because
this
is
a
false
claims
act
retaliation
claim,
not
just
a
generalized
fraud
claim.
so
in
a
typical
case,
there
will
be
a
claim
that...
that
the
whistleblower
will...
will
be
able
to
point
to
and
say
i
think
that
this
claim
is
false.
i
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
it
is
false,
and
then
it...
and
that's
what
the
trigger
would
be
based
on.
i
mean,
in
summary,
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
just
summarize.
i
think
this
court
should
uphold
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
while
the
limitations
trigger
is
unusual,
it
is
the
one
that
congress
set
forth
in
the
statute.
it
makes
sense.
it
reflects
the
unique
considerations
of
encouraging...
the
goal
of
encouraging
a
whistleblower
to
bring
his
qui
tam
claim
with
his
retaliation
claim.
19
years
of
experience
have
shown
that
the
plain
language
works
in
the
typical
cases
that
arise,
and
that
none
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
petitioners
come
close
to
providing
a
justification
for
this
court
to
discard
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
none
of
the
reasons...
this
statute
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
absurdity
that
would
justify
this
court
disregarding
the
plain
language.
thank
you.
