justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
all
that's
true,
but
the
question
that
i
think
justice
ginsburg
asked
was
you
have
on
your
side
the
whole
national
defense
industrial
association.
you
have
the
equal
employment
advisory
council
that
represents
dozens
and
dozens,
i
take
it,
of
businesses.
we
have
your
own
client.
we
have
you
in
the
firm.
everybody.
i
imagine
you
all
racked
your
brains
to
say
has
there
ever
been
such
an
example,
and
i
take
the
answer
is
no,
never.
not
all
of
you
could
even
find
one
instance
where
this
happened.
now,
am
i
right?
because
that's
what
i
think
unless
you
provide
the
example.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so...
so
what
would
be
so
unreasonable
about
a
member
of
congress
concluding
the
following?
we
want
these
things
to
end
after
6
years,
you
know?
and
there's
never
been
an
example
of
this
horrible
that
you
think
of,
and
so
we
are
going
to
end
them
all
after
6
years
from
the
time
the
thing
took
place,
the
cheat
took
place.
and
that's
it.
and
if
there's
some
other
problem
of
the
kind
you're
worried
about
that
comes
up,
we
will
worry
about
that
later
through
amendment,
tolling,
et
cetera.
why
is
that
an...
we
don't
want
30
day
statutes
of
limitations
or
90-day
statute
of
limitations.
we
want
6
years.
that
helps
most
people.
and
if
there's
an
odd
case
that
doesn't,
we'll
worry
about
it.
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
true,
it
would
be.
and
the
reason
we're
doing
it
is
because
there's
a
period
of
time
when
somebody
lies
to
the
government
and
we
don't
want
actions
that
are
related
to
that.
we'll
have
to
go
into
that
proof
to
take
place
more
than
6
years
later.
now,
that
would
be
the
reason,
and
i
agree
it
would
be
contrary.
but
the
difficulty
for
me
is
the
language
seems
to
point
to
that
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
can't
find
that
reason
idiotic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
don't
we
have
to
do
that
anyway
when...
when
in
fact
a
person
brings
an
ordinary
claim?
i
mean,
joe
smith
brings
a
claim
that
xyz
company
cheated
the
government.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
it
was
committed.
it
just
means
he
says
it
was
committed.
after
all,
he
might
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
if
in
fact
the
plaintiff
loses
because
the
jury
finds
for
the
defendant
in
the
qui
tam
action,
then
it
should
have
been
dismissed
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
of
course
not
because...
because
the
word
is
committed
there
refers
to
the
claim
of
a
plaintiff.
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
an
action
of
ejectment,
an
action
of
ejectment
that
arises
only
after
the
adverse
possession
statute
of
limitations
have
run?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
it
is
right.
