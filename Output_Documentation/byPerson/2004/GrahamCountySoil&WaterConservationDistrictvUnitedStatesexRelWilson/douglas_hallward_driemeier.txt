mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
3731(b)
provides
the
statute
of
limitations
for,
quote,
a
civil
action
under
section
3730.
there
is
no
question
that
ms.
wilson's
claim
of
retaliation
is
a
claim
under
section
3730.
petitioner
asks
the
court
to
construe
section
3731(b)
to
include
an
implicit
limitation
to
claims
under
subsections
(a)
or
(b)--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--section
3731(c)
does
not
require,
in
its
application,
the
court
to
construe
a
civil
action
under
section
3730
to
mean
anything
other
than
what
its
words
import
because
it
only
relates
to
the
united
states'
burden
of
proof.
the
petitioner
suggested
that
it
implicitly
was
limited
to
an
action
under
3730(a).
well,
that's
certainly
not
true
because
if...
if
an
action
is
brought
under
3730(b)
and
the
united
states
intervenes,
section
3731(c)
establishes
the
standard
of
proof.
if
congress
were
to
amend
section
3730(h)
to
allow
the
united
states
to
bring
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
employee
who
was
retaliated
against,
section
3731(c)
would,
by
its
terms,
establish
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
united
states
would
have
to
meet.
so
there
is
no
inconsistency
there.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
3731(b)
is
capable
of
application
exactly
as
written,
and
in
fact,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
that
that
is
the
statute
of
limitations
which
most
serves
the
purposes
of
the
statute
unlike
the
alternative
the
petitioner--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--no,
sir.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
there
are
any--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--many
states
have
adopted
statutes
of
repose,
and
they
apply
to
a
cause
of
action
that
under
state
law
accrues
for
purposes
of
statute
of
limitations
upon
the
discovery
of
the
injury.
but
a
statute
of
repose
can
come
in
and
instead
tied
to
the
act,
say,
for
instance,
in
which
the
date
that
a
product
was
first
sold
into
the
market.
and
so
the
cause
of
action,
for
purposes
of
statute
of
limitations,
will
not
arise
in
many
instances
until
after
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run
because
of
a
statute
of
repose.
so
that
it's
certainly
not
unheard
of
in
the
law.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
there--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there
other
examples
of...
of
cases
in
which
the
time
in
which
a
claim
can
be
brought
may
have
expired
before
the
cause
of
action
accrues.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
in
the
bay
area
laundry
case
and
in
the
reiter
case,
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
there
is
a
general
rule
that
statutes
of
limitations
start
to
run
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues.
but
in
each
of
those
case...
cases,
the
court
was
very
clear
that
that
was
the
rule
that
applied
in
the
absence
of
contrary
indication
by
congress.
and
here
we
have
a
very
explicit
contrary
indication
by
congress,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
any
civil
action
under
section
3730
runs
from
the
date
on
which
the
violation
of
section
3729
was
committed.
in
other
words,
congress
has
opted
here
to
establish
a
single
uniform
statute
of
limitations
for
all
claims
that
might
arise
under
the
false
claims
act.
and
as
i
said
before,
that
serves
the
purposes
of
the
false
claims
act
better,
far
better
certainly,
than
petitioner's
alternative.
as
we
have
pointed
out,
many
state
statutes
of
limitations,
assuming
that
one
can
determine
which
one
applies
of
the
many
that
might
be
offered,
are
much
shorter
than
the
statute
provided
for
bringing
the
qui
tam
action.
as
a
practical
matter,
then
an
employee
might
be
forced
to
split
their
claims.
if
they
split
their
claims,
any
number
of
adverse
consequences
follow.
first,
they
could
find
themselves
barred
from
bringing
a
subsequent
qui
tam
action
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
by
the
public
disclosure
bar
of
the
false
claims
act.
the
eleventh
circuit
has
a
rule
that
says
that
the
two
claims
are
one
for
purposes
of
res
judicata.
so
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
apparently
they
could
be
barred
by
res
judicata
from
bringing
a
qui
tam
action.
the
disclosures
in
the
course
of
the
wrongful
termination
of
retaliation
claim
action
would,
of
course,
alert
the
defendant
to
the
scope
and
extent
of
any
government
investigation.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
oftentimes
the
employer
fires
the
employee
as
soon
as
the
employer
has
a
sense
that
the
employee
is
on
to
something.
he
doesn't
have
a
full
knowledge
of
what
the
employee
knows
and
certainly
doesn't
know
that
the
employee
might
have
told
the
government
and
that
the
government
is
investigating.
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
under
seal
requirement
of
the
false
claims
act,
to
allow
the
government
to
conduct
a
full
investigation
of
the
claim,
talk
to
other
employees
about
what
was
going
on.
sometimes
the
employee
really
has
identified
fraud,
but
may
only
have
identified
a
portion
of
the
larger
scheme
of
fraud
that's
going
on.
and
the
government
gets
to
investigate
that
while
the
claim
is
under
seal.
but
in
the
course
of
discovery
in
any
wrongful
termination
suit
or
retaliation
suit,
all
of
that
information
would
become
available
to
the
employer.
and
so
the
sealed
provisions
of
the
fca
would
be
defeated
in
large
extent.
there's
also
the
fact
of
just
the
litigation
efficiencies
of
litigating
the
two
claims
together.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--will
be
the
same.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
the...
the
most
close
reading
of
the
text
would
be
that
any
civil
action
under
3730
can
be
brought
within
3
years
of
when
the
official
of
the
united
states...
now,
we
differ
from
the
ninth
circuit
on
this.
we
believe
that
is
only
a
government
official,
in
particular
a
department
of
justice
official...
knows
of
the
facts
relevant
to
bringing
a
cause
of
action
that
the
united
states
could
bring,
i.
e.,
the
cause
of
action
under
3730(a).
but
we
think
that
3
years
from
that
date
in
the
action
under
3730
could
be
brought,
including
the
qui
tam
action
or
including
a
retaliation
action.
but
that
reading
is
not
essential
to
the
position
that
we
advocate
here.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
of
course--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
it...
it
does
make
sense
applying
it
to
a
retaliation
action
because
it
could
be,
for
instance,
the
employee
who
was
the
individual
who
informed
the
government
official
charged
with
responsibility
to
act
of
the
facts
that
would
warrant
the
united
states
in
filing
an
action
under
3730(a).
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's...
that's
possible.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
there
may
be
events
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there
may
be
instances
where
the
employee
would
not
know
that
they
could
take
advantage
of
that
provision.
but
in
the
bay
area
laundry
case,
the
court
considered
and
rejected
a
virtually
identical
argument.
that
case...
the
statute
of
limitations
also
was
stated
in
the
alternative,
and
the
second
one
was
3
years
after
the
information
necessary
to
the
claim
had
arrived.
and
the
party
who
was
opposed
to
the
position
the
court
ultimately
adopted
said
that
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
first
of
the
two
alternatives
would
render
the
second
superfluous.
and
the
court
said,
it
may
be
superfluous
to
this
category
of
claims,
but
it's
not
superfluous
to
other
categories
of
claims,
and
so
that
does
not
prevent
us
from
construing
the
first
provision
in
the
way
that
we
are.
so
likewise,
even
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
3731(b)(2)
is
unavailable
to
a
retaliation
claim
or
unavailable
to
a
qui
tam
claim,
as
some
courts
of
appeals
have
held,
it
would
not
mean
that
3731(b)(1)
is
unavailable,
just
as
holding
that
3731(b)(2)
is
unavailable
to
a
qui
tam
relator
would
not
mean
that
3731(b)(1)
is
unavailable
to
a
qui
tam
relator.
a
couple
of
justices,
justice
souter--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
again,
we
believe
that
the
best,
most
faithful
reading
of
the
text
is
that
(b)(2)
is
available
to
all
causes
of
action
under
3730.
the...
justice
souter
asked
a
question
about
statistics
and
the
frequency
with
which
the
claims
are
litigated
together.
in
a
review
of
court
of
appeals
decisions,
there
were
51
court
of
appeals
decisions
actually
involving
a
3730(h)
claim.
of
those,
in
32
the
qui
tam...
a
qui
tam
claim
and
a
retaliation
claim
were
paired.
they
were
litigated
together.
in
only
5
were
both
a
qui
tam
action
and
retaliation
claim
brought,
but
brought
in
separate
litigation.
so
32
to
5
is
the
relevant
comparison
there.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
in...
in--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--14
claims
an
individual
brought
a
retaliation
claim
but
never
brought
a
qui
tam
suit.
it
may
be
that
the
government
had--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
in...
in
fact,
if
we...
if
we
look
more
closely
at
those
14
cases,
5
of
them
were
dismissed
because
the
plaintiff
was
not
even
involved
in
protected
conduct
under
the
statute.
so
the
closer
you
get
to
the
core
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
when
it
enacted
the
statute,
of...
of
pulling
out
employees
who
have
the
information
that
only
they
have
that
the
government
needs
in
order
to
recover
fraud,
the
closer
you
get
to
that
core,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
the
claims
that
are
going
to
be
litigated
together.
and
that's
the
way
the
court
ought
to
apply
the
statute.
it's
the
way
congress
wrote
the
statute,
to
serve
those
purposes.
the...
i...
i
think
that
the
alternative
of
applying
state
statutes
of
limitations
raises...
north
carolina
does
not
dispute
that,
for
example,
in
florida
the...
the
analogous
statute
of
limitations
under
florida
law...
it's
the
florida
state
false
claims
act
which
has
a
retaliation
provision...
would
be
180
days.
180
days
is
far
too
short
to
put
together
the
complicated
qui
tam
complaint
that
is
called
for
under
the
false
claims
act.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
florida
may
have
made
an
alternative
policy
decision
in
terms
of
wanting
the
claims
to
be
litigated
together
or
apart.
the
congress
has
established
a
single
uniform
statute
of
limitations
which
allows
the
claims
to
be
litigated
together,
and
as
i've
said,
that
is
in
fact
the
practice
that
when
someone
is
going
to
bring
a
qui
tam
action,
they
almost
invariably...
there...
there
are
5
exceptions...
bring
the
cases
together.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
