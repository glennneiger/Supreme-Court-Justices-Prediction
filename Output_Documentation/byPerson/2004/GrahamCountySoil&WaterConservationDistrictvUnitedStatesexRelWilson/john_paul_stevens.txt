justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i...
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt,
but
it
is
true
that
this
is
a
civil
action
that's
brought
under
3730(h),
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
literally
within
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
true,
but
is
it
also
not
true
that
some
of
the
people
who
get
retaliated
against
may
be
the
same
people
who
bring
the
qui
tam
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
they
don't
get
the...
recover
as
being
the
victim
of
retaliation,
they
may
still
get
a
very
handsome
reward
for
what
happened
to
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
alternative?
if
we
don't
follow
this
statute,
you...
you
refer
to
state
law
for
the
correct
cause...
statute
of
limitations
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
imagine
because
there
are
different
forms
of
retaliation...
sometimes
it's
a
discharge,
sometimes
it
might
be
slander
by
defaming
the
person
for
his
next
employer,
it
might
be
a
tort,
they
beat
him
up
or
something,
there
could
be
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
retaliation...
each
of
which
would
give
rise
to
a
different
statute
of
limitations
under
state
law.
does
that
seem
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
had
to
make
up
a
rule
to
fill
a
gap.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
about
wisconsin,
michigan,
illinois,
and...
and
florida?
maybe
they
all
have
different
statutes
and
they
have
different
kinds
of
causes
of
action
that
may
be
relevant
in
the
retaliation
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
our
construction
of
the
statute,
we
have
to
think
about
its
application
throughout
the
united
states,
not
just
in
north...
north
carolina.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
there's
no
violation,
then
there's
no
triggering
event
to
start
the
statute
of
limitations
running.
