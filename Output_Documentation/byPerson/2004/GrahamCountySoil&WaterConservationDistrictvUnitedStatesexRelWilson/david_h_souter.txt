in
the
real
world,
do
we
have
such
cases?
justice
david

another
real-world
question.
do
we...
do
we
have
any...
do
you
have
any
experience
that
you
can
rely
on
either
to
show
that
in
fact
these
subsection
(h)
claims
are
brought
customarily
with
the
main
qui
tam
action
or,
conversely,
that
they
are
brought
separately?
do
we
know
what's
going
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
isn't
justice
ginsburg's
question
raised
by
your
very
argument,
that
you
don't
want
whistleblowers
having
to
bring
their
whistleblower
actions
before
they
are
ready
to
bring
their
main
actions?
and
if
it's
going
to
take...
you've
just
said
how
difficult
it
may
be
to
prepare
one
of
these
qui
tam
cases.
if
in
fact
you're
right
and
it
may
take
a
couple
of
years
from
the
time
the
employer
gets
wind
that
something
is
going
on
and
fires
or
does
whatever,
then
in
exactly
that
situation,
the...
the
whistleblower
damages
are
going
to
be
mounting
during
that
period
of
1
or
2
or
whatever
years
it
may
be
before
the
qui
tam
action
starts.
so
on
your
hypothesis,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
going
to
get
just
the
situation
that
justice
ginsburg
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's...
let's
first
see
about
your
argument.
isn't
that
what
your
argument
implies?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he's
already
alerted
to
the
extent
that
he's
taking
retaliatory
action
as
true.
he
may
not
whole...
know
the...
the
whole
extent
of...
of
what
the
employee
knows,
but
he's
already
been
tipped
off.
