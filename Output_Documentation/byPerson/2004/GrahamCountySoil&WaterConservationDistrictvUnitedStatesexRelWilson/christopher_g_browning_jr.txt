mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
expressly
provided
for
a
limitations
period
for
a
retaliatory
discharge
action
under
the
federal
false
claims
act.
the
6-year
limitation
period
set
out
in
section
3731(b)
of
the
act
is
tied
to
a
violation
of
section
3729,
that
is,
the
submission
of
a
fraudulent
claim
to
the
government.
the
triggering
event
to
start
the
statute
of
limitations
running
under
section
3731(b)
is
a
violation
of
section
3729.
because
a
violation
of
section
3729
is
not
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action
for
retaliatory
discharge,
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
a
limitations
period
in
section
3731(b)
for
a
retaliatory
discharge
action.
the
government
in
its
amicus
brief
argues
that
congress
must
have
intended
a
uniform
limitation
period
so
that
all
three
actions
created
by
the
false
claims
act
could
be
brought
in
the
same
proceeding.
the...
the
government's
argument
undermines
the
very
purpose
of
the
federal
false
claims
act
and
the
retaliatory
discharge
provision.
the
retaliatory
discharge
provision,
section
3730(h)
of
the
false
claims
act,
not
only
protects
people
who
blow
the
whistle,
the
initial
whistleblower,
but
it
expressly
protects
people
who
testify
at
trial.
and
we
have
seen
time
and
again
in
many
of
these
cases
the
government
will
keep
a
case
under
seal
for
5,
6,
7
years.
we've
seen
repeatedly
situations,
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
underlying
violation
of
the
false
claim,
that
it
might
take
a
decade
from
when
the
complaint
is
filed
to
when
the
case
actually
is
put
before
a
jury.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
i
cannot
cite
to
a
specific
situation
where
that
has
occurred,
and
the
government,
you're
right,
makes
very
much
of
the
argument
that
this
is
simply
hypothetical.
but
it
is
a
very
real
and
concrete
problem
when
you
have
cases
that
go
to
trial,
that
it
takes
so
long
to
go
to
trial,
and
those
people
who
are
testifying
at
trial
have
no
protection
because
it'
s
more
than
6
years
from
the
violation
of
section
3729.
i...
i
would--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
recognize
that,
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
to
construe
it
in
its
proper
context.
and
there
are
many
situations
where
there...
a
number
of
years
pass
from...
from
when
the
complaint
is
filed
to
when
the
testimony
takes
place
at
trial.
and...
and
as
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
work
right
institute
points
out,
an
organization
that's
designed
to
protect
the
human
rights
of
employees,
an
organization
that's
a
spin-off
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
that
organization
clearly
views
the
interpretation
advocated
by
the
respondents
and
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit
as
detrimental
by
employees.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
i
cannot
cite
a
specific
example.
justice
breyer,
i
would
direct
your
attention
to
the
case
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
childray
v.
uapga,
in
which
4-and-a-half
years
had
passed
between
when
the
initial
allegation
of--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
if
congress
had
said
that,
they
certainly
could
have
made
that
decision,
but
it
would
run
completely
contrary
to
almost
200
years
of
precedent
from
this
court
that
as
a
general
rule,
the
limitations
period
does
not
begin
to
run
before
your
cause
of
action
even
comes
into
existence.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well
i--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
think
the
language
points
to
that
because
the
language
of
the
limitations
period,
3731(b),
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
at
page
135a...
the
language
of
the
statute
is
a
civil
action
under
section
3730
may
not
be
brought
more
than
6
years
after
the
date
of
the
violation
of
section
3729.
there
are
two
material
aspects
of...
of
the
statutory
language:
the
violation
of
section
3729,
which
is
not
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--the...
the
action
is
brought
under
3730(h),
and
justice
stevens--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
it
is
and
it
isn't.
it
is
clearly
in
3730(h),
but
when
you
look
at
the
false
claims
act,
congress
has
used
the
phrase,
an
action
under
3730,
to
mean
different
things
in
various
portions
throughout
the
false
claims
act.
congress
has
used
that
phrase
on
six
different
occasions,
and
i
would
particularly
direct
the
court's
attention
to
3731(c).
in...
in
that
provision,
congress
has
provided
that
in
an
action
brought
under
section
3730,
the
united
states
must
prove
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
respondent
and
the
government
say
you
must
have
this
little
reading
of
section...
the
phrase,
an
action
under
3730,
and
it
means
all
three
causes
of
action
in
3731(b),
but
that...
but
when
you
turn
to
3731(c),
that
virtually
identical
phrase
appears
and
you
have
to
read
that
statutory
provision
in
context,
and
read
in
context--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--exactly,
justice
ginsburg.
you
have
to
read
it
in
context,
and
i
think
when
you
read
3731(b)
in
context
and
that
limitations
period
is
tied
to
a
violation
of
section
3729,
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
phrase,
an
action
under
3730,
to...
to
include
a
retaliatory
discharge
action
in
which
a
violation
of
section--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--and,
justice
ginsburg,
my
point
is
just
as
section
3731(c)
is
not
intended
to
cover
all
of
the
causes
of
action
under
the
false
claims
act,
3731(b)
is
not
intended
to
cover
all
of
the
actions
under
the
false
claims
act
as
well,
that
it's
only
intended
to
cover
the
causes
of
action
in
which
a
violation
of
section
3729
is
an
element
of
the
cause
of
action.
the...
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
you
need
a
uniform
limitations
period
so
these
actions
can
be
tried
together,
but
the
government
ignores
the
fact
that
a
qui
tam
action
or
an
action
brought
by
the
government
is
a
completely
different
cause
of
action
than
an
action
for
retaliatory
discharge
action.
they
involve
different
substantive
claims.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
in
some
cases,
that
is...
is
the
case,
justice--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--that
is
the
case,
but...
but
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
in
many
cases,
the
person
who
brings
the
qui
tam
action
is
a
completely
different
plaintiff
than
the
person
who
brings
the
retaliatory
discharge
action.
the
example
of
someone
who
is
retaliated
against
for
testifying
at
trial...
in
that
situation,
it's
clearly
going
to
be
a
different
plaintiff
than
the
plaintiff
who
brought
the
original
qui
tam
action.
it
can
also
be
a
different
defendant.
section
3730(h)
is
intended
to
preclude
an
industry
from
blacklisting
an
employee.
so
if
an
employee
brings
a
qui
tam
action
while
at
one
employer
and
subsequently
leaves
and
go
to...
goes
to
work
for
a
second
employer,
when
the
second
employer
recognizes
or...
or
learns
that
this
employee
had
previously
been
involved
in
an
investigation
under
the
false
claims
act,
that
second
employer
is
precluded
from
retaliating
against
the...
the
employee.
so--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
i
cannot
cite
to
a
specific
case,
but
i'm
aware
that
that
is
very
much
a
issue
that
practitioners
face
day
in
and
day
out.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
real
mix,
that
on
many
cases
you
will
see
a
retaliatory
discharge
action
brought
independently,
and
in
other
cases
you'll
see
the
qui
tam
action
and
the
retaliation
action
brought
simultaneously.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
recognize
that
there
is
different
language
that
congress
could
have...
have
chosen
to
state
this
in
a
different
way,
but...
and
you're
right,
that
in
section
3731(d),
congress
did
specifically
reference
section
3730(a)
and
3730(b),
but
congress
did
not
use
that
precision
in
drafting
throughout
the
federal
false
claims
act.
just...
there
are
a
number
of
ambiguities
that
exist
throughout
the
federal
false
claims
act.
congress
even
referred
to
the
general
accounting
office
as
the
government
accounting
office.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
3730(a),
justice
scalia.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
so...
so
all
you
can
really
take
from
the
statute
is
that
the
phrase--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
context.
you
have
to
look
at
the
meaning,
and
when
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
is
drafted
in
a
way
that's
sloppy,
you
have
to
look
at
what
congress
really
intended,
and
when
congress--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
faced
that
situation
with
1983
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
and
there
are
a
number
of--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--and...
and
in
north
carolina
it's
easy.
it
is
basically
a
3-year
statute
of
limitations
for
everything.
and
for
a
retaliatory
discharge
action,
you
look
at
the...
in
north
carolina,
you
look
at
the
limitations
period
for--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
is
certainly
an
issue.
with
respect
to
the
parties
in
this
case,
that
is
a
matter
that
is
clear
and
simple
because
north
carolina
you
look
to
a
retaliatory
discharge
action--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
and
a
rule
that
would
apply
the
residual
limitation
period
for
personal
injury
would
certainly
be
appropriate
for
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
for
a
retaliatory
discharge
action,
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
a
violation
of
section
3729.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
the
way
i
read
the
government's
brief
is
they
want
to
modify
the
language
of
section
3731(b)
by
inserting
the
phrase
alleged
before
the
phrase,
violation
of
section
3729.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
but...
but,
justice
breyer,
when
the
jury
renders
its
verdict,
if
there
is
a
violation
of
section
3729
that's
proven
to
exist,
but
that...
that
proven
violation
is
beyond
the
6-year
period,
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
judgment
based
upon
the
affirmative--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--what
i'm...
what
i'm
saying
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
that
are
ultimately
proven
at
trial,
and
if
the
fact
of
the
violation
is
more
than
6
years
from
the
filing
of
the
cause
of
action,
clearly
that's
going
to
be
barred
by
the
limitations
period.
the
word
alleged
does
not
appear
in
the
statute,
and
the
government
tries
to...
they
essentially
confuse
the
issue
by
saying,
well,
you...
you
could
never...
a
defendant
could
never
prevail
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
allegations
for
a
motion
to
dismiss.
but
that's
the
very
nature--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
that...
that's
the
real
problem,
that
even
under
the
government's
reading,
that
there
is
not
a
triggering
event.
so
when
you
look
at
3731(b)
as
a
whole,
when
you
try
to
discern
congressional
intent,
congress
intended
a...
the
triggering
event
to
be
a
violation
of
section
3729
which
doesn't
apply
to
a
retaliatory
discharge
action.
your
honor,
the...
the
statute
here
is
worded
in
such
a
way
that
throughout
the
federal
false
claims
act,
there
are
a
variety
of
ambiguities,
but
when
you
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
when
you
look
at
the
stated
purpose
that
congress
had
of
protecting
people
who
testify
at
trial,
there
is
only
one
way
to
read
the
statute
in
a
way
that's
harmonious,
and
that's
to
read
it
so
that
3731(b)
only
applies
to
section
3730(a)
and
3730(b)--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
you're
absolutely
right,
that
if
the
respondents'
and
the
fourth
circuit's
reading
of
the
statute
is
correct,
that
congress
did
intend
this
bizarre
result
to
take
place
for
all
three
causes
of
action,
then
you
don't
have
to
look
to
a
state
law
cause
of
action
to
fill
the
gap.
but
there
are
many
circumstances
where
this
court
has
recognized
that
you
do...
when
congress
has
not
expressly
provided
a
limitations
period,
the
most
appropriate
vehicle
is
to
look
to
the
most
closely
analogous
state
law
cause
of
action.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
comparable
situations
here
is
erisa.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
when...
when--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--there...
there
is
a
6-year
period
and
if
that
is
applied
by
this
court
to
a
retaliatory
discharge
action,
there
will
still
be
difficulties
because
you
will
have
situations
where
there
is
no
violation
of
section
3729.
so
when
do
you
start
the
limitations
period
running?
the
respondent
would
argue
in
their
brief
that
you
start
it
running
from
when
they
believed
that
the
violation
took
place.
so
your...
the
respondent
is
arguing
you're
looking
to
the
mental
impression
of
the
litigant
that
would
be
the
triggering
device
for
the
limitations
period.
your
honor,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
thank
you.
the
government
argues
that
there
will
be
problems
that
will
arise
from
splitting
the
qui
tam
action
and
the
retaliatory
discharge
action.
and
one
of
the
examples
that
the
government
use...
uses
is
the
public
disclosure
doctrine
which
is
set
out
in
section
3730(e)(4)(a)
of
the
false
claims
act.
the
public
disclosure
doctrine,
however,
is
a
red
herring
here
because
the
public
disclosure
doctrine
is
designed
to
keep...
to
avoid
parasitic
lawsuits
where
information
is
in
the...
the
public
domain,
somebody
taking
that
information,
and
then
filing
a...
a
qui
tam
lawsuit.
the...
the
public
disclosure
doctrine,
3730(e)(4)(a),
also
provides
that
when
someone
is
the
original
source
of
the
information,
even
if
the
basis
for
the
lawsuit
has
been
made
public
through
a
congressional
hearing
or
elsewhere,
that
person
can
still
bring
an
action
if
they're
an
original
source.
so
it's
a
complete
red
herring
here.
the
other
red
herring
that
was
put
forth
is
a
statement
that
there's
a
rule
in
the
eleventh
circuit
relating
to
claims
splitting.
and
forgive
me,
i
cannot
recall
the
name
of
the
case
that
the
government
is
referring
to,
but
it
is
a
decision
by
james
c.
hill.
and
that
specific
case
involved
a
situation
where
the
qui
tam
action
was
brought,
a
settlement
was
reached,
and
then
well
after
the
fact,
the
plaintiff
said,
oh,
and
i
have
this
retaliation
claim.
it
makes
perfect
sense
in
that
situation
to...
to
apply
principles
of
res
judicata.
what
the
government
is
ignoring
is
there
are
no
reported
decisions
anywhere
a
retaliatory
discharge
action
was
brought
and
then
res
judicata
was
used
to
bar
the
qui
tam
action
filed
at
a
later
date.
and
there's
a
perfectly
logical
reason
for
that
because
they
are
different
causes
of
action,
and
they
involve
different
parties.
a
retaliation
claim
is
personal
to
the
individual.
a
qui
tam
action
is
an
action
brought
on
behalf
of
the
government.
one
final
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
the
false
claims
act
is
unique.
well,
it's
not
unique.
it's
not
unique
in
that
when
you
look
at
the
major
fraud
act,
there
is
a
retaliatory
discharge
provision
that
is
virtually
identical
to
the
false
claims
act,
and
in
the
major
frauds
act...
with
respect
to
the
major
fraud
act,
congress
made
a...
a
conscious
decision
not
to
include
an
express
limitations
period.
it's
not...
the
false
claim
act
is
also
not
unique
when
you
compare
it
to
erisa.
erisa--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--the
major
fraud
act
is
a
criminal
provision
that
provides
a
retaliatory
discharge
provision
for
anyone
who
assists
the
government
in
bringing
the
criminal
prosecution.
there...
there...
in
the
major
fraud
act,
there
is
a
specific
limitations
period
of
7
years
in
which
the
prosecution
has
to
be
brought
by
the
united
states.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
but...
but
there
is...
it...
but
the
criminal
statute
provides
for
a
civil
remedy
for
a
retaliatory
discharge,
and
with
respect
to
that
retaliatory
discharge
provision
in
the
major
fraud
act,
there
is
no
limitations
provision.
one
other
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
false
claims
act
is
not...
not
unique
when
you
compare
it
to
erisa.
erisa
is
a
statute
that
has
essentially
a
retaliatory
discharge
provision
as
well
in
section
510
of
erisa,
29
u.s.c.
1140.
and
courts...
the
federal
courts
have
consistently
held
that
there
is
no
express
limitations
period
for
section
510,
so
we
have
to
look
to
the
limitations
period
under
the
most
closely
analogous
state
law
cause
of
action.
on
the
other
hand,
erisa
has
numerous
provisions,
numerous
other
aspects
of
the
statute,
that
do
have
a
limitations
period.
the
limitations
period
for
an
action
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
a
6-year
period
with
a
3-year
tolling
provision.
so
erisa
is
a
prime
example
of
a
statute
where
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
when
you
have
a
retaliatory
discharge
provision,
not
to
apply
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
that
you
look
to
state
law,
even
though
that
federal
statute
in
other
aspects
has
other
limitations
provisions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
rely
upon
our
briefs.
