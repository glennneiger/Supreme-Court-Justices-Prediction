justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
false
claims
act
prohibits
submitting
false
claims
for
payment
to
the
us
government.
it
also
prohibits
employers
from
retaliating
against
employees
who
assist
the
government
in
investigating
or
prosecuting
false
claims
actions
and
gives
employees
a
private
cause
of
action
as
a
remedy.
the
question
we
decide
is
whether
the
six
year
statute
of
limitations
in
the
false
claims
act
applies
to
such
retaliation
actions
or
whether
instead
the
most
closely
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations
applies?
this
case
began
when
respondent
karen
t.
wilson
brought
a
false
claims
act
retaliation
action
against
petitioner,
graham
county
soil
and
water
conservation
district,
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
north
carolina.
she
alleged
that
county
officials
retaliated
against
her
for
aiding
in
a
federal
investigation
whether
county
officials
and
others
had
made
false
claims
to
the
united
states.
the
district
court
concluded
that
wilson's
action
was
time
barred
because
it
was
outside
the
3-year
statute
of
limitations
specified
by
north
carolina
law.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court's
ruling.
it
held
that
the
false
claims
act's
longer
6-year
statute
of
limitations
governed
wilson's
retaliations
action
rather
than
the
shorter
state
statute
of
limitations.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
if
no
federal
statute
of
limitations
expressly
governs
a
federal
cause
of
action,
we
generally
borrow
the
most
closely
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations.
we
think
that
no
federal
statute
of
limitations
expressly
governs
false
claims
act
retaliation
actions
and
therefore
hold
that
the
most
closely
analogous
state
statute
of
limitations
supplies
the
time
limit.
the
only
possible
federal
statute
of
limitations
applicable
to
retaliation
claims
is
set
forth
in
section
3731(b)(1)
of
the
false
claims
act.
it
provides
that
the
time
limit
for
filing
a
cause
of
action
begins
to
run
on
the
date
the
defendant
submits
the
false
claim
for
payment.
for
reasons
we
explain
in
detail
in
the
opinion,
we
find
that
this
statute's
text
is
ambiguous
about
whether
it
governs
the
retaliations
actions.
we
resolve
this
ambiguity
primarily
using
a
rule
of
statutory
construction,
the
presumption
that
statues
of
limitation
begin
to
run
when
the
cause
of
action
arises.
if
section
3731(b)(1)
governs
retaliations
actions,
then
the
limitations
period
will
begin
to
run
before
the
cause
of
action
arises
contrary
to
our
presumption.
by
contrast,
if
we
borrow
the
most
closely
analogous
state
limitations
period,
the
time
limit
will
begin
when
the
cause
of
action
accrues
in
keeping
with
our
presumption.
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
most
closely
analogous
state
limitations
period
governs
false
claims
act
retaliations
claims.
