justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
something
that
i
hadn't
concentrated
on
before
now,
but
your
position
that,
well,
if
you're
transferred
to
the
court...
to
the
court
of
claims,
that
you
bring
with
you
all
of
the
previous
rulings
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
california
and
that
those
are
somehow
binding
because
of
the
law
of
the
case...
what
is
the
authority
for
that?
the...
the
court
that's
transferred
has
to
accept
all
the
rulings
that
have
been
made
previous
to
the
transfer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
what's
the
authority
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the...
the
whole
point
of
the
district...
correct
if
i'm
wrong.
this
is
your
area.
the
whole
point
of
the
district
was
to
make
it
easier
for
the
united
states
to
know
with
whom
it
was
dealing
to
have
an
efficient
system,
and
if
you
say,
well,
that
doesn't
include
lawsuits
for
damages,
it
seems
to
me
that
destroys
much
of
the
purpose
of
the
formation
of
the
district.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i...
may
i...
has
that
always
been
your
view
throughout?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
throughout
the
litigation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
money
damages...
waiver
always
used
the
word
money
damages.
when
it
says
adjudicate
the
rights
under
the
contract,
that
doesn't
include
money
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
district
get
damages
from
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
provision
in
the
judgment
at
page
110
that
was...
that
was
cited
to
us,
that...
that
the
parties
may
obtain
other
appropriate
relief
by
the
filing
of
a
new
action?
