mr.
stuart
l.
somach
yes,
your
honor.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
westlands
water
district
has
argued
in
its
brief
that
petitioners
are
not
intended
third
party
beneficiaries
with
enforceable
rights
under
the
1963
contract.
i
want
to
make
two
points
from
the
perspective
of
the
district
why
this
must
be
so.
first,
allowing
a
direct
right
of
action
by
petitioners
is
not
practical
or
consistent
with
the
district's
need
and
ability
to
function
as
a
governmental
entity
and
to
allocate
all
of
the
water
that
it
receives
under
contract
to
all
of
the
landowners
within
the...
the
district.
this
is
a
scarce
and
valuable
resource,
and
these
types
of
third
party
lawsuits
jeopardize
the
district's
ability
to
be
able
to
provide
water
pursuant
to
california
water
code
provisions
to
all
of
the
landowners
within
the
district.
second,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
california
and
reclamation
law,
working
in
harmony
one
with
the
other--
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
--no.
i...
i
think
quite
on
the
contrary.
you
know,
and
unfortunately,
the...
the
history
of
this
contract
and
these...
these
issues
has
been
anything
other
than
the
district
avoiding
litigation.
the...
the
whole
concept
of
a
water
district
is
not
to
individualize
or
incrementalize
the
water
and
interests
in
water
in
any
one
group
of
landowners
or
any
one
landowner.
the
idea
is
that
the
rights
of
all
of
the
landowners
to
all
of
the
water
under
the
contract
are
to
be
treated
as
a
whole
and
allow
the
district
to
provide
protection
to
all
of
the
landowners
within
the
district
as
a
whole,
the
point
there
being
that
the
water
doesn't
belong
to
any
one
landowner
or
a
group
of
landowners.
it
belongs
to
the
whole.
and
in
fact,
the
way
the
district
operates,
the
way
it
has
to
operate
is
in
the
context
of
the
whole.
bonds
are
issued.
encumbrances
on
lands
are...
are
incurred,
all
based
upon
not
individual
rights
to
water
but
rather
broad
rights
of
water
throughout
the
district.
to
allow
a
small
group
of
landowners
to
decide
how
to
administer
the
contract,
how
to
enforce
the
contract
in
any
one
given
situation
leaves
decisions
that
are
critical
to
all
of
the
landowners
solely
in
the
hands
of
an
unaccountable
small
group
of...
of
landowners.
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
oh,
absolutely
not.
yes,
it...
yes,
it
can.
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
no.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
yes,
you
are
right.
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
and
absolutely
not.
it
can't
do
just
anything
it
wants
to
do.
it
is
subject,
as
a
governmental
entity,
to
all
the
strict
requirements
of
california
water
law
and
governmental
law,
for
that
matter.
if,
for
example,
these
petitioners
decide
for
whatever
reason
they
don't
like
a
decision
of
the...
of
the
board...
and
in
fact,
that
is
an
example
that
exists
emanating
out
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
when
the
district
decided
that
it
was
better
to
settle
the
litigation,
these
landowners
first
petitioned
the...
the
governing
body
of
the...
of
the
district
and
sought
to...
to
have
them
not
proceed
in
that
manner,
the
way
any
other
group
of
citizens
or
constituents
with
any
other
governmental
entity
would
have
proceeded.
the
district
decided,
however,
that
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
all
of
the
landowners
within
the
district
to
settle
the
litigation.
now,
at
that
point
in
time
certainly,
these
petitioners
had
the
normal
and
ordinary
rights
that
any...
any
constituent
within
the
district
has
to
be
able
to
challenge
a
decision
that
has
been
made
by
the
district.
that
includes,
for
example,
writ
proceedings,
to
argue
that
the
decision
of
the
board
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
otherwise
unlawful,
and
that
it
should...
should
be
mandated
to...
to
proceed
in
some
other
fashion.
if
the
issue
were
damages,
this
district
is
subject,
like
any
other
governmental
entity
within
the
state
of
california,
to
the
government
tort
claims
act
if...
if
they're
tortious
type
damages.
and
if
we
have
arguable
impairment
of
property
rights,
this
district
is
subject
to
the
california
constitution,
the
united
states
constitution,
and
the
government
code
provisions
that
provide
for
litigation
with
respect
to
those
broader
types
of...
of
damages.
and
quite
frankly,
this
is
a
governmental
body
and
it
is
very
susceptible
to
the
political
process.
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
for...
for
the
district
to
be
standing
up
here
and
telling
you
that
its
landowners
aren't
entitled
to
receive
what
they
want.
that's
a
very
difficult
for
the
district
to...
to
do.
but
in
dealing
with
the
rights
of
the
entire
district,
it's
an
absolute
essential
thing
to
do.
if
these
landowners
had
exercised
their
prerogatives
under
california
law,
they
could
have,
assuming
they
were
the
majority,
controlled
the
decisions
of
the
board
of
directors
in
the
way
that
any
majority
constituency
controls
the
director...
the...
the
direction
and
the
decisions
of
a...
of
a
governing
board.
you
know,
this...
this
lawsuit
is
instructive
in...
in
a
number
of
ways
in
terms
of
these
practical
concerns
that
we
have
in
terms
of
how
in
the
world
are
we
going
to
be
able
to
administer
a
contract
like
this
one.
how
are
we
going
to
do
all
of
the
things
that
the
water
code
has
told
us
that
we
have
to
do
if,
at
any
given
time,
a
landowner,
a
small
group
of
landowners
is
able
to
go
into
federal
district
court
and
independently
decide
that
it
wants
to
administer
the
contract
that
the
district
has
with
the
united
states
or
to
enforce
terms
of
the
contract
that
it
has
with
the
united
states
in
a
manner
that's
inconsistent
or
different
than
the
way--
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
--well,
it...
it
really
requires
the
district
to,
in
a
sense,
race
to
the
courthouse
with
the...
with
the
petitioners
in
order
to
be
there
first
in
order
to
have
its
views
of
the
contract--
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
--yes.
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
no.
i
think
it
is
a
different
situation,
and
i
agree
with
what
you...
what
you
have
said,
your
honor.
i
do,
however,
want
to...
to
not
avoid
the
concern
that
may
be
expressed
here,
and...
and
that
is,
that...
that
what
it
does
is
it...
it
forces
the
district
into
a
situation
of
chasing
its
landowners,
in
essence,
around
from
one
litigation
forum
to
another
in
order
to
ensure
that
its
means
of
controlling
and...
and
administering
the
contract
is
not
jeopardized.
the
fact
that
the
landowners...
if
the
landowners
can
move
forward
independently
with
litigation
with
respect
to
the
contract,
what
it
really
does
is
create
in
a
sense
a...
the
contract
becomes
this
very
interesting
moving
target
where
the
district
has
its
views
about
what
the
contract
is
and
how
it
should
be
administered,
how
it
should
be
enforced,
and
then
it
proceeds
in
one
direction
as,
for
example,
it
did
with
the
settlement
in
this
litigation,
deciding
that
that
was
the
best
way
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
district.
had
these
petitioners
on
the
merits
in
a
hypothetical
situation
prevailed
with
a
totally
different
result,
that
would
have
substantially
affected
and
impacted
the
district's
ability
to
be
able
to
maintain
the
obligations
and
the
commitments
that
it
made
to
the
other
settling
parties.
that
destabilizes
the
ability
of
the
district
to
actually
act
in
other
governmental
forums,
in
forums
with
the
united
states,
with
the
state
of
california,
with
other
districts
in
the
context
of
attempting
to
say
we
control
the
contract,
we
enforce
its
terms,
and
we
can
make
commitments.
and
when
we
make
those
commitments,
we
can
abide
by
and
we
can
live
up
to
those
commitments
in
a
way
that...
that
governments
ought
to
be
able
to
do
when
they're...
when
they're
making
those
types
of
commitments.
having
the
landowners
being
able
to
come
or...
and
here,
i
want
to
make
certain.
when
i
use
the
word
landowners,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
landowners
are
not
beneficiaries
of
the
contract.
they
certainly
are.
mr.
stuart
l.
somach
yes.
i...
i
think
that
that...
that
phrase
is
actually
begun
as
a
proviso,
and
i
view
it
as
not
limiting
the
ability
of
the
area
i
landowners
in
the
barcellos
&
wolfsen
judgment
that
you're...
that
you're
quoting
from
from
being
able
to
act
in
any
other
way.
it
was
a
nonlimiting
provision.
the...
the
first
part
of
the...
the
part
that
you
read
deals
with
what
their
rights
to
enforce
were.
the
second
part
was
a
proviso
that
simply
said
notwithstanding
this,
whatever
else
you're
able
to
do,
you
may
do.
thank
you
for
your
time.
