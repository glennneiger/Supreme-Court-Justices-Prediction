what
do
you
make...
excuse
me.
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
for
reasonable
construction
of
the
contract
that
in
fact
you
just
simply
cannot
have
a
system
that
would
promise
the
chaos
that...
that
you
are
promising?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
it
correct,
as
justice
scalia
suggested
earlier,
that
so
far
as
state
litigation
is
concerned,
it
would
be
limited
simply
to
arbitrary,
unreasonable
behavior?
