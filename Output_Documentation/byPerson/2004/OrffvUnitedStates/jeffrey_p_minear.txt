mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
cannot
maintain
this
suit
for
breach
of
the
westlands
contract
because
the
westlands
contract
is
itself
subject
to
the
rules
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
section
390uu
authorizes
only
a
limited
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
does
not
authorize
suits
by
incidental
beneficiaries
for
money
damages.
for
many
of
the
points
that
have
already
been
raised
by
justice
breyer,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--in
one
circumstance,
your
honor.
this
suit
allows
a
district
that
has
been
sued
by
individual
water
users
to
join
the
united
states
in
the
ongoing
suit
and,
in
fact,
remove
the
case
to
federal
court
if
necessary,
so
there
can
be
a
determination
of
all
the
rights
in
those--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
it
did
not,
but
that
did
occur
in
the
barcellos
&
wolfsen
litigation
that
ran
between
1978
and
1980.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
suit
was
brought
under
the
apa,
and
the
district
brought
the
suit
on
that
basis.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
suit
was
properly
brought.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
it
was
not
brought
under
390uu.
instead,
there
was
an
allegation
that
the
united
states
had
acted
unlawfully
and
the
westlands
relied
on
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
no
money
damages
as
well,
and
that's
what
distinguishes
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
that
is
our
view,
and
let
me
supplement
your
comments
in
this
regard.
section--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
has
been
our
view
under
390uu
when
section
390uu
has
been...
has
been
raised.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
throughout
this
litigation?
i
can't...
i
can't
be
sure
that
we've
maintained
a
consistent
position,
but
ultimately
this
is
a
question
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
the
importance
is
that
we
get
the
issue
right
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
let
me
explain
why
that's
the
case,
and
there
was
an
answer--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--why
there's
a
necessity
for
an
ongoing
suit.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
this...
this
provision
was
enacted
in
response
to
a
specific
problem
that's
illustrated
by
the
barcellos
&
wolfsen
litigation.
individual
farmers
sued
an
irrigation
district.
the
irrigation
district
was
concerned
that
it
might
be
subject
to
inconsistent
liability
to
the
farmers
on
the
one
hand
and
the
federal
government
on
the
other,
and
it
sought
to
join
the
united
states.
there
was
no
mechanism
in
1978
for
that
type
of
suit.
congress
acted--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--the
language
could
be
construed
to
allow
that,
but...
but
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
are
construed
narrowly,
and
the
language
i
think
is
more
properly
construed,
as
justice
breyer
has
suggested,
to
allow
joinder
as
a
necessary
party.
and
in
fact,
it
was
enacted
in
specific
reaction
to
that
problem
in
the
barcellos
&
wolfsen
litigation
where
we
did
have
ongoing
litigation
and
there
was
a
sense
by
the
irrigation
district
they
needed
to
join
the
united
states
so
they
would
not
be
subject
to
inconsistent
suits.
so
although
i
think
that
the
language
can
bear
the...
the
interpretation
that
you're
suggesting,
justice
scalia,
nevertheless,
i
think
the
better
interpretation
is
the
more
narrow
one
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
we
read
that
as
allowing
removal
in
those
circumstances
when
the
united
states
is
joined
later.
in
any
event,
i
have
to
say
that
with
regard
to...
to
this
disagreement,
it
does...
it's
not
dispositive
or
even
affect
the
case
here.
the
fact
is
that
this
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
no
circumstances
would
allow
this
suit
to
go
forward.
apart
from
the
money
damages
aspect,
which
itself
is...
is...
would
preclude
this
type
of
suit,
these
parties
are
not
intended
beneficiaries,
and
without
being
intended
beneficiaries,
there's...
in
no
circumstances
could
they
ever
evoke
these
provisions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
that
under
your
cases,
such
as
pena
v.
lane,
there
needs
to
be
a
specific
reference
to
money
damages.
this
simply
is
referencing
declaratory
relief,
and
so
we
do
not
believe
it
would
allow
an
award
of
money
damages.
rather,
the
party
must
go
to
the
claims
court
if
they're
seeking
money
damages.
and
in
fact,
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
there
is
somewhat
broader.
it
does,
as
mentioned
before,
allow
implied
or
express
contracts.
so
this
suit
is
simply
in
the
wrong
court.
but
i
would
like
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
i
do
not
think
in
this
context
it
would.
i
think
there
needs
to
be
something
more
specific.
we're
really
talking
about
declaring
rights
here
and
not
providing
a
specific
remedy.
and
this
court
has
always
taken
the
view
that
the
claims
court
jurisdiction
is
the
appropriate
forum
for
deciding
money
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
i
think
that
simply
refers
back
to
the
previous
sentence,
which
refers
to
adjudicate,
confirm,
validate,
or
decree.
now,
if
you
interpret
that
to
include
money
damages,
then
the
second
sentence
would
follow,
but
i...
i
think
the
two
have
to
be
construed
together.
and
in
our
view
simply
allowing
a
party
to
adjudicate,
confirm,
validate,
or
decree
in
these
circumstances
would
not
allow
award
of
money
damages.
certainly
i
think
congress
would
be
much
clearer.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
your
honor,
again,
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
are
construed
narrowly.
now,
let's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
have
to
say
that
the
language...
you're
saying
that
the
language...
yes,
could
it
conceivably
be...
be
interpreted
in...
on...
that
broadly.
but
that's
not--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
might
well
be,
but
this
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
but
your
honor,
ultimately
i
think
that
we
have
to
focus
on
that
this
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and...
and
so
far
we
have
not
touched
on
the
question
of
whether
these
parties--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--your
honor,
i
think
i
started
with
that
point,
that
an
incidental
beneficiary
cannot
invoke
this...
this
provision.
and
i'd
like
to...
to
continue
with
that
point
because
the
party
here
is
merely
an
incidental
beneficiary
and
not
an
intended
beneficiary.
under
any
of
the...
the
tests
that
have
been
applied
for
third
party
beneficiaries,
the
party
here
would
not
qualify
as
an
intended
beneficiary.
most
importantly,
the
contracting
parties
here,
the
united
states
and
westlands,
expressed
no
intent
to
give
this
party
enforcement
rights.
what's
more,
the
contract
does
not
provide
that
performance
would
be
rendered
to...
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
the
contract
is
quite
clear
that
performance
is
rendered
to
westlands.
this
is
a
contract
in
which
the
united
states
furnishes
a
specified
amount
of
water
to
westlands
and
westlands
pays
money
for
it.
westlands
then
has
a
separate
obligation
with
regard
to
the
farmers.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
arises
from
the
regulations
that
the
westlands
water
district
has
enacted
that
provides
for
the
delivery
of
water
from
westlands
to
the
individual
farmers.
the
united
states'
obligation--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that's
right.
that
is...
and
westlands
has
the...
has
the
option
of
either
engaging
in
contracts
with
the
individual
farmers
or
distributing
the
water
through
regulation,
and
it
has
opted
for
regulations.
now,
westlands
itself
is
a
governmental
unit.
it
is
comprised
of
the...
of
the
very
farmers
here,
among
others,
who
have
brought
this
suit.
and
it
has
the
authority
to
act
in
a
representative
capacity
on
behalf
of
all
its
members.
and
that
is
why
the
united
states
enters
into
contracts
with
irrigation
districts
precisely
because
it
allows
them
to
reach
accord
and
agreement
and
to
resolve
their
disputes.
now,
the
fact
is
that
the
united
states
and
westlands
agree
on
a
great
many
things.
sometimes
they
disagree,
but
when
we
disagree,
we're
able
to...
to
speak
to
one
another
as
two
governments
representing
constituencies
and
hammer
out
our
differences.
and
that
would
be
impossible
if
these
types
of
third
party
beneficiary
suits
were
allowed.
and
i
think
that
goes
to
the
crux
of
what
the
united
states'
real
concern
here
is.
when
there
are
contracts
between
one
government
and
another,
just
as
in
the
context
of
treaties
or
compacts
among
the
states,
it's
vital
that
the
two
governmental
units
be
able
to
deal
with
one
another
as
governments
and
to
be
assured
that
if
they
can
reach
accord
on
behalf
of
their
representatives...
on
behalf
of
the
parties
they
represent,
that
that
will
resolve
the
issue.
if
it
were
otherwise,
this
type
of
distribution
of
water--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
let's
look
at
what
would
happen,
your
honor,
if
that
did
happen.
the
individual
farmers
would
sue
westlands,
claiming
that
westlands
was
not
living
up
to
its
contract
obligations.
westlands
would
invoke
390uu
and
join
the
united
states
in
that
suit.
and
the
question
of
the
legal
rights
would
be
determined
on
that
basis.
so
the
mechanism
that...
that
we've
specified
and
the
way
that
we
interpret
it
deals
precisely
with
the
problem
that
you've...
you've
addressed.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
and
again,
i
think
it's
instructive
to
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
when
those
laws
were
enacted,
the
united
states
reacted
to
those.
westlands
brought
a
suit
under
the
apa
challenging
the
interpretation
of
the
statutes.
westlands
was
entitled
to
do
that
under
the
apa.
the
united
states
and
westlands
reached
an
accord,
together
with
the
environmental
intervenors
in
this
group,
that
was
satisfactory
to
those
parties.
and
it
simply
would
be
very
disruptive
of
the
system
if
a
minority
of
farmers
in
the
westlands
district
could
then
bring
a
suit
and
upset
that
agreement
and
that
accord
that
had
been
reached.
finally,
i'd
like
to
make
a
brief--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--technically
yes,
but
their
damages
are
limited
by
the
terms
of
the
contract.
westlands
could
sue
the
united
states
in
claims
court
for
a
breach
of
the
contract,
but
the
contract
itself
says
that
any
damages
that
are...
that
the
sole
liability
of
the
united
states
in
these
circumstances
would
be
an
adjustment
of
the
account.
in
other
words,
there
are
not
consequential
damages.
rather,
if
we
do
not
provide
westlands
with
the
water
that
westlands
believes
it's
entitled
to,
then
we
stand
liable
for
an
adjustment
in
the
payments
that
westlands
would
make
to
us.
the
suit
that
is
being
brought
here
is
asking
for
consequential
damages,
and
we
believe
that
the
contract
here
does
not
allow
consequential
damages.
that,
of
course,
is
a
merits
question
that
there's
no
need
for
the
court
to
reach,
but
that
is
the
way
it
would
be
resolved
in
claims
court
in...
in
our
view.
i'd
like
to
also
raise
the
question
of
property
rights
since
that
has...
has
come
up,
that
one
of
the
arguments
that
has
been
made
by
westlands
is
that
they're
entitled
to
status
of
a
third
party
beneficiary
because
they
claim
they
have
water
rights
in
these
circumstances.
the
fact
is
that
the
united
states,
the
state
of
california,
and
westlands,
as
well
as
the
california
water
resources
board
and
the
first
tier
of
california
courts,
have
all
concluded
they
do
not
have
the...
the
water
rights
that
they
claim.
but
in
any
event,
our
view
is
that
that
issue
is
irrelevant
to
the
inquiry
here.
rather,
the
question
of
third
party
beneficiary
status
turns
on
the
intent
of
the
contracting
parties.
did
they
or
did
they
not
intend
to
give
enforceable
rights
to
the
third
party?
here
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
that
was
an
intent...
there
was
an
intent
to
create
enforceable
rights
in
that
third
party.
quite
to
the
contrary.
the
only
reference
of
third
parties,
the
farmers,
in
the
contract
here
is
directed
to
limitations
on
what
the
district
can
do
once
it
receives
its
water.
it
doesn't
create
rights
in
them...
the
individual
farmers.
what
it
does
it
restricts
the
ability
of
the
district
in
order
to
protect
the
united
states'
interests,
to
make
sure
the
united
states
will
be
paid
for
the
water
that
it
ultimately
provides
to
the
district.
the
central
point
that
i
would
like
to
leave
you
with,
though,
here
at
the
end
is
the
importance
of
protecting
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
westlands.
but
although
we
disagree
on
some
matters,
we
are
able
to
reach
accommodation
and
agreement,
and
when
we're
able
to
do
that,
it's
to
the
good
of
all
concerned.
the
contracts
and
the
laws
here
are
structured
to
allow
those
types
of
agreements
to
be
reached,
and
we
think
that
allowing
third
party
beneficiary
suits
would
be
very
disruptive
of
that...
that
operation.
