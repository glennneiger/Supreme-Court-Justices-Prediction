justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner,
california
farmers
and
farming
entities
purchased
water
from
the
respondent,
westlands
water
district
which
receives
its
water
from
the
united
states
bureau
of
reclamation
under
a
1963
contract
between
westlands
and
the
bureau.
in
1993,
westlands
and
other
water
districts
sued
the
bureau
for
reducing
their
water
supply.
petitioners,
though
not
parties
to
the
1963
contract
between
westlands
and
the
bureau
intervene
as
plaintiffs.
after
negotiations,
all
parties
except
petitioners
stipulated
to
dismissal
of
the
district’s
complaint.
petitioners
pressed
forward
with
the
claim
that
the
united
states
had
breached
the
contract
that
they
were
third
party
beneficiaries
entitled
to
enforce
the
contract,
and
that
the
united
states
had
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
from
their
breach
of
contract
suit
in
section
390uu
of
the
reclamation
reform
act
of
1982.
the
district
court
held
that
petitioners
were
neither
contracting
parties
nor
intended
third
party
beneficiaries
of
the
contract
and
therefore,
could
not
benefit
from
section
390uu’s
waiver.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
in
relevant
part.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
section
390uu
does
not
waive
the
united
states
sovereign
immunity
from
petitioner’s
suit.
the
provision
grants
consent
“to
join
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party
defendant
in
any
suit
to
adjudicate”
certain
right
under
a
federal
reclamation
contract.
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
must
be
strictly
construed
in
favor
of
the
sovereign.
in
light
of
this
principle,
section
390uu
is
best
interpreted
to
grant
consent
to
join
the
united
states
in
an
action
between
other
parties
when
the
action
requires
construction
of
a
reclamation
contract
and
joinder
of
the
united
states
is
necessary.
section
390uu
does
not
permit
a
plaintiff
to
sue
the
united
states
alone.
this
interpretation
draws
support
from
the
statues'
use
of
the
words
"necessary
party",
a
term
of
art
whose
meaning
calls
to
mind
federal
rule
of
civil
procedures
19(a)’s
requirement
for
joinder
of
parties.
the
interpretation
also
draws
force
from
the
contrast
between
section
390uu’s
language
which
speaks
in
terms
of
joinder
and
the
broader
phrasing
of
other
statutes
that
waive
immunity
from
suits
against
the
united
states
alone,
for
example,
the
tucker
act.
petitioner’s
suit
brought
solely
against
the
united
states
and
its
agents
is
not
an
attempt
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party
defendant
within
the
meaning
of
section
390uu.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
