mr.
william
m.
smiland
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
relevant
language
of
the
1963
contract,
as
illuminated
in
the
surrounding
circumstances,
was
confirmed
in
the
express
terms
of
the
1986
stipulated
judgment
which
commanded
the
district
and
the
united
states
to
perform
the
contract.
in
particular,
the
first
sentence
of
paragraph
4.2,
which
is
at
joint
appendix
page
111,
states...
and
i
quote...
the
district
acknowledges
that
it
entered
into
the
1963
contract
for
the
benefit
of
areas
1a
and
1b.
that's
the
premerger--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
long
history
of
litigation
here.
it
began
with
the
first
suit
in
1979.
we
were
in
the
district
court
there.
there
were
administrative
and
constitutional
and
equitable
issues
as
well,
and
we
were
able
in
that
initial
case
to
combine
all
those
forms
of
relief
in
the
district
court.
and
then,
of
course,
we
got
this
judgment
that
i
began
to
read
from.
and
from
then
on,
we
had
four
or
five
other
cases
all
in
the
district
court.
we
do
acknowledge
that
on
the
breach
of
contract,
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
well,
we
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
rule
19(s)?
mr.
william
m.
smiland
that...
that
procedure
was
not
invoked
here.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
no.
what
happened...
what
happened--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--because
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
statute
says
in
any
suit.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
well,
it...
it
does
and
that
case
was
litigated
against
the
united
states
by
my
clients
and...
and
we
won
in
the
peck
case.
and
we
think
that
should
have
ended
the
matter.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
any
suit
is
also
in
the
first
sentence,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
and...
and--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--the...
the...
in
the
sue
and
be
sued
cases,
this
court
construes
that
very
broadly,
and
this
is
the
same
root
word
and--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--i--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--they
were
not
the
signing--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--party.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
our...
our
argument...
and
again,
this
has
been
resolved
in
the
lower
courts
against
the
government.
but
our...
our
view
is
that
by
the
nature
of
the
intended
beneficiary
doctrine,
the
duty
is
owed
to
the
third
party,
as
well
as
to
the
promisee,
and
it's
enforceable
by
the
third
party,
as
well
as
the
promisee.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
once
the
determination
was
made
that
we
were
not
intended
third
party
beneficiaries,
that
was
the
law
of
the
case,
and
had
it
been
transferred
to
the
claims
court,
we...
we
would
have
been
bound
by
that
determination.
we
felt
we
had
to
bring
to
a
final
resolution
the...
the
intended
beneficiary
issue
before
we
could
proceed
in
the
claims
court
either.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
yes,
although
again
that...
that
court
had
been
hearing
these
matters
for
many
years
in...
in
numerous
cases
without
this
issue
ever
having
come
up.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
just
the...
the
language
of
in
any
suit
definitely
is--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--yes.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
only
the...
the
general
principle
that
language
should
be
read
in
its
ordinary
meaning--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--there...
there
at
least
is
no
evidence
that
congress
had
rule
19
in
mind
when
it
enacted
either
the
'52
statute
or
the
'82
statute
that
we...
we
stand
on.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
i...
our
understanding
is
if,
obviously--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--i
can't
cite
you
authority,
your
honor,
but
i...
we
were
very
concerned
about
that.
if
there
was
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
first
instance,
then
the
lower
court's
ruling
on
intended
third
party
beneficiary
i
would
think
should
be
vacated.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
it
is
and...
and
when
i
was
talking
about
in
any
suit--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--well,
it...
it...
if
the
words,
join
necessary,
limit
any
suit
and
the
language
that
justice
scalia
referred
to,
then...
then
maybe
we're
in
trouble.
but
otherwise--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--the
district
sued
the
united
states.
we
intervened.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
yes.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
the
record
is
very
sparse,
your
honor.
there
is
the
district's
motion
which
says
pretty
much
what
it
said
in
its
brief,
that
there
was
a...
a
thing
called
the
principles
between
it
and
the
united
states
and
various
parties.
and
as
a
result
of
those
principles,
which
are
not
in
the
record,
although
they
are
a
matter
of
public
record,
the...
the
district
in
its
discretion
elected
to
dismiss
the
case.
we
opposed
that.
we
would
have
hoped
the
district
would
have
kept
going.
we
lost
that
opposition.
the
district
was
dismissed,
and
we
were
allowed
to
proceed
on
our
own.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
there
are
two
statutes.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
they
pled
both,
your
honor.
although
at
that
time
the
water
still
was
available
for
delivery,
it
hadn't
flowed
to
the
ocean.
and
the
money
had
not
yet
been
collected
and
spent.
so
the
focus
initially
was
on
equitable
relief
to
stop--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--both
statutes
we
cite
say
that
judgments
can
be
entered
in
the
same
manner,
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances,
language
i
believe
from
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
again,
both
in
the
491
f.
supp.
decision
under
the
mccarran
act
and
in
the
peck
case,
the
district
court
held
that
money
damages
were
encompassed
by
that.
so
both
statute...
statutes
on
which
we
rely
have
language
in
it
taken
from
other
sources
of
law,
with
which
this
court
is
very
familiar
and
has
opined
on
several
times.
the...
the
only
unique
parts
of...
of
either
of
the
two
statutes
that
we
stand
on
are...
are
the
rights.
one
refers
to
administering
a
previously
adjudicated
right
to
the
use
of
water,
and
the
other
is
the
contract
language
we've
discussed.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
yes.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
no.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
for
example,
in
the
u.s.
v.
district
court
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1971,
under
the
mccarran
act,
that
fact
situation
was
not
before
you,
but
the
court
did
say
that
the
rights
to
which
the
statute
referred
were
all
inclusive.
it
read
it
broadly.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
well,
we
have
explicit
rights
here
and...
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if...
if...
and
this
was
certainly
the
legislative
history
behind
section
221,
not...
not
behind
mccarran.
but
if...
if
the
same
duty
is
owed
by
the
promisor
to
the
third
party
that
it
owes
to
the
promisee,
and
if
the
third
party
has
the
same
rights
of
enforcement
as
it
does
under
304
of
the
restatement
that
the
promisee
would
have,
why
should
it
be
any
different?
why
would
congress
have
intended
to
exclude
that?
and
it
used
the
word
contract.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
you
also
have
the
rule
that
the
word
contract
means
the
law
of
contract
and
not
parts
of
it.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
efficient
in...
in
collecting
land
assessments
and
water
charges,
but
there's
no
evidence
in
the...
either
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
submit,
or
the--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--nothing
was
said
about
litigation,
let
alone
intended
third
party
beneficiary--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--there's
a
lot
of
legislative
history
there,
and
it
talks
a
great
deal,
as
you
say,
your
honor,
about
efficiency
and...
and
the
convenience.
but
it's
not
talking
at
all
about
litigation,
about
remedies,
about
rights
once
there's
a
breach.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
well,
it...
this
is
a
transaction
between
a
water
seller
and
many
water
buyers.
yes,
in
1926
districts
were
put
in
the
middle,
but
it's
also
true
in
1939
in...
in
the
section
9(e),
congress
authorized
the
particular
type
of
contracts
we
have
here,
so
called
water
service
contracts,
and
it
doesn't
mention
district.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
the
bureau
had
the
discretion
administratively
to
deal
with
individuals.
so
throughout
the
history
of
the
reclamation
program,
you...
you
have
the...
the
core
transaction
is...
is
a
water
sale
from
the
government
to...
to
farmers.
and
that's
was
the
case
on
day
one
in
1902
and
it
still
is.
and
i'd
just
like
to
remind
the
court
that
paragraph
3
of
the
stipulated
judgment
at
page
110
of
the
joint
appendix
is
in
our
view
dispositive
here.
this
was
a...
an
agreement
by
the
united
states
and
the
district,
approved
by
a
court
after
formal
settlement
notice
was
dispatched
to
two
formal
classes,
and
it
says,
any
appropriate
relief
may
be
obtained
against
the
federal
parties
by
the
filing
of
a
new
action
for
violation
of
any
contract
arising
independently
of
this
judgment.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
again,
if...
if
this
court
should
hold
that
neither
of
the
two
statutes
on...
on
which
we
stand
waive
sovereign
immunity,
and--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--then...
then--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--the
decision
that
we're
not
intended
beneficiaries
should
be
vacated
and
we
should
have
a
chance
to
go
to
the
court...
claims
court.
i'd
like
to
reserve,
your
honor,
3
minutes,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
thank
you,
your
honor.
what
happened
here
is
that
the
united
states
sold
half
the
water
it
was
obligated
to
sell
under
the
contract.
it
doubled
the
price
it
was
permitted
to
charge
on
the
other
half.
it
was
a
massive
harm
to
the
farmers.
i'm
sure
you
understand.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
well,
that's
what
we
were
about
to
go
to
trial
on,
your
honor.
that's
a
merits
issue.
the
ninth
circuit
has
abstained
on
whether
there
was
a
mandatory
statutory
duty
to
cut
off
this
water,
and
i
urge
the
court
not
to...
to
dive
into
that
pool.
we're
trying
to
get
in
the
courthouse
doors.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
we
have
massive
cross
summary
judgment
motions
on
that
issue
and
we
were
entitled
to
go
to
trial
on
that...
on
our
claim
of
liability.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
i...
i
don't
make
much
of
it.
the
parties
here
and...
and
the
parties
in
the
west
fully
understood
for
20
years,
after
allen
orchards,
that
the
farmers
were
intended
third
party
beneficiaries.
that's...
we
settled
in
1986
with
that
understanding,
and
this
parade
of
horribles
just
has
not
come
to
pass.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
that's
true.
and
even
more
fundamentally,
the
united
states
breached
the
contract.
the
district
didn't
do
anything
wrong.
why
would
we
sue
the
district
when
the
united
states
cut
off
the
water
and
doubled
the
charge?
mr.
william
m.
smiland
we
had
a
little
mini
trial
on
that
in
front
of
the...
in
front
of
the
district
court,
and...
and
i
made
that
argument,
your
honor,
and
the
district
court
rejected
it.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
i
agree.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
well,
we...
we--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--we
had
a
stipulated
judgment.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
german
alliance,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
if
the
contract--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--if
the
contract
says--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--oh,
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
that's
true.
mr.
william
m.
smiland
articles--
mr.
william
m.
smiland
--15
and
29(b)
of
the
'63
contract
and
also
the
1965
contract
explicitly
refers
to
benefit,
and
probably
most
dramatically,
the
recordable
contracts
that
were
signed
actually
with
my
clients
and
the
united
states
said
that
they
were
made
in
consideration
of
the
direct
and
indirect
benefits
that
those
farmers
would
gain
from
the
1963
contract.
now,
paragraph
4.2
in
the
judgment,
which
came
some
years
later,
reconfirmed
that.
what
was
new
and
different
about
the
judgment
is
that
for
the
first
time
it
made
explicit...
we
think
it
was
implied
earlier,
but
explicit
that
there
was
enforceable
rights
in
the
farmers,
and
we've
argued
it
under
your
german
alliance
test
that's
not
required,
but
if
it
was
required,
we
bargained
for,
we
got
it.
the...
the
court
approved
that
and
the
congress
approved
that.
and
i...
i...
personally
i've
looked
at
all
of
these
cases
in
recent
months.
it's
very
rare
for
an
intended
beneficiary
to
have
language
like
that.
in
any
case,
as
i
was
saying,
my
clients
have
suffered
massive
losses.
they've
been
litigating
these
claims
for
25
years.
everyone
has
assumed
there
was
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
everyone
assumed
they're
intended
beneficiaries.
and
we
think
we
should
have
a
forum
and
a
remedy
and
a
right
to
our
day
in
court.
