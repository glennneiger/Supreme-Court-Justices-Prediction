mr.
smiland,
do
you
mind
telling
us
why
the
petitioners
never
filed
suit
in
the
court
of
federal
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we
don't
give
broad
construction
to
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
quite
the
reverse.
and
it
says
to
join
the
u.s.
as
a
necessary
party
defendant
in
a
suit
to
adjudicate,
confirm,
validate,
or
decree
the
contractual
rights
of
a
contracting
entity
in
the
united
states
regarding
any
contract
executed
pursuant.
now,
i
guess
the
farmers
were
not
technically
the
contracting
entity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you've
got
more
problems.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
take
the
position,
do
you,
that
westlands
could
have
agreed
with
the
united
states
that
it
wouldn't
enforce
its
new
laws
that
deprived
the
farmers
of
water?
you
don't
take
that
position.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
can't...
the...
presumably
the
federal
government
can't
negotiate
away
the
endangered
species
act
or
something.
the
fact
is
that
new
laws
were
passed
after
these
contracts
were
entered
into
with
westlands.
isn't
that
right?
