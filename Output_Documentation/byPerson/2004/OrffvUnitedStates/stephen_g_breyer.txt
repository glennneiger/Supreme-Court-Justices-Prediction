justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
concurrent?
i
mean,
the...
the
statute
i'm
reading,
the
one
you
brought
is
consent
is
given
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party
defendant.
is
that
what
happened
here?
they
were
joined
as
a
necessary
party
defendant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
were?
i...
i
think
that's...
isn't
that...
what
rule
of...
i
thought
there's
a...
a
rule
of
federal
procedure.
i
can't
remember
what...
what's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
is
that
what
they
were
joined
under?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
well,
all
right.
were
they...
there's
technical
phrase
well
known
in
the
law
to
be
joined
as
a
necessary
party
defendant.
given
the
normal
meaning
in
the
law
of
that
technical
phrase,
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
okay.
if
it
did
not
happen,
then
how
could
you
possibly
sue
in
that
court
rather
than
the
court
of
claims
where
the
statute
says
you
can
sue
on
any
implied,
as
well
as
express,
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
mean
in
any
suit
in
sentence
2
of
the
kind
referred
to
in
sentence
1?
does
it
mean
any
suit
in
the
universe?
any
suit
in
the
world?
any
tort
suit?
i
would
have
thought
that
sentence
2
refers
to
sentence
1.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
don't...
how
can
we,
if
we
have...
if...
if
i
read
this...
this
as
meaning
technically
what
it
says
and
it's
a
jurisdictional
matter,
how
could
i
do
anything
other
than
say,
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
you're
in
the
wrong
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
it
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
any
suit
you
can
join
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
it's
a...
see,
i
want
to
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
do.
as
i
read
the
language,
you're
out.
as
i
understand
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
makes
sense
to
me
if
you're
out,
and
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
if
you're
in.
and
maybe
there's
some
lower
court
precedent
to
the
contrary,
which
i'd
certainly
read,
but
is
there
any
supreme
court
precedent
to
the
contrary
that
supports
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
that
isn't
the
limiting
part.
the
limiting
part
is
in
any
suit
of
a
certain
kind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
give
consent
to
is
joinder
as
a
necessary
party.
and
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
ordinary
meaning,
you're
out
because
the
ordinary
meaning
of
joinder
as
a
necessary
party
is
you
weren't
joined
as
a
necessary--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
does
that
help
you?
because
it
says
any
suit
pursuant
to
this
section,
and
of
course,
this
section
starts
off
by
talking
about
addition
of
a
person
as
a
necessary
party.
so
how
does
the
last
sentence
help
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
you
agree
with
that.
i...
you're
caught
in
between
us
here,
and
i
understand.
[laughter]
and
i
guess
we
have
to
figure
out
what
is
the
right
meaning
of
that
initial
phrase.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that...
so
your
view...
i
mean,
what...
what
makes
sense
to
me
is
that
the
section
means
what
it
says,
that
consent
is
given
to
join
the
united
states.
that
means
join
them
in
an
ongoing
suit.
and
it
makes
sense
because
what
the
united
states
wants
is
anyone
who
sues
them
for
money
damages
goes
to
the
court
of
claims.
but
of
course,
where
you
have
an
ongoing
suit
between
two
other
people,
we'll
make
an
exception
because
there
it's
already
in
another
district
and
we'll
let
you
bring
the
united
states
in
as
a
necessary
party.
the
other
exception
is
when
you
don't
sue
for
money
damages.
that's
in
section
702
of
the
apa.
now,
that
to
me
makes
a
lot
of
sense
and
it's
consistent
with
the
language.
is
that
your
view
or
do
you
have
a
different
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
the
reason
that
you
would
sue
the
district
would
be
if
you
didn't
have
any
enforceable
promise
from
the
united
states
that
they
didn't...
wouldn't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
think
you
do.
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
therefore...
therefore,
i'm
looking
for
where
that
promise
is.
and
you
started
out
by
citing
a
page,
which
wasn't
a
page
of
the
contract.
it
was
a
page
of
some
kind
of
settlement,
and
that
page
said
that
the
district
agrees
that
they
entered
into
the
contract
with
helping
the
farmers
in
mind.
i'm
sure
they
did.
so
what.
i
mean,
i
might
buy
a
house
with
the
idea
of
helping
of
my
child.
i'm
going
to
give
it
to
him.
that
doesn't
mean
he
can
enforce
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
my
child
can
enforce
a
contract
i
enter
into
with
another...
i
buy
a
house
and
i
say
i
intend
to
give
it
to
my
daughter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
she
can
enforce
the
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
if
the
contract
says.
now,
that's
why
i
was
interested
that
you
didn't
cite
language
in
the
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you...
well,
i
mean,
you
started
out
by
referring
me
to
page
110
or
111--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
doesn't.
now,
what
is
the
language
in
the
contract--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
helps
you
the
most?
