justice
antonin
scalia
could
i...
i...
i
guess
i'm
not
following
this.
i
don't
know
why,
mr.
smiland,
you...
you
have
not
referred
to
the
last
sentence
of...
of
what
you
assert
was
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
says
any
suit
pursuant
to
this
section
may
be
brought
in
any
united
states
district
court
in
the
state
in
which
the
land
involved
is
situated.
why
isn't
that
what
you're
relying
on?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
i
take
that
to
mean
that
when
you
sue
one
defendant
and
you
also
sue
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party
defendant,
that
suit...
any...
that
would
be
a
suit
pursuant
to
this
section.
i...
i
don't
know
what
other
meaning
that...
that
sentence
could
have.
when
you
sue
two
parties,
one
of
whom
is
the
united
states,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it's
a
necessary
party
defendant,
that
suit
is
a
suit
pursuant
to
this
section
and
it
can
be
brought
in
any
united
states
district
court
in
the
state
in
which
the
land
involved
is
situated.
i...
i
don't
know
what...
what
other
suit
that...
that
sentence
could
refer
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
could
we
hear
your
argument
on...
on
the
sovereign
immunity
point
as
opposed
to
the
venue
point?
what...
on
what
ground
do
you
say
the
united
states
has
waived
its...
its
immunity
from
suit
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
turn
to
sovereign
immunity
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
let
me
make...
make
it
easy
for
you.
do
you
know
of
any
case,
other
than
cases
decided
by
this
friendly
district
judge,
in
which
a
suit
has
been
allowed
against
the
united
states
based
on
nothing
more
than
the
status
as
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
a
contract
to
which
the
united
states
has...
on
which
the
united
states
has
agreed
to
be
sued?
is...
is
there
any
such
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
you
think
it's
clear
that...
as
our
sovereign
immunity
law
requires,
that
such
a
third
party
beneficiary
can
sue
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
don't
understand
that.
the
rights
were
all
inclusive.
as...
as
i
understand
the
law
of
third
party
beneficiaries,
it...
it
used
to
be...
and...
and
perhaps
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted
still
was...
quite...
quite
restrictive.
it's
only
in
more
recent...
i
don't
agree
with
the
government's
argument
that...
that
you
have
to,
in
an
ordinary
contract,
explicitly
refer
to
the
third
party
beneficiary's
rights.
but
when
sovereign
immunity
is
at
issue,
it's...
it's
a
different
question,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
because...
because
we
have
a
rule
that
says
when
congress
wants
the
united
states
to
be
sued,
it...
it
must
say
so
clearly.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
haven't
really
achieved
very
much
efficiency
if
you
simply
get
the
united
states
out
of
the
business
of
collecting
the
payments
and
of
keeping
track
of
the
payments
but
leave
the
united
states
subject
to
suit
when
the
person
who
has
authority
to
do...
do
these
things
goofs.
i
mean,
what...
what
trouble
has
the
united
states
saved
itself?
it
would
still
have
to
ride
herd
over...
over
the
person
with...
with
whom
it's
dealing.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the...
the
justice
department
has
no
authority
to...
to
consent
to
suit
which...
which
congress
has
not
consented
to.
i
don't
see
how
this
strengthens
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
alone
wouldn't...
wouldn't
remedy
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
absence--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
no
money
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
to
be
an
ongoing
suit.
you
think
this
section
does...
does
not
permit
somebody
to
initiate
suit
against
one
party
and
at
the
same
time
against
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
what
is
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
that
is
to
say,
there's
a
suit
between
only
two
individuals
and
then
the
united
states
is
brought
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
that's
one
situation
that
this
provision
could
cover,
but
there
are
other
situations
that
this
provision
could...
could
cover.
let's
say
a
farmer
wants
to
bring
suit
against
the
district,
but
it
doesn't
really
know
whether
the
fault
is
with
the
district
or
whether
the
district
was...
was
compelled
to
do
what
it
did
by
the
united
states.
so
it
sues
the
district
and
just
in
case
the
united
states
was...
was
responsible,
it
joins
the
united
states.
why
doesn't
the
language
entirely
permit
that
kind
of
a
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
then...
then
how
do
you
explain
the
last...
the
last
sentence
of
that
provision,
which
is
any
suit
pursuant
to
this
section?
the
only
suit
that
the
section
refers
to
is
a
suit
in
which
the
united
states
is
joined
as
a
necessary
party
defendant.
that's
the
subject
of
the
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
the
last
sentence
says,
any
suit
pursuant
to
this
section
may
be
brought
in
any
united
states
district
court.
and
i
read
that
to
mean
if
you
want
to
sue
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party
initiating
a
suit,
you
can
bring
it
in...
in
any
district
court
in
which
the
land
involved
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
second
sentence?
the
united
states,
when
a
party,
shall
be
deemed
to
have
waived
any
right
to
plead
that
it
is
not
amenable
thereto
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty
and
shall
be
subject
to
judgments,
orders,
and
decrees
of
the
court
having
jurisdiction
and
may
obtain
review
thereof
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
same
extent?
it's
subject
to
the
judgments,
orders,
and
decrees
of
the
court
to
the
same
extent
as
a
private
individual
under
like
circumstances.
why
isn't
that
enough
to...
to
say
that
the
court
can...
can
award
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
separate
from...
where
does
that...
that
obligation
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
state...
a
state-created
obligation?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
could
you
expand
on
the
first
point
a
little
bit?
i
mean,
you
say
you
don't
want
to
be
bothered
with
lawsuits.
is...
is
that...
is
that
all
that
it
amounts
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't...
can't
such
a
suit
be
brought
in
state
court?
i
can't
believe
that
this
district
can
do
whatever
it
wants
with
the
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
suit
in
state
court,
i
assume,
would...
would
only
be...
the
claim
would
be
that
you
were
acting
arbitrarily,
and
so
long
as
your
interpretation
of
the
contract
was
a
reasonable
one,
the
suit
would
fail.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas,
this
suit
here...
it
doesn't
matter
how
reasonable
it
is.
if
it's
wrong,
it's
wrong.
i
mean,
it's
quite
a
different--
justice
antonin
scalia
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
i've
asked
a
lot
of
questions.
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it's
arbitrary
not
to...
not
to...
for
an
agency,
of
which
you're...
you're
in
some
sense
at
least
the
beneficiary,
not
to
insist
upon
its
contract
rights,
just
as
a
shareholder
can
insist
that
the...
that
a
corporation
enforce
its
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he
was
wrong.
that
was--
[laughter]
