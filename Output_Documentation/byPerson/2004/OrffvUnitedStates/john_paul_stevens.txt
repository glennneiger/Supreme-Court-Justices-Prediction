justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
orff
against
the
united
states.
mr.
smiland.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smiland,
can
i
ask
this
question?
if
justice
breyer
is...
the
thrust
of
his
question
is
right,
i...
i
think
the
district
itself
could
not
have
brought
the
suit
under
his
reading
of
the
sovereign
immunity.
and
i
just
wonder,
has
the
united
states
ever
taken
the
position
that
the
district
could
not
have
initiated
this
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
yes,
isn't
it
arguable,
though,
that
in
this
case
the
government
probably
thought
that
it
would
be
efficient
to
have
the
district
represent
all
the
farmers
for
whatever
their...
to
the
extent
their
interests
were
shared
with
one
another,
rather
than
having
every
individual
have
the
same
right
to
bring...
bring
a
lawsuit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
for
the
fact
that
the
district
is
the
party
to
the
contract,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may,
indeed,
mr.
smiland.
mr.
minear,
i
think
you're
up
next.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear,
do
you
think
it
does
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
suits
brought
by
the
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
this
suit
begin
as
a
suit
by
a
water
user
against
the
district
and
then
you
were
joined
later?
is
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
in
this
suit,
did
not
the
district
bring
it
against
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
that
a...
was
that
jurisdiction
proper
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
it
properly
brought
is
what
i'm
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
contractual
rights
include
a
right
to
be
paid
for
something,
why
wouldn't
you
get
a
money
judgment
in
a
case
like
that?
that
first
sentence
certainly
covers
the
possibility
of
a
contractual
right
to
be
paid
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
pretty
clear
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
certainly
if
it
were
not
a...
a
united
states
and
were
a
private
individual,
it
would
include
money
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
the
next
sentence,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
says
the
united
states
shall
be
treated
just
like
a
private
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
you've
got
a
very
strong
argument
when
you
talk
about
an
incidental
third
party
beneficiary
not
being
a
contracting
party,
but
now
you're
asking
for
a
much
broader
holding
than
really
necessary
to
dispose
of
this
case,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
somach,
will
you
tell
us
what
the
district's
views
on
this
whole
matter
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
really
understand
why
that's
any
greater
burden
than
the
fact
they
can
sue
you
in
state
court
anyway.
they...
they
can
always
bring
litigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
somach.
mr.
smiland,
you
have
9
minutes
remaining,
but
you
do
not
have
to
use
it
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
smiland.
the
case
is
taken
under
advisement.
