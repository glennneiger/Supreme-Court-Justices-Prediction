justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you...
if
the
lower
courts
were
of
this
view,
why
did
the
district
court
in
this
case
give
you
three
opportunities
to
have
your
contract
claim
transferred
to
the
claims
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
does
suggest
that
the
district
court
had
at
least
some
concern
whether
the
case...
your
claim
had
been
lodged
in
the
right
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
you
can
explain.
this
was
not
your
suit
originally.
you
intervened.
right?
this
was
started
out
by
the
water
district.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
after
some,
i
think,
2
years--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
water
district
bows
out.
it
has
settled
its
case.
it's
a
mystery
what
it
settled
for.
at
least,
i
didn't
see
it
in
any
of
the
briefs.
why
did
the
water
district,
having
brought
this
case,
then
say,
we're
satisfied,
we're
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may...
may
we
just
back
up
to
the
question...
your
answer
to
justice
stevens?
i
thought
that
this
wasn't
a
suit
initially
on
the
part
of
the
water
district
for
money
damages.
i
thought
they
were
seeking
declaratory
relief
against
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
one
could...
one
could
read
the
words,
suit
to
adjudicate,
confirm,
validate,
or
decree
the
contractual
rights,
as
a
suit
for
declaratory
relief
but
not
encompassing
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
minear,
when
you
say...
when
you
say
not
money
damages,
do
you
read
the
words
that
i
read
to
mr.
smiland
restrictively
or
do
you
think
they
accommodate
money
damages,
that
is,
suit
to
adjudicate,
confirm,
validate,
or
decree
the
contractual
rights
of
a
contracting
entity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
say
under
the
contract.
i
thought
there
was
a
provision
in
the
contract
that
said
that
the
united
states
will
not
be
responsible
for
under
deliveries,
and
i
think
it
listed
the
drought
and
the
last
thing
was
any
other
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
were
saying
there's...
there's
a
right
under
this
contract
to
recover
from
the
united
states
for
an
under
delivery.
