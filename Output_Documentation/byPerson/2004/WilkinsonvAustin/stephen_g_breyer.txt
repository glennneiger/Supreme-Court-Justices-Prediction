justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about...
i
mean,
the
person,
if
he
reads
the
regulation,
would
see
that
it
says
that
to
classify
him,
the
state
has
to
show
that
through
repetitive
and
seriously
disruptive
behavior,
he
has
demonstrated
a
chronic
inability
to
adjust
as
evidenced
by
repeated
class
2
rule
violations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
guess
he
would
like
to
know
give
me
at
least
a
vague
idea
of
what
behavior
you're
talking
about
and
which
class
2
rule
violations
you're
talking
about.
now,
does
the
notice
tell
him
those
two
things?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
this...
i
mean,
that's
what
i
don't
understand
what
this
case
is
about
because
i...
i'm
amazed
that...
i
think
it
is
too
detailed
what
they're
requiring
of
you,
by
far.
but
the
elements
are
i
have
to
know.
i'm
an
inmate.
i
want
to
know
what
is
this
about.
suppose
i
think
they're
wrong.
i
need
to
know
how
to
tell
them
they're
wrong.
and
the
other
thing
i
think
i'd
need
to
know
is
after
the
committee
or
the
warden
decides
against
me,
what
are
his
reasons.
i'm
not
asking
for
a
book.
all
i
want
to
know
are
the
basic
reasons.
now,
those
things
i
can't
work
out
from
the
briefs,
quite
honestly,
whether
the
new
policy
gives
him
those
new
things,
those
two
things,
or
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
already
you
say
that,
but
i
would
think
the
basic
information
includes
some
idea
of
what
my
disruptive
behavior
was
and
some
idea
of
what
the
class
2
violations
that
i
was
convicted
of
was.
and
now,
i've
heard
you
both
say
that
he
does
get
it
and
that
he
doesn't
get
it.
i'm
sure
that's
my
fault,
but
i
want
to
know,
does
he
get
this
information
before
the
hearing,
or
does
he
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
you
heard
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
he
get
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
don't
care
that
he
doesn't
have
the
evidence.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
that
he
thinks
he's
being
sent
to
this
prison
because
his
roommate,
rat
fink,
has
made
up
a
bunch
of
stories
about
him.
all
right?
so
he
needs
to
know
whether...
what
it
is
that...
that
this
board
is
considering
before
he
can
come
in
and
explain
why
it
isn't
true.
he
doesn't
have
to
have
all
the
evidence.
he
has
to
know
what
the
point
is,
what
the
charge
is,
what
the
claim
is.
and
you're
saying
he
gets
it
because
he
has
the
report.
is
there
an
example
in
the
record
of
a
report?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
can
you
just
explain
that?
because
the
policy
says
that
he
shall
get
notice
and
attached
to
the
notice
will
be
a
committee
report.
then
they
have
a
copy
of
the
form
that
the
report
is
supposed
to
fill
out
on
page
58
to
about
page
78
and
it's
about
the
most
detailed
thing
i've
ever
seen.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
though...
you
mean
even
though
it
says
that
the
policy
says
you
should
be
noticed
and
you're...
it
says,
attached
to
the
notice
will
be
a
copy
of
the...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
looking...
am
i
looking
at
the
wrong
place?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here
is
the
exact
words
i...
i
think.
it's...
tell
me.
this
certainly
seems
to
be
right.
the
inmate
shall
be
served
with
notice
at
least
48
hours
prior
to
the
commencement
of
a
hearing.
the
notice
shall
include
all
of
the
reasons
for
the
proposed
placement--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
a
summary
of
the
evidence
relied
on.
now,
i'm
just
reading
that.
what
is
it
i'm
reading?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
where
is...
where
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry.
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
think
i've
got
your
point.
tell
me
if
i...
i
mean,
i've
now
looked
at...
this
is
very
confusing
to
me.
i'm
sure
it's
my
fault.
but
i
take
it,
if
you
look
at
page
22,
that's
the
new
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
the
new
policy
says
is,
committee,
you
must
give
the
prisoner
some
information.
then
it
refers
to
form
2598.
form
2598
is
the
form
on
page
58.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
that
tells
him
is
nothing
about
the
facts.
that
tells
him
he's
been
charged.
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
new
policy
goes
on
to
say,
the
classification
committee
shall
document
information
presented
by
staff
and
the
inmate
which
is
form
2627
and
2628.
and
i
don't
know
where
2698
fits
in,
but
2698
are
all
those
pages
with
the
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
just
doesn't
say
anything
about
them
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
point
is
in
the
past,
they
didn't
give
them
the
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
they
promulgated
a
new
policy
and
the
new
policy
says
nothing
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
it
says
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
why
can't
you
do
that
in
an
as-applied
challenge?
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
there
was
all
this...
suppose
we
wrote
an
opinion
hypothetically.
suppose...
and
it
said,
look,
i've
read
through
this
new
policy.
i
assume
it
will
be
administered
in
accordance
with
the
elements
of
due
process,
the
basic
elements
being
some
kind
of
notice
basically
what...
what
the
factual
part
is,
some
kind
of
opportunity
to
present
proofs
in
evidence
that's
a
reasonable
one,
and
some
kind
of
decision
by
a
neutral
decision-maker.
certainly
the
language
of
the
new
policy
permits
such
an
interpretation.
it
doesn't...
and...
and
suppose
we
were
to
say,
well,
we
assume
it
will
have
the
basic
elements,
and
it's
so
complex,
so
detailed
that...
that
if
they
don't,
then
the
individual
who
suffers
could
bring
a
claim
and
say
it
was
administered
unfairly
in
my
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
see...
yes.
i'm...
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you.
i'm
saying
i
read
their
new
policy,
now
having
gotten
to
it
the
third
time
through
all
this
detail,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
do
give
a
notice,
and
justice
o'connor
just
pointed
out
where
there's
a
place
for
reasons.
and
as
i
read
what
happens
after
the
committee
decides,
it
says,
it
shall
make
a
decision...
a
recommendation
accordingly...
according
to
this
very
long,
detailed
form.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
doesn't
say
they
won't
tell
the
prisoner.
it
doesn't
say
whether
they'll
tell
the
prisoner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
can't
i
assume
they
will
tell
him
so
he'll
know
what's
going
on?
and
then
if
they
don't,
you'd
have
an
as-applied
challenge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
before
the
new
policy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
now
saying
is
i
can
understand
exactly
why
you
might
feel
the
way
you
do.
but
our
job
is
to
not
necessarily
take
that
feeling.
but
shouldn't
we
presume
that
the
state
will
administer
words
that
comport
with
the
basic
elements,
not
every
detail
as
you
want,
but
they
will
administer
this
new
policy
in
accord
with
those
basic
elements
of
fairness?
isn't
that
giving
a...
sort
of
like
a
deference
to
the
state,
which
maybe
we
should?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
just
give
me
1
minute
on
the
other
issue?
