justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
does
he...
can
you...
can
you
describe
it
for
us
what...
he
gets
48
hours
notice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
notice
that's
there's
going
to
be
a
hearing.
what
else
does
he
get?
does
he
get
a
summary
of
the
written
report?
does
he
get
a...
a
statement
of...
of
the
reasons?
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no.
before
the
hearing
starts,
he
gets
48
hours
notice,
but
is
he...
is
he
just
told
there's
going
to
be
a
hearing
in
48
hours
and
that's
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
he
does
get
the
report.
justice
anthony
m.

48
hours--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
those
two,
it
seems
to
me,
are
all
questions
of...
of
fact.
i
mean,
ultimately
your
position
may
be
correct,
but
i...
i
just
can't
place
a
lot
of
store
in
this
predictive
versus
nonpredictive
judgment,
and
it's
contrary
to
your
own
argument.
you
say,
well,
in
almost
all
the
cases,
it's
because
he's
been
convicted
of
a
crime
in
prison
and
so
forth.
well,
that...
that
undercuts,
it
seems
to
me,
the...
the
basic
argument
that
you're
trying
to
make
that
established
this
line
between
predictive
and
nonpredictive
judgment.
i...
i
suppose
you
would
say
even
in
cases
where
it
is
a
matter
of
past
effect,
these
procedures
are...
are
adequate.
or
would
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
you
can
take
us
through
this
chronologically.
you...
you
began
at
the
end.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the
facial
attack
objection
would...
would
not
be...
carry
much
weight
if
what
happened
was
this.
there
was
a
trial.
the
policies
were
found
deficient,
and
the
court
said,
you
devise
some
new
forms.
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
facial
attack
would...
objection
would...
would
not
be
relevant.
and...
and
your
point
would
be
right.
you
say,
you
know,
they...
they
haven't...
this
doesn't...
is
not
going
to
cure
the...
the
deficiency.
but
what
happened
here
was
that,
as
i
understand
it,
midway
in
the
litigation
there
was
a
new
policy,
and
it...
it
seems...
so
we
have
sort
of
a
moving
target
that
we're
working
with.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
comment
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
what
we
have
before
us
is
this,
a
trial
which
showed
that
the
pre-new
policy
procedures
were
deficient
and
the
trial
judge
and
you
and
a
court
of
appeals
interpreted
the
new
policies
as
remedies
for
past
wrongs
that
were
established?
and
the
question
is
the
adequacy
of
that
remedy.
that's
one
way
to
look
at
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
another
way
to
look
at
the
case
is
to
say
that
ohio
admitted
that
there
were
some
improprieties,
showed
its
new
policy,
and
the
case
turned
on
the
adequacy
of
the
new
policies.
now,
those
are
two
different
things.
which
is
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
as...
and
as
to
those
prisoners,
was
there
a
requirement
that
the...
that
the
court's
procedures
be
made
applicable
and
so
there
would
have
to
be
a
retroactive
hearing
as
to
those
prisoners?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
on...
on
the
liberty
interest
where
we
started
with
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
the
attorney
general,
is
there
a
liberty
interest
in
not
being
transferred
from
prison
1...
level
1
to
level
2--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--level
2,
that
sort
of
thing?
why
is
it
that
there's
a
liberty
interest
in
being
transferred...
i
guess
being
transferred
from
4
to
5?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
they
have
reading
materials?
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
wilkinson
versus
austin
involves
ohio
prisons.
high
security
prisons
that
are
designed
for
total
isolation
are
known
in
prison
terminology
as
supermax
prisons.
a
supermax
prison
is
designed
to
segregate
the
most
dangerous
prisoners
from
the
general
prison
population.
this
case
concerns
the
process
by
which
ohio
and
its
prison
officials
assign
prisoners
to
the
supermax
facility.
the
case
began
when
a
class
if
inmates,
some
of
whom
were
and
some
of
whom
had
been
in
the
ohio
supermax
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
against
ohio
and
its
prison
officials.
the
inmates
alleged
among
other
things
that
the
supermax
assignment
system
and
the
confinement
there
violated
due
process
principles
and
the
opinion
refers
to
the
old
policy
and
the
new
policy
that
ohio
had
for
assignments.
when
the
inmates
filed
suit,
the
policy
known
as
the
old
policy
was
in
effect,
and
under
that
policy
haphazard
and
erroneous
placements
to
supermax
had
occurred.
now,
some
inmates
were
denied
any
notice
they
were
being
assigned
to
supermax
or
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
matter.
now,
on
the
eve
of
trial,
ohio
promulgated
a
revised
policy
and
this
is
a
new
set
of
guidelines
that
is
called
in
the
opinion
by
the
litigates
the
new
policy.
the
new
policy
provided
more
guidance
regarding
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
placement
decisions
and
it
afforded
inmates
more
procedural
protections
against
erroneous
placement.
the
district
court
found
first
that
the
inmates
have
a
protected
liberty
interest
in
avoiding
assignment
to
supermax
and
it
held
their
due
process
rights
had
been
violated
under
the
old
policy
and
the
unwritten
versions
that
preceded,
and
it
also
held
that
ohio's
new
policy
while
it
provided
some
more
procedural
safeguards,
even
so
was
inadequate
to
meet
due
process
requirements.
after
trial,
the
district
court
also
ordered
a
number
of
substantive
and
procedural
modifications
to
the
new
policy.
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
sixth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
holding
that
the
inmates
have
a
liberty
interest
and
it
also
affirmed
the
procedural
modifications
the
court
had
made
to
the
new
policy.
it
did
reverse
the
district
court's
substantive
modifications;
substantive
modifications
imposed
by
the
district
courts
were
to
specify
a
minimum
amount
of
drugs
that
the
prison
must
have
before
he
can
be
defined
to
supermax.
but
this
was
reversed
this
part
involving
substantive
modifications
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
part
of
the
ruling
is
not
before
us.
we
did
grant
certiorari
to
consider
what
level
of
process
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
ohio
to
follow
in
making
supermax
assignments.
the
resolution
of
the
case
presents
two
questions
and
the
first
is
whether
the
inmates
have
a
protected
liberty
interest
in
avoiding
transfer
to
supermax.
our
earlier
opinion
in
a
case
called
sandin
versus
o'conner
provides
us
the
relevant
instruction.
in
sandin,
we
held
that
the
liberty
interest
exists
in
avoiding
restrictive
prison
conditions
only
where
the
nature
of
those
conditions
themselves
impose
an
atypical
and
significant
hardship
on
an
inmate
in
relation
to
the
ordinary
incidents
of
prison
life.
now,
we
think
that
the
conditions
at
ohio
supermax
do
impose
just
such
a
hardship.
the
confinement
conditions
are
more
restrictive
than
any
other
form
of
incarceration
in
ohio
including
those
prisoners
on
death
row
or
on
disciplinary
segregation.
inmates
must
remain
in
their
cells
which
are
7x14
feet
for
23
hours
a
day
and
during
the
one
hour
per
day
that
inmates
are
permitted
to
leave
the
cells,
they
have
access
only
to
a
small
indoor
recreation
space.
a
light
remains
on
in
the
inmate's
cell
for
24-hours
a
day
and
although
it
may
be
dimmed,
an
inmate
who
attempts
to
shield
the
light
even
to
sleep
is
subject
to
further
discipline.
inmates
have
hardly
any
human
contact
even
to
the
point
that
conversation
is
not
permitted
from
cell
to
cell
and
the
cells
are
constructed
too
so
that
sound
cannot
carry
from
on
cell
to
the
other.
opportunities
for
visitation
are
very
rare
and
conducted
through
glass
walls.
aside
from
these
severe
conditions,
placement
at
supermax
is
for
an
indefinite
period
limited
only
by
an
inmate's
sentence.
inmates
otherwise
eligible
for
parole
lose
that
eligibility
while
there.
although,
any
of
these
conditions
standing
alone
might
not
be
sufficient
to
create
a
liberty
interest
in
avoiding
assignment
to
supermax,
taken
together,
we
think
they
do.
the
second
part
of
the
analysis
is
whether
the
procedures
ohio
provides
satisfied
basic
due
process
principles
to
safeguard
this
liberty
interest.
evaluating
the
efficiency
of
particular
prison
procedure
requires
consideration
of
the
three
factors
we
set
forth
in
our
decision
in
mathews
versus
eldridge:
the
first
is
the
inmate's
interest,
the
second
is
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
and
the
third
is
the
state's
interest.
application
of
these
three
factors
demonstrates
ohio's
new
policy
does
provide
a
sufficient
level
of
due
process.
the
opinion
discusses
the
problem
of
gang
violence
in
prisons.
supermax
prisons
are
in
part
a
response
to
the
increase
in
prison
violence
by
prison
gangs
which
impose
an
increasing
threat
to
prison
security.
clandestine,
organized,
fuel
by
race
based
hostility
and
committed
to
fear
and
violence
as
a
means
of
disciplining
their
own
members
and
their
rival,
these
gangs
seek
nothing
less
than
to
control
prison
life
and
to
extend
their
power
outside
prison
walls.
murder
of
an
inmate,
a
guard,
or
one
of
the
family
members
on
the
outside
is
a
common
form
of
gang
discipline
and
control.
committing
murder
can
even
be
a
condition
of
the
gang
membership.
testifying
against
or
otherwise,
informing
on
gang
activities
can
invite
a
death
sentence
for
the
informant.
given
the
circumstances
prison
administrators
face,
we
think
that
informal
non-adversary
procedures
are
all
that
are
required
in
making
assignments
to
supermax.
ohio's
new
policy
provides
such
informal
non-adversary
procedures
and
no
further
procedural
modifications
were
in
order.
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
to
find
the
inmates
possess
a
liberty
interest
in
avoiding
assignment
at
supermax
but
it
was
incorrect
to
sustain
the
procedural
modifications
ordered
by
the
district
court.
so,
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinions
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
