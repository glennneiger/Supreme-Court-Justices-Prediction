mr.
james
m.
petro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
purpose
of
any
hearing
process
is
to
get
a
better
answer.
if
the
question
is
what
happened
in
the
past,
an
adversarial
fact-finding
can
help
provide
the
answers.
if,
however,
the
question
seeks
to
look
forward
and
predict
future
behavior,
then
a
slightly
more
limited
procedure
will
serve
to
expedite
and
arrive
at
the
best
possible
answer
to
this
predictive
question.
mr.
james
m.
petro
no...
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
petro
no.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes,
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
we
could.
mr.
james
m.
petro
we...
we
made
a
decision
in
petitioning
the
court
that
the
liberty
interest
issue
was
something
that
we
would
not
raise.
we
raised
it
on
appeal
through
the
district
court
and
through
the
circuit
court.
we
chose
not
to
raise
it
here
to
focus
on
the
due
process
issue.
mr.
james
m.
petro
the...
the
circuit
court
made
a
factual
determination
that
there
was
a
significant
and
atypical
deprivation.
we
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
determination,
but
because
it
was
a
factual
determination,
we
chose
to
confine
our
appeal
to
the
issue
of
law.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes.
mr.
james
m.
petro
that
is
correct.
but
when
people
are
moved
to
level
5,
your
honor,
typically
they're
being
moved
from
level
4,
at
least
more
than
90
percent
of
the
time,
and
level
4
has
a
similar
area
of
restriction.
in
reality,
i
would
argue...
and
i
would
concur
with
justice
scalia...
that
this
is
not
a
significant
or
atypical
deprivation--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--your
honor,
we
chose
not
to--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--petition
on
that.
mr.
james
m.
petro
your
honor,
i
would
be
most
pleased
to
argue
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest
in
this
instance
under
sandin.
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
where
there
is
a
mandatory
state-created
interest,
that
interest
would
have
to
involve
a
significant
and
atypical
deprivation.
in
this
instance,
we
do
not
believe
that
moving
an
inmate
to
level
5
classification
is
a
significant
or
atypical
deprivation.
mr.
james
m.
petro
your
honor,
that
has
not
occurred
in
reality.
there
have
been
several
inmates
that
have
moved
from
admission
to
level
5.
mr.
james
m.
petro
your
honor,
it's
just
typically
what
occurs,
and
so
there
are
some
circumstances
where
a
level
3
inmate
may
be
moved
to
5,
but
in
any
event,
that
inmate
would
have
been
moved
to
4.
the
classification
jump
is,
in
a
practical
standpoint--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--your
honor,
that's
not
the
normal
practice.
in
fact,
it
involves--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--your
honor,
it
involves
a
small
number
of
inmates,
and
those
inmates
have
been
determined
through
a
very
predictive
determination
that...
that
in
fact
they
do
pose
a
threat--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--your
honor,
the...
the
deprivation
is...
is
perhaps
marginally
greater,
but
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
marginal,
and
therefore--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
it
is...
it
is
more...
it
is
much
greater
than
4.
but
whether
it
represents
something
that
is
unexpected
by
the
inmate,
in
reality
the
inmate
has
an
expectation
of
having
his
liberty
essentially
extremely
limited
in
this
instance--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--and...
and,
your
honor,
we
initiated
a
process.
it
is
our
new
policy
111-07,
which
the
district
court
and
then
the
circuit
court
ultimately
ruled
on,
where
we
made--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--yes.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes.
mr.
james
m.
petro
your
honor,
we
would...
i
would
continue
to...
to
argue
that
it
is
not...
if
it
is
significant
and
atypical,
it
is
marginally
significant
and
atypical.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes,
it
was.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
petro
no.
and
in
this
case
the...
but...
but
level
5
as
a
classification
is
a
limited
confinement.
it
is
reserved
for
those
very
dangerous
inmates
not
dissimilar
to
sandin.
mr.
james
m.
petro
your
honor,
they
are
reviewed
from
a
classification
standpoint
on
an
annual
basis.
they
are
reviewed
from
a
privilege
standpoint...
and
there's
different
levels
within
5...
on
a
quarterly
basis
and
so--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
petro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
[laughter]
in
this
instance,
the
process
due,
as
provided
by
ohio,
was
outlined
in
new
policy
111-07.
that
policy
was
adopted
and
ultimately
then
reviewed
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
held
it
to
be
unconstitutional
and
added
a
number
of
other
procedures.
the
process
that
was
contained
in
new
policy
111-07
was
a
predictive
policy,
and
it
understood--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--your
honor,
it
gave
notice,
48
hours
in
advance,
under
the
new
policy--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--notice
of
the
fact
that
there
would
be
a
reclassification.
mr.
james
m.
petro
it
doesn't
spell
out...
in
new
policy
111-07,
it
doesn't
spell
out
all
the
evidence,
but
it
gives
a
basic--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--it
gives
a
basic
statement
that
you're
being
considered
for
reclassification.
mr.
james
m.
petro
it...
it
as
a
general
rule
does
not
have
to
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes.
mr.
james
m.
petro
the
notice
is
very
general
in
its
nature.
at
the
time
that
the
hearing
actually
commences,
there's
an
opportunity
to
sit
down
and
actually
discuss
with
the
inmate,
and
the
inmate
can
respond
in
writing
or
in
presence
at
the...
at
the
hearing--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--there
is...
what
initiates
the
reclassification
is
a
report
form
that
would
identify
to
the
inmate--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--the
inmate,
your
honor,
has
access
to
the
report
form
that
says
specifically
what's
initiated.
mr.
james
m.
petro
at
the
point
of
notice.
mr.
james
m.
petro
the
new
policy
gives
him
the
basic
information
that
we
are
asserting
that--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--your
honor,
he
gets
the
basic
reason
for
the
classification
and
that's--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes,
he
does.
mr.
james
m.
petro
he
gets
the
basic
information.
he
doesn't
get
a
list
of
any
evidence.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes.
mr.
james
m.
petro
at
the
close
of
the
hearing,
he...
there
is--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--there's
going
to
be
a
hearing
and
it's
for
reclassification,
and
here
is...
here
is
the...
the
actual
report
that
actually
identifies
what
has
triggered
this
activity
for
reclassification.
mr.
james
m.
petro
so
he
gets--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--but
it's
a
very
bare
bones
report
and
it
doesn't
identify
the
specific
evidence
involved
which--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--okay.
mr.
james
m.
petro
there's
an
example
of
the
report
form
that
is
filled
out
by
the
prison
officials
at
the
time
that
a
reclassification
is
going
to
occur,
and
the
inmate
does
have
access
to
that
report
form
at
the
time
of
notice.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes,
your
honor,
he
does
get
that
notice.
he
gets
that
basic
form
that
basically
says
he's
being
reclassified.
mr.
james
m.
petro
he
gets
the...
the
accusation.
he
knows
the
accusation
is
made
from
the
report
form
that
is
prepared
by
the
prison
officials.
so
he
knows--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--that
one
of
those
criteria
has
been
asserted--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
petro
the
procedure.
yes,
it
is.
new
policy
111-07
is
what
the
district
court
reviewed
and
then
what
was
further
reviewed
by
the
circuit
court.
mr.
james
m.
petro
the
evidence
that's
in
the
record
was
the
procedure
in
place
prior
to
the
enactment
of
new
policy
111-07,
and
the
court
choose...
chose
to
review
for
procedural
purposes
policy
111-07
and
then
make
its
decision
based
on
new
policy
111-07.
so
the
evidence
that's
in
the
record,
the
testimony
at
the...
during
the
trial,
really
is
not
relevant
to
this
policy.
it's
relevant
to
the
former
policy.
if...
if--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--yes,
he
does
generally.
it
doesn't
give
any
evidence.
it
simply
is--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--okay.
mr.
james
m.
petro
i
understand.
mr.
james
m.
petro
he
will
get
the...
there
is
a
form
that
is
completed,
a
long
form
that
is
completed
by
the
prison
officials
that
basically
stipulates
the
predicate
act
or
the
predicate
acts
that
really
result
in
the
reclassification
action.
mr.
james
m.
petro
yes,
because
that
is
part
of
the
form.
with
the
court's
permission--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--yes,
it
is.
with
the--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
m.
petro
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
has
been
pointed
out
that...
that
inmates
stay
in
the
prison
for
many
years,
but
in
reality,
over
600
inmates
since
the
opening
of...
of
ohio
state
penitentiary
in
1998...
over
600
inmates
have
gone
into
level
5
and
over
550
inmates
have
left
level
5.
and
so
the
classification
process
is
an
ongoing
process.
it
is
now
established
under
an
order
of
the
district
court,
but
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
new
policy
that
was
presented
in
2002
at
the
time
this
case
was
pending
trial,
was
a
policy
that
provided
a
process
which
was
the
best
type
of
process
for
a
predictive
decision.
this
court
has
often
deferred
to
the
decision-making
of...
of
prison
officials
in
seeking
to
protect
the
safety
and
security
of
the
prison.
and
in
this
instance,
the
policy
that
was
put
in
place
and
the
hearing
process,
without
actually
having
essentially
a
fact-finding
process,
which
is
what
the
court
has
imposed
on
this
process,
was
the
kind
of
process
that
allows
for
prison
officials
to
review
a
whole
variety
of
additional
information
even
beyond
what
might
be
evidentiary.
when
we
think
about
the
conditions
in
the
prison
where
the
inmate
is
currently
housed,
if
they're
at
the
lucasville
penitentiary
in
level
4...
and
the
conditions
there
are
particularly
volatile...
the
prison
officials
need
to
have
the
flexibility
to
make
a
decision
on
placement
in
level
5
not
only
to
protect
this
inmate
but
to
protect
the
institution
itself
and
the
safety
of
the
inmates
and
the
safety,
of
course,
of...
of
the
personnel
that
work
at
the
facility.
in
the
mathews
test,
which
was
applied
both
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
is
clearly
an
acknowledgement
that
the
interest
of
the
government
is
very
strong.
but
in
the
second
step
of
the
mathews
test,
there's
a
recognition
that
additional
procedures
really
add
no
value
to
the
decision-making
process.
here
the...
the
government
needs
to
have
the
capacity
and
the...
the
ability
to
make
the
best
possible
decision
looking
at
a
whole
variety
of
factors,
and
to
have
a
procedure
put
in
place
by
the
court
that
requires
a
full
display
of
all
the
evidence
that
will
be
presented
at
the
time
of
hearing,
as
incorporated
in
the
notice
to
the
inmate
that
a
hearing
will
be
held,
and
then
an
acknowledge
that
there's...
only
this
evidence
is
the
evidence
that...
that
is
being
relied
upon
really
presents
essentially
a
fact-finding
hearing
where
the
hearing
process
that
is
set
forth
in
new
policy
111-07
is
more
than
just
fact-finding.
it's
kind
of
an
analysis.
it
gets
an
opportunity...
provides
an
opportunity
to
really
assess
the
attitude
of
the
inmate,
the...
the
risks
that
are
involved
in...
in
placement
in
a...
in
a
different
level
in
a
different
penitentiary.
it
is
directed
at
protecting
the
safety
and
the
security
of
the
inmates
and,
obviously,
of
protecting
the...
the
safety
of
the
personnel.
and
it
is
fully
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents.
in
applying
the
mathews
test--
mr.
james
m.
petro
--thank
you.
