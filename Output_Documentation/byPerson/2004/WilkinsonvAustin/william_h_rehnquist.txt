argument
now
in
no.
04-495,
reginald
wilkinson
v.
charles.
e.
austin.
general
petro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
general
petro,
i
for
one
would
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
the
question
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
petro.
ms.
maynard,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
maynard.
mr.
lobel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
would
you
tell
us
what
happened
in
mr.
austin's
case?
i
mean,
did
he
get
a
notice
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
answer
my
question
first?
what
kind
of
notice,
if
any,
did
mr.
austin
get?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
trial
before
all
the...
before
they
were
about
to
be
committed
or
the
hearing
at
which
it
was
determined
whether
they
would
be
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's...
what's
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
if
he
can...
if
he's
not
a
gang
leader,
he
can
tell
them
why
he
isn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
want
a
trial-type
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
happening
under
the
new
policy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
you
just
were
going
to
say
here's
what
was
happening.
do
you
mean
under
the
new
policy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
is
that
the
question?
if
the
new
policy
meets
constitutional
standards,
why
does
it
have
to
fix
something
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the
due
process
clause
require
reasons?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
was
a
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
wrong
with
giving
him
the
opportunity
to
say
why
he's
not
a
gang
leader?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
can
you
know
whether
the
problems
are
ongoing
if
the
new
rules
haven't
been
implemented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
why
isn't
it
a
question
of
as
facially
in
the
abstract
is
it
okay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do...
where
do
we
find
those
findings?
where
in
the
record
do
we
find
the
findings
about
individual
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
petro,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
petro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
in
wilkinson
against
austin
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
