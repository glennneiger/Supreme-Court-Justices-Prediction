that...
but
that's
what...
that's
what
you
wanted
to
talk
about,
but
we're
on,
first,
the
preliminary
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is...
i
think
you
started
to
say
that
you
regarded
atypical
and
significant
as
a
fact-finding
which
was
made
against
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--based
on
the
extreme
conditions
of
this
kind
of
confinement
where
you
don't
see
another
human.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
how
long?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
perhaps
we
can
be
concrete.
if
he...
suppose
the
charge
is
he
is
a
gang
leader.
will
he
get
notice
that
says
you
are
being
considered
for
reclassification
because
you
are
a
gang
leader?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
that
he's
been
reclassified,
but
is
the
reason...
the
reason
that
you
are
being
reclassified
is
that
you
are
a
gang
leader.
those...
those
words,
you
are
a
gang
leader.
will
he
get
those?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
a
predictive
judgment
that
a
person
is
a
gang
leader?
the
ultimate
decision,
given
the
facts
and
circumstances,
we
predict
that
this
person
is
among
the
worst
of
the
worst,
but
the
findings
that
have
to
be
made
along
the
way
are
not
necessarily
predictive.
i
mean,
it...
it
would
be
nice
if
the...
if
the
issues
came
simply
divided
what
happened
in
the
past,
what
might
happen
in
the
future,
but
the
judgment
that's
made
to
classify
someone
as
5
inevitably
involves
some,
well,
what
happened
in
the
past
on
the
basis
of
which
we
can
project
what
might
happen
in
the
future.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
what
happened
question,
not
what
might
happen.
what
happened,
the
determination
might
be
made
on
the
basis
of
rumor
or
innuendo.
my
only
point
is
that
questions
don't
come
labeled
so
simply,
predictive
versus
what
happened
in
the
past.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
suppose
neither
of
those
are...
are
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
ask
for...
did
the
government
move
for
modification
of
a
decree?
i...
i
assume
that
it
was
not
a
decision
of
this
court.
you
said
this...
what
you
do
in
the
supermax
at
the
federal
level
has
been
imposed
by
a
court.
which
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
talked
about
something
being
imposed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
i
want
to
know
what
was
imposed,
first,
by
whom,
by
which
court,
and
what...
what
the
order
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
so,
i
mean,
you
were
saying
this
was
forced
on...
on
the...
effectively
on
the
government.
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
that
were
the
case,
you
would,
after
this
court
rendered
the
decisions
it
did
in
hewitt
and
sandin,
say,
seventh
circuit,
please
reconsider.
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
haven't
done
that
so
you
probably
think
it's
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
is...
isn't
there
the
problem...
at
least
ohio
suggested
that
there
is...
that
if
this
person
is
indeed
a
gang
leader
and
the
form
says
so-and-so
and
so-and-so
effectively
ratted
on
you,
those
persons
who
came
forward
might
not
live
to
see
another
day?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
was
never...
never
in
effect,
right?
the
new
policy--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
all...
the
evidence
relates
to
the
old
policy
which
i
think
ohio
recognizes
was
not
adequate.
and
then
there's...
ohio
has
this
new
policy,
and
you,
just
on
the
basis
of
the
written
statement
of
the
policy,
made
the
judgment
that
it's
not
good
enough.
