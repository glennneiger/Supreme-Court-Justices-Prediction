is
the
form,
and
if
you
look
at
that,
you'll
see
that
it
has
a
line
that
says,
you
are
being
considered
for
a
transfer
for
the
following
reasons,
colon,
and
there's
a
blank
to
be
filled
in.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
procedures
that
ohio
provides
for
placement
into
its
supermax
prison
facility
are
more
than
ample
to
satisfy
due
process.
as
the
federal
government
has
argued
in
its
brief,
the
bureau
of
prisons
believes
there
is
no
liberty
interest
implicated
here.
but
even
if
one
assumes
that
there
is,
the
type
of
decision
at
issue
is
inherently
a
predictive
one
that
turns
on
the
holistic
judgment
of
prison
officials.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
we
would
have
three
responses
to
that.
one
is
first
in
ohio,
as
in
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
in
the
large
majority
of
instances,
most
of
the
facts
upon
which
a
predictive
assessment
would
turn
have
already
been
subject
to
some
more
formal
type...
trial-type
procedure.
for
example,
in
the
bureau
of
prisons,
the
vast
majority
of
prisoners
who
are
placed
in
one
of
our
two
more
restrictive
facilities
have
committed
some
violent
act
in
prison
for
which
they
have
been
found
to
be
guilty
pursuant
to
formal
wolff-type,
trial-type
procedures.
secondly,
with
respect
to
facts
that
might
be
taken
into
consideration
for
which
there
hasn't
yet
been
such
a
formal
trial-type
proceeding,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
when
you're
talking
about
the
types
of
predictive
risk
assessments
that
are
at
issue
here,
it
is
appropriate
for
prison
officials,
using
their
expertise
and
judgment
and
knowledge
of
the
prison
conditions
in
their
prison
and
in
the
prison
system
as
a
whole,
to
take
into
account
things
that
are
rumor,
innuendo,
and
other
imponderables
that
may
not
have
been
proven
in
any
fact-type
proceeding.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
true.
i
agree
with
that.
but
again,
i
believe
that
most
of
the...
the
facts
upon
which
these
decisions
are
based
and...
and
ohio
asserts
in
its
brief
that
that's
the
case
in
their
case
too,
that
people
who
are
placed
in
level
5
have
either
been
subject
of
a
rule
board's
infraction
hearing
or
have
committed
a
crime
for
which
they've
been
convicted
while
in
prison.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
i...
as
i
say,
i
think
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
in
both
the
federal
system
and
ohio,
that
is
the
case.
but
even
so,
the
consideration
at
issue
takes
into
a
broader
spectrum
of
consideration
than
just
the
individual
inmate.
having
the
type
of
formal
fact-finding
retrospective
proceeding
that
the
court
below
required
here
is
going
to
focus
the
decision-maker
in
the
wrong
direction
and
on
a
more
narrow
set
of
facts
than
ideally
we
want
the
prison
administrators
to
focus
upon.
we
want
them
to
be
looking
at,
just
like
in
hewitt,
the
relationship
of
this
inmate
to
other
inmates,
of
inmates
within
the
prison
generally,
of
inmates
to
this
inmate,
and
the
safety
of
others.
so
there's
more
of
them
at
stake.
there
are
other
private
interests
at
stake
besides
those
of
the
individual
who
may
be
moved
in
the
prison
administration's--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes.
we
believe
that
the
procedures
that
ohio
provides
are...
are
more
than
adequate
because
it
gives
the
prisoner
notice
of
the
charges
and
an
opportunity
to
contest
the
placement
decision.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
the...
the
process
that
ohio
provides
is
more
than
is
necessary
to
satisfy
due
process.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
it
is,
justice
scalia.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
there's...
still,
the
appropriate
analysis,
when
you're
talking
about...
basically
what
we
have
at
bottom--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
seems
to
me
that
you
hold
that...
that
the
procedures
here
are
adequate
because...
under
the
due
process
clause
because
in
the
broad
range
of
cases,
you're
going
to
have
sufficient
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
contest.
again,
i
think
it's
really
important
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
decision
issued
here.
it's
really
a
gestalt
judgment
of
prison
officials
exercising
their
expertise
in
an
area
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
prison
officials
get
a
wide
range
of
deference.
again,
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
about
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
because
the
respondents
have
pointed
to
our
control
unit
procedures
which
are
more
trial-like.
and
i
just
want
to
let
the
court
know
that
those
procedures
were
imposed
upon
the
federal
government
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
pursuant
to
a
court
order
in
1978
before
this
court
issued
its
decision
in
cases
such
as
hewitt
where
the
court
made
clear
this
distinction
about
prison
placement
and
issues
involving
the
judgment
and
predictive
decisions
of
prison
administrators.
when
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
been--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--let
me
clarify
one
thing.
what...
it
would
be...
this
relates
only
to
the
control
unit,
which
is
now
at...
at...
in...
in
part
of
the
adx
florence
facility.
it
does
not
apply
to
the
general
populations
of
the
adx
florence
facility
and
the
marion
facility.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
right.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
injunction
was
entered
by
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
and
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
case
called
bono
v.
saxby.
and
the
federal
court...
the...
the
bureau
of
prisons
adopted
the
regulations
pointed
to
by
the
respondents
in
the
c.f.r.
as
it...
in...
in...
to
comply
with
that
injunction.
we
have
not
yet
sought
to
have
that
injunction
set
aside,
but
those
procedures
apply
to
a
very
small
number
of
federal
prisoners.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
we
don't
think
it's
constitutionally
required,
justice
ginsburg.
it
hasn't...
we
haven't
moved
to
set
it
aside
because
it
hasn't
caused
an
administrative
burden.
there
are
currently
only
49
inmates
in
the
control
unit
at
florence.
in
the
last
decade,
we
have
only
placed
118
inmates
there,
and
so
we
were
able
to
cope
with
these
burdensome
procedures
with
respect
to
those
numbers.
but
it's
important
to
note
that
what
we
do
when
we...
what
the
bureau
of
prisons
does
when
it
was
free
to
decide
its
own
process
is
detailed
at
pages
26
to
28
of
our
brief,
and
that
applies
to
a
large
number
of
prisoners,
550
who
are
in
the
general
populations
of...
in
very
similar
conditions
to
those
in
the
ohio
state
penitentiary.
and
there
we
have
adopted
a
much
less
formal
process
even
than
the
one
that
ohio
does,
and
we
believe
that
is
also
constitutionally
sufficient.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it
is...
applies
to
the
general
conditions
in
adx...
the
general
populations
in
adx
florence
and
usp
marion.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
those
conditions,
your
honor,
are
similar
to
the
ohio
state
penitentiary.
the
difference
between...
may
i
finish,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the...
the
difference
in
the
general
population,
the
prisoners
are
out
10
to
12
hours
a
week
for
recreation,
and
in
the
control
unit,
they
are
out
7
hours
a
week.
