justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
there
is
a...
there
is
a
question
of
law
involved
as
to
whether
there's
a
liberty
interest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
sandin
case
in
1995,
this
court
said
that
prisoners
have
a
state-created
liberty
interest
only
where
the
deprivation
or
restraint
imposes
atypical
and
significant
hardship
on
the
inmate
in
relation
to
the
ordinary
incidents
of
prison
life.
now,
i
guess
to
be
categorized
in
category
5
in
your
state,
it
does
involve
putting
someone
in
solitary
confinement,
reducing
their
time
for
exercise,
and
reducing
their
options
for
parole.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the...
why
don't
you
simplify
it
by
telling
us
whether
you
take
the
position
today
that
there
is
or
is
not
a
liberty
interest
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
you
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
you
your
opinion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it
should
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
this
is
a
prison
classification,
for
goodness
sakes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he's
been
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
prison.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
question
is
what
procedures
are
required.
and
we've
given
a
lot
of
discretion
in
prison
administration.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
was...
was
this
under
the
old
policy
that
you're
talking
about
what
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
i
thought
that
we
had
to
address
this
facial
challenge
insofar
as
it
affects
the
new
policy.
and
if
the
state
complied
with
the
new
policy,
what
is
your
complaint
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let...
you
keep
talking
about
what
happened
in
the
past,
and
i'm...
i
find
some
difficulty
with
that
because
we're
being
asked
to
review
a
new
policy.
and
i
would
like
you
to
look
at
the
new
policy,
show
us
where
to
find
it
in
the
record,
and
tell
us
specifically
what's
wrong
with
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could...
could
you
refer
to
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where...
where
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
i'm
on
23.
what
are
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
form
58...
i'm...
i'm
looking
at
page
58...
says
that
the
prisoner
will
be
given
this
form
that
says
you
were
referred
to
the
classification
committee
for
the
following
reasons.
and
that
leaves
space
to
be
filled
out.
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
a
facial
attack.
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
that,
saying
you
were
referred
for
the
following
reasons
and
leaving
space
to
have
it
filled
out?
is
that
defective
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
showed
what
happened
in
the
past.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
can
understand
that
you
could
come
on
behalf
of
a
prisoner
on
an
as-applied
challenge,
but
to
look
at
this
form
and
tell
us
it
is
facially
invalid
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand.
if...
if
there
are
specific
incidents
where
something
was
defective,
then
challenge
it,
but
what's
the
matter
with
the
form?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
form
says,
state
the
reasons,
and
leaves
blank
space
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what's
the
matter?
