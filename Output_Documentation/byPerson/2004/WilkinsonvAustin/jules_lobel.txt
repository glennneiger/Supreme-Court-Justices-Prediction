mr.
jules
lobel
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
may...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
many
of
the
cases...
and
i...
i
will
try
to...
in
mr.
austin's
case
and
many
of
the
other
cases,
people
didn't
get
a
notice.
i'd
like
to
try
to
explain
what
they
get
and
what
they
don't
get.
first,
they
do
not
get
a
final
decision
which
gives
them
reasons.
mr.
jules
lobel
i
think
mr.
austin
got
no
notice.
mr.
jules
lobel
okay.
the
notice
they
get
at
the
beginning
is
an...
a
notice
which
sometimes
includes
the
reasons,
sometimes
it
doesn't
include
the
reasons.
what
the
requirement
in
this
policy
is
and
what
was
found
at
trial
was
that
often
they
would
get
very
vague
reasons
like
you're
a
gang
member
or
a
gang
leader.
now--
mr.
jules
lobel
--yes,
that
they
don't
get.
that
they
do
not
get.
mr.
jules
lobel
i
think
you're
reading
in
the
wrong
place.
but
it...
there...
they
do
attach
something,
but
it's
not
that
long
form.
that
long
form
is
what
was
never
given
to
the
prisoners
which
would
tell
them
what
it
is
that
they
were
said
to
have
done.
for
example,
if--
mr.
jules
lobel
--they
do
not.
the
form
that
starts
at
ja-58
they
get,
but
the
form
that
starts
at
ja-58
is
only
one
page.
it's
ja-58.
they
get
that
form.
that
form
says
you'll
tell
them
the
reasons.
mr.
jules
lobel
so
at
this...
at...
at...
during
the
trial,
often
they
didn't
get
the...
they
didn't
get
any
notice.
mr.
jules
lobel
but
now
they
should
get
a
notice.
it
should
tell
them
some
reason.
the
problem
at
trial
was
that--
mr.
jules
lobel
--at
the
hearing
and...
they
got
a
notice.
the
notice
said
you're
a
gang
leader.
how
is
a
man
supposed
to
respond
to
a
vague
notice
that
i'm
a
gang
leader
when
he
doesn't
know
what
it
is
that
they
are
saying
is
their...
is
the
reason
that
he's
a
gang
leader?
all
he
could
say...
this
isn't
like
a
trial.
it's
not
a
trial-type
procedure.
what
happens
in
reality--
mr.
jules
lobel
--no.
mr.
jules
lobel
no.
we're
not--
mr.
jules
lobel
--right,
and
we're
not--
mr.
jules
lobel
--and...
and
we
are
not
asking
for
trial-type
procedures.
all
we're
asking
for
is
very
minimal
due
process,
which
is
that
the
person
comes
before
a
committee
of
three
correction
officials,
and
they
say,
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself?
they
don't
present
any
evidence.
they
don't
present
witnesses.
they
say,
you're
a
gang
leader.
what
do
you
have
to
say
for
yourself?
mr.
jules
lobel
no.
mr.
jules
lobel
that's...
that's
the
district
court's
order.
that's
not
what
they...
that's
the
revised
policy
under
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
jules
lobel
where
is
theirs?
mr.
jules
lobel
their
policy
is,
i
believe,
on
page
ja-23.
that
tells
you
what
they...
they
say.
he
is
to
be
served
with
a
notice
of
hearing
form
48
hours
prior
to
the
hearing.
that
will...
that...
there
were
problems
with
this.
one
is
very
vague
notice.
you're
a
gang
leader.
they
have
evidence
for
why
he's
a
gang
leader.
in
mr.
roe's
case,
who's
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
the
evidence
which...
which
was
never
told
to
the
prisoner...
the
committee
didn't
even
know
the
evidence.
the
evidence
was
that
he
was
hit
over
the
head
with
a
spatula
while
he
was
waiting
on
line
at
the
maximum
security
lunch
line,
and
he
went
to
the
hospital,
and
he
never
fought
back.
and
from
this,
somebody
determined
that
he
was
a
gang
leader
because
the
people
who
were
being
targeted
at
that
time
were
gang
leaders.
now,
if
you
take
a
man
and
say,
come
before
a
committee,
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
what
this
is
about,
just
that
you're
a
gang
leader,
what
do
you
have
say
for
yourself--
mr.
jules
lobel
--because--
mr.
jules
lobel
--he'll
say
i'm
not
a
gang
leader.
but
if
they
know
and
the
reason
is
because
he
was
involved
in
this
fight,
which...
in
which
he
didn't
fight
back,
he
should
be
able
to
then
say,
well,
this
guy...
you're
wrong.
this
guy
beat
me
up
because
i
insulted
him,
or
he's
been
an
enemy
of
mine.
he
has
something
to
respond.
otherwise,
he
can
just
say
i'm
not
a
gang
leader.
mr.
jules
lobel
this
is
a
far
cry
from
a
trial.
a
trial...
the
state
would
have
to
put
on
witnesses.
they'd
have
to
prove
something.
all
you're
doing
here
is
saying
to
the
man,
we're
going
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
respond.
and
the
question
is,
do
you
have
to
give
them
notice
detailed
enough?
and
that's
all
the
district
court
required
was
some
summary
so
that
it's
detailed
enough
so
that
he
can
respond.
and
really,
all
they
have
to
do
is
take
that
form
that
they
print
up,
justice
breyer,
which
you
were
looking
at,
that
long
form,
and
copy
it
and
append
it
to
the
notice.
mr.
jules
lobel
and
the
district
court
ordered
what
ohio
does
in
all
its
disciplinary
proceedings,
what
the
federal
government
does
in
its
disciplinary
proceedings,
which
is
if
it's
confidential
information,
you
don't
have
to
turn
it
over
because
they
understand
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
district
court
understood
that.
but
in
mr.
roe's
case,
it
wasn't
confidential
that
he
was
hit
over
the
head.
or
in
mr.
thompson's
case,
it
wasn't
confidential
that
they
said
to
him,
you
were
present
at
some
fight
and
they
didn't
tell
who
he
was
fighting
and
they
never
were...
they
never
gave
him
any
of
the...
the
details
so...
to
be
able
to
respond.
if
it's
confidential,
they
don't
have
to
turn
it
over.
the
district
court--
mr.
jules
lobel
--yes,
your
honor.
it
was
under--
mr.
jules
lobel
--the...
the
new
policy,
which
really
was
in
all
honesty,
your
honor,
a
tweaked
policy
or
a
modified
policy...
they
took
the
old
policy
and
they
made
some
changes
to
it.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
that
new
policy
fixed
the
problems.
we
saw
the
problems--
mr.
jules
lobel
--never
went
into
effect.
mr.
jules
lobel
it
doesn't
on...
just
on
the
face
of
it,
it
doesn't
fix
the
problem
that
the
district
court
found.
vague
notice.
the
other
thing
they
would
do
is
they
would
give
the
person
notice
of
one
reason--
mr.
jules
lobel
--i'll
give
you
a
very
specific--
mr.
jules
lobel
--page...
look
at
page
22
and...
23
and
33
of
the
new
policy.
look
at
23.
mr.
jules
lobel
ja-23.
look
at
ja-23
and
look
at
ja-33.
mr.
jules
lobel
on
23,
you
look
at
the
final
decision-maker...
the
bureau
of
classification...
the
bottom
line
of
the
next-to-the-last
paragraph...
will
review
the
recommendation
and
any
objections
filed
and
make
a
final
decision.
now,
here's
what
was
happening,
and
i--
mr.
jules
lobel
--that's
the
new
policy.
mr.
jules
lobel
no.
the
question
is
whether
this
page
23
fixes
what
was
happening
in
the
past.
this
is
their
new
policy.
mr.
jules
lobel
your
honor,
it
doesn't
meet
constitutional
standards
because
it
only
says
the
chief
has
to
make
a
final
decision.
the
chief
doesn't
have
to
give
any
reasons
for
it,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
this
court
in
predictive
decisions,
in
punitive
decisions
where
a...
a
decision-maker
can
send
somebody
to
solitary
confinement
long-term.
and
justice
souter,
it's
for
at
least
2
years.
over
200
people
there
were
for
more
than
3
years,
which
was
really
the...
the...
only
limited
by
how
long
the
building
was
open...
and
say,
i'm
putting
you
in
there
and
i'm
not
telling
you
why.
and
this
policy
lets
them
do
it,
and
that's
what
they
were
doing.
and
there's
nothing
in
this
policy
to
change
that.
and
what
was
happening--
mr.
jules
lobel
--exactly.
mr.
jules
lobel
exactly.
mr.
jules
lobel
he's
been
charged
for
being
a
gang
leader.
mr.
jules
lobel
and
they
don't
have
to
give
that
to
anybody.
mr.
jules
lobel
and
all
the
district
court
was
saying--
mr.
jules
lobel
--they
didn't
give
them
the
information.
mr.
jules
lobel
exactly.
and
that
is
why
it's
facially
invalid.
but
if
you
look
at
what
was
happening,
you
could--
mr.
jules
lobel
--and...
two
problems
with
that.
it
could
either
say
you're
a
gang
leader,
and
second,
it
could
say
which--
mr.
jules
lobel
--because
you...
at
trial
we
showed
what
the
practice
was.
mr.
jules
lobel
and
the
question
is,
does
this
fix
it?
and
what
happened
in
the
past
was
they
gave,
for
example,
a
prisoner,
and
it
said,
here
are
the
reasons.
the
reason
is
you
stabbed
somebody.
the
committee
said,
you
stabbed
somebody.
it
wasn't
very
bad.
we
recommend
that
you
not
be
put
in
the
place.
in
over
50
percent
of
the
cases
of
those
committee
recommendations
on
retention,
the
chief
rendered
a
decision,
without
giving
a
final...
any
real
reasons,
and
used
evidence
and
reasons
which
were
never
given
to
the
inmate.
in
ohio's
brief,
they
say
we
could
still
do
that.
we
only
have
to
give
them
some
reason.
for
example,
we
have
to
say
you're
a
gang
member.
if
it
turns
out
that
you're...
turns
out
you're
not
a
gang
member,
the
chief
can
say
later
on,
well,
you
were
dealing
drugs.
that's...
that's
not
adequate.
facially
it's
not
adequate
to
give
the
person
some
reason
and
then
switch
the
reason
in
the
middle
of
the
game.
and
that's
what
was
happening.
mr.
jules
lobel
well...
well,
the
first
thing
that's
matter
with
the
form
is
it
doesn't
require
reasons
for
the
decision.
mr.
jules
lobel
even
in
salerno,
the...
the...
this
court
held
that
in
a
preventive
case,
the
bail...
the
bail
reform
statute
still
requires,
as
a
basic
modicum
of
due
process,
that
you
give
the
person
the
reason--
mr.
jules
lobel
--that
was
a
statute,
and
the
court
relied
on
that
for
why
the
statute
was
constitutional.
even
in
greenholtz,
the
parole
case,
the...
this
court
said
over
and
over
again
that
in
the...
in
the
parole
decision,
which
is
much
more
predictive
than
here,
the
parole
board
gave
its
reasons
for
why
it--
mr.
jules
lobel
--but
that's--
mr.
jules
lobel
--that's
in
the
notice.
it's
not
in...
it's
not
in
the
decision.
mr.
jules
lobel
yes.
your
honor,
it
depends--
mr.
jules
lobel
--it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
midway.
on
the
eve
of
trial,
as
we
approached
the
trial
court
for
trial,
they
promulgated
the
new
policy
which
was
not
supposed
to
be
implemented
until
several
months
after
trial.
and
it
seems
in
that
situation
perfectly
reasonable
for
a
district
court
to
say,
here
are
the
problems
that
i've
uncovered.
i'm
going
to
look
at
the
new
policy
and
see
if
this
new
policy
fixes
it.
the...
the
problems
were
not
moot,
justice
o'connor.
these
were
ongoing
problems.
there
were
200
prisoners
who
were
there
under
a
deficient
policy.
the
question
then
was,
were
they
entitled
to
something
better?
and
did
this
new
policy
give
them
something
better?
and
the...
the
district
court
found,
i
think
quite
correctly,
that
it
gave
them
a
little
better.
it
was
tweaked.
it
was
modified.
but
on
some
of
the
basic
questions
of
whether
or
not
you
can
bait
and
switch
the
reasons,
whether
you
could
tell
somebody
you're
in
here
for
drugs
and
then
the
classification
chief
could...
could
put
him
in
for
something
else,
or
whether
you
had
to
give
them
some
reason
that
he
can
respond
to...
in
a
situation
where
you're
not
having
a
trial,
mr.
chief
justice,
where...
where
the
state
does
not
have
to
come
forward
with
any
evidence.
the
only
evidence
the
person
is
getting
of
what
is
his
problem
is
this
notice.
and
the
question
is,
when
that
is
the
only
evidence...
it's
not
like
a
trial
like
in
the
federal
courts
where
you
have
to
present
witnesses,
you
have
to
meet
a
standard
of
proof.
it's
not
even
in
the...
like
a
disciplinary
trial
where
you
have
to
meet
a
certain
standard
of
proof
and
present
witnesses.
the
committee
sits
there.
the
guy
comes
in
and
they
say
to
him,
tell
us
why
you're
not
a
gang
leader.
and
he
says,
well,
tell
me
why
you
think
i
am
a
gang
leader.
and
they
should
be
forced
to
tell
him
that.
mr.
jules
lobel
how
is
mr.
roe
going
to
say
i'm
not
a
gang
leader
because
i
wasn't
hit
over
the
head
with
a
spatula
because
i'm
a
gang
leader,
i
was
hit
over
the
head
with
a
spatula
because
the
guy
doesn't
like
me,
unless
he
knows
that
that's
why
they
think
he
is
a
gang
leader?
how
could
he
respond
to
that?
all
he
could
say
is
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
jules
lobel
your
honor,
i
think
as
a
facial
matter,
when
you're
putting
somebody
in
long-term
solitary
confinement
for
years
and
years
in
a
small
cell
with
no
possibility
of
parole,
you're...
i
think
you
should
give
them
notice
of
the
reasons
in
sufficient--
mr.
jules
lobel
--in
sufficient
detail.
mr.
jules
lobel
right.
mr.
jules
lobel
right.
mr.
jules
lobel
even
if,
as
an
abstract
matter,
you
could
assume
it,
when
you've
had
a
1-week
trial
with
witness
after
witness,
and
the
witnesses
say
they're
not
doing
this--
mr.
jules
lobel
--but
the
new
policy
is
introduced
at
trial.
and
the...
the
question
is...
really
what
you're
saying,
justice
breyer,
is
the
mere
introduction
of
the
new
policy
renders
the
whole
case...
case
moot.
mr.
jules
lobel
maybe
you
should
in
an
ordinary
case.
where
there's
been
a
trial
and
it's
a
clear
pattern
and
practice
that
they're
not,
then
i
think
that
friends
of
the
earth
v.
laidlaw
says
that
you
have
to
show
that
the
new
policy
is
going
to
cure
the
problem.
mr.
jules
lobel
that's
certainly
one
way.
mr.
jules
lobel
but
to
look
at
it
the
second
way,
you
have
to
show
that
the
problems
proved
at
trial
were
moot.
if
the
problems
are
ongoing,
then
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
a
remedy.
you
can't
say
that
there
are
problems
that
are
ongoing,
which
there
were...
they
were
all--
mr.
jules
lobel
--well,
they
are
ongoing
at
trial.
when
the
trial
judge
renders
his
decision,
they're
ongoing.
the
question
then
is
looking
at
this
abstractly,
it's
not
a
question
of
in
the
abstract
is
it
okay,
but
in
the
abstract
will
it
cure
the
problems.
mr.
jules
lobel
yes.
well,
as
i
said,
facially
in
the
abstract,
i
think
it's
not
okay
because
i
think
they
should
have
final
decision
with
reasons
and
notice
with
sufficient
detail
for
reasons.
but
even
if
you
don't
agree
with
me
on
that,
i
think
that
this
case,
when
you
have
an...
when
you
have
a
trial
and
there's
a
pattern
and
practice
of...
of
problems,
i
don't
think
that
it's
proper
to
simply
assume
that
a
piece
of
paper
which
says
we'll
give
reasons
is
adequate
when
the
reasons
that
they're
giving
and
that
the
trial
shows
they're
giving
are
inadequate.
they're
vague.
they're...
they're
shifting
the
ball
on
people.
and
i...
and
i
think--
mr.
jules
lobel
--there...
there
were
findings
that...
that
there
were...
particular
inmates
were
improperly...
were
sent
with
no
evidence
against
them.
mr.
jules
lobel
no.
the
district
court
simply
ordered
that
since
there
was
a
widespread
showing
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
placement
and...
and
that
there
was
a
showing
that
they
built
the
prison
for
500...
with
500
cells
and
they
didn't
need
500
cells
and
they
were
putting
people
in
there
who
didn't
need...
who
didn't
meet
the
criteria
that
they
set
forward...
there
was
a
widespread
showing
of
that.
the
district
court
said
you
should
give
them
new
hearings
following
a
procedure
which
would
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
constitutional
due
process
clause.
mr.
jules
lobel
no.
the...
the
state
never
implemented
the
new
policy.
the
court
said
what
you
should
do
is
give
them
hearings,
which
give
them
notice
sufficient
to
explain
what's
going
on,
render
a
final
decision
which
explains
what's
going
on,
give
them
a
chance
to
produce
witnesses
if
they
have
a...
if
they
have
witnesses,
and
they
gave
them
hearings--
mr.
jules
lobel
--that's
right
because
the
district
court
didn't
move
any
particular
prisoner.
but
what
happened
was
when
you--
mr.
jules
lobel
--they're...
they're
all
through
the
district
court's
opinion.
if
you
want
to
look
at
mr.
roe,
it's
at
73
to
76.
mr.
thompson
is
at
77
to
79.
all
of
these
were
cases
where
the
district
court
found
people
are
being
put
in
here
on
no
evidence
or
essentially
no
evidence.
mr.
jules
lobel
for
all
the
prisoners.
several...
several
months
later,
there
were
new
hearings.
and
what
happened
then
was
that
the
amount
of
prisoners
at
this
prison
went
from
330
to
where
it
is
right
now,
which
is
48,
the
same
in
the
federal
control...
as
in
the
federal
control
unit.
mr.
jules
lobel
we're
talking
about
48
prisoners.
mr.
jules
lobel
yes.
mr.
jules
lobel
no.
mr.
jules
lobel
we
argued
here
that
this
was
an
atypical,
significant
hardship
compared
not
to
level
1,
2,
3,
or
4,
but
compared
to
the
segregation
units,
any
other
prison
in
ohio,
even
the
segregation
units,
and
for
three
reasons,
all
of
which
in
combination
the
court
of...
the
district
court
held
required
a
finding
of
liberty
interest.
one,
it's
long-term,
indefinite.
there
were
over
200
people
here
who
were
there
for
almost
as
long
as
the
building
was
open,
and
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
ever
going
to
get
out.
it
was
indefinite.
that's
very
different
than
sandin's
30-day
disciplinary
confinement.
mr.
jules
lobel
there
was
an
annual
review,
but
the
committee
that
they
set
up
to
review
it,
made
up
not
of
law
professors,
but
made
up
of
correctional
officials,
said--
mr.
jules
lobel
--and
a
good
thing,
i
agree.
i
would...
i
would
hate
to
be
doing
this.
but
made
up
of
wardens
and
deputy
wardens,
said
mr.
roe,
there's
no
reason
you
should
be
here,
you
should
get
out.
and
then
based
on
reasons
and
evidence,
which
mr.
roe
never
knew,
which
the
committee
never
knew...
the
committee
thought
mr.
roe
was
in
there
for
one
reason,
and
it
turned
out
on
trial
he
was
in
there
for
another
reason.
the
classification
chief
says
to
him...
says,
you're
going
to
stay
here
another
year.
mr.
roe
goes
back,
has
a
perfect
record,
does
every
program
he
can
do.
he
comes
back
to
the
committee.
the
committee
says,
mr.
roe,
you
should
get
out
of
here
again.
and
the
classification
chief
again
says,
i'm
sorry,
for
no
reason
i'm
just
going
to
keep
you
here.
and
at
that
point
you
say,
well,
mr.
roe,
you
may
be
here
for
the
rest
of
your
life,
and
there's
no...
this
is
not
definite
like
in
the
control
unit
where--
mr.
jules
lobel
--nothing.
mr.
jules
lobel
nothing.
mr.
jules
lobel
it
says
you
get
an
annual
review.
they
got
an
annual
review.
the
new
policy
doesn't
say.
and
what
the
district
court
ordered
was
draconian,
that
the
classification
chief,
after
he
does
this,
without
hearing
from
the
inmate,
without
giving
him
reasons,
has
to
write
a
final
decision,
which
gives
him
some
of
the
reasons
that
mr.
roe
is
being
kept
there,
and
that
they
have
to
tell
him,
like
they
told
the
prisoners
in...
in
greenholtz,
what
you
have
to
do
to
get
out.
what...
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
unreasonable.
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
a
one-paragraph
reason.
now,
that's
the
first
reason,
but
that's
not
the
only
reason.
the
state
officials
testified
that
this
was
qualitatively
different
than
any
other
prisoner,
that
the
level
of
restriction,
the
no
outdoor
recreation
for
many
years,
that
people
have
not
been
outside
for
years,
the
small
cell
with
solid
steel
doors
so
that
they
could
not
hardly
talk
to
anybody
or
see
anybody,
that
these
were
conditions--
mr.
jules
lobel
--they
had
reading
materials,
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
had
televisions
so
they
could
watch
their
favorite
programs.
but
they
had
nobody
to
talk
to.
and
we...
the
experiment
that
was
done
with
long-term
solitary
confinement,
which
this
court
itself
in
the
1890's
found
caused
people
to
go
crazy...
if
you
have
to
give
people
the
process
that
was
required
here
to
send
the
prisoner
to
a
mental
institution,
you
should
have
to
give
them
at
least
that
process
to
send
them
into
a
situation
which
is
going
to
send
them
to
the
mental
institution.
[laughter]
and
that's
what's
involved
here.
it's
a
qualitatively
different
type
of
experience.
and
the
seventh
circuit
in
u.s.
v.
johnson
said
you
cannot
sentence
somebody
to...
into
solitary
confinement
for
the
term
of
their
sentence
because
it's
a
qualitatively
different
type
of
experience.
it's
not
the
30
days
in
sandin.
it's
not
the
7
weeks
in
ewing.
this
is
qualitatively
different.
and
to
top
it
off,
the
third
reason
is
because
these
people
were
automatically
deemed
ineligible
for
parole.
and
justice
scalia,
in
sandin,
the
court
said
in
this
case
it's
not...
the...
the
prisoner
isn't
being
denied
parole.
well,
here
we
have
evidence
that
there
are
prisoners
who
were...
the
parole
board
said
we
will
release
you
on
parole.
all
you
have
to
do
is
get
out
of
the
supermax.
the
committee
says...
a
correctional
officials
says,
you're
ready
to
go.
mr.
jules
lobel
not--
mr.
jules
lobel
--yes,
but
a...
the
vast...
i
believe
it's
over
90
percent
of
the
people
who
were
in
this
prison
were
sentenced
under
the
old
rules,
under
the
old
parole
rules.
and
in
addition,
every
prisoner
who
got
sent
to
this
prison
was
delayed
parole
for
the
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
10
years
that
they
were
going
to
spend
at
this
prison.
so
every
prisoner
it
affected.
thank
you
very
much.
