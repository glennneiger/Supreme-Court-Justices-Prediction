justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
were
moved
from
level
1
to
level
5?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
isn't
the
comparison
the
entire
prison
population
rather
than
just
5
versus
4?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it...
is
it
your
view
that
we
should
consider
it
the
normal
practice
in
the
ohio
system
to
keep
people
in
solitary
for
23
hours
a
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
isn't
that
the
standard
of
reference
that
we
should
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we're...
we're
dealing
with
a
small
number
of
inmates
out
of
a
very
large
population,
but
isn't
the
frame
of
reference
for
telling
whether
it's
a
liberty
interest
a
comparison
to
the
large
population?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just...
is
the
procedure
you're
describing
the
procedure
that
was
reviewed
by
the
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
evidence
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
describes
exactly
what
you're
describing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
form...
and
the
form
is
in
the
record,
i
take
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
maynard,
before
you
start,
maybe
you
could
answer
the
question
i
tried
to
ask
at
the
end
of
his
argument.
where
in
the
record
is
the
report?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
lobel?
putting
aside
for
a
second
which
policy
we
look
at
and
so
forth,
were
there
findings
that
particular
inmates
were
improperly
sent
to
this
facility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
and
was
there
any...
any
order
saying
that
inmate
should
get
out
and
go
to
a
different
facility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
the
state
then
came
back
and
said
we're
putting
in
this
new
policy,
we
will
give
them
new
hearings
under
the
new
policy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
even
though...
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
even
though
there
had
findings
that
some
inmates
have
been
improperly...
had
had
inadequate
procedure
as
a
predicate
to
going
into
the
new
facility,
they
can
just
stay
there
until
the
litigation
is
over.
