justice
antonin
scalia
general
petro,
before
you
get
into
the
details
of
why...
why
you
think
the
process
here
was
all
that
was
due,
i'm...
i'm
more
concerned
about
the
preliminary
question
of
whether
there
was
a
liberty
interest
here.
i...
i
know
you
haven't
challenged
the
existence
of
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
lets
me
off
the
hook.
we...
we
had
a
case
some
years
ago
in
which
both
sides
apparently
wanted
the
statute
in
existence
and
they
conceded
in
the...
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
statute
existed
and
wanted
us
to
say
what
this
presumptively
existing
statute
said.
and
we
held,
since
there
was
serious
doubt
about
whether
the
statute
had
been
properly
enacted,
we
had
to
reach
that
question
first
because
we
were
not
going
to
speculate
on
what
a,
you
know,
hypothetical
statute
said.
and
i
think
you're
asking
us
to
do
sort
of
the
same
thing
here.
you're...
if...
you
know,
without
even
conceding
or...
the
government
doesn't
concede
anyway.
the
united
states
doesn't.
you're
asking
us
to
hold
that
if
this
is
covered
by
the
due
process
clause,
what
you've
given
here
is
enough.
but
i
don't...
i
don't
like
to
speculate
on...
on
hypothetical
questions
like
that.
and
it...
it
really
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
there's
a
liberty
interest
here
flies
in
the
face
of
our
more
reasoned
opinions
in
this
area,
especially
sandin
which...
which
has
some
language
that's...
that's
almost...
almost
right
on
point.
we
note
also
that
this...
where
is
it?
conner's
confinement
did
not
exceed
similar
but
totally
discretionary
confinement
in
either
duration
or
degree
of
restriction.
i...
i
don't
understand
how
this
person
has
a
liberty
interest
in
not...
in
not
being
put
in
a
maximum
security
facility.
presumably
you
could
put
all
your
prisoners
in
maximum
security.
i
mean,
you
don't
pull
their
fingernails
or
anything,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's...
there's
no
eighth
amendment
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
wanted
to,
you
could
put
all
of
your
prisoners
in
maximum
security.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
where
is
the
liberty
interest
here?
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand,
but
i
feel
like
something
of
a
fool
being
asked,
you
know,
justice
scalia,
if...
if
there
were
a
liberty
interest
here,
would
these
procedures
be
enough
to
secure
it.
that's
not
the
kind
of
work
i
usually
do.
i...
you
know,
i
usually
ask...
answer
real
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
solitary
confinement
involved
in
sandin?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
we
say
in
sandin
that
solitary
confinement
was...
was
not
enough
to...
to
create--
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
maynard,
this
is
a
class
action,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
what
if
for
some
of
the
prisoners,
maybe
a
majority
of
the
prisoners,
this...
this
reality
of
having
a
prior
factual
hearing
exists,
but
for
some
of
it,
it
doesn't?
what...
what
disposition
would
this
court
then
make
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
mean,
suppose
i
think
that
a...
a
trial-type
proceeding
is
necessary,
and
in
fact,
it's
been
given
for
most
of
the
people
in
this
class
action,
but
not
for
the
rest.
what
happens
to
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
there...
there
was
at
least
annual
review.
isn't...
wasn't
there
an
annual--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
a
good
thing
too.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
new
policy
say
about
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
the
annual
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
whole
class,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
class
action.
it's
just
a
few
of
them.
in
fact,
there's...
there's
no
more
parole
in
ohio,
as
i
understand
it.
