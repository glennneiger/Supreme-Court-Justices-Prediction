justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
it's
marginally
greater
than
4.
it's
not
marginally
greater
than
1
or
2
certainly.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the...
the
point
of
the
case
is
that
the
inmate
does
not
expect
to
be
put
in
solitary
confinement
for
23
or
23
and
a
half
hours
a
day
for
a
period
of
1,
2,
or
more
years
without
some
process
to
do
it
because
that
is
so
extraordinarily
onerous
and
so
different
from
the
general
run
of
incarceration
practice.
justice
david
h.
souter
30...
for
30
days
i
believe,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
1
year,
2
years,
3
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
typically
it
has
been
represented
maybe...
maybe
wrongly...
typically
it
has
been
represented
that
they
tend
to
be
in
there
for
a
year
or
2-year
periods.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in...
but
in
fact,
they
tend
to
be
in
there
for
the
extended
periods
of
time.
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may...
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
i
realize
that
there
is
a
predictive
element.
i
don't
think
anyone
disputes
that.
one
of
the
points
of
contention
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
even
the
new
policy
did
not
give
a...
an...
an
inmate
a
statement
of
the
charge
or
reason
for
the...
for
the
reclassification
to
5.
is...
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
notice
of
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
did
it
give
notice
of
the
reason
for
the
reclassification?
you
did
such
and
such.
you
are
such
and
such
kind
of
person,
a
gang
member.
does
it
tell
him
anything?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
not
the
evidence,
just
the
reason.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
know
that,
but
does
it
say
you're
being
reconsidered
for...
considered
for
reclassification
because
you
hit
somebody
over
the
head
or
because
you've
shown
that
you're
a
member
of
a
gang
or
some
other
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
he
has
the
opportunity.
do
you
actually
tell
him
you
are
about
to
be
reclassified
or
our
proposal
is
to
reclassify
you
because
you
violated
this
particular
regulation
by
this
particular
conduct?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
asking
you
what
you
tell
the
inmate,
not
what
initiates
your
process.
now,
please
answer
my
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
at
which
point
does
he
get...
at
which
point
does
he
get
access?
justice
david
h.
souter
general
petro,
i...
i
don't...
i'm
going
to
ask
you
a
very
tendentious
question,
but
it's
something
i
don't
want
to
make
a
mistake
about.
going
back
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
when
he
is
given
what
you
described
as
the
bare
bones
report
at
the
beginning
of
the
proceedings,
when
he
gets
the
48-hour
notice,
will
in
her
example
the
bare
bones
report
say
you
are
being
reconsidered
for
reclassification
because
you
are
believed
to
be
a
gang
leader?
does
he
get
the
gang
leader
information?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
i'm
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
not
worried
about
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
i
want
to
know
the
charge.
will
he
always
get
the
charge?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
in
the
gang
leader
example,
he
will
be
told
that
it's
because
he
is
accused
of
being
a
gang
leader
that
this
is
occurring.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is...
is
the
population
with
respect
to
which
you
have
adopted
the
far
more
lenient
process
a...
the
population
of
the
control
unit,
which
i
understand
is
comparable
to
the
unit
we're
talking
about
in
ohio,
or
is
it
with
respect
to
the
general
maximum
security
population
which
is
housed
in
conditions
less
onerous
than
the
control
unit?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i...
may
i...
i
just
want
to
make
sure.
there
is
then
a
direct
disagreement
of
fact
between
you
and
the
attorney
general.
i
understood
him
to
say
they
got
the
form
that
starts
at
ja-58,
and
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
they
don't.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
