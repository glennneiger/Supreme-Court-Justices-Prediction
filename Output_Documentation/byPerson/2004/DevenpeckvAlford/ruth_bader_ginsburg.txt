that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
lafave.
you
cited
lafave
in
your
brief
for
that
proposition.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
made
the
point,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
that
a
police
officer
in
washington
is
not
required
to
divulge
on
the
spot
the
reason
for
the
arrest.
what
is
the
point
at
which
the
arrestee
under
washington
law
is
entitled
to
know
the
cause
of
the
arrest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
is
it
at
the
arraignment
or
the...
at
the
earlier
booking
in
the
police
station?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it...
is
it...
is
the
time
when
the
arrestee
must
told
you
are
being
arrested
for
x
reason,
is
that
when
the
arrestee
appears
before
the
magistrate
or
is
it
earlier
when
he's
brought
into
the
police
station
and
he's
booked?
the
arrest
is
booked.
at
which
point?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
also
said
that
you
thought
this
case
is
distinguishable
on
the
legitimacy
of
taping
the
conversation
with
the
police
officer
on
the
highway.
why...
why
do
you
think
this
is
distinguishable
from
the
washington
intermediate
appellate
court
decision
that
the...
that
the...
that
alford
wanted
to
show
to
the
police
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
if
there's
been
any
instruction
in
the
state
of
washington
to
police
following
that
flora
decision
about
taping...
about
arresting
people
for
taping
conversations
with
police
officers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
flashing
headlights
which
was...
there
was
a
citation.
there
was
an
arrest
for
the
tape
recording
and
a
citation
for
the
flashing
headlights.
could
there
have
been
a...
an
arrest
for
the
flashing
headlights,
or
is
that
a
lesser
category
of
offense
that's
not
an
arrestable
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
was
never...
never
charged
with
the
impersonating
an
officer,
only
with
the
flashing
headlights.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
subjective?
i
mean,
in...
in
whren,
the
question
was
finding
a
hidden
motive
as
distinguished
from
the
motive
that
was
written
out.
here,
there's
nothing
subjective
about
what
the
officer
charged
this
person
with
on
the
spot.
he
told
him.
there
wasn't
anything
hidden
in
his
mind.
he
said,
i'm
arresting
you
for
x
reason,
for
tape
recording.
and
then
they
had
a
whole
colloquy.
so
what
the...
what
the
arrest
was
for
is
as
objective
as
it
can
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
predicted
that
this
would
be
in
practice
very
bad.
there
are
some
jurisdictions
that
have
the
closely
related
test,
are
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
outside
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
whether
these
horribles
have
occurred
there,
that
the
police
are
booking
for
everything?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
they're
told
in
this
case
that
they're
subject
to
1983
liability
out
of
their
own
pockets
if
they
get
it
wrong,
then
it
seems
to
me
they
would
pursue
the
safe
course
and
say
nothing.
i
mean,
you
did
say
at
one
point
in
your
brief
that
when
a
warrantless
arrest
is
effected,
the
officer
must
inform
the
arrestee
of
the
officer's
authority
and
cause
of
arrest.
but
that's
not
true
on
the
spot
as
a
matter
of
washington
law
or
constitutional
law,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you're
not
urging
that
the
constitution
requires
the
officer
on
the
spot
to
state
the
cause
of
the
arrest,
or
are
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
that
the
reason
that
the
police
went
after
your
client
after
he
left
the
vehicle
that
was
disabled
was
because
the
officers
at
that
point
suspected
that
he
might
be
impersonating
a
police
officer.
that's
what
the
people
in
the...
the
disabled
vehicle
told
the
officer.
they
said
he
had
flashing
headlights.
we
thought
he
was
a
police
officer.
and...
and
wasn't
the
original
following
of
your
client
triggered
by
the
suspicion
that
he
might
be
impersonating
a
police
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
you
have
a
very
narrow
view
of
closely
related.
it
comes
down
to
misnomer
cases.
it's
one
thing
to
say...
what
the
officers
told
the
da,
although
after
they
arrested
him...
didn't
they
describe
the
whole
episode
from
when
they
saw
alford
pull
up
behind
the
disabled
vehicle?
they
described
that
and
they
mentioned
the
flashing
lights.
they
described
the
whole
episode
up
till
the
point
where
they...
the
officers
apprehended
him
and
saw
the
equipment
and
then
noticed...
they
told
the
da
everything,
and
he
said,
yes,
you
have
probable
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
couldn't
it
be
related
in
time
and
space
rather
than
legally
related?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you've
already
conceded
that
it...
washington
law
doesn't
require
the
officer
on
the
spot
to
say
why
he's
making
the
arrest
and
that
there's
no
decision
of
this
court
or
any
court
that
i
know
that
said
the
constitution
requires
the
officer
on
the
spot
to
give
a
reason.
