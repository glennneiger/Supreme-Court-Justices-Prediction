mr.
james
b.
comey
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
validity
of
a
police
action
under
the
fourth
amendment
turns
upon
an
objective
assessment
of
the
facts
viewed
through
the
prism--
mr.
james
b.
comey
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
comey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
comey
i
suspect,
your
honor,
that
the
government
would
urge
such
a
rule
if
it
were
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
james
b.
comey
well,
i
don't
see
it
at...
at
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
comey
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the
government's
position,
as
with
the
state
of
washington's
position,
is
that
the...
the
analysis
is
simply
did
the
facts
known
to
the
officer,
viewed
through
the
prism
of
an
objectively
reasonable
officer,
establish
probable
cause.
and
that
to
make
an
evaluation
of
the
arrest
turn
upon
the
officer's
subjective
assessment
of
those
facts...
in
other
words,
the
working
of
his
brain,
the
crunching
of
those
facts
that
results
in
the
spitting
out
of
a
legal
conclusion...
is
contrary
to
this
court's
precedent
and
guts
the
objective
reasonable
test,
and
would
make,
instead,
the
validity
of
a
fourth
amendment
action
turn
upon
whether
the
officer
is
particularly
smart,
whether
he's
new,
whether
he's
nervous,
whether
he
says
nothing
at
all
or
whether
he
decides
to
say,
you're
under
arrest
for
everything
listed
in
the
washington
code
book.
under
those
circumstances,
the
results
would
be
different.
the...
the
concern
that
your
honor
raised
about
police
officers
engaging
in
a
post
hoc
rationalization
i
respectfully
suggest
is
not
a
concern
that
is
rooted
in
reality
because
the
facts
continue
to
drive
the
analysis.
whether
or
not
a
police
officer
is
right
at
the
arrest
scene
in
invoking
a
particular
statute,
if
that
turns
out
to
be
incorrect,
it
is
still
the
facts
that
were
known
to
him
that
must
support
probable
cause
for
some
other
offense.
mr.
james
b.
comey
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
i
also
suggest
that
if
this
were
the
concern
that
the
ninth
circuit
were
looking
to
address
by
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine,
the
remedy
sweeps
far
too
broadly
in
both
directions.
it
punishes
officers
who
at
the
scene
engage
in
remarkable
good
faith
conduct.
i
mean,
these
two
police
officers
i
think
are
what
the
public
would
hope
these
police
officers
were,
looking
at
a
code
book
at
the
roadside,
calling
a
prosecutor
late
at
night,
trying
to
get
it
right.
they
are
punished
under
this
doctrine.
those
that
are
rewarded
are
those
who
are
smart
enough,
perhaps
a
veteran,
perhaps
someone
who
has
read
the
ninth
circuit's
cases,
to
stay
completely
silent,
to
say
nothing
at
all,
knowing
that
he's
going
to
be
fine.
he
needs
to
engage
in
no--
mr.
james
b.
comey
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
comey
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
what
whren
teaches
is
that
the
subjective
working
of
the
police
officer's
mind,
his
motives,
his
intentions,
his
legal
assessments,
as
in
other
cases,
his
legal
assessment
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
a
consent
to
search,
or
the
reason
he's
boarding
a
boat,
is
irrelevant,
that
that's
for
courts
to
do.
what
matters
is
what
came
into
an
officer's
brain,
not
what
came
out
as
a
result
of
his
working
on
it.
because,
as
i
said,
that
would
make
law
enforcement
far
from
evenhanded.
it
would
make
it
depend
upon
who
the
officer
was
at
the
roadside
on
any
given
night.
and
those
similarly
situated
would
be
treated
very,
very
differently,
depending
upon
what
an
officer
chose
to
say.
and
as
i
said,
silence
in
a...
in
a
jurisdiction
that's
governed
by
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine
is
the
best
course.
mr.
james
b.
comey
i
think
we
would
still
be
discussing
whether
the
subjective
functioning
of
an
officer's
mind
is
relevant
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
which
turns
upon
whether
the
action
was
reasonable
in
the
case
of
an
arrest--
mr.
james
b.
comey
--i
think
we
would,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
whren
is
about
motives
and
this
case
is
about
something
very
closely
related,
still
the
inner
working
of
an
officer's
mind,
what
legal
conclusion
he
draws
from
facts.
mr.
james
b.
comey
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
his
speaking,
his
invocation
of
a
particular
code
section
is
an
objective
manifestation
of
an
essentially
subjective
process.
and
that's
illustrated
by
imagining
three
stops
on
that
road
that
night,
three
mr.
alfords,
exact
same
facts.
in
one,
the
officer
is
engaged
in
the
process
that
he
engaged
in
here.
in
the
other
two,
the
officer
chooses
in
the
first
to
say
nothing,
and
in
the
third,
to
say...
hold
up
the
code
book
and
say
what
you
did
is
in
here.
everything
in
here
applies
to
you,
wise
guy.
now
get
in
the
car.
in
those
two
other
circumstances,
complete
silence
and
the
table
of
contents
approach,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
these
officers
would
not
have
been
in
litigation
for
4
years.
that
to
me
demonstrates
that
it
is
essentially
subjective
because
it
is
driven
not
by
the
facts,
what
the
defendant
did,
but
by
the
nature
of
the
police
officer.
is
he
clever?
has
he
gone
to
law
school
at
night?
mr.
james
b.
comey
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
if...
perhaps
my
distinction
is...
is
too
homely,
but
i
would
say
that's
about
what
comes
into
his
mind,
into
the
brain,
his
senses.
did
he
see
this
taillight?
did
he
see
the
sticker?
not
what
comes
out
of
his
mouth
as
a
result
of
the
functioning
of
that
brain,
his
legal
brain.
the
legal
work
is
for
the
courts
looking
at
an
arrest
that's
been
challenged
through
the
prism
of
an
objectively
reasonable
officer.
it
does
not
depend,
else
fourth
amendment
seizures
would
be
not
reasonable,
but
would
vary
depending
upon
the
skills
of
an
individual
officer
from
roadside
to
roadside.
and
that
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
precedent
and
would,
in
fact,
gut
the
objective
reasonableness
test.
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
lead
to
dramatically
uneven
law
enforcement.
it
would,
indeed,
lead
to
either
stacking
or
silence,
and
there's
plenty
of
good
reason
why
an
officer
or
a
federal
agent,
who
are
not
required
to
say
anything
at
arrest,
might
want
to
inform
a
defendant
of
a
basis
for
his
arrest
and
might
want
to
uphold
other
bases
for
an
arrest,
to
protect
a
witness,
for
example.
to
drive
police
officers
to
the
extremes
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
james
b.
comey
yes,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
james
b.
comey
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
seventh
circuit
as
well
and
the
first
circuit.
mr.
james
b.
comey
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i...
i
know
with
federal
agents,
federal
agents
say
nothing.
they're
required
to
say
nothing.
they
simply
bring
a
defendant
in
on
a
warrantless
arrest,
cuff
him,
leave
him
in
the
cellblock,
and
then
the
assistant
u.s.
attorneys
take
the
matter
before
a
magistrate.
so
there
is...
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
demonstrates
the
unworkability
of
this
test
because
there
are
plenty
of
jurisdictions,
thousands
of
federal
agents,
who
are
under
no
obligation
to
say
anything.
and
so
it's
hard
to
see
how
this
test,
even
to
the
extent
there
were
a
concern
about
the
evil
or
perceived
evil
of
post
hoc
rationalization,
which
i
suggest
there
isn't,
this...
how
this
test
would
be
applied--
mr.
james
b.
comey
--yes,
your
honor.
his
perceptions,
the...
the
facts
known
to
the
arresting
officers.
mr.
james
b.
comey
well,
i...
i
would
suspect
that
any
statements
made
or
seizures
made
pursuant
to
the
arrest,
which
was
made
on
facts
known
to
the
officers,
that
did
not
include
what
was
in
his
wallet
would
be
in
jeopardy.
that...
you
still
might
be
able
to
prosecute
him,
but
you'd
have
to
work
awful
hard
to
save
anything
you
got
as
a
result
of
that
arrest.
mr.
james
b.
comey
facts
known
to
the
officers,
including
facts
known
to
officers
with
whom
he
or
she
is
working.
thank
you,
your
honor.
