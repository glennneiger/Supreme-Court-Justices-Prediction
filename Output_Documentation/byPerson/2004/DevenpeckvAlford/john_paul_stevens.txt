justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
no.
03-710,
devenpeck
against
alford.
ms.
hart.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
he
could
be
held
until
a
charge
is
filed
without
being
told
why
he's
being
held?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
could
be
a
week
or
2.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
soon
is
he
entitled
to
appear
before
the
magistrate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
soon
after
his
physical
arrest
does
he
have
a
right
to
appear
before
the
magistrate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
for
72
hours,
he
could
be
held
incommunicado
without
knowing
why
he
was
arrested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
comey.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
even
in
those
examples,
there
could
be
a
difference
in
what
the
police
officer
had
actually
observed.
he
might
not
have
seen
the
safety
sticker
or
the
taillight
or
whatever
it
is.
so
you
do
have
some
inquiry
into
the
mental
processes
of
the
officer
in
every
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
comey.
mr.
phillips.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
did
you
object
to
the
instructions
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
problems
i
have
with
the
case,
very
frankly,
is
that
the
jury
has
already
ruled
against
your
client
on
the
qualified
immunity
issue
carrying
out
instructions
given
by
the
judge
that
were
not
objected
to
by
your
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
whose
fault
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
defendants
claiming,
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
should
be
entitled
to
qualified--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
that
was
overruled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
there
was
a
jury
trial
and
the
jury
disagreed
with
it
and,
in
effect,
said
there...
there
was
basis
for
qualified
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
reason
for
the
jury's
verdict
on
this
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
then
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in...
in
your
view
is
the
closely
related
doctrine
a...
a
matter
of
closely
related
as
a
matter
of
law
between
two
different
offenses
or
is
it
a
matter
of...
are
the
facts
relevant?
for
example,
could
one
argue
that
these
offenses
were
factually
related
pretty
closely
because
they
grew
out
of
the
same
central
group
of
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
phillips,
let
me
go
back
first
principles.
you
are
complaining
about
an
arrest
which
you
admit
was
valid.
do
you
not...
do...
do
you
not
that
the
arrest
was
supported
by
probable
cause
and
therefore
was
a
valid
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
we
were
just
talking
about
qualified
immunity.
but
you
challenge
the
arrest
itself
even
though
you
admit
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
there's
no
need
for
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
unless
there
was
probable
cause
because
if
there
was
no
probable
cause,
you
win
on
that
ground.
you
don't
have
to
get
into
this
closely
related
offense
doctrine.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
if
there
was
no
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
win
without
this
fancy
doctrine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this...
this
doctrine
only
comes
into
play
and
is
only
required
in
cases
involving
a
valid
arrest
and
a...
a
mistake
by
the
officer
in
identifying
the
wrong
cause
for
the
arrest.
so
it's
an
extension
of
the
qualified...
it's
a...
it's
a...
an
application
of
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
to
say
you
are
not
protected
even
though
you
acted
lawfully.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
you
say
the
arrest
was
valid,
he
did
act
lawfully
although
we
didn't
realize
the
reason
why
he
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
hart,
you
have
5...
5
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
hart.
the
case
is
submitted.
