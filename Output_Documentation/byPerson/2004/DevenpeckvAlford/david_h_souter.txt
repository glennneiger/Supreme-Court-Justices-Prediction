justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
an
agency
policy
that
the
state
endorses,
and
if
so,
why...
why
do
you
endorse
or
adopt
the
policy?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that...
i
mean,
is
that
the...
the
real
basis
for
the
policy,
that
we...
that
washington
does
not
want
to
make
it
difficult
for...
for
arrestees
to
raise
bail?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
make
of
the
argument
that
unless
the
cause
of
the
arrest
is,
number
one,
stated
and,
number
two,
a...
a
cause
that
a
defendant
can
rely
on,
that
in
any
case
like
this
in
which
the
stated
grounds
of
the
arrest
turn
out
to
be...
we
will
assume,
turn
out
to
be
inadequate,
the
police
will
always,
particularly
in
traffic
cases,
be
able
to
come
up
with
something
later
on
to
justify
the
arrest?
what...
what
do
you
make
of
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
was
for
an...
an
arrest
in
which,
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
the...
the
stated
grounds
for
the
arrest
were
those
for
which
there
was
probable
cause.
and
i
think
one
of
the
concerns
underlying
the
argument
that
i
asked
you
to
comment
on
is
that
if
the...
if
the
police,
in
effect,
have...
have
discretion
ad
lib
afterwards
to
come
up
with
new
grounds
for
the
arrest,
there's...
there's
going
to
be
a
kind
of
a
basic
corrosion
in
the
integrity
of
the
arrest
process
and
in
the
confidence
of
people
to
believe
that
the
police
are
really
acting
in
good
faith
when
they
make
an
arrest.
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that
may
be...
that
may
be
the...
the
best
response.
and
i
take
it,
so
far
as
you
know,
there...
there
are
no
studies
that
have
gone
into
this
on
an
empirical
basis.
is
that
correct,
so
far
as
you
know?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
the...
the
argument
is
that
he
thinks
he
does
have
a
ground.
it
turns
out
that
he's
wrong.
unless
he
is
very
unimaginative,
he'll
find
another
one.
it's
not
that
he
arrests
saying
i
have
no
basis
to
arrest
this
person,
but
i'll
think
of
something
later.
it's...
it's
the...
the
problem
is,
i
think...
or
the
argument,
i
think,
is
directed
to
a
case
like
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
the
facts,
on
your
view,
have
to
be
known
to
the
officer?
justice
david
h.
souter
is...
is
there...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
in...
in
cases
in
which
we're
inquiring
into
probable
cause
for
a
warrantless
search,
we
give
the
government
credit
for
any
fact
known
to
any
officer,
don't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
we
have
the
same
rule?
why
shouldn't
we
have
the
same
rule
with
respect
to
facts
known
to
any
officer
when
one
officer
makes
an
arrest?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
urging
it
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
just
want
to
know
where
we're
going.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
far
as
you
know,
there...
there
are
no
empirical
studies
looking
into
this
particular
horrible?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if...
if
we
had
gone
the
other
way
in
whren,
we
would
still
have
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case,
wouldn't
we?
regardless
of...
of
how
an
arrest
would
be
justified,
the
issue
here
is
are
the
grounds
of
justification
limited
to
the
reason
and
in
most
cases
the
stated
reason
for
the
arrest.
so
we'd
have
this
problem
even
if
whren
had...
had
come
out
otherwise,
wouldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
question
here
is
the
scope
of
the
fourth
amendment
inquiry.
can
it
take
in
probable
cause
for
reasons
other
than
the
reason
for
the
arrest
or
the
stated
reason
for
the
arrest?
can
it
consider
other
offenses,
and
we'd
have
that
regardless
of...
of
whren,
wouldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
if
it...
whether
it
comports
with
the
common
law,
i
don't
see
why
the
rule
that
you
are
urging,
closely
related,
is
going
to
make
a
dime's
worth
of
difference
unless
ultimately
we
hold
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
state
the
cause
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
booking
occurs
after
arrest,
and
i
thought
what
we
were
concerned
with
in
this
case
was
the
validity
of
the
arrest,
not
the
booking.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
if...
if
the...
if
the...
if
it
is
the
validity
of
arrest,
which...
which
is
in
issue,
i
don't
see
why
your
rule
is
going
to
make
any
difference
in
the
long
run
unless
we
go
the
further
step
and
say,
in
order
to
make
this
work,
i.e.,
enforce
fourth
amendment
values,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
the
cause
has
got
to
be
stated.
am...
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
based
on
an
objective
test,
we'll
get
absolutely
nowhere.
the
person
who
is
arrested
is
not
in
a
position
to
be
making
objective
or
subjective
assessments,
by
and
large.
he
probably
knows
what
he's
being
arrested
for
because
it's
obvious,
but
then
we
have
cases
like
this,
which
are
the
only
ones
that
are
going
to
be
litigated,
and
he
may
not
know.
the...
the
fact
still,
it
seems
to
me,
is
obvious.
if
we
go
your
way,
we're
going
to
have
to
go
the
further
step
of
requiring
the
cause
to
be
stated.
isn't
that,
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
i'll
be
candid
with
you.
i
think
it
is
necessary.
but
the...
i
guess
the...
what
i'm
getting
at
in
all
of
this
is
you're
asking
us
to
take
steps
to
solve
a
problem,
and
i
don't
think
you've
demonstrated
what
the
problem
is.
we
keep
coming
back,
as
we
have
several
times,
to
the
lack
of
empirical
studies.
have
we
got
something
to
worry
about
in...
in
enforcing
fourth
amendment
values
that
we
can
only
guard
against
if
we
go
your
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
is
the...
yes,
but
what's
the
justification
for
doing
it?
what
is
the
practical
problem
that
we
are
concerned
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
don't
you
reconcile
the...
the
problem
of
the
straddle
by
saying
that
unless
the
probable
cause,
which
we
will
assume
existed,
is
for
a
closely
related
offense,
the
whole
arrest
was
invalid?
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
let
me
ask
you...
you
one
other
question.
you...
you
started
out
in
getting
down
to
first
principles
with
disfavor
of
warrantless
arrests.
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
officer
had
somehow
gotten
an
arrest
warrant
on
the
spot
for
illegal
taping?
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
has
nothing
to
do,
essentially,
with
warrantless
or
nonwarrantless
arrests.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
this...
yes,
but
on
your
theory,
that
is...
that
is
incidental.
that
is
not
essential.
if
he
had
had
an
arrest
warrant
for
illegal
taping,
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
