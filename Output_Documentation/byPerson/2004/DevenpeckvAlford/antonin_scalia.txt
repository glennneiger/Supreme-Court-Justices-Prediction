not...
not
stacking
charges
you
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hart,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by...
that
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
for
arrest.
do
you
mean
objectively,
or
do
you
mean
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
known
to
the
arresting
officer?
i
mean,
let's...
let's
assume
an
officer
stops
a
car
for
a
broken
taillight,
and
it
turns
out
the
car
doesn't
have
a
broken
taillight.
all
right?
so
that
basis
is
wrong.
however,
the
car
also
has
an
expired
inspection
sticker,
which
the
officer
didn't
know
about.
was
there
a
probable
cause
for
arrest,
as
you're
using
the
term
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
knew
those
facts
and
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
it
has
to
be
known.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
my
example,
the
arrest
would
be
invalid
because
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
he
didn't
know
about
the
sticker.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
it's
the
facts
known
to
the
officer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
have
to
establish
the
probable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--once...
once
you
establish
that
limitation,
are
you
willing
to
accept
the
horrible
that...
that
justice
souter
proposed
to
you?
is
it...
is
it,
indeed,
so
easy
to...
to
gin
up
some
other
cause
for
arrest
when
you
used
a
mistaken
cause?
i
don't
know
that
it's
all
that
easy.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
magistrate
keep
those
grounds
secret?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wouldn't
the
magistrate
tell
him
why
he's
being
held?
justice
antonin
scalia
must...
must
be
very
stupid
police
officers.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
just
obvious
what...
what
you
have
to
do
to
make
a
valid
arrest.
if
you
say
nothing,
any...
any
basis
that
you
could
have
had
for
the
arrest
will...
will
be
used.
whereas,
if
you...
if
you
mention
something,
you
better
be
able
to
substantiate
that
particular
cause
or
a
closely
related
crime.
police
officers
aren't
any
dumber
than
the
rest
of
us.
i
can't
believe
that...
that
that
wouldn't
be
the...
the
consequence
of...
of
the
rule
you're
asking
us
to
adopt.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
put
it
this
way,
it
seems
to
me
the
burden
should
be
on
you
to...
to
tell
us
why
a
police...
police
officers
are
so
stupid
that
they...
that
they
go
around
and...
and
continue
to
give
reasons
when
that's...
when
that's
going
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
sustain
the
arrest
and
subject
them
to...
to
personal
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
should
have
been
arrested.
i
mean,
so
long
as
they
should
have
been
arrested,
who
cares?
in
this
case,
i
mean,
it'll...
it'll
be
ultimately
be
tried
by
a
jury
i...
i
guess,
but
your...
your
client
pulls
up
behind
another
car
with
wig-wag
lights
flashing,
like
a
police
car.
right?
he
has
a
police
scanner
on
the
seat
next
to
him.
he
has
handcuffs.
he
has
tinted
glass
in
front
of
the
license
plate...
of
his
license
plate,
so
it
can't
be...
can't
be
read.
it
seems
to
me
there
was
obvious
probable
cause
to...
to
arrest
this
fellow
for
impersonating
a
police
officer.
and
i
would
have
hoped
he
would
have
been
arrested
so
he
wouldn't
go
around
and...
and
pull
up
behind
another
car.
what
is
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
he
should
have
been
arrested,
and
the...
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
police
officer
gave
the
wrong
reason
for
arresting
him
doesn't
make
me
feel
very
bad
about
the
arrest
at
all.
i'm
glad
he
was
arrested.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
that
isn't
the
issue
before
us
here.
i...
i
assume
that
for
purposes
of
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari,
we
have
to
assume,
or
else
the
whole
thing
doesn't
make
any
sense
and
it's
all...
it's
all
arguing
about
nothing...
we
have
to
assume
that
there
was
probable
cause
on
some
other
ground
than
the
ground
which
he
stated
or
anything
closely
related
to
the
ground
which...
which
the
officer
stated.
isn't
that...
isn't
that
the...
the
manner
in
which
this
case
gets
to
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
that's
not
the
ground
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
decided
it.
the
ninth
circuit
never
had
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
on
these
other
grounds--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it
found,
even
if
there
was
these
other
grounds,
they're
not
closely
related
to
the
illegal
taping.
so
i
suppose
you're
telling
us
that
if
we
find
that
we
do
not
like
the
closely
related
rule,
that
it's
not
part
of...
of
united
states
constitutional
law,
what
we
should
do
is
remand
to
the
ninth
circuit
so
that
they
could
determine
whether
there
was
probable
cause
on
the
other
grounds.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
my
reason.
i
don't
even
know
the
man.
i'm
just--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
that
challenge
that
here,
though.
i
asked
you
that
question
earlier,
and
i
thought
you
agreed
that
for
purposes
of
our
deciding
this
case,
we...
we
will
assume,
though
you
do
not
concede
the
point,
that
there
was
probable
cause
on
one
of
the
other
grounds.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
exactly.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
case
no.
03-710,
devenpeck
versus
alford.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
officer
joi
haner,
a
member
of
the
washington
state
patrol
and
one
of
the
petitioners
here,
stopped
a
car
driven
by
respondent
jerome
alford
on
the
basis
of
haner’s
suspicion
that
earlier
along
the
highway,
alford
had
been
impersonating
a
police
officer
when
assisting
some
stranded
motorists.
haner’s
questioning
of
alford
during
the
stop
bolstered
this
suspicion.
alford
was
listening
to
the
radio
frequency
of
the
police
department
of
a
neighboring
county.
he
had
handcuffs
and
a
hand-held
police
scanner
in
his
car.
he
claimed
to
have
worked
in
law
enforcement
first
in
washington
and
then
in
texas
but
later
changed
that
story,
and
he
claimed
not
to
know
how
to
turn
on
the
wig-wag
headlights
that
the
stranded
motorists
had
told
haner
he
used
when
he
came
to
their
assistance,
saw
their
headlights
that
flashed
alternately
one
side
and
the
other.
these
lights
were,
alford
told
haner,
part
of
a
recently
installed
car
alarm
system.
when
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case
sergeant
gerald
devenpeck
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
stop,
alford
told
him
as
well
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
activate
the
wig-wag
headlights.
both
officers
were
skeptical
and
rightly
so
since
it
turned
out
that
the
light
were
activated
by
a
button
close
to
the
driver’s
knee
which
alford
carefully
avoided
pressing.
but
before
devenpeck
finished
questioning
alford
he
saw
that
alford
was
tape
recording
their
conversation
believing
this
to
be
illegal,
he
told
alford
that
he
was
under
arrest
for
violating
the
state
privacy
act.
alford
protested
that
there
was
a
state
court
of
appeals
decision
that
allowed
him
to
tape
conversations
with
the
police
officers
but
the
officers
were
not
impressed.
haner
took
alford
into
custody
and
cited
the
privacy
act
defense
at
booking.
as
it
turned
out,
alford
was
right,
the
washington
court
of
appeals
had
held
five
years
earlier
that
because
road
side
conversation
with
police
officers
are
not
private
within
the
meaning
of
the
state
privacy
act.
it
was
not
illegal
to
record
them
without
the
officer’s
consent
and
the
district
court
dismissed
the
charge.
alford
sued
both
devenpeck
and
haner
in
federal
court
under
state
law
and
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983
alleging
that
the
officers
violated
his
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
by
arresting
him
without
probable
cause.
the
district
court
denied
the
officers’
motion
for
qualified
immunity
and
the
case
went
to
trial.
the
jury
returned
a
unanimous
verdict
in
favor
of
the
officers.
the
ninth
circuit
however
ordered
a
new
trial.
as
relevant
to
our
decision
today,
it
held
that
alford’s
arrest
was
necessarily
unconstitutional
because
tape
recording
officers
is
not
a
crime
in
washington.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
officer’s
argument
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
alford
for
either
impersonating
or
obstructing
a
police
officer.
those
offenses,
it
said,
were
neither
based
on
the
same
facts
as
nor
closely
related
to
the
offense
invoked
by
devenpeck
when
he
arrested
alford,
and
they
were
there
for
irrelevant
to
the
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
inquiry.
finding
no
basis
in
our
precedent
or
in
reason
for
this
limitation
on
the
probable
cause
inquiry
we
reversed
the
ninth
circuit.
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
when
the
facts
known
to
the
arresting
officer
would
cause
a
reasonable
officer
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
except
for
asking
what
facts
the
arresting
officer
knew,
this
inquiry
is
an
objective
one,
the
arresting
officer
subjective
reason
for
making
the
arrest
need
not
be
the
criminal
offense
as
to
which
the
known
facts
provide
probable
cause.
a
fortiori
there
need
not
be
any
relationship
much
less
a
close
one
between
the
offense
articulated
by
the
arresting
officer
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
the
offense
for
which
there
is
probable
cause.
whereat
otherwise
a
knowledgeable
veteran
officer
could
by
reciting
a
litany
of
possible
offenses
validate
an
arrest
that
a
rookie
officer
possess
to
precisely
the
same
facts
would
be
unable
to
perfect.
we
see
no
reason
to
ascribe
to
the
fourth
amendment's
such
arbitrarily
variable
protections.
as
we
said
in
an
earlier
case
called
whren
versus
united
states,
“the
fourth
amendment’s
concern
with
reasonableness
allows
certain
actions
to
be
taken
in
certain
circumstances
whatever
the
subjective
intent.”
the
closely
related
offense
rule
is
also
condemned
by
its
perverse
consequences
while
it
is
assuredly
good
police
practice
to
inform
a
person
of
the
reason
for
his
arrest
at
the
time
he
is
taken
into
custody,
we
have
never
held
that
to
be
constitutionally
required.
thus,
the
probable
consequence
of
the
closely
related
offense
rule
is
not
that
officers
will
seek
making
so-called
“sham
arrests’
but
rather
that
they
will
seized
providing
reasons
for
arrest
all
together
and
even
if
officers
were
required
to
provide
a
reason
for
arrest,
they
would
simply
give
every
reason
for
which
probable
cause
could
conceivably
exist.
for
these
reasons
and
others
expressed
in
our
opinion
today
we
reject
the
closely
related
offense
rule.
we
remand
this
case
to
the
ninth
circuit
so
that
it
may
conduct
the
inquiry
that
the
closely-related
offense
rule
enabled
it
to
avoid
namely
whether
the
facts
known
to
the
officers
here
provided
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
either
obstructing
or
impersonating
a
police
officer.
the
decision
is
unanimous
except
that
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
decision.
i
also
have
an
opinion
to
announce
on
behalf
of
the
chief
justice
in
case
no.
03-407,
kowalski
versus
tesmer.
that
case
came
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
michigan
provides
that
an
appeal
by
an
accused
who
has
pled
guilty
is
by
leave
of
court
not
a
matter
of
right.
michigan
state
judges
must
deny
appointed
appellate
counsel
to
indigents
who
plead
guilty
and
do
not
meet
certain
criteria.
two
attorneys
and
three
indigents
challenged
michigan’s
procedure
for
appointing
appellate
counsel
in
federal
district
court.
they
alleged
that
the
procedure
violated
the
equal
potection
and
due
process
rights
of
the
indigents.
the
district
court
agreed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
heard
the
case
en
banc
and
affirmed
in
relevant
part.
it
held
the
two
attorneys
had
standing
to
bring
the
suit
although
the
three
indigent
defendants
had
to
be
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
the
so-called
younger
doctrine
which
prevents
federal
court
interference
with
ongoing
state
criminal
proceedings.
we
granted
certiorari.
today
in
an
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
we
hold
that
the
two
attorney
respondents
lack
third
party
standing
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
indigents.
accordingly,
we
reverse
without
reaching
the
constitutionality
of
the
michigan
procedure.
a
party
generally
must
assert
his
own
rights
and
not
those
of
another.
under
the
doctrine
of
third
party
standing
however,
we
have
made
an
exception
to
this
general
rule.
to
determine
whether
third
party
standing
is
appropriate
we
have
focused
on
two
questions:
we
have
asked
first
whether
the
person
asserting
the
right
has
a
close
relationship
with
the
person
possessing
the
right;
and
second,
whether
there
is
a
hindrance
to
the
possessor’s
ability
to
protect
his
own
right.
here,
the
attorneys
attempt
to
assert
the
rights
of
hypothetical
indigent
offenders
who
will
request
in
the
future
but
be
denied
appellate
counsel
under
michigan’s
procedure.
we
do
not
believe
these
attorneys
have
a
close
relationship
with
these
hypothetical
indigents.
indeed,
they
do
not
have
relationship
at
all.
we
also
do
not
believe
there
is
the
necessary
hindrance
to
the
indigents
asserting
their
own
equal
protection
and
due
process
rights
to
challenge
the
procedure.
the
indigents
have
open
avenues
in
state
and
federal
court
to
assert
their
rights
against
the
michigan
procedure,
and
in
fact
some
indigents
without
the
aid
of
an
attorney
have
advanced
their
claims
to
the
michigan
appellate
courts
and
to
this
court.
this
disproves
the
attorney’s
theory
that
without
the
assistance
of
an
attorney
the
indigents
are
unable
to
assert
their
own
rights.
on
a
more
fundamental
level,
if
the
indigents
were
hindered
by
the
lack
of
an
attorney,
that
hindrance
could
have
been
solved
by
the
attorneys
before
us
here
attending
state
court
and
assisting
them
without
charge.
finally,
the
indigents
themselves
appropriately
were
dismissed
as
i
said
earlier
under
the
younger
doctrine
preventing
federal
court
interference
with
ongoing
state
criminal
proceedings
and
unwillingness
to
allow
our
younger
principle
to
be
the
circumvented
is
an
additional
reason
to
deny
the
attorney’s
third
party
standing.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
souter
have
joined.
