mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
essence,
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine
enforces
the
reasonableness
clause
by
precluding
officers
from
arresting
someone
for
non-criminal
conduct.
at
its
core,
that's
what
this
is
about.
mr.
alford
was
arrested
for
conduct
that
was
not--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--well,
your
honor,
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine
itself
is...
it's
in
five
circuits...
six
depending
on
how
you
count
the
cases.
but
it's
designed
to...
to
look
at
two
things:
number
one,
whether
the
arrest
itself
is
reasonable;
and
number
two,
from
a
qualified
immunity
standpoint,
whether...
essentially
it's
a
no
harm/no
foul
rule.
if
the
conduct
for
which
the
person
was
arrested
is
criminal,
but
the
officer
merely
has
a
mistake
in
terminology...
he
calls
it
driving
while
license
suspended
instead
of
reckless
driving...
then
it
actually
salvages
the
arrest
for
law
enforcement.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
your
honor,
that...
that
implicates
several
other
rights.
number
one,
it
is...
while
an
officer
could,
in
some
jurisdictions,
effectuate
a
warrantless
arrest
without
stating
a
basis
therefor--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--i
hate
to
say
this,
your
honor,
but
it
depends
because
at
some
point,
for
example,
when
the
person
is
brought
before
the
magistrate
for
the
probable
cause
determination,
they're
not
operating
in
a
vacuum.
there
will
have
to
be--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--your
honor,
the...
in
this
case,
of
course,
that's...
that's
not
the...
that's
not
this
case
because
the
officer
was
very
clear.
he
said
exactly
what
it
was
for,
and
then
he...
when
he
booked
him,
officer
haner
even
booked
him
for
illegal
recording.
so
in
this
case,
we're...
we're
not
presented
with
a
vacuum.
but
even
in
an
instance
where
the
officer
did
not
state
at
the
instant
of
the
arrest
why
he
was
arresting
the
person,
one
of
the
benefits
of
this
doctrine
is
that
it
would
allow
for
an
objective
review
of
the
facts
in
order
to
determine--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--your
honor,
the...
the
danger
of
that
is
that
allowing
this,
as...
as
i
termed
it,
a
general
right
of
arrest
with...
with
no
articulated
basis
at
any
point
up
until
charging
runs
contrary
to
some
of
the
basic
principles--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--i'll
be
very
happy
if
you--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--well,
your
honor,
to
sort
of
piggyback
on
what
justice
souter
and
what
justice
ginsburg
had
commented
on,
there's
no
empirical
evidence
to
suggest
that
there
is
or
would
be
a
movement
by
police
officers
towards
silence.
there
is
simply
nothing
out
there
that
says
that
police
officers
have
in
the
past
in
the
six
jurisdictions,
the
six
circuits
that
use
this.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
have
remained
silent
in
an
effort
to--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--your
honor--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--well,
for
the
most
part,
justice
scalia,
it
does
not
come
back
to
haunt
the
officers
because
the
vast
majority
of
arrests
are
lawful.
the
vast
majority
of
officers
have
probable
cause
for
the
thing
that
they
arrest
the
person
for,
and
they
arrest
him
for
criminal
conduct.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
the
issue
of...
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
has
never
been
ruled
on
by
this
court.
there
are--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--personally,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would...
that
would
certainly
comport
more
with
the
common
law
that
was
extant
at
the
time
the
constitution
was--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--because,
your
honor,
even
if
the...
even
if
the
cause
of
the
arrest
is
not
stated
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
the
person
must
be
booked
for
something.
there's
a...
a
report
that's
generated.
in
this
instance--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
well,
your
honor,
i
would
analogize
it
to
the...
the
arrest
rule.
whether
someone
is
or
is
not
under
arrest
from
a
fourth
amendment
standpoint
is
based
on
an
objective
test,
and
it
is
viewed
after
the
fact.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
it
would
certainly
make
it
easier,
but
it's
not
necessary.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
there
are
six
circuits
that
have
adopted
this
policy
shows
that
this
is...
that
this
is
a
problem
that
occurs
nationwide.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
the
practical
problem
is
that
people
are
being
arrested
for
conduct
that
is,
at
its
base,
not
criminal.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
well,
your
honor--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--i'm
going
to
disagree
on
two
points.
first,
at
the
trial
court,
the
state
did
not
argue
that
he
could
have
been
arrested
for
other
crimes.
the
jury
was
never
instructed
on
the
elements
of
these
supposed
other
crimes.
and
we
pointed
that
out
in
the
appeal
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
no,
your
honor,
because
the--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
only
instructions
that
were
given
regarding...
regarding
what
they
needed
to
find
to
find
a
violation
were
the
privacy
act
instructions.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
state
wanted
them
to...
qualified
immunity
is
an
affirmative
defense.
if
they
wanted
the
state
to
find...
if
they
wanted
the
jury
to
find
there
was
impersonation,
they
should
have
requested
an
instruction
on
that
because
impersonation
in
washington
requires
more
than
simply
taking
an
action
that
creates
an
impression
that
you're
an
officer.
it
also...
under
first
degree,
there
has
to
be
specific
intent
to
defraud
someone,
and
here
the
only
thing
he
did,
he
gave
them
a
flashlight
and
helped
them
jack
up
their
car.
on
the
issue
of
the
wig-wag
headlights,
the
transcript
shows
that
the
officer
spent
a
minute
or
2,
by
his
own
estimation,
on
the
scene
behind
mr.
alford's
car,
saw
no
wig-wag
headlights.
and
as
for
the
scanner,
the...
the
transcript,
page
246...
he
admitted
at
trial
it
was
actually
a
ham
radio,
not
a
portable
police
scanner.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
and
that...
that...
we
have
not
argued
that
there
was
not
suspicion
sufficient
to...
to
have
a
stop
to
do
investigation.
however,
under
the
washington
statute,
there
was
not
evidence
sufficient
to
show
probable
cause
that
there
was
an
actual
crime--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--no,
your
honor.
it
is
a
traffic
violation.
that
is
a
non-arrestable
offense,
and
that
was
admitted
at
court
and
also
here
today.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
no,
your
honor.
even
the
traffic
infraction
was
dismissed
by
the
judge.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
but
that--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--no,
your
honor.
the
obstruction
charge
also
under
washington
law...
under
the
case
law
interpreting
the
statute,
there
has
to
not
only
be
the...
the
hindrance
or
obstruction.
there
has
to
be
specific
intent,
and
there
has
to
be
obstruction
in
fact.
and
in
this
case,
both
of
the
officers
testified
that
they...
that
he
pushed
every
button
they
asked
him
to.
he
opened
the
hood
for
them.
he
let
them
look
at
the...
the
flasher
unit.
he
showed
them
the
manual.
they
both
say
that
they
saw
this
button
that
after
the
arrest
they
pushed...
one
of
them
pushed.
however,
there's
obviously
no
obstruction
in
fact
if...
one
of
them
actually
said
at
trial
that
he
didn't
ask
him
to
push
the
button
because
he
wanted
to
see
whether
he
would
push
it
or
not.
so
there's
no...
again,
there's
no
facts
to
support
a
finding
of
probable
cause
even
on
the
obstruction
because
the
officers
were
essentially
just
letting
him
hang
himself.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
your
honor,
we
raised
the
issue
at
the
ninth
circuit
that
there
had
been
no
evidence
put
forward
on
the
other
crimes.
and
we
pointed
out
that
even
the
deputy
prosecuting
attorney...
and
in
fact,
even
in
closing
argument,
when
they
addressed
the...
the
wig-wag
headlights,
et
cetera,
they
stated
specifically
that
that
information
went
to
what
they
called
his
intent
to
unlawfully
record.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
in...
in
looking
at
this...
this
probable
cause
determination
and
the
reasonableness
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
qualified
immunity,
of
course,
was
a
doctrine
that
was
advanced
by
the
court
to
address
specific
problems.
none
of
those
problems
are
impacted
in
any
way
by
the
closely
related
offense,
this
subset
of
qualified
immunity
cases.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
that
was
denied,
yes.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
yes.
yes,
justice
stevens.
and
the...
in
reviewing
the
transcript
and
in
reviewing
the...
the
instructions
and
the
ruling
on
the
summary
judgment
motion,
the
reason
that
senior
judge
bryan
did
not
rule
on
the
qualified
immunity
was
twofold.
one,
at
the
time
of
the
summary
judgment
motion,
one
of
the
officers
was...
well,
was
lying
about
having
contacted
the
prosecutor
prior
to
making
the
arrest,
and
he
noted
in
his
order
that
there
was
a
factual
dispute.
so
summary
judgment
wasn't
appropriate.
and
second,
judge
bryan
indicated
that
essentially
there
was
a
problem
created
by
the
saucier
opinion
because
he
felt
that
it
was
somehow
possible
that
there
could
have
been
an
arrest
effectuated
without
probable
cause,
but
that
there
was
a
reasonable
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
officers.
so
this
did
not
proceed
to
the
jury
on
the...
on
this
closely
related
offense
doctrine.
it
didn't
proceed
on
there
were
these
other
crimes
for
which
probable
cause
existed,
but
on
this
broad
standard
of
good
faith
and
reasonable
mistake.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
i
almost
hate
to
say
it,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it
was
a
lack
of
sympathy.
that...
that
is
my...
much
like
with
justice
scalia,
i
believe
they...
they
looked
at
the...
the
circumstances
and
even
though
there
was
not
probable
cause
to
have
arrested
him,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
we
don't
like
mr.
alford.
we're
not
going
to
find
for
him.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
i
often
used
the
phrase
same
conduct
test
because
in
amalgamating
the
six
different
circuits,
that
appeared
to
be
the
most
consistent
test
and
the
one
that's
most
consistent
with
the
objective
standard
and
with
the
reasonableness
standard,
that
if...
and
i,
again,
go
to
the
no
harm/no
foul.
if
you're
engaging
in
conduct
that
would
have
and
should
have
led
to
your
arrest,
if
it's
the
same
conduct
for
which
you
were
arrested
and
it's
simply
misnamed,
then
there
essentially
is
no
harm
of
constitutional
magnitude.
but
otherwise--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--they
did
describe
the
entire
episode
to
him,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
well,
i'm
not
urging
something
as
narrow
as...
as
a
semi-blockburger
test.
but
here
you
have
essentially
two
discrete
conducts
that
were
being
examined
by
the
officers:
number
one,
the
actions
surrounding
the
headlights;
and
number
two,
the
actions
surrounding
the
taping.
and
the
trial...
i
mean,
it
was
very
clear
that
the
two
were
treated
as
discrete
incidents
by
the
police.
at
the
moment
devenpeck
saw
the
tape
recorder...
and
he
testified
at
trial.
when
i
saw
the
recorder
in
the
record
mode
and
saw
that
it
was
moving,
that's
what
he
stated
to
him
constituted
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
the
moment
he
saw
that
tape
recorder
and
saw
the
play
and
record
buttons
were
pushed,
he
informed
mr.
alford,
you're
under
arrest
for
making
an
illegal
tape
recording.
so
when
looking
at
whether
something
is...
is
sufficiently
related
or
not,
obviously
there's
going
to
have
to
be
more
than
a
modicum
of
logic
that's
used,
but
objectively
this
separates
rather
nicely
into
two
discrete
incidents
for
the
analysis.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
concerned
so
much...
this
doctrine
is
not
concerned
so
much
with
what
to
label
the
crime.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
well,
your
honor,
the
distinction
in...
in
this
particular
case
and
the
distinctions
in
the...
in
the
cases
that
run
the
gamut
around
the
circuits
generally
show
one
thing
that
we--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--your
honor,
if
we
start
with
first
principles,
and
the
first
principle
that
underlies
this
case
is
there
is,
from
the
framing
area...
era,
a
general
mistrust
of
warrantless
arrests.
from
that,
we
step
to
the
reasonableness
clause.
from
the
reasonableness
clause,
we
then
step
to
this
judicially
created
qualified
immunity,
which
subsumed
the
good
faith
analysis.
so
what
we
find
is
we're
stepping
further
and
further
away
from
the
original
principle.
and
the...
on
the
original
principles,
he
was
arrested
without
a
warrant.
wrong.
under
the
constitution
we
have
reasonableness.
okay.
he's
arrested.
was
it
a
reasonable
arrest?
the
court
has
said
we
generally
say
that
if
an
arrest
has
probable
cause,
then
it's
reasonable
unless
there
are
these
exigent
circumstances,
excessive
force,
et
cetera.
then
under
qualified
immunity,
it's
even
a
step
more
attenuated,
that
even
though
there
might
not
have
been
probable
cause,
if
there
was
arguable
probable
cause,
then
there
would
be
a
violation,
but
no
one
is
going
to
be
liable
for
it.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
in
this
instance,
your
honor?
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
certainly
not.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
no,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
feel
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
that
in
order
to
address
the
ninth
circuit's
holding--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--if
there
was
probable
cause--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--oh,
correct.
if
there
was
no
probable
cause
for--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--that's...
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
was--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--well,
because
it
actually...
to
turn
it
back
around,
you're
not
protected
because
you
did
not
act
lawfully.
you
did
not
act
lawfully
because--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--your
honor,
the
cases
that
have
examined
this
doctrine
have...
have
looked
at
it
as
sort
of
straddling
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
qualified
immunity
analysis.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
correct.
unreasonable.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
certainly,
your
honor,
and
there
we
would--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--well,
in
this
case
it
does,
but
had
there
been
a
warrant--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
and
i
think
that
that...
of
course,
that...
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there's
support
for
that,
that
historically
the
warrant
must
show
the
reason
that
someone
is
being
arrested.
so
as
we
pointed
out,
there's
this...
an
odd--
mr.
r.
stuart
phillips
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
one
of
the
most
fundamental
principles
that
we
can
look
at
on
showing
the
reason
why
you're
being
arrested
is
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus
where,
in
order
to
hold
someone,
they
must
show
why
he
