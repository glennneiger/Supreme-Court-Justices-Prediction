ms.
hart,
is
there
any
requirement
in
washington
or
generally
that
an
officer
state
the
grounds
for
the
arrest
to
the
person
being
arrested
at
the
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we're
dealing
here
with
a
case
from
the
state
of
washington,
and
you
assert
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
washington.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
this
case
when
the
respondent
was
arrested,
he
was
informed
by
the
officer
that
the
arrest
was
for
making
a
tape
recording
of
the
conversation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
turns
out...
do
you
concede
that
that
was,
in
fact,
not
a
lawful
grounds
for
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
in
the
state
of
washington,
that
it
is
perfectly
lawful
to
record
the
conversation
with
the
police?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i'm
asking
you.
what
is
your
view?
is
it
lawful
or
not
for
an
individual
to
record,
tape
record,
the
conversation
with
a
policeman
on
the
occasion
of
a
stop?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
decide
this
case
on
the
understanding
that
it
was
lawful
to
make
the
recording?
is
that
the
basis
in
which
we
decide
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
washington
also
has
an
anti-stacking
policy,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is...
is
that
just
a
rule
of
the
patrolmen
in
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
won't
arrest
someone
for
several
charges?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
comey,
i
think
you
rely,
in
part
at
least,
on
this
court's
case
in
whren--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
the
result
for
which
you
argue.
but
in
whren,
the
stated
reason
for
the
stop,
traffic
enforcement,
was
lawful,
and
we
didn't
have
to
look
any
further.
in
this
case,
the
stated
reason
i
think
we
assume,
at
least
according
to
the
trial
judge's
instruction
to
the
jury,
was
unlawful.
does
that
impair
the
reliance
on
whren?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
at
its
core
it
was
about
this
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
about
closely
related
offenses.
i
thought
at
its
core
that's
what
we
were
concerned
with.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
arresting
officer
just
doesn't
give
a
reason
for
the
arrest,
just
makes
the
arrest,
and
it
turns
out,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
that
indeed
there
were
objective
facts
that
would
have
justified
an
arrest.
it
wasn't
what
the
officer
had
in
mind
but
he
didn't
say
anything.
what
result
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could...
could
an
arrest
made
under
the
circumstances
i
described
be
valid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
at
that
time,
there
does.
but
we're
talking
about
at
the
time
of
arrest.
and
it...
it
just...
if
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine
has
the
effect
of
punishing
an
officer
for
explaining
to
the
suspect
a
reason
for
the
arrest,
why
is
that
a
good
doctrine?
i
mean,
if
the
officer
could
say
nothing
and
could
end
up,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
having
a
valid
arrest,
i
just
think
the
closely
related
doctrine
doesn't
serve
a
very
good
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
objective
review
shows
that
there
were,
indeed,
facts
that
would
have
justified
an
arrest,
then
what's
wrong
with
allowing
that
to
proceed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
your
client
ever
found
guilty
of
any
offense
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
have
any
case
law
to
cite
to
us
for
that.
that
gets
us
into
a
whole
new
doctrine.
