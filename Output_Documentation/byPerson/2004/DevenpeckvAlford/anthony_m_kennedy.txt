well,
for
argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in...
in
the
federal
system,
is
the
arrest
based
on
what
the
officer
knew
and...
and
see...
and
saw
at
the
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
he
had
asked
for
a
gun
permit
and
he
sees
the
gun
permit,
and
he
said,
well,
it's...
that's
okay.
you've
got
the
permit,
but
i'm
going
to
arrest
you
for
reckless
driving.
then
he
finds
out
the
driving
charge
is
no
good.
it
can't
stand.
but
then
they
look
at
his
wallet
more
carefully
and
they
see
the
permit
is
expired.
what...
what
rule
then?
at
the
police
station,
they...
they
see
the
permit
is
expired.
in
other
words,
they
find
out
a
fact
after...
after
they
arrested
him.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
confine
the
rule
to
what
the
officer
has
seen
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
what's...
what's
happening
here
is
in
order
to
avoid
the
down
side
of
your
test...
as
justice
o'connor
puts
it,
her
point
is
that
if
we
adopt
your
rule,
there's
going
to
be
an
incentive
not
to
state
the
reason.
now,
in
order
to
avoid
that...
you
haven't
really
squarely
confronted
it...
i
think
you're
suggesting
that
there
has
to
be
an
additional
rule
that
the
police
officer
must
say
why
he's
arrested,
and...
and
the
authorities
just
don't
establish
that.
now,
if
you
want
us
to
go
on
and
make
up
that
rule,
i
suppose
we
could
make
up
that
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm...
i'm
sure
you'd
be
delighted.
but
that's
not
the
case
we're
confronted
with.
and
if
the
choice
is
between
making
up
a
new
rule
to
make
your
test
work
or
rejecting
your
test,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
the
latter
might
be
the
preferred
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
washington
law,
is
it
lawful
for
your
client
to
have
headlights...
wig-wag
lights?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
unlawful
to
have
wig-wag
lights,
and
i
take
it
it's
an
arrestable
offense
to
impersonate
a
police
officer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
would...
that
would
certainly
be
probable
cause
to
arrest
just
based
on
the
wig-wag,
plus
the
fact
he
lied
to
the
police
in...
in
instructing
them
the
button
to
push
or
didn't
tell
them
what
button
to
push
to
make
them
go.
