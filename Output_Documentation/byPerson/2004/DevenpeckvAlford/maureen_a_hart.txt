ms.
maureen
a.
hart
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
invalidated
mr.
alford's
arrest
and
held
the
arresting
officers
in
this
case
personally
liable
for
damages
based
on
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine.
the
doctrine
is
contrary
to
fundamental
fourth
amendment
principles
that
probable
cause
is
an
objective
inquiry
based
on
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
known
to
the
officer
at
arrest.
in
contrast,
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine
is
a
subject
of
inquiry
that
limits
probable
cause
only
to
those
facts
and
circumstances
closely
related
to
the
offense
that
the
arresting
officer
announces
at
arrest.
under
the
doctrine,
then
if
two
officers
observe
precisely
the
same
facts
and
circumstances
and
arrest
the
suspect,
the
arrest
in
one
case
can
be
valid
and
in
the
other
invalid
based
only
on
the
officer's
subjective
legal
evaluation--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--justice
o'connor,
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
and
there
is
no
requirement
in...
in
washington
that
that
be
done.
a
number
of
states
do
require
that
it
be
done
statutorily
and
many
of
those
states
also--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--there
is
not.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that
is
correct.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that...
at
this
point,
the
question
of
the--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--your
honor--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--this...
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
have
not
been
before
a...
a
court
in
washington,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
your
honor,
i
believe
in
this
case
there
would
be
probable
cause
for
an
officer
to
believe
it
was
and
therefore
effect
an
arrest.
i
don't
believe
that
the...
the
question
has
been
answered
in
washington,
and
i
believe
there
are
good
grounds
to
argue
that
it
would
be
permissible
and
that,
indeed,
unlike
the
decision
in
state
v.
flora,
there
were
distinguishing
circumstances
here,
including
the
absence
of
passers-by
on
the
scene.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
no,
your
honor.
we
have
not
raised
the
privacy
act
as
an
issue
before
this
court.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
the
state
patrol
does,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
it--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--it's
an
agency
policy
and
troopers
with
the
washington
state
patrol
are
trained
to
it.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that...
that
stacking
charges
really
is...
there
are
good
reasons
to
endorse
the
policy.
one
is
that
it's
not
a
particular--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--i'm
sorry.
not
stacking
charges,
your
honor,
is...
is
an...
a
sound
policy
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
it's
not
a
particularly
effective
or
efficient
use
of
law
enforcement
resources,
but
perhaps
more
importantly,
it
can
have
significant
negative
consequences
for
people
who
are
subject
to
arrest
in
terms
of
their
ability...
the
amount
of
bail,
their
ability
to
post
bail,
and
to
secure
a
pre-trial
release.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
your
honor,
i
can't
tell
you
precisely
what
the
washington
state
patrol's
thinking
is
on
it.
my
impression
is
that,
in
part,
they
believe
that...
that
the
appropriate
law
enforcement
response
is...
is
to
determine
whether
there's
probable
cause
and
to
arrest
and
leave
the
sorting
out
of
the
charges
to
be
pressed
actually
by
the
state
to
the
prosecuting
attorney.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
well,
i...
i
think
what
i
would
make
of
it,
justice
souter,
is
that
provided
that
there's
probable
cause
for
arrest,
that
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
basis
to...
to
stop
a
number
of...
of
motorists
is
not...
is
not
relevant.
and
in
part,
i
believe
that,
for
example,
this
court's
decision
in
whren
indicates
that
so
long
as
there
is
probable
cause
for
arrest,
the
reason
for
the--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--well,
your
honor,
the...
if
there
is
probable
cause
for
arrest,
that
is
the
concern
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i...
i
don't
believe
that
the...
the
concern...
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
empirical
evidence
that
the
concern
that
you
are
expressing
has
been
borne
out.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
not
as...
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
but
i
would
also
suggest
to
you
that
the
notion
that
an
officer
would
effect
an
arrest
without
any
basis
for
the
arrest
on
a
hope
that
a
prosecuting
attorney
can
come
up
with
a
basis
for
the
arrest--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--well,
and...
and
your
honor,
i...
i
do
believe
that
the
concern
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which
is
the
only
constitutional
provision
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
that
there
in
fact
be
a
reasonable
basis
for
arrest
and
that
subsequently
or
promptly
subsequently
or
prior
to
arrest
be
tested
by
a
neutral
magistrate.
and
that's
the
only
concern.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
if
there
was
probable
cause
based
on
the...
if
there
was
reason
based
on
the
objective
facts
and
circumstances--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--that...
known
to
the
officer
at
arrest.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
yes.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
absent
the
circumstances
at
arrest
giving
rise
to
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
a
crime
had
been
committed,
there
would
not
be
probable
cause.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
precisely.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
it
is
not
and...
and...
it
is
not.
and
that
was
the...
the
reason
why
i
indicated
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question
that
i
do
believe
that
it
is
not
all
that
easy.
and
i...
i
believe
that
one
of
the
foremost
commentators
in
this
area
has
termed
that
notion
fanciful
for
the
reason
that
it
is...
it
is
stopping
on
a
hope
and
a
prayer
that
something
will
provide
justification
for
that
later--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--yes.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
at
charging,
your
honor,
there...
there...
the...
the
individual
who
has
been
arrested,
as
a
matter
of
the
sixth
amendment,
would
be
entitled
to
know
the
charges
against
him
or
her,
and
the
officer
is
required,
in
a
warrantless
arrest,
to
appear
before
a
neutral
magistrate
and
have
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
tested--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
following
your
question.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
neither,
justice
ginsburg.
the
arrestee
would
be
entitled
constitutionally
to
know
the
charge
against
him
or
her
when
criminal...
a
criminal
prosecution
is
commenced
by
charging.
for
the
most
part,
that
is
done
in
washington
by
an
information
or
a
charge
filed
by
a
prosecuting
attorney.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
justice
stevens--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--but
it
would
be...
he
would
be
held
in
that
case
following
a
determination
by
a
neutral
magistrate
that
there
are
grounds
to
hold
him.
and
at
that
point--
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
--they
would
not
be
secret,
your
honor,
no.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
the
magistrate
would
tell
the...
the
arrestee
why
he's
being
held,
provided
the
arrestee
is
present
for
that
particular
procedure.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i'm
sorry?
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
my...
my
recollection
under
washington's
law
would
be...
72
hours
is
the
time
for
the
charge.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
but...
but
for
that
period,
the
arresting
officer
would
have
had
to...
during
the
48-hour
period
at
the
outset,
that
this
court
discussed
in
riverside,
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
would
be
tested
by
a
neutral
magistrate.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
well,
first
of
all,
again,
justice
ginsburg,
the
privacy
act
issue
is
not
one
that
we
have
raised
before
this
court.
but...
but
the
reason
that
i
would
suggest
it
is
distinguishable
is
that
in
a
subsequent
case
considered
by
the
washington
state
supreme
court
called
state
v.
clark,
the
court
look
at
flora,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
case,
and...
and
termed
it
as
a
case
that
said
you
do
not
have
a
private
conversation
when
it
is
open
to
passers-by.
and
in
flora,
there
was
another
individual
present
at
the
scene
and
who
was,
in
fact,
subsequently
arrested
for
interfering
with
the
arrest
in
the
flora
case.
so
there
is,
all
i'm
suggesting,
at
least
some
grounds
for
distinguishing
the
flora
case
for
that
reason.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
do
believe
there
has,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
matter
of
record,
however,
in
the...
against
arresting
for
that
reason.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
under
washington
law,
the
flashing
headlights,
the
wig-wag
lights,
in
and
of
themselves
would
not
be
an
arrestable
offense.
it
would
be
a
citable
offense.
the
impersonating
offense
involved
in
this
case
would
be
arrestable,
and
the
wig-wag
headlights
would
play
a
part
in
that,
however.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
that's
correct.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
maureen
a.
hart
i
think
i'd
only
like
to
make
one
point,
your
honors,
and
that
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
make
the
validity
of
arrest
a
game
that
the
government
loses
even
when
there's
probable
cause
for
arrest,
but
the
closely
related
offense
doctrine
does.
and
for
that
reason,
it
should
be
rejected
and
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
