justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the
case,
as
far
as
i'm
thinking
of
it
at
the
moment,
comes
down
to
everybody
is
agreeing...
well,
no.
it's...
you
go
ahead
because
you
want
to
reserve
that
probably.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
is
it
exactly
that
a
policeman
who
comes
on
a
difficult
scene,
gun
in
one
pocket,
the
guy
has
a
knife
in
another,
and
he
throws
a
punch?
now,
the
policeman
might
make
a
mistake
about
that.
he...
he
thought
he
threw
a
punch,
but
he
made
a
mistake.
now...
now,
why
is
a
policeman
less
likely
to
make
that
kind
of
a
mistake
than
make
a
mistake
about
what
crime
to
label
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
you
said...
you...
you
say
everybody
agrees
in
this
case
that
if
the
policeman
had
reasonable
cause
objectively
to
arrest
the
person
for
a,
but
he
arrested
him
for
b
instead,
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
that's
okay.
and
on
their
view,
it's...
as
long
as...
it
was
always
okay,
really,
as
long
as
objectively
there
was
reasonable
cause.
on
your
view,
you're
going
to
add
a
little
thing.
you're
going
to
add,
and
by
the
way,
it's
not
okay
unless
that
conduct
that
he
looked
at
was
in
fact
illegal.
so
you
say...
because
policemen
could
make
mistakes
about
labels,
but
they're
not
likely
to
make
mistakes
about
throwing
a
punch.
so
i
just
wondered
why
not.
i
mean,
they
got
the
wrong
guy
for
throwing
the
punch.
you
know,
so...
so
what?
why
is
that
so...
that...
that
supposedly
in
your
view
is
some
terrible
constitutional
harm,
but
if
he
just
mislabels
it,
it's
not
a
terrible
constitutional
harm.
and
i'm
just
puzzled
as
to
where
that
distinction
comes
from
and
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
the
circuits
all
agree
with
you.
now,
my
only
problem
is
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
why
they
all
agree
with
you.
[laughter]
and...
and
that's
where
i'm
sort
of
stuck.
