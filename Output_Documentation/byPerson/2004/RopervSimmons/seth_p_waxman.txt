mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
everyone
agrees
that
there
is
some
age
below
which
juveniles
can't
be
subjected
to
the
death
penalty.
the
question
here
is
where
our
society's
evolving
standards
of
decency
now
draw
that
line.
15
years
ago,
this
court
found
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
a
bright
line
at
18,
but
since
stanford,
a
consensus
has
evolved
and
new
scientific
evidence
has
emerged,
and
these
developments
change
the
constitutional
calculus
for
much
the
same
reasons
the
court
found
compelling
in
atkins.
as
was
noted--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
there
is
a--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
is
a
one-way
ratchet
here
as
there
is
whenever
this
court
draws
a
constitutional
line;
that
is,
whenever
this
court
determines
that
the
constitution
preempts
the
ability
of
legislatures
to
make--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
you
could...
you
could
have,
i
guess,
what
i
refer
to
as
the
dickerson
v.
united
states
phenomenon.
it
could
come
up.
but
what's...
what's
really
interesting...
i
think
what's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it...
it
certainly
would
be
a
permissible...
permissible
argument.
what's...
what's
notable
here,
justice
scalia
and
mr.
chief
justice,
is
how
robust
this
consensus
is.
we're
talking
not
only
about
the
whole
variety
of
ways
in
which
our
society
has
concluded
that
18
is
the
bright
line
between
childhood
and
adulthood
and
that
18
is
the
line
below
which
we
preserve...
presume
immaturity.
but
the
line
with
respect
to
executions,
the
trend
is
very
robust
and
it
is
very
deep.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
are
nine
states
that
allow
adolescents
to
drive
at
the
age
of
16
without
their
parents'
consent.
that...
driving,
of
course,
is
the
classic
example,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to...
to...
there
are
41
states
that
require
parental
consent
below
18.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
they
can
drive
if
their
parents
agree.
my...
my--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--my
point
here
is
that
with
respect
to
the
death
penalty,
we
have
a
substantial
consensus
within
the
united
states,
as
it
happens,
exactly
the
same
lineup
as
existed
in...
as
existed
in...
was
true
in
atkins.
we
have
not
just
a
worldwide
consensus
that
represents
the
better
view
in
europe.
there
are
194
countries--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
was...
i
was
referring
to
the
implication
that
it
has
often
been
said
that
because
the
european
union
thinks
something,
we
should,
therefore,
presume
that
the
world
views
it
that
way.
we're
now
talking
about--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
the
contrary.
my
point
is
we
are
not
talking
about
just
what
a
particular
european
treaty
requires.
we...
the...
the
eight
states
that...
that
theoretically...
that
have
statutes
that
theoretically
permit
execution
of
offenders
under
18
are
not
only
alone
in
this
country,
they
are
alone
in
the
world.
every
country
in
the
world,
including
china
and
nigeria
and
saudi
arabia
and
the...
and
the
democratic
republic
of
the
congo,
every
one
has
agreed
formally
and
legislatively
to
renounce
this
punishment,
and
the
only
country
besides
the
united
states
that
has
not
is
somalia,
which
as
this
court
was
reminded
yesterday,
has
no
organized
government.
it
is
incapable--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--of
course
not,
but
this
is
a...
this
is
a
standard
which...
a
constitutional
test
that
looks
to
evolving
standards
of
moral
decency
that
go
to
human
dignity.
and
in
that
regard,
it
is...
it
is
notable
that
we
are
literally
alone
in
the
world
even
though
110
countries
in
the
world
permit
capital
punishment
for
one
purpose...
for
one
crime
or
another,
and
yet
every
one...
every
one
formally
renounces
it
for
juvenile
offenders.
and,
justice
kennedy,
my
submission
isn't
that
that
that's
set...
you
know,
game,
set,
and
match.
it's
just
relevant,
and
i
think
it
is
relevant
in
terms
of
the
existence
of
a
consensus.
there
was
reference
made
by
my
opponent
to
the
fact
that
there
are
four
states
that
set
the
age
at
17
and
four
states
that
set
the
age
at
16.
no...
in
terms
of
movement,
no
one
has
suggested
that
any
of
those
states
or
any
other
state
has
ever
lowered
the
age.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
those
particular...
those
eight
states,
a
number
of
them
legislated
an
age
that
represented
raising
the
number
over
what
had
previously
been
permitted.
the
movement,
as
this
court
addressed,
talked
about
in
atkins,
has
all
been
in
one
direction,
and
it's
not
as
if
that
movement,
in
and
of
itself,
answers
the
question.
but
where
you
have
the
type
of
consensus
that
exists
here,
as
it
did
in
atkins,
and
where
you
have
a
scientific
community
that
in
stanford
was
absent...
the
american
medical
association,
the
american
psychological
association,
the
american
psychiatric
association,
the
major
medical
and
scientific
associations,
were
not
able
in
1989,
based
on
the
evidence,
to
come
to
this
court
and
say
there
is
scientific,
empirical
validation
for
requiring
that
the
line
be
set
at
18.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
i
don't...
i
think
it's...
it
may
be
in
small
part
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
the
main
point
is
that
what
their
brief
looked
to...
what
the
argument
was
was
our...
are
adolescents
cognitively
different
than
adults.
and
the
answer
is,
as
we...
our
brief
concedes,
is
generally
no.
and
what
was
at
issue
in
the
abortion
cases
was
competency
to
decide.
and
just
as
we
allow
the
mentally
retarded
the
ability
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
obtain
an
abortion
but
not
to
be
subject
to
a
penalty
that
is
reserved
for
the
tiny
fraction
of
murderers
that
are
so
depraved
that
we
call
them
the
worst
of
the
worst,
here
competency
to
decide
here,
as
with
the
mentally
retarded,
isn't
the
issue.
christopher
simmons
was
found,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
to
have
committed
this
offense
with
the
specific
intent
necessary
to
do
it,
just
as
the
mentally
retarded
can
be.
the
issue
in
hodgson
was
cognitive
ability
to
be
able
to
make
a
competent
decision.
and
so
i
don't...
i
didn't
represent
the
apa
then
and
i
don't
now,
but
i
don't,
with
respect,
think
there's
an
inconsistency.
in
fact,
the
difference
here
goes
to
the
factors
that
atkins
identified
about
why
overwhelmingly
the
mentally
retarded...
and
here
adolescents...
are
less
morally
capable.
they
are
much,
much
less
likely
to
be
sufficiently
mature
to
be
among
the
worst
of
the
worst.
and
here,
even
more
than
with
the
mentally
retarded,
the
few
16
and
17-year-olds
who
might,
if
we
could
even
determine
it,
be...
we
could
determine
were
in
fact
so
depraved
that
they
were
among
the
worst
of
the
worst,
there
is
no
way
reliably
to
identify
them
and
there's
no
way
reliably
to
exclude
them.
and
it
is
in
this
respect
that
science
i
think
changes.
at
the
time
of
stanford,
everybody
on
this
court,
of
course,
knew
what
all
of
us
as
adults
intuitively
know,
which
is
that
adolescents...
and...
and
here
we're
talking
about...
i
agree
that
when
adolescence
starts
and
when
it
ends
is
undefined.
but
every
scientific
and
medical
journal
and
study
acknowledges
that
16
and
17-year-olds
are
the
heartland.
no
one
excludes
them.
and
what
we
know
from
the
science
essentially
explains
and
validates
the
consensus
that
society
has
already
developed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
one
could
have
said--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
the
number
of
states
that
engage
in
these
executions
is
very
small,
and
if
it
were
all
of
the
states,
none
of
this
court's
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
would
ever
have
to
come...
would
ever
have
to
be
developed.
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice...
justice
scalia,
there's
no
doubt...
and
the
jury
was
instructed...
that
age
is
a
mitigating
factor
although,
justice
kennedy,
in
response
to
your
question,
our
brief
points
out
prosecutors,
in
the
context
of
future
dangerousness,
which
is
relevant,
argue
it
all
the
time
and
jurors
intuitively
think
it
all
the
time.
but
the
fact
that
he
could
have
made
an
individualized
mitigating
case
or
argued
that
he
was
only...
that
he
was
young,
as
he
did,
doesn't
address
the
constitutional
problem.
the
constitutional
problem
is
that
overwhelmingly
16
and
17-year-olds,
for
reasons
of
the...
the
developmental
reasons
relating
to
their
psychosocial
character--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the...
about
the
character--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
the
trial
was...
i'm
making
an
observation
just
as
in...
as
in
atkins--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
not
making
an
argument
about
the
character
or
maturity
of
this
defendant,
which
would
have
been
the
only
thing
that
would
be--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i...
it's
an
argument
about
what
the
constitution
prohibits.
it's
an
argument
about
where
a
constitutional
line
should
be
drawn.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
instance
in
which
legislative
facts,
as
you
will
call
them,
that
is,
facts
that
go
to
where
a
line
should
be
drawn,
whether
it's
by
this
court
because
the
constitution
ought
to
be
so
interpreted
or
a
legislation
should
change,
would
be
properly
introduced
to
a
jury
that
is
supposed
to
accept
the
law,
that
has
required
to
accept
the
law
as
is
given
by
a
judge--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
the
habeas
proceeding,
it's...
it's...
an
argument
could
have
been
made
and,
indeed,
was
made
in
this
case
that
the
line...
that
under
atkins
juvenile
offenders
are
the
same
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
habeas...
if
you're
talking
about
the...
the
scientific
studies--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
peer-reviewed
journals,
it
was
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
we
certainly
could
have
had
a
psychiatrist
argue
that
in...
generally
speaking,
adolescents
are
less
mature
and
on
a
range
of
psychosocial
factors,
they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
but,
justice
kennedy,
i...
i
concede
that.
the
issue
for
this
court
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
the
application
of
law
to
a
particular
defendant,
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
this
way,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
jury
could
have
weighed
these
things,
but
there
is
no
way,
even
for
a
psychiatrist
or
a
psychologist,
much
less
a
juror
to...
to
be
confident
because
of
the
inherent,
documented
transiency
of
the
adolescent
personality.
no
psychiatrist
and
no
juror
can
say
with
confidence
that
the
crime
that
was
committed
by
a
16
or
17-year-old,
on
the
average
2
years
ago...
and
this
is
the
key
point...
proceeded
from
enduring
qualities
of
that
person's
character
as
opposed
to
the
transient
aspects
of
youth,
and
therefore--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--what
the
jury...
perhaps
i'm
not
understanding
your
point.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the...
the...
an
argument
to
the
jury
that
regardless
of
what
a
psychiatrist
or
a
psychologist
would
have
said
about
christopher
simmons,
as
a
group,
16
and
17-year-olds
have
such
labile
personalities
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
they're...
the
crime
that
they
committed
reflected
an
enduring
character
is
an
argument
that
could
have
been
made
to
spare
this
particular
defendant,
but
it
need
not
have
been
credited
or
given
dispositive
weight,
particularly
since
at
sentencing...
and
this
court
has
acknowledged
this
in
cases
like
pate
v.
robinson
and
drope
v.
illinois...
the
jury
is
evaluating
somebody,
determining
their
moral
blameworthiness
2
years
later.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
no.
what
i'm...
what
i'm
asking
you
to
do...
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
weight
of
scientific
and
medical
evidence
of
which
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
and
should
take
judicial
notice
and
did
take
judicial
notice
in
cases
like
atkins
and
thompson
and
stanford
explains
and
validates
the
consensus
that
society
has
drawn.
we're
not
arguing
that
the
science
or
what
a
particular
neurobiologist
or
developmental
psychologist
says
dictates
the
line
of
18.
the
question
is
we
have
a
consensus.
it's
even
more
robust
than
it
was
in
atkins.
looking
at
proportionality
and
reliability
with
respect
to
that
consensus,
is
there
a
good,
objective,
scientific
reason
to
credit
the
line
that
society
has
drawn?
and
i'm
suggesting
two
things.
number
one,
that
although
one
could
posit
that
there
are
16
and
17-year-olds
whose
antisocial
traits
are
characterological
rather
than
transient,
we
know
it
is
impossible...
we
know
this
from
common
sense
and
it's
been
validated
by
science,
of
which
the
court
can
take
note,
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
the
crime
that
was
committed
by
a
16
or
17-year-old
is
a
reflection
of
his
true,
enduring
character
or
whether
it's
a
manifestation
of
traits
that
are
exhibited
during
adolescence.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--here...
no.
well...
no.
here's
what
i
would
appeal
to.
i...
there
are
three
relevant
factors
that
this
court
has
to
look
at.
there's
the
determination
of
consensus.
is
there
enough
of
a
one
or
isn't
there?
there's
the
determination
of
proportionality,
and
then
there's
the
issue
identified
in
lockett
and
in
atkins,
which
is
how
reliable
is
the
individualized
sentencing
process.
how
reliably...
when
we're
talking
about
picking
the
tiny
few
who
are
the
worst
of
the
worst,
how
reliably
can
we
do
that?
we
think
that
with
respect
to
each
of
those,
we
have
demonstrated
that
the
eighth
amendment
requires
recognizing
18.
but
i
will
take
as
a
posit
your
hypothetical
question
that
i
haven't
convinced
you
on
number
one,
number
two,
or
perhaps
individually
on
all
three.
this
is
truly
a
case,
justice
kennedy,
in
which
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts.
taken
together,
the
fact
that
it's
impossible
for
a
jury
to
know
whether
the
crime
of
an
adolescent
was
really
the
feature
of
an
enduring
character,
since
we
know,
as
in
atkins,
that
many
of
the
characteristics
that
manifest
themselves
in
mental
retardation
also
affect
the
inability
of
adolescents
to
communicate
with
their
attorneys,
to
express
remorse,
that
2
years
later
when
this
person
is
on
trial,
physically,
emotionally
it's
not
the
same
person
that
the
jury
is
looking
at
and
being
asked
to
evaluate--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it's...
i
think
it's...
it's
more
than
that
in
a
couple
of
respects.
it...
it
explains,
corroborates,
and
validates
what
we
sort
of
intuitively
know,
not
just
as
parents
but
in
adults
that...
that...
who
live
in
a
world
filled
with
adolescents.
and...
and
the
very
fact
that
science...
and
i'm
not
just
talking
about
social
science
here,
but
the
important
neurobiological
science
that
has
now
shown
that
these
adolescents
are...
their
character
is
not
hard-wired.
it's
why,
for
example...
here's
a...
here's
an
interesting
and
relevant
scientific
fact.
psychiatrists
under
the
dsm,
the
diagnostic
and
statistical
manual,
which
is
their
bible,
are
precluded
from
making
a
diagnosis
of
antisocial
personality
before
the
age
of
18
precisely
because
before
the
age
of
18,
personality
and
character
are
not
fixed
even
with
respect
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i'm
not...
i
think
that
there
is
an
interesting
question
about...
with
respect
to
death,
whether
what
they
are
and
what
they
will
become
is
totally
irrelevant.
but
accepting
the
premise
of
your
question,
my
point
is
that
science
has
confirmed
what
we
intuitively
know,
which
is
that
when
the
jury
gets
around
to
evaluating
what
the
character
was
that
manifested
that
horrible
crime,
they
can't
tell
because
of
the
passage
of
age
and
because
of
a
number
of
confounding
factors
and
because
psychologists
and
psychiatrists
can't
tell
themselves
whether
the
crime
that
occurred
2
years
ago
or
2
weeks
ago
was
the
manifestation
of
an
enduring
character
or
transient
psychosocial
traits
that
rage
in
adolescence.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
only
part,
mr.
chief
justice.
part
of
it
is
that
the
jury,
of
course,
is
looking
at
the
defendant,
and
we
have
laid
before
the
court
peer-reviewed
scientific
studies
that
show
that
they...
that
people
are...
frequently
equate
maturity
and
psychosocial
development
with
race
and
with
physical
appearance.
in
addition,
because
the
adolescent
personality
is
transient
and
the
lapse
of
time
for
trial
is
2
years,
in
a
very
real
sense
psychosocially
as
opposed
to...
in
addition
to
physically,
the
person
that
the
jury
is
judging
is
not
the...
is
not
a
manifestation
of
the
person
who
committed
the
crime.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
even
if
it
were
in
6
weeks,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
process
is...
is
sufficiently...
that
would
just
make
the
youth
the
same
as
the
mentally
retarded,
because
the
mentally
retarded
have
stable
personalities
and
stable
characters,
and
yet,
what
this
court
said
in
atkins
was
we
have
two
things
to
say.
one
is
that
overwhelmingly
as
a
group
the
mentally
retarded
are
unlikely
to
be
among
the
very
worst
of
the
worst,
and
the
very
deficits
that
they
have...
that
you
called
deficits
in
reasoning,
judgment,
and
control
of
their
impulses,
makes
the
jury...
the
process
of
the
jury
evaluating
the
moral
culpability,
the
moral
blameworthiness
unreliable.
and
it's
on
the
basis
of
those
two
things
that
we
think
that
the
consensus
that's
otherwise
reflected
is
validated.
and
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i
am
also
concerned
about
it,
and
i...
i
have
thought
about
this.
first
of
all,
if
they
are
enlisted
by
people
over
the
age
of
18
to
do
that,
the...
the
precise
degree
of
culpability
goes
to
the
people
who
are
over
18,
and
juries
ought
to
consider
whether
people
who
are
over
the
age
of
18
have
so
enlisted
them.
but
even...
but
with
respect
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think...
i
think,
as
with
the
mentally
retarded,
or
in
fact,
even
more
than
with
the
mentally
retarded,
adolescents...
the...
the
role
of
deterrence
has
even
less
to
say,
precisely
because
they
weigh
risks
differently
and
they
don't
see
the
future
and
they
are
impulsive
and
they're
subject
to
peer
pressure.
and
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
what
happened
in
this
case,
it's
as
good
an
example
as
any.
the
state
says,
well,
okay,
you
know,
he...
you
know,
this
guy,
according
to
the
state's
witness,
the
person,
who
was
over
18
and
described
as
the
fagin
of
this
group
of
juveniles,
testified
to
the
court,
well,
christopher
simmons
says,
let's
do
it
because,
quote,
we
can
get
away
with
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
17-year-old
may
be
the
ringleader,
and
even
if
you
posit
that
christopher
simmons
was
the
ringleader
here,
he...
he
wasn't
under
any
illusions.
he
wasn't
making
a
statement
about
being
executed.
he
said,
we
could
get
away
with
it,
which
speaks
volumes
about
the...
the
extent
to
which...
this
guy
was
subject
to
life
without
parole,
which
is,
justice
scalia,
fundamentally
different
than
death.
this
court
has
said
that
only
when
the
penalty
is
death,
do
you
look
at
the
character
of
the
defendant
as
opposed
to
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
the
act.
but
the
data
shows...
and
i
think
this
court
has
acknowledged...
it
acknowledged
in
thompson
in
any
event...
that
the...
that
adolescents
like
the...
the
mentally
retarded
are
much
less
likely
to
be
deterred
by
the
prospect
of
an
uncertain,
even
if
probable,
very
substantial
penalty.
the...
no
mature
adult
would
have
thought,
as
chris
simmons
reportedly
said,
i
can
get
away
with
this
because
i'm
17
years
old,
when
the
mandatory
punishment
for
him
would
have
been
life
in
prison.
it's...
it
is
not...
eliminating
the
death
penalty
as
an
option,
which
is...
which
is
imposed
so
rarely
as
to
be
more
freakish
than
the
death
penalty
was
in
furman...
three
states
in
the
last
10
years,
one--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
and
i...
and
i...
the...
the
examples
in
the
alabama
brief
are
horrifying.
but
if
you
look
at
those
examples,
the
very
first
one,
this
is
a
kid
who
went
on
a
killing
spree,
including
his
father,
because
he
felt
he
was
unjustly
deprived
use
of
the
family
truck.
and
there...
i
can
go
through
the
other
examples,
but
these
are
posited
as
people
who
a
jury
could,
with
a
degree
of
reliability
that
the
constitution
requires,
say
acted
out
of
a
stable,
enduring
character
rather
than
transient
aspects
of
youth?
i
think
that's
a
poster
child
for
us.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--may
i
answer?
briefly.
the
line...
the
science
shows
what
common
sense
understands
which
is
that
development
is
a
continuum,
but
the
line,
18,
is
one
that
has
been
drawn
by
society.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
