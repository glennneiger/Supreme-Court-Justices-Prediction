we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
03-633,
donald
roper
v.
christopher
simmons.
mr.
layton.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't...
didn't
we
adopt
a
16-year-old
line
in
our
earlier
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
what
point
was
this
inserted
into
the
record,
mr.
layton?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
never...
never
tested
in
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
layton.
mr.
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what...
what
if
a
state
legislature
decides
that,
sure,
the
supreme
court
said
in
the
simmons
case
that
you
can't
execute
anybody
under
18,
but
we
think
there's
kind
of
a
tendency
the
other
way,
we're
going
to
pass
a
statute
and
see
what
happens
in
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it...
is
that
a
closed
book?
i
mean,
granted,
you
may
lose
the
argument,
but
is
it
a
permissible
argument
that
the
standards
have
evolved
the
other
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
one...
how
does
one
determine
what
is
the
better
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
we
adopt
that
principle?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
waxman,
was
that
in
evidence
that
you
referred
to
from
these
various
associations?
was
that
introduced
at
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
i
would
think
if
you
want
to
rely
on
evidence
like
that,
it
ought
to
be
introduced
at
trial
and
subject
to
cross
examination
rather
than
just
put
in
amicus
briefs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
but
you're
making
an
argument
that
science
says
people
this
age
are
simply
different,
and
it
seems
to
me
you...
if
that's
to
be
an
argument,
it
ought
to
be
introduced
at
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're...
you're
talking
facts
basically
and
facts
ordinarily
are
adduced
at
trial
for
cross
examination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
in
the...
how
about
in
the
habeas
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
this
evidence
adduced
at
the
habeas
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
that...
that
itself
is
a
purported
scientific
fact,
what
you
just
said,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
we're...
if
we're
to
rely
on
that,
it
ought
to
have
been
tested
in
the
way
most
facts
are.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're...
you're
relying
on
factual...
the
statement
you
just
made
was...
was
a
factual
statement
about
the
enduring
character,
et
cetera.
now,
if...
if
we
are
to
take
that
as
a
fact,
it
ought
to
have
been
tested
somewhere
rather
than
just
given
to
us
in
a
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
part
of
your
answer
based
on
the
length
of
time
between
the
killing
and
the
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
a
state
said
i
see
the
problem,
so
we'll
bring
this
person
to
trial
in
6
weeks?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
layton,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
layton.
the
case
is
submitted.
