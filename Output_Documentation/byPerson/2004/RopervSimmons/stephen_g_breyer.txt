is
there...
is
there
any
on...
on
that?
is
there
any
indication?
i
mean,
i've
never
seen
any
either
way,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
but...
that
madison
or
jefferson
or
whoever,
when
they
were
writing
the
constitution,
would
have
thought
what
happened
elsewhere,
let's
say,
in
britain
or
in
the
british...
they
were
a
british
colony.
they
did
think
blackstone
was
relevant.
did
any...
that
they
would
have
thought
it
was
totally
irrelevant
what
happened
elsewhere
in
the
world
to
the
word
unusual.
is
there
any
indication
in
any
debate
or
any
of
the
ratification
conventions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
lincoln--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--abraham
lincoln
used
to
study
blackstone
and
i
think
he
thought
that
the
founding
fathers
studied
blackstone,
and
all
that
happened
in
england
was
relevant,
is
there
some
special
reason
why
what
happens
abroad
would
not
be
relevant
here?
relevant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
controlling.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely,
and
they,
i
guess,
were
looking
at
english
practices,
and
would
they
have
thought
it
was
wrong
to
look
abroad
as
a
relevant
feature?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
go
off
on
this,
the
one
statistic
that
interested
me...
and
i'd
like
you
to
discuss
its
relevance
really...
is
if
we
look
back
10
years,
i
have
only
three
states
executing
a
juvenile:
texas,
11;
virginia,
3;
and
oklahoma,
2.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
those
three
states
account
for
about
11
percent
of
the
population
of
the
country,
11.3
percent.
now,
if
we
go
back
a
few
more
years
to
stanford,
we
get
three
others
in
there:
louisiana,
1;
georgia,
1;
and
missouri,
1.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
a
very
different
number.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
reason
that
i
thought
arguably
it's
more
relevant
to
look
at
the
convictions
is
there
are
a
lot
of
states.
say,
new
hampshire,
i
think,
for
example...
when
i
was
in
the
first
circuit,
there
were
several
states
that
on
the
books
permitted
the
death
penalty,
but
nobody
ever
had
ever
been
executed.
and...
and
that's
true
across
the
country.
there
are
a
number
of
states
like
that.
so
if
we
look
at
the
states
that
actually
execute
people,
it's
10
years,
say,
11
percent
of
the
population
are
in
such
states.
you
go
back
15
years,
and
you
get
these
three
other
states,
which
raises
the
percentage.
how...
how
should
i
understand
that?
i'm
interested
in
both
sides--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that...
that's...
that
last
point
was
what
i
thought
the
scientific
evidence
was
getting
at,
that
it
simply
confirmed
what
common
sense
suggests,
that
when
you
execute
a
person
15
or
sometimes
20
years
later,
a
problem
always
is
that
that
person
isn't
the
same
person
who
committed
the
trial
in
a
meaningful
sense.
and
it's
specially
true
of
16
and
17-year-olds
who,
observation
would
suggest,
have
a
lot
of
changing
to
do
because
their
personality
is
not
fully
formed.
now,
i
thought
that
the...
the
scientific
evidence
simply
corroborated
something
that
every
parent
already
knows,
and
if
it's
more
than
that,
i
would
like
to
know
what
more.
