mr.
james
r.
layton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
though
bound
by
stanford
v.
kentucky,
the
missouri
supreme
court
rejected
both
its
holding
and
its
rationale.
this
court
should
stay
the
course
it
set
in
stanford,
leaving
in
the
hands
of
legislators
a
determination
as
to
the
precise
minimum
age
for
capital
punishment
within
the
realm
of
thompson
v.
oklahoma,
and
leaving
to
jurors
responsibility
for
determining
the
culpability
of
individual
defendants
above
that
minimum
age.
the
missouri
court
justified
its
departure
from
stanford
on
atkins
v.
virginia,
but
the
result
it
reached
is
quite
different
from
the
result
in
stanford.
in
that...
excuse
me...
in
atkins.
in
that
case,
the
court
was
addressing
mental
ability,
itself
a
component
of
culpability.
the
court
announced
a
principle
based
on
that
characteristic,
that
is,
that
the
mentally
retarded
are
not
to
be
eligible
for
capital
punishment,
but
then
it
left
to
the
states
the
determination
of
the
standard
and
the
means
of
implementing
that
principle.
the
missouri
supreme
court,
by
contrast,
jumped
beyond
the
question
of
maturity,
which
is
an
element
of
culpability
analysis,
to
the
arbitrary
distinction
of
age.
it
drew
a
line
based
purely
on
age,
which
is
necessarily
over-inclusive,
and
then
it
gave
that
line
constitutional
status,
thus
depriving
legislators
and
juries
of
the
ability
to
evaluate
the
maturity
of
17-year-old
defenders.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
the
states
certainly--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--there
is
some
minimal
level.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i...
i
don't
agree
that
it
would
be
over-inclusive,
given
the
court's
analysis
in
atkins.
the
court
said
that
someone
who
has
that
level
of
mental
retardation
is
simply
not
sufficiently
culpable
by
definition.
that
certainly
would
not
be
true
here.
there
are
17-year-olds
who
are
equally
culpable
with
those
who
are
18,
20,
25,
or
some
other
age.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i
think
that
legislators
would
be
surprised,
when
they
adopted
those
statutes,
that
they
were
affecting
their
criminal
law.
in
fact,
many
of
those
statutes
have
individualized
determinations,
the
military
being
one
of
them.
17-year-olds
can
enlist.
there
is
an
individualized
determination,
albeit
by
parents,
not
the
government.
17-year-olds
may
be
serving
in
iraq
today.
that...
the
other
kinds
of
examples
that
you
cite,
for
example,
tobacco--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
although
in
most
instances
can
marry
if
they
go
to
a
court
and
demonstrate
they
are
sufficiently
mature,
again
contemplating
individualized
determination,
which
the
missouri
supreme
court
says
does
not
exist
as
to
17-year-olds
with
regard
to
capital
punishment.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
i...
i
must
assume
that
if
we...
if
the
court
says
they
are
immune
from
the...
from
capital
punishment
that
someone
will
come
and
say
they
also
must
be
immune
from,
for
example,
life
without
parole.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
the...
the
problem
with
adopting
the...
the
18-year-old
line
is
that
it
is
essentially
arbitrary.
it's
the
kind
of
line
that
legislators
and
not
courts
adopt.
mr.
james
r.
layton
in...
in
thompson,
the
court
in
a
4-1-4
decision
struck
a
15-year-old...
a
15-year-old
execution,
and
the
states
have
taken,
including
missouri
through
its
general
assembly,
have
taken
that
to
mean
that
there
is
a
16-year-old
line.
and
today,
in
fact,
i
think
it's
true
that
there
is
a
consensus
nationally
with
regard
to
the
16-year-old
line,
not
because
it
has
some
biological
or
psychological
magic,
but
because
perhaps--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--absolutely,
that's
true.
if
you
look
at
the...
the--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--the...
the
court
has
kind
of
three
groups
of
cases
with
regard
to
the
number
of
states.
on
one
extreme,
are
enmund
and
coker
where
you
have
three
and
eight
states.
on
the
other
extreme,
are
penry
and
stanford
where
you
have
24
and
34
states.
and
then
there's
this
middle
group,
which
isn't
just
atkins
and
this
case.
it's
also
tison,
which
is
also
almost
exactly
the
same
number.
the
court
in
atkins
had
to
find
a
way
of
distinguishing
tison,
to
the
extent
the
court
relied
on
that...
that
counting
process,
and
the...
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
kind
of
an
inexorable
trend
with
regard
to
the
mentally
retarded.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
trend
here.
in--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--well,
two
things.
number
one
is
that
capital
sentences
have
been
dropping
for
all
ages,
not
just
for
those
under
18.
so
it...
you
have
to
take
that
into
account.
the
second
is
that
although
the
last--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--it
is--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--it
is
not--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--it
is
certainly
greater,
but
part
of
the
problem
is
we're
dealing
with
such
small
numbers
for
the...
the
juveniles,
those
under
18,
that
the
difference
of
one
or
two
makes
a
huge
difference
in
how
the
numbers
come
out.
but
if
you
look
over
the
last
10
years,
in
fact,
it
has
gone
up
and
down
and
currently
is
in
a
down
trend,
but
the
down
trend--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--it...
it
went
up
once
within...
since...
since
stanford
and
then
came
back
down.
now,
whether
this...
this
period
in
which
it
comes
back
down
is
going
to
remain
that
way
or
whether
we'll
go
back
up
to
where
we
were
10
years
ago
i
don't
know.
that's
entirely
hypothetical
to
suggest
that...
that
this
very
recent
trend
is
more
dispositive
than
the
trends
over
the
last
10
years.
mr.
james
r.
layton
right.
mr.
james
r.
layton
right,
and
the
time
is
too
short
on
the
legislative
side
as
well.
we're
only
talking
about
the
states
that
have
adopted
new
legislation
having
done
so,
one
of
them
in
1999
and
the
others
simply
in
2002
and
2004.
if
we
were
to
look
at
the
history
of...
of
capital
punishment
in
the
united
states,
there
are
many
times
when
states
have
abolished
capital
punishment
and
then
returned.
and
justice--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--no.
it--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--since...
since
stanford,
we
have
had
no
executions
under
16
even
though
it
is
possible
to
read
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
that
case
as
allowing
a
state
to
adopt
a
statute
that
specifically
says
15.
no
one
has
tried
that.
everyone
seems
to
have
taken
thompson
and
stanford
together
to
mean
there
is
a
16-year-old
line.
two
states
have
adopted
16
by
statute.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i...
i
think
that
that's
right.
there
are
states
that
have
adopted
it
specifically
and
others
have
simply
implemented
it.
if
i
were
a
prosecutor
today,
i...
it's
hard
to
imagine
that
i
would...
even
in
a
state
where
i
could
find
a
statute
saying
i
could
prosecute
someone
under
age
16,
that
i
would
try
such
a
thing.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i...
i
don't
know
how
it
could
be
anything
but
mitigating.
but
what
we
have
in
that--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--in
that
statement,
but--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--no.
what...
what
he's
facing
is...
is
18
pages
of
transcript
that
occupied
the...
the
defense
counsel's
argument.
of
those
18
pages,
4
pages
are
dedicated
purely
to
mr.
simmons'
youth,
and
throughout
the
rest
of
the
argument,
he
uses
terms
to
reinforce
that.
he
refers
to
him
repeatedly
as
a
17-year-old.
he
calls
him
a
kid.
he
does
things
to
reinforce
with
the
jury
that
he's
very
young.
so
then
we
come
back
and
in
a
few
pages
of
rebuttal,
we
have
a
couple
of
words...
i
shouldn't
say
that...
two
sentences
in
which
the
prosecutor
is
trying
to
respond
to
that
particular
lengthy
theme
and
argument.
mr.
james
r.
layton
and
if
we
were
here
because
mr.
simmons
said
that
was
improper
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
that
was
improper,
well,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
wouldn't
have
asked
for
certiorari.
the
court
wouldn't
have
granted
it.
mr.
james
r.
layton
the
missouri
statute
requires
that
an
instruction
be
given
that
says
that
age
is
a
mitigator,
and
the...
the
instruction
was
given
here.
and
the
jury
heard
argument
concerning
that
particular
claim.
mr.
james
r.
layton
aggravating,
but
aggravating--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--well,
you're
right,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--it
is--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--yes.
and...
and--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--certainly
aggravating
circumstances
are
defined
in
the
missouri
statute,
and
they
were
defined
in
the
instructions.
so
this
was
not
to
be
considered
by
the
jury
as
an
aggravator.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no
more
than
if
we
were
one
of
the
very
few
countries
that
didn't
do
this.
it
would
bear
on
the
question
of
unusual.
the
decision
as
to
the
eighth
amendment
should
not
be
based
on
what
happens
in
the
rest
of
the
world.
it
needs
to
be
based
on
the
mores
of...
of
american
society.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i
don't
know
how
they've
done
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
in
fact--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i...
i
believe
that--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
believe
that
there
are
countries
in
europe
who
abolish
it
because
of
their
membership
in
the
european
union--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i...
i
can't
concede
that
it
does
because
it's
unimaginable
to
me
that
we
would
be
willing
to
accept
the
alternative,
the
flip
side
of
that
argument.
it
does
seem
to
me,
however,
that
that
goes
to
a
particular...
back
to
the
aspect
where
i
began--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--nothing
that
i
have
seen
has
suggested
that--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
james
r.
layton
there's
a--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--there's
a
special
reason
why
blackstone
would
be
relevant
because
that
was
the
law
from
which
they
were
operating
when
they
put
this
language
into
the
constitution.
mr.
james
r.
layton
and...
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i...
i
have
not
seen
that
overtly
in
any
of
the
court's
opinions,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
layton
oh,
i...
i
think
mr.
jefferson
thought
that.
i
think
many
of
the
founders
thought
that
they
were
leading
the
world,
and
i
have
no
objection
to
us
leading
the
world,
but
mr.
jefferson's
lead
of
the
world
was
through
the
legislature
not
through
the
courts.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that...
that
may
well
be.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i
read
a
biography
of
john
adams
recently.
i
recall
that
he
didn't
think
highly
of
them.
[laughter]
the...
missouri,
in
order
to
implement
the
principle
that
those
who
are
immature
should
not
be
subject
to
capital
punishment,
has
adopted
an
approach
that,
first
off,
excludes
anyone
age
16
and
under
from
capital
punishment;
second,
requires
certification
by
the
juvenile
court
for
anyone
who
is
16,
but
otherwise
turns
the
matter
over
to
the
jury
and
defines
it
as
a
statutory
mitigator.
the
kind
of
evidence
that
is
discussed
in
mr.
simmons'
brief
at
some
length
could
have
been
applied...
could
have
been
presented
during
the
penalty
phase
of
mr.
simmons'
trial.
it
has
been
reflected
in
decisions
of
this
court
as
far
back
as
eddings
where
there
was
evidence
of
mental
and
emotional
development.
in
penry,
there
was
evidence
of
mental
age
and
social
maturity.
and
here,
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding,
mr.
simmons
presented
such
evidence
regarding
his
impulsivity,
his
susceptibility
to
peer
pressure,
and
his
immaturity.
but
he
didn't
present
that
at
trial.
there
is
a
mechanism
in
missouri
for
him
to
do
that
and
he
chose
not
to.
mr.
james
r.
layton
correct.
mr.
james
r.
layton
and
if
you
go
to
the
convictions
rather
than
the
executions,
then
alabama
goes
into
that
mix.
mr.
james
r.
layton
right.
mr.
james
r.
layton
frankly,
we
don't
know
what
those
numbers
mean
because
we
don't
know
to
what
extent
juveniles
are
committing
capital
level
murders.
we...
and
there
is
no
way
in
current
social
science
to
make
that
determination.
it's
interesting
that
among
the
three
states...
two
of
the
three
states
that
are
on
that
list
that
justice
breyer
mentioned
are
states
in
which
there
is
a
specific
instruction
to
the
jury,
or
indeed,
in
texas,
a
requirement,
that
the
jury
evaluate
future
dangerousness.
that
is,
the
argument
that
was
referred
to
by
opposing...
or
that
counsel
made,
the
state's
counsel
made,
the
prosecutor
made,
in
the...
in
the
trial
here,
there's
actually
an
instruction
in
some
of
those
states.
and
that
may
play
into
the
manner
in
which
this...
those
states...
the
reason
those
states
have
additional
convictions
and
additional
executions.
but
missouri
doesn't
have
that.
we
don't
require
that
the
jury
find
future
dangerousness,
and
although
that
may
come
up
in
the
course
of
a
mitigation
and
aggravation
argument
in
the
penalty
phase,
it
isn't
highlighted
like
it
is
in
those
states.
and
that
may
be
more
problematic
than
the
system
that
missouri
has
created.
if
the
kind
of
evidence,
psychosocial
evidence,
that
is
cited
in
mr.
simmons'
brief
had
been
presented
at
the
penalty
phase,
of
course
there
would
have
been
an
opportunity
to
rebut
it,
to
question
it.
instead,
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
marshaling
of
untested
evidence
from
various
cause
groups
and
some
dispassionate
observers.
mr.
james
r.
layton
the...
the
kind
of...
well,
as
to
mr.
simmons
specifically,
it
came
in
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding,
and
then
was
also
present
in
the
habeas
record.
in
this
case,
the...
the
lengthy
litany
of
scientific
studies
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
his
brief
in
this
court.
there
were
references
to
a
few
of
them
before,
but
nothing--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--oh,
no.
oh,
no,
because
he
never
made
the
argument
in
the
trial
court
during
his
trial
that...
that
scientifically
he
was
too
immature
to
be
culpable
to
the
degree
that
would
merit
capital
punishment.
mr.
james
r.
layton
absolutely.
mr.
james
r.
layton
absolutely.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i...
and
i
think
the
reason
that
we
did
that
and
we
cited
the
difficulties
in
our
reply
brief
with
what
he
cited
is
to
highlight
that
the
precise
age
is
a
legislative
question
based
on
legislative
type
facts.
legislatures
can
evaluate
this
series
of
studies
and
then
pick
what
is
essentially
an
arbitrary
age.
there
is
no
study
in
anything
that
mr.
simmons
cites
that...
that
justifies
that
particular
day,
18.
they
talk
about
adolescence.
they
talk
about
young
adolescence,
old
adolescence.
they
talk
about
adolescence
continuing
until
the
mid-20's.
nothing
justifies
the
age
of
18.
that
makes
it
the
kind
of
fact
that
a
legislature
ought
to
be
evaluating,
not
a
court.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
the...
the
studies
point
out
that
adolescence
is...
well,
they
don't
agree
on
what
adolescence
means,
and
they
don't...
and
they
point
out
that
it
begins
and
ends
on
different
times
for
different
people.
so
we
don't
know
what
adolescence
means
in
the
studies,
and
we
don't
know
what
it
would
mean
were
the
court
to
base
a
decision
on
the...
this
concept
of
adolescence.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
mr.
james
r.
layton
mr.
simmons,
of
course,
was
found
by
the
jury
to
be
the
ringleader.
and
in
essence,
that
creates
a
contrast
with
the
lee
malvo
case
where
we
had
something
like
what
justice
kennedy
referred
to,
adults
influencing
a
juvenile,
and
the
jury
was
able
to
make
that
distinction
in
the
virginia
lee
malvo
case.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i...
i
think
that
they
are
of
equal
weight
in
the
minds
of
the
legislators
in
the
state
of
missouri.
the...
mr.
simmons'
counsel
comes
to
the
edge
of
asking
this
court
to--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
from
all
that
i
have
read,
the
evidence
both
directions
is
inconclusive,
your
honor,
and
thus,
subject
to
legislators'
determination.
mr.
simmons'
counsel
comes
to
the
edge
of
asking
the
court
to
elevate
proportionality
to
be
equivalent
to...
to
a
consensus.
but
let
me
just
highlight
two
aspects
of
the
non-capital
case
proportionality
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
justice
kennedy,
in...
in
harmelin
recently
cited
by
the
plurality
in
ewing,
pointed
out
that
two
of
the
considerations
in
proportionality
review
in
those
instances
are
the
primacy
of
the
legislature
and
the
nature
of
the
federal
system.
what
we
should
have
here
is
a
principle
that
is
a
principle
dealing
with
immaturity,
and
the
states,
within
the
federal
system,
should
be
able
to
make
the
determination
as
to
how
to
implement
it.
as
pointed
out,
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
eighth
amendment
areas
has
proven
to
be
a
one-way
ratchet,
and
because
of
that,
the
court
has
to
be
very
wary
of
leading
rather
than
reflecting
societal
norms.
now,
there
are
some
states,
of
course,
that
have
raised
the
age,
the
minimum
age,
for
capital
punishment,
but
at
least
in
some
instances,
such
as
missouri,
that
is
a
reaction
to
this
court's
jurisprudence,
that
is,
a
reaction
to
thompson
and
stanford.
other
states
have
left
18
for
other
purposes,
and
yet
there
still
is
a
role
by
this
court.
pornography
is
an
example.
i
am
confident
that
but
for
this
court's
first
amendment
jurisprudence,
the
missouri
general
assembly
would
adopt
a
statute
that
said
that
pornography
should
not
be
allowed
at
ages
much
higher
than
18
and
not
because
of
maturity,
but
because
of
their
opposition
to
pornography.
in
many
of
the
instances
cited
by
mr.
simmons,
the
kind
of
statutes
that
he
cites,
gambling
and
others,
it
is
a
compromise
in
the
legislative
arena,
not
necessarily
based
on
maturity
or
immaturity,
that
leads
to
the
selection
of
the
age
of
18.
many
states
have,
of
course,
individualized
determinations
with
regard
to
those
statutes.
there
was
a
discussion
of
driver's
licenses.
in
missouri,
of
course,
we
allow
people
to
drive
at
age
15.
they
have
to
have
parental
consent,
yes,
but
there
also
is
a
test.
that
is,
there
is
an
individualized
determination
before
we
do
that,
and
that's
what
the
state
requests
here.
mr.
simmons'
counsel
points
out
that
in
atkins
the
court
took
judicial
notice
of
psychosocial
evidence,
and
that's
true.
the
court
did.
but
remember
that
what
the
court
had
before
it
in
atkins
was
not
a
proxy
for
a...
a
factor
that
plays
into
culpability.
it
was,
in
fact,
the
factor
itself,
that
is
mental
capacity.
and
what
they
want
here
is
not
a
determination
as
to
the
maturity
or
the
capacity
of
individuals.
they
want
a
bright
line
test
that
is
based
purely
on
age.
this
court
should
adopt,
as
it
did
in
atkins,
a
principle
and
leave
it
to
the
states
to
act.
that's
what
the
court
did
in--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--well,
if
that's
the
bright
line.
we
don't
know
whether
they're
mature
or
immature,
and
we
have
to
measure
that
somehow.
mr.
james
r.
layton
because
the...
having
a
bright
line
test
means
that
the
individual
who
murders
at
age
17,
364
days
is
treated
differently
than
a
more...
a
less
mature
individual
who
is
2
days
older.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes,
it
is,
and
it's
an
arbitrary
line
that
the
legislatures
have
set
because
it's
a
legislative
type
determination
based
on
what
even
mr.
waxman
called
legislative
facts.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
[laughter]
mr.
james
r.
layton
that's
not
for
this
court
to
decide.
congress
should
consider
that.
the
legislatures
should
consider
that.
it's
an
important
consideration,
but
it
is
not
a
consideration
under
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
james
r.
layton
within
the
parameters
of...
of
thompson
and
stanford,
yes.
yes.
the
missouri
supreme
court...
the
atkins
v.
virginia...
in
atkins
v.
virginia,
this
court
did
not
authorize
the
missouri
supreme
court
to
reject
stanford.
the
court
should
refuse
to...
to
sanction
such
activity
by
the
lower
courts
and
continue
the
course
it
set
in
that
decision.
thank
you.
