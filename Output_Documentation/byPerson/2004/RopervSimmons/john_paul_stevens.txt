justice
john
paul
stevens
but
of
course,
the
death
penalty
was
not
a
deterrent
for
any
of
the
crimes
described
in
the
alabama
brief
because
those
are
all...
crimes
all
occurred
in
states
which
execute
people
under
18.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
mr.
layton?
this
case
kind
of
raises
a
question
about
the
basic
state
interests
that
are
involved
here,
and
the
state
interests
that
justify
the
death
penalty
include
deterrence
and
also
retribution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
if
either,
of
those
do
you
think
is
the
primary
state
interest
you
seek
to
vindicate
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
further?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
death
penalty
for
those
under
18
or
even
above
has,
in
fact,
had
any
deterrent
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
one...
one
of
the
objections
in...
in
atkins
was
we
needed
a
bright
line
test.
we'd
have
difficulty
determining
which
ones
are
mentally
retarded.
here
we
don't
have
that
problem
at
all.
i
guess
everybody
knows
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
over
or
under
18.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the...
but
the
purpose
of
a
bright
line
test
is
to
avoid
litigation
over
the
borderline
cases,
and
you
just
have
completely
avoided
that
in
this
category.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
an
equally
arbitrary
line
if
it's
16,
17,
or
15.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one...
have
you
read
the
brief
of
the
former
u.s.
diplomats
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
we
should
give
any
credence
whatsoever
to
the
arguments
they
make?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
respect
of
other
countries
for
our
country
is
something
we
should
totally
ignore.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
leave
it
up
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
missouri
to
resolve
those
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
ropper
against
simmons.
