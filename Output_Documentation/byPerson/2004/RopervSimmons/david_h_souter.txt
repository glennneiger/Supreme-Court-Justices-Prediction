justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we...
we
have
a
different
kind
of
trend.
what
do
you
make...
you
spoke
of
a
consensus,
but
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
over
the
last,
i
guess,
10
or
12-year
period,
the
actual
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for...
for
those
whose
crimes
were...
were
under
18
has...
has
steadily
been
dropping.
i
think
10
years
ago,
there
were
13.
last
year,
i...
i
think
the
figures
were
that
there
were
two.
the...
the
consensus
seems
to
be
eroding,
and
yet
as...
as
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
pointed
out,
this
has
been
occurring
at
a
time
when...
when
treating
juvenile
crime
seriously
has
not,
in
fact,
been
eroding
at
all.
what...
what
are
we
supposed
to
make
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
has...
has
the...
has
the
rate
of
attrition
been
the
same?
justice
david
h.
souter
13
to
2
is
pretty
spectacular.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
think
we've
seen
that,
or
maybe
we
have
seen
that,
for...
for
death
imposition
generally.
is
that
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
went
up
once
i
think,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so...
so
you're
basically--
--you're...
you're
basically
saying
that
the...
the
time
is
too
short,
the
numbers
are
too
small--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
infer
anything.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
he's
simply
quoting
public
sources,
you
had
a
chance
to
quote
public
sources
in...
in
return.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
think
you're...
you're
even
on
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
at
least
your
opportunity
is.
