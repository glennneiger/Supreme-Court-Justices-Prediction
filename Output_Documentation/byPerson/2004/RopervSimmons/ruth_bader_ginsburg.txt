but
the
age
18
is
set
even
for
such
things
as
buying
tobacco.
the...
the
dividing
line
between
people
who
are
members
of
the
community,
the
adult
community,
is
pervasively
18,
to
vote,
to
sit
on
juries,
to
serve
in
the
military.
why
should
it
be
that
someone
is
death-eligible
under
the
age
of
18
but
not
eligible
to
be
an
adult
member
of
the
community?
justice

but
with
parental...
they
are
wards
of
their
parents.
justice

so
their
parents...
the
same
thing
with
marriage.
a
17-year-old
can
marry
but
not
without
parental
consent.
justice

it
was
pretty
clear.
the...
the
words
in
question
were:
think
about
age.
17
years
old.
isn't
that
scary?
doesn't
that
scare
you?
mitigating?
quite
the
contrary
i
submit.
quite
the
contrary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is,
can...
is...
is
age,
youth
inevitably
mitigating,
and
here
is
a
prosecutor
giving
the
answer
no,
it
can
be
aggravating.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
he
not
also
say
that
to...
to
lead
the
world,
we
would
have
to
show
a
decent
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind?
