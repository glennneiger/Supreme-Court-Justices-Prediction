justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
didn't
leave
it
up
to
the
states
entirely.
i
mean,
you...
you
mean
the
states
could
adopt
any
definition
of
mental
retardation
they
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's...
there's
some
minimal
level
of
mental
retardation.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
isn't
that
necessarily
over-inclusive,
just
as
picking
any
single
age
is
necessarily
over-inclusive?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
there
will
be
some
people
who...
who,
although
they
have
that
level
of
mental
retardation,
with
regard
to
the
particular
crime
in
question,
are
deserving
of
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
pick...
why
pick
on
the
death
penalty?
i
mean,
if
you're
going
to
say
that
somehow
people
under
18
are
juveniles
for
all
purposes,
why...
why
just
pick
on
the
death
penalty?
why...
why
not
say
they're
immune
from
any
criminal
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
that...
i'm
sure
that
would
follow.
i...
i
don't
see
where
there's
a
logical
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's...
what's
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
the
contrary
of...
of
mitigating?
i...
i
would
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it?
i...
i
would
assume
it's
not
mitigating.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
opposite
of
mitigating
is
aggravating,
but
it...
it's
perfectly
good
english
to
say,
mitigating?
quite
the
contrary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
at
all
mitigating.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
know
why
you
give
that
one
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
the
countries
of
the
european
union
abolished
the
death
penalty
by
popular
vote?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
they
did
it
by
reason
of
a
judgment
of
a
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
required
all
of
them
to
abolish
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
thought
that
some
of
the
public
opinion
polls
in...
in
a
number
of
the
countries
support
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
did
john
adams
think
of
the
french?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
does
adolescence
as
a
scientific
term...
does
it
always
occur
on
the
same
day
for...
for
all
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
the
constitutional
calculus
ever
move
in
the
other
direction?
i
mean,
once
we
hold
that,
you
know,
16
is
the
age,
if
there's
new
scientific
evidence
that
shows
that
some
people
are
quite
mature
at
18
or
at...
at
17-and-a-half
or
if...
if
there
is
a...
a
new
feeling
among
the
people
that
youthful
murderers
are,
indeed,
a
serious
problem
and...
and
deterrence
is
necessary,
can
we
ever
go
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
a
one-way
ratchet.
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't...
we
don't
use
18
for
everything.
aren't
there
states
that...
that
allow
adolescents
to
drive
at
the
age
of
16?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
their
parents'
consent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
their
parents'
consent,
how
many?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
can
drive.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
okay
with
the
parents,
it's
okay
with
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
a
lot
of
customs
that
we
don't
have.
they
don't
allow
most...
almost
all
of
them
do
not
allow...
have
trial
by
jury.
should
we...
and
they
think
it's
not
only
more
efficient,
it
is
fairer
because
juries
are,
you
know,
unpredictable
and
whatnot.
should
we
yield
to
the
views
of
the
rest
of
the
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
all
of
this
is
so
clear,
why
can't
the
state
legislature
take
it
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it's
such
an
overwhelming
case
that...
that
we
can
prescribe
it
for
the
whole
country,
you
would
expect
that
the
number
of
states
that...
that
now
permit
it
would
not
permit
it.
all
you
have
to
do
is
bring
these
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
legislature,
and
they
can
investigate
the
accuracy
of
the
studies
that
the
american
psychological
association
does
or
other
associations
in
a
manner
that
we
can't.
we
just
have
to
read
whatever
you
put
in
front
of
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
precisely
because
the
jury
considers
youthfulness
as
one
of
the
mitigating
factors.
it
doesn't
surprise
me
that
the
death
penalty
for
16
to
18-year-olds
is
rarely
imposed.
i
would
expect
it
would
be.
but
it...
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
evaluate
the
person's
youth
and
take
that
into
account
or
whether
you
adopt
a
hard
rule
that
nobody
who
is
under
18
is...
is...
has
committed
such
a
heinous
crime
with
such
intent
that
he...
that
he
deserves
the
death
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
i...
i
thought
we
punish
people,
criminals,
for
what
they
were,
not
for
what
they
are.
i
mean,
you
know,
if
you
have
someone
who
commits
a
heinous
crime
and
by
the
time
he's
brought
to
trial
and
convicted,
he's
come
to
jesus,
we
don't
let
him
off
because
he's
not
now
what
he
was
then.
it
seems
to
me
we
punish
people
for
what
they
were.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
say
that
adolescents
change,
everybody
changes,
but
that
doesn't
justify
eliminating
the...
the
proper
punishments
that
society
has
determined.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
if
it
had
been
done
by
an
18-year-old,
a
jury
could
have
said
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
an
18-year-old
did
the
same
thing,
you
say,
well,
he's
certainly
stable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
will
summarize
my
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas.
today
the
court
announces
that
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
has
changed
in
the
15
years
since
we
decided
stanford
versus
kentucky,
which
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
capital
punishment
for
offenders
who
committed
crimes
after
the
age
of
16
but
under
the
age
of
18.
the
court
holds,
mind
you,
not
that
our
decision
15
years
ago
was
wrong,
but
that
our
constitution's
meaning
has
changed.
it
reaches
this
implausible
result
by
purporting
to
advert
to
"the
evolving
standards
of
decency"
of
our
national
society.
it
finds
that
a
national
consensus
that
could
not
be
perceived
in
our
people's
laws
barely
15
years
ago
now
solidly
exists.
that
is
so
the
court
says
because
since
stanford,
four
states
have
changed
their
laws
to
forbid
execution
of
under
18
offenders.
justice
kennedy
said
five
states
one
of
those
five
did
not
change
its
laws
a
court
change
the
laws,
a
court
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional,
in
other
words
if
there
is
any
change
in
consensus
it
is
the
consensus
of
judges
not
of
the
people.
one
wonders
whether
those
four
states
would
even
changed
their
laws.
had
they
known
that
this
court
by
a
stroke
of
a
pen
would
make
the
change
irrevocable?
taking
this
issue
forever
off
the
table
of
legislative
debate.
but
even
with
the
change
of
those
four
states
a
majority
of
the
states
that
have
capital
punishment
still
leave
it
to
the
jury
to
decide
whether
the
particular
juvenile
given
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
murder
should
be
punished
as
an
adult.
so
we
have
here
the
rare
phenomenon
of
a
national
consensus
that
is
a
minority
view.
worse
still,
the
court
says
in
so
many
words
that
the
national
consensus
reflected
by
our
people's
laws
does
not
in
the
last
analysis
matter.
in
the
end
the
court
explains
"our
own
judgment
will
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
question
of
acceptability
of
the
death
penalty
under
the
eighth
amendment."
the
court
thus
proclaims
itself
sole
arbiter
of
our
nation's
moral
standards.
in
the
course
of
discharging
that
awesome
responsibility
the
court
credits
a
number
of
arguments
that
were
specifically
and
quite
correctly
rejected
by
this
very
court
15
years
ago.
for
example,
today's
opinion
says
that
the
infrequency
of
juvenile
executions
shows
that
our
society
has
set
its
face
against
--
it
shows
nothing
of
this
sort
we
said
in
stanford.
what
it
shows
is
that
juries
takes
youth
in
to
account
where
appropriate.
today?s
opinion
says
the
nation
laws
on
drinking,
driving
and
voting
proved
that
18
is
the
appropriate
age
of
accountability.
they
prove
nothing
of
this
sort
we
said
in
stanford.
not
only
because
it
takes
a
lot
more
responsibility
to
drive,
drink
and
vote
responsibly
than
not
to
commit
murder
but
also
because
those
laws
are
not
applied
on
an
individualized
basis,
whereas
juries
evaluate
the
majority
of
the
juvenile
defendants
one
by
one.
the
court
relies
selectively
on
social
scientific
studies,
failing
to
acknowledge
that
for
every
study
telling
the
court
what
it
wants
to
hear
there
is
another
that
says
the
opposite.
indeed
there
are
sometimes
contradictory
assurances
from
the
same
supposedly
scientific
source.
the
american
psychological
association
for
example
claims
in
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
that
scientific
evidence
shows
persons
under
18
lack
the
ability
to
take
moral
responsibility
for
their
decisions.
15
years
ago
in
its
brief
in
hodgson
versus
minnesota
the
same
apa
said
the
following
"by
middle
adolescence
age
14-15,
young
people
develop
abilities
similar
to
adults
in
reasoning
about
moral
dilemmas,
understanding
social
rules
and
laws
and
reasoning
about
interpersonal
relationships
and
interpersonal
problems".
to
assist
this
in
that
earlier
case
hodgson
the
apa
slided
"a
rich
body
of
research"
showing
that
juveniles
are
mature
enough
to
decide
whether
to
obtain
an
abortion
without
parental
involvement,
which
takes
greater
maturity,
do
you
suppose.
deciding
whether
to
have
an
abortion
or
deciding
what
the
17
year
old
defendant
in
this
case
had
to
decide,
whether
to
throw
a
live
and
conscious
woman
to
her
death
over
a
bridge.
the
court
displays
a
deep
distrust
of
our
jury
system
asserting
that
juries
will
be
unable
to
weigh
the
defendant's
youth
along
with
the
other
mitigating
and
aggravating
factors
of
his
crime.
this
conclusion
which
is
based
on
no
evidence
at
all
undermines
the
very
foundations
of
our
capital
sentencing
system.
we
have
long
trusted
jury's
with
as
we
have
described
it
"making
the
difficult
and
uniquely
human
judgments
that
defy
codification
and
that
it
build
equity
and
flexibility
in
to
a
legal
system".
there
is
no
reason
to
believe,
in
fact
there
is
an
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
jurors
not
take
seriously
their
responsibility
to
weigh
youth
as
a
mitigating
factor.
though
the
views
of
our
own
citizens
are
essentially
irrelevant
to
today's
decision,
the
views
of
other
countries
and
the
so-called
international
community
takes
center
stage.
the
fact
that
other
countries
and
international
agreements
to
which
the
united
states
is
not
a
party
have
condemned
execution
of
under
18
offenders
is
a
significant
part
of
the
courts
analysis.
the
underlying
thesis
that
american
law
should
conform
to
laws
to
the
rest
of
the
world
is
indefensible.
it
is
our
constitution
that
this
court
is
charged
with
expounding.
the
laws
of
foreign
nations
and
treaties
to
which
this
nation
has
not
subscribed
should
have
no
bearing
upon
that
exercise.
of
course
the
court
only
invokes
comparative
laws
selectively.
it
has
ignored
foreign
law
for
example
when
declaring
that
unmerandized
confessions
must
be
excluded.
forbidding
any
direct
assistance
to
religiously
affiliated
schools
or
creating
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
abortion
on
demand,
all
dispositions
that
differ
significantly
from
the
laws
of
most
other
countries.
the
court
should
either
profess
its
willingness
to
reconsider
all
these
matters
in
light
of
the
views
of
the
foreigners
or
else
it
should
cease
putting
forth
foreigner's
views
as
part
of
the
reason
of
basis
of
its
decisions.
to
invoke
alien
law
when
it
agrees
with
the
one's
own
thinking
and
ignored
otherwise
is
not
reasoned
decision
making.
finally,
to
add
insult
to
injury
the
court
affirms
today
the
missouri
supreme
court
without
even
admonishing
that
court
for
its
flagrant
disregard
of
our
president
in
stanford.
one
must
admit
that
the
missouri
supreme
court's
action
and
this
courts
indulgent
reaction
are
in
a
way
understandable.
the
court
has
reported
to
make
the
eighth
amendment
a
mirror
of
the
passing
and
changing
sentiment
of
american
society
regarding
penology,
state
courts
and
the
lower
federal
courts
can
look
into
that
mirror
as
well
as
we
can.
and
what
we
saw
off
15
years
ago
pairs
no
necessary
relationship
to
what
they
see
today.
so
they
should
really
not
be
encumbered
by
our
last
holding.
however,
sounds
that
is
philosophically
however
it
is
no
way
to
run
a
legal
system.
we
must
pretend
that
our
eighth
amendment
decisions
represent
the
real
law,
law
of
the
sort
that
does
not
change
year
to
year
without
the
benefit
of
any
change
in
democratically
adopted
text.
allowing
state
courts
and
lower
federal
courts
to
reinterpret
the
eighth
amendment
whenever
they
decide
enough
time
has
passed
for
new
snapshot
leaves
this
court's
decisions
without
any
force.
to
allow
all
courts
to
be
habeas
we
do
updating
the
eighth
amendment
as
needed
makes
our
case
law
and
unreliable
basis
for
the
designing
of
laws
by
citizens
and
their
representatives
and
for
action
by
public
officials.
the
results
will
be
to
crown
arbitrary
list
with
chaos.
