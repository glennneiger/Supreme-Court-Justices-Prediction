justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
were
in
the
midst
of
telling
us
why
the...
there
is
a
consensus
now
that
it's
inappropriate
to
execute
anyone
under
16,
and
i...
i...
you
weren't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
couldn't
finish
that
answer.
i
want
to
know
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
so
you
say
there's...
there's
not
so
much
as
a
consensus
as
an
understanding
of
what
that
decision
means.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let...
let
me
ask
you
this.
i...
i
don't
yet
have
the...
the
record
showing
the
full
closing
argument
of...
of
both
sides,
but
we
do
have
the
portion
where
the
prosecutor
says,
isn't
this
scary?
can
adolescence
ever
be
anything
but
mitigating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
how
the
prosecution
presented
it
to
the
jury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
said...
he...
he
almost
made
it
aggravating.
isn't
that
scary?
i
don't
have
the...
i
don't
have
the
full
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
somewhat--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let...
let's
focus
on
the
word
unusual.
forget
cruel
for
the
moment,
although
they're
both
obviously
involved.
we've
seen
very
substantial
demonstration
that
world
opinion
is...
is
against
this,
at
least
as
interpreted
by
the
leaders
of
the
european
union.
does
that
have
a
bearing
on
what's
unusual?
suppose
it
were
shown
that
the
united
states
were
one
of
the
very,
very
few
countries
that
executed
juveniles,
and
that's
true.
does
that
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
it's
unusual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
acknowledged
that
in...
in
my
question.
i
recognize
it
is
the
leadership
in
many
of
these
countries
that
objects
to
it.
but
let
us...
let
us
assume
that
it's
an
accepted
practice
in
most
countries
of
the
world
not
to
execute
a
juvenile
for
moral
reasons.
that
has
no
bearing
on
whether
or
not
what
we're
doing
is
unusual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we...
do
we
ever
take
the
position
that
what
we
do
here
should
influence
what
people
think
elsewhere?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
thought
that
mr.
jefferson
thought
that
what
we
did
here
had
no
bearing
on
the
rest
of
the
world?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
fact,
the
american
psychological
association
is
not
your
brief.
you're
not
accountable
for
inconsistencies
there.
but
i...
i
would
like
your
comment.
they
came
to
us
in
hodgson
v.
minnesota,
as
i
think
the
state
quite
correctly
points
out,
and
said
that
with
reference
to
the
age
for
determining
whether
the
child
could
have
an
abortion
without
parental
consent,
that
adults...
that
they...
that
they
were
risk...
that
they
could
assess
risk,
that
they
had
rational
capacity,
and
they
completely
flip-flop
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
just
because
of...
is
that
just
because
of
this
modern
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
surely
at
the
trial,
you
could
have
had
a
psychiatrist
testify
to
all
the
things
that
are
in
your...
in
your
brief,
and
in
fact
the...
it
would
be
another
argument,
but
maybe
the...
maybe
the
finding
was
deficient
on
that
ground
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
could
have
cited
all
the...
all
the
authorities
you
cite
in
your
brief.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
that
all
of
the
things
set
forth
in
your
brief
were
eloquently
set
forth
by
a
psychiatrist
to
the
jury.
could
the
jury
then
weigh
these
things
that
you're
telling
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
if
you're
reluctant
to
give
it
dispositive
weight
in
an
individual
case,
then
you
come
in
and
ask
us
to
give
it
dispositive
weight
as
a
general
rule,
that
seems
to
me
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose...
suppose
i...
i
were
not
convinced
about
your
scientific
evidence
was
conclusive
and
i
don't
identify
a
clear
consensus.
do
you
lose
the
case,
or
can
you
then
make
the
same
argument
you
just
made
appealing
to
some
other
more
fundamental
principle
that
stanford
was
just
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have...
i
have
one
other
question
i'd
like
to
ask
because
it's
been
troubling
me
and
i
want
your
comment.
a
number
of
juveniles
run
in
gangs
and
a
number
of
the
gang
members
are
over
18.
if
we
ruled
in
your
favor
and
this
decision
was
given
wide
publicity,
wouldn't
that
make
16-,
17-year-olds
subject
to
being
persuaded
to
be
the
hit
men
for
the
gangs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
i'm
very
concerned
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
deterrent
value
of
the
existing
rule
insofar
as
the
16
and
17-year-old.
if...
if
we
rule
against
you,
then
the
deterrent
remains.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
were
a
number...
a
number
of
cases
in
the
alabama
amicus
brief,
which
is
chilling
reading...
and
i
wish
that
all
the
people
that
sign
on
to
the
amicus
briefs
had
at
least
read
that
before
they
sign
on
to
them...
indicates
that
often
the
17-year-old
is
the
ringleader.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
present
case
involves
a
death
sentence
imposed
on
christopher
simmons
for
a
murder
he
committed
at
the
age
of
17
in
the
state
of
missouri.
along
with
another
juvenile
even
younger
than
he
was,
simmons
broke
into
the
home
of
a
lady
named
shirley
crook.
they
bound
and
gagged
her
using
the
ropes
and
duck
tape
and
then
drove
her
in
her
own
car
to
a
railroad
trestle
spanning
a
river.
simmons
and
his
accomplice
bound
mrs.
crook
more
security
and
threw
her
from
the
trestle
drowning
her
in
the
waters
below.
there
was
no
doubt
that
simmons
is
guilty
of
the
offense.
there
were
aggravating
factors
of
the
crime
making
it
heinous
and
cruel.
missouri
statute
has
three
separate
provisions
for
aggregation
all
of
which
the
jury
found
complied
within
the
sentencing
phase.
and
in
addition
to
the
cruel
manner
of
the
killing,
it
must
be
noted
that
simmons
planned
it
in
advanced.
he
told
his
friend
one
who
became
the
accomplice
that
they
could
get
away
with
it
because
they
were
minors.
and
even
as
the
family
was
learning
mrs.
crook
had
been
murdered,
simmons
was
bragging
about
the
crime.
a
decade-and-a-half
ago
in
1989
the
court
held
in
stanford
versus
kentucky
that
the
constitution
allows
states
to
impose
the
death
penalty
on
an
offender
who
is
16
or
17
years
old
when
he
committed
the
crime.
in
today's
case
simmons
argues
that
we
should
depart
from
stanford
despite
its
recent
date
just
as
we
have
departed
from
an
earlier
rule
regarding
execution
of
a
mentally
retarded.
three
terms
ago
in
atkins
versus
virginia
we
announced
the
categorical
rule
prohibiting
the
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded
overruling
the
earlier
case
or
departing
from
an
earlier
case.
simmons
says
we
should
announce
a
similar
categorical
rule
prohibiting
the
execution
of
juveniles.
the
missouri
supreme
court
agreed
with
simmons
on
that
proposition
and
set
aside
his
the
death
sentence
and
we
now
review
that
decision.
the
eight
amendment
which
applies
to
the
states
via
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
in
the
interpretation
of
its
terms
we
have
established
the
propriety
and
affirm
the
necessity
of
referring
to
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
that
mark
the
progress
of
a
maturing
society.
in
the
atkins
case
we
held
that
our
evolving
standards
of
decency
now
require
a
categorical
rule
against
executing
the
mentally
retarded.
as
in
atkins
in
today's
case
our
examination
of
the
evolving
standards
of
decency
proceeds
in
two
steps:
first
we
examine
the
first
objective
indicia
of
consensus;
second,
we
then
must
determine
in
the
exercise
of
our
own
independent
judgment
whether
the
death
penalty
is
a
disproportionate
punishment
for
juveniles.
as
to
objective
indicia
significant
parallels
exist
between
atkins
and
this
case.
30
states
prohibit
the
juvenile
death
penalty,
and
now
these
comprises
12
states
that
rejected
the
death
penalty
all
together
and
18
states
that
maintained
by
express
provision
or
by
judicial
interpretation
exclude
juvenile
from
its
reach.
even
in
the
20
states
without
a
formal
prohibition
on
executing
juveniles
the
practice
is
infrequent.
since
stanford
six
states
have
executed
the
prisoners
for
crime
committed
as
juveniles
and
in
the
past
10
years
only
three
have
done
so.
the
death
sentence
of
the
particular
name
defendant
in
the
stanford
case
was
itself
commuted
by
the
state.
so
even
he
was
not
executed.
five
states
have
abandoned
the
juvenile
death
penalty
since
stanford
and
no
state
has
lowered
the
minimum
age
for
capital
punishment.
as
in
atkins
the
objective
indicia
of
consensus
in
this
case
the
rejection
of
the
juvenile
death
penalty
in
the
majority
of
states,
the
infrequency
of
its
use
even
where
it
remains
on
the
books
and
the
consistency
in
the
trend
toward
abolition
of
the
practice,
provide
sufficient
evidence
that
today
our
society
views
juveniles
as
categorically
less
capable
than
the
average
criminal.
majority
of
states
have
rejected
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
the
juvenile
offenders
under
18
and
accord
with
that
view
we
now
hold
that
consistent
with
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
the
death
penalty
may
not
be
imposed
on
offenders
who
were
under
18
when
they
committed
the
crime.
three
general
difference
between
juveniles
and
adult
offenders
diminished
the
capability
of
juveniles:
first,
the
susceptibility
of
juveniles
to
immature
and
irresponsible
behavior
means
their
wrongful
conduct
is
not
as
morally
reprehensible
as
that
of
an
adult;
second
juveniles
compared
to
vulnerability
and
lack
of
control
over
immediate
surroundings,
i
mean
they
have
a
greater
claim
than
adults
to
be
forgiven
for
failing
to
escape
negative
influences;
third
the
realities
that
juveniles
still
struggled
to
define
their
identity
means
that
it
is
less
supportable
to
conclude
that
even
a
heinous
crime
committed
by
a
juvenile
is
evidenced
of
an
irretrievably
deprived
character.
from
a
moral
standpoint
it
would
be
misguided
to
equate
the
failings
of
a
minor
with
those
of
an
adult.
that
is
because
a
greater
possibility
exist
that
a
minors
character
deficiencies
will
be
reformed.
once
the
diminished
to
pass
the
juvenile
has
recognize
it
is
evident
the
penological
justification
of
the
death
penalty
applied
to
them
with
lesser
force
than
to
adults.
retribution
is
not
proportional.
if
the
laws
most
severe
penalty
is
imposed
on
one
whose
capability
or
blame
worthiness
is
diminished
to
a
substantial
degree
by
reason
on
youth
and
immaturity.
for
these
and
other
reasons
discussed
in
our
opinion
we
conclude
that
the
differences
between
a
juvenile
and
an
adult
offenders
are
too
marked
and
well
understood
to
risk
allowing
the
youthful
person
to
receive
the
death
penalty
despite
insufficient
capability.
despite
diagnostic
expertise
trained
psychiatrist
with
the
advantage
of
clinical
testing
and
observation
refrain
from
assessing
any
juvenile
under
18
as
having
an
antisocial
personality
disorder.
we
conclude
that
state
should
refrain
from
asking
jurors
to
issue
a
far
graver
condemnation
that
a
juvenile
offender
merits
the
death
penalty.
when
a
juvenile
offender
commits
a
heinous
crime,
the
state
can
exact
forfeiture
of
some
of
the
most
basic
liberties
but
the
state
cannot
extinguish
his
life
and
his
potential
to
attain
a
mature
understanding
of
his
own
humanity.
drawing
a
line
at
18
years
of
age
is
subject
of
course
to
the
objection
always
raised
against
categorical
rules.
the
qualities
that
distinguished
juveniles
from
adults
do
not
disappear
when
an
individual
turns
18,
by
the
same
token,
some
under
18
have
already
attained
a
level
of
maturity
some
of
adults
will
never
reach.
for
the
reasons
we
have
discussed
however
a
line
must
be
drawn,
and
these
consideration
mean
stanford
versus
kentucky
should
be
no
longer
controling
on
this
issue.
our
determination
that
the
death
penalty
is
disproportionate
punishment
for
offenders
under
18
finds
confirmation
and
the
stark
reality
that
the
united
states
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
continues
to
give
official
sanction
to
the
juvenile
death
penalty.
since
1990
only
7
countries
other
than
the
united
states
have
executed
juvenile
offenders
iran,
pakistan,
saudi
arabia,
yemen,
nigeria,
the
democratic
republic
of
congo,
and
the
people's
republic
of
china.
since
then
each
of
these
countries
has
either
abolished
capital
punishment
for
juveniles
or
made
public
disavowal
of
the
practice.
it
is
fair
to
say
the
united
states
now
stands
alone
in
the
world
that
has
turned
its
face
against
the
juvenile
death
penalty.
it
is
proper
that
we
acknowledge
the
overwhelming
weight
of
international
opinion
against
the
juvenile
death
penalty
resting
in
large
part
on
the
understanding
that
instability
and
emotional
imbalance
of
young
people
may
often
be
a
factor
in
the
crime.
at
least
from
the
time
of
the
court's
decision
in
troupe
versus
dallas
which
was
in
1958,
the
court
has
referred
to
the
laws
of
other
countries
and
to
international
authorities
as
instructive
for
its
interpretation
of
the
eighth
amendment
provision
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishments.
the
opinion
of
the
world
community
while
not
control
in
our
outcome
does
provide
respected
and
significant
confirmation
for
our
own
conclusions.
over
time
from
one
generation
to
the
next
the
constitution
has
come
to
earn
a
high
respect
and
even
as
madison
dared
to
hope,
the
veneration
of
the
american
people.
the
document
set
forth
and
rest
upon
innovative
principles
original
to
the
american
experience
such
as
federalism,
a
proven
balance
and
political
mechanisms
to
the
separation
of
powers
for
specific
guarantees
for
the
accused
and
criminal
cases
and
broad
provisions
to
secure
individuals
freedom
and
preserve
human
dignity.
these
doctrines
and
guarantees
are
central
to
the
american
experience
and
remain
essential
to
our
present
day
self
definition
in
our
national
identity.
not
the
least
of
the
reasons
we
now
honor
the
constitutionm
then,
is
because
we
know
it
to
be
our
own.
it
does
not
lessen
our
fidelity
to
the
constitution
or
our
pride
in
its
origins
to
acknowledge
that
the
express
affirmation
of
certain
fundamental
rights
by
other
nations
and
people
simply
underscores
the
centrality
of
those
same
rights
within
their
own
heritage
of
freedom.
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
forbid
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
on
offenders
who
are
under
the
age
of
18
when
their
crimes
were
committed.
the
judgment
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
setting
aside
the
sentence
of
death
imposed
upon
christopher
simmons
is
affirmed.
