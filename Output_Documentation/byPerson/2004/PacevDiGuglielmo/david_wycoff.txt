mr.
david
wycoff
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
pace,
at
age
17,
was
sentenced
to
life
without
possibility
of
parole
after
being
misled
by
his
lawyer
and
the
court.
his
right
to
federal
habeas
review
depends
entirely
upon
whether
his
state
post-conviction
proceedings
tolled
the
aedpa
statute
of
limitations.
this
court
should--
mr.
david
wycoff
--on
different
claims,
your
honor.
he
had
a
first,
a...
under
what
was
called
the
pcha
in
pennsylvania.
the
tolling
question
here
is
whether
the
pcra
petition--
mr.
david
wycoff
--he
raised
it
in
the
first
proceeding
an
ineffective--
mr.
david
wycoff
--assistance
of
counsel
claim--
mr.
david
wycoff
--related
to
that
and
some
other
claims
related
to
that--
mr.
david
wycoff
--in
the
second
proceeding.
mr.
david
wycoff
no,
your
honor.
he
actually...
the
first
petition
raised
only
an
ineffectiveness
claim.
the
second
petition
raised
a
due
process
challenge
to
the
colloquy,
which
was
not
exhausted
in
the
first,
raised
new
evidence
to
support
the
claim
which
pennsylvania
law
allowed
him
to
do,
and
raised
a
constitutional
and
state
law
challenge
to
the
legality
of
his
sentence.
there
were
new
claims
in
the
second
proceeding.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
that
his
lawyer
misled
him
was
the
first
claim,
that
by
telling
him
he'd
be
out
in
10
to
15
years.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
in...
in
the
second
he
raised
that
plus
that
the
colloquy
itself
was
defective
and
that
the
sentence,
the
life
without
parole
sentence,
was
illegal
and
unconstitutional,
apart
from
the
misinformation
aspect.
so
they
were
different
claims.
let
me
start
with
statutory
tolling.
section
2244(d)(2)
of
aedpa
provides
tolling
during
properly
filed
applications
for
state
post-conviction
review.
under
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
artuz,
mr.
pace's
pcra
petition
was
properly
filed.
in
fact,
the
pcra
time
bar
functions
in
all
material
ways
like
the
new
york
state
procedural
bar
rules
at
issue
in
artuz.
now,
artuz
also
identified
some
types
of
rules
that
would
prevent
an
application
from
being
properly
filed,
for
example,
the
aedpa
successive
bar
which
makes
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
first
and
get
permission
before
you
can
actually
file
in
the
district
court,
and
it
has
a
screening
mechanism
to
make
sure
that
only
petitions
with
a
prima
facie
chance
get
filed.
the
pcra
time
bar
is
nothing
like
that
at
all.
it's
like
the
state
court
procedural
bar
rules
in
artuz.
there's
no
condition
to
filing.
you
can
go
and
file
at
any
time.
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
law,
has
to
take
your
petition,
has
to
give
it
judicial
review...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
yes.
this...
artuz
said
that
a
time
limit
without
exception,
say,
in
30
days
you
must
file
in
30
days,
no
exception,
or
in
1
year,
no
exceptions...
that's
what
artuz
called
a
condition
to
filing
and
that
you're
either
in
or
you're
out
in
that
rule.
and
artuz,
though,
reserved
the
question
presented
here
of
whether
a
time
bar
with
exceptions,
like
the
pcra
time
bar...
whether
that
could
be
properly
filed.
and
so
obviously,
artuz
reserved
the
exact
question
here.
but
what...
the
analysis
of
artuz
controls
here
and
shows
that
this
petition
was
properly
filed.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
they're
similar
to
the
aedpa
exceptions.
mr.
david
wycoff
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
in...
in
terms
of
mr.
pace,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
said
it
wasn't
at
all
clear
before,
roughly,
december
of
1999
that
you
actually
need
to
plead
those
exceptions
in
your
petition.
now
they
say
you
should
plead
them
in
your
petition,
but
at
the
time
it
wasn't
clear.
certainly
the...
the
form
that
the
prison
provides--
mr.
david
wycoff
--if...
in
terms
of...
to
go
to
artuz'
analysis,
you
would
have
to
look
at
each...
the
exceptions
are...
go
claim
by
claim.
you
would
have
to
look
at
each
claim
and
see
did
you
plead
the
exception
for
this
claim,
yes
or
no;
this
claim,
yes
or
no.
so
again--
mr.
david
wycoff
--in
that
case--
mr.
david
wycoff
--because
the
court
still
accepts
it,
reviews
it
to
see
if
any
of
the
exceptions
apply.
mr.
david
wycoff
and...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
wycoff
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it's
not
that...
that
theory
at
all.
in...
in
pennsylvania,
the
court
accepts
it
and
gives
it
judicial
review
and
reviews
it
claim
by
claim
to
see
if
any
of
the
exceptions
apply.
mr.
david
wycoff
well,
that's
what
the
court
would
determine.
and
presumably
in
a
case
like
that,
the
court
would
be
able
to
dispose
of
it
quickly
and--
mr.
david
wycoff
--the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
now
has
said
you
should
plead
in
the
pcra
petition
the
exceptions.
mr.
david
wycoff
for
each...
any
claim
that
you're
raising,
yes.
it
goes
claim
by
claim.
mr.
david
wycoff
it...
it
can
arise
again,
your
honor,
and
that--
mr.
david
wycoff
--yes,
it
can
arise
again
and...
and
will
many
times
arise
again
because
consider
someone
who's
already
had
his
or
her
aedpa
year
pass
and
then
discovers,
say,
a
brady
claim
and
wants
to
go
back
and
litigate
that.
under
aedpa,
you
would
have
a
year
to
get
back
into
court
with
that.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes.
mr.
david
wycoff
that's...
yes,
but
under
state
law,
you
only
have
60
days
to
get
that.
so
someone
in
pennsylvania
who
finds
a
brady
claim,
say,
has
to
get
back
into
state
court
within
60
days
of
discovering
that.
so
his...
he...
he
could
go
into
state
court--
mr.
david
wycoff
--yes.
mr.
david
wycoff
or
he
finds
it
in
what
he
thinks
is
within
60
days
of
when
he
should
have
found
it.
he
files
his
state
post-conviction
application.
after
years
of
litigation,
the
court
says,
you
know,
you
really
should
have
found
it
59
days
ago,
not
60.
mr.
david
wycoff
it...
it
depends
on
if
there's
a
new...
if...
if
there
has
not
been
a
new
triggering
date,
other
than
the
finality
for
the
aedpa
date,
then
you
will
be
out
of
time
for
aedpa.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes.
and
in
fact,
everyone
now
who
has,
say,
a
brady
claim
is
going
to
have...
under
third
circuit
law
as
it
is
now,
is
going
to
have
to
come
into
federal
court
and
file
a
protective
habeas
petition
because
the
odds
are
very
likely
that
more
than
a...
the
aedpa
year
is
going
to
run
while
they
litigate
this.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes.
mr.
david
wycoff
well,
pennsylvania
actually
does
that
and
certainly
did
it
at
the
time
mr.
pace
was
litigating.
mr.
david
wycoff
they
have
said
now
you
should
plead
them
at
the
petition...
in
the
petition.
mr.
david
wycoff
i--
mr.
david
wycoff
--i...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
know
that
was
the
practice.
in...
in
fact,
pennsylvania
courts
still
do
that.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
while
you're...
and
the
state
could
easily
prevent
that
by
setting
up
some
kind
of
prefiling
requirement
for--
mr.
david
wycoff
--the...
the
question
of
whether
it
was
timely
or
not
is
not
actually
determined
until
the
end
of
the
litigation.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
your
honor,
and
exactly
the
same
could
be
said
about
artuz,
the
procedural
bar
rules
in
artuz,
whether
someone
pled--
mr.
david
wycoff
--because
the
state
court
lets
you
file
it
and
gives
it
judicial
review
and
applies
it
claim
by
claim.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes,
your
honor.
and
it's...
it's
connected
to
the
statutory
language.
aedpa
says
we'll
toll
for
properly
filed
applications.
that...
aedpa
is
keyed
to
how
much
process
the
state
post-conviction
courts
will
give
you.
in
a...
in
a
state
where
they
say
anyone
who
comes
after
a
year,
we
won't
give
you
any
review
and
you're
just
out
of
court,
aedpa
says
when...
that's
not...
we're
not
going
to
consider
that
properly
filed.
we
won't
toll,
but--
mr.
david
wycoff
--well--
mr.
david
wycoff
--okay,
and
that
was
what
i
was
tempted
to
answer,
and
since
you
said
it,
i'll
go
straight
to
the
death
cases.
in
pennsylvania,
certainly
there's
no...
a
death-sentence
prisoner
can
get
nowhere
by
filing
what
he
knows
to
be
an
untimely
pcra
petition
because
pennsylvania
law
requires
the
governor
to
sign
warrants
when
the
conviction
is
final
and
then
at
every
break
in
the
litigation
basically
after
that.
and
the
pcra
courts
cannot
grant
a
stay
of
execution
until
after
they
find
that
the
petition
is
both
timely
and
meritorious.
so
it's
not--
mr.
david
wycoff
--that's
true.
and
i
mean,
each
state
can
set
up
a
system
to...
to
satisfy
its
needs.
pennsylvania
could
set
up
a
system
like
the
aedpa
successor
bar
to
say
you're
not
going
to
be
filed
at
all
until
we
give
you
permission.
mr.
david
wycoff
well,
i
think
all
the
courts
of
appeal
that
have...
have
talked
about
that
have
thought...
have
said
that
you
really
shouldn't
start
figuring
out
whether
it
was
a
frivolous
assertion
or
meritorious--
mr.
david
wycoff
--presumably
you
could
and
if
there's
someone
who
wants
to
do
that,
which
is
going
to
be
a
rare--
mr.
david
wycoff
--i
think
that
going
down
that
path
is
going
to
open
up
just
a
nightmare
of...
of
litigation
in
federal
court
about...
if
you
start
talking
about
good
faith
and
are
you...
if
the
state
courts
deny
it,
can
you
still
say
it
was
nonfrivolous?
i
think
all
the
courts
just
across
the
board
have
tried
to
avoid
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
david
wycoff
two...
i
have
two
things
to
say
about
that.
one
is
it
creates
a
problem
with
artuz
because
that
type
of
rule...
assuming
the
exceptions
are
like
the
pcra
exceptions
which
go
claim
by
claim,
that's
a
claim-by-claim
rule
which
would
then
create
the
anomaly
that
artuz
shied
away
from,
that
you
look
to
whether
it
was
a
properly
filed
application,
not
to
whether
it
was
an
application
with
properly
filed
claims.
the
second
point
is
that...
is
that
for
mr.
pace,
whatever
the
merits
of
that
rule
may
be
going
forward,
it...
it
can't
be
used
against
mr.
pace
because
there
was
no
such
requirement
in
pennsylvania.
i
mean,
presumably
the...
i
assume
the
federal
courts
are
not
going
to
make
up
this
rule,
that
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
state
courts
to
say
what
their
filing--
mr.
david
wycoff
--well,
artuz
talks
about
you
look
to
the
state's
procedural
filing
requirements.
this
is
a
federal
statute
and
properly
filed
is
given
a
federal
meaning,
but
you
presumably
look
to
the
state
filing
requirements,
as
you
did
in
artuz,
to
determine
what
that
means.
now,
all
of
these
concerns
about
delay
and
so
on
are
the
exact
same
concerns,
where
there
in
artuz
someone
could
file
successive
petition
after
successive
petition
in
new
york
if
they
want
to
delay.
it's
just
not...
it's
not
a...
it's
certainly
not
a
problem
for
noncapital
cases.
mr.
david
wycoff
yes.
mr.
david
wycoff
i'm
not...
i'm
saying
aedpa
says
come
to
federal
court
within
a
year.
we'll
toll
when
you're
in
state
court
if
it's
properly
filed.
properly
filed,
if
the
states
let
you
file
a
lot
of
stuff,
we're
going
to...
comity
requires
us
to
allow
that,
and
we'll
toll.
if
the
states
don't--
mr.
david
wycoff
--that's
one
way
or
a
prefiling
requirement.
mr.
david
wycoff
the
aedpa
prefiling
requirement
where
you
go
to
the
court
and
you
say,
i'd
like
to
file
this
petition,
tell
me
if
i
can,
and
the
court
says,
30
days
later,
yes
or
no.
that's--
mr.
david
wycoff
--well,
yes.
if...
the
aedpa--
mr.
david
wycoff
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
courts
are...
are...
the
federal
courts
are
capable
of
telling
the
difference
between
an
application
for
state
post-conviction
relief
on
the
one
hand
and
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
an
application
on
the
other
hand.
in
fact,
the
seventh
circuit
in...
in
the
smith
v.
walls
case
and
the
tinker
v.
ward
case
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
had
exactly
that
distinction
between
an
indiana
rule
which
had
a
prefiling
requirement
and
an
illinois
rule--
mr.
david
wycoff
--i
suppose
that...
i
mean,
that
could
be
a
construction
of
the
statute
as
long
as
you
let
people...
people
are
going
to
come
to
federal
court
first
and
get...
for
stay
abeyance
if
you
do
that.
if
you
don't
know
until
the
outcome
years
later
whether
you
were
tolling
or
not,
that's
going
to
cause
everyone
to
file
protective
filings.
mr.
david
wycoff
well,
i
was
just--
mr.
david
wycoff
--the--
mr.
david
wycoff
--the
problem
with
that
in
terms...
is
that
it
conflicts
with
artuz'
idea
that
the...
any
rule
that's
a
condition
to
filing
has
to
go
to
the
application
as
a
whole.
mr.
david
wycoff
just--
mr.
david
wycoff
--just
in
terms
of...
of
policy,
i
think
any
rule
you
adopt
that's
not
mechanical
and
doesn't
let
people
know
on
the
front
end
whether
they're
tolling
or
not,
there's
going
to
be
floods
of
protective
filings.
now,
the...
the
rule
like...
a
rule
which
is...
which...
where
they
know
going
in
and
whether
they're
going
to
be
tolled
or
not,
then
they
can
say
plead...
litigate
in
state
court
becoming...
before
coming
to
federal
court.
and
duncan
v.
walker
was
very
clear
that
the
court
doesn't
want
lots
of
people
filing
prematurely.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
equitable
tolling.
as
chief
district
judge
giles
found,
that
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
deprivation
of
rights
and
patently
unfair
to
deny
tolling
in
federal
review
here,
he
found...
judge
giles
found
that
if
mr.
pace
had
filed
a
federal
habeas
petition
instead
of
his
pcra
petition,
judge
giles
would
have
dismissed
it
and
required
him
to
do
exactly
what
he
did,
which
is
to
seek
state
remedies
under
the
pcra.
as
judge
giles
found,
mr.
pace
acted
diligently
and
appropriately
under
the
circumstances.
it
seems
this
is
a
clear
case
for
equitable
tolling.
this
is
a
case
where--
mr.
david
wycoff
--you're
talking
about
the
time
from
the
first
pcra--
mr.
david
wycoff
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
wycoff
i
have,
i
think,
four
responses
to
that.
first,
mr.
pace
was
not
sitting
on
his
hands
for
these
4
years.
this
is
a
man
who
entered
prison
at
age
17,
barely
educated,
barely
literate,
drug-addled.
this
is
not
someone
who
was
prepared
to
litigate
on
his
own
when
he
came
into
prison.
this
is
someone
who...
whose
legal
papers
were
destroyed
by
the
prison.
this
is
someone
who
was
without
counsel
for
that
entire
time
that
you're
talking
about.
this
is
someone
who
had
very
limited
access
to
a
law
library
throughout
that
time.
mr.
pace
spent
those
years
teaching
himself
how
to
do
law
which
he--
mr.
david
wycoff
--in
fact--
mr.
david
wycoff
--well,
in
fact,
that...
that
claim
was
litigated...
litigated
in
the
first
petition,
and
in
fact,
he
didn't
think
of
that.
if
you
look
at
his
pro
se
pcha
petition,
he
didn't
know
that
was
a
claim.
it's
a...
it's
a
form
that
he
filled
out
and
handed
in
and
appointed
counsel
came
up
with
that
claim
in
the
first
post-conviction
proceeding.
this
is
much
more
complex
than
that.
if
you
look
at
his
briefs,
which
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
pennsylvania
had
a
very
complex
system
of
law
here
where
they
had
statutory
bar
rules
but
they
had
judicial
exceptions
to
those
rules.
and
it's
not
an
easy
matter
for
someone
to
figure
that
out.
mr.
pace
educated
himself.
just
compare
the
pro
se
pleading
filed
in
1992
to
what
he
filed
in
1996,
and
you
can
see
what
he
did
during
these
4
years.
the
other...
the
other...
just...
my
light
is
on,
but
just
the
other
things
i'd
like
to
mention
about
that
are
that
keep
in
mind,
during
this
time
there
were
no
time
limits
on
filing
in
either
state
or
federal
court.
the
commonwealth
has
never
alleged
any
prejudice
from
this
time,
and
there's
never
been
any
allegation
that
mr.
pace
acted
in
bad
faith
and
with
any...
any
intent
to
delay.
in
fact,
this
is
someone
who
wanted
to
get
his
claims
heard,
wanted
to
figure
out
how
to
do
it
right,
and
did
figure
out
how
to
do
it
right
in
the
end.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
david
wycoff
thank
you.
mr.
david
wycoff
several
things.
first
of
all,
the
respondent
said
that
in
the
second
petition
mr.
pace
only
presented
state
law,
ineffective
assistance
of
post-conviction
claims,
which
are
not
federal
claims.
that's
absolutely
not
true.
he
presented
the
ineffective
assistance
of
post-conviction
counsel
as
a
waiver-overcoming
mechanism
not
as
a
substantive
claim
for
relief.
the
substantive
claims
were
due
process
claim,
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
new
facts
which
needed
to
be
exhausted
under
third
circuit
exhaustion
law.
second,
respondent
suggested
and...
and
the
third
circuit
also
suggested
that
state
law
somehow
became
clear
in
mid-december
1997
when
the
superior
court,
which
is
pennsylvania's
intermediate
court,
decided
a
case
called
alcorn.
alcorn
was
the
first
case
to
apply
the
time
bar.
but
the
third
circuit
itself,
after
alcorn
in
the
lambert
case,
held
that
the...
the
statutory
language
of
the
time
bar
is
not
dispositive
and
you
have
to
exhaust
even
if
you
don't
meet
one
of
the
statutory
exceptions
because
the
court
may
fashion
judicial
exceptions
just
like
they
did
for
all
the
other
procedural
bar
rules.
in
fact,
pennsylvania
in
the
lambert
case,
in
their
opposition
to
the
certiorari
petition
in
may
of
1998,
said
that
that's
a
correct
statement
of
pennsylvania
law,
that
there
are
judicially
created
exceptions,
including
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
which
will
probably
apply
to
the
time
bar,
just
like
they
applied
to
the
other
statutory
bars.
so
alcorn
did
not,
even
if
it
could
have,
since
it's
an
intermediate
court,
it
did
not
clear
up
the
state
of
the
law.
the
law
did
not
become
clear
as
to
the
specific
things
that
mr.
pace
alleged,
which
is
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
under
pennsylvania
law
and
the
illegal
sentence
exception,
judicially
created
exceptions
to
bar,
were
not
rejected
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
until
july
of...
i'm
sorry...
august
of
1999,
which
is...
by
that
time
mr.
pace
was
already
out
of
state
court
so
those...
the
law
became
clear
in
state
court
after
he
was
already
done
litigating.
the
third
circuit
did
not
actually
find
the
statutory
language
of
the
pcra
time
bar
dispositive
of
the
exhaustion
question
until
march
of
2000.
the
district
courts,
not
just
judge
giles,
chief
judge
giles'
20
years
experience
on
the
bench,
not
just
him,
lots
of
district
courts
send
people
back
to
exhaust
during
this
same
time
period.
state
law
was
unclear.
state
law
appeared
to
provide
remedies
and
possible
merits
review.
because
the
state
law
was
unclear,
third
circuit
exhaustion
law
required
petitioners
like
mr.
pace
to
go
back
and
exhaust.
and
he
did
exactly
what
the
circuit
law
required
of
him.
as
a
matter
of
equity,
the
court
cannot
punish
someone.
a
federal
court
can't
say,
do
x,
and
then
after
that
person
does
it,
say,
sorry,
you're
out
of
court.
it's
not
fair
and
it
shouldn't
happen
here.
as
to
statutory
tolling,
i
just
want
to...
the...
the
court
i
think
can
just
easily
decide
this
case
just
by
reaffirming
the
central
holding
of
artuz
which
is
when
a
state
court
allows
you
to
file,
gives
your
filing
judicial
review,
applies
a
bar
rule
on
a
claim-by-claim
basis,
that
was
a
condition
to
obtaining
relief
on
claims
in
the
petition.
it's
not
a
condition
to
filing
the
petition
itself.
and
if
the
state
court
eventually
holds
all
your
claims
are
barred,
as
they
did
in
artuz,
the
petition
is,
nevertheless,
properly
filed
and
should
toll
aedpa's
statutory...
under
aedpa's
statutory
tolling
provisions.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
