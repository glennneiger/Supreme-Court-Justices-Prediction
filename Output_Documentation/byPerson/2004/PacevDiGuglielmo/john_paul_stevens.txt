paul

we'll
hear
argument
in
pace
against
the...
the
warden.
mr.
wycoff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
eisenberg.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
how
you
would
handle
a
case
that
is
a
successive
petition,
a
late...
a
recently
found
claim,
and
the...
filed
beyond
the
statute
of
limitations
but
the
state
has
three
exceptions
to
the
statute,
but
it
does
not
require
that
the...
the
petitioner
identify
the
exception
in
the
petition?
it
just
allows
it
for
the
judge
to
decide.
would
there
be
tolling
during
the
period
in
which
the
judge
decided
whether
or
not
the
petition
was
timely
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
if
it
takes
a
year
or
so
to
make
that
decision,
you'd
say
no
tolling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
in
all
of
those
questions,
you'd
say
there
would
be
no
tolling
in
order
to
find
out
whether
it
was
timely
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
about
the
reasoning
in
artuz
that
the
application
was...
if
it
turns
out
later
it
was
timely,
it
would
have
been
properly
filed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
saying
that
even
if
it
takes
the
judge
6
months
to
decide
whether
it
was
timely,
if
he
ends
up
with
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
timely,
there
would
be
no
tolling
for
that
6-month
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
sa
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
the
transcript
of
the
plea
colloquy
still
available?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
there
the
constitutional
violation
he
alleges?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
irony
of
this
whole
proceeding
is
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
to
decide
the
merits
of
that
claim
if
the
transcript
is
available
than
to
get
into
all
these
issues--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
have
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
he's
a
17-year-old
without
any
learning
in
the
law.
he
probably
didn't
realize
there's
any
requirement
that
these
things
have
to
appear
in
the
transcript.
i
mean,
that's
understandable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
eisenberg.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wycoff,
you
have
about
4
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
wycoff.
the
case
is
submitted.
