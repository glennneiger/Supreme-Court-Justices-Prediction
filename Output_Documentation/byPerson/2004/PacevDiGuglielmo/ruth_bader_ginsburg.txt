justice
ruth
bader

--of
both
claims
was,
however
he
dressed
it
up
in...
in
due
process,
that
i
wasn't
told
at
the
time
of
my
sentencing
that
life
meant
life
without
parole.
that
was
the
essence,
the
core
of
his
complaint
the
first
time
around,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
but
the
essence
of
it
was
i
wasn't
told
that
life
meant
i
would
never
get
out
of
prison.
justice

both
times.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
wycoff,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
this...
that
artuz...
i
thought,
frankly,
that
artuz
had
classified
within
properly
filed
timely
filed
and
then
had
a
footnote,
and
it
says
that
there
might
be
some
exceptions
to
a
timely
filing
rule--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--rule.
and
they're
not
taking
a
position
about
that.
but
you
quickly
said
this
time
limitation
falls
under
the
procedural
bar
label.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
aedpa...
it
doesn't
say
1
year
and
that's
it.
aedpa
has
exceptions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's,
in...
in
effect,
saying
that
there
is
no...
that
the
properly
filed,
given
the
pennsylvania
procedure,
does
not
include
timely
filed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
you
have
just
said
that
the...
the
court
will
look
on
its
own
to
see
if
there
are
these
exceptions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
there
would
be
no
case
of
an
untimely
filing
in
this
period
when
the
court
was...
even
if
you
raised
no
exception,
was
going
through
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
would
be
no
case
in
which
an
untimely
filing
would
be
included
in
properly
filed
because
the
very
fact
that
the
court
itself
would
go
through
the
petition
to
look
for
exceptions
would
take
it
out
of
the
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
the
difference
was
that
artuz
ranked
timely
filing
as
an
ingredient
of
properly
filed,
and
you
say
but
not
in
pennsylvania
the
way
it's
set
up.
timely
filing
is
not
an
ingredient
of
properly
filed.
