justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't...
don't
you
have
a...
a...
sort
of
a
second
prong
to...
to
your
response?
and
i...
i
wanted
to
get
into
this.
you...
you
have
said
pennsylvania
will
let
you
file
even
though
ultimately
it,
you
know,
may
well
determine
that
you...
you
were
out
of
time
and
you
don't
fall
within
any
of
the
exceptions.
well,
that's...
that's
an
answer.
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
strong
enough
answer
to
respond
to
artuz.
but
i
thought
you
had
a
second
part
to
the
answer,
and
i
thought
your
second
part
to
the
answer
was
in
that
kind
of
situation,
the
third
circuit
practice,
the
third
circuit
rule
is
that
unless
we
go
through
the
pennsylvania
process,
even
if
we
know
from
day
one
that
we're
out
of
time,
we
think
we
have
a...
an
excuse,
but
even
though
we...
we
think
from
day
one
we're
out
of
time,
unless
we
exhaust
the
pennsylvania
process,
they
will
throw
us
out
for
nonexhaustion.
and
the
reason
they
will
throw
us
out
from
nonexhaustion,
as
opposed
to
going
directly
to
the
question
whether
there
is
an
excuse
for
nonexhaustion,
is
because
pennsylvania
will
actually
let
us
litigate
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
not
determine
it
as
a
threshold
matter.
so...
so
your
answer,
as
i
understand
it,
is
pennsylvania
let's
you
litigate
it,
and
the
third
circuit
requires
you
to
litigate
it
so
that
the
only
reasonable
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
litigate
it
even
if
you
may
say
in
the
abstract
it's
a
purely
threshold
time
question.
and
for
that
reason,
there
should
be
tolling.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
there
a
wrinkle
to
this?
isn't
the
wrinkle
that
even
in
cases
in
which
you
and
i
might
say
patently
he's
going
to
be
out
of
time
if
he
goes
back
to
federal
court,
the
third
circuit
is
requiring
him
to
go
there
anyway,
go
through
the
formality
of
formal
exhaustion,
if
you
will,
before
they'll
consider
it?
and
isn't
that
a
basis
at
least
for
equitable
tolling?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
help
me...
help
me
out
here
because
i...
i
just
don't
remember
well
enough.
i
thought
that's
what
judge
giles
was
getting
at
when
he
said,
you
know,
he
would
have
been
thrown
out
if
he
hadn't
gone
through
the
state
procedure.
so
help
me
out.
is
that
what
he
was
getting
at
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
means
the
petitioner
was
wrong,
doesn't
it
also
mean
that
judge
giles
is
wrong,
and
if
judge
giles
can't
figure
it
out,
isn't
there
a
pretty
good
argument
that
the
petitioner
ought
to
get
equitable
tolling?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
judge
giles
didn't
understand
it
either.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
yes.
and...
and
so
if
judge
giles
got
it
wrong,
isn't
there
a
pretty
good
argument
for
equitable
tolling
when
the
petitioner
gets
it
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
this
argument
is
not
trying
to
decide
for
the
states.
this
argument
basically
is
if
nobody
can
figure
it
out,
including
a
federal
district
judge,
at
least
give
me
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
with
equitable
tolling.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
he
had
gone
into
the
federal
court
he
went
into,
and
he
had
not
gone
through
this
state
procedure,
he
would
have
been
turfed
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
answer
that
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--before
you
tell
me
what
the
consequence
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
don't...
don't
we
have
to
take
judge
giles'
statement
as
being
a
statement
in
good
faith
unless
there
is
a
pretty
darned
good
reason
not
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
also
raised
an...
an
entirely
different
claim,
didn't
he?
i
mean,
it
goes
to
ultimately
the
same
point,
but
he
raised
the
claim
that
the
court
had
not
engaged
in
an
adequate
colloquy--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
but
that...
the...
i
mean,
it's
a
different
claim.
the
judge
has
an
independent
responsibility.
it's
not
the
lawyer's
responsibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
that
may
be,
but
it
is
a
different
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
is
not
the
claim
of
ineffective
assistance.
