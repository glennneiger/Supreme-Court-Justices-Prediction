day
o'connor
well,
he...
he
had
a
prior
round
of
hearings
at
the
state
level
on
these
same
claims,
did
he
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know,
but
the
substance
of
it,
saying
it
isn't
fair
to
give
me
life
without
parole
because
of
what
happened,
i
didn't
understand
the
plea...
he
raised
that
in
state
court
before.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he...
he
essentially
wants
to
relitigate
the
substance
of
those
previous
claims.
