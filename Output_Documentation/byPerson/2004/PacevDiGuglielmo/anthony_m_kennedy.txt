justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
does
the
pennsylvania
court...
law
now
say
with
respect
to
claim-by-claim
pleading
of
the
exceptions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
claim
by
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
we
would
have
to
breathe
life
back
into
the
stay
and
abey--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
let
me
ask
you
this.
returning
to
our
earlier
discussion
about
pleading
a
specific
exemption--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
states,
do
you
know,
where
that
is
not
required
and
the
state
court
will
go
through
the
exceptions
even
if
you
haven't
pled
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
thought
you
said
pennsylvania
law
had
changed
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my...
my
question
is
do
you
know
if
there
are
other
states
where
they
say,
we
don't
care
if
you
plead
these--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--exemptions
specifically
or
not?
we're
going
to
look
through
it
and
find
it
for
ourselves.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
if
you're
tempted
to
answer,
well,
people
want
to
get
out
so
they're
not
going
to
sit
around
forever,
then
we'd
ask
you
what
about
the
death
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
would
apply
to
other
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
rule
that
filing
is
sufficient,
are
there
any
instances
of...
of
frivolous
petition
where
your
rule
would
not
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
justice
scalia's
prediction
is...
is
right.
you
just
keep
filing
and
filing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
if
it
takes
a
year
a
later,
then
we--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then
you
just
repeat
the
process
one
step
backward.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
we
accept
your
position,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
prisoners
are
going
to
have
to
go
once
to
federal
court
and
then
they're...
they're
going
to
run
into
an
exhaustion
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we're
assuming
a
late-discovered
claim
that's
within
aedpa.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
i
do
it
in
a
state
where
there
is
a
plausible
close
question
of
whether
or
not
the
successive
petition
is
barred
in
the
state
court?
and
i
interrupted
justice
breyer,
but
i...
i
think
it's
along
the
same
line.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
no...
there's
still
an
exhaustion
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems...
it
seems
intuitive
also
that
the
prosecution's
witnesses
will
be
difficult
to
locate
and
so
forth.
has...
has
there
been
anything
written
about
that,
about
prejudice
to
the
prosecution
from...
from
delay,
or
is
it
just
something
we--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
take
judicial
notice
of?
