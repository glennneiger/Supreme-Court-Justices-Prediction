mr.
ronald
eisenberg
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
the
structure
of
the
pennsylvania
filing
deadlines
for
post-conviction
review
because
i
think
they
shed
some
light
and
need
some
discussion
here.
what
pennsylvania
did
was
to
establish
a
1-year,
flat
time
limit
that
applies
to
everybody.
1
year
from
conviction.
it's
automatic.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
nature
of
your
claims
are.
it
doesn't
matter
when
you
discovered
your
claim.
in
order
to
comply
with
that
time
limit,
all
you
have
to
do
is
file
a
post-conviction
petition
within
1
year
of
finality.
the
rest
of
the
statute
is
essentially
a
separate
set
of
filing
deadlines
for
petitioners,
for
successive
petitioners,
for
people
who
either
have
already
had
one
round
of
post-conviction
review
or
who
haven't
bothered
to
pursue
it.
those
people,
said
the
legislature,
are
only
going
to
be
entitled
to
further
post-conviction
review,
to
additional
rounds
of
post-conviction
review
if
they
fall
into
a
particular
class
of
claim
that
couldn't
have
been
raised
earlier.
and...
and
the
legislature
identified
three
classes
that
mirror
the
three
provisions
in
the
federal
statute
of
limitations.
and
if
the
petitioner
falls
within
any
of
those
classes,
he
then
has
60
days
from
the
time
that
that
claim
arose
in
order
to
come
into
court.
now,
if
a
petitioner
files
a
post-conviction
petition
and
he's
within
a
year
of
finality,
those
so-called
exceptions
don't
come
into
play.
they
don't
apply.
he
doesn't
need
to
meet
them.
those
are
for
the
second
petitioner.
so
what
pennsylvania
really
has
is
a
two-level
system
of
statutes
of...
of
filing
limitations.
and
of
course,
in
order
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
petitioner
has
met
the
filing
deadline,
he
has
to
look
at
these
three
classes
for
someone
who
has
passed
1
year
from
finality.
that's
not
an
exception
in
the
way
i
think
that
the
petitioner
and
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
used
the
term
at
all.
these
are
simply
different
kinds
of
filing
limits.
and
of
course,
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
statute
and
the
nature
of
the
claims
to
see
whether
review
is
available
and
to
see
whether
the
petitioner
has
sought
review
within
the
proper
time.
nothing
about
that
system
makes
those
so-called
exceptions
not
time
limits.
they're
still
time
limits,
and
if
you
don't
file
in
time
and
come
within
one
of
those
classes,
then
the
second
petition,
successive
petition
time
limits
don't
apply
to
you
and
you're
out
of
time.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
they're
not
going
to
run
into
an
exhaustion
requirement,
your
honor,
because
if
they've
already
been
through
one
round
of
state
post-conviction
review,
then
they
are
unlikely
to
be
able
to
exhaust
more
claims
because
there's
a...
there's
a--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--1-year
time
limit.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
that's
right.
and
so
the
question
is
whether...
and
what
petitioner
is
really
saying
is
that
the
aedpa
1-year
time
limit
should
be
suspended
essentially
indefinitely
as
long
as
the
petitioner
wants
to
argue
that
he
may
have
some
late-discovered
claim
in
state
court.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
it's...
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
and...
and
the
reason
that
it's
not--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--only...
it's...
that
is
true
only
for
successive
petitioners.
for
people
who
aren't
satisfied
with
the
round
of
direct
appeal
and
a
round
of
first...
of
post-conviction
review
in
state
court.
and
so
the
question
is
whether
the
federal
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
essentially
writes
off
the
state's
time
requirements
for
the
successive
petitioner
so
that
we
can
make
sure
that
the
successive
petitioner
can
exhaust
whatever
new
claims
he
wants
to
come
up
with
in
state
court
before
he
comes
to
federal
circuit.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
the...
the
general
rule...
and
this
is
implicit
i
think
in
the
fact
that
congress
passed
a
statute
of
limitations.
the
general
rule
is
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
whatever
he
automatically
gets
in
state
court
in
order
to
exhaust
a
universe
of
claims,
not
all
possible
claims,
but
whatever
claims
can
be
exhausted
within
those
guaranteed
rounds
of
review.
at
that
point,
he
should
go
to
federal
court.
if
new
claims
arise
after
that,
then
congress
specifically
provided
for
them
in
the
second
and
successive
petition
procedure
that
it
has
in
the
federal
statute.
the
way
that
would
interact--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--the
way
that
would
interact
with...
for
exhaustion
purposes
with
a
state
like
pennsylvania
is
this.
the
petitioner
finishes
his
direct
review.
he
finishes
his
post-conviction
review.
he
has
a
set
of
clearly
exhausted
claims.
he
files
a
fully
exhausted
petition
in
federal
court.
no
rose
v.
lundy
problem.
if
a
new
claim
arises
at
that
point,
then
he
has
to
go
to
state
court
and
try
to
exhaust
that
claim
in
state
court.
he
can
do
that
while
a
federal
petition
is
pending
or
even
after
a
first
federal
petition
has
already
been
disposed
of.
in
fact,
he
may
have
to
because
the
claim
may
not
arise
before
the
end
of
litigation
in
federal
court.
when
he
gets
to
state
court,
he's
either
going
to
be
deemed
timely
or
not.
actually
the
fact
that
we
have
a
60-day
time
limit
as
opposed
to
a
whole
year
helps
him
because
it
helps
make
it
clear
to
him
that
he's
got
to
come
to
state
court
at
a
point
where
he's
really
got
a
long
time
left
to
deal
with
federal
court
because
he's
going
to--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--with
respect
to
your
argument,
the
answer
is
absolutely
not.
first
of
all,
as
you
have
just
observed,
that's
really
an
argument
that
goes
to
equitable
tolling.
even
petitioner
doesn't
bring
in
the
third
circuit
law
with
respect
to
statutory
tolling,
with
respect
to
understanding
the...
the
language
of
the
statute.
as
to
equitable
tolling,
however,
the
factual
premise
is
wrong.
it's
not
true
that
the
third
circuit
forces
the
defendant
to
go
back
to
state
court
no
matter
what.
in
fact--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--that
is
what
he
was
getting
at
but
at
a
limited
point
in
time,
and
the
whole
question
for
equitable
tolling
purposes
was
at
what
point
in
time.
nobody
argues
that
the
third
circuit
still
is
making
everybody
go
back
and
do
it
no
matter
what.
what
the
petitioner
argued
was
that
the
third
circuit
case
law,
as
of
1997
when
he
was
first
starting
his
second
round
of
post-conviction
review
in
state
court,
as
of
that
time,
he
says,
the
third
circuit
case
law
said
you
have
to
go
back
no
matter
what
even
though
pennsylvania
has
a...
this
new
statute
of
limitations.
that's
not
what
the
third
circuit
says,
though.
and
all
the
cases
that
the
petitioner
relies
on
primarily...
he
cites
a...
a
case
called
doctor,
a
case
called
banks,
a
case
called
lambert.
all
of
those
cases
were
decided
before
the
pennsylvania
courts
began
applying
the
new
jurisdictional
time
bar
in
state
court.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
there
are
a
number
of
problems
with
the
equitable
tolling,
your
honor.
but
even
taking
that
main
one,
that
the
petitioner
made
a
mistake
of
law,
that
he
didn't
figure
out
correctly
whether
he
was
supposed
to
go
back
to
state
court,
even
on
that
point,
your
honor,
that's
not
grounds
for
equitable
tolling.
you
take
a
risk
when
you
make
a
legal
argument
that
it
will
fail.
this
legal
argument
was
controlled
entirely
by
state
law,
and
what
the
third
circuit,
as
opposed
to
judge
giles
who
was
reversed
by
the
third
circuit
said,
is
that
you
have
to
look
back
to
state
law.
what
the
third
circuit
has
said...
and
the...
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
49
is
walker
v.
frank.
chief
judge
becker
said
no,
we're
not
going
to
give
equitable
tolling
to
these
defendants
because
at
the
very
latest...
at
the
very
latest...
they
had
to
know
by
december
of
1997
that
they
were
going
to
be
time-barred
in
state
court.
this
petitioner
filed--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--judge
giles
didn't
say
that...
that
the
state
law
would
never
in
the
future
be
applied
to
these
defendants.
he
said
at
this
early
time
it
was
still
unclear
whether
it
would
be
applied.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
what
there
is
is
an
argument
that
he
had
an
argument
to
make
in
federal
court
that
he
was
not...
that
he
was
still
going
to
have
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to
state
court.
but
the
problem
is
that
federal
courts
can't
decide
for
the
states
how
their
time
bars
are
going
to
be
applied.
and
if
instead
they
said--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--it's
not
true
that
nobody
could
figure
it
out,
your
honor.
in
fact,
all
the
cases
that
the
petitioner
cites
in
his
brief
from
federal
district
court
judges
who
were
sending
defendants
back
to
state
court
during
this
period
because
they
said,
well,
maybe
you'll
get
exhaustion
anyway,
maybe
you'll
be
able
to
exhaust
claims,
of
those
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
brief,
most
of
them
are
from
the
same
one
judge
who
kept
saying
the
same
thing
over
and
over.
several
of
the
other
cases
didn't
even
talk
about
the
state
time
bar,
and
at
that
same
period
of
time,
there
were
other
district
judges
who
weren't
sending
defendants
back,
who
were
saying
there's
a
new
state
time
bar,
you're
barred
in
state
court,
and
therefore,
if
you
want
to
raise
this
claim
in
federal
court,
you
can,
but
you
face
procedural
default.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
you
can't
get
equitable
tolling,
your
honor,
our
position
would
be--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
no.
that's
what
judge
giles
said
many
years
after
the
fact.
do
we
know
that's
what
judge
giles
would
have
ruled
at
the
time?
perhaps.
but
there
are
other
judges,
federal
judges,
who
were
ruling
otherwise
at
the
time,
and
the
third
circuit--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--the
point
is,
your
honor,
that
that's
not
the
test
for
equitable
tolling.
there
are
all
sorts
of
arguments
that
a
defendant
can
make
about
why
the
law
is
unclear.
it
wouldn't
have
had
to
depend
on
the
federal
court's
understanding
of
this
particular
state
law.
a
defendant
could
come
along
and
he
could
say,
well,
i'm
unclear
about
the
application
of
(d)(2).
i've
got
circuits
like
the
ninth
circuit
who
tell
me
that
even
if
my
petition
is
blatantly
untimely
in
state
court,
it
still
tolls.
i
filed,
knowing
i
was
untimely
in
state
court,
because
the
ninth
circuit
tells
me
that
i'm
still
going
to
get
tolling,
and
now
you
tell
me
i'm
not
going
to
get
tolling?
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
i...
i
have...
there
are
some...
really
some...
some
threshold
problems
with
equitable
tolling
that--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--well,
it's--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--it
certainly
shouldn't
be
a
plausible
ground
test,
and
even
the
petitioner
agrees
with
that
position,
your
honor.
and
it
certainly
would
work
if
we
adopted,
as
i
think
congress
did,
a
system
like
the
one
that
justice
scalia
spelled
out
because
then
the
defendant
knows.
and
i'd
like
to
get
back,
as
i
was
discussing
with
justice
kennedy,
to
what
the
defendant
knows.
he
knows
that
if
he's
outside
the
time
that
he's
guaranteed
automatic
review,
whether
direct
appeal
or
state
review,
state
post-conviction
review,
that
his
chances
of
exhausting
more
claims
in
state
court--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--your
honor,
the...
the
congress
that
passed
this
statute
of
limitations
is
the
same
congress
that
made
the
decision
about
whether
habeas
petitioners
would
be
appointed
counsel
or
not.
so
to
say
that
we
can't
really
apply
the
statute
of
limitations
because
it
would
be
unfair
as
to
those
petitioners
who
are
unrepresented
would
be
essentially
to
undercut
the
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--the
practical
approach
to
the
problem
is
to
look
at
the
statute
that
says
you
have
a
year.
if
you
file
your
petition
within
that
year,
whatever
you've
got
at
the
end
of
that
year,
you
can
take
to
federal
court
and
be
confident
that
it's
exhausted.
if
you
want
to
do
something
after
that
year,
you
can't
be
confident
anymore.
all
you
have
to
do
is...
is
count
a
year.
now,
if
something
comes
up
after
that
time,
you're
supposed
to
go
to
state
court
first,
even
if
you've
got
something
in
federal
court.
this
statute
of
limitations
isn't
supposed
to
be
interpreted
in
order
to
make
the
federal
successive
petitions
standard
moot
and
unnecessary.
it
exists
for
a
reason.
so
if
a...
if
a
claim
arises
at
a
later
point,
after
you
have
finished
your
guaranteed
review
in
state
court,
go
back
to
state
court,
whether
or
not
you've
got
something
pending
in
federal
court.
don't
put
that
new
claim
in
with
your
old
claims
in
federal
court
because
then
you
have
a
mixed
petition.
if
you
get
exhaustion
in
state
court,
whether
you're
timely
or
untimely,
you're
going
to
exhaust.
you
can
then
go
back
to
federal
court
with
a
request
for
a
successive
petition.
it...
that's
what
you
have
to
do
and
that's
appropriate
because
that's
how
congress
set
up
the
statute,
with
the
1-year
filing
deadline
and...
and
a
provision
for
successive
petitions.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
no,
your
honor,
because
all
the
court
is
doing
is
deciding
whether
the
time
bar
applies,
and
in
order...
in
a
state
that
has
those
kind
of
categories,
what
the
court
is,
in
effect,
doing
is
deciding
what
kind
of
time
limit
applies
to
this
particular
petition.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor,
that's
really
true
of
every
kind
of
statute
of
limitations
issue
that
can
come
up.
take
away
those
three
exceptions.
just
have
the
1-year
flat
time
bar.
does
that
mean
that
the
state
court
isn't
going
to
have
to
take
some
time
to
look
at
it
and
decide?
what
if
there's
a
prisoner
mailbox
question?
what
if
there's
an
amendment
question
of
the
type
that
this
court
just
granted
cert
on
last
month
in
mayle
v.
felix?
what
if
there's
a
question
about
how
to
compute--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--that's
right
because
during
that
time,
the
state
court
is
deciding
on
timeliness,
and
if
it's
untimely,
it
was
untimely
as
of
the
point
of
filing.
that's
what
makes
it
a
filing
requirement.
you
take
your
claim
and
you
file
it--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i'm
sorry.
i...
i
think
i
understand
artuz
to
have
said
that
if
the
application
was
untimely,
then
it
was
not
properly
filed
and
it
was
not
properly
filed
from
the
get-go,
your
honor.
the
question
that
was
reserved
in
artuz
is
whether
something
about
exceptions
changes
that
statement
in
artuz.
and
my
response
is
that
certainly
nothing
about
the
kind
of
exceptions
that
were
present
in
this
case
changed
the
response.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
in
pennsylvania,
of
course,
all
you
have
to
do
to
be
timely
is
file
within
the
1
year.
and
whatever
you've
exhausted
is
done.
that...
i'd
like
to
go
from
that
into
expanding
more
on
the
equitable
tolling
because
i
think
that
that
plays
in
here.
this
defendant
had
two
rounds.
the
first
round
was
4
years,
not
even
just
3,
but
i
believe
closer
to
4
years
before
there
was
a
filing
deadline
in
either
state
court
or
federal
court.
now,
when
you
decide
to
wait...
he
didn't
have
a
filing
deadline,
but
when
you
decide
to
wait,
you
take
your
chances.
there's
a
rule
that's
even
more
immutable
than
time
limits
or
jurisdiction,
and
it
is
that
things
change.
when
you
wait,
you
take
the
risk
that
your
evidence
may
change,
the
facts
may
change,
the
law
may
change.
that's
what
happened
to
this
defendant
while
he
sat
and
did
nothing.
he
says
he
was
learning
the
law
during
that
period.
well,
then
would
it...
is
it
just
4
years?
what
if
it
had
taken
him
8
years
or
12
years
to
learn
the
law?
he
had
the
filing
deadline
that
came
up.
he
never
claimed
that
he
didn't
understand
what
it
was.
he
could
have
beaten
any
of
those
filing
deadlines
in
state
or
federal
court.
he
says,
i
have
no
incentive
for
delay.
i'm
not
a
capital
defendant.
all
i
wanted
was
a
speedy
resolution
of
my
claims.
but
in
that
case,
he
didn't
need
a
filing
deadline
to
make
himself
come
to
court.
the
fact
is
that
there
are
thousands
of
cases
in
which
noncapital
defendants
file
these
kinds
of
late
petitions,
and
the
state
courts
are
trying
to
deal
with
them.
and
this
is
the
way
that
pennsylvania
chose
to
try
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
state
court,
in
its
state
courts,
not
just
for
capital
cases,
but
for
noncapital
cases.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
the
incentive
that
they
have
to
drag
it
on
is
that
they
may
come
up
with
a
new
legal
theory
that
attracts
a...
a
court
that
they
didn't
present
before,
that
new
facts
may
come
up,
may
arise
that
they
try
to
argue.
that's
what
this
defendant
did,
although
they
weren't
really
new.
they
were
facts
that
were
available
to
him
as
of
the...
the
day
of
his
guilty
plea
in
1986.
he
claimed
that
they
were
new.
and
if
there's
no
cost
to
doing
that,
if
in
fact
there
may
be
a
benefit
to
doing
that,
then
why
not?
if--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--well,
it's
certainly
something
that--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--it's
certainly
something
that
any
prosecutor
would
tell
you,
your
honor.
this...
this
crime
occurred
20
years
ago
in
1985.
and
this
was
a
relatively
simple
case.
a
police
officer
came
on
to
the
scene
while
the
defendant
was
bashing
the
head
of
the
victim
with
a
nightstick.
but
even
in
a
simple
case,
you're
going
to
have
problems
of
proof,
and
the
party
with
the
primary
problems
of
proof
is
the
party
with
the
burden
of
proof,
and
that's
the
prosecution.
so,
of
course,
there's
going
to
be
a
problem
for
the
prosecution,
and
that's
why
we
adopt...
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
adopt
this
kind
time
limit.
even
once
the
petitioner
did
come
back
to
state
court,
though,
your
honor...
and
this
gets
back
to
the
questions
that
justice
o'connor
was
raising
initially...
he
raised
essentially
the
same
claims.
he
says,
well,
this
time
around,
i
put
them
in
a
different
guise,
different
facts
in
support
of
my
claim
about
my
guilty
plea,
different
legal
labels.
yes,
but
all
in
the
context
of...
of
ineffective
assistance
because
the
only
way
he
could
get
into
court
a
second
time
for
a
second
round
of
post-conviction
review
in
pennsylvania
was
to
say
that
my
lawyer
at
my
first
round
of
state
post-conviction
review
was
ineffective.
he
didn't
attach
these
affidavits
from
my
mother
and
father.
he
didn't
call
it
due
process
instead
of
whatever
else
he
called
it.
now,
petitioner
could
make
those--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--the
reason
the
colloquy
wasn't
adequate
is
precisely
for
the
same
reason
that
he
was
attacking
his
lawyers,
in
the
petitioner's
view,
that
it
didn't
explain
to
him
the
meaning
of
a
life
sentence.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
your
honor,
that's
a
claim
that
was
waived
if
it
was
not
presented
in
the
first--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--but...
but--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--but
the
only
way
that
the
petitioner
could
exhaust
that
claim
in
state
court
on
a
second
round
of
post-conviction
review
would
be
to
put
it
in
terms
of
ineffective
assistance
of
first
post-conviction
counsel.
and,
of
course,
he
can't
then
take
that
claim
and
come
to
federal
court
because
claims
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
post-conviction
counsel
are
not
cognizable
on
federal
habeas
review.
so
not
only
did
he
wait
4
years
when
he
had
no
filing
deadline
impediments
to
come
to
court,
but
he
then
raised
in
state
court
claims
that
he
couldn't
have
turned
into
exhausted
federal
claims
anyway
in
order
to
add
to
what
was
available
to
him,
to
the
universe
of
claims
that
were
available
to
him
after
his
initial
round
of
state
post-conviction
review.
and
we're
talking
about
equitable
tolling
for
somebody
who
only
has
a
problem
because
of
his
own
inaction
for
4
years
and
who
even
then
spent
another
3
years
in
state
court
on
claims
that
he
couldn't
bring
to
state
court,
and
even
then,
in
the
face
of
developing
state
law
about
the
time
bar,
refused
to
look
at
it.
so
not
only
did
we
have
a
statute
that
says
you're
in
trouble,
you're
time-barred
now--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
in
the
appendix.
and
what
the
judge--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--what
the
judge
said
three
times
is,
you
understand
that
your
sentence
will
be
life,
and
the
petitioner
said
yes
each
time.
now,
his
claim
later
on...
and
he's
right.
he
didn't
think
that
was
his
claim
when
he
filed
his
first
post-conviction
review
petition
in
1986.
he
just
thought
his
claim
was
that
his
plea
was
involuntary.
once
he
got
counsel
appointed,
it
turned
out
that
his
claim
was,
oh,
my
lawyer
didn't
specifically...
neither
my
lawyer
nor
the
judge
specifically
told
me
that
by
life
they
meant
life
as
opposed
to
something
less
than
life.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
well,
but,
your
honor--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--i'm
sorry.
that's
what
happened.
that
claim
was
litigated
on
the
first
round
of
post-conviction
review
and
the
state
courts
rejected
it
because
of
the
transcript
of
the
colloquy.
the
defendant
could
have
taken
that
claim
to
federal
court
in
1992.
he
just
didn't.
now--
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
--he...
he
knew
it
appeared
in
the
transcript.
that
was
the
basis
of
his
claim
in...
on
state
post-conviction
review.
he
had
not
one
but
two
lawyers
appointed
for
that
review
and
he
litigated
it
on
up
through
the
state
highest
court.
but
even
when
he
came
back
in
1996,
he
knew
the
statute
was
there.
he's
never
claimed
he
was
confused
by
the
new
time
bar.
he
says,
i
thought
i
would
get
some
exceptions
to
it.
but
then
the
state
court
came
and
said,
no,
it's
jurisdictional,
no
exceptions.
defendant
didn't
do
anything.
it
was
1997,
still
2
years
before
he
filed
in
federal
court.
didn't
take
note
of
that
state...
he
took
note
of
it.
he
acknowledges
in
his
pleadings
that
he
knew
about
it,
but
he
decided
not
to
go
to
federal
court
anyway.
more...
more
cases
come
out
from
the
state
courts,
even
the
decision
in
his
own
court...
in
his
own
case
from
the
state's
highest
court.
even
when
we
get
to
july
of
1999
and
the
state
supreme
court
denies
review
on
the
timeliness
question
in
his
own
case,
the
petitioner
says,
even
then
how
was
i
supposed
to
know
that
i
wasn't
going
to
get
some
kind
of
exception
to
the
state
time
bar?
i
didn't
know
that
until
the
next
month
when
another
case
came
out
from
the
state
supreme
court.
this
was
the
third
or
the
fourth
from
the
state
supreme
court
in
somebody
else's
case.
only
then
in
august
of
1999
did
i
finally
know
that
i
was
time-barred,
meaning
i
knew
then
that
i
had
never
been
getting
any
tolling,
that
for
the
last
3
years,
i
didn't
have
1
day
of
tolling
on
my
federal
claims.
and
at
that
point
did
he
then
go
to
federal
court?
even
then
he
didn't.
even
in
august
1999
when
the
petitioner
says,
finally
i
know
that
i've
been
out
of
luck
for
the
last
3
years,
that
i'm
3
years
late
to
federal
court,
does
he
rush
in
then?
no.
he
waits
another
5
months
after
august
of
1999
to
finally
come
to
federal
court
and
say
here's
my
petition,
here's
the
claims
that
i've
been
working
on
and
that
i
have
litigated
in
state
court.
that's
not
equitable
tolling,
your
honor.
it's
not
equitable
tolling
under
the
circumstances
of
the
specific
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
it's
not
equitable
tolling
in
general
when
a
petitioner
claims
essentially
i
have
a
mistake
of
law,
i
thought
that
i
would
win,
i
knew
there
were
arguments
against
me,
i
knew
i
might
lose
those
arguments,
but
i
really
thought
i
could
win,
and
therefore
you
should
give
me
equitable
tolling
while
i
pursue
them.
mr.
ronald
eisenberg
thank
you
very
much.
