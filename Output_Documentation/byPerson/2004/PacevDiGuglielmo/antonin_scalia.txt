justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
depends
on
what
the
exceptions
are.
if...
if...
as...
here
i
understand
there
are
three
exceptions.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
all
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
and...
and
if
you
do
not
plead
any
of
those
exceptions
when
you...
when
you
file,
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
properly
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
the
pennsylvania
law
is.
i
mean,
it...
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
a
statute
that
says
it's
untimely
unless
one
of
these
three
exceptions
apply,
and...
and
you...
you
simply
file
and
you
don't
say...
and
it's
clearly
out
of
time
without
one
of
the
exceptions,
and
you
simply
file
and
don't
say
but
this
exception
applies,
it
seems
to
me
that's
not
properly
filed,
whatever
the
rule
in...
in
pennsylvania
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
haven't
pleaded
any
of
them,
none
at
all.
you
just
file
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--several
years
out
of
time.
you...
you
make
no
assertion
that
any
one
of
the...
of
the
three
specific
exceptions
applies.
i
don't
see
how
that
could
possibly
be
considered
properly
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
that...
that's
your
theory
that...
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
it
can
be
rejected
by
the
clerk--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
haven't
made
the
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that
if
that's
the
case,
you
can
file
a...
a
state...
a
state
claim
that
is
plainly
no
good
and
until
the
state
court
finally
gets
around
to...
to
telling
you
that
it's
no
good,
your...
your
aedpa
claim
is
tolled.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
putting
such
a...
i
mean,
the
system
is
not
going
to
work.
it...
it's
a
rare
state
system
that
has
an
absolute
statute
of
limitation
with
no
exceptions.
you're
almost
going
to
have
to
inquire
into
exceptions.
so
you're
saying
this
is
a
way
to
avoid...
avoid
aedpa
endlessly,
just
keep
filing
claims
that
are
out
of
time,
and
until
the
court
finally
gets
around
to
saying
it's
out
of
time,
your...
your
aedpa
time
is
tolled--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
which
time
you
file
another
one
that's
clearly
out
of
time.
and
until
that
one
is
resolved...
i...
this
couldn't
be
what
aedpa
was...
was
meant
to
establish.
justice
antonin
scalia
try...
try
this
simple
rule.
where
you're
dealing
with
a
statute
of
limitations
that
has
exceptions,
it's
not
properly
filed
if
you
do
not
assert
the
existence
of
one
of
those
exceptions.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
not?
we
make
up
a
lot
of
stuff.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
whole
purpose
of
aedpa
was...
was
to
prevent
delay.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what's...
it
seems
to
me
counter-intuitive
about
the
position
you're...
you're
urging
upon
us.
here
is
a
statute
that
was
meant
to
stop
these
things
from
dragging
on
endlessly.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
tell
us
don't
worry
about
these
things
dragging
on
endlessly.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
unrealistic
if
the
states
allow
you
to
file
a
lot
of
stuff.
you're...
you're
saying
the
only
way
the
states
can
stop
this
thing
from
going
on
and
on
and
on
is
to
adopt
an
absolute
rigid
statute
of
limitations,
no
exceptions.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
another
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
properly
filed
and...
and
what
i
proposed
to
you
is
not
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
properly
filed?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you...
how
can
you
tease
that
elaborate
system
out
of...
out
of
the
words
properly
filed
but
you
cannot
tease
out
of
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--simply
showing
on
its
face
that
there's
either
an
absolute
statute
or
that
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
statute
exists?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
circumstances
included
the
fact
that
he
sat
on
this
thing
for
3
years.
he
could
have
brought
it
3
years
earlier,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
claim,
yes,
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
when...
when
you...
when
you
fold
that
into
the
circumstances,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
an
overwhelming
case
for
equitable
tolling.
justice
antonin
scalia
--take
a
whole
lot
to
figure
out
that
you
have
a
claim
where
your
lawyer
told
you...
you
weren't
going
up
for
life
and
it
turned
out
you
were
sent
up
for
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what
does
it
take
if...
can
a
17-year-old
figure
that
something
has
gone
wrong
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
are
there
thousands
of
cases
in
which
noncapital
defendants
file
this
type
of
case?
what...
what
incentives
do
noncapital
defendants
have
to
drag
it
on?
