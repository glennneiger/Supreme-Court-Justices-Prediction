this
problem
couldn't
arise
again
in
pennsylvania,
couldn't
it,
because
they
have
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations?
so
there
would
be
no
way
that
you
could
be
untimely
filing
within
the
1
year
that
you
have
to
go
to
federal
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can?
how
could
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
do.
i
thought
aedpa
you
had
to
file
within
a
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
if
you
miss
the
year,
you're
out
of
luck.
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
so
in
other
words,
he...
his
conviction
is
final.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
60
days
runs
after
his
final
conviction
and
then
between
the
60th
day
and
the
365th
day,
he
has
discovered
his
brady
claim
and
has
not
got
into
court
within
60
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
justice
scalia's
question...
i'm
interested
in
this.
it
couldn't
arise.
that
is,
a
person
who
files
his
state
collateral
petition
more
than
365
days
after
the
finality
of
the
state
court
direct
review,
that
person
is
out
of
luck
under
anybody's
interpretation
because
more
than
a
year
has
passed
since
it
became
final,
i.e.,
the
state
direct
review.
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
that's
what's
puzzling
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
exemptions
still
could
be
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
lost
on
that
one.
suppose
that
you
wanted
some
kind
of
a...
suppose
that
the
majority
wanted
a
standard
that
would
prevent
absolutely
frivolous
filings
on
the
basis
of...
of
statute
of
limitations.
would
you...
what
standard
would...
what...
what's
our
choice
of
standards
there?
could
we...
one,
obviously,
that
the
prisoner
has
to
be
in
good
faith.
another
could
be
he
has
to
be
in
good
faith
and
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
argument
that
it
hasn't
run.
maybe
there
are
others
that
you've
thought
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
a...
a
rule
requiring
good
faith
or
reasonable
argument
in
death
cases?
in
all
the
other
cases,
there's
no
incentive
to
do
this
endless
filing,
and
in
death
cases,
there
is.
so
in
those
death
cases,
we
would
insist
that
it
is
not
properly
filed
if
it's
out
of
time
unless
the
prisoner
in
good
faith
and
with
a
plausible
argument,
a
reasonable
argument
thought
it
was
in
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
think
it
actually...
i
mean,
in...
i
think
they're
about
equal,
aren't
they,
in
respect
to
language?
and
the
argument
against
the
other
one
is
that
prisoners
are
going
to
get
mixed
up
about
it.
they...
they
don't
know
exactly
what
they're
supposed
to
put.
the
argument
against
the
one
i
proposed
is
it
adds
complexity
of
decision-making.
sort
of
between
the
two,
it's
rather
hard
to
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
each
have
their
problems.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it...
it's
my...
i
still
have
a
feeling
that
this
is
a
limited
universe.
now,
my
reason
for
thinking
that
is
that
the
federal
statute
says
you
have
to
file
within
a
year
of...
and
then
it
lists
four
dates.
and
the
middle
two
are
special
new
cases,
unusual
probably.
the
first
one
and
the
fourth
one
are
the
important
ones.
the
first
one
is
final
in
the
state
courts,
your
first
round,
and
the
fourth
one
is
newly
discovered
evidence.
now,
my
guess
is
most
states
also
allow
you
for
collateral...
to
file
collateral
relief
in
those
two
circumstances.
and
in
most
states
probably
you
get
nearly
a
year
from
the
same
kind
of
event.
so
if
you
go
after
the
year,
you're
out
of
luck
in
federal
court.
if
you're
within
the
year,
you're
probably
okay
for
the
state.
but
there
are
a
few
states
that
have...
maybe
pennsylvania...
just
60
days
from
one
of
the
events,
newly
discovered
evidence,
but
a
year
for
the
federal.
so
we're
talking
about
people
who
file
between
2
and
12
months.
that...
that
must
be
a
pretty
limited
class.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
have
i
got
it
right?
have
i
got
this
complicated
thing
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
let's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
let's
suppose
to
get
away
from
it...
can
i
go...
are
you
finished
with
equitable
tolling
because
i
want
to
go
back
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i...
i
have
a
general
question
which
is
not
pennsylvania.
i've
looked
up
or
got
a
rough
idea
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
a
first
petition
in
many
states,
and
most
of
them
are
a
year
or
more.
so
there's
no
problem.
but
11
have
less
than
a
year,
and
in
particular,
oklahoma
has
3
months
apparently.
and
oklahoma
is...
a
lot
of
death
cases
come
out
of
oklahoma.
so
what
rule
would...
where
i
have
to
have...
i
focus
on
oklahoma
for
the
reason
that
i
think
this
has
bite
only
in
death
cases
because
i
don't
see
why
anybody
would
want
to
abuse
the
system
except
in
a
death
case.
but
there
are
a
lot
there.
now,
am
i
supposed
to
say
in
oklahoma
which
has
the
90
days
but
exceptions,
that
where
somebody
has
filed
a
petition
in
state
court,
let's
say,
on
the
180th
day,
and
he
thinks
an
exception
applies,
is
he
supposed
to
also
run
to
federal
court
and
file
a
protective
petition
which
could
well
have
been
dismissed
on
exhaustion
grounds?
what's
he
supposed
to
do
and
how
is
he
supposed
to
know
what
to
do?
and
one
system
that
might
work
is
justice
scalia's
idea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
another
that
might
work
is...
is
requiring
in
death
cases
that
it
be
a...
a
plausible
ground
or
something
like
that.
i
want
to
know
your
opinion
of
how
to
deal
with
that
circumstance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually
most
prisoners
are
not
represented,
i
don't
think,
at
this
stage.
they...
they
haven't
a
clue
about
the
word
exhaustion,
and
they
haven't
a
clue
about
the
statute
of
limitations.
so
they
file
a...
a
paper
in...
in
the
state
court,
and
they
say
this
roughly
is
what
my
problem
is.
is
that
what
happens,
or
are
they
all
quite
educated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
trying
to
get
from
you
what
is
your
opinion
of
a
practical
approach
to
this
problem
in
oklahoma,
say.
