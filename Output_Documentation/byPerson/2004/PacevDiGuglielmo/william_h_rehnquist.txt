chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
judgment
of
the
court
to
announce
in
pace
versus
diguglielmo.
the
antiterrorism
and
the
effective
death
penalty
act
establishes
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
for
filing
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition.
but
it
tolled
the
limitation
period
while
a
properly
filed
application
for
state
conviction
relief
is
pending.
petitioner
john
pace
filed
his
federal
habeas
petition
outside
the
one-year
limit
but
argued
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
statutory
and
equitable
tolling.
we
now
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit’s
rejection
of
petitioner’s
contentions.
petitioner’s
untimely
state
of
postconviction
petition
was
not
properly
filed
and
therefore
did
not
toll
the
limitation
period,
and
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
equitable
tolling.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
joined.
