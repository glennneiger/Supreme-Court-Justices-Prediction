didn't
it
come
from
the
west...
did
it
come
from
the
west
coast
originally?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
what
is
the
standard
you
use,
the
definition
to
use
to
get
to
that
result?
is
this
your
practically
point
again?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you've
given
us
the
answer.
what's
the
standard
that
you
use
to
get
to
that
answer?
do
you
go
back
to
the
definition
that
it...
it
cannot
practicably
be
used?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then...
and
then
the
riverboat...
it
depends
on
how...
how
permanently
it's
affixed
to
the
land.
suppose
it
stays
there
for
10
years.
it...
it
can
go
anytime,
but
it
stays
there
for
10
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there's
an
intent
component
to
your
test
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
in
navigation
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
that
is
a
rule
that,
i
take
it,
you
do
not
wish
us
to
adopt,
or
maybe
you
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
we
need
to
use
the
word
practical
or
practically
in
section
3?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
problems
in
computing
maintenance
and
cure
in
a
case
like
this
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
were
just
left
it
up
to
the
law.
are
there
problems
in
computing
what
cure
and
maintenance--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
had
been...
suppose
there
had
been
very
rough
water--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and...
and
the
crane
operator
was
the...
was
operating
it
and
the
water
came
over
the
freeboard
and
it
capsized.
that's...
that
would
be
the
perils
of
the
sea,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
this
is
my...
this
is
a
special
day
in
boston--
[laughter]
--which...
which
they
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--every
86
years
or
something.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
by
the
coast
guard.
