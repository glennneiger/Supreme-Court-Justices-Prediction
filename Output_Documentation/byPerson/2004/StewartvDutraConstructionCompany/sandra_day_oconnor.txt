justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
super
scoop
practically
capable
of
transportation
on
water,
counsel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
we
would
say
about
all
these
gambling
casino
boats
that
are
parked
on
the
side
of
the
mississippi
river?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
your
answer?
there
are
lots
of
these
gambling
boats
that
are
parked--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--along
the
side
of
the
river.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
blatt,
the...
there
was
a
brief
filed
by
signal
i
think
that
argues
that
a
jones
act
vessel
has
to
provide
food,
care
and
lodging
to
be
covered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
might
affect
the
decision
of
whether
they
are
seamen
covered
under
the
jones
act.
it
might
still
be
a
vessel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
may
be
other
aspects
of
the
test
that
aren't
met--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
the
thing
is
tied
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
it
might
be
a
vessel,
but
probably
not
in
navigation
while
it's
tied
up
or
in
mothballs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
exactly.
and...
and
in
chandris,
this
court
rejected
the
snapshot
approach
to
determining
what's
a
vessel
and
the
first
circuit
seemed
to
go
back
to
that.
and
certainly
what
the
first
circuit
did
seems
in
serious
tension
with
this
court's
cases.
it
just
didn't
follow
the
same
line
that
we
had
outlined.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
and
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
chandris.
so
i...
i
think
there's
a
problem
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it
might
be
much
simpler
to
rely
on
1
u.s.
code,
section
3
and
our...
our
definition,
as
we've
described
it
there,
and
then
deal
with
other
situations
within
the
framework
of
the
definition
of
seaman
and
the
other
issues
that
arise.
and
it
seems
like
the
first
circuit
went
backwards
from
chandris
back
to
giovanni
which
basically
had
been
rejected.
so
that's
the
concern.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
congress
adopted
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
stewart
versus
dutra
construction
company
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
