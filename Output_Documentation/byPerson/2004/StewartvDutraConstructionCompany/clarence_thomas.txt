justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
as
part
of
the
project
to
extend
the
massachusetts
turnpike,
respondent
dutra
construction
company
dug
a
trench
beneath
the
boston
harbor
using
its
dredge
named
the
super
scoop.
the
super
scoop
is
a
floating
platform
with
the
bucket
beneath
it
that
removes
silt
from
the
ocean
floor
and
dumps
it
onto
adjacent
scows.
the
super
scoop
has
limited
means
of
self-propulsion
but
can
navigate
short
distances
using
its
anchors
and
cables.
when
dredging
the
trench
here
it,
it
typically
moved
once
every
couple
of
hours,
petitioner
willard
stewart
worked
for
dutra
as
a
marine
engineer
aboard
the
super
scoop.
stewart
was
injured
when
the
super
scoop
and
one
of
its
scows
collided.
he
sued
dutra
under
the
jones
act
claiming
that
he
was
a
seaman
injure
by
dutra’s
negligence.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
dutra
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
with
further
proceedings.
the
test
for
whether
stewart
was
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act
appears
in
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
which
defines
a
seaman
as
a
master
or
member
of
a
crew
of
any
vessel.
there
is
no
question
that
stewart
was
a
member
of
the
super
scoop
crew.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
super
scoop
is
a
vessel.
we
hold
that
it
is.
at
the
time,
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers’
compensation
act
was
enacted
in
1927
section
3
of
the
revised
statute
of
1873
supplied
a
default
definition
of
the
term
vessel.
section
3's
definition
now
codified
as
1
u.s.c.
section
3
has
remained
virtually
unchanged
to
the
present
day.
it
defines
a
vessel
as
any
watercraft
used
or
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
on
water.
dredges
have
consistently
been
considered
watercraft
capable
of
maritime
transportation.
now,
as
in
the
past,
dredges
like
the
super
scoop
carried
machinery,
equipment,
and
a
crew
over
water
in
performing
their
work.
thus,
for
the
past
120
years,
this
court
and
lower
courts
have
looked
to
sections
3's
definition
when
interpreting
the
maritime
statutes,
and
they
have
uniformly
treated
dredges
as
vessels
within
the
meaning
of
section
3.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
super
scoop
was
not
a
vessel
because
its
primarily
purpose
was
not
navigation
or
commerce,
and
because
it
was
not
an
actual
transit
at
the
time
of
stewart’s
injury.
section
3
requires
neither.
section
3
requires
only
that
a
watercraft
be
used
or
capable
of
being
used
for
maritime
transportation
not
that
it
be
used
primarily
for
that
purpose,
nor
that
does
a
watercraft
passed
in
and
out
of
jones
act
coverage
depending
on
whether
it
is
motionless
or
moving
at
any
given
moment.
a
vessel
is
no
less
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
when
it
is
at
anchored
docked
for
loading
or
berthed
for
repairs.
because
the
super
scoop
was
engaged
in
maritime
transportation
when
stewart
was
injured
it
was
a
vessel
and
thus,
stewart
was
a
seaman
eligible
for
recovery
under
the
jones
act.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
