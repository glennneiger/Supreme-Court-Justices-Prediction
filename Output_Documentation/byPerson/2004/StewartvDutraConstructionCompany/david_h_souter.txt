justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
doesn't...
doesn't
that
put
you
right
back
in
the
problem,
the
original
problem,
with...
with
the
riverboat?
if
all
it
is
is
tied
up,
it
isn't
permanently
taken
out
of
navigation.
it
isn't
precluded.
all
they've
got
to
do
is
cast
the
lines
off
and
it's
out
in
the
water
so
that
the
riverboat
is
the
vessel
and
presumably
we've
got
seamen
working
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying...
and
i...
i
don't
mean
to
disagree
with
you.
you're
saying,
yes,
there
are
going
to
be
a
few
tough
results
under
this
definition.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
you
say
the
function
of
the
vessel,
do
you
mean
the
function
of
the
vessel
in
its
transportation
function?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
would
be
the
answer
to
the
riverboat
problem.
you'd
say
sure,
if
the...
if
the
riverboat
is
capable
simply
of
being
let
go
in
the
water
by
casting
off
lines,
the
riverboat
is
a
vessel.
but
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
turning
all
the...
the
croupiers
and
the
waiters
into
seamen
because
they're
not
contributing
to
the
transportation
function
of
the
vessel.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
out
of
the
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
does...
look,
does
the...
does
the
person
in
charge
of
the
dredge
control
this
process
of
pulling
against
anchor
lines
that
moves
it
8
feet
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
you
can
give
me
a
yes
or
no
answer,
give
me
a
yes
or
no
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that's
why
he's
different
from
the
croupier
then,
isn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
the...
the
guy
in
charge
of
the
dredge
does
control
the
movement
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
what
do
you...
then
what
do
you
do
with
the
croupier?
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
not
participating
in
the
navigation
of
the
vessel.
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
doing
whatever
croupiers
do.
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
no,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
in
the
case
of
the
steam
shovel
operator
on
the
dredge,
do
we
say
that...
that
he
contributes
toward
that
function
because
it
can't
move
unless
he
dredges
first,
so
that
the...
the
whole
object
of
moving
across
the
harbor
to
dredge
includes
the...
the
dredging
part?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
way
we
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
as
long
as...
as
long
as
somebody
is...
is
engaged
in
a
navigation--
justice
david
h.
souter
--function,
everybody
else
comes--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
isn't
that
the
point?
the
dredge
is
there
necessarily
to
move.
the
casino
is
not
there
necessarily
to
move.
