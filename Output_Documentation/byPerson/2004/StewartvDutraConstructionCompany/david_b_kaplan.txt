mr.
david
b.
kaplan
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
received
word
that
the
court
is
interested
in
46
u.s.c.
801,
and
i
intend
to
focus
my
attention
on
that
before
i
get
into
my
argument.
46-801
is
referred
to
as
the
shipping
act,
and
it
was
enacted
in
1916
and
the
amendment
in
1918.
at
that
time,
the
united
states
government
was
involved
in
a
war
and
we
were
interested
in
developing
the
merchant
marine
for
purposes
of
transporting
cargo,
equipment,
and
people
back
and
forth.
and
so
the
amendment
that
was
filed
was
fashioned
after
exactly
1
u.s.c.
3,
but
it
had
some
additional
features
involved,
one
of
which
was
that
a
vessel
that
was
under
construction
was
included
as
part
of
the
act,
one
of
which
was
if
the
owner
intended
to
use
the
vessel
for
transportation,
it
was
included.
it
is
under
no
circumstances
affecting
a
jones
act
claim
because
the
jones
act
requires,
number
one,
a
vessel
in
navigation
and
it
can't
be
on
the
dock
or
being
under
construction,
and
if
it
was
under
construction,
it
wouldn't
have
a
crew.
so
under
the
circumstances,
with
all
due
respect,
it
is
our
judgment
that
we...
we
would
win
on
both
sides.
the
super
scoop
would
indeed,
qualify
under
that
act
as
well
as
under
1
u.s.c.
3.
but
we
think
that
this
goes
a
little
too
far
and
not
appropriate.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
it
is
more
than
practically
capable,
it
actually
is...
actually
transports
its
equipment
and
its
personnel
at
work
and
its--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--indeed,
it
did.
it
came
through
the
west
coast,
unmarried,
however.
it
came
from
the
west
coast
through
panama,
through
the
gulf,
up
the
east
coast,
and,
sir,
if
anything
had
occurred
on
that
trip,
that...
that
would
have
been
considered
a
vessel.
however,
when
it
came
in
to
boston--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--sorry.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
in
fact,
it's
unmanned.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
there
was
nobody
injured
and
unmanned,
yes,
indeed.
but
what...
what
i'm
saying
is
historically
there
has
never
been
a
decision
in
which
a
dredge
was
not
considered
a
vessel
until
this
case
that
we
appear
here
now.
of
course,
i'm
here
to
seek
to
have
you
overrule
the
decision
that
was
rendered.
but
more
importantly,
we
are
having
a
morass
in
the
lower
courts,
and
i'm
here
to
try
and
persuade
this
court
to
establish,
once
and
for
all,
that
there
is
a
standard,
that
there
is
a
definition
for
the
use
of
the
word
vessel
under
the
jones
act.
now,
in
1920,
when
the
jones
act
was
enacted,
there
was
no
reference
to
the
use
of
the
word
vessel,
and
we
know
that
when
that
happens,
we
have
to
seek
to
find
what
was
the
meaning,
what
was
the
established
meaning
at
that
time.
and
the
way
we
do
that
is
to
look
first
to
statutory
law,
and
in
addition
we
look
to
case
law.
the
statutory
law
is
clear.
in
1873
in
the
revised
statutes
it
makes
it
very
clear
that
section
3
describes
a
vessel
is
any
watercraft
that...
or
other
artificial
contrivance
used,
or
capable
of
being
used,
for
transportation
on
water.
with
that
standard
in
1873,
this
court
in
1907
tried
the
case
of
ellis
v.
the
united
states
and
did
apply
that
revised
statute
and
decided
that
the
dredges
that
were
working
in
the
city
of...
in
the
boston
harbor
were
indeed
vessels
and
that
the--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--very
interesting
question,
justice
scalia.
however,
this
court--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--this
court
seemed
to
have
focused
right
on
point
in
the
cases
of
cope
in...
cope
was
early,
1903,
and
in
the
case
of
evansville
in
1926
when
they
added
the
two
words,
practically
capable.
the
cope
case
was
a
drydock
and
it
was
run
into
by
somebody
and
they
sought
damages.
and
the
court...
this
court
said,
wait
a
minute.
in
that
case,
that's
a
drydock.
it
goes
up
and
down.
it
doesn't
navigate.
it
doesn't
transport
people
or
cargo
over
water.
so
they
said
it's
not
practically
capable
of
fulfilling
under
the
revised
statute.
the
easiest
case
is
1926
when
this
court
again
in
evansville
made
it
very
clear
that
a
wharfboat,
which
on
occasion
was
taken
out.
once
a
year,
i
think
the
evidence
is,
they
would
take
it
out
and
move
it
back.
but
it
was
affixed
to
the
land.
it
had
its
telephone.
it
had
its
sewage.
it
had
all
connections
to
the
land.
and
this
court
again
used
1
u.s.c.
3,
but
did
say
that
it
wasn't
practically
capable
of
performing.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
your
honor,
these
are
a
problematic
case,
and
the
whole
thing
is
determined
on
whether
or
not
it's
in
navigation.
if
a
vessel
is--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--if
the--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--if
the
gambling
boat
has
lost
its
ability
to
be
in
navigation,
if
it's
affixed
to
the
land,
if
it
has
connections
to
the
land,
if
it
doesn't
expect
to
go
into
navigation,
it
is
out
of
navigation.
it's
owner
has
taken
that
vessel
from
a
navigable
vessel
into
out
of
navigation.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
say
that
again,
please.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
well,
the
standard
that
i'm
seeking
to
have
the
court
employ
is
1
u.s.c.,
section
3,
which
says,
any...
a
vessel
is
any
watercraft
or
other
artificial
contrivance
used,
or
capable
of
being
used--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--if
in
fact
it
stays
there
for
10
years
and
it
does
not
move,
that's
evidence
that
the
owner
intended
that
vessel
to
lose
its
position
in
navigation.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
there...
there...
technically
one
could
say
break
the
bonds
that
hold
it
to
the
dock
and
then
take
it
out
and
use
it
because
once
a
vessel,
always
a
vessel?
the
answer
is
no.
according
to
this
court,
this
court
said--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--when
it's
not
practically
capable
of
doing
it.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
the
answer
is
no.
it...
it
does
not
qualify
if
it's
removed
from
navigation.
once
the
vessel
is
taken
out
of
navigation,
as
in
justice
scalia's
situation
where
that
vessel
is
on
the
land,
it
is
being
used
as
a
completely
different--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--i
say
it's
not
a
vessel.
it's
out
of
navigation.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
and
that
only
applies--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--i'm
trying
to
establish
that
if
it's
in
navigation,
then
it
is
a
vessel.
if
the
owner
of
that
vessel
removed
it
from
any
chance
of
navigation,
made
it
a
different
kind
of
a
vessel,
it
is
no
longer
in
navigation.
it
remains
a
vessel,
but
it's
not
a
vessel
in
navigation.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
justice
souter,
if
on
that
situation
where
all
they
have
to
do
is
cast
the
lines
off
and
go
out
to
sea,
then
of
course
it
remains
a
vessel,
and
it
remains
in
navigation.
and
it
is...
it
fits
all
the
elements
of
the
requirements.
but
if
that--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--there
may
be,
but
there's
got
to
be
some
practically
capable
influence
that
this
court
has
already
focused
on
to
say
whether
that
particular
vessel
is
practically
capable
of
being
in
navigation.
if
it's
out
of
navigation,
it's
never
going
to
be
back
in
navigation,
and
there's
nothing
more
that's
going
to
happen
to
that
as
a
vessel,
then
of
course
it's
no
longer
a
vessel
that
would
qualify.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
yes.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
like
the
establishments
from
the--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--pier
4,
yes.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
justice
breyer,
we're
talking
primarily
of
jones
act.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
jones
act
requires
a
relationship
between
the
worker
and
the
vessel.
so--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--this
court
has
already
established--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--what
the
standards
are
for
jones
act,
whether
a
person
qualifies.
there
are
filters
between
whether
a
person
is
a
jones
act
seaman
or
not.
for
example,
there
has
to
be
a
vessel.
there
has
to
be
a
vessel
in
navigation.
there
has
to
be
a
economic
relationship
between
the
worker
and
his
vessel
and
he
has
to
contribute
towards
the
mission
or
to
the
function
of
that
vessel.
he
has
to,
more
importantly,
have
a
substantial
relationship
to
his
vessel,
both
with
respect
to
duration
and
with
respect
to
nature.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
yes.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
precisely.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
there
is
a
safeguard
between
the
vessel
and
whether
a
person
qualifies
as
a
jones
act
seaman
on
that
vessel.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
oh,
i
do
not.
i
do
not,
indeed.
i
say--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--i
say
he's
covered
by
the--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--why
isn't
what?
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
is
the
croupier
contributing
to
the
function
of
the
vessel?
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
it
is.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
the
manner
in
which
the
dredge...
this
dredge
worked...
by
the
way--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--yes.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
that
man
controls
not
only--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--the
croupier
does
not
control
the
motion.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
absolutely.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
i
do
believe
that.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
well,
if
the
croupier
is
participating
in
the
navigation
of
the
vessel,
we
don't
care
anymore.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
well--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--they
don't
hand
me
any
money,
i'll
tell
you.
what
i'm
trying
to
establish
here
is
that
there
really
is
a
distinction
between
the
law
applicable
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
vessel,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
1
u.s.c.
clearly
describes
what
a
vessel
is
and
should
be
for
jones
act
purposes.
the
second
part
of
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
qualifies
and
is
warranted
to
have
the
jones
act
coverage.
so
as
to
the
vessel...
as
to
this
coverage,
we
know,
through
wilander
and
through
chandris,
this
court
has
established
some
very
sensible
and
good
standards
by
which
a
person
can
or
cannot
be
a...
a
jones
act
seaman.
now
the
only
thing
that's
necessary
is
we
have
to
round
the
circle
up
to
determine
what
is
a
vessel
for
jones
act
purposes.
1
u.s.c.
seems
to
satisfy
it.
it's
important
to
note
that
in
this
particular
case
this
is
a
coast
guard-certified,
inspected
vessel.
this
vessel
is...
carries...
it
has
a
1290
ton
itself
and
it
carries
cargo
of
466
ton.
it
is...
it
has
navigation
lights.
it
has
to
be
ballasted.
it
has
to
be
load-lined.
when
it
goes
to
work,
the
way
in
which
it
moves
is
as
follows.
the
tugs
take
the
anchors
out
50
feet.
now,
as
the
operator
is
using
that
bucket
to
dump
into
the
scows,
he's
also
handling
the...
the
vessel
is
also
moving
through
its
own
deck
winches.
they
spool
up
on
their
own
winches.
so
in
addition
to
where
he's
digging,
they're
also
moving
so
that
instead
of
just
digging
a
hole,
they're
digging
the
trench.
so
under
all
the
circumstances,
this
super
scoop,
because
it
has
a
crew,
a
captain
and
a
crew
of
10,
because
they
have
to
wear
lifesaving
devices,
because
they
have
a...
a
standby
vessel
for
safety
purposes
right
there
by
order
of
the
coast
guard,
because
it
is
exposed
to
all
the
weather
and
navigation
problems
that
exist
in
the...
in
boston
harbor,
because
the
risks
are
inherent
in
this
kind
of
work,
this
man
qualifies
as
not
only
a
vessel
but
as
a
jones
act
seaman.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
oh,
the
scow.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
well,
what
happened
in
this
one,
if
your
honor
please,
is
when...
this
was
a
collision
at
sea.
client
was
aboard
the
scow
when
it
collided
with
the
super
scoop
and
he
was
tossed
down
a
10-foot--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--oh,
indeed.
the
scow
is...
is
what
they
put
the
fill
in,
and
as
differentiated
from
a
barge,
a
scow
has
the
ability
to
open
up
its
bottom
to
let
all
the
fill
out
when
they
get
out
to
sea.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
pardon?
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
the
scow
is
a
vessel.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
the
scow
is
absolutely
a
vessel.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
not
even--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--they
had
to
move
from
here
to
somewhere
else.
that's--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--so
did
the
super...
sorry.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
well,
the
super
scoop
was
not
moving
at
that
moment,
but
the
scow
was
moving--
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
--i
would
take
that,
your
honor,
but
i
would
like
to
extend
it
to
get
a
status...
a
statement
from
this
court
so
that
we
can
remove
the
indecisions,
the
silly
tests
that
the
lower
courts
have
been
creating
for
what
is
a
vessel
and
what
is
not
a
vessel.
mr.
david
b.
kaplan
oh,
my.
thank
you.
