justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
what
is...
i
see
the
first
circuit
as
trying
to
grapple
with
the
very
question
you're
raising,
which
is
i
think
difficult.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course,
it
seems
to
me
fine,
let
section
3
apply.
no
problem
so
far
with
me.
but
that
is
so
broadly
stated
that
if
you
read
it
literally,
my
garage
door
is
a
boat
or
a
vessel
because,
after
all,
it's
capable
of
being
used
in
navigation,
if
worst
came
to
worst.
and
now
you're
trying
to
narrow
it
to
get
out
of
that
absurd
result.
well,
so
did
the
first
circuit.
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
and
you
got
caught
up
in
it.
but
that's...
so...
so
what...
that's
why
i
think
we're
struggling
with
the
words,
and...
and
perhaps
practically...
if
you
mean
by
practically
that
it
is
not
practically
capable
of
navigation,
even
though
it
really
is,
if
it
just
hasn't
been
used
for
navigation
for
a
long,
long
time
and
has
connections
to
the
land
like
jimmy's
harborside
probably
or...
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes,
or
one
like
that.
but
is...
are
those
the
words?
do
we
need
some
other
words
as
well?
we
say
practically
capable
but
practically
capable
has
a
technical
meaning
here
that
it
means
if
there's
close
to
permanent
connection
to
the
land,
it
doesn't
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
could
we
say...
could
we
say
that,
as
well,
it
must
be
unlike
my
garage
door?
a,
it
must
be
a...
a
structure
that
normally
would
have
a
crew
or
that...
a
significant
amount
of
the
time.
we
would
have
a
connection
to
the
water.
it
would
be
capable
of
having
a
master
or
crew.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
is
this
an
easy
case?
because,
after
all,
the
first
circuit
is
struggling
with
the
same
problem
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion,
use
section
3.
that's
fine.
but
you
know
that
the
garage
door
is
not
a
vessel,
and
you
also
know
that
jimmy's
harborside
is
not
a
vessel.
and
you
also
know
that
justice
scalia's
beached
scow
or
something
is
not
a
vessel.
and
i
take
it
nor
is
a
vessel
a
scow
that's
tied
up
for
364
days
of
the
year
and
acts
as
a
picnic
place
and
one
day
they
take
it
out
to
sea
and...
because
they
want
to
move
it
across
the
harbor.
i
guess
that
isn't
a
vessel.
is
it?
or
maybe
it
is.
so
why
is
this
so
easy?
because
the
first
circuit--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--had
a
test,
tries
to
make
those
distinctions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
let's
say
it's
wrong
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
let's
take
section
3.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
taking
section
3,
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
the
same
problems.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'd
like
to
know
your
answer
and
you
just
said
to
scalia
what
i
thought...
justice
scalia
that
i
thought
what
was
an
answer
isn't
because
i
thought
that
word
practical,
as
co-counsel
recommended,
has
a
rather
specialized
meaning
where
we
get
rid
of
a
lot
of
these.
now
you're
saying
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your...
your
view
of
the
word
in
navigation
does
all
the
work
here.
and
so
a...
a
concert
ship,
which
exists,
which
say
is
docked
at
a
dock
for,
let's
say,
300
days
of
the
year
or
maybe
360,
and
those
other
5
days
they...
they
move
it
from
one
town
to
the
next
town
where
it
stays
for
another
4
months,
that
is
in
navigation
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
concert
master
and
the...
the...
all
the
orchestra
players
and
everyone
else
are
covered
by
the
jones
act
even
though,
by
the
way,
none
of
them
has
ever
moved
whatsoever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so,
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
now
we
have,
in
my
concert
ship,
the
concert
master
and
the
whole
orchestra
covered
by
the
jones
act
even
if
none
of
them,
by
the
way,
has
ever
been
even
to
sea
on
that
day
when...
they
take
the
train.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
says--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
terms
of
both
its
duration
and
its
nature,
i.e.,
a
connection
to
a
vessel--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
navigation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
we
clarify
that?
because
i
don't
read
the
cases
saying
what
justice
scalia
just
said
or
what
you...
what
it
says
is
that
a
seaman
must
have
a
connection
to
a
substantial...
in
terms
of
duration
and
nature
connection
to
a
vessel
in
navigation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
obviously,
a
croupier
has
such
a
connection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
being
connected
to
the
navigating
part.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
far.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
you
go...
i
thought
vessel...
the
word
vessel
appears
in
our
cases.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
jones
act.
am
i
right
or
not
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
we
have
a
degree
of
freedom
on
this.
but...
but
the...
the
question
then
is,
is
it...
how...
i'm
getting
the
impression
from
you
and...
and
from
the
sg
that
it's
rather
deeply
embedded
in
the
law,
if
we
start
reading
the
fifth
circuit
cases,
that
if
we
define
x
as
a
vessel,
automatically
it
is
a
vessel
in
navigation,
that
the
cases
have
said
the
word
in
navigation
mean
nothing,
with
one
exception.
the
exception
is
if
you
actually
have
like
a
physical
cemented
connection
to
the
land
so
they
can't
escape.
otherwise,
if
it's
just
tied
up
at
a
dock,
even
if
it
never
goes
to
sea,
those
words,
in
navigation,
have
no
meaning.
if
it's
a
vessel,
it's
a
vessel
in
navigation.
if
it's
my
garage
door,
my
garage
door,
which
can
float,
is
a
vessel
in
navigation.
now,
how
accurate
is
that
assumption
i'm
now
making?
what
would
i
read
in
the
law?
is
that
definition
of
in
navigation
as
meaning
virtually
nothing
really
embedded
in
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
it
is
but
what
is
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
would
it
help?
suppose
we
were
to
say
it
was...
had
to
be
capable,
at
least,
of
having
a
captain
and
crew?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
we
better
not
do
anything
for
the
first
time.
[laughter]
