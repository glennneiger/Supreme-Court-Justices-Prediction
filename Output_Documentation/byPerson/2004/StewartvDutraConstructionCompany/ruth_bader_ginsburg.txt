but
there
was
nobody
on
it
in
that
trip.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
nobody...
there
was
no
one
on
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
be
injured.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kaplan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kaplan,
you
said
two
things
and
i...
i'm
wondering
these
are
separate
or
they're
really
one
concept.
i
thought
your
answer
was
going
to
be
to
the
boat
that
is
used
as
a
diner
or
to
the
casino
that's
tied
up
to
the
land,
that
it's
not
in
navigation.
it
may
satisfy
the
1
u.s.c.
definition
of
vessel,
but
it
has
to
be
in
navigation
to
be
covered
by
the
jones
act.
so
i
thought
that's
what
you
would...
something
is
taken
out
of
navigation
would
not
qualify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
scow
a
vessel
too?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
scow.
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
know
the
circumstances
of
the
accident.
and
you're...
you're
discussing
whether
super
scoop
was
a
vessel.
i'm
asking
if
the
scow
where
the
injury
occurred
is
a
vessel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
explain
to
me
why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
it
wasn't
the
vessel
that
counts.
if
it's
a
vessel
and
it
is
in
fact
the
place
where
he
was
injured
and
it
was
moving,
it...
that
would
be
an
easy
case,
but
somehow
you
have
to
deal
with
the
super
scoop,
and
i'm
wondering
why.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
don't
you
just
say
the
scow
was
a
vessel?
end
of
case.
the
scow
was
a
vessel.
it
was
moving.
that's
where
he
was
injured.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
mr.
kaplan
pointed
out,
all...
the
fact
that
something
is
a
vessel
doesn't
mean
there's
jones
act
coverage,
and
i
think
mr.
kaplan
was
getting
to
the
perils
of
the
sea.
someone
who's
working
on
a
boat
that
is
not
in
the
water
day
in
and
day
out
is
never
exposed
to
the
perils
of
the
sea.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
peril
was
a
collision
with
another
vessel,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
do
you...
how
can
you
possibly
describe
as
a
bright
line
test
anything
that
says
you
have
to
identify
the
primary
function?
plus,
even
if
it's
not
its
primary
function,
if
it
happens
to
be
moving
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
then
there's
coverage.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
bright
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
identical
accident
happens
to
his
buddy
10
minutes
before
when
the
vessel
isn't
moving.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
difference
to
this
extent,
would
you
agree,
that
something
that's
just
tied
up
to
the
dock
and
never
moves
is
different
from
something
that
is
actually
in
the
water
and
whether
you
call
it
transportation,
it
is
moving?
it
has
to
move
to
engage
in
the
construction
of
this
tunnel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
just...
let's
focus
on
what
is
a
vessel
because
someone...
it
may
be
a
vessel
but
the
injured
person
may
not
be
a
seaman.
those
are
two
different
things.
this
is
only
the
first
step.
so
when
you're
bringing
in
what
the
worker
does,
whether
it's
a
croupier
or
whatever,
the
only
question
that
we
are
considering
is,
is
this
dredge
a
vessel?
we're
not
involved
with
the
question
of
whether
the
worker
is
a
seaman
unless
we
pass
that
basic
threshold.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
word
vessel
does
appear
in
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
compensation
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
is
the...
the
only
purpose
of
the
vessel
inquiry
that
we're
involved
in
is
to...
to
say
is
this
person
within
one
injury
compensation
scheme
or
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
why,
in
making
that
inquiry,
should
the
courts
go
off
on
their
own
and
be
inventive
and
come
up
with
a
definition
when
congress
has
given
a
definition
that
can
be
used
by
default?
if
congress
thinks
it
should
be
other
than
the
general
definition
they
have
provided,
congress
can
also
do
that.
but
in
the
meantime,
why
should
the
courts
go
creating
definitions
instead
of
using
the
one
that's
right
there
in
the
statute
book?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
the
court
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
construing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--just
construing
instead
of
not
following,
but
say
by
capable,
congress
must
mean
practically
capable.
