ms.
lisa

thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
ginsburg,
i
take
it
the
reason
that
the
scow
was
not
relied
on
is
because
the
petitioner
worked
99.9
percent
of
his
time
on
the
super
scoop
and
petitioner
never
made
the
argument
that
he
had
a
connection
to
the
scow.
but
this
case,
the
dredge,
the
super
scoop,
was
a
vessel
in
navigation
and
it's
an
easy
case
under
both
standards
because
it
remained
in
service
as
a
means
of
carrying
its
workers
and
equipment
as
it
moved
along
the
boston
harbor.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
i
mean,
you've...
you've
read
it
in
into
evansville
and
cope,
the...
the
drydock
case,
but
it's...
it's
basically
referring
to
any
mobile
watercraft
that
is
practically
capable
of
moving
either
cargo
or
people.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it
much--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
fine,
and
i
think...
like
i
said,
this
is
an
easy
case.
i
could
address
some
of
the...
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--justice
breyer,
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
the...
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
first
circuit
was
way
off
base.
it
did
not
use
section
3
of
title
1.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
what
it
did
is
it--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--okay,
let's...
okay,
let's
go
from
there.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
let
me...
let
me
answer
your
question.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
the...
the...
you
look
at
the
physical
characteristics
and
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
any
type
of
watercraft,
and
if
it's
out
there
moving,
i...
i
think
that
really
is
an
easy
case.
what
i
think
is
bothering...
what
was
bothering
the
first
circuit
is
that
this
vessel
clearly
has
a
stationary
purpose.
it
had
two
essential
and
indispensable
purposes,
one
of
which
was
stationary
and
one
of
which
was
a
mobile
barge.
the
types
of
cases
that
raise
problems
under
1
u.s.c.
3
is
you
have
things
that
meet
the
definition
of
vessel.
the
coast
guard
regulates
them
as
vessels,
but
if
they
have
no
function
to
transport
people
or
things...
and
the
best
example
is
our
country's
battleships.
they're
basically
retired
vessels.
they're
museums.
and
there
are
some
casino
boats
that
function
the
same
way.
they
have
no
transportation
function.
they've
been
withdrawn
from
navigation.
if
you
want
a
legal
standard
for
what
in
navigation
is
it's
this.
it's
what
the
court
said
in
chandris,
which
is
it's
the
status
of
the
ship,
and
that
means
does
it
have
some...
is
it
still
servicing
as
a
ship.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
agree.
the
only
types
of
cases
where
a
vessel
would
lose
its
status
as
a
vessel
if
it's
been
basically...
there...
there
are
basically
two
kinds
of
cases
where
the
casino
boats
or
the
museums
or
hotels
have
lost
their
status.
and
there
are
basically...
there
are
two
examples.
they're
boats
in
a
moat.
they've
been
basically
landlocked
in
through
concrete
or
landfilled
and
they
can't
go
anywhere.
and
the
other
one
that's...
that's
equally
as
common
is
pipes
and
stuff
have
been
driven
through
the
hull
of
the
ship,
and
they're
not
practically
capable
of
transporting
anything.
they'd
have
to
be
overhauled.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
we
think
it's
in
navigation.
if
you
have
a--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--if
it's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
no.
that's
not
correct.
it
just
means
it
might
be
a
vessel
in
navigation.
you
have
cruise
ships,
military
ships,
pleasure
crafts
that
sit
all
the
time,
some
for
years,
but
they're
still
ready
for
another
voyage
when
and
if
they're
needed.
those
are
still
in
navigation.
now,
if
you
have--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i'm
going
to
answer
your
question
on
the
seaman.
if
you've
got
a
worker
that
never
goes
to
sea
on
a
vessel
in
navigation,
the
place
to
deal
with
that
is
not
by
saying
it's
not
a
vessel
or
not
that
it's
not
in
navigation.
but
this
court
emphasized
in
the
harbor
tug
and
barge
case,
as
well
as
the
chandris
case,
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
connection
not
only
in
duration
but
also
with
respect
to
nature.
and
the
court
in
harbor
tug
said
that...
that
inquiry
will
concentrate
on
whether
the
employee's
duties
take
him
to
sea.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there's...
there's
a
decision
in
mcdermott
v.
wilander
that
expressly
holds
that
the
worker
need
not
aid
in
the
navigation
of
the
ship.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
bartenders,
croupiers,
waitresses,
et
cetera
on
cruise
ships
are
all
seamen.
that's
just
the
holding
of
mcdermott
v.
wilander.
now,
there's
still
a
separate
question
of
whether
they're
exposed
to
the
perils
of
sea.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
in
the
ship's
work--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--whether
that
work
is
gambling
or--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
i
just
said
that
they
may
not
be
covered,
but
they--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--they
may
not
be
covered--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--they
may
not
be
covered
if
they
fail
the
last
requirement--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--of
chandris.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
vessel
in
navigation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
and
i...
harbor
tug
v.
barge,
which
is
a
later
opinion,
explains
that
that
test
will
look
at
whether
the
employee's
duties
take
him
or
her
to
sea.
now,
in
this
case
the
dredges
operate
not
only...
only
on
the
water,
but
they're
out
there
usually
away
from
shore
and
are
engaged
in
regular
movement
over
navigable
waters.
and
the
workers
on
that
dredge,
such
as
petitioner,
are
subject
to
the
traditional
perils
of
navigation
which
include
not
only
collision
with
ships,
but
even
capsizing.
barges
such
as
dredges
are
particularly
susceptible
to
capsizing
because
their
distance
between
the
deck
of
the
barge
and
the
water,
which
is
known
as
the
freeboard,
is
low.
in
this
case
it
was
only
5
feet,
and
they
have
a
high
center
of
gravity
because
of
those
derricks
or
cranes
that
are
holding
the
bucket
ship.
and
if
it's
operating
in
poor
weather
or
for
some
reason
it's
overloaded,
they
can
tip
over
and
you
have
a
marine
incident
or
even
casualties.
and
this
worker
was
exposed
to
the
perils
of
navigation
like
other
traditional
seamen.
and
this
court...
we
think
it's
pretty
telling
that
the
court
basically
in
two
decisions
has
resolved
this
case.
you
have
already
used
1
u.s.c.
3
in
the
norton
case
in
defining
what
is
a
vessel
for
purposes
of
the
seamen
exclusion
in
the
longshore
act.
and
then
in
the
ellis
decision,
this
court
has
already
held
that
a
dredge,
including
the
scows
that
were
accompanying
that
dredge,
were
vessels
for
purposes
of
1
u.s.c.
3
and
that
the
workers
were
seamen
and
that
they
were
basically
called
upon
to
perform
the
duties,
more
or
less,
of
ordinary
seamen.
and
every
other
court
that
had
looked
at
the
issue
and
passed
on
it
had
equally
held
that
dredges
were
vessels
for
a
variety
of
maritime
purposes.
that
was
seamen's
liens,
limitation
of
liability,
and...
and
the
overtime...
overtime
laws
in
the
ellis
case.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
with
due
respect
to
the
author,
i
think
that
approach
is
novel,
it's
radical,
and
it's
unsubstantiated.
never
has
the
definition
of
vessel
turned
on
whether
the
watercraft
had
sleeping
quarters.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it's
usually
governed
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
think
it's
something
like
$40
a
day,
and
this
petitioner
was
a
union
laborer.
and
it's...
it's
usually
governed--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--there
used
to
be,
but
in...
there
used
to
be
a
debate,
which
i
think
most
of
the
cases
the
signal
brief
is
relying
on,
in
how
long
maintenance
and
cure
goes
for
and
it
was
a
rather
kind
of
arcane,
tricky
thing,
but
basically
this
court
resolved
it
in
1930.
it
goes
to
maximum
cure.
so
the
seamen
can
no
longer
be
cured.
and
there
used
to
be
a
debate
about
should
it
just
go
to
the
extent
of
the
wage
contract
or
to
some
longer
point,
and
the
court
resolved
that.
but
there
is
no
case
that
has
ever
even
discussed
the
fact
that
a
vessel
turns
on
whether
it
has
sleeping
quarters.
and
we
think
that
brief
is
also
fatally
undermined
by
the
decision
in
ellis
and
all
the...
decision
in
ellis
already
holding
that
vessels...
or
the
workers
were
seamen,
and
there
was
never
been
a
discussion
in
those
dredge
cases
about
whether
they
had
sleeping
quarters.
several
of
those
cases...
the
most
oft-cited
one
is
that
saylor
v.
taylor
case
out
of
the
fourth
circuit,
was
a
maritime
lien
case,
and
those
are
exactly
the
type
of
workers
that
this
court
in
mcdermott
said
were
seamen
who
were
intended
to
be
covered
under
the
jones
act.
if
there
are
no
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
first
circuit's
decision
be
reversed.
