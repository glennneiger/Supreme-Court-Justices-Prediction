mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
in
chandris
and
in
harbor
tug
stated
the
basic
point
of
trying
to
be...
to
separate
lien-based
employees
from
sea-based
employees.
this
court
also
stated
that
was
congress'
goal
in
passing
the
jones
act.
the
court
wrote:
the
jones
act
remedy
is
reserved
for
employees
whose
work
regularly
exposes
them
to
the
special
hazards
and
disadvantages
to
which
they
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
are
subjected.
the
first
circuit's
ruling
is
much
more
likely
to
get
to
that
result.
the
goal
that
this
court
stated
was
congress'
goal
then
is
section...
excuse
me...
1
u.s.c.,
section
3.
justice
o'connor,
your
first
question
had
to
do
with
the
casino
boats,
and
that
is
a
point
that
i
was
going
to
raise.
those
casino
boats
are
traditional
vessels
plying
the
rivers
and
used
mostly
in
the
midwest
and...
and
the
great
lakes.
those
states
have
recently
over
the
last
3
or
4
years
changed
their
law.
the
law
had
been
that
they
had
to
go
up
to...
out
into
navigation.
they've
now
changed
them
and
said,
no,
you
must
stay
dockside.
all
they
are
is
tied
up
dockside.
they
can
be
untied
and
moved
out
at
any
time.
the
cases
that...
and
you're
probably
going
to
have
some
before
you...
are
dealing
with
dealers
and
waiters
and
waitresses
to
go
aboard
the
casino
boat
and
maybe
fall
down
in
the
kitchen
or
something
and
are
injured.
they
have
never
been
on
the
boat
while
it
was
moved
and
it
hasn't
moved
for
the
last
several
years.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--but
breaking
it
down--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--breaking
it
down,
your
honor,
if
the
petitioner
has
his
way,
those
tests
are
met.
the
first
test
is
whether
it's
a
vessel.
it
is
a
vessel.
second
test,
whether
it's
in
navigation.
the
government
has
just
told
you,
and
it
states
in
its
brief,
any
vessel
that
had
any
transportation
purpose
at
all
that
is
still
not...
unless
it's
mothballed...
and
i
think
they
said
today
either
pipes
driven
through
it
or
in
cement...
is
a
vessel
in
navigation.
so
it
is
a
vessel
in
navigation.
we
know
that
the--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--again,
your
honor,
all
it
is
is
tied
to
the
pier.
the
government
has
taken
the
position,
as
has
petitioner,
in
their
briefs
and
here
today
that
it's
still
in
navigation
if
it
can
be
used.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
a
dredge
operator
does
that
any
more
than
the
waiter
on
the
casino.
the
dredge
operator...
the
dredge
is
there
to
do
construction
work.
it
is
there
to
dredge.
the
casino
is
there
to
have
people
gamble
and
serve
them
drinks.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
it
is
our
position...
and
as
stated
by
some
of
the
first
circuit...
that
the
movement
of
the
dredge
was
incidental.
once--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
this
court
handled
that
in
wilander,
your
honor,
that
it
said
in--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--if
the
term,
your
honor,
in
navigation,
had
the
bite
that
i
think
it
should
have,
then
we
may
not
be
here
today
at
all.
the
first
circuit
was
actually
looking
at
the
actual
transportation
function,
assuming
that
it
had
to
be
into
navigation.
what
the...
what
the
petitioner
wants
is
1
u.s.c.,
section
3
which
looks
at
theoretical
transportation,
a
mere
capability.
and
your
honor,
i
understand
what
you
said,
justice
scalia,
that
to
you,
they're
the
same,
practical
capability
or
capability.
but
to
the
petitioner
and
the
government,
they
are
far
different.
in
both
of
their
briefs,
they
have
said
that
without
the
evansville
change
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
adds
practical
capability,
both
have
agreed
that
it
is
overly
inclusive
a
statute,
1
u.s.c.,
section
3.
it
includes
everything
and
including
justice
breyer's
garage
door.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
perils
of
the
sea,
which
this
court
discussed
at
length
in
the
papai
case,
we...
we
say
that...
that
is
further
evidence
that
mr.
stewart
is
not
entitled
to
jones
act
remedies.
mr.
stewart
was
on
a
construction
site.
it
happened
to
be
a
work
platform
in
site
of
land.
he
was
never
more
than
500
yards
off
the
coast.
the
dangers
that
he
was
up
against
were
more
akin
to
that
of
a
construction
worker
or,
at
the
very
least,
a
harbor
worker
or
a
stevedore.
they
were
not
the
same
perils
that
are
normally
faced
by
a
true
seaman.
now--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
this
was
a
situation
where
the
super
scoop
was...
was
moored.
it
was
anchored
and
stationary,
again
as
a
stationary
work
platform.
the
scow
was
just
being
brought
from
one
side
to
the
other
alongside...
attached
to
it
at
all
time
by...
by
cables
and
by
the
crane.
the...
the...
he
got
jostled
and
he
fell.
no
different
than
harbor
workers
and
stevedores
face
everyday
when
they're
unloading
ships
and
working
on
harbors.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
they
would
have
sent
everyone
home.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
because
we
are
in
the
protected
harbors
of
the...
of
boston
harbor--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--that
happened
a
week
ago.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
your--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
in
that...
in
that...
using
your
hypothetical,
it's
a
construction
platform
right
off
the
coast.
they'd
send
everyone
home.
if
there
was
any
trouble
with
the
sea,
the...
the
greatest
perils
that
are
discussed
in
the
petitioner's
brief...
and
they
list
them
all...
one
of
them
is
isolation
and
far
away
from
home
and
far
from
aid.
those
don't
apply
to
mr.
stewart.
mr.
stewart
would
be
sent
home
if
there
was
too
much...
the
weather
got
bad.
he
would
be
sent
home
in
a...
in
a
minute
or
2.
he
lived
right
in
boston.
he
was
in
the
middle
of
a
large
city.
there
was
no
major
danger
of
isolation.
that...
the
super
scoop
was
inspected
regularly
by
the
state,
federal,
and
government
officials
and
by
the
general
contractor
on
the
job.
there
was
no
isolation.
all
of
the
perils
that
have
been
listed
by--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--the
coast
guard
also.
i'm
not
sure
they
went
out
on
a
regular
basis,
but
they
did
inspect
the...
the
super
scoop
at...
at
some
point.
there's
no
question
about
that.
this
court--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--oh,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
this
court
in
cope
and
earlier
cases
has
long
equated
a
vessel
with
transportation.
that's
what
the
first
circuit
did.
they...
they
needed
a
bright
line.
they
chose
a
bright
line,
and
the
bright
line
was
transportation.
is
the
structure
primarily
engaged
in
transportation
or
commerce?
and
navigation,
transportation,
and
commerce
are
all
intermixed,
and...
and
the
definitions
include
each
other.
and
they
found
that
it
was
not
primarily
engaged
in
transportation.
it
was
primarily
a
work
platform
doing
construction.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
what
it
is,
i
believe,
is
a
bright
line
test
with
an
exception.
and
the
stewart
case
talked
about
the
digiovanni
exception,
which
falls
very
closely
to...
to
what
justice
stevens
wrote
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
chandris
case,
that
it
is
unfair
that
somebody
who
was
actually
injured
while
a...
a
vessel
or...
or
structure
is
in
actual
navigation
does
not
get
at
least
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
and
that
that
person
cannot
be...
said
to
be
a
jones
act
seaman.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
at
no
time
during
the
1
and
a
half
years
that
mr.
stewart
was
in
the
harbor,
as
far
as
we
know
from
the
record,
was
the
super
scoop
in
transportation.
the
incidental
movement
of...
of
pulling
forward
a
few
feet
with
its
anchors
is
not
navigation
or
transport...
transportation.
the
first
circuit
stated
that
the
movement
of
the
scow
was
both
immaterial
because,
as
the
government
has
already
admitted,
he
wasn't
tied
to
the
scow.
his...
his
time
was
spent
on
the
super
scoop,
but
also
incidental,
your
honor,
because
it
was
just
slight
movement
along
the
site.
it
wasn't
transportation
or
navigation.
at
no
point...
and...
and
the
petitioner
has
put
their
spin
on
this
that...
stating
that
mr.
stewart
every
day
he
was
out
there
moved
in
and
out
of
coverage.
that's
not
true.
he
was
never
in
jones
act
coverage.
and
your
honor--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--i
think
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
it's...
it's
a
closer
call,
that
they--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--that
is
a
traditional
trip...
ship
and
those
people
are
engaged
in
a
form
of
transport--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--in
that
situation,
your
honor,
it
would
be...
it
would
be
a
primary
purpose,
though,
that
transporting
the
people
who
happen
to
be
gambling--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--well,
in
the
first
circuit--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--well,
in
the
manuel
court,
the
fifth
circuit
actually
uses
the
term,
a
primary
purpose.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
and...
and
i
think...
and
to
a
degree
that--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--it's
an...
it's
an
oxymoron,
your
honor.
but
what...
what
the
first
circuit
was
doing
in...
in
the
stewart
case
is...
is
similar
to
what
this
court
did
in
chandris.
it
was
looking
at
a
temporal
view.
a
worker...
and
the
temporal
view
used
by
this
court
in
chandris
was
looking
at
what
the
worker
was
doing.
what
were
his
duties?
he
isn't
going
to
be
denied
jones
act
coverage
because
he
happened
to
be
an
office
worker
2
months
before
if
his
duties
had
changed
and
he
was
now
a
jones
act
seaman,
nor
if
he
fell
in
the
office,
after
he
had
been
reassigned
to
the
office,
was
he
going
to
gain
jones
act
seaman
status
just
because
he
spent
the
last
2
years
on
the
vessel.
that
is
what
the
first
circuit
has
done
in
terms
of
the
vessel
as
well,
not
just
the
work
but
in
terms
of
the
vessel.
do
not
look
at
what
this
vessel
did
in
the
past.
do
not
look
at
what
it
did...
might
do
in
the...
in
the
future.
it's
transportation
from
california
through
the
panama
canal
up
the
east
coast
is
immaterial.
you
should
look
at
the
worker
who
is
claiming
jones
act
status,
his
relationship
to
the
structure
and
what
the
structure's
purpose
was
and
business
was
during
that
relationship.
during
the
1
and
a
half
years
that
he
was
associated
with
it,
it
wasn't
transporting
anything.
it
was
used
as
a...
a
work
platform
only,
only
a
structure,
and
it
wasn't
transporting
anything
during
that
time.
the
same
thing
with
the
casino
boats,
these
individuals
who
go
upon
the
casinos
as
a
waitress
and
are
never...
never
leave
the
port,
never
leave
the
dock
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
the
special
protections
of
the
jones
act.
they
face
none
of
the
perils
of...
of
the
sea
or
of...
of
perils
of...
of
navigation.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
decided,
i
believe
it
was
in
chandris,
that
a...
a
seaman
doesn't
lose
his
seaman
status
just
because
the
vessel
he's
assigned
to
is
now
in...
in
port.
they
wanted...
they
didn't
want
a
person
to
go
in
and
out
too
many--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
of
course,
the
ultimate
issue
the
court
is
trying
to
arrive
at
is
whether
or
not
mr.
stewart
is
a
jones
act
seaman.
and
this
court
has
held
for
him
to
be
a
jones
act
seaman,
it
must
be
a
vessel
in
navigation.
i
don't
think
that
that
can
be
separated,
that
just
looking
at
a
vessel.
1
u.s.c.,
section
3,
which
the
petitioner
wishes,
of
course,
everything...
everything
that
floats
that
is
capable
of
transportation
is...
is
a
vessel.
the
first
circuit
has...
has
used
a
much
more
narrow
definition
but
focusing
on
the
purpose
and
primary
use
of
the
structure
because
it
is
trying
to
get
to
where
this
court
was
trying
to
get.
is
it
a
vessel
in
navigation?
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
well,
again,
your
honor,
if...
if
in
navigation
means
what
it
should
mean,
which
is
an
instrument
for
transportation
or
commerce
over
navigable
waters,
and
not
simply
as
the
petitioner
and
the
government
want
it
to
mean
that
anything
that
once
might
have
been
in
navigable
waters
and
stays
in
navigable
waters
and
isn't
mothballed
is
still
in
navigation...
if
it
means
what
it
should
mean,
then
that's
something
i
think
the
first
circuit
is...
was
trying
to
get
to
anyway.
they...
they
were
looking
at
it
in
terms
of
vessel
status,
vessel
in
navigation
versus
just
in
navigation.
they...
they
were
trying
to
get
there
and
that's
why
they
used
what
is
really
a...
a
temporal
look
and
looked
at
what
was
the
business
use.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
the
first
circuit
does...
the
first
circuit
rule,
your
honor,
in
digiovanni
and
fall
and
stewart
does
have
a
snapshot
exception.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
there's
the
main
rule
which
has
a
bright
line--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
there...
there
are
always...
and
this
is
answering
justice
ginsburg's
question
earlier
as
well.
there
are
always
going
to
be
difficult
situations
where
some
people,
doing
the
exact
same
work,
using
the
same
equipment
on
the
same
structure,
some
are
covered
and
some
are
not,
a
situation
where
one
has
the
requisite
connection
30
or
40
percent
to
a
vessel,
the
other
person
doing
the
same
work
next
to
him
only
has
10
percent.
one
is
covered.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
your
honor,
again,
i...
i
think
that
if
1
u.s.c.,
section
3
is
adopted,
then
every
vessel
capable--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--well,
i
don't...
i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
the
way...
the
way
we
look
at
the
congressional
intent...
this
court
has
already
decided
in...
in
several
cases
that
congress
left
it
to
the
court
to
decide
which
persons
are...
should
be
granted
jones
act
seaman
status.
this
is
what
the
court
has
said.
why
then
would
the
congress
in...
in
the
same
statutes
have
sort
of
handcuffed
the
court
by
saying
it's
for
you
to
decide
who's
a
jones
act
seaman
and
who's
entitled
to
those
special
protections,
but
we're
going
to
handcuff
you
and...
and
say
this
is
what
you
have
to
decide
as
far
as
vessel
is
concerned?
1
u.s.c.,
section
3
was
not
followed.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
petitioner
is
a
recent
convert
to
this
position,
and
it...
it
hasn't
been
followed
in
the
circuits
at
all.
there
isn't
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
where
a
lot
of
circuit
judges
have
stated
section
3
should
be
the
definition
for
the
jones
act.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
jones
act--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--it
is
pursuant
to
what...
the
petitioner
and
the
government's
view.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
my
view
is
that
it
shouldn't
be,
that
it
should
have
some
bite
to
it.
it
should
mean,
as...
as
i
stated
before,
an
instrument
of
commerce
or
transportation
over
navigable
waters.
but
that's
not
what
it
has
come
to
mean
in
a
lot
of
the
circuits
below.
it
has
come
to
mean
something
that's
just
simply
in
navigable
waters
no
matter
how
many
years
it
has
gone
without--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--i
have
never
thought
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
in
that
in
that
situation,
there
are...
there
can
be
vessels
involved
with
transportation,
getting
back
to
the
cope
case
and
other
cases,
where
there...
it's...
it's
a
barge
being
towed,
but
it's
transporting
things.
we're
not
disputing
that.
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
have
a
captain
and
crew
necessarily
to
be
a...
considered
a
vessel
in
navigation.
but
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head,
your
honor,
and
that's...
that's
where
the
first
circuit
was
befuddled
in...
in
trying
to
come
up
with
a
regional...
reasonable
test
because
they're
dealing
with
this
situation
where
it
seemed
like
everything
is
a
vessel
in
navigation.
and
yet,
that
doesn't
serve
congress'
intent
of
only
persons
who
face
the
perils
of
the
sea
are
entitled
to
the
special
protections
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
correct.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
because
this
court
effectively
overruled
the
definition
or
decided
not
to
use
it
in
the
evansville
case.
it
saw
in
that
case
that
it
would
not
just
rely
on
the
section
3
language.
it
would
add
the
word
practically,
practically
capable,
and...
and
not
just
capable
because
the
court
saw
that
in
evansville
the
wharfboat,
which
they
determined
was
not
a
vessel,
even
though
again
not
dealing
with
the
jones
act,
it
was
capable
of
transportation,
but
it
wasn't
practically
capable
of
transportation.
so
the--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--the
court
has
decided--
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
--not
to
follow
section
3.
mr.
frederick
e.
connelly,
jr.
your
honor...
and
i
realize
that
is
what
justice
scalia
said
earlier.
the
position
of
the
petitioner,
as
he
stated
as
he
was
standing
here
not
too
many
minutes
ago,
was
that
they
seek
to
have
the
court
employ
1
u.s.c.,
section
3,
not
the
evansville
change
to
that
section.
they...
they
see
it
as
quite
different
and
it's
in
both
of
their
briefs,
that
evansville
did
change
1
u.s.c.,
section
3.
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
this
court
is
bound
by...
to
follow
1
u.s.c.,
section
3
because
congress
says
so.
it
is
our
position
that
they're
not
so
bound.
if
you're
bound...
if
you're
not
bound,
why
take
a
faulty
definition
such
as
section
3
and
try
to
change
it
a
little
bit?
you're...
you're
free
to
as...
as
you
are,
to
determine
who
is
a
jones
act
seaman.
you're
free
to
determine
what
is
a
vessel
in
navigation
or
a
vessel
pertaining
to
the...
the
jones
act.
1
u.s.c.,
section
3
was
never
referenced
in
the
longshore
act.
congress
at
that
time,
many
years
before
and
many
years
after,
has
passed
many
statutes
in
which
vessel
is
defined.
sometimes
they
reference
section
3;
other
times
they
write
in
a
definition.
sometimes
it's
similar
to
section
3,
sometimes
quite
different.
in
this
case...
for
the
longshore
act,
they
decided
to
leave
it
to
the
courts.
the
jones
act
was
passed
in
1920.
its
predecessor
was
the
act
of
1915.
that
act
did
have
a
definition
of
vessel
that
was
very
restrictive
and
actually
talked
about
actual
navigation.
in
1920,
the
merchant
marine
act
was
passed
and
it...
that
portion
of
it
had
a
very
large
definition,
which
was
already
discussed
earlier,
the
shipping
act
definition.
the
jones
act
didn't
adopt
that
one
and
it
didn't
adopt
the
one
in
1915.
the...
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act
was
passed
in
1927.
certainly
by
that
point
they
knew
that
they
had
just
jettisoned
two
definitions
7
years
before.
they
chose
again
to
leave
it
to
the
courts.
in
1972
and
again
in
1984,
there
were
considerable
amendments
that
congress
did
to
the
longshore
act.
at
that
time,
they
certainly
knew...
and
there's
always
been
heavy...
heavy
lobbying
going
on
in
congress
every
time
that
they
try
to
touch
the
longshore
act
or...
or
the
jones
act.
they
knew
by
that
point
in
time
that
the
circuits
were
not
using
section
3
as
the
definition
for
jones
act
vessel.
again,
they
chose
to
leave
it
to
the
courts.
they
did
not
intercede
and
then
reference
section
3
or
incorporate
a
definition
like
it
or
something.
they
again
chose
not
to.
in
1920,
section
3
was
certainly
not
the
only
definition
of
vessel.
benedict
on
admiralty,
which
this
court
has
cited
several
times,
which
the
petitioner
has
cited,
had
a
completely
different
definition
of...
of
vessel,
and
that
could
have
been
the
one
that
congress
had
in
mind.
i
realize
it's
always
dangerous
to
mention
the
congressional
record,
but
most
of
the
people
who
spoke
in
1920
and
again
in...
mainly
in
1927
were
discussing
traditional
vessels
and
vessels
on
a
voyage.
if
they
had
true
seamen
in
mind,
they
probably
had
more
of
a
traditional
vessel
in
mind.
also
looking
at
the
record,
when
the
house
wanted
to
include
everybody,
all
seamen,
into
the
longshore
act,
they
listed
out
various
structures
such
as
dredges
and
barges.
obviously,
a
compromise
was
reached
with
the
senate,
and
when
the
act
was
passed,
they
limited
it,
not
just
seamen
and...
and
but
only
to
masters
and
members
of
crews
of
vessels.
they
limited
it
to
that
and
left
it,
of
course,
to
the
courts
to
decide
who
is
entitled
to
the
jones
act
status.
if
i
may
have
a
second,
your
honor.
the
term
vessel
can
and
often
has
had
a
different
meaning
for
the
jones
act,
which
this
court
has
stated
is
a
vessel
in
navigation,
than
it
does
with
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act.
in
his
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
mr.
hillsman
writes
that
the
lower
court
unanimously...
unanimously...
have
decided
that
the
definition
of
vessel
for
purposes
of
the
longshore
act
is
much,
much
more
inclusive
than
it
is
for
the
jones
act,
and
it
has
worked
perfectly
fine.
under
the
longshore
act,
most
of
the
persons
who
collect
longshore
benefits
only
have
to
show
it's
a
maritime
nexus.
there's
no
vessel
requirement
from
almost
all
of
the
claims
under
the
longshore
act.
another
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
both
the
first
circuit
and
the
petitioner
talked
about
a
bright
line
test.
the
first
circuit,
though,
test
is
dealing
with
actual
transportation,
the
actual
use
in
business
of
the
structure
during
the
time
that
the
person
who
is
claiming
special
status
is
associated
with
it.
more
confusing
is
dealing
with
1
u.s.c.,
section
3,
which
although
bright
is
also
very
broad
and
would
include
everything.
anything
that
floats
or
is
capable
of
floating
would
be
included
under
that.
there
are
always
going
to
be
situations,
no
matter
what
definition
the
court
comes
up
with...
always
situations
where
a
person
would
have
to
be
covered
under
both
acts,
and
i
realize
in
the
chandris
case,
it
was
the
goal
of
the
court
to
say
we'd
like
to
make
it
clear
as
we...
we
can.
we
don't
want
people
going
in
and
out
of
jones
act
status.
however,
as
this
court
saw
in
gizoni,
a
perfect
example...
in
gizoni,
the
person
was
a
harbor
worker.
this
court
sent
it
back
to
the
lower
court
saying...
the
lower
court
had
said
you're
a
harbor
worker.
that's
your
label.
you're
in
the
harbor
workers'
union.
you're
not
entitled
to...
for
jones
act
status.
this
court
said
no,
send
it
back,
let's
take
another
look.
the
person,
although
a
harbor
worker,
may
have
had
the
requisite
connections
to
a
vessel
in
navigation
to
be
able
to
claim
jones
act
seaman
status.
obviously,
in
that
situation,
which
is
a
perfect
example,
the...
the
employer
would
have
had
to
cover
him
under
the
longshore
act
and
if...
if
the
lower
court
changes
or...
or
the
jury
decides
that
he's
a
jones
act
seaman,
would
have
had
to
have
covered
him
under
the
jones
act.
professor
schoenbaum
has
said
that
the
mutual
exclusivity
of
the
two
acts
is
really
in
theory
only
and
that
there
are
always
cases
and
will
be
dealing
with
the
brown
water
seamen
and
brown
water
employees,
harbor
workers
and
longshoremen,
where
they're
going
to
have
to
be
covered
under
both
anyway.
again,
the
first
circuit
test,
which
does
have
an
exception
to
it,
which
it
clearly
is...
is
a
snapshot,
again
to
give
someone
another
bite
at
the
apple,
which
this
court
thought,
at
least
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
chandris,
was
a
fair
result,
has
that.
but
the
test
itself
is...
is
broad.
it...
it
is
a
bright
line
and
it
makes
it
clear,
as
this
court
has
stated
in
the
past,
that
unless
there's
a
transportation
function,
it's
not
a
vessel
in
navigation.
thank
you.
