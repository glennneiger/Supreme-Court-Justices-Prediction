justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
that...
that
definition,
used
or
capable
of
being
used...
right,
now.
after
one
of
the
hurricanes,
i
saw
a...
a
tugboat
that
had
just
been
washed
up
on
shore
down
in
the
gulf.
what
if
somebody...
some
enterprising
person
had
fitted
that
out
like
a...
like
a
diner,
you
know,
a...
a
restaurant
and
they
have
staff
in
the
diner
and
they're
serving
the
meals
off
of
this
boat?
now,
the
boat,
apart
from
the
fact
that
it's
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
inland,
is
capable
of
being...
still
capable
of
being
used.
are
the
employees
of
that
diner
covered
by
the
jones
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
goes
to
whether
we
want
to
use,
you
know,
section
3
as...
as
our
definition.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
it
is
a
vessel.
i
thought
your
answer
before
was
that
it
was
not
a
vessel
because
it's
not
practically
capable
of
being
used.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
like
justice
ginsburg's
answer
better.
[laughter]
it
is
a
vessel
but
it's
not
in
navigation.
then
you
could
stick
with
the...
with
the
section
3
definition.
it's
capable
of
being
used,
so
it's
a
vessel,
but
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--precisely?
so
then
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you...
you
think
that
the
person
who
operates
the
dredge,
since
he's
not
navigating
the
vessel,
is
not
covered
by
the
jones
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not
what?
do
not
think
he's
covered
by
the
jones
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
covered.
well,
then
why
isn't
the
croupier
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
croupier
covered,
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
vessel's
function
is
gambling.
he
sure
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
have
a
very
complicated
dredge
and
it
takes
two
people?
one
of
them
does
nothing
but...
but
operate
the
steam
shovel
that
pulls
up
the
goop
and
puts
it
in
the...
in
the
barges.
okay?
and
the
other
one
moves
the
dredge.
you
say
the
one
is...
is
covered
by
the
jones
act
and
the
other
one
isn't?
no,
it
can't
be.
if
the
function
of
the
vessel
is
dredging,
anybody
who
is
performing
that
function
of
dredging
is
covered
by
the
jones
act.
don't
you
believe
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
do.
so
the
croupier
is--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
easy.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
not
even
close.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
carries
all
this
goop
somewhere
else
to...
to
dump
it.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
reading
anything
in?
i
mean,
do...
do
you
think
if...
if
you
were
not
practically
capable,
you
would
be
capable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
regard
that
as
a
reading
in
at
all.
i
mean,
capable
means
capable.
you're
either
capable
or
not.
if
you
practically
can't
be
moved,
your
not
capable.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
goes
to
in
navigation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
to
whether
it's
a
vessel
or
not.
it
is
still
a
vessel
even
if
it's
beached
up
on
land
so
long
as
it
is
capable
of...
of
floating.
it's
just
not
in
navigation,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
think
what
the
government
has
said
is
that
though
it's
in
navigation,
we
have
a
case
that
says
that
the...
that
the
seaman's
connection
to
the
ship
has
to
be
related
to
the
functioning
of
the
ship
in
navigation.
he
doesn't
have
to
navigate
it,
but
he
has
to
be
working
at
what
the
ship
does
in
the
course
of
its
navigation,
and
a
dredge
operator
does
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
to
the
navigating
part
but
to
what
the
vessel
is
doing
in
the
course
of
its
being
in
navigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
happens
every...
every
86
years
they
have
one
of
these
storms.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
guess
i
could
agree
with
you
if...
if
i
believed
that
i
had
to
look
to
the
primary
purpose,
whether
the
primary
purpose
of
the
vessel
was
transportation.
but
what...
what
do
you
do
about
gambling
ships
that,
you
know,
they...
they
sail
out
beyond
the
2-mile
limit
and
then
come
right
back
to
where
they
left?
now,
people
get
on
board
not
to
get
transported.
they
get
on
board
to
gamble.
and
the
purpose
of
the
ship,
the
primary
purpose
of
the
ship,
is
gambling.
you
think
that...
that...
the...
the
seamen
who...
who
are
on
that
ship,
which
regularly
goes
out
beyond
the
2-mile
limit,
you
think
that
they're...
that
they're
not
covered
by
the
jones
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
close
at
all.
i
think
they're
obviously
covered
by
the
jones
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
that's
not
the
primary
purpose
of...
of
the
ship,
just
as
the
primary
purpose
of
this
scow
is...
of...
of
this
dredge
is
not
transportation.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
a
primary
purpose?
now,
you're
getting
a
little
fuzzy
there.
i
thought
you
said
the
primary
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
a
primary
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
not
fuzzy.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it...
is
it
the
vessel
that's
the
problem?
why...
why
do
you
focus
on
the
vessel?
it
seems
to
me
most
of
your
argument
has
gone
to
whether
it's
in
navigation.
can
you
be
a
vessel
that
is
not
in
navigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
can
or
you
wouldn't
have
the...
the
combination
of
the
two
terms
appearing
anywhere.
so
why
isn't
the
problem
here
not
whether
it's
a
vessel
but
whether
it's
in
navigation?
