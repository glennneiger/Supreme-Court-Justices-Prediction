justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
rather
strange
to
me.
if
you
take
him
to
the
airport,
he
either
gets
off
the
plane
or
he
doesn't.
i
don't
see
why
you
litigate
that.
you
know
whether
they'll
accept
him
or
not
when
you...
when
you
deliver
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
make...
can
i
interrupt
here?
i
want
to
ask
the
question
i
started
before.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
if
you
read
this
as
a
mandatory
requirement,
the
attorney
general
shall
do
it,
and
if
you
assume
an
existing
government...
now,
you
narrowed
the
question.
so
i'm
not
talking
about
the
question.
if
there's
an
existing
government,
he
cannot
command
the
other
government
to
accept
the
alien.
the
general
practice
among
nations
was
they
would
not...
the
other
nation
has
an
obligation
to
accept
people
back.
but
if
they
won't
do
it,
we
can't
force
them
to
take
the
person
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how...
how
could...
say
you
send
a
person
back
to
great
britain
and
they
say
we're
not
going
to
take
him.
how
are
you...
what...
what
can...
what
could
the
attorney
general
possibly
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
word
shall
cannot
mean
shall
because
he...
he
cannot
in
every
case
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
there's
acceptance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just...
let
me
get
an
answer
to
my
question.
in
your...
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
the
mandatory...
it
imposes
a
mandatory
duty
on
the
attorney
general
which
he
may
not
be
able
to
perform
because
he
may
not
be
able
to
repatriate
the
alien
unless
the
other
country
will
accept
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
it's
an
exception
to
subparagraph
(iv).
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
reading
the
language
in
subparagraph
(vii)
as
a...
an
exception
to
subparagraph
(iv).
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
at
(e).
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
saying
if
you
read
(e)
your
way,
subsection
(iv)
is
a
mandatory
command
to
the
attorney
general
that
he
may
not
be
able
to
carry
out
unless
he
can
comply
with
subsection
(vii).
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
shall
remove.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
can
choose
one
of
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wouldn't
it
always
be
impossible
if...
if
the...
if
the
other
country
will
not
accept
the
alien?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
rather
have
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
scalia
has
two
opinions
to
announce.
