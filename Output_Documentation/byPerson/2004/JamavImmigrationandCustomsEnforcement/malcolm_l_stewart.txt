mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plain
language
of
8
u.s.c.
1231(b)(2)(e)(iv)
authorizes
removal
of
an
alien
to
his
country
of
birth,
and
it
is
undisputed
that
petitioner
was
born
in
somalia.
by
its
terms
the
statutory
authorization
is
not
conditioned
on
acceptance
by
the
receiving
country's
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we...
we
narrowed
it
in
that
way
because
we
feel
that
that's
the
only
question
that
is
squarely
before
this
court.
that
is,
the
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we've
also
indicated
that
the...
the
logical
thrust
of
most
of
our
arguments
is
to
the
effect
that
an
individual
could
be
removed
to
an
otherwise
permissible
country,
notwithstanding
the
lack
of
acceptance
of
a
functioning
central
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
somalia
is
the
only
one,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
obviously
we...
we
opposed
the
certiorari
petition.
so
we're
not
contending
that
the
practical
importance
of
the
question
is
such
that
it
would
necessarily
justify
the
court's
expenditure
of
its
resources.
there
was
a
square
circuit
conflict--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
our...
the
reason...
one
of
the
reasons
we
framed
the
question
as
we
did
is
that
petitioner's
last
argument
in
the
brief
was,
as
we
read
it,
to
the
effect
that
whatever
the
text
of
the
statute
might
say,
there
has
been
an
established
understanding
over
the
decades
that
removal
is
not
permitted
in
the
absence
of
acceptance
by
the
receiving
country's
government.
and
part
of
the
point
we
wanted
to
make
is
we
don't
think
an
understanding
of
that
sort
could
trump
the
test...
the
text.
but
even
if
the
court
decided
that
the
established
understanding
was
so
pervasive
that
an
extratextual
limitation
on
removal
authority
should
be
read
in,
the
understanding
could
be
thought
to
exist
only
in
cases
where
there
was
a
functioning
central
government
that
resisted
the
alien's
return.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
without--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--although--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
do...
i
think
you
left
out
one
word
that
is...
is
crucial,
that
is,
his
position
necessarily
turns
on
the
proposition
that
we
have
to
get
acceptance
not
simply
from
the
country,
but
from
the
government
of
that
country.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
we
would
submit--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
first,
we
would...
we
would
submit
that
the
question
presented
presupposes
that
somalia
is
a
country.
but
leaving
that
question
aside,
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
good
reasons
that
even
if
the
court
felt
this
issue
was
properly
before
it,
it
should
hold
that
somalia
is
a
country.
if
you
go
to
the
department
of
state
web
site,
somalia
is
listed
as
an
independent
state.
it
continues
to
be
a
member
state
in
the
united
nations,
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
a
functioning
central
government.
if
somalia
were
not
regarded
as
a
country
or
a
state,
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
a
government,
then
presumably
all
people
who
were
formerly
somali
nationals
would
now
be
rendered
stateless,
and
that's
a
result
that
international
law
generally--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we're
saying
that...
we're
saying,
first,
that
antarctica
and
somalia
are
countries.
it's
exceedingly--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
extremely
unlikely
that...
that
the...
the
text
of
a
statute
could
ever
be
satisfied
because
the
permitted
removal
countries
are
countries
such
as
the
country
in
which--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
so
in
any
event,
we...
we
think
that
somalia
is
a
country.
it
continues
to
be
regarded
as
such,
notwithstanding
the
current
lack
of
existence
of
a
functioning
central
government.
there
is
a
portion
of
somaliland...
of
somalia
known
as
somaliland
that
has
set
up
its
own
government
and
characterizes
itself
as
a
separate
country,
but
the
united
states
government
has
not
recognized
that
claim,
nor
has
any
other
country.
so
somalia
for
these
purposes
remains
intact.
i'd
like
to
focus
again
on
the
text
of
the
relevant
statutory
provisions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
know
what
ultimately
happened
to
the
alien.
as
the
case
is
described
in
the
amicus
brief,
the
alien
was
flown
to
ethiopia.
he
was
refused
at
the
border,
and
then
he
was
flown
back.
and
i
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
our
representation
that
we
have
not
historically
attempted
to
repatriate
aliens
over
the
objection
of
a
functioning
central
government.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
a
measure
of
inconvenience
if
he's
flown
there
and
back,
but
we
would
say
that
even
if
the
court
held
that
the
statute
requires
acceptance
by
the
receiving
country's
government,
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
us
to
obtain
a
prior
assurance
of
acceptance.
rather,
it
would
still
be
a
permissible
option
for
us
to
fly
the
alien
to
the
border,
and
if
the
people
there,
having
been
told
who
he
is,
let
in
him,
we
would
say
that
falls--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm...
i'm
sorry.
fly
him
to
the
port
of
entry
at
which
he
would
be
presented
to
the...
the
immigration
or
customs
officials
in
the
relevant
foreign
country,
and
if
they
acceded
to
his
entry,
having
been
apprised
of
who
he
was,
we
would
say
that
constitutes
acceptance
by
the
receiving
country's
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
i
mean,
here...
here
the
barrier...
in
a
sense,
the
barrier
is
not
so
much
acceptance.
that
is,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
order
to
accomplish
removal
of
an
alien
to
somalia,
we're
going
to
put
him
on
a
plane.
he
is
going
to
be
flown
at
an
airport
in
somalia,
and
there
will
be
people
at
the
airport
with
guns
presumably
who
exercise
de
facto
control
over
who
gets
in
and
who
is
not
allowed
to
deplane.
and
if
those
people
are
not
willing
to
let
mr.
jama
into
the
country,
he'll
be
flown
back
and
we
won't
be
able
to
accomplish
repatriation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the...
the
barrier...
the
potential
barrier
is
not
that
there
won't
be
acceptance,
that
there...
but
that
there
won't
be
acceptance--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
won't
be
acceptance
by
people
that
we
would
regard
as
the
government
of
somalia.
and...
and
i
think
there
is
a
significant
point
here
in
terms
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
that
is,
if
the
reconciliation
process
goes
as
we
hope
and
conditions
in
somalia
become
more
stable,
the...
the
people
who
purport
to
exercise
governmental
authority
gain
control
over
the...
the
territory
and
the
consent
of
the
population,
at
a
certain
point
the
state
department
will
have
to
make
a
decision,
have
things
progressed
far
enough
that
we
can
characterize
this
as
the
government
of
somalia.
and
that
determination
shouldn't
be
skewed
by
a
judicial
ruling
that
until
the
state
department
makes
that
determination,
repatriation
of
aliens
to
that
country
will
be
prohibited.
if
i
could
turn
to
the...
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
provision
on
which
we
rely,
of
course,
is...
is
subsection
(e)(iv)
and
that's
at
page
4
of
the
government's
brief,
and
it's
headed
additional
removal
countries.
it
says,
if
an
alien
is
not
removed
to
a
country
under
the
previous
subparagraphs
of
this
paragraph,
the
attorney
general...
now
the
secretary
of
homeland
security...
shall
remove
the
alien
to
any
of
the
following
countries.
and
roman
(iv)
is
the
country
in
which
the
alien
was
born.
by
its
terms,
that
gives
unqualified
approval
to
removal
to
the
country
of
birth.
neither
the
introductory
language
nor
subsection...
or
clause
(iv)
itself
conditions
that
authorization
on
acceptance
by
the
receiving
country's
government.
and
it's
also--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
let
me...
let
me
turn
the
court
first
to
page
3
of
the
government's
brief
that
has
the
text
of
current
subsection
(d),
and
i
think
that
maybe
that
will
help
me
to
explain
it
best
because
the
way
we
would
formulate
our
interpretation
of
subsection
(d)
is
very
slightly
different
from
the
way
that...
that
you
characterized
it
earlier.
subsection
(d)
says:
if
an
alien
is
not
removed
to
a
country
designated
under
subparagraph
(a)(i),
the
attorney
general
shall
remove
the
alien
to
a
country
of
which
the
alien
is
a
subject,
national,
or
citizen
unless
the
government
of
the
country
fails
to
give
its
consent.
and
our
interpretation
of
the
purpose
of
subsection
(d)
is
it
expresses
a
strong
preference
for
removal
to
the
country
of
nationality,
assuming
that
no
designation
has
been
made.
but
congress
recognized
that
to
make
that
an
absolute
requirement,
even
in
circumstances
where
there
was
no
acceptance,
would
embroil
the
executive
branch
into
foreign
policy
confrontations
because
essentially
even
when
the
executive
branch
officials
believed
it
would
be
an
unwarranted
affront
to
foreign
states
to
try
to
remove
in
the
face
of
foreign
resistance,
the
statute,
without
the
exception,
would
be
telling
the
attorney
general
you
have
to
do
that.
and
so
congress,
understandably,
enacted
an...
an
exception
to
that
requirement,
and
it
says
if
there
is
no
acceptance,
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
to
remove.
now,
we
would...
we
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we...
we
would
say
he
has
discretion,
but
he...
but
he
has--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
agree
that
that
is
generally
the
international
practice.
now,
i
would...
i
would
not
categorically
promise--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
as
a
practical
matter
in
that
context,
it
would
be
impossible.
but
to
take
another
hypothetical
situation--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
says
he
shall
do
it
unless--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right.
unless
there's
acceptance.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
remember.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
first--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
first,
there
were
only
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
that
we've
been
pointed
to
in
which
the
attempt
remove
an
alien
was
actually
thwarted
on
the
basis
that
there
had
been
a
no
acceptance
by
the
receiving
country's
government.
second,
learned
hand
was
unquestionably
a
distinguished
judge,
but
if
he
had
been
infallible,
then
presumably
he
would
have
been
on
this
court.
[laughter]
and
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
i
think...
and
i
think...
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly,
exactly,
exactly,
exactly.
the...
the
point
is
for
this
court
to
treat
as
any
lower
court
opinion
as
an
authoritative
statement
of
what
the
law
means
or
meant
would
be
an
inversion
of
our
judicial--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
our...
our
point
is
that
the
statute
would
have
raised
that
concern
if
the
exception
were
not
there.
that
is,
if
the
statute
said
in
terms
if
there
is
no
removal
to
the
country
designated,
the
attorney
general
shall
remove
the
alien
to
his
country
of
citizenship
or
nationality
and
didn't
include
an
exception,
then
the
attorney
general
would
be
placed
in
a
situation,
at
least
potentially,
where
he
was
forced...
he
felt
himself
forced
by
law
to
attempt
repatriation
even
though
he
knew
that
the
government
of
that
country
didn't
accept
the
alien's
return.
and
it
was
to
prevent
that
sort
of
foreign
policy
confrontation
that
the
exception
was
written
in.
the
exception
was,
by
its
terms,
an
exception
to
a
mandate.
it
was
not
intended
to
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
an
exception
to
subparagraph
(iv)...
to
subparagraph--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
i'm
reading
the
language
of
subsection
(d).
i'm...
i'm
not
at
(e).
i'm
at
subsection
(d).
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
okay.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we're
not
saying
that
subsection
(e)(iv)
is
a
mandate
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
secretary
must
remove
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
says
shall
remove
to
one
of
the
following
countries,
but
it
clearly
is
not
intended
to
be
a
mandate
because
the
introductory--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
introductory...
he
doesn't
have
to
choose
one
because
the
introductory
language
of
roman
(vii)
says,
if
impracticable,
inadvisable,
or
impossible
to
remove
the
alien,
dot,
dot,
dot.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
so
it
specifically
contemplates
the
possibility
that
situations
may
arise
in
which
it
will
not
be
practicable,
possible,
or
advisable
to
remove
the
alien
to
any
of
the
foregoing
countries.
and
certainly
one--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think...
i
mean,
to...
to
give
a
slight
variance
on
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
posed,
if
a
future--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
would
not
always
be
impossible.
if,
for
instance,
a
future
president
of
mexico
embarked
on
an
aggressive
program
of
encouraging
aliens...
encouraging
mexican
nationals
to
leave
that
country
illegally,
and
then
the
mexican
government
refused
to
take
them
back,
i
think
it
would
at
least
be
possible.
it
would
be
an
option
the
president
would
want
to
consider
to
repatriate
those
people
over
the
objection
of
the
mexican
government.
and
if
the
president
were
attempting
to
negotiate
a
satisfactory
resolution
to
that
very
hypothetical
crisis,
we
wouldn't
want
him
to
be
hamstrung
by
a
statutory
barrier
to
his
doing
that.
so
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
say,
on
the
one
hand,
if
there
is
no
acceptance
by
the
receiving
country's
government,
the
secretary
will
never
be
required
to
remove
to
that
country
because
that
would
enmesh
the
executive
branch
in
an
international
confrontation
against
its
will.
it's
not
at
all
inconsistent
to
say,
nevertheless,
if
the
secretary
believes
that
repatriation
without
acceptance
can
be
done,
consistent
with
the
foreign
relations
objectives
of
the...
the
united
states
government,
it's
a
statutory
option.
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
we'd
have
two
responses.
the
first
is
we
would
not
agree
with
the
view
that
the
predecessor
language
would
forbid
removal
to
the
country
of
nationality
absent
acceptance
because
what
the
statute
said
was
that
if
the
government
of
the
relevant
foreign
country
doesn't
accept
or
doesn't
advise
the
attorney
general
of
what
its
stance
is,
then
about
five
or
six
lines
down
on
page
2a,
it
says,
then
such
deportation
shall
be
directed
by
the
attorney
general
within
his
discretion
and
without
necessarily
giving
any
priority
or
preference
because
of
their
order
as
herein
set
forth
either...
and
then
there's
the
same
series
of
countries,
and
one
of
those
is
the
country
in
which
the
alien
was
born.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
the
other
point
we
would
make
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
we
would...
we
would
disagree
with
that
statement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
we
would
disagree
that
that
was
the
appropriate
result
under
the
prior
statute.
the...
the
other
thing
we
would
say
about
this
point
is
that
if
we
are
otherwise
correct
about
subsection
(e)(iv),
that
is,
if
as
a
general
matter,
subsection
(e)(iv)
says
an
alien
may
be
removed
to
the
country
of
his
birth
whether
or
not
there
was
acceptance,
then
it
would
make
no
sense
to
say
but
you
can't
do
it
if
that
is
also
his
country
of
current
nationality
or
citizenship
because
removal
to
the
country
of...
the
current...
the
country
of
current
nationality
or
citizenship
is
a
preferred
country
of
removal.
that's
so
not
only
the...
under
the
statutory
scheme,
but
it's
also
the
country
that
under
international
law
has
an
obligation--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
petitioner's
reliance
on
subsection
(d)
is
to
the
effect
that
however
you
would
otherwise
read
subsection
(e),
subsection
(d)
deals
specifically
with
removal
to
the
country
of
nationality
or
citizenship,
and
if
you
don't
meet
the
prerequisites
for
removal
to
that
country
under
(d),
then
you
can't
do
an
end
run
by
resorting
to
(e).
and
i'm
saying
if
that
works
at
all,
it
could
work
only
when
(e)
is
invoked
to
authorize
removal
to
the
country
of
current
nationality
or
citizenship.
it...
(d)
couldn't
have
any
negative
implications
if
we
were
attempting
to
remove
somebody
to
somalia
because
he
was
born
there
even
though
he
was
currently
a
national
or
citizen
of
a
different
country.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
they...
they
don't
include
that,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
the
state
of
nationality
is...
is
always
or
virtually
always
going
to
be
covered
because
they
include
country
of
birth,
country
from
which
the
alien
departed
to
enter
the
united
states,
country
in
which
he
previously
resided,
country
of...
that's
under
the
sovereignty
of...
that
exercises
sovereignty
over
the
country
in
which
he
was
born.
one
reason
for...
possible
reason
for
parsing
it
the
way
congress
did
in
(e)
is
that
sometimes
the
reason
that
a
foreign
government
doesn't
give
acceptance
may
be
that
the
foreign
government
disputes
our
contention
that
this
individual
is
a
national
of
its
country,
and
in
order
to
avoid
a
recapitulation
of
that
dispute
at
the
subsection
(e)
stage,
congress
might,
at
least,
have
though
(e)
is
going
to
turn
on
objective
factors,
factors
that
are
unlikely
to
be
the
subject
of
dispute,
and
not
on
the
potentially
contested
question
of
what
country
is
the...
the
alien's
current
country
of
nationality.
the...
the
other
thing
i'd
like
to
say
about
the...
the
two
policy
justifications
that
petitioner
has
given.
the
one
is
that
this...
his
reading
of
the
statute
is
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the...
this
government
from
being
entangled
in
foreign
confrontations.
and...
and
our
view
is
that
the
executive
branch
is
well
equipped
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
that
is,
so
long
as
the
statute
doesn't
require
us
to
attempt
repatriation
over
the
objection
of
another
foreign
government,
the
executive
branch
is...
can
and
will
exercise
discretion
to
attempt
that
course
of
action
only
when
we
believe
that
it's
consonant
with
the
foreign
policy
goals
of
the...
the
united
states.
the
other
policy
objection
to
our
reading
that
petitioner
advances
is
that
places
without
functioning
central
governments
are
likely
to
be
dangerous
and
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
prohibit
removal
to
an...
a
country
where
the
alien
would
face
hardships.
and
we
don't
attempt
to
minimize
the
potential
for
hardship
if
an
alien
is
removed
to
somalia,
but
there
is
a
network
of
federal
statutory
provisions
that
specifically
address
the
question
of
resistance
to
removal
based
on
the
potential
for
harm
in
the
receiving
country.
and
if
petitioner
can't
qualify
under
any
of
those,
then
it's
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
intended
the
absence
of
a
functioning
central
government
to
serve
as
a
sort
of
prophylactic
or
surrogate
for
dangerous...
dangerousness.
and
it's
worth
noting
in
that
respect
that
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
currently
administers
the
temporary
protected
status
program
which
covers
somalia.
it
contains
broad
protections
for
removal
of
aliens
there,
but
petitioner
is
ineligible
for
relief
under
that
provision
because
of
his
criminal
conviction.
thank
you,
your
honor.
