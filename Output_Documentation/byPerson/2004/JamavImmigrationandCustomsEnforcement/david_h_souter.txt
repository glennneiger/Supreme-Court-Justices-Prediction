justice
david
h.
souter
one...
one
argument
in...
at
least
in
my
view,
that
would
certainly
help
you
in
your
reading
of
(e)
is
the
interpretation
that
you
put
on
(d).
and...
and
you
and
justice
scalia,
i...
i
think,
have
two
very
different
interpretations
of
what
(d)
requires.
you're
saying
that...
that
(d)
does,
in
fact,
require
a...
a...
the...
the
country...
if...
if
the
attorney
general
designates
the...
the
country
of
citizenship,
that
there
is
a
requirement
in
(d)
that
the...
that
the
country
accept.
whereas,
his
earlier
question
that...
that
spoke
of...
of...
and
the
issue
under
(e)
is
whether
an
alien
is
or
is
not
removed
as
opposed
to
can
or
cannot
be
removed.
his
earlier
question
indicates
the...
the
possible
reading
that
there
is
no
acceptance
requirement
in
(d).
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
it
is...
it
is
this,
that
(d)
requires
the
attorney
general
to
turn
to
the
country
of...
of
citizenship,
but
if
the
country
of
citizenship
does
not
accept
or
does
not
respond,
it
is
not
the...
the
consequence
is
not
that
the
attorney
general
cannot
deport
to
that
country,
but
simply
that
he
is
no
longer
required
to,
that
it
is
an
act
of
discretion.
what
is...
what
is
your
answer
to
that
argument,
that
there
is
no
absolute
acceptance
requirement,
merely
an
acceptance
requirement
to
maintain
the
attorney
general's
obligation
to
return
him
to
that
country?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
says
the
attorney
general
shall
remove
unless.
and
their
argument
is
if...
if
you
don't
get
the
condition
satisfied,
i.e.,
acceptance,
there's
no
longer
a
mandate,
i.e.,
shall.
it
simply
leaves
it
open,
a
matter
of
discretion.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stewart,
may
i
interrupt
you?
oh,
i'm...
may
i
interrupt
you
and
ask...
ask
this
question?
you're
right.
textually
there's...
there's
nothing
in
(iv)
that...
that
has
the
condition
of...
of
prior
approval.
the
argument...
one
argument
is
made
is
that
because
of
the
substantial
overlap
of...
of
the
subsections
in
(e)
with
the
country
of...
of
nationality
or
citizenship
in
(d),
that
if
you
do
not
recognize
a...
a
requirement
of
acceptance
for
the
(e)
categories,
basically
you're
going
to
do
an
end
run
around
(d).
the
government's
answer
to
that
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
as...
as
i
tried
to...
to
put
it
in
a
question
to
your...
your
friend,
is
that
there
is
no
absolute
requirement
of
acceptance
in
(d).
there
is
simply
a...
a...
the
attorney
general's
mandate
to
send
the
person
to
a...
a
country
of
citizenship
is...
is
subject
to
that.
but
if
the
country
will
not
accept,
the
attorney
general
still
has
discretion
to
send
him
to
that
country.
there
is
one
answer
to
that
that
your
brother
did
not
get
into,
and
i...
i
want
to
raise
it.
as
i
understand
it,
the
house
report
for
the...
what
was
it...
the
'96
act,
the
current
statute
anyway.
the
house
report
indicated
that
there
was
no
intent
to
change
the
substance
of
the
provisions
dealt
with
from
what
they
had
been
under
the
prior
statute.
and
under
the
prior
statute,
which
is
set
out
on...
on
page
1a
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
very
clear
that
there
was
an
absolute
requirement
of
acceptance
for
the
attorney
general
to
act
under
the
predecessor
language
to
what
is
now
subsection
(d).
if
you
look
down
to
within
the...
the
three
lines
from
the...
from
the
bottom
of...
of
page
1a,
which
refers
to
that,
there...
there
seems
to
be
a
clear
condition:
if
such
country
is
willing
to
accept
him
into
its
territory.
now,
if
i'm
reading
the
old
law
right
and
the
house
report
does
reflect
or
should
be
taken
by
us
in
interpretation
to
reflect
the
intent
of
congress,
then
don't
we
have
to
say
that
the
attorney
general's
authority,
not
merely
mandate,
but
authority,
under
(d)
requires
acceptance?
and
therefore,
if
we
take
your
view,
we
would,
in
effect,
allow
an
end
run
around
a
condition
indeed
because
the
attorney
general
could
simply
say,
okay,
i'm
going
to
go
to
little
(iv)
under
(e).
i'm
going
to
find
the
country
of
the
birth.
i
don't
have
to
get
acceptance.
it
happens
to
be
the
same
country
as
citizenship.
but...
but
in
he
goes,
or
at
least
up
to
the
border
he
goes.
what's
your
answer
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if...
if
there
is
acceptance,
he
does
have
to
remove.
if
there
is
no
acceptance,
he
has
discretion.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
you
could
say
that
he
shall
do
everything
he
possibly
can,
but
his
mandate
to
do
that
evaporates
if
there's
no
acceptance.
justice
david
h.
souter
it...
it
was
the
house
report.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
believe
that,
mr.
stewart--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
let's...
let's
erase
learned
hand--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may...
may
i
go
back
to,
let's
say,
the...
the
nub,
the
narrow
nub
of...
of
my
earlier
question,
and
that
is
this.
the
predecessor
language
to
what
is
now
subsection
(d),
as
i
read
it,
clearly
required
the
approval
of
the
country
if
there
was
to
be
a
removal
to
the
country,
a
repatriation
to
the
country.
the
house
report
says
we
don't
intend
to
make
any
change
in
the
substantive
law.
if
we
accept
the
house
report,
then
we've...
we're
going
to
say
that
the
proper
reading
of
(d)
is
not
your
reading,
but
the
reading
that
says
the
attorney
general
cannot
act
under
(d)
unless
there
is,
in
fact,
an...
an
acceptance
by
the
country.
and
if
that
is
true,
then
your
reading
of
roman
(iv)
in
(e)
allows
you
to
make
an
end
run
around
that
condition,
and
that
would
be
a
good
reason
for
interpreting
all
of
(e)
to
require
agreement
and
acceptance
by
the
country.
what
is
your
response
to
that
narrow
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
that
the
predecessor
language
can
be
read
the
same
way,
you
say,
(d)
can
be
read
now.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
