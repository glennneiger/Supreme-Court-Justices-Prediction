justice

bader

may
i
ask
you
preliminarily,
mr.
keyes?
the
government
takes
the
position
that
this
statute,
whatever
it
means,
was
intended
to...
with
the...
with
the
nation
abroad
in
view,
that
the
idea
was
not
to
insult
our...
our
neighbors
in
the
world
community,
so
to
recognize
that
they
have
the
prerogative
to
say
yes
or
no
to
somebody
being
sent
there,
being
removed
there,
but
that
the
statute
was
not
intended
to
confer
any
benefit
on
the
removable
alien.

the
united
states
has
turned
boats
back.
the
most
notorious
case
was
in
world
war...
before
world
war
ii--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before
we
entered
world
war
ii.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
government
said
you...
you
didn't
raise
this
question
below,
that
you
didn't
argue
that
somalia
wasn't
a
country.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
do
so,
could
you
tell
me
what
was
the
outcome
in
that
southern
district
of
texas
case
which
relied
on
this
decision,
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
here,
to
send
someone
to
ethiopia
without
consent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is...
is
there
anything
to
it
other
than
the
practical
objection
that
when
you
get
the
person
there,
the
country
won't
accept
him,
so
we
sent
him...
be
left
with
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--unless
we
dump
him
in
the
sea.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you...
you
think
judge
reavley,
who
was
sitting
on
the
ninth
circuit
at
the
time
and
dissented
in
the
ali
ali
case,
that
he
was
dead
wrong
when
he
said
the
prior
statute
did
condition
willing
acceptance
for
all
countries
to
which
aliens
could
be
deported.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
thinks...
his
dissent
turns
on
a
difference
between
the
current
statute
and
the
prior
statute.
