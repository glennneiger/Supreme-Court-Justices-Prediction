v.
the

mr.
keyes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
keyes,
we're
not
talking
about
removability
here,
are
we,
i
mean,
in
the
sense
that
a
dispute
over
whether
he
could
be
removed?
it's
just
a
question
of
where
he
can
be
removed
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
need
more
than
that,
don't
you?
are
you
saying
there's
no
interest...
indication
that
congress
was
concerned
with
other
than
the
subject
that
it
was
talking
about?
but...
but
you
need
something
affirmative
to
say
that
a
statute
confirms
a
right
on
a
private
individual.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
the...
can
the
alien
challenge
a
decision
by
the
attorney
general
that,
yes,
a
certain
country
has
accepted
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so
the
alien
can
litigate
that
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
question
you
actually
presented
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're...
you're
bound
by
the
question
that
you
presented,
and
it
is
whether
the
attorney
general
can
remove
an
alien
to
one
of
the
countries
designated
in
the
statute
without
obtaining
that
country's
acceptance
of
the
alien
prior
to
removal.
now
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
absence
of
a
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
say
specifically
or
generally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
addressed
by
the
majority
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
keyes.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
fly
him
to
the
border.
you
fly
him
to
an
airport
which
usually
isn't
on
the
border.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
keyes,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
keyes.
the
case
is
submitted.
