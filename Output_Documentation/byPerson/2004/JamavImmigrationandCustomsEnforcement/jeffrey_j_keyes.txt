mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
that
petitioner,
a
citizen
and
a
national
of
somalia,
can
be
deported
to
somalia
should
be
reversed.
the
applicable
removal
statute
requires
acceptance
from
the
country
of
which
the
alien
is
a
subject,
national,
or
citizen.
that
statute
is
8
u.s.c.
1231
(b)(2)(d)
as
in
david,
which
we
have
referred
to
as
step
two.
the
eighth
circuit
acknowledged
that
acceptance
is
required
for
such
a
removal.
the
parties
agree
that
somalia
has
no
functioning
government
that
can
give
acceptance
in
this
case,
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
circuit
court
ruled,
however,
that
petitioner
could
be
deported
to
somalia
because
the
statute
provides
that
if
the
alien
is
not
removed
to
his
country
of
citizenship,
then
he
can
be
removed
to
a
list
of
additional
countries
in
the
next
step
of
the
statute,
1231(b)(2)(e),
including
the
country
of
birth.
the
circuit
court
erred
in
that
ruling
for
the
following
reasons.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
your
honor,
the...
the
statute,
as
structured,
sets
forth...
congress
has
set
forth
order
with
respect
to
the
deportation
process,
has
set
forth,
for
example,
the
order
in
which
countries
should
be
chosen,
the
identity
of
those
countries
that
should
be
chosen.
the...
the
statute
is...
does
get
at
order
in
the
deportation
process,
and
if
an
alien
is
being
removed
to...
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
government
to
receive
the
alien,
where
the
alien
is
simply
being
expelled
from
the
united
states,
the
risk
arises
that
the
alien
will
bounce
back
to
the
united
states,
will
simply
be
in
international
traffic
with
no
country
to
receive
the
alien,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
which
would
indicate
that
the
interest
of
congress
in
ordering
the
removal
process
is
limited
simply...
limited
simply
to
a
concern
about
the
sovereignty
of
nations
of
the
other
country.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
the...
we
are
not
contending
that
the...
the
statute
invests
a
right
on
the
individual.
what
we
are
contending
is
that
the
statute
was...
as
expressed
in
the
statute
has
this
acceptance
requirement
that
would
apply
to
the
removal
process.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--yes,
yes.
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that
to...
to
give
it
that
reading,
one
has
to
limit
the
view
to
the
first
six
clauses.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
however,
the...
i
would
suggest
that
that
would...
that
would
take
subparagraph
(e)
out
of...
out
of
its
context,
and
there
are
several
very
important...
there's
important--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that
that...
that
is...
that's
not
the
case
for
the
following
reasons,
that
first
of
all,
the
way
(e)
begins,
it
says,
if
an
alien
is
not
removed
to
a
country
under
the
previous
subparagraphs.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
the
first
priority
is...
before
that
is
country
of
subject,
nationality,
or
citizenship
where
there
is
an
acceptance
requirement.
in
moving
to
(e)--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--your
honor,
the...
the...
what
(e)
does
is
that
it
doesn't
change
the
removal
process.
it
just
adds
for
the...
for
the
executive
branch,
it
adds
additional
countries,
other
countries,
that
they
can
remove
to.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--your
honor,
the...
the...
when
it
says,
if
an
alien
is
not
removed
to
a
country
under
the
previous
subparagraphs,
that...
that
is
moving
to
give
the
attorney
general
additional
countries
to
remove
to.
it
doesn't
change
the
process.
look,
for
example...
i
think
we
get
further
guidance
on
that
point
by
looking
at
clause
(vii)
which
is
obviously
a
part
of...
of
this
subparagraph
(e),
which
ends
with
the
words,
another
country
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien
into
that
country.
another
country
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien
into
that
country.
what
that...
what
that
does
is
that
it
gives
us...
it
references
back
to
the
first
six
clauses
and
reflects
the
fact
that
the
acceptance
requirement
is
always
present.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
it
is...
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--it...
it
does
depend
upon
the
emphasis
that
you
give,
but
i
would
suggest
that
if
we
are
going
to...
if
we
are
going
to
read
(e)
to
mean
that
what
the
congress
intended
was
that
you're
going
to
have
an
acceptance
requirement
for
removal
under
(d),
step
two,
the
subject,
nation,
or
citizenship
country,
but
then
we're
going
to
move
to
(e)
and
we're
going
to
give
you
a
list
of
other
countries
that
are
presumably
less...
or
have
a
less
closer
connection
to
the
alien
than
in
(d).
and
with
respect
to
those
countries,
those
ones
that
are
just
in
clauses
(i)
through
(vi),
we're
not
going
to
have
any
acceptance
requirement.
but
then
we're
going
to
put
it
back
in
in
clause
(vii)
if...
when
you
have
to
go
then
to
some
other
country
to
get
acceptance.
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
not
a...
a
sensible
reading
of
the--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--i...
i...
we
didn't--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--it...
it...
we
didn't
find
anything
that
explained
why.
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that
it
reinforces
my
point
and
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--that's...
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
that
is
correct.
the...
the...
we...
we
did
in
the...
there
is
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
those...
that
gives
the
legislative
history,
there
is
a
reference
to
the
major
report
of
the
judiciary
committee
in
connection
with
the
'96
legislation,
which
says
that
this
whole
section
of
the...
of
the
ina
is
being...
is
restating
the...
the
previous
law.
so...
so
that's
what...
that's
what
we
have.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
two
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
it's
the
language
of
(d).
it
says,
remove
to
subject,
national,
or
citizenship
country
unless
the
government
of
the
country
does
not
affirmatively
inform
about
acceptance
or...
or--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--and...
and
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that
the...
the
consequence
of
the
unless
language
should
be
that
unless
this
happens,
don't
do
it.
but...
but...
so
that
would
be
my...
my
suggested
reading
of
the
language.
but
the
second
reason,
going
to
the
structure
of
the
statute,
which
i
think
reinforces
that
and...
and
is
important,
is
that
if
it
had
been...
if
it
had
been
congress'
intent
that
if
the
government
couldn't
remove
to
the
country
of
citizenship
because
it
couldn't
get
acceptance,
that
it
could
then
move
to
step
(e)
and
remove
anyway
to
overcome
that
acceptance,
congress
would
not
have
gone
about
writing
the
statute
the
way
that
it
did.
the
way
that
it
wrote
the
statute
is
that
it
provided
in
(e)
for
other
countries
that
the...
that
the
attorney...
attorney
general
could
remove
to,
and
every
one
of
those
countries
can
be
a
different
country
than
the
country
of
citizenship
by
their
definition.
it
would...
it
would
have
been
a
very
strange
way
for
the...
the
congress
to
have
given
the
attorney
general
the
discretion
to
remove
anyway,
to
make
it
contingent
upon
one
of
those
countries
in
clauses
(i)
through
(vi)
to
happen
to
be
the
same
country
as
the
country
of
subject,
nationality,
or
citizenship.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
the...
the...
i
think
that
the...
the
best
way
to
approach
the
statute...
and
i
think
it...
it
can...
it
can
shed
light
on...
on
your
question...
is
that
if
we
start
with
the
premise
that
what
removal
is
is
the
transfer
of
the
alien
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
the
government
of
the
country
of
removal.
and
that
is
what
removal
is.
so
if
we
start
with
that
premise,
then
it
makes
absolute
sense
here
that
there
wouldn't
be
at
each
place
where
the...
the
statute
identifies
a...
a
country,
where
the
statute
would
have
to
say...
make
a
specific
reference
to
the
acceptance
requirement.
my
point
about
reading
the
statute
that
way,
in
terms
of
its
general
condition,
is
that
it
explains
how
throughout
the
statute
you
would
have
the...
the
reference
to
acceptance
in
the
context
in
which
it
appears,
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
repeat
it
every
place
where
you...
where
you
referenced
a
country
of
removal.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
it
would...
in...
in
this
removal
process,
it
does
require
acceptance
from
the
country
of
removal.
now...
now,
they--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--the...
the
reason
why
it...
it
would
fit
in
with
the...
with
the
statute
is
that
congress
has
in
this
statute
has
expressed
an
interest
in
the
orderly
process
of
deportation.
if...
if
it...
let's
take
two
examples,
your
honor.
if
the...
if
the
country
of
removal
refuses,
does
not
want
to
have...
will...
will
not
take
the
alien
back...
there
is
a
government
and
they
refuse...
then
the...
the
reason
why
it
makes
sense
to
have
this
acceptance
requirement
is
that
in
all
deportations,
it
will
make
it
less
likely
that
the
deportee
is
going
to
be
bounced
around
in
international
traffic
and
come
back
to
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
the...
i...
i...
if
there
is
a...
if
there
was
a
wholly
unreasonable
claim
by
the
government
that
there
was
acceptance,
they...
not--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--i
think
that
the
alien
can
if
the...
if
the
government
were
to
take
a
position...
let's
say
in...
in...
in
a...
in...
in
this
case
the
government
agrees,
admits
that
there
is
no
acceptance.
but
let's
say
that
the
government
took
the
position
to
say
that
we
can...
we
can
call
anything
acceptance
and
we
can...
we
can
ship
you
out
of
the
united
states
with
a
wholly
unreasonable
definition
of
acceptance.
then
the
alien
should
in
that
circumstance
be
able
to
have
access
to
the
courts
to
be
able
to
challenge
that...
that
decision.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
well,
you...
you
should
know
that
because
that
is
the...
the
acceptance
is
the
willing
receipt
of
the...
of
the
alien
by
the
country
of
removal.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
the...
the
instances
we
know
about
come
from
the...
from
the
tom
man
case,
which
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
in
1958.
and
in
that
case,
what
the
government
wanted
to
do
was
to
take
the
alien
to
the
border
of
the...
of
communist
china
and
to
see
whether
or
not
they
could
get
him
across
the
border.
and
in
the...
and...
and
in
construing
this...
this
very
provision
in
the
language
that
it
was
in
in
1952,
judge
learned
hand
for
the...
for
the
court
said
that...
that
acceptance
was
required
under
step
three
for
each
of
the
subparts
and
that
that
would
violate
the
statute.
we
know
of
other
instances,
your
honor,
to
answer
the
question,
in
terms
of
procedures
where
in...
in
the
1950's,
'60's,
that
the...
what
the
government
would
do
would
be
to
take
the...
remove
the
alien
to
hong
kong
and
then
there
were
situations
where
the
hong
kong
authorities
may
or
may
not
send
that
alien
on
to...
on
to
china.
but
there
was...
there
has
always
been...
every
opinion
from
the...
from
the
time
this
statute
went
into
effect
in
1952,
up
until
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
jama,
has
said
that
what
this
statute
means
at
each
of
its
steps
is
that
acceptance
is
required.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
we
don't...
we
don't
know
of
any,
and
the...
and
the
government
has...
has
not
cited--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--we
say
there
can't
be.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
the
reason
for
that
is
that
this
statute
deals
with
the
removal
of
aliens
who
have
been
through
removal
proceedings.
in
that
situation,
presumably
what
would
happen
is
that
those...
those
aliens
would
be
excluded.
they
would
be
subject
to...
probably
to
expedited
removal
under
a
different
statute.
we're
dealing
here
with
aliens
who
have
been
admitted
into
the
united
states.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
it...
it...
yes,
it
does.
the...
the
statute
does.
it
starts
in...
in
(2),
1231(b)(2)(b),
other
aliens,
and
(1)
is
arriving
aliens
who
are
in
removal
proceedings.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
it...
it
has.
and...
and
given
the
fact
that
this
statute
was
originally
passed
in
1952,
in
1952
there
was
a...
we
know
from
the
legislative
history,
there
was
enormous
concern
about
the
fact
that
the...
the
communist
countries
would
not
receive
back
their
citizens.
so
the
concern
was
that
we
had
communist
agents
or
aliens
in
the
united
states
and
we
couldn't
deport
them.
what
congress
did
in
this
statute
was
that...
in
1952
is
that
it...
it
didn't
change
the
acceptance
requirement,
but
what
it
did
do
was
it
expanded
the
list
of
countries
to
which
the
government
could
deport.
those
are
the
countries
we
now
have--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
there
is.
yes,
it...
it
does
mean...
that
is
a
separate
reason
why
the...
under...
under
(e)
the
petitioner
cannot
be
removed
to
somalia
because
there
is...
it's
not
a
country
as
that
should
be
properly
defined
in
the
statute.
and...
and
let
me
give
you,
i
think,
a
good
history
on
that.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
itself
in...
in
1985
in
the
linnas
case,
specifically
addressing
in
(e)
the
term
country,
said
that
to
be
a
country
under
this
statute,
there
had
to
be
two
things:
a
territory
and
there
had
to
be
a
functioning
government
that
exercised
sovereignty
over
its
people.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
well,
i--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--i...
i
don't...
i
don't
know
if...
if
that
is
so.
i
can
point
to
and
we
have
pointed
to
in...
in
the
briefs
to
a
whole
series
of
cases.
i...
i
mentioned
the
bia
decision,
but
there's
a
whole
series
of
cases
in
the...
in
the
1950's,
1960's
which
said
that
country
had
to
have
a
functioning
government.
i'll...
i'll
give
you
one...
one
good
example
and
that
is
the
ying
case
where...
where
the
court,
circuit
court,
said
that
it
was
dealing
with
whether
hong
kong
could
be
a...
a
country.
and
it
said
hong
kong
can
be
because
it
has
the
following
characteristics.
it
has
a
legislative
body.
it
has...
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
political
organization.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
your
honor,
it...
it...
this
is...
this
is
not
a
new
claim
or
a
new
issue.
it
is
an
argument
on
the
issue
that
is
presented,
which
is
whether
petitioner
can
be
removed
to
the
country
of
birth
under
(e)
when
there
is
no
functioning
government
that
can
either
object
or
accept
him.
and
since
there
is
no
country,
he
can't
be.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
well,
your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
quote
the...
the
government's
phrasing
of
the
question
in...
in--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--your
honor,
it...
it
doesn't
specifically
say--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--it...
it...
what
i
would
say
is
that
the...
that
if
you
go...
if
there
is
no
government
in
that
country,
then
there
can
be
no
acceptance.
so
we
must
refer
back
to
that.
i
would
also
cite
the
fact,
your
honor,
that
this
issue
was
specifically
addressed
by
the...
by
both
parties
in
the
district
court.
it...
and
the...
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the...
the
dissent
specifically
raised
this
as...
as
a
matter
in
terms
of--
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
--it
was
not
addressed
by
the
majority
opinion,
no,
your
honor.
i
would...
i
would...
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
j.
keyes
i
would
like
to
respond
by
pointing
out
that
on
the...
on
the
point
that
justice
souter
raised
with
respect
to
the
language
of
the
statute
prior
to
1996,
my...
my
brother
counsel
did
not
quote
the
most
important
part
of
the
statute
that
was
in
effect
at
that
time.
it's
set
forth
on...
on
6a
of
the
brief
for
petitioner.
and
the
critical
part
says,
thereupon
deportation
of
such
alien
shall
be
directed
to
any
country
of
which
such
alien
is
a
subject,
national,
or
citizen
if
such
country
is
willing
to
accept
him
into
its
territory.
that
same
language
did
not
just
appear
in
the
statute
just
prior
to
1996.
that
was
the
language
that
was
in
the
statute
in
1952
when
it
was
first
passed,
and
that
can
be
found
on
page
1a
to
1b
of...
of
our
brief.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
we
can...
in
terms
of...
of
interpreting
this
statute,
it's
also
helpful
to
look
at
other
statutes
that
were
passed
in
1996,
specifically
in
the
alien
terrorist
statute
where
the
government
is...
gets
to
remove
someone
who's
been
classified
as
an
alien...
alien
terrorist.
that
statute,
which
is
8
u.s.c.
1537(b),
starting
on
page
8a
of
our
brief,
says
specifically
that
an
alien
terrorist
shall
be
removed
to
a
country
whose
government
is
willing
to
accept
that
alien.
i
would
submit
that
this,
if
in
fact,
congress
is
going
to
have...
if
we're
going
to
have
this
removal
requirement
applies
clearly
to
alien
terrorists,
then
certainly
this
demonstrates
that
this
has...
this
requirement
has
always
been
part
of
that
statute.
and
in
1996
congress
had
before
it
those
consistent
interpretations.
congress
also
had
before
it
in
1996
the
fact
that
tens
of
thousands
of
aliens
could
not
be
deported
over
the
years
to
countries
that
would
not
accept
them.
and
in
1996,
it
restated
the
statute,
having
those
facts
and
also
the
consistent
judicial
history
which
interpreted
the
statute
to
always
require
acceptance.
as
a
result
of
that,
we
could
apply
the
principle
that
there
was
no
watchdog
barking
in
the
night.
thank
you.
