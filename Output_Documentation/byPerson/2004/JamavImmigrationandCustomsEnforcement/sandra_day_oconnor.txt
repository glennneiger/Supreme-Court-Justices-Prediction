well,
but
it
is
possible
to
read
the
statute,
particularly
part
(e),
the
first
series
of
subsections
of
it,
as
the
eighth
circuit
did.
that
is
a
possible
reading
of
the
statute
and
to
find
there
is
not,
indeed,
an
acceptance
requirement
under
many
of
those
little
subsections.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
i
should
say
clauses
perhaps.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
when
i
read
the
statute
as
a
whole
and
went
through
all
the
possibilities
there
and
got
to
(e),
it
read
as
though,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
congress
did
want
to
provide
some
place
of
removal
for
people
in
the
absence
of
acceptance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
obviously
congress
prefers
to
have
a
country
act
with
acceptance.
that...
that's
understandable,
but
what
(e)
appeared,
to
me
at
least,
to
be
was
if
all
those
things
had
been
exhausted,
we're
going
to
still
allow
removal
under
little
subclause
(i),
(ii),
(iii),
(iv),
and
(vi).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it...
it's
very
odd
when
the
petitioner's
question
was
broader
and
turned
on
whether
there
was
acceptance
or
not.
