justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
doesn't
begin
that
way.
it
doesn't
begin
if
an
alien
cannot
be
removed
to
a
country
under
the
previous
subparagraphs.
it
says,
if
an
alien
is
not
removed
to
a
country
under
the
previous
subparagraphs.
and
whether
he
is
or
not
is
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general.
none
of
those
sentences
or
paragraphs
requires
removal
to
those
countries.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
it
says
if
he
is
not,
then
the...
the
attorney
general
has
these
additional
options.
i
mean,
you...
you'd
have
a
stronger
argument
if
it...
if
it
read
cannot
be
removed,
but
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
well,
i
mean,
that
clause
could...
could
be
read
either
way.
another
country
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien
is
one
way
to
read
it,
and
another
way
to
read
it
is
another
country
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's...
that's
the...
that's
the
ambiguity
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
think
is
very
strange
is
the...
is...
is
for
you
to
read
back
up
to
all
the
other
clauses,
(i)
through
(vi),
the
phrase,
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien.
i
mean,
if...
if
acceptance
is
a
condition
for
all
of
those
preceding
things,
my
goodness,
that's
certainly
not
the
way
to
make
it
clear,
to
tag
it
onto
(vi)
instead
of
putting
it
in
the
introduction
or
in
a
clause
that
comes
after
(i)
through
(vii)
and
goes
out
to
the
margin
after
that.
you...
you
want
us
to
read
back
to
(i)
through
(vi)
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so,
as
you
read...
as
you
read
this
statute,
the
united
states
can
never
send
somebody
back
to
a
country
that
doesn't
want
them.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
would...
why
would
congress
ever
want
to
impose
that
categorical
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
there
can't
be
any
under
this
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
if
some
state
opens
its
prisons
and
puts
its
criminals
on
a
boat
and
sends
them
to
the
united
states,
as
has
happened
in
the
past,
your
interpretation
of
this
statute
is
that
congress
has
forbidden
the
president
from
shipping
these
criminals
back
where
they
came
from,
so
long
as
the
country
that
expelled
them
doesn't
want
these
criminals
back.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what...
what
are
you
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
did
you
narrow
the
question
presented
in
your
brief
if
you're
willing
to
take
that...
that
much
more
categorical
position
and
much
more
important
position
for
the
government?
when...
the...
the
question
presented,
as
you
describe
it
in
your
brief,
is
whether
immigration
officials
may
remove
petitioner
to
his
country
of
birth
when
that
country
lacks
a
functioning
central
government
that
is
able
either
to
accept
or
object
to
petitioner's...
that's
a
much
narrower
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--than...
than
the
one
presented
by
petitioner.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
you
want
us
to
decide?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
don't
think
it's
the
logical
thrust
necessarily,
and
if
we...
if
we
did
it
the
way
your
question
presented
suggests,
we're
deciding
this
case
only
for
people
who
are
going
to
be
deported
to
somalia
or...
what
other
areas
of
the
world
have
no
functioning
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
i
wouldn't
have
voted
to
take
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
were
born
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--raised
by
penguins,
send
them--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
they
are...
whether
they
are
a
government
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
people
with
guns.
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
we're...
we're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we're
going
too
far.
it
doesn't
just
say
if
they
refuse
to
accept.
if
they
don't
respond
within
30
days.
so
it
may
well
be
that
you...
that
you
can
proceed
to
(e)
with
respect
to
a...
a
country
that
simply
has
not
responded.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
an
inefficient
ministry
of
state,
and...
and
the
guy
arrives.
they
say,
oh,
we're...
we're
delighted
to
have
this
fellow
back.
our
response
got
lost
in
the
mail
or
something.
there's
no...
no
reason
you
can't
proceed
to
(e)
just
because
of
the
existence
of
(d).
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
house
wrote
that
in
the
report.
right?
was
that
in
the
senate
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
president
know
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
--good
point.
good
point.
[laughter]
justice
antonin

you...
you
mean
if
he
had
been
on
this
court,
he
would
have
been
infallible.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
haven't
followed
you.
would
you
say...
make
that
argument
again?
justice
antonin

that's...
that's
not
one
of
the
choices
under
(e).
it
doesn't...
(i)
through

justice

these
are
both
cases
involving
immigration.
the
first
one
is
no.
03-674,
jama
versus
immigration
and
customs
enforcement.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
a
citizen
of
somalia
who
was
admitted
to
the
united
states
as
a
refugee.
after
he
was
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
instituted
proceedings
to
remove
him
from
the
united
states.
petitioner
conceded
that
he
was
removable
and
the
immigration
judge
designated
somalia
as
the
country
to
which
he
would
be
removed.
petitioner
sought
habeas
corpus
relief
in
federal
district
court.
he
contended
that
the
immigration
laws
preclude
his
removal
to
somalia
without
the
advance
consent
of
that
nation’s
government
and
that
because
somalia
has
no
functioning
government,
the
united
states
could
not
obtain
the
requisite
consent.
the
district
court
agreed
but
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
that
decision
holding
that
no
advance
consent
is
required.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit.
when
an
alien
in
petitioner’s
situation
is
ordered
removed,
section
1326(b)(2)
of
title
8
sets
out
a
4-step
procedure
for
selecting
the
destination
country.
first,
the
alien
shall
be
removed
to
the
country
of
his
choice.
the
statute
says
that
the
attorney
general
may,
not
that
he
must,
but
that
he
may
disregar
that
choice
for
various
reasons
including
the
unwillingness
of
the
chosen
country
to
accept
the
alien.
if
the
alien
is
not
removed
on
the
first
step,
step
two
provides
he
shall
be
removed
to
the
country
of
which
he
is
a
citizen
unless
that
country
fails
to
manifest
its
acceptance
within
a
reasonable
time.
if
step
two,
the
citizenship
test
does
not
produce
removal,
step
three,
provides
that
the
alien
shall
be
removed
to
one
of
a
list
of
countries
with
which
he
has
a
lesser
but
still
significant
connection
including
the
country
of
his
birth;
and
finally,
if
removal
to
every
country
on
the
list
in
step
three
is
“impractical,
inadvisable,
or
impossible”
the
alien
shall
be
removed
to
“another
country
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien
into
that
country.”
the
question
here
is
whether
the
attorney
general
was
precluded
from
removing
petitioner
under
the
third
step
to
somalia,
his
country
of
birth
because
somalia
had
not
agreed
to
accept
him.
we
conclude
not.
subparagraph
e
of
section
1326(b)(2)
sets
out
the
third
step
of
the
process
in
clauses
(i)
through
(vi),
and
the
fourth
step
in
clause
(vii).
in
all
of
subparagraph
e,
an
acceptance
requirement
appears
only
in
the
terminal
clause
(vii),
a
clause
that
the
attorney
general
may
invoke
only
after
he
finds
that
all
of
the
removal
options
presented
in
the
other
six
are
"impractical,
inadvisable,
or
impossible".
clauses
(i)
through
(vi)
come
first
in
the
statute
and
in
the
process
of
selecting
a
country.
those
six
clauses
contain
not
a
word
about
acceptance
by
the
destination
country.
that
absence
is
conspicuous
because
at
each
other
step
of
the
process,
the
statute
prescribes
the
effect
to
be
given
non-acceptance.
what
petitioner
wants
us
to
do
is
to
infer
from
the
phrase
in
clause
(vii),
another
country
whose
government
will
not
accept
the
alien
into
that
country.
to
infer
from
that,
that
clause
(i)
through
(vi)
also
refer
only
to
countries
whose
governments
will
accept.
we
conclude
however,
that
the
structure
of
the
paragraph
which
places
that
phrase
in
a
separately
numbered
clause
and
the
grammatical
rule
of
the
last
antecedent
which
we
have
used
in
other
cases
limit
the
effect
of
that
language
to
the
terminal
clause
in
which
it
appears.
moreover,
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
to
conclude
that
removal
under
clauses
(i)
through
(vi)
could
be
“inadvisable,
impractical,
or
impossible”
thus
making
clause
(vii)
applicable
when
in
fact
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind.
the
record
before
us
demonstrates
that
removing
petitioner
to
somalia
involves
nothing
more
than
putting
him
on
one
of
the
regularly
scheduled
flights
from
dubai
or
nairobi.
we
also
believe
that
there
is
no
warrant
in
the
structure
of
1231(b)(2)
for
reading
an
acceptance
requirement
into
the
third
step
for
reasons
that
i
need
not
be
labored.
the
removal
statute
finally
was
enacted
in
its
present
form
in
1996
and
petitioner
points
to
a
second
circuit
case
that
read
an
acceptance
requirement
into
its
statutory
predecessor
which
dates
back
to
1952.
in
reenacting
a
statute
unchanged,
congress
sometimes
ratifies
a
well
established
judicial
interpretation,
but
a
single
decision
by
a
single
court
of
appeals
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
finding
such
ratification,
and
even
if
it
were,
the
present
day
removal
statute
traces
its
antecedents
to
two
prior
provisions,
not
just
the
one
involved
in
the
second
circuit
opinion.
for
these
reasons
and
others
expressed
in
our
opinion
today,
we
hold
that
section
1231(b)(2)
permits
removal
of
an
alien
to
a
country
selected
at
step
three
whether
or
not
that
country
has
agreed
to
accept
it.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens,
ginsburg,
and
breyer
have
joined.
