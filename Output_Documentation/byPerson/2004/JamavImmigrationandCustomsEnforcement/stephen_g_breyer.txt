justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know
why?
did
you
come
across
anything
that
explained
why
there
was
a
change
in
language
in
that
clause
(vii)
between
the
1952
version
and
the
present
one?
the
'52
one
said,
to
any
country
which
is
willing
to
accept
such
alien
into
its
territory,
and
then
(vii)
said,
another
country
whose
government
will
accept
the
alien.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
know...
is
there
anything?
is
that
an
accident,
a
drafting...
just
simply
drafting
style
or
something
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
it
does.
it
helps
you
quite
a
lot
that
it
says
government,
but
it
doesn't...
at
the
same
time
it
doesn't...
it...
it
doesn't
help
you
in
respect
to
whether
(vii)
applies
to
the
first
six.
it
does
help
you
in
respect
to
if
you
win
that
point,
that's
it
because
there's
no
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
otherwise,
you
could
argue--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
happened
in
china?
i
mean,
what...
this
all
comes
from
the
'52
act,
and
it
was
a
big
issue
then
that
we
didn't
recognize
communist
china
and
they
would
take
people
to
the
border.
how...
how
did
that
work?
were
there...
were
there
instances
under
the
'52
act
where
they
just
would
take
somebody
to
macau
or
something
and
push
him
across
the
border,
or
what...
what
happened?
how
did
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
are
there
instances
where
we
have
deported
people
to
places
that
they
said,
no,
we
won't
take
him,
and
we
have
anyway?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
another--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what's
bothering
me
partly
in
this
case
is
it's
being
argued
on
the
ground
that
this
is
like
a
country
that
says
we
don't
want
him.
in
fact,
this
is
a
country
that
hasn't
said
we
don't
want
him.
it's
a
country
that
hasn't
said
anything.
it's
not
a
country
perhaps.
and...
and
that's
what...
really
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
place
without
a
government
is
a
place
where
you
can
send
him
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
maybe
this
is
all
evidentiary
when
they
changed
the
word...
add
the
word
government,
that
the
word
country
throughout
is
simply
assuming
a
place
that
has
an
organized
government.
is
there...
is
that
so?
is
there
anything
you
want
to
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
the
word
country
probably
appears
in
the
immigration
statute
in
the
context
of
deportation
since
the
first
statute
that
provided
it.
so
have
you
done
any
work
on
that?
i...
i
hate
to
sort
of
have
to
look
that
up
for
the
first
time,
but
the...
the...
is
there
any
work
that
you
can
report
in
respect
to
that
word
country?
there
never
under
that...
the
easiest
thing
for
you
would
be
if...
if
this
word
country...
there
never
has
been
under
a
statute
that
used
the
word
country
a
deportation
to
a
place
that
had
no
organized
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
could
affirm
that
that's
so,
then
that
would
be
very
strong
for
you.
but
maybe
that
isn't
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
much
narrower.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i...
as
i
understand
it,
following
up
a
bit
on
justice
scalia,
the
question
presented
is
whether
he
can
remove
an
alien
to
one
of
the
countries
designated
without
obtaining
that
country's
acceptance.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
one
possible...
prior...
of
the
alien
prior
to
removal.
that's...
i'm
just
reading
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--from
their
cert
petition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
the
cert
petition
says,
without
obtaining
that
country's
acceptance
of
the
alien.
now,
i
grant
you
it's
sort
of
a
hidden
argument
there,
but
it's
mentioned
or
whatever.
is...
one
reason
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no
is
because
where
that
country
does
not
have
a
functioning
government,
it
is
not
a
country
within
the
meaning
of
country
as
used
in
this
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's...
that's
an
answer
no
to
the
question
presented
for
a
very
narrow
reason
that
does
not
get
us
involved
in
anything
other
than
somalia.
is
there...
i
mean,
maybe
we
shouldn't
reach
it
because
it
wasn't
argued
all
that
much,
but
it
seemed
to
me
just
another
argument
being
advanced
in
favor
of
their
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
not
saying
you
can
dump
people
in
antarctica
or
possibly
send
them
to
the
moon.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
antarctica
is
a
country?
so
we
could
take
all
these
people,
send
them
to
antarctica.
they'll
live
with
the
penguins?
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
that...
they
can
win
on
that
one
because
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
prior
in
(vii).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
put
the
two
questions--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
now,
putting
those
three
questions
together,
it
seemed
to
me
what
you're
saying
it
is
possible
to
read
the
statute
the
way
you're
saying.
it
is
also
possible
to
read
the
statute
the
opposite.
and
the
brief
that
i
found
very
helpful
on
this
was
this
ali
ali
brief
where
everything
is
set
out
really
quite
parallel.
you
get
every
version
of
the
statute
right
in
front
of
you.
and
as
i
read
that,
it...
you
look
at
the
'52
version...
and
i
think
it's
clearer
on
this
point,
and
it's
against
you
insofar
as
it's
clearer.
but
then,
in
addition,
you
have
four
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
including
a
decision
by
learned
hand,
all
of
whom
say
that
justice
souter's
suggestion
there
is
what
the
statute
means,
and
there's
nothing
to
the
contrary.
and
then
after
that,
congress
reenacts
those
same
statutes
with
all
the
little
bits
and
i
think
some
unclarifying
changes
in
language,
but
they
write
in
the
report,
we
don't
mean
any
substantive
change
by
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
people
actually
read
those
reports
and
feel
they
are
a
clue
to
what
congress
is
trying
to
get
at.
and
here,
if
that
is
a
clue,
the
clue
says
that
there
is
to
be
no
substantive
change
from
a
provision
that
was
unanimously
interpreted
by
four
circuits,
including
learned
hand,
to
be
with
the
other
side
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i'm
interested--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is
an
amazing
non
sequitur.
