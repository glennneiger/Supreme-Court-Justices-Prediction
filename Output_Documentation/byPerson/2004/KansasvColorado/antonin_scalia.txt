justice
antonin
scalia
this
will
begin
in
2007,
as
i
recall.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
what
i
don't
understand
is
even...
even
if
we
agree
with
you
that
it
should
be
done
annually,
why...
why
wouldn't
you
propose
that
it
be
done
annually
using
the
previous
7
years'
experience
that
we
now
have
and
then,
you
know,
ultimately
by
2007,
we
can
use
the
previous
10
years?
i...
i
don't
understand
why
we
have
to
do
it
year
by
year
and
forego
even
7
years'
benefit
of...
of
this
methodology.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
that...
that's...
i
said
just
the
opposite.
i
said
i...
i
don't
know
why
we
should
begin
looking
for
this...
at
this
year
only
using
this
methodology.
why
shouldn't
we
average
this
methodology
over
the
previous
7
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
do
you
dispute
what...
what
the
master
found
here,
that
the
methodology
is
more
accurate
on
a
10-year
average
than
it
is
year
by
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
actual
year-by-year
results.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i...
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand
that...
that
the
master
concluded
that
even
as
to
a
particular
year,
the
model
will
be
more
accurate
if
you
use
the
average
from
the
previous
10
years
than
if
you
just
applied
the
model
to
a
single
year,
that
even
as
to
the
real
results
for
that
single
year,
the
model
will
be
more
accurate
if
you
use
a
10-year
average.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
thought
that
the
compact
specifically
provided
there
shall
be
no
allowance
or
accumulation
of
credits
or
debits
for
or
against
either
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
does
that
comport
with
what
you
just
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
it's
not
a
credit
for
accounting
purposes,
then
they're
going
to
owe
you
just
as
much
the
next
year
even
though...
even
though
you
had
more
water
the
previous
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
do
it
on
a
monthly
basis?
indeed,
why
don't
you
do
it
on
a
daily
basis?
i
mean,
the
master
found
that
this
model
really
works
if
you...
if
you
stretch
it
out
over
10
years.
you
say
1
year.
why
don't
you
do
it
month
by
month?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
the
system
you
propose,
the
river
master's
decision
would
be
appealable
to
us,
and
we
would
review
it
de
novo.
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
very
loathe
to
deprive
either
of
the
states
of
their...
their
right
to
have
this
court
decide
matters
between
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
would
if
they
can
only
come
here
and...
and
overturn
the
river
master
if
he's
clearly
erroneous.
that's
a...
that's
a
very
high
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
had
thought
that
your
proposal
was
de
novo
review.
this
is...
this
is
new
to
me,
that...
that
you
want
it
clearly
erroneous.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
deal.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
deal
they
came
to.
why
should
we
kick
it
over?
they
came
to
that
arrangement,
and
it
was
approved
by
congress,
and
now
you
come
back
and
tell
us,
oh,
this
is
too
cumbersome.
you
should...
you
should
appoint
this
river
master
to
do
an
end
run
around
it.
i...
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
disputes
are
going
to
come
up
here
eventually
anyway
if
the
states
are
intransigent.
ultimately
it
will
be
a
dispute
about
the
application
of
the
compact
and
it
will
come
back
here
anyway,
won't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
binding
arbitration
will...
will
mercifully
keep
this
stuff
off
of
our
desk,
won't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
we
made
a
mistake
with
respect
to
the
pecos
river
and
what
was
the
other
one?
delaware?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
the
government
takes
no
position
on
this
1-year
versus
10-year
computation?
justice
antonin
scalia
too
hard
for
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
lot
of
money
involved,
and...
and
you
certainly
didn't
argue
it
here.
i
don't
recall
that
point
being
argued.
and
with
all
that
money
being
involved,
i
would
have
thought
it
would
have
been
argued.
