we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
105
original,
kansas
v.
colorado.
mr.
draper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
master
found
that
the
role
of
the
river
master
in
the
pecos
case
was
quite
different
than
the
role
of
the
river
master
you
want
to
have
appointed
here.
he
found
that
the
role
of
the
river
master
in
the
pecos
cases
was
really
ministerial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
agree
with
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
please
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
pecos
master
can
simply
apply
this
formula,
can
he
not,
and
get
the
results
that
the
compact
requires?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
curious
is
that
i
believe
the
pecos
master
is
an
engineer.
he's
not
a
lawyer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he's
also
the
cheapest
master
we've
ever
had.
[laughter]
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
master
you
want
appointed
has
got
to
be
a
lawyer
and
make
legal
decisions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
draper.
mr.
robbins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
draper,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking
about
the
brief
in
the
earlier
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
draper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
