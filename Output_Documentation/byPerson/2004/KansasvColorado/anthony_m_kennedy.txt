justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
part
or
all
of
the
objectives
of
both
the...
the
decree
and
the
10-year
model
to
conserve
subsurface
reservoirs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then...
well,
then
why
isn't...
if...
if
that's
so,
why
isn't
it
that
colorado
shouldn't
get
credit
for
the
wet
years
in...
in...
on
an
average?
you're
concerned
about
the
dry
years.
it
seems
to
me
that
colorado
should
be
given
some
credit
for
the
wet
years
when
the
subterranean
reservoirs
are...
are
replenished.
or
am
i
wrong...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
why
are
you
using
a
10-year
model
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
what
you're...
what
you're
saying
is
forget
the
10
years.
just
do
it
every
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
relation
do
you
or...
yes...
working
relation
do
you
anticipate,
if...
if
the
river
master
is
appointed,
between
the
river
master
and
the
commission?
does
he
go
first
to
the
commission
and
try
to
get
agreement
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
the
commission
decided
to
appoint
an
arbitrator.
would
the
special...
pardon
me.
would
the
river
master
then
proceed
independently
and
we'd
have
two
different
recommendations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
would
seem
to
me,
procedurally
at
least,
the
river
master
would
have
if
not
the
legal,
at
least
the
practical
obligation
to
refer
things
first
to
the
commission.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
that,
as
i
read
his
report,
he
was
simply
interpreting
our
opinion,
best
he
could,
on
the
second
go-round.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
i
think
that's
what's
before
us
here.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
your
best
argument
for
no
interest
post
'85
on
the
pre-'85
damages
is
to
say,
well,
it's
uncertain,
it's
hard
to
compute,
but
that
doesn't
quite
work
because
this
court...
and
of
course,
the
special
master...
allowed
damages...
the
interest
on
post-'85
damages
even
though
those
are
equally
difficult
to
compute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i'm...
i'm
saying
it
seems
to
me
that's
your
best
argument,
but
there's
a
flaw
in
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
rejected
that
as
to
post-'85
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
your
time
is
running
short.
this
is
very
important.
i
think
you
misunderstood
justice
souter's
question.
he
asked
you
to
give
us
an
example
of
the
kansas
versus
colorado
approach
as
to
the
10-year
model.
you
answered
him
about
the
interest.
could
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--could
you
tell
us
really--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--give
us
an
example
of
the
difference
between
the
two.
