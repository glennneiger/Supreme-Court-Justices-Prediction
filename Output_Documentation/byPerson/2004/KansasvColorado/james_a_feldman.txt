mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
that...
that
we
agree
with
colorado
and
with
the
special
master
that
a
river
master
should
not
be
appointed
in
this
case.
the
compact
between
the
states
of
kansas
and
colorado
sets
up
a
commission
that
is
responsible
for
implementing
the
obligations
in
that
compact,
which
has
to
do
with
colorado's
obligations
to
deliver
a
certain
amount
of
water
to
kansas.
the
commission
is
also
charged
with
investigating
violations
of
the
compact,
and
the
compact
includes
a
dispute
resolution
mechanism
of
submission
to
binding
arbitration
if
the...
the
states
agree
to
that.
the...
the
commission
also
certainly
could
use
other
dispute
resolution
mechanisms
and
certainly
would
have
the
authority
to
do
if
it
wanted
to.
the
states
have
agreed
to
that.
congress
has
enacted
it
into
law,
and
this
court
should
permit
the
parties
to
use
that
mechanism
to
resolve
any
disputes
that
might
arise
in
the
future
rather
than
putting
a
river
master
in
place
under
the
authority
of
this
court.
now,
the
court
has...
itself
has
frequently
stated
that
consensual
resolution
of
disputes
of
this
sort
is
preferable
to
litigation.
as
the
special
master
pointed
out,
in
the
two
river
basins
just
north
of
the
arkansas
river,
the
republican
river
and
the
platte
river,
the
parties
recently,
after
having
a
dispute,
including
these
very
same
two
states
in
one
of
them,
have
come
to
a
consensual
resolution
of
the
dispute
that
they
had.
and
i
think
that
does
show,
as
the
special
master
pointed
out,
that
these...
the
states
can...
in
fact,
the
disputes
in
those
cases
also
had
to
do
with
groundwater
and
the
effect
of
well
pumping,
among
other
things.
as
the
special
master
pointed
out,
i
think
that
shows
that
the
states
can
use
a
consensual
mechanism
to
come
to
a
resolution,
and
this
court
ought
to
continue
its
often-stated
preference
for
consensual
rather
than
litigative
type
of
solutions
to
problems
of
this
sort.
if
the
court
were
to
appoint
a
river
master
in
this
case,
then
i
think
the
question
would
arise
in
any
future
case
in
which
you
have
two
states
that
have
conflicting
interests
with
regard
to
an
ongoing
activity,
as
what
happened
with
river
compacts,
equitable
apportionments,
and
in
other
areas,
whenever
there's
an
inherently
conflicting
interest,
the
court
would
have
an
appeal
that
it
should
appoint
a
master
to
oversee
a
decree
or
judgment.
and
i
think
rather
than...
that...
that
would
be
directly
contrary
to
the
court's
other
statement
in
the
area,
which
is
not
only
that
the
court
prefers
and
that
it's
far
preferable
to
have
consensual
resolutions,
but
also
that
the
court
does
not
favor
appointing
agents
or
functionaries
to
carry
out
its
decrees.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
the
pecos
river...
i
mean,
there
were
a
couple
of
differences,
in
addition
to
the
ones
that
mr.
robbins
pointed
out.
one
difference
is
that
not
only
the
special
master,
but
the
parties
in
the
pecos
river
case...
neither
party
objected
to
the
appointment
of
a
river
master
or
even
to
the
more
extraordinary
step
of
clothing
the
master
with
authority
to
make
determinations
that
would
be
reviewable
only
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
party
that
objects
to
it.
and
i
would...
i
think
there's
another
difference
that's
important
that
the
court
ought
to
keep
in
mind.
at
the
time
the
pecos
river
master
was
appointed,
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
53(e),
which
the
court
has
said
that
the
federal
rules
provide
a
guide
for
this
court's
original
cases,
rule
53(e)
provided
that
findings
of
fact
by
a
master
appointed
by
a
district
court
shall
be
reviewed
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
and
the
court,
indeed,
used
that
mechanism
for
the...
it
provided
that
the
river
master
in
that
case
would
be
reviewed
under
that
standard.
as
of
2003,
rule
53...
it's
now
rule
53(g)...
provides
that
masters
appointed
by
district
courts
said
their
findings
shall
be
reviewable
only
under
a
de
novo
standard
unless
the
parties
agree
otherwise.
therefore,
at
the
present
time...
and
again,
following
the
court's
rule
17.2
that
says
that
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
should
be
guides...
and
i
think
they
are
a
useful
guide...
the
appropriate
course
here,
if
the
court
were
to
appoint
a
river
master,
would
be
to
appoint
one
whose
findings
will
be
reviewable
de
novo.
but
that
itself
raises
problems
because
if
the
findings
of
the
river
master
are
reviewable
de
novo,
it's
really
just
a
continuation
of
the
current
litigation
and
it
doesn't
really
advance
things
any.
the
parties
will
submit
the
evidence
to
the
river
master.
he'll
make
his
determinations,
and
then
they'll
come
to
the
court.
that's
really
more
what
the
special
master
does
at
the
current
time.
so
i
think
that
under
all
of
those
circumstances,
both
the
court's
preference
for
a
consensual
resolution
of
disputes,
its
disfavoring
of
appointments
of
agents
to
carry
out
its
decrees,
the
court's
recognition
that
it's
the
court's
obligation
to
decide
cases
of
this
sort
and
it
can't...
it's
not
the
obligation
of
other
parties
to
do
that,
and
the
commission
that
congress
has
put
into
place
specifically
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
problem,
and
with
a
specific
recognition
that
there
could
be
disputes
and
a
provision
for
a
dispute
resolution,
i
think
that
the
court
should
not
appoint
a
river
master
in
this
case.
as
far
as
the
prejudgment
interest
issue,
it's
the
position
of
the
united
states
also
that
the
special
master
and
colorado
are
correct,
and
prejudgment
interest
should
not
be
awarded.
i
think
it's
a
familiar
principle
in...
to
this
court
in
litigation
that
if
a
party...
when
the
time
comes
to
make
objections,
a
party
has
to
make
all
of
its
objections
if
it
wants
the
court
to
hear
them.
in
this
case,
the
special
master
came
up
with
a
recommendation
in
his
third
report
about
how
to...
what
should
happen
with
prejudgment
interest,
under
which
the
early
years...
the...
the
amount
of
the
damages
in
those
early
years
would
never
be
subject
to
prejudgment
interest.
now,
kansas
objected
to
that
and
said
we
should
move
the
year
back
to
1950.
we
should
get
prejudgment
interest
on
everything
back
to
year
one.
but
they
never
made
the
objection
that
if
you...
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that,
which
it
did,
that
the
method
that
the
master
had
used
to
deal
with
the
prejudgment
interest
as
of
1969
was
incorrect.
that
was
the
time
that
kansas
should
have
brought
it
to
the
court
and
kansas
didn't
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
i
actually
think
it's
a
combination
of
two
things.
on
the
one
hand,
what
the
court
actually
said
in
its
opinion
was
that
the
special
master
had
awarded
damages
only
insofar
as
necessary
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
equity,
something
to
that
effect.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
in
the
normal
contract
case
that
doesn't
have
the
kinds
of
equities
that
this
case
had,
that
is
the
current
rule,
that
prejudgment
interest
would
run.
but
this
kind
of
case
involves
damages
that
go
back
50-odd
years.
it
could
have
been--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
they're...
they're
ongoing
that
are
different
in
amount
in
every
year,
that
it's
not
merely
that
colorado
was
violating
the
compact
as
of
1950,
although
it
probably
didn't
know
it
at
that
time,
but
that
kansas
didn't
bring
a
suit
until
1985
and
the
fact,
i
think,
that
colorado
has
always
agreed
to
pay...
to
adjust
the
damages
for
inflation.
so,
in
essence,
kansas
is
getting
a
portion
of
what
the
prejudgment
interest
would
normally
cover
for
those
early
years.
i
think
if
all
that's
put
together,
i
think
the
court's
conclusion
that
the
master's
conclusion
was
just
the
amount
that
equity
dictates
was
correct,
and
that
if
kansas
didn't
like
that,
it
should--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
the
government
doesn't
have
a
position
on
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
issue
involves
the
particularities
of
this
case
and
the
government
doesn't
really
have
a
particular
interest
in
how
that
gets
resolved.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
the
argument.
