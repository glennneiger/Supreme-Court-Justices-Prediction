mr.
draper,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i...
i
looked
at
these
papers
a
while
ago.
i
thought
they
did
it
on
a
10-year
basis
and
they
just
moved
it
up
each
year,
using
a
different
10
years
to
calculate
the...
the
relevant
amounts
in
the
10th
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
do
use
10
years
of
figures
to
determine
what
the
relevant
year's
water
would
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
draper,
could
i
ask
you
what
is
a
matter
of
procedure?
what
is
your
understanding
of...
of
how
one
would
go
about
challenging
the
river
master's
decision
if
one
disagreed
with
it?
do
you
go
to
the
special
master?
do
you
come
direct
to
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
directly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
because
you
may
not
bother
to
talk
about
it
otherwise,
about
punitive
damages?
your
opponent
didn't
seem
to
think
it
very
important,
but
i
have
this
question.
is
it
your
view
that
the
other
state
waived
its
claim
to
the
punitive
damages
from
1985
back
either
by
not
arguing
it
today
or
by
submitting
the
different
set
of
figures
at
the
time
the...
the
issue
was
before
the
master
the
last
time
around?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he...
did
he
make
that
suggestion
or
did
the
other...
did
kansas
make
that
suggestion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
time
around
or
in
the
preceding--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
the
master's
methodology
really
wasn't
at
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
issue
before
us,
as
i
remember
it,
was
the
date
from
which
the
prejudgment
interest
would
run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's...
that's
all
that
was
argued.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
it
had
been
a
fixed
sum
rather
than
an...
a
changing
amount
as
years
went
by,
that
clearly
we
would
have...
the
interest
would
have
run
on
the
existing
liability.
but
it's
an
unusual
case
because
the
damages
are
changing
as
time
goes
by.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
did
we...
your...
your
view
is
that
we
entirely
eliminated
any
interest
on
that
past
damage.
justice
john
paul
stevens
pre-1985.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
our
opinion
didn't
say
it
was
just
post-'85
damages.
our...
our
opinion
didn't...
didn't
answer
the
question,
and...
and
the
reason,
of
course,
is
we
didn't
actually
think
about
it
because
nobody
even...
nobody
argued
it
at
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
a
way
you
really
are
arguing
waiver
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
consistent
with
his
failure
to
argue
it
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
arguing
they've
waived
the...
your
argument
is
they
waived
the
objection
basically.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
used
the
word
waiver
in
your
brief,
and
i
don't
think
that
colorado
did
either.
but
i
guess
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
not
agree
that
if
it
was
a
one-shot
injury,
not
an
ongoing
injury,
that
the
normal
reading
would
be
the
injury...
the
interest
should
run
on
the
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
involves
continuing,
ongoing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
breyer
has
an
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce.
