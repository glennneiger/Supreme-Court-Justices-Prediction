justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
the
question
was
what
about
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
it
right
then
that...
let's
imagine
the
special
river
master's
name
is
mr.
smith,
and
unlike
me,
he
knows
about
this
stuff.
and
he
then...
you...
kansas
wants
mr.
smith
to
decide
a
certain
number
of
issues.
call
them
issues
on
page
1,
whatever
they
are.
and
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
your
client
would
say
i'm
happy
to
have
mr.
smith.
just
don't
call
him
a
river
master.
call
him
an
arbitrator.
so
you're
saying
that
when
kansas
says
they
would
do
it
except
there's
a
problem
of
getting
unanimity,
you
say
the
only
problem
is
that
you
won't
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
they're
the
obstacle
to
unanimity.
so
the
keys
are
in
their
own
pocket
if
they
want
mr.
smith.
that's
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
problem
can't
be
one
of
unanimity
because
your
side
agrees.
i
mean,
you
heard
what
he
said.
so
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
see--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and...
and
in
that
forum,
you
will
agree
to
binding
arbitration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
case
is
kansas
versus
colorado,
maybe
i
should
say
the
most
recent
chapter
in
that
long,
ongoing
saga,
is
an
original
action
between
kansas
and
colorado
about
the
division
of
the
waters
of
the
arkansas
river.
the
river
begins
in
the
rockies;
it
goes
across
farmland
in
eastern
colorado
in
kansas
and
it
end
up
in
the
mississippi.
in
the
19th
century,
there
were
journalists
who
called
it
the
nile
of
america.
i
guess
they
thought
it
was
fertile
and
in
the
20th
century
it
has
been
a
fertile
source
of
litigation.
in
1985,
kansas
said
colorado
had
violated
an
interstate
compact
by
taking
too
much
water
for
irrigation.
we
appointed
a
special
master.
the
special
master
agreed
with
kansas
and
we
did
too.
and
it
went
back
to
the
master
who
calculated
damages
and
he
came
up
with
various
conclusion
and
we
agreed
with
him
again
except
for
one
matter
having
to
do
with
how
you
calculate
pre-judgment
interest.
he
wanted
to
set
that
running
as
of
1969.
we
said
it
should
run
beginning
in
1985.
now,
we
sent
it
back
again
and
there
is
more
issues
that
he
determined
and
kansas
has
made
six
objections
to
those
issues
and
we
overrule
all
of
those
objections
today
except
the
special
master’s
recommendations.
first,
kansas
asked
us
to
appoint,
i
will
summarize
them
very
briefly,
asked
us
to
appoint
a
river
master
to
decide
various
further
technical
disputes.
we
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
disputes
and
thought
in
light
of
their
policy
as
well
as
technological
mix,
we
would
deny
the
request
for
a
special
master.
then
kansas
wanted
us
to
calculate
the
post
1985,
remember
pre-judgment
interest
started
in
1985,
but
kansas
says
yes
it
does
start
then
but
it
should
be
calculated
on
the
amounts
that
were
pre-85
as
well
as
post-85.
we
looked
at
our
last
decision,
we
looked
at
the
special
master’s
analysis
of
how
we
got
there
and
we
concluded
that
the
amounts
that
are
pre-85
should
also
be
exempt
from
pre-judgment
interest
and
so
the
whole
begins
on
’85
and
after
’85
amounts.
then
kansas
pointed
out
that
the
damages
rest
on
the
use
of
a
very,
very
complicated
hydrological
institutional
model.
it
is
called
the
hi
model.
i
will
spare
you
the
details
but
it
tries
to
measure
every
drop
of
water
that
comes
into
kansas
and
that
goes
out
that
is
relevant.
rain,
everything.
then
they
worked
with
the
model
and
they
tried
to
figure
out
how
much
of
it
is
really
attributable
to
the
colorado
digging
too
much
which
they
were
not
supposed
to
dig
too
many
wells.
kansas
says
in
the
future,
look
at
the
results
year
by
year.
but
the
special
master
said
if
we
do
that,
it
is
going
to
be
too
erroneous
because
the
model
is
only
accurate
if
you
look
at
10-years
batches.
but
we
said
all
right;
that
is
what
we
think
is
true,
that
is
what
they
should
do,
10
years.
now,
kansas
raises
three
more
matters.
they
are
still
more
technical.
i
won't
go
into
them
but
for
reasons
that
we
set
forth
in
the
opinion,
we
agree
in
each
instance
with
the
special
master.
finally,
we
note
that
the
special
master
recommended
the
use
of
consultation,
mediations
and
arbitration
in
respect
to
future
disputes
which
in
the
master’s
view
are
likely
to
be
very
technical
in
nature.
noting
our
argument
today,
we
would
drink
to
that.
kansas'
exceptions
are
overruled.
the
special
master’s
recommendations
are
adopted.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
