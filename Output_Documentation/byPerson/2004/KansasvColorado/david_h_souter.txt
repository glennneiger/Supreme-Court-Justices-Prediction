justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
that
statement.
you
say
it
would
be
available
to
be
used
as
a
credit
in
a
subsequent
year.
do
you
really
mean
it
would
be
used
as
a
credit,
or
do
you
mean
it
would
simply
be
there
to
be
used?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
difference--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
what
can...
what
can
the
river
master
do
that
the...
that
the
commission
or
authority
can't
do?
i...
is
the
difference
between
the
two
of
them...
call
it
a
jurisdictional
difference...
nil,
but
there
is
process
difference
in
the
sense
that
the
river
master
could
say
do
this
or
don't
do
that,
whereas
your...
your
fear
is
that
the
authority
is
simply
going
to
be
deadlocked
because
everything
has
to
be
done
unanimously?
is
it
a
process
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
for
that,
you
wouldn't
be
asking
for
a
river
master
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
yes.
your
state
agreed
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you...
you
agree
that
this
is
the...
the
authority
here
is
more
than
a
keep-in-touch
group.
your
problem
with
it
is...
is
not
that
you
need
something
more
than
keep
in
touch,
but
that
when
you
ask
them
to
do
something
more
than
keep
in
touch,
the
other
state
has
a
veto.
and...
and
that
simply
gets
you
to
justice
scalia's
objection.
that's
the
deal
you
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
colorado
still
has
the
veto
in
any
given
case
on
whether
an
arbitrator
will
be
appointed.
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
give...
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
dispute.
can
you
give
me
in...
in...
without
using
up
all
of
your
time,
a...
basically
a
simple
example
to
illustrate
the
difference
between
the
two
contending
methodological
positions?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
got
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't...
why
isn't
the
result
that
you...
of...
of
your
position
that
you
would
get
a
more
accurate
set
of
predictions
if
all
you
were
making
was
a
10-year
calculation,
but
you
will
not
get
a
more
accurate
set
of
predictions
with
respect
to
any
one
year?
and
in
fact,
it
is
with
respect
to
any
one
year
that's
important
under
the
compact.
in
other
words,
they...
they
plan
every
year,
not
every
10
years.
so
why
does
a
10-year
accuracy
help
you
in
solving
the
practical
problem
you
have
on
a
year-to-year
basis?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know.
but
it's
used
on
the
basis
of
10-year
figures
which
will
not
be
accurate
particularly
with
respect
to
any
given
year
even
though
they
would
be...
they
would
be
accurate
if
you
were
only
interested
in
a
calculation
every
10
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it...
can...
can
you...
can
you
get
a
better
prediction
on
a
year-to-year
basis
is
what
i'm
saying.
