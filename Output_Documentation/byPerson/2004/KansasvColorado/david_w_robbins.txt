mr.
david
w.
robbins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
will
begin
by
discussing
the
river
master
since
that's
where
mr.
draper
left
off.
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
first
of
all,
that
i
disagree
with
the
assertion
that
the
pecos
river
compact
and
the
arkansas
river
compact
are
similar
in
the
way
they
operate.
the
pecos
river
compact
did,
in
fact,
specifically
state
that
it
was...
it
intended
to
hold
the
level
of...
of
depletion
of
the
system
by
man's
development
to
the
1947
condition.
the
arkansas
river
compact,
to
the
contrary,
begins
the...
the
limitation
clause
by
saying
it
is
not
intended
to
impede
or
prevent
future
beneficial
development
of
the
arkansas
basin,
provided
that
the
waters
of
the
arkansas
river
are
not
materially
depleted
in
useable
quantity
for
existing
use
for
the
uses.
so
the...
the
arkansas
compact
contemplated
that
there
would
be
a...
a
more
flexible
effort
at
using
the
water
of
the
river
by
water
users
in
both
states,
protecting
the
existing
uses
in
both
states
from
that
future
development.
now,
this...
this
court
has
appointed
a
river
master
in
two
circumstances.
in
both
circumstances,
as
pointed
out
by
justice
ginsburg,
the...
the
special
master
recommended
that
because
of
the
specific
circumstances
of
the
case,
that
in
fact
a
river
master
was
appropriate.
that
was
on
the
delaware
river
and
the
pecos
river.
in
all
other
cases
that
deal
with
this
issue
where
requests
have
been
made
by...
by
states
without
river...
without
a
special
master's
recommendation,
the
court
has
declined
to
appoint
a
river
master.
there's
a
very
good
reason,
i
think,
behind
that.
colorado
alone
is
the
party
denying
interstate
compacts
in
two
equitable
apportionment
decrees.
if
every
time
a
state
is
dissatisfied
with
its
neighbor,
is
dissatisfied
with
how
a
compact
operates,
it
is
able
to
come
to
this
court
and
say,
please
appoint
a
river
master,
we're
just
having
trouble
with
our
neighbor,
you'll
become
the
water
management...
the
super
water
management
agency
for
the
country.
you
have
river
masters
if
you...
it's
totally
up
to...
to
your
discretion.
but
if
you
were
to
follow
this
line
of
thinking,
you
end
up
supervising
water
distribution
across
the
west
and
part
of
the
east.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
justice
scalia,
that
is
absolutely
correct,
but
the
difference
is
where
compacts
have
mechanisms
within
them
that
are
designed
to
work
out
these
differences,
i
think
it
is
in
the
court's
interest...
and
colorado's
position
is
and
the
special
master's
position
was
it
was
in
the
court's
interest...
to
refer
these
matters
back
to
those
compact
administrations.
you--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--justice
o'connor,
i
agree
completely
with
the
special
master.
the
state
of
colorado
has
proposed,
as
referred
to
in
his
ruling,
that
binding
arbitration
be
used
and
has
committed
itself
to
participate
in
that.
to
the
extent
there...
there
have
been
past
conflicts,
colorado
has
said
let's
get
them
behind
us.
let's
return
to
the
compact,
congressionally
sanctioned
method
for
resolving
our
differences,
and
let's
proceed
down
the
road.
we
will--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--that
is...
under
the
compact,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
and
so...
but...
but
colorado
has
made
a...
a
very
clear
commitment
to
the
special
master
and
does
so
to
this
court
that
if
arbitration
is
proposed,
colorado
would
participate.
we
do
not
as
a
state
find
it
very
acceptable
to
spend
the
time,
money,
and
effort
to
litigate
these
issues.
after
all,
we
have
farmers.
kansas
has
farmers.
we
need
to
get
back
to
getting
the
water
equitably
resolved
through
the
compact
mechanism.
that
is
our
proposal.
it
was--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--at
the
present
time,
that's
the
posture--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--our
view
is
if
they
want
to
arbitrate
pursuant
to
the
compact,
the
keys
are
in
their...
in
their
pocket.
we
do
not
believe--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--our
side
agrees,
your...
justice
breyer,
with...
with
the
concept
that
this
matter
should
be
returned
to
the
compact
administration
to
resolve
the
differences
in
that
forum.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
in
that
forum,
we
will
agree
to
binding
arbitration.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
yes,
it
will.
[laughter]
i
want...
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
colorado,
different
than
the
situation
in
the
pecos
river,
acted
very
aggressively
to
ensure
that
it
promptly
came
into
compliance
with
the...
with
the
determination
that
in
fact
depletions
were
occurring,
impermissible
depletions
were
occurring
to
the
arkansas
river.
within
2
years,
the
state
of
colorado's
legislature
had
passed
the
appropriate
legislation.
the
state
engineer
had
passed
rules
and
regulations,
implemented
them,
and
enforced
them.
the
state
had
authorized
millions
of
dollars
in
loans
for
the
acquisition
of
replacement
water,
and...
and
the
state
of
colorado...
your...
your
ruling
was
in
1995.
by
1997,
it
appears
that
the
state
of
colorado
was
in
compliance
with
the
compact.
that
is
a
significant
and
very
difficult
effort
on
the
part
of
the
legislature,
the
governor,
the
attorney
general,
and
the
state
engineer.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
anything
like
the
pecos
river.
your
master
in
this
case
has
not
said
to
you
these
parties
are...
are
torn,
will
not
get
together,
and
you
need
to
have
a
master,
a
river
master,
appointed.
in
this
instance,
the
state
of
colorado
took
the
exact
opposite
approach.
they
did
everything
they
could
to
reduce
the
pumping
of
the
wells
sufficiently
to
allow
colorado
to
meet
the
terms
of
the
compact,
and
that
is
an
important
fact
you
need
to
glean
from
the
special
master's
report.
now,
the...
the
other...
the
only
other
point
i
want
to
make
on
this
is
that
the...
the...
it's...
it's
very
important,
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
river
master
is
the
appropriate
course
of
action
to
determine...
and
i...
i
mentioned
this
earlier...
whether
or
not
the
court
wants
to
be
in
a
supervisory
position.
i
happen
to
agree
that
the
states
are
entitled
to
seek
redress
of
their
concerns
before
this
court,
and
as
you
said
in...
in
oklahoma
v.
new
mexico,
you
have
a
serious
obligation
to
adjudicate
disputes
between
the
states
where
there
are
actual
and
existing
controversies.
and...
and
the
fact
that
you
would
have
a
river
master
would
not
eliminate
the
potential
for
those
controversies.
in
our
view,
the
only
way
that
you
can
get
this
matter
off
of
your
plate
and
into
the
position
that
congress
recognized
and...
and
directed
is
to
follow
the
special
master's
recommendation
number
12.
i'd
now
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
issue
of
the
accuracy
of
the
model.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
justice
stevens,
in
response
to
your
question,
we
believe
that
in
fact
the
issue
of
prejudgment
interest,
or
punitive
damages,
is
law
of
the
case
in
this
matter.
the
special
master
set
out
a
formula
by
which
he
proposed
how
the
damages
should
be
calculated.
kansas
argued
for
actual
value
of
money,
a
rather
rigid
theory
of
compensation,
and
the
special
master
chose
in
fact
a
balancing
of
the
equities
approach.
he
suggested
that
the
appropriate
means
to
calculate
those...
that
prejudgment
interest
on
the...
the
nominal
damages--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--the
special
master
ruled
on
how
he
believed
the
damages
should
be
calculated.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
in
the
preceding
time
around.
and
what
he
said
was
that
the
damages
from
1950
to
1968
should
be...
should...
should
receive
a
inflationary
increase
to
reflect
the
inflationary
tendencies,
but
that
they
should
not
be
dealt
with
under
prejudgment
interest.
in
other
words,
it
shouldn't
be
compounded
through
prejudgment
interest.
only
the
damages
from
1969
forward
should
be
compounded
using
prejudgment
interest.
kansas
did
not
except
to
that
methodology.
kansas
excepted
to
the
fact
that
he
didn't
give
them
prejudgment
interest
on
the
damages
from
1950
forward.
in
the
opinion
that
you
authored
for
the
court,
you
accepted
the
master's
methodology,
and
you
did
one
thing
and
only
one.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
the
master's--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--that's--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--it
is
and
i
agree
with
you,
justice
stevens.
it
is
an
unusual
case.
but
the...
the
critical
element
here
is
that
the
master
was
looking
for
an
equitable
way
to
arrive
at
a
damage
sum.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
this...
this
go-round?
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
it
isn't
the...
if
i
may,
justice
kennedy,
it
isn't
the--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--i
understand.
the...
but
the...
in
our
view
the
state
of
kansas
was
obligated
to
take
an
exception
if
it
disagreed
with
the
methodology
used
by
the
special
master
and
adopted
in
justice
stevens'
opinion
by
this
court.
there
was
a
sum
of
damage
that
was
calculated
by
that
and
reported
to
the
court:
$38
million.
by
moving
the
year
forward
from
1969
to
1985,
you
automatically
then
reduce,
by
some
degree,
the
amount
of
that
damage
calculation.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
prejudgment--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--the...
the
special
master's
methodology,
justice
stevens,
was
that
the
damages
in
his
third
report
from
1950
to
1968
should
not,
under
a
balancing
of
the
equities,
bear
prejudgment
interest
at
any
point
in
time.
they
should
only
be
advanced
for
inflation,
which
was
a
proposal
colorado
made
because
colorado
believed
that
it...
the
changing
a
1950
damage
to
a...
to
a
2002,
or
at
that
time
a
1994,
dollar
value
was
only
fair
and
reasonable.
we
opposed
the
concept
of
giving
prejudgment
interest
because
it
would...
it
would
be...
it's
as
if...
if
this
were
a
commercial
context,
we
would
have
been
able
to
identify
that
there
was
a
damage
going
on
and
the
theory
in
your
prejudgment
cases
is
we
could
have
put
the
money
in
the
bank--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--you
agreed
that
prejudgment
interest,
justice
kennedy,
should
be
applied
to
post-'85
damages,
not
to
pre-'85
damages.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
our
view
was
that...
that...
our
view
is,
justice
stevens,
that
an
exception
needed
to
be
taken
if
the
master's
methodology
was
under
challenge.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
we
are
arguing
law
of
the
case.
yes,
we
are.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
that's...
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to,
if...
if
i
may,
move
off
of
prejudgment
interest.
i
would
like
to
talk,
while
i
still
have
a
few
minutes,
a
little
bit
about
this
model
and
the
10-year
average.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
yes,
i
can,
justice
souter.
under
the...
the
master's
formulation,
which
is
agreed
to
by
colorado,
the
damages
which
occur
in
each
year,
1950
through
1984,
are...
are
computed
at...
in...
as
nominal
damages
in
the
year
in
which
they
occur.
they
are
then
expanded
by
the...
by
an
inflationary
formula
which
allows
the
dollar
in
1950
to
be
calculated
in
a
2002
dollar.
in
1985
and
to
the
present,
any
damages
that
occur
are
advanced
both
for
inflation,
but
then
they
are
also
awarded
a
prejudgment
interest,
which
is
compounded.
in
other
words,
if
inflation
is
2
or
3
percent
through
the
period
on
a
long-term
average,
but...
but
investments
are
at
6
or
7
percent--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--those
damages
advance.
colorado's...
kansas'
view
is
that
commencing
in...
in
1985,
all
of
the
damages
from
1950
to
the
present
should
receive
prejudgment
interest.
the
difference
then
becomes,
if
you
use
the
master's
methodology,
the...
the
current
amount
of
money
in
2002
dollars
which
colorado
would
owe
kansas
is
approximately
$29
million.
if
you
use
the
kansas
methodology...
and
this
is
the
impact
of
prejudgment
interest...
it
would
be
$52
million.
under
the
original
formulation
that
was
presented
to
the
court,
the
value
under
the
master's
formulation,
which
did
not
charge
prejudgment
interest
on
the
'50
to
'68
dollars,
both
states
agreed
that
that
would
have
been
$38
million.
so
from
colorado's
perspective,
having
succeeded
in
our...
in
our
exception
that
the
year
should
be
1985
instead
of
1969,
we
in
fact,
under
the
kansas
theory,
lose
some
20-some-million
in
the
proposition,
which
we
don't
believe
is
what
the
court
intended.
let
me...
let
me
turn
very
quickly
to
the
model,
if
i
may.
the...
the
issue
here
is
not
colorado's
obligation
to
deliver
water
to...
to
the
river
system.
colorado
has
both
senior
surface
water
rights
and
the
state
of
kansas
that
it
has
obligations
to
protect.
remember,
the
compact
envisions
that
this
subsequent
development
can't
injure
water
users
in
either
kansas
or
colorado.
as
a
result,
colorado
must
ensure
that
on
a
monthly
basis,
water
is
placed
into
the
river
so
depletions
are...
are
compensated
for
in
the
system
as
they
occur.
the
problem
here
is
not
that
process.
the
problem
here
is
a
model
that
is
inaccurate.
beginning
in
your
first
report,
you
quoted
with
favor
the
special
master's
comments
about
this
model
in
dealing
with
the
winter
water
storage
program,
which
was
an
issue
which
you
agreed
should
be
dismissed
several
years
ago.
you
indicated
that
depletions
shown
were
well
within
the
range
of
error
and
it
could
not
be
told
if
it
was
an
impact
or
an
error
that
the
model
was
describing.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
i'm
so
sorry.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
yes.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
yes.
the
difference
between
the
two
is
this.
we
believe
that
the
model
over
a
long
period
of
time,
as
it's
developer,
mr.
durbin,
said,
is
reasonably
accurate.
we...
we
agree
with
that,
and
we
are
willing
to
use
it
like
that.
but
that
means
you
have
to
use...
look
at
it
over
extended
periods
of
time.
our
view
is
that
you
simply
look
at
the
model,
which
is
predicting
over-deliveries
and
under-deliveries,
predicting
them.
they
don't
have
any
relationship
to
what
colorado
is
really
putting
into
the
system.
they
are
predictions.
and
in
some
years
where
you...
where
you
look
back
and
you
know
from
the
gauges
the
model
is
over-predicting
a
significant
amount,
you...
you
want
to
be...
and
you
know
in
a
subsequent
year
it's
going
to
under-predict,
you
want
to
allow
that
to
smooth
out
so
that
you
are,
in
fact,
getting
close
to
what's
really
going
on.
it
is
not
an
effort
to
carry
dry-year
depletions
into
wet
years
or
vice
versa.
it
is,
in
fact,
an
effort
to
allow
the
model's
inherent
inaccuracies
to
play
out
so
that
you
get
a
more
accurate
result
in
each
10th
year.
mr.
david
w.
robbins
as
proposed
by
the
special
master,
the
model
is
not
used
every
10
year...
or
every
10th
year.
it's
used
every
year.
if
you're
looking
at--
mr.
david
w.
robbins
--you
are
making--
mr.

--you
get
a
better
prediction
on
a
year-to-year
basis.
a...
a
better
prediction
if
you're
looking
at
the
model
over
10
years
versus
looking
at
the
model
just
running
it
in
a
given
year.
colorado
does
not
want
to
be
in
a
position,
justice
souter,
where
we
are
accused
of
violating
the
compact
because
there
is
an
inaccuracy
in
the
tool
that
is
being
used.
