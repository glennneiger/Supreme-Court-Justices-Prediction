mr.
john
b.
draper
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
kansas
would
like
to
address
three
issues
today.
50
years
of
success
of
the
court's
river
master
on
the
delaware
river
and
16
years
of
success
of
the
court's
river
master
on
the
pecos
river
demonstrate
the
wisdom
of
appointing
a
river
master
under
appropriate
circumstances
on
a
river
like
the
arkansas
river,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
secondly,
the
court
should
affirm
the
neutral
principle
that
prejudgment
interest
accrues
on
all
damages
owing
at
the
time
interest
begins
to
run.
and
third,
a
1-year
compliance
period
would
be
consistent
with
the
court's
prior
rulings
in
this
case
and
would
preserve
an
essential
right
of
kansas
and
its
farmers
under
this...
this
compact
that
would
otherwise
be
lost
under
the
master's
recommendation
of
a
10-year
accounting
period.
with
respect
to
this
accounting
period,
i
would
note
that
in
both
prior
opinions
in
this
case,
this
court
has
relied
on
the
annual
results
of
the
hydrologic-institutional
model,
which
is
the
standard
for
compact
compliance
in
this
case.
in
the
first
opinion
in
1995,
this
court
distinguished
between
monthly
and...
and
seasonal
use
of
the
model,
deciding
that
monthly
use
was
too
frequent,
but
that
seasonal
reliance
on
the
model
for
determining
useability
under
article
iv-d
of
the
compact
was
reasonable.
when
the
case
was
back
here
in
2001,
this
court
reviewed
the
calculation
of
damages,
which
was
done
on
a
yearly
basis.
as
you
can
imagine,
the
factors
that
go
into
calculation
of
damages
vary
from
year
to
year,
and
so
it
is
crucial
whether
the
depletions
calculated
by
the
h-i
model,
as
it's
called,
are
accurate,
sufficiently
accurate,
and
reasonable
to
rely
upon
on
an
annual
basis.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
a
moving
accumulation
of
10
years
of
results.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the...
the
annual
determination
includes
the
most
current
year
for
which
there
is
data
and
the
previous
9
years,
adds
all
those
up,
nets
out
the
pluses
and
minuses,
and
that
determines
whether
in
the
year
in
question
there
is
compliance
with
the
compact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
the
special
master's
proposal,
yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more
in
the
sense
that
we
should
begin
now
with
the
accounting
so
that
you
look
each
year
at
the
results
of
this
standard,
which
has
been
approved
by
the
court,
for
compact
compliance
in
that
year
only,
and
if...
if
you
accumulate
it--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--your
honor,
averages
will
tend
to
smooth
out
the
results
and
will
hide
the
effects
during
dry
years,
which
is
when
the
farmers
in
kansas,
who
are
the
beneficiaries
that
kansas
intended
to
benefit...
and
both
parties
realize
that.
they
need
this
water--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--your
honor,
i
believe
the...
the
result
is
the...
is
the
opposite.
if
i
may
explain.
the
model,
the...
the
hydrologic-institutional
model,
has
been
made
as
unbiased
as
possible.
the
one
aspect
in
which
we
have
identified
a
bias
is
that
it
favors
colorado
during
dry
years.
it
tends
to
underestimate
the
depletions
that
would
have
to
be
replaced
by
colorado.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we
don't
believe
that
aspect
of
the
model
would
be
any
different
if
we're
doing
it
year
by
year.
we'd
simply
be
taking
the
results
that
are
calculated
each
year
under
either
approach
and
use
those
in
that
year
so
that
if
you
have
a
dry
year,
you
are...
are
calculating
in
that
year
whether
there
is
compliance
and
staying
as
close
as
possible
to
the
true
intent
of
the
compact,
which
is
to
provide
water
when
the
farmers
need
it.
mr.
john
b.
draper
no,
your
honor.
the
longer
the
period
of
time
you
take,
the
more
the
accumulated
results
of
the
model
will
match
the
measured--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--yes,
and
i
should
point
out
that
it's
impossible
to
know
what
the
right
answer
is.
you
can...
you
can
measure
the
flows
and
the
diversions
in
the
river
and
compare
that
to
one
of
the
runs
of
this
model,
but
it's
the
difference
between
the
two
runs,
one
representing
the
compact
condition,
which
is
supposed
to
be
met,
and
the
other
representing
the
situation
with
the
wells
operating.
and
it's
the
difference
between
those
two
whose
accuracy
is
in
question.
mr.
john
b.
draper
and
no
one
knows
what
that
is.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
i
don't
understand
it
that
way.
if
you
use
10
years,
you
are
adding
to
the
most
recent
year
results
9
years
of
pluses
and
minuses
that's
going
to,
in
most
case,
mask
what
happened
during
that
next
previous
year.
you
will
be
looking
at
a
10-year
accumulation
of
ups
and
downs
and
not
analyzing
what
happened
in...
in
the
year
in
question.
mr.
john
b.
draper
not...
not
directly,
your
honor.
it...
it
does
preserve
that
reservoir
in
fact
because
depletion
of
that
reservoir
affects
the
stream
flows,
and
it's
the
stream
flows
that
are
compacted
here
and
that
have
up
to
now--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--i
think
in
general,
your
honor,
you
are...
are
correct.
the
question
about
there
are
over-deliveries
by
colorado,
i
believe
is
what
you're
addressing,
is
there...
is
there
a
way
to
give
colorado
credit
for
that.
and
there
is
a
way.
there
is
a...
a...
an
account
in
john
martin
reservoir,
which
is
60
miles
above
the
state
line,
for
those
deliveries.
when
they
are
delivered
there,
if
there
is
more
delivered
than
is
actually
needed
in
that
year
to
achieve
compact
compliance,
that
can
be
retained
there
and,
except
for
a
small
effect
of
evaporation,
is
available
to
offset
depletions
in
the
following
year.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
draper
under
those
circumstances,
the
water
that
would
be
delivered
to
this
offset
account
in
john
martin
reservoir
is
not
a
credit
that's
accounted
under
the
compact
for
that
year.
so
it
would
not
enter
into
the
compact
accounting
for
that
year.
it
would
not
constitute
a...
a
credit,
but
it
would
be
available
as
a
practical
matter
to
be
used
as
a
credit
in
the
next
year
for
current
depletions.
so
there
would
be
no
carryover
in
compact
accounting.
mr.
john
b.
draper
i
think
your
formulation,
your
honor,
is...
is
more
correct.
mr.
john
b.
draper
it
would
be
there
to
be
used,
and
it
would
not
be
a
credit
for
accounting
purposes.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
draper
this
is
under
the
assumption,
your
honor,
that
they
have
already
met
their
obligations
in
the
current
year.
mr.
john
b.
draper
and
it
will
be
available
as
a
practical
matter
to
meet
their
obligations
in
a
subsequent
year
and
be
accounted
in
that
subsequent
year.
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
very
important
for
kansas
farmers
that
the...
the
water
be
received
when
it
is
supposed
to
be
delivered
under
the
compact.
if
water
is...
is
not
delivered,
as
required,
in
one
year,
it
cannot
be
recouped
in
a
following
year,
certainly
not
10
years
later,
as
would
be
possible
under
the
special
master--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--it's
not
a
10--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--that's
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor.
and
the
model
is
inherently
a
yearly
model.
it
calculates
actually
results
on
a
monthly
basis,
and
we
have
used
it...
and
the
court
has
relied
upon
it...
on
a
yearly
basis
up
to
now.
mr.
john
b.
draper
well,
it...
it
could
be
done
that
way,
and
in
fact,
your
honor,
colorado
uses
parts
of
this
same
model
in
its
own
administration
of
groundwater
pumping,
the
same
groundwater
pumping
for
purposes
of
protecting
colorado
surface
water
users,
and
it
requires
replacement
of
water
on
a
monthly
basis.
so
it
is...
it
is
possible.
but
we
believe
with
the
yearly
accumulation
that...
that
we
have
relied
upon
so
far
in
this
case
and
that
the
court
has
relied
upon
specifically
for
damages,
that
that
is
an
appropriate
accounting
period
for
this
particular
purpose.
and
that
is...
that
is
our
proposal.
the
proposal
of
colorado
is
no,
let's
wait
10
years
before...
and...
and
accumulate
it
with
the
other
9
years
before
we
require
any
replacement.
i
would
point
out
that
the
h-i
model,
the
hydrologic-institutional
model,
is
the
best
tool
available
for
this
purpose.
it
was
endorsed
by
colorado
after
the
court's
first
opinion
in
this
case
when
it...
the
court
approved
using
the
model
on
a
seasonal
basis
for
the
seasonal
accounting
of
useability.
at
that
time,
colorado
gave
up
its
own
model
in
favor
of
the
hydrologic-institutional
model,
and
as
you
can
see
from
the
master's
report,
there
have
been
several
significant
improvements
in
the
model
since
that
time.
i
would
also
point
out
the
correspondence...
the
close
correspondence
that
exists
between
this
case
and
the
pecos
river
litigation
in
the
1980's.
there
you
had
a
compact
that
like
this
compact
did
not
specify
any
specific
quantity
of
water
in
the
compact
itself,
but
indicated
that
there
was
to
be
no
depletions
beyond
the
depletions
that
were
occurring
at
the
time
of
the
compact
with
a
few
small
amendments
that
i
could...
i
could
mention.
but
the
basic
similarity
of
the
compacts
is
that
the
status
quo
at
the
time
of
the
compact
was
maintained.
there
was
an
inflow/outflow
relationship
that
needed
to
be
observed
and
was
required
to
be
observed
by
the
compact.
it
was
expressed
explicitly
in
the
pecos
river
compact
by
a
reference
to
an
inflow/outflow
method.
in
this
case,
it
was
expressed
implicitly
in
article
iv-d
of
the
compact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
john
b.
draper
with
the
description
of
the
pecos
river
master
as
being...
as
having
only
ministerial
duties,
and
i
can
explain
why.
mr.
john
b.
draper
yes.
if...
if
you
refer
to
the
appendix
of
our...
our
blue
brief,
on
page
a-22,
you
will
see
that
the
opening
section
of
the
pecos
river
master's
manual
sets
out
the
inflow/outflow
relationship
that
is
to
be
observed
in
complying
with
that
compact.
this
is
the
form
of
an
equation.
you
can
see
y
equals
and
a...
and
a
number
there.
in...
in
our
case,
we
have
the...
the
hydrologic-institutional
model,
which
benefits
from
several
decades
of
increased
sophistication
in
hydrologic
analysis
to
do
the
same
job.
mr.
john
b.
draper
he...
he
is
to
apply
the
formula,
your
honor,
but
there's
a
great
deal
of
judgment,
professional,
expert
judgment
that
needs
to
be
exercised
in
order
to
apply
it.
for
example,
you
have
to
separate
flood
flows
from
base
flows.
when
you
look
at
the...
at
the
results
of
a...
of
a
gauge
on
a
river,
you
can
see
how
much
water
was
in
the
river
at
particular
times,
but
this
has
to
be
separated
into
two
different
kinds
of
flows
that
are
treated
differently
under
this
compact.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
our
master
would
be
just
as
cheap.
[laughter]
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
no,
he
would
not
formally
interact
with
the
commission,
just
as
the
pecos
river
master
does
not
formally
interact
with
the
pecos
river
commission.
mr.
john
b.
draper
it
is
a
process
difference,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--well,
if
there
were
an
authoritative
way,
such
as
a
river
master,
by
which
the
annual
recurring
exercise
of
judgment
could
be
accomplished,
we
would
not
need
the
river
master.
but
i
don't--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--that
decision
also
requires
unanimity,
your
honor,
and
in
the
one
case
i'm
aware
of,
kansas'
suggestion
of
doing
an
arbitration
was
rejected
by
colorado.
it's...
but
it's...
it
takes
unanimity
to
do
anything
under
that
compact
administration,
including
the
arbitration
option.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
we
have
suggested
that
it
be
set
up
just
as
you
have
set
up
the
pecos
river
master.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
an
objection
to
the
determination,
the
yearly
determination,
of
the
river
master,
it
would
be
reviewable
by
this
court.
mr.
john
b.
draper
directly.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
i
believe
in
both
of
those
cases,
the...
the
special
master
was
recommending
the
appointment
of
a
river
master,
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
setting
out
the
criteria
for
appointing
a
river
master,
the
court
did
not
refer
to
that
factor
as...
as
being
part
of
the
consideration.
mr.
john
b.
draper
we're
suggesting
the
same
scope
of
review
as
on
the
pecos,
which
is
clearly
erroneous.
this,
however,
is
something
that
the
court
could
decide
to
do
differently
than
the
pecos,
but
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
comports
with
the...
the
way
master
recommendations
are
handled
in
the
district
court
under
rule
53.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
this
would
not
deprive
either
state
of
that
right.
and
in
fact--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--well,
there...
as
i
say,
the
court...
the
court
may
set
the
review
threshold
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
i
would...
i
would
say
that
we
have...
we
have
mentioned
the
clearly
erroneous
review
standard
because
it
was
in
the
pecos
framework.
it
is
not
essential
to
our
proposal.
a
de
novo
review
would
be
perfectly
fine
with
the
state
of
kansas.
mr.
john
b.
draper
as
under
the
pecos,
your
honor,
if
the...
if
the
compact
administration,
as
it's
called
in
the...
in
the
arkansas
basin,
is
able
to
come
to
a
resolution
of
an
issue,
then
that
would...
that
would
take
care
of
that
issue.
it
would
be...
not
be
necessary
to
have
the
river
master
address
that,
and
it
would
be
an
agreement
of
the
states
because
it
would
either
be
an
agreement
because
they
had
literally
agreed
before
the...
or
in
the
form
of
the
arkansas
river
compact
administration
or
that
they
had
agreed
to
binding
arbitration
and
had
settled
it.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
the
referral
of
matters
to
the
commission
is
why
we're
here
in
the
first
place.
it
cannot
act
without
unanimity.
the
state
of
colorado,
the
state
in
possession
of
this
resource,
can
veto
each
and
every
action
of
the
compact
administration.
mr.
john
b.
draper
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
an
end
run
any
more
than
the
enforcement
of
the
compact
is
an
end
run
around
the
administrative
body
that
is
set
up
in
many
of
these
compacts.
those
are
keep-in-touch
type
bodies.
if
they
can
agree
on
things,
they
are
very
useful,
and
the
arkansas
river
compact
administration
has
been
useful
in
areas
where
there
can
be
agreement.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
the...
that
is
the
nub
of
our
argument
against
reliance
on
the
arkansas
river
compact
administration,
that
you
can't
look
at
it
to
settle
differences
about
the
implementation
of
this
court's
decree.
mr.
john
b.
draper
that
is
a--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--your
honor,
i
think
he
was
talking
about
the
hope
that
he
has
that
the
states
could
work
more
cooperatively
now,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
on
this
river
between
these
two
states
that
this
court
was
first
asked
to
resolve
interstate
river
disputes
between
states
in
1901,
and
we
are
here
today
still
in
dispute
over
this
river.
mr.
john
b.
draper
nothing
tangible,
your
honor.
we...
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
the
settlement
that
we
have
achieved
on
the
republican
river.
that
case
started,
was
accepted
by
this
court.
after
rulings
by
this
court,
it
became
possible
to
settle
that
case.
it
has
now
been
settled.
and
the
states
involved
in
that
litigation
were
kansas,
nebraska,
and
colorado.
it
was
possible
in
that...
in
that
context.
it
has
proven
impossible
in
this
context.
and
we
can
expect
disputes
to
go
on,
as
they
have
over
the
last
century,
if
we
do
not
have
an
impartial
expert
authority
to
resolve
disputes
between
states
that
are
going
to
come
up
every
year.
every
year
there
are
questions.
how
do
you
take
the
data
this
year
and
put
it
into
the
h-i
model?
while
many
of
those
issues
have
been
settled,
because
different
forms
of
replacement
and
other
different
circumstances
arise,
you
have
those
every
year.
and
if
you
follow
the
lead
that
the
pecos
river
cases
of
this
court
give
us,
there
is
also
the
possibility
to
address
the
improvement
of
the
tool
for
implementing
the
agreement
of
the
states,
and
that
is
improving
the
hydrologic-institutional
model
on
occasion,
as
we
have
seen
the
master
do
over
the
course
of
this
litigation.
that
is
allowed
under
the
pecos
river
decree,
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
allowed
under
this
decree
as
well.
and
that
is
when
the
master
would
be
exercising
the
most
judgment
in
our
opinion.
i
would
conclude
by
saying
that
a...
a
river
master
is
needed
on
the
arkansas
to
deal
impartially
and
expertly
with
annual
questions
that
must
be
resolved
to
implement
the
h-i
model,
and
that
a
1-year
compliance
period
will
implement
the
intentions
of
the
drafters
of
the
compact
and
the
needs
of
kansas
farmers
and
is
consistent
with
the
yearly
reliance
that
this
court
has
already
placed
on
the
h-i
model.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
john
b.
draper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
state
that
we
do
not
believe
that
we
waived
our
position
on
the
interest
calculation
as
was
just
suggested
in
the...
in
the
last
colloquy.
the
reason
that
we
didn't
do
that
is
because
we
filed
an
exception
last
time
against
every
respect
in
which
the
special
master
was
not
recommending
full
interest.
and
it
turned
out
that
the
court
chose
the...
the
test
that
we
now
have,
which
is
a
relatively
easy
test
to
apply.
it
has
certain
incentives
that
grow
out
of
it
that
make
sense.
and
we
believe
that
we
sufficiently
excepted
to
that.
if
look
at
our
brief
from
that
exception,
the
one
in...
in
support
of
our
exceptions,
in
particular...
particularly
to
page
25,
footnote
8,
we
specifically
addressed
the
issue
that
the...
the
master
was
not
allowing
any
interest
in
that
1950
through
1968
period.
mr.
john
b.
draper
in
the
earlier
case,
to
the
third
report
of
the
special
master.
i
would...
also,
on
the
other
points
that
were
raised,
you
need
to
be--
mr.
john
b.
draper
--well,
we
were...
we
were
arguing
the
larger
issues
on
interest,
but
we
were
asking
that
interest
not
be
denied
to
us
during
that
'50
through
1968
period.
that
was
very
clear
from
our
briefs,
and
we
specifically
singled
out
that
part
of
it
in
that
footnote.
so
i
don't
believe
it's
appropriate
that...
to
conclude
that
we
have
waived
that
argument.
and
i
would
point
out
also
that
the
only
reason
that
it
was
done
that
way...
and
the
calculations
of
the
parties
did...
did
in
connection
with
that
review...
is
because
the
special
master
required
it.
there
is
no
other
reason
that
we
did
it.
we
did
not
volunteer
to
do
it
that
way.
we
did
not
like
doing
it
that
way.
the
master
said
that's
the
way
it's
going
to
be
in
my
recommendation.
how
much
would
that
amount
to?
we
did
not
agree
in
any
way
to
that
part
of
the
calculation.
i
would
also
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
amounts
involved,
that
you
need
to
be
careful.
the
amounts
cited
by
mr.
robbins
are
not
from
the
same
year.
mr.
john
b.
draper
thank
you,
your
honor.
