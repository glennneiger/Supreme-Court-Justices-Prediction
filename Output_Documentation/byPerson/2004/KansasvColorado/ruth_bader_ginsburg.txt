justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
method...
your
method
will
over-emphasize
the
dry
years.
so
either
way
you
have
a...
a
imperfect
situation.
in
your
case,
year
by
year,
and
in
a
dry
year,
colorado
perhaps
must
over-compensate,
and
if
you
have,
say,
3
dry
years
in
a
row,
then
it's
going
to
be...
work
out
to
colorado's
disadvantage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
method
that
you're
attacking,
but
if
you
were
to
do
it
year
by
year,
wouldn't
it
be
just
the
reverse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
aren't
you
bypassing
what
congress
set
up?
you
have
this
interstate
compact
and
this
commission,
which
you're
saying,
well,
it's
ineffective
because
it
has
to...
there
are
three
from
each
state
and
it
has
to
do
everything
unanimously.
but
what
about
the
commission's
authority
to
call
in
an...
an
arbitrator
when
they
are
deadlocked?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
congress--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
special
master
would
be
out.
the
special
master
would
be
out
of
the
picture,
as
you
describe
it.
you...
the
special
master
would
be
finished.
the
river
master
would
take
over.
has
there
ever
been...
has
this
court
ever
appointed
a
river
master
when
the
special
master
did
not
recommend
it?
and
as
i
understand
both
delaware
and
the
pecos
river
case,
the
special
master
recommended
the
appointment
of
a
river
master.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did
the
special--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
did
the
special
master
mean
when
he
said
he
recognized
the
unanimous
vote
problem,
but
he
said,
but
the
climate
may
be
changing?
the
compact
administration
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
united
states
representative
may
again
be
seen
as
the
best
way
to
administer
their
compact
and
settle
issues.
what
was
he
talking
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
was
nothing
tangible
behind
his--
