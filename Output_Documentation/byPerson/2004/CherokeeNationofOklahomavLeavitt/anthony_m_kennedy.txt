m.

i
don't
want
to
get
ahead
of
you
in
taking
us
through
the
statute,
so
you
can
defer
the
question
if...
if
you
choose.
but
it
seems
to
me
relevant
to
(a).
does...
is...
is
part
of
the
submission
that
the
government
used
some
of
the
funds
that
otherwise
would
have
gone
to
you
for
its
own
monitoring
and...
of...
of
health
contracts
and
that
that's
what's
in
dispute?
or
was
it
just
general
overhead
for
other
programs
it
used?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
stated
an
or.
i...
what
i...
i
stated
at
the
outset?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
including
contract
monitoring.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
further
to
justice
scalia's
point,
don't
the
contracts
in
question
themselves
contain
clauses
that
say
this
is
not
a
procurement
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
the
act
says
that
they're
not
procurement
contracts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
didn't
the
tribes
get
notice
they
might
not
get
the
full
amount
of
the...
the
csc,
and
so
they
had
ample
opportunity
to
cut
back
on
their
spending?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
these...
these
are
reliance
damages
in
a
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
they...
they
were
out
of
pocket
for
money
they
spent
before
they
knew,
other
than
the
statutory
notice
they
had,
that
they
wouldn't
get
the
full
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
did
say
the...
these
contracts
were
unique.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
government
says
it's
unique
because
the
tribes
are
providing
governmental
services.
it
doesn't
really
cite
us
a
case
where,
say,
a
city
or
a
subdivision
has
sued
under
a
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
i
thought
the
submission
of
the
petitioners'
counsel
was
that
some
of
these
funds
were
used
to
monitor
the
contracts
which
are
functions
the
tribes
could
have
performed.
so
is
there
a
factual
disagreement
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
not
saying...
you're
addressing
not
what
was
contracted
out,
but
what
funds
are
available.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
where
your
argument
is
going.
