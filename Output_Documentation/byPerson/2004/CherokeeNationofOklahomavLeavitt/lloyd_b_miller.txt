mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
two
contract
cases
concern
whether
the
government
is
liable
in
money
damages
under
the
contract
disputes
act
and
section
110
of
the
indian
self-determination
act
when
the
secretary
fails
to
fully
pay
a
contract
price
for
the--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--no,
justice
o'connor.
they're...
they're
not
overlapping.
the
claims
in
the
federal
circuit
case
involved
three
contracts
covering
fiscal
years
1994,
1995,
and
1996.
and
the
cherokee
contract
at
issue
in
the
case
that
went
through
the
tenth
circuit
is
fiscal
year
1997
contract
and
funding
agreement.
the
section...
remedial
section
of
the
act,
section
110--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
the
federal
circuit
applied
standard,
bedrock
government
contracting
law,
primarily
the
rule
that
when
a
contract
payment
is
conditioned
on
there
being
an
appropriation,
the
payment
right
vests
in
full
once
the
appropriation
is
enacted
by
congress.
and
secondly,
the
court
ruled
that
the
indian
self-determination
act
does
not
bar
the
payment
of
the
contracts
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
presented.
and
to
the
contrary.
we
submit
that
the
secretary's
construction
of
that
clause
would
undo
the
act,
would
undo
section
106(b)
of
the
act--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--no,
justice
o'connor.
there...
there
is
no
difference
in
that
respect,
and
there
is
an
overlap
in...
in
this
sense.
the
shoshone-paiute
contract
that
arose
through
the
tenth
circuit
case
did
involve
fiscal
year
1996,
the
same
fiscal
year
as
the
cherokee
contract
that
covered
fiscal
year
1996.
so
in
that
sense,
both
cases
involved
the...
the
same
relevant
issues.
the...
the
key,
we
think,
to
the
resolution
of
the
act
is
found
in
the
act
on
page
12a
of
the
appendix
to
our
opening
blue
brief.
the
act
was
amended
in
this
section
twice,
in
1988
and
in
1994,
for
three
reasons:
to
secure
contract
funding,
to
reduce
the
federal
bureaucracy,
and
to
eliminate
secretarial
funding
discretion
over
contract
funding
issues.
in
section
12a,
450j-1(a),
the
bottom
half
of
the
page,
it
is
stated
in
subparagraph
(1)
that
the
amount
of
funds
provided
under
the
terms
of
self-determination
contracts
entered
into
pursuant
to
this
subchapter
shall
not
be
less
than
the
appropriate
secretary
would
have
otherwise
provided.
and
then
directly
pertinent
to
this
case
is
subparagraph
(2),
which
directs...
which
addresses
contract
support
costs.
there
shall
be
added
to
the
amount
required
by
paragraph
(1)
contract
support
costs
which
shall
consist
of
certain
items.
incidentally,
these
items
typically
cover
the
cost
of
insurance,
audit
costs,
procurement
costs
that
might
otherwise
be
administered
for
the
government
by
the
office
of
personnel
management
or
personnel
costs
that
might
otherwise
be
administered
by
the
office
of
personnel
management.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
yes,
they
do.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
in
the
case
of
the
shoshone-paiute
contract,
when
the
parties
decided
to
renegotiate
the
contract
amount,
they
entered
into
an
amendment
to
specify
the
new,
updated
contract
amount.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
it...
it
is
precisely,
justice
kennedy,
what...
what
you
stated.
in
fact,
we
can
turn
directly
to
page
14a--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--the...
the
government
took
money
for
its
own
federal
functions
instead
of...
including
contract
monitoring--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--including
contract
monitoring.
including
contract
monitoring.
in
fact,
they
say
so
in
their
brief
and...
and
defend
that
action.
the...
the
sections
on
page
12a
and
13a
articulate
in
quite
a
lot
of
detail
the
nature
of
the
contract
support
costs
that
must
be
added.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
because--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--it...
it
is
a
unique
contractual
situation,
justice
scalia,
but
one
that
congress
fully
anticipated.
and...
and
i
would
explain
it
this
way.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
contract
disputes
act
which
congress
said
applies
to
these
contracts.
the
contracts
were
so
unique
that
prior
to
1988,
the
interior
board
of
contract
appeals,
in
a
decision
called
the
busby
case,
had
ruled
that
these
contracts
could
not
be
enforced
under
the
contract
disputes
act
precisely
for
the
reason
justice
scalia
articulated.
congress
changed
that.
in
1988,
congress
amended
section
110
of
the
act,
reproduced
at
the
bottom
of
page
26a,
and
gave
the
court
of
claims,
then
the
court
of
claims,
and
the
district
courts
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
money
damages
claims
under
the
contract
disputes
act.
and
the
legislative
history
explains
that
congress
did
this
precisely
to
overcome
the
busby
decision
and
to
make
these
contracts
enforceable
for
the
stated
contract
price.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
the...
the
procurement
contract...
that
is
correct.
not
the
contracts
themselves,
your
honor.
the...
the
act
says
that--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--the
contracts
are
not
procurement
contracts,
justice
kennedy.
that's
correct.
these
contracts
began
as
procurement
contracts.
they
had
been
procurement
contracts,
and
even
still,
they
were
not
enforced
under
the
court
of...
the
interior
board
of
contract
appeals
decision
in
the
busby
decision.
congress
relieved
the
contractors
of
the
procurement
system
because
they
felt
that
the
agency
had
built
up
an
enormous
contract
monitoring
bureaucracy
which
it
wanted
to
eliminate.
and
for
that
reason,
it
eliminated
the
procurement
rules
in
the
hopes
that
the
contract
monitoring
bureaucracy
would
be
eliminated
along
with
it.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
would
put
my
answer
in
this
context.
there
are
many
sources
from
which
the
government
could
have
reprogrammed
to
pay
these
contracts.
it
could
have
been,
yes,
as
we
submit,
from
the
funds
spent
on
federal
functions
and
secretarial
administration.
it
could
have
been
from
the
up
to
$88
million
increases
congress
was
making
every
year.
it
could
have
been
from
the
up
to
$98
million
in
leftover
appropriations
the
agencies
had
every
year,
and
it
could
have
been
from
the
regional
and
headquarters
offices
that
the
agencies
had
where
they
don't
administer
services.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
that's
the
duty
congress
imposed
upon
the
secretary.
the
secretary
was
free
not
to
reprogram.
that's...
that's
a
choice
the
secretary
had
and
the
secretary
made
it.
the
question
is
what
are
the
ramifications
of
that
choice
and
we
submit--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
your
honor,
we...
we
do
not
believe
that
that...
that
should
be
the
outcome.
that
would
advantage
the
contractors
that
came
forward
and
not
take
account
of
the
entire
situation.
we
think
the
global
situation
has
to
be
looked
at.
the
total
amount
of
the
contracts
that
were
not
paid
in
fiscal
year
1994--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--if
there
were
only
sufficient
money
to
pay
half
of
the
contract
shortfalls--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--without
violating
the
clause
and
the
secretary
had
the
discretion
not
to
reduce
appropriations,
or
he
could,
for
programs
serving
other
tribes,
and
then
the
tribes
would
only
be
entitled
to
half
of
the
shortfall,
if
there
was
only
a
sufficient
amount
of
money.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
no,
justice
kennedy,
and...
and
to
the
contrary.
in
fiscal
year
1994,
the
indian
health
service
was
telling
everybody
they
were
paying
them
in
full.
they
told
the
general
accounting
office
they
paid
everybody
in
full
on
page
32
of
the
gao
report
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
but--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--the...
the
tribes
expected
to
be
paid.
the
shoshone-paiute
tribes
were
told
they
would
be
paid
in
full
in
the
first
year.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
that
is
correct.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
the
contractors
don't
know
until
the
year
is
over
because
throughout
the
year,
the
government
reserves
the
power,
although
not
exercised,
but
stated
in
a
circular,
to
reprogram.
and
the
appropriations--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--when
the
secretary
prepares
a
budget
to
the
congress,
it
states
usually
a
lump
sum
amount
of,
say,
$1.8
billion.
we...
we
take
$400
million
off
the
top
or
$300
million
off
the
top
because
that
was
specified
by
congress
for
certain
purposes.
but
the
balance
is
a
lump
sum.
the
secretary
crafts
a
budget.
the
budget
is
not
adopted
by
congress,
just
a
dollar
amount
is
adopted
by
congress.
now,
congress
can
step
in
and
take
a
particular
item
and
earmark
that
item
and
cap
it
if
it
chooses,
but
it
didn't
do
that
in
these
years.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
the
tribes
enter
into
contracts,
as
most
government
contractors
do
when
they
enter
into
contracts
before
an
appropriation
is
made,
not
knowing
if
the
agency
will
have
the
money
to
pay
them.
that's
okay.
the
problem
is
when
the
statute
says
it's
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations
and
congress
enacts
the
appropriations.
it's
been
the
law
for
120
years
that
at
that
point,
the
right
to
payment
vests
and
the
tribe
is
entitled
to
be
paid.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
the
federal
government--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--yes.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
the
agency
then,
under
this
court's
teaching
in
lincoln
v.
vigil,
has
complete
discretion
over
how
it
spends
its
appropriation
except
insofar
as--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--yes,
thank
you,
justice
souter,
for
taking
me
back
to
your
question.
what
we
mean
is
that
the
secretary
submits
a
budget,
but
the
budget
is
not
binding
on
the
secretary.
it's
not
binding
as
a
matter
of
law
because
congress
didn't
adopt
it.
and
as
conditions
change
over
the
course
of
the
year,
the
agency
readjusts
its
budget,
which
we
call
reprogramming.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
correct.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
and
the
secretary
retains
complete
discretion
as
this
court
taught--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--well,
it
should
not
be
done
without
regard
to
the
contract
amounts--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--that
is
in
fact
how
it
was
done.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
well,
the
times
have
changed.
since
1998,
fiscal
year
1998,
congress
has
imposed
caps
on
the
contracts
and
court
costs
that
the
agency
has.
so
there's
no
question
the
agency
cannot
pay
more
than
congress
gives
it.
when
congress
only
gives
it
$100
million
or
$200
million
for
contract
support
costs,
that's
it.
the
secretary
cannot
be
sued
for
failing
to
pay
more.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
justice
scalia,
we
read
this...
this
clause
with...
keeping
in
mind
the
first
sentence
first
of
the
sentence.
the
first
sentence,
which
begins
on
the
preceding
page,
page
14a,
says
that
the
amount
of
funds
required
by
subsection
(a),
(1)
shall
not
be
reduced
to
make
funding
available
for
contract
monitoring
or
administration
by
the
secretary.
and
the
subparagraph
(3)
in
the
middle
of
page
15a,
shall
not
be
reduced
by
the
secretary
to
pay
for
federal
functions.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
but
then
there's
an
exception.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
we--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--justice
scalia,
for...
for
two
reasons
we
think
it
cannot.
first
of
all,
if
that
exception
swallowed
up
the
rule
set
forth
in
the
first
sentence,
it
would
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act.
and
more,
in
the
statute
on
page
21,
there
is
a
mandatory
rule
of
construction
that
congress
has
articulated
which,
interestingly
enough,
the
government
never
cites
in
the
statutory
interpretation
case.
and
this
rule
says
on
page
21,
1(a)(2),
each
provision
of
the
act--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--page...
sorry--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--21a
of
our
opening
blue
brief.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
21a,
correct.
each
provision
of
the
indian
self-determination
and
education
assistance
act
and
each
provision
of
this
contract
shall
be
liberally
construed
for
the
benefit
of
the
contractor.
that
statement
is
repeated
as
well
in
every--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--so
what
could
it
mean?
that's
our
challenge.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
we
have
to
give
it
meaning.
we
believe
it
means
the...
as
the
secretary
always
said
when...
and...
and
said
at
the
time
these
amendments
were
adopted
in
1988,
that's
services
on
the
ground,
the
hospitals
and
clinics.
if
i
walked
into
the
office
of
the
headquarters
of
the
indian
health
service
in
rockville,
maryland,
i'm
not
going
to
see
doctors
and
nurses
in
white
jackets.
i'm
not
going
to
see
patients
and
counselors.
there
aren't
programs
serving
tribes
in
these
headquarters
offices,
and
in
these
area
offices,
large
portions
of
what
they
do
are
administrative
functions.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
well,
we
still
need
to
provide
some
meaning
to
the...
to
the
provision
that
says
the
secretary
may
not...
does
not
have
to
reduce
funding
for
programs
serving
other
tribes.
i
guess,
i
think
we
do
need
to
grapple
with
the
clause
in
order
not
to--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--it's
going
to
be
the
bureaucracy.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
it's
not
going
to
be
the
programs
on
the
ground
serving
the
tribes.
it's
going
to
be
the
bureaucracy.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
now,
it
may
be
felt--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--well,
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--i
say
that
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the...
the
congress,
in
our
opinion,
clearly
privileged
the
tribal
contracts
over
the
secretary's
federal
functions.
but
more
practically,
let's
look
at
the
shoshone-paiute
tribes.
they
took
over
a
hospital
that
had
a
$5
million
budget
in
round
numbers,
and
the
contract
support
costs
requirement
was
$2
million.
so
the
contract
was
in
round
numbers
$7
million.
so
they
get
the
hospital,
$5
million
to
run
it.
they
don't
get
the
$2
million.
now,
they
have
$3
million
to
run
the
hospital.
it's
not
that
they
didn't
get
their
bureaucracy.
they
didn't
get
the
full
hospital
operational
budget
because
they
had
to
pay
the
fixed
costs
of
carrying
insurance,
undertaking
the
audits
required
by
federal
law.
there
were
actual
reductions
in
services
so
severe,
in
fact,
that
the
shoshone-paiute
tribe
nearly
lost
accreditation.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
the
equivalent
of
the
$10
million
would
be
sums
not
spent
on
anything--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--in
this
case,
up
to
$100
million.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
any
of
the
increases,
any
of
the
sums.
and
then
we
move
to
this
statute--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--why
the
purpose.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
well,
that's
one
of
the
things
the...
the
government
and
we
agree
upon.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
one
of
the
purposes
was
paying
contracts,
and
that's
because
in
this
act,
the
appropriation
says
here's
$1.4
billion
or
$1.8
billion
to
carry
out
the
indian
self-determination
act.
so
that
satisfies
the
purpose
test.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
the
government--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--in...
in
the
hypothetical.
no.
i
think
the
government
would
agree
that
the
rule
of
ferris
and
blackhawk,
the
dougherty
rule
from
the
court
of
claims,
1983,
all
stand
for
the
proposition
when
you
sign
a
contract
with
the
government
and
a
lump
sum
appropriation
comes,
it's
not
your
job
to
start
monitoring
government
operations
and
figuring
out
how
much
do
they
want
to
boost
their
functions
for
this
or
that
or
the
other,
and
the--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--that
is
correct.
they
claim
these
aren't
contracts...
justice
kennedy.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
these
contracts
are
unique.
the
contracts
in
winstar
were
unique.
the
contracts
in
the
united
states
v.
new
mexico
advance
costs...
advance
funded
cost
reimbursable
contracts.
many
contracts
are
unique.
the
question
is
whether
the
distinction
makes
a
difference
in
the
law.
the
distinction
here
that
these
are
not
procurement
contracts,
that
can't
be
decisive.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
but
that's
not
unique
either
because
the...
the
government,
the
department
of
defense
in
iraq
contracts
out
governmental
services,
the
provision
of
food
to
our
troops
in
iraq.
that's
a
quintessential
governmental
services,
feeding
the
military.
but
they
contract
it
out.
no
one
would
suggest
there
that
just
because
it's
a
governmental
service,
it
qualifies
that
contract
as
a
lesser
contract
than
any
other
contract.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
absolutely.
and
even
congress
considered--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--we--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--we--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--we
submit
that
that
difference
was
considered
by
congress.
in
the
1988
amendments,
there's
even
language
that
says,
we're
thinking
about
maybe
calling
this
an
intergovernmental
agreement,
but
we've
decided
to
call
it
a
contract
because
we
want
it
to
be
enforceable
as
a
contract,
just
as
other
government
contracts
for
goods
and
services
are
enforced.
and
that
was
the
language
of
the...
of
the
senate
report.
they
then
imposed
the
contract
disputes
act
and
provided
a
remedy
in
money
damages.
in
those
respects,
along
with
the
canon
of
construction,
we
believe
that
these
contracts
are
fully
enforceable
for
the
stated
contract
amount.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
justice
stevens.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
justice
stevens,
thank
you.
first,
i'd
like
to
address
the
availability
of
appropriations
clause
briefly.
that
is
a
term
of
art
with
a
well-established
meaning.
this
court
in
morissette
said
that
if...
unless
there's
a
contrary
direction
from
congress
that
the
term
of
art
should
not
be
given
its
well-established
meaning,
it
controls.
and
that
is
the
meaning,
purpose,
time,
and
amount,
that
the
appropriation
is
available
for
the
purpose
during
the
time
and
in
the
amounts
necessary
to
fully--
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
--secondly,
with
regard
to
the
core
governmental
functions,
in
blackhawk,
the
contractor
had
a
settlement
with
the
veterans
administration.
the
veterans
administration
had
to
reprogram.
from
where?
we
don't
know,
but
the
veterans
administration
had
to
reprogram
and
wanted
to
get
approval
from
the
congress
for
that
reprogramming
action.
congress
then
stepped
in
but
after
the
payment
was
due
and
forbade
any
reprogramming,
and
the
court
then
held
when
the
payment
was
due,
money
was
legally
available
and
it
doesn't
matter
where
it
comes
from.
there
is
no
protection
for
inherent
federal
functions.
it
may
have
come
from
some
other
hospital
budget.
it
may
have
come
from
some
other
activity
of
the
veterans
administration.
no
doubt
everything
the
va
does
is
important,
but
it
doesn't
mean
it
didn't
have
a
legal
obligation
to
pay
the
contract.
there
is
no
rule
that
has
an
iff
exception
to
the
governmental
duty
to
pay,
and
if
there
was,
it
would
upset
government
contract
law
deeply
as
the
amicus
brief
from
the
national
chamber
explains.
secondly,
when
funds
are
not
available,
we
know
what
happens.
this
court's
decision,
justice
brandeis'
decision
for
the
court,
in
sutton
explains
what
happens
when
funds
are
not
available.
there
was
a
line
item
appropriation
of
$20,000
for
a
construction
project.
we
understand
that
the
contractor
was
on
notice.
everything
is
square.
here,
the
entire
lump
sum
appropriation
was
available,
and
i'd
like
to
give
the
court
a
sense
of
where
the
money
could
have
come
from,
not
that
the
government
had
to
do
it.
just
as
in
blackhawk,
if
they
chose
not
to
reprogram,
that's
their
right.
but
then
there's
a
remedy.
where
could
the
money
have
come
from?
in
1994,
there
was
slightly
under
$2
million
in
a
shortfall,
just
to
the
cherokee
contractor.
no
other
contractor
was
apparently
shorted.
there
was
up
to
$98
million
in
leftover
appropriations
that
year.
there
was
55...
$88
million
in
an
increase,
up
to
$88
million
in
increase
every
year
from
$36
million
to
$88
million.
there
was
$25
million
in
inherent
federal
functions.
they
couldn't
have
shaved
that
by
10
percent
to
pay
this
contractor?
not
that
they
had
to.
they
could
have
taken
some
of
it
from
there,
some
of
it
from
the
leftover,
some
of
it
from
the
increase,
some
of
it
from
the
offices
at
headquarters
and
area
offices.
that
was
their
decision.
but
the
contractor
didn't
take
the
risk
that
the
secretary
would
say,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
i've
decided
to
allocate
100
percent
of
my
money
this
way,
and
by
golly,
there's
nothing
left
for
you.
no
contractor
takes
that
risk
in
dealing
with
the
government,
and
surely,
a
tribal
contractor
with
a
mandatory
contract
set
forth
in
the
statute
doesn't
take
that
risk
either.
there
is
no
limitation
to
the
secretary's
theory
in
this
case.
the
secretary's
theory
means
that
we
come,
the
contractors
come,
after
the
allocation
of
the
secretary.
well,
the
secretary
could,
in
a
reduction
year,
decide
to
allocate
the
entire
reduction
to
the
contracts
and
enhance
even
his
own
federal
bureaucracy
and
programs
serving
other
tribes
and
say,
now
i've
made
my
decision
and
i've
made
my
judgment.
i
don't
have
enough
money
to
pay
you.
there's
no
limit
here
on
contract
support
costs.
it
could
be
the
secretarial
amount.
they
could
zero
out
these
contracts
and
say
it's
practical
availability.
and
we've
decided
there
isn't
enough
money
to
deal
with
all
of
the
health
care
needs
in
the
country,
so
we're
going
to
deal
with
the
ones
we
operate
and
you
come
last.
now,
that's
not
what
the...
that's
not
what
the
statute
permits.
that
sort
of
interpretation
would
lead
to
an
absurdity.
with
regard
to
the
tenth
circuit
decision,
justice,
you
asked
a
question
about
the
declarations
in
the
tenth
circuit.
there
was
a
declaration
in
the
tenth
circuit,
but
all
it
had
was
a
conclusory
statement,
to
have
reprogrammed
anything
would
have
caused
reductions
in
programs
serving
other
tribes.
now,
that
is
not
sufficient
proof
to
withstand
summary
judgment,
and
it's
certainly
not
sufficient
proof
to
establish
summary
judgment.
so
for
all
these
reasons,
we
believe
the
tenth
circuit
decision
should
be
reversed
and
the
federal
circuit
decision
affirmed.
unless
the
court
has
more
questions.
mr.
lloyd
b.
miller
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
