mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
apart
from
the
roughly
2
percent
of
the
annual
lump
sum
appropriation
that
the
secretary
withheld
for
performance
of
those
core
agency
functions
that
the
agency
itself
was
required
to
perform,
the
secretary
allocated
the
entire
remaining
98
percent
of
its
lump
sum
appropriation
among
tribes.
now,
the
tribes
have
to
point
to
some
source
of
funding
within
that
lump
sum
appropriation.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
with
respect
to
the
2
percent
that's
reserved
for
inherent
federal
functions,
that's
not
available.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
with
respect
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
justice
breyer,
i'm
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
2
percent
that's
reserved
for
core
agency
functions
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it's
been
a
background
principle
of
government
contracting
law
that
there
are
certain
core
agency
functions
that...
that
the
government
is
required
to
perform
for
itself
and
that
it
can't
contract
out.
so
i
think
that
informs
the
interpretation
of
the
subject
to
availability
clause.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
context.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
would
be
no
if
this
statutory
regime
governed,
justice
breyer.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
if...
if
all--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--if...
if
all
that's
at
issue
is
a
standard
subject
to
availability
clause
in
a
contract
and
there
were
no
reduction
clause,
as
there
is
in
this
statute,
and
you're
dealing
with
the
standard
procurement
context,
then
there
is
a
court
of
claims
decision,
the
blackhawk
decision,
that
suggests,
albeit
in
a
footnote,
that
in
that
situation,
there
are
funds
available
in
the
sense
that
they're
legally
unrestricted.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
aren't
any
funds
that
are
available
here
in
our
view
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--under
blackhawk,
it
would
be...
it
would...
it
would
essentially
affect
the
entire
lump
sum
appropriation
because
there's
no
legal
requirement
that
the
lump
sum
appropriation
be...
be
directed
in
any
particular
manner.
now,
there
are
some
provisions
in
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that...
that
would
include
in
the...
that
would
include
the
2
percent.
but
there
are
provisions,
i
should
note
parenthetically,
in
the
appropriations
act
that
say
specifically,
for
example,
that
not
to
exceed
a
certain
amount
is
to
be
used
for
a
particular
function
or
at
least
a
certain
amount
is
to
be
used,
for
example,
for
contract
health
services.
so
you'd
have
to
take
into
account--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--those
particular
provisos.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
first
and
foremost,
the
text
of
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
page
15a
of
the
appendix
to...
to
the
tribes'
briefs,
this
isn't
your
standard,
garden
variety
subject
to
availability
clause.
you
have
to
look
at
the
particular
context
in
which
this
statute--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it's
not,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect.
it
says,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision...
and
i'm
reading
at
the
bottom
of
page
15a...
the
provision
of
funds
under
this
subchapter
is
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations
and...
and
this
is--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that
particular
phrase
resembles
the
one
that
justice
breyer
posited
in
his
hypothetical.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
but
the
term
available...
and
i
think
this
is
critical.
the
term
available
is
repeated
in
what's
been
referred
to
as
the
reduction
clause,
and
i
don't
think
one
can
understand
what
the
term
available
means
unless
it
considers
the
meaning
of
that
term
throughout
that
entire
sentence.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i...
i
think
that
argument
is
incorrect.
first
of
all,
it's
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
the
reduction
clause.
but
second
of
all,
the
notion
that
funds
for
inherent
federal
functions,
the
2
percent
that
the
agency
reserved
to
perform
its
core
agency
functions,
were
available
for
contracting
is
contrary
to...
to
the
terms
of
the
isda
itself.
and
if
you'll
look
at
page
12a...
and
i'm
quoting
from
450j-1(a)(1)...
what
provision
says
is
the
amount
of
funds
provided
under
the
terms
of
self-determination
contracts
include
the
amount
that
the
secretary,
quote,
would
have
otherwise
provided.
and
then
later
on
down
in
the
paragraph--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry.
it's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--shall
not...
shall
be
not
less
than
the
amount
that
the
appropriate
secretary
would
have
otherwise
provided.
and
then
further
down
in
the
paragraph
in
the
last...
in
the
last
clause,
including
support
of
administrative
functions
that
are
otherwise
contractable.
and
what
otherwise
contractable
denotes
is
that
there
are
certain
functions
that
are
not
otherwise
contractable,
namely
those
core,
inherent
federal
functions
that
the
agency
itself
is
required
to
provide.
and
so
what
450j-1(a)
implements
is
the
background
understanding
that
funds
for
core
agency
functions
don't
have
to
be
turned
over
to
the
contracting
tribes
because
the
agency
requires
those
funds
in
order
to
continue
essentially
to
exist
as
a
federal
agency.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
it's
more
of
a
characterization
disagreement.
there...
it's
true
that
in
a
descriptive
sense,
one
might
refer
to
some
of
these
funds
as
used
for
contract
monitoring,
but
what
450j-1(a)
says
is
that
whatever
you
might
call
it,
the
funds
that
are
used
for
core
agency
functions
are
outside
the
funds
to
be...
to
be
turned
over.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it's
talking
about
both
because
the...
the
first
part
of
subparagraph
(1)
is
the
amount
of
funds.
it's
relating
to
the
amount
of
funds
that
are
required
to
be
transferred,
and
what
it
stands
for
is
that
funds
for
supportive
administrative
functions
that
are
not
otherwise
contractable,
i.e.,
those
core
agency
functions
that
the
agency
is
required
to
perform
itself,
those
funds
aren't
required
to
be
turned
over
to
contracting
tribes.
and
that
just
reflects
the
common
sense
principle
that
the
agency
has
to
continue
to
exist
to
perform
some
core
functions.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
ginsburg,
the
way
we
square
that
under
the
statute
is
that
the
leading...
the
initial
sentence
in
subsection
(b)
says
the
amount
of
funds
required
by
subsection
(a)
of
this
section.
and
our
view
of
the
statute
is
that
funds
for
inherent
federal
functions
were
never
required
to
be
transferred
under
subsection
(a)
to
begin
with.
and
so
what
(b)
deals
with
is
the
funds
that
are
left
over
after
the
funds
for
inherent
federal
functions
are
taken
off
the
top.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
oh,
absolutely
there
are.
the
federal
functions
is
the
broader
set
of...
it
could
essentially
encompass
everything
the
federal
government
does.
inherent
federal
functions
refers
to
that
core
set
of
functions
that
the
agency
itself
is
required
to
perform.
and
the
distinction
between
inherent
federal
functions
and
federal
functions,
although
it
might
seem
trivial
as
a
semantic
matter,
is
reflected
in
fact
in
the
definitions
in
title
v
of
the
isda
where
it
specifically
defines
inherent
federal
functions
as
a
subset
of
federal
functions.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it...
it
does.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
does,
justice
scalia...
justice
souter.
excuse
me.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
we
describe
the...
the
relevant
provision
in
our
brief,
if
you'll
bear
with
me
for
just
one
second,
on
page
31.
when
congress
enacted
the
title
iv
self-governance
provisions
that
relate
to
the
bia...
and
this
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
partial
paragraph
that
begins
with
of
particular
significance.
there's
a
provision
there,
25
u.s.c.
458cc(k).
and
the
provision
reads
that
nothing
in
this
section
is
intended
or
shall
be
construed
to
expand
or
alter
existing
statutory
authorities
so
as
to
authorize
the
secretary
to
enter
into
any
agreement
with
respect
to
functions
that
are
inherently
federal.
and
i
think
what
that
signifies
is
that
there
are
some
functions
that
are
not
contractable
and
can't
be
turned
over
to
the
tribes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
breyer,
one
background
principle...
and
it's
reflected,
by
the
way,
in
the
terms
of
the
contracts
themselves.
one
background
principle
is
that
funds
for
inherent
federal
functions
are
not
required
to
be
transferred
to
tribes.
and
the
contracts--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
they
specifically--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--they
specifically
did
not
transfer--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no.
the...
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
what
i'm
responding
to
is
the
suggestion
that
funds
that
were
allocated
by
the
secretary
to
pay
for
inherent
federal
functions
were
required
to
be
diverted
to
pay
for
the
indirect
costs--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
correct.
it
relates
to
the
funds
that
are
available.
and
the
tribes'
position--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
not
funds--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
we
think
that
funds
for
inherent
federal
functions
were
taken
off...
off
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
there
is,
justice
stevens,
in
the
following
sense.
it's
not
at
all
the
case
that
the
secretary
had
unfettered
discretion
in
composing
the
allocation
scheme
in
any
fiscal
year.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
in...
in
part
it
was
mandated
by
the
statute.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
perhaps
not
in
whole--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
at
least
in
significant
part.
and
let
me...
but
i
think
this
is
significant,
and
if
i
can
just
walk
the
court
through
the
process
by
which
the
budget
is
developed
and
any
appropriation
ultimately
is
allocated.
the
secretary
has
always,
both
before
the
isda
and
after
the
isda,
taken
the
current
year's
allocation
across
programs
as
a
given,
as
a
baseline
from
which
the
next
year's
allocation
will
be
built.
and
that's
reflected
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
on
pages
14a
to
15a
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief.
there's
a
provision,
450j-1(b)(2),
that
says
that
the
amount
that's
transferred
to
contractors
shall
not
be
reduced
by
the
secretary
in
subsequent
years
except
pursuant
to
certain
limited
criteria
and
one
of
which,
the
principal
one
of
which,
is
the
reduction
in
appropriations.
but
we're
not
dealing
with
that
in
the
relevant
fiscal
years.
there
was
always
an
increase.
and
so
the
secretary,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
kept
the
funding
for
across
programs
at
least
at
the
level
that
it
was
at
the
previous
fiscal
year.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
the
secretary
builds
two...
two
considerations
on
top.
the
first
is
mandatory
across-the-board
increases
for
things
such
as
salary
cola's
and
inflationary
adjustments.
and
that's
a
standard
feature
of
budgeting,
and
it's
reflected
again
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
and
that...
i'd
point
the
court
to
page
9
of
the
government's
brief,
the
gray
brief,
where
we
cite
a
provision,
25
u.s.c.
1680a.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
was...
i...
i
think
in
principal
part
it
was
mandated
by
the...
by--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
let--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--at
least
as
far--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--insofar
as
what
i've
said
with
respect--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sorry.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
justice
stevens.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
don't
think
that
they
have
discretion
to
do
that.
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
explain.
at
least
with
respect
to
the
existing
baseline
and
a
mandatory
across-the-board
increases,
it's
mandated
by
the
statute
that
the...
that
the
secretary
conduct
his
budgeting
allocation
process
in
the
way
that
he's
done.
with
respect
to
the
mandatory
across-the-board
increases,
on
page
9
of
the
government's
brief,
25
u.s.c.
1680a,
a
provision
that
relates
specifically
to
the
administration
of
the
self-determination
act,
it
requires
the
secretary
to
provide
funds
to
contracting
tribes
for,
quote,
cost-of-living
increases,
closed
quote,
and,
quote,
other
expenses
relating
to
the
provision
of
health
services,
closed
quote,
on
the,
quote,
same
basis
as
such
funds
are
provided
to
programs
and
services
operated
directly.
in
other
words,
with
respect
to
mandatory
across-the-board
increases,
the
secretary
has
to
allocate
those
proportionately
amongst
contracting
tribes
and
non-contracting
tribes.
and
that
leaves
the
additional
set
of
an
increase
from
one
year
to
the
next
year
that
deals
with
specific
targeted
items,
and
principally
that
would
include,
for
example,
staffing
of
new
facilities
that
come
on
board
during
the
course
of
a
particular
fiscal
year.
and
with
respect
to
those
specific
targeted
items,
the
critical
point
is
that
the
contracting
tribes
often
benefit
from
the
addition
of
those
and
from
the
enforcement
by
the
secretary
of
those
sorts
of
earmarks.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
the...
one
of
the
facilities
that's
at
issue
is
the
stillwell
clinic
in
oklahoma.
that
was
a
new
facility
that
came
on
board
in
the
early
1990s
and
for
which
the...
for
which
the
cherokee
nation
assumed
administration
of
it
through
a
self-determination
agreement.
now,
the
staffing
for
that
facility
was
specifically
earmarked
in
the
secretary's
budget
submissions
and
in...
in
congress'
appropriation
committee
reports.
and
it,
of
course,
is
in
the
cherokee
nation's
interest
to
ensure
that
those
earmarks
are
honored.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they're
not
binding
law,
justice
stevens.
we
fully
recognize
that.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
don't
think
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
require
the
secretary
to
completely
ignore
the
committee
reports.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it's
not
just
the
committee
reports,
justice
souter.
it's
the
reduction
clause.
the
reduction
clause
is
a
part
of
the
statute
and
no
one
has
ever
suggested
the
reduction
clause
doesn't
inform
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
contract.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that
is
what
they're
saying,
justice
souter,
but
with
respect
to,
i
think
it's
incorrect.
the
government
bureaucracy
consists
of
two
separate
types
of
bureaucracy.
there's
that
core
bureaucracy
that
is
the
inherent
federal
functions.
and
one
of
their
arguments
is
that
the
secretary
was
required
to
divest
himself
of
the
funds
that
were
necessary
to
perform
those
functions.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because,
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
core
of
it
is
that
even
if
you
think
that
they're
right,
that
these
funds
are
legally
available,
that's
not
enough
under
the
isda
because
the
isda
specifically
reserves
to
the
secretary
the
discretion
that
he
not
be
required
to
reduce
funding
for
programs,
projects,
or
activities
serving
a
tribe
in
order
to
make
funds
available
to
another
tribe
under
this
subchapter.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
they
thought...
the...
the
board...
the
federal
circuit
at
least,
which
echoed
the
board
of
contract
appeals,
thought--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
don't
think
the
board
of...
of
contract
appeals
really
wrestled
directly
with
where
the
funds
were
coming
from.
they
just
thought
that
legal
availability
would
be
sufficient.
now,
what
the
federal
circuit
said
was
that
funds
for
inherent
federal
functions
are
available.
and
we
think
that's
wrong
for
the
reasons
i've
said.
i
don't
think
those
funds
ever
came
into
the
group
of
funds
that
were
subject
to
be
transferred
to
begin
with.
but
even
if
you
thought
that
they
did,
i
think
it's
clear
that
funds
for
inherent
federal
functions
are
funds
for
programs,
projects,
or
activities
serving
a
tribe
in
the
sense
that
one
example
of
a
core
federal
function--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
let's...
justice
souter,
if
i...
if
i
could,
let's
look
at
the
particular
sources--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i...
i
guess
the
way
i'd
like
to
make
the
point
is
to
say
that
the
sources
of
funds
that
they
point
to,
which
include
inherent
federal
functions
and
the...
the
noninherent
federal
function
bureaucracy
that
supports
the
administration
of
programs
that
serve
tribes
that
are
directly
served
by
the
federal
government,
those
two
are
in
fact
programs,
projects,
or
activities
serving
a
tribe.
with
respect
to
the
administrative
support--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
one
straightforward
reason
why
you
don't
have
to
take
that
assumption
is
that
it's
not
only
the
federal
circuit
case
that's
before
the
court,
it's
also
the
tenth
circuit
case.
and
there's...
there
are
declarations
in
the
tenth
circuit
case
that
specifically
assert
that
diverting
funding
for...
to
pay
for
the
contract
support
costs
of
these
tribes
would
have
required
reducing
funds
for
programs,
projects,
or
activities
serving
a
tribe.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
so--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--we're
talking
about
both
existing
programs
and
new
programs,
and
with
respect
to
new
programs,
there's...
it's
every
bit
as
likely
that
those
new
programs
would
benefit
contracting
tribes
as
noncontracting
tribes.
and
again,
one
of
the
new
facilities--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
don't
think
that
reduce
necessarily
takes
the
existing
year's
appropriation
as
the
baseline.
we
think
that
what
it
takes
as
the
baseline
is
the
current
year's
appropriation
allocation
which
takes
into
account
increases.
and
one
way
to
see
that
is
25
u.s.c.
1680a,
which
is
the
provision
that
i
cited
earlier
that
requires
the
secretary
to
apportion
mandatory
across-the-board
increases
on
a
proportionate
basis
as
between
contracted
programs
and
noncontracted
programs.
and
what
that
provision
means
is
that
the
reduction
takes
into
account
those
mandatory
across-the-board
increases
from
year
to
year.
so
in
some
sense,
i
think
reduce
does
mean
this
year's
allocation
of
appropriations
as
opposed
to
last
year's
spending
amount.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
they...
they
make
the
point
as
a
general
matter,
and
they
also
give
an
example.
i
think
the
one
example
that
they
give...
and
maybe
there
are
more...
is...
is
a
diabetes
program.
but
i
think
it's
more
the
general
principle--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
an...
the...
the
particular
example
is
an
existing
program.
but
i
think
it's
more--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--you're...
you're
speaking
with
particular
respect
to
the
new
programs,
justice
stevens?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
don't
think
that
even
with
respect
to
the
current
year
there
wouldn't
be
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
complete
shortfall
in
contract
support
costs.
if
you
look
at
the
figures,
the
shortfall
in
contract
support
costs,
for
example,
in
1997
cumulatively
was
$82
million,
and
that's...
that
is
more
than
the
amount
of
the
appropriation
increase
from
fy
1996
to
fy
1997.
it's
more
than
the
amount
that
was
reserved
by
the
government
for
inherent
federal
functions.
and
so
even
if
you
accepted
that
interpretation,
it
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
fully
fund
the
contract
support
costs.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
o'connor,
congress
changed
things
by
imposing
a
statutory
cap,
explicit
statutory
cap,
on
contract
support
cost
funding
beginning
with
1998.
it
had
done
so
since
1994
for
the
bia
and
it
did
so
beginning
in
1998
with
respect
to
ihs.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
the
difference
lies
in
the
extent
to
which
there
was
perceived
to
be
a
shortfall.
my
understanding
is
that
there
was
a
shortfall
already
in
bia
programs
whereas
the
shortfall
didn't
really
become
evident
with
respect
to
the
ihs
until
1994
and
beyond.
and
that's
why
you
might
see
the
discrepancy
between
the
two.
but
congress
also
acted,
by
the
way,
in
1998
in
the
1999
appropriations
act
in
enacting
section
314
of
the
1999
appropriations
act.
and
i
think,
if
nothing
else,
section
314
at
list...
at
least
expresses
the
view
of
a
subsequent
congress
that
the
secretary's
allocation
scheme
from
1994
to
1997
was
legitimate
and
was
fully
within
his
discretion
under
the
isda.
and
under
this
court's
decisions
in
red
lion
and
its
progeny,
that
determination
by
a
subsequent
congress
is
at
least
entitled
to
great
weight
in
determining
what
the
secretary
appropriately
exercised
discretion
in
1994
through
1997.
so
even
if
you
thought
that
there
was
some
doubt
on
whether
the
secretary
had
carried
out
his
functions
consistently
with
the
isda,
i
think
congress'
saying
later
in
the
1999
appropriation
act
that
its
view
was
that
secretary
had
done
so
legitimately
should
push
the
court
towards
ruling
in
our
favor
on
the
initial
interpretation
of
the
isda.
i
want
to
address
really
quickly,
if
i
could,
the
notion
that
the
funds
for
administrative
support
for
programs
that
are
administered
directly
by
the
federal
government
are
available.
and
that
would
have
significant
consequences
because
one
of
the
policies
underlying
the
act
is
not
only
to
protect
the
interests
of
tribes
that
are
currently
entered
into
self-determination
contracts,
but
it's
to
protect
the
amounts
that
are
available
to
tribes
that
might
some
day
choose
to
enter
into
self-determination
contracts.
and
if,
under
the
tribes'
view,
the
secretary
was
required
to
divert
the
entire
amount
of
the
increase
in
any
particular
year
to
contracting
tribes
or
to...
to
divert
the
entire
amount
of
administrative
support
for...
for
noncontracted
programs
to
contracting
tribes,
the
effect
of
that
would
be
to
freeze
in
place
the
amounts
that
were
available
for
potentially
contracting
tribes
in
future
years.
thank
you.
