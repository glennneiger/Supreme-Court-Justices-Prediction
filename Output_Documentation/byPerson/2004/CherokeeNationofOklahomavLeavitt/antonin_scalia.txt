these
are
strange
contracts,
of
course,
aren't
they?
i
mean,
are
there
any
other
contracts
that
the
government
has
to
enter
into?
i
mean,
the
secretary
has
to
give
these
tribes
the
authority
to
take
over,
in
effect,
implementation
of
the...
of
a
federal
health
program,
doesn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
why
would
you
expect
that
this
strange
kind
of
contract
should...
should,
prima
facie,
be
governed
by
the
same
rules
as
to
appropriations
as
other
contracts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where...
where
an
agency,
having
due
regard
to
how
much
money
is
appropriated,
will
limit
the
number
of
contracts
it
enters
into?
but...
but
here
you're
creating
a
situation
where
the
agency
has
to
contract
and
yet
has
no
control
over
having
enough
money
to...
to
meet
the
contractual
obligations.
it
seems
to
me
a...
a
strange
way
to
run
a
railroad.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can't
get
blood
out
of
a
turnip.
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg
is
asking
the
question,
what
if
there
is
not
enough
money
to
go
around?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
didn't...
didn't
congress,
even
before
that,
impose
a
significant
limitation
on
how
much
the
secretary
could
pay?
what
do
you
with
the
provision
in...
in
(b)
of...
of
the
section
that
you
were
reading
from?
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
in
this
subchapter,
the
provision
of
funds
under
this
subchapter
is
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations
and
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
reduce
funding
for
programs,
projects,
or
activities
serving
a
tribe
to
make
funds
available
to
another
tribe
or
tribal
organization
under
this
chapter.
i
mean,
what...
what
money
that
the
secretary
expends
is...
is
not
expended
for
programs,
projects,
or
activities
that
serve
a
tribe?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
all
very
good,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
the
last
paragraph
begins
with
the
word
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
subchapter.
so
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me,
overrides
everything
else.
unless...
unless
you
can
persuade
me
that
that...
that
that
provision
doesn't
give
the
secretary
the
authority
to...
to
allocate
the
available
funds
among
other
activities
that
serve
tribes,
i...
i
think
it
trumps
whatever
else
you
appeal
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
justice
antonin
scalia
21
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
21a,
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
put
it...
this
is
a
competition
between
two
bureaucracies,
the
tribal
bureaucracy
that
is
administering
the
program
and
the
secretary's
bureaucracy
which
is
administering
the
program
of
programs.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
not
as
though
it's
a
bureaucracy
against
the
people.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
to
turn
over
the
bureaucratic
management
of
these
programs
from
government
bureaucrats
to
tribal
bureaucrats.
i
mean,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you...
you
paint
it
as
though
the...
you
know,
who
cares
about
the
bureaucrats.
the...
the
government
just
wasn't
interested
in
the
bureaucrats.
that
may
well
be,
but
there...
there
are
bureaucrats
at
both
ends
of
this
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
didn't
contract
it
out
to
the
government
of
iraq.
they
contracted
it
out
to
a
private
contractor.
i
mean,
what...
what
makes
this
unique
is
that
the
whole
purpose
of
it
was
to
give
these...
these
tribes
more
governmental
power,
more
self-determination.
the
whole
purpose
was
to
enable
the
tribes
to
act
as
governments.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
what
makes
it
different
from
private
contracts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even...
even
with
halliburton.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
halliburton
is
not
an
indian
tribe
and
doesn't
purport
to
be
governing
anybody.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
that.
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
less.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
it...
it's
not
talking
about
money
that's
otherwise
contractable.
it
says,
including
supportive
administrative
functions
that
are
otherwise
contractable.
it's
talking
about
a
limitation
upon
the
contractability
of
functions--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
the
use
of
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
rely
on
the
statement
in
(a)
that
the...
the
only
funds
that
are
available
are
funds
that
include
funds
to...
to
pay
for
supportive
administrative
functions
that
are
otherwise
contractable.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
funds
that
are
used
to
pay
for
administrative
functions
that
are
not
contractable.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
can't
limit
it
to
inherent
government
functions.
both
the
inherent
and
the
noninherent
government
functions
would
fall
within
this
provision--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
read
it
as
broadly
as
you've
just
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
strange
to
talk
of
reducing...
is...
is
not
required
to
reduce
funding
for
a
new
program.
i
mean,
for
a
new
program,
there
isn't
any
funding.
how
can
you
reduce
the
funding
for
a
new
program?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
provision
makes
sense
with
regard
to
existing
programs,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
with
regard
to
proposed
programs.
