justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
mind
explaining
to
us
how
these
two
cases
relate?
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
decision
went
one
way
and
the
tenth
circuit
went
another.
and
are
the
claims
at
all
overlapping?
how
are
they
differentiated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they're
certainly
at
odds
on
the
legal
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
the
circumstances
any
different
in
the
two
situations,
the
cherokee
nation
case
and
the
one
in
the
federal
circuit?
are...
are
the
circumstances,
giving
rise
to
the
claim,
different
in
any
respect
that
could
account
for
a
difference
in
outcome?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
when
do
the
tribal
contractors
know
how
much
money
the
government
actually
will
have
available
to
spend?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the...
the
tribes
have
to
enter
contracts
not
knowing
how
much
money
is
going
to
be
there
at
the
end
of
the
day?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
so
how
was
that
appropriation
money
in
fact
used
by
the
federal
government,
do
you
say?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
the
appropriation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
tribes
had
already
entered
into
contracts.
now,
how
was
that
lump
sum
used?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
done
without
regard
to
the
contract
amounts
that
the
tribes
have
entered
into?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
in
fact
how
it
was
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
still
done
that
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
fine,
but
you
still
have
to
look
at
that
last
sentence
in
subsection
(b)
and
grapple
with
what
it
means.
the
secretary
is
not
required
to
reduce
funding
for
programs,
projects,
or
activities
serving
a
tribe
to
make
funds
available
to
another
tribe.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
does
it
mean?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
language
is
the
same.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
phrase
is
the
same,
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
srinivasan,
do
you
say
that
the
contracts
that
were
entered
into
by
ihs
and
the
tribes
did
somehow
contract
away
federal...
inherent
federal
functions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
didn't
violate
that
section,
did
they?
the
contracts
that
we're
talking
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
that.
we're
dealing
with
contracts
that
didn't
violate
that
section.
and
you're
just
saying
that
some
of
the
lump
sum
appropriation
was
diverted
by
the
government
to
pay
for
some
kind
of
core
federal
function,
not
that
the
contracts
violated
that
provision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
way
to
avoid
these
problems
now?
has
anything
changed?
