justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
basic
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
maybe
others
understand,
but
i'm
confused.
imagine
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
indians.
it
is
simply
an
ordinary
contract.
now,
my
understanding
is
that
ordinary
contracts
say
subject
to
appropriations.
so
we
have
to
decide
was
there
an
appropriation.
in
our
imaginary
department
of
government,
the
appropriation
is
$1
billion.
nothing
is
earmarked
for
anything.
they
enter
into
contracts
that
amount
to
$999
million.
now,
they
pay
out
$990
million,
and
their...
what
the
department
says
is,
look,
everybody
knows
we
need
at
least
$10
million
to
run
our
central
bureaucracy.
so
there's
no
valid
contract
here.
the
appropriation
wasn't
made.
now,
my
understanding
of
ordinary
government
contract
law
is
to
decide
whether
that
$10
million
was
in
principle
available
for
the
contracts.
you
look
to
something
called
the
purpose-time-amount
test.
so
was
it
during
the
same
time?
yes.
is
it
in
an
appropriate
amount?
but
is
it
available
for
this
purpose?
ah,
i'm
not
sure.
all
right.
now,
i
want...
if
i
have
the...
the
theory
of
it
right,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
the
money
was
in
your
case
that
is
the
equivalent
of
the
$10
million
in
my
example
that
you
believe
in
principle
was
available
to
pay
these...
for
this
indian
expenditure.
just
pretend
it's
a
regular
contract.
what
is
the
equivalent
of
that
$10
million?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
and
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
forget
this
statute
for
a
second
because
i'll
stop
you
there.
i
want
you
to
tell
me
why
those
sums...
i
get
the
time.
i
get
the
amount.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
explain
to
me
why
it
is
one
of
the
purposes
for
which
those
appropriations
were
made,
i.e.,
the
equivalent
of
the
$10
million,
to
go
pay
for
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
one
of
the
purposes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
think...
you
and
the
government
agree
then
that
were
this
an
ordinary
contract
case,
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
legally
binding
contract
would
have
been
entered
into
and
the
clause,
subject
to
appropriations,
would
not
work
for
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
were
it
an
ordinary--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--were
it
an
ordinary
contract.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
our
issue
as
far
as
you're
concerned...
and
i'll
ask
the
government
the
same
question...
is,
is
this
contract
different
from
an
ordinary
contract
because
of
a,
b,
c,
d
indian
reservations,
et
cetera?
and
your
claim
is,
i
can't
find
any
difference.
and
their
claim
is
there
will
be
some
difference.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
just
did,
the
2
percent.
so
my
question
to
you
is
the
same.
i
asked,
let's
imagine
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
tribes,
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it
was
a
typical,
ordinary
government
contract
for
pencils.
all
right?
or
for
soda
water.
now,
and
everything
were
the
same.
under
those
circumstances,
just
an
ordinary
contract...
and
they
point
to
that
2
percent
and
they
say
that
is
legally
speaking...
we
didn't
expect
you
to
pay
it.
we
just
won
a
lawsuit
in
the
court
of
claims.
but...
but
we
have...
we
have
a
contract
here.
okay?
that's
what
we're
just
saying.
the...
the
subject
to
appropriation
clause
doesn't
nix
the
contract
because
that
2
percent
is
available,
legally
speaking,
time,
purpose,
and...
and
amount.
classic.
now,
what's
the
government's
view
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
available
or
not
were
this
an
ordinary
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking...
all
right.
are...
is
the
government's
view
then
let's
treat
this
just
as
an
ordinary
contract?
still
it...
there
was
no
money
available.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
legally
speaking
under
the
time-purpose-amount
test.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
would
like
an
answer
to
my
question,
yes
or
no.
if
this
were
an
ordinary
contract
with
a
subject
to
appropriations
clause,
is...
would
the
government
be
saying
this
is
invalid
because
the
appropriations
were
not
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
must
be
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
what
it
is
is
a
contract
for
pencils.
can
you
not...
is
it
impossible--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
make...
you
see
what
i'm
driving--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--correct,
and
which
are
the
funds
that
are...
that
would
be
available
here?
which
are
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
this
were
under
blackhawk.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
let
me
do
this
then.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
if
this
were
a
classic,
ordinary
contract,
the
money
would
have
been
available
legally
speaking.
nobody
says
practically
speaking,
and
they
could
have
brought
their
lawsuit.
now,
tell
me
specifically,
if
you
can...
and
this
may
take
you
the
whole
time.
you
want
to
make
whatever
argument
you
want.
what
is
it
that's
special
about
this
contract
that
brings
it
out
of
ordinary
contracting
principles?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
that.
what
it
says
is
otherwise
contractable.
and
they
could
certainly...
for
a
lay
person
like
me
in
this,
you'd
think,
well,
we
could
have
a
provision
that
says
$180,000
is
hereby
authorized
to
be
spent
only
for
the
secretary
of
veterans
affairs
or
secretary
of
interior.
well,
if
it
said
that,
then
that's
not
otherwise
contractable
because
there's
a
statutory
limit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
otherwise
contractable
sounds
like
a...
a
statutory
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that
all
may
be
true,
of
course.
they're
talking
about
don't
contract
out
to
the
indians
something
that
should
be
done
in
washington.
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
issue?
we're
talking,
i
thought,
about...
about
government
contracts.
people
who
enter
into
government
contracts
need
certainty.
they
have
to
know
whether
that
word,
subject
to
appropriations,
invalidates
the
contract
or
whether
they
have
a
valid
contract.
and
a
set
of
principles
have
come
up
that
are
used
to
decide
that.
and
under
that
set
of
principles,
money
is
available
to
pay
for
the
contract
if
it's
time,
purpose,
and
amount.
okay?
that's
the
principle.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i
don't
see
anything
contrary
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he's
not.
but
if...
if...
where
i'm
really
coming
from,
to
be
honest...
and
i'd
like...
you
might
as
well
reply
to
what
i'm
actually...
is
why
i'm
asking
these
slightly
hostile
questions.
[laughter]
i...
i
read
here...
look,
the
question
really
is
was
this
money
like
the
bureaucracy
money.
is
it
legally
speaking
an
appropriation
available,
not
practically
speaking
but
legally?
and
here
it
seems
to
me,
in
looking
through
this
somewhat
quickly,
that
you
say
no,
but
the
board
of
contract
appeals
say
yes.
and
so
i
think
in
my
mind,
you
know,
one
group
of
people
who
really
know
about
this
is
the
board
of
contract
appeals.
so
if
they're
saying
that
money
from
a
contract
point...
a
point
of
normal
contract
law
is
legally
available,
i
promise
you
i'm
predisposed
to
think
they're
right.
so
i
might
as
well
expose
that
to
you
so
you
can
tell
me
now
why
i'm
wrong
or
they're
wrong
or
whatever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is...
is...
the
kind...
the
money
that's
available
to
one
tribe
can't
be
taken
for
the
other.
but
i
thought
the
board
of
contract
appeals
was
saying
taking
that
into
account,
there's
still
enough
money
left
over.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
i
thought
you
should
take
money
from
one
tribe
to
give
it
to
another.
what
did
they
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
thinking
the
board
of
contract
appeals
and
the
federal
circuit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
they
disagree
with
you
about
the
purpose
in
respect
to
the
core
government
function.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
two
indian
tribes,
the
cherokee
and
the
shoshone-paiute
entered
into
contracts
with
the
federal
government.
the
government
promised
to
pay
for
a
certain
costs
called
contract-support
costs
that
were
related
to
some
health
services,
and
the
government
just
did
not
pay
in
full.
the
government's
point
was,
well,
congress
did
not
appropriate
enough
money
to
pay
for
all
contracts
like
this
that
we
have
made
with
a
whole
lot
of
indian
tribes,
so
what
we
are
going
to
do
is
take
all
the
available
money
and
we
will
allocated
it,
and
we
will
give
each
tribe
their
fair
share.
well,
the
tribes,
these
particular
two,
did
not
like
that
and
they
said
we
want
all
the
money
you
promised
not
just
some
share
of
it,
and
they
brought
a
lawsuit.
in
fact,
two
of
them,
one
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
one
in
the
federal
circuit,
and
the
tribes
won
the
one
in
the
federal
circuit
and
they
lost
the
one
in
the
tenth
circuit.
so,
we
took
cert
to
iron
out
that
difference.
now,
the
tribes'
basic
argument
was
they
said
look
at
general
contracting
law.
now,
under
general
contracting
law,
the
fact
the
congress
did
not
appropriate
enough
money
for
all
the
contracts
like
these,
as
beside
the
point.
they
appropriated
enough
money
unrestricted
for
our
contract.
it
is
as
if
you
had
a
contract
with
a
pencil
manufacturer
for
a
million
dollars
worth
of
pencils.
the
appropriation
was
$5
million.
that
is
enough
to
cover
the
one.
now,
maybe
the
government
entered
into
ten
for
$10
million.
it
is
enough
to
cover
all
ten,
that
is
true,
but
it
covers
ours.
and
that,
they
said,
is
good
enough
to
make
the
promise
binding
under
ordinary
law
and
the
government
has
not
contested
that
point.
rather,
the
government
says,
these
contracts
are
special.
so,
we
examined
the
statute
to
see
what
was
special
about
it.
now
the
government
says,
look
at
that
statute;
it
is
just
about
special
services
to
indians.
well,
we
did
look
at
the
statute
and
it
does
say
the
government
has
to
pay
contract
support
costs,
and
it
says
nothing
about
the
promise
being
special.
indeed
it
puts
the
language
about
what
the
government
has
to
promise
in
a
section
called
model
contract
and
it
uses
the
word
contract
426
times,
but
who
is
counting?
anyway,
that
word,
"contract",
normally
refers
to
"a
promise
for
the
breach
of
which
the
law
gives
a
remedy".
so,
we
could
not
find
anything
special
in
that
part
of
the
contract.
now,
the
contract,
in
that
part
of
the
statute,
the
statute
also
uses
the
word
subject
to
the
availability
of
appropriations.
they
are
on
stronger
ground,
the
government
there,
but
not
strong
enough
because
when
we
looked
into
the
meaning
of
that
term,
we
found
it
has
a
special
technical
meaning
which
does
not
help
the
government
here
which
is
explained
in
the
opinion.
then
the
government
points
to
some
other
language
in
the
statute
which
says,
that
government
need
not
"reduce
funding
for
programs,
projects,
or
activities
serving
a
tribe
to
make
funds
available
to
another
tribw."
and
the
government
says,
well,
the
indian
health
service,
almost
all
of
our
money
goes
to
such
purposes.
some
tribe
or
other,
but
it
did
not
say
all.
it
said
almost
all.
and
the
almost
is
where
the
problem
lies
because
when
you
look
at
that
almost
you
see
there
is
enough
money
left
over
to
pay
these
contracts.
at
least
the
government
does
not
deny
that.
but,
says
the
government,
we
have
to
use
that
extra
money
to
pay,
for
example,
the
salaries
of
our
washington
office.
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
pay
these
tribes
and
close
down
the
office?
but
this
argument
is
just
a
variation
on
a
theme.
namely,
that
the
government
has
better
more
important,
indeed
essential
uses
for
money
that
is
in
and
unrestricted
appropriation.
and
this
kind
of
argument,
even
if
it
is
true,
and
we
assume
it
is
here,
is
not
ordinarily
a
sufficient
reason
for
the
government
to
disown
an
otherwise
binding
contractual
promise.
what
is
the
government
to
do?
well,
the
law,
as
we
understand
it,
expects
the
government
to
avoid
placing
itself
in
this
kind
of
dilemma.
for
example,
by
refraining
from
making
less
essential
contractual
commitments
in
the
first
place
or
by
asking
congress
in
advance
to
protect
funds
needed
for
essential
purposes
with
statutory
restrictions
or
by
seeking
additional
funding
or,
if
necessary,
by
using
those
unrestricted
funds
for
the
more
essential
purpose
while
leaving
the
contractor
free
to
pursue
appropriate
legal
remedies
which
is
just
what
happened
here.
finally,
the
government
says
that
congress
passed
a
special
statute
later
on
that
makes
its
promises
made
earlier
non-binding.
that
statute,
however,
admits
of
a
different
interpretation
which
does
not
help
the
government
and
we
use
that
different
interpretation
because
otherwise
there
will
be
a
fairly
serious
constitutional
problem.
now,
for
these
and
other
reasons
which
we
set
forth
at
greater
length
in
today's
opinion,
we
hold
in
favor
of
the
indian
tribes.
we
reverse
the
tenth
circuit.
we
affirm
the
federal
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
result;
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
these
cases.
