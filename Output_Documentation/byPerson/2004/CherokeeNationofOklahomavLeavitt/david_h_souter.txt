justice
david
h.
souter
does
the...
do
the
actual
contracts
reduce
the...
the
csc's
to
a
dollar
amount
or--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so...
so
we
know...
they...
they
knew
at
the
moment
the
contract
was
signed
what
it
was
going
to
cost.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
you
said
a
second
ago
the
secretary
had
the
option
to
reprogram.
what
do
you
mean
by
reprogram?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
what
you
mean
by
programming?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
programming
is
allocating
various
segments
of
the
lump
sum
to
various
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
may...
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
and
tell
me
if
i
understand
the...
the
position
in
your
brief
correctly.
i
thought
the
position
that
you
took
there
was
ultimately
regardless
of
what
the
notwithstanding
clause
means,
there's
enough
money
to
pay
all
the
contracts
in
the
appropriation
that
is
actually
made.
and
if
any
money
is
going
to
be
squeezed,
the
person
who's
going
to
be
squeezed
or
the...
is
the...
is
the
agency
itself.
its
bureaucracy
is
going
to
have
less
money.
and
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
given
the
provisions
you
read
earlier
in
this
section,
congress
has
made
a
positive
decision
that
if
there's
a
choice
between
paying
the
contract
amounts
and
squeezing
the
bureaucracy,
the
bureaucracy
gets
squeezed.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
your
position,
do
you
have
to
even
grapple
with
difficulties
about
the
notwithstanding
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
you
could...
you
could...
the...
the
secretary
doesn't
have
to
reduce
funding
for
other
tribes.
the
secretary
can
pay
the
full
contract
costs,
and
if
anybody
is
going
to
get
the
short
end,
it's
going
to
be
the
bureaucracy.
justice
david
h.
souter
just
give
them
the...
just
give
them
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
includes
the
2
percent
that
you
keep
referring
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
the
other...
the
other
side
says
you
don't
have
to
get
to
that
because
you
could
have
paid
the
contract
amounts
here
without
reducing
funds
available
for
other
tribes.
it's
simply
that
it
would
have
squeezed
you
in
your
budget,
your...
your
headquarters
operating
budget
for
ihs.
so
they
say,
if
i
understand
them,
that
the...
that
the
nonreduction
clause
doesn't
save
you
here
because
you
could
have
paid
it
without
reducing
things
for
other
tribes.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
ever
define
them
as
noncontractable?
i
mean,
i...
i...
your
answer,
i
suppose,
is
well,
what...
what
do
you
think
they're
talking
about,
but
does
it
ever
expressly
get
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
point
of
contractability?
justice
david
h.
souter
thank
you,
but
apologize
to
him.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
you
said
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no.
but
you
got
a
conflict
apparently
between
the
committee
reports
and
what
seems
to
be
pretty
clear
law,
which
says
we're
going
to
treat
these
contracts
as
contracts,
not
as
intergovernmental
agreements.
and
in...
in
that
conflict,
i
don't
see
why
contracting
principles
don't
trump
the
committee
reports.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
their...
their
argument
is
that
you
can
pay
the
contract
amount
without
robbing
other
tribes
of
the
amounts
that
the...
that
the
nonreduction
clause
refers
to.
they
are
saying...
i
think
they're
saying,
look,
you,
the
governmental
bureaucracy,
get
squeezed.
yes.
and
if
so,
the
contract
comes
first
and
you
have
to
live
with
the
squeeze
and
go
back
to
congress
and
say,
we're
doing
what
you
told
us
and
we're
getting
squeezed
out
of
existence.
i
think
that's
what
they're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
that's
true,
then
everything...
then
every
penny
in
the...
in
the
ihs
bureaucracy
qualifies.
i
mean,
that
swallows
the...
that
swallows
the
entire
budget.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
but
i
mean,
just
conceptually
isn't
that...
isn't
that
the...
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
srinivasan,
you...
you
alluded
a
moment
ago
in...
in
answering
justice
ginsburg,
i
guess,
to
declarations
on
file
on
the
tenth
circuit
case
that...
that
specifically
said
we
would
have
to
reduce
funds
available
for
other
programs.
did
those
declarations
get
specific
in
the
way
that
her
original
question
was...
was
asking
about?
did
it
say...
did
the
declarations
say
we
will
have
to
reduce
the
x
program
for
the
navajo
tribe
and
the
y
program
for
the
apache
tribe
and
so
on,
or
was
it...
did
the
declarations
simply
say,
as
a
general
matter,
we
would
have
to
reduce
allocations
for
other
tribes?
