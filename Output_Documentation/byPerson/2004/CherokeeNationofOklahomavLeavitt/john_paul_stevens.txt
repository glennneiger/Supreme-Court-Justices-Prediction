john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
the
cherokee
nation
against
thompson
and
thompson
against
the
cherokee
nation.
mr.
miller.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
mr.
srinivasan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
basic
question
that
i'm
having
trouble
following?
as
i
understand,
you're
saying
98
percent
of
the
appropriation
have
been
allocated
to
programs,
projects,
activities,
and
so
forth
that
can't
be
reduced.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
would
have
prevented
the
secretary
from
allocating
only
96
percent
of
the
budget
to
those
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
his
budget
that
he
actually
worked
out
with
the
98
percent
was
not
mandated
by
the
statute,
as
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
part
but
not
in
whole.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the...
is
the
nub
of
what
you're
trying
to
tell
me
is
that
the
98
percent
was,
in
fact,
mandated
by
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
principal
part,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
that
mean
that
there
was
not
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
have
made
it
97
percent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
had
enough
money--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
pay
these
contract
obligations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
thing
that
troubles
me
is
it
seems
to
me
your
reading
of
the
statute
makes
the
contractual
problem...
provision
illusory
because
they
can
always
allocate
funds
to
all
these
other
projects
and
say,
well,
we've
already
used
up
the
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
telling
me
that
the
committee
reports
are...
are
binding
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you
can
interpret
those
comments
as
saying
we
don't...
they
did
not
leave
enough
room
in
the
budget
for
the
programs
we
now
want
to
support
and
our
prior
contractual
obligations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
interpret
what
you're
saying
as
the...
as
the...
the
government
adopting
a
budget
in
which
there's
not
enough
room
for
all
the
programs
it
wants
to
support
in
the
current
year
and
continuing
to
honor
the
obligations
under
the
existing
contracts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
you
have
about
4
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
breyer
has
an
opinion
to
announce
in
two
cases
involving
the
cherokee
nation
of
oklahoma.
