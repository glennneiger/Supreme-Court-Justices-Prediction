mr.
miller,
do--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--on...
on
the
interpretation
you've
just
explained
to
us,
does
that
mean
that
the
secretary
has
no
authority
under
this
statute
or
generally
to
reserve
some
portion
of
this
for
what
you
call
federal
functions,
that
it...
every
penny
of
the
appropriation
could
go
to
the
costs
of
this
contract
and
nothing
left
in
the
till
for
the
so-called
federal
functions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your...
your
answer
is,
yes,
if
it
came
to
that,
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
related.
suppose...
this
is
an
individual
action.
these
are
individual
actions.
they're
not
class
actions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
the
ones
who
come
to
court
to
sue
get
paid
in
full
even
though
there
may
be
many
other
self-determination
contracts
out
there,
and
that
if
you
gave
them
all
their
fair
share,
none
of
them
would
be
paid
in
full?
does
it
just
depend
on
first
come
to
court,
first
served,
and
the
less
litigious
are
just
out
of
luck?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
can't
say
that
the
government
agrees
to
that.
you
certainly
agree
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
do
you...
how
do
you
square
that
with
the...
on
page
14a...
reductions
and,
as
mr.
miller
read
to
us,
shall
not
be
reduced
to
make
funding
available
for
contract
managing...
monitoring
or
administration
by
the
secretary,
shall
not
be
reduced
by
the
secretary
to
pay
for
federal
functions,
including
but
not
limited
to,
and
then
a
string
of
what
i
assume
falls
under
the
heading
federal
functions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
these
noninherent
federal
functions
shall
not
be
reduced
to
pay
for
federal
functions?
so
there's
inherent
federal
functions
and
noninherent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on...
on
that
point...
on
that
point,
in
the
federal
circuit
judge
dyke
expressed
considerable
displeasure
with
the
government
because
he
said
three
times
i
said,
tell
me
what
existing
programs
with
other
tribes
would
have
been
reduced
if
these
contract
support
costs
are
paid
in
full.
and
he
said,
i
asked
them
again
and
again
and
again,
and
they
were
unresponsive.
so
since
the
government
declined
to
tell
the
court
what
programs...
existing
programs
with
other
tribes
would
have
been
reduced,
mustn't
we
assume,
as
i
think
the
federal
circuit
did,
that
the
proof
is
unavailable
and
no
existing
program
with
other
tribes
would
have
been
diminished?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
one
thing
is
existing
contracts,
things
that
are
already
ongoing,
and
then
another
thing
is,
well,
we
think
that
there's
a
new
program
that
could
be
good
for
some
tribe.
so
we're
going
to
put
that
new
program
in
and
say
that
that
steps
in
front
of
these
contract
support
costs.
are
we
talking
just
about
existing
programs
that...
that
the
government
has
made
a
commitment
to,
or
are
we
saying
the
government
is
at
liberty
to
benefit
tribes?
and
so
what
if
the
contract
support
costs
are,
as
a
result,
diminished?
we're
still
doing
good
for
tribes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
new
program
or
an
existing
program?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
was
there
that
difference
between
the
bia
that
got
the
statutory
caps
earlier
and
not
till,
was
it,
4
years
later
for
the
ihs?
