mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
61(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
defines
gross
income
to
include
all
income
from
whatever
source
derived.
as
this
court
has
held,
that
definition
is
sweeping
and
represents
an
intent
by
congress
to
exert
the
full
measure
of
its
taxing
power.
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
below,
by
excluding
from
respondent's
gross
income
the
portion
of
litigation
proceeds
paid
to
their
attorneys
under
contingent
fee
agreements,
is
inconsistent
with
two
longstanding
federal
tax
law
principles
for
defining
gross
income.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
but
for
the
alternative
minimum
tax,
there
would
be
an...
a
miscellaneous
itemized
deduction--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--under
section
212
of
the
code--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
would
be
subject
to
the
limit
of
the
2
percent
of
adjusted
gross
income
that
applies
to
itemized
deductions.
but
section
56(b)(1)(a)--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--of
the
adjusted
gross
income.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
for
the
year.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
it...
it
certainly
may,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i'm
not
sure
entirely
what
you're
referring
to
as
the
problem,
but
it
is
the
case
that...
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is
correct.
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i
mean...
and
let
me
make
two
points
about
that.
the
first
is
that
as
a...
as
a
general
matter,
the
tax
code
defines
gross
income
expansively,
and
there's
a
number
of
this
court's
cases
that
make
that
clear.
then...
then
the
question
becomes
are
there
deductions
provided
that
allow
for
certain
expenses
to
be
deducted.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
would
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
it's
not
a
question
that
i
have
examined
in
depth
in...
in
this
case
because
it's
not
presented,
but
as
a
general
matter--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
same
principles
would
apply
to
class
action
lawsuits
as
to
other
lawsuits
in
terms
of
the
taxation
of
litigation
proceeds.
it
may
very
well
be
the
case
in
a
number
of
class
action
contexts
that
when
applying
those
principles,
the
proper...
the
proper
analysis
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
taxpayer
doesn't
exert
sufficient
control
and
that
the
payment
of
attorney's
fees
is
not
in
response
to
a
debt
owed
by
the
taxpayer.
and
so
there
might
be
a
different
result.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
want
to
be
clear.
we
think
the
same
principles
apply
across
the
board
to
defining
gross
income.
in
applying
that
in
a
number
of
class
action
contexts,
the
proper
answer
may
be
that
it's
not
included
in
gross
income
because
there
wasn't
sufficient
control
and
because
it
wasn't
paid
in...
in
lieu
of
a
debt
owed
by
the
taxpayer.
but
here--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--again,
the
principles
would
apply
and
there
may
very
well
be
class
actions--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--again,
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
be
as
specific
as
i
can.
there
may
be
situations
in
which,
even
in
the
class
action
context,
there's
a
fee
agreement
between
the...
the
class
member
and
the
lawyer
so
that
the
payment
of
attorney's
fees
is
in
satisfaction
of
a
debt
owed
by
the
class
member,
and
in
that
situation
we
think
that
it
would
be--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
there...
there
are
situations--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--we
are
in
the
situation
in
which
there's
a
need
to
apply
the
general
principles
for
defining
gross
income.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and...
and
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out,
your
honor,
is
that
there
may
very
well
be
class
actions
where
it's
not
different.
there
may
be
some
when...
where
it
is
if
it's
the
case
that
there's
no
contractual
obligations
to
pay
the
fee...
pay
the
fee
between
the
class
member
and
the
attorney,
and
if
it's
the
case
that
the
class
member
really
exerts
no
meaningful
control
over
the...
over
the
attorney's
fees
portion--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
is
certainly
one
of
the
factors
that...
that
the
commissioner
has
looked
to
in
those
class--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--again,
those
are
all
facts--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
just
to
be
clear,
i...
i
don't
think
the
commissioner
has
ever
taken
the
position
that
all
class
actions
don't
present
the...
the
possibility
of
the
attorney's
fees
portion
of
the
award
being
included
in...
in
the
class
member's
gross
income.
now,
there
are
real
enforcement
issues,
as
a
practical
matter,
to
trying
to...
to
trying
to
implement
that.
you
can
imagine
a
number
of
class
actions--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
presumably,
your
honor,
that...
only
the
portion
of
the
attorney's
fees
that
would
be
attributable
to
the...
the
named
representative's
recovery
would
be
included
in
the
named
representative's
gross
income.
i
don't
think
that
the
named
representative
would
be
on
the
hook,
if
you
will,
for
all
of
the
attorney's
fees
that
would
relate
to
other
class
members'
recoveries.
but
i
think
what
all
this
points
out
is
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--in
a
number
of
instances,
yes,
your
honor.
again,
the...
the
way
that
we
think
that
class
action
cases
should
be
resolved
is
the
same
way
that...
that
these
issues
are
approached
in
all
cases,
which
is
to
look
at
the
type
of
relationship
that
exists
between
the...
the
client
and
the
attorney
to
see
whether
the
payment
is
made
in...
in
response
to
a
debt
owed
by
the
client
and
also
to
look
to
the
degree
of
control
that
the
client
has
over
the...
the
underlying
source
of
income.
and
in
this
context,
it
is--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--as
a
flat
fee?
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
i
think
in
fact
it
is
undisputed
in...
in
the...
in
these
cases
that
if
the
payment
of
attorney's
fees
had
either
been
under
an
hourly
rate
arrangement
or
a
flat
fee
arrangement,
that
the
entire
amount
of
the
litigation
proceeds
would
be
included
in
the...
in
the
respondent's
gross
income
and
nothing
about
the
contingent
fee
arrangements
here
should...
should
alter
that
result.
the
respondents--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i'm
trying
to
recall
that
amicus
brief.
i
believe
that...
was
that
an
argument,
i
believe,
about
the
application
of
section
83
of
the
tax
code
when
you
have
a
transaction--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--in
exchange
for
services
and
you
provide
property?
mr.
david
b.
salmons
we
think
that
the
better
way
to
analyze
this
is
that
in
fact
there
was
no
transfer
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action,
and
so
we
think
that...
that
we...
that
gets
into
a
very
complicated
area
as
to
how
you
value
the
attorney's
fees
at
the
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
point
i
was
making--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
there
is
an
agreement
to
pay
a
fee
for
a
service,
and
in
that
sense
there
is
a
transaction,
yes.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
again,
your
honor,
we
think
that
transaction
is
essentially
identical
to
numerous
transactions
that
take
place
every
day
out
in
the
real
world
where...
where
taxpayers
retain
professional
services
in
exchange
for
a
commission
or
a
percentage
of
the
income
that's
generated.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that
is
absolutely
correct.
i
don't
see
any
basis
for
distinguishing
between--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--the
attorneys
here
and...
and
a...
and
an
agent
negotiating
a
book
contract
for
an
author
or
a
financial
analyst.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
author
in
those...
in
that
situation
would
receive
the
same
deduction
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
703
of
the
american
jobs
creation
act
where
congress
just
addressed
in
part
the...
the
issue
raised
in
these
cases--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--they
would
have
an
itemized...
excuse
me...
a
miscellaneous
itemized
deduction
for
the
cost
incurred
in...
in
producing
income
that
under
the
alternative
minimum
tax
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
i
will...
i
will
have
to
allow
respondents
to
speak
for
themselves
to
that
question,
but
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
that
is
not
in
dispute
in
these
cases
or
in
any
of
the
cases
that
have
been
litigated
that...
that
but...
that
but
for
the
alternative
minimum
tax,
the
way
this
would
have
been
handled
is
that
there
would
have
been
a
miscellaneous
itemized
deduction
under
section
212
of
the
code
for
the
cost
incurred
in
producing
income,
and
that
the
alternative
minimum
tax,
along
with,
by
the
way,
a
large
number
of
other
perfectly
valid
deductions,
get
disallowed
under
the
alternative
minimum
tax.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that...
that...
i
know
that
were...
that
was
the
facts,
your
honor,
in
the...
in
the
banks
case,
that
there
was
a
check
made
out
to
both.
in
fact...
in
fact,
there
was--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
your
honor,
we
disagree
with
that
for,
it
seems
to
me,
at
least
three
reasons.
the
first
is
that
at
the
time
the
client
entered
into
the
fee
agreement,
he
certainly
had
control
then.
he
had
complete
control
over
his
cause
of
action.
he
was--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
there
was
an
entitlement
to
recover.
now,
there
might
have
been
a
dispute
as
to
the
proper
amount
or
whether
that
claim
was
valid,
but
he
was
entitled
to
recover
based
on
the
injury
he
suffered
that
was
cognizable
at
law
and
that
gave
raise
to
a
cause
of
action.
now,
in
exchange
for
legal
services,
he
promised
to
pay
a
portion
of
the
recovery
to
the
lawyer.
that
is
a
promise
to
pay
a
fee.
that
is
not
an
assignment
or
any
other
transfer
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action.
and
it
is
undisputed,
i
think--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
two
responses
to
that
question,
if
i
may.
the
first
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
is
the
client
that
controls
the
cause
of
action
and
throughout
the
time
period,
even
after
they...
they
enter
into
an...
a
contingent
fee
agreement,
it
is
the
client
that
owns
and
controls
the
cause
of
action
and
he
decides
whether
to
settle.
he
decides
whether
to
press
forward
or
withdraw
the
case.
he
decides
whether
to
fire
the
lawyer
or
not.
he
is
a...
he
controls
the
source
of
the
income.
therefore--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--well,
presumably,
your
honor,
if
he's
already...
he's
already
promised
that
to
the
attorney,
he
would
be
in
violation
of
his
agreement
with
the
attorney
if
he
did
so,
and
his
attorney
could
sue
him
to
recover
or
the
dentist
could
sue
him
to
recover.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
because
he's...
he's
given
it
away.
in
that
sense
i
think...
and...
and
in
answering
this,
if
i
may
just
go
back
to
one
point
that
justice
souter
made
and
that
is
that
i
don't
think
it's
the
case
that
our
analysis
turns
at
all
on
how
you
value
the
claim,
either
at
the
time
of
the
fee
agreement
or
afterwards.
our
analysis
says
at
all
relevant
times,
regardless
of
whether
the
value
changed
or
not,
the
client
was
at
all
times
in
control
of
the
underlying
source
of
income,
and
it's
just
as
if
in
helvering
v.
horst
the
father
assigns
the...
the
bond
coupon
to
his
son,
but
he
controls
the
underlying
source
of
income.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
true.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
that
would
be
equally
true
of
an
assignment
of
a
stock
dividend
while
i
retain
the
stock.
i
may
not
know
what
the
dividend
payment
is
going
to
be,
but
if
i
control
the
underlying
source
of
income,
i.e.,
the
stock,
then
the
transfer
to
someone
else
of
the
dividend
doesn't
alter
the
incident
of
tax,
even
if
it's
unknown.
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
lucas
v.
earl,
the
husband
and
wife
in
that
case
entered
into
agreement
to
assign
to
each
other
50
percent
of
their
income
in
1901,
long
before
the
income
tax
was
even
instituted,
and
the
tax
years
at
issue
in
that
case
were
1920
and
1921.
if
anything,
it
was
much
more
speculative
and
uncertain
what
income
would
have
been
earned
20
years
later
in
that
case,
and
that
did
not
stop
the
court
from--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--applying
this
principle
that--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
to
my
knowledge,
the...
the
irs
has
had
a
consistent
position
that
the
entire
amount
of
litigation
proceeds,
including
the
amount
that
may
be
paid
to
a
lawyer
under
a
contingent
fee
agreement,
even
in
the
condemnation
context,
is...
is
included
in
the
gross
income
of...
of
the
taxpayer.
and
i
would
point
your
honor
to
the
case
out
of
the
federal
circuit,
baylin
v.
united
states.
that
case
involved
a
condemnation
action,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
addressed
the
issue
that's
presented
in
these
cases
and
concluded
that
it
was
includable
in
gross
income.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and...
and
i
would
point
out,
your
honor...
and
this
has
to
do,
i
think,
with
the
impact
of
the
new
legislation
that's
been
pointed
to
in
the
supplemental
briefs...
that
at
least
six
of
the
court
of
appeals
cases
addressing
the
issue
presented
in
these
cases
involved
claims
that
would
not
be
covered
under
the
new
section
703
because
they...
they
don't
involve
claims
for
unlawful
discrimination
or...
or
fca
claims
or
certain
medicare
claims--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
my
response
to
that
is
that,
first--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
congress
has
looked
at...
at
this
issue,
and
in
the
new
section
that
i
just
referred
to,
section
703--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--that
has
occurred,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
and...
and
congress
responded
to
concerns
about
that
very
result--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--in
the
new
section.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
no,
your
honor.
it
is--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
think
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but
we
do
think,
your
honor,
that
the
only
limit
on
congress'
taxing
authority
would
be
the
constitution,
and
i
don't
see
a
constitutional
violation
in
disallowing
a
deduction,
but--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
if
i
may.
the
way
i
would
respond
to
that
concern
is
that
the
proper
way
to
address
it
is
not
as
the
courts
below
did
and
as
respondents
urge,
to
alter
or
distort
the
general
definition
for
gross
income
under
the...
under
the
tax
code
which
may
have
broad
ramifications
in
a
number
of
areas
outside
of
this
one,
but
to
go
to
congress,
as
in
fact
people
have
done,
and
to
get
them
to
make...
make
additional
deductions
or
otherwise
alter
the
alternative
minimum
tax,
which
generates
the
primary
concern
i
think
at
issue
in
these
cases.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
that's
the
proper
way
to
handle
that.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
they
were...
they
were
liable
for
a
tax
greater
than
what
they
took
in.
those
were
pointed
to
congress--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
believe
that's
correct.
those
were
pointed
out
to
congress
and
that
was
part
of
what
motivated
congress--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--to
enact
section
703
to
protect--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
my...
my
understanding
is
that
the
tax
was
assessed
and
i
don't
know
whether--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
if
i--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--misremembered
that
case,
i
apologize.
my...
my
recollection
was
that...
was
that
the
court
in
that
case
had
included
the
attorney's
fees
in
gross
income.
but...
but--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--but...
but
again,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
i
think
the...
the
basic
point
to
recall
here
is
that
the
definition
of
gross
income
cuts
across
the
tax
code.
if
there
are
concerns
about
application,
then
the
proper
result
is
to
go
to
congress,
as
has
been
done.
congress
has
addressed
the
very
concerns
cited
by
respondents
and
the
amici
in
this
case,
and
that
specifically
is
the...
the
application
on
civil
rights
plaintiffs.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
your
honor,
it...
there
may
be...
there
may
be
a
takings
issue
at
some
point.
again,
there
may
be
constitutional
limitations.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
but
i
think,
your--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--your
honor,
i
think
when...
when
what
you're
talking
about
is
how
to
define--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--again,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
as
a
general
matter,
the...
the
proper
definition
of
gross
income
would
include
the
attorney's
fees
portion
of
litigation
awards.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
when
congress--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
what
i
would
say
is
that
the
thing
to
focus
on
is
what
congress
actually
enacted
and
it
makes
clear
that
all
the
litigation
proceeds--
mr.
david
b.
salmons
--i...
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
answer
is
that
the...
the
legislation
itself
makes
clear
that
it's
included
in
gross
income
and
an
above-the-line
deduction
is
provided,
and
that
the
colloquy
was
referring
to
a
prior
version
of
the
bill
that
would
have
been
retroactive
in
part.
the
new
bill
is
not
retroactive,
and
we
think
it's
clear
that
it
does
work
a
change
because
from,
among
other
reasons,
it's
undisputed
that
if
these
fees
had
been
paid
on
an
hourly
fee
basis,
they
would
have
been
included
in
gross
income
and...
and
the
alternative
minimum
tax
would
apply.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
we
do
not.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
we
do
not.
[laughter]
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you,
your
honor.
it
is
clear
that
the
only
thing
that
respondents'
attorneys
earned
under
the
fee
agreements
was
the
right
to
be
paid
a
fee
for
their
services.
in
petitioner's
view,
those
agreements
don't
even
give
rise
to
an
assignment
of
income
in
the
ordinary
sense.
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
fee
agreement
in
the
banaitis
case...
the
banks'
fee
agreement
is
not
in
the
record...
among
other
things,
it
makes
clear
that
if
there
is
a
termination...
and
it
provides
lots
of
grounds
on
which
the
attorney-client
relationship
can
be
terminated...
that
the
attorney
will
be
paid
a
reasonable
fee,
calculated
at
the
sum
of
$175
per
hour.
that
doesn't
sound
like
an
assignment
of
any
income
or
even
an
assignment
of
the
underlying
cause
of
action.
even
if
it
did,
it
is
clear
that
in
every
assignment
of
income
case,
the
assignor
loses
control
over
that
income
that
he
assigned.
that
doesn't
stop
the
application
of
the
proper
tax
principles,
however.
the...
the
respondents
in
these
cases
suffered
a
legally
cognizable
injury.
they
had
a
claim.
that
claim
entitled
them
to
a
recovery.
they
retained
services
to
pursued
that
claim.
if
they
had
paid
their
lawyers
on
an
hourly
basis,
those
lawyers
may
have
been
just
as
necessary
to
the
actual
outcome
of
the
case
as
their
contingent
fee
attorneys.
both
the...
an
hourly
fee
attorney
and
a
contingent
fee
attorney
in
both
of
the
states
at
issue
here...
and
in
fact,
in
all
states
of
which
i'm
aware...
received
precisely
the
same
attorney's
lien.
that
lien
makes
clear
that
the
relationship
between
attorney
and
client
starts
out
as
that
between
a
master
and
an
agent
and
then
is
converted
through
the
fee
agreement
to
that
between
a
creditor
and
a
debtor,
and
the
lien
secures
the
debt
and
ensures
its
payment.
when
the
proceeds
from
the
litigation
are
paid
to
the
attorney,
it
satisfies
the
respondent's
debt
and
is
therefore
income
to
the
attorney.
under
the
separate
and
alternative
ground
of
this
court's
old
colony
decision,
it
goes
far
and
beyond
even
the
holding
with
regard
to
an
assignment
of
income.
to
address
just
a
couple
of
questions
that
came
up,
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
class
action
context,
again,
as
i
indicated,
there
are
a
number
of
differences.
and
just
to
be
a
little
more
specific
about
some
of
them,
generally
speaking
there's
no
unilateral
right
to
settle
a...
a
case
by
class
members.
there's
no
unilateral
right
to
dismiss
the
case,
and
there's
no
right
to
a
determined
fee.
mr.
david
b.
salmons
thank
you.
