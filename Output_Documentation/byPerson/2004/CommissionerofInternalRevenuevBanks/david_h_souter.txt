justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
isn't
there
as
much
control
in
each
case?
i
mean,
the...
somebody
goes
to
a
lawyer
with
a
claim
and
says,
press
the
claim
for
me,
recover
if
you
can.
what's
the
difference
in...
in
terms
of
control?
so
that
if
you
win
this
case,
why
doesn't
it
apply
to
class
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
and
i...
i
want
to
know
why
the
result
would
be
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
would...
why
would
that
analysis
appear?
certainly
there's...
there's
not
going
to
be
any
fee
paid
in
the...
in
the
paradigm
example
of
the
class
action
without
a
recovery.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we're
in
the...
so
we're
in
the
situation
we're
in
right
now,
aren't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
let
me
just...
i'll
just
press
the
point
one
more
time.
i
don't
understand,
based
on
what
you've
said,
why
the
class
action
result
would
be
different
from
the
result
that
you're
arguing
for
here
if
you
win
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
salmons,
doesn't
the
plausibility
of
your
argument
here
rest
on
the
assumption
that
what
the...
that
the
cause
of
action
at
the
time
the...
that
the
plaintiff
made
the
agreement
with
the
lawyer
is
a
cause
of
action
which
has
the
same
value
as
the
ultimate
recovery
that
the
lawyer
gets?
whereas,
in
fact,
the
cause
of
action
at
the
time
of
the
agreement
with
the
lawyer
has
an
inchoate
value.
the...
the
value
that
is
actually
realized
is
going
to
depend
in
part
on
the...
on
the
skill
and...
and
the...
the
gumption
of
the
lawyer.
so
that
the...
what
i'm
getting
at...
and...
and
going
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
value
realized
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
sue
are
two
different
figures.
and
i
don't
see
realistically
how
the
client
has
complete
control
over
the
value
realized,
which
we
don't
even
know
until
the
lawyer
has
done
his
work
and
gotten
the
check.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
bond
coupon
has
a
certain
value
at
the
time
the
father
assigns
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
thing
that
has
to
be
realized
after
the
assignment
of
the
coupon
is
the
passage
of
time
at
which
it
will
be
payable.
here
we
do
not
have
a
definite
value.
we
don't
know...
there's
no
way
to
know
for
sure
what
the
value
will
be
until
the
lawsuit
is
over
with.
the...
the
two
are
not
comparable.
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
we
make
of
the
fact
that
two
senators
apparently
don't
agree
with
that
position?
i
mean,
i...
i'm
referring
to
the
colloquy
that
was
quoted
in...
in
one
of
the...
the
briefs
about
the
recent
legislation,
and
the...
the
substance
of
the
colloquy
was
we're
not
making
any
change
in
the
law,
we're
just
clarifying
it.
well,
in
fact,
if
there
is
no
textual
difference
for
tax
purposes
between
the
law,
so
far
as
it
concerns
these...
these
so-called
discrimination
recoveries
and
non-discrimination
recoveries
that
have
the
same
problem
that
justice
o'connor
is
talking
about,
shouldn't
we
infer
that
at
least
the
senate
of
the
united
states
assumes
that
this
does
not
get
into
gross?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm...
i'm
talking
about
the
colloquy.
i'm
talking
about
the
colloquy.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
on...
on
that
theory,
that
there
is
a
non-tax
economic
purpose,
do
you
still
maintain
that
your
theory
should
have
as
an
element
unrelated
people?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
we
need
the
question
of
the
relationship,
which
justice
stevens's
questions
raised,
even
to
arise
if...
if
the
principal
criterion
is
going
to
be
economic
non-tax
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't...
aren't
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if...
if
you
view
it
as
the
theft
loss,
you...
you
maintain
your
theory.
if
you
argue,
as
you
were
arguing
a
second
ago,
i
think
what,
in
fact,
you're
doing
is
adopting
the
mere
lien
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you
better
go
with
justice
ginsburg.
