now,
if...
if
this
didn't
involve
the
alternative
minimum
tax,
would
the
amount
be
deductible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
some
states
such
as
oregon
require
a
plaintiff
to
remit
a
portion
of
punitive
damages
recovered
to
the
state
so
they
don't
even
go
to
the
taxpayer?
but
is
the
taxpayer
saddled
with
that
too?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
attorney's
fees
in
class
actions?
as
i
understand
it,
those
are
not
regarded
by
the
government
as
attributable
all
to
the
taxpayer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
plaintiff
who's
part
of
a
class
in
a
class
action
suit
where
attorney's
fees
are
paid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i
thought
we
were...
our
attention
was
pointed
to
a
number
of
instances
where
the
internal
revenue
service
did
not
require
the
taxpayer
to
show
all
the
attorney's
fees
as
income
in
those
class
action
situations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let...
let
me
ask
you
about
professor
davenport's
theory.
he
filed
a...
an
amicus
brief
here
saying
that
the
contingency
fee
or
the
attorney's
fees
should
be
capitalized
as
a
transaction
cost
increasing
the
basis
of
the
property
which
was
the
claim
in
the
lawsuit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
i
don't
either.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
does
that
happen?
you
haven't
the
question.
are
there
instances
where
plaintiffs
in
lawsuits
end
up
receiving
tax
bills,
as
a
result
of
this
scheme,
for
more
money
than
they
received
in
the
lawsuit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
fifth
amendment
takings
clause
apply
to
a
government
tax
scheme
that
taxes
something
beyond
the
income
received?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
the
point
where
the
government
charges
more
than
the
taxpayer
received--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
income?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
this
is
an
appalling
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
move
on
to
something
else
because
i
have
a
couple--
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
make
of
professor
davenport's
proposal
to
capitalize
the
contingency
fee
as
a
transaction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
an
opinion
to
announce
in
two
consolidated
cases
in
numbers
03-892
and
03-907,
commission
of
internal
revenue
versus
banks,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
versus
banaitis.
they
are
authored
by
justice
kennedy.
these
consolidated
cases
require
us
to
interpret
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
respondent
taxpayers
were
plaintiffs
and
civil
suits
where
the
sums
recovered
must
be
treated
as
income.
part
of
each
plaintiff’s
recovery
was
paid
to
his
attorney
pursuant
to
a
contingent
fee
arrangement.
the
question
is
whether
for
purposes
of
determining
the
taxpayer’s
gross
income.
the
whole
amount
of
the
recovery
must
be
deemed
income
to
the
taxpayer
or
on
the
other
hand
whether
the
moneys
paid
to
the
attorneys
are
excluded
from
the
taxpayer’s
gross
income.
the
resolution
of
this
question
is
important
because
for
the
years
in
question
the
alternative
minimum
tax
prevented
the
taxpayer’s
from
deducting
their
legal
expenses.
the
government
maintains
that
under
settle
tax
principles
the
whole
of
the
litigation
recovery
including
the
portion
paid
to
the
attorney
must
be
counted
as
income
to
the
taxpayer.
in
an
opinion
to
the
court
filed
today
written
by
justice
kennedy,
we
agree
with
the
position
of
the
government.
we
have
long
held
that
the
taxpayer
cannot
exclude
an
economic
gain
from
gross
income
by
assigning
the
gain
in
advance
to
another
party
even
if
the
taxpayer
does
not
actually
received
the
income,
the
incomes
is
attributed
to
the
taxpayer
if
he
or
she
retains
dominion
over
the
income
generating
asset.
in
the
case
of
a
litigation
recovery,
the
income
generating
asset
is
the
cause
of
action
that
derives
from
the
plaintiff’s
legal
injury.
the
plaintiff
retains
dominion
over
this
asset
throughout
the
litigation,
although
the
attorney
contributes
a
skill
and
effort
to
their
recovery,
the
attorney-client
relationship
remains
a
principal
agent
relationship
not
a
business
partnership
or
joint
venture.
the
client
retains
ultimate
control
over
critical
decisions
such
as
to
whether
to
settle
the
litigation.
even
where
the
attorney
exercises
independent
judgment
on
tactical
decisions,
the
attorney
remains
an
agent
who
is
duty-bound
to
act
for
the
exclusive
benefit
of
the
client.
the
fact
that
the
attorney
is
the
client’s
agent
means
it
is
appropriate
to
treat
the
full
amount
of
any
recovery
as
income
to
the
client.
the
rule
applies
whether
or
not
the
contingent
fee
contract
or
state
law
confers
any
special
rights
or
protections
on
the
attorney
so
long
as
those
protections
do
not
alter
the
fundamental
principal
agent
character
of
the
relationship.
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
and
the
ninth
circuits
are
reversed.
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
the
chief
justice
did
not
participate
in
the
decision
of
these
cases.
