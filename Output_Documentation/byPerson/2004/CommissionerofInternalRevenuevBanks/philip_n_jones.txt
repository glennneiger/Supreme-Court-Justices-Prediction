mr.
philip
n.
jones
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client
and
i
are
asking
the
court
to
rule
that
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine
does
not
apply
when
unrelated
persons
combine
their
resources
to
jointly
generate
income.
and
we--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--you
mentioned
the...
the
management
agent
and
the...
i
think
you
mentioned
the
talent
agent,
and
there
was
also
mentioned
the
literary
agent.
the...
the
author
is
in
the
trade
or
business
and
gets
to
deduct
all
this
off
the
top.
there's
no
problem
there.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
yes.
the
literary
agent--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--yes.
the
literary
agent
is
in
a
trade
or
business.
that's
off
the
top.
that's
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
deduction
on
schedule
c.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
yes.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
yes.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
our
first
choice,
our
preference
for
this
court
to
rule
is...
is
not
the
partnership
or
joint
venture
theory.
our
first
choice
is
for
this
court
to
simply
look
at
the
application
of
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine
and
ask
it...
if
it
is
being
misapplied.
the...
the
petitioner
has
not
cited
to
the
court
a
single,
solitary
case
in
which
unrelated
persons
combine
their
resources
to
jointly
produce
income,
and
that
is
the
rule
of
law
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
today.
that
is
apart
and
separate
from
the
partnership
theory,
that
two
unrelated
persons
who
join
together
to
produce
income--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--yes.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
well,
the--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i
would
like
to--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
three
avenues
to
reach
this
result
that
i
have
just
suggested
and
the
partnership/joint
venture
theory
is
only
one
of
those.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
okay.
i
will
move
on
to
that,
and
i
will
not
mention
that
again.
[laughter]
this
court
created
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine.
congress
did
not
create
it.
this
court
has
every
right
and
power
to
limit
its...
its
definition,
to
limit
its
scope
to
keep
it
from
being
misapplied.
in
every
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
we
have
a...
a
family
situation,
related
people
making
gifts
to
each
other
with
no
commercial
purpose.
apart
from
the
partnership
and
joint
venture
theory,
if
we
simply
say
that
this
case
is
dramatically
outside
of
the
scope
of
that
doctrine,
of
good
doctrine
that
has
been
applied
properly
in
an
inter-family
situation,
but
when
you
have
two
unrelated
persons
joining
forces
to
produce
income--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--this
court
has
a
long
history
of
recognizing--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--of
recognizing
sham
transactions.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
all
right.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
gratuitous
nature
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
and
the
non-gratuitous
aspects
of
our
case.
let's
talk
about
a
person
injury
case
where
this
problem
does
not
arise
because
there's
no
tax
involved.
this
relationship
of
a
contingent
fee
is
entered
into
thousands
of
times
every
week
by
people
injured
in
automobile
accidents.
they
are
not
entering
into
this
contingent
fee
agreement
for
tax
purposes.
they're
not
trying
to
avoid
tax...
taxes.
the
commissioner
is
confusing
intent
with--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i
agree
completely.
i
was
trying
to
emphasize
the...
the
intrafamily
gratuitous
nature
of
those
cases,
but
i
agree--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--yes.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
but
we
must--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i'm
asking
the
court
to
skip
over
motive
and
look
at
result.
the
court
in
that
case
was
attacking
a
result
because
that
arrangement
stayed
in
place
after
the
income
tax
was...
was
enacted.
the
solicitor
general
is
confusing
intent
with
result.
in
every
case,
in
every
single
case,
without
exception,
this
doctrine
has
been
applied
to
the
result.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
it
would
produce
a
different
result.
the
commissioner's
case
is
based
on
could
have.
they
say
they
could
have
tried
the
case
himself.
he
couldn't.
but...
but
the
main
thing
he--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--well,
he--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--we
treat
them
differently
simply
because
he
didn't.
i
practice
law
in
a
partnership.
i'm
taxed
accordingly.
i
could...
i
could
be...
set
up
my
arrangement
different
ways
and
the
tax
results
would
be
different.
we
must
honor
these
relationships--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i...
i
have
difficulty
with
that
question.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
my...
i
believe
that
attorneys
don't
allow
themselves
to
be
placed
in
that
position.
they
get
the
contingent
fee
agreement
signed
when
the...
the--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--but
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question.
i...
i
don't
know
that.
but
an...
we...
the
internal
revenue
code
respects
people
who
enter
into
corporations,
who
enter
into
joint
ventures,
who
enter
into
sole
proprietorships,
who
hire
employees
or
allow
themselves
to
be
hired
by
others.
those
relationships
are
all
respected
and
honored
by
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
the
commissioner
is
asking
you
to
dishonor
this
relationship
because
mr.
banaitis
could
have
handled
the
case
himself
or
could--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i
believe
the
problem
is
that
a
plaintiff
has...
i
wish
i
could
say
this
plaintiff
is
in...
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
can
deduct
it
or
trade
or...
as
a
trade
or
business
expense.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
i
understand.
but
one
of
the...
the
odd
result
here
of
a
person
having
to
pay
more
in
taxes
than
they
recover...
this
actually
comes
up
under
a
fee
shifting
statute
that
applies
to
the
internal
revenue
service
where
a
person
could
be
in
litigation
with
the
internal
revenue
service,
the
internal
revenue
service
becomes
obligated
to
pay
fees
because
they
acted
unreasonably.
they
pay
those
fees,
and
then
they
simultaneously
hand
the
taxpayer
a
bill
for
taxes
on
those
fees.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
no.
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine
does
not
apply.
those
relationships
are
all
governed
by
existing
law
and
there
is
a
large
body
of
law
dealing
with
those
cases
and
they
can
be
found
in
a
cite
that
is
offered
by
the
petitioner
at
page
3
of
his
reply
brief.
it
talks
about
the
literary
agents.
it
talks
about
the...
the
management
agents.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
i...
i
am
not
trying
to
avoid
your
question,
but
i'm
trying
to
clarify
that
i
am
not
asking
this
court
to
determine
who
has
the
income
in
those
cases
because
there
is
a
large
body
of
law
and
a
large
body
of
statutory
law
that
answers
the
questions
for
each
of
those
examples.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
we
do
not
get
to
those
answers.
we
should
not
get
to
those
answers
through
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
the
oregon
question,
your
honor,
which
i
don't
think
the
court
is
likely
interested
in--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--the...
the
oregon
question.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
the
oregon
question.
that
is--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--the
oregon
question
is
part
iv
of
our
brief
beginning
on
page
31
which
would
not
be
a
national
uniform
rule.
but
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
simply,
as
narrowly
as
possible,
to
limit
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine
and
do
nothing
more
than
that.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
i
believe
professor
davenport
is
completely
correct.
i
support
his
theory
wholeheartedly.
we
didn't
make
that
argument
because
we
believe
the
limitation
on
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine
is
the
real
issue
and
we
believe
that
is
the
narrower
issue.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
yes.
well,
i...
i
think
so.
mr.
philip
n.
jones
i...
i'm
sorry.
i
think
i
misspoke.
i'm
not
sure
that's
his
theory.
i'm
not
certain,
and
i'm--
mr.
philip
n.
jones
--i
would
like
to
make
one
additional
point
in
the
few
seconds
i
have
left.
the...
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
that
the
language,
the
statutory
language,
of
the
new
statute
implies
a
particular
result.
this
court
decided
as
early
as
1940
in
the
higgins
v.
smith
case
when
the
commissioner
made
the
exact
same
argument,
and
this
court
said...
and
i
quote...
that
does
not
follow.
the
statutory
language
says
that
to
the
extent
this
income
is...
this...
this
money
is
included
in
income,
to
the
extent
it
is
included
in
income...
it
doesn't
say
whether
it
is
or
not...
then
a
deduction
will
be
allowed.
and
that
as
neutral
a
statement
as
i
can
think
of.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
language
that
implies
one
answer
or
the
other.
but
i
emphasize
to
the
court
that
the...
the
commissioner
is
confusing
intent
with
result
when
he
discusses
the
cases
upon
which
he
is
relying.
those
cases
reached
a
result
and
they
corrected
that
result.
we
don't
have
an
abuse
in
this
situation.
and
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine
should
not
be
stretched
beyond
its
bounds
by
this
court.
it
should
be
limited
to
its
historical
use.
this
is
a
misuse.
thank
you
very
much.
