we'll
hear
argument
in
two
cases,
the
commissioner
of
revenue...
internal
revenue
against
banks
and
the
commissioner
against
banaitis.
mr.
salmons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
have
a
different
result
if
they
were
related?
supposing
the
lawyer
is
a
cousin
of
the
client.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
a
good
friend.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
not
a
sham
transaction.
you
just
happen
to
be
related.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
what
if
you
had
the
same
result
but...
in
terms
of
the
sharing
of
the
expense
and
the
recovery,
but
it
was
computed
on
an
hourly
basis
rather
than
a
percentage
basis?
would
that
produce
a
different
result?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
he
could
have
made...
i'm
saying
he
could
have
said
to
the
lawyer,
i'll
pay
you
30...
a...
a
third
of
the
recovery
or
i'll
pay
you
$100
an
hour.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
come
out
exactly
the
same
result,
but
you...
but
do
you
treat
them
differently
or
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
i
ask
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
hypothetical?
supposing
that
the
agreement
on
the
contingency
is
postponed
until
the
middle
of
the
preparation,
not
made
at
the
outset,
but
along
the
line,
they
say
we'll
figure
out
what
a
fair
percentage
will
be,
and
when
the
recovery
comes
in,
they
then
decide,
okay,
you
take
a
third.
what...
what
result
do
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
sure
it
arises
fairly
often.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
did
very
often.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
carty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
carty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
salmons,
you
have
a
little
over
2
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
salmons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
submitted.
