mr.
james
r.
carty
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
neither
section
61(a)
nor
any
other
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
expressly
requires
that
a
federal
civil
rights
litigant,
such
as
mr.
banks,
include
in
his
gross
income
the
portion
of
a
litigation
recovery
that
was
earned
by,
retained
by,
and
already
taxed
to
his
attorney
as
a
contingent
fee.
the
commissioner's
position
in
this
case
relies
exclusively
on
the
misapplication
of
a
judicial
doctrine
known
as
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine.
that
doctrine
originated
and
developed
as
a
judicial
anti-abuse
rule,
designed
to
prevent
high-bracket
taxpayers--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--i
respectfully--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--justice--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--justice
scalia,
i
respectfully
disagree.
it
is
true,
as
the
commissioner
and
you
point
out,
that
at
the
time
of
the
agreement
between
the
husband
and
wife,
the
income
tax
was
not
in
existence.
however,
the
agreement
certainly
was
in
existence
after
the
income
tax
was
passed.
so
that
could
have
been
a
reason
why
the
agreement
was
never
rescinded.
in
addition,
in
another
landmark
case
from
1937,
blair,
this
court
expressly
looked
to
whether
there
was
a
tax
avoidance
motive.
and
this
is
how
this
principle
is
taught
in
first-year
tax
class.
that's
the
whole
purpose
behind
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commissioner
in
a...
in
a
different
context
actually
looked
to
the
fact,
with
respect
to
a
particular
transaction,
whether
there
was
as
tax
avoidance
purpose.
mr.
james
r.
carty
well,
certainly
the
attorney
has
a
legal
right
to
those
funds.
he
has
a
contractual
right
and
under
most--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--well,
at...
at
that
point
the
income
wouldn't
have
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
attorney.
mr.
james
r.
carty
justice
kennedy,
i...
i
think
the--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--i
believe
that
for
tax
purposes
the
attorney's
right
to
the
funds...
that's
at
the
moment
he
receives
it.
so
if
he
doesn't
have
the
funds
in
hand,
he
wouldn't
be
liable
for
federal
tax.
it
would
be
at
the
point
he
either
receives
the
funds--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--i...
i
think
that
is
an
alternative
way
to...
to
view
it.
there
would
be
a--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--justice
souter,
i...
i--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
carty
justice--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--it
would
not
be
in
the
case
that
the
funds
are
not
under
the
control
of
the
attorney.
mr.
james
r.
carty
i
thought
your
hypothetical--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--i
would
state,
your
honor,
that
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine
simply
does
not
apply
when
the...
the
client
has
no
control
or
power
of
disposition
over
the
income
that
was
subject
to
the
assignment.
there
are
at
least
five
reasons
why
this
type
of
contract--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--justice
breyer,
i...
i
think
it's
helpful
to
make
a
conceptual
distinction
between
the
claim,
the
underlying
litigation
claim,
and
the
right
to
receive
the
funds.
now,
certainly
mr.
banks
in
this
case
had
a
right
to
enter
into
settlement
or
not.
he
had
a
right
to
fire
his
attorney.
but
once
he
assigned
the
contingent
fee
portion
of
the
recovery,
he,
as
a
practical
matter,
had
no
ability,
he
had
no
control
over
that
portion
of
the
recovery.
another
fundamental
difference
between--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--we
submit,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
nature
of
the
attorney-client
relationship
is
fundamentally
different
from
the
types
of
relationships
you
cited,
and
that's
because
an
attorney
here
is
the
one
who's
earning
the
income.
it's
the
attorney
who
is
making
the
critical
decisions.
mr.
james
r.
carty
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
i...
i
think
there's
a...
there's
a
fundamental
difference.
presumably
a...
a
actor
or
an
entertainer...
their...
their
market
value
is...
already
has
some
type
of
tangible
value.
the...
the
agent
might--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--again,
your
honor,
i
think
with
respect
to
an
entertainer,
an
entertainer
necessarily
doesn't
need
an
agent.
neither
does
an
athlete.
mr.
james
r.
carty
i...
i
think
that
might
be
more
similar
to
the
attorney-client
relationship.
but
mr.
banks,
unlike
the
athlete
or
unlike
the
entertainer,
had
no...
no
ability
to...
to
recover
these
funds
himself.
he
essentially
had
two
options.
he
could
have
either
done
nothing
and
collected
nothing--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
carty
right.
mr.
james
r.
carty
well,
your
honor--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--again,
i...
what
we're
saying
is
the
unique
situation
of
an
attorney
and
a
client,
it
is
the
attorney
who's
taking
the
laboring,
or
unlike
the
entertainer
example
where
the...
where...
or
the
athlete
example--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
lucas
v.
earl,
it
was
the
assignor
who
earned
the
income
that
was
subject
to
disposition.
here--
mr.
james
r.
carty
--that
is
an
excellent
point,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
carty
nevertheless...
nevertheless,
i...
i
think
there
may
be
some...
some
difference
in
degree
that
you
might
even
recognize
between
the
two
cases.
another
issue
i'd
like
to
address
is
the
impact
of
the
fee
shifting
statutes,
if
i
could
get
to
that
quickly.
it
is
a
bedrock
principle
of
taxation
that
settlements
of
a
claim
are
taxed
the
same
as
a
judgment
would
have
been
taxed.
mr.
banks'
settlement
was
achieved
in
lieu
of
his
claims
under
title
vii
and
42
u.s.c.,
sections
1981
and
1983.
now,
each
of
these
statutes
contains
a
fee
shifting
provision
which
enables
a
court
to
award
attorney's
fees
to
a
prevailing
plaintiff.
the
defendant
in
mr.
banks'
case,
the
california
department
of
education...
they
therefore
settled
mr.
banks'
claim
in
lieu
of
their
exposure
under
these
fee
shifting
statutes.
an
award
pursuant
to
these
fee
shifting
statutes
is
separate
and
distinct
from
a
damages
recovery
and
therefore
should
not
be
taxable
to
a
plaintiff.
and
the
federal
tax
consequences
to
mr.
banks,
the
litigant
who
settles,
shouldn't
be
any
different
as
well.
otherwise,
this
court
would
be
discouraging
settlement.
therefore,
a
judicial
anti-abuse
rule
should
not
be
misused
to
undermine
the
statutory
scheme
devised
by
congress
to
encourage
civil
rights
litigants
to
bring
meritorious
claims
and
vindicate
national
policy.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions?
mr.
james
r.
carty
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
banks
settled
his
claims.
yet,
we
are
pressing
the
point
that
mr.
banks
shouldn't
be
treated
any
differently
for
tax
purposes
than
a
litigant
who
recovers
pursuant
to
a
fee
shifting
statute.
otherwise,
the
court
would
be
discouraging
settlement.
if
there's
any
other
questions.
mr.
james
r.
carty
thank
you.
