justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
argument...
you...
you
said
at
the
outset
that
it
has
to
be
an
itemized
deduction
subject
to
the
2
percent
rule
even
if
we
set
aside
the
alternative
minimum
tax.
is
that
conceded
by
everyone,
or
does
somebody...
do
some
people
say
this
is
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expense?
i
know
it's
not
your
business,
but
it
seems
to
me
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expense
to
recover
the...
the...
for
employment
discrimination,
which
is
really
part
of
your
work.
i
don't
know
why...
is
it...
does
everybody
agree
that
this
is
subject
to
the
2
percent
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
can't
get
out
of
my
mind
in
this
case
that
the
mechanics
of
the
particular
case
may
control.
i
know
we
need
a
national
rule
and
so
forth.
my
recollection
is
that
in
some
states
when
there
is
a
settlement
or
a
judgment
paid
under
a
case
where
there's
a
contingency
fee
contract,
the
check
is
made
out
both
to
the
attorney
and
to
the
client
and
is
put
in
the
attorney's
client's
trust
account.
so
the
client
never
has
control
over
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
that's
true
in
most
of
the
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
a
very
real...
in...
in
a
very
real
sense,
in
a...
in
the
legal
sense,
the
client
just
doesn't
have
control.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he...
he
did
or
he
didn't,
but
there
was
no
money
there.
there
was
nothing
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other...
other
than
the
mercy
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
doesn't...
doesn't
that
indicate--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--something
basically
flawed
about
your
whole
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
not
income
in
any...
in
any
real
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
so
what...
what
about
the
talent
scout
who
tells
the
celebrity
that
he'll
take
10
percent
of
the
celebrity's
movie
proceeds
or
the
management
search
person
that's
going
to
take
a...
a
third
of
the
executive's
pay
for
the
first
6
months?
where...
are
all...
all
these
cases
ones
in
which
there...
there's
no
income
to
the...
to
the
principal,
we'll
call
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
probably
what's...
what's
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
the
reason
this
is
income
is
it
relates
to
employment.
and
i
don't
see
why
hiring
the
attorney
to
get
that
income
is
not
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense
under
what
used
to
be
section
162.
that
may
be
part
of
the
problem.
do
you
agree
that
it's
not
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
suppose
that's
the
reason...
that's
the
reason
why
it's
taxable
to
begin
with,
is
it
relates
to
employment.
if
i
hire
an
attorney
because
i'm
wrongfully
discharged
and
i
get...
i
get
my
job
back,
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expense.
that...
that's
why...
one
of
the
reasons
i
have
problems
with
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
get...
get
to
a
different
point.
it...
it
does
seem
to
me
that
we...
we
have
to
be
very
careful
in
this
case
not
to
distort
the
revenue
law
for
other
transactions
that
are
not
before
the
court.
and
the...
the
natural
extension
of...
of
your
position
is
that
anytime
when
the
taxpayer
enters
into
an
agreement
with
an
agent
to
pay
the
agents
an
amount
contingent
on
the
success
of
the
venture,
that
it's
not
income,
that...
that
the...
that
the
payment
is
not
income
to
the
principal.
and
i
just
can't
accept
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what's
the
difference
in
principle.
i
don't
understand
the
difference
in
principle
when
we're
talking
about
who
has
the
income.
it's
the
first
thing
you
ask
in...
in
a
first-year...
in...
in
your...
in
your
first
class
in
tax.
where
is
the
income?
who
gets
the
income?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under...
under
your
view--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose
that
the
attorney
is...
is
waiting
for
payment
of...
of
his,
say,
one-third
contingency,
and
the
client
just
absconds
with
the
money.
how
is...
what...
what
happens
from
a
tax
standpoint
under
your
theory?
i
take
it
the
attorney
has
to
declare
the
income
on
his
return
and
then
declare
a
loss?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
you
about
the
tax
consequences.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i...
i
thought
under
your
view
the
moment
the
client
gets
the
check
for
the
full
amount,
one-third
of
it
is
taxable
to
the
attorney.
and
i
have
some
problems,
incidentally,
with
respect
to
tax
years
if
it...
if
you...
if
the
client
receives
the
check
december
30
and
is
on
vacation
and
doesn't
get
around
to
remitting
to
the
attorney
until
january
5th,
i'm...
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
your
theory
works,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
on
the
absconding
theory,
how...
how
is
it
handled
from
a
tax
standpoint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that
would
be
the
same
with
the
theater
agent
or
the
commission
agent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
for
the
talent
scout.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
client,
in
effect,
earned
the
money
by
having
this...
undergo
this...
this
discrimination.
that...
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
is
not
the
plumber
hypothetical,
which
is
i
think
quite
misleading.
no.
no,
i
don't
think
that
even
the
government
will
defend
that.
