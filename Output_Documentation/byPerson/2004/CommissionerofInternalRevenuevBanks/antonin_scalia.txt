justice
antonin
scalia
that's
of
annual
income.
right?
2
percent
of...
of
the
person's
annual
income?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
gee,
in
the
case
of
a...
of
a
major
award,
that
2
percent
is
very
likely
to
be
exceeded,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
a
problem
that's
going
to
exist
even...
even
after
the
alternate
minimum
tax
is
abolished.
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
think...
the
government
doesn't
think
it's
a
problem.
i'm
talking
about
taking
a
huge
percentage
of
the...
of
the
person's
recovery.
that...
that
will
happen
even...
even
in
the
case
where
there's
no
minimum
tax...
alternative.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose
the
same
amount
were
paid,
as
was
paid
here,
to
the
attorney,
but
it
was
not
by
way
of
a
contingent
fee,
that
the...
the
client
had
committed
to
pay
this
dollar
amount
in
a
dollar
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
flat
fee.
what...
what
would
the
tax
treatment
of
that
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you...
you
don't
need
a
transfer
of
the...
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
transfer
of
the...
the
cause
of
action.
certainly
if
you
buy
a
piece
of
real
estate
and...
and
there's
lawyer's
business
connected
with
it,
you...
you
don't...
you
don't
take
an
ordinary
deduction
which
is
subject
to
the
alternative
minimum
tax
for
those
lawyer's
fees.
you
just
say
that's
part
of
the
transaction,
and
it
goes
onto
the
basis
of
your
property.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't...
why
isn't
that
very
similar
to
this?
i
mean,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
there's
a...
there's
a
transaction
here,
isn't
there?
isn't
there
a
transaction?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
a...
the
service
is
connected
to
a
transaction,
namely
the
conversion
of
the
chosen
action
into
a
money
payment.
you
have
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
unformed
chosen
action.
you're
entitled
to
it,
but
there's
a
transaction
converting
it
into
a
money
payment.
now,
why
shouldn't
you
attribute
to
that
transaction
all...
which
is
profitable
to
you,
all
of
the
costs
that
go
along
with
the
transaction?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
problem
that
occurs
to
me.
i
don't
know
where
you
draw
the
line.
and
you
say
you
can't
draw
a
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're...
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i...
can
i
ask
you
a
question
relating
to
the
davenport...
what's
been
referred
to
as
the
davenport
theory?
i
had
thought
that...
that
the
service
has
used
the...
the
transaction
theory
with
regard
to
legal
fees
payable
for
a
lawsuit
seeking
increased
compensation
for
the
condemnation
of
real
estate
where
the
taxpayer
had
objected
to
the
amount
that
the
condemning
entity
was
offering
and
brought
suit
in
court
and
with
a
contingent
fee
to
the
lawyer
and
that
the
service
treated
that
as...
as
part
of
the
transaction
cost.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
my
recollection
is
wrong.
i'll
look
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
salmons,
i...
i...
you've
cited
the...
the
baylin
case
to
me
and
i...
i've
looked
at
the
description
of
it
in
the
brief,
which
i
had
recalled,
and
what
it
says
is
that
it
did,
indeed,
involve
a
taking
by
the
state,
and
when
the
state
didn't
offer
what
baylin
thought
was...
was
enough,
he
went
to
court,
he
prevailed,
and
recovered
a
much
larger
sum
than
the
state
had
offered
him.
his
legal
fees
were,
by
the
irs,
subtracted
from
the
award,
and
he
was
taxed
only
upon
the
proceeds
reduced
by
the
legal
fees.
now,
how
do
you
explain
that
situation
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
does
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
doubt...
i
doubt
whether
professor
davenport
has
misdescribed
the
case
in...
in
his
brief,
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
don't
really
know
who
prepared
that
colloquy
anyway,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
have
been
prepared
by
the
respondents
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
partnership
theory
when
you
talk
about
two
persons
joining
together.
i
don't
like
this...
this
gold
mine
view
of
litigation,
that
it's,
you
know,
like
two
prospectors.
you
know,
there's
money
to
be
obtained.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
that's...
that's
not
what
i
view
of
a
chosen
action
as.
i
view
it
as
a
legal
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
person
is
entitled
to
money,
and
ultimately
the
amount
he's
entitled
to
is
determined
by
the
litigation.
and
i'm
not
about
to
adopt
a...
a
legal
theory
that...
that
views
this
as
a...
as
a
search
for
buried
treasure--
[laughter]
--in...
in
which
the...
the
lawyer
and
the
person
who
has
been
wronged
are...
are
simply
co-prospectors.
i...
i
just
think
that
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
that's
how
you
view
the...
the
enterprise--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
don't
think
the
law
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
avoidance
motive
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--granddaddy
of
all
cases.
the
assignment
there,
although
it
was
between
family
members,
had
been
made
before
there
was
an
income
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
income
tax
didn't
exist.
there...
there
couldn't
conceivably
have
been
an
avoidance
motive.
so...
so
our
holding
could
hardly
be
based
upon...
upon
the
existence
of
an
avoidance
motive.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
who?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
oregon
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
oregon
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it's
not
his
theory.
he...
he
thinks
it's...
it's
attached
to
transactions,
and...
and
much
of
his
argument
is
devoted
to
showing
that
capital
transactions
are
no
different
from
other
transactions
as
far
as
the
internal
revenue
code's
desire
to
match
the...
the
gain
with
the
expenses
concerned.
and
that's
the
part
of
his
theory
that
i'm
not
so
sure
about
because
aside
from
the...
aside
from
the
condemnation
case
that
i
mentioned,
i...
i
don't
know
of
any
other
cases
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
has
treated
transaction
costs
the
way
he
would
have
it
done.
maybe
it
makes
sense,
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
originated
in
a
case
where
there
could
not
possibly
have
been
an...
an
intent
to
abuse
because
the...
the
transfer
had
occurred
before
there
was
any
income
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
just...
just
don't...
maybe
you
think
that
that's
what
it
ought
to
be,
but...
but
please
don't
tell
us
that
that
is
how
it
originated.
it
plainly
did
not
originate
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
argument.
i'm...
i'm
just
quarreling
over
whether
it
originated
that
way.
if
you
want
to
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
agree
with
that.
you
should--
[laughter]
