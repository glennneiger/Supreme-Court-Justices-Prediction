justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
class
action
distinction
that
the
commissioner
had
was
between
opt
in
and
opt
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
opt
in,
then
you
did
exercise
control.
so
all
the
money
is
yours.
but
if
you
opt
out,
you
didn't
have
control
over
the
suit
because
you
didn't
opt
out.
i
mean,
you
just
were
lethargic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
basic
thing.
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
the
principle
is
for
the
reason
that
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
reconcile
the
commissioner's
view
in
the
class
action
case
with
the
punitive
damage
case
because
there
the
person
has
control
over
the
lawsuit.
so
why
doesn't
all
the
punitive
damage,
attorney's
fees
that
come
out
of
that,
and
so
forth
belong
to...
in
other
words,
it
sounds
to
me,
as
i
read
this,
something
of
a
mess,
and
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
clear
principle
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
can...
can
i
ask
you
to
go
back
for
a
minute?
i
guess
the
irs...
you're
seeing
the
lawsuit
as
the
income-generating
asset.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
looking
at
the
control
of
the
plaintiff,
for
example,
over
the
lawsuit
as
something
that
determines
whether
it's
his
income.
and
he,
of
course,
can't
give
away
his
income.
but
on
that
theory,
to
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
original
question,
then
the
punitive
damages
also
must
be
his
income
because
he
has
equal
control
over
them
and
they
grow
out
of
the
income-producing
asset.
and
that,
of
course,
is
what's
bothering
me
because
it
seems
to
me
that
your
theory,
which
is
a
well-established
theory,
coupled
with
a
congress
that
seems
to
be
willing
to
take
away
deductions
for
expenses
that
lead
to
the
income,
could
produce
an
income
tax
that
in
many
cases,
not
just
a
few,
exceeds
the
income
that
an
individual
has.
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
in
the
law
is
there
to
guard
against
that
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
constitutional
protection?
the
sixteenth
amendment
refers
to
an
income
tax,
and
perhaps
that
doesn't
include
a
tax
that
grossly
exceeds
in
many
cases
a
person's
income.
that
would
be
quite
a
far-out
theory
at
the
moment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i...
that's
why
i
ask
you.
is
there
any
protection
in
the
law
whatsoever?
or
if
congress
decides
to
tax
a
set
of
people
who,
let's
see...
say,
earn
$10,000
a
year
and
because
they're
small
business
people,
they
happen
to
have
$20,000
expenses.
so
it
taxes
them
on
$20,000,
and
the
tax
exceeds
the
income.
there's
no
protection
in
your
view
against
that
result.
and
you
just
said,
well,
congress
decided
to
do
it,
it
decided
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
an
assumption,
for
example,
that
when
we
read
the
code,
we
read
it
with
a
view
towards
thinking
congress
did
not
want
to
produce
such
unfair
results?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
isn't
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the
problem
is
you're...
you're
trying
to
get
a
theory
in
response
to
him
that
i
think
justice
kennedy
is
asking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
theory,
which
is
the
problem
for
your
side
of
the
case...
that
theory
has
all
kinds
of
implications.
i
go
out
and
i
help
the
painter
paint
my
office.
we
have
a
joint
venture.
i...
so
there's
no
problem.
i
don't
take
it
in...
you
know,
i
get
a...
this
is
great.
and
so
that
i
think,
if
i'm
right,
was
the
thrust
of
justice
kennedy's
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
third?
i
just
don't
want
you
to
miss
your
third.
you
have
the
joint
venture
theory,
an
exception
to
an
assignment
in
income,
and
you
said
you
had
a
third.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
took
a
settlement...
his
theory,
i
take
it,
was
seeing
the
lawsuit
as
a
capital
asset.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
whenever
you
settled
a
lawsuit,
it
would
be...
you'd
have
to
pay
capital
gains
instead
of
ordinary
income.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
somebody
stealing
a
check
out
of
my
mailbox
from
my
employer.
right?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your
theory,
i
mean,
precisely?
a,
an
assignment
of
income,
what
would
otherwise
count
of
a
giving
an
assignment
of
income
to
b,
and
therefore
still
be
a's
income
because
the
asset
remains
with
a,
the
work,
or
whatever.
now,
your
theory
is
but
not
in
the
case
that.
now
fill
in
the
blank
for
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
precisely,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
in
the
case...
it
is
an
assignment
of
income
to
b,
but
not
in
the
case
where
the
funds
are
not
in...
when
b...
when
b
get...
when
b,
the
attorney,
gets
the
funds,
he
controls
them.
what's...
what
do
you
mean?
i
don't
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know.
you
have
three...
your
problem
on
your
side
for
me
is
that
maybe
all
the
equities
are
there,
but
i'd
like
to
know
the
proposition
of
law
that
you
want
us
to
write
in
this
opinion.
and
now
we
had
three
theories,
and
one,
the
one
that
you
seem
to
be
adopting,
is
this
exception
to
the
assignment
of
income
doctrine.
if
that
is
what
you're
adopting,
i'd
like
to
know
the
precise
form
of
words
that
create
the
exception.
if
that's
not
the
theory
you're
adopting,
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
theory
you're
adopting
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
did
have
control.
he
could
have
settled
the
lawsuit
or
not
settled
the
lawsuit.
he
controlled
when
the
income
was
generated,
and
moreover,
he
could
have
stopped
it
from
being
generated
by
settling
the
suit
or
dismissing
it.
moreover,
if
he
had
not
entered
into
this
assignment
of
income,
it
would
have
been
paid
right
into
his
bank
account
at
the
end.
it
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
the
lucases
or
like
the
horsts
or
whoever,
old
colony
trust.
it
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
those
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your...
your...
you
want
to
fill
in
the
blank,
in
other
words,
and
say
where
the
assignment
of
income
is
such,
such
that
b
was
in
effect
the
person
who
really
earned
the
income,
unlike
mrs.
lucas'...
mr.
lucas'
or
maybe
mr.
earl...
i
don't
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--husband...
the
wife
didn't
earn
the
income.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
husband
did.
so
you
want
to
say
where
the...
and
then
your
answer,
i
guess...
don't
say
i'm
right
if
i'm
not
right,
please,
because
i'll
just
find
out
later.
[laughter]
the...
the
answer
to
the
hypothetical
about
the
agent
and
so
forth
is,
well,
so
be
it.
if
a
person
wants
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
carving
out
some
of
his
income
and
assigning
that
over
to
the
agent,
let
him.
except
for
perhaps
provisions
of
the
code
which
we
cannot
now
envisage...
i
can't
because
i'm
not
an
expert...
it
doesn't
matter
since,
after
all,
it
would
be
deductible
anyway.
is
that...
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
please,
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
i
see.
you
say
double.
both
the
income
is
earned
by
the
attorney,
and
at
that
stage
the
client
does
virtually
nothing.
so
it's
the
reverse
of
the
earls
or
the
lucases
where
the
husband
was
doing
the
work
and
the
wife
is
getting
the
income.
it
would
be
as
if
the
wife
was
doing
all
the
work
and
the
husband
just
sat
there
and
clipped
coupons
or
whatever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
those
were
less
enlightened
times.
