when
you
say
the
class
member,
do
you...
you
mean
the
named
representative.
the
class
may
include
thousands
of
people,
but
it
would
be
income
to
the
named
representative?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
then...
then
would
it
be...
would
the
income
then
go
to
each
class...
would
each
class
member
have
a
share
of
the
income?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
on
that,
that
example,
you
gave
the
book
contract
with
the
author
and
you
gave,
i
think,
the
investor.
would
this
problem
arise
in
those
cases
or
would
the
author
get
an
above-the-line
deduction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
the
author...
that
these
people
are
all
in
the
same--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even...
even
the
potential
lawyer's
fee.
i
mean,
suppose
this
client
has
a
major
dental
repair
and
he's
got
a
risk-taking
dentist,
and
he
says,
dentist,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
deal.
i
know
you
like
to
take
risks.
i
may
win
big
in
my
lawsuit,
in
which
case
you
get
everything;
and
i
may
lose,
in
which
case
you
get
nothing.
the
dentist
says,
fine,
i'll
take
it.
can
the
client
in
that
agreement
with
his
dentist
give
what
will
be
the
lawyer's
fee,
the
part
that
will
go
to
the
lawyer
under
the
contingency
fee
agreement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
he
doesn't
have...
then
he
doesn't
have
dominion
over
that
portion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happened
in
the
cases--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
were
cases...
we
don't
have
to
deal
in
hypotheticals.
there
were
cases
where
this
happened,
where
people
ended
up
liable
for
a
tax
greater
than
what
they
took
in.
what
happened
in
those
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
there
was
one
that
was
$99,000,
if
i
remember
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
private
bill?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
what
happened?
what
actually
happened
in
that
case,
do
you
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the...
that's
the
question
i
asked
mr.
salmons--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
he
gave
me
the
opposite
answer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
an
academic
question
because
he
would
have
an
offsetting
theft
loss.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
take
an
investment
advisor
and
the
client
is
not
at
all...
doesn't
know
anything
about
the
market,
and
he's
got
this
whiz-bang
advisor
who
makes
millions
for
him
that
he
never
could
have
made
on
his
own.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that
because
why
doesn't
the
theory
that...
that
applies
to
the
lawyer
equally
apply
to
the
wife?
i
mean,
she
took
care
of
everything
going
on
at
home,
and
that
enabled
him
to
go
out
there
and
make
all
that
money.
so
without
her
services,
just
like
without
the
lawyer's
services--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
government
says
on
that
branch
of
it,
well,
the
fees...
the
lodestar
fee,
that's
one
thing.
a
court
awards
it,
but
that's
quite
different
from
the
one-third/one-half
even
contingent
fee.
the
court
has
control
over
the
fee
shifting,
but
we're
not
dealing
with
any
court
award
here.
