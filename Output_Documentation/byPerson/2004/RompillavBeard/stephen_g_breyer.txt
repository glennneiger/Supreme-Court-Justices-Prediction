justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
the
document
that's
on
the
lodging
at
page
31-34?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
a
rule
that
says
you
must
consult
the
file
of
the
case
that's
being
used
by
the
prosecutor
to
produce
seriously
aggravating
circumstance,
at
least
where
that
file
is
readily
available,
and
you
must
follow
up
indications
in
that
file
that
suggest
a
significant
mitigating
defense?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that.
you're
repeating
that
point
which...
so
i
might
ask
this
question
on
this
very
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
this,
that
i
take
it
on
page
l31
is
the
record
that
existed
in
this
horrendous
rape
'74
case
with
jo,
whatever,
the
woman,
the
bartender.
and
the
prosecution
was
making
an
enormous
amount
out
of
that.
we've
just
heard
about
it.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
am
i
right
about
the
case?
have
i
got
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
this
is...
i'm
thinking
of
it
correctly,
that
this
is
the
record
in
the
case
that
the
prosecution
made
a
lot
out
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm...
i'm
back
with
justice
stevens
then
and
i
wonder
how
it's
possible
a
lawyer
wouldn't
look
at
the
record
in
that
very
case
if
only
to
see
if
the
prosecutor
is
characterizing
the
situation
accurately.
and
had
he
done
so,
he
would
have
seen
on
the
next
page,
alcohol
problems.
he
would
have
seen
a
complete
list
of
siblings,
and
he
would
have
seen,
four
pages
later,
a
one-page
list
of
criminal
behavior
with
identification
of
crimes
that
took
place
when
he
was
a
child.
that's
all
true.
now,
if
he
had
then
noticed
these
early
criminal
records
when
he
was
a
17-year-old
and
simply
gotten
the
record
in
that
one,
he
would
have
come
across
the
document
that
is
on
page
l44
and
l45
which
says,
among
other
things,
ronald
comes
from
the
notorious
rompilla
family.
and
then
there
is
a
list
of
why
they
are
called
the
notorious
rompilla
family
which
is
fairly
horrendous.
now,
i
do
not
understand
how
any
person,
getting
the
first
record,
wouldn't
have
been
led
to
the
second,
and
i
do
not
understand
how
any
person
who
read
pages
44
and
45
of
the
second
would
not
have
thought
what
the
siblings
are
telling
me
is
wrong.
i
better
go
check
on
a
few
more
siblings
who
happen
to
have
their
names
and
addresses
here
right
in
the
pieces
of
paper
he's
looking
at.
and
he
would
then
have
discovered
this
absolutely
horrendous
background
that
judge
sloviter
mentions.
so
i
do
not
understand
why
that
one
incident,
leaving
aside
all
the
other
ones,
but
i
do
not
understand
why
that
one
failure
to
consult
the
record
that
is
being
used
by
the
prosecutor
horrendously
against
him
is
not
a
failure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
we
don't...
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
either
agree
with
justice
kennedy
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
do
agree.
all
right.
now,
if
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
my
question,
obviously,
is,
is
not
the
reason
that
you
want
to
examine
the
criminal
record
in
the
case
that
is
being
used
horrendously
against
your
client
is
to
find
out
both
as
to
what
happened
at
the
time
and
also
the
background
that
would
be
relevant
in
respect
to
your
client?
for
example,
alcohol
abuse,
which
happened
to
be
checked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
a
rap
sheet
and
so
forth
will
not
have
normally
what
this
person
is
like.
you're
dealing
with
a
client
who
has
serious
problems
of
some
kind
as
the
crimes
themselves
reveal.
they're
terrible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
and
so
i...
don't
you
think
it's
a
reasonable...
or
do
you
think
it's
a
reasonable
constitutional
requirement
to
say
that
where
cases
of
prior
history
of
the
client
are
being
used
by
the
prosecution
to
say
what
a
terrible
person
he
is...
and
he
may
be...
that
you...
the...
the
lawyer
in
a
capital
case
at
least
should
look
at
the
court
records
in
that
case
to
learn
something
about
what
this
human
being
is
like
and
why?
because
court
records,
but
not
rap
sheets
do
contain
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
serious
question
to
me
is...
is...
in
many
of
these
cases
which
we
see,
there
are
horrendous
child
abuse
histories,
and
child
abuse
is
a
terribly
difficult
thing
to
get
at
and
it's
something
that
might
not
convince
most
juries
of
anything
because
they're
all
over
the
place.
but
nonetheless,
counsel
should
have
to
make
a
reasonable
decision
about
whether
to
take
the
child
abuse
route
or
to
take
some
other
route.
and
would
it
cause
constitutional
harm,
that
is,
would
it
cause
harm
even
from
a
prosecutorial
point
of
view,
if
you
just
said,
well,
you
should
follow
up
and
look
at
records
of
prior
cases
being
used
against
you
to
see
if
you
get
a
clue
there?
