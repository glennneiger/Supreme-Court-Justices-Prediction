ms.
amy
zapp
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
address
first
the
simmons
issue
and
then
move
on
to
the
ineffectiveness
issue,
which
will
also
be
addressed
by
the
solicitor
general's
office.
the
ruling
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
this
case,
which
denied
the
petitioner
relief
under
simmons
v.
south
carolina,
was
objectively
reasonable
and
therefore
did
not
provide
a
basis
for
habeas
relief.
simmons
could
reasonably
be
understood
to
require
an
instruction
about
parole
ineligibility
only
in
situations
where
the
prosecution
had
argued
that
the
defendant
posed
a
future
danger
when
it
was
asking
the
jury
to
sentence
him
to
death.
simmons
was
a
narrow
exception
to
the
abiding
practice
of
this
court
to
allow
the
states
to
make
decisions
about
what
types
of
information
the
sentencing
jury
should
receive
with
respect
to
the
potential
for
early
release.
ms.
amy
zapp
well,
i
think
simmons
could
be
understood...
and
in
fact
did
establish
a
bright
line
rule
that
the
prosecutor
had
to
actually
argue
it
had
to
invite
the--
ms.
amy
zapp
--i
think
he
had
to
use
words
that
communicated
that.
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
one
particular
phrase,
but
a
prosecutor
can
certainly
put
that
into
issue--
ms.
amy
zapp
--using
different...
different
words.
ms.
amy
zapp
i
do,
your
honor.
and
my...
my
reason
for
that
is
when
you
look
to
the
argument
itself,
those
words
were
used
in
a
very
controlled
situation.
they...
they
did
not
by
their
tone
or
the
overall
tenor
of
the
argument
or
their
content
tell
the
jury
to
take
the...
the
defendant's
future
dangerousness
into
account.
ms.
amy
zapp
well,
i
think
this
court
has
said
that
you
can
draw
that
line
because...
and
you
have
to
draw
that
line
because
in
this
situation...
because
in
every
situation,
every
capital
situation,
the
evidence
that
necessarily
has
to
be
discussed
as
part
of
sentencing
can
be--
ms.
amy
zapp
--i...
i
don't
think
so
in
the
specific
context
of
this
case,
your
honor,
and
that's
again
because
the
evidence
in
this
situation
really
did
not
show
a
continuing
sequence
of...
of
conduct
and
only
talked
about
two
episodes.
and
the
fact
that
there
was
evidence
in...
or
there
were
remarks
in
this
case
about
how
the
violence
had
escalated
did
not,
again,
go
to...
suggest
and...
and
clearly
the
tone
of
the
prosecutor
did
not
suggest
that
the
jury
should
draw
from
that
a
conclusion
that
the
defendant
would
be
dangerous.
ms.
amy
zapp
we
are,
your
honor,
and...
and--
ms.
amy
zapp
--we
are
not
making
the
argument.
ms.
amy
zapp
yes.
ms.
amy
zapp
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
zapp
because--
ms.
amy
zapp
--well,
because
the
concurring
opinion,
which
provides
the...
this
precise
holding,
identified
that
specific
conduct
as
triggering
and
could
be
understood
at
the
time
to
require
that
specific
conduct
to
trigger
an
instruction
in
these
circumstances.
ms.
amy
zapp
the
specific
words
were
the...
the
court's
instruction
that
an...
about
a
charge
on
all
ineligibility
had
to
be
supplied,
and
i'm
going
to
quote
from
the
court's
opinion
where...
where
the
prosecution
argues
that
the
defendant
will
pose
a
threat
to...
to
society
in
the
future.
that...
that
opinion...
and
just
a
few
lines
earlier
it
also
said,
again...
and
i'm
going
to
quote
the
words...
if
the
prosecution
does
not
argue
future
dangerousness,
the
state
may
appropriately
decide
that
parole
is
not
a
proper
issue
for
the
jury's
consideration
even
if
the
only
sentencing
alternative
to
death
is
life
in
prison
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
ms.
amy
zapp
not...
not
that...
not
that
it
has
to
use
talismanic--
ms.
amy
zapp
--exactly,
that
has
to
be
argument
as
opposed
to
some
other
form
of
communication--
ms.
amy
zapp
--but
by--
ms.
amy
zapp
--but
by
contrast--
ms.
amy
zapp
--exactly.
ms.
amy
zapp
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor--
ms.
amy
zapp
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
he
did
not
make
that
argument.
he
never
asked
if
it
was
frightening
that
he
had
learned
from
this.
the
word
frightening...
again,
this
has
been
used
out
of
context
by
my...
my
learned
colleague...
went
to...
strictly
went
to
the
discussion
of
similarities
between
the
crimes,
not
the
defendant.
and
in
this
situation--
ms.
amy
zapp
--but...
but
again,
justice
ginsburg,
that
goes
to
the
idea
that
the
defendant
has
ratcheted
up
his
crime,
that
instead
of
taking
the
opportunity
to
reform
his
life,
he's
gone
further
and
that
makes
this
crime
worse
and...
and
more
worthy
of
harsher
treatment
from
a
punishing
standpoint.
it
is
our
position
that
in
1998
when
the
state
courts
ruled,
it
was
entirely
reasonable
for
the
supreme
court
to
view
simmons
as
requiring
that
issues
of
future
dangerousness
be
generated
by
the
prosecution's
argument.
ms.
amy
zapp
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
practice
in
other
states,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
in
pennsylvania...
and
this
is
a
point
i
need
to
correct
from
my
opponent's
argument.
the
answer
to
the
question
about
parole
eligibility
is
not
a
simple
no.
and
that...
our
supreme
court
has
said
that.
we
have
a
statutory
prohibition
in
granting
the...
granting
parole
to
someone
who's
sentenced
to
life,
but
we
also
have
a
constitutional
provision
that
allows
the
sentence
to
be
commuted
to,
among
other
things,
parole
or
other
forms
of
early
release.
our
state
supreme
court
has
said
you...
in
order
to
be
entirely
accurate
for
sentencing
jury,
you've
got
to
communicate
both
of
those
conducts.
and...
and
the
second
part
that
has
over
the
years...
and
this
goes
to
respond
to
your
question...
has
caused
our
court
some
pause
in
why
we
retain
the
rule.
and
that
is
they
are
very
concerned.
our
courts
have
expressed
the
view
that
by
letting
the
jury
know
that
the
operation
of
the
constitutional
provision
which
can
theoretically...
and,
in
fact,
in
the
past
often
has
resulted
in
a
life
sentence
being
commuted...
it
may
be
skewing
the
jury's
perception
of
the
punishments
adversely
to
a
defendant.
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
have
made
a
decision
not
to
introduce
sentencing
information
into...
early
release
information
into
the
sentencing
process
in
pennsylvania,
the
concern
that
if
a
jury
hears
that
there's
some
theoretical
possibility
or
learns
that
it
has
been...
been
actual...
there's
been
actual
early
release
in
the
past,
that
it
may...
may,
out
of
an
exercise
of
caution,
automatically
choose
a
death
sentence.
ms.
amy
zapp
well,
i'm
sorry.
well,
that
it's...
they...
they
have
serious
concerns,
your
honor,
that...
that
this
is
something
that
is
necessary
to
the
integrity
of
the
process.
and
there
are
two
other
concerns
they've
also
mentioned
too.
they're...
they're
concerns
that...
that
the
jury
be
deflected
from
the
specific
process
that
we
have
under
law
which...
which
is...
which
is
specified
in
our
law
for...
for
imposing
a
sentence
and
not
be
distracted
by
undue
speculation
about
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
ever
going
to
be
released
from
prison.
and
the
second...
or
excuse
me.
the
third
point
that
they're
worried
about
is
that
a
sentencing
jury
who,
for
whatever
reason,
becomes
reluctant
to...
to
carry
out
its
duties
may
see
this
as
an
opportunity
to
shift
the
sentencing
burden
to
somebody
like
a
parole
board
or...
or
other
sentencing
authority.
and
so
that's
why
they
have...
they've
enforced
this
rule
because
they
just
see
it
as
underscoring
the
integrity
of
the
process.
ms.
amy
zapp
not
in
this
circumstance,
justice
stevens,
and...
and
for
this
reason.
the
information
that
is
typically
contained
in
those
files...
and...
and
again,
i...
i
want
to
add
some
additional
information
for
the...
for
the
court
on
this
point.
as
mr.
nolas
says,
pennsylvania
law
does
require
preparation
of
records,
including
certain
types
of
information.
but
as...
as
is
often
the
case,
the...
the...
in...
in
practical...
and
the
practical
realities
are
not
necessarily
all
records
are
equal.
so
as
a
matter
of
practice,
in
pennsylvania
attorneys
cannot
necessarily...
or
would
not
automatically
have
reason
to
think
these
may
give
them
a
wealth
of
information.
but
in
this
situation
we
had
counsel
seeking
to
obtain
that
very
same
information,
in
fact,
had
previously
discussed
that
sort
of
thing
with
the
family
members.
and
so
they
at
that
point
would
have
reasonably
expected
that
they
had
a
fair
picture
of
the
defendant's
formative
years--
ms.
amy
zapp
--right.
ms.
amy
zapp
well,
they
knew
from
interviewing
their
client
what
his
criminal
history
was,
and
at
that...
this
point,
they
had
every
reason
to
believe
they
possessed
a
fair
and
accurate
assessment
of
his
background,
and
the
decision
not
to...
to
go...
to...
to
take
a
look
at
this
was...
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
counsel
thought
they
already
had
that
information
and
no
reason
to
expect
there
was
anything
else
in
there
based
on
their
discussions
with
their
own
client.
ms.
amy
zapp
oh,
no,
justice
ginsburg.
and
again,
we're
talking
about
the
sequence
of
events
here.
the...
this...
this
came
up
relatively
later
on
in
the
proceedings
after
counsel
had
already
expended
much
of
their
time
gathering
information
in
the...
the
information
about
what
was
going
to
be
introduced.
it...
it
happens,
in...
in
terms
of
the
time
line
of
this
case,
relatively
late,
after
counsel
has
already
talked
to
experts
and
obtained
information,
talked
to
family
members
and...
and--
ms.
amy
zapp
--the...
the--
ms.
amy
zapp
--the...
i'm
sorry.
the...
the
file
itself,
the...
the
information
the
file
was
going
to
be
used.
ms.
amy
zapp
comparatively
late
over
the
course
of
this
case.
the
counsel
had
already
done
things
in
that
respect
that
would
have
led
them
to
conclude
that
there
would
be
no
profit
in...
in
searching
out
additional
records.
ms.
amy
zapp
this
is
the
record
that
did
exist.
ms.
amy
zapp
i
believe--
ms.
amy
zapp
--well,
your...
your
honor,
in
response
to
that,
i
would
say
this.
it's
clear
from
the
testimony
of
counsel
in
the
state
post-conviction
proceedings
that
they
had
interviewed
their
client
in
great
detail
about
his
prior
conviction,
that
they
were
aware
of
what
had...
what
it
had
involved.
ms.
amy
zapp
well,
i
think
there
is--
ms.
amy
zapp
--well,
i
think
there's...
there
is
an
element.
ms.
amy
zapp
i
can
agree
with...
i
do
agree
with
it
in
part.
ms.
amy
zapp
i...
i
do
agree
that
there
is...
that
there
is
certainly
that
involved
in...
in
this.
ms.
amy
zapp
but...
but,
justice
breyer,
yes,
certainly
looking
at
a
record
would
serve
those
purposes.
but
again,
the
information
in
those
records
was
available
from
other
sources.
it
was
not
the
only
source.
and...
and
the
question
that
we
have
to
look
at
here
was
did
counsel
set
out
on
a
plan
to
try
to
get
the
same
information,
which
clearly
they
did,
and
they...
they
sought
to
get
it
from
people
who
ostensibly
knew
that
information.
thank
you.
