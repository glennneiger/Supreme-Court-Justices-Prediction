justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
asking
us,
i
suppose,
to
make
a
rule
that
you
have
to
get
paper
records.
we've
seen
a
number
of
capital
cases,
you
know...
as
you
know.
this
counsel
seemed
to
me
to
be
quite
articulate
and...
and
had
a
very
sound
theory
of...
to
argue
to
the
jury
for
mitigation.
it
didn't
work,
of
course.
i...
i
just
don't
know
what
constitutional
rule
you
want
to
ask
us
for,
that
you
have
to
look
at
record
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
had
three
forensic
experts,
outside
experts,
and
they
didn't
seem
to
think
the
papers
were
relevant
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
any
indication
that
after
the
guilt
phase
was
over
and
before
the
sentencing
phase
began...
i
take
it
it
was
just
a
matter
of
hours
or
almost
days
till
the
sentencing...
till
the
sentencing
phase
began.
was
there
any
contact
with
the
psychiatrists
or
with
experts
after
the
sentencing
phase
and
the...
pardon
me...
after
the
guilt
phase
and
before
the
sentencing
phase?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
did
the
prosecution
use?
the
fact
of
early...
early
conviction
and
the
details
of
the
crime.
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
don't
like
to
either
direct
your
own
argument
or
the
questions
from
my
colleagues,
but
the
simmons
issue
here--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
is
important
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
there
had
been
no
questions
from
the
jury,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
wouldn't
have
had
an
argument
at
all
because
the
counsel
was
allowed...
the
counsel
was
allowed
to
argue
this
to
the
jury
and
did
argue
it
to
the
jury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you...
would
you
agree
that
but
for
the
questions
from
the
jury,
simmons
was
complied
with?
the
counsel
argued
the
point
to
the
jury--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--without
being...
without
being
contradicted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
so
now...
now
we
have
a
situation
where
the
case,
by
my
suggestion
in
any
event,
was
properly
presented
to
the
jury,
and
the
only
question
is
what
the
constitutional
obligation
is
once
the
jury
brings
in
a
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
the
best
argument
you
have
that
future
dangerousness
was
an
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that
also
bears
on
the...
on
the
fact
of
his
depravity,
that
he
was
just...
he
just
didn't
learn.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
if
that's
necessarily
future
dangerousness
or...
it's
equally
blameworthiness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
goes
to
his
blameworthiness.
he
didn't
learn
anything
in
prison.
i...
i
suppose
future
dangerousness
is...
in
a
sense
is
always
in
question,
but
i
think
our
precedents
say
it
has
to
be
specifically
or...
or
clearly
implied.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i
know
you
want
to
get
to
the
other
issue
in
this
case,
but
let
me
ask
you.
you've,
i
assume,
read
these
cases.
in...
in
other
states
where
this
instruction
is
given,
is
the
prosecutor
free
to
say,
well,
sure,
there's
life
without
parole,
but
that
can
change?
we
don't
know
what
the
law
will
be
like
3
years
from
now,
5.
have
there
been
any
problems
along
that...
along
those
lines?
have
there
been
any
problems
generally
in
giving
this
instruction
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
sounds
to
me
like
a
constitutional
argument
for
serendipity.
you're
held
to
be
negligent
if
you
don't
look
at
the
record
for...
for
one
purpose
and...
and
discover
by
accident
something
that's
there
for
another
purpose.
i...
i
don't
know
what
the
logic
of
that
is.
