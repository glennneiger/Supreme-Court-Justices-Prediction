justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel...
counsel
did
make
use
of
several
relatives
of
the
defendant
who
testified.
i...
i
think
weren't
there
about
four
relatives
who
testified?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he
talked
to
all
of
them
and
talked
to
the
defendant
as
well.
so
would
a
reasonable
person
think
that's
enough
to
find
out
family
history
and...
and
the
concerns
that
you
had?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
didn't
expressly.
i
mean,
there...
there
were
arguments
about
his
behavior,
but
the
problem
i
think
we
have
with
the
simmons
claim
here
is
that
the
kelly
case
had
not
yet
been
decided,
and
you
now
have
the
aedpa
situation
of
trying
to
show
that
the
state
court's
resolution
was
objectively
unreasonable.
and
prior
to
kelly,
that's
a
pretty
tough
road
for
you.
