ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
ineffectiveness
argument
seems
to
be
hinging
on
four
things
which
are
the
court
records
in
the
aggravation
case,
the
charge
to
the
expert,
the
family
members'
level
of
cooperation,
and
the
petitioner's
level
of
cooperation.
but
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
demonstrates
that
counsel
was
reasonable
with
respect
to
all.
but
i
want
to
start
with
the
court
records
because
that
appears
to
be
what's
concerning
the
court.
i
think
there's
a
misperception
here
that
counsel
did
nothing
to
prepare
for
the
aggravation
case.
the
record,
fairly
read,
reflects
that
they
received
through
the
discovery
process
the
rap
sheet
and
everything
they
needed
to
know
in
order
to
challenge
the...
the
aggravation
case,
and
that's
at
ja664
and
667,
is
attorney
charles
testifying
that
he
received
the
rap
sheet
through
discovery
and
that
the
prosecutor,
in
order
to
try
and
induce
a
plea,
was
very,
very
clear
about
what
he
intended
to
do
in
aggravation
and
what
the
aggravation
case
would
be.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
i...
i
think--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question.
first
is
that
counsel
was,
in
fact,
looking
at
the
testimony
that
would
be
read
at...
during
the
aggravation
and
sentencing
case
to
determine
how
to
challenge
that,
how
best
to
challenge
that.
and
second,
the
assumption
of
the
question
is
that
the
court
records
were
somehow
superior
to
the
sources
that
counsel
actually
looked
to.
and
i
don't
think
on
the
record
of
this
case,
that's
objectively
true.
counsel
is...
has...
has
hired
three
independent
experts,
all
of
whom
are
specifically
trained--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i'm
glad
you
brought
this
up
because
i'd
like
to
point
the
court
to
ja1069
and
1079
which
is
where
dr.
cooke
testifies,
as
justice
scalia
anticipated,
that
he
was,
in
fact,
asked
to...
asked
to
look
at
the
mitigation
evidence,
and
he
did
look
at
mitigation
evidence.
dr.
sadoff
has
the
same
testimony--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--dr.--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--dr.
cooke's
and...
drs.
cooke
and
sadoff
testified
that
they
were
given
an
open-ended
charge
to
look
at
mitigation--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--first,
dr.
cooke
is
at
ja1079
and
1069.
dr.
sadoff
is
at
1105
and
1122.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
that
is...
that
is
definitely
contested
with
respect
to
drs.
cooke
and
sadoff.
with
respect
to
dr.
gross,
who
was
the
first
expert
that
was
hired,
he
testified
that
his
marching
orders
were
fairly
limited,
and
i
think
that's
where
this
idea
is
coming
across
that
all
the
experts
were
only
charged
to
look
for
competency
to
stand
trial.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
yes.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
no,
because
counsel
looked...
followed
up
in
an
objectively
reasonable
place.
their
testimony
was
that
they
hired
two
more
experts
to
look
at
this
issue,
and
dr.
gross
did
not
conclude--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--the
two...
the
two
other
psychiatrists.
because
the
issue
wasn't
alcoholism.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
no.
dr.
gross'
report
says
he
might
have
a
violent
reaction
to
alcohol.
and
he
testified
that
was...
i
was
throwing
that
out
as
a
theory.
i
have
no
idea.
i
had
ruled
out
alcoholism.
i
had
ruled
out
blackouts.
and
so
the
question
to
me
was
maybe
there's
something
out
there
about
violent
chemical
reactions
to
alcohol.
counsel
testified
that
the...
that
they
followed
up
on
that
by
hiring
experts
who
they
thought
could
examine
that
issue,
and
they
both
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
there.
this
is
not
an
instance
where
you
have,
you
know,
open
inquiries
that
counsel
didn't
follow
up
on.
every
court
in
this
case
has
recognized--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--that
they
received
everything
they
needed
to
challenge
the
aggravation
case
through
discovery.
and
there's
a
little
bit--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--they
had
everything
they
needed
to
challenge
the
aggravation--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--but
the
sixth
amendment
question--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--i...
i
think
that
they
had...
obviously,
in
retrospect,
the
court
files
would
have
been
helpful,
but
they
had
nothing
to
signal
that
the
court
files
would
give
them
more
information.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
they
did.
they
received
them
through
discovery.
and
this
is...
there's
some
testimony
during...
during
the
court
proceedings,
attorney
dantos
does
not
have
the
transcript
with
her,
and
she
clarified
in
the
testimony
at
post-conviction--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--yes,
yes,
and
that's
her
testimony
at
ja506
to
508.
she
says,
we
received
it
in
discovery
and
i
had
it
and
i've
looked
it,
but
i
didn't
have
it
with
me
at
that
moment.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
the
it
being
the
transcripts
of
the
proceedings
that
were
used
in
the
aggravation
case.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
but
they
did
not--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--exactly.
because
they
had
conducted
an
objectively
reasonable
investigation
into
anything
else
that
might
be
in
that
file.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
well,
the
testimony
is
clear.
counsel
knew
about
the
abuse
denial
dynamic
and
they
did
follow
up
on
it
by
hiring
three
experts
who
were
charged
to
ferret
this
out.
and
it
would
do
constitutional
harm
to
say,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
you
did
that,
you
still
have
to
go
to
records
because
as
strickland
recognizes,
counsel,
even
where
you
have
diligent,
devoted
counsel,
as
here,
have
to
make
decisions
about
resource
and
time
allocation.
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
but
this
was
the
current...
this
is
the
current
federal
practice.
i
think
attorney
charles
testifies
at
length
that
the
prevailing
practice
in
1988
in
pennsylvania
was
not
to
get
records,
that
it
was,
as
the
aba
guidelines
and
even
the
goodpaster
article
suggests,
to
first
sit
down
with
your
client,
have
an
extensive
conversation
with
your
client,
get
a
relationship
of
trust,
talk
to
family
members,
talk
to
friends,
get
experts,
and
then
get
a
game
plan
together
about
what
records
to
go
to.
and
in
this
case--
ms.
traci
l.
lovitt
--because
that
objectively
reasonable
investigation
affirmatively
indicated
that
the
records
would
contain
nothing.
in
hindsight,
we
have
the
benefit
of
hindsight
to
know
that
they
did
contain
something,
but
at
that
point
you
have
three
experts,
siblings
who
bracket
petitioner
in
age
and
were
living
in
the
same
household
that...
during
the
time
that's
at
issue
here,
and
you
have
extended
family
members,
including
an
ex-wife,
who
aren't
subject
to
an
abuse
denial
dynamic,
and
they're
all
saying
the
same
thing.
there's
no
abuse.
there's
no
alcohol
problem
with
either
him
or
the
family.
and
the
experts
are
telling
you
he's
not
mentally
retarded.
and
you
have
experts
who
are
specifically
charged
to
look
at
the
mitigation
case
and
they're
not
finding
anything.
