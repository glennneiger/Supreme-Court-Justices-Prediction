justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
seems
to
me
an...
an
extraordinary
non
sequitur.
i
don't
understand.
they
didn't
want
to
deal
with
it
because
they
thought
he
was
innocent.
i...
how
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
she
testified
to
makes
no
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the...
the
portions
of
his
life
history
that...
that
are
the
most
appealing
are
the
portions
from
his
youth,
before
he
went
into
the...
into
the
juvenile
institutions,
and
they
were
certainly
with
him
during
that
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me...
let
me
take
you
back
to
the...
to
the
experts.
you
say
he
did
not
specifically
ask
the
experts
to
go...
to
go
into
his
childhood
problems.
you
know,
i
can
imagine
when
the
expert
comes
on
the
stand,
the
first
question
being
asked
is,
now,
mr.
expert,
were
you
told
by
counsel
to
look
into
the
childhood
problems?
you
know,
as
though
counsel
were
planting
in
the
expert's
mind
what
the
expert
should
say.
what
would
anyone
who
hires
a
psychologist
or
a
psychiatrist...
what
would
anyone
expect
him
to
look
into
in...
in
determining
whether
the
person
is...
is
mentally
injured
but...
but
the
childhood?
do
you
really
think
counsel
could
not
have
expected
with
total
assurance
that
these
people
would
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
what
you
just
quoted
said
that
they...
that
they
would
intend
it
to
be
used
in
the
mitigating
phase.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't...
doesn't
all
that
bear
upon
mental
infirmity
at
the
time
of
the
offense?
isn't
the
reason
that...
that
one
considers
these
factors
mitigating
is
that
they
reduce
the
guilt
at
the
time
of
the
offense?
i...
i
thought
that
that's
the
whole--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we...
we
just
let
him
off
because
we're...
we're
sympathetic
to
his
present
state?
i
thought
that
mitigation
means
that
it
reduces
the
guilt
of
the
offense
at
the
time
that
he
commits
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
want
us
to
adopt
a
constitutional
rule
that
at
least
in
pennsylvania
counsel
have
to
consult
these...
these
records--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
a
constitutional
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your...
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
a
constitutional
rule
that
in
pennsylvania
counsel
must
look
into
these
records.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
what
purpose
did
the
prosecution
use
the
files?
justice
antonin
scalia
use
them
for...
he
did
use
them
for
aggravation.
justice
antonin
scalia
in...
in
what
respect?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
imagine
any
capital
case,
if
we
accept
that
argument,
in
which
future
dangerousness
is
not
at
issue?
because
whenever
you
show
the
depravity
of
the
defendant,
what
a
horrible
crime
it
was,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
make
the
same
argument.
any
jury
is
going
to
be
frightened
of
this
man
and
think
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
in
the
future.
if
that's
all...
if
that's
all
that
simmons
means,
we
should
just
say
in
all
capital
cases,
you
assume
that
it's
at
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
seems
to
be
not
what
we've
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
goes...
i...
i
would
make
that
argument
to
show
how...
how
horrible
this
crime
was.
he
killed
this
person
specifically
in
order
to
prevent
testimony,
which
makes
the...
the
crime
worse.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
goes
to
future
dangerousness
any
more
than
any
of
the
element...
other
elements
of
depravity
or...
or
the
horribleness
of
the
crime
goes...
goes
to
future
dangerousness.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
you...
you
expect
us
in
all
future
cases
to
read
the
prosecution's
argument
and...
and
say,
well,
has
it
gone
over
the
line
from
just
his
depravity
into
he's
future...
you
know,
he's
going
to
be
dangerous
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
puts
too
much
of
a
burden
on...
on
the
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
justice?
i
mean,
is
that
the
only
alternative
to
vengeance,
is...
is
future
dangerousness?
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
zapp,
i
guess...
i
guess
i'm
confused
about
your
case.
i
had
thought
that
you
were
not
arguing
that
simmons
requires
a
talismanic
word
or
even
that
it
requires
much
more
than
existed
here.
i
thought
what
you
were
arguing
is
simply
that
simmons
could
at
that
time
have
been
interpreted
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
not...
you're
not
making
the
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
the
argument
could
have
been
made
at...
at
the
time
of
this
trial--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
before
our
later
jurisprudence.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
argued.
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
just
intimated,
not
just
suggested,
but
the
jury...
you
have
to
argue
that
this
person--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
dangerous
in
the
future.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
it
i
would
think.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
explains
why
your
state
is
the
only
holdout.
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
could
i
find
out
what
she
said
came
late?
i...
i
didn't
understand.
you
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
came...
what
came
relatively
late?
justice
antonin
scalia
came
up
late.
justice
antonin
scalia
only?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
uncontested
that
all
three
looked
into
that,
but
the
point
that
has
been
made
is
that
the
last
two
went
beyond
that.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
