justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
nolas,
you
haven't
mentioned
it,
but
didn't
one
of
the
three
experts
suggest
that
there
be
a...
a
follow-up
inquiry
into
the...
the
abuse
of
alcohol
by
the
defendant?
justice
david
h.
souter
my
understanding
is
that
nothing
was
done
in
response
to
that.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
which...
which
you're
saying
they
did
not
do.
i
mean,
just
to
get
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
what
would
they
have
found?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
the...
that
the
argument
that
the
prosecutor
makes
has
got
to
refer
explicitly
to
future
dangerousness,
a
kind
of
talismanic
words
criterion
so
that
we'll
have
a
bright
line
rule
and
everyone
will
know
where...
where
he
stands?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
has...
has
the
prosecutor
got
to
use
a
phrase
like
future
dangerousness
or
a
synonym
for
that
phrase?
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we...
if
we
don't
adopt
that
kind
of
explicit
words
criterion,
do
you
deny
that
the...
that
the
argument
that
the
prosecutor
made,
particularly
the...
by...
by
introducing
the...
the
evidence
of...
of
the
prior
crime
for
purposes
of
the
aggravating
factor
and
the
argument
that
he
made
about
how
the
defendant
had
learned
from
his
prior
crime...
do
you...
do
you
deny
that...
that
those
were
in
fact,
not
with
the
talismanic
words,
but
that
those
in
fact
were...
were
arguments
that
suggested
future
dangerousness?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i...
i
don't
see
how
the...
i...
i
guess
my...
my
point
is
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
it.
the...
the
argument...
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
the
argument
was
this
person
has
committed
repeated
crimes.
we're
asking
you
to
bear
that
in
mind
for
the
purposes
of
applying
one
of
the
three
aggravating
factors.
in
the
course
of
committing
repeated
crimes,
he
has
learned
from
past
mistakes;
i.e.,
he
knows
this
time
not
to
leave
any
witnesses.
how
can
you
divide
the
tendency
of
that
argument,
repeated
crimes
for
purposes
of
aggravation,
from
the
tendency
of
that
argument
to
say
repeated
crimes
in
the
future
if
he
gets
a
chance?
this
is
the
kind
of
guy
we're
dealing
with.
how
can
you
draw
that
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
this
is...
this
is
a
special
case.
this
is
not
a
general
argument
to
the
effect
that
this
is
a
very
bad
person
and
we
can
expect
bad
persons
to
be
bad
in
the
future.
this
is
a
more
specific
argument.
this
is
an
argument
that
says
he's
now
done
it
twice.
this
is
the
second
crime
and
he's
getting
better
at
it
as
he
goes
along
because
now
he
kills
the
witnesses.
this
isn't
just
generalized
badness.
this
is
criminal
repetitiveness.
it
is
recidivism.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
much
clearer
argument.
it
is
much
closer
to
the
explicit
argument
that
he
will
do
it
in
the
future.
justice
david
h.
souter
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
why
would
that
argument
have
been
reasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
why...
why
would
we...
why
would
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
this
court
had...
had
established
a
constitutional
rule
going
to
jury
instruction
that
rested
on
a
kind
of
talismanic
criterion?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
specific
words
in...
in
the
concurring
opinion
gets
to
the
talismanic
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
you're...
you're
depending
on
the
word,
in
effect,
argue
as...
as
requiring...
or
as...
as
being
a
basis
to
say
the
argument
has
got
to
use
talismanic
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
on
that
interpretation,
why
wasn't
it
an
argument
within
the
meaning
of...
of
your
point,
when
the
prosecutor
here
got
up
and
said,
isn't
it
frightening,
he
has,
in
effect,
learned
from
his
past
experience,
now
he
knows
enough
to
kill
the
witnesses?
justice
david
h.
souter
wasn't
that
an
argument
which...
which
goes
to
future
dangerousness?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
dr.
gross
is
the
one
who...
who
in
his
report
suggested
a
follow-up
on
alcoholism
i
think.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
one
way,
at
least
a
kind
of
a
threshold
step
to
follow
up
on
alcoholism,
would
have
been
to
look
at
the...
the
personal
history
report
in
the
file
of
the
prior
case.
if
they
had
done
so,
they
would
have
found
something
on
that
subject.
so
even...
even
if
we
forget
the
question
of
the...
the
scope
of
the
expert's
original
brief
and
we
look
to
dr.
gross'
suggestion
and
we
look
to
the
failure
to
look
in
an
obvious
place,
i.e.,
the...
the
personal
history
report
and...
and
the
case
file,
which
the
state
said
it
was
going
to
use,
don't
we
have
a
problem
with
competence
of
counsel?
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
two
other
psychiatrists
or
psychologists?
justice
david
h.
souter
wel,
were
they...
were
they
hired
to...
to
look
into
alcoholism?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
petitioner
ronald
rompilla
was
convicted
of
capital
murder.
in
preparing
for
the
penalty
phase
at
the
trial,
at
which
rompilla
might
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
or
to
death,
rompilla’s
counsel
sought
mitigating
evidence
from
rompilla
from
some
of
his
family
members
and
from
medical
experts.
those
to
us
has
proved
unhelpful
and
in
the
end,
rompilla’s
penalty
phase
defense
relied
on
residual
doubt
and
a
plea
for
mercy.
the
states
penalty
case
as
based
in
part
on
the
record
of
victim
testimony
from
an
earlier
trial
that
had
resulted
in
rompilla’s
conviction
for
rape,
a
crime
that
he
had
committed
under
similar
circumstances
to
this
one.
rompilla
was
sentenced
to
death
and
his
conviction
and
sentence
were
affirmed
on
appeal.
with
new
counsel,
rompilla
filed
for
post
conviction
relief
charging
that
his
trial
counsel
had
provided
ineffective
assistance
under
the
sixth
amendment.
rompilla’s
new
lawyers
argued
that
the
trial
counsel
had
failed
to
honor
a
significant
mitigating
evidence.
for
example,
an
easily
obtainable
school
and
prison
record
showed
that
rompilla
was
reared
in
a
slum
environment
by
a
father
who
terrorized
him
regularly
and
an
alcoholic
mother
who
drank
heavily
during
pregnancy
and
showed
that
rompilla
himself
exhibited
signs
of
schizophrenia.
the
states
courts,
however,
found
the
trial
counsel
had
not
been
deficient
in
failing
to
discover
this
evidence
because
by
interviewing
rompilla,
family
members
and
medical
experts,
they
had
made
sufficient
inquiries.
rompilla
then
filed
for
a
federal
habeas
relief
which
was
granted
by
the
district
court
but
reversed
by
a
divided
third
circuit.
as
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
in
looking
back
on
counsel’s
performance
in
a
case
like
this,
we
realize
that
counsel
act
in
the
thick
of
things
without
the
clarity
of
hindsight
but
we
can
find
no
objective
justification
for
one
of
the
counsel’s
significant
decisions
here.
counsel
knew
well
in
advance
that
the
prosecution
intended
to
introduce
dramatic
victim
testimony
from
the
prior
rape
trial
in
order
to
obtain
the
death
penalty.
nonetheless,
trial
counsel
never
looked
at
the
prior
conviction
file
even
though
it
was
easily
available
at
rompilla’s
trial
courthouse.
without
making
reasonable
efforts
to
review
the
file,
defense
counsel
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
prosecution
would
be
quoting
selectively
from
the
transcript
or
whether
there
were
circumstances
extenuating
the
behavior
described
by
the
victim.
the
obligation
to
get
the
file
was
particularly
pressing
here
owing
to
the
similarity
of
the
violent
prior
offense
and
to
rompilla’s
strategy
of
residual
doubt.
counsel’s
conversations
with
rompilla
and
his
family
could
not
reasonably
have
been
expected
to
substitute
for
looking
at
the
file
itself.
it
is
uncontested
that
if
counsel
had
looked
in
the
file,
they
would
have
found
documents
showing
a
range
of
new
mitigating
leads
including
evidence
of
rompilla’s
unusually
abusive
home
life
and
his
possible
mental
illness.
this
evidence
might
well
have
influenced
the
jury’s
assessment
of
rompilla
culpability.
for
these
reasons
and
others
given
in
the
opinion,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
and
require
pennsylvania
either
to
retry
the
case
on
penalty
or
to
stipulate
to
a
life
sentence.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
join.
