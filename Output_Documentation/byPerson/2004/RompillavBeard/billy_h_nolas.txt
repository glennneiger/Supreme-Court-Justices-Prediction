mr.
billy
h.
nolas
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
profound
mitigating
evidence
concerning
mr.
rompilla's
life
history
was
not
heard
by
the
capital
sentencing
jury
in
this
case
because
his
trial
counsel
did
not
secure
a
single
scrap
of
paper
about
his
life
history.
as
to
the
trial
prosecutor,
his
argument,
what
he
elicited
from
the
defense
witnesses,
and
what
he
presented
affirmatively
sent
the
message
to
this
jury
of
future
dangerousness.
when
the
jury
inquired
whether
in
pennsylvania
there
is
parole
from
a
life
sentence,
they
were
not
given
the
simple,
straight
answer
that
pennsylvania
law
clearly
indicates,
no.
instead,
they
were
told...
instead,
their
question
was
not
answered.
what
i
would
like
to
do,
unless
the
court
has
specific
inquiries,
is
to
make
certain
points
about
the
ineffectiveness
issue
and
then
turn
to
the
sentence
issue.
as
to
the
ineffectiveness
issue,
your
honors,
this
court
has
made
very
clear
in
williams
v.
taylor,
in
wiggins
v.
smith,
reiterating
the
concept
established
originally
in
strickland
v.
washington,
that
a
trial
defense
counsel
has
a
duty
to
conduct
a
thorough
investigation
for
mitigating
evidence
in
a
capital
case.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
set
a
constitutional
rule
that
a
capital
defense
counsel
must
obtain
records
in
every
capital
case.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
apply
the
rule
articulated
in
strickland
v.
washington
itself
where
the
court
indicated
that
counsel
has
a
duty
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
to
the
experts
themselves...
and
that's
actually...
the
experts
and
the
family
are
the
core
of
respondent's
argument
against
mr.
simmons'
claim.
the
simplest
answer
is
to
look
at
wiggins
v.
smith
where
this
court
held
very
clearly
that
the
retention
of
mental
health
experts
sheds
no
light
on
the
reasonableness
of
counsel's
life
history
investigation.
that
is
especially
appropriate
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
the
counsel
who
had
contact
with
the
experts
testified
very
clearly
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
that
the
experts
were
never
asked...
never
asked...
to
develop
life
history
mitigating
evidence.
and
as
my
friend,
ms.
zapp,
indicates
in
her
brief
at
page
43,
there
was
no
tactical
decision
in
this
case
by
counsel
to
not
pursue
life
history
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor,
including
his
son.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
this
court
made
very
clear
in
strickland
and
williams
and
in
wiggins
that
an
assessment
of
counsel's
representation
must
be
done
from
counsel's
perspective
at
the
time.
counsel's
perspective
at
the
time,
as
ms.
dantos
clearly
testified
at
the
hearing,
was
that
the
family
were
not
good
sources
of
information
for
petitioner's
life
history.
she
gave
three
reasons
for
that.
she
said,
number
one,
whenever
life
history
was
pursued
with
them,
they
did
not
want
to
deal
with
it
because
they
thought
he
was
innocent.
number
two,
whenever
they
were--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--that...
that's
what
she
testified
to,
your
honor.
i'm
not--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--she
gave
a
second
reason
which
was
that
counsel,
when
they
pursued
life
history
mitigation,
the
family
would
respond,
we
hardly
know
him.
he
was
in
juvenile
facilities
as
a
youth,
and
then
he
was
in
prison
as
an
adult.
we
don't
have
any
knowledge
of
his
life
history.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
and
third
and
most
significantly,
justice
scalia,
she
testified
that
they
were
not
willing
to
provide
life
history
mitigating...
facts
about
his
life
history
because
of,
quote,
whatever
else
was
going
on
with
them,
unquote.
or
as
mr.
charles,
the
other
attorney,
put
it,
these
were
not
the
type
of
family
that
would
provide
information
when
asked.
bear
in
mind,
both
of
these
counsel
knew
what
the
respondent's
post-conviction
rebuttal
psychologist
testified
to,
that
when
you're
dealing
with
abuse,
neglect,
a
dysfunctional
home,
people
don't
want
to
talk
about
that.
they
want
to
withhold
that.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
sure,
because
counsel
themselves
testified
to
that
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
and
the
experts
themselves
said...
now,
let
me--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor,
and
the...
the
respondents
use
the
word
mitigation
that
ms.
dantos
used
in
her
testimony.
i
only
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
472
where
ms.
dantos
says
very
clearly,
i
explained
to
them
the
purpose
for
my
contacting
them,
and
the
purpose
was
to
initially
see
if
there
was
any
issue
of
mental
infirmity
or
mental
insanity
for
the
guilt
phase
and
subsequently
to
possibly
use
in
mitigation
any
mental
infirmity
if
it...
if
the
jury
came
back
first
degree.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
no,
your
honor.
the
record
is
very
clear
that
the
experts
were
asked,
as
justice
ginsburg
indicated,
about
mental
infirmity
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
they
reported
back
that
they
could
provide
no
assistance
in
that
regard,
and
then
there
was
not
further
contact
with
them.
they
were
also
asked
about
competency,
which
is
not
at
issue
before
the
court.
the...
the
key
thing
to
bear
in
mind
is
you
can
look
through
ms.
dantos'
entire
testimony
and
look...
you
could
look
through
mr.
charles'
entire
testimony
at
the
hearing.
nowhere
do
they
say
we
asked
the
experts
to
develop
life
history
mitigating
information.
this
isn't
the
case
where
the
lawyers
say
to
the
doctor,
doctor,
i'm
looking
into
this
man's
life
history,
go
investigate
it.
tell
me
what
there
is.
tell--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--mental
infirmity
at
the
time
of
the
offense
at
the
penalty
phase,
not
life
history
mitigation,
not
how
did
he
do
in
school,
was
there
abuse
in
the
home,
was
there
neglect
in
the
home,
was
their
mistreatment
in
the--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--no,
your
honor.
that
is...
with
all
due
respect,
that
is
too
constricted
a
view
of
what--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--it's...
it's
not
let
him
off,
your
honor.
it's
a...
a
request
to
the
jury,
that
was
out
for
over
12
hours,
that
this
man
receive
a
life
sentence.
and
you've
already
resolved
this
issue
in
wiggins
v.
smith.
in
wiggins
v.
smith,
counsel
hired
a
mental
health
expert,
provided
that
expert
200
pages
of
dss
records,
provided
a
psi,
had
the
expert
interview
all
of
mr.
wiggins'
family
members,
had
the
expert
report
back
on,
quote/unquote,
mitigating
evidence,
and
this
court
found
that
counsel
had
failed
to
provide
reasonably
diligent
effective
assistance
because
counsel
had
not
developed
life
history
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
dr.
gross
suggested
that
there
be
a
follow-up
inquiry
into...
into
alcohol,
and
that--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--in
response
to
that,
the
reasonable
thing
would
be
why
did
this
man's
parole
records
indicate
that
he
should
abstain
from
alcohol.
let's
look
into
his
alcohol
history.
and
to
back
to...
to
your
question,
justice--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--they
testified
that
what
they
did
they
asked...
they
asked
the
other
experts
to
look
into
it.
and
bear
in
mind,
all
of
the
experts
in
this
case
had
less
than
the
expert
in
wiggins.
all
of
the
experts
in
this
case
had
less
than
the
expert
in
williams.
what
these
lawyers
gave
the
expert
is
a
client
that
they
themselves
said
is
not
a
reliable
source
of
information,
a
client
who
did
not
want
to
discuss
his
life
history,
a
client
who
misled
counsel,
a
client
who
these
lawyers
said
we
can't
rely
on...
on
this
fellow.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
was,
i
guess,
the
simplest
way
to
respond
to
justice
kennedy's
original
question,
which
is
what
is
the
duty
that
these
lawyers
have.
well,
at
its
simplest,
in
wiggins
this
court
said
counsel
has
a
duty
to
conduct
a
thorough
investigation
for
mitigating
evidence,
a
thorough
investigation
into
the
aggravation.
the
trial
prosecutor
tells
these
counsel,
i'm
going
to
use
that
information
in
that
file
against
your
client.
the
file
was
maintained
in
the
same
courthouse
in
which
this
case
was
tried.
counsel
never
goes
and
looks
at
that
file.
when
the
prosecutor
brings
it
to
the
penalty
phase,
they
complain,
we've
never
seen
this
file
before.
in
that
file--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--and
the
transcript
that's
included
of...
in
that
trial
of
the
prior
offense
victim's
testimony.
but
the
thing
is
what
if
these
lawyers
what...
what
i...
i
hope
this
court
would
expect
any
lawyer
to
do
when
the
prosecutor
says,
i'm
going
to
use
that
folder
against
you.
you
go
and
you
open
up
the
folder.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
they
would
have
found
achievement
test
scores
in
that
prior
conviction
case
file
indicating
that
mr.
rompilla
had
never
progressed
beyond
the
third
grade,
indicating
that
he
functions
below
96
percent
of
the
population.
he
lived
a
nomadic
life.
he...
and...
and
test
results
indicating
that
he
was
elevated
on
scales
for
schizophrenia,
paranoia,
neurosis,
indicating
that
he
grew
up
in
a
slum
environment,
and
that
he
was
an
alcoholic,
bearing
in
mind
dr.
gross'
original
inquiry.
these
are
also
lawyers
who
knew
that
mr.
rompilla
had
a
juvenile
history
and
had
a
prior
adult
criminal
history.
and
pennsylvania
lawyers
know...
we've
discussed
this
in
the
brief...
that
psi
records,
presentence
reports
in
pennsylvania,
and
juvenile
records
are
very
special
things
compared
to
such
records
in
other
states.
in--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
justice
stevens,
what
i
just
read
to
you.
now,
pennsylvania
lawyers--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--if
i
may
have
your
honor's
indulgence
for
a
moment.
yes,
your
honor.
that...
because
in
this
case,
that
prior
conviction
court
file
contained
records
that
were
produced
when
mr.
rompilla
was
evaluated
for
that
prior
conviction.
one
point
that
i
don't
want
to
escape
this
court's
attention
is
in
pennsylvania,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
pennsylvania...
the
pennsylvania
statutes
indicate
that
presentence
investigation
reports
and
juvenile
records
have
to
contain
information
relating
to,
quote,
educational
history,
psychological
history,
marital
history,
family
history,
military
history--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--when--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--justice
scalia,
when
state
law
tells
you
that
what
you're
going
to
find
in
juvenile
and
adult
records
is
exactly
what
the
aba
standards
say
capital
lawyers
should
pursue,
it's
not
diligent
to
ignore
the--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--yes--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--yes,
plus.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
and--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--the...
the
only
that's
special
to
pennsylvania
is
what
pennsylvania
law
tells
you
you're
going
to
find
in
those
files.
that
makes
it
different
than,
say,
georgia
where
there's
no
provision
for
having
that
material
in
those
files.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
the
prosecution
told
counsel
i'm
going
to
use
these
files
as
part
of
my
case
and
eventually
use
them
for
aggravation
purposes.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
he
put
on...
he...
he
had
an
assistant
district
attorney
take
the
stand
and
read
the
transcript
of
the
victim's
testimony
in
the
prior
case,
which
was
included
in
that
folder.
he
also
used
information
about
when
mr.
rompilla
incarcerated,
paroled,
et
cetera
that
was
reflected
by
that
folder.
so
plainly
these
lawyers
knew
that
that
trial
was
going
to
be
used
because
the
prosecutor
told
them.
one
other
factor
on...
on
the
duty
of
the
counsel.
these
counsel
testified
that
they
knew
that
mr.
rompilla
had
problems
in
school
and
left
school
early.
the
school
administration
building
in
allentown
is
across
the
street
from
the
capital
case
courthouse.
ms.
zapp
will
confirm
this.
it
says
school
administration
building.
you
walk
by
it
when
you
go
into
this
courthouse.
they
knew
he
had
problems
in
school.
they
never
walked
in
there
and
asked
somebody,
let
me
look
at
the
file.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honor,
i
will
turn
to
that.
i
will
to
turn
to
that
with
more
sentence
on
the
ineffective
issue,
and
that
sentence
is
that
the
respondent's
argument
in
this
case
misstates,
with
all
due
respect
to...
to
my
friend,
ms.
zapp...
misstates
the
holding
of
wiggins.
the
respondent
reads
wiggins
as
holding
only
that
when
counsel
has
a
lead,
counsel
should
pursue
a
thorough
life
history
investigation.
i...
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
these
lawyers
here
had
leads,
but
even
if
they
didn't,
the
holding
of
simmons...
the
first
holding
of
simmons
is
that
counsel
has
a
duty
to
conduct
a
thorough
life
history
mitigation
investigation
and
cannot
rely
on
rudimentary
knowledge
from
a
narrow
set
of
sources.
these
counsel
had
less
of
a
rudimentary
knowledge
than
the
counsel
in
simmons
because
they
relied
upon--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--in
wiggins.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
because
they
relied
upon
what
they
themselves
knew
was
a
remarkably
set
of
sources,
a
family
and
a
client
who
were
not
willing
to
discuss
the
information
when
they
knew
records
were
available
that
would
have
discussed
the
life
history.
turning
to
the
simmons
issue,
justice
kennedy,
the
core
of
the
simmons
issue,
the
core
debate
before
the
court,
is
what
does
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
simmons
mean.
the--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--the...
the
questions
are
very
significant,
your
honor.
my...
my
instinct
would
be
there
would
be--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--the--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--justice
kennedy,
the
caveat
is
that
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
the
arguments
of
counsel
are
not
evidence
and
that
the
law
would
come
from
the
court.
and
in
that
context,
how
much
weight
did
they
give
on
the
passing
reference
in
ms.
dantos'
closing
argument?
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case
because
we
know
what
the
jury
was
concerned
about.
they
were
concerned
about
parole
and
they
were
concerned
about
that
because
the
prosecutor--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--the
constitutional
obligation
under
simmons
itself
would
be
to
say
is
there
something
here
or
in...
in
the
words
of
justice
o'connor,
did
the
state
put
future
dangerousness
in
issue.
and
in
this
case--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--and
that
may
be...
that
would
have
been
the
case,
your
honor,
had
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
not
adopted
the
very
interpretation
of
your
honor's
concurrence
in
simmons
that
kelly
adopted.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
three
times
said
simmons
means
you
get
a
life
without
parole
instruction
in
pennsylvania
when
the
state
puts
future
dangerousness
at
issue.
the
construction
that
the
respondent
gives
to
simmons
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
gave
to
simmons,
specifically
that
it
only
applies
when
the
prosecutor
argues
that
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed
because
of
future
dangerousness,
not
only
is
not
to
be
found
in
justice
o'connor's
concurrence,
but
it
is
not
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
there
are
several
factors
in
that
regard,
your
honor.
as
to
the
argument
itself,
the
prosecutor
called
mr.
rompilla
a
very
strong
individual,
a
very
violent
individual.
he
asked
the
jury,
isn't
it
frightening
the
similarity
between
his
past
crime
and
this
crime?
he
sent
the
clear
signal
to
the--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--he...
he
sent
the--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--justice
kennedy,
he
sent
the
clear
signal
to
the
jury
that
this
is
a
violent,
frightening
man,
and
then
he
tied
it
all
together
with
this
comment.
and
i
think
he
learned
a
lesson
from
his
prior...
prior
crime,
and
that
lesson
was
don't
leave
any
witnesses.
don't
leave
anybody
behind
that
can
testify
against
you.
don't
leave
any
eyewitness.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
argument
indicates
to
a
reasonable
jury
future
dangerousness
as
much
as
the
argument
in
simmons
itself--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--and...
and--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--and,
justice
scalia,
that's
not,
however,
the
issue
before
the
court.
what
this
prosecutor
told
the
jury
is
this
man
learned
a
lesson
that
when
he
commits
his
repeated
crimes,
he
shouldn't
leave
any
witnesses
behind.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
i--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--and...
and
this
is
in
the
context
of
a
prosecutor
who
elicited
that
mr.
rompilla
had
been
paroled
3
and
a
half
months
before
the
offense,
that
his
niece
and
nephew
were
scared
of
him,
that
he
could
not
rehabilitate
yourself.
indeed,
i...
i
urge
the
court
to
read
the
cross
examination
of
the
defense
witnesses
at
the
penalty
phase.
it's
short,
it's
narrow,
and
it
focuses
on
this
guy
couldn't
rehabilitate
himself.
this
guy
was
just
paroled
3
and
a
half
months
and
then
goes
and
commits
this
brutal
murder.
and
this
guy's
niece
and
nephew
are
afraid
of
him.
that's
the
context.
also,
the
prior
victim--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--but--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--but,
justice
scalia,
it's
not
just
the
depravity
argument.
the
argument
is
he
learned
a
lesson
to
leave
no
witnesses
behind.
and
the...
the
simplest
answer
to
your
question
is
to
compare
the
argument
in
simmons
to
the
argument
in
this
case.
you
quoted
the
argument
in
simmons
in
your
simmons
dissent.
it
was
the...
this
is
the
prosecutor
in
simmons.
the
defense
in
this
case
as...
the
defense
in
this
case
as
to
the
sentence
is
a
diversion.
it's
putting
the
blame
on
society,
on
his
father,
on
his
grandmother,
on
whoever
else
he
can,
spreading
it
out
to
avoid
his
personal
responsibility.
but
we
are
not
concerned
about
how
he
got
shaped.
we
are
concerned
about
what
to
do
with
him
now
that
he
is
within
our
midst.
and
that
was
the
argument
that
justice
o'connor
and
the
plurality
in
simmons
cited
as
bringing
future
dangerousness
to
the
jury's
attention.
to
put
it--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--future
dangerousness
is...
is
what
we
would
submit
to
the
court.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
when
you
tell
a
jury
that
a
person
is
a
violent
recidivist
who
learns
the
lesson...
he's
a
recidivist.
he's
going
to
commit
more
crimes
if
he's
out.
the
lesson
he
learns
is
when
he
commits
those
more
crimes,
don't
leave
anybody
behind.
i...
i
see
that
as
an
argument
that...
that
is
far
beyond
simmons
itself
as
to
future
dangerousness.
in
future
dangerousness,
justice
scalia,
you...
you
argued
in
the
dissent
that
the
future
dangerousness...
that
what
the
plurality
and
justice
o'connor
construed
as
a
future
dangerousness
argument
could
have
had
another
purpose.
only
in
a
state
like
texas
where
you
have
a
pure
future
dangerousness
argument,
in
every
state
where
you
have
other
aggravators
before
the
jury,
of
course
you
can
construe
it
for
another--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--in
all
of
them
except
pennsylvania,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
it's
a
problem,
but
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
only
in
a
pure
future
dangerousness
state
will
you
have
a
pure
future
dangerousness
argument.
and
just
one
final
comment
on
simmons.
as
a
prosecutor,
if
i'm
putting
on
a
future
dangerousness
case,
i
do
it
just
like
this
prosecutor
do
it.
i
put
on
this
man's
significant
violent
criminal
history.
i
tell
the
jury
the
lessons
he
learned
from
that
history
is
to
be
violent
and
to
not
leave
anybody
behind.
and
i
tell
the
jury
that's
what
he's
like.
that's
what
he
learned
from
his
prior
crimes.
that's
the
message
of
future
dangerousness
you
send
to
the
jury.
that's
the
message
that
this
prosecutor
sent,
exactly
how
you
would
do
it
if
you
were
arguing
future
dangerousness.
you
know
from
the
jury's
question
they
got
that
message.
if
i
may,
i'd
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
yes,
your
honors.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
a
question
about
serendipity.
that's
why
you
conduct
an
investigation.
that's
why
you
look
into
records.
that's
why
this
court
has
said
counsel
has
a
duty
to
conduct
a
thorough,
diligent
investigation.
when
i
go
and
i
look
at
a
prior
conviction
court
file,
i
don't
know
if
it's
going
to
say
that
my
client
is
the
worst
person
on
the
face
of
the
earth
or,
as
in
this
case,
that
it's
going
to
provide
evidence
leading
to
mental
retardation,
significant
mental
disturbance,
and
a
critically
abusive
childhood.
you
do
that
investigation
because
the
prior
conviction
court
file
may
contain
information
that
reduces
the
weight
of
the
aggravating
factor.
in
this
case,
had
counsel
gotten
that
court
file,
as
justice
breyer
summarized,
they
would
have
had
evidence
that
not
only
would
have
reduced
the
weight
of
that
prior
aggravating
factor
that...
but
that
would
have
provided
something
mitigating
for
this
jury.
indeed,
ms.
zapp
quotes
at
page
41
the
1980
aba
standards
that
very
clearly
say,
please,
for
mercy,
do
not
substitute
for
an
actual
thorough
investigation
of
mitigating
evidence
and
presentation
of
mitigating
evidence.
and
all
these
lawyers
ended
up
with
was
an
unconnected
plea
for
mercy
because
they
didn't
take
the
steps
that
reasonable
counsel
take
in
a
capital
case.
i
also
urge
this
court
not
to
be
misled
by...
by
some
commentary
today
about
the
testimony
of
the
lawyers.
at
page
506,
ms.
dantos
very
clearly
says
that
she's
read
the
transcript
of
the
penalty
phase
when
that
prior
conviction
court
file
is
brought
in
by
the
trial
prosecutor.
and
at
that
point,
mr.
charles,
her
co-counsel,
says,
i
object.
i've
never
seen
that
before.
and
the
trial
prosecutor
says,
you
could
have
walked
down
the
hall
and
gotten
it
just
like
i
did.
that's...
that's
what's
she
referring
to
at
page
506.
as
far
as
the
doctors
are
concerned,
i'll
just
read
to
your
honors
just
from
ms.
dantos
herself.
she
has
read
at
pages
473
and
474
what
dr.
gross
had
said.
i
only
looked
at
mental
state
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
is
that
the
purpose
of
the...
is
that
what
the
purpose
of
the
evaluation
was?
yes,
that's
what
it
was
as
to
dr.
gross.
then
at
page
475,
dr.
cooke,
the
second
guy.
did
the
same
evaluation?
yes,
the
same
evaluation.
at
page
476,
dr.
sadoff,
the
third
doctor.
and
is
that
also
what
dr.
sadoff
did?
yes.
page
476.
all
three
of
the
mental
health
professionals
looked
at
mr.
rompilla's
mental
state
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
that's
the
lawyer
herself
saying
what
she
asked
the
doctors
to
do.
and
if
you
look
at--
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
--i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
and
you
should
look
at
those
pages
from
ms.
dantos
and
then
look
at
the
pages
from
dr.
cooke
and
dr.
sadoff.
this
is
dr.
sadoff
at
page
1105.
i
would
have
examined
him,
rompilla,
for
competency
to
stand
trial.
i
would
have
examined
him
for
criminal
responsibilities,
and
i
would
have
examined
him
for
possibility
of
mitigating
circumstances
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
there
is
a
universal
difference
between
that
type
of
mental
health
examination
and
a
life
history
mitigation
examination
that
looks
to
are
there
factors
in
your
life
that
the
jury
should
consider
as
mitigating.
was
there
abuse?
was
there
neglect?
was
there
mistreatment
in
the
home?
was
there
all
the
stuff
that
is
in
the
records
about
this
case
that
these
counsel
did
not
obtain?
not
one
piece
of
paper.
justice
kennedy,
not
even
to
rebut
the
aggravating
factor,
not
even
to
do
that.
a
basic
duty.
even
if
you
put
a
spin
over
mitigation,
i
as
a
lawyer
want
to
rebut
that
aggravating
factor.
the
prosecutor
tells
me
that's
the
file
to
go
look
at.
i
go
look
at
it.
any
reasonable
lawyer,
i
would
think,
would
do
that.
mr.
billy
h.
nolas
your
honors,
thank
you
very
much.
