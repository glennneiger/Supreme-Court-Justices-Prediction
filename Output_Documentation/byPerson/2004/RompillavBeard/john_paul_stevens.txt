justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
rompilla
against
beard.
mr.
nolas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nolas,
are
you
telling
us
that
all
that
information
would
have...
was
in
the
file
that
described
the...
the
criminal
history
that
the
prosecutor
used
in
his
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
didn't
even
look
at
that
file?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
may
reserve
your
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
zapp.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
competence
of
counsel
issue?
one...
i'm...
i'm
very
sympathetic
to
the
problems
of
busy
lawyers
who
have
so
much
to
do
and
they're
preparing
for
a
penalty
hearing.
but
one...
one
aspect
of
this
case...
i
hope
you'll
comment...
and
that
is,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
had
told
the
defense
they
were
going
to
use
certain
aggravating
circumstances,
and
the
files
in
those...
relating
to
those
circumstances
were
available
in
the
courthouse.
and
as
i
understand...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
counsel
did
not
examine
those
files,
and
had
he
examined
those
files,
he
would
have
opened
the
door
to
a
wealth
of
information.
isn't
that
a
fairly
serious
mistake
by
the
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
they...
assume
that's
all
true.
they
thought
they
knew
everything--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
needed
to
know.
but
still,
if
you
say
to
me
i'm
going
to
put
on
certain
exhibits,
a,
b,
and
c,
and
the
defense
says
i'm
not
even
going
to
even
take
a
look
at
them
before
you
put
them
on,
i
find
that
quite
unusual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
ms.
zapp.
ms.
lovitt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
again?
i'm...
i'm
just
afraid
i
missed
it
before.
what
is
your
justification
for
failing
to
look
at
the...
at
the
criminal
files?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
even
if
they
did,
would
it...
you
still
think
it
would
be
prudent
not
even
to
look
at
the
file?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
didn't
have
as
much
as
they
would
have
had
if
they'd
looked
at
the
file.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
i'm
just...
i'm
just
asking
you
whether,
as
a
matter
of
routine
preparation
for
a
contested
hearing,
it
is
not
the
duty
of
counsel
to
take...
at
least
glance
at
the
exhibits
that
the
other
side
is
going
to
offer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
they
did
get
copies
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you,
ms.
lovitt.
mr.
nolas,
you
have
about
4
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
nolas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
submitted.
