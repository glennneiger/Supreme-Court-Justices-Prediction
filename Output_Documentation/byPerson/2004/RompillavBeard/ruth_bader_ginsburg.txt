wasn't
it
the
case
that
those
experts
were
hired
not
primarily
or
even
secondarily
for
mitigation
purposes?
they
were
hired
in
connection
with
the
possibility
of
a
defense
at
the
guilt
stage,
number
one,
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
he
committed
the
crime,
in
which
case
what
he
was
when
he
was
a
child
would
be
irrelevant,
and
number
two,
that
he
was
presently
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
so
they
were
asked
specifically
to
inquire
into
his
present
mental
situation,
and
their
testimony
was
relevant
to
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
so
that's
the
instruction.
naturally
they...
what...
why
are
we
engaging
you?
we're
engaging
you
to
tell
us
do
we
have
a
basis
for
an
insanity
plea,
do
we
have
a
basis
for
an
incompetent
to
stand
trial
plea.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
nolas,
there
were
some
records
that
the
prosecution
sought
and
used.
was
it...
the
records
that
were
in
the
very
courthouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
nothing
special
to
pennsylvania
if
you
know
that
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
use
a
certain
file.

ruth

justice
ruth

wiggins.
justice
ruth
bader

this...
this
prosecutor
also
said,
before
he
got
into
isn't
it
frightening,
i'm
not
asking
you
for
vengeance.
so
if
he's
not
putting
it
on
for
vengeance
or
the
bad
acts
that
he
did,
then
what
else
could
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
there
was
no
problem
in
any
state
but
pennsylvania
because
now
all
of
them...
when
the
jury
wants
to
know
does
life
mean
life,
the
judge
says
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ah,
but
what
immediately
follows...
first
he
said
it's
absolutely
frightening
twice.
but
there
is
one
difference,
one
major
difference,
and
the
difference
is
that
he
has
learned
to
leave
no
witnesses.
that
is
tightly
connected.
he
says
this
is
an
absolutely
frightening
crime,
but
there's
something
more.
he's
learned
not
to
leave
any
witnesses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
thought
they
had...
it
was
reasonable
when
they,
on
their
own,
suspected
that
this
man
might
not
even
be
competent
at
the
moment
to
stand
trial,
that
he...
that
they
might
have
a...
a
basis
for
an
insanity
plea,
that
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
rely
just
on
what
he
told
them
without
looking
at
the
record
that
was
in
the
prosecutor's
hands?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
experts
that
were
hired
primarily
to
say
what
is
his
present
mental
condition,
not
what
happened
in
the
past.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
primary
reason
that
those
experts
were
engaged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
primary
reason.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where...
where
is
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
not
contested
that
in
fact
the
primary
reason
why
these
doctors
were
engaged
was
that
the
defense
attorney
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
a
basis
for
a
plea
of
insanity.
he
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
a
basis
to
claim
that
his
client
was
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
everything
that
was
in
that
file.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
lot
more
than
just
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
in
that
file.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
strickland
was
about
a
strategic
decision
to
pursue
one
kind
of
defense
rather
than
another.
the
government's
brief,
i
must
say,
was
candid
and,
i
think,
useful.
i'm
talking
about
footnote
5
on
page
22
where
you
say
the
federal
public
defenders
in
federal
death
penalty
cases...
they
get
a
mitigation
specialist
and
the
mitigation
specialist,
of
course,
gets
records.
what
records?
exactly
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
gets
records,
birth,
schools,
social
welfare,
employment,
jail,
medical,
and
other
records.
and
here,
not
one
of
those...
not
one...
was
sought.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
about
what
records
to
go
to,
and
here
they
went
to
none.
