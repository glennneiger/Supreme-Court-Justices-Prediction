mr.
christopher
a.
wray
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
no
dispute
that
respondent
here
was
lawfully
stopped
based
on
probable
cause.
there's
also
no
dispute
that
the
entire
stop
took
less
than
9
minutes.
the
question
is
whether
a
second
officer's
use
of
a
drug
dog
to
sniff
outside
of
that
car
during
those
9
minutes
required
some
separate
fourth
amendment
justification.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
i'm
going
to
rely
on...
on
three
distinctions
between
this
case
and
kyllo,
justice
stevens.
the
first
is
that
the
three
points
that
the
court
looked
at
in
kyllo
were:
one,
as
has
already
been
referenced,
the
fact
that
it's
a
home,
the
most
sacred
place
under
the
fourth
amendment;
second,
that
it
revealed
certain
intimate
details;
and
third,
that
that
was
a
technology--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--as...
as
general
madigan
referenced,
there
is
obviously
some
disagreement
within
the
court
on
that
issue,
but
the...
the
fact
was
that
the
technology
in
kyllo
revealed
information
about
heat
in
the
house
which
could
be
thought
to
reveal
intimate
details
about
the
house.
the
third
point
in
kyllo,
which
i
think
justice
scalia
is
referring
to,
is
that
that
was
technology
that
was
not
in
general
public
use.
dogs
have
been
used
by
law
enforcement
across
the
country
since
place
and
before
to
sniff
everything
from--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--not--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--justice
kennedy,
i
cannot,
i
regret
to
say,
tell
you
what
dogs
were
doing
in
1790.
i
can
tell
you...
and
this
is
maybe
a
factual
thing
that
might
be
of
interest
to
the
court...
that
the
dogs
who
train...
who
are
trained
to
alert
to
detect
things...
it's
not
that
they
are
sniffing
things
that
all
dogs
can't
already
smell.
it's
rather
that
they
are
trained
to
let
the
handler
know
that
they've
smelt
whatever
it
is
they've
been
trained
to
smell.
so
the
smells
that
are
coming
out
of
respondent
caballes'
car
are
exposed
to
every
dog.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
we...
our
position
would
still
be,
justice
stevens,
that
as
long
as
the
device
only
revealed,
as
this
does--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--the
absence
or
presence
of
contraband,
it
would
still
be
constitutional.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
we
don't
believe
we
have
to
rely
on
it,
justice
souter.
we
do
believe
that
there
were
three
things
that
were
important
in
kyllo.
the
fact
that
it
was
a
home
was
one
of
those
things.
again,
the...
the
fact
of
a
home,
the
fact
that
it
was
technology
not
in
general
public
use,
and--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--yes,
justice
scalia,
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
that
is
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
we
would...
we
would
submit
this
is
not
a
search
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
both
place
and
edmond...
and
the
jacobsen
case
is
also
significant
because
the
court
said
that
the
reason
this
is
not
a
search,
there
using
the
dog
sniff
by
analogy,
is
because
it
compromises
no
legitimate
privacy
interest.
the
language
of
the
court
in
place
is
significant
because
it
says
that
we
are
aware
of
no
other
investigative
procedure
that
is
so
limited
in
both
the
manner
in
which
the
information
is
obtained
and
in
the
content
of
the
information
revealed.
that
language
goes
not
only
to
why
it's
not
a
fourth
amendment
search
but
why
the
use
of
the
dog
sniff
during
a
probable
cause
traffic
stop
here,
where
it
doesn't
prolong
the
duration,
does
not
transform
an
otherwise
lawful
seizure
into
an
unlawful
one.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
well,
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
whether
the
officer,
the
human
officer,
that
is,
could
be
on
private
property...
i
take
it
from
your
hypothetical,
justice
souter...
in
the
first
place.
but--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--our
position
would
be...
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
the
court
does
not
have
to
resolve
that
issue
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
i
think
you
could,
justice
scalia.
it's
important
to
distinguish--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--we
believe
it
would
be
okay,
justice
o'connor.
it
would
be
important
not
to
use
the
dogs
in
a
way
to
constitute
a
new
seizure
because
in
that
case,
you're
not
talking--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--in
that
instance,
we
believe
that
would
be
acceptable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
we
believe,
justice
kennedy,
that
the...
that
that
context
here
makes
this
an
even
easier
case
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
is,
the
dog
sniff
not
being
a
search
compromising
no
legitimate
privacy
interests
during
the
course
of
a
lawful
probable
cause
stop,
which
we
know
from
atwater...
the
officer
could
have
simply
placed
the
woman
under
full
custodial
arrest
and
taken
her
down
to
jail...
was
not
an
activity
that
transformed
the
seizure
into
an
unlawful
one.
the
illinois
supreme
court's
concern
and
where
we
think
they
got
off
track
was
that
they
were
concerned
that
the
use
of
the
dog
sniff
during
this
9-minute
traffic
stop
was
that
it
transformed
it...
it
used
the
language
that
it
transformed
the
sniff
into
a
drug
investigation.
we
would
submit
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
about
the
reasonableness
of
searches
and
seizures
and
not
about
what
the
scope
of
the
government's
investigation
is.
and
in
that
sense,
the
court
got
off
track.
these...
this
is
a...
this
is
a
means
that
law
enforcement
has
been
using
properly
in
reliance
on
this
court's
decision
in
place,
reinforced
just
4
years
ago
in
edmond,
for
more
than
21
years
to
detect
everything
from
drugs
to
bombs
to
smuggled...
we
have
beagles
in
the
airports
that
smuggle
produce
that's
being
smuggled
in.
dogs
are
used
all
over
the
country
with
great
effectiveness
in
law
enforcement,
and
the...
we...
that
is
a...
a
technique
that
we
want
to
encourage
law
enforcement
to
pursue.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
justice
ginsburg,
there
is
extensive
training
of
law
enforcement
to
use
dogs.
it's
a
multi-week
program
that
requires--
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
--justice
ginsburg,
each
agency
has
different
policies
about
when
they
use
dogs
and
what
purpose
they're
trained
for.
in
this
case,
as
you
heard,
they're
being
used
in
the
context
of
highway
interdiction,
and
so
they're
trained
to
sniff
around
vehicles
specifically.
mr.
christopher
a.
wray
thank
you.
