o'connor
well,
what--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
about
a
house
and...
and
the
use
of
a
dog
to
sniff
around
a
door
access
or
a
house
just
because
the
police
think,
you
know,
it's
possible
this
is
somebody
growing
marijuana
in
the
basement
or
something?
is
that
all
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you...
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
heat
sensor
case
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
like
what?
i
thought
it
was
just
heat?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me.
what
details?
it
is
a
device
that
measures
heat.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
were
a
drug-selling
neighborhood
or
around
a
park
where
drugs
are
frequently
sold,
would
it
be
legitimate
in
your
view
for
the
police
to
take
drug-sniffing
dogs
and
walk
around
the
public
street
where
cars
are
parked
around
that
known
drug-selling
area
and
see
if
they
could
sniff
out
some
contraband
in
the
cars?
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm...
i'm
assuming
parked
cars.
you
haven't
interrupted
anybody.
nobody
is
in
the
car,
parked
on
a
public
street.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
both
place
and
edmond,
opinions
from
this
court,
said
sniffs
are
not
searches.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
want
us
to
reverse
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
edmond
also
said
it's
not
a
search.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
the
stop
of
the
cars
in
that
case
that
caused
the
result.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
fine.
we
had
a
context
there
where
we
supported
it,
but
in
the
process
said
the
sniff,
the
dog
sniff,
was
not
a
search.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
want
us
to
say
something
else
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
context
here
was
a
legitimate
traffic
stop.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
dog
sniff
is
not
a
search.
what
difference
does
it
make?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this...
the
trunk
of
the
car
didn't
have
to
be
opened
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle
did
not
have
to
be
opened
here.
you're
talking
about
a
dog
sniffing
on
the
exterior
of
the
vehicle
that
was
legitimately
stopped
for
a
traffic
violation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it
matter
if,
for
instance,
in
today's
world
on
capitol
hill
we're
concerned
about
terrorist
attacks.
what
if
the
dog
is
trained
to
alert
to
explosives?
now,
can
the
police
just
decide
they're
going
to
sniff
any
car
that's
parked
on
capitol
hill?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes
or
no,
in
your
view.
the
purpose
is
to
disclose
potential
explosives
in
a
parked
vehicle.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wherever
it
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
also
have
an
opinion
to
announce
in
03-923,
illinois
versus
caballes
that
was
authored
by
justice
stevens.
this
is
a
case
that
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
in
the
opinion,
authored
by
justice
stevens,
we
answer
a
narrow
question,
whether
the
fourth
amendment
requires
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
to
justify
using
a
drug
detection
dog
to
sniff
a
vehicle
during
a
legitimate
traffic
stop.
an
illinois
state
trooper
stopped
petitioner
caballes
for
speeding
on
an
interstate
highway.
when
the
officer
radioed
the
police
dispatcher
to
report
the
traffic
stop,
a
member
of
the
state’s
drug
interdiction
team
overheard
the
transmission
and
drove
to
the
scene
along
with
his
narcotics-detection
dog.
on
arrival
and
while
the
first
trooper
was
writing
the
warning
ticket
for
speeding,
the
drug
interdiction
officer
walked
the
dog
around
caballes’
car,
the
dog
alerted
at
the
trunk
prompting
the
officers
to
open
the
trunk
where
they
discovered
marijuana.
caballes
was
arrested
and
charged
with
a
narcotics
offense.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
the
seized
evidence.
the
court
found
no
fourth
amendment
violation
because
the
officers
did
not
unnecessarily
prolong
the
traffic
stop
in
order
to
conduct
the
dog
sniff
and
because
the
particular
dog
sniff
was
sufficiently
reliable
to
establishe
probable
cause
to
search
the
trunk.
the
illinois
supreme
court
reversed.
in
its
view
the
use
of
a
narcotics-detection
cog
converted
the
citizen
police
encounter
from
a
lawful
traffic
stop
into
a
drug
investigation
and
because
the
shifting
purpose
was
not
supported
by
any
reasonable
suspicion
of
drug
activity,
it
was
unlawful.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
illinois
supreme
court’s
holding.
we
now
vacate
and
remand.
in
our
view,
conducting
a
dog
sniff
would
not
change
the
character
of
a
lawful
traffic
stop
unless
the
dog
sniffs
itself
infringed
unconstitutionally
protected
privacy
interest.
our
cases
made
clear
that
it
did
not.
to
fall
within
the
purviews
of
the
fourth
amendment,
police
conduct
must
compromise
a
legitimate,
interest
in
privacy.
because
a
canine
sniffs
by
a
well-trained
drug
detection
dog
does
not
itself
reveal
noncontraband
items
and
because
any
interest
in
possessing
contraband
cannot
be
deemed
legitimate,
the
use
of
a
properly
trained
drug
detection
dog
during
a
lawful
traffic
stop
will
not
generally
implicate
legitimate
privacy
interest.
in
this
case
the
traffic
stop
was
lawful.
it
was
not
prolonged
beyond
the
time
reasonably
required
to
issue
a
warning
ticket.
in
these
circumstances,
a
dog
sniff
that
only
reveals
the
presence
of
the
substance
no
individual
has
any
right
to
possess
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
vacated.
the
case
is
remanded
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
court’s
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
souter
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
