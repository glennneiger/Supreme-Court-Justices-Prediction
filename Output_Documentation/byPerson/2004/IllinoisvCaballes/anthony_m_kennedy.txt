justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
answered
one
of
the
earlier
questions
about
the
possible
intrusiveness
of
dogs
everywhere
by
saying,
well,
you
don't
have
a
privacy
interest
in
contraband,
but
that's
never
true.
you
don't
have
a
privacy
interest
in
the
murder
victim's
body,
but
you
still
have
to
have
a
warrant
to
go
in
and
get
it.
so
that...
that
just
doesn't
work
unless
i
missed
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
you
have
a
privacy
interest
in
your
person
and
in
your
place,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
so
that
seems
to
me
that
that
just
doesn't
help
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
because
of
the
nature
of
the
place
being
searched
not
because
of
the
nature
of
what
you're
searching
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
just
can't
be
that...
so
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
a
privacy
interest
in
contraband,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me...
i...
i
don't
think
you
need
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that
other
than
justice
scalia's
speculation
about
how
this--
[laughter]
--how
his
kyllo
case
might
have
been
written?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
we...
we
don't
have
the
probable
cause
question
before
us,
do
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
you
think
if
this
were
a
house,
that
the
kyllo
case
would
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
come
here--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
you
come
here
having
researched
all
about
dogs
in
1790?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you...
you
give
no
significance
to
the
fact
that
this
dog
sniff
was
in
the
course
of
a
lawful
stop
where
the
citizen's
rights
had
already
been
curtailed
to
a
significant
extent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
a
policeman
who
smells
marijuana
coming
out
of
a
car
or
a
residence.
he's
walking
down
the
street,
public
street,
and
he
smells
marijuana.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
never--
