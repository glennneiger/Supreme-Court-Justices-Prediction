justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
again
in
your
view
is
the
best
distinction
from
kyllo?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was...
and
what
was
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that
isn't
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
once
you
say
that,
you
realize
that
there
are
billions
and
billions
of
searches
that
go
on
every
day
that
the
police
don't
have
to
justify
at
all.
they
just
look
around.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay?
there
are
billions
of
them.
so
the
real
question
is
do
they
have
to
give
a
justification
for
this.
and
the
argument
that
they
don't
is
simply
that
it's
not
in
the
person's
house.
when
you
go
out
in
a
public
place,
even
in
your
car,
you
might
run
into
people
or
animals
with
sharp
noses.
and
a
lot
of
them
can
detect
marijuana.
and
you
know,
maybe
it's
a
limburger
cheese.
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
but
people
are
sniffing
things
that
they
don't
sniff
through
windows
into
your
house,
but
they
do
get
odors
in
your
car
on
the
street.
so
this
is
the
kind
of
search.
yes,
it's
a
search,
but
one
that
the
police
don't
have
to
justify.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it's
a
specific
investigative
tool
when
i
put
on
my
glasses
to
look
through
a
window.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
why
it
has
to...
why
that
matters
if
in
fact
all...
if
you
go
into
a
car,
a
police
car,
and
you
have...
drive
through
the
neighborhood
and
look
around,
you
are
using
a
specific
investigative
tool,
the
police
car,
to
look
around
and
find
out
what's
going
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
in
my
own
mind
it's
not
a
question
of
the
tools.
it's
a
question
of
the
expectation
of
privacy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
still
want
to
go
back
to
my
question
because
i
think
you
may
have
an
answer
to
it
and
i
want
to
focus
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
to
focus
you
on
the
question.
i
think
what
you're
doing,
which
is
a
reasonable
thing
to
do,
but
it
isn't
my
approach,
look
to
the
english
definition
of
search.
i
say
forget
that.
let's
look
to
the
fourth
amendment
because
there
are
a
whole
range
of
searches
that
don't
even
fall
within
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
need
a
justification.
and
i
take
place
as
saying
that
dog
sniffs
is
one
of
those,
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
use
the
word
english
search.
so
i
want
to
know
why
it
is
that
this
dog
search
is
one
of
the
ones
that's
a
fourth
amendment
search,
i.e.,
one
of
the
ones
that
requires
a
justification
in
terms
of
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
about,
privacy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that
isn't...
i
take
it
you
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
policeman
himself
taking
a
sniff?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
great
limburger
cheese
robbery.
[laughter]
he
stopped
the
car
and
he
walks
around.
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
plain--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so...
so
what
you're
saying
is...
and
this
must
tie
back
to
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
all
right?
because
it's
okay
for
the
policeman
to
do
it,
and
it's
okay
for
dogs
to
do
it
in
the
bus
station,
and
it's
okay
to
use
a
dog
not
in
the
bus
station
with
a
car
if
in
fact
you
actually
are
going
to
put
him
under
arrest,
although
here
you
had
probable
cause
to
do
so,
i
take
it.
and
now
you
have
to
draw
a
pretty
fine
line.
but
it's
not
okay
where
it's
not
the
bus
station,
but
it
is
the
car
and
in
fact
the
dog
is
doing
the
sniffing...
and
there
are
a
lot
of
dogs
around
that
can
sniff...
and
you
did
have
probable
cause
but
you
didn't
say
it.
and
in
face
of
justice
o'connor's
case
which
said
that...
you
see.
well,
i
mean,
this
is...
this
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
you
couldn't
draw
that
line,
but
i'm
saying
it's
pretty
tough
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
i'm
right?
am
i...
i
mean,
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you're
going
to
draw
the...
well,
i
don't
want
you
to
repeat
yourself
necessarily.
