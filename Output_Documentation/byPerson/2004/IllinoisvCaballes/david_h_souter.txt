justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've
held
that
it's
certainly
not
a...
a
full-blown
search.
it's
not
a
search
in
the
classic
sense,
but
a
terry
stop
isn't
an
arrest
in...
in
the
classic
sense
either.
we...
we
have
said
that
that
is
a
kind
of
seizure.
why
do...
i
think
your...
your
argument
assumes
that
this
for...
for
purposes
of
search
analogies
that
something
is
either
a...
a
full-dress
search
or
it's
not
a
search
at
all.
why
isn't
there
a...
a
possibility
of...
of
a
kind
of
middle
ground
searches
just
as
there
is
on
seizures?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i...
i
can...
i
can
just
imagine
the
problems,
but
i
mean,
what...
i
think
what's...
what
the...
what's
bothering
me
about
the
case
is
that
if
we
persist
in...
in
saying
that...
that
it's...
that
it's
an
either
and
or
question
with
no
question
with
no
possible
gradation,
then
i
assume
nothing
prevents
the
police
from
taking
the
dogs
through
every
municipal
garage
in
the
united
states
and
i
suppose
there's
nothing
that
prevents
the
police
from
taking
the
dogs
up
to
any
homeowner's
door,
ringing
the
bell,
and
seeing
if
the
dog
gets
a
sniff
of
something
when
the
door
is
opened.
we're...
we're
opening
rather
a...
a
large
vista
for...
for
dog
intrusions,
and...
and
that's
what's...
that's
what's
bothering
me.
why...
why
should
we...
why
should
we
open
that
vista
if
there
is
a
possibility
of
a...
of
a
middle
ground
that
would
prevent
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
in...
in
discussing
the...
the
answer
to
the...
the
kyllo
issue,
you...
you
place
an
emphasis
on
the
protection
given
to
a
house.
would
you
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
and
my
earlier
example?
is
it
still
your
answer
that
the
police
can
walk
dogs
around
the
foundation
of
the
house
or
take
a
dog
to
the
front
door
and
ring
the
bell
and
see
what
it...
what
it
sniffs
when
the
door
is
opened--
justice
david
h.
souter
--without
there
being
a
search
and
hence
no
fourth
amendment
concern?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
then...
then
the...
then
there
is
no
significance
in
the
house.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
does...
when
does
it
occur?
i
mean,
if...
if...
first
you
say
the...
the
house
is...
is
a
matter
of
significance
for
kyllo
analysis.
we're
trying
to
draw
a
distinction,
if
there
is
one,
between
kyllo
and
this,
and
you
say
they
can
go
to
the
house.
they
can
sniff
the
foundations.
they
can
go
to
the
front
door,
et
cetera.
i
don't
see
that
the
house,
in
fact,
is
functioning
as
a
distinction
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
realize
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
your
basic
argument,
if
i
understand
it,
is
there
is
simply
no
search
here,
and
because
there
is
no
search
here,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you're
dealing
with
a
house
or
a
parking
lot
or
a
car
on
the
road.
no
search
is
no
search.
so
for
purposes
of...
if
i...
i
want
to
understand
your
case,
and
as
i
understand
it,
for
purposes
of
your
case,
there
is
no
significance
in
the
house
because
there
doesn't
have
to
be.
the
question
doesn't
arise
because
there's
no
search.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
rely
on
the...
in...
in
distinguishing
kyllo,
why
do
you
rely
on
the
house
if
there's
no
search?
why
do
you
have
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
house
involved
there?
you...
you
listed
that
as
one
of
your
three
distinctions.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
your...
is...
is
it...
i
understand
it
to
be
your
position
that
there
simply
is
no
search
here.
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it's
a
dog
sniff.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
do
you...
do
you
think
it's...
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
if
the
police
take
dogs
simply
onto
private
property
to
sniff
the
foundations
of
houses,
if
they
take
dogs
to
the
front
door
and
ring
the
bell
so
that
they
hope
the
door
will
open,
that
there
is...
there
is
no
compromise
of
a
privacy
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
after
katz
doesn't...
doesn't
depend
on
trespass,
and...
and
you
have
said
up
to
this
point
that
there
is
no
search.
and
then
you
have
quite
rightly
said
that
we
have
had
as
a
consideration
in
our
minds
analytically
whether
it's
fair
to
say
that
what
the
police
were
doing
involved
any
compromise
of
a
privacy
interest.
so
i'm
assuming...
i'm
assuming
that
the
police
can
at
least
get
to
the
foundation
with
a
dog
and
they
can
certainly
walk
up
to
the
front
door
and
ring
the
bell.
and
if
they
do
that
with
a
dog,
for
the
purpose
of
letting
the
dog
sniff
and
alert,
if
there's
anything
to
alert
to,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
there
is
no
compromise
of
the
privacy
interests
of
the
people
who
own
the
house?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
that
argument
is
take
the...
take
the
case
of...
of
the
arrestable
offense
in
which
it
is
undoubtedly
the
case
that
although
the
police
don't
normally
arrest,
they...
they
can.
your...
if
i
understand
your
argument,
you're
saying
if
they,
in
fact,
do
arrest,
they
may
then
take
the
dog
around
the
car,
and
indeed,
i
presume
you
would
agree,
they
could
make
an
inventory
search
because
they've
got
to
protect
themselves
against
claims
that
they
lost
property
and
so
on.
so
there's
no
question
that
in
that
case,
as...
as
you
have
argued
it,
they
could
make
a
full-blown
search
and...
and
certainly
can
use
the
dog.
but
if
they
choose
not
to
arrest
on
the
highway,
they
can't.
my
problem
is
how
can
you
say
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
case
number
two
if
you
admit
that
the
police
can
search
in
case
number
one.
how
does
that
affect
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
is...
why...
why
don't
you
simply
say,
look...
have
a
very
simple
line.
if
they
can
arrest,
they
can
sniff.
if
they
can't
arrest,
they
can't
sniff
without
individualized
suspicion
going
to
drugs
or
whatever.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what...
what
is
the
answer
to
the
reasonable
expectation
to
privacy
question
in
that
case?
isn't
your
expectation
of
privacy
identical,
whatever
it
may
be,
or
isn't
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
identical,
whatever
that
may
be,
without
regard
to
the
discretionary
decision
of
the
officer
to
arrest
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying
that
the...
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
depends
upon
the
officer's
discretionary
judgment
whether
or
not
to
arrest.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
