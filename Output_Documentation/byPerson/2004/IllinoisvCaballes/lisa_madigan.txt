ms.
lisa
madigan
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
made
clear
on
several
occasions,
including
21
years
ago
in
place
and
4
years
ago
in
edmond,
that
a
sniff
by
a
drug-detection
dog
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
search,
and
if
something
is
neither
a
search
nor
a
seizure,
then
it
requires
no
fourth
amendment
justification.
ms.
lisa
madigan
well,
this
court
made
clear
in
arizona
v.
hicks
that
it
did
not
want
to
go
down
the
road
of
creating
something
known
as
a
quasi-search
so
that
courts
and
police
officers
would
be
in
the
position
of
trying
to
determine
whether
or
not
something
was
a
search
or
not.
ms.
lisa
madigan
well,
i
would
start
with
the
reality
that
dog
sniffs
by
their
very
nature,
as
this
court
recognized
in
both
place
and
edmond,
are
very
unique
both
in
terms
of
the
manner
in
which
the
sniff
is
conducted,
as
well
as
the
content
of...
of
the
information
that
the
sniff
reveals,
so
that
a
dog
sniff
is
only
going
to
be
able
to
reveal
the
presence
or
absence
of
contraband.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
individuals
have
no
privacy
interest
in
the
possession
of
contraband.
ms.
lisa
madigan
yes.
because
a
sniff
is
not
a
search,
a
police
officer
would
be
able
to
take
a
narcotics-detection
dog
down
the
street
with
him
or
her.
i
can
tell
you
that
because
of
the
limited
resources...
and
this
is
a
point
brought
up
in
the
illinois
association
of
chiefs
of
police
amicus
brief...
that
that
is
not
likely
to
occur.
in
addition,
i
can
also
tell
you
that
in
the
state
of
illinois,
the
illinois
state
police
do
not
train
their
dogs
nor
do
they
use
their
dogs
on
people.
they
only
use
them
on
objects.
but
yes,
in
answer
to
both
of
your
questions,
because
a
dog
sniff
does
not
constitute
a
search,
dogs
could
be
used
to
walk
down
streets.
they
could,
hypothetically,
be
used
in
parking
lots,
and
at
times
they
are
used
in
parking
lots.
ms.
lisa
madigan
yes,
they
are.
ms.
lisa
madigan
i
agree.
ms.
lisa
madigan
in
the
present
case,
mr.
caballes
was
traveling
from
las
vegas,
nevada
apparently
on
his
way
to
chicago,
illinois.
he
was
pulled
over
for
speeding.
another
officer
overheard
when
master
sergeant
gillette
called
in
to
dispatch
that
he
effected--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--you
may.
ms.
lisa
madigan
yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
ms.
lisa
madigan
we
always
like
to
have
you
in
illinois.
obviously,
the
illinois
state
police
have
the
ability
to
pull
somebody
over
whether
they're
going
1
mile
over
the
speed
limit
or
26
miles
over
the
speed
limit,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
they
were
looking
for
mr.
caballes
as
he
was
traveling
eastbound
on
i-80
towards
chicago.
ms.
lisa
madigan
yes.
it
was
approximately
5:10
p.m.--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--you
do
not
have
a
privacy
interest
in
contraband,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
jacobsen
case.
ms.
lisa
madigan
well,
there
is
a
distinction
that's
made
in
terms
of
fourth
amendment
protections
that
are
given
to
homes
and
people
versus
cars.
ever
since
the
carroll
case,
it
has
been
recognized
that
a
warrantless
search
of
a
car
can
be
done
if
they
found
probable
cause.
ms.
lisa
madigan
correct.
ms.
lisa
madigan
i...
i
plan
on
continuing
to
use
it.
ms.
lisa
madigan
i
would
hope
the
case
would
come
out
differently
than--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--i
would
argue
that,
yes,
it
is
all
right
to
walk
a
dog
around
a
house,
but
then
as
justice--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--the
thermal
imager
that
was
used
in
the
kyllo
case
was
able
to
reveal
intimate
details
of
the
house.
a
dog
sniff
is
only
going
to
reveal
the
presence
or
absence
of
contraband,
and
because
of
that,
that's
where
we
suddenly
get
into
the
tension
between
kyllo
and
place
and--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--well,
then
you
would
end
up
in
a
situation
as
to
whether
or
not
an
officer
had
probable
cause
when
a
dog,
in
fact,
alerted.
if
he
was
alerting
to
the
presence
of
perfume
as
opposed
to
narcotics,
there--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--well,
they're
very
well
trained
dogs.
in
fact,
in
the
state
of
illinois,
the
dogs
and
their
handlers
go
through
320
hours
of
training,
and
they're
specifically
trained
to
only
alert
to
narcotics.
ms.
lisa
madigan
one
of
the
things
that
does
take
place
during
the
training
of
these
narcotics-detection
dogs
is
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
alerting
to
things
that
are
not
narcotics
or...
i
don't
know
exactly
how
the
explosive
training
is
conducted
because
we
don't
train
our
dogs
in
illinois
for
explosives,
but
they
purposely
train
them
on
narcotics
not
to
alert
to
plastic
wrap
that
is
frequently
the
container
used
for
narcotics,
not--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--it
depends.
the
analysis
would
be
different
if
the
dog
was
known
to
or
had
been
trained
to
actually
alert
to
the
non-contraband.
ms.
lisa
madigan
well,
it
would
actually
go
to
whether
or
not
that
dog
provided...
that
dog's
alert
provided
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
search.
ms.
lisa
madigan
you
do
not
have
the
probable
cause
question
before
you.
this
dog
was
determined
to
be
reliable
by
the
trial
court
and
the
illinois
appellate
court,
and
it
was
not
part
of
the
illinois
supreme
court's
decision.
ms.
lisa
madigan
two
things.
one,
the
thermal
imager
used
in
kyllo
was
able
to
reveal
intimate
details
that
individuals--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--there
was
some
disagreement
on
the
court
about
exactly
what
it
revealed,
but
in
terms
of
intimate
details,
it
then
allowed
somebody--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--because
it
could
measure
heat,
it
could
also
potentially
determine
when
somebody
was
taking
a
bath,
taking
a
sauna,
and
doing
other
intimate
things
in
the
house.
ms.
lisa
madigan
the
second
one
would
be
the
distinction
between
houses
and
cars
and
the
protections
that
houses
are
given
under
the
fourth
amendment,
which
are
far
greater
than
the
protections
that
people
have
in
their
cars.
ms.
lisa
madigan
if
this
were
a
house
in
the
situation,
it
would
certainly
bring
out
the
tension
between
kyllo
and
place--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--i
would
argue
that.
so
if
there
was
an
ability
to
create
a...
a
mechanical
dog,
for
instance,
we
would
again
say
that
the
use
of
a
mechanical
dog
sniff
would
not
be
a
search
and
therefore
would
not--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--you
are
correct.
ms.
lisa
madigan
i
would--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--yes,
justice
souter,
i
would
say
that
that
is
possible
because
the
sniff
itself
is
not
a
search
and
it
only
reveals
the
presence
or
absence
of
contraband,
which
is
something
that
the
individual
does
not
have
privacy
expectations--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--there
is
potentially
significance
in
the
house
because
the--
ms.
lisa
madigan
--this
court's
precedents
have
shown
us
that
in
fact
fourth
amendment
protections
are
higher
in
the
home
than
they
are
in
the
car.
ms.
lisa
madigan
justice
souter,
that
is
absolutely
correct.
a
search,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned...
and
i
believe
it's
based
on
the
precedents
of
this
court...
is
a
sniff
is
not
a
search,
and
therefore
it
requires
no
fourth
amendment
justification.
ms.
lisa
madigan
there
are
in
this
country
millions
of
dogs,
many
of
the
types
of
dogs
that
are
used
by
narcotics
detection
teams,
such
as
labrador
retrievers
and
shepherds,
are
identical
to
the
pets
that
people
own.
we
encounter
them
in
the
parks,
on
the
streets,
and
i
would
contend
that
an
officer
cannot
be
in
the
position
of
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individual
that
he
encounters
is
going
to
be
frightened
by
the
dog.
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
lisa
madigan
thank
you.
ms.
lisa
madigan
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
let
me
make
three
brief
points.
number
one,
justice
ginsburg
asked
a
question
about
something
that
was
in
the
respondent's
brief,
whether
or
not
it
made
a
difference
if
a
dog
was
with
master
sergeant
gillette
when
he
initiated
the
stop
or
if
the
dog
was
later
brought,
as
was
the
case
here,
by
trooper
graham.
really
what
mr.
caballes
is
arguing
for
here
is
an
inadvertence
requirement
which
this
court
very
clearly
held
in
horton,
there
is
no
such
requirement
of
inadvertence.
and
so
a
law
officer,
if
they
are
at
a
lawful
vantage
point,
do
have
the
ability
to
detect
incriminating
facts.
that
is
not
something
that
has
to
occur
inadvertently.
it
can
happen
intentionally.
second,
justice
scalia
asked
a
question
about
plain
view,
and
similar
to
plain
view,
a
dog
sniff
does
not
effect
an
incremental
search
or
seizure.
and
therefore,
similar
to
plain
view,
a
dog
sniff
does
not
require
fourth
amendment
justification.
and
let
me
finally
acknowledge
something
that
justice
souter
brought
up,
which
is
whether
or
not,
by
walking
a
dog
around
a
house,
you
in
fact
would
have
a
search.
let
me...
now,
that
is
certainly
a
closer
case
than
whether
walking
a
dog
around
a
car
constitutes
a
search,
which
we
say
is
not.
but
ultimately
you
would
reach
a
similar
result
because
the
principle
is
not
going
to
extend
to
cars
in
the
same
manner
in...
in
kyllo
as
the
thermal
imager
did.
finally,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
be
reversed.
ms.
lisa
madigan
thank
you.
