justice
ruth
bader

does
that
imply
that
your
answer
is
yes
to
the
question?
if
we
say,
as
you
urge,
a
dog
sniff
is
not
a
search,
then
the
police
are
free
to
parade
up
and
down
every
street
in
the
country
with
dogs
sniffing
car
trunks.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
could
characterize
those
episodes
under
the,
quote,
special
needs
doctrine.
i
mean,
we
are
exposed
to
searches
at
airports
that
we
would
not
put
up
with
walking
up
and
down
an
ordinary
street.
so
the
dogs
at
the
terminals
one
expects
nowadays.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there
was
a
reference
to
my
lady's
bath
in
the
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
there's
no
disturbance
of
one's
privacy
and
so
that
distinguishes
the
dog
sniff
from
some
other
governmental
intrusions.
but
dogs
can
be
frightening,
humiliating.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
some
association
with
the
idea
that
i
have
a
right
to
be
let
alone
by
my
government
and
having
a
large
dog
circle
my
car.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there...
are
there
any
manuals
for
law
enforcement
officers
with
respect
to
the
time
and
place
of
using
dogs,
or
it's
just
open
season?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
mean
the
training
to
make
the
dog
alert
properly.
how
the
police
will
use
them,
when,
under
what
circumstances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
said
it's
to
find
out
if
there's
any
contraband.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
answer
was
they
are
at
liberty...
the
police
are
at
liberty
to
use
dogs
to
find
contraband.
and
your...
illinois
i
think
was
very
candid
with
the
court
in
saying
we
have
taken
from
your
decisions
that
a
dog
sniff
is
not
a
search.
so
anything
else
is
a
matter
of
police
policy.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
something
you
said
in...
in
your
brief
that
i
thought
was
unclear.
so
may
i
ask
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
officer
gillette,
the
one
who
did
the
arrest
for
speeding,
had
a
dog
in
the
back
of
his
car,
instead
of
having
the
second
officer
come
with
the
dog,
would
it
have
been
permissible?
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
it
would
be
a
different
situation
if
the
dog
was
already
there
when
the
car
stopped.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
he
didn't,
but
i'm
asking
you
to
imagine
that
he
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
would
like
to
take
this
scenario
as
it
is
except
that
when
the
officer
gets
out
of
the
car,
his
dog
comes
with
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
very...
make
no
other
changes
except
that
gillette
has
the
dog
and
gillette
with
the
dog
go
to
mr.
caballes'
car.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
i'm--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
you
meant
in
your
brief
when
you
said
if
the
dog
had
been
in
gillette's
car
when
gillette
stopped
caballes,
the
situation
would
have
been
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
it
really
makes
no
difference
whether
it
was
gillette
who
had
the
dog
in
his
car
or
whether
the
dispatcher
called
another
officer
who
had
the
dog.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't...
so
you're
retracting
that.
you,
i
think,
were
asked
but
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
you
fully
answered.
suppose
the
police,
as
atwater
would
allow,
arrested,
made
a
full
arrest
of
caballes,
and
then
they
impound
his
car.
in
the
place
where
they
put
it,
couldn't
they
have
a
dog
go
around
the
car
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
could
have.
he
could
have.
i
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is...
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
the
officer
change
his
mind?
i
mean,
he...
he
did
say
i'm
just
going
to
give
you
a
citation,
and
then
he
said,
mind
if
i
search
your
car.
this
is
before
the...
the
dog
showed
up.
and
suppose
the
person
who
had
been
speeding
said,
yes,
i
mind.
don't
search
my
car.
and
then
the
police
said,
well,
in
that
case
i'm
going
to
arrest
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
had
already
drawn
the
line
at
a
different
place
than
justice
breyer
suggested
because
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
you
said
if
it...
if
it
were
going
into
the
bus
terminal
just
to
sniff
for
narcotics,
unlike
explosives,
it
would
be
an
impermissible
search.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be--
