justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
used.
i
mean,
we
don't
have
to
make
it
up.
from
cases
we've
had
here,
we
know
that
they're
used
in
places
like
bus
depots
to...
to
sniff
luggage
that...
that
passengers
have
carried
through
on...
on
buses.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
republic
seems
to
have
survived.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
these
aren't
sniffs
for...
for
explosives.
these
are
sniffs
for
drugs
and...
and
these...
these
are
not
buses
that
are
coming
in
from
france.
they're
coming
in
from
one
american
city
to
another.
and...
and
there's
no
more
need
in...
in
that
case
than
there
was
in
this
case.
it
was
just
a
good...
a
good
place
to
find
criminals
who
were
carrying
unlawful
drugs.
justice
antonin
scalia
inadvertently.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
not
necessarily.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
should
use
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you...
are
you
sure
that
kyllo,
you
know,
the...
the
imaging
case,
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
if
the
only
thing...
the
only
thing...
that
the
imaging
could
pick
out
is
not
any
of
the
other
private
activities
in
the
home,
but
the
only
thing
it
could
possibly
discern
is
a
dead
body
with
a
knife
through
the
heart?
are
you
sure
the
case
would
have
come
out
the
same
way?
i'm
not
at
all
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
if
that
happened
a
large
percentage
of
the
time.
i
mean,
surely
you'd
concede
that
the
search
is
unreasonable
if,
for
every...
every
one
time,
you...
you
make
somebody
open
his
bag
because
the
dog
actually
smells
narcotics,
99
times
you
make
somebody
open
his
bag
because
he
has
apples
in
it.
i
mean,
wouldn't
that
go
to
the
reasonableness
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
nice
turn
of
phrase,
as
i
recall.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
there...
didn't
kyllo...
wasn't
what...
what
the
court
was
worried
about
in
kyllo
not
just
the
relatively
crude
heat
imaging
that
existed
in
the
case
before
it,
but
the
prospect
of
more
and
more
sophisticated
heat
imaging
which...
which
we
had
evidence
was
already
in
development
that
would
enable
you
to
see
people
moving
around
a
room?
i
thought
the
case
referred
to
that.
now,
are
we
going
to
have
more
and
more...
what's
going
to
happen
with
dogs?
i...
i
can't
imagine
that...
that
this
thing
is
going
anywhere
other
than
smelling
narcotics
and
smelling
bombs.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
with...
with
general
madigan
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the...
the
dog
is
a...
is
a
mechanical
instrument
or
not?
do
you
agree
it
makes
no
difference?
i
thought
that
one
of
the...
one
of
the
points
in...
in
the
imaging
case
was
that
this
was
a
new
technology
which
didn't
exist
and
that
although
the
ordinary
rules
in
1791
was
that
there
was
no
search
unless...
you
know,
unless
you
enter
the
house
or
unless
you...
you
physically
intrude
upon
the
person's...
at
least
the
person's
clothes,
we
made
an
exception
to
that
rule
because
of
this
new
technology
that
enabled
you
to
find
out
things
without
having
to
intrude
into
the
home
or
into
the
person.
now,
but...
but
this
is
not
a
new
technology.
this
is
a
dog
and...
and
they
had
that
ability
in
1791
just
as
they
had
it
today.
and
the
rule
that
when
there's
no
intrusion,
there's
no
search...
there's
no
reason
to
depart
from
that
rule
with
respect
to
a
dog
although
there
would
be
with
respect
to
some
sophisticated
new
technology
that
would
enable
you
to
find
out
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
shouldn't...
you
shouldn't
assume
that...
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
canine
makes
no
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
that,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
didn't
go
to
whether
it
was
a
search
or
seizure.
i
think
it
goes
to
whether
it
was
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure.
don't
you
think
so?
that
what...
what
might
be
unreasonable
with
respect
to
a
home
would
not
be
unreasonable
with
respect
to
a
suitcase?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
we
could
separate
the
home
from
the...
from
what
happened
here
and
still
validate
the
search
here
if
we
held
that
it
was
a
search,
but
was
a
reasonable
one
since
all
you
find
is
that
the
person
was
carrying
contraband.
it's
the
only
thing
that's
disclosed.
whereas,
if
you...
if
you
did
the
same
thing
with...
with
regard
to
a
house,
which
is
a
more
sacrosanct
part
of
one's
privacy,
it
might
be
an
unreasonable
search.
we...
we
could
reach
that
result
if
we
wanted
to,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
do
you
say
that?
i
mean,
is...
is
anything
that
i
observe
a
search?
i
mean,
suppose
i...
i'm
a
policeman
and...
and
i'm
looking
out
for,
i
don't
know,
people
with
a
nervous
tic
because
i
think
that
that
might
be
somebody
who's
about
to
commit
a
crime
or
has
committed
a
crime.
have
i
searched
that
person
because
i...
i
observe
something
external?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
no
difference
between
an
investigation
and
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it
seems
to
me
your
brief
and...
and
your
statement
here
both
seem
to
assume
that
there's
a
search
whenever
the
police
investigate.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
so.
they...
one
can
investigate
without
searching.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
a
policeman
follows
me
around.
he
just...
just
follows
me
around,
observing
with
his...
with
plain
eyes.
now,
is
that
a
search?
does
he
need
probable
cause
to
do
that?
now,
he's
wasting
his
time
and
he's
wasting
public
money
and
maybe
he
should
get
fired
for
doing
it,
if
he
has
no
reason
to
follow
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe...
maybe
i'd
have
a
harassment
action
against
him
if
he
does
it,
you
know,
blatantly.
but
is
that
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so...
so
the
mere
fact
that
one
is
in
investigating
something
doesn't
make
it
a
search.
what
does
make
it
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fact
that
you
find
out
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it
would
be
better
if
he
hadn't
been
stopped?
if...
if
they
just...
just
randomly
walked
up
to
somebody
who
was
going
through
a
toll
booth
and
had
the
dog
sniff
the
car,
you
think
that
would
be
a
better
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
allowing
it
than...
than
yours?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
does
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
bad?
would
it
be
bad
if
that's
what
he
did?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
meczyk,
i
assume
that
your
answer
to
whether
it's
lawful
to
have
a...
a
dog
at
a
bus
depot
just
to
sniff
the
bags
of
people
who
were
coming
off,
without
stopping
them,
but
just...
just
to
have
the
dogs
there,
that's
unlawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
narcotics,
not
for
bombs,
not
for...
just...
just
for
narcotics.
the
police
think,
you
know,
a
lot
of
narcotics
goes
on
interstate
buses.
we're
going
to
put
a
dog
in
the
bus
depot.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
is
the
road,
for
pete's
sake.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's...
that's
what
i
think
you
should
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
think
it's
worse
if...
if
you're
subjected
to
it
without
having
committed
any
violation
at
all.
every
time
i
travel
abroad
and
come
back
into
the
country,
customs
officers
have
dogs
and...
and
they
parade
the
dogs
through...
through
the
baggage
terminal.
do...
do
i
feel
offended
by
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
a
public
safety
matter.
they're...
they're
not
smelling
for
bombs.
they're...
they're
smelling
for
contraband.
and
according
to
you,
that
is
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
a
bus
station
is
different,
though.
