justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
illinois
against
caballes.
general
madigan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt,
general
madigan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
pulled
over
for
speeding
at
71
miles
an
hour
in
a
65
mile
an
hour
zone
on
i-80.
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
know
in
advance
that
he
was
someone
to
look
for?
because
i
don't
imagine
you
arrest
everybody
on
i-80
that
goes
70
miles
an
hour.
i've
done
it
many
times
myself.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
what
time
of
day
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
dogs
get
a
little
more
sophisticated
in
the
future
and
can
also
smell
a
certain
kind
of
perfume,
something
like
that?
would
then
the
whole
analysis
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
would
you
know
whether
the...
the
dog...
i
don't
think
the
dog
alerts,
as
i'm
alerting,
for
one
reason
or
another.
he
just
alerts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
learned
this
morning
that
some
very
well
trained
dogs
that
are
trained
to
alert
for
explosives
will
also
alert
for
certain
kinds
of
rubber
in
a
tire.
they
didn't
realize
that.
and
i
think
it's
entirely
possible
that
dogs
would...
there
will
be
false
alerts
by...
by
dogs
because
it's
triggered
by
something
that...
that
is
not
really
anticipated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
agree
the
analysis
would
be
different
if
there
could
be
an
innocent
cause
of
the
alert
as
well
as
the
contraband
being
the
cause
of
the
alert.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
would
argue
that
the
same
rationale
should
apply
if,
instead
of
using
dogs,
you
had
some
sophisticated
device
that
would
buzz
or
ring
a
bell
or
something
whenever
the
odor
of...
of
narcotics
was
present,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
nothing
magical
about
the
fact
that
it's
an
animal
rather
than
a
sophisticated
device.
it
has
better
detection
capacity
than
a
human
being
does.
that's
the
only
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
you
may
save
your
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wray.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
going
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
dogs
were
trained
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
back
in
the
18th
century?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
potentially
revealed.
it
did
not
actually
reveal
any
details.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
in
1790.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
really
think
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
officer
had
a
device
that
did
exactly
what
the
dog...
dog
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
you'd
take--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you,
mr.
wray.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
meczyk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
respond
to
one
point
in
place,
if
i
remember
correctly.
it
must
be
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
and
if
the
only
thing
the
dog
can
detect
is
something
illegitimate,
how
can
you
say
there's
an
invasion
of
a
legitimate
expectation
in
privacy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
meczyk.
general
madigan,
you
have
i
think
about
3
minutes
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
general
madigan.
the...
the
case
is
submitted.
