mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
does
not
offer
any
fourth
amendment
justification
whatsoever
in
regards
to...
in
this
case.
it
argues
instead
that
there...
there
was
no
need
for
any
justification,
and
that
is
incorrect
for
two
reasons.
the
dog
sniff
in
this
case
invaded
a
fourth
amendment
interest
of
mr.
caballes
in
the
context
of
a
routine
traffic
search.
the
sniff
in
this
case
was,
in
fact,
a
search.
albeit
it
was
a
limited
intrusion,
it
was
still
a
search
nonetheless.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
any
observation
i
think--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--there
is
in
this
case...
see
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
well--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--well,
to...
see
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
if
you're
looking
with
someone
with
that
nervous
tic,
that
would
be
something
in
open
view
or
plain
view.
that's
not
the
type
of
investigation
i'm
talking
about.
there
is
in
fact,
most
respectfully,
an
investigation
technique
here.
there's
an
investigation
measure.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
the
only
way
i
can
analogize
that,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
it...
that
is
akin
to
a
plain
smell
or
plain
view.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
i
don't--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--but
this
is
with
a
specific
investigative
tool.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
well,
this
is--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--this
is
a
far
more...
most
respectfully,
this
is
a
far
more
sophisticated
investigative
tool.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
then
maybe
i
can
see
if
i
could
answer
your
question.
mr.
caballes
in
this
case
indeed
had
an
expectation
of
privacy.
when
he
was
asked
by
the
police
officer
in
this
case
if
he
can
consent
to
the
search,
he
said
no.
he
did
not
want
that
law
enforcement
officer
looking
in--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--well,
i--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--justice
o'connor,
i
do
not...
i
do
not
want
you
to
reverse
place.
place,
no
pun
intended--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--well,
there
were--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--the
way
i
understand
place
it
was
contextually
limited.
in
place,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
seizure,
the
taking
of
the
luggage,
was
to
submit
it
to
a
drug-detection
sniff.
that
is
the
opinion
authored
by
your
honor,
that
specifically
stated...
i'm
not
going
to
say
took
for
granted,
but
it
specifically
stated
that
the...
the
context...
and
that's
what
we
have
to
look
at
place...
the--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--well,
i...
i--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--well,
i
think
that
first
in...
in
that
case,
in
place,
the...
the
court--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--but
it
was...
unlike
place,
the
legitimate
traffic
stop
here
was
completely
unrelated
to
the
purpose
of
the
dog
sniff.
there
was
an
absolute--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--well,
again,
i
would
again
respectfully
assert
that
the
dog
sniff
is
a
search
and
the
way
place
was
decided,
first,
the
decision
had
to
be
made,
in
the
context
of...
of
that
case,
what
was
worse.
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
the
luggage?
were
they
going
to
open
the
luggage
first?
so,
of
course,
the
court
had
to
decide
in
that
case
that
it
wasn't
that
kind
of
a...
a
search.
it
wasn't
as
egregious
a
search
as
actually
opening
the
luggage.
then
you--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
again,
in
this
context,
unlike
in
place,
there
was
absolutely
no
relationship
between
the...
the
dog
sniff
and
the
dog
sniff
of
caballes'
trunk
and
the
sniff
of
the
luggage
that
was
placed
at
laguardia
airport
in
place.
there's
a
great
distinction.
moreover--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--it's
not
a
search.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
it
is
not
a
search.
if
he
follows
you--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--well--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i
think
here
the
most
distinctive
point
here
is
that
caballes
had
already
been
stopped
unlike
the
hypothetical
that
you
just
presented
to
me.
caballes
was
already
stopped
for
one...
for
probable
cause.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
then
now
the
police
launch
into
a
wholly
unrelated
investigation
that's--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i
think--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--even
in
that
case,
even
in
a
hypothetical
where
they
used
the
dog
for
a
toll
booth,
i
have
a
problem
with
that.
that
to
me
is
a
search.
it's
different
than...
i
would
assert
it's
different
than
if
they
walked...
one
of
the
hypotheticals
that
the
justices
asked
my
adversary
in
this
case,
when
they
asked,
well,
what
if
they
walked
the
dog
instead
around
a...
parked
cars
or
parked
cars
at
a
stadium?
it
depends
for
what
purpose
they
want
to
walk
those
parked...
that
dog
around
those
parked
cars.
my
assertion
is--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
well,
i...
i
strongly
differ.
i
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
that
they
are
going
to
use
the
dog
for.
this
court--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--justice
o'connor,
it
depends
on
the
purpose.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
the
answer
is
yes.
i
have
no
problem
whatsoever.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
wherever
it
is
because
i
look
at
it
as
a
public
safety
exception.
and
this
court
in
the
edmond
case
specifically
condemned
a
general
search...
a
general
crime...
let
me
use
the
exact
words.
general
interest
in
crime
control,
to
quote
the
edmond
case.
and
that's--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i'm
struggling,
yes.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
it
invades
a
public...
i'm
sorry.
it
invades
a
private
space
that
in
this
particular
case
the
respondent
caballes
had
a
privacy
interest
in,
that
he
wanted
to
exclude
the
whole
world
from
going
inside
his
trunk.
that's
the
difference.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
well,
it
is...
it's
true
that
one
does
not
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
contraband,
but
by
the
same
token,
i
have
an
expectation
or
mr.
caballes
had
an
expectation
of...
of
privacy
of
what's
inside
that
closed
trunk,
his
car.
the
carroll
doctrine
is
still
good
law.
we
still
apply
the
fourth
amendment
in
cars.
it's
true
that
the
home
is
sacrosanct,
but
just
because
it's
a
home,
it's
not
a
talisman
where...
where
the
fourth
amendment
no
longer
applies.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
of
course.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
my
recollection
is
that
trooper
gillette,
who
was
the
officer
who
stopped
caballes,
did
not
have
a...
a
dog
in
the
car.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
i
see.
if
he
had
a
dog
in
the
car
and
the
dog
just
happened
to
have
alerted
without
his
cuing
the
dog
or
walking
the
dog...
and
i'll
answer
that
in
a
moment
too...
that
would
be
pure
serendipity.
that
might
happen.
if...
if
the
dog
just
happened
to
have
alerted.
but
if
the
troopers
deliberately
drove
the
car
close
by...
and
in
reality,
that's
not
what
happens.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
okay.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
my
understanding
of
the
way
this
works,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
he
just
couldn't
go
up
to
the
car
without...
and
the
dog
would
alert.
my
understanding
of
the
way
these
dogs
are
trained
is
that
they
specifically...
that
the
officer
has
to
walk
the
dog
around
the
car,
the
vehicle,
first
of
all.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
he
does
that.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
he
does
that.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
to
cue
the
dog.
in
other
words,
tell
him
it's
not
playtime
anymore,
that
he
has
to
work.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
to
trigger
something
in
the...
in
the
canine
brain.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
it
wouldn't
be
bad
that's
what...
well,
yes.
in
this
case
it's
very
bad
because
it's
a
search.
there's
no
question.
i'm
not
coming
off
of
that.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
i...
i
think
what
i
meant
there...
there
would
have
been...
it
would
have
been
purely
happenstance,
almost
like
plain
view.
it
would
have
been...
without
him
even
cuing
the
dog
or
starting
to
walk
the
dog
around,
my
answer
to
that
justice
ginsburg
is
that
that
would
have
been
all
right.
except
now
that...
the
more
i
think
about
it,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
would
be
all
right.
and
my
answer
to...
and
the
reason
for
that
is
i
think
in
that
case
the
officer,
if
he
could
do
such
a
thing
and
the
dog
would
alert,
would
be
exploiting
the
situation,
would
just
be
taking
the
dog
and
walking
him
around
the
car
and
seeing
that
the
dog
alerted.
so
in
other
words,
there...
there
would
be,
i
think,
an
exploitation
of...
of
the...
of
the
traffic
stop.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
yes.
i...
if
we
had
an
atwater
situation...
in
this
case
there
wasn't
an
atwater
situation
because
there
was
first
a
warning
given.
you're
correct.
there
was
a
warning
given.
i'm
sorry.
the
officer
gillette
told
caballes
he
was
going
to
give
him
a
warning.
so
unlike
the
knowles--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--he
could
have,
but
he
didn't.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
he
didn't.
instead,
he
chose
to
treat
this
as
more
of
a
knowles
situation.
this
case
is...
is
on
all
fours,
no
pun
intended,
like
knowles.
in
other
words,
in
the...
in
knowles
v.
iowa,
the
court...
a
case
of
this...
i'm
sorry.
let
me
untwist
my
tongue.
in
knowles
v.
iowa,
you
had
a...
you
had
a
traffic
stop
and
after
the
traffic
stop,
there
was
a
statute
that
said
unrelated
to
the
traffic
stop,
you
can
go
in
and
search.
and
this
is
the
same
thing.
this
officer
here
gillette
treated
caballes
as
the
officer
in
knowles
in...
treated
mr.
knowles
in
iowa.
it's
the
exact
same
thing.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
to
me,
once
a
person
is
told
that
he
is
not
going
to
be
under
arrest,
it
changes
the
whole
complexion
of
the
case.
i
think
it's
a
completely
different...
a
completely
different
scenario.
we
don't
have
an
arrest.
it
doesn't
matter.
atwater--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--it's
a
difficult
question,
but
i
have
to
look
at
what...
i
think
reasonableness
is
judged.
again,
i'm
going
to
remember
what
the...
those
cases
taught.
i
think
what
knowles
taught,
that
reasonableness
is
judged
by
what
the
police
actually
do
as
opposed
to
what
they
might
have
done.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
it
depends--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--it's
a
little
less
problematic
to
me,
justice
scalia,
than
the
type
of
stop
i'm
talking
about
here.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
it's
a
little
less
problematic.
one,
because
it's
a
public
place
and
i...
i
think--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i
know,
but...
but
here
i
think
there's
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy.
well,
i
don't
even
want
to
go
that
far.
i...
i
have
to
answer
your
question.
i
think
that
submitting
the
dogs
without
any...
submitting
the
luggage
without
any
reasonable
articulable
suspicion--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--unlike
the
case--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--unlike
the
case
in...
in
place,
that
that
to
me
is
still
a
search.
so--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--and
i
am
saying
it.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
sorry
it
took
me
so
long.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
it
goes
back
to--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--there's
nothing
wrong
if
he
can
detect
limburger
cheese.
that
to
me
is
like
plain
smell.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
as
awful
as
that--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--as
awful
as
it
might
be--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i
guess
you--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i
guess
you're
telling
me
i'm...
i'm
the
underdog
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
it
is--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--no.
it--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--yes,
correct,
justice--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
what
makes
this
particular
so--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--i
would
agree
with
that
if
i
use
an...
if...
if
you're
referring
to
an
atwater
type
scenario.
if
they
have
probable...
if
they
decide
to
arrest,
even
though
it's
on
a
minor
traffic
case,
such
as
atwater,
which
was
a
seat
belt,
as
long
as
it's...
if...
if
it's
minor
and
if
the
officer
elects
to
choose
to
do
a
full-blown
arrest,
then
all
the
consequences
that
follow
from
that
arrest
are...
it's
going
to
happen.
excuse
me.
it's
going
to
happen.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
i...
i
think
that
when
the
officer
does
a
full-blown
arrest,
as
was
envisioned
in
atwater,
you
know
that
you...
the
person
knows
that
he
or
she
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
essentially
yes,
because
i
think
that
the
officer
takes
a
physical
action.
it's
just
more
than
words.
it's
also
his
deeds.
i
think
in
atwater,
unlike
knowles...
in
atwater,
in
that
case,
i
think
the...
the
officer
did
make
an
election,
and
there
was
a
full-blown
or
a
full-fledged
arrest.
and
i
think
there
your...
your
reasonable
expectation
to
privacy
does,
in
fact,
go
out
the
window.
but
this
is
so
different.
this
was
just
a
warning.
period.
it
was
nothing
worse
than
a
warning.
what
makes
this
stop
so
pernicious
is
that
it
takes
place
in
front
of
the
whole
world
and
is
accusatory.
it
is
profoundly
embarrassing,
and
it
is
humiliating
to
everyone
on
the
street.
so
if
a
person
is
stopped
and
the
officer
just
decides
to
stop
you
for
a
minor
traffic
offense,
that's
the
worst
part
about
this
case.
just
a
minor
traffic
offense,
really
a
frivolous
offense,
basically
what
any
law-abiding
citizen
would
happen
to...
it
could
happen
to
anyone.
and
as
this
court
has
said,
even
in
whren,
there
are
so
many
multiple
technical
violations
of...
of...
technical
violations--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--no,
justice
scalia--
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
--that...
in
that
situation,
when
you
enter
the
country...
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
again...
it's
a
border
search.
there's
nothing
that
i
can
argue
against
the
border
search.
it's
the...
or
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
that
is
a
border
search.
i
bring
luggage
to
the
airport,
in
today's
world
i
have
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy.
if
i
know
i'm
traveling
abroad
and
coming
into
the
united
states,
that's
different.
that's
different
in
an
airport.
mr.
ralph
e.
meczyk
a
bus
station
here
inside
the
united
states
is
different
i
think.
i...
i
look
at
your
airport
hypothetical
as
being...
as
dealing
with
a
border.
if
it's
not
at
a
border
and
i
use
your
hypothetical,
it's
at
o'hare
airport
or
reagan
international
airport
and
they
bring
a
dog
up
to
sniff
for
drugs
at
the
carousel,
that
to
me
is
a
search.
it's
like...
i
think
you
said
in
one
opinion
once
if
it...
you
used
the
duck
analogy,
well,
if
it
walks
like
a
duck
or
quacks
like
a
duck.
here
it's
still
a
search.
it
walks
like
a...
a
dog
and
it
acts
like
a
dog,
but
its
specific
function
is
in
fact
to
search
out
in
public
and
humiliate
people.
if
there
are
any
further
questions.
i
respectfully
ask
this
honorable
court
to
affirm
the
wise
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
thank
you.
