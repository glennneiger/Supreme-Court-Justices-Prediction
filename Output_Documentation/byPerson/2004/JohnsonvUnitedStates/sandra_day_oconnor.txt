justice
sandra
day
o'connor
one
little
complication
here.
under
2255,
even
if
that
applies
in
this
situation,
it
does
establish
a
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
subsection
(4)
of
that
section
says:
the
date
on
which
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
or
claims
presented
could
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
now,
is
that
a
requirement
that
the
defendant
seek
state
relief
on
a
timely
basis?
can
the
defendant
just
wait
indefinitely
before
going
back
to
the
state
and
seeking
a
vacatur?
or
does
that
due
diligence
requirement
apply
to
the
efforts
to
get
state
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you're
not
being
responsive
to
my
question.
here
the
defendant
did
go
back
to
the
state
courts
and
got
this...
the
earlier
convictions
vacated.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
asked
you,
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
defendant
act
promptly
in
going
back
to
the
state
to
get
the
vacaturs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
that
the
statute
itself
speaks
of
diligence.
now,
can
the...
suppose
he's
been
given
a
very
long
federal
sentence
and
part
of
that
is
the
result
of
prior
state
convictions.
and
suppose
he
waits
10
years
before
going
back
to
the
state
to
seek
to
overturn
those
earlier
state
convictions.
is
there
no
requirement
that
he
act
promptly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
federal
statute
says...
it
puts
a
burden
of
diligence
on
the
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
wasn't...
didn't
mr.
johnson
here
wait
a
couple
of
years
after
the
federal
sentencing
before
he
tried
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
not
sure
that
was
a
diligent
sort
of
a...
an
effort.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
this
case
now,
the
petitioner
did
obtain
a
vacatur
of
the
two
state
convictions.
isn't
that
so?
don't
we
accept
that
as
a
fact
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
he
did
succeed.
and
then
we
have
to
look
at
whether
the
petitioner
has
complied
with
section
2255
of
aedpa.
and
so
we
look
to
subpart
(4),
do
we
not,
in
this
case
to
answer
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
possible,
but
you
also
question
whether
the
vacatur
can
be
a
fact
under
subsection
(4).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
you
think
that
the...
the
vacatur
here
could
be
a
fact,
but
then
you
say
that
even
so,
the
petitioner
didn't
go
back
to
state
court
diligently
and
on
a
timely
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
say
he
was
not
diligent
in
challenging
those
convictions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
announcing
this
on
behalf
of
justice
souter,
the
author
of
the
majority
but
without
his
distinctive
new
england
accent.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
petitions
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
federal
court
are
governed
by
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1966
known
as
aedpa,
which
imposes
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations
on
petitions
filed
by
prisoners
who
seek
to
modify
or
vacate
their
federal
sentences.
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
one-year
time
clock
runs
from
the
date
on
which
the
facts
supporting
the
federal
prisoners
claim
could
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
the
petitioner,
robert
johnson,
jr.
received
an
enhanced
federal
sentence
because
he
had
two
prior
convictions
in
the
state
of
georgia.
johnson
later
petitioned
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
georgia
state
court
claiming
that
the
guilty
pleas
he
entered
in
seven
cases
including
one
the
federal
court
had
used
to
enhanced
his
federal
sentence
were
invalid
because
he
had
not
knowingly
intelligently
and
voluntarily
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
the
state
court
agreed
with
johnson
and
entered
an
order
vacating
all
seven
of
johnson’s
state
court
convictions.
a
little
over
three
months
later,
johnson
returned
to
the
federal
district
court
with
a
motion
to
vacate
his
enhanced
federal
sentence
on
the
ground
that
one
of
the
predicate
convictions
supporting
the
enhancement
had
now
been
vacated.
johnson
claimed
this
motion
was
filed
in
time
because
the
state
court’s
vacator
was
a
new
fact
triggering
the
one-year
limitation
period.
the
district
court
disagreed
and
denied
it
as
did
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
an
opinion
file
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
affirm
the
judgment
though
not
the
reasoning
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
subject
to
exceptions
not
relevant
here,
this
court
has
held
in
two
previous
cases
that
a
prisoner
facing
a
federal
sentencing
enhancement
may
not
litigate
in
federal
court
the
validity
of
a
prior
state
conviction
unless
he
first
goes
back
to
the
state
courts
to
obtain
an
order
vacating
that
prior
conviction.
because
the
state
court
vacator
is
a
necessary
pre-condition
to
obtaining
relief
in
federal
court,
we
agree
with
johnson
that
the
vacator
is
a
matter
of
fact
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
of
limitation
rule
and
that
the
one
year
period
therefore
may
run
form
the
date
the
prisoner
receives
notice
of
that
state
court
order.
the
vacator
of
a
conviction
may
be
spoken
of
as
a
matter
of
fact
just
as
sensibly
as
the
conviction
itself
and
is
subject
to
proof
or
disproof
just
like
any
other
factual
issue.
nevertheless,
we
do
not
accept
johnson's
view
in
its
entirety
because
he
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
aedpa
statute
of
limitations
requires
a
petitioner
to
exercise
due
diligence
in
discovering
the
facts
supporting
his
challenge
to
the
federal
sentence.
we
hold
that
notice
of
the
state
court
order
vacating
a
prior
conviction
will
only
trigger
a
full
one-year
limitation
period
if
the
petitioner
acted
with
due
diligence
in
seeking
that
vacator
after
the
federal
court
enters
judgment
in
the
case
with
the
sentence
enhancement.
a
different
rule
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
text
and
with
aedpa’s
basic
purpose
of
promoting
the
finality
of
federal
judgments.
in
this
case,
johnson
was
obliged
after
the
district
court
entered
its
judgment
in
the
federal
criminal
case
to
act
diligently
to
obtain
the
state
court
order
vacating
his
prior
conviction.
had
he
done
so,
the
one
year
limitation
period
would
have
run
from
the
date
he
received
that
notice
of
that
vacator.
however,
johnson
failed
to
attack
that
prior
conviction
for
more
than
three
years
after
the
entry
of
the
judgment
in
his
federal
case.
johnson
offers
no
acceptable
excuse
for
this
unreasonable
delay.
johnson’s
motion
to
vacate
the
federal
sentence
was
therefore
properly
dismissed
as
untimely.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
stevens,
scalia,
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
