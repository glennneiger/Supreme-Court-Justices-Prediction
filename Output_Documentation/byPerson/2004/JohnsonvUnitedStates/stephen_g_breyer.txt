justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
it
could
have
been
discovered
i
guess
if
he
had
taken
due
diligence
and
gone
and
made
the
motion
within
a
year,
at
least,
of
his
having
been
convicted
in
the
federal
court.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
you
want
us
to
read
that
phrase
very
broadly
to
include
under
the
word
facts
something
like
a
vacatur,
and
then
it
sounds
to
me
you're
being
very
literal
and
linguistic
when
you
say
that
due
diligence
to
find
the
facts
shouldn't
mean
what
i
would
take
it
as
ordinarily
meaning,
that...
that
you
have
to,
when
you
had
a
chance,
go
back
and
generate
this
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
both,
in
other
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
pure
english
language,
it's
not
exactly
a
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it's
a
legal
determination.
we
usually
separate
law
from
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
right?
because
i
thought
that
justice
souter
provided
that,
but
you
don't
because
if
you're
relegated
to
(4)...
let's
say
it
becomes
final
quickly.
if
you're
relegated
to
(4),
what
you're
saying
is
the
date
on
which
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
could
have
been
discovered,
if
this
is
a
conviction
that
took
place
10
years
earlier,
you
are
saying
the
date
on
which
those
facts
could
have
been
discovered
was
9
years
earlier
or
whenever
he
could
have
brought
it...
brought
the
claim
in
the...
in
the
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
therefore,
it
is
not
true
that
he
always
has
that
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
the
date
of
judgment
became
final
prior
to
the
running
of
(4),
then
he
would
not
have
a
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
my
question
actually
is
the...
aside
from
justice
souter's
practical
point,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
language
here
is
different
from
daniels
and
different
in
the
other
cases.
the
language
is
the
date
on
which
facts
supporting
the
claim
or
claims
presented
could
have
been
discovered.
and
facts
supporting
the
claim
prior
to
there
being
a
claim
are
not
facts
supporting
the
claim.
and
therefore,
it
seems
as
if
it
would
run
no
later
than
the
moment
when
he
presents
the
federal
claim.
no
earlier
than
that
could
it
run.
so
you
have
a
year
from
the
time
that
you
present
the
federal
claim.
at
that
point,
all
those
facts
that
could
have
been
discovered
earlier,
now
he
has
a
year
to
call
them
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
and
of
course,
for
reasons
that
you
point
out,
this
is
certainly
a
fact
that
could
have
been
discovered
earlier.
he
could
have
brought
his
motion
long
before.
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
it
combines
the
practical
reason
that
justice
souter
mentioned
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
certainly
not
taking...
advocating
the...
the
defendant's
position.
i'm
advocating
the
position
as
follows.
suppose
it
were
not
a
vacatur.
suppose
it
were
a
dna
test,
and
suppose
it
were
a
fact
that
the
dna
test
identified
a
different
perpetrator
of
a
long-gone
state
crime
and
it
was
definite.
now,
if
no
one
thought
of
running
that
dna
test,
although
they
should
have,
until
4
years
after
the
federal
conviction,
he's
out
of
luck.
he
has
1
year
from
the
federal
conviction,
and
that
1
year
he
has
to,
during
that
year,
do
everything,
including
bringing
facts
into
being,
such
as
the
result
of
the
dna
test,
that
he
had
not
previously
done.
and
that's
consistent
with
the
language.
it
avoids
justice
souter's
practical
problem,
and
it
does
not
impose
an
unreasonable
burden
on
the
government,
i
wouldn't
think,
because
he
has
just
a
year
from
conviction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
certainly...
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
opposite
argument
if
it
were
a
dna
test?
if
it
were
a
dna
test,
you
would
certainly
be
arguing
that
even
though
the
results
didn't
come
into
existence
until
32
years
after
his
federal
conviction,
that
he
could
have
discovered
it
38
years
before
because
he
could
have
asked
that
the
test
then
be
performed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then...
then
once
you
admit
that,
you're
going
to
have
to
find
a
difference
between
this
and
the
dna
test,
or
your
position
here,
if
adopted,
will
catch
you
out
there.
