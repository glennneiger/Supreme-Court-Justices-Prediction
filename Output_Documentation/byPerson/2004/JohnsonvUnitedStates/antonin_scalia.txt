how...
how
could
one
not
discover
the
vacatur?
here's
my
problem.
i...
i
frankly
don't
think
the
text
of...
of
(4),
part
(4),
really
fits
comfortably
with
either
your
interpretation
or
the
government's.
it
says
the
date
on
which
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
could
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
diligence.
well,
as
you
point
out
in
your
brief,
the
fact
supporting
the
claim
here
is
simply
the
elimination
of
the
prior
conviction,
the
vacatur
of
the
prior
conviction.
that's
the
fact
supporting
the
claim,
not
the
facts
which
led
to
the
vacatur,
but
it's
the
vacatur.
so
that
makes
the
government's
case
a
little
uncomfortable.
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
your
case
is
pretty
uncomfortable
when
you...
when
you
talk
about
discovering
the
fact
of
the...
of
the
vacatur.
i
mean,
it's
a
matter
of
public
record.
how
does
one
discover
a...
a
public
record?
how...
how
could
you
need
due
diligence
to
discover
a
public
record?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's...
it's
automatically...
isn't
the
vacatur
always
served
on
the...
on
the
person
whose
conviction
is
vacated?
isn't
it
always
that
person
who
seeks
the
vacation?
so
what
sense
does
it
make
to
talk
about
his
discovering
that
particular
fact?
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
no
sense.
so
you're
left
with...
with
two
competing
interpretations,
both
of
which
have
some
textual
problems.
i'm
inclined
to
think
you
take
the
one
that
makes
sense,
given
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
justice
o'connor
has
suggested,
is
to
make
people
bring
up
their
claims
promptly.
and...
and
that
purpose
would...
would
be
served
by
the
government's
rule
and
not
by
yours.
you
say
unless
the
state
has
some
statute
of
limitation,
this...
this
federal
requirement
of
due
diligence
goes
begging.
what's...
what's
your
response
to
that?
you
really
think...
especially
about
the
discover.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
say
that.
what...
what...
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's...
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be
but
that
also
may
be
what
it
says.
i...
i
don't
follow
your
interpretation
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
facts
supporting
the
claim
or
claims.
i
mean,
once
you
say
that
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
is
the
vacatur
of
the...
of
the
state
conviction,
i
mean,
it
seems
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
as
for
due
diligence,
yes,
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
much
sense
in
that
context,
but
as
pointed
out
by
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
it
makes
sense
in
all
other
contexts
and...
and
you
don't
expect
the
language
to
be
applicable
all
the
time.
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
well
be,
but
that's
how
they
wrote
it.
i'm
talking
about
the
word
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
this
be
a
fact
supporting
the...
you...
you
want
us
to
say
a
fact
supporting
the
conviction
includes
the
facts
that
lead
up
to
the
facts
supporting
the
conviction
or...
or
supporting
the
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
still
asking
us...
i
mean,
even...
even
in
your
fall-back
position...
your...
your
principal
position
asks
us
to...
to
play
games
with
the...
with
the
word
facts,
and
your
fall-back
position
asks
us
to
play
games
with
the
word
discovered.
you
want
us
to
read
discovered
to
mean
either
discovered
or
obtained,
which
discovered
just
doesn't
mean
obtained.
it
just
doesn't.
