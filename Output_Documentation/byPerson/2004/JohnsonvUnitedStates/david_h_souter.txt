justice
david
h.
souter
well,
just
so
that
i
understand
your
argument
then,
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
if
you
get
a
long
sentence,
can
you
sit
there
for
10
years,
then
initiate
the
process
to
get
the
earlier
conviction
vacated
and
then
say,
as
soon
as
it
is,
with
due
diligence
i'm
here
at
the
courthouse
because,
although
i
waited
10
years,
i
have
brought
my
2255
as
soon
as
i
learned
that
my
earlier
sentence
had
been
vacated?
your
answer
to
that
question,
i
take
it,
is
yes,
he
satisfies
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
in...
in
six
states,
i
would
have
thought
that,
a,
the
due
diligence
language,
together
with
the
general
obvious
policy
of
aedpa,
to
get
this
over
with,
would
have
made
it
very
difficult
to
conclude
that
he
can
sit
there
without
doing
anything
for
10
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
it's
only
in
six
states,
but
six
states
count.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
here's...
here's
a
simple
way
of
looking
at
it.
the
minute
that
you're
convicted
and
you
are
subject
to
the
enhanced
sentence
based
on
a
prior
conviction,
the
obligation
of
due
diligence
begins.
you
can't
sit
there
for
10
years.
that's
the
point
at
which
you've
got
to
file
your
petition
so
that
you
can
come
into
court
with
reasonable
promptness,
if
not
by
the
sentencing
hearing
itself,
as
soon
afterwards
as
the
state
process
allows
you.
that
would
be
a
simple
due
diligence
point.
it
wouldn't
involve
placeholder
petitions,
and
it
would
get
things
concluded
with
reasonable
promptness.
why
isn't
that
a
way
of...
of
applying
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
easy.
the
minute
he's
convicted,
the
state
has
charged
him
and...
and...
or
his...
by
some
charging
document
has
made
clear
that
there
is
going
to
be
an
invocation
of
a
prior
conviction
for
an
enhanced
sentence.
as
soon
as
he
is
convicted
of
the
later
offense
in
which
that
sentencing
possibility
has
been
raised,
he
has
an
obligation
to
go
into
the
state
court
and
start
the
process
of...
of
getting
his
earlier
conviction
vacated.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
would
have
acted
with
due
diligence
and
he
would
have
had
as...
i
suppose,
a
very
powerful
argument,
which...
which
the
government
apparently
would
accept,
for...
for
tolling.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
himmelfarb--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would...
would
you
comment
on...
on
one
difficulty
i
have
with
what,
i
take
it,
is
your
preferred
position
of
measuring
due
diligence
from...
as
i
understand
it,
from
the...
the
date
at
which
the
state
conviction
became
final?
most
of
these...
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
most
of
the
state
convictions,
like
most
convictions
in...
in
general,
are
going
to
rest
on...
on
guilty
pleas.
it
just
is
not
realistic
to
assume
that
congress
assumed
a
due
diligence
system
which
was
going
to
require
a
state
defendant
immediately
to
start
a
collateral
attack
on
a
guilty
plea.
i
mean,
if...
if
there...
if
there
were
reasons
for
the
collateral
attack
that
seemed
strong
and
worthwhile,
he
wouldn't
have
been
entering
the
guilty
plea.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we're
going
to
measure
due
diligence
from
the
date
of
conviction,
most
convictions
resting
on
pleas,
as
a
practical
matter
under
your
system,
a
conviction
that
rests
on
a
plea
is
never
going
to
be
subject
to
a
timely
challenge
for
purposes
of
applying
2255.
is...
is
that
a
fair
comment,
or
have
i...
have
i
missed
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you
comment
specifically
on
your
preferred
position
which
starts
at
the
very...
as
i
understand
it,
starts
at
the
earliest
date,
which
would
be
the
date
of
the
state
conviction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
it...
i
guess
my
problem
is
isn't...
isn't
it
a
sense...
isn't
your
argument
for
a
sense
of
diligence
which
is
really
other-wordly?
at
the
moment
the
defendant's
conviction
based
upon
his
plea
becomes
final,
it
simply
is
unrealistic
to
expect
that
any
defendant
would
have
an
incentive
to
attack
that
conviction.
and...
and
the
result,
it
seems
to
me,
of...
of
your
position,
your
preferred
position,
is
if...
if
diligence
is
measured
from
that
moment,
that
no
defendant
will
ever
be
diligent
because
no
defendant
will
ever
have
an
incentive
at
that
point
to
be
diligent.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
the
one
you're
offering?
before
you
tell
me
why
mine
is
bad,
tell
me
why
yours
does
not
suffer
the...
the...
at
least
i
think,
the
objection
that
i've...
i've
raised?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
that's
right.
but
why
is
the
requirement
on
your
reading
to
challenge
it
promptly
after
it
is
entered
in
these
plea
situations,
not
a
just
totally
unrealistic
requirement
that
will
never
be
met
and
will
result
in
a
consequence
that
all
state
convictions,
resting
upon
pleas,
will
be,
in
effect,
insulated
from
later
collateral
attack
when...
under...
for
purpose
of
2255?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
say
we're
all
stuck
with
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
mind,
but...
if...
if
you
think...
if
you
think
there's
anything
to
my
objection,
you're
in
effect
saying,
too
late.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
also
true
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you're
saying
due
diligence
applies
to
an
extraneous
fact
when
you
could,
in
the
simple
sense,
discover
it.
it
applies
to
a
generated
fact
when
you
could
have
generated
it.
