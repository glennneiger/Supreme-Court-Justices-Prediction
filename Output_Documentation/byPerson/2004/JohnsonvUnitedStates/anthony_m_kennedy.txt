justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
make
the
argument
or
is
it
implicit
in
your
argument...
maybe
you
don't
have
this
concern...
that
if
you
imply
a
federal
due
diligence
standard
on
your
duty
to
vacate
the
state
conviction,
that
it's
just
too
burdensome
on
the
petitioner
who
has
to
begin
fighting
the
vacatur
battle
at
the
same
time
that
he
has
only
1
year
to
complete
his
habeas
with
reference
to
the
other
challenges
to
his
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
those...
in
those
six
states
or
those
few
states--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--have
those
states
all
made
clear
they'd
say
we
will
never
apply
laches,
or
is
it
just
the
case
that
there
have
never...
there's
never
been
an
instance
where
the
laches
issue
was
presented
to
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
do
you
have
any
explanation
of
why
your
client
waited
so
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
pro
se.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
(4)
is
inapplicable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
to
your
first--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--as
to
your
first...
as
to
your
first
instance,
if
there's
lack
of
diligence,
then
there's
laches.
if
the
records
are
destroyed,
somebody
sits
on
their
rights
and
the
records
are
destroyed,
then
you
have
an
obvious
defense
of
laches.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're...
yes,
i...
i
recognize
that
that's
going
to
be
the
ultimate
issue,
but
your
point
was,
oh,
well,
the
state
is
powerless
because
the
prosecutor
might
not
have
the
records.
the
states
have
laches
provisions
precisely
for
that
circumstance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
your
argument,
but
i
suppose
one
answer
to
justice
souter
is
that
you
get
the
longer
of
(1)
or
(4),
so
that
you
would
always
get
at
least
1
year.
if
the...
if
the
state
conviction
was
10
years
prior
to
the
federal
conviction
and
he
waited
and
did
nothing,
i
take
it,
he
still
has
1
year
because
he
gets
the
longer
of
the
two
provisions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
i
thought
that
you
conceded
at
the
outset
that
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
is
the
vacatur.
i...
i
thought
that
you
opened
up
with
that.
and
it...
it--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
the
minute...
the
minute
that
you...
you
say
that,
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
accept
the
petitioner's
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
which
way
that
cuts.
in
a...
in
a
sense,
if
that
set
of
old
convictions
is
out
of
the
way,
then
you
won't
be
troubled
by
the
loss
of
records
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
recently
i...
i
lost
my
luggage.
i
had
to
go
to
the
lost
and
found
at
the
airline,
and
the
lady
said
has
my
plane
landed
yet.
[laughter]
i
was
kind
of
stopped
by
that
question.
it
seems
to
me
this
case
is
something
like
that.
i
mean,
this
is
just
not
a
question
the...
the
defendant
asks
until
the
federal
conviction
arrives,
which
i...
which
i
suppose
that
argues
for
your
1-year--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--position,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
purpose
of
this
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
he's
been
sentenced.
and
then
he
has
to
go
through
all
the...
the
questioning
as...
as
to
whether
or
not
his
prior
conviction
is...
can
be
set
aside,
and
he
has
to
go
to
state
court
to
do
that.
