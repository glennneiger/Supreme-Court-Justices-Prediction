mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
occasion
a
prior
conviction
that's
used
to
enhance
a
federal
sentence
turns
out
to
have
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
this
court
addressed
the
procedure
for
handling
those
challenges
in
custis
and
daniels.
those
cases
determined
that,
in
most
circumstances,
the
facts
that
would
show
the
prior
conviction
is
unconstitutional
do
not
support
a
claim
either
at
sentencing
or
under
section
2255.
this
is
the
key
phrase
in
this
case:
facts
supporting
the
claim.
it's
the
key
part
of
the
fourth
trigger
in
the
2255
statute
of
limitations.
in
this
case,
the
state
court
vacatur
is
the
fact
supporting
the
claim
for
three
reasons.
first,
as
expressed,
daniels
made
clear
that
the
underlying
facts,
those
facts
that
you
use
for
the
challenge
to
the
prior
conviction,
do
not
support
a
claim
under
2255,
leaving
the
vacatur
as
the
operative
fact.
second,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
fact
encompasses
a
vacatur
just
like
courts
often
refer
to
convictions
as
historical
facts.
and
third,
there's
no
reason
to
dispense
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
to
serve
policy
ends.
the
policies
animating
both
aedpa
and
section
2255
are
served
by
the
rule
advanced
by
petitioner.
and
moreover,
petitioner's
rule
will
be
a
lot
more
straightforward
in
application.
let
me--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--correct.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
well,
there...
there
are
several
levels
to
the
response.
let
me
work
through
them.
the
first
is
that
the
petitioner's
position
relies
on
a
straightforward
reading
of
the
statute,
and
we
think
that
the
due
diligence
requirement
is
satisfied
when
the
vacatur
is
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
yes.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
there's
no
requirement
in...
in
the
fourth
trigger.
however--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--the
requirement
is
not
found
in
the
fourth
trigger.
the
requirement
is
found
in
the
state
statutes
of
limitations.
and
to
elaborate
on
the
footnotes
in
our
brief,
we
have
found
that
there
are
approximately--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--reading
the
plain
language,
we
think
that
burden
of
diligence
applies
to
discovering
the
vacatur.
if
you...
if
a
vacatur
is
a
fact...
and
i
think
the
government
has
all
but--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--i
do
and
here's
why,
first,
starting
with
the
language
before
i
turn
to
the
policy
side
of
your
question.
on
the
language,
paragraph
(4),
the
fourth
trigger,
is
broad
language
that
was
meant
to
cover
a
variety
of
circumstances,
things
from
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
to
brady
violations,
to
vacaturs.
i'll
grant
you
that
if
congress
only
intended
the
vacatur
situation
to
be
covered
by
paragraph
(4),
we
might
wonder
why
they
chose
those
particular
words,
but
we
know
they
didn't
intend
this
one
circumstance.
i
think
the
government's
position
as
to
discover
boils
down
to
this.
because
the
answer
to
the
question,
when
could
the
vacatur
have
been
discovered
through
reasonable
diligence,
is
easy,
the
answer
must
be
wrong.
and
we
don't
believe
that
to
be
the
case.
we
think
that
you
can
easily
ask
when
could
the
vacatur
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
reasonable--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--i--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--i
think
we
can.
i
think
both
the
interpretations
of
each
of
those
contested
words
are
strict
interpretations
right
within
the
plain
meaning.
and
our
case
can
boil
down
to
asking
whether
there's
something
wrong
with
my
english
language
when
i
say,
on
what
day
could
the
vacatur
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
it's--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--well--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--and...
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there's
nothing...
in
this
context
in
particular,
a
vacatur
is
like
a
conviction.
it's
a
fact,
you
know,
that
is...
is
commonly
referred
to
by
the
court.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
he
satisfies
the
statute,
but
i
need
to
point
out
something
that
i
think
is
critical
to
understanding
this
question.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we're
talking
about
at
most
six
states
where
this
might
be
at
issue.
the
rest
of
them
either
have
laches
or
statutes
of
limitations.
and
these
are
small
states.
we're
talking
about
a
rule--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--well,
i--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--they
do
count.
but
it
ties
into
the
response...
the
second
part
of
justice
scalia's
question
is,
isn't
finality
served?
isn't
that
what
aedpa
is
all
about?
we
don't
believe
that
the
government's
rule
that
they
propose
will
serve
finality
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
you're
talking
about
claims
that
will
have
no
merit
in
state
court.
but
because
it's
very
difficult
to
complete
the
state
court
habeas
process
before
the
1
year
in
the
first
paragraph,
these
petitioners
will
file
placeholder
petitions
in
federal
court
and
have
them
held
while
they
finish
their
state
court
review.
so
what
you're
doing
is
you're
talking
about
these
six
states,
maybe
10
guys
a
year,
you're
going
to
cause,
as
the
brackett
court
on
remand
said,
thousands
of
placeholder
petitions
to
be
filed,
and
you're
needlessly
extending
all
of
those
cases
so
that
you
cut
off
the
rights
for
maybe
10
people
who
happen
to
be
in
these
states.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
because
if
you
were
going
to
be
strict
about
it...
and...
and
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
all
of
the
parameters
of
the
hypothetical...
in--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--if
mr.
johnson
had
done
that
in
this
case,
he
still
would
have
missed
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
if
mr.
gadsen
had
done
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
case
by
judge
wilkinson,
he
still
would
have
missed
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
for
equitable
tolling?
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
government
would
accept
equitable
tolling.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
well,
aedpa
was
enacted
after
custis
was
decided
and
i
think
we
presume
that
the
congress
was
aware
of
the
precedent,
but
the--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--yes,
he
did.
the...
the...
our
answer--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--we
believe
it
was
diligent
within
the...
the
fourth
trigger
because,
again,
we
rely
on
the
plain
language.
and
the...
the
fall-back
position,
to
address
your
question
and
justice
souter's
question,
is
that
we
don't
believe...
we
believe
this
is
engrafting
a
whole
different
statutory
scheme
on
top
of
the
one
that
we
have.
the
fall-back
position
of
the
government
is
to
say,
all
right,
let's
interpret
the
statute
or
rewrite
it
to
say
that
we're
going
to
trigger
the
date
on
when
the
vacatur
could
have
been
obtained,
not
when
it
could
have
been
discovered.
and
to
do
that,
what
they're
saying
is,
well,
let's
give
him
a
year
from
the
time
of
the
federal
sentencing.
so...
or...
or
maybe
even
earlier,
dating
back
to
the
time
of
the
original
conviction
in
state
court.
so
they
add
that
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
then
they
say
then
we'll
add
a
provision
that
tolls
during
the
pendency
of
state
habeas,
and
then
we'll
add
another
1-year
statute
of
limitations
on
top
of
that
after
the
vacatur
is
obtained.
so
we
end
up
with...
instead
of
the
plain
language,
we
have
two
1-year
statutes
of
limitations
with
a
tolling
provision
in
between,
the
type
of
tolling
provision
that
is,
by
the
way,
in
section
2244.
we
believe
that
petitioner's
interpretation,
although
the
answer
is
not
difficult,
it...
it
is
the
correct
answer.
on
what
date
did
the...
could
the
vacatur
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence?
and
the
answer
i
think
was--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--well,
we
think
that
that
is...
i'll...
i'll
say
that
there's
no...
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
requirement
in
the
federal
statute,
in
agreement
with...
with
your
statement,
to
exercise
diligence
and
seeking
the
vacatur.
but
we
believe
that
that
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
administrative
decision
that
this
court
made
in
custis
and
daniels
to
send
these
back
to
the
state
court.
it...
it
could
have
been
the
case
that
these
were
all
challenged
at
sentencing,
and
in
fact,
i
think
that
was
the
prevailing
practice
before
custis,
that
they
were
challenged
at
sentencing.
but
custis
and
then
followed
on
by
daniels
made
a
different
decision,
and
i
think
a
good
one.
it
made
the
decision
to
wrap
these
challenges
back
to
the
state
and
that
inevitably
will
result
in
delays
as
it
works
it
way
through
the
state.
the
rationale
for
the
court's
decision
makes
perfect
sense
when
you
apply
it
to
this
context.
one
of
the
key
concerns,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
court
had
was
that
if
you
allow
these
federal
challenges
that
are
outside
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
then
it's
very
possible
the
state
is
not
going
to
have
the
records
necessary
to
defend
it
because
they
wouldn't
be
expected
to
keep
records
outside
of
their
statute
of
limitations.
and
that's
simply
not
the
case
here
because
these
challenges,
under
the
petitioner's
rule,
would
be
within
the
state
statutes
of
limitations,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
daniels,
the
states
have
a
powerful
interest
in
defending
their
convictions
and
that
powerful
interest,
it
seems
to
me,
would
lead
them
to
preserve
the
records
necessary
to
maintain
their
convictions.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
that
is
not
something
that
we've
argued
in
the
briefs.
it...
it,
no
doubt,
is
true
especially
when
you're
talking
about
a
pro
se
petitioner.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
limitations
period
by
statute
or
they
have
a
laches
principle
that
would
limit
the
ability.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
that's
right,
and
from
what
i
can
tell
from
the
department
of
justice
statistics,
there
are
even
fewer
number
of
convictions
in
those
states,
and
best
i
can
back-of-the-envelope
it,
we're
talking
about
maybe
i
think
less
than
10
people
per
year.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
yes.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
the
latter
is
more
accurate.
i'm...
i'm...
i
was
trying
not
to
overreach,
but
i
went
with
the
cases
that
states
that
were
clear
that
laches
would
apply
either
by
statute
or
by
case
law.
and
why
this
becomes
particularly
important
to
me
is
because
we
think
the
petitioner's
rule
serves
the
ends
of
the
federal
court
overall,
especially
when
you're
talking
about
finality
because
it
seems
to
be
the
tail
wagging
the
dog,
in
a
way,
to
have
a
rule
that
cuts
off
the
possibility
of
the
10-year
scenario
for
these
few
cases
and
then
causes
thousands
of
placeholder
petitions
to
be
filed
and
managed.
and
it
has
been
pointed,
you
know,
average
non-merits
dismissal,
we're
talking
about
roughly
260
days.
it's
a
burden
on
the
court
that's
unnecessary,
particularly
to
bring
it
back,
when
we
think
that
in
light
of
custis
and
daniels,
the
plain
language
takes
us
all
the
way
there.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
the
record
doesn't
reveal
except
that
he
is
pro
se.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
yes.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
there's...
i'm
aware
of
the
facts,
but
there's
none
in
the
record
other
than
the
fact
that
he's
pro
se
and
has
limited
education.
i
want
to
point
out
one
thing
that...
that
i
think
is
important
perhaps,
if...
if
the
court
were
to
go
a
way
of
equitable
tolling,
which
as
i've
said,
i
don't
believe
is
appropriate.
but
you
mentioned
that
it
was
3
days
too
late
that
he
filed.
looking
back
at
the
record,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
accurate.
it
shows
that
it
was
received
by
the
court
on
april
25th,
1997,
which
is
1
day
after
the
grace
period
under
aedpa
which...
it
expired
on
april
24th,
1997.
well,
he
did
it
by
mail,
and
under
the
mailbox
rule,
that
would
have
been
a
timely
motion
to
the
extent
that
we
are
concerned
with
equitable
tolling
and...
and
permitting
the
placeholder
petition
of
that
kind.
but
again,
this...
this
difficulty
in
managing
the
process
is
familiar
to
the
court
because
it...
it's
what
happens
when
you
have
these
pro
se
petitioners.
the
important
thing
in
this
case,
we
believe,
the
core
concern
is
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
because
daniels
in
substance
said,
the
underlying
facts
to
a
state
court
vacatur
do
not
support
a
claim,
we
believe
that
you
have
to
read
section
2255,
paragraph
(4)
to
say
that,
okay,
then
the
operative
fact
is
a
vacatur.
and
this
case...
it's
a
very
real
concern
because
without
the
prior
convictions
that
were
later
vacated,
mr.
johnson
would
have
a
roughly
7-year
sentence.
those
prior
convictions
that
were
vacated...
and
we
all
can
conclude
now
were
unconstitutional...
added
8
more
years
on
his
sentence.
he's
serving
more
time
on
the
enhancements
than
he
was
on
the
underlying
sentence.
and
of
course,
the
sentencing
scheme
depends
on
reliability
of
the
information
used
for
purposes
of
sentencing,
and
that's
why
congress
chose
to
enact
the
fourth
paragraph
and
the
statute
of
limitations
so
that
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
correct
unreliable
information
when
it
came
to
light
and
it
was
discovered.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
i
hope
not.
the
government's
position
boils
down
to
this.
they're
advocating
for
the
statute
they
want,
not
the
statute
they
have.
this
statute
says
the
fact
that
could
have
been
discovered
with
exercise
of
due
diligence.
and
once...
as
this
court...
several
justices
have
recognized
once
you
admit
that
the
vacatur
is
a
fact,
the
government's
entire
argument
unravels
because
what
the
government
would
have...
this
court
holds...
is
that
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
is
exactly
what
it
held
it
couldn't
be
in
daniels.
the...
underlying
the
government's
argument
is,
i
think,
a
principle
that...
that
does
not
make
sense.
it's
that
the
state
can't
be
trusted
to
handle
the
challenges
to
prior
convictions.
i
think
that
is
not
only
against
experience.
it
also
cuts
against
this
court's
decisions,
in
particular,
about
daniels.
it
talked
about
the
state
having
a
strong
interest
in
maintaining
its
convictions.
the
idea
about
aedpa
and
finality
i
think
is
also
important.
to
answer
your
question,
justice
stevens,
no,
this
is
not
the
most
important
case
this
court
has
ever
heard.
and
i
think
that
that
ties
into
an
important
point.
to
use
my
rough
numbers,
we're
talking
about
at
this
point
with
the
six
states,
less
than
10
guys
that
might
be
in
this
10-year
scenario
per
year.
i
think
probably
the
number
is
more
like
three
people
per
year.
and
if
the
brackett
court,
the
court
on
the
front
lines
down
there
in
the
district
court,
the
first
circuit
is
right,
we're
talking
about
the
results
of
the
government's
rule
to
be
that
thousands
of
placeholder
petitions
will
be
filed
so
that
petitioners
don't
lose
their
rights
to
challenge
their
federal
sentence
based
on
the
vacatur
of
their
prior
sentences.
and
when...
when
i
think
about
what
serves
the
ends
of
the
statute
and
finality
overall,
i
think
that
to
prolong
all
these
other
cases,
these
thousands
of
cases--
mr.
courtland
l.
reichman
--two
responses
to
that.
first,
if
that
is
the
rule,
i'm
not
sure
i
read
the
eleventh
circuit
to
be
so
crisp
on
it
that
you
definitely
get
tolling.
i
think
it
was
a
case-by-case
determination.
and
anytime
you're
in
a
soft...
what
i
call
soft
equitable
tolling
situation
where
you
don't
know
for
sure,
that's
going
to
lead
to
placeholder
petitions.
alternatively,
if
we're
talking
about
a
rule
that's
a
hard
equitable
tolling
rule,
that
is,
there
is
tolling
every
time
there's
the
pendency
of
the
state
petition,
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
adding
a
provision
very
expressly
to
the
statute
that
doesn't
exist.
2244
has
exactly
that
tolling
provision,
and
that
is
not
in
this...
in
the
2255
provision.
and
this
court
would
be
adding
it,
and
we
don't
think
that
is
appropriate.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there's
been
a
question
about
doesn't
a
tie
go
to
the
government
in
this
case
because
of
finality.
that
is,
if
both
interpretations
are
equally
plausible,
because
of
finality,
doesn't
it
go
to
the
government?
of
course,
you've
heard
me
contest
we
don't
think
it's
a
tie.
we
also
don't
think
finality
cuts
in
the
favor
of
the
government.
but
even
assuming
we
have
a
tie,
we
think
that...
that
should...
the
tie
goes
to
the
petitioner
because
this
statute
is
recognized
in
clay
as
in
derogation
of
common
law,
and
statutes
and
derogation
of
common
law
are
to
be
strictly
construed.
thank
you.
