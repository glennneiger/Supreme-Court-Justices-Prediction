justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
now
hear
argument
in
johnson
against
the
united
states.
mr.
reichman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask?
you
mentioned...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
point...
that
there
are
only
six
states
that
are
really
affected
by
this
rule.
is
that
because
all
the
other
states
have
state
limitations
periods
that
require
the
prisoner
to
act
promptly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the...
the
hypothetical
of
the
prisoner
waiting
10
years
to
challenge
the
state
conviction
can
only
arise
in
a
few
states.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may.
thank
you.
mr.
himmelfarb.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
most
states
have
their
own
limitations
period
that
will
reduce
the
number
of
cases
in
which
there
can
be
inordinate
delay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
says
some
of
them
have
doctrines
of
laches
that
would
kick
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it...
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
state
has
a
greater
interest
than
the
federal
government
does
in
the
finality
of
its
own
convictions,
and
so
the
state
would
be
the
primary
guardian
of
preventing
dilatory
tactics,
it
would
seem
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
general
background
question?
as
i
understand
your
basic
position,
if
the
defendant
lets
things
sit
for
too
long,
he
loses
the
right
to
challenge
the
state
conviction.
on
the...
and...
and
what's...
what's
at
stake
is
an
enhancement
based
on
the...
on
the
prior
conviction.
is
there
ever
a
time
when
the
federal
government
loses
the
right
to
use
a
very
old
conviction
for
enhancement
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
he
gets
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
sort
of
a
broad
question?
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
this
really
isn't
the
most
important
case
we
ever
heard
because
it
only
affects
a
handful
of
enhancements
that
don't
really
affect
the
basic
conviction
or
sentence;
and
secondly,
that
it's
clear
that
the...
from
both
the
text
of
the
statute
and
whatever
we
know
about
the
legislative
history,
that
it's
a
problem
congress
never
even
thought
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
certainly
they
would
have
phrased
the
statute
one
way
or
the
other
more
clearly.
they
could
have
done
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
himmelfarb.
mr.
reichman,
you
have,
i
think,
8
minutes
left.
i'm
not...
i'm
sure
you
don't
really
need
all
8.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
reichman.
the
case
is
submitted.
