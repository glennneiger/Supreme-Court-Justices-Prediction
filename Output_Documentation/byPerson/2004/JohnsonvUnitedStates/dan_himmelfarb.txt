mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
state
court
habeas
corpus
petition,
which
challenged
his
guilty
plea
on
a
ground
available
at
the
time
of
the
plea,
was
filed
nearly
9
years
after
the
plea
was
entered
and
nearly
2
years
after
a
subsequent
federal
conviction
became
final.
petitioner,
nevertheless,
contends
that
the
challenge
to
his
federal
sentence
was
timely
under
aedpa's
1-year
statute
of
limitations
because
it
was
filed
within
a
year
of
the
date
on
which
his
state
conviction
was
vacated.
that
interpretation,
which
enables
a
defendant
to
extend
the
limitation
period
for
challenging
his
federal
conviction
by
delaying
a
challenge
to
his
state
conviction,
is
fundamentally
at
odds
with
the
statutory
text,
the
statutory
purpose,
and
the
overall
statutory
scheme.
to
begin
with
the
statutory
scheme,
under
clause
(1)
of
aedpa's
limitation
provision,
the
presumptive
rule
is
that
a
defendant
wishing
to...
to
collaterally
challenge
a
federal
conviction
has
a
year
from
the
date
on
which
the
conviction
becomes
final.
clauses
(2),
(3)...
(2),
(3),
and
(4)
create
exceptions
to
that
general
rule
when
a
prisoner
is
unable
to
comply
with
the
rule
in
clause
(1)
for
reasons
beyond
his
control.
the
fundamental
flaw
in
petitioner's
interpretation
is
that
it
would
excuse
compliance
with
the
presumptive
rule
in
clause
(1)
for
a
reason
that
is
not
beyond
his
control,
a
failure
to
exercise
diligence
in
challenging
his
state
conviction.
petitioner's
interpretation
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
purpose
of
the
limitation
provision.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no,
justice
kennedy.
we
agree
that
(4)
is
applicable
in
a
case
like
this.
it's
just
that
our
position
is
that
petitioner's
interpretation
of
it
is
wrong.
we
offer
two
alternative
interpretations
of
how
paragraph
6(4)
would
apply
in
a
case
like
this.
before
i
get
to
them,
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
question
that
you
asked
when
petitioner's
counsel
was
standing
up
here,
and
that
had
to
do
with
the
difficulty
of
getting
everything
that
needed
to
be
done
done
in
the
space
of
a
year.
it's
critical
to
keep
in
mind
that
in
the
typical
case
of
this
type,
the
factual
basis
for
the
state
claim
is
going
to
available
at
the
time
of
the
state
guilty
plea
or
trial,
which
in
almost
every
case
is
going
to
be
years
before
the
federal
conviction
becomes
final.
and
since
the
limitation
provision
under
aedpa
runs
from
the
latest
of
the
four
dates,
in
a
typical
case
a
defendant
is
going
to
have
many
years
to
seek
the
vacatur
of
a
state
conviction
and
he'll
have
up
until
a
year
after
his
federal
conviction
becomes
final
to
challenge
it.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
some
states
do
have
statutes
of
limitations.
many
don't.
massachusetts
is
a
prime
example.
it
doesn't.
many
of
the
cases
of
this
type
that
come
through
the
federal
courts
arise
based
on
a...
a
vacated
massachusetts
conviction.
my
understanding
is
that
perhaps
as
many
as
half
the
states
don't
have
limitation
provisions
in
non-capital
cases.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
that's...
that...
that
may
well
be
true,
justice
stevens,
but
laches
is
a
much
more...
a...
a
case-by-case--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--the...
the
state
does
have
an
interest.
the
problem
is
that
when
there's
a
delay
in
filing
a
challenge
to
a
state
conviction,
one
of
two
things
can
be
happen...
can
happen,
and
the
cases
bear
this
out.
one
is
that
you
have
a
state
prosecutor
who
is
perfectly
diligent
and
wants
to
defend
the
conviction
but,
because
of
the
lapse
of
time,
can't
because
the
requisite
records
aren't
available.
the
other
thing
you
see
in
some
of
these
cases
is
that
because
the
state
sentence
has
been
served
by
the
time
it's
challenged
in
cases
of
this
type,
the
state
prosecutor
doesn't
have
the
same
kind
of
incentive--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--the...
the
important
point,
justice
kennedy,
is
the
limitation
provision
at
issue
here
has
to
do
with
the
finality
of
federal
convictions.
congress
was
concerned
that
challenges
to
federal
convictions
would
not
be--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
kennedy,
we're
not
saying
that
states
are
powerless,
and
there
are
many
cases,
probably
the
majority
of
them,
where
states
do
diligently
defend
their
own
convictions
in
cases
of
this
type.
unfortunately,
the
reported
cases
show
that
there
are
many
cases
where
either
they're
not
able
to
or
they're
unwilling
to
because
the
state
sentence
has
long
since
been
served.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
yes,
justice
o'connor.
he
actually
obtained
vacatur
of
seven
prior
state
convictions,
only
one
of
which
was
relevant
to
the
career
offender
sentence
that
he
received
in
the
federal
case.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
in
a
case
of
this
type,
you
would
have
to
look
to
both
subpart
(1)
and
subpart
(4)
and
determine
which
one
gives
him
more
time,
and
whichever
one
gives
him
more
time
is
the
one
that
applies.
we
think
that
6(1)
applies
because
under
6(4)
he
waited
far
too
long
to
challenge
his
state
conviction.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
we
don't
really,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
i
think
the
lower
court
placed
some
weight
on
that
idea.
we
don't
dispute
that
if
a
conviction
is
a
fact,
the
vacatur
can
be
as
well.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
exactly
right.
the
textual
language
we
rely
on
is
not
fact
or
facts
supporting
the
claim,
but
rather
could
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's...
that's
absolutely
our
position,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
no.
we...
we
disagree,
justice
souter.
and
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
say
a
little
bit
about
the...
the
proposal
you
made
when
petitioner's
counsel
was
up
here
about
when
the
diligence
could
be
measured
from.
and
i
think
your
suggestion
was
that
it
could
be
measured
from
the
time
of
the
federal
conviction
or--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--perhaps
the
time
that
federal
charges
are
brought
because
at
that
time,
that's
when
the
defendant
has
the
incentive
to...
to
challenge
the
state
conviction.
we
obviously
prefer
that
interpretation
to
the
one
offered
by
petitioner.
we
think
the
two
that
we
offer
are
better
than
that
one
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
first
is
that
we
think
that
our
two--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that's
right.
we
think
that's
consistent
with
the
text
because
the
diligence
has
to
be
connected
in
some
way
to
the
facts
supporting
the
claim,
and
we
think
you
could
take
the
view
that
in
a
case
of
this
type,
particularly
given
the
diligence
requirement,
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
either
means
the
facts
supporting
the
state
claim
or
it
means
the
vacatur
of
the
state
conviction.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
justice
souter,
the...
we
think
that
there's
a...
a
textual
problem
with
the
interpretation
you're
offering
because
it
doesn't
tie
diligence
to
facts
supporting
a
claim.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
because
it
avoids
the
problem
that
you
could
have
a
federal
conviction
long
after,
years
or
a
decade
or
a
more
after,
the
state
conviction.
and
on...
on
your
view,
you
would
not
be...
the...
the
petitioner
would
not
be
required
to
challenge
a
state
conviction
for
a
decade
or
more
until
after--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
souter,
an
argument
along
those
lines
was
actually
raised
in
daniels
itself
and
rejected
by
the
court.
and
essentially
what
the
court
said
is
that
whatever
the
incentives
may
be
at
the
time
of
the
state
conviction,
the
remedies
are
available,
the
procedures
are
available.
and
if
a
defendant
does
not
avail
himself
of
those
remedies
and
procedures,
at
a
minimum
he
will
know
that
so
long
as
his
state
conviction
remains
on
the
books,
if
he
goes
out
and
commits
another
crime,
he
runs
a
risk
that
he
will
be
subject
to
an
enhanced
sentence
based
on
the
fact
that
he's
committed
the
prior
crime.
we
think
the
same--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think
that--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
think
that
the
arguments
against
your
objection
weigh
in
favor
of
our
interpretation.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right.
under--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
under
paragraph
6(4),
what
you
say
is
absolutely
correct,
as
we
see
things.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
but
the...
the
limitation
period
under
aedpa
runs
from
the
latest
of
the
four
dates--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--let
me
comment
on
the
language,
if
i
could.
if
one
were
to
read
the
phrase,
facts
supporting
the
claim,
completely
in
isolation,
keeping
in
mind
only
daniels,
but
ignoring
the
broader
statutory
context
and
the
statutory
purpose,
it
might
well
be
the
case
that
the
better
reading
is
that
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
is
the
vacatur
of
the
state
conviction
not
the
factual
basis
for
the
state
claim.
but
if
you
take
into
account
the
broader
statutory
context
and
statutory
purpose,
in
particular
if
you
take
into
account
the
due
diligence
requirement,
we
think
the
better
reading
is
that
facts
supporting
the
claim,
in
the
context
of
this
limitation
provision,
is
the
factual
basis
for
the
state
claim.
it
is
true--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no,
justice
kennedy.
what
i
was
agreeing
to
was
the
idea
that
a
vacatur
of
a
conviction
is
a
fact
because
in
the
lower
court
decision,
there
seems
to
be
some
reliance
on
the
idea
that
that's
not
a
fact
at
all.
but
in
responding
to
justice
breyer's
question--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
and
here's
why.
it
is
a
true
in
a
case
of
this
type
that
the
facts
supporting
the
claim...
excuse
me...
the
factual
basis
for
the
state
claim
is
not
the
facts
supporting
the
federal
claim
in
a
direct
or
proximate
or
immediate
or
sufficient
sense.
it
is
the
facts
supporting
the
federal
claim
in
an
indirect,
a
but
for,
a
once
removed,
or
a
necessary
sense.
if
a
defendant
has
served
his
state
sentence,
he's
been
sentenced
to
an
enhanced
federal
sentence
and
he
wants
to
challenge
his
federal
sentence
and
he's
armed
with
a
factual
predicate
for
a
state
claim,
so
long
as
he
takes
the
intermediate
step
of
going
into
federal
court
and
obtaining
a
vacatur
of
the
conviction,
he
can
challenge
his
federal
sentence.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice
breyer,
under
our
view,
the
hypothetical
you
just
gave
would
be
one
where
a
timely
2255
motion
could
be
filed.
if
the
dna
evidence
were
discoverable
in
the
exercise
of
due
diligence
only
more
than
a
year
after
the
federal
conviction
became
final
such
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
within
paragraph
6(1),
he
would
be
able
to
file
a
timely
2255
motion
under
paragraph
6(4)
if,
within
a
year
from
the
date
that
the
dna
evidence
was
discoverable
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence,
he
filed
his
state
motion
to
get
his
state
conviction
vacated,
and
allowing
tolling
of
the
period
while
the
state
motion
is
pending,
then
filed
his
federal
motion
within
that
same
1-year
period,
he
would
be
able
to
file
a
timely
2255
motion.
that's
under
our
primary
interpretation.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
under
our
primary
interpretation,
there
would
be
tolling
during
the
1-year
period
of
the
time
while
the
motion,
the
state
motion,
is
pending
in
state
court.
our
alternative
interpretation
doesn't
depend
on
tolling
because
it
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
the
vacatur
of
the
state
conviction
could
have
been
obtained.
so
it's
just
the...
the
time
while
the
state
motion
is
pending
is
just
excluded
from
the
calculation
as
a
matter
of
course
under
our
second
interpretation.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
under...
under
the
guidelines,
depending
upon
the...
the
length
of
the
prison
term,
i
think
very
old
convictions
are
not
counted
at
all.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
yes.
so...
so
the
length
of
time
from
the
date
of
the
state
conviction
to
the
time
of
the
federal
sentencing
can
have
a
bearing
upon
what
sentence
he's
going--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--i...
i
don't
believe
it
is,
justice
souter.
i
don't
think
there's
any
kind
of
time
limitation
there
the
way
there
is
in
the
guidelines.
the...
the--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
that...
i
think
that's
actually
a
critical
point,
justice
kennedy,
because
our
view
is
that
a...
a
state
defendant
should
be
required
to
challenge
his
state
conviction
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity,
and
in
most
cases
that
will
be
soon
after
his
conviction
in
state
court
because
that
will
be
the
time
when
he
knows
about
the
basis
for
his
state
claim.
if
he
does
that,
by
the
time
he
gets
to
the
federal
sentencing,
you're
not
going
to
have
the
issue
in
this
case
because
all
will
agree
that
that
vacated
state
conviction
can't
be
counted
towards
his
federal
sentence.
so
that's
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
interpretation
we
offer.
it
avoids
this
circumstance
entirely.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that...
that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
we
agree
with
that.
the...
the
purpose
of
aedpa's
limitation
provision,
to
use
this
court's
language
in
duncan
v.
walker,
is
to
reduce
the
potential
for
delay
on
the
road
to
finality
by
restricting
the
time
that
a
prospective
habeas
petitioner
has
in
which
to
seek
habeas
review.
we
think
petitioner's
interpretation
is
inconsistent
with
that
purpose
not
only
because
it
permits
a
delay
in
challenging
the
state
conviction
and,
as
a
consequence,
in
challenging
the
federal
sentence,
but
because
it
encourages
it.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
longer
a
prisoner
waits
to
challenge
his
state
conviction,
other
things
being
the
same,
the
greater
the
likelihood
of
success
either
because
the
necessary
records
that
the
state
would
need
to
defend
the
judgment
are
unavailable
or
because
the
state
prosecutor
has
less
of
an
incentive
to
defend
it
than
he
might
have
while
the
sentence
was
still
being
served.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
our--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
the...
the
important
point
is
that...
we
think
is
that
petitioner's
interpretation
doesn't
work
because
it
gives
a
defendant
an
indefinite
period
to
challenge
his
state
conviction,
and
the
only
diligence
that's
required
under
his
interpretation
is
that
you
have
to
exercise
diligence
in
seeing
whether
the
motion
to
vacate
your
state
conviction
was
granted
whenever
it
was
filed.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--what's
wrong
with
it
is
that
we
think
it's
not
only
inconsistent
with
the
basic
principle
embodied
in
aedpa's
statute
of
limitations,
we
think
it's
inconsistent
with
the
very
idea
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
justice--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--justice
scalia,
if
the
court
rejects
our
view
that
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
under
paragraph
6(4)
as
the
factual
basis
for
the
state
claim,
we
think
it
should
still
reject
petitioner's
interpretation
and
should
adopt
our
alternative
interpretation
which
is
not
subject
to
that
objection
because
our
alternative
interpretation
assumes
that
the
facts
supporting
the
claim
is
the
vacatur
of
the
state
conviction.
but
in
light
of
the
due
diligence
requirement
at
the
end
of
paragraph
6(4),
the
question
is
when
could
that
vacatur
have
been
obtained
and
thus
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
that's
absolutely
our
position,
justice
souter.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
as
to
your
first
question,
justice
stevens,
one...
one
would
think
that
this
is
a
little
bit
of
an
unusual
situation
and
you
don't
see
too
many
cases
where
it
arises.
perhaps
surprisingly,
though,
there
are
quite
a
few
reported
decisions
where
this
arises.
there
is
a
2
to
1
circuit
split
on
this
question.
there
are
some
district
courts
from
other
circuits
that
have
weighed
in.
i
believe
there
may
be
three
or
four
certiorari
petitions
pending
in
this
court
from
the
eleventh
circuit
that
raise
the
same
question.
as
to
whether
congress
ever
considered
this
situation,
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
is
an
affirmative
indication
that
it
did.
it
could
well
be--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--that
could
well
be,
but
of
course,
it
wouldn't
be
the...
the
first
time
the
court
confronted
a
situation
where
there's
a
statutory
text
and
there's
a
set
of
facts
that
congress
didn't
necessarily
consider
when
it
was
writing
the
text.
so
we
think
our...
either
our
primary
or
our
fall-back
position
is
preferable
to
petitioner's
interpretation
for
the
fundamental
reason
that
his
interpretation
does
not
require
diligence.
it
enables
the
defendant
to
extend
the
limitation
period
through
his
own
actions,
and
we
think
it's
simply
foreign
to
the
whole
notion
of
statutes
of
limitations
to
say
that
the
limitation
period
can
be
determined
by
actions
that
are
within
the
prisoner's
control.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
question
of
whether
a
fact
supporting
a
claim
could
have
been
discovered
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence
is
a
very
fact-specific
question
which--
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
--no.
we
don't
think
so
because
we
think
that
the
analysis
should
be
the
same
for
this
case
as
it
is
for
your
typical
case
involving
a
statute
of
limitations
with
a
discovery
rule.
the
question
is
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
when
could
the
factual
basis
of
the
claim
been
discovered
given
the
totality
of
the
information
available
to
the
plaintiff
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
so
we
think
it's
precisely
the
same
situation.
mr.
dan
himmelfarb
well,
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
the
fall-back
position
presumes
the
correctness
of
petitioner's
interpretation
of
facts
supporting
the
claim.
