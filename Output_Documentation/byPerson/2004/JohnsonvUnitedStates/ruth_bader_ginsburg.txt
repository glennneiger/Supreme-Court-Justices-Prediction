justice
ruth
bader

well,
as
i
understood
justice
souter's
question,
it
is
the
alternate
that
the
government
said.
the
government
puts
forward
two
arguments,
and
its
alternate
argument
sounds
to
me
just
like
what
justice
souter
put
to
you,
that
is,
he
has
to
move
diligently
to
challenge
those
underlying
convictions,
that
he
cannot
challenge
in
federal
court
because
of...
was
it...
curtis
and
daniels.
why
isn't
that
an...
an
accommodation
of
what
we
know
was
the
concern
of
the
federal
court...
of
the...
of
the
congress
that
people
act
diligently?
it
happens
that
2255
wasn't
framed
with
curtis
and
daniels
in
mind.
there
isn't
any
indication
that
the
drafters
of
2255
were
aware
of
this
peculiar
situation
where
you
can't
make
the
challenge
in
federal
court,
you
must
go
back
to
the
state
forum.
but
we
do
know
they
were
concerned
with
diligence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you...
you
have
to
concede
that
you
are
watering
down
almost
to
nothing
any
due
diligence
requirement
because
on
your
reading
of
the
statute,
there
isn't...
there
isn't
any
such
requirement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know...
i
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even...
that
was
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask.
with
respect
to...
he
came
into
federal
court
and
he
said...
a
little...
like
3
days
too
late
to
move
to
extend
the
time
to
file
the
2255.
that
motion
was
denied.
that
motion
was
made
in
april
of
'97,
and
then
he
doesn't
file
for
state
habeas
to
get
rid
of
those
prior
convictions
until
february
of
'98.
is...
is
there
any
indication
of
why,
when
the
federal
court
says
we're
not
going
to
extend
your
time,
he
waits
so
long
to
go
to
the
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
from
your
answer,
i
take
it
then
you
would
agree
with
judge
black
in
the
eleventh
circuit
that
equitable
tolling
would
apply.
he
goes
to
state
court
within
the
year
after
his
federal
conviction
becomes
final.
the
state
court
is
sitting
on
it
for
2
years.
the
limitation,
i
take
it
from
what
you
said,
would
be
tolled
during
that
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not...
you're
not
insisting
on
that
super
diligence
because
you
say,
well,
in
every
case
he
has
at
least
a
year
to
begin
to
try
to
undo
the
state
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
you
need
the
placeholder
if
the
rule
were,
as
judge
black
said
it
should
be,
that
if
you
go
to
the
state
court
within
the
1
year
after
your
federal
conviction
becomes
final,
then
the
time
that
you
are
in
the
state
court
the
statute
will
be
tolled?
if
that's
the
rule,
then
you
don't
need
any
placeholder
filings.
