justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
any
event,
you
pointed
out
that
on
the
face
there
is
the
distinction
on
the
face
of
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
is
not
a
disparate
impact
case
at
all--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
it
affects
only
indigents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
saying
this
is
case
like
douglas
which
was
equal
protection,
like
a
free
transcript,
like
a
filing
fee
for
an
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
bracketing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
just...
but
that's
just
boiler
plate,
isn't
it?
that's
what
they
say
in
all
these
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
michigan
cites
a
michigan
supreme
court
decision
that
says
it's
not
on
the
merits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
people
v.
berry?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
the
same
if
the...
if
it's
a
discretionary
appeal
at
the
intermediate
appellate
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
something
the
intermediate
appellate
court
has
said?
have
they
said
that,
that...
we
have
a...
a
discretionary
appeal,
but
every...
in
every
case
it's
a
merits
decision?
we
don't
have
any
decisions
that
say
we
are
exercising
our
discretion
not
to
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
moran.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
moran,
before
your...
your
time
is
up,
i
did
want
to
know
what
is
your
position
on...
let's
say
that
there
is...
you
prevail
and
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
for
these
applications
to
appeal.
and
if
counsel
looks
at
the
case
and
determines
that
there
is
no
tenable
ground
for
an
appeal,
could
counsel
file
the
equivalent
of
an
anders
brief?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
restuccia,
the...
we
are
dealing
here,
as
is
not
uncommon,
with
someone
who
is
learning
disabled,
mentally
impaired,
and
the
trial
court
did
not
say
if
you
plead,
you
relinquish
your
right
to
counsel
in
seeking
leave
to
appeal.
it
said
only
when...
if
this
exists,
i
must,
and
if
that
exists,
i
must,
but
did
not
say
if
you
plead,
you
relinquish
your
right
to
counsel
in
seeking
leave
to
appeal.
and
i
was
curious
as
a
matter
of
what
is
going
on
in
michigan
trial
courts
now.
do
judges
routinely
tell
defendants
who
plead
guilty...
tell
them
not
only
when
the
court
must
give
them
counsel,
but
if
you
plead,
you
relinquish
your
right
to
counsel
in
seeking
leave
to
appeal?
because
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
never
imparted
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
apparently
the
people
who...
who
redid
the
model
instructions
thought
that
this
would
be
a
clearer
one,
to
tell
him
up
front
you
don't
get
counsel
if
you
don't
fit
under
these
exceptions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why...
if
it's
just
denying...
or
not
granting
appeal,
why
does
it
use
the
boiler
plate,
for
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
of
mr....
mr.
moran's
point
that
this...
whatever
the
merits
are,
it
counts
as
law
of
the
case
and
it's...
it
conclusively
determines
the
issues
presented?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
that...
it's
not
that
sharp
because
it
was...
in
ross,
it
was
the
second
appeal.
so
here
we
have
one
factor
that
is
like
douglas,
griffin,
and
one
factor
that's
like
ross.
you
can't
say
that
it
falls
in
one
camp
more
than
the
other.
this
is
the
first-tier
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
case
is
halbert
against
michigan
no.03-10198.
the
federal
constitution’s
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses,
we
have
held,
oblige
a
state
to
appoint
counsel
for
indigent
criminal
defendants
including
defendants
found
guilty
after
trial
who
seek
to
appeal
from
their
convictions.
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
does
that
right
to
counsel
extend
to
poor
persons
who
are
convicted
on
guilty
or
no
contest
pleas
but
wish
to
pursue
certain
issues
on
appeal,

petitioner,
halbert
was
convicted
of
criminal
sexual
conduct
on
a
no
contest
plea
in
a
michigan
trial
court.
he
is
unable
to
pay
for
counsel.
until
1994,
michigan
accorded
defendants
who
plead
guilty
or
no
contest
a
right
to
appeal
and
appointed
counsel
if
the
defendant
was
too
poor
to
pay.
by
amendment
to
the
state’s
constitution
and
corresponding
statutory
change,
michigan
adopted
its
current
system
under
which
defendants
who
entered
guilty
or
no
contest
pleas
have
no
automatic
right
to
appeal,
they
must
petition
for
leave
to
do
so,
and
except
for
certain
circumstances
specified
in
the
governing
statute,
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
state
provided
counsel
to
assist
them
in
seeking
leave
to
appeal.

but

left
to
act
on
his
own,
halbert
applied
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
that
court
denied
his
application
using
the
boiler
plate
expression
for
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented.
the
michigan
supreme
court
thereafter
declined
to
consider
his
case.
halbert
maintains
that
the
federal
constitution's
access
to
court
guarantees
render
michigan’s
current
law
invalid.
we
agree
and
accordingly
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
two
prior
decisions
of
this
court
guide
today’s
judgment:
the
first
douglas
v.
california
decided
in
1963
held
that
when
a
first
appeal
is
a
matter
of
right,
counsel
must
be
appointed
to
represent
a
defendant
too
poor
to
engage
a
lawyer;
the
second
ross
v.
moffitt
decided
in
1974
concerns
second-tier
review
by
a
state's
highest
court
review
that
is
not
a
matter
of
right
but
requires
court
permission.
we
held
counsel
need
not
be
appointed
for
such
second-tier
discretionary
review.
halbert’s
case
falls
between
those
two
guiding
decisions.
he
seeks
access
to
first
year
review.
review
in
an
intermediate
appellate
court
and
to
that
extent,
his
case
is
like
douglas.
but
under
michigan
law
the
appeal
halbert
seeks
though
first
level
is
not
a
matter
of
right,
so
in
that
regard,
his
case
is
like
ross.
for
reasons
detailed
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
halbert's
case
is
properly
ranked
with
douglas
rather
than
ross.
accordingly
the
state
must
appoint
counsel
to
help
halbert
apply
for
leave
to
pursue
his
first
and
likely
only
appeal.
two
factors
are
of
prime
importance
to
our
ruling:
first,
michigan’s
intermediate
appellate
court
rules
on
leave
applications
by
deciding
whether
the
applicants
claim
has
sufficient
merit
to
warrant
full
consideration.
review
in
the
states’
highest
court
in
contrast
is
determined
not
by
the
presence
of
errors
in
the
trial
court
proceedings
but
generally
by
the
public
importance
of
the
issue
presented.
there
is
thus
a
considerable
difference
between
highest
court
discretionary
review
and
first-tier
inspection
of
a
conviction
by
an
intermediate
appellate
court
whether
upright
or
on
application.
second,
the
indigent
defendant
is
ill
equipped
to
navigate
without
counsel’s
aim,
michigan’
complex
procedures
for
seeking
leave
to
appeal.
unlike
second-tier
review,
at
the
first
appellate
tier,
there
will
have
been
no
prior
examination
of
the
case
by
an
appellate
counsel
and
court.
moreover,
the
typical
defendant
in
halbert
situation
has
had
little
education,
many
like
halbert
himself
suffer
learning
disabilities
or
mental
impairments.
we
note
too
that
halbert
did
not
intelligently
forego
any
appeal
right
when
halbert
elected
to
plea
no
contest
the
trial
court
did
not
conveyed
to
him
in
plain
english
that
if
he
gave
up
his
right
to
trial
he
will
have
to
pursue
any
appeal
from
his
conviction
or
sentence
on
his
own.
