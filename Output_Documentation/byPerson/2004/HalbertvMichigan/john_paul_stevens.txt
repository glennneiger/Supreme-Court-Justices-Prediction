justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
understand
one
point
that
justice
scalia's
question
raises
for
me?
in
your
view,
is
the
provision
of
counsel
for
the
indigent
for
appellate
purposes
purely
a
matter
of
grace,
or
was
there
some
underlying
obligation
to
provide
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
for
aedpa
purposes,
they
treat
the
intermediate
decision
as
a
decision
on
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
opponent
has
misrepresented
michigan
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
says
there
are
dozens
of
cases
at
the
district
court
level
that
apply
aedpa
in
the
way
he
described.
is
that
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he
didn't,
but
do
you
think
he's
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
he's
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
at
page
36
of
your
brief
that
you
agreed
that
he
made
a
correct...
that
there
was
an
error
in...
of
application.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
were
at
least
two
errors.
how
they
balance
out
i
guess
is
your
view
they
didn't
hurt
him
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct?
there
were
two
errors
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
least.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
contends
there
were
two
more,
and
that
hasn't
been
resolved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at...
at
least
we
have
to
assume
that
it
was
not
an
error-free
sentencing
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
am
i
correct
in
assuming
from
the
order
entered
on
page
43
of
the
joint
appendix
that
even
though
there
were
lots
of
errors
there,
the
fact
that
they
were
not
raised
until
after
december
11th
would
have
precluded
review
at
the
trial
court
level?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
counsel
happens
to
be
incompetent,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
if
he
had
had
paid
counsel,
he
would
not
have
had
these
handicaps.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
saying...
i
just
want
to
be
clear...
that
even
if
this
defendant
had
had
paid
counsel,
he
would
not
have
had
any
right
to
appeal
to
the
intermediate
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
question
is
whether
the
words,
of
right,
were
essential
to
that
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
then
it
wouldn't
have
needed
to
include
the
word
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
the
word
first
was
redundant,
not
the
words,
of
right.
