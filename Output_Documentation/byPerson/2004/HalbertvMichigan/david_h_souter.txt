justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't...
i'm...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
wouldn't
your
position
be
different
if
he
had
been
advised
that
he
had
exactly
the
right
that
you
claim
he
has,
and
the
court
said,
however,
in
michigan
you
may
not
enter
the...
the
plea
unless
you
waive
that
right?
if...
if
you
don't
want
to
waive
that
right,
which
i've
just
explained
to
you,
we'll...
we'll
have
a
trial.
would...
would
your
answer
still
be
that...
that
waiver
would
be
as
a
matter
of
law
impossible?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
ultimately
your
case
rests
not
on
equal
protection
but
due
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
one
as
much
as
the
other,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you're...
we're
saying
if
you're
going
to
provide
a
first
appeal
of
right,
one
incident
of
that
is,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
you've
got
to
provide
counsel.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're...
you're
saying
that
the
due
process
is
what
gets
you
beyond
the
stage
of
merely
providing
counsel
as
a
matter
of
grace.
that's
what
due
process
does
for
you.
because
they
have
to
provide
counsel
not
merely
as
a
matter
of
grace,
you
have
a
very
clear
equal
protection
case
which
you
would
not
otherwise
have.
isn't...
isn't
that
the
way
the
two
work
together?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so,
in
effect,
it's
discretionary
in
the
sense
that
it's
discretionary
as
to
whether
to
give
it
full-dress
treatment,
but
the
bottom
line,
whether
they
give
it
full
dress
or...
or
merely
discretionary
denial
is...
is
an
implication
on
the
merits.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
wouldn't
we
have
to
conclude
that
if
we're
going
to
apply
the
same
standards
here
that
we
usually
do
in...
in
the
plea
waiver
situation?
i
mean,
we...
the...
the
classic
point
of
it
all
is
the
knowing...
the...
the
intelligent,
voluntary
waiver
of
a
known
right.
and
leaving
aside
the
equal
protection
problem
here,
even
if
we
didn't
have
that,
i
don't
see
that
there
would
be...
have
been
an
adequate
waiver
here
because
he
was
never
told
that
he
had
the
right
that
he
now
claims
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
you
indeed,
dispute
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
unless
he
were
told
that,
the...
the
waiver
that...
that
depends
upon
parsing
the
difference
between
must
and
may
in
the
two
paragraphs
of
explanation
certainly
wouldn't
be
taken
as
the
predicate
for
a
waiver
of
a
known
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the...
the
appeal
of
his
right...
the
appeal
as
of
right
point,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
different
point.
what
they're
getting
at
there
is
it
will
be
discretionary
with
the
reviewing
court
whether
your
case
is
reviewed
on
the
merits
on
some
point
if
you
ask
for
it.
we're
here
dealing
with
the
right
to
counsel,
and
it
seems
to
me
unless
he
were
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
counsel
that
he
claims
and
he
then
waived
it,
that
there
wouldn't
be
a...
an...
an
adequate
waiver
under
boykin.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
going
on...
on
record
as
saying
that
michigan
does
not
and
will
not,
in
the
united
states
courts,
claim
any
aedpa
deference
as
a
result
of
one
of
these
determinations?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
have
not
been...
and...
and
michigan
lawyers
have
not
been
advancing
that
claim
in
the
district
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
so
far
as
you
can
tell,
that's
the
way
it's
been.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
was
the
same
court,
though,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what...
what
about
preclusion
on
other
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
litigation
in
other
courts.
they...
did...
did
they
ever
say
there
is
no
claim
or
issue
preclusion
in
other
courts
as
a
result
of...
of
our
denials?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
any...
any
court,
i
mean,
in...
in
theory,
can...
can
revise
its
own...
its
own
opinions.
but
the...
i
mean,
we
look
to
preclusion
really
on...
on
the
effect
of
the
judgment
in
another
court,
and
i
take
it
they
have
not
ruled
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
may...
may
i
ask
you
one
thing
lest
we
forget
it?
is...
is
your
argument
premised
on
the
assumption
that
a
refusal
to
hear
an
appeal
is...
is
not
regarded
as
a
determination
on
the
merits
and
thus--
preclusive?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
i'm
asking
whether
that's
a
premise
of
your
argument
because
the
consequences
of
your
argument
are
going
to
be
very
different
depending
on
whether
that
is
the
premise
or
whether
it
isn't,
whether
that
premise
is
true
or
whether
it
isn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your...
the
assumption
of
your
argument
is
that
it
is
not
on
the
merits.
i.
e.,
it
is
not
a
merits
determination
if
there's
a
denial
and
hence
there
is
no
preclusion.
