mr.
david
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether,
42
years
after
this
court
decided
in
douglas
v.
california
that
indigent
defendants
have
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
for
a
first-tier
direct
felony
appeal--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it
did
not,
your
honor.
it
was
a
trial
case.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
did
not.
none
of
this
court's
cases
in
the
douglas
line
have
turned
on
whether
the
conviction
was
by
trial
or
by
plea.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor,
because
as
mr.
halbert's
case
demonstrates,
all
sorts
of
difficult,
technical
issues
can
arise
in
a
guilty
plea.
of
course,
certain
issues
are
waived.
trial
issues
are
waived
by
the
effect
of
a
guilty
plea,
but
many
other
issues
remain.
and
as
mr.
halbert's
case
demonstrates,
especially
in
the
guilty
plea
cases...
this
court
well
knows
the
effect
of
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines...
very
complicated
issues
of
sentencing
law
arise.
and
now
michigan
has
a
sentencing
guideline
system
that
is
perhaps
more
complicated
than
the
federal
system
that's
been
in
effect
since
the
1980's.
mr.
david
a.
moran
he
did
not
waive
a
right
to
file
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal.
because
of
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--he
waived
the
right
to
have
a...
to
have
what
is
called
in
michigan
an
automatic
appeal,
in
other
words,
the
right
to
automatically
have
full
briefing
and
oral
argument.
so
what
he
agreed
to
by
pleading
was
to
go
through
the
application
for
leave
to
appeal
procedure
which
involves
a
preliminary
determination
of
merit
as
to
whether
the
appeal
should
proceed.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
he
did
not...
first
of
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
not.
he
was
never
told
at
any
point
during
the
plea
proceedings
that
he
would
be
giving
up
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
he
was
told
that
under
certain
circumstances
the
judge
would
appoint
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
the
judge
never
said,
under
any
other
circumstances,
i
will
not
appoint
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
might
be
a
natural
inference
for
somebody
with
a
level
of
sophistication,
but
mr.
halbert
is
a
special
education
student,
functionally
illiterate.
and
nobody
explained
to
him
that
he
wouldn't
be
given
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
hope
the
latter,
justice
kennedy,
because
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
state
is
making
a
waiver
argument.
and,
of
course,
the
waiver
argument
is
not
part
of...
is
not
the
intent
of
the
statute.
what
the
statute
does
is
it
tacks
on
and,
by
the
way,
the
defendant
should
be
advised
at
the
time
of
the
plea
that
they
won't
be
getting
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
absolutely.
mr.
david
a.
moran
absolutely,
we
would
because
that
is
a
waiver
that
is
designed
to
extract
only
from
the
poor.
that
waiver
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
those
with
money
because,
in
fact,
a
money
defendant
is
not
even
eligible
for
appointed
counsel
on
appeal.
so
that
waiver
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it
would
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
money
defendants
i'm
saying.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
waiver
would
be
unconstitutional
under
those
conditions
because
it
is
a
discriminatory
waiver.
to
show
how
breathtaking
the
state's
argument--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
as
this
court
has
long
recognized,
a
trial
provides
very
substantial
benefit.
i
mean,
excuse
me.
a
guilty
plea
provides
very
substantial
benefits.
and
so
the
effect
of
the
michigan
statute
then
would
be
only
the
money
defendant
can
receive
the
benefits
of
a
guilty
plea
and
then
have
sentencing
errors
corrected.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
well,
not
only
that,
if
the
state's
waiver
argument
is
correct,
then
presumably
the
state
could
extract
a
waiver
saying
you
can't
have
free
transcripts.
you
can't
have
the
waiver
of
the
filing
fees.
in
fact,
the
state
could
extract
a
waiver
saying
you
can't
have
counsel
at
sentencing.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
justice
scalia,
i
actually
have
two
responses
to
that.
first,
this
is
intentionally
aimed
at
the
poor.
looking
at
770.3a,
the
statute
under...
in
question
here,
it
is
clearly
aimed
at
the
indigent.
it
refers
to
the
indigent.
so
this
is
a
statute
that
on
its
face
is...
is
taking
away
the
right
of
the
indigent
and
only
the
indigent
to
have...
have
an
attorney.
so
i
don't
agree
that
is
is
a...
simply
a
disparate
impact
case.
but
in
the
context
of
appellate
counsel
for
a
first-tier
felony
appeal,
this
court's
cases
have...
have
not
applied
the
same
line
of
analysis
that
this
court
has
applied
in
other
contexts,
and
i
think
that's
quite
clear
most
recently
in
the
mlb
case--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
there
is
no
question
that
this
statute
was
enacted
for
and
specifically
applies
only
to
the
indigent.
it
has...
it
has
no
impact
whatsoever
on
the
wealthy,
and
it's
aimed
at
the...
at
the
indigent
only.
so
i
do...
i
do
not
agree
that
this--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it's
not
a...
a
disparate
impact
claim
i
say,
because
it
is
intentionally
aimed
at
the
poor.
the
statute
was
designed
to
take
away
counsel
from
the
poor
and
only
from
the
poor.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
not
saying
any,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
a.
moran
this
case
certainly
is.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
this
case...
in
many
ways
the
restrictions
that
are
placed
on
the
indigent's
ability
to
appeal
in
michigan,
as
a
result
of
this
statute,
are
worse
than
those
that
were
struck
down
in
douglas
because
at
least
in
douglas
the
court,
the
appellate
court,
would
review
the
entire
transcript,
looking
for
arguable
issues.
we
don't
even
have
that
here.
all
we
have
here
is
the
indigent
forced
to
shift
for
himself,
forced
to
try
and
determine
whether
there
are
any
issues,
forced
to
order
his
own
transcript.
under
the
michigan
statute,
the
indigent
has
to
figure
out
how
to
obtain
his
or
her
docket
entries,
his
or
her
transcripts,
his
or
her
prisoner
account
statements,
all
the
documents
necessary
for
filing
a
first
appeal
that
would
ordinarily
be
done
by
counsel.
and
so--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--oh,
it's
my...
it's
certainly
my
contention,
justice
stevens,
that
michigan
is
required
to
afford
appellate
counsel
in
this
situation
for
a
first
tier
direct
felony
appeal
on
the
merits.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it's
a
merger
of
both
principles,
as
this
court
said--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
is
directed--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it
is
directed
against
the
poor,
which
is
why
there
is
an
equal
protection
component
to
this
argument,
but
this
court's
cases--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
believe
that's
right.
it's...
it's
difficult...
i
have
to
confess,
your
honor,
it's
difficult
sometimes
to
separate
out
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
strands
from
the
griffin
and
douglas,
and
this
court
most
recently
in
mlb
said
that
there
is
a
certain
merger.
also,
i
believe
in
smith
v.
robbins
this
court
reiterated
that
there
is
a
certain
merger
of
the
lines
in
these
cases.
but
there--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
think
that's
right,
justice
souter.
i
think
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
a
question
this
court
hasn't
decided,
and
i
don't
have
a
position
on
that.
but
that's
far
different
from
this
case
because
that
would
not
be
discriminatory.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
don't.
and
that...
that
case
has
not
come
before
this
court
yet,
and
so
i
don't
know
how
this
court
would
decide
that
case
if
it
comes.
i
know
some
of
the
federal
circuits
have
upheld
such
appellate
waivers
as
a
part
of
a
negotiated
guilty
plea.
one
thing
the
michigan
statute
is...
does
is
it
takes
away
the
right
to
appeal
effectively
for
indigents
without
negotiation.
it's...
it's
the
baseline.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but,
your
honor,
the
problem
is...
is
that
the
statute
requires
only
the
poor,
imposes
a
forced
waiver
on
only
the
poor.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
an
equal
protection
claim.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
really
not
sure
that
you
can
separate
out
the
two
strands
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
again,
and
i
know
this
court
didn't
try
in
mlb,
and
i
know
this
court
didn't
try
in
smith
v.
robbins,
so
that
there
is...
there
is
a
component
of
both.
and
it's
precisely
because
of
these
sorts
of
questions
that
i
think
you
have
to
view
them
as
an
integrated
whole
for
purposes
of
the
griffin/douglas
line.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
it's
my
position
there
was
no
waiver,
but
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
the
plea
proceeding.
it's
the
plea
proceeding.
and
it's--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it's...
it's
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--beginning
on
page
19.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
that's
my
position--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if
an
indigent,
after
being
sentenced,
decided
for
whatever
reason
i
would
prefer
to
go
on
appeal
by
myself,
which
is
actually
a...
a
right
this
court
rejected
in
martinez,
that
you
have
a
right
to
represent
yourself
on
appeal,
but
in
michigan
an
indigent
is
allowed
to...
would
be
allowed
to
represent
himself
or
herself
on
appeal
if
they
chose
to
do
so.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
statute
purports
to
take
away
the
right,
and
it's
our
position
that
this
is
a
constitutional--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that's
right.
we
have
no
problem
with
a
voluntary
waiver.
we
certainly
have
a
problem
with
a
forced
waiver
saying
that
you
cannot
enter
a
plea
which
produces
tremendous
benefits
in
michigan,
as
everywhere
else,
unless...
unless
you
agree
to
waiver--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
take
no
position
on
that.
it
may
or
may
not
permissible.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
it's
far
different
because
that's
something
that
can
be
obtained
in
negotiation.
but
what
we
would
have--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no.
that
was
effective.
that...
that's
referring
to
the
automatic
appeal
that
he
would
have
if
he
went
to
trial
where
he
would
have
full
briefing
and
oral
argument.
the
michigan--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no,
it
doesn't.
this
was
a...
this
was
a
pretty
poor
waiver
proceeding
in
a
number
of...
of
respects,
but
it--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
he
was.
mr.
david
a.
moran
he
did.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
justice
breyer,
i
agree.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
believe--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i...
i
believe
the
state
might
dispute
that.
i'm
not
sure.
what
the
michigan
constitution
does,
justice
o'connor,
if
i
may
come
back
to
your
question,
is
it
says
that
for
somebody
who
pleads
guilty
or
nolo
contendere,
they
are
giving
up
the
right
to
the
automatic
appeal,
and
they
have...
they
then
have
to
proceed
by
the
application
for
leave
to
appeal.
and
so
the
michigan
constitution
explicitly
still
provides
a
right
to
appeal,
but
it
changes
the
method.
and
so
michigan's
appeal,
after
a
guilty
plea
now,
is
like
the
first
appeal
in
several
other
states,
virginia,
west
virginia,
and...
and
several
other
states
have
guilty
plea
appeals.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it's
framed
in
terms
of
a...
of
a
right.
page
2
of
the
brief--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
it's
a...
it's...
what
michigan
has
done
is
it
has
changed
the
method
of
the
appeal.
and
so
virginia,
for
example,
has
first-tier
appeals
by
petition.
west
virginia
has
a
first-tier
by
petition
and--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes,
justice
scalia,
but
that's
not
how
the...
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
works.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
an
error-correcting
court.
and
so
in
mr.
halbert's
case,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
denied
his
appeal,
after
his
futile
attempt
to...
to
identify
his
issues,
with
an
order
saying
that
there
was
a
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented.
that
is
a
preclusive
decision
on
the
merits
of
his
case.
that--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
that--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
that
was
a
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
referring
to
its
own
orders
denying
applications
for
leave
to
appeal
which
are
not
on
the
merits.
the
michigan
supreme
court
denies
the
applications
for
saying...
by
saying,
we
are
not
persuaded
that
we
should
hear
the
questions
presented.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
unlike
the
michigan
supreme
court,
is
an
error
correcting
court.
and
so
it
issues
orders
saying
denied
for
lack
of
merit.
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
dozens
and
dozens
of
times
in
the
last
25
years
has
said,
without
exception,
that
is
a
decision
on
the
merits
that
precludes
relitigation
under
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
called
it
a
discretionary
appeal,
justice
scalia,
without
ever
explaining
why,
and
the...
the
dissent
in
bulger
pointed
out
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
an
error-correcting
court.
and
in
fact,
the
very
author
of
the--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
right,
but
the
very
author
of
the
opinion
in
bulger,
chief
justice
corrigan,
just
1
year
later
or
2
years
later
describes
the
effect
of...
of
an
order
denying
leave
to
appeal
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
and
says
it
clearly
shows
they
considered
and
rejected
the
merits.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
exactly
as
in
virginia.
in
jackson
v.
virginia,
the
court
recognized
that
the...
the
virginia
situation
is
exactly
the
same,
that
there
is
a
petition
to
appeal
to
the
virginia
court
of
appeals,
and
that
each
petition
is
considered
on
the
merits,
and
a
denial
of
the
petition
is
seen
as
a
decision
on
the
merits
that
precludes
relitigation
under
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine.
and
so
michigan's
appeal
after
a
guilt
plea
now
is
exactly
like
the
one
in
virginia.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if
a...
if
a
appeal
or
an
application
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
filed
in
the
wrong
form
or
is
untimely
or
has
some
other
defect,
then
the
court
will
occasionally
issue
an
order
denying
the
application
for
that
reason.
but
for
any
properly
filed
application
for
leave
to
appeal,
the
longstanding
practice
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
to
say
it
is
denied
for
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented.
mr.
david
a.
moran
and
they
do.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
after
abela
v.
martin
in
the
sixth
circuit.
and
there
is
a...
a
whole
host
of
federal
district
court
decisions
in
the
eastern
and
western
district
of
michigan
all
saying
that
when
an
order
is
denied
for
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented,
the
aedpa
standard
of
review
applies.
and
so
the
state
obtains
tremendous
benefits
from
this
procedure.
they
obtain
deference
on
habeas
corpus
review.
they
prevent
the
indigent,
if
the
indigent
were
to
ever
get
a
lawyer
at
some
later
stage,
from
beginning
relitigation
on
state
collateral
review.
and
so
the
state
very
happily
argues
for
all
of
those
purposes
that
this
is
a
decision
on
the
merits,
but
then
they
come
before
this
court
and
they
say,
oh,
no,
it's
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.
it's
really
discretionary
despite
what
it
says
because
they
are
hoping
that
this
court
will
conclude
that
it
is
a
discretionary
appeal.
in
fact,
the
state--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--has
made
an
even
more
radical
argument
in
its
brief.
the
state
maintains
that
the
appeal
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
a
second-tier
appeal,
and
that
is
plainly
contrary
to
the...
to
the
actual
function
of
that
court
because
there
is
a
provision
that
if
trial
counsel
suddenly
realizes
in
a
plea
case,
after
sentencing,
that
there
are
issues
that
she
should
have
raised,
it
allows
her
to
do
that.
and
so
the
state
now
argues
that
that's
really
the
first-tier
appeal,
and
then
the
application
that
follows
after
that
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
a
second-tier
appeal.
i'll
just
point
out
that
even
the
state's
amicus
doesn't
agree
with
that,
and...
and
rightfully
so
in
light
of
swenson
v.
bosler,
which
has
rejected
an
attempt
to
reorganize
by
labeling
how
one's
appeals
go.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
in
fact,
i
have
done
that
personally.
before
i
became
an
academic,
i
worked
at
the
state
appellate
defender
office
in
detroit
and
was
appointed
to
represent
indigents
on
plea
appeals.
and
in
a
significant
percentage
of
the
cases...
i
can't
quote
you
the
numbers
off
the
top
of
my
head...
after
reviewing
the
case,
the
appellate
counsel
then
concludes
that
there
is
no
merit,
that
there
are
no
grounds
to
proceed,
that
the
defendant
in
fact
got
whatever
it
was
she
bargained
for
in
the
plea
bargaining,
at
which
point
then
either
a
motion
to
withdraw
may
be
filed
or...
or
the
equivalent,
the
michigan
equivalent,
of
an
anders
brief.
and
so
that
is
done
in
a
number
of
cases.
it
is
our
position
that
that
procedure
actually
helps
improve
the
appellate
process
in
michigan
because
without
that
process,
all
you
have
are
indigents
like
mr.
halbert,
a
special
education
student
with
mental
disabilities,
trying
to
identify
his
own
issues
and
fall...
and
filing,
in...
in
his
case,
with
the
help
of
a
fellow
prisoner
because
he
could
not
have
done
it
himself...
the
help
of
a
fellow
prisoner,
an
application
that
is
completely
incoherent,
misses
several
issues
that
are
right
on
the
face
of
the
record,
correctly
asserts
that
his
sentencing
guidelines
were
misscored
but...
but
without
explaining
why,
without
even
identifying
which
sentencing
guidelines
were
misscored.
and
in
fact,
he
received
a
minimum
sentence
that
was
approximately
three
times
too
high
under
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
state
concedes
that
one
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
was
scored
in
the
state's
favor
erroneously.
we
concede
one
of
the...
one
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
was
scored
in
mr.
halbert's
favor
erroneously.
but
then
there
were
two
others,
and
the
most
important
ones,
the
ov,
offense
variable,
13.
that
was
scored
for
25
points
in
both
cases.
and
so
mr....
mr.
halbert,
in
fact,
received
a
sentence
that
was
much
too
high.
michigan
requires...
michigan
is
one
of
the
few
states
that
requires
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
be
raised
on
direct
appeal
or
they're
lost.
and
so
at
that
point,
mr.
halbert
had
to
figure
out
a
way
to
raise
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
hearing,
which
requires
an
evidentiary
hearing
at
which
trial
counsel
must
be
called,
assuming
trial
counsel
is
still
available
to
be
called,
all
from
prison,
and
there
was
no
possible
way
he
could
do
that.
so
it's
not
very
surprising
that
even
with
the
help
of
a
fellow
inmate,
that
his
application
for
leave
to
appeal
was
completely
incoherent.
the
fellow
inmate
actually
did
write
the...
the
trial
judge
and
say
we
need
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
but
under
the
statute,
the
judge
had
no
discretion
to
grant
that
motion.
under
the
statute,
only
if
there
was
already
an
upward
departure
from
the
sentencing
guidelines,
only
then
would
the
judge
be
required
to
appoint
counsel,
and
of
course,
the
guidelines,
as
misscored
without
objection
from
defense
counsel...
there
was
no
upward
departure
at
that
point.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
moran
thank
you.
i
have
to
begin
by
correcting
several
misstatements
of
fact
and
of
michigan
law.
first
of
all,
mr.
schaerr
just
said
that
only
a
dozen
states,
i
believe,
allow
for
appeals
from
guilty
pleas.
that's
not
correct.
every
state
in
the
united
states
currently
allows
for
appeals
from
guilty
plea...
pleas.
the
bulger
case
did
say
that.
they
cited
a--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--not
necessarily.
as
i
cited
in
my
brief,
a
number
of
states
allow
for
applications
or
petitions
from
guilty
pleas,
but
every
state
has
a
first
tier
direct
appeal
from
guilty
pleas.
the
bulger...
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
bulger
cited
a...
an
article
from
an
arizona
attorney
magazine
that
was
simply
incorrect
on
that.
secondly,
on
the
issue
of
what
is
the
effect
of
a
order
denying
leave
to
appeal
for
lack
of
merit
on
the
grounds
presented,
the
state
continues
to
rely
on
mckenzie
v.
smith,
an
earlier
sixth
circuit
opinion,
people
v.
berry,
and
bobenal
v.
saginaw
investment.
none
of
those
cases
uses
the
phrase,
lack
of
merit
on
the
grounds
presented.
that
phrase
does
not
appear
in
any
of
those
three
cases.
the
berry
and
the
bobenal
cases,
those
are
michigan
court
of
appeals
cases
before
1981.
beginning
in
1981,
in
a
series
of
three
cases,
people
v.
douglas,
people
v.
hayden,
and
people
v.
wiley,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
held
unambiguously
that
our
orders
denying
applications
or
remand
orders,
in
that
case,
for
lack
of
merit
on
the
grounds
presented,
was
law
of
the
case.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i'm
sorry?
i...
i
don't--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--the
michigan
constitutional
provision?
it
changes
the
way
in
which
guilty
plea
appeals
proceed.
before
1994,
there
were
other
types
of
appeals
that
had
to
proceed
by
application
for
leave
to
appeal,
primarily
latent
appeals.
if
the
appeal
was
filed
too
late,
it
had
to
proceed
by
application
for
leave
to
appeal.
in
1994,
as
a
result
of
the
constitutional
amendment,
guilt
plea
appeals
now
have
to
proceed
by
application
for
leave
to
appeal.
that's
constitutional.
we
have
no
problem
with
that,
and
that
is
the
method
by
which
the
caseload
management
problems
have
been
solved.
they
have
been
solved.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the...
i
assume
you're
still
referring
to
article
i,
section
20
of
the
michigan
constitution.
mr.
david
a.
moran
they
were
saying
that
first-tier
felony
appeals
in
michigan
following
pleas
require
leave
of
the
court,
require
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal,
like
latent
appeals
from
trial
cases
do.
but
all
of
those
appeals
are
still
decided
on
the
merits
with
preclusive
effect
for
law
of
the
case
purposes.
and
the
sixth
circuit
specifically
dealt
with
that
in...
in
the
abela
case.
mckenzie
v.
smith
never...
never
mentions
anything
about
the
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented.
the
resource
allocations
point
is
simply
that
not
all
of
these
guilty
plea
appeals
are...
lead
to
full
argument
and
full
briefing,
and
that's
fine.
michigan
can
do
that.
but
what
michigan
cannot
do,
as
a
result
of
ellis
and
douglas,
is
for
that
first
gatekeeping
part
of
the
appeal,
which
is
where
the
court
has
to
decide
is
there
merit
in
this
case,
to
make
the
indigent
shift
for
himself.
and
so
in...
in
smith
v.
robbins,
this
court,
specifically
referring
back
to
the
ellis
case,
said
that
the
problem
that
the
court
identified
in
ellis
and
that
became
part
of
the
constitutional
minimum
in
douglas,
was
that
the
old
california
procedure
did
not
require...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
