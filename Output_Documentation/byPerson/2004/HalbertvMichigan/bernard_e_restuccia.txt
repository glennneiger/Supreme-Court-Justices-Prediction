mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
start
with
the
factual
claim
regarding
the
waiver
that
the
court
identified,
pages
22
and
23
from
the
joint
appendix,
being
the
point
at
which
mr.
halbert,
in
fact,
waived
his
right
to
the
appointment
of
appellate
counsel.
i
think
justice
scalia
is
right
in
noting
that
he
was
told
specifically
it's
under
these
conditions
you'll
be
appointed
a
counsel;
under
these
conditions,
you
might
be
appointed
counsel.
from
context
it's
unambiguous
that
he
would
otherwise
not
receive
counsel.
and
what's
important
is
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
45,
the
trial
court,
in
fact,
made
a
factual
finding
on
this
point.
so
in
order
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
mr.
halbert
did
not
waive
his
right
to
appellate
counsel
under
the
particular
circumstances,
you
would
have...
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
the
trial
court
was
clearly
erroneous
in
its
factual
finding.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
yes.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
i...
i
think
that
the
colloquy
makes
clear
that
he
does
not...
he's
not
going
to
have
an
appeal
as
of
right,
and
then
when
told
that--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--i
think
in...
in
context
when
told
that
only
under
these
circumstances
you're
going
to
receive
counsel
in
bringing
discretionary
application,
that
it's
clear
that
he
is
waiving
in
his
decision
to
go
forward
with
the...
his
plea--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--i
think
that
the...
the...
for
the
two
questions
that
are
asked,
he
explains...
the
court
explained
to
him
he
didn't
have
appeal
as
of
right
but
then
said--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--but
then...
and
then
the...
the
following--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--that's
right.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
i
think
that...
i
also
want
to
make
the
point,
of
course,
that
there
was
a
factual
finding,
so
if
this
court
did
conclude,
it
would
have
to
find
the
trial
court
was
clearly
erroneous.
the--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--yes.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
the
advice
concerning
right
to
appeal,
the
one
that
was
used
in
the
trial
court
here,
was
a
form
from
2000.
the...
the
2004
form
is
available
from
the
michigan
supreme
court
web
site,
and
it
has
been
modified
now
that...
because
the
trial
court...
it
seems
apparent
that
he
was
reading
from
the
advice
concerning
right
of...
to
appeal.
the
way
it
reads
now
is
it
will
say
you
are
not
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
appointed
at
public
expense
to
assist
you
in
filing
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal.
so
this...
this...
the
colloquy
now
would
happen
differently,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--i
think...
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
that's
right.
and
they...
they
did...
they
did
modify
the
form.
so
on
the
question
of
the
underlying
constitutionality,
i
want
to...
i
want
to
make
a
few
points,
that
the...
the
threshold
question
really
is
whether
there's
an
appeal
as
of
right
in
michigan
for
a
plea-based
conviction.
michigan
law
is
clear
that
there
is
no
appeal
by
right.
it's
an
application
process
and
it's
a
discretionary
review.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
has
no
obligation
to
correct
errors
in
these
cases,
has
no
obligation
to
review
the
merits.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
no
i'd--
the
law
in
the
sixth
circuit
is
in
fact
in
conflict
with
a
case...
an
earlier
case,
mckenzie
v.
smith...
had
determined
that
the...
a
decision
with
that
language,
that
virtually
identical
language,
is
not...
is
not
entitled
to
deference.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
no.
i
didn't
say...
i
wasn't
suggesting
that.
abela
is
one
case
stating
one
position.
mckenzie,
an
earlier
case,
stated
another
position.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
well,
he
didn't
cite
those
cases.
i--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--i...
i
know
that
our
office
handles
all
the
habeas...
habeas
corpus--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--i
think
he
is
wrong.
the--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--the
solicitor
general
made
that
position
clear
before
the
argument...
before
this
court
in
tesmer
v.
kowalski.
so
we
have
not
been
advancing
that
claim.
in
fact,
we've
been
advancing
a
claim--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--the...
all
the
habeas
petitions
are
run
through
the
office
of
the
attorney
general,
so
that
the...
when
the
solicitor
general
from
the
state
of
michigan
instructed
our
staff
not
to
advance
that
claim,
that
means
all
habeas
cases
in
michigan
essentially
there
will
be...
that
argument
will
not
be
advanced.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
that's
right.
and
because
there
is
no
appeal
as
of
right
under
michigan
law,
this...
the
douglas
case
doesn't
govern
the
disposition.
ultimately
the...
the
controlling
is
ross.
and
the
issue
then
is
whether
michigan
provides
a
meaningful
access
to
an
indigent
defendant
who
wants
to
bring
an
application
for
leave.
that's
really
the...
i
think
the
heart
of
the
constitutional
issue.
there
are
three
distinct
characteristics
of
the
michigan
system.
the...
the
nature
of
the
review
is
discretionary,
and
i
think
comparable
to
the
kind
of
review
in
ross
that
was
described
by
this
court
for
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
mr.
moran
makes
a
claim
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
is
an
error-correcting
court.
with
regard
to
applications
for
leave
where
there
is
no
right
to
have
the
merits
reviewed,
it
is
not
an
error-correcting
court.
in
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
legislation
in
michigan,
the
reason
the
michigan
constitution
was
changed
was
because
of
the
heavy
volume
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
was
facing.
there
are
28
judges
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
and
they
produce--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--no.
they're
panels
of
three.
they
issue
about
4,000
opinions
each
year.
so
each
judge
is
responsible
for
authoring--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--one
court.
that's
right.
so
each
judge
is
responsible
for
authoring
between
130-140
opinions,
having
to
join
in
another
280.
so
resource
allocation
is
one
of
the
pressing
concerns
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
the
situations
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
will
grant
leave
on
application
are
rare.
it's...
it's
reluctant
to
grant
leave
in
these
cases
in
part
because
of
the--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--it's
used
that
standard
order
for
the
last
20
years
or
longer.
the
only
michigan
court
of
appeals
case
in...
only
published
case
in
an
application
for
leave
setting
is
the
bobenal
case
cited
by
the
people
in
our...
the
state
of
michigan
in
its
brief,
in
which
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
said
there
is
no...
this
is
not
a
determination
on
the
merits.
the
only
published
case
for
michigan
in
which
there
was
an
application
for
leave
from
a
plea-based
conviction
is
people
v.
berry
in
which
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
after
initially
having
denied
leave,
then
in
a
collateral
attack
granted
leave
on
the
very
same
issue
and
said
that
its
original--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--they're
supposed
to
raise
those
arguments.
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
that
merits
can
have
different
meanings,
and
it
can...
it
can
relate
to
whether
it
would
justify
the
resources
of
the
court
to
examine
the
underlying
merits
of
the
claim.
i
think
that's
right.
that's
one
understanding
of
the...
of
the
order
that's
consistent
with
the
way
it's
been
treated
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
also,
most
importantly,
by
the
michigan
constitution,
when
the
people
of
the
state
of
michigan
said
trial-based
convictions,
there's
an
appeal
as
of
right.
for
all
other
convictions,
for
plea-based
convictions,
it
would
be
by
leave.
and
michigan's
supreme
court,
in
examining
this
very
question
about
the
nature
of
review,
said
that
it
was
discretionary.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
that's
not
what
happened
in...
in
people...
in
the
bobenal
case,
which
was
a
court
of
appeals
published
decision
where
the
order
read
virtually
identical...
identically
to
this
one,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
could...
would
not
be
bound
by
its
original
denial
of
leave
for
the
lack
of
merits
on
the
grounds
presented
and
reached
the
merits
of
the
claim.
the
same
thing
happened
in...
in
the
berry
case
in
which--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--right.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
the--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--the
court
of
appeals
was
only
examining
its
effect
on
itself,
and
wasn't
examining
on
subsequent
courts.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
well,
but
both...
both
opinions,
in
bobenal
and
berry,
the
court
said
it
was
not
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
in
other
words,
if
a
subsequent
court
then
said
it
was
a
merits
determination,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
holding
from
bobenal
and
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
berry
with
saying
the
merits
have
not
been
reached.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
right.
the
federal
courts
have--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--the
federal
courts
have
been
ambiguous.
in
other
words,
the
abela
case...
they
said--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--yes.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
bobenal
case
said,
in
fact,
examining
virtually
the
identical
language
of
the
issue
raised
here,
that
this
was
not
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
that
it
was
not
itself
bound
as
law
of
the
case
because
the
merits
had
not
been
resolved.
i
think
the
bulger
case
is
kind
of
the
paramount
case
because
it
is
the
michigan
supreme
court
conferring
the
proper
legal
understanding
of
the
applications
for
leave,
and
it
said
that
the
nature
of
the
leave
is
discretionary.
i
think
that
fits
with
common
sense
understanding
because
there
is
no
right
to
have
the
merits
reviewed.
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
say
the
application
were
discretionary
if
a
defendant
would
have
a
claim
to
have
any
error
corrected.
otherwise,
he
would
have
a
claim
on
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
has
full
authority
to
make
the
determination
that
even
if
everything
alleged
is
true,
it's
not
going
to
correct
the
error.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
well,
i
think
that,
in
a
way,
michigan
provides
a...
a
greater
protection
by
enabling
itself.
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
essentially
doing
with
its
review
is
for
the...
for
a
case
where
there's
a...
an...
an
egregious
set
of
facts,
it
can
reach
in
and
grant
an
application
and
review
it
on
the
merits.
it's
a...
it's...
it's
a
kind
of
a
determination
about
resource
allocation,
making
kind
of
the
hard
choices
about
policy
decisions
that
states
have
to
make.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
no.
this...
for...
for
mr.
halbert--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--in
fact,
anyone
who's
very
familiar
with
the
michigan
guideline
system
would
recognize
that
mr.
halbert,
if
anything,
received
a
break
in
the
scoring
of
the
guidelines.
that...
that
ultimately
the
offense
variable
13
is
a
very
easy
answer
to
why
it
was
properly
scored.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
no.
the...
there
was
no
error
in
scoring.
the
offense
variable
13
claim
relates
to
three...
whether
the
defendant
had
committed
three...
three
offenses
against
a
person
within
the...
within
5
years.
michigan
allows
a
determination
based
on
preponderance
even
if
there
was
no
conviction
entered.
mr.
halbert
was
a
serial
child
molester
who
admitted
to
having
sexually
assaulted
his
14-year-old
stepdaughter,
a
10-year-old
girl,
a
6-year-old
girl.
all
that
information
was
in
the
presentence
investigation
report.
there
was
no
objection
to
the
scoring
of
offense
variable
13
because
he
admitted
to
the
sexual
assault.
there
was...
it
was
never
raised--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--right.
the
offense
variable
9
was...
there
was
an
error
with
respect
to
that,
but
it
wouldn't
affect
the
ultimate
position
he
would
be
placed
in
the...
in
the
brackets.
in
fact,
the
only
error
that
did
occur
that
would
have
affected
the
scoring
was
one
in
his
favor,
which
would
have
put
him...
put
him
in
a
higher
bracket.
so
he
in
fact--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--well,
in
fact,
if
anything,
helped
him.
but
on
a
more
basic
level--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--yes.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
yes.
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
that's...
that's
right,
but
i...
i
think
those
claims
are--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--yes.
well,
more
importantly,
the
kinds
of
issues
at
play
for
the
sentencing
cases
are
all
like
this.
they...
they
relate
to
the
minimum
sentencing.
michigan
systems
then
determine
from
a
maximum...
from
a
minimum
to
a
maximum
which
will
get
a...
a
range
of
time.
all
the...
these
sentencing
guideline
cases
relate
to
the
minimum
sentence.
for
mr.
halbert
as
a
sex
offender,
this
is
really
a
question
about
when
he
will
be
eligible
for
release
from
the
department
of
corrections.
he's
going
to
be
facing
30
years
because
all
the
sentences
in
michigan
are
set
by
the
statute.
so
these
arguments
relating
lesser
liberty--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--no.
his...
the
point
of
the
trial
court
there
was
that
the
defendant,
if
he
wanted
to
withdraw
his
plea,
should
have
raised
that
before
the
sentencing
itself
because
the
court
has
discretion
before
sentencing
to
let
him
out
of
his
plea.
after
sentencing,
he
has
to
show
that
the
plea
was
invalid.
so
his
time...
he
was
untimely
trying
to
withdraw
his
plea
because
he
was
concerned
about
consecutive
as
against
concurrent
sentences.
in...
in
summary,
the...
the
michigan
system...
the...
with
the
limited
date
to
the
review
and
the
kinds
of
issues
from
plea-based
convictions
that
are
at
issue
are
not...
are
lesser
liberty
interest
questions
because
they
have
to
do
with
amount
of
punishment.
the
michigan
system
extends
the
relationship
of
trial
counsel
to
the
defendant
and
asks
the
trial
counsel
to
raise
the
motions
regarding
post-conviction
motions
which
will
enable
him
to
have
a
factual
record
from
which
to
advance
his
claims.
he's
not
left
to
shift
for
himself,
that
there
is
a
counsel
appointed
to
identify
those
meritorious
claims--
mr.
bernard
e.
restuccia
--and
that's
always
the
circumstance
for
a
defendant
who's
bringing
a
discretionary
application
where
his
prior
counsel
was
ineffective,
that
he
can
be
left
to
identify
the
meritorious
claims
on
his
own
and
to
make
the
argument
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
that's
true
in
ross
as
well
where
your
first...
where
your
first
appeal
as
of
right,
your...
your
appellate
counsel
is
incompetent.
you're
going
to
be
left
to
identify
those
meritorious
claims,
raise
the
issue
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
to
try
to
avoid
procedural
bars
that
you'll
be
facing.
every
system
is
going
to
have
to
draw
that
line
and
to
say
that
at
some
point
you're
not
going
to
get
appointed
another
attorney.
just
because
there's
access
to
the
system
doesn't
mean
there
always
has
to
be
another
attorney
appointed.
otherwise,
the
point
is
that
you
would
have
to
have
two
attorneys
make
a
review
on
your
case,
whereas
there
is
no
right
to
an
appeal
here
that
this
