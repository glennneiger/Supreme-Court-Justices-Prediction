mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
like
the
sixth
circuit's
invalidation
of
this
michigan
statute
in
the
tesmer
case,
petitioner's
attempt
to
invalidate
that
statute
here
runs
counter
to
this
court's
longstanding
tradition
of
deference
to
the
people
of
the
individual
states
and
to
their
legislatures
in
the
design
and
implementation
of
their
criminal
justice
systems.
as
the
court
said
in
coleman
v.
thompson,
a
case
like
this
is
a
case
about
federalism
because
it
involves
the
respect
that
federal
courts
must
pay
to
states
and
the
states'
procedural
rules.
respect
for
the
state's
choices
is
especially
important
here
because,
as
the
court
put
it
in
medina
v.
california,
preventing
and
dealing
with
crime
is
much
more
the
business
of
the
states
than
it
is
of
the
federal
government.
therefore,
the
court
said
we
should
not
lightly
construe
the
constitution
so
as
to
intrude
upon
the
administration
of
justice
by
the
individual
states.
and...
and
as
to
the
question
of...
of
when
to
provide
state-paid
counsel,
as
justice
o'connor
reminded
us
in
murray
v.
giarratano,
that's
a
choice
that
should
be
one
of
legislative
choice,
especially
since
it
involves
difficult
policy
considerations
and
the
allocation
of
scarce
legal
resources.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
again,
justice
breyer,
it's
a
question
of
allocating
scarce
legal
resources.
if
you...
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
that.
this
case
is
not...
does
not
involve
an
appeal
as
of
right.
it
involves
a
discretionary
appeal,
and...
and
that's
the
vast
bulk
of...
of
appeals
that
are
addressed
by
the...
by
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
so
if
you
impose
here
on
the
state
of
michigan
an
obligation
to
provide
counsel
in
all
of
those
cases,
you
are,
in
essence,
forcing
the
people
of
michigan
to
reallocate
their
legal
resources
away
from
other
cases
or
you're
requiring
the
legislature
to
increase
taxes
to
pay
for
that...
to
pay
for
that--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i
don't
believe
there's
another
state
that's
done
it
exactly
the
same
way.
but
i...
but
i
would
point
out...
and
i
think
this
is
important,
justice
breyer...
that...
that
at
least
according
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
the
bulger
case,
the
majority
of
states
don't
allow
any
appeal
at
all
from
a
plea-based
conviction.
21
of
them
rule
it
out
entirely
and
expressly,
and
another
17
effectively
rule
out
appeals
from
plea-based
convictions
by...
by
allowing
prosecutors
to
impose
that...
impose
a
waiver
as
a
condition
of
entering
into
a
plea.
so...
so
the
relevant
universe
for
comparison
is
quite
small
here.
it's
really
12
states
at
most,
and...
and
michigan
sort
of
fits
within
the
middle
of
those
states
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
resources
that
it
provides
and
opportunities
that
it
provides.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
correct.
it...
it's
discretionary,
and
that's
clear
not
just...
not
just
from
analysis
of
the...
of
the
michigan
courts'
opinions,
but
from
the
provision
of
the...
of...
but
from
the
constitutional
provision
that...
that
created
this
entire
controversy,
which
was
added
in
1994.
it's
article
i,
section
20.
and
that
constitutional
provision
itself
draws
a
sharp
distinction
between
appeals
of
right
and
appeals
by
leave
of
court.
so
even
if
the
michigan
courts
wanted
to
have
a
system
of...
of
mandatory
appeals,
they're
now
precluded
by
the
michigan
constitution
from
doing
that.
and
so...
and
so
clearly,
if
this
court
adheres
to
the
sharp
distinction
and...
which
i
think
is
equally
sharp
and
clear,
that
this
court
has
made
between...
between
appeals
of
right
and
discretionary
appeals--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i...
i
understand,
justice
ginsburg,
but...
but
that's
not
the
distinction
that
i
understand
this
court's
decisions
draw.
several
times
since
douglas
and
ross,
this
court
has
said
that
the
right
to
paid
counsel
addressed
in
douglas
extends
only
to
the
first
appeal
of
right
and
no
further.
and
that's...
that's
coleman
and...
and
finley,
among
others.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
i...
i'm
assuming
that
the
court
was
being
careful
in
its...
in
its
choice
of
words,
and
i
believe
it
was
because
that...
that--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
no,
i
don't--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--that's
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
right.
now,
so...
so
the
real
question
here,
with
regard
to
the
right
to
paid
counsel,
is
does
it
make
sense
to
extend
what
the
court
did
in
douglas
to
this
new
situation.
we
think
it
does
not.
this
court's
decisions,
ross
and
justice
kennedy's
concurrence
in...
in
murray,
as
i
recall,
draw...
draw
a
distinction
between
the
removal
of
barriers
that
the
state
imposes
to
the
exercise
of
litigation
rights
on
the
one
hand
and,
on
the
other
hand,
subsidizing,
affirmatively
subsidizing
litigation
rights--
and...
and
i
think
this
court's
care
in
distinguishing
between
appeals
of
right
and
discretionary
appeals
reflects
a
desire
to
cabin
douglas
and...
and
to
avoid
any
further
excursions
into
the
area
of
subsidies.
and
we
think
that's
a...
we
think
that's...
we
think
that's
good
as
a
matter
of
policy
for
the
court
to
do
that,
for
one
thing--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i...
i
think
that
helps
the
argument.
but
in
fact,
there
are
lots
of
discretionary
appeals
or
discretionary
appellate
proceedings
that...
that
do
result
in
decisions
on
the
merits.
this
court,
for
example,
sometimes
summarily
affirms
or
reverses
on
cert,
and
the
fact
that
the
court
does
that
doesn't
create--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
as...
if...
if
that's
the
question,
i...
i
would
defer
to...
to
michigan
counsel--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i...
i
think
the
distinction
is...
is
not
necessarily
whether
the
decisions
are
on
the
merits
or
not.
i
think
the
distinction
is
between
appeals
of
right
and...
and
appeals
that
are
discretionary.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
well,
i...
in...
in
fact,
i
don't
think
that's
what
happens
in
michigan,
and...
and
i
think
the--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--i...
i
think
that's
true.
whether
it's
an
assumption
of
the
argument,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
so
sure.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
that's
right.
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
it...
it
is
more
difficult,
but...
but
the
disparity
between--
mr.
gene
c.
schaerr
--well,
again,
because...
because
if
you...
if
you
broaden
the
right
to
state-paid
counsel,
as...
as
in
douglas,
you're
going
to
require
states
to...
to
reallocate
resources
to
that
priority
and
away
from
other
priorities.
also,
if
you...
if
you
subsidize
litigation
in
the
name
of
providing
adequate
access
to
courts
or
meaningful
access
to
courts,
then
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
litigation
in
the
lower
federal
courts
about
exactly
how
much
of
a
subsidy
is
necessary
reach
that
standard.
and
also,
if...
and
this
is
particularly
important
here
i
think.
if
you
require
states
to
subsidize
the
exercise
of
a
right
that
they're
not
required
to
provide
in
the
first
place,
like
the
right
to
seek
review
of
a...
of
a
plea-based
conviction,
then
you
give
the
states
a
strong
incentive
to
cut
back
on
or
eliminate
that
right
altogether.
and...
and,
you
know,
who
knows?
but
perhaps
that's
what's
going
on
in
the...
in
the
trend
in
the
states
away
from
providing
this
right.
thank
you.
