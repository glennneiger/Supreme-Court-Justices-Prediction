justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
missing
something
on
waiver,
but
i
would
have
thought
a
person
can
waive
a...
a
right
to
have
a
counsel
on
appeal.
he
can
waive
a
trial.
he
can
waive
a
jury
trial.
but
before
he
has
to...
before
he
decides,
he
has
to
know
that
he
has
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
wouldn't
he
also
have
to
have
the...
to
know
that
he
has
the
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
to
represent
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
equal
protection.
it
has
to
do
simply
with
a
very
common
sense
rule
that
we
apply
in
every
case,
jury
trial,
et
cetera.
so
all
we'd
have
to
say
is,
of
course,
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer.
now,
if
he
wants
to
go
back
and
waive
that
right,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all.
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
all
this
complicated
thing
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
you'd
have
to
say
the
statute
is
wrong
in
taking
away
the
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
he
can
waive
it
if
he
wants
to,
knowing
that
he
has
the
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
mixed
up
again.
what
is
the
answer
to
this?
i...
i
would
have
thought
that
even
if
those
words
that
justice
o'connor
read
referred
directly
to
the
kind
of
appeal
that
we
have
in
front
of
us...
in
other
words,
the
one
that's
at
issue...
that
still
he'd
have
to
know
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer
on
that
appeal
before
he
could
waive
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
does
anybody
dispute
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
at
issue
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
the...
imagine...
i'm
just
repeating
what
justice
souter
said.
there
must
be...
it's
so
obvious
that
there
must
be
an
obvious
answer,
but
i
haven't
heard
the
answer.
he
knows
michigan
law
or
his
lawyer
does.
the
michigan
lawyer
looks
at
the
statute.
it
says
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty
shall
not
have
appellate
counsel
appointed
for
review
with
some
exceptions,
which
they
claim
are
inadequate.
so
he
thinks
the
law
is
shall
not.
i
have
no
right.
so
he
doesn't
not
only...
not
only
is
he
not
waiving
a
known
right,
there's
nothing
for
him
to
waive.
he
has
no
such
right.
now,
obviously,
when
there's
nothing
for
him
to
waive,
how
could
he
waive
anything?
and
obviously,
a
person
who's
told,
hey,
you
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal
no
matter
what
and
then
he
says,
okay,
i
waive
my
right
to
appeal,
i
mean,
really.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
that's
the
end
of
it.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
precisely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
precisely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
we're
deciding
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
exactly
the
issue
in
front
of
us.
is
it
constitutional
or
not
constitutional?
and
waiver
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
sorry.
finish.
i
just
had
a...
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
something
you
said,
but
i
want
you
to
be
finished.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
this
is
what
i'm...
i'm
interested
in.
it
seems
like
michigan
is
unique
here.
why
not
do,
if
you're
worried
about
resources,
what
other
states
have
done?
you
just
say,
okay,
of
course,
you
have
a
right
to
an
appeal
and,
of
course,
you
have
a
lawyer.
we'll
give
it
to
you
if
you're
poor.
but,
by
the
way,
if
you
want
to
plead
guilty,
we're
not
entering
into
that
deal
unless
you
waive
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
take
it
that
the
basic
rule
that
we've
followed...
and
this
is
what
people
are
arguing
about...
could
be
a
criminal
trial
or
proceeding,
plea,
something
in
a
trial
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
emerges
with
a
judgment,
and
then
there
is
going
to
be
the
first
review.
call
it
a
leave
to
appeal,
call
it
an
appeal,
call
it
whatever
you
want,
but
it
is
the
first
review.
and
in
those
two
instances,
state,
if
the
defendant
is
poor,
give
him
a
lawyer.
that's
simple.
that's
clear.
everybody
could
understand
it.
they
may
not
even
have
a
lot
of
legal
arguments.
now,
what
significant...
what
does
that
prevent
a
state
from
doing
that
it's
reasonably
important
for
a
state
to
want
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
other
state
that's
done
it
the
way
michigan
has?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
talking
about
a
piece
of
paper,
that
first
piece
of
paper
saying
to
the
appeals
court,
appeals
court,
please
hear
my
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
it
lists
a
whole
lot
of
reasons
like
a
cert
petition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
those
are
likely
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
i
mean,
they'll
tell
all
the
horrible
things
that
went
on.
and
the
question
is,
is
he
going
to
have
a
lawyer
to
help
him
with
that
piece
of
paper
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now...
now,
it
sounds
to
me
just
the
kind
of
thing
you'd
write
if
you
had
an
appeal
on
the
merits
too.
no.
it's
even
harder.
even
harder.
you've
got
to
convince
them
to
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
draw
that
distinction?
the
piece
of
paper
is
the
same,
even
harder
to
write,
needs
the
lawyer
as
much,
first
chance
he
gets
after
the
trial
court.
why
draw
that
distinction?
