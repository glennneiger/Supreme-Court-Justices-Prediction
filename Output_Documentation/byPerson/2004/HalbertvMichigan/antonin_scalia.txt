justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
he
waive
the
right
to
have
counsel
for
that...
for
that
purpose
since
that
was
the
law
in
michigan?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
was
told
what...
what
right
to
counsel
he
would
have
and
it
didn't
include
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
are
all
disparate
impact
arguments.
there's...
there's...
you're
not
making
any
argument
that
the
state
intentionally
discriminates
against
the
poor.
you're
just
saying
the
effect
of
this
is
harder
on
the
poor
than
it
is
on
the
rich.
but
i
thought
our...
our
equal
protection
cases
have...
have
said
that
disparate
impact
doesn't...
doesn't
hack
it
as
far
as
equal
protection
is
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
whenever
a
state
has...
has
initially
given
a
broad
benefit
to
the
poor,
whenever
it
cuts
back
on
poor...
on
part
of
that
benefit,
it
is
denying
equal
protection
to
the
poor?
that...
that
seems
to
be
an
extraordinary
proposition.
the
state
isn't
picking
on
the
poor.
it's
just
saying
that...
that
the...
the
free
counsel
we
have
agreed
to
provide
in
the
past
we're
no
longer
going
to
provide
in
this...
in
this
one
instance
of
guilty
pleas.
and...
and
you
say
that...
that
is
intentional
discrimination
against
the
poor?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
any
cutback
on
benefits
that
is
given...
on
benefits
that
are
given
to
the
poor
is
intentional
discrimination
against
the
poor.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
this
one
because
that's
your
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're...
you're
retracting
the
pure
equal
protection
claim?
i
don't
think
you
want
to
do
that.
i
mean,
you
would
say
that
even
if
there
were
not
a
due
process
right,
you
would
still
regard
this
as...
as
directed
against
the
poor.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
that
component
wouldn't
exist
unless
you
begin
with
a
due
process
right
to
have
counsel
on
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
moran,
if...
if
you're...
if
you're
tying
your
equal
protection
claim
to
a
due
process
claim
and
if
it
is
not
a
violation
of
due
process
to
require
people
to
waive
their...
i
mean,
you
can
waive
entirely
the
right
to
appeal.
surely
you
can
waive
the
right
to
counsel
on
appeal.
if
that's
not
a
violation
of
due
process,
then
your
equal
protection
claim
dissolves.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
equal
protection
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've...
you've
said
your
equal
protection
claim
hinges
on
the
due
process
claim.
if
the
due
process
claim,
in
turn,
hinges
upon
waiver,
then
apart
from
the...
from
the
dispute
in
this
case
as
to
whether
waiver
occurred
or
not,
if
waiver
does
occur,
there's
no
due
process
claim,
and
then
there's
no
equal
protection
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
their
argument
anyway.
let
them--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
but...
but
that
happens
all
the
time.
i
mean,
the
waiver...
waiver
of
appeal
in...
in
guilty...
in
guilty
pleas.
that's...
that's
not
permissible
either?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
to
if
you're
going
to
make
the
argument
you
just
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
strange
terminology.
it
doesn't
provide
a
right
to
appeal.
it...
it
provides
a
right
to
apply
for
an
appeal,
a
right
to
ask
for
an
appeal.
a
right
to
ask
for
an
appeal
is
not
a
right
to
get
an
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
ask
for
an
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
a
right
to
appeal.
it's
a
right
to
request
an
appeal,
which
can
be
granted
or
denied.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
done
more
than
change
the
method.
it's
changed
the
entitlement.
the
court
can
simply
say
we're
not
interested
in
your
appeal.
it
doesn't
raise
a
significant
legal
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't...
didn't
the
supreme
court
in
the
bulger
case...
was
that
the
name
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
it
say
that
the...
that
the
intermediate
court's
denial
of...
of
appeals
was
a
discretionary
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
dissent,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
means,
i
would
presume,
that...
that
we
would...
we
would
have
to
give...
our
federal
courts
on
habeas
would
have
to
give
deference
to
all
decisions
of
the
intermediate
court
since
they're
all
on
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
courts
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
assume
that
all
factual
and
legal
arguments
have
been
decided
against
the...
the
person
applying
for
a
discretionary
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
had
an
appeal
of
right
until
he
pleaded
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
where...
that's
what
the
waiver
consists
of.
to
say
he
didn't
have
an
appeal
of
right,
no.
that's...
he
had
an
appeal
of
right
up
until
the
point
where
he
pleads
guilty,
and
that's
what...
and
that's
what
the
judge
is
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to...
do
you
want
to
plead
guilty,
even
though
if
you
plead
guilty,
you'll
get...
you'll
get
a
lawyer
only
under
these
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
didn't
say
only--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
your
case
is
a
little
stronger
than...
than
the
court
just
asked...
just
saying
i
must
appoint
counsel
in
this
circumstance
and
i
must
appoint
counsel
in
another
circumstance.
that
might
have
left
open
the
implication
that
you
could
appoint
counsel
in
other
circumstances,
but
the
court
went
on
and
to
say
i
might
appoint
counsel
in
this
circumstance
and
i
might
appoint
counsel
in
the
other
circumstance.
so
if
there's
any
implication
from
it,
the
implication
is
not
just
that
i
have...
i
have
listed
all
the
areas
in
which
i
must,
but
it's
also
i
have
listed
all
the
areas
in
which
i
either
must
or
even
may,
if
there's
an
implication.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
about
grounds
presented
before
we
get
off
this?
is
it
conceivable
that
the
lack
of
merit
in
the
grounds
presented
means
lack
of
merit
in
the...
in
the
grounds
of
application?
is...
is
the
applicant
required
to
state
why
this
particular
appeal
is
worthy
of
being
entertained?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
have
said
the
same,
you
tell
us,
as
to
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
another
court,
and...
and
they
are
not
asserting
that
they've
decided
on
the
merits
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
federal
courts
have
said.
i'm
talking
about
what...
what
michigan
has
said
and...
and
what
the
court
of...
has
the
court
of
appeals
spoken
on
that
subject?
justice
antonin
scalia
competent
paid
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
have
two
appeals
of
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
suppose
if
you
wanted
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
accept
cert
before
we
do
that.
i
thought
the
question
was
that
the
denial
of
an
application
for
appeal
does
not
have
any
merits
consequence.
wasn't
that
the
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
denial
of
an
application
for
appeal
have
any
merits
consequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
always
on
the
merits,
it's
an...
it's
an
appeal
of
right,
it
seems
to
me.
how
can
you
have
a...
a
discretionary
appeal
which
always
decides
the
merits
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
effect
of
the
constitutional
provision
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
so,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
constitutional
provision
that
mr.
schaerr
read?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i...
you...
you
have
the
wrong
one.
i
meant
the
one
that
said
that
applications
to
the
court
of
appeals
are...
are...
require
leave
to
appeal.
what's
the
effect
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
it
says
that
for
the
court
of
appeals,
you
need
leave
to
appeal.
i
thought
they
were
doing
something
there.
what
were
they
doing?
