justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
we
take
this
case
on
the
ground
that
he
wasn't
adequately
advised
or
did
we
take
the
case
on
the
ground
that
even
if
he
were
advised,
he'd
still
have
his
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
take
it
you
would
challenge
the
validity
of
the
waiver
even
if
he
were
advised?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
even
if
he
said,
i
hereby
waive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how...
why
is
that
prejudicial
to
him?
he
says,
okay,
i
can't
plead
guilty.
i
really
did
it
but
i
can't
plead
guilty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
doesn't
he
just
have
a
trial?
he
says,
i'm
not
going
to
contest
the
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
to
justice
souter,
before
i
interrupted,
that
it's...
that
it's
far-reaching.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can...
in
your
view,
can
the
state
require
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
appeal
for
everyone?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
it
certainly
goes
to
the
importance
of
the
significance
of
the
underlying
right.
my
understanding
is...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
in
the
federal
system,
we
require
waivers
of
the
right
to
appeal
frequently,
even
waiver
of
the
right
to
appeal
the
sentence
even
before
the
sentence
is
calculated,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
question
the
lawfulness
of
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
does--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--he
does
go
on
to
say
that...
that
he
can
appoint
a
lawyer
for...
in
certain
instances.
he
doesn't
complete
the
explanation
by
saying
there
are
other
instances
and
when
i
will
not
appoint
one.
that
he
leaves
out,
although
this
a
represented
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
had
a
counsel
at
the
plea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
appeals
as
of
right?
