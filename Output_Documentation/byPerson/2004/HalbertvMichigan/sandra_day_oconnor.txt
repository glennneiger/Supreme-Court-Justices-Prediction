justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
douglas
didn't
involve
a
guilty
plea,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
the
court
say
anything
about
the
effect
of
having
it
be
a
guilty
plea?
i
guess
it
didn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
make
a
difference
or
could
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did...
did
your
client
waive
any
right
to
appeal
here
in
connection
with
the
proceedings
at
the
plea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
did
he
waive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where...
where
do
we
find
the
waiver
here?
is
it
in
the
joint
appendix?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
referred
to
something
that
was
waived.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
would
we
find
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
take
your
time
to
look
it
up.
maybe
counsel
for
respondent
can
find
it
for
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
moran,
here
on
page
22
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
court
is
speaking
to
the
defendant
and
says,
you
understand
if
i
accept
your
plea,
you
are
giving
up
or
waiving
any
claim
of
an
appeal
as
of
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
was
not
effective?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
a
case
where
it
would
meet
the
standard
for
granting
leave
to
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
of
the
error
in
scoring?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
take
the
position
that
in
fact
there
was
no
error
in
scoring.
