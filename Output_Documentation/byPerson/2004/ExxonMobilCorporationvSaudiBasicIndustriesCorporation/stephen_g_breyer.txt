justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
if
they
do,
it's
not
finished.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
i'll
ask
them
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
problem
that
bothers
me...
and
i
don't
know
that
there's
an
answer
to
it...
is
you
have
plaintiff.
plaintiff
goes
into
state
court.
he
brings
a
lawsuit,
a
tort
suit,
a
contract
suit.
and
then
he
decides
he'd
also
like
to
go
to
federal
court.
he
brings
exactly
the
same
suit.
and
here
we
have
two
suits
and
exactly
the
same
thing
running
along
at
the
same
time.
now,
i
know
there
are
principles
from
this
court's
case
law
that
says,
well,
that's
what's
supposed
to
happen.
they've
always
bothered
me.
but
now
let's
take
a
special
instance.
the
special
instance
is
that
in
court
one
in
the
state,
the
plaintiff
loses.
now,
what
he
decides
to
do
is
to
say
to
the
federal
court,
we
want
you
to
review
what
they
did
in
the
state
court.
can't
do
that.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
he
brilliantly
figures
out
i
will
omit
the
word
review
from
my...
from
my
motion.
i
will
ask
for
precisely
the
same
thing
just
not
use
that
word
review.
i
will
ask
them
to
go
and
make
their
decision
which
happens
to
be...
in
my
opinion
should
be...
100
percent
the
opposite
of
what
the
state
court
did
showing
they're
wrong.
but
i
won't
use
the
word
review.
now,
you
say
because
he
cut
the
word
review
out,
he
can
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
can
you...
can
you
expand
on
this
a
little?
i'm
not
taking
a
view
on
it.
i'm
trying
to
clear
up
what's
a
confusion
in
my
mind.
i
see
how
you
could
do
this
on
the
parallel
business
with...
with
delaying
it
on
the
docket
and
using
the
doctrine
of
preclusion.
i
understand
that.
but
we've
still
got
this
doctrine
called
rooker-feldman
out
there,
and
as
long
as
you
have
that
doctrine,
it
strikes
me
as
odd
if...
say,
it
weren't
a
plaintiff.
say
it
was
the
losing
party,
you
know,
that
was
asking
the
federal
judge,
judge,
you
have
this
case
on
your
docket.
let's
move
it
up.
let's
decide
it
now.
he
doesn't
use
the
word
review,
but
everything
else
is
the
same.
he
wants
a
decision
out
of
that
court
that
is
going
to
be
the
opposite
of
what
the
state
court
did.
and
what's
concerning
me...
maybe
i
shouldn't
be
concerned,
but
what's
concerning
me
is
whether
he
can
get
it
or
not
seems
to
turn
completely
on
whether
he
uses
the
word
review
in
the
petition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
you
don't
have
the
check.
what's
left?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
a
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
never
heard
of
a
case
that
isn't
over
until
you
get
the
check.
i
thought
the
case
is
over
when
you
have
the
judgment.
[laughter]
and
then
if
they
don't
give
you
the
check,
you
have
a
different
matter.
we
have
to
get
it
enforced.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you're
still
asking
for
cert..
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
why
is
it
moot?
because
something
could
happen.
we
might
get
this
case
in
theory,
take
it
on
cert,
and
discover
a
jurisdictional
problem
that
somehow
destroys
the
case
without
a
decision,
and
should
that
happen,
there
luckily
for
them
they
have
this
other
case
going.
so
as
long
as...
you're
prepared,
i
take
it,
to
say
you're
going
to
ask
for
cert
if
that's
what
you're
going
to
say,
i
don't
see
how
the
case
is
over.
it's
up
to
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
for...
somehow
you
won
on
that,
even
though
it
sounds
a
little
like
a
state
law
issue,
but
nonetheless,
if
you
won
on
that
and
they
reversed
it
as
a
statute
of
limitations,
then
what
they're
saying
is,
well,
that's
just
why
we
filed
in
federal
court.
we
didn't
want
the
federal
court
to
review
the
state
court.
we
wanted
our
federal
court
suit
as
an
insurance
policy
in
case
something
goes
wrong
with
the
state
court
suit.
it
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
rooker-feldman.
it
is
parallel
adjudication,
just
what
he
said.
now,
what's
your
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's...
you
see,
justice
ginsburg
answered
that.
i...
i
mean,
she
wasn't
answering
my
question,
but
she
did
say
what
was
a
perfectly
satisfactory
approach,
that...
that
the
second
person
says,
you
know,
judge,
there's
another
one
pending
and
the
judge
says,
okay,
we'll
let
that
go
first
except
in
some
unusual
instance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
isn't
it
that
the
end?
i
mean,
here
it's
not
moot.
they
filed
the
other
action.
you
point
out
that
you
not
only
think
something
could
wreck
the
state
claim,
you
would
love
it
to
wreck
the
state
claim.
and...
and
therefore,
they
have
this
insurance
policy
in
federal
court
which
they'll
gear
up
if
and
when
the
state
claim
does
get
wrecked
as
you
hope.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
moot?
or
even
on...
why
does
claim
preclusion
apply?
i
mean,
if
you
win,
from
what
you've
said...
somehow
convince
us
that
this
refusal
to
apply
the
state
statute
of
limitations
properly
violated
some
federal
law,
let's
say...
then
that
would
show
that
the
state
statute
of
limitations
applied
and
barred
their
claim.
would
that
be
sufficient
to
knock
out
the
federal
suit
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is...
does
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
if...
if
it
applied
to
the
state's
case,
does
it
also
apply
in
the
federal
cases,
the
identical
ground
that
everybody
agrees
that
the
state
statute
governs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
you...
if
you
win,
then...
then...
if
you
win
your
state
case,
because
of
the
argument
you
made,
do
you
also
automatically
win
the
federal
case?
is
it
the
same
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
may
not
be
the
same
issue.
then...
then
they
say,
okay,
it's
not
going
to
be
claim
preclusion,
and
you'd
have
to
say
insofar
as
it's
not
the
same
issue,
it's
not
claim
preclusion.
and
therefore,
they
could
proceed
with
their
federal
case,
which
is
what
they
want
to
do
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
we
can't
say
it's
moot
in
any...
and
we
can't
say
there's
an
alternative
basis
where
they'd
win,
can
we?
i
mean,
i'm
saying...
i'm
thinking
if
we
get
into
conference,
we're
discussing
this
case,
and
i
say,
well,
i
have
to
think
this
through,
is
it
the
case
that
if
you're
right
and
you
end
up
winning
in
this
court,
that
their
case
in
federal
court
is
over?
i
think
no,
it
may
not
be.
the
answer
is
it
may
not
be.
then
this
is
not
moot
at
all.
this
is
not
claim
precluded
at
all.
they
then
might
proceed
with
their
federal
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
but
that...
that
isn't
fair
to
them
because,
for
all
i
know,
they
filed
the
federal
case
because
there's
a
different
statute
of
limitations,
say,
that
governs
it
that
will
have
expired
if
you
don't
let
them
file
it
by
the
time...
until
this
whole
thing
is
over.
they
just
wanted
it
as
protection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
explaining
the
unclear
by
the
incredibly
hard
to
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
explaining
the
unclear
by
reference
to
the
incomprehensible.
but
go
ahead.
[laughter]
