well,
what
financial
interests
do
your
clients
have
to
keep
litigating
today
in
another
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what's
going
on?
i
mean,
it's
very
confusing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
given
a
broad
interpretation
to
rooker-feldman
and
have
turned
it
into
something
other
than
the
narrower
view
of
it.
and
i
think
that's
why
we
granted
cert
in
this
case,
to
decide
whether
to
give
it
a
broad
or
a
narrow
interpretation.
the
third
circuit
applies
a
rather
broad
interpretation
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
maybe
that
isn't
a
proper
application
of
rooker-feldman
where
the
complaint
is
not
about
something
the
state
court
has
improperly
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't.
and
so
in
that
sense,
the
third
circuit
has
a
rather
broader
view
of
it
i'd
say.
