mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
good
morning,
justice
stevens.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
begin
with
that,
if
you
would
like.
this
case
is
not
moot
because
there
is
an
ongoing
case
or
controversy
between
the
parties.
there
is
a
judgment,
it
is
true,
from
the
delaware
state
court,
which
has
now
been
affirmed
by
the
delaware
supreme
court.
but
preclusion
doctrines
not
rooker-feldman
and
not
mootness
govern
the
resolution
of
the
claims
that
we
asserted
first--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
don't
know
the--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
certainly,
justice
o'connor,
we've
not
yet
recovered
on
our
judgment
and
that
judgment
is
still
there.
it
is
still
in
existence.
we've
not
yet
collected
on
it.
but
i
don't
believe
that
mootness
turns
on
whether
you
have,
in
fact,
collected
on
a
judgment.
there
are
very
few
cases
out
there
in
which
a
party
has,
in
fact,
obtained
two
judgments,
one
from
a
state
court
and
one
from
a
federal
court,
usually
because
a
party
waived
the
application
of
preclusion
doctrines.
and...
and
we
have
conceded
previously
that
that's
not
our
interest.
what
is
our
interest
here
is
that
we
have
asserted
federal
jurisdiction.
this
case
was
brought
in
federal
court
by
sabic.
during
the
course
of
discovery,
we
found
some
things
out
that
they
had
been
overcharging
us
and
we
indicated
that
we
were
going
to
bring
claims
against
them
in
federal
court.
they
ran
down
to
delaware
court
by
forum
shopping
in
order
to
try
to
obtain
a
shorter
statute
of
limitations,
which
turned
out
for
them
to
be
a
strategic
blunder
of
monumental
proportions.
but
the
federal
case,
when
we
filed
it,
those
claims
had
original
jurisdiction
in
federal
court.
they
have
not
yet
been
resolved
in
a
proper
way.
we--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes,
your
honor.
we
might
not
have
an
interest
in
pursuing
the
case,
but
we
have
a
legal
interest
in
terms
of
article
iii
case
or
controversy.
it
is
well
established
that
the...
the
fact
of
taking
a
judgment
does
not
make
a
case
moot.
in
fact,
if
there
were
a
holding
that
we
think
that
the
federal
case
were
moot--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--in
terms
of
cases
that
involve
injunctive
relief
where
it
is
impossible
for
a
court
to
give
you
the
relief
that
you
have...
that
you
are
seeking,
that
is
true.
but
when
you
are
seeking
money
damage,
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible...
we're
not
saying
that
we're
going
to
ask
for
that,
but
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
the
federal
district
court
could
still
give
us
relief.
and
therefore,
what
we
are
asking
for
is--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--well,
we
think
the
relief
that
we're
entitled
to,
in
terms
of
this,
is
for
the
case
to
be
remanded
for
the
district
court
to
resolve
these
issues
under
preclusion
doctrines.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
preclusion.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
don't
necessarily
intend
to
take
a...
another
judgment
in
federal
court.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
hopefully
we'll
win
on
preclusion
with
respect
not
only
to
this
suit,
the
new
jersey
ii
suit,
but
also
the
new
jersey
i
suit,
which
we
say
the
district...
or
the
delaware
judgment
precludes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
is
likely--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it...
it
is
likely,
your
honor...
and
we
have
previously
said...
that
we
may
very
well
dismiss
the
case
of
our
own
accord.
but
that
doesn't
mean--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--our
claims
are
alive.
there
are
claims
there
that
seek
relief--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we
thought
we
would
not
seek
further
monetary
relief.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
we
have
affirmative
defenses
to
the
new
jersey
i,
but...
but
the
claims
in
new
jersey
ii
and
delaware
are
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no,
your
honor.
we're
not
seeking
additional
monetary
or
equitable
relief.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
and,
indeed,
your
honor.
i
mean,
sabic
has
represented
to
the
court
that
it
likely
intends
to
seek
certiorari
relief
from
this
court
in
the
delaware
suit.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
it
is
not
finished--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--getting
back
to
the
rooker-feldman
issue,
which
is
the
issue
on
which
the
court
granted
cert,
rooker-feldman
is
a
narrow,
limited
doctrine,
but
it
bars
only
appellate
review
not
parallel
litigation
in
federal
district
courts.
rooker-feldman
is
not
a
theory
of
vanishing
original
jurisdiction,
nor
is
it
a
jurisdictional
substitute
for
the
preclusion
analysis
mandated
by
congress
in
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
the
expansive
interpretation
asserted
by
sabic
misperceives
the
fundamental
nature
of
appellate
review.
it's
untethered
to
any
natural
negative
implication
in
28
u.s.c.
1257.
it
illegitimately
displaces
the
application
of
section
1738,
the
full
faith
and
credit
act,
in
most
cases
to
which
it
is
traditionally
applied,
and
it
serves
absolutely
no
useful
purpose.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
no,
justice
breyer.
it's
not
because
he
cut
the
review
out.
rooker-feldman
is
an
issue
of
appellate...
the
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
so
what
does
appellate
jurisdiction
mean?
well,
appellate--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--within
2
months
of
each
other.
within
a
month
of
each
other,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that's...
that's...
your
honor,
that's
our
position
that...
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
a
separate
issue
from
the
appellate
review
issue
that
rooker-feldman
raises.
justice
breyer,
the
answer
to
your
hypothetical
is
that
appellate
review
is
something
different
from
having
a
parallel
action.
appellate
review
is
probably
best
defined
by
two
characteristics
that
i'll
try
to
flesh
out
for
you.
the
first
is
that
the
proponent
alleges
some
sort
of
injury
causing
error
by
the
trial
court
and
not
by
the
adversary
and
then
seeks
an
order
reversing,
vacating,
or
otherwise
nullifying
that
lower
court
order.
when
a
party
alleges
an
injury
by
his
adversary
rather
than
the
trial
court,
the
most
that
can
really
be
said
is
that
you
are
continuing
on
a
parallel
litigation
but
not
that
you
are
seeking
appellate
review.
you
do
not
have
what
looks
like
appellate
review.
you're
not
alleging
errors
by
the
lower
court.
you're
not
seeking
an
order
that
directly
nullifies
or
otherwise
undoes
the
state
court
judgment.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
absolutely.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
that
is
absolutely
our
position,
justice
souter,
that
preclusion
addresses
all
of
these
issues.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
that
is
true.
it
should
not
and
does
not
turn
on
the
words
that
you
use
in
your
petition.
what
it
turns
on
is
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
injury
that
you
claim
and
of
the
relief
that
you
seek.
one
reason
why
you
don't
need
to
be
necessarily
concerned
about
this
is
that
in
all
of
these
cases
in
which
one
case
has
gone
to
judgment
and
there
is
a...
either
a
continuation
or
a
new
case,
preclusion
is
going
to
cover
these.
the
only
extension
of
rooker-feldman
that
sabic
is
asking
for
is
what
they
call
the
actually
litigated
test.
that
is
the
heart
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
act.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
your
honor.
it--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--it
arises
from
a
negative
implication
taken
from
section
1257
and
a
second
negative
implication
from
1331.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
and...
and...
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
and
that's
a
distinction
between
your
hypothetical
and
justice
breyer's.
justice
breyer's,
as
i...
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
that
the
federal
suit
starts
after
the
state
court
is
done.
yours
is
where
you
have
parallel
actions
at
the
same
time.
and
where
the
federal
claims
are
parallel
or
even
filed
first,
as
in
our
case,
you
can't
say
that
the
moment
you
file
those
that
you're
seeking
review
of
some
nonexistent
state
court
judgment.
you're
simply
asking
for
relief
from
something
that
your
adversary
did
to
you.
and
the
argument
that
sabic
makes
that
the
court
relinquishes
jurisdiction
has
no
basis
or
justification
in
anything
this
court
has
ever
said.
it
is
a
theory
of
vanishing
jurisdiction
that
i
cannot
understand.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
of
course.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
and,
in
fact,
that's
what
the
federal
district
court
had
done,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
we
could
either
ultimately
dismiss
it
or
the
federal
district
court
could
say,
looks
like
your
delaware
case
is
over.
sabic
brings
a
motion--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--yes,
or
sabic
brings
a
motion--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--because
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction,
not
of
practical
consequences
other
than
the
mootness
question
that
sabic
has
raised.
but
practical
consequences
are
that
what
we
may
do--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--i
think,
as
in
feldman,
that's
a
question
that
should
be
first
addressed
by
the
district
court.
certainly
we
hope
that
you
will
vacate
or
reverse
the
third
circuit's
judgment
and
allow
the
district
court
to
address
those
issues.
perhaps
we
dismiss
it.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
there...
there
is
a
live...
in...
in
the
terms
of
article
iii,
there
are
live
claims
that
remain
pending
before
the
district
court.
and
while
it
is
true--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--at
the
very
minimum--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--as
a
practical
matter,
we
have
no
intention.
as
a
jurisdictional
matter,
there's
still--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--if
we
did
intend
to
litigate
further,
sabic
would
be
entitled
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
say
they
can't.
they
are
precluded.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
again,
setting
aside
our
intentions
and
hypothetically,
there
are
cases
in
which--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--we...
we
do
not
seek...
will
not
seek
any
further
review
from
the
district
court.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
well,
the
case
is
still
up
in
the
air.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
because--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--the
case...
the
case
is
not
over.
indeed,
because
the
state--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--there
is
a
different
matter.
but
as
a
matter
of
article
iii
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
the...
the
mootness
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
a
situation
where
you
have
a
judgment
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
apply
the
moment
you
get
paid.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
our
argument
is
that
it
would
be
applicable
only
if
the
injury
that
we
claimed
in
our
federal
suit
was
an
injury
caused
by
the
state
court...
the
court
itself
or
the
judge
rather
than
our
adversary
and
we
sought
relief
from
that
judgment.
that
would
obtain
the
nature
of
appellate
jurisdiction
rather
than
we
say,
well,
sabic
did
us
wrong,
we'd
like
a
judgment.
and
then
sabic
can
come
in
and
say,
well,
they're
precluded.
they
already
tried
that.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes.
if
we
alleged
harm
from
the
court
and
sought
relief
from
the
court's
judgment.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
held
any
such
thing,
and
i
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
at
least
feldman
itself.
the
idea
of...
of
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
constitutional
claims
in
feldman
that
were
held
not
to
be
barred
comes
down
in
the
end...
sabic
says,
well,
those
claims
weren't
actually
litigated.
but
the
opinion
itself
on
page
467
points
out
that
the
mr.
feldman
had
raised
his
constitutional
claims
in
front
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
in
terms
of
asking
for
his
waiver.
and
when
i
checked
the
oral
argument
transcript
from
the
feldman
case,
it
was
mentioned
specifically
in
terms
of
mr.
feldman
had
raised
the
constitutional
claims
in
front
of
the
d.c.
court.
and
that's
on
pages
9,
14,
and
16
of
the
lexis
version
of
the
oral
argument
transcript.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes.
well,
yes.
the
district
court
could
then
decide
whether
in
fact
they
were
precluded,
and...
and
it's
likely
that
they
were.
i
didn't
follow
up
on
what
happened
when
the
case
went
back
down
on
remand.
but
the
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
decide
that.
we
will
allow
the
district
court
to
address
that
in
the
first
instance.
and
so
we
think
that
the
actually
litigated
revision
of
rooker-feldman
is
simply
inconsistent
with
feldman
itself,
that
it
improperly
displaces
full
faith
and
credit
that
is
not
true
to
the
negative
implication
from
section
1257
which
has
to
be
a
very
narrow
implication,
indeed,
because
1257
gives
this
court
jurisdiction,
and
it's
only
appellate
jurisdiction,
to
suggest
that
another
court
doesn't
have
that
appellate
jurisdiction
must
be...
must
be
narrowly
limited
to
the
context,
the
type
of
lawsuits
that
this
court
would
seek,
which
is
not
simply
they
did
me
wrong,
please...
please
give
me
money,
but
rather,
that
lower
court
erred.
it
violated
my
rights.
it
is
structurally
or
in
some...
in
violation
of
federal
rights
or
something
that
the
court
did
and
that
you
have
been
asked
to
fix.
that,
we
think,
is
consistent
with
the
proper
negative
implication
from
1257,
but
overrunning
most
of
preclusion
law
simply
is
not.
for
these
reasons,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse.
and,
justice
stevens,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
and
i'll
take
just
a
few
of
them,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
concession
that
the
federal
court
exercised
original
jurisdiction
at
the
time
our
case
was
filed
is
an
important
concession
because
i
simply
do
not
see
yet
still
any
rationale
for
this
idea
of
vanishing
original
jurisdiction.
i
also
see
the
concession
made
in
response
to...
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
about
what
happens
if
they
win
on
the
statute
of
limitations
issue.
well,
one
of
the
cases
they
cite
on
page
12,
footnote
5
of
their
brief,
the
northern
natural
gas
case
itself
makes
clear...
and
there
are
other
cases.
they
went
to
delaware
to
apply
the
delaware
statute
of
limitations.
they
conceded
in
front
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
that
even
if
they
had
won
that,
it
wouldn't
bar
another
lawsuit
in
a
different
forum
applying
a
different
statute
of
limitations.
the
only
way
they
could
even
hope
to
get
the
shorter
statute
was
in
delaware.
the
delaware
statute
would
never
apply
to
our
federal
claims,
so
that
if
somehow
it
went
back
on
that
procedural
ground,
it
would
not
bar
a
trial
in
federal
court.
we
don't
think
that
that's
likely
to
happen,
but
that
is
another
explanation
yet
of
why
it's
moot.
we
also
cited
to
the
court
the
male
case.
it
is
an
old
case,
but
it
does
make
clear
that
when
there
is
the
question
of
jurisdiction
before
the
court
and
some
other
court
rules
on
the
merits,
that
does
not
make
the
case
moot.
in
fact,
you
really
wouldn't
have
a
need
for
claim
preclusion
if
that
were
the
rule
in...
in
mootness,
because
once
the
case
is
final
over
there,
they'd
all
be
moot,
and
you
wouldn't
need
to
apply--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--you're
right.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
i...
i
think
that's
right.
i'd
also
like
to
address,
just
very
briefly,
the
asarco
question.
the
language
that
the
court
used
in
there
we
don't
necessarily
think
was
loose
or
inappropriate,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
reason
was
the
court
cites
at
that
point
an
amicus
brief
by
the
united
states
and
it
cites
a
particular
footnote.
and
what
that
footnote
says
is
it's
a
recommendation
that
the
mining
company
in
that
case
could
file
a
federal
lawsuit
seeking
a
judgment
that
the
invalidation
of
the
statute
was
not
necessary.
but
by
challenging
the
invalidation
itself,
that...
that
looks
more
like
a
direct
challenge
to
the
state
court
judgment.
it's
not
simply
a
relitigation.
so
that
behind
the
court's
language
there...
and
of
course,
it
was
really
just
addressing
standing.
it
was
not
directly
addressing
rooker-feldman.
but
the
us's
suggestion
in
that
case
was
a
suit
challenging
the
state
court
judgment,
and
in
that
situation,
it
looks
more
like
appellate
review,
more
likely
to
infringe
upon
rooker-feldman-type
interests.
in
the
end,
we
believe
that
preclusion
doctrines
adequately
cover
all
of
this,
that
it
is
not
true--
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
--your
honor,
there's
a
question
about
that.
i
mean,
the
court
kept
jurisdiction,
but
there
was
a
determination
that
the
statute
was
invalidate...
was
invalid
and
then
a
remand
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
mr.
gregory
s.
coleman
in
the...
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
believe
that
this
court's
preclusion
jurisprudence
is
not
riddled
with
vagaries,
that
it's
not
difficult
to
understand,
and
that
it's
certainly
not
more
vague
or
difficult
than
the
borrowing
that
they
are
attempting
to
do
to
bring
existing
preclusion
doctrines
into...
in
order
to
expand
rooker-feldman.
preclusion
is
the
answer
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
should
be
permitted
to
address
that
in
the
first
instance,
and
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
thank
you.
